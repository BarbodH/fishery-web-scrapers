790645,BillM,2013-06-05 17:17:00,17367," Uh the Leafs took them to 7 because they out played them, trying to blame it on Boston playing 6 games in 8 days is laughable.    They were outplayed, out hustled and out hit.  Pretty simple.  That being said Boston is playing some good hockey, but Pittsburg played like a junior B team the other night, almost embarrassing.   Looking forward to tonights game."

790708,misfish,2013-06-06 00:01:00,29133,"Was thinking the same thing. Too bad they blew a tire at the end.  It,s game time."
790810,fish_fishburn,2013-06-06 13:22:00,1311,Wow what a game last night. Back to the leaf series. They outplayed and out hit the B's cause the B's were dead tired after playing 6 games in 8 nights to end the season. Seriously leaf fans it wasnt because the leafs are so good. Go ahead and think that leaf fans if it makes you feel better.
790815,BillM,2013-06-06 13:49:00,17367," So they weren't tired in Game #1, #3, #4 or the last 3 mins of game #7, but were tired in #2, #5 and #6?   Is that what you're saying?  LOL!!!!!!!!!!!!  That might be the funniest thing I've read in this entire thread.  Some awesome hockey was played lastnight, the Pens need a break... How many posts did they hit lastnight?  5?   3rd period + both OT's has been the best hockey in this series so far."
790900,davey buoy,2013-06-06 18:48:00,5505,"Ohhh,the leafs were good!Don't make excuses,they beat up Boston bad.!!Too bad the outcome.Just kiddin,lol."
790932,fish_fishburn,2013-06-06 21:29:00,1311,Hard to talk any sense to a leaf fan. lol
790962,BillM,2013-06-06 23:16:00,17367," You're the only one not making any sense in this thread bud, lol.     To think it was because Boston was 'tired' that the Leafs took them to 7 is pretty silly."
790963,misfish,2013-06-06 23:29:00,29133,"Bill,the leafs are gone,gone,gone,LMAO  Last nights game was crazy. I thought after the first goal,here we go again,but the Pens made a game of it.   BBQ PENQUIN ANYONE?????????????????"
790968,BillM,2013-06-06 23:43:00,17367," Apparently gone because Boston got tired for 3 games  Really good game lastnight, Pens deserved that win.  I hope Boston thanked the post the 4 or 5 times it bailed Rask out."
791398,fish_fishburn,2013-06-09 11:09:00,1311,Looks like the B's and the Blackhawks in the final. Should be a great final.
791410,BillM,2013-06-09 14:26:00,17367,Should be an interesting series.
807798,grizzlybri,2013-09-14 20:20:00,565,"Well it is back again, pre-season starts tonight with 3 games. I have to say congratulations to Stirling-Rawdon for getting the chance to host Hockeyville this year."
807927,jedimaster,2013-09-16 03:05:00,3472,"haha, diggin up the past with this thread... I'll bite. What a goal by Kadri. and wear the big A this year I see. shoudl make for an interesting year."
807954,SlowPoke,2013-09-16 13:54:00,2984,"Nice goal fer sure but I don't think the ""A"" will be on the jersey for the regular season. The kid can play - without doubt and I think we've yet to see him really shine. More mature = more smarter! lol"
807987,davey buoy,2013-09-16 19:26:00,5505,"I like him,but the A?,where did that come from?,last minute signing and in there words,give us one full year and we'll talk.Congrats anyways."
786558,Chance,2013-05-14 18:49:00,420,I have to give the edge to the Rangers with Lundqvist in net. When he gets his focus he is tough to beat.The shorter season did seem to have a bit more intensity to the games. I am not sure if it was the shorter season or the players were just itching to play after the layoff. I have always followed the Flames so I got to see alot of Dion and he has not changed much.He was always stuck between an offensive d man and a defensive one.Unfortunately he cannot do either very well and looks lost most of the time.Jack of all trades master of none so to speak.
786564,Chance,2013-05-14 18:59:00,420,"Its funny you keep going back to thinking your drivel bothers me,not in the least. Trolls on the net are rampant and you are just another in a looooong boring line. Your posts however are a waste of bandwidth and really slow down the flow of the thread. Your last three lines are an example.Would you simply not remember to ignore me or did you find it necessary to post in case you forgot ?"
786618,Twocoda,2013-05-14 23:29:00,4130,yep 17 degrees tomorrow....  .....i have voices in my head that argue all the time....im changing their names to Chance and Muskymatt
786638,Chance,2013-05-15 00:37:00,420,When the voices give you the silent treatment you should start to worry.
786654,Twocoda,2013-05-15 01:34:00,4130,ha they are only two of the 17 i have in there....Sybil thought she had attitudes problems (notice the plurals)....mostly i find the silent treatment peaceful...  back on topic though .....as a canadian ..lets see if Ottawa can represent CANADA for  change....  .politically ...we know that isnt going to happen
786662,BillM,2013-05-15 02:07:00,17367,"Canada is represented by probably about 70% of each team in the NHL, lol."
786663,Twocoda,2013-05-15 02:12:00,4130,"do you still believe Bryan Adams, Bill Shatner and Ace Ventura are Canadians? the problem is when the Canadians in Boston win the cup the headlines dont read..THE CUP STAYS IN CANADA!!"
786671,Nipfisher,2013-05-15 02:26:00,2449,"Hey Muskmatt, I enjoy the jabs. Keep 'em up. Leafs were LOSERS last night in the last 10 minutes. They had a decent season and a great series against Boston. Boston prevailed and Leafs are out. I truly believe that the Leafs would have had little (if any) trouble disposing of the HABS. I also believe Boston would have pushed Ottawa around and made short work of them.   Pittsburgh had no trouble with Ottawa tonight and if you Senioritas fans are hanging any hope on Anderson shutting down the Pens.........................GOOD LUCK!    For the reccord I grew up a Nordiques fan and switched to Toronto after the Nords moved to Collarado.  I am now cheering for Canada's last remaining team (not because I like them). Go Sens."
787512,muskymatt,2013-05-20 17:41:00,2608,"  Sens are doing ok against the Pens. Anderson is amazing and now with Spezza back, we'll see what that does to get the scoring going.  Nice to have another laff fan cheering for the SENS(PRAISE ALFIE).  Must be almost half Laff nation switched by now.  Lots of more room!!"
787513,DRIFTER_016,2013-05-20 18:00:00,10439,Anderson and the fact that the Pens went defensive are the only reason that the Sens won that game last night. If it weren't for Anderson they would have been down 4 or 5 zip by the third period.
789274,jedimaster,2013-05-30 03:30:00,3472,Detroit out. Played great as I thought they would but the black Hawks were too much. So the last 4 teams left are the last 4 teams to win the cup. Chic vs la and pens vs bruins this a pretty strong final 4.
789295,muskymatt,2013-05-30 10:27:00,2608,Should make for some good hockey for sure. Pens Hawks final would be stellar.
789316,BillM,2013-05-30 12:58:00,17367,"I'm guessing Pens/LA in the finals, but what I'm REALLY looking forward to is Pens/Boston.  That's going to be an awesome series!   Great hockey lastnight in Chicago as well, really wish Detroit pulled the upset."
789410,davey buoy,2013-05-30 18:55:00,5505,"I'm liking Pens/La as well.There both in my pool,looking good.!!"
789424,misfish,2013-05-30 20:04:00,29133,"All you Crosby lovers ,get yer crying towels. Boston vs LA final."
790472,misfish,2013-06-04 23:05:00,29133,"What,what,what,????????????   The leafs are out,the Sens are out,and this thread drops???????????? PLEASE    The Hawks are doing well,not my team of choice IN THIS SERIES,,but the kings are going to come back. I HOPE.   NOW ON TO,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,  The Bruins/Pens..............  Been a Bruins fan since I was a wee fella..  Pens,I never liked. Ya it,s got Sid the cry baby,just like his mentor,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, Oh wait,,,,,,,,,,,didnt he and he cry to the refs last year and the years before too.  Oh he,s a good player,and likes to think he,s a tough guy,,,,,,,,,,,,with the goalies,but when big PAPA CHUARA comes along,it,s Im sorry sir.LMAO  Just rambling on here.  GO BRUINS GO."
790473,BillM,2013-06-04 23:07:00,17367,"He didn't back down from Chara at all man, what game were you watching, lol.   I give the Kid a bit of credit for that.    Chara won't fight anyone, hell he probably wouldn't even fight Crosby, lol."
790474,muskymatt,2013-06-04 23:17:00,2608,He sure did ragdoll McCabe though lmao
790475,misfish,2013-06-04 23:22:00,29133, Guess you missed game 2 Bill LOL He stayed far far away
790476,misfish,2013-06-04 23:25:00,29133," Yer right,he,ll just slap him silly the next time.LOL"
790480,misfish,2013-06-04 23:41:00,29133,"  Oh why wouldnt he,,,,,,,,,,,,, He was waiting for the jab,then the call.LOL"
790482,BillM,2013-06-04 23:46:00,17367," No one did anything in Game 2, nothing like Game 1."
790483,misfish,2013-06-04 23:52:00,29133, EXACTLY MY POINT.LOL
790643,fish_fishburn,2013-06-05 17:04:00,1311,Boston is really coming around and playing well. That week off before this series did them well. The only reason the leafs took them to 7 was the B's played 6 games in 8 days to wrap up the season. They were really tired and it showed. Chara doesn't have to fight anyone. He knows he is way more valuable on the ice. Crosby didnt back down cause he knows Chara wont hit him upside the face.  Boston has 4 lines rolling now and the Pens are in trouble and they know it. Who is going to start for the Pens tonight? Hate to have to make that decision. By the way Blysma is being out coached big time as well. Go B's Go.
790644,BillM,2013-06-05 17:14:00,17367," Boston didn't do anything either, lol."
786421,muskymatt,2013-05-14 02:38:00,2608,"Well if there was ever a complete, total, self inflicted 3rd period meltdown, that was it!!!!  I mean, even I am shocked at how bad the laffs played that out. Wow!  Just another record for the laffs, I can read it now.  ""LEAFS RECORD BIGGEST EVER PLAYOFF MELTDOWN ""  I may have to save and frame a copy of the Toronto Sun tomorrow!!!  Hey, any chance you laff fans will be interested in another good series? Sens(PRAISE ALFIE) Pitts are coming up!!"
786422,lickmyarmpit,2013-05-14 02:38:00,359,Most epic collapses In history 1 the roman empire 2 the us economy 3 the toronto maple leafs .......too soon   Go wings
786423,fish_fishburn,2013-05-14 02:40:00,1311,"It all came down to lack of experience. The leafs had em down buy wouldnt kick em in the face to finish them off, The b's have the experience to know how to get it done when they got another chance. I dont think the b's are going much further. There spent. The leafs should be proud of themselves, they were taught a valuable lesson tonight."
786426,muskymatt,2013-05-14 02:41:00,2608,"Yeah, how to play hockey"
786427,Acountdeleted,2013-05-14 02:45:00,2562,I...... can't...... even........ what a disaster.
786432,chris.brock,2013-05-14 02:51:00,4053," yeah, I'll try to remember that, keep eyes open! darn!"
786433,fish_fishburn,2013-05-14 02:51:00,1311,You gotta learn to lose before you can hoist the cup. Go Sens go.
786434,BillM,2013-05-14 02:51:00,17367," At least now we can focus on fishing, lol!!!"
786435,muskymatt,2013-05-14 02:54:00,2608," yeah , it's amazing the ice is off before the laffs are eliminated !"
786436,BillM,2013-05-14 02:58:00,17367," There's probably house that requires egging, shouldn't be be out with the other school kids?"
786443,Walleye'm Fishing,2013-05-14 03:17:00,310,"Wow, that was a monumental collapse for the ages. All one can do now is cheer for the only canadian team that advanced to the 2nd round.  Go Sens Go!!!"
786449,Twocoda,2013-05-14 03:43:00,4130,Scalpers are making a fortune off of Kleenex right now....now that the Leafs are done Mother nature will turn up the heat...she couldnt give us warm weather when the Leafs were still standing on ice
786475,bigugli,2013-05-14 11:48:00,6138,"As I've said before, the Leafs are a two period team.  They've  done well this season, but they have lots of room to improve for next year."
786493,Chance,2013-05-14 12:46:00,420,This thread reminds me of a good day of bass fishing. Mostly worthwhile and only one dink .
786495,muskymatt,2013-05-14 13:26:00,2608," Really now! Can you really dispute that a total mocking isn't warranted after that colossal choke. Never again can a laff fan refer to the SENS (PRASIE ALFIE) as chokers,,,,ever!!!!! The laffs have the crown, they have set the bar, the standards have been changed, never to be outdone! Yes laff fans, your team will go down in the history books as having pulled off the biggest complete and total collapse in playoff history. For me , the only thing that could be more gratifying would be the SENS(PRAISE ALFIE) winning the cup!!  Who needs lotto 649 when the laffs are playing"
786497,Jigger,2013-05-14 13:31:00,1237,"I think they played extremely well and surpassed everyones expectations. Sure they choked, but theyre one of the youngest teams in the league and the future looks 10x what it did last year at this time. I'm proud to be a Leaf fan and haven't been that exited for a Leaf team in a long time. Guess this thread is all yours mmatt, have fun heckling yourself. Im out."
786510,Chance,2013-05-14 14:33:00,420,Once again you missed the point. It has nothing to do with hockey it is how you conduct yourself. If you have not noticed all other posts are fairly intelligent yours are just a childish waste of space. Do you post this drivel on the Muskies Canada board Mr.Moderator or is this the only board you do not contribute anything substantial to ?
786517,BillM,2013-05-14 14:49:00,17367,"Wait, Matt's a MODERATOR on another board?  LOL!!!!   I guess the screening process is non existant"
786522,muskymatt,2013-05-14 15:13:00,2608,"Not a moderator on MCI forum, used to be forum director for a few years. Not even a member anymore. Not that any of that has to do with anything here. And to answer your question. No, I do not post regarding the laffs anywhere but here.  The leafs did good, a lot better than anyone expected them too and the fans should be proud.  It would have Been nice to have had more Canadian teams move on from round one.  The future looks good for the leafs and the Sens had better be prepared for next season. A few more trades and the leafs will be that much better.  So lighten up would ya, you should be happy they got as far as they did.  I just think they suck!"
786528,BillM,2013-05-14 15:53:00,17367,We'll take Karlsson...  Take Dion straight up?  LOL!!!
786550,Acountdeleted,2013-05-14 18:08:00,2562,"You know what I can never figure out? As a diehard leafs fan, I want them to do as well as possible, but as soon as they miss the playoffs, I cheer for every other Canadian team INCLUDING the Sens and Canadians. I'd love to see the cup north of the boarder for the first time since 1993. Now I do have a hiarchy (Leafs, Flames, Oilers, Jets, Canucks, Canadians, Sens) but I can tell you I'll be cheering for the Sens over the Penguins.  Why is it that a fan of any other team in Canada can't be a fan of 'Getting the cup back into Canada' vs 'The leafs suck'. Would no one else have loved to have seen Leafs vs Sens this year in the Conference finals? Nope. Lets have another boring Penguins vs Bruins rematch."
786552,Chance,2013-05-14 18:34:00,420,"It has everything to do with this board. You ONLY come here to troll and try and irritate,nowhere else. You think mocking is warranted and you enjoy watching others fail and yet you tell me to lighten up ? I am very happy actually and support every Canadian team. If they win ,awesome,if they lose ,too bad maybe next game. The last thing on my life's agenda is to let the outcome of any sporting event bother me in the least. I think this is a great local board and I have met many of the members. Vast array of knowledge that I can both learn from and contribute when I can. You should try to contribute once in a while and see how it feels. Or possibly try trolling a few hockey boards and see how that works for you."
786553,Rod Caster,2013-05-14 18:38:00,5784,"Matt-1, upset leafs fans-0. Hahaha. Now, go Sens! (I just puked a bit)."
786554,davey buoy,2013-05-14 18:38:00,5505,"I really think the Bruins are going to have a tough time with New York. The Leafs ,let's face it,have worn them down,except for the last 1:22 secs lol.The rangers are bigger than the leafs and their goalie,what more can be said. I will also cheer for Ottawa,but Bill,that trade you have lined up,would be awesome.  .To add,I liked the shorter season.I don't know about you guys. Most interest I've had in a few years ."
786557,muskymatt,2013-05-14 18:44:00,2608,"I choose what I contribut to, that's my right, and nobody will change that. I have contributed since 2006.  If you can't participate in a little playoff bantering then perhaps you should either grow some thicker skin or just plain ignore it and don't participate.  Note to self:  Ignore Chance  Check! !!"
786295,fishnsled,2013-05-13 19:13:00,3520,"The fact that Boston could not fly out of Toronto last night, do to a mechanical problem, will only have Boston that much more tired I would guess. Every little bit helps....  OR  They got all the rest they need.......we'll find out in a few hours."
786296,jedimaster,2013-05-13 19:17:00,3472,Boston and especially chara looked tired. I hope the leaf get on him right off the bat. T minus 4 hours.
786297,davey buoy,2013-05-13 19:18:00,5505,"That's exactly what I thought, could go either way. Your right,we'll see soon enough,about 4 hours ."
786298,fishnsled,2013-05-13 19:26:00,3520, We all know how irritating flight delays and cancellations can be.  It would piss me off if my plane was cancelled and on top of that my team just lost one of the biggest games of the year.  I certainly wouldn't sleep very well.
786301,davey buoy,2013-05-13 19:43:00,5505,"Let's hope they come out mad,and take some penalty's lol. Great series anyways,the Leafs have done better than I would of thought."
786304,fishnsled,2013-05-13 19:51:00,3520,LOL!!  They have done better then most would have thought after that first game.  Fantastic series.
786320,jedimaster,2013-05-13 20:48:00,3472,At the beginning of this series I said if they win a home and away and lose I would be ecstatic. They have surpassed my expectations. Playing awesome hockey right now for the talent pool on the team. I am looking forward to an awesome game.
786343,muskymatt,2013-05-13 22:36:00,2608,"Meh   laffs will fold tonight. Boston hasn't played nearly  to their capabilities, it'll all come together tonight. Book your t offs tonight laffs fans, it might get a bit busy on the greens tomorrow lol"
786344,d_paluch,2013-05-13 22:39:00,343,Go Leafs Go!
786356,jedimaster,2013-05-13 23:50:00,3472,I don't know matt the leafs are playing good tonight. A little sloppy on the faceoffs but other than that it's a solid game so far and a 2-1 lead.
786369,jedimaster,2013-05-14 01:03:00,3472,SCORES SCORES SCORES!!!!!

786385,Christopheraaron,2013-05-14 01:40:00,3525,Any other game this would be a lot of fun to watch...
786404,jedimaster,2013-05-14 02:09:00,3472,"Amazing that the bruins were allowed to throw a water bottle onto the ice to delay the game. The leafs outplayed all expectations this year. Even though it was a heartbreaker ad they had a chance and lost it I am still proud,"
786405,Christopheraaron,2013-05-14 02:11:00,3525,Well let's hope Boston takes it all so we can hold our heads high...
786408,BillM,2013-05-14 02:14:00,17367,"That's a heat breaker, but what can ya do..  Up two goals with 1:22 to go, you shouldn't lose the game.   Looking foward to next season!"
786410,chris.brock,2013-05-14 02:18:00,4053,"after watching 7 games, we are the better team, faster, more skilled, but lacking a great goalie watching the handshake crap, I think our young guys have fire in their eyes, if they would play again now- lookout! the BBs aren't going far, slow, out of shape, goons, hopefully the NYRs make them look stupid"
786411,BillM,2013-05-14 02:19:00,17367,Lacking a great goalie?  You're kidding me right?  He's the only reason we made it to 7 games!
786412,d_paluch,2013-05-14 02:27:00,343,Reimer proved he is number one. Off season training to handle rebounds better and he'll be even better.
786414,knightfisher,2013-05-14 02:27:00,237,I could accept a loss in a close game but to give the game to Boston....what a crushing blow to the fans.
786416,chris.brock,2013-05-14 02:33:00,4053," if you think that's a great goalie you're about as hockey smart as John Ferguson Jr., aside from the Leafs being faster/ more skilled, a great help to make it to game 7 was the BBs being half asleep from game 2 to game 6.5  I love the ReimMinister, seems like a great kid, but he's average"
786418,BillM,2013-05-14 02:36:00,17367," You might have a point if Reimer lost them the series, but he obviously didn't.   The next time you watch a game, I suggest you do it with your eyes open."
785902,davey buoy,2013-05-11 19:29:00,5505,"I agree as well,same could be said for Rask last night. Leafs could of been up 3-0 in the first easily. Reimer IMO,is the reason the leafs even made the playoffs. Let's hope he can do it 6 times in a row!!!!!!!!!!!"
785913,misfish,2013-05-11 20:50:00,29133,"  Sorry Dave dont feel the same. Rask has had good D in front of him.and pretty much an easier time then Riemer. Lots of outside shots.Easy saves. When the leafs get in close,he can be had like a  chicken dinner. Riemer is the better tender here. Cant believe a Boston fan of many years is saying this. LOL Lets go to 7 games."
785914,davey buoy,2013-05-11 21:09:00,5505,"I thought Boston had descent D as well,but if you look right around the back of Rask,you will see a horse shoe.lol.They can be had as you said,and I also agree Reimer IMO was able to get the Leafs to the playoffs. He will need to be strong again Sunday!!!!!!!!!!!Boston's one line could be argueably be the best in the league.That's the only difference IMO."
785939,BillM,2013-05-12 01:14:00,17367,Great game between the Islanders and Pens tonight!
785944,fishnsled,2013-05-12 01:42:00,3520, You can say that again!!
785948,muskymatt,2013-05-12 02:18:00,2608,"Awesome, fast, physical game. I don't think the team that played better in that game won. Should make an interesting series with Ottawa."
785949,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2013-05-12 02:24:00,0,"Reimer had a MUCH better game and definitely made the ""key"" saves for the buds.  They have an uphill battle but with that sort of tenacity and solid effort from Reimer this series isn't over yet."
785985,glen,2013-05-12 13:00:00,2641,What are the odds on tonight's game?
785986,davey buoy,2013-05-12 13:04:00,5505,"Leafs win tonight,than win it in Boston!!!wishfull thinking lol."
785998,fish_fishburn,2013-05-12 13:48:00,1311,"What a game that was last night. The Penguins had more than they could handle. The Islanders are suprisingly fast. If it wasnt for their crappy goaltending they would of won easily. I also noticed that the Pens have a very vulnerable def. Hope the Sens take advantage of that. The Pens now have to face the best goalie in the league, and Anderson is going to give them fits. The only way their going to score is to be right in Andy's face, but Sens big D will take care of that. I say Sens in six"
786000,Rod Caster,2013-05-12 13:59:00,5784,really hoping to see Pens vs. Hawks in final...but I don't know if the Pens can keep enough pucks out of their net to keep moving on.  Earlier in this thread I called Fleury being shaky and pulled!...But I also made a bunch of incredibly incorrect predictions haha.
786007,Jigger,2013-05-12 14:40:00,1237," Great job by the Isles to go down fighting! Wish it had gone the other way. ^^ I also made some poor predictions. Crosby showed why he is far and away the best player in the game.  The future looks good for the Isles though. Glad to see they're back in the respectable column! Hope all your Moms and wives like hockey, should be a barn-burner tonight!"
786015,Rod Caster,2013-05-12 15:09:00,5784,I was also happy with the Isles resurgence into being a good hockey club. Now its time (well past really) for the oilers to do something good!
786103,davey buoy,2013-05-12 21:19:00,5505,"Well just took off my Jays cap,and on with the Leafs. lol. Go Leafs Go!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

786144,jedimaster,2013-05-13 01:02:00,3472,Great game so far. First goal will be a back breaker for either side. Go Leafs Go. That Gardiner pinch was very scary.

786222,BillM,2013-05-13 12:16:00,17367,"Wow what a game lastnight!   The more and more Gardiner plays, the more I like him..   Man that kid has some of the best hockey sense I've ever seen."
786279,Raf,2013-05-13 16:59:00,3495,"maybe just me but boston looked like a tired bunch.  maybe the physical play of the leafs has wore them down over the course of the series.  i've heard and read that many teams did not want to face toronto for that reason -- their physical play.  stuff like that may not be apparent in the regular season but over a long 7 gamer, it takes it's toll.  i guess we'll see tonight!!"
786292,davey buoy,2013-05-13 18:53:00,5505,We'll see alright!!!!!!!!!!!!  Giver guys!!!
785492,Chance,2013-05-09 18:04:00,420,"Your lack of reasoning and your ability to completely ignore the facts makes you quite transparent. Couple that with the lack of ability to put together a competent rebuttal and.......... well I am sure you understand the rest,actually you probably dont. Your main goal in posting is to irritate people,nothing more nothing less.The only issue is your ability to do so and your posts just become a waste of bandwidth. You have what,one maybe a handful of posts in any other thread on the board? There are some great people on the board.Talk to them rather than enjoying trying to irritate them. As far as condescending and trying to ""get somewhere with you"" is concerned, sounds like you took it the wrong way...again. Enjoy the game,root for your team not the loss of another. Enjoy the company of others , dont try to irritate all the time. Throw out a knowledgeable conversation once in a while.You will be completely amazed at how enjoyable it is."
785504,fish_fishburn,2013-05-09 18:51:00,1311,Chance thats way to deep man. Take a deep breath and exhale slowly. There that feels better right.  Doesnt change the leaves though....... they still SUCK.
785513,Chance,2013-05-09 19:56:00,420,"If you are insinuating I am riled in anyway you have also misread and misunderstood my post. Why would someone be bothered in the slightest by something someone posts on a fishing forum, about, of all things hockey? I enjoy talking hockey and hearing all points of view. However when someone who contributes little or nothing at all to the board in general posts drivel,well as I said in the past ,its a waste of bandwidth. I appreciate your compliment though concerning my deep thoughts,thank you. I do wonder though do all sens fans spell names incorrectly,over use the word SUCK and end all sentences with lolol ?"
785515,davey buoy,2013-05-09 19:59:00,5505,"I always liked Dion,but he is slow as I really saw last night. I think his heart is in the right place but the Bruins can sure capitalize on a giveaway.And you can't expect reims to stop 40 plus shots every game he can only do so much. I think if the Leafs can stop the giveaways,they may have a chance one game at a time. Without the giveaways last night,they could of beaten these guys IMO."
785519,Chance,2013-05-09 20:03:00,420,"with Phaneuf it always seems to be a complete lack of effort. Slow I understand ,effort I dont. He just looks like he doesnt care one way or the other. I was hoping to see the Canucks in the final as they looked to be the best bet for a Canadian cup. Now it looks to be staying in the U.S"
785615,muskymatt,2013-05-10 02:43:00,2608,"Great finish by the Sens. Looking forward to round 2.  I do have to say I sympathize with the habs on their battle with injuries.  Still, lots of heart though"
785617,Jigger,2013-05-10 02:49:00,1237,"Guess the Isles are going to take it in 7, not 6..."
785622,Walleye'm Fishing,2013-05-10 03:08:00,310, WOOOOOOOO HOOOOOOOO!!!  I have to say that I have absolutely no sympathy for the Habs regarding their injuries. The Sens endured and overcame injuries throughout the season and Jason Spezza is STILL out of the lineup...  Go Sens Go!!!
785635,Rod Caster,2013-05-10 10:46:00,5784,"wow, Montreal got burried! Good work Sens"
785676,lookinforwalleye,2013-05-10 15:16:00,4399,Nice job by the Sens and props to Turris but I did see a distinct kicking motion with your ass on that goal!!!!
785679,jedimaster,2013-05-10 15:25:00,3472,Well that's why every leaf fan was hoping for a mtl match up in the first round. The has play with grit but it's only about 2000 grit... even the sens with there 500grit were able to walk all over them. at least the leafs outlasted the has and nucks.
785761,davey buoy,2013-05-10 23:15:00,5505,"Only 7 mins in,exciting!"
785762,davey buoy,2013-05-10 23:29:00,5505,Rask is holding them in it. Leafs are all over them so far!
785775,BillM,2013-05-11 00:30:00,17367,Nice job Bozak!  Short handed goals gotta sting
785776,danc,2013-05-11 00:35:00,4677,Yup!!
785780,jedimaster,2013-05-11 00:53:00,3472,Great game so far. Loved watching chara at the bottom of the scrum.

785798,jedimaster,2013-05-11 01:46:00,3472,Phew that was a close one.
785799,danc,2013-05-11 01:48:00,4677,"Wrong Wayne. He called me.  I told him that if they can pull this off, I want a pic of him holding the game winning puck, while balancing his stick across the back of his neck. Just like all of the cool Steelhead guys do. That would be awesome!"
785807,kickingfrog,2013-05-11 02:35:00,8333,"They won the toughest one. Still a long way, but they come home now and then it's one game, winner goes on.   The wings just crapped the bed as I typed this. Two goals in less then a minute. oooopppppsss"

785335,muskymatt,2013-05-09 00:11:00,2608,"Actually I  was born in the 60's, remember, the last time the laffs won the cup."
785336,tb4me,2013-05-09 00:28:00,3295,What a great action filled game so far..Go Leafs Go! Were up 2-1

785368,Dan668,2013-05-09 02:28:00,1120,Thanks Dion. What a joke. Best player on the other team
785369,Nipfisher,2013-05-09 02:29:00,2449,"Tough loss, Well played game with close to 50 shots at Rask."

785374,Dan668,2013-05-09 02:32:00,1120,Better not have the C next year. Put him with komi in the ahl

785384,BillM,2013-05-09 03:25:00,17367, We can agree on this..   I knew it was over as soon as he missed the hit..  I'm like 'Here we go.....'
785408,fish_fishburn,2013-05-09 11:00:00,1311,The leafs were actually pushing hard in ot. I really thought they were going to win. Then Dion has a major brain fart

785426,Chance,2013-05-09 12:59:00,420,For a closet Leaf fan you dont hide your feelings well. By the way its raining outside today so when you go out the door and get wet please dont post about it .Even though it hurts your widdle feelings no need to post the obvious.
785446,muskymatt,2013-05-09 14:22:00,2608,   A little sensitive are we?
785464,Chance,2013-05-09 16:18:00,420,"Sensitive to what ? The fact the Phaneuf is terrible,not likely anyone in the league will tell you that. That the Leafs lost last night and will in all likelihood lose the series.Once again not likely and anyone who has any knowledge of the game will also tell you such. Do I find all your posts silly, of course as most do. I get a good laugh actually once I try to fathom your reasoning. You bounce up and down saying the Leafs suck and the sens are amazing yet the Leafs finished in 5th and sens in 7th. You boast about being born in the 60's and that is the last time the Leafs won the cup. How old were you when the Sens last won the cup ? You go on to say how Leafs have let down their fans for 9 years ,how long have the Sens been letting down fans ? You back up your knowledge of the game by saying you played some ""pretty competitive"" hockey. Playing with the older girls doesnt really count now does it.Thats just a small snippet of your wisdom that all points to a disgruntled Leafs fan. Not to mention the fact you watch every single Leafs game, c'mon now skippy ya know you do.Dont worry little buckaroo its only a game.If the Leafs win they do if not its still breakfast as usual in the morning."
785467,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2013-05-09 16:42:00,0,"Dion definitely crapped the bit on that pinch but its hard to blame him entirely. Sure the final goal was his fault, although I wasn't too impressed with Reimer on the 1st two goals.  He gave up HUGE rebounds all night. Unlike MM who seems to have a severe hate on for the leafs, this sens fan was cheering for the blue and white.  I reserve my hatred for the habs... a team worth hating!Let's hope the sens can ICE the crybabies tonight!"
785468,BillM,2013-05-09 16:46:00,17367,"Reimer dropped the ball on that last goal as did O'Byrne..   Kessel had Lucic covered, you need to make a play on the forward before you're 2ft in front of your own net.  Dion made a massive screw up, but you're right... He's not the only one to blame for the OT loss."
785469,Chance,2013-05-09 16:48:00,420,I agree Reimer should of had that shot. Phaneuf has a habit of trying to make the huge hit and putting himself too far out of position. I am just hoping some Canadian team can win the cup.Unfortunately it doesnt look good for any of them.
785470,Headhunter,2013-05-09 17:02:00,5703,"The Leafs are the masters of their own demise. How many times did we watch them make multiple attempts to clear the puck out of their own zone only to have Boston take possession of the puck? I was literally screaming at the TV watching lame attempt and lame attempt. Burning all your energy in a shift trying to get the puck out of your own zone will always result in the other team scoring. Finally getting it out only seemed to result in a weak dump in to Boston's zone, then a quick line change and they are back to chasing their tails in their own end. I fascinates me how ""professional"" hockey players don't have the ability to move a puck with enough velocity to get it past their opposition. How many times did I see Bozak try to reverse the puck up the boards, only to have Boston's D waiting for the easy turnover?  On a side note, I wonder how long before Garbo ends up being a poster boy for post concussion syndrome? HH"
785472,muskymatt,2013-05-09 17:05:00,2608," I watch all laff games, sure, except the ones they are winning. Why? Because I almost get more enjoyment out of watching the laffs lose than I do watching the SENS(PRAISE ALFIE) win!!  Funny thing is I have probably watched more broadcasted  laff games than most laff fans because maple laff entertainment makes you pay extra for them.  So, yes I have watched ALOT of laffs games over the last 9 years, thanks for the entertainment!! I never boasted about being born in the 60's, I was clarifying, and stating a fact, just as the last time the laffs won was in the 60's. Fact? I think so!!  I also never said that the SENS(PRAISE ALFIE) were amazing, as a fan I support them. I do however think its amazing they made it to where they are with all the injuries they had and have, call it character. Something fanuf is lacking, unless its a comic character, like goofy or something!!  I do like however, that you acknowledge that fanuf and the rest of the laffs suck and that they are going no where in this series. Regular season means nothing as everyone knows that the playoffs is a different animal all together. Apparently you, and the laffs, were not informed of this.  Being condescending will get ya no where with me  GO SENS GO (PRAISE ALFIE)  GOODBY HABS"

784807,muskymatt,2013-05-07 01:50:00,2608,"Wooohooo lets go Bruins. What a great game, took nine years for the laffs to let down their fans in the playoffs.  But they managed to do it as expected. Maybe the laffs should have played with some of the grit the SENS (PRAISE ALFIE) did last night. Lolol"
784822,jedimaster,2013-05-07 02:49:00,3472,For a sens fan you sure seem to love to watch leaf games. Regardless I don't think you were watching the same game tonight as the leafs outplayed the bruins. Outside of 3 costly turnovers The leafs played pretty good. Too much line juggling imo. Get some flow and let them play. Better game by Gardiner lots to build on for the next game.
784837,Chance,2013-05-07 03:22:00,420," There is that in depth knowledge again. As far as letting down fans in the playoffs is concerned the sens are well versed in that .How many appearances in the last 9 years and no cup?? Nice logic skippy , have another run at putting together a bit of logic. Oh and by the way it is lol not lolol,cant even get that right,pure genius I tell ya right der."
785041,glen,2013-05-08 00:16:00,2641,"""Visiting player stick down first.""  What was up with the refs? Anyone shed some light on this."

785150,Harrison,2013-05-08 12:26:00,2202," Visitors stick must be down on the ice first, then the home teams, then the puck drops.  Very common to hover your stick above the ice. It is a common trick everyone does, they are just cracking down on it. This is why we see alot of guys being thrown out of faceoffs.  Great read on this thread, arm chair fishermen have nothing on arm chair hockey fans."

785308,Christopheraaron,2013-05-08 23:04:00,3525,I'll say 3-2 leafs

784435,jedimaster,2013-05-05 02:52:00,3472,"Oh yes, very interesting. I have a feeling like the legs will be motivated on Monday night. They darn well better. Like I said before. If they skate and hit, they can score with the best of the league. Happy Leafs fan here."
784437,tb4me,2013-05-05 03:18:00,3295,Who hoo Go Leafs Go!!! Great game..
784439,glen,2013-05-05 03:27:00,2641,He ain't no Timmy Thomas. Nice wheels on Garbo. Orr is on chara.  Riemer is solid.  Nice line shuffle. Effort from jvr. Great play by the team.  Less shots on leafs goal would be better.  Now they know they can win.  Leaders of the team stand up.
784442,davey buoy,2013-05-05 09:26:00,5505,"With that kind of effort last night,they can play against anyone!,  .But will they show up Monday or not?lol."
784444,Rod Caster,2013-05-05 10:43:00,5784,Good game indeed! The TSN girls are doing a great job at reporting on the game and keeping my attention this morning
784457,lookinforwalleye,2013-05-05 14:15:00,4399,"Everybody has an opinion and yours does not surprise me, mine is this the guy targeted a players head and took advantage of a fellow player who was in a vunerable position suspension imho was warranted!!! And I will hazzard a guess that if it was Prust who did the same thing to Karlsson you`d be singing a different tune!!!!"
784479,Chance,2013-05-05 17:33:00,420,"A nice example of respect happened last night when Thornton and Fraser fought.Fraser had his arm caught in his sweater and Thornton just held on until he got it free. Now is that figure skating etiquette or should he have taken advantage of the situation and whacked him a few times? I can tell you this, I still remain in touch with quite a few friends that I played junior with and they had nice careers in the NHL. I also have two relatives currently playing,one in the playoffs and one out. Every single one of them to a man said that was NOT a simple hockey hit gone wrong. That was a guy trying to make the big hit and a statement by taking advantage of a guy looking the other way !!!"
784481,fish_fishburn,2013-05-05 18:14:00,1311,"Your allowed to hit in the NHL but just not to hard. You have to protect yourself on the ice. In a situation like that, let that pass go and chase it. Then on the bench tell you dman if he sends another pass like that hes gonna get a punch in the face."
784488,tb4me,2013-05-05 18:56:00,3295,"With all due respect he HAD to be hit. Have a look at the winger breaking up the middle waiting for the next pass. Its a breakaway without that hit. Did he have to hit him that hard? Who knows, its not like he had a few seconds to think about it..It is what it is..I still say its ignorance to blame anyone but the Dman clearing the puck."
784490,Chance,2013-05-05 19:06:00,420,Oh you can hit as hard as you like just not when a guy is vulnerable and there is a good chance of serious injury.
784493,Whitespinnerbait,2013-05-05 19:20:00,2038,"  By far, one of the most common sense replies ever on OFC.......  :worthy:"
784496,Chance,2013-05-05 19:26:00,420,"Sure he had to be hit,however did he have to try and seperate him from his soul ? its called letting up ,players do it all the time.Is every hit a big thunderous occasion? The object of a hit in hockey is to seperate the player from the puck.That was a statement hit plain and simple. As far as how much time he had ,well he had plenty of time to judge the play. Players think at a different rate of speed than the average fan. Ask anyone making the jump from the A to NHL and they will tell you the biggest difference is the speed.Keep up or get out. He saw the play developing and took an opportunity to hammer Eller. I will say it again ,a suspension was given for a reason ,to send a message. I am sorry but I find it laughable when people put the blame for the injury on the D man.Yeah he put him in a bad spot but he sure as hell didn't force the hit! Let me guess the guy who gets rammed head first into the boards is responsible because he turned his back on the play right? So the league now needs to suspend players who either put someone or themselves in vulnerable positions. i mean what was the poor guy to do he had to at least try and break Eller in half after all the D man put him in that spot,right ? Once again its all about respect.You see someone in a bad spot back off,do your job,make the hit but let up a little. Too many times we see the talent of the league have an uncertain future due to lack of respect."
784578,kickingfrog,2013-05-06 01:52:00,8333,I shoulda put money on it.
784601,Walleye'm Fishing,2013-05-06 03:50:00,310,"Men against boys tonight, hopefully the series continues this way...  Go Sens Go!!!"
784627,Rod Caster,2013-05-06 12:36:00,5784,Montreal got clubbed. Frustration is dripping out of their pores!
784632,muskymatt,2013-05-06 12:53:00,2608,"Subban has no class. Lots of cheap , dirty shots by Montreal. Looks like they have a whole team of small man syndrome.  Total domination by Ottawa. We'll see if there will be any suspensions for those head shots. Oh yeah an Therien is  a whining little suck."
784636,BillM,2013-05-06 13:35:00,17367,Great game between the Sens and the Habs!  Saw the highlight reel!!   I wish I watched it on TV!    Awesome!
784639,Walleye'm Fishing,2013-05-06 13:42:00,310,"I just heard on Ottawa radio that there was a Canadians fan who took off his Habs jersey at the game last night after Subban sucker punched Turris while he was laying helpless on his back.  Montreal radio said that the only statistical category in which the Habs won in last night's game was taking punches in the face.  So after the Sens handed the habs a beat down at centre ice in a line brawl, habs players decided to hand out numerous cheap shots for the final 12 minutes of the game. That's o.k., we'll take a timeout with 18 seconds remaining in a 6-1 hockey game.  Pageau, Pageau, Pageau, Pageau, Pageau, Pageau!!!  Well done Sens fans, well done."
784652,Chance,2013-05-06 15:28:00,420,"Lots of cheap shots by both teams. Too bad really as it could of been a good high tempo game with a nice show of skill that they are both capable of. Instead it was a cheap shot slap fest . High school girls against grade school girls. Habs got frustrated and tried to play the same game.Unfortunately they are ill equipped in that department. Subban looked like a punk giving it to team mates and then taking a shot at Turris who was in a vulnerable position.Total lack of respect . Hmmm heard that somewhere before.    He will win you games and lose you games all by himself. As far as the time out is concerned MacLean should of been a bit more intelligent and left it alone. He wound up the Habs,had them where he wanted and then could not resist a final parting shot. Do not mistake what happened last night as a true representation of the Habs . They are a great team with plenty of skill. MacClean should of left them embarassed and demoralised instead of throwing gas on the fire and possibly waking the tiger. Not sure what Turris did but he seemed to be the target all night long. Perhaps a cheap shot of his own or just maybe an easy target. My guess is something was said or done as he was also the target as Georges I believe fired the puck at him right at the end of the game. Not a great idea as those kind of moves come back to haunt you. Leave those kind of cheap antics to you know who"
784656,muskymatt,2013-05-06 15:44:00,2608,Not a great moment for an otherwise excellent career.  I'm sure ALFIE would like that back. I didn't support it then and don't think it was right last night either
784657,Chance,2013-05-06 15:48:00,420,"The problem with those moves is the outcome which could be horrific if the player is looking the other way. Good players ,bad decisions ,luckily neither resulted in an injury."
784658,BucktownAngler,2013-05-06 16:13:00,582,
784697,lookinforwalleye,2013-05-06 20:49:00,4399,Shouldn`t be a problem for you as your Chris Neal does that all the time!!!!
784699,lookinforwalleye,2013-05-06 20:52:00,4399,Josh is not that type of player I figure something was said/done to initate that.  Should be a interesting game 4!!!!!
784332,Sebastian,2013-05-04 13:15:00,208,"The Gryba hit was clean(even Kerry Fraser couldn't screw up that call.) Craig Anderson has been incredible. Great game last night. The Habs neutralized the Sens well. You have to admire Price passing his tooth to his bench and skating back to the net!  Every series so far has been exciting. Got to love the playoffs. Hard to believe 5 months ago, we had no hockey.  Hopefully the Leafs can rebound tonight. Go Leafs Go!"
784344,tb4me,2013-05-04 16:14:00,3295,Oh we go this. Were right back in it tonight. Go Leafs Go. Please?
784345,kickingfrog,2013-05-04 16:18:00,8333,"Very frustrating to see the result punished rather than the act. Farance's elbow was an intentional non hockey play when the puck was not present and Grabo doesn't appear to be hurt at the time. The other play was everything the first one wasn't but the player is badly, and graphically, injured. Gryba is suspended for doing his job well and the 2 habs doing their's poorly, and if he doesn't make that play he is not in the line-up next game."
784350,Leecher,2013-05-04 17:31:00,7832," Here's what I think of this.... it was a clean hit all right  ​  Gryba took him out cold   aiming for Eller's head knowing Eller wouldn't see him coming... which sent him unconscious and hitting the ice, face first    How cool is that  And let's not talk about the blood splat showing on the ice  before Eller hit the hard surface as he was falling  and why I say this... because I was watching the game in HD on my 46"" flat screen TV  It was obvious to me that the initial shoulder hit to the head took him out and he was cut even before hitting the ice hard  Only shows that Gryba committed himself to taking him out at all cost and to me was a poor decision on his part.... Glad he got 2 games for this    Next time Gryba will think twice about committing himself to hitting a player blind sided.  And I know what you're going to say... only a habs fan can see fault in this legal hit    yeah call it what ever you darn want... it still was a poor decision to hit a blind sided player like that"
784357,Chance,2013-05-04 19:10:00,420,"Agreed ,its called a predatory hit.Scott Stevens made a career of it. These were the type of hits that were responsible for stars such as Lindros etc not living up to there full expectations. Its all about respect and backing off when seeing another player in a vulnerable position."
784361,muskymatt,2013-05-04 19:46:00,2608," So let me get this straight! You two would rather there be a bunch of Nancy's out there skating around?  How about this, if you want figure skating then go watch figure skating and let the men watch a real mans sport!!  Works for me!"
784363,Chance,2013-05-04 20:05:00,420,"From your perspective of never playing the game I can somewhat understand your point of view. However real men ,as you put it, do not take advantage or try to injure someone who is vulnerable,or for that matter gate off on an internet forum concerning something they have no idea about. Leave the hockey discussion to those who have played or are playing. After all I would never try to give you advice on a hotdog eating contests. Go get em tiger ,just two more and ya got the record."
784365,Leecher,2013-05-04 20:09:00,7832, Yep.... as expected.... lack of respect reply from a Sens fan    just like the fat walrus coach of yours
784366,muskymatt,2013-05-04 20:25:00,2608," I've played hockey for the last 43 years FYI!  A lot of it was at a pretty competitive level.  I've been a fan that long as well.  I think I know hockey pretty well actually.  Seeing as you know absolutely nothing about me, you may wish to refrain from passing judgment on something you know nothing about.  Now that that is cleared up, I think I'll go have the best tasting hotdog on the planet. Maybe a beer as well!"
784367,kickingfrog,2013-05-04 20:26:00,8333,"Very few people like to see a player hurt like that. The league still allows the head to be hit, the new rules, as the currently sit, are that head cannot be the principle point of contact. By the letter of the rules, as brill cream head pointed out, that hit is not worthy of even a penalty."
784368,muskymatt,2013-05-04 20:29:00,2608," Exactly!!  NO one wants or likes to see anyone get hurt, that said, and as the majority have said. LEGAL HIT should not have been a penalty."
784377,Leecher,2013-05-04 21:01:00,7832, Note to self:  Don't even try to understand muskymatt's reasoning or anything else... he knows it all and nothing else matters.....
784382,Chance,2013-05-04 21:38:00,420, Your comments are all revealing about your knowledge of the game.
784387,tb4me,2013-05-04 22:18:00,3295,Big game tonight! Go Leafs Go! I think we got this one..!!

784391,muskymatt,2013-05-04 22:24:00,2608," As much as I hate to say it, it would be nice to see a strong performance from a Canadian team. That said, it doesn't mean I'll be cheering them on."
784400,kickingfrog,2013-05-04 23:21:00,8333,A series doesn't get interesting until someone loses at home.
784402,kickingfrog,2013-05-04 23:25:00,8333,Easiest contest ever: Worst regular anthem singer in pro sports is larry the lounge lizard that sings in the garden. Complete tool.
784405,muskymatt,2013-05-04 23:33:00,2608, He could easily fit in any 70's cheese movie in that role lolol
784411,Christopheraaron,2013-05-05 00:42:00,3525,"Just listening in the car for now, sounds like this is going to be a good game!"
784412,jedimaster,2013-05-05 00:45:00,3472,2-1 Leafs... How that last flurry didn't result in a goal is beyond me. Rask has horseshoes tonight. Should be like 4-1
784414,davey buoy,2013-05-05 00:56:00,5505,"Far better effort by the leafs. Great game!!!,just go go go !!!!!!!!!!lol."
784421,jedimaster,2013-05-05 01:27:00,3472,Hopefully the coach keeps slapping them around a bit. They all have jump today. and SO SO SO awesome that kessle put one in the back of the net.
784423,danc,2013-05-05 01:56:00,4677,Mission accomplished.  Split on the road.
784424,DRIFTER_016,2013-05-05 01:57:00,10439,Much better effort tonight!!!!!
783933,muskymatt,2013-05-02 11:43:00,2608,"Why do you think Boston traded Kessle?  It was because he wasn't a team player, wouldn't listen to the coach, was a suck hole and pouted like a little girl when he got hit or didn't get his own way.  Now he's a laff and you fans expect him to be different, good luck with that."
783935,Chance,2013-05-02 12:01:00,420," Blow wind blow,found your set yet,check the purse might be there."
783999,davey buoy,2013-05-02 18:58:00,5505,"Kessel was a part of a trade,no one went to him and said we don't want you.The fans could give him a break but that's rivalry. I'm a die hard leaf fan and hope they do well,The neutral zone giveaways,and maybe A full game effort would do it!!!!!!!!!!! They made the playoffs,who would think they could go much further?I hope they can. Reimer let them make the playoffs,but can't take that many shots every night?. Go Leafs Go!!!!!!!!!!"
784007,BillM,2013-05-02 19:35:00,17367, You better hope the Sens fair better against the Habs tonight then we did against Boston!  LOL!
784013,DRIFTER_016,2013-05-02 20:20:00,10439, Bill Don't you know the Sens are the second coming of Christ? PRAISE ALPO!!!!
784025,muskymatt,2013-05-02 21:13:00,2608," The only way we could show worse is if we didn't show up, oh wait, the laffs didn't show up either.  If, and a big if, the Sens(PRAISE ALFIE) did manage to lay a stinker the way the laffs did, which is almost impossible to play that bad, I would expect nothing less than total razzing. That is if the laff fans can put down their Kleenexes  long enough to type.  They were already talking about kessle being moved if he doesn't do something, anything , during the playoffs.  "
784033,Walleye'm Fishing,2013-05-02 21:47:00,310,Go Sens Go!!!
784044,BillM,2013-05-02 22:10:00,17367,Why would Boston fight at all up 4-1?  They aren't stupid.. And you won't find Chara fighting any of the tough guys..  He's worth too much..   Torontos 4th line was probably the best line out there all night.
784056,misfish,2013-05-02 22:50:00,29133," It should of been right off the hop. Thats where they lost it. They played like that the whole season..Tough in yer face. Me thinks the next game will be alot different,but win or lose,one of my teams is gone.  Sens out in 5"
784109,knightfisher,2013-05-03 03:15:00,237,Habs got a reality check tonight.  Good game by the Sens.
784111,Walleye'm Fishing,2013-05-03 03:26:00,310,Go Sens Go!!!
784138,Chance,2013-05-03 11:44:00,420,Blow wind blow...MEOWWWWW
784161,muskymatt,2013-05-03 13:49:00,2608,Well its pretty obvious the Sens (PRAISE ALFIE) fared better in their series opener that the laffs. No congrats necessary though. The laffs might want to take notes on  how to show up for a game lol Go sens go
784162,davey buoy,2013-05-03 13:53:00,5505,That's one statement I can agree with as of late. Go Leafs Go!!! lol.
784163,BillM,2013-05-03 13:56:00,17367,Glad I stayed up and watched Detroit/Anahiem lastnight!  What a 3rd period!
784203,DRIFTER_016,2013-05-03 16:59:00,10439," Yeah, it was pretty good hockey wasn't it. I don't even have to stay up late to watch it.  I do have to agree with Matt though. The Sens did play a good game and their goalie was outstanding and reason they won that game. The hit on Eller was a good hit, just had a bad ending. I hope he's doing OK. Diaz should receive a beat-down from the rest of his team for that stupid pass."
784211,muskymatt,2013-05-03 17:51:00,2608, Ditto. Brutal play that put his teammate in a horrible compromising situation.
784231,muskymatt,2013-05-03 20:56:00,2608,"2 game suspension for Gryba, won't be long now before hitting is not allowed in the league. Wrong call NHL, you blew this one big time."
784237,DRIFTER_016,2013-05-03 21:24:00,10439,I don't agree with that either. If that hit was worth 2 games then Ference's blatant elbow to Grabo's head should have been worth 5 games.
784238,tb4me,2013-05-03 21:24:00,3295,Dude for once I couldn't agree  more with you.. There is a first for everything. Sens fan or not your 100% right. Even Kerry Frasier says its a clean hit http://video.tsn.ca/?dl=main%2Flatest%2F1%2F0%2F918384%2Fclip%2F100   
784241,muskymatt,2013-05-03 21:49:00,2608, LOL
784260,davey buoy,2013-05-03 23:18:00,5505,"Good to see the kid back!!! 1-0 already,feeling a little bad for the Islanders.Now Crozby with there 2nd goal.2-0. I'm wearing out the letters on the last channel button lol. Crosby with his second of the period Wow!!"
784265,Rod Caster,2013-05-03 23:53:00,5784,Crosby is simply awesome.
784275,tb4me,2013-05-04 00:28:00,3295,Unreal Crosby first game back and has the playoff scoring lead in under 7 minutes...lol  Ohh NY just tied It up at 3..
784330,Rod Caster,2013-05-04 13:02:00,5784,Not looking good in Vancouver.....  Really suprised to see the Islanders comeback... Good job to them!
783789,davey buoy,2013-05-01 19:26:00,5505,"Matt,that's low! lol."
783805,Jigger,2013-05-01 20:14:00,1237,"The short story doesnt favour the isles at all. Outscored 16-5 the last 4 meetings for the series win. Tavares held to 2pts. However, Crosby figured on 9 of those. So when you remove his pts, itbecomes a little more fathomable that the Isles have a shot. This is Nabokovs last kick at the can and I think he'll rise to the occasion. Couple that with a younger, faster team in the Isles, i think this is the big upset in the East. The D is a little small though and Morrow, Iginla and Malkin will be all over them. Letang will be key in stopping Tavares and Moulson. Hes having a Norris year. Still calling Isles in 6 esp if hothead Crosby comes back and messes with the chemistry of the team."
783810,Rod Caster,2013-05-01 20:34:00,5784,"Pens will destroy the Islanders in 5 or less!.The Islanders have little to no playoff experience on their team.  Crosby a ""hothead"" haha."
783811,davey buoy,2013-05-01 20:42:00,5505,"I hope so,but the Islanders?give them a little credit,we'll know soon enough.,Sid and the Penguins are good for the game imo."
783813,Jigger,2013-05-01 20:46:00,1237,Puh-leeeeze one facewash and Crosby will become irate. Its a well known fact that he loses his cool on a regular basis. They should sit him for the series.
783815,Rod Caster,2013-05-01 20:48:00,5784,"Whatever he's doing, he should keep doing...  except getting hurt...he should do that less."
783816,davey buoy,2013-05-01 20:48:00,5505,Let's agree to disagree  .lol.
783825,Jigger,2013-05-01 21:20:00,1237,Not denying hes the best player in the game.
783829,glen,2013-05-01 21:30:00,2641,Ya there just the toughest team in the league. Boston will skate away scared.
783853,jedimaster,2013-05-01 23:13:00,3472,SCORES!!!!!!
783855,davey buoy,2013-05-01 23:41:00,5505,Just had to say it again  . 
783857,muskymatt,2013-05-01 23:54:00,2608,Lets go Bruins
783858,Dan668,2013-05-01 23:57:00,1120,If they keep playing like this they'll be back in Florida with their clubs
783859,glen,2013-05-01 23:59:00,2641,It ain't over yet.  Orr is ready to go.
783860,muskymatt,2013-05-02 00:05:00,2608,"Where is he going to go? To the showers ? Lolol. Golfing ? Lolol . Maybe to buy some kleenex lolol Get some bandaids for his ground draggin knuckles lolol  Laffs are going down , Bruins dominated that period and Kessel has already mailed it in woooohooo"
783865,glen,2013-05-02 00:24:00,2641,Orr is going to lay down the law.

783872,chris.brock,2013-05-02 00:59:00,4053,"   I know where the Sens are going to go tomorrow night, on their knees, for a good, hard .........  the Leafs are playing poorly, but the refs are lovin' the home town applause"
783876,glen,2013-05-02 01:09:00,2641,Hit something.
783890,jedimaster,2013-05-02 01:58:00,3472,Pretty weak effort all around. I mean if you aren't gonna play kessle you darn well better deal him in the summer.
783891,BillM,2013-05-02 01:59:00,17367,"If that JVR shot was into the net instead of the post at the end of the first period, it would have been a completely different game.  Congrats to the Bruins, not really surprised they took game #1."
783897,Rod Caster,2013-05-02 02:31:00,5784,That takes a bit of wind out of the sails.....  Great game by the Pens too
783900,muskymatt,2013-05-02 03:09:00,2608, if if if if if if if if if if if if .......waaaaaaaaahhhhhhh........no offence Bill but your team sucks!!!
783901,muskymatt,2013-05-02 03:11:00,2608,  I've been saying that for years!
783931,jedimaster,2013-05-02 11:33:00,3472,If it was me I would put kessle out on every chara shift and tell him to suck it up and play against him or not dress. Who cares if he hit you once. Grow up kessle are you wearing a sens jersey under your leafs jersey? I do agree that id that jvr shot went in I think the outcome would have been vastly different. The reffing as usual was brutal and reimer was being exploited high on every single shot.
783154,davey buoy,2013-04-29 19:17:00,5505,"Leafs playing a period or two with under 20 shots per game doesn't help. At least we will get one playoff round which many can't remember lol. I remember that was all we really asked for,anything else was a bonus.  ."
783188,Chance,2013-04-29 20:45:00,420,"Boston in 4 hmmmm,care to put your money where your mouth is ,or is it just all hot air......as usual."
783189,lookinforwalleye,2013-04-29 20:48:00,4399,"IMHO the booins are ripe for the pickin...bunch of big slow forwards and slow D, pressure the D and the puck will be turned over, Rask has been their saving grace.Leafs in seven!!!!  As fars as the Sens/Habs go should be a interesting series, Ottawa one of the worst offenses in the league bouyed by great goaltending. They should be low scoring close games but the Habs are a allround better team, Habs in six!!!"
783190,lookinforwalleye,2013-04-29 20:50:00,4399,I'll take a piece of that too!
783194,Chance,2013-04-29 21:11:00,420,"Awesome,looks like we can put some serious cash together.Unless of course old wind bag strikes again !"
783203,muskymatt,2013-04-29 21:44:00,2608," I'm not going to wager when my team is not in it..lolol..I'm not a laff fan..lol  I'll just sit back and watch the laffs implode. After all, it's not like they can draw from their last 9 years of playoff experience.  Heck, half the team probably were in diapers the last time the laffs were in the playoffs."
783206,muskymatt,2013-04-29 21:51:00,2608,"I predict, yes, I'm good at that too!   The first time Chara crunches Kessle, will be the last time Kessle tries to skate with the puck.  Marchant and Lucic will have Kadri and Lupul so tied up and scared, they won't want to touch the puck.  Reimer will be on the bench after he gives up 5 goals in the 1st period of game one and he'll never recover mentally.  Laffs are done, already, and the game hasn't even begun.    "

783316,kickingfrog,2013-04-30 00:47:00,8333,"Unlikely, but they might be last year's devils. ie get the easiest first round opponent of any team of the 16 teams."
783362,StarTzar,2013-04-30 01:41:00,51,Go SENS Go
783396,jedimaster,2013-04-30 03:17:00,3472,"Habs or sens? That's like choosing between a kick in family jewels or a punch in face. I think the habs got this one down though. Even if price forgets to put on his pads the sens will have a tough time scoring goals.  As for the leafs well, I don't think they will win but I am going to root for them none the less and scream if they lose. The one thing I will say, is they can score, skate and hit with the bruins. Its defense and proven goaltending that puts the bruins over the top."
783398,kickingfrog,2013-04-30 03:21:00,8333,No cake walk for the leafs by any means but the bruins do not have proven goaltending and the Leafs have 2 scoring lines and chara can't shutdown both.
783437,Rod Caster,2013-04-30 11:51:00,5784,"My probably-inaccurate predications:  Toronto very unlikely will overthrow Boston. Recent history says not chance. However, they'll play well.  Price will carry the Habs easily past the Sens. Gallagher and Galchenyuk will show the Ottawa youngsters how to play. Alfie will have an adult diaper incident on the ice and set a very weird precedence.  Rangers will send Torterella to the E.R. with 'exploded head sydrome' with their non-ability to score even past a shaky Washington goalie. We will see Lundvist get very frustrated.  Pittsburgh will destroy the islanders... but we'll see Vokoun replace Fleury for at least one game. Fleury will be under the spotlight bit time.  -----------------  Chicago will destroy the wild. All bets will remain on Chicago for the cup. Kane, Toews and Saad will blow everyone's mind with amazing goals/plays.  Detroit will upset Anaheim rather easily. Their playoff experience will show. Lots of respect will be shown for Selanne!  Luongo will play well, Vancouver will move on in no less than 7 games. This series will tap them out and they'll have a difficult time in round 2.  Kings will easily get past St-Louis, although the Blues will represent themselves very well."
783438,Jigger,2013-04-30 11:58:00,1237,"The Bruins are a much deeper team, esp if Bozak remains on the sidelines."
783451,Headhunter,2013-04-30 13:19:00,5703,"For the Leafs to beat Boston, they are going to have to play Boston's game, better than Boston. That means a physical war and I think the Leafs are deeper than Boston in the guys willing to give and take a hit department. Which ever team that can outlast the other, will be victorious. As far as the Habs and Sens go, I already have tickets to the ballet, so I'll take a pass on that series. HH"
783459,mr blizzard,2013-04-30 14:01:00,1589,"Habs and Sens HH said it best,,,,,,I am going for the Leafs but City of Boston is on the rebound and justifiably so,  their fans are going to be loud and proud, going to be a great series."
783497,kickingfrog,2013-04-30 16:32:00,8333,"The bruins were ""deaper"" and better last year and couldn't beat an awful caps team in the first round. This Leafs team isn't the same one that had thier butts handed to them the last few seasons by the bruins. Doesn't mean T.O. wins in 4, but it does mean the matchup isn't the walk-over that some are predicting."
783761,Jigger,2013-05-01 15:38:00,1237,"""Pittsburgh will destroy the islanders... but we'll see Vokoun replace Fleury for at least one game. Fleury will be under the spotlight bit time.""  The Pens are going to be wondering what happened after the Isles take the series in 6."
783775,davey buoy,2013-05-01 18:24:00,5505,"Do you not know there history with the Islanders?,that is the one team they have trouble with."
783779,glen,2013-05-01 18:39:00,2641,I hope the leafs have there knuckles well rested for tonight.  Payback time.
783786,muskymatt,2013-05-01 19:12:00,2608, Actually the laffs knuckles will likely be a little tender with them dragging on the ground and all!
782776,jedimaster,2013-04-28 03:20:00,3472,"Leafs finish in 5th. What a great season for such low expectations and minimal trades.  Afaik this is where it stands.  For the Leafs If the Bruins get 2 points we play Montreal in the first round If the Bruins get 1 point or lose tomorow we play the Bruins  For the Sens If they get  0 points they finish 8th and play Pens. If they get 1 point, they tie islancers but get the tie break so finish 7th and play Boston If tthey get 2 points they lose the tie breaker against rangers and finish in 7th and play Montreal  The first tiebreaker is Regulation or overtime wins(no shootouts) Second tie breaker is record agains the tied team"
782851,kickingfrog,2013-04-28 13:30:00,8333,"So gang besides ""your"" team, which first round match-up are you most looking forward to?  The Blues and the Kings in the west might be a reel battle. The Blues will be looking to avenge the second round defeat from last year. Kings may not have the same level of goaltending that they had in 2012. Too bad the games will be late."
782872,jedimaster,2013-04-28 14:32:00,3472,It will be interesting to see how the canuck goalie drama plays out. As well the red wings after sneaking over the last week as well of course chicago after dominating the league.
782874,Nipfisher,2013-04-28 14:35:00,2449,I am looking forward to seeing how the Wild match up against the Hawks.

783015,TheMaverick,2013-04-29 01:42:00,93,4-2....... It's on like donkey kong......go habs go!
783022,Walleye'm Fishing,2013-04-29 01:58:00,310,Finally. Ottawa vs. Montreal in the playoffs. 'Can't believe it took this long... Let the rivalry begin...  Go Sens Go!!!
783026,muskymatt,2013-04-29 02:09:00,2608,"Habs suck , no where close to as much as the laffs, but suck all the same. Sens in 6 Boston in 4, that's if the laffs don't throw in the towel before then."
783035,jedimaster,2013-04-29 02:26:00,3472,Sens and habs will be a good series. Well like two fruit flies mating. Haha
783042,kickingfrog,2013-04-29 02:39:00,8333,"Looks like the Leafs play games 1&2 Wednesday, Saturday. That other series will be Thursday, Friday."

783052,DRIFTER_016,2013-04-29 03:50:00,10439,GO HABS GO!!!! GO LEAFS GO!!!
783116,fish_fishburn,2013-04-29 16:11:00,1311,"Oh oh, leaves vs the bruins. Bye bye leaves. Bruins in 5. You heard it here first."
783118,BillM,2013-04-29 16:13:00,17367, Got any lotto number predictions for us?  LOL
783121,fish_fishburn,2013-04-29 16:19:00,1311,Now the Sens and the Habs will be a really good series. Going to be some really fast tempo there. And yes the Sens can skate with the habs i'm just a little concerned with their goal production. I predict the sens in 7. Sooner if Price doesnt get back to his old ways.
783136,Nipfisher,2013-04-29 17:28:00,2449," Boston has beat the Leafs 3 out of last 4 games but the last 2 games have been close (March 7, 25th). The new style the Leafs are able to play matches the Bruins better then any other team in the conference. IF the Leafs can play tough and get good goaltendning then they have a great chance of beating the Bruins.  I am actually cheering for Ottawa to beat Montreal, but it wil be tough. Habs and Sens split their season series. They were all tight low-scoring games. Now if Price / Budaj play better then Anderson / Lehner the Senioritas are gonna have BIG problems."
783152,solopaddler,2013-04-29 19:04:00,8605,"Ottawa vs Montreal...unfortunatly one of those piss poor teams has to win.  Not too thrilled about Leafs vs Bruins. No illusions here, Reimer will have to play out of his mind for them to have a chance."
781836,Nipfisher,2013-04-24 00:49:00,2449,I heard MLSE has raised the playoff ticket prices by 70%. They should be ashamed of themselves.
781838,Steve,2013-04-24 00:50:00,2075,why? they are a business.
781842,muskymatt,2013-04-24 00:56:00,2608,"Exactly , and the last time the laffs were in the playoffs, tickets were $20 each lolololol"
781846,muskymatt,2013-04-24 01:02:00,2608,"Laffs sheeple fans , money in the bank, they've got you in the palm of their hands. Offer a brutal product with high hopes for a 9 year period, add a slight hope phase, and they'll pay 10 fold."
781847,Steve,2013-04-24 01:03:00,2075,"more than half of that arena is there for free.  tickets go up 70%, more than half that arena is still there for free."
781935,tb4me,2013-04-24 14:03:00,3295,Ill wait to see if the Sens make the cut  before I make my commet beyond this...
781961,Jigger,2013-04-24 16:30:00,1237," Because the chances of getting a good seat during the regular season relies on the kindness of others, I would consider this a ""tax the rich"" type scenario."
782094,jedimaster,2013-04-24 23:43:00,3472,I would pay 70% more than regular season prices for play off tickets. Oh btw leafs up by 1 in the first.
782146,BillM,2013-04-25 03:00:00,17367,"I hate watching the Leafs after a 3 day lay off.  They always come out flat, todays game was a great example."

Ottawa can (and is the only team that) can knock the Leafs to 6th.  Montreal can finish 2nd and if they do then boston is 4th.  First tiebreaker is most combined regulation and overtime wins.  Clear as mud?

History of Lord Stanley's cup has its beginnings generally accepted as around 1892, and the cup's history is not the NHL's history. The first 9 Stanleys were won by Montreal teams. You can be certain that Toronto counts the wins made by the Blueshirts and Arenas in their totals as well. These titles are attributed to the Ottawa Senators- 1903, 1904, 1905, 1906, 1909, 1911, 1920, 1921.1923, 1927 Also interesting is that Kenora once won a Stanley Cup, as did Victoria and Seattle."

781779,davey buoy,2013-04-23 21:58:00,5505,Have you tried nhl.com?
781781,tb4me,2013-04-23 22:05:00,3295,Ya you gotta pay to view more then 5 minutes if a game..
781783,davey buoy,2013-04-23 22:08:00,5505,"Really?,should of known. Seemed to easy."
781784,DRIFTER_016,2013-04-23 22:09:00,10439, I've got TSN-JETS so I don't need one. Sorry.
781785,tb4me,2013-04-23 22:11:00,3295,Ok thanks anyway..Ill do some searching..I want to see that game..Go Jets Go! a jets win tonight would put the Sens out..For now
781211,Handlebarz,2013-04-21 01:47:00,3790,Dang the playoffs what is that? I better not have to be watching the leafs on June first win the Stanley cup I will be musky fishing
781212,Jigger,2013-04-21 01:47:00,1237,"Wheres Muskiematt, i cant wait to see his new sig!"
781213,DRIFTER_016,2013-04-21 01:48:00,10439, It's amazing what can happen when you get a coach that can actually coach!!!! GO LEAFS GO!!!!  WOOHOO!!!!!!!
781215,danc,2013-04-21 01:49:00,4677,There's nothing better than a road trip to Ottawa to end your mini slump.
781217,kickingfrog,2013-04-21 01:51:00,8333,Owned!
781218,DRIFTER_016,2013-04-21 01:52:00,10439,"HMMMMMMMMMM, lets see now. There were 5 games between the Leafs and Sens this year. I wonder who won the series. The Sens? Well they did win one game."
781220,tb4me,2013-04-21 01:55:00,3295,Where was that bar that was offering free drinks for all leafs games again? Hey MM lets see the shiny new sig change?
781222,muskymatt,2013-04-21 02:18:00,2608,"Well it was hardly being owned as one Laffite put it but none the less the laffs did manage to make the playoff after setting the bar for sucking the last 9 years. So I will congratulate the laffs for not sucking a bad as the last 9 years, and actually making the playoffs.....imagine that  after nine years  Sig changed! ouch"

781236,Nipfisher,2013-04-21 05:09:00,2449,"Luvin the signature change! Thought we bet the Status Change? Anyways, good bet Muskymatt and I do believe the Sens will make the playoffs too."

781254,muskymatt,2013-04-21 12:39:00,2608,Oops which one is the status
781255,Nipfisher,2013-04-21 12:43:00,2449,"Main page is your status, just click on your name at the top right of the page and update status. But I am o.k. with what you did. It is all in fun."
781281,kickingfrog,2013-04-21 14:30:00,8333,"   A 4-1 record this season, with 2 shutouts and a 4-0 playoff series record = OWNED!"
781282,BillM,2013-04-21 14:38:00,17367,"Muskymatt, good job man.  I know that must have stung a bit  Let's hope Ottawa can make the most of the of rest of the season and join the Leafs in the playoffs."
781313,muskymatt,2013-04-21 19:16:00,2608,This is like the slowest 24hr period I have ever seen in my life
781314,Nipfisher,2013-04-21 19:22:00,2449,I'm enjoying every minute Matt.
781316,salmon,2013-04-21 19:44:00,334,Hey MM I hear Alfie is looking for a new caddie  
781319,kickingfrog,2013-04-21 19:55:00,8333,For what it's worth  The Leafs' have the first tiebreaker against all the teams in the East except the Pens. The chance of them catching both habs and the bruins is slim but they do have that tiebreak buffer on the teams trailing them as well.
781328,Roy,2013-04-21 20:50:00,13728,God lov'em.  I don't follow the hockey much..all I know is that Team 4 is in 1st place in the OFC tourney.
781343,Nipfisher,2013-04-21 22:30:00,2449, They are one heck of a team Roy.
781345,jedimaster,2013-04-21 22:44:00,3472,Can't argue with that roy.   and btw... Sens are now tied for 8th....
781367,Walleye'm Fishing,2013-04-22 00:07:00,310,"Woah the Sens are in for a rough ride over the next week. I'll be at the game tomorrow night, hopefully they can pull off a win over the mighty Pens."
781400,jedimaster,2013-04-22 02:14:00,3472,If they get in they deserve it. They don't have much room for error unless the jets fold.
780679,muskymatt,2013-04-19 00:43:00,2608,
780680,Dan668,2013-04-19 00:43:00,1120,Look like crap the past few games. Cant get a shot on net or worse out of their own zone.
780713,knightfisher,2013-04-19 03:50:00,237,"It's good to see the leafs will make the playoffs though they may drop in the ranks. However the leafs can't continue to allow the opposition so many shots per game. And it's silly reading on some sports sites, the blame going on the goalies. It's the lack of defense and defensive help by the fowards. The defense has been spotty all year, Of course turnovers don't help. Clearly the leafs have no leader. Need a new captian, which of course has been said by many. Islanders have proven to be a contender, which they showed again tonight. Good thing there are not 82 games this season."
780715,BillM,2013-04-19 03:56:00,17367,Lupul needs the C!
780891,Nipfisher,2013-04-20 00:09:00,2449,"So Saturdays game between Toronto and Ottawa?  Muskymatt, how about a friendly wager?  If Toronto wins (which they will) you need to put Go Leafs Go as your status all day Sunday. I am willing to put Praise Alfie as my status for Sunday should the Senioritas win. How about it?  Blair"
780892,irishfield,2013-04-20 00:13:00,26272,LOL
780918,muskymatt,2013-04-20 01:10:00,2608,"Hmmmm....very interesting proposition  Normally, and as a rule, I don't participate in one on one fan interrelations with a fan from a team that hasn't made the playoffs in 9 years. Actually, it's an unwritten NHL fan rule, but you wouldn't know that because the rule applies to the laffs.  But I digress, and having considered many things, such as the fact that the laffs seem to have  returned to their usual sucking selves, and that the SENS(PRAISE ALFIE) have a regular player(Cowen) back in the line up and their #1 goalie. Inspite of the fact that the sens are still riding  a minor league roster, I will take your wager.  You are on NF  GO SENS GO"
780920,irishfield,2013-04-20 01:13:00,26272,Just thought I'd quote it before he changes his mind Blair !!
780926,muskymatt,2013-04-20 01:17:00,2608,"No worries, I'm a man of my word!"
780934,irishfield,2013-04-20 01:25:00,26272,I'm sure you are Matt... just some humour for a Friday night.  You should come up in the fall.. and hit GBay with me!
780936,Nipfisher,2013-04-20 01:26:00,2449,"""It's on like bing-bong"" Silas Robertson - Duck Dynasty"
780943,muskymatt,2013-04-20 01:38:00,2608,"Thanks for the offer, we'll talk!"
780962,Jigger,2013-04-20 02:32:00,1237,"Not a bad bet on MMs side. Leafs really need to make a statement Saturday. They've come out flat the last two outings and need to get their legs under them. But if the Sens play the game they played against Washington, the Leafs will be in for a long night. Looks like the wrong teams are waking up at the right time. Winnepeg, Washington, NYI and Ottawa are all rolling at full mast."
781185,davey buoy,2013-04-21 00:40:00,5505,"JVR,two goals so far!!!!,still a long way to go. Go Leafs Go!!"
781190,tb4me,2013-04-21 01:02:00,3295,slow game so far compared to the others..Go Leafs Go 2-1 after 2
781198,sturgman,2013-04-21 01:21:00,249,Good game so far and its nice to hear a canadian broadcasting classic tonight! Bob Cole... Go leafs! 
781201,tb4me,2013-04-21 01:35:00,3295,Kadri! 3-1 5 min left...Go Leafs Go!!
781203,tb4me,2013-04-21 01:39:00,3295,lol the fans are chanting Go Leafs Go in Ottawa.. Awesome.. made my night..Looks like Alfie is hurtin.. Hardly played tonight..
781204,Nipfisher,2013-04-21 01:43:00,2449,4-1 whoooo-hoooo!
781205,Jigger,2013-04-21 01:43:00,1237,Lupul seals the deal! Let the playoffs begin!
781206,tb4me,2013-04-21 01:45:00,3295,Leafs win We have a playoff spot clinched. I love this team...
781207,Jigger,2013-04-21 01:45:00,1237,"Wow, 47 saves for Reimer tonight!"
781208,jedimaster,2013-04-21 01:46:00,3472,Thanks for the free pass sens. You suck as always...
781209,tb4me,2013-04-21 01:46:00,3295,Great time for him to get hot..
781210,chris.brock,2013-04-21 01:46:00,4053,hey MM-   !
779996,davey buoy,2013-04-15 23:31:00,5505,Different start tonight by leafs. Not hitting so far.It's early but being out shot as well.
780016,chris.brock,2013-04-16 00:20:00,4053,"we're looking better in the 2nd, NJ just can't put pucks in the net, if we score 1st I think we've got a great chance at 2pts  I always liked Steve Sullivan, if he's cheap, I'd like to see him back in TO"
780018,kickingfrog,2013-04-16 00:26:00,8333,"I like him as well, but it's a young man's game."
780020,Nipfisher,2013-04-16 00:38:00,2449, Found it on LeafsTV
780023,DRIFTER_016,2013-04-16 00:45:00,10439, Same as always: http://ourleafs.blogspot.ca/
780026,chris.brock,2013-04-16 00:55:00,4053," I said if he's cheap  Brodeur is older than dirt, but I'd rather have him back-stopping the Leaf's upcoming playoff run than Reim or Scrivens"
780035,jedimaster,2013-04-16 01:17:00,3472,yah when I tuned in it wasn't working all good now. WHAT A FrEAKIN SAVE!!!! HOLY......
780036,DRIFTER_016,2013-04-16 01:17:00,10439, HOLY MACKINAW!!!! If Reimer can play like this through the playoffs all is good. He's made some awesome saves in the 3rd.
780039,jedimaster,2013-04-16 01:22:00,3472,SCOREESSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
780040,DRIFTER_016,2013-04-16 01:23:00,10439,WOOHOO!!!!!!!!
780055,tb4me,2013-04-16 01:40:00,3295,Wow what a game by Reimer..2-0 we win! we win! 53 points 2 wins in the next 6 and we clinch!!
780123,jedimaster,2013-04-16 13:28:00,3472,A win tonight and a loss by Winnipeg and its a clinch. second overall is only 2 wins away...
780128,Jigger,2013-04-16 13:59:00,1237,"If Mtl and Bos keep playing the way they have, the 2nd seed is a definate possibility! Washington is going to be a tough game tonight."
780132,jedimaster,2013-04-16 14:22:00,3472,This will be a good test against a team that is streaking and ready for the play offs with all guns blazing.
780137,kickingfrog,2013-04-16 14:39:00,8333,"Washington has been racking up most of their points against their division. They have confidence no doubt, but they are the best of a week group of teams. The Leafs have to play better then they did last night."
780139,Jigger,2013-04-16 15:14:00,1237,Not like their arms are sore from shooting the puck last night...
780170,davey buoy,2013-04-16 19:04:00,5505,"For sure,and Ovi showing up,They do need to play better. Scrivens in tonight as well."
780215,DRIFTER_016,2013-04-16 23:02:00,10439,LUPEs is back!!!!
780221,tb4me,2013-04-16 23:37:00,3295,Go Leafs Go! Here we go.. Down 1-0 come on boys!
780222,chris.brock,2013-04-17 00:05:00,4053,"I think the chippier the game, the more advantage for the Leafs, the Caps don't have the horses if it turns into a war, and when the game gets tough, the softies disappear  at least Ovi doesn't look that motivated offensively"
780236,muskymatt,2013-04-17 01:22:00,2608,What's the score anyways ?
780241,DRIFTER_016,2013-04-17 01:30:00,10439,It's a shame that it looks like the Leafs are going to drop to only having earned points in 13 of their last 15 games. How have the Senioritas been doing Matt?
780259,bigugli,2013-04-17 02:26:00,6138,That didn't go so well
780667,chris.brock,2013-04-19 00:10:00,4053,"tough task at hand for the Leafs, it's hard to beat both the refs, and the New York Dive-landers"
780677,DRIFTER_016,2013-04-19 00:37:00,10439,Not just the refs. They need to start skating!!
779556,davey buoy,2013-04-14 00:01:00,5505,"Kadri is raising a little hell out there tonight!,things could get ugly in the second."
779557,DRIFTER_016,2013-04-14 00:02:00,10439,Good first period. If they keep it up it'll end up 12-3!!!
779560,tb4me,2013-04-14 00:04:00,3295,Awesome first..I had a friendly arguement with  some guy in a Habs jersey in Harveys last night.. I wish i could see the look on his face right now..Ha ha ha..
779570,DRIFTER_016,2013-04-14 00:50:00,10439,I would be willing to wager that he is crying in his poutine!!! Actually he probably doesn't care since the Habs have clinched a playoff spot. He will only be worried if they face the Leafs at some point.
779571,davey buoy,2013-04-14 00:52:00,5505,They meet last game of the season I believe as well.
779578,DRIFTER_016,2013-04-14 01:16:00,10439,Yep.
779581,DRIFTER_016,2013-04-14 01:29:00,10439,  
779590,danc,2013-04-14 01:51:00,4677,wow...
779612,tb4me,2013-04-14 04:54:00,3295,That almost brings a tear to the eye
779654,BillM,2013-04-14 15:42:00,17367,"If Kadri had another 4inches and 30lbs on him, he'd be really dangerous, lol."
779680,muskymatt,2013-04-14 18:05:00,2608,Blah blah blah. And if the laffs didn't suck for the last 48 years maybe somebody other than a laffs fan would take them seriously. That hit was an illegal one and should be a suspension.  Kadri will be a marked man now. He'll get his  lolol
779688,kickingfrog,2013-04-14 18:32:00,8333,"The more you type the more wrong you are. How was Kardi's hit illegal?  How about Anderson's butt end on Henrique? How is this not illegal?  And remember, I don't need any more manure for my garden this year.  "
779694,Jigger,2013-04-14 19:45:00,1237,"Other teams not taking the Leafs seriously= more wins for the Leafs. I have no problem with that. You not taking the Leafs seriously? Pot, meet kettle..."
779798,jedimaster,2013-04-15 05:19:00,3472,Shoulder to shoulder puck was only a few inches off his stick. Great hit. Can hardly wait for the playoffs. Btw what exactly have the sens done in the last 48 year? I mean other than lose every play off series to the leafs.
779885,tb4me,2013-04-15 17:00:00,3295,Thats funny..Illeagl and marked man you say eh..Why dont you send another Sen to try to teach the Leafs the way..Im sure Mclearen would love the chance to send another one the Sens away for a few months...
779904,davey buoy,2013-04-15 18:31:00,5505,"Matt you sure it hasn't been looked over.?I think it was a good hit,too close to call, IMO."
779906,BillM,2013-04-15 18:48:00,17367,I'd love to hear the explanation on how that hit was 'illegal'...
779963,muskymatt,2013-04-15 21:23:00,2608,"3 strides( charging), hand(punch) and elbow up, hit in the head area, 2' from the boards. But, that said, every laff fan will see the exact opposite no doubt!"
779965,davey buoy,2013-04-15 21:28:00,5505,"There will be plenty more of where that came from.Heads up ! lol. No suspension? This is fun for us!!,been a while  lol.!!!!!!!!!"
779966,kickingfrog,2013-04-15 21:29:00,8333,"No comment on the butt end eh?  So Kadri hand punched, and elbowed him? Boy, Shanahan is going to ring him up for the rest of the season for sure."
779967,muskymatt,2013-04-15 21:30:00,2608, That butt end was totally clean!!
779970,Roy,2013-04-15 21:41:00,13728,Ottawa is not playing tonight anyhow....nor is Boston of course.
779975,BillM,2013-04-15 22:39:00,17367," You gotta stop drinking before you watch TV, lol."
779986,kickingfrog,2013-04-15 22:58:00,8333,"A butt ending penalty, just like a high stick, is not based on intent. We all know Anderson intended to butt end the guy in the face, but even if he didn't, it is still a penalty. But all is cool, you've never let the facts, or logic, get in the way. Enjoy the off season."
779994,jedimaster,2013-04-15 23:21:00,3472,Anyone have a stream working for the game tonight?
778701,tb4me,2013-04-10 03:50:00,3295,How bout those Sens! 5 in a row..Go leafs Go!
778708,solopaddler,2013-04-10 09:25:00,8605,If they can eke out a win tonight against a desperate Rangers team Saturdays game will be huge.
778756,jedimaster,2013-04-10 13:10:00,3472,The leafs have 2 games against Montreal remaining. A sweep of those would be awesome. imagine a Montreal/Toronto first round?
778801,muskymatt,2013-04-10 15:31:00,2608,"Yeah the Sens are on hard times these days, which brings me to have to ask a favor of the Laff fans.  Here is my question:  When your team sucks and I mean is really playing bad, so bad it's hard to watch. How do you keep positive? I'm asking the laff fans because they have more experience at this than any other team in any sport period.  Thanks in advance for your suggestions!"
778802,BillM,2013-04-10 15:34:00,17367,Don't you have enough experience with those fantastic playoff runs the Sens have made?  Should be used to it by now
778807,DRIFTER_016,2013-04-10 15:49:00,10439,"That's just short term disappointment Bill. It's at the end of the season and Sens fans forget quickly over the summer months. Leaf fans have endured a lot more heartbreak over the years, which has toughened us up. Years of disappointment followed by glimpses of greatness really give us the ability to be positive and believe we can again regain the glory of past successes. The Sens have no past successes!!! Therefore they have no hope!!!! They are soft, choke artists and their poor misguided fans know this."
778812,jedimaster,2013-04-10 17:08:00,3472,I am pretty sure I mentioned a week ago this road rip will break the sens. They are a horrible road team. still 3 more losses to look forward to matt... Better hope you aren't looking at a bunch of blue in front of you.
778880,DRIFTER_016,2013-04-10 23:18:00,10439,Good one from Greg @ EDGE 102 
778904,jedimaster,2013-04-11 01:37:00,3472,"Haha, good game against the rangers against tonight. Going to overtime. A couple slow times through the game."
778924,BillM,2013-04-11 02:59:00,17367,I'll gladly take that point!  Kadri could have finished it however!!!
778930,jedimaster,2013-04-11 03:29:00,3472,Yep and the best part is a win by Winnipeg over florida tomorrow and a loss by the sens to phil (awesome at home this year) puts the sens out of a playoff spot. I might even watch a sens game on purpose. Haha
778973,tb4me,2013-04-11 14:01:00,3295,Go Jets and Florida Go!... lol
778984,Jigger,2013-04-11 14:45:00,1237,"As much as i dislike The Sens, id like to see all the Canadian teams in the playoffs. Obviously, Calgary is exempt..."
778994,jedimaster,2013-04-11 15:55:00,3472,I would really like to see the jets in the playoffs.
778996,BillM,2013-04-11 16:06:00,17367," Agreed, the more Canadian teams in the playoffs the better."
779001,DRIFTER_016,2013-04-11 16:20:00,10439,"Although there does need to be some US teams in the playoffs for the health of the league. But yeah, mo Canucks is never a bad thing."
779029,jedimaster,2013-04-11 18:03:00,3472,I think Bettman would actually die if it was ever an all Canadian cup final. or even worse an all Canadian conference finals.
779381,Roy,2013-04-13 00:51:00,13728,Nice to see Ottawa taking this one....so far....
779393,muskymatt,2013-04-13 01:42:00,2608, Win and 2 more points for the SENS(PRAISE ALFIE) woooohooooo...... didn't look great doing it but we'll take it.
779544,tb4me,2013-04-13 23:28:00,3295,"1-0 Leafs VS Habs, Go Leafs Go! Its Sat night!! Oh Yeah.."
779545,Nipfisher,2013-04-13 23:30:00,2449,
779547,davey buoy,2013-04-13 23:40:00,5505,3-0 now!!!!!!!!!!!!!Yes! lol.
779548,tb4me,2013-04-13 23:41:00,3295,3-0 Price yanked.. lol its going to be a long game..
779552,Nipfisher,2013-04-13 23:56:00,2449,1 shot 1 goal on Budaj.
779553,Jigger,2013-04-13 23:58:00,1237,Leafs have an 80% shooting percentage.
777727,muskymatt,2013-04-05 15:56:00,2608,I thought it was a good hit actually!! How do you like my new avatar  GO PHILLY GO  Favorite team # 22
777732,jedimaster,2013-04-05 16:59:00,3472,Typical of sens fans... from behind and all.
778019,danc,2013-04-07 00:52:00,4677,WTH guys? It's Saturday night!
778022,chris.brock,2013-04-07 00:59:00,4053,"pretty dry game, I just hope they get the 2 points even though they don't deserve it (1-0 leafs after 2)  edit  yep, 2 points, very cool, they were shelled in the 1st and 2nd though  10 games left, we're in good shape"
778036,tb4me,2013-04-07 03:28:00,3295,Yes Good game.. Reimer saefly stole one for us..Leafs win Sens loose..Its a good day..
778038,Roy,2013-04-07 03:50:00,13728,"Montreal did well against their nemesis. And Toronto did decently against Joisey... I'm happy with that. Chicago, Pittsburgh, Anaheim and Boston are not easy to play against if we ever get there."
778179,jedimaster,2013-04-07 23:22:00,3472,"Well, looks like everythign is clear for me to go to the game tomorrow night... I'll be the guy in the kadri jersey holding up a sign that says ""It could be worse.. I could be a Sens Fan!!!"""
778197,tb4me,2013-04-08 00:39:00,3295,Cool have fun!
778277,muskymatt,2013-04-08 15:28:00,2608,"The Sens are behaving more like the laffs these days, hopefully they'll shake it off.  Kadri is a flash in the pan, he'll be behaving more like a laff sooner than you can blink, its inevitable."
778283,BillM,2013-04-08 16:02:00,17367,You can tell Carlyle is trying to keep Kadri grounded... Exactly what the kids needs..  Hoping for a good effort tonight against the Rangers!
778290,bigugli,2013-04-08 17:24:00,6138,"I'm still waiting for the Leafs to play a consistent 3 periods of hockey, else they can't last long in the playoffs. Reimer can only do so much."
778291,jedimaster,2013-04-08 17:29:00,3472,"Yep, I'll see if I can post some pics along the way... unless they start to get bombed. haha"
778347,jedimaster,2013-04-08 23:50:00,3472,Great game so far... rangers look like they are sleeping. 
778349,Roy,2013-04-08 23:59:00,13728,Wow! Look at the empty seats in there!
778351,BillM,2013-04-09 00:06:00,17367,"Roy, everyone I'm sure is at the beer counter  :)"
778352,Rod Caster,2013-04-09 00:07:00,5784,It's fairly empty mid-game as well. It must have been a bearish day on Bay street today.
778364,jedimaster,2013-04-09 00:54:00,3472,During the game 95 percent of the seats are full. I have some cool pictures will upload tomorrow. Voice is almost gone. What's with the horrible refs.
778366,jedimaster,2013-04-09 00:54:00,3472,That shot of the skate around was the warm up.
778445,jedimaster,2013-04-09 12:57:00,3472,"Comparing the jagr and iginla trade....  Jagr: Recorded over 600 assists in Pittsburgh, thanks to his uncanny ability to always feed the puck to the Penguins' best players.  Iginla: Must have a similar talent, since he was only in Pittsburgh for one period before the Penguin's best player was fed a hockey puck."
778541,davey buoy,2013-04-09 18:54:00,5505,"Roy if it looks somewhat empty,as said,there probably at the bar!.Season tickets are sold out for most if not the whole season."
778617,BillM,2013-04-09 22:54:00,17367,All of the Leaf games at home are sold out.  It's the richest franchise in the NHL.
778627,Roy,2013-04-09 23:19:00,13728,I know they're always sold out but you'd think a few more people would want to see them playing?
778694,kickingfrog,2013-04-10 02:40:00,8333,Anybody else hear that beeping sound?
778695,solopaddler,2013-04-10 02:53:00,8605," No, but I'm smelling burnt toast.  Why?"
778697,kickingfrog,2013-04-10 02:56:00,8333,Come on!  Someone's backing up.
777454,jedimaster,2013-04-04 00:12:00,3472,That looks like the Sens top line.
777503,DRIFTER_016,2013-04-04 05:04:00,10439," Nope, but this is!!! Alfie's the whiny one in the middle!!!  "
777618,chris.brock,2013-04-04 23:59:00,4053,"I miss Mike Brown in a game like this (PHI, end of the 1st), it's hard to quantify, but I think the Leafs fighting/ hitting has contributed to their success  it's probably coincidence, but the Oilers are on fire"
777619,tb4me,2013-04-05 00:02:00,3295,Holy crap Lupes is most likely concussed..This is where im a firm beliver in an eye for an eye..Schenn and Girux are both lucky I dont play for the Leafs tonight...Just syain..Go after our stars yours are next..Im ticked..Clearly head hunting there..
777622,BillM,2013-04-05 00:16:00,17367,That 4 day layoff didn't seem to help anything.  Let's hope Lupul is ok...   Rosehill or whatever his name is was definitely on the hunt with that hit.
777624,danc,2013-04-05 00:21:00,4677, 5 day
777625,tb4me,2013-04-05 00:22:00,3295,Lupal wont return upper body injury..Gaurenteed he is concussed the way he staggered off the ice..
777628,chris.brock,2013-04-05 00:25:00,4053," I'm a Leaf fan, but I don't think Rosehill was doing anything wrong, just trying to make a hit, it was a pin-ball effect  I'd still like to see McLaren break Jay's face"
777629,danc,2013-04-05 00:26:00,4677, Gotta agree with you there Chris.
777631,tb4me,2013-04-05 00:34:00,3295,"I dont agree at all, Rosie was going for his numbers, thats called a blind side hit"
777632,DRIFTER_016,2013-04-05 00:35:00,10439,That goal was totally bogus!!!
777633,Dan668,2013-04-05 00:35:00,1120,"Bad hit, terrible reffing in general"
777637,danc,2013-04-05 00:43:00,4677," And that happens 20 times every game. If not for the other Philly guy hitting him a split second before that, it would just be another routine hit and Lupul would have 2 goals by now."
777638,jedimaster,2013-04-05 00:45:00,3472,"Clearly a hit from behind. The refs have been horrible. the tripping call missed, the goalie interference, hits from behind. Brutal. The leafs haven't played great, and Kulemin had a horrible giveaway but the leafs better get it back together and beat some serious ass if they are gonna lose this one. Someone from philly must hit the ice HARD."
777641,Roy,2013-04-05 00:54:00,13728, HAHAHAHAHAHA
777642,danc,2013-04-05 00:56:00,4677, 
777643,DRIFTER_016,2013-04-05 00:56:00,10439,I wanna see Simonds spittin' chicklets all over the ice. I hate that guy!!!
777652,tb4me,2013-04-05 01:18:00,3295,
777656,Dan668,2013-04-05 01:34:00,1120,Yep. Ruins the game.
777658,tb4me,2013-04-05 01:45:00,3295,There is no doubt in my mind the refs took this game from us tonight...rotten !@#$%^
777663,BillM,2013-04-05 02:08:00,17367,"We played like crap, bad refs or not...."
777664,danc,2013-04-05 02:14:00,4677, And there you have it. We lost. You guys blaming the Lupul hit or the refs need to take off your rose colored glasses and move on. No excuses from my seat either Bill.
777668,DRIFTER_016,2013-04-05 02:53:00,10439,After 5 days off I expected them to play the way they did. Hopefully they are angry now and take it out on the Devils on Saturday.
777705,BillM,2013-04-05 13:10:00,17367,I hate those long layoffs...  You lose any/all momentum you had... I like the Leafs when they are hungry.   Lastnight they were not.
777726,davey buoy,2013-04-05 15:46:00,5505,"You could see that,looked like Lupol took the wind out of them when it shouldn't have"
777013,DRIFTER_016,2013-04-02 01:05:00,10439,Broke my jaw when I was a kid. Didn't have to have it wired shut either. Broke one tooth which needed a cap so not nearly as bad as spitting chicklets all over the ice. Was out and being a kid again in two or 3 weeks.
777088,jedimaster,2013-04-02 14:31:00,3472,"I heard Bozak, Riemer and a Pick for Schnieder"
777185,Nipfisher,2013-04-02 18:48:00,2449,Jager to the Bruins. Yikes.
777186,davey buoy,2013-04-02 18:49:00,5505,"What about Kiprosoff?,I heard he is now a leaf!,38 years old?,what do you guys think!!"
777187,Christopheraaron,2013-04-02 18:58:00,3525,So do we talk about baseball on here now?
777202,davey buoy,2013-04-02 19:25:00,5505,"Maybe Christopher,lol."
777214,bigugli,2013-04-02 19:54:00,6138,"Played goal before masks were mandatory. Used to think Plante was a pussy for wearing a mask. Got me a concussion and a few stitches for my efforts. Butt end of a stick in the teeth. You shook it off and were back on the ice next week, albeit the parents made sure I had a mask after those mishaps. A broken jaw is going to take more than a week to get over, even if it wasn't wired"
777228,jedimaster,2013-04-02 20:27:00,3472,"I haven't seen that report yet, I heard that Nonis was given permission to talk to him, but I also recall Kipper saying he won't report to any team if traded.  Jagr to the Bruins is an interesting move though. "
777230,davey buoy,2013-04-02 20:33:00,5505,"Heard that two times this morning,I guess we'll hear for sure very soon."
777240,Rod Caster,2013-04-02 20:57:00,5784,Eastern conference playoffs will be very interesting this year!
777241,jedimaster,2013-04-02 20:58:00,3472,"yep, I am all for getting a veteran goalie for the play-offs as long as we don't need to give much up. If we could get someone vet number 2 in exchange for one of our's plus say bozak or grabovski. I would be in for that, LA and Vancouver both have excellent number 2's better than either of ours."
777248,Rod Caster,2013-04-02 21:09:00,5784,"Toronto won't get a goalie... they'll get chewed up too bad when they get booted out the first round, are minus a first round pick only to have a goalie with a meaningless contract. They have to have confidence in their guys right now and re-tune next year. They look much better now then they have for years....don't mess it up and lose a high pick.  Go Jets!"
777254,jedimaster,2013-04-02 21:32:00,3472,I don't think anyone wants to lose a high pick unless its for a really soilid goalie. Kipper isn't one I would give up the farm for.
777259,misfish,2013-04-02 21:37:00,29133," Guess you missed my point. It was meant ,what a puck can do.  As for Kip. NO NO NO"
777279,tb4me,2013-04-02 23:09:00,3295,KIpper to Toronto is bad news..The dude has a worse record then Reimer this year..Ill be pissed if this happens..I wouldnt give up a bag of pucks for the guy
777283,davey buoy,2013-04-02 23:13:00,5505,"I'm not overly excited either. 38 years of age,how much more coud he possibly have.?"
777293,jedimaster,2013-04-03 00:13:00,3472,"If you don't have to give up anything for him, its a good move imo. He has playoff experience and will add some safety if one of the current guys goes down or goes cold. Even if he just sits in the locker room its a worthwhile move. Of course it depends on what they give up for him. He has been battling a nagging knee injury all season, has had good stats for his entire NHL career outside of this one. I am not saying he is a savior but he is a good goalie. Something happened this year in Calgary. Enough for one of the best in the league want to GTFO asap. He doesn't have much left in the tank, maybe a year or two more."
777299,Jigger,2013-04-03 00:52:00,1237,"Kiprusoff is an All-World goalie. Hes won playoff rounds all by himself and IMO should be wearing a SC ring. His stats this year dont reflect the kind of netminder he is. Btw, hes 36 and has one more year on his contract. Word is it would take a 3rd. All this is moot if, like many said, he doesnt report to the team hes traded to."
777306,Rod Caster,2013-04-03 01:05:00,5784,Good trade for a third and a prospect. I wouldn't go higher than that.
777308,jedimaster,2013-04-03 01:16:00,3472,I would drop a third and a prospect on him any day of the week.
777427,DRIFTER_016,2013-04-03 21:23:00,10439,Nonis made a deal. Another tough D-Man for a 4th round pick. Good trade in my opinion!!  :good:  http://mapleleafs.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=663916 
777429,tb4me,2013-04-03 21:37:00,3295,"I like this move! I'm happy to say this, the leafs just got a whole lot tougher! "
777442,BillM,2013-04-03 22:24:00,17367,"6'5, 230lb d-man...   Sounds good to me!!!"
777444,jedimaster,2013-04-03 22:44:00,3472,I like tough.
777445,DRIFTER_016,2013-04-03 22:48:00,10439,As is evidenced by your excellent choice of avitars. This would be your avitar otherwise!!  
776511,jedimaster,2013-03-31 00:10:00,3472,Good on anderson for stepping up for a rematch. Too bad sally couldn't bring it and got put down again.
776523,danc,2013-03-31 01:22:00,4677,Am I the only one watching the Lupul/Kadri show? Wow!!
776524,DRIFTER_016,2013-03-31 01:22:00,10439,KADRI with the hat trick!!!!!
776525,danc,2013-03-31 01:27:00,4677,He's starting to make a habit of that.
776526,jedimaster,2013-03-31 01:29:00,3472,I can hardly watch the leafs are playing so good. Go Leafs Go!!!
776527,tb4me,2013-03-31 01:33:00,3295,What a game. Kadri with the trick. Sens showed they are a great AHL team tonight Go Leafs Go!!!!
776528,danc,2013-03-31 01:39:00,4677,Ouch...  But I like it!!
776531,tb4me,2013-03-31 01:54:00,3295,Wow Reimer with the no no and Kadri with the trick. Sens showed up in AHL jerseys tonight.
776532,DRIFTER_016,2013-03-31 01:58:00,10439,Check out all of the Sens fan in this pic from tonight's game in Ottawa. Must be Matt at the game.  
776537,muskymatt,2013-03-31 02:23:00,2608,   Good one! Lupul and Kadri deserved that win. Can't argue that
776539,DRIFTER_016,2013-03-31 02:30:00,10439, At least you're smiling in the pic and have a cold beer in your hand Matt.
776541,DRIFTER_016,2013-03-31 02:31:00,10439,"On another note, the Canucks are getting shelled by the Oilers!! 7:53 into the game and Taylor Hall already has a hat trick and the Oilers are up 4-0."
776543,tb4me,2013-03-31 02:56:00,3295,Here's some interesting stats..Reimer is 5-0-0 carear in Ottawa. Has allowed 4 goals in total.. Lupal is shooting a 40% clip this month. 8 goals on 20 shots..amazing.. What a great time to come together as a team and start winning games..Im a proud leafer tonight
776885,jedimaster,2013-04-01 17:45:00,3472,What a trade over the Weekend. Iginla for Crosby...
776887,BillM,2013-04-01 17:50:00,17367, LOL!!!!
776896,jedimaster,2013-04-01 18:44:00,3472,"Pretty sure Iginla said in his press release ""He was excited to play with the best player in the league""... yah for all of 55 seconds.. Last time I checked broken jaw is 3.5-8 weeks. typically 6-8 weeks, then it back with a full mask. 6 weeks puts it as a return for the end of the first or begining of the second round. Wonder if the Pens will still be in it by then."
776898,Steve,2013-04-01 18:47:00,2075,"crosby is made of glass.  if the injury is 6-8 weeks, he'll take 10 to recover."
776910,BillM,2013-04-01 19:23:00,17367, I'm sure you would have taken a puck off the face much better then he did.
776919,davey buoy,2013-04-01 19:46:00,5505,"Your right Bill,he's the best player for a while now,I'm sure there not going to risk bringing him back if they don't need him. He's young and the franchise!!!!!!!"
776934,jedimaster,2013-04-01 20:33:00,3472,A hockey puck is pretty hard... especially when moving at 100 mph.  I think I would cry If I caught it in the kisser.
776941,misfish,2013-04-01 20:44:00,29133,"I have seen what a puck can do,to my sons goalie mask. Had a 1 inch dent. Thank god for the cage.. Funny how the kids have to play under rules,but when we/they,get older,it not so."
776959,tb4me,2013-04-01 22:17:00,3295,"Good news as far as Crosby is concerned.. He is still in Hospital but the jaw isn't wired shut so recovery wont be all that long...He is undergoing extensive dental surgery.. Over 8 hours in the OR already..Poor jerk, I heard this on TSN radio today at noon.lol how is s o b not allowed but changed to jerk? Just for the record I dont think he is a jerk..lol"
776961,davey buoy,2013-04-01 22:30:00,5505,"Good to hear,hope he is back soon!"
776967,John Bacon,2013-04-01 22:54:00,3277," Yeah, if I was an owner I would want my players wearing masks.  In what other occupation is proper safety equipment and option?"
776980,Jigger,2013-04-01 23:31:00,1237,Lots of talk between the Leafs and the Flames about Kiprusoff. All over twitter
776163,davey buoy,2013-03-28 23:34:00,5505,"You hate to speak to soon,but Carolina looks terrible so far!"
776166,davey buoy,2013-03-28 23:47:00,5505,Peters is seeing everything!!!Toronto could of been way a head. Let's see if the leafs can hold a 1-0 lead into the second.
776167,tb4me,2013-03-28 23:52:00,3295,Go Leafs Go!  This game easily could have been 4 or 5-0 by the end of the 1st
776193,DRIFTER_016,2013-03-29 01:29:00,10439,What a sweet goal by Lupul!!!!
776195,tb4me,2013-03-29 01:30:00,3295,HOLY CRAP Lupal does it all by himself...What a game!
776197,grizzlybri,2013-03-29 01:33:00,565,"  All in favor, I was excited when the leafs first traded for him because I've followed him since he was a duck."
776200,muskymatt,2013-03-29 01:40:00,2608,"Crap! More ammo for the laffites, this is not good!"
776201,BillM,2013-03-29 01:41:00,17367,"Great comeback tonight, such an awesome PP!!!!"
776202,danc,2013-03-29 01:42:00,4677, Yup. Play of the night for sure.
776204,muskymatt,2013-03-29 01:47:00,2608,"As much as I hate to say it, they are playing some good hockey.  But they still suck"
776205,tb4me,2013-03-29 01:53:00,3295,"LOL funny Matt.. Hope those Sens loose tonight..If they do and we can beat them Sat night that would put us 2 points up on them in 5th...Go Leafs Go!  Edit, scratch that Sens won-3-0"
776393,muskymatt,2013-03-30 15:03:00,2608,It's on boys!!!!  Tonight's the night.
776403,DRIFTER_016,2013-03-30 16:04:00,10439,Should be a great one!!!! GO LEAFS GO!!!!! PRAISE LUPES!!!! PRAISE KADRI!!!!!
776405,jedimaster,2013-03-30 16:15:00,3472,I heard alfredson is a healthy scratch... looks like he is on the block to be traded. Sorry musky matt
776406,jedimaster,2013-03-30 16:16:00,3472,Haha jk... I am all phsyched up for this game.but to tell you the truth I would rather hold onto 6th spot. I would much rather have a first round against Winnipeg.
776407,DRIFTER_016,2013-03-30 16:20:00,10439, Ain't that the truth!!!
776408,tb4me,2013-03-30 16:22:00,3295,"in the words of Si Robertson, ""Its on like Donkey Kong Jack!"" Go Leafs Go!"
776418,tb4me,2013-03-30 17:09:00,3295,Kaberle placed on waivers...hmmm Should Nunas pick him up?
776422,Sebastian,2013-03-30 17:36:00,208,Lets swap Komisarek for Kaberle!! Almost the same salary.
776427,davey buoy,2013-03-30 18:10:00,5505,Don't we only take players back when there out of there prime!!!!  . lol.
776474,DRIFTER_016,2013-03-30 21:05:00,10439,DANG!!! Just saw video of Sid the kid taking a slapshot right in the chops today!!!! Looks like it may leave a mark. Wonder if he looks like Bobby Clark now.  http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=662917&print=true
776479,muskymatt,2013-03-30 21:27:00,2608," Knocked out some teeth,,,,ouch! At least no eye injuries"
776500,davey buoy,2013-03-30 23:20:00,5505,"Alfie's playing,wonder what's up with that?  They weren't ""praising Alfie"" after that goal while he was in the penalty box."
776501,danc,2013-03-30 23:29:00,4677, LOL
776505,DRIFTER_016,2013-03-30 23:49:00,10439,HAHAHA!!! Mclaren was showing off his title belt on the way to the box!!!
775333,glen,2013-03-23 23:40:00,2641,I can't remember cause I ain't that old.
775334,DRIFTER_016,2013-03-23 23:46:00,10439, Almost exactly 2 years ago.
775335,jedimaster,2013-03-23 23:46:00,3472,2 years ago almost to the day. Reimer was in net before his first injury.
775336,davey buoy,2013-03-23 23:57:00,5505,I thought it might of been longer. Were overdue anyways. Heavy pressure by Bosten the last few minutes whew!!!
775338,tb4me,2013-03-24 00:20:00,3295,Grabo nets a beauty shot..Didnt see that comming
775339,danc,2013-03-24 00:29:00,4677,"Yup. And I was there. 5, 2 Leafs.  "
775342,jedimaster,2013-03-24 00:38:00,3472,PLaying good so far. Competing well.
775347,jedimaster,2013-03-24 01:47:00,3472,What a squeaker. Dion saved one at the end.great game from the leafs.
775349,DRIFTER_016,2013-03-24 01:51:00,10439,Be sweet if we could repeat Monday.
775354,tb4me,2013-03-24 02:22:00,3295,Great game.. Wierd but great..Torontos Defence was well tonight but so was Bostons.Leafs managed to win 3-2 on only 13 shots..
775613,tb4me,2013-03-25 23:34:00,3295,"Go Leafs Go, lets drop the hammer boys!"
775615,jedimaster,2013-03-25 23:48:00,3472,"Goo first period. They look like they have some life in them. Lets hope they keep it up. ""If it bleeds it can be killed"""
775622,jedimaster,2013-03-26 00:21:00,3472,Great feed by kadri. Nice finish from kuleman. Great second period keep it up bruins on there heels.
775630,bigugli,2013-03-26 01:00:00,6138,"Too  many risky mistakes by Gardiner. Reimer is doing great, but he can't keep making up for the defence."
775638,Jigger,2013-03-26 01:31:00,1237,Hasnt been his best game defensively. But his feed to Lupul was awesome.
775640,knightfisher,2013-03-26 01:43:00,237,Leafs will get at least three of four points in the last two games.  Nuff said.  Go leafs....
775642,jedimaster,2013-03-26 01:49:00,3472,"Yep, happy with that but so sloppy in the overtime. Keep kessle on the bench he is floating."
775647,DRIFTER_016,2013-03-26 01:59:00,10439,DANG!!! Reimer got deeked right out of his equipment on that second goal in the shootout.  Happy with 3 out of 4 points against the Bruins though.
775648,BillM,2013-03-26 02:09:00,17367, They played better in the OT then they did the 3rd period.
775756,tb4me,2013-03-26 21:10:00,3295,Great game! 3 out of a possible 4 points against Boston ill take it any day.. Florida tonight..Go Leafs Go! 15 games in 3 weeks ..Hold on to your hats Leaf fans!
775758,davey buoy,2013-03-26 21:12:00,5505,"How do you think the leafs will fare against Florida?,I think the boys in blue may be a bit tired.I hope I'm wrong."
775772,muskymatt,2013-03-26 21:58:00,2608,"Laffs should do just fine against Florida , they aren't tired and they have loads of skill. That's why they have been tearing it up since 1967  Bwahaha  How's your last 10 record doing now laffites?  Same old same old eh!!!!!  LoL"
775833,knightfisher,2013-03-27 02:35:00,237,Good job by the leafs to get two more points.  Leafs don't need a goalie.  Defence needs help.  Can't be allowing so many shots per game.  Also need a new captain.  Nice to see the Jets win as well.   
775836,BillM,2013-03-27 02:37:00,17367,Lupul should have the C next season.
775849,davey buoy,2013-03-27 08:11:00,5505,"Agreed,that would be a better choice!"
774806,jedimaster,2013-03-20 19:09:00,3472,Komisarik placed on waivers today... too bad gunarsun didn't join him.
774835,glen,2013-03-20 20:48:00,2641,Keep laughing the leafs have the better team and if they ever show up you will lose.
774839,Jigger,2013-03-20 20:57:00,1237,Feel bad for the guy. His best seasons were playing with Markov who plays pretty well the same game as Phaneuf. In his prime i think he wouldve slid in beside Dion just fine. He was never the same after Lucic took him to the cleaners...
774857,muskymatt,2013-03-20 22:04:00,2608," ugh, me likes computer!!  Sen guy win.  Laff guy  lose.  Homer happy!!!  "
774860,BillM,2013-03-20 22:14:00,17367,"Matt, all your players are dropping like flies!"
774879,nancur373,2013-03-20 23:45:00,1211,Are you serious???? Phaneuf is not even close to the defenceman Markov is....
774885,DRIFTER_016,2013-03-21 00:17:00,10439,HOLY MACKINAW!!!!!
774889,muskymatt,2013-03-21 00:25:00,2608," That's more like a herd of flies, amazing, but even more amazing that they keep winning.  Who would have guessed that? Almost afraid to get the regs back for fear they'll upset the chemistry."
774893,BillM,2013-03-21 00:43:00,17367," I can't believe the Sens record with all the players they've got injured, I gotta admit it's pretty awesome."
774906,Jigger,2013-03-21 01:29:00,1237,"You're right. He only plays teams top lines, scored 88pts the past 2 seasons and has only 6 less pts this season than Markov has in TOTAL over the past 2 seasons. Sorry, 15pts if you include this season for Markov. Hes made of glass, after all. Where is he so much of an ugrade again?"
774910,bigugli,2013-03-21 02:06:00,6138,"Laffs didn't do too bad tonight, but they are still a 2 period team."
774913,Dan668,2013-03-21 02:18:00,1120,They have a game tomorrow. Why waste energy.
774915,jedimaster,2013-03-21 02:31:00,3472,One down one to go. These are the most important games of the season. If they win tomorrow they are in good shape to weather the next two games against boston.
775083,misfish,2013-03-21 23:29:00,29133,"Nasty start,but,GOALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL"
775084,misfish,2013-03-21 23:32:00,29133,"AGAIN,GOALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL MY GAWD"
775085,glen,2013-03-21 23:36:00,2641,Good show eh.  Keep head up or it may get taken off.
775087,chris.brock,2013-03-21 23:57:00,4053,Pussy cat Kaleta's head likely isn't feeling all that great after Orr smashed him 3 times (check in out later on hockeyfights.com if you missed the footage right before the intermision)
775113,darsky,2013-03-22 02:16:00,586,..........................is the Canadians' rcord since getting beaten at home by the Maple Leafs 6-0 .  I'll take that loss anytime if it means a streak like that. Just padding on those points !
775117,jedimaster,2013-03-22 02:46:00,3472,I'll take wins against montreal any day of the week.
775279,nancur373,2013-03-23 03:49:00,1211,When was the last time Phaneuf was on the top PK unit. And he's a deadbeat as a PP quarterback. I'm not just saying this because I'm  a Habs fan. If a leaf player does good I'll give credit. But Phaneuf is a plug. Also...how's Komisarek these days? Tell him thanks for not signing with us for half of what he got from you guys.   ....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................shhh...let's hope he don't bring up Kaberle....
775325,tb4me,2013-03-23 22:56:00,3295,"Wouldnt be a Sat night with out a Gool Ol ""Go Leafs Go"" come on boys lets beat those pesky Bruins.."
775326,davey buoy,2013-03-23 23:02:00,5505,"Just saw the two heavy weights having a word from each side of centre ice.Here we go!!!!,maybe."
775329,davey buoy,2013-03-23 23:29:00,5505,Well that took 5 min lol..Way to go ORR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
775330,glen,2013-03-23 23:30:00,2641,We got them now.
775332,davey buoy,2013-03-23 23:33:00,5505,"We really need a win against this team!,When was the last time the leafs beat them?"
774276,muskymatt,2013-03-18 00:06:00,2608,"Geese, did the Sens(PRAISE ALFIE) win again????  What's that now? 5 losses  in a row for the laffs? Points in their last 5 for the Sens(PRAISE ALFIE) including 2 wins and  beating a team the laffs just lost to!!  4 points up on the laffs and that with a depleted lineup.  Laffs are sinking fast.  GO SENS GO (PRAISE ALFIE)"
774280,BillM,2013-03-18 00:28:00,17367,"Win again?  You've lost 6 out of the last 8...   Keep that winning streak going, lol."
774286,glen,2013-03-18 01:10:00,2641,You can see who Carlyle likes from the picks in the shootout. It's a wonder he didn't have gunnerson try. I was keeping track of how many times gunnerson gives the puck away and It was six times in a row in the 2nd. I would trade him for a pylon. I would play komiserick instead of gunnerson.
774296,BillM,2013-03-18 01:43:00,17367,"I was yelling at the TV for Carlyle to bench Gunnerson..  What a waste of space that kid is, it's like he's got zero hockey sense at all.."
774300,glen,2013-03-18 02:04:00,2641,I have been thinking that for a long time. Why do they keep playing him?
774302,BillM,2013-03-18 02:05:00,17367,I can't believe he got ice time after those giveaways...    Carlyle has benched other players for less.
774307,glen,2013-03-18 02:19:00,2641,It shows you that there is some hidden Bull that controls what happens on the team. Whoever is making the decisions is crazy. Is it that monkey that used to pick winning teams controlling the leafs?
774315,dhickey,2013-03-18 02:46:00,1038,???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? I think thats about enough.................................................
774363,jedimaster,2013-03-18 15:25:00,3472,"I thin kwe are at that point in the year where the mid season scedule is critical. The leafs have Buffalo and Tampa back to back then they play boston twice in a row. The leafs can't afford to drop the next two and need these wins. There will be 15 games left after these next 4 and fortuately none more against boston. If the leafs can win 2 of the next 4 I would be very optimistic. If they drop 3 of the next 4 I think its going to look grim. After these 4, they play 11 games against teams below them in the standings. They shold be able to play .500 and still make the playoffs. The games against Phili, Islanders, rangers and tampa are most critical. Those are the temas lookin up at the leafs gunning for a play off spot."
774374,glen,2013-03-18 16:03:00,2641,So you are saying they are in the playoffs? I hope they start to play hockey or the Boston games are going to be a gongs how again.
774471,jedimaster,2013-03-19 02:32:00,3472,"Hell no, but if they drop these two to coming up against tampa and buffalo that back to back against boston will be the end of the season if they don't win. 500 over the next 4 puts keeps them in a good spot to be buyers fo the deadline. 4 losses and they are gonna consider selling."
774476,BillM,2013-03-19 02:47:00,17367,They gotta get the next 2 against those lower ranked teams before they go to Boston..
774584,davey buoy,2013-03-19 18:46:00,5505,"Leafs are on a slide,granted two games they played well.I don't like what I'm seeing now.I sure hope they turn it around."
774608,tb4me,2013-03-19 22:02:00,3295,"Holzer sent down Gardiner brought back up! With Steckell gone we have both roster room and some money to spend..Who does Nunas go after? Louongo, Bobby Ryan? Any thoughts?"
774623,jedimaster,2013-03-19 23:07:00,3472,"He is waiting to see if he sells or buys. If he buys and gets anything other than a goalie or a center he wasted money. Its clear this is what the leafs need to everyone with eyes. I heard an interesting rumour that ovechkin may be on the block to be traded in the summer and coul dbe had for a bag of pucks if anyone is willing to eat that enormous contract. If the leafs go for a goalie, I wold think Miller, Luongo and Brizgeloff could all be on the block."
774635,tb4me,2013-03-19 23:34:00,3295,As much as I like oven chicken there is no way any sane GM takes that hefty contract on ..7 years at 10 mill..70 mill for an averave player at best (last 2 years) is way to much.. Lots of 30 goal scorers for way less  Bobby Ryan being one of them.. KYper was saying that a Grabo and a pick may be in play for Louongo. Come on April 3rd!
774639,glen,2013-03-19 23:51:00,2641,I'll take a center over a goalie.  Get dion a partner while we're at it.
774650,tb4me,2013-03-20 00:57:00,3295,His partner has arrived in Jake Gardiner
774668,muskymatt,2013-03-20 01:41:00,2608,"Oh yeah baby!!!!!!!! Come back kids, awesome win, 38 points for the SENS (PRAISE ALFIE).........  WHAT A TEAM!!!!!!"
774699,Walleye'm Fishing,2013-03-20 03:24:00,310,"Man our team is unbelievable Matt. I've never loved the Sens this much, you just gotta admire the fact that they refuse to die. That Methot injury didn't look good though...   Fingers crossed."
774754,Jigger,2013-03-20 15:14:00,1237,Theres more of you?
774762,Walleye'm Fishing,2013-03-20 15:49:00,310,"  Probably not any more one here. However, this is after all an Ontario forum, not exclusively a Toronto one. Where are you Sens fans? Or... are Matt and I the only ones on this site?"
774764,BillM,2013-03-20 15:58:00,17367,Looking forward to seeing Gardiner in action tonight!!!
774787,jedimaster,2013-03-20 17:24:00,3472,  Possibly the only ones that are able to type on a computer....
774804,Walleye'm Fishing,2013-03-20 19:03:00,310,"Again,  The most important thing Leaf fans can have is a sense of humour..."
773739,muskymatt,2013-03-14 17:47:00,2608,"Penguins not Sens (PRAISE ALFIE)  And el predicto says Pens 6-laffs 1 for their 4th loss in a row and continuation of the fall back to normal for the laffs. Man , isn't Crosby  great ????"
773741,lickmyarmpit,2013-03-14 18:09:00,359,"Check this out I'm loving this, my wings back in east. Realignment for 2013-14 officially announced. Wings are headed East. http://redwings.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=660140"
773742,Leecher,2013-03-14 18:29:00,7832, Good point jedi... but I must of struck a sensitive nerve   GO HABS GO!!!
773743,Headhunter,2013-03-14 18:32:00,5703,"Who do I dislike more? The Sens, the Habs or the Dead Things? Welcome to the East Dead Things... things just got tougher for yah. HH"
773756,davey buoy,2013-03-14 20:43:00,5505,"Myself,I like the 2 points for the win,nothing for the loser.No matter how they decide it. JMO."
773758,jedimaster,2013-03-14 20:55:00,3472,"Yah its a tough one. I am totally fine with a 2 for the win, nothing for the loss. or 3 for the win in OT/reg 2 for a shootout win and 1 for a ot/shootout loss. Lots of ways to slice it but as it stands I really don't like how the current system rewards losing as much as it does."
773759,davey buoy,2013-03-14 20:58:00,5505,"My point exactly,prolong the game in the last few minutes if you can to at least get a point in overtime/shootout.Just doesn't seem right"
773760,davey buoy,2013-03-14 21:34:00,5505,"Anyway,things don't get any easier tonight."
773761,BillM,2013-03-14 22:00:00,17367,"I don't mind no points for a loss, but get rid of the shootout and play until someone scores."
773762,davey buoy,2013-03-14 22:03:00,5505,Like the good ole days!!!!!!I agree.
773764,Leecher,2013-03-14 22:50:00,7832," I wish it was Bill but the format you speak of, is only for the playoffs... I like the shoot out but put's incredible strain on the goaly   I think that after 3 periods and it's a tie.... no overtime and each team get's 1/2 point...  That would eliminate the extra point gain in OT and SO"
773769,BillM,2013-03-14 23:45:00,17367," How about 2 OT periods, if no one scores each team gets a point..   I hate the shootout to be honest."
773780,Leecher,2013-03-15 00:55:00,7832, Works for me Bill   Just got to get Gary Bettman to change the format
773786,DRIFTER_016,2013-03-15 01:43:00,10439,  How about after 2 OT periods if it's still tied an enforcer from each team fight for the win? Last one standing wins!!!!
773787,Leecher,2013-03-15 01:49:00,7832, Great idea Dave
773820,jedimaster,2013-03-15 13:45:00,3472,I would almost rather them just walk off the ice and the game end in a tie rather than do a shoot out to reward an extra point.

773995,knightfisher,2013-03-16 14:10:00,237,I don't like the SO. A hot goalie or shooter does not make a team effort. Both teams should be given a single point.   The leafs really need this win tonight. Lots of pressure on them. I except them to be on fire tonight.
773997,muskymatt,2013-03-16 14:14:00,2608,   If the laffs had more ties than regulation losses and benefited from it in the point standings you laffites would be praising the glory of the SO like it was the second coming    Instead you just keep losing like the laffs of old!!!!
774035,jedimaster,2013-03-16 18:47:00,3472,Big talk from the senioritas... 1 win in there last 7 as I recall..
774131,Dan668,2013-03-17 02:12:00,1120,what the hell were they thinking. Really Dion on the shootout.
774133,Jigger,2013-03-17 02:19:00,1237,"Yeah, was tginking the same. And Franzen before that. Grabovski wouldve ended that. Seems to me Carlyle doesnt like him too much."
774142,Dan668,2013-03-17 02:43:00,1120,I was yelling grabo the whole time
774187,BillM,2013-03-17 15:36:00,17367,I cannot believe they didn't put Grabo in...   That's an almost a gimme when he's in there..    At least it's a point..  Loved when the fans went insane after Lupuls first goal.   Glad to see him back.
774242,nancur373,2013-03-17 21:09:00,1211,Last 5 games. Leafs 0-5 Habs 5-0  OLE OLE OLE
773440,jedimaster,2013-03-13 00:48:00,3472,found one. pm me if you need one. the leafs are a bt sloppy so far playing tough.
773447,Jigger,2013-03-13 01:02:00,1237,2 things Sens fans will never have:  A playoff round where they win against the Leafs.  The other doesnt matter because the first one trumps anything you can say...

773521,muskymatt,2013-03-13 14:18:00,2608,I thought it was actually a very entertaining game!  
773527,BillM,2013-03-13 14:33:00,17367,"No bounces at all lastnight, Winnipeg goalie played awesome!"
773528,DRIFTER_016,2013-03-13 14:41:00,10439, But no where near as entertaining as this game!!! Remember Matt?  
773538,jedimaster,2013-03-13 14:58:00,3472,I thought I would update my avatar photo just for muskymatt.
773541,BillM,2013-03-13 15:06:00,17367,LOL!!!!
773560,muskymatt,2013-03-13 16:09:00,2608, Love it lol  Hmmmmmm.....Now where's my Tucker lying on his face photo ??

773593,danbouck,2013-03-13 19:40:00,4380,I like this one

773675,Leecher,2013-03-14 02:35:00,7832,Yeah... where's that Mushki-chat character to tell us all about his team's performance tonight  GO HABS GO!!!
773676,muskymatt,2013-03-14 03:45:00,2608," Seriously??????  Your habsucs with a full lineup get taken to OT and SO by a depleted Sens (PRAISE ALFIE) roster and your proud of the win????  Just goes to show why you ended last season in last place.    You habsucs are almost as bad as the laffites, who by the way have lost 3 in a row.....dismal... but expected.   "
773682,nancur373,2013-03-14 10:17:00,1211,a win is a win.
773686,Jigger,2013-03-14 11:03:00,1237,"Thank goodness for OT points, eh Mm?"
773694,Leecher,2013-03-14 13:08:00,7832, And what's your point???   Your Point .... Get it??? Sens got 1 and HABS got 2    That's all that matters eh  GO HABS GO!!!
773718,jedimaster,2013-03-14 15:36:00,3472,"Hey go easy on muskymatt, his team has only won 4 games of the last 10, its a good thing the NHL awards points for losing or they would be tied for 9th. I was hoping the league would go to a 3-2-1 point system. 3 Points for a regulation win, 2 for an overtime/shootout and 1 for an ot/shootout loss. Its starting to become soccer out there in the third period, teams just sitting back hoping for a tie."
773719,BillM,2013-03-14 15:38:00,17367,Hopefully a good game against the Sens (errrr I meant Pens) tonight!

773050,muskymatt,2013-03-11 00:41:00,2608,A bit of laff trivia for the laffites Who was the last laff player to win the Art Ross trophy? The person with the correct answer wins the right to watch the laffs suck for another 49 years. lololol
773060,BillM,2013-03-11 01:21:00,17367,Keep those Stanley Cup banners flying from ScotiaBank Place!...............oh wait a second.

773080,DRIFTER_016,2013-03-11 02:54:00,10439,"HMMMMMMMM, lets see. What would I rather have, an Art Ross trophy or 13 Stanley Cups?"
773082,Roy,2013-03-11 03:08:00,13728,Actually the Leafs have only won 11 cups....not 13.
773083,danc,2013-03-11 03:15:00,4677,He's including the next two years Roy.
773085,Roy,2013-03-11 03:21:00,13728,HAHAHAHA Touché
773086,DRIFTER_016,2013-03-11 03:24:00,10439,Actually I'm including the first when they were called the Toronto Arenas and the second when they were called The Toronto St. Patricks. They didn't become the Leafs until 1927.

773377,jedimaster,2013-03-12 19:28:00,3472,Its been 20 years since a canadian team last won the cup. Its funny my most hated teams are for the most part canadian. The only one on my top 5 most hated teams that I would root for is probably Montreal. Just beacause I know the part would be awesome if they ever win the cup again.  1) Ottawa 2) Montreal 3) Vancouver 4) Colorado 5) Boston
773386,muskymatt,2013-03-12 20:19:00,2608,"Of my 29 favorite teams, Habsucs are # 29. Only one team that is hated more. Hmmmmm........I wonder who that is.    Resting place of 49 years of coaches and players for sucking so bad     Laffs Suck!!  PRAISE ALFIE     "
773390,muskymatt,2013-03-12 20:36:00,2608," You're right, I do disagree with hitting from behind, cheap shots and taking advantage of someone when vulnerable. I don't condone those actions in any way, shape or form.  Period!!!!!!!!  Except maybe that one hit. And Chara's ragdoll of that guy who used to play for the laffs and score on his own net.  Any others are and always will be unacceptable.  Period!!!"
773397,misfish,2013-03-12 21:06:00,29133,   Thats not far back.LOL  My fav team back when ORR played. Best defenceman ever..  
773416,Jigger,2013-03-12 23:34:00,1237,"Wow, didn't think it would come to that. Terrible hit and can't believe you would think that was acceptable. Stay classy is right."
773418,muskymatt,2013-03-12 23:59:00,2608," It would be easy to assemble a rather lengthy list of incidents similar or worse than that hit that Darcy doled out himself. He played on that line and was both the receiver and deliverer.  Its no shock!!  2 things laff fans need to get over ok.....maybe that was 3, but you get the idea    Or maybe you don't because you're a laff fan    oh well!!"
773425,tb4me,2013-03-13 00:14:00,3295,"Great fight by Orr, rag dolled him..lol"
773427,jedimaster,2013-03-13 00:18:00,3472,anyone have a good feed? The ones I have are jumping?
772462,tb4me,2013-03-08 01:30:00,3295,He He He that was awesome... Now if one of our boys can do that again tonight to a guy in Yellow that would be even better
772473,jedimaster,2013-03-08 02:10:00,3472,Kessle versus seguin. haha
772477,muskymatt,2013-03-08 02:56:00,2608,"Hmmmmm...seems to me the laffs were largely outplayed by the SENS (PRAISE ALFIE) last night and managed to get the 2 points, didn't deserve the win but meh, whats ya gonna do?  That poor play carried over to tonight and the laffs are starting another losing streak.  As for the lucky punch, tough but the kids gotta learn, too bad laff fans take pleasure in an up and comer getting a concussion. but, I would expect any less.  Sens are only 2 points behind the laffs with a game in hand, and  with the laffs record the last 9 yrs and 48yrs, I wouldn't get too cocky yet  "
772479,kickingfrog,2013-03-08 03:02:00,8333,No sign of the biggest punchline on the board since before last nights game until after tonight's game. Stay classy.
772482,BillM,2013-03-08 03:07:00,17367,"Lucky punch?  Come on, why anyone would mess with McLaren is beyond me.  Even your pseudo tough guy Neil didn't want a piece of him..  Did you hear the hush that came over the fans when he went down?  Did that sound like a crowd out for blood?  I'm sure that loss still stings a bit, lol."
772485,kickingfrog,2013-03-08 03:13:00,8333,Nobody liked what happened at the end of that fight.
772490,salmon,2013-03-08 03:41:00,334,Too bad the kid got hurt but why have your first fight in the league against McLaren.  Neil just wanted a hug from Orr
772493,muskymatt,2013-03-08 04:04:00,2608,"Yup, seeing a  laff (kipper) go down in the same manner years ago was just as ugly. You have hope for the guys well being. After all, its a game."
772543,Jigger,2013-03-08 14:07:00,1237,"I thought the Leafs held their own against the Bull last night. Considering they played the second game in 2 nights against a far superior team than the previous evening, id say the outcome was predictable."
772560,jedimaster,2013-03-08 15:30:00,3472,"Too bad the coach gave him a tap on the shoulder to stand toe to toe against one fo the toughest fighters in the league. Stupid move on the part of the sens coaching staff imo. Noone fights in the first 30 seconds of a game without a tap on the shoulder. That should have been neil out there for that one. Noone wants anyone to ever get hurt in hockey. At least I don't. Now even krusty the clown.... well maybe a hurt a bit after the fake stick throwing incident. haha. The leafs did play a good game last night even though they lost. No doubt Boston is a better team overall, so losing to them in a hard fought game on the heals of a back to back I am totally fine with."
772589,Headhunter,2013-03-08 17:37:00,5703,"What did we learn from the Ottawa game? Our team can beat up their team! These aren't the Leafs of old, where no one sticks up for their team mates. These guys have some how finally got it! Kudos to Randy for that. It's gotta be making Burke crazy seeing the team he put together finally playing the way he had said all along... HH"
772592,BillM,2013-03-08 17:40:00,17367,Should have gotten rid of WIlson a loooooong time ago.
772593,muskymatt,2013-03-08 17:45:00,2608, And every other coach from the last 49 years
772601,jedimaster,2013-03-08 18:11:00,3472," How many coaches have the sens had that lead to a cup win? According to the 5 sens fans they have the most awesome depth, goal scorers, captain, defense and goaltedning, so surely any coach should be able to win a cup with them."
772613,muskymatt,2013-03-08 19:28:00,2608," OK, I'll give you that one! Pat was awesome"

772739,nancur373,2013-03-09 14:12:00,1211,awesome!!!
772878,tb4me,2013-03-10 02:15:00,3295,Good game so far tonight..Reimer looked horrible earlier..4-3 mid way thru the 3rd..Go Leafs Go!
772889,tb4me,2013-03-10 03:05:00,3295,That was an awesome game..Too bad we lost but it was a hard fought game..Reimer needs to work on his rebound control. JVR hit on Malkin was a real stinger but a clean beautifull hit.. We have a tough week ahead..Giver boys giver
772891,BillM,2013-03-10 03:10:00,17367,That's a well earned point!   Glad to see Frattin back in the line up!!!
772895,chris.brock,2013-03-10 03:18:00,4053,"Time for Gardiner to come back up too, I thought Reimer looked better in the 3rd, I'd start him again on Tuesday  I hate to say it, but I'd like Crosby to get crunched, he burned us tonight and he's killing me in my hockey pool"
772896,BillM,2013-03-10 03:22:00,17367,"He went for quite the ride tonight, lol"
772901,DRIFTER_016,2013-03-10 03:47:00,10439,"Both Reimer and Scrivens are down on the ice much too long when they go down for a save. They need to get their butts back up and in position and not flail around like epileptics!!!  Oh, and that was a nice flight by Crosby!!! The hit on Malkin was pretty nice also."
772947,jedimaster,2013-03-10 14:34:00,3472,"Good game last night they fought back and didn't give up. They were really on top of pits in the overtime. Reimer got exposed in net though. Even in the shootout, one in 5 hole and one over his glove."
772949,knightfisher,2013-03-10 15:19:00,237,"Leafs hung in there and earned a well deserved point. Leafs can't expect their goalies to be abused each night with so many shots against them and win.. The defence is the problem. Phaneuf is a huge problem on defence. Yes he got a few assists, but his defencive play is horrible. All the sports shows I listen to say the same thing about Phaneuf. Give him half the ice time and develope some of their other talent. As the coach said last night after the game, the defence needs to be alot better."
771862,jedimaster,2013-03-05 02:18:00,3472,That is how a powerplay is supposed to be done. Kadri... awesome... mcarthur great finish. Great save to keep it 3-2
771863,BillM,2013-03-05 02:19:00,17367,Finally woke up in the 3rd period!
771867,tb4me,2013-03-05 02:27:00,3295,Wow 3 ugly goals and a Real Beauty by Kessel from JVR.. Bout time..
771869,Jigger,2013-03-05 02:48:00,1237,"Too bad about Brown. Every team wants a guy like him. With Frattin close to coming back, they need the roster space. Hopefully it also means Lupul is close to returning as well!"
772072,jedimaster,2013-03-06 13:34:00,3472,"Big game tonight.   Leafs and senioritas... since we are at the midway point in the season what teams currently not in the playoff picture who do you think will challenge to move up? The last place team in the east is only 5 points out. And the caps have been improving on the horrible start. 7-3 in there last 10. All the other are wavering at 500 and don't look to be challenging or improving. As for the teams dropping the sens are starting to fall back to earth with all the injuries, if I was to have to pick a team to drop and a team to rise it would be sens and devils falling and caps and philli rising. If tampa gets a goalie who knows they have a potent offense."
772078,Headhunter,2013-03-06 14:05:00,5703," To some degree, I think that the ref's will play a huge part in how this year's playoffs unfold. Call everything or let them play... for the Hab's sake, they better call everything or the Habs are going to get beat up... not that there's anything wrong with that! HH"
772081,Jigger,2013-03-06 14:21:00,1237,"Boston has 3 games in hand and, the way theyve been playing this year, are the team to beat in the East IMO. Mtl wont hold on to first for too much longer. Kindof surprised at how Philly is sputtering and have a feeling that the Isles are going to sneak in. Leafs take it tonight."
772085,jedimaster,2013-03-06 14:39:00,3472,"Well the bruins could be said to have had a much easier schedule this year so far.... they have a busy month comming up so we will see how the bruins are with a busy schedule.  Injuries in a short season are tough, thats why I am leaning on the sens starting to crack and the Devils continuing to falter. For sure at least a couple teams that aren't currently in will get in, its like that every year 1-3 teams looking up make a run for it, and with the season so short,a dnso few points in between every game counts big time."
772219,tb4me,2013-03-07 00:15:00,3295,Wow what a fight! Mclearen KOed that sen in a skirt..Awesome
772220,davey buoy,2013-03-07 00:15:00,5505,"What a couple punches by Mclaren,hope the Ottawa player is Ok."
772231,tb4me,2013-03-07 00:28:00,3295,Wow 2-zip early in the first..Huge fight... what more can I ask far for a start tonight..
772233,nancur373,2013-03-07 00:32:00,1211,Because we are winning!!!!!!
772237,tb4me,2013-03-07 00:54:00,3295,Great first! wow....Lets hope the other 2 periods are this good
772238,DRIFTER_016,2013-03-07 00:58:00,10439,Got in a little late and missed the first 15 minutes. But the Leafs are up by 2 and Mclaren pummeled that poor senorita. I'm in my happy place!!!!!
772245,tb4me,2013-03-07 01:07:00,3295,Another one bites the dust... Silly Sens when will they learn...Gord Miller‏@GMillerTSN Ottawa Senators say that Dave Dziurzynski sustained a concussion in his first period fight with Toronto's Fraser McLaren and won't return.

772457,jedimaster,2013-03-08 01:19:00,3472,Sens have lost 4 in a row so e won't hear much for a while.
772458,DRIFTER_016,2013-03-08 01:22:00,10439,He's off pouting because Mclaren KOed one of his boys.
771080,jedimaster,2013-03-01 16:40:00,3472,Fact Leafs have 13 wins Fact Sens have 12 wins  I guess if you need to count loser points the sens are up by one point.
771081,Raf,2013-03-01 16:45:00,3495,Nice to see the boys in blue finding ways to win eventhough I don't think they are playing their best hockey of the year the last few games.  Previous season I think we would have been in a 3-7 streak but the fact that they are winning their share while not at their best tells me they are improved.
771170,nancur373,2013-03-02 00:10:00,1211,Apple doesn't support flash player
771247,tb4me,2013-03-02 05:49:00,3295,Wow bad move on apples part..I didnt know that.
771283,nancur373,2013-03-02 13:21:00,1211,Android my friend.....android
771320,davey buoy,2013-03-02 17:42:00,5505,"Let's hope these 3 days off,give them there legs back!!!New Jersey Monday can be a tough team anytime."
771324,tb4me,2013-03-02 18:10:00,3295,PC or BlackBerry for me....The wife has a windows phone that runs android..what a POS in my opinion
771325,BillM,2013-03-02 18:11:00,17367, A windows phone doesn't run Android...  A windows phone runs Windows.
771326,tb4me,2013-03-02 18:11:00,3295,Ya i feel as thou somone has stolen somthing from me tonight..Sat night without the leafs is like a sat night with out life...lol
771328,tb4me,2013-03-02 18:14:00,3295,"Funny cause I was told that all the apps are droid based on them things..Either way I know what i like, the Playbook with the latest OS is just as good as my sisters Ipad and a fraction of the price..The Zed10 is already doing things the wifes windows phone cant. Its all oranges and apples but the best fruit for me is a Berry!"
771329,davey buoy,2013-03-02 18:20:00,5505,"Me too,the Penguins and Habs could be a descent game.Didn't check,but I assume that will be the 7:00 game on CBC"
771341,BillM,2013-03-02 19:34:00,17367," The new BB is getting great reviews...  Good choice if you ask me,."
771460,jedimaster,2013-03-03 14:34:00,3472,What a shoot out last night in the pens game.
771702,BillM,2013-03-04 16:23:00,17367,"I really liked Brown, he's one of the guys that could change the momentum of a game with a single shift."
771710,tb4me,2013-03-04 16:43:00,3295,"This IMO is a bad move..Not what I wanted to see from Nunas fo rhis first trade..Here Komi sits and we dump Brown for a 4th round pick? bad bad bad..Fratten is back toinght and I understand that Nunas had to skinny up the roster by 1, but he will regret that trade...."
771717,Roy,2013-03-04 17:12:00,13728,Habs are doing better than I expected them to. Last night's game was a surprise!
771721,Headhunter,2013-03-04 17:27:00,5703,"I really liked Brown... as noted above, can be a real momentum changer... that said, he is just so injury prone that I don't feel like we have given up much. Not sure if a 4th rounder is enough, but Brown should help all those rookies in Edmonton... We just need to lose a couple of over-paid defensemen and all should be well. HH"
771750,jedimaster,2013-03-04 20:08:00,3472,Not a whole lot of tought guys that can play the game. I liked brown too. I figured Orr and one other roster guy would move for a first or second.
771752,davey buoy,2013-03-04 20:20:00,5505,"I thought the toughness was working for us, I guess I was wrong.I thought the two guys  on the bench would of been traded?.I'm sure there destined for somewhere."
771781,Chance,2013-03-04 22:12:00,420,"As in any trade you have to have a dance partner,not many lining up for Komi yet."
771784,davey buoy,2013-03-04 22:16:00,5505,"The papers say,there is interest. That's yet to be determined."
771786,Chance,2013-03-04 22:20:00,420,He has submitted a list of 12 teams but word has it he would go anywhere as he wants to play.Closer to the deadline with more injuries popping up he will move.Bad contract does not help either.
771817,misfish,2013-03-04 23:58:00,29133,"Why would they even disturb a line u,p thats been working. Big mistake IMO. Best leaf team in alonggggggggggggg time.  Ya I hear ya on helpping the young ones in Edmonton Joe.They wont get pushed around as much.."
771834,tb4me,2013-03-05 00:48:00,3295,1-0 after 1 .. Kadri with his 4th in 2 games..Reimer lookin real solid..No rebbounds so far..
771837,DRIFTER_016,2013-03-05 00:50:00,10439,If this were the Leafs of old they would be trading Kadri right now for some washed up has been. 
770973,BillM,2013-03-01 00:47:00,17367,"When the season started they were always first to the puck, in the corners, on the boards it didn't matter.  Even tonight they seem a step behind..   I dunno what's up with that.."
770979,tb4me,2013-03-01 01:12:00,3295,Actually it worked on my BlackBerry Z10 when i tested it
770980,DRIFTER_016,2013-03-01 01:18:00,10439,KADRI!!!
770981,tb4me,2013-03-01 01:18:00,3295,Scores Kadri again. 2 tonight.. Man Kessel is ticking me completely off..Sit that bum down Carlyle
770983,BillM,2013-03-01 01:20:00,17367,Finally some sustained pressure!!!
770984,DRIFTER_016,2013-03-01 01:20:00,10439,JVR!!!!
770985,BillM,2013-03-01 01:28:00,17367,"Kadri, HOLE E (fill in the blank)!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
770986,DRIFTER_016,2013-03-01 01:28:00,10439,KADRI WITH THE HAT TRICK!!!!!!
770987,tb4me,2013-03-01 01:28:00,3295,Wow Nazzzzzzzz with the Hat trick baby!!!!
770990,muskymatt,2013-03-01 01:40:00,2608,Yup at this rate  kapri will have Waynes records erased in no time.
770991,tb4me,2013-03-01 01:45:00,3295,"Thats exactally what id expect to hear from ""the "" Sens fan. Hey are you still going to ""Praise Alfie"" when they trade him away for a cup run..."
770992,DRIFTER_016,2013-03-01 01:55:00,10439,They won't trade him they'll just send him to the farm team down @ Shady Acres.  ARRRGH!!! My stream is being a pain all of a sudden!!
770993,muskymatt,2013-03-01 01:57:00,2608,"ALFIE (PRAISE ALFIE) Is not going anywhere with the Sens (PRAISE ALFIE) making the playoffs this year. But if he did go , the answer is yes, I would still Praise ALFIE.  Unless he went to the laffs, ugh"
770994,BillM,2013-03-01 01:57:00,17367,"Matts ultimate torture, lol!   Alfie in a Leafs jersey!"
770996,DRIFTER_016,2013-03-01 02:00:00,10439,  Pushing a broom around the locker room after the boys have left for the bar!!!
770997,jedimaster,2013-03-01 02:10:00,3472,For all this god talk and alfredson is awesome the sens must have a half dozen cups by now. Time to get wheel chair and walker out for that old goat. Put him out of his misery already. Maybe pull another chara trade again and get a bag of pucks for him.
770998,muskymatt,2013-03-01 02:17:00,2608,The Islanders are my 4th favorite team . Go Islanders Go
771002,BillM,2013-03-01 02:28:00,17367,Reimer has let way too many softies in tonight.
771005,Roy,2013-03-01 02:32:00,13728,Scores are looking decent tonight for all.
771006,BillM,2013-03-01 02:36:00,17367, He's no Brodeur!  LOL!
771007,bigugli,2013-03-01 02:37:00,6138,Please pull REIMER!!!
771009,tb4me,2013-03-01 02:39:00,3295,Wow big Dion on the drive from the blue line burries it to win in OT  Go Leafs Go!!!!!!! :clapping:
771010,DRIFTER_016,2013-03-01 02:39:00,10439,"WHEW!!!!!  Right off to watch the Winnipeg/Joisey game. And parts of the Edmonton game, and then the Flames game."
771011,jedimaster,2013-03-01 02:48:00,3472,Too bad the sens  lost and islanders lost eh matt. I guess you were rooting for double losers.
771017,muskymatt,2013-03-01 03:00:00,2608," See, Sins even rooting for the Sens.  The difference is, the Sens (PRAISE ALFIE) played arguably the best team in the east, and got a point and lost in OT on a weak fluky goal. The laffs however, played the 12th seeded team and needed overtime to win the game and according to many laff fan comments here, looked bad in the process.  Its like comparing playoff teams to non-playoff teams"
770729,BillM,2013-02-28 02:03:00,17367,Grabo should have drank a few Gatorades before that shot..  I'm surprised he didn't take a nap on the way to the net.  No jump in the step of the Leafs at all tonight.
770733,Nipfisher,2013-02-28 02:06:00,2449, I agree BillM. Pretty sure I could have given Price more problems on that penalty shot. I was hoping for the 2 minutes.
770735,DRIFTER_016,2013-02-28 02:06:00,10439,That's better!!!!
770736,jedimaster,2013-02-28 02:07:00,3472,Great feed from kadri to the open man.
770737,Nipfisher,2013-02-28 02:07:00,2449,Nice passing on the Leaf's 2nd goal.
770739,Nipfisher,2013-02-28 02:08:00,2449, I think the Franzen pass was better.
770742,BillM,2013-02-28 02:11:00,17367,"Gotta love the 3rd line, only decent line the Leafs have tonight me thinks."
770746,tb4me,2013-02-28 02:19:00,3295,This has been a great game no matter what side of the fence one sits on
770748,nancur373,2013-02-28 02:21:00,1211,interference???the puck was in his feet
770750,irishfield,2013-02-28 02:23:00,26272,Maybe they should bring back Kerry Fraser... lol..
770751,jedimaster,2013-02-28 02:27:00,3472,Keep brown and frazer up and send orr and kulemin down.
770752,irishfield,2013-02-28 02:32:00,26272,No no Jedi.. this idiot..  
770753,jedimaster,2013-02-28 02:32:00,3472,"First line bozak kessle and jvr, second line kadri lupal and fratin"
770755,jedimaster,2013-02-28 02:34:00,3472,"Irish, yah I know that guys was replying to another comment earlier about who gets sent down. Please don't bring back that goof. Him and mark hebsher are two guys I am glad aren't in the mainstream anymore."
770762,BillM,2013-02-28 02:53:00,17367,"So we go from not dropping the puck, to dropping it when the guys aren't ready, lol.  Ah well, Leafs play tonight is uninspiring to say the least.  Scrivens is giving up WAY too many rebounds as well, he's like a pin cushion."
770766,BillM,2013-02-28 03:05:00,17367,"Yup, good job Habs, well deserved win."
770770,nancur373,2013-02-28 03:21:00,1211,OLE OLE OLE OLE OLE OLE!!!!!!!!!!!
770779,jedimaster,2013-02-28 03:40:00,3472,Flat game by the leafs. No jump at all outside of a few good shifts in the first. Kessle line was minus 12 collectively.
770781,DRIFTER_016,2013-02-28 03:42:00,10439,Ouch!!!! Had to go to an appointment with 6 mins left and things were still in reach. The Habs played a great defensive game and the Leafs were flat the whole game.
770794,chris f.,2013-02-28 04:52:00,95,where was this call when gretzky high sticked gilmour? lol urgh!!!
770803,nancur373,2013-02-28 10:47:00,1211,Dude. That was 20 years ago...get over it
770957,tb4me,2013-03-01 00:16:00,3295,oh boy here we go again.....
770961,DRIFTER_016,2013-03-01 00:22:00,10439,JEEBAS!!! How good is Kadri this year!!!
770963,tb4me,2013-03-01 00:24:00,3295,"Man that was a beauty!!! Oh BTW thanks for the link lastnight Dave..My sister said it worked like a charm on her laptop, but not her Ipad..Either way YOU THE MAN!"
770970,DRIFTER_016,2013-03-01 00:37:00,10439,No problem. I'm not sure if it will run on my BB Playbook either. I seem to remember it doesn't but I haven't tried it in a year or two.  PHEW!!!!!
770546,tb4me,2013-02-27 16:27:00,3295,We take on the sideways toilet seats tonight...Go Leafs Go! Big ben starts and it looks like Reimer will be his backup..
770564,tb4me,2013-02-27 17:09:00,3295,"should also note, Brown and Orr draw back in tonight too.. Looks like Orr goes back on Kadri's line again.."
770570,DRIFTER_016,2013-02-27 17:29:00,10439,HAHAHA!!! The Younge Street Bullies!!!  Or York St. can't remember what freakin' street that ACC place is on. Been away to long I guess.
770573,BillM,2013-02-27 17:34:00,17367, Glad to see some muscle back out for tonight's game..  I hope it's a rough one!!!
770580,jedimaster,2013-02-27 18:06:00,3472,hahaha sideways toilette seats   Les Canadiens sont une tache sur le siège de toilette
770688,DRIFTER_016,2013-02-28 01:05:00,10439,"Too bad Phaneuf missed that hit on Subban. Subban wouldn't have known what country he was in had Dion connected!!!  Oh, and Mclaren scores!!!! BOO!!!! The poutine eaters evened it up!! ARRGH!!! Bull penalty with 37 secs to go. Tied @ 1 after 1"
770689,Roy,2013-02-28 01:13:00,13728,If there's one thing I've learned in my lifetime it's to never hatchet my counts before they chicken.
770693,BillM,2013-02-28 01:15:00,17367,"Wow, a 5min major for that?"
770694,DRIFTER_016,2013-02-28 01:16:00,10439,"  NAH, it's never too early!!!"
770697,DRIFTER_016,2013-02-28 01:21:00,10439,
770698,tb4me,2013-02-28 01:23:00,3295,Awesome first. We need to keep hitting them hard. The rest will come. Hey Dave do you have a link for tonight's game. My sister is asking me for a working link. Figured your the man to ask....
770704,jedimaster,2013-02-28 01:34:00,3472,Pretty lame penalty if you ask me. Been good hustle tonight.
770706,jedimaster,2013-02-28 01:37:00,3472,"Baha, lets see. I like the pk so far... hopefully I didnt just jinx them."
770707,DRIFTER_016,2013-02-28 01:41:00,10439,  http://ourleafs.blogspot.ca/
770709,DRIFTER_016,2013-02-28 01:42:00,10439,  Yep!!
770710,DRIFTER_016,2013-02-28 01:44:00,10439,We need a good old hockey fight!!!
770713,jedimaster,2013-02-28 01:52:00,3472,The habs don't fight they just hack and slash.
770714,nancur373,2013-02-28 01:53:00,1211,http://www.firstrow1.eu/watch/171747/1/watch-toronto-maple-leafs-vs-montreal-canadiens.html  once you get past the pop ups its ok. there's like 8 feeds to chose from
770717,nancur373,2013-02-28 01:55:00,1211,Look back a couple pages....i mentioned about Scrivens and his inability to swallow the puck. The Habs shots would be cut in half if he could hang on to a rebound
770719,nancur373,2013-02-28 01:56:00,1211,"Isn't Phaneuf one of the bigger on the team? He's a tard. ""I'll drop my stick, you drop your gloves, I'll skate away"""
770720,BillM,2013-02-28 01:56:00,17367,Penalty shot?  I'm a Leafs fan but these refs are out of their minds.
770721,DRIFTER_016,2013-02-28 01:59:00,10439, Bill It's a shortened season and the refs only have half as many games to get their full quota of penalties in.
770725,nancur373,2013-02-28 02:01:00,1211,That was nowhere near a breakaway...but thankfully Jesus Price made it look easy
770726,jedimaster,2013-02-28 02:02:00,3472,That hustle from the first period just went out the window.
770728,nancur373,2013-02-28 02:03:00,1211,I wouldn't call it drawing when he eyed the numbers from the blue line
770165,Chance,2013-02-25 22:13:00,420,weak at best...now explain the tiara.
770169,nancur373,2013-02-25 22:33:00,1211,
770170,nancur373,2013-02-25 22:34:00,1211,I believe he has a no movement clause which would prevent him from being sent down.
770174,misfish,2013-02-25 22:48:00,29133,Looking forward to the flyer game.tonight.
770179,DRIFTER_016,2013-02-25 23:00:00,10439, I am also looking forward to the game. GO LEAFS!!!  And the other game. GO HABS!!!
770197,muskymatt,2013-02-26 00:15:00,2608,Go Flyers The Flyers  are my  22nd favorite team.
770207,DRIFTER_016,2013-02-26 00:44:00,10439,"Ding, Ding, Ding!!!!"
770229,nancur373,2013-02-26 02:22:00,1211,Is he in a contract year? trying to boost his value maybe?
770230,nancur373,2013-02-26 02:23:00,1211,NM. still got like 4 years left at 5.5 mil
770231,jedimaster,2013-02-26 02:23:00,3472,What a pp by kadri. And go habs go.
770232,DRIFTER_016,2013-02-26 02:24:00,10439,"HMMMM, I don't know. He did just score the insurance goal."
770235,jedimaster,2013-02-26 02:32:00,3472,Hmm the double minor...
770240,nancur373,2013-02-26 02:47:00,1211,Scrivens is gonna have to learn to absorb the puck and stay up off his   if he's gonna make a career in the NHL
770243,jedimaster,2013-02-26 03:02:00,3472,By the skin of your teeth. Good hard fought road win in the face of brutal reffing.
770251,nancur373,2013-02-26 03:38:00,1211,Bishop played extremely well tonight. 44 saves. Horrible reffing. We will get them next time...GO HABS GO!!!
770253,muskymatt,2013-02-26 03:50:00,2608,"Bad reffing yes. good game for the most part. 5 in a row for the Sens (PRAISE ALFIE)  Great goaltending, Ottawa has great depth in goal."
770281,Jigger,2013-02-26 14:05:00,1237,"Terrible reffing across the league these days. Too many games, too little time?"
770288,jedimaster,2013-02-26 14:32:00,3472,I think the refs are doing too much. They are looking for too many little things and missing the important things. Call the basic penalties and let them play the game.
770319,jedimaster,2013-02-26 17:04:00,3472,"Yah, that's been called a few times, its crazy. Like either you dove, or you were tripped."
770322,Jigger,2013-02-26 17:06:00,1237,The two most obvious ones are Cory Perrys slash and Matt Duschenes offside. Both directly led to goals seconds later. Pretty sure both were gwg as well. Bruuutal non calls.
770323,Jigger,2013-02-26 17:08:00,1237,"Dont want to watch soccer, im ok with coincidental minors if the guy totally flops to get the call."
770329,BillM,2013-02-26 17:41:00,17367,I really wish the refs would just drop the wrong word puck and stop throwing guys out of the circle.  It's starting to become extremely annoying.
770403,nancur373,2013-02-26 23:02:00,1211,X2
770406,davey buoy,2013-02-26 23:07:00,5505,"Maybe there doing in spite,Don Cherry mentioned that in coaches corner about 3-4 weeks ago.I don't get why it's so hard to drop the puck?."
770412,tb4me,2013-02-26 23:50:00,3295,Montreal trades Erik Cole to get Michael Ryder back...Interesting move I supose..
769899,Chance,2013-02-24 17:58:00,420,"Enjoy ""good"" hockey banter just fine as in I would not complain about your jabs. when someone is just being a dink in order to try and irritate people that is far from ""good"" banter."
769903,davey buoy,2013-02-24 18:07:00,5505,I'm enjoying the quick wit of some of these debates.lol.All good fun foresure!!!!!!!!!!
769904,Chance,2013-02-24 18:10:00,420,"Naw ,dont take it serious at all .I think you misunderstood my post if that is what you got out of it. Nor do I give a fuzzy rats behind who wins the cup,super bowl etc...Now the Bass Master Classic is another topic all together"
769905,Chance,2013-02-24 18:12:00,420,"Agreed ,however a trade is in the works so lets see who stays and who goes. Liles maybe ???"
769908,nancur373,2013-02-24 18:26:00,1211,"But the comment was just that...good banter...all is fair in Habs/Leafs, Sens/Leafs, or any other team and Leafs trash talk...lol"
769941,jedimaster,2013-02-24 21:07:00,3472,Too bad melnyk chickened out and didn't try and kick the leafs fans out of the building. That would have been awesome to watch.
770054,nancur373,2013-02-25 14:59:00,1211,you guys thought he was  the best thing since sliced bread when you were able to 'lure' him away from the Habs. there is a reason we wouldn't give him a big contract. can you say glass jaw?
770059,davey buoy,2013-02-25 15:08:00,5505,Me too!
770083,nancur373,2013-02-25 17:23:00,1211,
770097,tb4me,2013-02-25 19:14:00,3295,Komi is just Komi.. He is average at best..I however dont understand why he is forced to sit this one out..This buyout rule sucks and needs to be changed..He should either be traded played or waived..Then if no one wants him he can play in the AHL this sitting crap sucks..Not fair at all
770103,jedimaster,2013-02-25 19:40:00,3472,What do you guys think is going to happen with lupe when he returns? back on the Kessle line and jvr goes down...? honestly I think they should try and bundle lupe and grabo and see what they can get.
770112,jedimaster,2013-02-25 20:10:00,3472,and bozak goes where? Don't forget he is one of the top face off guys in the league this year.
770113,jedimaster,2013-02-25 20:14:00,3472,I think Lupal Kadri and Frattin would make a good line
770117,BillM,2013-02-25 20:24:00,17367,"It's not a bad thing to have too many good players, lol.   I'm sure it will be figured out."
770119,tb4me,2013-02-25 20:29:00,3295,It will be interesting..Im totally suprised that Nonas hasnt put his mark on this Brian Burke team yet. Somthing will happen soon..Im looking forward to seeing what he does..Id be up for dealing Grabo and Lupes if the right player came in return..Getslav Ryan ect ect..With Burke scouting for the Ducks now I wonder if perhaps he and Nonas will be chatting?
770121,davey buoy,2013-02-25 20:31:00,5505,I think were just not use do this yet Bill. lol.
770123,BillM,2013-02-25 20:44:00,17367, LOL!!  I think you've gotta mix and match until you find 3 guys that gel together well.  The names on the back of the jerseys shouldn't matter.
770125,Roy,2013-02-25 20:48:00,13728,So we just got started! Are we planning for next year already?
770126,Bernie,2013-02-25 20:51:00,3190,"A guy walks into a bar and there is a robot bartender. The robot says, ""What will you have?"" The guy says ""Martini."" The robot brings back the best martini ever and says to the man, ""What's your IQ?"" The guy says, ""168."" The robot then proceeds to talk about physics, space exploration and medical technology.  The guy leaves, but he is curious, so he goes back into the bar. The robot bartender says, ""What will you have?"" The guy says, ""Martini"". Again, the robot makes a great martini, gives it to the man and says, ""What's your IQ?"" The guy says, ""100."" The robot then starts to talk about Nascar, Budweiser and John Deere tractors.  The guy leaves, but finds it so interesting, he thinks he will try it one more time. He goes back into the bar. The robot says, ""What will you have?"" The guy says, ""Martini"", and the robot brings him another great martini. The robot then says, ""What's your IQ?"" The guy says, ""Uh, about 50."" The robot leans in real close and says, ""So... you gonna cheer for the Leafs again this year?"""
770137,muskymatt,2013-02-25 21:10:00,2608,Like that's a surprise??????  They've (Laff fans) already traded away half the team!!!!    Go SENS GO (PRAISE ALFIE)
770138,muskymatt,2013-02-25 21:11:00,2608, Now that's funny!! 
770143,muskymatt,2013-02-25 21:14:00,2608, If you have good players then you can trade them for good players...

769684,Jigger,2013-02-23 13:45:00,1237,True enough. But more relevant because they actually count this year.

769688,grizzlybri,2013-02-23 13:54:00,565,"I'm a leafs Fan and i have to agree, come on fellow leaf fans you need to let it go, it has been 20 years since the ""blowen"" call. Look at how many coaching changes, and managment changes and even owners the leafs have gone threw since then. I don't blame any of the 3 hall of famers involed,  Fraser has even admited to blowing the call. Us Leaf fans should not complain about the kessel trade, or any other one in between, the fact fo the mater is thats hockey, fans as we just need to realize that there are 29 other teams besides the leafs and us, need to stop making excusses for a team that we will continue to spend crazy amount of money just for disapointment."
769689,nancur373,2013-02-23 14:08:00,1211,well said...but you're still a leaf fan.
769690,Jigger,2013-02-23 14:14:00,1237,"I haven't been disappointed at all this year. In fact, I prefer the contracted schedule over an 82 game season. Makes every game matter that much more, especially when you consider that every game is against a conference team. Doesn't hurt that the Leafs look like they've turned the corner and put the past behind them (Praise Burkie  )."
769691,grizzlybri,2013-02-23 14:21:00,565,"I will give you that the Leafs have been playing great so far this year and yes Burkie did build a good team , so I'm hopeful that they will make the palyoffs this year but because of years of disapointment my hopes aren't that high."

769720,DRIFTER_016,2013-02-23 16:50:00,10439, So why the bashing then? Seems like the Habs need the Leafs in order to win. If they hadn't lost to the Leafs the Habs would be in the basement with Barfalo!!!
769736,tb4me,2013-02-23 19:33:00,3295,Lol now thats funny!
769820,muskymatt,2013-02-24 02:55:00,2608,I would like to personally thank all the laff fans who populated the seats of our fine arena while the SENS(PRAISE ALFIE) beat the laffs. The money you laff fans pumped into the Ottawa economy is much appreciated.  Laffs suck  
769823,muskymatt,2013-02-24 03:11:00,2608,"Hey, where have all the laff fans gone?  Surely they haven't gone to mourn already, or attend to their mangina !"
769824,knightfisher,2013-02-24 03:13:00,237,"Leafs still very much a work in progress. Senators did well, with many of their players out. Good to see the Habs win. Hope all three make the playoffs.  "
769825,danc,2013-02-24 03:15:00,4677,Leafs fan here but I'm smart enough to not get into this silly little on line battle. No crow eating here. Congrats Matt. No excuses from me.
769830,BillM,2013-02-24 04:25:00,17367,Ottawa definitely had the bounces going their way this evening.   Congats to the Sens!    Loved some of that wide open hockey!
769848,nancur373,2013-02-24 14:51:00,1211,HABS WIN!!!! LEAFS LOOOOOOOOOOOOOSE!!!! don't get much better than that right there I tell you what.
769857,solopaddler,2013-02-24 15:32:00,8605,"Great game last night, was a lot of fun to watch. Full marks to the Sen's, Maclean is working miracles as far as I'm concerned. I just wish he'd trim his moustache, it looks like he has a wolverine on his upper lip."
769859,Chance,2013-02-24 15:50:00,420,"Oh I dont know ,living life maybe ? Bro you seriously need a life change.You are posting on a Saturday night trying to irritate people on a fishing forum about hockey.Get out , see a movie,go for a walk ...anything."
769868,nancur373,2013-02-24 16:28:00,1211,If you can't enjoy good hockey banter then you need not to post here.
769879,BillM,2013-02-24 16:47:00,17367,I am fairly certain all this banter is just to ruffle a few feathers and have a little fun.    Don't take the internet so seriously.
769880,Jigger,2013-02-24 16:52:00,1237,"Leafs were outplayed most of the game. Have to give it to Maclean, hes been able to get the most out of that squad. Full marks to the Sens."
769883,tb4me,2013-02-24 16:56:00,3295,Well I for one enjoy the banter...Life wouldnt be the same without ya Muskymatt..lol If we would stop playing the injured Gunnerson and call Jake Gardiner back  2 of those goals wouldnt have happened lastnight.Gunnar admitingly is playing hurt and just stood there and watched the Sens score not once but twice..I think he is done untill further notice..Please Nunas bring back Jake
769884,BillM,2013-02-24 17:01:00,17367,"Agreed, Gunnerson just looks slow out there..   Gardiner deserves that spot...   Hopefully Carlyle realizes that after lastnight's game.  Scrivens also needs to stop the puck juggling.."
769586,nancur373,2013-02-22 22:07:00,1211,It's the center of people who throw good money at a poor product.
769588,Chance,2013-02-22 22:18:00,420,You buy a ticket to be entertained on the night you sit in the seat.Ottawa fans are amazing in their own right.No cup EVER and they both still show up at every game.
769589,tb4me,2013-02-22 22:19:00,3295,Hey PURENEWF who is your team please do tell. All is fair in this game we call banter...lol
769591,Chance,2013-02-22 22:20:00,420,If the product is so poor this year why are they ahead of the sens in the standings ??  My fav Alfie moment....oh the grit and determination !!   
769592,tb4me,2013-02-22 22:26:00,3295,
769593,tb4me,2013-02-22 22:28:00,3295,"Actually you would be wrong there..Sens won the cup in 1920, 21 and 1927 and a whole bunch of times before that...lol But seriously they have won it "
769596,DRIFTER_016,2013-02-22 22:30:00,10439,"HMMMMMMM, then why do they keep harping the Leafs not winning a cup in 40+ years? Especially if they haven't won one in 80!!!!"
769602,solopaddler,2013-02-22 22:41:00,8605, It's taking the good and lamenting the bad but never wavering. For better or for worse it's called being a Leaf fan and there's lots of us.
769607,Chance,2013-02-22 23:01:00,420,Nope .....different franchise. That franchise folded and then went to the U.S. Fifty or so years later the new franchise asked to use the sens name .
769613,muskymatt,2013-02-22 23:22:00,2608,"Wow, a guy steps out for a few minutes and look what happens.  Isn't it ironic that fans of a team that has not made the playoffs in 9 years and hasn't won a cup in almost 50 years would be criticizing any other team, especially one that has won conference titles and presidents cup and has made the playoffs 13 of the past 15 years.  Isn't it hypocritical they would have any comment whatsoever on levels of success.  These are the same laff fans that come on this same site year after year whining and crying on how much the ownership sucked, how brutal the players were, so on so on wah wah wah  Now the poor little laffy fans have what might be their best season, as pathetic as it seems, in a decade, and they all jump back on the wagon and strut around with their heads in the cloud spouting the 2nd coming.  Entertainment at its best  man I love this site"

769619,muskymatt,2013-02-22 23:50:00,2608,I was having my pre-laff bashing nap if you must know!
769621,Chance,2013-02-22 23:55:00,420,"Seems your the only one strutting around spouting the second coming.Praise who was that again.Your at it once again with the cryin...we lost our best d man our best goalie oh no now what. If this is your best form of entertainment you need to put down the cat food and get out of moms basement,there is a BIG world out there."
769624,kickingfrog,2013-02-23 00:08:00,8333,"I should have known, my four year old has a similar schedule."

769628,Chance,2013-02-23 00:38:00,420,Just facts and observations.
769660,nancur373,2013-02-23 03:25:00,1211,Only the GREATEST team to ever play the game   
769670,Jigger,2013-02-23 12:57:00,1237,They've played pretty awesome hockey against the Leafs this year.
769676,Roy,2013-02-23 13:16:00,13728,"Get over it Sinc., that was 20 years ago. If, if, if...if my mother had had a scrotum, she would have been my father."
769679,nancur373,2013-02-23 13:36:00,1211,Leaf fans still clutching to a 'woulda coulda shoulda' involving 3 guys who haven't been in the league for some time. You guys need something positive to cheer about. .....then again no you don't. I wish the blown call is all you guys have to talk about for the next 100 years.....GO HABS GO!!!!!
769680,Jigger,2013-02-23 13:41:00,1237,"Only proves that yesterday is history and, as of today, the Leafs have outscored the Habs 8-1 to lead the season series 2-0."
769681,nancur373,2013-02-23 13:42:00,1211,I'll lose to the leafs every time as it starts us a 4-5 game winning streak
769682,Roy,2013-02-23 13:42:00,13728,"OK, you've been very civil, Adam. I'll grant you that."
769683,nancur373,2013-02-23 13:43:00,1211,those games are in the past. they're history...
769460,DRIFTER_016,2013-02-22 02:02:00,10439,Nice!!! Mclaren just laid a beatdown on Scott!!!
769462,chris.brock,2013-02-22 02:07:00,4053, Leafs- team with most fights/ hits in the league
769463,DRIFTER_016,2013-02-22 02:11:00,10439,"EXTRA, EXTRA!!!! ANGRY MIDGET ATTACKS PHANEUF!!!!Film at eleven!!!!!"
769470,tb4me,2013-02-22 02:52:00,3295,Wow as if it wasnt bad enough for Sens fans but now Anderson is out..Whos fault this time Musky Matt? Praise Alfie he is all ys got now...
769471,chris.brock,2013-02-22 02:55:00,4053, Bring on the Sens!  Maybe MM wants to make a friendly bet with us Laff fans?
769472,kickingfrog,2013-02-22 02:59:00,8333,"Tough one for Phaneuf. He can't let someone push and punch him after the whistle, but you get no love for beating on someone half your size. Mouthy little guys don't know how many times they don't get a whooping because a bigger guy knows this."
769473,BillM,2013-02-22 03:20:00,17367,"Alfie should go to Boston, lol."
769476,muskymatt,2013-02-22 03:54:00,2608," Bad luck, nothing more, Just more bad luck!  Brutal though, we lost the 4th top scorer from last year, the best defenseman in the league and now the best goalie in the league. Bright side is, we're still winning, 3 wins in a row, 2 points out of first in the east.  Man the Sens (PRAISE ALFIE) could use a break though, not good for the league in general to have so many top players out.  And no! I can't bet.  Its against fan etiquette to bet with fans of teams who have not made the playoffs in 9 years.  If I bet, I would be breaking the rules."
769478,BillM,2013-02-22 04:01:00,17367,Can I have some of what you're smoking?
769523,tb4me,2013-02-22 17:13:00,3295,This I honestly belive to be 100% true..Now the local Toronto and Hamilton radio stations have bought up a bunch of tickets and are giving them away with cash and a train ride for the night..All they have to do in return is make a ton of noise and report back to the station live...either the fan 590 or tsn 1050 is giving away 2 tickets and a thousand bucks to fans wearing blue..This is gonna be awesome..Go Leafs Go! Blow Sens Blow
769525,DRIFTER_016,2013-02-22 17:29:00,10439,I can't wait for tomorrow night. This is going to be fun!!!!
769527,jedimaster,2013-02-22 17:43:00,3472,I think melnyk knew exactly what he was doing. He knows the sens fans won't show up so is using reverse phsycology stunt to get more leafs fans out to the game. If the actually confiscate tickets of fans wearing leaf jerseys the coral centre will burn to the ground.
769547,tb4me,2013-02-22 20:15:00,3295,I wonder if he and Mr. Muskymatt are related? seems to be allot of that with sens Owners and fans lately
769549,jedimaster,2013-02-22 20:16:00,3472,http://www.scribd.com/doc/125377125/Sens-want-Leafs-fans-out-of-The-Bank   http://www.ottawasun.com/2013/02/13/keep-toronto-maple-leafs-fan-out-of-the-bank
769559,muskymatt,2013-02-22 20:49:00,2608,"haha I wish, with a relative with his money and a successful hockey team that has top players in the league(although hurt at the present time), what more could you ask for.  As for the laffs, well at least the team has money as well. The success and good players, well maybe not so lucky for that.  And what's wrong with a healthy yapping now and then??  The laffs offer plenty to yap about."
769561,muskymatt,2013-02-22 20:54:00,2608,   Bwahahahaha I love it!!!!  Sooooo true  
769565,DRIFTER_016,2013-02-22 21:07:00,10439,"  BWAHAHAHA!!!! truth hurts, don't it?"
769572,nancur373,2013-02-22 21:29:00,1211,you can't retire anyone who hasn't won anything in nearly 50 years
769573,jedimaster,2013-02-22 21:33:00,3472,"If they start taking tickets away and don't let the leaf fans in I have a feeling like ""The Bank"" is going to be burned to the ground. Its going to be bedlam. This is THE MUST WATCH game of the year."
769575,nancur373,2013-02-22 21:39:00,1211,they are losers just like the leafs
769576,Chance,2013-02-22 21:41:00,420, You have a dilussional concept of success as it usually involves winning something in sports.....you know that big silver thing at the end of the year.Ottawa isnt even successful in filling the seats with fans.tsk tsk always the dumb little brother nobody cares about.
769580,DRIFTER_016,2013-02-22 21:55:00,10439,  Fixed it for ya Sinclair!!
769581,tb4me,2013-02-22 21:56:00,3295,"Was this garbage seriously written by a professional or just some drunk stoned sens fan? Go Leafs go....Loutish Leafs lovers have long been boorish boozed-up bozos at the Bank, even booing gentleman Captain Daniel Alfredsson who, lest we forget, is God Himself, at least according to certain smart phones. (Leafs sniper Phil Kessel is also considered to be God, but mainly by the good people of Boston. The Lord gaveth when he tooketh himself the heck out of town, they say.) Fresh from the neighbourhood rink, Bruce Blackie praised the idea. Heckling Alfie is a “huge insult,” he said."
769583,nancur373,2013-02-22 21:59:00,1211,It's because of leaf fan mentality that there is a waiting list for tickets. Hence why they will never do the right things to win. No playoffs in almost a decade and keeps raising prices every year......dumb fans
769584,DRIFTER_016,2013-02-22 22:04:00,10439,There is a reason the Hockey Operations Centre and the Hockey Hall of Fame are in Toronto.  IT'S THE CENTRE OF THE HOCKEY UNIVERSE!!!!!     :tease:
768749,tb4me,2013-02-19 03:13:00,3295,Leafs just won 6 of 7 including 3 shutouts Orr on the 3rd line for 2 games in a row..Whats going on with this team..Im loving it..
768753,BillM,2013-02-19 03:28:00,17367,I think we can add Florida to the list of cities (Ottawa is included in this list) where the Leaf fans drown out the home team crowd.

768756,BillM,2013-02-19 03:50:00,17367,We were wondering where you disappeared to  :)
768773,Nipfisher,2013-02-19 13:33:00,2449,He hasn't been able to see the computer screen through all the tears of losing Spezza and Karlson.
768819,tb4me,2013-02-19 17:01:00,3295,"I wont make jokes about loosing  key guys weather it be Montreal, Ottawa or any other team. Karma is a you know what.Hockey gods think alot like the fishing gods...Sure sucks that the Sens aren't all that competitive this year.. I was looking forward to that rivalry.. This season isint over yet..Go Leafs Go Tampa tonight..Big Ben starts again..Its been a day over a week and still no word on Reimer..Perhaps its time the media call his Mom ike they did with his head injury...lol"
768822,jedimaster,2013-02-19 17:08:00,3472,Reimer is slated to start skating today... What happens if scrivens posts another blank before reimer gets back...
768824,BillM,2013-02-19 17:11:00,17367,"Scrivens is there to do a job, win games until Reimer gets back... When he's healthy, he's the starter."
768840,tb4me,2013-02-19 18:38:00,3295,Sounds about right to me..Scrivens will need a break by the time Reims gets back..
768946,tb4me,2013-02-20 00:56:00,3295,Well were down 1-0 Go Leafs Go!!!
768947,DRIFTER_016,2013-02-20 00:58:00,10439,OH NO!!!! IT's OVER!!! . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Scriven's shutout streak that is.
768963,tb4me,2013-02-20 01:49:00,3295,ya I was hoping for a 3rd game in a row...lol Dream on eh
768971,DRIFTER_016,2013-02-20 02:01:00,10439,"Tampa, another city where Leaf fans outnumber the home teams fans!!!"
768985,jedimaster,2013-02-20 02:39:00,3472,I would rather we outnumber them in goals.
768996,DRIFTER_016,2013-02-20 03:03:00,10439,Need more fights!!!
769003,muskymatt,2013-02-20 03:34:00,2608,Yep. Laff fans everywhere are watching the laffs lose. The Sens on the other hand(PRAISE ALFIE) had a character win with 2 of the call ups getting their first ever NHL goal. Anderson (the best goalie in the league) was awesome once again.  I can just see the laffs fans lining up for Anderson Sens jerseys now!  
769009,kickingfrog,2013-02-20 03:46:00,8333,Just cause the sens will be mailing it in doesn't mean you have to.
769010,DRIFTER_016,2013-02-20 03:51:00,10439,  BAZINGA!!!!!
769041,Chance,2013-02-20 13:49:00,420,Should be lots available considering the stands are full of Leaf jerseys.Must be tough being the dumb little brother that nobody cares about.
769420,tb4me,2013-02-22 00:17:00,3295,"Leaf game tonight, any Leafers watching in OFC land? Big Benn with 2 HUGE saves on Vanek, wow"
769430,jedimaster,2013-02-22 00:34:00,3472,"yah watching here, down 1-0 again, better get on the horse and put a stop to that mess."
769443,DRIFTER_016,2013-02-22 01:12:00,10439,Of course it's streaming on the big screen here in Yellowknife.   JVR doing laps around the Sabres while on the PK = PRICELESS!!!!
769450,tb4me,2013-02-22 01:36:00,3295,Wow what a pass by Kessel to set JVR up out front..were up 2-1
769452,chris.brock,2013-02-22 01:46:00,4053," JVR looks good, I don't care if Kessel's goal stats aren't great, if he makes plays, and the teams winning, I'm happy  just noticed tonight, I thought # 21 was retired (Salming), JVR's #"
769456,jedimaster,2013-02-22 01:52:00,3472,Leafs don't retire numbers they only honour them.
768356,tb4me,2013-02-17 02:58:00,3295,Great game. What more can I say Big Ben with the no no 
768357,muskymatt,2013-02-17 03:00:00,2608,"Not at all. Actually, being that the SENS (PRAISE ALFIE) have 23 million is salaries not playing due to injury and had 1 full line of guys who were playing their 1st ever NHL games, I'd say a 3-0 loss (one being empty net) is not a bad outcome. In fact, the Laffs and their fans should be embarrassed that they didn't spank the SENS (PRAISE ALFIE). But then it's hard to shake 47 years of sucking no matter how much of an advantage you have  "
768359,muskymatt,2013-02-17 03:02:00,2608,Now that's just plain laughable  You're kidding right
768360,Christopheraaron,2013-02-17 03:05:00,3525,2 points is 2 points where I come from
768362,muskymatt,2013-02-17 03:12:00,2608,YUP.
768363,jedimaster,2013-02-17 03:18:00,3472,"The leafs are down a few guys too including there top center, there top goalie, top young defenseman and one of there best offensive producers this year. Actually the leafs are down more players than the sens right now so if I was a sens fan I would be embarrassed about getting spanked. What ever happened to that infinite depth the sens were supposed to have."
768364,kickingfrog,2013-02-17 03:21:00,8333,Who is this alphie you speak of? I didn't see him tonight. Is he the one spezza threw his back out carrying this year?
768374,jedimaster,2013-02-17 04:21:00,3472,To be honest I am pretty impressed that muskymatt has been able to maintain his dedication to a team as lowsy as the sens. A bit blind but kudos for commitment.
768415,DRIFTER_016,2013-02-17 15:45:00,10439, Kinda like us Leafs fans huh?
768428,jedimaster,2013-02-17 16:56:00,3472,Haha yep. He is almost like a leaf fan accept of course the whole no stanley cup thing.
768701,tb4me,2013-02-19 01:28:00,3295,Good first.. Big Ben has been stellar in his moment to shine..Yikes.
768707,danc,2013-02-19 01:47:00,4677,And an accurate one too. How many posts/cross bars has he dinged this year already?
768709,tb4me,2013-02-19 01:56:00,3295,Lol DING! Kadri!
768711,Jigger,2013-02-19 01:59:00,1237,And DING! MacArthur lol
768712,tb4me,2013-02-19 02:00:00,3295,"Ding, Macarthur..all 3 leafs goals tonight have hit metal..Ding!"
768714,danc,2013-02-19 02:02:00,4677,No. It was Clarke MacArthur.
768715,tb4me,2013-02-19 02:02:00,3295,ohh Dion huge hit...lol
768717,tb4me,2013-02-19 02:03:00,3295,Close enough for me...lol
768724,DRIFTER_016,2013-02-19 02:23:00,10439,Say hello to my little friend!!!!  
768725,jedimaster,2013-02-19 02:24:00,3472,"haha great pic, awesome game from the kadri, mcarthur and orr line so far."
768738,kickingfrog,2013-02-19 02:58:00,8333,Holiday in the states (and here) and there are about as many people in my living room as there are butts in the seats in Florida.
768742,jedimaster,2013-02-19 03:01:00,3472,"Yah, crazy. Good thing they paint the lower bowl red so it looks like home jerseys."
768743,BillM,2013-02-19 03:03:00,17367,You can probably get into that game for $10!
768744,jedimaster,2013-02-19 03:08:00,3472,Back 2 Back Blanks for Scrivens!!! Loving that I put him in my weekly pool.
768747,kickingfrog,2013-02-19 03:10:00,8333,They might even pay you $20.
767797,Headhunter,2013-02-14 16:07:00,5703,"The Sens have probably bought thousands of soothers for their fans to suck on during the game and I'm sure that the Sens Management doesn’t want any Leaf fans making fun of them. What a bunch of Pansies...Re Bob Cole... should have retired a decade ago... I'm all for nostalgia, but he might as well be watching another game based on his verbal description of the game being played in front of him. Add to that that he is a Habs fan, who clearly demonstrates that at every chance, time for him to move back to the Rock and settle down to some flipper pie!HHEdit - I forgot the obligatory ""Ooh baby!"""
767799,BillM,2013-02-14 16:18:00,17367,"Bob Cole on his worst day is better then Simpson, Hughson and Healy on their best..    I don't need Cole to tell me what's going on in the game, I'll use my eyes for that.   His voice IS HNIC....  An absolute legend."
767816,Headhunter,2013-02-14 17:42:00,5703,"Yes, Bob is/was a legend, just like the penny. HH"
767863,jedimaster,2013-02-14 20:54:00,3472,"Dang, leafs game on valentines day, who planned that one out?"
767870,Jer,2013-02-14 21:39:00,1426,"  Don't worry, it's blacked out...(on LeafsTV)."
767872,DRIFTER_016,2013-02-14 21:44:00,10439, But not on http://ourleafs.blogspot.ca I have a dedicated laptop for streaming to my big screen.
767916,tb4me,2013-02-15 01:10:00,3295,anyone have a better link then the one above its not working worth a crap...
767917,DRIFTER_016,2013-02-15 01:25:00,10439,They fixed it eventually. Although I did get pretty freaked out when it changed to the TB/WSH game for a minute.
767919,chris.brock,2013-02-15 01:27:00,4053," I agree, he's a legend, I grew up listening to him  I hate to say it, but I think he should call it quits, I now find him painful to listen to, incoherent ramblings  my favorite is Joe Bowen  JMHO"
767921,DRIFTER_016,2013-02-15 01:33:00,10439, I'm incoherent most of the time so I understand him.
768086,muskymatt,2013-02-15 21:11:00,2608,"If the laffs would have had anything that even remotely resembled success in recent memory, maybe the fans would know what its like to lose an opportunity of a great run. But the haven't, so how could a laff fan possibly relate.  Losing Spezza and then to turn around and lose Karrlson the way we did is criminal. Cooks actions and how Karrlson got hurt were intentional, and Cooke should have been reprimanded by the league. The fact that he was not would and should infuriate team mates, owners and coaching staff, not to mention the fans. Now that our hopes for making the playoffs is effectively dead and gone, I hope the rest of the team, driven by bitterness, pays this injustice forward. Smash Crosby, smash Malkin, smash Kessel, smash whoever, and goon up every game from here to the end of the season. Cooke should not be playing in this league and many top players have fallen to his inexcusable antics............enough is enough.  Anyone who can't see, by the video, that it was intentional, hasn't a clue about hockey."
768091,jedimaster,2013-02-15 21:40:00,3472,I think Melnyk should look in the mirror before he speaks.... and to say it was intentional is insane. Look at it on regular speed. No way did he step on his ankle on purpose. Perhaps the most insane thing I have ever heard.  2011/2012 Stats  PIM 178
768094,muskymatt,2013-02-15 22:01:00,2608,"Chris Neil has never taken cheap shots on anyone , nor done anything remotely similar to any one of the numerous infractions Cooke has committed. To compare the 2 is asinine, and inaccurate. Like I said before, anyone who looks at that play and doesn't see wrong, is not looking at it objectively."
768095,jedimaster,2013-02-15 22:07:00,3472,"Seems pretty to be a pretty accurate comparison to me. In fact you are about the only person I have ever heard calling for any action on Cooke for this accident. The NHL, Radio stations, TSN, Sportsnet, CBC even on the Sens FB page try and be a little bit objective yourself. Is it unfortunate? No doubt. Karlson has a bright future ahead of him. Maybe he will wear some kevlar socks."
768123,DRIFTER_016,2013-02-16 00:50:00,10439,  
768139,tb4me,2013-02-16 01:45:00,3295,"Musky Matt your dreaming if you think he meant to do that...lol Your above comments made me laugh thou..Thanks for that..I hate to see a skilled player go down like that but it is what it is..Crying foul when there is nothing to cry about only makes you look like a Sens fan, oh wail....Yup the shoe fits..Perhaps your crying foul would be better received herehttp://fans.senators.nhl.com/community/forum/24-sens-talk/We will see ya bums tomorrow night..Were beat to Hell too so this should be interesting....."
768167,muskymatt,2013-02-16 03:28:00,2608,"What , are you freaking kidding. Hossa was taking a shot and hit him with a follow through. Why am I arguing with a fan of a team that hasn't made the playoffs in 9 years? It against the fan code...."
768170,muskymatt,2013-02-16 03:31:00,2608,"Its more of just how Cooke plays, reckless, and no etiquette. Another Cooke victim, and it's about time it stops. Can't blame me for being pissed about it. Laff fans would react the same way, if not worse"
768177,jedimaster,2013-02-16 03:59:00,3472,"Wasn't Neil getting the gears from the rangers last year for a late hit in the playoffs where he left his feet. The point is that the hit to karlson was clean and routine. Just happened to be a freak accident. Noone in hockey is happy about it, most everyone probably has him in there hockey pool. Even if they hate the sens. I know he was in my hockey pool. To be honest its a bit dissapoiting it was a clean hockey play. I mean if he is gonna go down from a guy like cooke, if it was a dirty hit at least he would have been suspended. The point is Melnyk is a fool for crying about it and calling for cookes head."
768319,davey buoy,2013-02-16 23:01:00,5505,So are we all ready for the battle of Ontario tonight?.At least on Saturdays it's not on leafs channel! lol.
768320,tb4me,2013-02-16 23:03:00,3295,"Im ready , but ill only be watching the first, then switching over to the Race! Go Leafs and 78 Go!"
768348,jedimaster,2013-02-17 02:25:00,3472,WOOT WOOT!!!! go leafs go... I put scrivens in my hockey pool.... lets hope he can hold on..
768352,DRIFTER_016,2013-02-17 02:38:00,10439,"AWWWWWW, I bet MuskyMatt is a saaaaaaaad panda!!!!  "
768354,kickingfrog,2013-02-17 02:44:00,8333,"Two Saturdays in a row and the zeros produce a zero.  Maybe they can ask to play on a different day. Then they won't have to worry about their ""fans"" selling tickets to another teams fans."
768355,kickingfrog,2013-02-17 02:56:00,8333,For what it is worth Cooke is not considered a repeat offender under the rules of both the old and new cba.  The injury was nothing more then an accident.  Why every player doesn't wear kevlar is beyond me.
767194,jedimaster,2013-02-12 03:08:00,3472,HAHAHAAH OMG check out this twee from Roberto Luongo... His twitter account is strombone1   
767197,tb4me,2013-02-12 03:22:00,3295,No Loungo please.. if we need a guy to fill the hole short term get dayne rolison and ride scrivens or somthing like that..
767325,jedimaster,2013-02-12 20:02:00,3472,"Reimer has a ""Mild MCL Strain"" according to TSN radio, out for minimum of 1 week. The guy said kipper has been out for 1 week, and now an additional 2 weeks for the same injury.  1 or 2 weeks, no big deal, no need to make moves, bring up another marlies goalie and let scrivens run the show. 3 or 4 weeks, thats tough."
767327,davey buoy,2013-02-12 20:24:00,5505,"Tough,give him some starts,but we've seen what happens after a couple starts. This is his big ""show"",hope he does well."
767328,BillM,2013-02-12 20:39:00,17367,Scrivens is a fine #1 goalie.   Let him do the job while Reimer heals up.
767330,jedimaster,2013-02-12 20:54:00,3472,It wouldn't be the first time a number 1 goalie went out with an injury and came back to be number 2. I seriously hope we ar ein that position versus us begging for reimer to get back.
767345,tb4me,2013-02-12 22:02:00,3295,Wow thats great news! Only a week is only 3 games..2 weeks is 7....
767455,BillM,2013-02-13 02:28:00,17367,Yeah but a concussion is a completely different realm..  He'll be back!
767459,jedimaster,2013-02-13 02:44:00,3472,I believe he had an upper body injury..  now he has a lower body injury..  so that could be a stubbed tow or an amputation above the knee. My enthusiasm is also tempered.
767675,kickingfrog,2013-02-14 01:53:00,8333,Can't believe more guys don't wear the kevlar socks and shirts.
767681,jedimaster,2013-02-14 02:04:00,3472,"Yikes, that sucks, he has been playing great. Frattin is also out... My hockey pool has been pillaged this week."
767688,danc,2013-02-14 02:27:00,4677,"I've been enjoying the Leafs game this year, and especially this past week. They seem to have it all finally. Size, speed, goaltending. But there's one thing that drives me crazy when watching the Leafs games. The play by play caller, no matter who it is, always says Clarke MacArthur,  not just MacArthur. 80% of the time at least. An example would be, Phaneuf over to Kessel, back to Bozak, tipped over to Clarke MacArthur. They hardly ever call him by just his last name. If you haven't noticed this, you will next game, and it will drive you crazy. lol Clarke MacArthur, Clarke MacArthur, Clarke MacArthur. That's all you'll hear all night long. Saturday night at home to the Sens. Tell me what happens because I'll be watching the NASCAR Sprint Unlimited. But I will change channels and catch coaches corner."
767693,kickingfrog,2013-02-14 02:40:00,8333,"Achilles surgery for Karlsson. As someone who snapped his, that reaction and facial expression told me everything I needed to know."
767695,tb4me,2013-02-14 02:44:00,3295,Ya thats going to be a good night for sure! Go Leafs Go ! I would also like to see the 78 Furniture Row car win!
767696,tb4me,2013-02-14 02:46:00,3295,Ouch just seen the Karlson- Cooke incident..Wow Im not a Sens fan but I do feel bad for them. Its been a season of hard knocks for that team...
767702,danc,2013-02-14 03:00:00,4677,Ouch. And I thought snapping my pelvis into 3  was bad.
767721,BillM,2013-02-14 04:13:00,17367, I still love Bob even if he gets a few calls wrong    I'd still like to see him and Neale back in action.   Best pair of announcers to ever hit the CBC.
767723,kickingfrog,2013-02-14 04:15:00,8333,I wouldn't want any part of that.
767726,kickingfrog,2013-02-14 04:18:00,8333,"I love Bob as well, but it's sad to hear him now. It is time for him step back. He really doesn't know what is happening much of the time."
767770,jedimaster,2013-02-14 14:16:00,3472,"So that means if you buy tickets off of someone for a leafs sens game they can cancel them at the door? That is messed up, its legal to sell tickets as long as there is no profit. Thats why they are sold for face value plus a service charge. There is something that feels illegal about that."
767771,Jigger,2013-02-14 14:16:00,1237,"Gonna be pretty quiet on Saturday if thats the case. Could always wear a jacket over a Leafs jersey going through the turnstiles, thatll learn em!"

They still have tonnes of seats for sale even for the leafs sens game next weekend. I can get lower bowl pairs row G for 200 a pop. Same price I could sell my rangers tickets for."
767794,DRIFTER_016,2013-02-14 15:45:00,10439,"HAHAHA!!!!!! Silly SENS Fans, TIX ARE FOR LEAF FANS!!!! Too funny!!! I can hear how this went in the Sens boardroom.  ""Gentlemen we have a problem!! There are too many leafs fans in our building and we need to do something about it!!

767097,jedimaster,2013-02-12 00:39:00,3472,HOLY CRAP WHAT A SAVE....
767107,BillM,2013-02-12 00:55:00,17367,Rough start but at least they tied it up and have been pretty much in control for the last half of the 1st period.  Nice to see Dion with the lazer.
767112,Jigger,2013-02-12 00:59:00,1237,The Leafs looked a little sloppy from this seat. They were pretty Reimer to sneak out of the first tied... Komarov is a gem

767135,jedimaster,2013-02-12 01:18:00,3472,"Kadri tipped that third goal, and a great assist on this one.... Bryzzy gettin the hook. Loving it. I hope Riemer just tweaked and did injure anything."

767142,Jigger,2013-02-12 01:28:00,1237,Hes given them a shot every night. Hopefully Scrivens realizes the Chance he has.
767143,Jigger,2013-02-12 01:28:00,1237,Have no problem with this. For the right price.
767149,tb4me,2013-02-12 01:33:00,3295,Looks brutal but ya he is...lol  in Ben we trust

766715,jedimaster,2013-02-10 16:58:00,3472,Did you guys see the replay of the penalty in the Minnesota  game in overtime? This hand on the puck business has officially gone too far.
766722,jedimaster,2013-02-10 17:30:00,3472,Here is the penalty... Oh yah this was in overtime... I would have been fuming. That is such a stupic call.  
766738,jedimaster,2013-02-10 18:32:00,3472,They ended up losing the game in ot on that penalty kill. Clearly incidental contact with the hand. There has to be some level discretion with these hand on puck penalties.
766744,BillM,2013-02-10 18:49:00,17367,"That's a brutal call, you've gotta be kidding me."
766757,tb4me,2013-02-10 19:43:00,3295,Wow I didnt see that penalty..Thanks for posting it..Thats the worst call of them all yet..Dont get me wrong the one the other night where the Ref called JVR for hand on the puck in the corner when it was clearly 3 to 4 feet away from was bad enough. But this one here cost an OT game..brutal...
766760,tb4me,2013-02-10 19:48:00,3295,"#Leafs Grabovski to have hearing over 'biting' incident with #Canadiens Pacioretty: http://bit.ly/WCL5eA  #NHLTypical Habs player..Sticks his arm on the open mouth of Grabs and squeezes, wouldnt the teeth naturally dig into his skin? Brutal the real victim is Grabovski here..Maybe Pacioretty should call the police on Grabs like he did to Chara...Sickening"

I do not,  nor will I ever have an allegiance to a hockey team and/or any other professional sports team for that matter. Unless they pay me to wear their colors and cheer them on, they frankly ain't worth my time. Daughters' playoff game is at 5pm today if anyone is interested in absorbing the true essence of sport.

766943,jedimaster,2013-02-11 19:01:00,3472,"I would agree, however, I would also have agreed if they did suspend him. I think its pretty clear that there was some wort of bite, but I think that he was really left with no choice, with being choked out from behind with a forearm in his mouth while he was engaging another player. IMO Pax got what he deserved and I think he is a snivelling little weasle and he better be careful or someone is gonna run him out of the rink again."

On the same note,the next game could be completely different. A leaf fan is not easy a lot of the time. lolol."

766414,tb4me,2013-02-09 02:00:00,3295,Well I for one could care less if they dont win a cup.. I enjoy hockey and I love the Leafs..  have my whole life.. This will never change.. Go Leafs Go.. I dont even care if Ottawa or Montreal win it before my leafs do..
766428,moxie,2013-02-09 03:06:00,1566,"Hockey Sinny.... Hockey...Montreal has won a cup in every decade except the last one. The leafs are a sad sack of S#!t and aren't worth the paper the Game Program is written on and until they are Y""all are just whistlin dixie. leaf fans haven't had a leg to stand on for almost half a century so try preachin to someone who don't know the game cause as far as I'm concerned they ain't got any. Game that is........Notice I don't use capital letters when referring to leaf fans? Haven't earned it..... hehehe. I love this....."
766437,muskymatt,2013-02-09 03:54:00,2608, Awesome simply awesome  The laffs are sad sack Bwahaha  That was so beautiful it almost brought a tear to my eye.  Kessel scores a goal and the parade is back on  Bwahaha 
766476,muskymike,2013-02-09 15:29:00,772,"I leave for 8 months or so, and this is what I come back to. Should have figured Muskymatt would be all over this. haha.  I wish we got AM640 out here, instead of the Team1200. Apparently Erik Karlsson is the best player in the league (yes, better than any other player) at least thats what the Ottawa media says, and his coach.  Pot - Stirred"
766478,muskymatt,2013-02-09 15:45:00,2608," I'd like to see anyone dispute Karlsson as the best player in the league, he can do it all and drive the tempo of the game at the same time. His take away from Stal said it all. The guy is a machine, plays over 30 minutes a game and all at 175lbs. Incredible!!!!! He is the ideal player to build a winning team around. Kind of the anti phanuf Lolol "
766489,Chance,2013-02-09 16:55:00,420," 18th in gaols,104th in assists and 42nd in points. Strange stats for the best player in the league."
766494,muskymatt,2013-02-09 17:41:00,2608, a stats guy eh? also a laff fan? When pretty much anybody in the league would agree that he is the tops and teams dfence actually practice drills to contain him. I think there is some credibility to that claim.  And as a defenceman he has more points that the any laff player.
766495,Jigger,2013-02-09 17:57:00,1237,Kadri has same point total
766496,Chance,2013-02-09 18:06:00,420,"mmmm  yeah thats how a winner is decided,the most points wins. Who in the league says he is the best player ?? All teams run drills addressing players and systems from each and every team. Might be new to you but that is how it has been done since the league began. As far as having more points than any Leaf player...nice attempt at avoiding the question. Have another whirl and tell us how he is the BEST player in the league , betcha cant , now THAT is funny !"
766497,Chance,2013-02-09 18:08:00,420,Dont worry that too shall go over his head. The fact that the Sens are a couple of points ahead of the Leafs has also  slipped by.
766547,moxie,2013-02-09 22:33:00,1566,hehehe. It's so much fun pickin on leafers cause they just keep gettin back up and askin for more...

766606,tb4me,2013-02-10 01:55:00,3295,lol 4-0 Leafs..Habs suck..brutal team ya all got there Montreal....Kessel with his 2nd

766650,jedimaster,2013-02-10 05:08:00,3472,"Teall yah what... If the Leafs meet the Sens or Habs this year in the playoffs, I'll arrange an all Leafs OFC fish fry... Just for scale on the picture... the top one is 14 inches with the busted up tail and 12.5 inch girth.  BYOF"
765599,jedimaster,2013-02-06 01:00:00,3472,Jvr has a pair of nice goals so far tonight. Leafs up 2-1 end of first. Nice steal from behind the net and a wrap around and another dirty bang in goal.
765600,tb4me,2013-02-06 01:00:00,3295,"We still need a #1 centre, sorry but Bozak is a 2nd or 3rd line centre at best..I like Bozak but he isint the go to guy on any other team...I say Phaneuf and Kadri for Getzlaf or the likes...."
765601,tb4me,2013-02-06 01:02:00,3295,"Yes he has been a nice addition, thanks Mr. Burke"
765612,jedimaster,2013-02-06 01:35:00,3472,I don't know if I would want to get rid of kadri. Every time he has the puck he is pressing the net for a goal.
766127,jedimaster,2013-02-08 02:14:00,3472,great hustle by bozak
766131,moxie,2013-02-08 02:21:00,1566,Another blacked out game for the die-hards. I really like the way they thank y'all for your patronage and steadfast support after the half century sham.
766132,tb4me,2013-02-08 02:28:00,3295,Blacked out? Where do you live..it shouldnt be..Leafs tv

766222,tb4me,2013-02-08 16:01:00,3295,"Yes we all pay to watch tv..Leafs tv is only another 3 bucks a month, to follow every little detail of my team..Thats not a black out."
766224,jedimaster,2013-02-08 16:07:00,3472,"I have had Leafs tv every year, but not this year. I'll still watch the leafs tv games though."

Woke up one day and what do I see, payin way too much for crappy TV Hop in the truck and took a drive you see, gonna try and make it so it works for me. Talked to a man with plenty to say, ended up talkin me into an HD-8Bay. Up on the roof when I hear the neighbor say, Heard a lot of talk bout those big 8 bays. Told m I was tired of ole Rogers and Bell, Now I got my 8 bay and they can go to hell.  Its' a work in progress and it  sucks but then again so do those Monopolizing Media Black Holes."
766231,capt bruce,2013-02-08 16:26:00,820,  NO!!!!!
766233,Chance,2013-02-08 16:31:00,420,Oh I am sure there are all other sorts and means of watching TV but my point being the ones who complain about purchasing Leafs TV are usually the ones paying for cable to watch their team of choice.
766243,tb4me,2013-02-08 16:56:00,3295,With antenas you dont get all the Rogers channels or tsn 2. so why complain about leafs tv? lol
766252,moxie,2013-02-08 17:13:00,1566,"The connected generations don't have a clue because their heads are always pointed in the downward direction. Other than the electricity flowin through the cord TV used to be free and still can be. Of the 900 channels on any network how much repetition and reality crap (Which is as scripted as the day is long) is there? News, Reality and more crap than you can shake a stick at.. $70/Month for filler? $70/Month for dead air? And if you're watching leaf games for an extra $3 a month you are paying $3 too much. hehehe."
766256,Chance,2013-02-08 17:21:00,420,Red ? Red Green is that really you ?
766310,tb4me,2013-02-08 20:23:00,3295,"lol funny..The point was that the leafs game was ""blacked out"" well if you have the new digital antenna you wouldn't get RSN or TSN 2 with the best reception. So having said that all games would be blacked out that weren't on CBC or tsn.. I'm not even sure you would get regular TSN on those systems. So to say the games on Leafs Tv are blacked out is a mute point with a digital antenna You most likely would only get to watch Saturday night hockey on CBC.."
766367,moxie,2013-02-08 22:51:00,1566,"  hehehe. That would be fair comment if I were a leaf fan . In a nut shell? You'd best be saving your collective breaths and find better things to do until they win a cup(If they ever do). Then and only then do they deserve to have any deserved attention cast their way. Those two behemoths that own them are laughing at you all because win or lose they own you. Hell, I can only imagine how many of you watch their shameful product on a 3"" screen. hehehe."

764200,tb4me,2013-01-31 22:53:00,3295,I like this move..Muskymatt is ok we play you real soon..Your soon to see why we need the tough guys. Praise Alfie..lol Go Leafs Go!!!
764206,davey buoy,2013-01-31 23:02:00,5505,Now if the leafs could get some tough guys that can also play like the Bruins tough guys do. That would be a heck of a team.
764227,tb4me,2013-02-01 00:31:00,3295,Good game so far..Nice goal by JVR.. Ovie looks asleep doesnt he..Will see how long this lasts
764246,tb4me,2013-02-01 01:18:00,3295,What makes you ask that? lol I have no idea thou
764273,DRIFTER_016,2013-02-01 02:14:00,10439,WOOHOO!!! Lulumon ties it up!!!  And then Frattin puts us in the lead!!!
764277,tb4me,2013-02-01 02:19:00,3295,Wow what a comeback! Way to gut it out Kuli and Kadri wow what effort on that rush..Reimer once again is Da MAN!!!
764342,jedimaster,2013-02-01 15:28:00,3472,Kadri and jvr had great games. Reimer looked solid but yet another goal through the wickets.
764361,tb4me,2013-02-01 16:32:00,3295,Yes he did let one soft one thru.. As long as he lets less then the other teams goalie I suppose he will be just fine. Other then that id be happy to say he has stolen both games from the Pens Sabers and the Caps. Go Leafs GO.
764558,davey buoy,2013-02-02 13:09:00,5505,Tonights game has the makings of being a rough one. Go Leafs Go!!!!!!!!!
764649,tb4me,2013-02-02 19:01:00,3295,Its gonna be a beauty! Mclearen is in the lineup watch out lucih and chara...lol Reimer starts too..Thank god the Scrivens esperiment is finally over..I cringe when I think of the points that experiment cost us leafers....3 games is 6 points....
764828,jedimaster,2013-02-03 03:06:00,3472,That was a tough one. Reimer played awesome.
764835,muskymatt,2013-02-03 03:38:00,2608,Man that was a great game! Boston is  team# 11 (Alfies #) (PraiseALFIE) of my 29 favorite NHL teams. Go Bruins! LoL
764856,Jigger,2013-02-03 06:13:00,1237,"what does that even mean? OH, because Alfredsson...whatever...  The Bruins played a great defensive game. Leafs came close, IMO Fransons goal should've counted. Kadri was clearly pushed into Rask. Reimer is starting to look like a goalie I could trust."
764920,tb4me,2013-02-03 17:42:00,3295,I dont pay attention to him..Lol I find it funny myself. Yes Reimer looks great out there. For the first time since his rookie year I dont cringe every time the other team brings the puck into our end. I actually cant wait to play the sens..Go Leafs go!
764922,jedimaster,2013-02-03 17:47:00,3472,Lets see how reimer does. Hopefully he pans out. Looks like vancouver needs luongo anyway. Haha.
765290,jedimaster,2013-02-05 00:49:00,3472,Someone tell phaneuf that point shots are supposed to be kept low and on the net.
765308,jedimaster,2013-02-05 01:23:00,3472,"OMG, phaneuf what the heck dude you are even putting th refs out.."
765336,DRIFTER_016,2013-02-05 02:36:00,10439,We need to knock a few more refs teeth out me thinks.
765337,muskymatt,2013-02-05 02:41:00,2608,"A ref just took a puck to  the head in the Dallas game. Sounds like not a great night for the reffs, or the laffs for that matter lol. The Canes are team# 18 of my 29 favorite teams.  LoL  go canes go !!!!!!!!"
765412,jedimaster,2013-02-05 14:44:00,3472, x2  on a side note I hear Bozak is getting calls from Arsenal to play soccer next season.  What a brutal bunch of calls.
765426,muskymatt,2013-02-05 15:15:00,2608," Sens are not 5-4-1, they are 5-3-1 (praise ALFIE) about to be 6-3-1 while the laffs  will go 4-7-0 . Lets be more accurate here lolol"
765436,muskymatt,2013-02-05 15:51:00,2608,"Classic laffs moment as far as I'm concerned.  LOLOL  last time I saw a play that bad was during my daughters first year  of  atom lolol  If I was a laffs fan, I'd be pretty embarrassed.  Oh wait, the fans were booing the laffs.  Get the paper bags out Bwahaha"
765438,BillM,2013-02-05 16:00:00,17367," You try way to hard man, lol!!!!"
765496,davey buoy,2013-02-05 20:09:00,5505,"I won't  jump off the band wagon,but This team is along way still from making the playoffs IMO.It's early,but something just goes out of wack at the wrong time?.What will they do?"
762930,muskymatt,2013-01-27 12:23:00,2608,"kadri does look good so far, I'll give them that."
763599,jedimaster,2013-01-30 00:24:00,3472,"Great shot by kadri rings the crossbar and the rebound got pumped in. Great presure by kulemin, great shot by kadri. Mclement banged it in... btw the game is on leafstv"
763603,Guest,2013-01-30 00:30:00,0,Got to credit Kulemin for that goal.  Hes gonna bounce back this year.
763606,jedimaster,2013-01-30 00:33:00,3472,"Kulemin is my underdog in the hockey pool. He hustled good on that one. He has been playing well this year, he will get his shots this year I think. OH man komorov fanned on a good chance there. Dang, that was not a good goal. Riemer had time to get up he was too deep and that puck should have been iced."
763621,Guest,2013-01-30 01:04:00,0,Lets just hope they step it up in the second.  If they are 2-4 after this game im going to be pissed.
763622,jedimaster,2013-01-30 01:10:00,3472,uh oh
763623,irishfield,2013-01-30 01:12:00,26272,Now there's some regular Leaf's vocabulary !!
763644,jedimaster,2013-01-30 02:20:00,3472,"haha, even though the leafs are competing much better this year they still get stuck in those sequences wher eyou just know somethign bad is gonna happen. When I played hockey my dad always said he wished he could put a radio in my helmet so he could tell me whats happening on the ice. The leafs need to invest in some of that technology. haha. good game so far though very entertaining.  The goals have looked weak but reimer has made some great stops. If he ever figures out that open legs are for girls on the street he will be a great goalie."
763646,Guest,2013-01-30 02:29:00,0,"Too funny.  Your absolutly right cause I knew something was coming too.  It seems to be a regular thing for the leafs lately.  Kessel reminds me of myself when I used to play.  I had so many chances, but I couldnt put the puck in the net."
763647,tb4me,2013-01-30 02:29:00,3295,"I have enjoyed this game so far..Its to bad about loosing Brown tonight. He served Leaf Nation Well tonight. I also think Reimer is having a good game so farJonas Siegel‏@jonasTSN1050 Mike Brown did not return for the third period, following second period fight with Mike Weber."
763651,Christopheraaron,2013-01-30 02:49:00,3525,That was a great ending!
763653,tb4me,2013-01-30 02:54:00,3295,Wow Fratten with 3 goals in 2 games .. Impressive Reimer had a great game..Cant stop em all..He beat Miller tonight..SO he has beaten Miller and Fleury this year Good game boys...
763655,Guest,2013-01-30 03:01:00,0,Buffalo still got a point.  Like in the past the leafs will be battling them for those last few playoff spots so they need every point.  Nice goal anyways for Frattin.
763775,jedimaster,2013-01-30 16:13:00,3472,"Brown left with an upper body injury, He has been playing well and no arguing what Fratting has been doing. Kadri with another solid game and Reimer played well but the goal he let in were a bit squeeky. However he did come up with some big saves so can't really complaign."
764158,jedimaster,2013-01-31 21:30:00,3472,"PIcked up a new guy off waivers, 6'5"" 250 pound AHL'r from San Jose. Never heard of him. Anyone know anything about him? Frazer McLaren"
764161,jedimaster,2013-01-31 21:37:00,3472,Ahh ok I see 
764162,jedimaster,2013-01-31 21:39:00,3472,
764164,misfish,2013-01-31 21:45:00,29133,"That pick up,should give Orr more time to score goals.LOL"
764170,davey buoy,2013-01-31 21:51:00,5505,"Why more heavy weights?,what about a centre,and maybe a veteran goalie to cap off this team.Not asking for much,but how much more punch do we need?.I'll be watching tonight as always.OV is in town.Should be exciting!!!!!!!!"
764177,jedimaster,2013-01-31 22:02:00,3472,"Honeslty I think Orr is done, and Brown is hurt. I say line up the leaf end to end with 6'5"" + guys and have at her. I mean they don't even need to dress with hockey gloves. It'll save some cash for new teeth. He isn't reporting until friday btw. I like the idea of a 700 pound 4th line."
764180,DRIFTER_016,2013-01-31 22:04:00,10439,He was picked up to fill in for the injured Brown. Toughness is good.............. MKAY!!!
764181,muskymatt,2013-01-31 22:05:00,2608," Because that's the type of goon hockey the laffs give their fans.  That's why they haven't made the playoffs in 9 years or had a cup in almost 50 yrs.  The laffs are sitting in 16th place without a #1 center or goalie, yet they get goons. The Sens (PRAISE ALFIE) are in 4th place and have so much depth it's crazy. The Sens dismantled the Habs last night without Spezza or Gonchar in the lineup."
764185,davey buoy,2013-01-31 22:10:00,5505,"LOL,I guess the more penalties we can get the better the goalies will be. Still need a centre."
764186,jedimaster,2013-01-31 22:13:00,3472,"Biggest (average weight): Washington (209.5), Kings (209.3), Ottawa (208.1), San Jose (207.5), Phoenix (207.0).  Leafs are now tipping 206.5 depending on  who fills in for the injured folks.."
764187,davey buoy,2013-01-31 22:14:00,5505,"All kidding aside,they may just catch up to the leafs the way the leafs have been the last while.Can't see any real change.I know it's early."
762336,Christopheraaron,2013-01-25 01:40:00,3525,"It's a new game, as long as they don't screw up too bad we'll be ok"
762345,Christopheraaron,2013-01-25 02:05:00,3525,Remind me why scrivens was in there in the first place?
762346,tb4me,2013-01-25 02:05:00,3295,lol thank god the scrivens experiment is over
762351,Christopheraaron,2013-01-25 02:21:00,3525,Who comes after reimer?  :wallbash:
762354,jedimaster,2013-01-25 02:28:00,3472,Luongo
762358,Christopheraaron,2013-01-25 02:35:00,3525,Luongo would've played worse then that empty net
762359,jedimaster,2013-01-25 02:39:00,3472,"Honestly, I think luongo is better than either of these two guys, and I think vancouver is nervous about having schnieder without having luongo. He is not the best goalie but he is a top 10 goalie in the league. The leafs have two good backups. Thats two in the top 40. I am not saying he is gonna win everygame, but he doesn't let in all 6 of those tonight."
762366,Christopheraaron,2013-01-25 03:14:00,3525,Are we already forgetting about game one?
762397,misfish,2013-01-25 11:42:00,29133,Now thats the leafs we know and love. LOL
762412,jedimaster,2013-01-25 13:11:00,3472,He was out in a pretty crappy situation there. Pretty tough to be motivated when your gm and coach said your are out next time you lose. No different the leafs are far away from winning a cup with any goalie. They won't tank and collect some number ones. They have a young goalie with promise that's not ready to be a number one. They have players that need to see the playoffs to gain experience. Luongo gets them into the playoffs and help develope reimer or scrivens.
762447,jedimaster,2013-01-25 15:23:00,3472,I was a bit surprised to see scrivens in net. You gotta pick one guy and ride him out for the duration. They are both young and unproven. swaping back and fourth is useless.
762449,davey buoy,2013-01-25 15:26:00,5505,"As said a hundred times,I agree ,they need a veteran goalie to steal the game for you on tough nights. Don't mean to repeat!."
762467,misfish,2013-01-25 16:46:00,29133,"Strap the pads on Davey. LOL  The big surprise was after the third goal,they looked like they just gave up.  Sure it could of been a blow out in the first,if Kessel would of netted 2 or 3 of his 10 chances.  Kadri looked really good again. Positive for the leafs."
762519,davey buoy,2013-01-25 18:52:00,5505,"Gotta love them Brian,the more things change ,the more they stay the same.Having said that,when's the next game? lol. Go Leafs Go!!!!"
762542,DRIFTER_016,2013-01-25 20:06:00,10439,  Saturday night. And it's on CBC so no complaining until Tuesday nights game on Leafs TV.
762613,jedimaster,2013-01-26 00:11:00,3472,Gardiner sent packin to the marlies...
762614,misfish,2013-01-26 00:12:00,29133,Ya heard that. WHY? Been doing great IMO
762641,DRIFTER_016,2013-01-26 01:25:00,10439," Exactly, I think he's a little out of game shape after the injury is all. A little conditioning and he will be back."
762835,Christopheraaron,2013-01-26 23:27:00,3525,Any guesses on who will take it tonight?
762839,davey buoy,2013-01-26 23:30:00,5505,"Leafs,if you mean win?"
762853,Christopheraaron,2013-01-27 00:22:00,3525,"LOL, looks like we'll be treated to a good game, 2 fights already!"
762854,davey buoy,2013-01-27 00:23:00,5505,Didn't take long did it?
762855,Christopheraaron,2013-01-27 00:26:00,3525,I think that was one of our best goals yet
762904,muskymatt,2013-01-27 04:11:00,2608,"Hmmm  Its now 11:10 pm, last post was 7:26 pm. Me thinks things went bad for the laffs. I'll have to go check the scores"
762923,Guest,2013-01-27 10:49:00,0,"Here we go again.  I know the leafs arent going to make the playoffs so im not falling for that again, but im more interested on the progress of Kadri, Gardnier, and JVR.  Lets hope these guys produce some decent numbers this year."
762202,jedimaster,2013-01-24 19:29:00,3472,"It is funny, and is clearly a mistake. I would think Dennis should be omited from both stats, but harding should definatly be included. Likely a 10 percent of games played limitation or something like that.  Never really thought about but it should be something. 1 game, or 10 games or a percentage of games etc..."
762205,davey buoy,2013-01-24 19:41:00,5505,"Great start so far,as said he is there for a reason,and what a good reason,players know he's out there .That works,gives the Leafs a bit of a edge.I hope it's not his last year."
762206,DRIFTER_016,2013-01-24 19:44:00,10439,Frattin was recalled from the Marlies to replace Lupul.
762214,jedimaster,2013-01-24 21:00:00,3472,"Yah I saw that, I wonder what the lines will be, game is on leafs tv. BOO!!!"
762216,davey buoy,2013-01-24 21:03:00,5505,"Sorry my friend,I have it!! lol."

762223,jedimaster,2013-01-24 21:11:00,3472,"little bit miffed about that. I have bought leafs tv in the past, but will not be doing so this year.... even though I managed to get tickets for when the rangers come to town in april."
762227,Thrilla,2013-01-24 21:14:00,164,"yup ditched Leafstv along with Bell  a couple years ago, great deal to begin with @ 1$/month Couple years down the road it was 3$/month, Bell somehow increased the prices for me little bits at a time... Didn't think much of it at first, thought maybe the prices were just going up but after a couple years I was paying near double what I started at (NOT JUST LEAFS TV THE WHOLE BILL)  Now having said that I wish I still had it, sucks that I have to miss the game tonight..."
762233,capt bruce,2013-01-24 21:36:00,820,"I'm with Sinc , you rip us off for half a season and now I cant watch the few games you are playing on cbc etc.   Leafs"" tv ""did they chop the price in half ??? damn , Baseball on the radio I grew up with ,and really when cutting the grass , chilling in the yard etc. haveing a baseball game on the radio ,NO problem ... HOCKEY is a sport that is made for viewing ... We all should have boycotted this season ,As much as I wanted too ,  watching last nights game , major wood ... Tonight a rob . One free game for a few fans and now they get a few dollars FROM EVERYONE with leafs TV , how many more of the few games they will play will they do this too???... SAD but I love the leafs and I will and have put up with this for , WHAT 8-9 years...paid the fare didnt get a ride ...."
762234,davey buoy,2013-01-24 21:41:00,5505,"Bruce,looks like every four days or so.It sucks but out of our hands.Probably still get it on the radio.What can we do?"

This boycott does not include watching the game on Leafs TV that someone else has subscribed to, or bars if someone calls and wants to head to a watering hole."
762253,tb4me,2013-01-24 23:06:00,3295,You dont need leafs tv for the game tonight. Lots of streaming links avaiable onling for tonights game. Start with Justin tv and go from there

762294,jedimaster,2013-01-25 00:15:00,3472,good hockey play with bozak charging to the goal. Gunnarson isin my fantasy pool too. haha
762301,Christopheraaron,2013-01-25 00:36:00,3525,That was nice!
762306,jedimaster,2013-01-25 00:46:00,3472,"Great play so far, can't blame scrivens for that goal, and really not even Phaneuf bouncing puck is a bouncing puck tought to control those. Happy leafs fan here."
762309,tb4me,2013-01-25 00:50:00,3295,"Good 1st.. Grabos shot was nice..Kadri, has been incredible to watch..The kid has puck drive like I havent seen in a long time..He even races to touch the puck after the whistle. Funny"
762310,jedimaster,2013-01-25 00:54:00,3472,"He is hungry for the puck, but also very willing to pass. Great to see. I have been dying to see him get a real shot in the NHL. He is gonna be great."
762320,DRIFTER_016,2013-01-25 01:13:00,10439,That beautiful piece of defending by Liles brought a tear to my eye.
762323,tb4me,2013-01-25 01:20:00,3295,lol me too...
762328,jedimaster,2013-01-25 01:28:00,3472,"getting sloppy, turn overs before the red line are killing them"
761978,Christopheraaron,2013-01-24 01:17:00,3525,Finally JVR! Not a great goal but good positioning
761979,tb4me,2013-01-24 01:19:00,3295,"Wow what a game! This is awesome..Reimer WOW, JVR with a greasy goal..But Kadri..lol Macarthur didnt even know it went off his stick. That was Kadris vision that put that in..Ahh crap, Crosby"
761980,jedimaster,2013-01-24 01:20:00,3472,Good goal by jvr head to the net and bang em in. That the kind of play jvr was brought here for. Great defense by the leafs so far this. Becoming a carlyle believer.... hahah as I type this crosby pots one. Grabo bad cough. Reimer mot looking so great but malkin and crosby scored so what can you do.
761981,jedimaster,2013-01-24 01:25:00,3472,That did not look good for lupal. But kadri wow. Has drawn both of those penalties.
761982,Christopheraaron,2013-01-24 01:31:00,3525,"It didn't look like it felt good but i don't think he got hurt too bad, maybe a bruise."
761984,tb4me,2013-01-24 01:33:00,3295,It looked like a slash from orpic after the shot to me.. He most likely wont be back..Ouch
761985,tb4me,2013-01-24 01:34:00,3295,JVR with his 2nd of th enight..Good game for him..
761986,jedimaster,2013-01-24 01:34:00,3472,Oh man there was clarke snapper from jvr.
761990,jedimaster,2013-01-24 01:44:00,3472,Komisarik was out for 8 weeks with a broken arm on a shot block. Hopefully lupe isn't out for that long. Sounded bad though from the quick update.
762000,jedimaster,2013-01-24 02:13:00,3472,Komorov is playing tough hockey and jvr has a 3 point night.
762004,tb4me,2013-01-24 02:30:00,3295,Good game so far..Im a happy Leafer tonight! Grabo with a nice goal..Too bad about Lupal
762007,jedimaster,2013-01-24 02:39:00,3472,Haha baby crosby misconduct. 2 minutes for crying.
762008,Christopheraaron,2013-01-24 02:40:00,3525,That was nice!
762010,DRIFTER_016,2013-01-24 02:42:00,10439,Good game lads!!!
762012,jedimaster,2013-01-24 02:44:00,3472,"Wow great game. Solid defense, great pressure forechecking. Can't complain about anything accept for lupe's injury... and heck we all get some eyecandy to follow up the win."
762022,tb4me,2013-01-24 02:52:00,3295,Great game..We were out shot 31 to 22 reimer faced way better scoring chances then Scrivens did in any of those 2 games. Go Leafs Go!
762099,jedimaster,2013-01-24 13:25:00,3472,Fractured / broken arm for lupal. Out 6-8 weeks is the reports I am hearing. I think there will be a team doctor press release today  usually they need to re xray it the day after and make a plan if the are going to pin it or  just set it. That sucks.
762113,Christopheraaron,2013-01-24 14:30:00,3525,"That really sucks, hopefully he pulls a pujols on us"
762180,Christopheraaron,2013-01-24 18:28:00,3525,"brodeur and anderson have played 2 games and have only let in one goal (1/2=0.5) and the 1.000 guys have both got shutouts, not sure what's confusing"
762184,Christopheraaron,2013-01-24 18:32:00,3525,"oh, ya that is weird. Didn't make the connection."
762190,jedimaster,2013-01-24 19:02:00,3472,Unless the two guys didn't play a full game. I think for it to count for GAA you need to have played a full game. My guess is those two goalies with a 1.00 Save percentage played half a period or some such thing. Otherwise a backup will almost always be the GAA leader.
762192,jedimaster,2013-01-24 19:07:00,3472,as I thought... 
762193,jedimaster,2013-01-24 19:07:00,3472,not sure on harding
762195,jedimaster,2013-01-24 19:13:00,3472,If you list all the goalies and sort by save GAA he is on top... they probably have a all goalies with a GAA > 0 sort ascending in the code where they should have an all goalies with games > 0 sort by GAA ascending  I think they are trying to limit goalies that only played part of a game or a couple games from being the GAA and save percentage leaders. I mean if brodier gets knocked out with injury for the rest of the season should be the league leading GAA at the end of the year? there has to be some min number of games required.  http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/statistics/?show=goalie&sortcol=7&sortdir=desc&prefilter=0-0&prefilter=2-1
762199,jedimaster,2013-01-24 19:19:00,3472,"Thats what I am saying there is likely a code problem in there top 5 listing, if you click the link I sent you can sort by GAA and they are on top.  Yahoo sports indicates a 1 game minimum but again he is listed as not being top GAA> there code is also broken. If you select all players versus qualified leaders then it it different. i believe if memory serves me right as time goes on the minimum number of req games to be considered for GAA leader increases depending on what stat location you look at.  http://sports.yahoo.com/nhl/stats/bycategory?cat=Goaltending&sort=111&qualified=1&conference=NHL&year=season_2012  If you look at NHL.com it has yan dennis and harding on the list of top GAA, with no 1 game minimum http://www.nhl.com/ice/statshome.htm#?navid=nav-sts-league  TSN and Yahoo sports both have flaws in there code. Don't worry the next time each of those goalies start it will be fixed.  haha"
761450,jedimaster,2013-01-22 02:58:00,3472,Scores tie game.  Ahhhhhh dang... great hustle by kadri
761453,Christopheraaron,2013-01-22 03:04:00,3525,You put any other goalie in and we had it   Still all in all a good game.
761454,Guest,2013-01-22 03:05:00,0,Millers the reason why I stopped going to Buffalo to watch the leafs play.  It sucks when everyone jumps up and im the only one sitting down.
761455,jedimaster,2013-01-22 03:14:00,3472,"Wow Miller is freakin amazing. I gotta say though that goal from Kadri shows this kid wants the puck. great hustle. It felt like his minutes were down today. get him on the ice on the power play a bit more.  They did a good job on the PP even though they didn't score til Kadri's, they had a couple good chances each PP."
761506,Jigger,2013-01-22 14:04:00,1237,"Cant say the buds didnt give it their best shot last night. Miller was insane! Looks to be a team on the upswing. Cant say i disagree with you Sinclair, Kadri sure has a nose for the net. Once JVR can skate properly that line's going to put up some good points!"
761540,jedimaster,2013-01-22 16:56:00,3472,"Well it looks like luongo is on the move. No really. go to tsn http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/ sounds like its just waiting for the player notifications you have been traded tlaks to happen. What do you think? Leafs or somewhere else? I am sure it has to be the leafs. I don't think they can afford to not take make the move. I mean there are ups and downs to any deal for luongo, but if he goes somewhere else and the leafs miss the playoffs again Nonis will not be long for a job in toronto. I guess he is saying its not the Leafs, but who would it be? Tampa, Chic, Edmonton, Philly? Maybe philly is waiting to deal bryzgelof"
761552,jedimaster,2013-01-22 17:44:00,3472,"Thats the big q, who are the waiting for? Is it a player to come back healthy, is it a player that need to be bought out by a team..(Bryzgelof), Is it a player that needs ot be traded, sent down etc... He isn't really giving much to go one, but yah sounds like he is pointing fingers at gardiner."
761560,tb4me,2013-01-22 18:00:00,3295,Coach interview after practice today and after addressing Connolly and Lombardi moves he mentions something briefly about a little birdie telling him they have another announcement later this afternoon.So either Gardiner is cleared to play or he has been traded for Louongo...Wich one is it
761607,davey buoy,2013-01-22 20:42:00,5505,"We will have to wait and see. I liked Gardiner,Let's hope they get someone descent for him!!!!,Any one know the time of the announcement?"
761610,misfish,2013-01-22 20:48:00,29133,"How about they get a good PP line. Like come on.5 on 3 for over 4 minutes and nothing to show. Shoot the dam puck boys. Get in front of the net,not beside it. Shhhhheeeeecccchhhh."
761611,solopaddler,2013-01-22 20:49:00,8605,"There is zero chance Gardiner will be traded unless it's for another promising young player. Nonis said as much last week.  Vancouver needs a center anyway, not a defenseman.  After getting rid of Lombardi and Connely there's no way the Leafs are going to gut themselves at center by trading Bozak or Kadri.  I like Luongo and think he'd help the team, but only at the right price and that's not likely happening."
761621,Jigger,2013-01-22 21:30:00,1237,"If you read between the lines, Gillis pretty much said it wasnt the Leafs. I think Gards might suit up this week."
761635,jedimaster,2013-01-22 22:22:00,3472,"They changed up the lines at practise, and it sounds like gardiner is ready so someone has to get sent down or traded. The gardiner deal I heard was one van was interested in as they wanted to bundle some of there D men to go for a center. But yah they do need a center. JVR and Mcarthur changed spots  so it'll be JVR, Kulemin and Grabo on one line and Kadri, Comorov and maccarthur on the other line, not sure what defenseman will get sent down but gardiner did a full practise and is awaiting doctor clearence to play. Not sure if this is the big announcement from the leafs."
761649,tb4me,2013-01-22 23:20:00,3295,"I wish they would be rid of Kuli..He is brutal on offence, Time to bump him down to the 3rd line and bring Kadri and JVR up to the 2nd line"
761660,kickingfrog,2013-01-22 23:40:00,8333,Talk of Gretzky being the next president of MLSE.
761672,tb4me,2013-01-23 00:39:00,3295,Say what? Where is that comming from?
761691,tb4me,2013-01-23 01:15:00,3295,"Ya too bad... Darren Dregger, who is Nunas brother in law I might add, just tweeted that he recived a text from 99 that he has not been contacted by anyone from MLSEPay close attention to Darren Dreggers tweets folks, he is the only source I trust when it comes to the Leafs.."
761704,kickingfrog,2013-01-23 01:35:00,8333,The Gretzky talk has been going on for years with MLSE. And it might never be more than talk but it is so above Nonis.
761708,jedimaster,2013-01-23 01:48:00,3472,Yah  heard about the gretzky thing on the way home from work tonight as well. I also heard about this whole Burkie and Hazel Mae having a baby thing? Is that actually confirmed true? Holy moly that is freakin awesome. Good for burkie if it is true.
761715,kickingfrog,2013-01-23 01:58:00,8333,Pure gossip not even suitable for trashy magazines.
761730,jedimaster,2013-01-23 02:39:00,3472,Dang too bad. That would be awesome. haha
761963,jedimaster,2013-01-24 00:27:00,3472,Haven't noticed jvr or kadri yet but the leafs skating checking and fighting step for step with the pens so far. If you are not watching its on tsn. Great play so far by the buds.
761968,jedimaster,2013-01-24 00:38:00,3472,Yah that was a tilt. I get the feeling like this will be orr's last season. He is gonna get his bell rung at some point and that will be the end.
761975,tb4me,2013-01-24 01:04:00,3295,"Lets face it Orr is just there for that purpose. He provides an element to the game that the fans love.More of a show then a game when it comes to that..So if he gets his bell ring so be it..Thats what he gets paid to do. Its not like it will be a suprise..Where is all this extra ice time Kadri is supposed to get? Got the last seconds of a crappy PP. Reimer let in a softie, now lets see how he responds..Go Leafs Go!"
761976,Guest,2013-01-24 01:07:00,0,"Just got back from fishing and forgot the leafs were on.  Gonna watch the 2nd period, but knowing the pens I might be turning it off early."
761010,muskymatt,2013-01-20 19:57:00,2608,"I guess I just don't get Laff humor lol, probably never will!"
761011,kickingfrog,2013-01-20 20:03:00,8333,"Outside, looking in."
761018,Jigger,2013-01-20 20:38:00,1237, TEAM	       GP	G	A	P	+/-	PIM	PP	SH	GWG REGULAR SEASON  Spezza OTT	80	34	50	84	 11	36	10	0	2  Lupul   TOR	66	25	42	67	 1	48	8	0	3  But Spezza is worth the 7mil caphit and can build a championship team around?
761026,muskymatt,2013-01-20 21:11:00,2608,"True, can't argue that."
761030,muskymatt,2013-01-20 21:20:00,2608,"  Spezza is an above point per game player and is extreamly gifted with the puck, especially now that he doesn't do those giveaway blind passes as often He also finished 4th in league points last year, I'd say he's a guy to build a team areound"
761036,kickingfrog,2013-01-20 21:40:00,8333,And as long as the sens management feels that way the sens will always be the sens.
761039,Guest,2013-01-20 21:44:00,0,"Im still new to this form, but was wondering if things are usually like this when someone posts a topic on the leafs.  If so thats great.  Go Leafs Go"
761047,Jigger,2013-01-20 22:01:00,1237,Also was drafted 2nd overall so its expected that he puts those numbers up. Lupul came here with huge question marks in regards to his back which he put to rest and was 5th in scoring when his shoulder separation cost him the rest of the season.
761048,muskymatt,2013-01-20 22:05:00,2608,"Yeah, clearly since the last lockout the Sens have been under achievers, maybe they should sit up and pay attention to the winning recipe the Laffs have. They seem to have it figured out lol"
761056,moxie,2013-01-20 22:32:00,1566,Last words on this. This thread has clearly demonstrated what I've always thought to be true. Leaf fans have very little knowledge of the game.
761063,Guest,2013-01-20 23:02:00,0,"Just for the record buddy.  Guys like Cherry, Mcclean, Kipper, and the rest of the hockey analysis come to me for advice."
761074,jedimaster,2013-01-20 23:30:00,3472,"Sounds alike a few sens and habs fans are still sulking. I am not so big on lupal, I don't think I would have given him a 5 year deal. He would have been one of the guys I would consider dumping to clear up cap space to make a run at some free agents this year."
761075,jedimaster,2013-01-20 23:32:00,3472,And for the new guy asking about leaf threads. Yah well the only two sens fans that know how to use a computer started a sens thread once but noone read it. The only way they get to talk hockey is to talk about the leafs. Have the sens ever sold out a game that wasn't against the leafs?
761082,kickingfrog,2013-01-20 23:53:00,8333,Wrong twice.
761102,moxie,2013-01-21 00:34:00,1566,
761379,Christopheraaron,2013-01-22 00:14:00,3525,"It's a new day, new game, I'll take toronto over buffalo, 2-1 in OT"
761389,Christopheraaron,2013-01-22 00:30:00,3525,"LOL, I know. Hard to watch."
761392,Christopheraaron,2013-01-22 00:33:00,3525,Orr just owned Scott!
761393,jedimaster,2013-01-22 00:34:00,3472,"Haha great fight, lets keep it together, scrivens looking a bit more solid on his feet."
761394,registerfly,2013-01-22 00:38:00,198,what the hell are we blacked out in TO??
761398,registerfly,2013-01-22 00:42:00,198,Phew found it on SN which had it listed as Alpine Skiing
761403,davey buoy,2013-01-22 00:46:00,5505,I'm glad you found it. I wouldn't know what we'd do with out hockey  lol.
761404,Christopheraaron,2013-01-22 00:46:00,3525,"LOL, didn't say hard to listen to"
761406,Pikeslayer,2013-01-22 00:52:00,1443," Very low blow there children. No doubt, your families are proud?"
761408,registerfly,2013-01-22 00:54:00,198,"don't be a hater, I wanted to see the opening ceremonies, and besides at least there is a reason to watch when they are in contention, as opposed to the spring"
760827,DRIFTER_016,2013-01-20 03:22:00,10439,I really enjoy it when the Leafs play in Ottawa. I love how the Ottawa fans are so easily drowned out by the Leaf fans. I wonder how the senioritas feel to have more visiting fans than fans of their own.
760829,jedimaster,2013-01-20 03:30:00,3472,"Did the sens even play today? I doubt anyone would have noticed, even in Ottawa."
760831,DRIFTER_016,2013-01-20 03:33:00,10439,They played in Winterpeg. Alfie was terribly injured when one of the rubber caps fell off the leg of his walker and dug into the ice.   :tease:
760832,chris.brock,2013-01-20 03:33:00,4053,"cool, 2 pts!  like- Kostka - Kadri - Kessel  liked somewhat- Bozak - Lupul - Komisarek  not good- VanRiemsdyk - Kulemin  Scrivens got the job done, but I thought he looked shakey  oh yeah, I did have some wine with dinner, I did get a little choked up during the national anthem, Hockey's Back baby!"
760835,tb4me,2013-01-20 03:56:00,3295,Go Leafs Go!! What a game..Lots to improve on but 2 points is still 2 points when i went to school..
760836,irishfield,2013-01-20 03:58:00,26272,
760839,jedimaster,2013-01-20 04:26:00,3472,"I like the cut of your jib.  I fully accept the leafs will get exploited by the elite teams this year but I am still hoping that we can make a few deals this season, get gardner back and make a swing a suban. I would be pretty disappointed if the leafs don't make an offer sheet."
760844,moxie,2013-01-20 05:05:00,1566,"Leafs Win, Leafs Win!!!!!!. They're on a roll boys!!!!!! The beginning of yet another season filled with delusions of grandeur. Leaf fans wouldn't have it any other way cause i guess it beats the alternative. Reality."
760852,Handlebarz,2013-01-20 06:10:00,3790,I did not think I would have cared that it was back I had zero plans of watching the leafs tonight. My plans were to just make lures but I found myself sitting in front of the TV just like last year putting hooks on wire shafts and adding hook protectors watching the game. I thought it was a good game and a great ending.  Am I the only one that thinks the leafs have a real chance this year? Just think about it they usually start strong then crap out so maybe the playoffs will be over before they remember its time to suck. They will be like the migratory birds and get confused and keep winning right into the playoffs. Well I can hope and know one thing if they get Ottawa in the first round that like a by into the second round GO LEAFS GO. Right Squid
760856,irishfield,2013-01-20 06:13:00,26272,BAHHHH
760861,Guest,2013-01-20 10:24:00,0,Go Leafs Go.  This seasons gonna be crazy so im looking forward to seeing whos gonna come out on top.
760862,Guest,2013-01-20 10:26:00,0,The Vancouver fans wanted him and they got him lol
760904,jedimaster,2013-01-20 15:13:00,3472,The vancouver game was awesome. Serves that snivelling weasel of a gm right. Imagine shoving your boot in a goalies face and then pulling the guy they replaced him with in the first game. Oh man I am loving this.
760911,kickingfrog,2013-01-20 15:25:00,8333,"I think it's safe to say that we all hate exhibition games, but geeze, on the whole those games today suck hard. Six days of practice is clearly not enough preparation."
760917,Jigger,2013-01-20 16:04:00,1237,"^^ Have to agree. That was a pretty tough game to watch. You could tell who had been playing during the lockout and who wasn't. Cant say I really noticed a system on the Toronto side. Carlyle has his work cut out for him, a 6 day camp isn't much to build on. Good on the Leafs for giving the kids an honest shot. I didn't think Kostka looked out of place at all."
760932,moxie,2013-01-20 16:32:00,1566,"I understand Sin, but really now. How long can one someone be kicked in the teeth before they figure out it just isn't worth it. Athletes  are the equivalent of the gladiators of old. Unlike their predecessors,  they live to fight another day, are worshiped like gods and are paid a handsome ransom they do not deserve. Very disturbing indeed. I have a third nipple so I guess the leafs could have a chance.......NOT!!!!"
760953,Guest,2013-01-20 17:36:00,0,But I wish they would have traded Luongo so they wouldnt have had a backup plan.  Suck it Vancouver
760976,Jigger,2013-01-20 18:15:00,1237,X2! Hope he can keep last years numbers up!

760992,kickingfrog,2013-01-20 18:54:00,8333,white noise
761003,muskymatt,2013-01-20 19:46:00,2608,"White noise is a random signal or process with a flat power spectral density. In other words, the signal contains equal power within a fixed bandwidth at any center frequency. White noise draws its name from white light in which the power spectral density of the light is distributed over the visible band in such a way that the eye's three color receptors (cones) are approximately equally stimulated.  In statistical sense, a time series rt is characterized as having weak white noise if {rt} is a sequence of serially uncorrelated random variables with zero mean and finite variance. Strong white noise also has the quality of being independent and identically distributed. In particular, if rt is normally distributed with mean zero and standard deviation σ, the series is called a Gaussian white noise.[1]  An infinite-bandwidth white noise signal is a purely theoretical construction. The bandwidth of white noise is limited in practice by the mechanism of noise generation, by the transmission medium and by finite observation capabilities. A random signal is considered ""white noise"" if it is observed to have a flat spectrum over a medium's widest possible bandwidth.     I hope that helps!  lol"
761004,kickingfrog,2013-01-20 19:48:00,8333,I should have known even that would go over your head.  Edit to add:  bwahahahahahahahhahahahahahaha
761008,DRIFTER_016,2013-01-20 19:56:00,10439,  So do I. What's your point?
760738,jedimaster,2013-01-19 23:51:00,3472,Well I know some of you have it in for the nhl but no matter what team you root for here is hoping we see some great hockey.  I am gonna go out on a limb here and call a 3-1  win for toronto tonight.
760747,Gerritt,2013-01-20 00:19:00,6129,Go leafs go!
760749,davey buoy,2013-01-20 00:23:00,5505,I'll second that!!!!!!!!!!!!!
760756,Christopheraaron,2013-01-20 00:44:00,3525,"1-0 leafs right now, pretty even game"
760762,jedimaster,2013-01-20 00:52:00,3472,Nice hands as I have maintained all along for kadri. He held onto it long enoygh to get a great goal. Lots of guys just chip that one back on net for an easy save. He is even playing with some chippy chippy. I like what I see so far from kadri and jvr. Both are playing with grit.
760765,irishfield,2013-01-20 00:54:00,26272,"Been watching hockey on TV since I was knee high to a grasshopper.. sitting in the cold basement as a kid and trying to find the puck amongst the static on the old black and white. Can't even consider watching a hockey game now... with these snivelling, over paid, over rated sports folks chasing a puck around. I'm watching overpriced cars go across the block instead..."
760769,DRIFTER_016,2013-01-20 00:56:00,10439,PP is sucking right now but the D is playing well and they are layin' the body on Mtl. really good.
760776,jedimaster,2013-01-20 01:06:00,3472,Pp is coachable imo. Hopefully they can work on that. The grit is great to see. Lets hope they keep that up up for the full season for 60 mins every game. I honestly can't hold the lockout on the players. I blame bettman and the snivelling owners. I am loving this game so far. A bit sloppy and special teams aren't firing on ether side. Scrivens is putting himself in position even though he looks nervous falling all over the place.
760781,DRIFTER_016,2013-01-20 01:15:00,10439,"Scrivins has been run over several times already as well though.  TO's puck management is terrible tonight so far, that has to change."
760782,davey buoy,2013-01-20 01:17:00,5505,And only 20 mins in so far.  .
760784,Leecher,2013-01-20 01:23:00,7832,What about the first goal by the Habs????   And don't tell me it's because of the penalty called... that was lame   Referees are against them   It's a one way game right now... in favor of the Leafs    Let's see what happens in the 2nd & 3rd.  I'll be back... second period just began
760789,jedimaster,2013-01-20 01:35:00,3472,Refs are against who? The habs are a step behind so far and are reaching. That first goal by the habs was waived off long before. He never even got touched. I thought it was a bad call but the replay clearly showed he went in untouched. The snowjob call is a tough one. But that is a penalty none the less.
760791,jedimaster,2013-01-20 01:37:00,3472,Good pp goal there three guys battle in the corner win the puck back and two rebounds later and its 2-0
