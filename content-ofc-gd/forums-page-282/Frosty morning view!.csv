807764,Rod Caster,2013-09-14 13:28:00,5784,Gorgeous morning y'all!  First witness of frost for me. Great morning view from my 'man loft'.  That's a speck I caught in my back yard last night...she was full of eggs and swam away without concern.      
807765,lew,2013-09-14 13:38:00,12766,Beautiful piece of property !!
807766,Rod Caster,2013-09-14 13:43:00,5784,"Thanks, I'm really loving it here, workdays cannot end soon enough.I'm on a dead end and have one neighbor within 500 meters and none to the east, north or south of my house. I saw three cars pass by my house last week haha."
807768,kickingfrog,2013-09-14 14:00:00,8333,Very nice.   And nice redneck smores makers.
807769,spincast,2013-09-14 14:03:00,3279,"beauty spot. Our first frost down here this morning too.  Kind of early given how long it took summer to find us this year, I thought. The firewood looks like you should be good till,.... New Years? fat little spec."
807770,Rod Caster,2013-09-14 14:09:00,5784,"haha redneck 'smore maker.  I have one other 'round house' out of the picture and about 3 cords in my wood shed (not pictured).  Even with the cold nights, my house is holding the heat quite well and haven't had to use any energy at all. I'm thinking I'll get away with less than 10 cords this year...my piles add up to about 8 or 9 (guessing)."
807771,coolwater,2013-09-14 14:14:00,43,"Any property available near you? Nah...wait...my wife would never move there. oh well, I am jealous, it's a fantastic location."
807775,Joey,2013-09-14 14:35:00,9122,"Sweet, well not the frost part!"
807776,adolson,2013-09-14 14:56:00,783,You should have slit the belly and used the free bait to catch more.
807777,Sinker,2013-09-14 15:12:00,8692,Interesting way of piling wood. Never seen it done like that before. Is there a reason for piling it like that? Just curious?  S.
807781,Richie Razor,2013-09-14 16:09:00,536,Looks like you could put in a nice par 4 golf hole in there. Then my friend you would have the ultimate paradise!!! Sweet property
807782,woodenboater,2013-09-14 16:14:00,2277,"super sweet property ! guess a riding mower is in your future lol. your place is going to totally rock once all the trails are cleared and establishe, esp for snowshoeing in the hard water season.  am very jealous so you know"
807785,Rod Caster,2013-09-14 17:46:00,5784,"hahaha, the perpetual trout murder.  It's called a holz hosen (round house), my cousin who lives off the grid piles 'em this way for a couple reasons 1) aestetics and space efficiency 2) Reportedly it dries the wood faster... I decided to give it a shot.  SInce I only started cutting/stacking wood in July I needed to speed-dry my firewood. The round house apparently dries quicker due higher transpiration rates and the chimeney effect caused by its shape. It's a European thing from what I understand. After a couple of months, I'm very happy with the progress of the drying. The pile is slumping and the ends are cracking nicely.    I'm ahead of you on that one! Already launched a couple dozen balls down the 'fairway' haha.  Once I get a riding mower I might actually make some sort of par 3 hole. Yah!!"
807788,Roy,2013-09-14 18:28:00,13728,I'm really happy for you Chad. You must have worked hard for it....you deserve it. Let me know when I can get out there to fish the creek with you.
807808,mattyk,2013-09-15 00:22:00,2110,Very cool!
807825,gino,2013-09-15 03:38:00,400,"nice trout Chad, and i love the way you stashed your firewood....."
807842,bigugli,2013-09-15 12:45:00,6138,Old world method for stacking wood and storing hay or straw
807943,limeyangler,2013-09-16 12:04:00,5204,Great place Chad....i also love that wood pile....really cool!
807984,Rod Caster,2013-09-16 19:15:00,5784,I'm thinking a small spring '14 gtg might be in order. Hope you like blackflies.
