807940,fishindevil,2013-09-16 10:02:00,6254,At least they responded to me I'm impressed
807944,Angler management,2013-09-16 12:27:00,280,They should have to post a big sign stating ethanol. I think they do a good job misleading people into thinking its ethanol free!
807945,Fish4Eyes,2013-09-16 12:42:00,1022,I asked a guy at the Shell station last week and he said v-power has ethanol. He also went on to say how he has been working for Shell stations for 20 years and they always have had ethanol in v-power. The pump has no sticker saying no ethanol.
807946,Renegade67,2013-09-16 12:52:00,86,Anyone else have any problems with their fuel lines in the boat.  Seems to be eating the rubber sqeeze balls.   Never had that problem before ethanol.
807982,Sinker,2013-09-16 19:12:00,8692,"Yep, I had the original fuel line off my engine for about 15 yrs, worked fine, no problem. Started running ethanol fuel, and started having problems. Started by cleaning the carbs and worked my way all the way back to the tank from there. It was the line. After taking it apart, it was a gooey mess inside.  The shell station I use says right on the pump, no ethanol in V-power. They better not be rippin me off, or I'm gonna be pissed!! I'm going in there today. I want answers!! Friggen scammers as it is!!  S."
807986,BillM,2013-09-16 19:20:00,17367,Shell.ca states V-Power doesn't contain ethanol.  I think you're pretty safe in assuming it doesn't.
807994,walleyejack,2013-09-16 19:52:00,358,"Is it possible some Shell stations with 91 have Ethanol ? I wouldn t think so, but am looking at the Ontario list and in Ajax there are a few Shells, but there is only one listed Ethanol free. There are shell stations in Whitby, and are not on the list. Am curious Gerorge  AL"
807995,BillM,2013-09-16 19:55:00,17367,If Shell gets their fuel from multiple depots then yeah it's very possible.
807997,walleyejack,2013-09-16 20:01:00,358,ok  thank you  looked up a Costco link also.. it may or may not contain Ethanol  
807998,walleyejack,2013-09-16 20:04:00,358,"So what you are saying Mr.Bill.   one has to look for the sticker on the pump, and trust that the station has done the right thing and placed a sticker on it if it has ethanol."
808030,fishindevil,2013-09-16 22:13:00,6254,There should be a simple test stick ?? Like if it turns red has ethanol ??? A simple little drop and it would tell you right away!!!!! I'm gonna patent that .... Lol
808031,fishindevil,2013-09-16 22:16:00,6254,The truth is simple: corn gas is garbage !!!! Period  and all they have done is de-graded gas and spiced it back up with ethanol !!!!!! It doesn't even smell the same it's just garbage !!!!! And to think grow corn to burn it instead of feeding people or livestock !!!! Brilliant ...... Ya can't fix stupid.
807480,DanD,2013-09-12 14:03:00,2223,Not sure how accurate this site is; but I called Kraft Auto Care (listed on the map) here in London and they said that yes their fuel is 100% ethanol free. They're selling unbranded Suncor fuel that the ethanol has not been added to.  http://www.historicvehicle.org/Resources/Resources/US-Hobby-Law-Maps/Pure-Gas-Map/North  Dan.
807482,BillM,2013-09-12 14:09:00,17367,"Great link, time to find something local."
807506,Sinker,2013-09-12 15:40:00,8692,"I'm lucky to have several in my area. The difference in gas mileage in my vehicles is incredible, versus fuel with ethanol!! At least 100km/tank, and if I keep my foot out of it, close to 200km/tank.  S."
807513,fishindevil,2013-09-12 15:50:00,6254,"its unreal isnt shayne !!! i guess  you gas up at the guy in bethany?? he has great gas....  I'm lucky to have several in my area. The difference in gas mileage in my vehicles is incredible, versus fuel with ethanol!! At least 100km/tank, and if I keep my foot out of it, close to 200km/tank.S."
807541,Rich,2013-09-12 17:47:00,3927,"Why was ethanol added to fuel in the first place?  A serious, clueless question."
807550,BillM,2013-09-12 18:57:00,17367, To reduce emissions.
807552,John Bacon,2013-09-12 19:14:00,3277,"But if you have to use more fuel to drive the same distance, is it really reducing emissions?  If it does, then is it enough to offset the emissions created by having to grow all that corn just to produce ethanol?"
807559,irishfield,2013-09-12 20:09:00,26272,"No it wasn't Bill.. come'on you're much smarter than that, the idea came about to raise the price of corn! Simple as that."
807562,wildeye rainbow,2013-09-12 20:28:00,123,Ethanol - what a crock of an idea.  What's it take to grow a bushel of corn and then transport it to the processing plant and then from the plant to the refinery to blend it with gasoline.  Probably burning way more energy to get ethanol than what we get out of it.  Plus it gums up small gas engines like my 2hp Yamaha or lawnmowers.  WR
807563,DRIFTER_016,2013-09-12 20:37:00,10439,I'm lucky that no gas station  North of 60* has corn juice in the gas.
807564,Sinker,2013-09-12 20:40:00,8692,"Bethany, millbrook, and pontypool all get my $$. Even V-power doesn't get as good mileage, and its not supposed to have ethanol. If I'm away from home, only V-power goes in my tank.  S."
807583,Angler management,2013-09-12 22:32:00,280,"I find ultra 94 the best fuel around. Highest octane levels in canada, and no ethanol. However its very expensive. I think 10-12 cents per liter more then regular."
807592,wormdunker,2013-09-12 23:19:00,1711,"Good read for me , by all participants.  i usually run regular unleaded in my truck ( by the way just picked up a 2008 Ford King Ranch - awesome truck).  When travelling I always put Shell in my outboard & ATV"
807600,SirCranksalot,2013-09-13 00:18:00,3291,"I'm not sure how complete that list is. I understood that Shell premium was ethanol free, but I don't see our local shell station on that map."
807601,Angler management,2013-09-13 00:28:00,280,Thats what i was thinking... But i think they list gas stations that have regular and mid-grade gasoline without ethanol.
807606,Richie Razor,2013-09-13 01:01:00,536,"Does ""winter gas"" have ethanol in it?"
807620,nexstar,2013-09-13 04:34:00,63,the 91 octane gas at Ultramar does not have ethanol.
807625,fishindevil,2013-09-13 07:30:00,6254,Some Canadian tire gas bars carry ethanol free gas as well I have a list at work I will post it later but there is till lots of places to get it you just need to know where !!!! But like said before corn gas is garbage !!!! It attracts moisture !!!!! My new truck is designed to run off E85 if I want to use it which I never will but I always run premium in my 2011 Yamaha outboard and my 2010 Yamaha sled !!! And always use seafoam as well but it's axing how fast corn gas can attract moisture and cause phase separation !!! So it's always good to run stuff like seafoam or startron !!!!
807626,fishindevil,2013-09-13 07:33:00,6254,
807648,porkpie,2013-09-13 12:36:00,2521,"Hard to find so I put shell premium in my ATV, boat motor and all small engines.  I can usually always find a shell station!  Ethanol and small engines don't mix.  The truck gets regular."
807649,Raf,2013-09-13 12:45:00,3495, Ethanol is an octane booster.  It allows refiners to refine a lower grade of gas then boost it to meet 87/89/91/94 requirements.  Suncor uses ethanol in all their branded fuels.  DO the math.
807904,Angler management,2013-09-15 23:35:00,280,"Thanks for that info! I looked into it on the Petro Canada website, and youre right! But i specifically remember the pump saying may contain up to 10% ethanol on every grade except ultra 94. I wonder if that was changed recently or maybe a change from sunoco/petro"
807908,Sinker,2013-09-16 00:02:00,8692,"All suncor fuel has had ethanol as long as its been around. Only shell v-power, or these small no-name stations have no ethanol in any grade.  S"
807938,fishindevil,2013-09-16 10:00:00,6254,You are right shayne I just emailed petro Canada and even their ultra 94 has up to 10% ethanol !!! Like I told them corn gas is garbage grrrrrr
