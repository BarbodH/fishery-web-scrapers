807553,Dozer,2013-09-12 19:31:00,896," Rather see roe not being allowed to be used as bait however you're right, I would much rather see the eggs being harvested from stockers vs. wild, self sustaining populations no doubt.  As for no natural reproduction occurring I'm not sure thats the case, sure, lots of stocking but there are still fish that are able to spawn successfully in other systems, the numbers are probably small...  The bait is free - factor out the costs of the rods, lines, gas, etc. ( which already you own because you are fisherman ) the roe is still free.  You didn't pay for it, didn't trade anything for it.  The mentality "" we paid $60 to get here so we better get as much roe as possible"" is retarded to me - shows a lack of respect - hatchery, wild fish, whatever fish.  I would imagine a lot of those fish get tossed - recycling bins fill up fast in some parking lots.  I am getting softer and softer... certainly my view of fishing has changed since day 1 and can't deal with certain things any more.  It upsets me, it really does.  I couldn't take what I witnessed on some of those NY tribs, cut trips short because I was sick of what was going on around me.  East tribs are my stomping grounds and I refuse to go to popular spots because of the down right rape that goes down... did I mention that I'm a softie?"
807613,BillM,2013-09-13 02:58:00,17367,"If you've been to the Oak, or Burt you know there's no natural reproduction going on.   It's too bad the NY DNR would rather stock a 1,000,000 fish a year instead of improving stream habitat.  But what can ya do...  Still a place I enjoy fishing once in a while even if I'm not bringing back roe with me."

807774,craigdritchie,2013-09-14 14:35:00,1586,"Nice idea, but banning roe won't do anything to stop this kind of stuff.  Snagging fish is already illegal, yet hundreds of people still do it every weekend.  Same thing for fishing in the sanctuary, or for slitting fish for eggs then leaving the carcass to rot. Happens all the time, in spite of being blatantly illegal.  Whoever chopped and hacked that brown has already broken one, and likely two provincial fishing laws. Do you really think they're worried about breaking a third one by fishing with roe if it's ever banned?  Not a chance.  It is pretty rare to see a C.O. on the river in the fall, when they're already busy with hunting season. Even if you do get caught doing something wrong, what's the fine? $100? It's not exactly a strong deterrent. Guys will be right back out there the next day, doing the same stuff all over again.  I'm not defending this, I'm just pointing out the reality. It's already illegal to snag fish, to fish in sanctuaries, to fish for species that are out of season, or to parade up and down the river at night with nothing but a big landing net, but it all happens on an a daily basis. So why would people who are already flaunting the law care about a ban on roe? Guys who slit fish for eggs will continue to do so, because they know the odds of being caught are basically zero.  Banning roe is not the answer. Increasing enforcement, and laying heavier fines that really would act as a deterrent, is."
807811,Christopheraaron,2013-09-15 00:58:00,3525,"Ok, how about this. Today I saw a slit fish with ALL of it's eggs still there!"

807420,Dozer,2013-09-12 01:59:00,896,"A person wthout the license would of probably taken the fish to feed the family with ""salmans"".  We also can't be quick to judge... this fish could of been dead and the eggs legally harvested."

807434,Old Ironmaker,2013-09-12 05:03:00,8243,"Yea pass me a govermint. Now that's funny.  Unless these ""Russians"" were wearing a military uniform how can one tell exactly what nationality they are? Could they have been Ukrainian, from Chechnya, Belarus , Kazakhstan, Croatian, Serbian, Macedonian, from Ohio, maybe Polish or Greek, I sure can't tell until I recognize the language, which isn't easy as for me as I don't speak any of those. Including Ohioan.  If they really were Russian I would be careful they might have been former KGB and those guys are pretty tough I hear.  To be serious with everyone having a phone in their pockets today why not call something you see illegal in? If I hear the excuse they don't come anyway it makes us as ignorant as the poacher. It is illegal to spoil game fish the last time I read the regs.  To kill a fish to harvest the roe to kill another fish is as illogical and insane as it sounds. 20 years ago you walk up to a guy and tell him "" pal, that's illegal you might want to think twice about what your doing"".  Today you might catch a bullet for your efforts. So get out your smart phone, take a picture of the license plate of the car, a picture of the ""Russian"", call a cop, call a C.O, but do something about it or don't complain it's happening all around you. Yes it's frustrating being told to push 20 numbers before you get a human on the phone, it's infuriating, you can't even order a pizza without going through a 6 digit directory in New York City or L.A. But it's life today as we know it. Is anyone willing to pay triple for a fishing permit if it guarantees someone answer the phone? I don't think so.  I love this site, it can be educational but sometimes we need to look in a mirror and ask ourselves who's being ignorant. Stupidity is a DNA thing ignorance is turning a blind eye and then complaining laws are being broken and nobody is doing anything about it. Or pegging someone of being a certain nationality when we really don't know for certain, and does it really matter where they are from? I remember asking my grand father when I was a kid, what part of the Mafia we were in because we are Italian, come on man!"
807435,Dozer,2013-09-12 05:10:00,896, Why not?  Anything is possible out east.
807440,chris.brock,2013-09-12 07:34:00,4053," yeah, I hear ya, but  I go fishing to fish, be outside, relax, not to be a 1 man army, or get into fist fights on the Coboconk dam  point taken though,"
807441,Old Ironmaker,2013-09-12 08:20:00,8243,"Chris,  Stuff like this sure drives me nuts as well. Watching 10"" Smallmouth and Largemouth going into a cooler, same goes for year old Walleye and hammerhandle Northerns. It sure isn't illegal but should be. All the legislators in the world can't make a law banning stupidity. I hear about the fist fights on the piers along Lake Ontario this time of year. It seems fishing for some is simply a cheap way to feed a family and in these economic times, can you blame a guy for feeding his kids, I can't. Times are tough, wars have been waged across the annals of history over fishing rights. I don't believe it was that long ago a Canadian Coast Guard vessel or one of our Navy ships had to put one across the bow of a Spanish fishing vessel somewhere on the east coast.  This is becoming nuts as someone said the population is growing far too quickly in southern Ontario and I must add the poverty rate is soaring. And I also agree as someone here said they will just close all the Ontario tributaries to everyone and designate them sanctuaries so as to not have to police them.  It's just sad we have to talk about something like but this is the age of more, more and I'll have some more, smart phones, cars, trucks, SUV's, bigger houses, bigger TV's, bigger toys, bigger breasts. If I was younger and could see into the future I would have found a spot where no one could find me and my lady and lived off the land, after I bought shares in Microsoft!  As Kim Mitchell said "" lets go for a soda where nobody hurts and nobody dies"". I don't think that place exists anywhere as the greyer I get the more cynical I become.  In this great age of instant communication, twitting, teetering, texting, twatting or whatever they call it nobody talks to one another, it's too gd hard."

I mean, I could understand if it were a pike, but this is an edible fish we're talking about."
807519,Rich,2013-09-12 16:23:00,3927,Pike aren't edible anymore? Sweet I'll tell the yocals that fill stringers with them all spring!

807527,highdrifter,2013-09-12 16:48:00,2534, We could go over this at length but you'd have to take a trip down south and stand shoulder to shoulder with us to understand...
807532,Dozer,2013-09-12 17:10:00,896," Pretty much dude - free bait.  Lots of people doing it to be honest, can't go fishing without seeing a split open fish especially during the salmon run.  Ever heard of roe runs DanA?  A group of guys will band together, get New York licenses, head down for 3 days.  In New York, you are allowed to keep 3 browns a day, therefore each guy gets 9 fish after those 3 days all for roe.  Now some will defend themselves and legitimize the situation by saying ""Its a put and take fishery"" however that doesn't justify the fact they are raiding the fish just for the eggs, at least thats how I see it.  Last year fishing in a well known area in New York had a couple people ask me if I'm there just for the eggs and some random Canadian guy ( setup with the expensive jacket, rod, reel ) say ""I cant stand fishing here"" only to leave with 3 big brown hens.  As if it was a chore for him to be fishing..."
807538,Rich,2013-09-12 17:34:00,3927,"Now, to play devil's advocate.. it seems silly to slit fish for bait, to catch more fish, for more bait..  Though I'm sure for some it's just as silly to go out day after day, chase fish, spend countless dollars on equipment simply to take a picture and put a fish back. Not to mention ignore mortality rates in the process.  Just seeing the coin from both sides."
807545,Freshtrax,2013-09-12 17:59:00,2215, I sure miss my uncles dark  green dodge ram in the 90's we would pull op on a creek and people would scatter...

Although I gotta ask, you'd rather see guys taking eggs from wild, self sustaining fisheries or put and take stock fisheries were no natural reproduction occurs?  As for that roe being 'free', you really need to factor all the costs involved with going down there and fishing.. Free isn't exactly a term I'd be using."
807315,Locnar,2013-09-11 15:23:00,645,"I was hiking along a creek, and found this... I believe those eggs laying on the bottom below the belly, which I didn't see until I looked at the picture. If you're going to do this, which I do not promote, at least take the roe."

807318,highdrifter,2013-09-11 15:32:00,2534,"When does the need for roe trump someone's understanding that this was a living thing and should have been given the outmost care and respect...

807321,NAW,2013-09-11 15:52:00,4022,Brutal indeed.  I'd be inclined to take it (if it where obviously fresh and eadible) for a meal.  That coming from an angler who could catch a trout to save his life.....
807323,BillM,2013-09-11 16:12:00,17367,Looks like the guy didn't take all of it!  I hope you took it home with you and tied it up.  Brownie roe is awesome!
807324,Richie Razor,2013-09-11 16:22:00,536,Utterly disgusting. What a nice little hen as well. But it happens every single fall... perhaps the MNR should invest in signage or further explanation against this sort of thing in the yearly rule book?

And with social media now the public is going to get involved sooner or later and they will probly ban fall creek fishing ?? It would not suprise me it's just  a gong show and a sensless thing but it labels us all as fishermen who would do this as we as a group can do nothing to stop it or we end up going to jail !!!! When will we take our fisheries back from all the idiots ??? And that's not just creek fishing !!!! Ever been to a Kawartha lakes dam and see the bucket brigades in action ?? It would be easy to stop just not the legal way !!!!
