807823,okumasheffield,2013-09-15 03:16:00,318,Spectra & Dyneema seem to be the only 2 materials for braided lines on the market. Wonder which one is preferred by OFNers
807827,adempsey,2013-09-15 04:39:00,1498,They're basically the same material made by two different companies.  I'd suspect there is as much difference between two brands of line made with Spectra as there are between a line made with Spectra and another with Dyneema.  I think in this case it's better to compare specific lines than what they are composed of.
807830,okumasheffield,2013-09-15 08:06:00,318,Dyneema claims how hydrophobic it is whereas Spectra does not.  Have not been able to find specifics for Spectra.
807855,MJL,2013-09-15 14:21:00,2427,"A quick Googling brought this up  http://www.coastalwindsports.com/WhoseLine.html  As FishLogic mentioned, both are made of the same material (Ultra High Molecular Polyethylene) by 2 different companies.  For the lines that I like, I choose PowerPro (Spectra) and sometimes Tuf-Line (They use both Spectra and Dyneema depending on the model). Personally I don't care what they're made of so long as they perform well.   "

807969,bare foot wader,2013-09-16 17:54:00,1354,"my understanding was those materials won't absorb colour dyes, so a matter of how quickly the colour coatings will fade, some better than others, is easy to recolour with a marker if it bothers you....I'd like to see them make a braid that is actually perfectly round, not just false advertising hype"
