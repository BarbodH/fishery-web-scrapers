I'm looking from something to provide a little protection but it must be light (e.g., floor stickers, diamond plate mat, etc.).  Need to cover a 2 x 3' area at the bow and stern."

807457,sauce,2013-09-12 12:47:00,219,Anti fatigue mats. Or hit up your local auto wreckers for floor mats.
807462,Fang,2013-09-12 12:59:00,1330,"go to google images and type in  play room floor mats  canadian tire sells these for pretty cheap and they go on sale regularly. Can't tell you the number of applications I've found for these around the garage, outdoors. Great thing is they can be trimmed easy to size and they link together"

807492,DRIFTER_016,2013-09-12 14:57:00,10439,A piece of astroturf works fine. I have even used it in an inflatable raft with good results.
807605,Sharkbait22,2013-09-13 00:53:00,297,Thanks for the suggestions.  I might try this Diamond Deck vinyl http://www.homedepot.ca/product/5-feet-x-3-feet-metallic-graphite-door-mat/998345 if it's not too heavy.  Astroturf wouldn't show any marks but where can you get it?
