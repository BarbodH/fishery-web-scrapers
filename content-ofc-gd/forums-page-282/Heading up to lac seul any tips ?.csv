806474,Phil 65,2013-09-05 11:02:00,37,Hey guys the wife surprised me with a trip to andersons lodge at lac seul . I knew we were taking the week off together but this is out of left field . any tips for the trip & fish of a lifetime  .
806475,limeyangler,2013-09-05 11:09:00,5204,"20' to 45' FOW .  I am not too familiar with that area of the lake, its a BIG LAKE, but as a general rule for myself, at this time of year for walleye, those are the depths i concentrate on and do very well at in other areas of Lac Seul. I am heading out to Lac Seul in about 1 hour so will post a report with depths locations etc this evening.  Mid water humps, Rock to soft bottom and deeper sandbar areas have all been good, but for me the depth factor seems to be the most important common denominator.  Some wicked good fishing this time of year......your wife got you a pretty awesome gift!"

806513,BucktownAngler,2013-09-05 16:38:00,582,"i fished up in that area. we didnt even have depth finders, we just trolled shallow diving crankbaits and caught at least 40 fish each a day. combination of pike walleye and bass. some blue walleye too. best bait for me was original floating rapala. gold colour i also caught a musky trolling right in front of andersons lodge, i've heard thats a good spot for musky."
