807709,ketchenany,2013-09-13 22:35:00,3229,I'm somewhat hair challenged lol. He must shampoo with Gulp.
807710,Locnar,2013-09-13 22:38:00,645,"Ahahah, that was awesome. But I can't help it, I'm pretty sure that's a pumpkinseed... not a bass."
807716,Nipfisher,2013-09-13 23:40:00,2449,  Looks like a bass to me?
807717,Christopheraaron,2013-09-13 23:43:00,3525,"lol, definitely bass, too long for sunfish."
807719,Christopheraaron,2013-09-13 23:44:00,3525,watching it a second time I actually think it's a bluegill
807720,Locnar,2013-09-13 23:47:00,645,"Yeah, I full-screened it and paused when it was broadside to the camera... Definitely looks like a bluegill, got that nice dark spot on the gill plates."
807723,misfish,2013-09-14 00:31:00,29133, Sunfish/blue gill. Correct.  Thats was so cool to watch. Young lads having fun.
807730,OhioFisherman,2013-09-14 01:13:00,6623, Yep
807732,nexstar,2013-09-14 01:13:00,63,It looks like a bluegill to me. Should try that on a girl with longer hair next time and watch her catch a pike on it. LOL
807734,Rizzo,2013-09-14 01:14:00,4754,now cast that kid out there and wait for something big to hit the bluegill
807737,Nipfisher,2013-09-14 02:00:00,2449,"o.k. I thought it was a bass, but agree it is a pan fish."
807738,manitoubass2,2013-09-14 02:12:00,11391,"They were having too much fun for that to be legal. Next up, hair fishing equals one rod lol"
807745,NAW,2013-09-14 06:16:00,4022,"Man, those guys got so excited when it actually worked.  I wonder how long that guy sat there with his head hanging over the side of the boat?"
807761,coolwater,2013-09-14 13:11:00,43,"I can top that one, I think. While stream fishing for speckles just north of Sturgeon Falls a few years ago. lost my last Mepps on a snag. Heading back to the canoe found an old campfire with some tin foil left behind. Wrapped the tin foil, along with two split shot, around the shank of two hooks, a few casts later, a two lb spec. and lost my foil. No one believed me when I got back to camp, but.....true story."
807763,Rod Caster,2013-09-14 13:23:00,5784,Looks like fun haha
807778,BillM,2013-09-14 15:19:00,17367," It's a bluegill...    Pause it after he takes it out of the water, you can see the black spot on the gill plate."
807806,Sinker,2013-09-14 21:46:00,8692,"Just goes to show how easy bass (sunfish) are to catch  try getting a real fish, with teeth, to do that! Lol  S"
