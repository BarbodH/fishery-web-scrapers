806991,manitoubass2,2013-09-09 20:26:00,11391,"I have a plane old plastic fold up table that I got for like $20. Works great, east to clean and takes up no room. Also use it to prep food while bbqing. Of course this doesn't answer the original question, but I just thought I'd share a better option (IMO)"
807078,DanD,2013-09-10 12:37:00,2223,I stole my wife's ironing board and a buddy of mine that's a butcher got the plastic carving board for me. It's a little taller then a regular table and a lot easier on this old man's back. LOL  Dan 
807082,DropShot'r,2013-09-10 13:02:00,62," I'm guessing you want these fish for consumption.  With all do respect here sir, I'd rather eat fried river bottom mud than a fall run salmon.   Steve"
807089,fishindevil,2013-09-10 14:06:00,6254,"fried river bottom would be a delicasy compared to a fall carcass,i mean salmon....too funny,might as well wear a glow in the dark tinfoil hat !!!!"
807181,SirCranksalot,2013-09-10 23:20:00,3291,Must disagree--I've had salmon fresh in from Lake H and it was delicious.
807216,Richie Razor,2013-09-11 01:05:00,536,We're talking about a totally different body of water lol.
807218,redpearl99,2013-09-11 01:08:00,259,  Who ever said anything about salmon sir?  you seem to be making a lot of assumptions there.  I merely asked where are the closest fish cleaning stations
807221,Roy,2013-09-11 01:17:00,13728,Thank you everyone for your input. Thread locked as per the original poster's request.
806791,redpearl99,2013-09-08 13:28:00,259,can someone please give me a list of the various fish cleaning stations around southern ontario / GTA area.  the only one I know about is the port credit cleaning station.
806793,HTHM,2013-09-08 13:31:00,4082,"Two come to mind immediately: gunnels of your boat and/or your kitchen. That is what I do, refuse goes in the water or the green bin."
806800,Joeytier,2013-09-08 15:06:00,3990,My tailgate and one of my paddles!
806802,Terry,2013-09-08 15:30:00,14456,roe roe roe you know
806803,BillM,2013-09-08 15:36:00,17367, LOL yeah pretty much.
806805,Twocoda,2013-09-08 15:54:00,4130,"Kincardine ,Port Elgin Southampton and Owen Sound"
806808,BillM,2013-09-08 16:08:00,17367,"Go down to Port Hope, find some guys from Quebec or some guys from eastern Europe, lol..  The next time they gank a big female with a marshmellow and a treble and are filleting it on the side of the bank ask to keep the roe, they won't want it."
806812,misfish,2013-09-08 16:29:00,29133,"  Dont be so fast on that one Bill. They cure the eggs for consumption. I asked them for the roe,they said,we eat it.. Even watched a these guys clean a hen at the Angus cleaning station. They kept the head,liver and roe. Just threw the bones and fins and guts away."
806813,BillM,2013-09-08 16:33:00,17367," Sorry man, I've seen to many of them on the Pine zipping fish, filleting them and throwing the rest into the woods     Backpacks LOADED with fish...   disgusting."
806814,misfish,2013-09-08 16:40:00,29133,I dont dought it. It is real bad. I was just pointing out that some of them dont always throw the roe away.
806815,Twocoda,2013-09-08 16:46:00,4130,i guess some peeps make soup out of the heads...no desire to ever try it and i have actually tried muskrat before (dont recommend it )
806833,ehg,2013-09-08 19:17:00,2666,"Being from Quebec and of Eastern European descent, can't help but to find this generalization to be quite racially offensive.  Usually  the local-yocal 'whities' are leading the slaughter of these near dead black boots. Geez!"
806835,Terry,2013-09-08 19:28:00,14456,now I'm offended  lol
806836,redpearl99,2013-09-08 19:39:00,259,please stop posting in my thread if you're going to drag this off topic into a race argument.  I'm interested in the location of cleaning stations for the simple reason that I want to know where I can easily clean fish without having to mess up my kitchen.  I don't have a tailgate and am not interested in looking for roe.
806837,BillM,2013-09-08 19:41:00,17367, I think you should spend some more time on the riverbanks during salmon season.
806838,misfish,2013-09-08 19:49:00,29133," Bill Bill Bill,you did cross the line. You cant tell me Italians dont do wrong. Come on now. Play nice.."
806840,Richie Razor,2013-09-08 20:44:00,536," So your plan is when you catch a fish to drive to a cleaning station so that you can clean your fish? Seriously buddy, clean them at home like everyone else."
806842,frodobuggins,2013-09-08 20:50:00,127,"Fish cleaning stations are a good place to gather decent fertilizer. I too would like to know the location of them. AND, if any of you out there would lend me your truck for an afternoon...don't worry, i will hose it down."
806848,MJL,2013-09-08 21:33:00,2427," They’ve evolved in Port Hope Bill...Now they’re slitting bucks looking for roe and leaving them on the ground    Ever consider one of these?  http://www.amazon.com/Portable-Camp-Cleaning-Table-Faucet/dp/B00AM23N3M  Set one up in the backyard, attach a hose and you’ve got a cleaning station. With gas at $1.30/L nowadays, it’ll save you from having to drive to Port Credit or Port Hope just to clean fish."
806853,davey buoy,2013-09-08 21:48:00,5505,"That's quite the cleaning table Mike!,I could see a couple other uses for it as well."
806856,redpearl99,2013-09-08 21:59:00,259,"  That's a good idea, but I live in a small downtown toronto condo so there isn't any real room to even clean a fish on the tiny kitchen counter.   So i take it that port hope and port credit are the only close by cleaning stations?"
806859,BillM,2013-09-08 22:07:00,17367," It was a joke man, come on, lol!   You ready for all the crazy Italians to come up from the city during hunting season???   :)"
806880,misfish,2013-09-09 00:23:00,29133, No worries here. I walk to far from the road.LMAO
806886,chessy,2013-09-09 00:41:00,610,"port hope cleaning station is broke .. they still let you clean fish but idiots drag fish up and down river so the fish is covered in stones then they throw the carcass in garbarotor with stones, the garbrator cant do stones lol... also if some of you read the regulations for eating fish you would not be eating them, anything over 20 inches should not be eaten by woman and children under 15 and anything over 30 inches should not be consumed at all.  and it is against the law to throw your fish over the side of boat or in the river .. and port hope just past by law stating if you get caught throwing fish on the bank or parts of it , you will be charged with littering"
806980,Governator,2013-09-09 19:24:00,879,"Open the garage door, put a scrap piece of wood on the work bench turn on rock 95 and start slicin'  EDIT: Sorry the above is what I do.  Is it the smell that bothers you or just the mess?   Can't you just lay some newspapers on a kitchen table?  Put a bowl of water for rinsing and a garbage bag beside you.  As soon as you're done toss the newspapaer in the bag and chuck it down your garbage chute.  I find its more of a mess to batter and cook them then to clean them lol."
