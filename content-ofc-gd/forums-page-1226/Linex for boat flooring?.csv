65558,wkrp,2007-04-28 15:37:00,656,The carpeting on my boat floor is beginning to show its wear. When the time came I was thinking of replacing it with marine vinyl flooring but I am now looking at the possibilityof having it sprayed with linex . Any body  have any experience with this product?
65572,BryonG,2007-04-28 17:35:00,52,It should work well. I know of several guys who used to (paint) their floors with a slip resistant product that seemed very similar 20+ years ago
65574,SlowPoke,2007-04-28 17:44:00,2984,I know a bunch of guys that did it to the interior floors in Jeeps. The smell never quie goes away but it was effective.

65619,taper,2007-04-28 21:34:00,611,I have seen it done and it works but make sure you stay with a light colour. Also if you portage your boat or man handle it at times it can add a bit of weight.
