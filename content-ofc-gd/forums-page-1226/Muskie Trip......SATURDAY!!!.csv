65289,dustink,2007-04-27 12:57:00,526,"For Christmas, I got my dad and I a guided Muskie trip with Mike Hulbert (www.mikehulbert.com).  Mike fishes here in Northern Indiana in the Spring & Fall on Webster & Tippy Lakes, and the Barbie Chain and last year he put over 260 fish in the boat with the average size just under 40"".  Well tomorrow is the day, and will be the first time either of us has fished for muskie.  It's been over 15 years since my dad & I were in a boat together, and he really doesn't fish much.  I'm really hoping he ties into a hog, but regardless I'm looking forward to the day.  His health is on the decline (a genetic family disease), and he's probably not going to be here in 5 years, so it's all about the memories...nothing more!  I'm hoping this turns into a yearly event......  It'll be Tuesday before I can post a report, as I'm taking Monday off to work on the house we just bought, but here's hoping I'll have something great to report (I know I will regardless).  Good luck to all you fishing the trout open'er...but C'MON MUSKIE!  dk"

No way I'm sleeping.....report / pics on Tuesday!  dk"
65416,nofrills,2007-04-27 19:27:00,89,"Mike is a fantastic Musky fisherman, he really knows his stuff. You will definately have a great time, and prolly learn more in 1 day that most would in a lifetime! See if you can get him to do the Weagle dance for you"

You probably got all the bases covered.....I'd like to add just one.......... Make sure your camers batteries are charged and you have extra.........for your sake, not ours here on the board. Enjoy, enjoy and great fishing luck to the both of you,..this is exellence in the making."

65496,Rizzo,2007-04-28 02:06:00,4754,Musky fishing already eh?  Guess I need to head to the states for a fix!  Good luck to you both.  Best thing about fishing is you usually come away with great memories regardless of how much (or little) you caught.
65532,Rich Clemens,2007-04-28 09:45:00,3131,"The time on the water together Justin will far out-weigh any fish you may catch.  Make the most of it and hopefully your dad will have a great day and want to do it more often.  I wish you both the best of luck and, when you come back, share your experience.  Go get 'em guys !"
