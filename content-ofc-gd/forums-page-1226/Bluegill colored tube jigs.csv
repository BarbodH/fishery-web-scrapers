Don`t know if they would help you, or how close you are trying to match a bluegill`s color. Seems to me the grubs were available up to 5 inch.  I use Junebug a lot, purple with green glitter. Better for L/M than S/M on tribs of Erie and inland lakes, watermelon blue glitter a better choice for smallies on most lakes I have fished. Any color can have it`s days though."
