65247,Steelcat,2007-04-27 11:49:00,191,"I will suggest you to go to Golden Beach Resort http://www.goldenbeachresort.com.  They have an area for you to setup tents, restaurants, as well as boat rental. or You can try Serpent Mounds Park http://www.serpentmoundspark.com.  This place is for more serious camping people, no boat rental though."
65271,express168,2007-04-27 12:19:00,327,"Tower Manor Lodge has tenting and boat rentals, just outside Bewdley. There are alot of cottage resorts on the lake that should let you tent and rent you a boat."

65315,Blue_Axela,2007-04-27 14:28:00,88,"Before getting our own cottage, we've always rented from Springbank Camp (owned by Lyle and Myrna Brown) which is located in Roseneath (close to the middle of the lake).  They don't have a place to tent but they their cabins are pretty cheap ($25-$30/day/night) and the boat rentals are $50 + cost of gas.  The cabins aren't fancy but it has running water, toilet, showers, kitchen and most important of all in April/May, a wood stove."
65317,Whopper,2007-04-27 14:31:00,2174,One of the places that steelcat suggested is Serpent Mounds pretty nice place close to some good fishing and there a place called Anglers Retreat on the same road on the way in that will rent you a boat.  Good Luck!  Whopper
