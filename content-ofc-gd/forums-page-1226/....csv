I just got a call from the surgeons office, my Surgery has been cancelled yet again  mine as well as three others... this is this crap has been going on since September... Needless to say I am seeing red... Hope the surgeon enjoys his long weekend  Wait times down my ass!!!  Gerritt."

HH"
65324,Beans,2007-04-27 15:20:00,3339,I can emphasize with you pal...it took 14 months from the time the sawbones said I needed an operation for the bulging disc in my back 'til the deed was done...  It is good that fishing taught us patience...  Hang in there !
65327,Joey,2007-04-27 15:23:00,9122,Well that's a bummer Gerritt.  Can't find good help these days eh  I think you should have a few beers tonight to drown you sorrows  Joey
65333,pikehunter,2007-04-27 15:38:00,1659,"Sorry to hear it was canceled...Remind me please, was this a carpal tunnel operation?  Getting old and forgetful I guess."
65336,Terry,2007-04-27 15:45:00,14456,I guess I will hold off saying good luck...till it happens  well maybe good luck fishing or whatever you are doing instead
65346,Bernie,2007-04-27 16:14:00,3190,Geez Gerritt..that sucks  . Sorry for you. Hope they get it done for you soon.
65430,huntervasili,2007-04-27 20:24:00,1604,"so theyre taking off teh hand instead eh? lol j/k man good luck, they know what theyre doing"
65452,Clampet,2007-04-27 22:44:00,1947,"Hope it goes without a hitch.  Jest wonderin' I just have to ask..  How does a guy who has a bad hand, still manage to squeeze the bejesus out of your hand.  I found out at the Fishing for Tyler event.  When I mentioned to him, he had a grip like Vise Grip, he replied proudly it was his bad hand, not his ""good hand"".  I have a sore left arm, which causes my hand to be very weak because of the pain. Theres' no way I could excert any pressure shaking someones' hand by any more than what a 3 year old kid could excert."
65453,Gerritt,2007-04-27 22:56:00,6129,LOL... That was my bad hand Clamp-it and I wasnt trying to squeeze yah!  As for why I was able to shake your hand.... It is my wrist that is screwed not my fingers or palm when you shake a persons hand you generally use the whole arm (in an up and down motion) therefore putting very little stress on the wrist.  Years of hard work do that to a guy I guess.   Thanks again everyone!   Gerritt.
65454,misfish,2007-04-27 23:03:00,29133,Yep Gerritts one of those young strong fellas.
65515,Gerritt,2007-04-28 02:54:00,6129,"Heya PH,  I broke a couple bones in my wrist that have not healed as of yet... 6 months and counting... I was unable to work in construction any longer (I was off for what seemed like forever) and wound up taking a new job and a new path in life.... perhaps this was a blessing in disguise as I love my new job and the people that come along with it! I honestly could not ask for a better boss that being said.. I just want this whole thing behind me.. I was nervous last night and have been nervous from the day I got the appointment but last night was the worst (as were the other nights for the other appointments) I wasnt able to eat or drink and was up all night... (Yes my nerves get the best of me) only to be called 45 minutes before I was supposed to arrive there. The tough part? not being able to have my morning coffee... man was I miserable! LOL  I asked why my surgery was cancelled this was the answer"" I ahve been seeing alot of this lately"" this is complete crap  I have talked to a few government officials today and have tried to talk to the president of HHSC (Hamilton Health Sciences Corporation)  and will hopefully gain a bit of headway over the next little bit. Like I said I just want to be better and have full use of my hands. I am not one for taking pills and have dealt with this without the need for painkillers (No beer is not a pain killer lol ) but I am starting to crack a little bit as the constant pain and discomfort is becoming a little to much.. While I am strong willed and hate pills... the need for relief is starting to creep more and more into my mind.  have a great night PH and thanks for asking!  Gerritt.  "
