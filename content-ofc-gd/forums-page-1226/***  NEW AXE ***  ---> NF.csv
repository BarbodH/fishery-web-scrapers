65176,JEREMY,2007-04-27 01:39:00,300,Nice it will be nice to play around with it around the ceement pond eh.
65217,jediangler,2007-04-27 04:45:00,1923,"Hey Clamp-It, I figured you for more of a Banjo guy. Don't know why, just did. Nice weapon, gotta love the Sunburst paint."
65225,Big Cliff,2007-04-27 10:02:00,6899,"Heck, when I saw the title of the thread ""New Axe"", I thought it was going to be about something useful like for splitting wood. That thing wouldn,t last one swing but I'll bet she'd burn good once you got her going!  Looks like a nice toy!"
65255,ccmtcanada,2007-04-27 12:02:00,7971,Nice lookin guitar there!  I'm sure you'll have lots of fun playing around with it!
65277,Mike the Pike,2007-04-27 12:30:00,3421,Nice looking Axe there Jed.Will you be playing some bluegrass music for us
65284,Bob,2007-04-27 12:52:00,370,"Nice guit-fiddle.  Laney amp is a little scary, they make nice sound but hard to find repairs.  I have a Laney mixer and can't find parts for it.  Blew the outputs.  Might have something to do with living out here in the boonies but no one around here seems to be able to get a line on parts."
65290,pikehunter,2007-04-27 12:59:00,1659,Wooooooo Doggy!  Nice lookin' Lektric Geetar there Jed! Now is Granny gunna be playin' da fiddle wit ya? And Jethro on da banjo. You gunna make Earl and Skrugs jealous wit dat.
65381,BryonG,2007-04-27 17:51:00,52,Earl was Scruggs....Lester Flatt was his partner .
65391,POLLIWOGG,2007-04-27 18:18:00,835,Best investment you can make.
65443,Clampet,2007-04-27 22:06:00,1947,"Thanks to all who replied and shared my joy. Some of you guys really know a lot about the Beverley Hillbillies episodes re: the Earl and skrugs stuff an all.  I intend to play a little more often, as I used to own accoustics, but found them a little demanding on the tennis elbow type syndrome which made it difficult to do bar chords for any lenght of time.  Maybe, I'll post a little U-Tube later, a la CCMT."
65458,danbo,2007-04-27 23:18:00,2646,"Shucks..ya gotta get a Fender next, Pa!"
65460,Gerritt,2007-04-27 23:34:00,6129,"Thats a nice one.... but I am partial to this one...She is a one of a kind called ""steampunk""      Gerritt."
65512,pikehunter,2007-04-28 02:34:00,1659," OK, thanks for te clarification.  Guess I'll just put my ol' hat on my head and go have me a swig of Grannie's shine"
