Was cruising through CTC tonight looking for scotchbrite pads and aluminum cleaner to fix up my pedastal bases when in the fishing section way down at the bottom I was suprised to see small 4"" Pro Troll flashers with the Echips.  If any of you salmon guys watched the US websites last year you know that the Echip flashers were absolutely deadly. I managed to give 1 a shot last year and did hook into some fish. On a US site from Eastern Ontario I found some information from several captains who were using the small 4"" ProTroll Echip with a coho sized fly as a cheater line last year for bows. There success was very impressive.  Just a quick FYI for anyone looking to add to the arsenal. They had at the Oakville strore, and I do mean HAD 2 colors to choose from. Silver/Silver tape and Silver/Watermelon"
