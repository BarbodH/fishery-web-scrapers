65482,FISHINGNUT,2007-04-28 01:11:00,253,"Iam looking at purchasing a drift sock it suggests a 36"" sock would do for a 16-18 foot boat but I have the chance to purchase a 48"" sock rated for a 22-26foot boat for $15.00 cheaper than the smaller sock.My boat is a 17.6 foot fish and  ski  so do you think the 48"" is to big ?I do alot of drift fishing for walley and bass so I thought the slower the better would improve fishing.Thanks"
65514,jediangler,2007-04-28 02:52:00,1923,Slower the better is right. I'm using one that is rated for a 14' boat on a 14' Sportspal canoe. They're also great for musky fishing. You can cover an area with more casts per drift casting bucktails if you are going slower.
65519,taper,2007-04-28 03:54:00,611,I would suggest get the smaller one and when funds will allow buy a second smaller one. In case it is not very windyyou won't need the large one and with two you can control the drift much better.
