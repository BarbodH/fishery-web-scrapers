64996,mikeymikey,2007-04-26 17:54:00,376,Hello again?  I am looking for purchase a my ever Baitcast reel & rod combo   and I have no idea what to look for what to get. On top of that I am cheap and I am not as hardcore as some of you. My budget is limited to $150 (after tax if possible). Another thing I do prefer is left-hand retrieve reel.  Any recommendation as to which brand/combo to get and where to buy from. (local shop would be prefered)   Thank you!
65003,ssauvain,2007-04-26 18:18:00,77,Go to Bass Pro shops at this location. This is a bionic blade 79.00 fantastic rod..I have 3. Teamed up with a Abu Garcia Revo reel.

65104,mikeymikey,2007-04-26 22:48:00,376,Nice but gone way over my budget.
65158,JEREMY,2007-04-27 01:06:00,300,I picked up a bps extreme combo at the spring sale and just love it. If it is in your price range its a a great deal.
65218,sturgman,2007-04-27 04:59:00,249,I was in the same boat a while back when i got hooked on Musky fishing. I purchased a new abu garcia 5600 series baitcater on ebay for $65 bucks shipping included and bought a bass pro shop 7 ft. heavy action baitcaster rod at the store.. Awesome reel and I have been happy with the rod also. Best money I have ever spent on gear i must say!!
65231,hawg_hauler,2007-04-27 10:48:00,69,I am pretty sure that you can get a Shimano Citica with a decent BPS rod for a good deal. The Citica has come a long way in design and I believe you wouldn't be disappointed.
65297,Blake,2007-04-27 13:11:00,418,For your price range check out Fishing World.  They have a nice baitcasting reel on sale for $70 not sure if it comes in left hand though.  They also have some Pfluegar reels with a Shimano Convergence rod which would be right in your price range!!!!!!!  They have a huge sale going on that ends Sunday so I am sure they could hook you up.
65355,Guest lundboy,2007-04-27 16:43:00,0,"Being that you are new to baitcasting, whatever reel you get make sure it has a good adjustable centrifical brake or magnetic brake system.  It will help you learn to cast without too many bird's nests.  The BPS $79 rod in a Medium Heavy action is not bad, but I find them a little top heavy...  Take a look at the Berkley Lightning Rods as well for $49, they are a good solid rod and a little lighter,  then pick the best reel you can find for the balance of your money.  Then practice practice practice!  http://www.berkley-fishing.com/prod.php?k=.../PURLRC661M.jpg  http://www.basspro.com/webapp/wcs/stores/s...t=SearchResults"

65383,snag,2007-04-27 17:54:00,1932, I agree.  I would use ALL your cash on the baitcaster and wait for the rod to come on sale.
