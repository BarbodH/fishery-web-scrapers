65517,chilli,2007-04-28 03:10:00,199,From pos to pos is now allowed. Read your newest OOD mag for details. It's all in the hotwire section. Don't see that section? join the OFAH
65521,Roy,2007-04-28 04:32:00,13728,I like OOD but I didn't think that they were the authority where Ontario MNR rulings were concerned. I didn't see anything on the MNR site.
65522,irishfield,2007-04-28 04:57:00,26272,"Ditto to what Roy said and I shouldn't have to join a private organization to see what is happening in our public fishery.  Sounds like a case of the OMNR giving in.... to speed up the VHS spread process and to appease the ""economy"". They know it's in many lakes so why slow it's spread down at the expense of anyone's lively hood."
