When we took the screw out we discovered no o ring so I was quite surprised because we cracked it last year after i had drove it twice on the water to check the oil it was welded on there. Wasn't ran after that. When we did crack the screw off last year he had to give it a bang with a hammer. I'm thinking that the aluminum and steel screw had some sort of reaction that sealed it PHEW!! I know this happens becuase I have aluminum rims and the lugs sometimes give me a time because they almost weld themselves on there. Oil looked awesome that came out just like the oil I put in    Also installed a kicker mount for my 9.9 yammie to go on gonna take some pics of her tommorrow and put em up to see how I did and see some ideas on how I can control kicker motor with steering wheel. CHEERS.....
