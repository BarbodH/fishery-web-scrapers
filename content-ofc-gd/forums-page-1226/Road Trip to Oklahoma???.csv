65339,muskymatt,2007-04-27 15:54:00,2608,Big hungry aggressive fish for sure      This ten-foot alligator gar was caught and photographed at Moon Lake in Mississippi in 1910.  Matt
64488,silveradosheriff,2007-04-25 12:01:00,1025,I'll tell you what....     
64529,Motorhead,2007-04-25 13:27:00,163,That is one nasty looking fish...  Just make sure you don`t fall overboard....   Doug
64533,Terry,2007-04-25 13:38:00,14456,"I think I would want that thing..dead, shot, beheaded, gutted, shot again, then roped..then maybe I might bring it onto my boat..."
64615,fishindevil,2007-04-25 15:47:00,6254,"Holy crap...thats one huge gar.  ..  ..what does that thing eat???? and man is that one ugly fish for sure,how did they catch that thing.  ..man oh man....cheers"
64616,mrdylan,2007-04-25 15:49:00,111,Wow dunno what to say about that one. Thing is huge!!!
64617,easton13th,2007-04-25 15:49:00,371,WOW! What a fish! I bet it was an interesting fight!
64625,silveradosheriff,2007-04-25 16:03:00,1025,Could you imagine that hitting a topwater?  Yikes!
64641,Hookset,2007-04-25 17:02:00,367,I wonder how many people have lost pets that thought they just ran away from home. Would like to see what they find inside that thing. Maybe Jimmy Hoffa. Sure wouldnt be dangling my toes off the end of the dock on that Lake.  Hookset
64645,Cast-Away,2007-04-25 17:17:00,790,"I recognize those two guys. That is Billy and Bob, aka Billybob!"
64660,Patches,2007-04-25 17:59:00,48," Judging by the Compound bows in the 1st picture, I'd say they got the ""shot"" part done."
64675,mattyk,2007-04-25 19:18:00,2110,That thing is scarry lookin! Must put up a mean fight!
64688,GbayGiant,2007-04-25 20:37:00,1780,"Those things are nuts, they can breath out of water to, look like dinosaurs."
64706,mepps,2007-04-25 21:40:00,1301,what a beauty!
64754,Greencoachdog,2007-04-25 23:46:00,8163,They're usually caught on line and tackle with heavy Deep sea tackle... and a nice lively 20 lb. Muskie would be a good bait!
64759,mrdylan,2007-04-26 00:02:00,111,Been doin some searchin these things are crazy!! The Roe is poison to man and the biggest one caught ever was in 1910 and was over 10 feet long according to wikipedia http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7...ligator_gar.jpg  Insane.
64807,little angler,2007-04-26 02:09:00,128,what the hell is it ?L0L
64832,OhioFisherman,2007-04-26 04:59:00,6623,Did they eat it? Doesn`t look like they were set up for C&R.
64835,Dano,2007-04-26 09:45:00,719,"dang rednecks, those big ones are getting rare. No need to kill them."
64840,JerseyDog,2007-04-26 10:21:00,190,"You might be the first person to ever suggest actually going TO Oklahoma.  If you want to whet your teeth on gar, you should start with GBay. There is schools of four footers there and I don't think they could bite your entire hand off. They are however very hard to catch. I've bonked tons of them on the head with every lure & bait imaginable and only ever got one up to the boat and that was a fluke with a worm and a hook (and he spit the hook as soon as he was boatside which honestly, was fine by me)."
65121,mrdylan,2007-04-26 23:09:00,111,  Eat it? would be like buying half a cow!! You could freeze half of it and eat off of it for ages.
65151,Bitsmith2k,2007-04-27 00:37:00,396,"i think they do eat them, or at least sell the meat off them..  if this is wrong i'll remove the link, but a guy from work sent this to me a while ago, they have videos of fishing gar with a bow and arrow... i know they used to have free video samples on their site..  www.garguys.com"
65161,mrdylan,2007-04-27 01:22:00,111,  From the photos there it almost looks like they hook them first then shoot them with a Bow. Sorry guys that seems wrong to me on so many levels.  Neither fishing or hunting. Might as well go down to your local Zoo and shoot them in the cages.
65286,OhioFisherman,2007-04-27 12:54:00,6623,"No problems with me, different people are into different things, just not something I would do. If I want to fish I got rods and reels. LOL"
65304,wildminnow,2007-04-27 13:21:00,27,"Wow I really get tired of all the high and mighty talk on these boards.  I'm sure this fish was taken by a legal method according to oklahoma conservation dept. regulations.  These departments are set up to protect the wildlife, so If according to them it is legal everyone else should get over it, and leave these guys alone"
65313,mrdylan,2007-04-27 13:47:00,111,"Not high and mighty just ""my"" opinion I even said sorry before I typed it. I did some searching and these Alligator Gar seem to be close to endangered not sure how old that info was though.  I follow the laws and respect most of them but I don't agree with alot of them so just because it is the law doesn't make it right from a moral view point in this case it is my view nothing more. Some one busted for serious Piracy for instance can do more real time in jail  than a pedophile or a bank robber.  As above differen't strokes for differen't folks. No biggie."
