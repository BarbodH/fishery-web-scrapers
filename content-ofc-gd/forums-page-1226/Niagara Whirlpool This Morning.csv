64912,solopaddler,2007-04-26 14:57:00,8605,"Well, I set out alone early this morning to fish the whirlpool and was met with this sight when I arrived    All that white stuff is ice chunks  Here's a couple more shots of the ice     Went for a walk and almost stepped into this!    This guy seemed to be disgusted with the ice too    His partner found a perfect spot for a nest, safe from predators...    A couple of cool shots       So I saw some nice scenery and had a nice hike, but no fish today But then it's not really about the catching anyway is it?  In all honesty the river wasn't completely unfishable. If was willing to time my drifts and put in my time I likely could have scratched out a couple, but I just didn't have it in me today  .  Yard work is beckoning anyway....time to break out the rake!  cheers,  Mike"

65068,misfish,2007-04-26 21:40:00,29133,"One of my all time favorite spots. Love the walk down,but the walk back up,man,hasent anyone bought the rights for a chair lift yet.  Great photos .  Thanks for sharing."
65159,JEREMY,2007-04-27 01:14:00,300,From the reports i have seen from you i am sure you could have got a few.That is a long walk down there for nothing.I have only been there once but it was one hell of a walk back up.But at least it was a day out hope you had fun with the rake.
65163,Rich Clemens,2007-04-27 01:24:00,3131,"Cool pics Mike.   Been to Niagara a number of times, but I've never made the treck down into the gorge.  Looks very cool."
65171,bucktail,2007-04-27 01:36:00,1857,That really shows how late this spring is. Water temps in Ontario near Niagara are 8 degrees colder then last year at thhis time. The Niagara isnt a source of warm water yet. Wow!
