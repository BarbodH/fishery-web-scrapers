From what I can see it's not likely but from looking at some other boards, either guys are protecting their spots or they actually think that this is true.  I'm looking at the Bighead, Sauble, Notty, etc.  Anyways, just looking for some insight.  PM me if preferred.  Thanks in advance. Tim"

We just had another nice down pour here and they are calling for off and on showers through out the night.  Sorry the news wasnt better for ya.  Happy hooken
