We would like to enter the Orillia Perch Festival and were planning on stopping in at Trombly's first. We have a boat and would launch it near Orillia. Any tips on getting some action would be greatly appriciated.  Thanks and good luck to all you trout lovers this week-end.

Be careful, watch out for the yahoos in the bigger, faster boats and catch lots of perch! You and your son have a great day!"
