65353,ehg,2007-04-27 16:42:00,2666,Not sure about what you're exactly talking about but come Saturday you might want to look around the blue coloured creeks(cold-water) on this map. 
65354,charlied,2007-04-27 16:42:00,584,"Well I grew up in Norwood and fished almost all the creeks around there and most are full of chubs and bass, but there may be a few untapped gems there.....sorry I couldn't be of any help.  There is a trout pond in between Norwood and Havelock if its still there but it costs an arm and a leg to fish it!"
65370,dow33,2007-04-27 17:28:00,27,Hey EHG thanks for the map I will check out the cold water areas in the morning.

65431,charlied,2007-04-27 20:36:00,584,YES THERE IS........man I miss that place and the town.
65442,jediangler,2007-04-27 21:55:00,1923,I think there are lake trout in the south section of Jack's lake. Maybe the river running between Jack's and Stoney would have trout.
