Arrived there at around 1145, there were already 20 people lining up along the canal.  The fish were on and off, didn't catch any Crappies though, one of the guy beside me caught around 20+ baby size Crappies, too bad he didn't let them go... He's the only one who managed to catch that many Crappie.  From time to time we managed to catch some small Sunfish.  Right before we called it a day, my dad hooked up a 15 inches Pike.  I'd say it's a great way to end the day.  Now I am at home get prepare for tomorrow's season open for Rice Lake.  One of the tiny Sunfish we caught today.  The poor thing fell off my hand as I tried to turn on my camera.   Here's the 15 inches Pike "

At least we know that the crappie are still there. i'm heading to the bobcaygeon area tomorrow night to try and get into the bigger ones."
