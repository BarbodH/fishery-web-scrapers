65065,fishinfool,2007-04-26 21:19:00,366,"I have the weekend planned to go to Balsam Lake and do the Crappie opener, but looked at the weather report for the weekend and it looks like possible rain all weekend. My question to all the OFNers is, do Crappie bite when it's raining or do they just feed when it's sunny? I am hoping that a bunch of you will tell me ""you slayed em while it was raining"" LOL"
65100,fishinfool,2007-04-26 22:41:00,366,Anyone??
65105,Greencoachdog,2007-04-26 22:49:00,8163,"I've actually found that Crappie bite better during low light conditions. Early morning, late afternoon, and at night... so you might do well on a cloudy rainy day."
65106,misfish,2007-04-26 22:49:00,29133,"Ok Im going to fish in the rain aswell. Crappies and perch are on the menu. Go,have fun and report back,I will be."
65109,fishinfool,2007-04-26 22:55:00,366,"Okay guys, let's not forget that usually the weather is the exact opposite of what they call for soooooooo........... we could and should be fishing in 25c Sunny weather. lol  (Hope nobody on here is a weatherman) I will report with lots of pics.  Stan"
65113,fishinfool,2007-04-26 22:56:00,366," GCD I hope you are right, I will let you know.  Stan"
65114,douG,2007-04-26 22:57:00,2693,"Lookin' forward, as Barbara might say."
65115,Mako,2007-04-26 22:58:00,25,"The last few times I have been out around the opener its rained.  The bite was great ALL day, its like evening all the time.  Check the report & pics 13 and 14 inchers and rain  http://www.hookmorefish.com/phpBB/viewtopi...ghlight=crappie  BRING ON THE RAIN!  Just no wind."
65116,misfish,2007-04-26 22:58:00,29133, Barbara who?????????????????
65123,fishinfool,2007-04-26 23:14:00,366," Hey Mako Nice slabs, that first shot is huge!! Hopefully I do half as well. I am hoping they will be tight to the shallows where I got them last year, if not I have a couple of other shallow spots to try. I have never pursued them in any other depth, too much like work and as you said, ""very difficult"".  Misfish You took the words right out of my mouth. ""who the hell is Barbara?"""
65140,Beans,2007-04-27 00:04:00,3339,The number one reason for buying a rain suit...fishing in the rain...the crappie don't care if it's wet...  Thunderstorms...now that's a different kettle of fish...
65337,bbog,2007-04-27 15:46:00,665,Good to see results are possible in the rain. Committed to going tomorrow no matter what the weather. Will post results later..
65345,mattyk,2007-04-27 16:10:00,2110,i have done better for crappies when its cloudy and overcast.
65349,ehg,2007-04-27 16:32:00,2666,"Rain, sun or snow they should be biting shallow up there. Just use a microtube in some variation of white or so, under a small float, and you should get a good amount.  Trout, crappie or nothing not sure about this weekend myself.  Good luck Stan,  ehg"
65397,Rich,2007-04-27 18:26:00,3927,"No, they dont bite in the rain. They hate it when their food gets wet.  JK of course.. crappie fishing is great in the rain. The low light conditions allow you to use larger baits and call for a more agressive bite. Get R Done!"
