63609,graftongal,2007-04-23 11:45:00,145,"Yeah Pete, that Pierre guy looked familiar to me, but I couldn't quite put my finger on it. Must have been the French accent...  Now how about those legs!  "
63853,Pete Maina,2007-04-23 21:15:00,213,"Ah ha! That's what I been waitin' for.  (Thanks Sandy)  That's quite a sight isn't it ... stubby legs and knee-high stockings  Oh my ... yup, gotta hang the baits up high to be safe around this guy."

63898,GbayGiant,2007-04-23 22:17:00,1780,"Oh man, lol, I think that might be my new avatar Terry."
64045,Marc Thorpe,2007-04-24 10:14:00,621,"Now Terry thats Funny   although I seem to dance like a leprechaun Please a Red kilt will ya Oh Sandy,wait till you see my calves with my Red Kilt,even Anorld would be envious Be carefull,I might make you and Reefhawg wear kilts during your trip  Petee my little Pink Fuzyy ,Fury Twig, I cant just sense the envy in you  Roy,bet you never seen a Scotish French Canadian MacThorpie  I think we should get OFC Kilts for the OFC online Tourney"
64064,Pete Maina,2007-04-24 12:00:00,213,"Ha ha ... love it! The dancing Thorpie-dude(ette)  Miss MacThorpie surely does have some moves.  All Miss macThorpie needs now is a nice, pink, furry hat  I like the OFC kilt idea ... start a whole new trend in fishing ... the kilt nation ... always a new surprise in the boat"
64614,JenTavolacci,2007-04-25 15:47:00,68,"  Sorry Pete....had to toss a kilt on you, but at least its a camo one....I like the little purse in front!"
64845,Marc Thorpe,2007-04-26 10:49:00,621,"Now thats a first, a Norweigean in a kilt The purse just fits in with the pink fuzzy ,furry hat"
64888,JenTavolacci,2007-04-26 13:32:00,68,wait a minute....am I crazy or do those look like Dancing Fairies on Pete's kilt......????
64893,Roy,2007-04-26 13:46:00,13728,"It's a tactical illusion, Jen. It's a boating kilt, they're dancing ferries."
65170,JenTavolacci,2007-04-27 01:35:00,68,Good one!
65177,Clampet,2007-04-27 01:41:00,1947,Ah seen better legs on an ole Tomcat! 
62205,JenTavolacci,2007-04-19 16:08:00,68,OH MY!!! I love that dancing Pete!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
62210,Roy,2007-04-19 16:25:00,13728,"I'll bet Pete is sure glad that his name isn't ""Richard"" eh Jen?"
62272,Pete Maina,2007-04-19 19:34:00,213,Holy cow!!!  I see I've got my dancin' shoes on now ... amongst other things ... got some pretty good moves too. Thanks Terry ... you da magic man    (Boy that's an ugly dress though)  Pete
62373,JenTavolacci,2007-04-19 22:39:00,68,"Terry- I have to agree....one ugly dress. Maybe you should have stuck with PINK, that is obviously is Pete's color.  -Jen"
62378,Roy,2007-04-19 22:43:00,13728,I love Rake n' Roll music.
62439,Dano,2007-04-20 00:15:00,719,"LOL, this thread is a classic!! Thanks to all for being good eggs about it. Well done Pete!"
62442,Pete Maina,2007-04-20 00:19:00,213,"Ha ha ... rake and roll lives on.  Not a problem at all Dano. YOU folks are a fun group ... maybe I'll get some more photos taken with my new hat ... kinda like it sez in the song ""test the water's edge with my fishin pole"""
62594,JenTavolacci,2007-04-20 03:25:00,68,WHERE is Marc on this thread?????? I thought he'd be all over it!!!  -Jen
62598,Moosebunk,2007-04-20 03:32:00,3970,"The Pete dood is skinnier than I thought.  Couldn't tell him apart from the rake. lol.  Must be all the musky, drugs and rock and roll."
62602,kennyman,2007-04-20 04:02:00,737,"How about ""Dancing Pete"" in a Johnsonville Brats commercial?? Wonder if they'd go for that. I'm pretty sure you could use it for a hydroponics commercial LOL   ."
62621,graftongal,2007-04-20 10:15:00,145,"I thought it was ""Pierre"" that did the brats commercials? And you mean to tell me it is actually Pete?  I must say Pete, you are one of few men who can pull of a pink hat without looking too ""feminine"". The dress though, that is another story!  Marc's computer must be down, or else he's putting together a really good response!"
62685,Pete Maina,2007-04-20 14:42:00,213,"HI,  Had to stop in here to check to see what else may have happened.  Bunk, it's just the clothes that make me look skinny. I'm not so sure on the commercial deal ... as the lady sez, the dress would have to go, I think. Now, a more masculine kilt maybe (I know Thorpie has got a couple he wears around the house).  Who's this Pierre guy?"
62702,bigbuck,2007-04-20 15:29:00,2449,"Now, will that hat be a good luck charm out on the water Pete?? I'd love to see a pic of you holding a 50+ incher wearing that hat, strum that banjo, never mind the rake. I see it now in neon lights, ""Pete Maina, the Muskie and Roller..........."""
62706,graftongal,2007-04-20 15:38:00,145," You know, Pierre! The guy with the 'stache!  Cripes, remind me not to drop anything on the floor when I'm at Thorpe's this year! I wouldn't want to know whether or not he wears underbritches with it!"
62745,Marc Thorpe,2007-04-20 17:58:00,621,"I always knew he was a candidate for the Pride Parade  You would look good on float  Been off line for week or more,they put twin  V8 360s in my pc, ,we are peeling out"
62749,Pete Maina,2007-04-20 18:24:00,213,"So Sandy, are you saying you recognized this Pierre guy? ... you must get that Versus station. Hey, be careful about that Sandy ... he's close to the ground certainly, but it is still a dangerous deal if you drop something all the way to the floor.  Ah ha ... so Thorpie is finally out of the woodwork following a major PC overhaul ... hey Thorpie, you gonna provide a pic with that kilt? Terry needs something to work with"
62751,Terry,2007-04-20 18:33:00,14456,if we can find the right picture of him  we can add a kilt or anything else...lol
62760,Marc Thorpe,2007-04-20 19:04:00,621," Ya Moose,If I grabbed him in an arm bar,I snap his spine the twig he is Looks like like he is getting raked just like in the photo"
62845,JenTavolacci,2007-04-20 23:43:00,68,my contribution....  
62875,Daplumma,2007-04-21 00:54:00,1961,That looks a bit like TJ's outfit....This thread just getss sillier by the day! Joe
62882,Terry,2007-04-21 01:01:00,14456,"nice, should we make it dance.....lol"
62918,Crazyhook,2007-04-21 02:23:00,1154,Jen that one is classic!!! would love to add pete to the ChrisS grass pic...
62923,JenTavolacci,2007-04-21 02:30:00,68,Make him dance! Make him dance!!!!
62967,Marc Thorpe,2007-04-21 09:36:00,621,"Now thats as romo as you get,should be the cover of the next EA mag Pete could start a new show Queer eye for the muskie guy or instead of the Next Bite it could be called  The Next Night  Jamie your right Pete across the grass  bwahahahahah You gotta do it  Hey Petee ,just remember it takes a real man to wear a kilt You are wearing a TUTU"
62992,Crazyhook,2007-04-21 12:52:00,1154,OK I will tonight...  I will send to you to post Marc!!
61845,JenTavolacci,2007-04-18 22:58:00,68,"Hi everyone-  Pete had put up a post a couple of days ago about a fishing song from Schramband. The song - Now We're Fishin' can be downloaded from our homepage at www.PeteMaina.com  Anyway, Pete received a Schramband hat and we took some SUPER funny pictures of him wearing it....we thought you would get a kick out seeing them, so here they are!   -Jen    "
61847,Dano,2007-04-18 23:04:00,719,"Hey, that guy looks like a good egg, can he catch fish?"
61856,Terry,2007-04-18 23:15:00,14456,that looks like an 8 beer hat     I would have to be on my eighth beer to put on a hat like that  but it works for him   LOL
61866,GbayGiant,2007-04-18 23:30:00,1780,
61867,Tybo,2007-04-18 23:31:00,1373,"Will the true, Peter Frampton please stand up?"
61880,Pete Maina,2007-04-18 23:55:00,213,"HI,  Just got a note from Jennifer that she put this up here.  I need her help with stuff like that cuz I'm a computer dope. (Years ago I had to read the instructions with my first pair of oars ... with help, I figured it out ... got darn good at it too.)  Anyway, yeah, I really thought you Canucks would all like to see my new look. These pics are from spring raking, of course, but I'm thinking be good boat attire too  It would require 8 beers Terry? Ha ... I did it sober with no problem. Darn good-lookin' hat I think.  Not certain if that guy can catch fish or not ... we'll have to see  Pete"
61882,Roy,2007-04-18 23:59:00,13728,"You can get at least a dozen good sized jigs out of that hat, Pete. No telling what you could do with the lining.   ps. Jen's a keeper."
61896,Roy,2007-04-19 00:12:00,13728,uh-oh. I see Jen's online...I'd better pipe down.
61897,JenTavolacci,2007-04-19 00:12:00,68,"Ggggs Roy, I was hoping that when he was done wearing it around the yard that he might give it to me! Although, he sure seems to like it and may not give it up!  Jen"
61900,Daplumma,2007-04-19 00:21:00,1961,With that hat and TJ's Tutu you never know what could happen.Must be something in that water north of here. Joe
61930,Pete Maina,2007-04-19 00:59:00,213,TJ's Tutu?  
61949,Dano,2007-04-19 01:31:00,719,"yea, its a dead match for sure. Terry? Would you honour us by doing some of your photo magic? It just begs to be done, no?"
61955,Roy,2007-04-19 01:44:00,13728,"Terry doesn't need to work his magic...I have the original pic taken 6 years ago of TJ in a tutu,"
61965,Terry,2007-04-19 01:55:00,14456,
61968,Joey,2007-04-19 01:58:00,9122,Those are hilarious Jen.  And nice job Terry  Joey
61976,Roy,2007-04-19 02:06:00,13728,WOW!  Pete now looks like a Leafs fan!
62000,Pete Maina,2007-04-19 02:33:00,213,"Ha ha ... so that's TJ's tutu?  So, Roy, where's this original for comparison?  Actually, all-together, a pretty good-lookin' outfit. Anyone think it might scare muskies?  And TJ, if you can send me that dress of yours (fast-mail), I could use it turkey hunting next week. Seems to me it would be better than camo.  Pete"
62003,TJQ,2007-04-19 02:35:00,7806,sorry... ive got a date in matachewan with my tutu.. lol.. nice hat...
62065,Dano,2007-04-19 10:11:00,719,Sweeeet!!!!LOL
62077,Pete Maina,2007-04-19 11:08:00,213,OH well ... you're gonna have to let me know where I can get a hold of my own TJ ... hate to see you get all the dates.
62128,Squid,2007-04-19 12:56:00,1656,Nice hat
62158,kennyman,2007-04-19 14:38:00,737,That's a good look bud. You should try it for the show! Not so sure about the dresses though LOL.
62180,Crazyhook,2007-04-19 15:30:00,1154,Is this a Pete Photoshop contest???  
62199,Pete Maina,2007-04-19 15:50:00,213,"Ha ha ... yeah, the hat may work for the show (and can always steal from it a little for building baits)-but you're right that the dress may be a little much. Could get in the way. Althought these fancy-Frampton-britches may work?"
62203,Terry,2007-04-19 16:05:00,14456,
