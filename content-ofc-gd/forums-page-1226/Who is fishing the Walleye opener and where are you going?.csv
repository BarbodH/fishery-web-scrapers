64911,Cast-Away,2007-04-26 14:50:00,790,"I personally am going to head up to the Moon Basin on GBay May 6th to try for the elusive eye's. I know that it is real hit and miss up there, but like to give it another try every few years. Often to opener is too late there because the fish have moved out and are hard to locate, but this year everything is really late, so I am hoping to nail them near the spawning areas."
