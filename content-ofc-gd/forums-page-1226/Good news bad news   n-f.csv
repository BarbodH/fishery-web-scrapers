65423,Nanook,2007-04-27 19:50:00,565," Had an ear infection for some time now, and finally got to the Specialist after 10 wks. Found the infection is in the inner ear, [i 'blew the ear drum yrs ago] Apparently, once the infection is cleared up, he can operate and restore most of the hearing in that ear. Had a new eardrum put in 25yrs ago but it let go, and they said then,it coud'nt be done again. Thats the GOOD news  The BAD news is I might be able to hear all the Bull that goes on around me!"
