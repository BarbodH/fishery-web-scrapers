I'm looking for what model you use with which diver (#0, #1).  I want to try this out on Erie for walleye and steelhead.  TIA!.  Patrick.d "
933858,Sinker,2015-09-12 13:58:00,8692,They will pull any size dipsy. Great rods.  S.
933873,duke01,2015-09-12 14:44:00,20,"We use almost all Talora rods on our boat for Erie and Lake Ontario fishing. I like the medium heavies and think the mediums pull to hard. (just my two cents but i have fished both) The medium is fine for walleye because it is like hauling in a bucket of sand. However, if you are ever going to use Mag Dipsy's and you have a big salmon or bow on you will be happy for the extra back bone. Again this is just my two cents and i am sure others prefer the mediums."
933894,NANUK,2015-09-12 17:57:00,797,"I prefer medium for a wire diver, I like the flex in medium rod since wire has no stretch, Talora roller rod with a swivel tip is an awesome rod and can handle any size diver. Daiwa Heartland wireline rods with roller guides and a swivel tip are another good choice, if you can find one. I prefer them over Taloras."

933974,KraTToR,2015-09-12 23:10:00,506,"I don't think I've ever set a dispy on a 1 or 0 setting, lol. I meant the model/size.  0 or 1.. Agreed, I see little reason to not have it pull away from the boat."
933978,John Bacon,2015-09-12 23:35:00,3277,"I meant the model/size.  0 or 1.. Agreed, I see little reason to not have it pull away from the boat.  If you are running three or four dipseys than you need to run one inside of another buy running one on a '1' setting.  I guess if you wanted to run five you could run one straight back at '0'."
934093,Fisherpete,2015-09-13 16:47:00,1814,"I run the 9'6"" MH Taloras for dipseys when Lake Ontario salmon fishing. Love them. Run my dipseys on #2 setting the most often, gets them away from the boat and rigger lines and widens the spread of lures."
934238,fishindevil,2015-09-14 08:41:00,6254,I do use the okuma roller rods 9ft and they work awesome as well !!! No issues with any roller rods for my dipseys
