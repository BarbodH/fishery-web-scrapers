933351,Acountdeleted,2015-09-09 16:58:00,2562,"I have been thinking about this for a few years but never really thought to post this here. I don't know why.  My birthday is in a month and one of the things I have always wanted to do but was only able to once, and in Edmonton none the less, is to get in some good fishing on my birthday. I know October is too soon for ice fishing and I find bass exceptionally hard after the lakes turn over.  I imagine October is too late for spawning and running chinooks. Are walleye still plentiful on BOQ? Is there anything else anyone can reccomend? I've honestly been at a loss for ideas for 30 years now and am open to suggestions. ..... Do carp bite in fall?"
933357,John Bacon,2015-09-09 17:16:00,3277,"Chinooks should still be available for at least part of October.  The egg collection for Chinook is done in October, usually around Thanksgiving.  I don't think I would be keeping any for the table at that point, but they will be there."
933360,DRIFTER_016,2015-09-09 17:33:00,10439,"Chinooks should still be available for at least part of October.  The egg collection for Chinook is done in October, usually around Thanksgiving.  I don't think I would be keeping any for the table at that point, but they will be there.  Early steelhead, browns and coho's should be available as well. Quinte should be getting hot as well.  Up here in the North the big lakers and pike put on the feedbag then. I look forward to that time of year."
933382,porkpie,2015-09-09 19:42:00,2521,"Lots of steelhead to be had, pickeral fishing can be exceptional.  I love both, and often have a hard time choosing.  Should keep you busy!"
933384,Gallie,2015-09-09 19:54:00,1215,"Personally i love this time of year for pike fishing and now muskie as well, the boats are staying home the lakes are wide open and its hamner time! I find i get more smallies on simcoe while pike fishing this time of year as well so i would include that as an option. There is definitely good fishing to be had in the late fall and and sometimes better than any summer fishing."
933385,Old Ironmaker,2015-09-09 19:57:00,8243,October to me is the best for fishing. The Bay of Quinte is just warming up for hog Walleye. Bass here on Erie is lunker season. Pick your day for a personal best. No need for muffs and sunscreen. I love the fall. My favorite months.
933386,AKRISONER,2015-09-09 20:05:00,5558,"Halloween is like prime time fishing for walleye...its the one time of year that i consistently catch them on GB.   The goodness usually starts begining of october, peaks at halloween and then trails off as november runs, by early december it can be much slower."
933389,Joeytier,2015-09-09 20:17:00,3990,The lake your family cottage is on would be a great choice for fall musky!  Or come up here on the Ottawa riv.  Rivers don't turnover and the fishing can be dynamite in October...especially the burbot
933430,chris.brock,2015-09-09 22:37:00,4053,"Awesome time of year. There's lots of spots close to your parents cottage. Walleye, bass and muskie (maybe back lake brookies/ splake). If our schedules work, I'm only 20 minutes up the road too."
933469,Acountdeleted,2015-09-10 01:39:00,2562,"Awesome. Thanks for all the help guys. Chris, I'd love to meet sometime. I'm still kicking myself that I missed that ice fishing trip with you and Chris K last winter."
933480,OhioFisherman,2015-09-10 02:18:00,6623,"I agree with Old, Lake Erie can be hot for big smallies and walleye in October, some of the biggest of the year.  Here on the Ohio side we don't usually see any snow to speak of until around Thanksgiving in November, and some years after that. It is big water though, and prone to blow  when the gales of November come early.  Planning a trip here that time of year here puts you in the same position I had trying to plan a trip north in September, it's a long way to go to hit bad weather?  It was 90f here yesterday, and still around 80 at midnight, they are saying we could see temps in the 40's at night by the weekend. That will be our first major cold front of the end of summer season, it won't last, but that is what we always tried to time our guy trips north around.  Guys on the board used to do a BOQ thing in the fall? Big walleye there too."
933489,manitoubass2,2015-09-10 03:43:00,11391,My gawd october is deadly fishing almost everwhere!
933559,BowSlayer101,2015-09-10 16:53:00,296,"The rivers will be filled with kings and cohos, steel should be in by then as well as browns."
933570,Sinker,2015-09-10 17:31:00,8692,"Nobody has mentioned musky fishing in october yet?   Hmmm......maybe I should keep my lips sealed?   I dont fish much at all in the fall, I hunt. But I do make time for fall musky fishin.....its the best!!  S."

933640,manitoubass2,2015-09-11 01:00:00,11391,I fish right till freeze up.  It can be tough but some of the best walleye on the rivers come right around mid november!!!!
933642,manitoubass2,2015-09-11 01:00:00,11391,Almost nothing but tanks!
933673,mike rousseau,2015-09-11 04:49:00,4661,"On the St Lawrence walleye musky smallies and carp are all pretty good then... There's no ""turnover"" on the river so the fishing stays good all fall"
933735,msp,2015-09-11 19:59:00,1336,"In my opinion, October is the best time of year for multi species fishing. Almost everything is open. Most fish are feeding heavy in preparation for the winter months. Kawartha and Great Lakes Musky Smallmouth and largemouth bass almost anywhere Great lakes salmon and trout fishing can be really hot depending on rainfall If I could take time away from work and the family it would always be around the first or second week in October"
