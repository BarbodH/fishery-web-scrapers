The LaSalle, Quebec native is an 11-time Stanley Cup champion – winning eight times as a player, twice as an assistant general manager and once as a head coach. Lemaire is a two-time winner of the Jack AdamsTrophy as the NHL’s coach of the year and also won an Olympic gold medal with Team Canada while serving as an assistant with head coach Mike Babcock. “Obviously Jacques Lemaire has a wealth of experience. We had a great relationship from the 2010 Olympics and I’ve asked him to join our staff to help me and the rest of our coaches within the entire organization be the best they can be,” said Toronto Maple Leafs head coach Mike Babcock. As a player, Lemaire spent his entire NHL career with the Montreal Canadiens. He’s a former two-time NHL all-star and one of only six NHL players to have scored two Stanley Cup winning goals. Lemaire was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1984.          "

Theres another fella that was native. This guy was like the wind and could shoot as well. There are many players out there that IMO, make a NHL team in a blink. They just never went that route."

I think that missing the playoffs this year and next is part of the plan.  You don't trade for draft picks so you can turn the team around in one year.

Id rather ship off bernier and keep whats his name for a few years until a proven netminder is available later in the rebuild.  Whoever is in net for the next 3 years doesnt even matter, they are gonna get lit up.  If I was bernier id wanna move anyhow. If he stays on for the rebuild his career is most likely done,or at the very least hes back to being a number two"

But he wild it net, all over the place.  If it takes a goaltender coach to tell him to ""stay on your feet"" then so be it.  IMO he'll be gone in 2 years max"

Use him  When a good goaltender becomes available get him.  In the meantime let Reimer get blasted for 40 games and bring up a newcomer

The team got sold and rogers and bell realized, holy crap if we own 100% of the broadcast rights on a leafs playoff run, cha ching cha ching.  You are a team with literally, unlimited resources, naturally you should be able to throw as much money as required in order to staff your front office and maintaing the best facilities with the best of the best. Finally we are starting to see some movement on this front. They are getting bonafied hockey guys with great reputations and are basically just throwing more money at them than any other franchise could dream of in order to ensure that they win every time. Its not fair, but im not complaining.  Look at Toronto FC..your team absolutely sucks, so you just pay a guy the most money every paid to a player in the MLS, and further to that the most money to any italian soccer player in the entire world....and the funny thing is is that we soak it up like a dry sponge...the stadium is full again and TFC is seeing their investment get paid back very very promptly.  Its all business at the end of the day and logic easily tells you, an above average team in any sport in this city is a friggin gold mine...i.e. see the toronto raptors...straight forward business."

Sorta like in Tampa, you think any player wants to look bad in front of steve yzerman? Ask Stamkos about him over a few beers(hed probably be drinking whey protein) what he thinks of steve and Id bet my life he doesnt say one bad thing, but praises him.  This crew in To is setting their own standard. Play for the Leaf on your jersey or pack your bags.  Strong message. Ill bet 95% off the players respond.

Recently Shanahan got asked a ridiculous question about some ""insider info"" and he outright said, who told you that? and then he outright told the guy to be better at his job and get some new sources ahahha."

The player made the team bad and the team made the player look worse. Those who say they would trade Kessel and Phaneuf for a bag of pucks are just ignorant.

He was a lazy layer who didnt have what it took to lead the leafs to playoff contention, they didn't want the young guys coming up to be looking up to his work ethic. they needed to trade him.  Saying all this, he is a good player who is among the elite in scoring goals over the last 5 years or so...anyone who cant see that is blind and in denial. He can score goals with the best of them.  Also, the package the got was not ""spare parts"" kapanen and harrington both have good potential to be everyday NHL'ers in the next few years."

This was Kessel’s list at the trade deadline and it is believed that it cannot be changed until June 30th.  He would be great on the majority of those teams i think.

922951,grimsbylander,2015-07-02 22:11:00,3016,Hardly a measure of the athleticism required for a 60 minute hockey game. Someone start a speed skating thread.

922955,lookinforwalleye,2015-07-02 23:21:00,4399,Bill and the fact that NOBODY was offering more speaks volumes as too the value of Phil Kessell...my team is desperate for scoring and even they didn`t want him!!!
922956,lookinforwalleye,2015-07-02 23:25:00,4399,I figured there might be a problem with the chemistry when he told his captain to FO when lining up for a faceoff..... ....but that's just me!!!
922957,manitoubass2,2015-07-02 23:28:00,11391,NO! Really he retired????  Frig Marty was up there with Messier and Yzerman IMO.  If he did retire thats a loss for hockey.

Hypothetically if you're a team and are having issues scoring heading into the trade deadline would you not think hey maybe I could pick up kessel and give us a boost to follow through into the post season"
923299,Acountdeleted,2015-07-05 03:28:00,2562,"Kessel was clearly a dump. They didn't get full value for him, they didn't hold out until he was of peak value and they agreed to pay part of his salary. Sadly 'that's so Maple Leafs'"
923526,fish_fishburn,2015-07-06 20:50:00,1311,Id Shanny would of thrown in a skate sharpener and a bag of pucks it would of been a fair trade.
923555,lookinforwalleye,2015-07-06 22:30:00,4399,The Leafs received exactly what Kessel was worth in the open market....a whopping 2 teams were bidding for his services!!!

922858,Acountdeleted,2015-07-02 11:36:00,2562,"Well for every 'leafs fan' that said they just want Kessel and Phaneuf out for a bag of pucks, they got half of their wish. We didn't get Pouliot (pittsburghs best prospect) we got Kapanen who will be the next Luca Caputti and the first pick is lottery protected meaning the best we can hope to draft is another Tyler Biggs (which we added in the deal) this was a bad bad trade.  But hey, at least we got rid of him right?  He'll end up with 50 goals playing with Crosby."
922862,BillM,2015-07-02 13:16:00,17367,"Bad trade, Kessels point production speaks for itself Pittsburg definitely won out on that deal.  Him and Crosby are going to be insane, lol!"
922865,Steve,2015-07-02 13:48:00,2075,"this deal is making me a little worried.  have no worries though.  Kapanen will work out, play awesome, and turn all your opinions around.  You'll see (and I'm not being even remotely sarcastic)."
922868,grimsbylander,2015-07-02 14:30:00,3016,"It really doesn't matter how good Kessel should have been or will be in Pittsburgh. He has a 2-0 record of being a selfish suck that causes resentment on the team. Is it so hard to believe the Toronto traded him for what they got because they had to? Only a well put together team could possibly have the depth to keep him remotely interested enough to play and be strong enough to cover the fact they'll be one man short every time the pucks going in the defensive direction. That leaves a small handful of teams and I'll bet most don't want to roll the dice on existing team chemistry. Personally, I don't wish him good luck. Its a respect issue."
922875,Acountdeleted,2015-07-02 15:38:00,2562,There was no rush to move him. The leafs don't need the money this year the leafs won't be good this year. Let him score 40 goals and be a -27 and when the trade deadline rolls around teams will be begging for him this trade makes no sense.
922878,leaf4,2015-07-02 16:28:00,2466,They should've traded him last year... Then we would be looking forward to McDavid or Eichel.  Since that didn't happen I would've held onto him until the trade deadline when a team like Pittsburgh really needed a push and likely would've given up Pouliot for him. Not a fan of the trade personally but I hope I'm surprised by the guys they got in return and can look back and say it was good
922882,lookinforwalleye,2015-07-02 16:45:00,4399,Apparently Shanny had enough of the selfish out of shape dough boy....last on the ice first off....he wants to establish a new culture.  The fact that there were only 1 or 2 teams interested in Kessell speaks volumes and the fact that the Leafs traded this guy for what they got also speaks volumes!!!
922910,muskymatt,2015-07-02 19:08:00,2608,"Wow, Steve Simmons certaily didn't pull any punches in that article. Me thinks Kessle won't be giving him any interview time going forward lol"

I hope he does good in Pitts (Which I'm sure he will).."
922918,grimsbylander,2015-07-02 19:33:00,3016,I don't think people ignore his point totals Bill  It just very apparent that people who know a lot more than us put heavy stock in work ethic and attitude. I'd rather my team lose because of lack of talent playing at 100% as opposed to what we endured last year. Just my opinion.
922919,davey buoy,2015-07-02 19:36:00,5505,"Just facts and attitude Bill,nothing more.HE had to get out of here.Is ego is way to big for even Toronto.I still can't believe you can't see this.?

922920,Acountdeleted,2015-07-02 19:37:00,2562,"So you prefered our team from 5 years ago with guys who now compete on the amazing race?  I prefer neither. Let's just get this next season over with.  Actually that being said, guys like Kessel drive me nuts. With all that talent, if they had the work ethic of a Gary Roberts or a Joe Newendyk you would see 50 goals and 100 points almost every year.

I'm not sad to see him go, but I think we should have gotten a lot more for a player of his calibre.  Now if we can move the pylon from the blue line, I'll be even happier!"

He is a professional athlete. If your in the NHL, You are NOT OUT OF SHAPE!  Can he improve his conditioning and 2 way play? Absolutely.  Again, I dont like this trade and all leafs fans will be biting their tongues when Kessel scores 50-55 goals and plays on pitts second line"

Some of these guys have so much god given talent and they waste it.  It's not 'he has a round face'.

I'm sad to see him go and wish we had gotten more for him but their is proof in his lack of physical fitness."

922756,kickingfrog,2015-07-01 17:24:00,8333,Out of shape and scores goals with Bozak at centre. Now he'll be out of shape and have either Malkin or Crosby at centre.
922758,manitoubass2,2015-07-01 17:27:00,11391,This just in. Kessel scores 55 goals in pittsburgh next season and we all cry we want him back.  I dont like this move

922786,Sebastian,2015-07-01 20:02:00,208,Sad to see hin go. He will do great in Pittsburgh. It will be tough watching Leaf games this season without Kessel.
922790,bow slayer,2015-07-01 20:24:00,1074,I am surprised TO got so very little for him and had to retain some salary. 40 goal scorers are hard to come by and he did that with Bozak as his centre. With Crosby or Malkin being his centre would not surprise me to see him win the Richard trophy next couple years.I thought they could of got more.
922791,davey buoy,2015-07-01 20:29:00,5505,"He has attitude,everyone knows that.Add he is only a one way player.Sometimes you need all 5 back,just not one outside looking for a pass.People forget so easy."
922806,leaf4,2015-07-01 21:13:00,2466,"Kessel will definitely break the 90 point mark if he's with sid, he plays a selfless game and knows how to pass a puck as well as score so Pittsburgh as a whole will be salivating at that idea till september"
922809,kickingfrog,2015-07-01 21:36:00,8333,"He was miscast.  He doesn't have the personality to deal with the media/fan Bull that comes with being the number 1 guy in the biggest hockey market in the world.  He scores goals. Any lug nut can be coached to check/defend and the league is full of 'em.  His fitness has always been a question, he had mediocre top line help, lousy team support and coaches that couldn't coach for talent and still was one of the top 5 goal scorers over the last 5 seasons. Wonder what will happen now?"
922811,davey buoy,2015-07-01 21:45:00,5505,"What ticked me off,for the last time was him saying,sometimes he feels like playing,other times not.Not exact words ,but his intent was clear."

922823,kickingfrog,2015-07-01 23:05:00,8333,Big dogs? A bought out player and a guy that hasn't been seen for 4 years?
922834,Oggie,2015-07-02 00:24:00,588,He may do fine in Pitts. They tolerate players like Kessel.  My blood pressure dropped the minute I heard the trade. He`s just not my style of player. I think the Leafs did fine on the trade given his record at the end of the season. He`d had enough of the fish borl in Toronto.

922848,leaf4,2015-07-02 03:00:00,2466,"  Also that Steve Simmons article is stupid. He's so anti kessel its as if he never scored a game winning goal or contributed. I remember seeing a stat last year about when Phil scores, leafs win, he had the team on his shoulders much like price does in MTL. Good luck in Pittsburgh and hopefully he can crack 90-100 pts"
922852,Freshtrax,2015-07-02 05:19:00,2215,"Dumb, if your gonna unload him for nothing , at least trade him to the west...he is gonna score 50 Goals with a real center man ."
922853,Old Ironmaker,2015-07-02 06:48:00,8243,I don't follow the game anylonger. I wouldn't know Kessel if he knocked on my front door. I saw him on TSN this morning. Man he is the antithesis of a what a professional athlete should look like. They say that TV puts 10 pounds on you. How about 30.
920773,lookinforwalleye,2015-06-20 01:27:00,4399,Leafs aren't finishing dead last with Babcock as coach.  Maybe if they kept Horachek they would have a chance. Yes but closer to last than to first....baby steps!!!

Isn't that the kind of thinking that has prevented the Leafs from building a great team all these years?  They gave up Tukka Rask, three first round draft choices, two second round draft choices, and a fourth round choice for Andrew Raycroft, Vesa Toskala, and Phil Kessel.  With a little patience, the Leafs could have Rask and six draft choices (Three 1st, Two 2nd, and a 4rth rounder) instead of Kessel.  A proper rebuild takes time; it is going to require a few bad years before they can build a solid team.  It is frustrating that they didn't start back in 2005/06.  Midway through the first season after the lock out it was pretty obvious that the team was not a contender and that a rebuild was required.  If they had started then, we might have had a shot at the cup by now.  But they chose to make short term decisions instead.  It is frustrating that we have to endure a few years of bottom feeding after years of missing the playoffs; but the alternative is another decade or two of teams that struggle to make the playoffs."

Need I remind you the fastest skater competition? You can't do that without being extremely fit. And if you had a clue you might of realised prior to Carlyle getting the boot he was on fire and well on the way to setting career high points, when horachek showed up the collective team laid an egg figuratively."

The egg was laid before Carlyle got the boot that's why he got the boot. Kessel was already heading for the dumpster by that point in the season. The lack of fitness rumour is no secret.  Two teams inquired about him (sportsnet article) and they thought the asking price was too high.  Don't pin this on Horachek!  So what do they do with him if he doesn't pass Babcock's fitness test?
922260,lookinforwalleye,2015-06-29 02:45:00,4399, makes you wonder why the Leafs are trying so hard to dump this super star.....

For the first time in atleast 40 years the Leafs are looking to do a long term rebuild.  Leaf's management even commented about this year's draft choices; they are not drafting players that can move up the NHL quickly.   They were okay with players spending three years in the minors before moving up to the NHL.  They don't need players who can contribute over the next three years; they need players who can contribute in 4, 5, or 6 years from now.  It makes sense to trade Kessel, Phaneaf, Lupol, etc. for younger players or draft choices that will help the team when the 2015 and 2016 draft choices are ready to contribute."

That said, Lehner is still a strong prospect but looks like he'll be gone and Hammond will be kept. We still have a guy coming up who is touted to be a great goalie. Anderson is a #1 goalie no question but Bishop was, in my opinion a better goalie than Lehner. Tough call to make but as you said, it looks like the Sens have many options."

Sit players out, no way , Kissel won't allow it. Trade Kissel....are you kidding, who wants him? He's a ""sniper"" remember? Dion, same thing, who wants him? Trade him for a roll of tape maybe.  We'll see in the first 20 games what impact Babcock really has. You can't turn a mule into a thoroughbred, and the Laffs are just high paid mules. I believe soon as allowed,summer?,you will see some changes.For better?,not sure,but changes are sure to come.A general manager soon would be a good start lol."
916052,Sebastian,2015-05-20 22:48:00,208,"Get the right management(Shanahan, Dubas) with the right coaching staff(Babcock+ more soon) and the right players will come(drafts,trades) and eliminate a negative fan/hater/media base mentality= success.... I.e Blackhawks, Red Wings, Ducks, LA, Montreal, Tampa and soon to be Calgary, Edmonton,  Toronto, Buffalo. No one said 8 stanley cups in his 8 years years. Its a slow process but the right steps have been taken by Shanahan regarding a true build from AHL to NHL level."

Bab's was a good guy, had a good resume with plenty of success and now has been lured into the career ending, black hole of suckdome known as the laffs. Sorry your legacy has been stopped Mike. You were a good man!  Sniff sniff   Naw he hasn't been sucked in but if he or anyone in hockey wants to kill a career Toronto is the premier dung hole of an organization to make that wish come true. He knows that it won't happen here simply because you can't undo 50 years of ineptitude in 8 years but his retirement fund is guaranteed.  The funny part is the hockey illiterate leaf fans believe he is the second coming of Christ himself."

I'd rather they went after guys who can do more than drop their gloves. Toronto needs speed and creative playmakers and passers. The rest will take care of itself and fighting is dying a slow death anyways and none too soon imo"

916061,bow slayer,2015-05-20 23:42:00,1074,"seriously I think Babcock is a good coach but overrated,but the best,no way,one cup in 10 years and that was shortly after he took over an already good team. In the 7 seasons since other than losing to pitt in the final little playoff success. He ranks well behind Sutter and Quennville IMHO and give Barry Trotz the same talent Babcock had in Detroit and Nashville would of won a couple cups. Washington's success this year was from him. Bad choice Mike you have met your Waterloo."

Buffalo gets to pick , 2,21,25,31,43 and 51 in the first two rounds while the Laffs get 4 and 24. That's a lot of good young talent in a year or two for Buffalo. Now Toronto .....well....????  I like Buffalo's chances than Taranta's over the next couple of years to get to the playoffs.  Babcock is good, that's good with 2 o's not one. Good luck Mike, you're gonna need it."

Now that Babcock is in Leaf land I don't see them rebuilding with anything decent.  Dumb move for my Leafs and smart move for the Wings.  Can this Leaf team do better then last year?  Most likely, but can they compete with teams like Chicago or New York.  Hopefully I'm dead wrong."

916004,LostAnotherOne,2015-05-20 19:28:00,956,"Having Babcock as the coach who's probably a top three coach in the NHL isn't going to allow the Leafs to get a top 5 pick in the draft in the coming years.  Babcocks system hopefully can change the teams dynamic, but I really doubt it.  I will be interested to see how this team looks come September"

916006,muddler,2015-05-20 19:39:00,623,Not to worry. Kessel will tell Babcock  what to do. It will be status quo by mid season. Babcock  will be fired by  mid season and Kessel will complain that he's under paid. Welcome to The Laffs Mike. Good Luck!

The rebuild is a strange concept now, however if you are doing it the right way with young guys then no complaints here. There is nothing wrong with taking a very young inexperienced team and building it up.  I along with many of my friends have been discussing this for years, what the heck are the leafs doing, yes there is a salary cap, but there is no cap on how much you can spend on coaches, staff, scouts management all should be top notch.   Anyone else here about guy boucher as an assistant????  July 1st cant come soon enough, dump kessel, trade phaneuf for Edmonton's 16th...ba bam  Shanny is god."

Sit players out, no way , Kissel won't allow it. Trade Kissel....are you kidding, who wants him? He's a ""sniper"" remember? Dion, same thing, who wants him? Trade him for a roll of tape maybe.  We'll see in the first 20 games what impact Babcock really has. You can't turn a mule into a thoroughbred, and the Laffs are just high paid mules.  Now back to real hockey. How about dem BOLTS?"

Babcock, 52, is still under contract with the Red Wings through June 30, but Detroit granted him permission to speak with other teams and will receive a third-round draft pick as compensation if he departs. Babcock was reportedly in Buffalo on Tuesday for a second round of talks. Sabres owner Terry Pegula has deep pockets, but the team is in the midst of a massive rebuilding project and finished with the worst record in the league this season. Toronto may also be considering an overhaul after missing the playoffs for the second straight year despite the presence of talented offensive players like Phil Kessel and James van Riemsdyk. Babcock's teams made the playoffs in each of his 10 seasons with Detroit, and he won the Stanley Cup in 2008. He also guided Canada to Olympic gold in 2010 and 2014.    "

914126,AKRISONER,2015-05-07 12:49:00,5558,"you know how it goes though, you play the right way and the bounces seem to find their way. Just like the leafs 2 years ago, montreal's play isnt sustainable. I remember at the begining of the year when they were on that ridiculous unbeaten streak. I think 17 of the games were won by 1 goal and 10 of them went to overtime.  Everyone knew montreal had major goal scoring problems, and scoring 1 a game like they have been doing the majority of the playoffs isnt going to cut it.  When the team is relying on brendan Ghallager and Brandon Prust to bail them out on the scoring side of things you are probably in trouble.  Also Plekenec has been invisible the entire playoffs, I think his turtle neck is a bit to soft for the style of play. Same old story, toughen up the team up front because they have no presence at all. Montreal plays the speed game, and Tampa is showing that they play the speed game much better. Thats about it."

Isn't it hot enough for you?""The two guys reply, ""Well, you know, we're from Canada, the land of snow and ice and cold. We're just happy for a chance to warm up a little bit, eh?""The devil decides that these two aren't miserable enough and turns up the heat.The next morning he stops in again and there they are, still dressed in parkas, toques and mittens.The devil asks them again, ""It's awfully hot down here, can't you guys feel it?""Again the two guys reply, ""Well, like we told ya yesterday, we're from Canada, the land of snow and ice and cold. We're just happy for a chance to warm up a little bit, eh?""This gets the devil a little steamed up and he decides to fix these two guys. He cranks the heat up as high as it will go. The people are wailing and screaming everywhere. He stops by the room with the two guys from Canada and finds them in light jackets and baseballhats, grilling sausages, burgers, hot dogs and drinking beer. The devil is astonished, ""Everyone down here is in total misery, and you two seem to be enjoying yourselves.""The two Canadians reply, ""Well, ya know, we don't get too much warm weather up there in Timmins, so we've just got to have a cook-out when the weather's THIS friggin nice.""The devil is absolutely furious, he can hardly see straight. Finally he comes up with the answer. The two guys love the heat because they have been cold all their lives. The devil decides to turn all the heat off in hell. The next morning, the temperature is 40 degrees below zero, icicles are hanging everywhere; people are shivering so bad that they are unable to do anything but wail, moan, and gnash their teeth. The devil smiles and heads for the room with the two Canadians. He gets there and finds them back in their parkas, toques, and mittens, but this time they are jumping up and down, cheering, yelling and screaming like someone who has just won the lottery!  The Canadians look at the devil in totally surprise! The devil is dumbfounded, ""I don't understand, when I turned up the heat you're happy! Now it's freezing cold and you're still happy!   What in Hell is up with you two???""   Don't you know that when Hell freezes over, it means the Leafs have won the Stanley Cup."""

I'm sure there are way more better examples but it shows how memorable they were. But these are all goalies that were a flash in the pan. That got hot at just the right time and made a very very impressive run. They played beyond their means and were rewarded for it only to come crashing down and had someone holding the bag. I get the feeling Hammond is going to be the exact same way.  The problem is, you can't not take a chance on him. If you let him go and he becomes a hidden gem like Halak or Dubnyk (though the jury is still out on that one) you'd be kicking yourself. Rough spot for Ottawa to be in for the offseason."

The guy with the broken wrist looked pretty good a couple heavy duty slap shots some nice plays, hits...he is young I guess that helps with the healing process!!!"

911216,AKRISONER,2015-04-20 16:09:00,5558,"that karlson hit is as clean as can be, he hit shoulder to shoulder, the impact was so extreme that the momentum cause the rest of his body to subsequently also collide with karlson.  The refs didnt do the best job in that game, but at the end of it the better team won. We once again see that goaltending is about 60% of the equation. I can tell you Price wouldnt have let that OT winner in and that's the difference maker.  Id be surprised to see either goalies in Ottawa next year.  I think Montreal might actually sweep, Ottawa just isnt big enough to slow Montreal down, its going to take one of the big bruising teams to stop them and the way you will beat montreal is to keep them off the score sheet. I am not sure anyone in the east is capable.  Jesus Montreal should be pretty happy about not having to play Winnipeg or the Ducks, everyone would have broken wrists then."

911019,DRIFTER_016,2015-04-19 20:00:00,10439,Did the leafs get Strome?  Depends on who Arizona picks in the draft on draft day. We know Eichle and McDavid will go to Buffalo and Edmonton. That leaves Hanifin the #3 ranked player and Strome ranked #4. Have to wait & see if Arizona picks Hanifin or not.

910856,TenInchJake,2015-04-18 21:42:00,21,"Nice false equivalency. Patches missed 2 regular season games and a playoff game and was probably actually a game time decision. Stone had a bone bruise described as a 'microfracture' in an effort to get supplemental discipline on Subban and was never in doubt for game 2 despite the crying from Murray. Shot of Cortisone and away he goes. I'm sure you were fine with Eller lying in a pool of his own blood after the headshot from Gryba a couple of years ago though. Just don't slash a wrist, that's inhuman."

910864,Acountdeleted,2015-04-18 22:28:00,2562,It's because Matt doesn't have the leafs to make fun of anymore. Most of his best material isn't useable.

You'll never see that at a Sens game. Anywhoo....there is a proverb about rolling with a certain curly tail barnyard animal and everyone gets dirty so I'll refrain from participating in that.  The series switches to Ottawa now, hopefully the jitters are out of our 6 young rookies and they'll step it up."

910745,DRIFTER_016,2015-04-18 02:07:00,10439,Sens showing their true colours. Folding like a cheap card table!!!!!
910746,leaf4,2015-04-18 02:08:00,2466,Wheres matt? Sens are 0-8 when trailing a series 0-2

910748,lookinforwalleye,2015-04-18 02:10:00,4399,well he got that mediocre team there so I say let him lose 2 more!!!
910749,manitoubass2,2015-04-18 02:17:00,11391,Subbans goal was nasty
910752,leaf4,2015-04-18 02:25:00,2466,This Chicago Nashville game is where its at
910759,bigugli,2015-04-18 02:59:00,6138,"It was a well played game. A third period misplay was the only thing stopping a Habs win, and they quickly fixed that in OT."
910763,DRIFTER_016,2015-04-18 04:21:00,10439,Preds are layin' a beat down on the Hawks!!!!
910784,muskymatt,2015-04-18 12:19:00,2608,"To be totally honest I didn't even watch the game. What the game has become with players like Suban and what they are allowed to get away with has become a complete distraction from the game itself. I was so incensed I found myself in a bad place wishing permanent hurt on not only Suban , but other team members as well. Time to go fishing and calm down. Some comments of some fans have really made me think they take it more seriously than life itself. I joke around but do draw the line at some point."
910790,jbailey,2015-04-18 13:06:00,866,wow
910793,lookinforwalleye,2015-04-18 13:27:00,4399,Double wow....this coming from a guy who cheers on Chris Neil....the Senators are not a bunch of wall flowers Matt and never have been over the years!!!  You have made a lot of ridiculous posts on this thread but this most recent takes the cake!!!!
910795,Craigson,2015-04-18 13:43:00,117,Laser beam!!
910796,Gerritt,2015-04-18 13:50:00,6129,Looks like someone has taken their puck and has gone home.....  Too bad....  Game on!
910797,muskymatt,2015-04-18 13:50:00,2608,"Double wow....this coming from a guy who cheers on Chris Neil....the Senators are not a bunch of wall flowers Matt and never have been over the years!!!  You have made a lot of ridiculous posts on this thread but this most recent takes the cake!!!! This is exactly what I'm referring to.  Chris Neil has never been suspended, and for good reason. He plays to the line but not over it. So of course I would cheer on a guy who is a team player, works hard, sticks up for his star players and yet will not do the likes of which Suban did. Neil had Chara down and out and could have pounded him, but he pulled up. Know your facts! Suban has been suspended for diving, he low brows players entering the zone and uses his stick like a weapon. There is a difference."
910800,Craigson,2015-04-18 14:29:00,117,"It was a chop, get over it. What happened to your precious Hammond? Looked pretty scary on about 1/2 the goals so far."
910805,lookinforwalleye,2015-04-18 15:08:00,4399,Wow Matt....I never thought you were the ubber cry baby that your turning out to be.....can dish it out but not taking it very well.  Chris Neil for the Lady Bing!!!!
910806,bigugli,2015-04-18 15:08:00,6138,"  You obviously have not watched enough hockey. Some of the greatest all time heroes of the game, like Howe to start, or some of the great team eras, like the 70's Bruins and Flyers, made physically dirty hockey an art form. And in playoff hockey, there are no holds barred, and you push and cross the limit every game. That is how a team wins Lord Stanley's cup, and that is the way hockey has always been."
910826,muskymatt,2015-04-18 17:22:00,2608,"OMG, lmao you guys are experts! Yes I can dish it out, and take it. What part of disapproving of a dangerous action on the ice makes me and ubber cry baby ?  Montreal is stepping it up, good for them! Price is on his game, good for him. Personally I had almost no expectations of the Sens, they surpassed that for sure. That said, I can just imagine if the tables were turned. As in Patch got his wrist broken by Karlsson. The freeking qpp would be looking at charges.    Big, if you are trying to justify Subans chop by the style of play 30 years ago or more then I have no comment that would be sensible in such a ridiculous statement. Different era, different rules and different direction!"
910846,TenInchJake,2015-04-18 20:56:00,21,"Matt, Gryba / Eller from 2 years ago is way worse than a little slash on the wrist for a bone bruise. Get over yourself. Climb down from the high horse."
910847,grimsbylander,2015-04-18 20:57:00,3016,"You could see how Stone's broken wrist had him on the bench all night. Lol go the dressing room just long enough to draw the major and, POOF! All better. LMAO"

You can be sure ill be watching the central time games.  The detroit lightning game was kinda meh same goes with the St Louis Minnesota game.  I thought the blues were gonna look better, they are probably gonna go out first round yet again."

Plain and simple.. There is no excuse for a 2 hand slash any time.. Well the dude with the FRACTURED wrist is a game time decision....LOL so much drama.....  On a side note P.A. Parenteau is out with a micro concussion....."
910674,leaf4,2015-04-17 17:42:00,2466,"Not debating whether or not he can play hockey, his antics are not that of someone heralded as the best, things like that are an embarrassment"

With not knowing if your teams players will even be able to play in the games due to the conduct of other players, it's frustrating.

Bergeron suffered torn rib cartilage in Game 4 of the finals, a broken rib on his left side in Game 5 and a separated right shoulder and a punctured left lung in Game 6. The puncture eventually caused the lung to collapse, and Bergeron ended up in the hospital following Game 6, spending three days there.  ..lol microfracture, but all joking aside, not sure what Subban was thinking."

The 4th pick will most likely be Strome..The kid out scored McDavid this year for Erie. Mind you McDavid had 3 weeks off with a broken hand..

If I'm Toronto I try to make a deal with Edmonton to swap picks after the order is determined. If Toronto can make a deal to get Edmontons pick and keep theirs I go for broke with that.

Every team that misses the playoffs participates in the draft.  However, the odds of winning vary from 20% for the last place team to 1% for the best team to miss the playoffs.  So there is a very slight chance that Pittsburg could miss the playoffs and win the lottery; but that pick has been traded to Edmonton.

Sid's best years are behind him and all the injuries he's too fragile to take the risk on if you don't have the proper cast surrounding him, mcdavid has shown he can score and make plays while back checking and has many more years ahead"
909090,BillM,2015-04-09 18:34:00,17367,mcdavid has shown he can score and make plays while back checking and has many more years ahead  ......in junior.    Big difference.
909093,leaf4,2015-04-09 18:48:00,2466,I would still take that potential upside in mcdavid. He's been the best at every level he's played at thus far and many GM's and analysts have stated he has a better hockey IQ on the ice than sid does

Then Pittsburgh approaches you and says 'Crosby for McDavid' 1 for 1. Do you do the trade?  I woundn't.  Crosby alone isn't going to transform the Leafs into a contender.  They will still need a few years to rebuild.  By then Crosby will be on the downside of his career while McDavid will be approaching his peak.  Now, if the 1/100 chance that the 17th place team gets the pick then I would make the trade because he just may take the team deep into the playoffs... assuming that they have the cap space."

Wouldn't hurt anybody and it would make the kids night.  I heard about that before in soccer. Let the kid take an actual shot on net in the game. Why not.

The Leafs will play like crazy in October and November, and probably hold first place at some point before Christmas (when it doesn't really matter). But come the new year, the injuries will begin, play will slump, inexperience will show and once again they will finish the season by watching the playoffs on TV. But they will play well enough in the dying days of the season to ensure they don't even get a decent draft pick. And Leaf fans will all say, wow, did you see how they got it together at the end? Next year, baby, next year!!  Sound familiar? It should, because that's exactly what has happened every year since Ed Belfour was in net. Is that now 10 years and counting?  There - I said it (again). Let the flaming begin.   I stand by my original prediction of September 8, 2014. Now with seven games left, lets see about that draft pick.    And for the 2015-2016 season, I boldly predict the same thing I have predicted every year for the past eight nine or nine 10 seasons.  The Leafs will play like crazy in October and November, and probably hold first place at some point before Christmas (when it doesn't really matter). But come the new year, the injuries will begin, play will slump, inexperience will show and once again they will finish the season by watching the playoffs on TV. But they will play well enough in the dying days of the season to ensure they don't even get a decent draft pick. And Leaf fans will all say, wow, did you see how they got it together at the end? Next year, baby, next year!!   Or, as MuskyMatt  so aptly captured it ... a video from this time last season:    "

They have been in a constant state of flux however and NOBODY was ever given the time or support to get anywhere.  If they are lucky enough to land a quality coach after all the recent nonsense (like Babcock for example though I highly doubt it) the over stuffed management group will need need to take a 5 year dose of a powerful sedatives and let somebody do their job, unload the deadwood and manage the day to day crap with the players as it needs to be done.

They gave it a shot this year and I respect that.  Competing in the NHL is no easy task and at the beginning of this year myself and many of you wasn't sure what was going to happen.  I put them in a spot of competing for a wild card spot and I'm sure you did too.  This was a bumpy road this year for us leaf fans and my only hope is that WE DON'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH THIS AGAIN NEXT YEAR.

Seriously, the Rangers are a dynamite team, least losses in the league, are in first place and are a contender for the big prize. Still 17-3-2 in the last 22 games is still an awesome record. We'll rebound and Boston lost so we (for the time being) still have a playoff spot. Having a stinker of a game was inevitable and I would put 4 of the 5 goals on the defense, not Hammond, who by the way is hurt.

They are doing the opposite of as the Leafs or as you call them Laffs.  Leafs start strong and loose a bunch of people jumping ship. The Sens start weak and pick it up just to fall short of their goal, but what else would you expect from the Nation's capital"

What I'd love to see is all the guys slinging crap in this thread on the ice with him (Or can you guys even skate? lol)  I'm sure your tune would change.

Only two players in the top 20 in points in the league are minus players and only 4 in the top 30.  Jamie Benn is -4, Tyler Seguin is -1, Joe Thornton is -1, Johansen is -11, Zetterberg is -3, Eberle is -17, Spezza is -4 and wait for it...........Kessel is -35.   It is kinda hard to ignore the black and white isn't it?  Of course Phil blames it on bad bounces and empty net goals on Friday....that's some pretty crappy luck."

Phil can skate circles around me and make me look stupid because he has that natural talent. But I'd challenge him to a Marathon any day, give him a year to train and I'd still whip him.

I'm not sure how hard he worked or didn't work to get to the NHL.  Read Brett Hull's book, he didn't work at all to reach the NHL; he did after he made the big show.  The Mechanics stats say it all and yes he won't have a long career in the NHL IMO."

905171,BillM,2015-03-21 19:19:00,17367,"Yeah, Phil was just 'handed' everything he's got... He's never worked hard a day in his life.  Some of you guys need to lay off the crackpipe."
905174,davey buoy,2015-03-21 19:22:00,5505,"Too much attitude now,and he sucks!!Get rid of him and most of the rest.Phil has to go IMO!"
905191,muskymatt,2015-03-21 21:08:00,2608,Any guesses on the score of the game tonight? The laffs always seem to amp it up a bit for the Sens so I'll go with 6-2 Sens. Go Sens Go
905210,Craigson,2015-03-21 21:38:00,117,"Easy does it, the guy did battle cancer."
905225,netminder,2015-03-21 23:22:00,514," As for the sens leafs game tonight I wouldn't count the leafs out already, they always seem to beat Ottawa when the senators could use a win. But who cares, the Habs are playing a good team playing for their playoff lives. Should be far more entertaining."
905235,muddler,2015-03-21 23:53:00,623,"Easy does it, the guy did battle cancer. ""If floater Phil had a heart like Kyle Lowery or Jose Bautista he'd be a Mario Lemieux on steroids.""  So did Mario Lemieux and he didn't mail it in .....ever.  Sens winning 2-0"
905241,DRIFTER_016,2015-03-22 00:36:00,10439,"Sens winning 2-0  UHHHH, you mean 3-3 tie right?"
905243,Acountdeleted,2015-03-22 00:43:00,2562,Hahaha. The Ottawa Chokemasters are at it again. Win every game but the important one and lose to a Toronto Marlies squad. I've never even heard of some of the guys on the leafs roster tonight.
905246,leaf4,2015-03-22 00:49:00,2466,"Interesting, the leafs have been busy signing some free agents Nikita Soshnikov and Casey Bailey. Sounds like they're two skilled guys hopefully they can contribute up in the bigs"
905249,Oggie,2015-03-22 00:59:00,588,"I'm obviously not talking about ""battling"" in his personal life.  His personal life isn't important to me and it's none of my business.  It's the effort on the ice I feel fans can comment on.  Bill when have  you seem him win or even try to win a puck battle.  The American league call-ups are putting a much better effort than the guys on the first line.  I'd sit the first line the rest of the season.  I think the Leafs would too but they're afraid they'd really attract the League's wrath."
905252,leaf4,2015-03-22 01:10:00,2466,Your above statement is contradictory... You don't get to the NHL without working hard

Ok then  ...Not sure why my comment about Kessel wanting out is considered crap but I'll expand on my response to his claim that Kessle is better than Ryan.  I say he is not better than Ryan, or I would pick Ryan over Kessle everytime  Ryan is a goal scorer who plays both end of the ice, he hits, back checks like crazy,is a responsible player and is a team leader. He speaks well to the media and is a likable guy. Kessle is a one trick pony with a good shot,a one way player who doesn't hit or back check, hates the media and is the furthest thing from a team leader one would want.  And I'll stick by my comment that he likely wishes he was anywhere else but Toronto, and I bet, at this point and time, that every player in that dressing room wishes they were elsewhere. After all, who in their right mind would want to play for a team that has the negativity around it like the laffs do right now. For a Canadian team ,I wish they were better, but they seem to have almost like a curse on them. No matter what they do, they fail!  It's a pretty nice story in Ottawa right now and as a fan I'm enjoying following the Hamburglar story. The success of the team right now it awesome,too bad it took them this long to get it going. Next year will be ever better with all the young talent and the new coach.  Happy?"

You may as well flip a coin to decide who wins.  did anyone read the statistics that the AHL was able to reduce the number of games decided by shootout from 15% to 5%....OT winners are so so so much more exciting than a skills comp.

The hotels will snap up the season tickets and boxes as gifts for their high rollers but no one will go. No one goes to Vegas to see hockey."

I have friends in BC and Alaska that fly to Vegas to watch hockey. They are big ECHL fans (Alaska Aces and Victoria Salmon Kings) and go down to watch them play against the Las Vegas Wranglers ECHL team. The turn outs @ the games down there are quite good. Well until this year. The owners of the arena decided they weren't going to renew their lease so the team doesn't have a home. That is being fixed now and they will be back next season."
904666,Headhunter,2015-03-19 15:25:00,5703,So Kadri gets four games and Ovi gets nothing for virtually the same hit. What am I missing? HH

904685,Acountdeleted,2015-03-19 17:04:00,2562,Ovi sells tickets in a medium sized market. They could cover Maple Leaf tickets in anthrax and people would still fight over them.
904695,netminder,2015-03-19 17:28:00,514,"shoot-outs were a novel idea when they first started. But I think the fad has run its course. I think you have have misquoted the numbers above too. I believe it was the NHL decides 2/3 of its extra fun games by shootouts, and the AHL solves 2/3 of their extra time games in OT. 3on 3 is still hockey, and I think it needs to be introduced. I'd be fine with ties too, though. anything to avoid the shootout. Also, the random 3 point games need to go away. Either all games produce three points, or there is no loser point in overtime.  I can't explain the Ovechkin/Kadri thing either, but it probably has something to do with protecting their stars. There'd be no point in going to a game in Washington if Ovechkin wasn't playing."
904758,lookinforwalleye,2015-03-19 21:11:00,4399,Why is it always hockey that wants to dick around with the fundamental rules of a great game....shootout 4 vs 4 now 3 vs 3 crazy....lets make the nets bigger say the size of a soccer net and use 2 goalies and 2 pucks at the same time....or how about one designated player can go where ever he wants on the ice no off side no clearing the zone do what ever you want ( Phil would love that)....anybody else have any stupid ideas to throw out there????  Bring back old time hockey and forget the Bull!!!   Oh and by the way there has always been 2 sets of rules in the NHL when it comes to how certain players are treated...

LAST CENTURY!! Heck, some of the youngsters here weren't even born yet. I for one, will put my allegiance aside and put my support behind any CANADIAN team that can bring The Cup home (even though Stanley lives in Toronto).

Phil is -1 for tonight already and is now officially tied for last place in +/- in the league.  I'm with ya on the old style hockey.  Way too many stupid rules.  Broken sticks? If a $500 stick can't take a beating , tough. Get an old fashion piece of lumber and those could take a beating. Puck over the boards, who cares, most of the time it's accidental. Play hockey.  Now having said all that, I did like the closer blue line in the world championship games. I think the NHL blue line is too far from the net. Just my 2 cents."

904440,manitoubass2,2015-03-18 17:48:00,11391,Vegas will get a team no doubt. Bettman has pushed it for awhile now.  It wont last though
904455,muskymatt,2015-03-18 18:23:00,2608,"the vegas team is pretty much a finalized deal, and its dumb...  a more interesting discussion is who is getting moved?  personally im thinking carolina...but feel free to put up your opinion, personally i wish it was the sens...getting moved to las vegas Yeah, must suck watching one of your rivals consistently do better that you  Of course, that could go for 29 other teams in the league. TSN radio had Arizona ranked worst team in the league, then the laffs, then Buffalo, then Edmonton.   Some teams set the bar, the laffs have it buried 6 feet under lol  Happy laffs elimination day everyone!"

Any of you laffites that are yearning for some good hockey to cheer for.........  18th place is best in the league?  I take it that your day job doesn't require you to work with numbers."
903980,Acountdeleted,2015-03-16 17:42:00,2562,No thanks. I've watched the leafs miss the playoffs by 1 or two points. This is exactly what is going to happen to Ottawa. Have fun with the 20th overall draft pick.
904006,muskymatt,2015-03-16 19:34:00,2608,"Sens have the best record in the league in the last 16 games. That's what I meant and should have included. They have beaten LA, SanJose, Montreal x2, Islanders, Anaheim, and Calgary all top teams. Lost in a shootout to Minnisota and Pittsburgh. The laffs have beaten Buffalo, Florida, Winnipeg and Edmonton in the what?...last 20 games?  Yeah they should have done it sooner and are where they are in the standings because of it. That said, the future looks great with or without a top pick. Look at Edmonton, the top picks sure worked well for them eh? Look at the laffs, they suck and will for a long time to come lol  Seriously though, the Sens have youth, talent, depth, leadership and player commitment, you can't argue that. And for that they will be a good time for a long time. Personally I think they have a slim chance of squeaking into the playoff but we'll have to wait and see.  GO SENS GO"
904013,Acountdeleted,2015-03-16 20:22:00,2562,It's ok. Sens have Ben Bishop...... Errrr Corey Conacher........ Err nope. Wow.  Bet they wish they could have had that one back.

904119,SirCranksalot,2015-03-17 14:07:00,3291,I think CBC needs it to fill in a gap in their comedy programming!!
904139,Oggie,2015-03-17 15:53:00,588,Don't get me wrong Shanahan needs to stay! I'm just wondering if the organization and the fans have the nuts to see this through. It's going to get even uglier before it gets better.  After that Oiler game last night I'll be shocked if the League doesn't take the Leafs to task for mailing-it-in. They aren't that bad despite what Matt says.  BTW Matt your Sens won't make the playoffs and they're just screwing themselves out of a decent draft pick. It's OK the Leafs have done that for years as well.  They finally figured out how the game is played once it's obvious you aren't going to make the playoffs. 
904156,fish_fishburn,2015-03-17 17:11:00,1311,At least the Sens have a little thing called pride. Its about being a professional and showing up for work. If that means nothing to you loser leafs and their fans you get what you deserve.

A real high and mighty attitude they carried around.  What boggles my mind the most about the so called leafs fans, is after they have failed more miserably than their last season, ""its time to do worse, so we can get that draft spot"". My god.  Every year, the same Bull....  The leafs are a joke of a franchise. They should be removed from the league(imo) and replaced by bringing back Quebec. The leafs cant even lose a game properly."

Toronto forward Nazem Kadri will be held out of the Maple Leafs' next two games. Team president Brendan Shanahan says the team is cracking down on issues with the 24-year-old centre. Kadri missed a team meeting Sunday and was made a healthy scratch for Monday's game as a result. Shanahan says that after consulting with general manager Dave Nonis and the coaches, the organization wants to make a bigger point by keeping Kadri out for tonight's game against Buffalo and Friday's game in Calgary. He adds that if things go well, Kadri will be available to play Saturday for the Leafs in Vancouver. Shanahan says it's time for Kadri to start making better decisions, but he did not provide further details. Kadri's teammates seemed caught off guard by the suspension.

902486,LostAnotherOne,2015-03-09 15:28:00,956,"I said it before as much as I don't like Montreal, Carey Price will be lifting the cup up at the end of the season."
902489,BillM,2015-03-09 16:03:00,17367,After 3 rounds of playoffs Montreal isn't going to be able to take it.  Carey isn't going to get them a cup.  It's a war of attrition and they aren't setup to play that game.
902510,LostAnotherOne,2015-03-09 17:10:00,956,"Hope your right Bill, but my gut says Montreal.  What I'm really hoping is a different team wins it this year.  Hate to see LA or Chicago win.  I'm going for any Canadian team that makes it except Montreal.  Like to see Washington win.  Just not too sure if they have the depth to go far."

902519,LostAnotherOne,2015-03-09 17:56:00,956,The good old shootout.  I think the Leafs a few years ago almost made the playoffs if one team lost in there shootout.  I think Islanders or Devils where involved.  Can't remember
902520,Acountdeleted,2015-03-09 18:01:00,2562,You are correct. Devils had to beat the islanders and they didn't start Brodeur.
902522,LostAnotherOne,2015-03-09 18:10:00,956,Didn't start Brodeur.  Now I'm pissed all over again.lol
902539,John Bacon,2015-03-09 19:46:00,3277,The game didn't mean anything to the Devils.  Can't blame them for resting him for the playoffs.  We cannot expect them to start him just to give Toronto a better chance.
902543,LostAnotherOne,2015-03-09 19:55:00,956,"That's true.  I would probably do the same, but Devils will always be in my bad books lol."

With Hammond close by. Remember, this guy is on a high right now, Hammond that is, sooner or later it's going to come back to reality. At this time of year you have to go with the proven guys. All said, riding a winning streak like Hammond has would not be a problem either. Tough call!"

Usually I get, man it must be neat to live so close to the greatest hockey city in the world. I would love to see the Maple Leafs win, that would be great for the many friends I have that still have Maple Leaf bedding, that must be sexy. A few have defaced their bodies with Maple Leaf tattoos. One named his child Domie, I swear to God. The kid can't skate either. As for the troller don't feed he or she. That's what they feed on, reading and rereading what they spew out and rereading what they have caught. Actually I think it's a girl. She has more chins than a Chinese phone book. It's mouth is bigger than the Largemouth it's holding.

Maybe some none play off teams will try get a head start i.e. dallas, but aside from that i dont expect much high profile movement today. these moves will get made in the offseason.

And even if he tells off phaneuf on the ice it was left just there and if they are men and good teammates its forgotten about already"

Watch him go back to being a stud with his new team...lol Of course he will, now that he can scrub the career killing blue and white disease off himself!  "
900419,Steve,2015-02-27 12:09:00,2075,clarkson is pure garbage.  he'll continue to be pure garbage.  he had one decent season prior to going with the Leafs.  Go through his past and show me a second good season he had.  good ridden.
900421,BillM,2015-02-27 12:28:00,17367,"I got so excited once I got that NHL Gamecentre alert on my phone, I think I might have yelled out loud.   Goodbye Clarkson and good riddance to that awful contract!!!!!  Even more excited that the Leafs got Brennan back for Abbott...  Minor league deal, but in a few years I think it's really going to pay off."
900435,AKRISONER,2015-02-27 13:56:00,5558,"This is one of the best deals the leafs have ever made.  They basically got a buy out sent from God.  Dont kid yourself, horton will never play again, he cant even lay down to sleep never mind play nhl caliber hockey."

900441,jimmer,2015-02-27 14:26:00,2730,"Well, I have to say I was quite surprised that they were able to unload Clarkson. Just didn't work out here and hopefully they learn not sign guys long term because they have one good year. Doubt that will happen though."
900461,leaf4,2015-02-27 16:31:00,2466,"Apparently the sens were trying to trade for Clarkson, imagine the comedy that would've ensued shipping our problem there and having to hear about it from matt for the next 5 years!"

900464,glen,2015-02-27 16:43:00,2641,I hope the leafs stop over paying players.  Don't pay big for players that can be replaced by someone on the marlies. Clarkson may do ok if he gets on a good line.  I am sure he can't carry one though.  It's not his fault he tried and he just ain't that good.

900505,solopaddler,2015-02-27 19:31:00,8605,Brennan is interesting lead the baby leafs in scoring a couple years ago then not re-signed....he has a history of not being re-signed wonder why?  I've watched him play - he cannot play defense. He would make Jake Gardiner look like Scott Stevens LOL!

And remember Boston? Even this year?"
900604,John Bacon,2015-02-28 16:09:00,3277,Ummm...My Sens have missed the playoffs 3 times in the last 26 years   I am not sure where you pulling those figures from.  Ottawa has missed the playoffs more than 3 times.
900608,glen,2015-02-28 16:23:00,2641,Leafs have put them out more then three times.
900614,Steve,2015-02-28 16:53:00,2075,actually Komarov was raised and developed in Finland.  He started playing in Russia when he was 16.  my favourite Leaf since Clark.

900369,Raf,2015-02-27 00:21:00,3495,Horton signed a 5MIL 7 Year deal?  I hope he gets better obviously but what are the cap implications if he doesn't
900371,Steve,2015-02-27 00:31:00,2075,"well, he's on long term right now, so no cap hit currently.  if he comes back, than it essentially is a switch - crapson for horton (i mean, how can horton be any worse).  but as long as he's on the long term, his contract isn't on our cap."

900378,solopaddler,2015-02-27 00:56:00,8605,Wow. I thought the only way they'd get rid of Clarkson is by hiring a sniper. I am no longer an aetheist.
900380,leaf4,2015-02-27 01:02:00,2466,WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHOOOOOOOOO
900381,G.mech,2015-02-27 01:05:00,830,It really is a little surreal when your team trades what they consider a 'core player' for a guy who will likely never play hockey again and everyone involved feels like it was a good deal.......only in Leaf Nation.
900382,Steve,2015-02-27 01:06:00,2075,core player? who?  did I miss something?
900383,G.mech,2015-02-27 01:21:00,830,core player? who?  did I miss something?  He was the 4th highest paid player on the team....somebody thought he was important.  Not that it makes any sense.
900384,Sebastian,2015-02-27 01:22:00,208,"Only Nonis thought Clarkson was a ""core player"" hence the stupid contract. Most leaf fans felt like 5.5 million was way too much for a player to replace Komorov when he left."

900388,Oggie,2015-02-27 01:42:00,588,Geez Bozak and Kessel are uping their trade value!  Got a love it!  Just hope the Flyers can come back now.  Reallly don't want to win this thing!

900390,lookinforwalleye,2015-02-27 01:50:00,4399,I seem to recall when Clarkson was signed the TO media was mostly positive and I think there were a few here that were pretty excited as well....see above uber fan^^^^^^^that started this thread....

899956,BillM,2015-02-24 13:40:00,17367," Yup, you're still missing the point but I think it's intentional.  The point was (before all the twisting started) that a top draft pick put into a poor environment (such as Edmonton or Toronto) is not likely to change a franchise.  Crosby absolutely changed the face of the Penguins but he was exceptional and also put into an environment where he could excel (i.e. some solid veteran leaders on the team along with some young talent).  I don't think Toronto is a 'fertile' environment right now.......'nuff said.  It definitely wasn't intentional on my end, but I am in agreement that a star player won't make any impact on a team such as Toronto or Edmonton."

899583,jbailey,2015-02-22 18:19:00,866,i don't have any expectations? like i said.. i wonder how his olympic teammate feels (jokingly..)
899773,jimmer,2015-02-23 15:17:00,2730," The first pick does not necessarily go to the last place team.  There is a lottery to select the fist pick.  Every team that misses the playoffs has a chance to win the lottery.  The last place team has better odds than a team that just misses playoffs; but any team that misses the playoffs does get a chance.  The Leaf's will miss the playoffs, and thus, will have a shot at McDavid.  The worse they do, the better their odds.  Looking at the standings now.  If Buffalo wins 9 of their last 24 and the Leafs win 2 of their last 24, then Leafs will finish behind Buffalo.  So if the Leafs continue at their current pace, then dead last is possible and second last is probable.  I am aware of that. The odds are not in their favour though. When is the last time a team farther down in the standings won the lottery? Their best bet is to finish last and I can't see that happening."
899783,G.mech,2015-02-23 16:49:00,830,"One draft pick, be it 1st, 2nd or 5th is not going to change the world even if it is Conner McDavid.   Take Edmonton for example....they have Hall, Eberle &  Nugent-Hopkins and they are still struggling."

It is a lottery, they don't have to finish last to get the first pick.  Chicago got the first pick after finishing 25th in the league.  The Leaf's are currently 26th but have the worse record in the NHL over the 25 or so games.  If their slump continues they may very well drop even lower in the standings.

That is no different than when the step father picked up his gray's in the 60's. You create some noise, build some hype, add controversy, bring in a few big dollar names, and give the fans a false promise for another year.

Taking a few years to rebuild the team isn't going to change the fact that all seats will be sold for all regular season games.  If they make the playoffs, then they not only sell out the regular season, but the playoff games as well.  The playoff games are far more profitable than regular season games because the charge more and their cost is lower.  So, it is in their financial interest to make the playoffs, and preferably for more than one round."

I'm not missing anything, you saying Crosby was nothing more then a 'nice addition' to the Pens?.  Rookie year he's 6th in scoring with 39 goals and 63 assists, second year he tops the scoring charts with 120 points and also captures the Art Ross (youngest in history if I recall)  So can one person make a difference?  I'm pretty sure Crosby proved that.    Do I think there's one player that's going to help the Leafs like Syd helped the Pens?  No, that's a once in a lifetime deal they got but it sure won't hurt if they pick high in the draft and get some young talent."

The point was (before all the twisting started) that a top draft pick put into a poor environment (such as Edmonton or Toronto) is not likely to change a franchise.  Crosby absolutely changed the face of the Penguins but he was exceptional and also put into an environment where he could excel (i.e. some solid veteran leaders on the team along with some young talent).  I don't think Toronto is a 'fertile' environment right now.......'nuff said."

The Buffalo fans have basically accepted him into their community, so there is no way they would trade that pick unless they want to face the wrath of the fans.  The first pick does not necessarily go to the last place team.  There is a lottery to select the fist pick.  Every team that misses the playoffs has a chance to win the lottery.  The last place team has better odds than a team that just misses playoffs; but any team that misses the playoffs does get a chance.  The Leaf's will miss the playoffs, and thus, will have a shot at McDavid.  The worse they do, the better their odds.  Looking at the standings now.  If Buffalo wins 9 of their last 24 and the Leafs win 2 of their last 24, then Leafs will finish behind Buffalo.  So if the Leafs continue at their current pace, then dead last is possible and second last is probable."

The management would say 'we are doing a rebuild' and trade prospects and draft picks over and over again. The leafs have been in need of a true rebuild since the 05 lockout but have kept paddling the sinking ship further and further out to sea.  I don't care about waiting for a rebuild.

898353,Oggie,2015-02-16 01:59:00,588,I'm sure guys like Kessel and Phaneuf have one way contracts so they can't be sent down to the Marlies unless they agree to it.  I think Phil would agree to nearly anything that gets him out of Toronto but not the Marlies.  Why were the Montreal fans booing Kessel the other night? Does is poor reputation preceed him? Dan O.

Check out today's trade rumours and speculation from around the NHL beat. And follow TradeCentre on TSN and TSN.ca through Deadline Day for all the updates. Phil the Panther? The Florida Panthers are reportedly interested in beleaguered Toronto Maple Leafs forward Phil Kessel with one main stipulation. Florida Sun-Sentinal beat writer Harvey Fialkov tweeted Monday that the Panthers are not willing to part with a ""young stud"" to get him. The Panthers have 10 roster players under the age of 25, including rookie D Aaron Ekblad and former first-round picks F Jonathan Huberdeau, F Nick Bjugstad, F Aleksander Barkov, D Erik Gudbranson and D Dmitry Kulikov. Scout's honour NHL scouts from around the league were out in full force for Sunday's action. Chris Kuc of the Chicago Tribune tweeted that Montreal Canadiens general anager Marc Bergevin was listed on the seating chart for the game between the Chicago Blackhawks and the Pittsburgh Penguins, while Los Angeles Times sports columnist Helene Elliott tweeted a much more robust list of the attendees for Sunday's matchup between the Anaheim Ducks and Washington Capitals. Twelve different NHL clubs, including the Toronto Maple Leafs and two scouts from the Tampa Bay Lightning, were on hand at the Honda Center to watch the Capitals defeat the Ducks. Playing by ear The Tampa Bay Lightning are apparently pretty open minded. Erik Erlendsson of the Tampa Bay Tribune wrote Sunday that the Lightning are reportedly in the market for a defenceman and a top-six forward and will likely be tied to remaining trade bait like D Jeff Petry, D Zbynek Michalek, D Andrej Sekera and D Marek Zidlicky. Erlendsson writes that in Tampa Bay's current salary cap situation it would make the most sense to take on a rental player, however general manager Steve Yzerman can be unpredictable at times."
898443,Sebastian,2015-02-16 17:52:00,208,"I dont understand all the Kessel hate. He is a pure goal scorer. He is not a leader and never will be. People think he is fat and out of shape yet he is one of the fastest players in the league. He is a great player but needs to be put with a true number one center that is a leader. Bozak is not the guy. Phaneuf is a 3-4 D man, not Top 2. Toronto has talent but it was not utilized well. Nonis needs to go. He is the one to give out bad contracts to Phaneuf, lupul, bolland, clarkson. Horrible GM. Bring back Burke and give him time. He seems to do good work. He did draft Kadri and Reilly. Got JVR for schenn. He doesnt seem so bad compared to Nonis."

898296,Steve,2015-02-15 19:57:00,2075,Finns play differently.  Teemu is just one example.  Finns often play strong until they are 40.  He could play as a role model for the youngsters over the next few years.

A third of the old mares need to be sent to the glue works.  If you want to really shake up the slackers start rotating players up from the farm. They've lost the season already, now is the time to see if they have any real talent in the farm network."

898337,John Bacon,2015-02-15 23:45:00,3277,"The last rebuild got them where they are now. Lol.  Yeah, but during their previous rebuild they traded Tuuka Rask for Andrew Raycroft; 1st, 2nd, & 4rth round draft choices for Vesa Toskola; two 1st and one 2nd round choice for Kessel.  Six draft choices and an eventual Vezina winner for two goalies that were not good enough to remain with the team and one controversial forward is not the type of trades that help a team rebuild.  In previous rebuilds the tried to make a quick turn around and mortgage the future for short term gain.  Hopefully they have the patience to take the time to do it right this time.  The fact that they acquired a draft choice in a trade indicates they may actually be serious about a proper rebuild."
898341,Raf,2015-02-16 00:03:00,3495,jokinen's 'less than thrilled' to be joining the leafs.  i can see why but this may be his last chance at resurrecting a career.  he will likely get close to 20 mins a game in toronto in order to 'showcase' him before the deadline and if he can produce (and is not dealt by the deadline) may be a able to drive his relatively low value up given he's a UFA this year.  he was playing 3rd line minutes (if he was playing at all) in nashville.

897458,manitoubass2,2015-02-11 17:37:00,11391,Frig im a leafes/detroit fan but im gonna watch a heck of alot more montreal games here on out.  They are playing wicked hockey
897460,AKRISONER,2015-02-11 17:46:00,5558,nice move for buffalo IMO  Obviously a team looking to build long term while also bringing some exciting hockey to their front line.  an ennis kane line would be pretty nifty if i do say so myself.
897462,LostAnotherOne,2015-02-11 17:51:00,956,As much as I don't like Montreal I wish sometimes the Leafs had a team like that.  I think it all comes down to great goaltending.  Price is one of the best and makes a lot of players look good.  Especially that defenseman they have.

Notice how he handles the media now vrs his first 2 years?  Great talent and a superstar in the making( even though he already is to canadiens fans)  Personally I love the guy
897513,John Bacon,2015-02-11 21:22:00,3277," the jets are getting a 2015 1st from buffalo also, does anyone know if the sabres have more then one first (anohter teasm) or would it be Buffalo's first  I think that was one of about four or five first round picks they have.  I think Buffalo had the NHL record for most draft choices."

897596,DRIFTER_016,2015-02-12 02:25:00,10439,"I bet you will see a lot of changes by next season. They are doing a lot of stuff behind the scenes and it's not all about the players/coaches etc. They have hired Alan Cross to program the music for the games and in November they changed the Leafs home goal music and installed the on ice projection system. Anyone that knows the music scene in Toronto will know of Alan. IMHO he is the most knowledgeable ""new"" music personality in Canada. It's all in order to increase the fan experience as well as to help pump up the crowd during the game. There are way too many other barns that rock way better than the ACC does.  Here's an article on the hiring of Alan Cross and some of the changes being made.  http://www.torontosun.com/2015/02/09/maple-leafs-look-to-inject-life-into-acc-through-music   Report an error TORONTO - The Maple Leafs have come to know too well the parallels between a soulless building and a lifeless team. Now they’re undergoing a musical transfusion, from a press-box control room to almost 20,000 seats. Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment has hired industry personality and “musical scientist” Alan Cross to shake up the game-night experience with the goal of making the Air Canada Centre a positive environment for the team and its loyal, but increasingly entertainment-starved, following. Don’t underestimate what a pulsating beat, fused with a large, loud crowd can do for a team. The Leafs encounter it all the time on the road, in rinks such as the United Center and Bell Centre, the latter enhanced, ironically, when so many “real” Leafs fans show up. The ACC has the numbers in terms of sellout crowds, but not the spirit, due in part to the Leafs facing the prospect of nine of 10 years out of the playoffs, a 48-year Stanley Cup drought and a large corporate season-ticket base that doesn’t excite too easily. Cross thinks he can at least reconnect with fans with the strategic use of tunes. The Winnipeger created the popular feature, The Ongoing History of New Music, which airs on 102.1 The Edge in Toronto and in a dozen other radio stations, as well as run a music website. He and Dave Charles, co-founder of Q-107 and one-time president of the Juno Awards, have formed Major League Mixes Inc., with the Leafs the first of what they hope are many pro sports clients. The twist here will be involving both fans and players in the music-selection process, through new social-media platforms. “It’s designed to freshen things up,” Cross promised on Monday when details of the rollout were provided. “We’ve included a lot of market research in this. We considered (the Leafs have many generations of fans) and it could be a 75-year-old is with his grandson at a game and both will have different tastes of what they think good music is.” Cross and Charles will have a 500-song “core universe” list to play for all occasions and about 1,500 more selections in a library. They’ll draw on everything: Rock, rap, country and whatever is hot, marrying it to the pre-game show, intermissions, commercial breaks, peaking with goals, big saves, fights, penalty kills, alumni appearances and anything else of note between whistles. Cross crossed paths with the Leafs by accident, meeting MLSE chief commercial officer Dave Hopkinson at a wine tasting last year. “The Leafs game was on TV in another room and about five glasses in, we clued in about what the other person did for a living,” Cross laughed. “Six glasses in and it was, ‘Hey, we should do something together!’ He was very into it.” Cross envisions a night in which the crowd might hear Pearl Jam’s Eddie Vedder sing Hard Sun during intermission and, when the puck drops, personalized songs for each player (providing they score a lot more than in January), moving the needle from Bruno Mars to AC/DC to the Tragically Hip to Iron Maiden. Tinkering with the Leafs’ game-night show had already begun in the autumn. Reid Black, senior director of marketing for the Leafs and Marlies, said new club president Brenda Shanahan was pushing for change and the Leafs joined other NHL clubs with an impressive pre-game projection show. It makes the ice a 200-by-80-foot video screen. “It made a dramatic difference, focused on current players and fans,” said Black. “We’re offering much more variety to our fans, such as letting 200 in for free to games (a promotion with Ford) and music is definitely in there.” About 30% to 40% of Cross’ and Charles’ new presentation began a soft launch with the Jan. 29 home game against Arizona, increasing with Tuesday’s match against the Rangers and through the final weeks of the regular season. “Phase 1 is to get music and library right,” said Charles. “Phase 2 is to get the fans more involved.” A website will soon be created to get a music set list for every game and to encourage fan participation. Back in the fall, the change in music included the introduction of Teenage Head’s Let’s Shake when the Leafs scored. Toronto promptly took the NHL lead in home goals and held it until late December, when road defeats led to an overall offensive drought. That led to some of the worst player-fan interaction since the 1980s. “We believe we have the best fans in sports,” said Steve Edgar, manager of game presentation for the Leafs. “They’re loud when the game is good.” [email protected] SOUND BITES Some highlights of the Maple Leafs’ new game-night music plan, to be rolled out between this year and 2015-16: *Fans will be asked to pick their favourite songs and music mixes for Leafs games. They’ll be offered a chance to download favourite music by Leafs players on a team music blog. *New state-of-the-art production equipment and the latest music software, to help deliver and enhance the music production. * The programming will be heard throughout the Air Canada Centre before, between periods and after the game. * Fan music research will be conducted at every game to make sure all genres are considered. * Leafs fan music spotlight will feature the best mix of three hot songs between periods. * Creation of a Leafs Fan Top 50 songs special download, exclusively for the Leafs and MLSE. HOLMSTROM STICKING AROUND “We now present Jimmy Holmstrom at the organ” has become one of ACC announcer Andy Frost’s signature lines during pre-game warmups at the ACC. And Holmstrom will still be there in future, even though the Leafs are investing a lot of money in a new in-house musical direction. Holmstrom, who works out of a press-box booth near the west end near the goal line, has been at the keyboard for years, playing canned music and pressing the air-compressed Leafs goal horn. He goes back three decades to when GM Gord Stellick invited him to work at Maple Leaf Gardens. As a kid, the present-day school teacher watched the ’67 Stanley Cup parade. “Jimmy is an institution here,” said Steve Edgar, manager of game presentation for the Leafs. “I think this new system will help bring him even more recognition. He has been a huge part of this building and the team, and will continue to be.” GREATEST HITS You might still not grasp their Corsi and Fenwick. But almost 20,000 fans are about to find out if Leafs players like the Clash, Coldplay, Foo Fighters or John Fogerty. Player favourites will be part of a new music package to be introduced in coming weeks and months at the ACC. Fans will be able to agree or disagree with their choices for in-house tunes. “They have offered us feedback about our music in the past,” said Steve Edgar, manager of game presentation for the Leafs. “Usually, they want it turned up. They’re on the ground floor, so they know (what they like).” When Dion Phaneuf was made captain in 2010, the famous story was that general manager Brian Burke liked how he took control of minor matters such as the volume of the dressing room iPod dock. Edgar says Phaneuf, the alternate captains and other senior Leafs often mention music they like and that the fans would appreciate hearing in warmups or during a game.   "

897607,irishfield,2015-02-12 04:20:00,26272,"Maybe they'll start playing the music right through the game, so you can watch the dozen or so cheer leaders on a platform... like the Rock lacrosse games.

If the leafs were contenders you could play lullabies and it would be roaring in there."
897652,SirCranksalot,2015-02-12 14:43:00,3291,Brilliant detective work by the Leaf mgmt. Decades of losing and boring hockey and thru some process of deduction they conclude that music is the problem!! We shoulh get that gang working on big probs like world hunger!!!
897653,Acountdeleted,2015-02-12 14:54:00,2562,"Yep. It's far better to come in 9th or 10th in the conference, miss the playoffs and have the 14th draft pick rather then the 3rd or 4th. Leafs proved that for years. Glad Ottawa is playing catch up..... Again."

It was obvious the team wasn't going anywhere then and it was time to start trading for draft picks... not trading draft picks.

896032,lookinforwalleye,2015-02-04 20:15:00,4399,"Dion has to go,Phil,looks like he is arrogant and a downer I think.Get a #1 goalie,we do not have one now that is not burnt out and can steal us a game .Throw Dion and Phil out there,see what we can get.Throw in a couple others.This team needs a 3/4 player change.No heart ,no grit,no nothing.Glad your starting to see this finally Bill  lol..I'm one of there biggest fans,even I have seen this for months going on the downward slide.Nonis goes,Shanny?,who is this mostly quite hardly heard from guy?.To early to tell,thinking he may not even be the answer? I have news for you...remember all those games last year and this year where you were outshot 45-17 and won I call those steals...in hindsight if you would have lost those games you might be looking at a McDavid!!!"
896034,davey buoy,2015-02-04 20:27:00,5505,"I have news for you...remember all those games last year and this year where you were outshot 45-17 and won I call those steals...in hindsight if you would have lost those games you might be looking at a McDavid!!! As mentioned,there burnt out now,maybe not the right term,but that kind of non stop pucks at you is not good.We were lucky to win any of them..That could not go on even as long as it did.You can't have a goalie win every game for you,a steal once in a while is really all you should ask for ?."
896037,jimmer,2015-02-04 20:46:00,2730,I'm a die hard leaf fan   and I thing Babcock would be crazy to leave Detroit. They will give him a decent contract.

896041,jimmer,2015-02-04 20:55:00,2730,"I think other teams are licking their chops when they see the Leafs coming up in the schedule, which just makes it tougher for them to pull one off. Not sure how they are going to rebuild with the cap the way it is. There are no number 1 goalies available, so how do they get one?"
896043,AKRISONER,2015-02-04 21:07:00,5558,"remember a rebuild takes longer than 1 deadline and 1 draft. Expect this to hurt for 4 years for it to actually work. Any sooner and we are back on the same train of attempting to scrape into the playoffs and get crushed in the 1st or second round.  Think about this for a second, if the leafs made the 3rd round of the playoffs at this point, the entire leaf nation would be calling the season a complete success, i heard some interviews out of st louis this year, and they outright werent satisfied and were outright critical of the fact that they were not good enough to win a stanley cup. They considered the season a disappointment because they didnt win the cup. The ownership and management made substantial moves to improve the team even more in order to turn the team into what they believe is a championship contender. Now thats how it should be.  The leafs are sooooo friggin far from being a stanley cup contender, you could blow this team up into oblivion draft mcdavid and next years 1st overall and still be 5 years out from a championship.  Like a good oil change, the longer you let it bleed, the more thoroughly flushed you are on the refill."
896047,tb4me,2015-02-04 21:11:00,3295,I dont expect the leafs to get McDavid at all..But Id gladly take any one of the top 5 picks this draft year..
896049,bow slayer,2015-02-04 21:13:00,1074," All I see are the 3rd and 4th lines doing work, lines 1 and 2 aren't doing anything.  I wouldn't trade Kessel, when him and JVR are on, there isn't a better pair in the league.  Phil has earned his contract.  Now, players like Clarkson?  Dion?  ehhh, I wouldn't be sad to see them go.  Problem is, no one wants them... Teams want the Winniks and Santorellis..  They'll be gone before the trade deadline I think.  As for goalies, I still think we're good on that front, although the decision lastnight to be Bernie back in was stupid.  Reims was out there playing just fine.  We definitely need a rebuild, it's going to be even more painful the next few years I think, lol.  Voracek and Giroux would disagree with you,by far this year best tandem in the league"
896063,Acountdeleted,2015-02-04 22:04:00,2562,"I repeat, I don't want them to replace it. The playoffs are long gone. If the leafs don't score another goal the entire season I'd be happy as a clam. I want a top 5 draft pick."

No more of this, leafs finish 9th, leafs finish 11th. Let's finish bottom 3 for a few years and rebuild. Get some value for Kessel. Now, make the right deal. Get value for him, but blow the whole thing up.  I'll take Chicago for the cup.   I repeat, I don't want them to replace it. The playoffs are long gone.

Tampa n NYI are too inexperienced and will likely fall in the 2nd or 3rd rounds. And Detroit doesnt have a good enough goalie unless Mrazek comes out of nowhere and steals a cup. The West is just waaay too strong with Chicago, LA, St Louis, Anaheim, Nashville."

895973,LostAnotherOne,2015-02-04 17:01:00,956,Your right Bill.  Cant see how any team can take on Kessels and Phaneufs contract.  I'm hoping the leafs don't have to hold on to them until they become UFA.  That's a long time waiting.
895975,AKRISONER,2015-02-04 17:06:00,5558,"They will eat salary if they ship either of them off, but they might do it anyways. Phil isnt the problem though, hate on him all you want but really his role is clearly defined and he plays it. Snipers are snipers, hate on his contract, hate on his style of play cause hes not peter forsberg he plays his role and does it pretty darn well.  Strong statement, but the reality of it all just makes more sense to me then anything else. I personally would love for the NHL to prove me wrong and even more so I would love for edmonton to get that pick (yes im biased) but when i really really think about it all, these leagues, teams etc are all businesses. If you have a clear cut easy business move that you can make to save a franchise that is about to completely fold, you make that move.  The crosby Pittsburgh draft made me a believer."
895979,muddler,2015-02-04 17:11:00,623,"There is NO such position in hockey called ""sniper"". I checked.  A lump of coal is still a lump of coal no matter what you call it.  Phil would do well on a woman's team."
895980,grizzlybri,2015-02-04 17:11:00,565,A team CANNOT drop more than one place in the draft picks.   Actually a team can move up 4 spots by winning the lottery

It's not like the pre salary cap era where you can just get rid of everyone.  Before getting rid of some players I like to see the Leafs wait and see where Babcock goes.  If he stays with Detroit start unloading, but if he comes to Leaf land lets see what he can do.

Has anyone ever seen Phil Kessel cut to the middle of the ice in his whole hockey career.  What a fringe player!  Everyone in the League knows you're a one trick pony Phil!  They don't give you that shot off the wing anymore. Drive the net Phil like you did in the NCAA???!!!

The management got completely caught up with the team that went to 7 with boston and stopped looking for improvements.

The last place team is guaranteed one of the first or second picks in the draft.  A team CANNOT drop more than one place in the draft picks. Buffalo or Edmonton will get either a first or second pick depending which one ends up last.  Toronto's chance's of getting there are slim at best. Right now they have a 7.5% chance or about 1 in 14.

894942,Dan668,2015-01-30 03:13:00,1120,"Lol, tank in full force.  Will we win another game in the season?"
894944,leaf4,2015-01-30 03:20:00,2466,Hopefully not! Bob McKenzie just said our chances to get 1st overall went up to 7.5% with tonights loss!!!
894949,lookinforwalleye,2015-01-30 03:32:00,4399,Bernier is an average NHL goalie and that just won't cut it with a team that can't or won't play defence...allowing 45 shots to a team the calibre of Arizona is pathetic!

895020,AKRISONER,2015-01-30 14:13:00,5558,"lol it is funny that somehow ottawa is still behind toronto in the standings.  I watched the game last night for the first time in about 8 games, and its obvious that you need to blow it up.  Its just so hard to watch guys painfully lose like that to god awful teams. Like the long goal yesterday, that kind of stuff just shows how bad it really is. You can tell they are having a hard time playing hockey and enjoying it at this point. I am sure the millions of dollars makes the blow a bit softer, but at the same time, you are a public figure, and I am sure it hasnt been nice walking around town lately.  At the end of the day, lets hope they dont win another one till next year. McKenzie listed his top 10 prospects and there are some pieces (big centres, big defencemen) that would be great to acquire. Stay away from the hot shot wingers though Shanny!"

I have to give credit where its due..Dion has been playing the last 2 games with a chip on his shoulder..His job is to play D and get under the skin of the other teams players..I would say his play has indeed improved. Any game Dion plays to hit and fight is the Dion i like..Stall brothers had it coming and Dion single handedly put them down like a rabid dog..That looser from Ottawa had it comming big time..He spears a guy in the guts then turtles when the gloves drop..Real classic..Why didn't a single Sen go after Dion during the rest of that game?

894188,DRIFTER_016,2015-01-25 23:47:00,10439,Watching the all star game is like watching the Leafs play the Leafs. Tons of shots and tons of goals all the while there is no defense and a bunch of guys waving their sticks around and not hitting or blocking shots!!!
893532,BillM,2015-01-22 16:24:00,17367,"really you think Reimer let his team down..  He's talking about the first shot of the game lastnight,  you disagree with that?  It was a softy."
893549,lookinforwalleye,2015-01-22 18:19:00,4399,"Not at all It was puzzling how he missed that shot, must be especially tough to stay focused in the midst of this disaster."
893560,misfish,2015-01-22 19:14:00,29133,"After that goal though,he held them in. Bad defense dosent mean bad goal tending.  Since when do you let a forward stand behind you, in front of your goalie? I see this all the time now. Before you would try to shove them out of the way. Do they call that interference now? A good smack on the top of the foot a few times worked for me. Just saying. That hurts like hell.   That Karlson is one hell of a player."
893562,fishsevern,2015-01-22 19:24:00,112,Thankfully the AS break gives us a break from all this.  Time away is good LOL.  Is it possible to get the Leafs game via radio from Lake Nippissing area?  I'll be in an on-ice cabin for 3 days Jan 27-29.
893565,Craigson,2015-01-22 19:46:00,117,I got the Habs/Boston playoff games on a wind up radio in the middle of Algonquin last spring. It was touch n go but in the tent it worked the best. My guess is the tent poles helped. In the past we used a long piece of speaker wire as an antenna n it worked very well.

893573,Oggie,2015-01-22 20:57:00,588,I think the Leafs are trying to tank. Why else would you start Reimer? First goal was soft and the juicy rebound on the second goal was a classic Reimer rebound.  Beirner has the rest of the week off why rest him last night.  They didn't rest Anderson for Ottawa.
893576,manitoubass2,2015-01-22 21:03:00,11391,"Karlson is one heck of a player.  Not often you see a dman with that stride and ability to dictate plays on offense.  Hes streaky too though, but id love em on my team.  Hes not on my team lol and that sucks. But man o man he reminds me of paul and bobby.  That kid has serious upside.  Shame he plays on ottawa. Imagine him on detroit????"

Some may argue Reimer is the better?.I think either is a #1 goalie.They each do shine from time to time. When your facing so many shots on a average night,sure not hard to let a couple easy ones in.Last night being the exception.."

893582,misfish,2015-01-22 22:02:00,29133,"  If you mean, MR. BOBBY ORR,he has a long way to go, to prove that SIR."
893604,xxgoaler,2015-01-23 00:01:00,106,"Bernier hasn't exactly been putting up a brick wall, Hope they put Gardiner down in the minors to get his game back.  He has taken a few steps backwards this year."
893605,misfish,2015-01-23 00:04:00,29133,"Whens the last time the leafs had a marginal paid team? I mean,no multiy big dollar players. Think about it.  When you figure that out,thats when they were a hockey team."

893626,Oggie,2015-01-23 01:38:00,588,Sorry guys but I just have zero confidence in Reimer. I like the guy and I think he got a raw deal after he carried the Leafs in the playoffs two years ago.  He just isn't the goalie Bernier is on a good night. bernier has had a few less than stellar nights lately so I see starting Reimer as reasonable but most nights you won't win with Reimer. Reimer has good stats against Ottawa but he isn't the goalie he was two years ago.
893659,moxie,2015-01-23 12:47:00,1566,Shanny and that numbers whiz kid Dummkopf shouldn't make their desperation and lack of hockey managing skills so obvious.

893789,Acountdeleted,2015-01-24 02:07:00,2562,Phil Kessel just got traded.    From team Foligno to team Towes. For Tyler Seguin and 21 first round draft picks.

893438,DRIFTER_016,2015-01-22 01:14:00,10439,Phanuf not back for the 2nd. I have the feeling he pulled a Connor McDavid and broke his hand in that fight so we won't have to deal with him for most of the rest of the season if we're lucky.
893444,lookinforwalleye,2015-01-22 01:35:00,4399,I have a feeling he pooped his drawers expecting Neil to come knocking on his door!

Youd be a real Munson to trade Kessel.  And I dont believe all the ""he's poisonous in the dressing room"" crap either. Thats all just media spin. So what he doesn't like to talk to media, doesn't make him a bad teammate.  Even when Wilson said hes uncoachable Thats just nonsense.  Even in juniors there is players that are the exception to the rule. Every team has at least one, sometimes many. Happens in every level of hockey.  anyhow. I still say dump gardiner, lupul and Bozak if at all possible And that folks is why the laffs will never win."

893170,muddler,2015-01-20 21:08:00,623,"Ironman Phil. That's easy, just get rid of the puck if anyone comes within 20 feet of you. Watch Phil and that's exactly what he does. You get hurt once in a while when you use your body. It's called ""body checking"". That's part of NHL hockey. Do it Phil. Oppppps, his helmet might fall off and we'd see his thinning hair. The guy is a wimp. A one trick pony. OV at least goes nuts once in a while and slams a couple of people, not 81, he might get hurt.  Boston and LA are 2 of my favourite teams because they play old fashion hockey. They hit,hit and hit some more. Not always cleanly but they hit.It gets contagious, so does the passive attitude. When your leader (LOL) loafs around waiting for the other 4 guys to get bashed around so he can score and get all the praise, it is demoralizing. The opposing teams know that. When 81 is on the ice, the Laffs are short handed in their own end. Watch it on TV. How many times do you see only 4 Laffs on the screen in their own against 5 attacking opposition players? Where's the fifth player (81) loafing between the red and blue line waiting for that magic pass. Aww too bad they scored.  You can't coach heart or speed. I'll take heart and grit over speed anytime. Even if they lost every game and played with guts and heart as ateam, I'd cheer for them too. When have you ever seen fatboy ever check some one other than poke check or a cheap slash on the shins/ankle? When have you ever seen 81 take a hit to make a play? Crosby makes hits (ok, not very hard ones) and takes his share of hits to make plays. Fatboy couldn't carry Crosby's jockstrap. Look at the Olympics. Phil was on fire, Crosby did his job. Who won the gold? Who won nothing? But he was on fire, yeah, right. When Phil the trill figures it out that it is a 100% TEAM GAME  he'll be a real pro player. For now he's a cancerous dead weight that makes 10 million.  No heart! He'll never have it and you can't coach it into him. Prima Donna. Get rid of him. So he scores a million goals, big deal, he'll manage to give up 2 million when he's on the ice."
893176,jimmer,2015-01-20 21:16:00,2730,"I don't think I would attend a Leaf game even if given the tickets for free; even though they are like an addiction (I was shaking my head last night, asking myself why I was watching the game LOL). The leaf jerseys being thrown on the ice is directed at management in my opinion. They put this team together.

893115,Headhunter,2015-01-20 17:26:00,5703,"Sorry Bill, but I gotta disagree with you on Kessel. the trade that brought him here, made by Burke, has put the Leafs in a hole for the last four years and if he stays, that number will grow. I can't help but feel that he is a bad influence in the dressing room and possibly even worse during games. He can't/won't do what if takes to win, is a complete liability anywhere on the leaf's side of the red line and refuses to get involved in any play that requires a spine. He's their ""best player"" and I can't help but think he is a bad influence on the younger players. I wouldn't hesitate to trade him for a number one pick and a proven NHL'er. Either way, this team is not going anywhere as it stands. HH"

They are so soft, don't finish their checks and stand around in their own end when they don't have the puck instead of putting pressure on the puck to get it back. They don't stick up for each other like all good teams do. And they don't play for each other.  If I was celine dion I would be dropping the gloves every game. In four or five games they would be saying he is the only guy doing anything out there. But hes a big coward so that's out of the question. Until the Leafs start making the other teams earn their wins nothing will change. They would be way better off with twenty skaters making under 2 mill a year each that come to work everyday with their lunch buckets and put in an honest days work.

Floating 80ft to the bench for a line change leaving your 4th liners out to dry is not gonna win you many games. And yes that becomes contagious n now Kadri does it too.  A loser will always be a loser if he doesnt give a full effort every shift of every game.  My question is, how do guys like Polak who is playing with half a face not snap when he sees guys like kessel, kadri, etc taking shifts off? If I were Polak Id be Knocking Philly boy out in practice.

I wanna see 4 fights at least tonight lol.  Also, if the d has the puck on the blue line get in front of the darned net. If we even have one guy near the net he stays well out of the shooting lane.

I'd wait until seasons end if I had to.  We need one true center as well, and that's where I eat cost if needed.  Bozak Ashton lupul and Gardiner I'd be looking to offload asap  Nobody will take Phaneuf,  but if I could I'd move him even if I have to eat his contract.  Kessel/JVR/Kadri/Winnick/Nylander  I'd keep them all"

Unless the package included 2 top prospects and a first rounder. and no one is going to give that up.  Phaneuf isnt going anywhere thats a 100% guarantee mark my words.
893089,lookinforwalleye,2015-01-20 15:53:00,4399,Well said HH....as I have said many times even when the leafs were winning it was for the most part smokeand mirrors getting outplayed and outshot sometimes really bad and still winning why because of Bernier standing on his head with a unsustainable save% and some real good luck around the opposition net....ya outshot 40-17 and win 4-1 were a good team...give your head a shake! The captain is a disgrace and a coward...fighting Staal guy has never had a fight in his life. Kessell equally an embarrassment 1 even strengthen goal in 19 games and they made jokes about Inga Hamerstrohm and eggs...he and his buddies JVR and Bozak are the worst +/- players in the league...those 3 could totally destroy a sound defensive team in a week!!!  Both Kessel and phagoof have to go...
893090,BillM,2015-01-20 15:53:00,17367,"Trade Phil Kessel, lol!!!  People are jumping out of the windows when there's no fire...  Let Kessel do his thing..  He's not a defensive player, never has been, never will be.  Changing this team overnight from a rush team to a more defensive minded team doesn't work (These last 5-6 games have proven that).  I'm all for making changes, but that abruptly?  Did anyone really think there would be a change overnight?   They need to play to their advantages.  Rushing, scoring, etc..  So they rely on the goalie, who cares?  I'd rather get peppered with 40+ shots a night and actually make a game out of it compared to scoring 2 goals in like 5 games..  Also, where are all these magical trades coming from?  Thin air?  I'm all for trading the right guys, but if there's nothing on the market, what's the point?  The guys calling for Kessel to be traded need their heads examined."

However, we lived close to my grandparents on my mothers side.  They were Habs fans all the way (French Canadian), and we spent a lot of time over there .... many weekends spent lying on the floor in my grandfather's living room watching the French broadcast of the Habs game.  So - my hockey loyalty is a bit schizophrenic from birth.  It's nice to have a back-up team to root for!  So, yes, it's possible to be BOTH a leafs fan and a Habs fan!!!  My son - 8 years old - has unfortunately inherited this schizophrenia.  For youth hockey, they are allowed to wear any jersey they want for practices.  Last Christmas he asked for a customized Leafs jersey (his name and number on the back) from the NHL shop.  This year he asked for a Habs jersey.  He wears one on Tuesday night practices and the other on Thursday night practices!!"

But come the new year, the injuries will begin, play will slump, inexperience will show and once again they will finish the season by watching the playoffs on TV. But they will play well enough in the dying days of the season to ensure they don't even get a decent draft pick. And Leaf fans will all say, wow, did you see how they got it together at the end? Next year, baby, next year!!  Sound familiar? It should, because that's exactly what has happened every year since Ed Belfour was in net. Is that now 10 years and counting?

I still maintain they once again finish the season by watching the playoffs on TV ... I guess we'll know by April 1.  Predicting this team's fortunes is so easy that even a child could do it.  Firing Carlyle will accomplish nothing. Getting new players will do nothing. The Loafs have been firing coaches and signing new players pretty much continuously since 1967.

As long as Leaf fans continue to blindly support a perpetual loser and keep flooding the owners with money by buying jerseys and hats and stupid car flags and t-shirts and all sorts of other blue-and-white crap, ownership has zero incentive to change a formula that is already bringing in more money than they can possibly count. Blind loyalty by fans has been the basic problem for the past 45 years.  Nothing will ever change until people stop buying all that stuff, stop giving them money, and send a real message that this just isn't good enough.

892367,bigugli,2015-01-15 23:24:00,6138,I'm sure tonight's Habs Sens game will be fun to watch.
892373,BillM,2015-01-16 00:04:00,17367,"2-8-0 in last 10 games and they have scored 1.5 goals per game since Carlyle was fired. They have got the shots against under 25 since the new coach took over, which is good but now they cant score because the big guns are afraid to go to the dirty areas of the ice. We know who they are and so do they.Say good bye to a playoff spot and might as well tank it now.  Lots of points left in the season to be won."

Actually with 2 games in hand and being 3 points behind the laffs, we can leapfrog the laffs in the standings. And with a game against each other on the 21st we could be 3 points ahead of the laffs. The way the laffs are playing reminds me of a Tom Petty song....""Free Fallin""    What's that now, 12 losses in 14 games"

The guy is poison in a dressing room. If you watched the TSN segment on his pingpong addiction and his highy charged interview you know this guy is bad news. Yes he scores 40+ goals a year but he's minus 6 so the opponent scores 46 when he's on the ice!  Remember the Sundin days when the Leafs had leadership in the locker room. Or Gilmour's tenure with the Leafs!  I've never seen the Leafs so hopelessly lead.  Remove the C off of Phaneuf and appoint another Assistant Captain instead. Make up some fluffy excuse.

Detroit will negotiate a good contract for him and he'll stay.  After all what idiot would want to work with those rock heads?  A couple of the sports networks are talking about packaging a couple of Leafs and buying out their contracts are at least carrying part of the cost to get them out. I agree, rip the team apart and rebuild.  Anywhere in the world I have been, money talks....remember there is no salary cap for coaches, and you are talking about one of the wealthiest sports franchises in the entire world.

890870,grimsbylander,2015-01-07 17:15:00,3016,"My opinion... To sit back and say it's the players or it's the management is far to simple. Like any business there is a multitude of critiria which work together to make it successful. Players skill, attitude, leadership, coaching, scouting, Management, etc.  The teams that win are less disfunctional in less areas than teams that don't. We know when the Leafs are on the scale. This is why they are so inconsistent and the win big or lose big streaks happen. Every year there is always one team that ""just needs a goalie"" to be a real contender. They're lucky because all other pieces are somewhat in place. So, my opinion is we're all correct because I can't think of one area of the franchise that is nailed down. Well, other than fan base loyalty and that's disappearing at an alarming rate according to the ""experts"". I personally think the coaching change is warranted, not sure about the timing though. But I also think it's only one step of many that has to get addressed before real, sustainable improvement is possible. Just my two cents."

Look at those games... for the most part they were badly out played in those games and of course badly outshot...if Bernier played over his head 980 save % the Leafs had a chance if Bernier plays at NORMAL level they will lose...  The problems obviously go a lot deeper than the coach....like I said earlier I believe the Leaf defense just maybe the worst in the league...and if Phil the thrill is not scoring he is not doing anything else."
890728,jbailey,2015-01-06 21:21:00,866," That last run they went on proves they can play against the best teams in the league and win.  Yes, they have played and beat some of the top teams.. what I said was I have a hard time seeing them being consistent enough to take down the top teams in a 7 game series.."
890732,manitoubass2,2015-01-06 21:34:00,11391,"Have you watched ""those"" games??? Most of them the leafs outplayed teams, and had high quality scoring chances.  But I will agree I wish they had enough defense/backcheck to lower the shot count game in game out.   Reimers quote is hilarious. There is maybe ten guys in the league that could respectively make that comment(not that they would) and Reimer sure the heck isn't one of them.  Anyhow, I hope they make more changes then just the coach.  And I hope like heck the Babcock rumours are true!?"
890733,davey buoy,2015-01-06 21:34:00,5505,"Get rid of Nonis as well,you guys think there was a line up for Pylon???No way ,Nonis screwed up,should be held accountable.Who would ever extend a contract with more money and NO one wanted him.I hope Shanny is behind the bench next game.A real leader the players have to respect.Trade whatever/whoever IT'S STILL NOT WORKING,two big D,one big proven centre,who will sit in the slot and fight it out.That would be a nice start.This team is going no where IMO."
890735,manitoubass2,2015-01-06 21:37:00,11391,Dougie Gilmour is available?
890736,BillM,2015-01-06 21:37:00,17367,"James Riemer's tweet was priceless "" I think his coaching was just okay .....""  Randy had a core group that was successful in Anaheim, but the Leafs don't have the leadership in the dressing room to make others accountable.  The Leafs have played the same way through a number of coaches, IMO there are deep problems in the dressing room  Anaheim started playing better when Randy left.  I dunno what it is to be honest, I don't think the coach is to blame here.  Although you've gotta have the right coach for the right guys.  I hope Babcock makes an appearance!"
890737,xxgoaler,2015-01-06 21:38:00,106,I to hope those rumours are true
890739,muddler,2015-01-06 21:40:00,623,"Trade Kessel to the lowest ranking team the day before the trade deadline in March for their first round draft pick. Do the same with Kadri and Pheneuf with the second worst record.  it would be a gamble but if they got the first two picks they are guaranteed either McDavid or Eichel(sp?), or maybe both, A three year waiting and training program and with the addition of Nylander and they'd have a real core to build around.  There are quite a few big defencemen available in the draft too.  That would mean that Leafs Nation would have to wait 3-4 years for a contender. I could live with that( even if I don't like the Laffs). It would definitely send a message to any slackers.  That would be a dream team for any coach."
890741,davey buoy,2015-01-06 21:42:00,5505,"I to hope those rumours are true Last interview from what I heard,he did not want to comment on that.Shanny behind the bench(short term obviously) would be so COOL lol.Could you imagine?,I can,he needs to follow through now that management is changing.Could be a great time to be a leafs fan."
890742,BillM,2015-01-06 21:42:00,17367,"No one is going to trade away for McDavid or Eichel, if they did they'd be insane."
890743,manitoubass2,2015-01-06 21:42:00,11391,well Babcock did mention hed love to coach toronto.  Then he dispelled rumors he was close to re-signing with Detroit(for 2.75 mill a season).  If Babcock sign next season with Toronto I hope he takes the scouting staff with him lol
890744,xxgoaler,2015-01-06 21:43:00,106,Anaheim played better when Randy left ? They won the cup.
890745,solopaddler,2015-01-06 21:46:00,8605,Reimers quote is hilarious. There is maybe ten guys in the league that could respectively make that comment(not that they would) and Reimer sure the heck isn't one of them.    Why? That's precisely what Carlisle said about James Reimer recently. The kid has a pretty sharp wit as far as I'm concerned.
890751,manitoubass2,2015-01-06 21:52:00,11391, The other reason it's hilarious is one of the two has a stanley cup! The other is a career back up goaltender.
890752,muskymatt,2015-01-06 21:54:00,2608,"Anaheim played better when Randy left ? They won the cup. There ya go, it's confirmed....the laffs are gonna win the cup this year...

890754,muddler,2015-01-06 21:57:00,623,"No one is going to trade away for McDavid or Eichel, if they did they'd be insane.  That's what they said about Gretsky in Edmonton at one time. You never know what will happen until you start wheeling and dealing. Stranger things have happened. Status Quo for the Laff just won't do it. One quick fix by management has been tried repeatedly by the Laffs. It won't work. I'd have way more respect for a team that tries everything to build a better team rather than the Laffs that continually screw up and sell an inferior product. There are only so many franchise players that come around, gotta go for it when you can.  Toronto fans deserve( I can't believe I'm saying this) a winning team."

TSN keeps talking like it's a done deal. Why would he leave a team that's going places and is ALWAYS in the hunt and in the playoffs? No way. Detroit will negotiate a good contract for him and he'll stay.  After all what idiot would want to work with those rock heads?  A couple of the sports networks are talking about packaging a couple of Leafs and buying out their contracts are at least carrying part of the cost to get them out. I agree, rip the team apart and rebuild."

890627,muddler,2015-01-06 14:16:00,623,"Great finish, very proud of our boys! The last few minutes of the second was starting to look like a typical collapse by the usual occupants of the Air Canada Centre. Very glad they gutted it out. No collapse, just a desperate Russian team fighting for their lives. That was just good coaching by the Russians. Risk everything and you 'might' pull it out. More often than not you'd get spanked for that but every now and then it works.Sweden pulled their goalie with over 3 minutes to go. That the same desperate move. Our boys gutted it out and played head to head against a big strong team and we DESERVED to win. There was never any doubt for me. These boys have true grit. Everyone of these young men was a super star last night. Domi and Nurse poked their heads above the crowd.....Impressive. Canada is proud of our boys.  muddler"

I'd agree if they played like crap all the time, but the problem is they don't.  Look how they play against the top ranked teams, then look at how they play against the low ranked teams, lol!  If the talent wasn't there, they'd play like Ottawa"
890644,solopaddler,2015-01-06 15:05:00,8605,"No collapse, just a desperate Russian team fighting for their lives. Disagree, was some sloppy play by our boys. Moot point anyhow, they won."
890645,Headhunter,2015-01-06 15:08:00,5703,"Talent is one thing and they have some, but desire is totally another. Coach can only coach what he is given, it's up to the players to have the desire to win. Can't say I've seen much desire out of this group for a while. Let's look back to the beginning of the season. Is this team not in the position that most would have been happy with? Are they a playoff team? There's a poison  flowing through the team and it's called ""blue and white disease"".  The best Leaf fans can hope for is the new coach, who ever it is, is given the free hand to kick some butts and not allow ""elite"" players to dictate how the team plays. HH"

HH  I think it's impossible to not blame the coach when the team leads the leaugue is shots against for how many years now? That boils down to system and coaching. I agree with you too though, their core players are deeply flawed. I'd trade them as well while they still have some value."
890647,Oggie,2015-01-06 15:09:00,588,Kessel and Pahneuf the coach-killers.  Can't bench them. Can't demote them.  You're stuck with them and so you pay the price as the coach.  Hope Shanny has enough sense to spill a little more blood. Let's really get into it if we're going to open the ugly box that is the Leafs.  No C on Phaneuf and less minutes; Kessel benched when he can't get the puck out of his own end (he is -6 on the +/- btw); send Gardiner to the AHL to get his head straightened out; etc.  A coach can't coach if the players don't buy into the system the coach is using. There is no TEAM; they play as individuals and that's why it appears to be a poorly coached team.
890651,AKRISONER,2015-01-06 15:22:00,5558,"these guys are NHL caliber hockey players. Facing the most shots against in history is a systematic problem. You can reduce the number of shots a goalie faces purely by changing your style of play.  The leafs still have the best offence in the entire league along with some of the best goaltending. Even if the defence isnt mediocre they instantly have a recipe to be a middle of the pack 7th 8th place playoff team or better.  The team can beat tough teams, the inconstancy wreaks of something fundamentally flawed. Call Phaneuf a bum etc etc, plenty of other teams would love to have him. Maybe he shouldnt be the captain, but hes not a garbage hockey player."
890657,bigugli,2015-01-06 15:39:00,6138,"All the leafs woes begin and end in the front office. Both the current ownership, and Ballard, have ruled the team with a singular perspective. The only thing that matters is profitability. They don't, need to be contenders, need the cup, need to play well, need to pay well. For nearly 50 years the Leafs have been a middle to bottom of the pack team, and they are still one of the most, if not most, profitable franchises in the league. Fans are stupid enough to pay $200+ for a seat at the ACC. Spend $2-300 in merchandising every year. Why does anything at Leaf central need to change.  The fans continue to pay blindly, and the shareholders are happy. And a page from the wisdom of Harold. A little dirt and controversy to keep people talking, is always good for business."

890660,John Bacon,2015-01-06 15:49:00,3277,Playoff games are very profitable; they bring more revenue for less cost than regular season games.  If management is concerned with profitability then they will want the team to make the playoffs and preferably get past the first round.
890662,bigugli,2015-01-06 15:51:00,6138,"  True, but in other years they were one of the cheapest franchises, still filled the seats, and played just as good a game, or better than, the current team. If Leaf central wanted real bang for the buck, they'd give a couple of their darlings a swift slap up the side of the head. Newmarket used to be a great incentive to play better hockey, and it used to be that no player was exempt from that kind of dressing down."
890675,jbailey,2015-01-06 16:51:00,866,"sure they can beat the top teams some nights, but I can't see them maintaining that level of play over a 7 game series.."

Do not think that this organization wouldnt love to play 4 seven game series in a year.  In fact I am sure a Stanley cup final game's revenue in Toronto would possibly be some of the highest grossing sports events of all time. The money involved would be nearly unfathomable.
890691,manitoubass2,2015-01-06 18:00:00,11391,"Well its settled. hire OFC as the new coach of the leafs ???  They wont be hiring long term because Babcock wants in next year, remember???  ?"

890460,manitoubass2,2015-01-05 21:41:00,11391,He looked much better last night for sure! He might have even got a tallie or two if it wasn't for Godla.  Those moves behind the net are pretty slick!
890461,manitoubass2,2015-01-05 21:42:00,11391,sweds and slovacks tied at two. good game so far
890481,tb4me,2015-01-05 23:14:00,3295,Looks like Godla and company just won the bronze medal!  Way to go to the Slovaks..Hats off to you boys!
890482,misfish,2015-01-05 23:16:00,29133,The Sweden team looked like they could care less.
890483,grizzlybri,2015-01-05 23:20:00,565,"TSN just said the Godla isn't drafted, wonder which team is going to scoop him up"

890528,grizzlybri,2015-01-06 01:23:00,565,i walk away to make a sandwich and i missed 2 goals
890529,Old Ironmaker,2015-01-06 01:23:00,8243,2 goals and 1 post hit before a commercial.
890535,tb4me,2015-01-06 01:43:00,3295,Great start..The Russians are brutal..They want to fire us up to take stupid penalties..Its not working..What was that after they scored? Pure stupidity...lol
890537,tb4me,2015-01-06 01:49:00,3295,Wow what D by mcdavid there
890544,Steve,2015-01-06 02:02:00,2075,Russia is playing pure garbage hockey.  I just hope Canada can stay above it and take it to them early in the 2nd.
890545,bigugli,2015-01-06 02:05:00,6138,Intense first period. The first 2 1/2 minutes was   WOWWWWWW!  Typical dirt hockey by the Russians.

890322,manitoubass2,2015-01-05 01:18:00,11391,beauty goal!  great hands great shot!  awesome hit just now too!!!
890331,lookinforwalleye,2015-01-05 01:38:00,4399,"Those are some priceless posts just priceless....  ya bring back Orr,Mclaren and Rosebud...that will help a whole bunch...all you guys did was complain about the fourth line now you want them back...And now you guys are getting tired of Phil the thrill and his figure skating in his own end...hey he is ninth in league scoring that's not bad and they have 2 in the top 20 but alas they are both minus players.  I said it last year and this one as well....when you combine mediocre defense and mediocre goal-tending with no particular defensive system ( I can`t figure out the Leafs system)...you will play more in your end than the other end and you will continually be outshot by a large margin and average/mediocre players when continually put in that situation will fold.  I think I am being generous when I give the Leafs defense credit for being mediocre because they are arguably the worst 6 man unit in the league..."
890333,manitoubass2,2015-01-05 01:47:00,11391,juniors are on.  shhhhh about NHL  watch world juniors and be happy

890368,tb4me,2015-01-05 03:44:00,3295,What a game..How is it that Godla wasnt the player of the game for the Slovaks. What an amazing performance..Fans nailed with some respect for the kid..Go Canada Go!

890252,xxgoaler,2015-01-04 21:42:00,106,Phaneuf is training to be a goal ludge when his contract runs out.  He always has the best view when the opposition scores.

890270,xxgoaler,2015-01-04 22:01:00,106,"That little guy banging his head against the wall looks like Shannahan everytime Dion's on the ice , Davey"
890273,Steve,2015-01-04 22:03:00,2075,"You know, after his contract is up, and if he doesn't retire (which I doubt he will), another team will get him for 1/4 the cost, and he'll be a second line D.  In that role, he'll be fine.  Just not wearing the ""C"" and playing against the opposing teams ""best""."
890277,xxgoaler,2015-01-04 22:09:00,106,"That's where he should be , 2nd line , no "" C "" , no power play and no penalty killing"
890278,Steve,2015-01-04 22:10:00,2075,"Agreed. And some team is going to take advantage of that, and get him for cheap.  We are going to look like fools (what else is new, lol)."
890279,davey buoy,2015-01-04 22:10:00,5505,"All some of us were asking was take the C away.Then we go from there.Not sure his speed would increase,but his defensive play may blossom?.Not sure though..There is still other problems as well let's face it,that might be a good start"

890285,Steve,2015-01-04 22:26:00,2075,"same thing they were thinking when they signed Clarkson?  (to be honest, I personally feel he's worse to the team than Dion is)."
890288,tb4me,2015-01-04 22:30:00,3295,I myself dont agree that Dion is the biggest issue here..In fact far from it..We have no back bone..Komorov was th eonly guy all year that was any sort of back bone.. Now in my opinion he was cleared to soon to play. Im not sure I seen him hit anyone once lastnight...This team is nothing short of a pretty whens pay day type of a team..We need our #1 centre and a tough guy or 2..BTW what happened to the spell check option on this board?
890290,manitoubass2,2015-01-04 22:40:00,11391,"No NHL talk, better hockey is on right now"
890292,LostAnotherOne,2015-01-04 22:41:00,956,It's funny not too long ago they were one of the best teams in the league at the time(gonna get replies for that one).  I think they went 9-1 last month or November.  It was just a matter of time before there luck ran out.  Just say to yourself is this the team to win the cup cause that's all that counts.  If not then what do you do?
890293,LostAnotherOne,2015-01-04 22:43:00,956,Your right manitoubass2.  I was right in the middle of my paragraph when you put that message in lol.
890294,manitoubass2,2015-01-04 22:45:00,11391, Russia looks good up two heading into the third.  The game was very close until about half way through the second.  It sucks for Canada Fabry is out. Hes a skilled kid for sure
890296,Steve,2015-01-04 22:48:00,2075,"I wish this was the Sweden team that Finland played last game.  Swedes are being outplayed, and I can't believe I'm saying this, but outclassed as well."
890298,manitoubass2,2015-01-04 22:52:00,11391,3 zip now. Ouch  Darn I want SWE to win
890299,LostAnotherOne,2015-01-04 22:56:00,956,"I know it early boys, but Canada vs Russia in the finals.  I just remembered that comeback a couple of years ago for the Russians.  I was hurt for a few days after."
890301,manitoubass2,2015-01-04 23:00:00,11391,better knock on some canadian maple?
890306,davey buoy,2015-01-04 23:47:00,5505,better knock on some canadian maple Connor Mcdavid is on the mend as we see each game so far.Watch him shine this game and from here to the next!!!You heard it here first lol.
890312,manitoubass2,2015-01-05 00:37:00,11391,I just heard that on TSN.  J/K  GO CANADA GO!!!  TIC TACK TOA!!!!

889969,LostAnotherOne,2015-01-03 03:32:00,956,Glad to see team Canada win 8-0.  Just rather see it against the States as opposed to Denmark.  Kinda like that team.

890021,Steve,2015-01-03 17:18:00,2075,"I did my best to cheer my boys on, including five individual TV appearances (LOL to TSN, don't put me on camera if you want ratings).  I guess sitting infront of the Swedish section had its advantages.  No amount of cheering helped my boys though.  "
890057,LostAnotherOne,2015-01-03 21:05:00,956,Hey that's you Steve.  Long time no see.  Too bad it wasn't a Canada vs Finland matchup for gold.
890067,Steve,2015-01-03 21:45:00,2075,the tsn guy was trying to egg me on to get the swede section going.....  i told him to buy me two more beers and see what fun could arise.
890107,Oggie,2015-01-04 01:40:00,588,"Geez it's nice to see a team with a KILLER instinct.   Winnipeg know Toronto is tired so what do they do.....finish every check with enthusiasm!  Guys like Kessel, Bozak, Booth, etc., are looking for places to hide under the boards!  Good job by Reimer to keep it from getting embarrassing.....but there's still the third period."
890112,glen,2015-01-04 02:06:00,2641,Must call penalties at random. The leafs are just resting.  Wait till they play better at home.  Carlyle should have got a shirt canon for Xmas. As soon as the game starts fire some leaf shirts on the ice.  Next thing you know they win.
890115,glen,2015-01-04 02:18:00,2641,Refs.   Look up goaltender interference.
890118,lookinforwalleye,2015-01-04 02:44:00,4399,I take it the Leafs lost...and were totally out played and outshot...  Habs beat Pittsburgh to take first in the conference in case you where wondering. ?.Lol
890119,glen,2015-01-04 02:48:00,2641,Go Habs.
890121,grizzlybri,2015-01-04 02:54:00,565,well I hope they play better when I go to the game this Friday when the play the Blue Jackets
890126,Steve,2015-01-04 03:10:00,2075,"well, I'm glad Montreal has the habs...cause they sure don't support any other forms of Canadian hockey."
890132,lookinforwalleye,2015-01-04 03:40:00,4399,LOL....probably more likely that they didn't like being gouged...I understand that things are different in Toronto fans here are used to being gouged.
890172,Oggie,2015-01-04 15:46:00,588,:clapping:A shirt canon for Carlyle now that's a scream!
890174,Oggie,2015-01-04 15:48:00,588,Check out the Thrift shops for an old Leafs sweater!  Just saying.
890222,fish_fishburn,2015-01-04 20:04:00,1311,The wheels have fallen off. This team is so pathetic. The Jets were missing their top 4 dmen and still spanked the leafs. Oh right the leafs were tired cause they were on a road trip. lol. Losers
890224,manitoubass2,2015-01-04 20:24:00,11391,The NHL doesn't count until the Juniors tourny is over.  Two big games today!!!!  Gonna be a great day!  Making some beef/greens/bok choy and some homemade chicken balls for the game tonight. mmmmmm
890230,tb4me,2015-01-04 21:04:00,3295,Go Canada Go!Leafs need to get a tough guy..They way Lucic single handedly beat down Lupes Holland and Naz is just out of hand..No respect or fear..The way The  Buf skated around our zone fealrless all the while JVR bounced off of him sends a strong message..Act now Shanny..This is embarasing..Kessel has become a one trick pony and the gig is up. Im one pied off fan today..Go Canada Go!
890235,LostAnotherOne,2015-01-04 21:16:00,956,Like I said before this is gonna be a rollercoaster year again.  I put it 50/50 on making the playoffs.  Its all up to one guy to get them there and that's Bernier.  Go Canada Go.

Never a fan of Sid the kid, but that has changed. Here,s a guy that has given to the game and taken more hits and injury and still comes back to play the game. That,s a player.

889852,Steve,2015-01-02 16:57:00,2075,just picked up three tickets for the Finland Sweden game.  Jesse Puljujarvi vs William Nylander  Puljujarvi is likely the best 16 year old in the world.
889859,LostAnotherOne,2015-01-02 17:13:00,956,Enjoy yourself Steve.  Don't forget to wear your Aki Berg jersey lol.
889861,Steve,2015-01-02 17:21:00,2075,"I'll kill you!!!! I'm wearing my Finland World Jr's jersey I bought before my last Leafs game.... I was planning on not ""naming"" it on the back...  But after Jesse, and he'll be on the team again next year, I'm going to get it done with his name....  He's playing better than McDavid, and isn't even draft eligible until 2016.  Although he's already touted to be top three, if not, number one (which would be a first ever for a Finn)."
889862,BillM,2015-01-02 17:27:00,17367,Aki Berg!!  LOL!!!!!!!  Now that's funny.

889260,Acountdeleted,2014-12-30 03:06:00,2562,Can we please fire Romanak? Now he's trying to say it's Reimers fault he got run over for sticking his head outside the blue paint.

889262,LostAnotherOne,2014-12-30 03:10:00,956,"Goodbye Carlyle.  It may be early but unfortunately he's gone between now and end of season.  My personal opinion it has nothing to do with the coach, but the team is 100% responsible."
889263,Oggie,2014-12-30 03:13:00,588,Unfortunately you're right.  I can hear the 18 wheeler warming up and the cliff is in sight.  Carlyle is driving the truck!  It's just going to happen in January instead of March so they can change the coach before the end of the season.
889264,glen,2014-12-30 03:15:00,2641,No fighting in hockey it's too dangerous.  But you can have  free shots at Reimers head. Refs win another game.
889266,lookinforwalleye,2014-12-30 03:26:00,4399,if I recall Reimers has been hit at least 4 times in the same fashion as tonite hit...just a suggestion but perhaps he might think about getting his blocker/arm up to protect himself.
889267,glen,2014-12-30 03:42:00,2641,The league should change the rules and give penalties for that. 100 % not Reimers fault.

Go Leafs Go!The Leafs had the best record this year going into the holiday break since the 03-04 season... Sure consistency has been an issue all year, but crying like a bunch of ingrates and crapping all over the team at every loss is shameful and the worst kind of 'fan support'. No one is forcing any of you to be a Leafs fan, there are 29 other teams in the league. Choose one. GO LEAFS GO!Well said IMO"

889162,manitoubass2,2014-12-29 19:46:00,11391,So who picks up Heatley off waivers???

889188,davey buoy,2014-12-29 21:41:00,5505,"In all seriousness,it wasn't that long ago Leafs regularly picked up players on their tail end of the career. Most times dealt in their prime only to come back years later.Things have sure changed that way!!"

889208,Pikeslayer,2014-12-29 23:46:00,1443,"I quit being a leafs fan the day the captain started wearing a RED  BULL cap in post game & media interviews. In my mind, that showed total disdain towards the organization, his teammates and ultimately me as a fan (ex) of the Toronto Maple Leafs. A clear show of disrespect that should have warranted a change in team leadership. When they take the C away and give it to a player who respects the title, I will hopefully be a fan again. It's no big secret that Phaneuf has no leadership values, no respect in the dressing room, and is given due disdain by his teammates accordingly."
889209,lookinforwalleye,2014-12-29 23:47:00,4399, I am guessing nooooobody!!!
889211,lookinforwalleye,2014-12-29 23:53:00,4399,ditto.....that was proven a couple of years ago when the camera caught Kessel  telling the captain to _ _ _ _ _ _ _!!!!
889212,BillM,2014-12-29 23:53:00,17367,"So who picks up Heatley off waivers???  He's played 6 games, no points, no nothing and is a -3..   I don't want him, lol."
889213,lookinforwalleye,2014-12-30 00:04:00,4399,Last 2 years he made 11 million and scored 23 goals....

889217,LostAnotherOne,2014-12-30 00:07:00,956,Ok big game tonight.  I'm wearing my new leafs jersey and hopefully it will bring some luck.
889218,xxgoaler,2014-12-30 00:11:00,106,"the Leafs do not want under achievers, they have been trying to purge those type of players for years"
889226,Oggie,2014-12-30 00:30:00,588,"The Leafs have the nerve to black out the game!  Thank You.  Last nights game reminded me of the collapse against Boston last year in the playoffs.  They still refuse to play Carlyle's system to defend leads and when Reimer is in the nets they don't have the goaltending to trade chances with a good offensive team.  There's no doubt they are a better team and they are close to being a playoff team but they're something missing.  Leadership would be a good start.  Cut Pahneuf back to 15 minutes. Play him on the powerplay. That's it! He's not a top 4 defensemen. He CAN""T F'n skate! He has no balance.  Witness his prowess in a fight. He won't fight because he has no balance!   He toe pics constantly at key times in the game."
889229,manitoubass2,2014-12-30 00:34:00,11391,"someone will grab heatley, it just better not be toronto!  my guess is he goes to boston for half a year"
889101,xxgoaler,2014-12-29 16:35:00,106,2 goals
889102,xxgoaler,2014-12-29 16:38:00,106,"Maybe take the C off him and take some pressure off, Just seems over welming for him in this market and dealing with the press is not easy"

889105,BillM,2014-12-29 16:49:00,17367,"Maybe take the C off him and take some pressure off, Just seems over welming for him in this market and dealing with the press is not easy  They've dropped his minutes quite a bit this year, I think that has helped.   Although if you do take the 'C'  I think he'll want out of Toronto.   Now you've gotta replace him and to line D men are slim pickings right now."
889108,misfish,2014-12-29 16:52:00,29133,"Not wagon jumping Bill LOL  I like what Im hearing. Remove the C. He is not a leader. Even you ole mighty wise one said it yourself. LMAO  As for all the minutes he plays against top lines, well, he,s getting passed by way to much now to be playing that roll."
889109,misfish,2014-12-29 16:53:00,29133,"So he,s only playing cause he,s a captain ? Now that's a joke. You play because you love the game."

LMAO  As for all the minutes he plays against top lines, well, he,s getting passed by way to much now to be playing that roll.  I don't think removing the 'C' is a bad move, but if you do, he's gotta be traded and you'll need someone to fill that role.   No way he'll wanna stick around Toronto if the 'C' is removed, I know I wouldn't..  This was thw worst game he's had in a while, he's actually been playing pretty good this season so far.   Should we talk about Reims and the swiss cheese pads he was wearing lastnight?  He was awful."
889111,xxgoaler,2014-12-29 17:04:00,106,and how many did Dion stand there and do nothing 4 times ?
889112,manitoubass2,2014-12-29 17:05:00,11391,"yeah its easy to say lets trade straight up for #5 on calgary lol.  bill is right, even if a trade were to come up its slim picking right now and remember phanuefs contract lol  i woud like to see the c on komarov but that c is not coming off until phanuef has a flight booked to another city"
889113,BillM,2014-12-29 17:06:00,17367,"and how many did Dion stand there and do nothing 4 times ?  It's one game man, who cares?   If he's doing this night in and night out, then you should start to worry.  but the fact is, he isn't.    His numbers prove that."

I think with each season and the cap increases, his contract won't be such a big deal... Maybe another team will take it on?  Only time will tell.  But as of now, he's playing good in my books I wouldn't change a thing."
889115,xxgoaler,2014-12-29 17:08:00,106,The fact is that he is consistently bad
889116,BillM,2014-12-29 17:11:00,17367,"The fact is that he is consistently bad  This is the best season he's had so far, he's a +8, playing way better hockey.   You sound like the type of guy that will hate on him no matter what he does."
889118,Acountdeleted,2014-12-29 17:17:00,2562,"I agree with Bill. Phaneuf played bad but you can't hang that game on him. I think you can legit hang that one on Reims. He was letting in a lot of point shots where there was no tip or screen. The one through the legs was real real bad. I know it's easy to start up the 'what if' train, but I think we would have had that one if Bernier was healthy."
889119,manitoubass2,2014-12-29 17:18:00,11391,Thats just wrong. Im not sure what your watching???  Ive watched almost every leafs game this year and last night and last weeks philly game were dions only bad game IMO
889120,xxgoaler,2014-12-29 17:21:00,106,"Riemer has been improving with his rebound control and directing the puck to the corners, but last night was not one of them."
889122,xxgoaler,2014-12-29 17:31:00,106,"for Dion's years of experience there is no way he should be making the mistakes that he does. Like bad pinches or bad reads and letting guys skate around you.  If you know your to slow take a different angle, don't do the same thing over and over.  Those are rookie mistakes and even they pay the price and get benched."
889123,manitoubass2,2014-12-29 17:36:00,11391,"Hes not Datsick, hes not perfect.  and what you just posted, lots of that would apply to Reimer as well.  ok so since it seems most want rid of Phaneuf, lets get a list of who would be available"

889132,xxgoaler,2014-12-29 17:58:00,106,"or Korbinion Holzer, he has been solid when up"
889133,manitoubass2,2014-12-29 18:04:00,11391,I like that call. How old is he now 25-26?
889134,Raf,2014-12-29 18:07:00,3495,"Dion's been getting beat around the outside fairly consistently the last few weeks.  I like the guy and think he's an asset but maybe he's playing hurt and should rest up. I did not notice him being beat like that, at least not on such a regular basis, earlier this year."

He is no leader,and I am finding him very lazy.   it blew me away when after his brutal shift,he went to the bench and handed off his gloves for another pair like he was a king.  Brutal give away,s and pass,s and his defence sucks.  Bench him if I was the coach. But then again, we all know what happens. They lose then they blame the coach for benching him. LOL  I say go ahead,but then again,would he really care? He,s being paid outragous amount of dollars to sit and not look bad or get hurt.  I say take the lose in dollars and trade him.   BRUTAL    NOW"

He has a crappy game and guys are calling for him to get traded?   Talk about bandwagon jumpers.

Those minutes he plays are useless,Nonis should of been fired for that extension.It's never changed Bill,winning nights the rest of the team picks it up and you just don't notice Dion with the two pump shuffle lol.No band wagon jumper here,just don't get the logic of resigning him for that amount,even when know one else wanted him??.I'm glad you like him,many just can't see why?."

889084,xxgoaler,2014-12-29 16:08:00,106,"I'm with Davey, that pylon is useless, the commentators are looking for something positive to say about him and all they can come up with is that he is a plus 11. The only reason for this is because the Leafs are the highest scoring team and he just happens to be on the ice.  Not because of his goal scoring prowess or play making abilities.  He should never have been named captain and should never have got a contract like that. Bite the bullet, sit him on the bench and let some kids play."
889085,Acountdeleted,2014-12-29 16:09:00,2562,"I've been a fan of Phaneuf (I'm probably the only one) since he got traded from Calgary but yeeesh last night was a dog of a game.  Saw a lot of guys get around him and he wasn't able to get back fast enough to cover for the odd man rushes. That being said, he is having a much better year. He had a bad game. That's all it is.  Oh, as an aside, my dad and I are ready to kill the commentators and the colour guys. In between the 2nd and the 3rd period last thing Millard says 'as it stands now, Reimer is the winning goalie'.  WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT?  A few minutes into the third Romanak says 'the leafs have never lost when leading in the third' a few seconds later Florida makes it 4-3.  Are these guys trying to give the leafs bad karma?"

You can't sit here and tell me Dion hasn't had one of his best seasons so far.  It just baffles me that you can ignore all his good play then come on here and call for him to be traded when he has a bad game.   I don't understand it.   Also, there's nothing wrong with a little heated hockey talk bud, we gotta do something until Simcoe freezes over!!! LOL!!!!"

There is a lot of stuff I could say about Phaneuf. I agree, the C doesn't wear well on him. I think Komorov would make a great C, or Lupal. Those guys give it their all every game and lead by example.  I also think Phaneuf is getting paid too much in a salary cap era, but what can you do? As much as I didn't like when Brian Burke was GM of the leafs, he had a great line that I always think of when people say 'Trade _______' .

Like you said, I'd guess 1-2 weeks and he'll be back in full force.  I also wouldn't trade Reims, when Bernier gets cold he's the guy I want in net.

889039,Acountdeleted,2014-12-29 01:08:00,2562,That was bruuuutal. The leafs totally deserved that outcome. Their play in their own end was horrendous.

Even more disturbing is the fact the Leafs give up 6 to arguably the worst offensive team in the league!!!

In other news he also got a nugent hopkins CCM stick and it has the most rediculous curve haha  out playing shinny and I took a few shots and now I can understand why he cant hit the net?  It hard to shoot the puck less then 8 feet in the air, even for my 11 year old son haha"

888993,Steve,2014-12-28 19:30:00,2075,would be a smart move.  he's worth something to a team as a starter...  maybe we could get a solid D for him.
888995,manitoubass2,2014-12-28 19:40:00,11391,Id be pretty surprised if we traded Reimer but I wouldnt be opposed to it.  You would think it would be all over the hockey world right now though.  Who needs a streaky backup? Because thats what Riemer is IMO. I like watching him play but I dont think he is a starting goaltender anywhere in the NHL

888063,tb4me,2014-12-22 01:07:00,3295,Sorry make that 2-1
888064,manitoubass2,2014-12-22 01:10:00,11391,are they playing sweden?
888065,tb4me,2014-12-22 01:16:00,3295,ya sweeden.. 3-1 canada now
888067,DRIFTER_016,2014-12-22 01:19:00,10439,They are replaying it at midnight on TSN2 tonight.
888070,manitoubass2,2014-12-22 01:29:00,11391,nice!  thanks guys. lets hope my dish dont crap out  been waiting two weeks for them to show and replace the dish on my new house
888110,muskymatt,2014-12-22 12:38:00,2608,"Hmmmmm.....I wonder why there are no comments on the game last night. I guess you laffites didn't know it was on. So anyways, the laffs played Chicago and lost 4-0 for their third loss in a row I see dark days ahead for the laffs"
888121,lookinforwalleye,2014-12-22 14:47:00,4399,I hear you...as long as Bernier`s save % stays in the 960-970 range you can win doing that but that is pretty tough to do over the long haul and in the playoff`s giving up 40+++ shots a game usually is a recipe for not doing well!!!  Well stating the obvious here... you can`t continually let the opposition dominate the shot clock and the time of possession and like I said if Bernier stands on his head Leafs can win if the save% drops so will the win%....876 save % in the last 3 games!
888161,BillM,2014-12-22 19:37:00,17367,"Hmmmmm.....I wonder why there are no comments on the game last night. I guess you laffites didn't know it was on. So anyways, the laffs played Chicago and lost 4-0 for their third loss in a row I see dark days ahead for the laffs  I completely forgot about the game last night to be honest, lol!    Should I still post the last 10 game for both the Leafs and Sens to make you happy?"
888163,manitoubass2,2014-12-22 20:03:00,11391,I think most hockey fans watched team canada.  and boy they look good!  is domi ever fast!!!

888368,LostAnotherOne,2014-12-24 02:53:00,956,Glad they got the two points.  Not impressed with allowing another 40 plus shots.  They aren't making the playoffs giving up that amount every game or close to it.

887854,DRIFTER_016,2014-12-20 17:10:00,10439,what was dirty about it?  Max was in a vulnerable position. Supposedly the league is trying to stop hits like that. My guess is Shanny would have made him sit a couple of games.
887856,manitoubass2,2014-12-20 17:13:00,11391,he was in a vulnerable position no doubt. watch him put himself in that position 1/4 of a second before the hit.  thats just turning the wrong way. thats on Max  again I hope hes ok but IMO clean hit

887290,BillM,2014-12-17 14:45:00,17367,"I guess Fredrik Andersen showed us all why he is 43 in the league in save %...  Good on the Leafs if they can keep allowing 40 plus shots a game and get less than 30 and still win....didn`t we read this book last year???  There's a big difference between shots on net and scoring chances..  Take all the shots you want from the boards, they aren't going in."

It's not a card thingy, it's the truth.   Scoring chances is the important stat here, not shots on goal.   I think that's been proven don't ya think?"
887308,AKRISONER,2014-12-17 15:27:00,5558,"I would like to point out the fact that yes, they gave up 40 shots to the best team in the NHL. And Yes they have done that a few times, but its still a major improvement over last year.  They played detroit saturday and held them to 27? shots...Yes its still a concern absolutely, but they have definitely improved, and once again ill reiterate, good goal tending and the best offense in the league is nothing to complain about.  Do i think they will win the cup? no...but neither will any other canadian team.  Its like saying that Montreal doesn't rely on Price...Every team has its flaws, some far less than others, but by no means is Montreal perfect either...They stand no chance in the playoffs either until they gain some strength and size, because every time they hit the 2nd and 3rd round they are so beat up they gas out.

The leafs are clearly not strong defensively, but are playing to their strengths. They officially have the best offense in the entire league...and they play a game which uses it.

I'm not saying I don't like Kessel.  I just think he plays too many video games and spends too much hooking up with those high priced hookers in his condo.  I will probably be calling his name out tonight when you scores a hat trick against Anaheim which will be Toronto's big test.  He plays too many video games and is still one of the best wingers in the league.  I don't care what he does at home as long as he produces on the ice.

887028,AKRISONER,2014-12-16 16:54:00,5558,"What the hell is a corsi fenwick...fancy new fishing rod...  :dunno:  Its what hipsters in Toronto use to try explain why the leafs have sucked so bad the past 10 years.  Corsi: the most popular advanced stat in the hockey blogosphere, Corsi is a possession metric developed by former Buffalo Sabres goaltending coach Jim Corsi. At its most basic level, Corsi is the plus/minus amount of shots directed at a net while at even strength-blocked shots, shots high and wide, shots that hit, shots that get tipped, etc. A player who has a positive Corsi has more shots directed towards the opponents net while he is on the ice at even strength then shots directed towards his own net under the same criteria. All 10 players on the ice are used when calculating this metric. For example, if Mark Giordano is +7 in Corsi over the course of the game, that means he & Flames players he was on the ice with at even strength directed 7 more shots towards the opponents net then were directed by the opponents towards the Flames' net. Most of the time we'll stop there, as any score effect bias generally evens out over the course of a season (unless a team really sucks or is really good, but there's that context thing). Basically, score effect means that a team will play differently depending on how far ahead/behind they are in a game-if a team is 3 goals up, they'll sit back and take more shots against then they would if they were 3 goals down. So, to combat score effect, we can break down Corsi into 4 categories: Corsi Ahead (Corsi while the subject's team is leading the game), Corsi Even (Corsi while a game is tied), Corsi Close (Corsi while a game is within 1 goal either way relative to a subject) and Corsi Behind (Corsi while the subject's team is losing the game). With these tools, we can eliminate most scoring bias within the stat. All of the breakdowns have their purpose, but when trying to evaluate a player, the most important breakdown is Corsi Even-a team won't be taking risks and won't be sitting back when a game is tied, they'll be playing as ""normal"" as possible. Fenwick: Named for Battle of Alberta writer Matt Fenwick, Fenwick is almost the exact same as Corsi, but it doesn't count blocked shots-the reason for this is that it is entirely possible that blocking shots is a skill, and not just a series of random events.  It has some merit, the top ranked corsi teams since they have started keeping stats are rightfully, LA and Chicago...but at the same time on an individual level its a great stat to look at, but I can tell you right now Crosby isnt #1 and concensus in the NHL is that crosby is the best player in the NHL.  I am trying to find his actual rank, but i guarantee its not #1"
887030,grimsbylander,2014-12-16 17:00:00,3016,What the hell is a corsi fenwick...fancy new fishing rod...  :dunno:  I like your explanation better.
887032,BillM,2014-12-16 17:02:00,17367,"Hall for Kessel.  If I was the GM of Leafs I would be all over that.  Halls gonna put 50 in one season, but Kessel in Edmonton wont fix things.  They need a star defenseman like a Weber, Doughty, or Keith that can control the game better, but that's a lot easier said then done.  Kessel has 5 straight seasons of 30+ goals or more (not including the shortened season where he got 20), with an all time low of 52 points in a single season in the last 5 (highest being 82) for a kid that's proven nothing?"
887033,Mike Pike,2014-12-16 17:03:00,1332,"I have to laugh.  A couple of years ago, there wasn't a media member out there who wasn't spouting off about the ""Edmonton model"" and how they were brilliant to tank and get first round draft picks and build for the future.  All's I heard was how much better the young Oilers were than the young Leafs and if you could pick either group of young players, the Oiler were the better choice, blah, blah, blah..  I even remember how the media trashed the Leafs for letting such a great Coach like Eakins go to the Oilers and how they let another great one go.  And now those SAME reporters are the ones saying how disfunctional the Oilers organization is and how badly managed they are from top to bottom.  Gotta love the media."
887039,LostAnotherOne,2014-12-16 17:12:00,956,"Good point, but remember Kessels been on a team that's hasn't done as badly as Edmonton.  I always wonder if Burke didn't make that trade with Boston where would Toronto be.  If Kessel wasn't on Toronto were would they be and what picks could have they gotten?"
887041,BillM,2014-12-16 17:18:00,17367,"Good point, but remember Kessels been on a team that's hasn't done as badly as Edmonton.  I always wonder if Burke didn't make that trade with Boston where would Toronto be.  If Kessel wasn't on Toronto were would they be and what picks could have they gotten?  Who went second overall in 2010?  Seguin?  Along with Hamilton in the second round?    I'd love to see the Leafs today with those two players for sure.   But Kessel has done his job as one of the most potent wingers in the NHL.   I wouldn't change a thing."
887045,LostAnotherOne,2014-12-16 17:32:00,956,"Kessel is very consistent I have to say, but if I could pull the plug on that trade with Boston I would bud.  Toronto lost a 2nd overall pick and 9th overall pick.  They had Kessel on that team when they lost those picks.  Imagine if he wasn't it would of been my guess 1st overall pick and another maybe the same.  Kessel put 30 plus goals in the net for Toronto when they lost those picks which I'm helped them get some wins.  I just think that trade really screwed them up for the next maybe 10 plus years to have a chance to be a dynamite team like Chicago or LA."

A dynamite team with Seguin and Hamilton instead of Kessel?   lol  No thanks.    Not to even mention the chemistry that Bozak, JVR, Kessel line has had."
887052,manitoubass2,2014-12-16 17:55:00,11391,nope. Kessel was the best option like billm said  seguin would be a mediocre second liner on the current leafs roster  no doubt the kid has skills but he needs a team around him and I dont think for one second he fits the toronto mold.  kessel is short term inconsistant but long term consistant.  thats abit of of an oxymoron but its true  the main thing is he shows up and performs.  anyhow. i take kessel on the leafs over seguin any day
887054,AKRISONER,2014-12-16 18:03:00,5558,"dont forget the Blue and White syndrome.  Kessel is a proven performer in Toronto, an absolute rarity. So much extremely high level talent has come through this city and time and time again they have proven to be a complete dud. There is something to be said for a guy to actually perform at the top of his game while playing in Toronto.  Its a known fact that Seguin has a coke *cough* partying problem. You think Boston actually wanted to get rid of him for peanuts? They had to. Hence they shipped him off to a place where he no longer has any friends, and no one gives a damn about who he is and sure enough his game comes around. You actually think that he wouldnt have the same problems he did in Boston playing in Toronto? Ha!  and if you actually think that Dougie hamilton and Seguin would make this team better than it currently is you are clowning yourself.  Kudos to Kessel to silencing the disbelievers and haters and literally not giving 1 single F going about his business putting up close to 40 a season every season without fail.  I'll also throw in that Taylor Hall likes to ""party"" as well...my best friend was a bartender through college and taylor hall numerous times guest bartended with my friend...the spotlights are a bit too bright in Toronto."
887055,LostAnotherOne,2014-12-16 18:04:00,956,I was saying leafs would of gotten more then Seguin and Hamilton if that trade didn't go through.  I would take those two over Kessel any day just to say.  I'm not saying I don't like Kessel.  I just think he plays too many video games and spends too much hooking up with those high priced hookers in his condo.  I will probably be calling his name out tonight when you scores a hat trick against Anaheim which will be Toronto's big test.
886681,davey buoy,2014-12-15 01:08:00,5505,"I'm not getting my hopes up but, man is it ever fun to watch this team. Same hear,just enjoying the ride however long it lasts!!!!"
886689,manitoubass2,2014-12-15 01:34:00,11391,a win is a win lol  that was a good game of hockey.  refs were brutal but thats how she rolls sometimes
886695,glen,2014-12-15 02:01:00,2641,Dan668. Your right. He will never be any good.  It took the refs a while to figure out who was going to win.
886705,LostAnotherOne,2014-12-15 03:03:00,956,Am I dreaming or are the Leafs the best team in the league the last 10 games.  Maybe that whopping Nashville gave them was a blessing in disguise.
886708,Cookslav,2014-12-15 03:25:00,1457,"They look good right now.... I have no idea what changed, but hey...lets enjoy it while it lasts"
886710,glen,2014-12-15 03:39:00,2641,They got shamed by the crowd to play better.  Aka shirts and junk on the ice.
886725,davey buoy,2014-12-15 08:43:00,5505,James played well!!!! 
886732,BillM,2014-12-15 12:29:00,17367,Reims definitely picked it up after letting in those 2 softies.   Quick was the only reason the game was close.   He stoned Bozak 4-5 times lastnight?
886739,jbailey,2014-12-15 13:23:00,866,"lots of road games coming up, played first 20/30 or something at home"
886747,AKRISONER,2014-12-15 13:54:00,5558,keep on rollin....  wheres nottawa? ahahaha
886750,Mike Pike,2014-12-15 13:58:00,1332,"Ya, me thinks that, to a man, they realized the only way out of their little ""non-salute"" to the fans episode was going to be with their play.  And the boyz have been playing well."
886755,manitoubass2,2014-12-15 14:16:00,11391,haha you could sense his frustration. 5 shots on net is a good night but Bozack had 5 shots that shoulda all been goals.  Quick is something else in net.
886793,BillM,2014-12-15 17:40:00,17367,"Eakins just fired from Edmonton.  Not really surprised, although I wouldn't want to be the next coach of that team."
886797,AKRISONER,2014-12-15 18:04:00,5558,I think Eakins kinda got dealt a crappy hand. I personally think he is better than edmonton showed. But that org is in trouble. Nothing Connor Mcdavid wont fix though.
886799,manitoubass2,2014-12-15 18:16:00,11391,conner mcdavid is not fixing edmonton...  eakens will pick up work quick. hes probably breathing a sigh of relief now hes been terminated
886809,jimmer,2014-12-15 18:52:00,2730,Gardiner just has to remember that he's playing in the big leagues. It looks like he thinks he is still in junior or at college when he makes some of the mistakes. Leafs are 2 points out of first!
886811,BillM,2014-12-15 19:07:00,17367,"Eberle hasn't fixed Edmonton, Hall hasn't either.  McDavid won't stand a chance, lol."
886814,jbailey,2014-12-15 19:14:00,866,"Eberle hasn't fixed Edmonton, Hall hasn't either.  McDavid won't stand a chance, lol. agreed"
886835,jimmer,2014-12-15 20:53:00,2730,"So true BillM. I hate when these great prospects get buried on crappy teams; what a waste. Sure you see some success once in awhile, on teams such as the Penguins and Hawks. The Oilers built their team wrong and will have to trade some of their stock to get some all round players to compliment the skilled guys. That being said, they will probably turn it around tomorrow."
886841,tb4me,2014-12-15 21:16:00,3295,Edmonton sucking doesnt mean they will get the first over all pick..There is a lottery.. Dallas has 2.5 years remaining on his contract..1.8 mill per season..thats a tad over 4 mill for the next 2 years no matter what he ends up doing..I think he wants to come back to toronto and they are indeed interested..Come home Dallas..
886845,LostAnotherOne,2014-12-15 21:47:00,956,"I got to feel sorry for Edmonton.  They should be doing a lot better then they are.  Management I think still has time to make a trade and help out these young guys, but they have made it loud and clear there tops guys are off the table.  Maybe a trade with Toronto would be nice"
886870,BillM,2014-12-15 23:25:00,17367,.  Maybe a trade with Toronto would be nice  Lets hope not.

886883,BillM,2014-12-16 00:35:00,17367,  Move them to Woodbridge. BillM for coach.  You wanna be my assistant?!??!  LOL!!!  There would be a lot of busted sticks

I think that's the biggest change.  If the first line isn't on, you can count on a few from the 2nd and 3rd.  That's why they've won a few games they could have easily lost.."

886644,SuperDave,2014-12-14 23:54:00,204,should be a good 3rd.
886647,Dan668,2014-12-14 23:59:00,1120,Gardiner is actually garbage.
886648,BillM,2014-12-15 00:01:00,17367,Gardiner is actually garbage.  You should go out and show him how it's done.
886649,Dan668,2014-12-15 00:02:00,1120,I wish i could.  Awful year for him. Hed probably clear waivers at this point.
886650,manitoubass2,2014-12-15 00:06:00,11391,absolutely!  frig they dropped the lead. lets finish strong boys!

886654,Dan668,2014-12-15 00:13:00,1120,-10. Worst on the leafs.  Weakest on d. At this point no way is he worth his contact.
886656,BillM,2014-12-15 00:21:00,17367,-10. Worst on the leafs. Weakest on d. At this point no way is he worth his contact.  I think we'll agree to disagree
886657,manitoubass2,2014-12-15 00:22:00,11391,as a Leafs fan I dont have many issues with Gardiner.  sure he gives up the puck here and there but he plays hard and is getting better in his positioning.  the kid has a bright career ahead of him.  wait until the leafs are abit stronger on defense Gardiner will wreak all kinds of havok on teams when he jumps in
886661,BillM,2014-12-15 00:27:00,17367,"Man, these refs are missing a lot of calls tonight.  I can't believe they called that one!"

The Leafs played 3 games in 4 nights leading up to it, frankly I'm surprised they weren't outshot even worse.  They hung around like week old thanksgiving leftovers last night and managed to pull off a miracle. Thank you Reimer, we'll take it.  The real test will be Saturday night, looking forward to that one."

I guess he didn't take the University route to get to the NHL. If he had of referred to Rugby instead he would have been good to go."

I see the Habs are falling back down to earth where they should have been all along..Go Leafs Go!

885609,Acountdeleted,2014-12-09 14:00:00,2562,"So, a serious question for Sens fans, my dad and I always like talking about 'If you were the GM would you.....'  Lets say you are the GM of Ottawa and the Oilers come to you and say 'Scrivens and any ONE player on our roster for Anderson and Cowen'. Do you make the deal?  What if Edmonton comes to you and says 'No-Goal-Apov (Yakapov) and Edmontons first round pick in 2015 for Anderson and Cowan.' Do you make that deal?"
885610,BillM,2014-12-09 14:03:00,17367,"If I was Ottawa I'd definitely do deal #2, considering that pick will most likely be McDavid with the way Edmonton is rolling this year."
885613,jimmer,2014-12-09 14:19:00,2730,"Edmonton is done, no need for them to make trades at this point. You usually don't see two bottom feeders making deals with each other."
885615,Acountdeleted,2014-12-09 14:24:00,2562,"Very true. But what I have noticed is that Edmonton has no defensive or responsible play. The kids stream down the ice, don't score and then dog it back. McDavid is going to be great but another gifted young scorer on that team is the last thing they need. They need to make a big, drastic move or they are going to continue to be terrible.  You can win with bad forwards but you can't win with consistantly bad D and goaltending."
885616,manitoubass2,2014-12-09 14:24:00,11391,deal #2 is a no brainer IMO

884755,SirCranksalot,2014-12-04 21:17:00,3291,"The diff between the Leafs and the Canadiens! From today's Star “(Montreal’s ownership) always showed respect for the key guys,” said Dick Duff, 78.Duff would know. He played on two Stanley Cup-winning teams in Toronto before he found his way to Montreal, where he shared a line with Béliveau in the midst of a championship-soaked run that saw Duff win four more rings.“(Montreal) always did it right. So the (players) go there and say, ‘This team respects me. And if nothing else, if we didn’t get all the cash in the world, we got respect,’” said Duff. “And here (in Toronto) they ignored that. I don’t want to be too (negative). But ... there were all kinds of guys who won (multiple) Cups in Toronto. There are all kinds of people in Toronto who don’t know who Harry Watson was, Sid Smith, Howie Meeker, Jimmy Thompson, Turk Broda — they won (multiple) Cups, for crying out loud.”Current ownership, it should be said, has done an admirable enough job trying to change that. But the course was hard to correct. Duff pointed to Ted Kennedy, recently immortalized with a bronze statue on Toronto’s new Legends Row, who died in 2009 to modest attention, even though he was a team captain during the franchise’s dynasty of the 1940s and 1950s. Kennedy was known as a classy man, a charitable person, a team leader and an all-time great. His funeral in Port Colborne wasn’t a grand thing for the multitudes.“I remember when Teeder Kennedy died -— I think (the Leafs) sent one or two guys (to the funeral),” said Bob Nevin, who played on two of Toronto’s Cup-winning teams of the 1960s. “They just sort of passed it off.

884421,BillM,2014-12-03 02:58:00,17367,Did Kessel get that goal or did they give it to JVR?  Pretty sure they gave it to Kessel.
884423,LostAnotherOne,2014-12-03 03:04:00,956,Hope so.  We can't have Kessel go too many games without a goal or Carlyle will take his vids away lol.
884429,manitoubass2,2014-12-03 03:25:00,11391,kessel got it
882730,jbailey,2014-11-24 15:21:00,866,"If you start the pushing and shoving, shouldn't you also be expecting a punch in the mouth? lol! for sure, then he threw his glove at Prout during his tempertantrum"
882735,BillM,2014-11-24 16:01:00,17367,"Pat Quinn, one of my fav Leafs coaches just passed away today.  RIP"
882742,AKRISONER,2014-11-24 16:33:00,5558,"Rest in Peace Pat Quinn  holy crap!     and that Lucic thing ahaha what a rat...he calls prout gutless, yet hes the guy that sucker punched him in the back of the head...he tried the old, oh ill keep my gloves on and it will stop him from woopin him. That is the old time justice that everyone wants to see not be taken away in hockey. Otherwise rats like Lucic will run amok.  I bet he wont try that garbage again."

882880,tb4me,2014-11-25 02:24:00,3295,Man...That sucks about Pat Quinn.. RIP my man..
882895,LostAnotherOne,2014-11-25 03:02:00,956,Lets win the cup this year for Pat Quinn.
882990,Joeytier,2014-11-25 16:56:00,3990,^^LOL!!!!!
883033,Oggie,2014-11-25 19:50:00,588,Yeah Lucic should have expected something from Prout. Chara wasn't around to provide the support for Lucic (guess he forgot). Well the proof is in the pudding when they meet again on the ice later this year. I'll bet Prout expects a fight.
883034,Oggie,2014-11-25 19:53:00,588,I forgot how successful Pat Quinn was with his years behind the Leafs bench. I know he liked the older players and prior to the salary cap the Leafs were notorious for buying high priced talent in order to make the playoffs. They didn't scout much and it showed in their poor draft picks.  If memory serves (and I could be wrong) the Leafs have only made the playoffs once since Quinn left ....right??? Dan O.
883389,LostAnotherOne,2014-11-26 22:36:00,956,"Ok I am sick and tired of these so called T.V. hockey analyst that have never played the game or at least had nothing to do with the game at the NHL level.  I love watching Sportsnet Central at noon with Kipper and Mcclean and listening to what they have to say, but when they seem to take the day off and are replaced with guys who never played I shut it right off.  Hockey Night in Canada is doing alright with Hurdy, Kipper, and even Oates (love seeing Oates in there and glad he didn't bombed it like Domi did).  Host Stroumboulopoulos (yes I looked it up how you spell it lol) is growing on me, but I do miss Ron Maclean.  Elliot and Mackenzie need to go too.  Just venting guys that's all.  I love my hockey"

882527,BillM,2014-11-23 04:14:00,17367,"Nice turn around from the 1st and 2nd periods!   Nice to see Holland bang in a goal!  Bozaks short handed one was sweeet!  Let's hope Polak is ok, that didn't look good."

882572,SuperDave,2014-11-23 14:55:00,204,"Another great game. Don't know what it is about Detroit, but the Leafs seem to play well against them(most times). Bozak played his best game of the year imo."
882577,BillM,2014-11-23 16:06:00,17367,Nice slew foot by Tatar in the corner!  Anyone else catch that?
882620,LostAnotherOne,2014-11-23 21:00:00,956,Solid win last night.  Big shorthanded goal by Bozak.  I guess its Kessels turn with the backrubs tonight.
882623,manitoubass2,2014-11-23 21:19:00,11391,I never caught it. I'd have to rewatch it to see.  That Tartar is one hell of a good player though and developing into a star.  It would be horrible if he did that on purpose
882633,BillM,2014-11-23 21:51:00,17367,"I could be wrong, but I swear that's what I saw during the replay."
882674,Oggie,2014-11-24 01:02:00,588,Lucic was yapping and he got caught!  I love it!!! Dan O.
882675,Oggie,2014-11-24 01:06:00,588,It is silly to salute the fans at centre ice if they haven't played well. They're setting themselves up for a booing!  I could care less if they show their appreciation just put in an effort that's all the appreciation I need. Dan O.
882676,manitoubass2,2014-11-24 01:14:00,11391,he wasnt ready to fight!  hahahahahahaha  ??? Lucic caught a nice shot with his face

882042,BillM,2014-11-20 23:29:00,17367," Like I said.  Bernier didn't play for them that year.  Last year was Bernier's first year with the team.  It was Reimer that, aka Optimus Reim, that got them to game 7.  I must have had my eggs laced with crack this morning."
882062,DRIFTER_016,2014-11-21 01:00:00,10439,WOOHOO!!!!! Plan the parade the Leafs are back!!!!!
882070,tb4me,2014-11-21 01:25:00,3295, I must have had my eggs laced with crack this morning. Ya Bill Optimus Reims took us to game 7 against Boston..Matt that Kessel thing made me laugh..He does look like such a geek most times..lol
882075,BillM,2014-11-21 01:56:00,17367,"Boston is so fresh in my mind I thought it was earlier this year, lol!  Good game so far tonight, good tempo, lots of chances."

882089,Raf,2014-11-21 03:57:00,3495,"all  is well  as atrocious as those last two losses were, they are just that.. merely 2 losses.  doesn't matter if you lose 1-0 or 10-1, just a loss."

I mean all that's on the radio here is Canucks talk. I find myself becoming a fan of the Canucks and now hating the Leafs.........   NOT!!!!

881632,Sebastian,2014-11-19 03:51:00,208,"Horrible game. No quick fix. I will still watch the next bunch of games. Curious how they react but i think they will get smoked by Tampa, Detroit, Pittsburgh, and Washington. I sense a big trade or coach firing if they tank those 4 games."

After taking the leafs to the playoffs for the first time in a long time, and to game 7, and then to be a backup must be tough."

People tend to focus on one game, then throw in the towel, as of right now they're still playing above 500 hockey.    As for another team in Toronto?

I agree with everything here..Just please dont say bring back Orr..lol  As for free agents signing here, they first of all would want to be here.. Think about it this way..Higher taxes in Canada..Some states the players are not taxed at all (from what I understand). Then there is our weather. Now look at what has happened 3 times now to James Reimers wife April..Threatened and verbally assaulted on Twitter. Once last season and now twice this season..What free agent in their right mind would want to play here? The only good players we will ever get with our ignorant fan base is ones traded here.."
881530,manitoubass2,2014-11-18 23:15:00,11391," I watched a few weeks back and they discussed the tax issue, possibly on TSN or Sportsnet. Phil Kessel has a contract heavily based on incentive to offset taxes. I wanna say it was over 30% but I cant remember. they named a few US cities where it was FAR lower.  nashville, tampa and florida had the lowest taxes I think. oddly follewd by calgary and edmonton if I remember correctly"

881583,Oggie,2014-11-19 01:31:00,588,I hate watching Phaneuf. He's out of shape and slow.  Take that C off of his chest and give it to JVR or Lupul when he returns.  I think Carlyle's days are number unfortunately.  It isn't his fault but he's not coaching anymore. I see Jake Gardiner out on the power play right after he got caught on the first goal.  He needs to be sat not rewarded. I think the coach has given up and it's reflected in his team.  Make the change before Christmas so we still have a team that COULD make the playoffs. This skid isn't going to end any time soon. Carlyle is old news to these guys. All the one liners have been used and all the rabbits are out of the hat ................something has to change.

881264,fish_fishburn,2014-11-17 18:40:00,1311,Or maybe hire Tiger Williams and Wendle Clark as new assistant coaches. Wendle was a one of my favorite players when he played. To bad he was on the wrong team. The roster they have now is way to soft.

881304,blaque,2014-11-17 21:45:00,2419,what ever happened to the philosophy when your getting a whipping on the score board to just grab a hold of someone and pound the piss out of them.  I was waiting for that.......especiallly with so many leaf fans in our building to play for. Just never happened. I think they felt a little life when it went to 4-2 at the end of the 2nd and put the fists on hold. When they went back down 4 goals in the 3rd.......i think it was just too late and they just wanted to get outta there

881352,manitoubass2,2014-11-18 00:20:00,11391,I find it hilarious that they even bother. First time I watched the intermission Strombo looked so lost and he could barely hold a hockey stick haha
881354,DRIFTER_016,2014-11-18 00:27:00,10439,Surprised they didn't hire Oprah for that position. She knows how to interview. Probably knows more about hockey than Snuffleupagus as well!!!!
881356,Oggie,2014-11-18 00:37:00,588,Carlyle is old school and he'd like to bench guys who are obviously not buying into the system but where does he start.  Half the team would be benched by the middle of the first period many games.  Jack Gardiner has a million dollar set of skills but a five cent brain when it comes to hockey sense.  He hates getting hit and he dumps the puck anywhere he can.  I'd trade him or put him in the Marlies before he's ruined.  Somebody said Phaneuf is a fourth or fifth defman and that's dead on.  As his ice time goes up his errors increase exponentially.  I think he was on for nearly every goal in Buffalo.  If he's hurt he better say something before the fans get on him.
881357,Oggie,2014-11-18 00:38:00,588,Yeah George is a fish out of water. There is no natural flow to anything he does.  I long for the CBC format.

881426,davey buoy,2014-11-18 14:55:00,5505,Pick better players maybe? Other teams do.
881428,fish_fishburn,2014-11-18 14:56:00,1311,Its about how they spend the money. There is no issue about the team not spending the money. First thing they should do is not offer any contracts where the player wants a no trade clause. You want a no trade clause go play somewhere else. A lot of the problems have come from these G.M.'s spending money like drunken sailors.
881429,BillM,2014-11-18 15:04:00,17367,Pick better players maybe? Other teams do.  If it were only that easy.  You just don't go buy players and win Stanley Cups.  What players don't you like on the current team and who would you replace them with?
881477,davey buoy,2014-11-18 20:07:00,5505," If it were only that easy.  You just don't go buy players and win Stanley Cups.

We need some REAL first and second line players,grant you we have a couple,You tell me how other teams get free agents?,and why the Leafs would sign P-nough for that crappy contract?,.I may be a bigger supporter than you,but this is reality,and I'm afraid it's not going to change any time soon Bill.Did you hear there were tickets available for tonights game?,When has that ever happened.All over the radio,it's time the fans speak up finally ,JMO Bill,don't get to caught up in it but I see the same ole same ole."
881484,BillM,2014-11-18 20:46:00,17367,"Who cares about Dion, he's a D man and does a good job playing against the best lines in the league.  I'm all for replacing him, but at what cost and who are you going to get that's going to take those minutes?   And then, who's even an available FA to take that spot?   I would love to see the Leafs actually get a leader out on the ice, because that's what they need.  Even if the C is slapped on Dions jersey, he's not doing that job.  Hell, I'd rather see it on Komarov, at least he gets the entire team going.   Also, it's been 18 games, I wouldn't toss in the towel just yet.   If it wasn't for a complete end of the season slump they would have easily made it into the playoffs last year, easily.   So many people want a fire sale, trying to replace the entire team at once.  Give Shannie and the new kid from the Sault a chance."
881486,manitoubass2,2014-11-18 20:52:00,11391,"yep. c on komarov.

881487,BillM,2014-11-18 21:01:00,17367,"If there was anyone I would have liked to see them keep around it would have been Gary Roberts.  I also liked the team more when they had the big boys out there (Orr, Mclaren) and they punished you..  To me, the team that lost against Boston in that awful game 7 has been my fav so far.  I loved their toughness and style of play back then."

Agreed they have lost the one thing that worked for them,PUNCH,surprisingly the coaches don't see it ,or don't want to go that route.What's another year ,right?.Shanny should or better do something ,or the Leafs fans will even express more of their  their disgust.Rightfully so IMO.

881004,blaque,2014-11-16 03:17:00,2419,"There was a ""let's go raptors""  chant at one point.  And leafs garments being discarded. Rough crowd"
881005,blaque,2014-11-16 03:18:00,2419,"Glad RJ got to see and partially call a win  I know,  I know...... ""shut up blaque"""
881023,muddler,2014-11-16 10:19:00,623,I think Buffalo has it all figured out. Just play short handed.
881108,BillM,2014-11-16 21:00:00,17367,"There was a ""let's go raptors"" chant at one point. And leafs garments being discarded. Rough crowd  LOL!!!!  I missed the game but that's absolutely hilarious!"
881188,Oggie,2014-11-17 00:58:00,588,Well they resolved one big problem.  The starting goalie is Bernie and Rimmer should only see the nets when Bernie is hurt or is struggling and needs relief.  No more experimenting nail his A** to the bench for the rest of the season.  Dione Phaneuf should be embarrassed by his lack of effort. It's one thing to not play well; it's another to mail it in without an effort.  I'd sit him and Gardiner for the next game.
881189,glen,2014-11-17 01:03:00,2641,Dion is not well.  That's my guess.  Kipryos was on leafs lunch a week and a half ago.  He said Gardiner dosnt belong in the nhl. Letting the other team get the puck from your corner. I agree.
881196,BillM,2014-11-17 01:36:00,17367,Kypreos is the last guy that should be talking about hockey.  I can't believe Sportsnet actually puts him on the air.   He's the stupidest person I've ever listened to.
881210,leaf4,2014-11-17 02:54:00,2466,"LOL agreed Kypreos is definitely the last guy that should be talking, says some of the most ridiculous stuff, and if I'm not mistaken when discussing Gardiners recent contract he was praising it saying it was a win win especially for the leafs with the upside he has as a young defender with a high upside"
881213,bow slayer,2014-11-17 03:33:00,1074,"nothing wrong with Dion other than he is overrated,overpayed and a #3-4 Dman at best,there is not a team in the NHL that would take him and his horrible contract for a bag of pucks"
881226,Craigson,2014-11-17 12:53:00,117,Woooo Go Habs Go!!  Just keeps getting better!
881245,fish_fishburn,2014-11-17 17:11:00,1311,"The Leafs players should all be ashamed of themselves. I would start sitting players but not in the press box. Pick a player, any player really, and let them slide the pine for a period or two or the whole game. Why reward players with a regular shift for a sub par performance. I feel for you leaf fans but this team has absolutely no heart or pride in themselves. Until that changes its going to be the same results over and over."

881260,fish_fishburn,2014-11-17 18:33:00,1311,Tranquilizers? If half the team walked around with split lips and a few black eyes it might bring these guys together. At least it would look like there trying at least.

880614,DRIFTER_016,2014-11-13 20:45:00,10439,BWAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!  
880624,leaf4,2014-11-13 21:31:00,2466,OMG DRIFTER THAT VIDEO IS AMAZING!!!
880631,lookinforwalleye,2014-11-13 22:09:00,4399,Big win for the boys. Always nice to beat the Bruins once in a while.  They will probably be pissed and take it out on my Habs tonite!!!
880632,muddler,2014-11-13 22:13:00,623,Yup a good game for the loafs. Every once in a while good things happen to the Laffs too. Let's see how they do when Chara gets back. I wouldn't get the floats out just yet LF.  It won't take long for teams to start hitting fat boy and he'll have  his normal games. Then the same old same old will start all over again.  muddler
880633,glen,2014-11-13 22:17:00,2641,Floats on stand by.   So excited I couldn't sleep all night. Now let's see the Habs lay a beating on them tonight.   Go Price.
880634,misfish,2014-11-13 22:18:00,29133,Habs will get SPANKED.
880675,SuperDave,2014-11-14 01:03:00,204,I have to give the Leafs credit. They knew how they had to play and actually did it for 60 min. Total team effort. Boston didn't even show up for that one.
880702,Joeytier,2014-11-14 02:44:00,3990,They didn't show up tonight either.  Looking like another great win for Mtl.  Nice to see Gonchar out there on the PP and 'role' players like Weise and  Gallagher absolutely lighting it up on the ice
880704,lookinforwalleye,2014-11-14 02:57:00,4399, Brian any other predictions you would like to share??
880705,lookinforwalleye,2014-11-14 02:59:00,4399,Bruins defence is brutal....some plug named Trotman on the power play....
880707,BillM,2014-11-14 03:20:00,17367,Boston needs some confidence without Chara in the line up.  It's scary how they play without him.
880708,DRIFTER_016,2014-11-14 03:23:00,10439,Boston needs some confidence without Chara in the line up.  It's scary how they play without him.  Scary AWESOME!!!!
880709,lookinforwalleye,2014-11-14 03:36:00,4399,Boston needs some confidence without Chara in the line up.  It's scary how they play without him.  Be interesting to see how he bounces back after the injury...they are now saying he will be out long than expected and 38 years old soon!!  I know the Habs miss skating around him...
880788,jimmer,2014-11-14 18:37:00,2730,They were doing not bad without Chara for a while. I think they miss Krecji more.
880797,tb4me,2014-11-14 18:45:00,3295, Be interesting to see how he bounces back after the injury...they are now saying he will be out long than expected and 38 years old soon!!  I know the Habs miss skating around him... Whats wrong with big Z anyway? Yikes 38 he may only have one year left if he can get healthy..Big guys dont heal so fast..Im living proof of that ...lol
880827,davey buoy,2014-11-14 23:17:00,5505,"If only the leafs could pound him again like they did a couple years ago,if he comes back.Remembering him dropping to his knees a couple times.He can be beat down."
880294,tb4me,2014-11-11 02:40:00,3295,"Lol I love how you think the Leaf fan started that..From what I seen in that vid was a guy in red tossing the first kinda soso swing..Even more shocking is a Leaf fan wasted a 16 dollar beer on a sens fan, he was just trying to cool him down...ha ha ha"
880296,tb4me,2014-11-11 02:45:00,3295,"In related news ,I heard today it happens all the time at all venues but rarely caught on video..Man did they go down hard...Is everyone ok?"
880303,BillM,2014-11-11 03:18:00,17367,"Is Matt just playing dumb or is he just legally blind?  Did he miss the Ottawa fan taking the first shot?  LOL!!!  I hope that Senorita fan enjoyed his shower!!!!!!!!!!  I'm sure I'd be as pissed as that guy if I attended my teams home game and saw more Leaf fans in the stands..  Man, that's gotta buuuuuuuurn!"
880307,irishfield,2014-11-11 03:27:00,26272,"Looked like it had the ""Harvick"" help to get it going! lol Wonder how many of them cement steps they cleared on the way down..."

880317,solopaddler,2014-11-11 10:18:00,8605,Stupid kids. And yeah watching the video it did appear the Sen's fan started things along with his chirpy girlfriend. Pathetic display by both sides.
880329,AKRISONER,2014-11-11 13:53:00,5558,can we all just take a moment to laugh at the fact that ottawa is the only canadian team in the entire league that gets out cheered at home. Youd think you were watching a game in florida or Buffalo by the way the crowd sounded lol!  Pathetic excuse for a Canadian hockey franchise.
880497,leaf4,2014-11-13 01:28:00,2466,"Great game so far, loving the energy the buds have tonight!"
880498,BillM,2014-11-13 01:47:00,17367,Leivo should have made it 2-0!
880500,blaque,2014-11-13 01:53:00,2419,I don't think I can make it thru the entire game on NBCSN. Keith Jones is about the only talking head I can take for more than 2 minutes
880501,leaf4,2014-11-13 02:00:00,2466,"Definitely should've, if that were almost anyone else that's a sure goal, not sure why he would've skated by the net as he did, not a goal scorers play that's for sure lol"
880502,leaf4,2014-11-13 02:03:00,2466,WOW Kessel makes it look just way too easy  RIELLYYYYYY!!! What a way to start the second!!
880503,BillM,2014-11-13 02:06:00,17367,"Kessel's snapshot is just deadly, Rask didn't have a chance."
880504,tb4me,2014-11-13 02:12:00,3295,Great game so far..Rask is useless without Chara and company in front of him..Good to see us hand it to Boston for a change..
880505,leaf4,2014-11-13 02:12:00,2466,This game is awesome!!! lol
880506,blaque,2014-11-13 02:19:00,2419,"How long before Marchand Spears a groin,  or Lucic runs a goalie?"
880507,Steve,2014-11-13 02:23:00,2075,i think things are going to get dirty...  boston isn't going to be able to handle this much longer...one more Leaf goal and things are going to get interesting...  time for another cold one
880508,BillM,2014-11-13 02:33:00,17367,"How long before Marchand Spears a groin, or Lucic runs a goalie?  Komarov did a good job at smearing Marchands face into the boards, lol!"

880511,leaf4,2014-11-13 03:51:00,2466,What a game!! hopefully a game like that carries forward into the next game against the booins and we can win some more points against them
880535,grimsbylander,2014-11-13 13:11:00,3016,"I'm happy for Kessel. Given the history, he must be pumped when he has a game like that against Boston."

This has been all over TSN radio all day today about the conduct of the laff fans in all rinks around the league. Totally classless. If this is what it's like to be a laffs fan,  then clearly you take it way too seriously.  Sad!  And by the way, I would never even entertain the stupidity shown in that video. Especially not from a laffs fan!"
880257,DRIFTER_016,2014-11-11 00:31:00,10439,Seems the lippy trailer trash blonde started the whole thing.
879235,SuperDave,2014-11-03 01:17:00,204,"Looked like the same team as last year to me. Being outshot badly in the 3rd, having the puck on their stick and not getting it out, Riemer standing on his head.... but willtake the 2 points. Whats with pretty boy Lupol he must be made of paper mache or something."
879282,fish_fishburn,2014-11-03 15:24:00,1311,"Some athletes are like that no matter what their size or strength. Injury prone maybe. Remember Eric Lindros, big tough guy with a head like an egg."

It also didn't help that guys head hunted him (ie Scott Stevens)  I think Lupul's injury was a complete fluke (Tripped on a stick in practice, broke a bone in his hand) even during the interview he looked like he couldn't believe what happened.  Let's hope he recovers, he's been having a great season so far."
879293,AKRISONER,2014-11-03 16:41:00,5558,"Lupes has ran into more bad luck than any guy on the team. His broken arm the other year was from a shot that deflected and shattered a bone, then he trips on a stick and breaks his hand.  The guy is just really unlucky.  Itd be one thing if its a naggin knee or concussion issues, but breaking bones from tripping or getting hit with a puck, theres not much you can do there.  The leafs need to play better than they did in the 3rd if they want to survive. You cant let 27 shots a period and expect to win very often. You take the 2 points and focus on what you did right in periods 1 and 2...i think they were lucky in period 3.  In other news   I just got tickets to go see the oilers in Buffalo Friday. The first time i get to see my second fave team play (yes i like to pain a lot, im an oilers and leafs fan)"

The most i paid last spring was $100 a ticket for 4th row top of the circle Bruins end on a Saturday night for their game against Tampa. The least?

879107,tb4me,2014-11-02 02:08:00,3295,That was amazing..Reimer was a wall.. Komorav was a stud..The whole team played well..I liked the new kid too Carrek? if they could only play like that most nights..
879161,BillM,2014-11-02 17:13:00,17367,"That was amazing..Reimer was a wall.. Komorav was a stud..The whole team played well..I liked the new kid too Carrek? if they could only play like that most nights..  Yeah really good game last night.  Even though they were fenced in a bit at the end, it wasn't like they were running around like chickens with their heads cut off.  Kept Chicago on the boards and Reims took care of the rest.  Komarov has been their best acquisition so far, I was so happy when they got him back.  They missed him more then anyone last season."
878620,BillM,2014-10-29 03:55:00,17367,"10 shots I think for Buffalo.  Leafs were on them the entire time, exactly what they need to do."

Too late lol, one of the players did that for him right after the game  Jorges went on a little rant of his own........doesnt mean much to me however. The usual ""gotta be better"", ""thats just not good enough"", ""gotta hold ourselves accountable"" kinda Bull"
878639,AKRISONER,2014-10-29 13:26:00,5558,"If the leafs played like they did last night against a team like LA or Chicago etc they would have lost.  Their passes were sloppy and scrambled. it was a tough game to watch in person.  Kadri looked crap (surprise surprise) Gardiner started Shakey but then was a stud by the end. Kessel and Lupul looked dangerous, and Bozie was leaps and bounds better than kadri.  Buffalo is my take of the Connor Mcdavid sweepstakes, although apparently Carolina is even worse! Still no wins!"
878642,BillM,2014-10-29 13:42:00,17367,That was the best game they've played all season.  They actually had a back check.  Did you drink a few many too beers before the game?
878644,AKRISONER,2014-10-29 13:47:00,5558,"they didnt need a backcheck, buffalo was so dismal they couldnt even break out. The passing was sloppy and guys were missing pucks everywhere, buffalo is just so bad that they couldnt even capitalize on it."

878680,jimmer,2014-10-29 19:43:00,2730,I was okay with their play considering there are a couple of leaf killers on that team. Gionta and Moulson.

878696,tb4me,2014-10-29 21:08:00,3295,LOL @ Matt.. When will you learn..Comparing the Sens to the leafs is pointless..They both stink..The only difference is the Leafs actually have more then 2 fans..I also have faith the Leafs will finish ahead of of your sens.. 9 games in we shall see...

Leafs will make more headlines and money finishing last than Sens will winning the cup. Thats just the way it is. Get over it. We're not delusional. We are loyal. We dont need to rationalize. Most people dont expect the Leafs to make the playoffs. Will that stop me from watching? No.

The Toronto Maple Leafs rank No. 1 on the list, valued at $1.15 billion. Teams north of the border dominate the top of Forbes NHL valuations thanks to typically higher attendance and higher arena revenue than their U.S rivals. For the first time since Forbes began tracking NHL team valuations in 1998, three of the leagues five most valuable teams Toronto Maple Leafs (No.1), Montreal Canadiens (No.3), Vancouver Canucks (No.4) are Canadian. This is also the first time that every Canadian franchise ranks among the top 16 in the 30 team league. The New York Rangers (No.2) and Stanley Cup champion Chicago Blackhawks (No.5) are the only U.S. teams to crack the top five.The average NHL team now has an enterprise value (equity plus debt, less cash) of $413 million, 46% more (enterprise value-weighted) than a year ago. Operating income (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) averaged $7 million per team during the lockout-shortened 2012-13 season, the second highest profit since the 1997-98 season.The Top 10 Most Valuable Teams in the NHL are:     "

877210,tb4me,2014-10-18 15:53:00,3295,I didnt watch muc of that game..From what I seen was a sad example of hockey from Toronto. Detroit sure is a dirty team. Always crosschecking behind the play and hitting 5 feet out from the boards. Tonnes of interference too. Is the cluch and grab allowed back in the NHL because it was  obvious it was happening in front of the net. Refs weren't calling it at all.. JVR got mugged a few times from what I seen. Either way that sucked and thank frig for darts and beer...lol

What a great game on Sat, even if the goal 10 seconds left in OT was a tough pill to swallow.   I loved the back and forth hockey in the 3rd period and the entire OT.  Good good hockey (Even if the refs called like 500 penalties)"

FYI the jersey throwers so far have all been guys wearing ISO jersey knock offs. I own one and can spot them from a mile away. I have one they are 30 bucks and crap quality. No one in their right mind would actually throw away a 200 dollar jersey regardless of how crap the team is.

877518,AKRISONER,2014-10-20 18:14:00,5558,"Never said the team wasn't crap, you would have to be delusional to think they were good, just like thinking the Senators are a good team.  If someone tells you that Toronto is as good as LA Chicago Dallas or St. Louis then they are probably blind or living in 1993. If you think the senators are respectable at all at any time then you are probably delusional as well."
877519,Headhunter,2014-10-20 18:26:00,5703,"I don't understand why the guffuffal about jersey's thrown on the ice. It's not a flag of one's country, it's a jersey. One could argue that the Leafs have thrown all there fans under a bus for the 40 odd years... and is it not any ones right to do with what they please with their own possessions? Personally, I will not update my Leaf's jersey (from the 70's!) unless and until the teams performance warrants a change... it's been my stance since well, the 80's! LOL I cannot financially support losing with no ramifications... HH"
877520,fish_fishburn,2014-10-20 18:42:00,1311,Maybe the team should hand out towels before every home game and the fans will keep there jerseys and just throw in the towel instead.
877521,AKRISONER,2014-10-20 18:46:00,5558,"At this point it has become more than just about the jersey being thrown on the ice. really the gesture is old now, its more about creating delays in the hockey game. throwing them during faceoffs and crap. It had impact the first time it was done, if a jersey gets thrown on the ice every single time they lose the message is lost.  Still better than being booed and your hometown fans being out cheered by the opposition fans while at home. I haven't ever heard of this happening in any Canadian city except one."

Now that Rogers is in the mix it did not auto renew and I have to renew through Rogers for twice the cost of last year. Money grubbing bastages!!!!

Only entertaining part was Nick and Messier talking about the ""old days"" lining up at a faceoff....  Rogers cannot continue that junk. Someone is going to have to get through to them and advise that their ""idea"" is failing...miserably.  No one wants to see guys in suits pretending to be on the ice.....And I don't know much about the history of George Stroumboulopoulos but I don't think he has any idea about how hockey actually is played.

876480,leaf4,2014-10-13 03:09:00,2466,"real good game this night, lines were clicking even with them being changed up a bit here and there, also helped lundquist wasn't having the best outing lol  also hopefully Reimers doing alright! says he is and he just left for the league protocol so that's good hopefully that's all we have to hear of it!"
876484,glen,2014-10-13 03:57:00,2641,Riemer didn't let the first shot in so that helped.  He made some nice saves too.  I hope he starts next game.  The D was better. But they still got beat to the puck too much.  Keep Gartner out for a few games.  I would like to see him use his speed in his own end and be the first one on the puck. The sit back and let the other team get it dosent work.  Thomas kaberle must have coached that play.  The worst play in hockey and makes me puke.
876491,Sebastian,2014-10-13 12:22:00,208,"Komarov, Clarkson and Santorelli were cycling the puck so well in the Rangers zone. This was Clarksons best game so far as a Leaf. Leafs were good but you can tell they let off the gas in the 3rd. They coasted with that lead."
876533,BillM,2014-10-13 17:30:00,17367,"3rd line has been the only consistent line they've had.    I'm liking Panik as well, seems like he doesn't mind throwing the body around."

876340,Sebastian,2014-10-12 02:38:00,208,It was a good game.....the first 4 minutes. And then we got out worked and out muscled off the puck. Pathetic game. Still love the team. The fan who threw a $200 jersey is an idiot. Give it to some kid. Its the second game of the season. Things will come around. Kessel is a good player. He just needs to burn off the summer beer belly.  As for Dons rant.....pointless. 2 years ago he complained that the whole team was american and we needed more canadians. Now we need more toronto players. This is not the USSR vs Canada. Good players come from all over. Clarkson is a 5.5million dollar Toronto boy and he is useless. I wouldve kept Grabo for that money.....even if Don thought that the Leafs were communists.
876341,Sebastian,2014-10-12 02:42:00,208,Don seems to forget the Toronto boys are the first ones to take off to the tropical non hockey markets to live normal lives. No one wants to be under a microscope in the hockey universe of Toronto. Can't go outside without hearing every fan tell you that you are the best or that you suck.
876344,glen,2014-10-12 02:52:00,2641,Players should be ready to play at game one of the season.  When you miss the playoffs by a point remember your effort at the start.  So do you guys want to win or skate around and fall down.  Gobble gobble.
876345,Sebastian,2014-10-12 02:55:00,208,"Agreed. His fault. There are still many games left in the season. Hopefully they get it together. Crosby looks like he's ready to hoist up another cup already. I dont know if any eastern team will be able to compete with Minnesota, Chicago, LA, Dallas."
876357,SuperDave,2014-10-12 13:23:00,204,"For the first time in a while the Leafs are meeting my expectations. I expected nothing and that's what they are giving. Carlyle will be gone in 10 games. Not that its his fault but they should have changed things up. Look at Winnipeg bringing in Paul Maurice last year it made a difference. I wish Hamilton had a team, so I had someone other than the Leafs to cheer for."

Oh well, tonight's another night.  What was worse than the actual game was the travesty Rogers has turned HNIC into.

875760,pairofgreenhorns,2014-10-07 19:43:00,133,"Well I have waited long enough to reply (wanted to see what the leafs final moves were.)  Opening Night:  JVR        Bozak     Kessel Kozun     Kadri      Lupul Komorov Santorelli Clarkson Winnik     Holland    Frattin  Phaneuf  Robidas Gardiner  Reilly Percy       Polak  Santorelli and Holland may be switched. This leaves Ashton, Booth, Leivo and Franson on the sidelines I believe.   What I think they needed to do: Resign Reimer because he has no trade value and he is a good backup when his game is on he can try to take over number 1 (never gonna happen). Improve culture. Change defensive and forechecking system. Upgrade bottom six players to personnel who can play more than three minutes a game and possibly add scoring depth. This would enable us to roll four lines and not have your first two lines play as many minutes so they still have energy at the end of the season. Getting enough guys on tryout to compete for jobs so your players never have a false sense of entitlement midway through the year is important. They need to continue to develop their youngsters and I think they needed to add defensive minded defenseman, and draft well in the first round.  How they did: With the surprising outbreak of Kozun in leafs camp I believe our penalty kill likely to consist of Kozun and Winnik is leaps and bounds better than last year.  As far as culture change; Well I am very happy with the new direction the Leafs seem to be heading and the changes they have made to the environment. They are changing the in game experience to be more exciting and less commercial/corporate when you go see a game live (change put forth by Shanahan). They have overhauled the assistant captains and assistant management (front office) with some of the brightest young minds in hockey today as well as some future replacements should Carlyle or Nonis meet their dismissal. They are now using the money they make to better there team by bringing in the top on ice operations people from Calgary and funding an analytics department made up of some analytical studs.  It seems Carlyle has brought in a new defensive system, breakout, and forecheck which may be better suited to the current roster than it was last year. This is what I can tell from all the preseason games and the one practice I watched but only time will tell.  They have replaced the bottom 6 forwards with more hockey talent then braun. Im sure orr and McLaren will clear waivers so if we need them they will still be called up.  We quite possibly drafted one of the most talented players in the draft in young William Nylander, and I am very happy to see him sent back to Sweden, Modo to be precise. This league excels at developing young players, he really just needs to gain some size and not try to do everything himself in some situations, he will be a leafs staple in 2 years time.  I was impressed at some of the depth of talent in the organization. The marlies have had a great team the last few years and it showed. Carrick, Bodie, Holzer, Smith, and Biggs will all likely make it to the big leagues one day. And Kozun, Percy, and Leivo had a great showing and seem to be poised to make the team or at least be a constant call up this year.  Bringing in Polak and Robidas will help settle the blue line down and provide some great mentorship for the youngsters on defense. Furthermore, we now have an equal number of left handed and right handed shots which will help Dion Phaneuf the most. Getting him back to his natural side will help him get the shot off quicker in the offensive zone. More importantly it should eliminate a lot of his sloppy giveaways since he will have more options coming out of his own end on the breakout while on his forehand.  They resigned Reimer which is good. Maybe he will play great and up his trade value so he can be dealt midway or maybe he will push Bernier to keep the starting job. I don't believe Reimer has the ability to be Toronto's numero uno but healthy competition is great.  All in all I would say I am happy with the changes made so far. Everyone can say that they needed to get a number one centre or offload Phaneuf but I assure you those are near impossible deals to come by and offloading your captain after a terrible season doesn't make much sense when his trade value is at its lowest.  The youngsters keep developing. Gardiner is poised to make a big jump up the stat sheets this year, and if Reilly can just avoid a sophomore slump that's great for them. Kadri trained hard in the offseason and worked on his faceoffs and his quick shot release so hopefully we will see a jump in icetime and production from his line as well.  That's all I can think of for now, hope you enjoyed the read whether you agree or not!!!!!

Thanks for taking the time to share. .As for missing the playoffs. I think were in but barely..Heres my line of thinking. Who else is going to get in? All the good talent seemed to have went west. Buffalo will suck as they always do, Carolina now has no D or a Goalie.Montreal gave away most of thier big D , Islanders did make some moves and they may get in this year.Rangers, Philly questionable in comparison to Toronto.  Boston maybe Detroit who knows.Sens and devils have no chance. Tampa and Columbus will most likely get in too. I also predict Washington to be and big ol Nopers.This is all just my opinion and take it for what you will   I personally like the Leafs chances (to get in not win the cup). They added 2 solid lines and shed a ton of dead weight.. Im excited to see what we have. Santorelli, Winnik, and Leo K give us a legit PK. I think Pollack is a beast and if Robidas can stay healthy he will be a stud..If not we have Percy and Granburg waiting for their turns.  Percy will be sent down when Franny is healthy and he took part in the entire practice today. Go Leafs Go!"

875843,lookinforwalleye,2014-10-08 02:53:00,4399,Interesting in looking at the power rankings from various outlets some have the Habs as high as 3 in the east and some have them missing the playoffs...The leafs seem to be consistently ranked 20th to 24th.
875845,lookinforwalleye,2014-10-08 02:54:00,4399,denial...isn't that a river????
875883,AKRISONER,2014-10-08 13:51:00,5558,"without a doubt this is a better team than last year, but remember they finished 12th, i see them slide in around 9th-8th. If they do make the playoffs it will be barely.  Biggest points for this season, if JVR Kessel Kadri and Lupul can keep tearing it up on offence, they will get the leafs into the playoffs, these guys all have the potential to be a point a game."

875908,glen,2014-10-08 18:09:00,2641,I like what the leafs have done.  Great interview with Nonis yesterday.  The talk of more defence minded D men.  I say they make the playoffs.  Go leafs go.

875214,lookinforwalleye,2014-10-03 14:11:00,4399,"I'm sure Yzerman was questioned when he was made captain so young, Karlsson has a Norris trophy and has led the defense scoring in the league twice, he also had the most points for a defenseman  since he joined the league. He leads the team in minutes played per game and is said to already be a leader in the room. As far as I can see, the sky's the limit for him. Looks like things are looking up for the Sens in the future. All he needs to do is work on that +/- stat....career minus guy!"

875330,solopaddler,2014-10-04 13:29:00,8605,"As an impartial Leaf fan:  -Karlsson is a stud, I think Ottawa made the right choice for captain (would much rather have him as captain than Phaneuf) -Crazy contract for Ryan, no way would I have signed him to that. But then I never would have traded for him. That contract will be an albatross in two years. -Kozun has been great, hope he makes the team! -Percy has been solid too, can we please trade Franson now? -Overall I think our D is pretty scary. They're an injury or two away from complete disaster. No depth.  As always I remain optimistic. GO LEAFS!"

875482,Sebastian,2014-10-05 20:50:00,208,"Agreed. Hate the Sens but Karlsson is solid. Guy is still young and like matt said, sky is the limit. The salary cap will rise and you will begin to see deals in the 7-10million range. Let the Sens spend all their money on Ryan and Macarthur. Clarkson at 5 million was a worse move from the get go than any Sens signing.  I also love the Dion haters. Guy is always on the hook. Get him a real defenseman to play with. Franson is not a top 4 D man. Leafs dont have defensive depth as is. injuries have already started and season hasnt started. Its an 82 game season. Only Detroit manages to have an injured team and still get bailed out by their unknown amazing talent from the farm team. I cant wait for the season opener against the Habs!"
875510,muskymatt,2014-10-05 22:54:00,2608,"I had to think hard about whether the Ryan contract was going to be a good one. I believe it will, just because of the way he held out to see what his involvement was going to be like on the ice. He wanted more, wanted to be used in different situations. That, to me, means he's passionate and cares about how he plays. There is no question he has talent, 30 goal plus guy most of the time. I think if he is given the slack and responsibility, he'll excel. But, time will tell!"
875524,BillM,2014-10-05 23:38:00,17367,"The Sens had all kinds of cap room, they had to sign Ryan, I don't think they had much of a choice.."

The sportscaster went off the shelf towards sportsnet for not giving enough coverage of the canucks game. It was the ""local"" version and right after the game they did one canucks interview and then spent 10 minutes on the leafs game and 15 minutes on the new sportsnet studio. the guy was fuming. He said no one cares about he leafs in the pacific time. and its already midnight local to eastern time. So of course I called in after his tirade and luckily I was the first on air. I asked him what his thoughts were on the new Leafs this year and how  does he think they stack up in the east.     They hung up. For real. It was awesome."

Did you even bother to watch any hockey that year?  Or perhaps 93-94?  The best thing you've got to look forward to as a Senoritas fan is when Toronto comes to town.   That's the loudest that building will ever be.   Embrace it!"

874695,AKRISONER,2014-09-30 12:45:00,5558,"Franson has a bruised knee...it probably blew up a bunch because he burst a bursa sack so they were worried he had cracked it. He will most likely start the season.  Clarkson's orbital doesnt require surgery, so he will good to go as well, but will probably have to wear the bird cage or at least a visor. Some of us would prefer if he didnt play anyways and let one of the young guys have a shot."

This is the secret of the Leafs. It’s what makes them special. And as we embark on another lost season, it’s important to remember why we’re all here – to suffer together. It’s like church, except we never get to the part about redemption. It’s 100-per-cent crucifixion. It’s probably a good idea to bring your own nails. You wouldn’t believe what they charge for nails at the ACC. As they are fond of doing, ESPN took a nice little run at Toronto this week on that very subject. Canada’s hockey cross to bear is, according to a U.S.-based outlet that makes its money massaging U.S-based viewers and U.S-based readers, the worst team in all the world (or the United States and a few lucky places that touch it)..."

I've had good talks with some leafs and I have to be honest with you, the coaching and management don't want a win.

873682,AKRISONER,2014-09-23 13:06:00,5558,"never been much a kadri fan TBH  Although maybe the leafs have finally handled one of the prospects properly and forced him to develop his game to a level of his full capability.  The guy always had the skill to be a point a player game, but he completely lacked the work ethic, drive and grit it takes to be that kind of player in the NHL.  Theres a lot of guys that cry and cry about how kadri has been held back, i personally think he has been handled very well. Now in the final year of his entry level contract he has his opportunity to become a top line centre. The kid is only 23 years old, he is just coming into himself now. If he can prove that he is a bonafied top line guy scoring a point a game this season, then he will get the money he deserves.  Next season you have 15 million to sign franson bernier and kadri. They should be able to work it out.  Kadri needs to learn how to win a faceoff though if he wants to be a #1"

It makes the ""good"" players seem so much better because they are playing another team's AHL squad.  Kadri wont have that much time with the puck, and everyone else will move as fast as komarov when the real season starts.  Hopefully Clarkson and Kadri will be able to at least get off to a head start due to their off season training regiments so that the leafs can get some points early. Because after a month everyone else always catches up and gets back on pace.  The good news is that the leafs at least made some adjustments to the front end and hopefully this will assist on the forecheck so that they arent playing the entire game in their own end anymore.  The D still really worries me though."
873825,jimmer,2014-09-24 13:25:00,2730,You always know what you're going to get from Komarov and Bernier. It's the rest of the team that you never know what you're going to get night in night out. Kadri needs the consistency to make me a believer. I'm ready for the parade! LOL

With the points Kessel puts up, you let him do his thing, especially on the PP.  Is your boy Ryan afraid to sign that long term deal?  Seems that way from what I saw on SportsCentre today. Yup Kessle is the consummate team player all right! "
873114,Steve,2014-09-19 01:13:00,2075,i read that article and found it amusing that they rank Phoenix Coyotes as the top NHL franchise.  that's just as funny as labeling Toronto the worst.  clearly silly.
873115,BillM,2014-09-19 01:14:00,17367,Would you rather have a team player or someone that puts 37 goals and 43 assists on the board?  Toronto's PP was 6th in the league last year.    I wouldn't change a thing.

Last year he came into camp and was fat as heck, this is a direct quote that kessel told my friend ""meh i dont think ill get cut""  The guy is an elite scorer, more goals than crosby, more points than ovechkin, he gets to do whatever he wants and no one argues.

The team overall is a bit more well rounded up front. Clarkson will be better this year (cant be any worse) but once again will disappoint for what hes being paid.  Look for Bernier to further solidify his place as a number 1 goaltender in the league. There are a lot of haters as normal because hes a leaf, but I think the move to get will go down as one of the best moves they made in a long long time.  Leo will be fun to watch, the leafs defence will continue to struggle and I expect Carlyle to last no longer than December. Its not going to be a fun season overall to watch and I would be surprised at a playoff birth.  They still need a more defensively minded back end. Gardiner and rielly will impress as normal, but the defensive side of the game will still lack. Dion although everyone hates him, is a good D man (maybe not so much captain), hes just not capable of doing it all alone."

TORONTO - Tim Leiweke says a comment he made about players within the Toronto Maple Leafs organization having ""terrible"" character was not aimed at a specific player. Speaking to students at Ryerson University, the outgoing president and CEO of Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment said when addressing analytics in hockey that ""there are players we have in our organization today whose numbers are off the chart good and whose character is just terrible."" In an email response to The Canadian Press, Leiweke attempted to clarify what he meant. ""It was a general response that was intended to say that analytics are only as good as also making sure a player has character,"" Leiweke wrote. ""I find it amusing anyone can assume I was talking about a specific Leaf player."" In his address at Ryerson, Leiweke also addressed new Leafs presidentBrendan Shanahan's role in reshaping organizational philosophy and the summer hirings of Cam Charron and Darryl Metcalf that should add to the analytics department. MLSE confirmed last month Leiweke would only remain on the job until June 2015 or until a successor is appointed."

871484,muskymatt,2014-09-09 02:25:00,2608,"I love the hate this team generates, lol! "
871485,muskymatt,2014-09-09 02:26:00,2608,"I look forward to the upcoming season.  I greatly look forward to watching Leo play again.  Jay McClement and Dave Bolland are both huge losses.  And we still have that joke called Clarkson.  otherwise, it's going to be a fun season! The comedy in that quote is immeasurable."
871488,BillM,2014-09-09 02:57:00,17367,  You're off the hook Matt a Leafs thread without you wouldn't be the same
871504,Craigson,2014-09-09 11:03:00,117,"No Hate, just reality!!"
871212,tb4me,2014-09-07 21:41:00,3295,"With hockey and most importantly Leafs Season fast approaching, I figured id start a Leafs thread from a Leafs fan..Im excited to see the new team, we have an entire new 3rd and 4th lines..No more dead weights.. Orr Mclearen Ect all a thing of the past.Our first and second lines should be the same as last year. (witch is pretty awesome) our 3 and 4 are going to be among the best in the NHL.. Anyway im excited, something like 25 days till preseason hockeyGO LEAFS GO!!!!!"
871214,bow slayer,2014-09-07 21:54:00,1074,"no more dead weights?   Dion,Clarkson,Franson,Reimer,and alot of times Kadri......there are plenty of anchors still"
871215,davey buoy,2014-09-07 21:57:00,5505,"no more dead weights?   Dion,Clarkson,Franson,Reimer,and alot of times Kadri......there are plenty of anchors still I was waiting,didn't want to be the first to say.They sure have a tough battle ahead.I'll still pull for them,but I'm know where near convinced they have done anywhere near what they could have."
871224,glen,2014-09-07 22:22:00,2641,Who are the key new players?
871225,misfish,2014-09-07 22:30:00,29133,  Left and right goal posts and top bar. Not that their new. lol
871228,bushart,2014-09-07 22:58:00,2628,Really---beginning of Sept.----to pull this band-aid off.... one so slowly hair at a time just to miss the playoffs once again  Name the Additions that will make a diff this year from last  same goaltending----one  new defenceman who's not the difference maker.......same coach---smallish fwds  Definition of insanity-----doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result.  Good Luck
871231,Craigson,2014-09-07 23:08:00,117,"Hahahaha, best 3rd n 4th lines in the league? Come on, be honest with yourself OP. Cant even compare to teams like Anaheim, San Jose, St Louis, Chicago, LA, should I go on?"
871232,leaf4,2014-09-07 23:13:00,2466,"It's easy to make your point look good when you pull the past 2 stanley cup winners of the past 4 years and the western conference, start looking at the eastern conference where they actually play a majority of their games rather than the teams they play a lesser amount, looking at the leafs myself I do like the additions they made, but they should've tried to get derek roy for a center and another top tier defenseman, although I don't see cody franson being around very long unless he picks up his actual defense game."
871234,muskymatt,2014-09-07 23:16:00,2608,"I think Bolland will really step up this year! Oh wait........bahahahahahaha  .  The laffs have taken about 4 steps backwards, which is just perfect with me.    My prediction is an 30-52 record and another early season on the links  "
871236,muskymatt,2014-09-07 23:17:00,2608,..No more dead weights.. Bahahahahahahahahahahaha  
871238,Handlebarz,2014-09-07 23:28:00,3790,Matt it's awesome to see you posting here keep the smiles coming.  As for the leafs my blood is blue and I will always be a fan but am always happy that I don't waits the nice spring nights sitting in front of the TV watching hockey. Well there is my one and most likely last post in this thread.
871240,leaf4,2014-09-07 23:36:00,2466,also happy to be seeing this thread for the fact of
871241,tb4me,2014-09-07 23:55:00,3295,"seriously, Komarov, Santorelli, and Kontiola would be  pretty tough line to play against and awesome additions IMO. Clarkson will ultimately decide where the lines mesh up..Will he stink like last year , or will training with the likes of Crosby all summer improve his game?but now you potentially have 15 guys trying out for the 3rd & 4th lines; Aston,Bodie, Broll, Devane, Frattin, Kozun, Leivo, Santorelli, Smith, Holland, Winnik, Komarov, Kontiola, Booth. Thats a talented list of guys here .All that aside the Leafs can now roll 4 lines..We havent been able to do that for a couple years now..Im happy with this team, kinda wish Dion got moved but he didn't..So be it..Go Leafs Go!!!"
871243,glen,2014-09-08 00:07:00,2641,I just looked up the roster.  It's a bit different but it ain't better.
871250,lookinforwalleye,2014-09-08 00:58:00,4399,WHO...WHO...WHO...WHO...WHO...WHO...WHO...WHO...WHO...WHO...WHO...WHO...WHO...WHO...yes that is an incredible talent list!!!!

871254,big guy,2014-09-08 01:07:00,414,"You know why people don't start threads about the habs, or senaturds, or any of the ""teams"" out west?  Because no one cares about them, no one."
871255,BillM,2014-09-08 01:11:00,17367,Kadri had 50 points last season.  Do any of the haters bother to look up facts?  I'm guessing no(this being his first full 80 game season as well). Can't wait for this season!
871291,Craigson,2014-09-08 11:19:00,117,Hahahahahaha Stop it guys ur killin me here. Same conversations every fall. Kinda like Jays fans 3 months ago!!!
871292,davey buoy,2014-09-08 11:34:00,5505,As much as I don't think they didn't do anything close to what they could have.still fun entertainment!!!
871294,craigdritchie,2014-09-08 11:43:00,1586,"Once again I will boldly predict the same thing I have predicted every year for the past eight or nine seasons.  The Leafs will play like crazy in October and November, and probably hold first place at some point before Christmas (when it doesn't really matter). But come the new year, the injuries will begin, play will slump, inexperience will show and once again they will finish the season by watching the playoffs on TV. But they will play well enough in the dying days of the season to ensure they don't even get a decent draft pick. And Leaf fans will all say, wow, did you see how they got it together at the end? Next year, baby, next year!!  Sound familiar? It should, because that's exactly what has happened every year since Ed Belfour was in net. Is that now 10 years and counting?  There - I said it (again). Let the flaming begin."

There - I said it (again). Let the flaming begin. Bingo. I bleed blue and white but looking at the roster this year looks like much of the same. I do like the fact that hopefully we will be able to play all 4 lines though, which might help the top 6 not be totally gassed by the second half of the season. Either way I can't wait to watch some hockey...... GLG."
