934667,Cloudy15,2015-09-16 17:29:00,141,How isn't it booze?
934691,Cast-Away,2015-09-16 20:52:00,790,It could also be drugs.

Like you said, it gets dark fast now. Maybe someone forgot to put their lights on. Wont know until they are done the investigation.  Why they took off, who knows as well. To many things it could of been."

Maybe someone forgot to put their lights on. Wont know until they are done the investigation.  Why they took off, who knows as well. To many things it could of been. Ok, it could of been caused by hundreds of different things, but what is most probable? Why would someone flee the scene, no licence, stolen, scared, drugs and alcohol. Is what I believe to cover most of the reasonable reasons why someone would flee.   I'd also like to say I should of used more precise  langue. Instead of saying it had to be booze or drugs I should of said it was most likely a factor. I won't go into why I think drugs and booze most likely played a role. One because I think it is fairly logical and a little lengthy to type out.  I also feel the need to address what seems to me like an unwavering faith in our authorities abilities. It appears to me that you assume an investigation will bring all details of this incident to light. I find that sentiment flawed, despite its  endearing and commendable nature.  The reason for this is firstly, they may not find the persons responsible (I think they will). Secondly, however noble and beyond reproach our investigators happen to be; I struggle to see how they will be able to prove that drugs and alcohol were a factor.  Please feel free to point out the holes in my logic,great way to improve."
934894,davew3,2015-09-17 20:03:00,430,"There are a couple of things to factor that were not let out to the public.  Were they both moving?  Did both have lights on ? Was one parked and the other hit it? Did one not have their lights on ?  When it comes to the booze factor   2 beers,  that's all it takes to blow a machine.  If the person was just relaxing and made a mistake,  with as little as 2 drinks in them, it may be why they took off.   By booze I did not mean automatically smashed.  Just someone who thought they were having a god time.  I have not heard any follow up on this story yet."

G.mech's post did rub me the wrong way, for various reasons. Justifiably, I'm not sure.  Anyways, I will try to make my post a little more productive or at least more productive in the future."
