Council's recent decision to close the commercial fishery will also be discussed.  McLeod was asked if all his members are abiding by council's decision to shorten the commercial fishery season.  He said no figures have been released from the NFN's fishery department, but expects to receive an update at next week's meetings.  “I would assume we would have some issues. Just like every community there are some who believe they are above the law and Nipissing First Nation is no different than any other community.”  Fishing nets associated with the Nipissing First Nation commercial fishery were expected to be removed from Lake Nipissing as Aug. 22.  McLeod informed local fishermen that council was going to put a stop to gill netting to ensure the health and long-term sustainability of the walleye fishery.  “When council was voted into office they knew there was some tough decisions that had to be made.  The community was also aware,” he said, adding council is trying to come up with ways to lessen the burden.  Since the decision was made there has been some backlash.  “Some have said that we are attacking treaty rights by closing the commercial fishery,” McLeod said in a letter addressed to community members.  “Some feel that we are relinquishing our authority to the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry. Nothing could be further from the truth.”  The meetings are slated for Wednesday at 6:30 p.m. at the administration office in Garden Village and Thursday at 6:30 p.m. at Nbisiing Secondary School in Duchesnay.

So far Ohio has resisted all attempts by some groups to allow commercial netting of them again.  The money generated by sport fishing only for them is huge, and gets passed around to a lot more pockets."
