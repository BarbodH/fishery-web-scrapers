933830,MistyHollow,2015-09-12 11:03:00,21,"I know its early yet, but have been thinking of taking my 3 littles out a couple of times to target burbot this winter. For perch, walleye, lakers, and pike I have areas that are known. I have never purposely targeted  burbot before. Not looking for gps co ordinates, but can anyone point me in the right direction, or does anyone know of an outfitter targeting this species. Thanks, Dan"
934002,dhickey,2015-09-13 02:23:00,1038,It seems that they hit at nite . It's a hard long haul not suited to kids. Not  worth the effort/cost.  But good luck they are out there.
934009,Joeytier,2015-09-13 04:12:00,3990,"Long haul?  Just bait your holes with chunks of dead bait close to dark.  Typically they will come out just after the walleye bite has subsided right after dusk.  They are like Lakers, you'll catch them anywhere and everywhere and are very aggressive during the winter.  No idea where you live, but Nipissing and the Ottawa river are two definite productive bodies of water."
934011,adempsey,2015-09-13 05:28:00,1498,"Caught them on Lake Of Bays during the day targeting whitefish.   Non-stop action one day.    NIpissing is another lake where you can catch them.    I think Bernard too, but I can't seem to recall if we caught them there or not.   I can't say I know how to target them, they were always incidental catches.    Most people suggest fishing at dusk/night though using dead minnows or liver etc..."
934017,BowSlayer101,2015-09-13 10:33:00,296,"Lots of lakws in the hali area have them, split shot and hook with a minnow around 80 ft, (shallower towards spring) and wait, I get them anytime of day but in the evening its nonstop. At night just a glow jig and minnows, they usually hit and stay put until you start feeling them up."
934043,manitoubass2,2015-09-13 13:21:00,11391,"Jig and a worm or minnow deadsticked at night.  Be sure to jig it everyfew minutes because they are hard to detect.  If ya dont check your line for 20mins you might have had one on for 20 mins lol  Oh and they love to wrap your line around themselves a 1000 times, fun!  Ill only fish them in a heated hut. They will be anywhere the walleyes are in my experience"
934120,MistyHollow,2015-09-13 18:49:00,21,Thanks for the replies very much appreciated.  Does lake Simcoe give them up on the lake trout grounds? Wondering if a lake trout hut rental combined with night fishing may pan out. Thanks Dan
934145,Joeytier,2015-09-13 21:02:00,3990,"I remember seeing one caught while ice fishing perch off Willow Beach years ago, but I've never heard of people targeting them on simcoe."
934180,bow slayer,2015-09-14 00:11:00,1074,someone did a post on this site a couple years back fishing for them on Simcoe and they were killing them.....heres the thread http://ontariofishingcommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=41317&hl=%2Bsimcoe+%2Bling
934186,LostAnotherOne,2015-09-14 00:33:00,956,Caught my first burbot at Nippissing this past January.  Caught it at around 7pm which was dark at the time and was using a 1/4 oz white jig head with a medium size minnow on it.
