934590,206,2015-09-16 00:26:00,563,Not my video but might be worth the share.    PIKE ATTACKS!We recently had a chance to test the Lucky Bug Lures prototype Zombie Maxx 7 inch sectional bait. The following video is a brief sample of how effective it was during our latest trips to Ruffos Sportsmans Lodge and Tazin Lake Lodge 2011 Ltd.in Saskatchewan. We're really looking forward to trying a few more of the 50 variants that the company makes as the entire Zombie Maxx line has great swimming action and the pike loved them. We took 4 baits on our last trip - one was bitten off by a big pike and the other three are covered in teeth marks - the sign of a great trip made possible by a great lure!Fishing in Saskatchewan Tourism Saskatchewan Fishing Saskatchewan
