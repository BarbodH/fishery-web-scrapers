I was surprised to see that the shallow vegetation has mostly died back, sending the fish in search of water with more oxygen in it. We searched for awhile, trying flats close to deep water, rocky points, and transitions on the bottom. Finally found a pattern with all of the predator fish - LM, SM, Pike and Musky - cruising just below the surface over 20-30 FOW. Pattern of the day was a 5"" plastic swimbait on a jighead, loooong casts and slow steady retrieve. The hits were super subtle, just an increasing weight on the line. Surprisingly, they wouldn't hit a jerkbait. Had 8-10 really nice smallies in the 18-20"" range, a couple of decent LM, and a few midsized pike and musky.     "
933829,Joeytier,2015-09-12 10:21:00,3990,That's a productive outing...do you only fish from a yak?
933879,singingdog,2015-09-12 15:10:00,1047,"I occasionally wade, but 90% of the time it's from a Yak."

934001,OhioFisherman,2015-09-13 02:21:00,6623,"Sing, there should be some good weather left. I am just guessing but the shorter days probably affects water weed health and growth also?"
934016,singingdog,2015-09-13 10:10:00,1047,"Definitely some good weather left. IMHO, the best smallie fishing of the year is in October. The trick from now until the water gets really cold is finding them. One day they will be on the bottom in 40 FOW, the next they might be right against the bank rooting frogs or busting minnows."
