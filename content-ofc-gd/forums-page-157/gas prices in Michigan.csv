933777,OhioFisherman,2015-09-11 23:16:00,6623,"http://www.gasbuddy.com/  If you know where you are going it may help?   2.29 here, they have a 10 mile monopoly."
933782,dave524,2015-09-11 23:31:00,4508,"Buck a litre here, 4 litres is a splash over a US Gal.  $2.29 is darn near $3 Canuck. Still a saving."
933785,OhioFisherman,2015-09-11 23:39:00,6623,My son's buddy told me he saw it about 15 miles north of me for 1.97 a gallon this week. Fridays it seems like the prices magically go up for the weekend here.
933811,Raf,2015-09-12 02:20:00,3495,US gets hosed on diesel.. still cheaper than here though.  never could figure why diesel is more expensive that gas in the states.  0.97-0.99 / liter around me and regular is around 1.02-1.05 / liter. it'll reverse in the winter.
933813,Dutch,2015-09-12 02:28:00,831,The provincial and Federal gas tax adds a lot to the cost here in Ontario. It is buried in the cost per litre.  We are doubled taxed on gas here as we pay HST on the per litre taxes as well.
933815,joeybacala,2015-09-12 02:45:00,63,"And as good as $1.97 is, I was in South Carolina couple weeks back and price a gallon was $1.88. Cost me to fill up my minivan from almost empty $35.00. Absolutely insane. Typically even at $1.00 a litre it costs me $80."

Not all states are that way. Many have prices the same or a couple of pennies less then reg unleaded.

Raf, when I was young diesel was always cheaper than gas, then the demand grew! If you get better mileage from it? They charge more for it? LOL"
933837,Mister G,2015-09-12 12:44:00,1429,The real reason diesel is so much more now a days is because it's a much cleaner blend of fuel.
