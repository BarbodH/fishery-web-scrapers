These 'accidents' must happen more than I even imagined...it's like a 'hit and run' and the only thing you can do is make sure the victim of such a 'crime' is looked after first and foremost. I'm pissed..really pissed now. Again, sorry to hear that this happened, but thank you for sharing."
934122,grimsbylander,2015-09-13 18:53:00,3016,Let's plan an OFC weekend up there...we could choke that area off with so many boats they'll be portaging seadoos to get past your place.
934128,Lake Ranger,2015-09-13 19:26:00,70,"YES! I'm in! Let's do that, I would love it!"
934132,2 tone z71,2015-09-13 19:35:00,1311,It's like fast cars..you don't need common sense to purchase or operate one..I've had many sea doos over the yrs..yes there fun ...it's the booze ...drugs ..buddy's with no watercraft experience trying it out ...young kids ..if it's a seasoned boater pulling these stunts then yes they require a beating ...it's s shame so many ruin it for the others
934331,Lake Ranger,2015-09-14 19:57:00,70,"Well, I called the OPP and they told me they would not be able to deal with the situation, and that the Sturgeon Falls Police Department handles situations on small lakes in West Nipissing. So I called the Police and they said the OPP normally handle situations on lakes in West Nipissing. So, I'm confused as to what authorities are really in charge in handling a case like this. However, the Police Department said they would have an officer call me to discuss my complaint once one was assigned to the report. Guess I'm going to start building signs, rafts and potato guns."
934334,Sinker,2015-09-14 20:21:00,8692,I had a feeling that was the response you would get. You almost need someone to get hurt or killed before any authorities are willing to do anything about it. Brutal.  S.
934335,Dara,2015-09-14 20:37:00,3052,Next time they are out there call both police forces and report drunk drivers that actually have beer in hand on the watercraft..anonomously of course
934337,Gerritt,2015-09-14 21:10:00,6129,"Why not talk to the owner of the campground? That would be my first thought. Inform him of your concerns, inform him of the rights of other people enjoyment etc.... Don't expect the coppers to fight this battle for you....   Common courtesy can go a long way.  If that doesn't work..... Unleash hell.  G"

I couldn't believe it. Another cop told me it happens all the time. ou have to call 911 when something is happening and let 911 sort out who's job it is."
934396,adolson,2015-09-15 01:01:00,783,"That weekend the dipshits were out in full force on the lake I was fishing, too. We were in canoes and instead of staying on one side of the lake, they just HAD to come between us and the shore... The lake barely produced, so I just won't be going back. But if I owned property there, I'd be pissed.  Even worse is when I'm fishing a river and they decide to rip right in front of me a bunch of times. I tied on my heaviest Kastmaster and tried hitting the bullseye. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to catch anything but pike that day. :\ But at least the kid's dad saw what was happening and laid into him when he got back to shore on the far side."
934423,Muskieman,2015-09-15 02:52:00,2472,"Do you mind my asking which lake ? As I probably know it well, I may be of some help to you. Feel free to send me a PM ."
933847,Lake Ranger,2015-09-12 13:28:00,70,"Hi Everyone, it's been awhile since I've been here, but I'm hoping someone can help me out. I tried to enjoy a peaceful weekend at my camp in West Nipissing, but there was no chance in hell that was going to happen. For 25 years now I have owned 220 acres of property on two sides of a narrow lake (as narrow as the length of a pool in places) and  have never experienced an episode like what happened this past Labour Day weekend. A few years ago, a couple purchased a small piece of land close to mine with the intent to build a trailer park. Despite the community's and property owner's efforts to stop a commercial campsite from being developed, the Municipality granted them permission to do so. Long story short, a few years later and a ton of environmental and zoning wrong-doings, where the city just turned a blind eye, they got their campsite up and running. Things haven't been the same for property owners on this lake since, and one of the consequences now is that our taxes have skyrocketed because of this bogus development. Besides all the down-sides to this, our little lake is now a mecca for many inconsiderate campers from the adjacent 'private' trailer park. This weekend a few of them insisted on blazing around and around all weekend on their wave-runner, towing skiers and tubers right in front of my property where I like to swim across to my other side of the lake. The wake smashed my little fishing boat over and over onto the rocks and I was unable to go swimming until they took a short break. I went into the water and they returned, blasted by me, knowing damn well I was there but didn't give a crap, and carried on buzzing around and around recklessly and foolishly, hollering and carrying on like a bunch of idiots. Like I said, the lake is narrow. The shores are rock. There's rocks just beneath the water, and there is a marsh basin yards away which was also being inflicted with crashing waves with their continuous circling. The skiers flew off a few times. These people have no clue what this lake is like or what is beneath the surface nor do they care...and because it's secluded they can get away with anything they want. What the heck are they thinking? One day there's going to be a broken skull and a bunch of blood on my shore and I don't want to be liable. Is there anything I can do to prevent them from killing themselves or me? I just want to go there and find peace, not watch and hear a bunch of show-offs wrecking the lake, the habitat and my mind."
933852,Old Ironmaker,2015-09-12 13:44:00,8243,"Call the authorities. Simply put it is illegal to boat fast enough to cause a wake on any shoreline. That's what I would do, immediately not a week latter. Next time it happens have the OPP or whomever's responsible for the peace and safety in your jurisdictions number in hand. * OPP on your cell phone.  What they are doing is unsafe as you say and illegal."
933853,KraTToR,2015-09-12 13:47:00,506,"This seems to be a major problem all over now.  Although you need a boater's card very few personal watercraft operators follow the rules of right away, not to mention the other rules meant to keep everyone safe.  Last weekend I was leaving the big marina in Port Dover to go go out and do some fishing.  I was following a big cruiser (+40ft) and as we were exiting the ""no - wake"" area at the end of the breakwall some a$$hat in a 35' cruiser decided he was going to come into port on full plane, then dumping the throttle at the very last second.  Well this had little effect on the big boy in front of me but it sure tossed me around a bit and the operator looks at me with this big sh!t eatin' grin cuz he thinks he's so cool. Of course his kids are watching so now he's providing a good example for the generations to come.  Sigh..."
933854,Sinker,2015-09-12 13:50:00,8692,"Yep, you there is a specific speed limit when within a certain distance from shore. I can't remember the exact numbers, but it is there, and people do get charged with it. Seen it happen myself.  If you think its wreckless, they could also maybe be charged with wreckless operation. They're probably all drinking too.  Call the cops. I hate these kinds of idiots too. I don't mind people having fun, but I hate idiots.  S."
933857,Lake Ranger,2015-09-12 13:53:00,70,THANK YOU! I will get on this right away! I've beens so upset and really didn't know if there was anything I could do without being blown off as a disgruntled and bitchy NIMBY. I will call and email the MNR in North Bay as well in hopes that might stir some interest in the situation.
933861,Sinker,2015-09-12 14:02:00,8692,"Dont' count on the MNR doing anything......useless.  Call OPP marine unit, or SAVE team.  S."
933864,Old Ironmaker,2015-09-12 14:14:00,8243,"Krattor there seems to be a problem this summer everywhere but here on the north shore has been scary a few times for us. I don't know if you heard about the goof in Turkey Point on a yellow Sea Doo jet boat using swimmers as pillions to slalom around a few weekends this summer. I hope they got him.  Lake Ranger you will need to catch them in the act before the OPP come out has been my experience. Kind of reporting a speeder after the fact without a license plate number.. Take pictures of the numbers on the watercraft. We have your back, there is no need to have to live in fear for others safety as well as your own."
933867,Lake Ranger,2015-09-12 14:16:00,70,"I appreciate all the awesome advice from everyone and I'm sorry to hear of similar situations. It just wrecks it for everyone. There are so many responsible boaters and water vessel operators, and at the same time there's so many careless and disrespectful idiots out there. . I had no idea about this SAVE Team and will be making calls right away. I wonder if there is an online incident report forum for these types of situations... And talk about big crap eatin' grins...that's what I got all weekend long for hours on end....I finally grabbed my phone and filmed the idiots whooping and yippin' and yee-hawin' and the wake crashing ashore, so at least I have proof. I'm sure they're looking for themselves on You Tube now, thinking they'll be scouted for the next big stunt actors."
933870,SirCranksalot,2015-09-12 14:37:00,3291,When is open season??

933875,JoePa,2015-09-12 14:57:00,179,If the water is that narrow then ask the MNR to put - no wake - signs up at the spot - then if they continue to fly through that area they can be charged - you may even offer to pay for the signs - if the MNR won't do it then put your own signs up and see what happens
933883,woodenboater,2015-09-12 15:44:00,2277,gopro on your boat and record the crap out of them. then blast it out to various levels of gov't and their associated ministries

I could be wrong but i think it is 50 metres from shore has to be 10kmh or less. Nobody likes a clown i have a 12 footer that is routinely rocked by stupid people.   There is a 10km speed limit within 30 metres of shore.  However, if I remember correctly there is an exeption if the channel is less than 60 metres wide.  Regardless, boaters are responsible for any damage caused by their wake.  But, you have to be able to prove that they caused damage."
933972,Old Ironmaker,2015-09-12 23:08:00,8243,I took from the boater course that it was Zero wake on any shoreline. Posted or not. Erosion being the issue.
934039,Lake Ranger,2015-09-13 13:12:00,70,"Thanks for all the help. I know what I have to do now...and the kids having fun is great...I'm sure they don't even know what the deal is..it's the adults being irresponsible and wreckless, rude, inconsiderate and not giving a crap about anything..they're just wanting to 'stick-it' to me and the other property owners. They have a sense of entitlement I suppose, as they're paying for they're campsite spot. I wish I could post a photo here of the lake where it's happening, but I'm not sure how. Last year they had speed boat races up and down, doing figure eights all through this area and I wasn't able to go swimming once. Most of the people who own camps here don't even go on the lake anymore  and we/they are the ones that really 'care' about it's health and well-being."

By the time the cops went to their campsite they were long gone. My sister-in-law regained conciousness and was fine (other than usual concussion symptoms - headache, vomiting etc) so it was not pursued any further. Thankfully no long term effects for her, but without a doubt the scariest moment of our lives."
