934033,Gregoire,2015-09-13 12:45:00,1397,That is a nice thick fish. Thanks for sharing.
934038,Handlebarz,2015-09-13 13:11:00,3790,Awesome Fish John congrats your guys had some nice water to fish there dang looks rough for the little boat but we know the reward for fighting through it. Cheers Mike
934041,manitoubass2,2015-09-13 13:17:00,11391,Wicked fish!!!!  Congrats!!!
934045,Pigeontroller,2015-09-13 13:22:00,2793,"Really nice Muskie, I do question the decision to take a 12 footer out on Balsam in those conditions though!"
934048,Gallie,2015-09-13 13:32:00,1215,"Thanks again fellas! I agree it was a little rough out there and i should have stayed a little more north towards the trent canal where we were protected by the point to some extent, but it was crammed with boats for most of the morning. We kept it pretty close to shore as a precaution but neither of us had gotten real concerned about the conditions to that point."
934084,Rizzo,2015-09-13 16:28:00,4754,she's a beaut! I hope she dines on a lot of pike out there.
934085,captpierre,2015-09-13 16:32:00,2521,Nothin like having a Muskie lure STOP and not budge on a retrieve. Then feel that first heavy head shake. Like I say. Better than sex. ?
934095,Fisherpete,2015-09-13 16:50:00,1814,Beautiful fish Gallie! Huge head on that one. Well done!

933896,Gallie,2015-09-12 18:13:00,1215,"Went out to balsam today for a morning fish with my good buddy mark, the weather forecast looked bad for my 12 ft tin tippy but we went anyway and were greeted at the launch with some heavy wind and some big chop.  There were boats everywhere and i had wondered if there was a tourney of some sort going on cause these guys were literally fishing on top of each other and eventually on us too lol.  We had a limited range due to the chop so we did our best to get away from the boats and throw some casts mostly with inlines and shallow invaders, from 6:30 to 11:00 we didnt see a fish and only had a couple small taps to show for our efforts.  The waves had started getting out of hand so we were on one of our last drifts, i had gotten sick of the spinner not starting in the waves so i fired on a magnum bulldog and started firing for the hills, i was laughing and joking with mark that i had no idea how to fish this bait so i just started letting it sink a couple feet then a fairly straight retrieve.  Well, my 5th cast towards the deep edge and the bait stopped dead, i set the hook and it was game on. This battle was as much haul her to the boat as it was stay on my feet, after a couple minutes of intense battle mark slides the net under her.  When i saw it in the water it looked big but when i pulled it out of the net i was shocked, this fish went 48"" on the tape and i did not get a girth because i wanted to get her back in the drink asap. She was 2"" longer then my old pb but a heck of a lot heavier and thicker, she had an absolute massive head on her and im still shaking as i type this. I never thought i would catch this size of kawartha muskie so early into my balsam tenure but there she was.  Thank you for taking the time to read, heres some pics! Tightlines!  P.s. First couple pics were really blurry im hoping i can clean them up somehow.          "
933901,lew,2015-09-12 18:27:00,12766,Beauty for sure and congrats on the PB !!
933903,misfish,2015-09-12 18:33:00,29133,"Thats a dandy dude. Congrats.  I knew the winds were going to be crappola, so did venture out anywhere."
933909,leaf4,2015-09-12 18:52:00,2466,"Well done, beauty fish congratulations!"
933911,farsider,2015-09-12 18:55:00,456,"Awesome job!  Beauty fish!  Kudos on the release!  Cheers, Mark"
933913,Sinker,2015-09-12 18:58:00,8692,"Very nice!! I was going to cancel my musky trip after work, but maybe now I won't....hhmmmmmm   S."
933916,Gallie,2015-09-12 19:10:00,1215,"Thanks guys! Coming from a big musky guy like you lew that means a lot! I owe you one too sinker... Black and orange baby black and orange!  On the release i figured i would add the last pic, my last contact with this monster as she kicked out of my hands for good. "
933920,PBenson,2015-09-12 19:30:00,154,Congrats !
933923,spincast,2015-09-12 19:54:00,3279,congrats on the PB. Nice fish
933929,BillM,2015-09-12 21:03:00,17367,"Nice fish!  Those blurry pics are for the trash though, no saving those."
933935,Old Ironmaker,2015-09-12 21:11:00,8243,I bow to you my man. And from a 12 foot tinny. There should be a new class for record fish. Size of fish calculated by size and price of boat and equipment. You win Gallie!!!!!!
933947,porkpie,2015-09-12 21:40:00,2521,Nice tank!
933950,lew,2015-09-12 21:46:00,12766,Black and orange baby black and orange!   Probably the best color combo in your box.
933952,Raf,2015-09-12 21:51:00,3495,congrats on the fish and the beard  fire the cameraman
933960,Gallie,2015-09-12 22:31:00,1215,"Haha ol, my buddies and i have always joked that it aint the size of the boat its the size of the heart of the man. That little 12 holds probably half of my pbs. Thanks for the kind responses, i cant fire the cameraman cause hes the netman too lol!"
933992,captpierre,2015-09-13 01:02:00,2521,"Hell of a fish, Gallie. Great story. Congrats"
933993,OhioFisherman,2015-09-13 01:10:00,6623,Nice fish!
933994,moxie,2015-09-13 01:18:00,1566,Nice fish. Congrats on the PB as well. You might wanna burn that hoody though.
933995,mike rousseau,2015-09-13 01:22:00,4661,Nice fish  That's the fun in musky fishing... You never know... You next bite can be 5lbs or 40lbs... Lol
933996,singingdog,2015-09-13 01:34:00,1047,Nice fish!!! Congratulations!
933998,Smokercrafty,2015-09-13 01:39:00,227,"I commend you as well!!! I was out at Balsam today as well, and I must say, there were some nice swells in the west bay today!  Good for you, for staying on the dry side of the boat!!  We faired well, with a couple of decent walleye, musky, and pike. The musky surely wasn't as impressive as yours, but 36"" and acrobatic, made for a good fight."
933999,dhickey,2015-09-13 02:13:00,1038,Very nice  Just goes to show you never know....
934004,Nipfisher,2015-09-13 02:46:00,2449,Dam. Nice fish and a solid upgrade. Now I have to upgrade you. Gonna be tough.
934020,Hank Jr,2015-09-13 11:18:00,146,NIce fish it does look look a little rough out there . Thanks for the report
934025,bigcreekdad,2015-09-13 12:10:00,546,Nice fish....congrats! Might that have been an old male given the giant head? Truly a scary big head.
