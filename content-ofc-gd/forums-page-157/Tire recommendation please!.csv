Regards  Yes but dealers can recalibrate the PCM for different tire sizes in some cases... so weigh a 90.00 one time charge against saving 300.00 bucks on a smaller set of tires.  As for the tires and dates, while I wouldn't rush out and buy 10 yr old tires. anything in the 6 and under wouldn't cause me the least bit of concern if I looked at them first. Manufacturers are in the business to SELL tires and limit liability (ever tried to get a new tire under warranty LOL) so of course they would err on the side of extreme caution with respect to dates. The environment and how tires are stored probably would have a much bigger effect on the drying out than age."

934594,dhickey,2015-09-16 00:46:00,1038,Just a thought . Why would you feel that you need to buy 2 sets now? Winter is right around the corner. Buy a semi decent set of winters and you will have 6 months to find decent tires for the other 6  (warm) months of the year. It may mean you have to turn down a winter fishing trip but I can help you out on Simcoe to get your fix in. Now you will have two sets enough to last at least 5 years if you drive reasonably sain.  There is nothing like the feeling of running on winters through a snow/ice storm...

Snowflake rated lots of siping little road noise and not too spendy I have 40 k on mine and they still look new. You will sacrifice fuel mileage.

934636,Tybo,2015-09-16 14:19:00,1373,Mor'in Joe. Might  be worth going down on the rim size to something more common. In the long run it would be well worth it.
934640,bigbuck,2015-09-16 14:34:00,2449,"I run Sailun tires on my car and you know what, they are great. They ride well, handle well, are good in the wet and the snow. My tire guys recommend them highly. They sell everything as they are wholesalers and Sailun tires do not come back with problems like many of the name brands. I was a tough sell to go off brand. I always bought name brand tires but these have really impressed me. Hankook also makes a great tire. All depends on how much you want to spend. Goodyears I find wear quick, and not the performance tires. Michelins are good but like Goodyear, pricey. Spend a couple hours hitting some tire shops and see what they recommend. You may find a special purchase which translates to a great deal at one of them."

Currently the truck has Hankook tires, that were on it when I purchased the truck about a year ago. They have just about reached the end of their usable life and I am shopping around to replace them within the next month or so. I only do short trips in the winter and buying two sets of tires, all season and snows is just outta the budget right now. The tire size currently is 255/45R20 101V, which in all  honestly is flippin Swahili to me! The only brand of tire that I will not consider is Michelin. I have had two sets of Michelin tires crack on the sidewalls within a few years of owning them, I won't make that mistake again. It's my understanding that my tire size does limit what's available to me. Price point so far is in the $270 to $300 range, per tire, installed. Hoping to get some advice for you good folks and as always, looking to save some dough! Thanks in advance! HH"

However they wore quite quickly and are no longer produced. So this time I bought a set of Hercules Terra Trac's and they have been a really decent tire at a good price point so far. They are more durable than the Goodyear's I had and get almost as good winter traction.  Don't buy all season tires as they become ineffective in cold winter temps.  http://www.herculestire.com/know-your-tires/terra-trac-at-ii/#loaded

I have used the same installer for over 30 yrs and he has never steered me wrong. Lots of times I went in with recommendations from friends or even the internet and he was able to quickly show me the error of my thinking.  A good installer will see more tires come and go in a few months than most people will in 10 life times. They should also be up on what tire manufacturers are trying to live off a good reputation with a changed formula that isn't as good as it used to be.  Conversely they should also know, which problem tires have a new formula and are better than they used to be...  Tires are a wear item and many factors go into what causes it to happen quickly and what doesn't. So tire manufacturers are always playing with the recipe so what was a great tire last year might not be now..."
