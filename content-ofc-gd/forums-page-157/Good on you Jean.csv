So ya, if they get in power again, I can't imagine how we are 'screwed' like the fear mongering blue sports team likes to make us believe. Harper government is no longer the coalition they were when they first combined...nearly all (if not all) the true PC members have defected, leaving us with the current Alliance party run by Harper, which never really gained traction in their time because they were essentially republicans, and they were so out of touch that they were vocally anti-gay, anti-abortion, anti-immigration (government should have no say in that, and a true conservative government actually stays out of peoples personal lives!!). Vote Can-republican if you want, but this current government is way further right that what you believe Canadian conservatism is; its scare me way more than a deficit. Come to think of it, I'll personally be in deficit for 20 more years until my house and woodlot in the country, in a low-tax unorganized township are paid off. I'd love to have a real conservative government as an option. These guys just want power and to shut-up any opposition.  Really, I'm not afraid of a minority Harper government, but this majority crap has to go, even a majority liberal or NDP government scares me.. too much power in this hyper-partisan era."

You are so right Rod Caster  The fact that the religious right part of the Alliance is sticking by Harper again is a sign that they don't believe in anything really except holding on to power. The base elected him to quash a few things and he FAILED and rightly so but he still failed. Running deficits is supposed to be a big no no yet Harper still has conservatives defending his doing so.. The saddest part though is that as you say conservatives are supposed to be anti government and for freedom of rights. With Bill C-51 we are giving up so many hard earned freedoms  and increasing the governments ability to charge and detain people with no due process because Harper screams the BOOGEY man is out there.. Boogey man has always been out there and always will be in one form or another, but once you give up a freedom you NEVER get it back. Lastly should anybody really listen to the guy who hid in the closet, when the Boogey man was nearby, where was the tough action instead of talk then?"
934448,netminder,2015-09-15 13:06:00,514,"The fact that people are afraid of the boogey man or afraid that the boogey man is hiding amongst the refugees just goes to show how well the fear mongering works. There are plenty of people living in North America already who are well capable of being terrorists. Just because they have a brown skin complexion and read a slightly different version of a book written thousands of years ago does not mean they all want us dead. You must be the same people who complain about security at airports but have yourselves convinced it's for the best because some guy lit his socks on fire on an airplane a few years ago. But just wait until someone bombs the security line! All these knee jerk reactions and fear of the outside world is what is lowering our status as a nation. And Harper is letting it happen. And all because of ""the economy"" - but mostly to make sure his friends get paid.  And as for ""the deficit"" - I'd rather a government spends slightly more than what they have. What good does a surplus do? Prove that they can just take our money and do nothing with it? And who does the deficit get paid back to? The world bank? I hate to break it to you guys, but the world bank has been printing money since it was conceived. It's all based on nothing. Just some numbers some bankers made up a few decades ago."

After trying to find out the logic behind the way money is ""created"" these days all I can say is Bernie Madoff had NOTHING on the world bank...  I could never figure out a country like Canada could owe anybody anything unless it was somehow a scam, because the Bank of Canada's charter clearly stated at one time it's chief mandate was to create enough money for the government of Canada to do what was needed... without interest attached.  Somehow the World Bank changed all that not just for Canada but for almost all the western nations and ""debt"" has been piling up ever since. Since every dollar was now being created with interest attached to spur growth or some other Bull...  A lot of financial ""experts"" are saying the debts of most western nations are so massive they can NEVER be repaid. The interest payments though are a great financial reward for the insidious lot that came up with the scheme...."

This would reduce interest payments and in the long term allow the government to provide more services without increasing taxes.  The money is owed to many different people.  E.g. anyone who owns Canada Savings Bonds owns part of the $600 billion in debt.  Treasury bills are another form of debt used by the government.    p.s. If you like governments that spend more than they bring in then you should be happy with the past performance of Harper"

Unfortunately I know if I vote other than conservative in my riding my vote likely won't count.

The Italians were sent to Timmins (amongst others), Germans/Polish to Winnipeg...etc, I see nothing wrong with this. Traveling through small town Ontario I've seen signs for Family Doctors needed, if any of these refugees were Dr. in the homeland & can pass a placement test why not make it customary that they serve in these places for a allotted amount of time before they can move on, Toronto doesn't need anymore Dr. that are cab drivers or gas station attendants. At my workplace our shipper/receiver is a licence doctor in his home country & his credentials would be recognized in the UK but not here! Another thing that would have to be done without fail is follow ups to be sure they are here, remember a few years ago when crap hit the fan between Israel & Palestine & all of a sudden we had 10000 Palestinians that are Canadian looking for a lift home, I believe CBC investigated this and found 2/3 of those claimants live most of their time in Palestine Only briefly touching Canadian soil as to not cause a flag on their name."

German Chancellor Angela Merkel has stepped up to the plate, and the world looks upon the generosity of her country with admiration. The same goes for Norway, Sweden and Finland, which have welcomed refugees and do not erect roadblocks to taking them in. Instead they get rid of roadblocks. But not Mr. Harper. He has shamed Canada in the eyes of Canadians and of the international community. In my travels around the globe, I am regularly asked: What has happened to Canada? What has happened to the advanced, peace-seeking, progressive country Canada once was? What has happened to the country that was a model for peace and stability in a tumultuous world? These questions evoke great sadness in me. I am sad to see that in fewer than 10 years, the Harper government has tarnished almost 60 years of Canada’s reputation as a builder of peace and progress. During all these years, government leaders, whether Liberal or Progressive Conservative, have sought to understand, engage and influence their international peers, including those with whom they disagreed. They did not try to embarrass or give other countries lessons in good behaviour. Rather, they patiently sought to convince others of the universal values that make our global community a better and safer place to live. Of course, peaceful dialogue does not always work. War is sometimes unavoidable. But solutions should come from the world community working together – not from a handful of countries acting outside international institutions to which they belong.""

933932,ecmilley,2015-09-12 21:05:00,2163,"truth be told we send troops, weapons supplies and training to these people to defend protect and stand up for there own countrys, to run away and turn a blind eye to these aggresions is nothing more than a act of cowardice, true freedom is won by fighting if needed diplomacy when possible. jean and the rest of the liberals are a bunch of pantloads"
933936,woodenboater,2015-09-12 21:13:00,2277,"Imo, IS will be very near impossible to defeat because it's not modelled on traditional armies/warfare (iow, rats and roaches will never be eradicated). there's also no snakehead to lop off. That they can blend in is a guarantee but still no reason to abandon refugees from Syria. Indeed, most Syrian refugees aren't the result of IS but the long and nasty civil war brought on by Assad. IS jumped into the fray when the West failed to support the FSA. but it's more complicated than that unfortunately...  We need a new paradigm to fight groups like IS and Al Qaeda (who now look tame by comparison)."
933939,lew,2015-09-12 21:15:00,12766,I was listening to a radio talk show last week about the refugee crisis and those complaining that Canada isn't doing her fair share.  The host said Canada has one half of one percent of the worlds population yet we accept 10% of the worlds refugees.  No idea if those numbers are correct but if they are I'd say we're most certainly doing our fair share.
933943,Old Ironmaker,2015-09-12 21:23:00,8243,Harper is not abandoning Syrian refugees. He wants to be sure we have done our due diligence before allowing terrorists refuge along with those that are legitimate. That I applaud.  In order to defeat a faceless 21st Century enemy we need to do it covertly. Tanks rolling across deserts and Drones will not accomplish that.
933953,woodenboater,2015-09-12 21:59:00,2277, In order to defeat a faceless 21st Century enemy we need to do it covertly.  yup. black ops to put fear and paranoia in their hearts and minds.
933954,Canuck2fan,2015-09-12 22:00:00,1444,"I don't think there is any question that Canada has a solid history of helping refugees when needed.  As for our current ""fight"" with ISIS, we supposedly fly 2% of the support missions or are they combat missions. That sounds great but what are the air missions accomplishing? While a ground war has NEVER been won without air superiority, NO war has ever been won from the air... So who are the troops on the ground we are supporting in the air war, what is holding them back for crushing ISIS?  As mentioned is ISIS something that can be defeated in the traditional sense of a war? Vietnam and other conflicts have proven it is pretty hard to beat a group that when they meet an overwhelming force they just chuck their guns and blend into country side until the overwhelming force leaves...  If ISIS were somehow stopped all together who or what takes over where they are now?  When the richest country in the region with the same religious majority as the majority of refugees won't take any..... umm what is that we don't understand about the issue?  The other thing is if it is a genuine refugee disaster in Syria why are there some reports showing that 72 percent of the refugees are men of fighting age, 15 percent are children and only 13 are women?  http://www.thepoliticalinsider.com/heres-one-fact-dismantles-syrian-refugee-myth/#ixzz3lGvnHuEl"

Hell, even our neighbour to the south are in trouble.  I say close our boarders NOW.   Canada can not save the world. We are in debt, yet we spend/send, millions of dollars to save people from other countries.  Dose that make sence to you all ?????????????"

933988,ketchenany,2015-09-13 00:22:00,3229,"My grandfather (1903) was allowed to come and ""work"" and nothing else, don't want to work get out. My parents in the early 60s were sponsored and came to ""work"" NO benefits allowed. They made it for many years on their own with two kids. WE followed their example and we paid our dues for 55 years. Contributed and never collected. YET when I retire my benefits will be less than a person claiming to be a refugee! Am I wrong on this? In my business there is NO Goverment pension plan and I have looked after myself. BUT why do we take care of others before the people who have paid in to it like me or my parents for over 50 years.  Canada keeps criminals better off than the people that pay taxes.  just listen to the three stooges jumping on the bandwagon looking for votes because of the refugee situation worldwide.  I spend less than I earn, why can't the government do the same?"
933989,porkpie,2015-09-13 00:23:00,2521,"We aren't getting out of the Middle East no matter who is in power.  They can rant and rail all they want while trying to get elected.  When the rubber meets the road, we will stick with big brother, if we want to keep their shield and sword handy.  This country has stayed strong and free for a long time under the shadow of our friends and cousins in the US. We are a very attractive place, and will walk lockstep with US interests to keep it that way.  As for refugee's??  We have always extended a hand, and I don't see any virtue in opening the floodgates without figuring out just who your allowing in.  We have a long history of helping others, sometimes you have to watch out for your own first."
