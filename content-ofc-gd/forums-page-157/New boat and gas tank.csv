935092,jameshandz,2015-09-18 20:26:00,31,So I use to have a 7.5 merc on a tin boat with a 25 l tank . I just upgraded to a little bow rider with a 70hp johnson . Now I wanna use my old tank from my tin boat as a back up but they have different fittings . Can I just take the merc fitting off the actuall tank and screw in a johnson fitting ? Any help would be great .
935093,craigdritchie,2015-09-18 20:30:00,1586,Don't take the fitting off the tank. Use an adapter hose that has a Merc connection at one end and Johnson at the other.  Scepter Canada sells a wide range of fuel line fittings and fuel line adapters. Most marine stores have them.
