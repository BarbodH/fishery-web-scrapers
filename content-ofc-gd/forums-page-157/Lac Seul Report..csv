Roloff had to stay home because of this but i'm sure it won't be long before they are introduced and become friends.  Fishing was good and so was Kris's reaction to catching big walleye, he has caught them before but the first fish landed of the day was his biggest by a long way and his reaction to it was special in itself….Lac Seul is a MAGICAL place.  Fish were at 17' - 25' FOW, jigs and minnows vertically jigged. Fish would turn on and off like someone flicked a switch so we moved around a bit but our original spot was the most productive all morning.                           "
