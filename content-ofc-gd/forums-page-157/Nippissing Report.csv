It wasn't me fishing but it was my bro in law and his family up at a cottage rental with pontoon rental on Cache Bay. He sent me the pics everyday and man was I jealous.  Mostly two of them fishing but the other two joined in on occasion and landed a few too. In total it was 57 pike (34 for him) and a few LMB, SMB and a white bass. At first I thought it was a hybrid striper but upon closer look, I think it's a big white bass.     Here are some of the bigger fish from their haul:                                   Notice the spoon on this one. He's a big Pats fan:    "
