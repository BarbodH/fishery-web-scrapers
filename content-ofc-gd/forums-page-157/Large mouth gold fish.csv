934578,fishindevil,2015-09-15 23:50:00,6254,Ya it looks pretty cool !!! Seen it on Facebook and they got a biologist to explain it too ....I'm suprised it didn't get eaten when it was small not good to be sticking out of the crowd that's for sure   Lol
934585,dhickey,2015-09-16 00:15:00,1038,A gold largemouth kinda makes you wonder what's going on.  Hmmm Just thinking out loud here Would using old tire's be a safe way to aid natural reproduction in places that have declining populations due to predation or over fishing?
