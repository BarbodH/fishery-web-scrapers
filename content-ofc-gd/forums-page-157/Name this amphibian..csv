933519,Gerritt,2015-09-10 14:26:00,6129,Found this little fella hidden inside my satellite dish...  Any idea as to what species of toad this is?    G
933521,dave524,2015-09-10 14:28:00,4508,"not a toad , it's a tree frog"
933523,Brettiop,2015-09-10 14:32:00,279,"Yupp, that's a gray tree frog, I've seen many in the area and used to be a favorite of mine to find when i was a little kid  Sometimes they get a little  green to them, pretty cool animals"
933525,Gerritt,2015-09-10 14:42:00,6129,"So that's the little sucker keeping me up at night! Thanks fellas, luckily he found another place to hide out  G"
933526,KraTToR,2015-09-10 14:47:00,506,Yes they make quite the racket.  I have several in and around my back yard.  My favorite frog for sure..
933538,adolson,2015-09-10 15:41:00,783,I think you should name him Jeffery.
933546,BillM,2015-09-10 15:59:00,17367,"Gerritt, I think it might be an Atlantic."
933606,misfish,2015-09-10 20:59:00,29133,LMAO Some have to remember this oldie.      
933733,jimmer,2015-09-11 19:34:00,2730,I have also been seeing a lot of them this year. Sometimes in the strangest places.
933734,Thrilla,2015-09-11 19:51:00,164,"One of those pissed in my 3 year olds eye a couple months ago. He said he could't see/eyes were red and foaming from the mouth, my wife called poison control and they said they will give those effects but harmless anyways, its more a defence for animals that try to eat them, they pee in there mouth get a nasty taste and start foaming. Notice dogs only try it once haha  Seems there are some deadly ones in South america. Kid still grabs every toad/frog he sees"
933800,FloatnFly,2015-09-12 01:30:00,1640,that would be a fish bait frog.........j/k can't use tree frogs as bait
934242,crappieperchhunter,2015-09-14 09:44:00,2582, Kid still grabs every toad/frog he sees Thx for the morning laugh. Boys will always be boys.  And thx Brian for the singing frog... put a grin on my face.  Nice picture too G. Thx for sharing.  I have never seen one in person myself....but I'll keep looking.

The mouth foam can be used as shampoo.  Totally just made that up, hopefully it sounded cool."
