932526,Big Cliff,2015-09-03 19:00:00,6899,"https://www.rv.net/forum/index.cfm/fuseaction/listings/forum/65.cfm Similar to many other sites lots of ads, not much user feed back unless I'm missing something."
932528,Big Cliff,2015-09-03 19:09:00,6899,"http://www.rvcanada.com And again, (unless I'm missing something) you jump through the hoops to register and end up registered to RVUSA.Com  Thanks for trying my friend but either I'm stupid (it's been known to happen) or there are way too many people out there trying to gather your personal information."
932545,davew3,2015-09-03 20:12:00,430,Cliff explore this site
932557,Big Cliff,2015-09-03 20:32:00,6899," Cliff explore this site  Thank you but again, unless I am missing something that is also a commercial site rather than a form. I am trying to find a site where I can talk to other RVrs, ask questions, get some ideas and help. Everything I found on there was about finding dealers and camp grounds. I am really trying to find a site similar to OFC but for RVs. (I know, I know, it's going to be one heck of a tough challange LOL)"
