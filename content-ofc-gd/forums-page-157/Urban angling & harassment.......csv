Once I had a guy ( who I have had run ins with before )screaming at me and  we just acted like we didn't even see or hear him and just kept fishing. He was only ten feet away and his blood was boiling. pretty funny. I also have no problem telling people to take a hike either. Although I have never had to do this, I am prepared. My neighbor is the chief of the T.O. marine unit and I got confirmation from him that they cant kick you out. ( access from a boat )"
