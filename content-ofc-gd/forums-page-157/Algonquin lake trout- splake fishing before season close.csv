Will be there the last weekend of September right before their season closes. Looking to fish for lake trout or splake, but don't have a boat. Will they be within casting distance by then? I can rent a canoe if that is what takes.  Also wondering what depths I should be fishing at. I know Lakers tend to stay deep but what about splake? Also which lakes gives me the best chance at hooking into them? I was thinking Opeongo lake since I can get a canoe from the outfitters on the lake. I will be fishing for a few hours so would like to have the best chance at catching these beautiful fish.  Any advice would be appreciated"
934424,Dozer,2015-09-15 03:05:00,896,Opeongo on a canoe can be dangerous.  The fish are usually shallow by then.  2 weeks ago the splake were in 15 ft. adjacent deep water ( that was after the cold spell we had )

Although, I think we may have also gone later than September as well.  I believe the season is open until the end of November for Splake."
