934505,dave524,2015-09-15 17:57:00,4508,"I wonder about nutrient rich waste water from the facility as well as antibiotics and growth hormones in the raising of these fish. Sustainable maybe, but at what cost ? Could be the ecological mess that these large scale pork factories are. They use the word ""Sustainable "" and people will think it means "" Organic "" which I fear it is not."

Organic is much more of a buzzword these days. i.e. ""organic"" chemicals that are actually more toxic and harmful than their non-organic counterpart."
