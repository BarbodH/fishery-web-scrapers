The duck blinds out in the lake have been in the same location every fall since I have been here (just over 10 years) I am sure those hunters are not going to take too kindly to someone harvesting their decoys along with the rice.  OOPS....SORRY DIDN'T SEE THEM, WON'T CUT IT."

933678,buckhorn250,2015-09-11 10:34:00,85,"Its a pretty sad situation. To be clear any resident of Canada has the right to harvest wild plants within the restrictions provided...protected plants, trees, shrubs, personal property.  The issue here is not the harvesting which is an absolute right....its the planting and seeding of the rice. Equivalent to one of use trying to plant a cash crop like corn in a public park. The treaty, permit and rights of this individual do not cover seeding. Its not his right to determine how much rice there should be in these lakes.  Also, another interesting angle were looking at is that he is marketing his product as ""Wild Rice""...there is nothing wild about it...its a planted cash crop. I have a number of friends and colleges in the restaurant business in Toronto who have been approached and have purchased this product. They were shocked to hear the background (they advertise it as ""wild rice"") and there is a up swelling starting.  Kill the market demand...kill the product.  Also to be clear this is one guy...its a shame that he is hiding behind his heritage and creating a negative association...its an individual not a group that has created this issue."

933689,AKRISONER,2015-09-11 12:59:00,5558,"simple solution using critical mass  every person that is Ticked off about this situation, should go out and collect 1lb of rice, or at least make an effort to destroy his crops...  if everyone gangs up on it, the problem is solved. The guy can say you are destroying his crops, but whos crops are they if they are planted on water...What is the guy going to do, press charges against 1000 people?  If this guy tried to do this on my bay, id be out there dragging a sickle a couple hours a day.  I personally think this guys an idiot...he knows bloody well what hes doing and hes using his status as a shield of sorts, its pretty pathetic.  Theres a proper way to go about things in order to avoid problems and hes simply making noise just to make noise. Ill also point out that an absolutely huge section of upper buckhorn and curve lake is beside the reserve...these areas are mostly barren of any structures or peoples cottages. If the guy wanted to plant rice in there, people would maybe still upset but his argument would be way more valid.  Instead this dink goes and plants rice in south pigeon infront of everyones cottages.  This reminds me of the story of when some status guys tried to say that it was their right to string a gill net across byng inlet during the walleye run...lets just say a few anchors were towed and (rumour has it some shots were fired) but that never happened again.  I feel bad for the native guys that try make an honest living, this kind of garbage just makes a lot of noise and I am sure makes it worse off for everyone."
933696,Sterling,2015-09-11 13:52:00,477,It should be highly illegal to plant ANYTHING in a lake unless it's to restore destroyed environments.  Planting/seeding/introducing any organism can have a profound and permanent effect on an ecosystem. Very disappointing.
933698,Sinker,2015-09-11 14:08:00,8692,It is illegal
933706,jimmer,2015-09-11 15:47:00,2730,I was going to say that I have always understood that it is illegal to harvest wild rice. (non-native) http://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/90w07
933763,buckhorn250,2015-09-11 21:45:00,85,Yes Jimmer I believe your correct it is illegal for me to harvest wild rice. I'm willing to take it to the courts...the rice I remove is not wild...it has been seeded and intentionally planted and does not meet the criteria outlined by the statute.
933814,Dutch,2015-09-12 02:42:00,831,"The way I understand it is Whetung has two licences to harvest - one commercial (he uses an airboat), the other traditional native (using a canoe).  I think Pigeon is his commercial crop and Upper Chemong the traditional.  I dont see how he can plant and harvest commercially using his treaty rights as a backfall.  Homeowners and cottagers need to jump through permit hoops to change any part of their shoreline, but altering the lake for commercial gain goes unabated.  He sells the rice at the local farmers market. Anyone up for a protest....lol."
933819,Freshtrax,2015-09-12 03:15:00,2215,Anyone got a 50 gallon drum of roundup kicking around???.  Just kidding of course .
933825,fishindevil,2015-09-12 08:55:00,6254,Ya the traditional way way of his ancestors with an airboat and all the mechanical equiptment just like they used to use !!!  There is video of h doing his harvesting taken by cottagers not sure if it's on YouTube but it's there somewhere makes quite the mess as well
933010,buckhorn250,2015-09-07 16:12:00,85,"Looking for some idea of the level of awareness of the wild rice issue on the tri-lakes. I am supportive of the harvesting of wild rice, however I learned this year that the rice that has taken over our bay is not natural and is being planted by an individual from Curve lake who openly admits that he is planting seed. Ive done a bit of research and sounds like Pigeon is even worse. The rice is being sold commercially under the brand Black Duck. Again the individual has a license to commercially harvest rice, but the planting of rice is clearly illegal.  As I indicated in the title its not really a fishing discussion but I have definitely seen the negative impact to the bass fishing over the last several years.  Any way looking to see what others think"
933017,Gallie,2015-09-07 16:53:00,1215,If hes planting rice illegally he should be stopped or charged to prevent further damage to the lake.

933104,Dutch,2015-09-08 00:54:00,831,"A couple of things I dont understand about this. Whether Whetung is allowed to plant intentionally and and if selling the rice commercially are within his treaty rights.  I read an article recently in the local paper that said he was going to be reintroducing wild rice to Rice lake.  Why would he choose Rice Lake - probably due to the huge fishing tourism that people will be up in arms about losing that business.  If he was truly in this to be in the wild rice business, why wouldnt he plant Buckhorn or Chemong for obvious reasons. He wants Rice Lake due to the impact it would have on the fishing tourism and will get more attention from the government.  Just like anything dealing with Native Canadians this will take many years to resolve. By that time South Pigeon will be choked from the dog leg at the river all the way to the passage leading to Gannons narrows. Who knows about Rice Lake.  Hes looking for a payout IMO, otherwise why would he be thinking about planting Rice Lake?"
933105,Sinker,2015-09-08 01:08:00,8692,"Historically, rice lake was a harvested area for wild rice. They dont call it rice lake for nothing.  I have to go for a boat ride.
