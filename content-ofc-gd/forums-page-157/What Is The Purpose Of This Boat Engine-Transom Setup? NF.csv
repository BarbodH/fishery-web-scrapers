934784,alexmedic,2015-09-17 02:30:00,186,Saw this today while at a stop light.  Any ideas what this configuration would be for?   
934785,SBCregal,2015-09-17 02:33:00,688,looks like maybe it was an inboard/outboard setup originally and maybe it needed replacing.  i'd think it's cheaper to toss an outboard on back than rebuild a motor or drive/lower unit.
934788,DRIFTER_016,2015-09-17 02:53:00,10439,Extended transoms make the boat handle better by making it perform like a longer boat by setting the motor further back.
934790,manitoubass2,2015-09-17 03:03:00,11391,Id love to hit a dead head with that setup up
934791,Old Ironmaker,2015-09-17 03:04:00,8243,Former I/O. He probably blew the I/O and had access to a free or near free outboard. He gained a lot of room too.
934794,Freshtrax,2015-09-17 03:48:00,2215,I'd love to have a bracket and a outboard over my I/o any day
934797,spincast,2015-09-17 09:35:00,3279,. I wonder how water tight that cable assembly is? That is a mod for sure - look at the two capped ports in the middle of the extension. ot sure I would want to prime that engine in 5 foot swells

934801,Big Cliff,2015-09-17 11:06:00,6899,"I'm pretty sure we saw that boat out on Sturgeon Lake the other day, both Sue and I were wondering about that setup. The former I/O makes sense."
934812,dave524,2015-09-17 12:07:00,4508,"Set back brackets ...very common ...some manufactures are moulding them right into there fibreglass moulds ..lot of custom all welded aluminum come with these ...very safe big water boat ,full transom , like Dave said added performance ,lots of room  Yep, getting more common every year. Last few years even the Starcraft Islanders has this set up on the outboard model.  Edit : those old enough might remember the OMC Sea Drive"
934813,Gerritt,2015-09-17 12:07:00,6129,A lot of higher end aluminum boats are Setup like this
934814,kickingfrog,2015-09-17 12:11:00,8333,It also looks like a smallish engine for the boat. Although without seeing all of the boat can't say for sure.
934817,Rizzo,2015-09-17 12:34:00,4754,somebody gave them a shortshaft outboard rather than long and they found a way to use it
934821,hirk,2015-09-17 12:48:00,571,"Its an i/o conversion, that transom wasnt made for an outboard."
934830,OhioFisherman,2015-09-17 13:34:00,6623,"Extended transoms make the boat handle better by making it perform like a longer boat by setting the motor further back. Yes, if you google Sea Star boats images they have a few of them on there with that type of setup."
934836,Tybo,2015-09-17 13:50:00,1373,A full transom set-up. Walk to the back of boat with out obstructions. More room for trolling.
934837,Gerritt,2015-09-17 13:59:00,6129,"I remember seeing an all aluminum, welded Boat at one of the Nipissing trips one year..... It was one hell of a boat.... Setup just like this boat is  I can't remember who owned it though..... But man was it a sweet machine. I think it was a Stanley if I remember right...  G"
934856,Mister G,2015-09-17 15:44:00,1429,It's too extended the total length of the boat so you can't fit it in your garage and thus must rent winter storage from them. . . . .
934927,craigdritchie,2015-09-17 23:32:00,1586,"Most likely the owner replaced an I/O with an outboard. Many advantages to this - outboards generally weigh much less than an I/O of equal power, so you get a better power/weight ratio ... modern outboards give better fuel economy than I/Os ...  you can tilt the outboard completely out of the water to keep crud , zebra mussels and (in salt water) barnacles out of it ... and moving the prop aft of the transom gives it more leverage, so you have greater speed and much better handling.  Brackets aren't just for repowering though, you do see them more and more on new boats - especially big salt water rigs.  Disadvantages to brackets are that they can be awkward when using downriggers, and they require the transom to be reinforced, since you're hanging the engine's full weight out on the end of it. If you use one, you'll probably have to replace your prop as well (pitch will be off) and the engine height is critical. Most brackets are installed with jack plates as a result.  Armstrong are probably the biggest bracket maker out there. You can find more info on their website."
934956,tb4me,2015-09-18 02:50:00,3295,Actually I really want one of these boats..This would be my boat of choicehttp://www.kingfisherboats.com/lake-sport/2025-freedom-hht/http://www.kingfisherboats.com/lake-sport-2/
934958,irishfield,2015-09-18 03:00:00,26272,"Was just going to say that's how they build the Kingfisher. Temagami Marine has a few in the showroom right now, although I'm not overly keen on the look of the hull to side panel welds."
934963,manitoubass2,2015-09-18 04:16:00,11391,One of my best friends has the 1925 classic and its one heck of a boat!  Not related to the op but kingfisher makes really really nice boats
