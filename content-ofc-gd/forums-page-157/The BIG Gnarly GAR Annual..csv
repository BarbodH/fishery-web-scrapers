933133,gordy28,2015-09-08 11:15:00,638,As always great report. Reminds me of what fishing is about spening time with friends and family Photos of your 3 ladies on the deck are priceless.

933168,Headhunter,2015-09-08 16:59:00,5703,"Thanks for the great read Drew! Such a cool looking fish! It's my understanding that Gar is poisonous and not in any way eatable. I also understand that historically, first nations people used their scales as arrow heads. Can't remember where I learned all that, it just sticks in my head. HH"

934655,Moosebunk,2015-09-16 15:45:00,3970,"In last night from a real quick trip on and off the Nipigon and now catching up during a morning veg.  As always great report.Reminds me of what fishing is about spening time with friends and familyPhotos of your 3 ladies on the deck are priceless.  Thanks Gordy!  Your absolutely right, those pics are priceless to a gar and fish-nut like me.  This fall it's planned they all get some more time out.  It's my understanding that Gar is poisonous and not in any way eatable. I also understand that historically, first nations people used their scales as arrow heads. Can't remember where I learned all that, it just sticks in my head.   The non edible part Joe I've heard the same.  Believe that their eggs are toxic to other fish too.  Millions of years of adaptation perhaps?   But it'd be an interesting history to know exactly what uses the fish did have to our First Nations... Those scales could slice a few heads off. lol.  WHAT A BEAUTIFUL FAMILY YOU HAVE DUDE.  Think so bud!  Love me my girls.   Thanks all."
