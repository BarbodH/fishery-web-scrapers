I have been to mountsberg but looking for other places.  Also wondering if pike move in closer to the river mouths at this time of the year or move out deep into the lake? I fish port credit and bronte pier frequently so would be nice to know if they hang out there.  PM me if you wish to share a location.  Thanks"
934735,DRIFTER_016,2015-09-16 23:43:00,10439,Have caught some good ones S of the QEW bridge on the Credit in my yoot!!! Above the rowing club. Usually in the spring though. Never tried @ this time of year as I was usually chucking hardware off the pier for sammins and troots.
934943,huzzsaba,2015-09-18 00:55:00,884,thanks. I know the spot you are talking about but the closest I was able to get was about 20 feet from the railway bridge across the rowing school. didnt get any bites although they may be on the other side of the railway bridge.  I will keep trying since I know I have seen a pike or two at the river mouth a month or two ago.
