My Mom was a kid when Pearl Harbor was attacked and she said it was the exact feeling on 9/11. We must never forget the sacrifices of the fallen that day or any day in fact. These people run into a burning building not from it. Those are real heroes in life, not the ones on screen or on the field. Those going into work that lost their lives will not be forgotten as well.  Rest in peace."
