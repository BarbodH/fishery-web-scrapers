933694,bobowski,2015-09-11 13:37:00,360,"Hey guys, Im planning a trip to nipissing this year for our annual boys trip. I'm thinking about booking with winterwalleye.com ice bungalows. They seem like a new outfitter. Has anyone ever booked with these guys before and if so how was your experience? Thanks"
933695,Sterling,2015-09-11 13:49:00,477,"Haven't been with that outfit yet, but their bungalows look nice.  Whatever you don't get pizza in Callander (I live there). The 2 worst pizza places in the world just so happen to be located right in Callander.  Unless you like soggy bread with Tomato paste on it. And cheap, cheap cheese. And bologna slices."
933711,Rod Caster,2015-09-11 16:46:00,5784,"I actually never heard of them, but if they are new I'd assume their equipment should be in good condition and clean.  Hahaha. I guess I'm not a pizza connoisseur then. Then again, I also love 2-4-1 pizza, and balogna"
933721,bow slayer,2015-09-11 17:39:00,1074,"My son and I rented a hut off him for a day about 2 years ago. Nice guy, i believe his name was Werner. The huts were very nice and very clean.He had them right in Callander Bay. We went late in the season,last week of it if I remember correctly. Fishing was okay we caught a couple small walleyes,about a dozen keeper perch along with several dinks,4-5 ciscoes and 2 hammer handles from about 7am-530pm. I would assume the fishing is much better earlier in the season in the bay.  i thought the pizza was okay,we went in to pick one up for lunch."
933732,jimmer,2015-09-11 19:29:00,2730,You do realize that you can't keep any eating size walleye on Nipissing? Enjoy if you're all catch and release though!
933807,Joeytier,2015-09-12 01:50:00,3990,"Callander not so much, but the vast majority of the main basin of Nipissing is loaded with schools of massive, delicious perch, plus pike, herring, whitefish, burbot etc.  It's pretty uncommon for me to leave the nip in the winter without a nice pile of fish for the pan!"
934006,Nipfisher,2015-09-13 03:12:00,2449,"Hey Sterling, try the Perogie Pizza from LuLu's (Calander Tavern). Also La Piazza is pretty good.  Bob iwaki, let me know when you guys come up and I will try my best to meet up with you on the sled."
934018,Roy,2015-09-13 10:44:00,13728,"You could also try Rob Hyatt Lake Nipissing Ice Bungalows 374 Lighthouse Road | Callander, Ontario | P0H 1H0 Phone: 705.752.1727 |  Fax: 705.752.5422  We've used his services a few times in the past and have no problem recommending him.

934026,bigcreekdad,2015-09-13 12:11:00,546,"Go AWAY!! At least for a couple months.  I'm heading to West Arm tomorrow, and even the title of your post put me in a bad mood.  "
