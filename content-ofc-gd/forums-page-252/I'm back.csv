Just need to find all the stuff for the Niagara Outdoor Show a week from now, Mar. 9th. ""Granny"" will show up next week to set things right around this place. I even have a man cave. Got to admit that I am blessed with all the good folk that turned up to help move. Lord knows I just could not physically manage it."

839265,bigugli,2014-03-02 04:56:00,6138,"Big change from Grimsby to Thorold, what brought that on? Thorold is the Bride's hometown. Central to most of my friends, and the fishing in the region  House in Thorold worked out to be more affordable for the 3 of us. We had outgrown the place in Grimsby, and it was poorly maintained. Especially the elevators. Every week you risked get stuck in one, or both had failed and you were doing 4 floors of stairs. Very hard for Judy, tough on me on my bad days."

839318,crappieperchhunter,2014-03-02 18:18:00,2582,Congrats on the move Bruce. I know you will enjoy the space and the yard more then being in an apartment.
839335,Big Cliff,2014-03-02 20:49:00,6899,"Bruce, that's wonderful news, I am really happy for you but I wish I had known you were moving, I can't lift a lot anymore but I'd have been happy to help driving or wharever!"
839342,Roy,2014-03-02 22:02:00,13728,Congrats Bruce. I'm sure it'll be much easier for you and your sweetie. I'm happy for you.
839362,bigugli,2014-03-03 00:12:00,6138,"Thanks guys. We're pretty happy about the choices we've made. However , I don't know what possessed me to put wife and son together under the same roof once again. Worse than a pair of sibs trying to get the better of the other.    Hard to find another adult in the house  . At least we're having fun."
