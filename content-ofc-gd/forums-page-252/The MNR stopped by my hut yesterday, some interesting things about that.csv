839552,Moosebunk,2014-03-03 23:56:00,3970,"Between 2006 to 2009 while fishing Kesagami Lake during the winter for pike and walleye, I was checked by the OMNR four times over four years, but one year twice.  From 2009 ti'll now, I have been checked by the OMNR on the Rideau Lakes once.  All times they have been excellent.    Or they read the forums like everyone else does   Second or third check on Kesagami, the Officer read aloud my name off the card then said, ""so you're Moosebunk?""  To which I replied, ""yes, did you get that off the card?""  ""He then stated, ""Enjoy reading your posts on OFC and recognized your parka.""  He wasn't the only one.  Before long planes out of Cochrane several times looked for me on the ice and pretty well landed on my head.  A 30km long lake and they'd fish on top of me.  But that's another story... and a lesson learned as well.   Plane leaves Moosonee and to land in a Provincial Park has to announce that destination over whatever radio to whomever.  Well, it's monitored of course... the plane pictured below flew from Sudbury once, Timmins twice and one other time an Officer came on skidoo from a campsite down the lake.  With all that cost and effort just to bust two or three people of our party fishing in the middle of nowhere, year after year, one would think they'd be hungry to lay a charge.  The officers would sniff around, check the bait on the hooks, numbers of fish kept, numbers of lines, licenses... First time they came in there was a pilot and two CO's.  Different officers each year but the last two it was the same fella, all cool.  Feeling like I was being head-hunted year-after-year I asked why they continue to come in, to which one once replied, ""Kesagami is considered a trophy fishery"" and so receives extra protection.  Have also called CO's in Nipigon & Cochrane over the years and they've been genuinely helpful.  I asked the CO on the Rideau to go through my boat and inspect for everything that the OPP might check as well, he did without hesitation.  It would have to be a case of a few bad apples... and that sucks.  Because it'd be easy to understand just how the stress could easily rise if they were jerks planning to lay just any stupid charge they possibly could.     And here's a pic of some other OFC lurkers...   "
839621,chris.brock,2014-03-04 08:56:00,4053,"If I was fishing Kesagami in the winter, I'd fish that hole right in front of the lodge, I'm guessing they would be stacked in there   like Terry, me and some buddies got tangled up in a bit of a mess-    Happy Day Lodge, near Chapleau, Windermere Lk  it's dusk, a boat blasts up, it's a guy we have chatted with who is staying at Happy Day also  guy- ""the MNR is here, I've got a couple extra walleye, do you want them?"" us- ""no thanks, we're good""  knowing the MNR is around, we stash some empty beer cans on a small island, fish for a while, then head back to camp we get intercepted by the MNR, they search the boat, and find an empty beer can that rolled under the sub-floor, a life jacket they deem to be to old and tattered and an insulated mug that smells like booze, they say go back to our cabin and they will come talk to us  back at the cabin, they grilled us trying to get information about the guy with extra walleye, this went on for over an hour, threatening us about our infractions, playing good cop/ bad cop etc,  I had a moment of clarity I guess, why are we defending this American guy, obviously poaching, and putting ourselves at risk for a fine over an empty beer can?  CO- ""did you see ""guy"" out on the lake?"" our party had denied that for the last hour but I said ""yes"" CO- ""what did he say?""  from then on I just answered everything honestly  long story short, ""guy"" got a big fine, his wife got obstruction of justice fine, we got a warning  interesting thing, the COs took me outside and said ""Do you want to come spend the night in Chapleau? Are you worried for your safety because you told the truth and went against the others?"" me- ""not worried at all, they're my friends, thanks though""  the next morning we picked up our empties from that small island   edit- I thought those COs did a good job, I respect them, I even corresponded with 1 of them a couple times after this incident, great guy"
839627,fishnguy,2014-03-04 12:18:00,96,"I grab my cell to let everyone know to watch out, a neighbor is fishing in his hut close to an island,   Why would anyone have to ""watch out"" if they are abiding by the rules?"
839632,singingdog,2014-03-04 13:07:00,1047,"So glad I am not a CO. On this board, it's a lose/lose proposition to be one. If they do their job, people whine, if they don't do their job, people whine. If someone on the board sees suspicious behaviour, there aren't enough CO's around. If they actually check someone from the board, there are too many COs around, wasting time and gas to (gasp) check and see if the regs are being followed.  So, you grabbed your cell and warned folks that they were coming. That implies that you were worried that folks had something to hide, which means that they were breaking the regs, which means that you were interfering with COs ""protecting the resource"". How often have I seen huge threads on this board, complaining that the COs weren't around to ""protect the resource""?  Sorry Chris, but your whole post (and many that follow it) sounds like one big whine."

I also like his honesty.  He and his buddies apparently enjoy certain adult beverages when it might not be completely legal .... I won't judge him for that, but the COs might.  And I have a feeling that he wouldn't complain about a fine for something he knew was wrong.  Its his money and his choice.  (I would hate him forever if he was keeping illegal fish though - that's just a line nobody should cross  )  Anyway, Chris makes a VERY VERY important point.  Things always go a LOT better if you just tell the truth from the beginning!!!!"

839419,barrystrs,2014-03-03 14:07:00,75,"I am happy with the CO's, it is the police marine unit that is intent on laying fines and harassing people.  They seem disappointed if they cannot issue a ticket, and let you off with a warning even though you have done nothing wrong.  They do a thorough search for alcohol and read the labels of all life jackets.  In a local newspaper interview the cop said their intent is to educate and save lives, toward the end of the article he stated that they issue tickets to about 60% of the boats they stop. Don't get me wrong, I respect the cops and appreciate their work.  I understand that they have a tough job and need to protect themselves, but they need to adjust their tactics to the situation at hand.  Hopefully my experiences are only from a couple of bad apples."

Over the years I've been stopped many many  times by the OPP both in the Kawarthas and up north, infact they stopped me 3 times in one weekend, and I have NEVER had a bad experience with a single police officer on the water. They've always been extremely polite and friendly to me....but then again, that's the way I treat them too."

Meanwhile, at the other end of lake Joe.....Get my point??  I've never had an issue with a CO, or OPP either, but they can be jerks sometimes for no reason. Treat me with respect, they get it in return, treat me like a criminal from the get go, I will be a jerk too. I have nothing to hide, or worry about.  S."

We were out fishing and drove over to see what was up.  There were 4 of them in the plane and although everyone looks happy in the pic, it wasn't all that pleasant of an experience.

I appreciate what they do, and I was grateful they didn't fine us for leaving our licenses back at camp.

They once interrupted a derby of ours, pretty small one, maybe 30 boats. They even let us land fis as they were inspecting boats trying not to disrupt the derby, which i thought was mighty nice. Last year while crappie fishing with a friend, we launch a tinny from his camp and went about 70 yards to our spot. Co's showed up about 20 mins later, checked our catches etc no problem. Dinged my buddy for no life jacket. His problem, i warned him before we launched. He knew he was in the wrong and accepted a pretty huge fine. i think it was $275?  Then after checking my liscense he said i was legal to fish but i had a outdoors card from Alberta??? And I would need to change that asap. No idea what he was talking about lol. Its a ontario outdoors card, ontario address, ontario drivers liscense etc. confused the hell outta me. Still dont to this day. It was just weird.

839365,Rod Caster,2014-03-03 00:31:00,5784,They say not to pat the dogs because any foreign scents (perfumes etc) can screw up their noses. They told my Dad that last week.

839386,leaf4,2014-03-03 02:53:00,2466,observations made over the course of a day ice fishing?
839388,wildeye rainbow,2014-03-03 03:01:00,123,I have no problem with CO's checking me when I'm out.  They are there to protect the resources and catch those who do not play by the rules.  Not enough of them IMO.  WR
839389,SHAD,2014-03-03 03:03:00,134,"observations made over the course of a day ice fishing?  Nah, I thinking something more to it then that.  The observations kinda one directed no?  I mean how was the fishing, what was best lure, was it cold that day?"

True but if we all stop abiding by the regs they would have everything to worry about and how would they deal with the power of the populous then? Just a thought.  Cherry picking with all the other infractions in plain sight irks me to no end. Do the job right or stay out of my face."

Not enough of them IMO.  WR No there aren't enough of them but don't be fooled in the belief they are protecting anything other than their own jobs. If the ministry really cared about the resource they would man up and be done with the mess that is the commercial and indian slaughter.....er... i mean.... harvest of ""OUR"" resource. Simply put, we are just easy targets."
839398,ctdd2006,2014-03-03 03:58:00,531,"there's not many cottagers in the derby, mostly local residents with a bit of a red neck attitude and for right or wrong, a general disregard for the MNR and COs  I'm pretty sure there will be a few who boycott next year  poaching is one thing, a couple beers, riding without a helmet, or towing without a rigid hitch is another (in my opinion) I get it.  Unfortunately the Derby will suffer....sad.  Picking cherries!!!!!  I can tell we'd get along fine....and our bravos could race!  lol"

839400,ONbuckhunter,2014-03-03 06:39:00,39,"quoting moxie  Totally understand and agree but there is one major issue.  Its not the MNR or provinces problem to deal with.  It is a Canadian Charter of rights.  As it stand our Natural Resources legally will always go in order, 1.  Native, 2. Commercial and then 3. us as Sport.  Its written in stone and something we always have to deal with but hard to accept as they are abused."
839407,turtle,2014-03-03 11:24:00,274,"I have no problem getting checked.  What I notice is the push to issue tickets.  The last CO I dealt with ""seemed"" dissapointed not charging me.  First I approached him as he was already n the parking lot and had to go by him anyway.  He didn't stop at checking license and asking questions and had me open up everything and did a bit of a search. Several years ago another CO told he he was disappointed in not charging anyone when he checked a group of 6-8 I was in perch fishing on Couch.  Now anytime I deal with a CO or police I go in that they are looking to charge me, not looking to help me in any way."
839412,Big Cliff,2014-03-03 12:21:00,6899,"In all my years fishing and hunting I have only ever had one bad encounter with a CO. I was coming out from duck hunting 10 minutes before case time and he stopped me before I could put my gun in the case and started talking to me. He checked our shells and all our gear and ducks no problem.  This whole conversation took about 15 minutes then he asked me if I knew when case time was. I looked at my watch and told him it was 5 minutes ago and he said he was going to give me a warning. I insisted he charge me because we were going to be going to court and he was going to end up looking like an idiot. A couple of shots sounded a short ways off and he left in a hurry without giving me a warning or charging me.  I have had many, many other interactions with COs over the years and never a problem, I have even offered to take them out in my boat here in the spring becaues I often see people taking OOS fish and over limits of fish.  Just happy to see them doing their jobs."
839415,bobogo,2014-03-03 12:47:00,76,"Never had a problem with a CO. doesn't matter if it's a derby, a guy fishing with his buddy, group of people renting a hut, the CO should check us all.  And as many have said already, if you're following the rules, nothing for you to be worried about."
