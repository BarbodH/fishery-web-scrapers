Made the 6,000KM drive from Yellowknife to St. Petersberg Florida in 4 very long days of driving. I spent 3 days in Tampa at a hotel as my rental home was not available until Saturday the 1st. Got out for a bit of fishing with my buddy Brian on Friday. The fishing was slow due to a cold front going through the night before but we did get a bunch of ladyfish and a few small trout. We went out for about 4 hours or so and I was sun burnt by the end.  Got the rest of the month to get used to the sun and catch some fish.  â€‹A few pics for your pleasure. Sorry no fish pics yet.  My front yard.    My rental abode.    Sahtu the wonder dog chillin' in the warmth.  "
839371,captpierre,2014-03-03 01:04:00,2521,Kudos to you for driving.  How many tanks of gas?
839372,Whopper,2014-03-03 01:06:00,2174,Good for you to escape the cold.... I thought I get a little carried away driving places but your nut
839374,DRIFTER_016,2014-03-03 01:15:00,10439,"Kudos to you for driving.  How many tanks of gas?  Haven't gone through the receipts yet. Probably somewhere around 10 tanks.  Good for you to escape the cold.... I thought I get a little carried away driving places but your nut  Not the longest trip I have driven. My trips from Ontario to Alaska were about 6,700KMs each way."
839413,Whopper,2014-03-03 12:34:00,2174,"Just poking ya with a stick Dave, hat's off to you for making the drive. That's a long haul and the landscape changes drastically from point A to B Enjoy your time south and don't forget the sunscreen."
839414,Big Cliff,2014-03-03 12:41:00,6899,"Well, it's a lot colder than normal down there for this time of year but it's a heck of a lot warmer than it is here! Wish I was back down there right now, just looked at the long range forecast for here and we are staying well below normal for at least the next two weeks.  Enjoy your stay!"
839427,solopaddler,2014-03-03 15:03:00,8605,"Have fun buddy, and wear lots of sunblock!"
839428,Joey,2014-03-03 15:03:00,9122,"What a nice getaway place to go to, and the dog seems happy to be warm for a change.  Enjoy your stay and enjoy your drive home.  Some of the best memories are from road trips like that!"
839430,Roy,2014-03-03 15:05:00,13728,"Piss off, Orr."
839434,solopaddler,2014-03-03 15:13:00,8605,"How was the dog on the drive? That's my biggest issue with my dog on long drives, she whines non stop LOL!"
839435,solopaddler,2014-03-03 15:13:00,8605,"Piss off, Orr.  "
839472,DRIFTER_016,2014-03-03 17:24:00,10439,"Piss off, Orr.    How was the dog on the drive? That's my biggest issue with my dog on long drives, she whines non stop LOL!  He is great in the car Mike. Sleeps a lot and when he isn't sleeping he sits up looking out the windows checking out the scenery. For the first 20 minutes or so of a trip he is all excited, then he mellows out for the rest of the trip. It's the same when we go to Alaska."
839474,captpierre,2014-03-03 17:37:00,2521,"Dog likely  panting a lot.  Still has his winter coat.  Arctic breeds in Florida struggle.  Watch for heat stroke.  Delirious, crazy panting,  get the hose out with fan and shade"
839475,DRIFTER_016,2014-03-03 18:26:00,10439,He is doing great in the heat. Had him in the puppy spa for a good grooming when I got here. He spends is time in the shade (we have lots of big shade trees) and when he's had enough of the outdoors he relaxes in the comfort of the AC in the house.
839476,solopaddler,2014-03-03 18:26:00,8605,"Dave likely  panting a lot.  Still has his winter coat.  Arctic breeds in Florida struggle.  Watch for heat stroke.  Delirious, crazy panting,  get the hose out with fan and shade   Fixed."
839477,DRIFTER_016,2014-03-03 18:28:00,10439,"Yeah, the pooch is doing better than me in this heat!!!"
839486,Bill Shearer,2014-03-03 19:16:00,456,"Try Sahtu with a little cold Amberbock. He will be fine. Very cool dog Dave, and I'm glad to hear he is doing well! Bill"
839544,Big Cliff,2014-03-03 22:59:00,6899,"Just curious, I am looking for a place down that way for next year, if you don't mind could you give us more details on the area, cost, fishing opportunities close by. PM me if you don't want to post openly."
