838404,Dan668,2014-02-25 22:59:00,1120,Anyone know where this can be picked up in the gta? Seems like ill have to ship it from elsewhere which brings the cost over $20 for a 2oz bottle.
838440,Ryan Landry,2014-02-26 01:48:00,128,"I have a brand new bottle that I bought with the intensions of using it one of my builds, but I just can't do it! Lol  I just like the feel of natural cork. I don't want to sell it, because I like to have it on hand, but Your welcome to use some if you'd like."
838449,Dan668,2014-02-26 02:36:00,1120,Thanks for the offer. Im thinking of doing 20 rods lol. I guess ill just have to pay up. I like the feel of the natural cork also. But hate how it gets dirty/dark quickly.
838462,Ryan Landry,2014-02-26 03:17:00,128,"Just give em a lite sanding every once In a while, that'll do the trick!"
838472,BillM,2014-02-26 04:17:00,17367,Magic eraser works great on dirty cork.
838474,solopaddler,2014-02-26 04:40:00,8605,Angling Specialties will have it.
838571,Garry2Rs,2014-02-26 20:37:00,1425,You have mail!
838703,Fisherpete,2014-02-27 10:37:00,1814,X2 on the magic eraser... Cork looks like new afterwards.
838705,Roy,2014-02-27 11:51:00,13728,"Yeah, I'd go with the eraser as well. I have no scientific data on this but I feel that cork is a living, breathing thing and sealing it just defeats the purpose. Sealing cork probably encourages drying and cracking. All I use is a light mix of water and mild dish detergent,clean gently, dry completely then, if needed, a light sanding with a fine grit paper...300+."
838937,Burtess,2014-02-28 02:48:00,901,I always thought of a nice and dark cork handle as just a build up of fish stories and memories........... never would clean any of mine.  Burt
838959,BillM,2014-02-28 04:21:00,17367,"Yuck, dirty cork is like a dirty toilet!  LOL!"
838962,danc,2014-02-28 05:17:00,4677,"I'm a fan of clean cork too, but I wouldn't suggest using sandpaper. You can easily remove the dirt/grit without taking any of the cork away. Any mild household cleaner will work. Personally, I use comet."
839007,bare foot wader,2014-02-28 16:20:00,1354,"I tried using the cork sealer stuff a long time ago, but ended up not liking the finish it put on the rod, made the grip slicker for me.....every now and then I clean a few handles and rub in a few drops of gun oil, slightly darkens the cork and will show the filler better.....tried waxing a couple times, meh, in the end just not worth the effort, a regular wipe down to keep clean works good enough for me  I've used tooth paste before on really dirty handles, some swear by it but I didn't find it to be any better than just a soapy dish rag"

I usually just took a sponge and some soap/water but this works so much better."
839033,John,2014-02-28 18:26:00,2956,Nothing like a nice clean cork
