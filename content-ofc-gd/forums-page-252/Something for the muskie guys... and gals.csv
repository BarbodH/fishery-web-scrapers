839107,Joey,2014-03-01 04:12:00,9122,"Hahaha, I had one of those.  I used to play with the cat with it, until it broke!"
839109,vance,2014-03-01 04:16:00,719,That with a banjo minnow would be a killer
839120,Handlebarz,2014-03-01 11:34:00,3790,Dang and I broke the bank on new rods at the spring fishing show wish I had seen that before I could have loaded up
839369,jbailey,2014-03-03 00:52:00,866,haha i have one of those
839734,Rich,2014-03-05 00:07:00,3927,"Lol I have one.. hey, it fits in your coat pocket.. something is better than nothing!"
839810,Headhunter,2014-03-05 14:21:00,5703,That thing seems like an ideal product to take down south on a beach vacation. I know I could have and would have used one when I was in Cuba a couple of weeks ago! I could see me catching little reef fish with that all day long... sure would beat the boredom of just sitting on the beach watching the world go by...  HH
