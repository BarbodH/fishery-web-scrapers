""   That smacks of entitlement by a local to me, but whatever.  There's plenty of public crown land that's free and clear for every citizen to use as they wish.  There never has and never will be any need to fish a ""fly in"" lake by using restricted roads.  The tourism industry is huge in northern Ontario. Protecting the outfitters interests makes perfect sense to me."

615481,Alfiegee,2011-08-25 16:49:00,14,"We did this unintentionally to people at a fly in camp last year. A friend of mine took me to a Speck lake north of the Soo. It was a 2 hr drive on old logging roads from the hwy but we made it towing a boat. We really didn't expect to see anyone there. We trolled around a point and here were 4 guys in 2 canoes fishing. They were as surprised to see us as we were them. They had paid quite a bit to be flown into this lake and here we were, in plain clothes I might add. They didn't take any offense to us being there, rather they wanted to know how they could drive in, in the future and said good for us. A little local knowledge can go a long way towards finding places like that. The trout fishing was great and the 6 of us shared the lake for the next 3 days. We were even invited to camp by their outpost cabin.  Alfie."

I can no more support the MNR creating a monoploy on a public lake as I could support the Feds for bailing out Chrysler and GM.

We said we don't have licenses. They were almost salivating by that time. They could hear the dollar signs ringing. We told the COs that we were from Ontario. (For the younger crowd, no licenses for Ontario residents were required). They couldn't believe it. We had to show our drivers licenses...lol. Good folks doing a job that they wanted, and felt lucky to have. I'm sure the present day COs feel the same. When you have done nothing wrong, you have noting to fear. Over exuberant law enforcement officers are nothing new, and usually they get assigned to the boonies. Patience."

Having said that.............busting out of the bush, at night, in plain clothes, to ambush unsuspecting anglers strikes me as unwise in the extreme.  Even the most patient of men, dead sober, might well react poorly to being scared out of his wits by dark-clad figures jumping out of the bushes.

Regardless of how you feel about COs or how they perform their duties ...... this is certainly a good reminder for all of us to stay legal, no matter where we are.  Personally, on my upcoming fly-in, I will make sure my entire group does all the little things properly .... like carry our licenses with us at all times, keep the life jackets sorted properly, zero alcohol in the boats, etc etc etc.  Knowing that the COs can and do go to great lengths to check up on remote groups is a good deterrent against illegal activities.  I also find it interesting that folks are quick to call for extremely severe punishments for law-breakers, but they turn around and complain that COs go overboard in trying to catch the offenders."
839667,Terry,2014-03-04 17:11:00,14456,I disagree. It seems that in these  days of cut backs and the mnr  crying no money. Boating in and mainly flying in  to try to catch 2 guy. Seems like an extreme waste of mnr resources    If they had half a brain they would be at the air port checking them as they get off the plane. I mean except over harvesting. What laws are you really going break.

839673,grimsbylander,2014-03-04 18:24:00,3016,"All very interesting point of views. So if the MNR goes out of their way to try to catch two guys, it's a waste of time and money. If they wait until there is a more highly populated group, they're cherry-picking and harassing. It just seems like everyone has an opinion on when, who, and how they should conduct their duties. Should they hide in the bush and scare the hell out of Terry? Heck no, but that's because it's Terry and we all know Terry's a stand up guy. But if we read in the paper that they busted a couple guys with 100 walleye and they hid in the bush and scared the crap out of them, we'd all applause and suggest they do worse to them. All I'm saying is I think it's dead easy to reflect and criticize after the fact. After we know the outcome.  I had a day last year when I got stopped 3 times on the Upper Niagara. Once by the MNR with a OPP officer on board, once by marine unit police on seadoos and once by the US Marshall. All three were pleasant and no warning or infractions. I have zero issue with being stopped. I just think that with that kind of due diligence, that day someone is going to get caught poaching, or drunk driving, or without proper safety equipment. Go get 'em."
839678,icedude,2014-03-04 19:40:00,459,"Agreed Grims -easy shot to criticize after the fact to be sure--the silly OMNR buggers should have known a lot better to suspect our very own Terry from any violation ,intentional or otherwise.

I have some friends that are currently on a remote lake north of Armstrong as I type this and can just about guarantee if two plain clothes fish cops jump out of the bush on them someone won't be returning."

I don’t remember what outfit you went with; but if they promoted this as a fly-in only, isn’t that false advertising? This is the second thread here that has brought this to light for me. Solopaddler’s “\FamilyTrip------” where Mike said after some research he found that the lake was assessable via a 15 minute ATV ride, from the main drive to camp. Not that your or Solopaddler’s  fishing trip was a bad trip or anything; but my idea of a fly-in is. You ain’t getting there without hours or even days of bush whacking? Like anything else, buyers beware and thanks to you guy for showing/teaching me not to be so naïve and checking into things like this closer.  As for the CO sting; they’re people too; some smart some not so much. Two guys running out of the bush? How’d they know you wouldn’t pull a Burt Reynold’s with a bow and arrow?  Dan."
612575,Big Cliff,2011-08-16 13:25:00,6899,"We were on Biscotasing a few years back, way down at a remote end of the lake. Two guys in a small 12' with fishing rods sticking out everywhere went past us a couple of hundred yards away, waved as they went by, we waved back then they turned and came over toward us. We figured it was just a couple of guys out fishing either wanting directions or just to ask how the fishing was.  Turned out it was two COs, when I asked them why they had all the fishing gear and were in plain clothes they told us it was they only way they could get close enough to people to check them because the only equipment they had available to check that area was the little 12'er.  They checked us out and all was good and they went on their way but for the rest of the weekend every time we saw anyone, we wondered if it might be the COs LOL.  They do have a tough job and there just aren't enough of them to go around, I guess they have to do whatever they can with the limited resources they have available. I wish we had more of them checking the Kawarthas! I see so many infractions every year that go unpunished. People keeping over limits or out of season fish, we only hear about such a small percentage of them being caught. I called MNR tips line 6 times last year to report things, to the best of my knowledge only one or the incidents I reported ever did get followed up on and I'm not even sure it was my call that resulted in it.  If you have nothing to hide there is no reason to hide anything!"
612579,TennesseeGuy,2011-08-16 13:33:00,957,"They are fly in lakes because it's easier and more convenient to go by plane.  It's not unusual to reach an out of the way lake on winter roads, by portaging and riding 4wheelers.  We don't have to board a floatplane to find great fishing.  Just get hold of a strong 4 wheel drive puller and take your 14' aluminum deep into the bush and you'll be rewarded.  In my case I'll take a floatplane and not be dragging boats and carrying OB motors as I did 35 years ago.  No need to become upset because a couple of guys make it to your fly in by taking to their Sorels.  If the fishing's good, enjoy it.  Making ourselves happy is better."
612581,Dara,2011-08-16 13:43:00,3052,You guys are kidding right.  All the threads and posts on here from us up north complaining that the MNR is closing off our road access to lakes to comfort the outfitters and flyin camps and this suprises you.  The roads are closed to regular citizens...no motorized access.  I can't quite figure that one out since you don't pedal a plane but whatever.  You gotta pay big bucks to get to a lake because NOTO bought the MNR and a regular guy isn't allowed to use the lake.  Think of it as a private resort that charges outrageous fees to access for no other reason than they want to line their pockets and your government thinks its a good idea.  I think its because of the spring bear hunt cancellation...had to pay the outfitters to keep quiet and this is how they did it. privatize crown land with laws to keep residents out.  And just remember...the police are everywhere to protect you.
612588,bigbuck,2011-08-16 14:10:00,2449,Stickshift and Clutch strike again!! I'd be a bit perturbed at having them approach in street clothes and in an aggressive manner. I hope you got their badge numbers and you should report their behaviour to MNR. Just because they have a badge doesn't mean they can act like that. I understand that they have a difficult job to do but at least they have a good well paying gov't job. At least you guys were 'clean' (and I don't mean your undies).

613049,Rod Caster,2011-08-17 21:41:00,5784,"Now that I think about it, if they essentially close these lakes off to the public that means the MNR is just there to monitor the fly-in clients. The lodge should be responsible for monitoring their own clients and the MNR should inspect the lodge directly, and fine the lodge for irresponsible clients if their gonna have the lake all to themselves. All in all, fencing off these lakes is a dumb idea.  This is clearly a gray area that needs to be addressed. Is this the actual Minister that is making these decisions?"
613800,solopaddler,2011-08-20 03:59:00,8605,"I'm finding many of these comments incredibly ironic.  First off, you cannot drive to this lake.  What these MNR guys went through to access this lake was quite a lot.  Second, it is a fly in lake, and no the general public at large is not allowed to use the access road to gain access to the lake. (The access road to the south is a good 1km from the lake)  You can legally paddle and portage in from a great distance, that's perfectly fine.  There is no earthly reason to have any sort of beef with the outfitter.  Whether one agrees with the public at large being allowed to use the road or not is a moot point.  The most ironic thing is I just got back from spending a week at this very same camp with my family.  We had an incredible time, caught hundreds of walleye and enjoyed perfect weather. Couldn't have had a better time.  The outfitter in question are a young couple from Thunder Bay and are 2 of the nicest and most accomodating people I've ever dealt with.  Their prices are super cheap compared to pretty much anyone's in the industry and I'll happily fish with them again.  (And for future guests the shower, the running water at the sink and the fridge now work perfectly  )"
613808,Terry,2011-08-20 10:13:00,14456,the post start a humor... and went south from there........     I have no beef with the outfitter   and I would recommend them.....    I am not happy with the way the MNR came running out at us........ but that has nothing to do with the outfitter............
613833,glen,2011-08-20 13:50:00,2641,Ya but it is still stupid.
613839,solopaddler,2011-08-20 14:07:00,8605,"It's incredibly bizarre how the MNR confronted Terry no doubt. But the point is the fact that they paddled and portaged in doesn't detract from the ""fly in"" experience in any way.  As mentioned the public at large is not allowed to use the same access road the MNR did.  Second there's almost no such thing as an outpost camp I can't access via paddle and portage. I've accessed zillions of so called fly in lakes with my canoe.  Unless you're incredibly far north it's entirely possible that the lake you're flying into is accessed regularly by canoeists.  Heck, many of the premier outpost camps in Ontario north of Armstrong in Wabakimi park see scores of canoeists paddle by them enroute. I know I did....many many times.  It's entirely commonplace.  The fact that the public isn't allowed to use the same access road the MNR does actually makes it more remote than the norm in this case.  And no this thread is not going south at all. I just think there's a few misconceptions that need to be cleared up."
613850,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-08-20 15:12:00,0,"you can try and maintain a facade of ""remote"" wilderness all you like..  but i wouldn't be expecting those of us who live up here to accept it any time soon, we know better.  if there's any misconceptions they are being created by the mnr and the outfitters.  "
613862,solopaddler,2011-08-20 16:32:00,8605, This particular outpost camp is no different from hundreds of others than can be accessed quite easily by canoe.  The misconception that this camp is any different from scores of others is false.  Why are people who live up there any more entitled than anyone else in the province?  I've done literally countless canoe trips over my lifetime as well as a large number of fly in trips.  If I go on a canoe trip I've never had any trouble choosing a route or a lake that isn't breaking any laws.  Why should it be so hard for anyone else?  Why does the notion of protecting an outfitters interests rub you so wrong? Can't you see the need?  There's a million lakes up there that are loaded with fish that can be accessed legally by road.  Find one and fish it.
613863,mercman,2011-08-20 16:54:00,7054,"I think the idea of a `FLY IN` trip , is just that, an idea. We as anglers love the mystique and comradery behind this idea. Drive for many miles, unload your vehicules, weigh in and load up the small plane that will bring you to your fishing dream destination.It all adds to the whole`experience` Who cares if there is an old logging road, or private access fire road that leads to the camp What is important is that you and chosen best buds, have Flown in, and shared this experience together Anyways,for most of us city slickers, remote is anywhere you cant drive to, within 2 hours on a 4 lane highway  As far as the MNR acting the way they did, well they are just lucky that it was Terry, and not some gungho kick butt yahoo, who may have thought thier plain clothed visit was an attack in the night.

How I feel is quite the opposite and that I feel ANYONE should be able to access these lakes that have had roads built and maintained by public dollar, on public land.  This is PUBLIC land and not everyone is wealthy enough, or physically fit enough for a fly-in or 7 day canoe trip."

611860,fishnsled,2011-08-13 15:13:00,3520,I wonder why they felt the need to ambush you guys? Seems a bit much but I'm sure they have times when that element of surprise is not enough. Nice to see them doing their job. Good for you too Mr Clean.
611861,Dabluz,2011-08-13 15:16:00,701,"I worked as a conservation officer in Quebec for a while.  I worked in a ZEC (controlled exploitation zone).  We did a lot of stuff like staking out at night near spawning beds or checking for loaded firearms in vehicles at night.  Or portaging for a couple of hours just to check out 1 group of fishermen.  It often brought results and the word did get around that we could be anywhere, anytime.  I know of some conservation officers who never leave their vehiclev.  I also worked with some guys who were scared to write up a report on somebody.  We worked in pairs and it's not much fun when you are writing up citations to a group of fishermen or hunters while your partner is doing something like checking our equipment.  When I had a partner who was willing to go the extra mile, it was fun.  It was particular fun when we checked fishermen or hunters who were genuinly surprised to see us.  It's nice to see that some agents do take their job seriously."
611862,Terry,2011-08-13 15:17:00,14456," I can understand an ambush, at times but for godsakes  wear a uniform when you do  ...and as for Mr Clean, I would think almost everyone here would stay within the law and not give it a second thought.....no big deal"
611866,fishnsled,2011-08-13 15:28:00,3520,"  Absolutely, in this case, wear a uniform. I'd say the same for everyone here as well but there are some gray areas in the regs that might lead to a ticket. I wonder for example - 6 guys on a fly in trip, one guy cleaning the fish that every had caught (let's say there's 7 fish). The others are fishing, drinking whatever and away from the fish. Is the guy cleaning the fish over his limit if the CO's ambush him? If you have cleaned the fish and didn't leave any skin on them and they are in the fridge they'll give the guy who cleaned them a ticket."

611872,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-08-13 16:12:00,0,"these are not remote lakes.   they are lakes that the mnr has put up a fence around so that you HAVE to spend 1500 dollars just to fish them.  the reality is MOST of those lakes are quite accessible, many even by truck.  it's a scam that defrauds the fly-in angler of getting the ""remote"" experience they paid for, and it scams the people of the area who are told they aren't allowed to access crown land lakes that are half hour from their homes."
611873,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-08-13 16:14:00,0,"Terry, you should send this story to the people at Ontora.ca"
611874,wallyboss,2011-08-13 16:14:00,1095,"Dr.salv,  that was exactly what I was trying to say, you used much better words."
611875,cjgraham,2011-08-13 16:21:00,104,Believe me there is no such thing as a fly in lodge up there. I have worked up there before all lodges are accessible by logging road. Most lodges do however own some point to the road and have big metal gates so you can't drive in. There are lodges that let you drive in but most have tell you its fly in only. and Hawk air and the others all will tell you the same thing.
611879,Terry,2011-08-13 16:35:00,14456,never ever thought about it before  I will be asking questions in the future
611903,RickOnt,2011-08-13 19:49:00,669,"Could they actually lay a ""Charge"" based on a picture from your camera?  Or is that just evidence so as to make them search more?  Would you have to let them see the pics on the camera?  Rick"
611908,Terry,2011-08-13 19:59:00,14456,"I think for the most part it would just allow them to search more...but could be used in court along with other evidence  and of course you can refuse to let them see the pictures  but if they feel it is evidence they ca get a search warrant to see them, with the extra powers the MNR has at that point they can take the camera because by the time they got back with the warrant, you would have the pictures deleted"
611909,tomO,2011-08-13 20:03:00,363,In all the years I've went to Canada fishing the only time we were stopped and searched was at lake Ogascanan in Quebec back in 95. We were on the far end of the lake 15 miles from camp when they approached us in their boat.
612082,Terry,2011-08-14 18:35:00,14456,I have no problem with them checking me   but this is a first for me on a fly-in
612201,Jigs,2011-08-15 02:30:00,136," Gary (Rupert), as far as I know the only guy that patrols here checked my livewell last weekend. I've seen him 3-4 times this year first time he asks to see my fish. He's out there but like he was telling me he's the only guy who covers the entire area. Not nearly enough. He told me he caught a bunch of guys with bass in the Raisin before the season opened. He said they told him they thought they were walleyes lol.  Anyway, couldn't agree more though. There needs to be more of them out there. It's scary when you consider the numbers of perch that get taken out of here every year. By the way in my 20+ years fishing around here I have NEVER seen any Quebec conservation officers out here. Not once.  And Terry, about your run-in, that's pretty crazy that they went through all that trouble. I would guess someone called them."
612222,Cudz,2011-08-15 03:46:00,2652,Funny story terry. Sounds a bit bizarre but not as bad as the time I was stopped at a ride program by the opp and asked for my fishing license.
612225,pikehunter,2011-08-15 09:04:00,1659," Hope you had a change of underwear!  Glad to hear that they are at least on the job. I do agree that the time setting up and waiting could maybe have been better invested, but I guess it probably pays off for them in most cases. Who would ever expect an ambush on a remote lake? And yes I'd be ticked off to learn I had spent a small fortune to fly into a lake that was they drove into!"
612249,F_ast,2011-08-15 13:02:00,154,"By biggest problem with this story is the plain cloths.  I dont get that.  When you are that far north and have a couple of guys running at you in a secluded area like a fly-in lake, first instinct would be to swing first and ask questions later.  I am not the type to start something ever, but there are just too many movies... and I dont want to ever ""squeal like a pig"".  LOL.  I just think it was an irresponsible move by the mnr to approach in plain cloths IMO.  And sounds a little too covert of a mission.  Weird."
612252,corvette1,2011-08-15 13:19:00,1765,i paid 5 grand to go to wollaston lake and then a  float plane lands and wants to see a fishing license come on i have seen a guide at quinte with 8 fish over 25'' and only 5 guys on board they don't need to fly-in they can stay local and make a ton of money and then jump out at them thats over kill it's good they check you could hire more mnr for what spend on that plane just stay on 11 and check them there i have been checked on 11 coming back from nakina
612293,Terry,2011-08-15 15:12:00,14456,"if they landed in a float plane I would have felt better  but I have no problem with them checking me  just don't scare me  I didn't take many extra underwear  and the plain clothing was the thing that scared/bugged me  my buddy was closer to them and yelled WHO the hell are you......as they came at us, in an aggressive way....  so I guess after scaring me and busting my bubble about exclusive fly-ins ..there was some satisfaction in the fact that they had to paddle home in the rainy dark ...LOL "
612336,TennesseeGuy,2011-08-15 17:29:00,957,Busting in on your party was careless and reckless.  Possibly a behavior caused by being forced to stop playing with themselves at a young age.
612338,Roy,2011-08-15 17:33:00,13728,"Terry, you should be grateful that it wasn't Connie's buddy from the Red Lake area. You might have been surprised to find a few limits of walleye in your fridge.  And maybe even a few chunks of freshly butchered deer."
612355,TennesseeGuy,2011-08-15 18:00:00,957,"Roy, I fished LOTW August 1-9 and met a guy who hunts moose around Ear Falls.  He started a fishcop story and I finished it for him.  The cop is well known and loves his job.  Can't keep a wife or friends, but keeps his job.  He stopped me on the road home in May 2010, but after a rather long conversation, forgot to check us for fish.  Oh well."
611800,Terry,2011-08-13 10:50:00,14456,"I wasn't going to say anything but what the hell     at our fly-in camp/lake we got caught in a MNR raid  well maybe not caught but caught-up in a raid      we got back in one night about 930 pm  I was just getting out of the boat and my buddy was just off the dock  2 guys came at us out of the bush dressed in normal street clothes , I could not hear what they were saying but the were come at us very aggressively  I didn't know what was going on but it seemed bad/dangerous .I had a machete on the dock and went or it.....I think I could hear dueling banjos...LOL  at that point I could hear them and realized that they were saying ""MNR"" and one of them was holding his badge out. they were not in uniforms  they checked our licenses and fridge and checked all our cameras ..they were hoping to see pictures of stringers of fish over our limit.......  of course everything about us was 100% legal   they hid their boat and hid in the bush so we wouldn't throw all the illegal stuff out of the boat if we saw them waiting for us we had not kept a single fish..they found it hard to believe.. we asked how they got into the lake but refused to talk about it  now the second part of what I didn't like.....they boated into our lake from a logging road.....  so much for a fly-in.........  seems they sat at the camp for hours waiting for us to turn I am told that that the public does not have access to these old logging roads..but still I pay to fly and the boat in....doesn't make me happy   it was real dark when they left and raining pretty hard as the left the camp...they made us feel better that they would have a miserable trip back...LOL"
611802,bushart,2011-08-13 11:20:00,2628,Way To go Terry  You ruined the big stakeout for Starsky & Hutch by not keepin any  Huggie bear is a real bear
611806,mike rousseau,2011-08-13 11:54:00,4661,there is a river in my area that walleye spawn in...  MNR used to sit in tree stands in the bushes with high power cameras and night vision... looking for pre season poaching...   sneaky buggers
611807,rufus,2011-08-13 11:55:00,267,"Wow! Amazing that they would go to all that trouble on mere speculation. That would be unnerving to find guys hiding in the bushes in a fly-in lake!  I once was checked on a portage coming out of a large lake where at most there were just 4 parties fishing on a long weekend. They checked backpacks for fish - seems a waste of time as who the heck wants the extra weight on a long portage? Meanwhile, where I now do all of my fishing north of Kenora there are lots of people fishing and I get checked only once a decade. They are pretty much non-existent."
611814,DT10Sam,2011-08-13 12:10:00,480,"That is hilarious, I'll bet that the MNR are constantly getting guys there at that camp. The fisherman would think that they would never get caught, almost a given that someone would cause an infraction.  WTG Terry they waited all night to get their asses wet."
611816,ecmilley,2011-08-13 12:15:00,2163,imagine if they had that dedication in the kawartha's or the tribs along lake o

611818,Andy,2011-08-13 12:20:00,330," ""I wasn't going to say anything but what the hell."" Me too. I just don't get it. How can you be upset with these guys? They are not the public, they are law enforcement personnel trying to do their jobs. Had they found some one (other than you) who was breaking the law, and they had laid a bunch of charges, people would be making comments about how great it was to see the MNR trying to make a difference. Why should they tell you how they got in the lake? It's none of your business. Were they rude and abusive? It doesn't sound like it. Why would the fact that they left in the dark in a heavy rain make you feel better? That makes no sense at all. Would you feel even better if they got stuck and had to spend a night in the bush? And better yet if they got in an accident and one of then got hurt? I'm tired of some people slamming law enforcement personnel. They are damned if they do, and damned if they don't. Like i said, I just don't get it. Andy"
611819,bushart,2011-08-13 12:24:00,2628,Pretty sure this is all in fun Andy---Just one of those moments  Everyone here I know appreciates and respects the job law enforcement does  As My buddy is a co and my sis is a cop
611820,Roy,2011-08-13 12:27:00,13728,Now I'm just sorry I called in the tip.
611821,Terry,2011-08-13 12:30:00,14456," the only thing I said I was upset with was the fact that I paid to fly in and they came by boat.....   and it is upsetting to have 2 guys come running at you in the middle of nowhere , the dueling banjos comment dealt with that   please show me where I slammed them...  maybe reread my post and that the finger out of your butt or whatever is up there upsetting you"
611822,Bernie,2011-08-13 12:30:00,3190,It's great these guys are doing the job. But often it's their attitude and the way they do it that pisses people off.
611826,lookinforwalleye,2011-08-13 12:39:00,4399,"     And I might be a tad upset that there is a road to my fly-in trip and aswell I may be a tad upset that the operator did not offer a heads up about the Co`s hiding in the bush on this fly-in, not that I would ever keep over my limit anyways.  Add this to the fact that Papa had to make repairs to the camp tells me something about the operator, I certainly would have gave the operator a piece of my mind!"
611827,mike rousseau,2011-08-13 12:42:00,4661,i think most of us think it would be better to have more officers patroling where there are more fisherman... im on the st.lawrence river... ridiculous amount of boats fishing... im in my boat 3-4 times a week... and i only get checked maybe....maybe once a year... usually while im carp fishing.... a fish that your allowed to shoot with a bow and let it float down the river.... and they are checking carp guys like crazy... no limit ...no season... but walleye... i can honestly say that ive never in my life had a CO check my livewell for walleye... never... you would think he would take a peak in the well to see if there was a pile of fish or just a couple.... nope... and ive never heard of the local COs checking anybody elses wells either...  so why spend the crazy amount of time on terry's little croup? why not put that time in on waters with more fisherman and check them properly?  in my opinion that was 2 people's days pay that i helped pay for... and they are pissing our license money away spending a full day trying to catch a specific few anglers on a fly in lake... they should be focused on the masses...  really... how much damage do you think terry's group could do to a lake???really??? meanwhile there are guys limiting 1-2 times a day every day on perch where i live...
611834,TennesseeGuy,2011-08-13 13:37:00,957,"A less than brilliant use of manpower, time and $$$ when one fishcop could have checked your party at the airway when you returned.  There was no probable cause to check you.  Could they have been trying to start with nothing and develop a case against you?  Possibly."
611837,glen,2011-08-13 13:44:00,2641,Sat at the camp for hours waiting for us return.  After all there effort you should have let them ticket you for something.
611838,Joey,2011-08-13 13:46:00,9122,"Wow Terry, that must have had your wheels turning seeing two guys aggressively coming at you out of the bush  I can see why you are upset about the fly in thing, that does suck for sure.  If I flew in and had to use the boat they had there, that you repaired if I am not mistaken, I'd be ticked I didn't bring my Lund and launch that off the logging trail instead  I think what they did would have been great, had they caught someone doing something illegal.  Not sure how legal it is to ask to see the pictures on your camera tho???  What if you and your ""buddy"" had actually done something ""banjo"" worthy that was on that camera     None of their business IMO!"
611839,bushart,2011-08-13 13:47:00,2628,Sorry Sir----your over your limit of empty beer cans in the cabin
611840,Terry,2011-08-13 13:53:00,14456,they sure worked that day for nothing   it's the area they are assigned to so I guess that's how they do it  and when they do make a bust it's all worth while  and I didn't mind or care that they checked us..and I did write this as humour not anger  but they are in the middle of nowhere and we were not expecting people to run up to us  be smart and wear a uniform....if I had a gun they might have been shot because of the way they came at us so fast and aggressively
611841,Terry,2011-08-13 13:58:00,14456," what are you trying to say     LOL  I am sure I could have said no  but we invited them into the cabin out of the rain and invited them to look/search anywhere they wanted to..........and they did  because we had no fish with us when we came it, it limited they rights to search, but pictures of fish on a stringer on the camera would give the the right to search.....I had a stringer but I never even opened the package"
611842,TJQ,2011-08-13 14:06:00,7806,nice... lol
611843,glen,2011-08-13 14:07:00,2641,Terry = Mr.Clean.  I would do a flyin to get away from people not to have them popping out of the bush at any moment.
611844,Terry,2011-08-13 14:18:00,14456, exactly  that was the only thing that got us  had they come in by float plane we would not be shocked by it
611849,Rod Caster,2011-08-13 14:31:00,5784,"Judging by your pic, maybe they thought you were the elusive poaching sasquatch? Imagine the cudo's they would have gotten for that catch!  Good job staying clean Terry... I found it funny that you didn't keep any fish, I bet they were floored by it hahaha."
611852,Terry,2011-08-13 14:45:00,14456,we kept meaning to keep fish just never got around to it too many steaks in the fridge..someone had to eat them
