I just placed the plywood and hatches in the boat to double check the size.  Then  I glued or contact cemented the vinyl to the wood panels. Then installed the wrapped hatches and panels in the boat.     "
838976,lew,2014-02-28 11:49:00,12766,"Very impressive reno on your boat, really nicely done."
838995,sauce,2014-02-28 14:39:00,219,Nice work. Looks like new. You are probably the only person that will ever notice any imperfections. How thick plywood did you use?

839030,tb4me,2014-02-28 17:59:00,3295,I have to do this same reno on my boat this summer..What was the total cost to do all this? If ya dont mind me asking..Good job BTW
839053,Tim Mills,2014-02-28 20:47:00,476,"Thanks for the positive feedback. I got some good advice from previous OFC threads and tinboats.net  Sauce- I used 3/4"" ply to match what I replaced.  You can get the Nautolex Vinyl cheaper from a US supplier like Defender and get it shipped to a US Mailbox.  One problem is that the Nautolex adhesive cannot be shipped to PO Box but they will ship to a person at a US address.  They won't ship to Canada and certain states. I bought the Nautolex Adhesive at West Marine Buffalo.  I used the DAP Weldwood contact cement because some people recommended it on tinboats.net  Hopefully it will hold up.  Nautolex Vinyl- $400/11yrds 72x33 SS Hardware $50 Contact Cement  3x$30 us Nautolex Adhesive $50us/gallon Marine Ply-3 x $100/sheet Misc Chip Brushes, SS Staples $20 Vinyl Roller $20 Epoxy Sealer $175.00 Accetone $20 Edge Trim CTC $20"
