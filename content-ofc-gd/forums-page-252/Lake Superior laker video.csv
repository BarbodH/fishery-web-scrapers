839301,mistaredone,2014-03-02 16:00:00,913,That ice is crazy cool!
839302,Musky or Specks,2014-03-02 16:01:00,2710,Yes saw this already. Awesome video. Do you think they cleared the ice and melted the surface to get it so clear? Tough to imagine no build up of snow on top.
839307,Freshtrax,2014-03-02 16:28:00,2215,Ice fishing with a flasher eh?????
839314,kuhaman,2014-03-02 17:39:00,503,Ice fishing with a flasher eh????? I Never seen that before.

839324,Jds63,2014-03-02 19:07:00,1365,"Those guys must have gps'd that spot from 2010, not as big as the one he got  then but still a monster  wow!"
839326,davey buoy,2014-03-02 19:14:00,5505,"Awesome ice clarity,looks like glass.Nice to see it released!.Sweet video!!!"
839327,Steve,2014-03-02 19:30:00,2075,jigging with a flasher?  that's news to me
839328,Gerritt,2014-03-02 19:36:00,6129,"As others have stated, I have never seen anyone ice fish with a flasher..... Gotta be difficult to jig with?  G"
839343,bare foot wader,2014-03-02 22:11:00,1354,"sweet video, these guys got it dialed in, a lot of guys fish the same setup on cold lake  notice what they're using for bait on the 5/0 hook underneath the flasher? (right hand side of screen at 0:11)  fish the upper 1/3 of the water column with a flasher and big bait and you will catch big lakers all year through the ice...not many, but you're targeting big girls exclusively"
839344,bare foot wader,2014-03-02 22:11:00,1354,it's more of a lift and drop...many guys use a full length rod
839346,davey buoy,2014-03-02 22:21:00,5505,"it's more of a lift and drop...many guys use a full length rod With the size of that clam,a full length rod would be no problem."
839347,Joey,2014-03-02 22:31:00,9122,"What a cool video.  Great catch, congrats!"
