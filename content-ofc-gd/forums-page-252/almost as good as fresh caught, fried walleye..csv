838450,bigugli,2014-02-26 02:38:00,6138,Reminds me of an old deli lunch counter I used to visit on the Spadina some decades back. Huge mountain of shaved cornbeef and swiss piled on an oversized egg bun slathered with mayo and a side of 2 giant kosher dills straight from the barrel. It was a meal for 2 grown men.

Similar story Bruce. Old deli right across from my bank. You know back in the day when you had to go to the bank with your pay cheque to get money   The best  Reuben sandwiches ever with a ton of sauerkraut and pickles on the side. I never did any banking EVER without a deli stop.
