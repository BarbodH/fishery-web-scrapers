836375,SHINNY,2014-02-14 19:23:00,39,"looking to buy a ultra light to fish from perch to trout, ugly stick and the shimano are the last 2, which rod would be better"
836376,Steve,2014-02-14 19:26:00,2075,the worst shimano is better than the best ugly stick.  unless your looking at the rod for a child who will throw it around like another toy.  go with the shimano. i believe the shimano convergence has a rod that would fit your needs....
836377,bigugli,2014-02-14 19:29:00,6138,"I have a 4 1/2 ft uglystick ultralite . Over 8 years it has been through the ringer from perch to pike, drifting harnesses for walleye, and the odd accidental carp.  I love it."
836378,BillM,2014-02-14 19:37:00,17367,Don't forget about Fenwick.
836379,kickingfrog,2014-02-14 19:38:00,8333,Both have durability has the main selling feature. I'd hold them both and see which is lighter and feels more sensitive. I would also not rule out some other rods.
836395,Fisherpete,2014-02-14 21:07:00,1814,"I have a 5' Ugly Stick lite, and have caught everything on it including a 20lb carp... is it super sensitive? No, and I would not recommend it as a walleye jigging rod, but for panfishing and general messing around it is fun and very durable. Great rod for the kids too.  Pete"
836433,GBW,2014-02-15 01:14:00,8460,I had 2 Ugly sticks and now have the voltaeus and I like the Shimano a LOT more.  Sold the other two for next to nothing...
836439,Fisherpete,2014-02-15 01:41:00,1814,"I am not a big fan of the regular ugly sticks, but the lites (cork handle) are good (in my opinion anyway)."
836482,limeyangler,2014-02-15 09:34:00,5204,"Ugly sticks are all right if you need indestructible, but if you want something with a bit more finesse go Shimano."
836486,Handlebarz,2014-02-15 11:39:00,3790,"I have some uglysticks with blue thread wraps they are alot more sensitive over the orange/yellow wrapped ones. I have the 4'8"" they are great I used higher end shimano rods for years but kept breaking them so I went back to UglyStik as they had very durable"
836496,Joeytier,2014-02-15 13:43:00,3990,"Not much experience with ugly stick's, but I really don't like the Voltaeus.  Fenwick makes an UL called a Highlander (exclusive to CT i believe) thats about 60 bucks and it's an excellent blank."
836594,Old Ironmaker,2014-02-16 02:17:00,8243,"Form the money can't beat an Ugly Stick, like many I like both ultralites. My old Shimano Aero is the best one piece ultralite I have. Can feel everything down there and can handle a big fish if one happens by. All of them will break if you close the trunk on them!"
836610,wildeye rainbow,2014-02-16 04:08:00,123,"I like the Ugly Stiks for portaging into back lakes - they take a lot of abuse and stand up.  However, if I wanted an ultra light rod, I would probably go shimano but more likely St. Croix.  WR"
836618,buick14,2014-02-16 12:44:00,741,I'd buy an hmx its close in price pending on where you go....otherwise ugly stick
836647,Steve,2014-02-16 16:33:00,2075,hmx make great rods.  i'd suggest one of those as well.
839218,Tim Mills,2014-03-01 22:59:00,476,Fishing World has a bin full of Ugly Sticks on sale right now.
