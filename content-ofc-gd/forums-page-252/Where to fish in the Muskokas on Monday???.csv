Will be mid morning to noon start and afternoon finish. Will be walking and no hut. Don't wanna walk too far as my time is limited.  Thanks guys"
837803,BowSlayer101,2014-02-22 21:24:00,296,"i would be heading straight for lake joe if i were you, anywhere you fish you'll get fish, the lake is a laker factory!! If you don't wanna walk far foots bay would most likely be your best bet, the bite is always good there but the fish are mostly 1-3 pounders there are 5-15 pounders out there but much more of those little guys but they are tons of fun!"

838002,Musky or Specks,2014-02-23 18:58:00,2710,A little bit further but not much if your going to Joe would be Parry Sound. One of the best ice fishing lake trout destinations there is. 100 ft from the parking lot and your into them.
