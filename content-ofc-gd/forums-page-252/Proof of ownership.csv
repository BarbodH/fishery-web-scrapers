839735,Can_38,2014-03-05 00:17:00,152,"Bought a new to me used boat, as is.  Paid via email money transfer and walked away without any type of receipt.... Ya my bad  Now when I submit my paper work for a vessel registration how will I go about proofing I am the owner?  It would appear I can complete a declaration under oath form, has anyone ever done this? The boat has a ontario # labeled on the side of the hull already, what do I do with this?  Basically looking for help on how to make my rig ligit."
839737,aplumma,2014-03-05 00:28:00,6896,The Hull I D # need to be checked to see if it is stolen first. The registration # should yield the name and address of the owner of the boat so you can get a bill of sale.   Best of luck   Art
839738,Can_38,2014-03-05 00:31:00,152,So how does on check the hull Id# Art.
839739,Can_38,2014-03-05 00:34:00,152,I was given the paper work from the previous owner who purchased vessel at an auction.  I know it's weird that I have the PO bill of sale and not mine.....
839741,Fisherman,2014-03-05 00:54:00,7201,"Man,  some people really jump on the cake with snowshoes.    You're going to have to do the oath thingy.  The numbers stay with the boat, the owners name changes. You now have to do the legwork to find the previous to auction owner,  maybe you can get it through Service Canada.  Hull number is on the right rear outside of the hull at the top.  It's possible(no guarantee) that you can get the number run through CPIC if you know a friendly copper to get the original owner."
839744,Can_38,2014-03-05 01:08:00,152,If I do the oath thingy why would I need to locate any previous owners?
839746,BillM,2014-03-05 01:10:00,17367,"Get a buddy to make up a hand written receipt, sign it, get new registration.  Done.  Scrape the hull #'s off and put the new numbers on that you'll get from the ministry.   I wouldn't be jumping through all kinds of hoops, but that's just me."
839749,Can_38,2014-03-05 01:29:00,152, So the existing #'s on side of the boat will be replaced?
839752,irishfield,2014-03-05 01:38:00,26272,"... and then the serial number would be registered twice in Ontario Bill.. good luck with that one.  Did you get the vessel registration paper from Transport Canada / Service Canada amongst the paperwork from the previous owner. If so... fill in your name.. accompany it with a receipt from your email transfer via your bank and fire it in to Service Canada.  If you didn't get it... you have the original owners name.. 411 him and call him up, nothing to lose but a headache."
839754,Can_38,2014-03-05 01:47:00,152,I did not get any type of registration papers other than signing over the trailer ownership.  The vessel btw is a 50 year old classic BW.  If I track down the previous owner and have him sign a bill of sale will I have enough to register under my name?
839756,BillM,2014-03-05 01:55:00,17367,Does it even have a Hull identification Number?  Check the PDF I just PM'd you...
839758,Can_38,2014-03-05 02:03:00,152,I did find one under a layer (or two) of paint.  Due to its age it does not have a hull I'd tag / capacity located on transom (or near transom).
