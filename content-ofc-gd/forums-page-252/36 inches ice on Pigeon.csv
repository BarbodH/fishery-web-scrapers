839174,lookinforwalleye,2014-03-01 16:42:00,4399,Ya you`ll prolly be ice fishing in April!!!
839176,crappieperchhunter,2014-03-01 16:51:00,2582,I think the latest I have ever been on the ice is April 8. Very good chance that record might fall this spring.
839202,Big Cliff,2014-03-01 20:15:00,6899,We have always had ice out here by April 15th. I'm willing to bet a beer that our bay will still have ice in it by the end of April this year.
839203,Sinker,2014-03-01 20:21:00,8692,"I've icefished well into April pretty much every year, except a few where we had really mild springs. One year I had the boat out in Feb, and two years ago, in march.  I'm betting I'll be on ice until late april around here this year, but things can change quick with the right conditions. You can't base your ice out predictions on lots of ice and snow, the wind has the most impact on ice out.  S."
839220,mattaw,2014-03-01 23:05:00,162,"Up in the Bancroft area I'm hearing that we're looking like a late April ice out unless something changes. As sinker said, the wind is a main factor, as well as the low temps at night being warmer."
839226,cowanjo,2014-03-02 00:52:00,249,"We were on Big Bald this is accurate most we have ever seen. night have been more, fishing was tough"
839233,Basskicker,2014-03-02 01:17:00,421,"Last year we missed walleye opener due to ICE!!! Not looking good for this year, but as stated, things can change quickly."
839236,NAW,2014-03-02 01:47:00,4022,I want to go ice fishing in shorts and a T-shirt!  Maybe this year...
