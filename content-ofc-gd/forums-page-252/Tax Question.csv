837883,Joey,2014-02-23 04:03:00,9122,"I think you will still need a bill of sale to register in your name, and therefore would have to pay taxes on the ""book"" value I would think.  But I could be wrong."

837942,Gregoire,2014-02-23 14:20:00,1397,"I would check with an accountant but as far as I know barter is legal in Canada. There may be some paper work to do, but you should not pay taxes, maybe only a title transfer fee.  I did a little digging and as long as what you are bartering is not something that would regularly earn you income than you should be ok...so as long as you are not a used car or boat salesman you should be tax free.  I bough my last car new from Quebec and when I went to register it I was not asked to pay provincial sales tax on it, so it is possible to register a vehicle without paying taxes."

You plated a new car in Ontario, purchased from Quebec and didn't pay HST?   Or what this like 20 years ago?  If you buy a new car in Quebec today, you'll be paying HST in Ontario when you plate/register it."
837973,HTHM,2014-02-23 16:51:00,4082,"If this deal does go through, I hope to have a definitive answer tomorrow."

If you buy a new car in Quebec today, you'll be paying HST in Ontario when you plate/register it.  It was a pretty recent transaction. My point was that you are not always asked to pay taxes when registering a vehicle."
837997,nancur373,2014-02-23 18:35:00,1211,Ask Wayne about it. I remember him saying something about barter is still legal.
838043,captpierre,2014-02-23 23:23:00,2521,"As far as I know, if you trade a car in at a dealership, you pay tax only on the difference  might apply here too"
