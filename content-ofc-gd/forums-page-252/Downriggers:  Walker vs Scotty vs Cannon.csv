838665,fishnguy,2014-02-27 02:26:00,96,"Great answers, thank you all.  Lots of votes for the Scotty riggers.  The 1116 sound like pretty good bang for the buck.  Anyone tried the Cannon Digi-Troll 5?  Looks very slick.  The ability to pair it with the depth finder looks amazing, but not sure it's worth the extra dollars.  Any thoughts?"
838671,BillM,2014-02-27 02:43:00,17367,You still gotta get up and reel in or let out all that line...   I don't see the point.
838672,fishnguy,2014-02-27 02:49:00,96,You still gotta get up and reel in or let out all that line...   I don't see the point. Yeah that's a good point.
838683,miller,2014-02-27 04:29:00,223,I don't believe the cannon link is available anymore to link it to a humminbird however you can still use all the extra features like cycling etc directly on the rigger. I have the mag 10s and they do everything I'd need them to do so honestly I don't see it being worth the extra cash.
838693,Twocoda,2014-02-27 05:41:00,4130,"I have 2 Canon Mags and 2 Walker Tournament Series...both awesome ...Walker are faster to retrieve though ,,,had an issue with one Walker in the first year (gear stripped) during a derby...I was then on my way to the nearest dealer in Owen Sound from Kincardine and my cell phone rings (president of Walker)...Are you near Underwoood Dave? ...yup just passed it i replied ...Turn around he said ...i see Huron Rod and Gun has an application to be a dealer...when Brad hands you a over the counter swap ..let him know he is now an approved Walker Dealer...Now that was impressive!!!! I was back on the water in Kincardine within an hour from the exchange"
838719,Crazy Ivan,2014-02-27 13:43:00,184,I'm curious about the free- falling Scottys. Wouldn't your line/lure get tangled up with the cable dropping it that fast?
838723,alexmedic,2014-02-27 13:56:00,186,"I learned to rig with Scottys and I guess because of that they are my favourite.  I few years ago, hen I got my first boat, I got a great deal on used Big Jons.  I had them for one season and sold them and bought Scottys.  I just found the Scottys easier to use, and I love the fact that they manual drop.  You just seem to have more control on the descent.  On another down-rigging note, when it comes to releases, I use http://www.downriggerrelease.com (Chamberlain Releases).  IMO they are the best."

They aren't free failing and if you've got the clutch adjusted that badly that they are just flying off the spool, you're going to have issues.   They go down about as fast as any other rigger.  Where they shine is when you're bringing them back up."
838982,Crazy Ivan,2014-02-28 13:37:00,184,"Understood, thanks guys."
838986,DOS,2014-02-28 14:01:00,119,"walkers .... Canadian made and bullit proof the chrome looks slickk too plus a small footprint! Not any more, Purchased by Berts Tackle last year.  Saw them at a trade show a couple months ago and they assured me that the Riggers are still the same quality but with a few minor modifications so they can be mounted on the Berts system.  All repair parts are still available but it is no longer a trip to Stayner to have them fixed.  RED"

838446,ctdd2006,2014-02-26 02:32:00,531,I'm a scotty guy.  By default because I got them from my dad...but I had a service issue and it was the best service.  Made in Canada...serviced in canada.
838447,mcdougy,2014-02-26 02:33:00,274,"Warranty for cannon ( Johnson outdoors) is hard to beat IMO. Cambridge is where the warehouse is, if that's close to you?    Again they are a stand up company IMO"
838465,fishdawg,2014-02-26 03:25:00,912,"Scotty, hands down. Canadian made for one. Fairly accessable and responsive pro staff willing to help if any issues arise. Yes they have a big ""footprint"" in comparisson to other riggers, but they are the most durable, longest lasting riggers out there."
838471,BillM,2014-02-26 04:16:00,17367,"Scotty..  Canadian made, zero issues with the pair of 1116's I've got on our boat."
838480,Terry,2014-02-26 11:56:00,14456,Scotty hands down.   And super fast.
838481,Fisherman,2014-02-26 11:58:00,7201,Scotty.
838482,strik,2014-02-26 12:06:00,175,I like my walkers had them for years..  I do like the power down for setting two rods on one rigger.
838484,BITEME,2014-02-26 12:32:00,1968,Scotty hands down manual or electric
838496,Gallie,2014-02-26 14:01:00,1215,We have only used invader manuals and big jon electrics and the big jons have been good to us. All the other rigging equiptment is scotty gear with no complaints
838498,Sebastian,2014-02-26 14:10:00,208,Scotty.
838500,BillM,2014-02-26 14:12:00,17367,"I forgot to mention we had some old BigJon manuals on the boat when we lived in St.Catharines years ago...  Awesome awesome little riggers, very easy to bring up from the depths (Even for a 10 year old, lol)"
838511,Fishing4Tails,2014-02-26 14:40:00,38,Scotty !! Canadian made .. Lifetime warranty .
838521,BFSC Kevin,2014-02-26 16:31:00,1351,"I run Scotty.  I haven't had any issues with my electric 1116s.  If I had to buy another pair of riggers, I wouldn't hesitate on them."
838524,bassassin,2014-02-26 16:57:00,152,walkers .... Canadian made and bullit proof the chrome looks slickk too plus a small footprint!
838550,tonyb,2014-02-26 18:50:00,1637,"They will all work well.  Walkers can't handle weights heavier than 12-13lbs  Scotty is good, but I personally don't like using the clutch mechanism for lowering the weight, nor do I like the way the plastic bead is used for auto-stop purposes.  Canon are my favorite because they use conductivity to stop to weight at water level, and have built-in positive ion technology (like the scotty black box) to attract large fish to your boat  It's all about the positive ions! Tony"
838555,miller,2014-02-26 19:19:00,223,"I'm another vote for cannon, I have the mag 10s and they are great. Fast, autostop at the waterline, and they can handle larger weights no problem."
838567,12footspringbok,2014-02-26 20:15:00,459,"I fished the 3 you mentioned last summer a few times plus  big jons.  Scotty hands down are my favourite. Walkers are junk IMO, guys at the campground always have issues with those things. Cannons were pretty nice but not as nice as the Scotties..."
838575,Roy,2014-02-26 21:04:00,13728,walkers .... Canadian made and bullit proof the chrome looks slickk too plus a small footprint!  Walker were in Canada for 20 years then moved back to Michigan as far as I know.
838597,BITEME,2014-02-26 22:41:00,1968,"Just my two cents  I have fished all the older names electric and manual as crew as a kid on charters or for pleasure along the way. Hell we used old thermal printer sonar or the old print disks. I m a bit old school and my belief for least headache and a bit of sweat once in awhile.  Hands down manual Scotty's on a tilting swivel base,  5 foot tele boom , couple hundred feet of cable and the setup is bullet proof. Years and years of fish pounding enjoyment hassle free. If I do another boat down the road I would buy them again in a heartbeat no question. You can get them cheap sometimes on kijiji you don't need to get them new( bulletproof)  Cheers Peter"
838604,camillj,2014-02-26 23:15:00,1988,Had manual walkers back in the day (when dinosaurs wee still young)... loved em ... but wouldnt trade in my Cannons (cant remember the model but theyre electric and work like a charm .. other than busting a pin when I got caught up (*redfaced* - dont ask) while backing outta my mooring ... I havent had any issues !
838610,spinnerbaitking,2014-02-26 23:30:00,1622,"Scotty Electric's, they are the fastest when you feel like chasing the big boys your marking, free spool going down you can drop 75' in seconds. Tight Lines SBK"
838644,Moosebunk,2014-02-27 01:40:00,3970,"I like Cannons, Scottys and Big Jons.  In no particular order.  They're all good.  Seriously.  Pick one and that'll be ""your"" favorite in no time."

838664,mcdougy,2014-02-27 02:24:00,274,Here is a little more food for thought about choosing your downrigger provider.  Scottys is a canadian company originally. The scott family. Still manufactured in B.C. Majority owner is a fella from England who purchased his share and moved to here (Canada) to be a hands on owner.  Cannon is owned by Johnson outdoors. Johnson outdoors was started by Sam Johnson of Johnson/Johnson ie..waxes ......  With an endless supply of money and being an avid outdoorsman he started buying companies whose product  he liked and thought was good quality. Johnson outdoors has bought and sold off a bunch of companies in the past and present. It is a publically traded company and reports to its share holders.   Not sure if this makes any difference for your decision process but thought I would share it.  DR's are a fairly simple apparatus in theory. Looks like cannon has a bit of a lead in the RD department.  Scottys make a lot of plastic for various things/businesses.  Cheers MM
