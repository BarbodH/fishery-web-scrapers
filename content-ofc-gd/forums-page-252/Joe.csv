As soon as we got the hut up, we had one fish each and were releasing all the fish, because we wanted something bigger. After at least 2 hours of good consistent action, i put on a williams gold spoon and it went uphill from there. Got 2 nice ones in 15 minutes that were pulling drag like crazy! After Chris seeing how well the spoon worked for me, he decided he wanted tog I've it a shot too. He put on a silver spoon and we had a double header in 10 minutes, had a CO check us as well, nice to see them circling around the lake. I had a great time on the ice, so many fish iced that i lost count, mostly fish in the 1-2 pound range but tons of fun nonetheless! here are a couple pics for now, will post a couple more ounce i get to the cleaning process![/url"
