838934,Fang,2014-02-28 02:42:00,1330,"I've got a crest liner 1750 w/115 Merc and towed it with a few different class vehicles. Do some research and try to keep to vehicles with a 3500 lb tow rating.  For several years I towed with a Safari van, then a ford expedition and now a gmc envoy. When behind the ford you'd never know you had a load, the Gmc does a fine job now as long as you don't want to set any acceleration records. Stops in good distance too.  I just traded the ford in and looked at 3 vehicles that would easily do the job. Acadia, Durango and Pilot all will do the job. 4x4 is nice to have but I've been driving an AWD for the last month and I think as long as your at decent ramps you shouldn't have any problems"
838942,BillsTheBassMan,2014-02-28 02:50:00,932,Awesome info.  Do you have any idea how much your rig weighed?  What I am looking at is almost identical.
838961,Old Ironmaker,2014-02-28 04:43:00,8243,"Bill to get your gross weight tow the rig to a quarry or scrap yard and put it on the scale and  disconnect the tow vehicle. If they aren't busy they usually don't charge. Then you will know exactly what you have without gear and passengers.  Don't overthink this thing. A pal tows a 22 foot Starcraft with a 90 loaded with gear and groceries etc.on short and long hauls with a GMC Canyon 5 cylinder with no problem. 2 wheel drive. Caution when towing anything goes a long way. Apply brakes early and do the speed limit, especially on ramps.  4X4 comes in handy on iffy wet and muddy ramps. Otherwise with that rig front wheel drive isn't a problem. I know we are talking far different vehicles but before the 80's not many 4X4's around and towed very large boats and trailers with station wagons and family cars with rear wheel drive only, no ABS and only drum brakes."

839008,hutch4113,2014-02-28 16:24:00,374,"I can provide a little feedback on my towing experience with an SUV.  I have a 18.5 Smokercraft Pro Mag, with 115HP Merc.  I estimate its weight at 2200 pounds.  I currently tow it with a 2010 Hyundai Veracruz AWD with a Class 3 Hitch, which is up to 5000 pounds.  Generally speaking the vehicle tows fine.  However there are a couple of things I don't like:  1) When connected to the vehicle, the backend sags down further then I would like. 2) Not enough torque in this engine. 3) When launching at some ramps, the water comes up over my exhausts, due to the backend being low.  I have also dragged the spare tire along the ground when the launch ramp is steep.  One thing I did not take into account is Payload.  If my vehicle is rated at 5000 pounds, it sounds like a big number.  But 5000 - 2200 leaves me 2800.  Put 3 people in the vehicle - say at 200 pounds each leaves me 2200.  Load up the back end with gear....etc....and you get the picture.  I am going to be selling my car, and will buy a Truck -> most likely a Ram 1500 with Diesel.  It will be a daily driver, so I am getting Diesel more for that, then for towing - though 420 pounds of torque will be nice to have!!  Will you be able to tow fine with a SUV - Yes.  Will it be the best vehicle for the size of boat you buy - that depends on how much weight you are adding to the boat/vehicle, where you are launching (nice road/ramp vs backroad/ramp).  Should also advise I have never had an issue pulling the boat out of the water.  In terms of safety, I have never felt unsafe towing with the SUV - except once during stopping - but that was my fault (did not leave enough distance, locked up the wheels).  Basically a SUV is a compromise vehicle IMO -> it does a lot of things ok, including towing.  But it is not the best vehicle for it."
839010,Raf,2014-02-28 16:31:00,3495,"the veracruz is not even an SUV, it's a crossover vehicle.  true SUVs like the 4runners, grand cherokees, tahoes, etc are a completely different ball game then these crossover vehicles when it comes to towing."

One that caught my eye but I could not find one to test drive is the Chevy Traverse. Towing rating of 3500 lbs, loads of room and great gas mileage  Other thing I did was to use auto trader and pick SUV category.

I seriously doubt or rather yet, I make a hefty bet that your payload is no where near 2800, or no where even near 2000lbs. My 3/4Ton Ram has a payload of about 2200lbs.

838700,BillsTheBassMan,2014-02-27 07:38:00,932,"Hey OFC,  I have been doing a lot of research over the last few months on what boat and suv to buy.  I am nearing the time to close on a early 90s Crestliner 17ft deep-v aluminum.   It has a newer 90hp outboard and the owner has agreed to multiple tests including a compression test.  The seller and I do not know the weight (almost impossible to find specs).  I am guessing it is approx 1700lbs with trailer/motor/boat/light gear.  Does anyone have a more accurate guess?  My main question/problem is finding my next vehicle that will accommodate towing this boat and my daily needs.  I am looking at v6 models under $20k, 2008 or newer around or under 100k.  I prefer a factory tow package (which is really limiting my search).  I am mainly looking at Jeep Grand Cherokee, but would consider an Acadia and maybe a Honda Pilot. Everytime I get close to the right vehicle something throws it off.  If you could help me with any/all of the following questions that'd be great.  1)  Do I need 4x4 or AWD?  I have found an Acadia with a tow package at a reasonable rate but its FWD.  It's rated for 5k TC  2) Are aftermarket hitches/transmission coolers as good as a factory tow pack?  I could have a vehicle tomorrow if it wasn't for the lack of tow packages.  3) Will I need heavier brake pads or trailer breaks?  With either the Acadia or JGC I seem to have plenty of pull.  4) Should I lean towards diesel JGC models for towing purposes?  This will be my first boat and I want to make sure that I am well equipped with the right vehicle to tow it safely for years to come.  Any insight is appreciated  Thanks Ryan"
838701,chris.brock,2014-02-27 09:11:00,4053,"some guys will say you'll need 4wd for launching the boat, I don't think so though, get 4wd if you want it for snow or off road stuff  sounds like you might a little over cautious, I don't think it has to be that complicated and doesn't require a super heavy duty tow vehicle  I like diesels (I wish more car/ truck models were available with diesel engines), but I don't think it's necessary"
838702,Fisherpete,2014-02-27 10:31:00,1814,"If I was in your situation, I would go 4x4. My boat package weighs around 1000lbs, and on most ramps and in most situations is fine, but there have been a few times that I barely was able to get the boat out with my FWD Ford Escape. I used to drive a Jeep, it was a great tow vehicle."
838706,porkpie,2014-02-27 11:53:00,2521,"You can add all of the aftermarket towing gear no problem, don't worry about that!  I would always go 4x4 though, it is one of those things where if you need it, you really need it.  There are a few hairy launch ramps that I might not have made it out of without 4x4.  No input on the type of vehicle, I've only ever had pickup trucks or Japanese SUV's."
838709,Gerry,2014-02-27 12:27:00,257,"The thing with tow vehicles is not the pulling abbilities, its the stopping and controlling in evasive maneuvers. I once had a Lund ProV 1800 with a 150HP weighing approx. 2700 lbs and towed witha Ford Explorer V8, 2x4. I had 2 incidents with this that tought me a valuable lessen......if you tow something heavy, tow it with somwething heavy. The 1st incident involved the inability to stop. Here I was driving and sort of daydreaming and come up to a 4 way stop. Although I was late in applying the brakes I thought that I had plenty of time and space. Well let me tell you that my boat felt like I had a freight train hooked up at that moment and it pushed me through the interesection....luckily I didn't hit anyone or anyhting. From that moment I decided that I will never have a boat without its own set of brakes.  My 2nd inciednt occured when I launched on a sandy beach, again with the Lund. When it came time to pull out I had to back in to where the rear wheels were half submerged. The rear wheels spun and I sunk in to the axle.....had to get towed out. From that moment I decided the 2x4 Explorer had to go.  I had a 3rd incident with this rig. Thisd happened while driving on Hwy11 south of North Bay when this idiot decided to pull out in fron of me. I could not avoid hitting him unless i swerved into the left lane. When I did this the boat again became 4 times heavier and it decided it didn't necessarily want to follow me. It greatly increased the turn that I intended to make to avoid the accident and I almost lost control. So here again my Explorer wasn't heavy enough.  The rig that you are looking at 1700 lbs might be OK with a mid-size SUV.....i.e the new Pilots, Jeep Cherokee. A 4x4 may not be necessary if the ramp you intend to use is a good one and that you will only be using it in warmer weather.....i.e no ice and snow. I've have had 4x4s ever since I got rid of the Explorer 2x4 and althought they are less fuel efficient, they are necessary for me. Hope this helps."
838721,Lape0019,2014-02-27 13:47:00,647,"I guess I am lucky in that my tow vehicle is not a daily driver. She sits in the garage during the Fall and winter ad gets driven occasionally on the weekends. Unless it is Boating season, there is no need for her to move.  For your questions and realising this is your daily driver:  1) Do I need 4x4 or AWD? I have found an Acadia with a tow package at a reasonable rate but its FWD. It's rated for 5k TC -No you don't need 4x4 or AWD, but there will be instances you will wish you got it if you decide against it. There are ramps out there that you will regret using if you don't have one of those systems. If I could choose 1, it would be 4x4 because you can choose when to use it instead of waiting for it to kick in.2) Are aftermarket hitches/transmission coolers as good as a factory tow pack? I could have a vehicle tomorrow if it wasn't for the lack of tow packages. - I have no issues saying that an aftermarket hitch is just as good as a factory one. As for a trans cooler, for the weight of your boat, I do not even believe you will need one of these. If you want to have one installed, it won't hurt, but it is something I just don't think is required. Having said that, I got caught up in the 0% financing on a new truck that has all of these toys. The problem I had was my monthly payment for a new truck was the same as a $20,000 truck that was a few years older all because I could only finance the older trucks up to 48 months. Again, my trucks sits a lit so when it is paid off, it will still have less than 100,000K's on it so I figured it was worth my while to just buy new and have this things for 10 - 15 years...3) Will I need heavier brake pads or trailer breaks? With either the Acadia or JGC I seem to have plenty of pull. -When your vehicle is rated for a specific towing weight, items like your suspension and brake pads are taken into account. Again, you don't need heavier stuff. Trailer brakes are always good but I would not worry too much about them if they are not on the rig you are looking for. My rig weighs in at just over 2000lbs and I barely notice it behind the vehicle. If I have my dad’s fiberglass deck boat (Just over 3500lbs)on the other hand, I know its back there even though it has trailer brakes! 4) Should I lean towards diesel JGC models for towing purposes? - I don't know much about the Jeep's towing capacity but I would not limit yourself to this vehicle on the towing side. If you are thinking more about your daily driver, this may be a good route for you but remember that maintenance is a whole lot more expensive on diesel engines and with the higher price on diesel, I just don't think you would be saving all that much in the long run.  I know I spend about $50.00 on an oil change and for a VW to have the oil change/water separator replaced it is close to $150.00. I would imagine that would be close to the price on a JGC.  If I had to choose between the three vehicles you listed, I would go with the Acadia if you could find it with straight 4x4. The problem is, I believe they are only available in AWD (I could be wrong but this is what I remember). I believe this is the largest of the vehicles you are looking at and that is why it would be my top pick. After that, I would go with the Jeep and I honestly don’t even think I would try to tow with a Honda Pilot. It may be more than capable but I just don’t think of Honda as a tow rig.   So to go on and on, but I hope you find it useful!  Adam"

838756,aznphil,2014-02-27 16:12:00,73,"Ryan,  I am in the exact same ""boat"" as you.  I've been researching like a mad man the past year so let me share some info:  I'm almost 99% on a lease or lease taking over on an F150, 4x4.      As said before the tow accessories can be aftermarket.  My second choice was a used 09 Honda Pilot, ~100k, <$20k.  Definitely a tow worthy as well as do-everything vehicle.  The main factor for me was knowing the added stress/maintenance when towing.  Now compare a brand new vehicle w. warranty w. a 5 yr old (albeit Honda) in its mid life, which will cost more in terms of upkeep/repairs after another 4-5 years of use.  Mind you its not needed for the boat you describe, but it will def. give you a peace of mind compared to all other candidates.  I myself have not found ""the boat"" for me yet, but I can't stop dreaming of a >17ft repowered bassboat, so I'll keep looking until I do find her.  If you're adamant about used then just get a Honda (Toyotas are overpriced)."

However, if you are loaded down with gear and people, those vehicles will bog down on inclines and hills and will get terrible fuel economy.  A full size SUV like a Tahoe, Yukon, Expedition, Suburban, Aramada etc with a small V8 will get almost the same mileage (better than the V6 while towing) and offer you more space, more power, significantly better handling while towing, and a heavier duty trans, suspension, brakes, cooling system, and drive train.

My understanding on the jeep liberty is that the wheel base is too short for really effective towing but owners seem to have no problems with them.  Again, I appreciate all the information.  Ryan"
