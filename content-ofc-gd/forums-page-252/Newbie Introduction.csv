837019,SWOrange,2014-02-18 18:33:00,6,"Hi All,  Have been lurking for a while here, just thought I would introduce myself.  I live in London, so I'm typically fishing the Thames and the Grand Rivers for pike, bass, walleye. Also get out onto Lake Erie a few times a year.  Have just been getting into the steelhead/salmon runs these past two years, so I'm still fairly new to those species.  Also just picked up a Crappy Tire special fly rod/reel combo this past fall, so have been learning the ropes there slowly but surely.  Anyone fishing the area on here, feel free to drop me a line!"

837297,SWOrange,2014-02-19 23:41:00,6,"Thanks folks.  I fished a fair bit as a kid with the old man, but have only started to develop the addiction over the last year. This past summer was my first really trying to learn.  Lots more to be learned, that's why I'm here."
837347,i2cool2fool,2014-02-20 10:51:00,349,Welcome to the forum. It's nice to see another London area fisherman.
837377,Old Ironmaker,2014-02-20 15:57:00,8243,"There's no cure for what you apparently just contracted fortunately. You are in a great centrally located area. Ports, Burrell, Bruce and Stanley on Erie, Long Point Bay, The Thames and LSC and Detroit River. I don't know about the Grand River? I don't fish it much because it's 15 minutes away and when I do, no luck other than big Cats in Dunnville.  Welcome. Come on in."
