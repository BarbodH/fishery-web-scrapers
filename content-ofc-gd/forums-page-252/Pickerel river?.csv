839001,cram,2014-02-28 15:19:00,1733,Anyone fish the pickerel river?  How different is it from the French?  On a map it looks like one system but I rarely hear about it so wonder what it'd be like to try. 
839005,solopaddler,2014-02-28 15:57:00,8605,"I've fished it many times downstream from hwy 69. In general I'd say it's pretty similar to the French. Beautiful scenery, pretty remote feel and definitely some good fishing."
839014,Freshtrax,2014-02-28 16:41:00,2215,"Same as the French,  great fishing, and some of the most stunning landscapes our province has to offer.   Watch for rocks, no charts for that area of the river."
839038,bigcreekdad,2014-02-28 19:00:00,546,"The Pickeral holds some very large muskie. Definitely worth fishing. If you are looking for a lodge, Camp Wanikewin is very reasonable and has been run for a long time by the Baker family....nice folks.  I haven't fished it in 20 years, but it's on my bucket list to get back there."
839040,Musky or Specks,2014-02-28 19:16:00,2710,As said above some great musky fishing to be had upstream of 69 as well as right down into the French. From what I understand the walleye fishing is pretty good to.
839110,Tim Mills,2014-03-01 04:17:00,476,Camped there 1 night last summer on my way to North Bay.  Nice scenery and I caught a few fish. My site was in the Camp Island area.  $10 a night.    Site 904      
839132,Entropy,2014-03-01 13:28:00,747,"horrible place, stay away, no fish there.   Shhhhhhh!"
839134,bigcreekdad,2014-03-01 13:35:00,546,"Entropy....you are correct. My post was purely delusional, and why I should not try going off my meds.  Doesn't it dry up by early July anyway?"
839136,Entropy,2014-03-01 13:40:00,747,"yep, it dries up,  lol,   better delete this thread before it offends someone, eh.  Entropy"
839153,cram,2014-03-01 14:50:00,1733,Ha - thanks guys. Much appreciated.
839154,SuperDave,2014-03-01 14:52:00,204,Been there a few times for muskie ... tough fishing.
839156,solopaddler,2014-03-01 14:58:00,8605,"From what I understand the walleye fishing is pretty good to.  There's an exceptional seasonal fishery for trophy sized fish in the late fall.  Trolling certain key areas with large floating Rap's, you'd be shocked at the quality of the fish. ""Quinte like"" comes to mind.  Only problem it's oftentimes a night fishery and it can get pretty chilly up there that time of year. Hardcore angling at its finest."

Never had much luck for walleye or 'ski on the river, even in spring summer or fall.  It does not live up to it's name.  Not joking on this comment.  15 years ago things were much better, but now days your lucky to catch a walleye.  I don't think I have personally seen a 'ski come out of the water in the last ... 25 years, pike yes, but not 'ski.  just my 2 cents.  Entropy"
