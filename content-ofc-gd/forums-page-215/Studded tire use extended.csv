871961,Bernie,2014-09-11 16:20:00,3190,"Studded Tire Use in Ontario Extended  The Ontario government has just announced it has extended the time period when northern Ontario drivers are allowed to use studded tires. Drivers who live in northern Ontario can now put on studded tires earlier and keep them on longer, providing motorists with more options to stay safe during severe or extended winter weather. Northern Ontario residents can now use studded tires from Sept. 1 to May 31. Previously, studded tires were only allowed from Oct. 1 to April 30. The change is based on advice and recommendations from the Ontario Provincial Police (OPP). Studded tires can be used on vehicles that have an ownership address in northern Ontario, which includes the districts of Algoma, Cochrane, Kenora, Manitoulin, Nipissing, Parry Sound, Rainy River, Sudbury, Thunder Bay, and Temiskaming.‚Äù They can also be used on out-of-province vehicles travelling in Ontario for less than a month. Please note that only Scandinavian standard lightweight studs can be used in northern Ontario.

872039,OhioFisherman,2014-09-11 22:33:00,6623,Our law makers 140 or so miles south of us in Columbus caught a lot of flack when they tried to ban them here! They don't see much lake effect snow there.
872042,pike slayer,2014-09-11 23:18:00,1177,wouldn't it be a bright idea to let southern ontario people to use studs(possibly a shorter season then us northerners). seems like every year there are mass pile ups and more freezing rain.
872045,leaf4,2014-09-11 23:44:00,2466,"I personally don't think so, the reason they aren't allowed in southern ontario is they tear up the road, with the volume of cars we have, being the most populous province and the highest density population in the GTA it would help, but I think ""cold weather tires"" so as to not say the W word would help out a great deal, also winter driving courses would too"

872215,OhioFisherman,2014-09-13 01:12:00,6623,"(1) Except as provided in division ((2) of this section, no person shall operate any motor vehicle, other than a public safety vehicle or school bus, that is equipped with studded tires on any street or highway in this state, except during the period extending from the first day of November of each year through the fifteenth day of April of the succeeding year.  Ohio's law pertaining studded tire use, it is unusual for us to have snow before November, also after April 15th."
