872362,grt1,2014-09-14 00:54:00,638,over the past week I have discovered that 3 of my good graphite poles have developed loose guides. I am hoping the members here would have some idea on how I can fix them without sending them out to a person who repairs them professionally.  I was thinking about using the glue that is put out to put the end guides on .  any suggestion would help
872396,Mister G,2014-09-14 11:08:00,1429,"Please do not glue them, you will only make a mess and it probably will not work. You need to re-wrap them. Either have someone do it or just YouTube it and you will see how easy it really is."
872458,NANUK,2014-09-14 16:48:00,797,"Not to hijack the thread, Can any one recommend a person or place around GTA where I can have the guides ""re-wraped"" on one of my spinning rods ?"
872460,Raf,2014-09-14 17:03:00,3495,"angling specialties will redo guides.  three locations in the gta, the rod work all goes to the one on hwy 7."
872472,grt1,2014-09-14 18:40:00,638,"ok we got southern Ontario covered , how about the northwest , any guys up this way know anyone who can re wrap my rods."
872502,Spiel,2014-09-14 20:09:00,9065,Too bad you weren't closer Sir I could fix it up for you quickly.  I would ask are these expensive rods?
872514,grt1,2014-09-14 21:04:00,638,"they aren't really expensive rods, maybe around 100 bucks, definitely not in the price range of the top of the line rods that are available but I like them and would hate to throw them away because the guides are loose and twisting around."
872570,NANUK,2014-09-15 03:16:00,797,"Too bad you weren't closer Sir I could fix it up for you quickly.  I would ask are these expensive rods?  I wouldn't call it expensive, I bought it used from a member here, it is a custom rod, MHX blank with a st croix handle, I really like the action but the workmanship on all the guides is terrible. Like grt1, I hate to throw it away."
