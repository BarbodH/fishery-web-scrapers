871496,Reel Man,2014-09-09 09:13:00,80,"Just a quick prayer for a missing boater.  Ivan Batusic launched his 32 foot sailboat Friday afternoon from 50 Point Marina around 5pm.  Meant to be a short cruise and return around 7:30pm, not to be seen again.  Long time to be missing with a co-ordinated land, sea and air search ongoing.  Holding out hope for Ivan's sake and that of his loved ones that he will be found alive.  Thoughts and prayers are with you all."

I checked the news when I came in but did not see anything yet, 30 years of living here that plane flying in that mode usually means missing boater or plane down in the lake. SVS"
871528,Sinker,2014-09-09 13:31:00,8692,Geeze....that's a big boat to just disappear.  I hope he's ok.  S.
871541,Pickeral eater,2014-09-09 14:18:00,155,Saw the same plane flying very low over Jordan on my way to Hamilton on Saturday morning.  Just had a feeling that something had gone wrong

871600,Old Ironmaker,2014-09-09 20:26:00,8243,Lets just pray he sailed off into the sunset for whatever reason and is safe.
871636,Ralph Field,2014-09-09 23:18:00,1018,I believe they found the boat floating off Jordan harbour with no one aboard.
871639,Steve,2014-09-09 23:20:00,2075,boat found - no one aboard.  interviewed a friend and friend said this fella loved to go out to sail in rough water and was likely heading 'into' the storm...  i guess one could say he died doing what he loved....
871679,Old Ironmaker,2014-09-10 03:55:00,8243,A better way to go than most. On your own terms doing what you love.
871683,Reel Man,2014-09-10 06:11:00,80,"I guess we all gotta go sometime.  Might as well be doing something that you love.  Poor guy though, sympathy to the family."
