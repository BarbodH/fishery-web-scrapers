I've always targeted Largemouth so I have bunch of spots for that.  Not looking for specific spots of course, more general areas where you might get them. I don't have the means to run out to the main lake.  Thanks in advance."
872221,Steve,2014-09-13 02:12:00,2075,"we have always done well on the windblown side of trident point for smallies...sometimes as far out as the marker bouy.  in front of the cement plant, in picton bay, also has some great smallie fishing off the humps...we mark them when walleye fishing in the winter and hit them in the late summer...jerk baits mostly.  it's been a couple years since we did it...but those spots generally produced decent smallies.  Oh, on a walleye jigging trip with the G2 boys, we caught some nice smallies off green point on long reach...berkley gulp on jigheads for those."
