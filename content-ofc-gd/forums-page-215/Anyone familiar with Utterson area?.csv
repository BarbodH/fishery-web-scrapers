Decent fishing for LMB and some perch, though I mainly seem to catch bass there.  Had some great fun fishing bass on Fish Lake in Novar in the past.  Not looking for your ""honey holes"" , just looking for some general guidelines to expand my repertoire.  Limited of course by the fact that we don't have a boat (YET).  Looking to rectify that fact for next year though, so anyone looking to get rid of a light-weight tinny let me know! Thanks guys, and tight lines!"
