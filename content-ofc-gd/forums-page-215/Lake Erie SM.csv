I had planned to fish else where on Sunday,  but my brother has to help take down a venue at the homeshow,  so we figured let's try  Erie since the show is on the way home and were not heading out of our way or being rushed from our usual spots on gbay.  Thanks!"

The winds are forecast to be mild, I've seen that before too and we get blown off the lake by 10 AM. This will be our first fall Smallie hunt. It actually is the best time, yes we are in the middle of a cold front but I can't get any talking about it. And the water temps are dropping fast. When the wind is down we need to get out there.  The Pickerel seem to have left for the season. We were out for Walleye and didn't mark a thing but when we were going over a shoal we marked something. We circled back and found a good amount of baitfish and nice hooks on the edges at 20 feet. Of course we didn't have anything on board to get them, so set a waypoint and tomorrow it is. Too exited too sleep.Either Bass or Perch, I'll take either, even a farm animal for fun."
