871818,buick14,2014-09-10 21:22:00,741,Bah not gunna happen....
871819,misfish,2014-09-10 21:24:00,29133,Bah not gunna happen....  Thats what they said when the tornado went through Angus this year.
871820,outllaw,2014-09-10 21:52:00,1232,we have had app. 3 inches in 11/2 hours and more coming windsor
871821,cheaptackle,2014-09-10 22:00:00,849,And here we go again... Not even a week since the last one. Maybe that's why Hydro was taking down so many trees today along Hwy 12 between Atherly & Uptergrove - big ones!  Even had a huge crane in and closed the hwy for a while.  Or maybe they were practicing for tomorrow...  Michael
871826,misfish,2014-09-10 22:34:00,29133,"Michael  We seem to be getting a lot of this weather this year. I don,t recall seeing this kind  in the 25+ years living in Barrie.  When they say it,s coming, I take it seriously. No matter the out come."
871842,Joeytier,2014-09-10 23:34:00,3990,"Looks like we're in for 40-50 tonight plus potential for some boomers, then a weekend of nice cool weather for trout closer"
871844,Sinker,2014-09-10 23:55:00,8692,Bring it on! Nothing like a good storm!
871856,Freshtrax,2014-09-11 00:29:00,2215,never seen as much rain in an hour in canada as today......and i have water in my basement .....crap.   more work
871920,moxie,2014-09-11 11:00:00,1566,Its weather and it happens. Big woop.
871922,Rod Caster,2014-09-11 11:29:00,5784,Fall is nothing but a long term cold front. First frost this weekend?
871927,BillM,2014-09-11 12:20:00,17367,The Zalmons are coming!!!!!!!!!!!
871931,Steve,2014-09-11 13:07:00,2075,what a crazy year for weather ... again.  you guys don't want to know how much insurance costs are going to rise in the next couple years.....
871933,Pikeslayer,2014-09-11 13:24:00,1443,"On the plus side, fishing was on fire before the front moved in (zone 15). Never had a numbers day like yesterday in 90 minutes of fishing. On the down side, looks like I'll put the rods down for a couple of days while the fishies stabilize."
871934,BillM,2014-09-11 13:27:00,17367,what a crazy year for weather ... again.  you guys don't want to know how much insurance costs are going to rise in the next couple years.....  Look into your crystal ball and tell us!
871936,Steve,2014-09-11 13:34:00,2075,"I would expect home owner insurance to go up by approx 50% over the next three years.  this will be driven by sewer back up coverage.  i would expect auto insurance to go up by approx 10% over the next three years.  this will be driven by increased AB costs.  i would expect commercial insurance to increase by approx 40% over the next three years (or less).  commercial insurance is at an all time low, and can no longer be sustained. The increase might be even larger.  these increases will be across all insurance companies....  last year was record losses, this year is getting close.  no company is making any form of profit right now.  shareholders are losing their dividends....  in the past shopping around often allowed for savings....as all insurance companies are losing money, shopping around will only confirm that the prices offered will be consistent across all companies."
871938,AKRISONER,2014-09-11 13:42:00,5558,"yet apparently climate change isnt happening?  Whether its man made or not whatever...this weather is pretty wild, but being a weather nut its kind of interesting and fun to watch. I can also thank the ridiculous amount of rain we have had for filling GB back up so no complaints there!  I say keep on bringing the rain/snow etc etc  (and yes the ice storm did major damage, which included an insurance claim and me losing all of the mature trees in my yard)  Its mother nature, you are along for the ride weather (see what i did there) you like it or not."
871975,Raf,2014-09-11 17:15:00,3495, reminds me of enbridge this spring boohooing because of the harsh winter drying up their reserves and forcing them to buy at higher cost.  there are good years and there are bad years.
871976,Old Ironmaker,2014-09-11 17:26:00,8243,"I've seen worse, it rained hard and the wind blew?"
872088,Rod Caster,2014-09-12 10:34:00,5784,"Those rates will likely be seen at local levels more than anything. I doubt the Gov will allow major rate increases across the board.  The amound of weather-related claims up north isn't super high this year, if not a bit lower than normal."
872194,Steve,2014-09-12 23:03:00,2075,"government has no say in insurance prices, next to auto.  raf, shareholders only want one thing - profit."
