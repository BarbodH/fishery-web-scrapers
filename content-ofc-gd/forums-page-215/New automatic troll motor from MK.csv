871388,lew,2014-09-08 20:48:00,12766,"Came across this on another website, not my cup of tea but some may like the idea.  http://www.bassfan.com/reviews_article.asp?id=210"
871390,leaf4,2014-09-08 21:00:00,2466,sweet idea! but at that price point I would reeeaaallly hate to have to pay for out of warranty work on that at a price tag of up to $2549
871394,Terry,2014-09-08 21:13:00,14456,that's what I was going to say $2549.....wow
871403,leaf4,2014-09-08 21:42:00,2466,I think I could save money paying someone to drive me around while I fished lol
871407,mike rousseau,2014-09-08 21:50:00,4661,I guess this would be great news for anglers with physical limitations...
871428,davey buoy,2014-09-08 23:07:00,5505,"Pretty nice unit,but a little to rich for me.! I Can see them selling pretty well."
871436,xxgoaler,2014-09-08 23:56:00,106,You'll have one soon enough davey bouy
871441,misfish,2014-09-09 00:09:00,29133,"that's what I was going to say $2549.....wow  I,ll bet I,ll see that on the back of your toon next year.LOL"
871453,Can_38,2014-09-09 00:36:00,152,Closed bow boats would find these handy.  I wouldn't fork out that much coin but if I was given one I wouldn't say no.
871473,Steve,2014-09-09 01:41:00,2075,that'll break.  for sure.  it's a MK.  give it a few years before touching that one!
871487,leaf4,2014-09-09 02:46:00,2466,"if it does break, since it's fully automatic could you argue it broke itself and should therefore be covered under lifetime warranty??? hahaha if only"
871490,OhioFisherman,2014-09-09 03:49:00,6623,I seem to remember paying a lot less than that for a 20hp Merc in the 1960's new.  Heck my 1973 Dodge tradesman van was 3100 out the door new.
872116,limeyangler,2014-09-12 14:27:00,5204,"VERY NICEâ€¦..whats not to like?  Just hope you can also stow manually for when the glitchy i-pilot remote goes rangy, or any of the batteries in your system die while out on the water. Agree with others on the price, but would accept one as a gift without hesitation. My five year old son would love this too!"
872119,Lunkerhunter,2014-09-12 15:12:00,455,"cool idea, I would also agree that waiting a bit for the glitches to be sorted out is probably best.  I can see this being very useful for guides as they can now do everything from the touch of a button"
872132,Old Ironmaker,2014-09-12 17:30:00,8243,"Hey Ohio Buckeye, you are giving away your (my) age! I paid 1/2 that for my first Sears cartop and 9.9. We used to take it to school 15 miles each way or walk in the snow with cardboard shoes."
872138,OhioFisherman,2014-09-12 17:52:00,6623,"Hey Ohio Buckeye, you are giving away your (my) age! I paid 1/2 that for my first Sears cartop and 9.9.

872253,lunkerbasshunter,2014-09-13 14:41:00,2585,for that money I will pull the trolling motor up myself  Cheers
