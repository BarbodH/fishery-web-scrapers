When the three astonished men had settled down enough to speak, the first guy asked the angel humbly, “I’ve suffered from back pain ever since I took shrapnel in the WW1 … Could you Help me? “Of course,” the angel said, and when he touched the man’s back, the man felt relief for the first time in years. The second guy who wore very thick glasses and had a hard time reading and driving. He asked if the angel could do anything about his poor eyesight. The angel smiled, removed the man’s glasses and tossed them into the lake. When they hit the water, the man’s eyes cleared and he could see everything distinctly. When the angel turned to the third Newfie guy, the guy put his hands out defensively — “Don’t touch me!” he cried, “I’m on a disability pension.”"
