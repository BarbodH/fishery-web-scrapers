872017,JustinHoffman,2014-09-11 20:47:00,482,"Hello All,Put together a video this week showing some tips on how to photograph yourself - and your fish - when out in the boat solo.Perfect images and little to no stress on the fish...(watch in 1080p HD for best quality)Cheers,Justin"
872018,MJL,2014-09-11 21:02:00,2427,"Very nice Justin  The last few years I've been thinking of ways to photograph my catch with as little impact on the fish as possible. When it comes to selfies, one thing I like to use when I'm alone is an intervelometer type of remote like this:  http://www.photoglobeonline.com/aion-wireless-timer-remote-and-shutter-release.html  You can set the time, number of shots and interval between shots. It's plugged into the pre-trigger cable release socket and it will also focus in between shots automatically. At the end of the day you might have dozens of duplicates of similar shots but at least you know you'll have a pretty good chance of a keeper.  It also saves you from having to go back and forth to press the shutter.LOL"
872020,JustinHoffman,2014-09-11 21:09:00,482,"Good advice, MJL. Canon actually has a free app. that works as a remote right off your phone - this is only for the most recent of Canon cameras. I have yet to download it but I should, lol.  In some ways, I like that idea of only taking two shots with the set up I use. I know then that the fish is only out of the water for a maximum of 25 seconds and I use those two ten-second timers as a reminder/gauge. Remotes are definitely great, as long as folks remember the length of time that the fish has been out of the water for, and don't get too trigger happy and forget.....which I can see easily happening.  Cheers,  Justin  P.S. anything is better than the phone selfies, which undoubtedly cut off part of the fish - and generally the anglers head also, lol!"
872114,limeyangler,2014-09-12 14:19:00,5204,"Good stuff Justin, thanks for taking the time to post that. If you=dont mind me asking, what operating system and video editing software do you use?"
872115,BillM,2014-09-12 14:26:00,17367,"Justin in order to use that Canon app (EOS Remote), you'd need to setup your smartphone as a wifi hotspot...  Canon EOS remote only works over wifi for remote camera control."
872118,JustinHoffman,2014-09-12 14:57:00,482,"Limeyangler - I use a fairly basic and free editing software that came with the computer - Windows Movie Maker. Does a fairly decent job.  BillM - Good to know. Have only went so far as downloading the app. - had planned on giving it a try this weekend. Thanks for the heads up!  Cheers,  Justin"
872125,Mike Pike,2014-09-12 16:15:00,1332,"So what's wrong with taking a pic of the fish next to my boot!  lol  Good stuff Justin, and thank you for that."
872127,JustinHoffman,2014-09-12 16:46:00,482,"Haha, Mike. Well, depending on the size of your feet, it could work for....or against you...for catch comparison"
872128,captpierre,2014-09-12 17:08:00,2521,"still tricky with a 45 in ski.  a real fish, that is"
872129,JustinHoffman,2014-09-12 17:15:00,482,"Definitely, Pierre.  This was more for the bass, walleye and panfish folk out there. And I'll take a bass any day of the week over a 'ski, lol. But that's just me.  Cheers!"
872145,NewHips,2014-09-12 18:11:00,111,"I use a homemade rod holder, C clamp it to the front bow, use the extendable arm on my tripod with a quick realease (with ball-head swivel) 20 sec. timer.I keep the fish in the water, either net or still with a single hook lure still attached to his mouth. I find the hardest part is the focus, I try to focus on the motor or approximately where I'll be standing. I would never trust a tripod in open water and lose a $1000 camera. Thanks for the great tips..........."
872175,Old Ironmaker,2014-09-12 20:36:00,8243,"Good stuff Justin. You look very comfortable in front of the camera, something that can't be taught. I did a few very boring industrial Health and Safety videos. The director would cut and reshoot if I said "" uuum"". You might want to work on that. Otherwise great work."
872257,lunkerbasshunter,2014-09-13 14:51:00,2585,great tips!  cheers

Thanks for the great tips...........  Get a remote, you'll be able to lose the 20 sec delay and also you'll have zero focus issues."

872360,AdamS,2014-09-14 00:43:00,161,Nice video.   very informative. I'll have to keep those tips in mind next time I'm out.
