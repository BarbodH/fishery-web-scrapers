We spent the whole day Tuesday and 4 hours on Wednesday and managed 60 fish over the 2 days it was awesome!  Spinners and plastics for the most part, the Smally's were a little skiddish at hitting but the Pike and Largemouth were just slamming everything!  Biggest Smally was 3.9 lbs and the big Largemouth in the third pic weighed in at 4.6.  None of the fish were chunked up yet, all pretty skinny which honestly made for some epic jumping and fights!  Everything was released.  Heres a few pics..."
871956,thegrumpyfisherman,2014-09-11 15:55:00,59,I had two more pics but apparently it limits what I can post

871963,SmokestackLightnin,2014-09-11 16:29:00,390,You don't look very grumpy.
871966,thegrumpyfisherman,2014-09-11 16:38:00,59,"lol no everything was going well you got me Smoke.  and sorry for the 3 posts this forum has some quirks I am still learning, like apparently I can't delete my own post, they limit how many pics you can upload and they won't let you use flickr.  Slightly annoying but got it now."
872105,BillM,2014-09-12 13:06:00,17367,"Nice fish!  Heading up that way Sunday, hopefully the weather is decent."
872108,moxie,2014-09-12 13:33:00,1566,You don't look very grumpy. hehehe.
872124,Tim Mills,2014-09-12 15:45:00,476,"Nice mix of SM and LM, I fished Lake Joe in mid august in the Yoho Island area.  Lots of small fish and a couple of decent ones around 3.5lbs.  Some guys were trolling and catching Lake Trout in the area as well."
872130,thegrumpyfisherman,2014-09-12 17:18:00,59,"I was at the same lake as above on Sunday, and managed 8 fish in 12 hours.  2 days later after all the cottagers had gone home it was like someone had come by and air dropped fish into the water.  I'm left assuming the boat noise and activity is part of what makes them inactive..??"
872134,BillM,2014-09-12 17:36:00,17367,"I dunno, I've had some banner days out on the water with jetskis and boats zipping around."
872135,thegrumpyfisherman,2014-09-12 17:40:00,59,"I dunno, I've had some banner days out on the water with jetskis and boats zipping around.  Ya me too I guess, was just trying to figure out why such a huge difference in 2 days.  I'm far from an expert so perhaps I just wasn't employing the right tactic Sunday for where they were.  They seemed to be out in 20 feet Sunday whereas Tues and Weds they were in schools around docks and on weed edges.  Whatever the case it was a great couple days of action!"
872136,BillM,2014-09-12 17:46:00,17367,Most likely the weather
872256,lunkerbasshunter,2014-09-13 14:46:00,2585,nice looking sm and lm you got there  cheers
872357,fishingnerd,2014-09-14 00:18:00,1,Any chance for shore fishing in Lake Simcoe? And tip on some hotspots?
872407,KraTToR,2014-09-14 12:25:00,506,Nice fish!  I was at Rosseau for a w/e with my wife and I ended up boating 2 pike one afternoon. the 2nd was a personal best of over 30lbs.  Actually I caught both while drop-shotting for Bass with a yellow grub.  What's in the Muskoka lakes? Is there any walleye or just Bass and Pike?  TIA
872417,Raf,2014-09-14 13:05:00,3495,there's a few walleye in some of the lakes and lake trout.
872428,thegrumpyfisherman,2014-09-14 14:12:00,59,"Any chance for shore fishing in Lake Simcoe? And tip on some hotspots?  That would probably be the worst lake to try shore fishing on if there is, drive an extra hour North and cruise the backroads North of Honey Harbour you could probaby find somewhere far quieter where you may even catch some fish!"
872445,cram,2014-09-14 15:32:00,1733,Nice fish.  Congrats.
