867753,jimmer,2014-08-15 15:08:00,2730,"It's a very clear lake and tough to fish with high light conditions. Try around the shoal in the centre of the lake, it seems to be the best structure. You might have better luck after dark."
867774,Cosmos,2014-08-15 18:04:00,588,Thank you
867775,dave524,2014-08-15 18:05:00,4508,"Have a look here,  several of us weighed in on this area a while back.  http://ontariofishingcommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=61167&hl=dudmon&do=findComment&comment=675494"
867942,Cosmos,2014-08-16 22:25:00,588,"Guys, thank you for information. I made my trip to loon lake today. Weather was not nice, but I still had a lot of fine catching smallies - nothing big though. Lost walleye close to the boat around 6 30 am in the morning."
867949,Entropy,2014-08-16 23:47:00,747,That lake brings back some good memories.  Glad you enjoyed.
867952,dave524,2014-08-16 23:54:00,4508,"That lake brings back some good memories.  Glad you enjoyed.  Same here  , spent about 25 summers on that lake when my parents had a place there."
872602,Cosmos,2014-09-15 14:05:00,588,"Made another trip yesterday. NO walleye or trout to be found. Got some smallies again, couple good ones.  I think I have to look for another lake with walleyes. If anyone can give me an advice in that area I would really appreciate it. Thank you"
872611,dave524,2014-09-15 14:33:00,4508,"In my 20 some years on that lake, Walleye were basically a low or no light light target species, north end of the mid lake ridge was by far the best spot. You might want to try Barnum Lake just on the basis of the recent stocking, it is fairly close by.  http://www.hhoa.on.ca/uploads/1/4/2/0/14209292/2013_mindenfishstockinglist-2013-12-17.pdf   Edit: I see they are no longer stocking Beanpole or Coburn with splake or rainblows due to access issues, man   dad and I spent some great time on those 2 lakes daytripping."
872613,jimmer,2014-09-15 14:38:00,2730,"Wow, I never saw smallies like that when I was there. Great catch. I still believe that the clarity of the waters in Haliburton has an impact on walleye success."
