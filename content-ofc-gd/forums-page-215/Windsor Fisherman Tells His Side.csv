872074,landry,2014-09-12 03:50:00,1005,He deserves it. He should not be harmed or threatened but he should be shamed. It's not blown out of proportion. The only people beating this to death and getting enraged are online fisherman like ourselves. This issue matters to me. It sounds like this act was indicative if his true nature and typical behavior.
872078,mike rousseau,2014-09-12 05:06:00,4661,"I think it's great the video was posted... Brings awareness to others not to act like this...  And if the MNR didn't get flooded with emails over this video do you think this man would have been fined?  I don't  Now the MNR is in the hot seat to make an example of this ""man"" to calm the public's outrage...  This was an illigal kill... No matter how you slice it... It wasn't a poor slot measurement... Or a FMZ border confusion... Or improper fish ID... He intentionally killed a fish with no intent to keep it...  And I do agree... Wishing harm on anyone is out of line... I only hope he is punished accordingly by fine and maybe license suspension or something... He obviously doesn't respect the law or the efforts put in by others to maintain the fishery..."

This poacher, and that is what he is, has the mentality to drive while under suspension for a DUI, drunk. He will not rehabilitate. OK, I have my say I'm done with this. Thanks for putting up with the rants."

If he indeed changes his ways, and other like this get the point that they do not live in their own personal jurisdictions, then I'm glad this all went down like it did. Those who are hating the public lynching are just hipstering hipster or devil's advocating the devil's advocate. Get over it, this was for the greater good and is a public lesson."

I will agree with your point in wishing those who have committed real awful crimes(against other humans) were made to suffer this type of justice considering the farce that is, for the most part the so called justice system.

My only beef was with how everyone quotes he broke the ""law"" over and over and over, but somehow the punishment prescribed by that same law isn't enough, and that he needs endless threats, humiliation and infamy as well.  Let him be fined by the ministry.  You can't have your cake and eat it too, though apparently everyone seems to think otherwise.  Abiding by the law also means let the law deal with the punishment.  If you think that's not enough write your MPP and get the punishment upped, but stop with the drama already, it's a fish.  Last post I'm done."

How about this for a headline to get the public to outcry, "" Haldimand man charged for clubbing 8 week old puppy to death then throwing it into lake""  The man said he did it because they crapped all over the place. It was the first time he did this he was heard when applogizing"".  It's called public outcry, Google Ray Rice, NFL."
872153,landry,2014-09-12 19:30:00,1005,Grumpy. I get your point. Keep our comments and wishes reasonable. He should be fined and suspended to the max allowable for this - nothing more. I vote for lifetime suspension if it can be proven that he is a repeat offender but he may still keep hunting and fishing anyways. This event will likely not change his behavior but it may at least put him on the MNRs radar and send a message to others.

Two storys in a city newspaper, likely thousands of death threats, discussions and postings all over the internet that can never be removed, and where does it end?  Maybe his boss sees it and decides he needs to be removed?  Maybe his family disowns him?  Maybe he gets spit on in the street?  I condone the fine, the rest to me is disgusting for killing one fish.  And I will add that I don't even kill for eating, legal or not that annoys me as well.

Yes it's just 1 small fish, if he did the same to a fluffy puppy or kitten wow then you would have the world at his doorstep for certain. It is 2014 not 1914, social media is a powerful thing and whether I like it or not, and I don't, it's here and here to stay.
