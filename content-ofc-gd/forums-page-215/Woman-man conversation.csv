Man: $5.00 which includes a tip (This is where it gets scary !)  Woman: And how long have you been drinking?  Man: About 20 years, I suppose  Woman: So a beer costs $5 and you have 3 beers a day which puts your spending each month at $450. In one year, it would be approximately $5400 ...correct?

Man: Correct  Woman: Do you know that if you didn't drink so much beer, that money could have been put in a compound interest savings account and after accounting for compound interest for the past 20 years, you could have now bought a Ferrari?  Man: Do you drink beer?  Woman: No   Man: Where's your ""blanking"" Ferrari? "

I don't think she's coming back."""
