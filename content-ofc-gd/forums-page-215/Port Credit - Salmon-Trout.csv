I'm planing on heading to Port Credit in the coming days - question, has anyone been down there yet? Just wondering if the fish are stacking up prepping to head up river or is it still too early?...I don't expect any ""hot spots"" (I frequent the place myself - or at least I used to, back when I lived in Mississauga).  PS: I'll be fishing from shore.  Thanks in Advance, A2F (Rob)"

871721,LeXXington,2014-09-10 15:27:00,1928,"Its hit and miss right now, Sunday AM they were all stacked at the mouth then the wind and waves changed and they were gone.  Standing room only casting spoons."

872250,BillM,2014-09-13 14:35:00,17367,With all this rain you better get out there to pick up the stragglers or else they'll be long gone.  Don't wait around for internet reports.
