872241,Locnar,2014-09-13 13:48:00,645,"With this sudden drop of temperatures, what sort of effect do you guys foresee on fishing tonight/tomorrow? I'm goin' for bass and maybe pickerel. Do you guys have any go-to technique for this kind of weather change? I'm thinking something along the lines of slow and bouncing off the bottom?"
872242,Tim Mills,2014-09-13 13:54:00,476,"Slower presentations, plastics and live bait."
872243,mattaw,2014-09-13 13:58:00,162,"You would think that, but the pike have really heated up for me, getting nice size on swimbaits that are moving pretty quickly. Bass on the otherhand, SLOW as Tim said, the slower the better, they're there, you just have to work for them."
872244,xxgoaler,2014-09-13 14:10:00,106,"Have found the bass have been shut down for over a week, Pike should start to come into the bays shortly"
872245,Pikeslayer,2014-09-13 14:12:00,1443,"Here in zone 15, the cold front moved in Thursday afternoon. Fish were back on the feed by 11:00 am yesterday. We are getting big numbers of Pike & Bass on live bait & swim baits. No need for slow presentation here, they are very aggressive despite the weather."
872246,BillM,2014-09-13 14:28:00,17367,I find that when things start to cool off the in the fall the fish will move shallower (Especially those big snakes)..  I catch bass on topwater right until the end of Oct/start of Nov if the weather is decent.
872248,mike rousseau,2014-09-13 14:31:00,4661,Usually just have to work harder to get em off the same spots you've been catching on...  I personally fish fast till I find some active fish then work em over... Slow down... Try different baits... Etc...  Not all the fish will be shut down... Just gotta find some that wanna play...

872272,lunkerbasshunter,2014-09-13 15:36:00,2585,I find the change helps fishing this time of year.  Cheers
872280,Jitterbug,2014-09-13 17:09:00,7,"I was fishing at the forks of the thames river in London yesturday, and i caught a personal best channel cat coming in at 9lbs! It seems like the cold weather is stirring up a feeding frenzy cause every fish i caught had a massive tummy on them. We also had a ton of rain around here as well the river is up at least 2ft"
872342,BassMan11,2014-09-13 23:16:00,583,I sure hope it turns them on. Heading to nakina on Monday! Big gators in shallow will be awesome.
