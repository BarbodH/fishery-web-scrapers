871550,Sebastian,2014-09-09 15:07:00,208,Hey guys. Im looking to buy another Terrova with ipilot for my new boat. I put a 101lbs thrust Terrova 36V on my last Lund Explorer 1700 SC. It worked awesome. My new boat is an almost 18' (much deeper)Starcraft Superfisherman with dual windshield. I dont want to add a 3rd battery so im looking at a 80lbs thrust to stay at 24V. My boat will catch a lot of wind because its high out of the water with dual windshield. I dont want to be blown off the spot lock feature because the motor isnt powerful enough. Anyone have a 80lbs Terrova i pilot on a big deep 17-19 footer? How does it perform in 20-30km winds?

871581,RickOnt,2014-09-09 18:14:00,669,"I have been using the Terrova, 24Volt, 80 lb thrust with a 60 ""shaft,with I-pilot,  on a Sylvan, 17' 4"" Full windshield  No issues with wind, whatsoever.  I am using the stock prop,  But I think I will check into the 3 blade Bill suggestedj  However if you are out on some bigger water and get 3 foot waves the prop will lift out of the water,  But that will happen with any bow mount.  At that time its no fun anyway and I head for some leeward shoreline"
871585,Spanky80,2014-09-09 18:25:00,152,"I have the Terrova 80 lb 24v on a Stratos 285XL DC, which is 18'6"" and heavy, and I have had no issues, nor would I go with a stronger electric if I did it over again.  I generally run out of freeboard (waves) before the wind becomes an issue with motor power..."

871659,Sebastian,2014-09-10 02:00:00,208,Awesome. Thanks guys. I won be getting the i-link. I use Lowrance HDS units.

I'd say go for the 36 volt and move on.
