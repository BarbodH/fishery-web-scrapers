We launched for 8am and noticed water temps at 58 degrees!!! Holy heck.Starting at a spot not far from the launch we noticed hundreds of shiners breaking the surface all over the place...but strangely enough, there weren't any fish busting on them. We continued and it started to rain.I'm not sure what the air temp was, but we could see our breath. We were working milfoil edges that broke into 6' to 8' of water. Winds started to pick up...We moved to a rocky shoal that extended from an island with deep water on both sides...milfoil patches throughout. Very Sexy!! Well, the sexy produced a sexy bass!!!   We fished well into the afternoon...and picked away at fish here and there. Hirk caught a fat beautiful smallie which provided a great aerial display.  We called it a day around 5pm. I can't say enough how enjoyable the day was. Glad I noticed the invite - great way to spend a day. Wishing you luck in your tourney tomorrow Hirk! Thanks again."
