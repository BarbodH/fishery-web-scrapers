872435,Dave Bailey,2014-09-14 15:10:00,1641,"There is a general rule among Toronto area astronomers: If there's something neat going on, Toronto will be clouded out. I can remember, years ago, the Toronto chapter of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada checked the records of weather and astronomical events, and the number of cloud-outs here was well above random chance. I'm not implying some sort of supernatural malevolence, but I don't bother getting excited any more."
