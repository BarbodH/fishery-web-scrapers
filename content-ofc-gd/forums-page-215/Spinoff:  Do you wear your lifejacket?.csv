Just imagine it they had one on before they fell in.  On or not, getting back into medium to small boats can bring the gunwales close to the water's edge and then maybe the boat swamps and 2 or more people are in the water.  I've done white water canoe courses and lifeguard courses and survival courses. I've done the water rescues from shore, from canoes, kayaks, tin boats and great lakes sized ones. It's hard enough when you are in shape, young (and in a group that is more comfortable then the average person in the water to begin with) and in no real danger do to the controlled environment.

I can count on one hand the number of times I've ever had one on.   I'm just not one to put myself in a situation where it will ever be needed (ie the guy in the 9ft dingy out 5 miles on Simcoe jigging in 3ft rollers)..   The last time I had one on was a few years ago on Lake Nipigon, before that Lake Superior many years ago.  I know I'm not alone as 95% of the people I see out on the water aren't wearing them either     I'm sure this is going to turn into a crap fest but I'd at least like to see a few reasons from the other guys that spend a lot of time on the water.  Since I bought my mustang auto inflatable, I wear it most of the time.  All of the time if i'm alone."

Thank you Mike, you just made me feel a lot better! I hope it is never needed but look at what happened last year when some of our own members found themselves in the water. It all happened in seconds and there was no time to grab a pfd and put it on.

The auto inflate ones activate when submerged in water so they work just like a regular PFD. The big advantage of the inflatables is that they are so comfortable you often forget you even have them on."

Happened to me last year actually. I had caught a hook in the mesh of my inflatable, I took it off and hung it on a seat. I put on a spare vest. During the safety check by the OPP it was explained to me and the 2nd young cop took the hook out for me, that's good service."

As it turns out now many of the people I fish with now, except for my brother, can't swim.

Sometimes though circumstances dictate that things end up otherwise and something goes wrong.

I say 99.9 because I forgot mine in the truck once in the last 5 years and actually made me feel anxious and naked without it. I admit I didn't put on the 1 of 3 others on board but put in on the back of my seat. Why, I can't really explain. I tried to copy and paste my response to the other thread but can not. ( windows explorer is the problem , thanks Art) I am implementing the new Johnny Law on my boat that is used on Big old Erie 99% of the time. It is no jacket no boat ride or fishing. Simple as that. I hear a few excuses why jackets aren't worn by people here and in the real world. They are basically all ridiculous from I can swim well, I'll wear one when it's dangerous to it isn't comfortable. I will say I don't know anyone exept Analeese Carr that can swim on Erie through 6 foot waves into the current against the undertow. When is it dangerous, unless you can breath underwater anytime in a boat can be dangerous, even on glass like water. All alone, fall overboard in 45F water, you are done. Can't happen? Odds are it might not but  I know guys with previous heart conditions that fish alone, how about a healthy person tripping on the anchor rope or the butt chair comes out of the holder because that rope released it? I saw a fellow OFC member have it happen to 2 years ago.  Mike Borger, that video was us making rapid runs numerous times a day on the Ottawa downstream of Westmeath when the Blast Furnace boys went up there more than a few times a year, still do. Life jackets always on."

Beautiful shot, a far horizon and glass smooth water. The  Tourism ministry complained that he wasn't wearing a jacket! Did not want to replace the shot  so off I went and bought a life vest with the foam inside, beautiful adjustable and even as pockets, like a fishing vest ; shot it and photoshopped it on the guy's back:) Everyone happy!

Case in point, two springs ago in late April, two fishing colleagues were slow trolling for rainbows in calm water conditions. The guy in the front (facing the driver) reached to his left and promptly slid across the frosted seat. The weight of both guys on the same side of the 12 foot tinny was enough that they both got dumped into the lake (water temp was 5 C). They were both wearing PFDs but they were very fortunate that another boat was within 50 meters and those two guys helped get my colleagues out of the water.

Last year in the wind I was almost knock out of the boat fishing in the early spring in rough water. It would have been a tough swim to catch up to the boat and get back in with the 3ft waves. I was wet before I regained my balance.
871857,i2cool2fool,2014-09-11 00:34:00,349,"My personal rules are simple and they work for me. Maybe not you. Doesn't matter. Each their own.  1) wear my inflatable always else a PFD if things get tricky, exception 2) when on big water (Erie) regardless of depth, range from shore or weather conditions, PFD is on. Don't care how hot the summer day gets. I am happy clam to be fishing while making a fashion statement. 3) if you're in my boat, you wear my PDF or the one you brought with you."
871736,BillM,2014-09-10 16:56:00,17367,"I didn't want to hijack the PFD thread, but I thought a few of the responses were interesting.   I never wear one, unless the conditions call for it.  I can count on one hand the number of times I've ever had one on.   I'm just not one to put myself in a situation where it will ever be needed (ie the guy in the 9ft dingy out 5 miles on Simcoe jigging in 3ft rollers)..   The last time I had one on was a few years ago on Lake Nipigon, before that Lake Superior many years ago.  I know I'm not alone as 95% of the people I see out on the water aren't wearing them either     I'm sure this is going to turn into a crap fest but I'd at least like to see a few reasons from the other guys that spend a lot of time on the water."
871737,adempsey,2014-09-10 17:06:00,1498,"Yes.   The one I own doesn't interfere or bother me so I wear it.   It's a standard PFD, not an inflatable.  What prompted me was the realization that I am not as good a swimmer as I once was."
871738,mike rousseau,2014-09-10 17:09:00,4661,Never wear it... Only time I've ever worn mine in my boat was so my kid would wear his...  Buddy has a bass boat that does 60mph... We wear em when we are running... Makes sense...
871739,Garnet,2014-09-10 17:13:00,2056,I wear my auto inflate 100 % if I'm fishing alone and about 50/50 with other people. My balance is not great anymore.  In my tournament days I've had some hair raising boat rides. Did a 180 off a wave in big bay one time my tournament partner was on the floor. Happy tournament rules make you wear lifejackets.
871742,Wagoneer,2014-09-10 17:17:00,118," Doesn't matter the size of your boat. A PFD isn't just for capsizing. You can slip on your deck and hit your head on the way down and drown in 3' of water before you get out of the marina.  I have emergency training and have been thrown into some hairy situations for said training. Take somebody's word for it who's been through that stuff, wear a PFD. I have that training and still wear one. Everybody who comes on my boat wears one, even my dogs."
871743,bigcreekdad,2014-09-10 17:19:00,546,"I never do. However, I'm closer to 70 than 60 now, and I plan to wear one when fishing by myself in Canada."
871745,BillM,2014-09-10 17:20:00,17367,"I wear my auto inflate 100 % if I'm fishing alone and about 50/50 with other people. My balance is not great anymore.

You bass boat guys are nuts.  If I was hauling ass across the lake at 70mph, I'd have mine on as well, lol!"
871748,AKRISONER,2014-09-10 17:28:00,5558,"I wear mine when i head out in the tinner because the thing is not stable due to its size. Ive nearly flipped it over backwards hitting a wave and catching a gust of wind at the same time so i dont trust it very much.  Aside from that my dad and i always wear them in the late fall or early spring where swimming wouldnt be an option even if wed like it to be. Having worked on the docks with the ice on the lake, i know that attempting to swim anywhere in that kind of water means that you are going to drown. Aside from that I never wear them on the 26 footer because if you ever fell out that boat, you are probably dead anyways."
871749,mistaredone,2014-09-10 17:33:00,913,"I only wear mine when I have my kids on the boat, water is below 60 or bad weather"
871750,chris.brock,2014-09-10 17:34:00,4053,"I only wear it in two situations, running rapids, or when I'm a little cold and need extra insulation"
871751,Sebastian,2014-09-10 17:35:00,208,I use to never wear it but i began wearing it now when running from spot to spot especially on a new body of water.
871754,Rod Caster,2014-09-10 17:42:00,5784,"I'm not a boat rat, so I get uncomfortable in boats sometimes. When that happens I wear it. I also wear it in the canoe if the conditions call for it or sometimes I put it on and forget. I bought a nice PFD so if it's on at the beginning of the day, it usually stays on by default."
871758,MJL,2014-09-10 17:56:00,2427,I wear one 100% of the time when I'm in a boat - Toronto Island Ferry was the only exception. I grew up wearing one as a kid in my uncle's canoe and feel naked on the water without one - kind of like wearing a seat belt in a car.  I got the chance to try one of the inflatable life jackets on my trip to BC a few weeks ago. Really like how light and comfortable they are.
871760,mistyriver1,2014-09-10 18:00:00,600,"If I am by myself fishing, I will wear mine en route to a spot.  Once there I take it off.  If i have others with me, I do not.  Great thread."
871761,lew,2014-09-10 18:06:00,12766,Never wore a jacket until a few years back when I was alone in my boat on Nipissing in very rough water. I looked around and there wasn't a boat or cabin in sight and I figured if I got tossed overboard I could be in some serious doo doo. I put one on and now always wear an auto inflating Mustang when I'm alone in the boat and sometimes when I've got company too.  I also clip on the kill switch lanyard when I'm running fast and that's something else I never used to do.  We really do get wiser as we get older.  They bring some pretty good luck too  
871762,LeXXington,2014-09-10 18:11:00,1928,I am a super strong swimmer but still  I got in the habit a bunch of years ago of always wearing my life jacket on open water (regular type) even with people on the boat.  My kids now see me always put it on and they follow the lead.
871763,aplumma,2014-09-10 18:16:00,6896,"Only on cold water, isolated places or going faster than 50 mph.   Art"
871768,Dan668,2014-09-10 18:43:00,1120,Only when running on a bass boat.  Dont bother otherwise.
871772,creditmaster,2014-09-10 19:00:00,190,i only wear an auto inflate when im  fishing for steelhead . in the frigid and  fast spring and fall water
871773,Garnet,2014-09-10 19:01:00,2056,70 mph bass boats are fun and comfortable.  All that goes away when you get in the big stuff. Then it's just survival.  Was out surfing big rollers on Georgian Bay. My tournament partner at 6-4 yells stop stop. Jumps up gets his life jacket on lights a dart and off we go. He is a big time TV fishing host  now. That day just happy to get back so we could dry out the life jackets.

871785,BillM,2014-09-10 19:30:00,17367,"That was awesome.   Also, I forgot about the time we came back from that back lake in Algonquin in those giant waves    Lifejacket was definitely on for that little ride."

Also, I forgot about the time we came back from that back lake in Algonquin in those giant waves    Lifejacket was definitely on for that little ride.  The only reason I wasn't wearing mine was because I left it at the end of the portage. I think that was the most scared I've ever been in a canoe."
871788,captpierre,2014-09-10 19:35:00,2521,Don't wear them but they are close by.  BTW. Is it true that kids must wear one in a boat?  To what age?
