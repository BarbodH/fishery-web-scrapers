868792,adam lancia,2014-08-22 12:14:00,234,"Hi all, I bought a Rapala Vapor spinning reel last summer and now the knob on the handle is very difficult to turn. The knob is riveted onto the handle on both sides so I can't even service it or replace the bushings in the knob. I sent Rapala an email through their Canadian site, has anyone else contacted them this way and had any success? Would I be better off calling them? Lastly, does anyone know if there is another handle assembly that will fit and has replaceable bushings/bearings...? Thanks in advance!"
868808,mike rousseau,2014-08-22 13:42:00,4661,I have contacted them through email...  They did get back to me...  They were not helpful AT ALL...  Very disappointed with the replies I got from them...
868811,4x4bassin,2014-08-22 14:09:00,1025,I have had good dealings with them over the phone several years ago mind you . I had a new lure break and they replaced it no questions asked !!!
868828,mike rousseau,2014-08-22 16:33:00,4661,I was asked to ship my lures (about 12) that fell apart under normal use in 1 season... At my cost...  When I asked if I would be getting ANY replacements to justify me spending my money to ship their faulty lures (only 1 color had an issue) their reply was we need to see the lures...  I sent pics...  They still insisted I ship them...  All I wanted them to say was they'd give me at least 1 lure to pay for my shipping... I don't think that was too much to ask...
868841,hoby5,2014-08-22 18:11:00,42,Could not agree more Mike they gave me the worst customer service ive ever encountered. I will never buy another rapala product again.
868843,Steve,2014-08-22 18:28:00,2075,only real issues i've had with rapala (outside of their garbage rods and reels) is the tail dancers paint chipping off...  didn't get any resolution to that issue.
868846,Sinker,2014-08-22 19:21:00,8692,"I""ve had taildancers replaced that the lips pulled off of no questions asked, but I took them right to rapala in oshawa.  S."
868851,Steve,2014-08-22 20:02:00,2075,"ya, one of my TD's had the lip come off as well....  strange thing was I was fishing 100+' of water at Quinte....no way it hit bottom....  just reeled in the lip still attached to my line, without a lure attached."
868865,adam lancia,2014-08-22 21:20:00,234,"I was able to speak to someone on the phone this morning. Basically, they're not sure which handles interchange between reels so the best they can do is replace the whole reel as a final warranty replacement, which I don't need. So, can anyone think of an easy way to drill the head from the rivet that is in the place where a screw head usually is? I feel like I should be able to then drill and tap the rivet and replace the bushings, freeing things up. Ideas? Opinions? Thanks in advance!"
868873,Locnar,2014-08-22 22:04:00,645,"I contacted them via phone... to place an order for a replacement handle for my ice auger. No problems, but no extra help. Just sold me the part and sent it within a few days."
868874,Fisherpete,2014-08-22 22:16:00,1814,"I've been to their location in Oshawa three times, two for broken rods and one for a broken reel. All three times in and out no problems with new gear. The guy even took the spool off my broken reel and gave it to me as a spare without me asking!  Why not just get a new reel if they offered?"
868875,Fisherpete,2014-08-22 22:18:00,1814,"Here's their phone number and address if you need it.  (905) 571-3001  1350 Phillip Murray, Oshawa, ON L1J 6Z9"
868910,AdamS,2014-08-23 04:11:00,161,Why not just get a new reel if they offered? I wondered the same thing. I think you only get 1 year warranty with them and if it was last summer you bought it your around the end of your warranty. so why not take the new one?
868911,Gerritt,2014-08-23 06:02:00,6129,Yup dealt with them for the same issue as mentioned tail dancer lips separating while on vacation lost 4 lures.... Nothing but the lip left. When I received an email back from them they also included their general council in the reply.. Needless to say they were not going to help me.  It was then I decided I would avoid buying their products as much as possible.  G
868915,outllaw,2014-08-23 09:47:00,1232,in bizness you should never forget where you came from. rapala has seemed to achieved that.
868936,adam lancia,2014-08-23 16:33:00,234,"You make a good point Adam. I guess I could jsut tackle this same bridge when I cross it again next summer. Maybe by then I'll know which handle I can interchange it with, LOL"
869087,farsider,2014-08-24 15:40:00,456,"If it is convenient to stop into their place in Oshawa, do it.  Otherwise, the response/outcome is pathetic at best.  They don't make 'em like they used to (and other applicable cliches...).  Cheers, Mark"
872576,adam lancia,2014-09-15 11:19:00,234,"Update: along with calling Rapala/Normark, I filled out their online contact form and actually got an email back a little over a week ago asking for a shipping address. They sent me a replacement handle assembly free of charge. I was really pleasantly surprised by this, not only because they sent me parts at no cost to me, but also because I forgot that I had contacted them through their website. Saved me a trip to Oshawa and I get to tray and modify the original binding handle assembly."
872640,Steve,2014-09-15 18:31:00,2075,very good to hear!!
