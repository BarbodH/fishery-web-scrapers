872562,Regan Thompson,2014-09-15 01:52:00,80,"Nothing wrong with St. Clair that's for sure, but another thought, If you want to stay in the 3-4 hour drive Radius try Severn Sound Gbay (absolute killer Muskie fishery and great walleye and bass too!).  The only decent place to stay is Musky's landing (although it's kind of close to the highway).  The scenery is much better on Severn compared to anything in the Kawartha's or St. Clair too.  I used to live on the Kawarthas, if you go there I'd recommend Pigeon, Sturgeon, Balsam or even Rice Lake for what your looking for."
872578,BillM,2014-09-15 11:55:00,17367,"I wouldn't tell someone who's not a seasoned muskie guy to hit Gbay..  Sure there are monsters, but the fish are few and far between.  If you want numbers, hit the Kawarthas."
872583,Wagoneer,2014-09-15 12:14:00,118,"Lake Erie has been really frustrating the last couple years around long point. Both bass and pike have been really hard to locate we've found. The last two years we haven't caught anything to write home about. Quantity is sometimes there on a good day, but size is defintely not. Not sure what's been up, but all the pike i've caught in the last two years have been REALLY skinny. Fish just aren't where they usually are, probably because of the cold summer this year. The smallies should be stacking by now, and the we haven't been able to hit any schools at all in our usual go-to places.  I've been going to lake st. clair more and more this summer and while I haven't gotten into any big musky yet, I've boated some really nice nickel smallies. I keep going out of mitchell's bay for some reasons, but planning on making some trips out of belle river this fall and spend some more time musky hunting. I've had a lot more fun fishing LSC this year than I have fishing the inner bay / long point of erie.  If you're up for the drive nippissing is always a good choice. Even if you get skunked on that lake the shorelines are so beautiful you don't care."
872595,Shloim,2014-09-15 13:18:00,515,"Trent Severn area around Gloucester pool, many species, often no trophies but all day non stop action!"
872343,KraTToR,2014-09-13 23:25:00,506,"What do you guys think is the best fishing within 3-4 hours of KW?  I'm looking for weekend walleye, bass, and muskie destinations.   Thoughts?  Patrick."
872352,spincast,2014-09-13 23:57:00,3279,St clair
872354,PikeyArea,2014-09-14 00:09:00,19,If you're going to Kawarthas Lower Buckhorn is usually better than Stoney. If you're going to Bay of Q its much better near Picton than it is Belleville or Trenton and that's pretty far from KW. Honestly the only thing I don't like about living in KW is the terrible drive for a decent place to fish. But I would agree and say St. John or really most of Simcoe if you don't mind the big lake. And if you're willing to drive four hours you could probably make most of the lakes around Parry Sound and they're all good.
872361,sofabed,2014-09-14 00:54:00,119,I live in the KW area as well. great area to live except for water unless you like big water like Erie. I go to the Kawartha lakes as the drive is better if you take the 407. You also don't have to worry about weather as much with small lakes like Lower Buckhorn or Sturgeon.
872371,Musky or Specks,2014-09-14 02:03:00,2710,Go 4 hrs what's the diff. Restoule is my choice
872375,Beavertail,2014-09-14 02:25:00,331,"Yeah, living in KW can be kinda frustrating as far as fishing is concerned...right in the middle of everything but not really close to anything. Maybe not what you're looking for, but we are close to some great river systems."
872377,bow slayer,2014-09-14 03:07:00,1074,"st.clair,great musky and walleye fishing,bass is ok also     honey harbour,moon river or anywhere on georgian bay,or the kawarthas is easily within 3 from KW"
872378,Steve,2014-09-14 03:11:00,2075,st clair for sure.  world class muskie and smallies...with strong walleye fishing as well.
872379,crappieperchhunter,2014-09-14 03:33:00,2582,I grew up in Fergus but moved away in 83. Used to be tons of good smallie river action in the area. Lots of small creeks loaded with Specs and the Grand had just been infused with Browns as well. Caught tons on Pike in Lake Belwood and in the Grand as well. I hear Belwood has a healthy population of Eyes now too...but I can't confirm that.  I think you just have to get out and explore.

872402,KraTToR,2014-09-14 12:16:00,506,"st.clair,great musky and walleye fishing,bass is ok also     honey harbour,moon river or anywhere on georgian bay,or the kawarthas is easily within 3 from KW  I've never been out on LSC, I guess the big water kind of keeps me away as I could drive 3 hours and not be able to launch if the wind picks up.  I've heard about Mitchell's Bay for Bass and the south side for Musky.  I have to believe out from the mouth of the Thames has to be good for something as well.  What are considered the walleye hot spots?"
872403,KraTToR,2014-09-14 12:17:00,506,"Fished Restoule this week, wow that place is awesome. Which Lake? Commanda or Restoule?"
872408,leaf4,2014-09-14 12:26:00,2466,Saw a pic of you with a musky on the musky hunter page on fb nice fish!
872411,Musky or Specks,2014-09-14 12:49:00,2710,"Which Lake? Commanda or Restoule? No reason to fish Commanda no musky in there. Restoule,Stormy and Clear is plenty of ground to learn for a life time.Not to mention further down the system."
872413,bow slayer,2014-09-14 12:52:00,1074,"Restoule ,my favourite place in the world,just wish it was not 5 plus hours from me or I be there alot more than 3 weeks every summer.There are some big musky up there especially in stormy and clear lakes,restoule although it gets alot more pressure still has some beast also."
872414,bow slayer,2014-09-14 12:55:00,1074,"what I find weird is there are no musky in commanda and plenty in restoule,clear and stormy.....commanda has a good population of big crappy but I have not seen any in restoule or the others yet,has anybody else seen crappy in restoule ?"
872416,bow slayer,2014-09-14 12:56:00,1074,"No reason to fish Commanda no musky in there. Restoule,Stormy and Clear is plenty of ground to learn for a life time.Not to mention further down the system. Lennon Lake below the dam is good water"
872427,porkpie,2014-09-14 14:09:00,2521,"If your looking for big water, your going to drive.  I live north of you but there is a ton of fishing in the area, between reservoirs and rivers.  I find I'm never short of options.  It's also a pretty decent local to be a steelheader, I am right on the highway to Huron and GB.  Pick a map and throw a dart, any of the options you listed are good!  If your stuck on kawarthas, I agree that lowers buckhorn is an excellent destination!"
872462,PikeyArea,2014-09-14 17:13:00,19,The issue I have with places like Belwood and conestoga is the boat launching is all on GRCA land (Unless I'm mistaken please correct me) and they don't open until 8am. If I'm fishing I'm starting earlier than 8am...
872466,porkpie,2014-09-14 17:43:00,2521,"You can pay on your way out, no issues!"
872486,davey buoy,2014-09-14 19:34:00,5505,"Sturgeon point marina in Wasaga is the same way.When you come back in please pay.That works,as long as you know the rate."
