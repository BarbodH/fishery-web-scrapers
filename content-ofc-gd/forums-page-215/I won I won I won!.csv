872606,Ron,2014-09-15 14:20:00,1683,"I won the monthly 100.00 gift card from Gagnon Sports in Oshawa. I always thought these kinda sign ups were a bit of a gimmick but I am now a believer! I always thought if they were ligit, I would at least recognize the name of one of the monthly winners. I never expected it to be my name!  So to say ""THANKS"" to Gagnon's Sporting Goods in Oshawa, I want to give them a simple plug in hopes that more people register to see if they can win the 100.00 monthly gift certificate.  I simply registered my email address with them and get their monthly flyer. (It's the box under Restricted firearms in stock box).  http://www.gagnonsports.com/index.php  Now, what to buy with that 100 bucks.....  Cheers, Ron..."
