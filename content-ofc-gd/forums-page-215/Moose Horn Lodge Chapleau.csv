872281,lakerguy,2014-09-13 17:29:00,224,We were there in 09. Great accommodations. Fishing was pretty decent. If I recall the week we where there it was quite a mix bag of weather. Caught lots of walleye in one lake but can't seem to remember the lake name though (sample lake maybe) my son caught his pb walleye on the home lake that they are on. You can fish a diff lake each day almost. You do have to trailer your boat down logging rds. At the time we where there they seemed to be in pretty good shape. I would recommend a 4x4 truck as some of the launches where iffy or greasy if it had rained. And a saw if you don't want your truck scratched by trees grown in on some of the paths going into lakes. I definatly would go back
