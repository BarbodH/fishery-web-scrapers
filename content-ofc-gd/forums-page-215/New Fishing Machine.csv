871257,AdamS,2014-09-08 01:29:00,161,I almost forgot about this awesome van...this is what that guy looking for a truck should get.
871262,moxie,2014-09-08 01:42:00,1566,Very nice. Congratulations and enjoy.
871464,BillM,2014-09-09 01:06:00,17367,You need some sweet 70s fantasy graphics on the side of that thing
871468,kickingfrog,2014-09-09 01:11:00,8333,Like this? 
871489,BillM,2014-09-09 02:58:00,17367,"I was thinking less cartoon, more naked ladies!"
871495,solopaddler,2014-09-09 08:57:00,8605,"I was thinking less cartoon, more naked ladies!  How about this sweet ride?  "
871507,asdve23rveavwa,2014-09-09 11:39:00,2690,Great set-up Spiel!!!  Who needs a motel when you have that?!  Enjoy!!!
871514,BillM,2014-09-09 12:10:00,17367,"Mike nailed it, lol!"
871524,solopaddler,2014-09-09 13:12:00,8605,"Mike nailed it, lol!  How about the ultimate geekmobile? Darth Vaders Shaggin' Wagon.    (LOOK! It's a geek from another dimension!  )"
872519,Spiel,2014-09-14 21:37:00,9065, How about the ultimate geekmobile? Darth Vaders Shaggin' Wagon.    (LOOK! It's a geek from another dimension!  )  Where can I find one of those beauties?
872530,kickingfrog,2014-09-14 22:19:00,8333,The 1970's.
872531,Spiel,2014-09-14 22:23:00,9065,"The 1970's.   I know Rob. Truth is I had on back in the day. A short box Dodge with a slant six, three on the tree and some amazon women mural on the doors. Loved that van....."
872533,kickingfrog,2014-09-14 22:34:00,8333,I can see it now.... Spiel with long hair and bellbottoms.
872550,Regan Thompson,2014-09-15 00:22:00,80,"I wish I had that in my college days!  Nice ride, congrats."
860010,spinnerdoc,2014-06-24 01:50:00,556,Does that mean you'll be fishing more?  Congrats Chris..that is one sweet fishing machine...that has road trip written all over it
860011,BillM,2014-06-24 01:52:00,17367,I think it needs a set of BFG AT's as well  :)
860027,Ron,2014-06-24 03:16:00,1683,nice but I don't think it floats  Not a problem there Terry. Do you see the top with the canvas on it. It's actually a flat bottom boat disguised as a fiberglass top to the van.  
860036,limeyangler,2014-06-24 05:31:00,5204,"Awesome Chris, but cant shake this image from my mind.  "
860072,shane,2014-06-24 13:59:00,652,Reminds me of my VW Westphalia back in the 70's. Man I loved that van.
860073,BillM,2014-06-24 14:03:00,17367,Reminds me of my VW Westphalia back in the 70's. Man I loved that van.  You should see what those sell for now
860081,Terry,2014-06-24 15:27:00,14456,  Not a problem there Terry. Do you see the top with the canvas on it. It's actually a flat bottom boat disguised as a fiberglass top to the van.       I should have known  lol
860148,Fish Farmer,2014-06-24 19:55:00,2234,Thats perfect Chris.  Beer fridge and speakers.LOL   Nice ride. George Jones and the Stomp should sound good with a plate of fried Perch in one hand and a Brew in the other. Life don't get any better. 
860152,misfish,2014-06-24 20:00:00,29133,"George Jones and the Stomp should sound good with a plate of fried Perch in one hand and a Brew in the other. Life don't get any better.    Hey Dave,Just saying LOL  "
860183,dracokaos,2014-06-24 21:46:00,116,Does it float? lol  Sweet ride! Been trying to convince the wife we need RV of some kind. Gotta show her these pictures!  Cheers
861019,solopaddler,2014-06-30 23:16:00,8605,Sweet! I predict a couple of overnight steelheading trips will be happening this fall.
861032,Gerritt,2014-07-01 00:11:00,6129,"Ohhhh my, a modern shaggin' wagon... I gotta say that is one hell of an upgrade from your previous vans. This fall I expect to see it over here in quinte!  G"
861218,Spiel,2014-07-01 23:24:00,9065,"Thanks all. I just spent an extended weekend away in it, wow, roomy, comfy and with all the amenities for staying away for long periods of time. Happy, happy!"
861219,Roy,2014-07-01 23:27:00,13728,Great! Now you can sell your house.
861220,solopaddler,2014-07-01 23:49:00,8605,Great! Now you can sell your house.  This all makes sense now.     .
861626,msp,2014-07-04 19:19:00,1336,Awesome van ! Reminds me of my old VW 72 westfalia. Probably much faster on steep hills though
861628,dave524,2014-07-04 19:26:00,4508,"Sweet! I predict a couple of overnight steelheading trips will be happening this fall.  Had a 79 GMC done up, spent many nights in the 80's at Denny's Dam or Beautiful Joe Park. Great steelheading vehicle"

863047,kickingfrog,2014-07-14 20:08:00,8333,Rumor mill says 15 wimmins but only 2 men   Art And how many bears?
863138,Loonietoon,2014-07-15 00:42:00,1450,"Thanks all. I just spent an extended weekend away in it, wow, roomy, comfy and with all the amenities for staying away for long periods of time. Happy, happy! Congrats Chris you deserve it"

859890,Spiel,2014-06-23 14:02:00,9065,"Well after 22 months without wheels I finally pulled the trigger to get a new vehicle for pulling the boat. Doubles as a home away from home quite nicely, no tent required.                Cheers"
