260453,bushart,2008-10-21 21:40:00,2628,That picture looks like you could use your BBQ for a shooting rest overlooking that field.  Pull the hammer/gut/skin and badda boom/badda bing---tenderloin on the Que  Bushart
260454,misfish,2008-10-21 21:48:00,29133," I would ,but I do live with some tree huggers.LOL J/K"

260475,Leecher,2008-10-21 22:40:00,7832,"Cool..... love that stuf, certaintly makes for an easier tracking  Last year opening day, we woke up to a white scenery at hunting camp with 5"" of fresh snow ......9 days to go and counting Leechman"
260483,Rich,2008-10-21 22:49:00,3927,I find tracking bass is the same with or without the snow.
260503,tjsa,2008-10-21 23:51:00,1578,"  Well now, for once in recent memory, down south has had a snowfall before us  You can keep it for now Brian, at least another 2 weeks please!!!!!!  We do have the temps, -5C this morning, but scraping the windows of the truck beats removing the snow from it, shoveling the driveway, and the steps of the house, any day,"
