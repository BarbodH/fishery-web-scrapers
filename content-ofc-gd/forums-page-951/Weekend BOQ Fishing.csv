260160,young_one,2008-10-21 00:34:00,620,"I had the great opertunity to fish with Fishhunter(Lloyd) on Friday, Oct 18. Waking up abit late in Toronto, (4am) my family and I quickly took our boat and met up with Fishhunter and three fellow OFNers (Jose, Bill and Rob) My parents took the boat and fished on their own, while I tried to learn as much as possbile with Lloyd and company. A beautiful day it was, the morning air was clean, crisp and cold. I immediantly realize it's much more comfortable inside Lloyd's fully covered boat than the Tundra single concosle. The day started with Bill reeling in a nice eater walleye,    then follow by me with a soild fish. 4 Sheepheads were caught after and the grand slam 7lb walleye was caught by Rob. This happened while I was a sleep. (Yes, Lloyd's boat has a cozy bed space to sleep) When I woke up and heard  the news and saw the evidence, I felt missing out. So...for those of you who ever get a chance to fish with Lloyd, never fall for the nap temptation!    Lloyd is truly a great angler that has years of expereience with lure presentation and choice on the BOQ, we kept on switching lures and trying to figure out what they wanted. Although my goal for the trip was to learn as much as possible with fall Walleye fishing in a single day, I felt I could not match what Lloyd has to offer to those marble eyes. (hundreds of crankbaits, stickbaits and percise fishing equipment setups) We finish the day around 4 or 5 and took a few pictures to keep the good memory.   My parents soon followed to the harbor and picked me up with their boat. They didn't catch anything through out the day, so off I went, 2nd fishing trip within a day!   I tried to match what Lloyd used during the day, we trolled near the cement factory with in-line planner boards. To my greatest suprise, We hooked on TWO TROPHY FISH within 2hrs of fishing. First was a near 10lb Sheephead, then a 6.1/2lb Walleye!     Sunday was very slow with only a few Sheepheads and Silver Bass. I thought maybe the day was too clear?   This weekend was my best fall fishing on BOQ, thanks to Lloyd, Rob, Bill and Jose to make this happen. It was a great time with lots of laugh and fishing knowlege. (mcD, shootin ducks, Fred, sonar reading, line distance and etc)  Going back next weekend to try my luck again! You'll see me with the orange float suit and white Tracker! - Young One"
