I bought the bracket for the transducer and have it installed but I'm not quite certain how to run the cable to my unit. If someone has done this could they give me a few tips on running the cable?   Thanks in advance"
260443,Terry,2008-10-21 21:12:00,14456,"it's pretty hard to do on a PowerDrive shaft, the whole  length of the shaft  needs to be free to move up and down throught the motor drive  if your boat is fiberglass stick it on the hull"
260449,Muskieman,2008-10-21 21:25:00,2472,"I did the same thing to mine....here's what you do.... tie wrap the cable to the foot of your TM where the shaft meets the motor....do the same on the top ...go over the powerdrive I've had mine this way now for 4 yrs and have had no problems...leave slack in the cord so that you don't collide with the powerdrive....or you can do it the right way and take the TM apart and drill a few holes one at the top of the tube and one at the bottom of the tube and cut, run and splice the transducer cord through the tube...seal up the holes with silicone...make for a headache... we did this to my friends TM... works fine... the only this that is different is that it looks better.  hope this helps...  :Gonefishing:  RFS"

260492,Arnaldo de Sousa,2008-10-21 23:01:00,21,"Thanks for the help guys. . . . Randy great pic and I might tackle putting it through the shaft over the winter, but for now I'll let the cable hang loose over the front LOL - just hope I don't turn the motor to many rotations where it rips the wire out of the transducer     and hope it doesn't get tangled in the prop"
260501,Muskieman,2008-10-21 23:44:00,2472,Hasn't happened here in  4yrs...leave enough slack and you'll be fine.
260517,The Urban Fisherman,2008-10-22 00:27:00,2050,great thread guys!  I just baught a used PowerDrive motor tongiht and was wondering the same thing....I like the idea of running the wire through the shaft but if it leaked couldn't you destroy your motor?  thanks guys! UF
260524,Muskieman,2008-10-22 00:53:00,2472,On my buddy's boat It hasn't leaked a bit...we used a grommet set with silicone and ran the transducer wire through it and siliconing that hole as well...looks like a PRO job. Much like the livewell discharge on a boat.
260538,The Urban Fisherman,2008-10-22 01:48:00,2050,"cool Randy, I like the idea of having a clean look with no wires hanging around, but like arnaldo said it might be a winter project....I have to get a second graph anyways! lol  I think I'm just going to get a second base/power/transducer/GPS receiver and bring my current graph/GPS combo back and forth....  cheers, UF"
260557,workwear,2008-10-22 02:36:00,592,ive installed my tranducer like randy has.....and have yet to have a problem.......just make sure you install the transducer to the bottom of the trolling motor......  some have mention plscing it at the bottom of the hull...i dont think it would work well on choppy days.....   good luck
