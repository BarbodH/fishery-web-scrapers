260061,Nebby,2008-10-20 19:26:00,6,About twenty years ago we used to get them at the last culvert before the old MNR camp on Peshu Lake.  I think this is where Peshu runs into Aubrey.  Water levels change but we used chest waders and regular landing nets.  I can't remember the exact time of year but it was cold and late at night.  They also use to get them out of boats along the shore lines.
260076,anders,2008-10-20 20:25:00,1168,"smelt net is the best...its light and small holes.  Go after dark with a large spotlight.  Early November is the best, when its cold, a bit of ice around and when you pull your net up,it freezes.  Thats the best time.  Dont forget to get your permit from the mnr first.  Its free."
260111,cram,2008-10-20 22:05:00,1733,You can net them?  I assume they come up to spawn in the rivers?  How many are you allowed to net?  What do they taste like?
260123,outdoorguy61,2008-10-20 22:47:00,220,"I am not familiar with any netting access in Ontario, other than commercial operations. Could this simply be a troll?  I did experience netting whitefish in Alberta, with a $5 permit that allowed a person to net fish in prairie drainage canals (I went by McGregor Reservoir). This was neat to do, and semi made sence given that any fish left in the fall would die with the dropping canal waters. We used a large landing net, but the local farmers used some larger nets, sometimes apparently running afoul with the authorities.  I did not enjoy the way they tasted, but some do like them smoked.  outdoorguy61"
260261,anders,2008-10-21 12:50:00,1168,"some like them but they are the best smoked.  Most places the limit is 25, but really who in there right mind you keep 25 fair sized fish to eat.  5 is plenty for me, its just really fun to do."
