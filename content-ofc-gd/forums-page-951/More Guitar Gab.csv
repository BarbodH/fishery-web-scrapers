259293,JohnF,2008-10-17 14:23:00,3494," Little bro would freak at the thought of posting pics of his gear on the net. He had one home studio in London cleaned out by thieves years ago and is now very cautious. He said it wasn't so bad replacing most of the gear but a couple of special guitars and some original recordings he had stored were taken, including everything recorded by his first road band and all the personal stuff he'd recorded throughout his career. You musicians will sympathize. He started with audio tape when he was just a young teenager in the 60's and lost it all. Now he has everything digitized and backed up.  Be careful out there.  JF"

In university I found it in someone else's room filled with beer....LOL."
259303,jwl,2008-10-17 14:43:00,1056,"   that's funny you say your ""camping"" Yamaha acoustic..and ""I don't care what happens to it guitar""  I got the same thing...had it for like 12 years now..story behind it is, I was up North camping fishin on St. Joe's Island, wanted a guitar for sitting around the camp fire so I thought I would go into town and try and find a used music shop on a whim..I lucked out....right first when I went in the door, was a guitar hanging on the wall with a little sign attached to it saying ""looking for a good camp fire""..I thought it was funny because that's exactly what I was looking for it for..so for $85 bucks for the guitar and another $25 for a case..I was out the door for $110 with a decent guitar.    It's was scratched to crap in the back....but great action,great sound and I been using it ever since as my ""camping"" guitar.  This pic is from the weekend up at my camp..I keep it there in the summer, brought it back home after winterizing..had to end the season with a couple tunes by the fire.."

I don't have to tell you how much that sweetie is worth today... but I wouldn't be surprised if it is equal to a pretty nice new car!!!

260283,danbo,2008-10-21 14:33:00,2646,"* A man gives his son an electric bass for his 15th birthday, along with a coupon for four bass lessons. When the son returns from his first lesson, the father asks, ""So, what did you learn?""  ""Well, I learned the first five notes on the E string."" Next week, after the second lesson, the father again asks about the progress, and the son replies, ""This time I learned the first five notes on the A string."" One week later, the son comes home far later than expected, smelling of cigarettes and beer. So the father asks: ""Hey, what happened in today's lesson?"" ""Dad, I'm sorry I couldn't make it to my lesson; I had a gig!""  Paaarump,pump, pump!"
260286,JohnF,2008-10-21 14:49:00,3494,Wish I could show y'all pics of my guitars but they've all been stolen by my son and now live at his house. All I have left is the old long neck banjo which I can't play worth a sore patoot.  Some of you Gretsch fans from the London area may remember a feller by the name of Rick R. who had a pretty nice collection of Gretsch units. He was co-owner of Music Mart back in the day. My little bro worked there for years selling stuff. Skinny redhead who could play pretty well. His name is Rick too.  JF
260309,douG,2008-10-21 15:31:00,2693,"Danbo, I'm liking your PRS Custom.  Does Carlos Santana still play PRS?"
259031,Billy - Curtiss,2008-10-16 18:46:00,241," You can technically run any electric instrument through one of those units even if they are made specifically for guitar. For acoustic instruments, just play into a microphone and then run that signal through the processor. A good friend of mine is always messing around like that with his fiddle! I don't see why a squeeze box wouldn't be just lovely as well!"
259035,misfish,2008-10-16 19:05:00,29133," Now you got me thinking. A fiddle and a sqeezer. Just need a banjo, and we got some good ol play,n happen,n. Thanks Billy."
259112,JohnF,2008-10-16 23:02:00,3494," I've sent this to my bro. He's got a basement full of the latest stuff for digitizing, recording, and mixing. He had (perhaps) the first Roland guitar synth in Canada. I forget the model name but it was the greatest thing since sliced bread when it came out years ago. Even my son the bass player is impressed with the thing.... today. Little bro could make his Strat sound like Jimi Hendrix's Firebird, even changing individual strings for new effects. Or make the same Strat sound like a Martin acoustic, or his old black round bodied Ovation which he still says was the prettiest sounding 12 string ever. It was pretty damned cool, even to a tin ear like mine.  He's always replacing stuff in his studio and then selling off the old bits. If Matt (my son) hasn't already grabbed the thingy you want, there's every possibility Litlle Bro has one laying around.  JF"
259122,jwl,2008-10-16 23:52:00,1056,"nice toys there, I haven't tried out those models, but have tried other simular models out that friends have had over the years for some fun..you can get some wicked effects for sure...you have to really goof around with them and get the sound you like..then you have to remember all the settings  Myself, I also like to keep my gear pretty simple...I pretty much keep my effects down to a minimum..heck my amp doesn't even have a dirty channel..it's a 1976 Sunn Stagemaster- 400 watts of @$$ kicking clean..the perfect amp for a solid classic hard rock backbone..even with just my BOSS Turbo Overdrive pedal it sounds awesome..the amp itself has a great EQ system..primitive with lots of knobs to toy with but crisp as anything...my general set-up for jamming is pretty much just the overdrive,a chorus, and a wah.   Have fun figuring out the new toy there Blaque, it will take you a long time to figure some stuff out, and a bonus surprize when you areplaying and stumble upon a whole new cool sound..just remember if you are customizing your own sounds, and come up with somehting really cool.....write the numbers down man..lol"
259153,danbo,2008-10-17 01:39:00,2646,Here's another pedal I have..  http://www.zoom.co.jp/english/products/g21u/  Digitech Metal Master is fun too.
259157,ccmtcanada,2008-10-17 01:47:00,7971,"For years I had just one pedal...the Boss Turbo Overdrive pedal...and it still works today.  I bought that one back in 1984.  A few years ago, when my old high school band got back together again, I needed more effects.  The other guitarist in my band has the Pod effects board, but I couldn't afford that...LOL.  For about half the price, I picked up this Korg board...has served me well....just program what sound you like, name it and save it in one of dozens of banks.   Thought I'd also show a few pics of my current setup in the basement...for digital recording.  I use an 800 watt, 8 channel mixer to pre-process vocals and guitars and record straight into the PC.  I also have condenser microphones...that use power from the amp.  They are much more sensitive and picks up highs and lows better than standard microphones.  You'll see a cheap bass guitar I use to lay down bed tracks as well as my Fender semi acoustic.  All of my band's music is recorded using this setup.    "
