I go there because a friend lives there and we meet up at the pier to fish; it's easy to fish from and easy to release fish.  The thing is that St. Catharines is kind of far.  I've heard Bronte mentioned a few times which I think is in either Oakville or Mississauga.  I don't know the specifics of exactly where to go.  Could someone point me in the right direction for some spots closer to North York?   Bronte or otherwise?   I don't have waders, but I'd be willing to get some if that's what I need.  Thanks in advance."

Grab yourself a map and a copy of the regs for finding areas with extended seasons. Pretty much any trib from Niagara Falls to Port Hope and beyond has fishable #'s of trout and salmon running them."
