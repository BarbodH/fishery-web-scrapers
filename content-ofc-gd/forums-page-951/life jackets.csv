259993,gdelongchamp,2008-10-20 15:00:00,199,Does anyone wear self inflating life jackets that self inflate as soon as you hit water? No strings to pull etc. I am wondering if they are made and where I may get one. At this time of year I would be more comfortable fishing if I could get one.  Any help would  be appreciated.

260085,carp-starter,2008-10-20 21:02:00,253,"Percher is right – get a floater suit first especially if you fish alone. Then for next summer get the vests.  Also make sure you have a GPS, VHF and a cell phone. Make sure you TAKE and have warm batteries considering that there are many fishers who for their camera - I forgot them, I dropped them in the water, my sister took the batteries, the batteries went dead.  And make sure you have flares – more than what the law says you must have. Another thing to have are two (2) cans of gas to make the gas operated horn work. There should be a WHISTLE attached to every life vest.  In cold water temperatures, DO NOT TAKE ANY CHANCES and TAKE ALL THE PRECAUTIONS YOU CAN.  A good company like Mustang makes both the vest and the floater suits – but pricey.  The life vests can be bought at Le Baron has both BPS (probably) West Marine – there are stores in the GTA Genco Marine – I bought mine at Genco The Store Masons - Mississauga Other larger marine stores will also have the life vest and floater suits  carp-starter"
