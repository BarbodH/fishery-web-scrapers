I have only used them a few times this past summer and have not even caught any fish on them! There seem's to be a tarnish or something on the blades. Can I scrub this off or do i now need to replace them. I thought these were ""good"" brands...this is only going on with my Strike King and my Booyah spinnerbaits. Here is a pic of what im seeing.      Thanks for any help."
259537,wuchikubo,2008-10-18 17:25:00,1114,"Sure looks like oxidation and corrosion to me. Try using some baking soda and a moist scrub pad/sponge to remove it. The blades will still work and you may want to see if there is too much moisture and or salted plastics in close vicinity of where you store those lures.  If the baking soda doesn't work you can try a short soaking in vinegar with salt to see if the tarnish will come out better. Just remember not to let it soak too long or else it will start to corrode even more. Once done, rinse with water, dry and rub on a tiny bit of WD40."
259538,misfish,2008-10-18 17:36:00,29133,"How are you storing them?  If you DO NOT keep them in an air tight locker,this will happen. Make sure thier dry when you put them away."
259539,steverowbotham,2008-10-18 17:42:00,1800,dry them before you store them ... any moisture and this will happen.  I actuslly have spinnerbait blades that I purposely do this to.  The gold/green tarnish makes a very nice perch imitation.
259544,MCTFisher9120,2008-10-18 18:45:00,3761," Hey it worked perfectly, I soaked the blades in vinegar with salt for a few minutes rinsed with water and gave each blade a good wipe. The tarnish was bugging me for awhile so im glad I asked how to take care of it. Here is the finished product:   Thank's a lot!"
259550,Fishn Technishn,2008-10-18 19:15:00,198,Good advice re: allowing to dry before storing! I also spray mine with (don't tell my wife!!  ) HAIRSPRAY. It is a water soluble laquer that will keep them very shiny after you polish them up. You CAN use a permanent clear coat but it is a real pain if you need to touch them up.  FT
259555,Rich,2008-10-18 19:43:00,3927,"At least your blades aren't falling off! It seems my Boo-Yahs are all losing their blades for no reason on casts or on fish strikes. And yesterday, everytime one of my BPS Lazer Eyes got smacked by a smallie they lost the colorado blade. Cheap crap, I tells ya!"
259567,bassjnkie,2008-10-18 20:24:00,1101,"When I buy the bass pro lazer eyes, I change the clevis and rings. I had blades fly off while casting. I had problems with corrosion, as mentioned salt and vinegar works the best.  Mike like others have said, make sure to dry them out before storing.  Daniel"
259570,Jigger,2008-10-18 20:40:00,1237,"Blades flying off during a cast might be happening if the wire shaft isn't bent closed around the split ring. Smallies attacking the blades happens quite frequently and often the bait is hit so violently that the blade will be ""smacked"" off. Has nothing to do with how expensive or cheap the spinnerbait is, just have to check them regularily to make sure they're in good working order."
259572,Rich,2008-10-18 20:49:00,3927,"Actually, the BPS ones the smaller blade is held on with a bent wire, rather than a proper metal clevis with pinholes drilled in it. As a result, the wire easily bends open and the blades fly off.  I've spinnerbaited smallies for 15 years of my life and these are the only spinnerbaits it has happened to.  Cheap crap."
259574,Jigger,2008-10-18 20:54:00,1237,"Huh, sounds like you need to buy better spinnerbaits Iguess..."
259629,mikeh,2008-10-19 00:24:00,824,"I know this is off topic but I just bought some of these. Hopefully after a pike bites it the weld doesn't break , also has wire holding the skirt on .  team daiwa spinnerbaits"
259631,misfish,2008-10-19 00:29:00,29133,Stanley spinner baits.  Named after my pop.LOL
259635,Wild,2008-10-19 00:39:00,704,Hey he makes great hammers too!
259665,steverowbotham,2008-10-19 03:32:00,1800,"I love Stanley spinnerbaits as well.  They bend very easily, but are easily bent back into shape, and they catch a lot of fish"
259676,outllaw,2008-10-19 10:53:00,1232,lots of chinese crap being imported. there processes are to save money. not create quality by any means.
259871,MCTFisher9120,2008-10-20 00:48:00,3761, Where could i get some of those?
