259858,MJL,2008-10-20 00:15:00,2427,Big Congrats Jerry!  I've seen people hook into them while salmon fishing the Niagara and saw some small ones landed in the rivers near Quinte. I think next year I might buy a new musky outfit and try my hand at catching one.  WTG
259866,ctdd2006,2008-10-20 00:25:00,531,Awesome stuff!
259876,tbayboy,2008-10-20 00:52:00,1497,"That's a nice fish from a boat never mind from shore.  Congrats, it's all downhill from here"
259913,sharper,2008-10-20 03:04:00,279,"Thanks for tuning the pic GCD, my only regret was not having my camera with me. No pike for me yet Victor but I'll settle for the musky   . Kemper you got a PM and we still need to hookup for steelhead. Jedi that was a great guess he was 38"" and put up a hell of a fight."
259673,sharper,2008-10-19 05:00:00,279,Caught my first musky yesterday and from shore as well. I was using my jointed perch pattern rapala and 8lb test braid. It hit in the evening and I didn't have my camera with me so picture was taken with a cellphone hence the bad quality. It was my first musky so I wanted to share.  
259674,snag,2008-10-19 05:25:00,1932,Congrats!!!!  Looks impressive.  
259678,lew,2008-10-19 11:27:00,12767,"A nice chunky fish,  congratulations on your 1st ever musky."

259711,Wild,2008-10-19 14:18:00,704,A great catch Sharper but where did you catch it?
259751,Victor,2008-10-19 16:46:00,1609,Congrats Jerry! That's a nice sized one too eh! AND from shore!  so... u've caught a muskie this season... but... no pike yet lol?
259754,kemper,2008-10-19 17:07:00,2232,Sharper Nice fish man!  I think I recognize where you are...and if Im right...there is muskies there!?  Can you PM me to let me know?
259760,mepps,2008-10-19 17:30:00,1301,"That probably the biggest shore caught musky I've ever seen, nice! My biggest was 36 inches."
259762,b2kptbo,2008-10-19 17:45:00,1505,"A good one 4 sure, congrats..."
259763,lew,2008-10-19 17:46:00,12767,"Just an FYI guys, but catching muskies in tight to shore is certainly not unusual, infact it's extremely common. We regularily get them from a boat casting very tight towards the shore, infact many of our fish come from within 2' of shore in only a couple feet of water. I once got a 50""er in 1' of water and he was almost touching the shore.  Not much difference really from casting in tight to shore from a boat, or standing on shore and casting out and then retrieving back to shore.  The 1st musky my wife ever got was a 43""er from the dock on only the 2nd cast of the morning, infact anyone who has ever met my wife has heard the story many many times  When we fish on Lake St. Clair in the fall we see shore bound fishermen bringing in BIG muskies on a regular basis.  I'm not trying to diminsh the accomplishment of Sharper, infact it's an extremely nice fish he got, I'm just letting you know that if you don't have a boat and are looking for muskies you have a very good chance of getting one using that method."
259769,salmon,2008-10-19 18:28:00,334, Great info Lew I still have a chance to catch one..
259771,jediangler,2008-10-19 18:56:00,1923,"Congrats sharper, that is a nice one. Did you get a measurement on it? Looks to be 37-39"". How close is my guess?"
259772,Leecher,2008-10-19 18:56:00,7832,Great report and pic sharper  Thanks for sharing your catch with us..... a real beauty Good job and congratulation on your first Leechman
