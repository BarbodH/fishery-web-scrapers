259447,solopaddler,2008-10-17 23:22:00,8605,"I've done a bunch of extended solo canoe trips, longest one was almost 4 months. On that trip I went 7 weeks without seeing another human being.  So yeah, depending on my mood I love to fish alone."
259466,bigugli,2008-10-18 01:35:00,6138,Somedays you just need that quiet of being by yourself to collect your thoughts and consider the important things in your life.
259469,mikeh,2008-10-18 02:03:00,824,When I fish alone I will not take the pfd off . Going fishing solo tomorrow on Georgian Bay and will probably wear a floater suit and will not lean over too far to land and release that big musky.
259499,Dabluz,2008-10-18 05:28:00,701,"I go out fishing alone most of the time.  However, my hired body guards are not far from me in another boat and my private helicopter is within a few minutes just in case."
259558,Rich,2008-10-18 20:03:00,3927,"I don't often fish alone in the boat because well, it pretty much takes two to launch mine. I also get bored fishing alone. I'm good for a couple hours then usually go in.  As for safety, never worried much. I keep a cell phone in a Ziploc bag to prevent it from getting waterlogged and not working, and if the water's looking treacherous I'll gladly put on the PFD."
259582,Fisherman,2008-10-18 21:44:00,7201,"Something a lot may not be aware of, all the extra clothes you wear along with boots, etc, act like an anchor once they get wet and trying to swim or get back to the surface is almost impossible.  I fell into about 4' of water once with fleece pants boots and a heavy sweater, it was a real effort just to get up on shore.  Wear the damm PFD."
259586,JerseyDog,2008-10-18 22:06:00,190," While I agree that the 401 can be a pretty hairy run, especially through TO, fishing is a dangerous sport in terms of drowning with 39% of people who drowned in Canada between 1991-2000 being engaged in fishing and another 6% in hunting make 45% of drowning victims some kind of sportsman (total 606 people). And while the study does not break out for solo trips, I can only imagine that substantially increases the risk.  That being said, I fish alone probably 85% of the time. What a great way to get away from it all."
259948,tinbanger,2008-10-20 11:57:00,1028,"Thanks for the replies and some great ( luckily!) stories.  Follow some basic safe boating practices , be prepared and where a pfd and there will be lots of great stories to come.  TB"
259963,holdfast,2008-10-20 12:52:00,1813,"My Worries are rogue bears, humans, and my vehical getting stuck.  Finally got CAA, Cell Phone with a charger, tool Kit, Flare gun, First Aid Kit, Life Jacket is on in a canoe, and a couple of shots of Southern Comfort only once Im ashore to put me to sleep.  And I take my chances carefully most times."
259974,limeyangler,2008-10-20 13:35:00,5204,"I'm not retired or anything, but i just fish so often a lot of my buddies cant keep up....lol...so i also fish alone a lot too. I dont think you can have enough safety gear...as anyone who has seen my recent posts would have to see where i'm coming from. I am definitely going to get one of those GPS spo signal things, not only for my own safety...but my wife's piece of mind, cell phone a no go up here...can hardly get signals even in town!!!! Lots of folks thought i was weird last winter here....i was wearing my boat pFD jacket under my winter jacket when icefishing.....made me feel safer...specially around first ice, even when the ice was 4 feet thick by February i always carried my ice spikes. Happy hunting/fishing...keep safe all."
259980,mistyriver1,2008-10-20 13:43:00,600,"Great thread.  I'm fortunate that I have two fishing partners under the same roof so I usually have someone with me.  However, when we go for our family fishing vacations, I usually like to go out in the early morning myself for a couple of hours.  I just make sure all of my items are accessable, (ie cell phone, two way radio, etc..) and have my net, pliers, bolt cutters within a quick grab.  When I am alone, I always wear my PFD.  It just gives me a sense of extra comfort.  I also tell my wife when to expect me in."
260014,daking_eh2007,2008-10-20 16:34:00,31,"Make sure that ""Kill Switch"" is attached to you all the time, I know it is very inconvenient but is can be the difference berween life and death!"
260089,misfish,2008-10-20 21:11:00,29133," Great advice. Back when I had my mishap, I did not have that feature,but the tiller throttle would cut down to nil. When I had the bass boat, I always made sure it was attached to my PFD and HOOKED UP TO THE KILL SWITCH. Big dif between 23 mph and 58 MPH ,when you go FLYING out of a boat.  Thanks again for a great thread."
260103,Carp,2008-10-20 21:49:00,1488,  60 F ??? That's bathwater for us canucks Glen. Might be a tad chilly for a guy who goes shirtless most of the year though.
259408,Jigger,2008-10-17 21:00:00,1237,"I fish alone 99% of the time. I don't wear a pfd 90% of the time unless its really rough out or getting near freeze up. Like Lew said, stand on the lower part of the boat and you automatically find yourself more at ease. If you feel sketched out by something, you probably should find a safer way to do it. Accidents are more often than not a result of bad planning, un-organized boat with lures and rods everywhere, etc... I try and make sure, especially with the temps dropping that theres nothing to trip on when fishing standing up."
259409,tinbanger,2008-10-17 21:05:00,1028,Can't deer hunt on my own ...colour blind ...blood looks brown on the leaves.  And keep quiet about the cell phone ..also keeps my better half happy  TB
259418,Sinker,2008-10-17 21:27:00,8692,"I fish and hunt alone all the time. I don't mind it one bit. I just make sure I'm extra careful, and keep things under control. I think I know where to draw the line when it comes to solo adventures. I figure if I'm gonna go, I would rather be fishing or hunting, but I'm extra careful when I""m solo...  Sinker"
259430,Squid,2008-10-17 22:06:00,1656,"Very good topic. Now that the cold weather is upon us, we have to ensure that we are safe out there. I wear my floater suit during this time of year. When fishing the Niagara, I will wear the lifejacket when I am moving at speed."
259431,Muskieman,2008-10-17 22:08:00,2472,I'm usually a solitary fisherman...I'll go out with the kids but most times I'm alone in the boat.  BUt two weekends ago I was alone IN the creek..  I went out for Specs.   I tried to leap over a narrow spot in the creek to get to a pool I've never fished....The creek was wider than I thought...I ended up on my   in the creek with water over my head and legs stuck in the mud....I managed to grab onto some CATTAILS..and little branches on shore and pulled my head out of the water for a breather.... after about a minute {felt like a lifetime}..of doing this I started to move my legs around.. I felt a rock or a log under my left heel and gave it all I had ..... I MADE IT OUT!  I went back the next day with my wife and kids to get my fishing rod from the bottom of             'Ol Smokey Creek ...I used a stick.  I fell In last fall 54% degree water ...I tripped over my net and in I went off the bow...I was wearing my Ski-Doo suit boots and all... the current brought me right by the transom where I grabbed on and pulled my frozen self into the boat.  NO PFD  Needless to say I always wear a PFD now when I'm with my kids or alone.  As for fishing creeks with a PFD  forget it....I'll take my chances...again.  RFS
259435,DRIFTER_016,2008-10-17 22:22:00,10439,"There are a lot more dangerous things than fishing alone. Just driving the 401 you are risking your life every time you are out!!!!!! I do most of my fishing and hunting alone. I camp alone in Grizzly country and the waters I fish will cause hypothermia in a heartbeat. If you use common sense and are prepared you get to live. In the winter I will take my snowmobile 100 miles from civilization to hit some Laker hotspots, if you are prepared for any problem that might come up it is not nearly as risky as it may sound. When I'm just out for the day I make sure I have everything I need to survive if something should happen"
259437,misfish,2008-10-17 22:27:00,29133," You just take me along ,I can follow the trail and even clean yer kill,,,,just so you dont cut yerself.LOL  Tell ya the story about the year after.The Mrs,s knew about my friend the year before and when I called and told her I had a deer down the first hour of the hunt and was getting ready to gut and drag it out (I was alone).I could hear in in her voice she was concerned. I myself did the drag nice and easy thinking about him all the time. Once I had the deer in the back of the truck ,I called her and well,she was happy to hear. This year Im looking forward to dragging as I am in much better shape and look forward to the workout.  Now if there was a deer that would help me out with this   Oh there is another story,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, Some here remember my outing on Little lake here in Barrie. I did not have the tiller snugged right and was not wearing my PFD.When I reached for my pack of smokes,the motor went left,I went right and in I went at full throttle. Thank GOD,he was watching over me. The boat came right back to me,full circle.Oh ,that was in the fridged waters at the beginning of may that season."
