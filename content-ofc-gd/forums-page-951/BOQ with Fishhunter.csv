It was a bit chilly but Lloyd's boat with the cover over helm and seating area made a nice warm ride to the first spot.  Our ride for the day   Not long after rigging the planner board (with in the first hour) I was first up with a fair sized pickeral, don't have any pic's of my fish on my camera so one of the others can post them. Pic's of the catching rotation.  Will with a good pickeral.   Jose with a Sheephead.   Rob ---- Sheephead.   My next was a ------------ Sheephead.  Will ---- Sheephead.   Jose ---- Sheephead.   And Rob with this brute.   Lloyd's boat is well equipped and A1 rods and reels, all our fish came off the boards but Lloyd did try the down riggers a coule different times and was on top of the lure change ups. With what I heard over his radio from the over boats and how they where doing he kept us on the fish.    Catchin some fish, good company, a few laughs, nice comfortable boat, for me it was a good day.  Nice fishing with you guys, Lloyd I had a Blast.  Bill..."
