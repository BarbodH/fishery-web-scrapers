259596,JerseyDog,2008-10-18 22:29:00,190,"I got my latest pair at LL Bean. They guarantee everything they sell for life.  I got their cheap house brand breathable which were ok, but they had a lot of other more expensive brands (and great prices)."
259663,Dabluz,2008-10-19 03:15:00,701,"I've also got some cheap Canadian Tire neoprene chest waders.  They were on special for about 80 dollars.  I've been using them for about 5 or 6 years now and I even lend them out.  Ok, the solid rubber foot is something you won't write home about but they do give a solid footing when walking along the shoreline.  I don't wear wading boots very often so I didn't mind buying something cheaper.  The water up here in the Saguenay region of Quebec stays cold all summer so neoprene is the way to go.  I wear a thin pair of long underwear underneath the waders.  So far, no leaks and no humidity problems either.  Now, I'm trying to find something to keep my elbows dry when I go into water deeper than my waist."
260102,jrego7,2008-10-20 21:48:00,37,Hmm. So far the simm's have caught my attention. Does it matter how you store them? Can I fold them up and put them away in a tote?
260105,danbo,2008-10-20 21:50:00,2646,Hang 'em up to air-dry for a day or so..then put 'em away. Get them a bit big so you have room for layers & extra sox for winter steelys!
260110,jrego7,2008-10-20 21:58:00,37, Thanks for the info now it's a matter of going out and buying them  Where is wilson's exactly? I know where bps is.  Edit: Do they have a site?
260112,solopaddler,2008-10-20 22:08:00,8605," I always hang mine for storage, never fold. If you want them to last longer (and breath) keep them clean by washing with mild soap."
260163,BillM,2008-10-21 00:36:00,17367,"Guys, is there any other place around the GTA or a bit further that I can pick up some decent waders other then BPS?"
260165,danbo,2008-10-21 00:40:00,2646,
260170,BillM,2008-10-21 00:47:00,17367,Thanks Dan!
260172,danbo,2008-10-21 00:49:00,2646,
260190,BillM,2008-10-21 01:33:00,17367,So.....many.....choices.. lol
260281,jrego7,2008-10-21 14:29:00,37,Ummm. Some say you shouldn't fold them. Does it really matter? If you let them dry would it be ok to store them in a tote from canadian tire? Replies are contradicting. I've been thinking about upping my budget and getting the G4's.
260284,danbo,2008-10-21 14:38:00,2646,"I'd just go shopping, myself.."
260307,solopaddler,2008-10-21 15:30:00,8605, As mentioned don't store them folded. For the definitive answer Simms recommends either hanging them up (my choice) or laying them flat under your bed.  http://www.simmsfishing.com/site/about_repairs.html
260350,MARK69,2008-10-21 16:45:00,24,"Personally I was a huge Simms fan until I tried a pair of Wardell's....Try them all on, pick the best fit and I guarantee you, you will pick these.  Freek"
260440,JohnF,2008-10-21 21:09:00,3494," I second that, big time. I have examples of neoprene that proves it (several wetsuits) and my Bare drysuit (more like heavy weight breathable wader material) is showing signs of stress at the folds from being stored in the tote bag that came with it.  Hang 'em up by the heels or on a hook through a fastener attached to the material. Don't hang them for very long with the weight on the suspenders. They tend to stretch and lose their elasticity.  JF"
258506,jrego7,2008-10-15 03:37:00,37,I want to invest some money into some waders. I am willing to spend $500 or even a bit more. Any links or advice from experience would be appreciated. Thanks
258511,silvio,2008-10-15 04:07:00,433,Simms g3 or g4 are nice.
258514,danbo,2008-10-15 04:24:00,2646,Breathable Hipwaders are fine for most of our creeks. Neoprene Chest Waders for Winter Steel.  http://www.basspro.com/webapp/wcs/stores/s...000_400019000_1
258527,cplummer,2008-10-15 06:20:00,165,I use BARE  breathables  and they are a great wader and they come in many thicknesses to fit your needs I have a summer and a winter pair and they are under 300 bucks at Peters in st kitts... Well worth a look...  simms are also a great wader but alot more dollar... Cliff...
258533,solopaddler,2008-10-15 09:01:00,8605,"If your budget is that high then Simms no question. I like the new G3 guide waders. Simms warranty and customer service is second to none in my experience as well. Last year I sent them back a pair of guide boots that had been through the wringer. The soles were falling off and they were coming apart at the seams. I expected nothing as they weren't defective, just over used. Still, Simms mailed me back a brand new pair of their latest boots free of charge. That speaks volumes."
258564,Sebastian,2008-10-15 13:26:00,208,"I have G3's and they are absolute crap. All the seams leak just a little bit. No tears, punctures and not much use. Over priced crap to target a market that makes you look good. They are the most comfortable waders and best looking ones but whats the point when they're useless for wading. I have another friend who had the same thing with waders and the crappy wading g3 jacket. Breathable waders are the perfect idea but if you plan on doing serious fishing of walking through bushes and lots of hiking then get some neoprenes. BAREs should do the trick.  And yes i know this will cause trouble with all the G3 lovers out there..."
258568,BillM,2008-10-15 13:57:00,17367,Are the BARE's in a similar price range of the Simms?
258572,KelfuN,2008-10-15 14:05:00,246,"im using the Bare 3.5mm neoprene and it was only like $140 check out lebaron, they carry quite a few bare waders"
258579,Carlitoboy,2008-10-15 14:46:00,5,"That's a big budget for waders.  Maybe you can buy two pair, and I'll jump in one of them?"
258586,solopaddler,2008-10-15 15:14:00,8605,"  Really? Because I've used a bunch (Orvis, Bare, Cabelas, Hodgman, LL Bean, Cloudveil) and the Simms are the only ones that havn't leaked in the first seasons use. The Bare and Cabelas waders leaked the first time I used them. That's my experience, and I fish hard, put a lot of miles on my waders. Personally I wouldn't even consider buying anything else at this point."
258667,JohnF,2008-10-15 20:02:00,3494," I don't get in the water anywhere near as often as you, but I use mine hard when I do get out once a week or so. One of my fave spots requires sliding on my butt down a steep wall for about 10' because of the slippery felt soles on my boots and I usually end up climbing up on my knees to get out. So far the worst the waders have suffered is grass stains.  The waders are Hodgman breathables with felt soled Hodgman boots that I picked up on sale at Dick's in the States for well under $100. Kinda baggy but very comfortable and durable.  So far so good.  JF"
258668,JohnF,2008-10-15 20:03:00,3494, We've all had good luck with Bare dive wear but when there is a warranty issue it's not always so easy to get service. Perhaps the fishwear dept is better.  JF
258670,super dave,2008-10-15 20:37:00,323,"I have had numerous problems with Bare breathable waders.  The only good side was that their customer service was fantastic.  Every leak, I received a brand new pair of waders.  But after the 6th pair I decided it was time to try something new. I currently own two pairs of breathables and I love both of them and no leak issues so far.  I have simms G3.  They fit me great, soft supple feel to them and no leak issues.  I can't comment on the customer service yet and hopefully will not for a long time. Second pair are LL Bean's wicked tough gortex waders.  A little stiffer than the G3s but absolutely no leak issues with these as well.  I have talked to people who also own these waders and they said they are bomb proof.  The best part is LL bean will take them back no questions ask with any problem you have with them.   They will even ship you a pair in advance of you sending back the old pair.   My only complaint about them is the cuff is little tight and hard to pull over your wading boots.  The simms use neoprene which is stretchy. I don't think you can go wrong with either.  The LL beans retail for $299 and the simms I believe are about the same price.  If you go for the simms, buy them at wilson's on queen.  they will beat BPS's price by a couple of bucks. I don't think you can go wrong with either."
258716,forrest,2008-10-15 22:13:00,1032,I have read that LL Bean has lifetime warranties on some waders.
258719,BillM,2008-10-15 22:17:00,17367,My oldman has a pair of Simms and loves them to death.  There is a pair at BPS for $199 that are XXL's that I am looking at.
258732,highdrifter,2008-10-15 22:44:00,2534, Seams should carry a lifetime guarantee..  Send them in!!
258734,highdrifter,2008-10-15 22:51:00,2534," I conquer duuude.  Sent in a pair of guide model gortex 2 years back.  I purchased them back in 1999, when they first came out.  They were $600+ back then, but they were worth every penny.  Anywho, sent them in for repair and was sent a brand new pair!!  Apparently, the inner gortex layer had seperated from the outter shell, and there was a lifetime guarantee on them!  I think they're around $300 now..  Customer service, guality, looks(i look soo phrunky in them).  There's no question.  It's simms for my buck.  aayyoooooo HD"
258737,irishfield,2008-10-15 22:57:00,26272,Well don't go cheap and buy Redheads ! Leah bought me a set of hip waders a couple years ago.. stored properly and everything and they still cracked. I'm still using them.. but have learned to take my socks off to do so !  
258738,BillM,2008-10-15 22:59:00,17367,"Wayne, those are identical to the ones I've been using.  I end up with a boot full of burrs/leaves and sweat everytime I use them, lol"
258765,Sebastian,2008-10-16 00:46:00,208,Maybe i should send in my Simms. Maybe they can change my mind on their product.
258842,danbo,2008-10-16 03:03:00,2646,Those Canadian Tire waders last & last. Neoprene is tough & you can Crazy-Glue any rips. Rubber Hippers are great for pushing through vegetation & creeks.
258844,JohnF,2008-10-16 03:13:00,3494," A couple of us purchased the green CTC boot foot waders and they certainly are durable. The problem is that neither of us can bend over in them. In my case I'd blame it on my fat butt, but Rob's a scrawny little dude and he has the same problem as me. It's rough trying to step up out of rivers and climb banks when you can't bend yer legs.  JF"
258846,danbo,2008-10-16 03:17:00,2646,"Rubber for Hippers, Neoprene for Chesters.. You can modify the Chest Waders by using a stretchy suspenders."
259509,danbo,2008-10-18 11:10:00,2646,
259529,BillM,2008-10-18 16:08:00,17367,I have the green CTC hip waders and they are tough for sure.  No problems thrashing through the bush all summer for specs.  They held up great.
