259102,BillM,2008-10-16 22:39:00,17367,"  Bingo  '99.5 Jetta TDI.  I'll also add that after a few mods, it's been dyno'd at 131whp/251ftlbs..  Stock is 90/155.  Makes it a much funner car to drive, lol.  I also have almost 500,000km's on it.  And a 1000km's on a tank is nothing, I can get her over 1400km's per tank without to much effort."
259105,CLofchik,2008-10-16 22:51:00,854," +1 Especially at the end by Brock Rd. where the limit drops but the flow keeps up to the 1st lights, this has been one of their FAVOURITE fishing holes.  Be especially mindful of the tactic of ""pushing"", unmarked car rides 1' off your bumper trying to push you faster......then busts you.  It's a favourite out that way."
259140,ch312,2008-10-17 01:11:00,1590, i guess im the only one that looks forward to traffic? nothing beats getting paid hourly to sleep on the way to or from work
259152,jedimaster,2008-10-17 01:38:00,3472,"Well we will see what its like tomorow, Depending on when I get out of the house and what it loks like at brock road I may or may not take it...."
259161,Musky or Specks,2008-10-17 01:54:00,2710,LOL I drive back and forth all day from Kitchener to the airport and back. Traffic never bothers me but it can certainly irritate my clients.
259166,GBW,2008-10-17 02:05:00,8460,"Jedi, I have to go to the 401 and Hurontario (area) a few times a month for work from Brooklin (Winchester and Thickson).  Today I left at 6:45 (+ a stop at my local Tim's) and I was there at my office by 8:00 am + or - 5 min.  407 to 410 S to 410 W to Hur. as I'm in one of the tall buildings just off the HWY.  I hope that gives you some idea.  But if you take off after 4 PM to go home you are better off to eat dinner close to work and then get in the car after 6PM to go home.  You get home at the same time but at least you get to relax and eat before you go home rather than spend that whole time behind the wheel... Geoff"
260036,jedimaster,2008-10-20 18:04:00,3472,Well It took me an hour and 10 minutes to go from port perry to Burnhamthorpe and 427 via 407/400/401/409/427 I left my place at 6:50 and got there at 8:00am
260062,GBW,2008-10-20 19:28:00,8460,not bad at all.
260088,Carp,2008-10-20 21:07:00,1488, I'm sure you meant 410 south to 401 west.
260268,GBW,2008-10-21 13:34:00,8460,correct.
260276,lookinforwalleye,2008-10-21 14:08:00,4399,"  That seems like pretty good time, I have made the Brampton/Goreskis run and it`s 70 minutes. The wife and I are thinking of buying a waterfront place near Caesarea and I figure I could do the run in 80 minutes or so, thats a long commute for sure but it`s always been a dream to own a waterfront home."
260297,blue pickeral,2008-10-21 15:13:00,267," Yellowknife eh? You'll need your hair when it dips to 40 below around Xmas and warms up to -20 c at the end of March. Spent 5 years there....As far as driving goes, remember carrying groceries home and having them freeze on the way, or driving, after warming the vehicle for 20 minutes. If you're new to there, highly recommend all synthetic lube productsl!"
260344,daking_eh2007,2008-10-21 16:33:00,31,I take 407 everyday from Brock to 410. Around 8:30am from Donald Cousen to Markham is pretty jammed due to construction approx 10-15mins delay. Hopefully when the road widening is done it will get better. Going back is great because I normally use it around 6:30pm.
260422,Rtrn4Rfnd,2008-10-21 19:57:00,5,"Yup, I too did the whole 400 series scene for years.  Was glad when I moved to Alberta (Fort Mcmurray) a short while ago thinkin i'd be leavin all that traffic behind.  I'm quite confident in saying that this highway 63 is even worse than what i left behind.  Grass is always greener on the other side..."
258663,jedimaster,2008-10-15 19:36:00,3472,"Does anyone drive the 407 in the morning and evening rush? I am looking at a different job, but I would essentially need to drive the 407 from The start at Brock road to 427 in the morning and back on 427 and off at Brock in the evening...anyone have any ideas what the traffic is like and how long it would take to make that drive?"
258697,JohnF,2008-10-15 21:33:00,3494, I think it depends on the time of day.  JF
258702,Mattones,2008-10-15 21:54:00,587,winter is the most traffic. iv never had any traffic on the 407 during spring/summer and fall.
258707,BillM,2008-10-15 21:59:00,17367,What time would you be driving?  If it's early the 401 would be the way to go.
258736,Gerritt,2008-10-15 22:57:00,6129,I drive it daily... from the beginning (403) to the Jane St exit (right after the 400) I have to be @ work for 7:30am and I am done @ 3:30pm. Average travel time for 70km.. 45 minutes give or take. If I got off @ the 427 shave off about 10-15 minutes  Hope this helps!  G
258739,jedimaster,2008-10-15 23:00:00,3472,I would have to hit the 427 by about 8am.... leaving at about 5pm....I know I know peak rush hour what can yah do....  I have noticed that often times the 407 entrance is rammed solid in the mornings when I drive by at brock...
258740,Gerritt,2008-10-15 23:02:00,6129,Feel free to ignore my post... I failed to notice the Brock Rd... that would be making you come West....LOL my bad.
258741,BillM,2008-10-15 23:03:00,17367,"Ugh, those are horrible times to be on any 400 series highway..  I work 7-4 and drive from Barrie > Mississauga.  I just miss the traffic."
258742,Gerritt,2008-10-15 23:15:00,6129,  We're lucky men Bill
258768,vance,2008-10-16 00:50:00,719,"I drive the 407 in the rush hour from brock some days to and past the 427,traffic on the 407 is not a problem getting to it and off it is the problem.The roads at either end are the problem as there is PLENTY of  traffic already on those roads.I use a couple of short cuts on either end to speed up my travels and leave a few minutes early in the morning to avoid hassles.   vance"
258770,mikemo,2008-10-16 00:59:00,27,"I usually take it for about 10 km from Donald Cousens Parkway to Warden.  I get on a during peak time - between 8 and 8:30 - and it's pretty congested.  It's not quite stop and go, but there are some very slow spots until it opens up to 3 lanes at Markham Road (Hwy 48).   Once i'm past that it's quick.  One the way home it starts to get congested around McCowan as it goes to 2 lanes.  The good news is they're adding or widening the lanes there east of 48 too. I haven't gone past Woodbine so I can't say how bad it is further west."
258772,DRIFTER_016,2008-10-16 01:01:00,10439,I couldn't stand that traffic any more so I got the heck outta dodge!!!!!! I now have a 10 minute commute during rush hour...............er minute!! I even head home for lunch something I haven't done since the early 80's. Life is good again. Since I moved here I no longer have stress..........I think I even have a new hair or two growing in!!!!!!
258943,Kirk,2008-10-16 14:57:00,347,"I take the 407 99% of the time, regardless of the time of day, its always faster than 401.  Even off peak times...less cars on the 407 = less idiot drivers = 407 as the 24 hour a day preference for me.  Rush hours can be stop and go on the 407 but it still would be moving faster than the 401 parking lot.  I don't know if my perma grin can be seen from this post since Canada got a nice blue line on the 14th.  I think traffic will be improved, as well as everything else, under PC management."
258944,Raf,2008-10-16 15:00:00,3495,ahh the perx of living in the core and travelling to the burbs for work.  all the traffic going the other way.  i'll wave as I go by.
258947,tizfun,2008-10-16 15:11:00,292,Has anyone thought of the costs..  I used to take the 407 from Brock Rd to Airport Rd everyday (155 kms round trip) and it cost me around $20.00 round trip.. Multiply this by 5 days or 6 days if I had to go in on the weekend and that's 120.00/week plus driving my Chevy Trailblazer filling that up $75.00 every 3 days..  In all I was spending about 1300.00/month on the 407/gas just to get to work..  For a short time I was running 2500 kms month on the 407..  They even sent me a gas card from Petro to save 2 cents a litre on 100 litres of fuel....  Never again !!!!!  Tiz
258953,Bob,2008-10-16 15:35:00,370,"I feel for you guys.  I used to drive DVP, 401, 400 to Finch on my way to work. No 407 then and old hwy 7 was slow.  I don't suppose there was as much traffic on the 401 in those days but sometimes DVP was a parking lot.  Now I see rush minute occasionally and having to wait for 6 cars to go by before I get through an intersection is our version of a traffic jam.  Been 35 years since I escaped the rat race and I love it. I can fish and hunt 10 minutes from my door.  Am I trying to make you jealous?"
258954,bigugli,2008-10-16 15:35:00,6138,I got out of the commuter rat race when the costs hit $700 a month some 15 years back. That was when gas was .35 a litre and there was no toll road. Hate to think of how much cash some of you fellas burn now
258958,BillM,2008-10-16 15:43:00,17367,Fuel costs me about $50-60 per week.  Not to bad considering it's over 1000km's per week just for work and back.
258962,bigugli,2008-10-16 15:52:00,6138,"Must be driving a wee 3 banger or such.  2 full tanks a week in the van per week to do that commute today would be $200 + $60 for parking, let alone tolls. My mechanic got to see me every month for the oil change and check-up. I think I paid for his new boat"
258979,Raf,2008-10-16 17:00:00,3495,i'm guessing tdi.
259041,jedimaster,2008-10-16 19:18:00,3472,"I drive about 120km's round trip per day, but a new job would net me around 210km's round trip per day, but the increase in salary would be well worth it. What time does the 407 start to jam up in the morning at Brock road? Ideally I woul dlike to negotiate and early start and leave time if it gets to that point, but that time would be dependant on the traffic flow. If I was entering the 407 at say 7:20am at brock would that get me past the traffic to the 427?"
259055,mikemo,2008-10-16 19:46:00,27,I can't help you about that time.  If I'm on the road that early I take the other ways in as they're pretty good.  I guess it'd be fine though.  Even when I get on when it's congested it's a huge time saver for me and I'm not going far.
259056,fishing n autograph,2008-10-16 20:00:00,2540,"I drive the 407 daily from Milton to the 400...i have VERY rarely had a slow down and always make good time. Don't worry about time, worry about the cost lol..."
259078,ozaibak1,2008-10-16 21:19:00,401,"I moved from driving, to taking the subway, to walking. I now have a 10 minute walk to work which is great. Even when driving, I was against traffic and it was still brutal. IMO its not worth the added stress to commute on that hellhole. This factor is huge for any future job opportunities for me, as important as money! I find I end up wanting to smash things when I'm stuck in traffic, couldn't imagine doing that daily."
259083,Paully,2008-10-16 21:47:00,712,If you dont mind paying... 407 is the way to go. The only time i hit traffic is when some moron plows into someone! P.S ... watch out for the OPP.. the avg. speed is 130 - 140 in the fast lane.
