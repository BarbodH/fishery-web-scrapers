258628,GBW,2008-10-15 17:02:00,8460,"Hey all.  Well, the 2nd last time I had my 7' rod in the van it got broken (as some of you may recall from another post) and over the long weekend it almost happened again.  So I think to be safe I better get a case that can hold 8 or so rods with reels.  I like the one at BPS the BPS caddy but I'm not sure how good it is.  Also, BPS is not close to me to make the trip just for that item.  Any recommendations for another product like this at that price point?  I generally pack 6 rod and reel set up's when I go out too.  Thanks.  Geoff"
258655,bassjnkie,2008-10-15 19:04:00,1101,"The caddy is not heaviley padded at all. Truthfully, it's like wrapping you rods in a sheet. I think the browning one has more protection.  http://www.basspro.com/webapp/wcs/stores/s...0004000_100-4-2"
258675,Wild,2008-10-15 20:47:00,704,From all the reviews your not going to be happy with a soft case. Why not make a special rack that will hold the rods on the inside roof of the van?
258677,GBW,2008-10-15 20:48:00,8460,"Now that I look at it your right about the sheet thing.  The other unit isn't bad but the reviews are also not good when the unit is extended.  This is just for me to protect everything from my wife, kids and dog in the van.  And going to BPS just for that isn't worth it...  Anyone else?"
258678,GBW,2008-10-15 20:50:00,8460,"That's an option but the one I found that I thought was good, you had to drill in place.  All others that I have found so far cause you to not be able to see out of your rearview mirror..."
258692,Wild,2008-10-15 21:27:00,704,Yes you either have to drill or have some tabs welded. Fine for me as it's a DIY project.  The only other solution is to buy a bazooka case @ lebaron or make a PVC tubes. I have plans for a wooden case but then again it's DIY.
258859,GBW,2008-10-16 04:06:00,8460,"Is there anyway you can share those plans with me for the wooden case?  The van is gone in a year so I would rather not make the mod's to it if that's the case (no punn intended)...  Oh and I checked LeBaron's site today and they currently do not have any of the fishing items up as the site is being updated, but thanks.  Let me know when you can about the DIY wood case, cheers. Geoff"
259062,Smitty1,2008-10-16 20:11:00,29,Have a look at this product at Cabelas...  Boat BuckleÂ® RodBunk Deluxe Rod Carrier  It sounds like it would fit in your mini van...  Good luck Smitty
259137,Wild,2008-10-17 00:59:00,704,I's a simple case that opens full length but only stores rods. I guess ends could be modified for reels but are you an experienced woodworker?
259159,GBW,2008-10-17 01:51:00,8460," Thanks Smitty   Yes and no Wild.  I have made a few blanket & toy boxes so I gather the dimensions chance and type of wood products as well as liner so I can give it a valid try as I have the tools and understanding.  Let me know via PM if you want to or here in the open as to what it is you are thinking of.  Even if it costs me more to make I'm all for it as it's something I made and would be happy with rather than buy and by disappointed with. Cheers, Geoff"
259169,Wild,2008-10-17 02:10:00,704,Sure this will be a great winter project and anything from a basic case to a really nice one can be made.Even custom storage stands. I have to dig up the plans and convert to CAD either that or start a custom drawing from scratch.
259198,GBW,2008-10-17 03:31:00,8460,"Let me know what you come up with as I am very interested, and thanks!"
259634,Wild,2008-10-19 00:36:00,704,"I was thinking about this and a nice carbon fiber case will also be made, I will also work on the mold for it during the white days."
259883,GBW,2008-10-20 01:22:00,8460,Nice!  Let's keep in touch via the PM we have going on the wood box.  Cheers.
