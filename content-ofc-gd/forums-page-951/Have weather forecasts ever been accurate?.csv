The weather forecast said it was going to rain 15~20mm on Tuesday so I quicky booked Friday off to find some steelies ... guess what ... It says it will not rain until Saturday ... Needless to say, I cancelled my vacation and am now hestitated to book Monday off .."

Years back there was this invisible weather line through Hammy Harbour. Blue skies  from burlington to Oshawa, and snow from Hamilton down.  The weather man kept predicting blue skies. He wasn't wrong and he wasn't quite right."
