260234,pikehunter,2008-10-21 11:35:00,1659,You hit it on the head Bigugli.  I really thought that people would get it when it was driven into our heads at young ages by doing clean ups around the town. Hopefully though it sunk into a few people and they have remembered what it was like to clean up after others.  Good idea on the charity.
260394,1Harringtona,2008-10-21 18:15:00,77, great idea dad ... maybe we should dispose of our old windows that way lol
260470,holdfast,2008-10-21 22:30:00,1813," Yup I see your point about the spread of paying for fishing.  Can be like a disease.  Any ways I thought that I will tell ya a little secret.  Its called fishing in Camp Borden.  Maybe Terry and Fisherman can get you some connections to get you fishing in there.  All you need to do is Join the Rod and Gun Club which is a small fee.  There is even a trout pond there.  Think of it.  A beer at the NCOs club, Fitness room, Pool, Taking the family to a cheap meal at the mess.  I'm sure through your connections you can get in.  If not I'M sure a Meat head will sponsor you and there is the odd cop that flies helicopters for 400 Tac Sqn.  Anyways you can fish some of the best pools for trout and Salmon in the area.  No Civies to bother you either.  There is a Civie that works at Range Control who is an excellent guy that will tell ya where the pools are. Check it out"
260511,Fisherman,2008-10-22 00:08:00,7201,"Ha, ha, ha, Meathead will sponsor you, and the civvy that works at Range Control, ha, ha, ha, ya, all those secret little pools, Deer Feeder, down behind the Cadet Camp, Tioga, hmmm any more..must be pointing at me.  In all honesty, I only counted a handful of salmon this year, one of which was in the jaws of an Otter with his mate swimming alongside.  If it's any indication of the years to come, I think the salmon fishery is pretty much pooched in the Notty/Pine.  Even the rainbow are hiding somewhere else this year."
260539,Scott S,2008-10-22 01:49:00,203,That's because you have a salmon derby that take's spawning salmon from the river and replace it with what!!! At least other salmon derby's proceeds go back to stocking more salmon back into the system. You can only take so much until there is nothing left. My two cents worth Scooter.
260544,BillM,2008-10-22 02:15:00,17367,The Pine is to small to sustain a salmon fishery anyhow.. Leave the Pine for the bows and the odd monster brookie.
260159,StoneFly,2008-10-21 00:33:00,574,"All I can say is WOW to all of those comments.  I have fished alot of the Upper Notty including some places in Essa and I know abuot the location being reffered to and to my knowledge it is the only parking spot in the whole town that posts the sign about the $40.  I only went there once and didnt even fish mainly due to the crowds.  If the fee is for garbage pick up (pigs), then I would like to know if there is a garbage can or several with signs posted above them to please place you trash in the bin or you will be charged $500???.  Never in my life have I thrown a peice of trash into the environment and certainly not on a river bank while fishing.  I have however diven into other more secluded locations in Essa which dont see many fisherman at all, but have also seen big piles of garbage along the back paths to get in there that were abviously dumped by a commercial contractor of some sort to avoid his landfill/transfer station fee's and I can bet that this had nothing to do with fishing.  5 cubic yards of garbage in 30 sq. ft,....I would have to think adds up to more than a few timmies cups on the ground.  Not that I am condening any type of littering, but for fisherman to pay that much for a minute amount of garbage considering Bill or Tonys carpentry are the ones doing the damage, seems a little unjust to me.  Why doesnt Essa just instate a Martial law by-law and give someone the right to discipline the bumpkin that is polluting...lol"
260187,Fisherman,2008-10-21 01:27:00,7201,"Only one problem, where do you want us to ""dump"" the dead bumpkins, far too many for our cemeteries..we would have to take them someplace else to dump.  BTW, this is not the only place, have you ever travelled Cooks Bay on a sunday afternoon during the hardwater season, garbage, wine bottles, beer bottles, 50lb bag of potatoes half peeled, bunch of Winos that couldn't take their crud back home because the were probably too blitzed."
260193,luv2drift,2008-10-21 01:38:00,147,"That 's more like it ! Finally some passion coming on this thread.  I like what Terry said about the ATVs.  Fisherman, I was wondering way back at the start of this post, you said by-law guys read this  ...just wondering if anyone of them want to throw their two cents in or should I say their 4000 cents."
260221,pikehunter,2008-10-21 09:02:00,1659,"Looks like some of you are just as thick between the ears if you can't see the sarcasm in my comment. Guess some don't see sarcasm or irony as humour. Lighten up will ya! Geesh!  Oh well... at least I added a couple of logs to the fire.  I don't agree with fees, but then again maybe the idiots that leave a mess behind everywhere they go will wake up when they are hit in the wallet. I see this problem anywhere I go. It doesn't matter if it is public property, a private park or boat launch, people just don't give a damn!  If I had a nickel for every Tim Horton's cup left behind on a store shelf, park, sidewalk or fishing area that I've picked up.  Maybe I am pretty thick between the ears because I honestly thought that all those class trips we made back in grade school to pick up garbage around Burlington, the times my son went out on the same missions when he was in grade school or the kids groups I myself led in the townhouse complex where we used to live to pick up litter would make a difference in peoples conscience. Guess I was wrong. There are still too many slobs around.  I also heard a couple of years ago that the school litter clean up days ended because some ""parent"" didn't feel their kid should be picking up trash. WTH!"
260229,bigugli,2008-10-21 11:17:00,6138," In a lot of schools, environmental action has gone the way of the Dodo. As for trash cleanups, that is now a punishment reserved for those on detention.  It all depends upon whether the staff actually care any more or if  they are just marking time until pension day.  As for the average Canadian they don't really care, unless someone cleans up for them. The dogs and I just came in from the morning walk and, surprise surprise, we've picked up another full bag of pop cans in the neighbourhood. Just like we do every day, anywhere we go.  And to answer a question I get all too often, I don't pick up all the trash in view for 3 reasons. The walk would be very short after filling the bag in the first 2 blocks. Secondly. I would have to pay a $1 a bag to dispose of all these bags of garbage, or excess bags of recycling.  Third, the cans get recycled at the scrap yard and the funds have gone into several worthwhile youth projects over the past 8 years ( the beer empties fuel my boat  ). Besides some people are getting paid to, supposedly, keep our streets and parks clean.  As I've already said, We anglers are an easier target to find when we make a mess. Worm boxes, fishing line and lure pkging  are dead give aways. So we become the scapegoat. We just have to police ourselves better, or face further loss."
258589,solopaddler,2008-10-15 15:27:00,8605,"Maybe in my younger days I might have tried to get away without paying the fee, maybe. Not Anymore. I'm married now, have 2 young kids who depend and look up to me, mortgage, car payments, stock market crash, headaches and responsibilities ad nauseum. Why in Gods green earth would I want to put myself in a position where I might be charged with something? I wouldn't. It's totally not worth the hassle even if the charge is bogus and can be beaten."
258605,Mike Pike,2008-10-15 16:20:00,1332,"$40 to clean up garbage?  I thought that's what local taxes were for.  Oh well, I haven't fished there for years and with the fee, I won't fish there in the years ahead either."
258330,LeXXington,2008-10-14 20:45:00,1928,Kind of odd.. to say don't come spend your money in my town..  Oh well moving on
258333,bassjnkie,2008-10-14 20:53:00,1101,"I AM SOOO GLAD!! I stopped fishing rivers/trout 4 years ago. I have to agree that $40 is bull. How about a protest I will sign it, and i am sure we can get alot more to sign just on this board. Here's a thought, don't fish it and save your $40 for gas to another trib. That's life, quick buck  Daniel"
258334,bigfish1965,2008-10-14 20:58:00,3382,"No one can introduce fishing restrictions outside of the feds and province. No fees, no rules, no anything. Period. Municipalities are laden with illegal restrictions. Many small towns do not put their bylaws in front of a lawyer first. They can't afford it. my mother is a former town councilor and now is the by-law enforcement officer and I've read their bylaws...many of them are totally unenforcable. She knows it and doesn't write tickets on them. There is nothing wrong with challenging a bylaw you find illegal or offensive. Just know the risks involved. It is not up to the anglers to pay for the clean up of everyone. If they want to pass a land use bylaw making EVERYONE pay 40 bucks to be there, that would be legal. The town of Niagara-on-the-Lake made a bylaw banning fishing from a local public dock. Result..unenforcable and not enforced. The reason was the same..littering. So, logic says if you cannot enforce littering laws, which near a waterway can be a major offense, HOW THE HECK CAN YOU ENFORCE A NEW AND DUMBER LAW! You don't need more laws if others are not being followed, you need greater enforcement of the existing laws. I will gladly put my name and picture to that statement. Do not let municipalities tread on your rights unchallenged. Ask for a delegation at the next town council meeting and tell them. If we let it go quietly, others will follow. The water is federal gov't property and we have already paid for the right to fish it. I was a Fish and Wildlife Guardian with the MNR for years and this was made very clear. Municipalities do not usurp the province...ever."
258340,misfish,2008-10-14 21:15:00,29133,"Thanks Rick,for the time and the input."
258345,aniceguy,2008-10-14 21:24:00,1094,"Municipal by laws have teeth, essa's fees are 10 for a day or 40 for the year but they are for access to city owned parks, they are not for the right to fish the Notty, and as such can and are enforced by by law enforcement"
258347,luv2drift,2008-10-14 21:28:00,147,"aniceguy...kudos   can you clearify a few points for me.  1. The area in question should be ""navigable"" because there is a well established tourist canoe route. 2.  Ok forget the shoreline lets assume its all private.  What about an angler who waded into the designated area?  As you know the signs for the trespass to property act have several conditions they must adhere to. 3.  There are conflicting subjects surrounding the issue.  It seems it is written that land owners can be charged and users of the water can be charged??? 4. A fee to access the land and fish the river vs a fee to fish the river. If I access the land which Essa Township owns and I walk down with a back pack on and wade out to the middle of the river and don't start the act of fishing until in the middle of the river than I should be fine?  If I walk down to the shoreline and shore fish I am trespassing? 5.  In order to lay charges, there must be some significant evidence recorded by the person laying the charge...you can beat a speeding ticket if the copper doesn't know the speed of sound! 6. 40 bucks vs 50 bucks for the trespass ...I'll take the chance I might go tomorrow..hahaha"
258349,Fisherman,2008-10-14 21:32:00,7201,"Nice research, so in other words the $40  fee does appear to be legal, and, the high water mark myth doesn't hold a lot of water(except during the spring flood   ).  So unless you want to walk down the side of the river(feet in water), looks like this is legal.   I would much rather see something like a Township access permit for those who live in Essa Twp,  other municipalities do likewise for access to boat launches and parks like Innisfil, and Oro 9th line if I'm not mistaken.  Maybe Brian knows if they charge at the Barrie Marina for Barrie City residents to launch&retrieve.  I'm sure if they took 2 cents from every ESSA property owners tax bill, they would more than equal the amount they spend on the administration of tickets, making, distributing, revenue, etc.  And lets keep it civil and not nasty, there's something to be learned here."
258353,Fisherman,2008-10-14 21:36:00,7201,"luv2drift, there's about 7 or 8 log jams just north of # 90 to the swamp, and once into the swamp there's a few more around the Willow, so big it would take many kilo's of C-4, DM12, or what it takes to blow it up.  My neighbours been in there a number of times, it's impossible to navigate any distance now."
258354,luv2drift,2008-10-14 21:39:00,147,Well I guess you should go and take everyone's 40 bucks and clear them OUT!!! because it is a designated tourist canoe route and I have the book to prove it!  Let's go chop chop  or use the C4 what ever
258357,Fisherman,2008-10-14 21:46:00,7201,"I know one of the other fellow up the street made mention of this to the NVCA/Fishing Derby and they were totally unaware that the river had been ""plugged up"" by mother nature, from his story, he lead me to believe ""it's not their job"" to make sure the river can be used for canoe or other boat travel.   Man, it would take an army(air force or navy don't count) to chop chop their way through that mess and then pull it up on the banks.  There's a couple spots, it's so high you can't even come close to seeing over top of the pile of trees, and probably a couple hundred feet long.  I know you're right about the canoe route designation."
258365,Terry,2008-10-14 22:09:00,14456,if I go with 6 people and I am the only one that has a fishing rod....are they only going to charge me the 40 bucks....I think I can easily beat that......
257530,Gerritt,2008-10-11 15:27:00,6129,"  Well.... I would expect an officer (you) to follow the law.. even if he or she does not agree with it... how many times have the police asked fishermen to leave certain shore spots? TONS! think of Bronte harbour.. while technically they are not in violation of the FEDERAL waterway act.. they would rather just end the situation as easily as possible, besides municipalities enact their own bylaws in regards to their shorelines.. this does not mean they trump Federal statutes however...  I would expect alot more from an officer of the peace to be quite frank.  What other laws do you feel like breaking today? Speeding, robbery, Assault?  No wonder many folks look at officers with disdain.   PS... it is Real Estate and Trespass. G."
