Launch is at the marina in downtown Barrie, blastoff is at 7:30am, weigh-in is at 3:00pm.  $120.00 per team plus an optional $20.00 big fish pool.  It is a 4 fish limit, and despite the name of the event, it is not restricted to the bay, the entire lake is open .  Should be a good payout.  Hope to see a few of you out there!  More info can be found at www.barriebassmasters.org"
