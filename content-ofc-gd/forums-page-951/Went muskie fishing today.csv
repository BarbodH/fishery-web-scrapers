259895,glen,2008-10-20 02:10:00,2641,I went out for a little troll in the Kawarthas today.  Beautiful day out but cool even with the sunshine.  Saw a big rock just under the water with what looked like a prop blade laying there.  So i am thinking at least i get to net some thing.  I scoop it up and it is a piece of a skeg as big as your hand.   So i mark that spot and keep trolling.  Just when i am thinking its a nice day even if i dont get a muskie i hear the clicker on the penn 209  go off.  I know i am in 16' of water so i dont think it is a snag.  I grab the rod real quick.  O ya baby good fish.  Its pulling drag and head shaking.  She cleared the water a few times with an awesome show and i thought she might throw the hook. After a good fight a very fat fish is in the net. Please insert picture of a large and mean muskie here.  She released excellent to fight another day. Sorry about the lack of pics i was fishing alone.
