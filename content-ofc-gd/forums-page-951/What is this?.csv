As i walked to vehicle to leave, i stopped to watch seagulls peck the eyes out of rotting salmon. While i stood there, out of my peripheral i could see something silently walking towards me. Grabbed  my camera and took this pic.  Never seen one of these before."
260313,anders,2008-10-21 15:36:00,1168,"I am pretty certain looking at the picture with the black legs and yellow beak that, that is a great egret.  http://www.naturephoto-cz.com/great-white-...-photo-491.htmlundefined"
260327,BillM,2008-10-21 16:08:00,17367,"Yup, egret for sure, it's in the heron family..."
260368,bigugli,2008-10-21 17:31:00,6138,"They nest regularly along the Niagara R.  Would not be surprised, with changing weather patterns, if their migration range is slowly expanding."
260373,timmeh,2008-10-21 17:41:00,609,I agree that it's an egret. I have started to notice them along the middle sections of the Grand River.
260376,snag,2008-10-21 17:47:00,1932, Does nobody find this just a little disturbing?    LOL
260382,Leecher,2008-10-21 17:59:00,7832,Yeap.... definitely an egret
260389,Stoty,2008-10-21 18:10:00,2910,a white bird!

260410,bigugli,2008-10-21 18:59:00,6138,What a waste of good perch bait.
260412,ccmtcanada,2008-10-21 19:00:00,7971, 
260414,Terry,2008-10-21 19:18:00,14456,I hear they taste good
260446,JohnF,2008-10-21 21:21:00,3494, Egrets or fisheyes?  JF
260482,ehg,2008-10-21 22:48:00,2666,"Looks like a Great White Egret, thanks for link anders nice pictures there.  Read a little today that they are expanding there range north and eastward. Like the cardinal did 100 yrs. ago and Turkey Vulture 25 yrs. ago."
260514,hammercarp,2008-10-22 00:15:00,964,Eyes. Hows this one. I was at Bronte a few years back and there was a dead chinook by the rock pile on the east side. A hen mallard began pecking at it. As I watching she discovered something good in the salmons distended vent. I was a female salmon. The hen mallard shoved her bill into the salmon and kept shoving til she was buried in it to her eyeballs. I wish I had a camera for that one.
