259346,Squid,2008-10-17 16:33:00,1656,I will be going to Corwall in a week from now and I am so excited that I was sitting in my boat last night looking over the map of Lake St.Francis for areas that I consider to hold Muskies. Waypoints were marked and I have to do now is wait for the 24th to roll around.  I will be there from Saturday the 25th until the 29th or 30th. I have plans to fish with my brother on the 25 th and 26th but I am free from the 27th to the 29th. If anyone wants to hop in with me on any of those days you are most welocme to join me. Send me a PM with your phone number and I will make every attempt to hook up with you.  Pete
