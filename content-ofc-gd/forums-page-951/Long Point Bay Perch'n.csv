The fishing wasn't nearly as good as last weekend for size but we did manage about 35 keepers with the biggest only being 9"". Ended up catching tons of 3-4""ers that kept stealing our bait. We were between St. Williams and Port Rowan in about 5.5' of water.   We tried out at EC10 for a bit but only caught a couple small ones and it was too rough to venture out to Bluff Bar. I know next weekend the heater is coming to warm up our hands. It was COLD!"
