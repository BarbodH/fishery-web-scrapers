259884,tbayboy,2008-10-20 01:26:00,1497,"Been a while since I posted but I got out today for a suprisingly good couple hours so I thought I'd gather up the last few weeks and roll them into one report so pack it up, pack it in, let us begin!  Simcoe Bronze The first weekend in October Mike and I went out for a last day on Georgian Bay.  We caught a couple but nothing great and we talked about jumping on the Simcoe Smallie bandwagon after seeing all the great reports.  Mike got some tips while I read every report I could (love this board) and we headed out for an early start.  Of course being on new water using techniques you're not use to (deep water bass fishing) took some getting use to but just before noon Mike yanked back on his crank bait and we were in the game  <a href=""   title=""One last dig by Sean Maurik, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3273/2917011946_655befdb02.jpg"" width=""484"" height=""500"" alt=""One last dig"" /></a>  She came in at 4lbs pretty much on the dot  <a href=""   title=""Fat 4 pounder by Sean Maurik, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3255/2917012750_c804e3b7de_b.jpg"" width=""1024"" height=""1006"" alt=""Fat 4 pounder"" /></a>  Unfortunately we didn't get much else after that - my bass tactics were really paying off  <a href=""   title=""My Bass? by Sean Maurik, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3060/2917013478_dfe157cb90.jpg"" width=""500"" height=""465"" alt=""My Bass?"" /></a>  But on the other side of things the perch were crazy so we spent the last couple hours pulling up perch after perch while we planned the Thanksgiving weekend attack on Simcoe.  <a href=""   title=""Calm on the bay by Sean Maurik, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3018/2936751588_9e3994bf6e_b.jpg"" width=""1024"" height=""768"" alt=""Calm on the bay"" /></a>  Saturday the 11th started off cool and calm, beautiful day but you know it's October when this is the decor for the 50MPH run to the fishing spots  <a href=""   title=""Ready for takeoff! by Sean Maurik, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3274/2935897351_868484ca70.jpg"" width=""375"" height=""500"" alt=""Ready for takeoff!"" /></a>  <a href=""   title=""Ready for takeoff! by Sean Maurik, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3237/2936753444_73ba069ca2.jpg"" width=""500"" height=""354"" alt=""Ready for takeoff!"" /></a>   This weekend Mike didn't waste much time and landing this 4 1/4 pounder at our first stop, nice fish.  <a href=""   title=""First of the day by Sean Maurik, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3207/2935898783_af22babf4b_b.jpg"" width=""1024"" height=""846"" alt=""First of the day"" /></a>  A couple hours later he followed it up with another slightly smaller sample  <a href=""   title=""Mike's 4 and 1/2 by Sean Maurik, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3245/2935900215_37ceb43023_b.jpg"" width=""768"" height=""1024"" alt=""Mike's 4 and 1/2"" /></a>  Then it happened!  My first simcoe smallie, what a beast!  <a href=""   title=""Simcoe Smallie by Sean Maurik, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3061/2936756720_a62e509c47.jpg"" width=""500"" height=""443"" alt=""Simcoe Smallie"" /></a>  We went back again Sunday but had nothing but a couple 1 pounders to show for it.  So yeah, Simcoe kicked my ass, I'll admit it   but I'll be back next year, gotta catch up with Mike sometime!  Technical Details All of Mike's fish came on a deep diving crawfish patterned crank bait in 15'ish feet of water with deep water near by.  Water temps were 58-60 degree.  Hangover Piggies This weekend I didn't make any fishing plans as it was Oktoberfest.  I got on the bus at 5:30pm Saturday and got home at 4am - 'nuff said about that night, Ein Prosit!.  Needless to say I wasn't up particularly early but after a gallon of coffee and some brunch I found myself feeling more or less alive and bored at 2pm.  I looked outside and damn , wasn't it a nice looking day.  Figured a drive would help clear the cobwebs so I tossed the waders in the trunk and headed back to Kitchener for a different kind of celebrating.  <a href=""   title=""Grand river in the fall by Sean Maurik, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3270/2955969483_b47e3dd6db_b.jpg"" width=""1024"" height=""768"" alt=""Grand river in the fall"" /></a>  The water was beautiful, calm and clear when I arrived at 3:45.  Damn cold though - I had on long underwear and thick socks but I gotta invest in some neoprene's some time, brrr. I'd put on a tube and started tossing into the deepest water I could find and wouldn't you know it - I get a big heavy fish on 10 minutes into the day.  Unfortunately I didn't set the hook and she pulled it out.    .  I figured that was going to the be only hit of the day after doing something that dumb but nope - not 10 minutes later I get another pick up but this time I gave it a couple good yanks then another for good measure.  <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/emosworld/2955966057/"" title=""First of the day by Sean Maurik, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3142/2955966057_80f06a3473_b.jpg"" width=""616"" height=""1024"" alt=""First of the day"" /></a>  This girl wasn't coming off and boy was I glad she didn't, a nice fattie was soon in my hands, too bad I didn't bring along a camera man  <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/emosworld/2956810368/"" title=""First little piggy by Sean Maurik, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3180/2956810368_5a399f88ee_b.jpg"" width=""768"" height=""1024"" alt=""First little piggy"" /></a>  A couple casts later I had another hit, this time I gave a bit too much of a pull on the hookset and had to dodge an incoming tube in a hurry, whoops.  Luckily it didn't take long to get another try - another nice fish!  <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/emosworld/2956810656/"" title=""Second in the half hour by Sean Maurik, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3052/2956810656_b77065d774_b.jpg"" width=""749"" height=""1024"" alt=""Second in the half hour"" /></a>  The next fish was the smallest of the day:  <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/emosworld/2956812250/"" title=""Where'd he go? by Sean Maurik, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3283/2956812250_3dac316d4c.jpg"" width=""500"" height=""375"" alt=""Where'd he go?"" /></a>  In case you're wondering - that's where the fish was 2 seconds earlier, just before I dropped it trying to get the camera out  But that was ok since piggie number 3 showed up to make it a VERY productive half hour  <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/emosworld/2955967457/"" title=""3rd in the half hour by Sean Maurik, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3271/2955967457_0113a48335_b.jpg"" width=""768"" height=""1024"" alt=""3rd in the half hour"" /></a>   Then I got all stupid and decided to take off the tube and try some other things (topwater, jerk baits) - sometimes I wonder what goes through my head.  Needless to say that was a waste of 45 minutes.  By the time that experiment ended my finger tips were cold, my nose was running and my feet were going numb.  So I put the tube back on and managed one last fish for the day  <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/emosworld/2955968907/"" title=""Last of the season? by Sean Maurik, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3290/2955968907_f73449a69a_b.jpg"" width=""768"" height=""1024"" alt=""Last of the season?"" /></a>  Took a couple scenery pics as the sun set and called it a day, perhaps the last on the Grand this year ?  <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/emosworld/2955970401/"" title=""Colours reflected by Sean Maurik, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3192/2955970401_036d003a6a_b.jpg"" width=""768"" height=""1024"" alt=""Colours reflected"" /></a>  <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/emosworld/2956814466/"" title=""Sunset on the grand by Sean Maurik, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3007/2956814466_8cb53482db_b.jpg"" width=""1024"" height=""768"" alt=""Sunset on the grand"" /></a>  Technical Details Pretty easy one this time around: <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/emosworld/2956811730/"" title=""Todays tools by Sean Maurik, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3278/2956811730_663c397c65.jpg"" width=""500"" height=""438"" alt=""Todays tools"" /></a>  8lb fireline crystal on a trusty Shimano Sahara and my St. Croix 6'6'' medium fast with a brown/flaked 3 1/2"" tube  tossed into the deepest holes I could find (5-6' of water for the most part).  Now comes that lousy time - waiting for the hard water season - take care everyone Sean"
