Musky was out target . 12 hours of casting a few pike finally I caught this musky right before dark. She ate a topwater on a figure 8- had 2 feet of line out! Everything was fine until she jumped boatside putting the first 5/0 treble through my thumb. After a few choice words for the camera, we cut the hook out and took a quick pic and back she went...    caught some bass as well...   Just got some pics from the crew down in Baja Mexico. They hooked a 300 pound blue marlin which they battled for 4.5 hours . The line broke and the might fish swam away.    Later on Ken Whiting hooked and landed this beautiful 110 pound striped Marlin     The film has taken the crew to Boca Grande, Florida for tarpon. Alaska for Halibut, California and in the Ottawa area. ONe last segment to film for striped bass out of the east coast. DVD will be released this coming spring  www.kayakfishingmovie.com ( more photos and video trailer available!)"
