Hawg Hunter"
259279,Billy - Curtiss,2008-10-17 13:45:00,241,My friends and I are also old-school and use sticks as well! We mainly ice fish for lakers and run 80 lb braid.
259288,Leecher,2008-10-17 14:06:00,7832,I use wooden tipups that I make myself rigged with reels and 40lbs braid Here's a few pics      Leechman
259290,Sinker,2008-10-17 14:12:00,8692,P-line fluoroclear for everything. 2lb for perch all the way up to 12lb for jigging the big fish.  Sinker
259306,DANIMAL,2008-10-17 14:47:00,215,"Braid, I prefer Power Pro. It does freeze, but no other type if line straightens out better to get maximum feel out of a light bait."
259340,jeffw,2008-10-17 16:18:00,267,Power pro and and bass pro regular mon. Always use a flouro leader.
259347,rhare,2008-10-17 16:34:00,387,"I use a 6lbs thor ultra, for lakers and whities on a thorne bros rod with a  2500 stradic.  Ive used all sorts of line and this has produced the best results for me by far.  light enough to let a small williams fall to the bottom in 120fow, and strong enough to handle a big laker."
259413,PAZE,2008-10-17 21:21:00,132,"any line thats 6-8 lbs test, any line."
259484,kuhaman,2008-10-18 02:41:00,503,Agreed
259490,skeeter,2008-10-18 03:43:00,1907,80lb-50lb-40lb??????? i didnt know you guys were fishing in the ocean!!! when you set the hook on a perch does anything but the lips come up???
259498,Dabluz,2008-10-18 05:20:00,701,"For fresh water fish I use 4 to 8 lb test mono if in shallow water or 6 to 10 lb test Fireline in deeper water.  For deep saltwater fishing in the Saguenay River, I use 30 and 40 lb braid and for ocean perch in deep water I use 14 lb test Fireline.  I use spinning and baitcasting reels on short home made rods."
259513,johnnyb,2008-10-18 12:54:00,3413,"Power pro on the jigging rod (15# diameter, 30#test), and good ol' black dacron on the gad -- which is my willow twig tip-up."
259514,bigugli,2008-10-18 13:05:00,6138,4-6lb ice line on the jigging rods and good old black cord on the tip-up.
260137,brkygetr,2008-10-20 23:46:00,425,same line I use for everything else...6 lb. Ande dark green
260179,kemper,2008-10-21 01:04:00,2232,  Im interested in how you ice fish salt water?
260180,Mattones,2008-10-21 01:13:00,587,haha oh man at Wal-mart on Friday night i was in the fishing area and saw these 2 foot rods i was like 'hey Natasha its your rod but 10x smaller'' then she said it was for ice fishing so i looked at the tag and it was.
