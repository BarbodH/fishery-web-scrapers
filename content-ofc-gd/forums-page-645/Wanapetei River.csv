I seem to catch big Walleye and some smallies as big as 4pounds. But, I have not caught a pike there yet, which is totally opposite to the norm. If you have any tips please share."

Take a look at Allen Lake, near the mouth of the river and you will find plenty of pike... big one's well I'll leave that up to you. The river is quite small, more of a creek at the Killarney road... you might get a canoe down it... maybe. HH"
