493745,rhymobot,2010-08-12 02:20:00,174,Saw it at Ken Whillans Resource Management Area in Caledon. It was doing better than I was.     
493751,kickingfrog,2010-08-12 02:32:00,8333,"I'm not as sharp on my birds as I once was, but I'll say American bittern."
493755,Dave Bailey,2010-08-12 02:44:00,1641,"Green heron, Butorides virescens."
493756,jediangler,2010-08-12 02:49:00,1923,"I'm with Dave on this one, Green Heron. I see them sometimes at Guelph lake."
493779,singingdog,2010-08-12 09:44:00,1047,"Yep, Green Heron, formerly known as ""Little Green Heron"" or ""Green-backed Heron"". Great little waders that love to perch on branches overhanging the water."

493783,laszlo,2010-08-12 11:23:00,487,Yes...Green Heron.  I've seen the highest number of those this year behind my place along the Humber River. Great White Egret's are also present for the first time this year.
493795,craigdritchie,2010-08-12 12:14:00,1586,Green heron. There are a few at Bronte too.
493798,Dave Bailey,2010-08-12 12:23:00,1641,"A few years ago I was canoeing up the Humber and went up a little backwater just below Bloor Street. There was a green heron there, using a small fluffy feather to lure fish. It would drop it in the water and push it about a bit, and then pull back and patiently wait. It was so engrossed in what it was doing that I actually drifted within less than my arm's length of it. Did I have my camera with me? NO!   :wallbash:"
493810,Governator,2010-08-12 13:54:00,879,  That would be cool to see in person.  There was a viral video a couple of years ago of another bird doing the same thing.  Check this out:
493824,BillsTheBassMan,2010-08-12 15:35:00,932,"I love the picture - nice job!  Birds add a lot to fishing for me being a river guy.  I generally see a pretty sweet bird every night I'm out fishing, but have yet to see a green heron.  Thanks for sharing."
493829,Mike Pike,2010-08-12 16:13:00,1332,"Hamilton Harbour has some green herons.  I see 'em when I'm carp fishing and usually towards the evening.  A few years ago, I watched a bunch of 'em flying in formation a few off the water sorta pelican-like.  Really neat."
493988,jediangler,2010-08-13 02:03:00,1923,That is a great pick Yush. At Guelph lake I could never get close enough to get a good pic.
