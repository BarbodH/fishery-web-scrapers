493674,Drock6687,2010-08-11 22:52:00,90,So i live in cambridge and have never had any luck in the grand and had totally given up on that river for fishing.  I talked to my uncle and he told me aobut a spot about 25mins from where i live that he use to fish when he was a kid 20 years a go... I didnt really want to go cause i didnt really like the grand except for one spot where i fish for steelhead.  After about 15 mins of fishing i hooked into something that started riping my line off the real and jumping out of the water.  I was shocked when i got it to see the biggest small mouth that i have ever caught in my life.  I fished for about 2 more hours catching about another half dozen smallies averaging about 2lbs...  The only bad thing was that i lost my fishing lience in the river...Cant wait to go back tomorrow  http://i845.photobucket.com/albums/ab12/drock6687/IMG00081-20100810-1856.jpg

493768,BillsTheBassMan,2010-08-12 04:25:00,932, Gee . . . I wonder why?
493769,BillsTheBassMan,2010-08-12 04:26:00,932, That fish lives in the weeds
493770,BillsTheBassMan,2010-08-12 04:30:00,932," God I love River Bass - They peel line and they look great - Nice fish Drock!  I trust you went and bought a new license before going out tonight  AND, be sure to check your regs before fishing the Grand - there are many fish sanctuaries at varying times of the year, and many areas that are strictly single-barbless, no live bait, catch and release.  If it was up to me, I'd leave the whole river Catch & Release, save for around the bridges for the white-bucket brigade."
493812,Mike Pike,2010-08-12 14:12:00,1332,Nice job out there Drock and pretty sweet to get yourself a PB Smallie.  Nice the way it gave you such a memorable fight too with the jumps.
