I would have gone to Ministry and do it but i have to work till 5. I am just wondering if anybody knows what information i need to renew it on these machines??  Thank you  Marko"
493717,spincast,2010-08-12 00:56:00,3279,"take your ownership, insurance card and credit card. so long as you are not past the renwal date thats all you need. Fast and efficient ( so long as the person in front isn't a complete computer newbie)"
493718,Pike_Nut71,2010-08-12 00:57:00,18,"Been doing it at the machine for years, you need your current mileage, insurance policy number and a debit/credit card. Works like a charm."
493836,Flappn,2010-08-12 16:59:00,245,Agreed very easy.
493842,nuke,2010-08-12 17:19:00,60,"If required to do an e-test, better get that done first.  You can't fool the machine anymore by inputing random numbers(not that I ever tried)! Yeah man, insurance company name and policy number, approx kms, payment card.  And of course plate #."
493951,TC1OZ,2010-08-13 00:52:00,987,can you still do the machines with the e-test being required? I just assumed I would have to bring it in before next month...
494005,Marko,2010-08-13 03:14:00,854,"Thanks a lot guys. Managed to figure it out, thank god i didn't need e-test, got that done last year.....what a rip off. Wasnt that hard when you have all your info in front of you.  Thanks again"
