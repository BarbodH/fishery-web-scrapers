493764,young_one,2010-08-12 03:25:00,620,"Pickup the Core/Cumura combo today, everything is brand NEW! Only exception, the box was open  Had a few cast at the local lake, definitely the best combo I've ever had.   ""We consider the Core to be more akin to a Porsche 911 Turbo, which by no means is a cheap offering, and  while it isnâ€™t as exotic as a Ferrari it has an awesome level of performance and yet is still civilized enough to be driven (or cast) everyday."" - Tackle Tour   Mint condition   Rod still have all the plastic wrapping   Size comparison (Core100MG vs. Curado101D)   The collection so far...

493792,MCTFisher9120,2010-08-12 11:59:00,3761,"Awesome man, wow. I got the little green machine myself.

493832,bare foot wader,2010-08-12 16:27:00,1354,now just need to add a calais to that collection...
493840,lookinforwalleye,2010-08-12 17:12:00,4399,You guys gotta get out more if you like looking at fishing gear pictures!!!
493841,bassman,2010-08-12 17:19:00,384,It will look even hotter with a fish on the end of it.  Enjoy!
493845,bare foot wader,2010-08-12 17:23:00,1354," hahaha....when you sit at a desk playing with a calculator all day, looking at gear/fish pics gets ya through the day...lol"
493849,bare foot wader,2010-08-12 17:30:00,1354,"hmmm, just noticed your previous reels were lefties....how are you liking the transition to RH retrieve?....  I couldn't do it personally, only for trolling or still fishing, couldn't adjust quick enough to set the hook just as hard, imparting good action in my bait,workin a jig through snags, etc  but mostly pitchin with my left arm was horrible....never understood the pros who pitch with their right hand and then swap hands  immediately to begin the retrieve with their right hand...and then missing a fish as soon as it hits the water....never made sense to me there..."
493893,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-08-12 20:23:00,0,Very nice! I'll be upgrading alot of my defective gear very soon! Getting the Curado 201 E7 and a few more!
493912,jedimaster,2010-08-12 22:01:00,3472,"E7 and a cumara is as price as m collection gets, I have 2 E7's one on a vrod one on the cumara, a couple of dhsv's on a few Compres. The cumnara is a kick ass rod. Just don't touch a cumulus."
493921,Grimace,2010-08-12 22:45:00,2020,  I feel the exact same way.
