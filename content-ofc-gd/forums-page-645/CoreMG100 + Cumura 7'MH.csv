493404,Roy,2010-08-11 01:07:00,13728,"Yes, if that's what you want, it's a really good deal. I don't know why this is a poll though. If you just ask the question, people will tell you what they think. A yes/no poll tells you nothing."
493410,sauce,2010-08-11 01:23:00,219,When you spend that kinda money you're gonna get a sick combo. Doesn't matter if its shimano st croix loomis. Its all high end stuff. How much are you spending on this combo? Sounds to me like someone has a wad of cash burnin a hole in their pocket.
493412,young_one,2010-08-11 01:25:00,620,"The icon for a poll looks different and unique on the General Discussion page, I guess it might catch more attention. At the moment I'm already mentally committing myself to the deal 75%, just need a few more ""Yes"" to push me over the edge.  Thanks for the tip Roy!  Feel free to post any review on the combo and your opinions."
493413,solopaddler,2010-08-11 01:27:00,8605,It's a good deal. Just buy it and be done with it.
493426,sauce,2010-08-11 01:59:00,219,"Maybe I'm blind but I'm missing something. Solo and roy both say ""its a good deal"" I don't see anything about a price for this combo anywhere in youngones post."
493429,Guest LivingLegend,2010-08-11 02:14:00,0,"  He states $400......  Go for it and Im sure you wont regret it, Im looking into the cumulus rod and that alone will come $400............YIKES!"
493431,bassman,2010-08-11 02:17:00,384,"Ask your wife. If she says yes, it's too good to be true.  If your single, ask yourself."
493438,Bondar,2010-08-11 02:43:00,817,the reel is $400 new   
493439,fish-miester,2010-08-11 02:45:00,864,Its a good deal. my question is what are you going to be using the combo for?
493670,salmon,2010-08-11 22:19:00,334, As mentioned what are you using it for? I had a core 100 and I could not stand it (IMO). After half a season I sold it.  Jose
493679,steverowbotham,2010-08-11 23:16:00,1800,"thats a killer deal, if you pass on it, forward me the number"
493683,aplumma,2010-08-11 23:30:00,6896,The reel is a good reel and can be found for shy of $300.oo with careful shopping. I sent you a p.m. on the rod possibilities.   Art
493688,bare foot wader,2010-08-11 23:35:00,1354,"great deal assuming it's legit  my only question is what type of sale is this?  if it's kijiji or craigslist meet in person, don't send funds and wait for shipping...aka scam...tons of them out there, be careful if it's an internet deal...otherwise, jump on that already, one heck of a price and go catch some fish!"
