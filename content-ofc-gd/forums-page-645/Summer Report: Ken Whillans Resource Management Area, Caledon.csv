Half the times it was after work so I only got 1.5 hours in those times.  Everytime I go I get hits from at least 1 pounders and reel them in half those times. But so far I've only landed two decent fish. A 1.5 and a 2. Both times it was while I was trolling with a senko on my way back to shore.  But I do see people pull in pike too but none bigger than 2 lbs so far.  It's a good local spot to kill a few hours but not the most productive place. More for casual anglers.
