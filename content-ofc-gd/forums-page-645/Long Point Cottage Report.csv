FRIDAY  I took Friday off work to get an extra day in for the weekend and what did I do? Work of course  One of my guys called in sick and I had to get this lady's outdoor lift in that day, so after a few hours I was done and managed to get back home by noon.      After getting the kids, dogs and everything else settled and after having some dinner it was time to head out for some fishing. I had about an hour on the water and had to make good use of it. I headed over to my favorite Pike hole and threw down the electric. I recently rebuilt my transom mount Minn Kota and decided to test it out this weekend, worked great although not nearly powerful enough for the big boat and it felt weird not standing on the bow.      I went deep into the grass, threw on my mini spinnerbait and started casting. Started getting some small hits and I knew they were these little buggers. Sure did keep a smile on my face!      After getting into those little guys I finally got into a pike.    Then with only a few minutes left before I had to head in I got this little beauty! Since my buddy caught a Bowfin on Bass opener I've wanted to get one and finally got my first    Of course a few scenery shots and I was headed back in.     SATURDAY  Saturday was work day at the cottage. We took out a double window in one of the bedrooms and replaced it with a door coming out under the new pergola. Due to some findings we had more work then planned.            At about this point it was time to stop for lunch. I decided to run down to the boathouse and toss out the ol' spinnerbait. Wise choice it was!    A nice lady was kind enough to take a pic for me of this one.    Went back to the cottage and back to work.        Never did post a finish shot of the pergola    After we were done it was time to play with the kids.            I was able to sit down and relax for a bit and later on we decided to have a fire.  Caught on OFC lol        SUNDAY  Sunday was wake up early day and go fishing. I woke up at 9AM   and took my wife out. I was going to head to Deer Creek but time was tight so we hit the bay. Sam really wanted to catch a pike so I played guide for a bit. Although I can't stop myself from catching these guys.      We had a few follows and Sam finally got one on, lost it, then it hit again, jumped 3 feet into the air and spit the hook  A few minutes later she finally landed her first Pike, I even used the net for it    I took the boat out of the water and put her away in the garage. I am going away for a few weeks and thought I would let'r air out for a bit.  6 days until Restoule!!!   Dan"

You got a nice place man, plus you gave me an idea for my deck, I'm going to get rid of my 10X10 gazebo when the top rots again and put up a Pergola. How many times has someone told you your little guy is your twin."
