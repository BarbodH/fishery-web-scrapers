494303,camillj,2010-08-14 03:00:00,1988,.. yes Joe is a heckuva good lake ... havent really fished lakers there this time of year but have had alot of success there in the hardwater season ... alot .... and some BIGUNS ... 25+lbs to be had ... my guess would be deep (50 +) and slow ...  Let us know how you do !
