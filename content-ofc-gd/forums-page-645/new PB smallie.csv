I have no idea how much it weigh as i didn't have a scale but it was for sure bigger than my previous PB. We also had a pike pushing 40"" take one of our bass as we reeled it in. I started targeting bass last year, and i'm hooked. Here's a couple of smaller fish followed by the bigger one  Cheers and thanks for reading...      "
