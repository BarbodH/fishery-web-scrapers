Well its that time of year for me to get prepared,so I dont have any last minute bull to deal with! Well I spooled up my float reel with a line that everyone has been talking about,seen it in use plenty of times and worked well. Well tonight I did a little test!Its made by raven(main line)mono,8 lbs test.010 dia.Made in japan. Mind you I spooled up my reel already . I tied it off on both ends of the line and tugged on it.Line memory was lost almost instantly,on the first tug.It feels lke floro and I havent seen any imperfections in the line at all.And the stretch that occurs in a 1 ft section is what concerns me.Same as the trilene xl. Has anyone used this line,if so, any issues? I dont want to respool on the shoreline,esp a float reel! Mind you I do replace all my fishing lines on a seasonal basis!No old stuff!"
494296,justin elia,2010-08-14 02:35:00,151,"I've used Raven mainline without any issues.  Another decent line to spool with is Suffix.  I typically run 12lb mainline as I do use 10lb flouro leader in certain conditions; 8lb mainline is too light in my opinion unless your a ""light leader"" guy.  If you're seriously concerned about strech and you fish big river systems like the Credit, Saugeen, Notty etc. where long drifts are common, I would run a braided main line until it gets too cold.  You can avoid cinching by spooling in an ""x"" pattern.  Hope this helps."
494298,MJL,2010-08-14 02:39:00,2427,Iâ€™ve used Raven 8lb on the centrepin but prefer it on the spinning reel.  I find 8lb tends to stretch and dig in after battling a large fish.  I bumped up to 10lb Raven and love it.
494301,DRIFTER_016,2010-08-14 02:48:00,10439,When I lived in Ontario I spooled up with 8# Ande because I liked the way it handled but when I moved West I changed to 12# Raven as the higher test Ande lines were too stiff. If the 8# Raven is anything like there 12# I would think it would be too limp for me. As I said I run Raven 12# with 8# Ultragreen for leaders or in clear water 8# Flouro for most of my fishing.
494304,vinnimon,2010-08-14 03:07:00,2593,"10# and 12# were not in stock!So I went with the 8# line.All others havent had any issues at all!Thats why I bought it.And I use seager leader line.3 season now,and I love it! Keep in mind, its use on a float reel,not a spinning reel(hence the topic title) I will give it a go,since its on the spool.Extra spool of in hand as well.  "
494305,vinnimon,2010-08-14 03:10:00,2593,"  Thats my issue,the stretch,when I tested it!"
494306,dave524,2010-08-14 03:21:00,4508,"I'm cheap. So it depends if you sidecast or wallis/pull cast. Sidecast works better with limper lines like Trilene XL , I pull cast and use the stiffer 10 lb XT Trilene, both available almost everywhere and at a bargain price."
494307,Chromeblood,2010-08-14 03:25:00,14,Suffix never gave me no problems last fall.
