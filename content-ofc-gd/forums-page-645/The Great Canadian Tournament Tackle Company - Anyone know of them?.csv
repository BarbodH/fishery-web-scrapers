I find a tackle stand within five minutes of being there (she gives me the ""only you could find tackle at a food market"" look).  They are called the ""Great Canadian Tournament Tackle Company"" and the gentleman says they are based out of Hamilton.  I ask him if the goods are made in Canada and he says ""nothing is made in North America anymore.""  A bad first impression, but we continue talking, and he is a really nice guy.  His lures are priced to sell at $2.50 a pop and he features 4/5 different topwater frogs, some triple jointed swim baits, single jointed crankbaits, and some good looking jerkbaits.  I buy the 4 for $10 and have yet to fish the lures.  I am wondering if anyone knows anything about these guys or if anyone has fished their lures?  They seem solid and it may be a way that some of you OFC'ers can put some decent lures in your collection for cheap.  Ryan"
493850,Roy,2010-08-12 17:33:00,13728,The lures are all $4.99 on their website. They put the Canadian flag on everything. I imagine it's an import company. These guys seem to be the owners with two Southern Ontario area codes. Ralph Tessaro: (289) 237-5338 Marc Larocque: (905) 741 5338
493852,cwpowell,2010-08-12 17:47:00,265,I have a few of these guys in my box. Some cool lures.  Great action on some of them. Although I've never caught anything on them. I got them from Bills Bait and Tackle on Upper James in Hamilton.
493854,BillsTheBassMan,2010-08-12 18:03:00,932," Hmmmmm, lures were $2.50 at the St. Jacobs Market.  The waders were $25.  It was a little disheartening seeing the Canadian flag all over imported goods, but the guys were nice and they seemed to know what they were talking about."
493928,vinnimon,2010-08-12 23:30:00,2593,  I hesitated on them and bulked up on the cotten cordels at the same price!
493929,asdve23rveavwa,2010-08-12 23:33:00,2690,"Smart move, Vince.  Better quality lures, especially at that price."
493965,johndox,2010-08-13 01:24:00,54,I ran into him at his house in Caledonia at their annual yard sale last year and bought a rubber net off of him for a fair price and he had lures 4 for 10 bucks and I bought 4 . He was also selling waders and some other fishing stuff. Seemed like a nice guy and had a beautiful Ranger boat in his garage.
493975,BillsTheBassMan,2010-08-13 01:48:00,932, Have you fished or caught anything on the lures?
494146,TC1OZ,2010-08-13 16:44:00,987,I just skip the middle man and order the 500 lot from china off ebay and get the lures for less than 50 cents a pop.
