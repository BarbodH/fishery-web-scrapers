494148,Roy,2010-08-13 16:50:00,13728,"I'd hold out till they give you the boat too.  Wherever you go, have a great time."
494149,SudburyAngler,2010-08-13 16:52:00,154,Tight lines where ever you go
494151,ketchenany,2010-08-13 17:02:00,3229,"Tobermory area, amazing scenery and the fishing isn't bad either!"
494161,jediangler,2010-08-13 17:22:00,1923,"I'd go to Emily Provicial park on Pigeon lake and then rent a boat from Triple ""T"" Cedars resort nearby."
494230,Lunatic,2010-08-13 22:07:00,536,i'd go with this. i camped there last year had fun. im thinking about doing it again if i can this year
494233,spincast,2010-08-13 22:24:00,3279,"dont know for sure, but I would imagine someone in the Long Point area rents boats or canoes? Between deer creek, big creek and the inner bay for fishing and the beach for fun, what more could you ask for?"
494239,bow slayer,2010-08-13 23:27:00,1074," Long point is great if you don't mind crowds and idiot boaters. If your looking for a more relaxing vacation with some privacy and a smaller crowd you will have to drive a few hours north or at least northeast. Sharbot lake,Silver lake and the area north of Kingston are about 3.5 hours for you,try maybe Mikisew,Arrowhead,or Grundy to the north.Six mile is okay has good fishing,boat rentals but is very popular and has alot of traffic."
494254,archer379,2010-08-14 00:32:00,277,another vote for emily i have our new camper there for the weekend to test it all out before we take it to far emily is only 20 min away great fishing.
