493882,Hooked,2010-08-12 19:55:00,891,I have a battery question.  I will be mounting a transom mount trolling motor onto a 14' aluminum boat and will be connecting to a 12V battery.  Are there any problems that I may encounter if I don't have a battery case for it?  Is it required or can I leave it exposed?  Just wondering.  Any help appreciated.
