372397,Metal Inc,2009-08-13 17:46:00,3,I often like to fish after a hard days work with my girlfriend and am looking for some good spots to fish in Brampton. I've heard Professors Lake and Heart Lake isn't to bad. I've tried Professors Lake a few times but only caught 1 large mouth there using a spinner and as for Heart Lake I hear you can only go during the day and you have to pay as well. Any info would be greatly appreciated.

Here's what I've caught this summer.  Mind you, the fishing is pretty slow here but the more I go the better chance I have of hooking into decent fish.           "
