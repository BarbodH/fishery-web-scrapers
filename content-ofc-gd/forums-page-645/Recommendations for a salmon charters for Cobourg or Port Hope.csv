I have been salmon charter fishing many times but i have always travelled to the st.catherines area, but since I live in the kawartha lakes and we are going to make it a family affair this year, and there will be a couple littler ones with us and st.catherines could be a hell of a drive. We would like to go with someone who obviously can put some fish in the boat, and if you have any idea on how much it would cost or cost you it would be fantastic to know. Thanks everyone, i appreciate any advice or knowledge you would be willing to share!"

494206,fishnsled,2010-08-13 20:13:00,3520,I guess it depends on the size of your group.  Lloyd can take up to 4 I believe and you will not be disappointed.  If the group is larger call Lloyd anyways and he'll get something sorted out for you I'm sure.
