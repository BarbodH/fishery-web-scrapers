492046,troutologist,2010-08-06 20:13:00,951,If downtown Sault Ste Marie has taught me anything. Spawning chinooks will only hit buzzbombs.  I've never seen fidelity to a single lure like the salmon run faithful there.  Up a certain tributary of the st marys was the 1st place I've seen a shotgun used to angle.  Makes me question Darwin sometimes...

492320,BillM,2010-08-07 21:16:00,17367,"Big, nasty, smelly skein will work perfect...   From what I've been told by a few guys that have had very good success doing this, is to not run the bait to deep.  They've told me they've caught fish 1ft below the float out in the harbours...  Something to think about."
493455,fishinguypat,2010-08-11 04:46:00,547,how big should the chunks be cut?
493460,solopaddler,2010-08-11 09:45:00,8605,Young William has learned his lessons well.  Just to rehash a few points that have already been made:  1.The only place I enjoy fishing for them is piers and estuaries. Once they've run upstream you can have them.  2.Throwing lures like glow spoons and rattle baits are very effective especially so at night.  3.Keep your retrieve slow you'll get more hookups.  4.My favourite technique is drifting giant gobs of skein under a float.  5.Large is better. Anywhere from a Toonie sized to a chunk the size of a good sized plum.  6.For whatever reason the salmon love hot pink skein even in crystal clear water.  7.As Bill already mentioned it pays to run an extremely short lead under your float when angling off a pier. Especially if they're actively porpoising and rolling.  8.Bring a large net with a long handle to net your catch off the high pier walls. It never ceases to amaze me how many newbs come down unprepared.
493509,Harrison,2010-08-11 13:17:00,2202,"Nothing like a fresh chinny smacking a float with a one foot lead off the peir(steelies close 2nd, lol).  My fav is 3 to 4 inch glow in the dark tubes at night under the float when the arms are too tired of chucking spoons and fighting fish."
493513,MJL,2010-08-11 13:27:00,2427, Who said what now about glow tubes?...Nothing to see here folks  They're absolutely deadly underneath a float at night.  The last couple years I've been experimenting with glow marabou jigs beneath a float for my nighttime steelie hunts with some extremely deadly consequences (for steelies and chinnies that is)
493525,Harrison,2010-08-11 13:42:00,2202," I have an issue with sharing stuff I figure out sometimes  , but hey, hopefully some good folks might get into some fish if they try it.  But ya didn't have to elaborate, your just as guilty MJL..."

493636,MJL,2010-08-11 20:14:00,2427," I've got bad news  From OFC News Weekly ""Top economists suggest that the global market demand for Ping A T lures is on a continuously sharp decline.  The lure company is in its final stage of its product life cycle and has gone from being a cash cow to a dog, according to the Boston Consulting Group (BCG).  The global market price suggested by experts reveals that these lures should be sold at a fair market value price of $2.50 each.  The price is expected to drop another 2 cents tomorrow with news that these lures must be retrieved incredibly slow or they will flip over and fail to work - A perceived product design flaw according to some anglers.  A recent interview with fishing mogul, MJL suggests that he is willing to purchase the entire stock at 10% higher than the suggested fair market value of $2.50.  By doing so, he is in effect allowing Spiel Corp to progress his inventory management practices to something similar to that of Toyota’s just-in-time (JIT) management system.  Spiel’s bottom line can only improve with such a transaction.""  Sorry Chris, $35.00 won’t cut it in such a competitive market place without the demand"

490978,ctranter,2010-08-03 21:00:00,543,"So last year while walking my dog along the Humber I came across a few fisherman waist deep in waders and stopped to chat with them a bit.  I asked them how they were catching Salmon.  The reply was ""Salmon don't feed when they enter rivers, instead the only way to catch them is to ""accidentally"" hook them.  Couple minutes later I watched the same guy set the hook into a dorsal fin, and haul the beast into a net.  I refuse to believe the only way to catch salmon is to snag them...  So this year I would love to experience the salmon run, but I want to do it legitimately.  I know pretty much any Lake O tributary supports the salmon migration but I dont know what type of equipment to use.  Rod???   -    I have a light St. Croix 11.5'er that I use for Steelehead, is this too light?  Will a 20 lb salmon snap this if    it      runs downstream?  Line????  -    I assume braid is ideal because its strength, yet the guys I talked to said they used 12lb mono.... really?  Tackle???    -   The guys I watched on the humber used Rapala's and huge spoons, I can only assume because they made snagging easier.  If its true that salmon don't feed on their migration, then what else catches them legit?  Technique???  -   I did pretty well last season float fishing for steele, is this an effective technique for Salmon as well?  The guys I watched were fishing very shallow... and using cast and retrieve technique.  Thanks for the guidance!"
490999,glen,2010-08-03 21:29:00,2641,That rod is too light.  Go with a heavy spinning 8'er. Line go with 10lb -12lb mono. Yes they will bite. You can catch them float fishing.
491012,craigdritchie,2010-08-03 21:53:00,1586,"Salmon fishing in rivers is a good news/bad news deal. The good news is they can be a lot of fun to catch. The bad news is that nothing attracts hordes of inbred idiots like a salmon run. So they quickly become just about impossible to catch legitimately as a result of all the morons wading in up to their chins and snagging the bejeezus out of them. Actually, snagging is the least of it - it's fairly common to see jerks chasing them up and down the rapids with landing nets, night and day. Popular rivers like the Credit, Humber and Bronte can be absolute war zones on warm autumn weekends, so little wonder the fish get just a wee bit spooky.  If you can find undisturbed fish (and it's a big if) then they can be caught legitimately on regular steelhead tackle. Truth is, in most rivers they can't really go too far, so if you're patient, they're fairly easy to land on a medium to heavy steelhead rod and mono from maybe 6 to 10 pound test. Fluorocarbon is even better. Forget braid - it looks like rope in the water, and this is one kind of fishing where you want to be as subtle and low-visibility as you can. Your St. Croix should be fine providing you don't try to horse the fish. Regular float fishing techniques with roe or small dark-coloured flies will work just fine on fresh salmon.  In larger, deeper rivers, you're probably better off to use a heavier spinning outfit and cast small crankbaits like Flatfish, Kwikfish, Hot Shots etc. Cast across the pool and slowly retrieve so it swings across in the current. You might want to add a split shot or two, maybe a foot in front of the lure, to help get it down in the current. For what it's worth, this works really well in the frogwater down by the lake, and in harbour areas too. In fact it's probably the most reliable way to catch salmon legitimately from land. I've completely given up stream fishing for them in favour of this approach.  The best harbour and stream fishing is for freshly-arrived fish. They deteriorate quickly in shallow creeks like Bronte or the Humber, especially if the weather is a bit warm. Once they reach spawning condition, it's basically game over - they're focused on having fun with other salmon, so leave them be. A good rule of thumb is, if you can see the fish, then they can see you too. Move on and try somewhere else.  Chinook usually show up in the lower end of bigger rivers by the end of August, usually following a good cold rain. Coho are normally a bit later, normally October or November. Coho seem to respond to lures more consistently than chinook, but that's just my opinion.  Best advice I can offer is to get as far away from other people as possible. Some of these guys who show up for the salmon run are real Neanderthals. Honestly ... it's a wonder some of them can even walk upright."
491014,glen,2010-08-03 21:58:00,2641,
491015,alexcba,2010-08-03 21:59:00,634,"i use a 9 foot noodle rod with a straight 6lb mono line and a spinning reel. you can use bigger rod, you'll just have to play the fish more.  salmon will hit in rivers, i have had some foul hooks i normally just snap my line the moment i realize this as fighting a snagged salmon is a fight i dont want but the majority are right in the yap. get your self set up with the equipment and you and i can meet up at old mill and fish together. i'll show you my brown/rainbow holes too. maybe if you enjoy it enough you can join in on our north of 89 trips."
491025,DRIFTER_016,2010-08-03 22:15:00,10439,"  Some good advice here. To add, I always had good luck using Michigan Wigglers (flies) in chartreuse or orange. Float fishing is IMHO the best way to legally hook fish, especially in pressured waters.  I found early on in my salmon fishing exploits that I foul hooked many more fish when bottom bouncing than I did once I went to the float.  Try and get away from the rubes and your chances for fair hookups increase dramatically."
491042,laszlo,2010-08-03 23:39:00,487,I've never punched someone in the face in my adult life but last year I seriously considered it many times during the salmon run.  One day walking my dog along the Humber I saw 2 guys wading in the water in steel toe boots wearing work jeans casting into the dam with 5 foot light action rods snagging fish. Cave men came to mind.
491047,bare foot wader,2010-08-03 23:51:00,1354,some good info mentioned above  IMO most legitimate method is float fishing  bottom bouncing(esp sight fishing) generally = flossing the salmon
491048,Dozer,2010-08-03 23:51:00,896,"50 lb. braid, 3 oz. bell sinker and the biggest treble hook you can find!  ...and did someone just say 6 pound test?!?!?  I stay away from the creeks during the salmon run."
491058,dave524,2010-08-04 00:04:00,4508,"Done the best with a float rod, larger than normal float and leader, egg loop on a stout hook and a big gob of fresh skein."
491075,12footspringbok,2010-08-04 00:41:00,459,"First off in MY OPINION salmon are just as easily ""flossed"" in deep pools with float gear as they are in shallow pools bottom bouncing.  Now back to the original topic.  For rods i've used a few different styles and lengths but i prefer a 8-9ft medium action spinning rod. I use this because it is alot easier to move around with and not get tangled up in trees etc but still gives good control when figting a fish.  For line i like 12-14 pound test depends where you are fishing. These past few years i've opted for the 14 due to the heavy woodwork i usually fish around.  For lures some of my favourites would be jointed rapalas, spinners, diving crankbaits, and flatfish. I find different years the fish have different preferences, last year my go to bait was a rapala taildancer in pink/blue.  For technique i like casting in retreiving in pools directly downstream for some sort of obstruction like fallen logs or perhaps in a deep pool right behind a sandbar that comes up shallow. As already mentioned the majority of the time if you can see the fish the fish can see you and won't bite...Unless they are undisturbed and you are real sneaky   I think its true that the fish don't feed when in the rivers the bites are just reaction from the fish becoming territorial and being pissed that your invading their space. I've watched salmon come up from the depths of a pool to smash my lure with only 3 feet of line left from the tip of my rod and its quite a wakeup at 6 am   Theres no better feeling than feeling a salmon smash your bait on the retreive.  GOOD LUCK!  Heres a couple pics of some legit caught fish from last fall... It can be done.    "
491080,Musky or Specks,2010-08-04 00:49:00,2710,Caught this one legitimately on a buchertail    So they do hit in rivers
491082,BillM,2010-08-04 00:54:00,17367,"Sure they hit in rivers, about 5% of the time, lol..  If you want some hard fighting chinnies, get out on the piers while they are staging, they'll be fresh and you'll experience exactly what a 25lb chinook can do..  Don't wait for it to be half dead swimming upstream."
491088,salmon,2010-08-04 01:13:00,334," X2 What BillM said. They are much more fun at the piers. Gave up the rivers many a moons ago. The only time I will get into the river @ October, November. When the circus leaves town."
491259,torco,2010-08-04 14:55:00,656,I agree with most about the piers and mouths of rivers. They are alot of fun when they are fresh and the rivers become a circus but to each his own. You can have fun catching salmon in the river and it can be done legally and many would argue ethically.  I am sure between now and October we will read countless debates and horror stories involving this annual event.
491266,asdve23rveavwa,2010-08-04 15:07:00,2690," I second Bill's statement.  Hit the piers in the evening/dark for the best action.  At least some of the fish are still worth catching.  Once they are in the river, unless you are fishing big water, they really aren't worth pursuing."
491306,bucktail,2010-08-04 18:10:00,1857,"Nothings better then a big old marshmallow, giant treble and 50 pound test!

491774,ctranter,2010-08-06 00:12:00,543,"  Well played, sir"
491949,mk2vr6,2010-08-06 15:07:00,14,definitely chucking spoons off the piers during the staging and early runs is where it's at.  Once they are up in the rivers they are mostly a nuisance when you are trying to fish for browns and fresh steelies.
492039,CLofchik,2010-08-06 19:56:00,854,"1)  The last time I drifted the Humber & Credit rivers for Kings I saw a guy running through the riffles chasing salmon with a sword.  A flippin' SWORD! 2)  Any GTA river will have hordes of goobers exactly 22 minutes after the first pod of Kings show up (I've timed it several times)   What he said, ofcourse there's times when the fish are seriously running the rivers or inbetween pods of running fish when the piers fall silent.  The lower estuaries of rivers are probably the most reliable places to fish, and as a bonus flossing them is significantly harder when they have some depth to play with so the hordes of goobers generally leave the stretch of river between the pier and first few rapids alone.  Chucking wobbling or rattling lures in the deep holes pick up plenty of fish, but drifting a hunk of skein under a float just off bottom can tempt the most tight lipped of salmon most of the time.  Plus the mud sharks in the estuaries still have some water to play with and put up a better fight than shallow pools.    Learn how to tie an egg loop and pick up some skein.  Most trollers will gladly give up some skein if you ask, so boat ramps with a fish cleaning station are a good place to score some free eggs."
