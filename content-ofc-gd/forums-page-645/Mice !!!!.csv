492396,walleyejack,2010-08-08 02:18:00,358,"Anyone have an idea how to keep mice from chewing my boat cover up? 2yrs ago they built a nice nest up front where my trolling battery goes,last year they returned and chewed a hole in the cover and chewed the crap out of one of the seats. Mothballs any good ? I park it at a farm out back in winter. Any ideas would be appreciated"
492402,Pigeontroller,2010-08-08 02:25:00,2793,Find somewhere mice-free to park it?
492426,zeeter,2010-08-08 03:44:00,92,I store my boat outside as well.  I wrap it up tight and put small mesh bags with moth balls throughout the boat.  I use a lot of them.  I also put a lot of bounce sheets in the boat as well - mice apparently hate the smell.  Done this for two years and no mice !
492450,canuckjack,2010-08-08 11:30:00,121,"+1 to Zeeter's reply, bounce sheets and/or mothballs should do the trick."
492456,Bill Shearer,2010-08-08 11:59:00,456,"I used to store my boat in a barn. There were tons of mice! Lots of mothballs, and little boxes of warfarin as well. If the little beggars did go in, they'd find a tasty snack as well. Never found a dead one, so I suspect the mothballs did the trick."
492457,4thgen,2010-08-08 12:09:00,157,Mothballs didn't work for me last winter when I used them with poison sticks to try to keep a car mouse-free. I'll be following this thread -- hopefully I won't be pulling the whole vent/heating system out again next spring...
492466,lew,2010-08-08 13:00:00,12766,"I stored my last boat inside a barn for 9 winters and a bowl of mothballs on the floor kept it completely critter free.  I know another fella that stored his covered boat outside a couple years back and the interior was completely destroyed by racoons.....carpets, seats, upholstery and wooden floor."
492469,walleyejack,2010-08-08 13:14:00,358,"Thanks folks, just bought a new cover so don t want to destroy it this year, give me at least a couple yrs. I will try the mothballs and bounce, and a little mouse treat for them if they get hungry.  Thanks Al"

492477,lew,2010-08-08 13:32:00,12766, But how do you train the fox to pee on the cotton ball ??
492481,Spiel,2010-08-08 13:46:00,9065,  I was wondering the same thing.

492493,Dondorfish,2010-08-08 14:30:00,1000,Wow - been storing my boat outside for the last 10 years without doing anything but covering it. Guess I have just been lucky!  Going to try some of these ideas just in case. Thanks guys!  Tracker ( Don )
492520,Fisherman,2010-08-08 15:15:00,7201," Oh Lew..you guys are sooo helpless at times   I called up this guy from over in the woodline, give him a mouse and he just about pee'd all over himself. http://www.urbannaturestore.ca/shop/pc/viewPrd.asp?idproduct=771&idcategory=7"
492647,bigugli,2010-08-08 21:21:00,6138,I occassionaly left a dish of kitty chow in the boat shed. Lots of cats = no mice.
492651,crappieperchhunter,2010-08-08 21:37:00,2582,"  I used Fox Pee in my garden for years to keep coons & squirrels out of my sweet corn. I read about it in a gardening magazine once and gave it a try. Works better then anything else I tried to keep coons and squirrels out of my corn.  I imagine it would have the same effect on mice.  Occasionally after several ""pops"" I would just go and whizz it the corn patch myself, but that's a whole other topic of conversation"

493025,Big Cliff,2010-08-09 20:27:00,6899,"Make sure tou have  no ropes or anythng running to ground that they can climb, that will usually keep them from getting in."
493867,fishermccann,2010-08-12 19:00:00,655,"I use oil of peppermint, in the boat, cottage, and tent trailer. Works great have had no mice for years."
493878,Fishnwire,2010-08-12 19:34:00,983,  I'm not sure any such place exists.
493886,BillsTheBassMan,2010-08-12 20:09:00,932,Catch 'Em & Bait 'Em   There are some old timers that used to drift mice down brown-holding waters on cedar planks and then jerk them off in fish-holding waters.
493898,aplumma,2010-08-12 20:36:00,6896,"Moths have Balls ???   :dunno:    It seems the ones down South don't have them but I guess they could ...never really checked.  A bag of charcoal with a few holes in the top will get rid of odor and humidity. The bounce sheets works here just make sure you put them inside of the boxes, under the motor cowel and in the main area so they cant find a scent free place to set up house.   Art"
493973,bow slayer,2010-08-13 01:44:00,1074,"I have been using moth balls and bounce sheets with great results also,another good option is original irish spring soap cut up on a small plate."
