492939,Roy,2010-08-09 17:11:00,13728,Yes.....there will be a pinned topic in there shortly explaining how it works.
492940,TC1OZ,2010-08-09 17:13:00,987,"I would of posted there, but its read only  Cool idea Roy, its a shame you have to do that, but its needed!"
492941,markiemark70,2010-08-09 17:13:00,158,Great something else to push the content down further so I have to waste valuable scrolling energy to read content!!
492966,TJQ,2010-08-09 18:24:00,7806,"The idea is that if a charter service or lodge wants really good exposure they can post in there. Its a non discussion forum, so we have a place for that stuff now. that way people can see whats out there without it being spammy. Of course, the exposure will be awesome, so were gonna charge yearly for it.  So if any of the guides on here want to give it a whirl, PM me or Roy for more info!"
492968,TJQ,2010-08-09 18:26:00,7806,"It also doesn't change the fact that if a guest of a lodge or guide wants to post a report thats still fair game in the open forum. This is just an opportunity for business to post. Were gonna give it a shot, weve been talking about this for a long time.. lol"
492970,TJQ,2010-08-09 18:32:00,7806,and yes... iedited out everyones reposes so that the post is correct for that forum.

493735,markiemark70,2010-08-12 01:52:00,158,"Well I dont know how great it is from a business perspective: they have created a lesser product, AND started charging for it. It would make sense to say, we are going to create this subforum, and you can post your ""advertorials"" in there for free, OR you can pay X per year for the priviledge of posting in the main forum where all the traffic is.  Only way it makes sense is if they use it as a throw in for people that buy banners on the site. Otherwise it is a waste of money. Let's be honest, noone is going to make the 2 extra clicks to be advertised to.  That's my $0.02"
493752,bigfish1965,2010-08-12 02:34:00,3382,"We had to do something about the lodges and guides posting 'reports'..cause lets face it, it was spammy. So this leads our sponsors who pay for banners asking why do they pay for that when a once a month 'report' gives them the same exposure? This sites number one visitor and number one user of bandwidth is...are you ready.....Google Bots. They are updating this site continuously...almost live. We tested this by inventing a word awhile ago and seeing how long it took to show up on Google. Less than an hour. We know that people end up here Googling for stuff for sale. Lots of them. We also know what our average page views per user is. So think of the Guide and Lodge showcase as more of a super-efficient Blog. If the guides format the post properly, it will drive it even higher in the ratings. Google is addicted to sites like this because the content in continuously changing. If a guide or lodge gets ONE booking out of it, it pays for itself many times over since most people tend to use the same guide or lodge more than once. Exposure is far more relevant these days than click-throughs."
