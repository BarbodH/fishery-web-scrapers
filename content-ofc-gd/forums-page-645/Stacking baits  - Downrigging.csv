I want to run 2 lines or even 3 if possible off on downrigger, what are your suggestions on how to do this, I have seen a few differnt ways but looking for the best.  I will problably have the cannonball at 100ft or so and wanted to run a bait at around 60ft.    Thanks"

494128,The Birdfish,2010-08-13 15:42:00,73,"I want to run a second rod on the cable  Fishing God in the picture it has 2 releases, is that to run 2 lines and attach the clip to the cable??"
494134,Spiel,2010-08-13 15:59:00,9065," Shucks, nobody actually ever called me a ""Fishing God"", but I'm good with it.  It's a stacking release for a second rod, the snap closure goes on the rigger cable, with one clip on the cable to keep it at the desired depth and the clip on the fishing line. Can be set anywhere on the rigger cable.    Here's another style I use that can work anywhere on the rigger cable.  Scotty stacker release  "
