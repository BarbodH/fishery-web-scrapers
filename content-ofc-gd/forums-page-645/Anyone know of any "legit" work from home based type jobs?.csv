493562,Harrison,2010-08-11 15:49:00,2202,"Hey all, sorry for the non fishing post.  My misses has been a stay at home Mom for the last few years raising our toddlers.  She left the financial biz sector in an administrative position to do this.  With the kiddies getting older(plus moola tighter) and a little more time on her hands she is looking for a ""legit"" work from home job.  Does anyone know of any ""type' of jobs or place we can research.  Everything advertised seems fishy.  Sorry again about the NF post, but could use some guidance if anyone is familiar with this.  Thanks in advance, Phil  PS. we tried the daycare route, let's just say, you meet some interesting folks."

493570,Headhunter,2010-08-11 15:57:00,5703,"Phil, If she has strong office admin skills, including typing skills, there are many law offices that will take people on a part time basis to help them stay organized and to do typing for them. I would connect, using your local yellow pages and let them know that she is available for this kind of work. Helps to keep her local if you contact lawyers in your town or region. Just my first thought on the matter... maybe more to come!!! HH"
493573,Harrison,2010-08-11 16:21:00,2202," Yea, I think schooling is out as of now till maybe the kiddies both get into school.  She is a fitness nut, at the gym 5 days a week doing the classes.  She looked into teaching and training, but it's the schooling/monies she needs that is holding her back for now.    Thanks for the advice sir. I'll forward this to her."
493581,cynmar,2010-08-11 16:45:00,169,"Couple things I might think of, bookkeeping as you said she was in the financial sector may be available or assistance for a local accountant. If she was in admin in the financial sector, then she should be comfortable with filing, financials, maybe government requirements, there fore charge to provide assistance for local businesses and working from home. Possibly hook up with a publishing company to do proof reading and corrections from computer at home. Just a couple of ideas I had off the top of my head."

493603,Harrison,2010-08-11 17:28:00,2202," Thanks Bill, I will forward this to her as well. She's beginning to feel helpless, hopefully these resposes will boost her up.  Thanks for taking the time to post."
493618,youngvedder,2010-08-11 18:55:00,72," lots of good opportunities out there...in my office we have people doing the following remotely..  * CRS agent * project management * Documentation specialists * Information security officer * Relationship management * Business development support agents * Quality reviewer/entitlement reviews.   hope that helps a bit!  cheers,  Yv"
493620,charlesn,2010-08-11 19:03:00,551,"Hey Phill, depending on how many hours of availability she plans to have and flexibility, I recommend trying something like freelancer.com or odesk.com  It's a place where employers go to find part-time skilled workers and vice versa.  As an employer you put in the type of worker you are seeking and as a contractor, I'd assume you plug in the types of things you're willing to do and you get notices maybe when things come up.  I've only been on the employer side of things.  The rates are highly variable and I have never picked the cheapest option.  There are always very cheap options off shore - however I know that in some things - English communication is very important and thus North Americans are perceived as a better choice.  The other good thing about it is that the payment for the job is put into escrow with the site - so the site will hold the funds until the job is complete then release to the worker.  The contractor won't start a job without the funds being uploaded so you never waste your time working for someone over the internet and then have them just run off on you after you do the work and the employer doesn't pay someone to do work and then have the person just run off in to the ether.  I don't know if it costs anything to be a contractor on there.  Good luck to her.  Charles"

Many companies hire sales positions which work from home, however it may be a ""eat what you kill"" format, meaning it's commissioned based. I'd look into selling promotional items (shirts, pens, mugs ect...) to businesses through cold calling or networking. I've known of a few people that have done this and made some good cash once you build up your client base (5-10 years) I'm talking a 100k+ a year, plus you can deduct your car, fuel, entertainment, computer ect.. as an additional benefit.  The promotional business is a 3.2 billion dollar a year industry in Canada alone, lots of money to be made!  As with any sales job, it's how much time you put in it, will net re$ult$.  Good luck"
