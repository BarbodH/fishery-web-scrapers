493631,Spiel,2010-08-11 19:44:00,9065,"   Ummmmm,  not! If you set the hook, it's yours. Just saying."
493634,Guest gbfisher,2010-08-11 19:49:00,0,  That would mean that your buddy is now fishing with more than one rod. Specially if yer being watched. Funny how each knows when they are breaking the law but try and figure out ways to pull the wool over a co's eye's. Believe me when I say they have seen it all and know how to deal with each situation and fine you accordingly.  Now put the rods in holders and troll........
493635,fish_finder,2010-08-11 19:57:00,370, Exactly.  I spend alot of time ice fishing as well.  I am very adamant about keeping my catch separate from others that I am with.  Why on earth would want to risk your fishing license and on top of that everything you use to enjoy the sport?
493638,Fang,2010-08-11 20:25:00,1330,I've had this explained to me very clearly on Simcoe by a CO who was checking licenses. He had just written up a few guys that were fishing close by and I asked him what went on as the guy getting the ticket was very loud in his displeasure. Seems the CO sat and watched 1 angler land a number of whities in a short span of time and this angler kept his 2 and them kept keeping them but placing the landed fish at his buddies whole. NOT ALLOWED!!  One angler can catch and keep only the number of fish on the personal daily limit. They can not catch and keep more than the limit even if his buddy doesn't have his count. CO's don't care who owns what lines or who was watching which tip up. It's the physical act of landing the fish that indicates whos fish it is.  The CO gave us a simple solution . If you have you're count put the fish back down the whole. If a buddy needs a fish let him/her land it.
493644,dave524,2010-08-11 20:49:00,4508,"In my opinion, being a hunter where party hunting is legal and being of an age where party fishing was socially , traditionally, morally and legally acceptable at one time, this change in the regulations or enforcement of, not really sure if it was really technically legal but was overlooked as long as the headcount in the boat covered the fish on the stringer. It is one big mess!"
493645,brifishrgy,2010-08-11 20:54:00,559, then how do charters get away with it??
493652,Spiel,2010-08-11 21:06:00,9065,  Lack of MNR officers and enforcement.  
493754,fish_finder,2010-08-12 02:43:00,370," Theres a big difference between party hunting and party fishing though.  Tags are used to identify kills in hunting, and obviously the seasons are much shorter.  Fishing is easy to take advantage of as far as limits go, which if party fishing were allowed these days, could easily decimate populations of fish on a body of water.  Why are people so concerned about being able to take all they can out of the water anyways?  It sure as hell aint what gets me out fishing!"
493757,John Bacon,2010-08-12 03:00:00,3277," Yes, that is correct."

493833,capt bruce,2010-08-12 16:37:00,820," Who says we do ??? Along time ago in a land far far away , we used to set up the lines (I run 6 to 8 lines depending on size of party ) and than the boys would draw cards to see who goes first second etc. , I have now been told NO CAN DO as that would be one guy fishing with 8 lines , so now eatch guy gets 2 rods and that is that , now we tag eatch fish caught with a coloured tag , blue for you red for him etc. for all  kept fish . No more 8 guys plus me and deck hand means 10 limits in box , things change , do I think its right , maybe what do I know Im a fisherman not a liar ,I mean lawyer, but I trust that the guys makeing these silly (did I say silly , I ment smart , well thought out ,sorry for my spelling mistake) rules know what they are doing and even if I did not I still must follow them . just my take on things , but please do not think charters get away with things I get stopped as much if not more and checked out as anyone out on the lake ."
493873,fishermccann,2010-08-12 19:23:00,655,"It's the LAW, follow it or don't fish!"
493916,Kilka,2010-08-12 22:22:00,17," For what it's worth, I never said I party fish on Joe, but yes we do put the fish in one pile.  I'm sure everyone can also identify who caught which fish. And no, this isn't so we can get the max limit, since we C&R most of the fish anyways, and rarely actually keep the 6-8 fish total for the 3-4 of us (even though most people catch more than 2 fish). Fish go in one pile since we often rotate holes/rod/tip-ups. I was just pointing out that the CO always seems fine with this.  The other point I was making is that it is a stupid law because it is non enforceable. Even if the way it is being ""enforced"" at the moment counts, it's still pointless.  You are with a buddy on Simcoe, caught two whitefish and your buddy caught one. The CO is fine with him keeping the fish as long as he lands it, so assuming you hand him your rod when you have a fish on, what good is this law doing if four rods are still being used?"
493931,curlrap,2010-08-12 23:38:00,58,"We have 2 co's in west nipissing. You really think they give a crap who caught the fish. I don't think so, as long as you don't exceed the total possesion limit and the fish are not in the slot. Like others have said, there's no way this rule can be enforced. The natives have to be within a certain weight limit at the end of their season. Do you really think they give a crap about a weignt limit, NO. Do you think a weight limit can be enforced for the natives, NO. I am just tring to say that some peaple are making too much of a big deal about this topic."
494016,TC1OZ,2010-08-13 04:10:00,987,I crazy party and fish every time I go out!  oh wait.. thats not what you guys are going on about eh?
493374,Fisherman,2010-08-10 23:56:00,7201,"Sinclairs belief: Is that specifically called out in the regulations? I always was (and still am) of the impression that you can fill up your boat's stringer/live well until the number of fish reaches the combined limit of the licenses on board. Since the wording of the law says ""possession"" and not ""catching"" (with the exception of some Aurora Trout reg's I believe)  Same deal for ice fishing - 5 guys tending to 10 tip-ups. We always combine our limits. Who is to say who a fish belongs to?  The guy who put the bait on? The guy who shouted flag up? The guy who owns the tip-up?  This is called party fishing and not allowed, if you wish to use the word ""possession"" then the owner or Captain of the boat is in possession of the boat and contents and then he is way over the limit. Therefore it's wise to know who caught what and never mind filling your buddies limit."
493380,Muskieman,2010-08-11 00:07:00,2472,Pokin' at the bees nest ?   Ethically ... Once the angler has caught his/her limit the rod should be put away.  But......... after a few wobbly pops who cares?????????  Most guides I know of on Nip have a cooler or livewell full of fish at the end of the day and divi'em up once the get to the dock.  Our local C/O's never bother the guides for this... In fact one of our local C/O's is a guide himself.  As for Ice fishing???????  makes no sense to me ... I'm not about to stand beside a line that's going down and wait for my buddy to come runnin' out of the shack to miss it.... I'll set the hook and bring it and throw it in the pile.  Besides probably too much paper-work for the C/O's to enforce.  Fishin's always a party!   RFS 
493385,richyb,2010-08-11 00:14:00,774,They were nailing people all over simcoe lastyear for party fishing. Some of the guys I know would have their limit but continue to fish and when they hooked one they would pass the line over to someone who needed a fish .. Seemed to keep the CO's happy.  Lots of fish likely die from someone having their limit and releasing a dozen more while they are waiting for their fishing partner to catch their limit... If you and your partner are going to go home with you limit anyways would it be better for 4 fish to be caught or 20 ( 18 by one guy but 16 released) ?
493389,Fisherman,2010-08-11 00:19:00,7201,"Common violations that can be avoided direct from the MNR site:  Possessing more fish than permitted by your fishing licence or the fishing quota.  Catch and retain and possession limits may vary by region, fisheries division, individual body of water, or even parts of a body of water. You must determine your “daily” fishing limit for the waters you intend to fish and follow these limits. Remember you may only catch your own limit – there are no provisions for “party” fishing or for excluding fish that you may have consumed or plan to consume that day."

493475,Rich Clemens,2010-08-11 11:19:00,3131,"Here in PA, I've heard of guys getting nailed for sharing a single stringer.  Each one, individually, was under their own limit.  But combined on a single stringer, they assume this belongs to a single fisherman, and put him over the limit.   When using a stringer, I believe, each fisherman must have their own."
493477,Terry,2010-08-11 11:26:00,14456," yes according to the law he has broken it ....... on simcoe they have been enforcing the law with no exceptions, so we are just stating facts.......  most people have not stated whether or not they agree or disagree with the law, only that it is the law.....  and as for keeping fish, I believe the day we stop eatting fish is the day the tree huggers spot a stop to fishing altogether...so eat away"

493480,Terry,2010-08-11 11:34:00,14456,"well if no one admits who owns the fish you all get charged with obstruction of justice once ownership is established, the 2 with their limit get charged..pretty simple  however, if you have a limit of whitefish and there are trout in the area you could be fishing trout and there is nothing wrong with that,,,,,,unless you are really fishing whitefish   once I have my 2 whitefish on the ice I quit fishing and move to where i have a better chance of getting trout or go home..."
493481,DanD,2010-08-11 11:39:00,2223,"This might sound dumb but I can see it happening some day. You plan on going fishing; youll have to go to a licensing outlet and buy tags for whatever species, you plan on targeting? If theres a fish in the live well or on a stringer it better have a tag on it; that's registered to you or who ever claims it.  Dan."
493483,F_ast,2010-08-11 11:45:00,154,"Enormous money grab.  I fully understand and support the conservation laws, but is this not taking it too far?  I mean, who really in their right mind comes up with this stuff?  Yes, conservation is developed to protect species and fisheries, but if a simple error is made, such as 2 guys sharing a stringer for instance, why the money grab?  Why not instead of ""enforcing"" the LAW, promote personal choice conservation though education.  To be honest, I think there are too many people that take fishing and keeping for granted and do no understand the impact.  However, when it comes to the law, it too is written in a way that it is subject to the readers interpretation.  Not so cut and dry.  I know its changing the subject a little, but who else here knows the daily catch vs. possession rules?  It is vaguely written, but if a person catches their possession limit, any fish that you have at home, in the freezer must also be accounted for in that possession and your daily catch allowance.  You cant catch an entire limit out fishing one day and have the same fish on ice at home.  Possession means, in the boat, at home or in storage.  Example.  If a limit is 10, you can have 8 in the boat and 2 at home to make 10.  I didn't hear about this until last year.  Now I don't often keep fish, but its something good to know if you plan too."

See it's easy to figure it out"
493512,canadadude,2010-08-11 13:26:00,769,If you have your limit on your stringer you should stop fishing or at least stop targeting that species and if you do catch another one of that species it should be released
493518,I'mHooked,2010-08-11 13:30:00,525," Would that fish you've just caught for C & R not be considered in your ""possession"" before it's released? Therefore you're knowingly over your limit?  I'm not saying I disagree with you, I'm just thinking from previous threads that the CO's consider the ""catching"" to have added to your possession, whether you've released it or not. Or at least in that brief moment before you release it, and that makes you over your limit?"
493617,bluesky1713,2010-08-11 18:38:00,107,"Maybe I'm just naive, but can you not continue fishing via catch-and-release after you have gotten your limit?"
493619,Kilka,2010-08-11 18:57:00,17," This is wrong. Nobody would be charged with anything. You are allowed to target a fish species you have already limited out on as long as you are going to C&R.  I ice fish Joe quite a bit and at least once a season the CO comes by. I am usually in a group of 3-4 people, he always asks how many fish we have TOTAL, and is fine and on his way as long as number of fish is under the allowed combined possession for the licenses. All our fish go into the same pile, never had a problem with this.  In fact, this is how the law should be. Laws are only useful if they are enforceable. Prohibiting party fishing is not really enforceable in most situations. To change you with party fishing a CO would have to watch you catch more than your limit and put the fish over the limit by your buddy.  I heard they actually do this with binoculars on Simcoe, but I don't really ice fish there anymore. Either way I really doubt a charge like this would stand up in court, which is why it shouldn't even exist in the first place."
493627,Guest gbfisher,2010-08-11 19:36:00,0," Same deal on Joe. It will only be a matter of time till they catch you.  Adding to someone elses limit after you have caught and kept your limit will get you charged for sure. Better yet you will lose everything related to getting you out there to fish as well. Equipment, machines... etc."
