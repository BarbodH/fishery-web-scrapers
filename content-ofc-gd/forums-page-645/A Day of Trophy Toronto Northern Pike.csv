493880,Lunkerhunter,2010-08-12 19:45:00,455,"nice pics, looks like a great day on the water. no way that 38 incher is even close to 20. 12-14 would be more accurate as others have mentioned. either way solid pike boys"
493883,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-08-12 19:58:00,0,"Very impressice pike report right in Toronto's back yard! Regardless of the wieght, those are some very respectable southern Ontario Pike! Nice job and thanks for posting!"
493926,BillM,2010-08-12 23:16:00,17367,Nice fish!  Especially being so close to Toronto..  I'd guess the 38incher goes 13-15lbs at most.
493950,Leecher,2010-08-13 00:49:00,7832,Awesome gators boys Leechman
493953,bje,2010-08-13 00:57:00,11,Nice fish!!!
493980,tdotfisherman,2010-08-13 01:55:00,317," My success in the last few years for Pike has been go big or go home.. I throw nothing but the biggest tackle all year long. Almost Musky sized tackle. Big fish hit big lures.    I don't have a harbour liscence.. I don't have the time to write it.. This means that I don't fish the Islands or Toronto Harbour.. but there are many other spots to be found.. as you can see by my success.   In the future I may not even bother posting a report.. I don't have the energy to go to all the effort of posting just to get guff about verticle holds and imbelishing fish weights..  The bottom line is, nobody was there, the photos in my opinion don't even do the fish justice.. and I know the difference between 12 and 18 pounds.. My buddy's Pike was a lot closer to 18 than it was to 12.  We're going to have to agree to disagree.  Again, I appreciate all the positive feedback from the people who posted such.  -Jason"
493985,BillM,2010-08-13 02:02:00,17367,My suggestion is to not even bother posting the weights and stick to the lengths.
493991,ontariofisherman,2010-08-13 02:07:00,52,"i only know of a couple of places to catch pike like that. wish i had a boat, maybe next year.  humber river  leslie st spit by the marine  bluff's park"
493992,msp,2010-08-13 02:13:00,1336,"This is true. The ""Harbour"" is from the west side of Ashbridges Bay over to Just east of the Humber river. This includes the Leslie St. spit. It is a pretty heafty fine if caught without it. I would recomend writing the test. Its a 3 hour training course with a practical and writen component. $ 15 renewal each year.   T-Dot, never mind the nay sayers, myself included. Keep the reports coming. Just dont start calling out weights unless you actually weighed the fish. This just opens up a can of worms and the arguments start. You got some very nice fish out there."
494018,siwash,2010-08-13 04:45:00,683,"To be honest, I am a bit surprised you caught pike that big at this time of year in that area.  Interesting. . .  It's usually a producer in the spring and fall for that class of fish.  Good work!"
494019,siwash,2010-08-13 04:50:00,683,"The toronto pike fishery is probably better than most of the rest of the accessible places to fish in Ontario  When  I used to fish it, I would have days of 12-15 fish over 12 lb in the spring. 5-10 lb would be avg fish - again, that would be a good day... but a few over 10 was fairly common"
494093,ehg,2010-08-13 14:12:00,2666,"Back in the mid 90's i entered an (all year) large Canada-wide multi-species fishing competition. The couple of years i did enter, always won 'Pike angler of year' just from 2-3 boat trips to the Toronto Harbourfront in the spring. Had many days of dozen pike 35-42 inches. Beating others from NWT, Manitoba, Quebec etc...  It is an underused fishery mainly due to needing a Harbour permit. Geez, gotta find the time to get one..."
493678,tdotfisherman,2010-08-11 23:15:00,317,"Today my buddy Spence and I decided to head out on Lake Ontario to hunt down some Urban Pike.  I haven't been out on Lake Ontario in about 2 months.. and we got skunked our last trip out.  We decided to try a spot we don't frequent too much.. and it paid off HUGE.  We boated 4 fish, all were trophy's (over 30"") and my buddy caught a 38"" monster that was pushing 20 pounds.. what a catch bud!  We had other follows, and short-strikes as well, and all the fish in the area were between 30-40 inches, the big boys were out today..  ALL FISH WERE RELEASED, AND SWAM AWAY FINE, TO BE CAUGHT ANOTHER DAY.. we must respect the resource.  Also, as per usual, I'm blurring out the backgrounds out of respect to shore anglers around Toronto (which I used to be)  Enjoy the photos!   31"" Pike:     My 32"" Pike:     My 36"" Pike.. easily 15 or 16 Pounds:     The 38"" Beast:      "
493682,steverowbotham,2010-08-11 23:20:00,1800,those are some beauty snakes
493695,houski,2010-08-11 23:45:00,61,"Nice fish guys! It's always a bonus when you don't have to go far from home to crush some nice gators! I would put that 38"" at about 12-14 lbs myself, but that's just from the photos."
493696,ehg,2010-08-11 23:51:00,2666,"Being in a boat is way better, allows to cover much more water, especially around the islands. Those are amazing fish, good to see such a robust fishery at the doorstep of Canadas largest city. Try in the fall, larger ones can be found."
493705,smally21,2010-08-12 00:18:00,993,nice fish. cant beleive im only an hour away and have never hit the islands.  where do you fellas launch from to access the islands?
493706,timmeh,2010-08-12 00:20:00,609,"great show man, those are some beasts."
493714,Gregoire,2010-08-12 00:47:00,1397,That is an awesome day. I've never had any luck in the summer in Toronto. What's the secret?
493719,bassman,2010-08-12 00:57:00,384,Nice pike. I've been thinking about some local fishing on Lake O. It's an untapped resource.
493721,highdrifter,2010-08-12 01:05:00,2534,Very nice!  You boys get em casting or trolling?!  And props on using the cradle and blurring out the background.  Respect.  HD
493725,Paully,2010-08-12 01:19:00,712,is the little bridge your launch point? never fished the Islands before..
493727,solopaddler,2010-08-12 01:34:00,8605,"Guess you don't have to fish the Attawapiskat to get big ones.  Well done, very impressive!"

493748,fish_fishburn,2010-08-12 02:30:00,1311,"Nice job lads. Those are nice Northerns, I'm guessing that 38 is around 17lbs hes got decent shoulders on him."
493778,spincast,2010-08-12 09:23:00,3279,nice fish.  Thumbs up on the catch & release...
493784,dave524,2010-08-12 11:24:00,4508," Something similar was my first thought as well, lot of people have spent time and money travelling only to have not done as well, gotta be sweet to have got those in the shadow of the CN Tower, bet there are much bigger ones as well given the access to deep water and that forage base. Well done"
493787,corvette1,2010-08-12 11:45:00,1765,nice gators
493803,tdotfisherman,2010-08-12 13:08:00,317,"Thanks all for the nice replies fellas.. I appreciate it. It was one hell of a day for Gator Hunting!    I couldn't tell you buddy.. I've never fished the Toronto Islands by boat.     We usually have success in the summer.. but we don't usually have this kind of size.. it was a completely unusual and uncalled for type of day. I can get numbers in the summer no problem though.. the key usually is structure.. hit healthy weeds, fallen trees, beaver dams.. there will be Pike.     All these fish were caught by casting.. we were in about 10-15 feet of water.. above deep weedbeds.. the Pike were coming up, following and striking.  I've never had success trolling for Toronto Pike..    Again.. sorry.. I've never fished the Islands by boat.. these Pike were not caught at the Toronto Islands.."
493823,msp,2010-08-12 15:21:00,1336,Nice pike ya got ther T-Dot. Be carefull when estimating pike weights. They can be very deceiving. A 38 inch T.O. pike is about 12- 13 pounds. Nice fish anyway
493825,SudburyAngler,2010-08-12 15:36:00,154,props
493868,Gregoire,2010-08-12 19:04:00,1397,"I have somewhat of an idea of where you were. I need to get a fishing kayak to hit those spots. If I can free up the time I may give her a go in Toronto from to shore tomorrow...maybe even tonight if the wifey will let me off the hook. If you don't mind a quick question: What type of lure size did you find success with? No need for specifics, I'm just wondering if I should bring out some of the bigger stuff if I want to hook into a few."
493870,tb4me,2010-08-12 19:07:00,3295,Nice fish tdot! Love them!!
493871,Oktravis,2010-08-12 19:13:00,62,them some nice fish there boys. I have thought a lot about taking my boat around TO but i don't have a harbor license(or whatever they call it now)did you need the license to get on those fish?  travis
493872,BillsTheBassMan,2010-08-12 19:20:00,932,"Beauty Fish Man!  Some absolute monster urban-gators!  Beautiful!  Also, big props on keeping spots and presentations quiet!"
493876,Gregoire,2010-08-12 19:29:00,1397,  From everything that I have read you need a harbour license if you want to enter the inner harbour. I believe that means the islands and the western part of the spit.
