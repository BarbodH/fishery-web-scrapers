493697,livinisfishin,2010-08-11 23:53:00,661,The cup on mine sticks really well. If you have somewhat of a fingernail it can be pryed off pretty easily. If not then just slide it to the side of the transom and it will have to come off. If you get one you will just have to play around with it and make it work for you!
493709,spinnerbaitking,2010-08-12 00:25:00,1622,"A buddy & I bought a Fishing Buddy side scan pole style for canoeing the Saugeen River we found a few holes that were 11' & over 20' deep that we never knew about, twice when kids were with us the side scan went off & I said there's a fish & I'll catch it & did they were impressed, biggest problem was while we were paddling you couldn't keep the unit in the holder good enough & it would vibrate the side of the canoe very annoying, we also had water get in the screen & cause it to put lines across the screen, Hummingbird always replaced it when it happened but they might have that problem fixed by now, I should check with my buddy to see were it is Richard"
493897,ontariofisherman,2010-08-12 20:29:00,52,"hb 120  this one has side scan, which i think would be more helpful in knee deep weeds on a shallow lake. none of the other portables have this"
493907,adempsey,2010-08-12 21:00:00,1498,"If you can hold off, this new Mark-5X DSI Portable unit from Lowrance looks nice: http://radioworld.ca/product_info.php?cPath=3_205&products_id=8005.  Probably worth a look anyway."
493920,camillj,2010-08-12 22:41:00,1988,Love mine ... HB 565X couldnt imagine life without it ... I replaced the cup early on with a clamp mount .. on the ice I clamp it to a 2 foot section of hockey stick ... it is SOOOO sensitive ... I can actually make out my two minnows AND the single splitshot at 65 feet... I can tell you which Minnow is being hit .. so of course you mark fish ... also it runs just fine on the little 12V rechargeable for about 20 hrs ... I just bring along a spare for the next day and recharge one while I am fishing with the other.
493923,tjsa,2010-08-12 23:06:00,1578,"I never go anywhere without Sonar. Even packing in a couple kilometers. I have an old Eagle SupraPro ID, and have 2 different styles of brackets for the transducer depending on if I am using my 12 ft. aluminum, my buds Scanoe, or my 18 ft. aluminum canoe. Using the Scanoe and my boat, the suction cup works well. I need to transfer it to a 15"" stainless rod for my canoe. It does not decipher fish hooks that well, but we just use it for bottom depth, and we are the fishfinders. We make note of depth when we catch a fish we are targeting, and try to stay at that depth. If the fishing dies off, usually late morning, we generally move a few feet deeper to see where they have moved. This is our method for walleye fishing in small inland lakes."
493925,BillM,2010-08-12 23:14:00,17367,Absolutely..
494042,Billy Bob,2010-08-13 11:53:00,5865,"Actually sonar units do NOT find fish, you do, they only detect and record  them on the screen.  Almost any decent unit on the market now a days will record what's under your boat but the more you spend the better of a unit you get."
494058,scugpg,2010-08-13 12:31:00,1373, The X67 would be a great investment is you're looking for something portable! Plus they are a great unit.  If you go bigger you can always get the ice kit as Terry mentioned.
494068,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-08-13 13:02:00,0," Agreed! I had one that used 2 6V batteries and at $10 a piece it was expensive! Still it helped out quite a lot. I would use a long piece of wood. Drill a hole at the bottom with a bolt and butterfly nut to send threw the transducer. Then I would clamp the wood at the top. If it is not clamped on good? When you start moving it will fall in the water and there goes your clamp! There is also the suction cup method, but that falls off also."
493209,Raycaster,2010-08-10 12:19:00,528,"I just received a few gift cards for Pr@Bass S@ops and was wondering what to purchase.  Just came back from a fishing trip and already stocked the tackle box and basically have a new rod and reel from last year. I get out 3 - 5 times a year for holidays or fishing trips with the brother-In-Laws usually hitting Nippising, Cameron Lake, etc. We end up renting an extra boat (14' - 16' alum) as the relatives boat is more leisure craft and small for fishing. He has a fish finder in the boat and was wondering about picking one up for our rentals.  Anyone have experience with portable fishfinders? I see a couple on their web site that basically mount on the back and a pole telescopes down with the sensor.  The prices are $129 and up and well I might as well use the GCs before I lose them!  I read they are not good for speed but I'm not a trolling type of guy. I love sitting in 10-15 FOW and using the spinners looking for pike/bass.  Suggestions would be welcome."
493214,doubleheader,2010-08-10 12:35:00,497,"I bought one a few years back for a remote trip where I couldn't bring my boat. As a fishfinder they are pretty limited, but as a depth finder they are very useful. As I recall we got about 3-4 days off a set of batteries."
493218,OhioFisherman,2010-08-10 12:44:00,6623,"The last one I used was an old Lowrance model, 35 or so years ago. A good tool for finding depth, changes in bottom contour, useful if you rent boats."
493225,BillsTheBassMan,2010-08-10 13:09:00,932,"Just keep in mind that when you find drop-offs and structure, you find fish.  If the fishfinder doesn't show you fish that well, it really makes no difference - you're looking for structure and drop-offs.  As far as I have seen, most portable fish-finders do that - so yes, they're useful."
493242,alexcba,2010-08-10 14:49:00,634,"i own one. i've recommended it to others on this site aswell. it's the piranhamaxx 160. as a fish finder it works great so long as you learn to use it properly. i personally love it and think it's one of the best investments i've made. its really helped me locate fish in water i was not familiar with. the first time i plugged it in we found a drop off, with a hump in FOW and were in fish all day.  the model i purchased retails for $161.00"
493244,Terry,2010-08-10 14:55:00,14456,I can not imagine fishing with out a fishfinder  I bought the portable ice kit for the HDS5 and use a transducer on a suction cup..works great on rental boats and it came with the iceducer for winter use....
493255,Bondar,2010-08-10 15:53:00,817,I have the Lowrance X67c Ice machine and i love that thing ! i bought the transducer for it to mount on my tinner so all i do is plug in the transducer when i'm in the boat or plug in the Iceducer when on the Ice ! very happy with the unit itself too
493259,mattybculp,2010-08-10 16:02:00,388,i own the humminbird 570 portable. its a little more pricey but you get the bigger screen and battery with it. i would definately recommend it
493263,ironstone74,2010-08-10 16:22:00,201,I have a Humminbird Piranamax 150 that I use in my canoe.  I love it.  It sets up fast and works welll. Not to memtion I got it for $75 used!!!  Paul
493270,NAW,2010-08-10 17:03:00,4022,"IMO they're worth every penny.  I've been using one for a few years now, and have no complaints.  Like other have mentioned, the portables are great on the back of a boat, and even better on the ice.  I never hit the ice without my Humminbird 565.  It will mark the depth of the water through the ice, you don't even need to drill a hole!"
493273,adempsey,2010-08-10 17:19:00,1498,"I'd rather not fish without a depth finder.  I could probably get by with my handheld GPS though (well, as long as I have the bathy map of the lake).  If you ever go ice fishing, then it's an even better purchase for you.  I'd stay away from the units that have the telescoping pole - there are much better in that price range."
493280,smally21,2010-08-10 18:10:00,993,i used the humminbird from ct with the charger and such built in to  the fancy nylon case and base before buying the boat.  full featured fishfinder and portable to boot.
493342,Fisherpete,2010-08-10 21:52:00,1814,"I have had a couple of them over the years (one Eagle, One Humminbird), they work well for the price. As a bonus, I used mine for ice fishing as well. My advice is to stay away from the ones that use ""AA"" batteries (usually 8 of them) - go for one that has a rechargeable battery pack of some sort. It will save you a pile of $ over time. Also, if it is a suction cup type, I prefer to rig up a C-clamp and mount the transducer to a piece of wood - still portable, but more stable giving better readings, and less chance of falling off and getting cut by the prop (been there, done that!)"
493349,jjcanoe,2010-08-10 22:53:00,744,"Well worth the money, but make sure you learn to use it properly, check out you tube for how to videos for the model you buy,  works wonders on a rental boat and as well for ice fishing. One of the biggest advantages it will give you is you can quickly eliminate unproductive waters, the only time I don't use one is when I'm shore fishing or wadeing.  If you sort of know the lake or the rental place/ lodge can give you ideas where to fish, you'll be able to find them much easier, as well as seeing what kind of bottom structure (rocks, sand, mud, weeds etc) is down there.  jjcanoe"
493353,vinnimon,2010-08-10 23:03:00,2593,"I purchased a hummingbird 535 portable a few years ago.I use it ice fishing,in the canoe and my boat as well.Except in my boat I used the old humm100 base,bought a ducer and speed sensor.So if I have a circuit failure,I can stick the cup and ducer on and away I go! Im quit happy with it!"
493354,Raycaster,2010-08-10 23:05:00,528,"thx for all the replies guys, I'm sold.  Now just price/pole/suction cup decisions!  There was a comment poles aren't as good? Isn't the side sonar feature worth it?  Not sure how the suction cups works, possibilities of it falling off?  Again thx for effort guys."
493359,adempsey,2010-08-10 23:19:00,1498," IMO the pole models aren't as good as they use AA batteries and you cannot keep them in the water when you are moving.   The portable unit I have also has side scan.   Personally, I don't use my sonar to find fish but to locate structure.  The only thing I have used that works for finding fish is my flasher.  Never had much faith in the lower end sonar units for finding fish.  Maybe I just don't know how to use them.  Cheers."
493401,RickOnt,2010-08-11 00:56:00,669,Worth IT For Sure!!!  I Use a HB 570 Port. in the Summer on whatever and the HB Ice 55 on the Hard Stuff!!!
493437,ontariofisherman,2010-08-11 02:41:00,52,
493540,Raycaster,2010-08-11 14:38:00,528," Thats the one I had my eye on.  Never owned a Fishfinder before but was always wondering how they would do in weeded areas as well.  I don't mind fishing in ""Cabbage Soup"" like Cache Bay etc. but worry the weeds would cause havoc on the sensors. Depth and rock formation isn't really needed in Cache Bay as it's basically visible.  Scugog... always wanted to visit."
493543,Jet,2010-08-11 14:45:00,364,"If you're going to go the portable route and really want the most for your money, I'd highly suggest spending more and getting one of these:  HB 570PT  Low X67  HB 345C    Or at the very least this: HB 160PT   Anyone will tell you the benefits of a ""good"" fish finder are invaluable, so it is something definitely worth spending at little extra on."
493555,MJL,2010-08-11 15:25:00,2427,You can always turn a non-portable unit into a portable one - although it probably won't be as compact as the the commercially available ones.  In my case I turned a regular Humminbird 343c colour fish finder I got on sale for $220 + a battery and stuck it into a cooler bag for my ice fishing adventures. The portable equivalent to mine at the time was (and still is) the Humminbird 345c which was going for $370.      I plan to try it out in a couple weeks in my canoe.  I'll probably mount the screen of the unit to the bow of the canoe (I usually sit in front when I'm with my dad) and run the battery + transducer cables underneath my seat.
493665,Mike the Pike,2010-08-11 22:02:00,3421,Yes worth it I had a Pirana 4 from humminbird excellent little unit when on a remote lake
493680,livinisfishin,2010-08-11 23:16:00,661,"I have the piranha max 160 seems to be working great. I finally brought it out on georgian bay for the first time and my buddy n I found a nice little drop pulled out three small mouth over the side of the boat. Previously I had only used it on the lake I live on (Orr Lake), very shallow and small aswell as a mainly sandy bottom. I found it great to finally be able to see the depths aswell as know when a fish was swimming under the boat!"
493690,Raycaster,2010-08-11 23:36:00,528,Awesome pics showing the portability of the units.  Would it be a hassle or tough to constantly change the suction cup on rental boats?  I could really see the extended pole get tangled up on weeds quickly.
