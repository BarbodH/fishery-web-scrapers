493423,solopaddler,2010-08-11 01:54:00,8605,If you read my recent post about my trip to Chapleau you'll know I really beat up my 16' flatback Sportspal.  My uncle offered to drop my boat off at the factory in North Bay for me as he was driving through last Friday enroute to his camp.  Here's the list of things I needed done:  Both foam sponsons replaced.  Aluminum front deck at bow of canoe replaced.  Thwart directly behind bow seat replaced.  Carry handle at bow removed and re-rivited (it was horribly loose).  Re-caulk seams inside and out. (After the bush bash it leaked a bit. Calking the inside is major as it nessecitates the removal of the inner foam and aluminum ribs)  Touch up entire boat with a matching can of spray paint.  In any event I get a call from Steve the manager of the sportspal factory.  They're going to fix everything on my list. In addition he offered to prep and paint my entire boat in their paint booth to make it right rather than just touch it up.  Guess how much the entire bill is with taxes?  $208  I can't believe it.  On top of that he was a true pleasure to deal with on the phone and will have my baby ready for pick up when I drive through there on Friday.  I am pleased.

493479,splashhopper,2010-08-11 11:31:00,2931,"can your uncle grab my canoe and take it with him too.  If  they only charge that to do all that, I will have a ""grand total"" of $258.00 invested in my 12' Sportspal.  And I am ok if they just paint right over the chiefs head on it too!  lol"
