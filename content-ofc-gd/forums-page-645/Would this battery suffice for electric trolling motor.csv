494184,Hooked,2010-08-13 19:20:00,891,I was looking for a cheap battery that I can use for my transom mount trolling motor.  What are  your thoughts on this one?  Would it suffice?  I have an older 3 HP Minn Kota.  Reason I want a cheap one is because it will only be used sparingly for the trolling motor.  12-Volt Battery

Call them up and see if they have any deep cycles. They may charge you 50$ or so. They still give you the warranty as well. By refurbished were talking they were scratched on the assembly line, thus Interstate wont put their name on it. If your going to spend the money, do it right. Im sure you will get a much longer life out of it too. Just a thought."
