490038,Terry,2010-07-30 22:19:00,14456,sure show pictures of a walleye...I just don't really believe they are in the lake...LOL  if Paul or Joey come on line they can tell you I would think they would check the water temp while they were there this weekk
490103,TroutnMuskieHunter,2010-07-31 10:37:00,1362,Have fun Rob!.......we were up there between July 4th - 11th....that was the week of the heatwave..Water temp when we launched the boat at the hub was 67F and by midweek it soared to 78F  ...Walleye were plentiful but most were caught in the evening..here's my buddy with the biggest...  Never seen the water so low...I was talking to a guy that was on his 4th prop during his 2 week stay  
490105,lew,2010-07-31 12:28:00,12766," That's brutal Steve, and also VERY $$$$"
490108,TroutnMuskieHunter,2010-07-31 12:58:00,1362," Lew, I gave him a call yesterday and he told me that he took the boat in to one of the local Marinas here in the west end because the motor hasn't been running well since he got back.....the mechanic told him the gears are all chipped/cracked in the lower unit.....$8000  he's putting a claim through his insurnace now"
490120,lew,2010-07-31 15:22:00,12766,"Wow, that un-expected $8000 make for a pretty expensive fish'n trip Steve, hopefully the insurance company will cover the cost of the 4 new props too."
490121,TroutnMuskieHunter,2010-07-31 15:35:00,1362,For sure Lew.....I had no issues with the new ride but I also have the latest Navionics card for my HDS-5....what a blessing that is!!!!......it's his next investment
490418,walleyemaster,2010-08-02 04:21:00,325,the water was low when i was there in the beginning of june..i have that hds unit as well and also helps if you have some knowledge of the lake.. $ 8000 lots of money and lots of tears...temagami is an unforgiving lake..
490419,walleyemaster,2010-08-02 04:24:00,325,
490459,Fang,2010-08-02 13:34:00,1330,Will be on the lake from the 14th to 20th just around the hub. Been a while since I was up there in August. Sounds like the waters warm for swimming and the lake is still low. I target smallies and lakers. Never had too much success on the big lake for walleyes. Not for trying though just never found a reliable spot. One here one there.
494300,walleyemaster,2010-08-14 02:45:00,325, will be there tomorrow...cant wait
494302,Joey,2010-08-14 02:54:00,9122,"If I recall correctly, water temp was averaging about 72 to 74 deg.  Great for swimming  Joey"
494351,spincast,2010-08-14 11:44:00,3279,"71 degrees when we were there last week, and about 2ft below average. This shot probably shows it pretty well. Last Year the water was at the top of the docks..."
