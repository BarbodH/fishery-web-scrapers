We went on Sunday but a little too late. We spoke with some people there and they informed us to ""come early"" So we did. We hit fish the first cast. We nailed perch bass sunfish, I caught a jumbo perch and a decent 2 lb bass. We were losing bait like crazy but the kids had fun!!!!! Again thanks for the hook up guys"
