494039,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-08-13 11:44:00,0,"Yup I guarantee these people are either cottage owners or they have close friends that own cottages and are trying to score brownie points. If I owned my own cottage, do you think I would stop fishing docks? Don't be ridiculous.  Thats like people that own a house and try to restrict people using the sidewalk. Doesn't matter if you interlock, cut the grass, pave it or whatever. You dont own the sidewalk and people are free to use it. Whether they may be black, white, noisy, smelly, or whatever.  The dock is for your conveinience. It is not a right. It does not give you automatic right to the waters surrounding it.  I think its funny how these people think that us lowly fishermen should bow to cottage owners because they are so successful or because they inherited some piece of property.  Where do you come from? Communist Russia or chaste system India?  The longer this thread gets? The more desire I have to fish docks! Lucky I'm going for surgery but next year I will pound them silly."
494041,cram,2010-08-13 11:51:00,1733, Pretty sure everyone who's posted in this thread is a lowly fisherman (including those who don't fish docks).
494047,lew,2010-08-13 12:01:00,12766,Just my opinion but I think this thread has gotten a loooong ways off topic from where it started.  A guy had his boat tied to his dock and some fisherman made a cast and snagged his seat. If anyone here wouldn't be pi$$ed if that happened to THEIR boat I'd be interested in hearing why ??
494048,Terry,2010-08-13 12:01:00,14456, but those who say cottage owners have some special right to the water around them..after reading my post how is your problem any different then my every day life  i would never be so arrogant to think that people do have every right to use public property along my little piece of heaven...  why do you think you have some special right to control public property around you house   please answer the question or admit you were wrong....
494059,Roy,2010-08-13 12:33:00,13728,This one really has gone on long enough. All this is doing now is breeding contempt.
493519,jughead,2010-08-11 13:32:00,92,"Over the course of the 8 years I have owned my cottage I have found around 10 lures - one snagged on the swimming ladder attached to the dock, most snagged on the rocks in the shallow swimming area, a husky jerk snagged on the water line when I was taking it out for the winter, a tube jig inside the boat caught on the tow rope we use for skiing and tubing. I have heard my boat hit a couple of times from errant casts. Last weekend I actually watched a guy hit my kicker motor on my fishing boat with a spinner. I have been on my dock with my family and watched a guy trolling by about 15 feet in front of the dock and flick a cigarette into the water.  I have also found various pop cans, beer bottles, etc, floating around but this is as much an issue with pleasure boaters than it is with fishermen (probably more. Although I have watched Styrofoam worm containers fly out of boats and the people just ignoring them and leaving them in the water.  I have seen my neighbors 5 year old being carted off to the hospital with a barbed hook deep in her foot.  My friend across the lake whose property is a weedy bay that no one but a fisherman would ever be in actually came up one weekend to find someone had come ashore and taken a crap near his dock.  Now, having said all of this, I fish a ton. I rarely fish docks since, at least on the handful of lakes I regularly fish, I find them less productive. I realize most fishermen are conscientious and respectful. I don't feel I have more right to the water than those who are boating there. I do however have a different view of etiquette based on experience.  Look at it this way, you don't own the street in front of your house and it is perfectly legal for people to park there. However, if they park there and start throwing a baseball which occasionally hits your car, start chucking cigarette butts on the ground, relieve themselves on the edge of your driveway,(yes I have seen a guy take a leak a few feet away from my dock) and toss litter onto your lawn, you are probably going to be upset and would prefer people didn't do that, in fact, just didn't park there at all, even though it is their right."
493538,mbac31,2010-08-11 14:34:00,904,"Some very valid points indeed. I fish docks a ton but have never left a lure or anything else of that matter attached to one. I agree, if you dont have excellent lure control, dont cast random ones hoping to hit a target.  Yes docks on certian lakes will hold fish better then natural structure.  I will continue to do so but keeping that in mind, I will never fish in a swimming area, or while anyone is around and sometimes if its a good dock holding fish and I see the person I will usually do a quick asking if its ok. I rarely come into contact with a cottager as most people usually can tell if you are respectfull and it all boils down to common sense.  I do run into the odd cottager yelling and I keep going without saying anything as this usually works best. You move on, they get their feathers up and feel as if they scared me off but its usually left at that. I will say one thing though. I currently have a Kawarthas cottager charged for various reasons beyond my control as this person is an idiot. I own a cottage and like anything you will never get total compliance in any sport or activity and it will never change. People will be angry no matter what. Its how  you go about dealing with it which is what matters. I tend to be the better man always and leave.  There was knowone near this floating dock, Wednesday afternoon and I was targeted by an ASS. He soon realized that his actions were wrong and is trying to get the charges dropped but he was charged by the OPP and not me. They are asses in every day life and it is what it is.  Treat others with respect on and off the water and things will be fine."

493559,Governator,2010-08-11 15:43:00,879,So there's this public sidewalk that runs right next to everyones front lawn.  When a dog stops to take a dump on it I start looking to see if the homeowner is going to come out and yell at the dog's walker for the excrement left behind... but wait!  The dog walker pulls out a bag and retrieves the waste like a responsible human being.  It's just a common sense people...  don't leave a hook on someone's dock and be respectful to their property.
493571,jbailey,2010-08-11 16:00:00,866," It's fine to go fast, but you don't have to do it 10 ft from my boat. I used the word SHARE, but apparently that can be twisted into something selfish... and actually to me ""It means"" just being respectful and aware of each others presence."

493837,bubbles,2010-08-12 17:07:00,591, Watch our for this dude!    This is my favorite quote from the article  Do these fishermen care more about the fish they hope to catch than the people who are trying to enjoy their time with family and friends at their cottage?  You Betcha!
493939,camillj,2010-08-13 00:11:00,1988,"FLAME ON  You know ... I never fail to be amazed by the lack of insight of a few of our members ... its enough to make me ashamed to be part of the fishing community.  How anyone can defend their right to intrude upon the RIGHTS of privacy to any landowner is beyond me. We all know your neighbor HAS EVERY RIGHT to plant a lawn chair one inch off your lot line, or on a sidewalk and face it right into your living room window ... but it would be simply RUDE and inconsiderate and will guarantee a neighbor who has no respect in turn for you - so why would you think that is ok to do it from a boat.  Using the need to catch that special fish from under someone elses dock or raft as an excuse to intrude on people's pleasure and enjoymenyt is simply that - an excuse.  Get a life ! Just because you cant afford to own a piece of the waterfront doesnt make it ok to ruin it for those who do.  FLAME OFF  Be nice people - its alot more fun for everyone."

493962,alphaalpha,2010-08-13 01:16:00,475,"  I'm not sure if this is directed at all people fishing any docks or not but if it is give me a break pal.  I only fish the docks that people aren't using and are no where near the water...what is the harm in that?  I rarely fish a dock for more than a few minutes at a time then move on anyways, there are ways where everyone can enjoy the water.  Also I whole-heartedly disagree with this comment: ""Just because you cant afford to own a piece of the waterfront doesnt make it ok to ruin it for those who do.""  I highly doubt anyone in their right mind fishes docks with the intent on ruining your experience because they can't afford a waterfront cottage of their own. Also many of us can easily afford a cottage but don't want to spend nearly every weekend in one spot.  Maybe it's just the wording of your post but you come across as the type of person that comes storming out of his cottage to shoo the fishermen away.  If you are I will quote you in your own words  ""Get a life!""  AA."
493969,kerr,2010-08-13 01:37:00,77,"camillj is wrong and so is ctranter for that matter, johnny bass is an ambassadeur for canadian sportfishing and i would let him take a dump on my dock anyday, if the water is used appropriatly there should be no issues, how is it disrespectful to fish docks? get real"
493994,Terry,2010-08-13 02:20:00,14456," funny as a fisherman I think you should be ashamed ......they do not own the lake or the water under their dock as most have said they do not fish them when people are on them........but the home owner has no more rights then the fishermen and with the new laws about harassing fishermen, the fishermen probably has more rights. so the maybe you are looking at it wring and you should thank the fisherman the bypasses your dock because you are on it...  but really it's a balancing act on both sides... the thought that the dock owner has more rights then the fisherman is only in your mind....  it's all personal opinions and like A holes everyone has one and that is all it is, if it's not the law it's just something you got into you head and only is important to you"
493997,camillj,2010-08-13 02:37:00,1988," Actually, no I am not a cottage owner, but I am the kind of fisherman who places my respect for others above my own need to pursue any particular pleasure - especially if it is clearly at their expense. I am not suggesting that fishing a dock is wrong - but it is simply not good manners to intrude on any landowners privacy - whatever your activity - remember you can move - they can't - there is ALOT of public property (and water) to use freely without making a nuisance of yourself -  and being all self-righteous about your right to do it - is exactly the attitude I am ashamed of.

Also how big of a bubble would you like us to give around a cottage? What if there is a good drop off just off the dock that holds nice fish and we fish that.  Should we be 20 feet away...50 feet...500???  ""and being all self-righteous about your right to do it - is exactly the attitude I am ashamed of."" You have got to be kidding me posting this after your last post about us ruining cottagers experiences because we ""can't afford our own"".   I am not self-righteously making a nuisance of myself.  The same goes for the majority of people fishing docks from reading this thread.  Most of us ARE respectful of cottagers privacy and DO do our best to not impact anyone else's experience.  If anyone has a self-righteous attitude it is you sir...just because you don't think it right to fish docks doesn't mean it is wrong for anyone else to do it.  EVERYONE can enjoy the water if they are mindful of others.  It really doesn't matter what laws are in place or not, there will always be idiots that give the particular group they are in a bad name.  It's sad but that's just the way it is...  AA."

And he is giving me dirty looks, on the phone like he is calling the cops, and then telling me I should find someone else's cottage to fish in front of. Maybe he didn't like the fact I was pulling pickerel off the spot, and that they were ""his' pickerel.  Just to add? This shoreline was completely unswimable."

Maybe your original statement was or maybe it wasn't but I promise. I won't lose any sleep over your opinion.lol  I know the problem is not me. Its cottagers who think they own the lake. You know how many times I fished a dock with people watching me and cheering as I'm pulling out fish right from their dock? Even the guests were impressed.  Spare me the condescending tone.  I thought my initial post was quite intellectual. Sorry it didn't hold up to your holier than thou standards.

492848,markiemark70,2010-08-09 13:53:00,158,"I am very interested in this discussion, and I thought I would share my opinion just before it gets locked.  I can see it from both sides: I love to fish docks and catch fish, but I would never go near a dock when the cottagers are there. And I remember the story that someone posted about the kid getting hooked on the dock (it was posted here once before, deja vu?) and that has taught me the importance of retrieving hooks should I ever get snagged on one.  I think the issue is between people who own property and those who don't. Sorry if it sounds condescending, but those who have not sacrificed to purchase a little slice of the world for themselves can't understand why people would take it personally to have someone disrespect that. I myself would have probably been on the other side of the argument until a few years ago when I purchased my first home. My attitude was, and the attitude I am hearing in this thread is ""What, do you think your special because you bought some property?"" And the answer for me is Yes. I feel like I have sacrificed and worked to get where I am and that should afford me a bit of respect around my property, within reason of course.  As for the difference between what's right vs what's legal, my favourite example is from a forgettable movie I saw a few years back: Two men are in a restaurant and man 1 decides to light up a cigar. Man 2 says ""Excuse me, would you mind not smoking that here? I am trying to eat. Man 1 says ""There is no law that says I can't smoke this here."" Man2 replies: ""I'm not talking about laws, I am talking about courtesy. You see, there is no law that says I can't walk over there and fart all over your entree, but that wouldn't be very nice would it?""  Bout sums it up.  In before the lock."
492861,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-08-09 14:17:00,0," Yup. First its the docks and once the cottages have surrounded the shores, its the shorelines, So we better start practicing drop shooting in deeper waters. Because the cottage owners are more special than us lowly fishermen.  Maybe little by little they will eventually own the entire lake and we can be like England where we have to pay stupid amounts of dollars to fish lakes. Yes, fishing should be a privilege only indulged by the wealthy.  In the meantime, I will continue to fish docks."
492871,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-08-09 14:40:00,0," And most of us with the brain the size of a pea, think they are smarter than everyone else.  It has to be all the scientists that are hanging around these fishing forums, having to lower their intellect to communicate with all us fishing Neanderthals.lol"
492889,cram,2010-08-09 15:26:00,1733,"Johnny -- i think if you're on a lake where the shoreline is monopolized with cottages, then obviously you're going to fish in front of ""someone's"" place if you want to be near the shoreline.  On the other hand, if there's lots of shoreline aside from the cottages, why not just go there instead?   I mean, is a bass under someone's dock *that* valuable to you?  If there were no docks would you give up fishing?  I don't fish docks, and i catch a ton.....have a lot of fun doing it, and am not irritating anyone by doing it.  Here's an example for you -- one of the cottages on my lake has a little beachthat i know just has to hold musky early in the season when they're looking to warm up.  Even though i know it has to hold fish, and i'm legally in the right to do it (its public water, not owned by the cottage owner) i just won't fish it.   I know that with my 80 lb test there's no way i'm goign to lose a lure in there for a kid to get hooked on........but the fact i'm going to be irritating (or worrying) that cottage owner makes me ignore that spot and fish somewhere else.  Assuming you'd fish it?"
492900,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-08-09 15:55:00,0," I hardly fish docks and if you read my reports I am a highly versatile fisherman. I'm always learning new techniques.But I do fish docks from time to time.  Depends on what you mean by beach. Shallow and sandy(no chance of snaggin)? No one swimming? And there are big musky there? Sure. Most people would. Rocky? Not if I knew it was a designated swimming area. Maybe he should put some buoys and ropes around the swimming area.  How many people fish Balsam Lake provincial park's beach early in the morning(even though I do not)?  I know some fishermen that are so addicted to catching fish they don't care about ethics.. I've even been with guys that because they couldn't catch pike and walleye early season, decided to target bass. I refused to fish and never got invited again but that's fine with me.  Although radnine tried to label me as a rude fisherman? I am one of the most ethical fisherman around and am one of the most reasonable people around. But if someone is rude to me, I can be rude back like anyone else.  If the guy gets aggitated by people fishing water in front of his property that just happens to be a prime fishing habitat, he should sell and buy another cottage. There is this one lake I go on. This guy has a dock and a floating dock in the lake. This floating dock holds ALOT of big fish. He was constantly telling people to stop fishing the dock. He finally got fed up and sold the cottage. This spot is probably the best known spot on the lake and well fished by the locals. Does he have more rights then the other locals?"
492911,cram,2010-08-09 16:14:00,1733," I tend to agree with everything Radnine has said.  And, you seem to be throwing all cottageowners who don't like people fishing their cosk into the same bucket as the few who have been hot-heads with you.   I think that'd be like lumping all fishermen into the bucket of those who have trolled by or casted to my dock while its occupied, or even worse - when people are swimming off it.  As for the beach -- i just won't fish them, regardless of time of day.  I dont care if others do it.....if its someone's swimming beach, its not for fishing regardless of the likelihood of a snag.  btw - i'm also not on the kawartha lakes.  Maybe its different there (higher concentration of docks, whereas my lake seems to be 2/3 uninhabited, and likely 80-90% at our end of the lake)....but i have to think there's a lot of structure available without fishing docks."
492914,markiemark70,2010-08-09 16:19:00,158," Just curious, why not fish a beach if there is absolutely noone there? What is there to snag on? I agree that I would not fish a dock if there are any landowners visible in the water or not, but I see nothing wrong with fishing unoccupied waters so long as you are responsible enough not to leave anything behind."
492916,lew,2010-08-09 16:19:00,12766,"My fishing days all seem soooo boring compared to some of the days you guys seem to have.  Nobody ever yells at me, I never have to yell back at THEM, nobody throws stones at me or threatens to call the cops, no one drives their boat at me to scare me away, or even dives in the water and swims around me to scare the fish away  I just go out on the lake, maybe catch a fish or 2 if I'm lucky, and then go home again  Maybe I need to take up dock fishing to add some excitement to my days on the water"
492922,Harrison,2010-08-09 16:32:00,2202,"Either have I Lew and I have fished at least a couple thousand docks over the years.  Especailly on Scugog, we used to run up to the river from Port, put the troller down and fish docks as far as we could for the day.  Now, I have had guys ask me to leave, I've had guys warn me not to fish their dock(top of the island as an example) and had one threaten to call the police(Marina).  On the other hand, I've had applause after I caught one, I've thrown some folks on the shore some of the baits I was using, and I've had some great chats with some owners around fishing on the lake, water levels etc...  I was fishing a T on Cameron lake one year and we won it on docks.  My partner for the day had a great line when he zinged a 5lber between the docks and we hear a guy yell from the cottage ""HEY, that's Henry"" to which my P responded, ""we're just borrowing him, he'll be back"".  I've been using that ever since."
492924,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-08-09 16:34:00,0," You're entitled to your opinion. I see you have a hard time comprehending my posts. I even said I can see the point of SOME cottage owners, but you have no right to be rude to a fisherman. Who do these people think they are? They do not own the lake.  If people eventually start mouthing off, and throwing stuff at boaters? They will eventually get charged or even worse, catch a beating. Now if you told someone to leave nicely, repeatedly, and they didn't move, then that's when ethics comes into play. Most decent people would leave, unless I guess in the case of a tournament angler trying to win some money.  All I was saying is try to be nice. It will get you further in life.  Do a poll and see who would fish the beach area if there were big muskies known to patrol it?lol"
492929,cram,2010-08-09 16:48:00,1733,"Johnny -- i fish beaches.....natural ones.  I don't fish swimming areas, whether there's a likelihood of snagging or not.  I know i'm not going to leave a lure on the beach (esp. with 80 lb test), but the guy watching from his cottage doesn't know that so it could be ruining his morning a bit to worry about his kids getting stuck with left-behind-lures ......to me there's no point bothering anyone, whether i'm legally entitled to it or not.  Lots of water and natural structure to fish."
492943,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-08-09 17:16:00,0, I didn't even wave. I just kept fishing.  He doesn't own the entire shoreline.
492945,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-08-09 17:18:00,0, If the fishing area is a known designated swimming area? And I know there is a chance of a snag? I will also not fish the area.  I've had hooks stuck in me and it is not a good feeling at all.

I would have an issue if fisherman left hooks and lures scattered all over my property, but that is never the case.  I have a little daughter, a very active swimming Yellow Lab and friends at our cottage all the time.  I have never once had an issue with someone snagging bottom or our dock and leaving a lure.  One thing about cottagers creating a ""No fishing docks"" law.  I beleive this would open an enormous can of worms.  No pun intended.  What about cottagers than enjoy fishing from their dock?  You cant have a law that states because you own property near a public place, you have the right and someone else does not.  I personally thing more cottagers enjoy the ability to fish from than not. This would be a real heart breaker for the kids, that's for sure."

I have people who send their kids into the water to help stop us from fishing..how stupid is it to do that to your kids  I was fishing a shoreline out from barrie, not docks, an older women 50 feet behind us jumps in the water and swims right at my boat as she gets close an old man on the dock starts yelling at us to get the hell away from where she wants to swim...she culd have swam any direction she wanted but chose to swim right at us and we are the bad guys.......right  remember if we want we can show up with 25 boats anchored 10 ft off your shore line and party all wekend long and there is nothing you can do about it, but we are not like many of the ignorant cottagers who really believe they own the lake, so we would not do it"
492497,ctranter,2010-08-08 14:38:00,543," I completely understand your point of view... which is exactly why I avoid your scar analogy situation.  I don't ""run"" the lake.  Rather I put extra effort into getting to know the visitors.  Every single one has been extremely grateful that I, who has the same right to use the lake as anyone else, goes the extra mile to make it a better place.  I've made friends, invited them to my cottage for dinners, shared many beers, and raised lots of awareness as a result.  The fact is most of these visitors don't intend to be sloppy campers.  Take the toilet example, until I told one group of guys that I had the water quality tested, and that fecal bacteria was found in the water, they had no idea that their makeshift toilets were the adding to the problem.  Since then, I have noticed far less of these toilets, and far less cleanup.  Sometimes a little education can go a long way.  I've never met a camper that thought I was controlling over this space, especially when I show good faith and share some free beers with them.  Every visitor I get to know has thanked me for my efforts.  As for the personal comments, the problem with the internet is that it is very easy to misread comments.  I'm not afraid to speak my mind, and I am opinionated, but I in no way take a passive aggressive stance, as you have indicated.  I find it somewhat frustrating that I have to justify my positive intentions (keeping the lake clean and maintaining awareness for the cause.  If you watched someone poach out of season fish, hunt illegally, or abuse natural resources in another way, (and were 100% sure the MNR would be unable to enforce it) wouldn't you say something to them?  How am I any different when it comes to littering my little piece of paradise?  Any of you are welcome to visit my lake, the bass fishing is extraordinary."

492518,Cookslav,2010-08-08 15:08:00,1457,"Personally I think its rude to fish someones dock. I'm a fisherman and I avoid them out of courtisey, and safety for the owners.  Before you jump on me... I ask you this, If you fish a dock are you willing to drive in and remove your hook if you snag on their dock posts, or latter, or what have you?  I know of a little girl who simply swam at her family dock, and was teathered to the dock by some   hooks.... They left their snagged lure below the surface of the dock, and because of their neglegance a sweet 4 year old girl got stitch apon stitch, and needle apon needle who is also now petrified to swim in the lake....  People swim at docks...children swim at docks. Like it has been said there is lots of water to fish, and if you are that hell bent on fishing a dock I only ask that you remember this story when your casting, and be willing to get wet and remove that snagged hook. If your not, ask yourself why? Is that Bass you think might be there worth potentially drowning or injuring a child?  Put things in perspective and think about it. Fishing a ""vacant"" dock is no better then an occupied dock....a bit more stealthy, but the same consequence is in play. (and no....I don't own a dock)"
492525,Terry,2010-08-08 15:26:00,14456," it's easy for someone to say that when you don't want to fish them  hell I really respect land owners and spawning fish, so I never ever ever fish rivers or creeks and anyone that does is a ignorant pig who has no respect for land owners or fish populations .......  and my kids walk in those streams and come out with 10 or 15 hooks in their feet every time the wade in there in bare feet clearly I am kidding but it's easy to say because I don't care if they put a ban on stream fishing from shore or wading............"
492539,Radnine,2010-08-08 16:22:00,1538," First of all, I apologize for my response as it was a little on the harsh side, as well as being judgemental. I personally don't fish docks, so like Terry points out it is easy for me to come down on the side of the cottagers. Also, I hold cottagers (for the most part) in high regard because I think it is a representation of a level of success in life to which I might aspire. Lots around lakes are sold, cottages are built, and so are docks. It gives me a place to rent and to park my boat, and as far as I am concerned, they are as much a part of the fabric of fishing as a boat is. If there is one factor that I think might get overlooked in this argument it is that the dock was installed by the cottager, as opposed to a tree falling down to provide structure/cover. If the dock wasn't there where would you fish? I know that the cottager does not own the lake bed that the dock sits on or the water under it, but I think deserves the benefit of the doubt when it is essentially ""used"" for something for which it was not intended. I don't own the road in front of my house (or for that matter, the first three feet or so of my lawn) but I darn sure think that I would have the right to tell someone to shove off that decided to throw litter there, or park their car there with the music cranked, etc. I guess I am saying that the investment in the land and the structures on it do give the cottager the upper hand if it were to come down to a pissing contest. And that is perhaps why I don't join the contest in the first place. Jim"
492551,Cookslav,2010-08-08 16:54:00,1457," I don't mean any disrespect Terry, But I think its a different Situation alltogether. If I sent my Kids down to a creek or trib, to start I wouldn't let them be walking bare foot, and secondly they are wadeing in knee high water. Swimming at a dock is deep water, kids cling to the dock with their hands, feet....bellies I think its way differnt Also a trib or creek is not usually the site of a private dwelling, or private recreational swimming area. Where as a Dock unless posted as a municiple run facitiy is soley private... Yes the water under and around is public and I'm not debateing that. I'm debating the morality of putting people in harms way for the sake of catching a fish. The situation is vastly different in both its common uses and expectation of safe conditions IMO.  Being a fisherman or not is inconsequential to the oppinion I hold. I beleive it is wrong because I've personally seen the damage it can do. I've fished docks in the past but now that I realize the potential hazzards it poses... I put my self in those shoe, and walked off a few miles. I Decided I don't EVER want to be responsible for putting a kid through that, and I can't imagine the guilt I would feel if the act had been the contributing factor in a drowning. Especially when its all for the sake of catching a fish...know what I mean? No sir I won't do it, and yes I hope everyone who read this at the very least thinks twice about it, and maybe exersisies more of an effort to remove snagged hooks ect...  And I ain't call'n nobody a ignorant Pig  ....yet  Cheers,"
492559,Terry,2010-08-08 17:06:00,14456,"and of course everyone has an opinion on these things...I can say 100% I have never left a hook in a dock or near a dock  it is 100% legal to fish docks so I will continue to fish them when the feeling moves me... and because I am 100% within the law anyone that tries to stop me or interferes with me is breaking the law .....  as I tried to point out in my last post it's legal so leave them alone yell at the law makers  if you don't like white bucket fishermen..too bad..leave them alone and try to change the law not the legal fisherman...  every other fisherman that doesn't fish the way we do is a pig and only the type of fish I do is real fishing and only my way of fishing doesn't hurt the environment ...this type of thinking has to stop if we argue amongst ourselves if the issue isn't the same type of fishing we do, how will we ever stand up against all the forces trying to end fishing and hunting..we need to respect all types of legal fishing and hunting"
492569,cram,2010-08-08 17:20:00,1733," Also ""legal"" for paparazzis to follow celebrities around or park out in front of their house at the hope of catching a picture.   Sometimes being ""legal"" doesn't make something right.  I love fishing, love the structure offered by docks, but i won't ever fish other cottager's docks.  I suspect most of those who own cottages (and many who don't) feel the same way.  And, just remember -- for every hothead cottager who actually comes down and acts like an ass yelling at you (which i also don't agree with) there are 10 non-hotheads who just shake their head and think ""another jerk fisherman""."
492573,Terry,2010-08-08 17:30:00,14456,and if you want to become an actor you know that paparazzi will follow you everywhere and you except that as part of being a celebrity and if they break the law they will be charged but if the actor assaults them then they will be charged...as will cottagers......it has nothing to do with respect or lack of respect when it comes to docks...they are open game they are legal and if you want to live on the water you will learn to live with it or move.......  and at this point in the game I will have any home owner that harasses me while legally fishing charged under federal law that protects fishermen ...and we will continue to disagree on this subject

492593,fish-miester,2010-08-08 18:42:00,864,"I love this site! moral of the story here.. both parties have there sides.. cottage owners want there personal space as well as there docks clean and hook free. and well us anglers want to fish structure. and well this is where the cottager and the angler clash. both have the privilege. tho no one is in the right or wrong..  First off I find that dock owners treat the weekend warrior/av joe much better then the guys in the fancy dancy Bassboats the lakes I fish anyways no matter where/what I am fishing.  do I believe its wrong to fish docks. no not at all...and well I love flipping/pitching/skipping a dock, its actually one of my favorite techniques and have caught some great fish. tho its not my only technique I use. but when I do, I have my own personal guideline I use.  - when I pull up to a dock I first check for people any where in/near the water.(if so I pass up the dock. if not i continue) - when I plan to make my F/P/S I never half   it as I dont want the lure to go astray to cause any grief. - then If there is a boat tied up I 99.9% of the time only throw a texas rigged soft plastic in respect to the persons property (no scratches etc) if no boat I'll throw a jig or anything else. -if there are excessive ropes,wires or home made ""lure catchers""(for example pieces of ply wood tied to the dock with screws all over them) etc hanging off the dock I will either pass up this dock or i will fish the outskirts of the dock. - In the case I do get snagged I give it 110% to get that lure back. (A- For the safety of the people using the dock. swimming around or dissembling a dock (B- because $7 jigs can really add up! In the past I have been known to get out of my boat and search for my lure tho the only lures I have ever lost to a dock are those that I skip 3/4 up to the back of the dock not knowing that there is a cross beam/rope or other obstacle waiting for my innocent lure. In this case I try my hardest to retrieve the lure. and well sometimes its just not possible. in that case I try my hardest to tell the owner. and well I have had them freak out on me but normally my reply is ""wouldnt you rather be warned of this instead of finding out another way"" (as well that its not likely a place one would be swimming (aprox 1.5' underwater under the back of a dock..)  other then that I try my best to respect the property owners/renters and if am asked to leave I do so. as well as always reply with yes sir/ma'am and alot of the times after pulling the nice guy they actually apologize for being rude and some have even told me not to leave. but I normally do anyways.  -As for the cottager, I can understand the fact that they want there privacy as well a lure free/safe dock for there family and or friends to enjoy. and If your really dont want people fishing around it the best thing I can say is to (A- Be Polite (ask them to respect your dock, and retrieve all snags, whether you say it in person or attach a sign to the end of the dock. or put out some ""noodle bouys and close off the side of your dock.) this will help confrontation with those who fish docks. much better then storming down to the water front to catch the angler off guard and continue to harass him or her in various ways..(meanwhile your beer is getting warm) as well keep in mind you and the angler are just trying to enjoy yourselves on your day/s off.. just in different ways. whether you see it that way or not..and your just wrecking it for yourselves by confronting each other. (no need to huff and puff) (tho there are some who live for confrontation so who knows you might be makeing there day.. but thats another story..) some one fishing a dock regularly only makes about 4 Casts/flips max. then moves on. its not like he or she is setting up camp at the end of your dock for to wreck your weekend. (just relax it will be over soon)  other then that I cant stress enough Be polite and respectful. If you want/like to flip docks practice at home or on your own dock. (clip off the hook on a jig and pitch under couches. use card board boxes or if you think your that good glasses/cups and if you think your a reel pro try an old shot glass! then after you have done your time practicing go try it out. and I guarantee you'll be better! which means shorter/more productive fishing time around a single dock. which can lead to less head aches from both you the angler and the dock owner.  Just My Two Cents. -Alex"
492597,jbailey,2010-08-08 18:51:00,866,"what about the cottagers who blatently fly by you at 30-40km damn well knowing you're trying to fish. I was recently at Six Mile Lake and it was ridiculous.

492628,otter649,2010-08-08 20:19:00,118,Good chance where the fisherman has parked his vehicle/trailer & launched his boat for free - The cottagers' taxes or cottage association fees have helped pay for the maintenace and upkeep of parking & launch not to mention cottager cleanups from time to time. This happens on my lake although I have no problem with fishermen fishing my dock & others although more bass boats are showing up on the lake since the LMB  moved into the lake about ten years ago so probably only a matter of time till dock visitors start to show up..........
492751,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-08-09 02:19:00,0," Exactly.  They talk about rude fishermen?  I once was fishing this shoreline. I see these people talking, and they hop in a boat and start flying by on jet skies. I leave. They get off the water. I come back? I see them AGAIN come out with the jet skies. I leave. They get off the water. I go back and AGAIN they come out and start their crap. This was on the trent river too and they made big wakes, so you were pretty much stuck where ever you go.  What do you do? Cast at them like one of the cottage owners suggested?  Threaten them and get charged?  Unfortunately they have the right to be the idiots that they are. And if these cottage owners have the right to ruin my fishing, I have the right to fish their docks!"

If the dock wasn't there the fish would find NATURAL structure in the lake.  Actually if someone parked in front of your house before dark and blasted music. You couldn't say squat. Unless he was on your property.  The cottage owner has absolutely no upper hand in regards to access to our water ways."

492070,ctranter,2010-08-06 21:12:00,543,"I have a cottage on an off-the- grid lake.  Every year I commit countless hours to cleaning up after negligent fisherman.  Heres some of the highlights:  - endless broken glass, much of it taken out of my feet - A full trailor of garbage every season from campers who use my lake for fishing - chemical waste - Crudely made toilets.  I don't enjoy cleaning up human feces but after getting the water tested it has been proven to make its way into the water -  tons of other stuff too.  Therefore, yes, i certainty do OWN my lake, 100 acres of waterfront and unofficially the water within it.  If you have a problem with that, there are plenty of other lakes to fish.  I know most of the regular campers/fisherman, and I routinely share beers with them.  The rest, I drive my boat right next to, and greet them, with the warning that if they leave garbage behind, there will be consequences."

492073,northshore,2010-08-06 21:22:00,13,"Ok speaking as a weekend warrior, who fishes through all the water skiers, seados, wake boarders, power boats, hooplas and yahoos, fishing when the lakes are busiest, the docks are a problem. Generally if i see people on a dock, around the dock, swimming or just hanging out, I always skip it - if the owners are sitting on the porch and the dock looks quiet - i fish it - if boats are tied at the dock, I will make sure not to hit or cast right at the boats (3 feet away at closest) - if i suspect a cast has even a slight chance of going a stray - I won't make the cast - i've never hooked a dock or boat - if the dock is completely empty no boats i may bump the dock or try to skip under it. Yes, i am missing some fish that may be deep under the dock, but that's life, there are other fish to catch. About tourney anglers, being allowed to whip thier lures at any dock they please - don't agree, what gives them the right over recreational anglers to fish docks so closely as to intrude on other people's space. This battle between fishermen and cottage owners has been going on for years and just gets worst as the lakes get busier. There is no resolution to this - just one - use common sense, be polite, and fish with respect for others. If everyone just learns to share the lake and respect each others spaces, we can all have a great day. I don't mind the water skiers, just don't fly by 10 ft from me, i'm not impressed by your skills, only a nickle bass busting the surface can impress me..  And for all those so called ""aggressive"" anglers who cast at ppls boats and hook docks and swimming platforms, not cool, we don't need the added negativity towards us anglers, we're just trying to enjoy the lake like everyone else."
492098,aplumma,2010-08-06 22:29:00,6896,Until the cottage owners that feel they own the lake and the fishermen that feel they own the lake are both banned from the lake it will always be the same argument. I am on both sides of this story the slip that my 28ft boat lives in is owned with a deed same as your house and I have had lures bounced off the boat with paint damage and stranded lures left in the lines. I have had different reactions from the fisherman from dang I lost my lure to can I make this right with you. I have also been the fisherman who has fished a dock and left a lure behind or hit a boat with a lure. At that point it becomes a prospective thing in 5 minutes will it make a difference in my life? If I say anything will it change the outcome? If the answer is YES then go ahead and say something but make sure your motive is positive and not something you say because you decided to spearhead the campaign to be the self elected spokesman( I.E. an asshat) for either side. Most of the time the answer is NO so let it lay... your blood pressure will lower alot quicker if you don't escalate the situation past the point of common sense. You also have to keep in mind that people get killed for just flipping the bird in traffic to the wrong person. The same could happen between the cottager and the fisherman after all life is to short...to intentionally aggravate yourself.  Art
492105,cram,2010-08-06 22:48:00,1733,"I'm pretty sure most of us who own cottages don't fish docks.  We know how irritating it can be from the other perspective.  I also agree its the few who ruin it for everyone else.  Craig (i think) has it right....you're sitting on your dock having a cup of coffee and there are lures bouncing off your feet. Makes no sense to me. I've had people come trolling by while swimming (even did a cannonball off the dock and managed to splash the people in their boat).  To me its simple - treat the dock with the same respect as you would a boat in the middle of the lake.  I know i wouldn't pull up beside a boat in the middle of the lake and start casting around it.  To me its exactly the same thing.  May be different on my lake - 10 miles long, a mile across, and 2/3 uninhabited (probably 80% where my cottage is).......so to me it seems ridiculous that someone needs to fish my dock.  And charlesn.....that would work in concept....but can't we have both happy fishermen and happy cottagers? Why is your happiness more important than theirs?"

I wonder whose taxes pay for the ramp you use and the maintenance involved for that ramp when you drive three hours each way. Don't get me wrong here, I understand why guys fish docks. Lets just show a little bit of courtesy, if it is being enjoyed by someone else, and move on to the next piece of structure.  Tom."
492150,Marko,2010-08-07 00:56:00,854,"If there are people or kids swimming around, no matter whether if its in front of their cottages or anywhere else fisherman should not be fishing around them no matter how great the fishing can be. I am not sure whats so hard to understand about that. I dont care how many fish may be under that dock but if there are people around or pets or whatever just stay away. If nobody is around then its a different story. I dont know how many times i`ll be fishing from shore and see a kayak coming through and every time i pull mine line out. Last thing i`d want to do is hurt somebody, after all its only fishing."

492202,fish_fishburn,2010-08-07 03:39:00,1311,"I love fishing docks. I usually skip tubes most of the time. I have got snagged on ropes and docks but never boats. I feel its my duty to retreive my hook when snagged and have no problem getting out of my boat to do this, whatever it takes to get my tube back. If the dock is being used or people are swimming I just move on to the next one. I remember fishing a dock one time and the couple were in their cottage watching me out the window. I got a tap and set the hook and the fight was on.  Well they came running down to the dock and all I could think was oh oh here we go. Well They watched me land the fish and were all excited and wanted to know what I was using and how did I know there was a big fish under the dock. The miss's went and got her camera and took a pic of me holding a nice 5 lb smallie. We had a nice chat and I gave the guy a few tubes to try out. As we parted the dude says to me thanks for the clinic and the tubes son. So  it was a good encounter. I guess maybe us folks up her in the valley think a little different, maybe were not as stressed out as the city folks. I was raised to treat people like you want to be treated and rarely have any issues arise while out fishing or in daily life."

492385,fish-miester,2010-08-08 01:48:00,864," been there many times. and maybe its just me but it can somtimes feel rewarding.. after a long day of fishing and dealing with speed boats, boat problems, and grumpy cottage owners that freak out on you before you even get to there dock! it can be nice to talk to a cottage owner about whats workin. or if you catch a bass under there dock etc. I remember last year i was fishing an empty dock while the dock a cast away there was a father and son on it fishing. i made one flip under the dock and pulled in a 3lb largie, the kid was so excited and the father was even impressed. the kid was asking to see it etc so i pulled over and showed them. the father told me that i just made the kids day as 5 minutes before the kid was saying how much he hated fishing. and well if I can make that little kids day by showing him a fish thats awesome and hopefully he still likes fishing. i then started talking to them and gave them a few plastics that had been working for me that day and showed them how to rig them. the father wanted to give me $5 for it but i refused and told him that hes gunna need it after he finds out how well they work. he thanked me and off I went. (ps I let the bass go under there dock, hopefully for the kid to catch another day if not someone else)  not all cottage owners are Jack's and and not all dock anglers are pro's. but the best thing you can do is respect each other."

492400,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-08-08 02:24:00,0,"I fish docks from time to time, and have had a few encounters with some cottagers. If they ask politely? I always leave, but if they are rude? I stick around. They can huff and puff till the cows come home.  I never fish a dock if there are kids, adults, animals or anything swimming. Thats just stupid. If I'm covering a row of docks, I will approach every one unless I get a few dirty looks or someone tells me to leave.lol  I try to be very careful not to get snagged. And alot of times I do. 98% of the time I get it out, but sometimes I cant do it, so I kinda understand where SOME of these cottagers are coming from. There are kids swimming near these docks. I also have never damaged a boat but I have wrapped my lure around boat rails and such in the past in windy conditions. And I mean casting from shore at a marina. I dont cast anywhere near boats anymore unless I'm pitching from in close.I respect other people's property.  Now the docks? The dock's are a PRIVILEGE of the owners. They do not own the water or the water under the dock. No mater how much they want to believe they do. The dock is put their for their convenience. Maybe all docks should be forbidden and the locals can use the local boat ramp like everyone else!  The thing is how do we continue to keep fishing docks without endangering children's safety? Do we forbid docks? Do we have designated areas for swimming in every lake(a non-fishing zone)?  I'm curious to see the numbers on how many kids get hooked by snagged hooks in their lake. I would imagine there are a number of hooks in and around most docks.Especially if they are rocky."

492487,aplumma,2010-08-08 13:58:00,6896," At no point in my post did I say littering is acceptable.  The statement however does lead me to share with you a little insight that might be the key that escapes you.  I am pointing out a flaw in your basic logic that is undermining your attempts to have a positive outcome. If I walk into a new bar and say ""no one look at the scar on my face"" 100% of the people will look and remember I am the man with a scar on my face. If I walk into the same bar and tell the funniest joke in the world they will remember I am a man who has good jokes. Both of them are tags that people have given me one is positive and is pleasing to all, the other one is irritating to me and offensive to them. I took the time to read your previous posts and they all have undertones that are less than desirable. They rub against the fabric of the forum and project a confrontational attitude that adds little but excites emotions, mostly negative either towards you or the subject matter.  This is not an attempt to judge or to criticize you because I have not lived your life this is an outside view of what you are showing the world in this forum. Past people who have gone down this path are rarely here for long....  P.M.'s are welcome if you want to discuss the positive aspects of this forum  Art"
492488,alexcba,2010-08-08 14:00:00,634,one thing i didn't point out in my previous post. if i see a white buoy marker near shore i do not launch a hook anywhere near it. i have been to alot of places that have these set up for swim area's. they are usually located to the side a little ways away from the dock it self tho.

Re:  Fishing Docks  As far as I see it, you can fish all the docks you want to fish.  Here's where I won't personally fish a dock:  1)  I won't fish a dock when people or pets are in the area - not for fear of their yipping, for common respect purposes  2)  I won't fish a dock if there are children's toys scattered in the general area.  3)  I won't fish a dock if it is surrounded by docked watercraft.  4)  I won't fish a dock if it is in proximity to a roped off swimming area or floating raft.  5)  If you fish roped off swimming areas, you're a donkey.

491991,steverowbotham,2010-08-06 17:23:00,1800," I'm not one to call people out, but that is Bull.  I fish a minimum 150 days a year, and I love fishing boat docks.  I would consider myself very skilled in fishing them and avoiding snags etc, but I, along with everyone who has spent anytime fishing docks still snag up on the odd one.  It happens, but I always make sure to retrieve my bait.  If you've spent any time fishing docks, I dont believe that you havent hooked one lol.  I will continue to fish docks because seasonally, they offer tremendous fishing opportunities.  I have won tournaments off of a single dock.  That being said, I ALWAYS avoid fishing docks when people are on them or there are people swimming nearby, a quick detour out and around shouldnt be an issue for anyone.  If people politely ask me to steer clear, I generally will.  When people come out cursing and throwing things, they get the same treatment.  Just the same as when I'm out in the middle of the lake and the same people on their jetskis come and do circles within casting distance.  It's a fine line, we all have to deal with it. Just my 2 cents"
491995,alexcba,2010-08-06 17:32:00,634,"i guess im lucky? lol seriously tho, never snagged up. i've snagged lots of shore line tree's but not docks.. i leave that to my buddy vince lol."
491997,whynotalen,2010-08-06 17:42:00,33,"The problem is that cottagers think that they are on another planet when they go to their cottage. They do not want to see or hear anybody. They think that just cause they bought a little house on the lake that they are re-living the pioneer days of being the only person around in miles.  The lake is public property and the dock is on public property so if I would liek to fish there then it i smy right.  However, I do agree with all of you that say that it is pretty ignorant and just simply stupid to fish where there are kids or pets. But, we all know that the notion of comon sense seems to be disappearing.  Maybe we can get the MNR to build random docks around the lake for us fisherman....we do pay a little fee after-all."

In fact I haven't met a single torunament angler that hasn't or doesn't flip or skip docks. I have never had anyone shoo me away. In fact if someone is on the property or it looks like someone is home we just skip it. I have even had a guy come out as we were passing his dock as he was on the lawn with some friends and shout ""hey there is a big one under the dock give it a try"" If your friendly, considerate and careful  don't see you ever running into a problem and if you do just float away. bad common sense gets everyone in hot water no matter what the sport or activity.

I know if it was my dock having all the fish taken off of it I'd keep them at bay or make them move off. Either that or pull out the Musky casting rod and start practicing.

I find it interesting that most of the people that like to fish docks think cottage/home owners should be considerate of their desire to fish the docks but they don't think they should be considerate of the owners right to enjoy a little privicy. Perhaps some of the people fishing the docks should own a place on the water for a while and get to experience some of the    we do have to put up with at times.

492065,craigdritchie,2010-08-06 20:54:00,1586,"A friend of mine has a cottage in the Kawarthas. Each Saturday morning during the summer, anywhere from four to 10 boats will come along and fish his dock. Same deal on Sunday. You can be standing right there with a coffee in your hand and guys will still not even think twice about bouncing tube jigs and Senkos right off your feet. It's even worse when there's a tournament. With respect to Bill M's comment about not casting around swimming kids and all, it's unfortunate that not all anglers feel the same way.  I always thought it was just the cottagers who were dickheads, until I experienced it from the other end of the dock. Now, I completely understand why they get so bent out of shape.  I find it interesting to read through this thread. Docks are a non-issue for me, because I very seldom fish them anymore. Why? EVERYONE fishes docks, and I think for a lot of guys, it's probably the only pattern they know. Personally, I find I catch a lot more fish by focusing on other areas that no one else bothers with."
492067,Big Cliff,2010-08-06 21:03:00,6899," LOL, you can come fish my dock any time you want, I never have a problem with people that respect the rights of others. In fact most OFNr's know that if they ever need a port in a storm, a place for a pit stop, or just about anything else, they can come tie up to our dock anytime!

So I do get out my rod and cast right back stopping the lure a foot or 2 away from the boat.  All they are going to catch around my dock is tiny rockbass anyway so this is why I have to agree with the quote.  Isn't the point of fishing to have fun, relax and try new things?  I haven't even used my old ""standby"" pattern/method from last year as I'm having fun trying new things this year."
492069,charlesn,2010-08-06 21:10:00,551,"Here is a solution I've never seen offered but has ZERO downside to both parties other than some minor inconvenience and carries many benefits for the lake/waterbody as a natural resource:  REMOVE ALL PRIVATE AND PERSONAL DOCKS FROM ALL PUBLIC LAKES.  1) No more obstructions on our public lakes to draw the fish away from other forms of cover and structure. 2) No more confrontations between anglers and cottagers- total kumbaya and peace for all. 3) A nice clean pristine shoreline for all to enjoy and an end to the disruption and destruction of prime spawning habitat.  I'd have no problem with that at all and I'd guess the cottagers would consider it a mild inconvenience to lose their dock privileges on OUR lakes to get rid of the bass fishermen.  After all, a dock is really just a parking space for a watercraft, so they'd jsut have to trailer to the ramp like the rest of us - no big deal - heck some of us have to drive 3 hours each way and still do it with a smile.  Anything else (suntanning/reading a book/relaxing in a chair/even fishing) could be easily replaced by a deck on the backyard that comes to the waterline and is fully contained within their property.  Of course then the cottage owner wouldnt be artificially extending their property out on to OUR lake now would they.  Ah, still, a small small price to pay to get your privacy back, right?  I wonder how that idea would fly with cottagers?"

491915,Harrison,2010-08-06 13:46:00,2202," I couldn't imagine, thats why if you do snag something you ALWAYS get it, 100% of the time.  As in public parking lots, when you ding a car some people will leave a note or track the owner down, others take off.  Boats and docks are on public water, I think the same etiquette applies IMO."
491917,BillM,2010-08-06 13:50:00,17367," I didn't realize cottage owners owned the water around their docks.  I must have missed that memo.  I pitch around docks all the time, I rarely pitch towards someones boat if it's tied up though.  Just be a bit more careful and there are no issues, I'd never fish someones dock if there were people on it though."
491921,Gregoire,2010-08-06 13:55:00,1397,"Should we not have a fisherman's code about this. Maybe something like you shouldn't fish docks if there are people out on them. If you want to fish docks they should be fished early in the morning or during the week when cottagers are less likely to be present. Even though the dock is in the lake it is private property. In fact it can be a very expensive investment. My father in law just spent over 8 grand on his new dock. I could see why he would be upset if someone would damage it. Dannyboy I'm afraid you have it right here. If anglers are reckless around docks and boats the laws will change. Harrison, your attitude is what will get the laws changed. What is wrong with making your way to another spot if a homeowner/dock owner asks you to? In my mind it comes down respecting peoples property. Unless you are a professional fisherman, or in a tournament what is the problem with avoiding fishing a dock or shoreline where there are people present? I would feel uncomfortable fishing a dock when there are people out on their property. However I can see another side to this issue. If I was fishing a dock early in the morning and a person made their way to the dock specifically to yell at me I might want to make them aware of the law. I guess the time of day/week is the big issue for me. Fishing a dock at noon on a weekend when there are clearly people present is asking for trouble IMHO."
491923,g_clot,2010-08-06 13:59:00,104," I truly hope, and dount it'll get the point where the laws are changed.  How often do you hear of injury or civil suits arising from fishing near docks?  As per the article - This is just once side of the story, and I wouldn't doubt the facts are fudged in their favor.  However, hitting someone's boat is completely inappropriate.  However, buying a cottage in the first place naturally results in boaters, fishermen, fires, wildlife etc.  It's a risk they're aware of at the time of purchase.  It's like complaining about someone parking too close to you in a parking lot, or buying a house next to a park and complaining of baseballs going over your fence.  In terms of common courtesy - I've fished by and near docks, sometimes with people there.  In most cases they're pleasant and if they're right on the water we naturally stay further away.  I'm sure if this person simply asked the fishermen mooring 10ft from their dock for more space out of common courtesy in a respectful manner, they'd get the results their looking for."

491925,Harrison,2010-08-06 14:09:00,2202," Attitude?  I think you have the wrong guy.  As for the second part, HUH?"
491926,Gregoire,2010-08-06 14:10:00,1397,"What I'm saying is that fishing is an enjoyable hobby for most of us. It's not a career. If you read my post carefully you would see that I think fishing around docks is quite fine if you respect the cottage owner. However if I was fishing a tournament I would fish the dock. I would also inform any homeowner who had a problem with me that I was in a tournament. If I was out for a day fishing I would have no problem moving along if I as asked to, providing I found the request reasonable, but I would avoid fishing a dock if I thought I was disrupting the homeowner. I would hate to see a change in the law that would prevent fishing docks. I think respect for people, even if you feel like they are not respecting you, is the best approach. Again this is just my opinion. I avoid fishing docks when people are present."

491928,dannyboy,2010-08-06 14:15:00,367,"Cottagers are group of people who the politicians know pay property taxes and, whether right or wrong, feel that by paying those taxes they should receive some benefit, property ownership also includes certain 'rights'.  We as fishermen, on the other hand, pay a relatively small fee compared to property taxes for a license which allows us the 'privilege' of fishing.  Privileges are much easier to take away than rights under law - so who do you think will win in the end? The golden rule says that the ones with the most gold make the rules.  It is the 1% of fishermen that are the problem, just like it was the 1% of boaters that lead to the ridiculous concept of the boaters card.  Dan"
491931,Gregoire,2010-08-06 14:19:00,1397, I just have an opinion about what is right and wrong. If I'm just out for a day of recreational fishing I could care less about being asked to leave. You do not have to agree with me. That is just my opinion.
491935,torco,2010-08-06 14:24:00,656,Like most things jack-asses on both sides of the equation.  But in the last few years I have run into more cottagers that seem to think they bought a cottage and therefore own 200 nautical miles out from shore.  Best approach is always common sense and courtesy though.
