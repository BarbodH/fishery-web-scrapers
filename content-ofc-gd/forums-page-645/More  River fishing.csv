I observed that I am either horrible at fishing with soft baits (dropshot, tube, senko), or they like only one thing. As soon as i gave up and switched back to what worked they hit right away! This pretty smallie hit as soon as my lure hit the water right after a run right at the head of the calm water. Put up a great fight and i am excited to maybe catch it again!  One observation, When i pulled this Smallie out of the water, it was a light light green, and as i watched, it changed color to these stripes that we normally see on smallies. Really cool!  "
493984,BillsTheBassMan,2010-08-13 02:01:00,932,Nice report Tyler and nice fish!  We'll get into a few of those next week and we'll do our best to get you a new PB!
493986,tybrad,2010-08-13 02:02:00,45,sounds like a plan.  Any reasoning as to why these change color so rapidly? is it normal?
493990,jediangler,2010-08-13 02:07:00,1923,Nice one Tybrad. It's stress that makes them change colour. Just means it's time to get them back in the water. Bluegills do this even more drastically. They start with a yellow belly that turns a dark orange grey after you have them out of the water for 10 seconds.
