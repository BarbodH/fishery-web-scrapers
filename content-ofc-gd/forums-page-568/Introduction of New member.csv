558090,RoyF,2011-03-04 21:35:00,12,"Hello everyone,  Just wanted to take the time to introduce myself. I am a 38 year old Noobie to fishing. I started fishing again late last year for the first time in over 20 some odd years. The one thing I have discovered it that fishing is SO relaxing. I am slowing finding places to shore fish, bu I usually go to Kars Ont. on the old pier. All last year all my son and I managed to catch are small perch, and 1 really small small mouth bass from the Lock on Prince of wales drive. in Ottawa.  So if you have great tips you want to share please feel free to send a quick message. May this yar be better for us fishing.  Roy"
