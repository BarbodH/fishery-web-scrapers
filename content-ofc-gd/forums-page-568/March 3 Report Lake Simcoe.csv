The weather for the rest of the weekend looks sketchy at best and I think a lot of the access points are going to take a hit with the runoff, but only time will tell, definitely exercise caution out there this weekend! Tuesday we were out and managed to get into some fish.  There was a lot of blank screen for sure, but we put a bunch of fish on the ice, mostly in the smaller range but a few good ones.  Spoons caught most of our fish on Tuesday. Today I had a client out and the fishing was hot at times and COLD at others.  The active fish came through here and there and we put a bunch more fish on the ice, always great to do that.  Fishing in the 80-90 foot range both days.         "

557782,douG,2011-03-04 02:46:00,2693,"Some very fat lakers, Steve.  They look well fed, almost like browns, with small heads and football bodies.  Excellent fish.  Does this speak to the herring rebound on Simcoe?"
