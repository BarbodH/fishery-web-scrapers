The house directly in the background was built by my Grandfather more than 40 years ago. When he passed away my Grandma had to move closer to town but we still hold a lot of great memories at this place.  We started in 20 feet of water and moved in shallow to 5 feet where we started getting some action in the thick greenery. Historically we used to catch tons of decent size pike, the odd monster and once a 15lbs walleye! This time the small rockets came out to play. We brought in two and missed three, including one big one. The misses were my fault, as I've been locked in walleye mode using smaller hooks and no leaders. Two of the lines we properly set up, but the other two were not.  This was a last minute trip so I get what I deserve.  Highlight of the day: A nice, just under the slot walleye took my 4inch smelt-like spoon in 5 feet of water. Check out the yellow colors    Redneck fish finder        ...here comes the snow      Thanks for looking!"
