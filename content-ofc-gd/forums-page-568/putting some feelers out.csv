557720,kickingfrog,2011-03-04 01:40:00,8333,My brother is looking for a float rod. Figure maybe 12-13 foot 2 piece. Barrie area.  Lots of subjective elements that only he can decide in the end but I thought I'd check here.
557722,BillM,2011-03-04 01:41:00,17367,He should probably check the Floatboard as well if he's looking for some used gear.
557723,landry,2011-03-04 01:44:00,1005,Don't buy a noodly one!!! Check out mudhole.com - their mhx rods are AMAZING and they are knock-offs of loomis imx blanks. I have built a smallie model and it was amazing and super light / fast action - will be ordering more. They have a 13' version - clone to the imx 1562. I bet it is awesome. AND - they are VERY reasonable. Landry

557744,MJL,2011-03-04 02:03:00,2427,Any idea of how much he wants to spend on one?
557754,kickingfrog,2011-03-04 02:12:00,8333,"$200 neighbourhood maybe, but really depends on the rod and the condition."
557757,GBW,2011-03-04 02:14:00,8460,Rod $ only or rod/reel price @ $200?
557762,kickingfrog,2011-03-04 02:22:00,8333,He has a couple of new ones in mind. I'm just checking for some used options to get a little more rod for less money.
557779,BillM,2011-03-04 02:44:00,17367,New line of St.Croix's have had a lot of people talking.  Great price as well.
557802,kickingfrog,2011-03-04 03:03:00,8333, Avid?
557815,BillM,2011-03-04 03:27:00,17367,Yup.
558200,kickingfrog,2011-03-05 01:17:00,8333,ttt
558217,MJL,2011-03-05 01:44:00,2427,In that price range neighbourhood and 12-13ft 2pc configuration some that come to mind are: - 13’ Raven IM8 ($200) - 13’ St Croix Avid ($280 new at most places for the newest model) - 13’ St Croix Wild river (Under $200) - 13’ Streamside (Around $120) - 13’ 2pc Frontier (You get no form of warranty with it though) – Usually $150 new in shops now when you can find them - 13’ Loomis GL2 (usually you can find them used for around $200-$250 in the classifieds – Like the Frontier I don’t think you’d get warranty with the GL2 nowadays)
558225,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-03-05 01:57:00,0,Steer clear of okuma and you're golden!
558256,kingofthesteelhead,2011-03-05 04:37:00,140,Have a 13 ft St Croix and a 13 ft Browning Six Rivers which was a lot less and to me is a better rod.Got the Browning at Bass Pro in Vaughn for a little more than 100.
558331,TDunn,2011-03-05 14:36:00,680,I would check out the Raven IM8 forsure! I own a 12'6 Raven Matrix and for the money I paid for it. No complaints. I think it was $149.99 at the time and has landed me enough fish to get my $150 worth. I'm about to order the IM9 or RV9 and a new SST-3 myself! Can't wait!  TDunn
558341,solopaddler,2011-03-05 14:51:00,8605,A buddy is selling a custom 14' Raven IM8 built to the nines. I originally built it for myself at a cost of $600.  It could probably be had for $300.
558344,Garry2Rs,2011-03-05 15:00:00,1425,"I have a two piece 11'6"" G.Loomis Frontier float rod.  It is almost new, only used one Spring...I no longer have a reel for it and would consider any serious offer."
558345,kickingfrog,2011-03-05 15:02:00,8333, That comes with a flight for two to visit you down south right Garry?
558351,kickingfrog,2011-03-05 15:10:00,8333,"Thanks for all of the responses guys. I've been passing them all on to my brother. I think he wants to poke around the sportsman show to get his mitts on a few first. He is not new to pinning, he's just looking to get another rod."
