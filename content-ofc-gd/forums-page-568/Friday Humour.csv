He asked his wife, Mary, if she would go to the hardware store and pick up a hinge. Mary agreed to go. While she was waiting for the nice  young man to finish serving a customer, her eye caught a beautiful bathroom vanity faucet set. When the man finished with the other customer, Mary asked him, ""How much is that vanity set?"" The young assistant manager replied, ""That's a gold plated set and the price is $900.00."" ""My goodness,"" Mary exclaimed, ""that is very expensive. It's certainly out of my price bracket."" She then proceeded to describe the hinge that Charlie had sent her to buy. The manager said that he had them in stock and went into the storeroom to get one. From the storeroom he yelled, ""Lady, do you wanna screw fo the hinge?"" Mary paused for a moment and then shouted back, ""No, but I will for the vanity set.""  This is why you should never send a woman to the hardware store!"
