557218,Handlebarz,2011-03-02 19:48:00,3790,I love my Cannon Cameras they have been nothing but AAA++++ for me over the years I love them and will always buy them I have tried Kodak but that was a joke and Fuji was also a joke for us.  The one I am using now is the Power Shot SD1300 IS if there was one thing I would change it would be the self timer I would like it to have 10 shots like my old A Shot 550.

557270,Billy Bob,2011-03-02 21:40:00,5865,After buying/trying several over the years the Nikon-S570 is hands down the best I have used especially with it's lithium ion battery.

557314,FrankTheRabbit,2011-03-02 23:06:00,479,"Picked up the Nikon S8100 around Xmas time for $280 taxes in.  Great auto modes, fits in my pocket, records in 1080p stereo, good quality photos, and quick all around.  Very seldom do I need to toy around with the settings to get an acceptable shot. Perfect for fishing. I was very tempted in getting the SD1400s too, but the 1080p recording won me over."

557565,FishTracker,2011-03-03 18:36:00,47,"Big Canon fan - using an old Rebel XT dSLR - be sure to invest in some quality lenses though.  For P & S, currently using a Panasonic TS2 - waterproof (for those nice underwater shots - and HD video), freezeproof, and shockproof (lots of rocks along the river) - a great camera when it comes to durability.  Low light (noise reduction) is not the greatest and would suggest a Canon product like the D10."
