The night fishing can be amazing. There is a bridge only 5 mins from the hotel just walking or you can get one of the porters to take you over by cart or take it yourself. You can catch Snook. Tarpon. Jack, cubera snapper which get huge and taste fantastic and permit. Shallow running baits are what you need. You'll be casting into the current and letting all the line you have on your reel out with it. A nice long retrieve with pauses as you reel. The fish just smash your baits. A couple Snapper and you need another bait. Take your Musky casting rod and maybe one smaller set up. The off shore fishing can be ok as well. Try bottom fishing and make sure they take you way off shore to do some trolling/ deep sea fishing or all you will catch will be Cuda. King fish and Wahoo are common as well as dolphin. It doesnt get any hype because there are no Americans around to do that...lol That will change one day.  PM me if you want more info..."
