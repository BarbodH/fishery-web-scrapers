557567,GBW,2011-03-03 18:40:00,8460,now why did you have to drag skeeter into this...  wait for it.... . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 
557569,ehg,2011-03-03 18:41:00,2666,This is the bottom line. Imitation frogs are cheaper overall and allow you more control over presentation.  Catching a bucket of leopard frogs was a great childhood memory but is just that. I am not into watching them use their little hands struggling to get unhooked when an imitation might be better.  Having a heart is maybe more effective than trying to be a 'traditional' tough guy.

557763,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-03-04 02:30:00,1107, I rig them on a weighted wide gap worm hook and fish them in the holes in the weeds all the time the gulp frogs would be awesome I have been using yum toads  no live bait for me for anything except the odd perch trip on Erie
557472,MCTFisher9120,2011-03-03 14:24:00,3761,"I can see your point some but frogs barely get used anymore except for the rowboat ""locals"" i see time and time again...get real fella's...I hate to see what people think of hunting let alone stupid frogs.  I think it's time to put this topic to rest."
557474,cram,2011-03-03 14:32:00,1733, Cool the jets.  Said I used them.  Just pointed out its different.
557475,Harrison,2011-03-03 14:48:00,2202, Not sure where you get your info from Mike.  I am not a row boat local and use frogs all the time.  As do many of my friends. They are a great way to locate finicky bass and catch walleye in the fall.
557478,cram,2011-03-03 14:54:00,1733,btw - I don't like Italo either.  Not sure how/why that show is still on.

557487,Harrison,2011-03-03 15:07:00,2202, Is it possible to have a meeting with one person in attendance?
557488,MCTFisher9120,2011-03-03 15:08:00,3761," Not sure if you read my above posts...there is nothing wrong with using frogs...i used them for years and still have family that uses them...by ""locals"" where I fish every summer for 2-4 weeks the locals that i see time and time again still use them and i dont have anything bad to say about it...kinda miss using them but for me it's too easy to catch bass with a real frog...so I stopped using live bait(soft water) and haven't looked back as I like a challenge when fishing.  The show is alright sometimes but my dad always call's him ""mr boring haha""...instant channel change most times but I've watch a few of his live bait segments. To say there are slightly wrong for showing kids how to hook up live bait is stupid and to be honest, be thankful that a hand ful of young ones are fishing and watching fishing shows.  But hey, everybody has something to say. In this world the younger kids are better off using a frog and catching bass young as I did."
557490,MCTFisher9120,2011-03-03 15:10:00,3761,PAIN IS A PSYCHOLOGICAL EXPERIENCE THAT IS SEPARATE FROM BEHAVIORAL REACTIONS TO INJURIOUS STIMULI  Or you can flick them in the head before you hook them like I remember doing...there you go all the research doesn't apply to frog fishing now.

557508,Mike01,2011-03-03 15:55:00,378,"I honestly can't stand the show, or Italo.  He is an arrogant, patronizing idiot and I don't care if I've offended anyone by saying it.  On the subject of frogs as bait:  I used them sometimes as bait when I was younger and would never once hesitate in letting my boys use them either.  If your worried about torturing animals, you shouldn't be fishing.  With that said I always do my best to put the least amount of stress possible on bait and the fish that I catch with them."
557513,perchslayer666,2011-03-03 16:01:00,280,"Never personally had any sucess when using live frogs (1-2 frogs lifetime) but I hear they work great for buckets and Pike... I don't think we need to use them anymore since lure manufacturers are making frog lures look better than the real thing, but hey if it's part of a tradition, or childhood memories, then go for it.  I'd rather leave them alone as they are a  good indicator of environmental health in some areas, and they eat bugs of all different types."
557527,Shaun Rickard,2011-03-03 16:40:00,144, Well said

557538,Harrison,2011-03-03 17:30:00,2202," Now your thinking Mike!  As for Canadian Sportfishing, they were #1 back in the day in Canada.  No Doubt about it. TV, Mags, contests etc... but times change as with all things in life."

557555,LeXXington,2011-03-03 18:10:00,1928,Wish my kids had the chance to go down to the local creek and catch froggies.  Ahhh memeories. I may not use them as there is lots of replica baits out now but if you like that type of fishing go for it.  Canadian Sportfishing ~ At least it's from Canada
557556,Lunker Larry,2011-03-03 18:11:00,122,"Used to use frogs all the time for large mouth. My kids would get buckets full at White Lake here in Ottawa. Toss them into any dark shadow along the bank and hold on. But with their numbers appearing to drop and the advance of plastics, I can't see sacrificing a frog for a fish I'm going to let go. Modern day imitations are the way to go."
557560,darsky,2011-03-03 18:19:00,586,"I am not against using frogs as bait-it is just how the segment was presented. I just dont think little girls/kids should be present when hooking a frog. I can see my 6 yr old boy asking me "" doesn't that hurt the frog Daddy ? """

557143,darsky,2011-03-02 17:01:00,586,"Was watching Italo the other day and up came the ""fishing in your own backyard"" segment with a cute little girl with her pink FISHER GIRL tshirt on. He was talking about using frogs as bait. Goes on to explain how to rig the frog. Single hook through the lip he says. Then he shows a different method by actually hooking the frog through the leg and tosses it out to the lake with the girl looking on. Now this is my opinion only but I think the whole thing was a little morbid. Little boys and girls should play with frogs and not hook them through the chin or leg. I think he or the shows producers should have shown better judgment."
557146,danbouck,2011-03-02 17:04:00,4380,Not much of a difference than putting a hook in a minnow or worm

Too many kids these days think that fish come from a box in the freezer section at the grocery store.  More people need to understand the ecological connection the environment has to our food sources."
557162,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-03-02 17:42:00,0,i think your first mistake was watching canadian sportfishing.
557164,DoubleDigits,2011-03-02 17:53:00,140,The fishergirl segment is the only part of the show where Italo's patronizing tone is not misplaced.

557227,Lunkerhunter,2011-03-02 20:19:00,455,how about how he releases the fish. nothing drives me more crazy on tv than watching a fish float upside down in his net as he says how this is the right way to release a fish. lol

557258,MJL,2011-03-02 21:24:00,2427,Kermit? NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!  Personally I've never used them...Watching other people hook them kinda grosses me out.

I always rathered a bag of frog's than a dozen minnows or worms...back then we could buy them and catching them was simple in the right location....The fishergirl parts on his show are alright, they show the kids some good stuff..."
557276,MCTFisher9120,2011-03-02 21:47:00,3761,And as a side note they are the best thing to use for buckets....mark my words on that 1...if it wasn't soo easy then I would still be using them with that great eagle claw weedless hook in the duck weed.....ooooo baby..old times
557285,Ron,2011-03-02 22:01:00,1683,  I'll echo that statement. This guy should have lost his fishing privileges for life.That goes for Henry as well.
557293,cram,2011-03-02 22:10:00,1733,"I used to use frogs all the time.  They definitely work, but watching them struggle to pull the hook out of their lips is terrible.  I disagree about them being similar to worms (hardly has a brain) and minnows (no sense of sentient pain).  Frogs are far more complex."
557305,solopaddler,2011-03-02 22:43:00,8605,"Some of my best memories as a child come from spending hours catching leopard frogs for bait.  Well, that and crayfish.  That was always a big part of our annual trip up north to the cottage.  I think I had more fun catching them, and boy did they work.  I'm hoping to show the art of catching and fishing frogs both of my kids. (if my back can take it  ).  As far as Italo goes, I don't have much use for him or his show."
557307,GBW,2011-03-02 22:51:00,8460,I haven't fished with a real frog in 2 decades.  rather use a snake...
557393,ehg,2011-03-03 02:45:00,2666,I agree! It shows how perceptions have changed over the last 30 yrs. or so. Used to be able to buy them at bait shops. Not sure if they are still available. Caught a lot of  bass with father as a kid using them.  There surely is a difference between frogs and worms. Worms don't try to pull hook out with their little hands. Frogs are an excellent bait though.  Italo etc... should have used better judgment.

557457,mattybculp,2011-03-03 13:33:00,388,"Thats funny because from the age of 9 to the time when you couldnt get them anymore i had always used frogs. The crazy thing is that i liked to play with them and thought it was a blast to go out and catch em, but make no mistake i didnt hesitate putting them on the hook. Is there anything better for large mouth. Who needs italo to show you anyway, my grandmother of 82 showed me how to put em on the hook. If i were heading up to the cottage on north baptiste she would always phone me up before i left and say "" hey can you pick me up 6 dozen frogs at stones on your way up "" The good ole days. Shes still around and still loves bass."
557462,JBen,2011-03-03 14:03:00,31,"I sense a little danger in what I'm about to say  ""Showing"" better judgement.... aka editting the show so as to appease those that might get offended at the thought/sight of a frog on a hook is not only the wrong thing to do imo.  Its a little hypocritical..  To Whit. Some are saying/suggesting the show went too far because the poor little frog struggles to free the hook and kids shouldnt see that. Yet it's perfectly ok to bury hooks into fish, (once they take the bait) haul them through slop, or fight them out to near exhaustion in some cases.  Remove said hooks buried in their mouths, give them a tender pat on the back, take a pic , all for no other real reason than our own personal 2 or 10 minutes of gratification. Then release them so someone else can do the same to them tomorrow?  aka we don't want kids or the public to see us torturing frogs, it sends the wrong message but we do want our kids to see/learn how to torture fish so they to can enjoy it  Just food for thought.  /edit add Anyone think this Bow isnt struggling to free the hook?

557470,cram,2011-03-03 14:19:00,1733," Brain and nervous structure is completely different.  Fish don't feel/experience/have-an-emotion from pain the way we do.  Frogs kind of do.  To be clear - i used them all the time, so not saying all you frog-using guys are evil. Just saying its different to hook a  minnow (or musky) and a frog."
