558070,jimmer,2011-03-04 20:47:00,2730,I was hoping that I might get some help from fellow OFNers. My 21 year-old son is going to be starting an apprenticeship in the Maple area shortly and it will be basically his first time living away from home. He needs to find a place to live for $450-$550/month that includes parking and utilities. Please PM me if you know of any places or can offer any suggestions on where to look. Thanks Jimmer
