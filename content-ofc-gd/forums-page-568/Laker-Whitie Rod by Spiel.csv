557581,Spiel,2011-03-03 19:04:00,9065,"Hot Damn! That's a tank Rick! Even better that it still swims and the rod is still in one piece.  Curious though, was it a clipper?"
557587,Nemo,2011-03-03 19:19:00,727,Let's see a pic of the rod. Nice LT BTW.

557626,aplumma,2011-03-03 21:34:00,6896,How come the rod you built me didn't catch fish like that? Never mind I am sure you are just going to say it is my fault.   Art
557635,Joey,2011-03-03 22:12:00,9122,"What a beast!!!!  Way to go, and as stated, specs on rod and fish would be nice"

557953,RickOnt,2011-03-04 16:29:00,669,"The Fish  Not sure if it was clipped!! Obviously the side in the Pic was not!!  I wanted to get Her back in the swim as soon as possible.  Weight I am guessing about the 12lb mark.   The Rod.  I asked Spiel for A Laker/Whitie Ice Rod, about 32"" and Med/Heavy action, Large Eyes and to be used with Spinning Gear,  The Rest I left up to Him!!   The result       Rick"
