557680,mercman,2011-03-04 00:37:00,7054,"Recently i started a silly little thread that, in retrospect, should never have been posted on this forum.At the time,and in my mind, it was intended to lighten the atmosphere a bit on the board. I realize now, that to a potential new member, or a possible new paying sponsor, it could have given a negative image of this community. Not only that, but i now know that it has probably made many of you think that i am a total idiot. Please know that i am not.I may have a misguided sense of humor at times and a very vivid imagination, but i am no idiot. I have been known to suffer from foot in mouth disease on occasion, but that is something i am constatly working to be cured of. If you see me getting that way again, just send me a PM and politely tell me to ""cool it"", i will understand immediately  I sincerely appologize to the members and moderators of OFC who were offended by that thread. I will try not to let a similar situation arise in the future.  Paul"
