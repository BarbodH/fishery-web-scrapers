558071,the spirit of fishing,2011-03-04 20:48:00,141,I just read this in the Toronto Star.  http://www.thestar.c...asian-carp?bn=1
558075,fishing n autograph,2011-03-04 20:57:00,2540,his sentence should be to hop on a seadoo and fly at 95kmph in an area infested by the jumping menace hopefully he'd get hit by one of them suckers
558080,danjang,2011-03-04 21:14:00,148,WOW... This guy has been caught twice doing this? Imagine how many times he had gotten through without being caught.
558081,jimmer,2011-03-04 21:15:00,2730,And how many others are getting through. That's just scarey!!!!!
558108,fishnsled,2011-03-04 22:01:00,3520, That is too good of a sentence for that . He should lose his business after trying that crap for a 2nd time on top of the fines.
558112,perchslayer666,2011-03-04 22:06:00,280,I say we go to his business and throw eggs at his place. That is the LEAST we can do.
558121,tb4me,2011-03-04 22:28:00,3295,"50 grand, althou awesome he should be hung by his toes for that."
558132,splashhopper,2011-03-04 22:49:00,2931,"let's see now...  if we fish(poach) out of season or in sanctuaries we can get fined AND LOSE ALL EQUIPMENT used to commit the offence ( vehicles included)  For a SECOND OFFENCE, he should have lost the truck too"
558151,fishing n autograph,2011-03-04 23:50:00,2540, I can think of a more sensitive thought provoking spot he can be hung from!!!
558154,MCTFisher9120,2011-03-04 23:53:00,3761,"That's amazing that the people that work to prevent this let him get by, why are they even working when things of this savarity can just come across. At least they caught him."
558196,SBCregal,2011-03-05 01:07:00,688,"there is such a huge number of trucks crossing the border crossing each day that they cant possibly check every single vehicle thoroughly, if your paperwork looks in order and you have what you need you normally just get let through.  they do random checks and checks on people who dont have their stuff in order.  at least thats how it was when i was picking up inventory in michigan for my buddys warehouse weekly.  that was a few years back now"
558204,mercman,2011-03-05 01:24:00,7054,"If he paid 40K for the first offence, and did it again, just imagine how much money he has, and will again make when he does it the 3rd time Thats a huge fine for you and i, but it seems like a mere slap on he wrist for this guy. Remove the demand is the only way to stop the crime.I'm pretty sure he wasnt dumping them in the lake and giggling his  off.He was selling them to members of his community who eat them as a delicacy and staple part of their diet."
558249,knightfisher,2011-03-05 03:43:00,237,"If he was that brazen to continue to bring the fish over, could one extrapolate that some of these fish made it to a few local ponds....."
558252,mercman,2011-03-05 03:59:00,7054," Possibly, but highly unlikely. These fish were money to him.Big money.And they were probably already sold or promised to customers."
558263,GoneFishin,2011-03-05 07:08:00,349, But why transport live fish? I guess they might stay fresher.. but I'm sure a cooler would do the job...
558292,MCTFisher9120,2011-03-05 12:37:00,3761," Exactly, everything in todays world revolves around money. All I know is if I did something terribly wrong I would rather debt than jail and anybody would. As others said take away a privilege....like your driving license for life maybe"
558293,Billy Bob,2011-03-05 12:49:00,5865," I seen a report on TV that said as a custom Asians purchase 2 fish, release one and eat one, so this may be why they transported them alive.  With a second offense I would think jail time is in order addition to the 50k fine."
558312,Carp,2011-03-05 13:26:00,1488,I'm all for jail time. Obviously the fines aren't enough to stop this individual.
558316,timmeh,2011-03-05 13:38:00,609,"  Unfortunately you are correct. In some traditions the fish is released alive, so it's fairly safe to assume that some of these fish would have been released. And who knows how many have already have made it through and have been. It's really sad that some people just don't have enough respect for this country and our resources."
