Threw tons on them back for another day.  This is what the 12"" it looked like when i caught it.    This is what they looked like an hour ago...LOL    This is what we did with them......    Deep fried in TJ's special seasoning, with home fries."

I remember when I asked TJ for his ""Secret Family"" coating recipe and he told me that he could tell me but then he'd have to kill me. So I walked away and asked him again 8 whiskeys and a 12 of beer later.... BLAH BLAH BLAH!  Thanks TJ... it's all I ever use anymore. Should be boxed and sold right up there beside Choronzey's !"
