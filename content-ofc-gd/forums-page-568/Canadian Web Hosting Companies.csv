Well I just got an email from them and they have been sold to a US company. I want to keep my $$$ in Canada so am looking for a new hosting/registration company in Canada.  So who are you guys out there using who are Canadian and how is their service. I found a company called Hostpapa.ca also located in Toronto, anyone using their service?"
557298,umKthxbye,2011-03-02 22:20:00,247,"I actually use host papa for my numerous sites. The service is great, prices are great. Although i have my 2nd .ca domain name registered under another company due to their prices being lower. I cant recall the name of the other one. Host papa also just did a big server upgrade recently which really helped with a few minor issues i was having with speed. I got there hosting when they were a small company and the prices were a bit lower. Give them a try i don't think you'll regret it."
557304,fish_finder,2011-03-02 22:37:00,370," On thing I'll say is stay away from webserve.ca.  I dealt with them for a number of years.  The last couple have been an absolute nightmare.  I'm currently in the process of transferring everything away from them.  sentex.ca is a company I've dealt with in the past, and you may want to get in touch with them to see if they can help you out!"
557319,bdox,2011-03-02 23:26:00,329,I've used networx for years. They're now Envision Networks.  http://www.envisionnetworks.ca/
557514,Raf,2011-03-03 16:13:00,3495,i use webnames.ca for the domain but my hosting is south of the border -- better price.
