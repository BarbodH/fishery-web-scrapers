556980,BillM,2011-03-02 02:57:00,17367," If I shave them off, I'll reduce my wind resistance then you won't stand a chance!  lol"
556982,solopaddler,2011-03-02 03:00:00,8605," Now there's an idea! Bill, are you listening?     "
556983,kickingfrog,2011-03-02 03:01:00,8333," Mike zig zag a lot, his equilibrium will be way off."
556989,solopaddler,2011-03-02 03:13:00,8605, Exactly.  Like an antelope running away from an angry cheetah with an inner ear infection.
556993,mercman,2011-03-02 03:19:00,7054, Ear Infection OMG.........................................
556995,danc,2011-03-02 03:20:00,4677,Twin brothers seperated at birth??  
556999,solopaddler,2011-03-02 03:34:00,8605,     Bill's angry uncle Joe:     His depressed cousin Guiseppe back in the home country:     His crazy half cousin Lenny:      It's hereditary

557016,solopaddler,2011-03-02 04:02:00,8605,  But....no one knew you were trying to be funny.
557040,highdrifter,2011-03-02 07:46:00,2534,"Nice juan Bill.  Gotta love that ledge.  We slayed some big dirties last Saturday..  Myself and Buick were just north of you guys!!  cheers  By the way, those brows are inhuman!!"
557052,Familyfisherman,2011-03-02 11:44:00,188,Excellent fish -- love the colours!
557057,Basskicker,2011-03-02 12:15:00,421,You guys are too funny....thanks for giving me my Wednesday morning laugh......almost spit coffee all over the computer
557065,corvette1,2011-03-02 13:02:00,1765,nice browns bill
557066,blaque,2011-03-02 13:20:00,2419,Is that a pet goldfish in your gear bag
557263,BillM,2011-03-02 21:27:00,17367, Pet Berkley Gulp.
557333,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-03-02 23:58:00,1107,Thanks know I have to clean the pepsi off my screen  Nice browns Bill one of my faves to catch
557339,craigdritchie,2011-03-03 00:13:00,1586, OMG that is hysterical!!
557344,solopaddler,2011-03-03 00:20:00,8605,I'm glad some of you guys see the humour.   (I'm hoping Bill won't kill me.  )
557364,lookinforwalleye,2011-03-03 01:22:00,4399,  Thats some funny stuff there!!!
557624,BillM,2011-03-03 21:33:00,17367," Mike, I'm laughing about as hard as these other guys  :)"
557687,aniceguy,2011-03-04 00:43:00,1094,pretty much one of the funniest threads I have read in a while thanks for the chuckle mike
557716,lookinforwalleye,2011-03-04 01:35:00,4399,  Ditto!!!
556880,BillM,2011-03-01 23:55:00,17367,"Seeing that you've taken a liking to these fish, I thought I'd throw a few up I popped on the Niagara on the weekend   "
556882,Jacob,2011-03-01 23:58:00,186,Nice fish  
556883,solopaddler,2011-03-02 00:01:00,8605,"Good gawd man, your eyebrows are gigantic."
556884,douG,2011-03-02 00:02:00,2693,"Those are gorgeous, Bill.  Well done."
556886,BillM,2011-03-02 00:04:00,17367," That's what happens when you start messing around in Photoshop, lol."
556887,solopaddler,2011-03-02 00:04:00,8605, You're talking eyebrows here right Doug?  They are pretty luxurious.
556888,solopaddler,2011-03-02 00:05:00,8605, Looks like a couple of wolverines nesting just above your eyes.   
556889,Roy,2011-03-02 00:06:00,13728,Certainly one of the top 3 glamour freshwater species of North America. Beauties for sure Bill. Thanks a ton for posting. Much appreciated.
556893,darsky,2011-03-02 00:13:00,586,Roy-Massawippi has specimens like that and bigger. Just need to put in some time.......or get lucky.
556895,Roy,2011-03-02 00:17:00,13728,"I find that there's too many people fishing the major Township waters, Darren. Unless of course you have a more obscure location?"
556903,vinnimon,2011-03-02 00:37:00,2593,Nice fish Bill
556906,mercman,2011-03-02 00:44:00,7054,"  oh please Solo, dont get me started, i""m trying to turn over a new leaf  Nice looking Browns"
556919,skeeter,2011-03-02 01:06:00,1907, yes but the old leaf is right under the new leaf !!!
556920,craigdritchie,2011-03-02 01:08:00,1586,Man I've heard of guys using Photoshop to make their fish look bigger .... but never the eyebrows.  Dang ......
556933,Roy,2011-03-02 01:24:00,13728, He's not a book Dann. Quit leafing through him.
556939,MJL,2011-03-02 01:42:00,2427,"Sweet brownies Bill   ...Itching to get down there myself after almost a month of no fishing  As for the eye-brows, consider them assets...You have an infinite amount of dubbing available to tie nymphs on the river when you need them the most!"
556944,solopaddler,2011-03-02 02:04:00,8605, Or you could shear them off and knit a nice warm fluffy pair of socks.
556963,ketchenany,2011-03-02 02:27:00,3229,"They are not! Bill played football and they put that black stuff in the wrong place and he has kept up the tradition! Nice looking fish Bill, solo is jealous. . ."
556968,BillM,2011-03-02 02:32:00,17367," I'm always up for a good ribbing, especially by friends"
556972,solopaddler,2011-03-02 02:37:00,8605, HAHAHA!
556973,solopaddler,2011-03-02 02:41:00,8605,  Solo guided young William to those fine browns.  In fact the big colourful one was caught on my bait right in front of me. After I had drifted the same spot for 30 minutes.   No jealousy here.
556974,lookinforwalleye,2011-03-02 02:43:00,4399,  Eyebrow fetish! good to know.  Note to self shave eyebrows before the Richter trip!!!
556975,BillM,2011-03-02 02:43:00,17367, I won't mention you whining like a little girl about your back all day either  :)
556976,solopaddler,2011-03-02 02:48:00,8605, Yes please.  But only if they currently look like two giant black rabbit strip leaches.  It'd be too distracting trying to take good fish pictures with those bushy monstrosities in the way.
556978,solopaddler,2011-03-02 02:49:00,8605, Yeah well...I can still outrun you and your giant eyebrows and that's all that matters.
