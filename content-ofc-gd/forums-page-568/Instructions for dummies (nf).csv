In case you needed further proof that the human race is doomed through stupidity, here are some actual label instructions on consumer goods.      On a Sears’ hairdryer -- Do not use while sleeping. (That's the only time I have to work on my hair.)    On a bag of Fritos -- You could be a winner! No purchase necessary. Details inside. (the shoplifter special?)   On a bar of Dial soap -- ""Directions : Use like regular soap."" (and that would be?)  On some Swanson frozen dinners -- ""Serving suggestion : Defrost."" (but, it's just a suggestion.)   On Tesco's Tiramisu dessert (printed on bottom) -- ""Do not turn upside down."" (well... duh; a bit late, huh?)   On Marks & Spencer Bread Pudding – ""Product will be hot after heating."" (...and you thought?)   On packaging for a Rowenta iron -- ""Do not iron clothes on body."" (but wouldn't this save me time?)   On Boot's Children Cough Medicine -- ""Do not drive a car or operate machinery after taking this medication."" (We could do a lot to reduce the rate of construction accidents if we could just get those 5 year-olds with head-colds off those bulldozers!)   On Nytol Sleep Aid -- ""Warning : May cause drowsiness."" (and I'm taking this because?)    On most brands of Christmas lights -- ""For indoor or outdoor use only."" (as opposed to what?)   On a Japanese food processor -- ""Not to be used for the other use."" (Now, somebody out there, help me on this. I'm a bit curious.)    On Sainsbury's peanuts -- ""Warning : contains nuts."" (talk about a news flash!)   On an American Airlines packet of nuts -- ""Instructions : Open packet, eat nuts."" (Step 3 : say what?)   On a child's Superman costume -- ""Wearing of this garment does not enable you to fly."" (I don't blame the company. I blame the parents for this one.)   On a Swedish chainsaw -- ""Do not attempt to stop chain with your hands or genitals."" (Oh my God.. was there a lot of this Happening somewhere?)    Now that you've smiled at least once, it's your turn to spread the stuupidity ."
