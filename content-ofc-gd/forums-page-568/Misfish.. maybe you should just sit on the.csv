558328,Big Cliff,2011-03-05 14:26:00,6899," I don't know if that would help him, with his luck he'd probably fire the slug at the turkey, the bird shot at the deer, just as the CO walked around the corner LOL."
558340,SmokestackLightnin,2011-03-05 14:50:00,390, They know exactly what time of year it is.  I have 2 flocks that come to my bird feeders every day now.  They show up every year once the snow crusts in February and usually stick around till I clean up from making maple syrup.  This year there are around 35 hens and young ones in one flock and 8 toms and jakes in another.  And 2 real nice toms.....
