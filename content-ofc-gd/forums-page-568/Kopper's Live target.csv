557430,JoshS,2011-03-03 04:26:00,729,I had some good success with the smaller sized smelt for walleye using it like a jerkbait. Haven't tried any of the other baits
557455,fish_fishburn,2011-03-03 13:27:00,1311,"Wow, what a great thread. Hey G, I know you don't feel bad for what you said. I agree with  you, as do alot of others. I haven't tried the Koppers yet but I will some day. I already have a ton of stuff at my disposal that catches fish on a regular basis. Them frogs sure look nice though. Mercer might of been a little sensitive to your comments but you were by no means slagging him. I'm sure Dave is a great guy, and he does a fine job promoting sport fishing. I don't watch his show, because I find his humour a little corny, and silly. That doesn't mean I don't like the man. I love this site because we all have our own opinions and don't mind sharing them with each other.  And of course there is going to be differences,thats what makes it so interesting."
557463,misfish,2011-03-03 14:08:00,29133, AAHHHHH Tubes and spinner baits.
557853,mugsmuffin,2011-03-04 06:04:00,17,I have a few of the Koppers and they look great but I found that the paint chips off fairly easy as compared to all my other lures.
557906,ehg,2011-03-04 14:49:00,2666,They are real nice looking lures. Definitely going get the (walking) Frog for bass this summer. http://www.livetargetlures.com/products/index.php
557936,Aaron Shirley,2011-03-04 15:51:00,655,"Interesting read. I don't see anything wrong with Grimace posting his opinion here. It didn't seem to me like a personal attack. I do however, think that he did paint all ""pros"" with the same brush like Charles stated. I have known Dave Mercer for years, and I have never known him to lie about anything. He has always come across as down to earth and genuine to me. He has always presented himself in a professional manor as far as I know. I will always have respect for the man unless he gives me a reason otherwise, which I don't believe he will.  Many pros really do like the products they endorse and believe in them. IMO Just because someone is paid to endorse a product or is on the pro staff, it doesn't mean that their opinion is null and void on the products. Yes, there are some pros that do not have good ethics, but most do from my experience. It is up to you to judge each pros character and decide if they are trustworthy. Unfortunately, it is easy to be left with a bad taste in your mouth if you have a bad experience with an unethical pro. Quite often a bad apple in the bunch can ruin it for others.  As for the Koppers baits, they do look nice. Although I have been on the Rapala pro staff for 10 years, I do occasionally use other brands. Like tools in a toolbox is a good analogy from earlier in this thread. I got a few Koppers baits this winter to try out when the situation presents itself in clear water. I'm sure they will have their place at certain times, even though I have boxes full of my old faithful Rapalas.  I believe this is all just my unbiased opinion since I no longer have a TV show or have paying sponsors anymore. Take it for what it is worth.  Good fishing!  Aaron"
558251,mercman,2011-03-05 03:57:00,7054,Thanks for this Aaron. I for one am excited about these lures and plan on picking up a selection that i can try out this season. What i am planning on using are the lipless cranks and espcially the frogs for LMB.  Paul

Some guys agree with them and others disagree but that doesn't make one right and it doesn't make the other guy wrong either, it's just the way it is and is what keeps things interesting.  If you don't like what some folks think, it's no reason to lock a thread.

Guys at no time did I say I was leaving the board or not posting. I will just be thinking twice before I comment on any fishing product. This board is a great place with many great people that I am proud to call my friends. It's just to bad that often when any pro posts something he is jumped on and accused of spamming. But hey I guess it is easy to do that when you don't use your real name like I do. Maybe I should register a different screen name that I can just use for such attacks. Hmmmmmm what should it be maybe something really cool....something like Grimace but I think that is already taken lol.  So Dave can openly flame Grimace for stating his honest and frank opinion, but if another ""regular member"" (who isn't a 'pro' was to say something like that the thread would get locked if not deleted.  Just sayin guys. A little nepotism here? Just remember it's guys like us that pay for pro's free rides. A prostaff fisherman really is just a really good salesman."
558397,cwpowell,2011-03-05 16:25:00,265,BTW no offence to Dave Mercer or Aaron Shirley or any of the other pro dudes. I understand they contribute a lot to fishing and conservation efforts. I appreciate everything you guys do for the fishing world.

Or as you saying that I am acting against my principle? In that case I hope you can help me find them.  In all seriousness I think that Grimace has a point, but his comments came off in a way that he did not intend them. As fishing junkies we all realize that pros get paid to endorse product, at least Dave had the class to back up his praise.  On a popular forum like this, at this time of year people can be overly sensitive, as Mercman pointed out.  I need to go fishing."
556994,solopaddler,2011-03-02 03:20:00,8605,"  No, by incongruous I think he means the two trains of thought don't jive.  You can't on one hand promote a product then get your hackles up when criticised.   I have no problem with anybody btw. I've never watched Daves show, but he comes across as being  pretty genuine and I'm sure he's a great guy. You can't fake that."

557054,singingdog,2011-03-02 11:57:00,1047,"Grimace, You did nothing wrong. You stated your opinion in a respectful, nonpersonal way (one of the functions of a public discussion board).  Bit of a hair trigger on Mr. Mercer. Happens all the time on this board when folks confuse the difference between a public discussion forum and a private website. IMHO ,if you make your living promoting stuff, you should be a bit more gracious."
557055,Spiel,2011-03-02 12:00:00,9065, This is a private website owned by the Administrators.
557062,fishhunter,2011-03-02 12:39:00,604,I can tell you I have over 20 of them on my charter boat. The guys that have been out with me on the bay for walleye know they work well. Like any lure some days they work some days they just get washed. But its a tool I would not be with out. ps I dont get paid to say they are good but maybe I should lol
557072,ADB,2011-03-02 13:37:00,444," There is a difference between a private site where one can post their opinions knowing full well that there won't be any direct discourse, and a website that features a discussion forum where opinions will obviously be...well, discussed.  Whether or not the forum is technically private isn't really the point."
557074,outllaw,2011-03-02 13:42:00,1232,all baits are tools. koppers has an excellent finish. as some know i build lures and custom paint. its nice to see a canadian product appear. every one has a go to confidence lure in their tackle box.  they do look to be an excellent walleye and bass lure.
557083,Harrison,2011-03-02 14:19:00,2202,"Whatever bait gives YOU confidence is the key.  I have used these baits, are they my cup of tea, No. But to be fair, I haven't given them a fair shake, I rely on ole faithful.  I am a fan of Lucky Crafts, why, becasue I have confidence in them.  I know if I find fish, they will put them in the boat.  If I was offred a potential sponsored deal with Koppers, then hey, I'd have to get confidence in them and probably would if I spent the time trying.  Besides, as many many avid fisherfolks agree, it is getting on the fish that is the important part.  A lure is simply your tool to get them in the boat.  Fish see shilouettes, remember that.  Unless you are simply on a cast and catch lake.  Then a five of diamonds is killer!!!! lol..."
557096,charlesn,2011-03-02 15:01:00,551,"Grimace, you went and stereotyped all ""pros"" with the same brush.  You basically said their loyalty and opinion is bought and paid for and thus not worth anything.  You equated their honesty to that of a 3-dollar bill.  You did that directly after the biggest fishing celebrity in Canada took the time out of a ridiculously busy schedule to post his expert opinion on a bait he probably has more hours with than any of us tenfold.  Maybe, just maybe, somebody that fishes for a living can provide some insight on a bait without it being all about the almighty dollar.  Maybe in the way he has supported this forum and contributed to it he has earned the privilege of being allowed to put in his opinion without basically being called a shill, a spammer or a flat out liar until proven so.  And if your stereotyping was true - why would ANY pro or anyone with a stake in the fishing industry ever come on here and give their expert opinion?  I mean if all pros were flat out shills, their input would be rejected en masse.  After all, we're not stupid.  Fool me once shame on you - fool me twice I'd rather have to fish a whole season with nothing but the Badonkadonk.    There are pros that I would believe when they say what they used and how they won an event.  Because I've been there and seen what they were using and saw that they said exactly what it was.  Then there are others - George Cochran comes to mind - that have proven they are flat out liars.  He got caught trying to claim he caught fish on a sponsor lure when in fact he was using a competitor's product.  Stuff like that doesn't get forgotten - at least not by me.  But then you also have times like Aaron Martens (a Megabass Pro) admitting he was using the Strike King KVD square bill - in the same colour as KVD at the recent classic.  I think until a man has proven that he isn't worthy of the trust - why not give it to him?  Especially when he is one of our own and doesn't have a history of shilling.  Now perhaps you didn't mean it personally - but then what was the point of your post?  Basically that you don't want anyone that is a ""pro"" to respond to any threads involving a bait?  I mean what if it was a bait they designed?  Should Kulik not respond to any slammer or swammer questions?  I'm at a loss as to what productive value a post like yours has assuming it was not meant as a direct slap against the pros that had already posted.  Frankly I don't have a stake in OFC - I'm a regular lurker but not one of the ""regulars"" if you know what I mean - but the above is my honest view on it.  Mercer or any other pro posting here or not is not going to affect me coming here.  I guess I gotta admit I don't see much positive on them posting on these types of open forums as they do have something to lose so what they can gain is often offset by the time sink of dealing with haters."

But with all that said I know for a fact one MAJOR fishing celebrity that LIED through his teeth promoting his new ""Shadling"" lure while salmon fishing in Devils Hole in the lower Niagara River. It was a slow day and only one salmon was caught on a Kwickfish but when the show aired he swore that his ""Shadling"" out fished all other lures 4 - 1....some guys just don't have any principles when it comes to money....

I see it as Dave has been a good friend to this website and posted his opinion of a product...  this was not a tv commercial or during a talk at a seminar .. so I will take him at his word   but I still have no problem with people/Grimace stating his opinion, which as a discussion board we have discussed and people have get to make up their minds on what they believe the truth is  as I have done from this interesting thread"

557201,manitoubass2,2011-03-02 19:26:00,11391,"Just my .02,  I have no issues with Dave offering an opinion on these baits, or any others. But I do see why some would be skeptical. Pro fishermen do this all the time though, and it's a part of their livelyhood, and thats respectable. Until an angler has obviously lied about something, we should take them at their word IMO. Even us anglers do the same thing all the time, right?  Anyhow, about the baits. I think there crafted very well, and the price reflects the product. I have no issues paying a few extra dollars for a bait that cost money to produce in quality.  I've used some of these baits in the past 8 months, and I like them. They definitely have their place in the tackle box. But, for a man that mainly fishes a stained river, they don't produce as good as other cranks etc for me. The realistic patterns are great, for clear water. When I tried them on clear bodies of water, they worked great, but so did about 20 other baits.  One thing I did that worked very well was shallow trolling the perch bait for walleyes, and that was alot of fun"

556873,Gregoire,2011-03-01 23:41:00,1397,"Hey Grimace, Thanks for pointing out the obvious, Just like the sky is blue, professional fisherman, especially the very successful ones with TV shows, have sponsors. If given the opportunity to endorse a product that supports them, they should. Dave is also sponsored by many other fishing companies, yet I do not see him plastering the board advocating them. He made some specific comments about why he likes the live target lures. If he had said something like ""They are the best lures that I have ever used, everyone should go out and buy a ton"" that would have been different."
556876,HTHM,2011-03-01 23:48:00,4082,"As a fishing advisor, Dave is very good and credible. If he says this is a good thing I will listen and probably purchase because of the respect that I have for his opinion. It worked very well when I bought the Dave's special rapala a few years ago. In my line of work I shill for my employer as well, however I do so with the same integrity that Dave shows. With the manufacturing capability that we have today, the small refinements are what make the difference. I can catch fish on a Barbie rod and reel, but I prefer to use my (insert favorite rod here) combined with (insert favorite reel here) because it is much nicer to use. Nails can be driven just as well with a 22 oz estwing but that $300 hammer just feels sooooo good. Live target baits are a very nice looking bait, and probably will result in more hook-ups if presented properly. So Dave keep doing what you're doing and I'm hoping for a new FYI soon."

556952,Gregoire,2011-03-02 02:14:00,1397," Your argument was similar but the context was quite different. Your post on this topic could be seen as a direct reply to the endorsement that some pro's were giving. I would take offense to your comments if I were a pro.  I also do not think that it is necessary to state the obvious, as you seem to enjoy doing."
556956,Eazy,2011-03-02 02:17:00,260,"Oh, my!....What have I done?  Amazing how arguments came ascend from a mere thread about fishing lures?  Let's see, hmmmm.......How about: Bombardier rocks, and Arctic cat sucks?"
556962,mercman,2011-03-02 02:23:00,7054,"  You my friend are gonna get me in deep doo doo. I will be good, i will be good, i will be good.............."
556964,kickingfrog,2011-03-02 02:30:00,8333,People get paid to promote a product. That's business (and I'm fine with that). People are overly sensitive when this is pointed out. That's incongruous.
556966,Eazy,2011-03-02 02:31:00,260,"I would have to say that my favorite fishing shows would have to be a toss up between Bob Izumi's real fishing show and Dave Mercers, just watching a episode of either puts me in a good mood no matter what! Dave, I like the SCORE part on your show, cuz it cuts through the TV part of the program and reveals the truth that even the Pro's have to work to get fish in the boat.......Keep up the good work Bud!"
556392,stubbex1,2011-02-28 19:08:00,164,"I first started using Grant Koppers baits on a fly-in to Gogama.  One of the guys i went with knows grant quite well, and he had a whole bagfull of the 3 inch golden smelts.  Those baits out produced any rapala's we threw out there.  The only complaint I had was that the paint was wearing off were the walleye where hitting it.  Since then I have used most of the other Live Target baits, and have been VERY impressed.  Can't wait to try the frog this summer"
556429,steverowbotham,2011-02-28 20:43:00,1800,I have done well throwing the smelt pattern and craw cranks.  I'm stocked up on frogs for the year too
556438,Mark Kulik,2011-02-28 21:23:00,348,Live Target lures are for real! awesome looks aside -they catch fish! my fav's so far are the lipless and the smelt jerkbait -really looking forward to using the frog and wakebait this year.
556441,BillM,2011-02-28 21:32:00,17367,"Lures have always been out to catch the fishermen, not the fish"
556516,jeffw,2011-03-01 01:22:00,267,The koppers baits are my go to lures. Slayed the walleye on the perch patterns the last couple years and went through 2 smelt patterns this opener. The golden shiner is my fvouriteb crankbit as well. The only major problem I have had is that smelt baits I had both took on water but apparently the early ones had this problem which I have been told was fixed and the finish wears off very easily. I have a box full of them and will be adding the pumkinseed patterns as well. Cheers Jeff
556520,solopaddler,2011-03-01 01:34:00,8605,  HAHAHA! Gotta love beer goggles.
556522,BiggFish,2011-03-01 01:39:00,40,"Hey guys,  What size of frog are you throwing the 5/8 or 3/4? I bought a few of the 5/8 and they look mint!"
556557,Eazy,2011-03-01 02:55:00,260,"Does the finish wear off easily on the new ones, or has this problem been corrected as well?"
556582,MCTFisher9120,2011-03-01 04:26:00,3761," Do they compress down as easy as the Snag Proof Perfect frogs Steve? Only thing I'm not sure about, needs to be a good soft frog or appearance doesn't matter.  Mike"
556584,Cudz,2011-03-01 04:39:00,2652,"Wow! Some real celebrity responses on this thread.  If Dave, Mark and Steve all say these baits are the business then I will get some. Dave check your PMs I sent you a pretty funny one about my daughter and her obsession with you (weird kid)  Hey Mark, I got out once more on simcoe in the fall after seeing you and it was a crazy cold windy white capped and nasty.  Had the trolling motor on full and it lasted about 4 hours.  Only lure that caught fish was your smoke blue coloured swim bait.  I like it.  When are you going to start selling those things?"
556590,Grimace,2011-03-01 05:03:00,2020,"I hate to be a stick in the mud but these guys tell you what baits to buy because they are paid to.  It was not long ago that everyone was sucking up all the Rapala hype because someone was filling up the glasses with the kool aid.  Rapala make a great lure as does Live Target.  Do not take a pros word on it though as they are paid to tell you.  When everyday folk tell you bout a lure, that is the time to listen up."
556593,Cudz,2011-03-01 05:12:00,2652,Steve is sposored by livetargetand gets paid to tell me what bait to buy? I will have to check into that.
556609,Grimace,2011-03-01 10:49:00,2020,"Obviously not Steve.  Steve was just giving his honest opinion.  It seems funny though how the pros instantly started yapping about how incredible live targets are the moment they started pushing paychecks their way. It is not funny or peculier, it is just business.  Live Targets are wonderful as are Rapalas and a bunch of others. The fact that a few pros have switched to Live Target from Rapala does not make Live Target any better or Rapala any worse.  Just as others have said (and were not jumped on), dont fall for the hype."
556672,charlesn,2011-03-01 15:08:00,551,"I think it's a Canadian company - if not at least the original inventor was Canadian.  In fact, I think I remember reading about the baits first on here many many moons ago before it was a bigger thing.  Love to see a Canadian tackle company grow and become successful.  Like the Rod Glove the past few years which has had phenomenal success.  I personally have never thrown one so I can't comment on its effectiveness, but just think it is great to seee a Canuck fishing company doing well and hope we continue to support the little guys - because if we don't the Pure Fishing Empire or one of the other giants will buy up everything and our only choices will be mass-produced stuff with different names on it.  I'm maybe a freak but I don't consider those baits to be all that expensive.  I use soft plastic senkos that cost like a buck a piece and I've lost them to rock bass on the first cast and on a good day have gone through 40.  Would never even think to complain about it though - because if I'm catching fish on it - it's worth every penny.  At least with a hardbait or a frog you can catch a bunch of fish on it.  I mean rods and reels can go for $1000 a combo and a bass boat and truck are like $50-100,000.  On a per fish basis - the lure/bait cost is pretty insubstantial and yet probably the single most important thing.  I'm only sponsored by my personal VISA, AMEX and MC so of course everything I say is gospel!  Charles"
556682,lookinforwalleye,2011-03-01 15:37:00,4399,"Ain`t no 1000 dollar combo`s in my boat!  my wife thinks I am certifiable for spending 300-400 on a combo, as a side note she is back on holiday again in the DR so I got another new combo!  Your point is well made, my plastics bag probably has some 300-400 dollars worth of stuff in it at any given time.  I may pick up a top water bait or two as I love to fish topwater but I still think the fancy paint job is more for the consumer than the fish, can a bass actually see the fancy paint job on the top of the bait?"
556722,charlesn,2011-03-01 17:49:00,551," Me either Lookin, but we can dream.  When new stuff appears in my garage and the wife notices (very seldom since my garage is like a condemned hazardous waste area) I just explain that I got that stuff free from my buddies who have too much.  lol  I've learned to cut the tags off right away!  Charles"
556735,Dave Mercer,2011-03-01 18:27:00,148,"  Hey Grimace, Comments like this my friend is why less and less pro's are posting on this or any board! Thanks for reminding me not to post fishing info on a fishing board that I have been a member of and supported in MANY,MANY ways for years!!!"
556738,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-03-01 18:31:00,1107, NO don't let the negative nacies bring you down Dave LOL (I'm just teasing Grimace)
556787,wildeye rainbow,2011-03-01 20:54:00,123,I like the detail on the Koppers lures.  I started out with a couple of the original smelt.  They worked nicely on walleye and SM bass on the French River last summer.  I saw one of the fishing shows where the swimbait herring were being used.  I liked the action.  I went to my local tackle store in St T to see if they had any & they had the whole line of the new Koppers.  I bought a swimbait herring & I can't wait to use it on the French and the Pickeral R systems in a few months.  I'm going to get a frog or two as well.
556793,mercman,2011-03-01 21:05:00,7054,"Dave If you ever decide to read this thread again, How do you find the live target for use in stained water. Is the rattle enough to bring the fish in, or should i still focus on the presentation of the lure ie retrieval speed and style?  "
556794,Mark Kulik,2011-03-01 21:05:00,348,"I'm with Dave on this one! now I remember why I havnt posted for so long Grimace! truth is I get paid by a lure company-the one i own! not Live Target, I happen to be a fan of lures that work for me LT is Canadian and makes a quality product , there are lots of really good lures out there, I'm just stating my experiences as an angler, I dont consider myself a celebrety but I am a guy who has been successful fishing competitevly, so I use lures that I feel give me an edge, thing is for every Grimace there are lots of really nice people on this site, many of which I have met, .  Hi Chris-nice to hear from you, and glad the swimmers worked for you , we are waiting for packaging -othewise they will be ready this spring, say hi the family for me! see you soon.  Mark"
556806,MCTFisher9120,2011-03-01 21:25:00,3761,"I for one watch too much fishing shows when I'm back in Oshawa and chillin at home. Sure you only see a select amount of baits in any one show but the point is that after the show like The Show, Extreme Angler, and the Lost Lake/Classic Pattern's type shows you understand how to really fish a certain lure or technique. Classic Pattern's yesterday gave me lot's of great info on how to fish deep crankbaits right down to color, line, rod,retrieves and tips on avoiding cover etc...I would rather a show that focus on specific baits week after week, they may be the same brand as they are on the shirt but regardless any show when I can sit for a half hour and learn how to , work a LT perch for walleye,fish 1.5oz spinnerbaits deep etc.. this is why I watch TV. To talk crap about great Pro's and how they ""market"" everything is silly...what does a guy at a car lot do? His Job.  Keep up the post's Dave and Mark, you two rank up top in my books and when I see your posts I read them well because unlike average joe I learn from you.  Tightlines,  Mike"
556809,steverowbotham,2011-03-01 21:32:00,1800," I havent used them yet Mike, but they are a very soft frog, I wouldnt have bought them otherwise.  I'm really excited to try them out"
556816,Grimace,2011-03-01 21:43:00,2020,"You can imply that I am not a nice person all you want.  It is not a correct assertion, and is based on little evidence as we have never met.  I stand by my words that state when people are paid to sell something or endorse it they will lose a bit of credibility with some people.  Others will take there fame on faith trust them 100 percent.  I am in the first group."
556820,lookinforwalleye,2011-03-01 21:46:00,4399,"  I did not see anything wrong with what Grimace posted, after all it`s a discussion board Dave and there are going to be differing opinions. I think most here understand what the ""pro`s"" job is and that is to sell product if there was no product to sell there would be no magazines,tv shows,trade shows etc.  It would be to bad if you decide to adandon this site and all the members here that have supported you and your sponsors for years just because one member posted something you didn`t like!!!"
555937,Eazy,2011-02-27 15:30:00,260,"Saw Dave Mercer using these for ""eyes"" today, seemed to do well, but took a look at them, and they seemed a bit pricey compared to traditional Rapalas, which are proven walleye takers."
555940,kickingfrog,2011-02-27 15:38:00,8333,They are another tool in the toolbox. Walleye can be caught on a hook and a free worm dug-up from the garden.
555943,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-02-27 15:40:00,1107,They are actually priced fairly low compared to some premium hard baits that the bass guys buy (I rarely use cranks )I will definately be putting a few of the perch in the cart when I do my annual shopping spree at BPS this year I have yet to try them but I am more than willing to pay the few bucks more for them over the rapalas just because they look so good their preformance on the water will determine if I'm a repeat purchaser or if I will stick with old faithful rapalas I can't wait to try the frogs though.
555946,Eazy,2011-02-27 15:44:00,260,"Yah I know eh, I thought the traditinal shad-raps were a bit pricey at 8 bucks a pop.."
555951,lookinforwalleye,2011-02-27 15:49:00,4399,What all these fancy new lures are really really good at is removing large sums of money from your pocket!!!
555959,Eazy,2011-02-27 16:09:00,260,"LOL!.......Yah, and if like Mercer's catching fish with them then you gotta run out and buy at least one of every size and color!"
555965,danbouck,2011-02-27 16:14:00,4380,The perch would be killer for pike
555971,lookinforwalleye,2011-02-27 16:26:00,4399," You may remember 2-3 years ago Dave had a crankbait done by Rapala with his ""special colour"" well I must admit I bought one and I must say it`s a killer bait I caught my largest small and largemouth Bass with that little crankbait, it has earned a spot on the wall of fame!!!"
555980,adempsey,2011-02-27 17:11:00,1498,Don't be a victim of the marketing machine.  You will not catch more walleye using these cranks.  Just like you won't start dating five supermodels if you drink Bud Light.
555985,mercman,2011-02-27 17:25:00,7054,"I'm going to be trying something new(to me) this spring, for small and LMB. Bombers Badonk-a-Donk. I saw it on WFN, and it seems to have a really wild top water action to it. It aslo has rattles, so i believe it will be good for the waters i fish,stained.I bought 3 High pitch and i low pitch, in a few colors that seem to work here. I will keep you up to date. I really bought it for the silly name, but i also feel good about the way they swim."
555987,MCTFisher9120,2011-02-27 17:30:00,3761,"I bought the LT Blueback Herring swimbait, its around 4 or 5 inches long and looks awesome, can't wait to try it and buy some more in different sizes. Not falling for the frog's, my snag proof's are super squishy and perfect."
555989,danbouck,2011-02-27 17:33:00,4380, Speak for yourself
556025,greyhawk,2011-02-27 19:37:00,33,"Grant Koppers has put a lot of effort into these baits paying particular attention to species detail. They are fine tuned and only use the best materials. I have used his baits and have found them quite productive. For what, I feel, is a high quality bait their price is reasonable in today's market."

556089,uglyfish,2011-02-27 21:43:00,981,"The live target baits are amazing. The detail on them is just unreal, and when ur fishing clear waters, that can make a big difference. But the way he designed the baits and the way they move in the water is a big attracting factor to fish. Like someone mentioned 12 bucks for a premium bait is very reasonable compared to 20 and up for lucky craft and megabass.  They catch fish. And that's what we all wanna do!"
556159,troutologist,2011-02-28 01:59:00,951,"If you are interested in catching walleye through the ice, the golden shiner series is awesome.  One of the big differences with these is the tone/pitch of the rattles. This subtle difference between, Live Targets, Clackn' Raps, Rattln Raps and Rattle traps really can mean the difference between a few or many fish. Proven again today, Live Target and Lindy Darter, both or which have louder, lower pitch rattles outfished the others."
556173,bassmaster4,2011-02-28 02:39:00,801,just picked up two of the frogs both the soft and hard as well as a pumpkinseed crank they look terrific cant wait to try them out
556177,fishdawg,2011-02-28 02:45:00,912,im a big fan of the line up of Koppers Live Targets  this brown crushed the shiner model      gonna give the smelt patterns a go in a couple weeks behind planner boards along Lake Ontario's south shore
556197,Cudz,2011-02-28 03:15:00,2652,Drink enough Bud Lights and everyone looks like a supermodel
556346,Dave Mercer,2011-02-28 16:39:00,148,Guys as always every bait has it's place but as our water get clearer Live Targets place is getting bigger & bigger. If you look at what goes into the Live Target baits and compare apples to apples they are a deal. Bottom line is if used right you will hammer some big fish on them. If you don't believe me watch that show again and pay very close attention to what bait my fishing buddy is using that day! It's not a Live Target but I think deep down he wished it was lol!  I missed see you all at the Fishing Show this year but I hope to see a bunch of you at Bass Pro Shops on March 27th at 1pm.  Dave
556351,mercman,2011-02-28 16:49:00,7054, Thanks Dave !!! I started my collection of them yesterday and i KNOW they will work big time.
556353,PainInTheBass,2011-02-28 16:56:00,102,"I have a lot of confidence in the Live Target Pumpkinseed.  I have had marginal success on the perch.  I can say that when compared to the new Rapalas out there, the difference in finish is incredible.  Whether that difference is worth the extra few bucks to you will be up to you once you compare them.  I don't have the bank roll to fully deck myself out with Koppers lures, but I do have a number of them, and am quite happy with them."
556386,canadadude,2011-02-28 18:51:00,769,"I agree there on the pricey side but Grant has put alot of attention into the details on his cranks and they work.It may just be a confidence thing, but the bottom line is these cranks catch fish and for a few extra $$$$ I like the confidence aspect that I'm throwing a winner.I think they are one of the finest baits to hit the market in long time and from the results of alot of anglers there definitly a proven goto bait"
