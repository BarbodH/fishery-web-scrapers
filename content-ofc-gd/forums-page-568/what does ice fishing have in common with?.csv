557435,dhickey,2011-03-03 04:57:00,1038,couldnt sleep last night. but somthing did cross my mind and made me chuckle a few times today.                                    	what does ice fishing have in common with divorce? 	it cost to mutch/  its cold / you never know what you will walk away with if any thing/  you keep trying 2moro is always better!  	any one have some good advice on preserving and storing antique tackle .? inherrited my fathers tackle last fall. lotts of cool stuff/bucktails/plugs/and a fur muskrat set .   	????
557442,mercman,2011-03-03 11:48:00,7054,"Keep the lures dry and clean. DO NOT try and refinish them. Lately my Bro has had some of my dads older more rare lures mounted in a shadowbox, framed and covered in glass. He keeps them on the wall in his den.  Paul"
