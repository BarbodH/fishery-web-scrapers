557480,lew,2011-03-03 14:57:00,12766,"Seems to be a bunch of folks on this board who decide that if THEY don't like a topic, it should be locked up, or deleted or otherwise made so others can't express an opinion on the topic.  Too many times lately somebody will actually post in a thread that THEY think it should be locked or deleted.  For those of you that don't seem to know, and there appears to be quite a few, we have a very good team of moderators around here that do an excellent job of keeping this place running smoothly. If a topic gets outta hand, they'll decide when to lock it up or whatever else they deem necessary.  Just because YOU don't like what's being said in a post, doesn't mean I don't like it and I may just like to express my 2 cents worth.  If YOU don't like a post, STOP READING IT.  Contact your local mod and let him decide.  Course, that's just my opinion and some of you may want it locked up"
557481,addy79,2011-03-03 14:59:00,573,"I think we need to shut this one down...LOL  just kidding, im with you all the way on that, Lew!"

557498,mercman,2011-03-03 15:33:00,7054,"I agree Lew !!! They have quite a job to do. And the next time i get the urge to be silly, like last time, i will delete myself before posting !!!    "

557502,spinnerbaitking,2011-03-03 15:41:00,1622,Well said is it time to get the boat out yet SBK
557506,TJQ,2011-03-03 15:54:00,7806,"Lew, I'm afraid that's a bit outta line... LOL..  but really all ya gotta do is hit the report button on the lower left hand side if you think a thread is outta line. Were not on 24/7 but pretty darn close!!"
557524,misfish,2011-03-03 16:31:00,29133,  Good luck with that.I have tried for years.  LOL    Why do we pay ya the big bucks for then
557531,GBW,2011-03-03 16:49:00,8460,"and for those that don't know, the mod's have a sub forum that the rest of us cannot see.  this is where they talk back and forth about who to watch out for and if a topic should be locked or deleted.  oh and who goes on mod-q or gets banned too..."
557541,HTHM,2011-03-03 17:38:00,4082,"Boy, wouldn't we like to see that!???? All the gossip and stuff that is said about us by the powers that be."
557544,GBW,2011-03-03 17:45:00,8460,Oh I know what they said/say about you all the time...
557592,aplumma,2011-03-03 19:39:00,6896, Well the good news is 95% of your names never come up.  Lew just as T.J. said the report button is the answer for people who want to voice their concern on a post. That raises a red flag for all of the Mods to see and then we can decide. A lot of the time if someone just posts in the  thread it will not get caught till the next mod does a full read on the board usually in an hour or two.   Art
557594,Spiel,2011-03-03 19:46:00,9065,"  I believe Lew's point is simply a message to all those who think the general forum is a place to post/announce your concerns/complaints and gripes, it's not!  Or more to the point, if Lew used the ""report button"" the message he's sending wouldn't reach the target audience."
557596,Handlebarz,2011-03-03 19:51:00,3790,STOP READING IT  Monique Lew yelled at me can you please give him a time out my feelings are hurt.  I think I will be leaving now I know there is a site out there that would not let this stuff happen they care about my feelings and dont eat fish sund like a better place I'm gone.
557597,GBW,2011-03-03 19:51:00,8460,"um, who's the 5% then?"
557602,HTHM,2011-03-03 19:55:00,4082,Don't let the door hit you in   on the way out
