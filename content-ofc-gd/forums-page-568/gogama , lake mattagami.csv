557473,lplp,2011-03-03 14:29:00,83,"We are going on our annual fishing trip to the gogama area ,specifically on lake mattagami and staying at twin j lodge.. Has anyone have any experience there, i know there is a fishing derby there on the weekend we arrive so we cant get in until the sunday afternoon ,june 5 . From what i have seen looks pretty good as i did go through the fishing derby pictures they had up for the reserve. We are targeting walleye mostly and there are 10 of us going this year .Two cottages are booked for us and we have been doing this for a long time , like 30 plus years plus my father has been doing this even longer and he has kept it going for us and we have new blood going ,it has changed over the years from the people coming and passing away unfortunatly ,and my dad is in his late 80's and still coming with us and he looks forward to it as much as any body else. My fishing partner and i get ready for this even after last years ,and we say just around the corner .This year we are going in a canoe for the two of us so hopefully we can get into spots the other guys wont be able to .He has pontoons set up on it ,swivel seats ,electric motor ,fish finder,stereo and two washrooms .Should be an experience as usually we take my boat which is a crestliner with a 85 horse ,but last year we hit a rock and kind of cracked the lower unit ,but still works .Trying to find a map of lake and not having much success so far , i usually can find them on anglers atlas but not there ,, can anyone pdf one and upload ,, would be great , i know we will get one once there but need to see the lake better with depths now to ease our little one track fishing minds that have been stuck in winter mode for awhile now .We went to gowganda last year and stayed at lookoutpoint camp ,, great place to stay and the hosts larry and vicki were the best .We didnt go into the back lakes like we should of"

I believe there are three lodges on the lake.  I could not find a free map, but I believe you can purchase one.  I cannot comment on the quality of the map though so I suggest, if you decide to purchase it, you contacting them first to be sure what exactly it is.  http://www.worldofmaps.com/search_results.cfm?keyword=mattagami&x=0&y=0"
557542,Targa01,2011-03-03 17:41:00,46,"Mattagami Lake is a great place to fish, It is one of the best lakes in northern Ontario to fish for walleye and pike and in June the smallmouth fishing is great too.  I fish Mattagami Lake a lot in the summer. I fish the tournament every year there and depending on the weather the fish could be anywhere.  I have stayed at Twin J before and its a great place. For a map of the lake unfortunately there isn't much, we don't have contour maps in the north and if there is a map, there not worth buying. As for fishing in a canoe, that might be tough. Mattagami is a big lake and usually the south east arm is the place to go at that time of year. Twin J is right on the sanctuary line so you can't fish the one side till June 15th. Hope this info helps but if you would like to know more on the lake just let me know"

557613,Targa01,2011-03-03 20:48:00,46,"For fishing at night it is also a great way to catch walleyes in Mattagami Lake, Theres a spot not to far from twin J that is really good for fishing before dark. Even right across from twin J in the logs is really good too, but last year the water was so low that all those logs were on shore. hopefully this year the water will be back up"
