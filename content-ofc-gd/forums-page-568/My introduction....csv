557911,danklegrand,2011-03-04 14:56:00,55,"Hi all, I discovered this amazing place late last summer and have been convincing myself to join ever since.  I'm 24, and I love fishing!  I've been involved in the sport as long as I can remember and I'm thankful to have been introduced at an early age.  I'm from Flamborough, Ontario, but most of my fishing is centered in the near-north Parry Sound area.  My home water is Bear Lake, Ontario (just outside of Sprucedale on the 518).  My parents have a cottage there, where I spend every chance I get on the water chasing Smallmouth Bass, Pike, and Walleye.  I'm no pro, and I have a lot to learn.  Some days the fishing is slow, but I just love to be out on the water.  My best experiences are usually top water fishing for smallies at dusk…  I love watching them come up and slam a popper!  I consider myself a pretty lucky guy because I have an amazing girlfriend who loves the outdoors and fishing almost as much as I do.  She's my best fishing buddy, and it's one of our favorite ways to spend time together…  Even on the days that she out-fishes me!  I just recently upgraded from my little 12' aluminum to a 16' Grumman side-console with a 30hp Johnson, which gives us a little more room and helps us explore some bigger northern lakes.  We like to spend the summer months camping at different Provincial Parks and trying our luck at new lakes.  Last summer we went to Restoule and had a blast.  I'll be honest…  In all the years that I've been fishing I'm still waiting on ""the big one"".  Most fish I've landed have been average size and we've had a lot of fun, but I'm still in search of that monster pike, walleye or huge bass photo!  I find this site to be very informative, and I think there's a very knowledgeable group of all different types of anglers here.  With spring just around the corner and season openers in a few more months, I'm sure everyone is itching to get out on the water!  I hope to learn from all of you, and I hope I can contribute to other's success and love of the sport in return.  I look forward to posting pictures and reports from lakes I visit in the future, because some of yours are awesome! Cheers! Dan  Here are a few pics from last year... Just cause we all love em!  Hopefully this works...       "

557955,MCTFisher9120,2011-03-04 16:36:00,3761,"Looks like you are in a good area to catch some nice fish, maybe this year you will get into the ""big one"" like you are hoping for. If you are chasing a trophy try bigger baits, if you like a HJ try the biggest size, if you like topwaters like Skitter Pop's give there biggest popper a go for a few nights.  Thanks for the intro, and welcome to OFC!"

However, we won't sell the boat because it's something we both enjoy!  I'm sure life will throw us some curves, but I hope we always have time for fishing! Lucky man indeed!"
