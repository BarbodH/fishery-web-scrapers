In the fall fish go deep in the Kawarthas and i find myself jigging walleye in 45 foot plus water. More often than not whatever i catch has air bladder issues, whether it is a walleye, perch, rock bass, carp, etc... With new regulations limiting catch and keep of walleye on Kawarthas i basically no longer do this fishing. Just trolling for muskies is fine   Just curious if lakers and whities survive this ascent differently, no doubt perch don't. Anyone?"

557584,Spiel,2011-03-03 19:10:00,9065," Exactly, and Lakers in my experience can do it rather quickly. I've had them chase my jigging spoons up out of 100 plus feet of water into less than 20 feet reeling as fast I could for a lure change. Quite an eye opener and now a standard in my on ice and open water tactics for vertical jigging."
557588,ehg,2011-03-03 19:19:00,2666,"Well that explains it, i guess. Every other species seems to bite the dust. Lakers are the deep water evolutionary specialists. Thanks for quick reply"
