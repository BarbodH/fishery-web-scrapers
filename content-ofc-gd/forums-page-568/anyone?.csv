557412,dhickey,2011-03-03 03:31:00,1038,slow never seen laker at nite . a few whiteys from 7-10 more of a drink fest back in the day
557516,camillj,2011-03-03 16:13:00,1988,I'd be more worried about ski-doos flying around in the dark .... Lakers will bite at night .. but not nearly as active as daytime ... if you are over on the east side you may find Walleye which are of course nocturnal feeders... and pike will bite 24hrs a day  Me I say ice fishing is best from 9:00 - 5:00 ... instead of being behind a desk
557553,beginner,2011-03-03 18:05:00,542,  I was just thinkin lol... because now that I can drive the car.. And I normally do nite fishing in summer.. This thing comes to mind.. haha  thnx for the info... bfisher
557559,Governator,2011-03-03 18:16:00,879,If you're doing it alone it just sounds cold & miserable to me and less safe.
557562,beginner,2011-03-03 18:30:00,542,"I have my friends coming with me.. but just want to know some tips and what to expect out there.. thus the ski-doos run 24hrs... If so I need to bring portable lite.. those things, plus info about the fish how's the bite at night..."
557644,Marko,2011-03-03 22:40:00,854,I would buy about 10 glowing sticks and put them around my hut and maybe even more on the hut. You`ll glow green more then an alien but with all the idiots driving ski-doo`s these days you have to make sure they can see you from a mile away!
