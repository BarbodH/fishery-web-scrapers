557629,icefisherman,2011-03-03 21:58:00,952,"One more trip with my boys today - chasing the whities on Simcoe.... We've had some great time with RickOnt and his buddies... Started about 8:30am but took about 3 hours before they got hungry...didn't have to move at all as we were marking fish most of the time....just that we had to work for them,.... One of those days where my favorite Meegs didn't produce well....only got one whitie on Meegs despite changing colors all the time trying different presentations etc. Almost all fish on Williams... 88 fow....fish is still hiding in the deep... Cleaning time followed by another batch for the smoker tomorrow... Couple shots from the day:       Cheers, Ice Fisherman"

557636,Terry,2011-03-03 22:14:00,14456,always great to get out with the kids   nice pile for fish there
557638,beginner,2011-03-03 22:20:00,542,"wow you've done it again... nice fishies, that will be good for smoke  yum yum lol"
557640,irishfield,2011-03-03 22:25:00,26272,"  It sure is Brian.. 4 more fish for the table!! lol  Great day out Emil, glad the boys are enjoying the outings."
557643,wallacio,2011-03-03 22:40:00,475,Nice haul.   Any issues with crossing pressure cracks with the vehicle?
557780,icefisherman,2011-03-04 02:45:00,952," Well most cracks I saw today were narrow, flat and frozen over... I did see one that was huge though (3+ feet wide) with open water ...stayed clear from that one. One should still keep eyes open as things change very quickly...the lake was rumbling all day today so it may open new crack at any time...  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"

Investigation is finished and we're back in operation as of tonight but we're 2 days behind schedule. Sunday may still be do-able and we still have next weekend!
