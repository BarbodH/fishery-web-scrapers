622807,Harrison,2011-09-19 14:06:00,2202," Yeppers, I was.  Beyond tough fishng!!  Parka in the morning, short and t shirt afternoon.  I screwed up my prayer in the morning too, I forgot the word ""and"" between Small - Large.  ""Dear Lord, please help me boat some strong healthy Small Large mouth bass"""
622809,lew,2011-09-19 14:10:00,12766, You can't hope for more than you ask for
622339,lew,2011-09-17 21:46:00,12766,"My daughter and I headed over to Pigeon for a few hours today looking for a musky or 2 but never found any this time around. We hit up all our usual spots and found nothing so we ran down into Upper Buck for an hour but still came up empty. We always have alot of fun together on the water and that's what it's all about.  If we get skunked we just say we were out for a boat ride.  Like I always say , you don't need to catch a fish to have a great day of fishing.  Water temps were in the mid 60's and the weeds are still plentiful, green and healthy.  Hi-lite of our day was having a few deer wander down to the waters edge for a drink close to where we were casting and I was able to get a couple pics.  Two of them still had their spots so I'm guessing they were just out for a stroll with Mom.    "
622340,danbouck,2011-09-17 21:50:00,4380,Great pics!
622341,scugpg,2011-09-17 21:52:00,1373,Still fun getting out I got skunked on lower last week. Hear its doing decent now though.
622344,Joey,2011-09-17 22:19:00,9122,"Lew skunked????  I don't believe it  Yep, bonding with your daughter out on the water is definately a great day, fish or not.  And the extra bonus was the deer.  Great pics Lew."
622345,misfish,2011-09-17 22:33:00,29133,"Well you had a great day. Family doing what they do.  It was great to be out cutt,n with my pop today.    Oh,we got skunked too.LOL"
622346,Handlebarz,2011-09-17 22:34:00,3790,sounds like it was a nice day out there for you two Lew
622348,lew,2011-09-17 22:40:00,12766," More times that I care to admit Joey   Thanks guys, it was a fun day for sure !!"
622354,Roy,2011-09-17 23:27:00,13728,"Lew you've already caught more than your share of muskies. You had a great day out with Sheri, that's perfect. Are you still getting lots of deer at your house?"
622357,lew,2011-09-17 23:41:00,12766,"Don't see too many deer this time of year Roy, but there's loads of them as soon as the snow arrives. Seems like the woods around here are where they all yard up for the winter and then their everywhere."
622363,Rizzo,2011-09-18 00:02:00,4754,sounds like a successful day anyways...time with family and see some of nature...i wish my musky days were that good!
622372,Leecher,2011-09-18 00:22:00,7832,Sorry to hear about the skunk Lew but at least you got quality time out on the water with your daughter Doesn't get much better than that Leechman
622383,bigbuck,2011-09-18 01:55:00,2449,"We went bait fishing today and just jigged on the top end of Big Island. Tomorrow is musky day. As much as I wanted to wash a few lures, I succumbed to peer pressure and jigged for walleye, caught a few but jeez are they ever small.one of our guys tied into a high 40's class fish while pulling a worm harness, the fish broke off boatside. He was devastated, he's a big musky guy from Pittsburgh and didn't want the fish to get away with a mouth full of hooks. Lew, I think I saw you cruising the back end of Big Island in the early afternoon. You were going pretty good. Trolling motor is mounted and works like a charm. Thanks Dax! Defnitely prefer the powerdrive over the all terrain."
622423,lew,2011-09-18 07:35:00,12766,"Yeah, that was probably us Bruce, we headed south around 1:30 or so. Good luck when you head back out today."
622424,DT10Sam,2011-09-18 09:43:00,480,"Sounds like someone tipped the muskies that you would be in the area Lew and they shut down, still a great day with family makes up for it and creates memories. That's not like you wearing that white stripe down your back, I don't think you know what a skunk is at all.Lol Just means another day to go and get em.  Regards, Sam"
622428,lew,2011-09-18 10:28:00,12766, Any excuse to go fishing is a good one Sam
622430,Billy Bob,2011-09-18 10:34:00,5865,Nice outing anyways.....but you missed your opportunity for Redneck surf and turf..
622435,lew,2011-09-18 11:08:00,12766, The only deer shooting I do is with my point & shoot in the back yard Bob  
622572,ehg,2011-09-18 19:33:00,2666,"Sounds like a great day, with your daughter, Lew. That area of Pigeon is my fave. Wish i was up there as well, muskies will always be caught by you eventually."
622638,mike rousseau,2011-09-18 21:57:00,4661,"its that ""hit and miss"" time of year...  last saturday my brother and dad boated 2 skis in 20-30 minutes....  this saturday... dad got skunked...  the weather and sunlight and time of day effects the fish so much more in the fall...  i have a love/hate relationship with this season...lol  im sure youll get your fair share in the weeks to come...  im gunna button down and try to put some lunge in the boat in the next month or so... even got some small musky trips planned as well... cant wait..."

622785,lew,2011-09-19 12:49:00,12766," For sure Pete, and it's always good to have you along to work the net"
622786,outllaw,2011-09-19 12:50:00,1232,"simply awesome lew. most cant see the forest for the tree,s.."
622787,Harrison,2011-09-19 12:54:00,2202,"Nice deer shots Lew.  I was on Upper Buckhorn Sat and Sun this past weekend.  4 musky caught and had one turn the boat 45 degrees after I set the hook on it before slicing my 80lb braid, it was a giant.  All fish were caught on main lake weedlines with a vertical presentation.  And not on purpose!"
622803,lew,2011-09-19 13:54:00,12766," Maybe I should take up bass fishing Phil  We were only on Upper Buck for an hour or two, from around 1:30 on.  Lotsa bass boats running around so I figured there might be a tourney goin on, were you in one of them ??"
