621957,Terry,2011-09-16 00:08:00,14456,I felt bad for the guy  but he didn't have a snowball hope in hell of getting the money
621958,kickingfrog,2011-09-16 00:10:00,8333,Don't believe everything on the net.
621959,MJL,2011-09-16 00:11:00,2427,"If it didn't go all the way to absolute zero and it was priced better than $211 and the battery life was better than 2wks, it could make a pretty awesome bait cooler to keep worms in."
621961,Terry,2011-09-16 00:13:00,14456, I found that funny too I will bet he has no idea what absolute zero is...
621963,Rod Caster,2011-09-16 00:18:00,5784," ..And don't believe everything on ""this is that""  Listen to some of the radio episodes. In one episode they discuss the failing public transit system in Wawa."
621970,thalweg,2011-09-16 00:33:00,112,"I'm amazed that anyone fell for this!!  Clearly a setup.  It just demonstrates how completely dense the ""dragons"" <sorry I gotta puke when I hear them called dragons> are!"
621975,lookinforwalleye,2011-09-16 00:57:00,4399,That is some funny stuff right there!!!
621979,Whitespinnerbait,2011-09-16 01:17:00,2038,Another 5 minutes of my life gone for good
621982,bucktail,2011-09-16 01:39:00,1857,I saw better stashes on the Beastie Boys in there video Sabotage!!!!
621992,Lunatic,2011-09-16 02:13:00,536,"wig,big glasses,fake mustache,nothing about this is real. ive watched the show many times before and never seen such a farce."
621995,Rod Caster,2011-09-16 02:29:00,5784,"  I'm amazed too! ""This is That"" is a CBC production... as is ""Dragon's Den"".  Watch or listen to the other radio episodes on the link I provided. In another episode they highlight a guy who commutes 120 hours per week from Calgary to Vancouver for work."
621997,irishfield,2011-09-16 02:32:00,26272,Was it Phil.. was it Phil...
622003,Roy,2011-09-16 03:05:00,13728,Looks like Bill Gate's less gifted brother.  Can't believe the crap on television now. It was bad enough 20-30 years ago but now it's just dead.
622052,johnnyb,2011-09-16 13:14:00,3413,I got the impression that the Dragons were in on it....the guy kind of looks like the host of This is That....could just be a little stunt they're pulling....
622057,Rod Caster,2011-09-16 13:28:00,5784, Your onto something Johnny.
622059,Harrison,2011-09-16 13:31:00,2202," Ha! Would of been a lot easier if we had of went out as a total farse like that guy from this and that.  I am nervous if we get aired.  They show 5 mins, but we filmed for close to an hour.  They can make those 5 mins look anyway they want with that much material. You sign a contract basically saying they can make you look good, ok, or absolutely ridiculous.  It is their choice, we are at their mercy."
622466,lplp,2011-09-18 14:17:00,83,"You think it was a bad idea,, i was going to see if he needed a supplier come dec. jan, feb,,, i can make them in my backyard and supply hoepefully limitless snowballs for him,, if that fails i can go to the areanas and get the piles at back .I was thinking maybe a dollar a snowball ,i can probable make up to 200 an hour ,."
622468,Rod Caster,2011-09-18 14:25:00,5784,"  I'll give you $50,000.00 for 51% of your snowball supplier buisness.  The real money is in reproducing that 6 volt battery that cools things to absolute zero or -273 degrees celcius.  From our atlantic salmon to our pacific salmon...This is That. hahaha."
622726,ccmtcanada,2011-09-19 02:34:00,7971,Sooo.....  A kid in Africa sees this at the bargain price of $211.  Throws 6 snowballs and then what???
