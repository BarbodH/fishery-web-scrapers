622406,mercman,2011-09-18 03:48:00,7054,"Brush fillets with kraft chicken and rib BBQ sause(i use Cattle Boyz) place on tinfoil(shiny side in) sprinkle with Parmesian cheese,place a Scallion on each fillet Close tinfoil loosely around fillets Bake at 325 for 20-25 minutes serve on a bed of rice.Pour the excess juice over the rice too."
622419,Rod Caster,2011-09-18 06:04:00,5784,"Mix Brocolli, tomatoes and an oil based salad dressing (like sun dried tomato)  in a frying pan and heat on medium until the brocolli is half soft.  In a second frying pan melt two or three tbsp's of butter and dip the filets (both sides) in the hot butter. Right away, sprinkle some cajun or lemon pepper (or other) spice on both sides of the filets. Let the filets cook, flip them only once after spicing them.  Make rice.  Place the filets on the rice, then smother with the tomato/broccoli sauce.  10 minute healthy gourmet"
622429,Billy Bob,2011-09-18 10:31:00,5865,"Use whatever spices or BBQ sauces you prefer....but put on a cedar plank...place in over at 300 degrees and bake for 18-20 minutes...remove from oven and throw away that stinken bass and eat the board...then go catch some tasty fish, like perch, walleye or crappie...  Seriously, Mercman's recipe sounds good to go...but so does Rods.."

622484,mercman,2011-09-18 15:42:00,7054," I think you may be right Skipper  I'm 1hour from Cornwall, and spent the day there fishing Carp and Walleye with Mike. Awesome little town"
622524,adolson,2011-09-18 17:57:00,783,"I cook my bass the same way I cook my pike, which is the same way I cook my walleye - heat a bit of oil in a frying pan, put the fillets in, flip once and immediately season with fresh ground pepper and seasoning salt. Simple, but I love it.  I have some garlic & butter fish crisp my brother gave me, and I use that sometimes, too. It's good, but I prefer my other way. I might give a couple other ideas here a try sometime, just for variety."
