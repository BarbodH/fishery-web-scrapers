622739,mistaredone,2011-09-19 03:41:00,913,So im heading to Lake of bays for an extra long weekend and I wanna chase some skis.  The closest lake I know of that has muskies would be Kash.  Just wondering if someone could point me to a good or free boat launch for the lake or if anyone has any other lake suggestions please PM me.  Thanks
