622331,Roy,2011-09-17 20:53:00,13728,Marcum getting closer to the humminbird. Does this mean that Marcum is having quality control problems?
622351,whitbyboatguy,2011-09-17 22:56:00,130,You forgot a category: I think I am going to sell my fl8 vex this year and trade up......  to a Hero video camera for use in this fall or next spring. I have determined that ice fishing sucks.
622373,Fishnwire,2011-09-18 00:30:00,983,"I used to drool over other fisherman's LX-5s...when I got one I thought I'd never suffer ""ice-fishing-sonar-envy"" again.  I guess I was wrong."
622377,Fisherman,2011-09-18 01:03:00,7201,"You forgot the X67C or was that by reason that once you have one, then the rest aren't all that great?"
622497,phatpelkey,2011-09-18 16:32:00,78,"i traded up for this winter, went from a fl 18 to a fl 22 cant wait to use it"
622676,Jds63,2011-09-18 23:56:00,1365,"Still like my H bird ice 45, but this LX-7 looks pretty cool  "
622690,babaganoush,2011-09-19 00:55:00,105, Why would you trade in the fl18 to a fl22. Isn't the fl22 a shallow water machine?
622692,phatpelkey,2011-09-19 01:07:00,78,how is it shallow water unit?
622694,BillM,2011-09-19 01:12:00,17367,I love my 747c Humminbird in the portable ice pack.  So much fun to watch those lakers and whities in colour
622705,miller,2011-09-19 01:41:00,223, i believe it only has depth ranges up to 60ft or something of that sort when the other models go much deeper.
622708,babaganoush,2011-09-19 02:02:00,105,  Exactly. fl20 would be a much better option after the fl18
622723,beginner,2011-09-19 02:32:00,542,"I was about to get fl22 but the store where I was about to buy it told me that its more likely built for shallow water and cant fish more than 60ft so he suggested me fl18 is the right way to go, for deeper fishing....Most likely for every depth..  and it runs great, ruin every signal around you... lolz"
622743,phatpelkey,2011-09-19 05:33:00,78,"well where i fish im lucky to find 20 feet of water and thats on the river, the lake is like 8-18 feet lol so im good to go"
