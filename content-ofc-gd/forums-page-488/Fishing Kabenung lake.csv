619857,anders,2011-09-09 14:29:00,1168,"the lake can be a great lake.  Make sure you bring your GPS as it is a big lake with lots of bays and fingers and rocks, LOT OF ROCKS!!  The smallmouth bass have exploded and the walleye fishing is still good.  Just be careful that you dont leave your motor on rocks."
