Ryan picked me up in Cambridge at 4:45 and we headed to the Credit to try and get some salmon at the mouth.      We started out trolling spoons for a bit and chatted away with no luck      Ryan's dad decided to switch to a Live Target Smelt and 5 minutes later FISH ON!!!        Shortly after it was time to hit Ontario Place for Facts of Fishing Kids Day. The amount of kids was insane. Here is a pic of the kids running after the gates opened.    My plan was to take a ton of pictures throughout the day but I only had time to take a few pics. It was good to see the smiles on all the kids faces    There were Shimano rods and reels to give away to the first 400 kids and they were gone in 40 minutes  If anyone has any pics from the day, throw them up."

622382,danbouck,2011-09-18 01:34:00,4380, I would rather not discuss the 30 or so boats up to 30 feet running wide open IN THE RIVER and almost capsizing everyone else!!!

622781,The Urban Fisherman,2011-09-19 12:39:00,2050,"Thanks Buddy!  This was a special trip for me as I've been trying to get my dad out fishing for chinny's for at least 5 years!  Finally the stars aligned... he was able to come down, the weather was good for my little boat on the big lake and the salmon were staging...  She was a dark fish but fought like a champ and got the old man's heart pumping with jumps and runs galore! Dan already posted his fish hold... here he is asking me if I want to see what fish slime feels like?? lol    wish we could have gotten Dan into his first Chinook to but at least he got to net one!! And what a net man I tell ya!    I figure we're even now though for the perch spots he gave me this spring!  Here's a few more pix....     And some water in the bottom of the boat after getting swamped from the idiots who were on plane before they even got out of the river mouth!   Hope you all have a great week at the office!  Cheers, Ryan"
