621859,bigbuck,2011-09-15 20:04:00,2449,"Tomorrow morning I'm off to HH to pull my boat out and head over to Bobcaygeon for our annual Muskie tourney/pig roast/lamb roast. I haven't had a chance to wash lures much this summer so I'm looking forward to a hardcore muskie weekend. Lures for the weekend include a couple bucktails, cowgirl or 2, hellhound and pulling a believer. Let's see if I can tie into 1 or 2. Last year while fun was a skunkfest along with boat damage so this year can only be better."
621861,Rizzo,2011-09-15 20:09:00,4754,"go get em! Make sure you let us know how you do, I'm hoping to get to Pigeon one or 2 more times this year, things are starting to heat up!"
621863,lew,2011-09-15 20:16:00,12766,"Hey Bruce, my daughter and I are fishing the top of Pigeon on Saturday, you guys gonna be on Pigeon all weekend or you moving around ??"
621926,Rizzo,2011-09-15 22:39:00,4754,"those hellhounds sure are perty aren't they and have a great side to side action. Bought a few of them custom painted ones at the Odyssey in April (Bare Bones)...now the bad news, all I've ever caught on one is a big ol pickerel who thought he was a musky. I set the hook on the thing and it felt like I was reeling in a deflated soccerball. You wouldn't believe how often I am disapointed by a 7 or 8 pound pickerel over the course of the summer. My buddy has seen me catch all kinds of em, he almost comes to expect it from me when we fish together. A big sledge is another great pickerel bait if you can believe it, and up near nogies, I caught a dandy on a 5 oz. nitro glider bait"
621952,bigbuck,2011-09-15 23:57:00,2449,"Lew, I'm staying at my buddy's trailer at Pigeon Hollow. We will be around the top of the lake. You still have the same cell #?? Prolly not though. Anyways, I will keep an eye out for ya. I'm in my beige Larson fishn ski."
622041,bigbuck,2011-09-16 12:45:00,2449,"Rizzo, I'd be happy to catch something for the dinner table or to USE AS BAIT for the big fish with teeth. I like the Hellhound cuz I've learned how to work it, I'm waiting to get out with Lew so I can learn the art of the Suick."

622045,lew,2011-09-16 12:58:00,12766," Fraid your too late Bruce, I no longer uses Suicks.  I pretty well got away from them a couple years back in favour of the Sledge. A similar bait to a Suick but it puts alot more fish in the boat.  I've still got a box of them though for whenever I tire of Sledges   :lol:"
622053,Andy,2011-09-16 13:19:00,330,
622076,F_ast,2011-09-16 14:49:00,154,I have a hard time finding Sledges.  Where are you guys getting them from.... Lew?
622087,lew,2011-09-16 15:14:00,12766," It's been a couple years since I bought any, but my last batch came from Stacey Ash at Pro Tackle.  http://www.protacklemuskyshop.com/cataloguetackle.php?td=type&idd=&display=Jerk Bait&offset=25"
622088,sconceptor,2011-09-16 15:22:00,146,"I just did my Kawartha trip there and one day on Balsam.  Fishing was slow, but first fish was a nice 47incher which christened my new 44x40 Frabill folding powerstow nicely.  The net made it very easy to handle the big fish without much stress or need to take them out of the water for anything other than a few quick photos.  Cut the line, shake out the hooks, remove the bait, and no worries of being injured or hurting the fish.  Two more fish, one was 31 and the other released without much attention as it was about 26inches, but it did the best jumps I've seen in a while.  Bass/Eye guys found the season slowed things down good.  One comment was spots they've been catch fish constantly at have shut down....they went 2 days without when I was there.  Balsam was slow with a strong south west wind blowing strongly past Ant Is. to the long point, and we only raised two skis.  Caught one bass.  Raised a small ski just infront of the PP launch before pulling out.  If I were a guide, I'd be trying my hardest to get GRIM REAPER lures to support me!!!!!  They are such sweet high quality lures which always do well for me!  The lady who's camp I was at thought I should've killed the big fish, as it doesn't reproduce and eats too much.....I thought that was funny!"
622110,slightlyhuman,2011-09-16 16:52:00,29,"I grew up on pigeon, actually got out last weekend from the parents place but got skunked, I went up by the south east end of boyd island. But I've heard good things coming from further south on the lake this year, just north of the 2 big sand beds. I've had some strange encounters with some by my parents house as well, east side of the lake by cadigans camp where that big rice bed is. its shallower and loggy and I've hooked into some there and seen even bigger ones (once had one following me while I was snorkeling)  good luck!"
622129,jimmer,2011-09-16 19:23:00,2730,Hope the pig and lamb taste good! My friends were there last weekend for a muskie and walleye 4 day trip. I asked him how it went and he said the the food and beer were great.
622234,bigbuck,2011-09-17 03:26:00,2449,The lamb was awesome and the beer ice cold but this kid is turning in soon. Gotta mount the trolling motor and get the batteries in place early in the morning.
622267,Rizzo,2011-09-17 12:18:00,4754,"so jealous. maybe keep a lambchop as the ""11th hour bait""...if you don't know what this means check youtube for ""musky hits chicken"""
622269,lew,2011-09-17 12:30:00,12766," Muskies luv chickens Roger, all different colours of chickens   I'm outta here in an hour  "
622273,Rizzo,2011-09-17 12:40:00,4754,"good luck Lew/Buck! I'm stuck at the in-laws while the wife goes shopping so no fishing for me, I'll live vicariously thru you guys"
622851,Billy Bob,2011-09-19 16:35:00,5865, So.....how was the fishing...
623004,Rizzo,2011-09-20 00:03:00,4754,ditto...lets hear the details even if its lure washing
623135,bigbuck,2011-09-20 14:08:00,2449,"Oh yeah, the fishing, forgot about that. On Sunday, we had an East wind come in and it quieted things down quite a bit. I got a little dink that was about 20 inches. Yesterday, I was fishing in another tourney out of Green Acres Campground with a bunch of Americans and I had a nice 40 inch class fish hit at boatside, did a jump right out of the water and off he went and that was it for me. 1 for 2. We had a great time, lots of food, drink and merriment. Good to get together with friends."
623136,lew,2011-09-20 14:15:00,12766,"Even a 20""er is better than that white striped citter Bruce"
