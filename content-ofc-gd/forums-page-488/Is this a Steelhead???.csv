622703,danjang,2011-09-19 01:36:00,148,Chinook
622704,ccmtcanada,2011-09-19 01:38:00,7971,I'd say Chinook Salmon...the black around the mouth is the giveaway.  Steelhead mouths are white.  Nice fish regardless!!!!
622707,beginner,2011-09-19 01:54:00,542,yup chinook
622710,BillM,2011-09-19 02:08:00,17367,Definitely a chinnie.
622712,northernpike56,2011-09-19 02:09:00,717,yea salmon for sure
