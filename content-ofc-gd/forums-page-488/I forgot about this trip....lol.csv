Anyway...i went to a local pond to get some walleye for the table. Lots of jackfish in this lake, but lots of nice walleye too.   Spinners and jigs with minnows and/or nightcrawlers were the bait, fish holding near...but not in...tall cabbage in 12 FOW.    <iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/r14cHQa0E_g"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>          "
