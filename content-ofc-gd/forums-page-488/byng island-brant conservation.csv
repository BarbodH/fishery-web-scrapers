622034,Garry2Rs,2011-09-16 12:16:00,1425,"I used to fish at Dunnville.  The fish are moving up from the lake. To me, it make sense to be close to the lake. Lots of people fish from shore, below the dam, on both sides of the river. If you have a boat, you can fish all the way out to Lake Erie. I had good luck down near Fish Master's place...close to the break wall. My best trolling lure was a Baby Bass Rattlin' Rap. You need to hit bottom once in awhile with your bait, but if you are stuck on shore lures are snag prone.  If that's your situation, live minnows might be a better choice. Garry2r's"
622071,registerfly,2011-09-16 14:37:00,198,best bet for walleye is below the dam I've been told. will fish that section this weekend on my pontoon from Bean Park down.  Other than that you should be able to hit pike and smb. smb mainly.   
622289,northernpike56,2011-09-17 13:57:00,717,  thanks for the advice! I'm stuck on shore so I think I'll go down to fishmasters and get some live minnows to put on jigs
622402,Rich,2011-09-18 03:38:00,3927,Try also tossing chartreuse 'Big O' crankbaits. Rip them fast. Adding an elbow spinner to your jig may put the odds in your end as well.
622709,northernpike56,2011-09-19 02:07:00,717,"tried byng island tonight with minnows under a float and jigs tipped with worms and weight forward spinners and all I managed was 2 little channel cats, a pumpkinseed, and a rock bass  i think i'll have to get out to dunville next weekend"
