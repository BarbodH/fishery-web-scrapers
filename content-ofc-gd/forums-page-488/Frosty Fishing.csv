622361,Skipper D,2011-09-17 23:53:00,1970,"Hi Terry your dam right it was cold out there this morning , i left home north of the city at 5 and had to scrape the windshield off on the truck , i was up at the north end of noname bay for a while this morning but spent the rest of the day in noname bay out of the wind , just came back in a few minutes ago , glad to be home. For me it seemed the perch were no where to be found today but like you the bass were hitting real good , i took the camera with me and when i had a good fish to take a picture of the dam batterys were dead in the thing , the best one  i caught to day for a Bass had his nose toughing the bottom of a five gallon pail while his tail hung over the top of it , sorry with out having a picture to show this is the best way i can tell how big it was  . All in all it was not to bad of a day ........................... i better go clean dem fish ."
