623193,michigander fisherman,2011-09-20 19:24:00,64,"yes i have and now i have a list of about  four lodges i have to decide from. osullivans rainbow,shining tree camp,camp anjigami and green wilderness resort"
623195,michigander fisherman,2011-09-20 19:26:00,64,also happy day lodge
623199,solopaddler,2011-09-20 19:49:00,8605,O'Sullivan's Rainbow and Happy Day are in an entirely different stratosphere compared to your other choices.  They're also both very popular and booked far in advance (for good reason).  Between the two Happy Day has superior cabins and good fishing on a big beautiful lake.  O'Sullivan has adequate cabins and amazing fishing on a big beautiful lake.
