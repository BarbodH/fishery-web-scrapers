622454,whitbyboatguy,2011-09-18 13:18:00,130, I did not read the rules but I thought that prefishing was normally against a tournament rules?

622699,mbac31,2011-09-19 01:26:00,904,Pre fishing is not against tournament rules. I will have spent some time on the franny this year pre fishing for sure.
622727,Roy,2011-09-19 02:36:00,13728,Most tournaments include a prefishing schedule. It's usually held for a couple of days immediately prior to the actual tournament. B1 is no exception.
