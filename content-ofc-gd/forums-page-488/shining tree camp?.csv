622679,michigander fisherman,2011-09-19 00:07:00,64,im looking at shining tree camp for my group of 12 guys is it any good (as in fishing and cabins)
622689,nofish4me,2011-09-19 00:52:00,404,"If this is the place on Spanish River, have to take the ""Bud Car"", etc., I was going to go there this past spring. No bad reports on cabins and some have got bored fishing, as it was no problem catching fish."
622861,Terry,2011-09-19 17:28:00,14456,well they have enough cabins to hold 12 guys and you can bring your own boats if you want  the fishing can be tough......but have had days where I caught 100 fish.....  the back lakes can be great but I don't know if that camp has boats on the back lakes  I know bay wolf camp does
623003,michigander fisherman,2011-09-20 00:02:00,64,Yeah it looked like a nice place
623011,the spirit of fishing,2011-09-20 00:14:00,141,"I've been going with our group to that Camp for the past 10 years. The cabins are clean and comfortable and the owners are great. They do not have boats on back lakes however they do have boats available to rent and will allow you to use their trailer and boat to fish another lake if you'd like. There are countless lakes to choose from in the immediate area if that interests you. All of us are from the Bay of Quinte area and there have been several personal best fish caught while in Shining Tree,so there are large walleye and pike available. A couple things that has maintained our interest in the area is the available species we can target and being able to fish for a week and rarely see another boat.There are countless lakes to choose from in the immediate area if that interests you. I presume that if your looking at this camp you know Bass season is open year round North of Hwy 560 and smallmouth are typically very cooperative. Along with walleye and pike there are other lakes with trout available As Terry said you CAN have days where you need to hide to bait your hook and work to find them another day-that's fishing."
623013,michigander fisherman,2011-09-20 00:18:00,64,yeah usually at our old lodge all 12 of us could limit out on pike and walleeye
623018,Terry,2011-09-20 00:26:00,14456,"what does ""all 12 of us could limit out on pike and walleeye"" mean  daily? Weekly? or take home?  just curious what that means..."
623022,michigander fisherman,2011-09-20 00:34:00,64,sorrry haha i probabley should have mentioned that. we are from michigan so for a week trip we could catch enough for all 12 of us to take home the limit of pike and walleye on a sportsmans license. also we were able to have atleast one shore lunch
623025,solopaddler,2011-09-20 00:38:00,8605,  Hope that wasn't your total catch for the entire week. 48 walleyes caught to take home is pretty sad for a week of fishing.  That's a good morning at most places.
623026,Terry,2011-09-20 00:39:00,14456,well you should be able to do that at shiningtree  I thought maybe you meant daily and I don't think you could get 72 pike a day...LOL
623035,michigander fisherman,2011-09-20 00:57:00,64,"no we catch alot more and 72 pike a day, now that would be insane"
