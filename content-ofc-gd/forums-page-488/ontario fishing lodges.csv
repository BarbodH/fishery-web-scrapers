621843,michigander fisherman,2011-09-15 19:26:00,64,im looking for a fishing lodge in between or near wawa ontario and hornepayne or hearst coming from michigan through sault ste marie. the lodge must be able to accomadate up to 12 people and it has to be a drive in where you can bring your own boat.also no ridiculous rates and in terms of fishing at our old lodge in geralldton ontario that unfortunatley closed all 12 of us limited out on pike and walleye and we would like to do the same or close to the same in a 6 night stay
621847,Fisherman,2011-09-15 19:40:00,7201,Wonder if they closed because there were no more fish at cheap prices.
621851,Roy,2011-09-15 19:51:00,13728,A good selection of them HERE!
621870,solopaddler,2011-09-15 20:32:00,8605,"So your previous lodge was in Geraldton?  If you're willing to drive just a bit further to Nakina O'Sullivans Rainbow is an OUTSTANDING drive to location.  Huge, beautiful fish filled lake and outstanding lodge.  They have a boat in outpost camp on Dunn island that's fantastic.  Walleye fishing is on par with many fly in lakes. On the plus side there's also lakers and pike.  Highly recommended!  http://www.osullivansrainbow.com/   Also in Nakina is Lower Twin Lakes Lodge. Upper and Lower Twin lakes combined are over 15km in length, so it's quite large.  Camp is spartan but clean.  As far as the fishing goes check the board in early Oct for my report.  I'm headed up there at the end of Sept to try it for the first time.  The big advantage with Lower Twin, it's EXTREMELY cheap. If you're on a budget their prices are hard to beat.  http://www.lowertwinlakes.com/"
621872,michigander fisherman,2011-09-15 20:42:00,64,thanks it looks like a great place but theguys i go with are getting older and i dont think they want to drive very ffar anymore. we used to go to wintering lake resort on the road to terrace bay i think its called gold field road and the fishing was great
621883,solopaddler,2011-09-15 21:02:00,8605," Nakina's not that much further than Hornepayne, the area you were asking about.  Seriously, I believe you should at least consider O'Sullivan's. It's exactly what you're looking for. Can't stress this enough LOL!  If you're only doing one trip a year don't sell yourselves short by limiting your driving time by an hour or two.  Another option that looks intriguing at least to me is Northern Woods Lodge on the south end of Long Lake just N/W of Terrace Bay.  It's relatively new and seems to offer a good variety of fish as well as nice new cabins and boats/motors.  Someone on the board here posted a report from this lodge ealier this year and I filed it away for future reference.  http://www.northernwoodslodge.com/"
621998,michigander fisherman,2011-09-16 02:46:00,64,when i looked at o suliivans website though it didnt look liek they had a cabin for 12 people
622021,solopaddler,2011-09-16 09:42:00,8605," Right, 12 people. I think you'll have a hard time finding a cabin quite that large at most resorts.  O'Sullivan's cabins sleep either 8 or 4. If you went there you'd have to take one of each."
622658,michigander fisherman,2011-09-18 22:53:00,64,yeah thats why its so hard to find a place but i never thought of renting two cabins. if you go to http://www.winteringlakeresort.com/mainpage.html you will see how cheap it was.
622670,solopaddler,2011-09-18 23:35:00,8605,"Checked your link, yep they were cheap all right! Maybe that's why they sold the business.   Another worthwhile option for your group might be hopping on the train in the Soo or Hawk Junction and travelling to Oba lake.  Wood's Cabins on Oba lake has very good prices and seems like a really nice spot.  By all accounts pretty decent fishing as well.  Obviously here you'd have to rent 2 cabins side by side as well, but frankly that wouldn't deter me.  Put all the guys who snore in one and leave the rest in peace LOL!  http://www.woodscabins.com/"
622677,michigander fisherman,2011-09-19 00:04:00,64,yeah ive checked out oba lake but these guys are so freaking picky. they are like i want to bring my own boat thoough haha but maybe i can convince them
622687,solopaddler,2011-09-19 00:43:00,8605, Not sure how you'd fit your boat on the train.
