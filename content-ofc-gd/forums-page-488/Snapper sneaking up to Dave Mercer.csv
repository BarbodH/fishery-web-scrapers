I think if Dave had dipped his hand 2 inches to the left, he could have lost it.  Wow how lucky was that  its on here http://www.factsoffishing.com/"
622810,Roy,2011-09-19 14:12:00,13728,"Yes, it's posted on the board at the top of the page. We regularly get all of Dave Mercer's Facts of Fishing vids on the board here. Just look up...look wayyyyyyyyyyy up.  And thanks Dave."
622813,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2011-09-19 14:23:00,535,"I've had snappers break my stringer and steal my fish before. Annoying watching a snapper sitting in front of me, eating my fish.   He is pretty lucky. Would only take a split second to lose some fingers."
622938,Victor,2011-09-19 21:15:00,1609,yeah I saw that and shared it with a couple of my fishing buddies.  from now on I will torpedo all my fish back into the water
623007,Rizzo,2011-09-20 00:06:00,4754,Man what an ugly beast...turtle is pretty unsightly as well (sorry Dave had to do it)
623092,Jer,2011-09-20 10:37:00,1426,What impressed me the most...Dave did almost a full push-up to get up from the dock.
623151,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2011-09-20 15:15:00,535,"  He didn't push himself up, he just pushed the dock down."
