Wonderful weather, good friends and the dinner after the fishing was excellent.  Ron fished with Chris Giles today and they managed a great weight, to finish in second place. The fun of this event is that second place cleans fish for the dinner. Some walleye were donated by the anglers and after some complaining and beer the boys broke out the knives and clean up some fish.   They also won big fish for the day.    Good job on the fishing and I didn't have any bones in my walleye fillets."

Fishing was tough out there on Saturday, we got 7 bites for the full day! Just fortunate they were good bites for 2 of them.  Cheers, Ron..."
