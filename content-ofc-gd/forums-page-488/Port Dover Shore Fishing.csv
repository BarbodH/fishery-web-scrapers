622945,Adam Delves,2011-09-19 21:47:00,28,Looking for some help here. My kids and I just started fishing this summer. I'd like to take them and myself to the next level by catching and cooking our fish. Being in Hamilton we are not taking any fish from Lake Ontario home. Would really appreciate any suggestions on where we could fish that is kid friendly (not a bridge high above the water or over a large railing). The kids are 6 and 3 and both very excited about fishing. I understand that a favorite spot is special and may not want to be shared. I'm looking really more for a general idea of where we are able to park the car and throw in a line. Thanks.

You never know what you'll get there at this time of year. Park right at the fishing spot, bench to sit on, food vendors nearby."
622962,danbouck,2011-09-19 22:36:00,4380,Rich is the expert down there. Not sure if you can still fish the rocks by the coast guard but that was always a good perch spot
622974,Adam Delves,2011-09-19 23:05:00,28,That's great info. Next dumb question. If and when we catch some perch do I club it before putting on ice or just put them in the cooler?  I'm such a newbie.
623008,smally21,2011-09-20 00:07:00,993,no clubbing necessary. dump them in the bucket and ice em for the drive home.  port maitland will hold perch for a little while as well as dover. same style of pier fishing
623021,Adam Delves,2011-09-20 00:32:00,28,Awesome. Little easier for the kids.
