622905,manitoubass2,2011-09-19 19:34:00,11391,Sorry to hear. Always sucks losing friends
622906,bushart,2011-09-19 19:34:00,2628,Sorry to hear that man  There's not many vets from that era left now
622908,mercman,2011-09-19 19:37:00,7054,Sorry to hear that John....Not many witnesses of that part of history left to help us remember Heros all........  
622918,Handlebarz,2011-09-19 20:17:00,3790,Sorry to here this John do you know if he had told his story on the WWII web site? What was his name?
622925,NAW,2011-09-19 20:38:00,4022,I'm sure you enjoyed many stories about his past.  Things you will never forget.  Sorry for your loss man.
623002,Rizzo,2011-09-20 00:02:00,4754,where was your neighbour from John?
623010,johnl,2011-09-20 00:12:00,197,"I never really asked him about his past because i was just a young neighbour and didn't want to bother him , although i've heard he liked talking about it we moved in just before i turned two so i knew him my whole life.I;m not sure if he put his info on that ww2 website."
623014,Rattletrap2,2011-09-20 00:18:00,1652,"Sorry for your loss John! I always enjoyed hearing the stories from my Wife's Grandfather about WW1. I had heard most of them several times, but he had earned the right to tell them as often as he pleased.  I'm sure your neighbour was a good man, and probably had many memories of WW2, whether or not he chose to recant them."
623099,Skipper D,2011-09-20 11:50:00,1970,Sorry for your lost 0ver this way too John  and to anothter HERO to which we owe our freedom . Let us never forget .
623150,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2011-09-20 15:12:00,535,"  That's a sad fact. I remember as a kid a few veterens from the first world war visited our school, now there's not many WWII veterens left.  Sorry about your loss. It doesn't matter how old a person is, it always hurts losing them. But he obviously made an impression on you so he'll always be remembered."
