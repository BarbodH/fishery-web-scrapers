622496,mercman,2011-09-18 16:25:00,7054,"For us humans it was an incredibly beautiful day on Lake St.Francis yesterday, but it made for a tough day of fishing.Mike (Musky Mike) invited me up to experience Carp fishing for the first time. Arrive at his place by 9.15am, and after picking up a day licence, we set off to a place he had scouted and baited the day before. We could see the Carp through crystal clear waters, not a ripple, and not exactly ideal for catching them either.If we could see them, then they sure could see us. We spent 2 or 3 hours there and i at least caught one.Small in Mikes standards, about 16 lbs, but to me,it was like holding a bucking bronco by the nose and going for a ride. Carp....engineered like no other fish!!! Mike was getting a bit Antsy, and when he asked if i wanted to go get some Eyes, well....he didnt have to ask twice.Quick lunch, short drive, and  Mikes buddy Zach came along with us, and caught the biggest fish of the day. I think it was his PB, 28in fat walley, easily 8-9 lbs  Was a nice sunset, and we fished till 9pm before heading in.   All in all, a very successful day on the water with good friends.We caught 11 really nice sized walleye, and i brough home my limit of 2-3 lb eating fish.    Thanks for another great day on the water and sharing your knowledge with me Mike   Tite lines  Paul"

622531,mike rousseau,2011-09-18 18:09:00,4661,i had fun paul... nice report.... and nice pictures...
622536,johnnyb,2011-09-18 18:24:00,3413,Looks like a fantastic day out....I'll take eyes over carp *spits on ground* any day!
622538,misfish,2011-09-18 18:24:00,29133,"Nice fish there Paul,and nice to see OFC members getting out."
622541,mike rousseau,2011-09-18 18:28:00,4661,"  lol  when i tell my buddy about my big carp catches...  he says  ""its like shooting rats at the dump... then bragging about it""  :lol:"
622558,mercman,2011-09-18 18:54:00,7054,"Thanks for the support guys  Ya, as was pointed out to me in the PM, I'm new to all this.But i can and do accept constructive criticism, just not blatant hurtful insults. You will note that i edited my post. It was because i never keep track of number caught, only number kept, and i posted the wrong number caught (Angler exageration? )"
622581,beginner,2011-09-18 20:03:00,542,nice walleye mercman... congratz on a great day fishing!.. that PB sure thing is a beast!.. lolz
622593,Rod Caster,2011-09-18 20:41:00,5784,"Big fish all around boyz! Again, you make my fish look like minnows"
622596,mercman,2011-09-18 20:48:00,7054,"  RC. If you ever get down this way, I'd love to get out with you and Mike for walleye. We would have a blast.  Paul"
622601,solopaddler,2011-09-18 20:52:00,8605,  Now that's funny.   Nice fish guys.
622614,Billy Bob,2011-09-18 21:11:00,5865,"You and Mike are really racking up the pickerels eh.....  I think you're kicking some major   here....probably MANY jealous members, including this Redneck.  Now what was your address again....  ...need to follow you boys on the next trip out...  Of course knowing ""where"" is only 1/3 of the puzzle as seasoned vets realize...presentation is sometimes a lot more important then many realize...yesterday I gave some good minnows to 3 lost souls on Lake Erie...but I'm doubting they did all that well because I watched them and their presentation is not what is need to catch very finicky jumbo Lake Erie perch....It's quite evident that Musky Mike has fine tuned his presentation for the current conditions....NICE GOING...  Bob"
622619,limeyangler,2011-09-18 21:17:00,5204,Nice going guys. Some really nice fishes there....MIke...you da man...putting an awesomeness goodly shedload of fish in yer boat.  I gotta agree with Billy Bob....location is only part of the puzzle. As long as its not a small pond naming the body of water is all good in my opinion.
622625,Rod Caster,2011-09-18 21:25:00,5784, Thanks for the invite! That would be a fine opportunity for me. I'll send you a PM (a nice one) if I have travel plans in your direction.

622769,skeeter,2011-09-19 12:30:00,1907,Nice walleye's Paul!! Great report. But why did it take 5 bottles of water and a box of kleenex to filet 1 fish?
622779,mike rousseau,2011-09-19 12:38:00,4661,  He tried using the bottled water to keep em alive... Then when that didn't work... He needed the tissue for the tears running down his cheek...  But then he remembered how hungry he was... Then he needed the tissue for tears of joy... Lol
622782,Squid,2011-09-19 12:43:00,1656,"Nice pictures and a good sized walleye to boot. Going to the Franny on Friday, can't wait and I hope that the big girls are hungry."
622828,mercman,2011-09-19 15:19:00,7054, Hey !!! Do i tell you how to build barns????  It used to take 5 beers and a bag of Fritos.

Got a hog myself. A bit thin but long. 28.5 inches. I'll get some pics up soon. I was worried about the cold nights but looks like they woke them up!
