Of course I had to open all the boxes and fondle them gently.lol  I was looking at Curado and Chronarch. Played with them for awhile,and then I asked if he had any 2011 models left. He pulls out the 11 models of the Chrones and they are 340.00 (101D7) the 12's are 220.00. I play with them some more?????  We start discussing the price changes, and I'm starting to really like the old 11's more and more. He said everone is buying the new ones and not intersted in the old because of the huge drop in price. And he is gonna get screwed on his remaing stock, or something like that. By now I'm done playing with the 12's and there all back in the boxes and were talking the 11 Cronarchs only.  After we exchanged words some more I told him I was interested in two of them if we could make a deal. We made a deal in like 20 seconds. Two Chronarchs for 5 bones. I think I got a good deal. And if not I got the last of the real Chronarchs. Sorry dudes but the new ones just feel strange. I asked him how much, for the bait and he said good luck fishing."
