I need to find somone who will take out 2 guys for some fishing.  I am not very good at finding charters other than othose that take 6 or 8 guys at a time.  We are just into a relaxing day or 2 fishing for some perch, bass and/or walleye and don't need a humungous boat."

Just keep heading into the bay until the weeds become sparse, thats where you start fishing. Anchor or drift, your choice.. but there's perch & bass everywhere."
