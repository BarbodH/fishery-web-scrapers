787849,Ron,2013-05-21 23:47:00,1683,"Too funny.  We had the same thing happen to us Saturday. that's the beauty of the new Terrova. Vertical jigging, hook a fish, fight fish and then move off while there is a barage of boats fighting to where you were.  Funny actually, you would see anchor rope in 100ft lengths going overboard and while they were getting set up to fish, I would set the anchor mode on and fish away."
787851,BillM,2013-05-21 23:50:00,17367,"Ron, anchor mode works wicked for crappies as well"
787888,msp,2013-05-22 01:43:00,1336,Looks like a lot of fun out there well done guys
788011,misfish,2013-05-22 18:11:00,29133,Saturdays looking like a good day to catch some more. What ya say Spincast? I have been granted the day off.
788024,Headhunter,2013-05-22 19:44:00,5703,Nice shootin guys! Some real nice fish there! Love that shirt Brian! HH
788026,Terry,2013-05-22 20:01:00,14456,"sure, I sell my boat and  he jumps ship pretty quick  lol"
788027,misfish,2013-05-22 20:04:00,29133," That there Joe,is one lucky shirt. I have caught lots of fish wearing that one. Still has last years bug juice on it. That crap dosent wash out.LOL"
788028,Terry,2013-05-22 20:10:00,14456,"as my boat is pulled away by the new owner, a tear comes to the eye    now the  till june 15, if no more delays"
788038,misfish,2013-05-22 20:35:00,29133,"Atleast you didnt get screwed around. Sold is sold,.Bring on the new bling,so it can get slimed."
788039,davey buoy,2013-05-22 20:41:00,5505,"It will hurt for a while Terry,but things will get better.  lol. Now just the wait.Hope the new boats on time!"
787511,misfish,2013-05-20 17:39:00,29133,"With late notice there was not going to be a Monday shift at work,I hooked up with my buddy for the last ride to laker grounds. I had  heard from a friend, (Andy) that down rigg,n with a pin was possible,and a blast. Just had to have yer eyes on the rod,as when the hit comes,you got to be fast. Well I tried it today. Terry thought I was mad,but I am always willing to try something different. So rig up the Raven meat stick,and freshly spool the SST2.  The set up. A simple elastic. Worked awesome.          The pics explain our 1/2 day outing. 11 for 12 in. 5 hours                 Last fish in the ole boat,and by Terry.Thats the way we ended our day.    Looking forward to slimming the new one bud.  I do believe you took my fish home BTW .  "
787515,danc,2013-05-20 18:09:00,4677,Looks like a lot of fun boys!!
787516,BillM,2013-05-20 18:11:00,17367,Nice Brian!  I am going to have to drag the boat down for some of that laker action soon.  Too busy chasing crappies and walleye up around my parents place.
787517,davey buoy,2013-05-20 18:12:00,5505,"Great day guys!!!!,how was the pin compared to the regular setup?"
787521,Terry,2013-05-20 18:54:00,14456,yup goodÂ  time on the water bon voyage sylvan         
787522,spincast,2013-05-20 19:02:00,3279,Nice way to say good bye to the old ride. lots if fun there
787523,misfish,2013-05-20 19:24:00,29133," Except for the fact that theres no drag Dave,it,s basically mooching,IMO. Today made up for the lack of river fish this spring. I wouldnt recommend it,if you are solo..Boat control and a hit,,,,,big mess. I was watching that rod like a hawk. LOL  On a funny note,I noticed that Terrys line was wrapped around the tip of his rod. While he was fixing this problem,the screen lit up with fish. Off went my rod.Fish on and in. Still not done getting himself rigged again,I procceded to set up,and wouldnt ya know it,the screen lights up again. OOPS,off goes the rod.LOL He did manage to get the last two,to make the game close.  Always fun fishing with Terry. Were like, Loral and Hardy..Abbott and Costilo."
787524,misfish,2013-05-20 19:25:00,29133, Whats the weather look like for next weekend dude?

787541,misfish,2013-05-20 20:20:00,29133,"Were you guys jig,n?  I said to Terry,who else has a lund with a Verado that stands out like that. If it was you guys,we nailed two fish,right near yas.LOL  Looking forward to the post."

787591,Moosebunk,2013-05-20 23:35:00,3970,"Now that's wicked right there fellas.  Would be gnarly pinnin' lakers that way. lol.  Only Andolph the Grey would think of that wizardry. lol.  Glass on the lake, and plenty lakers from under that glass.  Nice!"
787786,Leecher,2013-05-21 21:47:00,7832,Great job guys   Some of these greasers have shoulders    Was Terry using the same setup as you B??
787787,Terry,2013-05-21 21:50:00,14456,"no, a spinning reel I don't allow  pins on my boat,  he smuggled it aboard.....lol"
787791,misfish,2013-05-21 21:58:00,29133, Are you still retying that mess bud? OOPS fish on. LMAO   A fitting name for the old man.
787795,Terry,2013-05-21 22:03:00,14456,"now he's an old man....lol   yeah if I wasn't trying to get that twist off my tip, you would not be 2 fish  ahead of me..dang they came fast"
787796,Leecher,2013-05-21 22:05:00,7832, Ahhh OK... LOL
787804,misfish,2013-05-21 22:29:00,29133," That was due to my internal GPS,that was embeded in my brain. I told ya so.LOL"
787809,fishindevil,2013-05-21 22:36:00,6254,Some nice fish guys !!!! Great report & pics !!!!
787834,Ron,2013-05-21 23:22:00,1683,Nice to see ya'll getting out there. Was it busy on the Lake?
787836,Terry,2013-05-21 23:27:00,14456,"nothing like  an ice fishing day, I only had to change course for two other boats  oh and the anchored boat that came running over and  dropped anchor when they saw us catch a fish...maybe 20  boats in a 1 mile area"
787838,misfish,2013-05-21 23:29:00,29133," Boats were pretty much scattered. Then we had guys following. This is no lie.We had two boats get 15-20 ft from us. I guess when yer using 13 ft rods,and standing at the back with hook ups,it,s going to happen.  This happen last year as well,when we were in Pauls boat."
787841,misfish,2013-05-21 23:33:00,29133,You forgot about the starcraft and the smoker that came by after the two hook ups bud.LOL
