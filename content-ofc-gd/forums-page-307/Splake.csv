788269,mikdor,2013-05-24 02:18:00,109,Has anyone been out for splake lately. How deep would they be this time of the year. Thanks Mike
788300,Joeytier,2013-05-24 12:19:00,3990,They could be in 2 feet...or they could be in 40 feet.  Depends on a lot of things so I would be doing a lot of trolling and covering water
