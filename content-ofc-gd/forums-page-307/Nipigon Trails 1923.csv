787532,Guidofisherman,2013-05-20 19:37:00,206,My favorite old time video. My grandmother worked as a cook at the Nepigon Lodge featured in the video around 1919. Great reminder of a bygone era. Brookies just around the corner.
787533,danc,2013-05-20 19:46:00,4677," What's most amazing to me Al is the fact that we can, and do, run our motorized boats from Superior to Lake Nipigon today over these same waters because of the hydro dams. Sure wish I could have fished it in the era of the video. Can you imagine?"

Godly place... yes!  Somewhere below that deep cold current at Virgin Falls, surely the echo of those rapids must still roar.   Eight more years..."

787893,Ron,2013-05-22 02:01:00,1683,I can just imagine how many times the record would have been broken for the Brook Trout if it was still unspoiled and natural.  We human beings sure do know how to destruct a good thing.
