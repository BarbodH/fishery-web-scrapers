Plan A- only 300m down the access road, a washout, they got the culvert in but hadn't back filled it yet. That was the end of Plan A    Plan B- about 4km in, another road closed    I pressed my luck, and tried anyways. There was some nasty areas and my 2 wheel drive was at risk of getting stuck    finally made it to the lake, it felt good to be in the canoe again and on the portages    no fish caught, but a great day, I had a shower that morning and was eaten alive by the blackflies all day, even on the water    Cam, Mac, Carston and me went searching out back lakes for future trips once bass season opens    here's shorelunch without the shore    I think we'll make the trip back here in a few weeks, it looked awesome    shorelunch with the shore this time    heading back, getting home well after dark, Carston has a great retro mullet, his next haircut for the summer will be an Apache    some other pics from the weekend  this is from Gull Lk, the flood has the lake littered with all kinds of debris, docks and chairs washed up everywhere    Mike (Solopaddler) Borger may recognize this place    not my most interesting report, thanks for checking it out"

My son hooked a couple on the first lake, but lost them, and we only had one bite on the second. The trout seemed to be off for some reason. Couldn't ask for better weather, or better company though! How were the bugs over your way? We had lots of blackflies, but they were mostly just buzzing.  S."
