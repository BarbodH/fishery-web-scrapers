785811,camillj,2013-05-11 02:52:00,1988,"Heh .. spent an hour under the cottage today too ... Pump was running but no water ... figured out the fittings had come loose and air was getting into the system so the water was running back down to the lake .. tightened em up ( a little plumbers tape for the fittings) and primed her up .. and presto .... (well not quite presto ... it DID take me an hour to figure out how it all worked - darn plumber never even returned my calls so I figured it was time to get ""handy"":)"
785827,Sinker,2013-05-11 04:02:00,8692,"I don't understand what your saying wayne.  Where do you get pressure from if the pump runs continuously?  Mine cycles on/off, and I've filled my pool as many times as you have I bet! I also water the gardens, and sometimes even the lawn.  I turn the water on, pressure starts to slowly drop at pump, pump kicks on at 20psi, no change in water pressure, pressure in tank rises to 40psi, pump shuts off(and cools), water is still running, pressure drops below 20psi, pump kicks on.  I'd say, while filling the pool, my pump kicks on for 5 mins(maybe not even that long) and when it shuts off, its stopped for 15mins. Pump doesn't even get warm.  Unless we're talking a different kind of pump, or set up, that's the only way it will work with a jet pump.  Correct me if I'm wrong.  S."
785829,irishfield,2013-05-11 04:07:00,26272,"Shane... you have to find a point in the output, that the pressure drops to kick the pump on and then the flow is such that while the pressure will then rise as the pump runs that it never reaches the cut off point. Saves wear and tear on both the pump and the pressure switch if the pump just keeps running. Something I learned many eons ago when I had a stupid neighbour attached to OUR well that would put put one sprinkler in her garden on leave it on all day, After she burnt out the second pump.. the line got cut!"
785831,Sinker,2013-05-11 04:13:00,8692,"So essentially your cyphoning water from your well through the pump?  Interesting.  I never would have thought that would work. Is there a trick to finding the ""sweet spot""? That muust take some trial and error?  Btw, I've never lost a pump, or pressure switch, and I've had all kinds of stuff happen where the pump has run for loooooong periods, a couple times with no water lol. Maybe I'm just lucky, but I'll take lucky over good any day  S."
785832,irishfield,2013-05-11 04:19:00,26272,"It's not syphoning, just pumping at a pressure that while mid range doesn't make the cut off point of the pressure switch. Easy to do with yard hydrants... that I can get the plus side of 10 GPM out of, but if using standard hose outlets you need two of them running to stop the pressure from rising enough to kick off the pump.  Just lucky to be on a good water supply here, on a 185 foot deep drilled well, that I can suck that amount of water per day out of the earth!"
785836,Sinker,2013-05-11 04:33:00,8692,"I'm going to try it the next time I'm running water.  Sorry for the ""Saga"", Meely, but there is some useful information here somewhere  S"
786008,Old Ironmaker,2013-05-12 14:48:00,8243,"We must be talking about 2 different types of pumps. No way a shallow well jet pump is going to get water out of a 185' deep well. I had a pressure demand pump, no pressure tank, ran continuously at 40 psi as long as a line was open, took it back as the pump running the entire time a shower was run or washing machine filled drove me nuts."
786023,Meely,2013-05-12 15:39:00,282,"No saga.....at all....... I appreciate all the info.  I had a quick look at the pump and it is in fact a ""Square D 30/50"". I had a quick gander at the Home Hardware and they are only 30 bucks or so.......I will get one as a back up but for now would like to know ....what can I use to clean the contacts? A file of some sort??  Thanks again!!  Meely"
786028,Old Ironmaker,2013-05-12 16:02:00,8243,Drop the 30 bucks and change the pressure switch.
786040,Sinker,2013-05-12 16:33:00,8692,"Yep, just change it Meely. You might get away with cleaning the contacts, but it will let you down again sooner than later. It will last you another 20yrs. When you puut it away, give the switch a light shot of WD, or oil.  S."
786042,Sinker,2013-05-12 16:34:00,8692,"If your set on cleaning it, a wire brush, or wheel, or sandpaper will clean it up, but if its fairly dirty(corroded) it might not ever work the same."
786107,Old Ironmaker,2013-05-12 21:44:00,8243,"I just realized this afternoon it's easy for me to suggest you change the switch, not so easy if you have never changed one.  I found this on youtube.com how to change a square D pressure switch for a water pump.    There are many other diy tips there as well for changing pressure switches.  Good luck, now go change the switch."
786115,aplumma,2013-05-12 22:31:00,6896,I still hold with replacing the switch. Filing the points can cause a hotspot if done incorrectly and cause the contacts to arc and weld themselves in the on position.   Art
787871,Meely,2013-05-22 00:50:00,282,"Well Kids,  I ventured up to the cottage on Saturday morning and managed to carefully yank out the old switch. Headed over to the local hardware store and bought an identical replacement switch and a new piece of plastic tubing. Managed to replace the switch with no problems at all. Flicked the breaker back on and then the light switch and away she went. Worked like a charm. She ran perfectly all day then at approx  10 pm.....I got the ""Hollar"" from someone who was in mid-lather in the shower. So, I sauntered back down to the pump-house, flicked the light switch off and then on again and away she went........  It appears the tank/lines is/are losing pressure somehow (gauge reads zero psi). I would think that once the pressure hits 30 psi, the pump should click back on. If I had a leak in the lines somewhere, I would think the pump would keep cycling on and off but it does not do that. To compound the problem, it only happens sporadically.......  So now what?? Do I take her out back into the bush and shoot her?   lol......  Could it be a problem with pressure in the tank?  Thanks again for any help,  Meely"
787878,Sinker,2013-05-22 00:59:00,8692,Weird.  Did you take a look at the light switch? Maybe its burnt out?  Is your pressure guage always reading zero? You might want to replace that as well.  That's all I'm coming up with right now.  S.
787880,Sinker,2013-05-22 01:05:00,8692,"To check the pressure in the tank, shut off the pump and run water until it stops. Get a tire pressure guage, and check the pressure in the tank, the same as you would a tire. It should be at 28psi.  I don't think that's your problem, but it doesn't hurt to check it. The tanks are known to lose pressure, aand ""flood"" themselves.  I think you have an electrical contact problem.  Next time it doesn't start up, see if the conacts are open or closed on the pressure switch. If they're closed, your not getting power from the light switch.  I'd replace the light switch anyways. Just cheap insurance. If its not working properly it could cause a fire. Better safe than sorry.  S."
787923,Woodsman,2013-05-22 04:32:00,1286,Is this a galvanized tank or a blue/beige one with a bladder? If it's a galvanized one try charging it with a compressor. It may be waterlogged.
788070,sofabed,2013-05-22 23:12:00,119,Does you switch have an overload device in it? It sounds like the O/l is tripping. It is reset by turning the switch on and off which would look like a regular light switch. If you take the cover plate off you should see a circular element between 2 of of the screws at each end of the switch. Always shut the power off before taking the cover off unless you know what your looking at. If you have a voltmeter you could test from the ground for voltage on each side of the switch on the wires. If you have voltage on both sides check the pressure switch next. But only do this if you know what your looking at
785225,Meely,2013-05-08 18:41:00,282,"Hello Gang,  As of late I have been having an issue with the water pump at the cottage. Most of the times it works normally and then there are times when we turn on a tap and get no water at all. I then walk over to the pump-house, flick the switch which kills the power to the pump then flick the switch back on again. After this.......away she goes. It is odd in that it does not do this all the time and it is very unpredictable.  Does anyone have any ideas as to what it may be?  Switch?  Also, does anyone know of anyone who may do house calls in the Bobcaygeon area? (It is hardwired in for now and it would be a bugger to have to yank it all out.....)  Thanks for any help.  Meely"
785231,davey buoy,2013-05-08 18:54:00,5505,"Does the switch have a reset on it when you turn it off and on?,If so your pump could be working to hard because of pump or motor problems.Intermittant problems can be hard to solve."
785238,Meely,2013-05-08 19:16:00,282,"No reset that I know of....... Once I flick the power back on....she fires right back up to the set pressure point, turns off and holds pressure like normal. Meely"
785241,Sinker,2013-05-08 19:32:00,8692,"Sounds like the contacts are worn out on your pressure switch, Meely. You should be able to get a new switch at most hardware stores, and install it yourself. Shouldn't take you more than an hour.  You might even get away with just cleaning the contacts off.  S."
785242,bigbuck,2013-05-08 19:32:00,2449,Could be the pressure switch isn't working correctly. Check the contacts in it for corrosion.....with the power off of course.
785255,Ice Fishing Ham,2013-05-08 20:32:00,83,"The problem might be in the pump switch you are turning off and on. The contacts in it might be burnt and opening and closing the switch re-seats them and there good for awhile.  To check this, next time it happens rather then cycle the pump switch turn the circuit breaker for the pump off and on. If the pump does not start by doing this go and cycle the pump switch, if the pump starts its a good chance its this switch. Hope this helps. One more thing if it is this switch replace it with one that is designed for motors."
785258,davey buoy,2013-05-08 20:46:00,5505,My thoughts exactly.
785262,aplumma,2013-05-08 20:52:00,6896,"Replace the squareD switch. It is the gray unit that the wire run into two from power and two to the pump. Look inside of the cover to see if it is 20/40 or a 30/60 switch (cut in cut out  pressure). Look carefully at the way it is wired before you take it apart if you wire it wrong you will ruin the new switch instantly and blow the breaker. I also advise you to replace the 3/8th X 6"" brass tube it is usually full of debris/scale and will effect the accuracy of the pump pressure.    Art"
785275,Chappee,2013-05-08 21:22:00,10,"You never did say if it was a jet pump or a submersible, i'm asuming it is a jet pump since it is at your cottage. You will only find a 6""x3/8 brass nipple on a submersible set up, on a jet pump set up you will find a 1/8 tube that runs from the pressure swich to the head of the pump checkit to see if it is plugged or the fitting going into the head of the pump. Another thing to do is when it happens next time carefully take the grey cover off the pressure switch when the power is on and see if the points are open or closed. If the points are closed and your pump is not running there could be a problem with that switch. Trouble shooting a pump is hard to do with out a multi meter."
785289,aplumma,2013-05-08 22:19:00,6896,You are correct Chappee thanks for the info. Shallow well pumps are very rare in my neck of the woods I haven't seen one in years and forgot to consider them in this answer. Art
785297,Fisherman,2013-05-08 22:45:00,7201,"Well that's some great info that I'll definitely store away.   I've got a shallow sandpoint for lawn watering, so far so good."
785303,Chappee,2013-05-08 22:51:00,10,Your a lucky man aplumma.... there is far to many of these jet pumps in my area. trouble shooting a deep well set up on a jet pump with a injector down the well can be a treat. A submersible pump is bar far a better system. 
785305,Meely,2013-05-08 22:55:00,282,"Sorry, perhaps I could have been a bit more precise ......  When I say switch, I have power running from a mini panel in my shed to a switch (like a light switch) that then runs to the pump. I use this light switch to turn the power off to the pump when I leave and on again when I go back up. I dont actually hit any switch on the pump (it is a jet pump) itself........  So, when the pump acts up or does not start, I turn the power off (from the light switch) then immediately flick it back on......at this point the pump fires up again and things are back to normal.  Thanks for all your responses.....  Meely"
785323,Sinker,2013-05-08 23:45:00,8692,"I still say swap out or clean up the pressure switch.  I assume this pumps water from the lake, and hasn't run much/ all winter?  Contacts are probably bunged up. A cleaning will probably do it, but they're cheap to replace, and easy to do. Most likely a 20-40psi switch, you can find them just about anywhere.  If you need anymore help with it, pm me and I'll send u my number, or get it from tony.  S."
785331,Meely,2013-05-08 23:53:00,282,"Thanks Sinker. You are correct in that the pump does draw from the lake. I also do remove it in the fall and store it at home in my basement all winter, then set it all up again in the spring. I will have a look at the switch (and take some pics) this weekend if I head up there.  Meely"
785344,Old Ironmaker,2013-05-09 00:58:00,8243,Change the pressure switch. Get a preset 30 psi on 60 psi off.
785491,aplumma,2013-05-09 18:03:00,6896,You have added a new element to this saga and that is unless the switch is a heavy duty light switch rated for 15 amps it could also be the issue. I would turn off the circuit breaker and remove the switch. Replace the switch with a heavy duty switch rated for the amp # on the fuse box for the pump. If it has a 15 on it it is a 15 amp fuse 20 etc. If after you do this it cuts out do not touch anything. Remove the cover off of the grey switch that is on the pump look to see if the contacts are open or appear closed. Look at the gauge if it still works and see if what the pressure reads. If the contacts are closed and there is less than 20 lbs of pressure tap the contacts with a non conductive item. If the pump comes on then replace the switch and replace or clear out the 1/8 tube.  If it does not come on then test for voltage at the switch with a multi meter. If you are not sure of how to do this stop and have someone who is come out and test for you.   Art
785543,Chappee,2013-05-09 21:42:00,10,Good advice Art
785631,steelhedrmatt,2013-05-10 09:16:00,278,"Check to see if your pressure tank is ""drowned"" This happened last year to us at the cottage. changed the switch, changed the breaker, ended up being the pressure tank. If you think it could be drowned, open the bottom valve and put a LITTLE air to it."
785661,Sinker,2013-05-10 13:28:00,8692,"Your pressure tank shouldn't have anything to do with it. You have a contact problem, either in your switch, or the pressure switch.  To check the pressure tank, turn off pump, run water until it stops flowing, then check pressuure in tank. It should be 2lbs less than your on pressure. (18 or 28lbs, depending on which pressure switch you have)  A drowned tank is common, but usually only causes reduced pressure to the system, not issues with the pump cycling on/off.  I'd bet my pay check its the pressure switch. Have you ever replaced it?  S."
785731,Meely,2013-05-10 20:27:00,282,"Sorry....... I didn't mean for this to turn into a ""Saga""......  Sinker, havent changed it in 15 years that I have had the place and who knows how long the old owners had it goin.......  I may as well just go and get a whole new switch and give her a try.....if it works .....Great! If not..... I have a feeling sooner or later I will need it anyways.....lol  Thanks to all......  Meely "
785739,Old Ironmaker,2013-05-10 22:08:00,8243,"While you're at it ask for a 30/60 that is set to shut the pump off after a certain period of time. That ensures you don't have a flood if you have a break in a line or leave the tap running and end up with a burned out pump that runs dry. I know you shut it off when you leave but a lot can go wrong when you aren't in the cottage to hear the pump running too long. I had a Swagelok fitting separate once in the middle of the summer and the pump shut down before we had a disaster in stead of a wet floor.  The last one I bought was an entire 30 bucks taxes included from Home Hardware.  If you are anything like me I had no idea how much a pressure switch costs when I had my first pump, heck I never knew there was such a thing, turn on the tap and water comes out. If the guy asked for $139.99 I wouldn't have had a clue when I bought my first foot valve."
785758,irishfield,2013-05-10 23:11:00,26272,"DANG, I'd never fill my pool with one of those... just finished putting about 10,000 gallons in it since yesterday, at 6pm, after removing the cover. Flow at a rate to turn on pump.. keep some pressure on it and never shut off. Yard hydrants are great.  As for the run, no run issue, I'm betting a file and some contact cleaner can fix it PDQ. Many of those switches.. the contacts are also replaceable vs doing any plumbing or wiring work."
785808,Old Ironmaker,2013-05-11 02:39:00,8243,"Irish, It doesn't work like that. It shuts down if it hasn't reached pressure setting. Filling your pool the pump will cycle to pressure max then to pressure min. If the pump runs continuously without hitting the off setting it will shut down. Get one."
785810,irishfield,2013-05-11 02:51:00,26272,"Exactly.. if you ever water your yard or garden from a well you don't want the pump kicking on and off.. on and off.. you set it for a flow that keeps the pump running at  a mid level continous pressure. The last thing you want is your pump kicking on and off pumping 10,000 gallons of water in a day. You want it to run continuous and what you are suggesting won't work for anyone watering their lawn or filling a pool in a matter that minimizes pressure switch cycles and pump damage."
