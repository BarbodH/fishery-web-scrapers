787733,ch312,2013-05-21 17:51:00,1590," firearms licenses are federal and not provincial which is why it's called the canadian firearms safety course. that said, one can simply opt to challenge the non restricted exam to obtain that license and then challenge the restricted exam afterwards (you need non-resticted before obtaining restricted) and you're good to go. taking either course is not mandatory to obtain either license, but the hunting course is mandatory to obtain your hunting license which must be acquired before taking the turkey hunting course.  most CO's apply common sense and if you're hiking or fishing with applicable gear and don't have any camo or hunting equipment they will not assume you're hunting. carrying a firearm in the bush does not imply you are hunting."
787735,ch312,2013-05-21 17:53:00,1590, many people who live in bear country claim more bears are getting killed since the cancellation of the spring bear hunt. the majority also resort to the SSS rule to avoid any legal problems and headaches. i'm willing to bet if the guy from this story had a firearm it would have simply been another case of SSS and we wouldn't have heard a thing about it...
787773,manitoubass2,2013-05-21 20:11:00,11391,"I'm glad the guy survived, crappy news about the dog though.  Out of all my years in the bush hunting and fishing etc, nothing ever scared me as much as getting rushed by an aggressive female bear. Seriously I don't think my heartrate returned to normal for at least 4 hours after the experience. That was just a few blocks from my house too, and I was with my kids. Thankfully it ended well and nobody was hurt/dead. Because I was unprepared for an incident, the only weapon I had was a lousy fillet knife, lol.  When a bear comes from 100 yards to 5 feet away in just a few seconds, it's quite the experience. Even with a gun, I'm not that confident I could shoot anything other then the head, anyhow.  Where I live in NW Ontario, the bears are becoming more aggressive and it just seems to come with the shift in nature. We now have an explosion of deer in the area, as well as rabbits. With them came cougars. My whole life I never saw a cougar in the wild, now in the last 7 years I've seen 3. The last one being two years ago, again, just by my house, actually almost the exact same spot the bear rushed me at, lol. Wolves as well, just seems like an explosion in the population lately, and all the animals mentioned are pushing more and more into populated areas."
786582,lew,2013-05-14 20:31:00,12766,"I mentioned it here before, but I had a bear come up my driveway last summer and tear the downspout off the side of my house.  Darned things are everywhere around here."

786593,Tootsie II,2013-05-14 22:11:00,162,"Just remember guys that you're not supposed to have a gun with you in the bush out of hunting season. I know of one case many years ago when a guy and his wife and kids were berry picking and he had a rifle with him. A CO approached him and charged him. When the guy got up in court he told the judge that there were bears in the area and that he was protecting his family. That's one of the few times that I ever heard of a judge using common sense and chastising the CO for wasting the court's time on such an issue. Nowadays, you might lose your gun possession rights. Has anyone tried those bear bangers? They are almost as loud as a 12 gauge. Been tempted to buy a couple but even then old ""betsy"" won't be far away. As the mayor of Hearst said on one tv show recently, if you have to shoot one, make sure you practice the 3 S's ( Shoot, shovel and shut-up)"

786606,glen,2013-05-14 22:51:00,2641,Either carry a gun or wear a hockey helmet. It will be harder for them to bite down on your head.

786657,Tayzak15,2013-05-15 01:42:00,318,"Funny after we start talking about this, when I went to work this morning there were bear tracks in the snow in my front yard. So one had been passing through sometime through last night."
786661,Tootsie II,2013-05-15 01:58:00,162,"I don't know that I would want to try walking around the bush in June or July with even a non-restricted gun in Ontario. If a CO saw you, he would probably charge you with hunting out of season. Even if you weren't, he'd still lay the charge and seize the gun. You'd probably have to hire a lawyer to go to court to get the charges thrown out and then still fight to get the gun back. The CO doesn't care because he has a charge to his credit and he gets paid anyway whether he's in the bush or in court. Unfortunately the mentality around firearms in Ontario is far far different than in BC. My son got his PAL out there in one four hour course. Here in Ontario, one of the instructors who used to live down the street from me and who was a retired CO quit because the red tape was getting so bad and they kept stacking more and more stuff on the course.  Now I know I'm a little long in the tooth, but when I took my licensing course in1964, and I will admit to not having hunted for 20 yrs or more. at that time you could not carry a gun in the bush in the off season."
786668,Tayzak15,2013-05-15 02:17:00,318,Even if thats the case I'l still take my chances. Not many CO's where I live. I'd rather have the gun on me to defend myself than only keep it around during hunting season that's for sure
786675,Tootsie II,2013-05-15 02:48:00,162,"LOL, There's enough of them. My fishing partner and I got checked on Sinclair last summer by Mr. Sirracco out of Gogama. Seemed like a nice guy but I wouldn't want to cross him.  I'm a Timmins native myself. Don't know if you now the name but it was Archie Chenier of the Porcupine Rod & Gun that taught me my gun course in 64.  It's not the first time we've been checked. The previous CO in Gogama checked us in 2005."
786677,Tayzak15,2013-05-15 03:08:00,318,"Unless they've added more there's usually only 2-3 Co's on patrol at a time in the area which is nothing for how vast it is. I was down camping on SInclair/Kapiskong last summer too for a weekend, didn't run into any of them there. Usually they are near the main big lakes (Kenogamissi,Horwood,Mattagami lakes and Nighthawk/Barbers Bay area)"

786711,Fish4Eyes,2013-05-15 12:31:00,1022,"I'm not a hunter myself, but even if I was my opinion is that I am safer with bear spray than a shot gun. Your odds of missing with bear spray is less likely. Your chances of missing and or getting a shot at the bears vitals is very difficult when a bear is charging full speed at you."
786718,Muskieman,2013-05-15 13:01:00,2472,"I was stopped with my rod and rifle years ago .. Was asked where I was going and what my intentions were , rifle was for target practice or protection against aggressive bears , the rod was for catching specks , was told if I shot a bear to report it , that was it , free to go ."
786739,troutologist,2013-05-15 14:39:00,951," I disagree with you here. Is bear spray effective? Yes, certainly, it provides a behaviour break that can allow for you to seek safety. (See an article by Herrarro on its utility) But you have basically 2 effective bursts from a can, and regardless of what is advertised you need the animal at hear handshaking distance to be effective. Lets not forget the wind and blowback.....  To score a good pattern on a bear (with spray) you have to hold your ground which is quite unnerving.  Things that push me to a fire arm are the predatory type bears that stalk and push and test you. You can tap your bear spray supply and have the animal back in minutes. It is a great first try to be non lethal to an over zealous bruin, but in my experience when a bear encounter gets to the point of requiring deterrents I would prefer to have the option of lethal force....though for most animals something like banging pots together are enough to move them along."
786771,Fish4Eyes,2013-05-15 18:06:00,1022,"I hear ya Jason. I guess it does really come down to personal preference. An experienced hunter and in my opinion especially a duck hunter who is accustomed to shooting fast moving targets would have less difficulty putting a shot in the vitals. However, duck hunting for pleasure and table fair is alot different than shooting at a bear knowing your life is at risk in seconds. If you follow recommended bear encounter techniques you should be standing your ground anyway if the bear is coming towards you. When I read the bear spray cans it said that the deterrant can spray approx 15-20', but your right with a wind that is botched. I would imagine that the bear would suffer for longer than a few minutes. I would think that they would not return to that same area as they encountered a negative experience there. Regardless, I would hope anybody with a brain would get out of there in a heart beat unless they have reserve bear spray.  I read something a little while back where it stated that if you did shoot the bear and were unsuccessful in killing it, they would become even more agressive during the attack as you have aggrivated the bear even more. I talked to a guy who said he shot a charging bear in the shoulder, it fell down from the impact and jumped back up on its feet and began charging even more aggressively, which prooves what I just said."
786781,SmackUm,2013-05-15 19:01:00,17,"He survived Ortona Italy and I can remember him saying it was like I was in slow motion I had a decision to make and I made it... My German Shepard Kazan stalled the bear just long enough for me to make a kill shot with the axe.. I think he was lucky I'd think you would only get one shot better to scare them off if possible with a bear banger.. How ever in this occasion he was gathering fire wood and actually fell on top of the bear he could feel it under his feet and he got out from under it.. The dog distracted it long enough for the swing and he dispatched it with an axe he was using for limbing the tree.. I didn't have the heart to tell Jack that the bear was probably blind due to hibernation but who is to know it could very well have killed him. The German Shepard was his favourite after World War 2 and he had to have one Jack also served with Farley Mowat on the Gothic Line & Hitler Line in Italy... I think he killed quite a few people when he was there but he did not like to talk about it as did Wilf our neighbour that worked on the Corvettes on the North Atlantic... Quite fankly I think when you have seen death up close you don't want to talk about it just forget it! As they said we did what he had to for our country! Cheers,Pat"

786789,SmackUm,2013-05-15 20:19:00,17,"Life on board a Corvette no thanks... Too funny I can remember the stories still to this day... But I think they need to reinstate the bear hunt we really need this in Ontario now! Cheers, Pat"

786791,cram,2013-05-15 20:29:00,1733,I think you'd have to encounter a LOT of black bears before running across one that wanted to eat you.    Wouldn't worry too much about it.

786319,jedimaster,2013-05-13 20:46:00,3472,There are plenty of bear huggers here on this site that will come to the defense of the bear. This topic has gotten pretty heated in years past.
786325,lew,2013-05-13 21:02:00,12766,"According to what I heard on the news last night, the bear was hunted down & killed after the attack.  As for the dog, I remember reading an article and it claimed alot of the troubles come during a bear encounter when the dog goes after the bear, then the human tries to help the pooch and the bear then turns on him."
786326,ch312,2013-05-13 21:07:00,1590," ah yes, you mean the type of people who demanded that the spring bear hunt be cancelled which has resulted in far more nuisance bears and close encounters which in turn means more problem bears than ever are being shot before deadly encounters occur? hunting is a valuable means of wildlife management. i just wish those who have never stepped foot outside the city limits could understand this.  it's too bad he didn't have a firearm to deal with the problem animal before it killed his dog and endangered the mans life."
786338,Tayzak15,2013-05-13 22:17:00,318,"This is absolutely dead on. I'm from Timmins and know someone that knows this guy. He ran out of his cabin once the bear chased him because the bear climbed in through the window of his cabin. This bear was freakishly aggressive and I'm afraid this is going to happen more this year because of the late winter, and lack of food for the OVERPOPULATION!!!!  of bears in our area. I know myself for sure I will be keeping my shotgun and slugs close by to me every day I'm on the water or in the bush this year."
786368,pidge,2013-05-14 01:01:00,438,"Those words dont sound reasurring Tayzak15. I fish in the bush and work (often alone..work) in the bush and I cant shake the whole ""bear"" thing. I hate that I cant get it outta my head when at work. Ive seen tracks a few times at work and this certain area (anything Hwy 115/35 East, same lateral as the Petro Can. and Country Style) makes me nervous."

I am not afraid of them nor do I want to hug one I  just gained a little more respect , as for the ugly cougars ... definately more afraid of those , wouldn't hug one no disrespect"
786376,Tayzak15,2013-05-14 01:23:00,318,"  Yeah usually I am never too worried but with this long lasting winter up north and the bears already awake there will be a lack of a food source at least for a while.  Hopefully I will never have to use the gun, but I am going to keep it by my side when I'm out alone or with other ppl camping just to be safe this year because I have a bad feeling it will be a bad season for bears. I have never had to do this before, but I am taking extra precautions this year especially after learning about this bear climbing into the guys cabin to attack him."
786395,Rod Caster,2013-05-14 01:56:00,5784,"or bear spray at least.  I'm not sure the statistics show that there have been more attacks since the cancelation of the spring hunt. Freak incidents will always happen, not sure anyone can blame this on politics."
786413,Tayzak15,2013-05-14 02:27:00,318,"I'm not too sure if attacks have increased, but bear sightings have definitely increased. Often the ones that wander into towns, or you can see out in the open are the ones that would usually get hunted down. Now with this late winter, lack of food and increasing population I have a bad feeling bears will be much more aggressive this year."
786477,Rod Caster,2013-05-14 11:52:00,5784,"I hope not, I'll be getting me some bear spray this year as I plan on camping/walking in the bush more than usual."

786571,Fish4Eyes,2013-05-14 19:33:00,1022,"The dog may have saved his life as the breed does not back down. But had it of been a different breed of dog you bet he would come running back to the owner once the bear has had enough of it and started chasing the dog. So now you are luring the bear towards you. Unless the dog is highly trained, I would be keeping it on the leash. Heck I'm not even bringing my lab up north anymore after witnessing her getting eaten alive by mosquitos."
