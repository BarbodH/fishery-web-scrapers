787545,Joey,2013-05-20 20:33:00,9122,"Finally got the boat ready for the season and decided to head out for Lakers on Simcoe.  Went 4 for 4, so a good day overall.  Kept one for the BBQ and let the rest go to be caught another day  Was quite foggy out there this morning.  Bugs were nasty.  Here's a few pics from the day.                    "
