787749,Rizzo,2013-05-21 18:48:00,4754,"I've always had a minn kota in the past, and when I pointed it somewhere and put it on cruise you could pretty much leave it alone while you fished, with the occasional tweak of the pedal to stay on course. When I used my new motorguide yesterday it seemed incredibly high maintenance. If I wasn't constantly on the pedal the thing was doing 360's...very inconvenient. I'm assuming there is a way to kind of ""lock"" the foot pedal in place? If I have to constantly have my foot on the pedal I'm gonna go nuts. Before I go read through the instructions I hoped someone here would have a quick answer like ""yes it will lock"" or ""nope, you're screwed and your new trolling motor will drive you insane requiring your constant attention"""
787751,BillM,2013-05-21 18:51:00,17367,Cable operated?
787754,Rizzo,2013-05-21 18:58:00,4754,yes cable operated
787755,Terry,2013-05-21 19:00:00,14456,screw on bottom or front or back of foot control to stiffen steering
787757,BillM,2013-05-21 19:01:00,17367,Sounds like normal operation for a cable steer motor..  http://www.walleyecentral.com/forums/showthread.php?t=112959
787758,Raf,2013-05-21 19:04:00,3495,you'll get used to it (maybe) but the foot needs to stay on the cable steer.
787762,Rizzo,2013-05-21 19:28:00,4754,...I can see it now...go to figure 8 a fish and the boat itself will start doing figure 8's. I'm hoping it can be tightened up otherwise I see a lot of trolling in my future
787764,fishnsled,2013-05-21 19:38:00,3520,Don't run the motor with the constant on.  (Switch on the side of the foot pedal)  Have it set to run only when you foot is on the switch.  That way your foot can come off the pedal while you tend to the fish and the boat will not be doing figure 8's.
787768,Lape0019,2013-05-21 19:49:00,647,"I had a 46# motorguide pro series that came with my boat a few years ago. There was no way to tighten the cable and you were basically leaft needing to keep your foot on the pedal. I hated that thing!!!!. It was way to small for the boat, didn't chop through any weeds, and the mount always popped like it was twisitng when I tried to turn. When trying to pull the motor up, the metal bar that locked it in place would sometimes get stuck as well.  I switched over to a Minn Kota and haven't looked back. I cannot comment on how much better the Minn Kota is in my circumstance because I went to an electric steer instead of cable steer. It has been the best investment on my boat to date though."
787777,F7Firecat,2013-05-21 20:25:00,347,go buy a terrova and be done with it
