Just wondering what you guys think are some good things to have in the canoe, whether it be store bought, or even better I'd love to see your DIY projects, thanks!"
787812,lew,2013-05-21 22:40:00,12766," When my brother and I were kids we rigged up a sail with a bed sheet and 2x2's on our canoe and had a ball with it. Only trouble was we never figured out how to sail back home again into the wind so we always ended up doing ALOT of paddling.  Thirty minutes to sail with the wind pushing us one way, but 2 hours to paddle back."
787826,Christopheraaron,2013-05-21 23:07:00,3525,"I'm working on some outriggers right now, I'll post some pics once I get it all figured out"
787855,EC1,2013-05-22 00:00:00,930,Have boat seats? Trolling motor with mount? Perhaps something to mount a fishfinder? The first 2 are now musts for me - and the fishfinder really depends if you're fishing with familiar or new water.
787881,Broker,2013-05-22 01:14:00,482,"Have you found the boat seats make the canoe less stable because you sit higher up? Just wondering! Also the trolling motor sounds like a great idea for me, will look into it"
787885,kickingfrog,2013-05-22 01:39:00,8333,"The stability (instability) would have to do with how high the weight of the person ""sits"". If you are sitting on a seat that is 3 inches above the gunwales it would indeed be unstable. Put the seat lower and the canoe becomes less unstable."
787891,NAW,2013-05-22 01:57:00,4022,Do you got any pop holders installed?
787900,Broker,2013-05-22 02:29:00,482,Yes I do  I was wondering about the stadium seats for Walmart instead of a boat seat because I don't want to go to the trouble of lowering the seats down
787907,Shloim,2013-05-22 02:44:00,515,I just built a fishing canoe this year my self. Have outriggers and a trolling motor. Works great!  I can stand and cast no problem. I'd post a picture if I could figure out how
