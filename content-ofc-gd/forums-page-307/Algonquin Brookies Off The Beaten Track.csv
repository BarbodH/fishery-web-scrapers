788023,solopaddler,2013-05-22 19:15:00,8605,"Thanks for the kind words everyone!    Miro we left on Sat night before the weather turned really bad on Sunday. We had great weather except for Friday. It started raining heavy around noon and didn't stop 'till late that night.  Sorry to hear about your luck, it's been just a crazy spring for sure."
788025,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2013-05-22 19:47:00,0,"nice pics.  there was still snow up in lake superior park for my trip so we had to fish a different chain of lakes than we planned originally.  the ice out fishing was pretty slow however the snow in the bush allowed us to keep our minikegs ""cold certified"" and then some."

788087,Christopheraaron,2013-05-23 00:59:00,3525,"Sounds a lot like our trip as well (same days), except I was on the north end, on a big lake. NASTY"
788125,solopaddler,2013-05-23 02:24:00,8605," That's interesting about LSPP. There's a 50/50 chance I'll be in the park next week with my son, was wondering about conditions."
788135,gino,2013-05-23 03:20:00,400,"excellent report, Mike...as always...loved the video with Julian, we met him on Temagami in february when when we ice fished for lakers, awesome guy..."
788187,Jds63,2013-05-23 15:33:00,1365," Hey Bud thanks, I remember you well, we should have shared more beers ... I wish I had that giant truck you guys had to get around the ice"
788261,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2013-05-24 01:37:00,0, I think you'll be fine with snow by then!  Even as we were there the last bits of snow around our campsite melted.  I'm going to stick closer to the soo for this weekend to see if things are a little further ahead here.  I see things being pretty decent for you next week if you make it up.
788273,solopaddler,2013-05-24 02:39:00,8605," LSPP was my backup if the scheduled fly in fell through because of the late ice out. Just found out this afternoon the fly in is on. Pretty exhausting last couple of days though, I've been preparing stuff for two completely different trips LOL!"
788277,gino,2013-05-24 03:01:00,400,"Julian, good to hear from you ...hope to meet you again, until then, tight lines!"
788322,ehg,2013-05-24 14:47:00,2666,I really like this report!  The video of the trout fishing really put me there enjoying.the typical Algonquin landscape. Put it on full screen and the video was incredibly clear and stable.  Your enthusiasm for fishing probably keeps you young and strong.
787803,solopaddler,2013-05-21 22:26:00,8605,"For me the true harbinger of spring is ice out in Algonquin Park.  Winter weary muscles strain under the heft of a pack as you pick your way along a wet portage trail. The rich smell of earth and fallen leaves waft in your nostrils as you plod along. There is little new growth, yet the forest seems alive and reborn. Being a part of it all is panacea for the soul. This is where I belong, it is my Church.  Recently I was able to share this experience with a good friend and fellow board member. We set up a comfortable base camp and did day trips into several small, isolated lakes, none of which had groomed trails leading into them. It was bushwhacking at its finest.  Fish are always a bonus on these trips and we did catch a few. None were large, but that didn't matter.  Here are some images:    End Of The Trail      Fresh Bear Scat      Struggling      A Comfortable Camp        Camp Cuisine      Ascending A Steep Hill In Search Of Trout       The Wolves Were Busy        Our Pulses Quicken When We Spy The Lake      Success!      Picture Perfect      Slippery!    Hope you enjoyed, Cheers, Mike"
787806,Christopheraaron,2013-05-21 22:35:00,3525,"Great report! Might that have been, ""the lake""?"
787808,danc,2013-05-21 22:36:00,4677,It's reports like this that get the old heart pumping for me. Well done guys.
787811,solopaddler,2013-05-21 22:39:00,8605," I don't think so Chris, not the one you're thinking of anyway."
787818,kickingfrog,2013-05-21 22:51:00,8333,It still amazes me how many of those interior camp sites can look the same.
787823,muskymatt,2013-05-21 22:58:00,2608,"Awesome report, looks so similar to the one I was just at lol. Great pics "
787824,spincast,2013-05-21 22:59:00,3279,"sweet rewards for the strenuous efforts. the ""picture perfect"" shot is exactly that -great  view, and I bet the sound was just a perfect."
787827,solopaddler,2013-05-21 23:10:00,8605," It's elementary, we all go to the same campsite. It's an OFC secret society that only the cool kids are a part of LOL!"
787840,Joeytier,2013-05-21 23:32:00,3990,Nicely done.  I think that perfectly encapsulates the spirit of Ontario's provincial parks
787846,Ron,2013-05-21 23:40:00,1683,"I understand why your buddy was so worn out. Did you see the ball cap the poor bugger was wearing???? It probably drained all his energy mentally, to have to carry them alone."
787848,Rod Caster,2013-05-21 23:43:00,5784,Poor guy looked WINDED on that portage! haha.
787852,solopaddler,2013-05-21 23:52:00,8605, That was a low blow Ron.
787854,solopaddler,2013-05-21 23:56:00,8605, There's more to the story actually. I threw my back out badly on the very first portage carrying my pack and the canoe (getting old sucks btw). But I still left Julian in my dust. Sometimes you just have to suck it up. That's where the weak link comment came from in the video LOL!  (He's going to kill me now I know it  )
787858,RJackson,2013-05-22 00:18:00,113,Algonquin is a special place to many.  This report sums up the beauty and the pain of it.  I'll pass on the pain.  Great pics too!  RJ
787860,4x4bassin,2013-05-22 00:25:00,1025,"Thanks for the report Mike , was waiting for this one ! I just got back from a similar trip and agree with you 100%  about being in the bush and camping/fishing for trout come spring time . It is an experience like no other with all the smells , sights and of course the trout"
787875,can u fish,2013-05-22 00:56:00,326,Great report and photos Mike glad to see you were both rewarded for your efforts.  Cheers Mitch.....
787877,RickOnt,2013-05-22 00:58:00,669,"Hey Mike and Julian  ""Picture Perfect"" for sure!!  Good times  Cheers Rick"
787897,Jds63,2013-05-22 02:04:00,1365,"Wasn't sure if you were going to write up anything on this little foray into the park considering all the other bigger adventures you have planned, but thanks.  First off thanks for the great company, as you mentioned being out there in the park is like my church, its needed for the soul. My first trip into the park was in 1978 with a bunch of highschool buddy's,  and  I have been going pretty much every year since. LOL you probably would never be able to tell watching that video .... talk about gassed ... those friggen coolers certainly didn't help the cause, too much lazin around the house this winter ... I am with Mike that I hate doing double carries so I tried not to leave anything behind.  Mike is a machine ... he carried a pack and the canoe .... thought he might be part cyborg ... and then he has the cahonees to light up a smoke as he waits for me to catch up.... I must say the highlight was listening to the Leaf playoff game under the tarp after 7 hours of non stop rain and having a few refreshments."
787898,solopaddler,2013-05-22 02:13:00,8605," Not cyborg, BORG. You will be assimilated into the collective the next time you dawdle."
787902,Moosebunk,2013-05-22 02:35:00,3970,You got a drive in ya that never quits Mikey.  Cool seeing Julian along with ya for an adventure too.  Rest those achy muscles and bones... you're right back at it in T - minus... 5.... 4..... 3...... 2.....1....!!!
787919,Musky or Specks,2013-05-22 03:27:00,2710,This was a very nice report. We are all getting older can't wait for some portaging at closer as I won't be able to do any backwood stuff for a bit.
787927,Toad Hunter,2013-05-22 04:54:00,261,another great report Mike.. I especially enjoyed the picture of the bear skat  dont judge me lol
787988,Tomcat,2013-05-22 16:01:00,395,Great report and pics. Thanks for sharing Mike.
788017,mirogak,2013-05-22 18:32:00,387,"Nice Mike! Was this the weekend of May 10th?  I was in the park that weekend too and my trip turned more into a survival trip than a fishing trip ... ice cold water, freezing rain, blizzard, big lake waves, refuge in thick bush .. lol.... and I think due to the lake stratification effect not one fish was interested in a bite... I will do a report soon ..  thanks for sharing Miro"
788019,SmackUm,2013-05-22 18:48:00,17,Thanks for sharing Mike... I'll be attending Speck Church soon too!
