788361,Harrison,2013-05-24 18:17:00,2202,"Older post, bumping it to answer Msg I got today when asked about fishing thick weed for walleye.  Here you go."
788396,Moosebunk,2013-05-25 00:53:00,3970,"You should report more often.  I know this post is a million years old, but it's good stuff.  Cool info Harrison.  Best inland walleye in these parts for me since moving back home here 4 years ago, 6.2 lbs out of a small lake.  Caught on a bass jig... a Coffee Tube.  Bass ""stuff"" certainly does work.  And the funny thing about the smallies on that lake, they love the walleye grubs but you'll never get an eye bite those. lol."
788400,beagle dad,2013-05-25 01:20:00,224,have used similar to flippin jig with many yrs of experimentation I is my observation that it is actually the angle of the eye on the jig that helps it get to bottom through weeds I now pour and tie my own jigs using a 45 degree angle on the eyelet 1 or 2 member have tried these also when jigging it the weeds tend to glace off rather than hang on the eyelet
788429,capt_hooked,2013-05-25 12:09:00,212,I love pickerel... but they are hard to find...!  The local restaurants sell pickerel for $10.99 a plate..  don't know where they get it from...  you ask.. they don't say..?!  And I know it's not coming from commercial fishers... cause you can not use gill nets in 3 feet of weedy waters...  must be a bunch of kids... figured it out.. (catch a bunch and sell to the local food places... on the weekends..)... I dunno?  Time I tried it... tasted much more like Rose fish to me...  but the menu would not lie..????  Probably a typo?  Can't wait to get back out on the waters...  
449840,Harrison,2010-03-30 13:29:00,2202,"Hey all, I don't post many fishing reports to often anymore for various reasons, however I thought I would share this.  This is a technique we use for Kawartha walleye.  So with opener coming up soon I thought I would share and maybe help some boat more fish.  Early day we would target weededges dipping either grubs or ripping bucktails.  Which can produce fish like the buckhorn walleye below.   But as the sun rose and/or pressure turned on the fish would move deep into the weedbeds.  Where you could dip the pockets with the grups or bucktails, however we found the good fish would bury into the thickest growth where the above lures couldn't penetrate.  With clients in the boat we had to figure out a way to get them.  We did, and here is how we did it.  We would use a ""Flippin jig"" more known as a bass lure.  We would trim the skirts and thin them out a bit for a leaner profile.  Sometime the regualr ""chunk"" or pork works, if not, we use either a power worm or sassy shad/renosky to dress the jig.  Either 9/16 , 1/2 and 3/4oz are the go to's.  We fished it with a 20 or 30 braid and a lighter action rod to absorb the hookset, not to rip the lure out of the softer mouthed walleye.  But strong enough backbone to get them up and out of the think weeds.  Commonly known as ""dunking"" you vertical jig the bait into the thickest stuff and either jiggle it or rip it back.  Similair to rippin a bucktail, you can do the same with the flippin jig.  We've used to the bucktail and heavier lead for grubs to try this, but have more sucess with the Flippin jig.  I believe it has something to do with the profile and fall.  Anyways, below is a couple fish pics I could find on the puter with some Flippin Jig walleye.  Hope it gives you something else to try when you've given everything already in your arsenal a go.  Myself with one.   A co-angler with another one.   Good Luck."
449845,darsky,2010-03-30 13:35:00,586,also for something different I targeted walleyes last year using chart/white senko-type baits.Not just one but dozens were boated.Cast the cabbage.Results will be amazing.
449848,lookinforwalleye,2010-03-30 13:45:00,4399," I can vouch for the above,Scugog walleye love this technique aswell especially in the evening,problem is you need a real heavy rod to fling them balls.  Note!! post edited because someone got their shorts in a knot about posting a particular technique/lure.  Ridiculous"
449872,PERCHER,2010-03-30 14:23:00,787,Thanks for the tips.We might just have to make special trip now just to try them out. These are the post I like to read peoples personal techniques. Thanks
449883,skeeter,2010-03-30 14:52:00,1907,does this mean i might be able to catch a few walleye this summer? i will sure give it a try and i will post either way. thanks for the tips dan----from dann
449887,solopaddler,2010-03-30 15:01:00,8605,Some good info there for those who fish weed walleye.
449920,Spiel,2010-03-30 16:28:00,9065,"This is obviously a ruse, don't waste your time with this technique, it'll never work, seriously!"
449964,jimmer,2010-03-30 18:10:00,2730,Those big walleyes are off limits in the Kawarthas now. Nice techniques that most people have never tried.  Thanks for sharing.
449981,Harrison,2010-03-30 19:03:00,2202, Haha Spiel  If it was a ruse I wouldn't include below my favourite Buckhorn weedline area for some nice bigguns.....    
449986,Spiel,2010-03-30 19:18:00,9065,"  Is that your your honey hole, should have blurred out the background  "
449987,fishnsled,2010-03-30 19:19:00,3520,"Great tip Phil, too bad it never works....   Thanks for trying to help out. Nice of you to give away the bigguns spot though."
450013,Hedfish,2010-03-30 20:16:00,76, What technique do you use to catch those when nothing else works?
450015,anders,2010-03-30 20:29:00,1168,"That guy in the lawnchair is hilarious...just enjoying the scenery....""your turn to go down the slide or mine"""
450018,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-03-30 20:31:00,0,  i was gonna say it was TOO blurry!
450131,crappieperchhunter,2010-03-30 23:53:00,2582,"Eyes, Houseboats and bikini's....that's a true Kawartha post right there. Just need my morning coffee and a picture of an Osprey nest with a few heads peeking out and I'll feel right at home!  Oh and thx for the walleye tip. If I decide this summer to give the carp a break I might just give it a go"
450149,tb4me,2010-03-31 00:17:00,3295, sorry dont have the coffee but here's the osprey      
450153,crappieperchhunter,2010-03-31 00:24:00,2582, Thx for that tb4me. We have a nest just down from our place in Bobcaygeon. Mornings and evenings I walk over with a coffee or glass of wine and have a good chat with them.  Beansie and I chat with them at another nest near our carp spot as well. Can't wait to get back up there!!!
450155,tb4me,2010-03-31 00:29:00,3295,Your very welcome! This nest is on the trent right across from our dock! Its amazing the size of the fish they drag in that nest for food
450292,singingdog,2010-03-31 10:00:00,1047,Have you tried a dropshot rig on those deep-weed eyes? A heavy weight with a fluke or a leech imitation above it works well in that same situation.
450331,Harrison,2010-03-31 12:34:00,2202," Hey singingdog,  Yes, the dropshot works well sometimes for sparser weeds, however when they are thick and/or canopied(that even a word?) folded over for lack of a better term, the dropshot can be counter productive.  Unless you texas rig or texpose the plastic it is easy to get hung up.  Not mention harder to get a solid hookup texas style.  Distance between the weight and hook can be hard to judge as well with the varying canopy and ""weed under growth"" in some of these thick weedbeds.  Especially in the Milfoil.  The ability to utilize the weight, bulk and weedguard on the fliggin jig is key.  Of course this is all my opinion, but this is what I found works for us.  Here is a pic I found on the web showing somewhat the water I am taking about. Not so much surface cover, as it is usually a foot or two below. Good Luck. "
450442,Harrison,2010-03-31 17:22:00,2202," Oh, the house boaters...well they are tricky.  Usually it starts with a lot of wine, which turns into the Newphie Jig somehow and what makes it worse I aint newphie, then for the finish I bust out singing one of my Dads songs ""My Sweet Lord"".  I hooked up once with this technique, but the wife is starting to get impatient waiting for my inheritance."
450632,Kerry,2010-04-01 03:06:00,383, Met a fella on Balsam last year who was doing exactly that with trimmed down 1/2 oz black hair jigs.Thanks for the reminder! Kerry
450648,OhioFisherman,2010-04-01 04:26:00,6623,"My biggest walleye came casting s 3/8 ounce tandem blade chartruse and blue spinnerbait through the grass on a weedy point on the Georgian Bay. I have also caught them on a jig and pig, jig and worm. If a bass will eat it usually a walleye will too."
450699,The Urban Fisherman,2010-04-01 13:47:00,2050, yepp - my old man caught his Personal Best walleye fishing a BIG spinnerbait for musky on Scugog!
479684,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-06-26 16:01:00,0,Sorry for redigging this one up but that is some amazing tips. That milfoil doesn't look deeper than 6 feet though!
