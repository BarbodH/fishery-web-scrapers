787810,Rustic-Fisher,2013-05-21 22:37:00,826,"Took the little guy for a few hours to some stocked rainbow ponds . Kid had a blast !! And so did I LOL. With a Rod rigged with 2lb fluorocarbon a small float and worm the kid was a force to be reckoned with. At age 3.5 he's enjoyed a few successful outings already BUT today he blew me away!! In the hour we were there we caught fish steady, enough to coax an angler and his 3 year old to make the walk around and fish right beside us. On the rivers or in a boat you'd lose your mind but the trout ponds are for kids so I was hoping to see the little guy hook one . After a chat with the other father we learned that they hadn't hooked anything all day. Not ten seconds after hearing that we're into another . I ask my son if he'd like to give his rod to the other little boy so he can reel one in and his words exactly "" that's a great idea""!! He stood by the other little fisherman shouting instructions and words if encouragement . I couldn't of been more proud. That's what it's all about."
787816,kickingfrog,2013-05-21 22:48:00,8333,Awesome day.
787819,Terry,2013-05-21 22:52:00,14456,cool
787820,davey buoy,2013-05-21 22:53:00,5505,"Your right,that's what it's all about .Great day!"
787821,spincast,2013-05-21 22:53:00,3279,"great way to introduce a kid to the fun. I did the same with my daughter and she still loves fishin' ( not as much as G, but he's as nuts as me  ) great story about his sharing the rod - I bet the little man he handed the rod to was ear to ear smiles."
787822,misfish,2013-05-21 22:58:00,29133,"Knowing you Ryan,I can see your son doing that.  Great story bud."
787832,Ralph Field,2013-05-21 23:19:00,1018,I like the fact that you and your son shared your knowledge with others.
787837,Ron,2013-05-21 23:28:00,1683,"Nothing I like more to hear than getting kids hooked on fishing. Your absolutely right, stocked ponds were invented with kids in mind."
787867,TJQ,2013-05-22 00:36:00,7806,very nice
787925,Toad Hunter,2013-05-22 04:47:00,261,"love this story - so did the other lil one land one on the ""lucky rod"" or what ? also, my sons 5 mths old-- how long till you figure his hands will be strong enough to haul one in ? lol"
787926,solopaddler,2013-05-22 04:51:00,8605,"I can just picture it, great stuff!"
787955,Harrison,2013-05-22 12:00:00,2202,Now that's cool!
787965,Rustic-Fisher,2013-05-22 13:10:00,826,"Other little guy landed his fish , and the boys took turns trying to subdue the flopping trout it was priceless LOL. Really made me wonder, the next time I'm fishing a crowded pool on a river and I'm getting fish ( wishful thinking) maybe I should pass my rod to the new guy who's just starting instead of coursing to myself about how this guys messing everything up."
788041,adolson,2013-05-22 20:53:00,783,That is so awesome! I can't wait for my kid to come out fishing with me - I hope he likes it like that!
