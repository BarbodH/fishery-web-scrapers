787070,RJackson,2013-05-16 20:15:00,113,Crappie!  not Crappy!What a treat this spring has been on the Crappie hunt.  Changed things up and avoided the community holes and set sights on unlocking a few new lakes to us.  And unlock em we did.  Awesome days were had.Lots of guests and loads of fish....Lots more pics and a few things we did differently this year to whack the Craps good are here : http://www.rjnbirdeesoutdooradventures.ca/?p=1221Have a great long weekend folks!  Weather should be great and the fish should be snarly.RJ
787073,misfish,2013-05-16 20:23:00,29133,"MEGA SLABS Very nice. Good to see the BIG GUY,out fishing."
787075,lew,2013-05-16 20:40:00,12766,Looks like a few good feeds there RJ
787083,fishindevil,2013-05-16 20:53:00,6254,Holy crappie spring is right !!!!! Awesome fishin guys !!!!! I see you got out with big Jim too !!!! Well done some real slabs there !!!! Wicked color on them too !!!! Cheers
787091,BillM,2013-05-16 21:02:00,17367,Nice!!!  I haven't caught a single one below a float this year either.  tiny ice jigs tipped with a tube = deadly.  I even troll them behind the boat at 1-2mph.  Works awesome and you cover lots of water.
787127,Chappee,2013-05-17 00:38:00,10,"The community hole has been fished out RJ.... or at least it seemed that way the two times I fished it this year....lol Wise to move on, nice lookin slabs!"
787137,Sinker,2013-05-17 01:54:00,8692,That's a pretty crappy spring for sure! Nice work RJ and crew!  S.
787161,RJackson,2013-05-17 12:29:00,113,"Thanks boys.  Getting Jimmy out on the water regularly is always a treat.  He's doing great for those who may be curious.  BillM, trolling eh?  That may be tried in these parts soon, cool.  RJ"
787166,jammer,2013-05-17 12:50:00,43,Thats alot of smiles and alot of crap...pies...  lol  Hope to cya soon bud...  Be well...  Jammer
787167,jammer,2013-05-17 12:53:00,43,Have no idea why there is lines threw my words...
787195,BillM,2013-05-17 15:05:00,17367," Stumbled across that pattern completely by accident, lol!    Even a few walleyes in the mix as well."
787209,Hooked,2013-05-17 16:32:00,891,"Wow, those are some fine specimens!  Was there a bait that did the most damage?  Nice job!"
787443,targaboy175,2013-05-20 02:02:00,76,"nice nice and super nice, doing pretty good myself this year too. will post pic laster  nice work"
787506,solopaddler,2013-05-20 16:43:00,8605,"Wow, nice bunch of slabs!"
787857,RJackson,2013-05-22 00:10:00,113," Best baits for me this spring have been a two inch tube with a 1/32 oz jighead, no float.  Another winner when they are a bit deeper ie. 8-10 FOW is a 1/16ths oz Nuckleball jig with a 2 inch Fluke.  Always white so I can watch em disappear!  Back at em today for one last go with my buddy Markus while he was in town for a few days, they are now post spawn and even more snarly.  "
787865,BillM,2013-05-22 00:34:00,17367,Very nice!  I've been fishing for them post spawn for probably 2-3 weeks..   Couldn't believe it when I found them in 25ft of water..   Those are some nice dark specimens!
787886,RJackson,2013-05-22 01:40:00,113,Right on Bill.  They are getting closer and closer to deep water.  Then they'll be nomads for the summer.  Buggers!  RJ
787918,BillM,2013-05-22 03:24:00,17367,"I've got a spot where they tend to congregate and chase shiners on the surface in the evenings.   This only lasts about 2hrs however.  After that, I haven't the slightest idea where they disappear to, lol!"
787987,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2013-05-22 15:44:00,535,"Nice haul! I've only caught 1 by accident, it was a decent sized one at 14"". A buddy of mine caught one 15.5"" in the same area before too, those are the only crappie I've ever seen personally."
