After around 20 consecutive giggle laden views later Jack says to me,  ""Dad.......how are R2-D2 and Yoda moving by themselves?""  I replied, ""ahaaaah....it's magic"",  Jack starts laughing and shoots me his 'dad you're so silly/ stop teasing look' and replies,  ""it's not magic, you're using an invisible hand!""  AWESOME!
