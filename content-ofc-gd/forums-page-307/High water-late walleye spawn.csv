Now, we went out the other day for opener, and we did ok on the walleye. But it was clear they had not spawned yet.  This is the latest I've ever seen for a walleye spawn on Rainy river.  Next week is the Emo Walleye Classic and I'm sure there will be MUCH bigger bags of fish this year than in previous years. I'm hoping it doesn't negatively effect the spawn though.  So far it's been a weird season on the river, frig, even the sturgeon arent spawning yet.  Water temps are around 48 and dropping fast as the water continues to rise"
787759,tbayboy,2013-05-21 19:07:00,1497,We saw the same thing in the Thunder Bay region (My post about it is down below somewhere). Lots of large prespawn fish in cold water (we only saw 48 in shallow rivers and didnt find any eye's there).
