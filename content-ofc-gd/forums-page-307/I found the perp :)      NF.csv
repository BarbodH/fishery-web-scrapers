788226,Joey,2013-05-23 21:23:00,9122,"Here's the loudmouth that keeps me up at night.  He's in the backyard neighbour's pool (or as I call it, the mosquito maker)     "
788228,Roy,2013-05-23 21:26:00,13728,hahahaha I feel a family resemblance there. Great pics!
788237,kickingfrog,2013-05-23 22:14:00,8333,He's likely eating those larvae as well.
788240,Joey,2013-05-23 22:18:00,9122,"   Yes, I see the resemblance too hon     Well, you`re right, I guess he can stay then!!"
788243,ketchenany,2013-05-23 22:37:00,3229,"The legs are a delecacy, you need a few more! Great shots, How's the rabbit?"
788244,Joey,2013-05-23 22:45:00,9122,Tastes like chicken  The rabbit has not come back.  Either moved on or was someones lunch
788249,Rizzo,2013-05-24 00:06:00,4754,note to self...never swim in that pool
788251,esoxansteel,2013-05-24 00:07:00,1307,"You solved the puzzle, your photography skills are phenominal Joey,"
788255,Joey,2013-05-24 00:37:00,9122,"   Don't even get me started Rog.  I wish there was a ""the neighbour is breeding mosquitos in their pool"" hotline because they are too lazy to drain or get up and running every year     Thanks.  These ones are actually kinda crappy cause I darned near broke my neck taking them.  I stood on a patio chair and got the one with the blown up throat through a crack in the fence, but could not see over the fence, so I stood on the two arms of the chair, snapped off a few and then the chair fell over in the soft ground     I landed on my feet, but decided that was enough pics of the toad for one day"
788260,mercman,2013-05-24 01:28:00,7054,Awesome Pics Joey !!! Be comforted knowing his serenade will stop when he has his fill of lovely amphibion ladies LOL
788296,grimsbylander,2013-05-24 11:43:00,3016,"Looking at those photos I'd say he's just letting you know the water is knee-deep, knee-deep"
788325,Joey,2013-05-24 14:50:00,9122, 
788339,Bernie,2013-05-24 16:05:00,3190,Neat shots Joey. Have at least one of those around the cottage too but it blends in with the other lake noises like waves on the shore and loons. Lots of noise from such a small thing.
788341,Sinker,2013-05-24 16:09:00,8692,"I open my pool early every year to keep them, and the mosquuitos away. I don't mind the toads, but the skitters drive me and the dog batty!  Great shots! I'm surprised you got them in daylight. Mine seem to start going at dusk, and all night long.  S."
