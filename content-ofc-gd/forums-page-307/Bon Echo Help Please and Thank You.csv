We are heading up June 8th, so I believe only pike and walleye will be open. So if any one knows any could point us to the better pike and walleye lakes within the park that would be greatly appreciated. It would be nice if I didn't have to hear,""why do you buy all this fishing stuff, when you don't even catch fish""  Any other info on campsites or trails would be great as well.  Thanks, Bret."

Big Gull is 85% crown land, not many cottages. To get a camp site you have to see one of the lodge owners, not sure what they charge. We stay at Kirk Kove Cottages."
