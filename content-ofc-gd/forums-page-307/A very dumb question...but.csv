788311,outllaw,2013-05-24 13:12:00,1232,"lew gone are the days of carhops,baby moons. being a preppy or a greaser. these young bucks would never understand our lingo either lol."
787077,lew,2013-05-16 20:45:00,12766,"What the heck do the words mang and meh stand for ??  I keep seeing them but have no clue.  Forgive my dumbness, but I'm old"
787078,BillM,2013-05-16 20:49:00,17367,"mang is slang for 'Man'...  Like 'What up mang?'..  ala Tony Montana  Meh is like whatever, etc..."
787079,TJQ,2013-05-16 20:50:00,7806,"LOL..  no worries Lew..and I may be wrong as well.. but mang.. to me means ""man""  kinda slang, like whey hows it going mang??  and meh... means ""whatever"" in a blah tone... like ""hey hows your day going?"" ... ""meh""  (lol.. hear that one form the kids, )"

787081,Fishnwire,2013-05-16 20:51:00,983,"I think ""meh"" is something people say when the don't care or are unimpressed with something they've seen or heard.  ""Mang"" is ""man""...as is ""What's up, mang?""......but the ""joke"" is that the speaker has a latino accent, like Tony Montana from Scarface.    Opps....too late."
