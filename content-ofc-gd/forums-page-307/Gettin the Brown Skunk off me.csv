Water was at an all time low, I was skeptical. First 3 holes...chub central...4th hole...huge sucker gave me a scare..finally after walking a ways I found this guy.    â€‹Not a monster but definitely a good catch for the trickle I was fishing. As I was untangling this one, my buddy has one on in the next hole...its about a 2 pounder! I tried to help him land it but well it ended with a lot of four letter words..this was surely a trophy for this water.  Kept fishing found one more little one...And then what? Pulled out a tiny bow. Been fishing this water for 20 years never ever saw or heard of a bow coming out. Find the odd speck in here, but a rainbow? Not sure how it got there.  Anyway just glad to have the respect of my old honey-hole back....thanks for readin'  "
