786347,Rizzo,2013-05-13 23:03:00,4754,"Well after a LOT of research and a few polls on here (alumacraft vs smokercraft vs lowe) and (suzuki vs. merc. vs. yamaha) it was the alumacraft with the yamaha that won out. Once I brought my princecraft up to Kickingfrog, it was time to visit Clarence at Bay City Marine and bring this baby home. Glad I measured the garage twice, because even with the swing tongue this thing really maxes it out...only a couple of inches to spare! Was incredibly excited to get it out on the water this past Saturday, until truck problems left me in dry-dock. Thank you to all who posted their opinions. Although you caused me to spend more money (especially maxing the boat out with the 90) I think it was the right decision. One real nice surprise when I went to pick it up was the boat was on a galvanized trailer...I had not been expecting that. Clarence from Bay City Marine was a real pleasure to deal with, I would recommend anyone looking for a Lund check them out (they no longer carry alumacraft)."
786348,lew,2013-05-13 23:07:00,12766,"Very nice Roger & congrats on the new ride, she's a beaut for sure !!  Great choice on that Yamaha motor too, your gonna be more than happy with it."
786352,Roy,2013-05-13 23:32:00,13728,"Very happy for you, Roger. It's a beaut for sure and maxing it out was a good idea."
786353,kickingfrog,2013-05-13 23:33:00,8333,I like that one even better. Trade ya for your old one?
786354,Rizzo,2013-05-13 23:47:00,4754,Rob...we'll talk in 8-10 years!
786366,BillM,2013-05-14 00:52:00,17367,"Very nice!  You got a water/fuel separator on that rig?  If not, get one."
786371,pidge,2013-05-14 01:10:00,438,"Beautiful Rizzo. Congrats on the purchase, Were not worthy, were not worty!"
786382,Lape0019,2013-05-14 01:31:00,647,Sweet rig!!!!  I was looking at those with my father this winter during the Ottawa boat show. Spent about a half hour crawling around in the single console version and it was very well made. I am sure it will last you a lifetime.
786393,bobogo,2013-05-14 01:51:00,76, lol. I love that thinking!
786456,fishindevil,2013-05-14 07:42:00,6254,Nice rig man !!!!! Sweet....
786460,RangerGuy,2013-05-14 10:29:00,564,Awesome boat congrats!!  Your goin to love that yammie!!! We got the 75 tiller last year and its been awesome.  If your are close to a prop shop get them to check the Yamaha prop for balance. I was at Kawartha prop repair this weekend testing props and picked up a 4 blade SS..  We checked the balance on my original prop and it had one very heavy blade. I'm goin to have it balanced.  Post up some performance specs once she's broke in :-)
786508,nexstar,2013-05-14 14:30:00,63,Very nice looking. Congrats and catch lots of fish.
786524,lew,2013-05-14 15:17:00,12766," You coulda dropped in here for a coffee Greg, I'm only 10 minutes away."
788204,RangerGuy,2013-05-23 18:14:00,564,MAN!.. I did not realize that! bummer..pm me your address.. I need to go back to see Jon.. The 4 blade worked well but I lost to much speed and mileage with a load in the boat.  I'm thinking on a Merc Vengance 16p.. or a 4 blade aluminum to get the speed and mileage back.  Maybe I could use you as a passenger when testing LOL! Since your only 10mins away
788209,SmokestackLightnin,2013-05-23 18:52:00,390,Looks very nice. hope you get many years of trouble free boating.
788213,misfish,2013-05-23 19:54:00,29133,"Nice boat  Rog.  Is it me, are the consols getting closer to the bow on these new boats?"
788216,Jds63,2013-05-23 20:11:00,1365,thats a nice rig ... congrats
788304,F_ast,2013-05-24 12:41:00,154,"Ya, I made the mistake years ago not maxing out the boats max rated power.  It might seem great the first few rides, but you quickly regret not maxing out.  Sweet ride for sure though.  I dont know with such a light weight boat that a 4 blade prop is going to give you the best performance.  I would stick with a 3 blade IMO.  Something with a decent amount of cupping for bow lift and to hold the water in a turn trimmed out. That light load with a 90hp shouldnt need a 4 blade.  but if you have the oppertunity to test props, thats always a bonus.  Not sure about the Yami breakin either, but with my mercs, the max rpm changed once the motor broke in a bit,  I would wait to see where your rpms settle in before choosing a prop."
788324,Joey,2013-05-24 14:49:00,9122,Sweet ride Rog
