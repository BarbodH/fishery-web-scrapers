Sunday, G & I white striped again with one big laker who spat (and bent) the hook on G all to show for 6+ hours on the water.  Determined not to be beaten, we went back today and studied some new seams and spots. After a couples hours, finally he comes out to play. The dispey fires, lines peels out  G's turn up to the rod. Nearly pulled  him and the rod in the lake  . about 8 or so minutes later ""hello there chinny""   Lost a Laker at the net, and a flying bow 9 colours out - but definitely nice to see the lake starting to wake up. A smile to launch a 1000 fishing trips"

787612,kickingfrog,2013-05-21 00:33:00,8333,Nice job G.  I think a few of us (myself included) could learn a thing or two from you and how to actually look like we are having fun while fishing.
