They are Lhur Jensen ""hot lips""... 1/4 oz... Dive to 18 feet...  But what's neat is that they are custom painted with "" North American Tournament Trail"" on the side and a picture of a bald eagle... The box says they were made in 1993...  Anybody ever see these?.... Anybody think they're worth anything?         "
787716,Seaweed,2013-05-21 16:38:00,135,They might be worth something to a collector but probably not as much as the joy it would bring to catch a monster and think of your Grandpa's grin as he watches you catch the fish.... wherever he might be.  You might want to try them on some fall Quinte Walleye East of the Ferry.
