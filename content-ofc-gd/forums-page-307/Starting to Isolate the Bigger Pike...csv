787660,Rich,2013-05-21 11:05:00,3927,"Gave her a full day Sunday, the morning was great. 4 pike landed, two each, one spinnerbait one jerkbait fish for each of us. Biggest fish came on a clown color suspending Long A.. then in the evening lost my first true trophy of the season. The big one that got away plus the decent one landed in the morning just jettisoned my pike addiction into next month.  "
787664,Rizzo,2013-05-21 11:45:00,4754,...aaah the one that got away...keeps us all going back! The one you got looks pretty good though (although I think the pose might be giving it a bit of help!)
787670,woodenboater,2013-05-21 12:17:00,2277,"pose or not, that's a nice looking pike  looks like maybe 32"" or more ?"
787672,BillM,2013-05-21 12:20:00,17367,Nice gator there Mr.Rich!
787680,Rich,2013-05-21 12:58:00,3927,"Thanks, there is indeed some photo magic involved, lol. In my inflatable boat the camera only gets about 5 feet away, max, lmao, the arms length hold probably wasn't necessary, but meh. It looks huge. Haha  We estimated it around 32-33"" range"
787683,Musky or Specks,2013-05-21 13:08:00,2710,Thats still a decent pike for southern ontario. Good Job
787691,mattyk,2013-05-21 13:55:00,2110,Nice looking pike!
787705,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2013-05-21 14:50:00,535,"Nice pike! Too bad about the one that got away, we all have them. lol  "

787932,davey buoy,2013-05-22 08:27:00,5505,Beauty fish Rich. As said the one that got away keeps us coming back!!!!!
