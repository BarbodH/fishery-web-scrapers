788053,Musky or Specks,2013-05-22 21:46:00,2710,Some very beautiful fish there. I spent all day doing the chuck and duck at logjams yesterday trying to catch some decent browns. Lost one about fifteen inches but that's all the luck I managed to have. Did watch a spent steelhead doing nose to tail rises at the tailout of a pool. Wish I would have had the proper filter that I could have caught it on video for everyone. I love wild leeks and  wild garlic.
