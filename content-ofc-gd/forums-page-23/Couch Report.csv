1068680,misfish,2020-12-20 20:23:00,29133,"Still remember the year Terry and I ventured out on Little lake . There was a post later that day of a sighting of a red pop up, and how crazy we were to be out there. Little did they know,we were on a solid 4"". Oh, that was in November. LOL Think that is the longest ice season we ever fished . Ended mid April ."
141501,crappieperchhunter,2007-12-11 02:29:00,2582,Walked on the ice at Airport Rd and had a line in the water by 8AM. Stayed until 2PM and culled through about 60 perch to get 13 keepers between 10-11.5 inches. All on jigging raps and bugs.A solid 4-5 inches of black ice with an extra inch or so of white ice on top of that. Just a skiff of snow on top...perfect for walking.  A group of 4 was the only company I had out there. I chatted with them on the way in. They appeared to be having the same luck I had. Sure was good to be on the hardwater again...and fresh fish for supper tomorrow night.  Play safe if you get out.
141502,Roy,2007-12-11 02:32:00,13728,"WTG! Still, please be very careful if you venture out there folks."

141580,Beans,2007-12-11 14:52:00,3339,WTG my friend...That area always seems to freeze up early...nice eating size you ended up with...any bigger and you would have been putting them back eh?  
141592,crappieperchhunter,2007-12-11 15:24:00,2582,You know me to well Beansie....Over 12 inchers ALWAYS go back. But I didn't actually get any brutes yesterday...so it was a no brainer.
1068328,crappieperchhunter,2020-12-11 18:45:00,2582,Bored and going through old threads looking for a few things. Found this one and thought I would share. Ice fishing on Dec 10 2007 on Cooch. I'm just hoping I can be on Cooch by New Years this year🥵
1068329,irishfield,2020-12-11 19:04:00,26272,LOL I started reading it and thought 5 inches of ice..
1068330,lew,2020-12-11 19:10:00,12766,I was happy to see Roy posting again till I realized the post was 13 years old  LOL
1068331,Terry,2020-12-11 19:31:00,14456,Knew right a way it was an old thread but wishin I was fishn
1068335,Big Cliff,2020-12-11 23:27:00,6899,I started reading it and went WHAT? Then I saw the date and went DAM 😊
1068337,Fisherman,2020-12-12 00:24:00,7201,You and me both.
1068338,GBW,2020-12-12 03:38:00,8460,"You wern't the only one saying ""dam"" there..."
1068339,Tjames09,2020-12-12 12:03:00,664,"I thought the same thing! Lol where is he seeing 5”, the. I saw 2007"
1068388,BillM,2020-12-14 02:54:00,17367,How many guys are going to head to Couch now lol
1068394,crappieperchhunter,2020-12-14 14:44:00,2582,LOL. Happened to me last year Bill. Ice was getting close and someone on another board posted a picture of their group walking out of Tudhope Park.  Called my buddy and we went up the next day. There was ice alright....maybe enough for a seagull to stand on without going through😠  Obviously the picture was not taken that week. Not a total loss though as we fished  2 other spots on the way back to Oshawa and ended up with a small feed of perch and crappie. To be clear I'm not trying to make someone waste there time for a trip up. I was just posting to show how late the ice is this year compared to what it was in 2007.
1068400,Fisherman,2020-12-14 18:03:00,7201,"I can remember many years ago a bud and myself went out on cooks bay on 12 Dec, 6 inches of sold ice and loaded up on perch.  One of those rare years."
1068402,crappieperchhunter,2020-12-14 18:13:00,2582,"I can't remember when it was, I'm thinking late 80's... but I fished through the ice on Couch once in November. I think that same winter the Great Lakes either froze over or they had the most ice that had ever been recorded on them. I just remember at the end of the season it was brutal drilling through all the ice because of the loooonnnggg cold winter.. Man it was thick. "
1068405,AKRISONER,2020-12-14 19:14:00,5558,"lol when i saw this thread I thought it was referring to a ""couch"" report...because all of us seem to be stuck with our boats put away and little to no ice on our lakes lol"
1068407,Fisherman,2020-12-14 20:38:00,7201,"Yes,  I can remember cranking the old hand auger until the folding point was even with the ice,  even as young as I was then it was a long crank."
1068659,akaShag,2020-12-20 00:35:00,2073,"Earliest I ever ice fished was 19 November, I forget the year but probably 1979.  It was a foothills lake near Pincher Creek Alberta, probably four inches of completely clear ice, played with your head as you could see VERY clearly all the way to the bottom.  Trout were willing to hit an offering, and it was very magical. Fisherman, you may have been there, I do not recall.  Roy E. went through the ice walking towards shore and I rescued him, Big Doug M grabbed my feet and pulled Roy and me away from the hole........"
1068660,BillM,2020-12-20 00:38:00,17367,"That never even crossed my mind.  Crazy how the years can be so much different.  Wait until the water levels drop in Gbay, people will think the world is ending (again, lol)"
1068662,Fisherman,2020-12-20 01:43:00,7201,"Hahahaha, not Doug Measor."
1068671,akaShag,2020-12-20 14:06:00,2073,Yep.
