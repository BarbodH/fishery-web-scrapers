1067432,tomkat,2020-11-15 22:58:00,246,Hey Sinker. I got my vinyl flooring at Basspro across the border in Niagara Falls area as I didn’t see it listed on the Canadian site but maybe they have it now or Cabelas. I used adhesive from Home Depot. Spray on for compartment lids and trowel on for the floor. I did it a couple years ago and it seems to be standing up well.
1067437,CPH,2020-11-15 23:39:00,11,"Sinker...If you paint the boat yourself that's one thing. If you paint it for a paying customer and not done properly that's a whole different ball game.  I have seen some very unfortunate people asking me to re-do paint jobs that they initially paid big bucks for. Like I said, I try to stay away from painting if I can and source them out to my contacts. I'm not saying not to paint. I'm trying to say be careful do your homework, ensure the shop is reputable and will warranty their work. We have done paint on boats where we have had to repair damage, which meant painting after the repair was done and then replace the decals such as Legend Boats. Yamaha PWC's which have that new  light weight NanoexCell body is painted.  When we repair the damage to the hull or sides, and we have done a lot lately( because no one else wants to touch them) we have to repaint them. Again, a very expensive job as we use a three part Yamaha OEM paint made by colorite out of the U.S. very durable and specific to ensure adherence to the plastic body and the abuse these wave runners get. We use the same vinyl flooring that Lund Boats use. Can be purchased from any Lund dealer. I'm sure there are others, however we have found it to be durable and nice to work with. A high premium outdoor floor adhesive should suffice however you mentioned aluminum plate flooring. I have never worked with aluminum floors, only wood and fiberglass. So that may be something you want to look into as far as vinyl to aluminum adhesion goes. I do not know anything about that. Wood would be much easier to work with, easier on the feet. Coated properly with fiberglass resin would give you those 20 years again and much cheaper?  Also, if the transom is wood, coated and sealed properly, will give you years of no problems. few of pics of different floor and transom repairs may give DIY's some ideas.

1067724,Bill,2020-11-24 00:56:00,140,Your boat looks great Chris.
1067725,Bill,2020-11-24 01:07:00,140,I have a 1961 18 foot AceCraft that I repainted. I stripped it using an orbital sander. Then epoxy primed using Southern Polyurethane.The blue is 1973 Corvette medium blue metallic base coat. Matrix is the paint company. The clear coat is Limco 4200. I bought the carpet in Barrie and used automotive carpet adhesive glue. The seats I bought from Extreme Marine near London. I did this during the winter of 2016. It looks the same today.            
1067728,Bill,2020-11-24 01:24:00,140,"This past Saturday, November 21, I finished replacing the transom. I used 3/4"" Birch plywood laminated to make it 1 1/2"". Left it vacuumed sealed overnight at 750psi to get a uniform bond through out the whole transom. Then gave it two coats of West system epoxy. Sanded the epoxy and gave it two coats of automotive clear coat. Sealed the edges with Marine silicone. When I get it out of storage I will replace the over length bolts. I had to get it together and into storage Saturday or I would have lost my spot so I just used carriage bolts I had. "
1067729,Bill,2020-11-24 01:26:00,140,"Alumacraft, I hope you enjoy redoing your boat as much as I did doing mine."
1067740,CPH,2020-11-24 03:26:00,11,"Great Job Bill, looks great. Did you paint that hull as well? Its fun working on these old boats and bringing them back to life, and even throw in some modifications..Its a labour of love..lol . I have another project I'm doing right now on a 16ft 1992 Sunbird bowrider. Took out the 3.0 OMC  motor and replaced it with a rebuilt 4.3 OMC, gutted the interior, have re-upholstered all the interior panels, replaced the gauges on the dash from another boat I scrapped. I took off the decals and got custom new ones, instead of Sunbird its going to be a Superbird..yes I'm a mopar fan. At one point I was even thinking of putting a wing on the back, like the 1970 super bird car, as I have a nice radar arch from a Thompson cruiser that I can cut down to size. After I shared my idea about the wing on the boat my guys won't let me near that arch now. I wonder why? (yeah I know..Cheesy). I am now in the process of wet sanding buffing and putting everything back together. I'll get some pics out once its done. Hoping some of these builds we post help others with their projects or at least gives them some ideas and info on different methods and products....or what not to do like put a wing on the back."
1067744,Bill,2020-11-24 10:08:00,140,Yes I have painted the complete boat. I posted my pictures to help give others ideas on what they could do with their projects.

1067773,Bill,2020-11-25 01:39:00,140,"I have a 1969 Chevelle that I never got painted. I did the body work on it and epoxy primed it in 1981. Then I backed it into the corner of the shop and put it on stands. I needed the money for my wedding that I had saved to finish it. I had the idea that after I got married I would get it painted. I am the second owner and it has less than 70,000 miles. It is the 300 Deluxe model with a 307 and 3 peed automatic transmission. "

1068104,Sinker,2020-12-04 15:40:00,8692,"Is there vinyl on top of it? I have been considering this as well. I have a good source for it. How slippery is it? What thickness did you use? I like both that, and the aluminum plate, then either vinyl or hydro turf over top for a bit of traction. I have use the poly board for a lot of other stuff, and it is super tough, and easy to work with. Its heavy, but my boat could use a little weight. I think once I tear out the foam this time, its going to be pretty light. If the lakes would freeze maybe i could stop using it and get started on tearing it apart lol  S."
1068125,Steve Piggott,2020-12-05 04:22:00,196,Texture surface. I left th vinyl on the aluminum hatch covers and sides
1068128,Fisherman,2020-12-05 15:24:00,7201,Nice to see an end product that looks super nice and knowing you did it yourself.
1068132,Sinker,2020-12-05 15:53:00,8692,"What thickness? The stuff I've used wasn't very sturdy unless it was fairly thick, and the thicker it is the heavier it is, so..... I guess depending how far apart your supports are, but I know mine are more than 16"", and less than 24"" apart. Do you get any sag anywhere? I like this idea, and its likely cheaper than aluminum right now too. S."
1068142,Steve Piggott,2020-12-06 01:46:00,196,3/4 weights about the same as wood and vinyl . No change in speed in my boat
1068275,Sinker,2020-12-09 20:42:00,8692,Perfect. Thanks for the info. S.
1068284,DanD,2020-12-09 23:29:00,2223,"What if you were to the have the hull sprayed; up to the level of the metal supports with high density closed cell spray foam? It'll add floatation and support between the metal cross supports; wouldn't it? High density closed cell spray foam; is supposedly ""water proof"" its not the same as open cell that will act like a sponge. Before suggesting this, I watch a few YouTube vids and they're using this type of foam for floating docks? I was curious (board actually. LOL) and thought I'd might try this the next time I'm fixing up an older boat or a dock? Dan."
1068295,Sinker,2020-12-10 14:39:00,8692,"Im not a fan of the foam. Its a PITA if you have to run wires, or anything else under there. If you have a problem down the road, you can't access anything, and it stops the water from flowing out of your bilge. I used the pour in foam last time in parts of my boat, and its not supposed to absorb water either, but it has 100%, and now its a PITA to remove lol......I'm using Foam board.  Easy in, easy out, and doens't absorb (as much) water. S."
1068975,Hack_Fisherman,2020-12-31 21:57:00,720,agreed on the foam board. Pour in is ok unless you have to trim off any that ballooned out which defeats the bouyancy as you have exposed the cells. pvc conduit is a good way to run wires you may need to fish out later. Bends beautifully with a heat gun
1068977,Hack_Fisherman,2020-12-31 21:58:00,720,Beautiful job!
1066604,Alumacraft,2020-10-15 23:48:00,139,"Planning on giving my almost 20 year old Alumacraft a major make over. I've got a 2001 Magnum 165cs  still a solid boat it's just looking like a 20 year old boat. I'm planning on getting the carpet replaced , ordering new factory seats. Also planning on either a new paint job or a vinyl wrap. I've been able to find a couple of places locally to do a wrap. Have a quote for $1800 for a wrap replicating the factory graphics brand name and model name. I'm not sure what a paint job would cost? What I'm trying to find is someone in the Niagara region that paint's aluminum boats. Trying to figure out if I'll have it wrapped or painted? Has anyone had there aluminium boat wrapped? Any pros and cons with a wrap over a paint job. Any information is greatly appreciated thanks gentlemen."

1066611,Terry,2020-10-16 13:38:00,14456,Most wraps have life span of 5 years i would go with paint if the price is right
1066628,Alumacraft,2020-10-16 23:57:00,139,Bigcreekdad I've got one quote for new carpet for $2500. I'm ok with that. I'm thinking about spending $8000-$10000 hopefully if it's a little more I'm ok with that it's still cheaper than buying a new boat. I've got no transom worries at all except for a week up north every year my boat is in my garage every night. 👍  Terry I've heard that a wrap will last for 5-7 year's not bad for under $2000. My issue is that I can't find anyone that will paint it so I don't know how much a paint job would cost? Has anyone had there boat painted? I'm clueless as to what a paint job would cost would like to hear from anyone that has had a boat painted. Just want to compare prices and make a decision. Thanks gentlemen
1066631,DRIFTER_016,2020-10-17 01:54:00,10439,I painted my 18 foot Fisher in the mid 90's. I did all the prep work myself and had a friends buddy who was a painter spray it for me. My paintjob was very reasonable because of the DIY aspect of it. Probably around $1000 including painting the trailer. I also replaced all the carpet and did that myself. Cost about $200 but a lot of hours. My boat was grey with grey carpet from the factory and I wanted to colour change to match my sweet navy blue Bronco.  😁

Drifter that sounds like a great deal for a paint job.👍 I don't have the patience to do the carpet myself as I know it will be a pain in the ... LOL. It's worth it for me too pay someone else to have it professional done. Porkpie that's what I'm hearing that a paint job could be as much as 3x the cost of wrapping.😲 I've got Auto Trim and Signs or Auto FX Graphics in St Catharines. Erin is a little far for me to go.

They do full restorations and might be a place where you can have your boat repainted.  Not cheap, I paid $5,000 for everything. The labour to cut out and replace the floatation foam was part of the reason for all of the labour. I was very happy with the results. If you have your boat restored check with your insurance broker to make sure your policy is up to the new value of the boat."

1067028,tomkat,2020-10-30 21:47:00,246,I took all of the carpet out of my old ranger and replaced it with vinyl. It didn’t take that long and only cost me a few hundred bucks. I used the vinyl thinking it would be easier to work with than carpet and it turned out pretty good. Save yourself a bunch of dough.

1067329,tomkat,2020-11-12 02:25:00,246,The cover is open to the bilge and I always thought of it as a drain but it would make sense that it works as a vent as well. At the back of the boat there is a removable cover to access the bilge and live well pumps so I guess that would also allow for air circulation. Boat is a 1991 Ranger 680 Fisherman tiller.

1067354,CPH,2020-11-13 17:38:00,11,"I tend to stay away from painting boats. Guys do use ""all grip paint"" which is marine boat paint and tends to work pretty good but it is very expensive and the application has to be just right or you will get eventual peeling. We did a 1960 18 foot aluminum boat the man wanted converted into a semi-bass boat with a casting deck, new floor, repainted boat and engine. We used All wheels body shop in Stoney Creek to paint the boat, and we did the motor. Jeff really knows what he is doing and did a great job on this wreck of a boat, and he is very reasonable. Here are some pics that gives you an idea of some of the build, and some inspiration that yes you can make an old boat into something new again.We took all the floatation foam out and replaced it. Totally soaked and probably added an additional 300 lbs to the boat. The customer could not believe how fast his boat was after the build. So bottom line is that a build like that is very time consuming and expensive. Knowing how expensive a complete make over would be we did try to talk the individual into just finding a newer boat. The customer insisted he wanted it done. He claimed the boat was his fathers,  then his, and once finished would give it to his son as a surprise present and keep it in the family. That's exactly what happened, He took the boat home and put it in the garage. he called his son to the garage. The son broke into tears when he saw it, and they were thrilled using it for 6 months when unfortunately the father suddenly passed away. The son has the boat, loves fishing with it, and it represents a near and dear ""forever"" reminder of his Dad.     "

This time I can just give it a clean up,  a  light sanding and wack the paint to it. The prep of bare alumiinum takes a lot of work, but it is well worth it to do it right.  I am tearing mine apart again this winter for another rebuild, and paint touch up. This will be the second time in a 26 year old boat. Where are you guys sourcing your vinyl flooring? And what products are you using to fasten it? This time my boat will be getting a full 3/16 aluminum plate floor, and mostly aluminum storage, with vinyl front to back and top to bottom. I plan to rebuild the transom this this time, not that it needs it, but whats the point of doing everything but the transom at this point?  Might go with an engineered product, so I never have to touch it again. After 26 years of fishing and hunting out of this boat, i have a few ideas, and changes i am going to make. I'm kind of excited, and anxious at the same time lol....Everything on it has been upgraded in the last 4 years;  electronics(2018), bowmount (2020), engine(2019), trailer (2017)......its time for a makeover. I considered buying new, until I looked at the prices. Then considered buying used, until I looked at the prices, so I will rebuild what i have one more time, and get another 20 years out of it. I love that boat!  We have been through some serious stuff together LOL S."
