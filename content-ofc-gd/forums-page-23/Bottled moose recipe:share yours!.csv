1068109,DanD,2020-12-04 17:46:00,2223,Going to try this beacon recipe for sure. I make my own cured and smoked beacon from pork belly. We use a lot of beacon here and it be nice if it was there ready to use; after a quick nuke in the microwave. Thanks Guys! Dan.
1068115,akaShag,2020-12-04 20:34:00,2073,"Yes Dan, it is pork belly (side) bacon that I have canned.  I also make my own smoked and cured side (pork belly) bacon and back (loin) bacon.  I also make bacon candy, which is bacon made with pork tenderloin.  I have never canned my own bacon after doing the cure and smoke - it would have to be a huge batch of pork bellies to do a canner load! I think it would be very challenging to try to pressure can back bacon, it's too lean.  I do pressure can ham, but for that I do a hot pack with broth from the roasting pan. BTW I see you live in London - I have bought side bacon from Krug's in Tavistock and canned that stuff.  Heavenly! Doug"
1068117,Fisherman,2020-12-04 20:39:00,7201,"Trying hard to wrap my head around this one, I would have thought the jars would explode without any liquid in them.  I'll have to try a small batch next time I do something that requires the same time in the canner."
1068119,akaShag,2020-12-04 20:43:00,2073,"That's why it makes me giggle.  The fat in the bacon is enough liquid to make it work.  And it is every bit as good as the canned bacon we used to get in the RP4s!  You could do a jar of it when you do a turkey, 100 minutes at 11 is close enough to 90 minutes at 10 pounds pressure. Doug"
1068120,akaShag,2020-12-04 20:46:00,2073,"and how about that bottled moose, eh!!!!!  Sorry for the hijack............ I just remembered, the usual Newfoundland bottled moose also gets a chunk of salt pork in it.  And I did venison one time with a tablespoon of sweet sherry, that was good too."
1068122,Sinker,2020-12-04 20:50:00,8692,"Yes, I use salt port, and don't add the salt. I also add onion and sometimes a clove or two of garlic. Depends what I plan to do with it, or who I'm giving it to lol S."
1068145,floater,2020-12-06 12:07:00,220,"I stated canning this year. I've got over 50 jars of salmon, smoked and plain. I canned some carrots but they are real squishy out of the jar. Did some beets and they are a little firmer than the carrots. Also canned some venison and it turned out great. Still trying to figure out how to eat the venison though. Right out of the jar is OK but I'd like to try and make some dairy free stroganoff. Very easy to can stuff as long as you follow the pressure and time guides."
1068157,smitty55,2020-12-06 18:50:00,928,"Floater if you want to try canning carrots again I highly recommend you try making dilled carrots. They stay crunchy for years, have great dill flavour and are also great with a hot pepper or two in the jar. They turn out best using baby carrots but I've used full sized ones too cut into spears. Easy to make as well and the recipe is per jar so you can make as many as you want at a time. Here's the recipe from the Jean Pare Company's Coming preserves book. Dilled carrots- double recipe  for quart jars 	head of dill, 1 per pint (more if you like) 	small clove of garlic, 1 per pint (I use way more lol) 	baby carrots or large ones cut into fingers, to fill 1 pint Hot peppers 1 per pint, two for quarts 	pickling salt, 1 Tbsp. per pint 	1/3 cup boiling white vinegar per pint 	Boiling water, to fill jar In a bottom of a hot sterilized pint jar, place head of dill and garlic. Fill with carrot sticks to within 1 inch of the top. 	Measure salt over carrots . Add vinegar. Fill with water to within 1/2 inch of top. 	Place sterilized metal lid on jar and screw metal band on finger tight only. Process in a boiling bath for 20 minutes Let stand 6 weeks before serving.  "
1068169,georginaisle,2020-12-06 21:25:00,42,"Just ordered a 22 quart pressure canner!! I'll be doing some canning best weekend Do you have to sterilize the jars,fill with meat and sauce and then pressure cook for about 100 minutes? "
1068170,georginaisle,2020-12-06 21:25:00,42,I basically meant do you have to pre sterilize the jars and then cook ii again?or can I just put the stuff in and then pressure cook it or do I have to sterilize the jars before that and then cook it?
1068171,akaShag,2020-12-06 21:30:00,2073,"Sterilize your jars first.  Or as an absolute minimum, start with squeaky clean jars.  Yes you are putting meat (with bacteria) into the jars, and yes the high heat is probably going to kill all the nasties, but it is not a big thing to start with clean jars. And always use NEW snap lids, they don't seal properly if they are re-used. Good luck to you! Doug"

1068341,Canuck,2020-12-12 13:01:00,491,"Its really important not to get anything spilled on the top edges of the jars or on the sealing lids when you are filling them or the seal will not last.  Be careful not to overfill the jars and if you spill on the edges or lids, you have to clean it really, really well.  And never, ever reuse the sealing lids.  If the seals leak at all, your hard work will be ruined and you can get sick or die from botulism.  Home canning is great, but its not a place to take shortcuts on food safety."

1068026,AKRISONER,2020-12-02 14:20:00,5558,this is quite literally my brother in laws favourite meal. He doesnt hunt but hes lucky enough that his uncles throw him a few jars a year. He saves them for special occasions.
1068029,mamona,2020-12-02 15:10:00,597,I am guessing no one is selling bottled moose?
1068037,Fisherman,2020-12-02 23:05:00,7201,"Hahahaha, ah, nooo.   That would be like getting a freebie at the local floosie house."

1068082,akaShag,2020-12-04 01:41:00,2073,"Yes, I have canned moose, deer, goose, etc etc etc for decades.  They call it canning even though we use Mason jars.  But in Newfoundland (and probably other places) they do call it (quite properly) bottled moose. Take raw moose, trim off fat and gristle, and cut it into cubes or chunks about 3/4"".  Smaller works fine, bigger not so much.  Season it with your favourite seasonings - always seasoning salt and garlic, then whatever tickles your fancy.  About a heaping tablespoon of raw onion is quite good.  If you put onion in the jar, put it about half-way down in the meat. Pack the seasoned meat into clean Mason jars, probably 250 ml but possibly 500 ml or even 1 litre, but a litre of bottled moose is a hell of a lot of meat.  Pack it in quite tightly to within about half an inch of the top, add a quarter teaspoon of seasoned salt on top, wipe the jar rims, and top with hot sealing lids.  Tighten the sealing rings down snug but not over-tight.  Process in a pressure canner for 90 minutes at 10 pounds pressure, and allow the pressure to drop to zero before opening the canner.  Use jar tongs to remove the jars from the hot water, and place on a cookie sheet or similar, on a heat-proof surface, and allow them to cool.  The lids should ""pop"" when they seal.  Allow to cool completely and check that all of the jars did seal.  If you have one that did not seal, put it in the fridge and eat it within a week or so.  Take the sealed jars, tighten the sealing rings securely, and store in your pantry.  It will keep for several years with no change in quality. This is the standard way to pressure can red meat.  It sounds like the OP got some that was done in a hot pack, with liquid.  DIFFERENT process entirely, starting with hot product and hot jars, but fill and process the same way. Doug"
1068086,misfish,2020-12-04 09:58:00,29133,"Told ya,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,LOL"
1068088,Fisherman,2020-12-04 13:52:00,7201,"Have to agree, a 1 litre or quart size mason jar is a lot.  I use 1 litre jars of canned turkey to make 4 turkey pot pies at a time.   250's are my go to for canned salmon and rainbow."
1068089,akaShag,2020-12-04 13:57:00,2073,"Do you do a hot pack with the turkey?  As in, boned-out cooked turkey with broth?"
1068090,Fisherman,2020-12-04 13:59:00,7201,"Yes,  pressure cooked, deboned, skin off, with broth, hot packed, 100 mins at 11 psi."

1068099,georginaisle,2020-12-04 15:25:00,42,I'm going to buy some eye of round and do a practice round before I do the moose...I don't wanna screw it up
1068100,Sinker,2020-12-04 15:32:00,8692,"Its almost impossible to screw it up. Always use new sealers. Sterilize your bottles well. Google has all the info you need. I basically do the same as Doug above, and you can put anything you want in those bottles....we do fish, deer, moose, seal, rabbits, crab, lobster, mussels, clams....I could keep going but i wont lol S."
1068101,Fisherman,2020-12-04 15:35:00,7201,"Just follow the canning directions to a ""T"" and you'll be fine.  Important thing is to leave that 1 inch open space at the top of the jar and do not screw the lids down like a gorilla.  Barely finger tight, the steam has to escape from the jar during the process of canning,  The lids will suck themselves down tight,  I don't retighten the rings afterwards,  I've never had one pop open.  Also be aware not to put hot jars into water in the pressure canner that's cooler than the jars if you are doing a hot load."
1068102,Fisherman,2020-12-04 15:35:00,7201,"Ah, you beat me, lol."
1068103,Fisherman,2020-12-04 15:36:00,7201,I also made some apple sauce jars and carrots just to see how they turn out.  Worked very well.
1068108,akaShag,2020-12-04 17:07:00,2073,"The canned item that still makes me giddy is canned side bacon.  And it's AWESOME!  The last time I used COSTCO maple flavoured bacon, the big double pack, and cut the slices in half to fit the jars.  It worked well, and I needed less weight of raw bacon to make a canner load. And my recipe: CANNED BACON  (February 2016)  Buy premium bacon to make this.  A 5 kg/11 lb box is about right for a canner load.  Lay the strips of bacon on aluminum foil, or parchment paper, on cookie sheets in a single layer.  Clean-up is about the same for foil and for parchment paper, but the latter is wider and covers larger pans better. Cook the bacon in the oven at 375 for about 20 minutes per pan, until just about fully cooked but not crispy.  Cooking bacon in the oven keeps the slices nice and flat.  Drain the slices of bacon on paper towel and allow to cool.  Take about 24” of parchment paper, cut off the top 2” or so, and lay bacon strips side by side (some overlap is OK) to about the 21” mark or so.  The strips should be about ½” shorter than a 500 ml Mason jar, so trim to length with a knife.  At this point, with the bacon laid out flat, you can brush it with maple syrup or other flavourings.  Fold the parchment paper top and bottom over the bacon, then roll it tightly towards the paper end.  It should fit snugly into the (wide mouth!) Mason jar – if it is too tight remove a slice or two, if it is too loose add a slice or two.  Take the off-cuts and place them in a shallow jar like a salmon jar that will fit on top of the 500 ml jars in the canner.  These pieces, NOT in parchment paper, will be used as bacon bits or whatever.  Process the jars at 10 lb pressure for 90 minutes.  The jars should seal with no problems, and when cooled off there will be a bit of bacon fat in the bottom of the jars.  To use the bacon, open a jar and it can be eaten directly or warmed in the microwave for a few seconds and then eaten like regular cooked bacon.  My first batch lasted just fine for over three years in my pantry.  It’s DELICIOUS!
