1068994,KraTToR,2021-01-01 16:18:00,506,Does anyone know if LOB is safe for ice fishing yet? TIA< P.
1069007,Rizzo,2021-01-01 21:01:00,4754,"I don't know that body of water but there was a solid 4 inches of ice right here in Guelph, maybe a bit more"
1069028,John,2021-01-02 14:26:00,2956,Where are you fishing in Guelph Rizzo?
1069029,Tjames09,2021-01-02 14:26:00,664,"Those northern muskoka lakes usually freeze up late, and its been mild. Check the satellite views and see.  https://worldview.earthdata.nasa.gov/?v=-80.89900582963331,44.028951230569994,-77.78746108182732,45.60633155411053&t=2020-12-29-T08%3A00%3A00Z  looks wide open to me. along with simcoe and the other Muskoka lakes."
1069030,John,2021-01-02 14:27:00,2956,I will check with my cousin but doubt LOB's has safe ice.
1069031,Rizzo,2021-01-02 14:38:00,4754,Not on Guelph Lake...just a local pond. Although I think there are some people trying parts of Guelph Lake. Guys have been fishing Belwood as well
1069036,AKRISONER,2021-01-02 15:38:00,5558,Ya...ice is nowhere near good up north. Tiny baxk lakes have about 4-5 and anything else is basically open. I doubt lake of bays has ice at all too be honest
1069039,Rizzo,2021-01-02 17:50:00,4754,time to get the boat out apparently!
