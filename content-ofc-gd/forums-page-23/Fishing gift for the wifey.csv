1068176,captpierre,2020-12-07 02:54:00,2521,I asked her which rod and reel combo she wants for Christmas. Â She doesnâ€™t fish ðŸ˜Ž
1068184,mamona,2020-12-07 14:50:00,597,What did she say?
1068190,Fisherman,2020-12-07 15:46:00,7201,How about a fillet knife and cleaning board.Â  Just sleep with one eye open after the 25th of Dec.
1068191,captpierre,2020-12-07 16:22:00,2521,I really should reduce the life insurance on my head
1068352,Rizzo,2020-12-13 00:00:00,4754,"ya I saw the title here and thought ""oh man...he is doomed"". You can buy fishing stuff for the wife, it just better not be on Christmas, anniversary or birthday."
1068353,Rizzo,2020-12-13 00:01:00,4754,...or valentines....DEFINITELY not Valentine's day!
1068358,Sinker,2020-12-13 14:23:00,8692,"You guys have it all wrong. My wife would RATHER fishing gear than most other things! The problem is, when we go fishing, she kicks my A$$...... S."
1068361,Weeds,2020-12-13 16:37:00,782,All wives love musky gear. Sometimes you just have to spoil them; something like a 400 dollar St. Croix rod should do. Expensive? Perhaps. But the look on her face will be priceless.
1068451,Rizzo,2020-12-16 01:38:00,4754,haha oh ya my wife would have a look alright
1068452,LefroyFisherman,2020-12-16 01:42:00,602,It would have been better for us if you had just gotten her a nice expensive rod and reel and posted the video of her unwrapping
1068462,Old Ironmaker,2020-12-16 10:49:00,8243,"Around 28 years ago I bought my lady a Shimano spinning rod for her birthday that I would never spend on a rod for myself. Once in a while she asks ""Is that my rod Johnny?."""
1068470,Big Cliff,2020-12-16 13:29:00,6899,"You young guys have it all wrong.... first you buy her something you KNOW she would really like (the more expensive the better) and you wrap it up and put it under the tree but mark it ""from santa"". Then you buy whatever it is that you really wanted (if you are smart it will be worth a little less than wife's gift) put that under the tree and act all surprised when she opens hers and then you open yours. ðŸ˜Š Don't ask me how I know but it works every time. You are welcome ðŸ˜‰ "
1068471,captpierre,2020-12-16 13:35:00,2521,"Genius, Cliff. ðŸ˜Ž. Where were you Â in â€˜85 when I needed this marital counseling?"
1068548,akaShag,2020-12-17 21:23:00,2073,"I bought my wife a Paderno 16 quart heavy stainless stock pot for Christmas this year.  She doesn't cook.  But I do, and the inaugural pot of Dr Doug's Delightful Cream of Carrot Soup with Pear and Curry is cooling now.ðŸ˜‰ Doug"
