1068928,gordy28,2020-12-29 22:16:00,638,Took a wee bit of a holiday break but newest post is up It's a confession of sorts  - I love a good fishing spot nick name. I was born the son of a spot namer and my Mom's Dad was also a prolific spot namer Post covers my lineage and some of my favorites from the Kawarthas to Sioux Lookout and even includes a video of a bear lol https://www.northernjacks.com/post/great-spots Cheers and thanks for reading Andrew 
1068931,Rizzo,2020-12-30 00:06:00,4754,"Good read. I am not a spot-namer, but a lure namer. Others in my boat end up end up doing the same. You might hear lures by the name of Lady Gaga, Tinseltown, Squidward, Big Blackie, Blondie, Mighty Whitie, to name a few if on board with me"
1068946,gordy28,2020-12-30 20:24:00,638,Nice!   I can’t say I have named a lot of lures although I am certainly guilty of staying fixated on one lure for way to long. After one epic day on Balsam w a hot head x rap I swear I started with that lure every time I fished for smallies for at least 3 years.   Then it was the wacky rig and now it’s probably the ned rig.  Maybe it just makes me loyal Andrew
1068947,tender52,2020-12-30 20:59:00,270,Big time spot name'er here. Connies hole. 40 run. Little Ti++ie island. Narrows. ( it has nothing to do with narrows) K bay. Its about 150km north of simcoe.  Myself and 3 buddies have 100s of names for the spots we would go.

1069037,gordy28,2021-01-02 15:49:00,638,Lol.  When I was a kid my dream boat was this Prinecraft side console with a 70 horse Johnson on the back.    It’s name was the Bassin Assassin.   Think I loved the name the most
