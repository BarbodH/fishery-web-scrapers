1069226,Dutch01,2021-01-07 23:04:00,1431,"I spoke directly to an OPP Officer at a local detachment today.  She tried to maintain the party line (""Travel is not recommended at this time"") but I boxed her in and she conceded there is no specific law against travel in Ontario at this time. I recommend anyone who is unsure or prefers to do their own due diligence call their local detachment.  It is a quick call and confirms what you want to know directly from the horses mouth."
