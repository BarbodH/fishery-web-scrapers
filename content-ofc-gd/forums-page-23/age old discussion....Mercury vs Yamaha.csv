1067967,AKRISONER,2020-11-30 16:38:00,5558,im excited just to get the package in the mail and have a project for the boat for the winter in my new garage  😁
1067968,Terry,2020-11-30 16:47:00,14456,I used mine all summer and it’s great trolling I use it as autopilot Casting I fished a weed line and did well so the next day I went to the same spot hit follow track and it steered the whole way for me    	put it on charge for the night but looked half an hour later and the batteries were already fully charged  
1068238,chessy,2020-12-08 17:03:00,610,"well I bought a 2021 Lund with a 150 merc and a 9.9 kicker and a ulttera trolling motor .. started my 9,9 and gas was everywhere took it to closest dealer they said we aint looking at it its not on. a prince craft boat.. took it to 2 other dealers in area and they said nope you did not buy here .. took it to another dealer they called merc and they said yup its a issue some of our motors left with out all the parts in the caberators ..... waited 30 days for parts blew my walleye season my ullterra motor deployed once then would not deploy again now I have to take it off boat and send back for warrantee..... another 2 hour drive to a warranty centre ...... "
1068244,AKRISONER,2020-12-08 18:58:00,5558,I swear to god that Minkotta and Johnson controls have switched their manufacturing facilities in the past 10 years. The old powerdrives and fortrexes were basically ready to use for close to 20 years...now you are lucky to have one that lasts 5. Heck every single person i know thats bought an ultrex has had it fail and they have only been out a total of 3 years now...
1068274,Sinker,2020-12-09 20:39:00,8692,"I bought a new powerdrive ipilot this year, so far so good, but I kept my old V1 powerdrive just in case. The old girl still works like the day i got it lol"
1068276,AKRISONER,2020-12-09 21:23:00,5558,"my powerdrive v1 died 2 years ago..understandably the foot pedal fried, but it had done its job long enough...so what I did was actually buy my father a new 80lb terrova v2 for his new boat so that I could take his 55lb powerdrive ipilot for my tinner. Then I bought my own boat that came with an old motorguide tour...I sold that to finance a 80lb terrova with ipilot for myself because how I fish...there is no way in hell im trying to dance on a TM while drop shotting smallies in great lakes winds...its just a no go. All should be fine and dandy right? Covid hits, my big boat is now grounded because all of the launches are closed so I take the old trust tinner out with the powerdrive ipilot...it fries the controller its dead...then my old man running his new terrova bumps a rock with the skeg of his motor and it breaks the flimsy mounting clip on his shaft up by the head??? so that his motor now slips and wont always engage when you turn it. And then the fall arrives and my Terrova fries itself, I buy a brand new pedal for it and it lasts one day and fries itself again. I take it to aikmans he cant see anything wrong with the motor except for the fact that if you use it for more than 8 hours it will fry your brand new pedals every single time.  Thats 4 minkottas broken in 3 years and only one could technically be blamed on the user for bumping a rock with the skeg...Im done...Theres a Garmin Force sitting in my garage ready to be installed if we get a stretch of warmer weather at some point."
1068281,tomkat,2020-12-09 22:07:00,246,I’ve had both and no complaints from either. I have Yamaha 50hp tiller now and I really like it. The tiller arm is great
1068291,Fish Farmer,2020-12-10 13:18:00,2234,"Yep, I had a Honda and now a Merc Tohatsu. The merc is much more quiet. If I was going to buy again I'd be looking at a Suzuki. From what I've read they are so much more advanced than the rest."
1068296,Garnet,2020-12-10 14:52:00,2056,Suzuki would interest me but no local dealers would likely kill the idea.
1068297,Sinker,2020-12-10 15:11:00,8692,Theres one in port perry. https://www.lakeviewmarine.com/
1068305,irishfield,2020-12-10 16:22:00,26272,Marsh Marine in Waubashene.
1068321,Garnet,2020-12-11 12:21:00,2056,Marsh has been a Suzuki guys for 2 decades  to far for me. Lakeview Marina is absolute no for me. I have a Merc 200 Opti so not in market now but I listen when people talk.
1068672,Walltrout,2020-12-20 14:16:00,18,Many years ago I purchased my first outboard..........a bright and shinny Merc. Then I got a real job and purchased a real outboard..........now I have a bright and shinny black boat anchor that nobody wants. Merc is short for Many Efforts Repairing Crap.
1068973,Hack_Fisherman,2020-12-31 21:48:00,720,"But no Yammy exp? I’m a Toyota owner and about to pickup a 4Runner. There is a reason for it as they routinely pass 400+ on factory drivelines. Kijiji is chock full of US trucks and SUV’s with motors or transmissions that couldn’t reach 300k, or were nearly dead. Japanese mfg has always been better (IMO) I’m into Johnnyrudes right now, but the big switch down the road will only be Yammy, Suzuki or Honda only"
1069128,lovetofish,2021-01-04 23:27:00,500,"I bought my 15hp 4 stroke merc in 2016. It’s been flawless and it doesn’t burn any gas. At all, it’s incredible"
1067823,bigcreekdad,2020-11-26 13:51:00,546,"My son and I are toying with sharing the cost of a new tiller boat. We're pretty much down to three aluminum manufacturers, and would take any of them. It seems as all the boat packages you can order come only with Mercs. Having had two superb trouble free Yamaha 4 strokes in the last 21 seasons, I am reluctant to change to a Merc. In my childhood on Lake Erie, we had two mercs and they were troublesome. That's a while ago obviously, but, more recently (12 years), a pretty well known guide in the Sanibel Island Florida we were fishing with said the guides referred to Mercs as ""black anchors"". On the other hand, I have a few friends that bought mercs in the last few years and they are pleased with them. We could order a boat and trailer only, and have a Yamaha installed, but that is a bit more costly than ordering a package with a merc. As I said, this is an old discussion, but I'd be curious to hear from any recent (5 years or less) Mercury buyers if they have any thoughts. Especially if they previously had a Yamaha."
1067826,Terry,2020-11-26 14:00:00,14456,"I have owned both and I have no problem buying either. 2014 I bought a 125 merc and a 9.9 merc.   Never a problem  and I am hard on equipment  but for some reason Yamaha owners are like tundra truck owners no matter what ,they believe they are the best nothing else like them and he will show you how great they are as soon as they get it back from the shop they are good machines but if you google them they have problems just like the others"
1067828,fisherman7,2020-11-26 14:18:00,325,"I've owned both over the years and have decided that the only engine on my boat will be a grey one. Preferably Yamaha but Honda is a close second. If you ever are down south, all you'll see is Yamaha."
1067829,AKRISONER,2020-11-26 14:30:00,5558,"if you are ever in mexico, cuba or even australia...all you will see is yamahas. The mexicans and cubans cant deal with their outboards breaking. My family in the past 6 years has owned a johnson, a mercury, a suzuki and 2 yamaha outboards. The Johnson is dead, the mercury is in the shop as we speak the suzuki and two yamahas havent had a single issue. My 2 stroke yamaha is a 98, bone stock...perfect compression, doesnt smoke much and starts easily."
1067837,Fisherman,2020-11-26 16:36:00,7201,"Yamaha by a long lead.  Honda a tight second.  they don't call Mercs black anchors for nothing, they're even too cheap to throw in the anchor line."
1067838,Moosebunk,2020-11-26 16:58:00,3970,"NOBODY uses Mercs or prefers them in the remote parts of Northern Ontario and Arctic where I've worked and lived.  Wait... I take that back, I've seen two or three I think in 20 years. It's all Yamaha and Honda with the odd Rude where reliability is needed most, if it was Merc, then I'd surely think that many people in the northern communities with less money to go around would choose them."
1067839,Sinker,2020-11-26 17:13:00,8692,"Yammy hands down no question. Have  you ever met an unhappy yamaha owner? I haven't. All my stuff is yammy, and I have never been let down, never had a single issue with any of it. Sleds, bikes, and outboards......even guitars, speakers, PA systems....lol S."
1067844,Garnet,2020-11-26 18:40:00,2056,I can think of 5-7 guys that couldn't get rid of there Yammaha fast enough. Can also think of same number Merc owners . Rudes same . Suzuki same. Should I go on. They all have problems. They all need Mechanics. Merc dealer every town and many many Merc mechanics. What ever you choose hope for good motor.
1067847,BillM,2020-11-26 19:12:00,17367,"I've got a 17 year old Yami 115 strapped to the back of my Lund.  I don't need any convincing that's the only engine brand I'll ever run, lol."
1067848,Fisherman,2020-11-26 19:14:00,7201,Merc dealer every town and many many Merc mechanics.  To try and keep them running.
1067849,irishfield,2020-11-26 20:16:00,26272,"Yamaha, Honda, Merc.. same yackidy yack as Ford, Dodge, GMC... Flawless... 13 years now. Nothing but the odd oil change, and have never even pulled the spark plugs..  "
1067850,Sinker,2020-11-26 20:23:00,8692,I put more hours on my yammy in a month than you have on that old thing!!! 
1067851,Sinker,2020-11-26 20:26:00,8692,"I re-powered my boat last  year with a new yamaha, but my 1993 40hp 2 stroke yammy still runs like the day I got it. I still have it sitting in my garage. Can't bring myself to let it go. I know for sure I could hook it up to muffs and it would start on the 5th pull.... lol S."
1067856,Hack_Fisherman,2020-11-26 22:49:00,720,"There will always be the same thing as the Ford/GM/Dodge argument. I’m using a 45 year old Merc that I just pulled to put out to pasture. Would I buy another, sorry...Yammy, Honda or Zuki if new. Used? Can’t find one. Nothing out there this year. What’s that tell you? Lots of dead or tired OMC or Mercs out there. Especially VRO OMCs with wasted power heads.  "
1067866,John Bacon,2020-11-26 23:54:00,3277,"Have you looked at G3 boats?  They're owned by Yamaha, so you should be able to get a package.  	But, yeah, most of the other boats seem to be either owned by, or otherwise associated with Mercury."
1067879,porkpie,2020-11-27 04:33:00,2521,"I'm pretty happy with my Suzuki.  I would never buy a yamaha again, not because they make bad motors.  But there is a good chance Yamaha Canada will screw you on warranty in the unlikely event you ever need it.  I found this out with the motor on a duckboat.  And no, it wasn't a dealer issue, I saw all the paper trails and eventually ended up dealing with Yamaha Canada myself also.  Yamaha Canada wouldn't honor their warranty, it was astounding.  So, while they make a ton of good products, including my ATV that is  in my opinion probably bullet proof, they've lost me entirely and for good.  I'd spend my money on Suzuki or Honda, both of which I've owned and they start, run and perform all the time.  Many commercial fishermen regularly get 5000-6000 hours on zuke outboards.  As for use, I tend to believe that it has a lot to do with the long term ""reliability"" of wear items.  Every time I hear a guy claim he gets 8 or 9 years out of deep cycles for his minn kota, I know he either doesn't use the minn kota much, or the boat doesn't get wet much.  Anyway I'm not big on Mercs as that's the only motor I've ever had to get towed in on but that's just one mans opinion and any motor can have a bad day."
1067893,Sinker,2020-11-27 21:18:00,8692,I could be swayed into a suzi. They are also great engines. S.
1067896,Tjames09,2020-11-27 21:42:00,664,"I had a 2011 Mercury and it ran amazing, never had a single issue. Oil change at end of year thats it."
1067914,Garnet,2020-11-28 11:27:00,2056,"My last Merc 13 years of hard tournament fishing hardly seen a mechanic. It's just luck. Bill is 15 years on 115 yammy, I have a buddy with 115 Yammy blew up got in the US Yammy Canada Yammy crap. Factory re build and grenade on start up . Complete block replace got it going. They all have problems. Check your available repair shops. The most important thing to remember there's 2 motors 1 is blown up and 2 is going to blow up."
1067915,lew,2020-11-28 13:38:00,12766,I bought a new 90HP Merc 4 stroke in 1999 and put a ton of hours on it over the next 10 years and never had a single issue with it. I sold it to a bud in 2009 and he drove it for another 7 or so years before it needed it's 1st repair. I'd say 17 problem free years is pretty darned impressive. I bought a new 150 Yamaha 4 stroke in 2010 and drove that one for 7 years before I quit fishing but they were also problem free years when I sold it. I've always figured if you take care of your gear and keep it well maintained it'll last you a long time.
1067916,Whopper,2020-11-28 14:56:00,2174,"Bingo, give this man a cigar"
1067917,Spiel,2020-11-28 15:13:00,9065,"Bought new in 2006, 75 tiller, no complaints what so ever. Starts instantly every time and runs quieter than the Honda, right Fish Farmer. "
1067934,Garnet,2020-11-29 11:01:00,2056,So a Merc story a buddy bought a 1999 225 EFI Merc. First year good. Then problems cutting cylinders back wouldn't run. Trip after trip to dealer they changed everything I made sure he got a binder and kept all info. Had the factory tech from Merc Mississauga out 3 times. Thing wouldn't work. I told him I would take it to Merc Mississauga un bolt and leave it there. He did 1 better went in and ask to borrow wrenches. Had a meeting with the #1 Merc guy in Ontario. They went all threw ever attempt to fix. The exec said he estimated 200K man hours and parts. Sent it for 1 last attempt. They found factory parts mix up and some damage in trying to repair it. About 3 years.. They all have problems.
1067955,AKRISONER,2020-11-30 14:01:00,5558,Johnson controls and minkotta is another company and a whole other story to talk about...I finally gave up on them this year after breaking 4 trolling motors in 3 years. Then you talk to what seems like at least 50% of ultrex owners and the steering cable issues with them it’s embarrassing. im hoping the ridiculous amount of money I’ve spent on a new Garmin troller will at least hold up 
1067957,Terry,2020-11-30 14:47:00,14456,Yeah but garmin is so quiet and uses so little power.    I’m sure it will last for years cause I have one too
