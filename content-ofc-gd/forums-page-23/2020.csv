1067731,msp,2020-11-24 01:56:00,1336,"Despite 2020 being a complete $hit show, I had some fun out there on the water.  	was a later than normal open water season for pike but we did well teaching the young lads how to fish for spring pike. Explaining the finer points of jerkbaits to the kids it was fun watching them hone in on their new found skill.  	bass fishing was hit and miss for me this year. I fished a total of 8 new lakes this summer which took up most of my bass season. Some a complete waste of time, some still on the radar for further exploration next summer. My typical late season largemouth trips went right up until November 22 and may extend to one more trip. Possibly a couple trips to the mighty Niagara coming up soon but with the borders closed and no drifting allowed on the US side I may focus back on pike to round out the season. Here is my best fish porn of 2020. Enjoy                      "

1067735,Terry,2020-11-24 02:46:00,14456,Man. Do you only catch big fish lol nice going
1067736,Old Ironmaker,2020-11-24 02:51:00,8243,"Some mighty fine fish you have there dear Sir. My favorite is the pic of the young lad with the smile on his face. I threw a few lines out, caught a few Smallies but for one reason (excuse) or another didn't get the bottom of the boat wet. 2020 sucked, no 2 ways about it, it was the most dismal year in my 66 years, absolutly terrible but no where nearly as bad as some that had to suffer in an intensive care ward, alone, then die, alone. It puts fishing on the bottom of a long list of important things in life, like life itself."
1067737,BillM,2020-11-24 03:05:00,17367,Let's hope those US drifts open back up or it's going to be a traffic jam on the Canadian side    I have a feeling they won't be though.

1068385,Cando,2020-12-14 00:43:00,90,"Wow nice catch. This is the 1st year I never caught a fish since I can remember, but, I only got out 2 days for a total of 4 hours. Hopefully 2021 will be more productive. I don't plan on missing opening walleye season again this year."
