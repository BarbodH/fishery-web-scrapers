1069165,plowjock,2021-01-06 19:15:00,4,"I think a lot of your issues with corrosion is because you are connecting your ring type connectors which is one type of metal with a stainless bolt or split copper connector. Two different types of metal connected together, are going to set up a barrier which will result in corrosion. Your split rings on the Garmin end of wire are one material and your brass or stainless bolt is another. Problems will follow definitely."
1069167,Sinker,2021-01-06 20:32:00,8692,"I used these on my boat. Soldered the pieces to the wires, shrinkwrapped, then when I put the wires into the plugs, I shrinkwrapped those too, twice. Been that way for years and never had an issue. You can get larger sizes of these quick connects that would work on your Garmin ends as well. Any electrical supply shop will have them. My battery guy called them forklift plugs. You could also get a block similar to what Dan posted above, but way better quality from a car audio shop. They have great 12v connectors and the like that are gold plated etc....they aren't cheap, but do it once right and be done.  S.  "
1069173,DanD,2021-01-06 22:34:00,2223,"The fix for that are called washers. Sorry but you're over thinking this. Make tight and water resistant concoctions as best you can and forget about it for the next 4 or 5 years. After that revisit it and clean or replace connections. I don't give a rats ass what you do to insulate these connections; mother nature will get in there eventually and have her way with it. Copper wire, connector (whatever) composition, electricity and moister; there's going to be corrosion eventually; just deal with it during annual maintenance. Dan."
1069183,Garnet,2021-01-07 11:31:00,2056,"I've been reading this thread and wondering what's the point. Why the push to remove plug, any problems with the plug you are just moving to a suspect connection. And strollers break unplug remove from boat and get repair."
1069185,Musky Plug,2021-01-07 13:50:00,398,Have to agree with this. Just seems more practical imo.
1069189,Sinker,2021-01-07 14:18:00,8692,"The plug is always the problem area. For me anyways. Anytime my bowmount didn't want to work, it was the plug. S."
1069192,AKRISONER,2021-01-07 14:34:00,5558,The new motor doesn’t come with a plug. You can buy one but that would also entail totally re-fabricating the access panel that I have on the front of my boat. Plus the plug is an extra $110usd for something I will have no use for. I’ve got a battery shut off back at my batteries to cut power if need be. also see earlier story about my experience with plugs and the set screws attempting to hold 6 guage wire.
1069247,Garnet,2021-01-08 11:15:00,2056,But you are thinking of installing a bolt and covering it with rudder. Now the only way to test connection is forcing hole in cable leaving a source for moister. That you installed plug badly previously means you won't do that again. And the the hubble plug few screws and all fixed up. And it is funny you spend thousands of dollars on trolling motor and draw the line at $110.
1069258,410001661,2021-01-08 18:29:00,127,"The only thing with a split bolt is after you ruse rubber tape to fill in the voids and then electrical tape there is no way to re-tighten without taking it all apart and it does get messy.  I have used hundreds of these to connect electrical services - since then the industry has moved away from these to an in-line crimp connection. Personally - I would recommend two methods.  Re-terminate the two conductors with cable lugs (with the same hole opening) and then bolt them together and use heat shrink tube over the entire connection, or my personal choice would be a multi-tap connector (two barrel) and terminate both conductors.  The wire range is #14-#4AWG copper or aluminum and you can visually inspect the connection and retighten if required without any issues. https://www.panduit.com/en/products/wire-termination/lugs-splices-split-bolts-accessories/mechanical-compression-lugs-splices/pcsb4212y.html  "
1069262,AKRISONER,2021-01-08 20:47:00,5558,You make a good point. the bad connection on the Kota although I’d normally blame myself was actually how poorly the Kota receptacle was designed. I ended up scrapping the thing and switching to an industrial locking  240 style set up at the recommendation of an electrician that I know. Sure enough the set screw set up on those made wayyyy more sense and didn’t cause fraying and made a really tight clean connection.
1069462,Fishing Rod,2021-01-13 16:41:00,5,I used a bolt then adhesive shrink wrap. On the positive connection I taped a clear hose over it to keep the 2 connections from rubbing against each other.

1069104,AKRISONER,2021-01-04 14:20:00,5558,"Hey guys, I’m looking for some advice on how to set up the wiring for my trolling motor like an electrician would do it. With trolling new Troller’s now having an on and off switch ive decided to do away with having a plug on my trolling motor and I am just going to directly  connect my run of power wire to my trolling motor power wire. The easy way to do this is to simply connect the hot positive line to its circuit breaker...done deal. but then connecting the two negatives and their ring terminals together is where I’m wondering what those that are experts would suggest? ive seen suggestions of simply using a bolt? The problem with regular hardware bolts is that they are usually made of crappy metal and will corrode like crazy. (If there’s one thing I’ve learned through this process of owning a boat for a few years is that if it can corrode it will) heck, the mounting bolts from the trolling motor I installed 2 years ago are a mess. Wiring for a navigation light that I did last year that didn’t get shrink tube for whatever reason and was taped was totally corroded when I took it apart. Lesson learned!  so what is everyone’s suggestion, is there a smart way to make the negative connection? Is putting yet another marine circuit breaker on the negative line and using it as the connector for my ring terminals? What do the pros here suggest? "
1069105,Terry,2021-01-04 14:26:00,14456,"I did mine with a bolt and taped the crap out of it.  A copper nut and bolt would be best  oh and it takes a while for the gps satellites to lock and the WiFi to the pedal or remote. So if you are stopping at a spot you want to fish right away or need control fast , turn on the trolling motor on  before you get to your spot"
1069106,AKRISONER,2021-01-04 15:06:00,5558,"Ya terry, this is what I’m trying to avoid...I guess the moisture of a wet boat just eats away at anything taped in my boat. Tape also scares me because it always degrades over time especially in the cold. if I end up going to bolt route, does anyone have a recommendation on where to get non corroding bolts that would fit in my ring terminals nicely? ive had an electrical fire once on my trolling motor wires due to vibration breaking strands and causing a resistance to build up. I’m trying to do this 100% perfectly to avoid that from happening again!"
1069107,David Chong,2021-01-04 15:50:00,836,Are you connecting the negative feed from your batteries to the negative on your troller? I would just use a shrink wrap connector!
1069109,AKRISONER,2021-01-04 16:03:00,5558,Hey dave...this would be the ideal thing to do..except for the fact that the garmin force is a 2 wire per feed system (4 wires total) which are nicely put together by garmin as a 2 wire to 1 ring terminal set up. I think this is so that the GPS and trolling motor electronics have their own power feed separate from the electric motor itself. But then obviously my boat wiring is only single wire (two wires total) therefore not allowing for me to simply crimp and shrink tube connect them together.

1069111,AKRISONER,2021-01-04 16:11:00,5558,"this is exactly why i posted here...although it doesnt ""solve"" my problem, it has now made me aware of something that I had absolutely no idea existed. My amazon order has already been placed! although maybe it does if I am going to use a bolt to make the connection. Do you find that the stuff comes off with a razor blade should I ever need to disconnect?"
1069112,Fisherman,2021-01-04 16:39:00,7201,Yes you can get it off again.
1069113,David Chong,2021-01-04 16:43:00,836,Fisherman's suggestion & solution is great! Bolt the wires together and apply multiple layers of the liquid tape! I've used this before and it works great!
1069114,ch312,2021-01-04 16:49:00,1590,"Cut the rings off then solder and waterproof shrink wrap for peace of mind connections. Yes, waterproof stuff is much better than standard wrap.  "

1069118,ch312,2021-01-04 17:22:00,1590,"You can solder/shrink wrap any number of wires, just be sure to use the right size wrap. Cleaner and less redneck of a solution, although the bolt/nut method will work too.  Just depends on personal preference really.  "
1069119,smitty55,2021-01-04 19:22:00,928,"I would look into environmental splices like are used in the aircraft industry. There are two styles, one uses a butt style crimp and then has the shrink tube with a sealer on each end. The other style like I've used on engine harnesses has an integrated solder ring in the middle of the shrink tube again with a sealer ring on each end that melts and provides a much better seal than standard shrink sleeving. In your case I would think that the solder connection would be preferable to a crimp. With larger wires I've found that it helps to tin the wires first. You will need a quality heat gun that will melt the solder and is generally used with a U shaped attachment on the end of the heat gun so that it reflects the heat on the backside of the splice at the same time"

1069137,Yellow Fever,2021-01-05 00:06:00,139,"So....I do a lot of boat wiring, The worst thing is electric tape. If you use marine grade wire it will not corrode. The absolutely best way is to use the appropriate size ring terminals and you can crimp them on AND then solder them should you want. Absolutely use quality heat shrink ( the kind that has the sealant ) My biggest concern with your plan ( I may have missed it but read it twice ) is that your motor is always going to have power to it. I would install a breaker for sure for safety and to eliminate motor or GPS draw. Also don't most manufacturers want the motor NOT connected to power when charging. Do it right once and you will never have to worry"
1069143,AKRISONER,2021-01-05 02:27:00,5558,"I really wish I could use one of those prefabbed butt connectors but unfortunately the connection is with 2 (8 AWG)? strands coming from the trolling motor to one on the main power (6 awg) supply lines coming from the battery. yellow...indeed there is such a noticeable difference between proper marine wire and non...every time I’ve replaced a wire in my boat has been slowly turning over to marine wire. The difference is pretty incredible tbh. Luckily I invested in quality marine grade wire when I installed my last trolling motor on the boat. Interestingly Garmin actually recommends directly hardwiring the motor to your batteries. As strange is that is because minkotta recommends unplugging your motor when charging your boat, meanwhile Garmin’s instructions are to hardwire it. It actually somewhat shocked me as well. I think I’m going to end up going the bolt and nut route. Shrink tube it as much as possible and then paint the heck out it with liquid electrical tape. now the pain is sourcing a brass/stainless bolt and nut during a lockdown where I can’t go to the store and actually see what I’m buying lol."

1069148,aplumma,2021-01-05 13:45:00,6896,You can use a wire lug that is the correct way to splice large wires. They are used in electrical splices up to three phase connections. They can then be covered with NOlox a compound designed to prevent corrosion and then taped up with high voltage tape which is stretchy and seals to itself. This is not like the electrical tape you use which is thin and plastic it is the rubber type of tape.  Art 
1069153,FILTHY OAR,2021-01-05 19:45:00,65,"Do what Aplumma suggested, it's called a copper split bolt, also the rubber tape he is talking about is called rubber splicing tape, you can find both of these items at your local Electrical distributor."

1069161,AKRISONER,2021-01-06 16:08:00,5558,"Dan I thought about simply using a terminal box but then realized that I may run into issues due to the large ring terminal sizes that I am using. That would have been most handy for sure. I am sure i could find an appropriate terminal box if i searched hard enough, but then at that point is there really any difference between that and using a stainless bolt? The Split bolt seems like the perfect solution for smaller guage wire or single strand wire I have some concerns with using a split bolt and 3 6AWG wires in a boat application though? (although at the same time...you guys clearly know what you are talking about way better than me lol im an enthusiast you guys are pros). Here's my hesitation, and please feel free to blast me and tell me that im an idiot and dont know what im talking about because I probably dont lol I had one really bad experience where my power lines feeding to my Trolling motor plug outlet with the wires on a set screw began to slowly break strands off due to vibration. (ya minkotta once again producing garbage) Eventually enough strands broke that while doing some autocharting with the trolling motor running at max speed caused enough heat and resistance to build up that my wires lit on fire inside the hull. It was a crappy deal because the resistance occurred after the fuse allowing for the small fire to start. The conductivity of a copper screw would be perfect, but the idea of vibration allowing for strands to break/come loose worries me when dealing with such thick multistranded wire?With single strand wire? absolute 0 question that would be the way to go. For the time being I think ive decided to go with a stainless hex bolt with a stainless lock nut. I was actually able to surprisingly find what I was looking for on the canadian tire website. It took a bit of filtering and digging to find one quarter inch by 1/2 inch but it worked. I ordered for curbside pick up and they said my order was ready an hour later. They very clearly put some thought into the system over the summer with the expectation to have to move back to curbside at some point. Sure enough the system was very easy and painless...pulled up, checked in saying that I was parked in spot 21 and my order came out to my door just like going to McDonalds and getting curbside pickup. A far change from the spring where it took 3 days to pick my order and they spent 20 minutes searching a big trailer full of orders for mine. Simple crimped Ring Terminal with a dollop of solder with heat shrink. Then Bolt the two ring terminals together with a lock nut. I am going to try and srink tube it all (i got an assortment for christmas in my stocking  ) then paint the heck out of it with paint on electrical tape. "
