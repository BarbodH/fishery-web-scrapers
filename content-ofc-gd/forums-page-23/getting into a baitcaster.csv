1069271,siwash,2021-01-09 03:18:00,683,"Hey folks, I bought the Abu Black Max at Cabelas.. My first ever BC. I was thinking of what rod to pair it with.  How's the Ugly stik Elite?  How about the Berkley Lightening?  Anything else in that price range? Also, what line would you recommend? Should I go with mono or braid? thanks.."
1069274,GBW,2021-01-09 04:03:00,8460,"Rod depends on are you thowing, chucking, pitching or trolling lures with said reel...  And then there is a budget you should mention..."
1069275,AKRISONER,2021-01-09 04:06:00,5558,Braid if you are learning 100% Crank the brake and learn to cast then slowly adjust it back as you get more comfortable. eventually you’ll love throwing flurocarbon on it
1069276,siwash,2021-01-09 04:14:00,683,thanks guys.. Thought I implied budget when I mentioned the Uglystik. I tend to cast a lot of rapapa-type cranks...the odd spinnerbait... I also enjoy trolling... I probably troll 25% of the time out there.. I am total newbie at BC so didn't think about this.
1069277,AKRISONER,2021-01-09 04:57:00,5558,Baitcasters are great for trolling you can thumb out line easily to adjust how far back your lure is
1069278,siwash,2021-01-09 05:02:00,683,And no line twist either correct?
1069279,AKRISONER,2021-01-09 05:05:00,5558,Correct! Casting with mono or fluro is tough to start. But is definitely better than braid once you’ve learned how. You’ll never go back honestly. I only fish a spinning rod for ned rigs and drop shots
1069280,siwash,2021-01-09 05:09:00,683,"Why is mono/flouro better?  So you'd go 100% flouro? Interesting... and if I'm going with 14lbs mono, would I tie a lure on directly or is a leader required?"
1069282,Garnet,2021-01-09 11:36:00,2056,Adjust reel for every bait in the beginning. As your thumb gets educated this is less important. Yard practice hard so fishing days less frustrating. As stated when you get threw the first part you will never go back.
1069283,siwash,2021-01-09 12:16:00,683,thanks guys! Lots of Youtube Vids out there to helpm too..  So back to one of my original Qs - what rod should i pair with the ABu black max (between $50- $100)?  And what line? Thanks!
1069284,AKRISONER,2021-01-09 13:43:00,5558,Cast any hardbait on good flurocarbon AMS youll be blown away at the distance. If I throw a jerkbait with the wind I can pretty much spool myself with one cast. That’s how far the lure flys.  you can also throw little squarebills and small light crank baits and light plastics etc a ways which is basically impossible on a spinning set up
1069289,GBW,2021-01-09 17:08:00,8460,I'm a Shimano fan so my vote goes there for a rod brand.
1069290,OhioFisherman,2021-01-09 17:27:00,6623,"If I was only going to carry one casting rod it would probably be something like this, https://www.tacklewarehouse.com/Daiwa_Aird_X_Casting_Rods/descpage-DAX.html?from=tbassin "
1069291,LostAnotherOne,2021-01-09 18:11:00,956,"Just FYI when I got my first baitcaster when I was a teenager I practiced casting and flipping in my backyard first just so I could get the hang of it.  I use mono in all my reels, but braid works too."
1069292,siwash,2021-01-09 18:19:00,683,"Thanks guys... Ohiofisherman, you don't prefer the cork handle? I guess not necessary?  What the diff b/w medium and medium/heavy? Fast action? Just got my reel.. so small.."
1069293,siwash,2021-01-09 18:27:00,683,"What y'all think of the Lew's products?  This one is well priced and ""Amazon Choice"" (whatever that's worth..) https://www.amazon.ca/Fishing-Laser-Speed-Casting-LSG170MHFC/dp/B075MY7ZP2/ref=pd_sbs_200_13?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B075MY7ZP2&pd_rd_r=b60dd231-f39c-44db-b956-d2209f2d820c&pd_rd_w=vO3vx&pd_rd_wg=Vr0cM&pf_rd_p=c2360efe-cd48-4541-ac20-e99c48f6c1e6&pf_rd_r=RJSTDE6E245ZKP7K3ZSE&psc=1&refRID=RJSTDE6E245ZKP7K3ZSE"
1069297,OhioFisherman,2021-01-09 19:46:00,6623,"Just a little heavier action, look at the casting weights, cork is OK, no preference to me though. Never bought a rod without seeing and holding it myself, a feel for it being able to do the job? "
1069309,GBW,2021-01-09 22:34:00,8460,I would get a Lew's.  I understand at one point they may have been made in the same factory as Shimano.  (didn't check the link to see what model you checked)
1069310,AKRISONER,2021-01-09 22:58:00,5558,I’ve been impressed with the quality of lews products as a lower price option.
1069314,siwash,2021-01-10 00:37:00,683,One piece or two? Does it matter ?
1069323,AKRISONER,2021-01-10 05:21:00,5558,No...proof is in the fact that the most expensive fly fishing rods you can buy are in pieces. Typically for bass rods 1 piece rods are higher end and there’s an argument to be made about the parabolic action of them. you won’t notice a difference except the two pieces will be easier to transport around and the eyelets will be crooked lol
