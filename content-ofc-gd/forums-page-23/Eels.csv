1068740,Snidley,2020-12-23 16:49:00,620,"I just saw this. A few years ago I watched a show on eels. They do migrate from the ocean into lakes and streams particularly in the Maritimes and northern states. There's a very lucrative industry in catching the small ones, keeping them alive and shipping them to Japan for aquaculture that grows them to maturity. Very similar to how tuna are caught small, penned and grown to maturityÂ  in the Med. The dollar numbers for the guys who caught them inÂ streams and the guys who shipped them to Japan were 6 figures. VERY lucrative. Not sure if this is still going on but with that kind of $$ it might get fished out quickly. Speak of quirky ways to make money fishing it's possible to make a 6 figure income on the Columbia river catching Pikie Minnows and turning them in for a bounty. All you need is an Ugly Stick and a container of worms. Lots of hours too. Finally if you review Christmas dinner for British kings and queens you will always see some Lamprey pie as well as roast Swan on the menu"

Some water supply reservoirs there and the area tackle shops had 10+ plus bass hanging on their walls that had been caught in them, all I could connect with were eels like the one on page one. They cut most of the Golden Shiners I was using for bait in half, like they had been cut with a knife. When I finally hooked one and saw what it was I didn't want it the the boat with me!"

1068754,Snidley,2020-12-23 19:56:00,620,"Well if I can only make $53K USD I'm not doing it, lol. The show I saw promised of $100K and I'm holding them to it."
1069272,siwash,2021-01-09 03:45:00,683,The Seafood depot selling it makes sense.. I'm italian background and that is an Italian owned business. My mom would fry eel every Christmass eve - but only the uncles/aunts/nonnos would eat it! She would buy them live (that's howÂ they sell them at those places).. I remember them squirming around in a bucket when she brought them home...very cool.. that was in the early 80s...
1069288,Fisherman,2021-01-09 16:34:00,7201,"Smoked eel for me, small ones they called fingerlings about 14 inches long."
1068499,Big Cliff,2020-12-16 22:47:00,6899,"When I was a kid (around 1952 or 3 ) we use to fishÂ a little creek in Quebec that ran into the Lake of two mountains. We caught all sorts of things but I do remember us catching some large eels. Quite often people would stop and buy them from us I think the going rate was 5-10 cents for a nice one. I never see or hear of anyone catching them anymore. I would love to get my hands on some to smoke, I had smoked eel in Belgium and absolutly loved it. Anyone know where IÂ  might fish for them in Southern Ontario?"
1068501,Weeds,2020-12-16 23:17:00,782,"I think they are considered endangered/protected now, no? Used to often see them washed up on the beach as a kid, havenâ€™t seen one in years ."

1068504,Big Cliff,2020-12-16 23:39:00,6899,"Dang, never thought about them being endangered, guess I won't be smoking any. Has anyone tried smoking ling, that might work."
1068518,dave524,2020-12-17 11:35:00,4508,"2 years ago my daughter got one on the port Dalhousie Pier, I've got a few years ago but this isÂ bigger than any I got, she let it go and reported it."
1068520,Gil Levesque,2020-12-17 12:16:00,103,Starsky's in Hamilton had smoked eel several yrs. ago! Pricy!!!!! 32.00 lb. They have a store in Missisauga too!
1068521,DanD,2020-12-17 12:19:00,2223,"That was more then likely a saltwater eel. When we use to go to Belgium to visit family, my Ante would make sure she had a good supply of it for my Dad. Here in London there are a number of European fish marks; that all seem to sell ""fresh"" eel. Maybe you can get some from a market and try your hand at smoking some? Dan."
1068522,dave524,2020-12-17 12:23:00,4508,"The ones here are saltwater eels , they migrate back to the Ocean. The lifecycle is quite unique"
1068525,floater,2020-12-17 13:14:00,220,We used to catch the American Eels out in the BellevilleÂ Area. Used to get them every summer most every time we went fishing.Â  We stopped getting themÂ  over 40Â years ago. Over the last four years though I've seen three caught and released in the same area. Looks like they may be coming back but youÂ are still not allowed to keep them.Â  Great eating from what I remember and fun to catch.
1068527,Cosmos,2020-12-17 13:43:00,588,My buddy caught one in Belleville River on walleye opener of 2018. We spent 20 minutes trying to unhook and got it out of the net. Would be nice to have them back.
1068536,John,2020-12-17 15:22:00,2956,"In my teen years we caught them by the dozen in local rivers at night. Sadly, our lack of conservation knowledge back then and the fact that they were, and still are, a popular food source has dwindled their numbers down to endangered level. Their life cycle is very interesting and a good read, it takes more than 10 years for them to reach maturity."
1068545,Weeds,2020-12-17 19:06:00,782,Why not break some new ground? SeaÂ Lampreys are probably fair game. Maybe toss a cormorant or two in the smoker too while your at it. Everything tastes good once itâ€™s smoked!
1068546,misfish,2020-12-17 20:42:00,29133,"Yes they do, and yes,it aint cheap . They have a very good varity of smoked fish there. Hot and cold smoked ."
1068550,ketchenany,2020-12-17 21:46:00,3229,Seacore in Woodbridge sellsÂ them. They are located at Weston Rd and the 407. 
1068551,Fisherman,2020-12-17 22:41:00,7201,"I remember my brother used to buy them at the kensington market eons ago,Â  a sunday treat on pumpernickle.Â  I may have to go make that trip.Â  Best are the fingerling smoked eels in n/w europe."
1068563,grimsbylander,2020-12-18 03:39:00,3016,I had eel last year when on business in Japan. That and lord knows what else ðŸ¥´

1068571,Rizzo,2020-12-18 13:41:00,4754,"Gross. When I was a teen I would ""catch"" all kinds of lampreys in the Humber under the old mill bridge. Never thought about eating one...preferred throwing them at my friends instead."
1068573,AKRISONER,2020-12-18 13:58:00,5558,"Lol out of all of the food available at the grocery store, Iâ€™m not sure how someone looks at one of those things and says to themselves, mmmm delicious"
1068574,Fisherman,2020-12-18 14:09:00,7201,"That what I say about brussel sprouts, cabbage rolls and any peppers."
1068586,MJIG,2020-12-18 15:52:00,227,"Lol out of all of the food available at the grocery store, Iâ€™m not sure how someone looks at one of those things and says to themselves, mmmm delicious For some reason, Iâ€™ve never been able to get my head around brusselÂ Â sprouts either, despite trying for years and years. Â I love cabbage rolls and peppers though. I think brussel sprouts must actually taste different for me than for the people who love them. Maybe itâ€™s a genetic taste-bud thing or something, I donâ€™t know."
1068587,OhioFisherman,2020-12-18 15:54:00,6623,"Evidently the European ones and the American Eels are both thought to spawn in the Sargasso Sea, European countries such as Belgium have also had severe declines in their population. When I was a kid we caught like 5-6 small ones, like 6-7 in ch while netting chubs for bait in a tributary of Lake Erie, roughly 15 - 20 miles upstream from the lake, never saw another one again here."
1068588,AKRISONER,2020-12-18 15:57:00,5558,"sprouts are disgusting unless managed by a good chef. Like a lot of things, if you cook it like an old british person its probably going to taste awful. If you boil and steam crap and dont season it, its going to taste like absolute garbage. I am a huge fan of veggies of all types, but holy cow I will not eat steamed soft carrots etc. Frozen vegetables? Yuck Best way ive ever eatenÂ brussel sprouts, halved baked with olive oil until browned, then placed into baked proscuitto cups with fig and a balsamic glaze drizzled on it...wow"
1068591,wkrp,2020-12-18 16:12:00,656,Which end do you light?
1068612,dave524,2020-12-18 22:45:00,4508,This salad is fantastic and it's got sprouts in itÂ  edit and cabbage kale and broccoli too
