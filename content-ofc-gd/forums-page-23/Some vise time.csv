1068153,misfish,2020-12-06 18:11:00,29133,Thanks fellas Tied with barbells this morning. Like how they look like they are feeding . I tied the barbells on the front instead of the classic way of on the shank  like a clouser .     This bow of hologram will last me a long time . Well there were 2 to a pack for a $1.50 .      
1068172,John,2020-12-06 21:45:00,2956,"I like those Brian, what size are they? "
1068173,misfish,2020-12-06 21:55:00,29133,Thanks John  #6 32755 90 deg jig hook. Dumb bells are 4 mm . I will be trying for shallow white fish with these .  I also think they would work in a deep slow pool for browns .

1068249,misfish,2020-12-09 00:30:00,29133,"I have got to # 20 Bill . If I tie smaller,which I can with my mag light,I would need super mag glasses to tie them on my line. Problem with that would be ,if I look up,the sun will burn my eye balls ,just like we did as kids burning ants .LOL "
