We ran 4 lines, 2 copper rigs and 2 boards with snap weights, all with spoons.  With 8 fish in the first hour we knew it was going to be a good day.  We pulled lines after another triple header cleaned our spread and headed in finishing 31/38 on the day. Average was easily 11-12lbs and the biggest was 18.5.  Speed seemed to matter and needed to be 1.7-1.9 on the gps.  Pretty awesome to be fishing open water in January."
1069054,Rizzo,2021-01-03 14:13:00,4754,awesome! sounds exhausting. All salmon?
1069058,Yellow Fever,2021-01-03 14:29:00,139,"Sorry ...i should have mentioned they were all Lakers, we don't get Salmon here in Kingston"
1069060,BillM,2021-01-03 15:59:00,17367,Did you forget a camera?
1069063,Yellow Fever,2021-01-03 17:37:00,139,"I am uploading videos to my channel now, Jim Lyon Fishing. Should be there soon "
1069149,b_cdot,2021-01-05 13:46:00,270,Nice fish! Nice boat!
1069188,Musky Plug,2021-01-07 14:13:00,398,Great stuff! I was supposed to go with my brother and his buddy on New Yearâ€™s Day. I was in no condition to do anything but they went. Launched at 50 but didnâ€™t do so well. They only went 5/6.
1069212,akaShag,2021-01-07 19:42:00,2073,You need TWO NETS!!!!Â  Or a third guy to be your net man! I would be worried about ice on the launch ramp getting out........ Doug
1069215,Yellow Fever,2021-01-07 21:36:00,139,"I have 2 nets but with the RS net i have you can take a hook out in seconds so no issue, i checked the ramp before i went out, oddly enough i did have to break iceÂ Â coming back one day in November,Â  Jan 1st it was wide open. Water temp was 39"
1069217,akaShag,2021-01-07 22:02:00,2073,"I was thinking that a guy handling both the rod and the net looked pretty tricky, and when you had a double header it looked even trickier.Â  Good thing it is a good-sized boat and for the most part each angler could stay clear of the other.Â  (Even if the second guy really needed that net right now.........)Â  ðŸ˜‰ Doug"
1069234,Yellow Fever,2021-01-08 00:42:00,139,You sir are right ...it was very tricky and really tiring. hate to say it but we pulled lines 35 minutes before we said we were. we had enough
1069421,msp,2021-01-12 21:02:00,1336,Awesome !
