Eyes were going cross after 25 of them. Added colored tails as hot spots. Will find out in the spring,if I can tie them to my line .LOL On to smaller #,s once I get uncrossed. LOL       The last couple of days creations,,,,,,,,,,,, Working on the deer/elk hair fly's and submerges .Need to get the proportion parts down on the hair. I think a big hungry brown will hit them still .   "
1068884,grimsbylander,2020-12-27 21:16:00,3016,RAAAID!!!!  üòÅ¬†Geez you're tying some beautiful bugs Brian. Nice work! 
1068885,aplumma,2020-12-27 21:24:00,6896,"Veery nice job, I don't have the patients to tye one fly much less a batch of them. Art"
1068886,BillM,2020-12-27 22:01:00,17367,Pre-tie them at home under the magnifying glass ¬† I need a few of these for fall whitefish on Gbay.
1068887,Beans,2020-12-27 23:19:00,3339,Geeze Bye...I thought maybe you were having the DTs when I saw the subject... Nice job on the flies... 
1068889,Moosebunk,2020-12-28 03:23:00,3970,"Tying dries is better than¬†nymphs, hairwings, streamers, poppers and salmon flies... well, maybe not those most elaborate and artsy¬†salmon flies but a close second. Nicely done Brian."
1068891,Gil Levesque,2020-12-28 12:14:00,103,"Nice work Brian,.you mentioned proportions. That was a learning curve for me for sure. Especially hackles! Too litlle......wont float! Too big......fly wont sit right on the surface! Check out Reelflies.ca. an ontario fly company ! Thier catalog,has¬† excelent pictures of 2500 their flies! This sure helped me a lot with how they should look! Check it out¬† ! Cheers!"
1068900,misfish,2020-12-28 17:20:00,29133,"Is this site still in business ? They have great prices on hooks,but 80% are sold out . Fly boxes are very reasonable . Shipping is cheap enough for sure . Do you have an online store you like to use ?  Thanks gang.  BillM, GBay still has white fish ? Thought they were almost extincted do to over netting ? Would love to try for some on the fly . I supply flys,you supply blind fold and ride .LOL"
1068905,John,2020-12-28 19:08:00,2956,They are simply awesome Brian! Now the biggest challenge is tying them on to your line! Try a pair of magnified readers or a monocle...lol.
1068915,misfish,2020-12-29 10:11:00,29133,"I had to look this word up John . Just like the monopoly guy. Yup, got to get me one."
1068920,RayK,2020-12-29 14:52:00,25,"Nice Ties! I need to stock up on materials and get tying some¬†‚Äúgo to‚Äù flies. I buy more than I tie, usually from Reelflies. ¬†Yes, they are still in business. Ray"
1068923,OhioFisherman,2020-12-29 18:22:00,6623,"Nice work Brian! I remember using size 12 and 16 hooks to catch minnows, they seemed awful small for anything else."
1068926,misfish,2020-12-29 19:57:00,29133,"I am still a newbie to this fly fishing Paul. John said to go small last spring, #18.l can¬† not believe these fish can see those, but they are on them, like I am on a pizza with anchovies. Thanks Ray I will keep an eye on their restocking ."
1068938,akaShag,2020-12-30 16:28:00,2073,"I used to think that #16 hooks were VERY small for whities and steelhead, but they did catch fish.¬† On 2 lb Berkley Trimax line, that was good stuff. Don't think I could tie them on to my line any more with these old eyes though.............and a number 22???????????Yikes!!! Doug"
