The seats on the 89 bolted to a fiberglass lid on the storage area below. I had to redue the brackets and pivots to make it work. It was well worth it because the 89 seats were 1/2 inch thick and snapped into place. These seats give you a hug as well as plenty of padding from the rouge wave. The driver seat can barely touch the trim on the throttle when tilted forward when it is in neutral. The center pee pad seat is actually more comfortable than you think and flipped down allows easy access to the rear casting deck. Art

Everyday runs are around 3800 RPM at 23-25 MPH on the 19P as I'm not in a rush anymore Borrowed a 19 SS 3 blade prop a few years ago and saw 2-3 extra MPH, thought I might have gotten more going to a 21 everything falls apart for performance, sweet spot for me is 19"

1065755,Musky Plug,2020-09-14 17:16:00,398,I can’t say for certain how long. Id like to say approx 4 or so seconds. How do you determine prop slip?

1065757,grimsbylander,2020-09-14 20:16:00,3016,I think this is a bit inflated. Group 31 deep cycle wet cells runs around 70lbs and group 27's slightly less. I do remember the discontinued Sears Platinum was a beast at about 85lbs. I have 4 batteries in my boat and even at +60lbs each I wish I could go to lithium but $$$$$$$$$$$$.
1065758,grimsbylander,2020-09-14 20:33:00,3016,"What is the recommended WOT rpm for your outboard? You're at 5500 now. For each one change to pitch you can expect a rise or fall in your rpm by around 200 rpm. I'd look at increasing diameter before changing the pitch since your holeshot seems to be fine. 1/4"" diameter change also = 200 rpm "
1065759,Musky Plug,2020-09-14 20:57:00,398, Big money for lithium batts. Was talking about this at work today with the sparky. Max rpms are 5500 as per manufacture specs.
1065760,grimsbylander,2020-09-14 21:42:00,3016,"OK, then you're right there. Any one change to the prop will cause you to either over or under rev. I'm guessing your gear ratio is ~2.25 on that motor so that puts you at a theoretical 39 mph with no slip(not possible). I'd seriously consider trying a brand new 14x17 so you have a solid baseline you can trust. If the results are the same, I'd increase the diameter 1/4"" and see what that does for you. Don't change more than one thing at a time or you'll get lost trying to figure it out.Remember that if you decide to try a 4 blade (increases surface area to reduce slipage), you will need to drop down in pitch by 1-2 inches...start at 1 so 16"".

1065765,grimsbylander,2020-09-14 22:18:00,3016,That is shocking considering a 115 would be under-powered on an 18' boat. The 320 and 325 Comanche boats were rated for 115hp but were under 16' in length. The 18' 350 Comanche was rated for 175hp.

Speaking of Grimsby 30 years ago I came in 2nd the  Peach Festival Men's Bodybuilding Championship. I was the only contestant. OK enough hilarity for one evening. I never met a boater that didn't want another 5 miles an hour.  Including an associate in Florida that has a Pete Fountain offshore racer that was complaining he has only hit 100 MPH a few times.  I have politely declined his offer of  a boat ride a few times now.  I don't want to sleep with or feed the fishes.

1065779,Garnet,2020-09-15 11:35:00,2056,The thing with aluminum props is they flex . And your performance suffers. It's work to get your boat prop correctly and worth every second.
1065781,lew,2020-09-15 12:05:00,12766,I've heard it said that a stainless prop doesn't really improve performance over an aluminum prop until your HP is at least 150 but I have no official info on that.
1065783,grimsbylander,2020-09-15 12:25:00,3016,"The OP is running at close to 75% of what that boat/motor combination ""should"" be doing. Switching to stainless on a 90hp will help a tiny bit but in my opinion it's not worth the cost and it's not the root cause. I'd work on solving the 20% then if he's ambitious enough, worry about the last couple mph."
1065784,grimsbylander,2020-09-15 12:26:00,3016,The picture is becoming clearer now lol!!
1065787,John,2020-09-15 13:02:00,2956,"I guess being an old guy a few MPH doesn't matter to me. On my Princecraft, 17 1/2', 90 4 stroke, with 2 in the boat and little else we were 39 or 40MPH at WOT, about 5700RPM. Hole shot was pretty good. Was told, by Merc techs that stainless would make little difference on a 90 4ST. Although my knowledge is somewhat limited I would empty the boat and see where you are. 600# is a lot of weight in a smaller boat. Try the easy stuff first...🙂"
1065788,Garnet,2020-09-15 13:21:00,2056,It's the fall off I don't like. Load the boat she just lays in the water.
1065789,AKRISONER,2020-09-15 14:20:00,5558,"Theres gotta be a lot of factors involved with this, but ive got a 130 horse that does 55mph...that would be a weird outlier though but ya on a 90horse or smaller i dont see how much flex a prop would be getting to change the speed that much.  Weight is really the important factor...power to weight ratios are everything, especially the smaller the power you have. Big one being mentioned here is batteries. No need for 3 group 31's in a 16 foot boat. I fish tournaments with 2 group 27's and a group 24. Run three graphs, livewells and a trolling motor hard this past weekend for 10 straight hours. Not a single issue."
1065792,Musky Plug,2020-09-15 16:08:00,398,A couple of the places I called also told me this.  Maybe the weight is the issue or perhaps the height the motor is mounted at? That’s what I’m starting to lean towards? I have two group 27 for TM. And 1 group 31 for 3 graphs and everything else.
1065793,grimsbylander,2020-09-15 17:10:00,3016,"Musky Plug, there's a bunch of info on this thread that will just confuse you because it's unrelated to your issue. Verify your tach is correct, verify your prop is good, verify the motor is mounted at a good height for your boat, make sure you're not overloaded (|I don't think you are because you come up on plane well), inspect the hull for any obvious deformities. If all is reasonably good, start tweaking your prop specs. There's a ton of boats like yours out there, ask to meet up with someone to test their prop? Most guys are willing to help! I've borrowed and loaned out my props before."
1065794,DRIFTER_016,2020-09-15 17:19:00,10439,"Do you leave the boat in the water? Store uncovered outside? If you leave the boat in the water and water sits in the boat for any length of time the flotation foam can become saturated with water and add hundreds of pounds of weight to the boat. The only fix for this if it is the problem is to remove the floors and chip out all the wet foam. Either replace with closed cell sprayfoam or jam a ton of pool noodles in there. I know one of the big West coast manufacturers has a known issue with this. On a 20 foot boat water logged foam can add 600-1,000#'s of extra weight."
1065807,Garnet,2020-09-16 11:19:00,2056,Stainless doesn't improve performance as told by someone that doesn't sell stainless props.
1065808,aplumma,2020-09-16 12:27:00,6896,I really like the Ranger 350V it is one of the best riding bass boat I have had. I have quite a bit of weight on my pad of the boat with 3 batteries and the 2 fuel cells on board. The rebuilding of the boat with better seats and accessories did add some weight but it is well worth it. I am content to run at 35 MPH all day long because when you floor it you are burning 9/10th of a gallon a minute. I do like the fact that you can usually get ahead of a storm front if it is not moving to fast. Art
1065696,Musky Plug,2020-09-12 13:28:00,398,"Hey guys, hope everyone is staying safe. Looking for some wisdom on how to get the top speed of my boat up. Currently running a 90hp Evinrude Etec on 1650 Crestliner Fish Hawk. I was out last night with a passenger and only getting 30.5mph trimmed at WOT and getting 5500rpms. I have an aluminum 14x17 prop. I’ve read online that I should be getting closer to 40mph with a boat and motor of this size . Would switching to a different aluminum prop get me closer to the mark or would I need to go stainless to get there? Any help is appreciated."
1065697,aplumma,2020-09-12 13:45:00,6896,Check the boat for deformities on the back edge called a hook. Remove all excess weight that you have stuffed into the boat over the years. Size and change prop to a stainless steel. Out of all of these your biggest gain will be removing all of the extra crap off the boat that you do not use. Realistically you will not gain 10 mph unless you have a major issue slowing down the boat. For example a Ranger boat with 150 HP GTX (racing series motor) stainless cupped prop with little  to no extra weight is doing 58 mph with a stainless and loses only 3 mph with an aluminum prop. The bottom of a bass boat in this series runs on just a pad when on plane with about a 6 x 4 ft area actually touching the water. your boat will have a much larger wetted surface and will have less improvement on changes.  Art
1065698,Terry,2020-09-12 13:51:00,14456,You are not far off max rpm so props will not help too much.  You may get a few mph faster with a ss prop. But I would look for other problems.  Like checking motor heights or something else that causing drag.   Or go on a diet. Lol. I mean the boat lose weight
1065699,dave524,2020-09-12 14:08:00,4508,"Seems slow, how are you measuring speed ? it could be off and you are going faster in reality"
1065701,ecmilley,2020-09-12 14:34:00,2163,Well first you may havr trimmed to high . Motor height may need correction go out and play with trim settings higher isnt always better you want to keep nose slightly up and boat flat as possible for speed
1065704,Musky Plug,2020-09-12 14:51:00,398," LOL. Last night I had myself, a passenger, full tank, 3 batteries, and tackle bags trolling motor and excluding the tackle and trolling motor weight was around 600+LB. 200each per passenger, 100lb for gas 60L, and 60lb per batt. So that more then likely is the problem? The motor is set on the second hole from the top, which I’ve read is the norm for a boat like this? "

1065707,lew,2020-09-12 14:58:00,12766,I used to have the same boat with a 90 HP Merc 4 stroke and would get about 43 mph with just me in the boat and drop to around 39 with a passenger. Motor had an aluminum prop but don't recall the specs. You should for sure get lots more speed with your set-up.
1065708,Musky Plug,2020-09-12 15:01:00,398,"Yes, I agree. From what I’ve read online I should be in or around there."
1065711,ecmilley,2020-09-12 18:55:00,2163,Also.double check gps. Had this issue few weeks ago the gen2 hds was reading 9mph slower than actual.
1065726,Heavy Current,2020-09-13 12:47:00,20,Motor height is crucial as I believe most motors are mounted to low . Ur motor should cavitation in a hard turn at full speed with motor trimmed . That being said a good boat operator knows this and will trim down in a turn . Max rpms also very important .i would go down 1 size in pitch and that will up ur rpms by about 200 .aluminum props can also get wore and just flex to much .. just my 2 cents
1065727,Rustic-Fisher,2020-09-13 13:45:00,826,"Lund Rebel 1650 with a 2017 90 etec , stainless prop , seems to max out anywhere from 37 to 40 at max rpm with various weight scenarios ."

1065730,Garnet,2020-09-13 15:18:00,2056,"It's clear your boat could be prop better. To start put everything in boat you would have, buddy,livewells full,battery's,rod reel tackle. From what you say 30 mph unacceptable. A 4 blade prop and stainless will carry the weight better. Can you borrow a prop or goto Prop Guy in Buckhorn you can try props until you find the right one. You don't really want  top speed. Acceptable hole shot and reasonable speed. Then think about your use Lake O or Simcoe you need grip. So when faced with mountain of water you can go."

1065737,Old Ironmaker,2020-09-13 18:46:00,8243,"We always under estimate weight onboard. An average 12V battery is closer to 100 lbs than 60 lbs.

It isn't very often that water conditions are such that we can go WOT anyway, at least here on Lake Erie. Current will affect boat speed, drastically in some cases especially on The Great Lakes and all rivers. Have you thought about current?
