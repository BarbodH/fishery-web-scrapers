Turns your big buddy heater into a stove for less then $4  Wooster Brush F0001 Acme Deluxe Five Gallon Grid https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B0019ESMLK/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_fabc_tg68FbK0WTJYS?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1  "
1069131,DanD,2021-01-04 23:40:00,2223,Looks good! Great place to dry gloves or maybe burn them up? LOL The grill does look useful for warming things up. Just pulled my big buddy out of storage. When to test light and it wouldn't stay lit? The pilot flame was just a whisper of a flame and couldn't heat the thermal coupler to close the gas valve. Went on-line and found a simple fix for this. A Q tip swab with about half the cotton pulled off (to fit into the pilot nozzle) and some rubbing alcohol.  Stick the wet swab down the nozzle (about an inch and a half) a few times and try lighting it. Worked great one turn of the igniter and a nice torch like blue flame. Dan.
1069134,misfish,2021-01-04 23:53:00,29133,This is mine 
1069135,misfish,2021-01-04 23:56:00,29133,"Do that twice a season Dan . Just a bit of crumb or what ever,will hamper the pilot. Also, hold the button down and blow some air through it ."
1069138,lovetofish,2021-01-05 00:15:00,500,"Thanks guys! I think I will do this to mine, just as maintenance.  Tight lines"
1069164,bobowski,2021-01-06 19:01:00,360,You can also take off and flip the grate that is already on the buddy heater. 
1069170,akaShag,2021-01-06 21:26:00,2073,What will they think of NEXT!!!!😁
1069200,Dutch01,2021-01-07 17:07:00,1431,I would avoid at all costs. High heat on galvanized finish gives off toxic zinc fumes.
1069201,akaShag,2021-01-07 17:20:00,2073,Hmmm.  I see that the product's intended use is with painting............
1069202,Dutch01,2021-01-07 17:22:00,1431,Buy it or make it?
1069206,lovetofish,2021-01-07 18:48:00,500,"Oh wow! Thanks for the heads up, looks like I will be building my own ;) "
1069207,misfish,2021-01-07 19:22:00,29133,Made.
1069208,Dutch01,2021-01-07 19:22:00,1431,Nice!  You should sell them (put me down for one) LOL
1069209,Terry,2021-01-07 19:24:00,14456,"Damn, I hope he doesn’t charge me for the two he made me.  Lol but I don’t think he would have much trouble selling a bunch of them"
1069224,DanD,2021-01-07 23:00:00,2223,"I've got some 3/4 inch expanded metal that I'll try cutting out a grill like the store bought one? Weld a coupled hooks on the one end as to not to fall off and a couple of sections of angel iron to make the heating tray ridged. Thanks for showing me the idea guys. Have welder, can build! LOL Dan."
1069232,Fisherman,2021-01-08 00:15:00,7201,"Yup, have a Brian will make.  Worked very well but unfortunately I cleaned out a bunch of my winter stuff,  my cranky back seems to win every attempt I make at having fun."
1069236,lovetofish,2021-01-08 01:10:00,500,"I’ll just cut a grill to fit, heat it with a torch and bend it over as hooks"
1069240,Hack_Fisherman,2021-01-08 04:13:00,720,"I don’t think there’s enough galv on that Exp metal to bother anyone. probably just as bad to use perf sheet that isn’t degreased 1st great idea, I hope to try this out this season"
1069242,lovetofish,2021-01-08 04:30:00,500,"I wondered if I just heat the crap out of it, wouldn’t it eventually stop putting out poisons fumes?"
1069263,Hack_Fisherman,2021-01-08 21:45:00,720,You could simply burn it off with a propane torch in open air. Or simply do what bobowski did. (Use the black screen)
1069322,SirCranksalot,2021-01-10 03:50:00,3291,"True, but it can be burnt off quite easily---stand well back. I made a wood burning camp stove out of galvanized metal but gave it a good burn before using. I could see the yellow smoke rise. I let it burn well after the fumes stopped. Yeah I know--I dumped a few toxic fumes into the atmosphere. "
1069337,porkpie,2021-01-10 20:51:00,2521,"They work fine.  I have used one for 3 seasons.  I did make one out of a wire grate midway through last winter that is a lot sturdier and moved on to that, but the roller grill works fine, you won’t see any fumes off of it.  I did leave in on the heater for 45 minutes or so in the driveway when I first made it, but I didn’t stick around to watch for off-gassing.  No issues ever since."
