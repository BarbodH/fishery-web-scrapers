Is there anything I should be aware of when using my boat this late in the season besides draining the motor/ boat? Can I keep my lead acid batteries in the boat hooked up to the minnkota charger or should I take them out after every trip? Is there any other precautions I should take or should I scrap the idea?"
1069365,pics,2021-01-11 17:49:00,1268,As long as the batteries are charged they should be fine in the boat.. many of the shrink wrapped boats still have their batteries in them over the winter..

I dont know about your lower end but id also consider making sure you dont have any water in it after your trip? i know some guys their lower end seals leak a lot so their oil is nice and milky come fall...I personally never have any water at all in my gear oil but i still change it every year. I dont run my boat in January but I have run my boats in december and its usually no big deal...just be careful of your hydraulic steering if you do have it. Ive seen it fail when it hits -17 in a brand new boat. Pretty common thing when its that cold."
