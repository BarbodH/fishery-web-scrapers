Looking for any suggestions for winter trout fishing with a 9 year old. i was thinking to try local in the Credit or Bronte as it's relatively safer and closer for public access. I've never been out in the winter and with my son safety is the first priority. Not looking for any private spots, but just general areas with good access. Also appreciate any suggestions for kids waders. Thanks all!"
