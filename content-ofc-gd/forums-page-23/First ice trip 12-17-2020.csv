1068598,misfish,2020-12-18 20:45:00,29133,"DANG YOU ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,  Nice dude."
1068599,Dutch01,2020-12-18 20:58:00,1431,"Thanks....I'm going back tomorrow, if you have a 4x4 with good tires send me a PM brother"
1068600,misfish,2020-12-18 21:00:00,29133,"2x4 here, but thanks for the offer bud .Â  I got crap to get done this weekend."
1068601,Terry,2020-12-18 21:03:00,14456,Nice going  no ice near me
1068602,Dutch01,2020-12-18 21:07:00,1431,None near me either unfortunately (GTA).Â  I would love to live closer to my playground.Â Â Including the logging roads this was over 3.5 hours to the lake.Â  It makes for a helluva long day trip unfortunately.
1068603,Terry,2020-12-18 21:13:00,14456,Yeah but you did findÂ ice and fish so itâ€™s worth it soon it will be frozen a little farther south and I will be hitting a small lake or two
1068608,Rizzo,2020-12-18 22:07:00,4754,would suck if you went that far just to find unsafe ice! glad it worked out
1068611,Dutch01,2020-12-18 22:35:00,1431,You're not kidding! When we got there and saw the open water in the middle our hearts sank. Luckily when we drilled we found decent enough ice to stay and play.
1068614,crappieperchhunter,2020-12-19 00:26:00,2582,Well done Dutch and beauty colours on that fish. Those babies are still on my bucket list through the ice. A buddy and I hit up a Kawartha Lake today and both came home with a feed of panfish. It was an absolutely perfect day to be out on the ice.
1068615,GBW,2020-12-19 00:42:00,8460,Nice going and good luck the rest of the weekend.
1068618,Dutch01,2020-12-19 02:13:00,1431,Sadly good luck was not inÂ the forecast.... I wasÂ loadingÂ my truck to head back up tomorrow and I tripped and that's all she wrote ðŸ˜¡ Bummer!  
1068619,irishfield,2020-12-19 02:56:00,26272,Little bit of Krazy Glue and you're good to go!!
1068620,Dutch01,2020-12-19 03:26:00,1431,"The Doc said two things, ""stitches for sure"" and ""No, you cannot still go four wheeling and ice fishing tomorrow"" ðŸ˜‚"
1068625,misfish,2020-12-19 10:52:00,29133,"That is a hell of a way to get out of ice fishing. LOL Heal up,there will be next weekend ."
1068632,Dutch01,2020-12-19 15:43:00,1431,Honestly I'm pretty crushed. That's such a beautiful spot (I spend time camping there in summer) and based onÂ the long term (snow)Â forecast I don't think I'll make it in there again this year with a truck. I need a sled!
1068634,akaShag,2020-12-19 16:19:00,2073,That's gotta hurt...................
1068635,Fisherman,2020-12-19 17:37:00,7201,"Ah heck, that'll buff right out. ðŸ¤£"
