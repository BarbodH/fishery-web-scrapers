Going across Fish Bay was ok as a few folks I know have been crossing it recently but no one had been any further. Wanting to spend a few days out here to light a fire, relax and watch the world Juniors I loaded up the old bike and an ice chisel to check things out.  	As I entered the opening to Hunters Bay I stopped and walked a few yards and chiseled out a hole. A little over 4”, still good to go. A few yards more and it went to 3 1/2”. Uggh.  	At 3” I just about turned around but treaded carefully a few feet more and got back to 4”.  	This went on for another 500 yards and then progressed to over 6”.  	it took a couple hours to go a mile but I made it safely to achieve the goal.  	It’s very important to check ice thickness every few feet as it can vary greatly due to snow cover and underwater currents, especially around islands and shoals.
