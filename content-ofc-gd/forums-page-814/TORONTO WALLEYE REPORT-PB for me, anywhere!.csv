363429,snag,2009-07-17 19:00:00,1932,"First,  Sorry DouG and Fidel (we've tried the phone/fish thing, I suck) and everybody who has had awesome reports. I meant to reply to your reports awhile back but for reasons below, I could not.  Reasons for OFC absence. 1. No home computer 2. No office computer access 3. Life   I had some time off so I jumped in to share this moment.  I haven't been out fishing as much as I would like!!!!  This is the first Walleye I've caught down here. I had no intention of catching anything. I was trying to even out my farmers tan for a few minutes and was using a telescopic rod that was left in the van. I went to deep water and casted in a worm. I was most alarmed at what transpired next.    I haven't caught an ""eye"" this big anywhere in Ontario.  Now I know how Cliff and Carol feel. sort of. Since CCMT, BLY, the Urban Fisherman and Jon (fishing fury) have caught them nearby. I figured it was only a matter of time.  I'll be contacting Misfish for some weightloss tips  See you later,  S.  PS. I might be a little slow to reply!!   EDIT: Original image was to blurred even for me so I cropped it. Mu tummy still remains"
363434,The Urban Fisherman,2009-07-17 19:08:00,2050,"lol AWESOME DUDE!  Congrats.  Thanks for the shout-out, although I never did repeat my success before moving away from the big smoke.  ...and once you're able to consult with Misfish hook me up - I've put on a solid 25lbs in the last year even if it doesn't look like it.  Nice to hear from you.  Cheers"
363436,douG,2009-07-17 19:24:00,2693,"Grant, I read the title of your post and laughed out loud.  Congratulations!  Try to stay in touch, eh?  Jeeeze."
363441,Rich,2009-07-17 19:40:00,3927,"Nice work man.. and thank you for blurring out everything. Now people will not only never find your spot, but they won't be crowding you for tips when they see you down there. Good strategy!  But really, congrats. That's a beast."
363448,snag,2009-07-17 19:57:00,1932," Yeah, the winter fat has lingered. Good thing I'm married and it doesn't matter how I look!   For reasons we discussed whilst fishing before, I'm swamped! I hope you sang out loud too! Fall's looking better?????   Thanks Rich, I should also consult with you on the weightloss thing.  You nailed it though. I give tips freely but enjoy my privacy these days. (I don't want the OFC wives using my image as a screensaver either)  cheers!"
363451,bigugli,2009-07-17 20:06:00,6138,"The elusive Snag lives!!  Was begiining to think you had been pantywhupped or locked up for life (it happens).  Nice walleye, Certainly miss reading your most entertaining reports."
363458,highdrifter,2009-07-17 20:17:00,2534,"HAHAAH!!  That's funny G.  I only seem to get the calls when you catch something.  ""Oh yeah I was gonna tell you...downtown..YESTERDAY..!!""  ""Dude, you woudln't believe it...I got my first walleye.. YESTERDAY..!!""  You must use a pretty big spatula to be able to spread it on that thick...  That's an awesome fish budday.  Nice Molson muscle too heheheh  HD"
363462,snag,2009-07-17 20:23:00,1932," Thanks Big, BTW I am pantywhupped.   Not fair,  What about the ""in the moment"" calls where I tie-up your inbox with my girlish fish panic?   Hey, Don't be insensitive, I just gave birth to twins a week ago.   "
