Viktor and his friend had contacted me the week before about smallies on Simcoe, so we set the date and headed out.  It was cloudy with 20-25k winds and threatening rain, but the were up for the challenge.  I'm game.  We ran to a smallie spot of mine and immediately started hooking up with perch on jerkbaits... lots of perch.    They kept about 20 of them for the pan, might as well.  Off to a new spot.  We slowed down and started dragging tubes very slowly to get bit and they managed a few nice smallies, but overall a pretty slow day out there.  The ride back was rough to say the least, that wind can buck on that lake man!  Here's one of the smallies back at the dock.    Saturday, I volunteered to do a Junior/Senior mentor tournament with the Barrie Bassmasters club.  I was paired up with 2 members of the Junior Bassmasters Club and I was to show them some tricks and spots and work with them on a tournament format.  We fished Lake Muskoka. I was very impressed with the base knowledge these kids had, and so eager to learn, it made my job easy.  We caught a lot of fish, but could get into the size that we needed, we finished 7th but the kids had a blast and its always great to hear the genuine thank you's at the end!    Sunday I worked until 2pm and then ran another charter on Simcoe for Danny and George.  This is Danny and George's 3rd time with me and a beauty day it turned out to be.  The wind and rain held up for us and we had a great day on the water.  The bite was relatively slow, but the fish are finally starting to move deeper and we managed some good largies!  Gotta love it!    "
