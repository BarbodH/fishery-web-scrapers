364272,doack,2009-07-20 12:21:00,46,"Crazy thing I saw last night drifting for walleye.  Dude behind us hooks into what appears a snag.  15 minutes later, he lands a 50"" muskey, on a drift rig!  Craziest thing I have ever seen out there.  Thing was thick too, really nice wall hanger."
364417,TC1OZ,2009-07-20 20:00:00,987,Should of brought a camera!
364441,NAC,2009-07-20 20:46:00,369," That can happen anytime on the Lower Niagara, but yeah Huron would be more rare.  What did you mean by ""above the bridge""?"
364532,Dara,2009-07-21 00:48:00,3052,Only bridge I know of on Huron is to St Joes island
364648,doack,2009-07-21 11:46:00,46," The Blue Water Bridge between Sarnia and Port Huron, sorry to not inclued.  Also, yes, I wish I would have had the camera, it was a beauty thats for sure.  Never seen that in all the years I have been up there fishing for Walleye.  You are talking 35-40 feet of water, with probably a medium action poll, 10-15 lbs test, and the drift rig on mono, pretty amazing story for that guy for sure."
