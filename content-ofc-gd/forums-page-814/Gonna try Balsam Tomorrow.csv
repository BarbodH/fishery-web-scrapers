364126,musky66,2009-07-20 00:36:00,273,Yep- weed edges are always good. What are you targeting? Just about everything in there can be found near the Park. Lots of good deep weeds as well.
364133,Radnine,2009-07-20 01:13:00,1538,"Find structure and you will find fish (do you have a map? If no, get one) Jim"
364201,Skud,2009-07-20 03:11:00,739,I target 8-12 fow with weeds spread throughout and cast/retrieve 3-4 inch deep diving crankbaits and thread them through the gaps in the weeds. You will catch just about everything the lake has to offer.
364209,tambo,2009-07-20 03:18:00,85,"thanks for the advice guys, i will put it to use tomorrow, and let you know how i do"
364225,Rich,2009-07-20 03:50:00,3927,Good luck!

364405,tambo,2009-07-20 19:28:00,85,"well, my expectations were not high as i am very new to fishing in the summer out of a boat..............i got one perch lol marked a ton of fish, but that was it.....talked to another guy and he said the same thing oh well until next time tamo"
