364506,tambo,2009-07-20 23:36:00,85,"hey guys, theres a leak coming out of the lower unit of my johnson, just noticed it when i got home from fishing today.  there was not a leak prior to today, but the oil is milky.  is this something that has to be done in a shop?  i don't know much about this, but my neighbour does  i was supposed to take the boat up to gogama this week to fish, but i want to get this fixed before.  any suggestions for a place in barrie? thanks mike"
364540,Bernie,2009-07-21 01:12:00,3190,"Tambo, where is it coming from? It could be coming out of the exhaust. If it is it may be somewhat normal. Extended slow speeds with an oil mix too rich or sometimes cheap oil that doesn't burn off properly. The best way to check your lower unit oil is to remove the bottom oil drain plug on the lower unit and see if water runs out or if the oil is creamy looking."
364563,Fisherman,2009-07-21 01:53:00,7201,"Like Bernie said, and, ""I have a flat tire on my car"" okay, lets see, 2 front, 2 rear, 2 left side, 2 right side...get what I mean.  You have to be a ""bit"" more specific when saying there's a leak coming out of the lower unit.  Where's it leaking from? At the joint of the lower leg and lower unit, out of the exhaust at the back of the prop, did you take the prop off and confirm that it's coming from between the prop shaft and seal...give us some help."
364627,tambo,2009-07-21 05:04:00,85,"we're gonna have a closer look tomorrow by taking the prop off..........had to go see the harry potter movie with the wife, it's definitely not coming from the exhaust, i'll let you guys know.  thanks again"
364628,tambo,2009-07-21 05:05:00,85,"bernie, the oil that appears to be leaking is very creamlike, that's why i think we can be certain there's water in there"
364647,BITEME,2009-07-21 11:45:00,1968,Change the prop seal
364649,Cudz,2009-07-21 11:55:00,2652,milky of course is generally not a good sign sign if it is the gear oil.  That means water is getting into the bottom end.  Hoprfully it is nothing major like a small gasket or seal.  Sorry I can't help.
364738,tambo,2009-07-21 17:10:00,85,so we drained the lowr oil and it was clean green.  i don't know where that milky oil drip was coming from
364752,Bernie,2009-07-21 17:59:00,3190, I would bet it is exhaust residue.
364759,Radnine,2009-07-21 18:23:00,1538,Have you tried penicillin? Jim
364775,BITEME,2009-07-21 19:01:00,1968, Great now ive got freaking coffee all over my keyboard HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
364806,Fisherman,2009-07-21 20:19:00,7201,"Last crack at the cat..if the lower oil was ""green"" clean, then maybe a shot of penicillin wouldn't be such a bad idea..pussy lookin oil..yech. More likely, you have  unburnt 2 stroke oil mixing with exhaust moisture causing the milky mix.  Similar when your take off the oil filler cap on a car or truck in the winter that only goes short distances and doesn't get a chance to heat up enough to get rid of crankcase vapour, there will be a foamy creamy oil and moisture mix inside the oil filler cap."
364814,tambo,2009-07-21 21:02:00,85,thanks for the input fellas  can i get this penicillin at sandy cove? do i rub it on my johson?  tambo
