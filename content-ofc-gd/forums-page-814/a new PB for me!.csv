Just before I got this fish I looked at my watch, looked at my father and said ""see ya, it's walleye bite time"".  Not even 30 min after I said that I hooked into this nice one; 25 1/4"" long, 12"" girth and 4 LB 12 OZ.  I missed 4 more as I was using a rather long stick worm so they were holding on to the worm and not hooked.  However it was a good bass fishing weekend with over a doz. landed (all camera shy as they were all in the 1LB range). Now all I need is the wind to work with me in 2 weeks and not be so bad so I can get the kids out in the boat too...  well, no more talk, here is the fish...   "
