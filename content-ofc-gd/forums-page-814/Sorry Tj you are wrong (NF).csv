I know a guy (who shall remain nameless) who is 3 times that age and if he wants to feed his family any fish at all he has to bring his wife Monique, his son Avery and his daughter Jaden out in the boat with him to catch the fish.  Quote (Tj) That's just plain ole slander....

363779,bigugli,2009-07-18 21:59:00,6138,It would only be libel if the statement weren't true. Based on the abundant evidence posted here....
