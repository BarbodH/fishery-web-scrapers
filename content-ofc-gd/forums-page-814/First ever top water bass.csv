364300,NAW,2009-07-20 13:41:00,4022,"I have just inherited a 12' aluminum boat from my Grandpa.  I took it to Little Lake in Barrie to test it for leaks.  Unfortunately it has 3 rivets that are sheared off, so it leaks pretty good.  While we were on the water, I decided to throw a Hula Popper in the shallow water.  I've heard the Largies in Little Lake make for good top water action.  I've never fished top water before.  The second cast, a decent Largie exploded out of the water, just missing my lure, and jumping a good 14"" in the air.   That was friggen cool to see them attack like that!!  About 30 casts later, one hit his mark, and I was able land my first top water Large Mouth.  I have only ever caught one Large Mouth before in my life, and it was only about 6"" long.  So I guess this is a first time, and a personal best for me. "
