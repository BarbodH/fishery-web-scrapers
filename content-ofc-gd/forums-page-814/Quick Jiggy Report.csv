363502,TJQ,2009-07-17 22:14:00,7806,"Well after an uneventful trip in, we got set up and got a bit of fishing in today.  We brought Moniques mom Eva in, and at 80 years old, shes holding her own.  her neighbors couldnt believe she was ""tenting it!!  LOL  heres some quick pic's      Nice bass for Jaden with a hammerhead topwater (plug plug!!)            "

363505,danbouck,2009-07-17 22:19:00,4380,That's a beauty bass! I wish I could say the same about your pike

363528,bigugli,2009-07-17 23:13:00,6138,Looks like you can't afford to have the kids grow up and leave home.   You'd waste away to nuthin
363529,Twocoda,2009-07-17 23:18:00,4130,I can see the pic of your daughter kissing the fish resurfacing someday ......maybe on her wedding
363588,Handlebarz,2009-07-18 03:29:00,3790,Thanks again for sharing that beautiful place with us Boss I sure do miss it how are your new neighbours?
363595,Cudz,2009-07-18 04:00:00,2652,"Wow, you are right.  That is a pike.  At first I thought that TJ was just rigging up a shiner for bait but it is not a shiner at all.  It is a pike.  Are you allowed to use pike as bait up there?  lol "
363656,Leecher,2009-07-18 14:28:00,7832,Great report and pics TJ Congratulations to Jaden for this beauty bass Thanks for sharing Leechman
363660,Moosebunk,2009-07-18 14:55:00,3970,She'll keep going strong to 180 if she keeps breathing that night air under the stars.  Short and sweet TJ.  Nice.
363788,Beans,2009-07-18 22:49:00,3339, I doubt TJ would give Jadon's suitor his blessing if he wasn't a fisherman !!!
364502,TJQ,2009-07-20 23:13:00,7806,"I dont htink he has to worry about ""my"" blessing.. hes gonna have to get hers first!!"
364508,irishfield,2009-07-20 23:39:00,26272,"Nice TJ ! The ""richest"" family on the board.  If and when we get back to the lake.. gonna try to drop in on you and your wonderful piece of paradise !"
364519,Rattletrap2,2009-07-21 00:13:00,1652,"Nice TJ.....but is Camp Jiggy really considered ""tenting""??? LOL More like the palatial retreat!  Anyhow, those northern women are a strong breed! I know, I married one too!"
364528,JohnF,2009-07-21 00:38:00,3494," I was thinking more about him greeting every avid young suitor at the door with a huge blowup and the question  ""Do you really want to share these lips with a fish?""  JF"
