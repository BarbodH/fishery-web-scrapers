That outing lasted about two hours due to the weed growth.  Anyways I waited till around 4 PM the next Day after I had given up on the Football game, Sask vs Mtl.  Im assuming Mtl won.  off to Hackett lake to do some Bait Casting with frozen Minnows.  First I tried around 15 feet amongst some weeds and all I caught were Jack.  It was only after I moved to a sunken Island that dropped off quicly to 23 feet that I caught a Couple of Walleye for dinner.     My Ontario invasive fish posting   Never did use the Spider cast, only trolled maybe an hour with the C4, but switched between the light Mitchell and Shakesphere         If I could find my Fly vest I might try some Fly Fishing for small jack, could be a hoot."
