364360,Roy,2009-07-20 16:47:00,13728,"Thanks guys. What a great community this is. Spending a nice quiet day here slowly packing the Jeep and boat for a trip about 200 miles north of Lac St-Jean. J and I are going up, bringing the bimini and we'll do the ""on Golden Pond"" thing. It's a small lake with small specks. Probably none bigger than 12"" but it'll be a nice relaxing time without electricity or phones. I'll try to get as many pics as I can but they won't be as good as Joey's.  Thank you all again."
