I was wondering if any of you know anything about fishing in the area.  As well, any concerns to be aware of boating out in the waters near the park would be appreciated.  I haven't fished Georgian Bay much so i'm going in blind.  Anyone know of a hydro map of the area?  thanks a bunch"

However, check the regs before venturing out as some areas are sancturies and ensure you check the limits/slots sizes if you plan to keep anything.  What has worked for me in the past in Blindbay is a silver/blue flutter spoon off riggers just above the thermacline (55 ft of water last Aug). Circle the hump off the launch in blind bay. Good luck and post how you did - I plan to be out there the second week of Aug.  Cheers, Remo"
