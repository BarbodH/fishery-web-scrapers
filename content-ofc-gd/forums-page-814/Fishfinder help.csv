364303,rpsmith,2009-07-20 13:59:00,28,Had my fishfinder quit suddenly while fishing (2 year old hummingbird). It's not the battery or fuse.  When I try and power it up it just beeps and nothing shows up.  I have checked wiring and I can't find anything wrong.  Any suggestions??? thanks
364308,Raf,2009-07-20 14:13:00,3495,buy an eagle/lowrance.  sounds like it's a problem of internals.  probably nto worth fixn.
364319,Uncle Buck,2009-07-20 14:47:00,1000,what model fishfinder?  might want to try a hard reset...
364334,rpsmith,2009-07-20 15:39:00,28,Its a 141C. Whats a hard reset? thanks

364342,Uncle Buck,2009-07-20 15:57:00,1000,email humminbird... not sure the proper procedure... but you press a few keys while powering it on... and it resets it...  i've have 3 humminbird sonars and no problems with any of them...
364352,Fish4Eyes,2009-07-20 16:24:00,1022,"  You dont use them, I would hope not"
364355,Uncle Buck,2009-07-20 16:35:00,1000,you're $1000 lowrance doesn't do much for you either...
364359,smally21,2009-07-20 16:41:00,993,"i had a fogging up issue of my umminbirds first season.  ontario repairs are handled thru bay distributors in north bay.  not sure what happens after warranty but the guy there, george i think, did a great repair job and shipped them back to me.  you can also download software upgrades from humminbids site and they might have some troubleshooting advice???"
364364,POLLIWOGG,2009-07-20 17:25:00,835,My transducer has speed and temp so there is around 7 wires in the cable and after years of stowing the sonar after each trip the wires started to break at the connector.
364397,rpsmith,2009-07-20 19:08:00,28,Thanks guys. Spoke to hummingbird and they said it was the head unit. Any one have an extra 141C head unit they want to part with????

364409,rpsmith,2009-07-20 19:33:00,28,Thanks Huey!!  I'll do that..

364436,ecmilley,2009-07-20 20:32:00,2163,"my 141c quit after 6 weeks of use, great little unit for the $$$ but again I am afraid it's the getting what I paid for, next one will be a lowrance hds"
