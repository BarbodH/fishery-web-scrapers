364184,farsider,2009-07-20 02:30:00,456,The Versa is a nice compact car.
364186,charlied,2009-07-20 02:31:00,584,"Hard to tow a boat with that!  How many circus clowns can come out of it at one time?  On the positive side, it must be great on gas!"
364192,SBCregal,2009-07-20 02:52:00,688,i sat in one at the nissan dealership while i was waiting for some parts.  tons of room inside. i just cant get over the looks myself
364221,ohhenrygsr,2009-07-20 03:43:00,947,Haha yea.  I find it funny that this car has been marketed everywhere else but North America for over 10 years.  It's based on the exact same platform as the versa just a diff body.
364256,Gerritt,2009-07-20 11:35:00,6129,Looks like a gremlin... no not the car.... from the movie!
364258,Cudz,2009-07-20 11:40:00,2652,"wow, someone bought one of those.  Let us know how it works."
364273,Greencoachdog,2009-07-20 12:26:00,8163,Looks like a Toaster on wheels!  So ugly it's kinda cute.
364358,TC1OZ,2009-07-20 16:41:00,987,I looked it up once but how does the back open up on one of those things again? Looks crazy!  I was looking into a new car and did check these out...but I ended up with a used minivan!  My cheapness got the best of me!
364378,SlowPoke,2009-07-20 17:57:00,2984,"I never thought of putting wheels on my muskie tackle box... great idea!  I think they're neat, along with the larger Scion and Element."

364382,ecmilley,2009-07-20 18:02:00,2163,"that could possibly be uglier than the face of my exmother in law in the morning after spending the night bar-hopping, but if you like it enjoy"
364384,aplumma,2009-07-20 18:11:00,6896,Don't let them jerk ya around if it says Nissan on it then you got a good car.  Art
364407,solopaddler,2009-07-20 19:31:00,8605,The way I figure it Nissan must have hired the guy who designed the Element for Honda after they fired him.  That said I own a Nissan and love it. It's likely a good reliable choice...
364434,bigreddog,2009-07-20 20:29:00,84,"If you can fit your fishing gear in it, it's perfect."
364606,ohhenrygsr,2009-07-21 03:29:00,947," The rear door opens sideways so you don't hit your head when your getting stuff outta the back.  As for everyone elses comments thanks keep them coming,  It's quite funny to read them all lol"

364620,Dutch,2009-07-21 04:06:00,831,I'm sure it will be good for 500K or more.  damn ugly though.  Remids me of the Honda box car/van a bit.
364623,crankbait,2009-07-21 04:13:00,82,"Doesn't look as though there is any trunk space unless the rear seats are folded down. I'm sure its really practical but in terms of looks, it's not going to win any beauty contest."
364651,tonyle87,2009-07-21 11:58:00,26,[  ] hugs corners [x] has corners
364689,wolfville,2009-07-21 14:50:00,396,Looks like a good car. I sat in one and it has a lot of leg/shoulder room. Should be great if you don't often need to carry a lot of stuff around.
364691,DRIFTER_016,2009-07-21 14:53:00,10439,Looks like a Scion with Nissan badging. Or as Mike said one of them there Honda Excrements.
