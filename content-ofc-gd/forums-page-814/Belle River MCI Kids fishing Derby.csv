I must say that mother nature was on our side this year unlike years past she gave us a great morning with a cool breeze from the lake that made it every enjoyable for everyone.  Thank you to all our sponsors that always help out for these events.  Here are some pics from the day  The line up was very long heading right out of the park first thing 7:30 we got the registration started        Our friends from the MNR came out to help us and talk with everyone also hand out fishing licences to the kids   Mo Musky as always was the big hit for the kids    Fishing went until 10am then we had to tally all the fish that were entered that took some time as there was alot of fish caught by the kids this year but we did get the Door prizes going shortly after 10:30 as planned but alot of people were done and ready shortly after 10.        and around 10:45 we got to the winners here are a couple of them      Thank you to all our members for supporting this event and helping out with out our members we would not be able to do these events and Cody for being Mo Musky.
