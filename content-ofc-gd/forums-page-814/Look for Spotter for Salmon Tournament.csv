363932,spoonman,2009-07-19 14:15:00,103,"ANyone interested in spotting for the TIGHTLINE shootout out of Scarborough Bluffs, on Sat AUG 1st, it is a free day on the water and a chance to watch some great anglers fish for the day. The entire field of boats are really good and it is a fun day. Please let me know VIA a PM if you are interested, as my spotter just backed out.  PM on this forum if you are interested.  Thanks AL"
364030,Jonny,2009-07-19 20:26:00,1380,"What is a ""spotter"" exactly?  Maybe I lead a sheltered life (I don't do tournaments, anyway) but the term isn't familar to me.  Is he keeping an eye on other boats to see if they're catching?"
364033,Terry,2009-07-19 20:37:00,14456,he wipes up the spots of blood from the deck  LOL
364037,Twocoda,2009-07-19 20:52:00,4130,A spotter is on board a boat to verify that a fish was caught within the derby rules and waters as stated in the terms of the derby...he/she is not an excuse to have another two rods out in the water ...( trust me if people can get away with something ...they will try..) sad but true)  Basically he/she is policing the derby entrants which in terms ...to be most effective the spotter shouldnt have any affiliation with the boat he/she is spotting
364039,misfish,2009-07-19 20:58:00,29133,Im in.I see my bro Memart is doing it again aswell.  PM sent
364069,Jonny,2009-07-19 22:00:00,1380, Thanks for the info. Sounds interesting even though you're not fishing yourself. Maybe a good way to get introduced to this kind of thing and see if you like it.   Two lines?
364073,Twocoda,2009-07-19 22:10:00,4130,yeah some areas your allowed two rods per person ....which in turn puts 4 more lures in the water if you run cheaters off your rods...( derby time everyone does )..  .having spotters in a derby is a good thing but also throws another variable into the mix ...especially if your tolerance for rough water is great and your spotters isnt ....could make for an early day of fishing during prime derby time ...
364084,misfish,2009-07-19 22:27:00,29133,"Spotter/scrutineer. Great way to learn. Thats what got me hooked into the bass thing. Yeah it can get boring,depending who you are with,but still a great experince."
