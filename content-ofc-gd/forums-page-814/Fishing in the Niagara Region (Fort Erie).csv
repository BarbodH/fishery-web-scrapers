363949,TC1OZ,2009-07-19 15:14:00,987,Hello All!  As you can see this is my first post! I'm new to the fishing community. Just recently moved to Fort Erie within the last year or so....and I haven't really fished since I was much younger! I was on vacation in Parry Sound and started fishing again and now I really want to find some good spots closer to home! Anyone from the Niagara Region know of some good spots where I don't need a boat?  Thanks!
363951,Hellfish,2009-07-19 15:21:00,308,"Lake ontario shores, lake erie shore and the niagara river would be the best places to start"
363954,TC1OZ,2009-07-19 15:31:00,987,"I am aware of where fish live (also where you would catch a fish) but thanks for the tip!  I'm looking for actual SPOTS...like I know a lot of people fish off the pier in Port Dalhousie, but I'm looking for other spots....hopefully in Fort Erie but really anywhere in the Niagara Region is a start!"
363964,Hellfish,2009-07-19 16:29:00,308,"well then try this, since im a ass apparently and your first post to this board is asking for ACTUAL spots, use your knowledge on where fish live to catch them. I actually was just comming back to say check your pms cause I wrote you out a good little snippet but im a  and deleted it."

364101,charlied,2009-07-19 23:32:00,584,"Relax guys...geez!  I also live in Fort Erie.  The coal docks at the end of Jarvis street can produce bass.  Also try throwing spinner baits at palmwood launch in crystal beach.  I do most my fishing around here out of a kayak, so i don't fish the shorelines to much in the summer.  Also the lower Niagara in the Glen area is good for bass also, fish with tube jigs."
364143,TC1OZ,2009-07-20 01:35:00,987,"Sorry lol...  I guess some people just don't have my sense of humor.  So I apologize if I offended you..you also have to see how I got offended...I ask for some fishing spots in the region and you reply with the 3 bodies of water that surround the region hahaha..  Anyways, thanks a lot Charlie D! I will be checking out all those spots before work this week sometime!"
364187,charlied,2009-07-20 02:34:00,584,No prob.  Some have there underwear/panties too tight some evenings!
364227,Rich,2009-07-20 03:54:00,3927,"You're in a decent area, full of spots to fish. I don't know it very well personally so I can't offer any specific spots.. but I think if I was that close to the Niagara River I probably wouldn't fish too many other spots."
364247,castgame,2009-07-20 06:05:00,161,"i'd head to the niagara glen, find some eddies in the river, and work them with grubs, spinners, crankbaits, or a worm under a bobber. that's all i know about that region! let us know how you make out  "
364281,denisk,2009-07-20 12:45:00,163,Stop in an see me  I have the tackle shop on the Blvd.   Lots of great fishing to be had year round
364325,TC1OZ,2009-07-20 14:57:00,987,"Hey Denis!  I will definitely be stopping by to see you.  Charlie had recommended me to come see you for some new gear, and I will be for sure!"
