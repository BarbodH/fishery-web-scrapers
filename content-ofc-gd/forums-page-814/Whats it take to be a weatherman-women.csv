364481,misfish,2009-07-20 22:40:00,29133,"I,ll bet DanC is wearing his woolies tonight."
363962,misfish,2009-07-19 16:27:00,29133,"I cant believe how far OFF these people have been, calling the weather.Today was to be the best day of the weekend,sun with cloud hi of 22 here. Man it feels like it,s going to snow or something. Middle of July and we have had maybe 3 to 5 days of real summer weather so far. On a positive note,the air conditioner bill is nil.LOL   PLEASE BRING SOME SUMMER TEMPS SOOOOOOOOOOOON."
363966,Terry,2009-07-19 16:32:00,14456,I like it cool it's tough fishing in 32deg temp
363967,Twocoda,2009-07-19 16:33:00,4130,Just like the maritimes.....we are going to have summer on a saturday...hopefully
363969,irishfield,2009-07-19 16:37:00,26272,Come'on Brian... it's the only job that you can be wrong 85% of the time and still keep you job !
363970,Sinker,2009-07-19 16:40:00,8692,"Geeze Brian, I don't even waste my time checking the forcast anymore. I just look out my window.  Don't you have the newfie weather vane? Works great and simple to use. You should pick one up, they're never wrong!!   S."
363971,Twocoda,2009-07-19 16:42:00,4130,better off saying 50 % every day...that way it increases your chances of being right by 35% ( based on the 85 % )   Look mom .....no hands!!!!!!!! CRASH!!!!!!!!!!!!
363972,Billy Bob,2009-07-19 16:45:00,5865,"If anyone ever bumps into one of these guys (weather man) please ask him what's the difference between ""partly cloudy"" and ""partly sunny""........to me it's kind of means the same thing but one day they say it's going to partly sunny and the very next day they show partly cloudy....and if there is a difference which is better."
363975,blarg,2009-07-19 16:51:00,289,"the majority of tv weather people just give you the environment canada forecast, they do very little forecasting on thier own so you can't really blame them.  I will agree though, the super computers and the weather models have been way off this year, those models works best when we are seeing normal average weather conditions, which we haven't.  I think this might be the worse summer i've seen in my lifetime."
363976,tambo,2009-07-19 16:54:00,85,i moved to barrie in june i can't believe how cold it is way up north in central ontario
363981,Guest gbfisher,2009-07-19 17:12:00,0,I blame it all on you for buying a boat. This weather is PERFECT. Wear a sweater Brian.....
363982,Greencoachdog,2009-07-19 17:20:00,8163,It's a beautiful day down here!!!  Partly coudy and 78*F (25*C) with a nice breeze blowing... feels like I have an air conditioner on the roto tiller!!!
364005,Jonny,2009-07-19 18:47:00,1380,"I listen to the Environment Canada marine forecasts for Nipissing, especially for wind speed and direction,  and they've proven to be wrong often enough to be unreliable.  ""UP NORTH"" in Barrie???  It's practically a suburb of Toronto from where we sit!  Yeah, Summer 2009 sucks bigtime so far."
364015,misfish,2009-07-19 19:32:00,29133, Aint it the truth.
364031,Whitespinnerbait,2009-07-19 20:28:00,2038,What does it take to be a Weatherman/Woman ????    Somebody who doesn't take things to Serious .........
364041,crappieperchhunter,2009-07-19 21:00:00,2582,"I kinda like not getting fried out in the sun fishing or doing yard work, and having the house cool in the evening for sleeping without the air conditioner running...I dunno...I would take a summer like this every year."
364043,Twocoda,2009-07-19 21:03:00,4130,  yeah me too as long as the winters were identical to the summer
364046,DRIFTER_016,2009-07-19 21:07:00,10439,We have had a looooooooong winter followed by a cool spring and finally yesterday summer showed up. For at least the next week or so we are going to have a nice summer. Hopefully all this heat will burn off the bugs!!!!!!  
364049,misfish,2009-07-19 21:12:00,29133,"  Were just getting that""partly sunny"" part now."
364058,Greencoachdog,2009-07-19 21:39:00,8163,"  LMAO @ mid 20's being ""Heat""!!!!  I don't even have my air conditioner set that low for the inside of the house!!!"
364068,Jonny,2009-07-19 21:55:00,1380," Heck, I'd take that!  This is what our whole summer has been like... and it's raining now and has been, off and on, all day... and it seems like almost every day for the past 3 weeks... "
364098,DRIFTER_016,2009-07-19 23:17:00,10439,"  Yeah, but it's a dry, hole in the ozone layer, cancer causing heat!!!!"
364165,Cudz,2009-07-20 02:04:00,2652,"I almost became a meteorologist.  I went to a football recruitment weekend to McGill when I was in my final year of high school and I had a great time.  I applied and got into the meteorology program (might have been an environmental science degree, can't remember but the major was meteorology).  It is a moot point as I got early acceptance to Waterloo and never went to McGill.  Kind of glad I didn't go.  I don't know too many people who like meteorologist lately.  All I can say is bring on the global warming Al Gore!"
364392,wallyboss,2009-07-20 18:39:00,1095,"All the scientists that are talking about Global Warming had a convention in Ottawa last week,  they are now talking about the New Ice Age!!!!!"
364464,snag,2009-07-20 21:57:00,1932,I needed to get the air con fixed in my van. Cost $500+++++  I might wait till next year now
364466,Billy Bob,2009-07-20 22:07:00,5865, Maybe you aren't old enough to remember this but in the 70's the same scientists that are now predicting Global Warming were then predicting Global Cooling........ look it up if you don't believe it........  The weather patterns go in cycles just like rabbits and other earthly things.......I never believed in Global Warming and never will..............why the thermal pools and releases in Yellowstone have more impact on the earth than most.......oh there I go........Sorry....  Bob
