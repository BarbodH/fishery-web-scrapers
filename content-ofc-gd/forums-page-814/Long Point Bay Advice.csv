Any advice on what we can expect when we get there ?? Or maybe where to head and what would be the best technique ?  we're fishing for bass... large or small ! haha  Thanks

My advice would be not to go to Longpoint Bay lol I would drive the 30 minutes and go to Lake St. Clair but... if you're going to go to LPB, I would try around Bait Island, maybe on the longpoint side where the big sandbar drops off, I've always had good luck there. Livebait works good(minnows)  but I've also had good success with tubes and gulp minnows. If you're looking for largies, then I would try the in the weeds... there are too many spots to mention in the bay.  Flippin and Pitchin has worked well for me... Good luck out there!"
