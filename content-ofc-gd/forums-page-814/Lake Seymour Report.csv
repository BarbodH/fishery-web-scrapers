I fished Saturday morning, and Saturday evening as well as a little bit Friday evening when we arrived. Caught a couple 1lbr's, 2 that were a pound half and a nice 2lb smallie. The little brother didn't fish this weekend...he was off swimming for the first time this year.  As always, I got a few photo's and another Lake Seymour sunset picture to cap it off!  First fish of the trip, evening largie-   Early morning topwater action(skitter pop) approx 5:15am-   #2 of the morning, decent 2lb smallie-   Another fellow fisherman came to join me in the hunt for fish!  And the last photographed fish of the weekend-   Thanks for reading, maybe I'll nail a big one next weekend!   Tightlines, MTBF"
