364235,Skud,2009-07-20 04:09:00,739,I hunt very little due to lack of time. Archery for deer and some small game now and then.
364266,ricoboxing,2009-07-20 12:12:00,398,"I enjoy waterfowl hunting in the fall. Still kind of a noob when it comes to hunting, but learning on your own makes it more challenging and fun at the same time. But I'm not going to let anything stop me!  Nothing better than watching the sunrise and calling (or trying in my case) ducks in to your spread."
364304,gdelongchamp,2009-07-20 14:00:00,199,"I use to moose hunt with a good friend in Red Lake then he started getting mad because I would leave my gun in the truck and take only my camera and telephoto lens. lol  Early morning sun during a cold snap = great photo opps.  On the other hand, I called out the last moose we shot in the area before he moved to Ottawa. I let him keep the rack."
364305,Jonny,2009-07-20 14:09:00,1380,"It doesn't get more exciting than waterfowling when the action gets going - ducks circling, ducks cupping their wings to land in your pattern, calling, gauging distances and letting 'er rip when the moment is right. I don't think you get that concentrated amount of shooting for anything else. I think it'd ruined my hearing somewhat though! No testament to my wing-shooting but I could sometimes go through better than a box of 25 in a morning. The ducks were skittish and stayed a maximum range, yeah, that's it.  Waterfowling is also one of the most dangerous types of hunting if you're with a partner. You and he have to be VERY aware of zones of fire and always err on the side of caution when swinging the gun."
364307,NAW,2009-07-20 14:13:00,4022,I havn't be hunting as long as I've been fishing.  Only started hunting about 3  years ago.  I love it.  Wish I would have started hunting back when I was a tike.  Got my first dear this past christmas with a cross bow.  Best feeling I've ever felt before.

There is nothing better than watching a good pointer work for grouse or phesants or a retriever bringing back a duck or goose. I also really enjoy hunting ducks over decoys. It's a blast watching them turn into the spread. While I'm not into big game, I still love to chow down on a good feed of caribou or moose or buffalo or.................................................... My fav is phesant though, MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM Phesant!!!!!! LOL Unfortunately there aren't any up in the arctic so grouse the size of phesants will have to do."
364373,Billy Bob,2009-07-20 17:50:00,5865, It used to be too much work after the shot but now half of the guys I hunt with have 4 wheeler in the woods and after I shoot I just call on the radio and one will pick up the deer either before we all get together at lunch or when the sun goes down.

I used to do a lot of goose and ducks but now I don't bother, I like the big game mostly Deer, Moose, Bear and sometimes rabbits and bushchickens can be a great day out with my dog. Most of my hunting is done with a compound bow, but I also use a muzzleloader and 12g. Once deer season starts no fishing for me, time to fill the freezer."

363911,Fishnwire,2009-07-19 12:37:00,983,"I was wondering what percentage of OFNers also hunt.  I would consider you a hunter if you go hunting at least once every fall.  Small game, migrotory water fowl, moose, bear, deer, whatever.  I personally do not hunt.  I'm a little too squemish to deal with certain unpleasant aspects of the harvest, and don't have the ""killer instinct"".  That said, I have no problem with others hunting.  I think its part of people's heritage and would fight to protect other's right to continue to do so...that is NOT what this is about.  It's about personal choice...I assume I'm in the minority, but was just wondering by how much.  Up north here in Sudbury, most people who I`m aquanted with who know I`m into fishing and own a camp, will ask me in the fall when and where I`m going hunting.  When I tell them I don`t hunt, they`re often surprised...it`s like the two normally go together...fishing AND hunting.  I don`t think hunting is as popular down south (hunting for a parking space at the Square 1 doesn`t count) as it is up here, but I could be wrong.  Here`s hoping your weather is better than mine today."

363924,Billy Bob,2009-07-19 13:35:00,5865,Deer camp is one of the most enjoyable outings a man can have. Sharing time hunting and just being in camp with guys you sometimes only see once a year is something that must be experience to enjoy. Although hunting has dwindled over the years in population our camp has not and has even grown in recent years. We average 12 -15 hunters for opening weekend for the last 5 or 6 years making it sometimes difficult to find a bed for the night if you're one of the last hunters to arrive at camp. We did have two of our older hunters pass the last two years and will be dearly missed.  Our camp foreman has always welcomed anyone who wants to hunt but tree huggers are not welcomed.  Last year my nephew at the age of 31 joined our ranks and hunted for the first time taking a buck on the second day.  I hunt so I am.......

363933,Jonny,2009-07-19 14:18:00,1380,"I started hunting with my Dad when I was 10 years old. I shot my first partridge and rabbits (snowshoe hare actually) with a Cooey .22. When I was 15 I got my first single-shot shotgun and embarked on a long run of duck hunting til I was about 35. I used to be crazy about it... and all other kinds of hunting.  I hunted moose for many years, mostly with rifle but later with a compound crossbow to take advantage of the archery seasons. I still hunt deer on the North Shore (Iron Bridge area) for a week every November with a good bunch of guys. And I still love to walk bush and trails with a single-shot Cooey .410 or a single shot Anschutz .22. You can't beat a feed of breaded partridge and pickerel!  I used to own quite a few rifles and shotguns, but I downsized by about half a few years ago. Now I'm ready to part with all my guns except the ones I actually use frequently or at least occasionally for hunting. Ellwood Epps Sporting Goods in Orillia has a good consignment arrangement for guns, and I've considered taking some there, if I get around to it.  Does this site accept classifieds for firearms?"

It's a shame really because i've loved hunting since i was 7 or 8 when i'd go with my dad, especially small game, but id love to bag a whitetail too, i did some caribou hunting up north, but that was more driving and shooting than hunting"

363991,Jonny,2009-07-19 17:59:00,1380," There's lots of Crown Land here around North Bay. The link earlier in the thread is a good one for familarizing yourself, and if you're interested in a couple of topo maps to go with that, PM me.  On Crown Land, there's no such thing as encroaching on someone else, unless they're set up on a deer or moose watch, or they've set up a camping spot. The bush and the trails are open to everyone.  I've seen up Abitibi way where a few hunters think they can set up a campsite to block off an old logging road and then think the road belongs to them, but that's the exception to the rule. I've driven around or through a few of those when the road is a long one which I have hunted before. You get some dirty looks but they know they're in the wrong."
