My friend has a cottage near the Bad River lodge just past Devils Door and the Jamison and we plan on fishing for 3 days.  I have heard the Jamison can be good for walleye and just wondering if there are any good pike or muskie spots. Our plan so far is to fish the outer edges leading into Georgian Bay.  Thanks, Marcus"
