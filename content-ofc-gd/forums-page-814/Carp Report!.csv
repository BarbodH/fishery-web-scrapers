I decided to try the almighty hair rig tonight and it didn't disappoint. I threw my line out and chummed the water, Jacob got a little sidetracked.    After about 20 minutes I get a hit. It put up a decent fight but I knew it would be small    I need to be more prepared next time. The water came up and I wasn't able to pull them up on shore so I had to use the lippers.  After I caught fish #1 I threw the line back in, set the rod down and as soon as I turned around another fish on!    I ended up catching 4 total in about 15 minutes. Best action I've seen for a while. The boys started getting tired so it was time to get home. Now the countdown to Bass!  "
355467,MCTFisher9120,2009-06-25 02:44:00,3761,"Nice job with the carp. Nothing better than confidence in a bait or technique.  Thanks for sharing, MTBF"
355482,hammercarp,2009-06-25 03:28:00,964,"WTG! Good catch. Great looking pictures and that spot looks nice. The hair is effective and when combined with the right bait, you can catch carp until your arms are sore."

364253,vasyl,2009-07-20 10:57:00,7,I like small carp!Help me to find any spots more-less 1-2 hours driving from Toronto please!!!
364339,Victor,2009-07-20 15:49:00,1609," Dan, in no time your spot will be crowded with people.  I went to the spot you posted this morning and caught a 64lb carp. Fought it with an ultra light and 2lb line."
364387,bassjnkie,2009-07-20 18:14:00,1101,"Great report. Looks like you all had a blast. My crowded spot is slowing down, may be I'll try those coordinates."
364547,danbouck,2009-07-21 01:24:00,4380, I think I got the same one but it was so scared of being caught that it just jumped into my net!
