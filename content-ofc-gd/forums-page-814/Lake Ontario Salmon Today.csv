364051,Joey,2009-07-19 21:22:00,9122,"Headed down early to see if the salmon would cooperate.  We got a few, but only after we found the baitfish  Saw a nice mass on the Lowrance and as soon as we went over it, whamo, fish on.  Nice 34 incher.      Forgot to mark the spot on the GPS so we trolled around the general area until we found them again, then marked it.  Sure enough, not long after, I had a real fight on my hands.  This one came in at 37 inches.  I didn't weigh it just in case it was a good entry in the Salmon Derby, which, of course, I neglected to get an entry for again this year  Man was it heavy tho.    We tooled around the general area again going over the baitfish a few more times, but the bite seemed to have turned off.  We decided to head back in after a few hours and Paul pulled up the first cannon ball set up, then the second, then the Dipsy, and just as he went to grab the last line, the Spin Doctor, the rod goes off     Reeled in this nice one to finish off the day.  Another 34 incher.  The blood is a combination of the fish's and Paul's     Got the hook in the finger, ouch.     Took a few shots with the new camera just to test it out of the ducks waiting for the launch to clear.      Decided to stop at JB's to see what was new and when we arrived, he had taken off for a Timmie's (for him and the neighbour store lady who advised us he'd be back in 5 minutes).  So I played with the camera again, trying to get a pic of a plane coming in for a landing overhead.      Our major purchase there was the new folding Musky net.  Nice and easy to stow    Cheers,  Joey"

364054,Twocoda,2009-07-19 21:33:00,4130,Good fish ...good wildlife...good times...  the last salmon in the pics is very stout....but i think the second one is the winner for the day ...im guessing 19 pounds?   Coats and sweaters in July....who would have ever thought ..  Nice shootin

364348,darsky,2009-07-20 16:14:00,586,Joey-just curious what you paid for the net. I bought mine there too but was not entirely satisfied with what I paid for it. Cats Meow for muskie nets tho' .
