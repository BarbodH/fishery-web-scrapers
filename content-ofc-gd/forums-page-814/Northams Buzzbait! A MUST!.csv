We scored Lots in the triangle heads and lilly pads edges!  Here is Stephanie with a 3.4 lbs Largie!    Today was her first day with the buzzbait.  There was no Birds nest with Northams buzzbait. they work MAGIC!    EXTEND THOSE ARMS MORE!!!!!!!!! :twisted:  The buckets were in 2 FOW...  Technique was .  1. fallow the wind  2. fish the pads hard. dont be afraid to cats right in them. sometimes right over them .  3. make the Buzzbait jump the pads. this seem to p/$$ them off! 4. set the hook and enjoi!    heres a 4.5lbs hit and demolished the black buzzbait.    Now with a 4.7 lbs bucket.  this one missed my buzzbait twice but was on a mission. SEEK AND DESTROY! :shock:  he lost!    digital is the way to go! no more guessing! :roll:  :roll:        a bit of extra!  release the beast! and pray they grow to be a 6+!  tommorow lets hope i get a 6+!  vacation = fish everyday!  i have 2 weeks off.
