351472,Musky or Specks,2009-06-12 19:30:00,2710,If someone has posted single point barbless it is unenforcable under the fisheries act but if it is private property you can be charged with trespass for not using a single barbless if thats the terms of fishing that land.
351474,bigreddog,2009-06-12 19:46:00,84," Note that on that particular page, the regulations are dated 2004-5.  Ontario MNR regulations have been updated since then."
351492,mpagnan,2009-06-12 20:37:00,84,Called the Ministry.  1 treble = 1 single.
351503,Guest gbfisher,2009-06-12 21:09:00,0,pays to call.............
351505,BUSTER,2009-06-12 21:23:00,1336,That solves that now doesn't it~
351539,Fisherman,2009-06-12 23:52:00,7201,"Apologies sent to Musky and Specks, but I still feel the way it's written in the exceptions to Zone 16 at that river, leaves a bit open to interpretation."
351554,Musky or Specks,2009-06-13 00:56:00,2710,Only if you dont read the definition of a hook on page 8 of the regs. I have discussed this many times with the policy makers at MNR but they feel that the way it is stated is plain enough. Also with all the new soft baits out there artificial is really being left up to intepretation by the CO's. Those artificial steelhead worms are pretty deadly and can be swallowed just as readily by a trout causing death. Yet they would still be usable under the reg artificial bait only.
351716,Rich,2009-06-13 20:45:00,3927,There are signs up on the upper Grand that also show that trebles aren't allowed.
351769,Musky or Specks,2009-06-14 01:39:00,2710,The signs have always been there and they say single barbless.
363565,mpagnan,2009-07-18 01:47:00,84,Have to make a new comment on this.  While I was reading what the rest of you had to say on this I decided to call the Ministry and they said that a treble = single hook.  It also happens that I also asked the same question to the Ministry via web and I received my reply yesterday.  The reply stated that the treble must go!  What the hell are these guys doing?  So which one of the answers is correct?
364161,Fisherman,2009-07-20 01:58:00,7201,"Pags, I honestly think the problem is that most of the MNR types are aware of the ""treble on an artificial"" counts as ""one"" hook, however, there may be some that are totally unaware of the special exceptions as the one in zone 16 at Whitmans creek where it actually says ""one barbless hook on lures"", should indicate, no trebles allowed.  Anyway, I'm not going fishing there to find out."
364310,Hairpy,2009-07-20 14:25:00,73,"Regardless of what the regs state, you will quickly find out how much easier it is on the fish if you use a single point hook.  Joseph"
351227,mpagnan,2009-06-11 23:27:00,84,"Hello,  I'm heading to Brantford this weekend and was going to scout and fish Whiteman's Creek.  I have a  question about my spinners.  Do I have to replace the trebles to a single?  And if so, how do I do it without snipping the treble off?  Thanks"
351230,BillM,2009-06-11 23:35:00,17367,What do the regs say?  If they say you need a single barbless then you'll need to cut off the treble and use a single siwash in it's place.
351233,Musky or Specks,2009-06-11 23:41:00,2710,Three hooks in a gang(treble) are considered one hook just pinch the barbs. Its right in the regs read them.
351241,Fisherman,2009-06-12 00:03:00,7201,"Well then you had better sign up for comprehension classes, he read it, I read it and it says artificial lures, only ONE SINGLE BARBLESS HOOK.  It's in the exceptions section"
351245,Billy Bob,2009-06-12 00:07:00,5865,
351267,Fisherman,2009-06-12 00:50:00,7201,More popcorn eh..
351275,Danubian,2009-06-12 01:18:00,65," If your spinners have a hook attachment ring, then you can remove the treble and attach one single hook to the ring. However, I found it not quite worth the trouble since hooks usually don't have the eye large enough to allow free movement once attached to the ring, so the hook is somewhat semi-rigid. So many fish hitting the lure I lost -not even hooked- because of the hook not being where it should have been...  Most of the spinners -PantherMartins particularly- don't even have an attachment ring so after a ""trial and error process"", including attaching a ring, in the end I applied a more radical solution to it: snipped off the treble and attached a single hook by running a small jig loop of 12lb mono through the eye of the spinner and the eye of the hook. ( jig knot -> http://www.eangler.com/static/eangler/knots/jigloop.htm ). I thought 12Lb would be strong enough to resist when the lure gets tangled on a branch, a rock or some weeds.  It works pretty well, so now I have a whole ""Upper Credit"" set of spinners."
351299,dave524,2009-06-12 02:24:00,4508,"at one time you could get siwash hooks that the eye was slightly open and once you cut off the treble you just closed the ringed eye on the siwash with pliers, some quick work with a Dremel and it could be barbless."
351350,danc,2009-06-12 08:30:00,4677," This is correct, where I fish. A treble is considered a single hook."
351360,Musky or Specks,2009-06-12 11:23:00,2710,And its the same here. I cant find a link to the regs that works but its in the front section
351361,Raf,2009-06-12 11:28:00,3495,"it's an exception boys.  some areas (ie. upper credit river) explicitly state single (one point), non-barbed hook only.  no trebles (three points).  personally i don't think it's such a bad thing, we've gone to single siwash hooks on all our spring trout lures (body baits, spoons & spinners).  the baits run better in my opinion and it makes release that much easier.  trout and trebles are like velcro i've found.  to the original poster, unless the treble is on a split ring, you can't remove it without cutting the treble.  what dave524 said about the single siwash' is correct, they are still around.  they come with the eye open so you can put it on your lure and squash it.  don't forget to file down the barb."
351363,Musky or Specks,2009-06-12 11:33:00,2710,
351366,Raf,2009-06-12 11:37:00,3495,"re-read those regs musky or specks, specifically around the forks of the credit area of the credit.  single point, non-organic, etc. etc.  ....or you can always take your chances & find out the hard way"
351378,Guest gbfisher,2009-06-12 12:22:00,0,"If it says ""single point"" it's just that. As Raf said. If it says Single hook, then you can use a trebble.   I did find out the hard way one year out on Georgian Bay ice fishing. The year they put the new reg out! Was using a Pimple with a trebble trailer hook. Counts as 6 hooks when you add bait............"
351383,Mike Pike,2009-06-12 12:38:00,1332,I remember a while ago someone posted that Mepps 'Comet' spinners allow you to screw off the treble and add the hook of your choosing to it.  Just another option.
351399,CLofchik,2009-06-12 13:39:00,854,"  Uh, a SINGLE BARBLESS HOOK is a barbless treble.  Since nobody's bothered to actually put the exceptions up:  Looks like barbless trebles are okay."
351411,Fisherman,2009-06-12 14:23:00,7201,"Okay, how about someone that's close to that area call the local MNR office, get an interpretation and the name of the person/CO so that it's in stone.  Then nobody wil find out the hard way."
351413,bigreddog,2009-06-12 14:27:00,84,It is the same for the Upper Credit:   Definition of hook:   Reference:  MNR - License Information and Fishing Regulations
351437,Guest gbfisher,2009-06-12 16:26:00,0,barbless trebble it is ....with no bait....
351448,johnnyb,2009-06-12 17:51:00,3413,"Yeah...but if you are in those special sections on the credit, I'm pretty sure the signs make it clear that a barbless treble is no good.  This could be the motivation I need to go up there tonight before the game starts    If I go up, I'll snap a couple pics of the sign."
351451,CLofchik,2009-06-12 18:04:00,854," Pssssst, he wasn't talking about the Credit was he? And those sections are non-treble because they are private, with access negotiated by Trout Unlimited.  Access is only granted if you follow their rules, not because of provincial regulations."
351453,johnnyb,2009-06-12 18:06:00,3413,"Pssssst, but some of us started to, didn't we? It just got me thinking, is all.  I'm looking for an excuse to go fishing tonight...stop screwing with me!"
351454,dave524,2009-06-12 18:13:00,4508,"Im looking at the Credit River Anglers Association page and they are saying ""Artificial lures with a single pointed barbless hook must be used. No live or organic bait allowed "" near the bottom.  http://www.craa.on.ca/new_regulations.shtml  Possibly, they put up the signs and are being over-zealous in their interpretation of a single hook  EDIT: in another area it is simply single barbless hook, could there be two special regs for different areas?"
351456,Guest gbfisher,2009-06-12 18:20:00,0,lol I stand corrected. Single point is it. No trebbles allowed....
351458,CLofchik,2009-06-12 18:25:00,854, No.
