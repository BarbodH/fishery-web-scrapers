982240,mike rousseau,2016-09-25 15:56:00,4661,Got this reel from my grandpa and I doubt I'll ever use it...  Anyone know much about it               
982242,mike rousseau,2016-09-25 16:02:00,4661,Collectable?
982244,NANUK,2016-09-25 16:47:00,797,"Thats a good reel, also good for bottom bouncing with that flipping switch."
982249,mike rousseau,2016-09-25 19:10:00,4661,I know  I'd use it but I'm a lefty
982262,OhioFisherman,2016-09-26 00:19:00,6623,"http://www.ebay.com/itm/Daiwa-Team-Daiwa-TD1-Hi-Reel-/302082297810?hash=item4655820fd2:g:kLMAAOSwLF1X4vfs  Only saw that one on ebay, just from the style I am guessing a late 80's or early 90's reel? Everyone I knew used Abu or Shimano baitcasters."
982265,mike rousseau,2016-09-26 00:43:00,4661,Looks close  This has been sitting in a crown royal bag probably for 20 years... its like brand new and grandpa didn't have a boat for a really long time
982267,OhioFisherman,2016-09-26 00:58:00,6623,"LOL, got to love crown royal bags! Great for reel storage!"
982409,Duckie,2016-09-28 02:08:00,305,these are great reels. my dad had a similar model but they were all black. I believe they were from 1993 or so and sold back then for $150 US. his had the flippin bar too. they came in two gear ratios from what I can recall. 6.3 and 5.3 I think
