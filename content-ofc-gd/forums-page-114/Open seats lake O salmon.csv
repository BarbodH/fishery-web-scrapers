981672,Freshtrax,2016-09-17 00:47:00,2215,I'm still hoping for another trip  the weekend after this one but will be out in 250-300 hopefully looking for some meat to fill the freezer for winter.
981691,porkpie,2016-09-17 10:54:00,2521,Hopefully the wind cooperates for you! I can only go that far in my boat when the lake is glass and the forecast is perfect!
981929,huzzsaba,2016-09-20 20:01:00,884,"It's all you man, the boat, figuring them out, I was just the idiot cranking on the reel, fun evening for sure, thanks!  That was my story the last time Andrew took me out.  We went 2/2 that day in the short outing! A day I will never forget!"
982022,Joeytier,2016-09-22 03:12:00,3990,I'll bet some fun was had that day.  Good stuff guys.
981444,Freshtrax,2016-09-13 17:39:00,2215,"Have Seats  open for Thursday, afternoon/evening. Boat is In Hamilton will be fishing bronte.    All gear I have you just need a fishing licence.....2 seats available."
981448,Freshtrax,2016-09-13 18:24:00,2215,"Seats filled, report of monster Zalmons to follow."
981485,TheTallPolak,2016-09-14 13:01:00,26,30 Minutes between posts doesn't surprise me aha.  Good luck and looking forward to your report!
981488,leaf4,2016-09-14 13:26:00,2466,I'd have been in in a heartbeat... Haven't done an evening fish just early morning
981503,TheTallPolak,2016-09-14 16:09:00,26,Ive never fished lake Ontario from a boat!
981505,Freshtrax,2016-09-14 16:59:00,2215,"Unless your in the market for 8 new rods n reels and a new boat ....don't....it's highly addictive.  There will be some familiar faces in this report, let's hope the fish cooperate I have been swamped at work and haven't been out in a few weeks."
981508,AKRISONER,2016-09-14 17:15:00,5558,wish i could have taken this offer
981511,Old Ironmaker,2016-09-14 17:35:00,8243,"Just 8 Freshtrax? What about the new riggers, gunnel system, balls, Scottie holders, Leadcore line, a dozen Dipsy's at 15 bucks a piece, $1000.00 of new Salmon specific plugs and spoons, a 100 bucks for the Tackle Mate box to keep them from welding themselves together, bigger screen GPS combo so you don't have to squint to see where you are going, VHF for big water. All that plus many $$'s of little things like rigger clips, teasers, real swivels not CTC Chinese specials that will straighten out like a Bobbie pin with a King on. Forgot the new 36"" net, or bigger for over a 100 Samolians. Ooops forgot the trolling kicker for a few grand.  And I almost forgot, what was I thinking? Once all that is bought and rigged you realize your 19 foot deep V and 115HP is just not big enough. Time to go shopping for a bigger glass boat of 23' minimum.  Now you are all set for longlining on Ontario for big giant Salmies and might as well head to Erie for big giant Walleye. Now we will have to talk about what you will need to spend on Walleye tackle. A few hundred will get you started.  Great on you Freshtrax for the wonderful offer to share your stuff and knowledge. The tall Polish gentlemen better watch what he wishes for.  Welcome to OFC by the way my tall Pole friend. Start a new thread here and introduce yourself to all the folks here. Just a bit about yourself and what you fish for, stuff like that."
981535,Rizzo,2016-09-14 23:11:00,4754,Looking forward to the report. I have Monday off and am debating on Lake O or heading down to St. Clair for muskies. Your report may settle my destination

Some great memories with my grandfather out on Lake Huron/Georgian Bay back in the day. He shared his boat with another guy but they eventually had to give it up because maintenance alone became way too expensive."

I have a small fishing boat and some toys (kayaks, canoes, etc) at my cottage so I am quite familiar with most of the stuff required for general trolling (dipseys, planer boards, rods, reels, nets) in terms of Lake Ontario, I know my boat is not big enough to be ""safe"". I have been fishing all my life but only got into Salmon last year, when I purchased my first center pin.  I do my fair share of Pier fishing and River fishing for Salmon, I haven't caught one from a Pier just yet but I'm working on it and help other people who do end up catching!  I've been on this forum for quite some time, and offered my 2 cents where-ever I have knowledge/experience! That being said I am always learning so anything I say is solely my opinion!  As the expression goes, nothing good is cheap and cheap is never good!"

981600,Freshtrax,2016-09-16 02:01:00,2215,"Chris Brock and Ckewely met me down in the hammer around 4 but it Was nasty out on the big lake,   So we fished the Hamilton harbour .  None of us had done this before and we had low expectations.   The graph was nuts I wish we had a picture, but we couldn't get a bite for the first 40 min.  We  switched some baits up  end ended the day 1/3.  Not bad for 2 hours fishing  Nice evening to be out on the water and a tank 28 lb salmon . This fish had all sorts of tricks up its gills ,  swam past the boat,  played dead, wrapped the rigger cable.  A quick pic and she swam off to do her business.....on that note what business is she doing in Hamilton harbour anyways...dumb salmon.    Pleasure getting out with you guys,  next time hopefully the weatherman cooperates"

981613,Old Ironmaker,2016-09-16 11:08:00,8243,That nice fish was worth the work I bet.  Happy birthday Tall Polock. I have problems typing that word. I was taught it was not a nice thing to call a Polish person. I'll call you tall Pole.
981620,AKRISONER,2016-09-16 12:53:00,5558,you got a dandy zalmon...all worth it! im sure a few laughs were had as well.
981621,Mike Pike,2016-09-16 12:57:00,1332,"Nice job going to plan B and getting rewarded!  Yes, the harbour can be full of 'em at this time.  I see salmon jumping regularly while sitting and carping on Pier 8."

Pet peeves include: - Going to my fishing spot without inviting me, - Catching more fish then me - Catching (a) bigger fish than me  All kidding aside, A nice, well deserved fish! I hear under the lift bridge is a good spot to target Salmon but I have never caught or targeted Salmon from there!"
981651,Rizzo,2016-09-16 18:28:00,4754,was it just too wavy on main lake? How deep is the harbour....are you just flatlining or is it deep enough for dipsey's etc? You r report was just enough to keep me on the fence between St Clair and Lake O!

981654,ckewley,2016-09-16 18:47:00,699,"Found spots as deep as 60ft but think there are a few deeper spots. Ran 2 riggers(30'&50' ish) and a plainer, main lake was quite rough around 4 but flattened out abit around 7, 7pm was closing time for us (ramp closed)"

981671,porkpie,2016-09-17 00:11:00,2521,The last 2 weeks was the time to be on the lake for stagers.  Fishing was great. I spent 4 hours bouncing up and down in big rollers this morning for only one rip. Go to st Clair
