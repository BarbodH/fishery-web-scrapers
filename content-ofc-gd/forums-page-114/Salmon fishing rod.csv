981972,Hedfish,2016-09-21 14:50:00,76,"My old salmon rod broke last week and, trying to find some positive in it, I thought it will be a great opportunity to get something really good this time.  What do you guys think would be a good salmon fishing rod for pier fishing? Length, action, etc. I usually throw spoons, sometimes use roe.  What's your favorite salmon rod? My old one was Shimano Convergence 10', medium fast IIRC. I liked it but I wonder if something else would be better."
981980,BillM,2016-09-21 16:12:00,17367,That's a pretty good bang for the buck pier rod to be honest.
981986,dave524,2016-09-21 17:19:00,4508,"A little outside the box  perhaps, but one of my favourites is an old G. Loomis 10 1/2 foot 10 wt. fly rod blank that I built up as a spinning rod years ago. I built it to replace a Fenwick HMG 1262 steelhead rod that got stolen at Queenston one day. I'd be looking for anything in the 10 1/2 foot range with some backbone to it, maybe something recommended for 8 to 12 lb test line and 1/4 to 5/8 oz lures, of course most might prefer something a little heavier."
981987,FrankTheRabbit,2016-09-21 17:34:00,479,"Could you bring the rod into Shimano and get a replacement? Even if they don't do a warranty rellacement, they'll probably charge you a flat rate fee to get a new one."
981989,blaque,2016-09-21 18:20:00,2419,"You hear it again and again.........but the Convergence rods are great. Ironically i just snapped up 2 9'ers for the upcoming pier season, and they'll get double duty on channel cats in the spring!!  I got my nephew a starter float rig last year with a 12' convergence  rod........and it handles erie steelhead nicely"

981991,Bondar,2016-09-21 18:33:00,817,I had Spiel build me a rainshadow XST1264 10'6 10-17lb it's amazing paired it with a calcutta love that combo
981992,Hedfish,2016-09-21 18:44:00,76,"What do you guys think about action - fast vs. slow - in regards to salmon pier fishing? On one hand, a fast rod should allow for better hooksets. On the other hand, a slow rod should absorb salmon's power better making fighting the fish easier/safer.  What do you think?"
981996,TheTallPolak,2016-09-21 19:09:00,26,"Convergence Rods are on clearance at Sail, I picked up a 10'6 ML for $69.99!"
981999,Hedfish,2016-09-21 19:51:00,76,"Convergence Rods are on clearance at Sail, I picked up a 10'6 ML for $69.99! Yeah, looks like only the store in Kitchener has them, to much driving for me."
982002,TheTallPolak,2016-09-21 20:33:00,26,Ask them to order it in to the store for you    They will bring it to whichever store you request it! (Free of charge!)
982048,esoxansteel,2016-09-22 20:25:00,1307,"I use a Compre baitcaster TC4 blend with the rubberized Tennesee Handle  its 8 ft 6 in and puts the boots to Chinooks and the rubberized handle sticks to your underarm for solid hooksets, no longer made unfortunately, another option is the Shimano model 1804 downrigger rod, its 8 ft 6 in as well and Heavy action, i use it for musky trolling Believers at warp speed and its only about 40 bucks, cheap option but there are many options to choose I like the idea of the 10 wt blanks build mentioned previously, skies the limit and so is your wallet for chuckin"
982049,esoxansteel,2016-09-22 20:25:00,1307,I have also used flippin sticks as well
982052,Tom S,2016-09-22 21:01:00,362,"Just built a 9'6"" rod using an MHX blank for a friend's son. Great blanks, He's a GLoomis guy, but was quite impressed with the finished rod. I know Spiel can get in the MHX blanks, if you want something good it's probably worth investigating."
982054,Tom McCutcheon,2016-09-22 21:20:00,627,"You might want to check out LeBarons. I heard thru the grapevine that after all these years, they were closing up shop. Could be some great deals there for what your looking to replace."
982071,Bernie66,2016-09-23 00:51:00,123,"If you can find one, Raven 11ft specialist is a nice pier rod. 8lb to 15lb line. 1/4 to 1oz lures.  Has enough flex in the top1/3 to handle the shock and lots of backbone to put the boot to a 25lb king. Been using one for many years."
982171,huzzsaba,2016-09-24 15:14:00,884,"Last night I went 2 for 2 on my Shimano Zuraca rod and reel combo.  It is 6.6 rod with about 3 inches missing because It broke off.  Both were king Salmon weighing over 20 lbs.  I have 15 lb braid with 15 lb Maxima Ultragreen Leader.  I know it is not the ideal setup, but I could not believe how well the rod did considering it is just over 6 feet and medium strength rod with a 1 ball bearing reel.  https://www.amazon.com/Shimano-ZUR250066M2S-Zuraca-2500F-Combo/product-reviews/B004BL7APW"
