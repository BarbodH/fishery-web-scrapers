981922,AKRISONER,2016-09-20 17:30:00,5558," Just one unit. How useful is the SI? Ive seen it online but cant determine its usefulness for me.  These are the three im thinking about:  http://www.basspro.com/Lowrance-Hook7-Fishfinder/Chartplotter/product/2258405/  http://www.basspro.com/Garmin-Striker-7-SV-Fishfinder/product/1509231248/  http://www.basspro.com/Humminbird-HELIX-7-DI-GPS-Fishfinder-and-Chartplotter/product/1506251145/  side imagining is cool...but lets get serious, i rarely if ever use it. I will admit yes, i have seen structure like a sunken tree on it before...but most of my fish that i actually see on the sonar are suspended and obvious, otherwise the sonar simply gets used to show me structure, ala...humps or bait.  ALSO  sterling...are you saying that the t box has the ability to plot on navionics utilizing the depthmaps developed using your tbox...can you please explain? this has me pumped...cause as you have it, the majority of my fishing spots arent charted or are incredibly inaccurate."
981935,Sterling,2016-09-20 21:29:00,477," sterling...are you saying that the t box has the ability to plot on navionics utilizing the depthmaps developed using your tbox...can you please explain? this has me pumped...cause as you have it, the majority of my fishing spots arent charted or are incredibly inaccurate.  Yes this feature was a big selling point for me. Plus I already had a tablet so the all-in cost was about $300 (I got all sorts of bells and whistles).  Let's say you have the tablet with navionics installed and you hit a back lake that isn't charted. You can generate bathymetric maps on the spot by zooming around a few times.  I've used this many times to re-define structures that aren't shown on existing navionics maps too.  You can toggle this livechart feature if you don't want to see the modified/new contours.  Long answer short, yes this feature would make bathymetric maps on the spot and/or fix your inaccurate maps.   I can see battery power being an issue with a tablet. I bring my ipad sometimes for a second GPS screen but am constantly putting it to sleep and restarting it to save the batt. Can't keep it running all day.  Yes this is the first problem I noticed with mine. I solved it by de-activating all non-essential features. Only GPS and wifi were left on. I have a USB jack now that charges the battery faster than it's consumed.  Another problem is heat. If you have a black unit, it absorbs a lot of heat on sunny days which can affect performance and/or disable charging (since the battery heats up too much as it charges)."
981681,Tjames09,2016-09-17 03:27:00,664,Ill be in the market for one of these over the winter coming into spring for next year. Wondering any recommendations for what to look for. There is a ton of models at Bass Pro ranging wildly in price.
981683,GBW,2016-09-17 03:34:00,8460,The biggest question back is the price range you are trying to keep it in?
981686,Tjames09,2016-09-17 05:24:00,664,"The biggest question back is the price range you are trying to keep it in?  Of course, I was trying to stay mid range. Somewhere $500-$700. Not looking at anything over $1000 really."
981687,GBW,2016-09-17 06:08:00,8460,"you should get a lot of replies but after being in a few buddies boats I say look at the Lowrance line.  Yeah I just got a ""bird"" but mine isn't a GPS unit and it's for the ice season and was an Ins. thing...  I found looking at the screen on the Lowrance (HDS) vs Helix (bird) in ecmilly's boat I found the HDS easier to read and it was spot on!"
981688,GBW,2016-09-17 06:11:00,8460,I know it's out of the $ range I'm sure based on the budget for what ecmilly has but I said my reply based on products out there that I have used on the higher end.
981692,porkpie,2016-09-17 11:01:00,2521,"I've owned all major brands at some point, and they all have pluses and minuses. If it where my money I'd look at a hummingbird helix or s raymarine dragonfly. You'll get lots of responses though.  Everyone has their favorites."
981694,mike rousseau,2016-09-17 12:29:00,4661,If your not very experienced Humminbird is really user friendly and easy to learn with  If your great with sonar (I'm assuming your not or you wouldn't have asked this question) Lawrance is a good option  I run humminbirds on my boat and love em... I consider myself pretty good with electronics and my Humminbird units do everything I want my electronics to do for me  There are some great deals out there right now on the discontinued Humminbird models now that helix and onix are out
981695,Roe Bag,2016-09-17 14:18:00,246,If your not very experienced Humminbird is really user friendly and easy to learn with  I agree. I have the Helix 7 DI with the Navionics + card. Short learning curve. Excellent results.
981703,Old Ironmaker,2016-09-17 16:12:00,8243,"Hummingbird for your price range, Garmin when you are getting into above 800 bucks a unit for the same screen size. Just be prepared to shell out for a new one after 4 years. I know someone is going to say they have had a 600 buck HB for 6 years etc. My 4 year old HB GPS HD combo is not as sensitive as it was when new but for the fishing I do I will use it until it dies. My colour Garmin lasted 15 years but they are not made to last today and sellers admit that. I have to laugh when my Mom called a few years ago to say their new Microwave went for a crap. "" It was only 15 years old Son!!!"" And I get pissed when some kid at Leons tells me that my 5 year old(to me that's new) big screen TV doesn't owe me a thing it's so old."
981750,Tjames09,2016-09-18 03:57:00,664,any comparison between the helix 7 and elite 7? or hook 7?
981775,BillM,2016-09-18 16:56:00,17367,In that price range you'll get more bang for you buck in the used market.
981779,JoshS,2016-09-18 17:13:00,729,"Unless you're super technical I think all brands will do just fine. Think about what features you want then shop around for a sale or used unit. You can't go wrong with either humminbird or lowrance. If you can make it out to Woodstock, Angling Outfitters and the owner Jocelyn is the best fishfinder resource in ON and will take the time to help answer your questions and setup your unit for you. Plus he usually has some good deals on used units and can ship to you if needed."
981786,adempsey,2016-09-18 19:29:00,1498,"Definitely take a look at the Raymarine Dragonfly series.    If I was in the market, i'd give them some solid consideration.  http://www.raymarine.com/view/?id=11198"
981794,Sterling,2016-09-18 21:04:00,477,"The absolute best value you'll get is with a t-box and tablet with navionics app.  What you need; 1. A samsung or apple tablet with GPS (preferably) $200 2. A t-box $200 3. (optional) accessories like a tablet case, bracket, charger, etc.  For $400 you get a plotter, full bathymetric maps, and most importantly, the ability to generate bathymetric maps for any body of water on the spot, charted or not (fantastic for mapping backwater lakes, or your favorite bay on lake X). If I'm not mistaken, this is a feature only available on Humminbird Onix units, which run $2000.  Interestingly Raymarine came out with a similar unit called the ""wi-fish"". It does the same as the t-box but with CHIRP technology. I'd love to try it out one day."

Tjames, you should call Angling outfitter's and talk to Jocelyn. He'll answer all your fishfinder q's over the phone with no obligation... He's been very helpful for me and I've actually never bought a unit there...but will my next one. They have better prices than BPS (there are much better fishing retailers IMO!), and will price match. But it's the service that makes it worth it and fact they will setup your unit for you - not an easy task for beginner. Support the smaller stores. I barely know the store and have only been in there once, so do not consider this a plug, they've just been super helpful helping me setup my unit properly and answering questions that I feel obliged to say something.  I love sidescan, it's a great tool to find structure. When you're circling around looking for that hump you see on your charts or mapping a weedline, sidescan is a great help. If you can extend the extra cash, go for it. If not, not a big deal, sonar plus GPS is all you need."
