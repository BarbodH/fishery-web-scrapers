(don't mind a small fry every now and then)   any info in that area would be appreciated!  thanks! "
982037,Joeytier,2016-09-22 17:17:00,3990,Do you want a bungalow on the ice or just a cabin with a rental hut?  And do you have sleds?
982122,dobee,2016-09-23 18:48:00,301,"hey, no sleds.  we have done both bungalow and cabin - pretty open to either."
