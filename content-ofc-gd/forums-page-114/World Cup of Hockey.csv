982246,tb4me,2016-09-25 17:35:00,3295,Great game..Had to pvr it as we had tickets to the Brantford Comedy festival...Sid was in full on beast mode..Great game
981252,DRIFTER_016,2016-09-10 16:14:00,10439,If you didn't watch the Canada/US pre-tourney warm up game last night you may want to watch tonight's game.  They were playing for keeps and the game meant nada!!!!
981253,Jds63,2016-09-10 17:12:00,1365,Yeah it was like playoff hockey ... It's going to be a great tournament !!!
981254,DRIFTER_016,2016-09-10 17:46:00,10439,Musky Matt's boy is looking pretty good!!!!    http://www2.tsn.ca/bardown/Story.aspx?Karlsson%2Bgets%2Bhis%2Bankles%2Bobliterated%2Bby%2BHjalmarsson%2Bon%2Ba%2Bbeauty%2Bdeke&id=588877
981265,tb4me,2016-09-10 23:02:00,3295,That was a fantastic game last night.. No Crosby tonight...Not much sense putting him out there for the thrashing coming their way..That Team USA is huge.. Average weight of 210.8 poundsNascar and this game tonight..Gonna put back a few beers I think...lol..
981266,tb4me,2016-09-10 23:03:00,3295,Oh what are all your thoughts on team NA I think they could they could go very deep into this tourney..They are a fast and HIGHLY skilled team
981307,muskymatt,2016-09-11 15:27:00,2608,"Musky Matt's boy is looking pretty good!!!!    http://www2.tsn.ca/bardown/Story.aspx?Karlsson%2Bgets%2Bhis%2Bankles%2Bobliterated%2Bby%2BHjalmarsson%2Bon%2Ba%2Bbeauty%2Bdeke&id=588877 Certainly not one of his better moments lol. Was kind of funny, I bet he was a bit embarrassed about that one. You can be sure he won't get caught like that again. Would be great for Sweden to lose again, that way Karlsson will come back pissed off and hungry for a win. It also appears that we will not be seeing any videos like that of laff players will we. This tournament is kind of like the playoffs for the laffs. Non existent and no players involved."
981310,DRIFTER_016,2016-09-11 15:44:00,10439,. This tournament is kind of like the playoffs for the laffs. Non existent and no players involved.  Wrong again Matthew!!! There are 8 Leafs playing in the tourney!!!  http://mapleleafs.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=892264
981313,muskymatt,2016-09-11 15:49:00,2608,"Oh well, I tried lol Ok. No players for Canada. The rest don't count  And Babcock is still a wing in my mind. His career is now over that he has tainted an otherwise brilliant career by getting that dreaded blue and white disease on his hands. Nice to Milan Michalek playing. Always liked that guy."
981424,netminder,2016-09-13 11:22:00,514,"I wasn't sure about this going in, but after watching a few of the pre-tournament games I'll be probably watching very closely.  Team NA looks like they could skate circles around anyone, but I haven't watched them play a team that wasn't the orphaned Europeans team. Some of those guys look out of place and their defence is very suspect/immobile. I also think that if there's one team that doesn't have their hearts in it it would be the Euro team."
981436,AKRISONER,2016-09-13 13:59:00,5558,im excited to see the team canada vs NA game...i have a feeling that some of these guys are going to get their unwelcoming welcome to the big leagues...
981477,tb4me,2016-09-14 03:50:00,3295,im excited to see the team canada vs NA game...i have a feeling that some of these guys are going to get their unwelcoming welcome to the big leagues... I dont think they face each other unless its in a medal round. I seem to remember hearing that on TSN radio
981489,bow slayer,2016-09-14 13:38:00,1074,"How much does Babcock hate Taylor Hall,Seguin goes down and he replaces him with Ryan O'Rielly...... Simmonds from the flyers would have been my pick,he adds size toughness and just plays hard he would been great against the usa....Hall would of been pick 1b,his speed and talent would of been useful"
981497,AKRISONER,2016-09-14 14:58:00,5558,"they dont need speed and talent, babcock is relying on his team being defensively unbeatable. The scorers will score he doesnt need to worry about that...until this injury there was a toews stamkos seguin line...you dont think they can score?"
981509,bow slayer,2016-09-14 17:24:00,1074,how many did they score on USA in first game?  they have scored 2 goals 5 on 5 in 2 games against the us
981513,AKRISONER,2016-09-14 17:45:00,5558,half of the top 10 scorers in the world play for team canada...would have been 6 but jamie benn is hurt...so ya...
981891,leaf4,2016-09-20 03:01:00,2466,What a game that was! Crazy finish I was jumping and yelling at the TV lol... I felt like this was Todd McLellan from the second period on... Haha!  
981902,AKRISONER,2016-09-20 12:32:00,5558,going to the game tonight! pumpppeedddd!
981953,leaf4,2016-09-21 03:31:00,2466,"A bit of a snoozer, very meticulous on team Canadas part and just grinded out the win after getting the lead, but hey bye bye USA!"
981967,tb4me,2016-09-21 13:37:00,3295,Ha ha ha did you all catch the Kessel Troll on twitter last night..Kessel for the win.. Great game by Canada..
981982,DRIFTER_016,2016-09-21 16:30:00,10439,"Ha ha ha did you all catch the Kessel Troll on twitter last night..Kessel for the win.. Great game by Canada..  Yeah, it was pretty funny."
981983,Old Ironmaker,2016-09-21 17:03:00,8243,I'm going to guess team NA is some Canadians and Mexicans right? How did they decide who plays for the US and who for Canada as well as team NA? It doesn't appear team NA are cast offs or are they?  I know zip about hockey since the Leafs won the Cup. I warmed the bench for shinny games.
981984,leaf4,2016-09-21 17:10:00,2466,"Team NA is Canada and US players that are under 24, huge amount of talent and speed on that team"
982006,leaf4,2016-09-21 21:59:00,2466,"My god that was filthy, Nathan MacKinnon has some smooth silky mitts wooowwww"
982050,muskymatt,2016-09-22 20:34:00,2608,Doesn't look good for the North American team.
982058,leaf4,2016-09-22 22:40:00,2466,"Too bad, would've been neat to see the future best play the current best"
