So I'm looking for a new broker and/or insurer.  Who here gets decent woodstove coverage, and what company do you use? I will funnel my money to realistic companies, not companies that promote the demise of wood heat in (rural) Canada.  "
981283,Raf,2016-09-11 12:23:00,3495,we use halwell mutual we burn about a bushcord but they didn't even ask.  though they did insist on wett certification. they deal with rural/farm properties so i suspect this is why they didnt put up a stink regarding the wood burner.
981285,Steve,2016-09-11 13:06:00,2075,farm mutual companies.  the rest of the insurance companies have the statistics that show insuring homes using wood heat is just asking for losses.

981295,Steve,2016-09-11 14:14:00,2075,"I always have to advise, careful dealing with banks for insurance.  What about Co-operators?  They are a Canadian direct Insurer who act similar to a Farm Mutual, but with more size and better support."
981377,wallyboss,2016-09-12 16:43:00,1095,Any insurer will need a Wett Certificate so you might as well get that first.  I had to get some sheet metal installed around my stove for them to certify it.
981392,chris.brock,2016-09-12 20:18:00,4053, I'm with Meloche Monnex. It's a cottage woodstove though. They never asked how much I burn. I asked a couple brokers if my rates were decent a couple years ago and they said they couldn't even get close to them so I'm happy with Meloche. I've never made a claim though.    Why is that?

First off, I don't have wood heat however I will second Chris's recommendation to call to Meloche Monnex or Primmum (sister companies through TD I believe - but don't quote me)  I have had claims (auto) with both and they have been great.  Definitely check every avenue you can think of, university, college, professional associations, employer, second cousin, etc to try and get a group rate.  Sometimes joining an association like the OFAH for example might cost, what??? $50 a year and through their group insurance you cans save hundreds."

I'd like to know too. I've been with Meloche Monnex for quite a while, before they were owned by TD. I've had a couple of claims on a vehicle and 1 on the house. No probs at that time anyway."
981406,Oggie,2016-09-13 00:49:00,588,I deal with Staebler Insurance out of Waterloo. They're brokers so they can find a carrier that doesn't ask such silly questions.  I've had great service and support from them. Ask for Wendy Robertson.

So what's next, don't insure people that smoke.......how about if they drink or have kids.......where does it end ? ? ?"
981428,Rod Caster,2016-09-13 12:58:00,5784,"Not always true. I'm on my second insurer in two years and never have I had to provide a WETT certificate. All the clearances, materials and legalities are easily searched (if not all in your owners manual) and done by yourself or a professional installer, WETT is a racket, a pseudo-regulatory agency.  Farm mutuals, or cooperators, I'll look at them. Perfect. I run a commercial wood lot operated as a farm so I should be able to qualify for farm insurance. Also, my broker clearly doesn't have the reach of insurers I need"
981429,Rod Caster,2016-09-13 13:00:00,5784," Agreed, I'm part of several groups like that. Definitely another avenue I will follow. Thx"
981540,Paudash,2016-09-15 01:06:00,273,"I had to pull mine out 3 years ago   The stove I had was not wet certified so they said they would cancel my policy if I did not do the upgrade then to add insult to injury they said my rate would  increase $300 a year no matter what type of wood stove I replaced it with.  I ended up replacing it with propane stove, that $300 buys a lot of propane and the install and the price of the gas stove was about the same as the wood stove and chimney upgrade to wet"
981574,jimmer,2016-09-15 20:22:00,2730,You can't admit to burning over 2 bush cords from my experience.  Commonwell Mutual Insurance will insure you (they used to be Farmers).  You have to contact one of their brokers.
981645,Rod Caster,2016-09-16 16:45:00,5784,"I should just build a cheap tar paper shack, have no loan against it and remove insurance. Then I can burn what I want (obviously safely which is not hard to do)  and have no fear of losing my expensive home in the event of a fire.  Of cours I'm kidding.  Thx for all the replies everyone"
981665,wormdunker,2016-09-16 22:42:00,1711,"Hey Chad I'm insured with Cooperators.  Great service & the annual premium is fair.  I did have to get a WETT cerification about 10 yeaqrs ago which cost me $100 at that time.  My stove & installation was approved with out fault.  My premium is $82.00 per month which also includes my boat which has a value of $10,000.00"
981698,Steve,2016-09-17 15:31:00,2075,"thought Cooperators was a good option.  I'm not getting into the banks as insurance companies discussion, as it will be viewed as bias."
