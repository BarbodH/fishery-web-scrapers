This was one from the end of August. Went out for the day with a bunch of friends, there were three boats in our party that day. The highlight for me was fishing in my new to me 16' boat with Jack and his Grandpa(Gramps), 2 of Jack's friends and their dad and a young woman we shared our home with briefly this summer. 3 kids and 4 adults in my small but efficient craft was hilarious, made even more interesting because the bite was ON!  My boy put on a walleye clinic that day, very proud of him as always.    "

Thanks JT...that trip the week before school is becoming a bit of a tradition, more people get involved every year....might have to find a bigger beach next year to accommodate us all."
