Not fancy on the Aurora roll they sell. There was a brand from Italy that Fortino carried, was amazing but they had quality control problems and not sold anymore.  may have to learn to make it from scratch!"
981780,misfish,2016-09-18 17:36:00,29133,"Well fishing was the start of the morning. Didnt count on much, due to the rain fall we had up here. Double double anyone? A few hours spent chucking and drifting, then it was time to get home and get some chores done.  These chores I dont mind doing.  Roasting peppers and some garlic, while working on my little gals turtle shell for halloween.  I was asked to make a turtle shell by my grandaughter. Female nija turtle. Ok, I can do this. Work in progress    So with that out of the way for now, it was time to get busy with the roasted peppers. Taking advice from the ones that know, I got busy.  Looks like christmas.    Then it happened,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, Ran out of propane. (Im going to make a tray for the BBQ so I use  charcoal the next time.)  So covered in tin foil and made a run to the local CTC. Back with a full tank and the roasting was back on.    Getting it done.    Cooling off then pull the stems like I was told.    Packed with garlic gloves, and  vacumed with a straw, and ready for the freezer.    How did I do byes?       "
981782,ketchenany,2016-09-18 18:03:00,3229,"You did well! I nevr use garlic in the freezing option. But instead of a straw, Me being me and don't have agood saverand have a one of those battery vacums, rig it upe witha small plastic hose and turn her on, pull out and seal! It may work lol  I bought a bushel for $ 25 for roasting but no freezing this year, jarred and sealed. Old ironmaker knows the""""bagnio Marino"" situation.  I bought and extra few and made  3 jars in vinegar! They are sealing/cooling now!  BTW I got up at 6 and hoped the man has fog lamps as you guys call it, a real pee Souper!"

Ketch, I think the best way is to jar them after cleaning them and pressing the oil out then a few whole cloves of garlic and a leaf or 2 of fresh Basil fill with veggie oil and then boil them to seal the disinfected jars. They would always tasted best like our Mom and Nani did.  I put them in freezer bags and fill with water and seal and freeze. After thawing take them out and towel dry them well. In a colander a clean dish towel or cheese cloth lines it. The dried as possible peppers go into the scula pasta (water go spaghetti stop) and another towel on top. OK this gets silly now, the colander goes into a large bowl and a brick or 2 goes on top of the top towel in the fridge over night to weigh down the peppers. Much water and oil will be in the bottom of the bowl the colander sits in the next AM. The oil is bitter usually. I will let the oil guys make oil.  The peppers now go into a jar with canola oil, a few peeled garlic cloves and a few sprigs of fresh basil. The peppers will last many weeks as long as you keep filling the jar with oil when the peppers are taken out so they don't come into contact with the air. No olive oil, Canola oil. A bushel of properly done pepes only fills a part of a colander, that's it, low yield.  Kind of gong backwards here, after they are blackened they need to cool down so the skin lifts off the meat to clean them. They go into brown paper bags and they steam actually finishing the cooking process. I cheat, I put down layers of newspaper on the table and as they come hot off the grill I lay them out on the paper and cover them with more paper. A few pages not just one to insulate them. Once they are all cool to the touch, peel them, core them and take the seeds out under the tap.  Now that you have done 1/2 dozen bushels and drank a few gallons of red wine and a crock of Vecchio Romano call everyone and give them all away. I know I complain but I like sharing my pepe. I can still get them for 15 bucks a box, same as bushel from a Brantford wholesaler we know.  My eyes aren't great this week, did you not peel them, core them and deseed them? Those peppers need to be blackened 100%.  Me thinks you guys better stick to Cod tongue pie. Bring over a bushel and we will do them together."

I have neighbour who pours HOT water on tomatoes to peel them and burns his fingers! We put them  in hot water to soften the skins and then  cold water and then peel them, no pain at all.  Preference is YOUR method only and  the system you prefer as Lon as it works for YOU?  Brian has a toonie. BILLM likes walking/boat. Lew gave it up. We are different but also the same.

That's the German way of dealing with large amounts of peppers. My Dad, of Hungarian descent, would string his peppers, through the stems and hang them in his garage for weeks. Once dried, he would remove the stems, seeds etc, then grind them into a powder and we would have Paprika for the year! HH"
