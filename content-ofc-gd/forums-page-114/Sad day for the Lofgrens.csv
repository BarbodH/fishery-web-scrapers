Thankfully he did not suffer long.  Harry B Lofgren was the eldest member of our extended family. He was a lifer with the RCN, a scoutmaster, loving husband and father, mentor and role model. I cannot begin to describe just how much this ""Lofty"" tower of a man meant to me. I do know that he even left a very big lasting impression on my own 2 children. Uncle Harry loved the outdoors and loved fishing. He would not let disability deter him from fishing, even if it meant crawling on hands and knees to get in and out of the boat. He would never pass on an opportunity to drop a line.  Tonight it'll be ""up spirits""  alone. Pussers and lime as I toast his final ""crossing the line""  "
