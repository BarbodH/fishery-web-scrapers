982172,Dutch01,2016-09-24 15:34:00,1431,"It happens every year. I know it's early yet for my  favorite shore spot. It's probably two or three weeks away from catching fire. Every year I resolve to wait until October. And then I feel it.  It reminds me of quitting smoking, which I did two weeks ago now. I think ""I'm fine, I can do this"". And then I feel it.  ""I can catch up on stuff around the house"". I tell myself.  Today I thought ""It's going to be cold tonight, the fish will be off"". And that might be true. But still I feel it.  The pull took me up there last weekend and I was rewarded with a chunky largemouth and a 21"" walleye. Not bad for being two weeks early. I can't post pics because they'll identify my spot and then you'll feel the pull too. If you don't already.  I always call my buddies and round up the gang. On Monday.  ""Are you fishing this weekend?"".  ""Dude, it's Monday!"". Sometimes I wonder if they feel the pull like I do.  It's a rare day when no one comes out so I don't get out alone very often. Perhaps because of that it feels like a rare treat when I do. I didn't call anyone this week. I decided to go alone. I'd have the cold and the coyotes all to myself.  And then my phone rings this morning. ""Hey, are you going tonight?"".  A smile creeps across my face. Yup, they feel it too.         Thanks for reading my ramblings.  Dutch"

982308,manitoubass2,2016-09-26 15:43:00,11391,"I know that feeling too well Dutch!  I consider myself very lucky to have 2 wicked shore spots in my backyard.  Because sometimes that ""pull"" comes when im very busy, and because of these spots, I can still get out for an hour or two.  Heck sometimes ill go all day, or 4 times a day.  This time of year is amazing!"
