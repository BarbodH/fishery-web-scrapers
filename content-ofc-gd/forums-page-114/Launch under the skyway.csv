981769,Rizzo,2016-09-18 16:27:00,4754,Had some buddies try to launch there Saturday and they said it was closed. Is that normal that they shut down for the season? Or maybe did they simply arrive too early? They ended up leaving and heading to Bronte to launch instead.
981798,AmblinRamblin3,2016-09-18 22:04:00,11,I thought that ramp for closed for several seasons because of the construction on bridge

981812,Roe Bag,2016-09-19 00:18:00,246,Forced to use it after they tore out the ramp at Spencer's Park. Didn't last. They don't cater to early birds. Seems they only open when they're good and ready. More often than not there was a line up waiting for the gate to open. Especially weekdays.
981822,Freshtrax,2016-09-19 04:54:00,2215,Yep September hours.. reason there's a line up is because it's a great ramp. And Russ is a good dude once ya get to know him.

Springtime for shoreline fish. We were spoiled. At Spencer's we and when I say we, many of us could launch and be on the water for day break. Free and unrestricted access. After it closed we were thoroughly disappointed. Having to wait for someone to show up and unlock a gate just wasn't our way. I like the concept of filling ticket. Making payment and coming and going as one pleases. Been a good many years since I used that ramp.  Perhaps things have gotten better."

I've since relocated. Erie is my playground now."
