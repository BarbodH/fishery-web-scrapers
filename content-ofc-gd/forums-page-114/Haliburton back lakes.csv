981635,Sinker,2016-09-16 14:40:00,8692,"Best way is to look at a map, get in car, drive to spots and try them. I have found hundreds of lakes this way, and no, I'm not telling you where they are. Sorry.  I will tell you that some of the biggest bass I have ever caught came from small lakes right on the side of the road that have no cottages or boat launches. If a little swamp looks like it might have fish, try it, you might be surprised.  S."
