982284,fishing n autograph,2016-09-26 12:57:00,2540,What a bad week for sports. A living legend passed away and a dominant not even in the prime of his career young kid dies in a tragic accident.

He made it cool to golf when it was a game for the privileged only.  Him and the Bear,Travino,Fuzzy, great names of the sport. All have done thier part. These are the guys that got me into the game. Well my parents did, but I followed them. Lee Travino and that 7 iron on the fringe. That thing is so accurate. When I seen him use it, it was  always my go to."

One thing I didn't know was he was a key factor in the Golf Channel.  The ""King"" will be missed for sure but never forgotten."
