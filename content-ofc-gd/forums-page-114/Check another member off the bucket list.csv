He gets more then I do.LOL  This morning I was passing through woodyville at 6:30 am, way to early for a stop and chat. So on my way back, I had the chance to meet and chat with the one and only Ketchenany. He certianly was not the italian mofia dude I had invisioned. No limo, body gaurds. Oh wait, not all old guys are mofia.     A class act fella which I hope to share a fish with this winter. Made the offer, so it,s only up to him to come on up.  I thank you sir for the great treats you gave. Very generous of you. I will have to repay by bringing you down some trout or salmon fillets.  I got my peppers, green and red. Also some jumbo garlic to put in with them . By the time I got home, I had to get the smoked turkey soup on the go. Only have so much room to do things in my small place.LOL BUSY BUSY BUSY. I also did up a pork belly to make some bacon again. That may change after the 7th day cure. Might roll and wrap in cheese cloth and make a salami.  Panchetta (sp?)  I got the bread, cheese,sundried tomatoes and fresh olives to accompany that piece of homemade goodness. Will have a plate sunday while Im roasting the peppers.  Again, it was an honor and a pleasure to finally meet you Albert.  CHEERS  B"

As for looking like an Italian  dude, I like to blend in lol do I have story about that one! and don't like those black cars and all of my friends are of Canadian origin! Except family! I added another to my list this morning  Yes I will want to get out on the ice, My  handmade 'sticks' we shock you!"

Salumetti is anything in a casing and cured. From sausages to Salami of any type. Pancetta (no letter H in the Italian language close though) isn't a salumetti. It's rolled uncured pork belly.
