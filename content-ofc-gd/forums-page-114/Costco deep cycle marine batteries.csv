981719,JoshS,2016-09-17 21:52:00,729,"I'm in the market for some new deep cycles and trying to locate them at a Costco. My old Kirkland served me well. According to the staff I spoke with, they are ""pending deletion"", which they said means they will be discounted. No stores seem to have any on the floor that I've called, although a few are showing them in stock in the system which I've been told is an inventory error.  I know a lot of you guys use these batteries... Has anyone bought a costco deep cycle recently and/or seen them at any GTA locations?  Great battery for the price, hope they don't actually discontinue them.   "
981723,John Bacon,2016-09-17 22:39:00,3277,"They don't usually have them at this time of the year.  They get some in during the spring; one those are sold they get any more until the next spring.  If you need a battery for this year, then I think that you will have to buy somewhere else.  Walmart may have some."
981724,landry,2016-09-17 23:31:00,1005,Call this place in Hamilton. Crazy good deals on batteries. I bought two gel deep cycles with missing handles for half of what they cost everywhere else. 1 (905) 549-4454

981773,JoshS,2016-09-18 16:49:00,729,"Thanks, I'll give the place in Hamilton a call tomorrow.  No deep cycles at any Costco's in the GTA according to the stores I called."
981970,Hedfish,2016-09-21 14:38:00,76,"I bought one from them in April or so. According to the CS lady, they don't really have them in store anymore and she recommended ordering online. So I did and got it within a week or so.  Just use their web site."

I also have 2 grp 29 DC batteries from Walmart that are awesome.  I use then on a 24 volt terrova and they will last for days if you're careful.  Walmart has 2 options, the everstart and the everstart Maxx.  The Maxx is about $20 more but much better reserve capacity and better warranty."
