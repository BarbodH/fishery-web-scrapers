982152,Big Cliff,2016-09-24 11:15:00,6899,"I have been trying to find a fan, the one I am looking for sits on top of a stove and uses no external power source it is driven by the heat from the stove. I have tried searching for them on Google but there must be another name for them because I haven't had any luck. Have any of you used one of them and where can I find one?"
982153,dave524,2016-09-24 11:21:00,4508,"TSC advertises them Cliff  You're in luck, 30 bucks off the original 100 cfm Eco Fan in this weeks flyer, $69.99 on sale."
982154,Raf,2016-09-24 11:21:00,3495,Cliff do you mean a wood stove fan like this  https://www.homehardware.ca/en/rec/index.htm/Heating-Ventilation-Cooling-Home-Comfort/Heating/Stove-Fireplace-Supp/Blowers-Fans/Ecofan-Ultrair-Nickel-Wood-Stove-Fan/_/N-ntim8/R-I5530047?Num=0  just google wood stove fan.
982156,Big Cliff,2016-09-24 11:32:00,6899,Thanks guys had no idea what they were called. Lots of options now Lol! Heading for TSC this morning
982157,Raf,2016-09-24 11:40:00,3495,i don't know how well they work  i find blowing cold air AT our wood stove works really well and letting convection take care of the work.  we have a backsplit and the wood stove is in the basement - i have small fans at the top of each staircase along the floor pointing down (pushing cold air down) if I stick my hand up to the top i can feel the warm air returning.  the basement is obviously warmer but this method does a good job circulating the warm air.
982159,Beans,2016-09-24 12:19:00,3339,Our over head fan seems to circulate the heat well in our living room when we use the wood stove (emergency and recreational only due to MB's asthma)

982203,porkpie,2016-09-24 23:22:00,2521,They work pretty well Cliff.  We've used one on top of the wood stove at the hunt camp for the last 4 winters.

982215,Freshtrax,2016-09-25 01:18:00,2215,Home hardware has them also... They work good we had one at the lakehous growing up and def. helped in the winter.

982225,Big Cliff,2016-09-25 08:56:00,6899,Thanks guys. Reason I wanted one of these is if there is a power failure it will still blow warm air (no hydro needed). I'm actually going to put it on a free standing propane stove but expect it will work just as well as on a wood stove. I'll let you know how it goes.
982243,farsider,2016-09-25 16:17:00,456,"Cdn. Tire also carries them.  I think they are CDN made in Wiarton, ON (?)  Uncle has used one on his Stoves for years.  Loves 'em.  Cheers, Mark"
