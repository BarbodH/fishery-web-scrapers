981667,Old Ironmaker,2016-09-16 23:11:00,8243,I still love the smell of Shepherd peppers roasting on the charcoal grill. As a kid we helped do a dozen or more bushels over 2 days. Now I cheat using gas and freezing them rather than jar them in oil and Basil. Less and less every year now. Down to 1/2 a bushel. Most were given away but only after I did them all.  The smell of roasting red peppers is my favorite smell cooking bar none. My least favorite cooking thing is cleaning roasted red peppers  I'm sorry I was intending on PM'ing you that. My blood sugar has been low all day and can't keep the numbrs up.

Seems a short trip for a fish in the AM, then home to get the peppers done. I will be using the ole propane grill to get it done. What ever works right."
981720,JoshS,2016-09-17 22:00:00,729,Nice work! Toon salmon looks like a good time. You gonna add a Lake O 25lber to the list next? That'll be quite the ride!

Ya the salmon is checked off, but a bigg,n would clinch it.I realy want a good one on.  Im sure I,ll hook into one the next couple of weeks."
981579,misfish,2016-09-15 22:46:00,29133,"Was to be a weekend of 4 lakes in 4 days, but the season of salmon upon us and steel head to follow, I wanted to try something different.  Call it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,  Taking advantage with the toon,  Advantage= getting away, out from the wading crowd on the rivers edge. Out where they cant get.  Well today was the day to figure out, where to be. I wasnt expecting much as the run has been behind. It was more of a scouting day.  I was up at 2:30 am and only thinking of the days event. Knowing it was way to early to hit the road, I just tossed and turn til 3:45. The hell with it, get up and get on the road. No matter my age, I just want to go.LOL  I get to my spot hours before light, but it gave me time to get set up and retie a couple of rods. They didnt need to be, but I had time to kill. I could hear waves crashing the shore. I thought this odd, as there was no wind. Talking to a fella that was there, said yesterday the winds had water rolling in big time.  Once there was a bit of light on the horizon, I started my drift out over 3 ft rollers.  I could hear the talk on the banks about my craft. All positve. Look at that guy, thats cool. (I wonder if that will be the same when I cut a path during the busy steelhead season?) LOL  Not having been out there before, I had asked the help of my buddy James about the lay of the area, I headed out on his advise..Once I thought I was where I was to be, I started to throw a spinner.  GBay sunrise, another first.      After about a half hour of that, I switched up to floating a row bag till there was enough light to see where I was.     No luck with either baits, I had to go with  my ole fav. The Kwik fish. A few casts in and fish on. Landed. Bucket list complete. Not a big fish, but landed. Bucket fish completed. A half hour later, line goes limp on a retrive. Reel fast and pull up. Fish on. Number two. Im like this is so awesome. Drifting out and rowwing back (didnt bother with the flippers) several times, I worked the whole mouth. No depth finder required. Just look down and i knew where I was going and knew when I was on my spot after a few times. Fishing with long rods on the toon can be frustrating. Im sure it will get easier.  Anyhoo, took me a while to get this video together. Need to get some help on editing.  My first salmon and second on the toon. Yah, I sound like a giddy school boy. Like I care. LOL Im having fun.  Cant wait to do this again.   "
981580,Terry,2016-09-15 23:01:00,14456,cool bud wish I didnt have to work today
981581,Meegs,2016-09-15 23:08:00,249,Lol..   i dont fish a quickfish too often anymore but when I do thats my go to pattern. Got one of my bigger specks  in Algonquin on that very one!  Good job with the video and the fishing buddy!  Wtg!
981583,spincast,2016-09-15 23:25:00,3279,that looks like  a blast.
981585,esoxansteel,2016-09-15 23:58:00,1307,"Great vid, and getting away from the river rat race is the way to go Brian, and the smaller the craft the better, im sure you got towed around a bit by Mr. Nook"

981611,Old Ironmaker,2016-09-16 10:48:00,8243,You need someone other than yourself filming. That I would like to see.
981614,ckewley,2016-09-16 11:11:00,699,Awesome video man!
981619,AKRISONER,2016-09-16 12:47:00,5558,well done!  a buddy and i also plan on tossing flies for salmon this fall from the rafts...should be interesting!
981625,LeXXington,2016-09-16 14:07:00,1928,cool looks like fun !!
981632,TheTallPolak,2016-09-16 14:31:00,26,"Not sure what your setup is, but you can get a shoulder mount (with a slight elevation for a ""over the shoulder"" view) or pole extension and strap a GoPro to it?  Looks like a great experience, That's something I need to add to my bucket list now!"
981648,misfish,2016-09-16 18:04:00,29133,"Thanks a bunch guys. As for filming, I gave the crew the day off, along with today. Maybe next time. LOL   I had to go back up there this morning. Hell, gas is 88.9 a lt in Stayner,and the Ram sips it like fine wine, so why not.  I made it out at dark, threw the toon anchor out and just sat and waited for daylight to come. Even watched a guy fight a fish while sipping on my cup of java. Once the light came, the water was as clear as gin. Totally different then yesterday. Went from east to south. You talk about trying to stay controled in that wind and the current of the river. Was a bit frustrating, but figured it out. I think a small drift sock is in order for this type of fishing from the toon. The bite was slow, boats were way out. I did have a few short strikes. Managed to get me an eater which is just fine by me.  Got to talking with  some of the regulars there today when I came off . They were interested in my set up. Good bunch of fellas. The one guy I talked to yesterday,  offered  to open the fish cleaning station for me to use yesterday  and did today as well.  Looks like were in for some rain tonight, and all day saturday. Gives me a reason to head on down to woodyville  get my shepard peppers and get them roasted and stored. Might even get some roasted garlic done in a few jars.  A short video from today.  "
981649,Old Ironmaker,2016-09-16 18:10:00,8243,That would be a blast fishing from a Toon. I have never seen one close up or far away for that matter. I can see a good size King pulling you around Brian. What does the whole set up weigh Brian? A Go Pro stick is a great idea then we can see you too.
