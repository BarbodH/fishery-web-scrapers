While fishin today, a lot of the anglers were saying that the fish are heading back to the lake. Does this mean the run is over? or are fresh fish heading into the rivers for a while?  Thanks  Dave"
193105,Casey123,2008-04-27 19:24:00,461,"I am by no means an expert...as far as I know though, most fish runs in Southern Ontario are finished.  The fish that are being caught are mostly fall backs(heading back to the lake). If you head a little further North the runs are just begining.  Sault ste. Marie - St. Marys river run, does not get going in earnest until Early MAy and lasts until July depending on weather and water levels.  If you can make the run up for a weekend it is truley awesome. Also some of the tribs north of Sault Ste Marie - like the Goulais and tribs into Pancake bay are just starting as well.  I am sure this holds true the further North you go. Some tribs hold fish longer then others.  Many of the tribs off of the Notty hold fish well into late spring/early summer due to the distance back to the Notty and then into G Bay."
193108,fishing n autograph,2008-04-27 19:34:00,2540,Does that mean most of the fish are gone? and going back through the next few weeks would be a waste of time?
193109,Sinker,2008-04-27 19:49:00,8692,Drop backs are usually more willing to bite than fish that haven't yet spawned. They're tired and hungry. Fish the lower stretches.......they'll stack up in the bigger pools until the water gets too warm. Then they head out to the lake.  Sinker
193113,canadian_copper,2008-04-27 20:20:00,925,THEY PUT A FEED ON AS THEY DROP BACK TO THE LAKE!! 25MM IN THE FORECAST FOR TONIGHT AND TOMOR WILL FLUSH A MANY OF STEEL BACK OUT INTO THE LAKE!!
193116,Gravyboat,2008-04-27 20:29:00,44,"A lost of fish aren't even done spawning yet.  Depends on the trib.  There was a lot of fishing pressure yesturday and today.  Many times the fish will drop into the deep pools and hold tight.  Out of sight, out of mind.... and guys will say ""I'm not seeing them, I'm not catching them, they must be gone to the lake."""
193122,fishing n autograph,2008-04-27 21:23:00,2540,"good point, i saw a lot of guys hook into fish today even with the pressure...gonna go out tues-thurs and see what happens!  Lotsa time off...love trout fishing, never been too good at it!  Dave"
193137,Canuck2fan,2008-04-27 21:57:00,1444,Last year the last time I went out on a Huron trib was June 9th and I got fish..... I expect they will be similar this year. Many fish were still coming in to spawn last Sunday.
