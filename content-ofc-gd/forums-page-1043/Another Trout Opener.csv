Not counting the little ones, landed 4 fish, and a BIG fish got away! It just kept on going down stream, eventually it hooked me up good on a log.  Before I sleep, pictures!  Start slow   Few hrs later   I'll try to improve the fish handle, so no mud next time.   Its like glowing out of my hands   Crazy fish!   Going to bed now. If I wake up on Sunday, I'll go again. This opener day fishing is really tiring, can't even tie a Parlamor knot right now, my vision has becoming blurry, and I can't even feed the line through the hook eye!"
