What are they doing there in the winter?  I would really like to know the answer to this question. I've heard that fall run Steelhead are in the rivers feeding on salmon eggs. That doesn't make a lot of sense to me. It also doesn't explain why they are in the rivers in the winter.  Does anyone know the definitive answer to this question?"

193303,Guest skeeter99,2008-04-28 09:09:00,0,"some spawn in fall but the majority in the spring, so there is no definitive answer  3 different websites say fall and spring, I know of some streams that have bigger runs of rainbows in the fall than they do in the spring and their are nobody fishing them!!!!  that is probably why there is a sept 30 closer for trout on most streams since there are some spawners coming up  below are cut and pasted from various websites  Rainbow trout are usually 3 - 4 years old when they spawn. Stream-dwelling rainbows migrate upstream to spawn. Those in lakes migrate into tributary streams or spawn in shallow areas of rock or gravel if no streams are available. Some steelhead spawn in the fall, but most spawn in the spring mostly in April in Minnesota. Water temperatures must go above 5°C (41° F) and streams must rise (from rain) or the steelhead will not spawn. The female scrapes out a nest in the gravel and is joined by one or two males. The males lay side by side with the female in the middle and the fish release their eggs and sperm at the same time. The female covers the eggs with the gravel she removed to build the nest. She will spawn repeatedly until all her eggs are released. There is no parental care of the nest or the eggs. A single female may lay 400-3,000 eggs depending on her size. The embryos develop for 20-80 days depending on the water temperature. They hatch into what are called alevins (free-swimming embryos with huge yolk sacs) and stay down in the gravel for another 2-3 weeks while their fins develop. After that time, they swim up and begin feeding in the stream or lake. Migrating rainbows live and grow in the stream for 2-3 years before they migrate downstream or out into a lake  another exerpt  Breeding:  With this fast growth, rainbow trout reach sexual maturity earlier than other trout.  Rainbow trout may spawn first when they reach about 12- 16 inches in length, which is usually at the end of their second year (Roberts 2001).  During late winter or early spring, when water temperatures are rising, the maturing adult rainbow trout seek out the shallow gravel riffles or a suitable clear water stream.  Spawning occurs from late March through early July, depending on the location and conditions of the winter.  Most trout spawn in streams, rivers, and lakes with gravel bottoms and steady water flow.  Trout spawn in spring or autumn.  In early spring, rainbow trout move upstream to a spawning area, then the female choose a suitable site usually a shallow, gravel area at the beginning of a stretch of choppy water.  Then she turns on her side and beats her tail up and down, scooping out a shallow nest or redd.  When the redd is prepared, she positions herself over it.  Then the male courts her by swimming near her and shaking his body.  When the female is ready to spawn she moves to the bottom of the redd and presses her belly against the gravel.  Then 200 to 8,000 eggs are deposited in the redd, fertilized by a male and covered with gravel.  Hatching normally takes a few weeks to as much as four months, depending on water temperature.  A few more weeks may be required for the tiny fry to emerge from the gravel.  Then the small trout gather in groups and take shelter along the stream margins or protected lakeshore, feeding on crustaceans, plant material, and aquatic insects and their larvae.  The young trout eat mostly invertebrates (animals without backbones), including insects.  Rainbow trout then stay in a similar habitat for the first two or three years then move into the larger water of lakes and streams and turn to more of a diet of fish, salmon carcasses, eggs, and even small mammals   and another  most steelhead spawn from December through April in small streams and tributaries where cool, well oxygenated water is available year round. The female selects a site with gravel substrate where there is good flow through the gravel. She then digs a nest, called a redd, and deposits eggs, which the male then fertilizes. The eggs are covered by gravels and cobbles when the female excavates another redd just upstream.  The length of time it takes for eggs to hatch is heavily dependent on water temperature. In hatcheries with carefully controlled conditions, steelhead eggs hatch after 30 days at a temperature of 51° F. The optimal temperature for egg incubation is between 44 and 50° F (7-10° C). Eggs hatch sooner in warmer water, but the young fish are smaller and generally have lower survival rates. If the temperature goes too high, eggs will not hatch at all. After hatching, the developing steelhead will remain in the gravel for another four to six weeks. During this time, they are called alevins and obtain nutrients from a yolk sack attached to their body. When they emerge from the gravel, they are called fry, and are able to catch their own food.  Newly emerged fry move to shallow, protected areas of the stream (usually in the stream margins). They establish feeding areas which they defend. Most juveniles can be found in riffles, although larger ones will move to pools or deep runs."
193323,Gravyboat,2008-04-28 11:32:00,44,I would recommend a the book 'Steelhead Float Fishing' by Jim Butler  All the information you asked for + more.  It’s a good read.
