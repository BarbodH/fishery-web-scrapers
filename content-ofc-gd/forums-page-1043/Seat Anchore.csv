192899,Guest lundboy,2008-04-27 02:43:00,0,have the bolts come loose or have the floor boards rotted out?
192914,Scott S,2008-04-27 02:59:00,203,Look's like the bolts are pulling out of the floor. The floor doesn't seem to be too bad.!
192921,SlowPoke,2008-04-27 03:10:00,2984,"I'm afraid it's probably time for a new floor. If it is a typical pedestal seat it is likely screwed to the floor and not bolted. A flush base will have a 2""-3"" hole to accept the pedestal... you can try this; -Remove the base -Set the base on two aluminium flat stock bars 2.5""x16""x1/8"" (WxLxT) -Mark the aluminium centering two of the base holes on one bar and two base holes on the other bar so it looks somewhat like this =0= -Mark holes at the ends of both bars -Drill and tap the holes in the bars -Lay the bars on the boat floor aligning the old base holes and mark the floor where new holes will be made at the ends of the bars -Ensure there is no obstructions under the floor for the new holes and drill -Slide the bar stock into the base hole. You may need to bend it a little but it should spring back -Locate the holes at the end of the bars and bolt them in place using stainless bolts, finish washers, red loktite and sealer -Locate the base in its original position and bolt to the bar stock in the same fashion -Reinstall the screws adding sealer  The bar stock mounted by 4 bolts in the wet wood should provide as much or more stability than you ever had and the additional 4 bolts at the ends ease the installation and add to stability bolting through what should probably be dry wood.  Just make sure you have the room under your floor to do so. If not, modify the plan a bit and it will buy you some time before replacing your floor. -Brian"
192985,Greencoachdog,2008-04-27 12:51:00,8163,"Yup! Time to pull up the decking!  If your seat is the typical pedestal type with the round base, it will be secured with oval head machine screws and star nuts on the underside. The star/tee nuts have prolly stripped out or rusted away and your plywood is prolly in bad shape.  There's no way of fixing this problem that I can think of without removing your plywood decking.  Backing plates like Slowpoke suggested are a real good fix, you can also rotate your base and drill new holes and install new star nuts if the plywood isn't in too bad of shape... but I'm thinkin' you're not going to like what you see when you remove the decking (rotten wood)."
