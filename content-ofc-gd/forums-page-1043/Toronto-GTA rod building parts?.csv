And i mean WELL stocked, not just 2 bottles of flexcoat, a big box of mismatched guides, and some wrapping threads.    I checked a few stores online and coudln't find much.  I wrote to angling specialties on the east side 2-3 weeks ago because i heard they have some things and got no answer.  I'm actually in waterloo and we have 1 store that i can go to for some random parts.   I've been getting most of my things online and it's so hard to get exactly what you need because you're never sure about sizing and colors until it's in your hands.  thanks."
