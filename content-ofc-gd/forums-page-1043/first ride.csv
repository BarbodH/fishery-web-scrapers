193124,MoriaRiverMan,2008-04-27 21:33:00,314,Got boat out today in river.........great to see it almost back to normal levels  I thought the boat had a carb issue but seemed great today...........at about 25% throtle it does loose all spark it seems for about a sec.........then fine for 5 sec and then looses spark..........   Runs like a champ at WOT and IDLE..  Any idea's?  Spark plug gap maybe??   They are bran new.  its a 91 or so 20HP evinrude.  Thanks Derrick
193148,danc,2008-04-27 22:32:00,4677,I doubt that it's losing spark. A gummed up carb would be my guess.
193235,MoriaRiverMan,2008-04-28 01:41:00,314,any easy way to check fuel line?
