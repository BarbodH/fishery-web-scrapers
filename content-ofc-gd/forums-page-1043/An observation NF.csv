192916,HTHM,2008-04-27 03:02:00,4082,Is it just me or has the medium size coffee gotten smaller when the prices rose?
192970,JohnF,2008-04-27 11:38:00,3494," One of my students brought me a ""medium"" the other day after lunch. I didn't want to sound ungrateful but it occurred to me that that ""medium"" sure looked small. I always buy XL when I get my own, particularly since they shrunk 'em a bit in the last downsizing.  I expect we'll be seeing an XXL any time now.  JF"
