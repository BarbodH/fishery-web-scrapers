But when i walk in to bass pro there is a wall of line to choose from now i dont want to get into species specifics but what is the difference between line we all had when we 10 that just looks like dental floss from mono, and braid. One thing that always confuses me to is that when a reel says it excels at 14lb line, what is 14lb line in mono and in bread, does someone now a trick or equation to convert your regular line into mono and bread. any feed back is once again much appreciated sincerly white007"
192924,mistaredone,2008-04-27 03:18:00,913,That 14lbs rating is in mono.  Just under the rating on your super braid box in small text it will tell you its equivelence in mono.  ie 65 braid=14 mono
192930,SlowPoke,2008-04-27 03:37:00,2984,"Your spool might suggest 6/170, 8/120, 10/100 (lb/yrds mono) Most companies will provide line diameter on packaging. If you want to put braid on, look for the highest capacity on your reel. In this case 6/170. Find the line diamter of 6lb mono (.25mm) and load up with braid of the same diamter. So... 6lb Trilene XT Mono (.25mm or .010"") 8lb P-Line Floro (.23mm or .009"") 20lb P-Line Braid (.28mm or .011"" ... will all yield about 170 yards on the spool in this example  Some manufacturers will advertise thier braid as 20lb equiv. to 6lb mono diameter -Brian"
