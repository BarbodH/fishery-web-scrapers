Without the breeze, yesterdays hot spots appeared as shallow, barren flats. We did find a couple of good fish on the sunny-side of the bay holding tight to a patch of dead cattails. After a couple of hours, the wind picked up.  We were exploring another bay looking for more cattail... As we reached the far end of the bay we could see that the wind was blowing straight down the channel. This looked very similar to yesterday's spot, so we anchored in the lee of an islet a fished around a couple of docks and some shoals. In four hours we landed over one hundred Crappie!  They saved a few for a fish-fry. The action was so fast we sometimes had three on at the same time. A piece of plastic worm under a bobber would do the trick, but a slip rig, a small Darter type jig plus a Crappie tube or grub was more fun. Personally I was glad when the others decided to called it quits!  I was starting to get tired...in a good way...grin. Garry2rs"
