193079,muttfish,2008-04-27 17:27:00,20,"went camping for the first time this season in dunnville, wind was blowing the water all over the place, got a few bites but landed no fish, OK so around 10 pm the wind died down and the creek was calm until about 5 billion little fish no more than 2 inches started swimming up the creek, the creeks 60 feet wide maybe 6 to 8 feet deep and as far as are flashlight could shine the whole creek was swarming with these fish, the water went from calm to sounding like a trickling brook, I've camped here for ten years all throughout the seasons and have seen this before, there was more fish in the creek than water, what could these be? no more than 2 inches long, silver and plentiful."

193087,brifishrgy,2008-04-27 17:39:00,559,more then likely they are emerald shinners ... they swarm into the creeks and rivers this time of year
193098,GbayGiant,2008-04-27 18:27:00,1780,"Could be anything, what kind of species are in the river ? are there any species spawning now ? could just be bait fish, if you find those bait balls out in your boat in shallow water or on the radar you hit the lottery, I've seen some giant ones and you can guarantee predators will be very close."
193132,bucktail,2008-04-27 21:52:00,1857,"brifishrgy is probably right, its that time of the year for emerald shiners in the great lakes."
193145,Fishmaster,2008-04-27 22:15:00,920,Forsure Shinners ...might be less now my net went over them lol..
193288,xrap,2008-04-28 03:44:00,683,"Yes they were emerald shinners, I was thier Friday night and witnessed the same thing."
