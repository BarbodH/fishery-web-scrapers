Install a small kitchen down stairs, drywall, pluming and electrical, some painting, a small retaining wall that needs to be built outside, some new shingles on my garage roof. Thought I'd offer it to any OFNr's first. If anyone is interested please let me know ASAP as I want to get it going fairly soon.  Thanks  Cliff"
