Sitting 8th in the field of 70. Pretty crazy bast-off this morning with 70 salmon boats and some big rigs.  The boat next to us was powered with twin 250 Yamahas - boy, could he fly!  Here is a pic of the motley crew with the 5 fish that we weighed in.     Thanks fellas for a great day on the water!!!  Wish us luck tomorrow.  :-)"

Thanks for a great weekend guys!   Bowen - if you find a clear Lite Bite Slider Diver in the boat, drop me a PM.  :-)  BTW, if you looking for some fun king action, get in touch with Bowen (Live2fish) at http://www.reelhard.net"
