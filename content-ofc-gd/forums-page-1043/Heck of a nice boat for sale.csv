192893,HTHM,2008-04-27 02:16:00,4082,http://hamilton.kijiji.ca/c-cars-vehicles-...QQAdIdZ48379928 I have seen this boat and I think it is very nice.
192973,JohnF,2008-04-27 11:53:00,3494,"I have only limited experience with outboards and that was years ago, but these pics got me wondering about something. Is there an advantage to having two small units versus one larger one, aside from the redundancy factor?  Is it economy? I doubt that 2 separate units are cheaper than one larger one. I also doubt the two together burn less fuel.  Is it torque - two props delivering better torque or speed than one?  For sure the hardware associated with running two has to be more convoluted and expensive.  So what's the trick?  JF"
192987,cranks bait,2008-04-27 12:53:00,721,"I'm no expert by any means on this.  I would guess that you could get the same speed from two engines running at a lower rpm than just one.  Thus easier wear on the motor and maybe less gas consumption.  Biggest factor may be, the ability to get home.  If one bags out you still have one to run, could make a big difference on something like Lake Ontario.  That's my edumacated guess."

192994,cranks bait,2008-04-27 13:12:00,721,"Look at that, I just learned something.  I was way off on the RPM thing."
193070,Canuck2fan,2008-04-27 17:00:00,1444," That makes sense but then some charters are so busy they can't do maintenance on one motor let alone two LOL. Been on three charters over the years and on all three at some point they had motor ""issues"". I wasn't exactly thrilled when the captains all said gee I been meaning to fix that but been too busy. HUH? sorry no tip for you today... Thankfully in all three cases my dad who is a mechanic was able to tell them how to get going again."
193075,JohnF,2008-04-27 17:14:00,3494," I can understand the safety aspect (I called it redundancy). We see it regularly on the smaller dive boats down in the Caribbean.  As for the rpm thang - I don't know this but is there perhaps some advantage loadwise (mileage etc), or at least speedwise, with two smaller props spinning as one bigger one doing all the work.  JF"
193294,jace,2008-04-28 04:31:00,472,"There are many reasons to choose one over the other besides safety.  1- should you decide on twin screws, two outboards is significantly cheaper than 2 inboards 2- with 2 screws, you can run a boat with less draft with the same power in the water. 3- twin screws absolutely spank a single prop in maneuverability if you have the skills and know how...for example, making the boat move perpendicular to a dock...i.e. sideways. 4-single screw will have better top end speed for 2 comparable boats due to less drag 5-sometimes single large engines, in or outboard cannot drop down slow enough for trolling without manually adjusting the engine or the right prop 6- two engines at near top speed will be cheaper to run than one that's always screaming at top rpm (gas, maintenance, etc)  i'm sure i'm missing things but that's some of it."
193477,jjcanoe,2008-04-28 19:40:00,744,The motor on the right is the main and the one on the left is the kicker motor for trolling!!!!  I wonder if he actually owns the boat or if it's scratch and dent merchanise. ie: scratch over the serial #  Sounds like a great deal if it's legit or not in serious need of repair  jjcanoe
