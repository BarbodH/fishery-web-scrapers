The man, identified as Sergio Girimonte, had travelled to a Manitoulin Island resort with his brother and cousin to go fishing. The trio went to the Kagawong River, about 40 kilometres west of Little Current, early Saturday morning to fish.  Girimonte was wading in the water when he was swept away by the powerful current at about 7:45 a.m. at the mouth of the river, police said.  A search began immediately with the help of Manitoulin OPP, Canadian Coast Guard and the North Shore Search and Rescue Team.  The OPP Underwater Search and Recovery Unit was called to assist and began searching at daybreak on Sunday.  The fisherman's body was found at about 11:20 a.m., police said.  A local coroner was called to the scene and ordered a post-mortem examination, which will take place today in Sudbury, to determine the cause of death."

They swamped it and were swimming. When I, later, politely tried to suggest that this lake with the current wind was too big for their boat, I got the response... ""No, boat is good..."" He was pi$$ed that we had failed to recover one set of rubber boots.  You just can't teach common sense."
