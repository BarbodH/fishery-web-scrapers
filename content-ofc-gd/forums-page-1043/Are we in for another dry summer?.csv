I cant handle another repeat of last year, or even the year before for that matter. I hate seeing creeks running almost dry and large rivers like the Thames and the Maitland running at pitiful levels.  Farmers need rain to get these grains growing that the world is in such a high demand for. Heres hoping we get rain, and lots of it soon."
