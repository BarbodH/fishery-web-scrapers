Perch, Crappie, sunfish etc.....  We will be starting from the UOW and only be going for a couple of hours. I was thinking about Shad's Mills for a couple of hours of fishing.  Does anyone have recommendations?  I am leaving in 20 minutes....(yeah yeah...last minute request) but will check the web when I get to waterloo (1pm or so) I am not asking for ""secret fishing spots"" just fun ones.  thanks,  forrest"
