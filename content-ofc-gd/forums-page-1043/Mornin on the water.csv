So i pulled into the parking lot and at sun up I was the 25th car...... but everyone was standing around the first pool...so I moved on to the next one and shared it with another guy for about 30 minutes....then the stampeding heard came through the water and I was standing shoulder to shoulder with everyone at every pool for about 5kms....  I went 0/1 but i hooked into the largest rainbow i've ever seen in person! Broke my fly off though, oh well....everyone else was slayin' 'em on roe bags so i'm going shopping for a trout road lol!"

JUST KIDDING BRO'  That is one reason I dont fish the tribs much anymore...well, that and location. It is somewhat of a P'off........if you know the crowd tho' and they'll let you into the drift its not to bad but personally Bud.. Just cant do that anymore. I fished my local trib for near 30yrs.........its still not to bad as long as your south of the golf course... Oh Oh...gave that one away.... Sorry to hear about the rod.....is it gauranteed? It was the rod Huh?..not a road?"
