192897,Mike the Pike,2008-04-27 02:25:00,3421,"That time of year came fast once again 2nd day of the trout opener here in La Belle Province of Quebec :my son Ryan and I were ready. This year I invited 2 great friends of mine Kenny and GlennK some of you have met them in Quinte last November.  Wake up time was brutal   After a quick stop at Timmies the 4 Troutkiteers got into our vehicles and burned our expensive gas   Son Ryan just before we start our day on the water a few Tim Horton cookies and some fresh bed head from the snooze he took during our close to 2 hour drive especially since I drove 5kms past our exit.   Fish are not biting Dad can I steer the boat.The kid wants to know why I bought a tiller. He would prefer a side console Its all your fault Greencoachdog.He reads these tiller and console wars. Ok forget about this.............   Can you believe it we had a stowaway.Bite  Me Hello Gunwhale Heaver       Kenny and Glennk in Glenns boat.      Trolling did not seem to produce met up with some friends who did manage to find a Brown  ,Laker ,12 pound pike and some smallies. while casting.  I decided to try Jigging with one of Bernie's Jigs chartreuse with a white and pink worm a real mismatch of colours.  My son had enough of trolling it was time for a break .This was also an opportunity to pratice using the new bow mount electric motor since I had never owned one.  After getting the hang of it quite well I thought I had snagged bottom in 6ft of water. Anyhoo I pull with all my might and up pops this thing.Now son Ryan can't net the slimy hunter because he is peeing in the piss bucket and we started laughing really hard while Mr.Pike is tail dancing.Ryan finally zips up picks up the net and scoops up yet another Pike from yours truly .Why do these things seem to find me. Since October 2007 that is all I have caught Pike more Pike and Pike.  Torpedo slimeballs.  A quick pic and she was quickly realeased     That was all for the day not our best trout opener but a good time with my son and 2 great friends GlennK and kenny.The weather was chilly in the mornin but beautiful all Day.   Alot more reading to do but I am getting the hang of it.Hard to recognize fish on this thing.      Shot of Mont-Orford Ski resort.Yes snow in late April.   A quick stop at timmies my eye lids were barely open after having to wake up a 3am. Shot of Bromont Ski resort.That is glenn and Kenny ahaed of me.  Not full of fish folks but I enjoyed my day to the fullest Hello Spring BYE BYE Winter.  Enjoy MTP"

192942,huntervasili,2008-04-27 06:46:00,1604,Nice going Mike! I have the same alarm clock as you too... I think I am wearing away the snooze button though
192956,medmart,2008-04-27 10:28:00,587,Great report MTP glad you and your son had a good day on the water you can't beat that  Rob
192958,Greencoachdog,2008-04-27 10:46:00,8163,"Great report and pics Mike!!!  , and that's a pretty nice Pike!  Why do you always have to drive so far to go fishin'? Aren't there any places to fish close by?"
192969,lew,2008-04-27 11:34:00,12767,Good to hear everything's working out well with the new boat Mike and now I'll know what to look for on Quinte in a couple weeks. See ya down there.
192971,b2kptbo,2008-04-27 11:48:00,1505,"Boated a fish, everything worked well, good company, can't beat it, thanks for the report..."
192983,ccmtcanada,2008-04-27 12:41:00,7971,"Mike...this was a great report!  Getting out in the new ride had to feel awesome.  Despite the slow fishing, I'm sure you were grinning ear to ear as you piloted your Lund around out there....LOL.  You'll get plenty of slime in her Mike....the memories have only just begun in this new chapter....and I have a feeling your son will be in many of those stories....stories he'll be telling his own kids one day."
193066,Mike the Pike,2008-04-27 16:39:00,3421, Yes Carl the Lakers were much deeper than last year but some were caught in the 15 to 25 ft range.  The water temperature was much colder than usual.40 to 47F   last year temps were above 50F.  Oh well next year.  MTP
193068,Mike the Pike,2008-04-27 16:43:00,3421, Well Glenn Mon Ami Unlike Ontario there are trout lakes but most are not close to Montreal the best ones are far away so thats life no big Lake O hear .  I would like to buy riggers but can't justify the cost of using them only 2 to 3 times per year.  There are trout in the St.Lawrence but getting to them is risky because of rocks and Rapids I have tried the shore spots without success.  I will be fishin for Walleye next weekend In Kenny's boat.  MTP
193093,Greencoachdog,2008-04-27 18:17:00,8163,  You'll prolly catch something... fishin' out of a console!!!
193094,mattyk,2008-04-27 18:18:00,2110,"great report, thanks for sharing."
193247,carll2,2008-04-28 02:06:00,443, will you be putting riggers on her????? damn nice boat im really jealous lol
193251,danc,2008-04-28 02:19:00,4677,Nice Mike. Nothing like a new boat to give you the urge to get out more.
