193131,Canuck2fan,2008-04-27 21:52:00,1444,"it is simple.....  If you don't have a machine (which you don't need)  First only do this on a tile floor even one egg on a carpet and broken will stink for months.  Take a tv tray cover with wax paper. Lay out the pieces of netting I buy the precut ones. Take a plastic spoon and put the eggs on the netting. Rainbow eggs about 10 to 15... Then place on your floaters use lots. (for drifting no floaters) Gather the edges of the netting form a ball then use spider wire thread about 5 wraps, then snap it off. Cut of the excess netting All done.  Another tip is to have a few paper towels beside you already torn off the roll and a plastic bag to put all the refuse in so you can take it out to the trash in one pile...  The first time you do it is a little daunting but soon you will tying the right sizes and colours at the rate of about 100 per hour."
