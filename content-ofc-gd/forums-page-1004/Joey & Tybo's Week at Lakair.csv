221002,Joey,2008-06-29 16:08:00,9122,"Got back late yesterday from another fantastic week at Lakair.  We got there early Saturday after Paul got off work too late to drive up Friday night.  By the time he got home and the truck was loaded it was 1:30 a.m. so we decided to get a few hours sleep and we were off by 6 a.m.  Saw a few of these on the way and knew we were close.    We barely had time to set up camp and the pike tournament was starting.  We blasted off behind Irishfield and Spiel to get to our fav pike spot.  Took a pic of these rednecks in a weird coloured boat    Got some shots of some OFNr's while waiting for the fish fry and while prizes were being awarded.  Ladywalleye (Shelley)    Jaden and Monique, and Muskiestudd (Chris) hearing no evil I presume    Greencoachdog (Glen) enjoying what does not look like moonshine, but just regular ordinary rye.    A nice pic of Roy, but unfortunately its a bit out of focus.    A good shot of Beans (Norm)    Dawson (Marty's son) taking home one of many of his prizes.  What a sweetie that little boy is.    Art (Aplumma) leaving the prize table.    Irishfield (Wayne) on his way to the prize table.    Daplumma (Joe), Art and Glen sitting pretty!    TJ and Art having a moment.    Monday Lew and Spiel (Chris) packed up and left us, sniff, sniff.  I enjoyed our almost pickerel fishing Chris    We fished Muskrat Bay and even ventured over to Merganser Bay, and there was alot of active weather.  These kept popping up most days then we'd have some good thunderstorms.  Monday was a doozie that lasted a good 5 hours.    These guys were all over the place,    which eventually turned into our friends........    Saw this little fellow fisherman out on the shores of Muskrat one day    This little guy was very friendly.  Paul even got him to do tricks, as you can see him jumping in the second picture for a peanut.      We also found this little cutie wandering around    Off a fishing we will go....    We caught ALOT of pike.  This guy, I'm happy to say, like my new homemade bucktail.  I had many follows and catches with all my homemade lures.    Caught a bass, while pickerel fishing    This guy went for the perch coloured musky bait    A bass while musky fishing    More pike    I thought this was hilarious.  Paul had put the perch shad rap on the dash and then later his wet bucktail.  On the drive back the bucktail dried and it made the shad rap look like it had a mohawk    I think this place is in need of repair, ha ha.    Can you see the face    more pike        Finally got into some pickerel the last day there.  Some slot sized tho.  But it was a great night to be out in the weather and the mosquitos were not bad that night for some reason.    A mini perch    And our last sunset before heading home the next morning.    Kevin visited us one night and told us that there are these new tree frogs that have started living in the trees.  I tried to get a video so you can hear them and it turned out great, until the end!!!!!!!    Here's another vid of Paul trying to get a campfire to stay lit while it rained like cats and dogs on Monday.    It was a super week and we had some great conversations with Wayne and Leah in their cabin a few wet evenings.  Richard Clemens and his wife Patsy joined us also.  Can't wait to go back up.  On a sad note, Leslie's mother died during the week.  Kevin played Taps on his bugle in memorium.  Leslie did not come back to camp so our sincerest condolances to you Les.  Joey & Paul"
221006,Spiel,2008-06-29 16:27:00,9065,"....Fabulous pictures Miss Joey. Looks like you guys had some good fishing after we all left yous.

Anyway, we all had a great time.  When did Leslie's mother pass ?   I know she left for Timmins early on Wednesday am and didn't see her later in the day.  We pulled out around 4:30am on Thursday."
