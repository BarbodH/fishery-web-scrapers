Had a couple of knock-offs from spoons on the riggers. Then hit this one on a Spindoctor and fly from the core.    Ran to the fence to check out if the action had started yet, but not takers.  On a separate note, been busy doing a bunch of things to make the small vessel fish bigger.  Starting to impersonate a Salmon boat...      Still a couple more add-ons to come though.  Bring on the derby!!!  :-)"
221882,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-07-01 21:06:00,0,Great Report. I have almost the same boat! What H.P is that? A 90? I'm afraid to venture to far out in Lake O with my 40 H.P.

222086,silveradosheriff,2008-07-02 11:56:00,1025," It is the F-90, it is a great motor. No problem heading out on the Lake with your 40, check the weather (and wind) forecasts before heading out and when in doubt, fish skinny.  :-)"
