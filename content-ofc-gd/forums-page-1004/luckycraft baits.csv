Turnes out the bait is held together with small braid stainless wire. Well one side has broke. I have only caught maybe 6 fish with this bait and all small mouth,no pike. I dont dare use any good bass baits in pike waters.  Anyhoo,I am surprised that a braided wire like that would break in the body. So,does anyone know if they have some kind of warrenty on thier baits? Thanks"

222097,bucktail,2008-07-02 12:55:00,1857,For the price of them i hope so. I have a beautiful perch bait that I am always afraid to use because of pike and muskies.
