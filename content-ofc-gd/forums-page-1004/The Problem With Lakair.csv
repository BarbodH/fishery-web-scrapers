219485,ccmtcanada,2008-06-25 17:15:00,7971,"You weren't at Lakair?  Huh....could have sworn you were.  Then again, it was all a blur.  See you again next year John.  Man I'm so confused."

219673,Greencoachdog,2008-06-26 00:32:00,8163,"The real problem with Lakair is it only happens once a year and is too short!!!   You not being there is your own fault John, try to remedy that next year eh?  I'll have a nice ""Lakair Martini"" waiting for you!!!

219675,Greencoachdog,2008-06-26 00:33:00,8163," We missed you this year Jack, but are already lookin' forward to seein' ya next year!!!"
219724,JohnF,2008-06-26 02:44:00,3494," Sounds like the stuff my buddy brings from Tennessee. He puts fresh strawberries in his, I think to give it a hint of colour so you can see the spills and don't accidentally drop a smoke in it.  JF"
222047,irishfield,2008-07-02 05:33:00,26272,"It's alright John! I'll bring ""Lakair"" back up in October.... when I get time to do a report on the whole affair !!"
