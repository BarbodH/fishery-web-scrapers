221726,blehst,2008-07-01 13:00:00,7,im getting a week off from work next week and have been eyeing white lake as a potential fishing hole. can anyone recomend it. were looking for mostly bass considering the ottawa river holds a greater amount of walleye as well as the madawaska river which is all close by. so if anyone can recommend this lake it would be cool thanks
222139,blehst,2008-07-02 14:56:00,7,"well i was hoping someone could answer some questions that i had. whats the water clarity like on white lake?, is it a deep lake at points? lots of rocks shoals for crankbaits?  anyways hope someone can help me out"
222142,Gerritt,2008-07-02 15:17:00,6129,First off welcome to OFC  It is considered good manners to introduce yourself and tell us a bit of info before asking for tips on specific water bodies  I am sure someone here has fished it before and would be happy to lend you a bit of advice.  Good luck on you're trip!  G

222150,blehst,2008-07-02 15:35:00,7,oh im sorry to be rude :S. I'm Alex haha ive been planning this little trip for a while now and have been trying to figure some good spots on this lake. im 20 and i live in ottawa. have a cottage in dacre/ on constant lake. but the fishing there has become rather dry. so white lake is going to be a new place to try out. thanks for looking:)
222236,jnic,2008-07-02 20:29:00,158,pretty good bass fishing. smallys or large mouth. it is not a clear lake. we usually fish deep weeds in four mile bay. there are also alot of shoals. good luck
