222315,MuddyWater,2008-07-03 00:09:00,218,went out chucking some dry flys for some browns but the water was high and coloured from the rains we have been having. i put on a big egg suckin leech and WAM nailed a nice rainbow with some wicked jumps she was very skinny and tired out quick in the warm water. the next pool BAM this nice big butterscotch brown!! i think i can keep catching rainbows until they start running again in the fall with the way this year has been! peace.
