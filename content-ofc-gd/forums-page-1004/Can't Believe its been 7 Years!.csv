221030,capt_hooked,2008-06-29 18:02:00,212,"Leslie and I would like to thank all the OFNers for making it up to Lakair again this year.  We appreciate the business, but more importantly we enjoyed your company!  My apologies for not making it out to Tombstone for the shore lunch this year. I hope to be better organized next year as that lunch is as much fun for me ... as it was/is for you!  Just spent a couple of hours reading over all the posts. It is great reading the comments and some of the pictures are incredible! (is there an OFC photo contest?) I am disapointed that I did not get to hear the OFC Anthem, so I want all of you to practice it well and we'll be expecting to hear a performance next year.  On a sad note, Leslie lost her mother on Thursday evening....... Mary was 78 years old - a wonderful mother, mother-in-law and grandmother.   She loved spending time here at the lake - I think she appreciated the quietness, the water and the trees; we shared that feeling.  Mary, you will be greatly missed!  There'll be an empty chair on our back deck, a reminder of a sweet lady.   the cap't and leslie"
221032,Joey,2008-06-29 18:08:00,9122,"Yes, that is very sad news Kevin.  I hope Leslie is coping well with it, as she knew it was coming, but it does not make it any easier.  Please give her our deepest sympathies.  We may be back in August and can talk then, I was upset that we did not get a chance to say goodbye to Les when we left.  Joey"
221033,Rich Clemens,2008-06-29 18:09:00,3131,"Allow Patsy and I to extend our deepest sympathy in the passing of Leslie's mom.  I can imagine the trips to Timmins were long and tiring, but greatly appreciated.  Must have been quite hectic in these last days with everyone in camp and the trips to the hospital.   An amazing and wonderful lady Leslie is.   Again, our heart filled sympathy to your family."
