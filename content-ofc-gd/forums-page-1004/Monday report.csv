When we hit the water around 6:30 , heavy clouds started rolling in from the north and after about half an hour sun has dissapeared.     Bass is open so I've started casting spinnerbait. After few casts I got something, but small - 10"" crappie Changed to 3"" ""five of diamonds"", five min later another 10"" crappie Now HJ12, Finally something bigger - 23-25"" pike, little bit later another one same size and then..... you've guessed - 10"" crappie  Next catch few min later make me laugh. 6"" crappie on HJ12, and this was an ""acrobat"" - back treble in the mouth, front one embeded in tail  . I was soooo surprised that I've forgot about picture. Water was calm, so I've started tossing spook. 20 min and nothing. Decided to change lure again, when the spook was about 10 yards from the boat, I've started reeling in, and what do you know, this chunky bass hit it 3' from the boat (21""/3lb 9oz)  New techniques for the spook - reel it fast in straight line  Let's try for walleye. Juicy worm on inline spinner. They did not cooperate, but yhis one did (30""/5lb 7oz)   We've drifted to the shore to streach legs little bit, but we had to leave in a hurry because of this   Later we've landed few more pikes and LMB, but small ones.  Traditionaly two pikes and crappies as a reward for their effort were invited for fish fry contest  "

Thanks for sharing.  oh and ""New techniques for the spook - reel it fast in straight line"" works also very well for Musky! Just pause it for a bit when you reach near the boat."
