222760,anders,2008-07-03 18:56:00,1168,"I use two 8lb balls in my boat. THey will do a good job and not sway to far up when trolling.  As for bait, i will let others help you in that department, as i am 10 hours away from there and never fished that area before.  As for trolling...if you can dont troll in  straight line...zig zaging will hit more fish"
222762,SlowPoke,2008-07-03 19:00:00,2984,"8lb ball will be sufficiant, 10-12lb balls track deeper. I usually run a heavier ball but I have electric riggers. Flasher and fly is a great option Flasher and cut meat Lyman's or J-Plugs J11 or J13 Jointed Rapala Have fun and be careful!"
222780,LeXXington,2008-07-03 19:38:00,1928,"Stick with the 8lb,  big balls (insert giggle here) are nice but on a manuel it gets tough reeling them in.  With out a sounder it will be really hard to fish as you don't know what depth you are in or what depth the fish are holding at. Get the sounder before heading out  spoons, plugs, spin doctors they all work well.. some days its one over the other,  Play safe have fun"
222809,medmart,2008-07-03 20:58:00,587,Hey New Angler you should try a dipsy diver with a spin doctor and cut bait that worked out there 2 weeks a go get your self a vhf radio and if you have time you should go over to tight lines fishing store there you can get anything you want check this web site out WWW.SPOONPULLERS.COM Rob
