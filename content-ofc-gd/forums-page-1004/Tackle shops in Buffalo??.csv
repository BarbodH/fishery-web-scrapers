Thanks"
222755,Sketty55,2008-07-03 18:41:00,52,My wife always wants to go to Buffalo and I end up trying to sneak away to find some new gear. I haven't seen much....but Dick's Sporting Goods usually has some good sales (Walden Galleria Mall). I usually pick up a couple packs of senko's.....$5.99 at regular price. Check their online flyer for weekly sale items. I'm waiting for the BPS to open sometime in the next year or two (I hope).

Dicks is a bit further of a ride for the galleria location (they have the most stuff ) but there are other locations closer. But less selection as i said. Those are the big box stores.......theres some local places obviously but at the moment, the only ones i can think of are a bit of a drive"
