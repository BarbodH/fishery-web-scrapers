Started at 80"" and worked my way out too 150 then back and forth, not too many hooks around yet but did have a large on follow my bait for a while.  It was the first time that I really got too see one follow the boat on the sounder. I watched the big hook at 100' come crusing up too my bait at 60' stay there for about 1 min then head back to the deep. Followed the boat like jaws  right behind the boat so the finder saw the entire thing.  I did manage to pick up these 2 and a few knock offs,       Its still early but lots of bait clouds out there,  Going to be a good Salmon year"

222750,Reef Runner,2008-07-03 18:30:00,981,Good job Lexx!  That report reminds me a couple years back trolling for lakers on Kippawa in QC.  Would see the laker on our portable humminbird coming up from the depths to hit our gangtroll.  It was so cool and you could predict when you'd get a fish on.  Anyway sounds like a great day on the water!
