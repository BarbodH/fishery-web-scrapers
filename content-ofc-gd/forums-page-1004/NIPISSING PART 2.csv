Lots of wind and rain.  skies did clear but cold front shut the fishing right down.  I through everything in my box at them and didnt get a bite for hours at a time.  Hear is  pic from sunday evening.    monday morning i was on the lake by 500am, it was chilly but looked like the rain would hold off.  Well it did for most of nipisisng lol not for the south bay where i was fishing.  It rained on and off all morning.  It was weird though.  everytime it rained i would get into fish.  then not a bite when it stopped.  I managed to get into some decent 1 1/2 to 2 pounders though.        Over all it was a great weekend.  This weeknd im heading to Magnetawan with my wife camping for a few days.  Then we are back in north bay for the week and I will be fishing everyday on nipissing for sure!  Cheers!"
222505,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-07-03 10:57:00,0,Nipissing has an amazing smallie fishery and the best bait to catch them on? A white grub(especially if there is a small spinner attached to the jig head)! Thanks for sharing.
