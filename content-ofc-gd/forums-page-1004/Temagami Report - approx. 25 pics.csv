208776,Clampet,2008-05-30 22:26:00,1947,"Dude! Awesome report! Quite the adventure just getting there eh? Especially by canoe, you have to call the shots with high winds.  Nice campfire.  Nice hat too."
208779,bassman,2008-05-30 22:31:00,384,Did the ring add any more action to the lure?
208805,moose,2008-05-30 23:32:00,266,"hey paul thats were jerry and keiths gang used to hunt kokoko and the swedes whoever got in their first now i think its deepwater that goes in their, u picke d agood time of yr to be their as the summer wheres on more people on kokoko"
208822,johnnyb,2008-05-31 00:44:00,3413,"Wow...thanks for all the great feedback, folks!  I really do get out to do more fishing as a result of this board, and the whole time, I was mentally writing the report as I was snapping pics.  I'm glad it's getting a few reads TWILIGHT -- Jessy is on the board, as ""Laker Jessy""...just doesn't get onto the site as much as me... BASSMAN -- I really was tempted to put it on her line without her knowing....but if she got a snag....that would have been a COLD swim! GERRIT -- no comment FANG! -- we did move one of those boats outta the way and haul it up on shore....the other one was just too swamped to move.  We hit Ferrim with the group of guys from Aurora/Newmarket....but nobody caught a thing.  Think the water was just a bit on the chilly side still.  And yes, those back lakes are getting extra attention next time, when we can schedule things a bit better.  Thanks again for the map!!! CLAMP-IT -- It is pretty tough to go fishing without that hat"
208856,Moosebunk,2008-05-31 02:05:00,3970,"Caught this earlier.  Great report.  Nice to spend quality time with your girl, even better in a great area like Temagami."

Crappy day so we headed for Liskeard for flooring. Surprised you didn't take a shot through our window of our liquor selection on the table and the mess associated with the reno going on! Call next time ya silly bugger!  Looks like you had a great time and got into some good fish!

208695,johnnyb,2008-05-30 18:32:00,3413," Nope!  I asked her what she though when she saw the lure and her reply was "" He better not be taking that lure back!""  So yer gonna have to ask her for it"
208698,b2kptbo,2008-05-30 18:38:00,1505,Beauty report and congrats...
208709,Fang,2008-05-30 18:59:00,1330,"Looks like a great trip JB.  Looks like my other buddies boat in Kokoko needs some bailing!!  Makes me almost ""homesick"" for Temagami. Was talking to Rick (owner of Wishin.....) last night and he mentioned he saw your canoe on the lake. His group was fishing our ""The Magic Tree"" spot and caught all their fish and a whack more that weekend jigging /casting in 8 ft of water. Another group went into Ferrin Lake off Kokoko and really did well on pike.  Oh well have to wait for July to get up there.  That beaver pond you hiked into looks very familiar. Think I sat in there a few years ago hunting moose.  Glad you enjoyed. Not too many spots like it. If you head back up again give me a shout. You can travel in through Kokoko bay and halfway up there's a speckle lake on a portage thats pretty neat."
