Caught a whole bunch of rock bass, caught my first largemouth and my first perch. We landed a ton of jumbos. Only got one pic tho of my bass on cpguy29's camera. Will post it later.  Thanks cpguy29 for a great day out. Look forward to it again."

221953,cpguy29,2008-07-02 00:45:00,148,"It was a fun day, but some tough fishing. We maybe managed to get 10 bass to the boat, but the perch and rockbass kept us busy. Had one hit from a small muskie too. Great company, will have to do it again sometime.  "
