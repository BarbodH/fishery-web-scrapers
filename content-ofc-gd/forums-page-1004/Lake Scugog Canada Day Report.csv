222119,ecmilley,2008-07-02 14:04:00,2163,"Nice report Cliff as for the bass-pro guy he should have apoligized for hitting the boat, but in the excitement of the weekend with opener some tournys ect may have made him temporarily rude, I deal with all sorts of tourny boats on sturgeon lake all summer long and have never ever run into a rude pro on the water, (it happens i am sure but have never seen  it) there always friendly and chatty. just look at the pros on this board always willing to answer Q's and chat, like slayingm, pete mania. dave mercer are just a few that come to mind"
222165,ccmtcanada,2008-07-02 16:45:00,7971,Ernie...I'm sure what happened was just an isolated occurence and I love reading the tips and reports that the pros on this board post.  I think it's really cool that pros frequent our board...it speaks volumes to OFC!
222168,LeXXington,2008-07-02 16:52:00,1928,"Nice report cliff,  For the bass guy, sometimes not only pro guys forget manners.   I think it was just rude manners at the lauch ramp.  Happens all the time,"
222200,TOM C,2008-07-02 18:38:00,76,"For something that I am sure was not intentional, to post a guys pictures and sponsors seems to be way over the top, thats how some of these guys make their livings and for someone to try and cause them harm because their boat swung out on a dock.  And greencoach as always your wisdom and grasp of the english language are great, with 5,867 posts and a 3rd of them telling someone they are an jerk I feel kinda warm all over that you would take the time to grace one of my posts with your time, after all it does say your a FISHING GOD, but like the Woman Bassmaster who a couple of weeks ago wouldnt take the time for you to teach her how to catch fish next to a dam,LOL, I to feel at this time have nothing to learn but if ever the need ariases I will ask, but please stay at your post, so you can inform us all when the next jerk (OTHER THAN ME) shows up, or better yet refer to POST5 of this thread AND TAKE ANOTHER LOOK IN THAT MAGIC MIRROR OF YOURS"
222202,Greencoachdog,2008-07-02 18:42:00,8163,  You say the sweetest things Tom!!!
222205,Bitsmith2k,2008-07-02 18:52:00,396, might be a good idea to proof read something like that before questioning someone elses grasp of the language..
222207,TOM C,2008-07-02 19:00:00,76,Figuratively not Literally  but hey chalk another one up to the spelling cops.
222209,Puckhead,2008-07-02 19:09:00,377," Sorry bud, you are way off base.  The reason why he is paid by those sponsers is for exposure.  The better you do, the more exposure you get, the more money you get.  Exposure comes from tourney's AND recreational coverage, the boat launch being a significant part of recreational coverage.  When you are wearing your sponsored gear,etc., you better act in the best interest of your sponsor(s).  If you act like an jerk off, then you deserve to get called on it.  A big part of making that living is putting yourself out there for all to see (as it were) - behave accordingly.  If he came over and apologized and was nice, like any decent angler would do, this post wouldn't be here, now would it?  Your argument is nonsense."
222212,solopaddler,2008-07-02 19:21:00,8605,Uhhh....nice bass Cliff!!
222213,ccmtcanada,2008-07-02 19:22:00,7971, LOL....thanks bud.
222214,Greencoachdog,2008-07-02 19:29:00,8163,
222215,Roy,2008-07-02 19:29:00,13728," Ain't noone ever said that to ME, Mike. I feel so...inadequate."
222223,solopaddler,2008-07-02 19:49:00,8605," Okay okay, nice bass Roy!    (happy now?  )"
222224,TOM C,2008-07-02 19:50:00,76,"Puckhead I am still not sure where this guy did someone so much harm that he should be roasted on a public form, but I guess your right because he is a pro he some how gave up his right to make human errors, and the way I read the original post it wasnt the boat owner who made the comment that seemed to have bothered the ones making the post.  So I apologize for seeing this from the pros side, and as many of the others I fish with and against we will wait patentialy well others that dont launch as often as we do fumble around and back in the launch 7 or 8 times and ram our boats because their not sure how to stop the boat from going forward, untie their boats while at the ramp rather than before they get to the ramp, and do this full well knowing that if we make the same human errors and momantary lapses in judgement and dont say what people want us to say we run the risk of being ridiculed on public forms such as this one by folks that have all the right answers and know all the right things to do, but I sure hope pros can see past all this and still put up prize packages and take the time to speak to people at launches.  I am done, nothing more can come of my time on OFC.  And if the spelling isnt right, thats why I dont teach spelling in school   P.S. the guy was there for the Fish T.V. Celebrity Show down which is a fantastic event for kids to come down and see their favorite sports stars and get autographs and such, but hey shame on Darrin for coming all the way to help out and for getting in the way.   And ya greencoach you win I will not post on OFC again and I hope others follow suite, and the good folks here like the way you treat people, because I know of no PRO that would disrespect people near as much as you do, but hey they seem to like that you rarely have any thing positive to say"
222227,Greencoachdog,2008-07-02 19:58:00,8163,  *sniff*... does this mean you're not going to abuse me anymore???  *sniff*
222231,ozaibak1,2008-07-02 20:11:00,401,"Just wanna put in my 2 cents. If someone bumps into you or something that belongs to you, possibly causing damage, and not apologizing, they are being an excellent person. Not saying I've never done it, but thats just how it is. If you wanna dispute that, you must like to argue. Seems like most ppl on this board like arguing about something, why can't we all get along."
222232,ozaibak1,2008-07-02 20:12:00,401,ok  -hole should replace 'excellent person' in my last post... stupid censors...
222233,misfish,2008-07-02 20:12:00,29133,"Cliff nice bass bud and nice to se the family getting out together. As for the other,well it does happen, but the boat should of been tied better. Thats all I got to say about that."
222239,irishfield,2008-07-02 20:55:00,26272,Hey the magic trio got out again... that's all that matters. As for the boat banger...well I saw a LOT worse goin on at the Lakair docks and lips where kept tight.....
222256,Sinker,2008-07-02 22:12:00,8692,"Well, it looks like ya's had a good day Cliff and Carole. The Unbrella is a great tool to keep the kids comfy....it works great!!  The more times you launch, the more you learn. Sometimes stuff happens...don't let it get to ya.....life goes on!  Sinker"
222262,Gerritt,2008-07-02 22:22:00,6129,"Yup Sinker has it right.... and cry babies leave a great fishing forum over a bit of text...  Making the ""pros"" look even better there TomC...  Good luck to you.  G"
222272,Mike01,2008-07-02 22:43:00,378,"wow...second from the top when you put it in google.  I have fished with quite a few tourney pro's both from the US and Canada.  Every one of them has gone out their way to be helpful.  I'm sure even Darrin is a nice guy, must have just been an off day.  However that doesn't excuse the fact that he didn't secure his boat properly."
222274,Cookslav,2008-07-02 22:48:00,1457,"Thats a nice way to spend Canada fer sure! Decent bass to boot, and I bet she was a blast to haul out of the Bog...all that weed makes for some great Bulldog'n eh?  As for the Pro element to all this...Who cares? An  is an , it don't matter how many stripes he has, or what color they are. If the  is willing to put his name on his boat that is his own liability put out there on a plate for all to see. If he's gonna be rude, well....We reap what we sew folks. Perhaps if he catches wind of this little skermish then maybe he'll pop in and say sorry, or at the very least he'll think twice about his conduct out there next time....heck even I learned somthing by this!  I'll make sure to NEVER put my name on my boat"
222278,Roy,2008-07-02 22:52:00,13728,"I'm  absolutely certain that this is not the direction that Cliff and Carole wanted this thread to go when they posted their Canada Day report so we'll lock it, perhaps saving a few more from embarrassment."
222092,TOM C,2008-07-02 12:28:00,76,"Funny how petty some people can get, calling tournament anglers aholes, and how they have no respect, and how they bully all you out of your spots, and how they hurt the resourses, non of they people that seem to do all the crap flinging even have a freakin clue, as to how the top pros behave on or off the water, all of the top run series in Canada have code of ethics, that must be followed, and they are, if asked to move from a dock they will, they know and practice boat launch protical, they regularly help with fish surveys and tagging, they practice catch and release. How many of you that seem to want to call them aholes can say they do any of these things. Jealiousy is a terrible thing.  And being at a boat launch at least 200 times a year, the funny thing about your story and your pictures is, you said he arrived at the launch before you( and there is no 10k zone so passing is allowed) but your 1 pics shows that you had at least 100 feet of open dock ahead of this boat but for some reason decided to park right up against this boat, when you clearly had enough open dock to get 5 boat lenghts away. Maybe when one of the larger series runs a tournament on a lake close, go down and watch how 100 boats unload and load with not any where near the trouble that you had with 2 boats at a launch."
222096,ccmtcanada,2008-07-02 12:42:00,7971," I didn't care that he passed me on the way in...my report said that...I was in no rush.  There were boats in front of him when we docked, so I took my place in line....and we were at the end of the dock.  Even if there was space in front, would it not be taken that I was trying to exit the water out of order?  The other boats were gone by the time I came back.  I know he had no intention of waiting either because I heard him say ""It's my own fault, I got caught chatting or I'd be out of the water already"".  I'm not in any way jealous of any tournament angler either...or any angler period and I don't remember anyone saying anything about bullying out of spots or hurting resources.  Anyhow, what's done is done....I wasn't that upset....the other boaters who were there were the ones who were really ticked off."
222098,mattyk,2008-07-02 13:03:00,2110,thanks for the report. There are always a few bozos around.
222100,fishinggeek,2008-07-02 13:12:00,325,"Yeah I'm not sure about jealousy either.  I've never fished one, but seen it on the tube, and it's not something I personally want to try.  I'm sure for the most part they're good folks, but bad apples are in every bunch.  Unfortunately, ccmt seemed to have found a rotten one.  What I don't like about them is they'll wizz by you at warp speed while I'm fishing, which is fine as no one owns the waterways.  But when I go by them while they're in a tourney, they get all up in a fuss sometimes, or at least it seems that way to me."
222103,Greencoachdog,2008-07-02 13:22:00,8163,"  I rest my case on Bass Tourney   -holes... you just proved my point!  Had this Bozo been the ""Ethical Angler"" you speak of, he'd have gone straight to his truck and trailer and removed his boat in a quick and timley manner instead of tieing valuable dock space while he shot the Bull with his boyfriends."
222115,Joey,2008-07-02 13:52:00,9122,"Great report Cliff.  It was a beautiful day to get out on the water.  I feel your daughter's pain.  Last week there were a few times out on the boat I was very tempted to jump in the waters with them there muskies and pike on Muskrat Bay     A few dips of my hat  in the water and getting my shirt wet helped.  Sorry to hear about the docking incident.  I think an apology would have been nice, but since you didn't get one, well....... speaks volumns doesn't it.  Joey"
222116,Bly,2008-07-02 14:01:00,1556,"  Morning Tom  I thank you for comments.  I would like to clear up a few things.  Neither Ccmt or I referred to this Angler by an inappropriate name, challenge his ethics or comment on him as a person in any fashion.  You may have not been referring to us with your comments however the use of ""you and ""your"" throughout the post does seem to imply that.  Our boat was positioned behind his because we arrived only a moment after him.  We pulled in BEHIND him with the intention of waiting our turn.  There was no reason to pull ahead of him and even IF we thought there was need to pull ahead of him, there were other watercraft in front of him at the time we all arrived. He was still in his boat as we were tying up our lines, we had no way of knowing that his boat was going to swing out.  When his boat first began to swing out from the dock, a few bystanders (myself included) were more concerned that the boat had come loose and was going to float away.   I suppose I could have started my boat, untied the lines and attempted to move our boat but I was busy trying to decide if there was a need to assist this boat from floating away.  Again, a bystander noticed that the boat was secured with whatever that bar is called and we realized that it was not going to drift away from the dock entirely but by then it had swung a 180 into our boat.   I was doing my best to keep the boats apart while attempting to release our bowline in preparation of moving our boat....during the process, I could hear one of the anglers rewmen  (guessing this as he was wearing the same jersey and helping) and a bystander discussing the situation.   Quick version..the crewman expressed that everything was just fine and had no worries about the boats hitting, that is what the bumpers were for.  I decided to snap a few pictures, as yes, I was annoyed and the pictures helped me laugh about it.  I have never commented negatively in reference to tournament anglers, I personally do not have any issues with them as a group, I respect their abilities and contributions to the sport.  I have watched the loading and unloading of the tourney boats on previous occasions...it is impressive. I wish the guy no ill will and there is not, nor was there ever any intention of contacting anyone regarding the matter to make trouble for him.   Ccmt overheard him say ""It's my own fault, I got caught chatting or I'd be out of the water already"", would have been nice if that had been said to us rather than what we did hear regarding his boat hitting ours  (""that is what bumpers are for"").  The incident would have been forgotten  I have learned a few things from this experience and for that I thank him.  Have a great day Tom."
