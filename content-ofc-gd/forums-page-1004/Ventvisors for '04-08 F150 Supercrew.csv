The ones I pulled off are still fine, but they don't have the adhesive tape on them anymore.  (Spent 2 hours scarping/cleaning it off the paint last night   )  So I have the 2 rear visors and the passenger side front visor to whoever wants them.  I think you can buy the double-sided 3M tape to use with them at Canadian Tire...  Hopefully someone who has a busted one can take advantage of this offer.

Worth every penny when it,s a 3M product. The back ones,are they for flip out side windows or roll down? I could use them if they are for a flip out."
