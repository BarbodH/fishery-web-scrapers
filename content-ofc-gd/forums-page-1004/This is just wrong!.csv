222046,irishfield,2008-07-02 05:10:00,26272,Thorpe.... pants and a shirt for when Dano and I arrive.. Okay?
220242,Roy,2008-06-27 11:09:00,13728,"Lotsa folks think that muskie fishing is a serious sport. Well I got news for you. Marc Thorpe, John Gillespie, Pete Maina and Pete's dad ""Tex"" are filming this week. Those guys have fun on the water. So much fun in fact that they try to never have to get off the water. They're filming for a few days this week.  This is Pete's newest invention.    And Marc, well, what can I say about Marc....direct from the Highlands of Quebec...    But, with all the shenanigans going on out there, they still produce more than anyone I've ever seen.    Those shows will surely be required viewing this winter. Certainly good for a belly laugh and maybe even a few muskie tips. I might be lucky enough to hook up with them this weekend...now where did I put my dwarf suit???"
220249,tjsa,2008-06-27 11:35:00,1578,"Marc has some pretty smoking gams there, a bit of suntanning needed maybe, but those socks and shoes gotta go, don't fit with the rest of the outfit. He should have had the high laced, tasseled footwear on to complete the outfit properly.  No comment on Pete's ""wardrobe accessory""!!!!!!!!!!!.....................bite's tongue............... HARD.   ""dwarf suit""????????????  Too bad, I will probably not be able to see those episodes, I don't think I can subscribe to it through my local cable supplier, at least not without doubling my existing cable bill."
220251,motv8tr,2008-06-27 11:51:00,2587,"I agree with Tom, those socks and shoes gotta go....as for Pete.....  Maureen"
220258,Greencoachdog,2008-06-27 12:02:00,8163,Nice fish!  It doesn't look like they're letting the rain stop them!
220272,largemouth,2008-06-27 12:32:00,112,funny what people do once the fame goes to their heads.
220297,Roy,2008-06-27 13:27:00,13728,"They're just doing their work and having a good time doing it, Largemouth. They're also very nice people who support and sponsor this site as well. They are also friends of mine."
220302,BillM,2008-06-27 13:37:00,17367," When you are #1 at what you do, you can act any way you want."
220305,Greencoachdog,2008-06-27 13:41:00,8163,I just hope noone drops a Toonie on the deck!
220306,Reef Runner,2008-06-27 13:42:00,981,"Marc really, really need to start wearin some shorts?  The kilt doesn't allow him to tan those gams. lol.  Fishin with those guys, Roy, you might need a jock for yourself.  Goodluck to you if ya get out them, sounds like blast!"
220307,Chris,2008-06-27 13:43:00,405,Nothing shocks me anymore......
220330,tbayboy,2008-06-27 14:28:00,1497,Great to see guys having that much fun and still doing incredibly well with the fish.  I can't imagine how much fun it would be to spend a day on the water with those guys.
220337,Bly,2008-06-27 14:38:00,1556,WOO HOO!!!  A man in a kilt fishing and catching musky    Does life get any better than that??  Think I will withhold my thoughts on the plastic pants lol   Thanks for sharing those Roy and of course Marc and Pete
220340,largemouth,2008-06-27 14:44:00,112, I respect your right to an opinion.........but it doesn't change mine.
220359,Guest gbfisher,2008-06-27 15:38:00,0,HA HA HA HA   There'd be no plank walking for you there Mark with a get up like that. At least not the kinda plank walkin we discussed...  ..........

220360,Spiel,2008-06-27 15:42:00,9065," ....I've done plenty of corny stuff when in the boat and if fact out of the boat, plenty of it captured on film too, and fame had nothing to do with it! Just having fun that's all. Wouldn't life be a giggle if we never allowed ourselves to be foolish, ever! *yawn*"
