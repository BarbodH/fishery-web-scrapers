Someone left the tree lights on, so just like Cindylou from hooville, she went to the living room and seen all the presents.  We told here they will be there when we ALL wake up.  I can remember when it was I, waiting for the kids to wake up to see all the gifts. One year I slept on the couch to catch my oldest sons reaction to his new goalie pads. I did not want to miss that. And I didnt.  We had the 4 little darlings up at 6 am. After all it takes 3 hours to get through everything. The wee ones don't know how to rip and tear yet  LOL Bruce. We let her open all of ours. It was like watching the tazmania devil. LOL  You mean that's not you that I just noticed doing the solidified h2o piscatorial thing? Merry merry & happy happy B!  Michael  I thought about it, but I would be in the out house, not the dog house.   Did not you got up that early Brian unless you where Fishing... Merry Christmas buddy  Thank you Kelvin. Same to you bud.   Amazing camera, waterproof out of box, very stable footage and voice controlled. Got mine this fall  Merry Christmas  Got it all charged up Dave. Give it a go later today.
