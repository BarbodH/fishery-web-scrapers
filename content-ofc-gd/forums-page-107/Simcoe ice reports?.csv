989754,G.mech,2017-01-01 15:51:00,830,"There are reports on the Lake Simcoe board but they're all bad.....poor ice now, warm temps & windy forecast makes for a bit longer of a wait I'm afraid.  The latest one says there is some ice from Beaverton out to Thorah Island but it's sketchy with open water beyond that."
