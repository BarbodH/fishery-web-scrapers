989311,lew,2016-12-22 23:50:00,12766,"Every winter I keep a trough full of a mixture of corn, oats and molasses in the back yard for the deer and usually have about a dozen deer a day stop by for something to eat.  Mostly females, some with young ones, but I seldom see any males until this year and in just the last couple days I've had 5 different males show up and it sure is impressive to watch these big magnificent bucks up close.  None of these pictures are very good and I'm thinking it's time for a new camera but you can get an idea of what I get to watch every day.  They range from a 4 pointer, a 6, a 7, an 8 pointer who lost one antler 2 days ago right up to one that was here twice today and my best guess it has somewhere around 12 to 13 points from what I could see thru the binoculars.  These are all different deer in my yard from the last couple days.    The 8 pointer with a full rack    Same critter with one side missing        And the last one with a HUGE rack    "

989314,GBW,2016-12-23 00:10:00,8460,Nice pic's Lew and Id give you my old digital camera free if it's better than yours just so you can post more pics. It's a Kodak easyshare C743
989318,Cast-Away,2016-12-23 01:27:00,790,"What a cool hobby Lew and a cool thing to do for nature!  My late Father, used to love feeding the birds and particularly the Chickadees because they were so friendly and would always take food from your hand. Well that tradition carried on with me although I don't try to hand feed them."
989325,LeXXington,2016-12-23 02:47:00,1928,Nice pic's there Lew  Since your not spending your money on fishing..     A nice camera set up might be the way to go.  Point and click's are nice but a good camera with a great lens can make it an amazing picture
989345,lew,2016-12-23 08:21:00,12766,"Thanks boys, I may look into another camera this winter."
989347,wormdunker,2016-12-23 09:52:00,1711,Awesome pix Lew!  Nice to have them come in that close.  Thanx
989350,Beans,2016-12-23 13:06:00,3339,Nice shots Lew...We don't get as many deer since the guy up the road stopped feeding them (he found out that he could be held responsible if one of them got hit on the road)...We were asked not to feed the birds until the bears were in hibernation...?
989351,NAW,2016-12-23 13:20:00,4022,That's awesome Lew!  I have them in my backyard in the winter.  But no big bucks like that.  That's wild!
989352,Dara,2016-12-23 14:14:00,3052,Thats pretty neat Lew. They will all lose their head gear in the next little bit I guess.  Here are a couple I took at a spot we stop for lunch at while snowmobiling.     
989354,davey buoy,2016-12-23 14:16:00,5505,"Lew,great pics,a trail cam close to the feeding station would be awesome !!!!!!"
989357,lew,2016-12-23 15:09:00,12766,"Thanks guys, good to hear everybody likes seeing deer and Dara, that's a couple great pics of a lot of deer. Most I've had in the yard at one time was 17.  I've also thought of the trail cam.  Here's a favorite picture I took a couple years ago.  That's a big ole Tom turkey that took up residence in my yard for the whole winter once he found out there was a constant food supply and he didn't care how many deer were already at the trough, he'd just muscle his way in between everybody and gorge himself. Best part was watching the deer move over for him and If he could'nt push his way thru the crowd he'd jump right up into the trough LOL  "
989360,manitoubass2,2016-12-23 15:55:00,11391,Hahahaha last pic is epic!!!  Nice shots lew! Talk about great scenery in your own back yard!!!!
989362,OhioFisherman,2016-12-23 17:03:00,6623,"Great pictures! I used to see the area herd in the field across the road from me, then they built homes there and the herd moved."
989373,Sandbag,2016-12-23 21:14:00,533,I could sit and watch that all day Lew.  Very cool pictures.  Cheers  Craig
989388,captpierre,2016-12-24 00:36:00,2521,Hey Lew. Grains like corn and oats are mainly carbs and not very nutritious for the deer if they are eating a lot of it. You might consider a dairy ration (for cows) that includes some protein ( soy) and vitamins and minerals. Costs more but more useful to the deer. Especially pregnant does. I know you like to do things right. Merry Christmas
