989102,glen,2016-12-19 21:09:00,2641,How much do I get for breathing the bad air.
989117,BillM,2016-12-19 23:44:00,17367,"How much do I get for breathing the bad air.  You've been breathing it long before VW diesels hit the road, lol.  I have no idea what my parents will be getting.  Don't know if they plan on giving the car back either."
989118,misfish,2016-12-19 23:48:00,29133,"From what I heard, it still needs approved. The settlement that is."
989131,John,2016-12-20 01:56:00,2956,Still 3-6 months away from approval and sign off...
989133,dave524,2016-12-20 02:52:00,4508,"Why would they get a settlement , they made out like bandits cause they got better mileage than they should have ?"
989142,glen,2016-12-20 04:04:00,2641,Everyone breathed the bad air coming from cars that didn't meet the regs.  I'll take cash.
989145,dave524,2016-12-20 12:14:00,4508,"Everyone breathed the bad air coming from cars that didn't meet the regs.  I'll take cash. My point , EVERYONE breathed the air so why compensate the owners, they already got their bonus through better mileage through fraud on the part of VW ."
989150,BillM,2016-12-20 13:43:00,17367,"My point , EVERYONE breathed the air so why compensate the owners, they already got their bonus through better mileage through fraud on the part of VW .  Same reason why Mazda owners were offered buybacks on their RX8s due to hp outputs being lower them advertised...   You guys are crazy to think any of these 104,000 vehicles made a measurable impact to air quality, lol."
