988866,captpierre,2016-12-17 01:56:00,2521,Took a run up to the lake to look at things. About 10 inches of snow. Surprised to see the Narrows frozen. She's been cold.
988874,Beans,2016-12-17 14:40:00,3339,How's the lake out front of your place?...hard to tell from our shore...our bay (Taites) and Nogie's Creek Bay are frozen as far as far as the eye can see...
988921,captpierre,2016-12-17 22:57:00,2521,Frozen too Beans. Some dark gray ice over the shoal. Likely current keeping it thin.
988924,Beans,2016-12-17 23:42:00,3339,Ya...that makes sense...
988928,Old Ironmaker,2016-12-18 00:17:00,8243,"At least 100' feet of pack ice here on Erie out front, or back depending. It looks good so far for Fish Farmer."
988951,fisherman7,2016-12-18 13:27:00,325,I'm on the secondary channel on Buckhorn Lake. Looks like there's some melting going on. I wonder if they've finally opened the dam?
