989251,PBenson,2016-12-21 23:30:00,154,"We had an incredible week in Florida, this is just one of three videos ill be releasing of the action. On this night we had 8 runs (where the shark picks up your bait) and landed 5 blacktip sharks. It's mind-blowing how many of them there are out there at certain times of the year. My guess is they were migrating south in search of warmer waters. Check it out!  "
989272,smitty55,2016-12-22 02:58:00,928,Pretty cool. Must be lots of fun. Well except maybe not so much for carrying the bait out with the wrong wind. Tks for sharing. Looked like a big Penn on that second shark. What size reels do you need to use?  Cheers
989274,NAW,2016-12-22 03:39:00,4022,"It's a coincidence,because I watched this video yesterday.     And then saw this report today!  Great video!  Scares the heck out of me though!  I find it hard enough pulling a pike through a hole in the ice!!  Let alone a dam SHARK!!"

Looked like a big Penn on that second shark. What size reels do you need to use?  Cheers   Depends on the sharks you're targeting but anything from an 8000 sized spinning reel to a 80w conventional. The reel in the video was a 50w.

989289,Tjames09,2016-12-22 14:04:00,664,"Cool, didn't even know you could fish for sharks. Thought they would have been protected somehow. Is it strictly C&R?"
989290,PBenson,2016-12-22 14:06:00,154,"Depends on the species, but but these blacktips aren't protected, although all of my fishing is catch and release."
