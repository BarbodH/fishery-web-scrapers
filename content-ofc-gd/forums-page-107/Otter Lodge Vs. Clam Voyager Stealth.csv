I'm trying to get my hands on an Otter XT Lodge but it seems like they are next to impossible to come by in SW Ontario. EVERYONE is sold out, or does not have pricing yet! ( Middle of Dec. with no pricing ?!?! SMH )  I can get my hands on a full Clam Voyager Stealth package for about the same price as the Otter Lodge from my local tackle shop. But I really had my heart set on an Otter.  Does anyone have an opinion on the quality between the two companies ??? The new poles on the CLams seem rather robust compared to my old Nanook. But I don't know how they compare to the square poles on the otter.  Any help would be great !"
989130,Fisherman,2016-12-20 01:32:00,7201,"Otter by a long mile.  I've had one for a number of years,  nothing broken.  A family member has one he got from me, it's still going  strong.  Never had an issue with the square poles."

989160,limeyangler,2016-12-20 14:58:00,5204,"Cant speak for the Clam products, but the Otter sleds are pretty awesome. Owned 2 now, both excellent, especially the quality and build of the actual sled. I found the other brands to be to shallow."
989164,Sinker,2016-12-20 16:04:00,8692,"Have you tried Gagnon sports? They usually have a good selection, but I haven't been in there for a while. They are great huts, but nothing wrong with the clam either IMO. I have a clam that I've had for at least 10 years and no issues. It shows wear, but sheesh, its been beat on for 10 yrs LOL  S."

989223,Sinker,2016-12-21 20:52:00,8692,"I bet you get more than 5 yrs.  My next one to buy will be an otter, but i have 5 huts right now, so I don't really need to blow a grand + on another. They are nice though. 2 of my regular fishin buds have them, and they are sweeeeet! MASSIVE though, and hard to load in the truck!!  S."
