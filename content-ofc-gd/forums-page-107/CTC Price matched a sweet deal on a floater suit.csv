988927,misfish,2016-12-18 00:15:00,29133,Yup  Your answer is in the pic.
988963,captpierre,2016-12-18 16:40:00,2521,Didn't know CTC price matches
988974,PUMP KNOWS,2016-12-18 17:44:00,937,^^^ They do but some give a hard time when price matching.  They give excuses how they never heard of a certain store even if you supply the website you want to price match with.  The worse are the ones who don't know how to run a computer at the customer service desk.
989009,leaf4,2016-12-18 21:27:00,2466,"You have to supply them with the paper flyer, when I bought my Bradley smoker it was on sale at princess auto for 299 or something like that, I ended up getting 10% back in CT money which gave me $30 to put towards more smoker bisquettes"
988880,misfish,2016-12-17 16:48:00,29133,"Been looking for a new or even a used 2 piece floater suit. Been taking a few to many risks not having one the last two years. I have the Clam suit, but thats not a floatation suit.  Been wanting the Artic Armour suit ever since my buddy Terry had his. Light wieght,and very warm. So he says. Will find out I guess.  So anyhoo, CTC has had these suits,but just crazy prices. Well to me they were anyways. ( All the floater suits these days seem to have sky rocketed in price )        Been doing some online price searching and came across one that had a good price for the suit. I start thinking if CTC will price match. So print off the site info.         Went in today , asked for the store manager. She showed up, showed here the print off. Just take that and the suit up to the front counter and they will take care of you sir.  So I do as she says, and I was out the door in 10 minutes with a price matched purchase, and a floater suit.  BRING ON THE ICE"
988881,G.mech,2016-12-17 16:54:00,830,"Maybe I'm missing something but the internet price was higher than CTC's tag wasn't it??  Edit, oh never mind.....The bib was 299 and so was the jacket but you got the whole suit for 319.  Man I am thick sometimes."
988882,cheaptackle,2016-12-17 16:57:00,849,They used to give 10 bux in CT cash when they price matched - didja get that Brian?  Michael
988883,manitoubass2,2016-12-17 16:58:00,11391,Nice score! You wont regret it!  I highly recommend heading to a local pool to taker for a swim.  Its very important to learn to swim and flip over BEFORE you have to do it in an emergency situation!

988893,misfish,2016-12-17 17:35:00,29133,"They look identical, but only one floats...  And ive seen terrys test drive  The tags on the suit show it,s a floater."
988894,Terry,2016-12-17 17:40:00,14456,i cant see any difference on their website
988895,misfish,2016-12-17 17:50:00,29133,"Arctic Armor Suits, Arctic Armor Pro Suits, and Arctic Armor Plus Suits feature 3 layers of I.D.I Gear's exclusive thermal insulator INSULTEX™. One layer of INSULTEX protects a person to sub-zero temperatures. Multiple layers of INSULTEX provide practically unlimited levels of insulation. Arctic Armor Suits with INSULTEX are warm, windproof, waterproof, and buoyant – if you go into the water wearing an Arctic Armor Suit you will float!"

988901,Ralph Field,2016-12-17 18:38:00,1018,Doesn't Barrie have sanitation ponds where you could test it and pray it floats?
988903,PUMP KNOWS,2016-12-17 18:48:00,937,Nice pick up!  Mine's not a flotation suit but just a ice suit...
