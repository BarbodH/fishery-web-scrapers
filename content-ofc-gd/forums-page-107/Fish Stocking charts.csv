Checked the fish on-line page aswell and every stocked lake I click on it shows no stocking info or species. Thanks"

I used to be on the list for emailed copies from one CO out of Pembroke every year, but it hasn't been available for two years now. Another cut back lol.  Cheers"

""    ** surplus walleye fry returned to donor source. "" in the footnote  probably not good, looks like they hatched more fry than they had hatchery space for to raise to a stockable size and dumped the excess in town in the river. It does empty into Kashagawigamog after a couple of smaller lakes.  Fingerlings are the preferred stockers."
989422,misfish,2016-12-24 22:21:00,29133,Im surprised they say that they stock a lake north west. I havent noticed a plus in fish or catching on it. Fished it 6 times this year and the fishing was tough. Maybe the hot summer had something to do with it. UNSURE.
