989365,DRIFTER_016,2016-12-23 19:04:00,10439,My local CT has a Helix 7 sonar on sale for a screaming deal. Anyone own one and have any thoughts on it? Was thinking of picking it up to use beside my new Garmin echomap 93 unit.
989367,ecmilley,2016-12-23 19:55:00,2163,Have a 9 its ok but no hds
989368,limeyangler,2016-12-23 20:05:00,5204,"Picked up the Helix 5 ice edition for a screaming deal at CT too, sorry but have not had a chance to use it yet, same unit different size screens, will be able to give a review tomorrow if you can hang on till then. Also have a 9 on the boat, its ok, but pricey if you ask me."
989370,porkpie,2016-12-23 20:41:00,2521,"I bought the same screaming deal in a helix5 to update my ice sonar.  So far, it's screen resolution is great, and functionally it seems pretty much the same as my 385, and my 597 where.  Both of those units where/are excellent by the way, I still have the 385.  If the helix is anything like the other units I've had, you probably won't be disappointed but I couldn't give you an honest review of it yet.!  I know another guy who bought one and I think it was $300 plus tax for sonar/GPS in the 7 size, and that is a screaming deal!"
989372,Bass Tard,2016-12-23 21:11:00,128,"I also bought one, have only taken it out of the box to look at it!  I figured I have until June to figure it out."
989374,DRIFTER_016,2016-12-23 21:27:00,10439,"LOL looks like everyone went to CT today. I picked it up and as it's only a regular sonar it will run full screen as such. I can run my mapping, down scan and side scan on my Garmin unit. For a couple hundred bucks I thought WTH!!!!"
989410,BillM,2016-12-24 14:25:00,17367,For the price I don't think you can beat it.  I still need to replace the 747c on my bow that just up and died this year.  (It's too bad I'm going to have to change the mount now too!)
989411,porkpie,2016-12-24 15:34:00,2521,"Check PM, if you don't want GPS there is a CT with a helix 7 no GPS in stock.  $250."
989428,DRIFTER_016,2016-12-24 23:46:00,10439,"Check PM, if you don't want GPS there is a CT with a helix 7 no GPS in stock. $250.  Yeah, that's the one I got. My Garmin echomap has GPS as well as the ability to create maps on the fly as well as down and side scanning."
989429,misfish,2016-12-24 23:57:00,29133," Yeah, that's the one I got. My Garmin echomap has GPS as well as the ability to create maps on the fly as well as down and side scanning.   Terry and I looked at the Garmins today. I had to tell him to wipe the drool from his face.LOL I just sucked mine back in not too show .LMAO  Those are sweet units."
989440,porkpie,2016-12-25 02:21:00,2521,Garmin has been coming out with some pretty nice stuff.  I almost bought one last go round and ended up with a raymarine instead.  I'd look at them again!
989442,DRIFTER_016,2016-12-25 02:39:00,10439,Been playing with them here in the living room. The Garmin is a pretty sick unit especially for the price when compared to the other brands that can build your own maps with. The built in GPS can pick up a dozen satellites from inside the house!! Just have to wait six more months to get the boat out.
