Any tips from those that have done this appreciated. I plan on replacing the wood as well.  Is regular contact cement the best thing to use?  There's a vinyl on my consoles under the windshield I'd like to replace as well, any thoughts on what to use?  "
989304,wormdunker,2016-12-22 22:13:00,1711,"4 years ago I put a new plywood floor & vinyl in my 14' Lund.  I purchased the vinyl from Home Depot, they have a particular type of glue that is recommended for this type of vinyl.  It has held up to wear & tear very well.  The vinyl I have is the same stuff you see in the newer Lunds."
989305,aplumma,2016-12-22 22:41:00,6896,I used the indoor outdoor carpet glue it has less fumes than contact cement. I made sure I had a good coat of glue on the wood to seal it. I have a Ranger boat and used vinyl on the main floor to make it easy to wash. The casting decks remained carpet because I fish barefoot and it keeps them from getting hot. The vinyl flooring can get pretty hot in the sun but having a place to land the fish without sliming the carpet is well worth it.   Art

989333,jjcanoe,2016-12-23 03:04:00,744,"I did my old Lund a few years ago, replaced the carpet with all vinyl, looked great and was very easy to keep clean.  I used 3M 777 spray on glue. Holds up great on vinyl and would highly recommend it for vinyl, not sure how it would work on carpeting."
989335,tizfun,2016-12-23 03:35:00,292,"3M 777 works great on marine carpeting.. I've done 2 complete boats in the last 3 years..  Stratos 217 walleye boat and just recently Princecraft pro142.... Floor, decks and all the hatch lids.. just take your time.."
989348,G.mech,2016-12-23 11:06:00,830,3M 77 is great for vinyl as others have said. I just did the consoles in mine and it worked great.  Where can you purchase good quality marine carpet?

989359,tizfun,2016-12-23 15:49:00,292,I used Whitby Marine both times... use actual marine carpeting... a little more in price but you get what you pay for..

989366,aplumma,2016-12-23 19:17:00,6896,When choosing your glue make sure you can achieve the temperature needed for it to cure correctly. Make sure that it is compatible with the material you are bonding too. Some glues will not bond to pressure treated plywood correctly. Glues that are not water based will give you lots of VOC fumes that in an inclosed space could harm you.  Art
