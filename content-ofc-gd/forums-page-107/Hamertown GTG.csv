989647,bigugli,2016-12-29 23:15:00,6138,Was good to see the old diehards and share a pint or two.  The crowd just keeps getting smaller every year. Pretty soon  we'll be down to a couple of old timers on a park bench with a brown paper bag

989670,LeXXington,2016-12-30 15:10:00,1928,"Great to see a few old faces and meet some new folks.  Nothing better than getting away from the house and chatting with some great people about fishing, (and the beer, can't forget about the beer )"

Nothing better than getting away from the house and chatting with some great people about fishing, (and the beer, can't forget about the beer )  You definitely caught me by surprise Paul, it was indeed good to talk shop as it were with you over a couple of cold ones."

988953,wormdunker,2016-12-18 15:14:00,1711,I plan to attend.  Is it still the Ale House at 802 Upper Gage?  I don't see a time posted??

989030,Old Ironmaker,2016-12-19 01:01:00,8243,Wormdunker has volunteered to bring some home made Jerky too! I think I'll try his before I ruin a perfectly good roast.
989033,manitoubass2,2016-12-19 01:20:00,11391,Well at least dementia is acceptable at your age...  Enjoy the GTG guys. Sounds like a great time!
989035,Old Ironmaker,2016-12-19 01:33:00,8243,Take a ride Rick. You have plenty of time to get here. Maybe Brian will swing by and pick you up. He knows the way. Wouldn't that be a GTG to remember.
989044,Tom S,2016-12-19 02:37:00,362,"I had been hoping to come and meet some members, but I've got a family event that day. Maybe at the spring swap meet?"
989049,Old Ironmaker,2016-12-19 03:54:00,8243,That's too bad you will miss it Tom. We could have car pooled. I don't live far from Cayuga. We are down at the lake at the end and west of Fisherville road.
989057,manitoubass2,2016-12-19 10:21:00,11391,Wish I could man! Sounds like a blast! One of these years

989635,Loonietoon,2016-12-29 17:00:00,1450,See everyone soon... WINGS....YUM YUM..
987722,Loonietoon,2016-12-02 21:33:00,1450,"No Speil I was talking about the first choice. I was happy it was changed and just wanted everyone to know about Art's tragic death. I got all emotional and it went straight to the keyboard. Sorry Kelvin. I'm all calmed down this glorious morning. I hope to make it on the 29th. I really do not enjoy driving at night now, maybe I can talk one of the lake scallywags here to join me. Just this week and it's only Friday 3 Deer crossed my path. Last night a huge Buck jumped out of the ditch and did a 180 when he heard my Deer Gear I bought at the $$ store! No problem John.. I fully understand what was going through you head  :good:if there is anything there to catch it"

I saw something the other day on one of those silly health reports. A single deep fried chicken wing has no less than,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ready,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 375 calories. I will fast from the 25th, no 26th, wait maybe the 28th until the 29th. I had no idea they were that much. No wonder I can't get under 205 anymore."

987741,manitoubass2,2016-12-03 02:10:00,11391,"Johnny, when you mentioned Aacon, is that the actual name? Or is it Aecon?  Just curious"
987742,Old Ironmaker,2016-12-03 02:11:00,8243,"I love the wing tip. I've been pigging out on those babies since I got off strained carrots. Mom is from North Tonawanda NY. I still remember taking the bus to the Saturday market in east Buffalo with Nani and she got wings for free. When they say that the Anchor Bar in Buffalo invented the Buffalo chicken wing I laugh. Maybe they were the first to charge for them. Durkee's hot sauce on wings have been around long before the Anchor Bar served them. When we were babes we could go into bars in the States with Dad and the Uncles and I remember them serving them free like peanuts and there was a bottle of Durkees you smothered them in, this was 1959. My favorite drink at 6 was Birch Beer. Something like Root Beer. I was one of a few Canucks that had a McDonalds burger on the Niagara Falls Boulevard long before we had a Mac's in Canada. They were something like 10 cents each and I could whack out 30 cents worth."

987749,manitoubass2,2016-12-03 03:01:00,11391,"I was curious because Aecon ""was"" working at New Gold mine(where I work) till they got the steeltoe."
987763,Old Ironmaker,2016-12-03 15:43:00,8243,"Aecon is a very large contractor, has been for years. They were mostly mechanical construction and maintenance. Some of their Managers though were 25 years behind the times. More like 40 years behind, before the Occupational Health and Safety Act 1978 came into legislation. More than a few times I told a Superintendent or GF, ""you can't say that man!"" As in ""if you don't like it go home."" Coming from a place with a highly educated Union workforce I was actually shocked. I couldn't work for them, I hope the culture has changed today."
987766,manitoubass2,2016-12-03 16:22:00,11391,"Nope, hasnt changed one bit!"
987768,Old Ironmaker,2016-12-03 16:47:00,8243,"When you get a chance read one of those little Green paperbacks hanging from a chain on the job site. Most likely for you guys Rick it would be The Ontario Health and Safety Act for Mines and Mining Plants. I know you have, haven't others? Does everyone sleep through WHIMIS? It's all there in black and white. I really couldn't believe what I saw and heard on those sites. It was like going back to the 70's at Stelco. The year I worked as MOL inspector I told my manager most of the construction sites were in violation each and everyday, manufacturing plants were generally compliant. His reply and I adopted it would be ""do you fish?"" yep, "" do you catch them all?""  Oops Hi-Jack alert. This is what we would talk about at the GTG, fishing a bit too. Always the way. Get away fishing with the guys at the plant and talk about what? WORK!!!!"
987769,manitoubass2,2016-12-03 16:57:00,11391,"Aecon was basically booted from the site due to violations of the regs.  That and I was shocked at how many of their employees acted. Nothing like welding ""tims a good dresser"" to the structure of the mill.  They were also notorius for ignoring all road signs on site.  Anyhow yes, back to fishing lol"

I just read a few online reviews about the Ale House, they were all positive. 6 bucks a pound for wings on Tues and Thursdays with a few carrots and celery add a buck. One reviewer didn't think a few veggies were worth a Loonie. We had a customer at the restaurant that would bring a pocket full with him on Wing Night. The strange thing was they were included in a pound of wings!  Someone did mention that they have live music those Wing nights and it gets very loud. She suggested if you want a table further from the band so you can have a conversation to get there well before 8 which is when the band goes on. So 7 PM is a great time, 1 would be better for this night blind old bat."

987664,Old Ironmaker,2016-12-02 02:22:00,8243,"A fellow Stelco worker was murdered there by a POS gang banger I can't remember how many years ago. He was an Industrial Mechanic from the lake that lived around the corner. He was having wings with his wife and young son and a so called tough guy gang bangers beat him to death in the hallway when he came to the defence of someone they were bullying. Art Rosenthal. I didn't work with him but it doesn't mater. I will not go there to celebrate anything. I wouldn't go to Dealey Plaza in Dallas to have a picnic either. I'm surprised it still is a bar. For anyone that frequents the place to have fun has no respect for a common good guy that lost his life there for nothing, including the owners. I do not wish them well.  And if you frequent the place Kalvin and know the circumstances, I am surprised, no respect."
987669,Loonietoon,2016-12-02 03:50:00,1450,"John what happened happened, i was not aware it was the same place, but you can not blame the new owners for what happened in the past that was probably out of there knowledge as well.. so we need to stop pointing fingers at the wrong people .John.."
987675,Fish Farmer,2016-12-02 12:59:00,2234,"I didn't know that was the place, I do remember that incident, was a tragedy. It would give you a weird feeling going in the place. I bet the new owners are always question about the incident. Walking over where a guy that was murdered going to the washroom. I see your feeling John."
