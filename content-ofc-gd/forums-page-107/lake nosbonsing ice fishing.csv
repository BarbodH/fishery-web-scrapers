The reason we chose this over Nippising is because with everything included, its cheaper, and they are letting us stay 12 hours as opposed to 8-9 hours on nippising. Also possibly less busy than Nippising.  So has anyone ice fished Nosbonsing in the past and done well? Any reason to not go there and head to Nippising instead?  Any tips would be appreciated.  Thanks and happy new year!"
989800,Sterling,2017-01-02 00:50:00,477,There's a reason Nosbonsing is cheaper and less busy; fewer fish to be caught. At least you might be able to get some keepers on Nos though.
989803,Old Ironmaker,2017-01-02 01:12:00,8243,^ exactly. You get what you pay for Huzz. Good luck.
989818,Joeytier,2017-01-02 03:59:00,3990,"Less busy is a bit of a stretch.  Nosbonsing has full time residences from end to end, and a ton of traffic once the ice sets up.  There are definitely some nice walleye to be caught, but you're not going to be able to catch fish steadily in the shack all day.  You will probably have to work for them, but you should have some good evening bites.  Good luck."

Great cabins and huts, but the fishing was terrible.  I think we got skunked.   That being said, we pretty much do this trip every year and most years the fishing has been horrible no matter where we went.   Been to Boshkung, Kashagawigamog, Bernard, Clear Lake (near Hunstville) and Esson Lake....forget where else.  We've actually only done well on Simcoe, Lake of Bays and Bernard at other times though.   These trips have turned into more of a fun get together than a fishing trip now, lol."
989823,huzzsaba,2017-01-02 06:37:00,884,Thanks for the replies. Seems like nippising might be a better idea.
989827,porkpie,2017-01-02 11:30:00,2521,"Go to Nippising.  I have been taking my kids for the last few years for 4 days to a week  in the area during the summer.  They love to get onto Nippising.  It's always a good time.  You may not get many dinner fish, but the perch bite can be pretty good, and we usually manage a couple of keeper pickerel."
