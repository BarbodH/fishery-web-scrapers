I've been here since Canada was 93 and arrived on that date. My family gave everything they could to contribute!  I ordered some so I can give them to my grandkids as a keepsakes as I did with Canada Post centennial stamps and coins that I had a hand in Producing.  I will use what I can! As Canada means a lot to is."
