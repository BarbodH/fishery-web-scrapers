989215,Raf,2016-12-21 16:46:00,3495,"i drive by it periodically and the lake is really drawn down this year -- moreso than other years I think.  not sure why the dumped so much out of the locks, anticipating a lot of runoff in the spring?"
989217,Tom S,2016-12-21 17:43:00,362,I don't think the reservoir ever really filled up this year. Next to nothing from snow melt and a very dry summer.
989231,porkpie,2016-12-21 21:49:00,2521,"It was extremely low all summer, I drive by almost every day.  The fishery will be stressed as it stands, never mind adding angling pressure.  It's a good call I think."
989237,huzzsaba,2016-12-21 22:18:00,884,"I went there this fall and they told us there was growth of toxic algae, so not to keep any fish.  Probably due to low water levels and the heat"
989285,netminder,2016-12-22 13:24:00,514,"Pretty much the only time I saw the lake full was first thing in the spring. Rest of the year it was basically empty. Only made it out there twice, and that was on the same weekend on pike/walleye opener. This doesn't surprise me at all."
989291,Jon,2016-12-22 14:07:00,209,"Also due in large part to the low water, ice fishing will be different this year at Island Lake in Orangeville. No heated hut rentals and the derby will be 3 days rather than the month of February.  http://www.creditvalleyca.ca/enjoy-the-outdoors/conservation-areas/island-lake-conservation-area/  Jon"
989303,misfish,2016-12-22 22:02:00,29133,"Someone with a head on thier shoulders, made the right decision. Why put more stress on a lake that has had enough already from nature it,s self this year.  Good call I say.  As for the Inland Orangeville lake, they should follow suit IMO. That is a shallow lake that has also felt the pressure from mother nature.  Im sure it has not changed from 30+ years ago when I use to fish it. Close it for the season. You will do more good , then harm."
989344,hotsky,2016-12-23 04:59:00,400,"I went fishing off a kayak there In September, that was my first time at Belwood ever actually and I could tell the water was extremely low, I did not catch a single fish that day. :/  I was kinda looking forward to going ice fishing there this winter but I guess not if the lake needs a break, that's fine with me."
