I'm only aware of nip. But if there are others out there I'm all ears.
989396,GBW,2016-12-24 03:20:00,8460,following this too.  I recall a few Simcoe places in the past that were good so with luck those guys chime in soon. I'm on Vad the end of Feb so I'm looking for one too.

989402,floater,2016-12-24 05:24:00,220,"We've used Reeds on Nippising for about 6 years now. Great set up with the two huts. One for fishing and cooking and other just for sleeping in a nice dry, not smelling of fish or cooking!, sleeping hut. We bring a buddy heater for the outhouse! Great service. Have also tried most outfitters on Temagami. Nice and remote feeling up there in the winter."
989406,Garnet,2016-12-24 12:25:00,2056,Ice bungalows is big on Nippissing Rob Hyatt Outdoors.  Simcoe is day huts that I no of.
989407,Tjames09,2016-12-24 13:19:00,664,"I've done overnights on nippising.  Lots of companies offer it. Fishing is decent, walleye were small last year, maybe the spot we were in.  Lake Simcoe has tons of day huts."
989425,Joeytier,2016-12-24 23:03:00,3990,"Go to Nipissing if you wanna you wanna keep the rods bent and stay close to the shack.  Like others have said, there's many good options, I'd recommend Rob Hyatt's or Tama Kwa on the south shore"
989447,Sterling,2016-12-25 03:17:00,477,Nipissing is hot hot hot if you don't mind C&R. Fish in Callander Bay or any other shallow area for good karma.
