985148,captpierre,2016-11-03 20:15:00,2521,Was in the Markham location this morning. Still lots of lures including Muskie stuff. Staff were still unpacking more Rapalas to hang on walls. Lures 40% off. 30% for most of the rest. There goes another $100. $60 actually ?
985167,chris.brock,2016-11-03 23:51:00,4053," Thanks for the heads up Cap't.  Yeah, I'm still getting LeBaron's emails. If I don't go north this weekend I may go east to the Mississauga store."

987574,captpierre,2016-12-01 03:03:00,2521,"That would be a good thing, for me at least."
987575,reelingMachine,2016-12-01 03:10:00,29,"good news. I did not compare literally, but they had better prices for some stuff. I always bought Power Pro lines there."
987576,Dutch01,2016-12-01 03:18:00,1431,This would be good news to me too.
987592,Duckie,2016-12-01 14:20:00,305,for their own good the new store better be open Sundays.. Retail business thrive on weekend business. Not being open Sundays just means your customers go to Bass Pro or Sail or whatever for their weekend shopping..
987599,Raf,2016-12-01 14:59:00,3495,Forget open Sundays.  What they need is an online presence that does not consist of pdf links.

987802,okumasheffield,2016-12-04 03:36:00,318,Visited the Markham store 1st time since the out-of-business new was released.  It was very sad to see a store I have spent years of my time at has become almost empty and to learn employees I have become friends with over the years are moving on as well.  I hope they have learned their lessons and make necessary adjustments to be a contender to other big-brand stores.
987812,Moosebunk,2016-12-04 14:28:00,3970,Believe they are done and doors closed here in Ottawa now.  Always liked LeB's.  Personally never an issue with service.  Mail order was excellent all the way to Attawapiskat and Moose Factory during those years too.  Too bad.
988968,okumasheffield,2016-12-18 17:12:00,318,"Goodbye, LeBaron."
988976,PUMP KNOWS,2016-12-18 17:47:00,937,Did anyone pick up anything at 75% off?
