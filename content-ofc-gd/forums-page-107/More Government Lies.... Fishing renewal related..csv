989295,G.mech,2016-12-22 16:28:00,830,"But don't you need to carry a paper license in addition to your card when you opt for a single year license?  With a three year license, all you need is the card.  That's worth paying up front to me.  Plus, if the price increases during those three years, I don't have to pay the new price.     Agreed 100% on the card thing but the provincial government would never increase the fees we pay would they???"
989300,kickingfrog,2016-12-22 19:55:00,8333,Did mine Sunday. More likely to be in the woods early in the new year than the lakes. For a full three years it isn't awful at $60 per year for the use I try to get out of it but it's not the best time of the year to be shelling out for one... more..... thing.  Online Sunday Dec. 11. Arrived Thursday Dec. 22.
989301,Dara,2016-12-22 21:13:00,3052,I ordered my renewal a couple weeks ago and got it today...time to go fishing

They were right to charge him but they charged him for the wrong reason, your safety equipment cannot be dual purpose There might also be a 1 mile visibility thing and a phone is awful dim light.  Dara, do you know how he made out."
988528,Old Ironmaker,2016-12-13 03:24:00,8243,"Can one make a citizens arrest on line? Why someone would brag about not buying a license is beyond me. I can admit to speeding but somehow not buying a license leaves a bad taste in my mouth. None of you guys had better complain about the lack of enforcement or funding for the fishery. The worse thing you can be called in Hamilton is a Goof. Them there are fightn' words. I'm disappointed in you 2. Why admit being a Goof is amazing to me. Mr. G, tell me it aint so. Mr. G, no, I respected you, and from me respect is something important and earned from me. This Gaspumper guy I'm not familiar with.  I don't see how difficult it can be to walk into a CTC or Home Hardware and buy a license. You are probably in there anyway. To blame the Gov. because you are having problems buying on line is silly. Yes it's a conspiracy, the Ministry makes it difficult just to annoy you. Come on Man!  Please tell me you guys are kidding. Please."

HST on licences...they are neither a good nor a service, they have no value other than keeping you out of jail if you get caught fishing.  A guy at work was in court today...it seemed to be game warden day. A guy there got stopped 50' from his cabin in a boat this summer...a blitz they call it...all his gear was fine except he only had a smart phone for a flashlight...CO says no good...gotta be waterproof. The guy says, its in a waterproof case guaranteed to 30'. Warden says no good...here's your $240.00 ticket...have a nice day. Now its in court for the judge..CO gets a day off...and there was 4 of them there trying to talk people into just paying the cheap shot tickets.  Another guy, in a boat with the wife and 2 kids, all with life jackets on paddling around a little bay in front of their cabin. OMG, no tags on the kids jackets...$240.00 a piece buddy...what is this province coming to.  I called my MPP who was also consumer affairs minister at the time,  2 years ago to inform him of a serious billing error from union gas affecting thousands of people and putting money in unions pocket...sorry...I'm not going against the gas company  as an adder, I just heard Iraq was purchasing F-35's at $100 million each..if it wasn't for a gas plant cancellation Ontario could have 10 of them  Rant over..LOL"

989177,Old Ironmaker,2016-12-20 21:21:00,8243,"I too am going to stop paying for a fishing license. 2019 is the last time I buy one, unless they change the law and they will.  I never pay the Gov. more than I need to, vehicle tag, fishing license, no way, never. Even if I pay 2 bucks more every year I am still ahead buying it 1 year at a time."

I've never understood people bragging about how much income tax they are going to get back    The bigger the balance I have outstanding after figuring it out the better and I wait till the last day to give it to them and  not one red cent over what I possibly can avoid."
989182,Old Ironmaker,2016-12-20 22:03:00,8243,Exactly Dave. The only way some can save money is overpaying on their income tax. A very smart and rich man once told me a very successful person owes millions when he dies. Legacy is over rated.  Always better in my pocket than theirs. I don't want to go into a long accounting equation over 60 bucks but if I invest that and get my average ROI my last years license is less than 20 bucks paying 1 year at a time.

988206,Dara,2016-12-09 03:07:00,3052,At least they tell us how much a license costs. Not so with carbon tax. That will be hidden deeply in the bill so we never know

So I tried to use the phone method but realized that with the phone, there was no way to print a temporary card and I would have to wait weeks for the card to be mailed to me.  So, I eventually went old school and got mine at the tackle shop."
988293,Sinker,2016-12-10 14:39:00,8692,I'm always amazed at the people who complain about paying $30 a YEAR to fish. Seriously? You probably spend more than that on gas to get to your fishing spot. Its probably the cheapest license there is.  S.
988294,Mister G,2016-12-10 14:39:00,1429,I no longer bother purchasing a license. It's less aggravating and less expensive not having one depending on how long you don't get caught. Never been asked for one so I'm pretty much ahead of the game....
