974826,kickingfrog,2016-06-25 22:26:00,8333,My brother doctored his before using.  
974828,GBW,2016-06-25 22:51:00,8460,"So, how did it go with them?"
974830,kickingfrog,2016-06-25 23:07:00,8333,Working on it.  Winding down after a 3:31am wake-up.
989734,kickingfrog,2016-12-31 21:30:00,8333,"About 25 years ago my brother had a top water frog set-up that had 2 hollow rubber frogs connected by 8 inches of steel leader material. Wonder what ever happened to it?   Bringing this back to the top because my brother found this digging around in his basement. The rubber skirts are dry and brittle, the wire is about 10 inches long.  "
989737,Rizzo,2016-12-31 22:34:00,4754,"I think the sideways swim is brilliant. When we feed the sharks in myrtle beach you toss a live, normal fish in they leave it alone. Drill one off the dock first so it  lays on its side and flops around on the surface they nail it without fail every single time"
973691,manitoubass2,2016-06-15 00:36:00,11391,Sure it will. You can impart action on the lure using your rod.  I wont be buying any and im not trying to justify it.
973692,Steve,2016-06-15 00:36:00,2075,"I'm going to buy that as a gag gift for somebody, that's beyond ridiculous, I felt embarrassed watching Mercer plug that thing  I'm sure Grant is making it worth Mercers while to plug that thing, lol."
973697,manitoubass2,2016-06-15 00:40:00,11391," I fish alot of top waters and nothing on the lure matter but hooks, and floatation well size too.  Everytop water lure I own is black if I can get it. Or white.  Doesnt even need any ""fish/frog/whatever"" details are added  A fish will hit a squash ball if you toss it out"
973714,FrankTheRabbit,2016-06-15 01:30:00,479,"I will admit, sometimes the quality of the bait will matter. I was using Booyah topwater frogs that were around $5.50 at the time. LT Frogs were around $12.50. The Booyah frogs lasted maybe 5-8 bass and then on forth, it would be ripped to, takes in water really easily, and the tassels would 1/4 missing. LT Frogs have lasted me much longer for sure."
973715,kickingfrog,2016-06-15 01:33:00,8333,"  when was the last time you saw a fish just cruising alone, on its side, on the surface, lol.   Every dying one right before another fish eats it which is why you don't see it often."
973830,aplumma,2016-06-15 20:50:00,6896,If you want a real unique action with a high hookup ratio try this Live target Mouse. It outfishes there frogs for bass 2-1 every time. I put this lure on during any topwater bite.  .
973834,misfish,2016-06-15 20:58:00,29133,  Every dying one right before another fish eats it which is why you don't see it often.  Always on top of your game Rob.
973836,Old Ironmaker,2016-06-15 21:14:00,8243,Just like an old Lunker that learns what and what not to fall for I won't be spending 20 more Samolians for a Live Target bait.
973838,manitoubass2,2016-06-15 21:59:00,11391,The lipless crank shiner lure is worth the $13. Really good lure on soft water or hardwater
973839,Steve,2016-06-15 22:03:00,2075,"the live target banana baits and live target smelts are also quality baits...once you swap out the cheap hooks and split rings.  live target frogs are ""ok"". cheap chinese hooks, and the material doesn't collapse as easily as spro's....but, they still certainly work.  i note the baits in this thread show ""trokar"" hooks for the brand...that is an improvement on what they use on the standard kopper frogs. (maybe the frogs will follow suit with trokar hooks?)  some of the Livetarget baits are top notch (with some required alterations), some are simply used to catch fisherman....  I have a feeling those who buy this bait also have some baitballs in their tackle box"
973849,PUMP KNOWS,2016-06-15 23:46:00,937,"I'm gonna give this mouse another chance.  The first time I used it, it would take in water so fast.  If you want a real unique action with a high hookup ratio try this Live target Mouse. It outfishes there frogs for bass 2-1 every time. I put this lure on during any topwater bite.  ."
973850,kickingfrog,2016-06-15 23:49:00,8333,No baitballs for the 3 anglers who'll be using these hollow bodies.   I asked my brother today about the tandem frog bait from many years ago. He said it never worked very well. The frogs were small and they never sat well in the water.
973929,fish_fishburn,2016-06-16 16:42:00,1311,"The mouse in white is my go to bait for searching shallow largies in the pads. long casts and fast retrieve, when they expose themselves we move in and catch em."
973988,GBW,2016-06-17 02:36:00,8460," about 90% of my topwater baits ( we called them plugs way back when ) were BLACK, especially fishing in the evening. Because at night a dark colour on top when a fish looks up 'they say' is easier for a fish to see."
973989,GBW,2016-06-17 02:38:00,8460,when I use a frog these are the one's I use and have used for the past two years.  the rabbit fur leg ones have crazy action and it's a solid strip of fur so it cannot be pulled off/out. 
974276,manjo39,2016-06-20 14:40:00,354,I picked up a few gifts for the bass fishermen in my boat for opener:    Not sure if they'll replace rubber frogs but at least they don't have legs to get pulled off.  How did the Sunfish work for you?
974299,dave524,2016-06-20 19:11:00,4508,Bet they will interest seagulls floating on the surface
974302,kickingfrog,2016-06-20 19:25:00,8333,"Bet they will interest seagulls floating on the surface  Yep. Just like every other topwater. One eye on the lure, the other on the sky."
974305,dave524,2016-06-20 19:39:00,4508," Yep. Just like every other topwater. One eye on the lure, the other on the sky.  Never had a problem with black Jitterbugs and Hula poppers but have had them eye a floating Rapala"
974310,kickingfrog,2016-06-20 19:47:00,8333,Zara spooks seem to be the most interesting to seagulls.
974312,kenzy31,2016-06-20 20:08:00,261,"I second that ^^ I've pulled a Super Spook away from more seagulls than fish I think lol. Hooked one 5-6 years ago at the Barrie waterfront, took me 10 mins to reel it in and an old fella beside me threw on a work glove and had freed in 30 seconds. What a show that ordeal was"
974314,misfish,2016-06-20 20:19:00,29133,Oh they attack spinner baits too. Had one dive bomb and grab one. I didnt see it coming.LOL   Bet they will interest seagulls floating on the surface  
974408,skeeter99,2016-06-21 13:16:00,109,they are actually pretty deadly  I out fished my partner 16 to  7   with the bluegill pattern  he was throwing a spro frog that day   but hey in previous posts they said a hot dog with hooks will work  so why are the muskie guys not throwing a schnieders juicy jumbos !!  LOL !!
974417,AKRISONER,2016-06-21 14:57:00,5558,"Zara spooks seem to be the most interesting to seagulls.  ive literally had to stop fishing until the gull gave up and went away.  the zara super spook jr is by far my fave lure of all time, i fish it literally 40+% of my time fishing. dont let the secret out about these lures though, i wouldnt want anyone to catch so many fish."
974420,JoshS,2016-06-21 15:26:00,729,"I can see bass eating that lure, looks like you can walk the dog with it. Gimmicky as it is."
973542,kickingfrog,2016-06-14 01:39:00,8333,I picked up a few gifts for the bass fishermen in my boat for opener:    Not sure if they'll replace rubber frogs but at least they don't have legs to get pulled off.
973547,Steve,2016-06-14 02:23:00,2075,"so are they designed to be fished so they look like the bait is swimming flat on its side, or are they weighted so that they swim properly....but then the hooks would be sideways?"
973548,FrankTheRabbit,2016-06-14 02:35:00,479,"They're made to swim upright, with the hooks facing upwards, just like the regular frogs.  Just another top water option to try out. I think I will stick with my LT hollow body frogs and Horny Toads.  "
973550,Dan668,2016-06-14 02:55:00,1120,"I know a few who have used them,  overall consensus is that they liked them but they found they were not hooking up with as many in comparison to the LT frog."
973567,manitoubass2,2016-06-14 06:48:00,11391,They will catch fish. Enough said
973600,Raycaster,2016-06-14 15:13:00,528,"I'm embarrassed...  Friend bought one for me and I thought it was a screwed up crank bait or something! Had no action and just sat on the top like a dead fish waiting for seagulls to grab it, useless.. LOL!  signed... newbie"
973609,kickingfrog,2016-06-14 16:29:00,8333,"Borrowing from Monty Python: Not dead,  but dead-ish."
973618,hunteronwheels,2016-06-14 17:14:00,112,lets hope they hook more than just me lol   
973627,kickingfrog,2016-06-14 18:11:00,8333, lets hope they hook more than just me lol    Well there's 2 of us.  And here is the flip side with the ballast:   3.5 inch weighs 5/8 oz and the 3 inch is 7/16 oz.
973640,FrankTheRabbit,2016-06-14 19:09:00,479,I wonder if you could tie on a 3-way swivel and have two of them working the pads/grass. lol Just thinking of it based on A-rigs that ppl use. lol
973644,kickingfrog,2016-06-14 19:25:00,8333,About 25 years ago my brother had a top water frog set-up that had 2 hollow rubber frogs connected by 8 inches of steel leader material. Wonder what ever happened to it?
973647,FrankTheRabbit,2016-06-14 19:56:00,479,Worth seeing how many fish u can get with that setup
973655,206,2016-06-14 20:38:00,563, Well there's 2 of us.  And here is the flip side with the ballast:   3.5 inch weighs 5/8 oz and the 3 inch is 7/16 oz. So the side I see is more appealing than the side the fish see's? Makes sense
973678,Steve,2016-06-15 00:10:00,2075,"so they are designed to be reeled in on their sides, like a flat fish on the surface....  yep, another koppers live target bait designed to catch fisherman.  when was the last time you saw a fish just cruising alone, on its side, on the surface, lol."
973679,misfish,2016-06-15 00:15:00,29133,Rob has a thing about getting hooked.
973680,dave524,2016-06-15 00:18:00,4508,"Topwater bass, you could probably thread a chunk of hotdog on one of those double hooks and if you retrieved it right with a few pauses and twitches and catch just as many fish."
973681,Steve,2016-06-15 00:19:00,2075,"and if you painted the hot dog real purdy, you could pay $20 bucks from Koppers for it"
973682,manitoubass2,2016-06-15 00:20:00,11391,"Its just like a frog or any other top water bait.  Pretty sure fish hit it because of the disturbance, not the paint job.  Its funny how many lures are painted up like works of art for top water"

Throwing a spinner bait and boiling it. Same thing."
973685,Steve,2016-06-15 00:29:00,2075,"but a top water frog, lets say a Spro dean rojas frog, still walks the dog, chugs, and moves ""like a frog"". a popper pops.  that will literally just be dragged in....and doesn't represent anything. it won't create much of a disturbance."
