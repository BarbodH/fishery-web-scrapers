989317,leaf4,2016-12-23 01:08:00,2466,"I've been happy with my pfleuger supreme, I believe it was in that price range when I bought it"
989319,Joeytier,2016-12-23 01:37:00,3990,"This.  I want to say Sahara but the Pfleuger has honestly been surprisingly bulletproof, whereas the Sahara has a couple flaws that are very common and very annoying."
989320,J Roelofsen,2016-12-23 01:40:00,84,"I agree 100% with the Pflueger recommdation. The Supreme is right in that price range and worth every penny. I'm slowly converting my spinning reels over to Pflueger from Shimano. As someone who beats on their gear and does thier own reel maintenance I have nothing but good things to say about Pflueger products. Their designs are very simple, clean and efficient.....to me that translates to reliability. I used to be a Shimano fan but the quality of thier mid range products has taken a big crap. Daiwa makes some nice spinning models but tear one down or try to get service and you'll be flustered. And I won't even go near a Quantum product.  Best value = Pflueger IMO  Josh"
989326,Moosebunk,2016-12-23 02:47:00,3970,"If you still can, pick up a Symetre before they're done.  They're work horses for the money."
989331,adempsey,2016-12-23 03:03:00,1498,"I'd say whatever Shimano you can get on sale in that price range.   Pflueger are nice, but I don't like how they feel when reeling in.  I think it's the handle, but haven't tested one in a long time.  Rear drag version on sale at Fishing World https://fishingworld.ca/products/6657-shimano-symetre-2500rj  Not sure I like that model, but some do.  Also on sale at Cabela's http://www.cabelas.com/product/Shimano-Symetre-Spinning-Reel/1398668.uts"
989332,Freshtrax,2016-12-23 03:04:00,2215,That's what  at I was leaning towards.  Might have to pick up 2
989341,smitty55,2016-12-23 04:33:00,928,I'll throw another player out there for you. The Daiwa SS Tournament Series has a longstanding reputation for quality and durability even though they only have 3 bearings. Often described as bulletproof. Just a thought.  http://www.daiwa.com/us/contents/reels/ss_t/index.html  Cheers
989342,captpierre,2016-12-23 04:39:00,2521,Agreed.
989343,hotsky,2016-12-23 04:50:00,400,+1 for Symetre
989349,dave524,2016-12-23 12:34:00,4508,"+1  on the Daiwa Whisker Tournament , got a couple, been using them for Steelies and the odd salmon since the late 80's, oldschool and bulletproof."
989355,porkpie,2016-12-23 14:57:00,2521,Without question the diawa 1300 or 700 are still some of the best reels out there for that money.  I have a pair of each and they've held up to hard use for years!
989356,Musky Plug,2016-12-23 15:09:00,398,"If you still can, pick up a Symetre before they're done.  They're work horses for the money.   x3 on the Symetre. Good bang for you buck!"
989358,Gallie,2016-12-23 15:48:00,1215,"Pflueger all day, ive hauled in everything from crappie and perch to monster pike and 30+lb carp in on mine. You wont find a better real for the price."
989378,Freshtrax,2016-12-23 22:28:00,2215,Ended up getting a NASCI 3000   Feels nicer than a saros that was on sale for around the same price.
989387,captpierre,2016-12-24 00:29:00,2521,Was looking for another Symetre  at LeBarron sale. Only had the NASCI left. Said it was the replacement for the outgoing Symetre
989392,fishdawg,2016-12-24 02:32:00,912,I will suggest something differnt... the Okuma RTX
989395,GBW,2016-12-24 03:17:00,8460,I will suggest something differnt... the Okuma RTX He did make his purchase but I have never had luck with the 2 Okuma's I have purchased in the past
989399,Freshtrax,2016-12-24 03:36:00,2215,"I love okuma linecounters.    And I did pickup all the recommended reels but they all felt ""weird""  not bad but different as I mostly fish shimano .  I'm shure my dad will enjoy it even though he only fishes about 10 times a year."
989404,manitoubass2,2016-12-24 05:57:00,11391,"Im sure he'll love it!  GBW, I rarely hear anything good about okuma reels except linecounters.  But my favorite ""cheap"" reels are okuma avengers.they are like 40 bux and awesome reels.  Highly suggest to anyone for a backlack reel or shorefishing reel if ya happen to come across them"
