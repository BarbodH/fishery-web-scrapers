988865,Ralph Field,2016-12-17 00:40:00,1018,"The green version is what I had trouble with. Like Brian I'm using Windows 10 and they just did an update the other day, so perhaps that somehow caused the problem."

Thought I was either blind or had a wacky computer glitch going on. Well, I found it...accidentally. On my computer, the words ""change theme"" and the background are the same colour! I scrolled over it with the mouse and it changed to white. Sneaky!! LOL"
