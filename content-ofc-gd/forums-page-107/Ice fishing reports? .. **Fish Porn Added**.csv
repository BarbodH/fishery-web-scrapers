989113,PUMP KNOWS,2016-12-19 23:06:00,937,Wow that's crazy!
989115,wormdunker,2016-12-19 23:31:00,1711,Nice slabs Nick!  You got me drooling!  I'm 1 of those guys watching TV waiting for safe ice on Simcoe.
989120,Jds63,2016-12-20 00:21:00,1365,Thanks for the post ! Itching to get out there soon too!
989127,NAW,2016-12-20 01:14:00,4022,"Nice fish, you have good taste in augers as well! My girlfriend bought me that last year for Christmas!  I hardly use my power auger now..  So lights and stiff. Cuts like butter!  Nice bud. Nice hub too. LOL  This weekend is going to be the start. I cant take another weekend of not fishing. I'm grounded this weekend.  But good luck out there Bri!  Nice haul there Nick, won't be long now till I can get out, killing me with those slab pictures, we have pretty good crappie on our home lake now, five minute ride round our point….2 more days at work and then I'm off!!!!  We have around 12"" of ice here now, love having the ice road, saves about 20 minutes of the ride to town.          Jesus Simon!  That makes me jealous.  I would have an amazing fish hut if I had a season that long!  It would be like a second home.  Nice slabs Nick!  You got me drooling!  I'm 1 of those guys watching TV waiting for safe ice on Simcoe. If I had to wait untill Simcoe froze over before I went out ice fishing,...  I'd be one angry bear."
989155,Acountdeleted,2016-12-20 14:40:00,2562,"I'll add a bit of fish porn    In Nick's hut with his power heater. I felt guilty to be honest, this is the most comfortable I have ever been ice fishing.    The missus likes selfies so I decided to send her one of us out on the ice.    A bit of dinner/snack. Nick would like you to know most of these are his. But I did land 1 crappie and a couple of perch."
989158,manitoubass2,2016-12-20 14:50:00,11391,Nice going guys!!!!  Set up looks perfect too!
989165,NAW,2016-12-20 16:54:00,4022,The set up is great!!  Big fat fish hut.  Easily fish 2 guys in it.  The 10ln tank I found on the side of the road for free!  And the heaters was on sale at CT...  Keeps the place toasty warm on the lowest setting.  I used to hate fishing out of huts.  But I am getting to much grey in my beard these days!!
989173,Tjames09,2016-12-20 20:06:00,664,"what auger do you use?"""
989174,Old Ironmaker,2016-12-20 20:58:00,8243,"Them there are some nice pics Nick. You have gotten an early start on most of you ice guys.  Bigugly Bruce. Open water Perch? In this weather? You are either a tough dude or are crazy, maybe a little of both.  The way the temps have been and the wind blowing here we should have ice on Long Point Bay this winter.  Keep all the ice fishing reports coming, I am really looking forward to our 30 year Nipissing reunion this winter. 9 in so far. 1 coming from Atlanta Ga. I couldn't believe how many places were still available to rent. 25 years ago there were waiting lists at Nip. If we didn't give a deposit for next year before we left no guarantee we would get a rental cottage. And the prices are nearly the same as 20 years ago."
989018,NAW,2016-12-18 23:53:00,4022,"Anyone venture out this weekend?  Im getting eager to see some ice fishing reports!!  I made it out twice. Friday, and Today.  The ice in Simcoe County is rubbish at the moment.  Because of that, we couldn't run and gun.  Heck, we couldn't even make it to the honey hole....  Managed only 8 fish total..  Enough for a tasty fish fry for dinner that I just finished!!!  Anyone else make it out, and want to share some fish porn?  I'll post a few pics tomorrow..."
989019,Terry,2016-12-18 23:55:00,14456,"not me, but hoping to get out tuesday"
989021,hotsky,2016-12-19 00:09:00,400,Still waiting for things to freeze up  Any ice south of Barrie?
989022,Locnar,2016-12-19 00:22:00,645,"I'm eager to get out, but not eager to fall through. My main target is a small lake south of Minden...Any ideas on ice formation up there?  Good to hear you got at least a fish fry out of it! What did ya catch?"
989026,manitoubass2,2016-12-19 00:42:00,11391,Pics NAW?  Post a report!!!
989038,bigugli,2016-12-19 01:44:00,6138,Nothing ready in Niagara. I''l be hunting open water for perch this week.
989045,wormdunker,2016-12-19 02:38:00,1711,A little too early for me Nick.  I'm concentrating on Christmas at this time for my family.  After Jan 1 I'll be chomping at the bit to get on the ice.  What species did you catch?  We like pix!
989047,NAW,2016-12-19 02:48:00,4022,"Everytime I open photobucket on my phone, I get nasty pop up that messes my phone up..  That's why I havnt posted any pics yet."
989061,Acountdeleted,2016-12-19 13:03:00,2562,Posting pics here is such a pain. It's why I've cut back on the reports.
989063,lew,2016-12-19 13:09:00,12766,"Posting pics here is such a pain. It's why I've cut back on the reports.  Use Photobucket, it doesn't get any simpler."
989064,RickOnt,2016-12-19 13:11:00,669,Nick  Try IMGUR  Photobucket has been really messed up lately
989066,Dara,2016-12-19 13:51:00,3052,Never got fishing but we did get snowmobiling  
989069,NAW,2016-12-19 14:20:00,4022,"I just signed up for Imgur. Lets give this a try.  SO far, it seems better than Photobucket.  The pop-ups aren't there, and it seems more stable.   Here's my first Crappie of the season.  Dec 16th.   Here's the keepers for the day. Not much to show for. But it's better than sitting in front of the TV! The hut...And the short walk back to the truck.I'm not going to comment on the exact ice conditions.  They where Crappie.  Seriously.  The ice is not safe yet.  But I am very very safe while out there, will all of the gear, and a partner to help pull me out!Soon though.  It will be good with a few more good cold nights."
989070,AKRISONER,2016-12-19 14:29:00,5558,"judging by that hole...that is some sketchy ice lol...a little cold never hurt nobody though.  Well done, im hoping to have some gators on the ice by thursday."
989079,Terry,2016-12-19 15:56:00,14456,Nice. Just getting out there is great.  Getting some fish is a bonus.
989085,Acountdeleted,2016-12-19 17:18:00,2562,I don't have a working laptop and I find it tricky on my phone.
989086,Fisherpete,2016-12-19 18:04:00,1814,"Photobucket has been beyond terrible, same problems here. Will try that other photo site soon. Need to post some fishies!"
989087,Joeytier,2016-12-19 18:12:00,3990,"Nice, Nick!  The ice looks decent enough?  Obviously hard to tell from pictures.  We got into the splake Saturday, drove the machines on the lake too."
989088,manitoubass2,2016-12-19 18:20:00,11391,My photobucket started acting up with ads and freezing all the time.  So I moved it to my sd card and havent had a problem since
989090,Acountdeleted,2016-12-19 18:42:00,2562,"Nice, Nick! The ice looks decent enough? Obviously hard to tell from pictures. We got into the splake Saturday, drove the machines on the lake too.  A lot of it was slush. (I wasn't there for the day of these photos but Nick and I went out Sunday) was glad we both had float suits, spud bars and lots of rope."
