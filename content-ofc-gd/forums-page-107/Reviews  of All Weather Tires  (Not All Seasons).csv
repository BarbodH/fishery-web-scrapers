989068,Dara,2016-12-19 14:00:00,3052,Changeover and storage is easy here. The dealer charges $20.00 to switch tires and $20.00 to store the ones you take off. I never need to touch a tire
989077,BillM,2016-12-19 15:27:00,17367,"If I was going to get an 'all weather' tire, it would be Nokian hands down.  Currently running Hakkapeliitta r2s on my 335d, traction is fantastic even with all that torque."

989170,Sinker,2016-12-20 19:56:00,8692,"I prefer dedicated winter tires. That said, I haven't tried these "" all weather"" tires, but I don't think they are as good as true winter tires.  I drive a lot, (80K/yr) and having the best tires I can get is worth it for me. I'm running dunlop sj6's on mine right now and they are great. They are a little noisy, but I kinda like to hear them hum. I don't even know there is snow on the road, even at high speed, and they stop really, really good. HUGE difference from my all season....night and day.  My all seasons last for years, and my winters last for years too, so I don't see any significant gain by going to ""all weather"" tires.  BTW, my tires are also 235/55/18 and were a little hard to find.  S."
989171,BillM,2016-12-20 19:57:00,17367,Bump that up to a 235/65 and you'd have a lot more choices.
989176,Old Ironmaker,2016-12-20 21:07:00,8243,"I tested the Hankooks last night when I came around the corner too fast on 6"" of packed ice, not a scheduled test. I would have been in the farmers field with a lesser tire.  Get this they are cleaning parking spots in the curb lane with a front end loader and a dump truck in Fisherville last night while Lakeshore Rd has 6 inches of pure ice on it mixed with clean sections and there are 3 foot drifts on Fisherville Rd 5 k's from the village. Idiots."
989219,Weeds,2016-12-21 18:17:00,782,I had a set Nokian WR's on my 4Runner some 10 years ago. I thought they were fantastic.
989224,Old Ironmaker,2016-12-21 20:56:00,8243,"All weather tires solve the dilemma of driving to Florida in winter. You need winter tires until you get to Tennessee at least but can't drive with them in Florida because you will wear them out in no time in that heat. All weather tires are the answer.  The best snow tires I ever had were Blizzaks on a rear wheel drive BMW. No longer in the budget, nor are BMW's."
989236,huzzsaba,2016-12-21 22:16:00,884,"Thanks to all who posted in this thread.  I guess in conclusion, those who have all weather tires Like them and recommend them and that is good to know.   I agree.  If I decided to drive down to florida with my winter tires on, I would need earplugs lol.  On another note, I heard of people running Pirelli Scorpions Ice& Snow throughout the year (summer included) without issue of them wearing out fast and no issues with them being noisy. Actually some have said they performed better in summer handling wise than their factory all seasons.  Tire rack ranks these very high and 4.5 out of 5.  There is even a review from a guy who runs these Pirellis in Florida and loves them!"
988964,huzzsaba,2016-12-18 16:57:00,884,"Just want to get some reviews from you folks on All weather tires if running them especially things like road noise.Again, Looking for reviews on All weather tires (which is a new category of tires) and NOT all seasons. All Weather tires are winter tires that can be used all year round.  I am looking for reviews for the following tires for my Volvo XC90 SUV with AWD.Nokian WRG2 (used since they are discontinued)Nokian WRG3Nordman WR (supposedly these are the old WRG2 rebranded)Toyo Celcius CUVYokohama Geolandar AT G015"
988967,glen,2016-12-18 17:12:00,2641,Sorry I don't have those brands. I use Hankook all weather.  Road noise low. Tire wear ok if driving less then 25k a year. Traction way better then All season. 8/10.  If you don't have to go on the hwy when it's real bad then these are great tires.

Put them on my wife's CRV and my daughters Cruze and am pretty surprised how good they work.  Both are low mileage vehicles so wear is not really that big a concern.  Two less sets for me to store and change every year, I win!"

Are these the ones exclusively sold at Canadian Tire?
988975,leaf4,2016-12-18 17:46:00,2466,I have a friend who has nokians and they are very noisy
988977,glen,2016-12-18 17:52:00,2641,Yes I heard canadian tire only. Hankook optimo 4s.  I think they are called
988978,G.mech,2016-12-18 17:54:00,830,"Yes I heard canadian tire only. Hankook optimo 4s. I think they are called  Yup, that's the ones I put on too."
988979,Old Ironmaker,2016-12-18 17:59:00,8243,"Are they like summer tires that can be driven in winter? Marketers come up with something every day to sell more stuff.  Huzz, go to the websites for tire retailers that sell those brands and see how they are rated from 0 to 100 for performance, includes braking on ice, snow, noise, wear etc. To get a specific tire that is used by fellow members here is a long shot. I am a Hankook or Cooper tire customer. I recommend both. There are so many tires out there it was mind boggling choosing 1 snow tire this fall. I was in info overload. For best value Firestone always has a sale on. I replaced Firestones on the car after 6 seasons."
988980,huzzsaba,2016-12-18 17:59:00,884,"Its good to know the hankooks are good and that is the reason I am asking here.  I asked the same question on a car forum and the response was to check tire rack for reviews lol, which I already did.  Unfortunately the Hankooks dont come in th esize I need unless.  hopefully they start making SUV size tires."

There are lots of tests and reports on these tires and most are pretty positive, google them if you want.  They've been around for a few years now but are just becoming more popular in North America.  Obviously they're not quite as good as purpose built snow tire in winter or an all season in summer but they are a very good compromise for those who don't travel a lot of miles in extreme conditions."
988984,Old Ironmaker,2016-12-18 18:28:00,8243,"Thanks for the education G.Mech. We need a good winter tire here on the Erie lakeshore. My wife puts on 70KMS a day at least in poorly maintain roads. Just today she woke to find a layer of ice on the road. She took the Altima with the new Hancooks on it rather than the truck with big aggressive Coopers, they don't have the snowflake on them so they may be All Weather tires, need to check that, It wasn't in the budget to buy 12 new tires and 4 new rims. She said the car was better on the ice than the truck tires. I finally convinced her to drive the 4X4 Chev this winter, I can feel an argument, I mean discussion in the near future. I think she should drive what she is more comfortable with. The car has over 300,000 kms, so I want to baby it a bit. I told her many times it doesn't matter what tires she has if she can't keep the vehicle under 120 KMS per hour."
988985,glen,2016-12-18 18:33:00,2641,They didn't have my size either so I got ones that are a little taller.
988998,G.mech,2016-12-18 20:01:00,830,The all weather tires do have the 'snowflake' meaning they are an approved winter tire and you can still get your insurance discount.
989005,huzzsaba,2016-12-18 20:38:00,884,"The all weather tires do have the 'snowflake' meaning they are an approved winter tire and you can still get your insurance discount. The main reason I am looking at All weathers is in case I have to downsize (moving next year) I want to avoid having a second set of tires taking up space plus the headache of seasonal changeover.  The fact that they are approved for winter tire discount is the second reason for getting them.  So far unless hankook decides to come out with my size by next winter, looks like I must narrow it down to the the other 3  (Nokian, Yokohama, Toyo).  Yokohama geolandar G015 is a fairly new tire so not much in the way of reviews.  Toyo Celsius CUV also a fairly new tire.  Nokians I have heard mixed reviews as far as noise is concerned.  Thanks for the info thus far."
989008,Old Ironmaker,2016-12-18 21:06:00,8243,"On any reviews I have seen there are always a few that dislike the same item that got rave reviews from others so I always take online reviews with a grain of salt. Just like recently someone was saying they had nothing but trouble with their Nissan Altima, ours is the most dependable vehicle I have ever owned. I have been destroying cars since 1970. I will never own another Chrysler vehicle for the rest of my life, I couldn't give away a Intrepid I had that looked to be in very good condition, a $1000.00 transmission communication computer every 20,000 kilometers, I scrapped the clean shinny car with 200,000 kms on it. My brother in law that worked for GM in St. Kitts will drive only Chrysler products and has since he was 16, he's 70 now."

They are a tad taller but there are many more options in that size. What size are stock on your vehicle?"

I currently run 255 55 18 on them and can run 235 65 18s but hankook makes none of those sizes  . Looks like Nokians are the best bet.
989020,hotsky,2016-12-19 00:01:00,400,"No experience with all weather tires but I have noticed them on the market. As someone who enjoys a drive of a decent performance tires for 3 seasons and the added safety of a winter tire I wouldn't get or recommend the 'all weather' tire unless the alternative was to keep all season tire year long.  I would recommend not going with a different size unless the overall diameter stays the same, depending on the car going with a taller tire will cause tire rubbing esp when turning, and speedometer and odometer will not be as accurate."
989029,DRIFTER_016,2016-12-19 01:01:00,10439,I don't know how the Toyo Celcius are but if they're anywhere near as good as their Open Country CT tires you can't go wrong with them.
989031,huzzsaba,2016-12-19 01:09:00,884,"I am kind of leaning towards the yokohama geolandar g015.  I'm assuming folks with pickup trucks would prefer this tire since it looks pretty beefy . For the most part, the limited reviews shows its a pretty good tire.   https://www.yokohamatire.com/tires/detail/geolandar_a_t_g015"
989032,DRIFTER_016,2016-12-19 01:13:00,10439,Don't forget to check out Cooper tires too. I used their snows on all of my Civics and it would go through a foot of fresh snow no problem.
989034,Old Ironmaker,2016-12-19 01:23:00,8243,"I have Coopers on the Silverado, great tires, very aggressive tread and no road noise other than normal. Got out of a 5' high drift last year to test the tires put it in 4 low, no problem. Made a U turn on a beach and found myself buried to the axles, that was not a test. I thought for sure I would need a tow but again hopped right out. They are not winter rated."
989036,Raf,2016-12-19 01:35:00,3495,"the geolanders are not an all-weather tire, they are an all terrain tire that happens to have a snowflake rating as well and thus satisfy the insurance discount.  goodyear duratracs are another tire that fall into this category.  all terrain (and all weather, for that matter) tires will never be as good as a dedicated snows but should be 'good enough'.  personally, i run an all-terrain tires spring, summer and fall and dedicated snows in the winter on my grand cherokee.  while i havent tried the all-weather tires, i don't like the idea of compromising.  plus having two sets of wheel/tire combos makes all terrains last longer."
