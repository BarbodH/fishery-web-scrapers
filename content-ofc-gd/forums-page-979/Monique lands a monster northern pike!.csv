233206,Mike the Pike,2008-07-27 00:07:00,3421,TJ your such a tease I really thought she caught something fatter than the last critter.
233246,kickingfrog,2008-07-27 02:31:00,8333,Those little suckers combined with some trebles scare me more than the big ones.

233409,tjsa,2008-07-27 22:13:00,1578,"the video was great, but I trumped Monique Saturday.  Caught a pike only 7 inches long, felt a bite, set the hook, nothing. Decided to check for weeds possibly, and the nightcrawler situation, still anything left on the harness? ,.....................ummmmmmmmmmmmmm, yah, gots a fish, dragging it on the worm harness. Good thing I checked as I did not feel anything unusual trolling, I would probably have drowned that poor little pike, it was the same size as the worm harness,"
240083,MelPiker,2008-08-15 20:14:00,3,What a Monster!
