River in the French below these is up 3 feet over 10 days ago. I have no idea why this puts the fishing off so much, but it did. Five days of fishing produced less than 10 pike and one walleye. Not even a muskie sighting. Only saving grace were the bass, which, while not going crazy, at least produced a few fish the first 4 days, and probably 30 or so the last day where we fished in rapids. Our results were consistent with the rest of the lodge's fisherman all week. Anyone else fish the French also last week or so?  Anyone have any idea what puts the fish off so under these conditions, and where they go?"
240162,Rich Clemens,2008-08-16 01:13:00,3131,Man that ain't good news.   Sorry about your bad luck.  I sure hope things improve in bit as I'm leaving for the French in 3 weeks.
240215,bigcreekdad,2008-08-16 13:00:00,546,"We fished deep and shallow......nada!  Rich ....I might be going up again week of the 13th......where are you going to be fishing? Even if water is still high by then, it would seem the fish would be accustomed to it by then."
240217,Greencoachdog,2008-08-16 13:17:00,8163,"When the water is high, some fish (like Bass) move up onto the flooded shoreline to feed on the flooded terrestials."
240220,Rich Clemens,2008-08-16 13:34:00,3131,  We're pullinng in to Wolseley on Sept. 6 and leaving on the 13th.   Guess we'll miss each other this year ... again.   Last year we swung down around Crane's to see if your boat was in dock ... nada.  We'll be at Rainbow Camp the week after and planning on running up to Lakair Friday the 19th to meet and greet with those attending the fall OFC GTG.
