240145,Dutch,2008-08-15 23:36:00,831,"What were your top 5 considerations when purchasing (or when you bought) a new or used boat?  The length/beam, draft, HP rating (speed), ride comfort, set-up, price, make/model, rivited vs. welded, livewell size etc. etc. - feel free to add to the list  Right now mine are (in no particular order):  1) Boat configuration (i.e. deep V) 2) Length/Beam 3) Rivited construction 4) Ride comfort 5) HP rating/Speed  What are your top 5?"
240146,forrest,2008-08-15 23:38:00,1032,1) weight 2) warranty 3) 4 stroke 4) length 5) durability
240147,Raf,2008-08-15 23:57:00,3495,"cost aluminum deep v tiller 15-17' 4 stroke at or near max hp for boat can i clamp my downeasters on?  equip ie. trolling motor, graph, etc can be added later and is secondary."
240149,mikeh,2008-08-15 23:58:00,824,"I have a bass boat now that I bought in the states  1...I wanted lots of storage compartments 2...not an under powered boat 3...bought a good name brand (skeeter)(yamaha) 4...tried to buy as new as possible (1999) 5...wanted 18 foot , figured a 21 foot with a 225 would be too hard on gas  now with the gas prices a 4 stroke or direct fuel injection motor is definately the way to go, wish I knew the gas prices were going to go up so fast."
240152,Mr. Follow,2008-08-16 00:04:00,34,When Buying my Boat I don't think I had 5 things to consider I choose a boat that i felt suit my needs and most bang for my buck.
240156,jwl,2008-08-16 00:32:00,1056,"we picked ours for a few reasons  One..of course was fishing  go figure, so I wanted a decent layout for that, came equipped with a bowmount,and fish finder, livewell,rod holders and storage space...seats can move to bow for comfort when using the bowmount, and also can move to back for more fishing room.  has a pretty good lifetime warranty on hull, as well as all decking.  is fast enough for goofing around with the kids tubing ect..or just ripping around the lake.  comfy seats makes for some nice touring around on the water with the wife and kids.  was an all around not bad package deal...plus a few extras, to make a pretty quality set-up for the money purchased brand new out of the box in 2003.  did I mention...suits my fishing needs well  ,great for the lake at my trailer, excellent boat for the Niagara River,not the biggest boat for the big lakes but then again if there's a small craft warning, the guys in the 17-18 footers are coming in too  .  Total package after upgrades came in at about 15 G's when all was said and done"
240185,vance,2008-08-16 03:35:00,719,Looked at a lot of boats and features and the key one was would it FIT in the garage!!!   vance
240197,modny,2008-08-16 11:00:00,502,"i dont understand why they put carpet in fishing boats.  doesn't make sense to me.. ur boat will smell like a fish cleaning hut!  i've been looking at the 20 foot lowe, alumacraft and polar craf center consol jon boats  i like to run skinny water, fish walleye, rivers, etc etc    boat has to be wide ( 78- 96"" beam or more preferrably) i like to put the biggest motor a boat can have on it ( u dont always have to run it full out) its bettertha underpowered. semi v or mod V hull center consol or tiller set up able to put a bimini on her if need be livewell(s) large in hull gas tank weight can't be too much has to have deep gunnels"
240198,cranks bait,2008-08-16 11:02:00,721,"Storage user space (casting deck, seating) comfort for the wife and other guests. handle of some tough water, but also easy for the small lakes towability will it fit in my boat sling durability two stroke accessories are an after thought.  package deals are usualy ""just"" enough. space to move around  I spend several months trying to figure out what I wanted.  I have ordered one, but will still like the other as well.  I spend a lot of time in my boat.  It has to be comfortable for an eleven hour day on the water.  Sitting up straight, no cramping of legs.  room to move."
240199,cranks bait,2008-08-16 11:06:00,721, I too took this into consideration.  My new boat has a vinyl main floor and carpet decks.  As soon as I get into my boat I am barefoot.  It get's really hot and not as comfortable standing all day.  The carpet gives a good cushion and keeps the singing heat off the feet.
240207,Rich Clemens,2008-08-16 11:44:00,3131,I guess for my last purchase.  1).  How does it fit the budget. 2).  Dimentions.   (Length / Beam). 3).  Storage Capacity. 4).  Patsy wanted a boat with a full windshield.  (Sure thing honey ... let's go look for a new one). 5).  What's a tiller ? 6).  How many marshmellows can I fit in the bait bucket ?  Ok - So I only gave 4.
