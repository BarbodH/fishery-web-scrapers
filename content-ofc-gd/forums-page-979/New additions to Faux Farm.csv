239815,Daplumma,2008-08-14 21:47:00,1961,"Saturday morning we loaded up the truck and went to pick up some Lamancha mix goats.The ears are supposed to be like that.They should get to 100 lbs or so when full grown.We call them chipper and shredder because they will eat anything.  Last week I was working a a customers house and commented on the old Kawasaki in the garage.He said it was his sons and was for sale.A couple of days later I called the son and he said he wanted $500 for it.Art said he would go in half on it so Sunday we picked it up.I know I dont need a bike but I like the old KZ bikes.This one is a 1979,I am sure some of y'all geezers have had one of these.  Joe"

239850,Becky,2008-08-15 00:03:00,10,"Sorry folks, but Joe's got it wrong. Their names are Wendy and Casper and they are really cute little things. We're tempted to put wings on them and call them dragons. My in-laws are training them to walk on a leash.  Becky  PS: I'm off to Wyoming for a week, so please keep an eye on Joe for me."
