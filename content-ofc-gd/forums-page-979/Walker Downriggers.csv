This is my third season with them and I was fishing Simcoe in a downpour, using the riggers for the first time in a heavy rain.  When I pulled a rod out the holder, the metal tube flew out of the bottom section & into the lake.  The other three tubes were all loose in the rod holders, I didn't know whether they were originally supposed to be glued or held in place by friction.   All the rain that day supplied just enough lubrication to overcome the friction between the metal tube and the plastic base.  About 2 hours later, I was pulling up for a hit, forgot the tubes were loose and guess what ...another flying rod holder.  After giving the idiot (me) a colourful dressing-down, I released the little shaker and gave up for the day.  When I get the replacements, they will be securely siliconed in place.  If you own Walkers, be sure to check the tubes - they are built the same on all models.  (Otherwise, the riggers peform without any problems.)  Big Daddy"
