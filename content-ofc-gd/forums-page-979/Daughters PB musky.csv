239470,Handlebarz,2008-08-13 19:50:00,3790,"Well over the weekend Muskies Canada had the 25th family outing even with all the rain and cool nights we had a blast it was great to get out with everyone again. This event is all about the kids and my kids had a blast My daughter took first place with her 2nd musky of the weekend it was a nice looking 42""er she had no help from mom to bring this one in I was shocked as with her other musky she wanted help not this one she even guided it into the net like a pro. Ron was there to see it first hand and took some great shots here is the best one.  "
