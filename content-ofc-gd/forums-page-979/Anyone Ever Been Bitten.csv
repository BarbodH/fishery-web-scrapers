239586,ccmtcanada,2008-08-14 02:05:00,7971," Glad to hear that you went in and are getting treated.  Bly was in to see a Dr after the headaches started....relatively early compared to you by the sounds of it.  Those hobos are nasty...she has about a 1"" scar left as a reminder.  She didn't need the intravenous stuff....  Anyhow....hopefully you'll have a speedy recovery!  Thanks for the update."
239590,Greencoachdog,2008-08-14 02:09:00,8163, Holy Hog Snot Batman!!!   ... another inch or two in a certain direction and the could treated the cause but left the symptoms (swelling) Eh!!!   Time to set off some bug bombs in the house!!!

239643,Musky or Specks,2008-08-14 12:03:00,2710,Mine looked very similar to the one on the guys shoulder blade only twice the size and 3 inches below my belly button.

239717,Garyv,2008-08-14 14:46:00,547,Post pulled one above beat me !
239729,fishnsled,2008-08-14 16:09:00,3520,Speedy recovery.  Good thing you went to the doctors.
239900,BabyHerc,2008-08-15 02:07:00,285,We certainly do have brown recluses here in Ontario.
239993,douG,2008-08-15 15:18:00,2693,"Wikipedia doesn't think so, nor does http://www.brownreclusespider.org/, or http://www.healthyontario.com/ConditionDet...?disease_id=297.  "
240121,Radnine,2008-08-15 22:27:00,1538,"While I have not been bitten by a Hobo Spider, I have been bitten by an actual Hobo. And I'm here to tell you that that's no picnic!!"
240169,Musky or Specks,2008-08-16 01:46:00,2710,"The thing to remember about a spiders range is a certain times of the year it is very fluid. They can easily be transported and survive for a season or two in ontario before our winters kill them. My treatment is still ongoing, my rash has subsided but the bite and swelling are still there. Now the thing itches worse then any mosquito bite. I git sent home from work yesrerday because they didnt want me working with a shunt in my wrist so after my IV first thing this morning I removed the shunt and will endure daily IV injection so I can keep on mling the DOH RAY ME."
240180,Tybo,2008-08-16 02:52:00,1373,They can definately be transported.  My grandfather worked at a grocery store when he was younger and got bitten by a banana spider while unloading the bananas from the boxes.  Nearly killed him!  Joey
240184,douG,2008-08-16 03:19:00,2693,You gotta accept personal testimonials.  Hope  yer wound heals soon.
240210,Greencoachdog,2008-08-16 12:18:00,8163,"Here's a paragraph I found on a page for the Hobo Spider:  For years there have been numerous reports of spider bites in the Northwest United States in which the Brown Recluse Spider was blamed, despite the fact that they reside in the Mid-Southern to Southeast United States.  Brown Recluse Spiders have bite effects and symptoms that are nearly identical to Hobo Spiders.  Because the Brown Recluse Spider is known more throughout the general population, they had been, and still are today, wrongfully accused of the insidious effects of Hobo Spider bites.  Our traps are recommended for Brown Recluse Spiders as well.  Here's the link to the page for the traps:  http://www.hobospider.com/info/index.html   Anything that wears it's genetalia on it's face has got to be nasty!!!"
240245,Mattones,2008-08-16 16:04:00,587,I worked with a guy at the Construction site in Bronte.  One morning he put his sock on something pinched him he said he figured it was just a wood chip so he went to work. around lunch time his foot was killing him so he took it off and his foot was like a balloon. Didn't see him for a few weeks. He came back with a limp. sad.  I am glad your doing okay now MOS.
239221,Musky or Specks,2008-08-13 03:13:00,2710,The other night while I was sleeping something bit me at about 2am. It hurt like a dude snd its now two days later and it disgusting. Its swollen up and purple and leaks bloody puss with black bits out of the puncture.( I beleive the black bits are coagualated blood.) I'd feel like a wuss if I went to the doctor for it. Ive been treating it with Peroxide and alchohol as well as taking Ibuprofen and antihistamines. Just wondering if anyone else has experienced ? We dont have black widows or brown recluses in the K-Dub but what other kind of spider in SW ontario could do this?

239229,Musky or Specks,2008-08-13 03:29:00,2710,Mine actually looks way worse than that
239230,danbo,2008-08-13 03:33:00,2646,Gagger!!..get going!! & quit Monkeying around!
239233,holdfast,2008-08-13 03:40:00,1813,YUKKKKKkk THEY LOOK LIKE THE VD PICTURES I WAS TORTURED TO SEE IN HIGHSCHOOL
239234,Joey,2008-08-13 03:47:00,9122,"I would go to the doctor, spider bites that get infected can be very serious.  The poison and infection can travel through your bloodstream and become toxic.  Not worth risking your life bud.  Get it checked out soon.  Google spider bites and you'll see.  Joey"
239247,Greencoachdog,2008-08-13 09:49:00,8163,I thought you were supposed to be an intelligent human being? Don't you know the longer you leave something like that untreated the worse it will get and the longer it will take to heal? Not to mention complications like blood poisoning and tissue loss!  Seek medical attention today!!!
239256,cpguy29,2008-08-13 11:06:00,148,Yep. My leg swelled up big time. Finnally had to go to doctor for antibodies.
239259,Rich,2008-08-13 11:06:00,3927,People can have allergies to particular types of spider bites. Get it checked out.
239260,modny,2008-08-13 11:08:00,502,"POST PICS POST PICS POST PICS   my old man was bit years ago, it was all swollen just like urs, then years later it turned into a cancerous tumor which needed to be removed.  maybe get that checked out..  on the bright side, dipping your senko into the puss gives it an aroma that fish cant resist. kinda like gulp!"
239267,ccmtcanada,2008-08-13 11:20:00,7971,"Bly was bitten by a Hobo spider before.  It got pretty nasty, infected and painful.  Ended up on some good drugs to get rid of the infection, but it didn't heal for quite some time.  Hobo spiders are found in Ontario....do a search on pics of these kinds of bites on google....they can get quite nasty.  Go to the doctor..."
239268,ccmtcanada,2008-08-13 11:20:00,7971,"Oh yeah....they prefer dark areas like crawl spaces, gloves and bedding."
239269,Bly,2008-08-13 11:21:00,1556,"I was bitten by a Hobo spider while sleeping one night.  Wasn't sure what it was so like you, treated it at home.  The bite area continued to grow and the surrounding tissue only got redder, more tender and more swollen.   Treatment was heavy antibiotics and thankfully I only have a small scar, could have been much worse."
239271,Fisherman,2008-08-13 11:22:00,7201,"You believe you may not have any Black Widow spiders in that area, but don't believe everything.  Black Widows populate Bruce County, not that far away and we do have them in the Borden/Lisle area.  A couple have been caught and placed in jars for the troops to see. Being a wuss can cost you."
239294,Musky or Specks,2008-08-13 12:20:00,2710,Okay Im convinced and its still super painful. Im going to the clinic after work
239309,mbac31,2008-08-13 12:44:00,904,Never been bitten by a spider however got bitten by a Scorpion a few years back. The spidr bites I think can turn very infectious usually. Go get it looked after.
239317,troutologist,2008-08-13 13:13:00,951,Definitely black widows in KW. Not alot but they are around
239353,Zamboni,2008-08-13 14:30:00,235,"Lay off the peroxide, when the baby spiders hatch and come out from under your skin their gonna be angry."
239465,lunkerbasshunter,2008-08-13 19:43:00,2585,"i have been biten, and it was a big gross bumb that i had to get removed by surgery.  It came back from the lab as being infected from a spider bite.  It is not fun and it left me a scar on my arm.  Its not fun if you don't get it taken care of.  cheers!"
239518,forrest,2008-08-13 22:36:00,1032,"I got bit by a spider and had a bad reaction once.  The infected area was about 6 inches in diameter, was raw, itched like crazy and continually grew a thin translucent scab over it.  This lasted for 2 weeks and ruined a fishing trip for me.  Very unpleasant.  Mine was way worse than that pic too.  See a doctor.  Now.  forrest"
239526,Dozer,2008-08-13 22:55:00,896,"My dad got bit once up in Barry's Bay.  He's got this old mentality that he'll be okay.  A red line starting going up his body towards his heart.  Once it passed ""ramala -da -ding - dong"" things got serious... went to the hospital and was under IV and all these drugs for two weeks.  Venom/poison isn't fun stuff to deal with."
239567,Cookslav,2008-08-14 01:12:00,1457,"I've actually seen a Black widow in Bruce county...sauble beach to be Exsact. My Mother found it and FREAKED OUT!!!  So we all came to see it before Dad..errr...well lets just say he disposed of the potential issue. Rare, but yup they are around.  Now if they are in K-dub...I'm out!  But now you GOTTA post the Findings when you get treatment..inquireing minds want to know But My bets on a Hobbo spider, it fits the M.O.  My Daughter was bit by one on her back....she was playing ""under"" the deck, and got tagged. She has a massive welt, that wept, and the sore was raw and weepy for a week after the fact, and bust blood vessles all around the site. The doctor perscribed her a cream, and said if it gets worse, to come back but that was it. Still has the scar, but it healed up in about 2 weeks."
239572,ccmtcanada,2008-08-14 01:24:00,7971,Any update on the Dr visit?
239581,Greencoachdog,2008-08-14 01:56:00,8163,"It wasn't a Black Widow bite, theirs is a neurotoxin that affects the central nervous system... with symptoms of labored breathing and convulsive like tremors. Drop for drop, the Black Widow venom is one of the most poisonous venoms known to man.  This sounds more like a necrotic type venom that disolves the flesh, but may just be an allergic reaction to a milder type venom.  I have an allergic reaction to Tick bites with pretty much the same symptoms, nothing else bothers me... but a Tick bite will give me fits and send me running to the doctor!"
239582,Musky or Specks,2008-08-14 01:59:00,2710,I want to thank everyone who convinced me to go to the doctor. A good call. I now have a shunt installed in my hand and will be receiving daily intrvenous treatments as well as daily professional changings of my dressing. Hobo spider bite was the diagnosis. I go back in three days and they will decide whether to go to a stronger antibiotic. Regardless it looks like I will have a small scar. Funny thing was all the doctors and nurses in the hospital kept coming in wanting to see the bite because none of them had ever seen one before. So I was like a temporary teaching exhibit for the staff. Kind of embarassing really when the bite is just above your pubis.
