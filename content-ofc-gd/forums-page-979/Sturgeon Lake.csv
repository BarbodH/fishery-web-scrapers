Have caught eyes drifting off the weed edges in these areas as well as fishing the various shoals and humps around the lake.  If I had a map in front of me I could give you more details.  I know Big Cliff and Ecmilly live on the lake, hopefully they can give you additional information.  It is a great lake to fish, have fun and good luck ...........  Tom"

240151,FishingInTheDark,2008-08-16 00:03:00,25,you should check out the Lindsay River that goes up to the Lindsay lock. Its about half way between each end of the lake. theres a lot of bass and musky. you might even get lucky and catch something on a top water. good luck
