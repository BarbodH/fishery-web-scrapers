239249,nancur373,2008-08-13 10:05:00,1211,I was looking at those o-ring rigs for the senkos at BPS and got to thinking I could make that myself. Anyone know what size the o-rings are?
239349,blarg,2008-08-13 14:28:00,289,"i looked around for some but i could only find either too loose or too small, i read online that you can use small elastics that women use in thier hair, i twist them on to themselves and open it with my plaiers and pull the senko through, it worked really well."
239358,dannyboy,2008-08-13 14:47:00,367,Check here  Dan
239359,BillM,2008-08-13 14:47:00,17367,I bet the elastics I used to use in my braces a LONG time ago would be perfect for this.  Stop by your local orthodontist and say your kid ran out
239870,nancur373,2008-08-15 00:49:00,1211,thanks Dan
239887,oncogene,2008-08-15 01:44:00,154,"I just ordered and received a bag of o-rings from Ebay..... $2 for 100, plus $2 shipping, as I mentioned in the other post Dan linked.  These are just a hair, barely, smaller than the o-rings that come with the BPS o-ring tools, but fit just fine. 100 of them... should last me 2-3 years..."
239889,nancur373,2008-08-15 01:52:00,1211,What size o-rings were they?
239891,PatrickGG,2008-08-15 01:54:00,562,"Sounds interesting, i wacky rig alot how does this O-Ring Rig work?"
239893,PatrickGG,2008-08-15 01:57:00,562,Never Mind i just googled it.
239894,nancur373,2008-08-15 01:58:00,1211,Slide thr o-ring over the worm to the middle. then just put your hook behind the o-ring as opposed to throught the worm.
239895,oncogene,2008-08-15 01:58:00,154," 1-size fit all I guess?  I'm using 5"" senkos."
