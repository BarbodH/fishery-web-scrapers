240055,addy79,2008-08-15 18:33:00,573,"any of you seen this commercial? just wonder if anyone has picked one up and if so, how did it work out for you?"
240057,GBW,2008-08-15 18:39:00,8460,"Is that the one before the Pancake Puffs and after the Hercules Hook? Seen it, don't have one and not going to have one so I cannot say if it works.  I'm sure you can find something else like it to hook over the rod in the same way to try it out, sort of..."
240060,bbog,2008-08-15 18:49:00,665,"You can fashion up your own in less time than it takes to pick-up the phone and order. Don't know if it actually works but hard to imagine anyone would need to ""buy"" one."
240061,danbo,2008-08-15 18:50:00,2646,If it takes half an hour on TV to tell you how great it is...it ain't.
240062,bassjnkie,2008-08-15 18:51:00,1101,"Didn't buy one but I made one with a piece of coat handger and rubber tubing. I also made that auto hook setter rod holder that Cabelas sells. Do you remeber the auto hook setter tip up that bass pro sells for ice fishing, made one. As you can see all these gimics can be made with house hold items.  Back on topic, my version of the tail dancer works as good, if not better than the original. Yes, it actually works but when you set the hook, you got to quickly remove the line from the gizmo, or else you will get crazy line tangles. oh, ya, only works with spinning reels, but not spincast or bait casters."
240064,addy79,2008-08-15 18:55:00,573,"thats what i figured...fish hits n it all goes to hell  just curious, no intentions of buying one"
240129,Garyv,2008-08-15 22:39:00,547,My wife bought them for me.  All I can say is it does what they say it will but don't know what the fish think!!!!
240144,cpguy29,2008-08-15 23:30:00,148,You have to unhook your line from it when fighting a fish. What a joke!
240288,BIG JIM,2008-08-16 19:42:00,11,"I invented that by accident three winters back when I got lazy   near the end of the day and tried to use a 2500 Symetre on a 27"" HT ice fishing rod on Lake of the Woods while fishing with Gord Pyzer...who incidently should have landed at Great Bear Lake right about...... NOW...no guff, he left this morning from Winterpeg...  Anyway...If the reel is to big for the rod it does exactly the same thing as it changes the angle from the bail to the stripper guide on the rod and creates the most aggrivating bouncing sensation ever!!!    .  BIG JIM...hangin' in"
