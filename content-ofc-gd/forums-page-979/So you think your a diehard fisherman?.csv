239897,BabyHerc,2008-08-15 02:02:00,285,Does anyone else find it odd that the wife is soooooo happy that her husband is dead??
239956,blaque,2008-08-15 12:43:00,2419," Yeah , the joy in their faces over using a dead family member as fish food just oozes weirdness and disfunction!!!"
239970,Anton Kanagasuntheri,2008-08-15 13:46:00,160,I gues there is no law agianst what you do with your left overs? is there?
240027,Rich,2008-08-15 17:00:00,3927,There is in Canada now from what I hear. Ashes can't be spread on public waterways without a permit.
240053,wolfville,2008-08-15 18:16:00,396,I respect his will. I'm sure he is happy now.
240073,jwl,2008-08-15 19:27:00,1056,"about 7 years ago actually, we spread the ashes of my departed step-dad in the lake up at my trailer, in his favorite top water bass spot"
240075,Rizzo,2008-08-15 19:29:00,4754,"I didn't know how I could combine my job (funeral director) with my hobby (fishing) until I read that article, thanks for the info!"
240078,MelPiker,2008-08-15 19:36:00,3,WOW... fish food.  How Bizare
240216,Rich,2008-08-16 13:10:00,3927,I wonder if they caught anything in that spot?
240324,silvio,2008-08-16 23:17:00,433,So many happy people this is odd. Nice to see someone who loves fishing so much... but that smile on his wife’s face might have something to do with all the times he left her home alone!!! so to all my fishing partners do not let your wife feed you to the fish no matter how much you love fishing because every time she tosses out a ball of bait she’s saying member when you left me alone or remembering anytime you chooses fishing over her (almost always).
240436,Dozer,2008-08-17 09:24:00,896,They second family photo there looks like the people are employees of a company that just developed some new fishing bait.  They're just missing the product name in the front ... creepy ...
240443,Roy,2008-08-17 10:43:00,13728,I buried my brother's ashes in Caesarea in '76. I've never fished the bog since.
