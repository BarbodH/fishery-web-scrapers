239855,mbac31,2008-08-15 00:10:00,904,I currently have a 2 1/2 year old Minnkota 101 Bowmount with a 1 year old Minnkota Charger. I was looking to see if someone would trade for a 24 Volt system. Willing to throw in the extra battery as well. This motor and system is awesome but to much motor fo my Aluminum boat. I really dont nhave the room for the extra battery either. I will have it serviced at Minnkota if need be. I think everything is still under warranty. Not sure. I would rather go back to a 24 volt system. I never use the full system anyways and would rather gain back the room.
