240247,JoshS,2008-08-16 16:15:00,729,Just made the last minute decision to rent a boat for the aft.  Gorski's marina rents them but for $20 an hour!  Does anyone know a cheap place to rent a boat on scugog?  I guess any cheap boat rentals close to TO would be valuable info.

240269,JoshS,2008-08-16 18:29:00,729,Thank you very much.  I'm on my way lol.  I couldn't sit at home any longer on this beauty day so I'm gonna do a few hours on the bog and then maybe see whats happening on the piers.  good day
240271,BabyHerc,2008-08-16 18:30:00,285,"Is Westshore the one right beside the Gov. dock?  If so, they charge by the hour, 12 or 13 bucks if I recall correctly.  I went out solo in July, gunned it to a spot I researched earlier, caught an 8lb muskie, and gunned it back.  Round trip: 2 hours."
240289,johnnyb,2008-08-16 19:49:00,3413,"Nope...not the one by the gov't dock....I think that's Island Marine...they're okay, from what I've heard...just never got around to renting from 'em.   Never had a problem at Westshore...they're on the uh...west shore of the lake."
