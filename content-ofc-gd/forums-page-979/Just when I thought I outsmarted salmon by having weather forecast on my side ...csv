240335,tdotfisherman,2008-08-17 00:18:00,317,"None spotted yet in my favourite eastern trib.. I'll try again in September.. for now though, G-Bay Muskie to focus on.."
238496,Guest Fishing For Life,2008-08-11 01:24:00,0,"Ok, stop laughing at me now, please  I thought I was being smart this year ... to start fishing salmon earlier than before especially when I thought this cold front could send a signal to them that ... It is time to move into the river!  As you can imagine .. I went out last night to ""workout ""my arms & wrists @ ""Credit River Facility"" from 8:00pm to 9:00am this morning to the point I almost fell asleep, haha  Yep, Skunked is all I got, sigh  Anyone else tried it this weekend? What other piers around GTA did you guys do?"
238523,StrealHeader,2008-08-11 03:32:00,56,Not even a goby?
238524,Guest Fishing For Life,2008-08-11 03:33:00,0,Nope  I dont think Goby can get up to the speed of my spoons ..  hah
238525,StrealHeader,2008-08-11 03:42:00,56,I couldnt keep them off my roes!
238526,silvio,2008-08-11 03:56:00,433,Give it some more time yes its cold and has rained alott but the time has not come yet.
238559,Guest Fishing For Life,2008-08-11 11:33:00,0,Not time yet? .... how long do we have to wait?
238612,StrealHeader,2008-08-11 13:49:00,56,Sept and Oct for any real numbers
238648,bbnotty,2008-08-11 15:33:00,93,"fishing for life, not worth that much time out there yet. the time will come, early sept. there may be good numbers moving in. All you will be doing now is washing your spoons and maybe feeding the rocks a few too.  B"
238670,fishnpro,2008-08-11 16:56:00,93,"I was at bronte last night and hammered 211 Chinook all on roe....I think everyone should go to bronte, thats where all the fish are"
238705,ccmtcanada,2008-08-11 18:25:00,7971,"It may be a bit early, but keep on trying.  It'll take an extended period of cool weather before they start to head closer to shore.  I've got my eyes on the first few weeks of September to start trying."
238768,MuddyWater,2008-08-11 22:37:00,218,their has been scatterd amounts in the streams my way most come in and poke around and take back off some are dead from the warmth this is called natural selection lol
238800,fishindevil,2008-08-11 23:58:00,6254,"Well guys there have even been a few fish in some of the tribs already !!! and they have been jumping just outside the harbor walls!!!! some are black and ready to run very soon,stay ready to go!!!! the tribs are sending vast amounts of current and a nice brown mudline up to 1 mile out into lake o!!! so trust me they are closer than you think!!! the rain is fooling them into being an early run"
238802,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-08-12 00:02:00,0,Talk about hard core. Fished the entire night without sleep?? Sorry to hear it didn't pay off... Maybe in a few weeks it will be better. Good luck.
239215,Guest Fishing For Life,2008-08-13 02:56:00,0,"Well .. well, well ...  Attempt #2 last night .. FAILED"
239237,fishnpro,2008-08-13 04:14:00,93,"Don't get discouraged Fishing For Life, I have gone out many times in the past and not caught a thing. Believe me, when it comes to early season Chinooks you have to hit the right day and when you do you`ll be lucky if your arms don't fall off by the time you leave. It takes a lot of patients but it pays off. Ill be out all night this Friday trying to hook into another silver bullet. Good Luck and dont give up!!   -Fishnpro"
239238,bassfighter,2008-08-13 04:30:00,366,"I wasted my time for 4 hours chugging spoon like a crazy desperate dud at Port Hope yesterday, and there was no one on site before 5:00pm. By 9:30pm. 10 people showed up to catch what? Maybe their line were dirty from storage and need to wash it.  Few anglers submitted exagerated report at other board as well and some of us got sucked into it. TOO EARLY FOR SALMON FISHING! Stay home and save your gas, we got burned so others do not make the same mistakes. Wait at least two more weeks. It is still Bass and walleye season  I did hear the story that there was a mini run last week, TWO SALMON Who were suicidal fish entered Ganny at port Hope, and everyone tried to catch it. The only way to catch the two is to use a dynamite , to cover the entire Pier and Bay."
239298,Marko,2008-08-13 12:24:00,854," Have you even seen any jump around? Maybe you should try walking up the creek of the trib you are fishing and look for them, if you see some at least you`ll know some of the fish is there. I personally think its still to early."
239422,fishnpro,2008-08-13 17:28:00,93,I will waste every last penny i have to go out and catch that 1 chinny because it beats staying in the house all day. Personally I fish at least 5 times a week and I have no problem going out and washing off all my spoons and rapalas. Oh and just let you guys know iv already hooked 2 fish in the creeks and believe me they weren't the only 2 there.
239487,Guest Fishing For Life,2008-08-13 20:15:00,0,Also forgot to mention I lost two 3/4 oz little cleo spoons ... sigh
239543,salmon,2008-08-13 23:42:00,334," Full Moon Friday, you know what that means.....  Jose"
239574,ccmtcanada,2008-08-14 01:28:00,7971, Don't get discouraged!  I lost a lot more than 2 last year....LOL.  I've been stocking up on cleos over the past few weeks to prepare.
239577,CLofchik,2008-08-14 01:37:00,854,"East tribs usually get fish earlier than the west......nudge nudge hint hint.  Still wayyyy too early for reliable #'s, especially with the funky weather we've gotten lately.  I'm still blanked on west tribs, been going out 3-4 times every week since late July.  This is the latest I've gone without hooking a king, the weather (and especially rain) have really screwed the fishing.  I'm of the opinion that August fish follow temps, September fish follow flow.  All this rain we've gotten, and those huge mudlines, have dumped ALOT of warm trib water into the harbours, keeping the fish offshore.  My earliest chinook I've caught came a few years ago on August 2nd off Bronte, at 3pm, 20+ degrees on a warm bright sunny summer afternoon.  But there had been a good N wind and the surface temps were 62 degrees in the harbour."
239673,BITEME,2008-08-14 13:07:00,1969,that just means your fishing for them the right way you have to pay dues to the salmon gods
239946,Guest Fishing For Life,2008-08-15 11:12:00,0,Skunke #3 now .. and lost another 2 Cleo ...  At this rate of losing Cleos ... I need to find a 2nd job ...  Has anyone had any success?
239978,Guest chopchop,2008-08-15 14:14:00,0,"Was out over a mile last night, water was over 70 degrees on top and the salmon were there, hugging the bottom. As others have mentioned, will be a while yet for the main runs begin. Looks like warmer weather on the horizon as well.  However, this will not stop the odd fish from trying to get in early, but this will not be consistent.  CC"
