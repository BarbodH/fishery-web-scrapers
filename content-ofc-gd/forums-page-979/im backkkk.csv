236023,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-08-04 13:34:00,0,Great Report. Nipissing is a great lake to fish. Nice largie. They were introduced to cater to the Americans. But I don't think they were too successful. But there are some good ones around still. Thanks for sharing.  If you wanted bigger fish you should have tried lures around the shore early morning late evening.
236114,lunkerbasshunter,2008-08-04 18:56:00,2585,"nipissing can be tough like that sometimes.  Patience sure pays off on that lake.  what worked one minute may not work the next, its a strange lake.  I find that even the slighest change like a 1 degree change in tempature can turn the fish off or turn them into a feeding frenzy.  What keeps me coming back to that lake is the chance at a feedy frenzy.  When they are on it can be the best lake in southern ontario.  Cheers!"
236129,BillM,2008-08-04 20:03:00,17367,Nipissing is southern Ontario?  Good report LA!  Seems like patience paid off.
236134,Musky or Specks,2008-08-04 20:14:00,2710,Anything below HWY 17 is Southern Ontario there is a reason scale changes on your map when you get to the northern ontario part.
236148,BillM,2008-08-04 21:02:00,17367,"Well #$%# on me   I guess I am used to anything above Barrie and below Sudbury being referred to as Central Ontario, lol"
