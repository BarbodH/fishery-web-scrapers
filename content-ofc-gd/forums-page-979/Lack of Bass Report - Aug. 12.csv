239564,JustinHoffman,2008-08-14 01:02:00,482,"Hello All,  Headed out on the water with my bud Tim yesterday. High hopes as we launched at 9am...but sadly, it just wasn't to be.  Worked the water hard for 8 hours - pads, slop, wood, flats - but came up virtually empty-handed.  Final tally at the end of the day was two largies - one each!  If anything, it was a humbling experience.  Tim with a decent pike - huge head but very skinny body..    My one largie of the day. Can't complain I guess, as it was my biggest of the season thus far....4lbs 7oz. This girl was short but built like a girthy freight train..Came on a topwater frog.    The release shot..    Here's looking forward to better co-operation from the fish next time...lol!  Good Fishing,  Justin"
239568,e-z-out,2008-08-14 01:12:00,1052,The last few times i've been out i've run into the same problem. Yes them topwater frogs work so good. That Pikes head was huge damn great pics and report better luck next time. 9am starts are a bit late if you ask me 5 and 6am starts work the best just my to cents
239601,Leecher,2008-08-14 02:36:00,7832,Great report and pics Justin  Real chunky one for sure  Thanks for sharing Leechman
239636,Victor,2008-08-14 11:21:00,1609,"O wow! It's rare to see a ""lack of bass"" report from you lol!  But it seems that the quality made up for it! Thanks for the report and pics!"
239639,scuro,2008-08-14 11:31:00,386,"I was beginning to think you were a FISHING MACHINE. It's good for the rest of us to see that even good fishermen have slow days. This type of report should help the rest of us not to get discouraged on the water. I just like to be out there and ""read"" the conditions. It helps me for the next time I am out."
239645,BillM,2008-08-14 12:12:00,17367,"Also had a tough night out on the Pool yesterday.  1 largie on a senko, the other a nice fish about 3lbs ona top water.   Dad got bit off by a huge pike...  This weather isn't helping the fishing at all..  We need a week of stable weather to get things sorted out again.,"
239648,Spiel,2008-08-14 12:19:00,9065,....All my fishing trips are a humbling experience.
239668,bucktail,2008-08-14 13:00:00,1857,"Nice largemouth! Last week my buddie and I had almost the same results, 2 good fish on Spro frogs and nothing much else.got me wondering as well. Maybe its this weird weather?"
239685,misfish,2008-08-14 13:35:00,29133,AHA you are a mortal after all. HAHAHAHA  Im sure you will get into them Justin. Great report as always. Thanks for sharing bud.
239687,Rich,2008-08-14 13:38:00,3927,"For some of us Justin, that would be an exceptionally good day.  Good on ya for working the water hard and finally being paid off. Decent pike too!"
239774,bassjnkie,2008-08-14 19:37:00,1101,Nice fish!! The release pic is awsome!!!!!!!!!!!!
239962,limeyangler,2008-08-15 12:55:00,5204,"great report! I have been very lucky this year and not had many days where i've had to work too hard, the walleye were tough at the beginning of the season for me, but the hardest day like you was rewarded with my PB!......my best humbling experiences tend to happen (but not exclusively) on the ice...so in about 4 and a half months i will take inspiration from your great post.  Having said that i'm taking my mum and dad out downrigging for lakers today....LOLOL.....might be taking inspiration from you a lot sooner than i wanted too!!!!  Thanks for sharing."
