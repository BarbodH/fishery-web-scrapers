Didn't get a lot of fishing in with the kid being under the weather, rain every day from Tuesday on, and the ever so consistant nagging from the Mother-in-Law who can't seem to do nothing for herself. (my apologies to all women, but this one is helpless). Lots of sunfish, pupmkinseed, perch and WGSF from the dock for the little ones. I caught a 1.5 - 2lb SMB from the dock one day who while I was lipping for a pic flicked so hard that it jumped right out of my hand before the camera snap. My wife laughrd her ass off. Did quite a bit of trolling with only 2 tiny pickeral and some WGSF to show for it. Didn't know the lake but go figure I found a nice little bay on the last day when me and the wife were out alone, with no 18month old to watch, which produced a little. We fished by an old beaver house for about an hour from 4-5pm. anchored. The wife landed a ton of sunfish, WGSF and a few small SMB. I managed 2 SMB @ 1lb 10oz at I think 15"" and one pike @ 24"" 3lb. Hope to get pics up by tomorrow. Oh btw my new-to-me boat I love. The 9.9 pushes her just fine for now. She got one leaky rivet which leaves about an inch of water in the back end after 12 hours sitting at the dock. Thanks to all those who gave me info about the lake.  Cheers,  Curt"
239166,e-z-out,2008-08-13 00:51:00,1052,It sounds like you had a good time to bad the Mother-in-Law gave you a hard time. Can't wait to see the pics Curt
239171,bbog,2008-08-13 01:01:00,665,Sounds like the MIL gave you a chance to get out alone with the wife so can't be all that bad??  Did you get a chance to fish some of the nearby lakes as mentioned by some of the members? I'd love to get back up to Restoule one day. My only trip there was about 10 years ago when I wasn't fishing yet.  Thanks for the report and I can't wait to see the pictures.
239172,nancur373,2008-08-13 01:05:00,1211,It was the wife's aunt that gave us the chance...lol

239866,nancur373,2008-08-15 00:36:00,1211,Yeah JohnnyB we had a great time. Would go back anytime. Wouldn't mind pairing up with another couple and rent a cottage on the other side of the lake.
239883,Raf,2008-08-15 01:38:00,3495,"priceless pics buddy.. looks like a vacation the whole family will remember - even the mil, she'll have a different story, of course."

240054,1leggedangler,2008-08-15 18:27:00,364,"Kids and KD!! Doesn't get any better than that. Love the pic of the both of you crashed out, little fella looks quite comfortable in the boat. Thanks for the report.  Cheers, 1leg"
240371,nancur373,2008-08-17 01:41:00,1211,"Yeah, he loved the boat. No problems at all."
240383,cram,2008-08-17 02:08:00,1733,"Restoule is a really tough lake.   Not sure if its because of the baitfish or whatever, but its one of the toughest lakes in ontario --- no doubt."
