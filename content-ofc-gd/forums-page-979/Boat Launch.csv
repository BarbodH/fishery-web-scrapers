240039,muskymike,2008-08-15 17:23:00,772,"there is lots, what lake?"
240043,FishingInTheDark,2008-08-15 17:32:00,25,"Any lake! Looking for new places to fish! Haha, I already no about the one on Lovesick, at Burleigh falls. And also the one on the River close to Lakefield."
240044,ecmilley,2008-08-15 17:34:00,2163,and i thought you needed advice on the best sandwiches for the boat other than that which lake you gonna target?
240045,FishingInTheDark,2008-08-15 17:44:00,25,"Upper/Lower Buckhorn or Stoney. I no for sure that theres a boat launch at the Lodge on highway 28, but it costs about $ 20.00 to launch.  Haha, Should probably change the spelling! Opse."
240077,Rizzo,2008-08-15 19:31:00,4754,balsam has a free launch. If you drive down the road there is a launch where you can put your boat right in the water
240079,e-z-out,2008-08-15 19:40:00,1052,Lower Buckhorn has a nice boat launch next to Lock 31
240106,workwear,2008-08-15 21:35:00,592, you are talking the one beside the canal?? caution...with the balsam free launch......been a wet summer...seen alot of vehicles get stuck in there......wonder why no one has ever thought of cementing it......
240112,Jer,2008-08-15 21:50:00,1426,"Probably the best public launch around is at the causeway on Chemong, west end across from Bridgenorth. Gives you access to the Tri-Lakes (Chemong, Upper Buckhorn, Pigeon, even Big Bald & Little Bald).  Large concrete ramp, lotsa free parking, small dock at the ramp."
240133,muskymike,2008-08-15 22:52:00,772,"Noggies Creek at the top of Pigeon as well, 5 minutes from Bobcaygeon"
240138,FishingInTheDark,2008-08-15 23:10:00,25,"Thanks   , can't wait to get out fishing tomorrow, hopefully I catch something."
