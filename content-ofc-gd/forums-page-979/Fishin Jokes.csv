If you're making love and you catch something, that's bad.  * Fish don't compare you to other fishermen neither. And don't want to know how many other fish you caught.  * In fishing you lie about the one that got away. In loving you lie about the one you caught.  * You can catch and release a fish, you don't have to lie, and promise to still be friends after you let it go.  * You don't necessarily have to change your line to keep catching fish.  * You can catch a fish on a 20-cent frozen squid. If you want to catch a woman you're talking dinner and a movie minimum.  * Fish don't mind if you fall asleep in the middle of fishing."
