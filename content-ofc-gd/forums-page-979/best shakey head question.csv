239744,JustinHoffman,2008-08-14 17:07:00,482,"Hey Mark,  Give the Title SHot ""Shaky"" Jig a try - made by Fin-tech. Comes in 1/16, 1/8, 3/16, and 1/4oz sizes. Also eight colours. Has the fully collapsible retainer system that holds your plastics solidly, yet allows easy and quick hook penetration.    And yes, the Chompers ""Dropshot"" Worm would work well with this system.  Good Fishing,  Justin"
239775,GoneFishin,2008-08-14 19:42:00,349,"I've done some searching around for ""shakey heads"" and I found these to be the best IMO. (although I haven't tried them cause they are hard to find!!) I like them because the head will sit flat on the bottom better then other jigs, so your worm will stand instead of sitting flat on the bottom.

239857,mbac31,2008-08-15 00:18:00,904,"I agree the spot remover ones are good as well as the Title shot ones to. I have found these to be working very well for me. http://www.tourneyjigs.com/shaky-head-jigs.htm  I would imagine that the Chompers would not work that well because of the profile, very short and stubby. I use various different styles. Worms work very well also."
239945,BabyHerc,2008-08-15 11:11:00,285,These get my vote as the best shakey jig.  Never a problem with a hookset.  http://stores.ebay.com/Bassdozer-Store_Jig...9QQftidZ2QQtZkm
