If they went here as a refugee or what ever excuse, how come they are being schooled and working a store abroad.  No doubt our taxes helped them to go back to their motherland.  As far as using the Canadian Citizen excuse for the government to intervene think about it.  There's probably hundreds of criminals with Canadian citizen papers out there ready to cost us financially.  Use that money for the real Canadians that are overseas doing their duty for this Country.  Another thing, except for the odd immigrant, how many do you really think would have the courage to take up arms for this country.  Haven't come across any except the odd reservist but usually they're there only for the money.  Immigration should go back to the way it used to be the way my Wifes parents came to this Country from Iraq.  1. Sponsored by the church or place of employment 2. Located to an area away from the Big City. 3.  A job waiting for him 4. a trade that Canada needs 5. 5 years of no criminal convictions and occasional background checks from the RCMP 6. everyone in the family has to go to school to learn English"

239929,Cudz,2008-08-15 04:58:00,2652,"Yes, often called investment immigration or business immigration.  It is a fast track to immigrate here.  You have to have a certain net worth and invest $200000 (or something like that).  Speeds up the process 10 fold.  copied from an immigration site. Investors and Entrepreneurs typically need to bring a minimum of $250,000 with them to Canada. This money is meant to be invested in Canada or to start a business there. It is common for several people to put their money together so as to have over the $250,000 and this money is used to get the first person into Canada as an Entrepreneur or Investor. After a year, that money is sent out of Canada, and then re-enters the country with another ""entrepreneur"". Using this method, the very same money can be used to get several people into Canada over several years.

You don't automatically get beheaded when you have committed a murder.  you won't lose a hand for ""stealing a loaf of bread""  You won't get life in prison for smoking a joint. We watch too much TV.   And yes, if my child killed another child in a fight because they were being bullied and then the government (i don't care which one) was going to chop my child's head off, I would cry.

239972,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-08-15 13:51:00,0,"I ask. What makes a Canadian a Canadian? Should our Government speak out for those that were born here alone?  When Canada takes these people in, they are Canada's responsibility. I'm not saying that Canada should pay their legal bills or anything like that. But if there are Canadian citizen's that are imprisoned for no reason or given harsh sentences, it is up to the Canadian government (and every decent human being on the planet)to speak up.  These kids took another life. They must be punished. Was it a one punch accident, or was he beaten to a pulp? Did they start it? Was the person killed a known trouble maker or non-violent individual.These are some of the questions that should decide the severity of the punishment. I believe beheading in this case is not warranted. And I believe Canada should speak up to defend its citizens as would any other country."

I was born in Canada.....my biological parents were Danish and Nigerian....i was adopted by an English mother and a newly Canadian father (he was born in Cuba but grew up in Jamaica and Greneda in the carribean). We moved permanently to the UK when i was 7 years old in 1975. I have just returned to Canada after a 33 year absence....i have always held a Canadian passport...and so has my father...we both have dual citizenship as we became British Citizens also......are we both not still Canadians? Does it make a difference if we leave and come back? once Canadian not allowed to leave ? I know plenty of  Canadian expats.  Do you have to be born here to be Canadian?

It is our country's responsibility to defend its citizens, don't give no Bull about how you are more Canadian than they are.  For people to sit here and claim they are more 'Canadian' than they are is quite pathetic. We have a legal system, legally they are Canadian as any of us, so don't try to pretend you're superior cuz you were born here or you've been here a few years longer.  You know who the REAL Canadians are? NATIVES. Perhaps its an inconvenient truth. They are more Canadian than any of us will be, the original natives and inhabitants of this land."

Willingly relocating BACK to a part of the world where human life has no more meaning than a pile of dog poop is at best a misguided decision, but it strikes me as colossal stupidity.

For starters there is video tape evidence from what I heard on the news last night that was taken with cell phones? These two are apparently pretty darn guilty by most accounts. Maybe not 1st degree murder, but they are 100% guilty of Manslaughter at the very least. Which in that country can carry the death penalty as well, and they are citizens of that country as well... Not sure a Canadian Intervention is warranted. Would we be invloved if the police were putting them into prison for life? I doubt it... Its mearly the punishment that got people riled up. The Idea of Be-heading is still fresh in peoples minds(Ie the greyhound bus horror) Lets face facts, These 2 guys are way more Saudi then Canadian to put it bluntly. They were born abroad, spent the minimum number of years here to gain Citizenship then left... Text book case of milking the system. So were is the line drawn? Should we intervene only when some one is sentenced to death?  These guy live there and they are subject to those laws the same way people who live here are in fact subject to our laws. One thing we know for sure is they Killed someone!!!! Was it purposeful?...I don't know, and neither does anyone here"

239877,JohnF,2008-08-15 01:15:00,3494," I agree. If someone chooses to immigrate to Canada, then they should embrace the Canadian way of life, including the laws and accepted customs, and not expect us to alter our lifestyle to that of the country they chose to leave.  And by the same token I believe that if a Canadian chooses to emmigrate to another country they should embrace that country's life style, laws, and customs and not try to impose our Canadian values on their new country.  This is a matter of choice, not a matter of pick and choose. If that sounds harsh .... tough.  JF"

GB has a very similar system to ours (more arabs, croatians, serbs, bengali and pakistanis immigrate there than do to Canada.  Way more).  A record 582,000 people came to live in the UK from elsewhere in the world in 2004, according to government experts. Of the 582,000 who arrived, about 494,000 were not British citizens - a record number. The remaining 88,000 were British citizens returning from living abroad.   ----These statistics are  is for 2004 only USA had over 700,000 immigrants in 2004 Canada had 235,808 in 2004  France is full of North African immigrants Germany full of Turkish immigrants among others. Australia (although the majority are opposed to it) have a very similar immigration policy to ours as well.  I have lived in Australia, England (2 years), Germany(4 years) and in the Middle East (almost 8 years)  Story is that they were being bullied.  Stood up for themselves and went a bit far beating up a bully.  It was a mistake. Those kids are Canadian.  Sorry if that bothers some of you but remember most of you were (or have relatives that were) immigrants.  Loads of these people dream of becoming Canadian citizens and will do anything to become so.  They are often from Palestine or Lebanon and just want a place for their kids to go to university and settle and work in after school.  A Palestinian often does not have a country to call home.

In case nobody told you, PALESTINIANS DON'T HAVE A HOME COUNTRY! Most live in Jordan as refugees while others occupy the west bank and gaza.  A brief history lesson.  Palestine was sold (just after WW2) by the Brits to the Jewish population and is now called Israel.  I assume everyone knew that though.  Maybe sold is a bit harsh.  It was given.  The palestinians living there at the time were told to take a hike.  I am not pro arab or anti Israel.  I am just stating that Palestinians don't have their own country so they try their best to immigrate to another country to become citizens.  For them to do this I am almost 100% sure that the kids parents would have probably put up $200000 to come here.  People on OFC know that you can buy your way into this country right?"
