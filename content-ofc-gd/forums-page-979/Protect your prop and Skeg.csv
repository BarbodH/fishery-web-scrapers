See images from Bass pro shop.  I got a used one from Ebay at a good deal, and my prop has not have a single ding since then. There are other smaller skeg protector, but this Model will protect the prop as well. I heard from others that it does create some drag on certain speed, I would sacrifice some drag rather than worry of getting my prop damage.  I am still catuious when approaching 5 feet of water , inspite of being cautious, I still will hit rocks every so often, Thanks to the skeg protector, it has help me avoid potential damage to my prop and Skeg.  I damaged my lower unit housing and prop once hitting Rice lake sunken railroad at 1:00am. Since then I am smarter and way more cautious."
