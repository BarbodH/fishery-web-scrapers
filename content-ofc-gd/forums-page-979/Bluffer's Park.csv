239924,Cudz,2008-08-15 03:57:00,2652,I fished the marina for 2 mornings and caught gobies.  I had one fish on (probably a pike) and had another mouth my bait (small pike 6 ft in front of me).  I could not find any weed beds.  One local fisherman told me something was up because 1 week earlier there were weed beds.  What gives?  Did they dredge or remove them somehow?
