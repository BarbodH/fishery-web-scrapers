239984,limeyangler,2008-08-15 14:54:00,5204,"short walk, medium carp for me."
239985,limeyangler,2008-08-15 14:55:00,5204,"short walk, medium carp for me."
240050,FishingInTheDark,2008-08-15 18:07:00,25,Short walk! Carp are a good fight still?...
237741,Rich,2008-08-08 15:56:00,3927,"lol I got a few hours to kill so I'm gonna go fishin' after I get some stuff done here figured I can never decide so I'll let ""the people"" decide!"
237744,Reef Runner,2008-08-08 15:59:00,980,"I was sold on the short walk, lol."
237746,cram,2008-08-08 16:01:00,1733,"Moderate, or the short one for carp."
237748,cranks bait,2008-08-08 16:01:00,721, I was thinking the same thing.  I've never fished any of those species so I don't know.  More time fishing is better than more time walking.  Carp on light gear sounds like a hoot.
237751,Leecher,2008-08-08 16:03:00,7832,Short walk so that you can spend more time fishing  Leechman
237753,FLEX ROD,2008-08-08 16:05:00,394,"Specs and Browns on a Fly vs Crap, oh pardon Carp no contest in my books.  FLEX"
237754,GoneFishin,2008-08-08 16:07:00,349,Go to the bass and fish them hard  lol. I wish I had that many spots to fish within walking distance. Goodluck on your choice.
237757,highdrifter,2008-08-08 16:10:00,2534,"Go for the specks!  Hey, did you get my last PM??  HD"
237762,timmeh,2008-08-08 16:34:00,609,I envy the fact you have such options withing walking distance. I can only walk for bass and pike and those spots are mennonite hotspots and so there's not really many fish there anymore.
237775,JohnF,2008-08-08 17:13:00,3494," The only fish I can walk to are my neighbour's Koi. Should I wacky rig for them, or go weedless?  JF"
237785,Musky or Specks,2008-08-08 17:28:00,2710,This is a cool way to do this Rich it was a lot of fun for me. Im making you go fish Specks. Because of my name. Personally I wouldnt fish carp if my life depended on it. But I know you enjoy it so if you go carping good luck. But if you go and fish Patterson or Kent better luck.
237795,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-08-08 17:43:00,0,Carp. Closest spot and almost guaranteed some action.
237798,jwl,2008-08-08 17:50:00,1056,"I didn't add to the vote becasue for me, not really applicable. But, I am one of the lucky ones I guess, I live so close to the Upper Niagara River that I can see it from the end of my driveway and depending on the time of year I can walk like 3-4 blocks and get into some great fishing..pending time of year...steelies,lakers,browns,walleye,pike,muskies,perch,smallies are right in the neighbourhood and readily available from shore"
237825,Guest Fishing For Life,2008-08-08 19:24:00,0,Has anyone hit fish when throwing heavy wacky-pitching?
237831,Beans,2008-08-08 20:01:00,3339,"Short walk or take a nap hmmmm...decisions, decisions...  Take a nap...it is pouring rain again..."
237846,Rich,2008-08-08 20:53:00,3927,So the final consensus was to go for the speckies and browns. I headed out for about an hour to find that I can no longer access what was my best spot. Headed to another less favourable spot and just caught a few chub minnows before heading home. Oh well at least me and the dog got out of the house and enjoyed the day.
237851,modny,2008-08-08 21:05:00,502," i totally understand what u mean man..  but at the same time, atleast u can get out for some pike or bass...  short walking distance for me means jiggin for turds( bbrown troutz) in the sewer"
238054,Leecher,2008-08-09 14:36:00,7832," Rich sorry to hear that your favorite spot wasn't accessible.....but on a positive note, you got out fishing... to me that's number one  Thanks for reporting! Leechman"
238197,Rizzo,2008-08-10 01:42:00,4754,"short and long are relative terms. What do you consider a short versus a long walk? To me short is around 5 minutes, moderate 15 and long might be half an hour. If you don't have a lot of time, I guess go with short. Got 3 or 4 hours I'd say go to the quarry...then again, sounds like I'm too late to offer any advice. Oh well, at least you got to play with your chub"
238228,Rich,2008-08-10 10:02:00,3927,"Quarry is a 1 hour walk, moderate walk 20 - 30 min, short spots 5 min away. lol I don't think I'll do the quarry walk again anytime soon."
238771,holdfast,2008-08-11 22:41:00,1813,Get a Motor Bike and fish them all.  Hope THAT helps
238781,carp-starter,2008-08-11 23:10:00,253,"I chose ""a short walk for speckled and brown trout"". If I had no car, I would not have a problem in the spring or the fall.  I live about 10 houses from Bronte Creek and 10 to 15 minute of slow walking to get to Bronte Harbour.  carp-starter"
239475,lunkerbasshunter,2008-08-13 19:54:00,2585,"i love walking, its good for you and since i love bass i woudl take the long walk to the crappie with the chance at bass  cheers!"
239507,Mark Kulik,2008-08-13 21:44:00,348,"Rich -get youself a bicycle 1 hr walk turnes into 10 min ride! little specks! like catching smelt, fun but not like bass and crappie-i'd choose the carp options, i grew up near the Humber river, they at least pull nice!"
239535,Rich,2008-08-13 23:20:00,3927,I got a bike but prefer to walk. Walking everywhere has contributed to me losing 106 pounds in the last 2 years.  I guess if I used the bike I could just ride even further though!
