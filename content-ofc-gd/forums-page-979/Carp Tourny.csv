240166,CLofchik,2008-08-16 01:27:00,854, There's also a free bay wide derby tomorrow (Saturday)  http://www.hamiltonwaterfront.com/fishingderby.php
240205,denisk,2008-08-16 11:28:00,163,The weekend weather looks awesome for both events.  Last night we went walleye fishing and got a couple limits so for anyone attending the Maco match you are invited to a fish fry after the event.  Fresh Walleye with some Chronzy batter mix it should be pretty good
240283,modny,2008-08-16 19:21:00,502,u caught walleye in the hamilton bay?
240297,denisk,2008-08-16 21:25:00,163,No we caught them in lake erie

240349,Spiel,2008-08-17 01:01:00,9065,"....On a more serious note I spent most of the day down there (today) assisting all the up and coming young anglers with baiting hooks and hook removal (lots of dead gobies!). Many clubs were present and all the kids were getting fish and having fun. Kids who showed up with no rods were given one and were able to keep them or trade them in for prizes at the end of the derby.  There certainly was plenty to see and do and I know I'm looking forward to next years event (I'll be better prepared  ).  Kudos to all who assisted in making this a great day for the kids.  denisk, hope you have a great turn out for the event."
