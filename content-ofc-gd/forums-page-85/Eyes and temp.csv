1010167,captpierre,2017-07-29 12:35:00,2521,Last year at this time the lake peaked at 83 F. Yesterday 73 F.  Will warm up still likely. Definitely doing better with eyes this summer. Coincidence?
1010169,mike rousseau,2017-07-29 13:23:00,4661,Nope  I would say you just have the pattern figured for low 70's and haven't figured out the really warm bite  I have yet to see a fish that stops eating when it's warm... they will change feeding times... locations... target food when it warms up though  Good to hear your having a good year though
1010175,porkpie,2017-07-29 16:02:00,2521,"Last summer I had to fish earlier or later due to extreme temps.  This year has been pretty consistent.  It has been a banner year mainly because I've spent more time in the boat because most days aren't extreme scorchers like last summer.  Most days last year I didn't really want to fish through the heat of the day.  High water helps I believe.  Categorically our best years have always been high water years.  Don't ask my why, just many years of observation. This year has been unbelievable for pics!"

1010180,OhioFisherman,2017-07-29 17:03:00,6623,"Well cooler water holds more dissolved oxygen than warmer water.  http://omp.gso.uri.edu/ompweb/doee/science/physical/choxy1.htm  Consistent higher water levels open more feeding areas to fish, probably more spawning areas too?  A lot of the walleye charter captains on this side of Lake Erie move from the shallower western basin to the central or eastern basin to follow the walleye migration as the water temps heat up, deeper water."

1010275,Joeytier,2017-07-30 23:18:00,3990,Lakes in NE Ontario are mostly in the low 70's (maybe a bit higher after the last 2 days) and the water is high but not overly so.  Definitely higher than typical mid summer levels.
