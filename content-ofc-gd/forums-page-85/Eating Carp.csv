1010425,captpierre,2017-08-02 00:12:00,2521,"So my son is a master at catching carp off the dock here on north Pigeon. Usually they are 15+ lb. Yesterday he catches a 10 lber. Let's see what they taste like. Looked up a bunch of recipes. Tried frying with Fish Crisp, grilling with jerk rub, marinated with soy sauce/lemon juice. I must say it tasted pretty good. Only problem is the bones. Usually with an eye, I cut out a wedge containing the Y bones and we're boneless. Carp don't seem to have Y bones that you can feel on the inside of the fillet. Yet lots of big ones  are present all over the place except in  the belly meat. Unless there is some way to remove them the carp won't have to worry anymore. Anybody know?"
1010427,Fisherman,2017-08-02 00:33:00,7201,"You could always try pickling them, that makes the bones disappear."
1010428,OhioFisherman,2017-08-02 00:42:00,6623,Capt lots of videos on youtube!    Eat more carp!
1010430,Old Ironmaker,2017-08-02 01:01:00,8243,Saw it served Asian style a few times. Carp is cooked in a long Wok while alive and eaten before it dies.
1010435,manitoubass2,2017-08-02 01:18:00,11391,Aaaaaaand that's why people hate eating carp lol
1010437,Old Ironmaker,2017-08-02 01:32:00,8243,"I like my food good and dead before I eat it, most of us do. I am told Carp are good, I will never know for certain. I can tell you Snake tastes like a mild fish. I didn't ask before I ate it. Snails taste like I thought it would, snails."
1010451,Fisherman,2017-08-02 12:46:00,7201,"Funny how bottom feeders don't taste like what they eat, lobsters and crabs would taste like ....."
1010464,AKRISONER,2017-08-02 15:46:00,5558,i guarantee a lobster tastes about 10000x better than a carp lol
1010466,OhioFisherman,2017-08-02 17:15:00,6623,"i guarantee a lobster tastes about 10000x better than a carp lol  LOL, I have had and attended many pig roasts, I don't feel bad at all about skipping water pig ones!"
1010469,aplumma,2017-08-02 17:39:00,6896,Clean and season the carp. Place on oak board and broil for 20 minutes at 300 F. Then remove from oven and board. Throw carp in trash and eat the board.  Art
1010472,Headhunter,2017-08-02 18:23:00,5703,You forgot the Hickory Chips on the board Art! Gotta mask the taste of the fish when eating the board. HH
1010474,outllaw,2017-08-02 18:36:00,1232,"in the 1960,s. we would clean carp. boil and feed the cats outside. they loved it..we were sophisticated we ate bullheads and silver bass lol."
1010476,PUMP KNOWS,2017-08-02 18:46:00,937,"Yummy xmas carp.  When I fish for carp, I see a lot of eastern europeans that keep carp out of lake ontario.  They say they love it."

1010570,Old Ironmaker,2017-08-03 21:05:00,8243,"I've seen this done twice, both times deep fried at the table. 1st time was Toronto not Taiwan, the second time was in Osaka, at our table. Great way to clear a table of a bunch of Canadians. The Japanese hosts were mortified by some of the guys reactions. Now if I was going to eat Carp this is the way to do it, mmmmmmmmmmm!!!  "
