1009341,mrpike,2017-07-18 04:15:00,151,Hello anyone been down to Hay Bay . I am going down this coming week end. And I am looking for any fish reports I can find out there. It's been about eight years since I was there last. And I always went around the MAY long weekend. So its all new to me this time of year. What kind of fishing can I expect this time of year.   THANKS .
