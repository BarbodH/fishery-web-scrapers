I only have a 5 horse on my 14 foot so the run up to the top end of Wicksteed is a little long and the lake is a little stumpy which worries my wife. Any help would be appreciated I should add that a launch that isn't to tough would help as I would basically be launching by myself, my boat is on a trailer but can drag it short distances if I need to. Thanks in advance."

Get your self some Green Go getters with worms or minnows. without giving to much away, look for the sandy beach there's a spur coming of it, which is great for pike & eyes"

Use Fishonline to find lakes with Walleye in them, no shortage of smaller lakes with pickeral near Marten River... the pike and bass only lakes can be quite fun as well."
