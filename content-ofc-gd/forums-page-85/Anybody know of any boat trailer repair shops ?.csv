Does anybody know of a shop that either straightens frames, or has the capacity to install a new cross member? I really don't want to buy a new trailer ....  I am located in Toronto area  Thanks for any suggestions and help"
1010815,misfish,2017-08-07 16:09:00,29133,Check for auto frame straightening on line.  https://www.yellowpages.ca/search/si/1/auto+frame+straightening/Toronto+ON

1010820,Garnet,2017-08-07 17:53:00,2056,Are the tires tracking crocked and how noticeable is it.
1010824,Big Cliff,2017-08-07 20:09:00,6899,What make of trailer is it? On some makes the rear crossmember is bolted on and it might be less expensive just to replace it
1010825,buick14,2017-08-07 20:31:00,741,"Thanks everyone !  Nah, trailer isn't  tracking crooked that I know of.  IT would not be so bad, but the problem is the rear bunk connectors are on that cross member, and they are now on an angle.  I assume they are no longer able to carry the load and will continue bend and potentially cause more problems in the long run  Rare cross member is welded in.  It's a ranger boat trailer combo .  Piece of junk trailer imo as the rear brace has always literally been inches off the rod and I scrape everywhere ..."

1010827,misfish,2017-08-07 20:48:00,29133,PB is just as bad as the  RED X we use to get here many years ago.

They made me up a new axle when I bent mine and they where fast and very helpful.  It's an old school shop.  Mind you I have no idea where you live?"
1010832,Old Ironmaker,2017-08-07 22:20:00,8243,"He lives in T.O. area.  I might contact Mishka Trailers in Hamilton. An old pal owns it, they do great work. After all from Toronto it is only a 45 minute drive, or on some days 2 hours and 45 minutes."
1010855,buick14,2017-08-08 10:27:00,741,"Thanks all this gives me some hope and a great place to start (and end hopefully).  Would prefer Hamilton to Fergus, but fergus is better than a new trailer !!!!  And I hate photobucket I'll be damned if I pay $399 to use that mediocre service"
1010859,Garnet,2017-08-08 10:51:00,2056,You never know what Top Gun has around .
1010865,buick14,2017-08-08 13:27:00,741,"^ Top Gun ? I'm not familiar with that place.  Did a quick search online, I assume the one in Gilford? I'll look into it also."
1010867,NANUK,2017-08-08 14:20:00,797,"There is fabrication shop in Scarborough, he does good work, even makes new trailers, Let me know if location suites you ( Brimley/Progress )"
