I have an old single reflex Practica that I paid for with Steinburg's Pinky stamps in High School, grade 9 I think, I turned down 500 years ago. What am I going to do with an extra 500 bucks, 2 dinners out and some gas for the boat. I'll keep it. I have a box full of old cameras from 3 Leica's that were my wife's Grand Fathers to an old 60's era Nikon. I have to see what I have there. The problem is they made 100's of thousands of cameras a year maybe more.  Who's old enough to remember Pinky stamps, man you must be old if you do."

I have a tablet and a laptop here. I will not pay for Data Usage because I don't need to be that connected. I know of I still had the business it would be a mandatory tool. But for me and many others the extra 75 or more I was quoted or what ever it is is just simply redundant. I know people that won't walk to the next room to use a PC and would rather strain to see what is on a 3"" by 5"" screen.

Totally agreed Chris.  But what the hell can anyone do about it?  I'm just honestly hoping now, that all those using the place for free, leave soon.  Those that can easily move out of their plans, do so ASAP.  Businesses look to other hosts that are cheaper, and go!  That this is just a temporary threat, nightmare or whatever.. to drastically thin the herd and see who or what remains.  As has been said, don't want to even think of the costs ahead... or work... or both which may come of this.

I had to find all the pictures again on memory cards, upload them again and redo the report. It was tedious and not fun at all.  Maybe some tech guys can fairly easily move all those pictures and back them up? I'm thinking now is the time to do that though. There's a chance everything could be lost.

On a paid plan, with 6600 images stored, I still have 62% more storage allowable.  Pretty sure that the plus plan last paid was about $65CAN for the year.  Today, I messaged them asking they honor their fine print and continue with my same customer service until the December 31, 2018 cutoff date they have written they will provide.  The response in my email just now was, ""You spoke, we listened!""  And a link was provided for me to immediately setup monthly payments of $60US  for their 500 Plus plan.  Before I pour a scotch later, I have been taking deep breaths and uploading the latest fishing report photos to IMGUR.  Which is one clumsy site to deal with big bulk photo uploads.  It would only be temporary.  SmugMug is another online suggestion for image hosting... It advertises $6 a month... but says nothing about max bandwidth and is kinda vague on third party.  As I said to Brenda tonight... I can't imagine the small businesses and hobbyists using PB are very happy at this point but, little in online media seems to suggest anyone can do a thing about this.  Been uploading with them since 2004 and what feels like a life's work is being held for ransom.  Lose it, and it's kinda like someone coming into your home and burning all your photo albums and personal journals.  So, Bren says, pay it, because the time to redo it all would be a far greater price.  But the thought of paying the Devil rather sucks!  No warning, no consideration, it seems criminal.  Damn, it won't let me download my bucket, always getting an error. Single image download seems to work still but that will be a pain.  They give you the option to download, say you can do it but, when I tried, they slowed my computer to a stop by flooding me with ads and cookies and other garbage.  All they're ""changes"" over the months I guess have been put in place just to screw us over.   Dave... I like your idea with Wordpress and pay about $90 a year for bunksoutdoorangle but, I don't think they have the capacity to host even half the photos and, not sure I'd have the capacity to redo all the data necessary to change 97 fishing stories.   Shayner bud!  I still sit at a desktop and prefer it.  lol"

1010075,Moosebunk,2017-07-28 01:24:00,3970,Good to know!  Will look into things further at Wordpress.
1010083,Old Ironmaker,2017-07-28 02:49:00,8243,"I'm with you Dave, sans the hearing aids, And I just started to use Photo Bucket successfully except here of course.  I have read a few alternate ""free"" sites bounced around here some are going with. The question for this old sore crippled up ""I used ta do that"" which one do I go with? Looking for simplicity here. I no longer have that intern and I.T. guy to do stuff for me. So which do I choose?  Thanks all.  Johnny D."
1010099,Sinker,2017-07-28 04:51:00,8692,"I guarantee you fella's who are using a pc would see A LOT more pics if we could upload from mobile. Hell, I might even post reports again.  S."
1007830,dave524,2017-06-30 12:20:00,4508,"Haven't seen it here yet but elsewhere, looks like they want you to pay to enable 3rd party hosting. Anyone else seen the greyed out box where a picture is supposed to be with a message sending you here.  http://photobucket.com/p500/"
1007831,grimsbylander,2017-06-30 12:28:00,3016,I haven't seen that but photobucket is a mess now for pop ups and running slow.
1007853,BillM,2017-06-30 14:11:00,17367,"Photobucket just offed itself.  With so many other free hosting sites, no one is going to pay that kind of $$$ to keep their pics."
1007858,John Bacon,2017-06-30 14:38:00,3277,I used Photobucket to post the pictues in this post.  They seem to be working.  This just start within the last few days?http://ontariofishingcommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=84730
1007860,BillM,2017-06-30 14:42:00,17367,"Yup, you'll most likely be getting an email soon.  They've removed all 3rd party hotlinking (ie posting photos to other website) from their free plans.   My photos went dead this morning."
1007861,SirCranksalot,2017-06-30 14:47:00,3291,I used Flickr for some purposes but have not tried that particular feature. It seems to be a generally good site.
1007865,msp,2017-06-30 15:45:00,1336,"I gave up on Photobucket long ago. Too many glitches, pop ups and very , very slow. Photobucket is the main reason why I don't share picture or posts here any longer. Too much of a P.I.T.A"

1007878,Governator,2017-06-30 17:11:00,879,"imgur.com - super easy on a desktop, no account required or use the app from your mobile.  Literally just go to the site and drag a photo to it and it's there, or multiple images for an album.  No ads no fuss."

1007992,Mister G,2017-07-02 01:41:00,1429,Photobucket is holding all my pictures for ransom. It says I have exceeded my storage limit and now need to pay a monthly fee to access my picture library. WTH........  They want anywhere from $59 to $399 to upgrade my account to access MY PICTURES...they can go to you know where.....
1008006,mike rousseau,2017-07-02 13:52:00,4661,Mine works fine
1008007,dave524,2017-07-02 14:03:00,4508,"Mine works fine  Mine are all still here too. The ones my wife had problems with were images on a club web page she designs and maintains for a group, maybe we a OK with linking to a forum like this ."
1008008,lew,2017-07-02 14:11:00,12766,"Until a few days ago my Photobucket had become slow and I had to log in every time I used it, but now it's fast again and I no longer need to log in each time. No idea what happened but it seems I can still post pictures with no issues.  I spose time will tell though.  "
1008010,Moosebunk,2017-07-02 14:39:00,3970,"For a decade they've allowed free image hosting to the masses... Guess it's time they want something in return..? 15 billion images!!!  Have had to pay for some years now. Every now and then things get glitchy, like today (which they've posted about changes being made) but otherwise they're purdy good!  Might have about 4,000 photos in there now and I'm at 37% space used on a $40 annual plan."
1008015,BillM,2017-07-02 15:06:00,17367,Good thing about PB is that you can download each one of your libraries in zip format.   I'm switching everything over to Imgur.
1008016,dave524,2017-07-02 15:35:00,4508,"Guess the free account I used for here and other forums is toast, went to log in with my user name and password as it logged me out for some reason  , won't accept my password    , says passwords must be 6 characters or longer, mine was only 5, had it for like 10+ years. No great loss, the pics are all on my external and if they are not going to allow 3rd party linking it will be pretty much useless anyway."
1008082,Tom S,2017-07-03 02:06:00,362,"Good thing about PB is that you can download each one of your libraries in zip format.   I'm switching everything over to Imgur.  Did the same thing yesterday. Watched a couple forums lose a bunch of content due to changes with Photobucket, and I was getting sick of the slow and clunky site. Imgur seems much nicer."
