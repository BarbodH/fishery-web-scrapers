1010478,Skeeter90,2017-08-02 19:13:00,1,Hey guys new to this forum. I going on a camping/fishing trip on Stoco Lake in Tweed from Aug-26 to Sept-2nd. I'll be solo mostly fishing for Bass/Pike. Does anybody wanna do a little Muskie fishing and help a guy out who's never gone fishing for Muskie before.?
1010501,moxie,2017-08-03 00:16:00,1566,Welcome aboard. Been a few years since we gave up the Muskie chase but Stocco amd Moira Lakes were favorites of ours. Still some big fish there.  Call Pro Tackle and if Stacey is in the mood he's the guy to speak to. Good luck.
