On a downhill and a corner parking for about 5 and dicey at best. Fun Lake. Very very busy lake, lived on the lake for many years. Fishing is slow and the boat traffic is just crazy now. Put it this way, the last time I went there, I had a guy on a sea doo do circles around me in the middle of the lake in a canoe. If I got a hold of him it wouldn't have been pretty, too bad I didn't call in for that one.  If you are driving 3 hours from Ajax, I urge you to look maybe in huntsville/haliburton direction where the fishing will be much better."
