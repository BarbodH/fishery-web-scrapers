Now that the fish are in the winds are getting silly again. 25KPH average, gusts to 50K's. Even in a 25' glass I/O trying to set lines in 4' plus waves gets ridiculous fast. I miss the calm waters and beautiful scenery of our northern and near north lakes. Erie makes Nippising look like a trout pond some days. I need to think closely about where our next chapter of life will bring us, and perhaps more importantly, the boat. My wife shows me an immaculate property on line and costs less than 1/2 the price of ours and it is absolutely great. I ask 2 questions, how close is a boat ramp and will the garage fit the trailer and boat?  Rant over, thank you. Go about your business, nothing to see here. Fish Farmer and CH312 excluded, they know of what I speak of."
