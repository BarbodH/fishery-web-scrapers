1010258,manitoubass2,2017-07-30 20:36:00,11391,Lol.  We did it in -40 conditions(not that it's safe) but it was practically standard procedure out west
1010259,misfish,2017-07-30 20:38:00,29133," Look other than Home Hardware, I find they are the most expensive around.     Not when you have, inside friends. Like the owner."
1010261,misfish,2017-07-30 20:47:00,29133,"Let the ,THREAD HI JACKING BEGIN . HAVE AT,ER LOL   Dinner was served,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,   A bath in many good things.    And slowly cooked to savor all the good things      BBQ comith very soon.   Thanks again for the help.  Time for ice cream and rolao cake."
1010262,Old Ironmaker,2017-07-30 20:52:00,8243,"Can't beat insiders. And call 911, another JD hi jack under way!!!!!!  Actually guys it's was standard operating practice to flare NG gas lines and cooling members with Coke Oven Gas burning at the end of a 6 foot pipe on the furnaces. It is the safest way of doing it. Of course we had a Superintendent that told us to soap test, yea I had to show him, the plastic bottle melted 4' away from the Blowpipe, OK boss.  What time is dinner served Brian? I just made a pot of Ragu today. I'll bring some Vino too."
1010264,ketchenany,2017-07-30 21:09:00,3229,"MastechefBarrrie coming this fall. Episodes featuring Brian B, aka Misfish, or lack of BBQ?"
1010265,Old Ironmaker,2017-07-30 21:14:00,8243,"No Idea what I am looking at, baked Whitefish maybe? All I know is I want some, no I want a lot of it. I'll pass on Desert if I can have more of whatever that is."
1010266,misfish,2017-07-30 21:14:00,29133,Misspelled. Rulade cake. YUMMY
1010269,FloatnFly,2017-07-30 22:20:00,1640,"i did smoked burgers on mine   get yourself one of these, king of grills  http://amazingribs.com/bbq_equipment_reviews_ratings/grill-combination-grill-smoker-drop-ins/kalamazoo-k750hs-hybrid-fire-grill"
1010276,Tom S,2017-07-30 23:20:00,362,"Yup, I tried another tank. Same issue. There seems to be back pressure. Regulator, I mean BBQ is done. Shhhhhhhhhhh   I wanted a new one any ways. Wife looks over shoulder as I type. LOL  I will get a deal at my local HH.  Shot regulator causing a big pressure drop will cause your icing. You're doing more refrigerating than cooking.  Go charcoal. Weber kettle. Nothing to break on that one."
1010283,Woodsman,2017-07-31 00:51:00,1286,Sounds more like an over filled tank. On a BBQ the tank should be drawing the vapor off the top of the tank. If it's freezing your getting liquid propane which by nature is very cold in the liquid state. On a propane forklift they run on liquid propane and draw out of the bottom of the tank not the top like a BBQ tank. On forklifts any small leak will frost over.
1010284,Woodsman,2017-07-31 00:59:00,1286,A quick way to check for an overfilled tank is to look on the tank for where the tare weight is stamped. Add this to 20 lbs (assuming a 20 lb tank). If your tank weighs more than (tare + 20 lbs) then it's over filled.
1010286,Woodsman,2017-07-31 01:03:00,1286,BTW: You didn't try to place the tank in another position other than upright?
1010345,DRIFTER_016,2017-07-31 23:16:00,10439,"Yep, you need a new one!!! Get setup like my buddy in Alaska has. It's pretty sweet!!!!!  "
1010364,FloatnFly,2017-08-01 02:24:00,1640,"Yep, you need a new one!!! Get setup like my buddy in Alaska has. It's pretty sweet!!!!!    im surprised its still in one piece........or does he have bear alarms around it lol"
1010366,Old Ironmaker,2017-08-01 02:43:00,8243,"Combustion has very little to do with carbon source temperature. Ignition point between -40C and +40C isn't much when we are talking 900C carbon ignition temp for coal for example, or far less than C0 in gases. Depends what we are trying to burn. Newspaper in an oven will light at baking temps, Propane and NG gas far less. Don't try and determine this at home. When we are needing to heat tanks on the job we are actually trying to melt frozen water in regulators not heat the gasses. Don't try this at home you nuts."
1010403,DRIFTER_016,2017-08-01 17:16:00,10439," im surprised its still in one piece........or does he have bear alarms around it lol  OH, there are plenty of bears but he has plenty of firearms to deal with said bears if needed plus he keeps the place clean."
1010416,Big Cliff,2017-08-01 20:21:00,6899," OH, there are plenty of bears but he has plenty of firearms to deal with said bears if needed plus he keeps the place clean. And it's a good source of meat for the BBQ and smoker"
1010224,misfish,2017-07-30 15:59:00,29133,"Just back from Costco. WOW only 8 bucks to fill the tank instead of 18 at ctc.  Anyhoo, I hook up the tank, BBQ fires up then the flames dwindle. Like it,s running out of gas. The thingamabob that hooks up to the tank is really cold. Frosting.   BBQ is fine. Used it last night, worked normal.   HELP   Thanks"
1010225,Tom S,2017-07-30 16:04:00,362,Might be to cold to create enough pressure yet. Got to warm up the tank.
1010226,misfish,2017-07-30 16:06:00,29133,Thanks Tom. I was thinking this. Letting it sit in the sun abit right now. Sure was busy there. Lined up.
1010227,manitoubass2,2017-07-30 16:07:00,11391,"Do like we did in the oilfield, use a tiger torch to warm it up lol"
1010228,ketchenany,2017-07-30 16:15:00,3229,If he does be ready to catch him!
1010229,Blue Lk,2017-07-30 16:18:00,337,"You may have to do a regulator ""reset"".Turn off tank & dissconnect,open all valves on BBQ for a minute,close valves & hookup tank & open tank valve slowly & you are good to go.I have to do this about once a season when when I can only get a small flame from burners,"
1010230,Tom S,2017-07-30 16:22:00,362,"Blue might be onto something with the regulator. The newer ones do need to be reset occasionally, some silly safety feature that has been added."
1010231,mike rousseau,2017-07-30 16:30:00,4661,Cold shouldn't matter  BBQs and propane heaters work in the middle of winter  I would unhook everything... open and close all knobs  Hook back up and see what's up
1010232,manitoubass2,2017-07-30 16:32:00,11391,Lol
1010233,misfish,2017-07-30 16:43:00,29133,"Well I did as suggested. It was good for about a minute or so then the regulator started to frost up. Guess it,s new BBQ time. It,s not a high end one, so not a big lose."
1010234,Big Cliff,2017-07-30 17:05:00,6899,"That's what you get for buying that cheep propane lol.  Buddy brought me his pressure washer last week because it wouldn't run. He had just filled it up with fresh gas he bought at the reserve. Drained the tank into a clear container, 5"" of water, 1/4"" of gas. Cleaned everything put fresh hi test in it, started first pull and ran like brand new."
1010235,Terry,2017-07-30 17:08:00,14456,could e dirt in the line could be tank too full and turning to gas in line and at gauge
1010236,FloatnFly,2017-07-30 17:18:00,1640,"propane will freeze at around -45F, so yes, it can be too cold for propane   could be time for a new regulator, a lot cheaper than buying a new BBQ"
1010237,FloatnFly,2017-07-30 17:21:00,1640,"simple test to see if the tank is too full, boil some water, then pour it down the side of the tank, the part that stays cool is the level of gas in the tank"

My first comment was man, this tank feels heavier then my normal fill from CTC. I am boiling noodles right now, I will try what you said FF, when they need draining.  As for dinner, I can adapt to still serve a great dinner.  Thanks all for the quick responses.  Thanks fellas  B"
1010240,ketchenany,2017-07-30 17:32:00,3229,IF it's done go get a bag of charcoal and you're good to go for today!

LOL  As a guy that works with tools all day, I dont have anything here that will allow me to remove all the fittings, OR I WOULD. LOL  I tried this hot water thing. As you can see, I did not see a line. I did how ever, get a wet foot. LOL    As for the noodles, they look marvelous . Nice summer salad.    Now to get busy preparing my  spicy coriander chicken.   Like the saying.  Adapt,improvise,over come.   I wish I had a charcoal BBQ right about now. LOL   Thanks again fellas   I envy HH right now. He has a nice new BBQ.  I now feel his old pain."

1010246,FloatnFly,2017-07-30 18:54:00,1640,"you won't see a line, but you'll be able to feel where the empty part of the tank gets warm, and the part with propane in it stays cool"
