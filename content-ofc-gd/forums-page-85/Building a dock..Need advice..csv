I only wish someone had of given me this advice 20 years ago when you could get a rustic cabin on the lake of bays for 80k....Now its a different story.. half a million for a run down shack. I have come to terms with the fact that ill never have a get away unless I do it this way. Having said that ill tell you about our park.. Its a good one.. A keeper if you will. The owner is top notch, he really is.. Even though hes a stinkin Argos fan. lol..3k a year for waterfront and a large double lot as well some of the best multi species fishing in all of Ontario. We pay our own hydro but water garbage pickup and sewage pump-out is included. They have a great rec hall for the kids and do a TON of events for the kids..He does have a 20 year rule but once grandfathered in you could keep it standing a 100 years if you want.. Just anyone new to the park cant bring anything in over 20 years.  Back to the dock now...lol I think im just going to  go with the sched 80 2 inch pipe pounded into the river bed. we have decided to go 5 x 16 with a deck to the existing stairs..Thanks for all your input folks.. its much appreciated . Will post pics when its finished..Heading up this weeknd to get it done"

Two people even trying to pass on a 4' dock can be a challenge especially after a few brew.  As for decking material, spend the extra money and go with the plastic wood type of decking, it will save you money in the long run.  Take those brackets back. They are designed to pinch the post against the wood, there is a better type available from dock supply stores that actually pinches the post against the bracket, it's a bit more money but a far superior system.

Everything is great until the park owner gets an offer he can't refuse. Real estate speculators are buying up trailer parks and developing them into lakefront McMansions. A beachfront site here on Erie at Knights Beach was going for 10K buy in and 5 grand a year rent 6 years ago. No idea how much now. He turned down many millions to develop the land for residential homes, up till now anyway."

1010085,tb4me,2017-07-28 03:00:00,3295,Hello OFCers how are ya all.?I want to build a small dock at my trailer in the Trent river..The water can be high and fast at times..The dock i want to build is going to be built and suspended above the water with pipes pounded in the riverbed. I was wondering what type of pipe I can use? Galv is stupid expensive fence posts are too weak in my opinion. I can get 1.9 inch schedule 40 pipe for 26 bucks for 10 feet. This is looking like the best option to me. The wife and I both agree a floating dock is not for us so this is the method were going to go with..Im looking for any advise or pointers as I have never done this before. Perhaps you fine folk can come up with some ideas....How can I share pics now with this photobucket nonsense ?

1010094,Old Ironmaker,2017-07-28 03:59:00,8243,"The pic works well Ron. When I read your title I read deck not dock. I thought I could help but not for dock. My brother is the dock expert. Are you intending on taking it out every fall? Budget is key to any project. That will tell you what you are going to build. Prices of materials are insane. Yesterday I went to 3 lumber yards out here to find a piece of Oak. A 3/4"" X 3"" piece of Oak was $3.10 a linear foot plus HST, I told my wife get out your card my dear lady if this is what you want. Over 70 bucks to replace 5 slats on a park type bench. I think I paid 75 bucks for it 25 years ago.  Ron look at Drifters thread about his home in the Yukon. A recent post showed what he is doing for his dock. Those cages will last until we and he are long gone. Like I said it's all about budget. The last few docks my Bother built for their and a neighbours were all aluminum. He can remove the 2 main sections by himself and he built the bases with stone boxes or otherwise known as Gambrels. It's not going anywhere in our lifetimes. I saw a episode of that Deck and Dock guy on Canadian HGTV do a few docks. Maybe go to HGTV or You Tube for the shows. I'm not positive about the name of the show but the guy is Canadian for sure.  I have to add kid bro is 61 now and says he isn't repairing the old heavy dock every year and replacing it every 15 like he has, plus when it's time to take it out every Oct. all the summer guests aren't around. Look to the future."
1010098,Sinker,2017-07-28 04:46:00,8692,Are you allowed to pound posts into the river bed?  why not a floating dock? May be your only option.  S.
1010103,Old Ironmaker,2017-07-28 06:39:00,8243,"Something I was thinking, what will they let you build, you have to ask. On my Brothers lake the Ministry of whatever are constantly on the look out for criminal offenders. He isn't allowed to cut the lawn X number of feet from the shoreline. And he needed a building permit to replace the dock that they made him replace because it was pressure treated that contained a ridiculously low level of arsenic. They went around the lake and asked cottage and home owners if their docks contained arsenic, say what? What ever you build it with if you use any wood keep your receipt, MSDS sheet and don't forget to WHIMIS label it."
1010114,OhioFisherman,2017-07-28 12:04:00,6623,"I have no idea of what is around your area, some metal reclaiming sites and junk yards here have all different types of "" scrap "" metal they will sell at not much over scrap prices, one man's trash is an other's treasure?  I am not sure what type of wood utility poles are made of, or if it is treated wood, but our local power company had damaged ones they would give away, that could be an option?"
1010135,tb4me,2017-07-28 20:03:00,3295,Im sure pounding posts in the river is not an issue..There are 30 docks down stream from me all built the same. As for lumber I was going to use the new pressure treated lumber. I was told it was ok as long as the dock is not going to be in the water. This dock will be14 inches above the water as the gunnel of my boat is at least that high above the water line. We plan to leave at least 2 feet of pipe above the dock surface so it can be loosened off and lifted even higher every fall.I don't plan on taking it out every year.. this is a once and done type dock..I hope to get at least 10 years out of it.. Our one neighbor has a floating dock and I constantly watch him struggle to walk or sit on it.. then when the fall comes he has to beg us friendly neighbors to help him drag it out..I towed it down stream with my boat and used the winch on my trailer to pull it up on the trailer and to high ground..I dont want  anything to do with that.Basically this dock will be 16 feet long and 4 feet wide. I want to be able to sit on it and have a cold brew while fishing and listening to tunes. Oh the life!
1010136,tb4me,2017-07-28 20:15:00,3295,This is the dock I currently use. I have since upgraded boats. The spot in the background with the massive rocks is my spot......Fun eh...https://photos.app.goo.gl/Qd9PT5NFoww5qFMb2

I agree with Big Cliff, if it's rooted to the ground you have to consider ice."
1010247,tb4me,2017-07-30 18:58:00,3295,"Awesome guys..Great advice. Im of the opinion that its better to beg forgiveness then to ask permission..Here's the deal.. Its in a trailer park. The park owner says go ahead, or he can build it for me for a fee..Thats good enough for me. All his docks have posts pounded into the ground. .As for ice I have NEVER seen ice here.. never...The beauty part of this spot is it moves year round. From the boat launch all the way up to my dock I could boat year round..So Ice is not going to be an issue. The reason i chose 48 inches is because my old dock was 32 inches..I may actually bump it up to 60 inches but no more then that.  My only real concern is water flow in the spring and debris like tree branches. As I had said earlier id be happy to get 10 years out of this dock. The dock i currently use is 12 to 15 ish..and its only 32 inches by 15 feet..So regardless of what I decide to do I have to keep in mind the park owns the land and I could be gone at any point.. Hence the low budget. If this were my land id blow the budget clean out of the water lol"

You aren't lying. Better yet don't sign a thing, I wouldn't unless I owned it, why would you, the owner doesn't seem to have an issue.  Can you take it with you when you leave? 1 reason I bought rather than got a trailer site when we were looking for a vacation place. Too many rules and zero appreciation in $$$ Stayed at a pals trailer when we were looking. 9:30 PM and the owner was driving around on his ATV telling everyone "" Fires out, music off!"". Say what??? It wasn't even dark. And that was 22 years ago and they were paying $2500.00 a season, May to Oct. Our place has gone from 89 grand and today I can get $450.000. He was told 10 years ago he needed to get his then new to him trailer off the property because it was going to be 20 years old. Got nothing for his ""old"" trailer and paid 25 grand for his new trailer. I'm sorry but I don't get the trailer site thing. As close to Socialism as you can get in Canada in my uneducated opinion. If he had done what I did, and encouraged him to do so, he could sell it and retired. He now has around $35,000.00 (oops thousands not millions) or more in site fees plus tank dump and water 22 years later with zero to show for his investment. He pays double for water and cistern because the owner has him by the orbs. I bet he has 100 grand into his rental. Now he has a letter telling him they have sold and he has until Oct. to get off the property or consider it abandoned. No way he can move that thing with 3 additions and decks. We paid far less than that in our initial investment that has quadrupled and no one tells me when I can or can not sit by our fire pit and play our music.
