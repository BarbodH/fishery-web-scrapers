1010307,OhioFisherman,2017-07-31 16:00:00,6623, Oh Yeh...I remember that...Damned if I can remember her name (it' me age don't you know)(Jack's favorite saying) I see her van at Buckeye Motel sometimes...I'm glad she didn't see me catch that muskie on corn...She might have wanted it...LOL  Corn on the cob with treble hooks? A new muskie lure?

We where telling her the story of you catching one on a hair rig baited with only 3-4 kernels of corn. Glad I was there to see that with my own eyes.
1010558,Tjames09,2017-08-03 19:36:00,664,Ya this was my implication of the original post. Some of your guys comments lol....  The guy said he kept the musky he catches to eat. He was saying all the fish he caught. I was being facetious when I replied to him and he shrugged it off because he didn't realize I knew the regs.  Anyways. The replies you guys come up with are something else.
1010567,Old Ironmaker,2017-08-03 20:51:00,8243,"Another reward for a good member that voices his opinion. Bash him, not good all. Because I don't agree with someone there is no need to get personal.  I hold 1 Musky in higher regard than a 1000 Carp, if not for there scarcity alone. And I have met guys fishing Carp in Hamilton Bay that hold Carp as the only fish worth catching. I personally think they may have a screw loose but don't break their bubble by telling them that. There is no such thing as Musky traps like there are Carp traps I don't believe. I saw them dumping Carp in a dump truck taking them to who knows where.  I eat neither by the way."
1010569,Old Ironmaker,2017-08-03 20:59:00,8243,"Whoooosh, that's the sound of this comment going over my head. Don't leave us hanging Fisherman. What are you talking about? I love gossip once in a while."

It's getting boring around here and Fox news vs. CNN and Politico.com is way out of hand.  edit: Not the site that is getting boring, my activities this summer.

1010861,Mister G,2017-08-08 11:44:00,1429,I don't get what all the fuss is here about eating muskie's........... I smoke all legal muskies because I really enjoy them. If they change the regs to catch and release only then I will smoke other fish instead but I don't see that happening anytime soon.  A caught legal muskie = Good Eats and that is what fish are for...............
1010891,jimmer,2017-08-08 19:35:00,2730,"Muskie are always a hot topic. They are loved and abused at the same time. However, they are also one of the few native fish in the Kawarthas, so they should be protected to some degree in that area. Not sure who decided to stock them in Haliburton. Having a slot doesn't really cut it; my belief is that they are hoping that all muskie will be able to spawn at least once. However, if someone wants to eat or mount a legal fish, it's within their right to do so without prejudice."

Amen hahaha  people will read things how they want them to be read, that also means they will change your very own words to make it say what they think they want you to say. It was pretty clear that you were pointing out that this guy eats all the musky that he catches regardless of size and legality."
1010087,Tjames09,2017-07-28 03:03:00,664,"We were looking at some waterfront cottages and one cottage we looked at the owner was there and started talking about how many musky he catches in sturgeon lake. He then went on to say how he loves the taste of musky meat and keeps them. I kindly reminded him the limit is one and over 40"". He quickly replied with oh theyre all over that size.....guess that's why I only catch small musky in sturgeon lake now"
1010090,Old Ironmaker,2017-07-28 03:17:00,8243,"Whether we agree with it or not he is well within his right to do it if he so chooses. I bet he is in his late 70's or in his early 80's at least. If we strongly believe that some gamefish such as the revered Muskellunge should never be kept such as the Sturgeon is now we have the democratic right to lobby to have the legislations changed through our Parliamentary assembly to reflect our beliefs. I really don't think that amendment to our regs. would come with a large outcry from the public.  I have an old grainy black and white photo of my wife's Grandmother standing in front of a stringer, not 1 fish a rope of 4 large Sturgeon caught here in Ontario. Most likely taken sometime in the 40's. Prior to the end of WW2 and really through to the 80's throwing back a fish was a waste. You caught it you ate it or gave it to someone that needed it."
1010092,tb4me,2017-07-28 03:40:00,3295,If he caught it legally then he is within his right to do so.. Not my cup of tea but who am I to criticize..
1010097,Sinker,2017-07-28 04:44:00,8692,Maybe you just suck at musky fishing?  Just sayin...  I catch lots of big musky in sturg. I'd bet my paycheck that more musky are killed by releasing them.  S.
1010105,Old Ironmaker,2017-07-28 08:31:00,8243,"This ^. I have caught and released hundreds of Smallies here on our beach in the last 21 years. Unfortunately many of the larger fish can be found on the beach that day or next day. If we do fish from shore now, even in the boat I have upped the tackle for the last many years to bring them in and released ASAP."

He is allowed to keep what ever he wants as long as it's legal,who are you to criticize what he keeps."
1010112,Old Ironmaker,2017-07-28 11:55:00,8243,"He is a Canadian and it his right to criticize whomever he wants to. It's called an opinion, you also have the right to disagree. Not a good way to start a good neighbourly relationship though. Talking to prospective neighbours is important when buying residential property. Hopefully you meet the Gladys Kravits of the hood and he or she gives you the lowdown on the entire neighbourhood."

1010119,dave524,2017-07-28 13:15:00,4508,"The MNR put musky in our  Haliburton bass/walleye lake years ago, none of the cottagers that we knew who fished were happy with that decision, everybody kept them and ate them for a few years , not bad eating actually, then dad sold the place so I don't how well the extermination program went.  Edit: Dad would go ballistic if he knew that damned jackfish and hammerhandles had invaded Haliburton."
1010120,AKRISONER,2017-07-28 13:17:00,5558,guys no need to bash TJames here haha holy crap   did you not read his comment where he told the guy the possession size and buddy replied that all of the musky he catches are over that size? lmao come on now...dude is clearly keeping and eating undersized illegal musky...thats the point here...he told the guy the regs and the guy shook him off.

1010131,manitoubass2,2017-07-28 19:07:00,11391,"Never tried musky but after the bass thread who really cares? If it's legal it's legal  Maybe he has 7 kids like me? Lol. That's alot of meat on a 40"" muskie"

1010141,Pigeontroller,2017-07-28 21:24:00,2793,The legal minimum size to keep one Muskie pr day in FMZ 17 is 44''   Another example of why we should have a basic test to prove you can read and understand the regs before you get your fishing license.
