1010045,Old Ironmaker,2017-07-27 21:26:00,8243,Used BB guns and then advanced to 22's in the summers of the swingin' 60' at a buddies farm pond in western NY when I spent summers there. Shootin' fish in a barrel isn't as easy a it looks. Poor fish. I'd think that weapon wouldn't leave much fish left. Can you imagine what would happen today if someone saw a few kids riding their bikes down the road in town with 22's slung over their shoulders dressed in Korean War fatigues?
