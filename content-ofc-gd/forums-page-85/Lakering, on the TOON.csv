1010095,Old Ironmaker,2017-07-28 04:21:00,8243,"Very good video Brian, when I saw it was only 3 minutes I opened it and watched it, all. That swim bait gives me an idea too. Guy here on Erie are jigging depths for suspended Piks lately. Going back to the old Erie Dearies and bladed jigs as the long lining hasn't been working as well, plus in my opinion it beats going for a putt putt boat ride for hours on end. That swim bait sure looks like a smelt to me. Hmmmm? Good suggestion dear Sir thank you. I need to dig around my bag of rubber.  I have to ask, how many miles to the gallon do you get on that barge? Would it fuel be measured in gallons of Ale perhaps? Keep up the good Toonin'. I wish they were around when my legs were like Oak trees. Everyone thought I was nuts when I took out the Kayak and a rod in 79'."

Just lots of flipping to get out there. The oars help.    Very good video Brian, when I saw it was only 3 minutes I opened it and watched it, all. That swim bait gives me an idea too.

Everyone thought I was nuts when I took out the Kayak and a rod in 79'.   Im glad I was able to have you take a few minutes of your day to watch  TY.  My fuel is,  get through my weeks (40 hr) work and enjoy my weekends. Enjoy  life, and enjoying the sport I love. A couple of x-large cups of java in the morning dosent hurt, One for the drive, and one for on the toon . Those give me the HP I need in the legs to get me out there. Like I have said before, fishing from the toon, I need to watch the weather . High winds more then anything. Tomorrow it,s calling for NNE 6 km.  I have picked another laker ground to jig. Shoreline protection is the key. I arrive  to my spots early enough , to see if the waters are fit for floating and to jig effectively. If I think it,s not, I have enough options in my area to head to with,n 20-30 minutes drive. I am always ready to fish for what ever waters offered up to fish.  Stay tooned, for the next adventure."
1010149,Terry,2017-07-28 22:39:00,14456,I like your wind report better then mine  mine says 7am 24km with gusts to 36

Not a boat to be seen. The whole bay to meself. Not a better feeling. LOL  Failed to mention, cant wait to try my new camera swivel extension."
1010151,Terry,2017-07-28 23:00:00,14456,"don't think i said anything about not going i will, as always decide that when i wake up and stick my head out the door and look at the text from you .cause you're on the water before I wake up. lol"

1009682,Terry,2017-07-22 18:09:00,14456,Ice fish
1009687,Rizzo,2017-07-22 18:57:00,4754,That's awesome...although your netting skills remind me of a buddy I USED to fish with! In your defense I suppose that net is a little small for that beast
1009689,misfish,2017-07-22 19:07:00,29133,"The song says,,,,,,,,  One is the loneliest number ,next to two,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,  I am happy with the loneliest,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,     New net is onderway. Found the right one for all the fishes out there. Big, small, and everything in between."
1009690,OhioFisherman,2017-07-22 19:34:00,6623,Dang! way to go flipper! That's a fat fish!
1009692,Walleye'm Fishing,2017-07-22 21:11:00,310,That was great! Congrats! I have the same net and I've caught some big fish with it but it gets stressful at times. It's a good idea for you to use a bigger one next time though...
1009693,Acountdeleted,2017-07-22 22:18:00,2562,Wow! What a greaser. Great catch bud.
1009695,spincast,2017-07-23 00:52:00,3279,"nice.    Getting out there, wherever you launched would be a good workout!"
1009696,manitoubass2,2017-07-23 00:54:00,11391,Friggen sweet!!!
1009698,LeXXington,2017-07-23 02:51:00,1928,Nice fish
1009699,Ralph Field,2017-07-23 13:01:00,1018,Great fish! You should be wearing a hat for protection from the sun.
1009703,Spiel,2017-07-23 14:08:00,9065,Awesome!
1009707,misfish,2017-07-23 16:18:00,29133,"Thanks fellas.  Thats the first time I have tried for lakers since bass season opened up. Our laker fishing seem to be in a funk, so stayed away from them. Like I said, It happened to be a good weather report for this type of fishing, and the row out easy.  Rick, I can row that float boat faster then most think. As far as distance, it,s not far at all. I have done 7 miles in a days outing.  As for a hat Ralph, on over cast days, I dont, but do have a wide brim in the truck at all times when the suns going to be beating on me. The shades never leave me. My eye will not allow me to be without them. The glare off the water is the worse when it,s sunny.  Thanks again fells.  The toons a blast."
1009730,GBW,2017-07-23 22:37:00,8460,"OPTIMISTIC I became, hummm. Yoda? Great fish MrB!"

1009741,manitoubass2,2017-07-24 01:07:00,11391,"Im trying to justify buying one and rigging it up, even with a bunk leg.  Brian, I showed this to my wife and even she said it looks like a blast"
1009782,AKRISONER,2017-07-24 17:02:00,5558,nice shootin tex!

1009881,Joeytier,2017-07-25 20:23:00,3990,Awesome!  I hope this doesn't trigger a cavalcade of tooners out to the big lake to grease you out of your spot!
1009886,misfish,2017-07-25 21:27:00,29133,"Thanks again   Awesome!  I hope this doesn't trigger a cavalcade of tooners out to the big lake to grease you out of your spot!  It,s not the tooners I worry about, it,s the dozen or so yakers that come out . They are a great bunch of fellas. Lots of room out there for all of us. I,ll be contemplating going to a yak next year. It will have stabilizers that is for sure."

I'm thinking more and more that a yak on the little speck lakes would be a load of fun, and deadly effective."
