1009302,tb4me,2017-07-17 23:48:00,3295,Is anyone else having issues again?

Apparently my problem was that I hadn't set it up do do automatic updates, he changed that and it seems to be working fine now. Just wondering if since you wiped yours clean and re installed if it defaulted back to manual updates.  I still have buffering issues occasionally but just go to a different source and can usually get around that. I am running 40 mbps wireless."

1009376,Dutch01,2017-07-18 17:42:00,1431,"Also, I'm seeing lots of complaints about exodus not working well. It's probably done as an add on as I'm pretty sure the developers have stopped supporting it.  I've been using Elysium lately with good results.  I find you have to search a show or movie 2-3 times then it will work. It times out before completing the search but resumes when you re-search. This bug may be specific to my box only....."

Luckily I run Kodi on a old laptop hardwired to the router and HDMI cable to the TV, makes it a little easier to stay on top of things as they change, definitely not a system that you set and forget like a Bell/Rogers/Cogeco satellite/cable/fiber box, so keep that in mind before cutting the cord."
