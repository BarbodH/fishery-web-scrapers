1009904,Duckie,2017-07-26 04:07:00,305,Hi Folks. caught what I believe is a silver pike in Montreal the other day. thought it was a muskie at first when I was fighting/landing it because of the big gray head and gray silver body. But looking at the pics later the spotting on the tail shows it to be a pike.  Google image search shows silver pike that are supposedly very rare that look exactly like this fish.  this fish was a good size. anyone ever catch one of these?  here is one  of the pics: I have another pic but having trouble resizing it. I wish the board would automatically resize pics 
1009906,Acountdeleted,2017-07-26 10:20:00,2562,Interesting. We used to get a few way up north in Thunder Bay. Very cool looking fish.
1009909,Tjames09,2017-07-26 10:40:00,664,"Weird, its scaley like a walleye. Was it smooth like a pike? or was it rough like a walleye?"
1009912,Canuck,2017-07-26 11:45:00,491,Looks to me like a light coloured ordinary pike. Probably living in clear water and not stains weedy areas. The spots are faint but visible. On a silver they should be virtually not visible.
1009928,Duckie,2017-07-26 15:32:00,305,I'll try to post the other pic I have tonight of the fish laying beside my rod and reel. the colour is nothing like a normal pike but the spotting on the tail and non-red fins means its definitely not a muskie as I had first thought. the flash washed out the grey colour a bit in this pic.  fought like a beast though!
1009933,manitoubass2,2017-07-26 16:27:00,11391,"I've never seen a pike like that! Cool!  I'll see if I dig up a pic I have of the coolest pike I've caught. It was half light coloured, half dark, split right down the middle"
1009934,AKRISONER,2017-07-26 16:47:00,5558,"totally a silver pike, look at the comparables on google...very cool"
1009936,J Roelofsen,2017-07-26 17:25:00,84,"I agree, definitely a color mutation....they are cool looking fish!  Josh"
1009943,fishboy,2017-07-26 18:33:00,550,Very cool-learned something too
1009945,lew,2017-07-26 18:59:00,12766,"I'll see if I dig up a pic I have of the coolest pike I've caught. It was half light coloured, half dark, split right down the middle  Sounds like this musky I got on the St. Lawrence River a couple years back, barred on the back half and clear on the front half.  Some kool looking fish swimming around our waters for sure.  "
1009950,John Bacon,2017-07-26 20:13:00,3277,spotting on the tail and non-red fins means its definitely not a muskie as I had first thought.   The shape of the fins and tail are a give away too.  Muskie fins and tail would not be as rounded as pike fins.
1009952,PUMP KNOWS,2017-07-26 21:35:00,937,That's cool.  Can you post the other pic?  try using tinypic.com
1009953,PUMP KNOWS,2017-07-26 21:38:00,937," Sounds like this musky I got on the St. Lawrence River a couple years back, barred on the back half and clear on the front half.

1009964,Canuck,2017-07-26 22:56:00,491,"Took another look on my PC with the larger image. WHat looks like spots in the small image is actually the scales that show up much more. Yup, I agree its a silver pike.  Neat."
1009967,manitoubass2,2017-07-26 23:07:00,11391,The lampreys agree
1009970,Duckie,2017-07-26 23:56:00,305,the other pic. the white spotting is so tiny the fish appears almost totally grey.  normal pike colouration is large white spots on a brown or green background.  this guy has tiny white spots on a grey background: 
1009971,Duckie,2017-07-26 23:58:00,305,that half and half musky is awesome
1010021,zenon11,2017-07-27 16:31:00,75,"On lake abitibi, the pike and walleye are always more white then green. I just figured it was from the tannins in the water."
