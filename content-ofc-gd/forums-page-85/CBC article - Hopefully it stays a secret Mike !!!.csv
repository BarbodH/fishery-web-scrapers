1010614,cheaptackle,2017-08-04 15:47:00,849,"Heard about it on 104.1 the dock yesterday - it was thumbs up for Mike and thumbs down for the idiot wanting to find out where to catch a fish without putting in an effort to research it his lazy butt hotspot jumping probably ain't gotta license anyhow miserable self (nope - not biased, not me!) Stick to yer guns Mike and everyone - fishery is in enough trouble as it is!  Michael"
1010618,OhioFisherman,2017-08-04 16:35:00,6623,"LOL, pretty sad, the dude won't even make an effort to stalk his fishing trips!"
1010621,Ronzo,2017-08-04 17:46:00,124,"I heard Mike on the radio last night. Mike, you did nothing wrong. It's unfortunate that society sucks. Hope you get to keep your spot a well-deserved secret."
1010622,msp,2017-08-04 18:09:00,1336,And I thought bass fishermen were bad. Geez
1010631,cheaptackle,2017-08-04 19:55:00,849,Did anyone else read the comments on the CBC article - guy claiming he knows who sent in the FOI request says they're trout nuts and just wanted to repeat Mike's experience.  Best part is where he says Mike should have give in right away and none of this publicity would ever have happened - as if!  Michael
1010639,buick14,2017-08-04 20:56:00,741,"Just Listened to the radio broadcast ; You are very well spoken Mike.  I am super angry that something like this could actually happen. Nevermind the nonsense , and keep doing what u do. What is this world coming to .."
1010650,Old Ironmaker,2017-08-05 00:32:00,8243,I sure hope some employee at the park doesn't get the bright idea to copy his itinerary then leak it like a lowly disgruntled White House staffer.
