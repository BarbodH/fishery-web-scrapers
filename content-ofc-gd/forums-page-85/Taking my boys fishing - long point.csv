Can anyone recommend a good spot (on a rock or dock) where they can get some fishing action? We don't have a boat. And my eldest is adamant that we purchase worms as well. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Kids are 8 and 5"

1010870,G.mech,2017-08-08 14:50:00,830,"Stop in at Old Cut Marina, they will have some bait for you and point you to a channel where the kids can fish without upsetting anyone.  They are on Rogers Ave off of Old Cut Blvd  which is the last road on your left before you get to the park (there's lots of signs).   There's lots of places to fish along all the channels but it's best to check first since many people don't like anyone fishing around their boats or private property."
