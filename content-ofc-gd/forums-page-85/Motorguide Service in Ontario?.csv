1010282,Oggie,2017-07-31 00:49:00,588,My ten year old Motorguide W55 bow mount finally refuses to pivot.  I'd like to avoid an expensive install so I'm looking to replace or repair the motor. It was a very common bow mount motor on many boats a decade ago but it's hard to find new ones now.  Anyone know of a reputable Motorguide repair outlet in the Barrie to Guelph to Owen sound to North Bay area.  LOL.  Thanks for any help.

I dealt with them on humminbird warranty and they where fantastic, I also bought some items for my sportspal canoe and they sent me extra hardware and a spare part.  I wouldn't hesitate to deal with them, I didn't know they serviced motor guide."
