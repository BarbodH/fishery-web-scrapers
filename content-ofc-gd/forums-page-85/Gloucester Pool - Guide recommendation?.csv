1010457,MSBruno,2017-08-02 13:46:00,369,Looking to hire a guide for the day ... anyone have any luck with anyone in particular?  
1010458,BillM,2017-08-02 14:27:00,17367,I dunno if I'd pay someone to show me around GPool to be honest.   Look at the maps and figure a few things out.  It's not a hard lake to fish.

Yup what he said. If I can do it on a toon, Im sure a guy with a motor boat can do it.  Bill, I was on the south west side during my 5 in 5. WOW, What great waters to fish."
1010490,dheitzner,2017-08-02 21:58:00,314,You could try Erik Luzak of Bass Class: he's a good guy and a knowledgeable teacher...also has a couple good guys that he works with if double booked. www.bassclass.ca
