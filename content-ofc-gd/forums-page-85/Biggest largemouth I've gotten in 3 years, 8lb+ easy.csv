1010369,Old Ironmaker,2017-08-01 03:03:00,8243,"I caught the ""longest"" Largemouth I ever saw. Not the heaviest, the longest. I didn't have a tape. I was fishing for Crappie believe it or not. It went from my finger tip to 1/2 way up my bicep. That is 23"". Get a tape and actually see what 23"" is. That isn't short. That Bass wasn't maybe 3"" thick. It was from a small quarry pond in October. It had to be starving. A 23"" Largie is huge. A Largemouth that long is close to 10 lbs. in Cuba or Mexico. I have an 8.7 pounder from inland Cuba under my belt 26 years ago and it was stupid fat, grotesque actually. Not anymore apparently from all the catch and mount fish taken I'm told from an old guide there I keep in touch with. That is one big Bass the OP has there. Most likely from Mexico or Cuba, maybe Okeechobee or a yet to be named southern lake and most likely a reservoir."

Most likely from Mexico or Cuba, maybe Okeechobee or a yet to be named southern lake and most likely a reservoir.  I have seen some at tournament weigh ins here, not that much farther south than you, here any 22 inch bass should break the 6 pound mark as long as it is healthy. Too much fishing pressure here on public waters, the vast majority of the really big bass here come from private ponds.  Years ago the fishing magazines were talking about Cuba for the next record bass.  Had a couple of hogs hooked at private ponds, but never broke 22 inches, got a smallie on Erie that was right there, but no scale."
1010378,Old Ironmaker,2017-08-01 04:15:00,8243,"So like I thought my Buckeye pal, 23"" is a big Momma Largie. Never fish for them, always a bonus fish here."
1010380,OhioFisherman,2017-08-01 04:47:00,6623,"For sure Old, LOL, I would have been happy with more 19-20 inch fish on tournament days! One of my buddies sons weighed in a 7 pound 2 ounce smallie at a tournament in New York we had, it made his 5 pound fish look small."
1010388,AKRISONER,2017-08-01 13:19:00,5558,"Their all B.C buckets . Which harbour most likely the largest LM in the country . Much like Northern California trout eating bass. No reason there isn't a double digit swimming in those waters. No one cares about them out there and most likely has the lake to himself.  this...  i got intel on a few local ponds that held largies but never got the chance to give it a go. I saw some kids targeting them on a golf course in pitt meadows, they were jumping everywhere would have been easy fishing  ive also heard that the smallmouth fishing can bring 8lbers in the kootenays but no one knows how nor give s a single turd about it."

1009978,moxie,2017-07-27 02:40:00,1566,LMAO!!! Funny how everyone's tune changed. I caught one that rung a regular sprimg scale at 8.5 so it was probably mid 7s. I belive it.  Congrats.   Edited due to fat fingers.

1009477,Nateraz,2017-07-20 03:03:00,6,"On Sunday, I was at a local lake, not expecting much. I was rewarded with an absolutely gorgeous summertime largemouth bass. She was 23.5"" and as fat as can be. I'll throw in a picture of a 7lb 6lz largie I got earlier this year. She was released after the pictures. I am posting here as I would like to see what you guys think of her size. I did have a good scale with me, and I weighed her on it, the scale spat out 4.11, but I did not see lbs after 4.11, I believe I accidentally switched the scale to kg in the excitement, but I'll leave that up for you guys to decide. All I know, is this was not my typical 8lber.... "
1009478,LittleWorm,2017-07-20 03:23:00,122,"Welcome to the fourms! Thats a tank man, nice catch."
1009484,PUMP KNOWS,2017-07-20 04:10:00,937,Big gut on it.  Anymore pics?
1009485,John Bacon,2017-07-20 04:18:00,3277,Kind of hard to judge the size when the fish is closer to the camera than it is to you   There is no such thing as a 'typical 8lber' in Ontario.  Largemouth that size are pretty rare in Ontario.
1009486,OhioFisherman,2017-07-20 04:49:00,6623,I don't have a problem believing a 23.5 inch L/M could be around 7.5 pounds.
1009487,glen,2017-07-20 06:45:00,2641,That pic looks like a 6 lb bass.  going by the size of your hand. Congrats on a great fish.
1009489,singingdog,2017-07-20 11:39:00,1047,"Something up with your scale. That's a really nice fish, but not a 9 lb LM."
1009493,colin519,2017-07-20 12:15:00,101,"Ya sorry great looking fishy, but that's a 5.5 or 6lb bass. I'd believe 4.11 to be honest. I'd love to see the 7lber you've got.  4.11 kg is 9 pounds+ and that just isn't even remotely possible.  Using the fishermans trophy pose isn't helping either."
1009497,Brettiop,2017-07-20 12:37:00,279,Looks a lot bigger then 4.11 no doubt in my mind anyways  If that is only 4.11 my biggest large mouth weighs about 1.8 lbs lol  the pic posted is the one in question right? Throw up the pic of the 7.6lber I would love to see that
1009508,lookinforwalleye,2017-07-20 14:16:00,4399,You have typical 8 pounders....impressive
1009511,brooktrout88,2017-07-20 14:21:00,6,Nice fish dude. Imagine over six which is very rare around here. Congrats that's a toad!
1009512,Old Ironmaker,2017-07-20 14:22:00,8243,"Regardless if the kid looks to be standing 3 feet behind the Bass, look at the relationship of his entire hand to the lower jaw, that's a big fish. No idea how much it weights."
1009514,manitoubass2,2017-07-20 14:29:00,11391,My guess is a tad over six  The pic is deceiving but like OI said look at the mouth  It is a big largie no doubt about it!
1009515,brooktrout88,2017-07-20 14:32:00,6,"Nice fish dude. No idea on weight, but imagine over 5 1/2. Regardless a toad for are area. Congrats!"

1009535,AKRISONER,2017-07-20 16:01:00,5558,"i believe the fish is 7 lbs...it could be 9 you never know! ive seen 6lb looking fish go 4, ive seen 4 lb fish go over 5 all the bloody time.  Thats why its important to weigh fish rather than make claims...the amount of ""5lbers"" i hear people catch...put it on a good scale"
1009541,manitoubass2,2017-07-20 16:54:00,11391,"Exactly!  My PB is 6lbs, my son's is 6lbs 4oz but it doesn't really look that big. But that belly!"
1009553,porkpie,2017-07-20 18:07:00,2521,Nice fish.  You'll quickly learn not to post weights or any other claim.  Someone will always take a run at em!
1009556,glen,2017-07-20 18:37:00,2641,We need an app that tells the weight of a fish in a picture.  Maybe the location it was caught also.  And what lure and time of day and what line and rod and reel.
1009559,RangerGuy,2017-07-20 18:46:00,564,"Nice bucket for sure... one thing to note, and I'm not being a jerk, because you can't get away from seeing the hot shot tv/internet/tournament personalities doing it..  The hero shot hanging a fish from the bottom lip, is not conducive to good catch and release practices.  Please don't hold your fish vertical..  Otherwise great fish dude congrats!"
1009567,John Bacon,2017-07-20 19:41:00,3277,Actually vertically is usually okay for bass; not so much for other species.  It's tilting the bass at an angle while only holding the lower lip that will injure a bass.
1009575,misfish,2017-07-20 20:20:00,29133,Nice fish  This is a legit 4.5 that I thought was a nickle+. Til I put the scale to it. I think the over size bellies on these fish make them look much bigger. IMO  
1009576,Old Ironmaker,2017-07-20 20:26:00,8243,Best to hold a big Bass by the lower lip and under the belly with the other horizontally. You can hold a good size Smallie with one hand under the belly and it doesn't move a muscle.
1009580,aplumma,2017-07-20 20:57:00,6896,No matter the weight very nice fish for sure. I live down South and our bass have a longer growing season so a Northern bass that size is amazing.  Welcome to the board.  Art
1009619,Nateraz,2017-07-21 02:42:00,6,"It's not letting me post more pictures. If I could, I would show you how big this fish actually was, I just have no clue how to post pics, it's saying the pic is too big. If you really want more pics, DM me on Instagram, fish.and.destroy I already have a 7lb 6oz bass with a scale in my hand this year under my belt, I assure you guys, this thing was at least a pound bigger,vthat fish is also on my Instagram"
