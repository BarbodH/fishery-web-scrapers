404344,sconceptor,2009-11-21 00:33:00,146,"Yeah, what about guide/line freeze up gels and pastes?  I see Frabil sells a product for ice fishing.  Anybody use it for steelheading or ice fishing, and how well does it work?   I'd like to pick something up to try before things are freezing and I'm having so suck the ice off every 15minutes or so.  What do you use?  Is vaseline, pretty good?"
404346,Paulus,2009-11-21 00:40:00,522," The weather will hold I think.  Mike, that was without a doubt some of your finest writing. THat was a great description of a quintessential fall steelheading trip. Excellent work, my friend. In fact, if you don't mind, I'd like to conserve it on my blog - with special mention of course.  Thanks for making me look (and sound) good, too. Laird knows dat airn't easy! Whut a hat!  p.-"
404350,TDunn,2009-11-21 01:03:00,680, I paid $42 US for a michigan license for all species. Not sure about the other states but I bought mine online.....http://www.mdnr-elicense.com/welcome.asp   Great report Solo....Looked like an awesome day! Wish I was there!!! I always look forward to your trib reports!   TDunn
404354,solopaddler,2009-11-21 01:20:00,8605," Well first off I build my rods with larger guides, that helps a lot. When it's really cold there's a product called Stanleys Ice Off Paste that works pretty well. Nothing is foolproof though when it gets that cold.    Geez buddy coming from you that's some heady praise. Feel free to immortalize me any way you like. My finest writing? I had both kids today, sat down at noon and whipped it off in about an hour. Maybe I should put a little more effort into it LOL!  Once again thanks everyone for the kind words."
404358,trapshooter,2009-11-21 01:32:00,1234,Good stuff Mike.  I know you live for days like that.  As I've told you before.... get back into writing... you have a real way with words.
404361,tonyb,2009-11-21 01:52:00,1637,"Unreal Mike...some really pretty fish, in fact they all are!  Did they all succomb to the caviar or was there some other stuff mixed in?"
404364,BillM,2009-11-21 02:01:00,17367," It was in the morning   Forgot my gloves, once my hands got cold that was it.  Went out the next day and got some nice ones from Marks Work Wearhouse... No more cold hands for me!  I was excited to get the rod back also, lol  Fished the Notty later that day, did ok."
404366,drwxr,2009-11-21 02:08:00,453,"Amazing pictures and a well written story. Solo have you ever considered taking a fly or spey outfit so that the guys with pins at least had a chance against you, also making it more challenging for you. Thanks for taking time to share your trip moments."
404382,BillM,2009-11-21 02:55:00,17367,"I grease Mike out any chance I get, it really doesn't help."
404430,Paulus,2009-11-21 04:53:00,522," Sometimes it's the first inspiration that is the finest. Too much editing after that, or too much hankering after the ""perfect"" word can dilute the feeling that made you write in the first place, thereby diluting the writing itself. Romanticism, 19th century stuff: writing for the love of writing. Of course, if your editing is inspired, then the final product will be that much better (imagism). But this is very often unnecessary. Use the force, dood!  Regardless, I've read it over three times already, because I can't help it. That's how good it is.  Turning out the lights now. Good luck tomorrow. We'll share reports!  p.-"
404446,laszlo,2009-11-21 11:38:00,487,and here i am all happy about landing 2 smaller sized fish.  :/  nicely done!
404451,Roy,2009-11-21 12:13:00,13728,"Just a super picture essay, Mike. Yanno, when I read your report threads now, I kinda get the Rudyard Kipling feeling....ole Ruddy didn't fish did he?  Great thread Mike and thanks for putting it together for us."
404453,FLEX ROD,2009-11-21 12:34:00,394,"Like always Mike, when I log on the first thing I look for is to see I you have a post up, thank you once again for brightening my day up.  Again, I can not go out but through you I still get my chrome fix, okay maybe not a fix just a adiction fix  Oh the basement is almost done and I will be back out chasing soon, last two years it was the damn knee and this year the basement but soon  FLEX"
404480,ehg,2009-11-21 16:28:00,2666,"Very nicely written there Mike, reminds me of a Field and Stream type article written by the Marlboro Man.  What i noticed when reading the post, was the depth of information to be gleaned. By paying attention to the details and putting out that physical effort needed, you found success.  Very nice      There is so many fish that day one swam through your legs, just noticed."
404610,solopaddler,2009-11-22 02:52:00,8605,"  Thanks Erik, but the Marlboro Man?  I didn't notice the fish between my legs either LOL!  Thanks for the kind words everyone."
404758,ehg,2009-11-22 23:04:00,2666,"Simply should have said this Mike, ""well written great fishing story"". Thanks!"
404767,StoneFly,2009-11-22 23:41:00,574," what was that all about?  How could a Steelhead just be swimming between your legs like that?  lol,..I have had that happen with nooks when a school is running up,..almost knocked me on my Butt,....but that fish looks like a puppy waiting to get petted,..lol,..whats the story?"
404772,irishfield,2009-11-22 23:57:00,26272,If you ever see Mike walking to the river.. you'll notice he has a hard sided 6 pack cooler with him. It contains his Pet fish... it swims out and finds some bigger cousins for Mike to play with.
404773,walleye_man,2009-11-22 23:59:00,135,nice fish beauty colors congrats
404811,StoneFly,2009-11-23 02:55:00,574," LOL... LOL again,..that was funny,..Im gonna have to try that..."
404841,solopaddler,2009-11-23 11:11:00,8605," Right on the cooler, but no fish just a 6 pack.  Truth be told these were the photos that were lost when my picture file vanished. Paul somehow managed to retrieve these ones, but still half of them were lost. They weren't in any order and it was difficult to insert them chronologicaly for my story. The pic with the fish between my legs is the same 2 fish from the earlier double header I'd chronicled. Easy mistake to make...these darn fish all look alike."
404989,Skud,2009-11-23 22:20:00,739,Well written report Mike. Some awesome pics of fish. Such beautiful creatures.  I like the action shots too.
405114,Moosebunk,2009-11-24 06:53:00,3970,Nuthin' short of cold rainy day spectacular fun Mr. Solo and Co.  Nice work fellers!!!
404239,solopaddler,2009-11-20 19:58:00,8605,"It was one of those days. Gale force winds and horizontal precipitation buffeted the car as we made our way north. Arriving in town in the pre dawn darkness I had a sudden moment of inspiration when passsing a bank of drive-in car wash bays. While I had no need to rid my vehicle of filth we pulled in out of the storm and donned our gear in relative comfort. Seems the nasty weather had scared off most other anglers as well. When we met Bill at the parking lot high above the river ours were the only two cars. We had a good look at the river as we picked our way down the steep hill: higher than normal with a definite tinge to it from earlier rains. It was absolutely prime. It's a great feeling when you absolutely know the day will be a good one before you even start. When we arrived at the river bank Bill and Paul slipped downstream in the gloom. A jaunty little seam on the far side of a mid river island had caught their attention. I headed off on my own, carefully wading across the broad expanse of river to reach the other side. Several hundred yards upstream was a neckdown and a short run of wild white river. I started there. With no other anglers in sight I took my time, carefully selecting the right vantage point then turning my back to the relentless wind to alter my rig and bait up. It was great holding water but shallower. I shortened my lead and lengthened my tippet slightly, adding a couple of larger split shots near the float so that it would right itself instantly in the churning current. With my fingers already stiff and cold I fumbled with the jar of freshly tied roe finally managing to impale one on the slender #12 hook. First cast sailed high and off the mark as a huge gust of wind suddenly whipped up. I quickly retrieved my line and managed to flip my float onto the edge of the seam 40' in front of me. The wind was wreaking havoc with my drift as I had no control over my float, it wasn't tracking straight and was tipping over and being pushed back upstream in the gale. Reeling in again I remembered an old trick. Fishing in my pack I dug out a bag of larger split shot, the ones I'd normally use when throwing Flatfish. I clamped one onto my mainline 6"" above the float and managed to hit the seam in front of me once again. The split shot above the float did it's job keeping my line from being whipped upstream and ruining the drift. It wasn't perfect but definitely better. The float bobbed and danced downstream doing the rumba along the edge of a foam line. The hit wasn't violent, in fact the float barely moved, just subtly toppling over sideways. Nevertheless I struck hard and was immediately warmed by the tell tale headshakes of a solid fish. I quickly reeled in my line gaining on the fish and turned into the face of the wind when suddenly the fish went ballistic. It cartwheeled out of the water in a shower of spray and shot downstream in flash. The power and speed were breathtaking. I stumbled after it for about 10 seconds when abruptly everything went slack, the fish was gone. Not a bad start I thought as I reeled in and sat down on a rock. Hunkering down into my goretex I reached into my pocket to light a smoke and take stock of the situation with the icy wind whipping tendrils of cold all around me. This is what it's all about I thought, it just doesn't get any better.  After working the run for a good 45 mins with nothing to show for my efforts I slid downstream to see how the boys were making out.  Paul, sly devil that he is, had managed a couple.    Things had slowed downstream as well though. I fished across from them for a while with no luck, then as if on cue we slowly began to wade our way back over to the car for a conference. Paul lagged behind fishing as he went, while Bill and I discussed the situation. He was feeling the effects of the bitter wind and had decided to pack it in for the day. I tried to talk him out of it, but he was chilled to the bone and eager for the warmth of his car. After saying our goodbyes Paul and I were undaunted. After a pit stop for some hot java we decided to nose our way further up river. With the water running high it was a good bet that the fish had shot past us and were holding upstream. We drove across to the south side and parked close to the dam, picking our way down the rain slick rocky trail to the river. There were only a handful of hardy souls working the tailout of the dam pool, plenty of room for us to squeeze in, but we walked on. After fishing this river for almost 30 years you tend to learn a few tricks. Even with the foul weather the lack of people was strange. Usually if the fish are in the people are there. ""Well buddy"" I said to Paul, ""This'll either be boom or bust, we'll find out pretty quickly"". We worked downstream a long way to an area where a high clay bank was at our backs. The deeper water was on our side of the river and our casts would be shorter and easier to control in the wind. I waded over to a table top flat rock about four feet from shore and climbed up, Paul worked his way about 100yds downstream from me and set up on a nice seam at the tailout.  The wind almost knocked me off the slime coated rock until I could get a grip with my spikes. Before we could begin, boiling black towering cumulous clouds skudded across the sky releasing a volley of ice pellets mixed with rain. We turned our backs on the stinging deluge 'till it abated and were given a brief window.  It was deeper here so I stretched out my float and split shot and added a bit of dust shot to the tippet. I normally cast directly across the current and allow the float to drift downstream with the bait invariably swinging ahead of the float and shot in the current.  The expected hookups almost always occur downstream. Sometimes far downstream. This time I heaved a cast quartering upstream. The float cocked and the shot and tippet straightened out and set up perfectly directly across from me. Surprisingly the float shot down with authority. I knew it was a fish before I even reared back on the rod. Because it was directly across from me and not very far away my angle was perfect and I drove the hook home solidly. Nothing happened for a split second...it felt as though I had set the hook into a bowling ball. Then the water erupted. A very angry chrome fish bolted downstream in a flash as I struggled to slip off my rocky perch. Suddenly I wasn't cold anymore as the adrenaline surged. The fish made half a dozen lightning fast runs, my centrepin reel spinning wildly. Twice it ran directly at me and I madly reeled in the single action reel and back pedaled lifting my rod high to gain line. This fish was mine though and we were soon admiring it's brilliance as it lay at my feet in the shallows.    So fresh and chrome it's scales were dropping off when I gently lifted her for a quick photo.    Now that's more like it.  Steelheading is never a sure bet. There are so many days where you struggle and scratch for a couple of fish, sometimes none. It makes you appreciate the truly great days like a gift from above. This as it turned out was a special day. Shortly afterwards we both set the hook into chrome bright fish....a double! Laughing like kids as we stumbled around on the slick bank trying to keep our fish away from the other. It was madness.      The rest of the afternoon was a blur. There were many, many fish hooked. Some were landed, the majority gained their freedom with a wild show of acrobatics.        Make no mistake these fish were strong. While not enormous in size they were mostly wild fish and used the power of the big river to their full adavantage. Still, the long soft rods, shock absorbers really, were able to subdue their share:                There really is nothing better than a wild fresh run November steelhead. Numb fingers, runny noses, cold rain and sleet are a small price to pay.                 We fished the rest of the day 'till the light grew dimmer, slowly fading to a cold grayness in the bleak November twilight.    By the time we made it back to the truck it was fully dark. I started it up to get the heater going and slipped off my cold wet wool gloves. I held my cold trembling fingers tight to the blast of warm air emanating from my dash, trying to coax some feeling back into my tortured digits. Within seconds they turned an angry shade of red and the feeling slowly seeped back. As we peeled off the layers and changed into dry fleece I poured Paul and I small shot of Jamaicas finest. Burning and warming our insides as we toasted the day.  ""Cheers my friend, this is what it's all about!"""
