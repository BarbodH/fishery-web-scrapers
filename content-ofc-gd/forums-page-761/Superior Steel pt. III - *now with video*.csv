After gearing up and having a quick beverage we hit the river.  I had my first 3lb hen in before the other two gents even had their lines tied up.  And they wonder why I tie up the night before.  In total today I went 3 for 5 due to a few breakoffs...       Tight lines!"

404838,laszlo,2009-11-23 10:52:00,487,Way to go. I can now say I know what that feels like.  Awesome!

I like the vid and pics, keep it up.   Also can't believe how high it is....like a foot or more from last fall. Might have to head down there at christmas, could be interesting to get out though."
