404077,Marc Thorpe,2009-11-20 11:31:00,621,"When the issue broke out,I emailed the biologist in question and I am sure many also invloved thought of the same solution Looks like they are gonna use the solution which may prevent an invasive disater  http://www.suburbanchicagonews.com/bolingb...-091114.article"
404085,corvette1,2009-11-20 12:57:00,1765,its about time
404146,bassmaster4,2009-11-20 15:07:00,801,"im glad to hear that they will be doing that, i really hope it works though"
404202,tonyb,2009-11-20 17:43:00,1637,Rotenone was used to rid Simcoe of Round Gobies...how'd that work out anyway?
404212,Mike Pike,2009-11-20 18:11:00,1332,The first time I heard of rotenone was in the sci-fi classic The Creature From The Black Lagoon.  Didn't work on the Creature either as there were two 2 sequels.
404219,cuzza,2009-11-20 18:31:00,467,LOL @ Mike  I assume this stuff breaks down pretty quickly otherwise it'll just end up in the great lakes like the carp would - or am I missing the point?
404221,irishfield,2009-11-20 18:37:00,26272," Yep, you're missing the fact that the water flows OUT of the great lakes into the river system in question in Chicago."
404230,cuzza,2009-11-20 19:24:00,467,"Oops - can I play my ""new in north america"" card now?  While I was looking at a map on Google I looked up Rotenone - it breaks down in sunlight and last 6 days tops so presumebalty won't get too far in that time"
404249,mikeymikey,2009-11-20 20:31:00,376,Asian carp may have breached barrier  http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/techno...article1371407/
404297,misfish,2009-11-20 22:40:00,29133,"  Didnt Tony. They are still here.   Hey Mark,that musky wasnt that big.You couldnt break a smile for the pic ?.LOL  Enjoyed your comments."
404299,Terry,2009-11-20 22:42:00,14456,they only hit the river with Rotenone  but the gobies were already in simcoe
404320,misfish,2009-11-20 23:41:00,29133," Yep.Big thing about that when they did that.Killed off alot of forage fish,and no gobies to be seen floating."
404425,fishinguypat,2009-11-21 04:38:00,547,this is very bad ...if they have to kill all the fish in an area to get rid of the asian carp...i guess it's the only way
404442,Marc Thorpe,2009-11-21 10:57:00,621,"Brian if I break a smile,I'd be breaking tradition  Then winter would never come from the glow  They are only treating partially the river(locks) with Rotenone to work on the electric barriers The entire system needs sterilization  It wont solve entirely the problem. Good thing is they are goona shock,remove and preserve what ever game fish they can capture during the process and then re-introduce them and stocking afterward"
404447,Radnine,2009-11-21 11:41:00,1538,"I have read the articles posted and defer to the expertise of the people involved (including in this community). But I am basically opposed to messing with nature too much. From Purple Lustrife, which was going to take away all of the water, to H1N1 that is going to kill us all, to Pike that are going to eat all of the fish in Rice Lake, I tend to err on the side of caution. I have no pedigree to back it up (I am not Jimmy-two egos) but a healthy dose of cynicism has served me reasonably well so far. Jim"
404450,Chris,2009-11-21 12:09:00,405,"The one thing I find hard to believe is that a 150lb fish can eat 40 times it weight each day. That's 6,000lbs of food each day. Can that be true?"
404538,John Bacon,2009-11-21 23:14:00,3277," I noticed that too.  I think it is safe to say that no, a 150 pound fish will not eat 6,000 pounds of food every day."
404561,Dusky,2009-11-22 00:14:00,310,"There is an article at msnbc today, seems asian carp is invading great lakes.  http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/34079964/ns/us_news-environment"
404761,theRJ,2009-11-22 23:15:00,55,The best part is that they aren't even trying to eliminate them permanently. It is just an extreme measure to ensure no carp can get through while the electro-barrier is shut down for maintenance. So they are going to do it again next time maintenance is needed.  RJ
404766,StoneFly,2009-11-22 23:38:00,574,"LMBO,..that would be ALOT of FISH poop"
404768,dave524,2009-11-22 23:44:00,4508," Some other article it was said they can eat 40% of their body weight a day, a bit more beleiveable. Reporters"
404793,outllaw,2009-11-23 01:28:00,1232,"this just amazes me. flying carp. the authorities have missed the boat. there been numerous reports of these fish in erie already. between shipping ballast and poor aquaculture we have developed a b-movie for science fiction.. instead of being a baitmaker,,,maybe i should be selling hemets and pads to boaters."
