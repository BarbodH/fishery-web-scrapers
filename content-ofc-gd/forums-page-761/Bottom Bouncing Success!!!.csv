She had fished ""bows"" with spinners and spoons this year on a few outings...caught her first ever (6lb hen) on a Blue Fox spinner. We were fishing the rivers on this particular weekend, the water was prime and I had gone three for three on some smaller chrome beauties.  Having never fished roe before, and, not hitting a thing on lures she was game to try something different. On her third ever, yes third!!!!!!!!!, drift she hooked into a beautiful 26"" chrome male steelhead!!!!!!  Needless to say she is hooked for life after the ensuing battle!"
