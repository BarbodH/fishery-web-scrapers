Where do the smallmouths go when the weather turns cold and there's no water deeper than 4' to be found? I doubt they all emigrate to Erie, if they can even get there. Do they just find a comfy spot between two rocks and hunker down or do they really travel around looking for hidy oles?  Enquiring minds and all that.  JF"

Mid Nov til closer, they seemed to be on the move and could be found in deeper areas....there were a few holes I fished that got to 6 or 8 feet. Seemed like on overcast days they would move to the head or tail of a large pool. Did my best with 3"" natural coloured grubs this time of year. White occassionaly took a fish.  I suspect for survial that bass will travel a fair distance to find a suitable area to winter within rivers.  I found large concentrations in these holes that were a few km from my spots in Oct...who knows if they are the same fish.  Any bridges? Ususally some deeper, slower water around bridge piliings."
