404347,Ron,2009-11-21 00:42:00,1683,"Very well written and descriptive Mike. It is nice to see all the responses on here, positive and not positive alike.  We have worked on these regulation changes long before the advisory council had even been formed. I have received feedback from many people and for the most of it, I feel like I have accomplished something in my volunteer time with the MNR.  If the MNR are reading this, which I am certain they will, I wish to say thanks for listening to us and the majority of avid anglers I represented. With such diverse stakeholders representing the council:  Anglers – Recreational and Competitive Bait Industry Buckhorn District Tourism Association City of Kawartha Lakes Tourism Cold Creek Flyfishers Crowe Lake Waterway Association Curve Lake First Nation Muskies Canada Ontario BASS Federation Nation Ontario Chinese Anglers Association Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters Peterborough Field Naturalists Rice Lake Tourist Association Stewardship Councils Trent University As you can see, it wasn't just a few die hard fishermen or just a couple of resort owners or just a couple of fishing clubs. We all had input and we all understood and listened to both sides to come up with what we all agreed on (well most of the time) would be best for the fish, not the fishing industry.  Cudos to everyone for their time and dedication spent!  Cheers, Ron..."
404352,MCTFisher9120,2009-11-21 01:16:00,3761,"My guess is to let up on the constant year round pressure on Lake Scugog. Good on them for changing the regs, maybe for 5 or so years to let Scugog bounce back a bit.  Ah well, it think it's all because of me. First year Ice fishing and all these great lakes to fish.  Life is good, MTBF"
404360,Weeds,2009-11-21 01:38:00,782,"Maybe no one cares other than me but, I was hoping for some confirmation, come 2010 Carp becomes open year round, right?"
404365,Beans,2009-11-21 02:03:00,3339," You are not alone Weeds...I am wonderin' the same thing along with catfish and WGSF (rockbass)  I have enquired about icefishing for carp on a carp board to find out techniques, bait etc.  One problem as far as I can see is that most open water in the winter is below dams and those waters are mostly fish sanctuaries so no fishing for any species..."
404368,Michael_Brown,2009-11-21 02:21:00,411,"To the die hard carp anglers. The beauty of the regulation changes is that yes the carp and other non-classified species such as rockbass, ling, catfish and the elusive logperch will be open for year-round angling. The current regulations effectively placed a moratorium on all angling from Nov 15 until the fourth sat in April. This will no longer be in place. These fanatstic species will open on Jan 1, 2010 and will not close.  Also to Mike the Bass Fisher, it is not just the pressure on scugog that will be reduced but also the Haliburton lakes with their sensitive lake trout populations and other surrounding lakes. Sure anglers will still go there to enjoy the fishery but when you want a feed of tasty crappies or just to get the kids out for a nice afternoon in Feb. The Kawartha's will be open for family fishing fun.  Curious note. I have caught catfish, bass, muskie and other species through the ice as incidental catches. I have never caught a carp through the ice. Smart fish.   To Ron Reyns; For over three years of monthly meetings you have represented the anglers of this region as a stakeholder on the fisheries advsiory council and made a huge impact. Your advice, insight and passion for the sport we love has been reflected in these changes.  On behalf of all the anglers and future anglers who will enjoy even one extra day of angling because of your volunteer work.  Thank You."

404675,Rice Laker,2009-11-22 15:53:00,24,"As a resident on Rice Lake, I would like to add some comments to recent postings here. Michael Brown wrote:  ""The 300 number for sunfish is due to the fact that most anglers fishing for sunfish are from the US. Surveys indicated that the average US angler travelling here was taking home just over 200 sunfish for a weeks fishing so this number will allow those anglers to still enjoy their week of fishing"" The problem with this assumption is that it is an average. If one angler has 600 and the next 4 anglers have 100, the average is 200. The problem for tourism is that the 600 guy will not come back (and reaction for US guests in the last week is exactly that, there have been many cancellations for 2010).  Bluegills have always been considered an “invasive species” since they first appeared in Rice Lake in the mid-1960's. The biologists in the Dept. of Lands & Forests (the predecessor of the MNR) at the time strongly urged many bluegills to be caught as they were worried that they would “take over the lake”. Local anglers typically do not want to catch and keep bluegills and this is why US anglers were encouraged to come and take as many as possible, especially in May and June.  It is obvious to anyone that fishes or lives on Rice Lake that there are far fewer boats out on the lake than there used to be. This is true and MNR creel surveys indicate this decline in the number of sunfish caught. Eight surveys have been done on Rice over the last 30 years. The last 4 surveys show the annual sunfish catch as:  1995----515,464 2000----668,187 2004----836,726 2008----496,218  The non-resident licence sales match this decline as well (50% in 5 years). Sunfish have always been abundant in Rice Lake and the numbers will now increase even more. Assuming a steady annual decline between 2004 and 2008 (85,125 per year) there are now 340,500 MORE fish in the lake than there would have been if the catch numbers had been constant. These fish will also be spawning so the numbers in the lake will continue to increase. Initial feedback from the US in the last week is that the 300 per visit limit will continue the decline in US anglers, so the number of sunfish will increase even more. It is debatable which other species will be “crowded out” and go into decline.  Michael mentioned that there are not enough larger males and this very true for Rice Lake, no one argues this point. The Rice Lake Tourist Association, with the MNR's assistance, introduced a voluntary throwback asking that any bluegill bigger than 7"" be returned. This programme was started in 2005 and the 2008 survey showed that it was working- the average size was larger, not much but at least going in the right direction. I am still having difficulty understanding why an angler can keep 30 larger fish when the opposite is what is biologically required. This was NOT what the FMZ 17 Council recommended. Why does walleye have a size restriction and not bluegill?  One other factor that may come into play is global warming. With the lake warming up earlier and staying warm longer, this fits perfectly the sunfish and bass spawning requirements. This will also be to the detriment of other species such as walleye that prefer cooler water."

405051,Skud,2009-11-24 01:26:00,739,"I know I would love to try for pike in Canal and Balsam immediately after the ice breaks up. I am sure there will be no bass, walleye or musky in a foot of water in April."

Yes, that means Scugog is still open for walleye fishing through the ice.  OFAH website announcement  ""... Under the new regulations, dozens of area lakes, including such popular angling destinations as Sturgeon, Balsam, Buckhorn, Chemong, and Rice Lake, will see winter fishing seasons for bluegill, yellow perch and black crappie. Walleye seasons will remain closed during the winter in F.M.Z. 17 with the exception of where they previously existed on Lake Scugog, Crowe Lake and the lower Trent River.""   Great job to all of those involved on this change, just hope they will have enough CO's to check on the possible walleye poachers."

Its going to be a learning experience for sure. Just wait till the no parking signs go up too!! Its funny, you open up a fishing season, and the whole area will get locked down with no parking signs! Just wait until the ice fisherman see me smashing the ice to get out after ducks.........

I have to admit, it will be nice on one of those beautiful winter days to be able to jump on my bike and get a fresh feed of nice crappie or perch. Sturgeon isn't much different than Scugog as far as ice conditions are concerned, some dangerous spots but if you don't know, you shouldn't go anyway.  I don't think the pressure on the new lakes will be too bad, you don't get the jumbo perch here like you do on Simco, no white fish, no pike, no lake trout. Trust me I'll be watching for anyone taking walleye in my area and believe me if I see it, I will report it and I have a very good telescope and can see a lot right from my dining room!  Apart from that, no one has any ice fishing experience on the new lakes, it will take a long time for people to figure out the patterns and and a few trips with little results will make a lot of people go back to the areas they know produce fish.  Over all, I think it will be good for the areas bait and tackle shops and and many others."

We actually carry tools to check the ice depth. Some other groups just drive faster and hope for the best. Wise and safe decisions should be used always on the ice, new lake or not. Take your time, do your research, ask questions and get out and enjoy this great new angling adventure.  Just a note, please read the new changes completely. Sanctuaries will continue to take effect in Mid-november. Fast water areas and causeways will be off-limits through the winter."

I think their minds freeze, preventing them from making safe decisions. Anyone that lives on the lakes should keep an eye out for anyone that is poaching walleye/muskie/bass and call the TIPS line."

404186,Tom McCutcheon,2009-11-20 16:57:00,627,  Are you serious????  The reason for the open season on Pike is to try and cut down on this invasive species.
404204,GregF2,2009-11-20 17:48:00,46,"Does anyone think that the MNR's decision to allow ice fishing contradicts it decision to have limits on panfish?   So, one end, you limit the panfish fishery, but yet on the other end you allow ice fishing, so that allows a chance to have more panfish harvested?  Makes absolutely no sense to me.  I don't mind the restrictions and limits on walleye and panfish to help preserve fishing for future generations, but opening up ice fishing will not help.  I guess my opinion is in the minority, but it also comes from fishing Rice Lake for over 40 years."
404215,gone_fishin,2009-11-20 18:16:00,481," i think the limits for sunfish are there for Rice lake alone... Bluegills and Pumpkinseeds are the 2 most sought after species in Rice Lake, believe it or not... Thousands of Americans come up every year and take home coolers full of them. i think the limit is in place to restrict how many they are taking home, but still not deter them from coming up here."
404218,linweir,2009-11-20 18:28:00,202,"All I mean is new regs allow us use big lures such as spinnerbaits, jerkbaits to fish pike on these lakes all year. For sure will catch more out-of-season fish like Muskie and Bass.  Wonder if it's a good ideal or not."
404225,gone_fishin,2009-11-20 19:04:00,481," how about you think about it this way... how many lakes in Zone 17 have Pike in them... aside from Balsam, cause i don't think it will fly with a CO that you're actually fishing for Pike there... i could be wrong, but it's a far cry from first... most of the lakes that do have a fishable population of pike, they have more or less taken over the lake... at least taken over in the sense that most (or all) of the musky are gone. take Dalrymple and Canal as examples... the musky are nearly extinct in these lakes, if not already extinct. sure you'll catch some OOS bass, but that will be no different to any other lakes where Pike are open before Bass (which is everywhere i can think of).  a couple things i don't totally agree with on the new changes are as follows:  limit on Crappie... they are an invasive species to these lakes (welcomed by some, not by others), and the gov't has acknowledged that fact... so why put a limit on them, when these fish will obviously impact the other sport fish in these lakes???  also, why put a slot on Sunfish and not Perch? if you can only keep 30 Sunfish over 7.1 inches... why not make a similar rule for Perch? for example: if the limit is 50 Perch, only 10 can be over 10 inches... when i was young we would catch a lot of big perch in Rice lake, but now i haven't seen a 10 or 11 inch perch out of there in years.  And the positives...  i love the new slot for Walleye... in years to come there will be some MONSTERS in the kawarthas... everything over 20 inches has to go back... that means every fish in there right now that is already at that size can not be harvested or even kept to be mounted and will only get bigger!!! also, all the cigars have to go back giving them a chance to grow to at least reasonable eating size!  and the raised legal musky size is great too...  looking forward to fishing some of these lakes this winter!"
404236,Steelcat,2009-11-20 19:47:00,191,"Remember one thing though... with the new HST coming which means everything will be more expensive (gas, boat rental, cottage rental, food), and for Rice Lake, since getting a conservation license will only allow people to get 15 sunfish, that means people will be forced to get the full license...  Combine all these additional costs, I'm sure many friends from the south or from anywhere will want to come back... cost a lot more for a lot less fish.  One of the resort owner on Rice Lake already said they'll most probably lost 3/4 of their customers from the states due to the limits and the cost."
404288,bigfish1965,2009-11-20 22:06:00,3382,"The economy may keep people away, but limits never will. Anyone coming strictly for a feed can buy it at the grocery store for far less than it will ever cost no matter what the limit."
404304,Michael_Brown,2009-11-20 23:01:00,411,"Well said Rick. Remember most people fear change because of the unknown. The cottage resorts on Simcoe had similar fears before they put a 50 fish limit on perch but they have actually increased their business since.  As for the limits on panfish. They will be region wide. The main fish expected to be targeted in the winter will be crappie and a 30 fish limit per person, is more than enough for a good feed. The 300 number for sunfish is due to the fact that most anglers fishing for sunfish are from the US. Surveys indicated that the average US angler travelling here was taking home just over 200 sunfish for a weeks fishing so this number will allow those anglers to still enjoy their week of fishing. The 7 inch size limit was chosen to protect the large sunfish in the population which keep the smaller male sunfish from spawning. Once a sunfish begins to spawn they devote most of their energy to reproduction and almost none to growth. If the smaller males begin to become successful spawners, thus maturing earlier, because of a lack of large males, the population can become stunted which is very hard to reverse. So when you look at the fact that you are only allowed 30 over 7 inches it resembles the crappie limit. Also for those that don't really want to worry about a size limit (like kids) 30 is a fair number of sunfish. Crappies and sunfish are both not native to these lakes but they are established now. The year-round pike fishery is to try to limit the spread of this fish in the Kawartha's. They are very hard on the Musky and walleye stock and are being treated as invasive. They still fight really hard. These lakes are not really great perch lakes but we still have a good population. Looking for monster perch, Simcoe is probably better but we will catch our share. The size at spawning is not as important with perch as it is with sunfish.  As far as the contradiction by opening panfish but putting a limit in place. Currently we have no limits on panfish but a closed season for five months of the year. That is a true contradiction.  The limits are fair and liberal enough so everyone can enjoy the fishery without abusing it or damaging it.  I hope that answers most of the questions mentioned.  Trust me, after sitting through 3 years of almost monthly meetings for the fishery advisory council. Ron, myself and the other coucil  members have become some strange collection of panfish experts."
