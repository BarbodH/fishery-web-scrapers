405314,Mike the Pike,2009-11-25 02:42:00,3421,Mohawkbay trailer park.  Pikeral Park in Hay Bay.  You will find more campsites from this link  Campsites in the Bay of Quinte  MTP
405404,nitewatcher769,2009-11-25 15:12:00,7,"i think i am asking the wrong style of question.. what i am looking for is a campground site that does not have electricy for example if you know nine mile river at port albert, there are 2 camp grounds. one that has everything and also is more pricey and then there is the other camp ground, that has nothing in it.. but just the true way of camping besides a tent.. the reason why i am looking for something like this is, in the winter i can still go camping and ice fishing... now these unservicable sites are usally alot cheaper.. i know of 3 camp grounds .. thank you for the answers so far, thanks steve"
405405,nitewatcher769,2009-11-25 15:14:00,7,"thanks Mike for the reply and i checked those both out already, mohawk bay is also a good one to think about.. again thanks for your help steve"
405406,bigbuck,2009-11-25 15:17:00,2449,"You can probably rule out Honey Harbour. The township is trying to close down the remaining campgrounds and is giving the owners a lot of static. Besides, I know our place only has serviced sites and we're full (only 10 trailer sites)."
405408,nitewatcher769,2009-11-25 15:26:00,7,"thanks bigbuck .. thats too bad about the Township, i have fished there a few times and it would have been great to find a site up around that area.. for you get every type of fish possible. the only 2 spots i stayed at were Halls cottages and Brandi's island.. again thanks for your help steve"
