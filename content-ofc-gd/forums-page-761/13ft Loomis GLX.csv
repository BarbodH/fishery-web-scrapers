404705,Guest steel'n'esox,2009-11-22 19:16:00,0,"Anyone know where I can find a replacement tip for the above rod model 1562 GLX 2-S 13ft 6to10lbs, ive tried to order through Loomis USA, and was told to try the warranty centre in Canada, but had no luck their as well, as the rep said I could not purchase just the tip section, any info would be appreciated"
404818,Spiel,2009-11-23 03:18:00,9065,Is this a custom built rod or a factory rod?
404837,canadadude,2009-11-23 10:52:00,769,dude drop the $75.00 and get a brand new rod
404843,solopaddler,2009-11-23 11:13:00,8605,It's pretty simple. Package the broken rod up and send it to Shimano in Peterborough. They'll either replace the broken section or possibly the entire rod.
404892,BrownTown,2009-11-23 15:46:00,103,How much of the tip did you break off if any? if the top guide is only damaged. Go to the recoil website and get a tip for cheap..better then forking out 75 bucks and waiting 3 months for your rod. ( well maybe 3 for the IMX warranty to GLX)..

404894,DRIFTER_016,2009-11-23 15:53:00,10439,"The OP doesn't say that his tip is broken, only that he want's a replacement tip. Maybe his rod is fine and he just wants a spare in case. Possibly the OP can clear this up. If it is infact broken, just send in the rod for warranty replacement as Solopaddler says."
404908,solopaddler,2009-11-23 16:26:00,8605,"Should also add, it's necessary to send in the entire rod as a new tip would need to be properly fitted. They're not all 100% the same..."
404931,Guest steel'n'esox,2009-11-23 18:17:00,0,"Thanx for the replys, the tip section broke at the first guide from the tip, about 6 inches, its a factory rod, not a custom. Tried the warranty centre in Peterborough, but they could not locate one, I gave them the guys name in California as well but came back with the same results as well, the warranty program in the states is a different setup than the one in Canada, come back Lorne Green"

405150,solopaddler,2009-11-24 14:52:00,8605," Not sure I'm following you here. You mail or drop off the broken rod to Shimano in Peterborough, and they'll replace it, end of story."
405155,lew,2009-11-24 15:06:00,12766,"I've dealt with the Peterboro office a few times and they've always gone way overboard to accomodate me and rectify the problem. I broke a rod  once, 100% my carelessness, and they replaced it without question, and a couple times they've repaired reels for me without charge.  If they can't find a replacement tip,I'm also surprised they didn't just offer a new rod, even with a small replacement cost."
405347,Bondar,2009-11-25 04:56:00,817,"Yea they have been good to me as well , i bought a 10'6 loomis and i didnt like the epoxy work on it looks like they stopped spinning it before it dried so i called , the warrenty center , they sent Canpar to my house picked up the rod for free sent me a brand new one to my door no charge and all in 2 weeks i was very impressed"
405355,canadadude,2009-11-25 06:48:00,769,"I broke a loomis last year $75.00 expiditer warranty, shipped them the rod 4 weeks later I was drifting my 10.5 loomis brand new, the warranty is the same in the US or canada however in the US some retailers will replace your rod on the spot."
405356,canadadude,2009-11-25 06:57:00,769,"nice rod, 10'6 float series is the best bottom bouncer ever made, except maybe the 11'4 although I still like the 10'6"
