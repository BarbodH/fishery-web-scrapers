404735,aniceguy,2009-11-22 20:43:00,1094,"I dont know how it happened or really should I care but the last 30 days have been surreal to say the least.  This fall has been one of the nicest weather wise in a long time and the stars aligned more then  once allowing me to fish 9 out of the last 23 or so days.  I have dragged tubes for Erie bass, fished Browns way more then I wanted chased   Chromers on a consistant manner, but today seems to be the icing on the cake.  But let me digress back a bit.  Not wanting to really fish any tournaments on Erie simply do to my 18.5 boat and having to run to the US in 8 footers put me in a "" fun fish Mode"" where it didnt matter when and where i fished,glad I did as I figured out some waypoints that once I get the SI unit I can go over to confirm whats there.  Eire  has been really bad for mooching spots   and Im happy I figured out some water on my own.  Last trip I took a friend Justin out he never experienced the bass on Erie but the 6 footers and a stomach flu had him off sooner then later.  We managed a few but nothing to write home on, sadly its more then likely my last trip on Erie until April..... A few from the day    a really nice fish from the day Im a big guy so it makes my fish look small lol    A few brown and steelhead trips in between and that brings me to today.  Figuring in a month or so we will be on ice a buddy and I decided one last soft water trip before winter ice fishing  and the Niagara was in order.  While we are at it we figured a shore lunch to cap it.  Where else can you go that's an hour from my house and virtually guarantee a shore lunch....Bingo Simcoe It really sunk home after I had fish and chips with a friend Friday how badly I wanted a fish fry again  so there was no way I wasnt doing shore lunch today  So off we go, this time though I brought my youngest as he has a love for fishing that I think I love catering to even more.  We arive to beautiful sheet glass water...BINGO perfect........ here he is enjoying a rest    We planned in advance so I par boiled potatoes then added bacon a pile of onions and seasoning perfect to flip a bit on the burner and eat....its a precurser to the attipiskat trip next summer, I think I ll be doing my share of shore lunch that week so some training is always welcome  the fishing wasn't fast or furious but some nice jumbo's were to be found thats for sure    I love fishing shallow for perch and watching them cruise then dropping a shiner on then and wham ohhhh in the well they go, catch and release is a great thing but sometimes we all need to embrace our canadian love for fish striaght out of the lake    needless to say it was a picture pefect day until my son buried a #10 hook into my eye lid, happily when I told him not to move he didnt so the barb didnt go in and was able to work it out and back to fishing we went it could have gone the other way real fast so I was happy he listened  Anyhow we fished fast and furious until  the telltale sign of lunch approached yup the grumbling tummy symdrome...with that off we went, it was great seeing my son pick them off in the livewell      After we got out of the water I noticed something odd, for a faint second I thought hummmm beans fresh fish pan fried potatoes and fresh Mushrooms....then I re thought they were oddly hanging off the engine of my friends boat, strange seeing a mushroom adhere to metal of an engine and god only know what sort of mushroom it was......any help is appreciated on it      Im glad my son came it made the day one of my most memorable of the entire years fishing and his smile at the end of the day coupled with his full tummy of fresh fish was well worth it and beyond    Its time to kick back have a few beers watch some football and get ready for work,  I have a friend driving to Florida for a few so Im hoping I can reschedule a few things and fish some shiners under a balloon next week......heres to hoping"
404738,Roy,2009-11-22 21:08:00,13728,Found them on the motor did you? In French we call dem de honda moteur mushrooms.
404741,irishfield,2009-11-22 21:12:00,26272, lol and there's nothing magic about them !  Looked like some good time spent on the water Louis !
404851,aniceguy,2009-11-23 13:02:00,1094,lol no doubt they are magical at all ..........
404872,BillM,2009-11-23 14:55:00,17367,You should have ate one and found out!  
404876,crappieperchhunter,2009-11-23 15:06:00,2582,Loved the fish fry...but now I'm hungry   Whenever I have a Simcoe perch fry with my brother and dad it always includes homefries and baked beans. Have you tried the maple flavored? I think they are the best with a fish fry.
404882,limeyangler,2009-11-23 15:32:00,5204,"good stuff ancieguy, i know its cliche to say this...but the kid's smile says it all!  weirdest location for a mushroom....lol"
404987,aniceguy,2009-11-23 22:14:00,1094,maple flavoreed beans rock unless your around me 5 hours later.....wierdest place for a mushroom too....it was a good chuckle
404990,BillM,2009-11-23 22:23:00,17367,/crosses off maple syrup beans from Attawapiskat trip.
405006,justin elia,2009-11-23 22:57:00,151,"Im going to try and get a little garden growing off the back of my boat.  The mushroom stays until it falls off on its own.  Lou, you look good in my Lund, time to trade in that lame bass boat for a real one.  Bill, we plan to do a little fish fry on Simcoe for perch again when the ice forms, you're more than welcome to come out."
405011,aniceguy,2009-11-23 23:12:00,1094,"  Maybe we can add some roma tomatoes, for a sauce.....trade my boat for a lund so I can go what a whopping 30 miles and hour boat lol...   Bill I second that big time it was pretty much at the top of the list for favorite trips of the year  Dont worry about the Pike trip the bean attack is late in the night and I suspect we will be a weeee bit tipsy then and wont care if I sprout some blue angels around then"
405018,BillM,2009-11-23 23:57:00,17367," Sounds like a plan!!  Although I'm allergic to fish   But I'll catch as many as I can for you guys to eat...  Louis, I'll be bringing lots of Gibsons Finest Rare and other bottles of goodies."
405019,aniceguy,2009-11-23 23:59:00,1094,gibsons you say..........ohh ya I think this trip is stacking up for a big time bucket list event
405022,justin elia,2009-11-24 00:16:00,151," What difference how fast you go if you cant catch bass?  BTW, my ride does 55."
405056,aniceguy,2009-11-24 01:35:00,1094,  see exactly
