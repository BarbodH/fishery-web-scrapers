404599,limeyangler,2009-11-22 02:20:00,5204,"Hi All,  GOT MY FIRST MUSKY TODAY!!!   The weather here is nuts for this time of year, I was ice fishing in front of the house on the 22nd November last year....lol...not this year......here is a picture taken from the yard on 21st November last year........      And here's the scene as we set sail from my house this afternoon..........      Anyway.....i have a load of pics to update my Iceman Cometh thread to show the lack of progress we are making this year as far as ice goes...but back to my first musky.  We started trolling in front of the house and followed the shoreline round to the next bay over, we both knew that there is an extended rocky point that faces the main lake basin and thought we'd troll past it. We get just in front of where the point comes up and i think I’m snagged...for about 2 seconds...then the snag head shakes a couple of times ....and there she is...MY FIRST EVER MUSKY!!!!!!   We got her unhooked...took piccies , high fives all over the place and Lew suggests that since we have now drifted to back where we started while unhooking we try the same path again....who said lightning doesn't strike twice?  No sooner than we hit the same spot Lew is into one too!!!....we've only been fishing for 15 minutes and we get 2 musky in the boat!  I'm very grateful to Lew...I’ve only been out 3 times and i've got my 1ST.....even better its right on my doorstep!!!! Better go and buy some musky tackle as i'm using Lew's......lol   MY FIRST MUSKY 42""....LEW GOT ONE TOO 35""        MORE INCHES FOR TEAM #3     LEW'S FISH      We trolled around for another half hour but decided to run further down the lake to see if we could find the old trail that goes from Lake  Wabigoon into Mile lake. We had planned to do this earlier in the fall but never got round to it and thought our chance had passed some 2 weeks ago expecting the ice to be here, but since we had got 2 musky we thought we'd head over and see if we could find it . The reason we wanted to see if we could find it is because the 2 lakes are connected by a narrow twisting channel which is not safe for snowmobiles and planned to scoot across the trail instead in search of the crappie for ice fishing this year.....well we found it!......couple of trees down blocking the way...nothing that a chainsaw and 5 minutes won't cure.   OUR SEARCH FOR THE TRAIL WAS SUCCESSFUL TOO....ICEFISHING FOR CRAPPIE  REPORT ON THE WAY SOON!         We were gonna try to get some walleye and crappie in mile lake by taking the boat through the channel, but although the channel was clear from where the trail came out the lake was all but completely skimmed over with ice so we decided to troll for musky again, we hit a couple of bays, trolled along an ice ledge and finally hit the earlier spot again, with no luck.   TROLLING ALONG THE ICE EDGE WAS COOL....REMINDED ME OF THIS SPRING TROLLING FOR BROOKIES WITH OFC MEMBER BRKYGTR     We didn't get any more bites , but it was a really pleasant evening and we headed back as the sun started to set, really nice to be getting out at the house...i could not help thinking  what a lucky bugger I am to live on what is obviously a good musky fishery....lol....wonder if i can shore fish for them? To be continued.................lol.   REALLY PLEASANT EVENING.....EVEN BETTER BEING HOME WHEN YOU MOOR UP!  "

Not a sniff, not a rip, NUFFIN! 'Twas a wonderful day however, the company was great and the weather was too good. I was SURE I'd find a decent ski for the team but, it was not to be. Thank you for posting/sharing your success with us all. It's also really nice to hear the excitement and enthusiasm in your voice."
