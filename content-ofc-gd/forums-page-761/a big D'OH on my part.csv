A nice big slam off the Wally diver and it's still a bit away so I'm not sure what I have on the end.  A few big head shakes and I'm still not sure.  An ""older"" fellow is there seeing what's going on and comes over.  After a few min. fight I see the biggest small mouth I have ever seen!  I win the fight and get it landed and think to myself, zone 17 bass is closed get it back before someone asks to keep it or I get in trouble for OOS fish""  So I unhook this monster using the boka grip (as some my know I messed up my hand recently) and have a quick look at it (5.5LB on my BAD scale) and toss the fish back in.  The older fellow looks to me and says ""that was a keeper why did you toss it back?""...  I said bass is OOS here now so I had to no matter what and that's why I took care of the fish so quickly and didn't take any pic's so I wouldn't have issues"". So I get home and check my reg's for zone 20 to find out I could have taken more time with the fish and got a few pic's as it's not OOS yet!   ARRGGHH!!!!  And when I said ""bad"" scale, my boka type scale is very light to the fish's weight on a good scale.  I had a 5LB walleye on this scale that read just under 4 LBs but when on 2 other digital scales was in the high 6 range... I'm not mad that I let the fish go at all, just mad with myself for catching my largest bass of my life yet with nothing to show for it other than fish smell..."

404817,StoneFly,2009-11-23 03:10:00,574,"Yo man,..dont worry about it,..its in your head right!!!  some of the best trophies I have caught and landed have no pics....Stuff happens,...But Im curious why the old man would say a Big SMB over 5lbs was a keeper?  like to eat?"
404820,Sinker,2009-11-23 03:28:00,8692,"No pics, no fish  Just kidding........too bad ya didnt get a shot of it, but you still caught it!  S."
404856,GBW,2009-11-23 13:31:00,8460,"thanks guys and yes I will not forget it. StoneFly, I guess he would have eaten it if he caught it...  maybe he ment keeper to get a mount made?  I duno... either way, it was a heck of a way to break in my new rod and reel... *note to self* get back out to that spot ASAP with OFC team sign a camera..."
