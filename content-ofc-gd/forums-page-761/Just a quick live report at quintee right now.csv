404834,bigredfisher,2009-11-23 07:15:00,300,Hey I am here at quinte. The conditions aren't good. East wind st like 4pm km hr. It seems like it's around 10 k an hour. Fishing is pretty slow. I managed my pb tonight though. It must be shy of 14lbs. I am the only one who caught anything and there is like 10 guys here. I also missed one other bur I was too slow on the hookset. Hope you enjoy my report live from quinte
