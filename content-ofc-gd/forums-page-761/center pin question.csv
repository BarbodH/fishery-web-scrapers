403345,spinnerdoc,2009-11-18 04:44:00,556,"been looking around and can't quite decide yet...budget is always a deciding factor.looked at the islander, ravens and saw the angling spec. , i am gearing towards the ross flow reel...any thoughts on that reel...would appreciate it... till i make up my mind...i'm sticking with my abu legend...working good so far  tight lines"
403356,tributaryhunter,2009-11-18 05:22:00,108,"begginer wise a raven will do the trick for ya, until you decide to switch it up eventually"
403416,[email protected],2009-11-18 13:42:00,290,I will have a GLoomis as of tonight
403419,silvio,2009-11-18 13:48:00,433,ross flow is trash... ang specs will run you some good $$$$ but it will be a one time buy you cant get much better.
403426,MJL,2009-11-18 14:16:00,2427,"I’ve only fished with 1 guy who had the Ross Flow – Haven’t used one or played with one myself…Quirky reel design, you can pop the spool off and switch the handles to the other side if you ever decide to retrieve with the other hand – No need to respool the other way (great if you get tired and are ambidextrous  ).  I own a few Ross fly reels and they’re quality pieces for the price (Cimarron and CLA) – Not sure how their float reel would compare.  If it were me, I’d go with either an Islander or a Raven SST if you can afford something in the mid priced range. In the end (in most cases), you won’t be spending more by buying a more expensive but quality reel that will last and perform to your needs.  I’m more partial to Islanders mainly because I’ve had one for ages, abused it and it’s never let me down."
403458,Jet,2009-11-18 15:35:00,364,"For the price of the Ross, the Islander is a much better choice and a proven performer. Just google ""Ross Flow Centerpin"" go through  the results and you can find a lot of reviews."
403513,rock34,2009-11-18 18:00:00,215,I love my islander and have never had a problem with it.....very durable.
403515,tonyb,2009-11-18 18:09:00,1637,"Was looking at the Islander as well, I don't think you'll find many negative reviews of the IS...  I currently use an Okuma Aventa...and it's not as refined of a reel as I'd like (ok it's the crumbiest cheap reel out there lol) but the price was right and it works!  Just remember, the reel is just a tool, it's your noggin that will lead to catching fish  Tony"
403555,spinnerdoc,2009-11-18 20:29:00,556,"i agree that the reel is just a tool. with these i'll be able to make my decision.i liked the raven sst, feels nice and smooth. i'll see in a few weeks...bearing-wise...which do you guys think have better...the islander feels nicely as well...are parts easy to order or they have to be special ordered?   hey rain coming on thursday....."
403557,[email protected],2009-11-18 20:40:00,290,"Gear is Gear... but with crappy gear, it decreases your chances at landing a fish greatly.  Thats why I am biting the bullet and getting a nice float setup."
403563,justin elia,2009-11-18 21:10:00,151," Both the Islander and all Raven models are good reels.  Both companies have great customer service, I doubt you will have a problem with any model you buy or accessing parts.  I have personally used both the Raven Classic/SST 2 and Islander IS and dont have any complaints.  Welcome to the wonderful world of centerpinning, you won't go back.  Good luck.  J"
403586,bare foot wader,2009-11-18 22:41:00,1354,"if you have your budget in mind just buy a used reel in good condition and swap in new bearings....a centre pin reel itself is pretty simple by design, they're all pretty much the same....but it's the bearings that affect the performance you experience on the water....pretty much the more you pay the tigther tolerances you get  my 4 yr old aventa with upgraded bearings outspun every islander I played with yesterday....  I'd recommend looking for an okuma...aventa or sheffield....relatively cheap brand new and lots of used ones everywhere, good quality and look good enough too....a little on the light side to balance the long sticks or heavier rods but there are ways around that too"
403587,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-11-18 22:41:00,0,"i'm fairly new to centerpins as well but as with spinning combo's i found the rod to be more important than the reel.  i too use an okuma reel at the moment, and there is nothing wrong with it whatsoever.  the okuma rods were garbage though, and within months of getting my first combo i was upgrading.  i own a quantum coldwater and a raven now and i'm much happier."
403622,solopaddler,2009-11-19 01:10:00,8605,"Don't buy the Ross Flow, you'll regret it."
403629,StoneFly,2009-11-19 01:24:00,574," Dooooood, arent you supposed to be learning how to catch the fish with a spinner before you get a pin?  you should seriously consider it for a season,...the pin is just going to confound your learning curve."
403637,jdmls,2009-11-19 01:36:00,575,ross flow =    
404216,spinnerdoc,2009-11-20 18:19:00,556,"had a closer look at the ross flow and i will not be getting it, the bearing case is thin as hell. anyway, i'm still thinking getting one after christmas, and yes i am still learning to fish steelhead on both my spinning reel and baitcaster...between the 2 i like the baitcaster better.  i'd have to say 3 outings and 2 hooked and one landed gets your heart pounding...i'd say about 3 hrs each time. the view was amazing, i could why someone would be addicted to this"
404271,silvio,2009-11-20 21:36:00,433,"Get a pin and learn and by spring you'll be all over them. islander is great reel ravens are good to but don’t get one that’s to light because your going to have a hard time balancing your rod. best advice is... steelheading isn't as hard as your going to think it is, don't put it in your head that if your shots are not exact or your leader isn't 2 feet you wont catch fish. just fish with confidence and go up to someone with a pin who ""is catching fish"" and ask them if your set up is right that's all. don't lose sleep if you get skunked don't get frustrated you'll just dig a bigger hole.  when I first started I dug a hole big enough for me and 10 others my mistake I took it to serious and not enough confidence. I learned its not as hard as I was making it out to be and as soon as I simplified things I start to have great days on the water. Good luck"
404273,[email protected],2009-11-20 21:39:00,290," ^ good words.  Take a look at a bunch of us ""starting steelheaders"" this season and how we have been skunked time and time again. But we keep going back and staying at it.  Laz was the first one to break the ice and now I'm waiting on mine! lol.."
404959,spinnerdoc,2009-11-23 20:09:00,556,"nice to know that people haven't forgotten that they were once newbies like me. in terms of getting skunked i am not too cencerned about it as i go fish to relax and be with nature, so to speak. i've learned a long time ago not to go fishing expecting to catch anything, for me i'm always glad just to go fishing."
404970,[email protected],2009-11-23 21:00:00,290,"  Exactly  It's better to be in the middle of the river catching nothing, than sitting at home doing nothing."
