Caught three on saturday, one today. My friend who hasn't been out basically all fall caught three. It was a good day for him.  As for the question which is the real reason I'm making this post: There were a dozen fish in a pool, 3-4 in a rapid and one under a log. I've tossed everything I had at them. Roe bags big and small, Single egg, Pink worm, Wooly Bugger, Spinners, egg sucking leech and a pink steelhead jig. Nothing! Went down to my smallest float 2g and 4 pound line thinking it was because they were seeing it. Should I have walked away? I rotated over and over, tried different shotting patterns. None seemed interested. I was thinking they were already caught fish but they all couldn't have been!   Edit! pic of Sunday Fish  "

404795,timmeh,2009-11-23 01:40:00,609,"They were likely very spooked after a weekend of pressure. They weren't all caught previously but if one or two were it could throw all of them off. And if you're looking at them they most likely know you're there. When I encounter this  if I don't get one in 15 min or so I just move on. You could spend hours and not get anything. Usually with trout, the ones you see are not the ones you catch."
404797,Paully,2009-11-23 01:54:00,712, You hit the nail on the head with that one..
404814,StoneFly,2009-11-23 03:03:00,574," Absolutely,...I caught well over 100 steelhead before I ever got a glimpse of one before it hit....the waters I learned how to fish them were much bigger and darker than them eastern tribs,....its a much different approach....that being said,....you can use the Jedi Mind trick into gettin spooked fish to hit,...  but in the absence,..just try not to spook them or let them see you for that matter....if you have ever watched a video of someone creeping up to the side of the river on his hands and knees ever so slowly and hiding behind cover,..there is a reason,..its not just for fun."

404858,[emailÂ protected],2009-11-23 13:34:00,290,  I broke off 5 fish at the hook with that 4lb stuff that we got

405009,danjang,2009-11-23 23:10:00,148,"I'd go lower if it were a different river, this one is small with a lot of trees. Since I have no waders I would be screwed if one ran to far up or down. I'll prolly head somewhere else if this happens again. Maybe I'll even invest in camo clothing!"
