Got into 5 (actually 4, one was so hungry I caught him twice lol).....  A nice lady....   She liked the pink worm....   Then this gent....   And again, must have been hungry....   Caught these two rockets on the way out.... they were fresh and fought like crazy...    All in all, a good day out...  Burt"

405101,snag,2009-11-24 05:03:00,1932,"Nice man,  Is that a hair tie to hold your gear?"
405102,snag,2009-11-24 05:05:00,1932," sorry,  the purple circle looks like a hair tie.  I use one on some of my gear."
405448,jrego7,2009-11-25 17:53:00,37,Nice fish! I see you caught one on a pink worm. Haven't had any luck with those yet.
405449,bare foot wader,2009-11-25 17:59:00,1354,beauty fish....on a side note...love those purists but way too nice to be paired with a quantum stick....lol
405477,tonyb,2009-11-25 19:52:00,1637,Very nice! Good to see you still tying into some chromers bud
405556,Burtess,2009-11-26 00:46:00,901, It is a hair tie (I have not tried Wallacio's method of wrapping the line around the reel yet).... Burt
405558,Burtess,2009-11-26 00:49:00,901, I haven't until this year.  I had always had some sporatic luck with them but this fall they seem to like them more.   The way I beat my rod (pun intended   ) there is no way I am going to run a stick that goes for a few hundred bucks..... the Purist only cost me $100 shipped anyway....    I try my best lol....  Burt
