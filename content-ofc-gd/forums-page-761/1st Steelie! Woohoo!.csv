405004,[emailÂ protected],2009-11-23 22:45:00,290,Wow!  Very nice!
405025,I'mHooked,2009-11-24 00:26:00,525,"I was pretty stoked. Just the one day surpassed all of the trout of caught in my life so far!! Only been fishing a year. The larger Chromer weighed in at 7lbs and put on the most fight I've ever experienced! Keep saying to myself of the 6# flouro & #8 hook, ""Please don't break...please don't break!"" I kept the line tight and was getting a little nervous when he'd be at the surface then decide to start pulling drag and heading straight down under the boat!!  It was sweet victory getting the net under it!!  I'm ""definitely"" Hooked!"
405028,walleye_man,2009-11-24 00:42:00,135,wow great fish how big was the brown? my biggest is only around 17/18 inches from a small pond though congrats
405042,Twocoda,2009-11-24 01:03:00,4130,sweet deal man ...nice bullets and brown !
405046,I'mHooked,2009-11-24 01:10:00,525," Thanks. The Brown was around 20 inches. Didn't weigh him, though I'm estimating he's between 4-5 lbs."
