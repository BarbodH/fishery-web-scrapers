The wind was pretty strong from the SE and Thompsons Pt created a lee that was easier to fish, once you were out the lee, the winds blew you right along, the two drift socks kept us a decent drift.  With the higher speed, we went to heavier jigging lure, today the lure of choice was the 1.0-1.25 oz Rapala jigging lure or a knockoff of it. Later in the afternoon, when the winds died, I was able to drop my size to a smaller version and still managed to land fish.  We jigged til 1500 and trolled back to the launch ramp, this part of the days fishing yielded nothing. The day of jigging brought us a total of 26 eyes, one of which was 17"", the rest were small........  I think that our next trip will be to the deeper water and do some trolling for larger fish.  Thanks to BayBoy for the ride and the days fishing, always a lot of laughs.  Stay Tuned  David  aka  Superdad."
