My deepest Symphathies to Bernadette ,Steve and your family.  Here are some pix of Sonny doing what he loved alot fishing.             In this photo Percher,MTP,Bernadette,Fred and Sonny.      MTP"

404474,Jen,2009-11-21 15:25:00,833,"My family is going through one of the hardest things a family can face...  For me losing my brother leaves me at a loss for words... (if you know me you know that is saying a lot)  He was part of my everyday, the strength of a god in my eyes... A part of who I am and who I will always be... we shared so many moments, competed in everything we did...We just loved one another unconditionally...I just don't know what I will do without him...  Sonny grew up with three sisters... a hard job for any boy, yet together we were strong!  He will be missed in every moment...            Thank you so much for all your thoughts and prayers, I will ensure my family reads every one of them.  Steve and Sonny's friends will be arranging a benefit in his memory for his family... We will let you know when that will be happening.  He was 40 years old, had a wife Jennifer, son Domenic, and daughter Emma, all of whom he adored.  The funeral arrangements will be made today and all information will be posted here when we know it...  Again Thank you  Cheers Jen ( Bernadette)  When you get a chance today, tell someone close to you that you love them!"
