403284,Harrison,2009-11-18 01:06:00,2202," I have caught a ton of them over the years and come to think of it, I have never caught one under 3 lbs that I can recall.  Things that make you go hmm."
404201,mpt,2009-11-20 17:39:00,158,If it only has 1 barbel it's in the cod family.
404335,smally21,2009-11-21 00:08:00,993,ive only caught them thru the ice in temagami.  the first one i caught wrapped its slimey tail around my wrist and i SQUEALED LIKE A LITTLE GIRL!  only thru the ice and mostly at night.  where are they all summer?
404387,MCTFisher9120,2009-11-21 03:03:00,3761," I could get you pounds of Bowfin man if you like it. I catch them no smaller than 4lbs at the grandma's house...biggest at 6lb 11oz  Let me know, MTBF"
404726,johnnyb,2009-11-22 20:15:00,3413,LOL Mike....just give me directions to Gramma's house
404764,Dabluz,2009-11-22 23:23:00,701,"In the Saguenay River near my home in Chicoutimi, I catch lingcod all winter.  They are the saltwater variety.  They are very dark in colour.  Yes, they are related to cod.  As related as perch are to walleye.  Most of the lingcod I catch are in the 4 to 7 lb categorie.  They are excellent eating.  The cheek muscle is huge and is great eating too.  The deep water in the Saguenay River is salt water and during the winter I fish for cod, halibut, lingcod, ocean perch, flounder.  In the shallower water, I catch smelt and brook trout.  To catch lingcod, you bait has to be on bottom.  I like to use a 2 ounce jig baited with a smelt.  I bounce the jig on bottom to attract the lingcod.  The hooks further up the line are baited with smelt and I catch cod on those hooks.  I fish up to 500 feet in depth but there are much deeper places in the Saguenay."

402100,limeyangler,2009-11-14 02:54:00,5204,"I ate some a couple of seasons ago, best tasting fish around if ya ask me...and yes...they are absolutely related to cod...same genus or whatever the scientific word is.  I researched it after tasting it because it is EXACTLY LIKE COD...did it in a beer batter...awesome!  Two reasons i have not eaten more is because getting the skin off looked a bit of a chore (the guy i was with did a slit all round the head , grabbed some pliers and pulled...peeled it like a banana,  the other reason was that unless you get a fairly decent size one there was not much meat to be had off it, but that might just be his skinning abilities...but mine would be worse."
402173,jayess,2009-11-14 16:50:00,187,"As mentioned earlier, you cannot avoid catching them through the ice on temagami... once it gets dark, goodbye trout/whitefish and hello ling.  Not knowing how to fillet them, we'd just pack it in once dark hit because they'd be on our lines non-stop.  We caught some in the 3-5lb range mainly. Nothing monstrous.  Seen them in Algonquin Park as well."
402181,pike slayer,2009-11-14 17:56:00,1177,i only know of one lake up here in the sault that has them and was told back in the day some finlanders planted them in there. would the mnr know of other lakes with decent populations of ling?
402184,Kinger,2009-11-14 18:20:00,351," They are in the river, lots in the 4-7 lbs range."
402192,pike slayer,2009-11-14 19:04:00,1177,"good to know kinger! ive never tried to target them soft water fishing. you care to give me more info on targeting them in the river? if so shoot me an PM. the only lake i know with them is paquette on the ranger, you get tons but they are only 1-2lbs and ive only got them ice fishing."

402213,Greencoachdog,2009-11-14 22:50:00,8163,How to skin a Burbit eh!      Mmmmmmmmmmmm!!!... fresh Burbit!  The same exact way I skin and fillet a Catfish!!!    ... except I use these!  http://www.cabelas.com/cabelas/en/template...=0053579014941a  ... much better than regular pliers for skinning scaleless fish!!!
402659,fishermccann,2009-11-16 14:50:00,655,"Thanks  folks thats a lot more info than I had before about Ling, and that was a great picture of one , Thanks."
402761,jimmer,2009-11-16 19:12:00,2730,This is one out of Nipissing.  It tasted okay.
402801,Jonny,2009-11-16 21:04:00,1380," Nice mottled colour. Seems to me I usually see them darker than that.  ---  Interesting recipe in that one Youtube clip. Boil for 7 minutes, then sauté in butter. Will have to try that some time!  Poor man's lobster?"
402957,Sinker,2009-11-17 01:51:00,8692,"I caught this one on May 21, 2009 jigging for whities on simcoe. 80FOW on a badboy type jig. First and only one I've ever caught out of there, but I've seen many caught, and even more on camera out of there. Most of the haliburton trout lakes are loaded with them too. Just set a jighead with salties on bottom at dusk and your pretty much guaranteed to get a couple. I prefer them over lakers on the table.      S."
403101,fishermccann,2009-11-17 15:11:00,655,That's a nice feed you have got there. Gotta love Simcoe!
403104,anders,2009-11-17 15:18:00,1168,Yup   poor mans Lobster...too bad i dont like lobster
403137,cuzza,2009-11-17 17:52:00,467," I was wondering the same thing, they look similar in shape, fin pattern etc. never thought they'd be able to survive in fresh water though - found this pic of a small ""sea ling"" for comparison, the British record for them is 59lb!!!  "
403154,bubbles,2009-11-17 18:37:00,591,"How is the population in Nippissing, I go up ice fishing every year and would love to target them.  Any tips specific to Nip?  I typically fish the south shore."
403161,sandmann,2009-11-17 18:59:00,51,Is a Ling the same as a Dog fish?  I caught a Dog fish in Simcoe and was told to kill it b/c it was an invasive species.
403162,pikeie,2009-11-17 19:30:00,380," lol invasive??? haha no the ""Dogfish"" which is acctually called Bowfin, is not an invasive species... native to ontario... dont kill them for no reason"
403163,Raf,2009-11-17 19:39:00,3495,  bowfin = don't eat    ling = eat

403168,anders,2009-11-17 19:49:00,1168,wrong....just plain wrong
403192,Jonny,2009-11-17 21:39:00,1380,Try that with a bowfin.  Talk about paying for misidentification.
403195,johnnyb,2009-11-17 21:44:00,3413,"Can't see the ""ling fling"" from where I sit at work...but I WILL say that I ate a bowfin last year....DEEEEE-licious!! I was afraid to eat it, but will tell you, I'll keep the next one I catch...the meat was almost like pork.  Really!"
403202,Jonny,2009-11-17 21:56:00,1380, I had the same qualms about drum before I tried it. But next spring I'll definitely cook up any I catch in the 3 to 4 lb range (never seem to get any smaller than that for some reason). I plan to try smoking them too.
401963,fishermccann,2009-11-13 16:02:00,655,"Does anyone know where close to the city that I can catch Ling. I hear  there is some in Simcoe,  but where would I have the best luck for them? I know that most ice fishermen don't  target Ling , but I hear they taste good and I would like to give them a try, any ideas folks? Thanks."
401965,MCTFisher9120,2009-11-13 16:09:00,3761,"My buddy caught a 12"" Ling in the Scugog River the other night while Walleye fishing...Not sure if they are abundant but there are some around."
401968,jimmer,2009-11-13 16:36:00,2730,"They are generally in the deeper cooler lakes.  However, some in the kawarthas, but tough to target.  Mostly incidental catches.  Simcoe is a big lake and again tough to target.  Some of the lakes in Haliburton County might be a better bet and night time would be the time to target them."
401972,hookerdown,2009-11-13 17:22:00,110,Yea there are definately ling in Simcoe.  I caught a bruiser ice fishing this winter.  i'll try to upload the pics.
401973,hookerdown,2009-11-13 17:26:00,110,More pics 
401975,johnnyb,2009-11-13 17:35:00,3413,"Ling a ding ding!!!! That's a nice one!!  Ling should be most active around mid-late feb. and early march, if I remember what I've read correctly.  They actually spawn under the ice, in shallow, at night.  Most people I've talked to that target them catch them at night, and use glow baits.  If you hit up youtube, there's all kinds of crazy aqua-vu videos of them.  I too want to go after them this year, as I've heard they're supposed to be delicious"
401983,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-11-13 18:04:00,0,i often catch them fishing for lakers with live bait.
401984,MCTFisher9120,2009-11-13 18:05:00,3761, Is that the record breaker/did you find out?
401985,Kinger,2009-11-13 18:06:00,351,I have sucessfully targetted them in the river. Smelt on or near bottom.
401986,NAW,2009-11-13 18:08:00,4022,"I hear there's a few up on Lake of Bays.  I also herd they have some sort of ""Ling festival"" up there for the locals or something..  I can't confirm that though.  I have personally never caught one, or seen one caught for that mater.  Good luck, and definitly post some pics if you catch one.  They're a cool lookin fish."
401991,ScugogBoy,2009-11-13 18:33:00,36,"I use to catch them through the ice up in Collingwood off the Pretty River in Feb-March in about 10 feet of water jigging a little cleo for rainbow trout/splake.....they would slowly come over to the lure and hit it with a fast spin of the head.....they were a fun fight as they rolled around the line.....once on the ice, they would stink to high heaven and we would toss them back down the hole.....wish we had kept some as people say they are fantastic to eat...""freshwater cod"" was the term used....Good Luck."
401994,basskicker09,2009-11-13 19:00:00,144,ya i would deffanitly like to catch one myself i love eating fish and i have some recipes that sound really good
401995,Abraxus,2009-11-13 19:02:00,104,Thats the biggest ling I have ever seen!  Whoah!  Ab
401996,hookerdown,2009-11-13 19:07:00,110,"No I didn't manage to find out anything about the getting it recongized, execpt the fish was ineligible cause I didn't document a witnesses and the girth.  Got some estimates on the weight being 12-18 lbs.  Its back in the lake, so maybe I'll get another chance meeting with it."
401999,Jds63,2009-11-13 19:16:00,1365,"That is definitely a big Ling, I have caught quite a few on Temagami , but thats the biggest I have seen  I'd like to see Dave Mercer kiss one of these .... my buddy caught this one last winter at around 1 am:  "
402007,Fang,2009-11-13 20:09:00,1330,"We'd catch dozens each night ice fishing on temagami. My wife hand lined up 2- 10 lbers, hooked both at the same time on a 2 way spreader with a salted minnow.  Any of the hut operators on Temagmi can tell you there's no end to them when fishing at night. The scour the bottom in areas where the ice huts are as daytime chumming will attract them. I've caught 10's and seen a 14lb er on temagami but most are 3-4 lbs.  One of the nicest fish I've ever eaten. side by side just as good as walleye or perch. Great bear bait too!"
402010,Jonny,2009-11-13 20:34:00,1380,Man! And people turn up their noses at freshwater drum.
402012,Woodsman,2009-11-13 20:36:00,1286,Although I never targeted them on Simcoe if I were to it would be mid Feb. to mid Mar. just after dark. I would target a shoal area like Long Shoal or Cooks Bay Shoal. About 20 fow water near deeper water would be a starting point. Jig a glow in the dark spoon with a bottom live bait rig near by. Pre-baiting also helps. This system has worked for me on other lakes such as Cassels & Bark. Another hint is if you have a partner near you have him pull in any nearby lines as ling will circle tangling all lines in range. If your by yourself keep your second line about 2/3rds the distance of the depth of water apart.  Rick
402014,Dutchy,2009-11-13 20:40:00,416,Dumb question here. Are these Ling related to the ones you find in the Atlantic Ocean? We used to catch Ling off the coast of Scotland.   Just curious.
402019,Flappn,2009-11-13 21:13:00,245,I've said it once and I will say it again......Ling are one ugly fish.
402033,Jonny,2009-11-13 22:54:00,1380," One of the names for ling is freshwater cod. This is mentioned in ""Freshwater Fishes of Canada"" (Scott & Crossman) but there is no mention of a direct relationship between the two.  Ling liver oil is as good as cod liver oil. Burbot livers were canned experimentally in Canada and were found to be of high quality for things such as canapés.  Adult ling over 20"" are voracious predators of other fish such as walleye, perch, drum, smelts and white bass.  According to the research for the book, the largest ling caught in Lake Simcoe was a 13 yr old female that was 33"" long and weighed 9.5 lb.  They have been caught in depths up to 700 feet!  ---  The ling we catch in Nipissing and Penage are a uniform dark brown."
402037,Musky or Specks,2009-11-13 23:19:00,2710,Ling are very tasty. Back when we had real winters we use to catch quite a few while fishing whitefish on Colpoys bay. None ever went to waste.
402040,siwash,2009-11-13 23:28:00,683,"  33"" is the record out of Simcoe???? dude, take a look at the pic of the Simcoe ling by one of our members... its more like 43""... maybe 45"""
402056,Jonny,2009-11-14 00:26:00,1380," Yes, I know. I was simply relating what the book said."
402096,fishinguypat,2009-11-14 02:40:00,547,nice ling cod...tehe
