387092,splashhopper,2009-09-25 22:08:00,2931,I like this site and find it to be pretty accurate.... the only thing it doesn't tell us is the water conditions.  http://scitech.pyr.ec.gc.ca/waterweb/formnav.asp    Maybe this could be put up as a sticky for the fall salmon and trout runs ?
387125,Twocoda,2009-09-25 23:58:00,4130,thats cool so far this year we are about average ....i wish it gave the times for the max and min though ...interesting find
387130,lllmojo,2009-09-26 00:09:00,13,thanks for share!
387282,BillM,2009-09-26 16:37:00,17367,Next will come the 'what flow rates are fishable for the (insert river name here)' questions
387388,splashhopper,2009-09-27 01:10:00,2931,  no idea what u mean by that... but rest assured.... having an advantage of knowing the depth of a favorite river BEFORE I drive 90-120 minutes to get to it is great info to have.  I can confirm the low water levels of the Maitland and the Bayfield rivers right now to be accurate to that link posted above... I drove right over them on my way to an in land lake that i fished with my daughter today...  Time and gas are not things I like to waste when I could be fishing
387408,SRT8 smoker craft,2009-09-27 02:26:00,1107,Although it is usually accurate it can be wrong I have been using the flow charts for several years and have been burned a few times. I left home pumped to slam some maitland chromers and got there to see the river just about at flood stage and looked like a double double was a total waste.
387425,BillM,2009-09-27 03:38:00,17367,"  What I meant is you'll still need to do the legwork to go fish the rivers then compare the flow to the actual flow data.  ie, you'll figure out what flow numbers work for what river..."
387484,StoneFly,2009-09-27 14:10:00,574,"For Some reason,...there is never any up to date  data for certain East Tribs or sometimes no data at all.  One particular river that I love to fish hasnt had any data for over a year.  Its kindof a piss off..."
387495,BillM,2009-09-27 15:19:00,17367, Those ditches can't be to hard to figure out
387498,StoneFly,2009-09-27 15:40:00,574," Lol, true enough,...However 'those ditches' can be blown one day and great the next or not,..depending on the 'ditch', I like to optimize my time fishing, and those graphs do help alot, especially if you have no way of knowing how much rain a particular area got.!!!"
387499,BillM,2009-09-27 15:47:00,17367,"  I was only busting your balls   It's a great resource to have, that's for sure."
387536,splashhopper,2009-09-27 19:35:00,2931,"  yep... i do know the flow numbers for both those rivers because i do the leg work  when i see the low numbers on that link, I make plans to fish elsewhere and ""save the legs""..."
405392,splashhopper,2009-11-25 14:34:00,2931,Bump......
405424,DRIFTER_016,2009-11-25 16:38:00,10439,  Hey Bill What flow rate is best for the Don?? ?? I don't want to waste any time so want to know what flow rate is the perfect rainbow green?? ??  Been using that site and this one and for many years.
405533,StoneFly,2009-11-25 23:26:00,574,"Why did this come back after 2 months?  All Rivers will be blown all weekend, so noone should go fishing !!!"
