This thing is awesome and It has been living on the back of my boat for the last three weeks. It has been a challenge hiding it everytime I have been on the water. It's the only one in Canada but we can show the world now. Check out this video Yamaha put together of the first time I got to drive it  http://www.youtube.com/user/YamahaCanada#p/a/u/1/zFCljQsAu40  Dave Mercer"
