404926,MJL,2009-11-23 18:13:00,2427,"Looks like you're out of luck fishing the Kawarthas anytime soon unless you plan to ice fish for them in the new year.  Kawarthas are closed to fishing for all species at the moment.  Regulations for FMZ-17 ""Closed to angling for all fish species (including bait-fish) from Jan.1 – Fri. before 4th Sat. in Apr. & Nov. 16 – Dec. 31, except where noted as an exception""  New regs are supposed to be in place in the new year.  Might wanna give ice fishing for carp a try if you're really desperate.  You can try giving a harbour or rivermouth around Lake O a try if it's close by...Might be a little crowded with the steelhead guys though.  I usually find once the salmon enter the rivers in the fall, they push out the carp from normal holding spots and drive them out into the lake.  Good luck in your quest for gold."
