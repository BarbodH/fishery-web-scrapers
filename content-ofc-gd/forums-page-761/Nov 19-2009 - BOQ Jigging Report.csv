404086,superdad,2009-11-20 12:58:00,353,"Had a chance to get out with BayBoy and Laker John for another shot at the jig bite. Launched at Shermans and we had the lures in the water at 0945 and the first fish at 0947. It seemed as though they were still biting although not as strenuous as Monday past.  BayBoy had some lures that he wanted to try out and was very succesful with his Lil Foxies and Rapala jigging lures.  The rain held off until 1300 and when it came the bite just stopped, I was talking to Grant from G2 and they encountered the same thing, the bite shut down. They were also having trouble find some larger fish.  After an hour and a half of nothing,cept a pike bite that chomped the lure off my line, we began anew in 50' of water and I hooked a fish on my second jig, looks like the bite was back on after Bayboy and Laker John both reeled in fish. These bites were during a teeming downpour and by the way those really neat survial suits aren't waterproof!!!!!!!!!  We called it a day at 1615 and headed to the ramp. The total catch for the day was slightly less than our total on last Monday. All in all a very succesful day on Quinte.  We calculated that we have caught more walleyes in the last two day of jigging than we did all spring, summer and early fall. Lots of year classes, fishing should be good for some years.  Cheers to all  David  aka  Superdad"

404473,superdad,2009-11-21 15:22:00,353,"According to some the trolling bite has slowed and the jig bite is hot, we are able to get a few for the table.  We will be trying the trolling again probably next week.  Cheers  David  aka  Superdad"

404800,Mike the Pike,2009-11-23 02:00:00,3421,I have to learn how to jig Dave as I have never been good at it. Do you use minnows or just good old plastic grubs?  Good luck to you next week.
