404905,Jonny,2009-11-23 16:17:00,1380,I think tying a CO's salary to fines handed out is a bad idea.  And a bad idea is usually worse than just leaving something alone.
405215,Guest Johnny Bass,2009-11-24 20:20:00,0," See? Now this makes sense. Terry's article is misleading as it is speaking about first class constables. These are not new cops, these are veterans. The new cops make between 45-50K(according to both articles).  And you justify paying CO's 50-68k????For walking around in the bush and driving around on a lake? Drop the pay and hire more, and increase the fines and higher even more. Until the poachers are all caught. And the money goes back into conservation.  And to boot?You call a CO or the poachers line and they dont even show up!!!!  Sorry to all the CO's on here if you are offended. This is just MHO."
405216,Guest Johnny Bass,2009-11-24 20:31:00,0, Yes because the Conservatives haven't funneled billions of dollars to their friends in Alberta.  And aren't selling our infastruction to foreigners(just like the liberals did).Lets face it. All politicians are crooked.Its all a mater of which side of the trough you are feeding off.  As far as your closing argument? Yes. Hire more CO's and all that other stuff. Start enforcing the law and when people actually call the poaching number?To show up!
405225,tonyb,2009-11-24 21:12:00,1637," Thanks for stating that...I've always thought that a salary + commission model would work wonders for our natural resource protection.  Let the officers who are putting their lives on the line every day to protect fish and wildlife stocks get a chance to make some real bucks, and at the same time, be super motivated to stop illegal activities/write tickets.  I'd rather have a whole bunch of ticked off anglers waiting to fight tickets they believe are wrong, than a whole bunch of anglers knowing they won't even be stopped (and not adhering to regulations or buying licenses as a result)  Tony"
405236,BillM,2009-11-24 21:43:00,17367,Shouldn't the motivation come from actually caring about the fish and wildlife and not a big pay check?  Commission based salary for a CO is silly.  Imagine if the OPP was commission based?  No reason why a CO shouldn't be making what a cop makes (within reason)
405245,aniceguy,2009-11-24 22:14:00,1094,"thats like asking a police officer to confiscate as much crack as he can and get a bonus on it, I would never ask someone to put thier life on the line and conservation officers are in many ways more at risk to get shot then police officers, dont ask them to self fund based on volume ask the policy and law makers to make the fines condusive to the crime.  The province has money as does the MNR dont be fooled that they dont have it or cant gain access to it from the cabinet board, if the managers in Peterboro had the balls to run it right, things would be better but sadly they dont have the desire courage or nuts to make the tough decisions to do the right  thing to protect our natural resources, ask 90% of the biologists that still care and thats exactly what you ll hear.  Ministers are here and gone in 4 yrs managers in the ivory tower are here for decades....its those very same managers that need to take the dress off and man up and do the right thing"
405246,Harrison,2009-11-24 22:16:00,2202," I agree 100%.  This should absolutely be a no ""incentive"" program for a CO.   Except for seasoned officers to get help with their huge work load.  I just thought if you hired more CO's, covered their pays/costs through a ""pot"" directly funded by enforcement, they may cover themselves and therefore create a higher CO compliment."
405247,aniceguy,2009-11-24 22:20:00,1094,"Harrision had Mcguinty lost and Tory won you would have had a lot of new Special purpose accounts created for more accountability and to directly funnel money into them for specific purpose, for example fines as a result of CO charges would go to a SPF that funds the CO's  Sadly he lost"
405249,Harrison,2009-11-24 22:22:00,2202," I'm an email away!  Alot of good is done, but the balance that is not, is shameful considering we have this amazing resource that without proper due dilligence could/is being taken advantage of."

405253,Harrison,2009-11-24 22:26:00,2202,"Please don't turn this into a political thread, it will just get zapped."
405254,Fishnwire,2009-11-24 22:26:00,983,"Whatever they're paying COs, they could pay them about half and there would still be no shortage of men and women wanting to enter that profession.  When I was in high school some friends and I looked into becoming COs and even with the right schooling you have about as good a chance of winning the lottery as you do of getting on as a full-time conservation officer in Ontario.  Do you know how many people want those jobs?  I'm not saying they don't work hard or have a tough job, but for those that pursue that carrer it is their ultimate dream vocation."
405255,Jer,2009-11-24 22:30:00,1426,"   You wouldn't consider that to be a major conflict of interest for the CO when it comes time to testify in court? Assuming he is only paid his ""commission"" on conviction.  Sounds more like bounty hunting than law enforcement."
405289,John Bacon,2009-11-25 00:47:00,3277," I would be worried about them charging me with an offence that I had not committed...  If their compensation was based on how many fines they issue or convictions they achieve they may be tempted to bend the truth a little... or maybe a lot.  I think that this is what people mean when they state that is would be a ""confilict of interest"".  I do recall reading about some Ontario police offices being convicted of planting drugs ... so it does happen.  More recently there have been allegations that police may have been taking kick backs from tow truck drivers with the new racing law; their hasn't been any proof to that one.  So don't say that it couldn't happen; it already has.  It will happen more often if cops or CO's got to keep a portion of the fines they issue."
405303,Guest Johnny Bass,2009-11-25 01:31:00,0, Exactly. Even on this board alone. People are willing to volunteer for FREE!!!
405313,aniceguy,2009-11-25 02:25:00,1094," sorry not the intent what so ever just telling it as I see it, now dont get me started on Aurora because I like a few of those managers in there lol"
405394,Guest Johnny Bass,2009-11-25 14:43:00,0, You'd rather anglers like yourself be dragged to court for bogus charges?
405410,tonyb,2009-11-25 15:27:00,1637, That would suck as I do not fish illegally  but it would mean that poachers would certainly be caught and fined.  A minor inconvenience for the piece of mind that poaching would be eliminated by these bounty hunters
404048,John Bacon,2009-11-20 03:28:00,3277,"If the case goes to court the cost of the trial will likely exceed the fines in most cases.  That is even before we take the cost of the CO into consideration.  I believe that CO's salaries are similar to that of OPP officers.  The papers sometimes report cases of police officers earning in excess of $100k with overtime.  And that is just salary.  When you add support staff to the office, benefits, etc., the $175k per does not seem too far out of line.  More CO's mean more bosses and admin staff who cost money but don't issue fines.  I don't think there is much of a chance of CO's covering their costs."
404050,aniceguy,2009-11-20 03:37:00,1094,"At the end of the day unless an up and coming CO wants to live in Mommys basement they need competative salaries, that will draw talented compasionate and motivated officers.  If you google how the Ontario Parks formula works Co's could do the same but it would mean writing tickets to compensate the salaries and that is a slippery slope too......as Quota's now come into the mix.  Ultimately risk assessment with a willing Minister might make a difference until then the pillage continues"
404067,AzuluSpookd,2009-11-20 05:25:00,348," You must be thinkin salaries in the late 1980's to early 1990's...You're WAY off in your numbers...most cops..with court pay, shift premium are making close to 90k....base salary is almost 80k...OPP's usually last to negotiate and are generally one of the highest paid....much better benefits....firefighters...well...they are way up there and I mean way up there....especially with their schedules, they can actually work another job if they choose to.  IMO....I think CO's should be paid just as much as those guys....they are trying to protect a resource and their enforcement numbers have steadily declined since 1992 whereas police forces have increased their numbers since that time. Doesnt make sense to me, but for less then 200 CO's in the entire province, they are doing what they can with what little they are given."
404073,pikehunter,2009-11-20 09:35:00,1659,"Argue all you want about salaries and wages. There is only one fact I know for sure and that is I am very highly underpaid! Wish I had become a cop 30 years ago when it was easy to do so, particularly easier too when your wife was the regional police chief's daughter's friend, boy was I ever dumb."
404078,lew,2009-11-20 11:34:00,12766, When I first went on the job way back in '68 we were making $100 a week.  Seemed like good $$$$ back then
404084,Michael_Brown,2009-11-20 12:56:00,411,I assume that the fines collected by the CO's do not go to the MNR. They would go to the municipality where the fine was issued. Do you think you are overpaid for the work you do? I sure most people if they knew would say you are overpaid and some would say your not paid enough....whatever you make.  I want to thank the CO's we have for the work that they do.
404090,Harrison,2009-11-20 13:15:00,2202," So do I Michael!  Some solid points and great opinions all!  I see where some think funding themselves with fines might be a slippery slope, but if you are not actively participating in illegal activities what would you be worried about."
404119,Fish4Eyes,2009-11-20 14:17:00,1022,"Engineers in the ministry make 80k, not CO's. CO's make 40-50k. If they move on to be supervisors/managers then more."
404148,Guest Johnny Bass,2009-11-20 15:12:00,0," That sounds about right to me. And I did google cop pay and OPP pay and firefighter pay before commenting. Even what terry posted states TOP PAY used to be 70K. Now top pay is 80K. I constantly hear about how cops are underpaid and I believe it. Thats why I supported the strike.  Your telling me a starting CO makes $32 an hour? What do they make after 10 years? $50? Definitely over paid. I'd rather remove conservation officers altogether then and hire more Cops and OPP officers, so they can do 2 jobs. Enforce conservation laws and catch speeders, criminals and such. They are more trained to deal with the situation anyways. May be perfect for retired cops......"
404155,basketclam,2009-11-20 15:30:00,115,"Regarding the question of fines and where does the money go to, the MNR maintains what's called a Special Purpose Account.  As I understand it, the majority of funds collected go toward conservation programs.  Straight from the FWCA, here's the section that addresses the account:  85.  (1) All amounts received by the Crown under this Act shall be held in a separate account in the Consolidated Revenue Fund, including all fines, fees and royalties paid under this Act and all proceeds from sales under this Act, including sales of things forfeited to the Crown under this Act.  (2) Money standing to the credit of the separate account is, for the purpose of the Financial Administration Act, money paid to Ontario for a special purpose.   (3) The Minister may direct that money be paid out of the separate account to the Minister or a person specified by the Minister if,  (a) the payment will be used for the conservation or management of wildlife or fish populations or the ecosystems of which those populations are a part;  ( the payment will be used for a matter related to the activities of people as they interact with or affect wildlife or fish populations, including any matter related to safety; or  © the payment will be used to refund all or part of a fee or royalty under subsection 83 (2)."
404170,irishfield,2009-11-20 16:12:00,26272," Overpaid in who's world Johnny...  That doesn't go far in todays society. Do you pay a mortgage/property taxes/hydro/phone and feed a family of four, or are you still living at home letting Mom do that?

404319,John Bacon,2009-11-20 23:40:00,3277,"  Being legally allowed to enforce the laws; and it being practicle for them to enforce the laws are two different things.  It is one thing for police to issue tickets for fishing without a licence; it is another thing altogether for them to have to know all of the game and fish laws on top of the traffic laws and other laws that they need to know for their day jobs.  Besides, if had 200+ OPP offices in the bush enforcing game and fish laws we would need to hire another 200+ cops to enforce traffic and criminal laws.  Where's the savings in that?"
404325,Jer,2009-11-20 23:46:00,1426,   ...and how long until those 200 cops are sucked out of the bush and onto the street. There's more money (and PR) in traffic enforcement.

No Bush, no risk,..ALOT of extra $$ for the Coifers etc.  CO's certainly dont do it,...they cant,..there are not nearly enough of them.  I would argue however that a dozen coppers could bring in more $$ from August-October than they would otherwise,..and public safety wouldnt be threatned one bit,...they could always leave to go to an emergency....it would just be a re-routing of the $$ grab from most radar traps."

Big deal, they carry a gun.  Oh and I talked to a cop and the average pay is aboot 60K but they make extra money for court appearences and security gigs. Which usually adds up to alot more than 40 hours a week.  And you guys think a CO should make more than a cop???  There is a lot of money to be made catching poachers, and once they clean it up, they can go back to regular duties.

But Toronto Mayor David Miller has warned that the cost to taxpayers will be the equivalent of a two per cent tax hike.  Terms of the deal were released Thursday after months of discussions involving an arbitrator.  The Police Services Board has endorsed the deal, but Miller said the financial terms will put ""significant pressure"" on the city.  ""The city of Toronto is a tough place to be a police officer. They deserve to be fairly paid,"" Miller told reporters at City Hall on Thursday morning.  ""It is, however, very significant costs for the city and the Police Services Board. By 2011 the police budget in Toronto will be $1 billion. This award itself will create a pressure in next year's budget equal to about a two per cent tax hike,"" he said.  If the contract is ratified by the end of 2010, a first class constable will earn $81,249 per year, which will be $238 more than a first class constable in the Peel Regional Police force.  A new Toronto police officer earns about $50,000 per year.   and the link  http://www.cbc.ca/canada/toronto/story/200...ce.html?ref=rss"

I also agree that we should have more CO's. About double the current # would be a start. It's not about recovering the money spent on enforcement, but having some sort of enforcement in place to protect our fish and wildlife.  ....and the rant starts !  I wonder how many more CO's (country wide) could be hired with the 'BILLIONS' spent on a faulty, useless gun registry ? Thank the Liberal party for, once again, wasting 'BILLIONS' of our tax dollars to buy votes. Did I mention the 'BILLIONS' wasted on a faulty gun registry while it has done nothing to reduce gun crimes. Don't forget the 'hundreds of millions' (that we know of) that the Liberal party laundered to friends and family. I guess that's O.K. because they consider it ""charitable contributions"" as well as helping out those in need ........of GREED !!!  Remember what the Liberal party has done to us next time you vote. Don't turn a blind eye, as many others have. I'm not a fan of politicians in general, but have a special hate brewing inside of me for the people who are responsible for the gun registry and theft of our money. There are many politicians who should be in prison right now, but use our weak legal system and it's loopholes to continue stealing from us. In my opinion, the colour red in political circles represents nothing good. Broken liberal promises don't make them worthy of the elected positions they hold. Yes, they lie to get elected, then steal our money before we figure out the mistake we made.  .....and the apology. Sorry for the rant.

403882,Harrison,2009-11-19 19:39:00,2202,"Seems alot of anglers/hunters believe there is a lack of CO's in Ontario.  I was just finishing up a salary cost planning project here at work and it got me thinking.  The cost for a CO, I am guessing, is say approx. $175,000 a year.  i.e. Salary, benefits, pension, equipment/gear/unform/truck, vacation/sick time cover off, staff support etc..  Wondering if a CO could ""support"" their own position through fines, confiscating property etc..  Just thinking more CO's = more revenue = more service  Just throwing this out there, would you assume a CO generates more then $175,000 annually through enforcement?"
403885,JohnF,2009-11-19 19:43:00,3494, I suspect that if our govt thought this was a cash cow they'd have created one CO for every fisherman and hunter by now.  JF

403899,aniceguy,2009-11-19 20:32:00,1094,"Here is Part of a policy brief that I wrote a while back I think it effictively dealt with the infection the OMNR has currently with its enforcement, while its dated by a fewyears  it was sound fiscally when I wrote this....Happy that the current Minister agreed and has been ramping up enforment as of late.  FYI a few weeks ago there were 40  CO trucks parked in Mississauga for delivery  CONSERVATION OFFICERS  Enforcement at present is grossly inadequate to protect our natural resources from poachers and unregulated industry.  We believe the self funding model used for Ontario Parks System for conservation enforcement is a realistic goal.  To achieve this a 200% increase in active Conservation Officers is needed within the first year of proposed improvement in the MNR.   Currently there are 199 conservation officers patrolling close to a 1 million square kilometers as opposed to 1992 when there were 257 uniformed officers.  Our proposal targets roughly 400 CO’s working in the field with another 50 in management and special operations.  A specialized legal council would also benefit the special investigations team for larger cases.  The increase in CO’s should be distributed equally based on the number of CO’s today in each region. Conservation Officer Background data. The following are general facts about the work of Conservation Officers in 2006:  The current government has been very withdrawn regarding commitments in particular where a paper trail is present and has in fact been under edict to communicate budget short falls in.  In the previous Conservative government, conservation officers had approximately $15,000 a year for expenses, or $300 a week in an economic environment where fuel costs were in the 50 to 70 cents/Litre range.  Under the current government model a conservation officer on average receives 50% less not withstanding inflation.  At present Conservation officers have directive to reduce enforcement targets.  Original targets were established in April 2006, using a risk-based analysis to identify priority areas for enforcement. The 40 per cent cut will therefore affect areas already identified as being at the highest risk.   Conservation officers are being directed to manage by priority the top priorities will be public safety and endangered species.  Operating budget of the Investigation and Intelligence Section has been cut by roughly 60 per cent. The primary work of the IIS involves investigations, including undercover work, around the commercialization of wildlife: illegal harvesting of bear gall bladders, illegal hunting of trophies for sale, illegal commercial fishing, and so on. The normal operating expenses for the Section total about $250,000 per year. This year they will be closer to $100,000.  MNR’s award-winning Flying Conservation Officer program has been eliminated and two Conservation Officer Pilots received surplus notices. This program had provided years of effective access to the remote and sensitive areas throughout the province, especially in the north. MNR says Conservation Officers will use the MNR Air Service instead – highly doubtful since it costs over $500 an hour for an aircraft. The end of the Flying Conservation Officer program means an end to any meaningful enforcement throughout much of northern Ontario.  Most Conservation Officers have been allotted enough overtime to work one statutory holiday and an additional eight hours for the year.  MNR is reducing the number of trucks for Conservation Officers. Three officers will now share two vehicles in many cases. In 1992, when there were 257 officers, there were 257 patrol vehicles. Today, with 173 field officers, there are between 110 and 120 vehicles.  MNR is reducing the number of computers for Conservation Officers.  Officers will now share computers.  MNR has invested tens of millions of dollars in the construction of logging roads for industry. These roads open up new lakes to fish in and new lands to hunt in. With a general reduction in enforcement, these new areas will be like the Wild West for fishers and hunters.  On July 31, 2006, OPSEU made a Freedom of Information request to get the exact numbers for Conservation Officer Budgets Reduction in enforcement The chart below, received from MNR through Freedom of Information, shows reductions in Conservation Officer Enforcement Fiscal Year	# of Contacts	# of Warnings	# of Charges	Active Charges	Completed Charges	Convictions	$ Fine Total 2004 / 2005	281,994	9,541	9,152	453	8,699	6,994	$1,894,876.91 2005 / 2006	263,116	8,934	8,104	1,318	6,786	5,638	$1,415,636.02  Reduction Totals	-  18,878	-  607	-  1,048	865	-  1,913	-  1,356	-  $479,240.89   The IIS needs to be expanded and to be allowed to pursue developers and the corporate sector and increase its ability to levy fines within the mandate currently in place.  At present most fines are minimal and are simply the “cost of doing business” for businesses that break the law.   These set fines need to be readdressed and prioritized into 3 categories, with the determination as to which category the infraction falls within is based on environmental cause, socioeconomic ramification to the environment and other mitigating factors.  All fines within these 3 categories should be increased in effect sending a message that environmental negligence in sustainable building practices can go no further, also these fines should have a ramp up phase for multiple infractions under the initial infraction.  While at the same time if a developer is practicing environmentally sound practices that a tax relief incentive can be devised therefore rewarding good corporate citizens.  Conservation fines should be increased 2 fold again sending a message to Ontario Citizens that breaches against our Natural Resources can no longer go unpunished.  Using the model above we can extrapolate that each Conservation officer was able to generate $7113.75 per fiscal year (2005-06) in fines paid.  Based on our proposal it is anticipated a doubling in fine amounts, a doubling in the number of officers would increase the fine totals to 5.6 millions dollars.  Plus, increased enforcement action against commercial infractions and more effective enforcement should net a 2 fold increase, thus achieving roughly 11 millions dollars in fines per year.   These fines would cover a significant portion of the costs for the increase in enforcement.  Enforcement Bullets:  o	Double the number of conservation officers working in Ontario in 2008. o	Double all basic poaching fines in Ontario with strict minimum fines to avoid smaller fines handed down by JP’s not aware of poaching issues. o	Significant increase in minimum fines to industry and development where infractions under the Fisheries Act impact spawning habitat, water quality and quantity and reduce fishing opportunity.  Minimum fine may be $10,000 a day, with a sliding scale based on severity and repeat offences to $1,000,000 per day). o	Increase CO accountability in the field with increased patrols and enforcement targets. o	Create a mobile CO team in each regional MNR area (north, east, central and south) that work in ‘hot’ enforcement issues throughout the year such as moose hunting season or salmon spawning seasons. o	Consider partnerships with OPP in areas where enforcement needs additional help."
403905,Fang,2009-11-19 21:17:00,1330,I'd pay $5 more a year per license if I knew funds would be used for CO hiring and equipment. At 175K that's 35000 license. Last I had heard there was almost 10x that in resident license sold and almost the same $ in non resident licenses.
403911,Twocoda,2009-11-19 21:33:00,4130,if their pay structure was a percentage of the gross in fines they incorporated   ...you might find them EVERYWHERE....no need to pull more tax paying dollars out of the pockets of the people...inintial investment would be ...trucks...and people willing to enforce..in order to reep the benefits of their own diligence.
403924,camillj,2009-11-19 22:05:00,1988, While I strongly support funding the CO budgets and would also support higher licence/user fees to that end... I would caution that putting the CO's in a position of conflict of interest by tying their income to their revenue produced would undermine the credibility of the entire system and call into question the motives of every officer.... not a good idea I am afraid.
403930,Twocoda,2009-11-19 22:11:00,4130,  yep i see your point ...outside looking in .....but a bad idea is better then NO idea...
403961,timmeh,2009-11-19 23:11:00,609," I agree that this, along with increasing the amount of fines, is the way to go. I would not hesitate to pay an extra $50 for a license if the MNR produced a plan that would demonstrate how the $ would be put to use."
403972,Terry,2009-11-19 23:47:00,14456,"yeah I would not want COs, cops or courts on a quota system of self funding...  want a raise, fine more people......."
403993,Guest Johnny Bass,2009-11-20 00:53:00,0,"$175,000 a year? Dont you think that is a tad too high?Do they buy a new truck every year? I dont even think it would break 40k a year. If they actually had more conservation officers? They could easily afford to pay their salaries in fines. Lots of poachers out there. What I seen on rice lake alone in the spring? A CO could easily net 40K in fines. In a week."
404004,Terry,2009-11-20 01:27:00,14456,"I would hate to think they only make 40k a year more like 80k plus pension sick days med benefits, then equipment, I am sure it's well over 100k for one CO"
404013,Guest Johnny Bass,2009-11-20 01:44:00,0,"  A year??? There are doctors that make 90,000 a year. If a CO makes 100K? I want in!!!!!  40k is over $700 week.  What equipement? Uniform and boots?  Trucks or boats are not bought yearly."
404017,Terry,2009-11-20 01:48:00,14456,teachers make 90k custodians make over 40k the dog catcher makes 65k a co with a gun.....65k to 85k I would think
404021,Guest Johnny Bass,2009-11-20 02:00:00,0,Teachers that specialize in a subject make 90K. Like a science teacher. You want to compare a custodian to a C.O. officer?If Co's are making $1000 or more a week? They are overpaid in my opinion. Real cops dont make that kind of money. And security guards and bouncers are making $11 and hour.
404023,Musky or Specks,2009-11-20 02:03:00,2710,And people you need to remember poaching not as important as habitat destruction despite what you may think. Some one poaches new fish will eventually replace the old. Destroy the habitat = No fish EVER!!!!!
404024,Nemo,2009-11-20 02:05:00,727,Slippery.................slope.
404032,Terry,2009-11-20 02:16:00,14456," teachers in public schools jk to 8  and I was not comparing custodians to a co, I was stating custodians  make over 40k a year there for I would think  a co makes more  a friend was just a regular cop and 15 years ago and he was making 60k.....so I would think he making 80 by now"
404036,irishfield,2009-11-20 02:25:00,26272,"I can't understand why folks throw out fictious numbers in this day and age and then argue about it.... when Google can tell you the facts in a few minutes  What they promise kids at Fleming   Job posting   2100 hour 9 - 5 year would be $70 K at $32.89/hr + overtime + employers match of CPP + employers 1.4 x employee amount of EI + vehicles upkeep/fuel + training expenses + equipment +++ Easily $100K per officer and probably closer to what Harrison started this thread at when you add all the bosses above them and building expenses to house everyone. There is no money being made off the inside workers that out number the CO's greatly. Harrison did state $175,000 / CO including support staff.  Oh.. and I missed the OPSEU union.. add the cost of negotiations etc."
404037,Guest Johnny Bass,2009-11-20 02:27:00,0," From what I hear, the average cop makes about 60k today(I believe OPP make even less) and fire fighters about 50K and I dont think a CO should earn anywhere near what a cop does or a firefighter for that matter. But thats just me."
404039,Terry,2009-11-20 02:39:00,14456,"I base my answers on good info here is a cut and paste basic salary of $80,564 "" Re: 2008 Durham Regional Police Contract  Postby Tank » Sat Oct 04, 2008 11:16 pm The Peel Regional Police rank-and-file officially accepted a new collective agreement on today, ending their unprecedented work-to-rule campaign.  Interim Peel Regional Police Association (PRPA) president Bruce Chapman said more than 1,600 of the association's 2,400 uniformed officers and civilian members voted on the new deal with the Peel Police Services Board (PSB). He said 87.1 per cent of uniformed officers ratified the deal, while 76.1 per cent of civilian members voted in favour.  The four-year deal will see wage increases of 3.21 per cent retroactive to Jan. 1, 2007, followed by 3.19 per cent in 2008, 3.12 per cent in 2009 and 3.25 per cent in 2010. It means a first-class constable in Peel will earn a basic salary of $80,564, up from a top pay of $71,441."""
