136343,GbayGiant,2007-11-23 19:57:00,1780,"Apparently I have a new friend and he likes Walleye carcass.  It's funny my grandma was telling me of these things a couple weeks ago that turn white in the winter and I had no idea what she was talking about, then I woke up today and seen this guy digging around in a bag from two days ago that had a couple walleye remains in it (must of forgot to take it to the dump, lol)  Is it a weasel or mink or martin ? I have no idea, first time seeing one but he is a vicious little meat eating creature.               He had no fear of me at all, I could have kept him as a pet but he might bite my finger off."
136347,Headhunter,2007-11-23 20:04:00,5703,"Not an expert, but it looks like a Marten to me! If it is, yes they are vicious and territorial if push by humans. HH"
136348,Raf,2007-11-23 20:10:00,3495,"yea, don't try to grab one by the tail.   i've a video somewhere of me trying to remove one of these from our minnow bucket out on the ice a couple years back.  lol.  persistant little guys!"
136349,GbayGiant,2007-11-23 20:14:00,1780," I think I remember seeing that. Yeah they look cute as a button, but I wasn't going to attempt to pet him.  But I had the camera only a few inches from his face and he was being calm."
136350,capt bruce,2007-11-23 20:17:00,820,white ones are Ermine    http://nyfalls.com/wildlife/Wildlife-mamma...easel-like.html
136351,douG,2007-11-23 20:20:00,2693,"Dat be a weasel, GBGiant.  They are fearless, and have been known to attack porcupines and bears."
136364,misfish,2007-11-23 20:38:00,29133," Heard the same about you douG.  We get them critters out on the ice ,and here on the rock shores.I always throw a perch or two to them when I see them.Never a crappie though."
136386,Hookset,2007-11-23 21:11:00,367,"SweeeEEEeeet,  OFC has a new Mascot. All new members have to spend a night with the mascot in their sleeping bag. No biggie, their teeth aren't that sharp, and they're small, so they can only eat so much meat anyway.    Hookset."
136389,Bly,2007-11-23 21:14:00,1556,"Awwww, now I miss my ferrets    Nice pictures and it sure is cute but I would agree..do not grab it by the tail"
136443,GbayGiant,2007-11-23 23:39:00,1780," Good link Bruce , it's definitely a Ermine (aka short tailed weasel) that changed white for the winter , according to the stats he was a full grown male."
136456,steverowbotham,2007-11-23 23:58:00,1800,Ermine for sure.
136472,HTHM,2007-11-24 00:23:00,4082,Ermine.....isn't that a $30.00 pelt?
136575,Hooked,2007-11-24 04:50:00,891,"Thats pretty cool.  I seen my first one at 50pt conservation area a few weeks back, looked exactly like that but brown.  I figured they would be up there, but not down here.  Curious little guys they appear to be.  I have also seen other animals long like that, but with much more fur, they run like an inch-worm.  Just started seeing them once they started building the Red-Hill Expressway."
136614,Terry,2007-11-24 13:17:00,14456,this past summer I was wondering why I was losing all my minnows at the dock over night I went to pick out the bucket and it was a lot heaver then it should be I pushed the lid in only to see 2 eyes staring at me I jumped back and screamed like a school girl on her first date.....glad no one was looking... the damn thing got out of the minnow bucket gave me a look to tell me to piss off I  grabbed the paddle and smacked the water beside him he took off real quick and never came back
