136095,CLofchik,2007-11-22 21:49:00,854,"Oh that's nice.  As usual junk science and media hysteria win out.  2nd hand smoke (STS, ETS, et al) is a NUISANCE not a health risk.  Seriously.  Was I glib before, sure because there's little hope in trying to convince people already sunk so deep into the anti-smoking doublethink.  In epidemiology - the branch of medicine that deals with the cause, spread, and control of disease - causal results come in numbers. Anything under the number 2 means there is NO casual relationship. Numbers 3 and 4 show mild casual relationship. Numbers 5 and 6 show a casual relationship. The number 7 is a certainty. Put simply, if I drank milk and were lactose intolerant, my risk for feeling sick would be 7 - a certainty. If I drank water, I could expect no harmful effects - 2 or under.  On average the risk number for 2nd hand smoke comes in between 1.15 and 1.20. Anything under 2 does NOT register as a cause. Some studies even came in at slightly less than 1, which means second-hand smoke may actually prevent lung cancer in non-smokers. Anti-smoking propagandists have tried to suppress many of these studies. Over one hundred studies, taken together, show no cancer causing effects of second-hand smoke.  There is a slight elevated risk between mothers who smoke in eutero and SIDS, but that is the ONLY harmful effect proven to harm children.  At worst, 2nd hand smoke has been shown to excacerbate pre-existing illnesses but DOES NOT cause them.  Sorry, but that's the truth.  Here's a primer on debunking the sound bite junk science that is the driving force behind the behaviour control being forced on us more and more:  The Facts  Nuisances shouldn't be banned, nuisances being masked behind junk science and supporting intrusive gov't legislation into peoples personal space is down right fascist.   Edit --  Btw TMZ.COM, I still hate the nuisances that are other peoples kids"

136111,Sinker,2007-11-22 23:06:00,8692," KyleM.........maybe  you are reading this all wrong. I take non smokers into consideration when I light up. Where is the ignorance in that?  I guess all you non smokers want me to build a separate little building so I'm not smoking outside, or inside? I don't know.....you tell me???  I am doing the least amount of harm to non smokers that I can,  with my smoking.....I do it OUTSIDE.......its the people that complain about me smoking outside that piss me off......I smoke outside out of RESPECT for non smokers.......I can smoke in my house with my kids, but choose not to, I can smoke in the car with the kids, but don't. I don't even smoke in my own vehicle with friends that don't smoke....... Where is the ignorance in that?  And  yes, I fish......lots....I'd say about 150 days a year on the water, either fishing or hunting. Its hunting season right now though, so fishing takes a back seat until the ice is here. I'd bet I spend more time on the water than you do!!  Sinker"

135944,charlesn,2007-11-22 14:13:00,551,"Corey,  This is my first post (and probably last) on this hot topic.  It's obviously an issue bringing out heated emotion from both sides.  Cigarettes are legal and addictive, so is alcohol and pornography.  I don't feel any of them should be shared with or forced upon children as there is literally nothing of virtue in any of the 3 activities.  Gambling is legal and addictive, similar to the first three there are age and location restrictions to go with it.  Unlike the first three, it could be argued that card games (poker, black jack) at least can work to help develop cognitive reasoning and be considered brain stimulating.  Of course non gambling card games can do the same but poker and BJ does not need to be played with money.  Of those 4 things, I think pornography and smoking are the two most similar for the argument at hand.  Watching a porno with someone else in the room (a child) is basically forcing them to indulge in your bad habit.  Most would agree this is not tolerable behaviour.  Drinking a beer is not the same as the baby or toddler will not get a sip nomatter how much they want one.  But the non-consenting participation factor is the reason I think we as adults have to be the ones to make sacrifices in the things we want to do whenever there is a non-consenting party that can be affected in a closed environment such as a car.  We wouldn't slap a porno in the DVD player in the mini-van instead of Dora or Elmo would we?  I have no comment on the health system as I have no idea how it really works and after watching my F-I-L pass of lung cancer last year, I was thankful for the hard working and compassionate nursing staff in the palliative care units.  Had they refused him service because he smoked at some point (he quit 24 years before passing) I would've been upset.  I don't think anyone could do that to a loved one.  Also, where would we draw the line?  I was a second hand smoker for most of my young life and tried a few cigs as a dumb-azz teenager trying to look cool.  Luckily for me it never stuck, but I did try it, does that mean I'm not covered?  I think the cig companies did pay a huge settlement amount for health care or was that only in the states?  Anyways, no offense to smokers, alcoholics, porn addicts and gambling addicts.  Fatsos either.  Charles"
136027,Bernie,2007-11-22 18:01:00,3190,Hes gone..Good stuff.
135224,ecmilley,2007-11-20 23:51:00,2163,"I quit smoking almost 2 years ago, most of my family and friends still smoke and Its only annnoying when they light up in the truck (ya you know who you are) to each ther own I say, common sense would dictate smoking with the kids in the car, not just for there health but the smell eewww. Should it be made law? thats a tough one abd a tougher one to enforce, but with the goverments addiction to taxes even worse than my former addiction to nicotine you'll never see the world's most dangerous legal consumer product outlawed. On the brighter side this is what not smoking fot 47 months paid for (it's almosr paid for). "
135238,Muskieman,2007-11-21 00:10:00,2472,"I smoke  , but not in the truck with the kids..I do if I'm alone and do so with the window open ..  When I grew up .. We'd go for trips to wherever..I'd say "" Mom! the seatbelt is poking me in the back! ""  She'd tell me to stuff it down the seat.. ""Don't roll down the window ,you're letting the smoke out!""...""Give your Dad another beer""...that's how alot of us grew up.                             Now they are just giving monies out for research , if a ""Study Shows"" that such and such thing is bad for you or others... a law will be passed against it.. people knew this was wrong 35 years ago the public was less informed and less involved back then.. With the food they're feeding us nowadays who knows.. better give you're kids all the chances they can get.. ""THEY"" aren't done ""Studying"" the Pepsi generation yet.  I think the law is to enforce common sense...  Gotta wonder how they'd enforce it .. with tinted windows nowadays ?  Would they have a ""S.M.O.K.E"" program like a ""R.I.D.E"" What would be the charges..?  $$"
135246,Daplumma,2007-11-21 00:33:00,1961,Bout sums it up with me.To each his own but keep it away from the kids.There is no good reason on earth for kids to be subjected to the life of addiction that nicotine brings. Joe
135250,Corey,2007-11-21 00:41:00,355," I totally agree with the fact that children should get treatment. I think everyone should get treatment. You say that anyone who does anything that puts their risk at health should not get health care if they need right? So for all the tax's I pay from income tax, PST, GST, cig's, booze, fuel, etc. I should not get any treatment if I come down with an ailment that may be related to something I do?  I don't think it's a matter of stopping treatment for one thing to give money to another thing. It's a matter of spreading the money evenly according to need. I know there is a big push for children with autism to get more help. I probably know more about that situation than you do.  You have no right to say stop giving treatment to people who may do harm to themselves. Better yet, for a thread that started off talking about not smoking in the presence of non-smokers, children in specific, why are you bringing health care up?  I smoke, in my garage, away from my kids. I smoke in my vehicles, not with the kids in them. Pretty much all of my friends had smoking parents when they were young, some of them smoke, some of them don't. The ones who don't aren't all that much worse for wear at this point in their lives.  Keep in mind, I grew up in Hamilton... you know the place that everyone thinks is stinky? The air might not be all that good compared to smoking eh.  I don't smoke anywhere near my children. Obviously I can't protect them from all smoke, but I keep them away from it as much as I can. Should we ban farting near our children too? As I am sure methane can't be all that great for them either. What about banning kids from eating food that could possibly affect their health too? God knows all the fast food can't be all that great. But let me guess... you *never* eat at fast foods restaurants either right? You are the epidimy of health right? Eat a fish from Ontario waters lately?  Take your fight for equal health care somewhere else, we are all pretty much in agreement with you that money needs to be spent on certain areas, but telling me I should not have health care because I smoke? Keep it up and you might need health care soon."
135251,Sinker,2007-11-21 00:42:00,8692," Did I say I was at work?   I was at school......our smoking area is outside the pub.......  Yet another person complaining about people smoking outside......blows my mind.......while sitting in traffic none the less.......HAHAHAHAHA......Ok.....your sitting in traffic......inhaling fumes from thousands of car exausts, and your worried about the guy smoking beside you....  I'm sorry, but this topic really gets me...........  If you don't like inhaling second hand smoke while your outside.......STAY AWAY FROM SMOKERS........its not rocket science........I keep it outside out of respect for non-smokers.....all I ask is for the same respect.  I LIKE TO SMOKE!!!  Sinker"
135253,Corey,2007-11-21 00:46:00,355," Please don't take offense, but if quitting smoking for almost 2 years adds up to 47 months, I will keep smoking!  cd.  ps. good on ya for quitting, it takes a lot to quit."
135257,Guest gbfisher,2007-11-21 01:00:00,0,ha ha ha ha I like it. Yup Thats what all 'users' say when they are told they should quit something that is highly addictive. LOL.  That's what I thought only 5 years ago. Yes! I loved smoking but I love not smoking even better. The last thing I would do is tell some one they shouldnt smoke.
135259,camillj,2007-11-21 01:10:00,1988,Woo hoo ... 261 days for me .... but Im staying out of it ... because I still consider myself a smoker ... just one who hasnt been under the 'control' of my habit for a while ... and would like to keep it that way.  I think the car thing is going a bit .... oh never mind I said I was staying out of it.
135269,danc,2007-11-21 01:18:00,4677,I smoke. I'm not proud of it. Obviously it isn't good for me. Give me my space and I'll give you yours. Don't smoke in the presence of children. How difficult can this be?
135271,Sinker,2007-11-21 01:20:00,8692, God love ya DanC.......finally someone who I agree with on the topic!!!
135284,Daplumma,2007-11-21 01:42:00,1961,Glad to hear you are still doing it.Good job. Joe
135327,John Bacon,2007-11-21 02:48:00,3277," Where do you draw the line at withholding medical care?  If smokers aren't covered for illness, should we also make skiers pay to have a broken leg fixed?  They chose to go skiing.  Do we also refuse to cover people with unhealthy diets; and people who don't exercise?  Smokers are only one of very many examples of people who have contributed to their health issues.  Getting back to the original question; I agree that smoking with children in the car should be banned.  Studies have shown that second hand smoke in a car is several times more concentrated than second hand smoke in a home.  An hour in the car with a smoker is probably worse than a whole day at home with the same smoker."
135339,Greencoachdog,2007-11-21 03:01:00,8163,Awww c'mon and light one up folks... yanno ya want to...
135348,Rich,2007-11-21 03:15:00,3927," I never said it was good.. you just said it was no good for society, which is not entirely true. Just a debate, right?  Like I said, I never smoke in a car with children, actually I don't smoke in a car with a non-smoker. Mostly just to keep them from preaching.  What's with you and the purple haze anyway? I could go on for days about the benefits of wacky tabacky! LOL"
135039,huey graphite,2007-11-20 15:21:00,362, This law is much like the seatbelt law. It's there to protect children from parents without enough sense to protect their own.  I've heard opinions like this from other smokers and it all boils down to one thing.....you're hooked..badly and wil say anything to justify it.
135047,Rich,2007-11-20 15:35:00,3927,I don't smoke in the car with any kids in it anyway. I grew up sitting behind my dad as he smoked away driving. The second hand smoke didn't bother me so much as him constantly getting his ashes on me. I think the law is a good thing and I am a smoker.  What I do hate is going for my breaks to the smoking area and people complaining. Gimme a break!
135066,misfish,2007-11-20 16:31:00,29133," This sounds just as bad as a person that use to hunt and now say hunting is cruel.LOL  Sorry,thats the way I read it."
135075,muddler,2007-11-20 17:12:00,623,"I quit in 1998 (October 11). Until then I really enjoyed smoking. I didn't give two hoots what anybody else thought, I just liked smoking, until my wife got pregnant with our first child.  Even 10 minutes after a smoke, she'd throw up if I just walked near her.  Put a damper on our relationship. That summer I was at my sister's cottage  up north and I was up at 6:00 am tying up flies for the day's fishing. I was listenting to the CBC and they gave a report on the link to smoking and SIDS (Sudden Infant Death Symdrome). It scared the crap out of me. I had to quit now. The next morning the same CBC station gave a report on a a drug call Ziban (not sure of spelling) and how effective it was on helping smokers quit. Went to my doctor a few weeks later and the rest is history.  On the plus side smokes were about $5 a pack then. I was a pack a day smoker. I put $5 in a jar in the bedroom every day for one year. A year later to the day (Oct 11, 2000) I walked into Angling Specialties and got an AngSpec offset float reel ($750) 13 ft float rod and rod building materials and a pile of tackle. I spent every cent of that $1825 I saved  instead of smoking it away.  Amazing how often I hear from someone on the river , ""Well. if I had your money I'd buy a ....blah,blah"" as they light up another smoke and tell me how many beers they drank at the pub last night.  I still budget myselg $5 a day and every October 11 I go nuts and buy a pile of fishing stuff. Wife NEVER says a word about it.  I don't feel any better or worse for quitting., I just have a lot more takle, and two healthy kids.  muddler Just my $.2 or 1825 per year."
135078,Tybo,2007-11-20 17:29:00,1373,"Just another law that cost the tax payer millions to pass and  wont be enforced.  People will keep doing it, Because they will think big brother has gone to far."
135100,Kirk,2007-11-20 18:41:00,347,"Heard on the news, its only in one town in Nova Scotia and its only a 50.00 fine...so go ahead and light up, fine is the equivalent of what? 6 packs of smokes?  Glad I quit about 5 years ago, love feeling better and love the money saved too.  As for health care...my 2 cents: OHIP shouldn't cover anything smoking related...its expensive with very faint hope, just delays the inevitable, if you can afford to p*ss away seven bucks a day for cigs...pay for your own chemo, or cyal8er.  I see the IV hooked up smokers on University Ave getting their free cancer treatment and it really offends me to hear of kids not getting the coverage they need to grow up healthy while the so called 'adults' puff away."
135101,douG,2007-11-20 18:42:00,2693,"It is against the law to subject folks to second hand smoke in bars, restaurants and some other public places.  Why would you choose to afford less care to your kids?  This is abuse, and will soon be recognized as such.  BY EVERYBODY.  I'm still a smoker, btw."
