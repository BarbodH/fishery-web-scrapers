They decided it wasn't fair to make one of them stay with him the whole time so they voted to take turns.  The first guy, Bill, slept with Daryl and came to breakfast the next morning with his hair a mess and his eyes all bloodshot.  The others said, ""Man, what happened to you?""  He said, ""Daryl snored so loudly, I just sat up and watched him all night.""  The next night it was Harry's turn. In the morning, same thing -- hair all standing up, eyes all bloodshot.  The others said, ""Man, what happened to you? You look awful!""  Harry said,! ""That Daryl shakes the roof. I sat up and watched him all night.""  The third night was Frank's turn. Frank was a big burly ex-football player; a real man's man. The next morning he came to breakfast bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, looking well rested.  ""Good morning,"" he said.  The others stared at him in amazement. They couldn't believe their eyes!  They said, ""Man, what happened?""  So Frank said, ""Well, we got ready for bed. I went over to Daryl's bunk, tucked him in, winked and kissed him on the cheek.  He just laid there with one eye open all night. """
