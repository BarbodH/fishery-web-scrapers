135857,bassmastermike,2007-11-22 04:46:00,295,Hey Im Looking to upgrade the outboard on my boat looking for a 115 to a 150 Merc Preferably only a few years old i would also like power trim & tilt This is a must !! Thanks in advance BMM    Here is the pic of the boat i want to upgrade it an 18 foot Tracker 1800 TF.  
135956,fishindevil,2007-11-22 14:46:00,6254,"Hey mike,im not sure what size your boat is but if you can get away with a 115 merc by all means go for it !!!! i was reading about the newer 115 motors and for some reason they are the right size motor and are very efficent,for their size they even compared a 130 and a 150 and for the difference in horse power the 115 is miles ahead,the 150 is about 20% more worse on fuel compared to the 115hp....its hard to say on the puter,but i hope you can understand what im saying....good-luck and do some homework before you buy,and check out what im saying about the 115hp...cheers"
135961,ccmtcanada,2007-11-22 15:00:00,7971,What are you running now Mike?
136034,bassmastermike,2007-11-22 18:23:00,295,Hey Cliff right now im just running a 70 Evinrude with trim & tilt runs great just a little underpowerd for my boat. When i find my new motor this one will be for sale .
136035,irishfield,2007-11-22 18:25:00,26272,2 stroke or 4 Mike?
136037,BFSC Kevin,2007-11-22 18:32:00,1351,"did you check back with percher's brother if he is selling his opti? good luck with finding one! i think i saw one, a 2000 115 johnson for just under $6k. it was at sturgeon point marina "
136044,bassmastermike,2007-11-22 18:38:00,295,Im really not sure Wayne what do you recomend?  I guess it all depends on price and availability. Thanks Kev but i think i wanna go with merc this time for a change ya know.
136047,irishfield,2007-11-22 18:46:00,26272,"All depends what your transom can take for weight. I had a look...only used one at TMarine is a 2004 Yamaha 115HP 4 Stroke power tilt/trim. Asking is $6500 and I can get it for less, I'm sure, if you are interested in going Yamaha. A new 115 Everrude Etec is $10,700"
136050,bassmastermike,2007-11-22 18:52:00,295,   What do you think about Yamaha??? Thats a really good price for a 4 stroke . I guess off season is the best time to buy do they have any pics on there website??
136051,BFSC Kevin,2007-11-22 18:52:00,1351,sure is a nice price....
136052,BFSC Kevin,2007-11-22 18:54:00,1351,"btw mike, you on msn? i think i'm gonna go buy the seloc manual and change the impeller myself... the marinas are charging me $190+ just for impeller change.. damn!"
136053,Sinker,2007-11-22 19:03:00,8692,$190 for an impellor.......WOW!!  I just had the head gasket done in mine for a buck fifty......I had the impellor done last year for $90......  That Yammy sounds like a great deal BTW.......gotta like the yammys!! Haven't heard many complaints about them......it would look nice on the back of that blue boat too  Sinker
136054,BFSC Kevin,2007-11-22 19:05:00,1351,"yeah.. they are telling me it'll take 2 hours to do it and they charge $90/hr then plus parts and tax.. this was at eastern marine systems over in the east end of toronto on leslie.. then i call Klaus marina over in the west end.. they said $190 for parts and labour plus tax... so i think i'll spend $40? for the book and then $30 for the impeller.. learn to do it from the book.. save myself money plus, i'll have the book already if i have any troubles in the future.."
136057,bassmastermike,2007-11-22 19:15:00,295,Hey Kev ive done my own many times if you need a hand Let me know my msn is [emailÂ protected]
136058,BITEME,2007-11-22 19:18:00,1969,Perchers brothers motor will make that thing fly
136060,BFSC Kevin,2007-11-22 19:18:00,1351,"Lol.. yeah mike, i might need to bug you later about it.. maybe even today if they have the impeller in stock.. i already have you on my list... you messaged me the other day while i was sleeping though.. lol"
