136373,Photoz,2007-11-23 20:49:00,792,"I bought a Mustang Atlantic Class floater suit at Lebaron's 'no tax' sale 4 years ago next month. I've worn it about 10 times . . . .      WAY Y Y Y  Y too warm, when ya have to walk a few klicks to your fave whitie / laker territory. Meant for sitting around in sub zero temps in the howling wind I'd say, definately NOT for walking long distances in though! But . . . . .    during some inquiries I've read in the past on this board, I THINK I've heard guys with experience using these things suggesting this floatation material ceases to float after a period of time? Is this accurate? If so, how can you tell, short of jumping in the lake (I KNOW some might suggest I do this) if your suit still floats? If it MIGHT not, what then . . . .  get the 'floatation' material replaced? Toss it? Sell it at a bargain price to somebody you don't like? (Just kidding!)"
136376,irishfield,2007-11-23 20:56:00,26272, Pretty much have to put it on and jump in a pool/lake somewhere to test it. The material will start to disintigrate over time...you can send the suits back to mustang to have them refilled.

136423,Terry,2007-11-23 23:06:00,14456,mine is about 25 years old  I am somewhat afraid to put it to the test I keep saying I will jump in the water in the summer and test it but never remember when I don't need the suit
136424,ccmtcanada,2007-11-23 23:08:00,7971,Yes they do expire Steve....I'll be happy to dispose of it for you.  By the way...what size are you?
136430,ecmilley,2007-11-23 23:17:00,2163,the instructions on the iside of my buoy-o-buoy mention testing it for flotation once a year wearing it in to the water
136432,Photoz,2007-11-23 23:19:00,792,"I'm not sure of the size . . . .    but I had it made by Omar the Tent-Maker! I had considered selling it . . . . .    but then I'd likely get healthy again, and need it!! You see, SOMETIMES I gotta get 'er stripped off . . . .     QUICKLY!! If ya ain't quick enough . . .   ah h h h . . . .    never mind!"
136441,ecmilley,2007-11-23 23:35:00,2163,"I know what you have gone through, so try taking it in for a modificaton, putting in a couple quick access flaps should be easy enouh for a seamstress without affecting the suits buoyoncy"
136445,ccmtcanada,2007-11-23 23:40:00,7971, On second thought...I'm sure it's just fine....
