135836,Sinker,2007-11-22 03:55:00,8692,  Yes bye!!
135987,bobq,2007-11-22 16:26:00,15,did you got the deer?
136021,Entropy,2007-11-22 17:43:00,747,"No, it was gone when I got there."
136079,addict,2007-11-22 20:41:00,475,"roadkill deer is fine for food,just cut away the bruised meat.""its a legal kill if ya keep 2 wheels on the road"""
135509,Entropy,2007-11-21 15:34:00,747,"A deer was hit near near my place of work, it was alive at 7:10am I got there at 7:35.  At that time I would have taken it, but only had 20 min left to get to work.  So, I left it there.  I do have 1 hr for lunch and could go pick it up.  So, Would 4 hrs be too long to not have gutted a deer, and would it still be safe to consume ??  PS.  my lunch starts in 8 min, so a quick reply would be appriciated.  Entropy"
135510,ccmtcanada,2007-11-21 15:35:00,7971,"With the temps the way they are I wouldn't see why not.  If it was 30 celsius I'd leave the thing alone.  That being said, I assume no responsibility on the condition of the meat should you consume it....LOL."
135511,TJQ,2007-11-21 15:38:00,7806,"Best option is to gut it and see... if it looks ok.. then it likely is... lots of deer get left in the bush overnite, when a hunter looses the trail...."
135512,Entropy,2007-11-21 15:41:00,747,"I’ve got a Deer knife, latex gloves, and a tarp in the back of my SUV, just for an occasion like this.  It’s a 12 pointer !!  At 7:35am the Police were going to help me load it up....  Entropy"
135513,snag,2007-11-21 15:46:00,1932, Now that's being organized!  I've got 2 out of 3 of those items just to get freaky in a pinch.
135515,fishermccann,2007-11-21 15:47:00,655,Nice deer! Yes I know someone who used a road killed dear after it lay at the side of the road all day in cool fall temps. and it was O.K.
135519,ccmtcanada,2007-11-21 15:52:00,7971, I saw an episode of American Justice...there was a guy who had that exact stuff in his car who was never caught....they think he fled to Canada...  Oh wait...forget it....  You dont have any issues with me do you?
135520,misfish,2007-11-21 15:53:00,29133,Where did you say it was??????????????
135528,Entropy,2007-11-21 16:07:00,747,Ajax
135535,Entropy,2007-11-21 16:35:00,747,It is gone....... I guess that saves me some work.
135536,Entropy,2007-11-21 16:38:00,747,"  The gloves are good for both First Aid and Deer, the Knife for 'back off get your own vehicle' and Deer, and the tarp for Emergency Situations and Deer.  This would have been the first one,  apparently you have to call the MNR ??  Entropy"
135537,misfish,2007-11-21 16:42:00,29133, Bet you didnt think I could get there that fast eh.LOL
135538,snag,2007-11-21 16:43:00,1932,Maybe it was just napping with it's legs in the air?
135545,Entropy,2007-11-21 17:01:00,747,"   Ya, perhaps.  The cop I was talking to said he was there to 'finish it off',  I should have handed him the buck knife, ""Get to it""  A co-worker of mine said she drove by it at 6:55am and that it was on the road with it's head up.   It had a few broken ribs, 2 front legs were broken, hide on the shoulder was ripped, and one antler was broken away from the skull (the actual skull around the base of the antler was broken).  A bud of mine once came upone a car and deer (with the deer still alive) and took it upon himself to finish the animal,  he could not stand to see it like that, who knows how long it would take for the police to get there.  The driver of the car felt awful, he offered to, 'finish it' and the driver really wanted him to.  He had an axe, and made due with that.  Said it was harder to do than he thought, .... felt bad, but I guess it had to be done.  Is this 'finishing it off' legal?  What would you do?  Entropy"
135549,Jay T,2007-11-21 17:11:00,282,"I have had this happen to me twice, and I have finished the animal off. I couldn't just drive past and not do anything."
135613,ricoboxing,2007-11-21 20:03:00,398,entrophy what street did this happen on?
135614,Entropy,2007-11-21 20:04:00,747,hwy 2 .... why ?
135616,Entropy,2007-11-21 20:05:00,747,the deer today or the one that my budy finished ??
135617,ricoboxing,2007-11-21 20:10:00,398,when driving east on the 401 i always (sometimes) see these deer near the forest just west of lakeridge. I always wonder when theyre gonna jump the fence and try to cross the 401. I guess they decided to go the other way.
135618,Entropy,2007-11-21 20:15:00,747,"This was one of them !!  I'm sure I saw this one 2 days ago in the field running.  ""His"" field is totaly swamped with geese, as is the driving range to the east, and to the west they are starting to put in another subdivision.  To the north there is a newer subdivision and the Casino.  I guess it's just a matter of time before they get desperate / start to relocate.  Too bad,  he was a nice animal = good genes lost."

135626,jedimaster,2007-11-21 20:36:00,3472,Hopefully he spunked a few does before running into a car.
135720,Sinker,2007-11-21 23:44:00,8692,"You should have taken it while you could. I would have put it in the truck right then and there......especially if the cop was going to help you with it.  It would have been AOK!! I picked up a 10 pointer earlier in the fall.......the guy that hit it didn't even slow down, just kept on going. The deer was in the oncoming lane......dead as a doornail. I figured someone had to at least drag it off the road  before someone else hit it. Called the OPP, they told me to take it if I wanted it.......so I did......Freezer is loaded  I got one last year too......on my way duck hunting.......big 8 point on the shoulder. I stopped to check it out and it was still bleeding......steaming.....so I slapped my buck tag on it and threw it in the back of the truck.....lol.....then went duckhunting.....ended up with a big 8pt buck, and a limit of ducks that day......    Sinker"
135734,misfish,2007-11-22 00:02:00,29133,Ya gots to be a newf.LOL
135760,nautifish,2007-11-22 00:58:00,1416,"Well not sure how many of you know port dover but yesterday morning we had a big buck get caught up in a fence at the high school here, After manageing to free its self it went loopy and lunged through the front window of someones house..  ....Yes somones house. Not sure how it got out but last it was seen was on the beach here a little later that morning. Still waiting to here what came of it.......About a week ago i was driving the old lakeshore road at about midnight and a huge buck came out infront of me and this thing was big scared the bejeeber's out of me.
