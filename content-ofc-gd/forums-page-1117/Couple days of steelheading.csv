136097,chickenhawk,2007-11-22 22:12:00,612,Tuesday afternoon fished from 1 p.m until dark and put on a show landing 4 gorgeous hens and losing 3 other fish. It sure was fun seeing everyone standing there since first light and not catching anything and I come down and start hammering into them haha sure is funny!  Thursday morning fished the mouth of the river that everyone else already knows of before i mentioned it on here. and smacked into 3 nice males bout 5 or 6 pounds each.  My buddy landed a nice male resident brown as well bout 5 or 6 pounds again.  Don't worry guys pics are on there way in a day or two.

136107,highdrifter,2007-11-22 22:34:00,2534,Sweet!  But ya might wanna be cautious when it comes to specifics...  I know some float fisher folk who are exremely protective of this creek..  That one doesn't need any more pressure than it already gets.  Might wanna save yourself the flack..  I can feel tremors!  It'd be nice to see some fins though!  tight loops HD
