135991,yellowboat,2007-11-22 16:39:00,211,"Well me and my GF went for one last fish until Ice up last weekend, we got skunked on Saturday and had to break the boat out of the 1/8th inch of ice on Sunday and for this we were rewarded or I should say I was rewarded with my second  an PB musky 46 inches long.  Sorry for the small pic can't figure out how to resize it.   "
135993,Weeds,2007-11-22 16:43:00,782,"Nice Fish, deserves to be resized but I can't tell you how to do it as I'm pretty useless with computers. No more musky for me this year but I'm already dreaming of June........"
