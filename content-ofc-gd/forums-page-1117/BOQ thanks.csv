First and foremost I would like to Thank TJ and his crew of bandits for making it all possible for without him none of this would take place. We are all brought together by a common interest and the most fantastic brainchild of TJ Thank you Thank you Thank you. And the only other thanks I want to place is for the 2 guys I fished with Percher and Pointed. I have known both these guys for over 30 years we have fished partied chased skirts and all things in between for a long time although no biological connection exists I view them as my brothers and would fight to the end for both of them. Spending time with these 2 guys is priceless and forever burned into my head everytime we are together, I hope we have many more years and many more tales and live happy lives to the end. I love you both and would react to anything in a heartbeat for you   My 2 cents Peter"
