135862,Bernie,2007-11-22 05:05:00,3190,I was cleaning the old pics off my camera tonite and came across this pic from sometime in early summer. I twisted and turned the pic to see which angle it was taken. It appears to be the proper way. Not sure why this person is horizontal.    He appears like he may be a Black Russian.
135867,KyleM,2007-11-22 05:42:00,218,some sort of poor northerner in an alcohol induced coma?  Sad really LOL  Maybe its the Canadian Fonzy
135868,bassmastermike,2007-11-22 05:48:00,295,I think TJ fell down and spilt his drink!!!! LOL
135871,CoolB,2007-11-22 06:48:00,47,That's a tame picture for TJ.......is that Crappiesteve in the background?
135876,Spiel,2007-11-22 09:27:00,9065,  ....Yep that's a tame one (his eyes are still open)....lol And yes Aaron that is Crapiesteve.
135905,Joey,2007-11-22 12:38:00,9122,"Now just take a good look at that picture.  TJ is the poster child for the Canadian Northerner eh!  He's got on a Hawiian shirt and a lumber jacket, he's falling down drunk, but happy as a clam and indicating he's okay.  I'm betting the last thing he said was ""Hey, Steve, hold my beer and watch this.""  Joey"
