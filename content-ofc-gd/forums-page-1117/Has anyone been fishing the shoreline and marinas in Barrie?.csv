This will be my last chance to go fishing in Canada this year, so hopefully I can have a few fun packed hours of catching fish - no matter what size they are.  Has anyone been fishing there?  Are there any perch in the marinas - any jumbos.. or maybe some pike?  Is the marina open or iced up?  Any other good spots to try?  Any other tips would be appreciated.  Thanks 007"
136188,issamhay,2007-11-23 04:18:00,77,"Dont know about the Pike but there should be Pike becuase they follow the perch, there are tons of perch there however be warned it can get extremely crowded, since that area is so overfished there arent that many jumbos, however still very fun as you can get bites non-stop."

136199,snag,2007-11-23 04:48:00,1932,Don't count on pike.  Have fun and hit the town.  Cheers!

They didn't catch a lot, and since they generally only keep 10"" & up, the never got a 'keeper' between 'em! They were just south of the fountain, casting slip floats, with about 14' under 'em, yellow/green tubes and 1/32 ounce jig head, about 75+' out, just past the drop-off."
136221,misfish,2007-11-23 11:22:00,29133,"What drop off???????????????HAHAHAHA  One word of caution.If you have a floatation suit,I would wear it.The docks can be very slippery and I have seen guys trip over the rope ties."
136316,007,2007-11-23 18:32:00,537,Thanks guys....  So from the advice so far I guess I need to dress up warm with some shoulder pads on and fight for a spot to catch some small perch in the freezing cold - the true Canadian fishing experience - can't wait!  Anyone been down there this week?  I presume the marinas aren't frozen?  Cheers 007

I've tested all along there with a float and heavy sinker . . . .     found that about 14' seemed to get the best results. And you sure are right about those floating docks, I've seen 2 people unintentionally test floater suits at the marina!"
