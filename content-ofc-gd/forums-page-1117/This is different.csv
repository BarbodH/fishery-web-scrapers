From the page:  * Now you can pack your fishing gear and no-one will even know * A quite amazing feat of micro engineering, this sleek pen is actually a telescopic aluminium rod that extends out from the case to a full 4'/1.2m * The attendant miniaturised reel is fully functional, with line brake/clutch and switchable ratchet so you can use if left- or right-handed * The retracted rod measures 8""/20.5cm long including pen-style lid * Supplied with 80'/25m of 5lb/2.5kg break-strain line and spinner hook.   http://www.expertverdict.com/ProductDetail...product=1124232"
