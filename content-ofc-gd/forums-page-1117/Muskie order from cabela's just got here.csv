136477,glen,2007-11-24 00:44:00,2641,"I just got some muskie stuff from Cabela's.  A few big donkey lures, 65# braid and a bunch of other stuff.  But the reel is not what i wanted (it's broken).  The stupid plastic push bar is broke right out of the box.  When it was put in the box it must have been slammed home like a Joe Carter home run.  The outside of the box looks mint.  I hate the clicker on/off button it is hard to use.  I am not too sure about the push bar either.  I don't want to carry ten spares for a days fishing.  So i ask you should i get a different brand or get Cabela's to fix it or take it to the repair shop?  If i ship it back to Cabela's i think i am on the hook for the shipping.  "
136497,danc,2007-11-24 01:33:00,4677,"I think Cabelas provides a postage paid self addressed sticker with their orders, for returns. The address is a Canadian address in Hamilton I believe. At least that was the case when I last ordered. Just send it back. They'll look after you. Did your pro line arrive in one piece Glen??"
136500,glen,2007-11-24 01:44:00,2641,I got the pro line thanks Dan.  I did some tests on it and it is good.  I hope to use the 6lb on some brook trout.  I didn't see that address i will look.  I just don't know if i like this reel.
136542,Roy,2007-11-24 03:48:00,13728,The Cardiff is not a muskie real Glen. The thumb bar is the same as the Corsair thumb bar.....it's the weakest link. I imagine you should be able to switch reels with the Cardiff.
136545,irishfield,2007-11-24 03:49:00,26272,You should have been after the TE401 Calcutta Glen... not the Cardiff
136560,KyleM,2007-11-24 04:28:00,218,I have pounded my Cardiff but I have the tiny one and I use it for throwing spinner baits at buckets...  Not sure I would use it for skis
136644,glen,2007-11-24 15:33:00,2641,Well i am over my fishing budget for a while so i have to cheap out a bit and this is the only left hand reel i can find.  It's rated for 245 yards of 14# line so i thought it might be strong enough.  I could go to an ABU C-4 6500 but it is not any better i bet.  Too bad the Pete Maina reel is not left hand.  I hope its ok for one muskie anyway.  Or maybe i can find a used one or one on sale.  I have a bit of time now to make up my mind anyway.  I also have to keep in mind that my little boy is 3.5 years old and he likes to throw things overboard.  Thanks for any ideas.
136658,irishfield,2007-11-24 16:30:00,26272, If you keep going out on GBay with me Glen...it'll do you just fine! We never get to see the drags get a work out anyways!
136672,SlowPoke,2007-11-24 17:37:00,2984,"I have a Corsair, caught three skies on it so far and it hasn't blown up (yet). I'd be the first to admit these are not muskie reels but not bad if you're on a budget. I don't use it for trolling anymore, the Penn 209 gets the nod for that duty. I'm saving the Corsair for casting duty now until I can afford an upgrade. I'm finding it tough to fish so many species on a budget and most of my equipment is dual purpose at this point. If I had to wait to afford the best equipment for the task at hand, I wouldn't be getting out much. -Brian"
136692,glen,2007-11-24 19:01:00,2641,SlowPoke i am looking at the Penn 209M left hand for trolling.  Then the Cardiff would be for casting.  I think Penn is coming out with a new Penn 209M line counter this year.  I guess i would get the line counter.
136735,SlowPoke,2007-11-24 21:47:00,2984,"Yup, Penn 209LC but I don't think they have a lefty. I had two ordered for pickup from LeBaron's and they didn't receive them in time for my Quinte trip so I cancelled the order. I'll get them locally."
