136669,Riparian,2007-11-24 17:28:00,269,Could anybody that likes to use this method for catching whities and lakers on the ice let me know how you build them and use them properly?
136733,Fisherman,2007-11-24 21:45:00,7201,"Honestly, it's cheaper to buy them, 2 or 3 way spreaders,  put a small minnow of each hook, lower to the bottom for whities so that it's just touching bottom, when the tip up raises, gently set the hook, it will be a whitie.  You can also add another single hook up about 2-3 feet, add a minnow, often lakers will take the offering."
