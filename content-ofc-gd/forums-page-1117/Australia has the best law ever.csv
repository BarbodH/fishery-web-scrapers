136160,danc,2007-11-23 02:32:00,4677, I assume from your name that you're a Bass fisherman. Perhaps you'd like to explain to the Carp fishers just exactly how it's done. Tell us how you practice c&r with the Bass that you catch.
136167,Rich,2007-11-23 03:01:00,3927,"Ah yes. Nothing beats bass fishing. You cast out 50-80lb braid, the fish hits almost instantly and you horse it in with barely a struggle. You do this 50 times during the day until you get bored of catching so many easy fish.  Carp are superior in every way, heck they even survive better. But nah, kill em. They're ugly."
136169,bassjnkie,2007-11-23 03:11:00,1101,"You know what, everyone has thier own views. Im out. Next year regs will have carp as a sport fish, mark my words. And to piss alot of people off, we are in the works to get 2 rods per person for carp on the Larry.  Have fun, Daniel Ontario Carp Hunters Pres."

136200,FishFinder,2007-11-23 04:49:00,481,  How would a fish go from invasive to sportfish :S

136210,lew,2007-11-23 10:07:00,12767," C'mon Steve, now really, why on earth would anyone ever wanna say nasty things about something as purdy as a musky"
136213,Spiel,2007-11-23 10:34:00,9065," Well there you go they've changed the board rules and no one told me. I see now that if you are passionate about something it's okay to respond to a post by breaking the several rules as opposed to responding intelligently.  Oh decisions, decisions. Let it stay, remove the thread or just and individual post. Perhaps I should lock it up? Maybe I should post my personal thoughts on this invasive, undesirable, destructive intruder from Europe or my experiences catching them. On second thought maybe I could post an intelligent rebuttal without having to resort to name calling, baiting and general boorishness. Then again maybe my post is general boorishness and now I'm guilty of breaking the rules. Oh I know how bout something to get around the word filters, *&^% !%$, nope that's against the rules as well! Oh my what to do?   Perhaps I should be put on mod queue!"
136215,Bassloadingzone,2007-11-23 10:41:00,32,"   Well if it isnt the caped cursader himself, mister anti smoker come up with such inteligent comments like you just did, but its always the geniusous that come out name calling first, and ya you sure have earned the right to name call, cus everyone of your posts are so smart, and you would never start a post that might cus a ripple, or is just if its your opinion its alright, and to bring up brainpower, was the testing pretty hard for the field you were smart enough to excel at, or ya thats right you were a Cab Driver, wow I bow down to your great wisdom.   Ya that carp fishing sure looks like it takes a great deal of out smarting the big brained carp, sit on your   slingshot out a bunch of meal worms, or if your real smart a dog treat, maybe some catfood, for the real pros, but im sure where the real work starts( after years of practice) is making sure you cam match up the holes on your 40ft acme fishing pole"
136216,Spiel,2007-11-23 10:49:00,9065,....Oh another intelligent post. Time to lock it up!  If the two of you wish to continue this diatribe take it to PM's!
136156,MJL,2007-11-23 02:23:00,2427," I have a different view of what a “true-sportsman” really is.  I do my best to appreciate and conserve our natural resources.  I try to take the time to help other anglers out there on the water who look like they need it or ask for it.  I spend time introducing youngsters to the sport.  I give free lessons on basic fly casting and fly tying lesson.  I pick up trash where I find it. I have volunteered in tree plantings. I respect all fish (even gobies) if I decide to release, harvest or dispatch them (when the law deems it necessary).  Having fished for carp for most of my life (I grew up fishing with the Brits), I see an opportunity for kids to catch something with relatively inexpensive tackle close to home in fairly good quantities – Not all kids have parents who own boats or can drive them 2hrs north to go fishing.  You can even take the public transit (I do myself) to fish for carp.  A 10lb carp to a kid might be considered as that catch of a lifetime.  Carp can be caught in a variety of ways.  Lefty Kreh (perhaps the king of modern day fly fishing) has mentioned that carp are just as exciting to catch on the fly as any species on the saltwater flats. You can stalk carp in the margins which is a lot like hunting.  You can take them off the top using floating dog biscuits or bread or dry flies.  You can float fish for them either using waggler floats in Stillwater ponds or trot stick floats down rivers using corn, maggots, worms, bread on steelhead sized hooks.  You can sit back in the shade, prop up a rod on a stick and take a nap.  You can make carp fishing as simple or advanced as you want to.  All methods will work.  Some of North Americas most distinguished anglers and writers – IE. Gord Pyzer, Al Linder, Doug Stange and Lefty Kreh have all written about carp fishing and their amazement to how such a fish could be neglected as a viable sport fishery.  The main argument against carp is that they increase turbidity in lakes and rivers when they feed which can decrease the amount of light which penetrates through the water column –The end result is plant life will die.  Where I fish, a 50hp motor at the back of a boat doing full tilt can cause the same effects along with increased bank erosion where wakes eat away at the shoreline – Anyone out there who fishes the Otonabee will agree.  Placing dams or obstructions in rivers can trap sediments above them causing even more turbidity. IMO, man has done more harm to our lakes and rivers than that of carp.  With zebra mussels in many of our watersheds, a little turbidity doesn't seem like such a bad thing.  Carp have been in Canadian waters since the late 1800’s.  If you enjoyed the fishing 40-100 years ago, perhaps there’s another underlying cause to a declining fishery.  MNR reported that black crappies were decimating walleye fry populations in Rice lake several years ago…Carp often get the blame.  From what I’ve read in books (some dating back to the time of Izaak Walton) and seen in films, the only discernable difference in the gamefish classification is that most “real gamefish” have an adipose fin and are usually either predatory in nature or tasty to the pallet.  If carp weren’t related to the minnow or sucked food items off the bottom, perhaps we would see a different means of classification.  Suckers, sheepshead, gar aren’t classified as gamefish…Should we throw those on the bank?  Like the USA, Canada and parts of Africa, There are some parts of Australia which are rapidly becoming a Mecca for trophy carp angling and providing lakes for tourist anglers to fish (catch and release).  Not all areas in Australia enforce this law.  Contact Tony Davies Patrick (aka Globetrotter for more details) – You can google him up for contact information and/or purchase a copy of his book (Globetrotter’s Quest) for his accounts on carp fishing in Australia.  With the threat of global warming, increasing levels of pollution, exploitation and severe harvest of our resources, how many of your beloved “game fish” will survive in the future?  I fish for steelhead the rest of the year and currently, numbers aren’t the same as they used to be.  I always say carp are the fish of the future…When life throws you a lemon, you make lemonade.  My thoughts on carping"
136159,Bassloadingzone,2007-11-23 02:25:00,32,"   But our choice of fish doesnt kill spawning grounds and get to be 40lbs because it eats all the eggs it can from real fish,pretty sure the MNR feels the same way, or do you still think the carp die off was due to a lack of oxigen"
