135978,ecxstriper,2007-11-22 15:52:00,343,Had one and returned it .  The reel prefromed  well at first but didn't hold up after a few large fish  were land using it .
135983,Headhunter,2007-11-22 16:16:00,5703,"Although it's not the same reel, just ask Gerritt or Bill Parker how much I like my Okuma line counter! It is poop! HH"
136081,addict,2007-11-22 20:42:00,475,buy a pfluger
136093,Greencoachdog,2007-11-22 21:44:00,8163, You caught a large fish?
136193,ecxstriper,2007-11-23 04:28:00,343,  Well by your standards it was huge .  Yea the pfluger trion is a sweet reel . Just ask Bly and CCMT that is what they use.
136195,Hooked,2007-11-23 04:33:00,891,"Thanks for the input all.  I already have 2 Pluegers, Trion and President.  Like the President, wasn't too keen on the drag on the Trion, plus a gear broke inside rendering it useless.  Still gotta contact Plflueger to try to get that part."
136264,Lefty,2007-11-23 15:09:00,14,I own one and can't say I've had any problems with it. It been rattled around in boats and in the truck and has a few battle scars but is still smooth as the day it came out of the box.  L.
