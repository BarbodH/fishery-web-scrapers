136252,Bob Devine,2007-11-23 14:27:00,251,"The Bondy Bait has caught fish on other bodies of water too. Jon not only has a jiggin bait, he also has designed one for casting. For those who don't know who Jon Bondy. He is the only Canadian fishing the Bassmaster Elite series and guides the waters of Lake St. Clair, Detroit River and Lake Erie. Jon created the Bondy jigging bait to catch deep water muskies in the current of the Detroit River. It works very good and can be used on other systems as well, like the Niagara, St. Lawrence and Ottawa."
136254,Entropy,2007-11-23 14:29:00,747,"Been there, done that, taped it up and headed out for another..."
