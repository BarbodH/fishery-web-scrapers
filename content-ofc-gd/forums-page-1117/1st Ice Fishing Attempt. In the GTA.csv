136417,dsn,2007-11-23 22:53:00,1018,"Hard water in the GTA means ice fishing. This is my first attempt at ice fishing in the GTA. I saw these bubbles and some of the bubbles look fresh . (Carptracker  ) The ones that have been around for a while are white. The fresh bubbles are darker.  The ice was a solid clear sheet. Slightly less than half an inch thick. Unsafe to stand on, let alone walk on it.  It was hard to break. I managed to break it with something heavy.  You can see the clouds forming from fishing swimming away under the ice. Oh how frustrating, I can see them but I can't cast to them.  My rig or whatever I cast just bounced off the ice and slid all along the surface.  Not even a dent in the ice.   I busted out the corn and chummed the hole. Lovely colors too I migth add.  Then I seen them all swim by leaving a trail of smoke under the clear ice.  And that was it. The ice fishing was over they never came back.  So Then I decided to try softwater. Went to an other location in the GTA. Fish on!! Fought pretty good. Few head shakes even took out drag!! Carp? Salmon? Trout?   Turns out to be a pike. I think I'll stick to the softwater.    Nice size too I might add. It had a belly also.  I was trying to find out where was my lure was and how deep it is. So I turned it on its side.    Then I found that it took the cleo in deep!! I gently lifted it up and took it out. No damage. Took a quick pic for my record keeping and back she went.  I was going to head out yesterday but couldn't make it with 007. Sorry bro.  dsn"

136426,007,2007-11-23 23:10:00,537,"Nice ice shots dsn!  I guess those carp would have been fair game for us the other day when we had planned to go fishing - before the white stuff started falling from the sky and the water got that hard coating!  Was pretty disappointed that I didn't go out fishing on my day-off but it was a shocker of a day weather-wise.  Good to know there are still some pike around, though I don't think I will get chance to fish for them now - running out of time :-(  Glad you caught a fish and got some nice photos for the album.  Was that caught with your telescopic Shimano rod you mentioned the other day?  I would be interested to know more about the rod.  007"
136428,dsn,2007-11-23 23:13:00,1018,yeh I was at BPS the other day and spent $200 bucks there. The shimano ExAGE STC Telescope was $67 bucks. Light weight easy to carry on the transit system. I also bought camo backpack for $14 bucks.  dsn
136474,007,2007-11-24 00:28:00,537,Hey dsn- is that rod good enough for carp - what line strength is it suited for? What length - when extended?
136488,dsn,2007-11-24 01:03:00,1018,  Yeah I was using it for carp this summer til a carp stole it from me.Its a 7 foot rod. funny it doesn't say what weight it is. But my guess is your standard medium.  dsn
136501,mepps,2007-11-24 01:54:00,1301,nice fish!
136502,ccmtcanada,2007-11-24 02:01:00,7971,Great report DSN!!!  You always get GREAT pics...love the one of the carp hightailing it away from you.
136522,fishindevil,2007-11-24 03:05:00,6254,"PERSISTANCE PAYS OFF !!!! well done,those pics of the fish swimming under the ice look cool  .....at least you ended the trip with a nice fish !!!! great pics...cheers"
136524,bassmastermike,2007-11-24 03:11:00,295,Great Pics Nice looking Pike too !!!!
136534,Joey,2007-11-24 03:38:00,9122,Great report.  Love the action shots.  What do you have a camera on your head and it takes a picture if you blink twice or something  Joey
136556,Victor,2007-11-24 04:09:00,1609,i love those pics dsn! i wonder how the fight's gonna be like if you hooked into a good sized carp during the hard water session ...  u'll probably need lots of line on ur reel to handle carp on that exage ... especially the big fat ones in lake o
136596,dsn,2007-11-24 11:02:00,1018,  Hey there's an idea!! dsn.
136597,dsn,2007-11-24 11:03:00,1018, I figured I'll worry about that when I get a fish on. dsn
136599,Shelley Cooper,2007-11-24 11:15:00,394,Great shots.... Love the report dsn....  Thanks for sharing...
