I hear there are some end-of-the-year clearance sales on rental fleets at various outfitters... think I might drive to some tomorrow...  Any recommendations on a decent 'tripping' canoe (preferablly under 65lb)? I am considering a used Swift kevlar/glass blend... what about brands?  I mostly paddle lakes...camping, a little fishing, the odd solo jaunt.. but mostly tandem.  Thanks"
