135674,Minnow,2007-11-21 22:08:00,177,Hey guys planning on heading out this weeked for some steelies on the Lower Niagara and have a couple questions hoping you guys can help me out  I know to use the 3 way swivel rig and was wondering if cured roe will work and whether or not minnows will work?  Also is it best to do drifts right by the launch or further up or down river?  Thanks any tips are really appreciated!

The fish usually do not start prefering minnows until the water gets down into the low 40 F range and below. There are good drifts at the launch, up, and down river. The best drift can change from day to day or even hour to hour. So if it is not happening at one drift try another. Good luck."

If you like using lures, a kwickfish/flatfish worked near bottom works great all season long.  I should also mention, lures work best in clearer water."
