A buddy and I made it out to Lake Erie yesterday, as for the first time in a while the wind gods were smiling on us. We had a great day that started at 6:00AM to make it to Port Maitland by 6:45. When we arrived at the boat ramp we were slated #8 for departure. The procedure went as slick as a Weasel's privates and we were on the water in no time. After searching for a bit we found the desired secret location (follow the twenty other boats) and quickly Gary grabbed this 3 1/2 lb. beauty. He was using a greenish Yum Dinger with black and red specks that was Texas rigged weightless.  A short time later I got this 4 1/2 pounder (the picture doesn't do it or me any justice). I was using a Berkley 6"" Gulp worm with a twisty tail in pumpkinseed, regular worm rigged. What a fight, magic!  Then we moved around a bit and I nabbed this 2 pounder on a wacky rigged (with O ring) GRN PMP/CHART Yum Dinger  We had a lovely visit from the OPP and everyone that we met on the water and at the ramp were extremely friendly. Jim (And yes, I do look like a door knob in that life jacket. I am hitting Santa up for an inflatable)"
