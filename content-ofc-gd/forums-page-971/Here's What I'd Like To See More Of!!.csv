Ryan Simko, 24, pleaded guilty to the charge under the Public Lands Act. Court heard that on November 11, 2007, a conservation officer located an abandoned campsite in the Township of North Kawartha. The occupants of the site had left behind broken beer bottles, beer cans, broken spotlight, broken radio and a ripped tent which was still set up. The officer conducted a lengthy investigation which resulted in Simko being identified as one of the occupants of the site. Simko was charged with littering. Justice of the Peace Carl Young heard the case in the Ontario Court of Justice, Peterborough, on June 12, 2008.  Not the first time I've heard of this . . . .    too bad the Ministry didn't have the manpower & time to do more of it . . .   MADE MY DAY TO SEE IT POSTED!!"

245831,maybe,2008-09-02 14:15:00,307,What on earth does that poor guy with the growths have to do with litterbugs?
245832,jwl,2008-09-02 14:25:00,1056,"good on them for getting a fine..specially a young guy getting $1000 fine, that will put a dent in the wallet, some fines for fishing infractions and such are too small.  I can think of a few areas around the Niagara region that can use some enforcement like that...fortunately alot of people I know including myslef will bring a garbage bag along and clean up around the fishing area...but you go back and it's the same thing all over....worst culprits....WormWanch conatiners..Timmies cups, water bottles...like come on, if ya can carry the full containers to the hole with ya, surely they are not too heavy when empty to carry out..just ask my wife when i come home with squished coffe cups and stuff in my pockets...I bet I can go into my winter coat right now for example and find old line, and lure packages at least..lol"
