245350,sleded,2008-09-01 14:16:00,96,Well sunday moring me and my girlfriends cuzins husband skiped out of a wedding brunch thing and we headed to the ponds out in the tin boat and i was hoping on putting him on his first large mouth he has ever caught. Well  we worked the pond pretty good for about 6 hrs and he ended up landing 4 small bass. He told me this is the best type of fishing he has ever tried since hes from BC they only fish trout and salmon out there and this style is great and he had a blast. Well I lost two big bass way back in the pads should of brang my big pole but forgot it of course. I ended up getting two bass one was not a bad size for a small pond which i got on a black mamba! soon as it hit the pads she smashed it right on the surface!  I had a really great time fishing these ponds get out there while summer is still here.   brads first large mouth bass
