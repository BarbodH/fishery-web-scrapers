I did not have a boat this time so for me it was all shore fishing. I caught myself a  PB largemouth bass for this lake. It weiged in at 4.1 lbs. I caught it on a Yum Dinger early morning off the dock. Here are some of the fish i caught:  4.1lb Bass   And another shot of it   Little topwater bass   Testing out the BPS popper   Testing out another new lure and look what went for it    Here are 3  yum dinger bass:  1.10lbs   2.3lbs   1.9lbs   I went to a small river and fished a green tube jig and caught a dozen of these:   I also did some cat fishing with corn at night off the docks, managed to get 6 little guys.   And here is a picture of my brother with his best bass of the trip. Caught on a black and blue crankbait.   We had lot's of fun and caught lots of fish. I can't wait to go back there again!!"
244953,Greencoachdog,2008-08-30 19:51:00,8163,Great report and pics!!!  Those cats will fry up real nice!!!
244960,TennesseeGuy,2008-08-30 20:22:00,957,"Mike, that's some pretty good catching, especially since you were shore fishing.  Taking Bro along was a good move.  Keep it up."
244963,Smokey,2008-08-30 20:37:00,1278,"Some pretty awesome shore fish, Congrats and Thanks for the report.  Mike"
245014,MCTFisher9120,2008-08-31 00:54:00,3761," Ya he loves to fish, he just has a problem waiting for the bite. That fish really made him happy and he still is talking about that fish."
245018,BillM,2008-08-31 01:03:00,17367,Nice fish!  Did the bass make it back into the lake or onto the table?
245022,MCTFisher9120,2008-08-31 01:12:00,3761, She made it to the table. I never had fish from this lake before and man did it taste good. I have not had those cat fish yet but they are waiting for me in the freezer.
245047,Domi Fish,2008-08-31 02:22:00,46,"I got one question for you Cronzy jr. Why the hell would you keep a bass that size for the dinner table? Was there no other food around?..I dont get it. Please explain.  There's nothing wrong with keeping a few fish to eat, but is it really necessary to keep a fish of that size. I dont know call me crazy but I think a bass that big belongs swimming around in Lake Seymore, not in someones belly."
245053,MCTFisher9120,2008-08-31 02:45:00,3761, As i caught the fish around 5am I needed to put him on a stringer untill my grandparents woke up (9:30am) so i cauld get some photos. It would of been a waste of a fish to release after being on a stringer(can wreck the gills) If this fish was caught later in the day i would of been able to release it after a photo no damage done. A fish that big deserves a photo in my mind.
245075,yo_guy,2008-08-31 04:56:00,111,I can't stop laughing at the Cronzy Jr comment. LOL  To rephrase the response above what he meant was your entitle to keep fish but try to be more selective when harvesting and please let those big guys/gals swim another day.  Those smaller bass would of been much better tasting. Nice picture at any rate!!!
245114,Paully,2008-08-31 13:14:00,712,"Thats a nice bass, did ya have it with Fish crisp?... anyone fall off that dock?.. looks like it needs some TLC."
