245337,Brander,2008-09-01 13:47:00,4,I was out the last couple of mornings and the salmon are dead slow. I was marking fish but hooking into them was a different story. Eventually I got desperate and went out to 300 FOW and went for steelheads at about 30 to 75 ft. I ended up getting one 7 pounder just after lunch. Other than that its just been a slow slow week for the slamon.

245822,lucabrasi,2008-09-02 13:29:00,114,"They were summersaulting last night at an eastern mouth, but not interested in the cleo."
