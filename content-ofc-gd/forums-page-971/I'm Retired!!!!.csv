244646,Dano,2008-08-29 19:53:00,719,"Well well Roger, please accept my heartfelt congratulations on your retirement, I think that is just fantastic. On the other hand, you do look kind of young to be retiring.....  Lol Terry, once again we are in the same boat!!"
244647,tybrad,2008-08-29 19:56:00,45,Congratz on being retarded.   I mean retired
244652,motv8tr,2008-08-29 20:29:00,2587,Awesome!!! Enjoy!!!!  Maureen
244653,Garry2Rs,2008-08-29 20:30:00,1425,"Hi Roger; Congratulations on a great career with the Big ""D"" and welcome to the land of Retirees. This is the place where you have nothing to do, and all day to get it done! HAHAHA Garry2R's"
244661,fishnsled,2008-08-29 21:13:00,3520,Hope you had a great last day.  Now get out there and go     All the best Roger!
244663,danbo,2008-08-29 21:19:00,2646,
244694,Sandbag,2008-08-29 23:09:00,533,Wow....38 1/2 years Roger.  I hope you enjoy every minute of your retirement..you deserve it.  Cheers  Craig
244713,Rustic-Fisher,2008-08-30 00:01:00,826,"Good for you Roger!!!  :clapping: I can see it now.....Roger, the new full time fishing lead at BPS!!!! See ya in the shop,  Congratulations, Ryan"
244783,Nanook,2008-08-30 01:37:00,565," Congratulations Roger ! Only you are semi-retired. Retirement means clearing up all the jobs that on the back burner,   THEN get a  part time job to get you out of the house for a rest.  Enjoy !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
244792,danc,2008-08-30 01:48:00,4677,That's just awesome Roger. Congrats and enjoy your free time.
244815,Clampet,2008-08-30 02:35:00,1947,I'm not retired just tired.
244890,Rich,2008-08-30 14:40:00,3927,"Congrats! Just 38 1/2 years to go for me, lol"
244898,Mattones,2008-08-30 15:19:00,587,Congrads!   Now you can be a part time Wal-Mart greeter lol
244915,Mark Kulik,2008-08-30 17:10:00,348,"Congrats Roger, 38 yrs is a long time to work in any one place-you certainly earned it! guess I'll see you at BPS more often now-we'll have to get a coffee. PS my wife will send the logo out this wknd.  Mark"
245248,bpsbassman,2008-09-01 01:30:00,941,"Thanks everyone.  Its great to celebrate with you all.   John, I'm thinking sometime in October would be good.  I'm too busy until then   That's already marked on the Calender Connie.  One of my ""50 Things to Do Before I die"" or Bucket List   I'll take you up on that coffee Mark.  I'll buy"
245250,bigbuck,2008-09-01 01:33:00,2449,Congrats!! Enjoy your retirement!!! Now get out on the water and catch some fish!
245273,OhioFisherman,2008-09-01 02:27:00,6623,Congrats Roger! Working at BPS is about as close as you can get to fishing without being on the water.
245280,TennesseeGuy,2008-09-01 02:58:00,957,"Okay Roger, fish with us before you die, but don't expect to die just because you join us.  Get ready for a surprise.  We're a tea drinking bunch of Mother's Oats eaters.  Early to bed and late to get up.  Takes us two hours every day to sort out all of our pills and get them swallowed.  With me leading the pack we have to trick our bodies into making it out on the water."
245317,bpsbassman,2008-09-01 11:39:00,941," I'll do what I have to, to get my hands on one of those world class pike you seem to catch so casually.   :D"
245320,Big Cliff,2008-09-01 12:23:00,6899,"Congrats Roger! Just don't do what I did, I retired in 2003 and now I work longer and harder than I ever did when I worked for a living LOL. Retirement for me is doing what I love to do, when I want to do it (well doesn't always work out that way LOL)."
245325,TennesseeGuy,2008-09-01 12:35:00,957, That's explained in the story about blind hogs and acorns.
245327,Whopper,2008-09-01 12:48:00,2174,"That's bunk!  The following is a quote from a very respected angler "" Talking to you about the pike at LV is a waste of bandwith, TG knows what the pike are doing, when and where, almost down to the minute"""
245490,mepps,2008-09-01 18:16:00,1301,Congrats Roger!
244454,bpsbassman,2008-08-29 11:32:00,941,"Well after 38 1/2 years, today is my last day at Dofasco  :thumbsup_anim:  It has been a fabulous place to work and I will miss my ""Dofasco family"". Now there is more time for family, fishing and friends!! Hopefully, I will now have more time for my OFC family and get a chance to fish with a few more of the great people that inhabit this board. Oh yeah, I still have to get up tomorrow morning to go to Bass Pro, but let's face it, how can you call it a job when they pay you to talk fishing with the customers  :lol: Have a GREAT day everyone, 'cause I know I will!!"
244458,John,2008-08-29 11:47:00,2956,"Congratulations Roger, I know that you will be missed. Let's arrange a Grimsby swill and catch up."
244459,ccmtcanada,2008-08-29 11:53:00,7971,Congrats!!!  A retirement well earned I must say.  Enjoy your retirement....and good luck!
244464,Victor,2008-08-29 12:12:00,1609,Congrats Roger! Now I'm going to expect to see more fishing reports from you
244470,dustink,2008-08-29 12:25:00,526,Congrats Roger!!!  Only about 25 years to go for me....  Dustin
244476,Roy,2008-08-29 12:36:00,13728,Way to go Roger. I know that you'll be busy enough not to miss your Dofasco family too much. Stay healthy and get the most out of what you've worked for.
244480,Beans,2008-08-29 12:57:00,3339,Welcome to the wonderful world of retirement...  Hopefully you will soon wonder how you ever had time to go to work !!!
244481,JEREMY,2008-08-29 12:59:00,300,Congates to you Roger  i hope to see iyou in march when I make my annual trip to BASS PROYou are a great guy to talk to while i am there.
244483,Joey,2008-08-29 13:03:00,9122,"That's super news Roger, congratulations.  I'll bet we can expect alot more fishing reports now eh  Enjoy  Joey"
244487,Guest Fishing For Life,2008-08-29 13:05:00,0,"Ok, i dont know the details .. but it seems to me that you have had two jobs @ Dofasco & BPS?"
244488,steve_paul,2008-08-29 13:08:00,658,"Congratulations Roger, enjoy retirement and the extra time with family, friends and fishing."
244497,JohnF,2008-08-29 13:42:00,3494, OK. I'm envious.  So now when we visit BPS we can just follow the sound of maniacal giggling to find you?????  JF
244499,Radnine,2008-08-29 13:43:00,1538,"Congratulations on getting out of Dofasco while there still was some semblance of Dofasco to get out of. Now lets work on that commute, is Grimsby Tackle hiring?"
244515,TennesseeGuy,2008-08-29 14:24:00,957,"38 1/2 years should be enough.  Enjoy your new life, but be careful what OFC people you fish with.  One of your buddies stuck a huge treble hook into my thumb.  It's time to get your dance card filled.  Like May 2009."
244518,tonyb,2008-08-29 14:31:00,1637,Congrats Roger!  Looking forward to seeing lots of reports from you know with all your free time
244529,BeRad3000,2008-08-29 14:59:00,65,ENJOY  !

244591,cpguy29,2008-08-29 17:42:00,148,"Congrats, but why is the retirement age 65 in this country, should it not be 50 max"
244611,BillM,2008-08-29 18:25:00,17367," Why should it be 50?  If someone wants to work and is able to, I don't see the problem."
244622,Uncle Buck,2008-08-29 18:50:00,1000,"Congrats bud,  I never would have guessed you're that old... LOL"
244629,Spiel,2008-08-29 19:05:00,9065,"....That's absolutely FANASTIC Roger and an incredible milestone to say the least. I'll be starting my 30th year at the neighbouring facility this fall and I know what you mean about the work family. It'll be a bitter sweet day for me when I get there.  Congratulations, you've earned a long, happy and healthy retirement and I hope you collect on it."
244634,Terry,2008-08-29 19:15:00,14456,"that is great  I am still counting the days weeks  months years  wait, tens of years , dang it's a long time before my wallet will let me retire"
