When I arrived a father-son combo were fishing the area. As there was lots of room I joined in the fishing. They told me they had a very large largemouth following their baits but it refused to bite. This place is not a common place for large bass mostly small to medium sized at best. I was using my light fishing set-up of a Daiwa Shock 5 1/2' combo. loaded with 2 lb test line. I tied on a small red chatterbait type lure and started casting. On my second cast I thought I caught up on weeds when I felt a head shake. Sensing this was a good fish I played it easy. Here's the result.    A 19 1/2"" smallmouth. They were sure this was the same fish the seen earlier. The father even ran up to my car to retrieve my camera for me so his son could take the picture. I was not expecting catching anything big enough to bother bringing the camera down to the hole.  Best Wishes: Rick  BTW: The fish was released to fight another day."
