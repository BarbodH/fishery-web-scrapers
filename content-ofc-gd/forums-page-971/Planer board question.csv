When I set up and got the boards in the water they seemed to sit a little odd in the water but still pulled out to the sides as they should. The problem arose when I tried to set my ten colour lead core up and out to the end of the board, the weight of the lead core set up caused the board to sweep in and be almost straight behind the boat. I tried both sides with the same results. I know these boards will pull 5 times this weight, I have seen it on the charter. I hear guys talking about squaring up your boards and wonder if this could be my problem and if so how do I correct it? Rest of the day we dragged a dipsy on each side as well as a lead core off each rear corner with no takers. Talk on the radio seemed to be that it was a slow day for most. It was a beautiful day to be on the water no matter what the results were."
