245608,Garyv,2008-09-01 22:29:00,547,"About a year ago I saw a few vehicles with Ontario plates towing trailers with boats behind them.  I knew you could do it with a fifth wheel but upon checking with the OPP and the Ministry of Transportation was told it's illegal.  Well had a camper leave the park today with a pop up and towing a trailer behind.  Did some checking and found this on the Ministries website.  Towing More Than One Vehicle Cars, passenger vans and SUVs are not permitted to tow more than one trailer or one vehicle. Motor homes, trucks, pickup trucks and truck campers are legally permitted to tow two trailers or a trailer and a motor vehicle behind a trailer. However, a three vehicle combination that is swaying excessively, is unstable or has reduced handling capabilities is subject to action by the police as an unsafe combination of vehicles under the Highway Traffic Act.  The maximum length of any combination of vehicles is 23 m (75' 6"").   Either the law has changed or one hand doesn't know what the other is doing."

They said it was legal as long as we did not go over the maximum length allowed from front of truck to back of boat.  He also mentioned to be very careful as the boat would act as a swing going around corners.  We opted not to chance it and just got our friend to go camping with us on the first weekend, leave the camper up for the week with us and then camp with us the weekend after.  Worked out pretty good.  Joey"
