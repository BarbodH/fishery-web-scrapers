Fishing was slow, but steady on harnesses.  Only 3 large fish made it to the boat. Gotta warn ya, some of the fish porn is kinda graphic. Even Santa   needs a tan   One 30"" freight train. Watched him smack the lure as it hit water. The Mrs.  The fish theiving dog. Eats the head and tail and leaves the bony middle alone.  A little appetizer for tomorrow's brekkie.   Wifey did have a pig smallie up to the boat but it gave that one last jump and said 'bye bye'. I wasn't fast enough with the net."
