245279,OhioFisherman,2008-09-01 02:51:00,6623,"Garry is right about the rod, lighter action rod for lighter baits.   http://www.fostersofbirmingham.co.uk/st10785  Another option, these reels, same style as the 507(500) series were much more popular in England and European match fishermen, only sold in very limited quantities here. A fixed spool reel, drag is in the winding mechanism, just helps to eliminate line twist. Ryobi I believe made a conventional spinning reel with the same sort of set up.  704 is a newer model and smaller (lighter) than the 507, closer to the 505 506 size reels. LOL they cast much better than conventional closed faced reels, line opening is much larger over all. Less friction."
244737,Garry2Rs,2008-08-30 00:51:00,1425,"I think that the rod is the culprit here. The MH is a 1/4 to 1 ounce rod...It won't cast baits under 1/4 ounce very well. Drop down to a Medium or a ML and you will be fine. Some adjusting of the reel might be necessary. But start with the settings that you have now. The centrifugal brakes are to stop the spool from turning faster that the line is going out at the beginning of the cast. Don't do anything rash with them. Change rods first...then make reel adjustments based on what happens on the first couple of casts, not on hear-say from other guys with other equipment and different casting styles. Garry2R's"
244791,Bassaholic,2008-08-30 01:46:00,74,"You should have no problem casting a 5"" senko on a good MH baitcast rod. A standard 5"" senko should weigh around 3/8oz...at least all the ones I have do. So they should load fine on a MH fast to extra fast rod but would be too heavy for most ML rods. Also what kind of cover are you fishing? Because I wouldn't use one and I dont think many other people would suggest using a ML rod in heavy cover like weeds or timber and if you're like me and thats the kind of stuff you're tossing you're senkos into then I think you're going to be in trouble if you go with a ML."
245008,bassjnkie,2008-08-31 00:18:00,1101,"ML is not what you want, unless you don't fish in heavy cover. MH is the way to go like I said before, make sure it's extra fast and push all the brake pins in except 2, as someone mentioned earlier. The xtra fast action will allow you to load the rod with even a dinger (lighter than a 4"" senko). Someone metioned this, that a magnetic brake is the best to cast small baits, with less over run. The Curado 201 is ok for heavier baits, but if you want to stick to shimano, the 101 super free is the way to go. My suggestion would be magnetic, I love all my Daiwa baitcasters, I can throw anything, wind changes, by just a few clicks on the external brake dial. Shimano, well you got to open the side plate and hope you don't loose the red pins. I am not bashing Shimano in any way they make some great products.  Hope this helps, I can go more in depth, but e-mails easier on the eyes.  Daniel"
245081,OhioFisherman,2008-08-31 05:59:00,6623,"It can be tough if you don`t have a lot of experience with baitcasters. I used old shimano 251 black magnums with 10# test mono(Stren) newer model reels like a curado should work also.  Best reel far and away for it is this http://cgi.ebay.co.uk/abu-507-boxed-mint_W...id=p3286.c0.m14  Old style Abu 507, 506, 506m, 505, Abu Preimer 704, 507 is the biggest and will easily handle 17 or 20 pound test mono, smaller ones good for 10 maybe 12 pound test. No line twist at all with these reels and hard to find a better night fishing reel. They are getting pricey. No problems flipping or pitching and unweighted worm or lizard, 1/16th 1/8 ounce lures."
245149,bassjnkie,2008-08-31 15:53:00,1101,"I agree with the closed face reel to, virtually no tagles. I Throw spinners with a spinning reel, 6# mono line, no swivel, and never get line twists. Line twists are from user error, reeling against drag, spooling reel improperly, lower priced reels etc... Just my 2c"
