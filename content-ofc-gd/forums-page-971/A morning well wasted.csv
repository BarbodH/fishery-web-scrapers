Most days I am stuck on shore because of health probs.(Wifey won't let me out on the water by myself any more} Anyhow, son got up early and we were down to the river just as the fog was lifting. It was just beautiful and quiet. Too perfect. With all the minnows swimming around, the bass weren't interested in our offerings. Just the odd short bump hear and there. Went up a feeder trib to pick apart timber and the son finally got something to make it worthwhile for him.  A 3lb tree hugging bucket. As for me I got the white stripe. That's OK. I got out, enjoyed a beautiful day out and relaxed. Better than being stuck at home."
