244999,TennesseeGuy,2008-08-30 23:17:00,957,You both win because you went fishing.  It's a tie and the tie breaker awards the championship to the guy with the better report card.

245036,Smokey,2008-08-31 01:42:00,1278,I'm with TG you are both winners and congrats to both of you on a great summer of fishing.
245116,MCTFisher9120,2008-08-31 13:25:00,3761, You are right we both did get lot's of nice fish. I used new lures and new plastics and had my fair share of success. My next question is what baits am i going to try out next year.

245210,HTHM,2008-08-31 22:20:00,4082,"As it said in the official rules thread, the poll would last two days. Currently I am on dial up, soI cannot see the reports, however I am confident in the rest of the board's judgement and ask roy topm me the winners name at the end of the voting time. I will then get the mailing address and send off a brand new shad rap. I hope to see the reports when I return from Sask at the end of the week. Congrads to you both, I hope you had twice the fun!"
