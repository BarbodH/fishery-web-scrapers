Her family has a cottage on the lake and we havent been there all year, I havent been there for about 3 years, but remember catching some nice smallies last time.  After a bit of a fog delay, we got started.  I was throwing a wacky worm and Kelli was throwing a #3 Mepps Aglia when she landed this little beauty, and may I stress LITTLE    We moved down the shoreline a bit where Kelli landed this little guy on a pink senko.    I started throwing a lucky craft jerkbait in about 12 feet of water and landed this guy, good way to start my morning.    Threw him in the livewell for pictures later on.  The action was pretty slow for the rest of the day with only a few fish here and there.  We got our better fish on jerkbaits and tubes, but Kelli got her biggest (around 3.5 pounds) on a lucky craft rick clunn crankbait in 16 feet of water.  Here's me with the biggest two, the bigger fish is Kelli's.    Here's Kelli with her biggest two.    And the two of us together    After the pictures we were about to go release the fish into deeper water when the wind picked up a little bit.  I decided to hit one more spot real quick.  I figured the chop might turn on the jerkbait bite, and I was right ... first cast ....    and just a few casts later    Check her out a little closer    And that called for a new pic ...     AWESOME DAY ON THE WATER!!! We're a little red and crispy, but a great way to cap off a good summer!!"
245231,bucktail,2008-09-01 00:34:00,1857,Nice fish! Spent a day up there this summer and got a few ones but alot of follows. Have they moved deeper yet?
245243,bpsbassman,2008-09-01 01:03:00,941,Looks like a great day on the water Steve. Well done!
245266,steverowbotham,2008-09-01 02:13:00,1800,"thanks, i was pretty excited to catch a tagged fish"
245311,Chris,2008-09-01 11:19:00,405,Very nice smallies dude
245318,Cudz,2008-09-01 12:17:00,2652,Great day! Nice fish...I have 10 lucky craft lures and have managed only 3 fish on them.  Oh well.  I also lost a custom painted pointer 100 on the third cast when my fluoro leader decided to give up.  Not cool.
245323,BeRad3000,2008-09-01 12:31:00,65,"Man you guys know where to find biggie smallies. A tagged fish thats pretty cool, why do they do that?"
245328,canadian_copper,2008-09-01 12:58:00,925,BEAUTY FISH BRO!!!
245332,steverowbotham,2008-09-01 13:20:00,1800, To track growth and migration patterns
245359,Leecher,2008-09-01 14:26:00,7832,Great report and pics Steve  Football size smallies for sure! Thanks for sharing Leechman
245397,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-09-01 15:34:00,0,"Great report! Some nice hogs. I stopped using hard baits for at least 3 seasons, unless there is Pike around. Caught a lot of monster bass on Georgian Bay in the fall on big Husky Jerks. May have to go back to them for bass! Thanks for the report."
245695,Jigger,2008-09-02 01:35:00,1237,"Good job out there Steve! Those are some beauties for sure! My in-laws also have a cottage up there and we've been up pretty steady since opener. What were you reading for water temp? I could swear my finder has a glitch. I woke up to 68deg on the water this morning. Lots of tagged fish in there, sometimes its the only thing you can see when you drop a worm in 15fow is the tag going toward your bait. Caught a few today, two with tags, this one was pic worthy. Came on a wackyrigged watermelon worm from 12fow.   Great report man, if you're up that way again, drop me a line! Were you in a red or blue bass boat?"
245769,steverowbotham,2008-09-02 07:42:00,1800,I was in a 17.5 foot legend.  Nice fish btw.  12 feet seemed to be where it was at. I had 68 when we launched and 75 by 4pm
