245285,CLofchik,2008-09-01 03:14:00,854,"With the delight most armchair experts have for atlantic salmon posts lately, I bring you this.  The goal of the exercise is to illustrate how most salmonids can be positively ID'd with just the tail, also usually the most popular part to get cut off or covered in most ""ID My Fish"" posts.............remember, the tale is in the tail!

245330,Greencoachdog,2008-09-01 13:04:00,8163,"1. Atlantic Salmon... the anal fin tells me this.  2. Brown Trout... looks like Richs bled out Brown!  3. Rainbow/Steelhead... spots on tail in radiating rows  4. Chinook...leading ray on anal fin extends 1/3 the length of the fin  5. Sheepshead/Drum.. ugly  If I got any of the first 4 wrong, take into consideration that the only Salmoniod I've ever caught is a Lake Trout... and they're actually a char eh?"
