Must have got 35 or so fish at the boat site...lost track after a while...We've had four double headers of which we've only lost one fish and got all the others to the boat! Great majority of the fish caught were released with 4-5 smaller ones kept for the BBQ...Some did pretty good acrobatics today so theyâ€™ve deserved their freedom back ;-) Mostly bows from 4 to 15 Lbs but got few Kings in mid teens. 30-40 feet down in 370 fow. 2.7-2.8 mps, black/green spoon did most damage, but black/purple, black/white and blue/silver all got fish as well. Very violent hits especially on the riggers...glad I kept loose drags or just might have lost a rod or two ;D Did lose one spoon that a huge bow took down to the bottom Oh well...part of the game I guess... Started at 6am and stopped about 11am when they slowed down. Great day on the water....almost no wind....the small black flies were getting on my nervs at one point though.... Was considering waiting for the air show but got too hot so we called the day....  Here are few shots from the day:     Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
