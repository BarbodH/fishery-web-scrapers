244945,Greencoachdog,2008-08-30 19:14:00,8163,10-4 TG!!!  They've upgraded Gustov to a catagory 4 now with winds of 145 m.p.h... looks like it'll be another catastrophic catagory 5 when it makes landfall...
244980,oxcowboy,2008-08-30 21:58:00,544,"TG,  glad to hear your daughter is back and safe.  your right about her man, those workers will need people like him to help keep them going during what looks to be another major hit.  my hats off to him and the rest of the health workers that will have to stay.  best wishes,  jason"

245087,Badger Shark,2008-08-31 06:54:00,291,"I really hope people are a bit wiser this time round.  My mother lost everything in Katrina including the town she lived in, Pass Christien Mississippi.  80% of the homes and 100% of the businesses were destroyed.  The local city oficials are still working out of trailors 3 years after the fact.  You really only ever hear about New Orleans but in reality it did not get hit with the worst of Katrina.  The reason for what happend in New Orleans was the scouring of the levees which were and still are only rated to a Cat3.  The towns to the east of New Orleans were harder hit, i fact the eye came ashore in Bay St. Louis/ Passs Christien with a 33 ft storm surge and 145mph winds virtually wiping out everything in its path.  In Pass Christien there was a Pole in the harbour that showed storm surge heights from past storms withCamille being the measuring stone at 21ft, well Katrina blew her away.  I was there less than a week after and I will never forget what I saw, you could not even tell what street you were on, it was heart wrenching.  People were living in tents and under tarps on what was there property and alot still are today 3yrs after.  I went back last year and the town is still mostly in ruin and also went into New Orleans, when approaching the city it was so erie, picture driving into a major city with all the suburbs surrounding it and seeing that no one lives in any of the thousands of homes and the streets are empty and stores and malls are all boarded up.  It certainly makes you feel really alone and gives  you a scope at what happend and what most likely will happen again.  They should have just left the areas flooded and reclaimed by mother nature the way it was intended, people have not come back to those areas anyway and most likely wont.  And on the origional topic, if I was staying in New Orleans I would definitely buy protection as well, especilly after Katrina."
245199,Greencoachdog,2008-08-31 21:20:00,8163,"The wife just came in and was tellin' me about an interview she saw on the Weather Channel with a woman that lives on the Gulf Coast and was going to ride the hurricane out in her basement with the help of a mop, charcoal, and a few steaks...  The Darwin Awards should be interesting this year!"
245235,Wild,2008-09-01 00:42:00,704,People are reporting that it's too expensive to flee and one lady won't leave her two rottweilers behind!  looking at the radar you can see the hurricane already beginning to afect the weather as far as Tennessee
245242,Greencoachdog,2008-09-01 00:57:00,8163,Pets are being evacuated as well:  http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/26485726/
245519,timmeh,2008-09-01 18:51:00,609,"I will take this opportunity to apologize to those offended by my first post, it was a bit of a sarcastic remark that was ill timed and poorly delivered. I responded too quickly without really thinking. It was not my intention to paint all Americans with the same brush, but I clearly did so, and understand why some are upset. I'm sure this article does not represent everyone and many of you probably found the idea of buying guns in an emergency like this as ridiculous as I did. However I find it ridiculous that a magazine would publish an article like this as in my opinion it gives off a terrible message. It is things like this that give people the wrong impression.  Sorry to those unfairly judged, hopefully you can accept my apology and move forward,"
245538,Greencoachdog,2008-09-01 19:40:00,8163, That was a very nice apology timmeh!  ... and accepted here with no hard feelings at all Bubba.
245561,aplumma,2008-09-01 20:22:00,6896,Apology accepted I have also in the past and I am sure in the future typed without thinking. Now tell us a good fishin story.....    Art
245566,TennesseeGuy,2008-09-01 20:43:00,957,I would not buy guns for an upcoming disaster.  Why not use the ones I already own?  They are legal and I'm comfortable with using them.  First time gun owners can be dangerous.  Guys with stolen or looted guns can be dangerous.
245593,Greencoachdog,2008-09-01 21:53:00,8163,"  You're absolutely right TG. I need  another gun like I need another fishin lure! The most I can shoot accurately at one time is one, I'm pretty good with the .22...but I'm deadly with the pellet rifle!!!"
245667,holdfast,2008-09-02 00:49:00,1813,I have been told that the Canadian DART team are now confirming personal and Equipment for possible task again in New Orleans.  Also a Navy Ship is also on standby in the area to react for assistance
245678,Greencoachdog,2008-09-02 01:02:00,8163,"  ... and we will be very grateful for the help should we need it!!!  The storm has turned out to be the catastrophic event everybody was hoping it wouldn't be, but it's not over yet. High tide won't crest until about 1:00 a.m. in the morning and some levees already have water coming over the top of them... hopefully everything will hold!"
244593,Whopper,2008-08-29 17:46:00,2174," Thanks Joe and I knew what you were trying to say in the first place. You are correct, this community is without boundries, so this shouldn't be any different than guessing weights and lengths of fish lol I'm sure if one of your southern neighbors painted your countrymen with a broad brush we would see some of the same comments. Most of us from down south that visit your fine country know how most of you feel about us, we all put our pants on the same way...well except GCD"
244612,TennesseeGuy,2008-08-29 18:25:00,957,"My daughter has been in Tennessee working on a documentary film, but left at 5 p.m. yesterday for her home in New Orleans to pick up valuable papers and her cats.  She slept fast after a long drive and is now heading out of NO.  Her man will probably be staying sinces he's doing his residency internship at a New Orleans hospital.  I'm sure he'll be put to work or at least standing by for what might be coming.  I chatted on-line with her for a few minutes this morning.  Told her what to have in her car, told her I wished she would have a carry permit for protection, and instructed her to get her back to the wind and keep going.  Also told her I'm here to do whatever I can for her.  Unlike Kathleen Blanco with Katrina approaching, Bobby Jindal has been ahead of the curve."
244615,scuro,2008-08-29 18:32:00,386,http://www.wunderground.com/blog/JeffMasters/show.html  A good website for detailed Hurricane info.
244619,Greencoachdog,2008-08-29 18:47:00,8163,"The part about Mr. timmeh post I didn't like was his failure to capitalize the U,S, and A in U.S.A... I'm sure he wouldn't like it if I spelled Canada like this canada It ticked me off to have to write it that way, let alone look at it... and I'm only Canadian by marriage!!!  He also decided to paint the whole U.S. with a Cajun paint brush, something I find highly offensive!!! We only let the Cajuns  stay down here in the Deep South so the folks from Mississippi will have someone to look up to and because they make us Alabama Rednecks look smarter than we actually are.  ... don't get me wrong, I like the Cajuns... they're some of the nicest folks you'll ever meet, they'll give you the shirt off their backs, and they sho'nuff know how to Party! (Mardis Grais) (.)(.)... they just aren't the brightest candles on the Birfday Cake.  The rest of Mr. timmeh's statement clearly showed that he really didn't know what he was talking about. A hurricane in New Orleans wouldn't be something you would try to survive... it is something you flee from!!! That's why they call it a mandatory evacuation... for people that are too stupid to know when to leave!  Here's a little cross section I found of the city of New Orleans:    Yes New Orleans is a valuable shipping port, is it a good place for one?... no... not really.  Here's an article I found a little disturbing for the folks that might think they'd like to stay and tough out a hurricane in N.O.  http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/26444204/  I really do hope that all the Gulf coast residents learned their lesson with Katrina and they'll all evacuate so there won't be any lose of life... material things can be replaced, a human life cannot!"
244624,ccmtcanada,2008-08-29 18:58:00,7971, I wish your daughter and her man all the best!  Hoping they stay safe thru Gustav.
244637,TennesseeGuy,2008-08-29 19:20:00,957,Thanks Cliff.  I'm not exactly as comfortable as I try to appear.
244861,Greencoachdog,2008-08-30 12:53:00,8163,Uh-oh!!!  http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/26459330/  Anyone that has friends or relatives on the Gulf Coast... please urge them to evacuate!
244922,TennesseeGuy,2008-08-30 18:04:00,957,"GCD, thanks, we're okay here.  My daughter, Allison, left Cookeville, TN Thursday at 6 p.m. and arrived home in NO at 3 a.m  She slept fast and left at 7 p.m. Friday with her two kitties, important papers and computer, arriving in Nashville at 5 a.m. this morning.  Shawn stayed behind to work ER at University Hospital and will sleep at the hospital.  He might get a year of experience fixing up injured guardsmen, police officers and firemen in the next few days.  He showed me his stuff by volunteering to stick around.  Next I need to get him on the shooting range with me.  I insisted that Allison be in the first wave to bug out."
