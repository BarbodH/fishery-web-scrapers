245613,evster,2008-09-01 22:38:00,367,"My wife and I decided we wanted to spend today doing a bit of fishing.  This is my last week with the boat I borrowed for the summer so we needed at least one more outing.  We woke up at the crack of 9:30 and were down to the lake by shortly after 10.  Wow, it was smokin hot already!  It was probably one of the hottest days I fished this year.  Maybe not the hottest temperature but absolutely no wind at all made for a rather warm one out there.  With the sun high and no clouds I figured the bass would be hugging the shade.  So we focused on fishing overhangs and logs near shore close to deeper water.  I think we made the right call.  The first decent bass of the day was this guy which I pulled off a submerged tree with a senko, he weighed in about 3 pounds.    Then I skipped another senko up to an overhang and this guy picked it up right away.  A bit bigger and the scale was saying about 3 and change.    I would have been happy with those on a day like today, and those are about as good as I have gotten out of that pond.  A bit later I skipped the senko under an overhang and it had to have gone 3 feet into the overhang and I just heard a big splash and could tell my line was tightening up so I gave a good hookset and used the element of suprise to haul this girl out from a nest of twigs before she got hung up.  My best largemouth so far.  My scale was bouncing from 5 to 6, but I figure it was just a tad over 5 by the size of it.  She was fat.    The good news is I finally outfished my wife, the bad news is she got skunked and wasn't to happy about it  .  But I think this years season has really helped her enjoy fishing alot more.  Now I just need to get my own boat.  Anyone know of a cheap 14 foot tinny???  I got the trailer all ready to go  ."

245619,Leecher,2008-09-01 22:58:00,7832,"Great report and pics evster  Real nice and chunky bass, congrats on your PB and thanks for sharing Leechman"
245620,evster,2008-09-01 23:00:00,367, I hear ya.  Her and her senkos.  This time I fished the senkos and she got to fish the real lures like flipping jigs and spinnerbaits!  Kidding...she was doing the same thing I was which was weird that she got skunked.

245780,Rich Clemens,2008-09-02 10:59:00,3131,"Nice buckets there evster.  I've been out-fished by the wife (and others) many, many times.   Keeps 'em happy and coming back for more.   Good luck in your search for your own boat."
