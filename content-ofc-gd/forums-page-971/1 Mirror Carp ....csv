245082,CLofchik,2008-08-31 06:17:00,854," I gave up the minimalist fight and switched over to hairs & maize, heck at $3/5kg bag it's even cheaper than Wonderbread Even bought a feeder, going to get kicked out of the Cheap Carpers Anonymous now..........  And yes, I caught a carp missing half his face that was still very much alive AND feeding.  Put up a decent scrap too!  Damn resilient fish those carp."
245151,bassjnkie,2008-08-31 15:57:00,1101,Nice mirror guys. WTG  Sine we are showing them off:  Daniel      Scott  
245269,Marko,2008-09-01 02:20:00,854,Took me two days to find this picture but here is the last one i caught. Its not very big but very pretty 
245375,Photoz,2008-09-01 14:47:00,792,"Has anyone of you carp guys ever caught a LEATHER carp? In 6 years I've caught about 8 mirrors, one fully scaled . . .    beauty fish . . .    but never caught a LEATHER, or saw one caught, or even know anybody who has caught one, or seen one caught? I've only seen a few photos of these elusive fish . . . .    I don't recall if any were caught in Canada though?"
243406,dsn,2008-08-26 00:32:00,1018,I caught my very first mirror and I didn't have my digital with me. I thought .. see one carp pic you see them all so I didn't bother bringing my digtal. I should have.   dsn
243407,Greencoachdog,2008-08-26 00:35:00,8163,You know the rules...   no pics... no believe!!!
243411,hammercarp,2008-08-26 00:55:00,964,Is that it? Could you tell us a bit more? What were you using? Where were you fishing?
243412,hammercarp,2008-08-26 00:57:00,964,Oh and sorry. Congradulations on your first mirror!
243426,Beans,2008-08-26 01:50:00,3339,Not to worry...some of us believe you when thousands wouldn't...  CPH and I have not taken any pictures since last year...not much to take pictures of anyways...  Maybe a change of scenery will make a difference this week...
243428,Greencoachdog,2008-08-26 01:54:00,8163,  ... of course the non picture takers believe the other non picture takers!
243464,CLofchik,2008-08-26 10:48:00,854,"Dinged my first mirror a few weeks ago in Hammy Harbour, they definitely look & feel a bit weird.  Atleast I remembered the camera  "
243468,ccmtcanada,2008-08-26 11:26:00,7971,That's the way it always works DSN!  Congrats on catching it....I'm still looking for my first one.
243472,Victor,2008-08-26 11:55:00,1609,i'm still waiting for my first dsn .... congrats!
244614,sk_usagi,2008-08-29 18:32:00,10,"I caught my first (and only) mirror last year in July from a creek in St. Cats. At the time i didn't know what a mirror carp was... i thought it was a regular carp and that there was something wrong with it, looked like its scales were coming off. After looking into it i was releived to find out that it was a type of carp and not some funky desease  Love the colour on them, very pretty... well, now that i know it wasn't sick  -usagi  "
244630,Victor,2008-08-29 19:07:00,1609,wow that's a beauty of a mirror carp usagi! Amazing colors! Congrats on the catch!
244632,Marko,2008-08-29 19:13:00,854,"I catch about one a every 2 years Not very big but i caught a few. I`ve seen a huge one swimming around but would not bite. I love the way the mirrors look, much better looking then your standard carp, if you can say that haha."
244654,addict,2008-08-29 20:36:00,475, that is one ugly mutha .
244759,steelhead hunter,2008-08-30 01:18:00,152,nice fish but uuugly i'll take a rainbow any day
244777,hammercarp,2008-08-30 01:33:00,964,"Nice mirror Usagi, really great colours. My favourites are the fully scaled mirrors of which I have only caught one. They remind me of someone in bronze armour."
244811,MJL,2008-08-30 02:26:00,2427,"Congrats on the catch...I'm surprised you didn't have the camera...In all the times we fished together, you were my net and camera guy  I remember my first mirror carp.  It was a fully scaled mirror, black in colour and each scale had a silver lining to it.  Like DSN, I didn't have the camera.  I usually get 1 every couple of years.  Before the carp die-off in the Kawarthas, my dad used to get at least 1 per year there.  A few mirrors that I managed to take pics of  From earlier this year   From a couple years ago     From a time before I owned a digi-cam...Scanned this one   A baby mirror - about the size of a Kleenex box.  Caught lots of mirrors around this size. "
244819,CLofchik,2008-08-30 02:38:00,854,"Mirrors are fine & dandy, but how many people have caught a ZOMBIE CARP!  "
244825,douG,2008-08-30 02:58:00,2693,Well!
244828,sk_usagi,2008-08-30 03:09:00,10,Eeeww... the poor thing. It wasn't alive when you reeled it in was it? Or was it snagged?
244832,hammercarp,2008-08-30 03:54:00,964,Here's a spunky little one.  
244833,Victor,2008-08-30 04:01:00,1609, that's gotta be the 1st and probably only one i will ever see!! that's sick lol!  p.s. i see that you've switched from breadballs to corn/maize now !
244882,modny,2008-08-30 14:21:00,502,"if i caught a carp, i would cut my line. i wouldn't even touch it."
244923,sk_usagi,2008-08-30 18:08:00,10," Aaww... that's a cute one, nice fins on him... looks like he posing them for the picture"
244936,StrealHeader,2008-08-30 18:43:00,56, 
245002,hammercarp,2008-08-30 23:21:00,964, There is a little trick I use to get them to pose like that.
