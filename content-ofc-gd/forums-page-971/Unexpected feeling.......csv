All along the way, I kept getting the familiar feeling of knowing someone in the area. I travelled the 401 corridor and it was sort of odd, I felt that if something went wrong, one of the OFC family may happen along and give me a hand. Comforting to know, sort of. I've not always been the most favoured poster, don't get fishing much and off topic stuff gets me in trouble, along with a few brew. Thanks OFC!  BB"
