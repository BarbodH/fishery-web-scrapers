I believe it can get as deep as 90 feet in parts. Jigging spoons or trolling em?, live bait? trolling depths? structure? Anything would help, and hopefully i'll have some pics to share! Thanks in advance. "

A lot of guys troll with dispey divers (although I prefer the ""deeper divers"" made by walker downriggers)."
