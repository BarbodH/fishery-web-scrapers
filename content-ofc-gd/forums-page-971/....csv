In a nutshell, there's really only two fish in the great lakes that will have large black defined spots on the gill plates, brown trout & atlantic salmon.  If it DOESN'T have the large spots on the gill plates it's not a brown or an atlantic.  If the tail is forked, it's an atlantic, if it's squared off it's a brown trout.  Brown:     Atlantic:  "

Like Master Of Bait's fish, one look at the tail and it's pretty obvious:    Beats counting pyloric caecae, and it's easier to do C&R   Heh, should start a post with nothing but tails and see how everybody does"

Seems like whenever someone sees a silver brown its OMG you caught an atlantic. Well, no I didnt. I caught a brown.  I was pretty skeptical about this latest atlantic that was caught, I was thinking it was just a brown but in comparison to my brown it is pretty clear that it is atlantic. "
