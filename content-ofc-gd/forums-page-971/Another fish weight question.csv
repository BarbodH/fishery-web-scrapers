245441,Roy,2008-09-01 17:02:00,13728,I'm no bass expert but  It'd certainly be over 5 lbs. Probably closer to 5.75.
245443,steverowbotham,2008-09-01 17:07:00,1800,I would think over 5
245444,MCTFisher9120,2008-09-01 17:08:00,3761,5.2lbs.
245473,bassjnkie,2008-09-01 17:52:00,1101,Definitively over 5

245627,BabyHerc,2008-09-01 23:19:00,285,"Thanks, I've never caught smallies over about 2 lbs, and this one was heavy.  I was guessing over 4 for sure, maybe 4.5.  Pics coming soon..."
