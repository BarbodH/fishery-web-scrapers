229063,lunkerbasshunter,2008-07-17 20:06:00,2585,great report.  mild temps meaning like 95? lol  cheers!
229067,John,2008-07-17 20:09:00,2956,So the nudity starts promptly at noon?  Great report as usual Glen....you on a diet?
229078,Reef Runner,2008-07-17 20:24:00,980,Nice report GCD!  A mess 'o fish you got yerself!  Amazing they were biting in that soup.  Good job.
229088,Roy,2008-07-17 20:45:00,13728,Great report Glen! Looks like a busy morning with the fish. Nice to have the lake to yourself also. I noticed in the cat pics that you're holding them in your BARE hands. That's not very prudent is it?  Some members here hold them with a Boga or even welder's mitts because of the possibility of sustaining a lethal injection of fish slime. I guess you must be used to holding them. Or maybe the blue catfish don't have shooting darts or death rays for eyes or those 32 volt whiskers??

When I first started reading and I saw you were wearing your shirt, I thought that it couldn't be that cold down there, since we are roasting in 90F heat up here.  Then the later pictures showed the Glen we all know....LOL.  Very interesting seeing the water temps rise like that during the day....it was almost a steam bath in that last pic there!  Oh yeah...nice fish...that catfish looking at the date was hilarious!!!"
