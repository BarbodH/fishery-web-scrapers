229639,HIMTI,2008-07-18 21:45:00,33,Hi All.... I just got a boat and this will be the first time i will be going in water on a boat. I have been shore fishing for a while but never on a boat. Can someone advise me a good location to go around GTA. I dont want to go far on the first few trips.  Thanks in advance.  HIMTI
229640,modny,2008-07-18 21:48:00,502,what kinda boat?  i dont recomend a dinghy on eerie in heavy SW winds
229643,Smokey,2008-07-18 21:51:00,1278,Rice lake has been producing well this year. Only a little over an hour away.  Mike
229647,HIMTI,2008-07-18 21:58:00,33,16' bass boat. One of my friend said that area around Ontario place is good but he was not sure of i would need a Harbor License for this. Fishing derby for Salmon is also on in Lake Ontario...... Do you think that this boat is OK to go in there?
229648,workwear,2008-07-18 22:00:00,592,yes a harbour licence is needed......   always could try simcoe......fish cooks bay.....nice and close......   good luck and congrads
229694,lunkerbasshunter,2008-07-18 23:31:00,2585,i would say try cooks bay on simcoe its a bit more protected then the main lake and if its calm you can head out for some monster smallies.  Congrats of the new boat!  Cheers!
