229544,Zubris21,2008-07-18 18:29:00,563,"I just finished my Second university degree.  I had OSAP during both of my bouts at school and wouldn't have been able to pay for school/rent/food without the loans.   The nice thing about OSAP is you don't start accumulating interest until 8 months after you graduate(or maybe its 10 can't remember right now).  So you have time to get a decent paying job.  This is much better than a bank loan or line of credit where you pay interest immediately, and the interest rate through OSAP isn't too bad either  I would say get right into school when you're done HS.  Like others have said, once your out of school for a bit, its really hard to make yourself go back.  I think trades would be excellent if thats your kind of work, there certainly will be a demand, and the knowledge you gain is extremely functional.  Just make sure you get into something that will produce a job for you.  Try to get a program that has a co-op or placement to build some connections in the industry.  If you go the Academic route stay towards the sciences instead of arts.  There are just way too many students in the arts programs and its hard to stand out.  Besides your job opportunities are pretty limited by a general arts degree.  Teaching is a pretty good route (thats what I've done) but the job market is pretty competitive right now if you're not willing to relocate.  If you're willing to go north, you can almost pick where you want to go.  Others have mentioned the military, this is also a great choice, one that I strongly considered myself.  Its a great life experiences, and you are provided with a chance to see all over the world, and learn a great deal of information.  No matter what you choose I wish you the best.  Its a big decision, so don't take it lightly!"

229556,mepps,2008-07-18 18:51:00,1301,"I went to a private callage for network administration and most of the tiem I wish I hadnt! First off it was expensive, secondly, I didnt learn much and didnt get a job in the field. I really shoudlnt complain about my education though, it has landed me some great (unrelated) jobs  and the opportunity to travel.  Be weary of private collages if you are gona get into tech.  If I were to do it all again I'd choose something more fun and creative.   My advice is think long and hard about your future, not just the imediate future, but long term. Make sure whatever you choose to do, you really enjoy!"
229569,timmeh,2008-07-18 19:17:00,609,"I'm just finishing up a masters degree in aquatic biology so I've spent a few years in school. A lot of people talk about what you will and won't learn in the classroom at university, college or wherever. But you also learn a lot of other very important skills while in school especially if you're just leaving high school. First off living away from home is a great experience if you learn to manage your time and money properly and generally learn to be a little more responsible if you're smart. You probably didn't need to think about that at all in high school. Wherever you go to school they'll , likely have programs that help you learn to write resumes, how to handle yourself in job interviews etc. You'll get a lot more out of school that simply what you do in the classroom. Not to mention all the good times.  Going to school also gives you a lot of freedom to spend time doing things you enjoy.  You're only young once, so enjoy it. This can be very useful in helping figure out what you want to do. I know everyone tells you do something you like but if you're like me and a lot of young people you're not exactly sure what you'd like to do right out of high school.  But finally don't let other people tell you what you'd like to do because they can't answer that question for you. Don't sign up for something just because you think you can make good money doing it. And don't worry if you're not completely sure about you're future right now, you have plenty of time to figure it out."
229624,Pachone,2008-07-18 21:00:00,276,"Mikey,  I going through the same process. Im 21, and i went to cooking school after highschool because i was told ""do what u like"" so i liekd food and to eat.....but i DONT want to do it as a career. SO now i work in some office and dont really like it. What i would suggest is find a program in college that u find interesting whatever it is, and take it. Because either way u NEED the education... so go to school. If u really want a trade do it. Apprentice or something."
229630,Gerritt,2008-07-18 21:10:00,6129,"I worked fulltime in highschool, I worked fulltime while going to University... I needed too. I had rent and bills to pay on top of that I also had to pay for my tuition..  It can be done.. just be prepared to work hard.. and in the end you have no debt looming over you're head for years to come.    I will suggest as others have.. Pick up a trade.  G"
229797,Tinman,2008-07-19 03:46:00,376,"Look at trades in the military, i am a gas fitter/ tinbanger. i looked into the military as a career before i became a tradesman. They turned me down flatly because of my allergies. now they are offering a start as a corporal pay and a signing bonus. I tell them no now. i was in sales most of my adult life and switched when i got laid off, been in the trade 2 years now and never would look back! Best of luck to you"
229425,fishinggeek,2008-07-18 13:28:00,325,"Lots of good stuff here, and I thought I'd add my 2 cents.  Considering going in straight after high school and working part-time to fund it.  Your education is an investment, and you only have a fixed number of years you can work, so the earlier you get it done, the more return on it you can potentially make (assuming you're ready for college which it sounds like you are).  Regarding student loans, if you need them, they're a good thing.  They help people go to school that would not have gone otherwise, so that can't be bad.  Remember that the interest on OSAP has a tax shield, so you are effectively paying less than the interest rate by paying a bit less in income taxes (depending on your tax bracket), so the payments should hurt your wallet less.  I wouldn't be scared of the OSAP interest if what you plan to study generates additional income for you after you graduate, which is usually does.  A lot of people seem pretty passionate on what occupation to do, such as trades, military, etc.  Certainly these are honest, hard-working careers, and considering Canada's shortage in trades, you can make a very decent living.  But no one knows you better than youself, so only you can really chose your own career path.  People have tried to steer me into certain careers when I was younger too, and thank goodness I choose my own career path based on my preferences.  Narrow your search into things you like to do, then see if they can give you a comfortable living.  That is precisely what I did against the advice of some friends and family members, and now I have a very fulfilling career that provides me and my family a very comfortable living, likely far better than I would have done if I listened to others' advice.  Also remember that now people tend to have many jobs, often in multiple industries, throughout one's life.  This is quite different than previous generations where one would work in the same company/industry until retirement.  So you're not ""sentencing"" yourself to a career path by going to college.  You can still learn a trade, join the military, go back to school, or whatever after your program."
229455,tbayboy,2008-07-18 14:03:00,1497,Here's my 2 cents:  1. Don't go straight into university without a plan.  Don't go simply because 'its what people do'.  ESPECIALLY if you're going to have to borrow to do it.  Not to make fun of some degrees but you probably don't have the option to switch plans every year - I have friends who I think are still bartending at U Waterloo and have 5 arts degrees under their belt.  If your not sure what you want then look around first.  2. Don't ignore trades and college - as pointed out many times above.  University certainly isn't the be all end all the high schools seem to make it out to be (that said I'm very happy I did the university route but it was a very focused one)  4. Co-op/internship - your nuts not to look for these.  First off they help pay: for 5 years at UW (yeah I needed extra term - who can study in the summers?) I borrowed 2 grand from my parents and got a 500 osap loan in the 4th year which I blew on beer - the rest came from my co-op placements.  And more importantly you're really set for life with what you learn in the co-op terms.  Not knocking the studies but the real world isn't a classroom.  Now enjoy your file year of high school.

229536,Canuck2fan,2008-07-18 18:09:00,1444,It really depends on what YOU see as your future. The trades are certainly booming all of them and EVERYTHING is paid all the way along except for your beer money while in class.  I find too many people going to university has watered down the benefits. I have worked with literally hundreds of students during summers who are just looking for a paycheck over the years and frankly the ones that go to university just because mom said I have to have not found that spending the money needed has paid off for them. Most of them are just doing exactly what they would have been doing right of high school but they do have a graduation picture and a sheepskin and still asking do you want fries with that.  That being said the ones who went to university because they WANTED what a program offered them are usually very successful and doing quite well financially and quality of life wise.  I find my friends who went through the trades are doing very well financially too. Many of them opened their own businesses and their biggest concern right now is what work to take what work to refuse while still being able to be on their boat or at their cottages 3 or 4 days a week all summer long.  The long and short of it is either route will only give you what you want to put into it. So choose something you can see yourself being happy with. There isn't a form of education that WILL NOT benefit you in the long run. Knowledge of any kind is always the most POWERFUL tool in any field or economic situation.
