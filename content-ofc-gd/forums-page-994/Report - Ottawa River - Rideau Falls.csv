The plan was for me and couple of friends Paul & Kevin to go to the Rideau Falls and target the walleys...  The weather was nice and off we go at 5:30pm.... Got the boat launched at 5:45pm and fishing within minutes...  Did not take long, Paul hooks into a small eye   Then it's my turn...... a cat   Then it's Kevin's turn with another cat   The bitting was on and just could'nt believe catching so many fish on the Ottawa on a full moon Here is the rest of the fish we caught:                     And last but not least..... the biggest walley of the night.... 19"" caught on a 1/4 oz jig, rigged with Gulp Alive 3"" minnow grub chartreuse and live leech    All fish were released and total fish caught tonight was 7 eyes, 6 drums, unlimited rock bass and cats. Sure was a very good night to be out on the river  Until next time Leechman"
