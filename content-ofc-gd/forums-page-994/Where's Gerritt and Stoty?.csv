229288,Mike the Pike,2008-07-18 03:20:00,3421,Don't worry I am sure Gerritt is on vacation and teaching young Liam how to fish.  Stoty was part of the Hockey Draft he is now the Towel boy  Detroit Lover  Stoty we need some new bass pics
229305,Musky or Specks,2008-07-18 03:40:00,2710,I seem to remember Stoty was undergoing some personal problems he might not have the time or this board might not be a priority right now.
229306,muskymike,2008-07-18 03:42:00,772,Thats what I was thinking. I hope it all ends up positive for him.
229334,Angler16,2008-07-18 08:06:00,188,Hope hes alright i saw a post from him i think just not too long ago
229344,steve_paul,2008-07-18 10:53:00,658,I think Stoty is away fishing this week up near Kingston with his buddy.

229353,Rich,2008-07-18 11:09:00,3927,"Could've sworn I just saw a post by Stoty yesterday.. on the other hand, when it comes to OFC that is a long time! lol"
229360,Marko,2008-07-18 11:19:00,854,"Last i saw from Stoty, he was asking about some lake North of Kingston, I think, I know he was asking about some lake where he was supposed to go fish with his buddy. Gerrit, I am not sure."
229361,Greencoachdog,2008-07-18 11:22:00,8163,Gerritt and Stoty disappear at the same time... am I the only one that smells a Honeymoon???
