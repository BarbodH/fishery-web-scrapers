229299,jediangler,2008-07-18 03:34:00,1923,I'm going up to Pigeon with the family this Saturday for a week of fun and fishing. My daughter wants to know how cold the water will be at the beach. She checked her Grandma's pool today and it was 79F. Just wondering what temp readings you guys have observed recently. Thanks.
