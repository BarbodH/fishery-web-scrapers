228848,Roy,2008-07-17 12:18:00,13728,"Hey Clive, do you want it here or should I PM you about the spelling mistake in your tat?"
228911,mepps,2008-07-17 14:28:00,1301, Are you reffering to my other tattoo   or my gone fish'n'
228980,mkeyes,2008-07-17 17:23:00,26,"Great Tat!!!!  I should get hubby one that says... Goin' Fishin' across his back, so I know where he is off to without asking lol  I had wanted this one but wow now that I have seen this one hmmmm real nice "

The tattoo on your abdomen besides looking painful...makes me wonder 'why'...again to each their own...I prefer more creativity and artwork...letters are just letters."

229517,cityfisher,2008-07-18 17:36:00,959, 2nd that... Got my TAT there some 7 years ago.. Still looks great and they did a great job.
228338,mepps,2008-07-16 11:05:00,1301,"I've had this tattoo planned for a few years now, and my wonderful fiance offered to pay a big chunk of it as an early birthday present this year.  I think these two words sum me up pretty well, you'll probably see the same to words on my grave stone.     "
228339,modny,2008-07-16 11:09:00,502,ahahahah   SWEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEET  that black work looks great!

228391,Pachone,2008-07-16 13:30:00,276,That is one sick tatoo!  Congrats bud!
228395,Billy - Curtiss,2008-07-16 13:38:00,241,"Rad!! Yeah, the stomach is one of the most painful places to get tattooed."
228402,addy79,2008-07-16 13:50:00,573,nice....  
228416,1leggedangler,2008-07-16 14:25:00,364,"Love the font style, very cool!!!  Cheers, 1leg"
228418,Roy,2008-07-16 14:31:00,13728,"So Clive...when's the McDonald's logo going up?  Don't take your shirt off at a golf course, you'll confuse all the blondes."
228420,The Urban Fisherman,2008-07-16 14:43:00,2050,"Nice Tat Mepps - I always wanted to get one that had to do with fishing but couldn't come up with anything creative enough.......I think I've been over thinking it.  I like it!  Cheers, UF"

228445,highdrifter,2008-07-16 15:37:00,2534,OUCH!!  Dedication is sometimes painful... I guess..  Very noice brotha.  HD
228449,mepps,2008-07-16 15:48:00,1301,Roy: I'll get that McD's tattoo as soon as tehy give me a check for a million bucks!
228450,Reef Runner,2008-07-16 15:48:00,980,sweet tat!
228469,Whopper,2008-07-16 16:35:00,2174,Glad this story wasn't about losing a digit.... I still haven't gotten over that fiasco
228477,LeXXington,2008-07-16 16:50:00,1928,Ouch.. but way cool
228486,jdmls,2008-07-16 17:16:00,575,Awesome font.......what shop did you go to ?
228513,mepps,2008-07-16 18:20:00,1301, I got it in Halifax at Sin On Skin.  Whopper: I've still got all my digits...for now!
228514,misfish,2008-07-16 18:29:00,29133,"Ok, I have been hum,n and huh,n for the last 10 years about getting a TAT. Not sure I want to go to that extream,but Im thinking what the hell. The only thing that scares me is infection(virus) clean needles.  Nice work though Clive."
228517,snag,2008-07-16 18:32:00,1932,"What?  You promised,  ""Property of SNAG""   You can still use your back, I guess."
228555,mepps,2008-07-16 20:00:00,1301," Most shops, expecially in Toronto are very clean, there are code they need to meet to stay open! One of the cleanest I've seen is Waycool Uptown in Toronto north of the 401. As long as you arnt getting a tattoo from your neighbors cusins nephew in his basement apartment, you shouldnt worry abotu dirty needles.  I've be WAY more concerned about getting a piercing at a place like Shoppers Drugmart (or anywhere they use those piercing gunds - they cant be sterilized!!!!!!!)   Thats EXACTLY what I'm saving my back for!"
228560,Mike01,2008-07-16 20:09:00,378,Looks fantastic Clive!!
