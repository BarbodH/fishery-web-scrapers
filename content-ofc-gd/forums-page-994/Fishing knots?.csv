229386,Angler16,2008-07-18 12:04:00,188,What knot would you guys say is the strongest and easy to tie? Im doing this knot where you make a loop and then wrap around the loop six times sorry if this doesn't make any sense but ye its a good knot but i was wondering if there are any better suggestions? Thanks -Little Angler

229394,richyb,2008-07-18 12:12:00,774,Here is a site with different knots used while fishing ...  http://www.animatedknots.com/indexfishing.php  I like the palomar knot.

229409,e-z-out,2008-07-18 12:59:00,1052, hands down the best knot
229418,Reef Runner,2008-07-18 13:14:00,980,Palomar
229420,fishinggeek,2008-07-18 13:16:00,325,"Anybody every try the Bucher power knot?  It looks like an improved palomar knot.  Though it's a bit more difficult to tie, maybe it's better.  I haven't used it yet but it's on my ""to do"" list."
229422,Leecher,2008-07-18 13:26:00,7832,I use the uni knot and find it very strong..... Here is a link to an animated knot site  http://www.animatedknots.com/uniknot/index...imatedknots.com  Leechman
229432,douG,2008-07-18 13:37:00,2693,"Great instructional video, Roy.  That pretty much explains it all."
229435,anders,2008-07-18 13:39:00,1168,"Im a big fan of the trilene knot.  Use it all the time except if i am making my own spinner rigs, or salmon flies.  I am going to try the rapala knot though...i like that idea"
229436,muskymike,2008-07-18 13:40:00,772,Another for the Palomar.
229442,modny,2008-07-18 13:45:00,502,i've been using the clinch knot since i can remember..  gonna try using that palomar knot for a lil while though
229444,chickenhawk,2008-07-18 13:47:00,612,Palamar is the way to go.....really strong knot and easy to learn
229483,bpsbassman,2008-07-18 15:16:00,941,Polomar all the way!!!
229484,eagsfan93,2008-07-18 15:22:00,15,"I just started using the trilene knot this year, and it took me 5 minutes to learn and has not broken yet."
229485,BillM,2008-07-18 15:22:00,17367,"I like the Trilene knot for mono, palomar for braid."
229488,bbog,2008-07-18 15:26:00,665,Palomar is easy to tie and maintains strength at the knot - what else do you need?
229492,MCTFisher9120,2008-07-18 15:41:00,3761," ahahahaha, thats my fav now ."
229494,Raf,2008-07-18 15:42:00,3495,"without out a shadow of a doubt the pal........... uni knot, most versatile knot out there."
229523,Burning Babies,2008-07-18 17:54:00,150,"The Palomar comes out as the strongest out there, based on every test I've seen, but personally, I find it a PITA to tie.  I've been using the Trilene knot for years, and stick to it most of the time."
229529,sunfish,2008-07-18 17:59:00,57,"Palomar, uni..trilene are all great knots.  I find that the Polamar is the easiest to tie.  Uni to Uni is great to know for leaders..."
229533,ccmtcanada,2008-07-18 18:01:00,7971,"Anything with a leader I like to snell my hooks.  Mono, I like the improved cinch knot and with braided line I go to the polymar knot."
