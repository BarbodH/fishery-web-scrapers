Although the system is great (according to LUND) I find it hard to fit anything that works fine there. Does anyone know what mounts/adapters might work with that unique rail system? Thanks in advance,"
229282,nel,2008-07-18 03:09:00,52,"I think you need to mount the rod holders onto the brackets, and then the brackets go into the rail system.  http://www.hennepinmarine.biz/lund-sporttr...et--angled.html http://www.hennepinmarine.biz/lund-sporttr...cket--flat.html"

229322,audio_mad,2008-07-18 04:45:00,28,That's exactly what I needed - a sporttrak bracket. Could not find it - hope the links you gave will help. Thanks a lot!
229340,Alumacraft,2008-07-18 10:00:00,139,just a word of caution do not trust those lund rails and rod holders for grinding bottom with big musky baits my buddy has broken 2 of them.
