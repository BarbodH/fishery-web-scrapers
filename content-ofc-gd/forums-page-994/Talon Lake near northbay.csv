229162,steelheader42,2008-07-17 23:38:00,44,Just wondering if anyone has ever fished Talon Lake before? Heading up there in Aug is it good smallie fishing there an hows the Muskie fishing? Was there in May walleye fishing but it was still really cold.....

I go in spring when everything else is closed.  Talked  to a Bud who lives on Talon and is doing good right now for everything that swims...this is not the case for everyone  though.....  fish pops usually tend to move around as the seasons change who knows how it'll be in August.. If this rain don't stop who knows where they'll be....  I struggling right now on my usual spots.  Good Luck in August  !!  :Gonefishing:  Randy"
