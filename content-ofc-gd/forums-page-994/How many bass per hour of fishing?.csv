229132,Terry,2008-07-17 22:11:00,14456,I don't know   but look at almost any bass tourney here or US and see how many entries get skunked of less then their limit  or 10 one day and none the next and these are guys who fish for bass every day  they would kill for the fish that many seem to be catching here
229133,oncogene,2008-07-17 22:12:00,154," The thing is tho, there really isn't any more water for me to cover in my usual fishing spot heh ... ok and I'm lazy to walk too much. It's just about 80m & 50m long of boat docks and the canal locks. To be honest I still haven't caught a single fish with any hard-bait yet in my life! (ok i only been fishing for 2-3 years) All these spinners, spinnerbait, crankbait, buzzbaits, spoons etc sitting in my tackle box... never caught a fish  Maybe I should try other lakes/spots.... lota lakes here around Kingston... but perhaps too many lol. Tried to ask ppl where else is good but didn't get any much info really. I did try 2-3 other lakes, but didn't really produce more than my usual spot. And perhaps a blessing and also a curse.... my usual spot is like 5min from where I live. It's hard to convince myself to drive 1/2 hr+ to other lakes which may or maynot produce, esp with these gas prices, when there's known spot 5min away  Woh, if those numbers are actually, then it does seem low. Esp considering how alot of ppl here reporting tens/dozens of bass in a trip/day.  Or maybe the ppl here are just that good lol   If I only counted fish over 20""..... I'd have to change this thread's title to "" how many fish u get PER YEAR"" lol"
229151,jwl,2008-07-17 23:04:00,1056,"all depends on where you are fishing for sure...some areas are ""infested"" with bass,there are places I have fished from shore on the Niagara River where catching 50-60 bass from sun up until about 10am is pretty common..but after a few days of fishing a couple areas, you come to realize that you are catching many of the same fish over again.   I have also spent days at my camp where we catch 30-40 bass of all different sizes within a few hours...sometimes every cast in both of these scenarios.    A couple years ago bass opener me and 2 other guys boated 68 for the morning...I know these number may seem far fetched for some, but it does happen...other days depending on boat traffic, weather ect you may have to work half the day to maybe land 12-15 fish.  It's pretty cool when you are fighting a decent smallie for example and you see 20-30 of them following around the one you have hooked...then you know it's going to be a good day  sure fire way for me to not catch bass is.....enter a bass tourney  , I could fish the day before and the day after in the exact same spots and catch tonnes...tourney day...maybe a couple little ones if I am lucky"
229167,steelheader42,2008-07-17 23:50:00,44,I remember the day when you use to go down to the Thames river in London catch 40 or 50 smallies a day not anymore if your lucky to catch 10 or 15 a day  thats a good day...
229324,Burning Babies,2008-07-18 05:58:00,150," Those are ODW data compiled from hundreds of angler interviews.  We have plenty of fish here, but they see a lot of lures, and probably have more prey resources available than yours do.  We've got about 1.6 million anglers fishing around 150 reservoirs (averaging maybe 1000 acres) and a bunch of ponds.  It's a different ballgame down here."
228721,Bassaholic,2008-07-17 01:49:00,74,"I think the ratio really comes down to the water you're fishing. Especially if you're fishing from shore like you said you were. But one thing I'll suggest you try to do is cover more water and fish something alittle faster than a senko...at least to start. Next time maybe start off with a spinnerbait or a crankbait. If you're fishing in the morning or evening try a buzzbait. Work a section of the shore with a reaction type bait and target the aggressive fish first. But let the fish tell you what they want. If you have no takers and the fish dont seem active then go back to where you started and re-work that area with a senko or a jig. This is exactly what I did tonight. Started with a buzz but they didn't want it so I switched to a jig and they started hammering it. Caught 1 in 30 mins throwing the buzz and then 10 in an hour using the jig. They were mostly dinks, biggest was maybe 2lbs. But 2 weeks ago I fished the same area with a buzzbait and didn't have to switch because they were aggressive and I caught probably 20 in 2 hours."
228723,woodee148,2008-07-17 02:02:00,14,"  we were docked in westport (upper rideau) The kids and I were fishing off the dock into the pads and shallows, we landed three decent basss in the 1.5 hours we fished.  while we were fishing a couple of guys pulled in on there bass boat (stumped it before they let the electric down) they were landing fish so fast that we didn't even dorp our lines in while they were there.  We just watched in awe as these caught and released at least 20 fish in the 1/2 our they were there.  it was a bit discouraging but it was great entertainment to see the pros at work!!"
229093,Burning Babies,2008-07-17 20:59:00,150,"I think the catch rate in Ontario is higher than we have down here, largely due to the angling pressure on our lakes.  I compiled some stats from our 2005 creel data (10 lakes) to compare.  Best Lake – 1.4 bass / hour  2nd best – .9 bass / hour  Avg for good lakes – about .7  Overall average – around .5 bass / hour.  I've been fishing one of the ""good"" lakes this year, and probably average .75 to 1 bass / hour."
229101,CLofchik,2008-07-17 21:16:00,854," What he said.  The only time I target bass is taking a canoe into back lakes, and then I only count the fish over 20"".  1 or 2 a day is a good outing.  Ofcourse somebody swiped my canoe and I've gone out twice after bass around Hamilton from shore.  Late spring, they're still guarding fry in the shallows, skunked both times.   Having a small boat increases your odds exponentially, even just around your shore spots."
229103,Greencoachdog,2008-07-17 21:20:00,8163,Today for me it was 5 Bass in the boat in an hour and 10 minutes... then the bite stopped.  With the biggest breaking me off and 3 dinks I didn't count.
229126,grt1,2008-07-17 22:06:00,638,"I found the responses interesting because I don't fish bass (the line for bass in lakes is south of here about 75 miles) so Iwas wondering what makes it so popular for most of the guys on this site.  When I was a kid growing up in Brantford, I would go to the Grand River at the end of my street and fish from the bank for hours and usually end up getting 2 or 3. I always thought that was good.  However, when I moved north, I hadn't fished for years and when I got back into it everything up here was walleye. Although I was living on Lake of the woods, the emphasis was walleye, then over the course of the past 20 years the swing has gone to bass in that area. A buddy of mine owns a sporting good shop in Sioux Narrows and he told me that in the 1970s he sold 95% of his stock for walleye, now he sells that percentage of stock for bass.  As to what is good fish rate per hour. I can only talk walleye, Here in the Red Lake area, a good day is usually 80 to 100 per day.  last sunday the wife and I went out for 2 hours and caught over 40 walleye. Today I was out for 2 hours and had to work to get 10."
