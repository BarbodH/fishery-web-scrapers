229223,motv8tr,2008-07-18 01:55:00,2587,"Hey all, I want to get a trolling motor for my boat, and thought my only option was a transom mount.  It has been suggested that I could actually put a bow mount on my boat.  The thing I like about the bow mount is that they have foot controls.  I have only found one transom mount with the foot control and it was pretty much double the cost   Why don't more have the foot pedals?  The main use for the motor will be to control the direction while drifting and to stay in basically the same area without havint to constantly start up the big motor and move.... I'm not one for trolling much.  Also, if I can and do get a bow mount are they easy to remove when fishing is done for the day?  The boat is docked at Beans and I don't know that I'd want to leave it on the boat there..or even in my driveway.  I thought I had a picture of the font of my boat but I was wrong  Thanks Maureen"
229235,Nanook,2008-07-18 02:16:00,565,"Hi Moe; Does your boat have any kind of deck? If so make sure the cables are long enough to reach the floor.Definately go for the Bow mount as they will give you more control. They all come with a soet of quick release, so they do come off easily. You'll get more answers with more expertise I'm sure, Size, shaft length, etc.But Minn Kota all the way. All the best"
229247,ccmtcanada,2008-07-18 02:26:00,7971,"Hey Maureen!  I used a transom mount on our 14 footer and while it worked ok, it was a pain in the butt to use as the driver (me) had to constantly control the tiller.  While a foot control would have been sweet, I find that the bowmount offers MUCH more control.  When it's pulling the boat, the steering is much more responsive than when it has to push the whole boat."
229250,Greencoachdog,2008-07-18 02:28:00,8163,Bow mount wouldn't be good for your boat Mo... too difficult to deploy and retract!  
229256,ccmtcanada,2008-07-18 02:34:00,7971,"Yep...just looked back at your pics...you'd have to remove the windscreen to get reasonably good access to it.  For some reason I thought it had an open bow...not sure why I thought that because Bly and I almost bought that boat...LOL.  Even with the windscreen gone, you'd have to kneel up on that deck to deploy it.  Oh sure Glen...now you post the pic after I went back and searched for other posts with pics in it...LOL."
229343,motv8tr,2008-07-18 10:51:00,2587,"Not sure I have to remove the windshield, I figure if I got one with a long shaft and long cables I could do it no?  I guess the deployment might be difficult though now that you mention it.  Does anyone know why transom mounts don't commonly come with foot pedal?  Maureen"
229348,Roy,2008-07-18 11:05:00,13728,"Maureen, for your needs, you'd probably be better off with an engine mount.  http://www.minnkotamotors.com/products/mot...tail.asp?pg=fem"
229352,Greencoachdog,2008-07-18 11:08:00,8163, ... because as you mentioned earlier... it adds mucho $$$ to the price!
229357,Greencoachdog,2008-07-18 11:14:00,8163,"  Yeah, but those dang things are expensive too!!!  http://www.basspro.com/webapp/wcs/stores/s...0002000_200-2-1  I personally can't see their value at that price..."
229363,motv8tr,2008-07-18 11:25:00,2587,"Glen beat me to it, there's no way I can afford that, but it looks about the perfect solution   I saw a transom mount 55lb thrust with a foot pedal for 384...where else can I look other than Bass pro?  I prefer a store over online shopping.  Maureen"
229367,Terry,2008-07-18 11:32:00,14456,if you want to keep the price down I wee no reason why you couldn't buy a used bow mount Electric Steer Foot Pedal type and mount it on one side off the back of the boat when not in use in would sit along the side of the boat but it would work
229388,Greencoachdog,2008-07-18 12:07:00,8163,"Terry, the controll cable that goes from the foot pedal to the head of a bow mount wouldn't be long enough to reach the deck when deployed in that manner and is another reason a bow mount wouldn't work for you on the front of your boat Mo.  I believe the pedal controll transom mount would be your best bet Mo."
229426,Beans,2008-07-18 13:30:00,3339,Get rid of the windshield and half the dashboard and the cover over the bow...install a casting deck and pedastal seat...then install a bow mount trolling motor and a single windshield  Takes lots of dinero I know but save your pennies and someday...or trade up later for a boat with all the goodies you want...  Rome wasn't built in a day don't you know...
229428,BillM,2008-07-18 13:34:00,17367,"For boat control, nothing beats a bowmount.   But I think you are pretty limited to a transom mount on your boat."
229440,Terry,2008-07-18 13:42:00,14456,"  that is why I stated Electric Steer Foot Pedal, it's wires not cable. my wire was more then long enough, but I was suggesting she mounts a bow mount motor at the back of the boat, with Electric Steer Foot Pedal like this    and has 18' cord     <a href=""http://s25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/?action=view&current=fix1.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/fix1.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a> <a href=""http://s25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/?action=view&current=fix-1.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/fix-1.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>  a picture is worth aahhh you know"
229452,motv8tr,2008-07-18 14:00:00,2587,"Terry, I had thought about doing something like that, but didn't think a bow mount would work at the back of the boat.  If it's doable that's the way I'd prefer to go....the bow mount is half the price  Maureen"
229458,Terry,2008-07-18 14:06:00,14456,as long as there is a place to put it  you bet it will work
229462,Greencoachdog,2008-07-18 14:11:00,8163,"Well if you're going to go that route Terry, why not go wireless??? http://www.cabelas.com/cabelas/en/template...602013&rid=  It's the same as yours without a wire to get your feet tangled up in, or knotted... or cut.  ... but realistically, I think the transom mount would give better boat control being mounted a little closer to the center of the transom."
229468,Terry,2008-07-18 14:25:00,14456,"for sure that is the one I have  but I was trying to save her as much money as possible..wireless is nice   and from the picture, not being a tiller boat, I didn't think there was room to steer a transom mount"
229512,Beans,2008-07-18 17:11:00,3339,"There is a special transom mount thingy on the other side of the big motor for mounting a ""kicker motor"" but the handle would need an extension...can't see any reason why a bow mount trolling motor couldn't be attached to it like Terry suggests with long wire to the control or wireless as mentioned...  I'm thinking of mounting my 4.5 hp Merc on there as a 'Kicker"" as long as her boat is here as a back-up...  Like I said to Big Cliff...""not sure if the 55 on the big motor stands for 55 hp or 1955""..."
