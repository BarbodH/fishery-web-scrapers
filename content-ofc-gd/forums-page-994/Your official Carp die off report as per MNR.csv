228727,Ron,2008-07-17 02:06:00,1683,"Here is a link to what the MNR have found to be the cause of the Carp die off in the Kawarthas and other surrounding lakes.  There was no mention of the MNR testing a new chemical, nor do they believe it was caused by aliens. You never know though, birds do fly from one lake to the next and with the Trent Severn Locks attaching all the infected lakes... maybe it has something to do with that...  http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/en/Business/LetsF...age/239472.html"
