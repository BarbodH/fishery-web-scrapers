229330,Angler16,2008-07-18 07:29:00,188,"Just so theres no confusion its little angler i have made a new account that has a - in front of my name because the site was not logging me in saying how i logged it wrong too many times and it would be restored in -88 minutes and all this stuff so i said scrap that and i made a new account .Plus i had kept using the automatic log in button that lets your computer remember your password so i just usually clicked that so the thing is i really actually forgot my password and i forgot the password to the email i registered under. So i will not be using the old one anymore,thats all i wanted to say so you guys wouldn't be confused or anything Cheers, L.A"
