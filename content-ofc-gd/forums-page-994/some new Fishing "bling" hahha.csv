227122,mkeyes,2008-07-13 20:34:00,26,Great job L.A. If only my kids kept their tackle box looking that nice!!
227128,purekgw,2008-07-13 20:50:00,585,i have some to they about $22 and they work excellent
229538,MCTFisher9120,2008-07-18 18:15:00,3761, I have only really used the leeches for rock bass and perch fishing dock side. For those species i find they work good. As for SM&LM bass i have not really used them yet. I am going to try a lot of drop shot rigs with these might even throw them on jig heads. I will try them this weekend and tell you how they work.  Mike
229563,Leecher,2008-07-18 19:01:00,7832,"Great job LA.... Your box is clean and organize.  When I was 13, I did not have a box, I used my fathers and eventually became mine because I was using it more than him.    I still have old lures that I carry in it but don't use anymore.... it's of sentimental value.  Again good job and I'm sure you'll find & buy more lures to add to your arsenal.  Leechman"
229568,Burning Babies,2008-07-18 19:16:00,150,"You guys both have excellent starts.   Might want to look into some toned-down patterns for clear water.  I'm not a Booyah fan, but something like this: "
225968,little angler,2008-07-10 22:48:00,128,Just cleaned out y'old tackle box pretty good for a 13 year old i think 
225993,dagoat_1,2008-07-10 23:53:00,72,Nice selection.....keep er growing!
225994,Sinker,2008-07-10 23:56:00,8692,Keep casting that yellow musky bucktail and you'll get one fer sure!! I love that one.....  Sinker
225999,oncogene,2008-07-11 00:06:00,154,"Nice... but where'r the senkos?   I've yet gotten any fish, not even a single bite, with any hard bait... arh"
226025,Zubris21,2008-07-11 01:21:00,563,I wish my tackle box looked like that at 13
226038,JohnF,2008-07-11 01:56:00,3494, I wish mine looked like that at 62.  JF

226101,tdotfisherman,2008-07-11 04:17:00,317,One lure that you have in your tackle box singlehandedly caught me 7 Northern Pike this past weekend up on Georgian Bay. I'll let you guess which one..
226110,motv8tr,2008-07-11 09:19:00,2587,"Nice selection LA, you may want to look into getting some plastics though for the Bass, they love Senko's and tubes  Maureen"
226124,Victor,2008-07-11 11:18:00,1609,"Nice stash you got there LA. When i was around your age, I bought 1-2 lures everytime I go fishing (usually drop by a tackle shop for worms).... and now i have a huge tackle bag full of'em .  You seem to like the yellow/chartuese theme alot! If you don't mind me making one suggestion, is that i'd say you can add a few more ""natural color-ed"" baits to your arsenal."
226175,The Urban Fisherman,2008-07-11 13:42:00,2050, LOL that's funny John!  Nice setup L.A. - Get yourself some soft plastics and you're all set!
226242,ccmtcanada,2008-07-11 15:12:00,7971,"When I was 13, my tackle box had a few red and white bobbers, about 3 hooks and a few pieces of lead shot.  And it stayed that way until I was 36....LOL."
226255,tjsa,2008-07-11 15:49:00,1578," :lol:  Not that long of a time period for me, but I didn't own a tackle box when I was 13.  I think I just shoved the spinners, hooks, sinkers, and.................YES!!!!!!  THE RED AND WHITE BOBBERS!!!"" in a few of the pockets of an old canvas backpack handed down to me from my dad."
226302,mepps,2008-07-11 17:35:00,1301,"Similar to my collection, just add 50 or so more spinner baits..."
226311,SlowPoke,2008-07-11 17:51:00,2984,Well done LA but no Red Devil?!?!?! It must be tough building a tackle stash these days - not only is everything $8+ but the options are rediculous! How do you just pick one? -Brian
226313,kemper,2008-07-11 18:00:00,2232,lookin good but....MORE SPINNERBAITS
226328,purekgw,2008-07-11 18:18:00,585,Nice man good start mine use to look like that then i started working and well made some upgrades  and box started to fill up  
226389,little angler,2008-07-11 19:54:00,128,"i have the yamamoto's and some yum and im buying some gulp live. And the spinner baits i have are up on stop you cant see them very well i have maybe 4 then another 8 my dad keeps those though. My dad and i both like to share lures a bond between a son and his dad,nothing like it!"
226397,Rich,2008-07-11 20:06:00,3927,Good start dude!  I have to admit when I was 13 I was lucky to have my grandfather and my dad donating lures they didn't use to me all the time. I don't think I've had just ONE tackle box since I was six..
226407,highdrifter,2008-07-11 20:27:00,2534,PPPFFFFFF.  You need only one bait in that box.. That firetiger HJ 13..  HD
226427,little angler,2008-07-11 20:56:00,128,
226453,Rich,2008-07-11 21:38:00,3927,Rock bass lure IMO
227102,MCTFisher9120,2008-07-13 19:45:00,3761,Thats a good box. But where is the soft plastics and the GULP!!!
227112,MCTFisher9120,2008-07-13 20:13:00,3761,"I don't want to take over your thread but i think my opponent should know what i am working with this summer. This just shows the difference of 3 years of getting fishing supplies.  Spinnerbaits  Gulp Alive  Soft Plastics1  Soft Plastics2  Gulp  Yum Scent  Hooks,weights etc...  Basic Tools  Lures1  Lures2 "
227121,little angler,2008-07-13 20:30:00,128,very nice all the yum and soft baits i have you cant see in the picture they are in the bottom portion of my box.how are the gulp leeches may i ask? and how much?
