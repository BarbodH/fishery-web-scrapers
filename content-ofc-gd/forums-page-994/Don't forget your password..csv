229122,Guest AILE GOBY 1,2008-07-17 21:59:00,0,Well had to make a new account since i can't get my old one back    having problems getting the password sent to my email address. I'm so use to having my password locked to the computer i forgot it since it's been almost a year since i had to use it to log on. Well if i don't get my old account back I'll use this one from now one i guess.
