I have seen some pics on here of guys with them on but it looks like the front seat is usually taken out or made into a platform.  Now I dont really wanna screw around and take out the front seat, so I think the Platform is the way to go if need be. I can fashion something up if i need.  As for my question, For those of you that have them or used to have them on a tinny, how exactly was it installed on the bow. I have 2 Lund WC 14's that are in pretty good condition still and would rather not mess with the bow piece (some screws are fine).  So I am calling out to all, can you guys post some pics and throw some ideas out?  Thanks all,  Mike"

229741,muskymike,2008-07-19 01:32:00,772,Thats exactly what I am looking for Cliff. Thanks. Thats perfect. I wonder if anyone else has done this now..  Yours looks great though. Do you notice the additional weight of the battery?
