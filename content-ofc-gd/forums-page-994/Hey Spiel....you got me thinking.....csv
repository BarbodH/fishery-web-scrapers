229547,ccmtcanada,2008-07-18 18:40:00,7971, ACK!!!!  Ok Ok Ok...maybe the the scene isn't quite how the picture shows.  I used a 5 foot rod and shakespeare reel on string with a paperclip for a hook.

229066,Greencoachdog,2008-07-17 20:07:00,8163,I've saved that pic... it'll come in handy at a later date I'm sure!!!
229082,Reef Runner,2008-07-17 20:27:00,980,Now that's hardcore!
229095,cranks bait,2008-07-17 21:04:00,721,"Geez Cliff.  For starting fishing a couple of years ago, don't ya think this is being just a bit rooster-y?  Rubbing it in that you can catch fish out of the sewer using a kids rod."
229096,fishnsled,2008-07-17 21:04:00,3520,
229097,ccmtcanada,2008-07-17 21:09:00,7971, There is a spot in the foreground that you cant really see...the opening is a lot bigger    Figured you'd do that Glen......    Yep...you do know that spot...now keep a lid on it...
229100,ccmtcanada,2008-07-17 21:15:00,7971," I was going to use my ice fishing rod, but that would have been over the top I think.  Plus...that Barbie rod catches lots of fish!!"
229107,snag,2008-07-17 21:24:00,1932,Grate catch!
229112,ccmtcanada,2008-07-17 21:30:00,7971, 
229128,grt1,2008-07-17 22:09:00,638,"that looks like a ""sewer sauger"" to me"
229144,HTHM,2008-07-17 22:42:00,4082,"I don't know what is funnier, the pic or the claim by Cliff that he was thinking"
229179,JohnF,2008-07-18 00:27:00,3494,"Has anyone thought to mention to Cliff that the Barby rod may be a big part of the reason Bly always outfishes him? I mean it's as cute as all get out, and is a great colour for him and all, but ... well...  Cliff, confidentially, if it's a money issue, I've got a few somewhat more manly rods and reels here you could choose from. It would be great for your self-esteem to at least look like a manly fisher, even if yer wife kicks yer butt all the time on the water.  JF"
229246,fishindevil,2008-07-18 02:25:00,6254,Cliff i think you have issuses man !!!!!!...they have people for that you know !!.LOL..LOL..LOL..
