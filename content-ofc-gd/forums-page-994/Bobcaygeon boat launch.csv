229711,Jonaton,2008-07-19 00:26:00,72,I will be heading up to Pigeon lake this coming Sunday and have not had a whole lot of luck finding a launch in the Bobcaygeon area. I know there are a few marinas but none of them seem to mention a launch available to the public. Anyone have any recomendations in the area?  Thanks in advance for any help you can offer Cheers Jonaton
229717,pigeonfisher,2008-07-19 00:39:00,696,Take 36 out of Bob to Nogies Creek and then stop at the bridge.  On your right is a public'ish ramp at the small bait store that may not be open.  On the West side of the bridge is a very public launch.  Visit the Nogies Creek bridge...look left and right.  Have a good one.

229768,Beans,2008-07-19 02:05:00,3339,There is a public launch right in town on the north side of the river...make a left after you go over the big bridge on 36 and go down by the river...the launch is right near the stop sign...
