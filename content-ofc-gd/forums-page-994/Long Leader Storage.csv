Some are up to 3 feet long and I am just curious as to how you guys store them.  For now, I roll them up and put them back in the Seaguar bag that the fluoro came in but I am looking for an easier access more manageable solution. So I pose the question,  How do you store your over length leaders?  Thanks in advance,"

I use these for worm harness holders aswell.I have even used plastic water bottles in a pinch to hold leaders aswell as shot lines when steelheading. Same idea rap the leader around the bottle and hold in place with tooth pics"
