229034,JohnF,2008-07-17 18:58:00,3494,"I've kept quiet, mostly cuz I have no idea of the true extent of the problem as it applies to each of us in Canada. Much of the fear I suspect is driven by media reports of financial problems in the US housing market, and the reaction to rising oil prices across the N.A. market.  About all I'm reasonably certain of is that anyone who expects no negative change in their economic condition for an entire lifetime is in for some letdowns. Today it's at least as important as it was 100 years ago to be able to adapt. It's more complex nowadays but it still comes down to whether or not you have the tools to adapt to whatever comes your way. Maintaining the status quo is a fairy tale, no matter how many people tell you it's possible. Don't wait for the government, your employer or your union to put you first. They're all just trying to survive themselves, and any benefit to you is purely incidental.  They used to call it rolling with the punches, or versatility, but at the end of the day it's just plain old survival. There's no point in being down in the mouth about it. Just deal with it. Somebody throws you a lemon, make lemonade. (I like that one).  Good luck to all of us. We're better off here than folks in a lot of other parts of the world.  JF"
229036,Vanselena,2008-07-17 19:00:00,269,"The slowdown we are starting to see has been known for sometime. Those that have been preparing by reducing debt will be fine. Those that have been accumulating debt will wish they hadn't.  The global environment is changing, it has gone too far to be stopped. Currently 2/3 of metals are being used by China and India, that leaves 1/3 for the rest of the world. Many metal companies like GE are no longer selling metals to other companies because with the increased demand from China and India, GE simply doesn't have enough to sell.  If you think we are seeing a resource squeeze now then wait a few more years. All I can say is it's a good thing we are a natural resource country. Being a manufacturer I am being told this resource squeeze will last at least 10 years. In other words, oil, copper, steel, nickel, corn etc... will continue to become more expensive until those two countries have finished their growth spurt. If you want a stable job with a good future then you may want to look into the mining, oil and gas, or farming industry. If you are in NA auto manufacturing or customer support services,,, well you may want to rethink your career path."

229062,JohnF,2008-07-17 20:06:00,3494, Wouldn't it be nice if the political types put twice the amount of energy into fulfilling their election promises and mandate and half as much into following the party line? We're the willing victims of a massive con job.  JF

227025,oxcowboy,2008-07-13 14:54:00,544," your right bnb it is trot not trout.  i have ran several in my days, and caught some pretty good catfish on them.  the point i was trying to make though is that if all this gloom and doom does come about, i feel pretty confident that i could live off of the land for quite a while.  i feel sorry for the people that have no idea of how to fend for themselves.  you would be surprised how many children in some of our big cities have know idea where their food comes from other than the store.  a large part of our population wouldnt have a clue as to how to plant a garden, raise livestock or poultry.  how would they survive? could they survive?  jason"
227034,TJQ,2008-07-13 15:18:00,7806,"I generally never weigh in in these threads... but as far as I'm concerned... the whole slowdown right now is based on a bunch of banks that lent dough for mortgages to people who shouldn't have qualified and speculators propping up the price of gas.  Did anyone ever think that maybe the people/institutions who invested in the US mortgage market are now speculating in Oil and driving the prices up to recoup their world class losses??? (my own personal conspiracy theory.)  And maybe its a good thing anyway... Why is it a good thing... cause its forcing us to look at alternatives like electric and hybrid, which will reduce demand for gas and force the price lower eventually anyway.. it will also slow down the Chinese economy... cause they are paying the same price as us!!  Sooner or later its gonna come down to it cost more to ship it here than it does to build it locally or nationally anyway.  In Sturgeon, we have a Manufacturing Plant coming in to town, built by a US company...  It will manufacture Roof Bolts and Plates for underground mining....  150 decent production jobs!!  Why??? cause were right in the hub of mining in N Ontario.. and its cheaper to distribute finished product... especially heavy product right from here....  I think its a sign of better things to come.  If GM would have had some foresight and started manufacturing small trucks like my old Toyota 4 cylinder... the plant would never be closing.  Where did those trucks go???  I think we are going through a GLOBAL adjustment...  I still have 30 years or so left in me .. and I'm gonna live every one of them to the max.  My dads been telling me there's another depression coming for the last 35 years....  I'm still waiting.     Why cause its much easier to manipulate the price of oil... than gold...."

227053,johnnycarpor,2008-07-13 16:24:00,4,"  Agreed 100%.  People need to realize that everyone from Donald Trump to an old widow in a one bedroom apartment will be/are being effected.  I also happen to be in a ""recession proof"" industry, but everything around me is getting more expensive, and my salary is not going up fast enough to meet this demand.  Look at the fact that natural gas prices just went up by 30-45 % in Ontario.  In the end, everyone on this board will be somehow effected.  The only way this can be fixed is by coming up viable, low-cost, alternative energy sources (that's a mouthful, I know)."

228916,Benthook,2008-07-17 14:34:00,56,Thanks for all the feedback...  ...it's cool this thread kept civil....just was curious to see how everyone felt about state of things....I guess some people and companies in fact benefit from an economic slowdown while others take a hit....theres always a positive side even to down turns I suppose but in the whole big picture and scheme of things I just hope that some of the clowns that run and control this country and it's economic turmoils and turbulences do the right thing for the better of the country~!
