We could smell wood burning, most likely a campfire. Chuck's truck wasn't parked where we had started paddling, but maybe he came in through another route? Well, Chuck wasn't there and Colin took advantage and caught 2 good ones.       "
1044799,Chuck Enwinde,2019-05-21 06:26:00,247,I was poking around the day before but I know Colin likes catching the big ones so I left them alone.
1044813,BassMan11,2019-05-21 12:27:00,583,Beauties Chris!
1044815,Joeytier,2019-05-21 13:53:00,3990,Sweet splakers!
1044827,captpierre,2019-05-21 16:29:00,2521,Nice!  Never caught one of those beauties. Do they fight more like lakers or brookies?
1044844,chris.brock,2019-05-22 01:30:00,4053,The bigger ones seem to bulldog and resist for a long time but no crazy runs or acrobatics
1044899,Cando,2019-05-22 21:56:00,90,Nice catch. I haven't fished for them in decades. Use to go to Owen Sound
