1044636,Old Man,2019-05-16 22:51:00,822,Thanks. I’m impressed with the build quality of it. 
1044637,Old Man,2019-05-16 22:55:00,822,"The one down side is that you can’t trim out a Jet Drive so they can be a little rougher in the waves. Also coming into dock is a bit more of an adventure. You only have steering control when you have thrust, also they do not reverse fast. So it is a little more unforgiving."
1044638,Old Man,2019-05-16 22:59:00,822,It does ?
1044644,Old Man,2019-05-17 00:27:00,822, 
1044697,captpierre,2019-05-17 22:11:00,2521,Nice. You see those on the Fraser R. sturgeon fishing shows.
1044705,Old Ironmaker,2019-05-18 03:06:00,8243,"Now there is one head turner. That hull looks very StarCraft. Congrats Sir, she is gonna move tout suite."
1044512,Old Man,2019-05-14 23:57:00,822,Looking forward to getting this out on the water.   
1044513,cisco,2019-05-15 00:04:00,597,For an old man you're sure gonna scoot in that beautiful jet rig! Congrats!!
1044514,Freshtrax,2019-05-15 00:10:00,2215,nice ride
1044515,BillM,2019-05-15 00:13:00,17367,That will be fun to fish out of.
1044516,Terry,2019-05-15 00:15:00,14456,Nice looking boat
1044518,misfish,2019-05-15 00:20:00,29133,WOW Very nice rig
1044520,Lape0019,2019-05-15 00:42:00,647,Nice rig!
1044521,Hack_Fisherman,2019-05-15 00:52:00,720,SICK WITH ENVY
1044522,Hack_Fisherman,2019-05-15 00:55:00,720,"Wait, fill us in on this awesome rig!  is that a jet drive? what are the dual canisters that look like mufflers under the platform? Pics pics and more pics!"
1044523,Pigeontroller,2019-05-15 01:02:00,2793,Very nice!
1044525,Old Man,2019-05-15 01:49:00,822,Double post 
1044526,Old Man,2019-05-15 01:52:00,822,Yes it’s a jet boat and those are the exhaust. 
1044527,Old Man,2019-05-15 01:53:00,822,Had it out for the break in. It does get up and move.
1044531,lew,2019-05-15 12:00:00,12766,"Very nice boat indeed, congratulations. Looks like it'll handle big water without any issues."
1044542,Rattletrap2,2019-05-15 14:40:00,1652,Very nice! Something you don't see around here everyday!
1044544,mistaredone,2019-05-15 15:01:00,913,Nice!!!
1044553,OhioFisherman,2019-05-15 16:46:00,6623,https://kingfisherboats.com/boats/river-jet-1875-falcon/ Nice looking boat!
1044588,Rizzo,2019-05-15 21:55:00,4754,very sexy boat!
1044610,mamona,2019-05-16 13:25:00,597,"Is it brand new? Man, I am so jealous."
1044614,Old Man,2019-05-16 15:54:00,822,Yes it is. Takes a little bit to get use to the Jet Drive. Handles completely different.  
1044615,OhioFisherman,2019-05-16 16:06:00,6623,Up north with all the rocks no lower unit in the water is a plus? How big is your kicker motor? the prop looks huge?
1044622,glen,2019-05-16 18:26:00,2641,It looks like It’s doing 100mph but it’s still on the trailer. 
1044623,OhioFisherman,2019-05-16 18:35:00,6623,200 hp on a 19 foot aluminum should move well!
1044626,David Chong,2019-05-16 18:50:00,836,That is one SWEET rig! 
1044635,Old Man,2019-05-16 22:50:00,822,"We have a lot of rocks and reefs in our lake and many channels, creeks and rivers. It’s a 9.9 Merc Pro Kicker four stroke. It moves it along nicely."
