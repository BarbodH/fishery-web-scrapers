1043358,boombap,2019-04-20 20:21:00,310,Happened to me multiple times. I dealt with it all of last year.. no more. My MK plug is now only covering up a hole.
1043604,Steve.p,2019-04-25 14:01:00,7,I purchased one of these over the winter - will be putting it on next week when my Key West FS219 comes out of storage... https://minnkotamotors.johnsonoutdoors.com/accessories/trolling-motor/plug-receptacle-saltwater-mkr-24 I had to buy it through Amazon and have it shipped from the US but it appears to be well worth the $150 I had to pay for it. Minn Kota are now looking for a new manufacturer of the plug based on feedback from Johnson.   
1043606,Lape0019,2019-04-25 14:17:00,647,That actually looks pretty sweet Steve.p
1044397,AKRISONER,2019-05-13 14:56:00,5558,"digging up an old thread here, but I thought I would share my experience with you all as the design style of the marinco plug design nearly cost me my boat, and perhaps more this past weekend. But here is my story... I have had issues with the provided marinco receptacle since I first installed it on my boat. I have found it extremely difficult to keep the power and ground wires held into the receptacle with the crappy short screws included with it. As you all know, the style is to push the wires in from the back and screw down on the wire. The first time I had a problem, I was in a tournament and the power and ground wire literally fell out of the plug, shorted on each other and blew my fuse. leaving me rewiring the TM and changing my fuses in the middle of a tournament. I thought that was pretty crap until saturday afternoon. I was fishing a small bay while running autochart live. I frequent the area and figured, why not finish charting the small bay that i was in so that I would have a map of the drop off that leads out of it. I sped the motor up and began driving back and forth from inside the bay out into the channel and back mapping. Sure enough on my final pass on the eastern edge of the bay I am driving along right against the rocks mapping the edge when my trolling motor quits. I think, Its probably just a loose plug, so i push it in and the power turns on again and i hit drive and it shuts off immediately again. With the wind blessfully taking a second off i scramble to the driver seat fire up the big motor (that two stroke took painfully too long to turn over, what was probably 2 seconds felt like hours) i missed the rocks by about 6 inches and drove out into the channel. Lifted the TM and went home to figure out what the heck was wrong. When i took my access panel off, this is what I found.  My ground line had started fraying in behind the plug, as more and more wire frayed it began to lower the guage of the wire until a point where the resistance grew so big that the wire literally lit on fire all while not blowing my fuse because it was the ground wire. I called up a family friend and life long electrician and he recommended to simply go with a contractor grade commercial receptacle and plug. Thats the game plan now! Scary stuff      "
1044411,Sinker,2019-05-13 18:00:00,8692,"Just get rid of the plug all together. There is no need for it at all. Hardwire it together, solder, shrink wrap and never worry about it again. That plug is such a hassle. I took mine out about 10 years ago, or more, and never had an issue since.  S."
1044414,AKRISONER,2019-05-13 18:26:00,5558,"I see your point but then you dont have the ability to take the trolling motor off of the boat when need be. If i had a heated shop to park my boat in then that would be an option but i dont, so its nice to be able to take the motor off if need be. I.e. I recent installed a new down image transducer on the TM and it was nice to be able to bring it inside from the rain and cold and wire it."
1044415,G.mech,2019-05-13 18:34:00,830,I don't know what that wire is (or was) but it certainly doesn't look like marine grade wire nor does it look of adequate size but it's kind of hard to tell.  There are lots of options for plugs if you want the ability to remove the motor but starting with the right materials in the first place can't be a bad thing....
1044419,Sinker,2019-05-13 19:16:00,8692,I'd rather dress warm than have my boat catch on fire! Just sayin lol These work good as well. http://www.quickcable.com/products.php?pageId=148
1044425,G.mech,2019-05-13 20:03:00,830,"If you're worried about your boat catching on fire, you maybe should re-think the 'no fuse/no breaker' idea....I get the argument about the plug but this is really stretching the safety thing."
1044429,boombap,2019-05-13 20:11:00,310,You definitely want to use a fuse.. anderson plugs are working great.
1044430,gaspumper,2019-05-13 20:28:00,393,I picked mine up at NAPA
1044434,AKRISONER,2019-05-13 21:27:00,5558,"Fuse your stuff people, mice and vermin are jerks and would love to try and short your wires and light your boat on fire at the first chance they get!"
1042987,boombap,2019-04-13 21:12:00,310,"What plug are you guys using for your trolling motors? Im using the minn kota plug with the 6 gauge adapter and I’m sick of it. Either the wires come loose or the screws that hold the wires strip. Looking for a better option.. and at this point I don’t care how much it costs. Please guys, any input is appreciated. Motor is a 80# terrova if that matters.  Thanks."
1042989,Fisherman,2019-04-13 21:30:00,7201,"Go google ""Anderson Connectors"",  they come in a variety of application and sizes.  Here's a place for examples,  they are very good quality come in all size wires.  People use them for winches,  booster cable sets, etc so there will be an application that you can use 2 of them for foolproof connections, they're polarized. https://www.acklandsgrainger.com/en/product/CONNECTOR%2CWIRE-CABLE/p/WWG3BY21"
1042990,boombap,2019-04-13 22:02:00,310,Sweet. Ordering from that website would take too long.. found these on amazon https://www.amazon.ca/Extreme-Max-5600-3102-Battery-Connect/dp/B00VRF7640/ref=asc_df_B00VRF7640/?tag=googleshopc0c-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=292944454766&hvpos=1o2&hvnetw=g&hvrand=13233813681759842771&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9000971&hvtargid=pla-433997423176&psc=1  What do you think?
1042992,Fisherman,2019-04-13 22:52:00,7201,"Bingo!  If you search around they also have a mounting plate for the one that stays in the boat so it doesn't flop around.   On the one for the trolling motor, they have a T handle to attach to make it easier to remove."
1042993,boombap,2019-04-13 23:17:00,310,Just ordered it. How did you go about installing the wire into the connectors? Crimp tool? Solder? Don't have access to either.
1042995,OhioFisherman,2019-04-14 00:02:00,6623,"I used the Anderson ones on my boat and crimped them with a crimping tool, the other one looks the same. Home Depot or a place like that probably sells them or may rent one?"
1042997,Fisherman,2019-04-14 00:13:00,7201,"Crimp and definitely solder with electronic rosin core solder.  Don't use the plumbing stuff,  it will degrade the connection after a while.  One of your buddies must have a good soldering iron."
1043000,BillM,2019-04-14 01:10:00,17367,"I use the standard Minn Kota plug.  I can never get that stupid thing in straight the first time, lol.  I should probably just mark the plug and receptacle and stop driving myself insane. I should probably upgrade to the Marinco 12VCPS3."
1043003,Fisherman,2019-04-14 01:17:00,7201,"Ow, between $80-$90 ."
1043007,boombap,2019-04-14 01:43:00,310,It's a piece of junk.. not worth what it costs retail. Early mornings I always have a hard time getting it straight. I'm over it.. hope this new plug is what it's supposed to be. Guess Ill pony up the $ for a nice set of crimpers. Thanks again boys.
1043008,misfish,2019-04-14 02:04:00,29133,Not sure why they all don't go that way. Plug and play.

1043013,G.mech,2019-04-14 03:03:00,830,"54 bucks on Amazon, 34 for the two wire model (plug and receptacle combo).  They seem to work fine for me. https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B002IVEFD2/ref=twister_B06Y4KF2SG?_encoding=UTF8&th=1"

1043028,Sinker,2019-04-14 13:40:00,8692,"No plug for me. Stupid thing is always the weak link so I removed it and now have straight power from the battery to the motor. I also upgraded the wire. Way better, and never had an issue since. "

1043038,boombap,2019-04-14 16:14:00,310,Might have to take you up on that if the wires ever come loose on Sturgeon ? I did that with my first boat.. how do you go about charging? Not worried?
1043082,Sinker,2019-04-15 15:10:00,8692,"Been that way for about 10 years now. I don't disconnect anything. Never had an issue. I don't even run a fuse, it was also a pain in the butt, so its straight 6 Ga wire from motor to battery. (might even be 4 ga, I forget now)"
1043085,Lape0019,2019-04-15 15:33:00,647,"This is what Bass Cat uses and it gets good reviews. I know you already ordered something but just in case. http://products.batterytender.com/Accessories/DC-POWER-CONNECTOR-KIT.html FYI, That Minnkota plug everyone is complaining about is made by marinco. And anyone having issues lining them up, there is a little arrow on both the plug and the receptacle. If you've hooked the two pieces up correctly, they will line up and plug in perfectly. I never had an issue with lining them up. I did have issues with the 6 gauge adapter loosening off... The ultrex on the new boat is wired direct and I just flip the breaker off to charge."
1043101,gaspumper,2019-04-15 21:26:00,393,NAPA also carries these.
1043107,boombap,2019-04-15 23:20:00,310,The problem with lining it up isn’t so much the actual plug.. but the mounting plate with the small tooth/indent that the female plug has to lineup with. I always had a problem where the screws came loose on the mounting plate and the male plug would just spin and not engage. A shame too because they were so close to getting it right. The 6awg adapter needs some type of clip/bracket to hold the wires in place so they won’t loosen over time. Got the suggested plug in the mail today.. looks good.
1043297,smitty55,2019-04-19 00:58:00,928,"Hmmm, I worked in the aviation industry for over 35 years and have dealt with connectors from large ones with heavy wire up to 4ga on an engine harness down to 124 pin connectors using 24ga wire. It was always crimp OR solder never both. Mostly by far it was crimping as it allowed for more flexibility in the wire, the theory being that with the constant vibrations in aircraft a soldered wire in a pin or socket was too stiff and vibration was more likely to result in broken strands. Now I'm not saying that it would be an issue here, but boats are subject to a lot of vibration as well so it might be something to consider. You're right about the solder, nowadays the flux is organic and non corrosive.  Cheers"
1043351,boombap,2019-04-20 18:30:00,310,"Anderson plugs installed.. had to order a cheapo crimper off amazon. Nice plug, should last a long time. A good option for anyone looking."
1043355,AKRISONER,2019-04-20 19:25:00,5558,I’m so tired of my MK receptacle letting the power cables bloody fall out. One time they even fell out started shorting off of each other and blew my fuse. Really safe stuff. I wonder what kinda law suit I could have started had my boat lit on fire.
