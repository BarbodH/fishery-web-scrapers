1043741,OhioFisherman,2019-04-29 14:49:00,6623,One of my daughters lives in Florida and sent me this picture she took of a fish from a freshwater lake? Peacock bass? Can't think of anything else myself.
1043742,AKRISONER,2019-04-29 14:57:00,5558,pretty sure thats a peacock 
1043745,BillM,2019-04-29 15:06:00,17367,"Yup, good bet."
1043746,OhioFisherman,2019-04-29 15:32:00,6623,"Thanks guys, not real sure what other invasive species they have there, it didn't look like anything we see here."
1043761,Dozer,2019-04-30 00:50:00,896,Mayan cichlid
1043763,OhioFisherman,2019-04-30 01:14:00,6623,"Dozer, now that I have seen a picture of those I am now leaning more to them, thanks, never heard of them."
1043766,Chuck Enwinde,2019-04-30 04:09:00,247,I think Dozer has it.  They seem a bit small for spawning peacock's.
1043789,OhioFisherman,2019-04-30 15:56:00,6623,"Ya, couldn't really get a size reference from that picture, and no idea how big peacocks have to be to start spawning, but with two of those fish in the picture at this time of year it did seem like a spawning thing."
1043792,jimmer,2019-04-30 16:30:00,2730,Why do people let their aquarium fish go into lakes? Worst crime possible for the environment.
1043795,bassman87,2019-04-30 18:41:00,586,peacock tilapia sorry yeah looks like mayan cichlid after i searched them lol
1043797,Tom S,2019-04-30 19:16:00,362,Looks like they get a bit bigger than your typical sunfish. Probably lots of fun on  light tackle. https://www.bigcatchflorida.com/eligible-species/mayan-cichlid.aspx
1044401,bonessk01,2019-05-13 15:20:00,40,"just got back from Fort Lauderdale area and they are all an absolute hoot on spinning and fly rod tackle caught cichlids, oscars, peacocks. all public all diy. I could get hooked on them pretty quick pun intended sorry!"
1044404,OhioFisherman,2019-05-13 15:54:00,6623,"LOL, take a look on the list for Florida's state record for red ear sunfish, 4.86 pounds?  Panfish as big as the pan? When I was young my next door neighbor's grandfather had a 2 acre pond out in the country here in northern Ohio, it was pretty common to catch bluegills pushing a pound there, for there size they fought well!"
1044405,OhioFisherman,2019-05-13 15:55:00,6623,Puns are fun?
1044412,grimsbylander,2019-05-13 18:04:00,3016,Which fish? The little striped fellow or the one on bottom directly below it? ?
1044445,OhioFisherman,2019-05-14 00:52:00,6623,"I saw 2 fish in the picture too, no idea of the color variations on those fish, but they both look to be the same species to me."
1044451,Dozer,2019-05-14 02:06:00,896,"Fired up male and a female most likely - or a male sub.  They're a riot to catch on ultra light and make fantastic gator food, along with the 100 other invasive fish species found in the waterways.  Hurray for invasives diversity!"
1044456,OhioFisherman,2019-05-14 02:27:00,6623,https://www.sun-sentinel.com/sports/fl-sp-outdoors-everglades-fishing-20170511-story.html Evidently they are good people food too?
1044504,Dozer,2019-05-14 22:46:00,896,I'm firing up the pan next time - hopefully a gator doesn't come and decide I'm sharing my catch.
1044625,David Chong,2019-05-16 18:45:00,836,Dozer is correct! There are all kinds of Cichlids in FL!
1044785,bonessk01,2019-05-21 00:04:00,40,"this is one i caught first week of may, Coral Springs area in the C14 canal there were hundreds of them like bluegill along the shore just finished spawning "
1044793,bonessk01,2019-05-21 00:50:00,40,heres a peacock and an oscar
