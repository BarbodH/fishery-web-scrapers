1044047,AKRISONER,2019-05-06 13:54:00,5558,"sweet report, warmer days warmer days will soon be here"
1044049,jimmer,2019-05-06 14:14:00,2730,"Great write up. I especially found the rock pictures very interesting, so different. Amazing fishing by the looks of your haul. That would be a dream trip for me..... Thanks for sharing."

1044087,Freshtrax,2019-05-07 02:07:00,2215,nice read got me itchin for Nipigon pike in a month!
1044096,SirCranksalot,2019-05-07 02:42:00,3291,"Cheaper than Howard's on Stinger? Is that why you didn't go back there??  BTW---How's your friend, the Borgerman?"
1044137,Jmeyer,2019-05-08 02:50:00,83,Percy is a helluva good bang for the buck as far as a Fly in goes in that area and I'm not sure what stingers rates are currently because Howard no longer owns it Pennocks bought it two years ago.
1044175,Cando,2019-05-08 21:30:00,90,Great write up and amazing catch. I'd love to do a fly in but I fear being out of range of a hospital. I never know when an infection of some kind will flare up.
1044237,chris.brock,2019-05-10 05:17:00,4053,"Borgerman is good. He's got a head start, but if I paddle fast I'm gonna catch up and see him tomorrow. Drive in, but I'd go back to Stinger in a heartbeat. I loved it. I just wish the camp would have ended up in different hands, Jason's hands to be specific, lol."
1044253,akaShag,2019-05-10 14:09:00,2073,Some guy left a floating marker out there.............?
1044325,Moosebunk,2019-05-12 01:27:00,3970,"Have heard that buzz before in the woods... INTENSE buzz that builds at dark, stays a short while and almost suddenly stops. You write them better than anyone really. And a great mix of photos. Have had this one up on the screen a couple days knowing not to miss it. Glad that didn't happen. Enjoy the next stop bud!"
1044326,Hack_Fisherman,2019-05-12 02:27:00,720,"Wow, what a great post/report. I’d love to check this place out!"

1044887,wantabigone,2019-05-22 17:57:00,97,Nice write up. I am missing my annual trip this year so these stories will have to keep my satisfied! 
1044967,Jmeyer,2019-05-23 22:46:00,83,Missing your annual trip? That's just wrong. Hope it's not health related and just a hard schedule. If you find time this summer give me a shout may be I can help you out
1044970,David Chong,2019-05-23 23:44:00,836,Nice write-up and a great read! Love giant pike and you guys got some beauties! Those rocks were pretty intriguing as well!
