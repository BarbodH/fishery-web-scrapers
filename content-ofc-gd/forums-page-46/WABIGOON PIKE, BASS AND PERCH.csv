Water is still chilly, with the highest surface temp being 54℉. Bass and Pike are aggressive at the moment, preferring large swimbaits and spinnerbaits over live baits. Perch are where they should be but bite is slow. A week or so and the crappie should move in which is a bonus, but there are plenty of in season fish biting without the crappie and walleye. "
