1044790,glen,2019-05-21 00:26:00,2641,That’s the second time it was stuck. The first time I had to jack it up and put logs in the ruts. Never put 90* turns in the middle of a mud hole.
1044791,glen,2019-05-21 00:28:00,2641,If it keeps raining I’ll be able to fish the ruts.
1044800,misfish,2019-05-21 09:51:00,29133,Yup it looks stuck.
1044817,Lape0019,2019-05-21 14:27:00,647,That looks like a fun time. LOL. Well... until you get stuck but that's part of the experience.
1044826,DRIFTER_016,2019-05-21 15:56:00,10439,"That's not stuck, just a minor inconvenience. Back in the 80's we got my friends Dodge Ramcharger stuck going in the back route to an off road race. We found a little mud patch and played for a bit until we got stuck. His truck had a 12"" lift and 44"" mudders on it. When we gave up trying to get out by ourselves the rocker panels were touching the ground. My buddy was one of the marshals at the race so we went to the race and got some of the boys to pull us out after the race. It two rows of 4X4's and two big winches to pull us out. One line had 7 vehicles and the other had 8!!! That's stuck."
1044830,glen,2019-05-21 17:11:00,2641,Everyone knows when Dave does something he does it right. but did the ram charger start on fire? The pic was the second time it got stuck. Not near as bad as the first time.   It started a grass fire under the engine. I thought it was going to burn to the ground.  I quickly grabbed all of my gear out.  Now that it’s out it’s starting to be funny.
1044833,DRIFTER_016,2019-05-21 19:22:00,10439,"Wasn't me, it was my buddy. I was just along for the ride."
1044718,glen,2019-05-19 01:36:00,2641,I got my jimmy stuck in the mud.  It’s hung up on the skid plate there are trees to hook onto.  I tried a come along.  But it would not move it at all. I’m thinking about jacking it up and putting trees in the ruts then I need some thing to pull with.  The mud is 12” deep. How much force does a load binder screw type.  Have. What else will pull. Thanks for any ideas.
1044719,OhioFisherman,2019-05-19 01:46:00,6623,"Is there a Canadian version of the triple a? you may need a tow truck, perhaps your auto insurance covers it?"
1044721,glen,2019-05-19 01:53:00,2641,I was off roading.  No tow truck going to make it in there.
1044722,OhioFisherman,2019-05-19 02:33:00,6623,"Some of those load binders are very strong, you may need a piece of pipe to use as a handle extension to get the full strength. Most of the load binders I have seen as a former truck driver have a limited range of travel, it may be a long process using one for that purpose, you also have to be very careful of chain or cable breakage.  Got a friend with a pickup? is the whole area mud? You don't want 2 stuck trucks."
1044723,mikeh,2019-05-19 03:11:00,824,what area is it stuck? Barrie?
1044724,glen,2019-05-19 03:14:00,2641,Thanks. once it’s free from the hole it’s in it might not high side again. I wouldn’t risk another truck.  Firmer drowns is 60’ away. The load binder I’m looking at is over 9000#. Might be nice to have. Brake it loose wthat the binder and come along after that.
1044725,glen,2019-05-19 03:17:00,2641,Off road trail 30 min north of barrie jimmy is narrow trail is narrow.  My jimmy is stock four door very low to ground.  A winch would pull it out
1044726,woodenboater,2019-05-19 03:40:00,2277,"when I had a Jeep, I'd always meant to make boards for the times snow and mud was iffy. Basically was thinking of maybe four lengths of 2x12x4 (or 5) with hex head machine screws for something for the rubber to grab. Screws would go through the board and the business end would stick out maybe 1/2"" or so, again for sticktion. Good luck with the retrieval."
1044727,DRIFTER_016,2019-05-19 03:40:00,10439,Get a high lift farm jack and fill in the ruts with logs. https://www.tractorsupply.com/tsc/product/bulldog-36-in-farm-jack 
1044729,glen,2019-05-19 12:45:00,2641,I can jack it up and put logs in the ruts but I still need a pull out. Mom thinking about trying the heavy screw load binder.
1044730,nlpaintballer,2019-05-19 12:48:00,122,A 3-5 ton chainfall. Pulled the fully loaded sander out of a ditch this year. Slow but it will do the job.
1044731,OhioFisherman,2019-05-19 15:19:00,6623,"https://www.homedepot.com/p/Big-Red-5-Ton-Chain-Hoist-TR9050/100594513 That seems a better option to me than a load binder, he will still need a lot of chain, and it may only move it 10 feet or so at a time?"
1044732,shanty gord,2019-05-19 15:23:00,16,Where are you stuck I live in Oro-Medonte. I could come and see if I could pull it out for you
1044733,OhioFisherman,2019-05-19 15:48:00,6623,"Just a thought, you might call the OPP? I am guessing they may have dealt with things like this before and may have a suggestion? They may know of someone that provides tows in this type of situation?"
1044735,lew,2019-05-19 16:39:00,12766,Just another thought here but any chance there's any off road clubs around the area ? Those guys are always getting bogged down but they have winches on their trucks and they may be able to get you out.

1044741,Fisherman,2019-05-19 18:31:00,7201,"Just came back from an ATV ride up there in Wildman Forest, some of those trails still have virtual lakes on them.  Every now and then they non ATVers get caught and pay."
1044743,DRIFTER_016,2019-05-19 19:18:00,10439,rent a portable winch?
1044746,glen,2019-05-19 20:23:00,2641,My brother drove it out while I pulled it with a tractor and we got it out ion firm ground. The ground had a bit of crust to it and once you started to spin the ruts went down over 12”.  Just as I got it out it started to rain again. I’m going to look at the chain  fall THANK YOU    For your offers of help.

1044760,fish_fishburn,2019-05-20 12:35:00,1311,If your using a come along you prolly need a snatch blok to make it work for you.
1044766,OhioFisherman,2019-05-20 16:30:00,6623,"Glen, if you have it out you might want to take it to an auto wash that can clean the bottom so you can inspect it for any damage?"
