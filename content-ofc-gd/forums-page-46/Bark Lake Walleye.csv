I caught mine along rocky shorelines, but I also understand there are deep water fish that move up on the sand flats. (that's an evening bite though)"
1044884,smitty55,2019-05-22 16:01:00,928,This early in the season I would likely stick around the top end of the lake where the river comes in. Good luck.  Cheers
