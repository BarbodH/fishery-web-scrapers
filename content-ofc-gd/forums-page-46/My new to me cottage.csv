1044907,Old Ironmaker,2019-05-23 03:04:00,8243,"Cliff, if it was 30 years ago I could fill all the seats with cute, young female co-pilots. But it isn't 30 years ago, Same great lady for 26 now. I still think she is young and beyond cute, she's a 6 foot tall beauty. Actually she modeled for a few years. If you got the Sears catalogues in the 80's you may have seen her. Also a Sunshine Girl.  Many have asked over the years if she is legally blind, Funny. She is just as beautiful inside, that's the key for me."
1044913,Big Cliff,2019-05-23 09:25:00,6899,"I'd love to do that, if we can get him upt the stairs and in the door I'm sure we could make him comfortable. What did you buy? Yup has a built in 4000 watt generator, fully independent ?"
1044923,woodenboater,2019-05-23 12:57:00,2277,niiice. you plan to tow a second vehicle or boat. or neither ?
1044924,Big Cliff,2019-05-23 13:08:00,6899,It is equipped with a hitch but I don't know if I will at this point
1044925,Loonietoon,2019-05-23 13:36:00,1450,1996 Ford 28ft Royal Classic big enough for me 
1044957,Sinker,2019-05-23 19:32:00,8692,"Nice Cliff, that's awesome!!! S."
1044974,Big Cliff,2019-05-24 00:10:00,6899,That's a beauty!  Exactly what I was looking for.  I couldn't find one so I bought the class A
1044988,Loonietoon,2019-05-24 13:30:00,1450,"Took me quite a while to find the one l wanted Cliff, lots of the wrong style for what l was looking for. ?"
1044989,Rattletrap2,2019-05-24 13:31:00,1652,Is this the V10 engine? My Buddy has a 34 footer with the V10 and it is a 1998 I believe. They have had some great trips in theirs!
1044993,Squid,2019-05-24 15:13:00,1656,That's my plan for when I retire. I plan on pulling the boat all over Ontario to fish the best musky waters around. I should get it all done in a year lol.
1044994,Squid,2019-05-24 15:14:00,1656,Nice rigs man.
1045002,Old Ironmaker,2019-05-24 21:36:00,8243,"Great looking rig Big Guy. Be careful backing her down a boat ramp. I finally watched that video of the floating RV. Anyone have any idea how that happened? No driver? They took it very well to say the least. I sure wouldn't. Tells me it is probably the sponsors not theirs. Just yesterday I wanted to back the boat up a few feet. Buddy put the receiver on the ball, I backed up and heard kabash!!!!!. Pushed the licence plate into the rubber and the rubber section of the bumper folded up like an accordion. Probably 1000 bucks damage. It's a grand for a body shop just to open a bay door now. Who's fault? My fault, I didn't double check."
1045008,Loonietoon,2019-05-25 02:00:00,1450,Yes it is
1045018,GBW,2019-05-25 14:58:00,8460,Congrats Mr Cliff.
1045019,misfish,2019-05-25 15:58:00,29133,"Seen them with hitches on the front, for driving the trailer into the water."
1045038,Gerritt,2019-05-26 13:19:00,6129,Here my new cottage....only 2 weeks old    And here is the reason why...    Should be a lot of good times
1045041,Loonietoon,2019-05-26 13:48:00,1450,Lookin Great Gerritt
1045045,Old Ironmaker,2019-05-26 18:33:00,8243,"Very close friends of ours just bought themselves a beautiful 5th wheel brand spankin' new last week. All the bells and whistles. I like the 2 big screen TV's and especially the huge dash mounted screen with GPS, Doppler weather, The Google lady in the little box, and, and, and. Bob and Gail have used a pop up for the last 25 years, the kids have flown the coop and say they should have bought one when they were little kids and went with them every weekend.  Now they have a 5 * hotel anywhere they decide to stop and are spending the kids inheritance. My wife had never seen the inside of a real deal RV. I told her years ago this might be an option for us during the winter when she retires. I would park it at a southern US park where there is actually room and you can't hear your next door neighbour do their morning duty 5 feet away. There is an RV park outside Messa Arizona where we had a place for a few years that are on 1/3 of an acre lots. Many have Solar panels set up on the large lots, plenty of Sun there, I like that. They jamb those things next to each other at parks around here. She always said never, now it's maybe. I told them we are available anytime and I will do some of the driving and all the cooking."
1045060,Big Cliff,2019-05-27 09:43:00,6899,NICE! I'm sure many wonderful memories will follow!
1045135,DRIFTER_016,2019-05-28 22:30:00,10439,When I retire I want one of these. I like the ease of mobility of a truck camper over a trailer and don't mind the smaller space. Got to get me a truck to put it in first. though. https://www.lancecamper.com/truck-campers/825/
1044801,Big Cliff,2019-05-21 10:02:00,6899,"Well, I finally decided I couldn't decide where I wanted to buy a cottage so I got one on wheels ? . It's got all the comforts of home, and I don't have to worry about finding motel rooms any more. Ready, willing, and able to go fishing anywhere, any time!   "
1044802,bigugli,2019-05-21 10:27:00,6138,WTG Cliff. Travelling and fishing in style.
1044803,b2kptbo,2019-05-21 10:27:00,1505,"WOW Cliff, it looks great, that will get you around in style for sure..."
1044806,David Chong,2019-05-21 11:04:00,836,Looks pretty comfy to me! And you eon’t Get bored of being in one place or on one body of water! Safe travels and amazing adventures ahead!
1044808,misfish,2019-05-21 11:09:00,29133,WOW. Now that's how you enjoy retirement.  Very nice
1044810,Beans,2019-05-21 11:44:00,3339,Very nice old friend...anywhere is yours now...
1044811,Loonietoon,2019-05-21 12:12:00,1450,"Looking GOOD Cliff, l also just bought a motor home 28ft we need to get together and fish ?"
1044812,aplumma,2019-05-21 12:22:00,6896,very nice well done. Art
1044816,bobowski,2019-05-21 14:13:00,360,Wow. That thing looks awesome. Congrats on the purchase.
1044818,mikeh,2019-05-21 14:42:00,824,"That looks like a great setup for you, do you need a special license to drive it?"
1044819,BillM,2019-05-21 14:49:00,17367,Awesome!
1044829,Terry,2019-05-21 16:53:00,14456,Very nice
1044832,AKRISONER,2019-05-21 18:48:00,5558,
1044834,DRIFTER_016,2019-05-21 19:23:00,10439,How's the fuel mileage?  ?
1044836,Big Cliff,2019-05-21 21:03:00,6899,"Any time my friend! No special license required, it's under the weight requirement and has hydraulic brakes Actually haven't had a chance to really plot that out yet but 328 km cost me about $130.00 @ $1.379 so it really isn't too bad. When you figure a really basic motel room up in the French River area is $100.00 + tax a night...... I will leave it at my son's place when I'm not traveling and just run back and forth with my car."
1044838,LeXXington,2019-05-21 23:38:00,1928,nice ride.
1044839,Old Ironmaker,2019-05-21 23:45:00,8243,"Who cares. What's the enjoyment mileage? That's the question. We spent a few days in a 5th wheel fishing 2 summers back.  I couldn't believe the quality and the comfort.  We only went inside to prep dinner, sleep and the other 2 things. In total comfort. You the man Cliff. I can't say how happy I am for you. If you need a co-pilot let me know."
1044841,Big Cliff,2019-05-22 00:42:00,6899,"Well it's got room for 5 more co-pilots (as long as one of them is cute and female (or 4 more of my normal friends LOL). Thanks for all the great replies, it's nice to share this with you!"
1044853,bigbuck,2019-05-22 12:08:00,2449,"Very nice!! If anyone deserves this, it is you. Many an adventure await...."
1044855,Gerritt,2019-05-22 12:34:00,6129,"Hey thats awesome! And also my retirement dream! Spring,  summer and fall in Canada and winter in the southern states! Only 20+ years of work left.........  We recently bought a travel trailer so we are able to get away from home during our downtime (currently replying from the trailers kitchen ) congrats Cliff!! Your gonna love it!"
1044860,Loonietoon,2019-05-22 12:56:00,1450,Will definitely be in touch Cliff... maybe get Beans too ?????? ?
1044867,Rattletrap2,2019-05-22 13:47:00,1652,Very nice Cliff! Freedom to go where you want.....when you want! That's what it is all about! Pick up a small generator (or maybe it already has one?) and you don't even need hook ups!
1044872,yatzekcs,2019-05-22 14:19:00,3,Congrats. If you wanna launch a boat don't do it this way  
1044895,AdamS,2019-05-22 19:44:00,161,
