Just curious if anyone suggests getting a keel guard? I pull my boat up lots onto shore. I fish alone a lot and this makes it much easier for me to launch and retrieve the boat at some of the launches I use. Lots of these areas are mud, sand, sometimes scattered rock but I noticed I'm getting some wear and scratches on the keel. Will this eventually cause any considerable damage? Any suggestions or experience with this issue? Thanks! "

1044463,b_cdot,2019-05-14 12:20:00,270,Hey I see a picture online of someone who installed one (gator guard) on a riveted boat. I wonder if it stayed on.
1044464,BillM,2019-05-14 12:49:00,17367,Not a very popular thing to put on an aluminum boat.
1044465,b_cdot,2019-05-14 13:15:00,270,But it's practical
1044466,lew,2019-05-14 13:25:00,12766,I put a keelguard on my glass Skeeter and they're quite easy to install. Here's an article on installing them on aluminum boats. https://www.gator-guards.com/tips-install-keelshield-aluminum-boats/ 
1044468,b_cdot,2019-05-14 13:40:00,270,"The lund pro v has the riveted strake on the keel which it says it's incompatible with that installation, but I see a few pics online that looks like it worked "
1044470,KraTToR,2019-05-14 13:56:00,506,This is the one I have and I beach the boat all the time.  You never know what's lurking under the sand..  Ranger Factory install
1044508,BillM,2019-05-14 23:19:00,17367,"I guess I'll let the aluminum do the work.   If it were a glass boat, then I'd say yes for sure.  Hopefully you can find something that works."
1044604,John Bacon,2019-05-16 03:19:00,3277,I think keel guards are more for fibreglass boats to protect the gel coat from scratches.  Scratches are less of an issue for aluminum.
1044607,wkrp,2019-05-16 12:43:00,656,Perhaps you could cut the keel guard  down it to avoid the riveted flanges
1044608,b_cdot,2019-05-16 13:12:00,270,"Less of an issue for sure, but if I can still find a way to protect the aluminum from getting scraped and dented it would be nice."
1044612,b_cdot,2019-05-16 14:09:00,270,"I called up Megaware keel guard which looks like a similar product to gatorguard and they say their product needs to be air and water tight or it won't adhere. That is something that crossed my mind, I don't want to be the guinea pig though.... if anyone has tried it with success I would like to know"
1044613,b_cdot,2019-05-16 14:12:00,270,That is a pretty cool vid
1044620,David Chong,2019-05-16 17:41:00,836,"I've had a Hamby's Keel Protector on probably my last 7/8 boats, highly recommend having one! Keel Guards look like they are a quality product."
1044629,wkrp,2019-05-16 20:32:00,656,Your other alternative is to punch holes in the keel guard at the rivet locations. I cannot see  the keel guard staying on with voids around the rivets.
1044663,KraTToR,2019-05-17 13:05:00,506,This shows how the surrounding sand rubs on the gel-coat but the keel guard protects the pointed edge of the keel as it moves over and into the ground.
