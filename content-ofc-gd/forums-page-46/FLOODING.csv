1044134,OhioFisherman,2019-05-08 00:02:00,6623,Lake Erie is at record high levels right now and could cause ’catastrophic’ erosion problems I guess the water level is high?
1044139,Cando,2019-05-08 07:39:00,90,I hear it is higher than Lake Ontario. Last I heard it was at 30CM or 12 inches and raising and Lake Erie was up higher than that.
1044153,dave524,2019-05-08 12:48:00,4508,"I live a 2 minute walk from the old pumping station and pier in Grimsby so I have some reference marks for water level for Ontario,  it is as high as it was in mid 80's when I moved here judging  by an old piling top that has been high and dry for the past 30 years."
1044158,OhioFisherman,2019-05-08 14:04:00,6623,"The last time I went fishing Deg and Whopper from the board took me out with one of Whopper's friends, like 2005? We started out from a western basin harbor and left a mud trail as we left the dock. Wind direction there was always a factor on the water level, but even from fishing that area from years before the water level was low. I saw a video a while back of a friend of a friend fishing a western basin harbor a couple of years ago, and it looked like the were dredging that area."
1044160,Whopper,2019-05-08 15:58:00,2174,Them was the good old days Paul  ?
1044163,Cando,2019-05-08 17:37:00,90,I live across the street from lake Ontario on the Etobicoke Creek but I've been too lazy to go across to see how high it is there. Maybe Saturday if the weather is good I'll take a trip across and look the go to the credit river. 
1044165,OhioFisherman,2019-05-08 18:53:00,6623,"LOL, ya Phil, I was walking a lot better back then!"
1044189,AKRISONER,2019-05-09 02:04:00,5558,Erie and now superior are approaching all time highs. Huron is already at its level from last year and is expected to go up another foot. Ridiculous because I spent the last 10 years worrying about low water and modifying docks and boat ramps to account for lower water and now this year I am going to have to revert everything back lol probably just in time for the water levels to fall off again.
1044201,Headhunter,2019-05-09 14:16:00,5703,The folks living on the island in Toronto harbour are going to in for it again! HH
1044203,misfish,2019-05-09 14:22:00,29133,"GBAY levels are what they were in the mid 80,s. They also say it will rise another 12 cm this year. Wind direction from the north has pushed the water over the road at Wasaga beach this year and will happen alot if the north winds pick up. There will be no beach . This means the notty will be higher then norm alot this year."
1044204,Fisherman,2019-05-09 14:24:00,7201,"Was there yesterday, if it does come up another 12cm, there won't be much beach and likey the waves will wash onto the road."
1044205,AKRISONER,2019-05-09 14:34:00,5558,"and it just keeps on raining...its been absolutely pouring here all morning and its supposed to be worse this afternoon. Luckily I cant flood here because I am close to the water, Lake Huron isnt going to rise 5 feet in a day because of some rain, but anyone on a river around here, holy crap look out! Judging just by how much water is running through my yard out of the bush, including the very small creek that runs through our yard i couldnt imagine actually living on a proper river. The entire yard by the creek is up at least a foot and thats in 2 inch deep creek. If you drive up the 400 keep an eye out when you cross the moon river, the forrest is a raging river, its absolutely nuts. Whats even more messed up is they are calling for it to be the hottest summer in history, so all of this rain is going to dump on us all spring and then it will turn to an absolute tinder box come summer time and we will have fires again up here. Bloody climate change is nuts."
1044242,fish_fishburn,2019-05-10 12:13:00,1311,The Ottawa River up by Pembroke will probably beat the old record set in 1960. Isnt pretty it rained all night really hard and more expected today. I am close enough to see the river at the end of my street. I am about 6 to 10 ft above  the existing water level. Im heading out shortly to the sandbag pickup at the other end of my street. Gonna fill some sandbags its all volunteer around here people are amazing.
1044243,bigbuck,2019-05-10 12:16:00,2449,"The Muskokas have settled down a bit, with this rain however......."
1044244,lew,2019-05-10 12:22:00,12766,Water levels have dropped quite a bit over my way but the Otonabee River is still running fast and furious. The Trent system opens next weekend...(I think)...and if the river doesn't slow down a LOT I can't imagine any boats being able to navigate it with the crazy water flow.
1044247,bigugli,2019-05-10 13:23:00,6138,"Water levels have huge fluctuations over a 50-60 year period, Yet each new generation seems to be oblivious to the problems of the past. In the early 70's water levels on L Erie were so high that numerous homes were washed out onto the lake, or had the foundation collapse due to extreme erosion.  Flooding in the Haliburtons, Muskokas or Ottawa valley is not new.  Water is not static. Nor are the shorelines. Any human action is temporary. One should not build on a flood plain. Nor places so close to the high water mark as to risk flooding.  YEt after every major flood people are allowed to rebuild in the same locations.Members of our family have lived close to water for over 70 years in Ontario. No structure has ever been placed close to the high water mark."
1044252,captpierre,2019-05-10 13:44:00,2521,Well said. People are unwise to build on floodplains and below high water mark. Who pays for damages? Owner for sure.  Insurance companies usually  don’t grant flood insurance in flood prone areas.  Governments  who grant building permits in these areas?  On our first trip to the Outer Banks in NC we saw most ocean waterfront homes on block stilts.  At a museum we saw hurricane water surge levels up to near the top of the stilts.  No brainer.
1044257,irishfield,2019-05-10 14:34:00,26272,"OPG currently using Lake Temagami as a storage lagoon, as an attempt to stop more flooding downstream, and going to wreck a LOT of crib docks with the lake still totally covered in ice!"
1044261,dave524,2019-05-10 15:14:00,4508,"Exactly, I worked on Long Point at the Provincial Park in ""73 and '74, it it was a common occurrence in those years with the right wind for the causeway on to the point to be underwater and flooding on the bayside cottages, stuck on the point waiting for the winds to change ?"
1044267,OhioFisherman,2019-05-10 16:28:00,6623,I had my Searay docked in west harbor in the Port Clinton area in the mid 1980's and it wasn't unusual to be walking thru water Memorial Day weekend to get to my dock. In the 90's some of those places in East and West harbor could have used a couple of more feet of water! When you stand a chance of 10 - 12 feet + waves hitting the shoreline with any good storm? it should be a warning not to build to close to it?
1044461,dave524,2019-05-14 12:04:00,4508,"Spoke too soon about Long Point, I see on the news this morning, the park is closed for the weekend, flooded , like back in 74 when I worked there. Now I am confused, in '74 we in in a cycle of global cooling and it flooded due to high water ,  now we are in a cycle of warming and high water is causing flooding again ? edit: in other news, a couple of days ago with the right wind, this parking lot at the old Pumphouse at the mouth of Forty Creek got flooded around the corner from my home, never seen this in thirty-five years here.   "
1043768,misfish,2019-04-30 10:11:00,29133,"My god,this is very serious. I hope the province steps in and supports ALL affected. I also hope the insurance companies are not going to look for loop holes so they don't have to pay out.  "

1043777,Old Ironmaker,2019-04-30 14:03:00,8243,I got a call from an old friend that moved from Hamilton to the Ottawa River ( Westmeath) after he retired. His wife and he had to evacuate their riverside home on Lake Coulonge that they built 4 years ago. The basement is full of water and the water and ice is 1/2 way up their 1st floor. He says it's a wright off. We live on the waters edge on Lake Erie. We haven't had a beach for the past 7 years. The water is even higher this spring as it is right to the breakwall where we once had 25 feet of sandy beach. That has caused severe erosion all along the lake. I paid $3500.00 last year to repair the armour rock breakwall as the fall storms of 017' undermined the hill behind the breakwall and the erosion was only 15 feet from our deck. That makes for some sleepless nights.
1043779,jimmer,2019-04-30 14:06:00,2730,"I believe that in over 30 years, this is the highest I have seen the water level on Pigeon Lake. I have seen a few places that are built closer to the water experiencing flooding. My thoughts are going out to the people in Minden who face this type of crisis on what seems like a yearly basis now."
1043780,Terry,2019-04-30 14:20:00,14456,"I think it’s rime to remove homes from part of the flood plane and lower the land near the rivers to allow much more water to flow. And maybe where there is dams and flood control in place , be proactive rather then reactive cause this is starting to happen every year or so if insurance pays. The rates go up, so we all pay and it just keep happening if taxes pay to solve the problem we all pay but maybe the problem gets fixed"
1043781,Old Ironmaker,2019-04-30 14:32:00,8243,A report on CBC news this morning talked of a First Nations community on the Albany River in northern Ontario that has had to be evacuated each and every year for the past 17 years. Their Chief said that they have been requesting that the entire community be relocated to another area for years. The cost to the taxpayers has been 15 to 20 million dollars per year for damages and temporary lodging for an entire town. The definition of insanity comes to mind.
1043786,Fisherman,2019-04-30 15:30:00,7201,"You also have to take the mindset into consideration.  If the pond is full of alligators, you don't go swimming in there.  If you build by the water, sooner or later you're going to get wet.  I lay a fair part of the blame on the local municipalities that allowed construction there in the first place."
1043787,OhioFisherman,2019-04-30 15:52:00,6623,"We have some local areas along the Lake Erie tributaries that seem to flood every couple of years, horror and tragedy stories on the news about the home losses and such, but they keep on allowing them to rebuild there. It's not like those areas are unknown, or the risks and dangers of living or building there? Flood me once? shame on you! flood me repeatedly? shame on me?"
1043788,Terry,2019-04-30 15:56:00,14456,yeah people who buy in a known flood area sure bare most of the cost of moving their house to high ground 
1043796,lew,2019-04-30 19:07:00,12766,"Water levels over in my corner of the Kawarthas haven't really been too bad until about a week ago but now they're starting to rise pretty fast. The water flowing thru the dams at Burleigh Falls, Young's Point & Lakefield is going very fast now and the Otonabee River is looking like the Lower Niagara. I went down to Youngs Point today and took a couple pictures but naturally they don't show what it's actually like but to take this 1st picture I was standing on a bridge and could actually feel it vibrating with all the water rushing under it.  This is the Youngs Point lock and you can see the water is about 5"" above the concrete wall where boats get tied up so probably at least 2' higher than normal.  The barge has been in the lock all winter after doing some work in the fall but if the water rises much more it'll be sitting on the concrete.     Haven't seen any homes in any real danger yet but the water is definitely starting to creep over some lawns and it sounds like we're all in for another deluge over the next few days."
1043830,AKRISONER,2019-05-01 03:55:00,5558,"If people are already on the brink, This rain storm I think is going to make the story get very very serious come Friday morning. Hope everyone is ok around here but I think for many, much will be lost. I think bracebridge specifically is in very very big trouble."
1043845,jimmer,2019-05-01 13:44:00,2730,Here are a couple of before and after photos of our shoreline. these were taken 2 weeks apart.    
1043849,crappieperchhunter,2019-05-01 14:08:00,2582,It's the highest I have seen the water in the close to 20 years we have been going to Bobcaygeon and what a change in the last 2 weeks. A bay I fish for crappie and gills had maybe 6 inches of water in it on April 15th. On the 29th it was almost up to the gravel road. A good 3 feet plus rise in water level in 2 weeks. For people close to flooding issues I hope this rain today isn't as bad as they are predicting. Thx Jimmer and Lew for the pictures to give people perspective of how it really is.
1043850,LeXXington,2019-05-01 14:42:00,1928,"I feel for all the people that are looking at there homes and the damage that it has caused by flooding. Unfortunately its a price you have to pay to live by water. Growing up on Lake Huron 30 years ago I can remember when cottages along the water got wiped out because the ice and water rose so much.  As the years went on the water dropped, and dropped...  Everyone remember the -Stop the Drop- campaign, blame Lake St Clair dredging. So, all this water was gone.. so hey build cottages and houses back close to the water for the view...  put a nice big deck close to the beach.   Last high water mark most of it was wiped out again. When you do the building plan they only require drainage based on 100 year event. They should just change that to .. your living by water its going to flood at some point."
1043877,Cando,2019-05-01 21:40:00,90,"They have to start taking more water out of some of the lakes like Canal, Balsam, ETC They have all those feeder lakes they use to control the water levels throughout the Kawarthas. They now leave more water in them for ice fishing.  Drop the levels throughout the Trent like they use to and they wouldn't have to hold back water farther north as to try not to flood more areas."
1043882,OhioFisherman,2019-05-02 00:40:00,6623,"No idea how much of this rain makes its way up north, but it is pouring here and the 10 day out look isn't sunny! https://www.cleveland19.com/weather/"
1043892,Cando,2019-05-02 03:43:00,90,"Looking at the long range here, it doesn't look as bad north compared to where you are. I hope they are right here and that they are wrong for your neck of the woods."
1043898,jimmer,2019-05-02 13:17:00,2730,"Pigeon, Buckhorn, Chemong, Mitchell, etc are dropped low in the winter, there is basically no water in front of my place on Lower Pigeon when it's frozen. If you look at the top end of the system around Kennisis and Redstone, those lakes are dropped like 6 feet or more. They have to hold back water to fill those lakes to avoid low water levels in the summer, then slowly let any extra down through the system. However, I still don't understand the problem, because it was rare to get flooding in the spring years ago.  Maybe it's the people who are managing the system???? Some say it's climate change???"
1043908,Cando,2019-05-02 18:46:00,90,"Hi Jimmer, I'm not sure of what they do in Pigeon, Buckhorn and Chemong, I just know Pigeon is not a good lake to try to teach your friend how to drive a boat lol I'd love to have my cottage on Pigeon.. But I've been going to Balsam, Mitchell and Canal lake for over 50 years  and they don't take out nearly as much water out of them. Canal Lake is actually flooded farmland they use to keep Mitchel and Balsam levels high enough to keep the Trent deep enough. At one time they use to drain Canal lake dry then restock it in the spring. We use to be able to walk right across it in the fall as my cottage is on the shallow side of the lake. Then they started leaving enough water in where the trent pathway is through the middle. Recently they have taken less water out and late last fall early winter the water was only a few feet past my shoreline. I wish I had my camera there last year in the sprig to get the perch, sunfish and crappie swimming near my firepit lol. I don't think anyone the problem. It is a combo of things is my guess. Mother nature is hard to predict and with all the cuts to the MNR over the years left unqualified people running the ship. Back in 2013 when the figured it was going to be a bad year for flooding. They rose the water level under the ice. Big mistake. They destroyed peoples docks that were there for ages and bent the crap out of peoples rail system to pull their boat up on shore I was lucky. It just twisted on section of my rail system and had to replace the dock. Others rail systems where  were pointed up on a 90 degree angle lol  Happy fishing this year!!!"
1043922,David Chong,2019-05-02 20:58:00,836,Don't you worry if they pay out guess who will be footing the bill eventually!
1043941,captpierre,2019-05-03 11:45:00,2521,Looks like water levels on Pigeon are receding somewhat.  Last year we had the same high levels and then had a brutal storm with crazy winds. That combo caused a lot of damage. Lots of wood and docks floating by afterwards  
1043942,misfish,2019-05-03 12:44:00,29133,Simcoe here looks like normal spring levels.
1043946,lew,2019-05-03 14:43:00,12766,I was  over the bridge in Youngs Point an hour ago and it looks like the level has gone down a couple inches the last couple days.....hopefully anyhoo.
1043951,jimmer,2019-05-03 16:18:00,2730,"Yeah, our shoreline was down a little when I got home from work yesterday. Hope to see a steady decline in levels."
1043958,bigbuck,2019-05-03 19:53:00,2449,Lake Rosseau is up a couple inches in the past few days. The worst is not over for Lake Muskoka.
