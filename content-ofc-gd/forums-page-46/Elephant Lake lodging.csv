Has anyone stayed at Sandy Acres resort on Elephant Lake?  I'm just wondering what the cabins are like and how the resort is in general.  Also if anyone would suggest fishing Baptiste over Elephant for fall pike and bass. Thanks!"

They are two completely different lakes and both are good at times. I think Baptiste doesn't suffer from the pressure that Elephant faces. Baptiste is bigger and deeper. I always enjoyed fishing those lakes! Haven't been in a few years now."
