1044845,GBW,2019-05-22 02:16:00,8460,"I didn't read that at all in the post.  But hell, I would have called no matter the race if it wasn't right and I SEEN it. In fact on the weekend I did call MNR on guys in Lindsay catching and keeping carp for a group photo then tossing them back in, dead, floating past me...  Those same guys were fined the night before too I was told (the guys I called about) after I called the MNR.  The woman on the tips line even told me so."
1044880,jimmer,2019-05-22 15:24:00,2730,"Like I said, I watched them for a little bit over that period and didn't see them poaching.  It was my neighbour who said they were keeping bass. I was speculating (maybe I shouldn't do that) that they were keeping over their limit of pan fish by fishing the same spot for at least 7 days in a row. I didn't want to make this a racial thing, because race doesn't make someone a poacher. So, GBW, you're saying you actually got to speak to someone at the MNR?"
1044882,AKRISONER,2019-05-22 15:32:00,5558,lol last guy i called the MNR on that was blatantly fishing the fish sanctuary at severn falls had a polish eagle on his SUV and im polish...so forget the race Bull
1044898,GBW,2019-05-22 21:51:00,8460,"Yup, the toll free number on the back of my fishing license and someone does pick up. Now, I didn't speak to the CO but the woman I spoke to said they those people dressed in the same attire were charged the night before."
1044901,Rizzo,2019-05-23 00:40:00,4754,I cant believe someone gets to fish 10 hours a day 7 days in a row! I won't get in 70 hours the entire summer!
1044908,irishfield,2019-05-23 03:06:00,26272,"Next time a CO stops to check you for a licence, ask him for a business card. I haven't met one yet that wasn't willing to do so, and/or gave me their personal cell phone number."
1044926,jimmer,2019-05-23 13:56:00,2730,"I can't believe it either, and it's not an exaggeration. It bothered the neighbour more than me because they looked like they were tied to his dock.  This is the second year that this boat was doing this.  For me to get out into the lake, I had to drive within 10 feet of them."
1044932,OhioFisherman,2019-05-23 14:52:00,6623,"That has been my experience here too Wayne, years ago I came home from work and my neighbor told me that a hunter walking the railroad tracks had shot something in my back field and came onto my property to get it. I am not anti hunting, but I am anti trespassing to hunt. I called the area fish and game official and gave him the vehicle license number of the suspect, he contacted him and warned him about trespassing and returned my call and sent me his business card, and told me any more issues? just call. Haven't had a problem since."
1044485,jimmer,2019-05-14 18:01:00,2730,"There has been a boat fishing in front of the houses in our little bay (dredged channel) with the same three guys for the last 4 or more days. They are there for 10-12 hours every day.  The neighbour said he saw them keeping all the bass they were catching (i haven't seen this). Not sure I want to approach them personally, but would the Ministry come out to check on them if they received a call?"
1044487,FishFinder17,2019-05-14 18:12:00,139,"Best bet is to always call the ministry tip line. In my experience, if they have the resources they will come investigate. As much as I wan't to protect our fisheries, to me it's not worth risking a confrontation that could end in lawsuits, injuries, etc... But I would definitely make the call if you think someone is breaking the regs"
1044488,dave524,2019-05-14 18:32:00,4508,"Call if you can confirm they are keeping bass, I wouldn't call on a neighbours say so."

1044492,misfish,2019-05-14 18:52:00,29133,Binokes and a video go along way.
1044493,glen,2019-05-14 19:06:00,2641,Just thoughts thats a lot of hours.  Are the bass really crappie.  How many fish are they catching. Catch and sell fish.
1044495,jimmer,2019-05-14 19:29:00,2730,"I don't want to go on what the neighbour is saying either, but I think he knows a bass from a crappie. My wife texted me today to say they were back and that she got their license number from the boat. I actually think they did the same thing last year. It must be awfully boring to sit in this spot for that length of time, it's like 3 feet deep and the numbers of panfish are just not there.  Can't seem them coming back every day if they are not catching. Thanks for everyone's insight."
1044496,Garnet,2019-05-14 19:51:00,2056,I have the tip line in my phone and don't let me see you poaching. Boat number no help where the are launching and vehicle plate. Nothing like losing everything. I miss Mitch.
1044497,porkpie,2019-05-14 20:36:00,2521,"Yeah I don’t go on the information of others.  If he knows the difference between a bass and a crappie then he is also probably aware of the MNRF.  You could always provide him with the tips line.  I’ve had people yell at me to stop fishing bass as I toss another crappie in the livewell.  It’s true that people poach, it’s also true that witness info is often sketchy."
1044505,Whitespinnerbait,2019-05-14 22:50:00,2038,1. I didn't know that fishing 10..12 hours a day was a cause for concern . 2. Your neighbor watches them for 12 hours a day ??? 
1044509,cisco,2019-05-14 23:43:00,597,The scenario sure does sound like black crappie. That's how they roll certain times of the year.
1044510,OhioFisherman,2019-05-14 23:48:00,6623,Is there a limit on crappies in that body of water?
1044511,Pigeontroller,2019-05-14 23:52:00,2793,CALL!  If they're not breaking the law no harm done!
1044517,BillM,2019-05-15 00:16:00,17367,"Bingo!   If they're obeying the rules, then a visit from the CO should be welcomed."
1044519,GBW,2019-05-15 00:38:00,8460,"Yup, no harm no foul there at all."
1044532,KawarthaAngler,2019-05-15 12:39:00,273,"Not everyone can identify fish accurately from a distance.  When we purchased our waterfront home 5 years ago we were down at the dock talking to the people that sold us the home.  The woman knew I was a Fisherman and said ""I've seen big trout swim by the dock"". This is on Upper Buckhorn lake. Enough said."
1044535,misfish,2019-05-15 13:31:00,29133,"Maybe it was an Atlantic,and she was confused."
1044545,jimmer,2019-05-15 15:10:00,2730,"This is why I was asking other's opinions. People do work on their lawns/yards/etc at this time of the year for the whole day, so not sitting there watching, but being aware."
1044771,David Chong,2019-05-20 18:33:00,836,"Yes, if your neighbour observed them catching bass and keeping them then he should call the MNR Hotline, they will come and investigate!"
1044774,Old Ironmaker,2019-05-20 19:46:00,8243,"I didn't have to read  the entire thread, I beg you not to confront them in any way. Even letting them see you taking a video. Let the authorities do what they are being paid for. In a case like this the Wardens would need to catch them red handed. Even with video of them doing it . Can the Crown prove beyond a reasonable doubt that was a over limit Bass being put in the boat? Are you more upset that they are fishing in your secluded spot or are you upset because they are poaching? A little of both maybe? As far as someone identifying species from a distance about 5 yrs back I had Ministry boat stop me and demanded to see our licenses and the fish. They were not in a jovial mood. Readers Digest version, someone flagged down the MNR boat who were in the area (Walleye Tourney on) and told them we were over our Walleye limit, not only we weren't over for Walleye the Salmon we caught and boxed were I.D.'d from afar by someone as Pics."
1044814,jimmer,2019-05-21 13:25:00,2730,"LOL, not my secluded spot. I don't think they exist anymore.  It's a dredged channel for poor waterfront and the only thing that would bother me is if they were poaching. Talked to the neighbour yesterday and they said it was seven days in a row. I used to let this bother me a lot, but take it in stride now.  I suggested that they call the tips line.  I think he spoke with the guys in the boat and they weren't there yesterday."
1044835,Fisherman,2019-05-21 19:39:00,7201,"Well after a week and numerous recommendations of ""what would you do"" , it appears nothing was done, makes you wonder why even bother posting it."
1044837,Old Ironmaker,2019-05-21 23:36:00,8243,He bothered posting it because he was asking for our advice. If this site was 100% fishing there wouldn't be much to read here and it would go out of business tout suite. No one want's that. Keep em cumin'.
1044842,chris.brock,2019-05-22 01:23:00,4053,"I think it's a worthwhile and topical post. The MNR is undermanned and overwhelmed. I don't think there's anything wrong with politely confronting people like this. Canada is a great place, but if you want to come here, please be grateful, respectful and play by the rules. "
