1044491,ehg,2019-05-14 18:46:00,2666,You will find longest run  on the northeast end of back channel  new weeds. 12 - 16 ft or so. Back and forth ticking new weeds with worm harnesses.
1044628,Sinker,2019-05-16 19:47:00,8692,"So, how did it go?"
1044631,chris.brock,2019-05-16 21:21:00,4053,"I fish a different Kawartha lake, but the pattern should be the same for early season. Drop back to the first bays below the fast water spawning areas and throw a medium sized, suspending minnow bait. Don't rip it, just pull it and pause, and let it hang there for awhile. 4 to 8 FOW "
1044233,captpierre,2019-05-10 01:32:00,2521,Water levels have dropped 6 inches in the last week on Pigeon. Still 12 inches above summer levels. Season opens Saturday. I always struggle in May. The June pattern of rip jigging weeds doesn’t work for me early season. What’s your approach going to be?
1044235,BillM,2019-05-10 02:10:00,17367,"I've had really good luck slow rolling spinnerbaits right off bottom in really rocky areas, say 10-17ft or so.   Sound stupid but it works (at least in the one lake I fish)"
1044236,OhioFisherman,2019-05-10 02:13:00,6623,"No clue, but  I might mix in an underspin with a baitfish style trailer or yo yo a lipless crankbait."
1044245,Sinker,2019-05-10 12:57:00,8692,"Find weeds or current and you will find fish. You know me, worm harnesses always work. 1.5mph on any new weeds I find. S."
1044246,captpierre,2019-05-10 13:21:00,2521,Based on your advice in the past I’ve done that. Got tired of pulling in 99% panfish ?
1044248,Sinker,2019-05-10 13:28:00,8692,"Theres a bit more to it than just dragging a harness at 1.5mph.  Finding weeds is really the key, and the right weeds. I've always done well on pigeon close to bobcaygeon, and south towards 3 sisters. This year they might be shallower than usual with high water, and cold temps. I was on rice on wed and its only 55 degrees, so slow and steady.  Probably still lots of fish in current areas, but I can't do the crowds in those spots.  S."
1044249,captpierre,2019-05-10 13:34:00,2521,Thanks for that Sinker. Will try again. Last year I just boated around on opening morning to see where the “crowd” was. I just saw boats at the usual spots people fish all season.
1044255,Garnet,2019-05-10 14:28:00,2056,It will take a couple weeks for the outside weedlines to rev up. I fish the inside weed and threw the middle depths. Still do well on my bucktailes.
1044260,lew,2019-05-10 15:13:00,12766,I was never much into walleye fishing but every May 24 weekend for many many years we did a trip to Quinte and always did well trolling minnow baits after dark in fairly close to shore over mud/weed flats in 10-12 FOW. Of course if your not into night fishing there's nothing else I can offer LOL
1044268,OhioFisherman,2019-05-10 16:32:00,6623,"I remember them doing that at Pointe Au Baril too, and with the number of rocks there some of the places they were doing it were places I really didn't want to be when I could see the rocks!"
1044275,MJIG,2019-05-10 19:52:00,227,A courtesy reminder to readers from outside the Kawartha Lakes area that a lot of fast-water areas downstream of dams in zone 17 remain closed (fish sanctuaries) for an extra week.  
1044276,Garnet,2019-05-10 20:11:00,2056,Kawarthas  are just ok for trolling when the weeds get up you need to be precise. About mid june the early pond weeds die off then trolling for eyes really pick up.
1044277,captpierre,2019-05-10 20:15:00,2521,"Hey MJIG, wondering how one finds out about  this last minute change?  Just looked at the 2019 MNR regs for Zone 17 and it says nothing."
1044280,MJIG,2019-05-10 20:28:00,227,"I never said anything about a last minute change, but page 129 of the PDF version of the regulations entitled “Fish Sanctuaries” for Zone 17 describes them. Ontario Fishing Regulations Summary"
1044285,captpierre,2019-05-10 20:59:00,2521,I must be missing something. In these fish sanctuaries there is no fishing until the second Saturday in May. That’s walleye opener in Zone 17.
1044286,NAW,2019-05-10 21:06:00,4022,"I'll be where the river hits the lake, in the deep hole just past the heavy current where all the sunken logs build up and steel my jigs......  25 FOW. If the eyes aint bitin"" the cats will be!   And they taste just as good IMO!  The current will be heavy this year.  Should make things interesting."
1044290,MJIG,2019-05-10 21:35:00,227,"Page 129 describes places that you cannot fish and when you cannot fish until (fish sanctuaries). For example, in the section “No fishing - January 1 to Friday after the second Saturday in May” (The second Saturday in May is May 11, and the Friday after the second Saturday in May is May 17, so all of May 17 is included in the “No fishing” period): • Pigeon River - Omemee in Emily Township, from Omemee Dam to C.N.R. bridge  "
1044294,captpierre,2019-05-10 21:38:00,2521,Right. So where do you get that there is an extra week?
1044296,MJIG,2019-05-10 22:08:00,227,There are two distinct sets of sanctuaries described on that page: 1. No fishing - January 1 to Friday before the second Saturday in May and November 16 to December 31 	2. No fishing - January 1 to Friday after the second Saturday in May and November 16 to December 31 “Friday before” and “Friday after” cannot both be describing the same Friday. Best of luck fishing. 
1044298,captpierre,2019-05-10 22:21:00,2521,OK. You are right. I think the extra week only applies to the dam at Hastings. Thanks for that. Didn’t know. Peter
1044300,porkpie,2019-05-10 22:54:00,2521,No it applies to most dams on the system and has for many many years.
1044302,Tjames09,2019-05-11 00:15:00,664,"Lots of people will be on Sturgeon and it applies to the scugog river from the Lindsay dam all the way to Ops boundary, which is way past those cement pillars everyone thinks it is. Its closer to bottom of Goose bay."
1044303,Whitespinnerbait,2019-05-11 00:29:00,2038,Shallow...
1044474,jimmer,2019-05-14 14:08:00,2730,Every Lock/Dam in the Trent System would fall under this reg I would think.
1044475,Garnet,2019-05-14 14:52:00,2056,All these boundaries are at the discretion of the area CO. The Lindsay locks has been the old train track for 40 years. And that means nothing a new CO can change it anytime.
