1044428,jimmer,2019-05-13 20:10:00,2730,"Just wondering what shaft length you have as a bow mount on an 14-15' aluminum boat? I'm looking at buying a new one and there are so many different sizes. I looked at the online suggestions, but are those measurements with someone in the boat or it being empty? I'm asking because one of the motors I'm looking at only has a 42"" shaft; I think it's too short though. Can I get everyone's opinion on the new Minn Kota electronic foot pedals. Are they giving people the same issues as the older models? I don't plan on spending over $800."
1044433,DRIFTER_016,2019-05-13 21:08:00,10439,"What is the distance from the bow to the water on your boat? Different styles of boats have different heights off the water. I would say to go with that length plus 18-24 inches. I know if I'm in water that would make my prop break the surface with that much shaft in the water I'd be looking elsewhere to fish. I have an 18' aluminium bass type boat that the original TM was 42"" I think. I got a stupid good deal on my replacement unit that has a 60"" shaft which is way more than needed. It came off a 19 foot Lund Pro-V which is much higher off the water but the price could not be ignored."
1044435,AKRISONER,2019-05-13 21:28:00,5558,jimmer that TM i sold you was on a 14 foot tinner and was far and away long enough. Pretty sure it was a 42 right?
1044437,Terry,2019-05-13 21:34:00,14456,42 to 48 works well
1044440,Musky Plug,2019-05-13 21:56:00,398,"I have a 14' aluminum. I have a 60"" on mine and works fine. It does stick up a little but not a big deal to me."
1044442,grimsbylander,2019-05-13 23:59:00,3016,"If you fish swallow you're going to want to be able to lift it right up...if you fish deep and in rough water you're going to want to stuff it deep to keep it engaged. For that boat my guess would be about the 42"" length but make sure you have the up or down travel you're looking for. Don't skimp on Ft/lbs either...in many cases aluminum boats should have more thrust than even glass boats. Happy shopping!"
1044443,OhioFisherman,2019-05-14 00:32:00,6623,"Just my opinion, but a 42 inch shaft might be ok on a john boat or low profile boat like a bass boat used in calmer waters, anything else and I would go with a 48 inch shaft minimum."
1044471,jimmer,2019-05-14 13:59:00,2730,"I guess I should just measure that one. The one I'm using is a little longer, but I think yours was longer than 42"". Thanks for all the opinions guys, it's much appreciated. Any opinions on the Minn Kota Maxxum 55lb thrust, 12v? "
1044472,jimmer,2019-05-14 14:00:00,2730,"When I used that calculation it just made the 42"", that's why I was asking if I should measure the space while I'm in the boat."
1044478,AKRISONER,2019-05-14 15:35:00,5558,"not gonna lie jimmer, im pretty sure the boat we rented in guntersville a couple of years ago had the maxxum on it and it was a total POS. better off buying a used terrova or even a fortrex off of the Bass Boat Central Forums.  on second thought it may have been an edge? either way it was trash. I wouldnt mess with anything but a fortrex, terrova or ultrex and even the ultrex has its problems."
1044479,jimmer,2019-05-14 15:47:00,2730,"Yeah, there were a lot of bad reviews for that motor. I would have to win the lottery to buy a new one of the ones you suggested. LOL I'll have to look for a used one."
1044483,AKRISONER,2019-05-14 17:44:00,5558,"http://www.bbcboards.net/forumdisplay.php?f=23  keep an eye there, I see older motorguides and kottas go for $300 USD all of the time. Jeez, i recently sold a motorguide for 300 bucks Canadian! I should bloody sell you our extra powerdrive V2 but its not mine to sell. Its just sitting doing nothing!"
1044484,jimmer,2019-05-14 17:51:00,2730,"Sold, LOL"
1044543,Rattletrap2,2019-05-15 14:53:00,1652,"Jimmer, I had the 65 lb. Maxxum 24 volt on my 17 foot Bass boat for many years. I loved that motor with the cable drive. I would gladly take it over the electronic versions any day."
1044546,Cosmos,2019-05-15 15:24:00,588,I had 45 inch shaft 55 lb thrust terrova on mine 14 footer Alumacraft
1044547,BillM,2019-05-15 15:35:00,17367,Had a 54in on our 15ft Legend.  Got it out of the water a few times on really windy days.   Can't go too long.
1044736,Old Ironmaker,2019-05-19 17:05:00,8243,"Yep, just measure from the bow of the boat to the water line. If you have any scunge on the hull you don't need to put her in the water to measure it. Add 12 to 14"". I would rather buy a used good elec. rather than a cheap new unit. Just thinking that depending where the battery will be, i.e. under the bow, it may change where the water line hits the boat at the bow. When I took the elec. off and removed the 2X12 volts with the new gas kicker on I had to put those 2 heavy batteries back up front to act as ballasts. One can tell who isn't out fishing for the opener, like moi who is posting on this beauty of a day. They are hammering the Pics and Jumbo Perch at Port Bruce, not I!!! For locations PM me."
1044770,David Chong,2019-05-20 18:26:00,836,"Really depends on the bodies of water that you're fishing as well. If you only fish smaller bodies of water where it never gets too rough then a 42"" is fine but if where you're fishing gets rough a 48-52"" would be better!"
