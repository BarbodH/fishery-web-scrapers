1045244,misfish,2019-05-31 11:34:00,29133,Thought you bought a hoover craft ?
1045247,DRIFTER_016,2019-05-31 13:56:00,10439,I did. Got the motor out of it right now. Can't get it back in until the boats finished though.
1045273,Old Ironmaker,2019-06-01 03:50:00,8243,I thought it was 31C at Whitehorse the other day. Maybe it was the wind that was 31. With the weather down here on Erie I swear there is still ice out in this lake. Stopped by a marina close by for lunch today and guys going out were dressed more for early spring or late fall. Then again there is always that guy with no shirt and shorts on fishing off the shore.

1045283,DRIFTER_016,2019-06-01 16:57:00,10439,On the South side of Great Slave the temps were pretty high. Fort Liard and Fort Smith were in the 30's. On Tuesday here it was 19C but on Wednesday we had 5cm of snow. ?
