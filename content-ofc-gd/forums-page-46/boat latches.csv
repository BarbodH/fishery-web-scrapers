1044575,AKRISONER,2019-05-15 20:08:00,5558,"hey guys, I have a broken latch on the rear deck on my boat. Ive been trying to look around online and I cannot seem to find anyone in canada that sells deck latches. Everywhere is sourced out of the states, and amazon has one for sale for 70 dollars...that cant be right for one latch?! Does anyone know where I could find them, a store would be preferable, somewhere along the 400 is even more ideal!"
1044576,Canuck,2019-05-15 20:13:00,491,"have bought from these folks for my Sea Ray.  I bought a few latches, some locking others not.  They have a few different kinds.  Not local though, but the prices were not bad (shipping is a bit high though) https://www.searay-parts.com/category-s/966.htm"

Just thinking that if boat builders are like car builders you might need an exact match for it to work properly?"

1044606,Tom S,2019-05-16 11:30:00,362,I believe you can order right off their website these days.

1044664,KraTToR,2019-05-17 13:09:00,506,"Hey bud, most of this kind of hardware is made by one or two manufacturers (Perko comes to mind).  If you can find the brand and model number, call Marine Outfitters in Kingston.  They should be able to order it and they have reasonable prices."
1044669,Lape0019,2019-05-17 14:34:00,647,"If they're perko or southco latches, they aren't cheap at all. If they are lockable, they are even more. $70.00 honestly doesn't sound that far out of the ranges I have seen in the past. I am assuming these are stainless latches and not plastic ones."
