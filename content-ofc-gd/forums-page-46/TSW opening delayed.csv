1044581,lew,2019-05-15 20:32:00,12766,I mentioned in another thread a few days ago that I couldn't see the system opening on time. Water levels are coming down but the currents are still fast. I took a drive up to Burleigh Falls yesterday and the current and high water is crazy right now.
1044583,sofabed,2019-05-15 21:38:00,119,Will that affect where you can fish on the weekend?
1044616,Gerritt,2019-05-16 16:12:00,6129,This decision doesn't surprise me at all based on seeing the water levels almost daily during my drive to work.... not sure how much more the system can take without serious flooding as a result... i would say its at or very close to its max capacity
