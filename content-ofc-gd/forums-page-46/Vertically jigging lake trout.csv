1044362,Tomcat,2019-05-12 19:20:00,395,Can anyone share their experience vertically jigging lake trout with Shimano Butterfly jigs. I will be fishing shield lakes in mid Aug. Recommended jig colours would be a bonus. Thanks in advance.

1044368,BillM,2019-05-12 21:12:00,17367,Don't bother fishing until you've marked them on the graph.   White/chartruese anything are my laker go tos.

1044403,DRIFTER_016,2019-05-13 15:36:00,10439,"As Bill says, wait until you mark them and sit right on top and have at er. Haven't used the Shimano jigs but have used other similar ones as well as Buzz Bombs with great success. Best colours are chartreuse, green/white, blue/white. FYI they can be deadly power jigging."
