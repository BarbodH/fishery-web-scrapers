1044288,mistaredone,2019-05-10 21:32:00,913,Anyone know a retailer that carries a gear lube pump that would fit a 2001 90hp mec?  I checked BP Niagara and CT with no luck.
1044289,irishfield,2019-05-10 21:35:00,26272,Princess Auto... 
1044295,mistaredone,2019-05-10 21:43:00,913,Thanks!
1044297,irishfield,2019-05-10 22:09:00,26272,This is the only one they are showing on line currently... should be one in store for 16oz bottles with multiple fittings. If they don't have a fitting that fits... just thread what comes with it onto a RTV/silicone multi step tube tip and cut to the size to fit your inlet diameter  https://www.princessauto.com/en/detail/32-oz-gear-lube-pump/A-p8780389e
1044299,Rizzo,2019-05-10 22:23:00,4754,I found out the hard way one year that some of these different outboards have a different threading...bit of a pain but at least when you find the one that fits you have it for years to come
1044305,irishfield,2019-05-11 04:14:00,26272,Like I said Roger.. just use an RTV/silicon tube tip if you come up against a thread that you can't get. That is what I use on both my 25 Honda and 9.9 merc. Thankfully I have a correct thread fitting for my Verado as it takes 1.8 litres.
1044307,AKRISONER,2019-05-11 12:41:00,5558,I still havent found one that fits my 98 yamaha TLRW130 learned the hard way that basically every outboard has a different threading. Anyone know a good source to find exactly what you need? really
1044311,porkpie,2019-05-11 13:39:00,2521,My local marina carries a rack of tip adaptors for gear lube pumps.   I’d be surprised if most marinas don’t.
1044313,Rizzo,2019-05-11 15:09:00,4754,I guess you attach that tip to your pump? Would be difficult to squeeze bottle it in from the lower hole. Or maybe if you use this set up you pour the oil in from the top? (although I was told should do it from bottom to get all air out)
1044314,irishfield,2019-05-11 17:10:00,26272,"Roger, the thread fittings that come with the cheap bottle pump fit the thread on the RTV tip. Thread it on, cut it to the diameter you need and hold it in the BOTTOM hole. Pump...  Or if you prefer, you can use a hemorrhoid cream tip!  "
1044318,Fisherman,2019-05-11 18:21:00,7201,There's no doubt that white white tip and cap is off a tube of Prep H
1044333,Rizzo,2019-05-12 11:47:00,4754,haha fortunately I don't have any of those tips lying around the house. I suppose you just want to give it a thorough cleaning before using it for its original purpose again
1044342,Chris J,2019-05-12 14:18:00,44,Yamaha dealer?
1044350,Fisherman,2019-05-12 16:45:00,7201,That's where I got mine.
1044382,irishfield,2019-05-13 01:01:00,26272,"Nah, the gear oil's a good lube!"
1044385,Mister G,2019-05-13 11:47:00,1429,Having to HOLD the plastic tip into the bottom of the lower unit drain hole kind of defeats the whole purpose of using a pump to EASILY replace the lower unit lube oil. Do a Google search and find the proper threaded end to make your maintenance a pain free experience.
1044501,mistaredone,2019-05-14 21:44:00,913,I ended up getting the pump at Princess Auto. Same one that’s on Amazon and half the price at $11
1044524,Hack_Fisherman,2019-05-15 01:03:00,720,"Not to hijack, but has anyone had the hose fit the pump handle so poorly that it falls off constantly even with “zip tie gear clamps”?! Mine won’t stay on the spigot"
1044540,yatzekcs,2019-05-15 14:09:00,3,"I got this one for my Yamaha vmax 150 from Amazon -  works well, pumps way better than Princessauto one (used that one with ""homemade"" adapter). https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B00J4YL1RE/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 8mm fits: Yamaha, Nissan, Tohatsu, small Honda's, and Mercury Japanese origin 3/8-16 fits: OMC, Mercruiser, Evinrude, Johnson, Volvo, Force, Honda 70hp and up, and Mercury US origin 24"" flexible hose easily reaches difficult to access fill plugs Patented double threaded cap fits both the quart and gallon size lubricant Ideal For Adding Fluids To Small Engines "
1044754,wallyboss,2019-05-20 02:14:00,1095,The best tip I got to get the pump to work effortlessly is to put the oil container in hot water for 15 minutes before putting the pump on it. I always had a hard time before with the pump coming apart. Because of the thick oil. Much easier now and no mess.
1044758,Old Ironmaker,2019-05-20 03:39:00,8243,"I got lucky I guess. The pump I got from a local marine dealer came with a few different tips. Hemeroid cream  tips fit some plungers. Note, don't lend it out, they are like Cd's and DVD's, they never find there way home."
