1042720,Marty,2019-04-09 14:03:00,873,"Alright folks, I haven't posted much in the last few years but I can't help myself on this one.  Never thought I'd be a Jays fan and I am trying to figure out a way to make this post fishing related so here goes.  Give some support to this kid.  He's my nephew and since I'm a moderator and have been around here since the early days, he has a blood connection to OFNC.  It's been a great ride so far and we're hoping he keeps it rolling.  If any of you attend Jays games, let me know if you're going to be at any of the games he pitches.  I'll probably be there.   Trent Thornton:  "
1042725,Headhunter,2019-04-09 15:25:00,5703,He's pitched really well so far this season. I admire how level headed he seems on the mound. Definitely a surprise for the Jays starting staff and continued success for this young man! HH
1042729,TJQ,2019-04-09 16:21:00,7806,Im rooting for him!
1042755,kickingfrog,2019-04-09 21:34:00,8333,Don't see as many high leg kicks like that anymore. Can he hit? lol  Too bad the Jays don't play the Pirates this season. I want to get to the Pirates ball park. It looks like a beaut.
1042765,Rizzo,2019-04-09 22:44:00,4754,very exciting!
1042768,Toronto_Angler,2019-04-10 00:50:00,698,You are Trents uncle?! So cool! Im a huge Jays fan and have been saying how good Trent has been this year. One of the few bright spots on the team!
1042769,colin519,2019-04-10 01:20:00,101,pretty cool. a friend of mine went to college with Shoemaker...still get a kick out of it even though i don't know these people at all. Good luck to the Jays this year and especially in 2021 I'm thinking!
1042778,Chuck Enwinde,2019-04-10 04:22:00,247,"Very cool indeed.  Now I'm going to tell my buddies I pretty much know Trent lol.  It does beg the question though, does he fish?"
1042829,glen,2019-04-10 22:11:00,2641,Good luck Trent.  Hope I see him pitch.
1042840,fishdawg,2019-04-11 01:11:00,912,Very cool Spawn of... ?  Enjoy the ride Marty. You'll need something to cheer for now given the current status of the Steelers
1043018,Jacques,2019-04-14 03:25:00,97,"I'm a Jays fan and season ticket holder.  If you're in town and need good seats for a game, hit me up.  Best of luck to Trent.  Looks like he has a great future.  You must be proud! "
