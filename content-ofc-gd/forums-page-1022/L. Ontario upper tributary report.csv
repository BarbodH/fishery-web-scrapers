208884,ehg,2008-05-31 04:50:00,2666,"Went out for a couple of hours with my buddy Dave to try for small tributary trout. Looked like a decent evening with the cloudiness and general murky feel.  My buddy likes the flyfishing but i just threw Panther Martin's. I always scoffed at flyfishing, thinking lures and livebait was more productive. But the dryflies(mayfly) were the bite this night. You could see them flying around and the trout surfacing in the pools for them. Dave caught a bunch of brookies and resident browns by matching the hatch. He said it was almost like fishing for bass with topwaters, i guess for the same visual action. Here is a couple of the fish he caught on the flies.  a nice brown   Caught a couple brookies and lil'browns as well, but the flies way outproduced the spinners. At least i caught my PB creek brookie today. It was way bigger than they usually are.  I was on a steep sandy bank, hard to steady for good photo.   cheers,  ehg"

208891,danbo,2008-05-31 09:42:00,2646,Nice fat belly on it!
208907,Sinker,2008-05-31 11:52:00,8692,NICE!!!  Love them brookies!  Sinker

209094,ehg,2008-05-31 19:40:00,2666,"Thanks for replies! Two things made yesterday's little fishing stand out for me.  One was the crash course in fly-fishing. Which looks like the way to go for shallow fishing during hatches, also was surprised at how precise a cast could be.  Secondly i was really surprised at the quality of fishing within about a half hour of downtown Toronto. I've fished for last 20 yrs+ for stream brookies and get my best stream brookie at my closest spot to Toronto.  This thing was held nearly vertical. Had to go 15 in+ it was fat. "
209098,BillM,2008-05-31 19:51:00,17367,Awesome report!!!  I got out today to a local stream thanks to some advice from a OFC'r..  One little brookie about 4inches long..  Gorgeous little fish   Water was very dirty due to the rains lastnight..  Caught him on a simple hook/worm.  Can't wait to get back there once the water clears up!
209103,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-05-31 20:02:00,0,Very nice! Congrats on your PB.I can see fly rods out producing spinning gear. More of a stealth approach and natural presentation.I would imagine the fight is also better fighting those critters on a fly rod?
209113,tbayboy,2008-05-31 20:29:00,1497,Nice stuff Eric and congrats on the PB.  One of these days I'd love to try fly fishing but I spend enough on gear as it is
209116,johnnyb,2008-05-31 20:45:00,3413,That's one nice fish!  Those brookies can be addictive --- well done
209118,mistyriver1,2008-05-31 21:06:00,600,"Good stuff, some nice looking fish.  Congrats on the PB."
209231,ehg,2008-06-01 05:10:00,2666,"Thanks for further replies. The topwater 'dryfly' flyfishing is pretty cool. It seems like you get more in tune with the surroundings, to be successful. Some folks flyfish for bass on poppers, pike on big streamers etc...Might give it as go in the future.  ehg"
209290,mikeh,2008-06-01 15:46:00,824,"congrats on your day, sounds like you had a lot of fun."
