208217,DMASSE,2008-05-29 20:09:00,420,"Hello  In Fenlon you have both Cameron Lake  above the falls and Stergeon Lake below the falls, both are great for fishing,  some of the fish there and that is open is Crappie, Blue gills, and Walleyes.  I fish alot on Cameron lake for Musky and bass when is season.  I have a cottage on the water near the Dam.  dave"
208233,GBW,2008-05-29 20:48:00,8460,"and if you wanted to head towards Coby (Coboconk) then you have Balsam Lake for some eye's.  Some of the smaller lakes in the area close the boat lanuch in the day time because the lakes are getting over fished.  Dave, how often are you up there?  I'm just North of town by 15KM.  Not sure when I'll be up next though..."
208253,Guest lundboy,2008-05-29 21:19:00,0,"Sturgeon is below the falls, and a friend of mine owns a camp there right around the corner from the falls (Wichwood).  The walleye have been insane there so far right by the bend past the falls.  Easy to get 30 in about  two hours (last week at least)."
208254,Guest lundboy,2008-05-29 21:21:00,0,"Watch out for the rock shelf on the east side about half way down the lake.... it's hard on lower units and props of new boats.  Balsam for the past few years has had some signs posted to avoid keeping Walleye,  but sturgeon does not."
208271,charlied,2008-05-29 22:00:00,584,stoney lake and clear lake is right near there.....decent walleye there.
208309,Sinker,2008-05-29 23:45:00,8692," You talking about sturgeon here........cause I've never seen this......and I'm docked on the lake. ??? I think you could be mistaken......no?  Fishing is good on Sturg though, I'd go south of Fenelon, and launch at long beach. As your coming south on #35, hang a left in cameron on Long Beach Rd. Follow it to the water, and the launch is right there. The weedline running N/S from the launch is a great spot for eye.......I get the odd crappie there too.  Sinker"
208312,DMASSE,2008-05-29 23:59:00,420,Hey   Geoff W  I am at the end of the Road on West Street.  first road past  the fenlon marina.  I am usually up there most weekends...  LUNDBOY  My Uncle owns the house right across from WHICHWOOD.  Its the Log house next to the new mansion.  The pics have been very good this year...  Dave
208341,GBW,2008-05-30 00:51:00,8460,"Hey Dave, Next time I go to the Burnt River area I'll ping ya...  Cheers..."
208381,gone_fishin,2008-05-30 02:17:00,481,"another option would be fishing near the dam in bobcaygeon, the walleye were in there pretty thick at the opener a couple weeks ago, haven't been since though."
208423,Rich,2008-05-30 03:05:00,3927,Sturgeon has both great walleye and crappie fishing this time of year. That'd be my top choice.  I cottage in the area.
208454,idesign,2008-05-30 03:38:00,149,thank you very much to all who replied.i will let u know which i choose and the results.thx
208531,idesign,2008-05-30 11:19:00,149,can any1 tell me in which zone is Fenlon Falls.I cannot figure out on the mnr map.thx for help
208537,Sinker,2008-05-30 11:39:00,8692,"zone 17  Walleye and panfish are open right now. Limit of walleye is 4 per person, only 1 can be over 18"".  Sinker"
208577,Zamboni,2008-05-30 12:57:00,235,"You mentioned picking up a ""new boat"" New Angler.....make sure you have everything necessary to pass inspection on the water and be safe. Can be expensive buying things last minute, searching samll towns for a whistle (signalling device) or whatever.  Scugog is a hike from where you will be, Sturgeon is a good place to start. Certainly don't mean this to sound negatve but you sound like a newbie-some morons can be real pr!cks at boat launches....if this is your first time launching Sunday afternoon might not be the time to learn.  I'm going to pm you links to a bunch of charts I scanned, hope you have a great summer with your new boat."
208584,jonnybass,2008-05-30 13:11:00,346,It's nice to see everyone helping this guy out. I applaud you.  (It was not too long ago that members here were slamming him because he was a noob asking questions)
208859,idesign,2008-05-31 02:19:00,149,  thx buddy for the charts.great stuff.
