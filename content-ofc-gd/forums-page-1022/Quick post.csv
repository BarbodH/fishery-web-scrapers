I`ve seen some huge carp cruising, couple of smallmouths and some suckers. Managed to catch 3 or 4 carp and a 3 suckers and my line almost got tangled up with a snapping turtle, big one too. here are couple of pics. First a 27 inch sucker lol, didnt think they grew this big but here is one  and a 30 inch carp but really really fat   Quality of the pics isnt that great it was taken with my phone, 2MP"

208876,Beats,2008-05-31 03:39:00,543,"Don't underestimate the size that suckers can reach.  Here in London,  the Thames has quite a few varieties of suckers and many of them are massive.  Lots of people mistake the big suckers for carp."
