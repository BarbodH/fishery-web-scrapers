208792,danbouck,2008-05-30 22:54:00,4380,Told my buddy that I would take him out on Sunday. I know all three but can't make up my mind.  Also can't go that far.
208815,silveradosheriff,2008-05-31 00:18:00,1025,Winds look pretty strong for LPB.
208854,Musky or Specks,2008-05-31 02:00:00,2710,Dan ifn you want pike but dont care about size. Puslinch
208860,Clampet,2008-05-31 02:19:00,1947,What about Port Dover?
208889,jediangler,2008-05-31 05:25:00,1923,"I agree with M or S, Puslinch is close to home and has pike, panfish and walleye. If the weather is bad, you'll have the whole place pretty much to yourself. Hey, that sounds too good to pass up. Maybe I'll go to Puslinch this weekend.  :thumbsup_anim:"
208960,danbouck,2008-05-31 13:44:00,4380, I'm not much of a dover fan. I'd end up sitting at my dad's the whole day.   I fish Puslinch enough. Plus I want to take the new boat out so I's rather not take it there to hit bottom. LPB is looking not too good this weekend.
208970,Marko,2008-05-31 14:05:00,854,"Didnt know there is walleye in puslinch. Fished it once on a canoe with no luck lol. Good luck wherever you decide to fish, hopefully weather clears up a little bit by sunday."
208989,jediangler,2008-05-31 14:30:00,1923,"Here's a walleye from Puslinch Marko.  It was 27"" and weighed just under 6lbs. Caught on a 1/8oz jig & grub combo. Released to be caught another day."
209012,NAC,2008-05-31 15:35:00,369,sweet fish Jedi!  I've lived in K-W area since '95 and never fished Puslinch because I thought it was all hammerhandles and crappie?!
209047,Marko,2008-05-31 17:29:00,854,"wow thats a beautifull fish Jedi, way to go man!"
