209344,johnnyb,2008-06-01 19:42:00,3413,"I just make sure the container specifies outboard motors on it.  And, of course, that it says ""lower unit gear oil"""
209349,bassfighter,2008-06-01 19:53:00,366,"Thanks Johnny b,  I travel to US twice a year and they have always amazing deals on auto stuff. At the buffalo border, there are couple of liquidator that always have deals on many items.  I always believe that same product is marketed differently and the factory charge more for different application of the same product.  Example, My mercury sable transmission fluid is the same as the power steering fluid, but the power steering fluid cost 2 .5 times more money.  Some gear oil label state, tracker gear oil , but also good for marine application, but did not state for which type of boat, for power boat or for fishing boat.  Some are slightly thicker than others, but not much."
209352,NBR,2008-06-01 20:07:00,163,For the cost of 1 change per year why would you take a chance?
209353,Billy Bob,2008-06-01 20:16:00,5865,"YES, you can use automotive gear oil for your lower unit. I have been doing it for MANY years. Same stuff just easier to get and it cost less. It will NOT hurt a thing because it's the same stuff."
209355,Sinker,2008-06-01 20:26:00,8692,Lower unit gear oil is probably the cheapest part of maintaining any boat motor.......why cheap out there?  A bottle costs like 8 bucks......and fills the bottom end 3-4 times...........I though I was a cheap dude!! LOL  Sinker
209365,forrest,2008-06-01 21:20:00,1032,what every you decide to do make sure you use the same oil type for the fill-up.
