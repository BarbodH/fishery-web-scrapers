209300,livinisfishin,2008-06-01 16:39:00,661,Hey Has anybody ever caught a perch with 4 or 5 wierd tumor like bulges on the underside of the mouth? Didnt have a camera so i couldnt get a picture. I tried figuring out the best way to describe what it looked like and tumors kinda fit the description better then anything else.
209302,livinisfishin,2008-06-01 17:07:00,661,"ok i got a pic off the net and drew in some oval shapes that represent the size and the location of the ""tumors"" on the perch    the ovals actually should have been more forward underneath the gills"
209305,Ryan Landry,2008-06-01 17:15:00,128,it's Worms.  we caught a bunch of perch in Buckhorn on the long weekend with the same problem.
209307,livinisfishin,2008-06-01 17:18:00,661,thanks looked really weird thats for sure wish i would have taken a pic
209345,bbog,2008-06-01 19:42:00,665,"Worms, most evident under the mouth and at the tail.  Perch's natural defence from being eaten (by man)"
209376,MoriaRiverMan,2008-06-01 22:35:00,314,Can u still not eat fish with worms without getting sick?
209377,Rich,2008-06-01 22:41:00,3927,"The worms cook out and are supposedly safe to eat. Personally, I don't trust it. But according to other sources, it is safe."
