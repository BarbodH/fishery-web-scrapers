According to the Guide to Eating Ontario Sportfish, the lake contains smallmouth and largemouth bass and also rockbass. Bass are not in season yet, so do I expect to be aiming for rockies?  I'll be fishing from a canoe by the way.  Any help and advice is appreciated.  Thanks"

208892,danbo,2008-05-31 09:43:00,2646,Bass is closed..
208937,Gerritt,2008-05-31 12:48:00,6129,Danbo Has it right... The lake is in Zone 15.  Bass is closed till the 4th Saturday in June. and it seems that is all that lake has in it....  Now comes the ethical part of it... Do you fish a Bass only lake during a Closed season when there is nothing else to target except rockbass?  G
