208292,jwl,2008-05-29 23:09:00,1056,"hey good luck on the mission, hope you get into some real hogs, will try my best for the team too starting Sunday morning, heading to camp Saturday night for a couple days. Wis I knew I was on the team the last few days, just got back yesterday, got a decent pike that would have made a welcome for our team.  Should be getting pretty nice out Temagami way this time of year.....go deep all the way if you are trying to find good numbers of eyes, that seems toi be the pattern at alot of places so far this season, for example this time of eyar at my trailer I generally try and fish them in like 8-9 fow , this year that pattern is a little behind and the good numbers are being caught in like 25-30 fow.  Have a ball, will wait for some pics when ya get back"

209019,Mike the Pike,2008-05-31 15:52:00,3421, What are you worried about you will be up at Lakair soon and you will have plenty of time to catch walleye in a tiller boat.If you don't catch one I sure will remind you    The pressure is on   Notice the 2 tillers in the background which perform well to produce Wall-ice
