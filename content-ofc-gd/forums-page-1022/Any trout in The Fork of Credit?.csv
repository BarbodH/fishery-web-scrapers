208481,Guest Fishing For Life,2008-05-30 04:37:00,0,"Hey guys,  one of fishermen met during the winter steelheading told me that there are trout in The Fork of The Credit.  I have never been there and have never heard of people talking about it before (please see attached map for location)  Just wanna get some information as to whether it is true or not and how good it is and what kinda setting it is. (I dont have a boat or any sort)  Thanks"
208485,Guest Fishing For Life,2008-05-30 04:39:00,0,Ooops  here is the map 
208489,Musky or Specks,2008-05-30 04:44:00,2710,"Trout are there but it is all special regs. Single barbless hook no organic bait. All fish under 19"" must be released. Please check your regs before heading out."
208493,huntervasili,2008-05-30 04:53:00,1604,"Yes there are fish, and as Musky or specs mentioned its good to check the regs as the areas vary. Also, it is a poor idea to put an exact location and map to a fishing spot and against the board rules... Good luck to you there though"
208495,Guest Fishing For Life,2008-05-30 05:03:00,0,"Single barbless hook is OK with me since I catch&release 99% of the time anyways  NO organize baits ... uhm, that might be a problem since I tend to lose lotsa hooks+leaders .. and I dont make enough $$ to keep losing flies .. damn  What kinda trout and what size should I expect? Is it like river setting?"
208497,Musky or Specks,2008-05-30 05:07:00,2710,No organic bait like minnows worms powerbait gulp alive etc. Lures with one hook or flies only. There are resident brook and brown trout it is very rare to catch one big enough to harvest.
208500,Guest Fishing For Life,2008-05-30 05:22:00,0,"Doesnt the word ""Organic"" mean something that is REAL?  It is hard to believe things like ""Powerbait"" & ""Gulp Alive"" are not allowed ...  what about Powerbait pink worms?  BTW, is it a waste of time to fish for trout at this time of the year?"
208501,danbo,2008-05-30 05:22:00,2646,It's a sensitive fishery that is well shared & protected by Trout Unlimited & CRAA. There's lots of info on their websites & Hipwader.
208502,Bojangles,2008-05-30 05:28:00,46,Ya there's some trout...        
208506,mikeymikey,2008-05-30 05:53:00,376,Fishing isn't the only good thing about that location.  It's also a great stretch of driving road too.
208508,danbo,2008-05-30 06:44:00,2646,Lots of deer around too!
208534,Musky or Specks,2008-05-30 11:36:00,2710, Definition of organic  derived from living organisms  It is some of the materials of which they are made that make them illegal. That is how it was explained to me.
208540,wallacio,2008-05-30 11:57:00,475,  Please note that the regs changed in the last few years - NO trout may be harvested (regardless of size).
208605,Guest Fishing For Life,2008-05-30 13:56:00,0,"Oh man,  That place sounds like a weirdo place after all the regs and things you guys have talked about ..  Is that the reason why people dont usually fish there?"
208609,cwood,2008-05-30 14:01:00,16,"I don't see how ""Gulp - Alive"" could be considered an organic bait. As someone mentioned, it would have to come from something that was alive and although having ""alive"" in the name is a good marketing ploy; I don't think anything it's made of could have ever wiggled off of my hook and swam away."
208623,Zubris21,2008-05-30 14:52:00,563,"The scientific definition of Organic is any material that has a carbon skeleton as it's chemical background.  With that said any living thing that you would consider for bait is organic ie, minnows, crawfish, worms, row, or even any type of plant.  As for soft plastics I can't really say if they're organic or not... I imagine the new Gulp Alive are carbon based, as it just makes sense since they're biodegradable (carbon cycle).  Sinkers, hooks, are typically pure metals or some sort of alloy which wouldn't be carbon based therefore not organic.  Flies are typically made of some sort of synthetic polymer and should be OK.  However if you have a fly tied out of deer hair or something, a stickler of a CO, may give you a hard time, but I really wouldn't worry about it much.  If you plan on going I would just avoid any sort of live and or previously alive bait, or soft plastics.  Note:  Please don't consider this a true Definition of 'organic' there term could have many different meanings, its just meant for some added info.  -fwf"
208670,Musky or Specks,2008-05-30 17:27:00,2710,I had asked the question of a CO and he said that personally he would consider any of the powerbaits etc as organic. His opinion he said though and wasnt sure it would hold up in court. Forks of the credit when it comes right down to it is essentially fly fishing only.
208685,CLofchik,2008-05-30 18:16:00,854,"Lot's of people fish the Forks, it's well known as a fly-fishing spot.  It's also very very busy on weekends, with fishermen, hikers, bird watchers, blue haired grannies complaining about everything....... It is a nice stretch of driving road, but on weekends there's usually 2-3 cruisers strictly enforcing the 40km/h limit, and it attracts large groups of overly loud Fart Machines (Harley's).  In other words it's a beautiful stretch of river with average fly-fishing only trout angling, but not exactly a peaceful afternoon.  And the coffee shop is wayyyy overpriced ($5 hot chocolate!!!!!!)"
208688,Raf,2008-05-30 18:21:00,3495,"it's a nice area but i'd leave the rods behind.  bring your gf, a camera, picnic and a box of ""good years"".  ooops.. inner voice coming out."
