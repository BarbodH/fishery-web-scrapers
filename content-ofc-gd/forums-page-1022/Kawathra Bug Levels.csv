208459,barracuda,2008-05-30 03:46:00,41,"Hey Guys,  Was hoping on doing some fishing in the Kawathra region this weekend. Can anyone tell me how the bugs are?  Was out last weekend near Ottawa and the black flies were so bad that my gf swears she'll never go back there again. Any help would be much appreciated!"
208492,Sinker,2008-05-30 04:50:00,8692,"Well, they're calling for rain.....so who knows.....that might keep them down a bit.  There will be lots of bugs still......break out the muskol and head nets.  Sinker"
208515,Big Cliff,2008-05-30 09:12:00,6899,"Our place hasn't been too bad but we are on the East shore and it has been quite windy with winds off the lake most of the time, that tends to keep them down and there isn't a lot of bush around our place."
208518,danbo,2008-05-30 09:50:00,2646,Just go without her..

208535,Sinker,2008-05-30 11:36:00,8692, Were they ever bad up there OMG!!!  Sinker
208596,Beans,2008-05-30 13:41:00,3339,I'm near the north shore of Pigeon Lake...about 10 minutes east of Bobcaygeon...  My wood guy dropped off a bush cord of firewood last evening and the bugs were out in full biting force...He couldn't get out of here fast enough and the same for me getting back in the house...pesky buggars...
208601,jwl,2008-05-30 13:47:00,1056,"don't let the bugs scare ya off of some good fishing...the black flies been pretty bad in the  Central Hastings region where I have been going, pretty much smack dab in the middle of the Kawarthas and Ottawa...2 weeks ago it was brutal, this week not too bad..but then again when the blackflies start to go away, that's when the skeeters come out...then ya get a mixed bag of blackflies bugging ya all day, then the skeeters bugging you all night"
208611,Garry2Rs,2008-05-30 14:05:00,1425,"In the Apsley to Burleigh Falls area, the Black Flies are declining, but the mosquitoes are ferocious. I've been using Deep Woods OFF and it holds them at bay. Tell the G/F to lay off the perfumed products, scented sprays etc. attract them."
208663,discophish,2008-05-30 17:08:00,392,"The blackflies last weekend in Point Au Baril and Port Loring were so bad that stripped me of my clothes and threw me in the lake.  Oh wait a sec, did I do that on my own?  I haven't seen it that bad in many years.  If you expect them to be bad in the Kawarthas, make sure you fasten yourself down with a 20 pound boat anchor tied to your ankle!  Don't let youself get carried away."
208755,Meely,2008-05-30 21:23:00,282,"Well, I just got back from a quick jaunt up to Pigeon Lake and the mosquitos were/are relentless. No mercy. I would recommend long pants/sleeved shirts and lotsa, lotsa bug spray !!   Meely"
208806,mbac31,2008-05-30 23:34:00,904, Black flies in that area are horrible. Had the Kayak out there last week and they were everywhere. Wilborforce/Harcourt area around Baptiste Lake are infested. Buy one of those cheap $10 bug hats and you will be fine. We were trout fishing there mid week and found the het to be the best peice of equipment we had.
