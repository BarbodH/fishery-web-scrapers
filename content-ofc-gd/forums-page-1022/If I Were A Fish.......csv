208680,discophish,2008-05-30 17:58:00,392,"I want to be a Stickerel ... a stick fish always gets released back to its home.  I will also have a massive contribution of lures from those who don't use powerpro.  Then I will sell the lures on Ebay, and strengthen my militia of stick fish and take over the lake to a point where an angler wouldn't even dare to cast.  Mine!  All mine!  hahahaha <evil laugh> It's a Stickerel Empire!  You hook me in the jaw, I cut you up and break your propeller."
