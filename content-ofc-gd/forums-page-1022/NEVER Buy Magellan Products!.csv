Buddy has one and still uses it to this day. Work has bought me too Garmin's and must admit, they are a way more user friendly GPS, especially the 76Csx I now have. Beauty GPS. No more Magellans for me."

(Knock on wood)  Given what is being said here it will be my last unit from them.  If I should have a problem, I certainly don't need any headaches  from their service (of lack of it) department.  I can't believe that they want change a battery for ya Carp-Starter  just because it's an older model.  If you haven't already tried them, give Radioworld a call. 1-866-666-8600 or if in Toronto call 416-667-1000.  Good luck."
