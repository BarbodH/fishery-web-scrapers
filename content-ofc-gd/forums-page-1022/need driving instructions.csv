208463,bow slayer,2008-05-30 03:50:00,1074,Looking for the easiest and quickest way to drive from London to Wasaga Beach and roughly how long a drive. I will be leaving first thing in the morning.   thanks
208467,Musky or Specks,2008-05-30 04:01:00,2710,401 east to 407east to 400 north. Exit sign for Wasaga and away you go easiest and if you push the quickest by far. The back way takes forever although its a pleasant drive.
208474,bow slayer,2008-05-30 04:23:00,1074,I was kind of hoping to avoid the 401 and 407 due to morning traffic. It should be the fastest as long as you don't hit a snag.

208488,Musky or Specks,2008-05-30 04:40:00,2710,In that case 401 east to Milton. #25 north to Hwy 9 turn east. Just before orangeville is veterans way #16 make a left follow it till a fourway intersection turn east this is still #16. Go to the lights. Proceed through the lights you are now on Hockley Valley Road. I beleive first major intersection is #27 airport rd. Take a left follow north all the way to Staynor. Make a right in Staynor onto #26 go east until you see the signs for Wasaga make a left. The popular area of the beach and the mouth of the river is at the far east on the main drag.
208617,BillM,2008-05-30 14:32:00,17367,"Why not take Rd 164 north out of London and intersect Hwy 89.  Take 89 East until Airport Rd, then north on Airport, through Cashtown Corners, through Stayner then a right into Wasaga Beach at the end of Airport Rd.  Depending on where abouts in Wasaga you are going you could take 26 east in Stayner, hit up Klondike Rd north(on your left) just past Sunnidale Corners and go into Wasaga that way.  I avoid 26 like the plague on the weekends...  Take the back way, might be a bit longer, but a lot better then 401/400/26."
