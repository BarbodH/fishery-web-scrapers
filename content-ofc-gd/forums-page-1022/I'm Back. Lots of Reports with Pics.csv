Small exude nymphs on 1/16 oz jigheads under a thill weighted slip float accounted for my full catch.  Here's my keepers that eventually made their way into beer battered puffs and into our belly's.    May 24  After re-locating to Lindsay I needed to find my brookie fix.  I got some topo maps of the area, and figured I had some good water within 30-40 mins.  Took a drive and found them pretty quickly, even found a little rainbow juvy.          May 31  Got out to a favourite lake today looking for some walleye.  Had a slow day, only 1 eye, and lots of pike.  Eventually switched over to crappie, just to get some table fare.  Looked in the shallow bays and found nothing but OOS bass.  Eventually found the crappie in about 8 feet of water and beat em up, biggest was 15 inches.        Thanks for reading.  I'm out guiding tomorrow, so look for the report"
