208049,The Urban Fisherman,2008-05-29 13:49:00,2050,"Mercer all the way...   but if I had to pick some show's - I do like Linder's Fishing Edge, and The Bass Pro's as well."
208058,Peps,2008-05-29 14:14:00,191,"Al Linder, Bob Izumi and Dave Mercer"
208063,duber,2008-05-29 14:18:00,220,To learn something - Al Linder  To get entertanied - Jimmy Houston  To get a hunger on for a shore lunch - Cronzy all the way
208076,cityfisher,2008-05-29 14:37:00,959,Al linder and Dave mercer  Somtimes Bob Izumi !
208078,TJQ,2008-05-29 14:39:00,7806,"Mercer of course... Maina of course...  Karl of course....  Red Fisher, ME!!!  BBR and Nautifish...."
208080,CLofchik,2008-05-29 14:44:00,854,"To learn local stuff, Charlie Wray.  For entertainment, Cyril Chauquet, The Fishing Adventurer."
208097,Hellfish,2008-05-29 15:30:00,308,"Mercer,Maina, bowman, Aaron Shirley and the Extreme team are entertaining lol i kinda like em all."
208108,KyleM,2008-05-29 15:50:00,218,"I really enjoy watching Leo, Ron and Owen from Fish TV.  I think my favourite would be Mark Krupa from Hooked. He brings a little more to the table then just the fishing.....the show really plays to the travel aspect and I think its a great feature.  He's crazy in his own way but its nowhere near as annoying as dimebag dipstick."
208219,Handlebarz,2008-05-29 20:13:00,3790,Shaun Rickard love the shows he does they bring it back to reality  Dave (the maniac) Mercer his show just reminds me of how I always was out there off the wall and full of fun at all times (manI need to find that again)  Jim Saric this has to be the best Musky only show out there no jumpy camera or long talks of sponsers its all about the fishing.
208348,goteeboy,2008-05-30 01:08:00,175,Son! it has to be Roland Martin. You can see his shows online.
208350,MCTFisher9120,2008-05-30 01:18:00,3761,same with Izumi
208386,Live2Fish83,2008-05-30 02:31:00,26,( hate cronzy all he does it talk about shore lunch!) but i would have to say my fav fishing hosts would have to be Mark Krupa and Dave Mercer.
208404,danc,2008-05-30 02:49:00,4677,Easy answer for me. I don't watch any fishing shows.
208414,brickNblock,2008-05-30 02:58:00,598,"Well, Saric 1st..got the vids too ..(at least 3 mybe 4..love 'Muskys 'At the next Level)  The Next Bite Lads 2nd..for info on eyes as well as musky....  Bob all the way....and, Charlie Wray is one of the best shows going IMHO...techniques/use of equipment,boat..hes got it all....just too much salmon lake trout happening for me but awesome otherwise. I dont fish bass either...but I love teh Exteme Team.....  ..for some reason I just cant turn off Chronzey...... and,,,,,and, ???????????????????/ (never Henry or Italo for sure) but.......  Petey from FNC... and..... ""Son, that what Im talking about""......cant think of his name right now but his kids show is on right on or before his???...OK Roland Martin...thats the guy.  Like Bob Mheskinomer (sp) too.......have to..got a few of his videos...(Anatomy of a musky lake and the Strike Zone) and of coarse.... Dave...got 2 of his vid's........and just generally like him in person but really dont like his shows..his vids are so much more serious without the AGAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA...INSANITY ..................  LIKE A WELL RESPECTED ...-PRO-  from this board says........  ""LEAVE THE SMILES ON SHORE""........ .....only thing I want to hear is.......""Get the net"""
208469,danbo,2008-05-30 04:12:00,2646,"Curt Gowdy on the AmericanSportsman,SpencePetros of FishingFacts, Fish Fishburne, Gadabout Gaddis & the Flying Fisherman. B.H.Red Fisher Show,"
208625,blaque,2008-05-30 14:54:00,2419,"Anyone remember Babe Winkelman? Grew up watching him and his famous polarized sunglasses lol!  Roland Martin, Never again after his shameless ""Rocket Fishing Rod"" endorsements, might be a good tool to get a kid interested in getting on the water, but what kid do you know isnt gonna just fire the rod all day instead of wait for a fish to bite.  Always glued to the TV when Lindner is on. The guy is a master when it comes to tracking Wuallice!"
208635,Rattletrap2,2008-05-30 15:21:00,1652,"All time favourite has to be the Man himself...Al Lindner! The videography and presentation of their shows combined with the excellent material are unmatched. Dan Sura and Dave Csanda add to the mix.  I do like Scott Martin Challenge (Roland's Son), Urban Outdoor Adventures with Shaun Rickard, Hank Parker's Outdoor Magazine, and of course Ol' Billy Dance . Bill Dance is just a good ol' Boy and very entertaining. He fished stocked ponds and pits and was basically an infomercial, but I always liked him.  I have tried to get into watching Dave Mercer, but just can't stand it. Way too much clowning around for me. I liked his live presentations at BPS and other shows, but this new TV show seems too ""forced humour"" for my liking. The TV spots over the holidays in the blue tux were ridiculas and played way too often as well. Anything but ""Spectacular""!  Sorrry Dave!"
208712,misfish,2008-05-30 19:05:00,29133,"I guess then,Fish Fishburn is off yer list to Mr.B. LOL I liked his show."
208734,danbouck,2008-05-30 20:12:00,4380,Cronz and Dave Mercer (but I don't get WFN anymore)
207712,Reel Nauti Pirate,2008-05-28 20:37:00,52,It seems that there are more and more new fishing shows on TV every day. The one that always grabs my attention is Fins and Skins with Henry Waszczuk I like to golf ans fish so it makes sense + I find Henry pretty entertaining.

207716,ketchenany,2008-05-28 20:51:00,3229,"What a Catch, she fishes and shows skin   I like golf too.  Hooked with Krupa isn't bad either"
207719,Fishn Technishn,2008-05-28 20:56:00,198,Charlie Wray on Fishful Thinking. Lots of info & no Bull  FT
207722,Terry,2008-05-28 21:03:00,14456,"I would never watch Henry Waszczuk after he broke the law more then once to boost ratings.... I would never watch  fishing canada,  because for the show they did acting like 12 year old punks  I would never watch Dime bag fishermen, because the seem like morons   I would watch just about any other show out there"
207751,Billy Bob,2008-05-28 22:17:00,5865,Al Linder  &  Larry Dahlberg  Red Fisher (when I need a laugh)
207756,lew,2008-05-28 22:27:00,12767,Jim Saric from Musky Hunter  Just a straight up fisherman with no unwanted glitz or foolishness like so many of todays shows.  Izumi is 2nd followed by Al Linder.
207759,misfish,2008-05-28 22:31:00,29133," Maybe we can make a show BUDDDDDYYYYYYYYYYYY.     After watching that again and again, I got the bug just a stiring."

207814,JEREMY,2008-05-29 01:17:00,300,"I would say Dave Mercer ,he is a guy that goes out and just has fun fishing.I wish there was more guys like that.With Bob Izumi second."
207819,JohnAB,2008-05-29 01:20:00,178,"Jim Saric, Dave Mercer or Pete Mania. Like those 3 the best."

The Dimestore fisherman, now I dont know how that even got aired, almost as bad as shelley and courtney for screaming."
207918,tibbs,2008-05-29 03:31:00,650,Bob Izumi and Dave Mercer.

207924,chilli,2008-05-29 03:56:00,199,Izumi but I really appreciated Lonnie King when he was on. Same reason as Lew's choice. All Fishing an No bull.
207956,wgk36,2008-05-29 11:02:00,69,can't stand Henry Waszczuk.  (fins & skins or fishing the flats) Like Dave Mercer and Pete Bowman Also like watching FWL (Walleye and Bass Tournaments)
208002,Garry2Rs,2008-05-29 12:36:00,1425,"I don't think the Best Bass fishing show ( IMHO ) is available in Canada except on DVD. Bass Pro Shop has a show called The Bass Pro's running in the US.  It is outstanding. BPS sponsored Pro's Jason Quinn, Edwin Evers, Woo Daves, Rick Clunn, Stacey King, Tim Horton and Kevin Van Dam take turns hosting the shows, which are always divided into three segments.  Each segment is on a different aspect of Bass fishing.  The pace is fast, the information solid, plugging of products is subtle, and the editing is tight. The DVD of Season One - 2007, is available at Bass Pro Shop and I recomend it. Garry2R's"
