208799,jwl,2008-05-30 23:11:00,1056,"ccmt.....if what you are doing is putting together some stuff that has to do with a tonne of different aspects about fishing.  I have a few pretty cool photos of me helping the MNR catch and tag walleye, collecting hatchery stock for a local walleye enhancement project I help with for the last couple years.   I am currently helping to raise walleye fry in a stocking pond..we  plan to net out the pond and bring the minnow sized fry to a designated area for stocking in the next couple weeks...we get little micro sized just hatched fry, kinda of the size of little mosquito wrigglers, and raise them in the pond for about 6 weeks until they get about the size of an average shiner..then they have to be removed from the pond because at this stage they are getting too big to feed on the plankton and will start to eat each other."
