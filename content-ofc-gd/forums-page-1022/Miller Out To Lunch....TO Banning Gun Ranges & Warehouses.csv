You argue points that are meaningless.  I could provide you (and have provided everyone here) with GOVERNMENT ISSUED DOCUMENTS and UN ISSUED DOCUMENTS including AGENDA 21 which clearly states their intentions and time lines, which include gun confiscation, and population reduction.  If you don't want to read them and prefer to be in denial, you are lost, and a good global citizen.  The powers love to brag, and recently they are letting the cat out of the bag for the sheeple since they know you don't pay attention anyways. Here is something that you are more likely to be able to understand since it comes from the ""Main Stream Media"" Washington Post: http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/conte...8052203380.html  Let's play devils advocate and say all of the Global takeover stuff doesn't exist.  Let's say things continue on the path that they are on right now.  Gas goes to $2.50 - $3.00/liter,  food becomes scarce or so expensive you can't afford it, and there is rioting in the streets.  You, taking the prudent advice of someone on this board stocked up  with a years worth of storable food, and a source of water.  And a ""crazy"" as you put it has desires to covet your stash of food and your wife and kids, and is armed with an illegal firearm and you aren't armed because your government took that ability away from you.  You try to call the militarized police (under control of the federal gov), but they are too busy quelling food riots and beating the heads of starving people, and the phone is down anyways.  The military is used to protect a far off nation, since they are under control of NATO.  Hmmm sounds like you have a problem and probably wished you never wanted a gun ban.  I hope it doesn't come down to what the plan entails, but at this point it is looking very likely to be."

Have you ever heard of Adolf Hitler. One the first things he did was take disarm the German people and then get them to conform to his way of thinking.  In all communist countries the government has disarmed the people and enforced the so called ""police"" and ""military"" to keep their citizens in line.  Canada like the USA is a GREAT country as we speak. However, there are MANY among us who want the government to control the people and not the people to control the government.

208607,JohnF,2008-05-30 13:57:00,3494," I disagree that everyone needs a gun of any kind in their home today, for now or the future. This is still Canada, and despite the efforts of the press to sensationalize an isolated problem usually usually involving street gangs, drug dealers, or psychopaths, we don't have to live in fear here. I think the NRA types have made an error in using old-style life insurance sales tactics (fear mongering) to support their battle for the vaunted second amendment. It's backfired on them, and we're suffering the blowback here, too, as evidenced by the kneejerk reaction on the part of some members of the public and the lawmaker/regulator/administrator types.  There are lots of potential dangers out there today in our Canadian lives - and as far as ranking them, I doubt gun incidents involving non-criminals are pretty low on the charts. Why not look for solutions that address the problem directly rather than putting bandaids on the symptoms just because the fearful public can then see something being done. It's a placebo only to shut down gun ranges, about as effective for stopping gun crimes as making everyone wear a sweater at all times to prevent the common cold. A lot of folks will feel better because something's being done and never notice that the number of colds has not really declined.  Much is made of statistics that say crime has decreased when guns are banned, but I'm reasonably certain that if a truly objective study was done in any of those countries and/or states that claim a decline in gun crimes there would be far more compelling reasons for the decline than the restrictions imposed on responsible gun owners. Unfortunately these studies always seem to come from a group or individual with a vested interest in the process. The NRA can produce just as many studies speaking to the positive effects on crime of allowing CCPs in a state as those who point to the various countries or cities that claim a decline due to a ban or severe restriction on guns. Surely there's a middle point that actually does work.  I'm a typical Canuck living in a typical Canuck town and I can honestly say that never in my life have I felt like I needed to be armed with a gun to be safe. In my 60-something years I've had occasion to use my fists (reluctantly, infrequently & long ago), once an axe to scare off a drunk brandishing a broken bottle on our Ipperwash campsite, and once a hockey stick to shorten the life of a rather large dog that knocked me off my bike and was determinedly trying to remove a piece of my 12 year old ass. Other than that I've not felt seriously threatened in my life, certainly not to the point where I wanted a gun to deal with the threat. I suppose in some instances a gun would have been handy but I was able to cope with the tools at hand.  Guns in Canada, outside the needs of the criminal element, the military and law enforcement, are for recreational use primarily, the occasional varmint eradication, and personal protection from dangerous critters for folks in some of the less developed parts of our country. I don't particularly want any vigilante protection. The police are doing just fine in my little corner of the world. I simply want to see the gun owners who act responsibly to continue to be able to enjoy their hobbies or work, whatever their needs, with as little interference from the regulators as possible, and trust that they in turn will respect the rights of those who choose to live in a world as unaffected by guns as possible. Over-regulating the law abiding gun owners will do little if anything practical to curb gun violence in our world. Criminals are notoriously bad at paying attention to the laws, and if they want guns, they'll get 'em, one way or t'uther.  If the day ever comes when I feel the need the protection of a gun, laws be damned. I'll have a gun, and so, I'm sure, will any of the rest of you. Then we'll all be criminals because of some ill-conceived reactive legislation.  That's just one man's opinion. YMMV.  JF"

208898,scuro,2008-05-31 11:15:00,386,"http://www.macleans.ca/article.jsp?content...6692&page=2 Fact Check: the ban handguns campaign David Miller is talking tough on gun violence, but do his numbers add up? Chris Selley | Apr 18, 2008 | 5:39 pm EST ""If handguns were illegal,"" Toronto Mayor David Miller told the city's Board of Trade last week, ""John O'Keefe would be alive today."" He was referring to the 42-year-old father of one caught in the crossfire outside a strip club in January, when an aggrieved customer opened fire on security guards. It happened just a few minutes' walk from where 15-year-old Jane Creba was mortally wounded by a stray bullet on Boxing Day 2005. For a safe city like Toronto, the optics are dreadful: two completely innocent pedestrians shot dead along a perfectly salubrious stretch of Yonge Street, the city's main drag, in the span of just 25 months. Both murders were allegedly committed with weapons that were, or had once been, legally owned in Canada—in the O'Keefe case, the handgun was allegedly fired by its registered owner; in the Creba case, it had been stolen from a private collection. As such, the incidents are very effective ammunition for proponents of handgun bans. ""I say it's unacceptable for so-called hobbyists and gun collectors to put innocent lives at risk,"" Miller told the Board of Trade. The majority of handguns in Canada might be smuggled across the border, he argues, but eliminating all legal ownership of handguns would shrink overall the arsenal available to hardened criminals and unstable strip club patrons alike. But to get a complete picture of the handgun problem and the solution, policymakers need to know how many so-called ""crime guns"" were once legally owned and how many were smuggled from the U.S. They're pretty much out of luck. In 2005, Miller claimed that ""about half"" of the crime guns in Toronto were stolen. It turned out that was just a very rough estimate based on anecdotal evidence from police officers. These days, the mayor claims ""one third to forty per cent of the handguns used in crime in Toronto are from domestic sources""—also a very rough estimate, a Toronto Police Service spokesman confirms. In 2002, the RCMP's National Weapons Enforcement Support found that fully 94 per cent of guns seized in Vancouver had originated in Washington State, suggesting huge regional differences in the sources of handguns. But neither NWEST nor any other branch of the RCMP has more up-to-date figures. Municipal police forces in Vancouver, Calgary, Winnipeg and Montreal were also at a loss. ""We don't speculate on those kind of numbers,"" Montreal Police Service spokesperson Mélanie Lajoie told Macleans.ca. ""We base the numbers we give out on facts and statistics."" Because so many firearms are deliberately rendered untraceable by criminals, we don't even know how many lives Miller's ban might save. According to Statistics Canada figures, 108 handguns were used in a homicide in Canada in 2006 and only 35 were recovered. Of those, the ownership status could only be determined for 20, 12 of which, or 60 per cent, had been reported stolen—much higher than Miller's estimate of a third. If the truth lies somewhere in between, it suggests that a handgun ban had the potential to save between 30 and 65 Canadian lives in 2006—that is, as long as the assailants didn't get their hands on a smuggled gun instead. It's been estimated as many as 30,000 guns flow across the 49th parallel in a given year. Even if the real figure was just a tenth of that, the enforcement gap would still be enormous. In 2006, Canadian law enforcement agencies recorded just 141 incidents of trafficking, importing or exporting restricted firearms, and laid just 72 charges. And blind luck plays a disconcertingly leading role when and if guns do get discovered, according to a 2006 report from The Tyee. Smugglers often specifically recruit mules who are unlikely to arouse suspicion, Randy Wong of the U.S.-Canadian Integrated Border Enforcement Team told the Vancouver-based online magazine. ""For whatever reason, the demand is there,"" he warned, ""and so long as that's the case, someone is going to supply it."" "

Although that is, as you explain sarcastically ""very likely"" And as mentioned, Banning guns does NOT reduce gun crimes it increases them! I am getting slightly frustrated with this useless death, here and now thing... We need enforcement. Ask any Cop worth his salt, he will tell you this: The registry looks important and used because it is automatically pulled up on its own. It is ""From its inception, I was advised not to depend on it to make decisions. It is outdated, inaccurate and completely unreliable. To make a decision at a call based on registry information would be foolish at best and deadly at worst."" Talk about local... This is from Michael Mays a former police officer in Toronto. Or how about another officers views ""Not once, however, during my career do I recall using the gun registry to solve a major crime. Simply put, the vast majority of criminals use firearms which don't come close to being included in this bureaucratic jumble of information. "" Sgt Cottingham, Alberta. I have another 100 or so with the same opinion but don't need that many to get my point across. Ok Just one more ""The reasons that the firearms registry is so highly ineffectual are, I believe obvious, but basically it affects the wrong people, law abiding citizens and not criminals."" This is from a 23 year Veteran of the OPP Ben Beatty. I don't believe many people are mre educated in this matter than those who use, well, attempt to use the Registry. Rex murphy said it best I believe when he said that the registry was a ""Billion dollar bag of perfect uselessness"" mind you it is now 2 Bil... which could have gone to enforcement and actually saved some lives rather than this banning."

Most of the facts you posted are from pre-registry days.......since then, storage laws have been added.  Show me some facts regarding how many REGISTERED, LEGAL firearms are used in crimes in Canada.

His American father, Joe Miller, died of cancer in 1960, and his English mother Joan returned with her son to Thriplow, south of Cambridge.[1] Miller spent his earliest years in England before moving to Canada with his mother in 1967. He attended Lakefield College School on a scholarship at the time Prince Andrew was a student there. [2]  Miller completed a four-year undergraduate degree at Harvard University, graduating magna cum laude in Economics in 1981. He earned a Bachelor of Laws degree from the University of Toronto Law School in 1984 and became a partner at the prominent Toronto law firm of Aird & Berlis LLP, specializing in employment, immigration law and shareholder rights.[3] He represented Toronto Islands residents in a 1985 arbitration case while an articling student, and later described this experience as his introduction to municipal politics.[4] He married fellow lawyer Jill Arthur in 1994. The pair have two children. Miller joined the New Democratic Party (NDP) in 1985, and has a picture of former NDP leader Tommy Douglas displayed on his office wall.[5]""  Does a man with the credentials and connections like Miller, make the huge bumbling mistakes and budgeting errors by accident?  Maybe.  Not mentioned is the fact that Miller denounced his party affiliation shortly after re-election, coincidentally about the same time several other Mayor's (in North America and Britain) denounced their party affiliations (Bloomberg of NY being one of them).

I'm not a gun owner or a hunter but I respect the right of those who have a legal use for guns, or at least their right to the right to have guns. There's too much over-reaction being offered as a ""solution"" without much practical thought behind it. For the same reasons that some would have guns banned one could then argue that too many other useful items should be banned as well, and that only points out the irrationality behind some of the proposals like shutting down the gun ranges. Cars, farm machinery, tobacco and liquor are just a few of the most obvious ones that come to mind. Strikes me that this fear some folks have for guns would be more realistically directed at the outlaw gun users. Identify them and you'll soon realize that even if there was a way to deprive them of their guns, they'd still find ways to abuse the law-abiding public. Taking guns away from the responsible folks will do nothing of note to reduce the number of guns in criminal hands.  To me those who call for wholesale gun elimination are placing themselves right alongside the P3TA folks who call for an all-out ban on fishing, and we know how that goes over in this crowd - it's selfish, irrational and unfair.  Everyones' energy would be better spent supporting practical solutions that stand a chance of working to reduce gun related crime, not devising bandaids that will fall off as quick as they're applied and will only penalize the law-abiding folks.

Each suicide intimately affects at least six other people. 2)A gun kept in the home is 11 times more likely to be used to commit or attempt a suicide than to be used in self-defense. 3)The dramatic increase in American youth suicide since 1960 is primarily attributable to an increase in suicide by firearms. 4)Of elderly persons who commit suicide, over 71% use guns.  From PBS http://www.pbs.org/thesilentepidemic/riskfactors/guns.html  --Firearms are the most common method of suicide by youth. This is true for both males and females, younger and older adolescents, and for all races (Kachur et al., 1995).  --The increase in the rate of youth suicide (and the number of deaths by suicide) over the past four decades is largely related to the use of firearms as a method (Boyd & Moscicki, 1986; CDC, 1986; Kachur et al., 1995).  --The most common location for the occurrence of firearm suicides by youth is the home (Brent et al., 1993).  --There is a positive association between the accessibility and availability of firearms in the home and the risk for youth suicide (Brent et al., 1993; Kellerman et al., 1992).  --The risk conferred by guns in the home is proportional to the accessibility (e.g., loaded and unsecured firearms) and the number of guns in the home (Brent et al., 1993; Kellerman et al., 1992).  --Guns in the home, particularly loaded guns, are associated with increased risk for suicide by youth, both with and without identifiable mental health problems or suicidal risk factors (Brent et al., 1993).  --If a gun is used to attempt suicide, a fatal outcome will result 78% to 90% of the time (Annest et al., 1995; Card, 1974)  --Public policy initiatives that restrict access to guns (especially handguns) are associated with a reduction of firearm suicide and suicide overall, especially among youth (Carrington et al., 1994; Loftin et al., 1991; Sloan et al., 1990)."

Hanging, poisoning, etc.  I have a bunch of info and counter arguements to all of you're other misleading citations but am in the middle of an essay and so don't at the time being have time to respond to them all.."
207442,huntervasili,2008-05-28 02:30:00,1604,"Also firearms bans in Wales, England, and Australia have also caused a huge spike in firearms crimes..."
207443,Sinker,2008-05-28 02:30:00,8692,"Scuro,  Thanks for the facts, but they don't really apply in Canada. Our gun laws are so strict its almost impossible for a child to get thier hands on a LEGALLY owned handgun.  I know if I was being robbed......my guns would be the last thing I'd think of for defense. By the time I unlocked the locked room, unlocked the gun safe, removed the trigger lock, then unlocked the ammo and loaded up......I'd already be toast.  There is absolutley no way my kids could ever gain access.  Like I said earlier.....you can ban all the guns you want, but criminals will still get them, and use them. ENFORCE strict penalties for those who use them in crime, and then maybe, and only maybe, gun related crimes will drop.  Sinker"
207260,Sinker,2008-05-27 22:36:00,8692," There is no legal hunting in Ontario with a hand gun. The only purpose for one here is to shoot people or targets. I'm totally against any more gun regulations.....it needs to start with penalties for using guns for crime. Until that happens, they can ban as many guns as they want, and nothing will change. Criminals can carry guns now, and get a slap on the wrist.....but if I have my legally owned, registered long guns in the wrong place at the wrong time......I will fry for it. What a crock of carp!! Its totally legal for me to drive my van, with an uncased, unloaded shotgun on the front seat in day light hours...........just imagine if I tried to do that thru downtown TO......  ........I'd prolly end up with a swat team on my ass!!  Sinker"

207301,Clampet,2008-05-27 23:33:00,1947," The only ones who will really put up a stink, are those who spent a good chunk o' change on handguns and associated memberships. They will be put out somewhat from their hobby. The other one's who will be upset are those who feel they need a gun to protect themselves from the gun toting villains.  And finally, the illegal gun owners, will put up the greatest fuss.  The thing is..where do illegal handguns come from?  I understand a significant number of them are stolen from law abiding permit holding citizens.  Take away that source, and what is left?"
207308,Fisherman,2008-05-27 23:43:00,7201,"It's not often I get annoyed but, you let me know when all the criminals have dropped off their illegal guns, then maybe the legal owners can do likewise and take up another sport/hobby."
207309,Gerritt,2008-05-27 23:43:00,6129,"Clamp-it you are wrong there... they are smuggled in from the US.. very few are stolen due to the tight security measures (Gun cases, Trigger Lock) we have to employ here in Canada. But that is not to say it does not happen..  G"
207314,Sinker,2008-05-27 23:56:00,8692," I'd love to see some real proof of just how many people are killed with stolen guns........or just how many registered guns are in fact stolen.  I'd be willing to bet 95% of all gun crimes are done with guns that were never registered.  I am only guessing here, so don't hold me to it.  The bottom line is if you take all the guns away, there will still be guns. If you actually punish those who use a gun for crime.....you might see a drop in gun related crimes.  Sinker"
207321,Clampet,2008-05-28 00:04:00,1947," I just knew you would say that. I would have been surprized had someone not. I agree, it's a tough call fer sure, but (within city limits) wouldn't it make sense to ban handguns even if it would inconvenience a small percentage of legal gun owners?  That way we would be inconveniencing the illegal  gun owners.  If everytime someone is found with a handgun within city limits, they get the slammer, the problem would dry up in a hurry.  That's just my feeling on the matter, and I understand that verybody has a right to feel different about it, but ultimately, aren't laws supposed to be made to protect the innocent law abbiding,honest, hard working, taxpaying citizens."
207331,Raf,2008-05-28 00:13:00,3495," united states, jamaica.  most of the illegal handguns can be traced back to these two places.  sure, some are the results of robberies but compared those two sources, it is really a small number."
