208969,Tybo,2008-05-31 13:56:00,1373,"Their is only a couple of reasons why rivets would pull out like that  The first and foremost is that the two pieces that are held together are moving in two different direction.  Aluminum boats flex alot.But how they are desiged, is so the aluminum sheet flexs betweem the riveted hard points. Leaving the alloy lax to be able to asorb shock while preventing stress on  hard points. If this happens at hard points(on the transom,where the transom is attatchted to the boat,where the the hull is riveted to the support struts,ribbing.)It is duo mostly that the rivets where not seated tight or poor design.  If this happens on rivets that hold things into the boat. Such as floors and casting decks. You are lucky the boat didn't snap in two."
208021,Pigeontroller,2008-05-29 13:08:00,2793,After some rough conditions on Lake Erie last week I just noticed these 3 rivets about ready to pop! Anyone have this happen? How'd you deal with it? Boat is an 8 year old Lund. These rivets are at the back on either side of the rear deck. 
208022,Gerritt,2008-05-29 13:10:00,6129,That does not look good Dax!!.. my guess is a bit of silicone and two large hammers.  G
208023,yellowboat,2008-05-29 13:10:00,211,Hopefully you can see them from the inside.  I would replace them.
208025,yellowboat,2008-05-29 13:11:00,211,Those are way beyond re setting them.
208027,Mike the Pike,2008-05-29 13:15:00,3421,Contact your Lund dealer this I believe is covered by a lifetime warranty.  MTP
208029,Greencoachdog,2008-05-29 13:18:00,8163,Drill them out and replace them. You'll need a setting tool and some help.    How many weeks will the boat have to be in the shop for that? It would probably be much quicker to replace them himself.
208032,Sinker,2008-05-29 13:23:00,8692,"I'd be contacting Lund fer sure!! That doesn't look good at all. Looks like the hull is bent up too? Man, I hit a shoal in mine doing 30 MPH and didn't do that much damage!!  Sinker"
208033,Pigeontroller,2008-05-29 13:26:00,2793,"I'm taking it to a Lund dealer tomorrow! The hull isn't bent at all, thats just glare from light shinning on the hull!"
208044,lew,2008-05-29 13:42:00,12767, Are they gonna get you fixed up in time for the 7th Dax ??
208047,yellowboat,2008-05-29 13:48:00,211,If time is a concearn and you are heading trought Oshawa I could have you fixed up PDQ.
208050,Guest gbfisher,2008-05-29 13:50:00,0,Life time Lund hull warrantee only covers the seems of the hull. Unfortunately you may have to pay large to get that fixed. My buddy had a 3 year old Mr pike that cost him $2800 to fix only 2 or three rivets as they had to take the whole boat apart to get at them. Lake Erie did that to his boat as well. Hope it isn't the same trouble he had.  MoeMoe from this site owns the boat now....
208055,Fish Farmer,2008-05-29 14:03:00,2234,"You better look a little closer. Under the floor. Had the same thing with my Princecraft. They shipped it back to the factory in Quebec and found 85 rivets lose or missing. Lund's are no better than any other aluminum boat. I was in Concord at Rem metal works that did warranty work on aluminum boats. The place was full of all makes including Lund's. I was told by Princecraft it was from wave action. Aluminums don't take the pounding. I owned 2 Princecrafts. I had a Lund, seen the workman ship. Thats why I don't own one. Not saying others are better. They do a lot with carpet."
208057,yellowboat,2008-05-29 14:13:00,211,Sorry Pigeontroller I cannot respond to PM's at work but to answer you question I would drill out the  discrepant rivets and replace them with new solid rivets. Can you access the inside of the rivets?
208067,jwl,2008-05-29 14:24:00,1056,"hope all gets fixed up for you no problem..if you call the dealership about the warranty issue,I am curious to see what they cover if the boat is already a few years old.   I have a Legend Viper, has a lifetime/leakproof for life warranty but I am pretty sure that warranty is for the main hull seem, and if you look at the warranty it starts off 100% coverage then gradually decreases over time to 90% then 80% and so on...good luck with the fix"
208068,Guest gbfisher,2008-05-29 14:26:00,0,They say the rivets come out more with trailer queens. I know. How ya sposed to get around that??? I leave mine in the water all year.
208109,glen,2008-05-29 15:50:00,2641,First thing i would do is try to figure out why this happened.  What stressed the hull and is there any other problems.  Then i would fix it myself.  We are right in the middle of fishing season and your boat is going to be in the shop.  NO WAY.  Can you see the rivets while your fishing?  If not keep fishing.
208116,Zamboni,2008-05-29 16:19:00,235,"Are the bunks/rollers set up well on your trailer-anything shifted and not supporting properly? Might have been the drive to Erie and not the lake.  There are blind rivets available that seal, and good transport truck repair shop could fix you up in driveway in 10 minutes. That's assuming your only problem are the few loose rivets visible. I can't see the pics-are the problem rivets below the water line? If so your flotation foam could now be water logged."
208137,Billy Bob,2008-05-29 16:51:00,5865,"Easy Roller Type trailer are notorious for hull problems because of the small area they cover. While trailering and hitting pot holes and rough roads the rollers are punching away at your boat hull.  Bunk trailers are much more haul friendly because they distribute more of the boats weight better.  With all that said if you can get to the other side of those bad rivets it wouldn't take long to replace them with two guys. Call Lund and have them FedEx you some rivets (for FREE). I am sure they will be happy to do that.  Good Luck, Bob"
208225,Zamboni,2008-05-29 20:37:00,235,If you do a search on rivets at iboats boat repair forum the recomended repair will be an all aluminum solid 'blind' rivet dipped in 3m's 5200 or gluvit. That is if your only prob is a few loose rivets-and as we mentioned try to find out the cause of these rivets working loose.  If you or a buddy has a pop rivet gun you can just drill heads off the loose rivets and work from one side.
208248,Guest lundboy,2008-05-29 21:14:00,0,If you are in a hurry contact J & J Marine in Hagersville (Don't worry they advertise on OFC).  Jim can get you fixed up quick.  http://www.jandjamarine.com
208313,Pigeontroller,2008-05-30 00:03:00,2793,"Thanks for all the advise! I took the rear deck off and as I suspected these rivets are not structural, they hold the  panel front of the rear deck in place, if the dealer can't rivet it I can always go with SS bolts of an appropriate size.  Lew, I'll be in French river country on June 7th!"
208320,outllaw,2008-05-30 00:15:00,1232,at least there not structural. they do make a good boat regardless. ive seen them pounded for years. . i was going to suggest the nascar fix. duct tape. but sheeesh im just a redneck.
208814,Pigeontroller,2008-05-31 00:15:00,2793,"I took my boat to Bay City Marine in Hamilton today, I always get treated well there and today was no exception. Doug and Clarence are class acts!  3 new rivets for $30.  7 days to Muskie opener,priceless!!!  "
208826,Guest gbfisher,2008-05-31 00:50:00,0,Good to hear. Clarence is a good salesman.
208922,forrest,2008-05-31 12:20:00,1032, What did the Lund dealer say?
