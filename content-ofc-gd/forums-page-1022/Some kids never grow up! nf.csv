209016,tbayboy,2008-05-31 15:40:00,1497,I know the guy who built the bike in the vid (well kinda know - he's married to a family friend).  In fact I went to the school he's riding at from kindergarten to grade 8.  He holds a guiness record for tallest bike (or did) and has a couple books out about doing custom bikes.
