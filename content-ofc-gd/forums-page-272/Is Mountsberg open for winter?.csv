750913,hotsky,2012-12-11 01:27:00,400,Does Mountsberg have ice fishing? or can you even still fish now before the ice comes? Bass season is done soon everywhere and if I remember correctly the sign says pike season closes November 30 even though most places in zone 16 you can fish for them till April.
750924,waterwolf,2012-12-11 02:10:00,556," conservation areas in this vacinity are quite often changing the rules and reg's depending on water levels, species catch limits, and over-all fishery limitations.Get on the phone and talk to the employees to get a good grasp on what's what.  i used to fish another conservation area close to mountsberg. of late it's hit or miss in the winter because of these fluctuations."

750935,Burtess,2012-12-11 02:39:00,901,"Ice Fishing is NOT permitted in Conservation Halton parks  Bass closed Nov. 30 as well, and I think you are correct in they prohibit fishing from Nov. 30 till bass opener in June.  Burt"
750937,hotsky,2012-12-11 02:44:00,400,Thanks^ I just did more research and yes no ice fishing or pike/bass fishing during winter. Kinda sucks ice fishing would be awesome at Mountsberg but the fish could use a brake there.
750950,waterwolf,2012-12-11 03:42:00,556,There are other fisheries close by that may open if water levels are adequate with sufficient safe ice. PM me
750984,Rich,2012-12-11 12:41:00,3927,That no ice fishing policy is what keeps a pike population there the rest of the year. However there a lot of small lakes and reservoirs on that area with relatively good ice fishing.
751071,canada414,2012-12-11 19:50:00,40,"Yup, no Ice fishing (but unfortunately that doesn't stop everyone). And moutsberg opens the third saturday in May for pike, all this is on a sign by the launch"
