817459,GBW,2013-11-08 19:36:00,8460,"Hey all.  It's been a long, LONG 2013 for me but I'm finally back.  I hope all is well and I look forward to seeing what's going on and with luck post some reports.  I just moved to Lindsay so my fishing is going to be very limited while I get set up around the new place.  But if anyone is in the area and is looking for someone to fish with PM ME please!!!  I don't know a soul in this town or where to go.  So for now I'll just work on the house...  Unless that river's holding some fish then look out I'm on my way...  It's GOOD to be back!  G"

817478,GBW,2013-11-08 21:01:00,8460,"look me up work right at the wellington st bridge, river flowing good right now I will. I plan on heading out soon and don't have OFC on my cell yet, but I will soon. I also found this old post about the area and I'm glad I did! http://ontariofishingcommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=19044 My place is SO close to the area and to find out it's closing in a week or so sucks but it's a good thing too.  It's a good thing so I didn't go out and break any laws.  Now to find a panfishing spot below the locks is the key for me..."
