815128,Ainsley,2013-10-26 13:24:00,142,Very nice! What do you use for stabailizing? I've looked into a process to stabilize knife handles but never got around to it. Have you used desert ironwood burl at all? I have a few knives in it and it makes a great durable wood.
815277,kemper,2013-10-27 03:13:00,2232,"The props are well deserved Bud, I wouldn't have said so if it weren't so.  I've been wanting to get up some pictures of recent work and since you're asking to see them here I'll add some to keep a good thread going. Thanks for allowing me to piggyback on your post and great work.  I won't elaborate too much but it is all recent and why I've been mostly absent.  The reel seat I did with T&T hardware for a T&T spey conversion using Birds Eye Maple..    The finished rod showing wraps and feather inlays.....      It's nice to see when things come full circle. Brady is indeed a talented angler and by the looks of it a talented rod builder as well. This truly is a gifted community. And am proud to be part of it.  Ps. I've seen most of what Spiel have posted...the pics don't do justice to them....I'm sure Brady's is the same way. I really like the rear wood grip on the first rod that Brady posted.  As always, awesome work!  Love the finish on those reel seats - I use the same finish on fly barrel seats, but haven't used it too much on the contoured seats. Might give it a whirl on the next batch.  Fantastic workmanship from beginning to end Brady, and to have Speils stamp of approval, life doesnt get any better then that.  Thanks - I agree!  Very nice! What do you use for stabailizing? I've looked into a process to stabilize knife handles but never got around to it. Have you used desert ironwood burl at all? I have a few knives in it and it makes a great durable wood.  Without getting into too much detail its a vacuum process and the actual stabilizing material changes depending on the wood and desired outcome.  I haven't come across that wood before but will keep my eyes open for sure"

815534,kemper,2013-10-29 13:42:00,2232,"Got a little distracted with some personal stuff this week, but such is life.  Let's carry this thread on with a rod I did back in the spring (winter?) for an OFNer Christopher.  Chris came to me with a vision - he wanted a spey rod to take out West on a trip he had planned, that would also be useful for fishing his home water like the Credit.  The budget was... lets say challenging. But who doesn't like a good challenge now and then!  After quite a bit of back and forthing, we settled on a blank (8wt, 14') and the components were ordered.  Colour scheme was to be charcoal grey blank, neon green accents (I dubbed this project the ""Nuclear Spey"")  There were some challenges:  Challenge Numero Uno - the blank showed up, and it was deep red. Oops, that isn't right. Turns out the supplier changed the colour of the finish and didn't update the website  Solution Numero Uno - Strip the blank. What? Strip the finish on a brand new blank? Yup. Knowing full well I was voiding the warranty I stripped that sucker down the the gorgeous raw graphite underneath, and promised Chris I would back the 1 year factory warranty myself.  Challenge Numero Dos - Nuclear green wraps on a black blank. Nothing to test your skills like the ultimate contrast! I'm somewhat of a perfectionist, so after much wrapping and rewrapping I solved this one as well.  Finally, Pictures:               And what did I learn from this build?  Never, ever, ever agree to strip the factory finish on a blank again. What a massive undertaking. I'm sure it could be done quickly, but it's also dead easy to knick the graphite and have the thing blow up on the first cast...    Next up is a 4wt fly rod that I built for a customer who vanished midway through the build.  The bonus? I have a sweet little 4wt in my personal collection now..."

814752,kemper,2013-10-24 14:17:00,2232,"Hey OFC,  It's been a while!  I'm still reading the forums, but haven't been posting too much.  I have however been busy adding to my already ridiculous collection of custom rods, as well as turning out a few here and there for others.  It might take a while, but I'm going to start uploading pictures to this thread of the last 5 or 6 builds. If there's interest I'll keep posting!  It would be great if any other builders out there wanted to share some pictures & stories as well, so feel free to chime in.  First up:  Blank: Batson Enterprises RX7 Switch 10'6"" 8wt Guides: ATC Titanium frame w/Zirconium Ring Accent Wood: Custom Stabilized & Turned Birdseye Maple Hardware: Batson 8.5 Shiny Gunsmoke  The wood came out the stabilizer looking like this:    After some convincing, it turned into this:    And the finished product...

He's always on the road for work and it presents him some unique fishing opportunities - in this case Atlantic Salmon on the East Coast.  This rod doesn't fit my personal style - too flashy for me but it isn't my rod, and it's exactly my buddy wanted so I built it to spec.

Instead, here's a few that are in process -  I was lucky enough to come across two early 1990's Fenwick glass fly blanks in the spring. A 5wt and a 6wt, both 7'6"".  I was even more lucky when they were brand new in original packaging, and available for the price of $10 each!  I don't have great quality pictures of these ones just yet, but I'll get some better ones tonight.  The 5wt is finished:     Matching Handles in process:    Test wraps on the 5wt - notice the guides are from the same vintage, picked up a lifetime supply of those at the same place I found the blanks!

I've been wanting to get a post up for weeks of some work but I just can't seem to find the time, hopefully soon.  A great compliment coming from you - thanks!  Add some pictures into this post, would be great to see a bunch of builders different styles.   Beautiful!  Love the bird's eye maple!  Thanks - I wasn't sure until I stabilized it with a very slight dye, and turned it down that it was the right choice. Has a look similar to the golden amboyna but more subdued.  The ability to stabilize my own woods had changed the game for me, what used to cost $50 for one or two rods worth now costs about $5 and the selection is endless.  Nice stuff man.  Can you provide any info on the reel manufacturer? I'm looking for a new reel and good quality at a reasonable price gets my interest.  The manufacturer is called Risen Fly.  Website is here: http://www.risenfly.com/  If you want to PM me, I'd be more than happy to save you a few bucks and bring a reel in for you in my next order.  Cheers,  Kemper"
