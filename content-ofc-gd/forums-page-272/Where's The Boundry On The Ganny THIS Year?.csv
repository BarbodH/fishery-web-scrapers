816855,Photoz,2013-11-05 09:55:00,792,"I know there is usually a discussion about this once or twice a year, and I just go to my trusty regulations book and check. Plus I believe Ron put a Ministry sign up on the south sside of the trestle a couple years back. Well the sign is gone, and I don't have my trusty Rules & Regulations book now. Most of the locals are standing on the north side and casting into what I believe to be hallowed water, but they say it changed again this year. Even though the fishin' is LOUSY this year, I don't wish to get nailed for fishing in a sanctuary. Would someone who has a regulations book advise me on wgere the boundary id THIS year. Thank you kindly. Although I haven't seen a Ministry rep there in a couple years, the first cast I'd make on the north side, he'd likely choose to show up, and it WOULD be hallowed waters!"
816866,MJL,2013-11-05 12:10:00,2427,Year round fishing = CNR rail down to Lake Ontario  Extended season fishing (4th Saturday in April to December 31) = South side of CPR bridge to Lake Ontario  General trout/salmon season (4th Saturday in April to Sept 30) = Whole river is open except from 401 to Jocelyn st bridge.  Year round Sanctuary = 401 to Jocelyn st bridge  The regulations for the Ganny can be seen online here: http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/stdprodconsume/groups/lr/@mnr/@letsfish/documents/document/mnr_e001336.pdf  The general regulations as well as the ones for each zone can be seen here: http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/en/business/LetsFish/Publication/STEL02_163615.html
816990,chessy,2013-11-05 23:20:00,610,MJL your close .. the year round fishing is the southerly limits of the cnr right of way.. last year the pin (servey stake was dug up )  no fishing under the bridge at all for trout and salmon

(Possibilities are pretty small, I haven't seen the Ministry ANYWHERE down there in about  a year or more! Presently the trout aren't hitting AT ALL in the Ganny . . . .    from 06:00 to 2:00 p. m. I saw 2 fish caught, my float went down ONCE . . . .   missed him!"

As far back as I can remember (started fishing there in the 80's) the only ""open all year section"" has been from the South side of the bridge to the lake. The section above the bridge closed at the end of September."
