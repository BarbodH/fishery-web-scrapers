816273,Tim Mills,2013-11-02 02:52:00,476,My son and I went on a 3 day Camping and Fishing Trip in the Loring area.  It was cold and rainy and the fishing could have been better but it was an enjoyable trip.  Reilly portaging in.    We spent alot of time under the tarp.   Island Campsite   We caught a wide variety of small fish but good sized fish were few and far between.  We each lost a decent SMB.   Our boat and motor worked well.     Until I ran over my son's 50lb braid.     Fortunately my son caught a decent pike on the way out.     When you tell your son that the fishing is excellent and the portaging will be worth it you feel a bit of pressure.  Luckily one good fish can make a trip.    We weren't the only ones using the portage trail.        Our last portage on the way out

816391,leaf4,2013-11-02 18:05:00,2466,What kind of seats are those you have in you canoe? I've got a scanoe and need to start looking at some options for next season sitting with the knees bunched up gets old real fast for a a lot of people lol
816392,davey buoy,2013-11-02 18:10:00,5505,Great trip !!!!!Thank goodness you didn't meet up with who owned those footprints.!!
816396,kickingfrog,2013-11-02 18:39:00,8333,"Great trip.  Awesome!I can't wait till my son is old enough to do that.  I'm afraid that by the time mine gets old enough I will be too old to be willing to sleep on the ground. I'm almost ""there"" now."
816406,Tim Mills,2013-11-02 20:40:00,476,"What kind of seats are those you have in you canoe? I've got a scanoe and need to start looking at some options for next season sitting with the knees bunched up gets old real fast for a a lot of people lol  Thanks for the comments.  I bought the seats and swivel bases at SAIL, the seats were $38 each. The rear seat and motor are a tight squeeze in a  Scanoe but it was a good deal and it does the job.  I also use the seats in a Coleman Crawdad which is more stable but has less cargo capacity.  "
816416,Steve,2013-11-02 21:22:00,2075,"that portage brings back memories.  my father took me through those chains of lakes (including starting from that exact location you end your photo's with) when I was all of 8 years old. As I grew and the years went by, we would go deeper and deeper into those lakes, adding a lake or two a year. During those days, the mid to late 80's, the pike fishing was fantastic. Fish up to 8lbs were quite common in those small back lakes. The bass fishing wasn't too shabby either. We went back again when I was 15 and the fishing was much tougher. The portages were cut much cleaner, and a hunting lodge was on one of the main portage lakes.  thanks for showing those photo's. I camped on that exact same island.  great to see fathers still taking their sons back there....25 years after my dad and I did it..."
816445,Ron,2013-11-02 23:05:00,1683,"Right on,  Trips like that are most enjoyable, especially with your kids.  Water looks a little on the chilly side. (re ice along side the canoe in the one pic).  Cheers, Ron..."
816617,pidge,2013-11-03 23:10:00,438,Very cool report. Enjoyed the read thanks. Musta been some chilly at night up there at night.  Outta curiosity what did you guys use to keep warm at night? I usuall suffer lol. What were the prints of? Cat?

817350,bigugli,2013-11-08 01:44:00,6138,Looks like a great father and son outing.
817352,Steelheadphycho,2013-11-08 01:51:00,470,I've been taking my boy to grandpa's island on memesagmessing in the loring area since he was 5. He is 13 now and still loves it like he did then. We would camp on the island with my brothers and spend all day fishing. The greatest times of my life. The reason I love visiting your wonderful country. Thanks for the memories!
817455,Jds63,2013-11-08 18:48:00,1365,"Wow , I too recognised the island campsite and that portage, that was nearly 15 yrs ago for us.  Good to see that some decent fish were caught ..."
