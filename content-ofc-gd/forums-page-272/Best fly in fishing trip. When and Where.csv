I've seen some amazing fishing trips posted here.  Looking for some opinions on where and what time of year.  A few of the trips he was looking at were $10,000 per person.  Thanks for any help.

817746,Musky or Specks,2013-11-10 15:47:00,2710,"Man my trips in Order would be for very exotic destinations. Taimen fishing in Mongolia. Golden Dorado in Bolivia would be my top two choices. Staying in Canada, Plummers with the outpost at the tree river for char and then finally Sutton River for Brook trout. Times of the year its best to ask an outfitter. GTS."

817760,Musky or Specks,2013-11-10 17:47:00,2710,Definetaley want to stay in Canada though Then Plummers for sure with half the time at the tree river outpost for char. Huge lake trout and pike. Artic Grayling and massive char.  http://www.plummerslodges.com/
817762,DRIFTER_016,2013-11-10 18:06:00,10439,"Then Plummers for sure with half the time at the tree river outpost for char. Huge lake trout and pike. Artic Grayling and massive char.  http://www.plummerslodges.com/  Yep. I spent 15 years guiding up @ Great Bear. There is some good pike fishing and great fishing for lakers and grayling. The Tree River outpost has world record Char. If you want coloured up char and a chance at some schooled up spawning lakers go in August. If you want silver char and shallow water lakers (as shallow as 18"") go in early July. One caution is that early season can be hit and miss due to ice limiting traveling. You have better grayling fishing later in the season as the water warms up as well.  If you want to go to the Tree you will have to stay @ the main lodge as the trip is run out of there. If you want better pike fishing stay at Trophy Lodge. You can still fish char out of here but it is on the Coppermine river. The fish are smaller but there are more of them. Tree River is an overnight trip while Coppermine is a long day trip.  Out of Trophy there is a fly out to the Anderson river which is pretty cool. There are usually tons of whitefish, lakers and grayling here, but the main interest is in the inconnu that hit the river to spawn starting in late July.  There is a stupendous fly out for grayling out of the main lodge.  Both lodges have the ability to produce 60+ pound trout at any time during the season.  Like this one.  "
817774,lovetofish,2013-11-10 20:33:00,500, I would love to fish for post spawn pike and lakers. Not sure when the ice goes out up there
817778,kuhaman,2013-11-10 20:37:00,503,East coast tuna fishing or fraser river sturgeon fishing. Closer to home my choice would be Kesagami.
817780,DRIFTER_016,2013-11-10 21:23:00,10439,i  I would love to fish for post spawn pike and lakers. Not sure when the ice goes out up there  Ice usually goes out the 1st week of July but have seen bad pack ice as late as the 3rd week. One year we had to fly people out to open water for the first 2 weeks of July. If you want to fish the early season the safest bet is the second week of July.

Any idea which lodge we have to go to to get to whitefish river  The Whitefish River is out of Trophy Lodge. It's at the head of Bydand Bay. The river mouth has shallow edges that drop off into 20-30 fee mid channel. Lots of good piking there. There is also the Pike River that is closer to the lodge. No big ones in there but lots of smaller guys. This spot can save the day when it's too gnarly to hit the main lake.  "

With char in the mix I'd stick to August but if wanting a better laker experience I'd like to try July.  Plummers Trophy Lodge would be awesome to try too.  I have a short ""big trip"" bucketlist for the moment that includes Ungava for atlantics and char, Sutton specks, Athabasca lakers & pike, Great Slave lakers & pike, Costa Rica for tarpon, and Panama for roosters and bills.  As far as Ontario goes, would simply like to see more stretches of the Attawapiskat & Nipigon."

If I could ""go anywhere"", it would probably be up to Scott Lake Lodge...60th parallel...northern Sask. The whole package is first class.

817939,timmeh,2013-11-11 21:30:00,609,"You mentioned staying in Canada, but if you expand that to the US there is some incredible saltwater fishing. A place like the Florida Keys you could find nice, safe places to stay and familair food (nothing to exotic if that's what you want to avoid). There are many different trips to take to target things like marlin, giant grouper, sharks, cuda, tarpon, stuff you can't find anywhere near home. Maybe it's not what you're looking for but thought I'd mention it."
