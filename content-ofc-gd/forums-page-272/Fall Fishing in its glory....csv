816242,RJackson,2013-11-02 00:26:00,113,"September was a pretty wild display of Eastern Ontario fishing but I think October may have trumped it!Hosting our first BIG BASS Megabucks took up some of our time but in the end it was worth every second.  The reviews from the anglers have us convinced they loved the format, the payout and most of all the fishing.  Big Rideau Lake was rockin'.  The final hour of the day saw 6 4 lb plus fish brought to the scales.  Cash and prizes in the $10,000 range were handed out to the winners.  This will be an annual event so watch for it if you hope to fish next year as the field will be limited again.Some pics of the day...Full report of the day with loads of pics and results are here: http://www.rjnbirdeesoutdooradventures.ca/?p=1311Fall time is Smallie Time.  BIG TIME.Enjoyed some great days on the Smalljaws!  Drop Shotted Jackall CrossTail Shad in Green Pumpkin and Tubes whacked em all month long!Full Smallie report is here:  http://www.rjnbirdeesoutdooradventures.ca/?p=1306Spent one morning in the Duck blind with my buddy Luke and Duke.  I had never done that before and watching Duke work was a treat!More Duck Hunting shots: http://www.rjnbirdeesoutdooradventures.ca/?p=1296Lastly was our return trip to LSC.  That place is nuts and I love it.  Added a few to our crew this year with Grant, Tony and Pat joining us that just added to the fun.Doubleheader...
