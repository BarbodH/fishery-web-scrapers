817850,Terry,2013-11-11 02:39:00,14456,first thing many do is throw the arm out and put on a piece of foam
817853,Sinker,2013-11-11 03:14:00,8692,Yup!
817863,redpearl99,2013-11-11 05:03:00,259,"The salesman is dead wrong, lol.   can you explain why he's wrong?  the graph models have dual beams of 20 and 60 degrees while the ice 35 flasher and some marcums can shoot a much narrower degree beam and can therefore pick up much better detail (hence why the graph models have a 2.5 inch target separation while the flashers have 0.5 inch)"
817876,porkpie,2013-11-11 11:33:00,2521,"To answer your questions as to why I liked the marcum, well I own one, it has been good to me, I've never needed a dual beam, as I haven't had issues shallow or deep, and you asked about flashers specifically.  Nothing to do with hype, and I know nothing about the humminbird flashers, but I do own one of their colour graph/gps units and have been very happy with the performance."
817885,BillM,2013-11-11 14:12:00,17367,"  can you explain why he's wrong?  the graph models have dual beams of 20 and 60 degrees while the ice 35 flasher and some marcums can shoot a much narrower degree beam and can therefore pick up much better detail (hence why the graph models have a 2.5 inch target separation while the flashers have 0.5 inch)  I could see if you're fishing 5ft of water, but target separation of less then 2 inches in anything over 10ft will make zero difference.    The graph is an easy choice for someone who's never iced fished before.  Let alone the wider beams on the graphs which will allow you to see fish come into the zone way before a flasher will..    When you're fishing deep for lakers/whities, this is a huge advantage of a graph.   Then you've also the advantage of using the graph in the summer time off a boat or similar..... can't do that with a flasher.."
817886,SirCranksalot,2013-11-11 14:17:00,3291,which is a good intro graph unit you would recommend?  just a regular portable humminbird with an ice transducer ?  How essential is an ice transducer? I was out on Simcoe at 100 ft last year with a friend. He had a fairly basic Humminbird with a reg transducer. He could see his jig/lure.

The ice transducer is way more convenient when you're hopping from hole to hole...Drop it in and you're done.

Well worth the $$$.  Drop it in and go."
817905,SirCranksalot,2013-11-11 15:57:00,3291,"He had a piece of foam wrapped around the cable, so he could just drop it in as well.(Once the foam was adjusted for the ice thickness, which was easy to do)"

Nothing to rig up, just drop it in and go, it will always sit properly in the water."
817914,kevin booth,2013-11-11 17:17:00,57,"the best advice for ice fishing alone is to go buy any vexilar and be done with it,forget the rest if its just for ice fishing you will be all set and double your fun and sucess,"

817544,redpearl99,2013-11-09 03:07:00,259,Im thinking of getting my first flasher this winter and wanted your opinions on some models.  Not really looking for anything with all the bells and whistles.  I mostly fish in smaller lakes up to 50ft.  so far I'm looking at the following:  - Hummingbird Ice-35 ($310)- http://www.basspro.com/Humminbird-ICE35-Portable-Flasher/product/102293/  - Marcum VX-1Pro ($330) - http://www.basspro.com/MarCum-VX1Pro-Ice-Sonar-System/product/1109190413/  I was also wondering if you know of any portable fish finders that can also convert into a flasher.  Perhaps then I could use the same system year round. 
817546,irishfield,2013-11-09 03:12:00,26272,My 102C has a flasher mode... other than to turn it on and wonder why or how people use it.. it sees no use. Graph all the way for me..
817548,MJL,2013-11-09 03:15:00,2427,I use a Humminbird 345C...I love it and can't imagine ice fishing without it. I always use it in graph mode but it also has a flasher type screen with the circular set-up. 
817550,redpearl99,2013-11-09 03:31:00,259,is graph mode what's on a regular fishing finder?
817553,GBW,2013-11-09 03:35:00,8460,"Not really looking for anything with all the bells and whistles.  I mostly fish in smaller lakes up to 50ft. you just said it right there the reason you don't NEED a flasher...  lakes up to 50'.  Why spend unless you want the toy when you don't have to?  Based on the 50' comment you don't have to.  Use anything.  When fishing deeper water for lakers and so forth then a flasher can be very handy to see the depth and so forth but not needed in my mind based on your OP.  Now if you want to get one and invite me to go test it with ya, I'm all for it!  G"
817563,BillM,2013-11-09 04:42:00,17367,Buy a graph.....
817572,porkpie,2013-11-09 09:52:00,2521,"Try one out sometime.  You will be absolutely amazed at the info it will provide you.  OP, I have an original VX1 that was rebranded for gander mountain.  I bought it in 2005 and it has been an amazing unit, and done all I have needed it to.  I'm sure the adjustable  zoom would be even better on the 3 series, but I mainly fish for bottom dwellers, so I get by just fine!"
817585,redpearl99,2013-11-09 13:27:00,259,which is a good intro graph unit you would recommend?  just a regular portable humminbird with an ice transducer ?
817605,esoxcrazy,2013-11-09 16:30:00,22,The price point on the new vexilar smartphone transducer is worth a look.  New technology is gonna change the big guys I'm sure.  Totally worth a look.
817606,Sinker,2013-11-09 16:33:00,8692,"I really like having the GPS on my graph as well. I have no use for a flasher. A graph marks the exact same fish, in real time, and you can use it all year round. I can mark my jig perfectly in any depth I've fished....up to 120ft....no problem.  S."
817607,Terry,2013-11-09 16:39:00,14456,"The price point on the new vexilar smartphone transducer is worth a look.  New technology is gonna change the big guys I'm sure.  Totally worth a look. at 150  bucks it is interesting  but with wifi there is an inherent delay, so no real time however it is good to see vexilar going to a graph"
817609,Joeytier,2013-11-09 17:16:00,3990,"Between the two flashers, definitely the marcum.  Great little unit."
817613,jdmls,2013-11-09 17:36:00,575,I recommend u buy the ice 45 over the 35...  the digital read out screen is what makes the hummingbird ice series what it is..
817647,redpearl99,2013-11-09 21:20:00,259,what you think about the PiranhaMAX 196ci PT?
817648,Fisherpete,2013-11-09 21:27:00,1814,Pm sent
817649,Terry,2013-11-09 21:27:00,14456,I would buy  a used 67c-ice  or others

A wee bit slower then real time, but nothing to lose sleep over."
817739,redpearl99,2013-11-10 14:57:00,259,I appreciate that some of you are telling me to get a graph.  But can someone please recommend a specific introductory graph unit.  Am I supposed to just get the  PiranhaMAX 196ci PT and an ice transducer????
817745,Sinker,2013-11-10 15:42:00,8692,I'd look at the Lowrance Elite series myself. The Elite 4 is a great unit on the ice.  S.

817787,redpearl99,2013-11-10 22:12:00,259,"So I went to sail today and checked out some of their fish finders and flashers.  I was talking to the guy about the Marcum vx-1 pro, and he said it was a great unit, but he said it only has a single beam transducer.  In comparison, the Humminbird ice 35 has a dual beam transducer and is good for shallow as well as deep lake fishing.  So I was wondering why some of you recommend the Marcum over the humminbird?  is it based just on the Marcum hype?"
817844,BillM,2013-11-11 02:08:00,17367,So which graphs did you look at?
817848,redpearl99,2013-11-11 02:29:00,259,"I forget the model number but i think i looked at the 345ci or something like that.  The sonar salesman also suggested getting a flasher rather than a graph because the flasher as much better detail / target sepertion.  Right now im leaning towards the Ice 35 as it has dual beam sonar (9 and 19 degrees) while the marcum vx-1 only as a single 20 degree beam.  The benefit of the marcum is the swing out arm and the fact that it comes with a carrying case.  The humminbird carrying case costs $40 extra.  I am also debating whether to get the ice 45, but I've been reading that the LCD back lit screen causes major battery drain (battery is done after 7 hrs).  The humminbird also has a much better zoom function it seems.  It doesnt split the flasher into two screens, instead it just zooms in and out of the target zoom area."
817849,BillM,2013-11-11 02:31:00,17367,"The salesman is dead wrong, lol."
