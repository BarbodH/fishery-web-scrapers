817338,Garnet,2013-11-08 00:11:00,2056,You sign a document when you see a FA. They will have a very fancy name to qualify you for risk.  This is a legal document and they can't put you in anything above the stated risk tolerances.  You likely signed for very low risk.  If this is the case 5% is doing very well.

""Unless you don't plan on living very long inflation will get you. Even with indexing it probably won't keep up""    Yes inflation will get you but the big secret and it's no secret at all is your lifestyle will change as you age.  Lets go back to 20 years ago. I'm 59 on a pension from the plant for 13 years, 25 and out deal.  Regularly went to ball games with the gang, any outing to Toronto or Buffalo was a minimum of $200.00, not including tickets, went to a few World Series games and went to the Superbowl many times when in Florida, don't even go to a Ti-Cat game now, been there done that.  Weekly the boys from work or the regular crew traditionally went out for drinks and dinner, $200.00 a pop, not including stopping at the bar for an hour a few more times a week, been there done that.  A few times a week for dinner and or lunches on dates, or with my now wife, done with that, would rather be on the deck at the lake BBQ ing. We do try to get out in the fall and winter at least once a week, maybe, not because of cost we'd rather be home.  Had a 4 bed, 3 bath home and the cottage we entertained at regularly, or every weekend at the lake, minimum $200.00 for a BBQ at the lake sometimes $500.00 for the weekend, same at home with overnight  friends poolside, we are all the same age, we do get together but everyone wants to host now, everyone likes to stay close to home at our age.  Been there done that.  Downsized from that McMansion, remodeled the cottage and moved in the year I retired. From 3800 ftsq to 1250 ftsq. Been there done that.  No mortgage, big difference not shelling out a grand plus big taxes, plus utilities for 3 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms no one used oh, and the finished lower level, all that empty space no one used but holidays and a few weekends a year.  When working drove a Benz, BMW and Cadillac , now it's Chevy, Ford, or Nissan. Had Armani in the closet, now it's Moores. Been there done that.  Boat and toys all purchased and paid for now, not 20 years ago.  Was a member at a Golf and Country Club and all the fees that go with it, now it's a semi-private course. I can shower at home as well as wait until we come back here for the 19th hole or at someone's place instead of staying for 3 hours for pop's and meet the wives for dinner at the club. $300.00 a month beverage fee, plus. We still stay for one or two and have a DD to support the course but the beers always better on the deck plus we have a better view of the lake.  Man I could go on and on, it's just getting a bit older and you just find yourself not spending as much. The quality of life retired isn't lesser because one can't afford it, it is just different and works out to be less costly than when working, it's just different needs and wants. It's mindset not net worth.  I give a simple analogy. When I was working up to 12 hours a day and on call the rest if I needed a new wheelbarrow I stopped at CTC and asked where the wheelbarrows were? Paid to have it assembled by the guy, went up to the cashier and then asked how much? Now I have the time to hunt around for a good deal, go out and pick one up on sale, have the time to put it together and the time to use it. When I was able bodied and working all those stupid hours I usually had a company do both places unless I was on vacation or had an extra 3 hours, yea right.  Now I have time to do it and enjoy it usually. There's another few hundred a month. That's actually something I miss, having someone cut the grass. I still won't shovel or snowblow, if I have to go out and get a job to pay for it I will have a guy come here and do the snow.  You will be surprised, I took a very early pension. If I stayed 10 more years I would be dead by now. I haven't missed a meal and can say I honestly don't miss the money. I golf, fish, vacation (usually at home when my wifes off), enjoy myself a heck of a lot more at 50% of the wages I made. It would have worked out to only about 1% more per annum for every year I stayed past 27.5.  You just won't spend what you don't have and will be surprised at what you longer need that you thought you couldn't live without.  I watch the Super Bowl at home now with friends on the paid for big screen and surround sound, that is if you can pry those friends from their homes now.  As far as paying off a mortgage that's up for debate. I don't have any children as a legacy, my assets will go to my wife as well as 70% of my pension, if I life insure a line of credit I do like the idea of using cash paying 3% on a line of credit  earning me a return of 12% or more in real estate. I knew a very successful business man that once owned an airline, we are talking big money here. He said if a business man doesn't go bankrupt at least twice I his life he wasn't doing very well? When asked to explain he said if I owe 10 million for fuel to Esso and I do, why shouldn't I pay them 10 cents on the dollar? Not every venture is a success, this is one, we do something else tomorrow. Didn't Trump declare bankruptcy once at least. So why pay off a mortgage? Basically not using that money to make more isn't a good plan."

The other is a wide open investment which I can play with. Please tell what I've done wrong.  That is pretty much what I have done. I retired at 58 and have lived the last 5 years basically off the company pension. I also have a good sized RRSP that continues to grow until it is actually needed. Oh , started the Retirement Savings in my late 20's  weekly deduction, bought the house in 84 when it was worth a 1/4 of what it is now. I had planned to be further ahead that what I am now. but I retired May 2008  , probably the worst month of the last 50 years to retire."
817733,Old Ironmaker,2013-11-10 13:26:00,8243,"Dave maybe not the best month to retire but any month you retire is a good one. Good for you. I did have a business up to 3 years ago, no one says because you have a business it makes you money, now it's my pension only, but my wife does work full time and is doing well at it. That really helps.  It's the first time my spouse earned more than me, I always looked at it the old fashioned way, man make money, wife cook and clean, sort of. I got used to this paradigm shift quickly. Your story sounds very familiar."
814543,mike rousseau,2013-10-23 16:08:00,4661,Hello...  Just wondering if any of our regulars here are financial advisors in Ontario... I have a couple quick questions I'd love to ask VIA PM...  I'd really appreciate the help...  Thanks
814580,Garnet,2013-10-23 20:38:00,2056,"Financial Advisers are mostly salesman with there welling being #1.  Bank Financial Advisers again are trying to make banks money but are ok if you know the right ? to ask.  Fee for advise are probably best but they are getting there income for advise and are expensive.  DYI  ""DO Yourself Investor"" takes a lot of study and time."
814595,Big Cliff,2013-10-23 21:24:00,6899,"Had a financial advisor once, a friend of my wifes who knew everything about investing. Cost us a lot of money then I decided to cut my losses and do it myself. Here is what I learned in a nutshell:  Realestate can be a good investment if you are smart, waterfront produces the best overall returns.  Precious metals are usually secure but you have to be careful, silver for example hasn't gone up nearly as fast as gold.  Divirsify your portfolio, the overall average won't be as high as you might have made but your investment will be far more secure.  High return usually = high risk and all too often big losses, if you have inside knowledge you can do well otherwise you will probably loose.  Compounding a low rate of return can yield huge returns over time and are usually a safe investment ie. term deposits.  Apart from that if a financial advisor was any good, they wouldn't have to ask you to invest, they would already be rich!  Oh, and by the way; His initial $500,000.00 investment is now worth about $350,000.00 after 10 years. My investment (after I cut my losses) is now worth about 4 times what it was when I started.  Do it yourself, read, learn, and avoid anything that promisses huge returnes!"

Stock market should do well over the long term but the financial world could come tumbling down some day.  Avoid mutual funds.  The annual 2-2.5% fee they charge usually results in lower returns than ETFs (a basket of stocks in various sectors of the market) which charge less than 1%  A lot of advisors recommend equities outside of RRSP.  Interest bearing within RRSP.  Start young.  Keep plugging away.  Pay for fishing gear with cash so the Misses can't track it

814724,woodenboater,2013-10-24 11:18:00,2277,"If I had to do it all over again, I'd sink a good chunk into property. Don't even want to think about what my bank account would be like if only I'd bought years ago. Agree with precious metals, gold will always be the go to in bad times. Platinum and palladium are other key metals.  Much will depend on how risk averse you are or aren't. I'm kinda risk averse now so would do the compounding low rate over long term idea Big Cliff suggests."
814737,crappieperchhunter,2013-10-24 13:14:00,2582,Financial advisers are just like any other professionals. There are good ones and there are not so good ones. I am lucky because my wife has been in the banking industry for over 25 years and knows many advisers on a personal level.  Our advisers would not even talk to us if we walked in off the street. These guys don't even handle portfolio's as small as ours   However because of there work relationship with my wife they have taken us under there wing and helped us out. There fee's have been a little high...however...  we are averaging over 8% through the last 4 years so I'm not complaining.  On a personal level I have found the best way to make money is through real estate...particularly rental income. If you have the ambition and the time I would highly recommend checking into that Mike.

817202,Old Ironmaker,2013-11-07 11:39:00,8243,"I strongly believe in real estate investment for the average working man or woman. It has served me well over the years. If you have the stomach, have better than average DIY skills and are a people person property management may be something for you. If somewhat confrontational and volatile it's not for you. Stick to the flips. Can't afford the downpayment, partner with someone you trust and has a set of skills you don't. Invest 70% on the next project and put 20% into the RRSP's and 10% into the stock markets  The market in Hamilton is hot. Some comparables are as low as 30% of the Toronto markets. The generation X and Y kids just can't afford to live where they work in TO. Retirees are selling modest homes in Toronto for 750 K and buying luxury condos or McMansions in Hamilton and area for less than 1/2 that. They are flooding into Hamilton. Go service is being expanded, the Arts and entertainment scene is growing exponentially, most of the environmentally insensitive steel mills and heavy industry is a small fraction of what it was just 10 years ago, there are more Hospitals per capita than anywhere in Canada I've read. The health industry is the highest employer in the city, health workers are going to Hamilton for employment from everywhere in the country. All important factors for growth. Look at trends in society and invest there. There is plenty of waterfront available in Hamilton, Stoney Creek, Grimsby all the way to Niagara for a fraction of cost comparable to the GTA and near north. Port Dalhousie may not be a commute to TO but is a retirees dream. Waterfront property only goes up, basically recession proof. Lake Erie shoreline is still a good investment. Many of my neighbours are former commuters of the 400 north, they sold vacation properties there and bought or built here for sometimes less than 1/2 of what the northern property sold for.  I nearly lost a good chunk of Dinaro on a stock investment the entire family was hot for a few years ago. I did my due diligence by flying out to Vancouver to visit this burgeoning companies headquarters. It was 2 days before I could get anyone on the phone, with little investigation the world headquarters was in a strip mall in the suburbs not the glass tower that was on the website. Some listened others lost many thousands. Anyone cam make a fancy website, think Breaex Gold (sic) another scam, a big one. If it is stocks you choose due diligence is a must other then the penny game. I'd choose the bookies over penny stocks I can't touch or see.  If you have a passion for something invest in it."
