817340,Steve,2013-11-08 00:13:00,2075,You don't realize how close you can get with a radio DJ until they are gone.  I hate cancer.  AMF Mike.  Stay off the pipe and don't forget to wipe.

Sent a text into their station (977977) to offer my condolences, cancer takes another"

817458,GBW,2013-11-08 19:32:00,8460,Iron Mike WILL be missed by many and I sure am one of those many.  I have been listening to 97.7 since the 90's until as of late (been out of range) and he was by far the best radio personality ANY station could wish for.  You will be missed Iron one...
817460,esoxansteel,2013-11-08 19:40:00,1307,"97.7 what a great station, Iron Mike when i was in range, you made me laugh hysterically many times, and always made those long drives seem shorter. RIP    The snapper snowblower 4-sale skit was the funniest, where an old lady was selling a snapper snowblower and Iron Mike phoned up and asked if he could come over a take a look at her, you guessed it sna--er, he proceeded to ask her how old it was, and been totally oblivious to the on call radio joke, the lady kept answering all Mikes questions which went on for probably 5 minutes,"
