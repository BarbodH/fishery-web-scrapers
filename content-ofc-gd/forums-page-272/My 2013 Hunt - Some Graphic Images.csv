(that will change)  But I did manage to get my moose hunt in with a group of guys I have known since kindergarten.  (and yes they did invite me lol)  The camp is well organized and there is rarely a year where they arent successful  Theres enough guys in on the TAG that usually and adult tag is available.  The camps been there in various forms since the late 40's I think, and I've been in and out of there with my bud for a long time.  All the Uncles and cousins nephews and family friends usually make it in, for the week long hunt.  My buddy runs things for the most part now (3rd generation) and set me up with a bunk and a watch tower for the week.  Cell service is just about non existent most of the time, so it was kinda nice to take a break and just ... well watch.   The food was amazing as always and the evening conversations.. always piled high .. lol  My buds two daughters are quite into the hunt and are responsible for skinning out and then on the last day everyone gets together and the moose is cut and packaged right at camp.  Heres a few pictures, enjoy.  The Watches                        "
