816492,mike rousseau,2013-11-03 02:46:00,4661,"Hello all...  I'm looking for a great pair of cold weather gloves... Waterproof is a must... And the need to be fairly warm...  Biggest factor is being able to perform regular fishing tasks... What I mean is hold a rod comfortably... All day... Be able to push buttons on my sonar... Use pliers to remove hooks from fish... Etc...  In all honesty  function is #1... If I can't fish with then they are of little use to me...  Waterproof #2... I would like to be able to handle fish with my gloves on when it's really cold...  Also handling rain when its barely above 0 degrees...  Warmth #3... Obviously they need to be warm... But not so big and bulky that I can't do anything... A nice balance...  AND NO MITT SUGGESTIONS PLEASE... I know the are warmer and so on... But my hands cramp up trying to hold my rod trolling and jigging  with mitts... I use mitts whenever possible but not for rod in hand fishing where ""feel"" is everything...  I did just get some under armour primer gloves... But they were a bit small... So the insulation was compressed and therefore didn't perform as well as they could.... They are 100% waterproof.... I mean I put my hand in the river to test them and they stayed bone dry waterproof... They look nice... Well built...  So as of now I'm leaning towards another pair of primer gloves (my brother is buying the pair I have at full price... He has little girly hands...) in an XL instead of the L I had...  I've heard ice armour glove are also good... But I was concerned with function... They look kinda bulky...  Anyways... I'd love to hear what you have to say...  Thanks..."

816515,Handlebarz,2013-11-03 10:55:00,3790,Glad you posted this mike as I was going to start the same thing as I need a new pair of gloves that are waterproof as the spray off the big musky size reels is alot and the cold days are here. I do like gloves with the rubber dots the last three pairs I used have them and its a must for me when casting big baits with colder hands I need the extra grip to not loose a rod
816587,Luke V.,2013-11-03 21:24:00,286,I use mechanics gloves with a pair of Laytex free rubber gloves underneath.  This is good until mid December After than I usle mitts I have not found a good pair of waterproof gloves I always wear the rubber gloves underneath. Best way to stay dry that I have found

816601,aplumma,2013-11-03 22:24:00,6896,Have you thought of using a muff warmer. I use it while waiting for a bite and hunting. You put your gloves of choice on and the muff is strapped to your waist. You put your hands in and when it is really cold a heat pack. I use it and if it gets fish on it I toss it into the washer no muss or fuss.  http://www.cabelas.com/catalog/browse/clothing-mens-hunting-clothing-mens-hunting-gloves-mens-handwarmer-muffs/_/N-1102426?WT.srch=1&WT.tsrc=PPC&WT.

816612,mike rousseau,2013-11-03 22:42:00,4661,"One hand on the tiller and one on the rod....  I considered a muff with hot paws... And just take 5 minutes every 30 minutes to warm my hands back up..,"
816649,aplumma,2013-11-04 01:01:00,6896,The issue with gloves is they can only be as thick as what you can tolerate between your fingers. My gloves of choice have the finger tips cut off the ends and then have a flap like a mitten over the tips. The flap folds back easily and the gloves are good enough for the short times they are exposed for knots and other delicate jobs. While they are not water proof I could see them fitting in a pair of the bulky gripper gloves that waterman use. If you can't find a pair of the gloves send me a P.M. I will shoot you a pair in the mail. A second thought for the tiller is a motorcycle hand boot it is like a muff but it stays on the tiller and you slide your hand in and out of it.   Art
816746,SylvanOwner,2013-11-04 18:29:00,266,"Some good ideas from Art there.  I have a pair of gloves with mitten flip-over that I use for ice fishing and that does work quite well.  Also have a pair of gloves/mittens that have a glove for the inner layer and then a waterproof mitten outer shell.  When I need to be dextrous I just pull off the mitten, do what I need and then slide it back over.  I'd have to check to see who makes 'em if you are interested.  Good luck in your search.  Dan"
816754,camillj,2013-11-04 19:28:00,1988,"Not sure why, but I find the gloves with the finger tips cut off seem to make my hands colder than no glove at all ... my choice is a pair  allweather golf gloves if I really need to keep them on all the time ... if not I prefer the great BIG Skidoo mitts .... I just toss em off when I need to use my fingers (or tuck em in my waders if Im in a stream)  Ice fishing I go bare most of the time ... and tuck em under my arms if they start to get numb"
816767,aplumma,2013-11-04 20:20:00,6896,If you get the wrong tipped gloves they can make your fingers colder. The tipped gloves that have to big of a seam at the top will slow the blood flow because they constrict when you have your fingers touching. The fleece or ragwool ones are the way to go.   Art

816773,manitoubass2,2013-11-04 20:45:00,11391,I just remembered that last year i tried something new that you might be interested in trying. Its a capsacain based cream used for exposed skin. It worked awesome. One trip i didnt even wear gloves for like 8 hours and my hands were still not frozen. Id have to search for it again though to show ya cause mines burried in storage. Someone recommended it to me said it was popular for mountain climbers
