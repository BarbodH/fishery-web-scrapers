816557,Steve,2013-11-03 16:24:00,2075,you did awesome in the skinny water! to put together a winning program while fishing the shallows isn't easy.  unless your constantly paying attention (which steve was) you'll get blown up into the shallows and potentially screw up an 8 rod spread.  my favourite two months on the lake for kings are April and August.  great job!
