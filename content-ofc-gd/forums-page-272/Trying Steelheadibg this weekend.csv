This time of year a 2 degree swing will usually turn the fish on.  If you've had a fresh dumping of snow that will have dropped the water temp several degrees. Usually the afternoon is best on days like this especially when it's sunny out.  Carry a thermometer with and check to see what the water temp is at different times. Jot that info down in a notebook for future reference, it can be very helpful.  Cheers"

817415,Old Ironmaker,2013-11-08 15:35:00,8243,"Good info guys for this Steelhead challenged individual, me. Tried last week on the Grand, suffice it to say it is still on my bucket list.  Every time I head out to get a species on my bucket list, Steelhead being one, I catch a cold, doe's that count against a skunk?  When I'm not targeting a fish, bam, I get my fish. First Musky trolling for Walleye, first Rainbow (can I count that as a Steelhead?) downrigging for Erie Walleye. First Shark jigging for Grouper. First Snook floating a shrimp for Sea Trout. First Sea Trout jigging for Snook!  So tell yourself you are going for something else and boom, you'll  have one on."

I got some fish this morning Mike. Not going to get into details. Lets say,listening to advise on how to fish high waters, paid off.  Thanks for the advise Mike. I know guys that have done great in the afternoon bite."

817217,mike rousseau,2013-11-07 13:24:00,4661,"Well I'm finally giving steelhead another go....  I've been 3-4 times ever and only landed one... And oddly enough that one was caught casting small cranks of all things...  This time I have a friend from work taking me and showing me the ropes... 90% of his fishing is for steelhead... So I feel that I'll be in good hands...  He's explained shooting patterns for different water condition... He's supplied me with chinook and brown eggs...  But with anything ""new"" I could use some more confidence....  So I'm looking for any general tips you'd have for a rookie...  I'll be fishing eastern tribs... So if anyone has any current advice based on conditions that would be appreciated as well... Roe bag size... Color... Jigs... Flies... Etc...By PM of course...  We are fishing Saturday.... Maybe I'll see some of you on the rivers as well...   BUT PLEASE... IF YOU HAVE ANY SPECIFIC ADVICE OR INFORMATION... GO TO A PM PLEASE...  Not a ""steelheader"" but I understand the pressure put on this fishery....   Thanks  Mike"

817221,Garnet,2013-11-07 14:00:00,2056,"As the saying goes ""You should have been there yesterday""  That float is adjustable for a good reason.  And if you fish the frog water minimize the junk down your line. Water will likely be clear."

817244,Richard S.,2013-11-07 16:41:00,75,"Get there before first light, it should be good for a few hours untill the masses move in and the sun hits the creek, after that call it a day and go home, the fish will be spooked from all the floats being ripped across the pools and the sun. On a positive note you should be home by around 9 or so.  Rich."

Drove through a virtual blizzard on the way home from Georgian Bay today, very unexpected.   Mike considering where you live you should be fishing the Salmon river in NY. It's 10,000X better than fishing the ditches and it's closer to you."
