817756,Beans,2013-11-10 17:18:00,3339,I'm not sure if this is true but I was told many moons ago that the Trent-Severn runs over limestone and that pike do not tolerate the ph level...Maybe with all the cottages and run-off (fertilizer etc.) the ph level of the lakes and rivers has changed ???  Bay of Quinte and Georgian Bay have always had pike at both ends of the Trent-Severn...that doesn't explain why they are in Lake Simcoe though...
817766,BillM,2013-11-10 18:22:00,17367,why do you mention it? did you hook into one?  My buddies have pulled probably a dozen of the things out of there this fall.

817913,Ron,2013-11-11 17:01:00,1683,"Actually,  Pike did not migrate from Seymore Lake (Campbellford) until after the Lift locks were installed. Before the locks, there was a natural barrier - Rainy Falls. On the other end, same thing, There was no real connection to Balsam Lake before the lift locks were installed from the Mitchel Lake side. Balsam Lake being the highest point of the TSW, originally water flow ended up in Bay of Quinte."
354118,Jer,2009-06-21 13:01:00,1426,"  The lakes are much more natural than you might think. For example, the dam in Buckhorn raised the Tri-Lakes water level by only  about six feet when it was built. This certainly made the lakes bigger and deeper, but they were certainly here before the system was built.  Naturally occurring 'gamefish' before the dams & locks were built and alternative species were introduced was limited to muskie & smallies. Walleye & largemouth were introduced and stocked by the MNR over the years (but not for a long time)."
354157,Cookslav,2009-06-21 15:50:00,1457," I don't know that anyone is demonizing them, but I Know I can catch Pike in just about any were in Ontario, were Muskie are A tad bit more evasive. The Kawartha's have a great Muskie fishery...thats unique in its own right, and it would be unfortunate to see That change.  I've seen this pike ""invasion"" first hand... A family member has a hunt camp on the Crow river were it comes into a big lake between a series of large rapids called Mud turtle Lake. Its pretty remote, and has no access unless you own property, or have a reeeeely strong drive to bush wack LOL! Anyway, It used to have a very Healthy Muskie Population, with some caught as big as 48"" in our group. Large mouth, perch and Pickeral were quite robust as well. Then some 20 years ago Pike were being caught.... No one has caught a Muskie in the last 10 years, Large mouth are still there, but Small mouth have boomed, and Pickerel, and Perch populations are way down. No suprise but Hammer handle Pike are EVERY WERE. Don't get me wrong there are some big Pike as well, but the Pike are flourishing, and unfortunatly they are taking over everything. I'm no biologist, so I can't say for sure but the numbers of Pike seem to have decimated the Perch, and Pickeral Populations as well. Why the Large mouth are disapearing is beyond me? I would have thought they would push the smallies out, but hey....nature is a funny little puzzle somtimes. We figure the Pike came in through a Creek that runs to a near by lake known to have Pike. It was an unlikely route to travel, but in the spring when the water is high its the most likely source. So Its a natural invasion....Its just unfortunate  I also know of a lake in Bruce county that used to be GOLD for Smallmouth. It was not uncommon to catch them by the dozens, with brutes into the 19-20"" range not uncommon This lake was Deep, round, with plenty of forage....it was like God planted this little Bass Garden that was like a fishing paradise. Then, A cottage went up....then a few more....then some body put Largemouth in there....now the lakes is in some sort of weird Transition? Smallies populations are down, Largies are rare but are being caught and last year I'm told a Pike was caught. I have little hope for the once prolific Smallmouth lake, and this was a man made invasion... Its just to bad, as there are TONS of good lakes to catch Pike with in a 10 minute drive....  A once great Muskie Fishery is gone, and a once great Smally fishery is gone...yet those Pike lakes in the Area are still going strong? I think thats why people get in a huff over it...no one is demonizing Pike, its just there are already many, many strong Pike fisheries around so its just sad to see our other opportunities limited.

I have been fishing Sturgeon, Pigeon and Buckhorn for 50 years and have never seen a pike. Last time we were fishing for muskie on Pigeon we were pulled over by the MNR / OPP boat and they asked us if we have ever caught any Pike so they must be coming down the Trent. The first time I ever saw a Crappy in the Kawarthas was in 1992 and now there are billions of them.The pictures above sure look like Tiger Musky. There is prominent Pike markings on the fins as well as the groovy tiger stripes. You can never be 100% without DNA testing because lots of times pike and muskie can have some freaking colour and skin patterns and look a lot like a tiger muskie but still be pure. Most official Tiger Muskie that I have seen have had a lot more brown in them. I donâ€™t know if that means anything. There is also a strain of Muskie called a Leopard Muskie, which often gets mistaken for a Tiger Muskie - http://www.musky.ca/leopardmuskie.htm"

Survey nettings by the MNR on Balsam have confirmed the increase as well, what is probably even more alarming is both the MNR, Muskies Canada, and the OFAH now have documented proof of Pike movements from the southern K Lakes namely Rice Lake and the Otonabee River below lock 19 as Ron stated, MCI always suspected this, but documented proof was lacking until this year, and it was discussed to some length at the last FMZ 17 meeting on October 1 2013.

353589,Tom McCutcheon,2009-06-19 18:00:00,627,This appears to be hot debate.  How many of you filled out the FMZ17 survey in March? How many of you attended one of the numerous public meetings with the MNR regarding proposed changes and management suggestions? The MNR is trying to get a handle on this before it gets out of hand. Lets let them and the biologists do their jobs with some guidance from anglers and cottagers. They do seem to be listening.  Cheers Tom.

They are currently on the Tri Lakes this year. They go in cycles. Please give them the time to let them do their job when approached.  I would love to start this thread and maybe get it pinned.  The meetings are not enough as most guys like to talk but dont bother doing anything about it. Most guys never even heard of the survey or meetings.  I would love to give the MNR a hand into doing stuff to better our lakes. If someone on here can get me into contact with someone who can arrange that I would be gratefull. Why dont we try and set something like that up. That I think would be a great idea for this entire site to maybe do something like that. Lets put our time into something we all enjoy.  2nd note: I just got off the phone with one of the Biologists at the Peterborough office. You have to  infact abide by ther catch limits for area 17 Kawarthas invasive or not species but was encouraged to harvest Pike.  You are not to harvest a Pike and let it go to waste, in doing so you are commiting an offense and can be charged.  just to clarify I had 2 other guys with me the day I caught the 9 fish."

353628,Jonny,2009-06-19 19:34:00,1380," Thanks for the clarification.  I was pretty sure that would be the case. It is illegal to let game fish spoil. As I understand it, if you catch it and kill it, you have to consume it. (Game fish only.)* That is one of the reasons, I believe, that carp is not classed as a game fish. You can kill carp (i.e. by bow-fishing) and you don't have to eat it. In places where you can bow-fish for pike, you have to eat the pike. That's my understanding anyway, never having bow-fished.  I would have been surprised to learn that the regulation for the killing of game fish would have been amended for one particular lake.  ---  * AFAIK, you are not even supposed to throw out game fish that has become freezer-burnt in your freezer."
353679,Jigger,2009-06-19 21:41:00,1237,"One of the methods of control discussed in the draft I posted mentions drawing the water down around the time Pike would normally spawn, leaving their spawning bays on the dry side, and then raising the water tables to allow for those areas to be available to musky in their time of need. Seems like the most efficient way to try and control the Pike population."
353706,Slayingm,2009-06-19 22:45:00,204,   Hi Jigger:  Thanks for posting the link to the MNR Doc.... upon futher investigation on my end it seems that pike have moved up the system and have been reported being caught in some other Kawatha lakes... I think this best think anyone can do right now is keep any Pike they caught (regulation limits apply)... they are a good eating fish.  Take care and Good Fishing... Greg.
353745,Bob,2009-06-20 00:13:00,370,"I can't understand everyone demonizing pike.  It's another fish to catch and it's native to Ontario.  It's amazing they didn't spread throughout the Kawarthas as soon as the canal system was finished.  What took them so long?  In light of the many other waterbodies where they co-exist quite happily, why would the Kawarthas be any different?  Their spawning seasons must overlap or there would never have been the first tiger musky so the idea of young pike eating up the young muskies seems a little off.  Almost all fish are cannibalistic so why wouldn't last year's musky gobble up the newly hatched ones?  Hmm, maybe that's why reproduction rates aren't huge.  As long as there's enough forage to keep them going, they should get along fine.  Enjoy the new fishery and eat them up.  They're good.  Seems to me that a two pound pike would make a lovely snack for a fifteen pound musky, maybe you'll find your muskies growing faster."
353749,Jonny,2009-06-20 00:29:00,1380," Good point about the spread. That kinda puzzled me too.  And pike isn't a ""garbage"" fish. Very few fish are. Good agressiveness, good fight, good eating, what's not to like?"
353754,Kerry,2009-06-20 00:45:00,383,I love pike fishing like the next guy but if I'm going to Balsam it's for musky not pike.I'll stay at home and fish Cooch or St John for pike.The Kawarthas have been managed for Musky.The more we can do to help the better.CNE is a good approach. Kerry
353757,glen,2009-06-20 01:03:00,2641,"Thanks for the report Greg. We dont need any pike in the Kawartha lakes.  All you have to do is look at lake Dalrymple to figure that one out.  Dalrymple used to be an excellent muskie lake now the small pike took over and there are very few muskie.  Pike are slow growing and very few get to 40"".  Lets nuke them before its to late."
353783,Northhunter,2009-06-20 02:12:00,214," They will directly compete with the musky, and change the natural dynamic of the lakes. These are populations of musky that haven't evolved and adapted alongside pike. My understanding is that where they do coexist in numbers, musky have their own ""niche"" in spawning time and location - they spawn deeper and later. Musky pops. that don't develop alongside pike breed more like pike but still like the slightly warmer temps (the two species are very similar, but still different - their breeding habits have the same relationship). No pike = no niche. When northerns do move in, they are breeding where the native musky are.. but earlier. It doesn't help that juvenile northerns grow faster than muskellunge. A northern will try to eat something 2/3's it's length. The ones that live also directly compete with this new species for prey...and  prey is also very different in the kawarthas than someplace like Nipissing. I could be wrong, but I don't think there are any cisco, whitefish, etc., present. That's a very different and very major food source that isn't there. Just for fun, compare pictures of musky caught from the kawarthas with those from someplace like Nipissing, or the French, or St. Lawrence. It's something people might not notice unless you directly compare them and bring attention to it, but there's a reason they look very different."
353792,Jonny,2009-06-20 02:36:00,1380,"Although pike is one of my favourite sport fish, it was not my intention to downplay the concern about pike being invasive in the Kawarthas.  The question of how they got there, and why it took so long, is a good one, although it doesn't alter the fact. Isn't the Trent-Severn Waterway well over 100 years old? Something must have changed, or it might even be that someone intentionally introduced them?  What's the best guess?"
353813,Bob,2009-06-20 07:39:00,370,"In many cases, fish that spawn in shallow water are easily spread by wading birds such as heron.  They wade through the spawning beds and some fertilized eggs stick to their feet.  They fly to the next lake and these eggs fall off so now you have a population of fish introduced.  Again, why did it take so long in the Kawarthas?  Maybe they were there long before anyone started to catch or notice them.  Nature is funny. If life can exist, it usually will.  When I first started fishing Elliot Lake, there were no pike.  There were  lake trout, whitefish, smallmouth bass, catfish and ling.  That was 30 years ago.  In the last few years,there are pike being caught and not such small ones either.  There are 2 or 3 being caught over 20 pounds every year for the last 10 or so years.  Leads me to believe they were there for quite a while before anyone caught one.  Doesn't seem to have hurt the populations of the other fish.  Folks are still catching nice lakers and bass.  Where's the harm?  Some guys just seem right fanatical about muskies and they're nothing but another member of the pike family that tends to grow a little larger.  So what?"
353814,Northhunter,2009-06-20 08:06:00,214,I'm not fanatical about muskies. But to my knowledge there aren't exactly loads of lakes in Ontario where they exist without pike. Why change that to none.
353815,Terry,2009-06-20 09:44:00,14456,"pike don't like rapids so before the canal was built they didn't run the rapids, so it kept them from moving  plus pike, while they do move to different locations around a lake they keep the route for most of their life they spawn in the same river each year and in many cases the same spot, they are not natural wanderers. So the move into the kawarthas has been slow"
353817,ricoboxing,2009-06-20 10:23:00,398,"i have a conservation license, if i keep a tiger muskie, dosen't that mean im breaking the law?"
353865,Billy Bob,2009-06-20 14:47:00,5865,"You want to keep the pike population down............have local pike tournaments where you want them controlled. This could be a win, win for the area as it will bring in money to the local economy and everyone is having fun fishing."
353876,Jonny,2009-06-20 15:28:00,1380," Not a bad idea. But I wonder... if the numbers of pike are already at a level where they are being caught regularly, and enough possibly for a successful tournament, maybe fishing for them to control them is like the proverbial boy with his finger stuck in the hole in the dam.  I'm also thinking that fishermen's reports to the MNR about how many pike are being caught, and where, might help make a nice study about the spread and increase in the pike population, but it probably won't do much to halt the process. You'd have to catch a LOT of pike to make a dent, and if you catch lots, then there are lots more out there. It sounds like it could be a losing battle if the pike have found a niche and are determined to occupy it."
353902,Garnet,2009-06-20 16:59:00,2056,I've caught pike in every area of Balsam lake and like eating pike. It's probably to late but I'm still  going to eat everyone.  Garnet
353966,Bob,2009-06-20 19:59:00,370,"Here's something else to consider: the Kawartha Lakes didn't even exist before the construction of the Trent-Severn waterway so how many muskies would have been around then?  It's the system of dams and locks that created the lakes, before that there were just rivers with some wide spots maybe.  Might have been a trout fishery at one time.  Could be worth looking into the history of the area."
353329,Slayingm,2009-06-18 21:57:00,204,"Although I have heard rumors in the past that some Northern Pike have invaded Balsam lake through the locks from Canal lake I found what happened a couple days ago disturbing. I had some customers out on a guided fishing trip on Balsam lake and although we had a awesome day catching lots of nice Walleye we boated a Pike and only 5 minutes later we caught a Tiger Musky!! I have been fishing this lake for over 25 years and have never caught either species there before.  I sent these pics with some other details to the MNR for file (which they appreciated) and they confirmed with me the practice that any angler catching a Pike in any of the Kawartha lakes should keep it and not release.... this is exactly what we did. I fear that in a few years Balsam (and possibly other kawartha lakes) could go the way Canal and Dalrymple lakes did. They both used to be awesome Muskie fisheries years ago, followed by a few years of nice Tiger Muskie and now the Musky are pretty much gone and replaced by alot of smaller Pike.    One thing for sure is that the colours and bar patterns on a Tiger Muskie are absolutely beautiful... here is a pic of the one we boated:   Here is a pic of the Pike we caught and kept minutes before catching the Tiger Muskie:   Remember that if you ever catch a Pike on any of the Kawartha lakes KEEP IT!... also a good idea to contact the MNR and give them specifics in terms on lake, location etc.   Take care and Good Fish'n....

353347,Jonny,2009-06-18 22:48:00,1380," As long as you get boneless fillets off your pike, you can use any recipe that you use for pickerel. My wife actually prefers pike to pickerel --- she says there's a tiny bit more flavour.  Simplest thing --- wash fillets well, sprinkle with lemon juice, dredge in flour and fry crispy brown in hot oil with a generous dab of margarine melted in. Awesome.  ---  Man, I have never seen a tiger muskie --- beautiful fish! Too bad they're sterile (unless you're worried about invasive concerns)."
353366,Garnet,2009-06-19 00:02:00,2056,Caught 4 pike this year on Balsam and 2 last year. Also sent pic to MNR. Afraid it's to late.  Garnet
353369,Tom McCutcheon,2009-06-19 00:05:00,627,"Northern Pike could potentialy destroy the Muskie fishery in the Kawarthas. It is a fact that Pike are invading the Kawarthas. Recently a chapter of Muskies Canada has been established in Peterborough. Our mandate is to try to educate the public about the Northern Pike invasion through our KTD (know the difference) signs, help to protect and re-establish Muskie spawning areas, promote catch and release and also help the MNR with catch and release data through our Angler Logs. This chapter hopes to make some progress in stopping this invasion.  We are a non profit organization and the monies raised from members and sponsor donations goes back in some way to the fishery.

353371,Fisherpete,2009-06-19 00:13:00,1814,"These two tigers were caught on Balsam last June two days apart. Bigger one was 37"". Never caught a pike out of Balsam yet, but have seen some on people's stringers. It would be really sad if Balsam turns into a Dalrymple type fishery. OFC'ers unite and CNE (catch and eat) all Pike from Balsam!!!!      On a positive note, we have caught a number of small muskies in the past few years as well, so at least there is still succesful spawning happening."
353376,mattyk,2009-06-19 00:27:00,2110,Here is a picture of a pike that I caught out of balsam two summers ago.  
353414,izaakwalton,2009-06-19 01:43:00,27,"A few questions about pike, tiger musky, and musky in the Kawarthas: 1.  If caught, do tiger musky have to be kept as well?  Although they are sterile, won't they be just as much a threat to musky hatchlings? 2.  Are tiger musky edible?  Do they taste similar to pike? 3.  If pike are such a prized fish for their taste, shouldn't musky be similarly tasty?  The argument for avoiding musky is that, as the top predator in the food chain, they contain the most mercury - but aren't pike the top predator in Simcoe, Dalrymple, Canal, etc.?  Looking forward to the responses.  Thanks in advance."
353428,John Bacon,2009-06-19 02:31:00,3277," 1. No, tiger muskies do not pose the same threat to young muskies as pike.  It is not the adult pike that are a problem, it is the newly hatched pike.  Pike spawn a few weeks earlier than muskie but spawn in the same locations.  When the muskies hatch the pike that hatched a few weeks earlier will feed on the newly hatched muskies.  Tiger muskies don't reproduce so they are not a problem.  Muskies that co-exist with pike, such as those in Georgian Bay, are a different strain and spawn in deeper water than the Kawartha lake muskies; and thus, avoid the pike. 2. Probably, but I believe that you have to follow the muskie size limits when keeping tiger muskies. 3. I am not sure what a muskie tastes like, but I don't think that I would want to eat one that has attained legal keeping size.  Most people who eat pike are probably not eating many four footers."
353438,Fisherpete,2009-06-19 02:47:00,1814,"The only muskie I have ever kept and eaten was a deeply hooked 36""/9 pounder that could not be revived despite trying for half an hour. It was actually pretty good, I would actually say maybe even better tasting than pike. Or maybe I was just really hungry that night LOL! That being said, I would not want to eat any Pike or Muskie that was 40""+, firstly because bigger fish of any species generally are not as good tasting as smaller ones, and secondly due to toxin build up in their tisssues from age. Keeping tigers really is not a bad thing, as they can't reproduce at all, but maybe you might want to let them go as they are so nice looking and someone else would love a chance to catch them!"
353442,jediangler,2009-06-19 02:56:00,1923,"I would release any Tigers you catch in the Kawarthas. Letting another fisherman enjoy the unique opportunity of catching a ""Natural Tiger"" would be reward enough for me. In the U.S. they stock lab created Tigers in resevoirs where panfish like bluegills have taken over. It gives the local sportfishing population an aggressive, fast growing predator to angle after. Once the lifecycle of the most recently stocked Tigers nears it's end, they can introduce largemouth and spotted bass to the lake. Gives the bass a fighting chance against large numbers of Bluegill. Since Balsam is the highest lake in the chain, water flows out in both directions. Has anyone caught any pike in Cameron lake or Sturgeon yet?"
353446,Rizzo,2009-06-19 03:01:00,4754,scary. I had heard rumours of pike in Balsam a few years ago but now we're seeing lots of proof. Think I'll go there Saturday and try to pull a few out!
353458,mbac31,2009-06-19 03:51:00,904,"I have personally caught almost 30 there so far this year. I caught this one recently. I keep them for my Dad, he loves them. I personally dont let any go. The Ministry have known about these for a while now and have done little about them. My biggest so far this year is 42 1/2"". I pretty much have mapped where the buggers are congregating right now.  3 weeks ago I got 9 pike in one day. All were terminated.  I dont have pics of all of them but here are some from Balsam so far this year.       Good luck keeping them out of there. Balsam is soon going the way of Dalrymple for certain."
353469,yo_guy,2009-06-19 05:14:00,111,Perhaps the limit for Pike should be set at unlimited?
353485,Baptiste,2009-06-19 10:27:00,37,"About 10 years ago people started to catch the occasional pike on Baptiste and Elephant Lakes which were previously pike free. The cottagers' assoc. are in the middle of a Walleye revival campaign and the the Musky, wally, LM and SM are still out there but it's not uncommon to catch pike all day where the others used to be. The hammer handles are becoming trophies."
353492,Jer,2009-06-19 11:27:00,1426,  What would you have them do?
353493,Musky or Specks,2009-06-19 11:31:00,2710,Hes right short of poisoning the entire fishery community of the lake and starting over nothing can be done about invasive species. Thats why it is such a problem.
353503,mbac31,2009-06-19 12:03:00,904," How about letting guys keep them all. That would be a start. I'm not talking about the guys on the beat. 'm talking about these guys who run it. To soon we will have the Pike in most lakes. Look at Algonquin, they are keeping them out of there for now. I have a cottage near Baptiste lake and Elephant. The lakes are full of Pike that only a few short years ago were sm all. I'm now catching 40 Plus inchers. We have a Government agency that we pay to do a job. How about getting to the point and voicing our oponions to them properly. We all pay for this resource. Why not get what we pay for. Limits, seasons, invasive species, etc. Canada is to dam slack in their it will be ok attitude. Give it a couple of years, they will be in Scugog and Rice. Then good luck with your ""What would you have them do attitude"". How about take some of the mon ey we spend in the industry and just do something. This is getting discusting. Problem is they dont have to manage the waters when there are pike in there. They are getting lazier."
353556,Jonny,2009-06-19 14:29:00,1380,"So am I understanding this correctly? The MNR is saying you should kill all the pike you catch but you can't keep over your limit? Does that mean a knife through the backbone and let them sink to the bottom if you're over your limit, or if you don't want to keep pike to eat?  Lake Nipissing now has a large number of smelts, where before I believe there were none. I'm not sure much can be done about that either. So we get out our smelt nets during the run and make the best of it. There are getting to be so many that I am sure they will change the balance of our lake."
