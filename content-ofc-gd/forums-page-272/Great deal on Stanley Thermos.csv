816874,Old Ironmaker,2013-11-05 13:19:00,8243,"Sorry to say Fisherman not much else is made there or here any longer. I sure got the shock of the year when I brought home my first time ever brand spanking new Chevy Silverado in 2011 with the 25 KMS I put on it during the test drive. My Uncle opened the door and said "" Lets see where she was made ""  MEXICO  I wanted to cry. México and not México Nevada. So my baby traveled over 3000KMS before I took it for a run. I made steel for the big 3 for 30 years and my first new vehicle was made in México.  So I don't think it's much of a big deal a cup is made in China or wherever.  México!"
816876,BillM,2013-11-05 13:43:00,17367,"They've been assembling cars in Mexico for 20+ years, people are surprised?"

816579,krixxer,2013-11-03 20:04:00,274,Hate to give them business but Wall mart has the Stanley Classic 1L thermos for $23 on special  ...Bass proripoff has them for over $40 .........and I've seen them as high as $50    
816580,DRIFTER_016,2013-11-03 20:10:00,10439,I'll have to check my local Wally World.
816581,Fisherman,2013-11-03 20:13:00,7201,"Turn it over and see where it's made, then call back in 23 years and see if it still keeps the food or drink hot.  They are not made in the US for about the past 5+ years."
816582,krixxer,2013-11-03 20:34:00,274,I've been testing the Chinese one I just bought for 2 days now.  After 8 hours in the freezer water came out at 77C
816613,Cosmos,2013-11-03 22:46:00,588,I bought same one last year. I was really pleased with it whole ice fishing season.
816640,crappieperchhunter,2013-11-04 00:30:00,2582,I love taking soup or stew out on the ice in a thermos. I have a big polar fleece sweater I wrap the thermos in to help keep it  hot longer. If it is a real cold day I can put my sweater on as another layer later in the day...and the sweater is warmed up nicely from the thermos when I put it on  Crappy Tire may play games with their pricing but if you flyer watch and are patient you can always  get great deals on stuff.  Thx for posting. I'm sure someone on here will grab one of those thermos and enjoy it.
816660,1Kawartha1,2013-11-04 01:36:00,12,"Can't go wrong for $23. Just be sure to pre-heat it with boiling water for a few minutes, dump it out and then fill it. Mine will keep coffee piping hot for about 48hrs while out on the ice for a weekend."
816662,Joeytier,2013-11-04 02:47:00,3990,Yeah these thermos' are excellent.  Had a thermos of chicken broth in my truck for 2.5 days with temps between 0 and -5 and it was still hot to the tongue.
816664,danc,2013-11-04 02:55:00,4677,I've been testing the Chinese one I just bought for 2 days now.  After 8 hours in the freezer water came out at 77C Just bought a new thermos brand a week ago and did the freezer test. Boiled water to start with and after 28 hours I couldn't hold my hand under the water when pouring it out.
816665,BillM,2013-11-04 02:55:00,17367,"Sounds like I should pick up a couple of these, thanks for the heads up!"
816686,davey buoy,2013-11-04 09:18:00,5505,"I have had mine for over 10 years,still keeps things hot.Used 5 days a week for coffee. Other than a couple dings and a good bleaching once a month,works almost as good as new!!!"
816689,Rich,2013-11-04 11:04:00,3927,"I got one last year, love it! A MUST for any winter fishing!"
816731,Cosmos,2013-11-04 16:03:00,588,Came back from local CT. They do have some thermoses on sale as well. One for $31(originally $41) looks really nice. 24 hours guaranteed.  And of course it is made in China as well.
816732,JoshS,2013-11-04 16:32:00,729,"I had no idea a thermos could last that long! I've been using cheap crap for the last few years. I'm gonna grab one, thanks for the tip."
816742,Headhunter,2013-11-04 17:50:00,5703,"I've had my stainless thermos for the better part of 20 years. Works perfectly as long as you pre-heat it with boiling water before you add your beverage of choice. I remember the first time I used it, we were fishing Quinte in a tinny. Spray was flying everywhere and with temps in the minus 10 area, I found my brand new thermos frozen solid under an inch of ice, to the bottom of the boat. Had to literally kick it free in order to enjoy my still very much steaming beverage. A must have as far as I'm concerned. HH"
816761,kickingfrog,2013-11-04 19:50:00,8333,Picked one up today. My son is a bit young for coffee but hot apple juice warms him up good.
816762,Sinker,2013-11-04 20:03:00,8692,"Great thermos. No problem keeping things piping hot all day. I ran over my last one with a truck, and it still worked fine lol.  S."

816788,Roy,2013-11-04 21:38:00,13728,Ya but how was the thermos?  HA!
816809,BillM,2013-11-04 22:51:00,17367,"Lucky me, got the last one on the shelf at the Mapleview store.  w00t!"
816817,Whopper,2013-11-04 23:22:00,2174,"I have two, the eldest is now 36 years old this month and still works well and I never go fishing without it. The first 15 years of service it was used everyday while I worked outside doing construction work, it has been beat to death and I can't tell you how many replacement stoppers and cups I've went through. Like someone else said the trick, is pre heating the thermos with very hot or boiling water. I have newer one that is about ten years old that I haven't used but about six times and looks brand new, got it for Christmas because the giver didn't  like the way old trusty looks. I am a heavy coffee drinker and my first has worked well for me."
816823,aplumma,2013-11-05 00:00:00,6896,This is the first time I have ever heard of a run on thermoses.lol    Art
816825,krixxer,2013-11-05 00:02:00,274,"I know my fishing reports don't impress anyone so I glad you guys liked the tip  ok now that we all have a nice thermos for our coffee let's talk beans!  Last year my family switched over to http://www.baroccocoffee.com/ , a local place I have near my shop. They import, blend and roast onsite.  I like the Appian bend, rich and creamy and not burned black  .......please tell me you guys don't think Timmy's or County style make make a respectable cup of coffee? Sure we all drink, it but is real coffee?......"
816832,kickingfrog,2013-11-05 01:05:00,8333,This is the first time I have ever heard of a run on thermoses.lol    Art  It is November in Canada after all.
816869,aplumma,2013-11-05 12:20:00,6896,Yea we have the same here with snow shovels except we wait till it is snowing and then take our poor snow driving skills and run out to Home Depot. I am thinking we would be better off if we planned ahead and bought thermoses instead  and stayed at home with a nice hot cup of coffee.    Art
