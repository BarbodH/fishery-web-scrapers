Well, we're at Hay Bay - may as well do some fishing.  Loaded John's boat and launched and began to fish at 0945, we were fishing the middle of Hay Bay with a water temp of 46-47 degs F.  Marked some fish in deep pockets, but after changing the lures very often, we couldn't find the right combination to attract any fish.  We thought of heading to Long Reach, but the winds had picked up and it would take a LONG run there, so we continued to fish the area in the lee of the winds.  Back and forth in our trolling lanes we went with no luck at all.  We packed it in at 1545 after 6 hours of trolling. We got the big SKUNK!!!!! You can't win all the time.  Fishing has a funny way of bringing you back to reality, just when you feel you know the answer, they change the question.  Looking forward to 15th and 16th for some more fishing.   Stay Tuned David  aka  Superdad "

817552,Old Ironmaker,2013-11-09 03:35:00,8243,So in reality that was a fishing un-report. A very good skunk report. Not something you see here everyday. I can now report with regularity on my Steelhead hunt.  Here's a photo of my last outing.
