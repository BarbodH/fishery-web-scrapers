Would like  to know if I would have to buy a quick disconnect bracket?.Thanks for any help. Will send a second picture showing the bottom."
817791,davey buoy,2013-11-10 22:45:00,5505,Here's the second picture.Thanks. 
817794,bigbuck,2013-11-10 23:05:00,2449,Yes you do. It can be mounted but only permanently. The quick release bracket will make your life much easier. Make sure when you mount it that the trolling motor can deploy fully. It will probably stick out a bit.

817810,davey buoy,2013-11-11 00:12:00,5505,"How is the motor going to clear the bow rail on your boat? There's only one cleat in the way,and the front lightI .Hope with the quick release plate,and looking at it sitting on the floor,will clear the rail.If not I could take out one piece of rail.The rail is quite short.I will alter the light if need be."

817813,davey buoy,2013-11-11 00:22:00,5505,  Bought it used. Will have to drop by BPS tomorrow and see what is available. Looked at the CT website as well today.It said it comes with a quick release feature. Pretty awkward on your own to see how it goes without someone holding it.I'll have to see it demonstrated in store to see what's what.Thanks.

I only looked at 1 of many, many listings with info from Google referring to your Minncotta. I would rather go to BPS myself but you can save a lot more time for fishing later looking online now. You sure do ask a lot of questions that you can answer yourself with a little effort on your part. Same goes for looking for a trolling motor. Advice is one thing, researching for someone is another.  Good luck with your new unit.  JD"

817943,BillM,2013-11-11 21:45:00,17367,"The MKA-21 is a flush mount, I wouldn't be putting that on carpet or anything that could possibly hold water.  I run the other mount I posted on our Terrova,  we raised it up just a wee bit with some plastic spacers so the carpet could dry out when it got wet.   If you're not mounting it to carpet, then you've got nothing to worry about (although I would seal it completely)"
