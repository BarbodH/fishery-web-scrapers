817975,Handlebarz,2013-11-12 00:17:00,3790,That's funny Brian as my lab does the same thing we can leave a steak on the table all day when at work it will still be there not touched. But we have to put the used dryer sheets in the locking lid garbage can as he goes through all the lint in the laundry room garbage to find sheets to rub his head on.  Sorry off topic  I just use dryer sheets it has been working for me.
818004,Entropy,2013-11-12 01:58:00,747,"I have heard Irish Spring soap, but if it were my boat I'd be using tried and true moth balls. Not a good idea, I have lost a few bars of Irish Spring bar soap to mice.  They eat through the box and then eat the soap!"
818006,Entropy,2013-11-12 02:01:00,747,"no, I think it was ivory soap."
818017,irishfield,2013-11-12 02:48:00,26272,Yah but then they fart soap bubbles and make your boat smell sparkly clean !
818018,limeyangler,2013-11-12 03:07:00,5204,here's what i use   meet Bert and NooNoo  Also more affectionate and fun than bounce sheets.                         
817796,chris.brock,2013-11-10 23:22:00,4053," I remember reading a previous post about this, I remember thinking ""wow, some great tips"", I can't remember what the tips were and can't find the old post  anyways, storing a sled for the summer or a boat for the winter, what are some good things to stash in there to keep deer mice and other stuff out? moth balls?  thanks, Chris"

Nothing that I can tell has attempted to get in my boat. I'm in a squirrel infested area as well.lol."
817798,irishfield,2013-11-10 23:26:00,26272,I've never had luck in cars with Moth Balls (mouse crap right in the pan holding them)... the only thing that I've seen any luck with are real brand name Bounce drier sheets.
817800,lew,2013-11-10 23:39:00,12766,"I stored my boat in a barn for 10 years and always put a couple bowls of mothballs in it and never once saw any evidence of mice, and we all know how mice like barns."
817802,i2cool2fool,2013-11-10 23:41:00,349,I use small trays with ample amounts of cloves. Works great inside my camper and boat.
817803,Garnet,2013-11-10 23:42:00,2056,"Go to TSC and get mouse seed. I leave a box in my boat every year, one quick look let's me know if I might have a problem."
817805,cram,2013-11-10 23:48:00,1733,"I have heard Irish Spring soap, but if it were my boat I'd be using tried and true moth balls."
817806,Bill Shearer,2013-11-10 23:49:00,456,"I second both the mothballs and the mouse bait. Either bars or seeds. Never an issue in a barn stored boat, over many years."
817807,Old Ironmaker,2013-11-10 23:57:00,8243,"A pal uses Irish Spring soap, I use moth balls. The cat sleeps in the boat under the shrink wrap. This her it not going to be here so moth balls and Irish Spring. I'm going to get a box of dryer sheets and put the moth balls and soap on them. With the cost of electrical and leather repairs one can't be too careful."
817830,bow slayer,2013-11-11 01:50:00,1074,"I have been using a combo of bounce sheets and irish spring soap  for 25 years now and have never had a problem with mice in my boats,tent trailer or my summer cruising car."
817833,Rob,2013-11-11 01:51:00,467,Charcoal in a 10# bag open it up and leave it in the boat. They don't like  the smell of fire i guess.  Rob C
817837,danc,2013-11-11 01:56:00,4677,Just move to Thunder Bay. I've never heard of anyone having critter in their boat problems here. Too cold perhaps?
817841,nancur373,2013-11-11 02:01:00,1211,"use irish spring soap shaved and put on little paper plates in my trailer every year. never a problem. I put them in every cupboard, closet and in different spots on the floor"
817845,chris.brock,2013-11-11 02:08:00,4053,"exactly, for the piece of mind, I am going to put a little bit of everything recommended in there, hopefully there isn't a chemical reaction and explosion (Hahaha)"
817846,BillM,2013-11-11 02:09:00,17367,Bounce dryer sheets.
817867,mike rousseau,2013-11-11 07:06:00,4661,Bounce sheets
817868,fishindevil,2013-11-11 08:45:00,6254,Raccoons and squerils hate cayanen pepper !!!! And nice hate steel wool and mothballs of course!!
817881,aplumma,2013-11-11 13:11:00,6896,I use rodent plug in squeakers they seem to work for me.    Art
817883,outllaw,2013-11-11 13:51:00,1232,funny. no one mentions. clean your boat out. all the munchies that are somehow still on board attract critters.. those old gummy worms potato chips and such are just a buffet in the winter.
817894,fishnsled,2013-11-11 14:52:00,3520,I always give the boat a good vacuum and clean out before putting it away.  I've never added anything to the boat to keep the critters out until I saw that thread you were talking about Chris.  Never had a problem with critters other then a couple of the neighbourhood cats that probably kept the mice away.    I now put the Bounce sheets throughout the boat and don't even get the cats anymore.
817902,Fisherman,2013-11-11 15:28:00,7201,"I've used Bounce sheets, the mice thanked me for providing a nice nest for them, I used mothballs, they played soccer with them. Fox pee is a natural repellant, it's an enemy to them and they don't hang around."
817918,Old Ironmaker,2013-11-11 17:29:00,8243,Covering it nice and tight works too. Even shrink wrapped there is plenty of venting with the plug out or cutting a window in it and screened over. I've seen what damage can be done to the wiring on a 2 year old Harley.
817949,mukluk,2013-11-11 22:22:00,196,I have had luck with mink oil. (The type you would put on your boots to waterproof them.) Simply wipe some oil unto several small pieces of wood and distribute throughout the boat.
817952,misfish,2013-11-11 22:38:00,29133,"Bounce sheets.LMAO  Everytime the mrs,s takes a load out of the dryer,Gizmo comes to life and ruffs,and snorts through the laundry til he finds it. Crazy bugger.  "
817953,JoshS,2013-11-11 22:41:00,729,"I used moth balls last year and found about 10 mice droppings when I uncovered my boat in spring. Looks like they went in and left.  The replies on this topic vary a lot.. mice are pretty adaptable, not sure of any sure bet method that would keep them away if they're abundant. Control the population, clean your boat well before storage and try to make it as uncomfortable for them as possible with some deterring scent"
