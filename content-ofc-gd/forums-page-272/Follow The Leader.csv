After about 10 minutes along comes another vehicle, the driver sees you fishing . . . .   he figures YOU must 'know something,' walks over and tosses in 10' away! After a little while along comes another car . . .   the 3 guys in it see there is 2 people  (who must 'know something') already fishing, they pull over and commence fishing. Next is a couple more, who, when they see a half dozen guys already fishin' they call their pals on their cell phones. By the time an hour has passed there are several people crossing each other's lines, a couple cars blocked in . . . .   so you give up and leave . . . .    ? Yesterday at Port Hope, somebody caught ONE SMALL fish out off the pier . . . .    within a couple hours there was a count of 19 people on the pier, 7 along the sailboat channel . . . .    NOBODY else got even a hit! Aren't these cell phones wonderful?"

817120,misfish,2013-11-06 19:00:00,29133,"Steve,did ya get up to my area for some perch? Lot to be had this year.   Once the hard water gets here,it will be the same. I caught one,get over here.LOL"
817132,DRIFTER_016,2013-11-06 20:06:00,10439,That's why we used to keep it on the DL. I remember one fall before the section below HWY 2 closed on Wilmot my 2 buddies and I were just crushing fish @ the first bend below the bridge. A couple of guys came walking down and asked us if we were having any luck. we said nope it's pretty slow. At the time my buddy and I both had fish on but we let off all tension so the rods were not bent and it looked like we were just bottom bouncing. As soon as they walked around the corner and out of site we resumed the fight!! You need to be able to disguise things if it comes to that. If we hadn't thought quickly and gone into stealth mode there would have been 2 more people trying to crowd us out of a really small piece of water. We poked 15 or 20 trout out of that hole in just a couple of hours.

817168,Ron,2013-11-06 22:36:00,1683,WHY CAN'T YOU JUST SAY AN EASTERN TRIB?  Blatantly naming the river does not help matters.
817170,DRIFTER_016,2013-11-06 22:42:00,10439,Pretty sure things have changed since the 80's. Could be wrong but I doubt it.
817171,fishindevil,2013-11-06 22:46:00,6254,Well let me tell you it's not just the tribs !!!! It happens on the kawarthas and all over the lakes even the Ottawa river specially if you get the net out guys watch through binoculars and I have caught several walleyes and within a few mins boats are right beside me !!!!! Same with bass fishing on some lakes the locals will pull right up and fish beside you !!!! And yes instant messaging just makes it even worse now too !!!!!
817467,Terry,2013-11-08 20:02:00,14456,"saying no one caught fish there, doesn't make me want to check out the river"
817475,porkpie,2013-11-08 20:54:00,2521,"Makes no difference, everyone knows where the ganny is, and he is basically saying he caught nothing.  I could see your point if he said he pounded em, and the fish where in thick.  Angler numbers actually appear down at port hope these days.  In the heyday, it was often shoulder to shoulder even midweek."

817492,SirCranksalot,2013-11-08 22:01:00,3291,"5-6 of us were fishing off Oro last winter but not catching anything. There were a few unoccupied holes quite close to us. 2-3 more guys came trudging out, ask us how we were doing, we told them, they proceeded to fish the holes right near us!! More amusing than irritating!"
817498,porkpie,2013-11-08 22:11:00,2521,"Me neither, I can actually get a spot to fish when I have occasion to be out that way!"
817503,Photoz,2013-11-08 22:37:00,792,"I've been fishing Port Hopeless about a dozen times since the salmon run ended . . . . ONE stinkin' 4 pound trout, with an 'ap' . . . a lamprey. Anglers way y y y down . . . . fish down even further!"
