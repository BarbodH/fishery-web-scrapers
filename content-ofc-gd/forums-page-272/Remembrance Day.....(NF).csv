817784,Terry,2013-11-10 21:39:00,14456,Let's all take a moment to remember     
817785,irishfield,2013-11-10 22:02:00,26272,"Indeed Terry.. so easy in the current ""me world"" to forget how we got here and continue to go about our daily lives, for the most part, unquestioned.  My brother in the mid 90's. Thought I had the group picture of my father in boot camp, 1944, but I think I gave it to my brother to add to his military collection."
817788,Terry,2013-11-10 22:25:00,14456,I think this songÂ  reminds us too   
817789,lew,2013-11-10 22:40:00,12766,"My Dad served 5 years in the Navy during WW2 and spent alot of time escorting convoys across the Atlantic, doing their darndest to keep the German U-boats from blowing up the Merchant Marine ships. Sometimes they were successful, sometimes they weren't. Three ships blew up close to my Dad's one night killing everyone.  That's Dad on your right, covered in coal dust, after coming off watch in the engine room.  His friend beside him was killed not long after this picture was taken.    Dad's ship, HMCS Kitchener, taking a pounding somewhere on the stormy Atlantic    This is my Moms brother who was a bomber pilot over Europe and was killed in 1942 along with his entire crew when their plane went down.  This picture was taken around 1939 when he delivered airmail to the small towns around Southern Ontario.    My grandfather, Dad's dad, spent the 1st world war fighting in the trenches of France with the British Army. He was injured by shrapnel but survived the horrors of trench warfare went on to live a very long and happy life.  Most of my uncles also served including one who spent 3 years in a Japanese prison camp in Burma where he was starved and tortured every day he was captive.  I'll be going to the Memorial Service tomorrow as I do every year and as always, I have much to be proud of.  Dad home on one of very few leaves.  "
817815,Old Ironmaker,2013-11-11 00:45:00,8243,"Lew,  It must be great to have those pictures, they are a treasure. Man your fathers shoes look like glass in a black and white photo, imagine what they looked like in real life.  If you see a vet tomorrow and we are blessed to have a few still with us from WW 2 make their day. Take the time to walk up to him and thank him/her for their service. It is much appreciated and tomorrow is a day where some bad memories are dug up and it is guaranteed to brighten them up a bit. Even if they didn't see action in this century or last odds are someone they knew that did and never returned."
817831,fishnsled,2013-11-11 01:50:00,3520,"Great videos Terry, watched them both earlier today.  Thanks for sharing your stories Wayne and Lew, great pics!  I'll be stopping tomorrow to remember all those who sacrificed so much for us.  Thank you."
817856,crappieperchhunter,2013-11-11 03:27:00,2582,"Thanx for starting this thread Terry....I look for it every year and ""A pittance of time"" has always been my favorite reminder of how thankful  we should all be for what those before us sacrificed for all of us. As I am inclined to do I mention my great Uncle every year at this time. His name is Leonard Birchall and was called the saviour of Ceylon by Churchill himself. Anyone who is interested please take the time and google his name. His career and accomplishment are well worth the read. Although I have never met the man and I never will as he has passed....my mom's chatter and pride at this time of year is infectious.  As Old Ironmaker has eluded above....if the opportunity arises for you to look a vet eye to eye and say thank you please take that opportunity.  God bless them all."
817865,fishindevil,2013-11-11 06:57:00,6254,They are all heros in my book for sure !!!! Many never came back and payed the ultimate sacrifice for the freedom in which we enjoy today !!!!! We remember !!!!!!

817880,aplumma,2013-11-11 13:09:00,6896,Thank you to all of my fellow Vets and the people who value the freedom they have won and protected your rights.   Art
817884,mercman,2013-11-11 13:55:00,7054,"In Flanders fields the poppies blow Between the crosses, row on row, That mark our place; and in the sky The larks, still bravely singing, fly Scarce heard amid the guns below.  We are the Dead. Short days ago We lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow, Loved and were loved, and now we lie In Flanders fields.  Take up our quarrel with the foe: To you from failing hands we throw The torch; be yours to hold it high. If ye break faith with us who die We shall not sleep, though poppies grow In Flanders fields."
817889,mattybculp,2013-11-11 14:31:00,388,"It is a day that I am truly proud to call myself Canadian, and how lucky I am to live in such a great nation. To my family, and all members of the armed forces for your service and ultimate sacrifice. THANK YOU ! Lest We Forget. Please take a moment at 11 am, to pay your respects!"

817917,Old Ironmaker,2013-11-11 17:22:00,8243,We don't need to wait until November 11th at 11 AM every year to take the time to think of our vets.
817919,lew,2013-11-11 17:32:00,12766,"I just got home from the service in Lakefield, and even though the weather was miserable, the turnout was more than impressive. Nice to see so many school children there too."
817934,kickingfrog,2013-11-11 20:59:00,8333,"In 1917 at battle of Vimy Ridge Canadian soldiers in the tunnels and caves near the battle field carved small mementoes into the soft chalk that lined the walls. They scratched thier names, hometowns and loved ones.  The country of Canada was 50 years old and it would be 48 more years until our flag had our maple leaf, but their hats and shoulder patches had a maple leaf.  Most of these tunnels were not explored or found for 90 years.    http://jam.canoe.ca/Television/2007/03/25/pf-3828721.html  http://www.warmuseum.ca/cwm/exhibitions/vimy/index_e.shtml"

817967,wormdunker,2013-11-11 23:28:00,1711,All of the above comments are really appreciated.  I never forget the vets.  I was not feeling well today so did not venture out of the house.  I did however tune into the Hamilton news channel for over 2 hours to watch the ceremonies at the Hamilton warplane heritage museum.  Wonderful to see 2200 people in attendance.
817977,Richie Razor,2013-11-12 00:25:00,536,War is Hell and Freedom isn't Free. Thanks to the vets that gave us the ultimate sacrifice so that we may live as we do.
