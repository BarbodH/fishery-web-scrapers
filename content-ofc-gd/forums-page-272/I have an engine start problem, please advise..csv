I haven't had any start up problems all year that is until the last run 2 weeks ago. She usually fires up on a second or maybe third crank. However 2 weeks ago it took at least 6 tries before she fired.  Yesterday nothing. Plenty of fuel. Put the spark tester on her and have nothing. ( cheap tester is suspect). The only thing out of the ordinary was that we found 1 bolt of 2 missing from the top of the powerpac. I thought it may have worked it's way out somehow, unlikely, but the bolt isn't at the bottom of the engine. Featherstone Ted looked in his Merc manual last night and we are going to work from the fuse panel back this afternoon after I pick up a proper spark tester. The 7.99 indicated from CTC is suspect, put it on the truck and sometimes it shows spark, sometimes not.  Any suggestions? Hopefully by the time I check here she's done.  Any help is greatly appreciated.  Johnny D"
817106,DRIFTER_016,2013-11-06 17:25:00,10439,I usually check spark using one of the spark plugs. Pull plugs out and plug one into a plug wire and ground out against the engine. Watch for the spark to jump across the plugs gap.  First thing to do if you find that there is indeed no spark is to test the CDI unit and the Stator assembly. I have info at home on my 1991 Merc that should cover this in the Merc repair manual I have. I can send you the pertinent info if you like. If so PM me your email address and I'll try to do it after lunch today.
817119,John Bacon,2013-11-06 18:59:00,3277,Start with the simple.  Clean the battery terminals and make sure you have a good connection there.
817308,HTHM,2013-11-07 21:19:00,4082,Kill switch??
817339,Old Ironmaker,2013-11-08 00:13:00,8243,"Yes Albert kill switch. You're good. How did you know? Wait, because I said so on Channel 6-8. You almost had me."
817342,HTHM,2013-11-08 00:18:00,4082,I couldn't resist....
817409,Old Ironmaker,2013-11-08 15:02:00,8243,"Thank you Drifter and JohnBacon for your replies. Yes it was something simple JB. Like putting the kill switch in the off position when I was cleaning the interior Sunday. Like I said to Drifter I don't know whether to laugh or cry, I choose to laugh because I don't need to BOAT right now/ bring out another thousand!"
817465,Big Cliff,2013-11-08 19:58:00,6899,"Simple but often over looked. I remember trying to start my sled one time, I had taken my helmet off and set it down (on the kill switch). I cranked and cranked and was ready to start taking things apart (with a hammer) picked up my helmet to walk back into the house and realized that the kill switch was right under the helmet. Started first pull after that. Don't feel bad, anyone that claims it never happened to them is probably  not being too honest!"
