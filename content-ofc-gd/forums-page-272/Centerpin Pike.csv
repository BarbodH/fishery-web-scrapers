816593,Rich,2013-11-03 21:55:00,3927,"Bored of the usual routine and faced with a beautiful fall day by myself, I figured why not deadbait with something more spicy than the usual baitcast outfit?  The fish were on fire, for here. I landed 2 little guys and one that measured 37"", not bad, not bad at all. By the way - 'big' pike on centerpin - best fight ever!!  I just ran a hook, sinker, and a 12"" lead of 40lb big game mono. For bait, 3 big dead salted emerald shiners.        "
816598,aplumma,2013-11-03 22:17:00,6896,looks like a good use for the centerpin congratulations   Art
816599,Rod Caster,2013-11-03 22:23:00,5784,"looks like fun, nice catch.  It's really funny that you did the 'steelhead/pin' photo. Now I want to see you do that with a wgsf, fallfish or perch haha."
816603,Joeytier,2013-11-03 22:25:00,3990,Yep that looks fun.  Cool report.  Makes me think i should get out for gators one more time.
816797,Rich,2013-11-04 22:16:00,3927,"Thanks guys, seems it was a one time affair. Did my best today but a couple 1lb largemouth and some perch were all that graced my presence. I want a 40""+ on that pin before winter. Lol"
816799,Roy,2013-11-04 22:23:00,13728,"Good stuff, Rich. Maybe try the TO harbour?"
816802,Rich,2013-11-04 22:29:00,3927,"Thanks Roy, I'd love to do that one day but it's a long trip and right now not a worthwhile one. I've seen (and lost while perch fishing) some giants in some local LPB canals in recent weeks. I'll be visiting them this week with a heavier leader.. hope they're still there.  If they're not.. drastic trips like T.O. harbour may be necessary. Haha"
816804,Roy,2013-11-04 22:32:00,13728,"If you want some really good pike leaders, talk to Fidel, AKA Highdrifter. They're the best I've seen."
816811,lurechucker,2013-11-04 23:02:00,28,must have been a good fight on the pin  cheers
816980,wildeye rainbow,2013-11-05 22:01:00,123,Nice gators!
817073,bman32,2013-11-06 14:05:00,27,"Right on man, I was contemplating using my pin too for shore fishing"
817129,Richie Razor,2013-11-06 19:50:00,536,Beauty pike!
817195,Christopheraaron,2013-11-07 04:47:00,3525,"Nice fish there! Now go do carp on the pin, that will give you a workout!"
817211,Rich,2013-11-07 12:56:00,3927,"Been there, done that! Loved it!  "
