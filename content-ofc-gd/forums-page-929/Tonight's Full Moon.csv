278931,BassAsin,2008-12-13 02:43:00,806,some good ole ccr jon fogerty is a legend!
278937,BITEME,2008-12-13 03:21:00,1969,  THANKS DOUG!!!!!!! going out back to watch now
278942,Leecher,2008-12-13 03:30:00,7832," Just the beginning Glen and I don't like it one bit     but nothing I can do about it and compared to last year.... we're short about 60cm's  Hopefully mother nature will somehow spare us from the nasty white stuff that's going to fall down.  Not good for fishing hard water..... makes for weak ice.... too many layers but hey, last year the ice got almost to 3' feet in thinkness, just looks like we're going that way this year so far Jacques"
278725,Greencoachdog,2008-12-12 18:47:00,8163,"The Moon will be at it's closest to earth tonight for the year, and should make for some good viewing and photo opportunities!  http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/28182139/?GT1=43001"
278728,JohnF,2008-12-12 18:49:00,3494, Is this the night you turn all hairy and howl at the moon?  JF
278730,Greencoachdog,2008-12-12 18:51:00,8163, I hope not!   ... but it's happened before.
278731,BITEME,2008-12-12 18:51:00,1969,Should make for some good deer slamming
278748,HTHM,2008-12-12 19:42:00,4082,"When I saw the title, and then the author, I thought this can't be good......Thankfully you kept ur pants on. This was intersting though : ""Try this trick, though: Using a pencil eraser or similar object held at arm's length, gauge the size of the moon when it's near the horizon and again later when it's higher up and seems smaller. You'll see that when compared to a fixed object, the moon will be the same size in both cases."""
278755,Clampet,2008-12-12 20:14:00,1947,Now it decides to snow! May make viewing difficult.
278759,lew,2008-12-12 20:24:00,12767,Anyone know what time tonights full moon will set and  hopefully it's after sunrise tomorrow ??
278769,JohnF,2008-12-12 20:44:00,3494, Was there a still involved?  JF

278797,fishermccann,2008-12-12 21:19:00,655,"I work in a long term care facility, and I can tell you that the residents here go wild when there is a full moon, that is not a fable."
278830,Joey,2008-12-12 22:11:00,9122,"Here it comes, and it is BIG and beautiful!!!  Wish I was musky fishing  Joey"
278831,irishfield,2008-12-12 22:14:00,26272, I guess Tybo can't be home...

278841,Sinker,2008-12-12 22:36:00,8692,"Yep, she's a beauty.  I had to snap a quick pic on my way home from work.    You realize that this means winter is really here now right? Break out the ice gear boys and girls......its time to pound some holes  Sinker"
278848,lew,2008-12-12 22:45:00,12767," Not just yet Sinker, there's still one more softwater trip left tomorrow"

278853,Joey,2008-12-12 22:54:00,9122,"Yes, good luck lew, wish I could attend this year     Just wasn't in the cards tho.  Give em heck  Joey"
278872,douG,2008-12-12 23:47:00,2693,"Another astronomical treat that could be seen tonight and for the next two nights is the annual Geminid meteor shower, one of the year’s best displays of shooting stars. Up to 100 meteors an hour can fly across the sky. The meteors, which are easy to spot with the naked eye, appear to shoot out from the constellation Gemini, hence their name, but they can be seen all over the sky. However, with a full moon so bright, the best place to look is away from the Moon.  Meteor showers happen when the Earth passes through clouds of debris shed from comets. As the tiny fragments smash into the Earth’s upper atmosphere at about 100,000mph, they burn up in streaks of light.  For reasons that are not understood, the Geminid meteor showers are tending to grow stronger each year."
278874,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-12-12 23:57:00,1362,"Go get em Lew!!!  ...wish it wasn't so far of a drive for me or I'd be joining you lads!!!  Have fun, be safe in that cold water, and looking forward to a great report!!  Sorry for straying off topic....Yup Glen, this moon tonight is BIG...it's got the entire bay lit up here!!"
278878,Leecher,2008-12-13 00:27:00,7832," Glen here is a shot from the front of my house but I've seen the moon bigger last summer and not as white but more light orange looking, here it is:    Another one:    Got the first real snow storm last Tuesday and Wednesday and here is the results, the view of my deck from the driveway after shoveling:    and the front lawn:    We got 32cm's in the spawn of a day in a half none stop     Tonight their calling for some more snow but a lot less this time...... Going fishing maybe tomorrow on ice"
278905,Greencoachdog,2008-12-13 01:41:00,8163,"What the heck is all that white stuff all over the place Jacques???  ... did y'all have a volcano go off some place close by, and that's the fallout ash???... looks nasty!!!"
