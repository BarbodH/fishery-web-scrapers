279241,jwl,2008-12-14 02:03:00,1056,gonna get off here and watch it right now..I was just waiting for it to start
279245,forrest,2008-12-14 02:12:00,1032,yep....hope its a good show.
279249,pigeonfisher,2008-12-14 02:40:00,696,"When does GSP fight again?  What did you think about dude getting his arm broken the other night?  All the sudden that fight is hard to find on any of the UFC post fight info...  It was a bit strange as he was running around the ring yelling "" I broke it, I broke it...""  Not a real pro."
279250,BUSTER,2008-12-14 02:44:00,1336,"i surprised they dont have more major injuries, running around with a broken arm is just a thing called adrenalin!"
279256,pigeonfisher,2008-12-14 02:54:00,696,It was the guy who broke the other fellas arm running around like a fool.  The guy with the broken arm was nowhere to be found.
279257,BUSTER,2008-12-14 02:56:00,1336,"OHH sorry bud, i missed it"
279258,forrest,2008-12-14 02:56:00,1032,  I think GSP fights late january or feb  Yeah....it was a little uncool to take pride in bending the guys arm like that....btw it ended up being a dislocation.  did you see Corey Hill snap his shin in 2?  He looked like Stretch Armstrong.......owwwww  forrest
279261,Mark Kulik,2008-12-14 03:04:00,348,"I really felt bad for Corey Hill, that kind of injury really sets you back."
279266,BUSTER,2008-12-14 03:16:00,1336,they just said cory had surgery and will be out for 18mths   ouch
279298,forrest,2008-12-14 04:51:00,1032,"A great set of fights, way better than on Wednesday....anyone who missed and wants to see it can watch the instant repeat on Spike TV."
279304,Mark Kulik,2008-12-14 04:59:00,348,"It was a really good card, looks like Erain was ready for Fellipe Nover."
