I restarted the computer but it still says the same thing.  I use Windows XP and IE..........any thoughts, please ??"
278611,Rich,2008-12-12 13:45:00,3927,Funny I just got the same thing as I opened your topic. I run Vista/Firefox  This link may help:  http://www.neoseeker.com/forums/62/t121689...n-file-missing/
278618,Clampet,2008-12-12 14:00:00,1947,"Same here. The first thing to do in these cases is to... visit Google. I found the same answer as Rich got, it sounds like an AVG issue, and hopefully it will be resolved shortly.  Here's is the summary:  Confirmation that the problem is with AVG, as suspected by the fact that everyone was affected at the same time, and not the individual users: This is copied from the AVG Free Forum.  ""Currently the update for AVG Free v8 is corrupted... you will have to wait for AVG Technologies to address the issue with the update.  Reporting the issue again by other users here will not do any good util it is resolved.  The updates that your AVG currently have will still provide the protection it is setup to detect. In otherwords, just getting this update will not make your AVG Free ineffective and as soon as AVG Tech resolves the issue you will be able to update to the current virus definitions at that time.  So in short... please do not post to report the issue, its already known. Also please be patient until AVG Technologies can address the issue.""  The post continues to inform users that their virus protection is not negatively affected by the glitch - AVG is working to fix the problem and users need not worry."
278619,bigfish1965,2008-12-12 14:01:00,3382,It has happened before to me. Open the AVG control and click on the Updates tab and it should update again. May be a bad file in the last update and a patch usually follows the same or next day.

278655,carp-starter,2008-12-12 15:30:00,253,"I have Vista.  I also cannot update AVG – started to happen about 7-9 days ago.  After the update attempt, I get  “Update failed. Invalid Update Control CTF File”  Under “Update Manager” in Overview, I get the same message.  And for Anti-Virus, Anti-spyware, it tells me – “Database is outdated”.  I found a solution at  http://www.winhelponline.com/blog/error-in...-anti-virus-80/  It tells me to delete 2 “.CTF” files.  I did a search and I could not find any “.CTF” or “CTF” values.  carp-starter"
278787,ccmtcanada,2008-12-12 21:04:00,7971,I had the same error.  Missing bin file.  I opened the application and hit update...it downloaded and updated and all seems to be working fine now.
278794,lew,2008-12-12 21:15:00,12767,"I tried a couple times earlier today to update but I kept getting the same message about the missing file, but I just tried again and everything is good now.  As mentioned earlier, it musta been a glitch in AVG"
