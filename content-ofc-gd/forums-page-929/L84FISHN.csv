277663,nancur373,2008-12-09 22:53:00,1211,"Who drives the silver Audi TT with plate L84FISHN. Who ever you are you should have your drivers license revoked untill you learn to drive with courtesy and respect for other people and their lives on the road. This afternoon at approx. 4:30 northbound on Trafalgar Rd. @ Steeles Ave. You blatenly ignored the lane ends sign knowing full well it's there (been for years). You hammered through the intersection, well over the speed limit I might add, and cut me off so bad that I had to damn near lock up my breaks and the car behind me was within inches of smashing into me. Hey, it only takes one wrong move by idiots to put a lot of lives in danger. Learn to drive and show some respect for other motorist. Everyone has somewhere to go and we'd all like to get there safely.  Just my rant for the week.  Curt"
