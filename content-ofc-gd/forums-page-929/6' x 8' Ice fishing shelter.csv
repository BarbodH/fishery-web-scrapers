I bought a Frabill 2 man It cost me 3 times the amount of the Ozark Trail but 3 yrs later its in perfect condition very well made and high quality.
278557,GBW,2008-12-12 04:40:00,8460,Thanks all.  I have wooden hut I can use when I want to go out on the Bog but I figured this may be an option if I want to move from time to time and go to other lakes.  Not any more.  Thanks & cheers.  Geoff
