Now is your last chance to bid on deals of a lifetime. Are you going to pass up one of these wonderful, generous deals or are you going to take advantage of some of these opportunities?"" Get your bids in because this is your last chance, a dollar is all it takes to be the high bidder!""  http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/index.php?showforum=42"
