278447,Radnine,2008-12-12 00:03:00,1538,"Hi all, My boat came with a speedo and tach. In smaller size is the gas gauge and two blank spots. What instuments would go in these small spaces? Thanks Jim"
278448,BassAsin,2008-12-12 00:06:00,806,i know my boat had an oil pressure guage and a voltage meter for my batteries
278462,hirk,2008-12-12 00:24:00,571,Trim and water pressure.Approx $50 each for the kits.
278534,2 tone z71,2008-12-12 03:07:00,1311,"fuel ,trim, water pressure ,volt meter,engine temp could go on for awhile ,you dont really need it"
278536,irishfield,2008-12-12 03:12:00,26272,Motor under warantee??... you're good !
278537,canadianboy,2008-12-12 03:14:00,83,a hours meter if you want one just a good idea for maintenance purposes.
278539,jwl,2008-12-12 03:18:00,1056," that's it right there  my dash has speedo,tach,compass,12 volt outlet...no built in gas tank so no fuel guage...there are spots in the dash where a couple other instruments would fit into...but can't really see needing them for anything......tach is a good reference that your boat is operating under nominal rpm's range as per your owners manual"

278600,Jer,2008-12-12 13:08:00,1426,"I've got the same console in my Crestliner.  In the two extra spaces I've got a volt meter for the cranking battery and also a ""sure-start"" gauge that came with my Johnson outboard. Basically a set of idiot lights for low oil, no oil, motor overheat, etc."
278615,Rizzo,2008-12-12 13:56:00,4754,a mirror so you can see how awesome you look driving a boat
278687,Billy Bob,2008-12-12 16:23:00,5865,A built in compass would be nice
279093,Radnine,2008-12-13 19:15:00,1538,Not even my boat (which is a beaut) can make me look awesome. But it's a lovely thought. Jim
