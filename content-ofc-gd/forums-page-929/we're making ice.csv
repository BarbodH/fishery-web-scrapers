278417,Cudz,2008-12-11 22:27:00,2652,Is the marina or launches (either tiffen or barrie marina) frozen over.  Wanted to get out on Monday (supposed to be milder) on the wter in a boat.  A normal aluminum 12' boat.
278419,Beats,2008-12-11 22:39:00,543,I don't think I'd be going out either in a boat or on the ice at this point.

278484,irishfield,2008-12-12 01:04:00,26272,+8C and Rain for Monday.. ain't gonna help that bit of ice. But is should help knock some snow down or at least hopefully saturate it so it can become slush ice instead of insulation.
278491,danc,2008-12-12 01:17:00,4677,"-25 here tonight. But then it's supposed to warm up. Highs of -8 to -10 average for the next four days with a 90% chance of snow every day. It's that time of year up here. Mild and snowing, or frigid and clear."
278493,misfish,2008-12-12 01:19:00,29133," And will help with the walking to the deer hunting grounds.  Terry stop getting everyones hopes up  . We all know, we wont be out there ""safely"" til mid Jan."
