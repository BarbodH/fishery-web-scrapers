The changes better reflect the commercial products that are available to winter fishing enthusiasts today, and bring the regulations back in line with the practice of previous years.  ''The Ministry has made it easier for Ontarians to get outside and enjoy ice fishing on Ontario's lakes, and that is something we actively support and encourage,'' said O.F.A.H. Executive Director, Mike Reader. ''The changes ensure that winter anglers can take full advantage of the great flexibility that portable ice hut products offer.''  Under the revised regulations, ice hut registration and ice hut removal dates do not apply if the hut is ''...a tent made of cloth or synthetic fabric that has a basal area of seven square metres (or approx. 7'x10') or less when erected.'' This is an increase in size from the previous base area of two square metres, and means that the majority of today's commercially available portable ice huts now fall within these specifications.  The M.N.R. still requires registration of permanent ice huts in many Fisheries Management Zones, and registration numbers must be clearly displayed on the hut. Permanent ice huts must be removed on or before specified dates. It is an offense under the Public Lands Act to leave any ice hut out after ice break up. Anglers are encouraged to check the provincial fishing regulations summary guide for specific details.  The new ice hut regulations take effect immediately, and the changes should appear in the next reprint of the Fishing Ontario 2008-2009 Fishing Regulation Summary.
