278721,TJQ,2008-12-12 18:36:00,7806,"Hey!!  I'm doing some research on PFD's for a friend of mine, and have come upon something unusual... I thought it was the law for kids 12 and under.  That they had to be wearing a life jacket, BUT, for the life of me I can't find any reference to that fact, not even on the govt safe boating site..  http://www.tc.gc.ca/marinesafety/debs/obs/menu.htm  Now I know that they should be wearing them.. but is there a law that says they HAVE TO??  I always thought there was."
278724,fishing n autograph,2008-12-12 18:43:00,2540,I'm not up on the boating and marine legislation but i have a good friend in the  Marine Unit. I can find out if you would like me to.  Dave
278726,Bernie,2008-12-12 18:48:00,3190,I don't believe it is law TJ. Unless it just came out. It would be good practice to get them to wear them though.
278729,BITEME,2008-12-12 18:50:00,1969,As far as I know you only have to have as many in the boat as you have passengers nobody has to wear them ...pretty dumb if you ask me
278732,Roy,2008-12-12 18:53:00,13728,"The law states that there must be a PFD of appropriate size for everyone in the vessel at all times. As far as I know, no one needs to be wearing one. The interesting part in this thing is that there are currently no approved PFDs for children under 20lbs. If all of the above is true, then a child under the age of 10-12 months could never legally be in a boat."

278799,fishermccann,2008-12-12 21:21:00,655,Wow your old! Good Fishing!
278824,jwl,2008-12-12 21:52:00,1056,"that's a good one...I tell my kids that it is the law and they have to wear one until they are 16  , the teenagers bum a little bit but hey....that's my rule!!!  when they where all smaller, my 5 year old included now, they where not allowed on the dock without a pfd on.  and good point about sizes, my kids been in boats since moths old with an ""infants"" pfd, and as for different sizes, well having 3 kids growing up going to the trailer ect..no worries there, I have all assorted sized...infant..toddler, child, junior adult..adult..I think I got it covered..lol, heck it comes in handy at my trailer too when some of the neighbous are goofing off enjoying the summer and they have guests and not enough pfd's to go around...I always offer what ever is available in my shed"
278903,Skud,2008-12-13 01:37:00,739,"It is not law, just strongly recommended by Officers of the law when you cross paths on the water. It will become a law after some horrible loss of a child's life on the water."
278947,forrest,2008-12-13 03:47:00,1032,I don't know what the law is. forget the PDF...make them wear a lifejacket!  Someone mentioned they have not been able to find a PDF for under 20lb life jacket.  Here is a link for an approved infant life jacket 9-25lbs: http://www.mountainbaby.com/item.php/Salus_Bijoux.html  If they are less than 9lbs put them in a bucket and call them bait!  forrest
278950,John Bacon,2008-12-13 04:04:00,3277, Actually a child under 20 pounds does not require PFD.  See attached letter.  http://www.salusmarine.com/transport_canada.html
