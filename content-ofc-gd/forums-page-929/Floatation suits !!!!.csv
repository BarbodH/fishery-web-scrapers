276706,JMahon,2008-12-07 17:08:00,48,The employee gave me no information about when they were going to get some in. As a matter of fact he didn't really seem that interested in helping me at all!  I did recieve a raincheck..But only after I asked for it!
276736,Bondar,2008-12-07 18:29:00,817,"the hole Niagara pennisula never recieved any and the whole GTA doesnt have any i called , no idea why they would sell put something on sale that no one has its crap"
276742,misfish,2008-12-07 18:35:00,29133," Glen With that awesome slime,sorry slim, build,a mustang would fit you best.They are not made for the heavier fells."
276771,fishindevil,2008-12-07 19:34:00,6254,i think the mustang suits are better than the stearns suits !!!! as i stated in my post i was just letting everyone know that they were on sale for a great price before the thread got hi-jacked !!!!!
276784,GBW,2008-12-07 20:09:00,8460,"The logo from the web site is the Nautilus one and all the Durham stores do not have stock either.  I was offered a raincheck though and told when they MIGHT get some in (well after the sale).  Funny how the web price is still $279.99 though.  If anyone find one, can they confirm the brand and if they are any good?  I was about to post on this but I found the hijacked thread so I figured I would just add to the hijacking..."
276815,JMahon,2008-12-07 21:22:00,48,I called today & was told they should be getting some in on the 14th....so I guess we'll find out
276846,forrest,2008-12-07 23:36:00,1032, Go to a Canadian Tire.  Ask the clerk to look the item up in their huge marketing binder.....all details will be in there.  forrest
276867,douG,2008-12-08 00:15:00,2693,"This is my float suit, branded Nautilus 1000.    By the description on the Helly page, they are identical, apart from some colouring on cuffs and other badging.  I fully recommend this suit or one like it.  It's warm, soft, protective, roomy, well engineered, life supporting, fully approved, and with a touch of neoprene.  Just like SWMBO (She Who Bust Be Obeyed).  Oh yeah, the best part is that it has suspenders built in, so that the suit hangs off the straps instead of strangling your neck."
276914,Greencoachdog,2008-12-08 01:32:00,8163," Hijacked is such a nasty word Shawn... let's just say ""taken astray""..."
278788,GBW,2008-12-12 21:04:00,8460,Did anyone ever get one?  Considering the new flyer starts tomorrow...
278803,wuchikubo,2008-12-12 21:26:00,1114,"My brother went to the store near his place and found out the floatation suit was NOT a brand named item and although it was Transport Canada approved, it didn't have any indication that it was Canadian Coast Guard Approved. There was no reflective strips on the suits either. I told him I'd take a pass on the item, I've got my Mustang Floatation suit that still fits (as of spring anyways)."
278825,JMahon,2008-12-12 21:59:00,48,"My store finally got them in...but they were definately NOT the Nautilus suits I was expecting...the were an all red suit with a it of grey, branded the name ""Keep A Float"".     Needless to say I was not impressed...so I went out & bought the Helly Hanson Delta one piece suit instead!"
278835,BITEME,2008-12-12 22:29:00,1969," Dude I hope you dont plan on going to Lakair after saying that he""s gonna be humpin your leg now!"
278966,moemoe,2008-12-13 05:54:00,352,"Bills bait in Hamilton is selling a once piece suit Helly Hansen for I believe $179, it's on my wish list for under the tree"
278991,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-12-13 11:46:00,1362,That's a sweet deal....I paid $280 for my Helly suit 3 years ago!!
279105,GBW,2008-12-13 19:38:00,8460,thanks for the replies folks.  I guess the helly hansen one for $229 at Tromblys is a good deal then.  Luckly my bro-in-law is around the same build as me so I can get him to go try it on and get it for me if they are the best price.
276310,fishindevil,2008-12-06 17:35:00,6254,"Went to hirks marine,in northeast oshawa,for a few things and he has the mustang floatation suits on for sale at $249.99 !!!!!and jackets for $159.99...thats a good deal for sure,so i just thought i would pass the info along....cheers"

276335,misfish,2008-12-06 18:28:00,29133," LOL Wally world here, had them marked down to 150 in the spring ""8 inch"". I should of bought them,but had no need. You have to wonder what they really paid for them if they can drop to that price."

276403,wuchikubo,2008-12-06 20:22:00,1114,"Time out MH and GCD, stop hijacking this thread.  Back to the thread, can any one make out the brand from CTC?"
276407,modny,2008-12-06 20:29:00,502,its probably sterns
276408,ccmtcanada,2008-12-06 20:30:00,7971,Stan....can't make out the brand from the online picture....but the description does say it's approved by Transport Canada.  The new sale started today....so this may not be on sale anymore...
276411,modny,2008-12-06 20:32:00,502,they are probably stearns
276416,misfish,2008-12-06 20:42:00,29133,"Dont say I didnt go the extra mile here for ya,s. I phoned the Mapleview store to find out the brand,they had no clue,and also,all the stores here were already sold out.Here to Orrilla."
276418,e-z-out,2008-12-06 20:46:00,1052,Sold out already   lucky for me i picked my suit 4 months ago

276527,JMahon,2008-12-07 01:17:00,48,"If you check out the CTC website, the suit has a patch on it, which looks like the Nautilus logo.    BUT... Good luck finding one of the suits in stores, I went today in St Thomas & as usual, they didn't have any...But I got him to check for other stores & absolutely no stores in London/St.Thomas or surrounding area have any in stock whatsoever!!!      So if that's not misleading, I don't know what is!!!    Thinking about contacting Head office & complaining....how can you have a sale/advertise an item that none of your stores even have??"
276533,Greencoachdog,2008-12-07 01:29:00,8163,"Getting back on topic, I've been lookin' on the web for them today. Alot of places are out of stock and the cheapest I can find is $340 for the Stearns Commander or $350 for the deluxe Mustang, lots of places are 4 or $500.  There are no places here to buy them locally... these Rednecks around here have never heard of them and don't know what they are!  I'm just wondering which is the better suit, the Stearns or the Mustang?"
276606,Fisherman,2008-12-07 05:01:00,7201,"Yup, that's the one."
276610,forrest,2008-12-07 05:16:00,1032," The computer system the CTC employees use has a lot of inventory info including item receive date, order dates and backorders.  So from that they can tell you how many they sold too. Did the CTC guy say when they were getting them in?  Did they give a raincheck?  The flyers are planned in advanced and stock does not always make it in on time.  forrest"
