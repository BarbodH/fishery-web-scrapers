278061,ccmtcanada,2008-12-11 00:28:00,7971,"Bly and I were really hoping to have another banner season shore fishing for walleye, but it just wasn't in the cards for this year.  Our numbers were way down over the past two years, but we managed a few.  We figured out that we only went out about 1/3 of the number of times we did in past years.  The weather and water temps close to shore didn't help.  The waters were very warm til the end of October...we needed much colder water to bring them close to shore.  Also, the abundant bait fish we've seen in years past were scarce at best!!!  Couple those things with just plain crappy weather, big waves, chocolate milk waters, and ultra clear waters on most of the days we did make it out, it just wasn't our year.  Here are a few pics of some that we did manage to trick into striking out bait...only posting the 10+ pounders for the report.  Sorry about the photo editing on this pic.  I was up north helping a friend winterize a cabin when Bly went out.  She managed the heaviest one of the season for us.  A 32"" 13lb 4oz beauty!   I didn't get my first one until the first week of November.  She beat my fish by a mere 2oz...LOL.  This was also 32"", and was 13lb 2oz.   Another night, when I was practicing for a gig with a band, she pulled this one in...a friendly person passing by took this pic for her.  This measured 29.5"" and was 10 1/4 pounds.   Bly also managed her personal best pike on one night we were out there.  When it hit, we knew right away it wasn't a walleye...it was fighting wayyy to hard...LOL.  This PB was 33"" and weighed just a tad under 10 pounds.   All in all, we had a great fall...all those muskie we caught more than made up for the lacking walleye this season!!"
278065,Greencoachdog,2008-12-11 00:38:00,8163,Well it's aboot dang'-frackin' time!!! Beautiful fish!!!  I notice how you put the long arm stretch on your fish to make them look almost as big as bly's!  Thanks for takin' the time to post that Cliff.. much appreciated Bubba!!!
278069,ccmtcanada,2008-12-11 00:46:00,7971, Thanks Glen...LOL...I'm busted...here's a pic of that same fish... 
278074,Joey,2008-12-11 00:53:00,9122,"Well that's it, beginner's luck is ova my friend     Its all downhill from here on in  Some nice pickerel there for both of you, good going!  Joey"
278080,walleyejigger,2008-12-11 01:00:00,876,"might not have been a banner year for u but impressive and something to be proud of nonetheless, congrats"
278091,solopaddler,2008-12-11 01:19:00,8605,"Awesome fish guys, wow!"
278105,Hubbard,2008-12-11 01:36:00,22,"wow I wish my ""not so good"" fall was that good. Congrats on the very nice fish."
278107,Leecher,2008-12-11 01:37:00,7832,"Great report and pics Cliff  You guys sure had a great season, may not have caught them in great numbers but the ones you caught are quality ones.  Look at the size of them walters    and from shore.... Congratulations to both of you  Thanks for taking the time to put this report together and sharing it with us Leechman"
278117,hammercarp,2008-12-11 01:53:00,964,It's seems it was a tough fall for all bank fishers. But those are some nice fish. Congradulations and thanks the post.
278123,Greencoachdog,2008-12-11 02:13:00,8163,"  What the heck you gonna do with that pic Cliffy???... that fish was caught too long ago to be entered into the tourney!   ... btw, how do those big ol' lake O Wall-ices taste when you do them up Sushi style???"
278146,ehg,2008-12-11 03:33:00,2666,"Those are some huge walleyes!  At least you are still catching them, congrats to both of you on some great fishing. The fish in the second pic has a blue-ish tinge to it.   Thanks for sharing those, ehg"
278157,Wild,2008-12-11 03:59:00,704,You can't complain about catching quality fish like those big ones guys!
278178,young_one,2008-12-11 06:12:00,620,"Impressive catches! Some people like myself, have never caught Walleye or Pike of that size, even from a boat. Extra points for getting it from shore! Hmmm, night time is definitely the tip here!"
278221,Carp,2008-12-11 13:15:00,1488,Your mediocre fall walleye season is still impressive Cliff. I'll take any one of those fish in a season and be very happy.  Thanks for sharing your pics of the pics.
278260,troutologist,2008-12-11 14:42:00,951,I got a kick out of that post. the lead in had me thinking it was a tough season....then only posting the 10+ fish.  Good work! You guys have that fall pattern pretty dialed in.
278272,tbayboy,2008-12-11 15:24:00,1497,May not be your best fall but still a whole lot better than most of the rest of us.  Congrats to the both of you for another nice set of giant fish.
278287,The Urban Fisherman,2008-12-11 15:58:00,2050,"wow - look at how healthy both of bly's fish look!! - seems fitting as she is much prettier than you are Cliff!  I agree with TbayBoy - I wouldn't complain about a 13lb walleye if it was the only one I caught in my life! lol  Cheers, UF"
278564,snag,2008-12-12 05:10:00,1932,"First,  Thanks for the sneak preview  Second,  And you'll have to agree, along with others,  I can't believe a REPORT has been side-tracked with other NF's?????    I know the effort you've put in to catch those fish. I know that this year has been unusually slow (which makes your catches that much more rare) I've seen my catches drop 50% from 2 years ago. Very, Very discouraging  It's hard out there folks, for these fish, in this year. Specifically, in this region. I don't know why.  Impressive Cliff and Carole. "
278567,jwl,2008-12-12 05:21:00,1056,"I have read a bunch of your reporst since signing up here..you folks had a great season by anyone's standards, and a nice multispecies collection along the way...those are toad walleye in anyone's books"
278584,MCTFisher9120,2008-12-12 12:04:00,3761,Nice Job you two! Congrads on the big walleye.
278598,msp,2008-12-12 13:04:00,1336,"CCMT, Nice fish, thanks for the report. Some true giants there.I have two questions.........Do they fight any better from shore than they do from a boat? We all know that they really do fight like wet socks. Also,what baits did you get them on? Im just wondering if any particular colors work better at night. Thanks again for the porn.     MSP"
278679,ccmtcanada,2008-12-12 16:13:00,7971," Thanks MSP!  Hmm...about the fight.  If you count one...maybe two headshakes, and then reeling in a log any better then yes...LOL.  The big difference is we're pulling them up from about 6 to 9 feet of water with little line out rather than from 25 to 30 feet with a few hundred feet of line out there!  As for bait...bly and I use wally divers and my fav are jointed shad raps...#5 and #7.  Colours are all over the map.  I believe it's the shape, rattling and silhouette that matters most at night."
278802,fishermccann,2008-12-12 21:26:00,655,"I agree with everyone else GREAT fish , from shore? General area?"
278809,douG,2008-12-12 21:35:00,2693,"Great report, Cliff.  Nice fish for both you and Carole.  I think it was the mauve nailpolish that fooled them wallies."
