278395,charlesn,2008-12-11 21:32:00,551,"Auto door locks and auto ignition are safety features.  Some ladies (and maybe men too) feel safer with them.  The keys locked in the truck with the engine running while at a launch ramp happened to me at a tournament and luckily due to the less than tight tolerances of the vehicle, a friend was able to pry the door open enough to jam a stick down and press the power door locks.  Not sure what I woulda done if that wasn't an option.  Also, this used to happen to me a tonne (or so it seemed) when I had manual windows on my GMC Sierra.  Sitting there in the left lane, someone pulls up on the right side rolls down their window and starts asking for directions or whatever.  Couldn't reach over and undo the window with my seltbelt on so I had to resort to pseudo sign language that looked like I was an out of work Mime or something.  Not a huge deal, but a pain when I could've simply helped a fellow traveler out if I had power windows.  I will never get another vehicle without power windows or door locks."
278412,misfish,2008-12-11 22:12:00,29133," Man, did I get a good laugh out of that one Chuck.  I just open my  drivers door,step out  on the rocker panel,raise my head over the roof(opps that maybe a problem for you   ) And yell over to them, what they need to know. Yep call me a redneck  "
278540,danc,2008-12-12 03:23:00,4677,"They all end up in the junk yard 15 years down the road anyways. Awesome when they're new, but junk a few years down the road. An incredible waste of our intelligence and our resources."
278554,hammercarp,2008-12-12 04:22:00,964,Blasphemy!   They'll get you for dissing the sacred cow of north america.
278083,walleyejigger,2008-12-11 01:07:00,876,"hand crank on my truck thank you, nothin worse then opening an electric window in -30 weather and not being able to close it again, (if ur able to open it at all)  when i specified that to the salesman he looked at me funny and said ""why would you want that?"" i said cause i'm not that lazy, and he got insulted.....oops  what burnt me was to get a sliding rear window i HAD to get semi tint windows, jerk0ff$  maybe they should join the big 3 together and have 1 truck like u say with all the optins, and one without, and thats it, 4x4 shouldnt be an option but required"
278088,misfish,2008-12-11 01:18:00,29133," Hey Charles I have been in some of them too(helpping out with launching) Man they are sweet,but are they really needed?????? Guess if yer posh (sp?) yeah I guess you do. A basic full size pick up with a cap, would be suffisint for any angler,weather he be a common sport fisher or a tournment angler.   You do know those things are against the law right? LOL J/K"
278092,Bernie,2008-12-11 01:19:00,3190,Couple things come to mind on this Brian. First of all the option list was a way for the salesmen/women to up their commission. Secondly the plain vehicles were a hard sell (at least they were anyway). I once worked for a dealership and up until recently not much changed.
278095,hammercarp,2008-12-11 01:22:00,964,"Haven't you learned anything. Your so called free market got us into this mess. The second thing is the ""free market"" is just as much crap as Marx's communist utopia. It does not work. I have personal real world experience with this and believe a ""free market"" sucks. I dug this up from a post I made on another forum. Have any of you experienced or seen a ""free market""? I have and the results were bad for everybody. I work in the sign business and have been involved with portable signs. Those are the tempory signs used by businesses to advertise generally on the side of the road. They are supposed to be used for a short period of time and then taken down. Here is what happened here.These type of signs were a new thing here about fifteen years ago. One company, the one I am currently working for was one of the first to offer them to businesses. After awhile the city of Hamilton tried to regulate then by passing some by-laws. The guy I currently work for took the city to court and got an injunction against the by-law. The city did not want to spend any more money on this and so there were no laws governing the use of these signs. It was now a defacto free market. In a few years this was the result. The company I work for basically quit doing portables in Hamilton because prices spiralled downward and it was no longer profitable. They never made back any of the money they spent on lawyers. There were so many portable signs out there that they were virtually useless as advertising media. They were so crowded together that nobody could read them. The merchants only used them because they were cheap so everyone had one out and they didn't want to lose their spot. Everybody that could slap some boards together had a portable sign business and plenty went out of business. They left their junkie signs sitting there. Some merchants bought their own portable signs. These deteriorated and became derelics because there was no maintainance done on them. Property managers and landlords either banned their use or let their tenants do what ever they wanted. Certain sections of the city really started to look like crap. The result of a completely free market was bad news for everyone. The city looked like hell. Merchants spent money on advertising that provided no return. Portable sign companies had large numbers of signs that made no profit and they could not get rid of them do to the money they had tied up in their inventory of signs and letters. The company that I work for ( the one that created the free market) did business in other cities and towns that had by-laws regulating portable signs. And guess what? The business thrived in a regulated market and has greatly expanded into other aspects of the sign and graphic business. The city of Hamilton, where I live has passed new sign by-laws and the mess is being cleaned up. The sign business I work for is doing more business in the city. At a profit. This is the real world that I have worked in for the last ten years. So much for ""free markets"" I say you can keep em. Laissez faire business died a hundred years ago and I hope it stays buried."
278096,irishfield,2008-12-11 01:24:00,26272, Lexx has got them.. and no damn electric locks either! Makes it harder to break in with a coat hanger! LOL
278101,misfish,2008-12-11 01:29:00,29133," Maybe the times will change Bernie. They got to,how long can we go along with this? Take boats these days. They come basic then they say, you can get this, and that ,then all of a sudden,that and this, become another 4 thou dollars. If we went out and bought the additions later on, and on sale,we save.  Did you know, they want 1200 bucks for a CD player as an upgrade at the dealership? what the heck is that?  Yep,commision."
278110,OhioFisherman,2008-12-11 01:38:00,6623,"We as a society, most have gone way beyond our reach?  Brian I don`t disagree with that, but who set the example? Since 1980 most workers pay has been lucky to double? What could possibly make these CEO`s think their pay should go up by such a vast amount? It is the same for the Auto industry and most other businesses here.   Connie I tend to disagree, better to hire the cops before the crime spree? Some one should have stepped in long before now, but political contributions can be blinding? I don`t have any answers, Washington seems to put out some lame ones.  I don`t like the bailouts, the reasons given for them even less, and the concept of a CEO making more than the President of this country less than that.  Never saw the need for a fancy car or boat, a roof over my families head that was paid for was Mission Accomplished! Only reason I won`t buy a stick shift now is cars don`t shift as well with out using the clutch as trucks, and my left leg has a mind of it`s own.  Like anything different opinions, and I can`t and won`t say mine is right, just my view better more are living comfortably than the chosen few. I may have to much also? But it`s paid for and I never thought I was worth more than the guy working next to me, the cop or fireman, heck even the trash dude.  Already told the wife when I croak no suit, burn my butt on some old pallets in the back field and have a pig roast and a couple kegs! I don`t need the beer either. At that point dry might be a good thing?"
278120,misfish,2008-12-11 01:56:00,29133,"  Yep,how much can that cost.LOL   I wont even start to ask about that.LOL  Thanks Paul for the replies.  Holly crapolla HammerCarp,thats a post and a half. Not sure it,s what I meant/looking for,but holly molly.Good points.  All I wanted to know is,if the big three built basic and just one big one, would it be better?   SHESSH"
