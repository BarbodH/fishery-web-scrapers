278165,T Fisher,2008-12-11 04:41:00,139,"I am gonna buy one of the above, but having trouble making the plung with both being the same price around $500. Which unit is better for the money.  Any imput is appreciated."
278168,Beats,2008-12-11 05:10:00,543,"LX-5 is what I have.   Again, do a forum search and you will see these comparisons/debates come up fairly regularly."
278184,danbo,2008-12-11 10:44:00,2646,The NEW  King of Flashers.... drumroll please..  http://store.humminbird.com/humminbird-pro...od407040-1.html
278206,Grimace,2008-12-11 12:10:00,2020,I have the fl-18.  I love it. Amazing unit.  But it doesn't touch the lx-5.  Marcum.
278269,Uncle Buck,2008-12-11 15:22:00,1000,"Marcum LX5 hands down...  the 08's are even better, here's what the marcum tech emailed me... "
278274,danbo,2008-12-11 15:28:00,2646,Hey Unc..can ya get us a deal on 'em?
278307,Uncle Buck,2008-12-11 17:29:00,1000,get a bunch of you guys together... then go and see Blake at Fishing World...  He should be able to help ya out...  I've got 2 s-cables for sale for the FL8 & FL18 at discount prices though...
278509,irishfield,2008-12-12 01:45:00,26272,So why are these better than my Lowrance 102C Goran? It puts out 2400 W P/P and I bought an ice fishing transducer for it to narrow the cone and to get better returns than using my transom puck on a stick.
278538,Laker272,2008-12-12 03:15:00,45,I picked up my new Marcum LX5 a couple weeks ago. Hopefully I get to test her out this weekend. I did quite a bit of research and concluded that this unit is way above anything else out on the market.
278671,Uncle Buck,2008-12-12 15:50:00,1000," Not saying it's better, if i were to do it again, i'd probably buy the cabelas lowrance 522 combo for $550  how much was your sonar wayne? probably $500+, now add an ice transducer(dual cone, if available) $100, and a battery $30,and a charger $15 and a case $20 so you're at $665 minmum, add tax... $750 and you have to put it together... case/battery/sonar...  picked up my lx5 for $480 US, came to $550 CDN on the visa... that's $200 difference and it's good to go out of the box  between an FL18/FL20 and an LX5, i'd still go with the LX5"
278682,irishfield,2008-12-12 16:18:00,26272,"Oh I know I've got money into it Goran... but it was already on the boat, so only EXTRA cost to go ice fishing, a battery and a plastic case. Worked okay with the transom transducer.. just hoping it works perfect with the ice fishing transducer that I got off ebay for $80 brand new.  Just wanted to know if there was something about these Vex/Marcum units that makes them unique for ice fishing."
278715,Uncle Buck,2008-12-12 18:10:00,1000,"i took my humminbird matrix 17 sonar out on the ice my first year... screen froze/dissappeared at -20 i believe ( no hut/no heater) now if ice fishing in -40 outside of a hut, what happens to your screen? not sure if a screen/lcd can crack due to cold weather or if it just goes blank... but flashers are basically made for ice fishing...many people like graphs for ice fishing...  next is interference? the x67 is supposed to be terrible for interference from other sonars?? i don't need to tape a heat pack on the back of my marcum to make sure i get an image..."
278786,irishfield,2008-12-12 21:04:00,26272,"That picture is from a -29C morning were none of our sleds, terry's 4 wheel or my truck wanted to start Goran!"
278836,Terry,2008-12-12 22:29:00,14456,it sure was cold
279064,T Fisher,2008-12-13 17:49:00,139,Thanks guy's
