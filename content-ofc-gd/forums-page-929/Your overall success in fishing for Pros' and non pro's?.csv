278668,dp3200,2008-12-12 15:43:00,31,"I think it helps to start out when you're young. Kids tend to explore a lot more things...this gives a good groundwork for success. As you get older you mature in your fishing practices and learn a lot more technical skills, which are also important.  I read a book not long ago called ""Outliers: The Story of Success"", where the author (Gladwell) researched just what it was that made successful people the way they are. In every case it is a combination of talent, luck and hard work. For example, he talks about the 10 thousand hour rule. Basically, he argues that anyone who has ever truly mastered something has put in a solid 10 thousand hours of work to get there. Yes, Mozart was composing before he had 10 thousand hours, but it wasn't until he reached 10 thousand hours that his work became refined... it even took him 10 thousand hours to develop mastery. His earlier stuff was impressive for his age, but not ""the best"". The same goes for everything else.  Raw talent + hard work. No question about it."
278672,bushart,2008-12-12 15:51:00,2628,This is easy......I'm Just Better Than All You Guys!!! (Of Course LOL)  There is no single item that completes this picture...to be successful you need all that has been stated but here's my hit list  Drive & Desire--Instinct--Confidence---Experience and a good memory (Slowly fading)--listening and learning from those that have had success (Do not necessarily have to be dressed in Tourney Togs--Good info can come from anywhere and willingness to apply it is key)--Has to be fun or why bother?----quality equipment (Within your budget)---Then don't forget to pass on to others what you have found.  Now don't get me started why I'm a better hunter.......  Bushart
278677,The Urban Fisherman,2008-12-12 16:09:00,2050,"Been fishing since I could stand on my own two feet, obsessed ever since, learned a ton from my father, then moved away and trial and error was the name of the game, learned some things on the internet, and even more when I found OFC.  I've gone leaps and bounds since I started working for Mercer - He's an endless pit of knowledge and experience, and you know what....I still get skunked all the time!    But I have a blast doing it and always will...."
278702,Dozer,2008-12-12 17:34:00,896,"Knowledge / experience and talent / ""finesse"".  And yes, a little bit of luck."
278710,bassfighter,2008-12-12 17:50:00,366,"It is wonderful to hear the passion, dedication, and hard work that you guys put into this hobby/sport.  I also believe that it takes the right type of in born personality, right influence, up bringing and right environment that has also helped us reach a level of our accomplishment.  This OFC board has brought many of us together for the single reason, to share our enjoyment and challenges on this fishing sport, through sharing and working together, the sport have brought out the best in each and every one of us.  It is my prayer for this Christmas that our fishing resources will never dwindle down in the near future, I wish we all continue to strive to improve another notch, and our passion for the sport never cease, to know when to conserve our limited resources for the enjoyment of the next generation.  Passion + Hard work + Some Talent + Willing to take risk + some luck = Success!"
278712,BITEME,2008-12-12 17:53:00,1969,JUST FISH DAMN IT TIME TIME TIME
278720,anders,2008-12-12 18:34:00,1168,"- Be versatile.  it has been said on here already im sure.  If something isnt working...try a different technique, trolling pattern, lure, etc. - Try new spots as well...if you fish in a lake and you know you can catch em in certain spots, try a different spot!  Never know. - Confidence is a must for me.  If i know a lure works it stays in the water longer, rather than a lure with the ol cliche ""I have never caught em on that"". - Spend time on the water.  If you are not out there, you are not learning!  - One last thing,  try that ""I never caught em on that"" lure.  You will be pleasantly surprised sometimes!"
278822,irishfield,2008-12-12 21:51:00,26272,Success... what's that?
278886,mikeh,2008-12-13 00:48:00,824,"my sucess this year was the fact that I have been on certain lakes before and I always try different spots and shorelines all the time. One of the best tips I received was at Tim Horton's at 5:30 in the morning in Midland from a local fisherman , I used his tips and added to it and really enjoyed  fishing there this year.  This past year I fished with Tbayboy alot and since he likes changing his baits all the time I would wait until he would catch 3 fish in a row and then I would change to the bait he was using hahaha."
278980,Rich,2008-12-13 08:38:00,3927, Maybe we can get Dave to take us steelheading? haha
278981,Rich,2008-12-13 08:42:00,3927," Well there is, but it's more like freak accidents happening.. but the ability to adapt and learn from luck - maybe thats another mark of an angler.  For instance, one day Sleded and I were having a terrible late fall day, tossing grubs, crankbaits, finesse baits.. basically all slow moving lures. Sleded had brought a rod with a spinnerbait on it before the day started and hadn't casted it yet, but somehow the spinnerbait ended up dislodged from his reel seat and was hanging about 2 inches over the water. Suddenly we hear SPLASH beside the boat. He had caught the first bass of the day on the rod he wasn't using. lol It jumped out of the water right next to the boat to grab a hanging spinnerbait.  We caught 16 bass that late October day on buzzbaits."
278466,jwl,2008-12-12 00:28:00,1056,"I think it's all experimenting and learning along the way.  I have fished avidly since I was a little kid..was lucky enough to grow up spending every summer travelling to somewhere in the north and camping, fishing for a couple weeks every summer.  I also grew up fishing for just about everything all over the Niagara region.  Mostly the grown-ups would just leave us kids to our own accord and just goof off fish and have a good time. Then as I got a bit older, knew how to swim well ect and my mom thuoght it was ok, that was it..off on my bike all over the place 3-4-5 days a week fishing, sometimes even twice in the same day.  Soon using a bobber for panfish turned into using lures, bigger bait, minnows..fishing creeks and  the River instead of a pond ect and it all started coming together from there.    As kids we looked around at what all the gorwn-ups where using and catching fish on and started from there by copying some of thier actions.  As the years go by..more fish caught, more species conquered, and more season fished, I started keeping fishing journals and keeping track of even the most minute detail for the day..the date..the weather...the time...the water conditons...general report on the surrounding area....water temps if I could...forage available...ect..and so on..and over time I have come to develope patterns that let me catch a variety of fish as thier availability and so forth come ibto factor throughout the year....there isn't a month of the year I don't do some type of fishing for the most part I probably average a good 200 days or so fishing a year..some years a little less, some even more..to become a more successful angler you have to be willing to oput in the time, and face many tough days along the way..scrapes, cuts, bruises, and skunk days, over come, adapt, and most of all just get out there and keep trying...just because one guy catches a toone more fish than you..doesn't mean that someone else isn't catching a tonne more fish than that guy"
278483,irishfield,2008-12-12 01:01:00,26272,  Ya you're right Andy... I didn't see any eyes on Lucky !
278488,steverowbotham,2008-12-12 01:11:00,1800, we think much alike
278620,Rich,2008-12-12 14:03:00,3927,Experience is the greatest teacher. More time on the water = more learned.  You must be willing to try new things and new spots regularly. Changing almost constantly until you feel confident in all aspects of what you do. Then you move on to something else that's new. That constant eagerness to learn mixed with the time on the water to learn it.. that's what makes a great fisherman.
278624,ccmtcanada,2008-12-12 14:13:00,7971,"Agree with what everyone is saying...experience, natural talent...all comes into play.  Have I been skunked this year?  Oh yeah...lots of times, on shore.  One thing that hasn't really been mentioned is confidence.  For me, confidence in your lure, your line, your setup, your skill is as critical as all the other things."
278635,Rizzo,2008-12-12 14:37:00,4754, hahaha...if that's the case Lew can I borrow those nice rainbow baits you've prepared for tomorrow?
278642,Leecher,2008-12-12 14:58:00,7832,"I agree with what everyone is saying also and will add ""instinct""  what I mean by that is being able to determine where to go on a new lake that you never fished before.  I've been fishing since I'm old enough to cast a lure with a rod and fished a lot of lakes and was for the most part  successfull at it.  Leechman"
278646,lew,2008-12-12 15:01:00,12767," Roger, if the black & orange work the way I'm hoping, I'll GIVE you the rainbows"
278653,kemper,2008-12-12 15:28:00,2232,"There is no such thing as luck,  Experience is number one IMO, knowing the conditions and what has worked for you in the past will shape what bait you throw on any given day. Also experience on the water body is huge, especially in steelheading. For example on my home river I can 9 times out of 10 pin down where the fish are holding, because I have spent countless hours out there, but if you take me to a new river I wont know exactly where they are and what they want. I might be able to put a good guess together and be successful but not to the same extent as I would be if I knew the water.  Prep is huge too, I spend a ton of time getting all my gear together before any trip. Every colour of bait, every type I think might work goes into the box/vest. Knowing the water conditions before you go is huge too, for example if I am going steelheading tomorrow, I am not only going to check the hydro charts but im also going to drive to the river today (its close) and see the water first hand. That way I know what I need to bring, and what I dont.  last but not least, OFC. Im serious, I would not be half the fisherman that I am today without this place. When I was 13 I joined, and since then I have been on a constant learning curve in getting out fishing with members and just reading endlessly. This place rocks"
