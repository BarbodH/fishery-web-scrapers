Most areas that I checked that are non-current areas and typically have the first ice only had about 2"" or a little under.  The spud would go through on the second hit.  I did find one spot where it was 4"" and Ryan and I will be checking it out further tomorrow morning.  I made it out 80 yards or so today, but the water was shallow still and I didn't want to go too much further without having someone with me.  I'll keep you posted, but I wouldn't recommend it out there yet.  Stay safe, and pray for cold!  I know... the guys in the boats at the ferry are praying against me.  Jeff"
