278789,lew,2008-12-12 21:05:00,12767," Cause nobody ever caught a musky while sitting at home in front of a nice warm fire on a cold day, that's why we do these things, Wayne"
278791,irishfield,2008-12-12 21:06:00,26272, COLD FX ! Suck it up bud... I've got a surprise in the boat so it won't be that bad! lol
278793,Terry,2008-12-12 21:07:00,14456,rum or scotch....LOL
278801,lew,2008-12-12 21:25:00,12767, I think it's called the Niagara Parks Marina if I remember correctly but jwl can give you the proper name and directions when he sees this. I've never driven from the Peace Bridge end so I'd just get you all messed up if I tried.
278805,irishfield,2008-12-12 21:28:00,26272, Dang..never thought of those !
278817,jwl,2008-12-12 21:45:00,1056," If you are coming from the Peace Bridge..just follow the Parkway down river for a few minutes.....you will go through Fort Erie and head toward Niagara..it is just a bit down from the bridge at Frenchman's Creek, can't miss it it's the only one...the Park's doesn't have it any more it is called Miller Creek Marina...you will see a couple bigger boats stored on the property ect..it's really easy to find it's right on the Parkway like 10 minutes or so from the border"
278821,muskeybugged,2008-12-12 21:49:00,282,"Wishing all a safe, fun and successful trip.  Can't wait for the reports.  "
278833,Terry,2008-12-12 22:26:00,14456,"maybe someone can save me looking at the regs I have never fished muskie there how many rods , PER PERSON and what length is an eater fish, I MEAN KEEPER FISH"
278843,irishfield,2008-12-12 22:38:00,26272,"I'm bringing all my downeaster mounts Terry..... I think we can get 9 out if we're careful on line lengths.  We can't shore lunch anything under 44"" !"
278847,jwl,2008-12-12 22:44:00,1056," only 1 rod allowed on the upper...can't eat anything under 44 inches...maybe someone can bring some buns, if we just steak one up that will make quite a few burgers"
278852,Terry,2008-12-12 22:53:00,14456,"thanks and I think I read  in the eating guide that you shouldn't eat muskie over 43"" so I guess I will just release them  LOL"
278861,walleyemen,2008-12-12 23:15:00,316,"Look forward to meeting you all tommorow morning, i'll be there around 7 with JWL clearing the ramp,weather looks o.k so far, remember to dress warm and ask any questions if ya have them.Good to here your coming jose, we meet last year at the fishing show when you bought some lures from me,or maybe that was 2 years ago LOL.

278917,jwl,2008-12-13 02:01:00,1056,"hey a bit last minute....due to some family matters, I had a cancel so I have one open seat if any takers.!!!"
278990,Roy,2008-12-13 11:38:00,13728,You guys have a great and safe time out there.
279000,Spiel,2008-12-13 13:22:00,9065,Brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
279027,Jen,2008-12-13 15:12:00,833,"  I Hate Shopping , LOVE FISHING, so maybe you should be a little more careful with the statements...  I am jealouse you get to go , specially with Irishfield... but then work comes first for me, as I look outside and see how beautiful the day is I wish you all a ton of luck...  See you guys this evening! Good Luck out there  Cheers,  Jen"
279234,e-z-out,2008-12-14 01:51:00,1052,  Jen all women shop even you. You fish you shop for fishing gear  Waynes boat was a blast to be on for a nice cold day like today with the heater going
279235,jwl,2008-12-14 01:57:00,1056," awe come on guys...heater..where's your winter fishing spirit gotta admit ,Wayne's boat is one kick  piece of machine...my boat probably fit's inside it"
279237,e-z-out,2008-12-14 02:02:00,1052,jwl i was freezing my   and i was fishing with 2 young old guys lol
279270,irishfield,2008-12-14 03:26:00,26272,Heater.. what heater... did we have a heater! lol  Made it home lads.... almost didn't but she's tucked away inside covered in slush/brine. Hope they're right about +3 for tomorrow so I can get it hosed down. A real mess up here on the roads.  Great seeing everyone again and meeting some new ones for the first time. Great bunch of folks for sure... even that Fishmaster guy ain't as crusty as he seems ! lol
279278,jwl,2008-12-14 03:49:00,1056,"glad to get the reports of people as they made it home safely, you guysare some real troupers...8 of of travel,8 hours of fishin, and a dinner break in between"
279284,Rizzo,2008-12-14 04:07:00,4754, no kidding. Man what a boat you've got yourself Wayne. Dreaming of being in that thing with you next year is what kept Shawn and I going today...think warm thoughts...think warm thoughts
278334,jwl,2008-12-11 18:37:00,1056," heater shmeater   , if it's anything like today out there, it will be a great wintery day on the water.  I just took a little tour and if the conditions are anything like today we can't ask for much more out of December...pretty much no wind...flat water..and it's green!!!!  What's the preference for launches???....the marina gate is open as of right now....the ramp is going to need some work though..the parking lot and launch are an ice rink, its melting underneath but slick..if this is the choice of spots to put in, tommorrow if it is still icy I will go smash it up and throw a crap load of salt down..then get there early Saturday and so the same.  The small ramp by Frenchman's is pretty good....how many boats we got going out???..asking becasue there is limited parking for trailers there but we can figure it out..  these places are a good place to start from it's probably the most central to some good areas to try"
278393,Rizzo,2008-12-11 21:28:00,4754,"that's great news. Personally, I think the first choice for launching would be the marina. I believe the plan was to meet there at 8 a.m. and only launch elsewhere if it was locked. Everyone bring shovels and salt! I'm so excited about the water clarity I may even be 15 minutes early!"
278411,lew,2008-12-11 22:09:00,12767,"Yup, let's definetely launch at the marina if it's available and won't take you all day to chop away the ice Jack, otherwise we can run down the road to Frenchmens.  I've already got 45 pounds of salt in the back of the truck if we get into trouble."
278442,irishfield,2008-12-11 23:48:00,26272,Terry and I will be there with my boat guys. Looks like snow up here Saturday am.. but not down there so we're gonna go for it. Monday +8C and rain.. so I can wash the mess off the rig them before storing.  I have one spot in the boat available if there's an OFC'r with there own gear that wants to go.... or can even accomodate if they don't. Let me know.. can pick up if on the route or meet at the ramp.  So the Marina.. hope to be there by 7:45.. Lew will you have your cell phone on?
278444,lew,2008-12-11 23:59:00,12767,"Good to hear you guys are gonna make it afterall Wayne, and yes, my cell will be on and I should be there by 7:30 or so.  That should give us 14 guys & 6 boats so it'll be a great day out there.  You boyz gonna be coming to supper too ??"
278464,irishfield,2008-12-12 00:27:00,26272,Yes for a meal Lew ! You cooking the musky burgers or do ya suppose the restaurant will whip them up for us?
278490,lew,2008-12-12 01:17:00,12767,"If we get enough muskies in the morning Wayne, we can haul a couple of them them over to Grand Island for a shore lunch"
278495,irishfield,2008-12-12 01:23:00,26272,Okay.. I'll bring me stove !  Any tips or pointers a first timer on the upper should know.... before drifting down over the falls ?
278499,lew,2008-12-12 01:29:00,12767,"Most important tip for the Upper Niagara Wayne, if you can feel the cold mist on your face and feel the water rumbling under your boat, turn around and head the other way......FAST"
278501,irishfield,2008-12-12 01:32:00,26272,"  ""Paddle Terry... Paddle !! """
278526,jwl,2008-12-12 02:18:00,1056," Don't worry...once you hit the ""restricted water"" past the big white cans on the Upper the Coast Guard will make sure you don't have to paddle, and give ya about a $10,000 lesson on where not to fish  I will be fishing near the launch and upriver so no worries there"
278698,Squid,2008-12-12 17:10:00,1656,"Wayne, I will bring the SD cards for you tomorrow. I am pumped to go fishing!!"
278699,e-z-out,2008-12-12 17:20:00,1052,Well Guys have a good one tomorrow to bad i wont be there dew to no open seats but next year i'll be there on my new boat. Good luck to all and remember to have your flot suits on.
278704,irishfield,2008-12-12 17:35:00,26272,Aile Goby... as stated a page back... I had/have a spot available. I already got a PM though from someone that wanted it... but he hasn't totally confirmed yet. If he backs out do you wanna go? I'm going down the 427.. across the QEW so could pick you up at a major intersection if he backs out.
278711,e-z-out,2008-12-12 17:50:00,1052,That would be great Wayne i'm in if the seat dose open up
278723,Fishmaster,2008-12-12 18:43:00,920,After a long days fishing i know ill be hungry .count me and Sonny for dinner Jen might join as well ... Jen will not be fishing with me and Sonny due to a great Ladie thats going to keep the store Open for the Sale while we fish ...Thanks Jen ...see you boys at the Ramp ...
278737,lew,2008-12-12 19:10:00,12767,"That's excellent Steve, we'll see you & Sonny at the marina at 8:00"
278738,jwl,2008-12-12 19:11:00,1056,"I will be there about 7 or so getting the ramp good to go...shouldn't be too bad..it's decent enough here today so far, and river looks prime!!!!   ..now I just realizes that I need to go out and get a couple containers to get some of my baits more organized...I didn't realize I had such an assortment    Never know what's gonna be working, hate to find out I left the lucky stuff at home  ..I think it takes me more time to get my stuff together than it does to get my boat ready"
278740,lew,2008-12-12 19:14:00,12767,"There's probably 50 baits in the box I'm bringing tomorrow Jack, but it's only gonna take one of them"
278744,muskeybugged,2008-12-12 19:25:00,282," Go for it, I'm out....  Thanks anyway"
278752,e-z-out,2008-12-12 19:57:00,1052,Sorry to hear your not going. I'll be more then happy to take the seat with wayne.
278776,irishfield,2008-12-12 20:51:00,26272,PM sent back to you Jose !  Trailering cover is on... truck's attached and ready to go at 4am ! Man.. why do we do these things ! lol
278782,e-z-out,2008-12-12 21:01:00,1052,We do it for the love of the sport. Women have there shopping we have our fishing
278784,Terry,2008-12-12 21:03:00,14456,"and I woke up this morning with a bit of a cold at this point the nose is running and I feel like crap  I am sure I will be all better by morning, if not the day may not be as much fun as I was hoping...LOL"
278785,corvette1,2008-12-12 21:03:00,1765,does the marina have a name ? is it across from beaver island? thanks
275463,jwl,2008-12-04 17:31:00,1056," I will see if I can scrounge up a couple of those portable carports  no worries, if needed I will clean the ramp the Friday and head over early on the day of"
276040,Jen,2008-12-06 01:15:00,833,Me Fishmaster & Sonny will be there ...whats the plain afterwards ...there is a Swill in St Catherines for NFN's site anybody from here going to that ...
276043,lew,2008-12-06 01:30:00,12767,"Good to hear you guys are gonna be joining us Jen, and we'll be having supper in one of the local restaurants in Fort Erie.  We'll see you at the Frenchmens Creek ramp at 8:00 AM"
276061,Jigger,2008-12-06 02:01:00,1237,"Hey guys, just a stab on this one to see if anyone has a spot open for the M&G? I'd love to join in, but my boats only a 14fter and even though its a Lund I'd rather not take any more risks than necessary, especially on new water. Thanks."
276063,jwl,2008-12-06 02:05:00,1056," I am gonna show for that one for a bit after fishin and dinner, the swill is to try to do a little something for Rick O's cause for those who might be interested  As for the guy with the 14 footer, if it's a good deep solid boat it's not probs we aren't really fishing in super fast rough water..just a thought...my boat is full for the day or I would open a seat..I already opened it up to 2 people"
276195,lew,2008-12-06 11:27:00,12767,"Jigger, I hope your able to join us, it's always a great day."
276274,Jigger,2008-12-06 16:28:00,1237,"Looks like I'm booked up next weekend. Would've loved to join, I guess next year. Good luck guys! Hope to see another biggun posted shortly after you get back!"
276570,jwl,2008-12-07 02:56:00,1056,let's hope the river clears up...supposed to be some pretty crappy winds the next couple days..the snow I can live with
276675,lew,2008-12-07 15:20:00,12767,"Incase we don't meet up at the ramp for whatever reason, what kind & colour of boat is everybody using on Saturday, just so we can find each other on the water ??  We'll be in a green & beige Lund"
276686,jwl,2008-12-07 16:02:00,1056, green & cream Legend..I will be there early to clean the ramp if needed.
276689,Fishmaster,2008-12-07 16:14:00,920,I think with this weather its going to need cleaning ...JWL please tell the wind to go away ...or you will have lots of water to clean up also lol...
276693,irishfield,2008-12-07 16:24:00,26272,Getting less and less likely for me to be there Lew. Hammered with another foot and a half of snow up here since Thur night. Howling and zero visibilty now as well... But if I do you know the boat Blue/Platinum Lund..
276710,jwl,2008-12-07 17:20:00,1056," I hear ya Steve, it' s already goofed up 2 trips in the boat I had planned on the lower,Friday and today, at leats I got a decent shore morning in there the other day.  I got tabs on the weather and stuff no probs....river is pretty dirty today, I can see it's brown from my driveway like 2 blocks away"
276726,lew,2008-12-07 18:02:00,12767,"I guess these wild winds today won't be helping the water clarity either Jack, but hopefully they'll die down some as the week goes on.  Wayne, we've got less than an inch of snow on the ground here in the Smoke, but that'll do me just fine for the remainder of the winter"
276728,irishfield,2008-12-07 18:07:00,26272,Yah I know Lew... I was getting REALLY use to it strolling the downtown Thur/ Friday / Saturday... only to come back to this crap.  I've just plowed the laneway for the third time today... so Leah can get out to a party and so Jen can get in from her trip to TO ... 63K winds keeps filling it in solid to the height of the snow banks (3 feet !)
276739,jwl,2008-12-07 18:33:00,1056," right now the winds are NW, if it stays that way, the river will clean up pretty good, I was just down there and surprizingly it isn't really much worse than it was a few days ago when it started to stain up..it's not totally chocolate milk put it that way..lol"
277122,wuchikubo,2008-12-08 18:48:00,1114,"Well, it looks like I won't be able to make it to this G2G either. Wishing all a safe and fun G2G, good luck to all those going and hope to meet you another time.  Stan"
277124,lew,2008-12-08 18:58:00,12767,That's too bad Stan but perhaps you can make it next year.  A few of the guys & girls have had to back out for various reasons but it looks like there'll still be about 12 of us left for the trip.
277145,corvette1,2008-12-08 19:49:00,1765,i will be in my red&gray lund pro-v
277188,Rizzo,2008-12-08 22:20:00,4754,"Geez all these guys in Lunds. I'll be there representing the ""princecrafters"" on the board. Mainly blue with red writing and silver hull. Nasty looking winds this week. Looks like I'll have to bonk one right on the head"
277296,jwl,2008-12-09 01:32:00,1056," don't worry man, I will join ya in the ""non-Lund"" gang   I got a Legend"
278131,Rizzo,2008-12-11 02:26:00,4754,"hey jwl, any update on water colour or what the winds have been like down there?"
278282,jwl,2008-12-11 15:41:00,1056,"  I will give a better report later on but...the winds have been ok, and water has been shaping up the last couple days...I will take a drive by the river when i get my daughter from school, and update  further"
278303,Squid,2008-12-11 17:16:00,1656,It's going to be a great day guys!!
278305,Rizzo,2008-12-11 17:19:00,4754, ...says the guy with the canopy and propane heater
271573,jwl,2008-11-25 01:19:00,1056," ok boat is full then....just bring an assortment of tackle and a heavy rod..I know Bruce has a heavy rod already so if need be, I can loan ya one no probs.    As for some quick tackle pointers...some med to deep divers...larger size plastics, swim baits, I have a few things we can try out, not sure what you may have for this kind of tackle..I am pretty sure I have a few good floro leaders and such too...there is an area I want to try for a bit conditions pending to jig for them with big baits...then we are trolling"
271805,corvette1,2008-11-25 20:15:00,1765,count me in with 2 in my boat i have 4 wheel drive as well
271806,jwl,2008-11-25 20:20:00,1056," that will come in handy because pending conditions, I may have to get someone to throw the boat in for me, only takes a couple minutes to take off the van and put on a truck to launch..I have a van for a tow vehicle right now..no probs getting it there, I live like 5 minutes or so from the ramp..so I will keep tabs on it, and clean it the night before ect no probs...but even when I use my boat all winter for steelie fishin the Lower,I have fishing buddies with 4X4's as a back up plan"
271807,lew,2008-11-25 20:22:00,12767,Good to hear your gonna be joining us Corvette
271828,corvette1,2008-11-25 21:04:00,1765,looking forward to meeting OFC ers just let me know jack
272087,lew,2008-11-26 12:41:00,12767,"I painted up a couple baits this week for the river in a somewhat rainbow pattern allthough they don't show too well in this picture. Tops are a silvery grey, sides are pink and the bellies are white and I'm hoping they'll be effective.  Top one is 13"" with the lip and runs deep and the other is a 10"" Jake  We'll see what happens  "
272091,corvette1,2008-11-26 13:06:00,1765,lew they look good to me hope the ski's think so too
272138,jwl,2008-11-26 15:04:00,1056,"great colours for this time of year on the river, I have a couple things to try out as well that are on the lines of rainbow pattern"
272324,walleyemen,2008-11-26 23:18:00,316,"JWl i have  a musky rod and some lures as well , If ya need anything or help with anything please feel free to p.m .i'm in st.kitts."
272328,jwl,2008-11-26 23:20:00,1056," cool..pending conditions, I may just need a bit of help cleaning the ramp in the morning...at worst possibly someone to put me in and out with thier truck"
273133,bucktail,2008-11-29 01:01:00,1857,Sorry guys I have to bow out....not that I want to. Since my dad died a few months ago my mother has decided to go to Calgary for xmas and now are Belleville xmas is the same weekend. Would have loved to do this....my appologise...    Darren
273344,corvette1,2008-11-29 18:52:00,1765,Went out November  28th to practice for the Musky G2G and this is what we ended up with...  This is from the Camera Phone...    Doug
273345,jwl,2008-11-29 18:54:00,1056, nice
273691,lew,2008-11-30 21:11:00,12767," Sorry you can't join us Darren, but there's always next year."
273837,Rizzo,2008-12-01 02:26:00,4754,"nice fat fish! I was out on Saturday but only stuck around for a few hours. Water visibility was only 1.5 to 2 feet and temp was 41.5 degrees. Looks like you guys didn't have great water clarity either though, good to see you caught a healthy looking fish. I've never had great confidence when the water is murky grey like that rather than green. As for my boat, it ran great after the troubles I had the week before. Apparently a seal had worked its way loose so the marina guys locked it in place. While they were in there, we changed the impeller too as a preventative thing. Even got some wiring issues looked after on the trailer. What I forgot to tell them is the fishfinder sends out really weak signals while the boat is running, guess there is some kind of electrical interference or something.  Either way, I should be good to go on the 13th!"
273929,jwl,2008-12-01 05:51:00,1056," as per electrical interference....silly question but do you have spark plugs in your motor that have resistors in them????..usually what ever number sparkplug, then somewhere in the end of the numbers will be an ""R""  they are a bit pricey..for example the ones in my Merc are 14 bucks a piece around X 3..so just over 40 bucks for a new set. The resistors help stop electrical interference and also help protect your electronics if they are on and you start the boat"
273947,lew,2008-12-01 12:34:00,12767,"Good to hear you got away with a cheap fix on the motor Roger, cause some of those outboard engine repair bills can be downright scary sometimes.  Thanks for the update on the water conditions too."
274068,Rizzo,2008-12-01 18:23:00,4754,"thanks jwl I'll check the plugs. As far as launching goes, I'm not sure whats going on down there. I launched like a chump down at Netherby, when I got up to the marina I saw the ramp was open!"
274091,jwl,2008-12-01 19:23:00,1056," I can check that out closer to the day, I know the marina has been letting the local BASS guys use the launch for the end of thier tourny series for the year....I live like 5-10 minutes form all the ramps this way so I can check them out no probs and clean them up if we have to for the 13th"
274546,tinbanger,2008-12-02 17:59:00,1028,"Planning on giving the skis a shot tomorrow . Been trying for two weeks to get there but the weather  wouldn't cooperate . Hopefully tomorrow should be ok , hope the winds don't blow up to bad.  Preseme there is no white stuff down there as well.  As far as ramps go ,planning to launch at Frenchmens creek ( as per Lew's directions)  room in the boat if anyone interested ( see Hookups)  tb"
274560,lew,2008-12-02 18:55:00,12767,"Dave, there's also a ramp near the end of Netherby, just where it meets the River Road. I've never used it so have no idea of the condition but Rizzo has been using it and can tell you how it is.  It's a couple miles closer than Frenchmens Creek though."
274563,tinbanger,2008-12-02 19:02:00,1028,"thanks Lew Will take a look , may just pick the the first ( best) looking ramp I come across. Plan to troll upstream , so if needed I can drift back to the ramp LOL.  At the very least I will provide an update as to river conditions !  TB"
274798,jwl,2008-12-03 02:28:00,1056," heads up and not to fill this whole thread up...check my relpy in ""Hook-ups"""
275440,jwl,2008-12-04 16:41:00,1056,"well I just took a run down the river...for right now...ramps are dry and clean, water levels are decent...water is stained though..hopefully clears up alot over the next week,will keep posted on conditions"
275460,lew,2008-12-04 17:26:00,12767,Maybe throw a tarp over the ramps to keep them clean Jack ??
271330,Rizzo,2008-11-24 14:10:00,4754,The marina will be looking at it tomorrow (so I'm told) so I'll post an update when I hear what the problem was
271556,walleyemen,2008-11-25 00:48:00,316,"Jwl i'm still in if the offer previous still stands, just bought some new boots to keep the toosties warm, let me know if there is anything you need me to bring or what ever, i can help ya out with clearing the launch as well. Wayne!"
