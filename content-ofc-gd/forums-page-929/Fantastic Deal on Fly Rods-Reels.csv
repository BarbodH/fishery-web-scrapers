Reminded me of a US angler that always came up to Temagami and fly fished for smallies. We fished several time together and he had an Albright reel that I really liked. I went onto the Albright site and wow  Year End Sale  The selection is getting thin but 70% off on reels, rods and their waders.  I gonna pick up 2 - 9/10 weight reels and run them for salmon in the riggers this year. Might even add a rod or 2.  I've seen the GP rods and reels and at this price it's a great deal.  I just wish they still had my size for the wading shoes @ $20  Thanks again for the link"
