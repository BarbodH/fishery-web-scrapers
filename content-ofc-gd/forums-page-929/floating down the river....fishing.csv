One of the requirements is few shallow running sections,  The hard shell pontoons do not stand up well to rocky bottoms.  I am very familiar with the rouge and it is good below hwy 2.  I have seen several sections of the grand river that run super thin/shallow but there has to be ong runs of it that are good.  What rivers within 1 hour of Oshawa will work? What is the best section of the Grand river for this?  TIA forrest"
