278881,forrest,2008-12-13 00:30:00,1032,"The item was bought, paid for and in the possession of the purchaser.  Does this really need to be fought by you?  They are trying to bully you.  DO NOT send a letter to the dealer stating you received the top!  By doing so you are stating that you received the item.  Leave it up to the dealer to take you to small claims court and prove you received the items, it will be one more hurdle for them to jump.  I know squat about liens, but, if they dealer does want to take you to court I think it is $100 and 6months time limit for them to do so.  go to court and offer to give them the boat back  and see what they do!  As said previously it looks like someone looked over the paper work and thinks that a calculation mistake was made on the total when, in fact the bill has a cosmetic error only.  This is done all  the time on deals.  The salesman makes the deal and puts prices even on the N/C items and subtracts them from the main purchase.  Do you really think the dealer is taking a loss on you?  No way, they still profited and are coming back to you for more profit becuase someone thinks they did not make enough!  A better way they could have handled it is guilt you into doing all your future purchases there, it is better than idle threats.  forrest"
278884,jace,2008-12-13 00:45:00,472,"   clerical and typographical errors will not be upheld in a court.  so i'm thinking this is not looking good iff the itemization of options appears exactly as you posted on the copy you both have, listing 1000 and 300.  then totalling 300.   you might lose becasue it looks like a clerical error.  If it was included, it would list it as an option costing $0 or waived and included on the billing to show it was part of the transaction.   It looks to me like you have nothing showing the 1000 item was to be included free of charge."

Chained to the kid, ice fishing and steelhead are not for me and boating is out for me until warm and calm weather hits lake O."

278854,Big Cliff,2008-12-12 23:01:00,6899,"First of all, send him a letter telling him you are disputing his claim and that he is not to contact you further unless it is to advise you of a court date. He will not be allowed to harass you any more with bills or phone calls! If he does, let me know! It is against the law!  If he wants to take you to court, let him but when he files a claim, you get to file a defence (and a counter claim if you wish and I would do it claiming lost wages to appear in court and any costs incured ie. filing etc.). It will cost him money to file the claim, he (and you will have to attend a settlement conference) at which time a judge will advise: him to drop the claim, you to pay him, or the two of you to try to work out a settlement. (You don't have to do any of the above).  Then it if goes to court, that will cost him more money and time, and then the court will set a date and you will both have to attend. You can ask for delays if you want (I'll fill you in if necessary) Now, what I would do is wait until he files the original claim with the court, then I would talk to a paralegal (less expensive than a lawyer) and file the defense and counter claim. Worst case senario the case goes to court, a judge agrees with his claim, you have to pay the claim, pre trial intrest, and some costs (typically small claim court is capped at $300.00 but it could be more, it's up to the judge).  What is likely to happen: He drops the claim. ( It was supposed to be a simple remedy but it has turned into a nightmare) If he doesn't, you end up in court, Small Claims Court is supposed to be all about fairness and fair in this case would seem to me to be ""were you promissed something for free and then later billed for it""? That would be my impression BUT would a judge see it the same way? Only the judge can answer that question and it is a crap shoot. I have seen lots of cases that should have been a slam dunk go the opposite way just because the judge didn't understand what was going on.  Short case advice: Fight it! Talk to me if you need help! Oh ya, I'm not a lawyer, or a paralegal, I don't charge anything, I've just been through the system a few times trying to collect money and to be honest, I wouldn't bother doing it again. It is a farce!"
278860,BillM,2008-12-12 23:12:00,17367," Um, don't you think the dealer checked the paper work over when he paid in full?  I am sure he also has a receipt that states the balance has been paid in full...  Because they made a mathematical mistake, he should pay for it?  Learn how to add properly and this wouldn't have happened.  I'd tell the dealer to go pound sand."
278862,Fisherman,2008-12-12 23:18:00,7201,"How about pound snow, we've got lots to spare up here."
278864,BillM,2008-12-12 23:24:00,17367,"Snow works   We don't have much in Barrie, lol."
278865,nel,2008-12-12 23:24:00,52,"Thanks for all the advice. I'll fight it, as Big Cliff suggests.  Sorry, but I'm not going to mention the marina's name.  I'm not out to screw them (even though they're doing that to me...).   I just want to fish."
278868,walleyemen,2008-12-12 23:30:00,316,"Nel was the cover with the boat when you picked it up or did you receive it afterwards, if you got it with the boat then in my unexpert opinion is it's payed in full, and even if it was picked up afterwards why wasn't payment asked for then, fight it!"
