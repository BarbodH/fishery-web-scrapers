278012,blaque,2008-12-10 21:42:00,2419,"There is actually a guy i saw on some program that tried to fly under a bridge before landing with another guy flying just over the bridge, the one guy, hit the bridge and died instantly. The one that lived, is in the process of trying to design a landing ramp and is going to try and land without a parachute and land on this ramp like a water slide and slide to a stop. THe guy said he was suicidal and tried to commit suicide a few times (not by flying).......until he found the sport of .....well, whatever this is called. And it made him feel alive, and worth living again, and if he died doing it, well........he wouldnt care because this is what prevented him from killing himself anyway."
278013,douG,2008-12-10 21:43:00,2693,"Alright already, I see the little knapsack on the back, and also saw someone at the beginning of the clip under a parasail.  I would still like to see the chute deploy part of the flight.  And another thing, I still really dislike those flyin monkeys."

278321,shane,2008-12-11 18:13:00,652,Pretty cool.   I wonder how far you could get if you jumped off the CN tower?   Could I get home?  Would sure beat driving.
