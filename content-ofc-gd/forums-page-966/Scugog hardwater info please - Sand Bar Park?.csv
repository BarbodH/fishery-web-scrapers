My boys are getting to the age now that I am thinking of bringing the ice hut out of mothball. So, I was wondering if anyone has a hut on Scugog during the winter and access the lake through the Ball Point area near Valentia? Or, is there any other access in that area such as Glassford Road?  Any info would be a great help.   Edit:  A quick drive out that way yesterday revealed a great access point at Sand Bar Park. Does anybody put a hut out from that location?  Once again thanks."

249821,big guy,2008-09-15 14:58:00,414,"Thanks for the info, that helps a lot. Obviously if people fish there, there are fish to be had."
249822,brifishrgy,2008-09-15 15:03:00,559,  OH I wish that was true
249829,Ramble,2008-09-15 15:21:00,713,"LOL I wish there was fish there as well LMAO. I think you have to go out farther. I know of people getting into the eyes out their at dark. The bite only lasts a short time from what i understand, i had a room mate who had a friend with a hut out their somewhere.  When my dad came up once and i was able get us onto a weedline. We found some perch and a few crappie. Its a descent place for kids cause you can laydown, look down the hole, and see bottom. So you can watch the perch come up to your bait.  There is a lot worse ways to spend a weekend then sitting out off the sand bar.  -R-"
