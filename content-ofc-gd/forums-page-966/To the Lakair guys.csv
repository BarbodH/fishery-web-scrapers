Don't know if that is far from you guys but if it isn't, maybe I will see a few of you out there.  Have a great weekend."
249774,Spiel,2008-09-15 13:17:00,9065,....I'll be fishing over that way from time to time. Are you in a rental or your own boat?
249794,Cudz,2008-09-15 13:51:00,2652,probably a rental. I don't have a vehicle to pull my boat at the moment.  My boat is a bit small as well. Is Lakair far from West Arm Lodge.
249796,Spiel,2008-09-15 14:02:00,9065,"....Not certain on the distance, exactly. I'd say 3, maybe 4 miles. Lakair would be on your left side just before you pass under the Hwy #64 bridge."
