249201,canadianboy,2008-09-13 20:13:00,83,Hey i dont know if any of you have seen this before but the toronto star runs an auction site that has some great deals on cars sports equipment etc. i think there is even a pontoon boat for sale. i just figured that there has to be someone getting a new car or something as this can save them at least 30% of sticker. I have been watching star auctions for a couple months. Im not trying to like advertise or anything because im getting paid i just think that this could help some members save some money.  starauctions.ca   Cheers
