(we don't target carp/suckers/cat fish or chanel cats)
249186,keram,2008-09-13 18:56:00,585,"You should not be confused Mike. You have asked for freshwater ""fish"" MH is talking about freshwater "" species"" At 67 freshwater ""species""...., well, I consider it very lousy performace"

Only two fish were real trophy fish (27"" Steelhead, and 27"" Walleye), besides that, It hasn't been as great a year as I would have hoped for, but Fall is a big fish time of year, so we'll see what happens.."
249208,bassjnkie,2008-09-13 20:33:00,1101," Wahoo and marlin, damn dude you win.    The fight must have been awsome."

249228,keram,2008-09-13 21:40:00,585," I can see clearly now that you are really, really, REALLY confused. You are  a member of this board for almost three months with  400 + posts and you still do not see the difference between fishing board and and forum for single teen moms ( BTW I'm confused   little bit here because I do not know whether you are talking about single teens or single moms). Do not be discouraged, 2-3 more years and you will see the difference, belive me you are on the right track Now, going back to 67 different species of freshwater fish you've cought. Is there any reason why you do not want to list them as everybody else?"

249266,MCTFisher9120,2008-09-14 00:08:00,3761,"ok, i asked for peoplle to list the different species of fish they have caught this year. I listed the different fish i have caught, and thats that. Not sure as to why we are still going on about this."
249272,Wild,2008-09-14 00:43:00,704,"Who's the wise guy here that caught the clam? Forget who it was but sure was a great pic!  oh myself I caught halibut at the fish store, does that count?"
