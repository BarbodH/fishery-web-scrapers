248760,pokerdemon4,2008-09-12 02:02:00,135,"Me,  Haggisbasher and peech on hit up my favourite Kawartha lake for two days of musky fishing this past week.   We had a great adventure. In all 8 fish were boated with about another 10 follows or missed strikes.  The first day was the best. Conditions were perfect. The biggest two measured in at 44 inches. Both Haggisbasher and peech on boated those critters.  I was so jealous. I joked afterwards that it was like a fly in.  Ill never forget this day.  Enjoy.        "
