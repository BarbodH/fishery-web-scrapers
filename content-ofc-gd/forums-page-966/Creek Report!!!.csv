249642,tdotfisherman,2008-09-15 00:12:00,317,Nice fish dude.. I'd say 13 pounds..
249171,MCTFisher9120,2008-09-13 17:32:00,3761,"I went down to my local creek this morning to try out a little  fishing. I went to a small deep pool and let the current take my slip bobber and worm down and across it. The only two hit's i had were fish, both of witch i caught. I caught my first ever trout and my first ever salmon. I didnt get a weight on it but was it ever heavy. I fought this fish for a good 30 minutes running up and down streem. Here are my two fish!      Mike"
249172,Radnine,2008-09-13 17:35:00,1538,I don't know squat about Salmon (other than it comes in a can) but that looks like a nice one. Congrats on both of your firsts!
249173,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-09-13 17:49:00,0,Nice salmon! The smile says it all. They are a rush to catch! I like the colors on the little guy too. thanks for sharing.
249175,tjsa,2008-09-13 18:04:00,1578,"The first pic looks like a rainbow smolt, but don't quote me on that, I usually don;t catch them that small   :lol:  The 2nd pic looks like a nice sized chinook, still silver sided at this time of year, great catch, probably in the range of 15 lbs. maybe a bit more.  Tough to tell from a picture. You look like you had quite a battle there, t-shirt and pants all dirtied up, ..................but the smile in the picture says it all, regardless.   :thumbsup_anim:"
249206,ScarSnake,2008-09-13 20:25:00,20,Did you use the first fish as bait for the second fish?
249220,Casey123,2008-09-13 21:19:00,461,Congrats on the first time catch!  By spring you will be a full blown steel head snob.  LOL
249226,ChrisK,2008-09-13 21:32:00,2772,"Nice salmon and wee trout.. Looks like you had yourself alot of fun catching them under a float. Now comes the expensive part.....Float rod and reel and all the hardware, waders with a nice vest and a good pair of shades so you can look just as cool as the guy with 2000 bucks worth of equipment  hangin off him  thats standing next to ya less the attitude of course. Just kidding guys, Its great to have good equipment but its also nice to be curtious even in the face of ignorance...Education Education.....  Anyhow,look forward to seeing your next report pictures after you go out for some steel...  Cheers !!"
249239,modny,2008-09-13 22:29:00,502,"wow thats awesome.  salmon fishing under a bridge with graffitti, who woldda thunk it"
249243,kemper,2008-09-13 22:36:00,2232,"Yep, thats how it starts.  Next thing you know you are building a custom float rod...and you already have three.   good fishin man!"
249301,Rich,2008-09-14 02:13:00,3927,"Good stuff man, congrats!"

249334,douG,2008-09-14 04:27:00,2693,"What a blast!  This is a fabulous fishery we have in southern Ontario, and it always pleases me when I see these impressive fish caught in our urban parks.  You might be able to sell that photo..."

249435,Leecher,2008-09-14 14:48:00,7832,WTG Mike Congratulation on your PB Thanks for sharing Leechman
249583,MCTFisher9120,2008-09-14 22:27:00,3761, no I didn't i let the little fish go. I guess i could of eh.
249610,lazybum,2008-09-14 23:02:00,142,Nice salmon.  But now the your name doesn't fit your image as a salmon fisherman.
249612,kemper,2008-09-14 23:12:00,2232,"I just recognised where you are there.  I spend many hours every week fishing that trib, mostly just south of where you are standing. There are lots of bows in right now in the 15-20"" range. Try pink worms in the 2-3 foot fast runs, you will find them.  Good luck man, see ya on the water!"
249617,tibbs,2008-09-14 23:22:00,650,Nice salmon!  I tried a trib today for salmon but i had no luck.  I thought i might as well try my new centerpin out.  I learned how to use it though.
249636,MCTFisher9120,2008-09-14 23:55:00,3761,"I added another picture of the fish, maybe some people would care to give me some guesses on the weight of the fish.  Thanks,  Mike"
249640,silvio,2008-09-15 00:10:00,433,I am going to say about 12 give or take. Very nice for your first keep at it.
