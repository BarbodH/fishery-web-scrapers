249118,forrest,2008-09-13 02:29:00,1032,Forget Bell. Forget Rogers.  If you dont get Teksavvy at $30 a month or Acanac for $19 a month after hearing about here I will start a petition to have you slapped with a trout!  forrest
248751,Clampet,2008-09-12 01:21:00,1947,"I am currently on Bell's sympatico DSL Basic lite, and paying about $35.00 including some $9.00 for bandwidth fees.  The speed ain't all that great. Any cost effective suggestions?"
248755,Ramble,2008-09-12 01:27:00,713,"Not sure if you are in their coverage area but you should check out KOS. Kingston Online Service. I was getting it in peterborough last year, and we use it at home as well (Belleville). Don't quote me but i think its $35.00 a month for regular DSL and $16 a month for Light.  -R-"
248756,Terry,2008-09-12 01:30:00,14456,here is a deal if it works in your area  http://www.acanac.ca/DSL.html   if you get it tell them Terry sent you      no it will not get you a better deal or service     and they have no idea who I am but it would drive them crazy why everyone is telling them Terry sent them
248762,Clampet,2008-09-12 02:02:00,1947," Dude, that's what I have now."
248763,Clampet,2008-09-12 02:03:00,1947,"Thanks, Terry, I will look into that tomorrow, they seem to have very competitive pricing."
248768,ccmtcanada,2008-09-12 02:18:00,7971, It's not what you have now...you said you were paying 35 for DSL light...he's getting DSL for the same price...much faster than light.  The light cost is half the price of what you are paying for now.
248800,Ramble,2008-09-12 04:39:00,713,"What ccmt said....I have had the ""pleasure"" of experianceing Bell's sympatico...it works almost as well as their help center. Lite is worse. I have NEVER had a problem with KOS.  -R-"
248820,Randy,2008-09-12 11:24:00,115,"I'm in Scarborough and I use My Cybernet who's office is in Markham, just north of me. For about $35/mo I get 2.5Mbps speed. I don't get the full 5 Mbps because I'm told that I'm in an older area with old telephone lines."
248833,Marko,2008-09-12 11:51:00,854,"Bell i just awful. Had it for few months and it was up and down. Internet would just stop working randomly couple of times a day. Switched to Rogers,as much as i hate them, but the internet service has been great for me."
248836,cplummer,2008-09-12 11:56:00,165,wow i'm on cogeco pro and paying 85 a month for these speeds...
248843,ricoboxing,2008-09-12 12:14:00,398,a wireless router and a neighbour with an unsecured connection is always the best!
248849,bigugli,2008-09-12 12:28:00,6138,"Something wrong there Cliff. I'm paying $120 for Phone, cable and highspeed with Cogeco. I got tired of calling India to speak with Bell 'Canada'    Cogeco has been reliable."
248850,bigugli,2008-09-12 12:31:00,6138,Had a neighbour like that. Spliced his cable to a 110 outlet to teach him a lesson.  It cost him a whole lot more in the end.
248856,cplummer,2008-09-12 13:01:00,165,"your on standard cogeco..  pro add another 30 a month.. for TV i get 1200 channels and not pay one cent a month.. all PPV ,sports events porn ect. Phone is free as well.."
248869,mikeymikey,2008-09-12 13:41:00,376,Don't bother with any other ISP.  Go with www.TEKSAVVY.com  If you visit DSLReports.com website you'll find out why it is the most popular 3rd party ISP.
248870,ricoboxing,2008-09-12 13:41:00,398,"i dont get it?  your neigbour was using your unsecured wireless network, so you spliced his cable?"
248873,danbo,2008-09-12 13:47:00,2646,Rogers Cable here..no probs.
248914,bigugli,2008-09-12 15:16:00,6138,"Whether you pirate a satellite signal, or from a cable line,  its still the same thing. Theft."
248940,cplummer,2008-09-12 16:32:00,165,na.. been proven in court .. whats in the air is all free.. unless the gov starts charging us to breath ..SHHH thats always a possiblity.......
248986,Terry,2008-09-12 19:25:00,14456,if you leave your network open to the world they have every right to use it
248994,Riparian,2008-09-12 19:58:00,269,"I think hes saying his neighbor spliced his cable tv cable line.  Im with Terry. if you are broadcasting an unsecured wireless signal, its your own fault. And im pretty sure its not illegal."
249035,Canuck2fan,2008-09-12 22:10:00,1444, Yep if you have DSL available in your area Acanac are the ones to go with for cheap. I bought my sister a year's worth for her birthday in June. She isn't very tech savy and has had NO COMPLAINTS. Now if I could just get my contract over with before the special stops I will switch myself LOL.
249045,Clampet,2008-09-12 22:50:00,1947," I apologize, I jumped the gun thar young feller (waddya expect, I'm Jed Clamp-it)."
249047,Clampet,2008-09-12 22:53:00,1947,"I got granny to contact the varmints, and she negotiated a plan fer the same thing, I think she got it fer $30.00/mth comes with 2GB bandwidth, and 4x faster than the DSL Basic Lite.  I'll use that fer now, but I can see from the responses that there are other solutions worth considerin'."
249049,Clampet,2008-09-12 22:57:00,1947,"I tried Rogers, but they were unable to route my e-mail thru MS Outlook. They said they could do Outlook Express (Instant Messenger), but I did not want that. I wanted Outlook, so I stuck with Bell as they were able to do so."
