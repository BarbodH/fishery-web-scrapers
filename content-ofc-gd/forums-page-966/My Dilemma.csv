248244,lew,2008-09-10 14:04:00,12767," Nuthin wrong with that TG, you can learn alot about life when your tired, bloody and dirty at the end of the day, infact it's something you can't learn from a book.  I think it's a lesson too many folks never learn  and it's a shame when they don't"
248248,Wild,2008-09-10 14:08:00,704,"Yes the guide experience can be either a good one or the worst experience of his life.  But one must consider this, if you had  a dream to own a lodge and used ground level guide experience to learn basic operations of a lodge this is fine, this experience be an asset in that field, yet it could be a roadblock and time wasted. No guarantees. On the other hand a diploma will provide many more options for the future and other pathways to success."
248252,anders,2008-09-10 14:15:00,1168,"Tell you what.  IF you got to school...let me know and i will give em a call!  If you set a goal for youself, go hunting!  As long as you make a true promise to yourself to continue your education in the NEAR future.  We only live once...school is always going to be there.  An oppourtunity like this might not.  Like someone else said....regrets???"
248271,bbog,2008-09-10 14:42:00,665,"Follow your own internal compass. If you don't your chances for success could be diminished.  If you really want to guide, then guide. If you know that you'll have trouble going back to school after being out and earning - then perhaps schooling should take precedence.  It comes down to knowing yourself - the answer is within you."
248276,JohnAB,2008-09-10 14:52:00,178,"I am with Lew and Joey on this one. Do the guiding thing then go to school. I worked and enjoyed life for a couple of years after high school before I went to university and wouldn't trade it for the world.  But be forewarned, guiding is not all that much fun if you get the wrong client. It can turn into a 24 hour per day babysitting adventure for you. I have guided on numerous hunts out here and some are the proverbial hunts from heck. Guys won't get out of the truck, too cold, too steep, too everything for them but then some are the most rewarding times you can imagine. Also be warned guides do not make a lot of money per say from the outfitter, they make their money in tips. Also be warned as the new kid on the block, you are going to get some of the more mundane jobs but as Lew said, nothing wrong with that."
248317,SlowPoke,2008-09-10 17:11:00,2984,"I have very few regrets in life but one of them is putting fun ahead of my future. My goal in life was working just hard enough to have a good weekend. I wasted several years looking forward to 'next weekend'.  I'm not saying school is the right decision for right now but if you are to put it off, make it meaningful.  Take Lew for example. Joining the Navy is not only an adventure but a life experience. Experience, credibility and discipline that can be applied to life after the Navy.  Ask yourself if guiding for a year or two can benefit you in your life and career path. Ask yourself if you have the discipline to get back on track after your adventure. -Brian"
248358,NAC,2008-09-10 20:18:00,369,"do both or do what you really want to do first.  Haliburton, SS Marie, many BC locations have colleges in the areas you would guide.  Make money guiding while getting your education. Could be a little more sketchy trying that out East.  wish I'd have thought of that when I was about to start my post secondary ed!"
248388,JohnF,2008-09-10 22:40:00,3494,"I've seen too many folks with nothing but schooling. They know nothing about the world and generally putzed up their first shot at life as an adult. I'm not knocking an education. It's a great asset, probably even a must these days, but in some ways it's overrated, or perhaps misrepresented.  My suggestion is to add 30 or 35 years to your current age and if the sum exceeds 65, go get an edykashun, right quick. If not, then see the world (or go guiding), have some fun, but be prepared to postpone taking on much responsibility (wife, family, mortgage, etc) until the edykashun is completed and a life career path established.  Speaking from experience it's a lot easier to settle down to schoolin', long term career responsibilities and a family if one gets the itch scratched first. Or another way of saying it - it's a whole lot easier to grow up when you're growed up already. Back in the day they called it sowing your wild oats. I have no idea what that really meant but it sounds kinda cool. If the itch is real bad, scratch the sucker. You'll appreciate school and all a whole lot more after the itch is fixed.  JF"

I would say as a father, your education is formost,but if I were you,I would take the job. There are many years ahead of you,to get your education. Did that make sense?  Hey John. We got these high educated fellas at our plant and thier pushing press buttons. They still have thier education,but thier doing grunt work. Lazy too.LOL"

Thanks again,  Hawk"

248667,Ramble,2008-09-11 21:07:00,713,What school?
248668,Jigger,2008-09-11 21:07:00,1237,"For what its worth, now that you've made your decision, make sure that you know what it is you want to do in the end. Meaning after school is done. It could be the most important(insert # of yrs here) years of your life as far as direction goes. At the same time, don't make it the biggest waste of time possible. In high school, there were alot of guys laughing at my buddies and I just because we'd do enough to get through class and look toward the time afterward to get messed up and do crazy...stuff. These guys went on to college and university while we worked and carried on. These same guys now spent X amount of time in school, but didn't know what they wanted to do. They now live with their parents under a mountain of debt, or have jobs in totally un-related fields. Direction is the key.  When I first read your thread, the first thing that came to my mind was a line from a Red Hot Chili Peppers song. ""It's better to regret something you did than something you didn't do.""  I don't hunt, but if the option was mine and it was a fishing lodge instead...No brainer."
248697,chickenhawk,2008-09-11 22:48:00,612,well the fishing lodge job i've got next summer anyways......   sorry you were using that as an example....my bad  Thanks again guys/ladies of the board  Hawk

248734,danbo,2008-09-12 00:26:00,2646,Yep..I wanna go back home! Lol..
249088,Rich,2008-09-13 00:32:00,3927,Be the guide for a couple of years and SAVE the money earned to go to school when you come back.. if you ever come back.
249152,JohnF,2008-09-13 14:06:00,3494, Sound like the all to common type who think the world owes them something just cuz they went to school. Ya gotta make yer own opportunities.  JF
249154,JohnF,2008-09-13 14:08:00,3494," But girls lead to parties, and parties are the obstacle to succeeding at school. Nothing like a wife at home to keep yer nose to the books.  That being said, yer right. The campus is definitely a happy and prolific hunting ground.  JF"
249155,solopaddler,2008-09-13 14:12:00,8605,  They're coming for you buddy!  
248235,fishinggeek,2008-09-10 13:41:00,325,"I say if you're young and the chances of you going to school afterwards is extremely high, then do what you want.  If you're not young or you might not go back to school after your guiding, then go to school.  Sure there are a lot of educated people with menial jobs, and there are a lot of ""uneducated"" people that are affluent, but on balance, education is an investment.  Of course there are exceptions, but without question that, on average, education leads to not only better income, but a higher quality of life as one has more options.  But I also agree with Lew, and that life's short, so have fun.  Just make sure you get yourself sorted out eventually, and not too late in life."
248237,fishinggeek,2008-09-10 13:49:00,325," And since when is education and fun mutually exclusive?  Didn't you go to UWO?  Chickenhawk, school also isn't just about the books.  Not only is it fun, but it can be really practical as well.  Think about this: a lot of your friends will be in the same school and program.  A lot will have similar career paths.  School can really open up doors after you graduate.  I know I have made some important connections at school that have helped me professionally, and I always try to reciprocate with past school friends who need help to.  Kind of like Nancur's post on his new house (congrats), and how many on OFC generously offered appliances.  You'll have a college network that might just come in handy when you're looking for that sweet job."
248238,LeXXington,2008-09-10 13:49:00,1928,"Very hard to go back too school after life catches up. Get an education, a great job and open your own lodge"
