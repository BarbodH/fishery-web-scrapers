248874,Reef Runner,2008-09-12 13:47:00,980,"Hello all,  Headed up to the Kawartha's this weekend for a little   .  Weather and wind permitting, was thinking about taking the trip over to Balsam for some fall Musky and Smallmouth action.    Anybody fish it recently?  Success? Failure? Baits I should be relying on?  I usually concentrate in on the South part of the lake which I have decent knowledge and success on.  Never really ventured North coming out of the west side waterway.  Would you recommend putting the gas toward puttin around new grounds or stick to the known?  If yes, what should I be looking for on the sonar?  Any advice is greatly appreciated and reciprocated with (hopefully) one kick-donkey report. Thank you in advance,  reefrunner"
248881,addy79,2008-09-12 14:10:00,573,North end looks promising on Anglers Atlas maps...  some experienced input would boost are confidence though.
248886,pokerdemon4,2008-09-12 14:19:00,135,"I would throw a large M&G all day.  Watch your lure every reterive. Also, don't forget to figure 8.  Haggisbasher nailed a monster at boatside with a figure eight.  So exciting.  They hit when you least expect it.  Make as many casts as you can and you will be rewarded."

248900,Reef Runner,2008-09-12 14:43:00,980,"Thanks JohnnyB, know you did well out on Balsam, I'm gonna be looking hard for these edges.  Pokerdemon4, seeing as you are a musky catching machine, I greatly appreciate your input.  Addy79, I checked and the locks shut'er down at 5:30pm, its gonna be a short day...lol."
248907,addy79,2008-09-12 14:59:00,573,"  boooo that blows, they should make the locks self serve! yeah right... what time does it open?"

249052,canadianboy,2008-09-12 23:05:00,83,i was having great luck on a berkly frenzy deep diving lure around ten feet in about 20-25 fow around indian point north bay granted nothing big but alot of numbers
249076,Rich,2008-09-13 00:15:00,3927,"It's hard not to do well on Balsam. Big spinnerbaits, deep weedlines! Cast or troll, trolling seems more productive for me personally."
249107,Bly,2008-09-13 01:31:00,1556,Only been on Balsam once but my luck this season has been with spinnerbaits and of course weeds.  Best of luck!  Look forward to the report and pictures
