248766,Clampet,2008-09-12 02:07:00,1947,"Yes, indeed. I thought of them today at 8:45 A.M. I thought it peculiar that no one else in the office seemed to remember."
248771,Pigeontroller,2008-09-12 02:24:00,2793,"I still get choked up when I think of the bravery of the passengers of A.A. Flight 93...  Reminds me of a quote I heard years ago on a tv show, ""The greatest gift one can give to another is their life"""
248775,oxcowboy,2008-09-12 02:28:00,544,lets not go there simcoe fisherman.  this is a great post lets not bring politics into it so it gets locked.   jason
248776,Mattones,2008-09-12 02:31:00,587,"7 years ago, wow it seems only like 4."
248781,Pigeontroller,2008-09-12 02:39:00,2793," yes, lets keep this one on the level, but don't forget many people have died since 9/11...No need to asign blame, just teach your kids the value of human life, and how aweful war and needless killing is! And never forget how lucky we are here in Canada!!!"
248782,jediangler,2008-09-12 02:45:00,1923,Also don't forget those who died trying to make a difference since 9/11.  http://icasualties.org/oif/  We are very lucky here in Canada.
248791,love2fishhave2work,2008-09-12 03:19:00,212,"Horrible day no one should ever forget.  I was in NYC, midtown and was supposed to be in the towers later that day.  The sight, sound and feel of the city, the people and the panic that day will remain in my mind forever."
248793,holdfast,2008-09-12 03:24:00,1813,"Yup Sep 11 changed my life for two reasons 9/11 and the year before my Mom passed away Sep 11  I remember I was in Petawawa on Top of a Truck getting a Cam net ready for an Exercise and looking down at a Soldier that was excited saying the World trade centres were under attack.  The Next Day the Commanding Officer had the whole Unit on Parade and told us that the Canadian Military was on Red Alert and he was awaiting Orders from the Brigade Commander who Happened to be General Hilliar.  Incidentally, In 1981 we were doing on the job training in Wainwright AB before we would be shipped out to Chilliwack for our Engineer Course right after recruiting when a fellow mate told us an Interesting fact.  He happened to be doing his Basic Infantry course with the PPCLI Battle School in Wainwright and relayed what he was taught that Day.  He said that his Instructor told them that the greatest threat to Canada and the Canadian Military would be Terrorism.  Who would think that, when, we were still in the Middle of the Cold War.  It freaked all us kids and freaks me out to this day."
249086,lunkerbasshunter,2008-09-13 00:29:00,2585,i will never forget that day as long as i live.  I will remember where i was and what i was doing  All the best to those that have lost a family member or friend 7 years ago.
248479,Roy,2008-09-11 09:46:00,13728,My thoughts turn to the families who suffered horrific losses 7 years ago on what is now referred to as 9/11.  Give your children an extra hug today.
248481,Fishn Technishn,2008-09-11 10:12:00,198,"I second that motion whole heartedly. Oddly enough, I was in the middle of Stoney Lake (fishing) when my wife called on a cell phone and told me the news. It still gives me goosebumps to think about it! My heart goes out to all who have fought any kind of battle against this kind of terror and lost a loved one. FT"
248488,ccmtcanada,2008-09-11 11:18:00,7971,A day where everyone knows exactly where they were and what they were doing when they heard the news.  Hard to believe it was 7 years ago already though.  Thanks for the thread Roy....they will never be forgotten.
248490,JFR,2008-09-11 11:26:00,498,My thoughts today are for the families of those who lost their lives.  John
248491,danbo,2008-09-11 11:31:00,2646,2740  people died that day.. God rest their souls.
248493,blaque,2008-09-11 11:34:00,2419,"Yup, ill never forget, the guy in the office next to me, had his headphones on, and non shalantly said, hmmmm.....there sayin a plane ran into the world trade center, i thought .......little private prop plane stuck at the top or something, he didnt know anything past the fact that it was a plane, and it hit the building according to the radio. Business as usual around the office.....and before you knew it........the story progressed and just got worse, and finally...... our entire office was huddled in the cafeteria watching this horror on the T.V. Ive never had a feeling anything like it just staring at a T.V. screen. Manhattan never seemed so close to Western N.Y. than that day."
248502,John,2008-09-11 12:35:00,2956,"Thank you Roy...  I was in the UK ready to fly back to Canada. Heathrow airport was a nightmare. We gladly gave up our seats so that returning Americans could get home to their loved ones through Toronto. Four days later we were back home...  It is hard to believe Cliff, that 7 years has gone by...."
248504,ecmilley,2008-09-11 12:38:00,2163,"never forget that day, was stuck in traffic in my old ford taurus listning to howard stern when the first reports came in"
248506,kemper,2008-09-11 12:40:00,2232,"I was 11, sitting in a grade 5 classroom when the planes hit the towers. Strange, I cannot remember anything I learned that year, I actually had to think hard to remember my  teacher's name but I can remember that day like it was yesterday. Nobody will ever forget September 11, 2001."
248512,Chrispy,2008-09-11 12:46:00,168,"I was in my office when my wife called me.....her Brother worked in one of the towers for a consulting company....I ran over next door to the little store that had a TV to see what happened for myself.....about 5 minutes into watching it the second plane hit....my heart dropped!!!!!!  I got on my cell and called my wife back and she told me that her brother had called their Mom and that he was on business in Seattle and that he was safe....I was happy to hear that he was OK, but I was mad as hell about what happened and all those innocent people that were lost.....I will never forget!!   Chrispy!"
248513,ccmtcanada,2008-09-11 12:49:00,7971,"I was in a meeting with my VP of Advertising when someone knocked on his door.  Another VP came in and said ""turn on the TV"".  My boss said ""Which station?"".   He replied ""Any station""."
248515,Reef Runner,2008-09-11 12:54:00,980,"Thanks for the post Roy. My condolonces go out to every family that had suffered as a result.  I was just beginning at the University of Toronto when it happened and heard about it from the Prof in lecture hall.  7 years, wow."
248516,jediangler,2008-09-11 12:57:00,1923,"I was on the graveyard shift the night before, so I slept through the entire day. Didn't hear about what had happened till 5pm."
248517,Greencoachdog,2008-09-11 12:58:00,8163,My deepest sympathies go out to the good folks that lost family and friends in such a cowardly attack by a group that doesn't even deserve to be called humans.
248527,anders,2008-09-11 13:24:00,1168,I was in my second year of university at Lake Superior State in Sault Michigan.  Large anouncement came across the intercom telling everybody that classes were cancelled till further notice.  I went to the library (about the only time i ever did) and there were TVs set up and people crying everywhere.  WHen i realized what had happened i knew that i had to get back across the border.  The border bus was shut down and had to hitch a ride with someone i didnt know.  Talk about a hectic border!  Never forget that day.
248531,Joey,2008-09-11 13:31:00,9122,Thanks for the reminder Roy.  I will never forget the horror  Joey
248537,BillM,2008-09-11 13:51:00,17367,"Definitely one of the darkest days that anyone can remember...  I was woken up by my dad, and stuck to the TV for atleast 4 days.  I also signed up online on Red Crosses website in order to volunteer, but they wouldn't let me across the border when I got to Buffalo..  RIP to all those innocent people."
248543,bow slayer,2008-09-11 14:00:00,1074,"well it was shortly after 9am on a very similar type morning as today bright and sunny when walking through the  Canadian Tire store here in St.Thomas with my 2 year old son I noticed a few people huddled around a small TV that was on display watching  first tower burning. My first thought was just a plane off course merely an accident,then wham along came the second, I thought no way was this an accident.Rushed  home and spent the rest of the day glued to the TV. R I P  to the inocent lives lost that day."
248544,ChrisK,2008-09-11 14:01:00,2772,Was a horrific day. Our prayers go out to those who lost their lives on 9/11 with hopes that some day there will be peace....
248549,fishnsled,2008-09-11 14:16:00,3520,A day that will live with us forever and will never be forgotten.  My condolences to the families and friends who lost their loved ones that day.
248554,bucktail,2008-09-11 14:30:00,1857,My best freinds wife is the night editor for the Wall Street Journal. She had left 20 minutes earlier and got home not knowing what happened. Her office over looks ground zero and was completely destroyed by the collapse of north tower. She lost alot of friends that day. I am just glad that she didn't work late that day.
248573,packrat,2008-09-11 15:35:00,93,Very sad day in American history----my condolences to all who lost loved ones.  The image of the second plane hitting the building and just disappearing is one I'll never forget.
248598,dustink,2008-09-11 17:24:00,526," ""Any station.""  That says is it all.  I was listening to coverage on the Radio and just walked into the Dentist (4 wisdom teeth pulled) when the first Tower fell.  May God give those families some peace today......Let's Roll!  dk"
248757,oxcowboy,2008-09-12 01:47:00,544,"by far the darkest day in american history, although the attack on pearl harbor was terrible, the instant news coverage and the fact that these poor people were civillians makes this the most disgusting act ever.  i was teaching a class of 8th graders when we first heard the news, our entire school was so quiet with everyone glued to the tv.  classes didnt change, we all just sat there stunned.  i am currently watching a show on the history channel that is titled 102 minutes that changed america.  it is all raw video from that morning.  may God please look after the families of all the victims and may their souls rest in peace.  jason"
248759,issamhay,2008-09-12 01:55:00,77,rip to the victims and also the thousands (if not millions) of innocent iraqis killed as a result of Bush's war.
