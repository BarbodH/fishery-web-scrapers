249549,PatrickGG,2008-09-14 21:04:00,562,Crayfish is a essential food source for certain fish species as for cormorants and gobies are rendered useless.
249553,hammercarp,2008-09-14 21:09:00,964,What they can be trained to do here is catch fish that you have released. I have watched this happen. A guy was catching pan fish and I could see a commorant waiting for him to throw one back. It would time it's dives. The bird would dive as soon as he had the fish in hand. When he dropped it in the water the bird was waiting for the exhausted and disoriented fish . The commorant kept this up until full. I have seen this behavior more than once in different locations. Kinda defeats C&R.
