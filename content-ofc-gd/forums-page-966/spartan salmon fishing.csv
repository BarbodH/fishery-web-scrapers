Have a boat but am not rigged for Lake o salmon:  Never been and do not have any deep water equipment (downriggers etc).  No planar boards. I do have cleos and some hard baits that will swim at 20ft.  I am heading out at 6am for a few hours around darlington. Any tips on making the most of what I have?  forrest"

Everyone else was using down riggers but only one guy faired better.  In all I think it was pretty good, could have landed a couple more and maybe hooked a bit more with some trolling knowledge.   forrest"
