249739,Whopper,2008-09-15 10:40:00,2174,"Yep southwest Ohio got hit pretty hard, spent the whole afternoon yesterday removing a tree from a car. Hard to believe we got winds up to 60MHP from something that hit land over 1200miles away.  Looks like a war zone here"
249741,OhioFisherman,2008-09-15 10:48:00,6623,"Morning Phil, ya saw the news reports from farther south of here not good. Still like 370,000 with out power in this area. Peg`s mom called yesterday evening, lives 1/4 mile from Lake Erie and said the police called and told them not to leave the house, downed power lines and trees blocking the roads.  My yard has tree limbs all over it, lost one of my bigger maple trees, glad I put them far from the house, just waiting for daylight to check things out."
249754,Whopper,2008-09-15 12:14:00,2174,"Good morning to you too Paul!  Here's a few pics of what I did yesterday afternoon, uncovering one of my kid's roommate's car from infront of their house.        I was disappointed on Friday when we cancelled a trip to the big pond but now I'm kind of glad we weren't on the lake yesterday"
