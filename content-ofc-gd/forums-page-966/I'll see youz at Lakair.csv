I'll be heading up to the trailer this morning to get the boat ready and get a few chores done, then I'll spend the night there and head off to the camp very early tomorrow morning.  Weather looks like it's gonna be excellent for us up there all week long.  Drive careful boyz and I'll see everyone up there when you arrive.  I'll be back home around the 23rd ............maybe"
249734,Roy,2008-09-15 08:56:00,13728,"See you on Friday Lew. Come to think of it, I'll probably be a little late arriving so we'll have a better chance at a 4AM chinwag around a fire and a cuppa.  You drive safely too."
