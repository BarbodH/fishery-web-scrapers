I was just in touch with Kevin at lakeair and he said they were out of fire wood at this time.. so we need a group effort for fire wood. if you could bring some up with you then we could have the g2g fire . im sure everyone would like a little warm place to shoot the breeze around. thanks in advance.   Dann 
248202,lew,2008-09-10 09:30:00,12767,I always bring firewood to Lakair but use it for the early mornings.  No better way to start the day than a 4 A.M. bonfire with a pot of coffee brewing on the Coleman and listening to the birds & critters waking up.  See youz all up there next week.
248283,Roy,2008-09-10 15:03:00,13728,"Yeah, I'll bring a little too. Kevin, are you running out of trees?  Some of the picnic tables are due for replacement anyhow. And I'll bet that the deck on cabin #11 would last a long weekend."

Sept sounds great, but keep in mind the further you get into the month the earlier it gets dark and the colder it gets.  ( been there done that )  I'm scheduled for an angiogram July 17th and if no surgery is required I will try my best to be there."
222137,highdrifter,2008-07-02 14:44:00,2534," Interesting Glen..  I just booked the week of the 15th off!  I wonder how the fishing is though?!  I'm told it's prime time for lunges, but what about eyes?  Still, I'd be down for that!!  HD"
222143,Roy,2008-07-02 15:19:00,13728,"Hell, yeah! I gotta fish with Fidel at least ONCE in my life!"
222152,highdrifter,2008-07-02 15:51:00,2534, Oh stop it you...
222162,Stoty,2008-07-02 16:35:00,2910,"As long as the bank account will allow, I am interested!"
222164,ccmtcanada,2008-07-02 16:41:00,7971,"As much as we'd love to, September is a tough month for us babysitting wise!!  We'll keep it in mind just in case though..."
222174,Nanook,2008-07-02 17:14:00,565," Cant make for the 2nd week. We will be off somewhere celebrating our 50th anniversary,and may be a bit short of Moolah. But then.... Ive got my 'MAD MONEY' to fall back on  Just have to see how things work out.  Great idea Glen !!!"

222185,wuchikubo,2008-07-02 18:02:00,1114,"I'm interested too but I don't think it will happen for me this year, unless I'm looking for a divorce  Not a good fishing year for me   ."

222189,JohnF,2008-07-02 18:13:00,3494,"Well, the Friday is exam day for my students so likely the best I could expect would be to hit the road at about midnight to get there for the dawn run Saturday. Dunno if it's worth my while or not if everyone's heading out early Sunday. Mebbe I should just mark next June in the calendar and plan accordingly.  JF"
222192,Greencoachdog,2008-07-02 18:18:00,8163,...
222194,JohnF,2008-07-02 18:24:00,3494," Jeez. I'd sure hate to miss seeing you puking. I'm gonna talk to my fishing buddy, see if he's up for it. We'll do the tent thing and rent a boat and mebbe stick around for a few extra days if he's interested.  JF"

221782,Sinker,2008-07-01 16:17:00,8692,"Perfect time if you ask me Glen. Great fishing, and hunting season isn't quite open yet  Sinker"
221809,misfish,2008-07-01 17:18:00,29133,"Why not try something dif? Like maybe, something down yer way Glenn."
221812,lew,2008-07-01 17:28:00,12767,"I'm back up at Lakair from August 14th - 20th Glen, but another trip in September sounds like an excellent idea.  I was there in September '06 and we practically had the lake to ourselves....perfect"
221815,pokerdemon4,2008-07-01 17:33:00,135,Ive never been to a OFC g2g.  If there is another this year I would go.   If it falls on a weekend that I work I guess Ill be callin in.  Fishing emergency. HeHe.

221819,lew,2008-07-01 17:47:00,12767," As a matter of fact I did Glen, and I figure she's about 5 pounds heavier now.  I've still got her address, so maybe I'll go see if she wants to come out and play again if  we go up this September  "

221834,JohnF,2008-07-01 18:54:00,3494,"I'd be interested, depending on which week it happens. I'm booked to teach a course for a two week period in there somewhere but if I can work around that I'm in.  One other thing, I've got no ride - boat ride that is.  JF"
221852,John,2008-07-01 19:32:00,2956, 13th 14th 15th or somewhere around there would work great. I'm sure that Kevin and Leslie would have some cottages and I doubt that anyone would be in the campsites.

221863,Spiel,2008-07-01 20:06:00,9065,"....Every month you say Glen, wonder who thunk that up?  I'm sure I could swing it with work no matter the weekend and either way it'd be my B'day present to me.  Crikey I may do August as well, nice to have senior picks for holidays!"
221880,kickingfrog,2008-07-01 20:49:00,8333,"I go out for a quick paddle on Canada Day   and this happens???  It's only been 5 hours and I feel like I almost missed out.  September in Canada, I make sure my auger is sharp.  I think Dawg really does like us.   "
221888,nancur373,2008-07-01 21:52:00,1211,I'm in if someone got room in their boat. If I don't have one by then.

221900,Joey,2008-07-01 22:36:00,9122,"Could be possible.  We usually go twice a year, and Sept. is generally our second trip.  Let us know what Kevin says G.  Joey"
