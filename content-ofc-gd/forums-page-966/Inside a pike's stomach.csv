249066,Cudz,2008-09-12 23:59:00,2652,A friend of mine caught a 9 pound pike in Geargian Bay 2 days ago.  He took it home and cut it up.  He opened the stomach to see what it had been eating and to his surprise he found 2 freshly eaten crayfish.  I was a bit surprised as well seeing as pike don't see down very well.  I should know better.  Pike will eat almost anything that moves.
249073,Rich,2008-09-13 00:10:00,3927,"Pike are great scavengers, in fact they say the best bait for big pike is cut or dead bait on or near bottom through the ice. I don't see why it wouldn't work in the summer."
249074,TennesseeGuy,2008-09-13 00:15:00,957,The camera of my underwater viewing system was sitting on the bottom when picked up by a pike.
249075,PatrickGG,2008-09-13 00:15:00,562,"If they hit Tube Jigs and Jig and Pigs i don't see why they wouldn't Eat Crayfish, i think they will eat anything that fits down there throat."
249080,jwl,2008-09-13 00:23:00,1056,"in late fall when it's really cold out and early spring just after ice out, I mostly fish big white twisters for them , gotta fish really slow and keep in contact with the bottom to get them most of the time. This will catch fish often when no-one else is getting them"
249081,Clampet,2008-09-13 00:25:00,1947, Better than live minnows.
249091,GbayGiant,2008-09-13 00:33:00,1780,"All my biggest pike came on jigs, walleye fishing rite on the bottom, spring and fall."
249096,CLofchik,2008-09-13 00:39:00,854,They got puked up by the 3lb. smallmouth he ate last week.
249100,tdotfisherman,2008-09-13 00:54:00,317,"I've caught Pike on flipping jigs w/ trailers up in northern lakes before.. They will eat anything they can, including crayfish.. aggressive little buggers, they are.."
249101,oxcowboy,2008-09-13 00:55:00,544,"up north, i would say most of the ones we catch have crawdads in them,  way more than minnows.  my biggest was caught on a madman crawdad and jig.  jason"
249113,Cudz,2008-09-13 01:45:00,2652,lol
249162,limeyangler,2008-09-13 15:16:00,5204,   LOL...good one!
249164,jwl,2008-09-13 15:33:00,1056,"when I took my 52 incher musky to the taxidermist a few years back,it had a hard lump in it's belly,out of curiosity,while I was still at the shop he cut it open so we could see what it was, turned out to be a 15 1/2 inch catfish"
249302,Rich,2008-09-14 02:17:00,3927,"Even more interesting jwl, I remember reading an article in OOD quite a few years back about the Ottawa River catfish having walleye as their main diet. Talk about a food chain."
249310,Rizzo,2008-09-14 02:46:00,4754,"uh oh, the secret is out. Although I haven't checked personally, a relative kept a few pike from our cottage lake and they told me the same thing...crayfish in the stomach and nothing else."
