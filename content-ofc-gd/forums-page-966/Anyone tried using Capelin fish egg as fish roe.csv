It does not seem to smell as strong as Salmon egg, but again I don't know what it smelled like if it is submerge under water and at normal tempearature. The price is less than buying a handful of pre tied eggs. One can tie  a lot of roe for $5 worth of Capelin eggs."

249085,Rich,2008-09-13 00:29:00,3927,"More of a rib eye really, brown roe's the tenderloin."
