249036,tibbs,2008-09-12 22:12:00,650,Looks like your ready to me!  Have a fantastic trip!  Can't wait to see the report!
249041,Wild,2008-09-12 22:38:00,704,What no plugs? Ya have to pack a few Rapalas cause you never know...
249042,Moosebunk,2008-09-12 22:39:00,3970,Good luck Mike.  This should be a real interesting report when you return.
249063,Cudz,2008-09-12 23:41:00,2652,My dad came back from Alaska earlier in the summer and he had a blast casting pixie sppons (pink insert) for non-stop salmon action.  Have a great time and take lots of pics for us.
249111,Bly,2008-09-13 01:34:00,1556,Have fun and be safe!  Look forward to reading about your adventures when you return
249112,Rich,2008-09-13 01:40:00,3927," Dang that's a smart idea. Actually I feel like an idiot. When we went to Nova Scotia we bought cheapo CT rods while we were there because it was so expensive to take them on the plane. I really, really wish I thought of that.. fishin' with a 5 dollar rod just isn't cool!!!"
249125,jace,2008-09-13 03:40:00,472,"Guess where i`ve been for the last 5 weeks?      Like your friend, i come up here every year also.  A lot of the fisheries/runs are weak across the state this year but it's a blast.   A lot of the king and red fisheries were shut down up the coast to allow for sufficient escapement.  I caught silvers using a lot of colors and methods, but this year they really hammered the chartreuse super vibrax I see in the lower portion of your spinner box.   It's so hard to break away from what you see everybody else using though (hot pinks and oranges).  I just went through girdwood and anchorage in the turnagain arm where i hit some of the streams and rivers.   I'll be heading back home in 10 days, it would have been cool to try to arrange a meeting but i don't plan to head back down to Cook inlet, where you'll be.  What other spots do you plan to visit down there?   kasilof?  anchor?  Bring tons of rain gear, there's been so much rain this year that there have probably only been about 3 days i didn't come home wet.  I had to pick up extra rainwear and boots because nothing dries on its own overnight..the air is just so wet."
249143,solopaddler,2008-09-13 10:57:00,8605," Hey man that's really cool, check your pm's!"
249169,camillj,2008-09-13 17:26:00,1988,Wow... sounds like another epic journey Solo ! Can't wait for the reports - have a GREAT trip !  Now ... as for the gear ... I'd say maybe a couple cleo's ... and ... are you SURE you have enough floats ?
248885,solopaddler,2008-09-12 14:19:00,8605,"Just sittin' here at home sorting through all my terminal gear for a most epic trip leaving Thursday Sept 18th. Lot's of egg imitations, those 5 small boxes are all beads in various hues...  I'm sooo ready to go!  "
248887,Nemo,2008-09-12 14:22:00,727,Umm I think you need a rod...
248892,solopaddler,2008-09-12 14:29:00,8605, I mailed them ahead a couple weeks back. A lot cheaper and safer than putting them on the plane  .
248894,Reef Runner,2008-09-12 14:36:00,980,Good idea on mailing the rod ahead.  Looks like you got enough gear to make any flyfisher drool.  Where you headed and targetting?  Best of luck ou there!
248898,danbo,2008-09-12 14:42:00,2646,Don't forget the gaitors for your waders!
248899,solopaddler,2008-09-12 14:43:00,8605," Alaska. Rainbows, Dolly Varden, Coho and Steelhead."
248905,Nemo,2008-09-12 14:50:00,727,Can't wait for the report take lot's of pics.
248906,Nemo,2008-09-12 14:53:00,727,Oh and what about Marshmallows?
248912,Reef Runner,2008-09-12 15:14:00,980,"OMG.  That is sure to be an awsome trip, trip of a lifetime for most.  Wow.  Enjoy and lookin' forward on how you make out!"
248913,gdelongchamp,2008-09-12 15:14:00,199,"Heh solopaddler, my wife was in Alaska in the spring and brought back a beautiful book entitled ALaska Fishing. It's 450 pages of facts and fish, maps of all the rivers, pictures, lodges etc. and what rivers are prime fishing for the various species of fish up there. Details on 300 best fihing locations. The best lures recommended by the guides etc. for the individual fish. It was written by Alaska's top guides. Check www.publishers design.com isbn #192917011-4 Good luck and bring some warm clothing. I envy you and I am sure a lot of others will as well."
248915,tonyb,2008-09-12 15:20:00,1637,  &    
248916,jwl,2008-09-12 15:24:00,1056,"wow sounds like a trip of a lifetime,did you get any tips on colours up there for roe , and the imitations???, asking because I noticed all you choices are based on say, reds,pinks,oranges....no greens or chartruesses/yellows in the mix.  Can't wait to see the report after that trip,many would love to do that for sure"
248922,kemper,2008-09-12 15:34:00,2232,"Oh man solo im so pumped you invited me to come on this epic trip with you.....  Seriously, how much would it cost me..... like 3/4 coffees and we split gas?  All kidding aside you are doing another one of my top trips. Actually I think you have done them all...  Looks like an amazing report in the works! Oh and I think you need more Maxima leader material because you only seem to have 500 yards of it, wicked stuff isnt it?"
248926,FinS,2008-09-12 15:52:00,463,Mike looks like u got it all down pat  u heading to the mighty kenai?  have fun and watch out for them big bears
248936,bassjnkie,2008-09-12 16:22:00,1101,"Nice trip, take lots od pictures. Good luck.  By the way where did you get the circled boxes with the beads. "
248942,Paulus,2008-09-12 16:36:00,522,"LOL! you are loaded up!  Take a picture of what's left after the trip, too. Let's see what got used up!  Hopefully those sweeeeet centrepins are still there.  I also can't wait for the pics!!!  p.-"
248944,Ramble,2008-09-12 16:39:00,713,Ooooohhhhhhhh you are gonna have some fun. The scenery is going to be KILLER.  You report better by pic heavy lol.  ...what about your fillet knife and a couple lemons? lol  -R-
248945,TJQ,2008-09-12 16:48:00,7806,Good luck!!!
248948,solopaddler,2008-09-12 17:03:00,8605," Mainly floatfishing and flyfishing, but yeah I've got a box of spinners and pixie spoons just for fooling around. Only single hooks allowed in AK though...pain in the butt to switch everything over to siwash.    Nope, not too many greens/chart for sure. I'm fishing with a friend who's been doing this trip for a bunch of years, he pretty much told me what to use..    Believe it or not it's not going to be that expensive, we're doing the whole trip on our own... (and yeah, Maxima rocks  )    Thanks Rene, and good guess, we'll be fishing the upper Kenai and a couple other lesser known rivers further down the peninsula for steelhead and coho.    Right here bud: http://troutbeads.com/Products.html    Oh it will be pic heavy. My fillet knife was actually in the pic I posted. I'll grab the lemons when I get there"
248950,danbo,2008-09-12 17:06:00,2646,Don't forget the bear bells..
248953,ccmtcanada,2008-09-12 17:13:00,7971,Oh man...you were telling me about this trip.  You'll have a blast....and I cant wait for the report Mike!!!  Good luck and be safe....
248956,wuchikubo,2008-09-12 17:33:00,1114,"Mike,  Taking any hitchhiking OFNers? Shall I have the sign made out Kenai river, Alaska? And where's my best bet to be seen on your route?  Okay, where's the extra batteries for the camera and don't for get the memory cards!  Serious, sounds like another great trip in the works for sure. (Very Envious)  Look forward to the fish porn when you get back.  Stan"
248977,NAC,2008-09-12 18:23:00,369,"very cool Solo.  interesting on the beads too, I'd like to know how they work out for you. Best of luck!  sounds like an epic trip!"
