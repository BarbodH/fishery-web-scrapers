248935,Ramble,2008-09-12 16:21:00,713,"Yup floating in the Kesagami...we took a boat out to see how big the pike was and we got a double header of a sort lol. I've hade northerns hit 'eyes over the 18"" mark bringing them into the boat. This year actually a guest landed a 48 inch northern on a 18"" walleye lol.  -R-"
248962,Reef Runner,2008-09-12 17:51:00,980,"Ramble, I've seen that before.  In fact.....I got a pic.  "
248991,Ramble,2008-09-12 19:56:00,713,awesome photo.  -R-
249082,lunkerbasshunter,2008-09-13 00:25:00,2585,"Thats what the fish around the power plants look like, it ust swam up the trent from lake o lol  Cheers!"
249303,Rich,2008-09-14 02:20:00,3927,All my bluegills look like that!  I gotta stop fishing at the pet store.
249307,Joey,2008-09-14 02:30:00,9122,"Kind of a crummy death eh Ramble On, for both of them.  The pickerel suffocates and the pike starves to death.  That the real meaning of your eyes are bigger than your stomach     Or in this case, your throat!!  Joey"
249331,Cookslav,2008-09-14 04:10:00,1457,I can't beleive you picked it up It must have stunk BAD....  LOL
246184,Cudz,2008-09-03 13:57:00,2652,GCD.  I don't believeit is a Pacu.  I am pretty sure it is a piranha (red bellied).  They do look similar but pacu get a longer body when they get bigger but this fish still has the piranha shape.  The teeth are pointed as well.
246214,CLofchik,2008-09-03 15:30:00,854,"Pacu have weird teeth, almost human.  That's a piranha, probably got too big for somebody's tank...........and toilet  Pacu teeth:  "
246316,bassfighter,2008-09-03 21:02:00,366,"The chance of you catching a fish release by someone recently is so slim, I pray they are not second or third generation species.  If they are indeed Piranhas, what will happen 5 years from now? some areas will be unswimmable.  Hopefully the fish will not cross bread with other species, adapt to our climate and produce really carnivorous kind.  The Image of a Pacu fish showing human like teeth looks funny. They need some teeth whithener or brace to close tooth gap before picture taken."
246328,highdrifter,2008-09-03 21:36:00,2534,Looks like dinner to me!!  Talk about random.  Good thing they can't survive our canadian winters...  Pretty evil looking fish though.. yikes!  HD
246443,GBW,2008-09-04 01:44:00,8460," This fish is the Letterman, David fish as the gap in on the bottom and not the top..."
246468,camillj,2008-09-04 02:34:00,1988,Most definitely red bellied Pirhana... pretty big .. gott think it managed to survive a winter or two ... most likely didnt find breeding partner though
246479,Rizzo,2008-09-04 02:52:00,4754,"Zoinks, pretty scary stuff there. If any more get caught in rice this year you won't find me swimming there anytime soon"
247740,OFAH Invading Species,2008-09-08 20:27:00,1," Blue_Axela, could you please call the Invading Species Hotline, 1-800-563-7711. We would be interested in some more details about the fish, and possibly picking the fish up from you for identification, and to confirm the sighting.  Thanks,  David Copplestone"
247768,Blue_Axela,2008-09-08 21:40:00,88,"Hi David,  I was contacted via PM by Matthew.  I just called him back and left a voicemail.  I'm be more than happy to cooperate with the MNR.  I will get in touch with Matthew this week and set up a time when you can pick up the fish.  Rob."
247891,kennyman,2008-09-09 03:34:00,737,"One of the members here (vanillagorilla) showed me pics of himsef using 7lb piranha as bait in the amazon. I can't remember the name of the fish hey were catching with them. He said he fought one for 45 minutes but couldn't even move it. He was a former musky guide on the Ottawa so he's used to big toothy critters (saw pics of some incredible muskies too), but nothing like that. Anyway I thought it was interesting. Anything that can eat a 7lb piranha has got to be seriously nasty."
247895,BillM,2008-09-09 03:47:00,17367,"kennyman: Sounds like he might have been fishing for Arapaima, 15ft long and up to 500lbs, lol...  Here is a National Geographic video:"
247896,GbayGiant,2008-09-09 04:10:00,1780," A 50""+ musky would and could easily eat a 7lbs piranha or any fish 7lbs and even bigger, lol, I've seen it happen first hand that's what makes them such an origional fish, they have been found dead on shore with big carp hanging out of their mouths (they can get a little greedy and choke on big fish), but I hear you. I seen a discovery channel show where they were using big piranha as bait on the Amazon also, forget the name of that giant fish they were going for but they looked like a giant bowfin and get over 200lbs.    Piranha in a Ontario lake or any Canadian water period would never make it past ice up anyway and most likely die well before that, even if the tank at your house gets a couple degrees to cold in the winter they go belly up. Sorta the same reason I don't use shiners when the water gets to warm because they last about 2 minutes after a certain temp."
247897,Dozer,2008-09-09 04:10:00,896,"I would love to catch an arapaima, seen a documentary on one of those once... jeez.  Damn invasive species!  Stupid earthlings."
247898,guangcz,2008-09-09 04:54:00,2,holly...that teeth looks exactly like human teeth.
248009,Tie Twist,2008-09-09 18:26:00,10,"Once while I was seening some firewood I seen the biggest Musky that anyone claims to have ever saw. It was like a saw from a movie, I wanted to throw my seen at it, but it was a chainseen, and the water would have wrecked it.  Quite a saw I seen."
248746,Burtess,2008-09-12 01:13:00,901, LMAO..
248778,Mattones,2008-09-12 02:33:00,587,It is a Pacu not a Piranha i have owned Piranha's for over 7 years. This is a very common mistake.
248803,Ramble,2008-09-12 05:10:00,713,"You guys might like this, i posted it last year but it's definalty relivent here since the conversation seems to have gone of on a bit of a tangent lol  30 inch northern with a 16 inch walleye.    "
248864,Reef Runner,2008-09-12 13:26:00,980,"Cool photos Ramble On. Is that from Kesagami Lodge?  Guessing from the decomposition you found it floating.  A neat find, thanks or sharing."
248931,uglyfish,2008-09-12 16:05:00,981,"a pirhana could survive through a winter here. most animals will adapt to survive. and pirhana are caught in our waters more then u think, my friend lives in welland rite on the canal, and there were 3 caught at different times of the year not more then 100 yards from her house. oh, and 1 of the 3... was caught during ice fishing season... other 2 were spring and summer catches"
245996,Blue_Axela,2008-09-02 23:39:00,88,My neighbour caught this out of Rice Lake this past weekend.  I have never seen a fish like this ever...she gave it to me to take pictures and contact the MNR if neccessary.  It was caught with a worm.  Is this just a case of someone dumping their pet fish into the lake?  Or is it an invasive species?  Here are some pics of it.   One thing is for sure...it is ugly and has teeth...

245999,northamfishing,2008-09-02 23:43:00,10,looks like a pirahna to me.
246000,danbo,2008-09-02 23:44:00,2646,Piranha!
246001,danc,2008-09-02 23:44:00,4677,Yup. It's a Piranha.
246002,hammercarp,2008-09-02 23:47:00,964,"Whoa. That's serrasalmus nattereri . The red bellied piranha. I hope you are just fooling around. If you aren't, there is a major league idiot out there. I mean the one that released it into the lake."
246003,Blue_Axela,2008-09-02 23:48:00,88,Someone educate me.  Are Piranhas salt or fresh water fish?  I thought they were salt water fish found in the Amazon...lol.
246004,Blue_Axela,2008-09-02 23:49:00,88,  I am not fooling around.  This was fished out of Rice Lake this past weekend.  I have it frozen at the cottage.
246006,MCTFisher9120,2008-09-02 23:50:00,3761,"o my god if those things start breeding a HUGE mess will emerge. Not good, glad u caught it. Released?Killed?"
246008,danbo,2008-09-02 23:51:00,2646,
246009,Musky or Specks,2008-09-02 23:51:00,2710,Fresh Water. They seem to get released into ponds and lakes every year but they are tropical and they cant survive our winters. The biggest risk as with all aquarium fish is disease
246013,hammercarp,2008-09-03 00:00:00,964,M or S is right. It still is a really twisted thing to do.   I have read that they taste good though.
246016,Grimace,2008-09-03 00:01:00,2020,Yep.   It would die in the winter.    Some brain-dead threw it into the lake.   Hopefully they will eat all the goldfish that have been thrown into the lake before winter lol
246017,Sandbag,2008-09-03 00:02:00,533,Pretty good sized one at that.  I can't believe someone would release anything like that into one of our water bodies.  I hope Musky or Specks is right with not being able to survive the winter.  Cheers  Craig
246018,Blue_Axela,2008-09-03 00:02:00,88,"  Not about to try. But whoever wants it and is willing to drive to lake to get it, its frozen in my freezer and ready."

246072,oncogene,2008-09-03 01:26:00,154," Piranhas are freshwater fish. You are right about the part that they'r from Amazon... except Amazon is a freshwater body, not saltwater   Most likely they wont' survive. BUT there's always exception. I've read reports of tropical fish (mostly small ones like tetras etc) that managed to survive as small colonies in warmer water of cold geographic regions.... say warm water exhaust from power plants or what not."
246082,Joey,2008-09-03 01:44:00,9122,"Well, since there's global warming, it should be fine  Joey"
246091,hogman3006,2008-09-03 01:50:00,41,I would report it to the MNR and see what they have to say.
246093,keram,2008-09-03 01:52:00,585," But this one has already experienced "" local cooling""  . it is in the freezer"
