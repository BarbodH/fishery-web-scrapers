249593,bassjnkie,2008-09-14 22:46:00,1101,Thanks for the heads up. I know what I'm haveing Friday

249602,Spiel,2008-09-14 22:54:00,9065,"....Hmmmm, personally I find it rather difficult to support my local (or non local) gillnetters."
249603,Greencoachdog,2008-09-14 22:56:00,8163,  Did you say that outloud just now?
249605,Spiel,2008-09-14 22:57:00,9065," Outloud, no I typed it."
249624,4thgen,2008-09-14 23:38:00,157,"Alot of the time ""Zander"", a close European relative of the Walleye, is sold as ""Pickerel"" in North America. I doubt you can tell the difference by taste though. Just thought I would share."
249637,fishindevil,2008-09-14 23:57:00,6254,"Most walleye sold to loblaws,is gillnetted in dirty old lake winnepeg !!!!!... and i will not ever support any native activities in any way !!!! i catch my own legally..."

249657,Rich,2008-09-15 00:42:00,3927,"Let's not get into that debate!  Glad you enjoyed the Loblaws pickerel. Must be good stuff, our seafood dept. is constantly sold out. I can't ever justify myself buying fish.. nor can Sugarpacket, she's always telling me I have too much in the freezer as it is. (which really isn't much.. a half limit of lake erie perch and a couple brook trout)"
249661,bigugli,2008-09-15 00:48:00,6138,I haven't heard #2 in years.  I guess I'll clean off my screen and keyboard now.  There's just something foreign about buying fish unless it is in a can or jar.
