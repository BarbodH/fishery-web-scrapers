I put it over the garage like in the picture, well I don't want to use a ladder everytime I need a rod. Now I use the greay home depot hooks, screwed into the joists in the basement ceiling. Nice and neat, easy to get to.  The rod holder in the link has to be mounted high up or else you get poked in the eye if they are low.  I will post some pics of my setups, by the way those berkley locking holder are really good.  Here are the pics of my 3 setups, works for me. But just an idea        "

249569,kickingfrog,2008-09-14 21:42:00,8333,"  The best ideas are almost always simple. My wife is so excited about the hook idea that she is ready to go out and buy them for me.... Did I mention that I'm sitting in our living room, surrounded by my tackle as I try to prepare for Lakair.... I think she figures to put me on one of those hooks."

249684,rob v,2008-09-15 01:38:00,535,"Daniel M. - I like your ideas even better.  Thanks a lot for sharing.  I know where my rods will be ""hanging"" out this winter.  Thanks again."
