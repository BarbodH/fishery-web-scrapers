248630,Marko,2008-09-11 19:06:00,854,SOme of the methods are discussed in this topic http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=23717
248631,BillM,2008-09-11 19:08:00,17367,I would suggest voodoo or perhaps one of those dolls you put the spikes in.
248633,ccmtcanada,2008-09-11 19:10:00,7971," LOL...  I thought the same thing, but the pins/spikes just wreck the eggs.  Maybe yell some profanities at it?  Seriously though, check out that link provided by Marko."
248635,Marko,2008-09-11 19:14:00,854,I was going to comment on the topic title as well but i figured i`d leave it to you guys
248642,solopaddler,2008-09-11 19:29:00,8605,"Excellent topic.  While I personally don't curse my own eggs, I do sometimes feel as though I'm cursed on the river. That's speaking figuratively of course."
248644,jdmls,2008-09-11 19:39:00,575,"Yet , no matter how bad you know they are gonna smell, you always have to give them a sniff, LOL"
248650,ketchenany,2008-09-11 19:53:00,3229,"Forget them in the vest and then go to Timmies on your next trip wearing the vest!  ""old fishermen never die, they just smell that way"""
248677,solopaddler,2008-09-11 21:34:00,8605,"Aww, someones ruining all the fun!  (stop editing  )"
248678,ccmtcanada,2008-09-11 21:40:00,7971,Ohhhhhhhhhhh.....  Now I understand.....
248702,chickenhawk,2008-09-11 22:57:00,612,try the ever popular chinny spell......but you would have to travel to the enchanted Bronte creek to find a 50 pound king sittin in the shallows.....talk to him and he'll give you the curse.....or he will curse you....MUAHAHAHAHA   P.S. that was an evil laugh
248724,Canuck2fan,2008-09-12 00:03:00,1444," Ummm you don't want to be waiting until next year to go catch the trout...... You will do much better fishing the tribs with it until from NOW until freeze up. In the spring the best bait to get going is using rainbow spawn closely followed by worms. The fish that come into a river in the spring don't ever see salmon spawn, so they don't seem to like it as much as the fall river bows. The rainbows who follow the salmon up the rivers this fall have quite the feeding frenzy on salmon roe. So use it to get some rainbow skein tie that in daily lots and freeze for the spring and late winter."
248813,denisk,2008-09-12 08:59:00,163,put it in baby food jars and freeze it
248923,Fang,2008-09-12 15:47:00,1330,"I do my brown, rainbow and salmon roe this way. Has always fished well and frozen well. Was using 5 year old brown roe this spring for trout opener.  1 cup brown sugar 1 cup salt 1.5 liters water  add all ingredients and heat water until all is dissolved Let cool to room temp Fill airtight containers 3/4 full with roe Gently pour solution over eggs and add a bit more solution to fully cover Close lid tighly and freeze.  When thawing avoid refreezing any more than 1-2 times as frost will start forming inside container and damage eggs  simple and it works"
248941,badboi,2008-09-12 16:34:00,12,"The way I did it back in BC was.....  take all the skeins and lay them out on newspaper and sprinkle non-iodized salt on them and ProCure  this will dry them out and you may have to switch the newspaper once or twice depending on how much juice comes out of them  wait until the eggs are the right firmness you prefer, most people like them like gummy worms.....  once they are the right firmness immerse them in Borax and you now can freeze them.  Only take out what you need when you go fishing, dont freeze-thaw them repeatedly. You can also cut them to bait sized pieces before you borax them so its more convienant on the river.  good luck"
248946,tybrad,2008-09-12 16:54:00,45,for the longest time i was reading the post title as Cursing salmon eggs lol
249070,Rich,2008-09-13 00:06:00,3927,"I simply take them home and rinse them off in distilled water, then freeze them in whatever container is convenient. I tie enough bags for each day and keep the rest frozen. Works well enough for me."
