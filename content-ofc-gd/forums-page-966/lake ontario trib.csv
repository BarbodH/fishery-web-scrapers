248660,napjohn8,2008-09-11 20:22:00,46,So i decided to head out to a local lake Ontario trib that was expecting to have salmon because after the 15+mm of rain we have received in the last week it would be ample for the salmon to begin staging and running. Last year at this time i was at the river and believe me the salmon were running. I am feeling that this year their behavior is weird. I haven't seen any in the water today and it wasn't murky it was close to a chocolate stain but was clear enough in the pool to see no activity.

248769,ccmtcanada,2008-09-12 02:19:00,7971,"Same here, I've seen them jumping at river mouths and piers for a few weeks now.  I hear they are running up the creeks, but I don't fish for them there, so I can't say for sure."
248784,chickenhawk,2008-09-12 03:02:00,612,yeah i was uptop yesterday and there were fish everywhere and they were still moving up.....so they are definately in full swing now....  Hawk

The minnows are up thick so the salmon ought to be up too, maybe I just wasn't lookin' or casting hard enough."

249297,Rich,2008-09-14 02:08:00,3927,I have a feeling looking at your display pic we've actually met at the river!
