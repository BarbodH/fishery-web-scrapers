249015,fish_finder,2008-09-12 21:06:00,370,there are no fish in the mad river
249028,Fisherman,2008-09-12 21:53:00,7201,"Ditto to what Fish finder said.  Many years ago there was a spill of some sort, wiped out pretty much everything.  Since then there are a  few rainbow and sucker, creek chub and one other specie that I won't say, that call it home.  There's the rare salmon that takes the wrong turn (probably female)  , but that's about it.  I wish they would stock a few salmon and rainbow in there to get things going again."
