Lot's of nice Pike, but no Bass! I've seen them come out of there but so far they avade me...  Any suggestions? Lures, times, weather, location, etc....  Thanks!"

248296,super dave,2008-09-10 16:02:00,323,"My friends were just there yesterday.  Use baits that targets bass more such as a plastic worm or senko.  If you chuck spinnerbaits all day, the pike won't give the bass a chance to eat it."
248523,gogu392,2008-09-11 13:15:00,142,"As I remenber, live bait (any kind) is not alowed at Mountsberg. And no gas motor on boat, only electric. Anyway the lake have a lot of weed, therefore host mostly pike. Too bad that this nice lake is overfish by ""animals"" who left all sort of garbage behind. Every time when I am going there I have to take home some garbage which is not mine. For luching a boat or just parking the car is a $10 fee."
