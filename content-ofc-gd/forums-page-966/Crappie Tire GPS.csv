248689,Casey123,2008-09-11 22:39:00,461,"Anyone bought this unit yet...It is 1/2 price.  Michelle and I need a new one, would like to get some feed back about this unit."
248710,Wild,2008-09-11 23:30:00,704,"Good unit I picked one up too, it has street map software included."
248743,gdelongchamp,2008-09-12 00:54:00,199,How much is half price? No flyer handy.
248749,Fisherman,2008-09-12 01:17:00,7201,"$399 down to $199, (400/200)"
248863,Reef Runner,2008-09-12 13:22:00,980,"I bought my venture HC at Radioworld for $150.  Check them out 4reel, they have better prices.  I'm not sure if the CTC comes with adavnced software, the venture I bought just came with the basic map.  If you search on the net you can find some downloadable topomaps.  The unit itself,  I love it.  Very easy to use.  Great on battery life.  Picks up a signal even in deep bush.  Accurate.  I would recommend it to anyone.  Tells us how you make out if you decide to purchase it, you wont be dissapointed."
248866,Wild,2008-09-12 13:31:00,704,This is called  the roads & recreation pack. It comes with more than the GPS unit. The Metroguide CD should be worth about 100 itself.
248929,douG,2008-09-12 15:54:00,2693,"Another great buy is the Garmin 76CSX for $269 from GPS City.  This unit has a bigger screen, better sensitivity, waterproof and it floats."
248930,dharapiak66,2008-09-12 16:03:00,6,thanks for the heads up on the sale 4 reel. i just got back from canadian tire and had to order one as they were sold out and today is the last day for the sale.will come in handy when i visit my brother in hamilton. hope it's a good one.
248957,Wild,2008-09-12 17:36:00,704,Doug is right and I prefer this over the venture as it has more features including routing but this does not include maps so be prepared to buy a CD if you don't have one already.  By the way anyone care to swap a bluechart for a metroguide?
248983,bbog,2008-09-12 19:08:00,665,Swapping is not so easy - Bluechart and Metroguide is locked to the device it was installed on.
248987,Wild,2008-09-12 19:26:00,704,No problem Barnie  Unlocking is easy.
249051,Radnine,2008-09-12 23:01:00,1538,"I just checked with our Caledonia CT. They had none (I got a rain check) but she said that Stoney Creek and Hamilton Centre had 5 left each. I checked Radioworld and they are $149, but Canadain Tire's is a bundle that icludes ""MapSource MetroGuide Canada CD, dash mount, USB cable, 12V charger"" All extra at Radioworld. If anyone knows why I should not get one of these, please say now. Thanks, Jim"
249122,jace,2008-09-13 02:57:00,472,"  for me, the 1 deciding factor for this package is not the included extras but the fact that this unit does not use memory expansion cards.  I just checked and Metroguide for just ontario regions is 60-70M, this unit ony has 24M internal memory.   If you want topo for offroad info and you`re looking at even larger maps.    Anyways, if you don`t mind loading and reloading maps, these units are good, but they will be a bit of a pain for long trips covering a lot of ground.  ...for example, a road trip on a motorcycle down to florida..useless without bringing a laptop.    That is a nice group of accessories but it`s a big tradeoff."
249128,Radnine,2008-09-13 04:17:00,1538,"At the risk of sounding like a moron, I am not sure what you just said. Are you saying that there is not enough room in this unit for large maps? Let me ask this: If I go to Doe lake, will it have it on there somewhere and will it help me to find the shoal? Or will it have the water depths in Erie marked? I am not much of a drive to Florida type, but I would like to mark some spots on different lakes for return trips. Have I got the right unit? Thanks, Jim"
249129,Radnine,2008-09-13 04:31:00,1538,"Let me respond to my own post. I do sound like a moron. Since then, I have searched this site for GPS threads and learned loads. But I have mostly learned that I have much to learn. Thanks all."
249133,jace,2008-09-13 06:03:00,472,"I wanted to say that I think this GPS is good but you were looking for 1 reason  not buy it...that would be mine.  Having unexpandable memory would not be an issue for a lot of users.   Having only fixed internal memory also means you cannot buy any preconfigured map cards/chips for this particular unit.  you have to build and load anything you want to use.  The H series gps's have good receivers and the venture/vista/legends are nice and small.  Size is the one disadvantage of the GPSMAP 76CSx mentioned in another reply, it's a monster when you have to carry that thing around.  I have the 60CSx and it's a differnt shape but roughly the same bulkyness as the 76, and that's my tradeoff.   Most GPS's come with nothing installed except a basic undetailed continental map unless it's a unit pre-packaged for a specific buyer in mind.  kinda like this ctc sale unit.  You can mark spots on any gps with no maps installed.  it'll be a blank screen with the path you're moving on and you that's how it used to be."
