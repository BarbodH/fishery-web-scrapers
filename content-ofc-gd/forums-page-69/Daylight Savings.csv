1024318,chris.brock,2018-03-11 13:09:00,4053,"I'm a little different, I don't like having to change the clocks, it messes me up and I like the middle ground like March and September, "
1024324,huzzsaba,2018-03-11 14:08:00,884,Totally agree with you Chris.  I don't see a point.  Hopefully we can do like some provinces have done and scrap it.
1024327,grimsbylander,2018-03-11 15:12:00,3016,I think they should scrap too! But it's here for now and I hate 5:30pm darkness.

Gave me a good chance to have a #1 Special breakfast with my relief. $1.99 for bacon, Ham or Sausage, 2 eggs home fries toast an coffee from the canteen. More than a few times I would pick up the Friday fish dinner for $2.99 and bring them home for supper. Saturdays was Shepherds Pie. Remember those deals from the main canteen next to the Scrap Yard and my Dad's office Fish Farmer? The bonus was they were great tasting and a lot of food to boot. When this was debated more than a few times to scrap it I read that savings time was put in place so kids were not waiting for the bus or walking to school in the dark, or was that in the fall? Yea the Fall. I remember when we didn't switch but the US did. Only lasted 1 or 2 years."

Woke up at the same old time of 4:30am, and still got to said spot as the sun started to rise. Mind over matter. Plus my pops says, why change the clock, it will be right in the fall. LMAO"
1024351,Moosebunk,2018-03-11 22:56:00,3970,Work in Coral Harbour... that town decided daylight savings time isn't for them so they don't change the clocks.  Council decision.  More towns here should try it.

1024497,pics,2018-03-14 21:23:00,1268,The kids would be walking to the bus stop in complete darkness.. Since there is a driver shortage they have some schools starting early so that the buses can do a second run to a different school that starts later..
