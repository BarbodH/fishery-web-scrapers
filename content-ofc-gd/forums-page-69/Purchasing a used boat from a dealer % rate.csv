Im just praying the motor holds up! I bought a yamaha in the hopes that it would!"
1023757,aplumma,2018-02-28 20:16:00,6896,The tell tail or pisser hole is a visual if the pump is working. The older motors have two alarms at least on my evinrude it is a low oil and a thermal overheating gauge. I do not have a water pressure gauge on a 1989 GTX150.Not a bad idea but I have lived without one. I will warn you that my boat at full throttle is consuming 9/10th of a gallon per minute with 2 14 gallon tanks. If you have a single tank keep an eye on what 1/2 tank is visually until you are sure the gauge is working correctly. I would bring an extra gas can till you are sure. I first filled my tank and then ran it to 1/2 tank then refilled it and it took 7 gallons so I know that it was accurate. I also have a flasher unit that is accurate when going fast so it warns me before a slower rising bottom bites me. If you do find yourself in to thin water I trim the motor up quickly and chop the throttle before the rpms rev up. This will give you a better chance of not ripping the lower unit off as the boat drops off plane. Then use the trolling motor and get to deeper water after changing your shorts. Art
1023758,grimsbylander,2018-02-28 20:17:00,3016,"Life jackets: I don't know anything about what exactly happened on Big O but I do know there are multiple other instances of guys getting hurt because of the auto-inflatables. Two issues 1) they don't always inflate and inflating most of the time isn't good enough. I wear mine when the big motors off and I'm fishing only. 2) the school jackets are foam filled. This provides padding in the event you catch a rogue wave,,etc and get pitched. I wear the padded jacket when buzzing along and switch to fish. It's no big deal to do that because my regular jacket stays tethered to the kill switch so I never forget that either. I'm kind of surprised there's no water pressure gauge but I'm not a Skeeter/Yamaha expert. Personally, I wouldn't go adjusting motor height without one. I can drop my water pressure 5 psi just with my trim button. You could easily add one I would think. Check to see if there's a tiny 1/8"" hole on the leading edge of the lower unit  just below the cav plate.  There's always the "" if it's not broke, don't fix it"" approach but I'm a stickler for weird crap on my toys. lol Word of advise on motor height...the guys on BBC will tell you the perfect height BUT you don't necessarily want it! You want it set so you have good hole shot and decent top end of course, but, in your case it's also important to have good ""bite"" in choppy water. Those guys will wring a half mph out of it but run on ponds all day. Last thing, do you have a spare prop and hub? I carry a spare stainless prop but on GBay at least get a cheapy aluminum as a minimum. Make up a toolkit with fuses(see what the boat is using), elec. tape, pliers, multi screwdriver, stainless screws, extra boat plug(don't ask), and a small socket set. Generally, the only thing to worry about on a bassboat is the loose nut behind the wheel. Let me know if the boat's gelcoat needs sealed. Search ProTec on BBC."
1023759,grimsbylander,2018-02-28 20:32:00,3016,"Georgian Bay has one slow rising spot...it's called Wasaga Beach! lol Many areas you can be 10 feet from shore in 60 FOW or a mile from shore in 6"". The change in depth can be less than the length of your boat! If you're running on GBay and look down to see <3' of water, it's too late. lol Fuel: Yup more fuel...but, I used to run around Gbay  in a tinny with a Merc 35hp and everywhere you go is at WOT. Running many miles all day I burnt a lot of fuel and carrying an extra 5 gallon tank sucked. Now, my boat burns more fuel per hour but I run a lot less time! What used to be a 25-30 min run is now 10 and that's not flat out. Still more fuel but not as bad as I thought it would be."
1023772,OhioFisherman,2018-02-28 23:30:00,6623,"In like 25 years of going there I made it as far as Table Rock 2--3 times, there really was no clear benefit of traveling that far. LOL risk vs reward? a lot of rocks on the way? Besides your fuse panel your boat motor may have a fuse under the cowl, if it goes bad on you your motor won't start, had that happen on my mini merc one time, luckily I was within electric motor range of a marina, I always carried spares after that, and never needed them again."
1023775,aplumma,2018-03-01 00:06:00,6896,I think the biggest difference between the rivers and lakes is up North you have basins that the glaciers striped of soil and the rock areas are more cliff like. Down here we have basins that are full of sediment and not cliff like. Running major size rivers usually your dangers are flotsam  or deadheads more than sheer walls and shoals. Our smaller rivers they tend to have very thin water and rapids so a bass boat is NOT the correct boat. You can run them in a canoe but I hate float trips and having to park a vehicle at the down stream location to pull out. For those rivers we use a jetboat that can go both up and down river under power. Art
1023781,Moosebunk,2018-03-01 02:04:00,3970," Read the thread to this point... Not for one second would I trade the last 8 years fishing out of a 16+ foot tiller. Lake Ontario, Lake Nipigon, the Larry and Ottawa, St.Clair and right into skinny little back lakes with crap launches, none of it ever a problem. Chasing spring gar it gets into shallower water than even the bass boats really ever need to go, but then come fall will roll in the big water for skis and eyes.  Full control, no probs with three guys and their gear reaching plane and 30mph, handles the big water, a 60HP that sips fuel, and under 2000 pounds boat and trailer which pulls like nothing, you had me believing in the beginning that your starter boat could very well end up being the boat you're happy to finish with too. 15K is a good budget for a used fishing boat.... and like Bill, on a HELOC would be a good way to go.  Right now they're about prime plus one give or take. So around 4 to 5% I'd think...?"
1023792,AKRISONER,2018-03-01 14:20:00,5558,"Art this is actually one interesting point because what used to take me a very very long time to drive to wont take me very long anymore. Plus in a 14 foot tinny your one 25 litre jerry can is a small reservoir in comparison to a boats fuel storage. Same plan as normal, decide where you are going, and then never exceed that distance, only hit spots that are on the way home if you want to change it up. your boat burns over 4 litres of fuel per minute???!!! how much power are you pushing holy cow. On G bay, if I see a problem going fast....i may as well brace for impact cause its game over for sure. This is one thing my old man taught me, you only drive the boat fast on your 10th pass over the same spot and even then, you dont drive fast because you never know what can be floating in the water. Grimsby is 100% correct about how stupid Gbay is...in fact one of my favourite fishing spots is on the side of an island that is about 400 meters long. The first 100 meters  of shoreline is a flat area with a shoal thats 10 fow 50 meteres out from shore but then drops to 60FOW basically instantly... the next 100 meters and you can hop out of the boat onto shore and your boat is sitting in 60FOW, the next 100 meters is a 15 foot deep set of flats that juts out 200 meters from shore, but if you get within 20 meters of shore theres just a random shelf that comes up to 2fow is almost like a natural wave break because on the other inside of the 20 meter rock wall its still 10 FOW right up to shore, and then the final 100 meters of shoreline is a giant 12 foot deep weed bed that spans out from the island 500 meters out into the middle of the lake, and the weed clumps all have open channels of exposed rock....if thats doesnt describe how georgian bay works....then i dont know what does... Lucky for me Pointe au baril's main drive paths are very very well charted and marked, so it allows you to easily get to a generalized area safely when running a good GPS and following the bouoys...typically when going to new areas and due to the complete lack of charting on Gbay i drive where I am going on the driveline and then pull the motor up and drop the bow mount to figure out the rest. Luckily G bay has some very very clear water as well so typically its easy to spot rocks when driving slow like that or being on the bow mount. Excellent details from an experienced boater, these tips are gold. From my visits with the boat, the gelcoat looks really really good, the thing is a garage queen, got dropped in a lake, fished for a day and then was taken home. boat was waxed etc regularily...not a single mark of dock rash or anything on it. Im still torn about my storage situation, I have a boat house that i can park it in, or I can throw it on a trailer but then I wont have anything to neccesarily keep it out of the sun and elements...thats a whole other debate...to park in the water inside a boat house, or to put on trailer outside weekly. The hull is going to get stained regardless unfortuntatly for me, the inside of channel of pointe au baril is tea stained due to the sediment at the bottom of the lake, i dont get the benefit of that gin clear water 2 kilometers away.  yup, definitely need to get a pile of fuses to throw in the boat I got offered 4.5% on the Heloc...I think youve shown us bunk, the boat doesnt catch the fish, the fisherman does."
1023794,BillM,2018-03-01 14:39:00,17367,"Lots of charts available for Gbay, make sure you pick up the latest Navionics for the units you're going to run on the new rig."
1023797,AKRISONER,2018-03-01 15:12:00,5558,"Haha bill, you think im a maniac? lol Im running the latest navionics software, you cant drive that lake without it!. If you think that stuff is accurate unless you are driving main drive lines, you have a death wish ahaha.  Huge swaths of the lake are either A) totally uncharted see example below or B ) just very sparsely charted aka missing entire shoals, rocks and other fun things that will destroy your boat lol Its probably a good thing i spent 15 years driving a boat that couldnt go over 20kmh...kept the leg on the bottom of  my outboard. hey...im not complaining cause this slows the flood of citiots down...I could probably sell the autocharting that ive done in the area lol...but this way my fishing spots dont get ruined as easily.  "
1023799,grimsbylander,2018-03-01 15:16:00,3016,"Personally, I wouldn't leave my boat sitting in the water all summer. Trailer, boat cover and throw a tarp over it when it's going to sit for a week."
1023802,BillM,2018-03-01 15:46:00,17367,Running outside the channels in Gbay is like playing Russian Roulette.   From 100ft to 1ft in a matter of feet.   Gotta love it!   I've got a couple of new spring pike spots that require long runs.  that should be interesting
1023806,grimsbylander,2018-03-01 16:22:00,3016,"^^^ lol Russian Roulette is about right. With the amount of people that hit rocks, we used to joke that the water in GBay was just an optical illusion."
1023807,aplumma,2018-03-01 16:28:00,6896,"The carburetors on mine are the gtx series which are quite fuelish. The motor needed to be rebuilt a few years back and I milled the heads, once over on the pistons and a few other tricks to get more power out of it. I figured while i was inside to modify it for more power. I run a 3 blade SS cupped prop. and carry and use the aluminum one when I am up North. A full set of plugs, fuses, basic socket set and hand tools, distress flag and flare gun are always on board as well as the Canadian legal requirements. One item I also found really useful is a nerf football it can be jammed in a hole in the hull in an emergency. So far I haven't used it on the fiberglass boat but it saved the day when I popped a hole in the aluminum boat running the rapids. Flat out with the SS prop I am doing 57 MPH which is just plain fun in my mind it helps that gas is around $2.50 a gallon in the summer.  Art"
1023815,AKRISONER,2018-03-01 18:24:00,5558,"if youve never hit a rock on Gbay have you really boated? at that price, id probably buy gas just to burn it for fun...holy crap! Marina gas these days is pushing 9 bucks a gallon pluma lol"
1023818,Lape0019,2018-03-01 18:54:00,647,"Congrats on the purchase! After reading through all of the posts, I will say that a WP gauge isn't a requirement but is highly recommended. I didn't have one on the Tracker with the 75 but the new boat has one and I will be paying close attention to it. with the Tracker, I never played around with engine height or anything so it wasn't an issue. If you have a jack plate and make adjustments to it, the WP gauge will allow you to see if you have gone too far (drop in pressure).  If you don't care for max speed, I wouldn't even touch the setup. It has worked for the previous owner for years so it will probably work for you. And from what I have seen, you probably won't have any issues with chine walk with your setup (that's what scares me the most for this year). It may not be fast enough for you to worry about. Drive it like you would your buddies Legend to start with and figure out its idiosyncrasies. Every boat is different and it will take you a while to truly understand how it handles. Take your time and figure it out. It took me almost 2 seasons to fully understand or anticipate what my old boat would do when I chopped the throttle or trimmed up. Oh! and APLUMMA (as always) provided some great advice there but be careful when chopping the throttle. With bass boats, its better to trim down first and then decelerate instead of just chopping the throttle. Nasty stuff has happened to people who just decided to decelerate with the throttle. May not be an issue with your boat because of the size and HP/speed but just keep it in the back of your mind. I know for me, coming out of a 75HP boat and going into a  225HP boat, I will be taking her easy for quite some time. I know how to drive a boat at 45MPH. Not so much at 70MPH. You are pretty much in the same scenario. With extra speed, comes extra precautions so take it easy until you understand what the boat will do and how it will handle certain situations."
1023819,AKRISONER,2018-03-01 20:14:00,5558,"I didnt even know Chine walk was a thing until now...holy hell that scares the Bejeesus outta me. I can imagine there are a lot of idiots out there that would hop in a boat that can do 100 and basically pin it the first day on the water....not my intention at all. Pointe au baril is typically too friggin rough to be running that fast anyways...i mean you can do it, but it also beats the living hell out of your boat. I will slowly learn what it does at each speed progressivly getting quicker until I hit top end. At this point I think the 45mph that our alumacraft can do feels very fast so I can only imagine what pushing past 50+ would feel like...I dont even really think I am one to drive that quick unless conditions are totally ideal and Im purposely deciding to drive really fast...I find driving around at 40mph plenty quick to get around anyways. The boat doesnt have a jack plate to allow for quick adjustments like that so I definitely wont be messing around with my outboard height until Im done getting the basics the way that I want them...then i can start talking about making adjustments, but until then I am sure that the boat will run just fine, the fine tuning can come once I am settled in with it. Its a small boat with a pretty big motor for its size...the insurance company tells me so"
1023825,aplumma,2018-03-01 21:43:00,6896,I guess I should elaborate on chopping the throttle. I will be running around 50 mph and as i approach a wake go back to 1/4 throttle before you hit the wake it will raise the nose quickly and then power back up to match the speed of the other side of the wake. You will not really have time to trim the motor and since you are not getting off plane you should be able to not needing to trim the motor. With less than a one foot chop you can trim out till you are running on the pad with no issues of chin walk. The water splashing off the side of the boat will tell you when you are solidly on the pad.It will be right next to the driver or slightly behind. The best run is down wind with a 1 foot chop you are sitting about 2 ft eye level above the water so the feeling of flying is real. If you can't trim out porpoising increase your speed till it settles. Most bass boats either are off plane or on the pad. The 89 Ranger 18ft does not like to go slower than 28 mph and finds the pad around 30 it really depends on how the boat is loaded. I have 3 batteries and 185 lbs of fuel in the back of the boat. on rough water or when I need more control from porpoising I will fill the front live well to give me a little more nose weight. When it really gets snotty I will have my fishing buddy sit on the lip of the front casting deck. Finally wax is your friend for keeping scumlines down and don't park against black rubber tire. They are a bugger to clean off the finish. Enjoy. Art
1023826,grimsbylander,2018-03-01 23:06:00,3016,"That boat will not chine walk at 50-52 mph. It only happens when the boat rocks on the pad and I just can't see that boat getting enough  transom lift to fall off the pad. My best speeds are into the wind, not downwind, with a good chop. Every boat is different and driving time is the only way to learn. You'll figure out the best trim to come out of the hole, the best speed for jumping wakes(lol), er, safely crossing wakes, and what a comfortable running speed is. If you know an experienced driver, get him to go out with you. You'll learn more in one hour than will will in a month on your own. That includes loading and unloading the boat on the trailer. Super Important!! I assume it's a bunk trailer? BTW, where's a freaking picture?"
1023835,AKRISONER,2018-03-02 13:12:00,5558,"The 3 batteries and livewells are all located in the back of the boat so pourposing is definitely a concern, I imagine I have enough power here to push through it though. I dont believe that  I have enough power to chine all over...every video on youtube of it the guys are pushing well over 60 and this boat isnt ever going to get going that quick. You guys really are some crazy buggers, chopping throttle and jumping wakes ahhaha holy cow. Plumma are you literally saying you will be pinned at full throttle then slam it back to 1/4 throttle and then power it back to full? or are you saying you are at full throttle, and then drop to 3/4 throttle then back to 4? hahah holy cow the day i try this will be a day that I am feeling very adventerous...ive always just backed off the throttle no matter what the boat and quartered wakes then sped back up...never been one to hammer it over the wake, i prefer to be not concussed lol. Grimsby, i literally only have acquaintances with bass boats, all of my immediate fishing friends and family are either in multispecies boats or the young guys are running 16 foot aluminums. Gonna be on my own on this one...as far as I am aware, i am the only full time cottager up in PAB with a bass boat, we get a few visitors around but nobody thats there all year. I think last year I saw 2 true bass boats up there all year lol Interesting you guys are saying chop makes your boat actually go faster? Im guessing its that it provides more air space beneath the boat reducing drag? Ive never thought of this concept. I wasnt going to bother posting pictures of my boat in someone elses garage, i figured itd be better to get photos once shes on the water! but because you ask, its too hard for me to not want to share with you guys lol  Even funnier is you know I have a bunch of photos on my camera of it lol          "
1023842,Lape0019,2018-03-02 15:08:00,647,"That's actually a really nice looking boat! and considering todays bot in the 17.5' world are powered by a max 115, a 130 is pretty big for that thing. My buddy had a pro craft the same size and another buddy has an Astro (pretty much same boat) with a 135 and both topped out around 50-55 with the proper prop. One had a jack plate, the other removed his. I know one has had some chine walking. not sure of the other but this really only happens at max speed and most learn to drive through it. It's just minor adjustments to the steering wheel to keep you on pad. Or the other option is to trim down a bit until the boat settles down. Until you are comfortable at WOT, you won't have to worry about it and like I wrote earlier, you may never even have to worry about it. I am also interested in what Lumma means. This thread has been beneficial to more than just you as I need to learn how to properly drive this thing as well. Luckily for me, many of my friends have18.5 footers capable of 60+ and one of the pro staffers who has had the same boat (and is buying another) has offered to take me out. Regardless, congrats again! looks like a great boat that has been really well cared for."
1023847,grimsbylander,2018-03-02 16:26:00,3016,"Pretty boat and it'll zip along nicely. Every boat is different regarding crossing wakes and running in big rough water. Especially throttle position...don't get hung up on where the throttle should be. What you want to accomplish when crossing a wake is to back off enough to drop off the pad which will drop the transom some. Art said raise the nose, same thing but regardless the boat angle will change and put more boat back in the water. This will increase stability as you cross the wakes."
1023848,OhioFisherman,2018-03-02 16:50:00,6623,"Dang Akri, it looks new? LOL on inland lakes here you have about 2 minutes max at or near top speed before you hit a no wake zone."
1023856,AKRISONER,2018-03-02 18:12:00,5558," Having looked a a few boats in person and 1,000,000 online I pretty much knew instantly when i saw it that it was going to be the one I was purchasing. If you want to tell how a guy has taken care of his boat when you go to see it, look at his garage, house and truck. The truck in the driveway was washed and its winter time, the house and gardens were all well kept and maintained and his garage floor was cleaner than my kitchen floor lol. I kept trying to find marks, dents, scratches, dock rash, loose screws, rust...anything...and i couldnt. When he got it running for me the second time i went to close the deal with him, he had fogged the engine in the fall so he cleared everything out, and put all new plugs in it for me. It was basically exactly what you would hope for when buying something used from someone. I generally take really good care of my stuff but even I doubt that i can keep up the level of maintenance and cleanliness that the boat is accustomed to lol.  Is it the third saturday in May this weekend?"
1023861,OhioFisherman,2018-03-02 19:11:00,6623,"LOL, spring fever has a whole new meaning this year?"
1023958,aplumma,2018-03-04 21:54:00,6896,That a really nice boat. It is the same lay out as my Ranger. The amount t of throttle chop depends on the size of the wake. I run in an area that has tinnies and 50ft yachts the effect is to get the boat off the pad and stable but the nose is high to keep you dry. Depending on the amount of air you get under the boat will tell you if going into or down wind is it's preferred direction. The Reason I rescued this boat was it was the last year of this hull design which i fell in love with. The boat was owned by my fishing buddy who moved to the coast and decided to sell it to get another style of boat. I rebuilt the lower deck and replaced the electronics. Replaced all of the seats and steering was changed to hydraulic. Rebuilt the motor and added a 24 volt system for the trolling motor. Lots of love and work went into it because of the memories of fishing with my friend Tommy T. Art
1023063,BillM,2018-02-16 22:36:00,17367,"Art, that jet boat sounds fun.  Any troots down there?"
1023066,aplumma,2018-02-16 23:43:00,6896,"Not so many trout only the small fly fishing versions. We have Snakeheads, Channel Cats, Blue Catfish, Stripers, Small and Largemouth, Perch, Blue gill and varieties, crappie both, and very limited walleye. The boat is a custom built outboard jet drive. It uses airboat controls where you sit about 4 ft from the bow and on the left is the stick steer and the right is the throttle. The motor is above the bottom of the boat and it needs 1ft of water to get on plane and not suck up rocks but on plane you need 4 inches of water. It is a blast to drive and you can run through the rapids with usually no issues. The bottom of the boat is 8 gauge or .16 of an inch. It will take a pretty good punch but I did rip the transom seam out once and a few assorted battle scrapes on it. I had to jam a nerf football piece in the hole to get back to the dock. (a great thing to keep on any boat). A hammer and a body spoon with a tig welder made it good as new. Art"

So after looking into getting a HELOC and speaking with the bank I ended up learning something pretty substantial about loaning rules and my personal finances. Without giving away my entire personal finances, my mortgage is not being done directly with one of the ""10 approved"" loaners as recognized by our banking institutions, therefore I am not able to attain a secured line of credit. As the bank said ""most people get mortgages from outside sources for bad reasons i.e. bad credit, construction loans etc etc..."" not the case at all for me. The banks will not even consider doing a value assessment of my home because even though I have a significant amount of equity in my home already, the lender gets first grab at the equity available in my home, and hence the bank wont touch it. I can still get an unsecured line of credit at an interest rate around 8%, but I think i may just have a chat with a family member instead, id rather pay the interest to them then the friggin bank!  After researching the HELOC and how cheap it really would be to get the small loan that i need to buy an older used boat, ive really started to look at boats, and i may have actually already found ""the one"" i went and saw it monday! Ive got a few boats to see this weekend but i really dont think anything will compare to the one that i saw...hopefully its still kicking around by sunday!"

1023574,lew,2018-02-26 13:47:00,12766,"Congrats on the purchase, you'll be real happy with that combo. When I packed in fishing 2 years ago I sold my deep V Skeeter & 150 Yamaha but it was by far the best boat/motor I've ever owned."
1023585,BillM,2018-02-26 15:07:00,17367,I hope the new boat has lots of glitter
1023593,John,2018-02-26 17:12:00,2956,"Definitely a fun ride, but don't let Art drive unless you take spare jockeys...."
1023679,AKRISONER,2018-02-27 14:04:00,5558,"Any tips on driving a bass boat? Im pretty darn cautious and not one to rip it full tilt very often, but from what Ive read around the internet, this set up will do mid 50's with a half tank of gas and the livewells empty. Thats a little different then the 29kmh my tinner topped out at lol."
1023695,OhioFisherman,2018-02-27 17:58:00,6623,Congrats! They are claiming 57mph on the gps on this one with 2 people and a 115.  
1023706,boombap,2018-02-27 20:49:00,310,It is crazy how cheap a used boat can be on monthly payments.. even factoring in interest. My payment is cheaper than renting a tinny once a month. Congrats man! Enjoy the new rig.
1023708,AKRISONER,2018-02-27 21:04:00,5558,"jesus ohio...i dont know if i necessarily believe it...but after moving the boat by hand last night its gotta be close. You can move the boat around easily by yourself. With a 130 two stroke, shes gonna zip for sure."
1023710,aplumma,2018-02-27 21:12:00,6896,With the motor trimmed all the way down accelerate till it is solidly on plane. then trim the motor up watching your RPMs when the trim is correct is when you stop gaining MPH or the motor rpms jump up due to prop venting. This is the most economical running speed. Now If the boat starts to porpoises trim the motor down until it is steady or you can increase the RPM to set the boat on the pad. While running on the pad the boat will feel very responsive to turning which will give you the ability to make moderate course changes easily and smoothly. For a full speed run once on the pad runn the RPMS up to maximum RPM of the engine minus 200 RPMS and then try trimming it up  to see if the RPMs increase. Trim the boat a small amount down till you get back to the RPMs as before without porpoising and add the final 200 RPM back in   In rough water you will need to keep the trim down and ride heavier on the mid to front of the boat. The danger of larger boat wakes is real and when approaching them it is better to approach them at a slight angle NOT A CROSS ANGLE and be ready to reduce the throttle  the boat usually will respond quickly to a throttle chop so be prepared to decelerate. I would say if you have a friend with a bass boat go out with them so you can feel how it feels in different maneuvers. You also should upgrade your life jackets to high end high speed rated jackets with 4 buckles and a collar. A  engine kill lanyard is a must and if it really is snotty I will wear a motorcycle helmet for the head/wind/eye protection.  Art
1023713,OhioFisherman,2018-02-27 21:32:00,6623,"It's not that big of a boat, as I recall one of my buddies procraft with a 150 would hit the low 50's, his was a 19 foot boat, just guessing you should be in that range. Art knows a lot more about driving that style of boat than me, a 17' 6"" fish hawk style boat would have done everything I needed it to do. LOL, been in a lot of bass boats, never even had the urge to drive one."
1023731,AKRISONER,2018-02-28 13:36:00,5558,"This is great...seems a lot like driving my buddies under powered Legend. You have to really trim down to get it out of the hole shot and then slowly trim up till you hit the sweet spot that you are on plane but not porpousing like crazy. As mentioned by Misfish, i am really looking forward to the expansion of the lake territory that I can now access in reasonable time. I can easily fish the entire Shawanaga Inlet with ease now. Theres almost more fishing opportunities than you could cover in an entire lifetime in that area. Should be fun, just gotta remember im in a fibreglass not an aluminum!"
1023732,Old Ironmaker,2018-02-28 14:33:00,8243,"Good for you Akri. Don't believe the old ""2 best days of a boat owner."" If and when you sell will be because you have a bigger boat coming some day."
1023738,OhioFisherman,2018-02-28 16:15:00,6623,""" I can easily fish the entire Shawanaga Inlet with ease now. "" It is a big area, in my slow boats it took me a few days just to cover spots I had caught fish at before."
1023742,AKRISONER,2018-02-28 17:40:00,5558,"For the most part Ohio, I have never fished distances exceeding 14 kilometers from home base as fuel supply and simply the time it takes painfully driving my short arm tiller make it not worth it. There is obviously really good fishing to be had within this range from base camp. With a boat that does 50mph instead of 12....the lake really starts to open up, just like misfish said. The only limitation now will be weather due to exposure once you head 20+ k to the south or 16k to the west. Pick your days!"
1023743,BillM,2018-02-28 17:44:00,17367,"Weather and rocks.   Gbay always has some surprises.  Plan your routes, go slow.  Once you learn a few things then you can bomb around doing 50mph and using all that fuel"
1023744,grimsbylander,2018-02-28 17:47:00,3016,"Make sure you KNOW the max rpm for that motor and the tach works good. Make sure you KNOW what the water pressure at WOT should be and that the gauge works. This is critical and get used to checking it while running(trimming affects WP). Measure the prop to pad and ask the boys over on BBC where you should be. Wear that kill switch religiously. Wear a old school life vest while running...not an auto-inflate, save that for when you're fishing."
1023756,AKRISONER,2018-02-28 19:40:00,5558,"sorry i keep saying misfish, its grimsby that was talking about opening up the lake! Grimsby, you are saying that theres a guage that actually measures the water pressure on newer boats. I honestly have never seen one! I know that mine didnt come with one. im stuck with the standard tack, volt and speedo (doesnt even have a trim guage) had the boat running, idling and going when i went to check it out...everything appeared to be working perfectly. New hydraulics on the trim as well replaced last year. I do indeed want to figure out what height to get the motor mounted to. Who knows what level he has the motor at currently. From what im reading online guys like to run the prop to pad at 3 1/2 but im sure the guys on BBC would have some input I will definitely post up about it. I like your comment about not using an autoinflate while running...rumours are now saying that may have been the issue down on okeechobee...nothing confirmed yet."
1022892,Old Ironmaker,2018-02-14 20:25:00,8243,"I'm glad you have decided to pull the trigger Akrisoner. This is a good time to buy actually. Check around the Marine dealers for your boat. Many have taken in trade ins from the Boat Show. The owner at the building where we all work on our boats has a nice 16' tinny side council we worked on rainy days last Fall It was torn out to the skeleton  and rebuilt properly, new foam, new marine plywood, new carpeting, new paint, battery and 3 good seats plus other add ons like rod holders. I think it has a 50 or 60 Merc on it and a front electric troller. The engine has been gone over totally and has a clean bill of health. It will take 3 fisherpersons with comfort as long as they weren't former Offensive linemen. I was looking at it for myself actually if I decide to downsize from my 19' StarCraft. It's a Smoker Craft. You won't need a LOC to buy it either. It would be a great starter/fart around boat until you see what you actually want in the future. I will forego my finders fee which is usually a free lunch I end up paying for. PM me if interested and I'll put you in touch with them. Johnny D"
1022898,AKRISONER,2018-02-14 21:11:00,5558,"Cant say i disagree but at the end of the day when im really thinking about how i would be fishing this boat specifically, 99% of the time it would be mostly for bass fishing...thats the one beauty of a true bass boat is that they get somewhat devalued because of their lack of use for much else other than bass fishing. I would definitely never downrig or even do any open water fishing in it at all. No need for skiing or cruising either as we have boats to cover both of these things as well. Shallow hull, rod and gear storage and lots of deck space for standing up is the key...speed is also a big plus because im on georgian bay, travelling is part of the game. 17 foot bass boat with a 100-150hp looks really good thus far. As far as hitting big water, going out in really bad weather or multi species angling..thats when i would leave my boat at home and head out in the old man's boat. "
1022903,aplumma,2018-02-14 22:45:00,6896,Finally the old tiller VS console debate lol. I have a 1989 Ranger with the 150 0n it. It is a great boat for fishing and getting around from spot to spot quickly.  The 1989 GT 150 burns 8/10 of a gallon every minute with a 28 gallon tank doing 55 mph. With a few mods you can turn it into a GTX 150 and burn 9/10th gallon at 60 mph. I will say it needs to do 20 mph before it sets it nose and rides on the pad like it should. Wakes and waves are easily dealt with using common sense and goodspeed and trim adjustments. While looking at bass boats check the coring and structural carefully  recoring a bassboat is not cost effective and easily overlooked. The newer Rangers from 1990 did away with wood encapsulation and the pad was redesigned for more stability. The 1989 was the last year of the IMHO best pad for speed and tracking .  Art
1022910,Raf,2018-02-14 23:39:00,3495,"are you sure you want a glass boat fishing georgian bay (i'm assuming glass when you said bass boat)?  shallows/shoals at that?  one thing for a cruiser tied up to a dock, different story for a fishing boat IMO.   glass and granite don't mix well. even an aluminum, with the low draft found in a typical bass boat would not be my first choice when the rollers kick up.  a 'walleye' boat, different story."
1022935,BillM,2018-02-15 05:41:00,17367,A true bass boat out in GBay?  Eh..  Wouldn't be my first choice to be honest.
1022945,AKRISONER,2018-02-15 12:56:00,5558,"ive got a 19 foot alumacraft that i can use for the days that the bay isnt being friendly...id be fishing this boat much like i do my tinner. Ive also been fishing small tourneys in the kawarthas now, this boat would be 100% perfect for those days. Come the fall when things turn ugly and get cold im always out with my pops in his boat anyways. I am interested in some of the aluminum shallow hull side consoles..but selection is fairly limited...you cant beat the amount of casting room on a bass boat though."
1022974,JoshS,2018-02-15 16:36:00,729,"I was in the same boat as you (lol) years back when I was looking. If you can afford it, 100% go for it man! If you;re anything like me, the reward was far greater than the financial impact. Worth every penny.  It was a life changer for me. I wanted a rig forever, and the freedom of towing my own boat to where I want to fish was the greatest feeling. The times I've had in that boat and fish caught are priceless to me. I also thought long and hard about it. My finances were tight at the time albeit times were also a bit different back then being post recession and our dollar on par. I went down south and gotta deal. But it was still a bit of a stretch for me at the time and looking back, and I don't know what I was stressing over. Don't go over board (lol) on cost and get something comfortably in your range and you'll feel good about it. Go get a boat man and don't look back!"
1022987,aplumma,2018-02-15 20:20:00,6896,I would run a bass boat around granite before a deep V bottom it drafts less on and off plane. I use mine at lake Nipissing but to be fair I have been there 6 or 7 times. Now get me in open water and the V hulles win. I also have a jet boat aluminum boat and don't kid yourself they will pop a hole on rocks just like a fiberglass boat. They however are easier to repair and cheaper.  The ease of fishing a low side bass boat is worth it's weight in gold for me and after fishing both the  bass boat wins formy style of fishing.  Art
1022989,Old Ironmaker,2018-02-15 20:36:00,8243,A glass Walleye boat like the Stratos would kill 2 birds with 1 stone. Plenty of room for 3 to cast in the shallows and stable enough for bigger water. A quality boat can last you a lifetime if looked after.
1022993,AKRISONER,2018-02-15 21:03:00,5558,You and i seem to think alike...i also fish the same place all of the time...there were a few years where i smacked rocks lol...but now I know my lake pretty well.
1023010,Raf,2018-02-16 00:05:00,3495,what do you guys do when you need to go onshore to drop a deuce.. and you can't pull your glass boat up on the rocks?  or camping... and your beach is granite?
1023037,Lape0019,2018-02-16 14:31:00,647,Get to shore carefully and take care of business. lol. Glad to hear you're biting the bullet. It's definitely exciting to shop for boats. Downside to buying in December (for me) is not being able to use it for a few months. It's being stored at the dealer until I pick it up in May and this has been the longest 2.5 months ever!  
1023040,AKRISONER,2018-02-16 15:36:00,5558," its called the Cirillo Aqua Dump, my buddy mike perfected it...you hang off the ladder and let the trolling motor create a bidet"
1023044,grimsbylander,2018-02-16 17:14:00,3016,"Ok, I know it can happen to me easily as I get older but I'm confused A bassboat?? Last month you said: ""Not to spark up the debate about bass boats...but I have always said that those things are friggin stupid when fishing big open lakes. Id personally never buy one because how in the hell is a boat thats 1 foot off of the water ever going to stay afloat in a 6 foot chop."" Now I happen to know you're comment was based on a lack of knowledge about what happened on Big O and the fact you have no experience with then but why the sudden change of heart?"
1023046,AKRISONER,2018-02-16 17:53:00,5558,"I havent changed heart at all, id never fish a bass boat in big open lakes...Obviously that seems weird when I fish G bay...but Pointe Au Baril is a set back off of the main lake, and I never venture into the open section of the lake unless im in a 20+ foot boat...that lake can blow up way too big way too fast to even risk being caught. My understanding on okeechobee was that they were running at speed and basically darted headfirst into a roller with the nose of the boat and that was it. As ive said earlier in the thread, this would be my fishing ripping around boat that I can trailer to other lakes when need be. The old man has bigger boats for when the weather is ugly or you need to head to big water. A few years back i was heading out for laketrout with the old man in the 26 footer, it was absolute glass calm through the back channels, only to come out on the open lake into 10 foot rollers, friggin scary as hell. I swear the great lakes in 10 footers is wayyy scarier then the 20 foot rollers that I was in out off the north coast of haida gwaii a couple of years ago...totally different type of waves."
1023051,grimsbylander,2018-02-16 19:36:00,3016,"My advice to you is simple, I know you're not buying a boat anytime soon but investigate, talk to, ride in, whatever...the boat you think you want and just as importantly, boats you like but don't think can do the job. I'm not out to convince you of anything but I lived and fished GBay for 16 years and ran the gap many times in a bassboat, fished eastern Lake Ontario in a bassboat and now fish Erie in a bassboat; if you fish bass 99% of the time, you need to get an accurate view of the capabilities of a decent bassboat. Frankly, your assumptions are dead wrong. If I had to cross the gap in 6 footers I'd pick my Ranger all day. I'd get wet, but I'd get there safely. I can't tell you how many times I've driven past aluminum deep V's on Erie in the rough stuff. It's not a shot at deep V aluminums...they great boats, I get it. But if you think you're going to buy a bassboat that runs 55-65 MPH and NOT make runs out to the untouched waters at PAB, you kidding yourself. One thing these boats do GREAT is make big bodies of water really small. The first time I was ever in a bassboat was in Midland around 1989. We ran from the docks to Roberts Island east of Beausoleil in ~5 minutes. I was sold because previous to that, it was a journey to get there. Point Au Baril to the outer islands in under 12 mins?  unless to happen to smack the granite! LOL But the big advantage today are the graphs...go dead slow the first and lay down a trail...if you don't hit at 25mph, you're not going to hit with that boat up out of the water at 60."
1023053,AKRISONER,2018-02-16 19:50:00,5558,"how big is your boat grimsby?  I dont think i will be getting anything over an 18. added bonus is that Ive got a boat house that i can jack the boat up into in the winter for storage. If the right boat comes along, i could pull the trigger immediately...but it would have to be the right deal. So far ive found one boat in the province that fits the bill pretty nice. 18 foot 2002 skeeter with a 100 yammy 4 stroke that had the bottom half redone last year, under budget as well...big fan of yamaha outboards, might have to at least take a peak."
1023054,grimsbylander,2018-02-16 20:03:00,3016,"I was told 30 years when I wanted to buy my first boat to save my money and when I had enough to buy an 18"" boat with a 150... keep saving and get a 20' lol It was VERY good advice. The difference in price and the difference in ride, comfort and fishibility(yeah, that's a word lol) makes it a no brainer.  The disclaimer to this is if you know you're going to fish a small Haliburton lake 99% of the time...like a cottage owner for example. And in spite of the US exchange right now, shop the US! People just look at the exchange rate only but that's a mistake... it's a supply and demand market and the US has a $hi! ton of boats on the market."
1023055,AKRISONER,2018-02-16 20:34:00,5558,"I wish i could grab a 20 footer but its out of the question, i dont have anywhere to put it. gotta keep it small so that I have storage for it in the winter. If only our dollar was in the total crapper...need those oil prices to drive up again and make the dollar climb a bit. Definitely keeping an eye on the US market, not sure what it takes to get a boat back over the boarder legally?"

1023059,BillM,2018-02-16 20:50:00,17367,Us either.  Just walked in with the paper work and that was about it!
1023061,Old Ironmaker,2018-02-16 21:02:00,8243,"With all the proper paper work buying a boat south is a breeze. Make sure you know what is required on both sides first. I have brought back 5 cars over the years and a boat for a pal that can't cross. I was his eyes and ears. The difference of only 2 feet in a boat can be huge. I fished a few times in a 17' Lund, only 2 feet shorter than my StarCraft 190. To me it felt very crowded with just the 2 of us and no where near as stable in just 2 foot chop as mine, not close. I can get my deep V into water that a Bass boat will go with the electric. Mine is a deep V but doesn't have much of a draught, 18"" if not loaded down. The key is how much draught a boat has rather than the hull design. As far as making a 2 pile, that's what 5 gallon pails are for. Reduce pollution by way of dilution."
1023062,aplumma,2018-02-16 21:46:00,6896,Match the boat to the water and style you fish most of the time. I own 4 boats one is a 28ft twin 318's aluminum marinette that lives in the water and holds 8 people comfortably. One is a 18ft Ranger bassboat that trailers from lake to rivers in both Canada and USA. I have a jetdrive aluminum john boat 20ft for running shallow rivers and rapids. The final is a pontoon 10ft that fishes farm ponds and fits in a pickup bed. Each boat has a body of water that it spends 90% of its time on. No boat will fulfill all of your needs so pick the body of water you most often fish and get the boat that you like to fish from. Casting off of a deep V is not near as easy or enjoyable as a bassboat but trolling from a bass boat is not as easy and enjoyable as a deep V. . Down here there are few deep V fishing boats because we rarely troll for the species we have to fish for. I am in luck because we have stripers that come up river from the ocean so trolling is available and anchor fishing for 50 lb blue catfish makes owning a 28ft cruiser viable. You can usually hang around a boat ramp and ask people about how there boat fits into their lives and see how they set it up. I am sure that an offer to split costs and a great lunch might get you a day on the water with a new friend. Art
1022035,ch312,2018-01-29 17:07:00,1590,"There's a difference between financially responsible people and those who're absolutely clueless when it comes to managing money and credit. The former typically have this attitude because they're so good with money that financing a significant purchase is a non issue while the latter will max out their credit, stay in debt, and have no clue what they're doing. The OP is clearly in the first group as his latest post suggests he is doing well for someone his age and is more than capable of managing funds. AKRISONER, I don't think you're giving yourself as much credit as you deserve for being financially responsible. It's obvious you're on the right path and I don't think you realize how little of an impact financing $15k will have on your day to day life. Reward yourself for your hard work and enjoy life. $15k + $1.5k interest over say 3 years = $16.5k/1095 days is a whopping $15/day you need to scrounge up to afford this boat. Judging by the little information you've posted, you could easily afford this.  "
1022036,grimsbylander,2018-01-29 17:15:00,3016,"There you have it...apparently you can afford it, it's the best decision and there's no reason not to!! Enjoy!! lol"
1022039,BillM,2018-01-29 17:46:00,17367,"With the exchange rate right now, buying the US wouldn't be an option I'd consider.   However, we did purchase from Michigan when the exchange was a lot more favourable..   I could sell the boat now for what I paid 5 years ago."

1022055,moxie,2018-01-29 23:16:00,1566,Go do it ! But one caveat Get what you know will serve your needs for the long run. Be responsible but spend as much as you can afford to...... and then some. Don't leave room for regrets. Not everyone has 30 to 50k stuffed under their matress . Don't lose sleep over paynents either. You can wait a lifetime to scrimp and save and might eventually have enough to pay it outright but by then you might have to spend it on adult diapers or someone else will spend it for you on some sweet flowers and your casket instead and that ain't no fun. Live it while you can cause life has no guarantees .
1022101,BillM,2018-01-30 20:43:00,17367,Bingo.
1022105,AKRISONER,2018-01-30 21:32:00,5558,"this is fair...things i love most in life Family my dog my girlfriend fishing and being in the boat doing it....im out there 100+ days a year so i think I can justify the couple hundred bucks a month...especially now that ive spent the last 2 years really getting my gear to a level where I want it to be. Obviously rods can break etc...but for the most part im set up on that front now...I was probably spending that much gearing myself up anyways for the past two years. Gotta remember, you can always resell a decent boat so not all is lost if crap really does hit the fan. You might lose your equity in it, but thats a sunk cost anyways."
1022109,Chuck Enwinde,2018-01-31 12:13:00,247,I'd agree with this.  Two foot itis or a motor upgrade will cost you a lot more than interest payments.  Get the boat you want.
1022111,BassMan11,2018-01-31 13:49:00,583,"Sounds like your finances and in order and you can afford to have a little debt so go for it man. Another option is to use a line of credit to buy a boat ""cash"" and then you can create your own payment schedule.... depending on the rate obviously. This is what I did and it gives you the flexibility to either pay the minimum or pay as much as you want. Also depending on what boat (size and model) you are looking for, 15-20k can get you a Lund or an Alumacraft.. you just need to find the right deal. In my opinion dealers will always be at the higher end of the used boat market... you are probably better off to go with a private sale closer to the end of the year for your best value. My best advice..... CONSTANTLY be checking boat trader and Kijiji for boats. The good deals are gone within an hour of being posted. Good luck man... fun times"
1022466,ch312,2018-02-07 15:47:00,1590," You can use that HELOC ""cash"" to buy a cottage or for a down payment on another property too. A HELOC makes it possible for people to buy an investment property as these require 25% down and most people do not have that cash. Taking this route, you can sit back and let tenants pay off your debt for you. Or, setup a HELOC on the rental so the tenants are paying the mortgage on your rental AND paying for your toys. Using equity can open up a whole new world of awesome. If you're financially responsible, at least consider some of the options available out there that can make your life way more fun and provide financial freedom while using none of your own money.  Life is short, might as well enjoy it by using someone else's money to fund your happiness.... "

Some people must choose as to what is in their budget, simple as that. I have known some guys, and gals, that smoke a pack or more a day each, down a 24 a day and a few bottles a week between them. They usually don't own a boat or can tell the front from the back of it on a good day, sad really ."
1022536,boombap,2018-02-08 21:24:00,310,Lmao! From what he posted he seems to be financially stable.. so yeah buy the boat dude whos cares.
1022565,ch312,2018-02-09 17:26:00,1590," This is why discussions about finances and credit are usually so interesting. You have the people who've been making good money all their lives, but they're not capable of managing money or have horrible credit so they cannot fathom a financially responsible individual financing something. Then you have the folks who make little money and have maxed out their credit at high rates and cannot escape the predicament they've put themselves in so they tell others to never use credit. Then you have those who're financially responsible with great credit that do what they want because financing is so cheap and a few extra dollars per month is a non issue.  This thread has inspired me to go shopping for a new ATV that I plan on financing instead of using cash. The cost to finance? Less than $275 over two years. If they deny my financing I'll use the HELOC and it'll cost $580 in interest. $11.45 ($0.38/day) vs $24 ($0.80/day) per month in interest fees. Pennies and meaningless either way. I'm almost tempted to finance the OP's boat and charge him a few points just to make sure he buys it!   Has anyone been part of private lending? I've been considering it for a while now, just not sure where to start. "
1022603,pics,2018-02-10 01:28:00,1268,Go for it.. Just never ever take the bank up on their offer to roll the line of credit into the mortgage.. That's when you really pay!!

1022610,Old Ironmaker,2018-02-10 04:15:00,8243,"If there are do overs in life I would have financed a boat after I got divorced in 89' and didn't wait until for almost 20 years, long years. I shopped around and knowing nothing about boats then I almost bought a 19' Bayliner cuddy with the ""L"" Force outboard, no internet with a bevy of knowledge to research then. It was a sexy looking boat and I was in the mood for that then. Actually I had the cash after I bought a condo but lost the boat cash it to a few bad legit deals so stopped shopping. So after that I was shy to finance, I could have afforded a payment. I did finance a Benz 560 SEC a few years latter that was my toy that I found in Florida that I sold 10 years latter for what I paid for it not including interest. Knowing what I know now I am glad I waited otherwise I may not have ever bought another boat when it fell apart. Those Force OB's didn't last 3 years. I didn't have to wait that 20 years though. Go for it man. Now because of my health it looks like I will be selling my baby this spring. You know what the best 2 days in a boaters life, I call Bull, I will be sad seeing her hooked up on another guys truck. You seem to be a level headed individual and can well afford a payment. No do overs in life. Go buy your boat. Not a 80's or early 90's Bayliner though."
1022636,JTube,2018-02-10 22:14:00,2,"My 2cents from another old guy... in addition to financial...think long & hard about where &how you plan to use the boat. Seen many guys buy more boat then they need or before they knew what they really wanted & regret it. There's no such thing as a perfect all-around boat. Fibreglass & Wide beams mean more weight and more weight means bigger more pricey outboard needed but is really nice to have on big water. Beware of under=powered package deals (popular with Legend & others). You will have as good a time fishing in any well running craft with features you like customized to your liking as you will in a $90,000 fancy rig that put you in the poor house. The main thing is to get out there!"
1022663,Old Ironmaker,2018-02-11 17:53:00,8243,"That is not a boat, 1 step above a pool toy! Just because you catch more fish than 10 of us put together, or more, doesn't mean you catch them from a boat. If it doesn't cost you at least $100.00 per outing it ain't a boat!"
1022664,misfish,2018-02-11 18:02:00,29133,More money for tackle and BEER
1022666,Old Ironmaker,2018-02-11 18:22:00,8243,"Aren't you supposed to be out fishin' Dude? I woke up with a strained Achilles Tendon. I shoveled at least 15 feet of walkway yesterday.  My body sucks, 15 feet a shovel width, guys used to want to be me, now I don't want to be me. I can't even take out the garbage and recycle today, that's a useless body. I dare not ask my wife after she's been out working for 10 hours on a Sunday. That's not fair. Maybe I'll ask the 87 year old lady next door. My point is that you are supposed to fish for the both of us."
1022668,misfish,2018-02-11 18:37:00,29133,"Fished from 6 am til noon today. I live here. Do not need to spend all day out there. LOL  Moving about by foot is a be atch here right now, so one move is alot of work. Sorry for the hi jack AK  Good luck with the new boat."
1022675,Old Ironmaker,2018-02-12 00:24:00,8243,He is used to it by now. You are bragging now Brian. I was feeling so good yesterday I told Tich I might try and walk a few hundred yards today. Maybe with a cane.
1022858,AKRISONER,2018-02-14 15:03:00,5558,"no problem on the hijack lol most threads that get enough replies always go off topic.  For consideration is that this is definitely going to be a ""starter boat/fart around boat"" of sorts for me. The problem is that my current set up just doesnt fish 3 guys at all...you can do it but its just not really reasonable. Thats the main driver here, I want to be able to fish 3 guys   My pops actually bought the boat of my dreams last fall and at 65 years old im sure once he gets on in his years he will not have any problem with me using it a bit more frequently. The issue is that as it currently stands I dont have the freedom to take that boat where I want or when i want.  I think the concensus here and the logic about getting a HELOC might be the way to go when im ready to pull the trigger...I dont see myself purchasing in the spring when the prices are favorable to the seller...might wait until people are thinking about having to store their boats next fall.  shopping around is fun...what i have seen so far looks promising!"
1022888,Sinker,2018-02-14 18:40:00,8692,"I think the most versatile boat is a 16ft tiller. You can fish 3 no problem, with a lot more room than a lot of much bigger console boats. You can handle some big water, and easily launch into smaller back lakes. You don't even notice it behind the truck towing, and fuel is next to nothing. Simple and effective. I've had the same boat since '93, and I catch as many fish as any other fancy boat, I will guarantee that. I've had tons of people ask my if my boat is an 18 footer too....they look at it and say, wow, that's a big boat.....but its not really. Just deep and wide, and tons of floor space to move around. That's my opinion anyways, I've been in and fished from all kinds of boats, and I like fishing from a wide open tiller the best.  S."
1022889,BillM,2018-02-14 19:00:00,17367,"Tillers are great, but getting out of the weather in them can be tough.   If you're doing a lot of crappy weather fishing, you might want something with a full console that will accept a custom stand up top. But as far as making use of the space you've got, big tiller hands down.  Easily room for 3 guys or more.    I think it really depends on the type of fishing you do, that should dictate the boat you'll wanna go with."
1021873,AKRISONER,2018-01-26 15:32:00,5558,"Hey Guys, As i approach 30 years old, ive been considering the fact that for the amount that fish, it wouldnt be too far fetched of an idea for me to finally go out on a limb and purchase a starter boat for myself to upgrade from my tinner. Basically my idea would be to get a used bass boat/v haul with livewells, a starting battery etc etc. Of course I would love to simply go out and purchase a boat private sale, but I dont really have 15k sitting around. A bank loan would be an option pending how high interest rates are from a boat dealer? Aside from my mortgage I am finance/debt free. The idea of a monthly payment for a boat is starting to seem like a reasonable idea. My question relates to financing a used/new boat. You see a ton of ads for cars and what their purchase finance rates are, but ive been trying to research what financing on a boat looks like and the lack of information is astonishing. My question for you folks is what is the standard purchase finance rate for a new/used boat, what rate was available when you bought your boat? I checked out Nitro's finance calculator, but it applied a base finance rate of 15%...surely that cant be accurate, can it? that seems insane. Any info that you guys can provide would be awesome.  Thanks,"
1021874,BillM,2018-01-26 16:00:00,17367,You'll probably be better off with a HELOC and purchasing the boat in cash.   You won't find a lower rate I'd bet.
1021875,Lape0019,2018-01-26 16:02:00,647,"Akrisoner, I just went through this myself. Best bet is to go talk to a dealer that has a boat you are looking at and see what they can offer you. The amount varies from marina to marina but your credit score plays a large factor as well (obvious... I know). I was quoted anywhere between 3.98 to 9%. This was even before anyone looked at my credit score. It was based on market rates, the type of people that typically walk through their doors and of course, the boat I was looking at (new vs used). If you want to discuss this more, feel free to PM me. "
1021876,Musky Plug,2018-01-26 16:12:00,398,"I am in the same boat as you, so to speak when it comes to looking for a new boat. I'm pretty positive that the rates are higher compared to buying a vehicle. I was at the boat show last weekend and was in both the Lund and Alumacraft booths, and looking a couple different boats. For that we were looking at the monthly payments were much higher then I pay for my new truck, which blew my mind. So I have decided to go the used route for now. If you are considering new, shop around at different marinas and find one that will give you the best deal for what you want. "
1021878,grimsbylander,2018-01-26 16:41:00,3016,"If you are currently saving and investing 10% of your gross income without fail and you still have extra money to cover a boat payment plus the extras(increased insurance, etc) then go for it. If not, consider this...that $15k boat will cost you about $19k at 8% over the term of the loan. If you start putting the $250 month away now, in 5 years at 6% you'll have $17.5K cash. My opinion? Don't borrow money for toys unless everything else, including your mortgage, is paid for and it's above and beyond a savings schedule."
1021890,AKRISONER,2018-01-26 19:06:00,5558,"3% seems a lot better than 15...but holy cow the difference between 3 and 9 is insane? I cant even get close to even considering a lund or alumacraft...seems like only a 60+ year old executive can afford those things these days...insane how much they are asking for them...even crazier is that they somehow cost 50% less about 15 years ago. Aside from my mortgage payment Im close...hence why im starting to look...and thats the one thing that kinda bothers me is that Im not a huge believer of financing toys...but in this day and age of any boat basically costing at least 20k, how can one expect to ever buy one unless you make 500k a year+ I mean in all honesty, who is mortgage free at 30 years old? Is the expectation not to have a boat until you dont have a mortgage...thats a tough pill to swallow! I havent even looked at the potential of getting a HELOC loan...how do they place a value on the price of your home anyways? i.e. my home is going to cost about 50% less its in orangeville for example. I live in the city of Toronto so everything is ridiculously inflated.  "
1021891,Old Ironmaker,2018-01-26 19:07:00,8243,"^^^^^^^^This. Otherwise a home equity line of credit is your best rate, new boat or used."
1021894,gordy28,2018-01-26 19:28:00,638,If you got through your bank typically they will charge you between $500 and $900 for an appraisal that determines your home value Many banks will have an offer in place whereby if you take $X loan they will waive the appraisal cost To get a sense of rates in your area - use ratehub.ca or other comparison tools I have found that having a sense of the market before going to your own bank is the best way to negotiate  - have a sense of whats out there Good luck Gordy
1021895,BillM,2018-01-26 19:29:00,17367,"The bank will do an assessment of the house (Usually a driveby) when processing your HELOC.     My appraisal and legal fees were $400 with TD which were waived if I withdrew the entire amount for at least 3 months.  If you're only looking at 15-20k, then that's an easy choice (You're interested over those months will never add up to that much) Do not let a boat dealer stick you with a high finance rate, they're such a rip off."
1021903,boombap,2018-01-26 21:37:00,310,Went through the same thing a couple of years ago.. wanted a new boat but the prices are just insane. I went with a used boat at 7%.. got a small payment and yeah I'm paying interest on it but it's still about 1/4 of what I would have spent renting a boat 3x a month. You got a mortgage though.. so do yourself the favor and put that boat under your mortgage.. why the hell not? A $15k-$20k boat will barely put a dent in your mortgage payment. That's just me.. life is short man.
1021912,ch312,2018-01-27 05:03:00,1590,"You own a house, put that equity to work for you. You can get a HELOC up to 80% of your homes current value at low rates. It basically turns your house into a big fat credit card and you only need to pay the interest each month. For a $20,000 boat you'd likely be looking at minimum payments of $50-60 a month. Doing it this way you have the flexibility of paying whatever you want per month as long as it's above the minimum. As you pay down the debt your available credit goes back up like a credit card. Lose your job? Oh well, just make the minimum payments for a couple months til you're back on your feet. Extra cash? Pay off the HELOC with no penalty. It's a no stress, low interest loan that's great for people who can manage money. If you have a very good credit score be sure to haggle and grind the bank until you get what you want. "
1021916,dave524,2018-01-27 13:55:00,4508,"I was single with a good paying steel mill job and I didn't buy a fancy boat till I was 32 and had  cash,  do what you want but  I don't see this as a good idea but then there is a 40 years age difference."
1021942,ch312,2018-01-27 19:47:00,1590,"Times have changed. If everyone waited until they had enough cash saved up to buy toys, not many people would have toys as living has become so expensive. In the OP's case, $15k at 4% over 4 years = $340/month with $1250 in interest over those 4 years. That's only $300 and change extra per year to have a boat now instead of 4 years down the road. The OP's only choice is to use credit and the HELOC is likely his best option. It's silly to miss out on the amount of fun a boat provides and limit yourself to shore or friends boats just to save a few peanuts."
1021944,Tom S,2018-01-27 19:56:00,362,"They sure have. And for the sake of people with attitudes like yours I hope the interest rate stays down, otherwise there is going to be a whole lot of trouble. Nothing wrong with carrying some debt, pretty much everyone needs to these days. But there are way to many people living beyond their means who could be in for a heap of trouble. Just make sure that you're covered in the event of a bad situation (car repairs, house repairs, loss of job, sickness) before you start borrowing towards some big boy toys."
1021945,BillM,2018-01-27 19:58:00,17367,"Absolutely, but if you're going to buy one anyhow, there's no reason to pay the high finance rate he'll be offered through the dealer.    Use your equity, get a low rate, enjoy the boat."
1021953,captpierre,2018-01-27 22:29:00,2521,"Did anybody mention that HELOC can be unsecured or secured? The rates are much better to have one secured by your  home. But to get one will cost you an appraisal. Might be $4-600. If you have other business with the same bank like RRSP, credit cards and checking account you are a valued customer and can negotiate fees and interest rates. Provided you have been wise with your debt and made regular payments.   Just know the banks are nervous about the ridiculous real estate prices if you have a big mortgage. Say over 70% of the property value. If you can’t pay they get your house and have to sell it. Maybe after a housing correction. and take a bath.   Buy a quality used boat, take a test drive and have a tech look at the engine. If it hits  the fan you can always sell it. A used good boat won’t deprecated much if you look after it.  Don’t forget the cost of boat ownership  Fuel, maintenance, insurance, tow vehicle, storage and foot itis.  Be patient  watch the market and pull the trigger when the right boat comes up.  Hard to do Just sayin. "
1021955,LostAnotherOne,2018-01-27 23:29:00,956,Your wise to post this topic on this board.  I did it a few years ago before purchasing my first boat.  Most guys on here are older then us so there knowledge can benefit you greatly.  Good luck with your purchase.

I bust my butt at work so I can enjoy my life. I spend my money on things that make my life more fun. I have never regretted buying any of my toys. Never. S.
1021978,ch312,2018-01-28 19:48:00,1590, Attitude like mine? Heh...if you only knew who you were talking too.... You guys are talking like the OP is putting his life on the line to buy a million dollar boat that he can never sell if times are tough and it's absolutely ridiculous. If times are tough he has the option of making interest payments only or selling the boat.   *DING*DING*DING* We have a winner! 
1021987,Canuck,2018-01-28 22:45:00,491,"You are right to have a rule of not borrowing for toys.  But if you have enough equity in your home, you don't outspend what you can afford, and get a decent rate, then go for it.  Also, a home equity line of credit is good to have as a backup if you ever really need to come up with cash in an emergency.  Most of them do not have a stand-by charge, so you should get a limit that is higher than you need (but don't use it all). No matter what, pay the boat loan off as quickly as you can.  Stand by your rule of not paying for toys on credit by getting out of the credit ASAP. If you stay out of high interest debt, and are patient, the boat you will own when you are 40 will be a lot nicer than the one you will be able to afford at 40 if you rack up a lot of ""toy"" debt now.  (unless you have a career that ensures you will be making a lot more money in 10 years) No disrespect to those that say ""you only live once"", but a balanced approach will serve you better in the long run IMO."

1022011,AKRISONER,2018-01-29 12:39:00,5558,"holy heck, wasnt around for the weekend and this thread took off... to give you guys way too much info about my life lol just to show you my situation and give you a better profile of myself. My mortgage is for 60% of the value of my home, my home was built last year...anything breaks, thats the responsibility of the condo corp...one thing i should be wary of is increased condo fees. (worth noting) I own a truck with 40,000click on it that is fully paid off, however it is a dodge...which has had to go into the shop for warranty work 3 times now lol so good heads up on this one. 5% of my income goes to retirement, which my company matches as our retirement savings plan. dont smoke, dont smoke the herb either, barely drink aside from a very casual beer. No credit card debt or any other debt/payments owed. Would be looking for a starter boat, definitely not trying to shop for anything probably over 17 feet, but would want my money spent on getting a powerplant that can get 3 guys around easily...so probably over 100hp so that jacks up the price a bit. I guess one way to protect myself from any major hit is to ensure that i get a good deal buying used...that way if something really did hit the fan, im not taking a major hit on the used vs new depreciation...i.e. you can go buy a 30k boat brand new...something happens and you have to sell a boat with 3hours on it for 20k...or you buy a used boat with 30 hours on it, for 20k, and then sell it for 18k with 50 hours on it.  Anyone here have experience buying boats from the states? What are the rules about that? I know that right of the top, that buying a used bass boat from the states is going to get me wayyyy more bang for my buck than up here...or at least thats what ive seen shopping around online and heard from some members here...what about the taxes/will the bank still give you that loan for whatever you want even if you are purchasing something from the USA?
