1024297,boombap,2018-03-11 00:41:00,310,Anyone running these to power their trolling motor? Currently running a group 27 to power my 50# powerdrive.. looking to get a bit more time on each charge. Space is tight to fit 2 group 27's and not looking to step down to 24's. Looking at most golf cart batteries and they're rated for 200+ah so will give me more than 2 27's would. Just looking for opinions/ideas. Thanks.
1024298,Canuck,2018-03-11 00:51:00,491,I have a pair of them for the house bank on my boat.  They are not small or light.  They are 65lbs each. I think they are 230 AmpHr.  Wired in series to get 12v you don't add the capacity. It's 230 total at 12v.  If you needed 24v you would need 4 batteries and you would have 230 at 24v. (And 280lbs). They do work well though and can draw way down and charge back up.
1024300,boombap,2018-03-11 00:55:00,310,"True, wasn't thinking about the total ah. Still.. 2 golf cart batteries vs. a group 31 (which I can fit) would give me more ah, yeah?"

I have learned here on OFC that the marine batteries have thicker cell walls and are much more resistant to shock. A boat battery can be used in a car or truck but not vice versa. Off roaders use the more robust marine batteries I believe."
