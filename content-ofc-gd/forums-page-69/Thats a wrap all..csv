I made it out every weekend and the odd night after work.  Cant wait til 2019 hard water season. Then again, there is lots of ice and cold temps still. So guess I,ll go yella belly searching.  "

1024571,ketchenany,2018-03-15 23:32:00,3229,"We have to follow the “boys” they can be a bit elusive most of the time. Notice B goes to Tims and never see Terry! Who knows where Terry goes, BUT they alway meet at the same spot! Following them is like hunting. Undercover he wears orange you wear black and NEVER park at a right angle. Rizzo, they can be ‘bought’ find some Bravo tomatoe sauce and you are in!  "
1024578,Old Ironmaker,2018-03-16 02:35:00,8243,"The fish have been waiting for mid night since New Years. They are safe from the ""Grim Tooner"" for a few months. Walleye is open here all year Grim Tooner. I will be your safety boat. Now a Lake Erie Toon fishing video on a nice calm day (20 naughts) would be something more than 5 minutes I'd watch all the way through to the end."
1024583,AKRISONER,2018-03-16 11:38:00,5558,"the crappies are starting to bite, and weve got 3 friggin feet of ice and counting...brrr its cold this morning, when is ice off? may?  Enjoy the river fishing!"
1024586,Fish Farmer,2018-03-16 14:24:00,2234,"Brian you cease to amaze me with your videos, great watch buddy and choice of music. Never did make it up but have been talking to a few buds doing the soft water Whitie jig thing later on."
