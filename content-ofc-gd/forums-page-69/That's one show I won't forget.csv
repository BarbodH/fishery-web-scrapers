Saw some folks, sold some goods an put on some pounds by show's end.  As we are packing up at day's end, the son drops a display board square across my toes.  Despite wanting to curse and swear, I had to bite my tongue. The grandkids were standing right there.  Finish packing, haul the goods home, then spend 5 hours in Emerg to tell me the obvious. I have a broken toe, and they can't do anything til next morning. Wait another two hours this morning to get fitted for a boot. Guess I can have some down time at home."

I broke my big toe walking in the water fishing on a Friday AM, couldn't do a thing all weekend, of course the first time I could put on a boot was Monday and I limped into the plant at 7PM. . You should have twittled or airmailed me, I could have saved you 5 hours sitting in the Emerg. You are going to live Bruce"
1024378,bigugli,2018-03-12 16:58:00,6138,I'll live alright. Just don't need the down time at this time of year.

1024387,crappieperchhunter,2018-03-12 17:45:00,2582,Sorry to hear Bruce. Hopefully your recovery is quick and it doesn't interfere with spring planting too much.
1024396,Old Ironmaker,2018-03-12 20:26:00,8243,Before you know it you will be back on your tippy toes. Tape your big toe to your next (index?) toe. That's what they did when playing ball and you got turf toe. That hurt worse than a broken toe. It is a dislocated big toe.
