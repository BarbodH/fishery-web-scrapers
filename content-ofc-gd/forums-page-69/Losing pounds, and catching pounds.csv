1024341,misfish,2018-03-11 20:15:00,29133,Both him and I have the same back pain. LOL

1024345,fishingwithbob,2018-03-11 21:33:00,123,Those fish handlers at zehrs should be more careful
1024350,Moosebunk,2018-03-11 22:53:00,3970,Man Bri... I get so bloody winded just pulling the little Clam around with the gear. It is great exercise and with the total perk of catching fish inbetween workouts.
1024359,PUMP KNOWS,2018-03-12 03:38:00,937,Good stuff
1024366,DJGeneral,2018-03-12 14:06:00,163,I gotta lose some pounds maybe i can pull the smitty for yah?
1024369,ketchenany,2018-03-12 15:02:00,3229,"Brian, it's about time you get a Smittoo."
1024372,Old Ironmaker,2018-03-12 15:34:00,8243,"Exercise to loose weight is highly over rated. Get the Dr. to prescribe Jardiance (a Type 2 Diabetes med.) I have lost 35  pounds since taking it 15 months ago and have fought to gain back 7 lbs of it.  Loss of 10 to 15lbs is normal. My arse hurts when I sit on a wooden chair. They checked me for Bile Duct Cancer, but thankfully 6 months and a gallon of blood, some sleepless nights and multiple MRI's later etc. All results negative. I told my Diabetes Doc if they could isolate the thing in Jardiance that results in weight loss I would invest and make some real coin. She said they already have and a weeks supply is $800.00 USD. POTUS can afford that."
