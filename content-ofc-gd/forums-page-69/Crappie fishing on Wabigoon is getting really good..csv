Was going to go further afield but could not be bothered and decided to stay local, was going to make a 45 minute skidoo ride up the lake but that even seemed like a chore, ended up stopping at a spot 10 minutes from the house. This spot had been good a couple of years back but seemed to slack right off last year. However, I did venture there in the fall in my boat and found crappie in the deep holes and figured I should try again on the ice. The bite was intermittent but got a limit(15) in a couple of hours which was a nice result so close to home.  "
