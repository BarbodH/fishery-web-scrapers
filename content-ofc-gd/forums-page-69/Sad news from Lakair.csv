Thanks for all of your kind words. Miss my dad lots and lots still, but it's nice thinking about how in life he had so many friends and that there so many people that thought so highly of him. I've been living out in BC for a few years now but make the trip back to the lake as often as I can. Hoping to make it out again this summer... Anyway, thanks again and best of luck on all of your fishing adventures!"

I am grateful for the time I was able to spend with him over the years.  He was a friendly, welcoming, kind and generous guy but also very entertaining in so many ways.  Cheers Kevin!"
908462,Rizzo,2015-04-07 00:43:00,4754,"Well that's very sad news. Kevin was always kind to me when I was there. I remember one year during the pike derby just watching him trolling in south muskrat bay...he had a real defined route that he just stuck to, kind of a big oval that he followed around and around and around. I think it paid off for him though! Can still picture him walking through the camp with his dog just tidying things up."

909193,Regan Thompson,2015-04-10 02:24:00,80,I have and still do have a great deal of respect for Kevin.  He was a stand-up guy and a true pioneer of the lodge business in many ways. He had a rare magnetic quality about himself that I'd never encountered before.  In the short time I knew him he taught me a lot.  I'll miss the talks we had.  Rest in Peace Kevin
909221,wormdunker,2015-04-10 10:14:00,1711,Although I never met Kevin he must have been a gem.  I get this impression from the OFC members that have stayed at his lodge & posted about many happy trips to his resort.  Rest in peace my friend.

908207,Steve,2015-04-05 16:25:00,2075,"I'm very sorry to hear about this.  My trip to Lakair was in 2004.  I just bought my new to me 17' boat. I was used to a canoe.  My first real trip in the boat was at Lakair.  Kevin walked me through my entire boat, what to keep an eye out for, what to maintain. Then of course he went over a basic map to let me know where all the rocks were....  So out I go, get stuck on a rock, directly in front of camp. Kevin was on shore smiling and laughing.  I'll always remember that  RIP kind Sir."
