1024250,Old Ironmaker,2018-03-09 03:15:00,8243,Yes I agree. Don't lip that fish Canuck! I am amazed at the quality of video we can get now for a few hundred bucks. Not that long ago a film crew and a Chopper would cost many thou to capture what your buddy got there. My kudos to him Dave.
1024252,grimsbylander,2018-03-09 03:29:00,3016,"Man, why did he punch the throttle? He just about killed the woman! Amazing footage though!!"
1024253,DRIFTER_016,2018-03-09 03:43:00,10439,"He was trying to pull the tarpon away from the bull shark. Cindy's a pretty tough chick. Notice how my buddy completely ignored her to get the shot? 10:1 she was on her back yelling ""Did you get the shot Sam?"""
1024255,grimsbylander,2018-03-09 12:33:00,3016,"^^^ LOL!! Incredible footage....and crazy HD. The thing that really impressive to me was, you can even see the clouds of blood in the water."
1024259,LeXXington,2018-03-09 14:48:00,1928,cool
1024272,Rizzo,2018-03-09 23:18:00,4754,so what ends up happening?
1024276,DRIFTER_016,2018-03-10 01:46:00,10439,Tarpon becomes bull shark lunch and Sam and Cindy go back to fishing.
1024321,lunkerbasshunter,2018-03-11 13:53:00,2585,awesome video qty
1024333,Rizzo,2018-03-11 16:17:00,4754,luckily she fell into boat and not out of it or Cindy would have been bull shark lunch!
