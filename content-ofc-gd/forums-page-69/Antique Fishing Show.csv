Get there early or be 6 deep at the tables. I find things are picked over by 1PM but you still can get some great deals at the end of the show as guys don't really want to lug stuff back home and they have time to talk to you then. Last year I thought we got there early but HTHM was already walking to the parking lot with some rods in hand. Many of our guys are there every year."
