You could email Andy Pallotta - [email protected] - Bassmania All Basmania says : . All boats must carry a minimum of $1,000,000.00 insurance liability. Proof of insurance must be made available upon request"
1024217,hirk,2018-03-08 16:29:00,571,I found several surveyors that would do my 20' for $200. Might sway you if your still on the fence getting coverage
1024088,cisco,2018-03-06 21:57:00,597,"Liability isn't just to protect you re running over swimmers. Eg. a short circuit fire due to a water/gas logged hull burns the cottage or marina down the boat is parked beside. True story... Years ago a pal brought his fairly new bass boat to our cottage and went over a fair bump in the dirt roadway. He got out right away and he looked all worried as he examined the keel area close to the transom. Later he decided to not take his boat out... ""too windy"" I recall him saying. It even had a transom saver. In a month or two he sold the boat and the new owner, a guy we knew drove out onto a lake and as he was getting some tackle out the boat sank... within a couple minutes! They somehow worked a deal so it got covered by insurance.   I'm guessing the claim was from which of them had insurance for hitting something in the water. I do not trust fibreglass boat sellers as result. Invite the old owner for the first test drive. Tell him it's so he can show you how everything works. If he declines or looks nervous behind the wheel and won't hit waves, get a  marine survey done. The only way to buy a used fibreglass boat is with a M.S. and a high speed wave hitting test ride in it while watching the owner to see any nervousness. Then I'd check the bilge for any water/oil/gas."
1024113,AKRISONER,2018-03-07 14:01:00,5558,"Thanks for the input guys, im still contemplating but im heavily leaning towards not insuring the boat...I already know that my deductible would be $1,000 and the blue book value is just under $3,000...my premium for the year is going to be over $400 and then id have to spend over $500 just to get the marine survey done...so basically just to get insurance to cover anything id be paying $2,000 of the $3,000 that the insurance company would give me should the boat sink...just doesnt seem like a good investment at this point. if i squeeze two years out of the boat without crashing it...voila im in the green.  A co-worker of mine that sails said that theres a possibility that my house insurance would cover some of my personal liability...which is really what i was trying to insure against anyways....I really dont give a damn about the boat at this point."

1024154,Lape0019,2018-03-07 20:28:00,647,"Downside of insuring under house policy is that if you have a claim on your boat, your home insurance goes up. I was insured that way for years and never had an issue but this was always on my mind."

1024157,Old Ironmaker,2018-03-07 21:02:00,8243,"I wouldn't insure it either. For 400 bucks a year I get 14K loss and a million in liability through my homeowners. With my life experiences I have heard a number of horror stories about people I know that either weren't insured or thought they were. The story was 30 years ago my parents neighbour had friends over to shingle a story and 1/2 house. A young kid fell, ended up in a chair for life, paraplegic. The insurance paid out 1 million, the family had to liquidate everything they owed including their home and this guys going to pay 30% of his wages and his EX wife will do the same for the rest of their lives. The kid was 16 and the homeowners were in their mid 20's then. 2 families devastated for life to save what? A few bucks in qualified labour? And they had insurance. Tragic story. I would want to have some liability insurance at the least on my boat. Accidents happen and I wouldn't want to risk any equity in my home. Today I don't think court will award a plaintiff everything a family has. I hope not."
1024161,cisco,2018-03-07 21:51:00,597,I wouldn't insure it. Just be careful where it is parked n relation to expensive stuff. As for tourneys you can still fish beside them unofficially. Odds are you are like most entrants so wouldn't have won anything anyway but would have spent a ton on entry fees.
1024162,grimsbylander,2018-03-07 22:05:00,3016,LOL I don't think that's the real spirit of competing. I play hockey in the driveway while the Leafs on! haha

My only stipulation was speed. The boat could not exceed 60mph or it would be need to be on its own policy. Different insurance companies will have different rules though."

Much more than a survey I bet.  I'm sure there will be a day liability on all vehicles off road and on water will be mandatory.

1024191,Old Ironmaker,2018-03-08 04:35:00,8243,"Some real answers from an Insurance person. I know I have things covered besides the basic loss from the home policy. Like some jewelry beyond the basic loss where we needed photos and appraisals that were required. Ticha's ring, a few Championship rings and my Nono's and Dad's antique watches and Military Medals,  Ticha's Grandmothers and Mom's stuff. No need for anyone to come snoop here it's all in a safety deposit box. Feel free to take my Walmart 20 buck fashion watches right next to my Pit Bulls food bowl. Talking about insurance my broker who I fished with out here a few times told me to take pics of all my tackle, electronics, boat accessories and rods and keep them on a disc outside the home in case of fire. Heck 3 fenders, an anchor and 200' feet of quality rope, a marine fire extinguisher, a booster pack, a simple GPS combo and 2 more sonars, a good compass, 2 inflatables, 2 good quality PDF's, a simple tool kit, Maui Joe glasses, a good safety/first aid kit, a blood glucose tester,  a spare prop, a Smart phone.  I'll stop there and that is close to or more than $2500.00 plus HST to replace. 2/3 the cost of Akri's boat. I venture a guess once all that stuff is aboard a $3000.00 boat is closer to 6 grand than 3 grand not including the weapons of mass destruction. Another grand maybe, more? $500.00 bucks for a survey may be a good financial move  after all Akrisoner. I forgot the CD of ""Oh Brother Are Out Thou?"" By The Soggy Bottom Boys, priceless."

Are you checking with the insurance companies or going through a broker? If you aren't going through a broker go to one. They deal with many different companies and will get you the best deal and work through any red tape.
1024030,cisco,2018-03-06 11:03:00,597,"""didnt need the survey for ""soundness"" of the boat, its all fibreglass no marks and the engine runs...what more could I want?"" It's not what you want. It's what the insurance company wants. Fibreglass can fool you. The survey is for valuation and risk assessment. If the survey finds the fibreglass hull has been compromised by water, gas, holding tank leakage then this affects the value and also points to liability issues which raises rates or prevents coverage. If gasoline has gotten into the hull would you want to insure it? If water has rotted out the transom under the fibreglass would you want to insure it? The aft part where the motor mounts are may be rotten/rusted/broken inside. Big engines need solid structure. Surveyor  can help find such stuff to help the insurer know what they're insuring. BTW I don't mean to piss you off.  There are many entrances into the fibreglass hull where delamination or seepage can occur. "

1024036,Old Ironmaker,2018-03-06 12:02:00,8243,Insure it through your Home Owners policy or find a new broker and make sure you tell them you are shopping for a new provider. A required survey for a small Skeeter is ridiculous.
1024037,AKRISONER,2018-03-06 12:41:00,5558,"Lesson learned....I apologize to everyone here, never read about how insurance companies are trying to take you and then post right before bed. You become a total bumhole and then sound like one when you post.  You are totally right cisco, the time to get a marine survey is before you buy the boat. But for the price i paid, theres definitely gonna be some inhereted risk associated with buying a 20 year old boat. I already know that there was one fibreglass repair done to it...the seller was 100% forthcoming, the repair was done close to 6 years ago when he had no intention of selling it. At that time the owner had every intention of continuing to use the boat so he had it professionally repaired and spent a lot of money doing so. He showed me the job the guy did from the inside out and you literally could basically not tell from the inside that it had been repaired aside from colouration and from the outside it was spotless and impossible to see. The owner even provided me with the receipt for the repair because the shop that did it guaranteed it for life. What im looking at now is that I could go get this marine survey done, and they could basically say the boat is uninsurable, and now ive literally thrown away the cost of getting the survey when Im contemplating not insuring the boat at all now anyways. Like hypothetically they say that it shouldnt be insured...and sure enough im back at square one unable to get insurance and out $500 This is how these guys get you, you cant get Liability insurance...you have to buy the complete package for a boat thats blue book is only $3000 thats with a $1000 deductible...so basically i would never claim against the insurance anyways If the boat is totally shot...im out the money i paid for the boat...im using my own judgement and inspection of the boat and taking on that risk. In my opinion I should be afforded that freedom and provided the opportunity to purchase liability insurance that would basically have nothing to do with the mechanical functionality of the boat. I get it, if the boat friggin sinks instantly and all of my friends are in it and we all drown...theres a problem, but like a few pictures of the boat would solve that?  Sorry to rant...Cisco if the boat was 30+ thousand I would be 100% on board to get the survey done before hand, but for insurance purposes when all i want coverage for is if someone goes swimming at night in the middle of the lake and I somehow dont see them...I guess i better reverse and make sure they get chopped up entirely at this point ahaha. Great advice though!   I tried that Iron, they will only do up to 60hp ....Youd think i was buying a 50 foot yacht lol.  Ive done some heavy reading about boat accident stats....basically if you dont drink and boat...there are 42 boat related casualties per year in canada from boating....8(7)% of these deaths would have been prevented had the people worn PFD's....so basically at this point id be insuring myself against the 2 people per year that die in power boating accidents that are wearing PFD's and werent drinking and boating.  Seems insane right? I honestly couldnt believe the stats were that low...the large majority of boat accidents are people that are fishing that fall overboard without a PFD or are drunk...not really surprising when you think about it."

1024041,AKRISONER,2018-03-06 14:02:00,5558,"Hey Lew, They are one of the companies that quoted me, they require a Marine Survey for any boat over 15 years old."
1024045,Lape0019,2018-03-06 14:30:00,647,"Akrisoner, You have already figured out that this is a requirement. It is not something a lot of us even think about when buying a boat because it only applies to people with 15-20 year old boats. Having said that, I think it also only applies to fiberglass boats as my father was asked to provide one after owning it a few years and when it hit 20 years old. This boat was an aluminum Lund. He called the insurance company up and said it was aluminum and they said not to worry about it then. As you have also found out, insurance really is optional on boats but with anything, it's always good to have for the ""what if"" scenarios. I've always carried insurance on my boat more so because it covers other things as well like if you ruin your lower unit and need a new one. They aren't exactly cheap. In your case, it may not be worth it but I would encourage you to ask some harder questions to the insurance company before getting a survey. If you do need a new lower, would they pay for it or would they write off the boat? what about hull damage? same thing? My decision to insure would be based on that and not the liability side since your research shows the truth about boating in Canada. Now with my new boat, insurance wasn't an option. I needed it for financing and I didn't want to take the risk that if I hit something, I'd have to pay out of pocket for a brand new lower unit and any repairs to the hull. I'm figuring the LU on the new boat is $5,000 at least and I know hull work isn't cheap as a buddy just put in a claim for like $9,000 from hitting a shoal. Pretty much put on a new hull lol."
1024046,AKRISONER,2018-03-06 14:39:00,5558,"I started asking these questions and they admitted that should anything happen they are going to write the boat off...I also couldnt be bothered to pay the $1000 dollar deductible to get the extra 2 thousand they would give me along with the increased premiums on anything I insure for the rest of my life. I already accepted the fact that even if anything happened to my boat, I wouldnt make a claim because it wouldnt be worth it. My loss if I crash the boat...the boating stats kinda shocked me that they were so low...but it makes a lot of sense, especially on the areas I boat, the only yahoos seem to be on jet skis...surprise surprise...and thats not my responsibility"
1024051,Lape0019,2018-03-06 15:29:00,647,Yeah...  That would make my mind up pretty quick.

1024059,jimmer,2018-03-06 16:23:00,2730,"Welcome to the world where insurance companies rule it. I would lean towards not insuring it.  However, you require insurance if you are going to fish organized tournaments. This stuff drives me crazy."

1024067,G.mech,2018-03-06 17:33:00,830,One other consideration which has not been mentioned is that many boats get damaged while being trailered on the road or in storage.   I always thought they were covered with the tow vehicle while being towed but recently found out that only the trailer is covered and not the load itself (i.e. the boat).  Likely not a big factor in Akri's case by the sound of things but may be a consideration for others.
1024069,AKRISONER,2018-03-06 17:41:00,5558," good point G, this is exactly what happened to the previous owner and the reason for the hull repair. He was trailering and something kicked up off of the road and hit the side of the boat damaging the fibreglass on the left side. He explained that he was pretty upset because he ended up paying a heck of a lot of money out of pocket to repair the hull because it wasnt covered by his truck's insurance."
1024077,Old Ironmaker,2018-03-06 19:19:00,8243,"Tell him it's part of a ""Living Will"" no payback required. My kid brother suggested my parents do that for him. I told him he better make sure he has a will in order. As far as the difficulty insuring an older glasser as they say ""You learn something everyday."" A gent brought his boat in to our little hobby marine shop where I help the guys work on boats to keep us out of trouble over the winter. A gent brought in a early model 17' glass StarCraft that he could feel a soft spot in the floor. The boat looked mint for any age. The thing was rotten to the hull, it is surprising the I/O didn't fall through the hull as the motor mounts were basically hanging by a treaded bolt. We have been working on it since DEC 1. Looks can be deceiving on a glass boat. It all started years back from a non tight cover that let water in the aft corners and got trapped between the outside stringers. You could pull some of the wood out in pieces by hand. I was once told on another site by a broker Canadians generally do not insure their off road toys, and many never register them. Your Skeeter was stored indoors so you should not have a problem. If you keep it outside get the best, tightest mooring cover you can. A snap down towing cover isn't the same. When mine is parked I use 8 large Javex bottles full of water hanging on the grommets to keep the mooring cover much tighter than with a draw string. If you need a cover I have a lead on a custom cover maker at a good price, she uses Sunbrella. My Sunbrella cover is over 20 years old. If you are interested PM me. I saw 2 guys in a boat on the Grand today fishing in Dunnville."
