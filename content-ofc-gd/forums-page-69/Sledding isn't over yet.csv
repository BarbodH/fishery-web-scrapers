1024453,fishindevil,2018-03-13 21:10:00,6254,"not too bad matt I just got back from Cochrane a few weeks ago so far this winter I have done 3,000km over 6,0000km in 2 winters...... lots of winter left yet just have to chase the snow"
1024454,muskymatt,2018-03-13 21:17:00,2608,"That's awesome. Southern and eastern Ontario had a stupidly short season but yeah, there is still some prime conditions to be had. I hope to put 500-600 on this weekend between Saturday and Sunday. Hopefully the 15+ cms they are getting this week will expand the trails a bit. Can still do 130+ kms one way. "
1024456,irishfield,2018-03-13 22:27:00,26272,I'll be back on it tomorrow... although there is still a good foot here at home in the yard! 
1024465,DRIFTER_016,2018-03-14 01:10:00,10439,Another 6 weeks or so left up here.

1024482,Old Ironmaker,2018-03-14 14:24:00,8243,"I'm happy you sleders and ATV guys finally got some snow. For the last 2 winters there wasn't enough snow here in southern Ontario to shovel, not once. Muskymatt, the last 2 pics of the trail look identical as our laneway into the property here. Identical."
