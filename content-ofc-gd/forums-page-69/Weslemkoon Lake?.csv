1023937,dave524,2018-03-04 14:10:00,4508,"check the opener if going in June, especially early"
1023943,misfish,2018-03-04 18:52:00,29133,30+ years ago. The bass fishing was amazing. That was before the WWW.
1023949,grimsbylander,2018-03-04 19:49:00,3016,^^^ That's a fact. It's not the lake it was.
1023950,misfish,2018-03-04 20:33:00,29133,^^^^^^^^ NOTHING IS
1023951,grimsbylander,2018-03-04 20:37:00,3016,I wouldn't say nothing...Erie is better now than it was 10/15 years ago.
1023953,Dan668,2018-03-04 20:44:00,1120,"Agreed. I havent fished Weslemkoon yet, it was on a list of mine but had others recommend other lakes as they too stated its not what it used to be."
1023954,misfish,2018-03-04 20:48:00,29133,I was referring to WWW ruining access and info.
1023955,grimsbylander,2018-03-04 20:58:00,3016," I know Brian, but everyone says thatÂ and in a lot of cases it's true. But I also remember fishing bass tournaments in 30 years ago and you could get into the money with 12-13lbs and 14-18 was a guaranteed top 3 finish."
1023963,dave524,2018-03-04 22:45:00,4508,"I've fished Erie with dad starting in the late 50's. I remember he won 3rd in a tournament in the mid 70's with a 3 1/2 pound smallie, think 4 even won it. Today they cull those fish."
