One day I am particularly upset about not capturing on video saw my little cove really come to life, I lost 5 BIG fish and landed 3 nice ones, only have cell phone footage of releasing one and a couple of pics from that day................             I did however manage to get my first visit to the cove on Video, it was a really good session too. I hooked into my biggest ever snapper, lost a couple big ones and got a few smaller fish too, which I gave to the security guard who waved me through the private land access to my spot every morning.

Now when I wake up I have a new spot on my face and forehead where it looks like someone took a brown Bingo dabber to me. Cover up dear Sir. Man I sound like my Mom!

My dad would eat a small fried fish every morning for breakfast too.        LOL, i'll be 52 in a week, you better be 100yrs old or I aint listening to you MUM."
