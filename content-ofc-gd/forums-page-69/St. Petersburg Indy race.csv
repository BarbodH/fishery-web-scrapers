Robert Wickens a Canadian rookie on the Indy Car circuit is trading the lead all race, led most laps. 2 laps to go and he is trying to pass race leader Rossi and they touch. Race over and Sebastien Bourdais wins in the town where he lives. The Canuck came close but no cigar. A rookie to Indy, not to auto racing, 28 years old that has been trying to get a Formula 1 ride for many years. Lets root for him in the Indy 500 in May. He is a road course racer though not an oval guy, big difference. Everyone will know his name by the end of the season."
