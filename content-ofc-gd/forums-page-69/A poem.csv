Glacial Green When I first seen that mountain stream, 	It caught my eye with such a gleam; 	I came to learn they call it Glacial Green. Hearkened the color comes from glacial till and snow. 	When you see that color you will know. 	You might agree: it’s a stream’s magic show. 	  	It only lasted a day until the rain started to descend. 	That brilliant undulance came to an end. 	And a brown swirling froth did impend. Glacial Green, where’d she go! 	I need to know... 	Glacial Green, I miss you so! Rain tapered off and the sun made its way. 	Espied to find nothing but a grand ole day; 	Found myself back down by the stream’s array. 	  	The Green is enhanced by the sun. 	Diamonds bounce off the surface and strike you like a gun. 	Friend, the sublimity you find is simply bar none. Some say they prefer a gin flow. 	But it’s harder to fool a fish and the water’s so low! 	Come...come on brethren it’s gettin green - - let’s go! Glacial Green, she’s gettin’ clean 	She’s turning! 	Glacial Green do you know what I mean? As the water greens the Salmonids stir. 	Steelhead ascend for miles: a feat for sure 	I admire the chrome fish much like Muir admired Big Sur. A mysterious and haunting shadow is cast in a pool. 	Great fish are you aware of my presence...you’ll... 	Tell me Glacial Green: Does he play me like a fool? Ole Green...she spoke to me in a faint soft cry. 	She said, “tie and sink your biggest dressed pink fly; 	Soon to cradle rainbow hued steel til you die”. Glacial Green, she’s gettin’ clean 	She’s turning! 	Glacial Green you’re the Queen!
