1074706,captpierre,2021-07-08 20:04:00,2521,Filled up today at Gen 7 station Marine 91 Ethanol Free $1.169 Hope it’s good gas. First time purchasing ethanol free there.
1074707,porkpie,2021-07-08 20:19:00,2521,Cheap.  Regular was 1.42 per litre in north bay yesterday
1074709,lew,2021-07-08 20:45:00,12766,$1.34 at Youngs Point today....up from $1.27 yesterday.
1074710,captpierre,2021-07-08 21:21:00,2521,Regular at same station $1.089
1074711,AKRISONER,2021-07-08 22:08:00,5558,Can anyone confirm the supplier of curve lakes gas? Is it Original Traders Energy?  they supply wolf energy on the 400 as well.
1074716,fishindevil,2021-07-09 10:10:00,6254,yes thats the supplier i seen the gas truck in there a few weeks ago
1074717,John,2021-07-09 12:11:00,2956,Funny how gas prices have become a secondary focus.
1074718,glen,2021-07-09 12:33:00,2641,It should be about 80c.
1074719,Beans,2021-07-09 13:02:00,3339,"Curve Lake is usually $0.10 per liter cheaper than most places...not worth driving all the way over to get gas but if we are passing that way to Buckhorn, Lakefield or Peterborough... Lately it has been around $0.25 per liter cheaper...Worth the trip over... "
1074762,captpierre,2021-07-10 16:22:00,2521,I wonder if Native gas stations don’t have to pass on the carbon tax as well.
1074763,misfish,2021-07-10 16:32:00,29133,My float boat passes gas stations all the time . Never a fret of the price. LOL
1074769,AKRISONER,2021-07-10 21:39:00,5558,Got myself filled up yesterday. the new gas station there has a marine specific pump to the side for those of you looking for it.  wish wolf energy had one Diesel was 98 cents a litre too!
1074770,lew,2021-07-10 21:53:00,12766,"Strange as it seems, I'm only 15 minutes from Curve Lake yet I've never gone there for gas but with everywhere getting pretty expensive lately maybe it's time I took the drive."
1074775,Beans,2021-07-10 23:39:00,3339,Hey Lew...Here is the site I look at to find how much Curve Lake is charging for regular... $1.09 today  http://www.ontariogasprices.com/GasPriceSearch.aspx
1074778,lew,2021-07-11 06:05:00,12766,Thanks Norm
