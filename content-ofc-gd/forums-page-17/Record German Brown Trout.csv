1074691,mamona,2021-07-08 14:08:00,597,44lb... it looks like it will end up on that wall.
1074692,Rizzo,2021-07-08 14:33:00,4754,quote from the article: “it was the biggest brown trout I have ever seen.” um considering it is a world record...no kidding Ridiculous fish. I am sure what sounds to be a very busy fishery will now be busier
1074732,BillM,2021-07-09 15:21:00,17367,"Dirty triploid, lol."
1074733,dave524,2021-07-09 16:45:00,4508,"I didn't think triploid fish farm escapees were eligible for records, wasn't a Bow caught and disqualified a few years back ?"
1074734,woodenboater,2021-07-09 16:53:00,2277,"didn't want to give away location, but there are three canals. um, so that certainly keeps it secret lol"
1074745,John Bacon,2021-07-10 02:23:00,3277,"I think the official world record bow from lake Diefenbacker is a triploid.  	However, I haven't seen any evidence that this brown is a triploid."
1074746,BillM,2021-07-10 02:30:00,17367,Sure looks like a hatchery fish to me.  Just one persons opinion however.   Reminds me of the mutant rainbows I catch around Parry Sound.
1074750,dave524,2021-07-10 09:59:00,4508,"Either way, whether this brown is triploid or not, I don't agree with Frankenfish being eligible for records."
1074752,John Bacon,2021-07-10 12:52:00,3277,"Maybe, but hatchery fish doesn't mean that it's a triploid."
1074758,misfish,2021-07-10 15:27:00,29133," What ever it is,I would be more then happy to tour the fishing world to show it off."
1074759,John Bacon,2021-07-10 15:31:00,3277,It would have been fun catching that from your pontoon boat.
1074761,misfish,2021-07-10 16:03:00,29133,I am still waiting to hook into a  good king off Thornbury to take me for a tour.
1074797,BillM,2021-07-12 03:18:00,17367,Nope you're right it doesn't.   Just looking at it screams triploid to me.   Similar to what the Konrad boys pull out of Diefenbaker.
1074799,AKRISONER,2021-07-12 12:43:00,5558,Man are they fun…
1074828,BillM,2021-07-13 01:11:00,17367,No doubt.  And they eat anything.
