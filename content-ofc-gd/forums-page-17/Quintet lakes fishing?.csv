Does anybody have any experience fishing this body of water?very little info online"
1074888,smitty55,2021-07-16 00:35:00,928,"Fish ON-Line only shows it as 1 lake with Brook Trout being stocked every two to four years. For fish it shows Brookies, Lakers and White Sucker. https://www.lioapplications.lrc.gov.on.ca/fishonline/Index.html?viewer=FishONLine.FishONLine&locale=en-CA"
1074891,Chuck Enwinde,2021-07-16 04:25:00,247,It's brook trout country. And apparently there are some good ones in Quintet.  Not a ton of walleye lakes in that area.  https://www.sdc.gov.on.ca/sites/MNRF-PublicDocs/EN/ProvincialServices/ScienceAndResearch/BsM/BsM-EN-Quintet_Lakes-FMZ10-Cyc01-16-7098-52235/BsM-EN-Quintet_Lakes-FMZ10-Cyc01-16-7098-52235.html
