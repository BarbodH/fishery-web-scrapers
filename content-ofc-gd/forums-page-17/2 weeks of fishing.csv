1075099,kickingfrog,2021-07-25 01:26:00,8333,Two weeks on 2 lakes. We whacked  the smallmouth on topwaters but only had some random esox when I wasn’t trying.             My brother's dock pike had a lamprey on it.   Over 80 inches of esox caught on 5 and a half inches of lures while trolling for walleye.
