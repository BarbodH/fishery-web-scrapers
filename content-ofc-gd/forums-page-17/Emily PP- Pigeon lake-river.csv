1075224,UpliftAura,2021-08-01 06:51:00,7,Im heading out to Emily provincial park in a few days and am going to try out some fishing while I’m there. If anyone has had any experience with musky or walleye. I do have a canoe so I’m not going to be strictly fishing from shore. Thanks.
1075226,porkpie,2021-08-01 14:29:00,2521,I’ve caught many musky in the river not far from the park.  Buzz baits always effective
1075227,John,2021-08-01 15:45:00,2956,Never did very well on Walleye. Muskie on top water or spinner baits. Drop shot worked well for bass. Watch out for the idiots tearing through the narrow channels. In a canoe you will be quite vulnerable to getting tossed by big wake.

1075239,Rizzo,2021-08-02 12:58:00,4754,good luck let us know how you do! I have fished Pigeon a lot but never been further down then maybe a km or 2 south of Gannons. Either way sounds like plenty of musky to be had down there
1075241,lew,2021-08-02 13:28:00,12766,I've caught a ton of Pigeon Lake muskies over the years and when casting always did well with brightly colored bucktails in the north end and big spinnerbaits in the shallower southern half of the lake.
