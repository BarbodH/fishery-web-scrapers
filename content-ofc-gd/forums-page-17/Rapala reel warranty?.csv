Bought it for under a $100 a few months back at Sail the receipt is long gone so Sail tried but basically SOL. Only used 3 times and when It seemed “locked up” yesterday and unusable so I took to Sail for a look. They were great, took it apart to see the plastic spool had cracked and the line just wedged in. It worked great last week so this is a surprise. I think it has landed 1 12lbs salmon but nothing huge. Sorry to make a big story out of a cheap reel but just wondering if anyone has tried warranty stuff with Rapala Canada and if its worth it for this “economical” reel. I will probably fire off a email and maybe check if I can find a replacement spool. Thx ahead."
