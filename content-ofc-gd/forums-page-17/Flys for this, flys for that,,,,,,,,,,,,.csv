I was out for whities and lakers this morning, but non to play with, so I headed in after a few hours and decided to rig up a drop shot rig. 7grm vibrado and a fly as a drop. What a combo I must say. I just let the float boat drift, twitching the virdrado off the bottom. Perch and small smallies were smashing and grabbing the baits.Â  Looks like I have another winner fly that can be tied in various colors. This one was olive marabou and grizzly hackle as wings. Beauty start to the morning .    It looks like a real bug to me,,,,,,,,,    "

Got a few more to try. I want to make some fly swim baits, but it takes time . The one I am working on has some bouncy, so you can have like a 3-6 inch leader drop ."

1075281,Rustic-Fisher,2021-08-03 23:32:00,826,Nice work !! Wish I had the patience to tie some of those creations !
