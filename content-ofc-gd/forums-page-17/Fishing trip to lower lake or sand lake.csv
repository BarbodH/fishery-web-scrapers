Was wondering if anyone has fished these lakes they're north of Terrace Bay. Also is there a place to put a boat in and is there a spot to set up a tent there for a couple days (not looking for a camp ground) looking to ruff it for a couple days. Looks like the Longlac Backroad will get me there, if not or if there's a better way to access these lakes I appreciate any pointers. Thanks everyone."
