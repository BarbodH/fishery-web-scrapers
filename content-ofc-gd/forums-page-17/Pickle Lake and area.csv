I moved to Pickle Lake a week ago (from Alberta) and i need advice as to where to fish. I know there's lots of great lakes up here but i have no idea where to start. I don't have a boat (yet) but i can use a canoe. The locals are friendly but hesitant to give up any of their spots. I've tried Pickle Lake itself with very limited success, and I'm wondering if it holds enough walleye to put an ice shack on it this winter. Ive tried a few other spots like Lake St Joe at the Old Post boat launch, Whiz Lake (for brookies), parts of the Otoskwin River etc.  If anyone has been up this way, any help would be greatly appreciated. Cheers.    "
