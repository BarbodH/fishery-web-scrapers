1075106,Raycaster,2021-07-25 13:51:00,528,I’m getting more comfortable on Lake Ontario and have been seeing success with Salmon/trout trolling but its time for Balsam for a few weeks. I guess I’m in the 1% of guys really targeting Pike. If a wally.bass or Musky come along thats great too but I enjoy Pike. South Bay and Ant Island is my usual go to but have started patrolling the shores to Coboconk. Any success stories recently on Balsam would be appreciated.
