1075282,gordy28,2021-08-03 23:41:00,638,"So I have no experience with the lake or Air Cochrane it looks like Audrey is fairly shallow w a few deep holes.   In August I would tend to start deep or focus on areas w current I had posted two articles a while back based on my groups trips https://www.northernjacks.com/post/top-5-walleye-lures-for-northern-ontario https://www.northernjacks.com/post/walleye-magnets The other tip would be to check satellite maps of the lake and look for irregularities re mid lake humps, main points, island and large weed beds Also push your outfitter for a map of spots to start   Its in their best interest to ensure you catch fish best of luck sounds like an awesome outing   Please share how you make out Andrew "

1075294,Reidt4,2021-08-04 11:23:00,5,"Fantastic, I will keep these tips in mind.  My kids will have a blast trying these out.  I will let you know how we make out when we get back"
1075295,Reidt4,2021-08-04 11:25:00,5,"Thats exactly we we picked Audrey, a chance for pike, walleye and bookies.  We are excited about the trip."
