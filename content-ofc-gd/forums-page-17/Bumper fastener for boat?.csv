1075117,Raycaster,2021-07-25 19:45:00,528,Got this boat last year used and it has 2 fasteners secured that I assume are for bumpers. Can’t seem to find the matching connectors online (getting old). If anyone uses them and can point me in the right direction I’d appreciate it. Thx.

1075121,Raycaster,2021-07-25 22:06:00,528,Thx guys.
1075122,kickingfrog,2021-07-26 00:17:00,8333,Would a knot on the end of a rope work?
1075134,Raycaster,2021-07-27 17:11:00,528,Looks like a easy enough piece to make but might be better served to just replace with full sets. Thx guys.
1075135,dave524,2021-07-27 17:40:00,4508,I suspect the swivel keys are attached to the bumpers
