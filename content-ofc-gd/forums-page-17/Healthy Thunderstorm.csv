1075020,kickingfrog,2021-07-21 01:18:00,8333,All dayÂ there have been storm watches. They marched down from northern Ontario. Every satelliteÂ image had it. I went fishing this morning and got back in time for brunch and watched the storm danceÂ across the lake. Pumped the boat out this afternoon and went back out.
