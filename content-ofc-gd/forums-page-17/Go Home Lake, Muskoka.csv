Under the MNR review it says that muskie are present in the lake as a major species, although I have heard no news of anyone ever catching one there, and have never seen one there myself. Wondering if anyone has any input about this seeing as the lake is technically a layoff from georgian bay and the gibson river."
1075221,Rizzo,2021-08-01 01:30:00,4754,I have fished there a couple times (years ago...before I was interested in musky) and I never heard of anyone catching a musky in Go Home Lake. Even for other species I found the fishing there to be so so.
