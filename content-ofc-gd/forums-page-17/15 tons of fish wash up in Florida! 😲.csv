1074808,aplumma,2021-07-12 17:48:00,6896,"The red tide is actually not something that is new. It is not weather related but rather from over abundance of nutrients. ""Â 215 million gallons of nitrogen-rich wastewater made its way into the bay earlier this year from the site of an old fertilizer plant, the Tampa Bay Times reported. The algae feed on phosphorus and nitrogen.""Â Â The Florida conservation core has been working with the holding lakes and trying not to draw them down unless they are full from to much rain. This water used to flow through the everglades and nature filtered it out before it bloomed. With Big Sugar using more of the land for Sugar Cane the filtering has become to low to cure the issue. They are trying to return more of the land back to being the filter but it will take time and effort to make the red and green algaeÂ blooms go away. Art"
1074809,AKRISONER,2021-07-12 18:22:00,5558,"this same factory is the one that destroyed lake okechobe a few years ago right? Politicians down there getting lobbied to allow this company to dump that fertilizer in the water ways...good stuff. lets just say im glad I live in Canada where we dont let corporations destroy our fresh water resources at a price. If you can believe it, they still ""spray"" weeds down there. We used to allow that kinda stuff up here too, im glad we dont anymore."
1074811,aplumma,2021-07-12 18:36:00,6896,The factory is closed now but the clean up continues from the contamination in the soil. Rain and storms have continued to escape the containment barriers and other methods in effect. The solution is dilution but this is a political minefield and both sides have dug in for the battle. With the differences of ground composition and water stratus what works up North does not work Down South. Art
1074814,smitty55,2021-07-12 20:47:00,928,"Not to nitpick but they still spray for noxious weeds around here. The wild parsnip invasion is going full bore here and Lanark County sprays county roads to try and control them. Residents are allowed to opt out of the spraying but they are expected to control them on their own in the ditches and if they don't they lose their opt out options. It's not blanket spraying though, they actually target individual plants but only within the 66ft wide road allowances."
1074819,G.mech,2021-07-12 20:54:00,830,"Almost all field crops are still sprayed as well, millions of acres with both herbicides and pesticides.Â Â  The only spraying that was stopped was for residential ornamental use but that made people feel good...I guess it worked."
1074821,smitty55,2021-07-12 20:56:00,928,"For sure, many of the local farmers around here still kill their fields off every so often. Saw that this late spring."
1074822,AKRISONER,2021-07-12 21:06:00,5558,"Smitty, I was referring to spraying of weeds in lakes. Quite literally dumping herbicides into the water to kill off plant life for the purpose of improving recreational boat use. Itâ€™s pretty wild."

1074837,aplumma,2021-07-13 12:28:00,6896,Lake Okeechobee was dammed in 1937 to help with flood control. It is a shallow lake that used to filter off into the everglades. As more of the everglades were turned into sugar cane fields they used canals to move the water instead of wetlands thus making filtration minimum at best. They then started discharging it down the Kissimmee River which runs quickly to the Gulf of Mexico. The resulting blooms of green algae were kill zones in the river and as it got into the Gulf it makes red algae blooms. The State of Florida is trying to release water much in the way Lake Nippissing does to lower the water gradually in the fall or spring to make room for more rain as they go into the rain season. This is not a new issue and this happens all over the place from New York to Florida where chemical intrusions occur. Art
