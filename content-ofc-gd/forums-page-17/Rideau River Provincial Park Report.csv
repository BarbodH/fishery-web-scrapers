1075356,floater,2021-08-07 11:20:00,220,Went to Rideau PP this week. A very weedy river. Boat launch was good but the Wardens didn't want you leaving your boat in the water because all the other boats wouldn't have a place to dock.  Didn't see many other boats fishing! Managed to catch my PB pickeral in the first ten minutes of fishing with a worm harness. Slowed down after that. Later on I caught my PB muskie and my first one outside of the Otonabee river. Very nice. A good pike followed. The fishing wasn't fast and furious during the day but the evening bite was way better. Lots of big boat traffic and they don't slow down. Lots of big wakes shaking you up. I liked Murphys Point PP better as there were multiple bays around to fish in. Still it was a good trip.
