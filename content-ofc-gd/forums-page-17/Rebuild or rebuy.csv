1075186,wkrp,2021-07-30 15:46:00,656,My Merc starter finally gave in on me after 19 years. Now I am faced with the decision of whether to have to buy or rebuild. Anyone have any input on rebuilding as it is a lot cheaper.
1075187,Rizzo,2021-07-30 16:04:00,4754,I have never rebuilt but what size is the engine? If smaller I would likely just start over with new...bigger? Ya would definitely look into a repair if the engine has been solid otherwise

A rough idea on new prices? https://www.amazon.com/DB-Electrical-SAB0168-50-859377T-50-884044T/dp/B008CQRSN6"

1075207,AKRISONER,2021-07-31 10:25:00,5558,Definitely depends on how much power you have. also worth considering is how much money on fuel you will save with for example a newer four stroke vs an old two. especially with gas at 1.30+
1075219,porkpie,2021-08-01 00:33:00,2521,My buddy had the starter on his 2012 merc 150 rebuilt and as far as I know it turned out fine.
