1075026,limeyangler,2021-07-21 14:49:00,5204,"Had a bunch of follows yesterday evening and got a consolation prize of a wee little one that chased a whopper plopped a full 100yrds, made quite a wake for such a little guy. I couldn’t help notice the distinct ‘bars’ on it… tiger musky? "
1075028,glen,2021-07-21 15:19:00,2641,No.  Barred Muskie.
1075030,glen,2021-07-21 15:22:00,2641,
1075031,glen,2021-07-21 15:22:00,2641,Tiger
1075034,BillM,2021-07-21 17:17:00,17367,First pick is all muskie.
1075044,AKRISONER,2021-07-21 19:57:00,5558,yup (s)hes a barred specimen
1075048,kuhaman,2021-07-21 21:03:00,503,Yup
1075056,John Bacon,2021-07-22 03:05:00,3277,Tiger muskies tend to have rounded fins like a pike.  The fins in the first picture look more pointed like a muskie.  I agree with those saying it's pure muskie.
1075065,Rizzo,2021-07-22 20:27:00,4754,one more vote for barred musky...but a beauty little fish at that! Smaller muskies can have such amazing patterns
1075067,Master of Bait,2021-07-22 20:59:00,196,Nice fish! I say barred as well. 100 yard chase? Heckuva cast. Trolled? Those ploppers sure produce!
1075069,Rizzo,2021-07-22 22:33:00,4754,"haha never noticed the 100 yard part til now. That is a loong cast if you indeed were casting. For trolling, I wonder how far muskies will travel following a lure? I watched one follow in the prop wash for a while, he definitely got pulled away from his home zone as he followed me around."
1075071,limeyangler,2021-07-23 02:46:00,5204,"Hundred yards might be an exaggeration… lol…but easily 75 feet. I actually use a spinning reel on a Heavy St.croix, I can cast pretty darned far, and it’s what I’m used to, I have the Tranx and a Beast, not a fan of bait casters."
1075078,nlpaintballer,2021-07-23 16:04:00,122,I am with you limey. St. Croix xtra heavy fast action paired with a ci4 4000. Awesome setup for everything. 
1075084,limeyangler,2021-07-23 18:01:00,5204,"Cool, yeah I have an xtra heavy and a heavy St.croix. I recently got the xtra heavy because I was losing too many fish, don’t think the heavy action had enough backbone for good hook sets, especially at distance. I also have a Stradic 4000 spooled with 30lb power pro Super Slick8, works like a dream, casts to the horizon and no birds nests, also much more versatile setup than with the bait caster, a bait caster would be virtually unworkable for when I visit Antigua with the prevailing gale force easterly winds that rarely drop below 30kmh ."
