1075017,Fishn Technishn,2021-07-21 00:38:00,198,Was on Stoney Lake last week and found a new to me rock! Not a lot of damage but bad enough that I require some rivets to be replaced Anyone have any suggestions for a reputable repair service. I am in London but can drive a little ways for the right repairs Any help much appreciated Thanks Mike

1075093,misfish,2021-07-24 19:01:00,29133,"There is a guy here,but yer a bit of a drive away . I see boats in his yard every week I pass by. Little guy and a small shop. Info for you,,, Alumifab Custom Aluminum Fabrication, located at 576 Essa Road in Barrie 705 331 2022"
1075102,Fishn Technishn,2021-07-25 12:48:00,198,thanks I will check out Mike
1075104,Cast-Away,2021-07-25 13:41:00,790,I had a dozen rivets replaced at Heritage Marine in London two years ago and was very happy with them. You can see my write-up in Google. Since that time the ownership has changed and there are a few bad reviews but who is to say that the actual staff all turned over? I am sure that they are mostly the same people.
1075111,dave524,2021-07-25 17:39:00,4508,"A fellow on this forum had his Lund completely restored about 10 years ago here, was happy with the work, not cheap though  https://www.bankesmarineservices.com/"
1075124,Fishn Technishn,2021-07-26 00:49:00,198,Thanks Dave524. I did contact Ron Bankes and he informed that he is retired form that service and now does Duck Boat building exclusively I have also left multiple messages/emails with Heritage Marine.....NO REPLY as yet
1075129,Steve,2021-07-27 01:19:00,2075,"That was me. Was in 2009. Good memory. Still have the Lund. Still fishes strong. And nope, not cheap. But compared to boat prices these days, it almost seems affordable now."
1075131,dave524,2021-07-27 09:40:00,4508,Still fishing spring browns on the south shore of lake Ontario  ?   I recall that was sort of a passion for you?
1075138,Steve,2021-07-27 21:39:00,2075,sure do. Most of my fishing these days is spring brown trout fishing (then the subsequent salmon fishing) until bass in June. Bass is what I fish the rest of the season.
1075139,Hack_Fisherman,2021-07-28 00:28:00,720,If you want to fix yourself I’ve got lots of 5/32” solid aluminum rivets if you need some. You need an air hammer and rivet setting tool (available at aircraft spruce Branford or online or Spaenaur in Kitchener) plus good 5/32” drill bit (rivet removing tool from aircraft spruce also works well)
1075147,Sinker,2021-07-28 16:21:00,8692,"I have all the tools and rivets to fix that, but its a little more than i would attempt personally. That' is a nasty hole in your boat. I hope you are ok after that, and nobody was injured!  S."
1075160,Hack_Fisherman,2021-07-29 02:39:00,720,"I don’t think it’s a hole, only a separation of the keel. Nasty bump indeed though"
1075161,Fishn Technishn,2021-07-29 03:43:00,198,luckily no one was hurt! Just my SIL 's pride! Mike
1075206,cisco,2021-07-31 07:01:00,597,"Me, I'd contact the manufacturer and try and order a new keel to replace the one that has been ....torn, stretched, twisted and generally no longer able to do its job. If riveted back it will simply twist the hull creating many stress points. To remove it and to try straightening it would be allot of work and even afterwards, the holes to re-attach won't line up IMO. Haven't checked but perhaps aftermarket replacement keels are available online."
1075209,Fishn Technishn,2021-07-31 16:44:00,198,Going to take the boat to an authorized Sylvan/Smokercraft dealer for a quote soon. When I talked to them by phone they mentioned ordering a new keel .  Will post when I know more Mike
