393814,jediangler,2009-10-16 23:36:00,1923,I caught that clip on the news but changed the channel as it turned my stomach. Glad to hear the little one made it through OK.
393821,sturgman,2009-10-17 00:22:00,249,Seen this tonight on the news also.. There obviouslly was a decline of the ground surface reaching towards the tracks to have a carriage roll off like that. Why arent all subway waiting areas protected with a negative rolling effect so this doesnt happen ever again.  Change the slope of the floor surface!!
