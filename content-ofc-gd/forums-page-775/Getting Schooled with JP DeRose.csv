393077,mojobass,2009-10-15 00:05:00,34,This week episode was sick! I never fish frogs before but I definitely need to try that out for sure. I never seem to be able to find weeds like that anywhere. Looking at JP's gear and my gear makes me feel like crap What do you guys think of this week's episode?
393085,aniceguy,2009-10-15 00:16:00,1094,"Funny you should post this, as I just actually sat and watched it.  As a WFN aficionado who seems to have it on 24/7 I ll go on a limb and say its pretty much the most imformative one going, he simplifies it right down to a 123 method.  I thought last year was pretty cool but this year is just over the top.......  Sooooo JP where was that slop exactly......"
393096,JPD,2009-10-15 00:33:00,296,"Bwahahahaha... wouldn't you love to know Louis,,,  Starts with a G ends in a Y and no I'm not calling you anything  Tons of water like this out there and tons of clone fish like the one's I was catching! I let you figure it out now... if it takes you too long I will be expecting a beer at the next meeting  BTW Mojo.... the gear is great and everything but when I first started fishing frogs about 10 years ago I loved using a Compre flipping stick 7'6"" with a Calcutta 200 and 40 lb Ironthread... It was heavy as a combo but I still caught a bunch of fish that way. Obviously now the rods are lighter and the reels cast further and of course the line doesn't feel like steel cable but the fish hit it just the same. I think the biggest advantage is less wear and tear on the arms and a longer cast!"
393102,solopaddler,2009-10-15 00:48:00,8605,Louis just got schooled.
393105,JPD,2009-10-15 01:02:00,296,I hear you do that to him quite often Solo
393108,solopaddler,2009-10-15 01:10:00,8605,    (Actually the man does have his moments.  )
393111,JPD,2009-10-15 01:13:00,296,We should get out on the river one day together with Louis... I would like to see one of these so called moments  !
