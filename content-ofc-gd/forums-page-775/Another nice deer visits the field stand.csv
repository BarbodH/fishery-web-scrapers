393949,misfish,2009-10-17 20:29:00,29133,"Ok first heres a nice couple of pics.Seems for sure, this stand is an afternoon/earlly evening spot.Now that Im feeling much better,I,ll be out there. Love the white around the eyes.I can tell forsure,but it might be a button.Real wide tail on this one.       This one I know is eating  apples, as I have seen some on the ground in that spot.    Ok now the mistry??????????  Same deer,I think I can see buttons.    The ones before,,,,,,,,      Besides the old straggly apple trees,what is it that gets them to do the same thing?????? I have not put any scent there since the 2nd of Oct.   As for the days events. I hit the climber stand this morning.Boy was the dew heavy.I was damp already by the time I got to the stand. I seen some turkeys around,but not shootable. Boy did it feel great to finally get back out there. Back again in the AM."
