392956,Rizzo,2009-10-14 18:20:00,4754,"Thanks Roy for helping get my photo gallery figured out. Got out last Friday to the Kawarthas in rainy conditions. On the water by 8 am and fished until 3. No luck casting so tried trolling, this skinny little guy hit a chartreuse believer in about 15 feet of water. Water temps were at 53 degrees. This fish was the only action we had for the day.    Then managed to sneak out Thanksgiving day for a few hours in the morning on the upper niagara. Was a little nervous about water clarity because its been so windy. Pretty pleased to see visibility of around 3.5 feet. Water temps were 57 degrees. Launched at Netherby where there was a big dead trout in my way. After avoiding the stinky carcass, motored up to Frenchman's creek and started working my way back to the launch. This fish also hit the chartreuse believer, which is quite surprising considering I almost never use it...although that is going to change! Fished about 4 hours, then had to pack it in to load up on turkey.  "
392961,Roy,2009-10-14 18:33:00,13728,Nice fish there Roger. Glad you made it out and had a good time.
392962,Terry,2009-10-14 18:35:00,14456,nice going
392981,Leecher,2009-10-14 19:06:00,7832,Couple of good looking ski's you got into    Good job Roger I guess you'll be using the believer from now on eh Thanks for sharing Leechman
393007,Rizzo,2009-10-14 20:05:00,4754,"Hard to avoid the obvious pun, but I've never been a believer in the believer. Have dragged it around the niagara every fall in a perch finish banging bottom without success. With the stained water I took out my gaudiest looking bait (the chartreuse believer) and let it go for a swim. Surprise surprise 2 fish in two days on it."
393013,Pigeontroller,2009-10-14 20:31:00,2793,Thats a couple of nice Esox!
393036,Greencoachdog,2009-10-14 22:18:00,8163,"A couple of beauty fish there Rizz!!!  ... and while they make a real nice picture, Muskies caught while trolling count for little or nothing eh?!!!  ... but thanks for taking the time to post anyway!!!"
393072,Rizzo,2009-10-14 23:52:00,4754," hahaha...I kind of agree with you though. I do very little trolling, only when I'm too cold to do anything else! Nothing better than casting and hooking into a musky on a short leash. I will admit that these were two of my lesser favorite muskies caught. The Kawartha fish made one jump within seconds of being hooked and then rolled in the line...it got all tangled up and couldn't fight. On the positive side it wasn't tired at all and took off like a shot on the release! The niagara fish too took off great too. It also made one jump, then basically swam right to the boat and into the net! I told my partner to watch out with the net as I expected it was just playing possum and would suddenly wake up, but never did. Kind of a strange thing to watch this fat little fish swim right to you and into the net! Guess he's done it before"
393081,Greencoachdog,2009-10-15 00:13:00,8163,  OMG!!!... I hadn't noticed it until now.. but look-it the butt-holes on these fish!!!  ... have you been sodomizing these fish when they've been landed Rizz???... please say it ain't so!!!  
393088,Forester,2009-10-15 00:18:00,46,"really nice fish, I haven't got anything over 36"" this year."
393124,Rizzo,2009-10-15 01:41:00,4754,"GCD you are too much...those are my fingers you're seeing, not a bum."
393207,irishfield,2009-10-15 09:16:00,26272,Great stuff Roger!
393248,corvette1,2009-10-15 12:33:00,1765,nice ski's congrats
393327,Squid,2009-10-15 15:59:00,1656,"Glen, put down the hootch!! Roger, really nice fish there. I will fish the Niagara and Buffalo harbour this weekend."
393340,mistaredone,2009-10-15 16:22:00,913,Nice fish!  Im jealous
393347,Guest Johnny Bass,2009-10-15 16:52:00,0,Looks like two solid Musky! That Niagara Musky looks like the same strain as a Lake St. Clair Musky.
393448,ehg,2009-10-15 21:54:00,2666,Nice muskies! Really shows the difference in appearance between Great Lakes strain and Kawarthas strain. Very nice
393485,Rizzo,2009-10-15 23:55:00,4754,"Big difference between the two. Those great lakes fish have some real nice spots...maybe a ""leopard musky""! The niagara musky was also about 6 inches shorter than the kawartha fish I'd say, but probably weighed 5 pounds more. Guess that's what you get from dining on suckers/trout rather than perch and pickerel"
393705,johnnyb,2009-10-16 15:41:00,3413,"Way to go, man...couple nice fish there!  First muskie I ever had hit on a firetiger believer....but to this day I still haven't landed one...bucktails are my first choice...then the believer..."

394247,snag,2009-10-19 02:01:00,1932,"Yeah, I'm jealous too.  No musky for me this year  Well, done and thanks for the info too.  Cheers,  S."
394294,lew,2009-10-19 11:17:00,12766,"WTG Roger, that's a couple nice fish.  I think I have every Believer colour EXCEPT chartreuse , so maybe I better get one for our upcoming December trip"
