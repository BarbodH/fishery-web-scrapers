393788,krawler,2009-10-16 22:25:00,167,I have a 16' aluminum.  I would like to troll the lower notty and the rivermouth for bows.  Also maybe try anchoring and drifting roe. Can someone tell me how far up the notty i can troll before it gets to shallow or hazardous?  I have trolled the lower section below the first bridge and the mouth.  It doesnt get much deeper than 6' give or take.  Ill be using my electric for trolling.  thanks

393794,krawler,2009-10-16 22:46:00,167,Thats where i have launched from before but have only fished from there to the mouth.  Is it safe to take the boat further upstream?
393795,misfish,2009-10-16 22:51:00,29133,"Why not leave yer boat at home and fish the OX BOWS. Travel along the main street south side of the river.Before you get to the the big bridge,make a left,at the water tower.Follow the road ."
