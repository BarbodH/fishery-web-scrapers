393321,bushart,2009-10-15 15:44:00,2628,Ya ever wonder where a pink Flamingo gets its colours from----same story  Bushart---the one and only source for all your useless information
393343,solopaddler,2009-10-15 16:36:00,8605, BWAHAHAHAHA!
393344,LeXXington,2009-10-15 16:47:00,1928,Yummy white meat.. wait till you see it at the sushi bento box near you.. extra charge
393355,l2p,2009-10-15 17:19:00,346,i always wondered if ppl who ate too much lake o salmon would eventually grow a kype of some sort LOL
393438,danjang,2009-10-15 21:36:00,148," This is 100% true. I would know, I'm a biologist."
393462,Greencoachdog,2009-10-15 22:47:00,8163,"  I know there are some red and orange shrimp in some places, but most of the freshwater and saltwater shrimp I've ever seen are translucent/clear when they're alive... they turn red, pink, or orange after they've died or have been cooked!  ... and all the Lake Trout I've ever caught have been caught on baitfish, as a mater of fact... baitfish are just about all I've ever heard anyone catching lakers on!  The diet theory doesn't hold any water with me... it sounds like an excuse people are making up to justify eating rotting fish... and to keep from hurling when they think about how much of it they have eaten!!!"
393500,solopaddler,2009-10-16 00:25:00,8605,"  Lake trout that subsist on baitfish have white meat. Most large bodies of water and many small inland lakes harbour white fleshed namaycush.  However many if not most of the lakers found in small infertile shield lakes are planktiverous in nature. Their diet is almost exclusively composed of crustaceons, shrimp, and bug larvae. These fish generally top out at 3-5lb's and their flesh is so orange it's almost red.  Their red flesh is entirely due to their planktiverous diet."
393503,Greencoachdog,2009-10-16 00:33:00,8163,"  uhhh, yeah... explain this:   and this:   Caught in Cold Lake Alberta on frozen anchovies."
393506,StoneFly,2009-10-16 00:44:00,574," I say you are only 4'6"" tall and that fish is 5lbs....LOLOLOLOLOLOL"
393508,richyb,2009-10-16 00:45:00,774,"I have only caught lakers from lake simcoe. The meat is orange and their diet is smelts, herring, and likely small whitefish."
393509,Greencoachdog,2009-10-16 00:50:00,8163,"  My name is not Herve Villechaize or Roy, I stand 5'-9"" in stocking feet!    That's what I'm talking about richyb!!!"
393517,Burtess,2009-10-16 01:04:00,901," The red or pink flesh comes from a diet rich in the pigment astaxanthin. Shrimp contain very high concentrations of astaxanthin.  When they are raw, you generally cannot see it.  It is covered by proteins which make the shells look dark.  When you cook the shrimp, the proteins denature (break down) and allow the pigment to be visible; they turn pink.  So when fish eat shrimp, they are ingesting a diet rich in astaxanthin, and it builds up in their flesh, giving it a pink or orange colour.  Burt"
393526,Greencoachdog,2009-10-16 01:20:00,8163,  So why is the astaxanthin not invisible in the fish flesh until cooked???... eeeeeewwww dude!!!.. I just realized that you're making up excuses for eating rotting salmonoid flesh too!!! *RETCH*
393529,Burtess,2009-10-16 01:22:00,901," Where do you think all that ""imitation crab"" meat comes from anyway???  Yummy....  Burt"
393533,Greencoachdog,2009-10-16 01:26:00,8163,  You can have my share of that Burt!... I don't support commercial fishing!!!
393566,Casey123,2009-10-16 02:46:00,461,I always find that eating any meat from Bronte can endanger ones well being.
393623,bushart,2009-10-16 11:57:00,2628,"Ok I'll do the research---Burt wins a years supply of Bronte salmon fillets on this one---always good when those unexpected relatives show up just before dinner,  taken from a nature website.  . It is Astaxanthine that give Flamingos their pink color. When shrimps eat algae the astaxanthine contained in them is incorporated into their chitin shell. When the Flamingos eat the shrimps the flamingos then incorporate the pigment into their feathers. Incidentally this is also why the meat or muscle of an adult wild salmon is pink. Farmed salmon raised on meal lacking the pigment have white appearing muscle. This is also why when you cook shrimp or lobster or crab they turn bright pink to red in color. Shrimps and lobsters don't look pink at first due to proteins in the shell obscuring the pigment. When the protein is denatured (cooked) it reveals the wonderful color. This is also true of the leaves of fall. When the green chlorophylls in the leaves are destroyed the reds and oranges and yellows of fall are revealed in their splendor!  OK Mr. Dawg we all know your tryin yur very best....keep up the fine effort  Bushart"
393625,Greencoachdog,2009-10-16 12:13:00,8163,  You Pink Flamingos theory sounds just Devine Bushy!  So what color is the flesh of the Salmon that the deep water Blue Zone boys catch in the summer?... are these not the same Salmon coming into the creeks now?  Does anyone have a pic of a Blue Zone Salmon fillet or steak they'd like to post?
393691,capt bruce,2009-10-16 15:15:00,820,"Sorry Dog I dont have any pictures , but I have run a charter boat on lake Ontario since 1980 and I clean the custermers catch at the end of the trip , so I have filleted 1,000s of deep water fresh not spawning fish and ALL OF THEM, lakers, kings ,cohos, alantics ,pinks,browns and steel head have white flesh ."
393038,Trevor0179,2009-10-14 22:31:00,65,Does anyone know why the salmon from bronte has white meat instead of pinky red?
393041,Kinger,2009-10-14 22:35:00,351,cause they are zombies...
393042,Greencoachdog,2009-10-14 22:35:00,8163,... because it's almost dead and decomposing? *insert hurl emoticon here*
393043,StoneFly,2009-10-14 22:36:00,574," Lol,..this is gonna get funny,...Its becasue they are dying!!!  It is red/pink in the lake but as soon as they hit the tribs they start to decay.  Simliar to Chrome Skin in the lake and Copper to black in the river.  DONT EAT IT!!!"
393044,MJL,2009-10-14 22:37:00,2427,I've always been told that their diet of alewife out in Lake Ontario was the reason for their lighter coloured flesh.
393049,solopaddler,2009-10-14 22:48:00,8605,Many of the fresh chrome specimens straight from the lake also have white meat. The colour of the meat is entirely due to diet.  Now pretty much every chinny in Bronte this late in the season will be decaying.  Mmmmm....white meat from Bronte. I think I just barfed a little inside my mouth.
393064,MJL,2009-10-14 23:12:00,2427," It helps if you don’t think of them as rotting. Think of them as ‘aging’…Like a fine wine or a premium cut of steak they only get better with time.  Once they’re in the rivers, and they’re ‘angus black’, the meat just falls off the bone…No fillet knife required  Mmmm…Finger lickin’ good  The other 200 anglers I met at the Credit last week can't all be wrong"
393067,highdrifter,2009-10-14 23:38:00,2534,thiamine deficiency??
393083,Trevor0179,2009-10-15 00:15:00,65,the fish wasnt very old she was a nice silver but starting to turn colour on the top when I got home and cut her open some of the eggs were still pretty tight to the skien never the less Im not going to eat I will give it all away.
393086,CLofchik,2009-10-15 00:16:00,854," What he said. Red in the meat comes from a more protein rich diet, alewife & smelt being oily forage (heh did you know you can light a dried smelt like a candle?) gives fish a white flesh that is not exactly the most palatable.  The red farmed fillets you see at your local grocer comes from food dye in the pellet food."
393093,dave524,2009-10-15 00:22:00,4508,"I always find that Coho have a redder flesh than Chinook, would the diet be that much different or is there some variation between species? I'm talking fish from out in the lake , well prespawn or staging fish ?"
393094,Greencoachdog,2009-10-15 00:26:00,8163,  Just remind yourself of that when your grandchildren come out with 4 eyes and tentacles instead of limbs!!!
393100,CLofchik,2009-10-15 00:46:00,854," I never noticed Ho's being that much different than Kings unless they were real small. Bows & Browns definitely go for shiners more than alewife so aren't near as greasy, maybe Ho's do the same now.  Hell I'd eat a bullhead before I braved a Lake O King...mmmmm spewing Mudshark!  "
393112,Greencoachdog,2009-10-15 01:17:00,8163,   The Bullheads are far more fitting than you deserve!!!!... and that should be more than you're entitled to!!!
393114,Guest steel'n'esox,2009-10-15 01:22:00,0,Those chinnies with the white meat are the ones that taste like walleyes just waiting for the fish crisp

393160,packrat,2009-10-15 02:49:00,93,Oh boy white meat-----smell like fish taste like chicken
393165,wuchikubo,2009-10-15 03:01:00,1114,"Diet is what I've been told and will believe. As above mentioned by MJL and Solo. I've caught Chinnies from Lake O with white (more grey) [Eewww] and red fleshed coho from G bay tribs. Definitely tastes different.  The salmon I see in the local grocer are usually Atlantic salmon or ""steelhead"" salmon (what's with that? don't they know the difference? They really are rainbow trout.)"
393175,Toronto_Angler,2009-10-15 03:33:00,698,The red from ocena raised fish is from the krill in the diet. This is also the reaosn that Ocean raised fish are full of Omega 3's while farm raised are not.
393225,bushart,2009-10-15 10:54:00,2628,I understand really red/orange flesh such as in Lake trout---freshwater shrimp  Bushart
393286,kemper,2009-10-15 14:02:00,2232,The diet answer is a good one...same reason why large resident trout from a river I fish have red flesh but the steelies that move through the same system have much lighter flesh
393291,perchslayer666,2009-10-15 14:25:00,280,The Diet answer is the only  one. What do Huron or GBay trout/salmon eat that makes their flesh pink/red?
393294,anders,2009-10-15 14:30:00,1168, Funniest thing i heard all day...thanks for the good laugh
393299,Oncoryncus,2009-10-15 14:45:00,3,"Genetics, for the most part. The original strain of Salmon used in Lake Ontario was based on the Tule Fall Chinook, which is west coast race that runs the rivers in the fall, spawns and dies quickly. They have grey/white meat.  There are also strains in Lake Ontario Chinooks that have pinker meat. Cross breeding over the last 30 years probably has produced characteristics from either race, so some Chinooks have white meat and some have pink meat. Diet also plays an important part for coloring the meat in the non-Tule strains, so more invertebrates or sticklebacks with lots of keratin in them will improve the color of the meat.  Also, the longer they are in the river the lighter the meat seems to get."
