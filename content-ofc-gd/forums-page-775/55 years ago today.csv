Some web sites about Hurricane Hazel in 1954.   http://archives.cbc.ca/environment/extreme...ther/topics/77/  http://www.hurricanehazel.ca/  http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/ind...s=A1ARTA0003923  http://images.google.ca/images?hl=en&r...ved=0CCgQsAQwAw"
393610,pikehunter,2009-10-16 08:05:00,1659,"Thanks for posting. This was just a couple of years before my time. My Grandmother lost her house on Hamilton's Van Wagner Beach during Hazel, got washed out into the lake."
393614,Roy,2009-10-16 10:41:00,13728,"I was only 7-8 when Hazel hit but I remember it well. I remember that as a kid, it was my first true appreciation for the power of nature."
393620,lew,2009-10-16 11:35:00,12766,"My folks had a brand new home built in Don Mills (Toronto suburb) and October 15th / 54  was moving day. Like Roy, I was only 7 years old but I remember that hurricane very clearly and can still see our things blowing around the neighbourhood while the movers, the neighbours & my parents tried to hold it all together and get it on the truck.  It was a wicked storm that killed more that 80 people in Toronto that day.  I've gone thru 3 more hurricanes since then and I think that's enuff for any lifetime.  Scary stuff......."
393729,Beans,2009-10-16 17:28:00,3339,"I remember that day very well. After work I had to walk from College and Yonge to Coxwell and Gerrard to pick up our baby son from the babysitter's...pouring rain and the water was up over the curbs in most places...took about 3 hours to walk that distance as I had to stop in store doorways every once in a while...  Babysitter was mad as hell and gave me whatfor as she was late for a date...""lady, take a look outside""...I then had to push the baby carriage up Coxwell Avenue to the Danforth then over to Woodbine Avenue to our rented flat as no electric street cars were running that night...  Not my most fondest memory for sure..."
393730,lew,2009-10-16 17:41:00,12766,"  That's quite a coincidence Norm, cause the home we were moving out of that day was on Robins Ave which runs east off Coxwell, the 1st street south of Gerrard.  You were only about 1000' away from us...........heck, you coulda stopped by and helped us pick up all our stuff that was getting scattered all around the neighborhood by hurricane"
393748,misfish,2009-10-16 19:51:00,29133,"Norm and Lew,thanks for sharing that.Unreal. My pop has told me stories about that time aswell. Wish he would share."
393774,raptorfan,2009-10-16 21:15:00,126,"This is way before my time, but it is the day my aunt was born.  I remember my grandparents talking many times over the years about the difficulties they had getting to the hospital in Paris to give birth, the flooding on the nith and the grand.  Nature has always fascinated me"
393834,Dara,2009-10-17 01:38:00,3052,"I wasn't born then, but 2 years later I was living right between Lew and Beans. I remember the storm that put the Fitz down though."
393901,oates,2009-10-17 16:28:00,151,"Been in a hurricane once, scary stuff, car feels like it will flip anytime!  Interestingly, I'm sure this event devestated river fish at the time."
