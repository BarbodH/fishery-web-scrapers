393536,Roy,2009-10-16 01:37:00,13728,I'd never seen it Joe.....spectacular shot!
393537,Greencoachdog,2009-10-16 01:38:00,8163,I'm kinda disappointed!... I thought Rocket the goat ate a puck or something.
393584,GBW,2009-10-16 03:41:00,8460,"I have seen a guy do that duing a game.  Let me tell you, when you are on D and the guy is coming in with the puck starts to spin like that you start to watch him and not the puck. Great trick for a 9-year old though."
393636,jediangler,2009-10-16 12:48:00,1923,"A 9yr old playing with 12yr olds, kinda sounds like a kid from Brantford."
393639,chuckymcd,2009-10-16 13:08:00,144,ive seen this before crazy sick tho
393642,dave524,2009-10-16 13:13:00,4508,"I remember Jason Blake doing something similar during a shootout last season, trouble is, if you are successful you are a hero, if you flub it , you look like a idiot. Gotta admit though , the kids has hands for a 9 year old."
393723,gone_fishin,2009-10-16 17:00:00,481, Blake's goal was just a spinorama... he didn't actually lift the puck up off the ice... he used that move twice last year.
393744,misfish,2009-10-16 19:38:00,29133,"Quick,Burk,sign him.  Wrong era.LOL For those that caught my mistake."
393773,aplumma,2009-10-16 21:14:00,6896,Thats wicked...I am not sure how he did it even after the 12th time I watched it.   Art
393789,Leecher,2009-10-16 22:31:00,7832,The kid's got great talent    and it's one slick move he was able to do for a  9 year old Wouldn't surprise me if we see him in the NHL..... he's got great potential!!! Leechman
