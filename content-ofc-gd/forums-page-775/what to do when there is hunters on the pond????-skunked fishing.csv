393608,Sinker,2009-10-16 06:14:00,8692," I would assume since your both hunting, you'd both have licenses, therefore, no worries about anything. The specific quote was referring to non hunting persons, talking with hunters, not hunters talking with hunters. Apples and oranges. I'm not here to argue, or lecture, and honestly, I could give a rats ass what anyone thinks. I know what I'm doing, and I play by the rules when it comes to waterfowl. I know what I'd do if I was hunting and a fisherman got a little close, and I have had it happen many times. Not once have things gone sour. I'm not out to wreck someones day of fishing, and I give fisherman the benifit of doubt when they get close to my set up. 99% of the time they keep thier distance, the other 1% just don't know any better, so a friendly chat clears things up. I could run circles around the guys fishing and spook all the fish, but why would anyone do that???  If we were to read into the acts word for word, there are way too many grey areas that could lead to a charge. Most of them require the use of common sense..........which seems to be lacking these days.  S."
393616,Handlebarz,2009-10-16 10:49:00,3790, It did not ruin my day this guy or guy's were back off the water there is a farm there and I know they were hunting just behind the cattails with no decoys in the water if I had sean them I would have gone over and talked with them. This area is also POSTED with signs saying baited area NO HUNTING of migratory birds I guess they were after crows. I should have taken a pic of the guys with the decoys set up right in front of the next sign down river.  I would not let them ruin my day unless it hit my boat then we would have had a bigger problem but that did not happen. I would also not let people like that give me the wrong idea of all hunters I know alot of the guys here and they are great and many very good friends are not fishing but hunting this time of year.
393641,misfish,2009-10-16 13:12:00,29133," Well if you read the regs,it,s elligal to have your decoys out the night before. Thats all."
393657,Jonny,2009-10-16 13:57:00,1380," Then you have even less ground to stand on.  Again I ask, what charge would a CO lay against a fisherman talking with a hunter?   But you're willing to try to lecture me on giving out what you perceive to be falsehoods.   That's all fine and dandy, and I'm sure you are an ethical hunter. But for the specific quote which I pointed out was mistaken, you're out in left field. To be honest I'm still not sure what you're thinking, as you haven't attempted to explain how you envision that a fisherman talking to a hunter could be charged with anything.  Yes there are a few areas (not so gray) where you can be charged with co-operation - i.e. a non-native hunter assisting a native or Metis hunter in big-game hunting, for example. None of them apply in the instance we are discussing."
393660,Jonny,2009-10-16 14:06:00,1380,"Nobody should be hunting in close proximity to where non-hunters routinely are (i.e. near houses, cottages, boat ramps, etc.)... period.  But just one point of clarification for non-hunters. A fact that all waterfowl hunters know is that spent pellets can shower down far from where the shot was fired (sometimes even on the hunters themselves if they shoot straight up at passing birds) but they are harmless."
393661,canadadude,2009-10-16 14:07:00,769,"Thats not true you are allowed to stop and talk with a hunter, there is no CO in Ontario that will charge you license or not. To be charged with illegaly being part of the hunt the officer will need sufficient evidence to prove you were involved. Just talking with a hunter is not grounds enough to be charged with participation.  Anyway guys, we're usually done the hunt by 9:00 am at the latest, so cut us some slack during the short waterfowl season we'll be outa the way soon enough. The days we get an all day flight are days you don't want to be out there fishing, it needs to pretty nasty out to have the birds moving all day."
393662,Guest gbfisher,2009-10-16 14:08:00,0,We are not allowed to practice native hunting rights but we can hunt with natives in season. I do every year.  We may not be able to practice their rights but we can help them retrieve animals they have taken. No matter what time of year.
393663,Guest gbfisher,2009-10-16 14:12:00,0, You can be charged with interfering with a hunt but it wouldn't happen if the hunters did not have any issue with the non hunter being there and just talking with them. Even Co's will not enter a hunting situation but instead will wait till it is over.
393669,canadadude,2009-10-16 14:30:00,769,"To be charged with interfering with a hunt stoping to talk to a hunter would not be considered a flagrant enough violation. To be carged with interfering in a hunt the person charged has to show intent, in other words the CO needs evidence that the violators intent was to disrupt a hunt, simply chatting with a hunter is not. On the other hand if you follow a hunter around and harass the hunter, this may be evidence enough for an interference charge."
393670,Jonny,2009-10-16 14:32:00,1380," I'm not going to say I'm right about this because my experience with it is limited. But I will say this...  A friend who has been part of our deer hunting group for years got his Metis status card a couple of years ago. He tells us we are not allowed to co-operate with him in deer hunting, nor he with us. We sometimes still hunt the same area at the same time but we do not camp together and he hunts completely separate from us now. As far as we know we are not even allowed to help him get a deer out of the bush that he has shot, nor have we done so.  I would suggest you check the regulations carefully again - and maybe talk to the MNR. But it's your call. For our part, we won't go near the situation with a ten-foot pole."
393671,Terry,2009-10-16 14:35:00,14456,I think as long as the hunter tells the person they are interfering with a legal hunt and to leave. anything beyond that point is a violation and can and should be charged
393679,Guest gbfisher,2009-10-16 14:50:00,0,"Jockos...""I would suggest you check the regulations carefully again - and maybe talk to the MNR. But it's your call. For our part, we won't go near the situation with a ten-foot pole.""   I have done just that. I know my rights and I know theirs as well. Call Jay Jay at the Peterborough office. He can explain it all to you. Your friend is half right. You can not hunt using his rights. You can help bring any animal out of the bush. The waste of meat gives him that right to ask for help. You just can;t shoot it is all. This is some what new legislation and has been interpreted wrong by many. Its not me who needs explaining .....  Dont let bad interpretation keep you from hunting with friends."
393699,canadadude,2009-10-16 15:31:00,769,"Sorry, not enough for a violation unless you prove he is there with the intent to disrupt the hunt."
393720,John the Fisherman,2009-10-16 16:22:00,45,"I have hunted plenty with non-status friends for moose for many years.  I pondered the same question, as did many of my friends, so one day many years ago I asked the C.O.  His reply was we can hunt all together as long as I do not ""Push"" the animal towards one of my non-status friends sitting on watch.  This is in a sense acting as a hunt guide, of which you need a license to do. Hence, Licensed Guide Services of which I am not.  As for the Metis issue I would be handling that with kid gloves because it is a New situation, and the laws regarding hunting and fishing rights for Metis people is all new in the provincial courts.  It is still ""pardon the pun"" trial and error.  The Metis Nation of Ontario really has no authority in delegating the use of fish and game for its people.  Unlike status indians with ""Treaty Rights"" these are adhered from the Federal Government.  It is the feds who decide who is status and who is not under the ""Indian Act"" for which many First Nations people have a bit of a time comprehending.  Good Hunting or Fishing.

393746,misfish,2009-10-16 19:45:00,29133,"Getting off track here. The thread was about water fowl hunters and fisherman.  Lets just leave it at,,,,,,,,,LETS GET ALONG. We love our sports and leave it at that.   Cant wait to sit in my stand Saturday FINALY. Oh,if I see a guy flipping the weeds,I,ll be yelling at ya.HAHAHAHAHA"
393758,Jonny,2009-10-16 20:30:00,1380," OK, thanks, if you're that certain then it's worth me checking further. I didn't claim to be right on this issue; I merely laid out what my understanding is. If you're right, so much the better. I'll look into is some more.   Now that doesn't inspire me with a lot of confidence, since I've run across enough CO's who don't know the right interpretation of game laws either.  What you're saying is that a non-native and a native can hunt together so long as the non-native is complying with all the regulations that apply to him (open seasons, limits, etc.). And the non-native can't shoot a deer, for example, and then claim it's the native's deer.  But the whole thing opens up a big can of worms, and gives a CO lots to speculate about. (And when CO's speculate they like to lay charges, just to be sure.)  What about fishing? A non-native and a native are fishing together on Nipissing. They have over their limit in the boat and they have fish that fall within the slot size. The native says to the CO, ""Those are my fish."" What happens next?"

393806,Jonny,2009-10-16 23:27:00,1380,"If it could be split off to another thread that would be great, but since it can't...  Threads go where they will go... like the sign says."
392459,Terry,2009-10-13 12:08:00,14456,"I have mixed feelings about this one maybe the gov. can set out a legal distance to stay away from duck hunters.. and I would think first one on site gets to use the area..  bottom line, man with gun wins argument"
392466,Jonny,2009-10-13 12:58:00,1380," Usually it does. Sometimes it doesn't. Like in a lot of things.   Yes, that works in your favour when the area is large. We used to hunt a swampy bay just off a river, and when there was boat traffic on the river that flushed up ducks there was a good chance they would come our way.    The guideline (I'm tempted to say it's a regulation but it's been so long since I checked) is 200 yards. That's between hunters, which in waterfowl hunting means that blinds or wherever hunters set themselves up should be no closer than 200 yds. Bird shot will not travel that far. But a boat out in the open can disrupt hunting at a greater range than that because waterfowl will shy away from areas where there is movement and activity."
392474,NAW,2009-10-13 13:43:00,4022,"I think both hunters and fisherman have to use common sense in these situations.  Example.  I hunt on the North river / Matchedash Bay.  The same time hunting season starts, that salmon begin running.  The first time I hunted there, I set up right on the river.   Soon after I had fisherman trolling spoons through the centre of my decoy spread.  I couldn't get mad at them, because I was taking up half the river.  I didn't know the boat traffic would be so high.  I didn't do that again.  I now set up off the beaten path, and far away from any fisherman on the river.  Like others have said.  Those hunters were there hours before you, setting up, and preparing for the hunt.  Just having fisherman in the area can wreck the entire day for the hunters (in a small pond situation).  If you see hunters, give them a large amount of distance.  They deserve it for their efforts."
393099,ch312,2009-10-15 00:45:00,1590," quite simple really....first come first serve. neither gets priority over the other. unfortunately there are many idiots (both fishermen and hunters) who seem to lack common sense...  if i were to come up to a pond/small lake with people fishing nearby id ask if they were getting anything, checkout the area for birds, and be on my merry way."
393126,Jonny,2009-10-15 01:48:00,1380,"There's something very simple of course that separates hunters and fishermen in the cold fall weather --- the hunters are usually out at dawn and dusk, but not many fishermen. When you're hunting waterfowl on small water (mostly puddle ducks), the first and last hour of daylight are the best times for activity. Other than that, it's actually a bonus for the hunters if fishermen move the ducks around a bit."
393129,Dara,2009-10-15 01:55:00,3052,"  If the hunter is already there, he is hunting. If you are just getting there, you are not fishing, you only wish you were. PS, you want to stay a lot further than the range of no 4 shot"
393374,Sinker,2009-10-15 18:22:00,8692,"Well, if I was going out duck hunting, and there was a fisherman fishing away on the same spot I wanted to hunt, I keep on truckin. I would appreciate the same common courtesy while I'm hunting. I've had plenty of fisherman come around while I was set up waiting for ducks. If they get a little close, I will motor out and let them know. I'm nice about it, and usually, they just didn't know any better and appreciate me coming out to talk.   S."
393377,fishermccann,2009-10-15 18:27:00,655,"Playing devils advocate.  Say, I drive two hours to my fav musky lake to find out that hunters are stationed all around the bays that hold fish. Am I supposed to drive away and come back when I can get another day off. The hunter can interfear with my fishing but I can't fish the lake  when he is around? Whats fair about that! I would be tempted to fish a  hundred yards out of his range no matter what it did to the ducks. He can still hunt and I can fish, fair is fair."
393398,misfish,2009-10-15 19:52:00,29133," Well said Shane. We had that happen on Little lake here. 2 hrs into daylight the fisherpeople were starting.They came close,but I stood up and waded out. Didnt need to say a word.Maybe it was the shotgun in hand.LOL Really, they knew we were hunting and were on thier way. Then theres the dinks that put thier decoys out the night before.We were set up,they arrived.We yell,someones here already,they say,our decoys are here.I say,not anymore.LOL"
393399,misfish,2009-10-15 19:54:00,29133," But ,you would be putting yourself in danger. You know they are there,you just admitted it.They were there before you."
393408,charlesn,2009-10-15 20:05:00,551," Had it happen to me a couple times.  Those hunters are usually wearing camo and being super quiet.  I'll be fishing along and next thing you know I hear gun shots real close by.  I might see them then, or sometimes I still have no idea where they are as they are so well hidden.  Hunters have to understand that fishermen that don't hunt don't know one good hunting spot from a bad one.  We are mostly just looking at the water not the surroundings.  At least speaking for myself, I am usually very unaware of my surroundings on everything above the waterline."
393424,POLLIWOGG,2009-10-15 20:56:00,835,"Just a point of interest, if you stop and talk with a hunter some CO's will consider you part of the hunt and charge you if you don't have a license."
393427,fishermccann,2009-10-15 21:04:00,655,"Being there first has nothing to do with it . I am allowed to fish that water just as much as they are to hunt it.  100 yards outside their range should not put me in danger,  unless they are going to  hunt me down while I troll back and forth with my Muskie plugs.If they do that and the cops are called who is going to be in trouble, the guys with unsafe firearms handling I would think."
393430,misfish,2009-10-15 21:13:00,29133," You miss my point. You know they are there,so why would you insist on staying there?Even if you were 100 yards from thier range.  Seems silly to me. I know if an angler was on a spot I wanted to fish,I would just be on my way.Come back when he,s not there. I guess ethics comes to mind.From both sides."
393433,fishermccann,2009-10-15 21:22:00,655,"I would want to stay there because that is where the fish are. Just because you put out a bunch of decoys does not mean you can control the lake.I share my fishing spots with other fishermen all the time we all do. I just dont think that duck hunters should be able to control how others use our resources even if they have a gun.Our  cottage lake is small, does that mean while there are hunters on it we should not fish, and no I am not anti  anything."
393435,misfish,2009-10-15 21:25:00,29133,"Well,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I did say ethics.  Happy musky plugg,n"
393453,fishermccann,2009-10-15 22:09:00,655,"I really don't know how to take that, coming from someone who removed another hunters decoys."
393572,Jonny,2009-10-16 03:03:00,1380," Uh, no, that's not correct. You would have to have a firearm, in which case you would have to produce a license. Even then however, you would still not automatically be considered part of someone else's hunt."
393586,Sinker,2009-10-16 03:52:00,8692," You seem to have a real problem with duck hunters. I remember a post from you with regards to duck blinds on ""your"" lake last year. We can all get along just fine, but when a guy comes along  with that attitude and thinks he owns the lake, it rubs us duck hunters the wrong way. We can't just pick up our gear and move to another spot like you can to fish. I have no problem with guys fishing while I'm hunting, sometimes it even helps me out. If your going to be an    about it, then you won't get any respect from me at all.  There are guys who would sit and fish in front of my decoys just to piss me off on purpose. There's nothing I can do about it, and getting angry isn't going to solve anything, so I just pour a cup of tea and take in the scenery until they're done.  In order to be charged for interfering with a lawful hunt, you would have to be waving a flag, or blowing a horn in order to scare away my birds. Just being there fishing isn't against the law, its an ethical decision made my the fisherman. If he has any ethics at all, he'll respect my space, just as I would his. I had guys fishing in front of my decoys today. I gave the guys a friendly wave, and they carried away along the shoreline casting as they went. If they were to sit in front of me, interfering with my hunt, I would go and talk to them. In most cases when fisherman are that close, they just don't understand duck hunting, and a friendly chat will usually get them moving along. I've even sent guys to better spots than in front of my blind. One time I gave a couple guys a couple waypoints to try. If I was to go out and be a tool about it,  I'm sure it would only make them want to sit there and mess up my day..................whats the point in that? I'd rather pull my gear and head home. I'm out there to enjoy the day, not argue with a fellow fisherman. Its better to give them the benifit of doubt, and have a friendly chat, than to assume they are there to screw your hunt.  There are bad apples in every group though, so sometimes both lose. I can be a real    too, but I would need my buttons pushed before I stooped to that level.  S."
393587,Sinker,2009-10-16 03:57:00,8692," I don't know where you come up with some of the stuff you post. I'm sorry if I offend you here, but you need to get your facts straight. You don't need to have a gun to be charged under the fish and game act, but it would take a real jerk of a CO to charge someone with something like that.  S."
393592,Handlebarz,2009-10-16 04:29:00,3790,I fish a area where a lot of hunters are this time of year there is a understanding that we fish down river from them and they hunt up river from the boat launch well this past weekend it could have been ugly I was sitting about 20' down river from the launch waiting for Slowpoke to get there when I heard shots from  behind me then the BB's were hitting the water 10' away from my boat I was not happy at all as these GOOFS were hunting way to close to spots that people both hunters and fisherman launch there boats from and parents have there kids at the launch to fish also if they were to shoot in the wrong direction then some people could have been hit and made things very bad.  Now for the rest of the day many boats were fishing right in front of the hunters that also did not sit well with my self (they were bugging the ones fishing up river) as we usually have no problems and if for some reason you come up on a person hunting and did not notice there decoys just keep going and wave say sorry and stay away it is just respect for each other out there we are all just trying to get away from the rest of the world and do something we can enjoy.   I hope everyone has a safe fall hunting and fishing and try to remember we are just trying to get away from the real world of working our life away and enjoy nature if ya shoot a bird or catch a fish it all a bonus.  Cheers
393595,Jonny,2009-10-16 04:32:00,1380," Lookin' for a scrap tonight are we?   What's a CO going to charge a fisherman with if he stops to talk to a duck hunter? The whole premise is ludicrous, so I'm not sure what ruffled your feathers, Sinker."
393603,Sinker,2009-10-16 05:11:00,8692,"  I'm a lover, not a fighter, Jocko.  You have be careful what your writing sometimes. There are people who really don't know, and when you post things your not sure about, they could get themselves into trouble by taking your advice. Even  worse, they could tell someone else, and get them in the same trouble. If your not sure, don't put it in writing, that's all.  If a CO wanted to be a real jerk, he could charge my son for blowing a duck call, or even retrieving a dead bird. I know, its ludicrous, but it could happen. Even taking my son out bunny hunting, and getting him to jump on the brush piles makes him involved in the hunt without a hunting license.......which in black and white is an offence. The chances of any of that happening are pretty much zero, but by the word of the law, it is an offence. I would never let it stop me from taking him out, and I would fight it tooth and nail if it ever did happen!  BTW, there is no set distance between hunters with regards to duck blinds, or fisherman. Its common sense, mixed with a bit of common courtesy. The problem is common sense and courtesy aren't so common anymore. Once either party gets upset, things go south in a hurry. We're all better off to just get along, and educate each other with a friendly conversation. What ever happened to the days when you'd see another party of hunters, and make a point of unloading and stopping for a friendly visit? These days, most people think the worste of everyone. I don't get it?? When I see a group of guys coming into the marsh I'm hunting, I'm more than happy to have a chat......there is too much attitude these days.  MrEh, the fella's that fired shot in your direction are 10% of hunters that make the other 90% of us look bad. I would NEVER fire a shot in the direction of a boat. I don't care if they're 10 yds, or 100yds from me. Those are the same guys who think they can kill ducks at 100yds, shoot birds they can't retrieve, and probably break a few other rules too. There are bad apples in every group, its the 10% of idiots who wreck it for the rest of us. I  hope it didn't ruin your day.  S."

393605,Jonny,2009-10-16 05:29:00,1380," I'm sure enough, in response to the specific quote. You're reading all kinds of things into the scenario that just aren't there. That may be what got you into lecture mode.  Again the quote:   Let's make this even more hunting specific. I'm out bird hunting and I happen across a deer hunter and stop to chat.  ""You're out for deer? What area are you covering?""  ""From the hydro line over to the big swamp.""  ""OK, I'm out for birds, and I'll make sure to stay out of your way. Good luck""  What's a CO going to charge me with?"
392216,skinny,2009-10-12 17:52:00,442,Ok was out fishing today got on the pond at 730 ish I had met up with Ultyma316 for a morning of what was to be wild fish because this time of year they are just about jumping in the boats looking for food. Well not on the pond we were at we got skunked. we tossed out all kinds of stuff and I missed 2 fish. but never did get any on the hook .  when we got on the pond I realized there was some hunters out there so we headed towards the back of the pond where I thought was no hunters  as we were going I had to go around a hunters decoy line which just about went all the way across the pond then we headed towards the back corner and discovered another hunter so we stopped we were quite a ways away from him but I don't think he liked us there   he eventualy yelled at us to find some other place to fish. we headed to the other side of the pond and fished there with no luck and I think not bugging anyone.   this brought up the question between us what is the right thing to do if you encounter hunters on a pond when fishing
392221,splashhopper,2009-10-12 18:04:00,2931,"""this brought up the question between us what is the right thing to do if you encounter hunters on a pond when fishing""  Shoot back..... but hey,,, if you don't have a gun yourself ... think again"

392248,Radnine,2009-10-12 19:27:00,1538, Congratulations! You have just realized the great intangible in fishing....the fish. They don't read the articles that we do on fall fishing (otherwise known as fall fishing advertising). We ran into the hunting thing a couple of weeks ago on Rice Lake. There was gunfire everywhere and every time you stopped the boat the calls would start. These guys blasted one about 100 yards from our boat. Then pumped about four more shells into it to get it to stop flapping (I think in the end it sunk from having about five pounds of lead in it). I never felt in danger at anytime but they did have the tip of my favourite island covered and the mouth of the Ouse river. Jim

392289,Beans,2009-10-12 21:13:00,3339,You give the guys with the guns a wide berth...forget who has the right of way...LOL
392300,vinnimon,2009-10-12 21:57:00,2593,"When your fishing in hunting season make your self present by all means.An area I fish for browns I also hunt on the same day.I make a sign at the bridge, stating that there are hunters in the area within arms reach of the creek.no quarrels.Please wear your blaze orange outfits. Came across a father and son outside of delhi, All I heard was a russel in the bush, pointed the gun low and behold it was them and not a bunch of rabbits.no flippen orange on, just flippin cammo on.They were also hunting.This is not the way to teach our kids, the importance of making ourselves  known to others and still respect other peoples areas.Just my 2 cents worth vinnimon"
392302,ChrisK,2009-10-12 22:00:00,2772,This is an ethical situation which ends up giving the right of way to the hunters. They were there hours before you setting up decoys and putting up there blinds. Lots of work involved...Also fisherman just being in the pond will ruin the bird hunters day because every bird that may come close enough to come into the decoys will turn away when they see the fisherman. Bird hunting(duck and geese)is a game of stealthy camouflage and calling in the birds as they show up on the scene. Granted it was probably to late until you noticed them there but the right thing to do would of been to exit the pond asap. If it was a larger lake you could of left the area but seeing it was a pond the right thing to do was to leave and fish somewhere else.   Cheers !!
392304,JohnF,2009-10-12 22:04:00,3494, Think of it this way - How would you deal with a skunk in yer tent? Or an alligator in yer pool?  It's hard to get any satisfaction outa being in the right while yer picking bb's outa yer butt.  JF
392306,Sinker,2009-10-12 22:12:00,8692, Well said!!!
392331,Jonny,2009-10-12 23:30:00,1380,"You had the pond to yourself all spring and summer. Now that it's hunting season, hunters have first dibs, especially if they were there before you were.  Hunting over decoys requires some undisturbed room. As a fisherman you actually have to keep away FURTHER away from a decoy set than other hunters in other blinds along the shore, because if you're tooling around in the open, while the hunters are all camo'ed and hidden, you will create such a distraction for waterfowl that any hunting on a whole pond or in a whole bay will be disrupted."
392333,Whitespinnerbait,2009-10-12 23:36:00,2038,Head to the area of the pond where all the ducks are ..you'll be safe there..most duck hunters can't hit the side of a barn at 20 yards....
392339,Greencoachdog,2009-10-13 00:02:00,8163," I disagree, hunters shouldn't be hunting a pond in the first place, but if they were... I would give them clearance, but I wouldn't leave the water! I have just as much right to fish it as they do to hunt it!... and if I scare the birds away, well that's just one for the birds.. they'll make more babies next year for the hunters to shoot at!!!      I see the Big Bad bird hunters on the lake I fish in the winter, it is a populated lake with many houses on it!... most of the waterfowl are tame on this lake and will come up to your boat for handout... they almost pets really!... would y'all like someone shooting you dog or cat in the name of the sport of hunting???  Hunters need to stick to wilderness areas, if for no other reason than if they accidently shoot someone it'll either be anouther hunter... or themelves!!!"
392342,Radnine,2009-10-13 00:04:00,1538,"I think that I am doing the hunters a favour by sticking to a traditional spot. The ducks fly over and say ""Hey, there's a guy jigging for walleye, there must not be any hunters around"" Then, blammo! Jim"
392351,danbouck,2009-10-13 00:18:00,4380,Pull up and trade some fish for a duck!
392356,Jonny,2009-10-13 00:31:00,1380," I can see we're talking apples and oranges. Where I live, the ponds are actually mostly swamp ponds, better for migratory stop-overs than fishing, and waterfowl hunting is generally done at considerable distances from populated areas, distances where the shots wouldn't even be heard. And no, the ducks and geese aren't tame; they're wary and hard to trick.  Even the situation which started this thread is unusual where I live, so it's hard to identify with your situation.  Think of those BIG BAD HUNTERS as anglers with a different kind of fishing rod.  Most of them ain't so big or so bad."
392375,[email protected],2009-10-13 01:13:00,290, Yeah. These guys had no aim at all.  Like 5 hours worth of shooting and they didnt get a single bird
392378,JEREMY,2009-10-13 01:24:00,300,I think i know what pond you are talking about and would think that it is too close to the road to be hunting.
392417,ch312,2009-10-13 03:17:00,1590,  if people were hunting on a pond and you put your boat in disrupting their hunt you could be fined. many people dont understand that its against the law to disrupt any hunting activities and scaring birds away would fall under that category.  hunters need to stick to wilderness areas? many people hunt on big lakes as well as small back lakes and ponds where people also fish. hunters shouldnt hunt there because someone may want to wet a line there too?>
392422,CLofchik,2009-10-13 03:50:00,854," Uh, the exact same part of the Act applies to fishing as well.  So how dare your hunting activities interfere with anybody that wants to fish the same pond!  Really common courtesy should just apply to how much elbow room you give a hunter, common courtesy generally being the range of #4 shot from the hunters location!"
392456,dave524,2009-10-13 11:55:00,4508,"I've had a situation were anglers were actually beneficial on bigger water and respected the area of our set. They kept bumping into birds while fishing, keeping them moving long after they would have settled in for the day. Sometimes the birds they bumped would hit our spread"
