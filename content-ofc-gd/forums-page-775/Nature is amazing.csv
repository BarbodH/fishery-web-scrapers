These are all sounds this bird has picked up while construction was going on nearby.  Sounds exactly like the real thing.  1. Hammer 2. Chainsaw 3. Jack hammer 4. Lawn mower hitting sticks 5. Leaf blower starting 6. Power drill 7. Wood saw 8. Human voices 9. Two-way radio 10.Worker whistling He makes lots of different bird calls as well. What can you hear  "
