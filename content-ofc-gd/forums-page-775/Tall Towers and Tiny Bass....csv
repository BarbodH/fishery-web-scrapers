So I finally bit the bullet and had an 85 FOOT tower put up so I could get a decent wireless internet package.  $3300.00 later for the tower, and I'll still have slower internet than most of you city guys, but my life will no doubt me much easier and I'll be enjoying much faster and more reliable internet.    This guy was nuts, he put up one section, then crawled up and hoisted up the next 8 foot section and bolted it on.    Afterwards, my wife had to head out for a couple of hours to a baby shower with the kids so I figured what better way to cheer myself, and my suddenly much lighter wallet up, than to hit up a local creek for late season bass.      When I got down to the creek my usual water was totally void of weed or structure of any sort, but I still managed a half dozen of these little guys in about and hour of fishing.  Would have had a 5 bag limit running about 1.5 lbs but it's better than nothing.  Enjoy your weekends - Cheers, Ryan"

394141,The Urban Fisherman,2009-10-18 19:06:00,2050," It could very well be a Delhi Tower.... I know the installer bought it locally, and marked it up some no doubt! lol  There's a 4' square slab holding it in place - should be good to go.  I thought about doing it myself at one time, but I didn't want to chance doing something wrong and having somebody get hurt.... and this way if something did ever happen, I believe the installer would be more liable than myself...  Anyways, nice to know your tower is holding up well.  Cheers, Ryan"

394154,Terry,2009-10-18 20:50:00,14456,"that's how you put up a tower, one section at a time  put up more then a few myself, real nice self-supporting tower, should last a real long time. so are you with Xplornet now or did you put up tower to get a different provider...."
