394191,pikeie,2009-10-19 00:00:00,380,"well looks like im goin fishin on caribou lake on tuesday. I know that there are some nice walleye in that lake, but ive never fished it so i am just lookin for some places to fish. And i know they will be in deeper water at this time of year... so any help would be appreciated!  Thanks Matt"
394198,pike slayer,2009-10-19 00:15:00,1177,there was a blue algie warning in that lake not to long ago. its decent fishing in there. ive done better for bass and pike in that lake. pm me if you like matt.

Though blooms can occur all year (even under the ice) its is unlikely there is an active bloom at this point.  Not very familiar with the lake but some people do well for walleye. From what I understand the weed edges go quite away out from shore."
