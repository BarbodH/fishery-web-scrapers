393320,bigbuck,2009-10-15 15:44:00,2449,"They are nice, that's for sure. I love my Curado 300E and my next muskie reel will probably be another ABU."
393356,gone_fishin,2009-10-15 17:27:00,481,i've been eyeing the Toro since it came out... the 60HS WILL be my next musky reel for sure!
393489,Rizzo,2009-10-16 00:08:00,4754,"what's the retail cost on these reels? My wife may need a Christmas ""suggestion"""
393542,Guest steel'n'esox,2009-10-16 01:50:00,0,"Cost for the Revos is just under the 400.00 mark, I believe Rollie and Helens musky shop has them for around 300.00US,"
393544,backbay,2009-10-16 01:55:00,773,I see LeBaron has the Toros on for under $270. Is it too early for Christmas?
393647,Rizzo,2009-10-16 13:25:00,4754,"ouch too pricey, better buy that one myself and not tell the wife!"
393648,Raf,2009-10-16 13:30:00,3495,"check out the quantum cabo cbc30(1)pts if you're looking for a low-pro muskie type reel.  have been using two of them for a couple of years rizzo.  a lil cheaper than the curados and revo.  i wouldn't use it to pull double 13s blades but it works for just about everything else; great for jerkbaits, topwaters."
393768,Rizzo,2009-10-16 21:06:00,4754,double 13's?? will the madness never end? Why not hook up a couple of frisbees!
393770,backbay,2009-10-16 21:10:00,773,"hmmm, do those come in a nickel finish?"
