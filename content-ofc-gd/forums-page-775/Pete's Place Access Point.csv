393281,Raf,2009-10-15 14:00:00,3495,Does anyone know the status of it post-thanksgiving?  Is it open to the public or does the park shut it down?
393342,BITEME,2009-10-15 16:30:00,1968,Wish I could help Raf dont even know where it is
393346,Roy,2009-10-15 16:51:00,13728,"I don't know either Raf. Maybe if you give this number a call:  Pete's Place boat launch. Address: Near | Parry Sound, ON Tel: 1 705 378-0685"
393524,Cast-Away,2009-10-16 01:17:00,790,"Raf, here is the phone number for Oasler PP who are in charge of the Masassauga, they should be able to tell you. 705-378-2401"
393531,backbay,2009-10-16 01:24:00,773,"You probably know this, but I don't think you'd have a problem launching at the Moon River marina, Raf."
393535,Cookslav,2009-10-16 01:36:00,1457," Yup,  They stay open late for the hunting crowd. $20 to launch though... We technically $10 in, and another $10 to come out"
393574,bridge,2009-10-16 03:07:00,54,it was open the weekend before thanks givin.  i think the sign said it is open till later in the year.  i'm willing to admit i'm wrong though if its not.  the mind was a little fuzzy that weekend.
