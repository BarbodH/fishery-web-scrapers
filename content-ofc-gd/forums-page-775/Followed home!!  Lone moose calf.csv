393149,Rustic-Fisher,2009-10-15 02:24:00,826,"Out grouse hunting today and on the way out of the bush we round a corner and find this in the middle of the trail.  We back up and give her TONS of space thinking mom has gotta be near plus my Jeep is brand new and I would like to keep it that way lol. We back up, it follows.......100 yrds She stayed with us awhile and than after some horn honking wondered back into the bush.   Never have I seen such a thing, anyone else? Mom was no where to be found.  Oct 19th is just around the corner, hope she smartens up..lol    RF"

393163,DRIFTER_016,2009-10-15 02:55:00,10439,Had this 2 year old walk right up to me in 2003. I had to back up as I didn't know what it was up to. It got as close as 5 feet before backing off to about 15 feet.  
393167,cram,2009-10-15 03:03:00,1733,"You shoulda brought it home :-).   Lots of people have domesticated them...i believe genghis kahn or alexander hte great used them to go through northern bush....faster/more endurance than a horse (through the bush), believe it or not."
393226,12footspringbok,2009-10-15 10:55:00,459,"Interesting pics. If i had to guess, i'd say mom's probably hiding out.... in someones freezer."
393263,anders,2009-10-15 12:59:00,1168,"Had that happen once with a spiker on our way fishing...not that close, but after we put him in the bush we drove away, when we turned around, he was back on the road behind the vehicle, and wouldnt leave...was walkin around the truck trying to figure out what we were  thanks for the pics...what an amzaing and good looking animals eh!"
393268,Guest gbfisher,2009-10-15 13:04:00,0,well...what would you do if you were lost and ran into a couple that werent lost. Follow them no doubt.!
393269,highdrifter,2009-10-15 13:04:00,2534,"Ya I hear they make great pets!!  Poor thing..  If momy was shot, the humane thing would have been to wait for baby and dispatch it too.  cheers HD"
393290,canadadude,2009-10-15 14:23:00,769,"The cows shooo away the calfs just before and during the rut, moma must have given this guy the boot so she can go out and find Bullwinkle for some fun!!!1"
393311,Leecher,2009-10-15 15:13:00,7832,"Awesome pics Rustic-Fisher And to answer your question, no  but had a grousse once that just did not want to go away while I was ice fishing.... funniest thing to see Leechman"
393329,Roy,2009-10-15 16:00:00,13728,Great pics RF. My favourite moose follow clip though is this one.I think it was Randy from Sturgeon who posted it here a month or two back.  http://www.aventure-chasse-peche-video.com...al-vivant#video
393429,Hellfish,2009-10-15 21:11:00,308,"That is truly amazing both the pics and the video, i had a run in with a group of mountain goats in Golden BC but that is common there apparently"
393437,redneck666,2009-10-15 21:29:00,563,"yep! this one right here... in my backyard... im in the city, just on the edge. and this thing got chased from the steel plant by my uncle, and after that a bunch of chaos insued with cops not knowing what the hell they were doing. anyway we had to follow this thing up and down the street for a bit to get a decent picture and then had to tell the cops what to do.  "
393443,BUSTER,2009-10-15 21:42:00,1336,"great pics,  i blame the poor eye sight"

393714,canadadude,2009-10-16 16:08:00,769,"This is probably what is going on, when the cow moose comes into esterus it chases away the calph and goes looking for the Bull, I think this is natures way of keeping calph moose away from horny rutting Bulls. After the cycle the two will reunite."
393718,canadadude,2009-10-16 16:11:00,769,I'm sure mommy moose was not killed she's just out getting laid so next year she'll have another little guy to take care of.
393725,Roy,2009-10-16 17:07:00,13728, You're not paying attention Randy.
