393173,huey graphite,2009-10-15 03:29:00,362,"A long time ago I recall reading on OFC what I think was a fisherman's prayer or something similar.  Kind of ""I fish therefore I am"" statement. The only lines I can remember read something like..... ""Fishing is not something I do, it is something that I am"" and ""Once you understand this, you will understand me""  A little vague I know....but if you can help me find this verse, it would be much appreciated.   Thanks,   HG"
393184,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-10-15 03:46:00,0,"i grew up fishing at a camp that had this on the wall:  Fisherman's Prayer  God grant that I may live to fish  For another shining day,  But when my final cast is made  I then most humbly pray,  When nestled in your landing net  As I lay peacefully asleep,  You'll smile at me and judge  That I'm ""good enough to keep."""
393198,Seeker,2009-10-15 04:46:00,7,"I am a fisherman for life. I will always be a fisherman. It is not something I do, it is who I am.  Fishing is not an escape. It is where I belong, where I am supposed to be.  It is not a place, but a lifelong journey. It is a passage my father showed me, and that I will show to others.  When you understand all of this, you will know me, and we will fish together.  Author Unknown "

393350,mpt,2009-10-15 16:58:00,158,"OOOPs, Sorry I meant this....  Oh Lord.... There he is... it feels like a big one.... please don't let me lose him... I've ever caught one this big befoe I promise not to horse him and if I land him I promise to release him... and make a graphite replica if my wife says it's ok. Thank you for the rapalas... Amen"

393357,Harrison,2009-10-15 17:31:00,2202,"Lord, as I travel miles out into the lake, In search of the bounty you so graciously did create. Watch over me should my $15,000 motor die once more, And grant me enough gas to blow myself to shore."
393455,huey graphite,2009-10-15 22:16:00,362,Haha! Al very good.
393463,Greencoachdog,2009-10-15 22:54:00,8163,"Early to bed,  Early to rise,  Fish like hell,  and make up lies!!!  That's the fishermans motto... I just thought I'd throw it out there."
