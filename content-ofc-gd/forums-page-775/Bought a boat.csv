It needs a little bit of work but i figure its a good winter project.  Anyone ever heard of this boat before ive tried to look it up and cant find too much info on it.  A buddy and me went halves on it $800.00 for boat motor and Trailer I think its a good deal tho.  sorry i dont have any pics yet as we just picked it up yesterday!  I will keep everyone updated on the transformation  Thanks in advance  Chuck"
