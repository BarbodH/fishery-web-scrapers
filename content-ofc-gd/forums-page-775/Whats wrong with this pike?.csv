393637,LucG,2009-10-16 12:48:00,779," Oh there was a texture, almost as if it was covered in poppy seeds."
393656,TC1OZ,2009-10-16 13:57:00,987,"Fish acne is not to be mocked, maybe he'll grow out of it, maybe he'll get some proactive."
393677,Dutchy,2009-10-16 14:44:00,416," Not all parasites cause animals or fish to be unhealthy, mainly parasites that infect the gut do that. All frogs have nematode worms in their liver, lungs and gut."
393709,Guest Behnam,2009-10-16 15:58:00,0,I think you have to contact MNR!
393716,LucG,2009-10-16 16:09:00,779, ...and tell them what? I caught a pike 3 months ago with black spots.
393728,PikeMolester,2009-10-16 17:25:00,428,"I just read an article in Musky Hunter magazine about something like this. Its probably lymphosarcoma which is a malignant blood cancer that is highly contagious among esox. Symptoms are red skin lesions, sores and tumors which ultimately will kill the fish."
393732,Raf,2009-10-16 17:58:00,3495,it's not lymphosarcoma  
393734,Headhunter,2009-10-16 18:05:00,5703,"Well, after seening that pic Raf, I'm not sure which of the two would taste better! On the bright side, that open wound would certainly help save some time scaling the fish! HH"
393797,Kerry,2009-10-16 23:05:00,383,"Caught one a few years ago about half as bad, unfortunately it didn't survive and I kept it.Surprisingly after cleaning it I found no black spot whatsoever in the flesh.It was fine just all in the skin. I think that one would go back regardless though.  Kerry"
393805,steverowbotham,2009-10-16 23:26:00,1800,That's black grub and the worst case of it i have ever seen
393812,Jonny,2009-10-16 23:34:00,1380,Can you imagine having that itch and no way to scratch it?
393253,LucG,2009-10-15 12:45:00,779,I was going through some of my summer fishing pics and I comletey forgot to post these.  I caught him in a small river going into Nip. in about the middle of July.  Looks like he is infested with some sort of parasite.    
393259,anders,2009-10-15 12:50:00,1168,thats is ugly...i dont know if i would have touched it
393261,Headhunter,2009-10-15 12:54:00,5703,"How'd it taste?  Doesn't seem to be bothered by it, the Pikes got a smile on it's face in the first pic! HH"
393262,fisherman7,2009-10-15 12:59:00,325,Looks like he fought a pepper mill and lost!
393264,blaque,2009-10-15 13:00:00,2419,Dude thats nauseating! Put a warning in the title for guys trying to eat a bagel...........Yeeeeeeeeeoooooowwwwwkkk!
393284,Fisherpete,2009-10-15 14:01:00,1814,"Mmmmmm.... p-p-peppery p-p-poppyseed p-p-pike.....  Looks like a severe case of blackspot. You see it on perch sometimes, and I have seen some pretty bad cases on pike from Lake Dalrymple."
393293,Spiel,2009-10-15 14:29:00,9065,"Definitely a heavy infestation of Black Grub. Mmmmmm, yummy!"
393302,BassAsin,2009-10-15 14:53:00,806,"thats nasty man, no other way to say it"
393304,Leecher,2009-10-15 14:58:00,7832,Yuck that is gross     did you put it out of it's misery?? Leechman
393305,LucG,2009-10-15 15:01:00,779," No, I though about it though."
393308,basskicker09,2009-10-15 15:07:00,144,it is a parisite that comes from a fish being in warm or hot water for long periods of time actually when fishing perch in the niagara region with my father (bigugli) we catch tones of perch that look like that through the ice i will try and find a pic of one of them but it looked just like that but it was BLUE i have never seen a blue perch in my life
393317,BITEME,2009-10-15 15:32:00,1968,did you clean your hands before you touched your rod again
393323,irishfield,2009-10-15 15:52:00,26272,"""No slip tape""... makes them easy to hold !"
393349,LeXXington,2009-10-15 16:57:00,1928, 
393373,wallyboss,2009-10-15 18:22:00,1095,Looks like a teenaged pike with an acne problem.
393417,BUSTER,2009-10-15 20:42:00,1336,"ahh ,, pass the ketchup~!"
393420,redneck666,2009-10-15 20:47:00,563,"man, that is one ugly creature!"
393423,blaque,2009-10-15 20:50:00,2419,"THanks LucG.......however, having to come back in here to thank you, i had to bypass that disgusting fish again. This time i was downing a Whopper Jr."
393449,splashhopper,2009-10-15 22:00:00,2931, I don't care what that link says about EATING that fish... I ain't doing it
393475,vinnimon,2009-10-15 23:39:00,2593,its parents were first cousins
393482,Rizzo,2009-10-15 23:49:00,4754,"whatever that is, its a pretty severe case of it. Maybe should have taken a bit of sandpaper to the little guy"
393538,Cookslav,2009-10-16 01:40:00,1457,Unprotected mating...
393547,Skud,2009-10-16 02:00:00,739,Caught a pike in Doe Lake a month ago that was almost that bad in appearance. Very healthy though.
393597,mojobass,2009-10-16 04:36:00,34, LOL That's a good one. I wonder what happens if you eat it?
393606,EC1,2009-10-16 05:39:00,930,"That thing gives me the goosebumps everytime I look at it....I think I would have given it my hook instead of touching it at all. BTW, when touched, is there a texture to it or no?"
