393747,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-10-16 19:48:00,0,"while off work, the honey do list picks up the slack. hopefully fishing tomorrow morning somewhere."
393769,aplumma,2009-10-16 21:07:00,6896,  Gee and that is before you figure that The rocker was a full blow alternative lifestyler (not that their is anything wrong with that)(just so I can be politically correct).... but man could he sing.   Art
393771,aplumma,2009-10-16 21:10:00,6896, No alcohol but you might need a shot of penicillin after Dawg gets done.   Art
393780,Tybo,2009-10-16 22:00:00,1373,"Hold fast; Build a rack for the boat and store your gear as close to the cab as possible. Get some used snows on all 4. It will be like driving a new truck. A Friend and I would back country to some lakes. That only been named recently. It,s harder to load/unload,but it will make a world of difference on the truck."
393782,Terry,2009-10-16 22:03:00,14456,Yeah well  My dodge dakota will go anywhere      if you tow it
393787,Tybo,2009-10-16 22:16:00,1373,"Thats not true Terry. It will go into the snow bank,red lights,ditchs,etc,etc."

393564,holdfast,2009-10-16 02:40:00,1813,"All I can say is that I wish I had that Nissan over my 99 Ford Ranger.  I would of never made the start point at the Bottom of the Hill.  Its snowing now, the Last two weeks Record Lows, Farmers are Taking a Huge hit. This is when they should be thrashing.  Tomorrow plus 6, and Saturday plus 14.  I would have more confidence in that Pathfinder, going up the trail that I hope to fish Saturday  than using my Ranger that made it when the trail was dry.  By the way, I have a small dog, small truck, the Pathfinder is macho enough for me.   "
393571,Greencoachdog,2009-10-16 03:01:00,8163,"  Don't want to ""bad mouth"" you Holdie, but I don't really consider a Ranger as a truck... kinda like a little car without a trunk lid! Their handling on dry land is less than desireable for me... rain, snow, and ice only compound the less than desireable factors!"
393576,Dara,2009-10-16 03:11:00,3052,Now them little Toyotas from the 80's and 90's would go places...put a lift kit and some rubber on them and you had a machine that would do some boondocking
393581,Seeker,2009-10-16 03:28:00,7," Agree.  As my father in law says, ""the right combination of light, height and fight."""
393582,BassAsin,2009-10-16 03:31:00,806,"Am i the only one who laughed his balls off at the ""nice moustache"" line?  Thanks doc"
393585,GBW,2009-10-16 03:46:00,8460,"nope, me too.  As for Nissan's, I had a 1985 2WD king cab pickup and that thing took a BEATING!  I mean, hill climbs, distance jumps, jumps when all you are after us as much height as you can get.  You name it other then a smash up derby my old 85 did it.  Gave it to my cousin at 255,000KM and he put another 140 on it before it died.  It only died because he did the work on it and didn't replace a gasket 100% so it spit fuel and light fire when driving.  It was a good old girl..."
393588,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-10-16 04:10:00,0,"i'm glad some of you actually watched the video despite people trying to derail my thread.  about the mustache...the night before we went to a halloween party...his costume was freddie mercury! clearly after several wobbly pops and waking up at 6 am, shaving is on the bottom of the priority list...but man, all day, none of us could even look at him...it looked like a squirrel pelt across his lip..."
393589,GBW,2009-10-16 04:12:00,8460,"post a better pic then, HAHAHAHA"

393591,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-10-16 04:25:00,0,my truck made it up the hill fine.  *cough*  
393593,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-10-16 04:30:00,0,"i should mention that i also drive a pathfinder, and that the point of this video was more the shame of not making it up the hill, and of course the mustache comment for those who watched it to the end.  how embarrassing is it to have your friends watch as you fail?"
393594,holdfast,2009-10-16 04:30:00,1813," I Take Offense in what you say, STOP BAD MOUTHING ME other wise Im hitting the MOD Panic Button.  That is if I can find it.  My Ford Ranger Rocks, oil pan leak 75,999 KM, 3 x warning sensor replacements including the sensor for the sensor etc etc"
393599,Greencoachdog,2009-10-16 04:45:00,8163,  I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings son... come here and let Daddy put some ninny on it for you...
393600,holdfast,2009-10-16 04:49:00,1813," Yea, it is embarrassing to fail, but then again, I love a guy that has failed and can pick himself up.  Kind of reminds me of someone and the friends he has hung around with.  Was the Pathfinder squirming and shimming going up that steep incline?  My Ranger will just, well, slide"
393601,holdfast,2009-10-16 04:52:00,1813," Is there alcohol involved?  If there is, Im not allowed."
393629,BITEME,2009-10-16 12:32:00,1968,poo now I gotta get coffee out of my keyboard again
393634,mbac31,2009-10-16 12:46:00,904,"  I dont know if its just me or does something seem wrong with a bunch of guys and a giant moustache  going to a lake called ""Gangbang Lake"""
393638,blaque,2009-10-16 12:49:00,2419," How many times during the course of the night did you hear........""Uh, what exactly are you supposed to be"" I would have liked to hear some of the guesses LOL"
393645,holdfast,2009-10-16 13:19:00,1813,"Just a suggestion, I wouldnt be going to any Bar that I know of in Saskatchewan, especially Big River as your buddy would be lucky just to be laughed at.  Im still laughing at the picture.   Thanks."
393646,Raf,2009-10-16 13:23:00,3495,sez the guy with a pink ranger  
393649,Nemo,2009-10-16 13:32:00,727,Ouch !!
393655,troutologist,2009-10-16 13:56:00,951,"Ya Dave should take some driving course or something. The 1 wheel peel mazda made it up there a few times. Including a Bo Duke style culvert jump in front of a camp of tree planters.  Motorhead was a factor...    I'll jump in on the name of the lake. Since one of our best lakes got too much traffic all decent lakes, ponds etc are renamed. Search gangbang song by kenny cheecho on you tube."
393704,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-10-16 15:37:00,0,"  this was actually station road, but i have complete faith even the old red toyota corolla you used to drive would have performed better than dave's smashfinder."

393727,troutologist,2009-10-16 17:15:00,951,Dude why are you at home? Shouldn't you be fishing everyday with no work?
393460,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-10-15 22:41:00,0,A buddy of mine insists his pathfinder can go where full size trucks can... listen for the sound of plastic bumper on rock..  nsfw due to cussin'  
393461,OhioFisherman,2009-10-15 22:46:00,6623,Nissan? like no sand?
393471,vinnimon,2009-10-15 23:14:00,2593,MY cherokee floats on what pathfinders sink in.
393472,Fisherman,2009-10-15 23:16:00,7201,"Maybe ya have to look twice and see that the Chev keeps both front tires on the rock surface, the Nissan just goes a bit too far to the right and his left front tire is off the rock on his first attempt which causes the loss of ground clearance...a no brainer."
393478,sturgman,2009-10-15 23:46:00,249,  What he said!!
393484,Pope29,2009-10-15 23:54:00,29,cmon...I could drive my wifes Saturn Sedan up those rocks. That dude should be ashamed to have to take two cracks at that. Pathfinders are awesome reliable trucks....till the frame rots out of them
393490,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-10-16 00:10:00,0,seems most of y'all missed the point.  all we're supposed to be doing here is laugh at the EPIC FAIL that was his attempt at offroading after talking a lot of bull about his truck.
393491,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-10-16 00:12:00,0,  this vid doesn't really do the steepness of the hill justice.  your wifes saturn is better off where it is...blocking your boat from getting out of the driveway!
393493,Daplumma,2009-10-16 00:16:00,1961,We usually miss the point here with you doc.We are just not so clever as you.We can only hope to get as smart as you one day.
393499,vinnimon,2009-10-16 00:22:00,2593,"pathfinders are excelent trucks, even when they rot out they still go.by the way is this a fishing forum or something else.truck tech here heelo!lets talk fishing shall we."

393511,danbouck,2009-10-16 00:59:00,4380,This post will go downhill as fast as the Nissan.  Thanks for the laugh Dr.!
393514,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-10-16 01:01:00,0,pretty sad day when i have people following me around trying to pick fights because they don't like my opinions. this was just supposed to be a funny post about my friends crappy truck!
393516,Daplumma,2009-10-16 01:04:00,1961,"Nice edit after calling me a loser.Guess name calling is OK if you are doc.What name did I call you?I will say you have me pegged...Soy un perdedor.Just ask around here,most think I'm a loser for sure."
393519,Daplumma,2009-10-16 01:05:00,1961,You reap what you sow..get a clue..I speak for more people than you think.
393520,Pigeontroller,2009-10-16 01:08:00,2793,"Thats more about driving skill, or lack there of, than Chevy vs. Nissan.  I wanna know where Gangbang Lake is???"
393522,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-10-16 01:12:00,0,"  While my opinions aren't always popular, at least they are found in context within a thread. All you are doing is trying to start trouble. Your people can speak for themselves."
393539,vinnimon,2009-10-16 01:41:00,2593,almost sounded like the tranny/tourque conv went for a crap. Had a transfer case blow while towing a heavy boat. conditions not far different.laughing about it now but not then.I hear where your coming from doc.youll joke about it later
393543,Daplumma,2009-10-16 01:51:00,1961,Like I said.get a clue.People have spoken.Read AND comprehend what you read after you post.There are concequences to opinions.Sometimes people think you are a an ass for what you say..Imagine that!
