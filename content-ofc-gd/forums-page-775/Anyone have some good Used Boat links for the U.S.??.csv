393898,mark02,2009-10-17 16:13:00,27,"Try www.boats.com Three years ago I picked up a 2001 Lund Mr. Pike, 115 Yamaha 4 stroke, Eagle Trailer, Minnkota, sonar, etc. for $11 000 (that's with exchange).  Taxes were extra at the border; paid by VISA.  No problems coming back.  The customs guy at Niagara Falls looked jealous but congratulated me anyway. Canadian Tire did a free trailer inspection (required by Ministry of Transportation). I saw similar used rigs in Canada asking $25 000.  I bought it through a Maryland marina so I had all the proper paperwork.  Round trip from Toronto to Baltimore was 18 hours.  Add $70 for an overnight stay in a motel.  A year later I picked up a brand new 9.9 Yamaha kicker in Kalamazoo, Michingan for $1450 off Ebay.  Ask me if I like shopping in the States."
