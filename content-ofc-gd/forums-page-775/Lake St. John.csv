393569,muskymike,2009-10-16 02:56:00,772,are you looking for a restaurant? or a launch?
393617,mbac31,2009-10-16 11:02:00,904,  Go down Rama Road and you can Launch at the Trailer Park if you want. You cn Launch at Lonford or off Airport Road. Lonford is probally the best. You will see it going down Rama Road pass the Casino and keep going till you see where the new pavement starts and you will see longford on the right. Then take that road to the end. You will see the launch.  Maybe you will catch lunch

393702,ohhenrygsr,2009-10-16 15:35:00,947,Depending on the size of your boat the free launch of the south end is a lil Skitchy.  But i have seen a 18ft Lund launch with a truck.  If in doubt you can head to the trailer park it's number 7199 and is it ever a trailer park.  The launch is awesome with docks just a steep hill getting to the launch.  They charge $15
393703,ohhenrygsr,2009-10-16 15:36:00,947,Oh yea to get to the south launch you turn right where you see the Stephan plant sign and just keep going straight over the tracks
393708,bigugli,2009-10-16 15:54:00,6138,"Stop in at the Casino. Used to have a great all you can eat.  maybe you can ""Reel"" in the big one while you're there"
393719,Guest Johnny Bass,2009-10-16 16:21:00,0,Up Rama road.Go past the airport and turn right at the 'T' in the road.Go along a couple hundred meters and it's on your left. It is deep enough to launch your boat. And there is a little Island you can go to for lunch.lol I hope the boat has been treating you well.

394241,stan_133,2009-10-19 01:48:00,77, The boat has been treating me quite well all season long. I'm really glad that that i decided to buy the boat. i'm hoping that i can get a few more outing out of it this year before the season ends. thanks
