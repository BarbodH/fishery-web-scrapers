392672,knightfisher,2009-10-13 21:41:00,237,"Hi Lew,  Sounds like you had a great relaxing time.  Lakefield is a great choice.  I spend alot of time in and around that town each summer.. Numerous K-Lakes just minutes from there. Thought of moving up there as well, but have not made that decision yet. Glad to hear your doing it Lew. You spent enough years in the concrete jungle.  Best of luck,  Dan  "
392680,pigeonfisher,2009-10-13 21:54:00,696,Welcome back Lew.  Sounds like you have had a great summer and have great plans to look forward to.  Lakefield is beautiful.

392732,lew,2009-10-13 23:44:00,12766,"Thanks everyone, it was indeed a great summer.  I seldom take musky pictures anymore and post them here even less often so I'll not be making any fishing reports.   I'll be fishing with Pete again Mike and will arrive early on the Saturday morning, so I'll see you & the rest of the gang then.   Sorry Ron, but I'm done for the year up there, but will be back in May. Unfortunately, all my fishing trips this year messed up my plans for the meetings as I was away for the last 3 but will hopefully make up for it next year."
392733,bucktail,2009-10-13 23:50:00,1857,Nice to have you back Lew!!! I was just thinking yesterday at this time....it's about time Lew showed up with this seasons catches!!!

392782,Squid,2009-10-14 01:46:00,1656,"Gotta tel ya, Lew is a great net man! just kidding. Glad you and Di made it back safe and sound Lew. Lets talk through the week."

392848,BITEME,2009-10-14 11:16:00,1968,Welcome Back LEW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
392864,Headhunter,2009-10-14 12:48:00,5703,Welcome back Lew... I must say that I was pleased reading your report to find that you had a rather un-eventful summer and that you got to relax. Un-eventful compared to some other summers... just what the doctor ordered. HH
392868,Beans,2009-10-14 12:53:00,3339,Good to have you back Lew...You've been missed !
392873,Greencoachdog,2009-10-14 13:00:00,8163,"I'ts great to have you back Lew!!!  It sounds like you had a wonderful summer, you and your wife deserve it!!!  You sure have decked that boat out real nice and purdy!!!  I understand about the fishing reports, but let us know if you catch a really big one eh!"
392889,Pigeontroller,2009-10-14 13:47:00,2793,"Good to see you back,  happy to hear your summer was excellent, and you're enjoying the new ship!"
392892,Tom McCutcheon,2009-10-14 13:56:00,627,Good to hear you had a great summer Lew. We sure missed your BIG SMILE at our summer meetings. I have a T shirt for you that I will hang onto till I see you again.  Tom.
392994,ScugogBoy,2009-10-14 19:19:00,36,"Mr Lew..very nice boat and summer cottage (but I have to ask....does ""Bubbles"" live next door?......  ) I'm fairly new on this board and wonder why you won't post pictures of the muskies you say you catch? Was it a bad summer for catching or is it a personal thing about taking pictures? Anyhow.....enjoy your trailer and new boat....look forward to maybe meeting you (shoot me a PM...hook up with me if you like on Scugog...I have house on the water and can show you my tricks for getting Musky to hit live bait suspended under a ""big slip float"")....or even better we can land some pickeral from my dock and enjoy a feed and a few cold ones."
393017,Pigeontroller,2009-10-14 20:38:00,2793,"  Being ""new"", you haven't seen the many Muskie pics Lew has posted. Its part of the evolution of being a Muskie hunter, when you start off you take pics of every fish, and post 'em. As the years go by and you catch more and hopefully bigger fish, you take less pics..."
393023,Roy,2009-10-14 21:02:00,13728,I don't recall numbers of muskies for specific years but it's safe to say that Lew has caught and posted more muskies on this board than most people will ever catch in their lifetime.
393048,musky_man,2009-10-14 22:47:00,159,"Lew,  Glad that things went well ... in 6-24 months (max) I'll be taking a page out of your book.  Stay in touch and good luck with the house sale -- great trime to be selling!  Mark"
393071,mistyriver1,2009-10-14 23:52:00,600," What's wrong with a side consol boat ?    The crestliner has treated me very well Lew.  Thanks for leaving some of that ""karma"" with it.  As I've told you before, I'm very happy with it.  Glad you guys had a great summer.  Jim"
393197,snag,2009-10-15 04:43:00,1932,"Ohhhhhh Lew,  It's not fair.  Retirement is sooooooo far away.   Cangrats!   NOW,  Is it: orange and black or Black and orange?  you have a lifetime to decide.................."
393202,camillj,2009-10-15 05:36:00,1988,Welcome back bud ... been a long time and more than once I wondered how you were faring... was hoping you were having a good summer ... sounds like your turn to relax and enjoy finally came round - you deserve it !  By the way nice ride - if you ever need a net man you know where I'm at
393445,ehg,2009-10-15 21:44:00,2666,"Nice to see you around Lew, you always add wisdom and class here."
393446,JPD,2009-10-15 21:46:00,296,"Welcome back Lew, glad you're enjoying the boat!"
392593,lew,2009-10-13 19:02:00,12766,"Howdy all  My wife and I headed for our little hideaway in the Kawarthas early last May and we just got home last night after the best summer either of us have ever had. We spent the last 5 months just enjoying life, laying around being lazy and a fair amount of travelling. Infact, so far this season I've towed the new boat 2500 miles to different fishing locations.  As usual, I spent 7 days at Lakair on the West Arm of Nippissing with the OFC gang in June, then Diane & I, along with our best friends of 35 years, went back up to Lakair again in July and rented a cabin for another week and had a fantastic time.  In August, Diane & I along with 3 other couples rented 4 cabins at Memquisit Lodge, also on the West Arm and had another absolutely excellent week.  Squid & I also fished Quinte in May, the Ottawa River in July and the St. Lawrence the beginning of October.  I""ve had a great musky season so far, although I haven't landed any real bruiser yet this year, but we've still got a couple months to go yet.  My one big project I had this summer was to put a roof over my deck at the lake and it turned out pretty good. I put louvered blinds all around so now when it rains we can stay outside and still enjoy the fresh air.    I spent a huge amount of time in the new Skeeter and absolutely everything about it is excellent and I don't have a single complaint about anything. It handles big rough water with ease and the smooth ride of the fiberglass far exceeds any aluminum boat I've ever owned. The 150 HP Yamaha pushes the boat at 51 MPH (83 KPH) and the hydraulic steering is effortless, even at WOT. Sure is nice not have to content with steering tourque anymore.  I'm also very impressed  with the 60"", 80 pound thrust Minnkota Fortrex bowmount. Even in strong winds it pulls the heavy boat with absolutely no problems.  The huge amount of storage is excellent and the rod locker under the front deck easily holds all of my musky rods too which is a nice way of keeping everything outta the way but also very accesible when needed. It's also nice to finally have a boat where I can carry the big Frabil without it constantly being in the way.  The disc brakes on the trailer making stopping on the road a breeze too.    I'm sure glad I changed my preferrences and decided to go with the full windshield and standup, convertible top. I've spent farrrrrrr too many years freezing my butt and being soaked to the bone in my tillers & side consol boats.    Now that my wife has retired, were gonna sell our home here in Toronto in the spring and buy a home in the country like we've always wanted. We've had trailers up near Lakefield since the early 70's and that's where were gonna move to.  Anyways, that's enuff of my rambling, but I just wanted to stop by and say howdy and let my fishing buds know I'm back in town.  I hafta admit though, it sure ISN'T good to be home in the city after laying around the lake all summer"
392596,Cast-Away,2009-10-13 19:08:00,790,Welcome back Lew! I was think about your absence recently.

392613,The Urban Fisherman,2009-10-13 19:35:00,2050,"Nice job on the deck Lew - and congrats again on the Skeeter.... makes me want to think twice about getting a bass boat someday... nice lookin' rig, and it could probably handle the big water out here on Erie much better...  Thanks for popin' by!  Cheers, Ryan"
392621,Radnine,2009-10-13 19:48:00,1538,Welcome back Lew! I am glad that the boat has worked out well for you. It sounds like a great summer of friends and family. It seems like all there is left to do is to head somewhere warm for the winter (once you call Muskie closed for the year). Jim
