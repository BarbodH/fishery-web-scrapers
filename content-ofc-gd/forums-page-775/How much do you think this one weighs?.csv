I'm afraid to click on ""view new posts""...just not enough time to catch up on the board...can't tear myself away from my new sweetheart  I'm out -- Momma has found a new love!   Gee...I hope I don't get flak for improper hold technique   Already dreaming about that first fishing trip....""it was THIS BIG""   And, in case you were wondering...we cracked the scales at 6lbs, 5oz...not bad for a 20 incher!!!
