392213,JoshS,2009-10-12 17:46:00,729,Damn and i thought I was seeing things! Thanks for posting and clearing things up.  I happened to catch a brief glimpse of it as I was moving and carrying a huge box.  Wasn't sure if what I saw was real or i was tripping out from over exertion lol.  I remember seeing a fireball shoot across the sky for about two seconds and burn out.  Really cool to see!!
