Talked to a few folks and nobody has seen much. Any luck elsewhere??? Good weather, no wind and no FREAKIN' moose."
394164,Skud,2009-10-18 22:20:00,739,Seen a few on trailers going south on the 400 Hwy. Looked like calves and small cows.  There are a few hides at Wolf's den that have been donated already.
394254,rickster,2009-10-19 02:27:00,495,Hey Brkygetr  talked to a CO and he said only three kills out of East Penassi opening weekend that he saw. Talked to a few camp owners also and they are saying the moose are still hanging tight to the water and not coming to the cuts yet.  Only got a calf tag but i am heading out this weekend for a walk and hope to get lucky  rick
