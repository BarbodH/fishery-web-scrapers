Yesterday -27 This AM -12  Where we got Whities yesterday only could entice 1 today,  So we were on the move and Budda Boom Budda Bing  Fish On. Ok we have our Whities. and it is FAR TOO nice a Day to go Home yet!! Lets go 'Looking for Lakers!!!  Meegs was again the lure that put the most fish on the Ice But the Williams did produce also.   We go Wandering Aimlessly, Drilling and Jigging and We Do find one Laker and 3 more Whities.  TRavelling was good, and for the most part the Sleds are still staying on top, did get into one small slush bed, The slush has been tightening up over the last Cold Nights However with the Warm temps and winds comming they will likely not freeze overnight and will get bigger,  So play Safe and Have Fun  One of Each From To-Day     Rick"
