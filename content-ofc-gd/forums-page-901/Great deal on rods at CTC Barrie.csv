302110,Cudz,2009-02-06 02:12:00,2652,"I bought 2 rods from CTC Barrie South store. They are both the same. Quantum Response IM6. 7' Medium action 9 fuji guide split cork handle  regular price $69.99  on sale for $19.99 These are decent quality.  Not Loomis or St.Croix et al. but not bad.  I do lots of smallie fishing so these will be great for drop shotting, tubing, and even throwing a senko. There are still about 7 or 8 left at the Mapleview store. "
302131,Skud,2009-02-06 02:54:00,739,Thanks for the heads up. I live just down the road and I have a few extra reels that need a rod to go with.

303154,StylinCatch,2009-02-08 03:40:00,43,"Good deal forsure, wish the CTC in North Bay co-operated haha,"
303164,waterwolf,2009-02-08 03:49:00,556,"great to hear you got a good deal on some rods but i have a beef with CTC.  power augers, decent ice fishing equipment ,, something smaller than xxxl hunting clothing and good deals on soft water fishing equipment .  these items seldem get stocked at all in the brampton?mississauga stores. i can understand [a bit] why out-lying stores get the nod for this gear but that doesn't help me at all.  they had a flyer out for a power auger cheap  and 50% off ice fishing equip. . went to check it out,,""we didn't get any of those at this store"" i asked where are you hiding all of the ice fishin' gear ? ""that's it over there"". you're  kidding ,,3 guppy rods and a couple packs of twister tails  , grrrrrr. my buddy got a pair of huntin' pants cheap ,, he's xxxl. they had nothing smaller."
