Went into Cleveland yesterday to a machine tool supply shop, needed carbide bits to cut through an easy out I broke off in a bolt.  Picked up a couple 1/8 and 3/16 carbide bits to use on a 1/4 inch bolt, also a couple of odd shaped carbide cutters, 1 with like a ball end 5/32 and one drill shaped but with smaller spiral cutters instead of the customary flute shaped grooves on the of a drill bit.  Took some time but cut right thru the broken easy out, went through it a couple more times with progressively larger drill bits and then re-tapped the hole. Done!  Stainless 1/20 bolts now in place with some anti-seeze paste on them just in case. LOL now it warms up! Not for long though I guess?"
