303056,Whopper,2009-02-08 01:07:00,2174,  My thoughts exactly Wayne  Sorry to hear one lost his life over this.  Could have been a lot worse  Don't think any of these guys woke up with a death wish this morning
303073,Joeytier,2009-02-08 01:43:00,3990,"Perhaps the sheriff should take the time to consider the amount of people that go out and fish Lake Erie and lakes like it on a DAILY basis without ever encountering anything like this, as well the number of days with identical conditions with no adverse consequences.  He's got his head up his ass on this on this one.  It was a freak accident, and this is why the rescue operations exist.  God forbid we might have to spend a little of the taxpayers money to save hundreds of lives."
