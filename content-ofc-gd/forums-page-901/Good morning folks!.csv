302273,Roy,2009-02-06 11:42:00,13728,"Morning Brian. Have a great day! I was flippin' through some older tunes this morning and found this one. The boys are my age now! Of course, they were back then as well.  It's nice to see those guys get together again after that many years.  A question to you guts though...I was wondering if Opry North (I think it was sponsored by CFGM in the mid 70's) still exists.  Was written as a work song but the Fendermen did it as a feel good tune. Worth a listen just to see the joy in their faces now.  <object width=""425"" height=""344""><param name=""movie"" value=""  Turn your sound up and have a great day!"
