302197,chickenhawk,2009-02-06 04:22:00,612,go out with pink worms and flies and things that look like roe until you catch a hen....then skein her out....or maybe talk to a fish hatchery in the area or even a local tackle store will prolly have a bit of rainbow or chinook roe kickin around....good luck
