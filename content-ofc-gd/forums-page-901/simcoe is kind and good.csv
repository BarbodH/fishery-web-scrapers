302235,waterwolf,2009-02-06 05:28:00,556,"i was on time ,,they were late . met 2 buds close to shanty bay an hour after the time agreed upon.  i don't have an arguement ,, they hold the key to the hut and the tank of propane ,,, a bit nipply for a contest on that one.     i waited in the truck quietly. it's never what it seems when a buddy says they're doin' great ,,fish are a nuisance ,, an interruption ,, we're talkin' here, buzz off finned irritants!!!     okay ,, i'm in!!    right?  they were late ,, i was less than happy ,,,,, i grabbed a halo pretty quick and forgave these morons when the tip-ups started to dance!!  we caught a few but man,, it was nonstop. missed a bunch ,, kept us starin' at those tip-ups with itchy fingers.  laughed all day to the tall tales ,"" they,"" iced some beauties ,"" i "" netted,and had a really great time .  simcoe really surprised me .  honestly ,,all day!   incredible action,,, she's amazing!!  pike'n on my pond might take a back seat to simcoe troutin',, for a bit.  i had a great time on a healthy body of water.  I must apologize for poor photo quality,,, disposable cameras are more beer friendly.  Talented hands prevail.   Great net job on a solid laker.     A few more for the good guys,       looking forward to another trip on this great fishery!!"

302282,12footspringbok,2009-02-06 12:08:00,459,"Yes, waiting for people sucks. I usually pick up my friends when were going out, and i tell them all the same thing. I'll be in your driveway at such a time if you aren't out in five minutes or i see no lights on i'm going with out ya.... Good job on the lake trout!"

302475,waterwolf,2009-02-06 21:51:00,556,"was'nt too upset,, should have expected it ,, i've known one of 'em for 35yrs. ,, he's always ""runnin'a bit behind"" there wasn't even a breeze out there, beauty day,, only 6 other people fishing in the area , man it was nice and quiet,, perfect. might make the drive again tomorrow , just have to find if the hut has any reservations available. we got over-run with phone calls from others who share time in the hut ,, asking if the hut was producing, we'll see if they can squeeze me in . maybe just cut a hole next to the hut lol. either way i'll be out on the ice somewhere tomorrow for sure .  thanks jacques stay safe"
302477,snag,2009-02-06 21:56:00,1932,"Wow, solid fish man!  Nice shack too!   What were they after this time??  "
302660,Leecher,2009-02-07 03:08:00,7832," OK, but still, he could of gave you a call to let you know that he was running late and that is if you had a cell phone with you at the time.   Going out tomorrow.... leaving home @5:30am and hitting 2 lakes, one for eyes and the other whities  Just got back from buying a couple dozen of minnows and got my lunch and all my gear ready..... man just can't wait  Will keep an eye out for report Tight lines and good luck tomorrow!!
