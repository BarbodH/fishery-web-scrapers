303098,SBCregal,2009-02-08 02:23:00,688,"something ive noticed in all the reports with whitefish in them is how they're all bleeding.  ive never caught a whitie before, or fished for them for that matter.  i was wondering what causes them to bleed like that? is it just something that gets done to fish you're keeping or does it happen to all the fish brought through the ice? is it from being brought in from the depths?

303108,irishfield,2009-02-08 02:34:00,26272,I suspect it's flicking their gills out to kill them quick.
303111,SBCregal,2009-02-08 02:36:00,688,"gotcha, i was wondering if it happened with all of the whities caught.  guess its just the ones that are destined for the dinnerplate"
303113,irishfield,2009-02-08 02:37:00,26272,I'm speculating.. but all that our group of guys pulled up from 60+ feet last year and mine last week at 72 feet weren't bleeding and released just fine.
303116,richyb,2009-02-08 02:40:00,774,"Likely from getting ""bonked"" on the head to kill them. Ive got lots of whities this winter and the only ones that bleed are the ones that i kill and keep."
303118,SBCregal,2009-02-08 02:42:00,688,i see.  i didnt doubt that most live to see another day but the only whitefish i've seen other than on here was from viking bakery and came from his smoker  mmmmmmmm
303120,purekgw,2009-02-08 02:43:00,585,the reason the one in my pic is bleeding is because we had such a hard time  getting it through hole we had to gill it and since we keeping it didnt matter where we grabbed it and didnt want it to suffer
