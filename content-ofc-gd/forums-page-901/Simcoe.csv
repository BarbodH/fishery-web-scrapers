Didn't mark to much on the the fish finder all morning but what we did mark were on the bite. By 830 we had both lost two and the action slowed down. Then around ten just when i was saying we should leave marked something got him to bit and landed a nice little white fish, not too minutes later my friend hooked and landed a small laker that we released.
