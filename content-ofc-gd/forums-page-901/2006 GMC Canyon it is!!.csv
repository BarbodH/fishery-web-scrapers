302575,Mattones,2009-02-07 00:46:00,587,I spoke with my parents tonight and they are telling me to buy new.  I would feel like crap knowing when i drive off the lot it will drop 40%. But i guess it wont hurt to check them out.
302635,JohnAB,2009-02-07 02:25:00,178,"For what it is worth, I bought a used 2006 GMC Canyon last summer out here. 42,700 km with the 2.8 l 4 cylinder. Paid $12500 and it came with a warranty to 147000 kilometers. The little 2.8 has surprised me with its power and fuel economy. I pull a 16 foot Crestliner Fishhawk side console just fine. Still when pulling at 110 klicks i get a good 23 to 25 mpgs. Empty it will scare 30 mpg. Hauled moose and most everything else in it with no complaints."
302641,Mattones,2009-02-07 02:34:00,587, Is it a daily use truck? I guess so since you put on all those clicks.   is yours 4x4?  I have drove a 2.8 | 4 cyl car a few times. I found the acceleration to slow compared to a V6 which i'm use to driving. But with two speeding tickets I don't really need a 'faster' truck for my heavy foot. I figure I'll give it a shot if i find one in a canyon.
302874,pkedoom,2009-02-07 19:22:00,1,"hey mattons i got a 2005 colorado and love it, contact,Alice at applewood chevrolet and she will find one for u,she found mine and its awesome."
302921,Mattones,2009-02-07 21:07:00,587,"I think i have found one with 58,351 km $12,983.00! I test drove it today and it was nice. only thing wrong with it was by the rear passenger window there was about half inch by half inch area of rust. The girlfriends says its only rust but to me its like a disease that keeps getting wrose unless you redo the entire door.  I liked it very much. I said im checking out a few others today or may buy new. Showed me the car fax and its as clean as a whistle."
302272,BUSTER,2009-02-06 11:42:00,1336,"Did you look at repo depot?  or adesa public car auction in AYR(just west of cambridge)..lots of stuff being repo'd at this time of year and that means great deals for people who are buying...look around more,  cheers"
302300,limeyangler,2009-02-06 12:50:00,5204,i was gonna suggest a new ranger too...good advice Disspatcher.
302305,pikehunter,2009-02-06 13:06:00,1659,"The Rangers are a good deal right now, but just check out all the financing details with a fine tooth comb to see if the low interest rates are really good and check with your bank before signing on the line. You are better off with a brand new truck than a used one especially with the deals now. If you are going to spend up to 20 G's then why buy used? Get a new one, it might have a couple less bells and whistles but there is nothing, NOTHING like a brand new car!  Remember the Ranger is a Mazda with a different tag on the grill.  Keep us up to date on what you buy and happy motoring."
302351,Motorhead,2009-02-06 15:14:00,163,"  In early Dec I needed to get a new vehicle fast because I use it for work and my Astro Van crapped out on me... I went to the Ford dealership and told him what I wanted---- A no bells or whistles plain-jane 09 ranger ext cab with a V-6 for under $400 a month he came back with $395, told him OK we`ll be back after looking around... Next we went down the street to the mazda dealership told him what ford was offering and if he couldn`t beat it we were out of there... He came back with a loaded 08 mazda ext cab for $391 /month... needless to say I bought it and absolutely LOVE it...  decent on gas compared to my van (roughly 450km per $60 fill up at 80 cents) I`d look into getting new... you get the new smell and don`t have to worry about getting something that someone bought and drove the hell out of... Good luck with whatever you decide  Doug"

302474,Mattones,2009-02-06 21:49:00,587,"I'm not much a fan of the Rangers, Their dirt cheap yeah but I don't think ill buy one. If i buy a new 09 truck my insurance would sky rocket. lol I found an 06 Canyon with  58,351km for $13,785. But its a 2.8 4 cyl which blows.  I have looked all over Auto-Trader and on car dealerships in their used section for the past month. The one i first posted was one of the cheapest with the low KM's."
302567,John Bacon,2009-02-07 00:30:00,3277,Actually I don't think there would be any difference in the price of insurance between an '09 and an '06.  The only way you will save on insurance is if you decide not to get collision.  If you are borrowing that is not usually and option.  The '09 may even be cheaper to insure.  You should contact your insurance company before buying.
