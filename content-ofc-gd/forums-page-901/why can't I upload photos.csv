302457,Governator,2009-02-06 21:23:00,879,Are you trying to upload it as an attachment?  Or is it for the gallery?  Attachments have a max file size of 250K

302462,Governator,2009-02-06 21:27:00,879,yea I suggest opening an account at photobucket.  You can upload any photo you want there and there are links to embed them in to forums.
