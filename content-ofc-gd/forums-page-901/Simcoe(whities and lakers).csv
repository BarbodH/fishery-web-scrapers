302378,buckster,2009-02-06 17:23:00,530,"Seeing as last week had slowed down a little bit. This week i went out in search of some active fish on some of my old waypoint.     I had a whitie and laker newbie with me so i really wanted to get him into some fish,  he started to think i was all talk.  Well,  we set up in 58 fow and not another soul in site.  Just the way i like it.   Seeing as i lost my cam i couldnt take any action shots on the ice.  Nor could i take a group shot of all of our fish.   But we hit fish all day long.  The lure of the day was the williams whitefish,  half and half.   Its nice to see a newbie to the icefishing game  get hooked by feeling that whitie and laker tug.   We both went home with our limit of both whities and lakers.  Gotta love when the vex is lighting up red all day long!   Here is a pic of my fish    Enjoy, Buckster"
