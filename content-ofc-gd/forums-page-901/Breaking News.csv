302859,The Urban Fisherman,2009-02-07 18:44:00,2050,"Dumbasses!  I hope everybody gets back to shore safely, but come on, you shouldn't be dumb enough to make a make-shift bridge onto a floating piece of ice on a great lake."

302873,Ramble,2009-02-07 19:19:00,713,"Everytime i cross a big pressure crack i wonder if something like that is going to happen. As long as you don't end up in the water, i wouldn't mind it. Only time you'll ever be able to troll ice fishing.  -R-"
302878,Whopper,2009-02-07 19:26:00,2174,"  I doubt very seriously if all that are out there used the make shift bridge, many probably went out before first light and didn't even cross a pressure crack. Coast Guard is stating the ice mass is eight miles long, 30 have been rescued with another 150 still out there."
302879,centerpin_drift,2009-02-07 19:27:00,94,"man i really hope everyone gets back on shore safely, if anybody gets any updates on whether these guys get back on shore, please post and keep us updated.  you all know it could very well have been you."
302881,OhioFisherman,2009-02-07 19:29:00,6623,"Don`t know how they got out there but the coast guard usually only rescues people, not the sleds or 4 wheelers, your own deal on that. Could be n expensive trip? But as long as they are safe."
302888,Greencoachdog,2009-02-07 19:46:00,8163, That's what I was thinking... troll thru the hole!!!

302892,Joey,2009-02-07 19:56:00,9122,That's always been one of my fears Phil.  Thanks for the info.  I'll keep watching the news to see what happens.  Maybe a big barge can push the ice back.  Joey
302910,HTHM,2009-02-07 20:19:00,4082,"Holy Toledo, that is a risky situation to be in. 150 - 300 dumbasses? Not too likely that so many people made the same mistake. I hope things turn out well for everyone."
302920,The Urban Fisherman,2009-02-07 21:04:00,2050," The clip said they got onto the ice by crossing a make-shift bridge, and when it drifted out they couldn't get off, so I'm just going on that. Personally, my life is worth more than a few fish, not just because I value it, but because I have a kid (soon to be kids) and a wife that relies on me to be around.  I'm just a ""better safe than sorry"" kind of guy I guess.  A small pressure crack on an in-land lake that's frozen shore to shore is one thing, but crossing open water to get onto ""safe"" ice on a great lake, is in my opinion, dumb."
302924,oxcowboy,2009-02-07 21:21:00,544,"yahoo news is reporting that 1 has died, the person fell through trying to find a way off.  sad that a fun day on  the ice has turned to tragedy.  jason"
302925,irishfield,2009-02-07 21:23:00,26272,Better stay off Simcoe too then Ryan... because it's happened there in a south wind before !
302929,The Urban Fisherman,2009-02-07 21:28:00,2050," thanks for the heads up  All I'm saying is I wouldn't cross open water to go ice fishing on any body of water, especially a great lake."
302977,waterwolf,2009-02-07 22:40:00,556," someone lost their life ,, a bit of compassion is in order sir ."
302992,smokin joe,2009-02-07 23:08:00,226,I just hope the rest are rescued without anymore tragedy or injuries.
302999,lunkerbasshunter,2009-02-07 23:17:00,2585,"well i highly doubt it was a dumbass move, most likely they crossed the bridge thinking it was a pressure crack which happens on all lakes.  lets hope they all get out safe and sound  cheers!"
303016,The Urban Fisherman,2009-02-07 23:47:00,2050, I wrote that post long before it was announced. My condolences do go out to the family and friends of the victim.
303021,jediangler,2009-02-08 00:00:00,1923,I just hope none of the rescue people are lost trying to save these numbskulls. They should all foot the bill for these rescue operations.
