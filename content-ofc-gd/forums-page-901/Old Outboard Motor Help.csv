I have a 12 ft. aluminum and have never used an outboard on it because the lake I fish is electric only.  My wife's uncle has given me a 1956 (I think that is the year) Viking 6hp.  It is in very good shape and is very clean, but it has sat stored and unused for almost 20 years.  Before he gave it to me, he pulled it out and it started right up with a shot of fluid in the carburator though so that was exciting.  Sooo...long story short, my question is, other than changing the lower unit oil and spark plug, is there anything I should do to make it run better/safer before I use it on open water for the first time.  I must admit that I'm a little nervous of it because it is so old.  Any advice is greatly appreciated.  Thanks."
301817,Jonny,2009-02-05 16:29:00,1380,"Your Viking is probably a Chrysler underneath the hood. My Dad had some good luck with Vikings.  Lower unit oil is a must, and plugs. Other than that, check the rubber components (like spark plug wires) for cracks. Use some black electrical tape, or heat-shrink tubing, where you see signs of wear.  Grease or oil any joints and moving parts that are visible. Some can be sprayed with LPS 1 (my wonder cure and problem preventer for a lot of stuff - much better than WD-40).  After you have had the motor in operation for a few hours, drain and refill the lower unit oil again. If there's any water in the oil, you might have to change the seals, or at least drain and refill a few times per season. Depends on how much you use the motor, I guess.  6 HP is a nice little kicker for a 12-footer. And old motors are much more fun than new ones! Good luck with it."
301819,BITEME,2009-02-05 16:30:00,1969,stay close to shore i would check the impeller and the carb diaphram
301825,Uncle Buck,2009-02-05 16:47:00,1000,starting with a shot in the carb isn't ideal for the motor...
301932,DRIFTER_016,2009-02-05 21:05:00,10439,"Change the water pump impeller before you take it out on the water. It will have taken a set will be badlt deteriorated and will disintegrate as soon as it is used. You don't want the little bits of rubber to clog any of the water passages.  Change the plugs and do a carb rebuild, also replace any fuel lines and filter."
302134,sneak_e_pete,2009-02-06 02:59:00,540,Thanks for the advice. Any idea where I would get those parts?
302261,Jonny,2009-02-06 06:25:00,1380," Try some internet searches.  Here's one that came up when I typed in ""viking outboard parts canada"". Looks like you can get some help with Viking/Chrysler if you follow up the email addy...  http://www.mapleleafchapter.org/parts.html  BTW, it seems your motor could be newer than you think? ......... Looks like a 6 HP model wasn't made til 1968... according to this source anyway...  http://www.discount-marine-parts.com/ob_viking_model.html"
