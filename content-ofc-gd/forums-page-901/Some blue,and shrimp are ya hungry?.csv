Headed to gym,pumped off some steam (getting pretty stresed out these days)and came home refreshed and thought I would try something.Something different.Well not so different,but put a bit of a dinner together that I hope the mrs,s would like, since now she has become the seafood lover.  .After all we are doing the do,these days. Here ya go ,and you can do what ya want to it.  As always, I start off with the peppers,green and red. Instead of the white onions,I have gone with the challotes. Very nice. Oh and don forget the fresh garlic and please add some chillie peppers.The mrs thought this made the dish. It put just that bit of a bite in the dish. I added in some fresh cubed vine grown tomatoes(is there any other) to the mix. Allowed them to get happy for a half hour then added in some chicken stock.That you allow to simmer for an hour or so.After that you add in a can of cream celery.Allow to simmer for 30 minutes. You want all the flavors to get mixed.   Now once that is done,you get your baking dish. I dont have access to fresh blue fish so I get mine from the frozen dept.   Good thing ol highliner is hard at work. Place that big ol hunk in the dish,add about five pounds of yer tiger shrimp.       Now pour over the sauce,let bake for 40 minutes.         Once thats done,remove and do as I do,well ya dont have to, but you get the idea.Im sprinkling some fresh parma on the mix,to add some thickness.The rice is a whole grain. You be amazed at the flavor of this rice. I,ll be trying this again,but with wild rice and some mussels.    <embed width=""448"" height=""361"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" wmode=""transparent"" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/player.swf?file=http://vidmg.photobucket.com/albums/v731/misfish/pic02378.flv"">     <embed width=""448"" height=""361"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" wmode=""transparent"" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/player.swf?file=http://vidmg.photobucket.com/albums/v731/misfish/pic02379.flv"">   The end result.
