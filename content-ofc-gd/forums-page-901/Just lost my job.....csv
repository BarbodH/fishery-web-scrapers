302226,GBW,2009-02-06 05:17:00,8460,Stoty and I (and others) are both out of work in the past day or week and this conversation had gone way wrong... Would you look at the fish he's holding in his avatar and yet mine is a look over the lake from the sun deck.  GEEZZZZ people....
302227,GBW,2009-02-06 05:18:00,8460,"PS, if you know some one looking...."
302228,GBW,2009-02-06 05:18:00,8460,"bad taste, just kidding..."
302232,cram,2009-02-06 05:28:00,1733,Stoty -- where in the world did you get that largemouth??  How much did it weigh?
302317,Stoty,2009-02-06 13:24:00,2910,"Florida, 9lb 6oz  I'm hoping to break that record in a few weeks, when I am in FLA.  (I'm glad I had already paid for the trip! haha)"
302322,Headhunter,2009-02-06 13:46:00,5703,"Everything that life hands can be seen as an obstacle or an opportunity. It's been my experience in the employment industry (pushing 20 years now   ) that those who grab that latter and run with it, will succeed... those who don't, well they have to be lucky... I have connected with Stoty in the past and will say that he will land on his feet... I've got my ears open for yah bud! HH"
302329,Stoty,2009-02-06 14:07:00,2910,"Thanks HH, appreciate that."
302344,Pachone,2009-02-06 15:00:00,276,"Have you ever thought of starting a business? so you cannot be laid-off again? have people work for you, instead of for them? Job security does not exist these days unless u go out and get it for yourself.  If anyone on this board makes money in any shape or form. you should read ""rich dad, poor dad"" by Robert Kiyosaki. Its principles on how money works, and why we all work for it, and the different ways you can make... you choose.   http://cashflow-for-life.com/wp-content/up...ow_quadrant.jpg http://www.richdad.com/ http://books.google.com/books?id=5iIqi_OIK...=result#PPP1,M1  read this book instead of watching and staring at the gloom and doom all over the radio and news. Cheers!"
302356,Stoty,2009-02-06 15:23:00,2910,"I actually have my own business on the side, which I could try and turn around I guess....anyone need a website done?"
302359,Abberz,2009-02-06 15:32:00,140,"Stoty you have a PM regarding a lead in your area.  Cheers Pal,  Chris"
302373,TJQ,2009-02-06 16:49:00,7806,I had a chat with Stoty yesterday and gave him some ideas... and hopefully a bit of work as well.
302481,kickingfrog,2009-02-06 22:16:00,8333, Thanks for the reminder. My dad was right.  Have a nice day.
302204,holdfast,2009-02-06 04:33:00,1813," Hey, Thanks, for the Sensitivity or Political correctness training. Also the luck.  Ive had some in my day that's for sure.  But I think a lot of it had to do with motivation. Oh ya, also big shoulders.  You can assume all you want.  By the way, when me and my family, decided to do a big lifestyle change, IE get out of as job that was financially putting me Backwards, (Army) every time I was told to move my next house got more expensive, my last house I took a loss.  I decided to do something that I never did in 25 years.  Do a complete, life change.  Different job that I found, different Province, and no family or friends.  They're all in Ontario and Quebec. I was an a Member of OFC then too.  Do you recall me ever mentioning that. That being said, I really don't care what you think.  If I seen you face to face, I would say mind your own Buisness.  If Stoty feels offended, maybe he can tell me.  Not some little //, oh never mind!!!!!  Oh Abberez, you can PM me any time you want.  I wont answer till either tomorrow morning or Sunday.  You can tell me why I should feel sorry."
302210,kentooley,2009-02-06 04:42:00,208,Hey Holdfast!  This thread isn't about you!!!   :lol:
302212,Stoty,2009-02-06 04:45:00,2910, Hey now...keep me outta this!
302217,Abberz,2009-02-06 04:54:00,140,"  No one is asking you to feel sorry for Stoty, and no one is telling you your life hasn't been tough, but there is no reason to TELL a man WHAT to do otherwise you won't feel sorry for him on one of the lowest day's of his life."
302220,Stoty,2009-02-06 05:03:00,2910,"K...this is getting a little off topic.  This post wasn't to make anyone feel bad for me, or whatever. It was to use the core element of the site (networking), to possibly aid in finding a new job.  Believe it or not...losing my job is the 3rd most important thing on my plate right now. If I wanted people to feel bad for me, I would have told everything that's happening in my life right now.  If you want to bicker back and forth, please keep it to the PM's."
301758,Stoty,2009-02-05 14:31:00,2910,"Well, I (along with 21 other people) just lost their jobs this morning. Our company filed for bankruptcy, and was sold, and the new owners were told to cut costs.  So, if anyone knows of anything computer (web) based, please PM me.  I have a very strong resume, so if you know of anyone would might be interested in my services, please let me know.  Any help is much appreciated.  *Stoty"
301759,medmart,2009-02-05 14:36:00,587,That sucks Stoty hope you find something soon  Rob

301851,tinbanger,2009-02-05 18:23:00,1028,"Bad news for sure  I may be in the same boat come Mid Feb , we are just waiting to hear how many and who  Best of luck  TB"
301854,e-z-out,2009-02-05 18:28:00,1052,"I had the same bad news sunday but lucky for me i found a job within 2 days. Its getting harder now adays with more and more people losing there jobs. This morning i heard Bombardier will be cutting over 1,500 jobs as of tomorrow.  Time to tighten up the wallet and lay back on the big buys.  All the best Stoty on the job hunt."
301855,irishfield,2009-02-05 18:28:00,26272,Well that Sucks Jamie... guess that new fish finder you had your eye on for the boat just got delayed. You'll bounce back before you need gas for the boat!

301870,kemper,2009-02-05 19:11:00,2232," Funny how that works eh, because its actually spending that would help us out of this mess. Of course, how do you spend when you lose a job   Im sure you will bounce back Stoty, especially with a good resume. There are lots of companies ditching employees but there are also some looking for more specialized employees that can do a better, more efficient job."
301873,snag,2009-02-05 19:15:00,1932,Good luck man.  A lot of nervous people around here.  Had some lay-offs this month and major budget cuts.  
301878,misfish,2009-02-05 19:19:00,29133, Have no idea what yer talking about there Jamie.  Sorry about the job thing though.
301908,Stoty,2009-02-05 20:11:00,2910,"The Ranger came with a Sonar/GPS unit, so I dont need a new fishfinder now. I just need a map chip to put in it!"

Just don't get too down.... looking for work can be tough on one's esteem.  You may have to take a bit of detour for now....why not look into TTC as Maureen stated.  Hope it all works out for you.
