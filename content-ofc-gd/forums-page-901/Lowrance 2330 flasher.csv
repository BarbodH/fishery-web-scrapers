I took it off right away, because at the time, I didn't know how to use it.  I just hooked it up to a battery, and it seems to be working.  Is this thing worth setting up for icefishing, or am I wasting my time? I've done a little research online, and came up with some positive info, just curious if anyone here actually has one, and has an opinion on it??  Sinker"

302494,Big Cliff,2009-02-06 22:36:00,6899,I don't have one of those units but I do have an FL8SE and to be honest I wouldn't go ice fishing without one again. In fact I'm thinking of putting it in my boat this summer for when I'm still fishing.
