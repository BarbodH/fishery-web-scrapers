301795,Bly,2009-02-05 15:32:00,1556,Nice brookies!   Glad to hear the trip was a success.  Loved the shot of the lake with no tracks.
301896,buckster,2009-02-05 19:59:00,530,Nice fish!  I knew i shoulda joined you and Rich.  I woulda probably needed  2-4'x8' sheets of plywood to use for snowshoes in that snow.   I kinda like going out with that thing with skis and a motor.......u know that watchamacallit thats on my trailer
302025,Sinker,2009-02-06 00:00:00,8692," Ha.......I'm not sure what it would take to get you off simcoe!!! I've made several good trips away from her now, and sent the invite.......maybe next time you'll break the habit, and try a different lake???? You must be growing scales by now......are your lips turning downward too???  BTW......just ate those trout........OMG......I'm going bask asap!!!!  Sinker"
302049,buckster,2009-02-06 00:47:00,530,  You know as well as i do there are no fish in SIMCOE
302124,Sinker,2009-02-06 02:47:00,8692,There's no specks that I know of anyways
302126,purekgw,2009-02-06 02:51:00,585,nice fish man
302194,Jigger,2009-02-06 04:18:00,1237,those shots of the untrekked snow really set the stage and puts you there. Great adventure man! And great looking fish too!
302201,limeyangler,2009-02-06 04:26:00,5204,    Crack of 1:30pm....lol....too funny.   looks like it was more than worth the effort and crotch freeze though...outstanding work Mr. Sinker   I've only tried once for those trout...was not successful....lol....but been up to the nutz in snow before very successfully
302488,Sinker,2009-02-06 22:31:00,8692,"  Limey, there has got to be some amazing speck fishing up your way!! They are the king of trout man, getter done!!! If I lived up there, that's all I'd be after. I""m sure there are some brutes around that area someplace!!  Sinker"
302533,Greencoachdog,2009-02-06 23:45:00,8163,"Is that those Mexican type Carp you were tellin' me about in chat the other night Bubba???  They look kinda like Brook Trout... don't they?  Great effort on both you and your Bud's part!!!  ... but I gotta say, they must not have been in there that thick if you didn't catch very many eh?  Lookin' forward to your next   report!!!"
302704,Sinker,2009-02-07 04:35:00,8692," Ha.......nope, couldn't find the mexican carp lake Glen........it seems to have dissappeared  Them right there are the king of the trouts! Some great eatin I tell ya!!! Worth every ounce of sweat!!!  Sinker"
302708,Greencoachdog,2009-02-07 04:42:00,8163," Really???  I thought trouts had lower frontal lobes and that really dull look in their eye ... yanno, like the ones you see in the steelhead reports here..."
302709,Sinker,2009-02-07 04:46:00,8692,"Those steelheads are easy pickins. You can catch them anywhere........  I know where your going.......and you are absolutly right. Specks are actually a char, but they're still the king of trouts!!!"
302719,BassAsin,2009-02-07 05:13:00,806,"great report sinker, havnt had the snowshoe adventures in about 3 years since my old man moved away, sure love seeing them photos, dont ya just hate when lakes dry up and disappear? hahah       good job on gettin a nice catch of beauty specks,    as for being packed full they may have been empty the day prior, darn hit and miss fish! never know when they are gonna turn on the feed, good work and dont blame it on being out of shape, but rather the snowshoes are too heavy or not big enough to keep ya up top or the snow was sticky. hahah      good luck on the next voyage and good luck if the next trip is for pike too!  Matt!"
302723,Sinker,2009-02-07 05:21:00,8692," Yep, hit and miss fish for sure. I've been skunked on this lake soooo many times its not even funny. If the other lake hadn't dried up and dissappeared, I wouldn't have gone!! LOL  I think I'm just a lil outta shape though. I needed the workout! Getta get off the smokes eh  Sinker"
302726,BassAsin,2009-02-07 05:35:00,806,"i'm trying to get off them, and i can relate to the deep snow and snowshoes i bought a set of tubbs 36 inchers 2 years ago and are by far the best i have ever used!     skunked? fishin specks? hahahhah happens all too often, although a day of gettin skunked speck fishin is better than a kick in the twins any day."
302729,Sinker,2009-02-07 05:40:00,8692,"I have a set of tubbs as well. This time I broke out the old 14x48 old school rackets. They saved our ass!! Anything smaller would have been brutal. We were still sinking over a foot with those big boys on!!!  Your right, skunked speck fishing is for sure better than a kick in the twins!!!!  Sinker"
302731,BassAsin,2009-02-07 05:44:00,806,that much snow eh? those are brutal walks for sure make a mile feel like 5!  do you do much lookin down the hole when fishin your squares?
302732,Sinker,2009-02-07 05:50:00,8692,"Its not that there was that much snow.......there was a few feet.......but it was all light powder. You'd need a sheet of plywood to stay on top.... LOL. A workout anyway you look at it.  I always look down the hole fishin specks. I've seen some amazing things doing it too. One time there was a cray fish at the bottom of the hole. So I tried to snag him up. I'd get him, and lift it a few inches off bottom, then he'd get off. I'd snag him again, same thing, a couple inches up he'd get off. All the while, I'm stirring up the bottom. Well don't ya know it, in comes  a big ole speck and grabs the crayfish!!! Didn't even look at my jig.........what a jerk!!! LOL They'll eat anything!!!!  Sinker"
302734,BassAsin,2009-02-07 06:09:00,806,hahahahahha had u snagged him just before the speck ate it up! i have cleaned a few in march through the ice that have had frog(s) in them like 4 5 6 7 of them they were 4 and 5 pounders but suckin them outa the mud!
301533,Sinker,2009-02-05 01:53:00,8692,"Well, my plan today was to hit a lake I've been to once before, a long, long time ago, for splake. We headed out, got in the area, but for the life of me, I couldn't find the lake   We got out at one point, strapped on the snow shoes and walked a good KM before I said screw this, we're not in the right spot, and left again.  Then we geared into plan B. By this time, its 11am. I knew a little brookie lake in the area so off we go.  We made the 2km hike in, in snow up to our crotch...  ...it was a workout to say the least......thank god for snowshoes, or we never would have made it. Got to the lake at the crack of 1:30pm. Not a track.......    We hiked across to my lucky little hole.........    And got set up. It didn't take long and Rich had a  fish on......sweet!! I was watching him fight this fish, when I heard something behind me......I turned around and my rod was headed for the hole.......I made the save and we started the day with a nice double!! Here's mine......about 12"" or so....    Rich ended up getting one more as soon as he got his line back down........man, this is looking good! 3 fish on the ice in less than 10 minutes!!!  After that little flurry of action, things went quiet. We decided we were well overdue for our lunch, so got set up on shore with a small fire, and a lunch. We were planning on frying up a few fish, but by this time, we were already waaaaay behind schedule, so we opted for a hot cup of tea, and cold sandwiches.......the fire was nice though.    Heres a shot of our little set up........there was about 2ft of snow on the lake, and 6"" of slush under that......what a mess.    We sat in the sun, by the fire, taking turns checking lines. Every once in a while, there would be a minnow missing, and it seemed like everytime you'd replace it, you'd get a fish or two. It also seemed like they came around when Rich was checking the lines....   I only got the one fish right at the start.......Rich got his limit.   We split them up at the end of the day, so it was no bother to me anyways.  Heres the final tally for the day.    I know whats for dinner tomorrow night!!!  All the fish were stuffed with inverts and tiny little dace minnows. I'm surprised we got any at all.....they were full to the brim......greedy little buggers!!!  It was a great day. I have been waiting for the right day to do this tour all season. Other than the crotch deep snow, I think the day was perfect. It was a little brisk first thing in the morning, but once that sun was up, it was mint!! Now I'm just beat.......it was quite the workout, and I realized just how out of shape I'm getting......LOL.  I think next week, I might target some pike.  Sinker"

301609,douG,2009-02-05 02:56:00,2693,I liked the shot of the pristine lake almost as much as the group shot of dinner.  That work paid off.
