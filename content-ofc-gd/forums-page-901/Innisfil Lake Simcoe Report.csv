301986,Clampet,2009-02-05 22:52:00,1947,"-28  degrees!  The car’s temp gauge  barely made it above the C mark, providing minimal heat on the trip  there.  Arrived at the spot by  9:30 AM.  A thin upper crust did  it’s best to stop me from breaking thru at regular intervals into the 4-6” of  slush atop 10” of ice.  One chilled Catherine,  was the deciding factor to leave at 12:30 PM.  3 small Perch caught at  3 different sites in the general area (I kept moving in the hope of finding more  cooperative fish)  I think the cold temps  shut them down, that’s my story, and I’m sticking to  it.  I should have left  later to arrive around 3:00 PM to fish till dusk, which may have proven more  effective.  Here’s a couple of  pictures:      "

302263,Woodsman,2009-02-06 06:31:00,1286,"I was also there today. Myself & a buddy decided to head out to Innisfil for some icefishing. Started out in 80' of water targeting whitefish. Here's a decent whitey George caught.  The largest fish of the day I was lucky enough to get.  After catching our limit on whitefish & we lost a few on the way up before limiting out, we moved in to shallower water & caught between 20-25 smaller perch. We were in 22' of water out from a yellow doored boat house a few hundred yards south of the boat ramp. Overall George may have beat me on numbers but size also counts. Arrived about 8 am and left a dark. Last vehicle out of the parking lot at the park.  Best: Wishes: Rick"

302333,troutologist,2009-02-06 14:15:00,951,I was hoping for the inclusion of the tarpus maximus in this report!  Some fish is always better than none....unless they're whistling trout.
