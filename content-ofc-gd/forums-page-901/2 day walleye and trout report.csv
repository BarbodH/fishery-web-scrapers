302233,limeyangler,2009-02-06 05:28:00,5204,  Ya...was a good team we had there last year...if we'd rgistered our extra points and got a muskie we were in with a shout at 2nd place!
302316,b2kptbo,2009-02-06 13:23:00,1505,"Looks like a good time, well done report, thanks..."
302326,Greencoachdog,2009-02-06 14:00:00,8163,"Excellent report and roight noice fish, pics, and vids!!!  WTG on the NGL Troot upgrade for your team  ... but don't y'all need a Walleye too???  ... on second thought though, it would probably be better not to overload Captain Slowpoke with more than one entry at a time eh?... or maybe you're waiting for Roy to pull something up thru the ice?"
302407,limeyangler,2009-02-06 18:27:00,5204,   lololol
302411,TroutnMuskieHunter,2009-02-06 18:37:00,1362,"   Thanks Simon, you never know...I just might take you up on that sometime this year  Bring Jacques with me and Whitespinnerbait  ......Jacques would need an Ontario Fishin' license which he's not to KEEN on buyin'   ...we discussed this last weekend while fishin' in Quebec   ...so if anything, I'd be comin' up with Whitespinnerbait......unless Jacques decides to change his mind after seeing this"
301879,snag,2009-02-05 19:24:00,1932,"Blimey Limey that was brilliant!!  That eagle is a beauty.  Got to love those sunny days when no hut is needed and you can even peel a layer.  Great report as always,  Cheers  "
301881,johnnyb,2009-02-05 19:31:00,3413,"Awesome stuff, man!!  Love the play-by-play on the video clip of the sonar    I use small-ish red hooks for stingers...never fish without'em.  Looks like you're out of the woods...keep it rolling"
301895,Leecher,2009-02-05 19:59:00,7832,Simon are you sure you weren't using the barbless hooks you bought at your local shop on day 1 Man you got a lot of hit n miss  But different story on day 2 Got to love it when the fish come out to play like that....

Just wish lew and dave could've got the good bite on Thunder.         certainly was big...about 2/3 the size of a golden retriever...or maybe that's what it was snacking on          Glad you enjoyed that twighlight....i could never fish without my Lowrance....dont know how i ever did before!        Yeah Sinker it was fun....can't wait till opening weekend....last year that was only 2 weeks after ice out, my buddy Dave was in there with his boat, the trout were still shallow and he was hitting 20""+ walleye and 25""+ trout along one stretch of shoreline in 25'FOW on little joe walleye spinners on light spinning rods....OH YEAH! COME ON 3RD WEEKEND IN MAY !         I'm gonna Keep on it as long as i can, but with the baby due anytime now...time is running out for me....so you'll have to take me to that Walleye/Laker venue you went to last week sometime soon Dale...sound good? Is that a genius plan or what?       Hey JB.....can ya do me a big favor?....next time your out take a pic of how you rig your stinger and where ya stick it in the bait....would be much appreciated...         Would seem i was using those darned hooks again Jaques          Cheers Roy....just cant believe it took me sooooooo long to register one for us......i promise to try harder....lol        your welcome up anytime, if ya come bring Jacques and Whitespinnerbait with ya!"

302203,Joey,2009-02-06 04:29:00,9122,"What an awesome report Simon.  Very good read.  That fish sure was a tease on that finder.  I don't like treble hooks that much either.  I find they are a pain to unhook.  Maybe just sharpen your hooks up.  I must say, I miss you being on my team this year  Nice fish bud.  Joey"
