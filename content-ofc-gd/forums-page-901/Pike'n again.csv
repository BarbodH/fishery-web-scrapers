302193,chickenhawk,2009-02-06 04:18:00,612,nice jacks and that is a HUGE water beetle....nice report....
302202,Ramble,2009-02-06 04:27:00,713,"..water BUG. It's not a Coleoptera (beetle), its Hemiptera...the ""true bugs"". LoL  Might be a ""Giant Water Bug"" or one of the ""Toe Biters""  Anyway. Nice little report. I love eating on the ice like that and the fish are always a bonus.  You should set up a photobucket account for you're photos. Easy and it presents them a little nicer.  Again, nice outing.  -Dave"
