One short drift at a time then the sluch and chunks would roll in and we had to wait for 5 min before we could do a drift again. Nomad had several roe takers today but didn't get the hook into em. The day was a beauty and our hopes were high but the river had other plans. I think I'll wait til spring before I climb the stairway to heaven again. Fishin it in these conditions is not impossible but just not fun, I dunno what we would have done had we hooked a good one. Standing on slab piled up ice on shore prolly 8-10' off the water would make landing a fish interesting.    "

302811,jwl,2009-02-07 16:10:00,1056,"shoot me a PM next time you guys plan on hitting the river, I always have up to the minute reports on conditions practically, might save you a trip and some trouble"

303060,joonmoon,2009-02-08 01:13:00,528,"We'll keep that in mind JWL, I think we just needed to go anyway, you know what its like when you haven't been out for over a week. Hafta...lol. Should of gone to Simcoe, oh well thanks for a good day anyway Nomad."
