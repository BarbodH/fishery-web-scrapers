301660,Sinker,2009-02-05 04:24:00,8692,"A quad would not have gone where I went today, that is FOR SURE!!  A sled MIGHT have made it, but I wouldn't have tried it. LOL  But seriously, a machine solely for icefishing is a sled. PERIOD.  If you only  fish thru the ice a few times a year, and pick your days......then a quad would be better for YOU.  Sinker"
301707,motion,2009-02-05 12:19:00,403,"All great points. Thanks for confusing me more.......LOL. Seriously though, I think Jr. and I may get more use from quad. We may have to be a little more patient and may have to pick our days and spots to pop the holes. Anyhow, if anybody knows of decent quad, let me know."
301799,Jonny,2009-02-05 15:39:00,1380,"Sled or quad?  From what I understand about that area, if I were fishing Simcoe (and I could get only ONE machine) I would get a quad. Most of the time you will be in little snow, and at times when you are not, you will have compacted snowmobile tracks you can follow to almost anywhere. No worries about burning out sliders in glare ice conditions, you can pack a lot of gear without needing a trailer, and in almost all conditions except deep snow, you will be able to go wherever a sled goes.  I would, however, get a machine that is 4x4 and large (2 up seat and lots of rack/bin space). I would not settle for 4x2. In that case I'd rather go with a sled.  No machine is perfect for everything and all conditions. But I can use my quad regularly here on Nipissing in all but the deepest snow cover, and I can use it for bush riding in the other seasons as well.  There have been slush conditions where my sled didn't have a hope in hell of pulling my ice hut off the lake in March, and yet the quad bulled it out without a pause. Not all quads are the same, just as not all sleds are the same. It's a bit of the luck of the draw, especially if you're buying used. You can only go by word of mouth and general principles (like you know a 4x4 will go where a 4x2 can't). You won't know how your machine works in certain conditions until you put it into those conditions!  And as you learn, you'll learn to pick your days and conditions so your machine works the best.  Oh yeah, a quad also works A LOT better if you have to travel some gravel road to get onto a lake. When everything's melting and wet, but the ice is still beautiful, I have sometimes cursed the gravel I had to drive my sled on to get to a lake."
301826,buckster,2009-02-05 16:47:00,530,"If u are after whities and lakers on simcoe.  A sled is the only way to go.   I'm usually out at least 3-4 miles.  Not to many sled trails for an atv to follow out there.   Year in year out there are a lot of slush beds to deal with.  Some years worse than others.   I have never got stuck with my sleds but have pulled out quite a few quads, even a few 800cc models.  If its only for icefishing which is done in the winter why would you even think of getting anything other than a seld.    Also a used atv can just be a whole heap of problems.....   Who knows how many times it was lost inside mud holes.    Get a sled...... have a look around the lake  id say 80% sleds  if not more!    Good luck with whatever you do get!"
301833,ch312,2009-02-05 17:05:00,1590,"for getting cheap ATV's buy in the states! im planning on purchasing an 09 grizzly 550 with power steering this year and the camo version lists for $6,600 at one dealer. the EXACT same ATV is listed for $11,300 at the local yamaha dealer. even with the exchange, duty, taxes, gas, etc it will still be around $3,000 cheaper buying from the US. only a few hundred bucks extra for delivery to the border as well...  canadians are getting raped as usual. even the can am ATV's that are made in CANADA are much cheaper in the US..."
301841,motion,2009-02-05 17:30:00,403,I think the other reasons I was thinking quad was the fact that I will be throwing it the back of my pick up and I think they are a little smaller in size and easier to jockey around my small garage.
301916,richyb,2009-02-05 20:35:00,774,Right now on simcoe ( the big lake where theres no trails) a 2wd quad wouldnt make it anywhere. My buddy took his 2wd quad out to his hut thats about 1 km out and he had to push it 90% of the time. I would buy a sled 100% for fishing. You get to your spots faster plus its nice and comfy to sit on while fishing. I doubt after this weekend even the biggest quads would make it anywhere because there is going to be alot of slush.
301919,ciceri,2009-02-05 20:38:00,535," yea right. sled would be easier, use a snowbank to put it in, then just slide it out and let it drop to take it off. For the garage you can get dollies with casters that go under the skis and track to wheel it around"
301945,ch312,2009-02-05 21:27:00,1590," because theres always going to be a snow drift for ya, right?  atv's are a little shorter and are very easy to spin around because you can often grab the bumpers and be at a good height for lifting. sleds are usually lower and tend to be harder on the back when moving them around without wheels. atv's are also easier to get outta deep snow when you get stuck.  you could debate this until the cows come home but in the end neither is perfect."
301952,ciceri,2009-02-05 21:44:00,535," well i said snowbank, either way.  and whats deep snow for a ATV, 1-2 feet? where as a sled would get stuck in like 4 feet, and theres a very easy way of getting a sled unstuck which wouldnt work with a quad.  it could go forever"
301955,TroutnMuskieHunter,2009-02-05 21:48:00,1362,"Great topic  ...I have a 4x4 Kawasaki 650 BruteForce ATV and it gets me to most of my backwoods lakes almost all year long, except for when we get a winter with lots of snow!!  ......the quad is powerful, but the ITP Mudlite tires just dig down in deep snow to a point where the bike gets hung up on the undercarriage and then that's it...you're done!!  I also have an older sled that my wife uses now but even then, I've had nightmare trips burying it in deep snow while trying to break trail gettin' into some of the trout lakes. and then having to pull it out ..  This is my next purchase for the ATV and then there's no stopping me as far as where I can get to year round!!!...      The track kit is a little steep ($3800), but I figure it would cost me around the same $$$$ to buy a used sled.....on top of that I'd have to pay insurance for the sled and then spend the $$$ on yearly maintenance...."
302314,motion,2009-02-06 13:17:00,403,I guess if money is no object then that would be the perfect solution. Kinda the best of both worlds. Money is tight so that is out for me. I am going to look at that Yamaha moto four tomorrow. I am worried though that it is only a two wheel drive and only a 250 cc engine. I have been told by some it will be fine and by others it wont. i guess the only way to find out is to try it in the snow and see what she does.
302341,Jonny,2009-02-06 14:40:00,1380,"My first ATV was an '84 Yamaha Tri-Moto 250cc. That thing could go through some TURRIBLE mud and even though I'm a big guy it seemed to have plenty of power for getting around. You're talking a 4-wheeler which will be better for keeping your front end up, though it will also be somewhat heavier.  I'm thinking that all-round, you could be happy enough with it, if you tell yourself from the outset that you will NOT be going out on the ice in all conditions. Some winters you'll be out there often, others you'll be biding your time on shore til you get the conditions you prefer.  We all make compromises because of money (doesn't grow on trees) and/or  preferences (i.e. small boat that's handy for getting into tough spots but when you decide you want to get on big water... oops! no damn good for that!)  Anyway, if you pick this machine up and use it this month, it would be fun to hear how it works for you. Good luck."

301407,motion,2009-02-04 20:37:00,403,"Guys, I'm sure this has been analyzed to death bud I need some help trying to decide what to buy for some week-end ice fishing out on Lake Simcoe (mainly Perch). I have been looking at a sled and also some quads to haul me and my son. If given and option what would you buy/use?"
301408,anders,2009-02-04 20:42:00,1168,"Simple....sled!  The sled is build for winter, the quad not so much. Plus then, you can take the sled and use it other places in the winter.  In the summer..use your vehicle instead of the quad."
301409,kemper,2009-02-04 20:42:00,2232,I dont know much (anything) about ice fishing but assuming the conditions allowed I would go with a quad. A sled you can only use part of the year whereas the quad you can get full year use out of
301411,motion,2009-02-04 20:46:00,403,I spoke to a friend of mine and he said that a 2 wheel drive quad pulls him and his hut out no problem. The  quad might cost me a bit more. I am looking at a 1986 Moto 4 for about 1200.00.
301415,FSNmachine,2009-02-04 21:11:00,22,The 2wd quad and even 4wd will work some of the time but this winter we have had a lot of snow and the quads have been getting stuck. Even 4x4 trucks are getting stuck on places like Quinte. I analyzed this to death last year and have a sled this year and am sure glad I did. i got a 2up touring sled and can always take a  fishing buddy out with me or the wife a well as tow my Yukon Fishtrap with ease. I have also been out and during the day a pressure crack will open up during the day. On the way in the quad may have more difficultty crossing it than the sled will.
301421,bassjnkie,2009-02-04 21:21:00,1101,"I would say quad, I have the grizzly 350, nice and light and I can use it year round. I am thinking of a set of these http://www.atv-tracks.com/"
301424,Uncle Buck,2009-02-04 21:27:00,1000,"if you're gonna buy a 2WD quad, then go with a sled...  it's give & take....  quad has year round use, sled is winter only...  unless you live up north, winter is only 2-3 months here...  is it worth the investment for the several times a year you'll use it..."
301428,BillM,2009-02-04 21:42:00,17367,"For Simcoe a quad will be fine, just don't plan on taking it anywhere else up north and bushwacking to back lakes"
301432,Terry,2009-02-04 21:45:00,14456,if it's only for winter use skidoo  if you would use it all year round ATV   skidoos don't work well in the summer
301436,motion,2009-02-04 21:52:00,403,Thanks for all your input guys. I am thinking of just using it around Simcoe and I am not into trail riding so I though it might be a waste with a sled for just a few months of use. I figured that a quad might give me the option of using it the rest of the year. I am just unsure of the ability to go through the snow with just a 2 wheel drive system. I was told that as long as I am not planning on plowing with it I should be fine.
301442,2 tone z71,2009-02-04 22:01:00,1311,"my Quad has 2wd /4wd switch, in 2wd unless on a plowed road or in a very small amount of snow,it aint going anywhere,and its got lots of mods lots of power and hungry tires,a snowmobile may be better in your case unless like stated you can use the quad in the summer as well,it also  might be in great cond and I know they hold value but theres no way id put out 1200 for a 23 yr old 2wd"
301446,raysfish2005,2009-02-04 22:12:00,163,"I have a Moto4 250 cc its an 89 two wheel drive. if your going for the Atv just make sure you get a good set of chains for the tires, i used mine on simcoe this weekend,  and the last two weekends, with all the snow on the lake right now its a slow go but it beats walking,I pulled my flip and my little girl out, We did mangage to bog down in the slush a few times but the chains grab and your out. I picked up the qaud because the last few years we have had very little snow on the ice and it burnt off my runners, now i have the quad and its a winter wonder land.  Sleds are faster to get to the fishing grounds but i love the quad for all the gear i can load on it. You can see a pic of my quad on the last clamp-it post for simcoe.   Hope this helps"
301448,ch312,2009-02-04 22:22:00,1590, either you dont know how to drive or you are driving a 90cc atv.  i regularly use a sportsman 500 and a grizzly 660. both have 4x4 on demand but do very well in 2x4 in the mud and foot deep snow. with the grizzly its not too often that i actually need 4x4.  id go with an atv as it can be used year round. but if you have the money just buy both
301452,motion,2009-02-04 22:35:00,403,IUnfortunately I dont have the money or the room to store them both. I think my wife would boot me out if I showed up with both. LOL.

301455,diggyj,2009-02-04 22:41:00,548,I'd go with a quad. More versatile and you can use it in the summer.
301474,Big Cliff,2009-02-04 23:42:00,6899,Had both; sold sled!  The ATV is much more usable 90% of the time. Slush can be a problem out on the lakes but get a sled stuck in the slush.... Not fun!  As long as you don't get the ATV hung up they will dig their way through a lot of stuff.
301477,walleyemaster,2009-02-04 23:52:00,325,"sled..100% pulled a quad out of lake simcoe last weekend..snow was to high quad went nowhere,, guy was kinda embaressed that he was stuck..tied a rope to my SNOWMOBILE he stepped on the gas and pulled him back to shore...not the shore he entered just the closest one.. he then peoceeded to drive back on the road back to his car and home...sleds can cross water if your sled is fast enough... i have a quad and its used for the bush most of the year but when it comes to snow...anytime any place mr.quad... ill get there faster and easier..."
301482,Muskieman,2009-02-05 00:05:00,2472,  Too old too much.... there are better deals to be found.. a little more $$$ and alot better quality.  As for the question you asked ...depends on the amount of snow that is on the lake and are you blazing your own trail..  You wouldn't get too far without a fight on Nipissing right now with a 4 wheeler...or any northern lake for that matter..  In the conditions we have now a sled for sure.  But on the other hand a 4 wheeler ATV can be used year round.  Toss a coin and see how it lands... in my opinion ATV  vs Sled in winter just to go fishing... all depends on the conditions.  RFS 
301488,walleyemaster,2009-02-05 00:20:00,325,you do make some good points randy.... but with a sled you never have to worry about ice conditions its made for it snow or no snow...

I would like to use the toy in the summer so I'm leaning towards a quad.  Where can these ""deals"" on good used quads be had. I thought 1000.00-1200.00 for a used quad might be OK. Anybody have one or know of one for sale?"
301653,Maverick,2009-02-05 04:12:00,371,"you won't get much of a quad for a grand but you can get a decent fish sled for it. You're going to want to spend at least 2000 to get a decent quad, something mid 90s anyway. Keep checkin kijiji and you'll find something that catches your eye."
301658,trapshooter,2009-02-05 04:21:00,1234,"If you're looking for a machine for ice fishing and ice fishing only, it's gotta be a sled.  Quads don't even compare in any amount of slush or deep snow.  Have you entertained the idea of a Quad with tracks for the winter and tires for the other 3 seasons?"
