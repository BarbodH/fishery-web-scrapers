302403,lucabrasi,2009-02-06 18:18:00,114,"WTG guys! 10 years 3 months myself. Breathing better indeed, not to mention feeling and looking better too. IMHO on that last one."
302415,legacey,2009-02-06 18:44:00,127,"I've been 4 years and 2 months coming up on the 8th.  Coincidently to this topic, I woke up this morning, coughed up a lung and said to my wife, ""why did I ever quit....I should go back just to feel better!"" I don't remember coughing like I do now when I did smoke.  I didn't have any trouble quiting and wouldn't go back though.  ....I think they should make a non-smoking patch out of a $10 bill as an incentive to quit. When you buy cigarettes, you have to use it and not debit or credit.  Congrats to all the have given it up and to those that will someday do the same.   Cheers"
302424,Daplumma,2009-02-06 19:27:00,1961,Been over 5 years for cigarettes and 2 years for all forms of tobacco.Nicotine free feels good after the first few months. Joe

302437,lew,2009-02-06 20:31:00,12767,"WTG Ernie, that's fantastic !!  I've been off those filthy stinking things for 18 years now and often wonder how much $$$$ I wasted in the 30 years I was addicted to them before quitting."
302485,Bernie,2009-02-06 22:29:00,3190,Good for you. Feels great doesn't it! Sneaking up on 5 months for me too. Passed the test a couple weeks ago when the guys were up here fishing. O boy it was tempting at times but held off. Few extra bucks in the wallet and a cough free morning. Not to mention I can smell things again.
302527,camillj,2009-02-06 23:34:00,1988,"My second anniversary is March the 4th ... at 10:24 am ... and according to my computer I have saved almost $8,500 and have NOT added 21,600 butts to the environment ... but whos keeping track"
302537,Radnine,2009-02-06 23:50:00,1538," Yeah, unfortunately when the guys come up fishing is not the best time to be able to smell again. Fourteen years, never had a craving. Jim"
302543,npt1,2009-02-07 00:03:00,220,"12 YEARS  smoke free for me, what a great thing, I will add years to my life. It I dont get hit bya bus or anything else---I have created a number of years that my family will have me as a  Grampa. I love our kids and our grand kids))))))))) Lloyd."
302545,Bernie,2009-02-07 00:04:00,3190,True enough! At least in the summer the windows are open and the shower is operational.
302619,Beans,2009-02-07 02:02:00,3339,Good job Ernie...WTG !  I quit when one of our grandsons was born as his parents had already proclaimed their house as off limits for smoking...Ok by me as I was smoking more and enjoying them less...He will be twenty-three this coming July 30th...it was tough at first but I knew as long as I didn't have the first one...it was impossible to have the second...one-day-at-a-time...
302627,Gerritt,2009-02-07 02:09:00,6129,"Congrats!!!... today is day 4 for me.... and was probably my hardest test... Everyone at work smokes... and here I am munching on carrot sticks! LOL.... I am all the better for it though... hell I can have a few beers and to be honest I do not want one!!!.. Cold turkey.. I wished I would have found the motivation  years ago!! not sure what clicked in my head... but something did! and thank god... I am not longer ""trying"" to quit... I am quitting!  G"

302679,Radnine,2009-02-07 03:46:00,1538,"Wrong! You have quit. Remember, the minute you stop you are a non-smoker, not a guy that used to smoke. Congrats to all! Jim"
302680,Radnine,2009-02-07 03:46:00,1538,"Wrong! You have quit. Remember, the minute you stop you are a non-smoker, not a guy that used to smoke. Congrats to all! Jim"
302760,Spiel,2009-02-07 13:43:00,9065," Congratualtions. As a life long smoker who has quit more times than anybody I know I can honestly say, ""quiting is easy, staying off them, not so easy."""
