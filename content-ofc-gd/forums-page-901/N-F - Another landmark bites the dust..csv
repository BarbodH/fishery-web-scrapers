302707,tinbanger,2009-02-07 04:41:00,1028,"can""t fight progress I guess !  nice day for flying wayne , thanks for the pics  TB"
302712,Sinker,2009-02-07 04:47:00,8692,Put out the welcome mat for more city rif raf!! LOL
302737,carp-starter,2009-02-07 06:47:00,253,Has it changed much?  Here is a PIC from before 15 years ago.  carp-starter  
302769,Bob Devine,2009-02-07 14:05:00,251,"I spent a number of summer days swimming the slip as a kid.  At the Tiffin elevators we fished, swam and rode our dirt bikes down there lots too. At one time Cdn music legend Gordon Lightfoot parked his sailboat the ""Golden Goose"" in the Port McNicoll slip. Sorry to see another piece of history leave, the old neighbourhood just doesn't look the same anymore."
302827,irishfield,2009-02-07 16:56:00,26272, Yes.. considering it will be gone by months end! That picture with ships in Port Mc Slip is way older than 15 years old... but a nice shot Carp-starter!  The second shot... you can see the round circle foundation of the old elevator to the left of the new condo unit. Wouldn't ya just love to own the house (for $300K) just 70 feet to the right! lol
302829,mikeh,2009-02-07 16:58:00,824,"Duncan's marina is gone also, I believe they are going to put in housing along the waterfront."
302832,irishfield,2009-02-07 17:01:00,26272,That whole shoreline is going to be developed in Port with eastern oil money! My son's the IT Coordinator for the township of Tay.. I can't say much more.
302835,mikeh,2009-02-07 17:08:00,824,Oil money from oversea's  ?
302837,irishfield,2009-02-07 17:13:00,26272,"Ummm.. yes.. from what I understand. Expensive ""villas"" and multimillion dollar yachts from Dubai etc. Maybe Simcoe county will get lucky and the project will lower everyone else property mill rate! ya right ! lol"
302849,mikeh,2009-02-07 18:04:00,824,"Musky fishermen from Dubai   , That whole shoreline is pretty shallow, they would have to go 1/2 way to Methodist Island to get in 9 feet of water ,it will be interesting to see how far they bring the shoreline out."
302861,irishfield,2009-02-07 18:51:00,26272,But not if they use the ship slip! lol.. I hear yah Mike.. but get ready for lots of pretty eyes in Port McNicol.
