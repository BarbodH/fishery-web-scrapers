The Dusey river was just phenominal.  Walleye and pike fishing in the lake and parts of the river was just as good.  Fantastic cabin as well with a Bosch on demand hot water heater.  I'll have something posted by next week."
705289,chris.brock,2012-06-13 02:29:00,4053,"wow, possibly the best fly-in you've done? should be a cool report, I've said it before, I'm going to say it again, you're a lucky guy, I'm jealous again"
705292,HTHM,2012-06-13 02:33:00,4082,"Nah, I'd say he has earned 'em."
705294,solopaddler,2012-06-13 02:41:00,8605,"  Excellent, that's what I'm aiming for. LOL!   Maybe you can join me on one of these trips sometime."
