704805,Broker,2012-06-11 21:05:00,482,So what has everyone made to do with fishing? Post your pictures of your neat things you've made !
704819,Rod Caster,2012-06-11 21:38:00,5784,My anchor is made from rope and a rock! Does that count? Haha. I make my own leaders and harness spinners too... They seem to hold up to the test of time quite well. I'll try to post a photo if I get time.
704820,Leecher,2012-06-11 21:40:00,7832,"I've made lots of wooden lures and ice rods in the past... here's some of my work  Tipups      Mini version    Spooks, cranks, jitterbug and popper                            and last but not least... The Plaque!!!    TroutJunkie"

704825,Leecher,2012-06-11 21:55:00,7832," Thanks shasta!!!  The rods work real well, balanced & sensitive good for any species of fish, I love'em  Nowadays, I make spinnerbaits and slip bobber type rigs"
704833,Broker,2012-06-11 22:09:00,482,"Must keep ya real busy! Thinking about getting into something like that, need something to do on rainy days like today .."

704840,Broker,2012-06-11 22:27:00,482,"Actually never saw that, you make some real nice lures too!"
704847,Billy Bob,2012-06-11 22:43:00,5865,I make all my own worm harnesses....but I'm sure most guys here do.....  I have also tied about a 1000 bucktail jigs.....use to sell them to bait shops years ago....  I also made these contraptions but don't use them much anymore.....     Plus my ice fish finder box....       And also this........  
704854,Broker,2012-06-11 22:58:00,482,Those last twp pictures are very creative
704858,Leecher,2012-06-11 23:09:00,7832, Here's the new stuff I make now and not from wood but the real deal    Closer shots          TroutJunkie

704876,ccmtcanada,2012-06-12 00:06:00,7971,"My stuff isn't ""pretty""....I'm not good at that, but I can make some functional things! LOL.  I can't even come close to the baits people make on here but I have a table saw and I can use it if I have to!  A while ago, when I had a canoe, I made a stabilizer arm for it out of scrap wood, a few c clamps and some styrofoam I got cheap.  Everything was held together with wing nuts and bolts for easy assembly. Here are the pictures.            I also made a motor stand for my first outboard...once again, using spare 2x4s and a 2x8 and purchasing 4 casters, I came up with this...    "
705117,Float Buddha,2012-06-12 17:37:00,20,"   Here are some floats I've made. The first two are asian style floats, I've been having a blast using them on carp this year. The next three are some simple balsa wagglers. The last two are traditional goose quills. I like to use them for perch and other pannies.."
705121,Spiel,2012-06-12 17:45:00,9065,"Lures, Flies, Jigs, Floats, Rods, Wading Staffs, Boat Mods and likely much more over the years. It`d take me a month of Sundays to post pictures.  But I`ve also noted over the years there`s no lack of amazing talent on this forum."
705133,adolson,2012-06-12 18:05:00,783,I made only one lure when I was a kid. I made a spoon using a spoon. I bent it repeatedly until the handle came off and then drilled holes. I didn't catch anything with it.
705135,lew,2012-06-12 18:11:00,12766,"Howzbout a big ole wooden box for carrying all my 10"" Boo-Tails  It's not fancy but it keeps everything in it's place and the air holes let the baits dry out after a day of fishing.  I no longer have this box but it was something like 12 x 20 x 12    "
705156,mercman,2012-06-12 19:04:00,7054, I dunno Lew.....looks alot like a jewlery box to me:whistling:
705157,Billy Bob,2012-06-12 19:15:00,5865," YEP.......I agree......maybe we should start a  store called ""Custom Crap for the Fishermen"".........  ....it's catchy.....get it....."
705159,lew,2012-06-12 19:16:00,12766, The price of some of those baits could be compared to jewellery too Paul
705290,HTHM,2012-06-13 02:30:00,4082,"Here is a couple of things that I helped make:  A small project at a fishing camp up north - ALL THE CREDIT FOR THE CRAFTSMANSHIP GOES TO SKUD, I just helped.  As it was when (w)he started:     When we left:     Inside view:     And of course my boat:  From this:      To this over the course of a year:   "
705297,Broker,2012-06-13 02:46:00,482,That small cabin is amazing! Is it finished yet?
