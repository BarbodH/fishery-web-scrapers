705477,jedimaster,2012-06-13 19:14:00,3472,Just wondering if anyone know a place I can get a couple good quality fuji sic tips for a couple rods I have? I need ot replace one on one of my St.Croix's and one of my shimano's. Looking for something in the east endof toronto preferably. Aikman's is a bit of pita for me to get to.

Tips are on and I am a happy camper. I think I am going to pick up some epoxy to cover up the edge of the new guides, or should I use clear nail pollish?"
