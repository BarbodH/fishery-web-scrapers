705072,bucktail,2012-06-12 15:39:00,1857,Finally go enough cash together for a HDS-8 Combo and ws wondering if anyone had heard of any Lowrance sales coming up. Its a lot of money and I dont want to spend all the dough and have it come on sale the week after.  Any Lowrance staffers on here?   Thanks  Darren
705076,Lunker777,2012-06-12 15:57:00,866,sounds like a broken record but give Jos @ angling outfitters a call. Best price/service from my point of view.

705721,bucktail,2012-06-14 11:51:00,1857,Now I just have to figure out how to move my LMS 337 up to the front and find an adapter so I can plug it into my MinnKota Maxxum. I think a call to Lowrance in Missisauga is in order. That and an order of Doc Sampson DVD for it. Can i eneter screenshots of fish into the tourney??? LOL
