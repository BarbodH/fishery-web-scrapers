705847,TDunn,2012-06-14 17:56:00,680,"Hey OFC! It been a busy summer so far for me! Lots of fishing! I ended my steelhead season in the boat on the St. Marys. The first evening we were welcomed with a fish or double on every drift. I think by drift 7 we had 10+ fish in the boat.        Nice double!          Headed back out a few nights later and we hit a few fish but no numbers like the previous outing. Did land this big female...just shy of 32""     Next we tried an inland lake where we did well for walleye this winter. We started pulling spinners over tops of the weeds and quickly found ourselves hammering perch/panfish. Pulled out a slip bobber and had some fun for an hour or two. After we got tired of catching pannies we returned to searching for eyes... Stayed right til dark but came up empty handed. I Landed a few nice OOS smallie up to 20"" and Ted landed this beautiful pike.    Next up was our trip up to Lake Nipigon! A full week of relaxing, eating and of course world class fishing. Fishing was awesome but there was times throughout the days where you had to work for them. Small spoons were hot at the start of our trip and jig flies were the ticket towards the end. Chuck from nipigon baits (OFC member) had sent me up some jig flies a few years ago. I decided to pop into his shop and he fixed me up again with some more dynamite jig flies. If your heading up to Nipigon hit him up! PM if you want more info....                    A great fish to start with...                          Casting the shorelines of islands 14km out into the lake! We watched this tank take my spoon boatside!                                            Fish/bacon sandwiches!              This laker took my jig fly a foot below the surface and went straight down!      Part 2 is much smaller and will be up very soon!   TDunn"
