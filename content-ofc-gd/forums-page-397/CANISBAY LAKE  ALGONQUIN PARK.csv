705552,DMASSE,2012-06-13 22:10:00,420,"Hello  Was thinking of doing a 3 day fishing trip to CANISBAY Lake in ALGONQUIN Park,  Has anyone fished there before. Is there any good spots or what typr of fish are there.  I am kayaking but dont want to portage to much due to personal health..  Any help would be appreciated  Dave"
705559,spincast,2012-06-13 22:44:00,3279,"Many moons ago. Didnt have much time for fishing when I was there, but what I did was tough. Caught one nice trout, about 2 lbs trolling behind the canoe for about 5 hours of effort over 2 days. Like most of the drive in lakes, pressure has pretty much decimate any chance of catching much. Great campground though (or used to be 10+ years ago)"
705567,woodenboater,2012-06-13 22:56:00,2277,"if you're going to Algonquin drive in, I'd look at Rock Lake instead. Bass in the lake but downside is the campground can get noisy so be forewarned  Rain Lake is another nice spot, they had a small campground years ago but not sure if it still exists. There's a cabin the Park rents out as well. Rain Lake is one of my favorites in the Park and I believe Ralph Bice or his family have or had a cabin at the far end of the lake. Again bass is what I've caught there. Very pretty lake and around 5 km or so long, but thin at the west end.  Have fun where ever you camp."
705568,Christopheraaron,2012-06-13 22:58:00,3525,"Opeongo is quite if you get a water taxi to take you in, big smallies and lakers."
705692,Stoty,2012-06-14 10:21:00,2910, Opeongo is the most pressured/used lake in the park due to it being one of the only lakes that allows unlimited horsepower.... I wouldn't say it's quiet....
705710,Christopheraaron,2012-06-14 11:29:00,3525,"Doesn't say quiet it says quite, but it should say ""quite nice""."
705711,Stoty,2012-06-14 11:31:00,2910, That makes more sense.... lol
705796,Musky or Specks,2012-06-14 15:22:00,2710,The campsite at Tea Lake might not be open but the smallmouth fishing is decent there and if you camp at Cannisbay its not that far of a run
705941,chris.brock,2012-06-14 23:07:00,4053,"if you've got 3 days, it's a further drive, you're still in the park, Kiosk has good smallie fishing for a drive to, no portaging campground, quieter and a better vibe than the hwy 60 stuff"
705997,mirogak,2012-06-15 02:54:00,387, Tea Lake is open my friends ... hit it.  Its one of my favs.  Good spots for Bass fishin' for sure.  I actually flipped my sit-in kayak last summer chasing this one Big Bass splashing around.....
