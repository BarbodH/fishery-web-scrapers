705917,livinisfishin,2012-06-14 21:39:00,661,I've used a pelican pursuit 100 sit in kayak for fishing quite a few times. I really don't mind it at all. I found that after a while out that my lower back would get sore.  For the price of the kayak and what I need it for it works.  Iv

They've worked well for us,the storage compartment is better than anything else I've seen in it's class and it has a few nice extras-like waterproof storage bag. The one thing I would have liked is a slightly larger cockpit .I found it somewhat difficult/uncomfortable to pull my legs up enough to make exiting easy.We're using them in Northern Ontario in May and are usually dressed warm with raingear as well-so we're a bit bulked up. For the price you can't go wrong and it comes with a decent paddle!"
