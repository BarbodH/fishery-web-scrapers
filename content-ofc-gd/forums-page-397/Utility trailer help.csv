703307,baironhorse,2012-06-06 14:53:00,145,I got a 4x6 snowbear utility tailer and want to know what bearing kit and size of bearing buddies are to be used with a 1 1/16 axle? Hopefully not a stupid question and ur assistance would be appreciated. Thx
703451,pikeguy,2012-06-06 23:19:00,195,since this trailer is bought from Canadian tire i would go there and ask them and they can sell the right one to you as well. Best of luck
703511,GYPSY400,2012-06-07 04:43:00,191,"The trailer section at canadian tire or princess auto has bearing kits for both 1"" and 1 1/16"" spindle sizes."
704535,baironhorse,2012-06-11 04:01:00,145,Ok so the axle size will determine size of bearing kit to use...correct?
704935,pikeguy,2012-06-12 02:26:00,195,typed in Snowbear  trailer brought me to Canadian tier looked at the 4x6 trailer clicked specifications and it said 1 1/16  go check it out if you want and see if its the same trailer as yours.
704973,GYPSY400,2012-06-12 09:45:00,191," Yes, the spindle diameter deems the bearing size. Most small trailers are 1"" or 1 1/16"".. Best thing to do is disassemble and get a bearing out so you can see what number is on the roller bearing as its hard to distinguish the 1/16"" difference."
