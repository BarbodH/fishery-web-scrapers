705082,Spanky80,2012-06-12 16:05:00,152,Congratulations!  She sure has been well cared for!
705101,ah_long,2012-06-12 16:55:00,354," 30% power is all you need.. the extra power is when I want to cut thru the weeds...  when you have a buddy that's pissing you off.. you tell him look over the side of the boat, put the trolling in full power.. and you know the rest"
705136,Grimace,2012-06-12 18:12:00,2020,"Great looking rig.  Congrats, and enjoy!"
705150,capt bruce,2012-06-12 18:34:00,820," Or even better wait untill they need to heed the call of nature .. I know Im twice as old as you , but can you adopt me . Nice ride a great find someone sure took great care of her ."
705154,JoshS,2012-06-12 18:52:00,729,"Nice boat man!! I got mine in Michigan too for (what I think was) an awesome deal, way less expensive then what used boats were going for north of the border.  The site I used the most was jaxed.com which used to scour ebay, craigslist, kijiji - but I think craigslist is now banned on the site. I used to type ""sitemash lund"" into google - for example if I was looking for a Lund - and use the first jaxed link that pops up.  Where did you get the cover done?"
705293,SRT8 smoker craft,2012-06-13 02:37:00,1107,Man that 2000 looks exactly the same as my 2011 and might even be a bit cleaner LOL
705295,mercman,2012-06-13 02:42:00,7054,beautiful Ride ! Use it well and be safe.
696427,ah_long,2012-05-15 04:55:00,354,"So finally got a new to me boat. She's a 2000 Monark King 160. 0.100 gauge all welded hull.  Really clean boat, got her from Michigan.  50hp Merc ELPTO gets her up to around 32MPH with 3 people in the boat. Already upgraded the trolling motor to a 24V Maxxum 74# w/ Universal Sonar.  Boat is really clean for its age.  Now all I need to do is to add a float switch, install another deep cycle battery, install a battery charger and get a cover for it.  Here's a quick snap of her...   "
696428,lew,2012-05-15 07:26:00,12766,"Congrats on  the new boat, it appears to have been well maintained."
696442,Wolf 3,2012-05-15 11:34:00,134,Very nice! Congrats!

696461,RangerGuy,2012-05-15 12:36:00,564,Wow that boat is in great shape!..She looks brand new.. Congrats on an awesome find!
696463,woodenboater,2012-05-15 12:39:00,2277,"Super sweet boat. If this were a car, it would only have been driven on Sundays to church"
696464,cityfisher,2012-05-15 12:43:00,959,Nice ... Love the US  lots of cheaper boats!
696480,ah_long,2012-05-15 13:25:00,354,This is also the smoothest border crossing I've done as well.  In and out in less than 15 minutes. Props to the officers @ the Sarnia border.  Also a shout out to all the folks on OFC who steered me away from the Princecraft in Harrisburg PA so I could land on this Beauty.
696482,Flappn,2012-05-15 13:28:00,245,Nice grab. Great looking boat!
696749,Mike the Pike,2012-05-16 03:50:00,3421,great looking ride and its so squeaky clean.  enjoy now get it slimed and show us some fish pix
696751,ohhenrygsr,2012-05-16 03:55:00,947,WOOOO
696812,tb4me,2012-05-16 13:43:00,3295,How was it getting it across the border? I know you said it was a breeze but did you have to have any special paper work?
696845,ah_long,2012-05-16 15:46:00,354,"nothing special..  make sure you have these items at hand  trailer title bill of sale (with break down of boat and trailer) boat title  and that's it  if you can print out a copy of the internet ad, it would help in case customs are questioning. It's also helpful when crossing the border to the US to explain what you're doing.  it's the second time I've imported a boat from the US and I can say that it's not as intimidating as many think.  btw, transport canada has a great bill of sale template that you can use. Just remember to add a trailer portion to it."
696850,BillM,2012-05-16 15:54:00,17367,Our border crossing in the Sault was also painless when be brought back our Lund.  In and out in about 10 mins..

705060,ah_long,2012-06-12 14:58:00,354,"Just got the boat into the water with the new top gun cover  The cover is just a work of art. No complaints at all. The shop that did the cover did an amazing job, details are all there. Reinforcement at proper places. Just nice.  First time this boat is out on a Canadian lake. First fish caught was a double header OOS bass between me and my regular fishing buddy. Hopefully this is a sign of what's to come for bass season 2012.  Caught two over slot walleye as well.  With two people, gear, and 20 Gallons of gas, it runs nicely @ 30mph with light chop.         "
