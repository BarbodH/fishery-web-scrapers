705772,beagle dad,2012-06-14 14:33:00,224,newfoundland hitch---way to tie fly so it tracks differently in water...great for atlantics  and brookies  
705777,torco,2012-06-14 14:42:00,656,"You will be fine as others have said. You can even add some shot to get it down deeper. Also you can simply swing the fly as sometimes fish do not seem to want it striped in.  Make a cast quartering down stream, and mend if necessary to slow the fly down and just the let current take it. This will cause the fly to swing until the line is directly below you downstream. Before recasting it let it sit there for a couple pauses often fish take it at this time.  google wet fly swing for a video or a better explanation."
705786,fish_finder,2012-06-14 14:54:00,370," This ^^  And get yourself some sinktips as well, you'll be happy...."
705874,Dabluz,2012-06-14 18:51:00,701,"If you want your fly to sink a bit faster, you can use a fluorocarbon leader.  To fish nymphs like wooly buggers, you cast but you keep the rod pointed to where the leader or line has entered the water.  When the fish picks up the fly, it will hook itself.  Using a floating line for river fishing is great because you can vary the length of the leader according to the depth of the water."
706168,SirCranksalot,2012-06-15 19:04:00,3291,"I guess it's different strokes for different folks, but I'm taken aback by the number of people who adulterate freshly caught fish by adding other stuff to it. It seems a bit like 'chicken fried"" steak you get down south i.e battered."
706169,misfish,2012-06-15 19:09:00,29133,"So Davey,did ya get out? I,ll be out this weekend. Give a shout if ya want to hook up."
706171,capt bruce,2012-06-15 19:27:00,820,  ?????????? what you talking about willis ?????? your point sir !
706203,misfish,2012-06-15 22:32:00,29133, Think he posted in the wrong thread B.  Made no sense to me as well.
706261,Christopheraaron,2012-06-16 02:42:00,3525,Probably in the walleye recipes thread.
705486,davey buoy,2012-06-13 19:38:00,5505,"Picked up a couple of wooly buggers and such. Read the packaging and couldn't find out what they were good for. After getting home and used 'THE GOOGLE"" LOL.,found out they are wet. Any problem using them with a dry set up/floating ?.Thanks."
705491,Jacob,2012-06-13 19:42:00,186,"You will be able to fish them in up to about 10ft of water with a long leader, just use a stronger tippet."
705496,davey buoy,2012-06-13 19:47:00,5505," It's a 8 weight set up,9' leader and tippet to size. I guess it would sink fast, and have to be ready to retrieve?"
705500,John,2012-06-13 19:54:00,2956,What kind of water are you fishing with that set up?
705502,davey buoy,2012-06-13 19:56:00,5505, River in my neck of the woods.
705503,misfish,2012-06-13 19:57:00,29133,"  I KNOW,I KNOW,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"
705509,Christopheraaron,2012-06-13 20:11:00,3525,"If it's the same one that Brian fishes, there are lots of deep pools by the looks of it. They will sink, and can catch almost any species using any technique, slow strip, fast strip, dead drifted or I would think worked under a float."
705510,davey buoy,2012-06-13 20:14:00,5505," I,m not sure if it' the same one,but thanks for the encouragement."
705512,Broker,2012-06-13 20:18:00,482,She should work just fine with a long enough leader!
705513,Christopheraaron,2012-06-13 20:19:00,3525,IMO I think it looks most natural with quick short strips.
705514,davey buoy,2012-06-13 20:20:00,5505," 9',that seems like a decent length?I think."
705515,misfish,2012-06-13 20:22:00,29133,"Dave,you stay away from my deep pools.LOL"
705517,kickingfrog,2012-06-13 20:24:00,8333,"  Do you mean a floating fly line? No issues on small streams (as stated above). If you are using a floating line while on a ""deep"" lake or pond (10 plus feet) to cast or troll, it really works much better if you use a sinking line."
705518,davey buoy,2012-06-13 20:24:00,5505, LMAO!!!!!!!!!!!!:rofl2::rofl2:
705520,davey buoy,2012-06-13 20:28:00,5505, It is a floating line and for the river for a while.No plans for the lake yet. Thanks. I did hear 10' seems to be the go to spot as far as changing from floating to sinking
705525,jedimaster,2012-06-13 20:40:00,3472,On a bit of a side note. Whats the difference between dry and wet flies? does one sink and one float?
705527,davey buoy,2012-06-13 20:45:00,5505," Yes,dry"" floats"" and wet ""sinks."""
705528,jedimaster,2012-06-13 20:47:00,3472,"Thanks, and sorry for th hijack, just an ignorant non fly fisher question, I have heard the terms many time and kinda just brushed it asside."
705529,davey buoy,2012-06-13 20:49:00,5505," Not a problem,were all hear to learn!!"
705544,Christopheraaron,2012-06-13 21:49:00,3525,"Terms:  Dry fly- floating fly wet fly-sinking fly streamer-wet fly that has a streamlined shape terrestrial- a bug that spends it's life on the ground, like an ant or beetle pool- a deep calm spot in a river rapids- fast flowing turbulent water in the river run- a fast flowing pool eddie- a small calm spot behind an obstruction in the flow of water oxbow- a large ""bow"" in the shape of a river, usually creates large pools fly line- the main line leader- the tapered line that is tied to your fly line tippet- sort of like an extra leader that is tied to your actual leader, means that you don't have to constantly replace your leader stripping- the motion of pulling in line to animate the fly dead drift- letting the fly drift down the river with no extra movement backing- the wider section of fly backing before is starts to taper, makes it easier to cast distances back cast- the step in the cast where the line is behind you false cast- casting without landing the fly, the purpose; to get line out hatch- what bugs or insects the fish are feeding on at that time riffles- shallow water flowing over rocks"
705554,davey buoy,2012-06-13 22:16:00,5505, Great information for sure!!!
705558,misfish,2012-06-13 22:44:00,29133, I googled that too.
705561,Christopheraaron,2012-06-13 22:46:00,3525,"Thanks, almost forgot these:  attractor fly- a fly that does not imitate a specific food item but rather attracts the fish to it so they feed instinctively usually used for picky salmon pattern- what the fly is, for example a mayfly pattern roll cast- a way of casting which doesn't require a back cast strike indicator- basically a bobber for flies floating line- I think you can guess this one sinking line- pretty simple mend- lifting or flipping the line so that it's upstream of your fly And some flies that everyone should know:  Wooly bugger goddard caddis brassie pheasant tail nymph adams dry bunny strip leach scud clouser minnow lefty's deceiver marabou muddler daves hopper royal wulff humpy"
705671,Musky or Specks,2012-06-14 04:13:00,2710,"Chuck and duck my friend. I fish all kinds of streamers on floating fly lines. I will even put a decent size split shot 6 "" up from the fly to get it deeper and a more erratic action."
705767,BillM,2012-06-14 14:08:00,17367,"I fish everything on a WF floating line..  Big streamers, wets, dries, nymphing, you name it.."
