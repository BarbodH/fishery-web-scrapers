706234,manitoubass2,2012-06-16 00:24:00,11391, Absolutely!   
706237,hammercarp,2012-06-16 00:48:00,964,This kind of stuff has become standard for them. The more outrageous it it the better. Look how much free publicity they get from every fishing forum that picks it up and posts it. There is no such thing as bad publicity. The more hits they get from it the more money they get.
706244,G.mech,2012-06-16 01:46:00,830,    I take offense to that comment!!!!  What are you thinking???
705836,Musky or Specks,2012-06-14 17:25:00,2710,
705837,Terry,2012-06-14 17:29:00,14456,?
705840,mistaredone,2012-06-14 17:39:00,913,I think the link is broken?
705841,jigsnreels,2012-06-14 17:39:00,133,Link is dead.
705843,misfish,2012-06-14 17:42:00,29133,"Search,it,s in there. Under news.   P3TA supports its protest of sport fishing and parents who teach their children to fish."
705845,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2012-06-14 17:51:00,535,Hahaha. That's rich!
705861,fishindevil,2012-06-14 18:19:00,6254,"P3TA !!!!!   STANDS FOR ""PEOPLE EATING TASTY ANIMALS""   WHAT A BUNCH OF IDIOTS  THEY ARE !!!!"
705864,BillM,2012-06-14 18:21:00,17367,"Jacksonville, Florida.. Sucks to be them!"
705909,mike rousseau,2012-06-14 21:09:00,4661,"idiots...  dont they do any research on the issues they want to protest....  ""catching a fish is the same as putting a hook in your dog and dragging it behind the car..."" yeah...ok..."
705912,misfish,2012-06-14 21:19:00,29133,"LOL MM That,s my fish,get your hook out of him.  TOTAL BULL"
705935,Billy Bob,2012-06-14 22:44:00,5865,Rednecks LOVE P3TA folks.......they make great moving/running targets once all the varmints have been reduce in these parts.......
705937,Handlebarz,2012-06-14 22:50:00,3790,I just hope I dont have a run in with any of them as it will not be so nice. If it were not for fishing just think where so many of us would be I know I would have never lasted as long as I have and I am sure there are many here who would be out causing crap and being a low life sticking there noses into places it should not be. Oh wait maybe that is the problem there parents never had time for them and they are rebelling against the ones who had a great childhood.  Either way P3TA SUCKS
705948,Weeds,2012-06-14 23:36:00,782,On the plus side it's nice to know at least one  group exists that everyone can bash the hell out of without any fear of reprisal or thread lockdown.
705950,manitoubass2,2012-06-14 23:38:00,11391,"I think of P3TA as a bunch of people who need something to feel involved. It seems to be a collection of bored people looking for something to do, that don't get along with others and have little to no meaning in their own lives.  Sort of like those people that gossip even amongst their so called friends. They jump on anything, researched or not, and just run with it.  To say they as a group lack credibility, would be a major understatement...  Anyhow, back to not knowing/or caring what P3TA is up to"
705982,skidoosafari,2012-06-15 01:37:00,46, X2 on what he said  
705995,mirogak,2012-06-15 02:49:00,387,What about them vegetarians ... aren't plants living things too? ....
706016,Stoty,2012-06-15 03:55:00,2910, x3!!
706034,Big Cliff,2012-06-15 09:30:00,6899,"I just want some of those cute ones to do a nude protest, I'd even let them use my dock (if they were really cute)!"
706037,Stoty,2012-06-15 09:52:00,2910,"Be careful what you wish for Cliff...... From what I've gathered, those ""treehugging"" women like things ALL NATURAL... if you know what I'm sayin! Things could get quite ""hairy"" at your dock!"
706136,Tybo,2012-06-15 16:01:00,1373, How do you think religion got started.
706141,Rod Caster,2012-06-15 16:22:00,5784, Ha! Well played sir.
706157,ch312,2012-06-15 17:58:00,1590,  and i'll second that
706175,Muskieman,2012-06-15 19:54:00,2472,And a third .  Why do we at OFC spell it P3TA and not P(e)TA ? What did I miss ?
706177,Terry,2012-06-15 20:01:00,14456,"it is because it confuses google if we use their name, it gets their name many more hits which gives them more credibility .....went in reality they are little more then a fringe terrorist group that a few actors became their spokes persons and newspapers hopped on board"
706178,Spiel,2012-06-15 20:02:00,9065, Bingo!
