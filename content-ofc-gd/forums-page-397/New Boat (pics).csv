705830,dave524,2012-06-14 17:01:00,4508,"Very nice  bought a 18' aluminum fishing boat 30 years ago, today I would still say it was the best choice. Recognizing the neighbourhood, I am a little shocked you don't have it outfitted as a great lakes troller, being 5 minutes from a lauch ramp. Different stokes for different folks"
705996,moparhawk,2012-06-15 02:50:00,146,Welcome to the Smokercraft family! I bought my ProMag ( 162) new in 98. The fit and finish still looks great today. Thats one heck of a rig.

Went with the Suzuki 140hp, Terrova with i-pilot and US2 and a 587ci for the front and a 597ci for the console.  Thanks to everyone who offered advice over the past few years while I planned this out!  I definitely got a lot of helpful information!          "
