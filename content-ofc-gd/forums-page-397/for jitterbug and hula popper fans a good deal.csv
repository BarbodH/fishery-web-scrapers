They were all 9.98, then I came across a 3 pack ( 2 jitterbugs and 1 hula popper) for 14.99 yes they are Arbogast .....score 1/2 price ...they only come in the same colours in each package but they are good ones green frog/white belly jitter,black jitter and coach dog hula. IMHO these are the 2 best top waters and the price makes them even better. Watch out Restoule smallies and musky."
