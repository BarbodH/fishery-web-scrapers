We were getting them very fast.......many double headers.......so I decided to try out a Gulp Minnow that looked like a Lake Erie Emerald Shiner....never caught a fish on it all while the real minnow kept catching fish.  We caught about 15 or so Gobies and a few throw back perch.......nothing else.  GOOD LUCK and GO FISHING,  BOb"
706063,mike rousseau,2012-06-15 12:04:00,4661,Nice catch...  As for the gulp... As a hook and bait set up gulp is hit and miss... But gulp being jigged...casted... Trolled... Etc where it's a more aggressive method... That's when this stuff shines... Try those gulp minnows on your worm harnesses for walleye... Or on a jig/float for crappies... They do work...really well...
706064,Pikeslayer,2012-06-15 12:06:00,1443,I heard a rumour that Billy Bob actually paid for some bait yesterday  :whistling:

706114,Billy Bob,2012-06-15 14:41:00,5865,The bait deal told us he just got back from Buffalo and bait is getting hard to find in the N. River.......HUGE LIE I was thinking as he was counting out our bait.....I took only one dip and had twice as much as he sold us for $7.....
