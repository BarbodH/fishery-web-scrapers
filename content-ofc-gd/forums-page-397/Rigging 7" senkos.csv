705490,BucktownAngler,2012-06-13 19:41:00,582,"just curious how those of you who use 7"" senkos rig them up.  i usually use the 5"" rigged wacky style using a rubber ring on a weedless gamagatsu hook  does anybody fish the 7"" wacky style? if so, what kind of hook do you use on it?  or are you limited to texas rigging or carolina rigging these big baits?   im thinking its gonna be hard to get a solid hook up unless youre using a big enough hook for these"
705495,Jacob,2012-06-13 19:47:00,186,"I use them wacky style with a rubber ring as you would with the 5"", as for the hook i use a trokar hook, i don't know the model but they're the smallest they carry, i think, they come in a few different sizes.  They work great for big, lazy largies."
705501,bdox,2012-06-13 19:55:00,329,"I throw these, both weighted (3/16) and unweighted. I use a 7/0 EWG hook, and modified Texas rig.  When I put the hook vertically through the head, I try and exit about 1.5"" from down the bait and finish like normal.  This is not the most durable way to hook them, as the line will end up slicing trough the 1.5"" at the top, but it gives it an amazing action. On the descent, the head of the bait will actually wiggle a bit, along with the tail. when your twitching or using the rise-fall method, you can really take advantage of the wobbly head."
705511,BucktownAngler,2012-06-13 20:16:00,582," where do you find a rubber ring large enough?  im surprised the small hook you use works well, i was thinking something bigger would be better"
705521,Jacob,2012-06-13 20:29:00,186,"These are the hooks, they come in a lot of sizes.  As for the rings i use this, the ""super"" one works great with most o-rings.  Jacob"
705532,BucktownAngler,2012-06-13 20:58:00,582," awesome thanks!  i didnt know they made a ""super"" larger wacky tool"
705534,Roy,2012-06-13 21:04:00,13728,Hey you can just buy the rings and use the inside of an old pen as the tool. You could even use dental elastics instead of the rings.
705537,Jacob,2012-06-13 21:29:00,186, That's what I used to use but the elastics are too stretchy and I find they slid off the hook or break too easily but it's a great idea if you wan to save some money
705538,aplumma,2012-06-13 21:30:00,6896,I use O rings they are cheap from the plumbing warehouse.   Art
705541,misfish,2012-06-13 21:42:00,29133,"Heres what I found effective.  Thread the worm on a #1 hook.Right down to about an inch from the tail end.(yes the worm will be on the line) No weight. Pierce the hook in the back of the worm.Let the worm just scewrm down slowly. I love doing this in lilly pads.it,s deadly."
705571,manitoubass2,2012-06-13 23:07:00,11391,"  Uh oh, it's the start of a new bass craze! Wobbly Heading, bwahahaha.  Some great suggestions in this thread for sure. I've used various methods/hooks etc, and I actually prefer to ""wacky rig"" on a light jig head (walleye jig or roundhead jig)  "
705573,misfish,2012-06-13 23:15:00,29133,Get the wieght stuff out of your heads
705791,HTHM,2012-06-14 15:15:00,4082,"These suggestions are great, how about some pictures of the various presentations?"
705797,Harrison,2012-06-14 15:23:00,2202,I texpose rig them.  Use a 4/0 riggin or preferably Owner J hook and either a nail or screw in a 1/16 weight.

705860,d_paluch,2012-06-14 18:18:00,343,"I must say, I think we should start a thread for every style of bait and have you guys comment on how to use them with different techniques!  I absolutely loved the spinnerbait thread, and it gave me confidence to throw them for pike, needless to say the pike fishing has never been better! I have learned a bunch from the lipless crank thread, and now this? Love it!  I wish I could give some advice to help out but my fishing techniques are lacking"
705919,BucktownAngler,2012-06-14 21:48:00,582,"Doing some googling i came across this page Yamamoto Baits for Mexico  these guys use zip ties as a O-ring on their 7"" senkos   "
