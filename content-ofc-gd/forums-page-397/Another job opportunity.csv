Unfortunatly due to personal reasons I am not in a position to continue to do the work necessary to continue to grow this network but I am willing to hand it over to someone.  You must have a background in fishing/hunting and sales. Love meeting and helping people and be self motivated.  There would be some traveling involved but the money is good (well above average income) if you are willing to work at it. Anyone interested, please email me for more details.  [emailÂ protected]"
