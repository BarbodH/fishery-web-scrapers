705597,Hooked,2012-06-14 00:19:00,891,"I am looking at buying a reconditioned\used deep cycle battery for my transom mount trolling motor.  I only use it for a minimum of 2 weeks per year, so if I can get a good used one, that would be great. I checked at the Interstate store here in Stoney Creek but the guy said he only got 3 all year.  Of course they went stat.  Does anybody know of another place that may sell them in the Hamilton area?"

Their refurb's are usually batteries that have a little nick in them from the assembly line. Should be around 50-60 bucks and they will give you $5 for your old one. They also come with the standard 2 year warranty. Can't go wrong. Call them first and see if they have any. Let me know how much you payed."
