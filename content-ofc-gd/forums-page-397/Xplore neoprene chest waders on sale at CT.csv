706125,Brettiop,2012-06-15 15:22:00,279,"I had them, im sure they would work well in most conditions, but if you plan on bushwhacking  a bunch....dont buy them lol  Mine tore to shreds on sticks...every trip out they got worse and worse....Mine were retired after 2 weeks"
706131,Sinker,2012-06-15 15:44:00,8692,"I tried a pair as well. I used them for early season duck hunting, and they lasted me 2 seasons. Keep in mind, I only wore them about 6 times before they started to fall apart and leak. They're OK for light stuff, but if you want something that will last, get something better.  With waders, I look for full replacement warranty. They always seem to get a leak, no matter how well made they are. The full replacement for a year is the way to go if you can find it.  S."

Wasn't planning on doing a lot of bushwhacking so will give them a try...Wanted a pair to use when helping out the local conservation authority with fish identification/sampling projects and of course the occasional time out in the spring for trout.... Had an old pair that I havent touched for years but it has leaks...Now that I'm trying to be more active in the community i figured i'd treat myself to a new one that might actually serve its purpose..  Thanks again for the advice. Cheers! Nigel
