705782,TJQ,2012-06-14 14:50:00,7806,"OFAH supports motion to hold recreational fishing summit  Concerns about recently erected ""no fishing"" signs on city property along the Toronto waterfront were addressed on Tuesday. City Council Executive Committee approved a motion by Councillor Paula Fletcher that recognizes the importance of sport fishing, and directs City staff to remove the signs. Toronto City Council must approve the recommendation made by the Executive Committee on July 11, 2012.  This issue came to a head when city staff put up signs banning fishing along the waterfront without consultation with council or stakeholders.  ""The OFAH appreciates the efforts of Councillor Paula Fletcher and Councillor Adam Vaughan for their leadership on this issue. On behalf of our members, we sent a strongly worded letter of support to Councillor Fletcher and the members of the Executive Committee, urging them to adopt her motion,"" said Greg Farrant, Manager of Government Affairs and Policy. ""The OFAH is particularly pleased to support the creation of a fishing summit and looks forward to participating in future discussions around fishing in the City of Toronto, including issues around fishing access on properties controlled by other agencies and levels of government.""  The Executive Committee recommends that: City Council request the General Manager of Parks, Forestry and Recreation, with assistance from the Waterfront Secretariat and Waterfront Toronto, to arrange a ""Fishing Summit"" on shoreline fishing within the central waterfront, with representation from local anglers, Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters, Toronto Region Conservation Authority, Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources, Harbourfront Centre, Ontario Place, Toronto Port Authority, Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport, and other relevant stakeholders."
