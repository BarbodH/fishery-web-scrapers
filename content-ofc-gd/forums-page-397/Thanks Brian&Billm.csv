705120,davey buoy,2012-06-12 17:42:00,5505,"Just want to thank you guys for your help. Went to a park this afternoon and within 1/2hour had the line flowing through my hands.40' no problem at all.Wanna go 60' I think so.What a feeling not relying on the lure ,only the wf line.Another whole new beginning.Thanks again."
705132,Spiel,2012-06-12 18:05:00,9065,"Another world of possibilities are now your`s Dave, run with it."
705134,davey buoy,2012-06-12 18:07:00,5505," I think your right,thanks."
705137,misfish,2012-06-12 18:12:00,29133,"Ok,now go down to lovers creek,and do those 40ft casts.  We,ll be out soon enough Dave."
705142,davey buoy,2012-06-12 18:19:00,5505," We will too. just like a kid in a candy store,to have 12' or more out and than pull another 20' or more off,and gone on your second follow through,wild,what a feeling."
705146,capt bruce,2012-06-12 18:25:00,820," Good on ya , Its not as hard as it looks (or as some guys will tell ya) . Used to give lessons in the parking lot at work , turned on many to this kind of fishing , get out there , cause now you get to land a fish without the help of a winch (reel) it gets even better .. Nice to cast 60' but most fishing you will be better off with 40' laying the fly down right in the seam ... Once you gone to flys you will never go back ... Remember tho the first fly is free soon the gear adds up lol ..."
705147,BillM,2012-06-12 18:27:00,17367,"Like Bruce said, you'll rarely be making long 40ft casts..  Once you get out on the river gotta practice laying them down nice and soft and in the right spots"
705148,davey buoy,2012-06-12 18:33:00,5505," I can see down the road that happening,but your right ,not near as difficult as it is sometimes told.You have to remember that the fly is weightless,and it's the line your casting.Once I figured that out away we go. I'm thinking,waders and a lot of real estate is somewhat needed,and not lovers creek.lol:rofl2:"
705151,davey buoy,2012-06-12 18:35:00,5505, Hopefully as well as I did float fishing.
705200,misfish,2012-06-12 21:52:00,29133," Oh come on now,you just have to learn not to cross over other anglers lines.  Looking forward to our fall fish Dave. Yer a good fella. Is the pool ready yet? We can do steaks and ceasar salad(on me) and practice casting."
705213,davey buoy,2012-06-12 22:26:00,5505, Pool won't be ready till end of the month.That's one heck of a offer for the eats. Hopefully we get out in the boat real soon.
705240,BillM,2012-06-13 00:07:00,17367,"Casting in the pool?  Lots of hatches still going on boys, get out there!"
705259,Christopheraaron,2012-06-13 01:10:00,3525,"Cast in the pool in the winter, fish in the summer."
705335,misfish,2012-06-13 10:34:00,29133,"After some steak and beers,the pool will be the safe place.LOL"
705465,davey buoy,2012-06-13 18:49:00,5505,"Friday off,I heard the hatch is still on.Lots of flies to give it a try.Water should be somewhat lower,A little wading,a little fly and a little let's see what happens.LOL."
705547,misfish,2012-06-13 21:53:00,29133," That,s the hardest part of all. Once you get going,and make the land,you know it ain,t right,you have to bring it back and try again. It,s a pisser,but ya got to make it right. Dave,what ya doing Saturday and Sunday. Lets flick some flies."
