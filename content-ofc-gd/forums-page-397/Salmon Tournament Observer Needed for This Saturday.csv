Every boat needs an observer and it is a great chance to spend a day on Lake Ontario and learn from the Pros. I have a friend coming a long way who needs an observer. There is a mandatory meeting on the friday night and then 8 hours of fishing on the Saturday.  please send a pm or email me at [emailÂ protected] Thanks"
