705546,Skipper D,2012-06-13 21:50:00,1970,"Heres a little communications history on a system that always worked no matter where you lived .  Dose any one remember the benefits you received back when by going into town once a month , no .... well thats when you picked up every thing you needed to get by with for another month , you got to see friends and relatives you had'nt seen for a long time , which generally lead to a large get together before heading back home , by meeting together you got to hear all the latest news that every one had to share plus plan some things for the future . If there was a story told by some one who had spoke with a person from the cariabean it would have stole the day . You don't belive me , maybe thats because we all have to much ringing going on in our ears today . The people who once did live like this have only been gone now for just a bit more then twenty years , one being my grandfather who passed away in 1996 , he would never understand this thread  ........ LOL ."
705320,Stoty,2012-06-13 04:19:00,2910,Corporate might be...but their consumer support is JUNK
705323,BillM,2012-06-13 04:55:00,17367, You just need to know the right people to talk to..
705327,Stoty,2012-06-13 05:32:00,2910,"Assumed when you call ""customer service"" they are the right people. Apparently not with Bell, LOL. Made the move to Rogers quite a few years ago, and SO glad I did. Bell is/was nothing but a headache to deal with."
705333,blue pickeral,2012-06-13 09:45:00,267,The CRTC rules need to be changed to allow foreign competition. Wind Mobile got nothing but a hassle and plenty of whining from Bell and Rogers when they bought up available cell frequency space - parent company was off shore. The president of Wind challenged Rogers and Bell to go international - quit hiding behind government skirts. Neither would last two minutes. Canada has the highest rates in the world.
705341,Fisherman,2012-06-13 11:18:00,7201," Put away the string and tin can phone you have and buy a Nokia, I just traveled from Barrie to Spanish, never lost signal anywhere in between and beyond."
705344,jigsnreels,2012-06-13 11:34:00,133,I may be one of the last people on Earth who does not own a cellphone.  Life is good.
705376,Fish4Eyes,2012-06-13 13:08:00,1022,"Not looking to stir the pot, but your tone was pretty nasty to a poor woman who has done nothing but try to assist you as best as she can. I have come to learn that being firm but polite goes a long way in this day in age. Don't be fooled, if you were the Bell CEO, your call centre would be in the Carribean too"
705382,Roy,2012-06-13 13:36:00,13728, Make that TWO.
705385,Ralph Field,2012-06-13 13:47:00,1018,I do not like Bell's Consumer Help line either. Perhaps they have to locate off shore because they can not find Canadians willing to work at the call center. We have to import workers in the agriculture industry to harvest crops because Canadians would rather collect welfare or a disability pension than work at a job that they feel is not good enough for them.
705386,woodenboater,2012-06-13 13:47:00,2277,Have Bell corporate and their coverage is spotty out of big centres. Wolseley Bay: bupkiss but guy with Rogers was iPhoning photos of his fish from out near Rainy Island. New Liskeard: bupkiss as well with that emergency only message.  They're flip sides of the same coin imo and not worth the switch unless they throw in some major incentive.
705388,Billy Bob,2012-06-13 13:54:00,5865, If a living wage was offered for these jobs then they would be lining up in the streets to acquire one.
705390,Raf,2012-06-13 13:59:00,3495," Yup, it's a dead zone no matter which provider you are with (I've had service from the big 3 over the years and it makes no difference) If the sun & moon & stars are aligned you can get a signal if you're at the top of a hill, esp around rainy island for some reason.  There was supposed to be a tower going up near Dokis but the bean counters (I presume) decided the people up there are not worth the investment."
705391,BillM,2012-06-13 14:05:00,17367," So you didn't leave the highway?  Wow man, who are you trying to impress, lol!"
705393,bdox,2012-06-13 14:12:00,329,"What are you guys talking about with regards to Rogers not having service? I have a iPhone 4 and drive from Hamilton to Sault Ste. Marie twice a year, and the only time I don't have a signal is at the very bottom of a couple very deep valleys. I'd be interested to see what kind of phones people are using who are complaining about no service outside cities..."
705394,BillM,2012-06-13 14:18:00,17367, .....it's when you get off the beaten path that you'll notice a difference.  Has zero to do with your handset.  One of the advantages of CDMA over GSM.
705395,Raf,2012-06-13 14:18:00,3495," Service along major arteries is rarely an issue as there are cell towers along them, it's when you step off the beaten path  fyi, I have a Samsung Galaxy SII.  a little better than tin can and string."
705397,shane,2012-06-13 14:20:00,652,  Make that three.  And I thought I was the only one.
705405,DRIFTER_016,2012-06-13 15:00:00,10439,  Rogers does not work at all in the NWT. When I moved up here I had Rogers (for 14 years) and had to give it up because it just didn't work period up here (no towers). When I called to cancel my contract and told them where I moved to they said no problem and didn't even charge for cancelling. I found Rogers very good otherwise I would not have been with them as long as I was.  Bell Mobility is dealing with a class action law suit up in the North here for charging us their 911 acess fee when there is no 911 service in the NWT or Nunavut. When it is over and done with I expect that Bell will lose and they are going to have to reimburse anyone who has/has had a cell phone north of the 60th parallel.
705412,Headhunter,2012-06-13 15:54:00,5703,"Well, I have one, but given that it only requires a charge up twice a year, I simply don't use it much... Life is much easier when you are not available all the time. HH  ps... I called Bell to set up a business line here at the house as I have started working from home... they wanted: -$140.00 to run a separate line to the house -they wanted another $140.00 to put a jack in the room -they wanted $67.00per month for the line  So, in total, over $350, not including tax and I haven't made a phone call yet. They said that was the cost. I called Rogers... $40.00/month, no intallation fees. Got a call from Bell a few weeks later... told them to stuff it!"
705416,Steve,2012-06-13 16:03:00,2075,"what would the north shore of huron be considered?  cause I was using my google maps ap on my rogers wireless to find logging roads that lead to the north shore of huron.  about as ""off"" the beaten path as you can find up there....  Although Bdox and I both use Rogers, my blackberry was picking up better signals than the iPhone.  Finally - if your more ""off"" the beaten path than I have described above - what the heck do you want your phone to work for?  Remember when we camped with no phones?"
705429,BillM,2012-06-13 16:59:00,17367,North shore of Huron is really close to Hwy17 where all the towers are..  See if your phone works in say.... Chapleau!  I only wish TBayTel would let Bell customers piggy back on their network.
705431,Raf,2012-06-13 17:09:00,3495,I am more than happy to be out of cellphone range when camping.. means I can't get work emails/calls  The question was asked however  here is rogers' coverage map (bell will be similar they sometimes even share towers) you can see that along the major arteries there's good coverage and you can see where the gaps exist.  http://rogers.wirelessdealer.ca/coverage/index.asp?l=en
705437,DRIFTER_016,2012-06-13 17:41:00,10439,"  You do realize that cell phones do have an off button right? Having 100% coverage would be great in emergencies and to get away from it all while camping hit the power button, problem solved."
705507,bdox,2012-06-13 20:08:00,329, Bell doesn't sell CDMA handsets any more
705526,fishermccann,2012-06-13 20:44:00,655,"They all have a GPS in them , we know where you are!!!"
705165,Pikeslayer,2012-06-12 19:44:00,1443,"This is an actual 'cut & paste' from the Bell Customer Service 'On Line Chat' service.  Thank you for your patience an online representative will be with you shortly. Your wait time is approximately 0 minute(s). Welcome to bell.ca! You are chatting with Trista. To assist you, may I please have your name and mobile phone number with area code?  you: I would like a phone number to a Bell office located in Canada. NOT THE CARIBEAN!!  Trista: Hello and welcome to Bell Mobility's chat service. How can I help you today?  Trista: Sorry, I sent that at the same time I received your message.  Trista: What type of Bell office are you looking for?  you: I want to transfer my business phone & business internet from my company to another. I have made 3 request for a ""Transfer of Responsibility Form"" since last Thursday. Your colleagues in the Caribbean cannot deliver.  Trista: I am sorry to hear that you are having trouble with the transfer of responsibility requests. The calls for customer care are routed through the same IVR. That being said, my suggesting to get to a Canadian representative would be to select french as your language. Once you get a representative on the line they will likely be bilingual and be able to assist you right away. If by a rare chance they only speak french, they can connect you to a bilingual representative in that centre.  Trista: Selecting French ensures that you get through to a Canadian centre that can handle both english and french requests.  you: Really? Is this the only way to speak to a representitive in Canada. That is absolutely rediculous.  Trista: Yes, I apologize but the IVR cannot specify where each call gets routed. I can see if there is a corporate number for you to contact, They generally only handle corporate account types but if your account is categorized as a business and not under an actual person's name then they can complete requests for you as well.  you: No thank you. It will be much easier to just cancel my 2 accounts and switch to Rogers.  Trista: I am sorry that you are not getting the assistance you require from speaking to representatives in other countries. If there was a Canadian specific number available, I would be more than happy to provide it to you.  you: Thanks again. I am printing out this conversation and posting it on my Business to Business internet forum. We are doing an exercise in customer service and I think this will be ideal for forum study and conversation.  Trista: I understand. Sorry again that I wasn't able to provide a better resolution for you.  Trista: Did you have any other questions for me today?  you: Sorry. I am on the phone with Rogers. I'll get back to you. Please hold.   Trista: I'm sorry but I am not able to wait on the chat any longer.  you: No need to be sorry. Rogers is going to look after the administration in closing my Bell accounts and setting us up with their services.  Trista: I am sorry to hear that you are moving carriers, but I do understand why.  Trista: Enjoy the rest of your day.  you: I will. As I no longer need to deal with Bell  Your chat representative has ended the chat session. We thank you for using this service and we hope to have answered all your questions.  "

705176,Lip-ripper,2012-06-12 20:16:00,228,"Alot of places I go to hunt or fish don't have Rogers cell coverage. Bell phones will work perfectly but rogers phones will have a large print ""EMERGENCY CALLS ONLY"" message that appears on the phone and not allow incoming or outgoing personal calls.  For that reason, I can't switch..."
705178,crappieperchhunter,2012-06-12 20:22:00,2582,I have horror stories from both Bell and Rodgers. Neither have an edge IMHO. However we have switched back and forth twice between the 2. Each time getting a better deal then before. We are paying WAY less then we where 7 YEARS ago and have a FAR better package.  Play the game and keep some money in your pocket for a change
705180,Billy Bob,2012-06-12 20:24:00,5865,Someone tried to tap into my wife's credit card today....they tried to charge $1 to her card so to verify it for more fraud charges......so the the bank notified  us via email and shut down the card......had to call bank for a new credit card......we got a non English speaking women......had to keep asking her to repeat what she said.....finally wife ask for a English speaking person......we were put on hold for at least 5 minutes.....finally hung up and redialed.....got thru right away with a English speaking person.

705241,SirCranksalot,2012-06-13 00:14:00,3291,"When the Bell guy asked why I was was switching I said ""price and service---that just about covers it"". I still have a Bell cell but nothing else. I could tell a few stories----don't get me stahted!!"
705250,Fisherman,2012-06-13 00:53:00,7201,"Well let me tell you about the marvellous Bell Service on the peninsula between Meaford and Owen Sound, there is none, so you can blow Bell in your granola."
705254,adempsey,2012-06-13 00:59:00,1498,"I've had bad experiences with both.  Going to Rogers will only make you happy for a short while, but I bet it felt good =)  I left Bell as soon as I had to use the phone in the store to get service.  Still can't get over that.   I don't think they're the only company that does that either."
705263,35Wailin,2012-06-13 01:21:00,59,"  I had a Bell cell for one contract.  Switched to Rogers, never looked back.  I cancelled Bell landline and went to local cable carrier for phone, internet and TV.  Local has sometimes spotty service/ cust. service, but on the whole better than Bell.  My sister, who has NEVER been a Bell customer, went straight to the same carrier as I have now, as soon as she left the nest, keeps getting calls from Bell to RETURN to Bell.  Hello!  Never been with them, check your records..."
705266,BillM,2012-06-13 01:30:00,17367,"Would be nice if Rogers actually had coverage in the sticks.  Great for the city, but get a few miles out of Barrie and ZERO service."

Bell is almost useless, although their customer service people are much more knowledgeable, friendly and courteous about the things that can't be done than they have been in the past"
705317,Stoty,2012-06-13 03:45:00,2910,Bell DOESNT have customer service! End of story.
705318,DRIFTER_016,2012-06-13 04:05:00,10439,Actually Bell Mobility's corporate division's customer service is quite good. I talk to their people in Calgary or Edmonton depending on what I'm calling about.
