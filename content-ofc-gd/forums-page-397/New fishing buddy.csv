705298,SRT8 smoker craft,2012-06-13 02:47:00,1107,So a fellow OFCer's dog had some puppies and I popped in for a unrelated visit and the little buggers were so cute and kept tuggin at the old heart strings so I talked the boss into it and picked up our new puppy Rebel (named after my Lund Rebel XL) yesterday he is the calmest puppy I have ever had and can't wait to get him out on the boat . Thanks Ryan for the new addition to our family    BTW he still has some more pups ready to go this weekend

705307,Squid,2012-06-13 03:03:00,1656,Awwwwwwww
705325,GreenCanada,2012-06-13 05:01:00,375,"My old friend Shadow (black lab) was my first dog and definitely man's best friend. He is missed, but Sir Charles Darwin aka Charlie (my chocolate lab) has been an excellent companion. Labs have amazing personalities and are perfect for exploring the outdoors.  Welcome to the forum Rebel!"

705346,Christopheraaron,2012-06-13 11:39:00,3525,Black labs and beagles I think are the best species. Cute little guy!
705350,Jacob,2012-06-13 11:46:00,186,What a great looking puppy.
705355,Fish4Eyes,2012-06-13 12:12:00,1022,Very cute pup! I have a 16 month old black lab myself. Unbelievably smart and loyal breed. Feel free to PM me if you need tips or advise.
705361,NAW,2012-06-13 12:30:00,4022,Nice lookin dog for sure.  Do you hunt?
705371,Spanky80,2012-06-13 12:57:00,152,He is a cutie!!
705377,Joey,2012-06-13 13:25:00,9122,He's just adorable.  Congrats on your new puppy.  I'm sure Rebel will be a great fishing dog
705379,Jer,2012-06-13 13:30:00,1426,"Beautiful pup. I hope you have some water nearby for swimming.  We have a 2 year-old. Even though her mother was a golden, she looks more lab than anything else. I have to say she has been one of the most well-behaved dog I've ever known."
705380,SRT8 smoker craft,2012-06-13 13:32:00,1107, No I don't hunt but I do have a 3.5 Year old that talks about hunting all the time (his Papa hunts) so I may end up hunting soon enough LOL  I have a life preserver with the handle on the back already that will fit him in no time and I am going to get him one of these when he is full grown so he doesnt scratch up the boat he's named after   http://www.sears.com/paws-aboard-gc1300-camo-life-vest-small/p-SPM1622142401P?prdNo=1&blockNo=1&blockType=G1#cpc_availability

705384,lew,2012-06-13 13:47:00,12766,What a great looking pup !!  You'll have a bud there for alot of years.
705409,fishnsled,2012-06-13 15:34:00,3520,Quite amazing how fast they grow. I had a difficult time saying no when I was down there the weekend they were born. Even more adorable now and would never be able to walk away from them. They better be gone to great homes before the Fish-A-Thon. LOL! Congrats on the new fishing partner.
705410,Fish4Eyes,2012-06-13 15:37:00,1022," It's not the dog, its the owner in alot of cases."
