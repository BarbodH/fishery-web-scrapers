Political correctness on a fishing board!! guys give your heads a shake, we want to debate this in public!! Let the public read the comments and then start discussing it with their friends etc.. Have folks come on here and challenge us that is what is needed here not censorship!! People need to get pissed off no matter what the culture or nationality."
