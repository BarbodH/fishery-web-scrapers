705441,Rich Clemens,2012-06-13 17:53:00,3131," Let's see .... a).  I doubt Lew would ever put such a fish in his boat. .  Depending on when Paul/Joey arrive, they may be too late. c).  Same for Dan. d).  My odds are getting better and better .....  The more I think about it, I may just run over around Chris K's place on my way up and pick it up."
705448,John,2012-06-13 18:03:00,2956," If in doubt Rich there is a 40+ incher in pike bay, or at least there was 5 years ago when we released it."
703930,Rich Clemens,2012-06-08 16:48:00,3131," Uh ...  Lew.   Can Patsy and I each have one if we promise to release them unharmed ? Yeah.  Hopefully next year we'll be back up to full strength again.  But, there will be less competition for the pike derby this year."
703943,lew,2012-06-08 17:36:00,12766," OK Rich, but only 1 each, I've made arrangements for all the others"
703970,Joey,2012-06-08 19:25:00,9122, Well I hope I'm included in those arrangements
703974,lew,2012-06-08 19:29:00,12766,"OK Joey, I spose you can have 1 too, just don't tell Paul or he's gonna want in on the action too"
703975,John,2012-06-08 19:35:00,2956,She's prolly going to have to promise that there will be no errant muskie lure hooks attached to her body this year Lew..
703978,lew,2012-06-08 19:41:00,12766,As long as it's not MY body John
703993,misfish,2012-06-08 20:58:00,29133,"DON,T FORGET THE NET J.OR IS THAT,USE, A NET"
703996,John,2012-06-08 21:06:00,2956,"OH nice, I guess will never live that one down......"
704001,Rich Clemens,2012-06-08 21:14:00,3131, Oh yeah.   Where is that spot again ????
704056,Joey,2012-06-09 00:08:00,9122," Oh, thanks for the reminder John  Still got the scar to remind me"
704075,danbouck,2012-06-09 01:16:00,4380,"I'm confirmed for cottage #3 Saturday night, Probably arrive early afternoon I'll miss the pike tourney and I will be boatless but at least I'll have one night up there this year"
704089,Joey,2012-06-09 02:30:00,9122," Well with only 3 couples and no TJ's secret batter or deep frier, not sure there will be a pike tourney Dan!"
704101,motv8tr,2012-06-09 03:43:00,2587,"glad you're going to make it up Dan, my hope is to go up for a few hours on Sat. I'm looking forward to visiting with those that are going to be there, and who knows maybe I'll wet a line while I'm there  Maureen"
704119,lew,2012-06-09 08:03:00,12766, I'll be heading out for a musky on Sunday morning Dan and will be fishing alone so your more than welcome to join me if you want.
704203,danbouck,2012-06-09 16:31:00,4380,"Thanks Lew, I can't turn that offer down!"
704209,Rich Clemens,2012-06-09 16:51:00,3131,Assuming there are any left after we get done with them Saturday
704211,lew,2012-06-09 17:08:00,12766," Excellent Dan, looking forward to it"
705209,motv8tr,2012-06-12 22:16:00,2587,Unfortunately it looks like I'll have to change my plans from coming up Sat to coming up either Monday or Tuesday..with luck I'll even wet a line   Looking forward to a great visit...  Maureen
705223,pikeguy,2012-06-12 23:00:00,195,"Sorry to say but Shorty has to work and this is the first time i heard of it was not sure if it was gonna happen. I did not even open my boat yet this is very sad. Maybe i can open the boat this weekend and well i have to test it out lol, Dont tell Shorty. Will be in Verner on Sunday maybe i will stop by and say hi"
705224,Joey,2012-06-12 23:06:00,9122," Would be nice to see you again, hope you can make it"
705225,lew,2012-06-12 23:16:00,12766,Hope you can make it down for a visit Guy
705421,Squid,2012-06-13 16:17:00,1656,There will be plenty of room on the dock for the 2012 OFC G2G group photo at Lakair this year.
705426,Rich Clemens,2012-06-13 16:49:00,3131, And a better chance the trophy could make it's way across the border.
705432,Squid,2012-06-13 17:19:00,1656,LOL
705439,John,2012-06-13 17:48:00,2956,Personally I think that the person(s) that has traveled the furthest should automatically get the trophy for 2012! Whaddya say Rich?
697964,lew,2012-05-20 12:16:00,12766," Sorry Roy, I think I misunderstood you."
697966,capt_hooked,2012-05-20 12:21:00,212,"It's all about timing...!  There's good timing and bad timing...  like fishing... sometimes the fish bite, sometimes they don't...  So, Leslie and I will really miss not seeing many of you this year...  But maybe a few of the old OFNers will drop by, out the the blue, just to surprise  Richard and Patsy....?  Perhaps a few board members will show up who have not been here before?.. now that we have some extra space to accommodate everyone.. Actually we have lots of space available it seems....   Ha!  For those of you who never made it up before this will be something like the 10th year?  (help me out here Roy?, TJ?..)  where a few OFNers have gather togetter to practice the fine art of telling fish stories about fish-tailing and to meet other OFC board members.  Usually it is someone on the board who organizes the whole thing and Leslie and I just run around making sure everyone is doing O.K. and fitting water leaks and counting worms.  Anyway I do not like to self promote on this site..  so do your research...  All this babbling is to say thanks to all for all the past times that various folk have made it up there for the annual G2G. We have always enjoyed the company of the OFNers.  Many fond memories.  Here's wishing all the OFC board members a great summer of fishing.     the cap't."
698525,LeXXington,2012-05-22 14:22:00,1928,"I will be up there early, June 1st weekend  if anyone is up there,  Unfortunately, work/life takes over and I might not be able to make it that weekend..  If work get's Postponed I will be there"
698722,lew,2012-05-22 23:23:00,12766,"Well, we've had a change in plans and my wife and I have decided to go up for a week in June and will be there June 16-23 and we'll be in cabin W-1 right by the boat ramp.  It just wouldn't seem like June if I didn't spend time at Lakair"
698731,Rich Clemens,2012-05-22 23:42:00,3131,
698740,lew,2012-05-23 00:00:00,12766, Looking forward to spending time with you & Patsy again Rich.  See you guys in a couple weeks.
702546,danbouck,2012-06-04 01:03:00,4380,Well it looks like I'll be passing by that way on the 16th so I may just stop in and spend the night.
702551,Christopheraaron,2012-06-04 01:10:00,3525,"Can't do either date, but I'm sure we can do something else."
703766,Joey,2012-06-07 23:27:00,9122,"Well looks like we've had a change of plans aswell Lew.  Paul, Ralphie and I will be joining you, Diane, Rich and Patsy, arriving the 16th and staying til Tues or Wednesday  See you up there"
703769,lew,2012-06-07 23:36:00,12766,"Great news Joey, be good to see you guys again as always.  And Marvin says he's lookin forward to meeting Ralphie"
703771,Rich Clemens,2012-06-07 23:45:00,3131,Lookin' forward to another great time.    Just one more week to wait.   Boat's ready
703781,Joey,2012-06-08 00:17:00,9122," Yep, Ralphie loves dogs and will take to Marvin as soon as he sees him    Can't wait myself, looking forward to seeing all of you.  We'll be in cabin 10, so we'll have the firepit to sit around at night if ya'll want"
703785,Rich Clemens,2012-06-08 01:01:00,3131,I want.   I want.     We're in number 9 this year.    Have they lifted the fire ban yet in that area ?
703791,Roy,2012-06-08 01:26:00,13728,Fire ban has been lifted so you're good to go. Have the best time everyone.
703792,Nipfisher,2012-06-08 01:29:00,2449,"Said it last year and never made it but I will try to make the drive for a visit, maybe camp out for the night.  Randy, Rod Caster, are either of you guys interested in going for one night? I have a tent and all necessary gear."
703799,Rod Caster,2012-06-08 01:52:00,5784,I was hoping to make an appearance this year but looks like I'm going to be working striaght through the next month or so.  I would have liked to meet some of the lakair gang.. Maybe next year.  Thanks for the tent offer blair... Youve always been a great host/facilitator!
703845,Skipper D,2012-06-08 10:50:00,1970,"If you can't make it to Lake Air and If any one wants to meet me ,  stop in here ..... lol ."
703859,capt_hooked,2012-06-08 12:31:00,212,"Fishing is good so far this year.   Good numbers of walleye, pike and the lots of incidental catches of bass and musky already.  Water levels are high.  Shadflies just began to hatch last couple of days.  Not many mosquitoes yet.  Lots of firewood...!  "
703900,John,2012-06-08 15:18:00,2956,You guy's are killin' me. First one we will miss in 8 years! Dang weddings they should be banned!
703903,lew,2012-06-08 15:22:00,12766, We've got an extra room if you & Barb  can make it up for a couple days thru the week John.
703910,John,2012-06-08 15:52:00,2956, Thanks for the kind offer Lew. Will check my work schedule that week...
703911,Rich Clemens,2012-06-08 15:52:00,3131," Yup, Patsy and I will miss you guys and the morning ""Breakfast at the Lodge"".   We'll have some bacon and eggs for ya.   Hopefully things will work out next year.   Hope you're both doing well."
703912,John,2012-06-08 15:56:00,2956,Thanks Rich....
703915,Spiel,2012-06-08 16:00:00,9065,"First one I'll miss in 13 years (I think?).  I'm not happy about it, but there's not much I can do about it short of winning the lottery.  I will definitely miss the pleasure of being in the company of all you fine folks."
703916,lew,2012-06-08 16:04:00,12766," Too bad your not gonna be there Chris, infact it's a shame what's happening with our G2G this year.  Gonna be strange with only a few of us up there this year when we've had so many others in years past.  Oh well, all the more muskies for me"
697737,SlowPoke,2012-05-19 02:28:00,2984,I haven't been around much lately but I don't see any chatter about the Lakair G2G
697766,misfish,2012-05-19 10:44:00,29133,"It,s a no go, for us this year Brian."
697769,Rich Clemens,2012-05-19 11:12:00,3131,Patsy and I will be arriving on Friday  (The 15th I believe). We'll be in Cabin 9 this year. Staying the entire following week in hopes on putting another Lakair beauty in the boat. Gonna be tough beating our banner musky fishing last year.  (Well ... for us anyway). Looking forward to seeing everyone and hopefully some new members will join us. Aleady have a little goody bag of stuff for the prize table.
697772,livinisfishin,2012-05-19 12:38:00,661,When is the g2g?
697775,lew,2012-05-19 12:51:00,12766,"I'll probably be passing on the g2g this year, but a few of us are going up for a couple weeks in August."
697781,Rich Clemens,2012-05-19 13:17:00,3131,Saturday June 16.  Pike derby and fish fry.  Some folks come earlier and/or stay later.  Lots of great fun.  Meet other OFC'rs.  Share only truthfully stories. (most of the time  .... Ha ha).  All around good time.   Check in with Kevin/Leslie to reserve a cabin or camping spot.
697807,motv8tr,2012-05-19 14:56:00,2587,"I'll be on vacation the week before and after, and plan to do a few day trips to that area.  This year I'm not able to stay as I don't have anyone available to look after the zoo here.  I wouldn't mind if someone could spare a spot in their boat for me on the Friday, for Sat I don't know what my plans are, I may rent a boat and bring my best friend and her two boys for the day.  It's been too long since I've been around the board and fishing, hoping to change both in the near future and looking forward to getting back in touch with everyone.   Just looked at my schedule, discovered I messed up, I'm off for the two weeks following, not the week of....might have to do some fancy foot work to get the Friday off....Dang!!! Maureen"
697826,ChrisK,2012-05-19 18:57:00,2772,I can't make it up this year due to other commitments here in London. Problem is I have the pike derby trophy here at the house. Is anyone passing by near London on the way up to Lakair or departing from London ?
697828,Christopheraaron,2012-05-19 19:07:00,3525,"Hey, might be able to come, where is the lake?"
697829,Spiel,2012-05-19 19:12:00,9065," I'm also quite unlikely to be making it this year as much as it pains me, haven't missed one yet but it's not looking good for me this year."
697830,Christopheraaron,2012-05-19 19:16:00,3525,Google maps says nipissing is that the right one?
697831,danbouck,2012-05-19 19:23:00,4380,"I won't be making it up, I'm still hungover from last year!"
697835,Joey,2012-05-19 20:04:00,9122,Not sure if we'll be making it this year either
697836,woodenboater,2012-05-19 20:06:00,2277, here ya go RHF    Would like to have gone up for my first G2G but may not be able to swing the time. It'd be the perfect place to pick up tips and hear some extremely tall tales
697838,lew,2012-05-19 20:46:00,12766,"I hate to admit it, but it almost seems like our annual trip may be petering out."
697861,John,2012-05-19 23:10:00,2956,Going to be a miss for us too this year....
697870,Rich Clemens,2012-05-19 23:24:00,3131,Well this ain't lookin' good do far.   Gonna be awful lonely.
697872,Christopheraaron,2012-05-19 23:26:00,3525,"Don't worry, I'll keep you company!"
697897,aplumma,2012-05-20 00:30:00,6896,Looking bad for Daplumma and myself this year. We might make a later trip up North but it is more of a concept than a plan right now.   Art
697903,BITEME,2012-05-20 01:07:00,1968,Yeah looks more like a for sure no go for me this year to much going on and no way to squeeze it in may be we should try to squeeze something off at pigeon this year I know it's not the same heck I'm even Game for simcoe  Just a thought Peter
697948,lew,2012-05-20 09:58:00,12766, I'm in for that Pete.
697952,Roy,2012-05-20 10:56:00,13728,"I'm in, between the 21st of July and the 12th of August."
697953,lew,2012-05-20 10:59:00,12766,"Good stuff Roy, we're there August 4-18"
697955,Christopheraaron,2012-05-20 11:04:00,3525,"In where? Pigeon or lakair? I may not be able to swing those dates though, it's really close to my yearly ns trip."
697958,motv8tr,2012-05-20 11:34:00,2587,"well it looks like if I want to see/meet anyone I'm in for a lot of day trips this year....hope you guys are available on weekdays, cause weekends are out for me...  Maureen"
