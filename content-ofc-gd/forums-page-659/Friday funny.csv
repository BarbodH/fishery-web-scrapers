Marine walked the entire length looking for a seat, but the only seat left was taken by a well dressed, middle-aged, French woman's poodle...  The war-weary Marine asked, 'Ma'am, may I have that seat?'  The French woman just sniffed and said to no one in particular 'Americans are so rude. My little Fifi is using that seat.'  The Marine walked the entire train again, but the only seat left was under that dog. 'Please, ma'am. May I sit down? I'm very tired.  She snorted, 'Not only are you Americans rude, you are also arrogant!'  This time the Marine didn't say a word; he just picked up the little dog, threw it out of the train window, and sat down.  The woman shrieked, 'Someone must defend my honour! This American should be put in his place!'  An English gentleman sitting nearby spoke up,  ""Sir, you Americans often seem to have a penchant for doing the wrong thing. You hold the fork in the wrong hand. You drive your cars on the wrong side of the road. And now, sir, you seem to have thrown the wrong one out of the window"".God bless the US Marines!"

Back in 1966, Charles DeGaulle announced that France was withdrawing from NATO and that the U.S. had to close all bases in France and remove all military personal from French soil. Lyndon Johnson was president and Dean Rusk was secretary of state, the supposed response from Rusk was "" Does that include the 60,000 American servicemen buried on French soil ?"" classic  edit: BTW DeGaulle did not reply"
