I spoke to a coworker that used to work for Honda and that all of the transmission issues have been fixed in the line and that it's a reliable van.  I've read the reviews on it, and like every other car out there, some love it, some don't.  Just wondering if anyone has had any experience with it.  Thanks  Dave"
