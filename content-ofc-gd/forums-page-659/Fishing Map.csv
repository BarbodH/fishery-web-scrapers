I was thinking if I could get a map of the lake it would be a great help for us. If anybody has a map they can send me please let me know.  Thanks so much."

They have free maps of some lakes - you might find Three Mile.  I just drove by Three Mile Lake Road yesterday on my way back from vacation!"

Adventure Maps has one of Three Mile Lake.  They are pretty decent fishing maps, just need to send them a cheque or money order."
