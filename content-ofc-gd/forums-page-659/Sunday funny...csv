There was only one little thing bothering me...It was her beautiful younger sister.  My prospective sister-in-law was twenty-two, wore very tight miniskirts, and generally was bra-less. She would regularly bend down when she was near me, and I always got more than a nice view. It had to be deliberate. Because she never did it when she was near anyone else.  One day her 'little' sister called and asked me to come over to check the wedding invitations. She was alone when I arrived, and she whispered to me that she had feelings and desires for me that she couldn't overcome. She told me that she wanted me just once before I got married and committed my life to her sister.  Well, I was in total shock, and couldn't say a word. She said, 'I'm going upstairs to my bedroom, and if you want one last wild fling, just come up and get me.' I was stunned and frozen in shock as I watched her go up the stairs.  I stood there for a moment, then turned and made a beeline straight to the front door. I opened the door, and headed straight towards my car. Lord... and behold, my entire future family was standing outside, all clapping!  With tears in his eyes, my father-in-law hugged me and said, 'We are very happy that you have passed our little test. We couldn't ask for a better man for our daughter. Welcome to the family.'  And the moral of this story is:        Always keep your condoms in your car."

484468,irishfield,2010-07-11 23:20:00,26272,Na... my sis-in-law is still teasing me 30 years later Roy!  I WAS gone Dan.. managed 10 days and got 2 out of 3 ice broken docks repaired before the latest family .... up.  Exact same day.. same time.. a year later. July 8th @ 5pm. Last year the cops called me and told me my sister was dead.. this year it was my brother's doctor calling him to tell him is aviation medical was officially suspended and he is already admitted and having an Angiogram/plast in the morning in Mississauga. Thank God he's a airline pilot with a mandatory medical every 6 months or the outcome would be similar to last year!
