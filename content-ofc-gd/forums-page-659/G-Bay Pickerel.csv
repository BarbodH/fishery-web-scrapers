My regular fishing partner Steve had to work, so I called up one of my SAR unit teammates, who was more then happy to fill the position.  Woke up at 4 am, on the water around 5:30.  (should have been 5:00, but there was a long wait at Tim’s for some reason, then we watched Barrie PD arrest a drunk guy, and break up a college house party..)  I trolled an Erie Derie for about 2 hours with a few bites, but no takers.  We where in anywhere from 6’ to 25’, and trolling about 3km/h.  I switched to a slow death rig, slowed down to about 1.5km/h, in 8’ to 12 FOW.  5 minutes later and there's a Pickerel in the boat!  In the next two hours, I boated 3 more.  What a great day!!  The first was 15.75”; next two where both around 20”, and the last about 19”.  One under the slot for the dinner table!!  Here's a pic of a smallie from last weekend.  Sorry about the poor quality pics, they where all taken on my cell phone.. "
