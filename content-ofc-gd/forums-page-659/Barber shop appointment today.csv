483369,Joey,2010-07-08 02:15:00,9122," Ya, and even tho his hair was as long as mine, I paid 3 times as much.  Figure that one out!!!"
483372,JohnF,2010-07-08 02:36:00,3494," Nope, but I remember her. I actually had hair when she was here.  JF"
483375,splashhopper,2010-07-08 03:06:00,2931, I think every young guy in Perth county got  hair cut from Jikky at one point
483414,TennesseeGuy,2010-07-08 12:23:00,957,"I bought a really good haircut Tuesday.  Total cost including the 25% increase in price plus 20% tip was $12 USD.  No VAT yet, but it's in the works.  JohnnyBass, did you really mean it when you wrote you were putting me in my place?  I'm not sure what that means, but it's probably not a compliment."
483421,oxcowboy,2010-07-08 13:04:00,544,"i havent paid for a haircut in at least 15 years, i bought a set of wahl clippers and use a small mirror and do it my self, i also cut a bunch of guys hair in college for a 6pack of beer, worked out real well for me.  jason"
483429,TennesseeGuy,2010-07-08 13:36:00,957,"Hi Jason,  Many of my Morehead friends don't frequent barbershops."
483455,Billy Bob,2010-07-08 15:27:00,5865," Barbershops........BARBERSHOPS......you still have some of them.......I have to go to the ""Hair Salon""..."
483469,OhioFisherman,2010-07-08 16:28:00,6623,"LMAO, Connie at your age be glad you still have hair to cut! Don`t worry! be happy! Never worried to much about mine, an old hippie, it`s hair! I don`t care! don`t like it? then kiss my hairy ass.  LOL if your hair is too short you might become a redneck!"
483475,TennesseeGuy,2010-07-08 16:57:00,957,"Hey Paul, being born in a farmhouse near Camden, Ohio makes me a redneck at birth.  Wasn't a matter of ""becoming a redneck""."
483699,OhioFisherman,2010-07-09 12:30:00,6623,"""being born in a farmhouse near Camden, Ohio makes me a redneck at birth"" LOL Connie, they didn`t have hospitals back then? My kids asked me one time when they were you "" dad what kind of calculator did you use in school""? I held up two hands, and told them writing on them stone tablets with a hammer and chisel was rough! but it was easier, we didn`t use as many numbers.  I cut my own hair for 20 years, waiting on barbers or a ""hair stylist"" la de da just wasn`t in the plans. Plus a truck driver looking a little rough kept some of the er, morons at a distance.  LOL Johnny, not so much the taxes? It`s what they do with them? It seems like every politician out there has his own favorite idea for a new tax, and complains loudly about his cohorts ideas for their new tax."
483707,JohnF,2010-07-09 12:42:00,3494," That's politics in a nutshell. I don't get it how anyone with a brain in their head continues to buy into the hypocrisy politicians shovel our way. The idea of that otherwise intelligent folks blindly defend everything any one party stands for is stunning, and I don't care if it's GOP & Dems or Liberals & Conservatives up here in Canada. The only constant in politics is that politicians will always end up making liars of themselves. The only way to keep up is by waffling. If you wanna espouse a principle long term then be prepared to change party loyalties a few times.  JF"
483711,Dara,2010-07-09 12:54:00,3052,  I think we go to the same place and handle it the same way
483712,Guest gbfisher,2010-07-09 12:56:00,0,It's no wonder they don't add an Eco 'fee' to dispose of your hair. I mean with all the hair sprays added or color makes it hazardous waste...
483713,Fish Farmer,2010-07-09 12:58:00,2234,"Your getting away cheap, cost me $50.00 or more. I take my barber out for supper. Of coarse it's my wife. I hope she don't read this post. I could be minus a few ears next haircut."
483717,JohnF,2010-07-09 13:06:00,3494, Quit yer griping. At least yer barber goes home to bed with you.  JF
483721,Spiel,2010-07-09 13:16:00,9065,   No comment.......  
483724,pikehunter,2010-07-09 13:27:00,1659,I thought only women had to make an appointment with hair dressers? So what's with making an appointment for a haircut?
483890,Tybo,2010-07-09 21:10:00,1373,Great! Now what. You GUYS going to talk about shampoo and what styles you have.
483929,Billy Bob,2010-07-09 22:56:00,5865," I like Pert Plus shampoo the best because it includes a conditioner. For best results you should wet, lather, rinse and repeat by a big hooter blonde."
484044,solopaddler,2010-07-10 11:17:00,8605, Me too and for the exact same reason.
482873,TennesseeGuy,2010-07-06 14:16:00,957,"Price of my haircut is up 25% beginning July 1, 2010.  I'm pleased with the service and will tip 20%.  Is that going to be okay with everybody?  This thread does not deserve a second post."

482878,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-07-06 14:42:00,0," Hey its your money.  While your at it? You can even tip the gas station clerk for his service, tip the home heating meter readers for their service and you can tip everyone else that you please for their service."
482883,ketchenany,2010-07-06 15:15:00,3229,Tell him to take 25% less off and th price will be the same.
482887,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-07-06 15:21:00,0, Maybe they should make a law that forces you to tip(pay tax) all service. Maybe that will make you even happier.
482890,Gerritt,2010-07-06 15:50:00,6129,I honestly think you guys have taken this a bit too far..
482897,Tarzan's Jane,2010-07-06 16:20:00,1183," The Barber or the customer????  It's just a most frustrating time for some of us.  It bothers me when I don't tip and yet it hurts my pocket book when I do.  A dollar here, two there, it all adds up and has become tricky in balancing that ever decreasing little pocket pook....again, for some of us."
482901,ketchenany,2010-07-06 16:25:00,3229,"  My ""barber"" drives Mercedes! And goes to Florida two times a year.  A dollar here and there . . ."

Americans who cry like babies at paying how much tax? 6%? And how it is unconstitutional to force people to pay taxes at all?lol  Great post. We're all happy you would pay a 20% increase at the barber, and at the gas pump and everywhere else. Who gives a crap what you would pay?  Too bad, I wrote a nice little reply, but it got erased when I pressed send."
483349,Fishnwire,2010-07-08 01:35:00,983,That baby dos and don'ts was one of the funniest things I've seen in a while>  I'm still laughing.
