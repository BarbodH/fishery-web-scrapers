The rain was really coming down at dawn so I had to wait it out for a bit before I could venture out of my vehicle.  Once the rain slowed, I threw on the waders and started crawling around the shoreline in search of largemouth.  Casting a rat through the lilly pads brought up nothing.  The weeds had really grown quickly with our early summer so I reached for my trusty floating Rapala, which I could work slowly over top of the weeds and through the weed troughs.  Bang!  This ol' girl hits.  She measured 17-inches and just about swallowed my lure, but it was easy to remove the hooks and send her on her way.  After dodging more rain and emptying my tackle vest, I couldn't coax another bass to come out and play.  Sure beats working though!"
