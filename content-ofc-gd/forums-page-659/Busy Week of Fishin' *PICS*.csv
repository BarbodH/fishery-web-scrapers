It was a tough bite, but I found a good sized pod of decent fish, I just never found me a kicker.  Ended up in 4th place, all fish caught on a flippin jig from 1-12 feet, no real pattern.    Monday and Tuesday I was laying stone in the ridiculous heat, brutal!  Wednesday, I had a client out on Lake Muskoka.  He was up from Florida to watch his son play soccer (for the Dutch Lions FC) and wanted to fly fish for some smallies.  I've never guided a fly guy before, but I obliged, it was intriguing.  He was a very interesting guy.  He is a broadway producer, and he's produced some pretty big shows... Lion King, Shout, and the original Chicago on broadway.  He also produces music tours for the likes of Bon Jovi and Bruce Springsteen.  He did pretty well, landed about 15 smalljaws on a tough day with the extreme heat, and lost more, all on popping bugs. Thursday I had him out on Simcoe for some smallies.  They weren't having any of the fly gear, but we managed to land about a dozen smallies in the 2-3 pound range throwing tubes in 12-14 feet of water.  No pics from Simcoe.      This morning, I had a group meet me at 6am to fish Couchiching.  We started up shallow and got into a bunch of 1.5 - 2.5 pound fish throwing stick baits and topwaters.  Later in the day we went to check a deep weed line I'd found last year.  They were there again!  They managed about 6 or 7 GOOD fish off the weedline throwing Chigger Craws. They kept a few 1-2 pounders for the BBQ and 1 bigger one that swallowed the hook, the rest were released.     At 2pm when I dropped them off, I met my next group, a father/son from Brazil.  We went to target smallies on Cooch as the wind on Simcoe had got up to bad for them. They managed about 8 bass over the 4 hours and probably 30 perch throwing crankbaits in 7-10 feet of water over sand/weed transitions.  Nothing real big, but decent fish nonetheless.  The father lost about a 4.5 pounder when it jumped and spit the hooks.  Everything else was in the 1.5-2.5 pound range. Only 1 largie, the rest were smallies.     Taking tomorrow off and a busy week ahead of me.  Hope to report again a week from now. Thanks for reading"

Still looking to catch my first jig and pig fish.  Lost 5 so far, but seen 2 of the 5 and they were pickerel! On jig and pigs in 15 FOW. I guess the jig was too big or they were taking the trailer. Throw out the grub and wham. Pickerel in the boat.  Good luck on your next tournament. Look forward to your report."
484413,Leecher,2010-07-11 19:16:00,7832,Good going Steve    seems like every client had a happy outing     Good on you
484415,Cudz,2010-07-11 19:27:00,2652,Hey Steve That was me who passed you in the narrows on Thursday aft.  I think you had a client.  I was leaving couch.  I caught a few smallies but no real size but the perch were insane and would not leave my crankbaits alone. Nice job on the bass.  Looks like you have been busy with the charters.  Good work!
484436,steverowbotham,2010-07-11 21:10:00,1800," Yeah man, it was a tough bite that day and you're right about the perch.  We must have caught 30 or 40 on our tubes! That was the fly fishing client."
