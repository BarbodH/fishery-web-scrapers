483698,Fish Farmer,2010-07-09 12:28:00,2234,"Finally got the boat out of the garage to do some lake O fishing myself. Out yesterday off 50 Pt. I got into the Rainbows that you wouldn't believe, I lost count, 20 anyway and lost I don't know how many. Quite a few fish in the 10 to 12 LB. range Got there as soon as the park opened. Headed out to 90 FTW. I tried to set 2 riggers but it was almost imposable, for 2 hours the rods were going off big time. I was beat in that heat  , setting lines, netting fish,trying to set again. I only got a few pictures taking them myself is a chore. My poor camera got slimed all over. All fish were released except 2 I couldn't revive. Man what a day with that heat, I didn't want to get off the lake with fishing like that. Stayed out from 7 am to 3:30 pm. I only had a 1 hour dead time. I hope this weather doesn't screw up the fishing for Monday, taking a few guys out. I hope it won't be, You should have been here yesterday days     "

483749,Fish Farmer,2010-07-09 14:28:00,2234,"I just used spoons NK28 candy corn did the damage. I did take out the doctors and flies but never put them on. I like fishing light if possible. Spoons worked, that's what I stayed with.  Would like to but I have many buds that want to take them out. Some times I just like going by myself because I like Dark to Dark days. A lot call me crazy, but I just get so into it, I forget all about time.  Thanks guys. Get out there the fishing is fantastic right now."
