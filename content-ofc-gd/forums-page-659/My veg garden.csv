484226,kickingfrog,2010-07-11 01:36:00,8333,"This our first year for a vegitble garden. Wanted small and simple 10ft by 4 ft. We'll see how this year goes and then see deside wether or not to expand next year.  Tomatoes:Better boy, early girl and cherry Zucchini Green beens Pepers: green, yellow and red Cucumber  My wife had some beens today and we'll have two of the zucinnies tomorrow. The zucchini plant is the one taking over the garden on the left.       Zucchini   I think garlic is going to go in next year for sure, and maybe some carrots."
484227,alexcba,2010-07-11 01:39:00,634,nice! wise to start small then expand. i'll take a few zuchinni fresh from the grill.
484229,fishing n autograph,2010-07-11 01:41:00,2540,good job! i wish i had a back yard and time for a garden
484257,Roy,2010-07-11 04:25:00,13728,"Rob, get rid of the zuchs! They'll uproot your fence then eat your house if you leave it unguarded for a long weekend."
484263,alexcba,2010-07-11 07:51:00,634,lol roy!
484269,laszlo,2010-07-11 10:15:00,487,"Looking forward to eating my fresh tomato salad topped with garlic, salt, black pepper, balsamic, olive oil, bocconcini and basil. YUM!"
484272,Beans,2010-07-11 11:12:00,3339, Do as Roy sez...or you will find yourself sneaking around the neighborhood late at night leaving zucchini on every doorstep...
484278,bigugli,2010-07-11 11:41:00,6138,"With a small garden, skip roots like taters and carrots.Take up a lot of space and require more care with weeding. Besides they are dirt cheap. Use the space for fresh herbs, spring peas. Once kids get bigger, they get a kick out of growing their own pumpkins."
484291,kickingfrog,2010-07-11 12:41:00,8333," That's exactly why we didn't plant any this year, same with beets. If we expand it though, I would like some carrots. Herbs for sure next year."
484353,tb4me,2010-07-11 16:33:00,3295,Rob keep in mind if you want to do the garlic for next year they go in the ground this fall..I like to plant mine mid september. Good luck and love your garden!! Doesnt hurt to cover the area that the garlic is with straw for the winter months. In the spring leave the straw on the ground. it makes a great mulch and is awesome to keep the weeds down!
484367,misfish,2010-07-11 17:05:00,29133,Rob nice little garden you got there.Chives would be a nice addition.
484376,dave524,2010-07-11 17:27:00,4508, Keep chives in a clay pot and don't let them go to seed. They can get invasive if you put them in the ground and let them self sow.
484377,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-07-11 17:32:00,0,Its a start! You should be proud of yourself. As you grow older you start to appreciate the fruits(or vegetables) of your labours more....
484390,misfish,2010-07-11 18:04:00,29133, Never had to do that Dave.Proper maintenance helps.They also regrew every year. The clay pot is a good idea though.
484396,fishing n autograph,2010-07-11 18:20:00,2540,any probs with rabbits?
484401,Leecher,2010-07-11 18:44:00,7832,"Nice garden Rob    For your first I say great job bud.... I remember mine a couple of decades ago, was 20' x 30'.... I had planted all kinds of different seeds and plants.... had some success in 80% of what I had planted, this was my first learning curve.  As the years went by, I soon realize what grew well and what not... so all this to say that I basically stuck to tomatoes, cucumbers, beans, carrots, garlic and peppers  A good soil mix is key to being successful, that is why, every year, I add pre mix garden soil, sheep manure and peat moss to all of my little raised beds.  Bone meal is a must when planting.  Again great job and thanks for sharing Jacques"
484404,dave524,2010-07-11 18:53:00,4508," They like to lounge on the cool ground in the shade, never much of a problem, few nibbles on the beet tops now and then.  "
484405,kickingfrog,2010-07-11 18:54:00,8333,"Thanks guys.  No problems with rabbits at this point, although I see them all the time walking the dog. I wonder if the dog's scent has something to do with it?  Maybe the bunnies know something about my vegetables that I don't."
484407,mbosh1980,2010-07-11 19:05:00,349, No Joke.  My grandparents used to try to offload zucchs on my parents pretty much every summer sunday when I was a kid.  Still think they are gross!
484445,bigugli,2010-07-11 22:15:00,6138,Breaded and deep fried with some tzatziki sauce will change your mind.
