483826,JohnF,2010-07-09 18:01:00,3494,"I mentioned a while back that my wife had taken a header in the river and she wasn't impressed that I completely missed her dilemma, so engrossed was I in my fishing. She must have told my 93 year old mom (Gabby we call her) and mom put her poetry writing skills to work and created this card. It arrived today with two Fox40 whistles.  "
483827,alexcba,2010-07-09 18:03:00,634,hahahhaha thats awesome. your mother is quite the character
483829,ctranter,2010-07-09 18:05:00,543,"Haha that was great John, reminds me of my Grandpa"
483830,mbosh1980,2010-07-09 18:05:00,349,That is great!
483832,ccmtcanada,2010-07-09 18:09:00,7971,Classic...just classic!
483835,JohnF,2010-07-09 18:13:00,3494," That she is. She doesn't let the 93 years hold her back much, at least not in the head department. The body's a different thing so she spends a lot of time in her chair at home. She went through a little bout with breast cancer a few years ago and she made us promise not to tell anyone about it until after she was back home. She didn't want folks fussing over her. Of course it's a different story if she hears someone else is having a tough time. She's right into the kitchen baking cookies (she makes the world's best shortbread) and filling casserole dishes to tide them over till life gets normal again.  We're pretty damned proud of her.  JF"
483836,JohnF,2010-07-09 18:17:00,3494,Dunno if I've ever posted this but it's Gabby and our son Matt on her birthday at our place.    JF
483837,alexcba,2010-07-09 18:19:00,634,wow she looks great for her age! and that smile you can tell she's a comedian lol.
483853,Big Cliff,2010-07-09 19:35:00,6899,Beautiful! She looks like quite a lady!
483856,JohnF,2010-07-09 19:45:00,3494," She really is a lady, in the truest sense of the word. Would that I could get thru life with the same balance of dignity and humour. And she's one of the kindest, most considerate people you'll ever meet. Dunno how she kept her sense of style surrounded by us but she did.  JF"
483857,Jen,2010-07-09 19:46:00,833,"Anyone who can write like that and makes ""the worlds best shortbread"" must be an amazing woman.  You are lucky to have her in your life... how thoughtful the whistles were!  ( can I have her shortbread recipe?)  Thanks for sharing John...  Cheers,  Jen"
483863,Joey,2010-07-09 19:57:00,9122,"That's great John, really cool of her to do that.  She sounds like an awesome lady.  Now we know where you get your class from  Joey"
483865,JohnF,2010-07-09 20:02:00,3494, She tells everybody I'm adopted.  JF
483868,Twocoda,2010-07-09 20:05:00,4130,Look out Halmark!!!  Its things like this that play the heart strings with grace  It is always best to see the light side of things...Thanks for taking your wife fishing so she could stimulate your moms mind to pull my heart strings...  If i were you ...i would wear the whistles with pride EVERY time i ever went fishing again ...
483870,fishnsled,2010-07-09 20:07:00,3520,That's great!!:thumbsup_anim: Your Mom certainly is a very special lady. Not sure if she makes the worlds best shortbread but I'll take a batch of them and let you know.
483872,splashhopper,2010-07-09 20:09:00,2931,that's pretty kewl of your mom..  But somehow I think she is paying you back with those whistles when you brought up the topic of one of those medi alert ropes to put around her neck
483881,JohnF,2010-07-09 20:36:00,3494, You might be right. I think she was less excited about the emergency necklace idea than I was.  JF
483954,Leecher,2010-07-09 23:55:00,7832,Now that's a great mom
