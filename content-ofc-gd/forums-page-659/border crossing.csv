484018,Letpikego,2010-07-10 04:43:00,29,How many Walleye fillets can I bring back into the US from Ontario with a sporting lisence?  Does the four in possesion per day mean I can only bring fillets from four fish?
484049,Rich Clemens,2010-07-10 11:29:00,3131,"If your possession limit is 4 - then ya better only have 4 in your possession at any time - in the boat, in the freezer - they all count.  I brought a bunch of crappie back home a couple years ago.  Make sure the fish can be counted and quickly identified.   As I was removing the skin from the fillets, I ran the knife under the skin for just about the entire length of the fillet, but left that last inch still attached.  Laid the skin back over and froze them that way.  I filleted each one, placed the two fillets in a clear zip-lock bag, with some water, and froze them.  One or two fish per bag, dependin gon their size.  They were laid in flat and not stacked on on top of another.  They could be clearly identified and counted if I was asked to do so.  This also made it easier to pack in the cooler for the ride home and didn't take up a lot of space.  When it was time for some fish, I just removed the number of bags I needed, thawed a bit, and made the final cut to remove the skin from the fillet.  Yup - They was good."
