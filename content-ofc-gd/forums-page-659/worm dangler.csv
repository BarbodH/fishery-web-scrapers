First i'll tell you what i've been up to. some good and some bad. back in the beginning of april i was looking at buying a house(posted a report, thanks johnf for guidance). all went through and i bought it. im about 20-25min west of sault ste. marie living at prince lake. i bought a 1000sqft home at the lake with an acre of property. it doesnt need to much fixing up but being a carpenter i have to get my hands dirty doing some renovating which is going a bit slow and working on it as much as i can. which takes up alot of fishing time and also met an amazing girl which also takes up lots of fishing time. im pretty much 4km back in the bush out of cell service and from any source out decent internet(pretty much only dial yuck) which why you havent seen me around much. there is 30 full time residents and 27non full time resdients on the lake but it quite quiet and you don't hear to much but have come into contact with quite a few critters so far. i've seen lots of partridge on the road, porripines, raccoons, rabbits, foxes, a few black bears running through my yard, also seen a deer(a doe) in my backyard 2 weeks ago and also had a large bull moose run out in front of me last saturday night on my road. The lake is pretty slow and to be honest i've been there since april and have not really fished it. i've casted from shore and got a few smallies and my girlfriends little brother caught a small speck. The lake is known to have smallies and speck catches are rare but are known to be residents in the lake. Mid june i rolled my dakota down a ravine on my road and it caught fire and it pretty much burnt to nothing as you can see. my buddy and i walked away without a scratch but it hurt watching your truck burn from a distance. i bought a 2000 chevy s10 extended cab 4x4 and so far has been a great little truck. With everything going on i have not had anytime at all to fish! i've been out 4 times since ice out.once for pike. once for lakers as i watched my buddy catch all of them having a personal skunking. i went and fished the goulais river catching a 10lb musky(my first) im waiting on pics from my buddy. and i've caught some small bass in my lake. well that pretty much wraps it up for now! i hope you enjoyed my little reporting in and i'll be on every once in a while but not to often. have a great and safe summer everyone!!

As for me, things have been pretty good, getting out on a pretty consistent basis, one of the trips being the Goulais Lake fly-in trip, all's I can say is WOW!"
