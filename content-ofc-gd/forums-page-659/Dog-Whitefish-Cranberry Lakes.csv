483248,ctranter,2010-07-07 20:41:00,543,"I have fished Big Whitefish a few times.  Its still pretty undeveloped for a muskoka lake, so I found the bite to be pretty good.  I caught a few meaty smallies there last fall."

Went last year and had a fun time - but unless you mean big fish as in 2 lber, I didn't see any of those mythical creatures.  Hopefully this year will encounter a few.  Charles"
