482517,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-07-05 14:24:00,0,"Having missed the opener of bass due to work obligations, this weekend I was chomping at the bit to do some bassing.  By 8 am Saturday morning I was unloading the canoe and gear on the side of the small trail... after a short 15 minute carry we were on the lake.  Fishing in the morning started off very slow but as the day progressed it just got better and better. During the course of the day we caught about 50 SMB with a few pike mixed in for good measure.  Great day in the canoe and a great opener to the bass season.  The nicest 20 fish ranged were all over 3 lbs with a few nicer ones, with most averaging between 1.5-2 lbs.  Looking forward to 'eyes and atlantics in the coming weeks.  Here's a few pics we took!         "

482527,Grimace,2010-07-05 14:38:00,2020,Nice report.  Great shirt.
482528,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-07-05 14:39:00,0, Around 9pm the lake was coated in hex's.  Given the layer of carcasses on the shorelines here I think I missed the big hatch last week.  Boat #2 was very rough.  They showed up to the camp sans any food and several hours late due to Winger having to watch the soccer game.  Thankfully Jake and I had enough ravioli to cook up because the two of them would have starved otherwise.
