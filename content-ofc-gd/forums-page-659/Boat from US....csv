484537,skankbutta,2010-07-12 02:16:00,32,"I bought a boat from the US. I paid for all of my taxes, got the trailer inspected... Everything is good to go, however I have not had the boat ownership transferred over at a service Canada centre and have not officially picked up plates for my trailer yet (I am going to do it first thing in the morning). Right now there is a Michigan plate on the trailer.  2 Questions:  Can I transfer the plates from my old boat/trailer on to the new boat/trailer?  Also, can I take the boat out without going to a service canada centre and getting my canadian numbers?  I am hoping to take my son out tomorrow morning and don't want to ruin our day.  Thanks a lot for your help."

484540,irishfield,2010-07-12 02:23:00,26272,Yes to the plates..  NO to the registration.. $300 fine if you can't produce a vessel licence. Shouldn't take more than 15 minutes at Service Canada if you have the right paperwork.
