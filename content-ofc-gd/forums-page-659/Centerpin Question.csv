484308,streamerstripper,2010-07-11 14:47:00,28,I was recently gifted a Silex Superba Centerpin - problem is I want to switch it to left hand retrieve.  I know you are not supposed to be able to switch them but I know there are those around these parts who know alot about pins...please let me know if you have any suggestions.
