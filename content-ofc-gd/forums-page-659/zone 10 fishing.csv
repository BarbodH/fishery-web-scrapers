We targeted bass and pike mostly but caught a few walleye as well. We couldn't find the walleye during the day. We fished 15 - 40 fow with no luck until the mosquitoes came out around 9:30-10:00pm and then the walleye would start bitting but the bug bite was to much to handle. So we stuck to bass and pike fishing. We caught about 80 fish in the 4 days we fished. Here are a few pics            A baby musky:      All fish were returned to their homes so I can catch them again in a couple weeks."
