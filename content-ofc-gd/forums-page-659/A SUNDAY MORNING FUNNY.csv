I entered the lot at pier 4 this morning,stopped and talked to a gent that was rigged up for salmon and trout fishing.We chatted for a second,cause he was in a hurry to get out there.I dont blame him at all. Well his boat was tied off and I was walking along side of him, giving him some info on what colour to try. Well he entered his boat stepping on his cooler.He then went for one nasty spill on deck.As much as I wanted laugh this morning,I couldnt,Been there and done it.Not fun at all. Had a little chuckle when I got home,over that and me swimming looking for keys at port hope marina last saturday. Sorry man,It was funny to watch!I hope hes ok.  "
