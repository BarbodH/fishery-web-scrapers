483697,mike hagan,2010-07-09 12:27:00,50,Spent a couple of days camping  on Cold lake off of Gold lake. Weather was unbearablly hot and fishing was hard . But managed to boat three 5 lbs. and a few smaller ones . Overall not a bad couple days of fishing.Want to go back when the weather is a more favrabitle time.Looks like this lake could pull out some monsters.
