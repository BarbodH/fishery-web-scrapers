849176,kickingfrog,2014-04-21 18:54:00,8333,"http://barrie.ctvnews.ca  A bear carcass has been found in Barrie near Anne Street and Vespra Street, just feet off the road. Police were called to the scene this morning, and say it looks like the bear wasnâ€™t tagged, and may have been poached illegally. The bear appears to have been in a freezer; there was freezer burn on its nose and paws. Barrie police now have the bear in their possession and expect the Ministry of Natural Resources to look at the bear to help decide whether they need to investigate further. As of now, the person who dumped the bear could only be facing a maximum fine of $5,000 for illegal dumping. A pilot project is allowing a spring black bear hunting season starting May 1 in Northern Ontario. The traditional black bear hunting season opens in August.

849346,lew,2014-04-22 14:59:00,12766,Unfortunate waste of meat. Makes you wonder about some people...  Also a waste of a beautiful animal.
849350,Twocoda,2014-04-22 15:07:00,4130,i wonder if the valuable organs were harvested
849352,misfish,2014-04-22 15:09:00,29133,THATS WHAT I WAS THINKING.
849386,irishfield,2014-04-22 17:34:00,26272,From what I saw on the news it was just a complete hide that had been gutted totally.
849399,Sinker,2014-04-22 18:27:00,8692,"Ok, so was it just a hide....as in just the fur?  Was it a gutted carcass?  Was it even shot?  Are there any actual logical facts?   Did anyone ever think it might have got hit by a car(maybe even a snow plow) and spent the winter in the snowbank??  Is this the first bear in barrie or something??  S."
849420,kickingfrog,2014-04-22 19:31:00,8333,It was partly in a plastic bag. From what I saw on the tv news the head and front paws were there ( I assume the rear paws were there but I didn't see them). It was a smallish looking bear. The hide had been cut with a sharp object.
849427,misfish,2014-04-22 19:55:00,29133,Pretty much looked like a year old cub.

849476,Gallie,2014-04-22 23:26:00,1215,"I couldnt agree more, regardless of what parts are strewn about its unfortunate to see the waste of any animal big or small"
849511,BillM,2014-04-23 00:30:00,17367,"Looks like just the hide, especially being in a plastic bag."
