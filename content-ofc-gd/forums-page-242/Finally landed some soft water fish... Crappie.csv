849181,mike rousseau,2014-04-21 19:12:00,4661,Finally was able to get some soft water fishing in today... Original plan was to take the little man but he had a change of heart so I dropped off the kids at grandmas and took to wife...  Literally first cast    We proceeded to get into crappies with a few OOS perch and bass mixed in...  Fun couple hours in the sun with no kids around...  Hot baits were the black/green Houdini fry and pink fin s shad
849184,JerMac,2014-04-21 19:31:00,37,Very nice fish! Way to go.
849191,dracokaos,2014-04-21 20:05:00,116,I was up at lake scugog today and its open. Has anyone been on for Crappie's? not looking for spots just curious if anyone has had any luck..
849192,Rich,2014-04-21 20:06:00,3927,What a colorful spot Lol  Nice job!
849197,mike rousseau,2014-04-21 20:15:00,4661,Lol  Yeah  Shore spots that hold fish are few and far between around here... And most are very noticeable to other locals...
849201,davey buoy,2014-04-21 20:40:00,5505,Nice going Mike! looks like fun!
849214,BillM,2014-04-21 22:51:00,17367,"Nice job Mike, got out to my local spot, back bays are still ice covered, lol!"
849218,mike rousseau,2014-04-21 22:55:00,4661,Some canals/creeks still have ice here...  The ones that don't are booming with life... Mink... Frogs... Turtles... Minnows... Birds...  Felt a little like summer...  Much needed feeling
849231,BillM,2014-04-21 23:40:00,17367,"Yeah, we ended up just going for an extended boat ride (while dodging iceburgs  )"

849313,Old Ironmaker,2014-04-22 10:21:00,8243,"Way to go Mike. stopped at a local creek that I always wanted to try for ice out crappie and tossed a microjig and a pencil float and caught a 12"" perch after 30 seconds, thought I snagged on something, what a surprise, almost summer like, exactly. Unfortunatly the only fish in that creek. Spent another 1\2 hour, nothing."
