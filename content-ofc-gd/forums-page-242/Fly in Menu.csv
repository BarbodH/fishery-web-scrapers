849692,sneak_e_pete,2014-04-23 22:39:00,540,Hey all.  Booked for a fly-in with my little guy (he is 6) for this summer.  Looking for some menu ideas from the seasoned fly-in guys.  With no running water...the less dishes the best!  Only allergy is nuts.  Thanks in advance!

849705,Moosebunk,2014-04-23 23:43:00,3970,"Hey Pete... couple things I often do for camping and even fly-ins...  Fajita Kit.  Chop, Ziploc and freeze your chicken at home.  A pepper, an onion... you're good.  Any leftover tortillas... breakfast burritos or sandwich wraps.  Pre-cook chowder, chili, chicken or beef stew.  Freeze in either Ziploc bags the portion you need for the pot, or in aluminum take-out containers that are easy to just throw on any camp stove.  Find with camping and wanting to have easy and hearty meals that are quick, all the prep you can do at home makes settling in to the end of your fishing day that much easier."
849788,aplumma,2014-04-24 11:36:00,6896,"Remember the fun foods as a kid like hotdogs on a stick , pop tarts warmed up as a breakfast or a dessert. The introduction to either sardines or vienna sausages on crackers as the best fishing lunch in the world. A good treat is also freeze dried ice cream just like the astronauts ate.   Art"

849823,sneak_e_pete,2014-04-24 14:08:00,540,Some great ideas!  I havent had a pop tart in ages...that is a definite!
849829,BillM,2014-04-24 14:31:00,17367,"Pete as someone who's deadly allergic to peanuts, make sure the trip is completely nut free.  Cross contamination is real issue when you've got only a few knives/forks.  Also some of the Mountain house freeze dried meals are pretty good!"

849834,chris.brock,2014-04-24 14:55:00,4053,"good point, with the remoteness extra cautions should be taken   the pre-cooked bacon isn't quite as good as the raw stuff, but it's light weight and quick to cook pitas and flat bread seem to stay fresh longer than bread  we bring paper plates and burn them after, less dishes"

849903,Fang,2014-04-24 21:40:00,1330,"I took my kids on fly ins when they were young. Plan a couple very simple meals to cook around the campfire  Roast hot dogs on a stick that he picks out of the forest. Make simple sandwiches for in the boat but wrap them in tin foil and pull in for a shore lunch. Make a small fire and heat the sandwich up over the coals  and you must take a bag of marshmallows and chocolate cookies with you to make smores  Stop by dollarama as they have cheap hot dog roasters, campfire grills and such to take with you  My kids remember these little things still today more than they fish they caught"
