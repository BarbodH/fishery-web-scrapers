849532,Maverick,2014-04-23 01:31:00,371,"I like that setup; looks like the skeleton of an old oil tank..?    Ya, he found the idea on the net. Basically the firebox is under the first pan and then there is a 2 inch air gap and 2 inches of sand ontop of a plate under the second pan. We had flames shooting 4 feet out of the stack. When it get's going it is freakin' hot. He is planning on lining the firebox with a ceramic insulating blanket of some sort to eliminate heat loss.  Thats a nifty set up Maverick...mount some wheels under it and your a mobile sap makin machine  Haha, that would be too funny."
849700,TJQ,2014-04-23 23:21:00,7806,Got our second batch in the bag.. 900+ litres of sap boiling down in a couple of days!   about 6 gallons of syrup. in the last one.  Still too much snow in the bush here to use the four wheelers..  but not enough to use the skidoo in a few places either... next collection is gonna be difficult.

849305,Maverick,2014-04-22 04:48:00,371,"Boiled 85 gallons off this weekend with my cousin down in Pembroke. We had always made syrup with our grandfather but he hasn't made it in about 10 years so my cousin made a boiler this winter and I must say it worked quite well. There are still a few kinks to work out but for year one, it was pretty good.  We didn't get started boiling until 4:30 so we boiled until midnight and fired up again the next morning. Not ideal but there was always a hockey game on so it worked out ok.  My cousins boiler contraption. Starting on the left is the warming pan, then the middle pan is hot sap and the right pan is the finishing pan. He would like to put a valve to drain the warming pan into the middle pan just to make it a little easier. On the finishing pan, 1"" is roughly 2 gallons.    Dogs were getting tired.    The next day and the dogs were still tired, hard work this syrup stuff.    Getting close...    All in all, no better way to spend the Easter weekend than with family boiling sap."

Great thread this is,I love it that there's people making syrup right from home.heck what else is there to do while the snow melts lol"
845901,Sinker,2014-04-05 23:18:00,8692,I have whats left of 140l boiling now....its down to about 50. should get 3 or 4 litres to bottle.  S.

846030,SmokestackLightnin,2014-04-06 18:03:00,390,"Started my first boil yesterday afternoon, around 250 litres of nice, clear sap.  I should be taking it off the main boiler around 3 into a large pot for the finishing boil.  I usually filter it when it comes out of the large evaporator, I get most of the sand but there is usually a little bit of sediment that sinks to the bottom of the jar."
846040,misfish,2014-04-06 19:00:00,29133,Sand? From tree sap? How does that happen?  I have been following this thread. Im thinking next year Im going to give it a go. Will a BBQ work for heat?Boiling down. I just want to say I made a bottle or two.
846045,lakerguy,2014-04-06 20:20:00,224,"Sugar sand accumulates as sap boils.  It’s a concentration of minerals and nutrients that collect as the excess water is boiled away.   It is perfectly harmless and can be consumed.  In fact, some maple syrup producers are unable to eliminate it completely even when using a filter press."
846046,Bill Shearer,2014-04-06 20:28:00,456,"If people only knew the un-natural things that are in the foods they eat every day, they would not be worried about the minerals that come from the trees. Those minerals are concentrated 40 times, from boiling, just like the sap. You know that 'little crunch' you sometimes get when eating a hot dog? It would scare you to know what it really could be! Some ground has more mineral than others. Most filters out."
846055,Sinker,2014-04-06 21:18:00,8692,"Shes runnin good today!!!  Brian, a bbq probably wouldnt do it. Each 5 gal bucket of sap should make a 500ml mason jar of syrup.  S."
846091,Rod Caster,2014-04-07 00:20:00,5784,"Still a slooow day, but it's picking up.  Question: Some of the buckets had 'sugar water' with a bit of a yellow tinge. It does have a slightly sweet flavor to it. Is this stuff still good? Any ideas what causes this?"
846130,SmokestackLightnin,2014-04-07 01:53:00,390,"It's likely due to it being in the tree for a while during a cold snap and it has been tinted.  I also find late season sap is tinted and it produces darker syrup.  It is still good but what I do is I will store it in a different container then the clear sap and then boil it later in the season.  I like the light syrup that comes with early sap.  My theory as to why it happens is I usually see it after going through a cold snap that lasts a few days and stops the sap flowing.  I think it's from sap that get stuck in the tree during the cold snap and when it start moving again it is tinted from the tree itself.  It might sound weird but it is only a theory, nothing has been proven.  And no sap was harmed when I thought up the theory."
846132,Sinker,2014-04-07 01:57:00,8692,"I collected 60l this evening. My best one day run yet. It was still flowing when I collected after dark. Im hoping it gets cold enough tonight to stop it and run again tomorrow, but judging by the forcast, im done for the season  S."
846195,TJQ,2014-04-07 14:20:00,7806,"Put in a few litres of sap on sat..its just starting... still 2-3 feet of snow in the bush, but the weather looks pretty good, looks like by the end of the week, il,  be busy."

Went this morning and collected 11 of the blue water jugs, almost half of my buckets were overflowing.  I believe those blue jugs are 20 litres each so all I can say is it""s a whole lotta sap."
846227,Sinker,2014-04-07 16:56:00,8692,"Yeah, I just collected over 300l from 40 taps at work. Same thing, buckets overflowing, and its still running in the bush here.

846231,Sinker,2014-04-07 17:07:00,8692,"Yep, weird season for sure.  I'll end up with about 12-13l finished. That's not bad for my little set up. Last year was a little too much for me. If I upgrade my boiler, I will tap 50 next year at home, but until my boiler is upgraded, I'm going to have to stick with my 25ish taps.  S."

Turned out real well this year, one of the best batches I have ever made.  As you can see from the picture we still have a lot of snow and you can also see that the river behind my house and not crested the banks.  Next boil will go on after this weather system goes through tonight and tomorrow.  I have to say, doing syrup is therapeutic for me.  Yesterday afternoon we sat out in the back yard, listened to all kinds of birds, heard the river flowing and listened to snow melting and the arrival of spring with a cold Coors Light and a few friends stopping in.

I just want enough to put some on snow like I did as a kid...the wife has never tried that, so it'll be fun!  So far I've collected about 15l from my 7 trees. Only one tap is filling the bucket, the others are much slower. I'm learning alot about the trees and forest maintenance; lots of plans for this summer!  I found out that if a tree has a massive curv/branch-off it doesn't make a good syrup tree."

I have over 100 trees on my 2 acres. I keep saying next year i'll invest in a better set up, but it never seems to happen. To be honest, my 25 taps is enough. I just enjoy the process, the time outdoors, and hangin out with friends and family. Its also a great excuse to tip a few back LOL  S."

You can't really do anything wrong. Colour will vary. Each of my batches have been different. I did 2 litres last night that were much lighter than the previous batches I did.

For our area this was an excellent year for sap and syrup producers are happy with their yields.  Hopefully supply and demand principles will adjust the high prices from last year in order to help consumers.

They still remember and talk about it.  very easy set up.  Take 2L clear pop bottles and a 4ft section of 1/2 PVC pipe Cut the pipe in 4"" length and then carefully drill a 1/2 hole into the pop bottle close to the top. Cut a thin notch in the pipe so the bottle has a notch to sit in. On the trees less than 18"" diameter I only put 1 hole and in my two bigger trees I put in 2.  drill 1""  into tree about waist to chest high. Push the pvc into hole and hang pop bottle. Check each day and empty into larger kettle. I'd empty and boil off every couple days and left it up my kids to check the bottles. They'd run home each day after school to see how much was collected."

It usually averages out to about a litre of syrup per tap, so if you only tapped 10 trees, you'd have enough syrup for the year, and then some. I have one litre left from last season, but I've been hanging onto it hard. Everyone wants some, but I don't make enough to be giving too many hand outs. I'm going to start storing mine in smaller containers so I can hand more out to friends etc. this year.  Its a fun thing to do at this time of year. Not much else going on when the ice is melting.

I poured them all out, re-heated it, and ran it thru the filter. Came out perfect. I won't try that again. Don't you get the crud in the bottles? I'm sure its harmless, but I couldn't give that to anyone!  Its ran real good here the last 2 days. 60l yesterday, and a new record of 100l today. Pretty good haul from 22 taps!  I've made 17 litres so far. I'm getting sick of it now! Taps come out tomorrow!  I read an arcticle saying that its been such a great run this year, that we could actually be doing harm to the trees. I guess we'll see once they start budding!  Definitly my best season ever. I've doubled my best harvest, but I've spent A lot of time at it this year.  S."

There always that crud in the bottom  .. like a black fuzz?? ... but you dont get it in the bottles when your drawing off the top a big batch that settled.  The crud I get on the bottom I mix with water and  put through a filter and put into the next batch...  which hopefully if things go as the weather network says we will be boiling a monster batch next weekend.  Its a season long thing.. lol.. and ya its like anything else when its done your happy but you can look back with a sense of real accomplishment.  I have people asking me every day if I want to sell some, and I tell them all they cannot afford to buy it from me.. you can get it at Costco for $15 a litre.  Its worth more to me as gifts for special people.  i have to say.. i think the best run is yet to come for us.. still a foot of snow in the bush and -10 tonight.  I am making some sortilege tonight with crown and doing a Shameless marathon.  lol"

Its been a long run. I hear ya on selling it, not happening here either.  I have to filter my small batches. Biggest batch I've finished yet is 4 litres.  Big plans for next year.

I melt it and make weights, put sinkers in my mouth etc......a galv pan can't be any worse,  no?  This is a maple syrup boiling pan. It even has a plate on the side that says maple something....can't read it, its been burnt off.  Looks like a great pan for $60......?  S."

775866,Twocoda,2013-03-27 12:56:00,4130,I cant say i have ever been a fan of maple syrup but yesterday i put in the time and did mt first boil...the end reault is two and 3/4s mason jars full....the hardest part of the process was to keep from sampling during the boil....i was targeting the viscosity of corn syrup but came up just shy of that....how do you experienced guys determine how thick it should be?
775893,Sinker,2013-03-27 15:00:00,8692,"I boil mine to 220 or so. Once it cools I check it with a hydrometer, and its pretty much bang on every time.  To get that much syrup, you should have started with about 60 liters of sap??  S."
775904,Twocoda,2013-03-27 16:41:00,4130,3 five gallon pails worth....i just kept adding to the turkey deepfryer until it was all used up.....tastes awesome but i think i did something wrong.....it looks dark golden on a spoon but not so much golden in the mason jars.....im going to try another 5 gallons today and try to hold the temperature steady at 219
775907,Sinker,2013-03-27 17:16:00,8692,"That sounds about right if you go by the 40:1 standard ratio. With my set up, I'm getting one 500ml mason jar for each 5 gal pail.  You can't really do anything wrong. Colour will vary. Each of my batches have been different. I did 2 litres last night that were much lighter than the previous batches I did.  It will go quicker if you preheat a pot full instead of adding cold sap to your already boiling pot.  S."
775908,TJQ,2013-03-27 17:20:00,7806,"Yup.. i go from a heater to a boiler to the finisher...  and ill be doing my first big collection this afternoon, and beginning to boil tomorrow for thew weekend."

776009,Twocoda,2013-03-28 02:25:00,4130,ok so the dark one i made from a 15 gallon batch that i continuously kept adding to the pot....the lighter one i made from a 5 gallon batch without adding any aditional sap as it was boiled....the difference in colour is quite different but the viscosity is the same and the taste is the same but i find the lighter jar to be more appealing to the eyes....so i think i learned a lesson in technique for my personal preference  I  think ill use the darker syrup as a glaze for smoked fish....but the light stuff ill probably chug and chase it with a few beers...lol
776010,TJQ,2013-03-28 02:32:00,7806,"Wow that is a difference in colour.. Ive been eating home made for alot of years and as far as im concerned, once you go black... Well you know.. Lol.. I love it thick and darker. Personally i think that the industry pushes that grade a light stuff cause after that.. Its all profit loss. If it sits and theres no sugar in the bottom.. Ya didnt boil it enough. But thats just me."

Waaaay back in 1953 or 54 I got to stay with grama and grandpa on their farm for a month in the early spring because the doctor thought I might be allergic to my sister.I know he was right but no one else did   .The smell of wood smoke and boiling sap on grandma's  FULLY chromed wood stove has left me permently scarred. I can remember it vividely  granpa saying Violet let the boy alone I am cold as I was feeding more wood into the firebox.Her response was Everton go get buckets of water for surely he will set the house on fire..The water was buckets of sap and I dont remember the whole process but after almost 60 years the smell and aroma is still there.  vance

773483,Old Ironmaker,2013-03-13 04:20:00,8243,"Ok TJ, first we will deal with the trade, I didn't say how big the bottle would be, can we spell Texas mickey?  Good try on a hint on the honey hole. All I can tell you it is one of 5 really big lakes, also referred to as an inland sea .But I swear to God on the lives of Mom and Dad the numbers are true. The weekend after taking possession in 96 I was sitting on the deck having a pop and a shot of Zoom Zoom with a buddy and heard a substantial splash, looked up and saw a good size wake. said must be a Tern diving for a meal. A few seconds latter another bigger splash inside the wake and it couldn't be anything but a fish. We looked at each other and both took off for the shed to get a rod that we just unpacked, must have been a sight to see 2 guys knocking each other about to get there first. First cast, silver and black floating Rap tied from last year and bang, the fish took off and peeled off 20 feet of line before I tightened the drag from zero. Set the hook and at that precise moment I went from a Walleye guy to a Smallmouth guy, go out twice a year for Pics now. Groundy threw out a plastic grub with the hook cut off and landed a 2 pouder one morning, before I got up. I told him next time he was getting citizens arrested!  What kills me most is waiting for opening. About 10 years ago some students from Mac biology came out and filmed them actually spawning. I say I'm going to film it every year and never have.. We now sit on the deck and watch them spawn all spring, dear wife calls it the aquarium. Gar is one of the most colour fish you have ever seen underwater, yet to hook one here, plenty in Florida not here, I am going to get 1 this spring if it kills me or die trying.  I don't know how many people want to know where the honey hole is, I always tell them bring me a check for a half million and they can own it, probably not.  My brother opened his big yap one year at the plant and I found 4 trucks in my laneway one day, they had stopped on their way back from the plant, hint #2. Luckily the Bass had moved out about 100 yards by opening that year.  Maybe I should start one of those old treasure hunts where you find the keys to a new car after they give hints in the newspaper everyday, they make sure you buy a paper the next day, haven't seen one of those for a long time.  I figured the crepe stove is where you made crepes but you were supposed to win me the argument by saying I was right, some brotherhood this fishing thing is!!!!!  Hope that Gibsons doesn't bang you on the noggin in the morning, isn't retirement swell?  I switched pages here and found a new background, like it. Easier to read but a bit bright which is good will help with battery life."

773098,Old Ironmaker,2013-03-11 05:37:00,8243,"Great stories folks. TJ sorry to hear about your Dad. The video wouldn't open on my Windows8RT pad.  The first year we bought our place we here before we moved in full time we came up on a weekend and found a note on the door from a local farmer. He asked if he could tap our trees for syrup, I thought syrup came from Maple Leaves! Sure go ahead. A few weeks later when we were up and there was note asking for us to stop by. Gave us a bottle of liquid gold. I dole out the stuff like it's 100 year old cognac. It's been 17 years now, what a treat.  He had an annual pancake breakfast at the farm where everyone could watch how the syrup is made, have a free plate of flapjacks and sample the syrup. Donations were accepted and all the money went to a local charity every year, all the money, he took nothing out for costs. The kids also were taken on a wagon ride pulled by his Belgian horses. This past year I was told the region told him he couldn't do it anymore as the kitchen in his sugar shack wasn't up to code. He wasn't selling anything. A few of us got so incensed we marched into the Mayors office and tore a strip off of his butt. Who ever thought they were protecting the public assumed that he was selling the meal. An apology followed shortly afterwards but we missed a season of flapjacks and syrup."
773100,Old Ironmaker,2013-03-11 06:05:00,8243,"TJ,  I showed the pics of the sugar shack to dear wife, she's an interior decorator. She told me to name your price for the crêpe stove. The one your daughter is standing next to. I told her that it was your grand mamas and I bet dollars to pancakes it not for sale. But if it is let me know. I'm no interior decorator but the best decoration I see in the ""sugar shack"" is the case of Canadian on the shelf!!!!!  All you guys keep up the good work, Sinker you are teaching the kids something they will never learn at Harvard, never."
773136,Sinker,2013-03-11 14:16:00,8692,"I would also assume the crepe stove is not for sale....and probably never will be.  About teaching the kids, your right, I agree 100%. That's exactly why I enjoy doing this. Not only that, but the kids LOVE it! They had no trouble sleeping last night  Nice to hear you put the boots to your mayor. That's a great story, and a part of history that should never be legislated! Good on ya!  S."

Ya.. no the stove cant be sold.. for a couple of reasons.. lol..  #1 its the only thing of my grandmas I have, #2 my buddy (Carl) who helped me move it, (Its pretty heavy .. lol) from my grandmas house and into that shack would skin me alive....  and lol.. up here.. no Canadian... no help...   Ya.. sleeping these days doesn't seem to be a problem.. lol  Raining here today and then everything freezes up for a few days on wed.

My other daily chores are getting neglected lol.  So, 7 litres of syrup, about 50lbs of propane, and lots of hours boiling. I hope it gets cold enough that I can get a bit of a break at this point. I know i don't ""have"" to do it, but I can't seem to stop. The kids now think I'm crazy lol  Maybe I am.......??  I'm gonna giver till it stops running though. I'm thinking a bottle of maple syrup will make nice xmas gifts and save me some coin down the road.

773347,wallyboss,2013-03-12 17:04:00,1095,"That crepe stove sure brings back some good memories. I remember him  towing a trailer behind a tractor to get one to our hunting camp that he built 47 years ago.  He had spent a good week and a half getting it all cleaned up, it had been stored in a barn for over 50 years. As we were crossing a small bridge that was over a creek full of black muck (typical of Northern Ontario bush) and one wheel of the trailer broke a plank and in the black muck goes the nice white stove. Took us like 4 hours to get it out of there. Then another day or so to clean it up again. But it was so worth it.  One of my best memories of that stove was to use an old fashion iron to make flat toasts right on the burner aftre cleaning them with newspaper along with slices of Kolbassa.  YUMMMY!!!   I still remember coming in from a full day of icefishing, taking my boots off and sitting in front of that stove with my feet resting on the opened oven door.  Oh what I wouldn't do to get in a Time Travel Machine and fly back to 1966!!"

773388,Old Ironmaker,2013-03-12 20:26:00,8243,"OK, a few things, Sinker you have far too much Maple syrup for 1 family. I am willing to make you a great trade, you send me a jar of syrup and I'll tell you where my secret honey hole is. How is this for a spot? 30 casts, 27 hits, 22 fish landed is my personal best. Groundy (fishing buddy, call him groundhog because when he and a groundhog stands on their hind legs they are about the same height) his record there is 30 casts 28 hits 27 fish landed, he would have had 28 for 30 but I made sure I tried my best to lip the last one for him but unfortunately he lost it.  TJ, you need to settle a difference of opinion between dear wife and myself. when I showed her the picture of the crepe stove (yes the one with your daughter standing next to) she was most impressed with the beautiful stove but she gave me that side ways look she often gives me after she asked why I called it a crepe stove. I told her that's what those stoves are called because that's what TJ called it and he should know it's his grandma's old stove and he should know because after all he has over 10,000 posts and he should know because he's an administrator here to boot. so please post a reply telling her I am correct then you can post again telling me the truth but I won't show her that one.  Now folks you all need to know I don't use acronyms or smily faces, I don't know what an acronym is, I thought LOL was short for someones initials and I don't know how to post a smily face without losing the whole text I typed. So if I don't come across right and sound like I'm being stupid I might just be trying to make a funny, or I'm just being stupid."
773392,lakerguy,2013-03-12 20:40:00,224,My son Joel has been busy the last couple days too. He's having a blast boiling sap down. I think the most fun he's having is driving the truck around the farm collecting.

That said, I'm not sure I can part with any just yet. I'm a bit of a hoarder. I make the stuff, and dole it out like its the finest whiskey money can buy lol  Let's see how much I get, then I will decide. What area of the world. Is this honey hole anyways?  I have about 3/4 of a 30l pot boiling now. I'm expecting right around 2 litres of syrup. Started at 10am, and put about 80-90 litres thru my boilers. Its getting a little quicker,  but still takes. A long time. Killed a few beers, and just started into a bottle of gibsons finest....added a shot of syrup to that too.....just because. My brother is on his way over for a feed of fresh cod we brought back from nfld, and caught ourselves, along with an appetizer. Of ""tongues and britches"" to get the appetite going.  I'd say that bottle of whiskey is going to take a beating  taking the kids perchin in the morning, right after french toast, made with home made bread,  and fresh maple syrup!

OK... first off.. its a really a ""Wood Burning Cook Stove""   WE call it the ""Crepe stove"" cause honestly niether my mom nor my dad, nor I could stomach fluffy pancakes.  We always ate crepes.  So when we eat up there the menu for dinner is always the same.... Crepes, Baked Beans and Honey Cooked Ham, with gobs of last years syrup.  (funny how I never get tired of it...)   So that why its the crepe stove... after we moved it in there. they are the only only thing that gets cooked on it... and they ARE delicious.  And my daughter thanks you for noticing.... you have no idea...   Honestly I don't sell any of my syrup... cause as ""gifts"" they will get you farther than any money ever could...  That bottle of Whiskey... never stood a chance Im sure..  look up ..  http://www.lcbo.com/lcbo-ear/lcbo/product/details.do?itemNumber=250134  Im gonna make me some of that stuff with crown..

772445,bigugli,2013-03-08 00:53:00,6138,"In order to have a good season, temperature is key. The warmer temps can be good and bad. It gers the sap flowing, but if the night temps stay above zero, the season shortens and the sap gets dark fast. Optimum conditions are for the night temps to drop below zero each night, interrupt sap flow, and delay budding."
772480,lakerguy,2013-03-08 03:02:00,224,"Same here Got barn chores done and went to collect and a few buckets were over flowing....not a bad night,2L tonight of nice ultra lite."
772565,SmokestackLightnin,2013-03-08 16:00:00,390,"This is my 8th year making syrup.  Just a hobby and fun thing to do with the kids and their friends.  I put out 45 buckets this year and so far collected approximately 180 - 200 litres of sap.  It started running Wednesday and we had a solid run yesterday, but today's run will likely match what I have collected so far.  I had a boiler made from stainless steel and it holds around 350 litres.  I use a 3-burner propane stove and go through 150 lbs of propane doing 3 boils a season.  Propane price works out to be around $100 or $15/gallon of syrup.  Although propane is not the most cost effective way of doing it I don't have to deal with prepping the wood nor tending a fire.  I start my boils at 3pm and they go all night.  By noon the next day I pour off what I have and do the finishing boil in a stainless steel pot the size of turkey fryer.  Last year was slow but where I am, this year has the makings of a long season with good syrup.  So far my best quality and quantity came in 2009 and 2010.  This winter resembled those for temps and snow load.  Good luck to everyone doing syrup this year.  Has anyone tried making birch syrup?"

We would have a few sips out of his pails on the way home from school   I was buddies with his grandson so I even made it out to the sugar shack a few times. He strictly used wood to boil down the sap.  Grandpa Watson is long gone and so is that Sugar bush. Right now it's a sub division...with not one of them Maple trees left standing

773091,bigugli,2013-03-11 04:00:00,6138,"One of the original ideas behind March break, at least in eastern Canada, was sugaring off. The whole family would be involved in the harvest with the fires running constant and non stop. Maple sugar was a traded commodity, and for many, the only supply of household sugar, being boiled down until granular and molded into loaves. All that remains of that process, today outside of aboriginal use, is the sugar candies that some places still make."
773096,Sinker,2013-03-11 05:25:00,8692,Just finished cleaning everything up. 3.5 litres finished. Great day. I'm beat!  That's 5 litres for me so far.  Another full day boil on tuesday.  S.
771829,Sinker,2013-03-05 00:30:00,8692,"Anyone here do this? What's your set up? Any secrets you want to share? I'm just doing this as a hobby....just something to do around the house. I have 32 buckets out, and just boil in a big pot on a propane burner. I'm kinda learning. As I go, but I'm enjoying my time in the woods, and my son seems to like helping out with the work, so its all good. Tried last year, but the run was a weird one, so it didn't pan out like I'd hoped. So far. This year, things are normal. Collected about 20 gallons of sap last week, and made about 2 litres of syrup so far. This week should be a good run if the forcast is right.  So, who's into this stuff? Anyone have a proper boiling pan they want to part with, or lend out? I will supply the sap and do the work of course  S."
771844,bigugli,2013-03-05 01:05:00,6138,"Used to run a small evaporator years back. Gave it to a friend some years back when the woodlot was bulldozed for a subdivision. 40 gallons sap boils down to 1 gallon syrup. We ran the evaporator over a wood fired brick pit. Took roughly 14 hours to get it thick enough, but it was a great all day activity. Start up the boil and drip, then go draw fresh sap, outdoor cookouts, taffy pulls. I like my syrup as a light amber grade. The later in the season you draw sap, the darker the syrup gets."
771850,Sinker,2013-03-05 01:35:00,8692,"Yes, I've been running a proper evaporator and finisher at work for a few years now, so doing it as a hobby at home is a lot longer process. Been boiling down 5 gallons at a time, takes me roughly 6 hours, and I'm getting one mason jar (500ml) each time. The first run sap is certainly the best. Almost looks like honey its so light. Planning a much bigger boil over the mmarch break. The kids will have a fun day of it anyways. This snow isn't making it any easier to collect, but adds to the adventure, and keeps me in shape!  S."
771853,dhickey,2013-03-05 01:39:00,1038,When I was a kid we ran a 4x12 multy stage boiler and about 3000 trees it is one of the best memories so far. Getting up at 5 am feeding cattel pigs chickens gathering eggs and going in for breafast then heading out on the sleds up to the boiler shack to get the fire up  and running and then go get the sap for the day we were usualy done at about 2-4 depending on how many people were out tipping buckets. Then it was off to the lake on the sleds to play hockey or fish usualy both.. Then back for the evening chours and Supper and back up to the boiler to cut wood check the buckets and stoke the boiler for the nite..  I want to be a kid again....  Salty.
771854,Sinker,2013-03-05 01:47:00,8692,"Yep, good times Salty. Seems to be a thing of the past nowadays. Not many people doing it anymore. I just enjoy the time outdoors, and my son likes it too. People ask me all the time if its really ""worth"" it, and my reply is its priceless. Its not about how much syrup you make, or how much it costs to make it, its about spending time outdoors with family and friends, when most people are deep in cabin fever  S."
771858,Sinker,2013-03-05 02:01:00,8692,"Nice light coloured first run syrup. I'm not sure this pic will work, I have issues with my phone on this site.  "
771859,Sinker,2013-03-05 02:02:00,8692,All I get is a red X.......anyone else see pic?
771860,irishfield,2013-03-05 02:03:00,26272,Yah it's up Shane!
771864,Christopheraaron,2013-03-05 02:21:00,3525,"I see it, looks good  I would do it but we just don't have enough maples around here."
771895,fishindevil,2013-03-05 08:46:00,6254,Looks good Shane !!!!! I have seen lots of lines going up and guys checking the last week or so while I was snowmobiling !!!!! If you are interested the Sunderland maple strop festival is April 5-7 th in Sunderland the whole town comes out for it !!!! Pretty cool they are all in te bush now getting the sap the news said its going to be a bumper crop of sap this year !!!!! Cool.    Good luck guys ....
771924,Ralph Field,2013-03-05 14:58:00,1018,"As teenagers my friend and I collected sap , then we had his mother boil it on their stove. When they went to check on the pot in the morning they discovered that the steam from the pot had caused their wallpaper to peel off the walls. That was the end of our maple syrup days."
771926,TJQ,2013-03-05 15:15:00,7806,"I'm getting the sugar shack cleaned up and ready to go.. W'ere gearing up for our season which usually starts mid march. after my Dad's mishap last year we missed a year. I did this video with my Dad a few years back.  Were gonna have to start the season with skidoo's instead of the tractor though there's gotta be 3-4 feet of snow in the bush.  Lots of work to get ready to go... we have 300 trees we can do, I think I'm gonna stick to around 125 around the shack for my first go at this alone.   Except for last year, weve been in ""production"" for 30 odd years. Our best year was 65 gallons. We've always done everything old school... and its gonna stay that way. Syrup is done (for commercial purposes) when its boiling temperature is 7 degrees above 212 (219) we always boil to 219.5-220, for a little thicker, sweeter syrup."
771941,Cast-Away,2013-03-05 17:41:00,790,"Cool video TJ, especially in black & white. It really gives it the old fashion feel!"
771943,lakerguy,2013-03-05 18:14:00,224,We run a small operation here too just 50 trees.Its fun... family comes over drinks my beer....watch the sap boil then leave with free maple syrup lol  Gotta love it  Great video T.J
771944,TJQ,2013-03-05 18:16:00,7806,Ahhh family... lol...
771945,lew,2013-03-05 18:29:00,12766,"That's a great video TJ, thanks for posting that."
771962,Sinker,2013-03-05 20:09:00,8692,"I dunno what's up but vids or pics don't show up on my phone on this site. I was hoping it would be a bit warmer today to get the sap running, but its a little too cold. Should be a great season this year!  S."
771966,NAW,2013-03-05 20:19:00,4022,"Sinker,  My neighbor put a few pails out every year.  Boils is over flames, in an old stainless sink.  I took a quick look at his set up last year.  But this year, I am going to take a real good look, and try to learn a few things.  if he has any really cool things going on, I'll send you some pictures.  He is an inventor, so most of his stuff is home made.  Sure would be a good tradition to start as a family thing."
771970,irishfield,2013-03-05 20:27:00,26272,Best part is emptying those Old Special bottles so you have something for the syrup !!
771978,fishnsled,2013-03-05 21:30:00,3520," In case you were wondering ...they don't have to be Old Special bottles.  Those empty vodka and rum bottles after a weekend at Bernie's should work just as well.  Having never made syrup before, I could be wrong.   I'd certainly like to try doing it one of these days.  Need to find some trees and permission to do so.  Great video TJ!!  Great looking first batch Sinker."
772017,Weeds,2013-03-06 00:40:00,782,"Right on. I gave it a go two years ago. Made possibly the smallest batch of Maple syrup ever produced  from the two maple trees in my backyard. Think I ended up with around a 1/2 of a cup. It was so clear it made me uncertain if I was even using the right trees. The leaves in the spring confirmed I was right. It was fun, I should get out there. Maybe ramp up production to a full cup this year."
772045,Sinker,2013-03-06 03:00:00,8692,"Weeds, you can store sap for a long time if its kept cool. Mine is frozen solid right now. Store it up until you get a 5 gal pail, then you will get about 2 cups lol.  Like I said, its not how much you get, its doing the whole process, and spending time outdoors.  I like to do things old school as well. The propane burner is not quite a fire, but I'm going to boil a big batch over a fore once I have a full barrel collected. Should be able to empty a few bottles of the good stuff watching that boil lol  S."
772047,Sinker,2013-03-06 03:06:00,8692,"And yeah, the sap is gin clear. The syrup made from the first run of sap is also very light in colour, and has the highest sugar content. The later you collect, the darker the syrup will be once boiled.   How are you filtering yours TJ? And do you filter it before you get to your preferred temp, or at that temp?  I'm finding if I filter it before its at temp, it does a nicer job. I then run it thru a cone coffee filter into my bottles.  Works for me....  S."
772049,TJQ,2013-03-06 03:17:00,7806,"Thanks guys... we don't filter..  we pour off in 5 gallon batches an have a 1/2 stainless steel drum... Poured in at boiliog it takes a while to cool and we just let it settle and siphon off the top..  Does a great job and no messing around with filtering.. we do our very best to prefilter everything through cloth and then through 6"" milk filters before it goes into the vats.  Spent my evening cleaning out the boilers, got some repairs to do before we can start."
772051,Sinker,2013-03-06 03:22:00,8692,"Interesting. Good idea. I've been filtering mine thru cheesecloth before storing, then thru a felt bag filter when its almost boiled, then once finished, pour it thru the coffee filter in a funnel into the bottles.  Maybe I'm over killing it? I guess you can never be too safe, but it is a bit of a PITA.....  Will check your vid out later this week.  S."
