849243,BillM,2014-04-21 23:59:00,17367,Those poor fish are going to get slaughtered!  S.  It's too bad the MNR can't change the opener when water conditions call for it.
849252,solopaddler,2014-04-22 00:32:00,8605," It's too bad the MNR can't change the opener when water conditions call for it.  I can remember them doing this once many years ago, so there has been a precedent. Too late now though,"
849303,Sinker,2014-04-22 04:15:00,8692,"I remember that too, Mike.  MNR=Ministry of No Results....   Its not gonna be pretty...  S."
849315,Garnet,2014-04-22 10:43:00,2056,I'm sure glad the run will be spread threw the whole water shed and not backed up behind the dam.
849457,esoxansteel,2014-04-22 21:45:00,1307," It's too bad the MNR can't change the opener when water conditions call for it.      They closed off the lower Ganaraska River in the mid 1980s when the entire run was below Corbetts dam, it can be done, with a little effort, and the run was over 15,000 then, at least theres some fish blowing through the ladder now, to at least spread then out"
849461,esoxansteel,2014-04-22 21:58:00,1307,"Should have read further before reporting, and combining Mikes and Garnets thread and repeating whats already been said, Back then we had Dave and Arnold who were the area biologist who actually cared about the resourse, and spent many unpaid hours working at the ladder along with the dedicated members of the GSA, and they were there on a daily basis during the steelhead run."
849685,chessy,2014-04-23 21:15:00,610,the town can slap a no trespass order up in under 24 hours.. will that happen .. not likely as they don't care  hell they let them boat throughout the sanctuary all in the name of making money
849686,misfish,2014-04-23 21:30:00,29133,"Can not tell a lie here. When I was in my younger years,I couldnt wait for the spring opener.. Ya caught my fair share and kept them. Now I think back and more aware of what I did and how bad they tasted,I truely respect the spring run and dont even bother anymore. I would sooner fish for residents now and release them to play with for many years later.  I will fish for drop backs later . C&R only. They have had their fun and done the funky thang.  Bring on the fall run.  Most have to remember,if they are not breaking any laws (although unethic as it seems to be to many) we need to step back an let be. Yes, we can educate them,just by saying a few words ,but then again,this has been the way.  Only time and ageing, will hopefully make them see, as it has for me."
