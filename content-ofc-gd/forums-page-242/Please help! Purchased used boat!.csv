I know there have been posts on this in the past but there are mixed answers everywhere!!  I have just bought a used boat...  I have all the VINS, I have transferred ownership of trailer into my name, got new plates for the trailer and now am left to switch ownership of boat into my name....  I have called service canada, transport canada and even CRA, and no one can give me a clear answer...  As far as I know, I am supposed to MAIL IN a 'pleasure craft license application' with bill of sale and piece of ID, and then the ownership of the boat is now under my name....  Correct??  Am I missing something.  Am I not supposed to pay tax on this purchase at some point? Will they send me a bill?  Any info would be greatly appreciated!"
850102,misfish,2014-04-25 21:49:00,29133,Get a hold of Rick. The guy you bought it from. Im sure he can help you out.
850103,fishingguy28,2014-04-25 21:52:00,98,I think I have pestered him enough  hahaha
850104,Gerritt,2014-04-25 21:52:00,6129,Walk into a service canada office and have it done there. Takes 20 minutes  Don't be surprised if you get a bill years later for taxes on the hull and motor. You would have already paid taxes on the trailer.
850106,misfish,2014-04-25 21:59:00,29133,"I think I have pestered him enough  hahaha  Ah he,s a good fella. Im sure he dosent mind helping .  Pester away. LOL"
850108,davey buoy,2014-04-25 22:01:00,5505,"When I transfered my ownership to my name,had to be sent to Halifax?4 weeks later it was sent back with my name on the registration.To send there a form had to be filled plus copy of Birth certificate,bill of sale for boat only and pictures of the registration #'s on the sides.Photo of drivers license as well.I may of over did it."
850109,hirk,2014-04-25 22:04:00,571,"Dont think service canada offices do this anymore. Your right about what to mail and you can use it right away if it has numbers on it,they allow 90 days for you to get your numbers and put them on."
850110,davey buoy,2014-04-25 22:07:00,5505,"Dont think service canada offices do this anymore. Your right about what to mail and you can use it right away if it has numbers on it,they allow 90 days for you to get your numbers and put them on. No they don't.Picked up the transfer forms from city Hall in Barrie. Don't forget a picture of the model and serial # plate."
850113,fishingguy28,2014-04-25 22:15:00,98,Hmmm thanks guys... People on transport canada never mentioned anything bout the license # pictures on the boat but maybe I will send with the form just in case!  I'm assuming they will send bill then... I sure won't go chasing to pay the tax man
850117,Gerritt,2014-04-25 22:24:00,6129,Really? That sucks.... Given all the Bull fishing border waters you would think they would want this service easily accessible.

People on transport canada never mentioned anything bout the license # pictures on the boat but maybe I will send with the form just in case! I'm assuming they will send bill then... I sure won't go chasing to pay the tax man Take pictures of all sides and just print them on paper copies. They sent everything back which was funny.I think they must of photo copied my pics as well .lol.
850122,grt1,2014-04-25 22:44:00,638,"when I got a couple 14 foot tinnies, I just sent a letter to Canada customs with the information on the boats and they sent me the numbers for the boat and they were under my name. mind you about 5 years later the province sent in a letter demanding tax on the boats . since I was given the boats I had to get the guy who gave them to me to sign a form saying no money changed hands and that he was going to junk them. they a few years later the province asked for the tax on them again and I had to go through the same process again."
850129,moxie,2014-04-25 23:10:00,1566,Prefer not to elaborate on specifics due to potentially incriminating factors but taxes on hulls and outboards on a private sale? BUHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!
850130,sneak_e_pete,2014-04-25 23:13:00,540,"Literally just got my pleasure craft license in the mail yesterday.  Filled out the form, included bill of sale and photocopy of Driver License and had my license in 2 weeks.  No pictures of the boat are required."
850143,fishingguy28,2014-04-25 23:54:00,98,Awsomeeeeee info gents!!! Thanks a bunch! Mailing Info tomorrow!!!

850160,spincast,2014-04-26 01:00:00,3279,Me thinks you worry too much Anthony.  Obviously things have changed since I bought her and you just walked into a service Canada office. I would just mail in the form we did last night to the address here as I mentioned. http://www.tc.gc.ca/eng/marinesafety/debs-obs-paperwork-paperwork_boat_licence-3212.htm Let them worry about the taxes. In the meantime you got gas money
850163,fishingguy28,2014-04-26 01:10:00,98,Thanks rick.... I have been day dreaming since I picked her up!!!!
