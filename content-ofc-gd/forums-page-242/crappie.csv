848739,moxie,2014-04-19 02:09:00,1566,A very vague question..... Seeking a very specific answer.
848740,jackal68,2014-04-19 02:10:00,68,sorry i meant around the brantford area sorry
848748,Gerritt,2014-04-19 02:22:00,6129,"Don't take this the wrong way, but I did a search on this site using Brantford Crappie.... You have asked this exact same question several times and have been given several replies. Did some new lake magically appear in the Brantford area since 2010 when you began to start threads asking about spots in the Brantford area to fish them?only so many lakes/ponds in that area and I am sure they are not secret magical crappie Meccas that have appeared since then. On the other hand... There are waterways away from Brantford that do have glorified sunfish in them... Expand your horizons?"
848773,pics,2014-04-19 04:55:00,1268,Crappie spots are a closely guarded secret.. you have to do the legwork and find out where they are.... Good luck
848786,bobkayla,2014-04-19 11:39:00,148,Turkey point canals always have good numbers of crappie
