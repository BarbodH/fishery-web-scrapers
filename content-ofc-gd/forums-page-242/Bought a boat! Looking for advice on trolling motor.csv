It was a sweet deal and I jumped on it.  Pretty excited to pick it up tomorrow.  It doesn't have a trolling motor so I'll have to add one to it.  Any recommendations in terms of thrust and shaft length and also thoughts on which makes are best?  Thanks and a great thank you to all the helpful replies in my previous posts.  They were very helpful in the process."

849931,fishnguy,2014-04-25 00:29:00,96,"What type of fishing do you plan to do?  I do a lot of working shorelines and some jigging over reefs.  I looked at the ipilots but don't think I'd use the features enough to justify the price.  Leaning towards a 24v, 70 lb thrust, 50"" shaft sort of setup.  Just a ""standard"" bow mount trolling motor without the bells and whistles is what I'm thinking.  Any thoughts on Minn Kota vs Motorguide?"
849934,BillM,2014-04-25 00:41:00,17367,"As big as you can afford.  I've got a 60in, 8olb Terrova with I-Pilot Link and it's awesome..  Especially when it's hooked up to the HB 898c HD SI.  I can control everything from the drivers seat.   The longer shaft is great when it gets bouncy out there (keeps the prop in the water even in the rough stuff)"
849938,leaf4,2014-04-25 00:52:00,2466,"Personal preference here, but minn kota, the girlfriends father has a motor guide and it does the trick but can be a nuisance especially when your foot pedal batteries decide to die on you with no warning lol. also the pedal doesn't have an option to plug into a 12v or anything to run off of that instead of the batteries once they are dead"
849942,BillM,2014-04-25 01:15:00,17367,"Also, unless you want to keep you foot on the trolling motor 100% of the time, you don't want a cable steer.  Leave those for the bass boats"
849943,Pigeontroller,2014-04-25 01:16:00,2793,"I was going to recomend at least 24v/80 lbs trust. Don't make the mistake of getting an underpowered electric. Shaft length is important too, 48"" might be ok on perfectly flat water but will be popping out of the water in a chop."
849968,Stoty,2014-04-25 06:24:00,2910,I'd agree with a few comments... 80lb/24v system would be plenty for that boat. Minn Kota - hands down.
849972,buckhorn250,2014-04-25 10:28:00,85,Another vote for the Minnkota Terrova...great unit with a ton of features...but its the construction that impressed me. Its a much more solid unit then the Motorguide I replaced. Definitely worth the extra bucks.
849973,lew,2014-04-25 10:38:00,12766,"80 pound Fortrex with a 62"" shaft for me, outstanding motor."
850011,wannabefisherman,2014-04-25 15:51:00,19,"80 lb, 60"" shaft for sure.  when the wind picks up, or fishing current, you will be glad the extra thrust and shaft is there. and despite what you think about the ipilot - get it. you will appreciate spot lock and autopilot. once you use it you can't go back!"
850053,Raf,2014-04-25 18:36:00,3495,"50"" shaft will be too short on that boat.  70lb thrust will be adequate but not ideal."
