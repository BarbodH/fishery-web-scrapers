849230,Sinker,2014-04-21 23:40:00,8692,"This is another reason to get max HP.  Take it out on a calm day. Every boat handles different. It may take you a full day or more to get the ""feel"" for it.  Move some weight around while your at it.  I would make trim tabs a last resort.  One thing I love about my boat is how easy it gets on plane. Half throttle, even with a full load, and she gets right on top. I went thru a couple different props, and trim settings to find the ""sweet"" spot though.  Good luck, im sure it will work out for ya!  S."
849239,didoban,2014-04-21 23:49:00,65,"Check the cavitation plate, the optimum position should be parallel to the hull.  The motor is probably mounted too high, the reason porpoising on take off is an issue."
849247,Pigeontroller,2014-04-22 00:09:00,2793,"I have a light 16' Lund Sendero (1000 lb. hull) and I put a Yamaha F90 on it in 2005, never had any issues...It performed great with an Aluminum 21P prop, and even better with a SS 19P. I was concerned about the weight when I purchased the motor...Anyway, I would be very unhappy with a dealer that sold me a package that performed that way...Definately get in out on calm water, better yet take the dealer with you! Maybe call another dealer..."
849251,jedimaster,2014-04-22 00:26:00,3472,I would relocate the batteries as a start. The way to check it without doing the work is to just add a weight to the front like I mentioned. This will give you a rough idea of the amount of weight you need to move forward without changing anything. Keep in mind though you only want to move just enough weight forward as is required. The more weight you move tot he front the more prop slip you will encounter as the lever effect will force you to run extra trim to keep the bow up at wot. Moving weigh forward gets you out to the water faster and at slower speeds but decrease your top end. If you have two or three batteries moving just those to the bow will make a huge difference.  Especially if you are already able to get on plane. I had a boat that wouldn't plane out at all. as in no way. I moved one battery forward and bingo problem solved.  I would setup the boat as properly as I could before I started adding things like trim tabs. jmho.

849255,Terry,2014-04-22 00:37:00,14456,is the trim working right
849256,EME411,2014-04-22 00:38:00,13,"I have purchased two new boat packages through a local dealer and they always took me out with a rep/tech to ensure that the boat performed to my expatiations, The first boat we tried three different  props before I was satisfied"
849258,solopaddler,2014-04-22 00:42:00,8605,"Most are right, I probably have too much weight on the back but that should have been something the dealer should have known and told me about.  That's exactly what I thought when we bought our Smokercraft.  FWIW a 90 is max hp for the boat I bought, but the 4 stroke Merc was too heavy. The gas tank is right at the back which didn't help. I moved all the batteries right into the bow and that did virtually nothing.  As I said we exhausted every single option before giving up. I mulled over a smaller 4 stroke but ultimately went with a 90 etec as it's considerably lighter and still max hp. It's like a different boat now. Night and day.  Good luck, I've been down this road already and I feel your pain."
849267,landry,2014-04-22 00:58:00,1005,Wow - I hope your boat is different than Mikes BUT it does not sound good. You have owned boats before so Believe your gut if it tells you something is not right. That is just Bull - I would be so royally pissed off if that happened to me. I would get back in there ASAP and demand a different engine. They can surely ran yours up and sell it as new on a different rig. They should know how a package performs if they are selling it.
849278,mike rousseau,2014-04-22 01:34:00,4661,This reminds me of the sinking tracker....  You end up slapping some tabs to cover up a serious issue... then you'll end up in bad conditions and sink you overweighted boat...   Think safety when you weigh your options...
849286,ctered,2014-04-22 01:53:00,40,I would hold off on trim tabs until you do some more testing. You should not need trim tabs on any 17 foot boat. Like has been suggested above you need to move some weight forward in your boat. Another issue I believe is that you are under propped. You should be in a 17 or 19 inch prop with cupping. A 4 blade will give you stern lift and cupping will allow it to plane at lower speeds. The bow lift is causing your problem. You need a prop to give you stern lift. Dealers are not the best at propping new boats. They prop for general use. Everyone will load there boat differently and thus require a different prop. Also as mentioned is the use of a hydrofoil. That will get the boat on plane faster and also hold it on plane at lower speeds.
849291,F7Firecat,2014-04-22 02:23:00,347,"I think you have a propping issue, not enough torque to get it on plane, you need to drop on pitch to get better lift out of the hole, also you need to know what your running for top rpm also, dropping pitch will increase top rpms, but at this point getting it to plain is more important than the top end rpms.  If its new the dealer should be taking care of this problem not you, they should supply you with the right equipment to get it to plane properly."
849293,dhickey,2014-04-22 02:46:00,1038,Just a simple thought.  Balance is the key.  If its boats/trucks/trailers/planes/canoes or even pond boats.. If the load isn't balanced with regard to power then you will have problems.
849323,BillM,2014-04-22 11:35:00,17367,"I still think one of your main issues is the prop..  I can't even believe there's a 15P on there.  17-19 at a minimum like ctered mentioned above.

849328,fisher,2014-04-22 12:00:00,451,"I want to thank everyone for their input.  It has been great to get everyone's insight/opinion before I speak to the marina that sold me the boat.  As you all have empathized with, it has been a very stressful experience thus far.  Moving from a 20 year old boat that was working fine to a new boat that is at the point where I wouldn't feel safe in with more than 5-10 km hour winds is very disheartening.  Although I am not yet regretting the purchase, I am not far from it if this does not get solved - but I think there is hope.  I understand balance is the problem - too much weight in the back - but I can't realistically eliminate weight from the back of the boat (I need/want both engines and don't want to downgrade to a lower HP to save a few pounds - not even sure that would be enough), The gas tank is where it is - can't relocate that and there is only 1 battery in the back.  The rear bench is probably 50 lbs and I need the bench for seating.  Aside from adding more weight to the front, there is not much else I can do to fix the weight distribution issue and I don't want to add more weight to the front if I can find another way.  From reading the web and PMs from members here, porpoising is a very common issue with Smokercraft but smart tabs seems to be the solution that is overwhelmingly referred to from members here and throughout the net.  It's unfortunate that this is the way I have to go, but if it gets the rig to the point that I can enjoy it and feel sale in it, then that's fine with me (a it has been for others).  As for the rig being overweight to the point that is will sink, I don't believe that is the case.  It has a splashwell at the rear of the boat, and it did not have water coming in (or if it did, the water would shoot right back out).  If the top of the transom (where the motor cutout is located) was sitting much lower, then I'd be concerned.  As I have said previously. I will be calling the dealer this morning to get their thoughts on solving this problem.  In fairness to them, while I am upset at them that this is happening, I have not yet brought to their attention to give them the chance to respond/act.  The following is being posted as future reference for anyone else on the board that may experience similar issues with Smokercraft or any other boat (or for anyone else that may search the web).  From these posts on the net, it appears there is a viable solution - whether it be a different prop or tabs (I just need to find what mine will be).  This from Walleye Central suggesting a different prop: http://www.walleyecentral.com/forums/showthread.php?t=316850&page=2  ""A very good friend has a 2008~ 172 Pro Angler with a 115 Opti. I've fished out of it MANY times. It's been a pretty solid boat for him. No major issues that I recall. It has the tan carpet which he hates and wishes it had center rod storage. It's definitely not a dry ride in 3 footers and likes to porpoise with a heavy load but not a deal breaker by any means. Getting the right prop will make all the difference with this boat. If you are pulling kids go with a 17P SS. ""  This from e-Nation and according to some of the posts, it looks like Smokercraft knows of the issue and sent this one guy some tabs to install to fix it (guy never reposted on the outcome of those tabs):  http://community.evinrude.com/t5/Owner-s-Zone/porposing-problem-smoker-craft-172xl/td-p/11989"
849337,sneak_e_pete,2014-04-22 13:53:00,540,"Great post Fisher.  Being a former Smokercraft owner (loved the boat) I had the same problem, was 10hp under max and there was no additional weight in the rear other than what is factory.  It shoulda ran better without tabs, but it didnt.  Put the tabs on...dream ride.  No offense to other posts, but IMO weight distribution (i.e. filling front livewell) is also a bandaid option.  Hope all works out for you and that you end up really enjoying your boat!!!"
849342,hirk,2014-04-22 14:33:00,571,"Get a prop designed for stern lift, it will be stainless and pricey but  should be a big improvement. A  cav. plate fin will help keep the nose down when your running slow and the last fix is adding a jackplate to improve your load carrying but this would likely void your warranty ."
849343,fisher,2014-04-22 14:54:00,451,"Spoke to the manager at the marina.  He is going to contact Smokercraft to see their recommendation or if they have had other similar issues with my set up.  He said he had same complaint with a different model last year and Smokercraft sent them some fixed tabs to install.  He said that cured the problem.  He also spoke of looking at the prop to ensure max RPMs, etc are being maintained and something else about spray, speed, etc...when we go for a test run when the lake they are on is ice free.  So looks like things will get resolved eventually.  Until then, I will see how it handles in calm waters, although as I stated earflier, it is the rough water handling that I am very concerned about and handling in those conditions has already proven terrible.  At least the calm water test will allow me to see if this issue also exists in that condition and have something to compare to in case the water is calm the day I go back to the dealer.  Will keep you all posted."

I bought a new Skeeter/Yamaha 5 years ago and wanted an SS prop and to be sure I got the best one possible for my rig I phoned Skeeter in Texas and told them how I wanted to use the boat. They told me which prop would best suit my needs and that's the one I had the dealer install and it works perfectly.  It was probably a bit easier in my situation seeing as Yamaha owns Skeeter and it wasn't difficult for them to figure which prop would be best, but I'm sure in your case either Smokercraft or Merc  should be able to figure out what would give you the optimal performance.  If you don't have a tach, you'll need one  to know what your rev's are at top end to be sure everything is trimmed properly."

849127,fisher,2014-04-21 13:40:00,451,"I just picked up my new smokercraft 172 last week and took it to Lake Ontario yesterday to begin the break in of the 115 and 9.9 mercurys.  (By the way, port credit launch was blocked by fair rides covering the parking lot. What were they thinking?  Anyway, I headed to bronte and launched there - for $17!)  So, while on the lake which had a chop due to the 20 km east winds , the big motor would cause the bow to ride pretty high and would only plane out at the higher end of the speed range (this was hard on the boat since at this speed the chop was causing the boat to come down hard on the water every so often).  I couldn't run it at mid speed (which would have been ideal) since the boat rode so high and I couldn't see in front of me.  I had to stand and that was pretty uncomfortable. Plus the back end was so low to the water it was not comforting at all.  It was obvious the boat was not handing well. So I was left having to come in pretty slow.  By the way, I ran into the marine police out there.  Nice guys.  Just asked me what I was doing and if I was fishing.  Asked if I had all my safety stuff and to call *16 on my cell if I ran into trouble.  Didn't stop me to check. Instead they only carried on the conversation while they rode beside me.  Really good to see them out there with a genuine caring attitude.   Anyway I am going to call the dealer (who is 2 hours away) to get his thoughts and suggestions but wanted some opinions here first.  I have heard the following: 1) move the motor down a notch or two (right now it is in the middle bolt position) but it is already riding low to the water (so I don't like that idea).  This was one if the two suggestoons by the marine police 2) I also heard about possible prop pitch issue (currently has a 15P prop according to what is on the prop).  This was marine polices second suggestion.  3) I read online that smart tabs might help.  I can't believe I have to spend money to make a new boat work properly.  Anyone have experience or opinion on this issue and any possible solution that worked for them they care to share before I call the dealer?  Note the stern appears to be heavy loaded.  It has the 2 engines, the gas tank which was half full with 50 litres of gas and one of the two batteries.  But the boat is rated for a 140 and it has a 115 and 9.9 (so that appears to be well within the weight guidance that the boat was designed for). Just a frustrating experience to say the least.  I also am curious if you think the chop may have made the issue much worse and maybe wouldn't be an issue in calmer water (I am not sure when I can get out again next to test this but nonetheless, the boat definitely should have handled better in that chop).  Thanks and sorry for the long post."
849128,BillM,2014-04-21 13:46:00,17367,"I'd probably get it out on some calmer water before making too much out of your maiden voyage.  20km east winds on Lake O would be quite choppy.  You are either going to smash into the waves or you need to get up on top of them, you won't get this going half throttle  You shouldn't require smart tabs to have a boat plane properly, that's just a bandaid solution."

849138,fisher,2014-04-21 14:51:00,451,"It's not my first boat.  I may not have explained it properly but my previous boat with a smaller motor and smaller length would not handle like that.  It would not ride high.  It would plain at lower rpm/speed.  In fact I have been in much rougher water with my previous smaller boat and it handled much, much better.  Basically  I felt safer in my older boat in much rougher waters.  The point is that if I ever got caught out in rough water in this new boat I would not feel comfortable and something is definitely wrong and needs to be fixed.  It should not be this way.  I have since read up some more on smart tabs and cannot believe the positive experiences from so many users with boats of various sizes.  They explain the same issue as I have and then after installing these tabs they their problem is completely solved and in many cases with significany performance improvement and even top end speed gain.   In one case the guy was about to sellhis boat but then got the tabs and couldn't believe the improvement to overall performance.  I know something needs to be done with the boat But agree that I should take it out in calmer water so I know where it stands in that condition as well for future comparison."

In my case we tried every possible fix, adjusting the height of the motor, different prop, etc, etc. Ultimately a hydrofoil on the skeg made it at least usable but I wasn't happy with the situation as it was a bandaid fix.  The issue was pretty simple in my case, the motor was simply too heavy for the boat. Last spring we sold the Merc and put a 90 e-tec on the boat and it runs like a dream now. The lighter motor made all the difference in the world.  My guess is you may have a similar issue with the 115 simply being too heavy. By far the best bandaid fix would be a set of trim tabs, if you're looking for a quick fix that's the route I would go."

849193,jedimaster,2014-04-21 20:07:00,3472,"Lots of boats when they get near there weight limit have issues getting on plane. Take some ballast and put it in the bow and see how that changes the ride. You can try a 4 or 5 blade prop that will also get you up quicker but you will increase slip and lose a bit on the top end.Does your prop have vent holes? If it does try opening the vent holes and see if you can get on plane faster. Some boats I have been in you gotta realy hammer it to get on plane then once on plane you can back off. No boat rides the same. I had a stratos I had to hammer the heck out of to get it on plane than I could cut the throttle way back. my lund I could just sneak up slowly and get on plane. You probably have a number of things going on. Too much weight in the back. Possibly a prop that isn't suited for the boat or weight, not enough trim(Trim tabs can help, a whale tail will help, also you can wedge the motor to give you more trim). If you are able to get on plane than you are a whole lot further ahead than what you think. I have seen people not even able to get on plane in a new boat. Sounds like you are probably a bit of weight a bit too far back. if you have access to some lower pitched props, or a high five, or a 4 blade prop, give that a try. I would bet that a 5 pitch prop 1 degree lower than what you have would get you comfy."
849196,davew3,2014-04-21 20:14:00,430,To much weight on the stern.   Take the 9.9 off and see what happens.  If it rides better look for a lighter main motor.  Very unsafe to ride like that.  If emergency power down you may have the wake come right on in.   Regards

Sounds like too much motor weight. Try moving your two trolling motor batteries and anchor to the bow (yes I know the bouncing can be bad on the batteries). A new prop may help. Take a pic of the transom so we can see how low the boat transom is sitting in the water at rest and post it too. How heavy is the motor?? My 16' crestliner has a 350lb 75 optimax on it.

Wouldn't have been the first boat rigged this way that would have been sold by them. Nonetheless I'll give them a call tomorrow and very curious about what they will say.The weight is 399 lbs for main motor plus one battery plus 50 litres gas plus a 9.9 kicker plus an optional bench seat. Whatever it totals, it is a lot.The more I read and understand about trim tabs the more it makes sense that it will solve my problem. I don't consider it a bandaid solution but rather a necessity to compensate for this additional weight. In any event, it is the dealer I am not happy with at the moment, but we will see what they say.I have the boat stored in my dad's garage so can't see right now how the main motor is sitting in relation to the transom when fully trimmed down. I imagine it is in not enough of an angle to get it to push the stern up enough to get the bow down, probably because of the excess weight. Trim tabs should compensate for this.Incredible how common this is when I search the net.I'll try to remember to post a pic of the boat/ transom in the water. May be a week or so."

It seems like a common issue.  A lot dealers have never really run the boats they sell...sad but true."
