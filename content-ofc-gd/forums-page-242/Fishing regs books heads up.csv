850047,JoshS,2014-04-25 18:12:00,729,Personally I don't have a problem with printing less regs. Sounds like the business case makes a lot of sense. Like said there are tons of ways to get the info. But there are good arguements on either side and I can understand how having a hard copy handy is helpful for some. But does it make enough sense to keep spending the money printing them? It would be great if those that need a copy can request one if need be. Hopefully the money saved here is going to good use!
850048,craigdritchie,2014-04-25 18:12:00,1586,Here's your license but its an extra 5 bucks for a copy of the rules...no...we pay enough that they can print the rules and give us a copy.  They get enough ad revenue off them to cover it anyway.  I would be very surprised if ad revenues cover even 25 percent of their costs.
850057,bare foot wader,2014-04-25 18:49:00,1354,"No, because I, as a taxpayer, think they could spend my money better...instead of catering to a bunch of guys who don't want to adapt to some incredibly easy changes  They are still printing regs, just not as many...so I don't understand what all the fuss is about...print them at home, at a library, download to a mobile device...it's pretty dang easy to get the regs  Get a copy, hold onto it, don't take 3 copies to start fires with"

You can look it up on your smart phone while driving also.....maybe thats a trap also?

849586,craigdritchie,2014-04-23 11:46:00,1586,"Back in the early 1990s MNR approached a bunch of magazine publishers to see if one of them wanted to take over responsibility for publishing the fishing regs for them. We looked into it, figuring it would be a no-brainer to sell a bunch of ads into the booklet and make some great money. But once we got a look at the actual costs of printing and distributing these things, we said no thanks and walked away. The printing expense was just enormous, but the real killer was the warehousing and shipping cost. By the time you printed the thing and got it into people's hands, the cost was over seven figures, and that's in 1994 dollars.  As much as I also like having a paper reg book, I can totally understand why MNR wants to get rid of that expense every spring. The regs booklet is a huge expense that comes directly out of MNR's operating budget. Personally, I would rather see them spend my tax dollars on fish and wildlife management than to simply give it away to a trucking company every year."

He says trout season closes last Saturday of September. I tell him it's Sept 30. He disagrees. I pull out my regulations booklet and show him. I then rush to his car, jot down his licence plate. He asks why am I doing that? I tell him he is in violation of the Fish & Wildlife Conservation act 1997 for obstructing my fishing by throwing a rock into the water and disturbing the fish (I also had several pages I printed off in my jacket which I did show him). I threatened to report him to the MNR. He apologized profusely.  I always like to have the regulations booklet on me if I can get a copy.

The problems with internet apps are several when away from home.  What if you do not own a cell phone or Ipad? Connection problems? Server down? No cell service in the more remote areas.  At least when I have a copy in my vehicle, the information is always accessible"

849371,BillM,2014-04-22 16:36:00,17367,You should know the regs well before you're on the water...... Just sayin'
849374,Jds63,2014-04-22 16:58:00,1365,Heard there is no shortage of mandarin printed reg books in the GTA  what the hell !!!! ... that comment is totaly not needed

Just sayin'  Yes I know what you are saying Bill, I always research regs prior to going out but , sometimes you could be in a situation where you have a unplanned opportunity to fish and need regs readily available ... i always keep a current copy in my truck"

Maybe Fidel and I can scrounge up some French ones, while we're at it.  ""De pêche, you cannot do dat ici, là. Ok?""

849378,bare foot wader,2014-04-22 17:06:00,1354,"how many guys take 5 copies and lose or trash them?  I'd be ok if they charged a few bucks for the regs, build the cost into the licence, get one reg book every year and keep care of it  wonder how much they charge for the advertising in them, doesn't sound like sponsors are getting their money worth, if MNR isn't printing too many of them"
849379,bigugli,2014-04-22 17:09:00,6138,"You should know the regs well before you're on the water...... Just sayin' That only works for planned trips. Unless you expect people to have the regs memorized line for line. Many times I've been on the road, for work, or visiting, and had spare time to drop a line in a new body of water Hard copy map and regs on hand removes all doubts."

Ya Bill , i think the frustration is the constant cutbacks to the MNR budget is what really irks us ... i know there are more efficient uses of technology now to deliver services , so as with any change it will just take time"
849384,mike rousseau,2014-04-22 17:22:00,4661,Little tip for anyone with an iPhone...  I take screen shots of the regs on the MNR web site by lining up what you want to save... Then press both the power/screen buttons... Viola... Regs saved to your phone...  Then you have em on the water and you don't bed cell signal...  Or you can even make prints to have paper copies...

You can also load the entire PDF in your iBooks (which you can download free from the iStore). That way, once downloaded, you don't need any kind of connection to read them. That's how they become your iRegs.  You might need a magnifying glass , but you won't need any kind of connection.  p.-"

849393,Oggie,2014-04-22 18:01:00,588,I agree with you but they don't post sanctuaries very well or extended fall rainbow seasons. They expect you to check and know. Easy to do as long as you fish the same rivers all the time. Dan O.

If the government is unable to publish its laws.... How can it enforce them? Lawyers will have a field day with this.  if they are so bent on using technology and eliminating the book regs, then perhaps when someone gets a fishing license the MNR sends them a copy of the regs in some kind of format ... that might eliminate the "" I can't find a copy"" defense  and if you are a senior and the use of technology is not easy for you .. you are out of luck  we waste almost a billion on a gas plant but  the govt nickels and dimes over this kind of stuff ... assuming that what the OP said is true"

Are those the same people doing 80km/h in 50km/h zone because they didn't see a speed limit sign?    Zero excuse for not knowing the regs in the zone you are fishing."

849407,Gerritt,2014-04-22 18:49:00,6129,"Big difference here. The example you gave is inadequate, the government in your example has published the law, being 50km/h available for all to see.  In terms of the regs, not everyone will have a copy, not everyone has high speed internet, especially in rural areas to download a copy.  Your are not even close to comparing the same things."

So those people in rural areas don't have phones either?   Can't call up the MNR and ask about the regs?  Anymore excuses you'd like to share with us for not knowing the regulations in a FMZ you're fishing?  If someone wants to figure out the regs they will, if not they won't.   You're crazy to think a judge will toss a case out of court when the guy who was 13 walleye over his limit stands up and says 'Well the Canadian Tire didn't have a copy of the regs and my dial up internet was too slow to download the PDF'  If anything, the regulations are even more available today then they were 15 years ago."
