BTW its $100 each for car and boat for the season."

849578,Rich,2014-04-23 10:44:00,3927,My season pass for LPRCA allows a vehicle with up to six passengers as well.
849582,Burtess,2014-04-23 11:09:00,901,"Yep, my pass for HRCA is for a full vehicle as well and it is a swipe card.  This is nice as you can use it with any vehicle you are in at the time.  I know the GRCA pass is a sticker for each specific vehicle which kind of sucks imo....  Burt"
849601,porkpie,2014-04-23 12:55:00,2521,GRCA has instituted a season pass valid for up to 6 people.  I don't believe it is vehicle specific anymore.  I will find out shortly when I go to buy my pass and launch pass!
849690,mcdougy,2014-04-23 22:10:00,274,Thanks fellas that was the answer I was looking for the vehicle pass is $100 and the boat is another $100 it appears. I was hoping those would be the final costs and not have to pay for each person as well.
849755,Pguzik,2014-04-24 03:33:00,34,Porkpie...... Got my GRCA pass a few weeks ago and it will be a CardSwipe starting at Shadesmills this summer as the trial location. Then hopefully it will be all of GRCA No more window stickers
