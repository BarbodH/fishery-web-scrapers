849314,Big Cliff,2014-04-22 10:35:00,6899,This rain should help to get rid of the ice pretty quick.
849357,Sinker,2014-04-22 15:22:00,8692,"We need wind, not rain. Lots of wind...different direction every day would be sweet.  S."
849441,Big Cliff,2014-04-22 20:48:00,6899,Well my friend I think you just got your wish. The wind today has cleared Goose Bay of ice. Might be able to do some fishing by the weekend. There is still plenty of ice in the main body of the lake but it is more slush than ice.

849596,Big Cliff,2014-04-23 12:13:00,6899,"Sturgeon Lake got close to but not up to the highest levels last year but they have dropped back a good 3-4"" now."
