Unfortunately the local dealer does not have any in stock so I'm unable to go and check one out, confirm the exact dimensions (for my garage storage), and of course get out for a ride once the ice is out.I live in North Bay ON and wanted to reach out to the community to see if anyone local (even within an hour drive of so) who owns this model or a similar one, and would be willing to show me their rig and let me know what they think of it (maybe even consider taking me out for a ride when the ice is out).I don't want to order one and find it doesn't fit in my garage, or I simply don't like it. I have rode in a similar model so I do have an idea and it fits everything I'm looking for in a boat, but I want to be sure.Josh"

849671,Maverick,2014-04-23 20:17:00,371,Welcome to the board! Did you check the website for dimensions? I have ridden(sp) in a few Tritons and they are a nice machine. Good luck with your purchase.
