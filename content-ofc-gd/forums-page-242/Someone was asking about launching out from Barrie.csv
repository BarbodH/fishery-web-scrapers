847400,misfish,2014-04-12 21:25:00,29133,Maybe in May.  
847401,Terry,2014-04-12 21:28:00,14456,but can I launch my skidoo
847467,irishfield,2014-04-13 03:23:00,26272,The Narrows at 9am this morning.. and the bay the launch is in..
847471,Joey,2014-04-13 04:41:00,9122,"Ahhh, just bring some salt and you're good to go"
847479,Fish Farmer,2014-04-13 11:09:00,2234,"I'll be out there in my boat very soon, even if I have to chisel my way out. Perch Festival starts on the 19th. Got 3 rooms booked."
847481,Terry,2014-04-13 11:20:00,14456,I hear blue beacon ramp is open @ 20 bucks a pop
847487,Fish Farmer,2014-04-13 12:05:00,2234,"Thanks Terry. Guys are saying if they charge $20 to launch they won't be going. We might have to wait for the public ramp to open up. We bring 3 boats for 4 days, so 60 a day is a little much."
847499,dracokaos,2014-04-13 13:01:00,116,I wonder how hard it would be to fish from a hovercraft???
847505,lew,2014-04-13 13:20:00,12766,"Guys are saying if they charge $20 to launch they won't be going.  Just curious as the what you call a fair price to launch Dave.  The private launches I use around the Kawarthas are $15 total  in & out including parking for the day and I always thought that was decent, specially if they have a well maintained ramp & docks."
847510,Sinker,2014-04-13 13:38:00,8692,"I wont pay more than $10 to launch anywhere. I mean really....how much maintenance is there on a concrete ramp? Most of them dont even have a garbage can, let alone a crapper.  Launch fees drive me crazy. Someone pockets the money, and does nothing for it.  S."
847513,Sinker,2014-04-13 13:45:00,8692,How come I dont see anyone fishing there thru that ice?  S.
847534,Fish Farmer,2014-04-13 16:07:00,2234,"""Just curious as the what you call a fair price to launch Dave.

Something wrong with the quote Lew can't quote at my end I've PM'd Roy and I don't think he's getting my PM. 10.00 dollars is lots Lew when you fish 2,3,4,times a week. Over $10 I think were being gouged and held at bay fishing waters that we pay for stocking and license's. Most is politics, these marinas close public launches to force us fisherman to fill their pockets. What we need Lew, is more public launches."
847536,crappieperchhunter,2014-04-13 16:22:00,2582,I rarely pay to launch....definitely  less then 10 times in my life ever. But I have no problem with a land owner charging whatever they want to charge for use of there shoreline. Waterfront property is expensive and so are there taxes and pretty much any marina is strictly a seasonal business...so they gotta do what they gotta do. Absolutely ALL the waters I fish have free public access. So from my point of view more public launches are a non issue and I'd prefer my tax dollars not to be spent on more of them.
847911,wormdunker,2014-04-14 23:11:00,1711,"I have no problem paying 10 or 15 bux to launch & park for the day.  I was at a launch on Georgian Bay a few years back (no identity), $7.00 to launch, $7.00 to haul out.  It gets better!  $7.00 to park my truck, oh you have a trailer to park for the day that's an additional 7 bux.  Total for the day $28.00!  I've been there twice.  The first & the last! LOL!"
847920,kickingfrog,2014-04-14 23:55:00,8333,This was today right at the Tiffin Boat launch.  http://www.thebarrieexaminer.com/2014/04/14/georgian-students-test-their-skills-in-barrie
847924,Terry,2014-04-15 00:33:00,14456,"yeah I watched them playing on the ice, in the water and the only thing I could think was  would they be pissed if I made a few casts into the open water beside them"
847938,irishfield,2014-04-15 01:39:00,26272,Maybe if they keep jumping around they'll speed up open waters arrival !
847979,misfish,2014-04-15 10:00:00,29133,"Seen them there as well. Tried to launch my tube, but they had the launch blocked.  Terry, I tried some open spots at the marina after work. Nada. Ice is moving out,bit by bit."
848485,kickingfrog,2014-04-17 18:17:00,8333,"For what is worth, the spots that the rescue guys (and gals?) were using the last few days were frozen over today at 1pm."
848776,misfish,2014-04-19 08:30:00,29133,"As of yesterday,you still aint getting out.  "
848790,kickingfrog,2014-04-19 12:06:00,8333,"I heard that one of those hovercrafts start at about $40,000."
849411,kickingfrog,2014-04-22 19:09:00,8333,Tiffen boat launch.      Barrie marina dock area is open but not the ramp.  North shore by hooters also open.
