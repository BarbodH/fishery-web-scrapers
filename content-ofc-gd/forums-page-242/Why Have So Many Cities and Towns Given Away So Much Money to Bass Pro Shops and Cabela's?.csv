I shop mainly at my local (well, closest anyway) tackle shop, but I don't mind scoring deals when they come up, and Canadian Tire has been good to me! i wait for their tools to go 70% off before i walk into CTC then i walk around. but it makes one think,if they are selling items at 70% off and still make a profit,thats some mark up they got."
849993,aplumma,2014-04-25 12:35:00,6896,Some times item are deeply discounted below their cost that the store paid for them. The inventory system takes into account how long it has been on the shelf and how many have been sold in a set time of reference. If it is below that number it is discounted and in some cases thrown out. The store has a specific amount of money that they are allowed to keep in inventory so if it is full of slow moving stock then they do not meet there sales numbers. Some of this stock is grouped together and sold in lots and this is how you see product on discount websites that are being sold for less than what they are worth.   Art
850056,JoshS,2014-04-25 18:47:00,729,"CT for the sale or clearance items only. Smaller guys for whatever I need that's the right price... I always order rods/reels from Bill's in Hamilton. There's lots of smaller shops out there that specialize in gear for certain bodies of water or species that are helpful. Box stores might get 30-50% of my business these days, mainly cuz of availability, location and the convenience. But I give my business to the little guys first if it makes sense... can't imagine the hit they take now with the emergence of these corporate stores!"

I always thought this was odd given the fishing opportunities. I suppose people buy their gear closer to home.  I wonder if this competition style will drop prices over what small shops could do.  I'd have to factor in the cost of gas and the aggravation of being far away. Not sure if the consumer is winning.

If I want to go have some tackle chat I head out to Bridgenorth tackle and talk with Frank. I give him my business because I like to support local businesses, but its a real head scratcher than we cant support at least one decent fishing store in town.

849678,misfish,2014-04-23 20:45:00,29133,"Wal mart contracts out for their fishing and hunting stuff. Guy comes in ,loads the shelfs and sets the price. I know this as I have asked when products would be in. They say,they dont know,they dont stock the area.  As for CTC. I have noticed that the south end store has revamped again. They were all gong hoo 2 years ago with making the hunting and fishing area pretty big. Still way over priced. Since the announcement of Cabelas coming to town, I have noticed they have started to down size their selection again.   CTC see very little of my hard earned dollars these days. Stupid crazy prices. I will agree that Sails prices seem to be the best of all the big chains. Lets see what Cabelas Barrie,brings to the table.  If both stores are willing to price match,Im going to be playing that game as they are both 2 minutes apart and only a 10 minute drive from my from my front door. Depending on traffic of course.LOL"

849687,outllaw,2014-04-23 21:33:00,1232,"Davey boy very true. problem is only part time wages paid. canadien store owners are normally,hands on operaters. the mart brothers are stocked by.

At least our local Canadian Tire has upped their game with an expansion and bigger outdoor section that now includes a good hunting and firearms selection as well as a good fishing section."
849729,OhioFisherman,2014-04-24 01:34:00,6623,"I remember the days of tax breaks for corporations here, they also brought city income taxes to the cities providing them.  Hmmm...

At least you can communicate & fish talk with the little guys.  Why, because they know fishing.   I love Grimsby Tackle, Pete's tackle in St. Catharines & Fishing world in Hamilton.  Cabelas in Barrie - I'll probably never see it unless you send me a picture!"
849771,mike rousseau,2014-04-24 09:00:00,4661,Not 100% true... For the most part I believe that's accurate... But some stuff is regular walmart inventory that is replenished... Like some rods and Plano boxes for example....    On the OP...  I support customer service and reasonable prices...  For me that's cabelas .COM and gander mountain... They've been amazing to me over the years...  The only local tackle store that gets my business is the Canadian carp club shop.... Great selection and friendly service... And a bit of walmart and CT if I only need 1-2 things ASAP....

I usually have already seen the product so now it is more about the price and availability than anything else. I guess this line of though came about trying to find parts for vintage motorcycles and cars and it has given me such good results it has carried over into the fishing world also.   Art

I want for a power handle for one of my Shimano musky reels and have called several shops around southern Ontario and even the States. Nobody has them in stock but everyone can order it for me. Price is in the $50 range plus tax plus $20-$25 shipping.  I'm only about 25 miles north of Shimano in Peterboro and decided to call them. They get them from their California office and it'll only cost me $40 plus $6 to ship it all the way up here.  Not a huge difference money wise, but it's better in my pocket that someone elses."
