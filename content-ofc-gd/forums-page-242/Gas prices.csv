Also the real price of diesel should be significantly below the gasoline cause is cheaper to produce...the way it used to be up until a few years ago until monster oil companies figured that they're loosing big money cause turbo diesel engine technologie has rapidly advanced and ppl tend to buy diesel cars being so much more economical and still performant...  ask yourself a question...why all American and Asian car manufacturers sell diesel engine cars all over the world except North America ??? ...to me, the only logical asnwer is political...the idiots in Texas said NOOOO  :D"

The plants right now while the plant is down are repairing the damage that the cold winter did to the equipment this winter. Our two most Northern plants had more damage done than the Southern plants and are still off line. This is why we get a bump in the spring and fall because we do not have enough places and equipment to produce the refined products that we all use.  Art

It's not very often (never?) that someone gets better MPG than the manufacturers claim...  Ramtruck.ca lists the following for comparable 2014's:  HFE 4x4 - Up to 25 mpg (11.4 L/100 km) City and 36 mpg (7.8 L/100 km) Highway Non-HFE 4x4 - Up to 22 mpg (13.0 L/100 km) City and 33 mpg (8.5 L/100 km) Highway Non-HFE 2x4 - Up to 23 mpg (12.4 L/100 km) City and 35 mpg (8.0 L/100 km) Highway   I guess it's time to contact Ram and let them know that their inflated numbers are actually too low....    As for the ride height, a higher vehicle has more drag due to more are volume passing under the vehicles uneven undercarriage. This is why the Ram's with air suspension lower themselves when driving with the Aero mode.  I have the 4x4 Non HFE and I am getting at or slightly better than what they say in all conditions. This is much better than what I have seen from previous chryco vehicles. Almost all of them I used to get far worse.  Up to 22 mpg (13.0 L/100 km) City and 33 mpg (8.5 L/100 km) Highway  I seem to be averaging as I mentioned between 9.5 and 10.5  combined.

Just a couple examples: Gas jumping up 30 cents a gallon over night when years ago gas being 30 cents a gallon would jump 1/2 a cent. To carry a house,kids going to school, upkeep, car, food, etc. You and Wife both working and still can't keep up then our government tells you to save for a pension. Some may be able to, but most can't any more. Our government then turns around and says they want more out of your pocket when the company that you working for wants concessions. We are running a race to the edge of the cliff. Technology is moving to fast, things are out of date before you buy. I sit sometimes out fishing thinking about what is happening and it's scary. I have 11 grandkids, I think will they ever afford to retire. I'm on my way out, maybe that's a good thing for me. I don't think this generation can cope a depression.

Being a hunter, an fisherman and outdoors guy, I don't think I can drive a car, so this truck has been awesome for me. Of course, many people have it in for Dodge so I know its not for everyone.

I would say about 100 km's of my two week window are spent cruising at 100-110. The rest is far below. For gas I fill up part way into my two week trip at the same gas station.

It will be enough to raise the eye brows of even the most diehard ford and bowtie folk. It will be really interesting to see how that thing does."
847809,Squid,2014-04-14 17:25:00,1656,Same here Wayne. On my 4/8 cyl Sierra I get between 8.5 and 11KM/100 when doing less than 110. I have noticed a huge difference round trip to st.clair and back. The Yukon was a 5.8 litre V8 which gave me good mileage under 110KM. This new beats it hands down. I guess that the the only way for all of to impact the oil companies is by everyone backing off and doing 100 KM on the highways. Not only will the gas inventories shoot upwards in a rapid fashion but our insurance rates would eventually go down due to less accidents. ( I can dream NO??)
847811,jedimaster,2014-04-14 17:35:00,3472,Being light on the gas truly makes a huge difference. 110 compared to 100 is huge in my truck even though it gets great mileage as it is.

847826,ch312,2014-04-14 19:09:00,1590,"25MPG US in the city?  I find that extremely hard to believe.   Are you actually hand calculating this or going by what the MFA tells you?  I just spent 5 minutes on Google and can't find a single case where anyone with a comparable truck is getting MPG even close to his claims driving strictly highway with a 2x4, let alone a 4x4 in the city. It's not very often (never?) that someone gets better MPG than the manufacturers claim...  Ramtruck.ca lists the following for comparable 2014's:  HFE 4x4 - Up to 25 mpg (11.4 L/100 km) City and 36 mpg (7.8 L/100 km) Highway Non-HFE 4x4 - Up to 22 mpg (13.0 L/100 km) City and 33 mpg (8.5 L/100 km) Highway Non-HFE 2x4 - Up to 23 mpg (12.4 L/100 km) City and 35 mpg (8.0 L/100 km) Highway   I guess it's time to contact Ram and let them know that their inflated numbers are actually too low....    As for the ride height, a higher vehicle has more drag due to more are volume passing under the vehicles uneven undercarriage. This is why the Ram's with air suspension lower themselves when driving with the Aero mode."

There are lots of things that really "" grind my gears"" about how we as nation conduct business. I love my country unconditionally but there are areas where we as tax paying citizens are getting the shorter end of the stick and it really gets me going. We live in such a resource enriched country, it would be nice to see us become a little more self sustaining providing Canadians with affordable solutions to various things and then after that, have our surplus shipped out of country.

If you get a bit heavy it won't get into 8th or will seek a lot. If I keep it down to 105 I will easily get about 7-8 l/100km's  not towing. I have a 20 foot travel trailer I tow with it and when I did it was fine on the highway, I seem to recall it getting about 15 l/100 from London to Toronto. My jeep used to get that empty. haha. I sold my boat last year but with my 16 foot lund I didn't notice any real difference in towing fuel economy. When I towed a few peoples 20' bass boats I was down to about the 14-16 mark.  Of course hills, traffic and how heavy you are with this truck makes a big difference. if you are light on the gas, accelerate slow, coast when its safe you will get great mileage. If you rip around with you foot down its gonna eat the gas like any heavy 300hp vehicle would."
