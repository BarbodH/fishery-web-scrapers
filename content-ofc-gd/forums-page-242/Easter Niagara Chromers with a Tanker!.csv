The fishing was good on the lower drifts, and I caught an absolute tank of a steelhead! We had such an enjoyable day drifting the peaceful waters that meander through the lower stretches of the Niagara River. We made it above the power dams briefly and caught a couple fish, but it was very busy with boats and gin clear water. The water temperature is still only 33.6F! That is the coldest I can remember for this time of year. There is still a lot of ice in the eastern basin of Lake Erie, and the ice boom is still in place to block major ice from flowing down the Niagara River. The boom is typically removed in mid-March, but this year it will be in place until May. That is the latest I have ever heard of since I've been fishing the Niagara."

849758,pidge,2014-04-24 03:49:00,438,"Geeze those are some big ol fish. Not sure which ones the tank as they all look huge to me, very nice job. I visited that area a few months ago with the girlfriend....just out for a drive and that gorge is some deep. Good on you guys for gettin out."
849763,Joey,2014-04-24 04:15:00,9122,"Sweet, not much ice coming down by the looks of it.  I figured there be more bergs after the winter we had.  Great stuff Aaron.  Another great report."

849803,TDunn,2014-04-24 12:59:00,680,Some really nice fish man! Doesn't help my soft water itch! Thanks for another great report  TDunn
849965,Aaron Shirley,2014-04-25 06:09:00,655,"Thanks everyone. The Niagara has been good. I love that river!  Gallie, I didn't put a scale to the fish, but now I wish I had. It was a really heavy fish. I was shocked how heavy it was when I picked it up. I was also equally surprised how thick the fish was. I had a hard time putting my hand on the caudal penduncle it was so thick. It was a big, thick fat steelie full of eggs. That is why I released it so quickly without a weight. I should have put it in the livewell to let it rejuvenate then weigh it and release. It was the biggest steelie I have caught in years. I originally guessed it at around 15lbs, but I think it was heavier."
