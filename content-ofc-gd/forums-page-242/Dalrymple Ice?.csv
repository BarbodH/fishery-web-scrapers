847135,Toddyc20,2014-04-11 01:24:00,141,Anyone know how dalrymple is looking? I love getting out there for early season pike so I'm curious as to how long until we have open water.
847139,chris.brock,2014-04-11 01:31:00,4053," a lot of us use  http://coastwatch.glerl.noaa.gov/modis/region_map.html  if the sky is clear, you can watch the ice come in the fall, and go in the spring"
847289,Toddyc20,2014-04-11 23:41:00,141,I've taken a look but can't really make out how the lake is. Thanks for the link though. Has anyone actually seen dalrymple recently?
847346,EC1,2014-04-12 15:48:00,930,"Pretty sure most lakes are in bad shape if you plan on walking on them, and unless the spot you want to go to has current ripping through it, you're a week or two away, depending on the forecast."
847398,Toddyc20,2014-04-12 21:17:00,141,"Thanks, I figured it would be the last weekend in April at best."
849812,Toddyc20,2014-04-24 13:33:00,141,Any updated info on the ice and water level on dalrymple? I would like to get out there this weekend but don't want to drive over 1 hour and not be able to get out.
849814,jimmer,2014-04-24 13:42:00,2730,"I drove over the bridge at the narrows on Easter Sunday. The water is high. I saw a couple of boats in the narrows, but it looked like the lake was still iced over. It might have broken up by now because other lakes that I have seen since then are open."
849824,BillM,2014-04-24 14:10:00,17367,Modis imagery doesn't show a lot of ice.
849856,big guy,2014-04-24 16:57:00,414,"Balsam, Sturgeon, Cameron, Mitchell and Canal are all open, so Dalrymple likely is as well"
849937,Toddyc20,2014-04-25 00:51:00,141,Thank you all for the updates. What is the best launch in Mitchell for someone coming from the orangeville area?
850067,jimmer,2014-04-25 19:14:00,2730,Right at the bridge on 48.
