848941,GBW,2014-04-20 04:10:00,8460,SAIL has worms as well as the store you mentioned.  Now will they be open on Easter Sunday when you are there is a whole different can of worms...
848944,redpearl99,2014-04-20 04:22:00,259,gagnon will be open so as long as they sell worms I should be good.  Thanks
848991,dracokaos,2014-04-20 15:53:00,116,Some gas stations and corner stores have a little fridge in them that have been supplied from Port Perry. They have worms. I know the Pioneer on Dundas just west of Thickson has one of those fridges.
848992,Fisherpete,2014-04-20 15:56:00,1814,How many do you need? I have a good supply that my son picked the other night - you can have some if you like. I'm in Whitby - just send me a PM.  Pete

Pete wow.  picking worms?  We're three weeks away at least from that.  My outdoor rink board are still frozen surrounded by snow.
849430,Fisherpete,2014-04-22 20:03:00,1814,"Yup, been getting them pretty good for about a week and a half now... tonight should be pretty good too with today's rain and mild temps."

849437,Dara,2014-04-22 20:33:00,3052,"wow.  picking worms?  We're three weeks away at least from that.  My outdoor rink board are still frozen surrounded by snow.   best time for worms in this neck of the woods is just when the snow is leaving.  If its a warm night, take a look...I have picked 10 dozen in a half hour when there was still a bit of snow around"
