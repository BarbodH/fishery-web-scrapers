33290,Matt15,2007-02-11 17:05:00,107,I found a daiwa procaster PM33SH and I took it apart but didnt know what I was doing and when I put it back together it had more problems then before. I'm wondering if it is worth it to get it fixed. I would like to get some opinions on this reel and if its worth fixing. Thanks   Matt

More than that, and I'd just put the money toward another real, possibly even the same one if you want.  At least then you'll have a bunch of spare parts for when you do figure out what you're doing (don't worry, I've been in your shoes before).  And you will also have a spare spool, which can come in handy."
