33381,dheitzner,2007-02-11 23:40:00,314,"great report as usual CC, i'm heading up to callandar bay on the 1st of march(reschedule from jan 4) so i'm pretty excited. could that the ""whitie"" that you caught actually be a lake herring?  i think that whitefish have a more pronounced overhung upper lip and usually kind of a hump on their back.  just asking because on the bay last year (and on simcoe too actually) we got into a whack of herring. can't wait untill your next chrome report. darcy"
33384,bucktail,2007-02-11 23:52:00,1857,I am pretty sure the Whitey is a Lake Herring as well..pointed nose and no underslung jaw. Wish I had been out thanks for the report.
33385,canadian_copper,2007-02-11 23:53:00,925,TX GUYS!! I DIDNT KNOW IF IT WAS A HERRING OR A WHITIE!!! ASKED A KID WORKIN THERE AND HE SAID WHITIE !!! ANY INPUT FROM EXPERIENCED GUYS??
33386,Greencoachdog,2007-02-11 23:55:00,8163,"Yup! That ""whitie"" is actually a blood thirsty killer Tullibee. I made the same mistake when I caught my first one too. Great report and pics!!!"

33430,Lowe Rider,2007-02-12 02:06:00,79,"Well I'd like to start by saying thanks a million Scott for having me along. To bad my bad luck followed us up there. So I guess you won the friendly bet on what the heck you caught. I second you on Snowfari, the owners where great as where the bungalows. To bad the fish only came buy from one to three o'clock in the afternoon! I don't think I could ice fish any other way now, sitting in a track suit, lying down with a fishing rod in one hand and a cool beverage in the other. The only thing missing was a shower and I think the one I had this afternoon at home was the best one ever!  Chris.  P.S. A thank you to my wife for making sure we had enough food so we didn't starve to death."
33431,Smokey,2007-02-12 02:10:00,1278,Great report Copper looks like a fun time out on the ice. Thanks

33461,Joey,2007-02-12 04:25:00,9122,"Great report Scott.  Ya, what's with the towel  And correct me if I'm wrong anyone, but I think that is a cisco, if its in Nippissing!  Joey"

33557,DanTheMan,2007-02-12 15:20:00,257,"Great report and pics  Scott.  Too bad about the fishing.Nippising can be a tough go lots of times.I see MANY post from other boards also, that the fishing was slow.and plp catching little to nothing.  Thats why this year,I am going to Abbitibi, im hoping that the fishign will be better   Anyway,  Love the report bud, good to see you fishing in a hut then along the riverside"
