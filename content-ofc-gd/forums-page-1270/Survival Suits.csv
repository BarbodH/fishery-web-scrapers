34428,DMASSE,2007-02-14 12:42:00,420,Hello  Over the recent month I have noticed that my Atlantic Class survival suit is starting to get really dirty from lying on the ice and fishing in general.  I was wondering if there was a cleaning solution or cleaning instructions that is needed to be followed..  Any help is appreciated  Dave
