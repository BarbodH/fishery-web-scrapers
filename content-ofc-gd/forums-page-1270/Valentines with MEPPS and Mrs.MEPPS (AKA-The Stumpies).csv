I already have enough problems with the oriface's God gave me! I can only immagine the grief I would be in for, if I messed with what the ""all-mighty"" has already given me! HH"

34084,snag,2007-02-13 18:07:00,1932,"Here's the deal,  I met up with Clive (AKA- MEPPS, or Mr.Stumpy) to go fishing the other day.    I have to say that I started getting annoyed with him.  He kept complaining that his missing finger is sensitive to the cold.  As well, he dropped a few things because of his missing digit.  Gillian keeps whining that she misses playing the piano, trumpet and trombone.  Don't get me wrong, I'm a romantic, Clive and Gillian are great,  But what they did was crazy.  For some of you newer members, here is the story.  I'll warn you, it's graphic.  http://www.bmezine.com/news/pubring/20050401.html    printed 01/04/05  I am a pretty tolerant guy, but I have to say that this ""act of love"" has hurt our relationship.  I hope nobody else gets this crazy  Anyways, Happy Valentines Day!"

""wow.. wierd but normal dude...""  That was when he had the hoops in his ears... which being a northern hick like redneck  I thought was pretty cool...  Now would I bite my finger off for my wife... not likely now that we are married.. lol .... would i get it bitten off in her defense... absoultley...  as far as Im concerned.. in your own mind, maybe there is/was no difference...  Clive...  If I was gonna do it though... I would have shot it off..."
