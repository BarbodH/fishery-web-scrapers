She couldn't even stand on them at first, but after a short 2 hours, she was skating on her own...without a chair!  I am so proud of her.  If you watch the video, the last minute shows a bunch of her falls, and it ends with her skating towards me...striding....and not ""walking"" on her skates.   <object width=""425"" height=""350""><param name=""movie"" value=""    <BR><BR>   This is a place of firsts for her. It is also the place she caught her first fish. :-)     "
33601,lunkerbasshunter,2007-02-12 18:28:00,2585,man that is so awesome!  TO see her get better must have been such a trill!  Thanks for sharing the video!  Cheers!
33606,1leggedangler,2007-02-12 18:57:00,364,"Congrats! Looks like a wonderful time. From one pround Dad to another!  Cheers, 1leg"
33628,RobHall,2007-02-12 19:20:00,261,"Thanks for sharing.  The ""Learning how to Skate"" video of you daughter was awesome.  The pic of your daughter and her first fish is priceless too.  The smile says it all.  FOTB "
33632,bigfish1965,2007-02-12 19:27:00,3382,Amazing stuff cliff! I used to teach kids her age to skate and the hardest thing to get them to do is not 'walk' on the skates. To learn that in just two hours is very impressive. Maybe a future Canadian Olympic Hockey player!
33636,ccmtcanada,2007-02-12 19:35:00,7971," Thanks Rick...probably helps that we've been practising ""striding"" on the hardwood floors in our house for a few weeks now with our socks on...haha."
33637,Roy,2007-02-12 19:38:00,13728,Really nice Cliff. Isn't it amazing how they just get right back up there. It looks so simple but I dare any of you who know how to skate to try it with a lawn chair in front of you.
33763,ccmtcanada,2007-02-12 23:51:00,7971,Thanks everyone!  We are very proud of her...and she CANT wait to get back out there.
33799,JEREMY,2007-02-13 00:43:00,300,She is allready doing better than half of our friday night pick up guys.
33835,Clampet,2007-02-13 01:25:00,1947,"Cliff and Carole, Watching your excellent vid of your little sweetheart was quite heartwarming. Isn't that an allegory (?) to life itself.  Some of us, me included are constantly falling down, and have to pick ourselves up and as the song says, ""Get back in the race again"" (Red Rider). Your daughter is blessed to have such wonderfull caring and smart parents as youselves. I predict she will have a bright and successful future ahead of her."
34056,Hookset,2007-02-13 17:10:00,367,"Thats's very cool CCMT. It brings back a ton of memories. One of the earliest things I can remember is my Dad teaching me to skate at the same age, using the old chair method too. I will never forget the proud look on his face and the laughs we had while I learned. Unfortunately I lost my Pop to cancer just about a month ago. Seeing your video put a smile on my face. Your kids may be young but I bet they will remember the special times like that. It's all worth it..............  Thanks again.  Hookset"
