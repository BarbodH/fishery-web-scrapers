Nipissing is a large lake and it may depend on the species you are looking for where you may want to go. Fishing on Nipissing for the first time you may want to enlist the services of a ice fishing hut rental and guide to give yourself a better understanding of the area. If you are an experienced ice fisherman there are many places to go. I am experienced on the south east end of the lake but know little of the west end. Walleye, Perch and Pike are most sought after in winter."
