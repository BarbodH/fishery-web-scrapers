34138,Clampet,2007-02-13 19:21:00,1947,That should be a successful fishing trip. Really looking forward to your report upon your return.
34142,brickNblock,2007-02-13 19:26:00,598,"FinS........ Awesome trip indeed thar bud! Fishing with family........ Fishing with fellow OFC'rs...... Fishing with friends.........All awesome... some times the best fishing is done alone though.........no distractions, complete concentration.......having an extra is a neccessity at times(net man, boat navigator, safety in pairs etc...) What is it that M.Thorpe says...'Leave your smiles on shore'..and Lew once said...'Only thing I want to hear from a boat partner is...Get The Net' But fishing alone is one of my favs.... Fishing anytime is great.. Looking forward to your report... Be safe and best of luck to you. Peter"
