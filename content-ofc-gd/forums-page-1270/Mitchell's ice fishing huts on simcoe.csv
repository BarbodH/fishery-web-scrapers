34301,ryanheritage,2007-02-14 00:59:00,180,I was wondering if anyone knows if anything is being caught at Mitchells ice fishing huts ? On simcoe out from beaverton and if anyone knows what kind of jigs or bait is hot right now?
34320,Gerritt,2007-02-14 01:37:00,6129,"bookoobeast... it is customary here on OFC to introduce yourself, tell us a little about youself... then ask for fishing advice...  Just an FYI if you want to get the info your looking for.   BTW welcome to OFC!! the wickedest whackiest fishing forum around.  Gerritt."
34340,ryanheritage,2007-02-14 02:54:00,180,"Ok i thought all that info was in my profile. But here i go I am just a guy that does some fishing on weekends mostly at my cottage on bobs lake north of kingston. Don't really get a chance to go more places cause don't ever have luck anywere else. I love to fish it s the only time I get to do nothing but enjoy life. I rented a hut on simcoe for sunday and my friend and i are going for his first time for whitefish and my 2ncd time. Don't know alot about it except for what i read in ontario outdoors so I was hoping to get some local advice or advice from people who catch more then colds. I am a catch and release advocate, and I just enjoy being out their on the water."

Get 'er down to a foot off bottom.  Other than that, most operators will supply you with minnows, the preferred bait of most Simcoe guys.  Good luck, and let us know how you made out."
34364,FishFinder,2007-02-14 03:49:00,481,A spreader with minnows on bottom should work just fine
34365,Mike Pike,2007-02-14 03:53:00,1332,"Oh yea.. sorry Beast.  My presentation recommendation is for perch, of course.  Don't know if you were planning on fishing for perch with Mitchel's or if they go deep for lakers and whities."
