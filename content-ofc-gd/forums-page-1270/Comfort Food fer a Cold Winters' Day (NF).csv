34163,douG,2007-02-13 20:00:00,2693,"Almost edzachary like my recipe.  I add three or four diced cloves of garlic, and a little crushed chili.  I also use salt reduced chicken broth rather than water.  I've tried maple syrup instead of the molasses, too.  Serve with fresh bread, cheese and pickles.  A good crisp ale rounds out the menu."
