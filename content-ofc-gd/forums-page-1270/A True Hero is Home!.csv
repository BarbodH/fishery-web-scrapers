I finally after 6 months talked to my brother-in-law tonight, he is now home! He sounds so happy and he is grateful to be home with his family. He cannot believe how big his new daughter has gotten since he went back to Afganhistan, he told me and he also wants to thank all of you for your support, thank you's and well wishes. His hard and brave work is going to be noticed, and I am very proud of him,  in April the family has to go to Ottawa, he is recieveing a medal of some sort I am not sure what it is for but only him and one other soldier is recieveing this medal!   He deserves this....he is a very great guy with a big heart and I could not have asked for a better brother-in-law. He has made this family VERY proud and I am very thankful to ALL of the troops who stood up for OUR country and OUR FREEDOM!  "

33922,Rich Clemens,2007-02-13 11:09:00,3131,Truly great news and please pass along our highest degree of gratitude for his service from us south of the border.  Most of us don't know what it's like over there and it takes a special kind of man or woman to do the work they do.  Give him our praise and thanks.
