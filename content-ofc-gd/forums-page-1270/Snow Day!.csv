34459,bigfish1965,2007-02-14 14:33:00,3382,For the first time EVER I am calling off work today due to snow. Got about 40 cm and drifting in places is well over a metre. Not driving in this crap for no one. Now I know I am old. Used to be a time when I loved driving in the nasty stuff.
34469,ecmilley,2007-02-14 14:45:00,2163,was gonna stay home as well then couldn't think of anything to do so went to work anyway
34470,fishdawg,2007-02-14 14:45:00,912,nearly the same amount here down the road from ya Rick - was supposed to be in Burlington today  ummmmm..... ya thats not happening
34472,Smokey,2007-02-14 14:48:00,1278,Enjoy the day at home Rick you probably need a break anyways.
34473,Terry,2007-02-14 14:48:00,14456,"yeah, way to nasty to go to work   but a fishing trip would be  OK"
34474,Whopper,2007-02-14 14:49:00,2174,Took the day off yesterday and to be honest with ya I would have rather been working instead of doing the snow removal thing.
34480,Joey,2007-02-14 14:55:00,9122,"Enjoy your day Rick!!!  I came to work and there's only one other person here.  The receptionist called in, then the other employees called in, then the BOSS called in.  Nobody else is coming.  Guess I'll stick it out til I get bored then leave  Joey"
34485,Garyv,2007-02-14 15:00:00,547,"We hardly got anything, maybe 10 to 15 Cm and lots of blowing snow.  It pays to be in Southwestern Ontario as were much closer to the Equator than you Hamilton, Toronto , Niagara people.   All done until later today here."
34498,Corey,2007-02-14 15:21:00,355,"I just spent 2 hours with the snowblower. I will be leaving for work shortly... 4' drift at the end of my driveway... took a little bit of time, but I snowblowed through it."
34505,Entropy,2007-02-14 15:39:00,747,"Near Port Perry we only got 8 to 12 cm by 6:30am this morning, Ajax has about the same right now."
34514,young_one,2007-02-14 16:16:00,620,"snow day  slept in... gonna organize my fishing tackles, and research on boats."
34517,LeXXington,2007-02-14 16:28:00,1928,I wanted to stay at home too but with my Wife and kid home I figured Work was a quieter place to go and read OFC
34523,xrap,2007-02-14 16:40:00,683,"Just finished doing most of the driveway and most spots were over 80cm and the mini hills  from the blowing snow were about 2 metre's. All done by shovel, I think my ams are gonna fall off when i do the rest"
34525,ccmtcanada,2007-02-14 16:43:00,7971,"I planned ahead...brought some work home and the boss was ok with that.  I have a 60km drive from the burbs to Toronto.  On a day like this it easily would have taken me 2.5 hours to get there....and 2.5 hours to get back.  I was going to take the GO train, but at 630am, they already were experiencing troubles and canceled a few trains.   Just checked back now and they are still canceling trains!  Glad I made the choice to stay home instead of spending about 5 hours on the road.  With the day off, I checked out local rink...about a 2 min drive from home.  They had a parent/tot public skate from 10 to 11 this morning, so I took my little one there.  It was great!  $4.50 for the hour....it was pretty much empty there....3 parents and 4 kids.  She had a blast, so it was all worth it."
