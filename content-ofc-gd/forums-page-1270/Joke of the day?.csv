She looked a little puzzled, but brought him a beer. When he finished it, he said, ""Quick, bring me another beer. It's gonna start."" This time she looked a little angry, but brought him a beer. When it was gone, he said, ""Quick, another beer, it's gonna start any second."" ""That's it!"" She blows her top, ""You dummy! You waltz in here, flop your fat self down, don't even say hello to me and then expect me to run around like your slave. Don't you realize that I cook and clean and wash and iron all day long?"" The husband sighed. ""Oh crap, it's started. __________________"
