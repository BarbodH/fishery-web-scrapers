34267,huntervasili,2007-02-13 23:40:00,1604,Hey all... This weather has caused many places to close down tonight as well as tomorrow morning... So before you head out somewhere you may want to call em to see if theyre open or even better stay home and avoid accidents... I know for those who may be wondering many schoolboards have closed there schools in both hamilton and halton... probably other places as well but just mentioning it to you... Everyone enjoy the weather but be careful out there...
