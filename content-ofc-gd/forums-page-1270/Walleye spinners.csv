34070,muskieb,2007-02-13 17:48:00,58,"Here is a picture of some of the walleye spinners I make.  This is about half the colours that I have available.  Just thought I would post an image to see how much interest there is in them, and if I should put an add up in the classifieds.  They are currently displayed without the hooks, but when complete they have a #4 baitholder hook and a wire stinger shaft with an aberdeen hook as a trailer.  I can post or email other pictures if anyone is interested.  "
34074,ccmtcanada,2007-02-13 17:55:00,7971,Wow!  Some beauties there!  I'd be interested and would love to see a post on the board...maybe in the classified section if they are for sale.
34085,muskieb,2007-02-13 18:07:00,58,"I am going to get a couple better pictures and add some text that is a little more legible, then I can put up a post in the classifieds for anyone who is interested.  Glad you like them."
34086,Castmaster,2007-02-13 18:08:00,86,That's all we use for lake trolling down here. Bottom bouncers and harnesses like those on a 2 foot leader. Deadly!!! Nice rigs. How much $$ for a nice selection say 2 of each?
34093,muskieb,2007-02-13 18:19:00,58,"I am assuming you are talking about trolling them in Erie?  I have always wanted to try them down there.  I also play around with some tandems for myself which I love, just they are a little costly when it comes to selling them to most anglers.  Oh and important to note, they are all #4 colorado blades.  What is shown in the picture is about half of the colours.  I also have solid colors, both in painted and metallics and a few other combinations.  As far as price is concerned....there are a couple stores selling them now and they go for about $3.29 each.  I can be a little flexible if you are looking for some volume.  Shoot me a PM if you are interested."
34096,fishindevil,2007-02-13 18:24:00,6254,"well done,they look really nice,and yes thats what i use for walleyes as well,and i make some of my own as well both with wire and mono good job,im sure they will catch fish.....cheers"
34243,FinS,2007-02-13 22:37:00,463,nice work but i like mine better always a proven fish catcher for me anyway 17lb trilene #4 eagle claw stealth hook  
34318,muskieb,2007-02-14 01:34:00,58,"Those are nice if you like spinners on mono.  I have had far too many bite offs in the past to pike and muskie so I switched to the wire to eliminate that problem.  A spinner on mono can at times provide an edge when the walleye are very finicky, as long as you are prepared to possibly lose the bigger fish to bite offs.  Either way your spinners look great too, I guess it comes down to what the fishermen enjoy themselves."
