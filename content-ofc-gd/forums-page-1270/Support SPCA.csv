I would also like to mention of anyone is seeking a loyal friend for the family have a look a the SPCA in your area or surrounding area.  We live in Cambridge but went to Barrie to rescue our little girl. Nothing like feeling great about giving a animal another chance and truly feeling like you made a differance.   Thanks again.  Ken "
