33991,aplumma,2007-02-13 14:34:00,6896,I guess I should click on more of them buttons all over this website. The news is the button that is on top in line with the many other features on the website. Thanks to all of the authors that take the time to contribute. I am guessing that if anyone finds something news worth they can submit it to one of the mods and they can run it thru legal to see if it can be included in future statements. Thanks for the time and another cool feature on this site.  Art

""Original"" and ""Blue Batter"" are my favs!  I also hope that Rock Masden could find a position with the new company because he's pretty much the face of the product, not to mention the inventor.  Sounds like he may have sold the business too soon."
