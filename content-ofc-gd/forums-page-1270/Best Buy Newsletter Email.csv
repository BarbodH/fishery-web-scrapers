There was an email from Best Buy last night concerning ""The Police"" who will be coming to Toronto in July to perform at the ACC.  There is a unique pre-sale password in the email which I am looking to get.  If anyone received this email and are not planning to use the password, would you mind sending it my way.  I would need this password ASAP as it has to be used today. Thanks guys, Tracker Terry"
33963,Fang,2007-02-13 13:40:00,1330,just an FYI as I get advance notice on ACC concerts through a program at my work  The tickets I have access to are $238 each.  Yikes!!!
33965,ccmtcanada,2007-02-13 13:42:00,7971,"$238 ?????????  Holy crap!!!  Come on....I love the Police, but there's no way I'm paying those kinds of prices.  I paid $100 for Eagles tickets on their Hell Freezes Over tour and thought that was excessive."
33967,Hellfish,2007-02-13 13:49:00,308,"Unfortuantly i will be paying full price, when the normal tickets go on sale. 2 Yrs ago i saw Sting play with Josh freese (a perfect circle drummer) and it was unbelieveable, sounded better than the Grammy performance thats 4 sure. B4 i went and saw them Sting had not played a Police tune in over 7yrs apparently and it was unbelieveable, they also played a day and a life by the beetles, good show."
