34069,Bigfish,2007-02-13 17:48:00,19,Here a pic from late December 2006 walleye fishing on The Bay! So how was the year for the walleye guy's? 
34083,Clampet,2007-02-13 18:06:00,1947,"Hi Frank. Nice Walleye, about how big in lbs? I personally have been avoiding BOQ, because I am a meat fisherman.  I've caught my share  of hogs and like to bring home the catch, and as you probably know, the big 'uns don't taste as good as the little fellers."
34089,Bigfish,2007-02-13 18:17:00,19,"That walleye was 14lbs, the biggest one of the year was 17lbs. There is some real hoggs in that lake! Clampet I am not much of a meat hunter myself, I much rather enjoy the fight of the fish and release them back into the lake. But those walleye sure do taste good! And not to mention the Perch and crappie they are my favorite! When's the fish fry?"
34098,fishindevil,2007-02-13 18:26:00,6254,thats a nice quinte hog ...WTG
34102,Fishnfiend,2007-02-13 18:31:00,357,I don't think that pickeral (walleye) fight as well as other sportfish.  Why don't you target pike/bass/trout/musky if you just want a good struggle?
34109,Steve,2007-02-13 18:50:00,2075,"now 17lbs, thats a good'in.  you wouldn't have a pic of it would ya? i've never seen a quinte fish that big. (unmounted)  biggest i saw pictured in the last few years is the 15 lbs'er posted on this page right now.....  what was the info on the biggin? length? girth?  musta been a beaut!"

34127,ccmtcanada,2007-02-13 19:08:00,7971,"Beauty Eye there!!! Here's my wife's PB (bly on the board)...this was a 31""x20.5"" 15 pounder.    Here's my PB....a 32"" x 19"", 14.5 pounder.   Both our PB's came from shore...throwing crank baits and using 8 to 10 pound mono line."
