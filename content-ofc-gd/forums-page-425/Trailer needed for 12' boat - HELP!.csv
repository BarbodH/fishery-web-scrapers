681430,ehg,2012-03-29 12:12:00,2666,Just went through the same search for 12 ft. boat trailer. Ended up getting decent galvanized trailer with trash 14 ft. fiberglass boat on it for 300 dollars. It was listed as 'wanted' luckily stumbled upon it. Some trailers were listed about 700 dollars but involved some travelling. Keep looking and try unlikely places something good will pop up.

681590,richyb,2012-03-29 16:46:00,774,What about looking for maybe a utility trailer or a single wide snowmobile trailer ? My buddy used one like that and it seemed to work fine for his 12 footer.
681591,tb4me,2012-03-29 16:50:00,3295,"im in the same boat here, pun intended..I have a trailer but it needs so much work that I think id be further ahead to just get a new one. Call around to all the local marinas and boat dealers..Not going to be cheap but they will have one for sure.. What about trailer parks with water frontage..They may have some for sale posted in the community centres or stores."
681601,Fish4Eyes,2012-03-29 17:18:00,1022,"Call all the marinas before you make a decision. I got a 14' EZ loader galvanized for $8XX with led lights while others were quoting 1200$+. Bought mine in Dundas, off Hwy 5."
681644,smally21,2012-03-29 19:05:00,993,seadoo trailers would fit that as well...more optioins out there.
681645,Nipfisher,2012-03-29 19:11:00,2449,There is a junker on kijiji North Bay for $125. Needs a bit of work but might do the trick?  http://northbay.kijiji.ca/c-cars-vehicles-boats-watercraft-powerboats-motorboats-Small-Boat-Trailer-W0QQAdIdZ366991996    There are alot of 4x8 utility trailers available as well.
681654,davey buoy,2012-03-29 19:45:00,5505,"That looks like a decent deal,maybe fix the lights,new cable?,probably get it for $100.00,pays part of your gas if you can do it."
681771,bigbuck,2012-03-29 23:56:00,2449,"Don't forget, you still have to get the junker home so it has to be relatively safe. The buy a boat for the trailer idea is probably your best bet."
