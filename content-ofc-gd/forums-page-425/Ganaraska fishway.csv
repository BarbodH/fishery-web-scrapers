680151,Hairpy,2012-03-26 14:14:00,73,"Paul , I don't ever see a roe ban happening around here. Fish eat eggs that's what they do so we use eggs for bait quite simple. At least there's a 2 fish limit on the river. A lot of people also use tonnes of flies , beads , pink worms etc and even ""crickhoppers"" lol! But they all have their time and place too. I use those items usually when I run out of roe."
680159,solopaddler,2012-03-26 14:31:00,8605,"     I find this amusing and sad. Lou I'm in your corner 100%.  There are many who likely don't know this, but Louis is heavily involved with CRAA and has given many hundreds of hours of time to the cause over the years.  Louis is also a dedicated steelhead fisherman who also happens to fish with roe.  Mr. Snyders comments are akin to a small brat of a boy poking a stick into a hornets nest just to see what might happen.  He obviously knows what Lou's contributions have been to the fishery, but that counts for nothing apparantly. Even in the face of the largest run of WILD steelhead on the Credit in years.  It's no wonder Louis snapped. It's a thankless job these guys do most of the time.  At the very least guys like Lou and Joseph (who's also heavily involved as well...thanks Joe!) deserve a pat on the back.  NOT some internet fool attacking them personally and spouting off their insane rhetoric."
680244,Hairpy,2012-03-26 18:09:00,73,"Thanks for the kind words Mike ! Yeah we keep inviting Snidley to come and help with the fish ladder , the hatchery , the boat launch, the tree planting and many other events but no he's too busy whinning from behind his computer  Joseph"

680494,BillM,2012-03-27 12:16:00,17367,Mike's probably got 400-500lbs of roe in the freezer by now according to some people in this thread   :rofl2:
680571,Sinker,2012-03-27 15:58:00,8692,"I just clued in that Snidley is Paul Snyder. I remember him spewing this crap back in the late 80's early 90's when metro east steelhead and salmon fisherman was just starting. I don't think he came out to any of our rehab jobs on duffins back then either. I can't remember his buddies name though....Burt? I forget, that was a long time ago, when there were more fish than fisherman! Duffins used to get a run of over 5000 fish back then, and the ganny was averaging around 10-12,000. The good ole days. I haven't fished the tribs seriously since the mid 90's, and I don't miss it one bit!!  Anyways....carry on....  S."
680616,Snidley,2012-03-27 17:47:00,620,"I have held my opinion on roe/ stocking for a long time but the '80's might be a stretch since I lived in BC for most of that decade. Certainly lots of people in BC held that opinion in the '80's, so much so that not only is roe and some cases even scent banned now but  killing Steelheads is not permitted. In fact all samonoids are highly protected in BC where ANNUAL limits of even stocked salmonoids is enforced with tags that must be filled out on retaining any salmon. User pays is enforced by making sure that salmon/steelhead anglers must buy the tag  or tags just to fish for these beauties. This is how sophisticated enforcement and management is paid for. My opinion on roe is now officially held in all of Canada except for Ontario. Some US states also now hold the same opinion on roe and US states virtually ALL have strong stocking programs for ALL of their gamefish. In addition New York state is winning the overall competition with pen rearing/ superior imprinting  drawing not only their own migratory fish back to their estuaries for their anglers but  drawing away fish from Ontario, Pennsylvania and Ohio as well. Ohio and Pennsylvania are not really suffering badly and they still have tons of fish because their stocking programs are so successful that they have what can only be described as an overabundance of trout to begin with. Ontario, not so much. We do have great tree lines in Ontario though. Thanks CRAA. I also remember lots of fish here, and not that long ago, all supported by stocking. I wonder what happened to them? Could it be that some guys married to a primitive tradition killed most them because they couldn't figure out a way to catch their ""numbers"" without using the future of the fishery for bait all the while throwing their support behind a government ministry and conservation club that opted for tree planting rather than more aggressive measures? And any bonus  option for pelagic enhancement... lets spend that $$ on a ""native"" fish that were here 150 years ago. A fish that would have to be stocked AND is about the is single most expensive fish possible to stock successfully. All brought to you by your friends at MNR,OFAH, CRAA and an Aussie winery. So we are now stocking...a fish that is the most expensive possible to stock successfully and with the least possible chance of success...unless you spend most of your money to do so...with continual stocking. Someone wrote a book about these kinds of situations, Catch 22 I believe it was called. Could it also be that these same guys are falling all over themselves over one run, on one river, in one year? A year with the warmest March on record that has created a push just when the anglers happen to be on stream. We shall see how this plays out over the next few years. The MNR has decided that mainly based on the ""success"" of the Atlantic program and the ""sustainable"" philosophy espoused by CRAA and their accolytes to open a larger single egg rearing hatchery that will house the sainted Atlantic, some steelhead and Chinnook salmon all in one facility. Essentially this is all eggs/one basket approach. This approach is also contrary to the way things are done on the west coast and in the US where multiple facilities hedging the risk of disease is considered prudent. I hope it does not happen but single large facilities housing the vast majority of your already minimal stocking options seems to me to be risky, but only if you believe that aggressive human intervention into a fishery that is mainly centered in an urban setting of 4 million people is a requirement. Hope I'm wrong but given ""sustainability"" as the over riding philosophy of your approach then not restricting bait options in one single case, spawn, seems to me to be ridiculous. If you decide you are married to fishing with eggs, and Ontario's authorities and most Ontario anglers are, then it seems to me that aggressive stocking tactics are required. Personally I suggest both sustainable practices including no roe but allowing other organics, no harvest at all in GTA or any other vulnerable watersheds combined with aggressive stocking (of optimal strain freshly harvested from wild fish not brood stock) would be best and would create a fishery like the US or Argentina, or BC. and would also insure the overall fishery from dramatic or even catastrophic downturns that need not exist but under current management are the norm."

680647,Snidley,2012-03-27 18:54:00,620,"Natural Lake O fish and stocked Lake O fish have virtually zero difference in fighting qualities. Fish energy levels/fighting characteristics are governeed by several factors. Temperature is one issue. Anyone who has fished the Niagara, where both natural and stocked fish are present, will understand that in April, May and June any steelhead you hook up with will rip exceptionally hard. In January, through March much less so. Same in Lake Erie. Virtually everyone from Ontario fishes the Catt in the middle of winter, in low flow (the Catt is virtually only fishable in low flow). Size of the fish is also a factor. Erie fish are smaller in  general but if anglers went out into the western Erie basin  in the summertime and hooked up with these same smaller fish they would find they fight with great ferocity, for their size. Water flow is also a factor. Our Ontario tribs,  especially the Credit, are fishable when there's lots of flow and flow is like wind at the back for the fish. Wind at the back of natural fish or stockers is going to present the impression of a strong fight. In the blue zone in the middle of summer there's a mixture of natural and stocked steelhead. To my mind they all fight exceptionally well and thanks to New York State and their aggressive stocking tactics there are lots of them to catch. Temperature, water flow, gear dynamics, year class distribution and strain genetics are the factors that govern the fighting qualities/energy levels of steelhead not whether they are stockers or natural. Cognitive dissonance, on the other hand, is the main determining factor in the entire argument surrounding this issue coming from the CRAA membership (an organization of which Joseph, Mike, Louis and possibly others in this post are members of)."
680649,esoxansteel,2012-03-27 19:04:00,1307,"  Thanx for the offer Mike but I as well hit the cleaning stations in August for that yummy salmon skein, just got a chuckle out of Bill's thread, and I thought id help take the distraction away from Snidely for a minute, but i guess the minutes now up"
680653,torco,2012-03-27 19:15:00,656,This debate does seem to have gone very personal but I can see some merit on both sides of the argument.  I am also not sure it is necessary to fish with roe anymore but I can definitely see some valid counter arguments so to lay blame entirely on guys that fish with roe is probably too simplistic.  In my mind and I am no fisheries management guru you need the following for sustainable fishery: -Good quality habit -Reasonable restrictions on fishing through limits and seasons  It sounds simple but is clearly not. So we need the CRAA and other groups to improve our waterways and we need the MNR to figure out what restrictions are needed. To me the first step is the reduction in limits from 5 to 2 on the Lake.

679794,BillM,2012-03-25 15:54:00,17367," Explain to us why the Notty's steelhead run has been getting stronger and stronger over the past few years.    No stocking, 100% wild self sustaining population of fish, no roe ban, no bait bans, no gear restrictions..  The only thing that has been done is HABITAT IMPROVEMENT and a No kill zone from Nicholston to Angus (This isn't spawning water either)  I'm eagerly awaiting your response."
679815,tb4me,2012-03-25 16:30:00,3295,bla bla bla guys..start a new thread to talk about this..This thread was and I repeat WAS about the Ganny Fishway..Looking for an update takes 5 min of sorting thru the balbber in here now.
679821,MJL,2012-03-25 16:46:00,2427, But there are no fish in the Notty   Definitely not the mass exodus of fish yesterday at the dam that we saw a few days prior...Just enough to take a few shots      
679823,Snidley,2012-03-25 16:46:00,620,"There's tons of stocking on Lake Huron and Georgian Bay. What do you think the clubs are doing with the Derby $$$. Trout are notorious wanderers in case you did not know and stocked fish repopulate all over the system including into and out of America. In addition there's been a reduced bag limit on Georgian Bay for a lot longer than on Lake O tribs. The no kill zone might also have an impact. Finally what is the population of Wasaga. Does that qualify as an urban fishery to you?   Hard to fathom how anyone can't appreciate how over harvest of edible animals can outstrip the natural environment's ability to replenish the lost stocks of biomass unless enhanced/influenced by man through human migration, animal husbandry or conservation. It is essentially the story of mankind after all. Maybe you missed that decade at school.  Still waiting?"
679825,BillM,2012-03-25 16:53:00,17367," Ah so now the Notty is nothing more then a river fill of stocked wanderers?  lol!   Of course the no kill zone has an impact, that's exactly my point.  That a long with stream rehab has done wonders for that river.  But according to you, that's impossible..  Habitat couldn't possibly play such an important role for the wild population of steelhead in that river.  At least your replies are good for a laugh, and for that I thank you!"

There was a comment about they dont spawn in the Notty (Bill,shame on you)LOL The stretch from ivy up to the bridge,has some great spawning grounds,and I have seem them paired up and spawning.  Lots of talk about wasting fish for roe. I have to say,what about the waste of roe to keep the fish from the charters. Like Mike said,he goes there to get his roe,and I know alot of roe is wasted in the trash.  I have a question and I have no idea. Can the roe from late season fish that is wasted,can it be scraped and used for the hatchery?   TY  Nice photos."
679848,BillM,2012-03-25 17:53:00,17367," I wouldn't really call that great spawning water, more like shallow spots in between pools, lol!  I would guess 99% of the fish in that river spawn in the Boyne, Pine and the upper river in Hockley (or further)  They should also make the Pine south of the base No Kill as well.  The slaughter that goes on there in the fall before the close is horrible."

679955,Snidley,2012-03-25 22:25:00,620,"I love when bait anglers talk about retention. When they kill fish for roe or meat it's a harvest, when anyone outside their circle kills a fish its' a slaughter. When that drippy Brown trout makes the bad decision to get caught on your hook what is it boys, conservation minded harvest or slaughter?  Trollers are just as bad especially with Salmon for ""the DERBY"". To them stream guys are snaggers  wasting  the fish for bait while the trollers purpose is noble, ie to get some cash and notoriety among their peers. Then chuck the carcass, or worse, feed it to some rubes that will eat it on the say so of ""expert"" fishermen that it's safe if you cut off the belly. Then there are the hoards that weigh in 15-25lb fish when the leader board was 32lb before they even left harbour that morning. I even remember seeing some ""Pro"" angler with a TV show suggest since Chinnooks are toxic that a great use for them would be to feed the carcasses to the bears at the zoo. Now that's conservation minded  I suppose on a cosmic basis it's funny and will amount to nothing in the long run but it sure is irritating in the mean time."

680042,Richard S.,2012-03-26 01:12:00,75," I can answer your question for you, roe if it is still skeen cannot be used because it is still immature and not ready. On the other hand loose roe once it leaves the female and touches water it has only a short period of time to be firtelized before it becomes useless.   Rich."
680043,Snidley,2012-03-26 01:16:00,620,"It was supposed to be 2 in the lake as well then at the very last minute it was changed to the current compromise of 2 in the river and 5 in the lake. Wonder if the ""Derby"" or OFAH or both had anything to do with it? But before stream anglers get cocky one of the other curiosities of our current regulations is that by Federal statute roe retained is in fact the same as fish retained. It's part of the fish after all, no different really than fins or fillets, and Federal law says it's all part of your limit. This came to me in an email from the head of enforcement from the MNR BUT when push comes to shove it is NEVER enforced. The reasons are twofold. One, it's a Federal Statute and the province chooses not to enforce it for the Feds, in Ontario. I suspect in other jurisdictions it's different but then roe fishing is not permitted elsewhere in Canada. The second reason conveniently dovetails with the compromise  (or should that be compromising?) for fish retention as it sits in Ontario. The MNR feels it  would be impossible (unwilling?)to prove whether the roe came from Ontario streams, 2 fish limit, or from the Ontario side of the lake, 5 fish limit, or from the local baitshop, or grocery store, or US streams, or US lake (the flyboys in NY, Penn., Ohio love it when Ontatio anglers come down on brown egg runs don't they). Like many things you should be carefull what you wish for since it might come back to bite you in the butt. Not that Ontario anglers need worry that a roe ban is on any sort of horizon around here. Virtually everyone is married to it and even when the MNR knows that over harvest for bait is rife particularly in the GTA they choose to bury the study rather than face the wrath of the angler community."

You eat dandlions and drink soy milk from sustainable organic farms, while looking down the glasses at us carnivore's.  You eat nothing with a face or heart, we totally get it your the OFC representation for P3TA.....we totally get it. You like to post information that in many cases is false or speculative at best, we get that too.  You dont like to do any form or conservation work, yet love to use the resource as much as you can, we get that too....and boy do you like to spount your anti everything agenda on the internet while getting banned off forums ...we get that too. WE GET YOUR POINT...we really really get it.  Thank you for speaking up did I say we hear your message  Harvesting fish from a sustainable fishery is a great source of food and comfort, we get you love soy milk and are a macro vegan, because if your not what a complete hypocrite but hey  we get it maybe its pot stirring or simply too much pot, of course organically grown with no animal testing involved... Harvesting fish to eat and use thier eggs as bait is legal, an accepted practice and while in certain cases not right due to the fragiity of a fishery its still within someones right, we get that too.... please go away, I think we all get that message too"
680085,chessy,2012-03-26 03:14:00,610, you are 100 percent correct  and this run has been predicted now for the last 3 and 4 years ago when we had the wet summers
680091,John Bacon,2012-03-26 03:59:00,3277," That is true if they get wet. If they are kept cool and dry then you have more time. When MEA collects eggs they are fertilized several hours later at the hatchery. We only harvest loose eggs from ""ripe"" females.  I doubt that immature eggs would work. I don't have actual data to back that up; but my expectation is that are simply not ready to be fertilized."
680095,Snidley,2012-03-26 04:23:00,620,"Louis I get it too. The only thing I don't eat is cows and pigs out of concern for my personal health. You on the other hand eat everything, way too much of everything I believe. By the way Louis by the sound of your earlier post it looks like you and CRAA are preparing the ground for some backtracking on Atlantics. Oh well it wasn't your money. By the way if guys feel the need for it and they don't mind the mess worms, grubs, minnows, cut bait are all a-ok by me. Just not spawn since I would like to see all this conservation work pay off before  the egg collectors determine that one early run means local tribs are ship shape and 2 a trip hens becomes SOP."
680097,tonka-toy,2012-03-26 04:47:00,139,"Agree,and this year as four years ago less harvest will occur due to the large number of fish that will be done and back to the lake before the open season.More eggs laid plus a cool/wet summer,if we are lucky,should make us happy in another four years."
678954,torco,2012-03-23 20:05:00,656,"  I could not have said it better, if it was all about food for the table it would be much more efficient to visit your local grocery store.   On another sub topic of this very interesting thread, I would open to piloting a no roe/live bait fishing zone on the rivers. I'd be curious to see if it diminishes some of idiots we see and the total lack of regard for ethical harvesting, alot of you good steelhead anglers don't use roe exclusively anyways. That said this would punish the responsible angler."
678957,Richard S.,2012-03-23 20:14:00,75," With the lack of enforcement now it wouldn't make a difference, you'd still have guys keeping females for roe and using roe. Lowering the limits is the key in both the lake and streams.   Rich."
678965,torco,2012-03-23 20:34:00,656," Definitely agree on the limits. And that is another great point, no enough resources to enforce the current rules as is."
678992,esoxansteel,2012-03-23 21:20:00,1307,"When I view the numbers given over the fishway, and I see actual numbers of just over 6000 fish for 2011, and then a guestimate number by the MNR or the LOMU for the same year at over 9000, which is over 3000 fish, im sceptical at how they add another 1/3rd to the population, by pulling a number out of the hat, maybe its so they do not have to do sampling this year, because they see a rebound in the population because of their gueestimate, or they are given or trying to give anglers a false sence of security based on Corbetts that Steelhead numbers are increasing, which may or may not be true, but base the numbers on actual fish passing through, and not fabricated guestimates by the MNR or LOMU. When I volunteers at the ladder through the boom years from 84 to 91 there seemed to be a strong bond with the volunteers of the Ganaraska Sportsman Associan (GSA) who helped fund the counter, and the MNR with mentoring biologist like Dave Bell, and Arnie and im sorry his last name illudes me, and as a group we came in with realistic numbers to account for the fish who pass through the counter undetected, ie multiple fish passing through at the same time or smaller fish who might not count, but in no way would we guestimate a 1/3rd more fish made it through on a run of 6000, in 1989 when over 18,000 when through counted, that would be a guestimate by todays fisheries management people of over 9000, putting the run of 89 at over 27,000 fish which is way off, FYI their was likely another 10,000 plus fish in the lower river below the ladder that year, and the long gone but classic file factory hole hole held fish till early July, the factory although dilapitated is still there, and the high water marks are still on the river side of the building from the flood of 1980, to give you an idea of how high the water got."
679011,timmeh,2012-03-23 22:05:00,609,The loss of groundwater fed streams and spawning habitat is a bigger problem than any roe hunters or charters. No limit reduction or change in regs will make a difference without our coldwater streams. This is going to be the biggest threat to our trout populations in general in the near future.  If every angler who pounds the banks or takes a charter gave a single day a year to volunteer helping restore our coldwater streams it would be the best thing they could do to improve the fishery.
679106,Snidley,2012-03-24 01:25:00,620,"Craig makes a great point, as always. Ontario anglers must face reality and learn to count as a good day, a fish retention less outing. Something clearly not practiced here. It goes without saying that many of the charter guys and even more so the derby guys, take way too many fish usually with some screed about the fish dying anyway or the needs or rights to turn a fishery into a contest, for profit(for a very elite few). With that said the idea that bait anglers are not the biggest problem defies simple mathematics. There must be at least 20k stream anglers in the GTA (there's probably more if casual early season trout opener anglers are counted). If they keep 2 hens per season, or 6 per season like some chap thinks is ""reasonable"" then you are knocking 20 to 60k HENS out of the breeding pool on top of natural attrition. You guys are targeting the breeding females of the fish you claim to love... for bait. It is unsustainable and everyone knows it. The other pap, usually served up by CRAA is that stream improvement is a panacea answer to fisheries improvement. Well they've been at it for 20+ years so where's the improvement fellas. Bottom line the route to improvement is through large scale stocking just like what is being successfully done about 40 miles due south across Lake O or Lake Erie. Tens of thousands of fish in every stream and who cares if the headwaters are warm. Under those circumstances even bait angling can be allowed without it ruining the fishing for the other anglers. Unfortunately both the thumb twiddling of the MNR toward salmonoids and the misdirection from CRAA/OFAH we won't get large scale stocking nor will we get any semblance of enforcement so we are left with anglers self policing. Given self policing as a policy directed at the general public all I can say is God help us, we are doomed."
679140,Richard S.,2012-03-24 02:44:00,75," Here we go again, stream improvment is working river temps have dropped dramatically over the last dacade. In middle sections where it was baren of trees there are ones now 20 ft high if not highter, don't believe me just check out our web site under before and after projects, the same goes with return mumbers. They are way up as well, the 2011/12 season is the biggest we've seen in 20 years, and catch numbers will account for this. As for stocking yes it works if you want a band-aid solution to the problem and who cares about the headwaters? We do, what about the cold water fishery in the upper credit? Or should we say screw it and stock the crap outta our rivers? What a bunch of crap snidley, never anything positive always negative.   Rich."
679178,aniceguy,2012-03-24 03:53:00,1094,"I really tried to stay out of this discussion for a whole host of reasons. With about 20 hours a week working on fish related issues and lots lately around these rainbows Ill drop a few things to this conversation  There are several dozen peer reviewed documents that discuss retention vs. reproduction out there so I Ill try to not make this a 300 page topic just some bullet points  THE LAKE The only factual thing that I agree with Mr Robinson is that the lake did reset its self. In the 80's the lake's nutrient load was much higher than today, those that remember can talk about Pea Soup and lack of clarity, what that allowed was a massive food web to form from algae to zooplankton to the fish we all catch.  This allowed the MNR in its lack of knowledge to stock the lake to what it felt recreational anglers wanted in a put delay and take fishery, with minimal account for natural reproduction. What we had was this massive fishery dependent on hatchery stock, anglers happy MNR happy and here we go. Invasive creatures come and take clarity from a foot in some cases to 30 feet in some instances now.  That reset the food web to a degree that massive stocking could and cannot be supported by Lake Ontario, as they will most certainly eat them elves out of house and home the lakes food web would crash and what happened on Georgian bay with the Chinook crash would happen here, leaving lake Ontario a very empty piece of water. While I dont always agree with MNR managers caution made sense here, and we can all play a blame game but the truth is stocking decreased for fear we would see a collapsed fishery due to a toppling of the predator pray balance, my understanding is we have come close a few times. What has happened from then to now is the MNR has changed how they believe this salmonid fishery should be, one thats driven by natural reproduction via a sustainable fishery, landing on such MNR doctrines such as SPOF 2, Ontarios biodiversity strategy,  right down to local FMZs and watershed management plans.  They attempt when possible to make decisions on a matrix that believe it or not isnt driven by Anglers and their wants and needs but rather provincial mandates such as Native rights and beyond, in fact recreational fishing I believe ranks third on their management hierarchy. As new science comes available, and our province starts to see how our partners in most of these waters work Canada is generally last to react, health care pensions schools all take the money; I think MNR is less than 1% of the entire provincials budget and shrinking daily and I suspect is about to get another big gutting in the next provincial budget. NOW What we have today is an MNR that is so under capacity they cant buy shoe laces let alone fund multi thousand studies to determine what is sustainable.  How our fishery reacts to climate change, angling pressure, environmental factors such as development affecting habitat and more. For the most part MNR has now become a permit review agency with little to no real ability to do on the ground assessment and or habitat work. They are generally left with small snap shots of watersheds that as a rule had under designed studies, lack of funding, poor timing windows on studies, Massive data gaps modeling software that is decades old or not constructed properly to act as an assessment tool, I could go on forever on this but the end result is that there is not enough clear data to make proper assessment decisions in the MNR today, so MNR airs on the side of caution constantly. Bottom line here is this, outside jurisdiction science has shown that the bullet number to achieve a sustainable fish population such as rainbows is around 30% retention, regardless if its harvest natural, mortality predation or anything in between. Without a concrete study being undertaken by MNR (which we see they cant afford) there is no real way to determine true harvest and the vast majority of things that come from MNR speculative at best. What we do know with some certainty that at 5 fish in the river environment harvest was a massive concern and did not provide a sustainable fishery, MNR has admitted that.  Creel surveys done by CRAA as part of our management of the Port Credit Boat launch during the GOSD we have been able to see harvest in the 90% range, very far from the 33% number. Does a 2 fish retention create a sustainable fishery, I dont think so personally but its a step in  the right direction, we know from many of the literature that a 1 fish with a slot would most certainly lead to a sustainable fishery ( of note the US has a 1 fish with a slot on rainbows) .  The other bottle neck here is that Ontario still continues with this archaic two system license, and with a 1 fish slot limit on rainbows, conservation licenses would be told a 0 retention applies, negating their right to harvest. MNR understands in many cases there needs to be change; the lake has the best manager I have seen …well…ever, so I think its all going to the right direction. So how do we as anglers help create sustainable fisheries when the MNR lacks the ability to do so, simply by letting them swim back that are how because every one sent back to swim is one more we can catch.  Harvesting from a put and delay system doesnt justify anything as fish roam and live in the same body of water. CRAA had a fish we tagged it spawned and returned to an eastern tributary in a few weeks. Tagged fish that were transferred to spawn in the Credit  and were caught off ollcott 2 weeks later. While rainbows are slightly less plastic then other trout species   they still drift from watershed to watershed, and a fish caught in Burt Dam might have its origins in the head waters of the Wilmot as a two year repeat spawner and suddenly found the concrete wall at the Burt go figure. OFAH I think I could write a book here on the group, sadly many have said the points already. What is most amusing is their involvement in the Atlantic Salmon Restoration Program run by the MNR where they are a lead partner.  CRAA has a current scientific proposal with the MNR to allow all native, naturalized and desired fish species above Norval to study a competitive interaction; simply put we feel its a prudent piece to the eco system of the Credit to see how multi species interact with one another while allowing native fish species caught below dams access to their historical water,it sits as a five year study at this point. This would include full access to the Atlantic which is having dismal success primarily due to the lack of access to spawning habitat, yet they dont support a that proposal would give the Atlantic exactly what it needs access to habitat, theyre not supporting such a proposal says they dont wish even Native fish species to have access to historical water, in effect stop them at a dam and thats it. .  If an Organization cant support a program to allow a fish such as the Atlantic  or other native fish species to naturally reproduce in the wild, the Atlantic salmon, the very same fish they have spent millions of dollars to re-introduce, then that begs the question what does OFAH really stand for…..?    As a conservationist I get very frustrated at the stop still in their tracks methodology of the MNR.  We see something that makes sense and want to run with it, we find the science, find the money in many cases and are stopped dead in the tracks of progress even when we cite MNRs own policy pieces a brick wall comes up, due to this lack of capacity, very frustrating and I ll put some money that in the not so distant future someone will litigate the province and MNR over this very same lack of capacity. MNR has a responsibility to us all and with their lack of capacity these days we are lucky they even exist.  We also need to be very clear on banning bait or angling methods, fishing is a shrinking market and if we ban angling methods, tactics, or bait options we exclude potential new anglers further adding to the declining community."
679216,solopaddler,2012-03-24 11:32:00,8605,"  This is wrong on so many levels it's laughable. Your refrain is becoming tiresome, seriously.  I appreciate your obvious passion for the sport and you're no doubt an excellent angler, but your thoughts regarding conservation and improving the fishery are ill conceived.  I'm not going to offer a counter argument, it's been done ad nauseum countless times on this and other boards over the years every time you start to spew your rhetoric.  No one will ever convince you otherwise, but consider giving it a rest."
679254,Garnet,2012-03-24 12:57:00,2056,It takes boys and girls to make little trout.  If you want dum as stump stocked fish you drive the 40 mile south. Me I will take stream rehab and natural reproduction.
679269,Snidley,2012-03-24 13:50:00,620,"Anyone fished the Saugeen lately? Is it a fishery driven by stream improvement? No. It's driven by stocking, heavy stocking by a dedicated fishing club that by and large consider CRAA and it's methods laughable. They have worked around the MNR to find a way to re create a fishery were CRAA can't find that path. Would it be an even better fishery if roe as bait was not permitted? Yes, it would be, however just like down here anglers are trained from early on that the way to catch salmonoids is to use eggs. It is not the only way nor even the best way to catch salmonoids but it is the easy way. Sort of like lamplighting in Australia. Or shooting Turkeys in a roost. Or targeting Bass on nests. I take lots of flack from other steelheaders over this issue no doubt. It's always the same guys, roe anglers all, who essentially frame all their perspective in light of a base of fishing with the spawn of a fish they claim to want to conserve. It is absurd obviously and you don't see any other angling group  even considering targeting spawning fish to get bait. I repeat, give anglers a self policing environment and you will see carnage as a result. I also suggest that any angler that thinks stocked steelhead are ""dumb"" or ""weak"" go down to the Whirlpool in April or May and see just how dumb/weak they are. Or go out to the blue zone in August and deal with the schooling steelies out there. Weak, I think not. Willing biters, yes they are that but it could hardly be considered a negative trait in a gamefish."

679319,solopaddler,2012-03-24 15:37:00,8605,"  I cannot believe you're using the Saugeen as an example!  Yes the runs have improved because of stocking, BUT they're not stocking hatchery mutants they're taking wild brood stock from the river, rearing them to smolt size and releasing them. They're not tampering with what's already a vibrant wild strain.  In addition they've opened up miles of headwater nursery waters for steelhead to spawn in. The Saugeen is likely the largest coldwater trib in southern ON when all of it's substantial feeder streams are factored in.  YES the run was given a kick start by stocking, BUT the fishery is intended to be and WILL be self sustaining and viable.  I cannot believe you are criticizing the efforts of CRAA, seriously? Have you fished the river at all this past year? I'm guessing not because you seem to look down on it for whatever reason. How are you making out fishing the estuary in your kick boat?  I can tell you this the Credit has fished better these last few months than I've ever seen it. Not since the early 80's have I experienced angling of this quality.  Best part is they are mostly WILD fish and CRAA is entirely responsible.  You really need to rethink your misguided perceptions."

Hell I'll even start taking donations to help cover the one way ticket needed. You sit at home and clam to know so much about the fishery when you really know nothing at all. Your answer to everything is CRAA, MNR, and OFAH are bad. They do nothing and oh yeah while we are at it lets stock, stock, and well stock some more. You need to get new material this crap you spew is boaring."
679362,BillM,2012-03-24 17:22:00,17367," Time to stop using that 'I've fished for 30 years' excuse because it's obvious you haven't stepped foot on the river bank (Especially the Saugeen) in quite some time.  If you like mutant stockers so much, move to the southern shore of Lake Erie and have your fill."
679371,Snidley,2012-03-24 17:28:00,620,"Who said stocking had to be from brood stock. Certainly not the Americans as they also take striped eggs only. Stocking most definitely should only be from wild fish and at no time did I ever say it should be otherwise. The originating strain is important as well. The Saugeen is a better fishery today because of large scale and CONSISTENT stocking and even though it is a great fishery today if they stop stocking it will fall precipitously. Fortunately there are no plans that I am aware of to stop stocking  and transferring fish at the Saugeen.  Any fishery with any species other than Carp, where anglers insist on carrying off the fish they catch in large unsustainable numbers will be doomed to shortages. This is magnified with steelhead due to the fact that ""traditional"" roe anglers will always keep hens over bucks because they get meat and bait as opposed to meat only. I guess it makes them feel better but in a highly populated area like the GTA the skewed numbers taken will always outstrip the natural reproductive capacity of the river enhanced stream improvements not withstanding. I hope things are better at the Credit and steam improvements are no doubt a good thing but the continued insistence of anglers keeping hens will simply mean that at the end of the day there will just be more and fuller stringers as the new anglers ape the experienced ones, including the executives of a ""conservation"" group, that demonstrate by action that roe collection as a fishing tactic is ok. Roe collection/prioritized retention of hens is not ok in any fishery faced with shortages. Period. In addition roe use under such circumstances is only allowed in Ontario no where else that I know of would permit it.Since it appears that addiction to eggs for bait is an unchangeable tradition in this province, and the MNR has clearly decided that this is the case, then there has to be a large scale stocking effort to replace the lost breeders with replacements just like they have done down south and, to a lesser extent, on the 'Geen."

679382,Grimace,2012-03-24 18:12:00,2020,"I am way out of my league here but I have a couple of questions for the (many) people that know way more than I.  I attended the Lake Ontario Trout and Salmon Symposium last April in Port Credit.  I was very impressed with the event.  Of the talks given that day, the one that stuck in my mind the most was Dr. Tom Stewart's presentation on Lake Ontario's offshore food web called 'It's a Jungle Out There'.  Here is the link to Symposium, this is the page with the seminars on it.  Attached in that page are the PDF's with each one's content.     http://lakeontariofishingforum.com/speakers.html  This is the PDF for 'It's a Jungle Out There'.     http://lakeontariofishingforum.com/2-Foodweb_Update.pdf   My question's.  If we keep overstocking fish, will they not eat too much of the food and induce a bait fish crash?  And if the large amount of Fleas are eating all of the plankton and the Alewife have nothing to eat, won't stocking of trout and salmon then be kind of pointless?  I am not trying to be facetious in any way here, I am genuinely asking these questions.  The answers might seem obvious to the people 'in the know', but for a weekend warrior like myself who only reads the odd piece and attends the odd seminar they might seem a bit more elusive.  Thanks for any replies that I might get.  I probably should have started a new thread but seeing as this thread has taken this turn I figured I would just go with it.  My apologies to the OP if this is looked upon as a highjack."
679413,gaspumper,2012-03-24 19:52:00,393,Jeees here I thought we were talking about fish going through the ladder at the Ganny.
679418,Sinker,2012-03-24 19:59:00,8692,"  Why do you think it would fall precipitously? Whatever that reason is....that is what you have to repair. I know nothing about the saugeen, but I know if fish have proper habitat, they will reproduce succesfully.  I'm sure there is a lot more to it than that, but its a good start. Its not going to happen over night, but they will eventually reproduce themselves if they have the habitat. You can stock it till the end of time, but if they can't reproduce, stocking will NEVER end. Create some habitat so they will reproduce, and then spend that saved money from raising fish somewhere else, where its needed.  Habitat is the key, I don't care what anyone argues. If fish can't reproduce, you won't have fish.....pretty simple isn't it?? That theory works with any species, not just your beloved rainbows.  Now, feeding all these fish is another story. I know nothing about lake huron's bait situation, but I've heard its not good.  S."
679424,Snidley,2012-03-24 20:09:00,620,"Grimace a great deal depends on what species you are concerned with. Steelhead/Rainbows have a much more diverse forage base than Salmon, that's one of the reasons they are the most widely distributed non native fish in the world. Given a depressed abundance of shad and smelts in Lake Ontario then Steelhead will eat Gobies, bugs, crustaceans  I'm told they even eat fleas. Salmon will starve in the same situation. The true bottom line is that there are lots of Steelhead in Lake Ontario but distribution is not so great and the reason is obvious to most anglers (but not so much here). Ontario has entered into a Devils bargain with New York that mandates massive stocking in American tribs while Ontario will attempt ""sustainable"" natural reproduction with only very limited stocking (and a lot of the MNR stocking is in fact from old brood stock from a suspect original strain of rainbow. In many cases even this is not the total story as MNR stocking technique often means dumping the stockers off breakwalls and in harbours. It is a horrible waste of a shallow resource). We are now living with the results. Tons of fish in New York tribs, maybe even more abundance than is healthy, and, despite what the coffee clatch here is selling, a lot less Steelhead in our tribs to a level that makes killing any of what is available here a tragedy that anglers adamantly refuse to acknowledge. Roe angling/collection exacerbates this situation greatly."
679433,Snidley,2012-03-24 20:26:00,620,"To Sinker's point over harvest will consistently trump natural reproduction. That's why, in places where natural reproduction is the management technique, minimal limits, retention of stockers only, slot sizes, roe bans, bait bans, gear restrictions and outright ban on harvest is the norm for virtually every jurisdiction where Steelhead and Salmon are found...except Ontario. Habitat is most definitely NOT the key, it is far from simple and this does apply to any species that people like to eat(or use their spawn for bait). You are correct on one point, stocking will NEVER END in an urban fishery where there's 4 million potential anglers that need homes, industry, waste disposal etc. It's a reality fundamental to an abundant fishery."

I'm thinking of one person in particular 4 years ago caught every few fish at the Ganny 3 years ago we started helping him a little started to catch some and ate everyone. Last year in caught a lot and kept way to many.  This year he caught tons and kept almost nothing. In these 4 years he constantly upgraded equipment he has also start some friends steelheading is learning how to Tye Fly's and the circle continues.  Making trout fishing difficult No Thanks I like to see kids show up on the river with not great equipment put their hours in upgrade and become great anglers.

678679,Paulus,2012-03-23 00:29:00,522," Agreed. I just ate one tonight  - she gave me roe and a good meal, cooked in curry by a friend.

If I can get the recipe, I'll post it here.  Anyway, one thing about lake O fish is that they are not as polluted as they used to be. They've got a bad reputation that's hung around since the 60's, 70's and 80's when you could basically use the PCB's in 'em to recycle tires, and the mercury to make new thermometers. Nowadays, they are cleaner than any farm raised fish that are not ""bio.""  So, if you're going to keep a hen - eat her too. She's yummy  p.s.

It's amazing there's any fish to catch at all. The true solution is NO roe fishing, NO keeping wild fish, Salmon /Steelhead tags that limit ANNUAL catch not daily or weekly limits roundly abused by all (Federal law mandates that roe IS considered a fish but as it is a Federal Statute the lame MNR does not enforce it). These laws would put Ontario on par with BC, the place these animals come from and  where these ARE the rules.

It would be a reduction in fishing and harvest opportunities for no appreciable benefit.  The ""steady decline"" referred to in the proposal isn't present once you account for the lake re-setting itself in the early to mid-1990s.  I'd also suggest reading NY's creel survey results for the last few years, and the recent LOMU report's rainbow trout chapter.  Yours in Conservation, Chris Robinson OFAH"

678845,BillM,2012-03-23 16:10:00,17367, I don't think anyone would have a problem if the charter boat guys also used selective harvest..  A little education goes a long way.

678898,justin elia,2012-03-23 18:14:00,151," I'm not sure why you're thanking me. I do believe that lake anglers harvest more fish based on what I see at boat launches across the north shore of lake O and in the rivers.  The NY side has its own creel data to gather info from, it doesn't mean that the stream anglers that fish the north shore of Lake O are more likely to harvest a fish.  With a 5 fish limit per person and no slot size, it doesn't take long for the numbers to add up from the lake.  My point to OFAH was that it's not rocket science, a reduction in limits WILL increase fish numbers therefore increasing fishing opportunities and making the resource better. There are studies based on the tribs of the north shore of superior that back this up.  Craig made some interesting points about BC and the rebound of the Coho from selective harvest."

678923,chessy,2012-03-23 19:07:00,610, How can you start the letter like that ??? i was a member at the time and i am not in favor of that along with allot of other people that were members or are still members and as far as the LOMU reports go those are not worth the paper they are written on those reports are absolute fallacy
678925,Richard S.,2012-03-23 19:12:00,75,"Plain and simple, OFAH only cares about what it wants and screw everyone else!  Rich."
678927,craigdritchie,2012-03-23 19:17:00,1586," With all due respect Chris, my opinion is that OFAH needs to shift its focus away from an emphasis on outright harvest and more toward an emphasis on creating sustainable fishing opportunities. The value of a quality fishing experience far exceeds the value of a bunch of dead trout (which my local Loblaws says is only about $3.99 a pound). People buy licenses, and tackle, and book space on charter boats, in order to enjoy a fishing experience. If the only thing that mattered was how much dead meat can be taken home at the end of the day, we would all be better off to just go to the supermarket and buy the fish we need - it would be a lot easier and far less expensive.  I spent $350 to catch a bunch of coho one afternoon last month off of Vancouver Island. Know how many fish I killed? Zero. Had a great time, and would do it again in a second.  When I want a salmon to eat, I'll buy a wild sockeye for $10 at the local market.  OFAH's continued insistence on defining the success of a fishing experience by the number of fillets in the cooler at the end of the day is archaic thinking that's simply out of place in today's world."
678014,tb4me,2012-03-21 00:02:00,3295,Thanks Solo..Do you have any links that would share your thoughts? Im like a sponge wanting to read and learn on my loacl trout waterways..Of course the MNR site has very little that I could find.
678060,crappieperchhunter,2012-03-21 01:50:00,2582,Not trying to stir the pot...just offering my opinion on the topic.  IMHO river fishermen outnumber charter fishermen by a country mile. When I used to fish chrome more then I do now...6 hens killed a year for roe... was  a very conservative estimate.  I think the damage to the fishery is far greater by the river guys...I don't even think the charter guys come close.  Having said that I have to agree with Craig. Dead is dead it doesn't matter where or when the fish met it's maker.  I hope the numbers coming over the dam are as good as is being reported. It bodes well for everyone who enjoys the fishery.
678072,MJL,2012-03-21 02:11:00,2427,"I remember back in the day, the counter would be turned on at the beginning of April. Is it on year round now?  A friend of mine left me a message on FB saying the counter is at 3021 fish as of today. Normally I would expect that number around the 2nd or 3rd  week of April!"
678074,Richard S.,2012-03-21 02:15:00,75,No it's just turned on in the spring. So the run estimates are including the fish that jump the ladder before the counter is turned on.  Rich.

678116,12footspringbok,2012-03-21 10:56:00,459," No problem.  Its just too easy to point fingers.  Like you said, bad apples in every group."
678137,Hairpy,2012-03-21 12:49:00,73,"CPH, there's no way the river guys kill more fish than the lake/charter guys. The problem I have with the charters is that they still think that all their customers want to keep all their fish (old school mind set i guess) Most places there are hatchery fish stocked for the taking and the wild fish are VERY protected! Why the hell can't we inforce the same theory on Lake Ontario?  Joseph"
678138,BillM,2012-03-21 12:51:00,17367,"Selective harvest is the key, regardless if it's out in the lake or in the rivers..  Keep those stockers, that's EXACTLY what they are for.... table fare."
678148,Paulus,2012-03-21 13:39:00,522," Totally agree with both statements. It's the same everywhere there are steelhead on Lake Ontario right now. They all just suddenly showed up and are assaulting the dams en masse. I think by the end of next week, most of them will be up & the per-day count will be down to a few dozen.  Also, it's such an early run that most of these fish - feast your eyes on them now because you won't be feasting on the fish later - will be long gone by April 28th. This will at least keep most of them out of the smoking baskets of opening day frenzy - which is good! (as long as we don't get a scorching, dry summer...  )  See how dark already?    Go 'bows!  p.-"
678149,craigdritchie,2012-03-21 13:40:00,1586,"  Couldn't agree more. When I was on Vancouver Island a few weeks ago I fished out of Victoria one afternoon. There, you can only keep hatchery coho (which have the adipose fin clipped) - all wild (unclipped) ones have to go back, no exceptions. This has been the policy for several years now, and as a result wild coho numbers are improving every year. It used to be you caught about 50-50 hatchery to wild fish. Now, it's more like 10 percent hatchery, even though they still stock the same number of fish. It's really helped the wild ones to rebound.  If we could get MNR to strip some wild fish at the ladder, stock them in places like the Humber or Don, that don't have much (if any) reproduction, then let people go at them, it would take a LOT of pressure off the wild fish we're all trying to protect. Why they refuse to do it is beyond me."
678150,Paulus,2012-03-21 13:41:00,522,And good roe containers   ...  p.-
678151,BillM,2012-03-21 13:43:00,17367, Absolutely..  I've got no issues keeping a few fat stockers from the southern shore Lake E/Lake O tribs to fill my freezer with..
678156,l2p,2012-03-21 14:10:00,346,I think since last fall i've only caught one clipper from lake ontario...
678232,Hairpy,2012-03-21 18:08:00,73,"Guys , hatchery fish are not always clipped! To identify a hatchery fish look for wonky soft dorsal fins and shorter rounder pectoral and anal fins, they get like this from over capacity in the tanks. Wild fish will most likely have very pronounced long opaque pec fins and a big stiff dorsal fin and in a lot of cases will have a warn out tail on the bottom from previous mating rituals.  We spend thousands of volunteer hours each year to raise these hatchery fish to create more fishing opportunities at the same time it takes a lot of pressure away from the wild spawners.  Joseph"
678234,davey buoy,2012-03-21 18:10:00,5505, Great info!.
678244,newb09,2012-03-21 18:33:00,49,"The amount of harvested fish in the river is nothing compared to the massacre that is taking place on the lake. Why is that? the only explanation that I can think of is ""Money talk""..if it makes money, it is allowed. It's Disgusting, isn't it?"
678248,chessy,2012-03-21 18:38:00,610,Hey one of the biggest groups against the 2 fish limit is the OFAH   even there club members are all for the 2 fish limit but head office is against it.... if you want a 2 fish limit and you are a member you best be calling them and telling them the ofah does not speak for you !!!!
678251,Richard S.,2012-03-21 18:49:00,75,"Seems like ofah is against lowering limits everywhere. I do agree there should be an urban fishery created in places that have little or no natural reproduction at all. I don't agree with the Humber being on of those places, it's a big river with a ton of potential now the don on ther hand is a perfect choice.  Rich."
678269,Paulus,2012-03-21 19:32:00,522," I totally agree about the Don. It's come a long way in the last 15 years. For the stewardship program that's already in place, there could be no better or more timely ally than a bunch of fishermen who want nothing more than to see it get better - now. It would also give them unprecendted economical influence.  p.-"
678293,Hairpy,2012-03-21 20:57:00,73,"I can't see why OFAH would be against the 2 fish idea. If you want to take fish home then take home the ""put and Take fish"" like coho's and chinooks that are stocked and leave the wild ones alone to establish themselves  Joseph"
678295,chessy,2012-03-21 21:01:00,610, chinooks in the ganaraka river are natural reproduced... the estimate is over 80 % .. we will find out in the fall
678306,Richard S.,2012-03-21 21:30:00,75,I'd say that for any system that flows into the big O in regards the salmon.  Rich.

677755,chessy,2012-03-20 00:55:00,610,"liverelease . well in my opinion the 2010 count of 9058 is absolute crap. we had aprox 4900 fish through the counter and a percentage of them we can not count so lets say 10 percent are smaller than 14 inches or 16   . They use air temperature to get there data and they say lots went over before we got counter in ... i say bull crap  i have been at the ladder since i was 10 i am not 43  i can never remember a day of 1000 fish, can you remember the year that 1000 went over in a single day   thanks"

677811,craigdritchie,2012-03-20 03:16:00,1586,"I wouldn't say the numbers are complete lies, but they are estimates. And, not necessarily accurate ones in my humble opinion.  As someone who fished the Ganny a lot during the glory years, I can tell you the number of fish in the river right now is still not even close to what you would see in the years when they had 15,000+ through the ladder. There's just no comparison at all. The steelhead run there is still just a shadow of what it once was ..... sad, really."
677868,Garnet,2012-03-20 13:17:00,2056,I fished the glory years and every other year and this is the best run sense the 80's. The 1 concern is very few small fish.
677915,l2p,2012-03-20 17:45:00,346,"Definitely the most fish i've ever seen at the ladder, sad to see so many cut up fish from the sharp edges of the dam though.  "

677931,solopaddler,2012-03-20 19:21:00,8605," Don't want to open a can of worms here, but the biggest issue is the multiple limits of 5 fish that the charter guys keep in the summer on a regular basis.  The short sightedness of our MNR never ceases to amaze me.  You are of course correct as well Joe. Angler harvest in the rivers no matter the time of year (the equation remains the same whether it's spring,fall or winter) is definitely a concern.  Personally I see more catch and release happening on the river than ever before so things are improving, albeit with the speed of a glacier."
677935,Richard S.,2012-03-20 19:38:00,75,"Best numbers of fish that ive seen the fall of 97, spring of 98 season.  But yes a reduction of limits has to happen, especially in the big lake. Five fish x six guys equates to a lot fish daily that are being taken from the charter boats, ive seen it way to many times when I lived in Mississauga.  Rich."
677938,Hairpy,2012-03-20 19:48:00,73,"Very true Mike , I just didn't want to russle too many feathers here as there are members of this board that charter out that way. Ricky the worst part is that 5 fish x 6 guests = 30 dead steelhead (mostly wild) that will most likely end up in someones freezer and then in the garbage.  Joseph"
677939,l2p,2012-03-20 19:49:00,346,"I used to work summers at the bluffs so I've seen it as well, also have to agree with Solo that there are less fish being kept on the tribs."

677950,esoxansteel,2012-03-20 20:18:00,1307,"There was strong support for a 2 fish Lake limit, ironically with all the steelheaders there are and how passionate they are about their sport, when the question went to public about support for the decreased limit, there was barely 100 people who responded, out of those only 4 were against the decreased limit, that was told to me by the gentlemen who overseas the FMZ 20, and was brought forth at our FMZ 17 meeting, he was suprised by the lack of public response as I was, with the provincial election that took place, during the time when the 2 fish proposed limit was brought forth, it got shoved back in the pile, in favour of electing a premier, again that was conveyed to me by MNR personelle, or it could have possibly been in the regs for 2012, so as it stands 2013 is the earliest it could possibly happen, and it might have to go to the public for imput again, and all proposals have to be in by a certain timeline, so they pass through the lines of command, until its rubber stamped and approved as law and added into the regs.  Chessy would you keep giving us totals through the fishway, as its very interesting for us all, and for us steelheaders that were there in the glory days of the mid 80s, and who fished the river before their was a ladder pre 74."
677952,solopaddler,2012-03-20 20:27:00,8605,"  Wow, I sure didn't expect this type of response, but okay I'll bite.  Truth be told I get a large portion of my roe at the fish cleaning stations in late August when the charter guys come in.  They just toss it in the trash.  I'll also admit to harvesting the odd female from south shore Erie trib's where it's an entirely put and take fishery.  Nice try though.  There's bad apples in every lot. By and large though river fishermen display a lot more concern for the fishery and for conservation in general. The average Joe Blow who books a corporate charter once a year for him and his coworkers and fills the coolers in the process is much more destructive.  Why is there a 2 fish limit in the rivers and 5 in the lake? Could the answer boil down to money?  Anyhow, thanks for coming out."
677968,Richard S.,2012-03-20 21:19:00,75,Hey I have no problem with people keeping fish IF the fishery can sustain it and with the limits being the way they are now it cannot. We are lucky that we've had a bunch of cold/wet summers to help the little guys along or else we'd be F'ed.  Rich.
677987,craigdritchie,2012-03-20 23:02:00,1586,"At the end of the day, it doesn't matter whether the fish are kept out in the lake, or in the river .... in the spring, or in summer, fall or winter. A dead fish won't go on to spawn regardless of where or when it meets its maker.  A reduction in overall harvest levels simply has to happen. In my personal view, chopping the limit to three fish, so it's consistent with New York and thus easily enforceable, would be a good start.  We will have to see if the Ganny run actually is larger this year, or if we're just seeing all the fish come in at once thanks to the sudden arrival of very warm temperatures. Remember, the last two weeks have been MUCH warmer than normal. Is it really more fish, or is it just all the fish showed up at once? Normally, they trickle in over a span of several weeks. We will only know the answer after they've come and gone.  Given that opening day is still 40 days away (five weeks and change), most will indeed be long gone by the time the fourth Saturday in April rolls around."
