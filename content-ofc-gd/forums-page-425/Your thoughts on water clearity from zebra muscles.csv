680656,Snidley,2012-03-27 19:22:00,620,"That's a lot of fish in one pass. I suppose the fishermen need to make a living but overall I bet the economics of the whole thing would be much better if that resource was based on recreational angling VS commercial fishing. Overall I believe that both Zebra and Quagga mussels have enhanced Smallmouth Bass and Steelhead stocks in Lake Erie and dramatically reduced Walleye stocks in Erie at the same time. There are still lots of Walleye in Erie but not like when the lake was the murky, algae filled swamp it used to be. Not many Walleye anglers would dispute that the mussels as well as the reduction of phosphates in the environment have reduced the Walleye fishery there. An interesting sidebar to this issue is offered by Lake Winnipeg where there are no mussels but there are massively higher nutrient loads that are creating huge algae blooms that can be observed from space. Not only are there more walleyes than ever before in that lake but they are bigger than ever too. Trouble is some of those new algae blooms, mostly the ones found in shallow water, are toxic to mammals so pets and kids are at risk. It seems that nature always offers tradeoffs never a one way loss or victory"
680672,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-03-27 20:25:00,0,"  I appreciate that it is shocking to see a commercial fishery take that many fish in one net pull but 10 boats out fishing could do the same thing.  there are limits on the number of boats that can commercial fish on the great lakes and these boats have a quota based on scientific population estimates... the same can't be said for recreational anglers.  Your anecdotal opinion is appreciated but i work in hard numbers... not opinion.  Look up the stats for the estimated biomass taken by commercial fishing vs. recreational fishing and present those to us and I'll agree with you!!  But we need facts, not opinions and finger pointing. Like i said, the ecology of the great lakes is based on the sum of its parts, not one issue facing it."
680677,outllaw,2012-03-27 20:44:00,1232,"it started here on st clair. species were affected then mother nature corrected the issues. as for fishing walleyes /muskies,,planer boards are a definate plus. sight feeders exploded. as for the statement on commercial netters theres plenty of blame to share. while commercial netters get 99.04 per-cent of quotas, anglers get .06. sports fishing has never achieved theres according to mnr stats. netters will tank nu.2 fish to achieve max dollars on nu.1 fish,,,more money per pound. the true issues lie on walleye spawning grounds. pollution and loss of habitat. just look at the thames walleye spawn. it is near non existent in the last 3 decades. london ont and bad farming efforts have created a toxic non spawning soup. these are facts folks not just thoughts. maybe we should be asking what goverments can do,,, oops i am sorry their broke, they gotta keep up their great pension plans and perks."
680679,Snidley,2012-03-27 20:48:00,620,"You must also factor in economic return when evaluating resource exploitation and I'm betting it would be hard to find sound economic reasons for allowing commercial netting operations on Lake Erie other than for a crazy quilt of heritage, ethnic or historical reasons. More economic activity comes from recreational exploitation of just about every natural resource than comes from sending harvesters out to catch something only to sell it into a cutthroat wholesale distribution system. Maybe at the end of the day a few restaurants make out ok selling fish and chips based on perch but the towns on the Erie coast would do better with hordes of recreational anglers coming out to try their luck, while keeping within reasonable limits, in an abundant perch resource."
680684,Billy Bob,2012-03-27 21:02:00,5865, The fact are sports fishermen are limited by size and bag limit on many species.....gill netters are limited in TONS and every fish caught in a gill net dies if released or not.....I have caught many small perch and walleyes and either let them go because of their size or because there is a size limit....if I catch any bass I ALWAYS let them go....this cannot be done with the killing gill nets....that is why MANY areas gill nets are OUTLAWED....so now you can do the numbers and let me know who is more of a threat to our Great Lakes fisheries...as I already know.
680809,OhioFisherman,2012-03-28 01:46:00,6623," We fought that battle here in Ohio, for years we heard from the commercial fishermen that they weren`t taking enough Walleye to hurt the population, but it became exceptionally rare for a sport fisherman to catch one outside the spawning areas during the early spring runs. Once the state bought up all the commercial fishing licenses for the Walleye netters Lake Erie was full of them again. Sport fishermen don`t have the ability to trap an entire school, whether they are hungry or not and deplete them?  I grew up in the 1950`s and early 60`s fishing Lake Erie, it was a mess on this side that continued to get worse. Fishing areas like Sandusky Bay and East Harbor, 3-4 feet of water and no weeds? We fished the dock areas because it was the only available cover for the fish.  With the Zebra mussels came an increase in water clarity, it is now common to see weed grow in those bays in 10 feet of water. Has it affected fishing? Yes, unless you adapted to the new conditions you might not catch fish where you used to. They don`t have to concentrate in the same areas because of lack of cover or lack of cover for their food supply.  Massive weed areas can be a challenge for some to fish, but they provide protection for young fish and the food that lives in them gives them more of an opportunity to grow."

680902,chris.brock,2012-03-28 03:54:00,4053,"There are 2 lakes in the Chapleau area I'm familiar with that had walleye introduced after being only pike lakes. The walleye fishing was great after 3 or 4 years. I don't think these lakes are going to be ""fish factories"" forever. It takes a quite few years for the aquatic community to reach a ballance. With the invasion of zeebs, things still haven't ballanced. MuskyMike said he thinks the zebra mussles have thinned out abit since first getting established in his area. I think it's too early to judge the affects of zebra mussles, throw in other factors like fishing pressure, climate change, polution etc., and who knows what's really going on. Still, invasive species are bad."
680903,chris.brock,2012-03-28 03:56:00,4053,"oh yeah, MM, I hope the Sens overtake the Bruins (just because I hate the Bruins) and bump them down to 6th or 7th."

680989,Jigger,2012-03-28 13:27:00,1237,"Sinker hit the nail on the head. Adapt or go home with a skunk. Smallies are invasive, pike are invasive, all sorts of aquatic plants are invasive... Deal with it when the time comes. I dont reall fish waters that were overly stained to begin with. So its really a moot point for me."
681319,Oggie,2012-03-29 00:51:00,588, I'd be more ok with commercial fishing if they were monitored frequently. There are very few CO's left so who is watching the commercials.  One commercial boat may do no more damage than 10 recreational boats but the rec boats don't fish daily.
680517,mike rousseau,2012-03-27 13:39:00,4661,"I've seen a lot of people complain about how clear the water is because of the zebra muscles...and how they have destroyed fisheries because they disturbed the food chain...or the fish are ""spooky"" because they can see you now...and so on...  my question to you is....  on the water bodies you fish that have been cleared up by zebra muscles... is the fishing better...worse.... or the same as it was before...?  on the st.lawrence river...in my opinion the bass...musky...and walleye fishing is as good as its ever been...and thats going back 3 generations fishing the same spots...  but i do miss the giant weedbeds that came right to the surface...they were so thick you couldnt drive a boat through them... you had to know where the side channels were... now they are kinda thinned out and started growing a bit deeper in the water..."
680527,bucktail,2012-03-27 14:25:00,1857,Its definatly moved fish deeper I think. But I also think it has been a boom for certain sight feeders like bass. I am wondering if we are going to be seeing a big crash of bass in Erie or is there enough good hatches to carrie the population.  
680528,BillM,2012-03-27 14:26:00,17367,Why would you see a crash in Erie?  It's been gin clear for the past 15+ years.
680532,jimmer,2012-03-27 14:34:00,2730,"They definitely change the lake. I don't know if it make fishing worse, but you sure have to adapt to the changes. The weed growth on my lake has definitely changed due to zebra mussels. Some are gone others are proliferating, like the wild rice and some bottom weed."
680535,lew,2012-03-27 14:51:00,12766,"I've always enjoyed  fishing for muskies after dark and a favorite location is pencil reeds in shallow water with a sandy bottom and even better if there's deep water close by.  We go in after dark and work our way thru the reeds casting slow rolled spinnerbaits and can often grab 3 or 4 nice muskies in a night.  After the zebras moved in and the water began to clear, weeds started to grow in places we never had them before and began encroaching on the pencil reeds. The weeds have now become so thick in many of the areas we used to go that we can no longer even get our boats into the spots anymore, infact on some of the reed beds we can't get within 100' now.  Some of these spots I've been fishing for 40 years and they were always weed free, but the last 10 years or so has seen a huge change in weed growth.  The only thing I put it down to is the clear water, caused by zebra muscles, is allowing more sunlight to penetrate the water and is helping to promote the heavy growth.  I may be totally off in my reasoning though.  I kinda miss those nights...  "

680542,Billy Bob,2012-03-27 14:56:00,5865,"Fishing is DIFFERENT on Lake Erie and many of our inland lakes because of the zebra mussels.....fish are much spookier and at times harder to catch...but the doom days that many ""experts"" predicted never materialized.....Perch and walleye numbers are way up on Erie and the bass population is as good as it has ever been, PLUS they are bigger then ever because of all the gobies in the lake.  Meanwhile Oneida Lake has suffered a lot because of the zebra mussels in that lake...population of walleye is about half of what it was in the 80's because of the clear water....that lake ""was"" a tea stain lake that was NYS walleye factory at one time.....fishing is MUCH tougher now 30 years later."

680546,mike rousseau,2012-03-27 15:04:00,4661,  i miss some aspects of the old ways... but do you think those conditions made you get less fish per year? or just force you to catch them in different ways/areas?
680549,Joeytier,2012-03-27 15:09:00,3990,"Filter feeders like zebra mussels have greatly reduced biological productivity in the great lakes, which has had a massive effect on trout and salmon, which some others touched on in the Ganny thread much better than I could.  However, walleye and bass populations seem to be flourishing, which be attributed to many other factors, like warmer average water temps..."
680564,Headhunter,2012-03-27 15:48:00,5703,"I can only relate my experience fishing Quinte in the fall... since the arrival of the Zebra's, the fishing has become much more difficult as the number caught have dropped considerably. It was not unusual to catch a couple of dozen fish per outing... fast forward to today and that number would have you on TV! HH"
680574,mike rousseau,2012-03-27 16:01:00,4661,  do you think there are less fish...?  or just harder to catch em?  i noticed they seem to stay below 50 feet most days up there now... ive heard they used to hold a lot higher in the water column... like most fish were above the 50 foot mark...
680576,chris.brock,2012-03-27 16:07:00,4053,"Often when a fish community undergoes a major change (like the intro of zebra mussles)some species will do well in the short term but their populations may not keep up at those levels. I think you need 10 to 15 years to see how the fishery is affected after the change. Enjoy the good fishing, that's cool you're doing well.  I still think all invasive species are bad for the long term. Once they are established, they are probably there for ever and we couldn't remove them even if we wanted to."
680580,mike rousseau,2012-03-27 16:19:00,4661,  it seems like the zebra muscles have started to balances themselves out a bit here... what i mean by that is 15 years ago it was hard to find a rock that didnt have zebra muscles all over it.... but since the water has cleared up so much... i dont think they have as much food and muscle populations are dropping... at least here anyways....  but it seems just as the muscles started to balance out and species adapt... then heres the goby... boy was that a game changer... smallmouth fishing changed drastically in about 3-5 years.... our old patterns and spots that would produce 20-30 smallies a day....now we might get 4-5 doing the same milk run... but those who have adapted for the smallies(im not one of them....) have done amazing and a record breaking tournament bags wave been weighed in in my area...  hopefully we dont have to deal with any more unwanted guests in the near future...
680595,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-03-27 16:52:00,0,"it's very difficult to quantify the impact of the zebras on fish because there are all kinds of factors contributing to the changes in the ecosystem.  i've heard a lot of anecdotal comments that the mussels have decimated the perch fishery in some spots around here but i'm not convinced that wasn't anglers themselves.  anglers are always quick to blame fisheries changes on anybody but themselves whether it be natives, commercial fishing, cormorants, zebra mussels, sea lamprey, habitat degradation, water levels dropping etc.  the reality is that our changing fisheries are a result of a myriad of factors that our government doesn't put enough money into studying.  and between the cutbacks planned by mcguinty and harpers all out war on the scientific community i think things are going to get worse before they get better."
680596,ehg,2012-03-27 16:52:00,2666,The zebra mussels have definitely changed the way of fishing on north Pigeon Lake where i frequent over last 20 yrs. Sight feeders like musky and smallmouth have flourished there. Walleyes that have more sensitive eyes are much deeper or are buried in weed growth. Walleye catch frequency has dropped but larger ones are caught occasionally.
680605,mike rousseau,2012-03-27 17:17:00,4661, yeah... a lot of people around here blamed zebra muscle for the perch fishery taking a nose dive... but then they closed the season during the spawn...and set a limit... and they made a bit of a comeback...not like it was...but better then where it was heading...  bananas to think it was ok to for a pack of boats to keep as many perch as they wanted whenever they wanted... everyone just thought there were so many fish it didnt matter how many they kept... that was just the mindset...
680610,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-03-27 17:29:00,0," that's the mindset of many catch and kill anglers.  they forget that when they point the finger at natives, cormorants, zebras, etc they have 3 fingers pointing back at themselves."

680618,Harrison,2012-03-27 17:55:00,2202,"20 years ago you could troll a #7 shad rap in the back of Mohawk bay and smash walleye in the spring.  Try that now.  There are a ton of variables, but speaking walleyes the fish have moved deeper and have become more weed/cover oriented.  IMO.  Not uncommon to catch walleye now out of really thick weed, even slop mats.  I did a post here on how we fish walleye out of the thickest weed with flipping jigs a year or two ago.  Edit - Found the post, almost 2 yrs to the day http://ontariofishingcommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=42144&st=0&p=449986&hl=harrison&fromsearch=1&&do=findComment&comment=449986  Lake Simcoe is another example.  On a calm sunny day you can see bottom in 30 ft or more and you can now fish weedbeds in 20ft of water in the main lake.  I am hoping this will help the largemouth fishery in the main lake.  I've been catching more of them in my weed smallie areas.  AS for the B Of Q, fish must be moving in and out deeper then they were before."
