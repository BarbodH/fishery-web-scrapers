We are just starting our ladder operations on the credit this Tuesday but it looks like its going to banner year on the credit, best run in 20 years.  Rich."
680084,chessy,2012-03-26 02:59:00,610,we will be lucky to see 6500 .. we now have small mouth bass in the river ...
680460,Paulus,2012-03-27 02:41:00,522, I heard they were seeing them at the Credit as well. That's the earliest I've seen them. A couple of years ago I was astounded to find them in the river already - on APRIL 25th ... not MARCH! Holy sunuva...  Looks like the steelies are definitely going to avoid the slaughter this year  p.-
