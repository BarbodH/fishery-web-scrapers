As always, plenty to see – including five deer, nine turkey, numerous ducks, and a red-tailed hawk.  My time in the fresh air and expansive land aroused some thoughts. Many of us have grown accustomed to photographs, calendars, books, and magazines showcasing nature in it’s finest – and mostly live – state. Many don’t see the other side. The struggles that take place each and every day. The side of death.  I came across many scenes of death in the woods today. Skeletal remains, bleached by the sun, and strewn haphazardly about. Turkey feathers piled high after being ravaged by a predator. With each animal I came across I pondered how they met their fate. Were they unable to endure the cold temperature and deep snow of winter? Old age? Coyote ambush?  I counted four separate remains of deer today. Two turkey piles were also discovered. I’m sure the woods held many more. But with death comes life…and in some ways, a simple and peaceful beauty lies in it all.                    Cheers,  Justin"

I wouldn't want to grabbed by a hawk, have at least 4 talons stuck in your back.  Then be ripped apart alive back at the nest.  It aint pretty."
