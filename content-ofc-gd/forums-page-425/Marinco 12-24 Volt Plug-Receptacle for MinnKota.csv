I have a Marinco 12/24 Volt Plug and Receptacle.  On the Plug there are 3 terminals 12V, 24V and -, So do I connect Red(Pos) to 24V and Black(Neg) to -? I have also read to tighten the 12V.  On the Receptacle there are 4 terminals A-,A+,B-,B+ Do I connect the Red(Pos) from Batt A to A+ and Black (Neg) to A-?  And Red(Pos) from Batt B to B+ and Black(Neg) to B-?   Thanks Rick"

681843,DRIFTER_016,2012-03-30 02:26:00,10439,Rick I just used the wiring diagram that came in the package when I wired mine up. I believe you are correct in your assumptions about the wiring though I would check against the diagram.
