681001,bigbuck,2012-03-28 14:13:00,2449,I'd also look at what a new prop would cost. Repairing props can be just about as expensive as just buying new these days.
681007,vance,2012-03-28 14:30:00,719,I have used Rayplex ltd in oshawa before with good results. 341 Durham street 905 579 1433 just down and across for the oshawa center. you can see the large prop on the roof from Stevenson. he also sells new michigan props.  vance
