Not sure about these brands.Where do you get replacement parts? How easy are they to get. What the hell is Coleman thinking? The boat IMO,is terrible.The gauge is way to thin,and the workmenship is brutal.   Cell phone pics.Sry.    Shakespeare motors???        Coleman 4 stroke.    I will give them credit.They are trying to expand their fishing department.Nothing high end,but better then it use to be. Pricing on the other hand? I,ll leave that up to the buyer."
680691,davey buoy,2012-03-27 21:33:00,5505,"Didn't see the motors at the north store,but picked up some power pro line and a couple of lures on sale.Never heard of those motors.The motors pricing seems somewhat in line for horsepower anyways."
680692,misfish,2012-03-27 21:38:00,29133," The north store is more geared to the hunter.The south,to the fisher Dave"
680695,davey buoy,2012-03-27 21:49:00,5505," Well I'll be damned,never new that."
680697,Rattletrap2,2012-03-27 22:06:00,1652,Who do you think makes the motors?
680699,davey buoy,2012-03-27 22:16:00,5505,"I would think one of the big players,trying to grab a little more of the market."
680703,Nipfisher,2012-03-27 22:21:00,2449,Selling the boats here in North Bay too Brian. Not sure about the motors but I am going tomorrow so I will check it out.
680735,HTHM,2012-03-27 23:37:00,4082,The motors look like re-branded Tohatsus in my opinion.
680737,SBCregal,2012-03-27 23:40:00,688,"looks that way to me, too"
680751,pics,2012-03-28 00:09:00,1268,"The prices seem a little high for an ""off brand""....but then again Canadian Tire usually has good sales which would make it a better deal."
680761,dave524,2012-03-28 00:20:00,4508,"Love the V-HAUL  if the motors are Tohatsu/ Merc clones, price looks good"
680770,irishfield,2012-03-28 00:26:00,26272,Must have hired the advertising firm that doesn U-Haul to do their ad campaign !!  Definitely looks like a Tohahtsu in sheeps clothing.
680788,ohhenrygsr,2012-03-28 01:08:00,947,"Who cares about the boat and motor, how much was the power pro sale lol"
