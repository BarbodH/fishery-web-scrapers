But our plans got cancelled so I made it up buy taking her late evening / night fishing!  What a blast.  I put the little glow sticks on her float and she absolutely loved it.  She could see the bites and totally freak when the light disappeared.  If you haven't tried panfishing at night with the little ones, give it shot!  Just thought I would share.  Phil"

681235,Harrison,2012-03-28 21:59:00,2202,"Give it a shot all, it's worth taking them out at night.  The glow sticks are the key I think.  I hear you on the wife part Ryan.  You have to word it right. I told the misses, There is ice 3 hours from here and I can go ice fishing with her or take her down the street in the late evening. It wasn't an issue after that.      Thanks Gents, lots more to come and on Canadian Waters. We are just getting started!  Not all with my ugly mug in them either."
