I've put this on the roster thread but if we don't get 4 more sign ups, we can't assign the people who want to be on a team signed up.  If anyone is interested, please sign up.   Thank you.    Also, those teams who have decided on a name, please PM me the name if you have not already!  Thanks  Joey"
