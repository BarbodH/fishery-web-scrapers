678346,siwash,2012-03-22 00:27:00,683,"  Not closed off to the idea... it's just that I know that a few guys love pics.. how's the pike? Send me the info, I'd appreciate it...don't forget I love bush chickens so a logging road should be close by in an ideal world!"
678358,michigander fisherman,2012-03-22 01:09:00,64,Check out Pasha Lake Cabins. They have a cast and blast package for fishing and hunting for grouse. The lakes have perch walleye pike and multiple species of trout including splake. http://www.pashalake.com
678372,siwash,2012-03-22 01:36:00,683, looks amazing but too far for a 4 day trip coming from T.O.

678657,siwash,2012-03-22 23:28:00,683,"  I got in touch with the Wilson Lake people. Turns out they have an email! It was kind of buried in the website...   Anyhow, they are away so they have to get back to me about details... the owner was emailing from Mexico.   Seems that it is a quite a bit cheaper than Herridge.. I just can't seem o find any info on the lake and whether it is any good to fish for walleye... anyhow, I've narrowed the selection down to about 5 places! Hope to make a decision soon..."
678726,Rod Caster,2012-03-23 02:27:00,5784,"Wilson has walleye. If you decide to go there, send me a pm and I'll give you some info about the immediate area."
681096,kennyblackmax,2012-03-28 17:46:00,4,"Mar Mac Lodge on Esnagi Lake is accessable by VIA railfrom Sudbury and has Waleye Pike Perch Whitefish Brook Trout and Lake trout. Esnagi Lake is 27 miles long and is completely remote. At the south end of the lake by the railroad tracks there is a trail that is not used by motorized vehicles ever. The Grouse hunting is phenomenal on this trail, and the fishing is fantastic. In September they offer some great discounts and the owners are Candian and have been on the lake for over 50 years.  Hope this helps"
678044,siwash,2012-03-21 01:09:00,683,"Hi folks,  Been ages since I post last.. A group of 6 to 8 friends and family are planning a trip in Sept (20-23) and we're looking for a great fishing camp with decent cottages and boat rentals. A few of us are grouse hunters and since the season will have started by then, we'd like to do some hunting too... We'd prefer to keep the drive to within 5 hours +/-.. 6 is possible if it's a really good spot. So far we are considering Herridge Lake, GoBushKon (Gowanda?) Outpost Lodge, and Maiden Bay Camp and maybe Lake Air (seems a bit pricier)  Thoughts on these places?  Any other places? I'd really like to get on some trails/logging roads for some partridge!!  As for fish, walleye, pike and bass would be great and trout a bonus..  Thanks.. I'd very much appreciate the input!  "
678045,Joeytier,2012-03-21 01:14:00,3990,"Talon Lake might be a good option.  Cheaper than some of the options you listed, and I doubt you'd have a problem catching walleye and pike.  The only thing easier is the grouse hunting.  Talon Lake Lodge"
678047,Rod Caster,2012-03-21 01:18:00,5784,lots of good trails for partridge hunting near Herridge Lake lodge. Also plenty of walleye spots out there.
678048,irishfield,2012-03-21 01:18:00,26272,"Mind being water access?? (only 3/4 mile from town) If you don't.. I may be able to set something up for you on Lake Temagami.. 3 bedroom cottage, boat rental from the guy that looks after the cottage (fully insured and legal boats) and a possible guide for the grouse hunt, if Jim's still in town by then.  Hopefully I'll still be there at that time of year and could do a couple Laker charters for you as well."
678049,solopaddler,2012-03-21 01:27:00,8605,"Check out this post of mine from last September.  I know this is a lot further than you wanted to go, but honestly it was amazing.  My buddy who is an avid hunter said it was by far the best bird shooting of his life.  Nobody up there hunts them, the population is huge and what really blew him away were the amount of sharptails.  According to him he has friends that fly out west to hunt them and this experience was better.  As far as the fishing goes it was fantastic. The cabins are decent, prices are cheap and the hosts John and Karen are great.  VERY highly recommended!  http://ontariofishingcommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=58242&st=0&p=637672&hl=Nakina&fromsearch=1entry637672"
678056,siwash,2012-03-21 01:47:00,683,"  Wow, that looks amazing... but how far is that? We only have 4 days - maybe need closer to week for that place. Im saving that in my favs.  Thanks"
678057,BillM,2012-03-21 01:49:00,17367,"13hrs to Nakina one way.  Not really a place you go for 4 days unless you REALLY enjoy driving, lol."
678058,siwash,2012-03-21 01:49:00,683,  Send me a PM of email me at [emailÂ protected]  Pics and more info (rates) would be good... who owns the cottage?
678061,siwash,2012-03-21 01:52:00,683, Do you need to hit those back lakes they advertise or are the walleye (and other species) abundant in the main lake (Herridge)? It gets pricey once you add trips to the back lakes... you have to go with guides...  Thanks!
678065,irishfield,2012-03-21 01:59:00,26272,"I almost bought a place on Herridge, to rent out .... and found out the main lake is pretty fishless. Papa Joe's takes you to the back lakes to fish. That said... maybe it's only ""fictitiously"" fishless."
678069,Rod Caster,2012-03-21 02:07:00,5784,"I find the lakes in that area impossible to catch anything during the day...but the mornings and evenings are top-notch for walleye.  It might be worth guiding into back lakes, or pick another nearby lodge/lake. How about Olive the Lake? Good pike in there. At least you'll catch something during the day....plus it's a bit closer of a drive. Wilson Lake cottages is another option. I have no idea what the cottages are like, but the lake gets almost no pressure from the public because there is no public access."
678071,irishfield,2012-03-21 02:10:00,26272,"Wilson is also a stocked, year round, Laker lake."
678077,Rod Caster,2012-03-21 02:20:00,5784," the one on roosevelt rd is. I've been meaning to hit that this year.  The other one is on Wilson Lake Road, north of Gramps Bait. Lots of nearby trails to hunt grouse too."
678083,siwash,2012-03-21 02:32:00,683,"  Where are these places, fellas? Same area? I'm getting confused!!"
678087,Rod Caster,2012-03-21 02:43:00,5784,"Olive Lake is just north of Marten River. Wilson Lake and Herridge Lake are further north by maybe 20 or 30 kms. All three just east of Hwy11.  If you go to Wilson, let me know...I've been meaning to try that lake...with access The only public access is down a 30 foot rock cliff or through a swamp.  "
678089,siwash,2012-03-21 02:52:00,683,Anyone familiar with this area and lodge?  http://www.gowbushkon.com/index.php/directions-location.html   Thanks...
678091,siwash,2012-03-21 02:53:00,683, For sure!! I am thinking it might be less pressured therefore better fishing... Does it have walleye too?  I am going to shoot them an email..  Thanks Cody
678094,Rod Caster,2012-03-21 03:02:00,5784,"  The lodge owners told me the walleye fishing was ""ok""....they also knew I was looking to launch a canoe...which they don't want. The walleye fishing will be good in there, I'm very sure of that...if the other nearby lakes are any indication"

678338,siwash,2012-03-22 00:07:00,683," Thanks anyway!  Is it true that Temagami can be tough to fish, especially if you don't have a guide or are unfamiliar with it? Might be to big of a lake to tackle for first-timers..."
678339,irishfield,2012-03-22 00:12:00,26272,"Sounds like you're not interested in Temagami now anyhow, but if you are I may have another spot pending how many are in the party and what sleeping arrangements would be.  Sure it can be a tough nut to crack for pickeral.. but bass are under every piece of wood or rock."
