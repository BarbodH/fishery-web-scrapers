680176,fishnsled,2012-03-26 15:19:00,3520,"Congrats Chad!!  All the best to you and your misses.  The Couples Resort sure does look nice but as you said, a bit pricey. Friends of mine stayed there and loved it."
680181,discophish,2012-03-26 15:29:00,392,Congrats to your engagement!  Very exciting.  I hear Sir Sam's is a cool place to indulge  Have a blast!
680348,Rod Caster,2012-03-26 23:05:00,5784," Sir Sam's is who I chose! Good price, good reviews, good ammenities...good, good, good! Can't wait!   I'm lucky to get three weeks off .. the third week is reserved for canoeing/camping.   Thanks Brian! Tapatoo seems to get lots of good reviews as well   Working! haha, otherwise she would have been there. Thanks!   yup, quite a few around Haliburton..that's where we are going. Sir Sam's!   Thanks Mikey! You'll also be the one to teach them how to spool mono..   That place looks amazing...but nearly double the cost of the other places!   Thanks Will! Pricey indeed...maybe for the silver anniversay haha   Thanks! That's what we chose... they don't have any fishing boats and I've never fished from a sailboat haha"
680364,wormdunker,2012-03-26 23:25:00,1711,"Hey Chad, I just remembered the name of the resort on the south shore.  Tama Kwa (spelling?).  It's probably in your back yard"
680369,Rod Caster,2012-03-26 23:27:00,5784," NIce looking place. Not quite what I'm looking for, but if they could guarantee I catch a Musky like the one they have on their website I might reconsider. hahah  "
680377,solopaddler,2012-03-26 23:36:00,8605,"I just thought of Obabika just west of Temagami. There may not be a finer drive-to resort in the province based strictly on ammenities and cuisine.  They have honeymoon packages as well, although they're not cheap.  http://www.obabika.com/experience-obabika/experience-obabika.html"
680381,Rod Caster,2012-03-26 23:43:00,5784, Sold out for 2012! Must be a nice place.
680382,EC1,2012-03-26 23:45:00,930,"Congrats there buddy! No help from me in terms of lodging, but I'm sure you'll be having a great time. Cheers, Edwin"
680387,solopaddler,2012-03-26 23:54:00,8605," Ooops sorry, I never noticed that and it's right on the website!  Blue Moon Retreat near Barry's Bay is nice:  http://www.bluemoonretreat.info/Blue_Moon_Retreat.html   Northridge on Lake Bernard is also highly regarded among my yuppie friends LOL!  http://www.northridgeinn.com/"
680394,Big Cliff,2012-03-27 00:09:00,6899,Have you tried Viamead? It is beautiful!
680601,Dara,2012-03-27 17:09:00,3052,Fox lake is pretty nice.  http://www.foxlakeresort.ca/fox_lake_%26_spanish_river_outfitters_006.htm
680615,Rod Caster,2012-03-27 17:36:00,5784," Thanks Edwin   Nice looking place and the price is inline with the others of that caliber. Thanks for the idea. And they have pigs haha, cool   Nice looking lodges...I'd love to vacation out that way, maybe for the second half of our honeymoon. The first half is gonna be a ""pamper and spa"" type thing.  As per her request. The spa sounds good but I'm not looking forward to them putting diapers on me..."
680648,cityfisher,2012-03-27 18:57:00,959,ive been to sir sams a couple times on my quad  .... Its a really nice place! love the area  Congrats
680754,Leecher,2012-03-28 00:11:00,7832,That's awesome Chad    Congratulations to the both of you
679754,Rod Caster,2012-03-25 14:31:00,5784,"Well, I locked her down! I'm getting married in August to the girl I love  We've been together for over 2years and we are nearing 30. Although we feel the time is right, time wasn't really a factor, because I would have married her at 19 if I could have.  Here is the hubby-to-be with the bride-to-be.    So I've already asked the big question but the second biggest question hasn't been answered yet. What species are we fishing for on our honeymoon?  As for a honeymoon, does anybody have recommendations for resorts in the following areas? North of Bancroft, Haliburton, along highway 60 area, huntsville, east of Hwy 11 all the way to North Bay and any area with a couple hours of North Bay? It'll be late August.  I've looked at ""Couples Resort"" in Whitney and it looks great with great reviews...I'll be calling them soon. I'm just looking for other comparitive resorts that offer lake-side lodging for couples.  As always, I appreciate any advice.  Chad"
679757,lew,2012-03-25 14:35:00,12766,"Can't help you with the resorts Chad, but congrats on the up-coming nuptuals."
679766,gino,2012-03-25 14:48:00,400,"WOW Chad that's a great news!!! Congratulations !!! I read some time ago some good reviews about ""Couples Resort"", still haven't been there...maybe next year with my wife. Anyway, enjoy your honeymoon and God bless both of you!"
679771,Joey,2012-03-25 14:55:00,9122,Congrats Chad.  Can't help on the resort front tho.  We usually camp or get a cabin in that area!
679778,mike rousseau,2012-03-25 15:15:00,4661,Congrats...  I'm in the same boat... Getting married in 2 weeks... And we want to go on an early summer trip as a honeymoon... But having a hard time finding something we will both enjoy... Me fishing...her...I don't remember...I wasn't listening...lol  We are leaning towards a trip to the adarondacks in NY state... Only an hour or 2 away from us... Great fishing...hiking...shops...  Other then that I can't find a place we will both enjoy...
679779,Tybo,2012-03-25 15:15:00,1373,I can`t remember the name and I believe it`s on Ox tongue lake.It`s a couples resort. No screaming kids running around.
679787,mercman,2012-03-25 15:35:00,7054,"Another one bites the dust...............  Just kidding Chad !!! Congrats to you both.Maybe a Walleye cruise with Mike,and me too . The 3 girls could come shopping in Montreal as we fish.    Just a thought"
679789,Nipfisher,2012-03-25 15:42:00,2449,"Hey buddy, Congratulations for you and your fiance."
679829,adempsey,2012-03-25 17:03:00,1498,"Whole bunch of possibilities listed here: http://www.400eleven.com/getaways-romantic.html#quietbay  I've been to some of the larger places like Red Leaves and Taboo.  They are nice and have good food,  but are also very big and busy.  If you want to golf though, these types of places are great.  Anyway, I thought these two looked nice.  http://www.cedargrove.on.ca/index.htm http://www.trilliumresort.com/"
679832,Dozer,2012-03-25 17:19:00,896, Congrats bud
679836,Rod Caster,2012-03-25 17:28:00,5784," Thanks Lew   It's expensive there...but it's a 5star resort!    Thanks Joey It's a nice area no matter what room you sleep under.   Don't remember, wasn't listening hahaha. We wanted to stay close by as well. The wedding is in Bancroft so I figure we'd pick a place that is en route to North Bay.  Good luck and congrats to you too, Mike    Thanks Tybo, I'm looking into Oxtongue right now...   C'est romantique dans le bateau a Mike? haha She REALLY likes the idea of a walleye cruise!   Thanks   Great sites! Thanks, that'll give me some good ideas. I really like SirSam's...so far it's number one on my list.    Thanks"
679844,irishfield,2012-03-25 17:42:00,26272,Congrats Chad! Life's just so much more enjoyable with a good women by your side!
679870,TJQ,2012-03-25 18:42:00,7806,Congrats!! No too sure of resorts down that way...
679884,solopaddler,2012-03-25 19:27:00,8605,"Congrat's!  If you're looking for a couples resort, why not try The Couples Resort?  This place is pretty highly regarded:  http://www.couplesresort.ca/index.html"
679902,ketchenany,2012-03-25 20:11:00,3229,Working with tourism stuff couples is the way to go.I put their ads in our magazine. Taboo and Deerhurst  The new one on the block is JW Marriott on lake Russeau  Congrats
679910,Handlebarz,2012-03-25 20:22:00,3790,Another great very smart woman she knows what her prioritys (how ever ya spell it) are.  She loves her alone time so she was looking for a fishing nut noting better as she does not need to worry about you cheating because she will know where you are by the seasons.  Congrats hope you find a great place to spend her honeymoon
679924,woodenboater,2012-03-25 21:07:00,2277,"You want the Greenwoods cabin at Blue Spruce Resort on Oxtongue Lake. Been going there for I don't know how many years but never stayed at Greenwoods, always booked. Want a hot tub, check. Sauna ? check. It's separate from most of the cottages so it's a bit quieter.  The Haydens are super great folks and run a wonderful place all year. Nice bass fishing in Oxtongue and close to Algonquin Park and Huntsville.  damn, forgot to say congratulations !"
679929,Rod Caster,2012-03-25 21:30:00,5784," Agreed 100%.  Some do, some don't... but I definitly need a better half!    Thanks   Hehe, it's the first one I looked into, thanks to a google search. It has great ratings and reviews and is the most expensive around; it pretty much stands alone. Horses are nice touch too!   Thanks Ketch, I bookmarked the Deerhurst... you know they have nice facilities after the G8 spending   Thanks Mike! I like this alot, ""she will know where you are by the seasons"".   Look at the Greenwoods cabins...$1,855 for a week. Not bad. Its on my short list. Thanks!"
680090,bigbuck,2012-03-26 03:37:00,2449,"Sir Sam's just outside of Haliburton. Lots of lakes around and its a nice spot. We spent our first anniversary there. Plenty of things to do in the area. You can do a horseback riding trip into Algonquin that was a lot of fun, fishing, golfing, nice little shops in Haliburton....... The food and service are fantastic."
680102,spincast,2012-03-26 09:30:00,3279,"Congrats!. We did much the same thing, got married up there (ended up in Bracebridge;- but no honeymoon due to me running my nealy opened own business at the time and - saved that for 20 years and then cruised Alaska.).  We Looked in Resorts Ontario and found at least 15 spots up there, sent them emails and then picked based on the responses."
680103,wormdunker,2012-03-26 10:13:00,1711,"Congratulations Chad.  There's a nice resort on the south shore of Nipissing (I can't remember the name),  But I think it's off Tillicum Bay Road.  Also Resort Tapatoo off the 400 near Parry Sound."
680120,NAW,2012-03-26 12:10:00,4022,Great news Chad!  Congrets.  I was wondering where she was this year at the G2G..
680123,bigugli,2012-03-26 12:23:00,6138,"Lots of nice places to choose from. Derhurst, Windermere, Domain of Killean, etc.... A number in the Haliburton Highlands that my neice has worked for."
680138,cheaptackle,2012-03-26 13:17:00,849,Miss one day on OFC and look what happens! Chad - who's the guy posing with your GF now Fiancee'?  You know - the clean shaven & well dressed one. Seems to me I had suggested a few months ago that this was imminent! I wish you all the very best with many years of happiness. Just one thing - when the little ones are old enough how about letting me teach them how to cast?  Michael
680140,johnnyb,2012-03-26 13:31:00,3413,"Congrats Chad!  A friend of mine and his wife actually eloped to the Couples Resort....and absolutely raved about it.  They have much higher standards than me, so I figure it has to be pretty good"
