681787,cynmar,2012-03-30 00:19:00,169,I have a very nice Abu line counter reel. Can you use this reel to cast for pike and or Muskie?? Does it screw up the line counter function? I am not a reel officianodo so have no idea. Thanks guys.
681788,Joeytier,2012-03-30 00:23:00,3990,The reel counter should have a reset button...so no.

681796,mike rousseau,2012-03-30 00:34:00,4661,id go easy on it... try not to make burning high speed super long distance casts...  but ive used my trolling rod to cast a couple times...

681933,NAW,2012-03-30 13:47:00,4022,I was thinking the same thing.  I just bought a used combo. and it has an OLD K-Mart reel on it!  I thought it might birds nest if used for casting??
