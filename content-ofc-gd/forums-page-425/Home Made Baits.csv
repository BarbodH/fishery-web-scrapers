Let's see your handy-work!!!   I'll start off with one.    This is a popper I did for one of my friends. It's made of yellow ceader and weighed in just over 2os without the hardware.    Built a shop in my basment with a lathe so I can turn my own plugs now. Need something to do during the winters here.    Getting pretty good with airbrushing layers.    Thru-wired with a 150lb spro belly swivel.    FHR"

681186,Joeytier,2012-03-28 20:30:00,3990,That looks excellent.  Does it have a concave lip for popping?  It's hard to tell in the photo.
681191,Christopheraaron,2012-03-28 20:44:00,3525, I think it does because I can't see an eye in the photos either.
681255,FishHeadRic,2012-03-28 22:47:00,226,"Thanks Glen. Joey, yes it does have one... wouldn't be a propper popper if it didn't!   Roy, It's funny cause I was looking for that exact same post the other day. When I go to my profile and try to pop up my older posts it only goes back so far. I still have one of the swimmers you sent me a while ago. Orange jointed tiger w/ a lexan lip. Do you ever have any issues with your baits swelling or taking on water. Are you sealing them prior to paint?    FHR"
