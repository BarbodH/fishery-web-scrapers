We unfortunately had some bad weather roll in on us which made fishing really tough. 2 out of the 3 days were cold windy and rainy. We had one nice 90 degree day, then the temps dropped to 40 degrees with rain and wind.  We still managed some nice fish but unfortunately none over 10 Lbs... which for Falcon seems to be the bench mark for a 'big' fish hahaha...  Here is a little footage....  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRyRPydpdsQ&context=C49963a0ADvjVQa1PpcFOpP_z0O9YhEv43Fjs6Ci9ta5HpEYTXdt0="

680144,Jds63,2012-03-26 13:47:00,1365,great video ... is this the same Flacon Lake that is becoming notorious for Mexican pirates ? ... did you stay on the US side ?
680191,rippinlipsfishingteam,2012-03-26 15:50:00,76,"  We fished both the US and mexican side.  Yes is 'THE' Falcon lake, however as far as I know there was one isolated incident. However having said that, if you go with an experienced guide down there you wont have a problem. There are lots of border patrol etc out there so not once did I feel uncomfortable."
