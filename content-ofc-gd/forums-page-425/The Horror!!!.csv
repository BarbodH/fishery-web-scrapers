681398,Twocoda,2012-03-29 04:23:00,4130,mathematically the flames still have a chance to make the playoffs but they sure arent making it easy on themselves....lost to the kings 2-0....
681468,Headhunter,2012-03-29 13:07:00,5703,"I haven't been able to watch an NFL game in years... 4 hours to play a one hour game!!! Put a stop watch on the actual time the ball is in play... then you can talk to me about boring! And for those who like to catch a bit of kip while watching sports.. two things come to mind. 1. Golf! Best tv sport to nap to! 2. Woman's curling! Babes yelling ""hurry hard"" does it every time! The NHL playoff picture is starting to clear... it's really too bad that we don't have very much of a Canadian presence this year... still hoping The Peg can find a way in.... that or dare I say, there are multiple plane crashes in the next week, that would put more Canadian teams into the game! HH"
681059,bushart,2012-03-28 16:42:00,2628,According to TSN--in Feb--the Sabres were 10 points behind the leafs...oops

681083,BITEME,2012-03-28 17:34:00,1968,Really.....who cares!
681102,Billy Bob,2012-03-28 17:52:00,5865,BITEME......I tend to agree....find hockey a bit boring and I don't really watch it unless the Sabres make the playoffs....and what sport takes 2 months to play through the playoffs....  BRING on MLB and the NFL.......
681130,Lip-ripper,2012-03-28 18:34:00,228, you find hockey boring yet watch the MLB????? Jesus... I'd rather watch curling
681136,Spiel,2012-03-28 18:55:00,9065,"   Nothing in the NHL will ever affect my daily existence, nor should it!"
681137,davey buoy,2012-03-28 18:58:00,5505, Hi hear you on that one!!
681144,Billy Bob,2012-03-28 19:08:00,5865, Now there's a fun sport to watch....  :rofl2:
681147,Twocoda,2012-03-28 19:10:00,4130, Id rather watch grass grow or wood naturally warp and then after that ....head down to the department store and try on gloves to complete the excitement for the day   GO FLAMES GO!!!!! give me a reason to feel good about getting the new Jersey
681150,Billy Bob,2012-03-28 19:12:00,5865, He who doesn't understand baseball doesn't like the game....it's actually a VERY finesse game that is played with chess like moves when the game is on the line in the 8th and 9th innings.....it also takes the most skill out of all the games to play it.....that is why baseball players tend to play so long in their careers.......GO RED SOX .....
681151,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-03-28 19:14:00,0,  
681156,Billy Bob,2012-03-28 19:27:00,5865," No it's really the skill level that's hard to replace.....take Derek Jeter for example.....been around forever, probably too long for the money he makes but that's another story....up until a year ago he was irreplaceable for the Yankees....  Don't forget these guys play 162 games not including spring training and playoffs if their team makes it...in the NFL they only play 16 games and very few teams make the playoffs....once a week compared to baseball players playing 6 days a week.....sometimes 4 days straight....and of course the older a guy gets the more he's hurt and the longer he takes to recover....  Hockey is not a BAD sport......I just don't like the way it's played in the NHL....the stupid little fights are real boring and just slow down the game......bring back the red line and do away with the blue lines...just a start..."
681157,Lip-ripper,2012-03-28 19:28:00,228," aside from pitching and the odd catch, how does it involve any skill? they run in straight lines!!!  Watch some of the dekes in hockey or even soccer, some of the acrobatic catches or jukes in NFL or even some of the dribbling or dunks in NBA and you'll see talent. MLB players have the most out of shape athletes in any major sport.... except for the ones on steroids!   "
681168,fishnsled,2012-03-28 19:48:00,3520,Just fish people. Get off your 's and fish.
681170,Billy Bob,2012-03-28 19:52:00,5865,  LOL......you have some good points there but not very valid.....BTW great picture of CC Sabathia....he's the most feared left handed pitcher in the league right now.....  If you don't think it takes any skill then you should have no problem hitting a 101mph fastball or maybe the next pitch will be a slider or a hanging curve ball.....and if you could do all of that you would be making at least SEVERAL Million dollars per year....you might even be able to quit your day job....LOL
681219,jedimaster,2012-03-28 21:29:00,3472," Oh no thats not why... Its steroids we all know that. That and the fact that baseball players outside of the pitcher and catcher sit and scratch there arse for 2 hours. Its a pretty low impact game. notice I said game and not sport. Baseball is perhaps the most boring game in the world to watch. If I need a good sleep I'll toss on a baseball game and sleep soundly for 6 hours.  Curling, Golf, Womens beack volley ball.... I would watch any of these over baseball...Heck I may even watch the hotgod eating championships as long as its not being held inside of a baseball park."
681308,Walleye'm Fishing,2012-03-29 00:41:00,310,"I agree 100%. I have a hard time watching the 9th inning of a playoff game. Hey pitchers, throw the ball already!!!   "
681334,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-03-29 01:25:00,0,i love baseball but i am a jays fan so it`s been very love/hate since i was in my early teens.
681338,Dan668,2012-03-29 01:31:00,1120,"Jays looking good so far, as long as no one gets injured, it should be a good year"
681353,limeyangler,2012-03-29 01:52:00,5204,"At least Chelsea have an away goal for their home tie on Wednesday with Benfica, they could and probably will get to the semis, but i think Bayern, Barcelona/AC Milan or Madrid will be too strong for them in the semis."
681356,muskymatt,2012-03-29 02:02:00,2608,"Baseball???? OMG, really? Any pro sport (and I use that term loosely) that 2 games are played back to back on the same night, and no one sweats, is boring and bordering on a ""past time"" and not a sport!"

681365,Lunatic,2012-03-29 02:15:00,536,"2 months of playoffs is what makes the stanley cup the hardest trophy to win in sports. i used to watch most sports growing up,loved baseball but then i actually went to two games....ZzZzzZzzZZzzzZ  what a snooze fest! havent watched a game since. although i later found out watching an episode of the simpsons,my problem was i watched it sober. baseball is fun to play boring to watch."
680708,jedimaster,2012-03-27 22:38:00,3472,"Well I guess it'll be another Leafless play offs. So who is gonna be your team this year? Are you going to pull for the nucks or the sens? Honestly I don't think I can root for either. I like the players for the sens beter than the nucks, but I just can't bring myself to cheer allongside with some of the lunatic sens fans. The nuck fans are no better. I hope after the schmozel from last year the canucks go out in the first round.  I was holdong on for the Jets to get in but that doesn't look like its going to happen either. Maybe calgary can string a few together and make a run for it.  I think I'll have to root for Chicago again this year."
680711,davey buoy,2012-03-27 22:41:00,5505,"No Toronto,I'll be putting my money on Penguins if Sid stays healthy."
680712,Raf,2012-03-27 22:44:00,3495,I'll be cheering for Ottawa's 1st round opponent.  They won't get to the second round so I'll possibly have to figure out a another team then.
680717,DRIFTER_016,2012-03-27 22:56:00,10439,  ME TOO!!!!!
680719,misfish,2012-03-27 23:01:00,29133," IT,S TIME. Sid will  no longer be on the protective list,once the playoffs start. When the time presents it,s self,he will be taken out.    Watch out for the real team,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,BRUINS,YA BABY."
680725,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-03-27 23:21:00,0,"maybe you guys shouldn't be leaf fans.  then maybe you could cheer FOR a team some year, instead of AGAINST teams every year.  it must be hard on your heart to lead such a bitter and unhappy existence every spring.  no expectations of a cup in ottawa this year, but i hope they work hard and gain valuable experience going forward.  the addition of mika zibanejad and jakob silfverberg next season is going to round out the core of what will be a juggernaut going forward.  hell, at least you laff fans will have lots of time for fishing this spring."
680775,Rod Caster,2012-03-28 00:44:00,5784,"worst poll ever haha.  It's too bad about the Jets..they had a chance, but it slipped away. I'll be cheering for Phoenix if they make it...then it's any Canadian team. I wouldn't mind seeing the Blues make a serious run for the cup either"
680799,muskymatt,2012-03-28 01:32:00,2608,"Yup, I guess as a laff fan you have to find something to cheer about! LoL 3-0 wipe out again tonight Go SENS Go"
680801,Joeytier,2012-03-28 01:38:00,3990,"I've really enjoyed watching the Sens play this year.  Super fun team to watch.  People don't actually like Vancouver, do they?"
680802,kickingfrog,2012-03-28 01:39:00,8333,"Seven hundred and nine posts MM.  Some of us also discuss fishing and other topics here.  Give it a shot, maybe you won't come off as such a amazingly insufferable boar."
680808,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-03-28 01:46:00,0,i wonder what percentage of his posts have been about the sens.
680810,Lunatic,2012-03-28 01:47:00,536,sens wont make it either. wouldnt mind seeing the blues go deep.

680835,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-03-28 02:14:00,0, i'll take that bet.
680841,muskymatt,2012-03-28 02:29:00,2608,"Well, let's see! Being that it's spring, and the laffs are out of the playoffs, Muskie is closed, Walleye is closed, lakes are in the ice off transition stage, I would have to say a high percentage of my posts are ""Hockey"" related this time of year. Why? Because if there is one thing that is a constant, it that the laffs will suck! All that said, I do post on nice catches posts, good stories posts, just not on all the NF posts. So, once the Sens are out of the playoffs, the laffs are deep in the bunkers with the sand wedge and Muskie or Laker or Walleye season is open again, I'll post some fish pics! That's if the laff fans can take all the ribbing in stride and enjoy a pic or 2 with another angler, without holding a grudge!"
680878,bushart,2012-03-28 03:07:00,2628,Well the Sens were picked to finish at the bottom of the conference at the 1st of the year---so any playoffs is a bonus
680943,Walleye'm Fishing,2012-03-28 12:21:00,310,"After 9 consecutive years without playoffs, you should be used to the ''Horror'' by now. Actually, it shouldn't really be a horror, it shoud just be life as you know it. 5 years into Burke's tenure and your team has not improved one bit. Brian Burke is a joke. The only reason he won a cup in Anaheim was because Brian Murray drafted Ryan Getzlaf, Corey Perry and company. Look at what he did in Vancouver: nothing, just like he's doing right now in Toronto.  Here's a nice little Leafs joke for ya: My friend who is a Leaf fan left 2 Leaf tickets on the dash of his car. When he returned to his car a few hours later, his windshield had been smashed in and now there were 4 Leaf tickets.  You can also add Robyn Lehner to that list and here are other eventual Senators down the line: Mark Stone, Matt Pumpel, Stefan Noessen, Mark Borowiecki, Jean-Gabriel Pageau....  The Leafs prospects are:     "
