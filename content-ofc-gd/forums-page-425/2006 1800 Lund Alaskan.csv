679265,RangerGuy,2012-03-24 13:32:00,564,Thanks Sinker I will call them today.
679280,irishfield,2012-03-24 14:09:00,26272,The link given by Grimice in about the third post was a brand new Alaskan at Hastings Marine!
679298,landry,2012-03-24 14:55:00,1005,"I think Bay City Marine is an excellent dealer and service center. They know their stuff and have always been very fair with me. I was very impressed when I asked them to check out a concern I had about the motor. They trailered it to the Grand River, water tested it and checked it over in the shop - and only charged me $75 plus my spring tune-up fees for their troubles as they found nothing wrong with it, (and they were correct).  That is an awesome boat btw!!  Make sure you get the extended 5 year warranty on the Merc, (or any motor). I have the same motor and really like it but the ignition coils blew and killed my mother board while under warranty. Saved me $3000! My next motor will be a yamaha 4 stroke or a suzuki 4 stroke (which I have owned already) as you will get waaay more hours out of those models than an opti according to the guys at Bay City. But the opti is quiet, starts in all weather easily and runs fast and is cheap to run, even with the recommended opti oil. Buy the optimax oil in bulk!!  Good luck!  Landry"
679485,Uncle Buck,2012-03-24 22:27:00,1000,"I ordered some parts for my yammy, wasn't impressed with Bay City's service...  Parts will be here in 2 days guy tells me when i ordered the parts...  3days later i call and ask if the parts are in, they tell me tomorrow (2 extra days) I call the next day, it's still not in...(3 extra days)  I asked them when they would be in, he tells me when UPS delivers them...   wasn't impressed... It ended up coming 5 business days longer then i was originally told"
679493,Dan668,2012-03-24 22:49:00,1120,Had awesome service with bay city. Bought a brand new lund last year from them.
679494,irishfield,2012-03-24 22:52:00,26272,"Everyone has their favourite dealer for various reasons. Clarence, Bay City, couldn't even be bothered to quote my boat, nor could DT power sports or Gordon Marine. Bad business sense as far as I'm concerned... someone that wants a custom order.. paid in full.. and not a boat sitting in the showroom on 3rd party financing praying for a buyer. Makes me"
679500,Dan668,2012-03-24 22:55:00,1120," Thats odd. When i said i was paying in full, cash. Every dealer sat me down instantly. (dt, pc..etc) Bay City was the cheapest/most honest so i went with them. (I was also 20 at the time, only one dealer ignored me, i guess he didnt think i was serious)"
679508,irishfield,2012-03-24 23:04:00,26272, Well 3 didn't take me seriously.. cost them 20% mark up on a 80K + tax boat!
679550,DRIFTER_016,2012-03-25 00:14:00,10439, I would have driven up with my new boat purchased from a different dealer just to rub it in their faces!!!    :lol:
679555,kickingfrog,2012-03-25 00:20:00,8333, But it would take you 7 days to drive to those 3 other dealers up there.
679588,DRIFTER_016,2012-03-25 01:02:00,10439," NAH, we actually have several dealers in town. I will be buying my new motor in Grande Prarie AB though because they charge way too much here for them. I'm buying a 115 and 9.9 plus new controls and Smartcraft guages and I can get everything there for the cost of the 115 up here!!!!!"
680560,RangerGuy,2012-03-27 15:31:00,564,"Well, pulled the trigger YEHAA!!  I ended up dealing with Hastings Marine. They aren't the cheapest but they are in the ball park and seem to want to work with me. I'm more concerned with service quality and after sale support than price if they are reasonable compared to other quotes.  I did collect a bunch of quotes last year but we decided to wait until this year. So I only talked to the shops that gave the best from price last year this year. So far other than shops in the US only 1 replied and when I request another with specific options and an apology for not being more specific on the previous request eveb they didn't reply.  Hastings is the only place that gave me a few quotes, so they get the sale  This is what we got coming.  2012 Lund 1800 Alaskan in the Fall Marsh color -I cancelled the wetlands option while it looks awesome I don't feel it's worth $1400 2012 Yamaha 4-Stroke Tiller Yamaha Tachometer Snap on cockpit cover Extra Seat,Post & base 4- Pro Track Brackets. ( I'm hoping to make more myself out of aluminum some how LOL! ) Shorelander Trailer with loading guides and spare tire.  I'm nervous going with the yamaha 4 stroke. I'm not sure what the performance is going to be like. I'm coming from a 89 60HP Johnson on a 17' Ranger Tiller that did 37mph with 2 people most of the time.  I know I won't miss the noise or smoke LOL! but if it's a pig getting on plane I know I won't be happy, I don't expect to do 40MPH but mid to high 30's would be nice.  Super excited to run a new boat! I've read some threads where guys can pole these in 6 inches of water that's awesome for duck hunting.  I'm sure were gonna get a lot of birds this year. Now I got big water and skinny water covered for ducks as I have a Momarsh Fatboy DP with a 7HP stump jumper mud motor in the fleet as well.  Now to start researching electronics.  Thank you everybody for the input!!!!"
680566,Sinker,2012-03-27 15:49:00,8692,"Great rig! I'm not sure what the deal is with the other dealers that won't give quotes. My buddy was treated the same way, and also is going with hastings. They're tough to beat.  i agree on teh wetlands camo. There really is no need. Its more for the hunters than the ducks! Looks cool though... lol   You didn't say what size motor you got? I'm assuming a 90?? I'm sure it will get you up on plane no problem, and you'll love it to death!  You got yourself a great duck machine. Where abouts do you hunt? I'm not looking for your favourite spot or anything, just general area of Ontario. I'm also a hardcore waterfowler, if its duck season, my fishing gear collects dust! I travel all over from the Kawartha's, quinte, lake ontario and down to  St. Clair a few times a season for cans/reds. I'm out from opener, till the last day, twice a week! Its my true passion, more so than fishing!!  I think you did well, and got a very versitile rig. She will handle big water no problem, and like you said, skinny water as well. I'm a tad jealous!! Good luck on the electronics search!  S."
680568,Grimace,2012-03-27 15:52:00,2020,Way to go!   You must be stoked.  Those Alaskan's are really nice rigs.
680575,RangerGuy,2012-03-27 16:03:00,564,"I'm totally pumped!  It's maxed out at 75hp for a tiller and yamaha lists a lighter wieght than the optimax for 75hp.. I'll never understand why they lower the ratings for tillers when most engines in this class wieght the same.  Well the area's I hunt just opened way up ... Also, I can now take both my retrievers with me when in the big boat.  Sinker if you want to see a cool rig go to YouTube and search for TeamClaimer (it's an inside joke LOL!) That's me getting used to the Mud Motor and Momarsh. She's pretty cool."
680617,Sinker,2012-03-27 17:53:00,8692,"Yep, the momarsh boats are awesome! I'm interested in the marsh rat. I've hunted out of one, and they are pretty slick! They're not as good as our layout boat in open water, but in the marsh they are killer!!  The nice thing is you can get them close to where you want to go across the gunnels of the tender boat, then paddle from there. They are also good for retrieving birds in hard to get at spots!  Good stuff man!  S."
680628,lew,2012-03-27 18:12:00,12766,"Congrats on the new rig RG, she sounds like a real beaut.  I also bought my boat from Hastings and they are indeed some good folks to deal with.  Don't worry about that 4 stroke Yammie, your gonna be more than impressed with it."
680632,Raf,2012-03-27 18:23:00,3495,congrats on the boat and you'll be happy with hastings.  i dealt with them on my outboard and all positives from me.
680683,kickingfrog,2012-03-27 20:56:00,8333," Very nice.  I figured the weight difference had to do with the driver sitting at the console, countering the extra weight????"
680764,RangerGuy,2012-03-28 00:20:00,564,"Good to hear from somebody that has purchased from them, thanks Lew & Raf  Thanks guys she's gonna be awesome!  We already have a trip booked to LakAir!  Gonna be a long 6-8 weeks HEHEHE!"
680888,Mike the Pike,2012-03-28 03:18:00,3421,Congrats on your new Purchase RG.  Another tiller on the water    :thumbsup_anim:  MTP
678050,RangerGuy,2012-03-21 01:28:00,564,"Ok I finally found a used 1800 Lund Alaskan that's not sold already. I need some help making an informed descision. This is the forum I know I can get honest opinions.  Seller has agreed to sell it for 17,500 was asking 18,600. This seems way high for a 6 year old boat. I mean last year I got a quote for a 2011 1800 Alaskan tiller/75 optimax for 18,300 + tax with trailer and mooring cover.  Am I being un-reasonable expecting them to come down some more? I've included the pictures below. There is one of the keel I believe is a crack but my contact is saying it's not a crack.  This boat is a 12 hour drive from me so I need to be as sure as possible before commiting.  2006 Lund 18 Alaskan SS in Wetlands camo finish Yamaha 90 4 stroke (Like new Approx. 40 hours on motor) Karavan bunk trailer spare tire trailer load guides VHF radio Minnkota 55# maxxum trolling motor 3 camo seats bimini top boarding ladder transom saver lund mooring cover compass Lowrance 332C color locator/GPS on dash Lowrance X50 0n bow                "
678062,Terry,2012-03-21 01:55:00,14456,"well I would buy new for 3,100.00 and something more, taxes in for a 5 or 6 years newer boat  I would buy new"
678064,kuhaman,2012-03-21 01:59:00,503,I agree. That's a pretty sweet boat though.
678067,Grimace,2012-03-21 02:07:00,2020,"Keep looking.  I found this one within 30 seconds on the net.  It is 5 years newer, never been driven and is only 2 grand more expensive. If you take your time you can find the right boat at the right price.  http://www.boatdealers.ca/newboats/fishingboats/aluminumfishingboats/lund/1800alaskanss/147898/lund-1800alaskanss-new-boat-for-sale.aspx"
678121,fishindevil,2012-03-21 11:39:00,6254,"well here is the other thing that sweet used lund already has all the extra goodies,if you were to buy all those exras for your new boat its 3,000 anyways !!! and its a yamaha 90hp !!!! dont forget to factor in what you are going to add into that new boat and see how much it will cost !!!! that used lund looks like a good deal too me !!!"
678128,doubleheader,2012-03-21 12:05:00,497,"Alaskans are a fine boat but this one is way overpriced IMHO. Two years ago I had a quote for a new 20' wheel Alaskan with a 115 four stroke for $25K. Eight years ago I sold my 8 year old 18' Alaskan wheel boat with 50HP Honda four stroke for $8K. I wouldn't think that boat is worth more than $13K, at least in the US. I'd buy the new one you had quoted."
678136,RangerGuy,2012-03-21 12:47:00,564,Thank you everyone for the input... I don't care for the trolling motor or bow depthfinder so those will need to be replaced anyways.  I haven't had much to post the last couple of years but I know I can always come here for good/interesting opinions on things like this.  I calling today and tell him I need a better price.
678147,krixxer,2012-03-21 13:30:00,274,Can't wrap my head around the cost of boats..... How does 5k of material turn into a 25k on the dealer floor. Oh ya and a 10k motor??? what the hell....
678162,RangerGuy,2012-03-21 14:27:00,564,"Well dealer is refusing to go back to the owner for a better price.  So I'm walking away, I guess the hunt continues."
678183,linweir,2012-03-21 15:52:00,202,Price of that used Alaskan seems good. The outboard is Yamaha 4 stroke (all the way). You also have to consider that Wetlands Camo color costs you extra $1500+. Hunters know it.
678220,blaque,2012-03-21 17:39:00,2419," Youve taken the words RIGHT out of my mouth.......Ive been kickin the idea of a new boat around for a long while, and just cant justify it.  The old saying ""whatever the market will bear"" seems to shine in the case of fishing boats."
678224,DRIFTER_016,2012-03-21 17:54:00,10439, There's a reason I hang on to my 20 year old Fisher. When I bought it in 1991 it cost me $20K back then!!!! Replacement today would be twice that!!! 2013 I plan to repower the old girl.  Out with the 22 year old 2 stoke 90hp and in with a 2013 4 stroke 115hp and a new 9.9 kicker!!!    :clapping:
678266,blaque,2012-03-21 19:22:00,2419," Its still hard to believe 1991 was 20 YEARS AGO!!!!!!!!!!! lol  Your math also puts a little spark under me to think more along the lines of,....""go get a boat now as the longer i wait the more pooched im gonna be""."
678298,Sandbag,2012-03-21 21:13:00,533,Sounds like the boat is on consignment at the dealers...More people wanting a piece of the pie likely keeping the price a bit high.  However....the dealer likely knows what he will be able to command for a price.....especially in the spring.  Good luck with your search  Cheers  Craig
678311,Fisherman,2012-03-21 21:49:00,7201,"I find it kind of funny at times that people expect things to devalue to the amount they are willing to pay.  Don't like the asking price and can't get satisfaction with a bargaining session, c'est la vie.  I remember some prospective buyers(not OFNers) moaning about the price of a piece of equipment (ARGO) I had for sale, the right guy came along and paid very close to the asking price, others lost out on a very reasonable deal.  Again, c'est la vie."
678317,greenfshrmn,2012-03-21 22:18:00,65,Not sure where you live but have you considered calling a Lund dealer such as Hastings Marine and asking them what they have available for your price range?
678367,dave524,2012-03-22 01:26:00,4508," Came across the receipt for my old 1982 18 foot centre console Sylvan the other day, talk about sticker shock  18' Sylvan Rodmaster.... .........................$4995 with windshield , grab rail........................$125 85 Johnson Tnt....................................$2800 EZ Load trailer 2000 lb...........................$1200 ..................................................$9120 sales tax.........................................$638.40 labour.............................................$50 ..................................................$9808.40  One thing that is a deal today is electronics, for what I paid for that old Lowrance 1510 paper graph back then , pretty sure would get you a Lowrance hds-7 today  the motor was a deal, it was an old stock 1980 85 hp, got it for the same price as a current model 70 hp, always glad I went with the v4 instead of the 3 banger.  Drifter, make sure your hull is going to handle that weight on the transom. I know I wouldn't have wanted any more weight back there on my older hull than the V4 that was 310 lbs in the tilt and trim version and a 9.9 kicker, OMC went all the way up to 140hp on that block and weight back then. Hulls weren't designed around 115's that outweighed my main motor and kicker combined."
678415,DRIFTER_016,2012-03-22 04:33:00,10439,"It will be fine. It's an extremely well made boat and it is rated for 125 or 130. It has several braces tying the transom to the spashwell and the floor of the boat. The 9.9 ends up being carried by the side of the boat more so than the transom.  Here's a transom shot of the old girl. You can see the two spashwell braces and the bolts where they attach to the transom. There are matching braces underneath the splashwell that attach to the floor striners/bracing.    Oh yeah, I have my original bill of sale in with the other documents that came with the boat."
678537,Billy Bob,2012-03-22 17:42:00,5865," I can't agree more......got free tickets to our boat show a few weeks ago and took the wife just to kill some time on a cold day.....to replace my boat, motor and trailer (nothing else) it would cost me between 20-22K....for something I paid a even 7K for....and I seen my marine dealer guy there and he asked me when I am upgrading to a new boat....I told him, Fran, at these prices never....  $22,000.00 plus 8.75% sales tax adds up to $23,925.00.....that's a LOT of scratch in my mind.....MAYBE if I lived south ON a lake and could use it almost daily I could justify spending more on a boat then I did on my wifes car..."
678694,Sinker,2012-03-23 01:13:00,8692," Your wife doesn't drive a Tundra??  My boat suits me fine. Its ugly, well used and abused, runs like a top, and doesn't leak a drop. Good enough for me!  S."
678695,Sinker,2012-03-23 01:15:00,8692,"Oh, i meant to add...that Alaskan is SICK! All its missing is a TILLER!!  S."
678756,Billy Bob,2012-03-23 10:13:00,5865, NOPE....but she does take her out for a walk.....
678814,RangerGuy,2012-03-23 14:11:00,564,"Well, after a few days of requesting quotes.. this might not be such a bad deal. LOL!  I'm calling a dealer that gave me quote of 18,000 last year. We'll see what he says.  After doing some more math a new one (current pricings) would be about 9 grand more after tax before Trolling motors, depth finder & batteris OUCH! HEHE!"
678929,RangerGuy,2012-03-23 19:21:00,564,"Yet another update! Last one until I put the money down haha!  Looks like I've been talking to the wrong dealers. Spoke to Bay City Marine in Hamilton and he made me an offer I'm 98% I'm gonna take it.  2012 Lund 1800 Alaskan Tiller (Fall Marsh Color) 75 OptiMax with Big Tiller 1 Extra Seat Trailer with load bunks & spare Mooring Cover  19,400 before tax  Lots of money for an aluminum boat, I can't get over the cost of these boats I never figured a general purpose Fishing/Hunting boat could be so expensive.  Boy, do I have sellers remorse selling my old ranger tiller HAHAHA! Thought it wasn't worth repowering a 20 yr old hull.. THAT WAS A MISTAKE!  Thank you everybody again for the  opinions and suggestions"
678975,Sinker,2012-03-23 20:46:00,8692,"Have you talked to the guys at Hastings Marine? Make sure you do before you pull the trigger. I would call them with your quote from Bay City, and see if they can do better. I bet they can. A buddy of mine is in the market for a new lund as well, and after searching around, he found his best price at Hastings. I know plenty of people with nothing but good things to say about them, and they always seem to have a screaming deal on Lunds, and Yammy outboards.  Does that quote above include any electronics? By the time you add those up, your around $3 grand minimum....for anything decent anyways.  I thought the original boat you posted was a fair price to be honest. I wish I had the cake to spend on a boat right now, because that is what I'd be looking for, only in a tiller. Your better off to get everything in one package, and pay for it monthly, than you are to purchase your electronics your self, and install them. At least if it all comes factory rigged, you get the warranty with it as well.  Good luck on your search, and let us know how ya make out!  S."
