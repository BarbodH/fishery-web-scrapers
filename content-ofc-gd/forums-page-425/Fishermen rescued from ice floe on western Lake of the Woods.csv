681258,rufus,2012-03-28 22:59:00,267,"http://www.kenoradai....aspx?e=3517343  Duh... again.  Apparently there is a dozen quads floating around on a ice flow now. If they go under, it is their responsibility to raise them at a cost of $10,000 or so each. They can't just abandon them because of possible fuel leakage."
681264,Freshtrax,2012-03-28 23:12:00,2215,I will do it for 1000 each with grandpas pontoon boat
681367,tjsa,2012-03-29 02:17:00,1578,"they and all their gear are fine. Read below, they still plan to finish their vacation.  http://www.chroniclejournal.com/news/cp/national/stranded-fishermen-rescued-ice-floe"
681369,danc,2012-03-29 02:21:00,4677,Lots of talk about this on the job here in Dryden today.
681372,chris.brock,2012-03-29 02:32:00,4053,I'm guessing a helicopter rental for a few hours (to get their ATVs) isn't cheap
681381,irishfield,2012-03-29 02:49:00,26272, 3 or 4 grand tacked onto the price of their trip... probably not a big deal compared to losing 60+ grand in machines.
681432,rufus,2012-03-29 12:15:00,267,"The big controversy is should they be charged the cost of their rescue considering that they were warned to stay off the ice in the first place. Personally, I think they should. What do you think?"
681439,rufus,2012-03-29 12:28:00,267,One of the rescued fisherman is quoted as saying that they are used to being stranded on ice flows. Happens all the time back home in Wisconsin. Guys are getting rescued every day back home.
681496,Walleye'm Fishing,2012-03-29 14:13:00,310,"Based on this comment and the constant ignoring danger warnings, yes they definitely should be charged for the rescue.   "
681500,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-03-29 14:22:00,0,i can't wait for the peanut gallery to come out and defend these guys again.
681672,Jer,2012-03-29 20:23:00,1426,I don't think there can be a defence...they seemed to have plenty of cash to rescue their ATVs the next day. Hand'em a bill for the whole operation.
