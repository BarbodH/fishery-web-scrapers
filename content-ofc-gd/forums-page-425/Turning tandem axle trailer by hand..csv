I read on another forum about how putting plastic bags under each wheel makes it easy to turn so I thought I'd give it a try today.  I put 4 bags on the floor, one behind each wheel, and then pushed the boat back so each wheel was sitting on a bag. I then went up to the tongue, turned the bogey wheel and then pushed the trailer tongue to the side and the trailer turned so easy I couldn't believe it.  It would come in really handy for anyone who has to man handle their tandem trailer & boat around in tight places.  Just thought I'd pass this little tid-bit on to anyone who may be interested."
