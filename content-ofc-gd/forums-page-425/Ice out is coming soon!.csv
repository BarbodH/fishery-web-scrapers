Ice has not receded far from our shore as yet...but whats left is pretty honeycombed, another week or so above freezing during the day and some wind should do the trick.    PICS OF IN FRONT OF OUR HOUSE FRIDAY. NOT LONG NOW                                  "

Its amazing how clear the lake is at ice out, this lake is the clour of a Timmies double double as soon as the water is 20' from shore!   LOL....and moments before that the 60lb beast came screaming across the yard full tilt and smacked into the kid broadside sending him flying!"

681082,Blue Lk,2012-03-28 17:34:00,337,"I think the ice could be gone in a week if the temps improve,the last few days sort of put everthing on hold. These shots are from this morning at my place.    "
