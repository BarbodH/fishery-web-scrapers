681140,Nipfisher,2012-03-28 19:03:00,2449,"I picked up one of these combos on sale today. They are advertised at $79.99 on sale for $23.99. 70% off. They are 6'6"" Medium rods. Not a bad price for a back up I can leave in the boat.  Anyone use one of these combos yet? The store in North Bay has about 200 of them left. Here is the link http://flyer.canadiantire.ca/Canadia...&&CityStateZip="
681141,Rod Caster,2012-03-28 19:05:00,5784,Did they have the fenwicks on sale? That's what I'm waiting for
681142,davey buoy,2012-03-28 19:06:00,5505," I saw them as well,looked like a good buy for a spare rod as you said,or for the occasional angler."
681158,Nipfisher,2012-03-28 19:33:00,2449,  I have no lockable rod storage in my boat so having a few rods I can leave in there or let my 9 year old use/drop in the lake is a bonus.
681296,pics,2012-03-29 00:26:00,1268,funny this wasn't moved....
681299,Joeytier,2012-03-29 00:30:00,3990,I can get a good price on Fenwicks at a local shop.  PM me what you're looking for.
681325,Nipfisher,2012-03-29 00:59:00,2449,  Why?
681379,Live2fish85,2012-03-29 02:41:00,1633, He isn't trying to sell something. He is informing people that there are rods on sale.
681405,buckhorn250,2012-03-29 09:48:00,85,"bought 2 last year...both rods snapped at the tip, one while I was loading line. Brought them in for an exchange. Hope you have better luck then I did."
681422,Nipfisher,2012-03-29 11:40:00,2449,"  The composite blank feels a bit fragile. If it breaks, I'll bring it back. If it is my fault, then it is only a loss of $24."
681593,pics,2012-03-29 16:52:00,1268,My post was moved when I let everyone in on some good deals for an online auction...perhaps because some of the mods don't like the retailer I mentioned....I DID end up with a Marcum Lx 5 for $300 taxes in....
681630,johnnyb,2012-03-29 18:08:00,3413,"Might have looked like you were trying to promote another site, or sell something directly through that site.  Any time something like that happens, shoot a message to the mods....they're great.  If they don't answer, chances are you didn't want to hear the answer anyway    It's one of the ways they're efficient, too."
681643,davey buoy,2012-03-29 19:04:00,5505,"  Still saying for a spare rod and reel great price,If there a little flimsy,and you break it off putting on line,well that aint right,I don't care who you are .That there is funny. LOL.In all seriousness take it back."
681661,Nipfisher,2012-03-29 20:00:00,2449,  Actually Davey for a medium rod it feels pretty stiff. It is really light and that makes it feel fragile.
681664,davey buoy,2012-03-29 20:05:00,5505," So do you pass on this,and wait for another sale?,I would of looked at it but I have three cheap spinning reels and rods and that's more than enough for me .I have one good spinning and one decent bait caster I use on a regular basis. This leads me to a post I will ad later."
681706,Nipfisher,2012-03-29 21:20:00,2449,"  I bought one Davey. If I consider all of my rods, (cheap and expensive) spinning and bait casters, trolling set-ups, musky set-ups, pike set-ups, break down rods, and fly rods I think I have close to 20. I really only use about 10 each season so I have began to sort through them.  Our public library runs a fishing program in conjunction with Big Brothers where they will loan out rod / reel combos and tackle boxes to kids so they can go fishing. I have a package of 3 combos and 3 tackle boxes with tackle to donate to the program.   I may also look into arranging a tackle swap and donate funds and tackle to that program and others."
681710,davey buoy,2012-03-29 21:30:00,5505," That's amazing,good for you!!It will bring a lot of joy to the kids who otherwise wouldn't have a chance to enjoy what we call fishing whenever we want."
