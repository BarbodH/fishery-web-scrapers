All the typical answers came up -- fireman, policeman, salesman, etc.  David was being uncharacteristically quiet and so the teacher asked him about his father.  'My father's an exotic dancer in a gay bar and takes off all his clothes in front of other men. Sometimes, if the offer is really good, he'll go out to the alley with some guy and make love with him for money.'  The teacher, obviously shaken by this statement, hurriedly set the other children to work on some colouring, and took little David aside to ask him, 'Is that really true about your father?'  'No,' said David, 'He plays for (insert least favorite team) but I was too embarrassed to say that in front of the other kids.'"
