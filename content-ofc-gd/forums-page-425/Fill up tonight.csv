681084,ketchenany,2012-03-28 17:34:00,3229,Ouch! I don't know which way to bend
681088,Handlebarz,2012-03-28 17:39:00,3790,132 here in Chatham
681097,danbouck,2012-03-28 17:46:00,4380,Does it matter anymore. It goes up or down 5 cents every week anyway
681099,bigugli,2012-03-28 17:51:00,6138,Maybe some oil execs need to take a swim in their own ooze.
681100,davey buoy,2012-03-28 17:51:00,5505," Yes it goes up and down every week,but still inches upwards near the end of each month."
681104,Handlebarz,2012-03-28 17:55:00,3790,So oil goes down gas goes up WTH when things went to$1.50 years ago they said the leater reflected the price of oil per barrel so why not now
681106,davey buoy,2012-03-28 18:03:00,5505," Your right I think the rules have changed.If oil was 95 cents per barrel,we would be paying 95 cents per litre,what happened?."
681115,blaque,2012-03-28 18:18:00,2419,i try not to pay attention to the immediate penny fluctuations. 3 cents a gallon if i were to fill up a 25 gallon tank is 75 cents difference for a $100 fill up (its 4 bucks a gallon down here). Hard to justify obsessing about that when i pull away from the pump to head to the tackle shop and spend $8 bucks on an X-Rap
681117,davey buoy,2012-03-28 18:20:00,5505, $8 bucks for a x rap!!!!where? lol.
681149,blaque,2012-03-28 19:12:00,2419,If memory serves me right......X-Rap Classic at gander was around 8 bucks last time i picked some up
681154,davey buoy,2012-03-28 19:22:00,5505, Most the x raps here are $10-$11 each now
681162,LefroyFisherman,2012-03-28 19:40:00,602,"I've never seen it go down 5 cents dan, always up no matter what the reason"
681165,misfish,2012-03-28 19:46:00,29133,"It,s nice to work only 5 minutes from home.Fishing in any direction from 5-15 minutes aswell."
681248,Tdel,2012-03-28 22:27:00,393,Price here is now 135.9/liter. Went up approximately 4 cents per liter.  Tom
681285,kingofthesteelhead,2012-03-29 00:10:00,140,"cost of a barrel of oil went down $1.92 today and the price of wholesale gas also went down today.680 news said there was no reason for this and we are basically getting ripped off.they always find a new excuse for every increase,will it ever end?"
681287,Marko,2012-03-29 00:13:00,854,As long as we keep on putting up with it they`ll keep on raising the gas prices. Its really that simple. Until 30 million of us stand up in Canada and say enough is enough this will continue
681322,tomO,2012-03-29 00:53:00,363,Went down 22 cents a gallon here the last two days in Ohio.
