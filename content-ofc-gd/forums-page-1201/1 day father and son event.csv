81613,aniceguy,2007-06-09 03:08:00,1094,I was thinking about this all day so I figured Id put it up before I go zzz  How's about this for an idea.  1 day event nothing serious at all dad and son team bass tournament on a small safe lake.  We all pitch in some BBQ stuff....bring our boats maybe even kick in 20 bucks to the pot to donate to make a wish foundation and lets the youngsters show us dads how its done.   Any thoughts or am I in left field
81614,ccmtcanada,2007-06-09 03:09:00,7971,Sounds like a great idea...only problem with me is:  1) I only have daughters 2) I don't have a boat...LOL.  Hopefully others will take you up on this idea...sounds like a great G2G idea!
