81709,fishergirl72,2007-06-09 18:13:00,455,"Well I have finally did something that I have never done before, and that is frying up some great walleye fillets!   Those are the fish that Fishindevil caught when he and ecmilley went fishing last weekend. Shawn did not have enough time to fry them up before he went to work so I decided to have a try at it since I have never fried fresh walleye before. He told me how to do it and left for work trusting me not to screw up.LOL. Well I have to say that I even impressed myself, they turned out GREAT!   Not overcooked and just enough seasoning and coating! Now all I have to learn is how to clean them.LOL. But I made sure I saved enough walleye for Shawn to have the next day!      "

Posting this kind of pictures between lunch and dinner should be punishable to the full extend of an OFC law  . I've almost knocked out myself running to the freezer for last filets. It is not fair BTW, they look delicious  :clapping:"

81728,keram,2007-06-09 20:12:00,585,"Oh my, what a stupid mistake.   I've just noticed that you are from Oshawa too.
