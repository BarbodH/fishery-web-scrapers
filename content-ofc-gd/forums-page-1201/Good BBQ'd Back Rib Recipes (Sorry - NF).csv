80910,fishnsled,2007-06-07 21:11:00,3520,Last year for Father's day I was invited to a friends place for the annual rib cook off.  It's a family get together and the winner has the honour of having their name embroidered on the BBQ Boss Apron.  Being the new guy I had to make an impression.  So after many hours of research I put together a process and ended up winning the contest!    There were a dozen entries and I'll be damn if I didn't win.    I was quite surprised.  So if you would like an award winning recipe I'll send it on when I have a bit more time.

81060,Joey,2007-06-08 02:40:00,9122,"Thanks Gerritt, Rosemary eh, that's not in alot of the ones I've seen.  Bet it adds a nice flavour.  Joey"
82021,douG,2007-06-10 18:26:00,2693,"I've got two racks o ribs, coated with Snowball's dry rub, wrapped air tight in two layers of foil, on the cool side of the barbie.  The temp indicator is showing 275 F, and I'm only using one of the five burners turned down to low.  In two and a half hours, I'll put them directly on the grill to finish with Snowball's bbq sauce."
82072,Nemo,2007-06-10 23:08:00,727,Thanks for the invite dOUG. You lucky Dog.
82110,camillj,2007-06-11 01:24:00,1988,Crap ... I just raided the freezer .. all I could find was sausage rolls .... oh well ... 400 degrees .. and 20 minutes .. I can wait
82159,douG,2007-06-11 02:46:00,2693,"They was good.  Steaming in the foil first, coated in the dry rub, is definitely the way to go.  *burp*"
80646,silveradosheriff,2007-06-07 10:39:00,1025,"Hey Tizfun, when is the next cook-off? (I'd love to come check it out)."
80678,bowshep,2007-06-07 12:25:00,378,"Boil you guys are nuts. Olive oil and dry jurk rub thats it for the ingrediants. 24hours before put your ribs in a plastic bag add olive oil to coat the ribs and the dry jurk rub to coat all of the ribs and let sit for 24 hours. Wrap the ribs in foil, pre cook the ribs in the oven for 3 hours at 150f take them out of the oven remove the foil and do the remaining of the cooking on the grill. Scoring the bone is a good thing and if your not putting all that sauce on it will be better for presintation.  Peace Ken  Ps TisFun  Purple Pig ribs would be the place to eat ribs. They are deffinetly in the top 3 Peters is number one Mine is number 2 lol"
80696,Joey,2007-06-07 13:19:00,9122,"You are all awesome, I knew I could count on you  Thank you, Thank you!!  Decisions, Decisions!!!  Joey"
80787,douG,2007-06-07 16:24:00,2693,"I'm sooooo hungry.  To hell with the pike derby, I suggest a cook off instead.  I love bbq ribs, I really do."
80799,John,2007-06-07 16:50:00,2956," I'm with bowshep on this one. Boiling them may remove some of the fat, but also removes most of the flavour. The best thing to do with boiled ribs is to make soup from the stock...... Oven roasting in foil is the way to go. Same fall off the bone tenderness, much more flavour and what the hay, a little pork fat never hurt anyone.....   I might add a slight slather of sauce on the grill tho'.........    Hey doogle, come through to RibFest in Burlington Labour Day weekend. I would be honoured to buy you a pint and a rack!......  John..."
80806,ccmtcanada,2007-06-07 17:05:00,7971,Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm....so Joey...after you pick your recipe and cook it up I have only one question.  What time do I show up for dinner???
80809,Headhunter,2007-06-07 17:12:00,5703,"Here's my dry rub recipe; 3 parts Kosher salt 3 parts garlic powder 3 parts Paprika one part cayene pepper one part onion powder one part oregeno one part thyme one part basil one part cracked black pepper one part chili powder Combine all the ingredients  PS... this is an AWESOME RUB for wings as well!  Generously rub onto FULL RACKS and wrap and store in the fridge over night if possible.  Grilling: You will be using the in-direct method to cook on the grill. This method requires you to light the BBQ and bring it up to approx. 350degrees. Once the temp is obtained, shut ONE side of the BBQ off. Lay the full racks on the side that's off, stacking the racks on top of each other. (This method does require multiple racks or you can simple cut the full rack in half and stack them on each other that way) Rotate the racks every 20 min to 1/2 hour, putting the bottom rack at the top. Eventually, all of the ribs will have been both at the bottom of the pile and at the top. Continue to do this, until the ribs have cooked through. Feel free to add more of the dry rub, every time you rotate the racks. Should you wish to add BBQ sauce, wait until the ribs are almost done cooking, or the sauce will burn onto the ribs. I have another recipe that does include boiling, but you indicated that you wanted the ""dry"" version and I think this has worked best for me in the past! Good luck Joey... What time should I arrive! HH"
80812,douG,2007-06-07 17:15:00,2693,"John, you just made me an offer I can't refuse."
80822,John,2007-06-07 17:31:00,2956, Then please don't refuse........I will look forward to it...  John...
