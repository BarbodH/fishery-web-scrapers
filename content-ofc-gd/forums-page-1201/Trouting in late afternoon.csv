80618,Danubian,2007-06-07 04:36:00,65,"Hello everyone!  I just spent 2 of my most glorious hours of the season: trouting the Credit. The weather was perfect - a bit of a chill, and felt brutal for ""wet wading"" - and the water swarming with fish. Little trout, mostly... I guess they are little steelhead, but I'm not sure. (Wonder where their older brothers might be.)  [Drumroll...]  Two or three skinny dudes like this one, in the first 10 minutes:    Then three to four missed hits, and then nothing.  Time to move on and admire the scenery...    Changed the spot, but some guys were fishing in my favorite, so I kept on going, back and forth.  Tried some ""wet wading"" - COLD! - but worth a tiny dude:    Moved again. Meanwhile the guys I met before have left, so let's give it a try. Wham! Lots of hits - pretty much 3 to 1 - lots of pictures, but kind of out of focus, and most of them dudes quite tiny.  One in beter focus:   (The poor dude was bleeding a bit, altgough it was just the lip pierced.)  This one is the largest, about 100 times smaller than my carp, but such a ""prrrecious"":    A little trail walk and a bath of fragrance:    All the fish were released quickly to [relative] safety. I was a little concerned about the one bleeding, but he took off quite fast once released. (Others were playing dead for a minute or so.)  I lost the count at some moment, but I think I landed about a dozen, lost and equal amount, and got about 30 or 40 hits.  BTW: Does anyone know what are the wild flowers from my pictures? The yellow ones look like some sort of trillium's cousin, but don't have any idea about the purple ones. They smell like violets, but they're much taller.  The pictures are a bit unfocused and for the close-ups I shouldn't have set the flash, but I wasn't sure if the light was enough. Still learning...  Danubian"
80685,mattyk,2007-06-07 12:51:00,2110,some nice pics. Thanks for sharing.
80687,ccmtcanada,2007-06-07 12:55:00,7971,"This is a great report!! Bly and I like to hit our local trib to catch exactly the sized fish you got!  It's a lot of fun...in an uncrowded trib...listening to nature, the water and watching your float go down.  Ahhh...gotta hit a trib again soon."
80811,Jon,2007-06-07 17:12:00,209,"I think the plant with the yellow flowers is yellow iris.  If so, it is introduced and invasive.  I think that the other is dames rocket, also introduced and invasive.  Jon"
81231,Danubian,2007-06-08 14:21:00,65,"Thank you every one for your kind replies!  Here are some more pictures, this time without the flash.  Two little ones:     I found intriguing how the pattern on the Panther Martin looks so much alike the trout's pattern - and that's the one that produced most hits. Cannibalism? Quite possible.  And a snaping turtle - looks like a creature from another world:  "
81235,mattyk,2007-06-08 14:29:00,2110,turtle pic is really cool.
81319,ccmtcanada,2007-06-08 16:58:00,7971,Those newer pics are great....can really see the colours and markings!  It's so relaxing out on a trib where you are the only one around....seeing the float go down is pure heaven to me!
81407,Fishnfiend,2007-06-08 19:45:00,357,Nice pictures.  I agree that the turtle pic is cool.  I do believe that most fish are cannibalistic.  Biggest eye I caught on my trip up north burped up a 6-7 inch walleye...
81430,TroutSlayer,2007-06-08 20:14:00,64,Great catch indeed!   Congrats.
81590,bucktail,2007-06-09 01:42:00,1857,Rainbow smolts...great sign for the river!
81598,FishFinder,2007-06-09 02:00:00,481,"if thats the Upper Credit, please make sure your using single barbless hooks to not harm the little guys, and it in the regs. Other than that nice smolts"
81631,Danubian,2007-06-09 04:09:00,65," No, it's not the Upper Credit, but I'll try to get rid of the treble hooks anyway.  Most of the fish were just superficially stung, but a very few others got some bleeding, which concerned me a bit, so I'm trying to replace the treble hooks with singles. The only problem is that I'm not sure where I could find some very small rings to attach the hook to the spinner's shaft (Panther Martins).  Any alternative ideas of how to attach the hook? I could tie it in with some stronger monofilament, but it's gonna be hard to do so.  Thanks! Danubian"
81653,FishFinder,2007-06-09 12:31:00,481,I think just pinching down the barbs on the hooks and possibly cutting one point off would do it.
