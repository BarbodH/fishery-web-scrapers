For the honeymoon we are going to cancun for 7 nights, for a little fun and sun, a lot of cold drinks, sight seeing, relaxing, and best of all a charter trip of fishing  .  i also plan on doing a little fishing from the beach and lagoon in the mornings, got the gear packed a 12' telescoping surf rod, a 4 piece ugly stick and some crank baits,grubs and spoons and some in-line spinners.  i hope to have plenty of pics to post when we get back.  best of luck for all you folks heading to the g2g, have fun and be safe.   jason"
