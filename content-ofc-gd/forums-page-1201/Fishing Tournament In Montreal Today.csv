81851,Mike the Pike,2007-06-10 03:48:00,3421,"I entered a tournament with my good Friend GlennK on the St.Lawrence River in Montreal.  The weather was just absolutely perfect barely any waves hot and sunny and the fish were on for my passenger .As for me I got that black furry critter with the white stripe.Luckily our entries were registered as a team  On with some pics.   This is a shot just before the 7am departure time in all 175 boats participated.   This is a shot of the Champlain Bridge and I am sure many of you know this bridge It is one of the busiest bridges that crosses into Montreal everyday.We found out it was closed this afternoon because someone was going to jump from it threatening suicide.We may have caught more than fish today had this person jumped.   My fishing partner and teamate for the day GlennK. If you look closely in the background there is a shot of Wayne zooming by in his new Lund its so fast it appears to be red not Lund Blue   This is our little entries for the three categories for Pike,Walleye and Perch.   A quick shot of the dinks before we released them back into the St.Lawrence.    This is a shot of the winning Walleye of the day 7 1/2 pounds.   This is my OFC pose for the Camera yes I got skunked BUT please compliment me for putting Glenn on fish and I was simply amazing with the net today   This is our friend Danny who caught this 3.5 pound dore(walleye) Sorry about the lousy shot but it was jumping out of Dan's hands when I snapped the pic.   This was the grand prize a 14 foot Princecraft with a 9.9 4 stroke Merc and trailer .This is a draw prize any one in the tourney can win it.That's Glenn hoping he will win it to upgrade from his current 12 foot Princecraft.Some other lucky guy one it (not Glenn)   This is all we won   Some more of the prizes.   Another draw prize.   Well my time came   sooner or later we all get a skunking Could not have had better weather ,a well organized tournament I look forward to next year.  Next weekend we get to do it all over again in another tourny but this time Glenn and I will be taking our son's to a different tournament.  I love fishing :"
81929,ccmtcanada,2007-06-10 13:41:00,7971,"Mike,  The way I look at it, in order to be a complete fisherman, you must have all the skills....and this includes netting fish...LOL.  Fishing with bly, I get lots of practise at it  Too bad about the skunk, but a crappy day on the water beats a good day at work any day!!  Great pics of your day...at least the weather cooperated with you.  I hope you have much better luck next weekend....you have a full fishing season planned it seems!  Cliff"
