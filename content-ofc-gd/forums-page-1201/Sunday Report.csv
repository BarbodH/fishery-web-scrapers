Left the house at 1:00 pm, 2:30 on the water. To make it even more unusual for me I've decided to try some new spots to fill the blanks on the map of my favored lake. I was not disappointed. In about two hrs I've hooked 5 pikes, nothing big so I did not want waste time for pictures. With two of them  I've practised "" long distance release"", looks that I still know how to do it   . One of the remaining three (about 26-27"") went back in to the drink as a reward for good fight   . Last couple (24-24"") decided to stay little bit longer to take part in the fish fry contest  . I've needed little bit time to prepare them for the performance of the lifetime, but no dissapointment here: They took first place on the table.    About 5:00 PM on my way to the launch I was casting from time to time not really paying attention    when I had a solid hit  . After few minutes I've landed this baby (25""). Now, this deserve a picture, and then back to the water.    This catch was completely accidental: 5:00 - sun still high 7' deep bare bottom on ""five diamonds""  I think, I will be fishing afternoons more often"
