81501,FinS,2007-06-08 22:04:00,463,no wonder why teachers get punched out
81503,Tarzan's Jane,2007-06-08 22:12:00,1183,"High blood pressure can kill.  Sounds like this may have been a first time ""weirdo encounter"" for some of your classmates.  If so... a scary one yes when you think that your life will end...but life has so many more of those ""weirdos""..this was a mild one in comparison to ""all"" that is out there.  Poor judgement on his part...maybe he himself is scared.  You seem to have a good head on your shoulders...and you were wise to post this.  Don't get angry nor stay angry...just give it a passing glance and continue on."
81518,aniceguy,2007-06-08 22:59:00,1094,As a Devout Christian Im not even going down this path.  Simpy put though teachers have no place stating these sorts of things and if it was my child who heard this I would be darn sure that the person was terminated asap
81550,ccmtcanada,2007-06-09 00:05:00,7971,"Well, I read up on it...looks like it's gonna happen.  Going to cash all my rrsp's tomorrow and buy me a boat!!! WOO HOO!!!"
81556,keram,2007-06-09 00:09:00,585, Make sure that your insurance covers it.
81564,RobHall,2007-06-09 00:24:00,261,The teacher probably believes in these as well.......      FOTB 
81567,glirw,2007-06-09 00:35:00,200,"This reminds me of the story I read in the news about the guy who was told he was going to die from a tumor within 3 months , so he quit his job , maxed out all his credit cards , spent his life's savings away , only to find out that the doctors made a false diagnosis .  Now he is suing the hospital .  I wonder if these Mayan people are going to do the same thing ?  Gotta love the primitiveness of ancient civilizations, compared to modern ones. Can you imagine where we're gonna be in 1000 years if we keep advancing at the present pace ?  I predict apocalypse via Chuck Norris"
81573,Mike the Pike,2007-06-09 00:45:00,3421,"First of all ask this space case what kind of weed he is smoking ,really screwed up dude; ya like someone said FIRE HIS A_ _..........  The fishing world may end when those damn asian carp get into the great lakes.  Another freak on a power trip trying to rot young minds.  I am glad I don't know him because I would blast him a few words$#^@&^*)*!    MTP"
81586,OhioFisherman,2007-06-09 01:31:00,6623,"Dang, the world is flat, I don`t walk well and I am real close to the edge. Stupid humans! I thought we had the market on wackos cornered!"
81636,lunkerbasshunter,2007-06-09 04:34:00,2585,im so glad my tax dollars pay for your teacher.  why in the world would any grown adult say that to a classroom full of kids unless they have serious issues.  I agree she/he shoudl be fired.
81645,Guest Trophymuskie,2007-06-09 10:25:00,0,If I was you i would stop going to class. And when the principal ask you why; you tell him/her that you only have 5.5 years to live according to your teacher and you're going to spend it fishing and not in a stupid classroom.   LOL
81646,mattyk,2007-06-09 10:32:00,2110,the world will never end!
81672,xrap,2007-06-09 14:21:00,683,"  Not a bad idea, but with only 1 week of school left it doesn't even really matter anymore."
81677,bigfish1965,2007-06-09 14:35:00,3382,"HAve your teacher gift all worldly possessions to you  for the day after the armegeddon. Nothing to lose..all will be gone anyway, right"
81425,xrap,2007-06-08 20:07:00,683,"I know this sounds really stupid but today our supply teacher was telling all of us that we were gonna die December 21st 2012. He told us to google "" December 21st 2012"" and I googled it and thier seems to be alot of links and looks like people are acutally beileving this crap. This teacher is kinda stupid and freaky and I have know idea why he would mentioned it to the class. I think it's fake but alot of people in my class got scared because there seems to be alot of info on it. Just wondering what everyone else thinks about it. Just google, December 21st 2012 and  read some of the articles."
81427,tbayboy,2007-06-08 20:12:00,1497,Please dear god get that teacher fired right now.  Its things like this that make me understand why people pay for private schools
81434,Wes Bender,2007-06-08 20:25:00,105,"Damn, I only have 5 1/2 years left to catch that 15+ lb walleye. I wouldn't mind breaking that new Rainbow trout record too. That looks like fun.  xrap. do us all a favour and tell your teacher he/she is a quack."
81439,Puckhead,2007-06-08 20:32:00,377,"You know how many dates have passed in the last 20 years that the crazies said the same thing?  Anytime you get a date with multiples of the same number, in this case 12/21/12, some idiot somewhere will freak out.  If your a betting man, put money on the fact that Santa will still come on christmas 2012"
81440,Wes Bender,2007-06-08 20:32:00,105,What? You disagree?  Nevermind the rude comment was pulled as well as my statement.  Maybe alittle offensive.. My appologies.
81441,solopaddler,2007-06-08 20:34:00,8605,I agree your teacher had no right to mention anything so off the wall.
81442,gussser,2007-06-08 20:35:00,85,"Also-- If you want to complain, at least spell the VP's name right... Please stick to bashing your own."
81444,Spiel,2007-06-08 20:36:00,9065,....Sorry Wes I'm working as fast as I can.
81446,Bernie,2007-06-08 20:41:00,3190,How do IDIOTS get into positions teaching our children and young people? GEEZ
81447,Golfisher,2007-06-08 20:42:00,586,Don't worry; the Power Rangers will save us all!
81448,urbanangler1990,2007-06-08 20:45:00,933,"too funny, tell him to do LAST MINUTE shopping"
81450,xrap,2007-06-08 20:46:00,683,It was a supply teacher. And the thing is it's a catholic school!! Sorry guys didn't mean to start anything just wnated to see what others think
81451,Riparian,2007-06-08 20:46:00,269,"If it comes up in the top ten google results, well then who can argue with that it must be true..."
81452,urbanangler1990,2007-06-08 20:46:00,933,  stolen licsense
81453,Wes Bender,2007-06-08 20:49:00,105," This is the reason the Ontario curriculum is in the state that it is. If it keeps going this way the next generation has a real problem. In case your wondering, I actually know a little about the state of the curriculum, my wife is a teacher. Before someone else makes a crack, I will say she is a very good teacher and cares about what is going on."
81455,Wes Bender,2007-06-08 20:51:00,105,  No worries here xrap. Apperently I have nothing to do today.
81457,steve_paul,2007-06-08 20:52:00,658,"Cool, no homework worries on Dec 20 then.  More tax dollars being well spent.  This teacher should have a long successful career"
81458,keram,2007-06-08 20:52:00,585, You are very polite SP in your ststement.  For me he/she is a brainless moron and what pisses me most is a fact that I pay taxes to put food on the table for IDIOT of this proporsions ( and they teach our kids???   ).  :dunno:
81470,Kev,2007-06-08 21:09:00,54,"There always seems to be one weird teacher in every school, but that usually just makes things interesting. You just have to know what to listen to and what to ignore. (in this case ignore).  But please don't rope in all teachers with this moron. Being a teacher myself, I hate seeing others saying this sort of inappropriate stuff in class, it gives us all a bad name."
81473,mepps,2007-06-08 21:19:00,1301,I remember when the world ended in 1999...that was wild.
81475,Tarzan's Jane,2007-06-08 21:23:00,1183,"   LOL  me too ...  I was sooooooo sick.  It was the upside down ""count down numbers"" on the Peace Tower in Ottawa that told me ... I had ??? seconds to live."
81478,tbayboy,2007-06-08 21:24:00,1497,And to be fair sometimes things are taken out of context - if the teacher proposed it in the 'here's a fun conspiracy for you' type of context and some students got freaked out well then their idiots on their own and I have a bridge to sell them.  We had a great history teacher in high school who used things like this to open your mind a bit.  If on the other hand this teacher mentioned it as if they really thought it was something the students needed to know about then they should be clumped in with the other crazies (must avoid religious debate thread..so hard....) and not allowed to teach.
81484,gussser,2007-06-08 21:29:00,85,I'll bet NASA isn't calling this rocket scientist ( teacher) soon.
81488,Tacklebuster,2007-06-08 21:33:00,303,"Can you imagine, I have to get a criminal record check just to see my son play basketball, yet these quacks are allowed to teach and preach.  Have no fear XRAP, these dates have come and gone, more than I can remember, and so will this one.  I would inform your parents of this teacher, and perhaps they will inform your principle.  Idiots such as these should be banned from teaching.  It really peeves me that people like this are in positions to recklessly impose their ideologies on the young and vulnerable minds of our children.  Just my opinion, and I better stop here otherwise this is going to turn into one serious rant."
81498,keram,2007-06-08 22:00:00,585," Do not make me laugh. You are asking 10-14 years old kids to differenciate, and get their own conclusion what to accept and what to ignore????. Did I miss something.????    I do not"
