If you fish off the rocky piers (wouldn't recommend it for really young kids as it sometimes requires jumping towards angled boudlers) you can get into the same species above + sheepshead and even the odd monster walleye cruising by.  Might be a little too early for salmon but who knows....  I don't fish for resident trout so I can't help you there.  For an extra 15 min travel, you can fish Rice Lake which has enough small panfish to keep the young ones busy."
