81541,Rich Clemens,2007-06-08 23:51:00,3131,"ominous looking ""BEFORE"" pics ....  hope it wasn't too bad.   Just had a Thunderstorm blow through here a little while ago.  Windy, Thunder, Lightning .... and we're still under a storm watch until 10:00pm tonite.  Tomorrow is to be beautiful ... high 80 and lower humidity."
81543,ccmtcanada,2007-06-08 23:53:00,7971,Great pics Paul!  Gotta love the power of nature...always been a storm lover myself.
81579,bucktail,2007-06-09 01:16:00,1857,in Burlington we had winds that had to be at least 120kph at my house. I havnt seen winds like that in years. Checked Environment Canada and they say the winds only went o 54kph. Must have been in a micro downburst.
81601,bassmaster4,2007-06-09 02:09:00,801,apparently a funnel cloud blew  threw some parts of stoney creek/ hamilton cool pics btw
81602,fatherof3,2007-06-09 02:13:00,1769,Brantford was hit hard in the downtown area and Brant park. Lots of trees down and saw some guy whose porch blew apart. It was pretty messed up. up to 4 funnel clouds were reported.
81616,ccmtcanada,2007-06-09 03:11:00,7971, Problem with environment canada's site is it gives wind speeds at the top of the hour only....the odd time you'll get one that's somewhere in between....but not very often.  The winds here in Whitby were pretty awesome too for about 10 minutes.  It blew my weather station off the roof...pretty impressive since it's been up there for 2 years without any problems!!!
81622,Kev,2007-06-09 03:19:00,54,Those are some gloomy looking clouds.  Nice pics
81623,Mike the Pike,2007-06-09 03:20:00,3421,Well I think it just blew over here in Montreal we got some wind a little Rain some heavy thunder and lightning but I think it may be gone.  I have to say I love my carport I was preparing the boat for tomorrows day on the water and I was sheltered from the eliments.  well hopefully its gone and I won't have to clean up the yard like some of you have.  good night!!!!!!!!!  MTP   Great pics Paul they look evil lol!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
81637,bigfish1965,2007-06-09 05:52:00,3382,JUst got my power and phone and internet back on! Yeah! Lots to clean up over the next few days though. Storm whacked a two block area pretty good but left the rest of town alone.
81658,douG,2007-06-09 13:01:00,2693,"I'll be spending the day with a saw in the backyard,  but first I gotta drag the stuff out of the neighbour's back yard and over the fence."
81772,fishindevil,2007-06-09 23:41:00,6254,Yes it was pretty brutal here in whitb y we had lots of trees down and branches all over as well as power failures all over the GTA....we even got sent home from work about 4hrs early because of no power so it was good i guess.....
