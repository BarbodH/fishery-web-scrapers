81997,misfish,2007-06-10 16:32:00,29133,"Dont anyone worry,I learned my lesson from the last first post asking a question without introducing themselves first.  Welcome cdn dude. Your question is a bit open as there are both larger and small mouth in the lake and there are so many areas to fish.Where will you be heading out of. There are many here that fish it and Im sure once we know where you,ll be heading it will be a whole lot easier to leand a helpping hand.  We here at OFC like to get a little intro from the new members,so feel free to tell a bit about yerself and enjoy yer stay.   How was that CH123"
82002,Mikey7,2007-06-10 16:38:00,2,"Alright, well I live in Mississauga, been fishing for quite a while. Didn't get much action on the lake last spring/summer, so I'm doing what I can this summer. I strictly fish Bass, not really a fan of anything else. As for where I'm heading out on Simcoe.. not too sure yet. Some buddies & I are getting a cottage up there for the weekend. I've only fished there once before and it was a few years back. I don't know the lake too well."
82013,Terry,2007-06-10 17:48:00,14456,lots of small mouth and large mouth  and they are found pretty much exactly where they tell you to look in the bass masters type books.. the more weeds the better for largie and rocks for smallies....iaconelli would do well here   welcome to the board
82022,misfish,2007-06-10 18:30:00,29133,"Thanks for the intro dude.Like terry says there are weeds and rocks and shoals to fish up here.Tubes,spinner baits and jerk baits all have thier place up here and there are many more baits, but you got the three that work for me anyways. Im not much of a bucket guy,but do like to give them a try. Smallies I drag tubes and throw spinner baits.  I got to ask,is that you in the avatar? Cool shirt.LOL   And with that said,Im sure Terry is running right now to buy some tubes.LOL"
82024,Terry,2007-06-10 18:49:00,14456,"Iaconelli  Mike the Ike.............................I think he wore the same old hat for 3 years, cause it's his lucky hat  that's who is in the shirt.............."
82030,misfish,2007-06-10 19:26:00,29133," Hey I only know the Canadian Pros. What happens accross the boarder, stays accross the boarder.LOL"
82036,Carmen,2007-06-10 19:47:00,72,It's been a few years but I've done really well off of Mara provincial park area. Mostly smallies but some nice sizes (4-5 lb). Good luck
82045,Shaky,2007-06-10 20:46:00,25,I have had good luck on the south and east side of Thora Island.
