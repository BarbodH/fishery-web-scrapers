81973,Spiel,2007-06-10 15:01:00,9065,....Just hooked up the boat and now waiting for a buddy to show and we're of to Lake Erie. With any luck I'll have a report when I get back. The target for the afternoon is silver bass but I'd settle for just about anything. It's been to long since I last fished and admittedly I'll be happy just getting the boat wet.  Have a great day everyone.
