81809,nel,2007-06-10 01:54:00,52,I just noticed today that my 2005 mercury 6hp 4stroke is only dripping water from the peehole...there isn't a constant flow.  I've heard that this is REALLY bad...Can someone give me some advice?  a. how do I unplug it? b. did I screw anything else up?
81816,TennesseeGuy,2007-06-10 02:10:00,957,First try clearing the pickup spot with a wire.  A bug may have built a nest in it during the off season.
81970,nel,2007-06-10 14:53:00,52,"I've been using it every weekend since april.  I check it everytime I go out. I'm thinking weeds got sucked up there from last week...either that, or something is wrong.  3 years old and the only maintenance done on it has been oil changes and a new sparkplug.  I guess it's due for a professional checkup..."
81999,brifishrgy,2007-06-10 16:36:00,559,check the intake screen to make sure nothing got stuck in there (weeds ) ... had the hose from the exaust port to the pee hole pinch which blocked the flow ..  could try flushing out from the pee hole .. just need a ballon filler that attaches to your garden hose ... good luck
82003,misfish,2007-06-10 16:39:00,29133," Yep,that happen to me 4 times last year. Boy sure glad I noticed that the very first time.Everytime I head out I check.They can get right up into the hose Nel.Besure to check it out thourghly.A tip,shave down a golf tee and put it in the port when you have it parked."
82008,Roy,2007-06-10 17:14:00,13728,"Keep a two foot length of weed edger  cord in the boat. Once the motor is running, stick the cord down the pee hole...that'll take care of it."
82010,misfish,2007-06-10 17:35:00,29133,"Good advice Roy.I,ll have to do that. Thanks bud.  I may need 3 ft though.LOL"
82090,nel,2007-06-11 00:23:00,52,thanks for the tips.  Where can I buy a weed edger cord?
82104,Fisherman,2007-06-11 00:57:00,7201,"At the weed store   , any hardare store carries spools of it, got a neighbour with a weed wacker?, go scrounge 2 feet from him."
82109,POLLIWOGG,2007-06-11 01:22:00,835,I have one of those bottom walkers that have a few inches of wire on it that I actually caught a fish with once but its main job is clearing the peehole.
