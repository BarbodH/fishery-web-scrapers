81201,Shaky,2007-06-08 13:20:00,25,I'm heading to LSC on Monday for a few days and I was wondering if anyone could give me some tips.  I have fished LSC in July and Aug. but never in June.  Last year I was there the first week in July and had good luck straight out from the Ruscom River in about 17fow.  Stoney Point was good as well.  I'm thinking that it is a little deep for this time of year.  I'm thinking more Pike Creek and Askins in more like 10-14 fow.  I understand Anchor Bay is the best spot this time of year but I would rather stay on the Canadian side.

81334,mpt,2007-06-08 17:10:00,158,Try right out from the Belle River. There's a long hump that holds fish. If no luck there troll to Peche Isl. where they've been catching a few. Check out http://www.michigan-sportsman.com/forum/fo...isplay.php?f=58. Good luck!
