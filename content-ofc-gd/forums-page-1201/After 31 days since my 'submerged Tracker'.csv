81493,Zamboni,2007-06-08 21:44:00,235,"That Optimax is a great engine-a terrific upgrade.....10% more power and 13% more fuel efficient than its closest 2 stroke comp the etec's.  DL this chart for your Cook's bay trip, hopefully keep that boat from getting its first ding. Opens in standard MS photo editor that comes with XP at 25%, blow pages up to 75% and they are good detailed size for printing.  http://www.fileden.com/files/2006/8/22/180...and%20River.rar"
81558,JerseyDog,2007-06-09 00:12:00,190,"""In conclusion, I’m quite pleased with the customer service from my boat dealer. ""  Quite pleased? You should be over the moon! They are obviously running a class operation there. Damn, I think I'm going to stop by on the way up north and leave a little bread behind. Vote with my dollars for those that take the customer seriously.  Good American style service - best in the world!"
81627,fishindevil,2007-06-09 03:39:00,6254,NICE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    GREAT TO SEE A HAPPY ENDING      amazing new boat    cheers
80426,young_one,2007-06-06 20:43:00,620,"The dealer is...   Yesterday, June 5, I finally got my boat back. Prior to me getting my boat, the dealer gave me a Tundra 21 WT to compensate the inconvenience. So really, I didn’t miss much of fishing in May and now my ‘new new boat’ is ready for the summer. Long story short, I didn’t have to pay any extra money, and the rest I’ll point form.  -	Brand new boat, I think the old Tracker Tundra SC was a 03 or 04 model (not 100% sure), new boat is still a Tracker Tundra SC but newer model. (pic A) -	The transom welding is an addition to the stock boat, I was told it was professionally done by a local welding company. (See pic B ) -	The ‘submerged boat’ had a 9.9HP trolling motor and a 150 Mercury Nitro Engine(old model engine, see pic C) -	New boat has a brand-new 9.9HP T.M and a FREE UPGRADED 150HP OptiMax Engine    (Pic D) -	With the new OptiMax, we got the ‘duo-cable’ steering as well. (Better than before, which was the normal steering control) -	The cables and transducer for my HB 997si unit are reinstalled -               Free Auto-bildge upgrade, the stock boat didn't have auto-bildge -	The dealer also generously gave us a free winterization/storage package  In conclusion, I’m quite pleased with the customer service from my boat dealer. Although there were many delays before I got my boat, I understand how busy this time of the year is for boat centres.   I can say I’m a pretty happy customer with this particular boat dealer and they have my full respect for everything they’ve done. If you want to know who the dealer is, PM me.  Done high school this Friday, last 2 exams. Going fishing on Monday, Cook's Bay for some pike. Taking 2 buddies from school to showoff the new boat.   Love to hear some Cook's Bay pike tips.  A Yes, the sticker says ON this time on both sides, not NO.   The Old   B The New   C The engines   Cover   Bow   Transom   Captain's Seat   Please don't steal my boat...   Bad omen of the 'submerged boat'. How symbolic, I should've known.  I know, I need a new floating key chain "
80428,charlied,2007-06-06 20:49:00,584,hope she floats this time
80432,oxcowboy,2007-06-06 20:57:00,544,"good for you,  i guess alls well that ends well.  sounds like your boat dealer is top notch!    now go out and have some fun and be safe on the water.  jason"
80433,BFSC Kevin,2007-06-06 20:58:00,1351,Maybe you should hide it in the garage and chain the whole trailer so no one can have a chance? lol.. nice rig!
80437,easton13th,2007-06-06 21:21:00,371,Congratulation! It paid off in the long run for you! On this next trip don't leave the boat in the water over night  Easton

80448,POLLIWOGG,2007-06-06 21:40:00,835,"I would never had thought they would go that far for you.  Good luck with the new boat.  Can I suggest a name.... ""Molly Brown ""  Naming a boat must be done with a party or its bad luck."
80457,irishfield,2007-06-06 22:03:00,26272,New Orleans is sinkin and I don't wanna swim....  Good deal   ..and who would notice something like that?  Sounds like you were well taken care of and there's nothing wrong with naming the dealer in public for service like that....even though I still say it got swamped LOL
80466,marvin,2007-06-06 22:32:00,37,"Thats awesome man. You see everything turned out in the end. I actually had a similar problem this past weekend with water coming in the boat at high speed.  Problem solved later though. I do have that check list for you and everyone else but I need to get in on my computer. I've been having problems with my home system, when I do that I will post it. Now get out and fish with that new boat. You can leave it in the water but buy some extra plugs to plug everything."
80473,walleyejigger,2007-06-06 22:38:00,876,"nice boat, glad it all worked out, and they owned up with service"
80487,nel,2007-06-06 23:10:00,52,"With that kind of service, I think you should put a plug in for the dealer. Shout out his contact info..."
80495,mason05,2007-06-06 23:32:00,258,Killer ride man!  I too think you should provide the dealers details.  Service like that doesn't come around often.  Corn Nug
80498,sonny,2007-06-06 23:48:00,511,"Well glad to see everything worked out well and cudo's to the dealer you delt with,,,maybe deserves a  well deserved mention,,,i know i would like to know a good dealer that stands behind his product!!!"

80531,kennyman,2007-06-07 01:22:00,737,Glad to hear everything worked out for you young one. Shout that dealers name from the rooftops. Hell. I'd let him put the name on the boat. You should let everyone know where they can get great service   . They treated you well and deserve all the accolades.
80613,lunkerbasshunter,2007-06-07 04:13:00,2585,thats great!  I was wondering what happened to you I remember seeing your big sink post.  Glad it worked out for you!  Cheers!
80641,JFR,2007-06-07 10:04:00,498,"Congratulations on the new ride. Patience and a cool head prevailed. Pleased to hear everythingworked out to your satisfaction. Godd  customer service is a rarity these days, go ahead, put in a plug for the marine dealer, he deserves one,  Enjoy your outing on Friday, and the rest of the fishing season  John"
80654,bigbuck,2007-06-07 11:25:00,2449,"Yup, if the dealer went to bat like that for you, I'd definitely post his name and contact info. There's a lot of marinas that could learn from service like that. Sweet boat and I hope you guys nail tons of fish with her. Good luck."
80658,bpsbassman,2007-06-07 11:34:00,941,"Glad to hear everything turned out so well in the end. Given that I know the new Manager where you dealt and the fact that I used to work for him in another capacity, I'm not surprised at the excellent service you received. As I always say, ""Everybody has issues, its how you handle those issues that differentiates good service from bad"". Now get out there and get that baby wet (on the outside only this time)"
80660,motv8tr,2007-06-07 11:43:00,2587,"Glad it all worked out for you, hope to see lots of fishing reports this summer...  Maureen"
