They had so much fun doing what girls aren't supposed to they brought back 3 more troups with them this year. Archery, pellet rifles and guns, lure making and wood carving. The MNR came down with a canine unit and did a search demonstartion also.  The camp fires and just running through the woods of the Port Colborne Conservation Clubs 3D archery course was a blast for the kids as well. I gotta give credit to Alfred Maranelli and the OFAH for putting this on for the kids for free. We had kids from Across zone J attend and for the first time the rain held off for my tent. At least until it was time to pack up.  Here's a little clip of what the kids do. While at youtube run a search for ""wildniagara"" to see other videos on relative topics. Enjoy.  <object width=""425"" height=""350""><param name=""movie"" value=""  Dan"
