I’m from the Caledon area and enjoy all species but my true love is all types of trout (especially specs). I was going to join the board in the next couple of weeks because my wife and I are expecting our first little fisherperson in the next 7 days but after reading the post by “Steverowbotham” on Barrie specs I couldn’t resist. You guys & gals have a GREAT thing happening on this board, good for u."

I think a nice little fishing outfit would be just the thing for your fishing partner.  Once he/she is old enough ... spend all the time you can, you'll never regret it and only deepen your bond."
