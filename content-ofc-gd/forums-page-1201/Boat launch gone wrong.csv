81714,danc,2007-06-09 19:28:00,4677,"I have no details about where, when or why this happened, but the pictures say it all. This looks like a brand new boat to me. Here's how things started out.    But this isn't supposed to happen. Is it? Check out the guy near the back of the boat in the top right of the photo.    And the aftermath.    "

81736,mepps,2007-06-09 20:31:00,1301,Ouch!!!
81739,tjsa,2007-06-09 20:35:00,1578,"Personally, I think they were just pressure testing the hull,.............................but, I think it failed."
81741,Spiel,2007-06-09 20:43:00,9065,"....Typical, I invent it and someone always steals the limelight....LOL"
81754,Greencoachdog,2007-06-09 21:57:00,8163,"We're not allowed to ""sling"" anything on the job when we fly it with a crane... I wonder why?   I know ""slinging"" boats to launch them is an acceptable practice, but this is the risk you take when doing so. I hope somebody had good insurance!!!  Maybe he will opt for anchored lifting points next time."
81771,fishindevil,2007-06-09 23:36:00,6254,"WELL,thats one hellava way to launch a million dollar boat thats for sure..  ...people always amaze me in their stupidity....."

81805,nel,2007-06-10 01:44:00,52,that's what insurance is for...
81820,pikehunter,2007-06-10 02:24:00,1659,"A crane operator job just opened up!  See what happens when you have too much money, god gets even in a nasty way."
81828,marvin,2007-06-10 02:39:00,37,I'm not so sure there is a stupidity clause in his papers. Who the hell stays in the boat like that anyways. That guy got a rude wake up call when she hit the water. LOL
81841,cisco,2007-06-10 03:25:00,597,"Looks like the back strap caught on the outdrives and the weight of the ship on that strap broke the hull. The entire boat looks toast. ""Hey Clem! I think we can squeeze at least one more lift outta them old straps!  Let's giverr a go!"""
81853,Mike the Pike,2007-06-10 03:54:00,3421,Instant Submarine! Wow I hope everyone was ok.Ouch  $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$  MTP
