They were dragging the lake for a body when we put in there.  It's a nice lake, if you head south past the cottages and then west, there is a huge rock wall with old pictograph's on it.  And though I never checked out the east side of the lake there is supposed to be an old log chute on the east side I think.  If you are taking your girls and a motor boat, pack a lunch in the boat and head south to the portage to Pen lake.  I remember the portage being really busy so my buddies and I had our lunch about half way through the portage next to a waterfall.  I'm sure the girls would enjoy cooling down in the waterfall. As for fishing like I said we didnt fish our way through rock lake.  But we always rent from Algonquin bound and the guy there was always really knowlegeable about fishing Algonquin bound"
