280036,Joey,2008-12-16 00:05:00,9122,"Found this on a website, hope that's what you're looking for.  Fish that can live in both salt and fresh water are called osmoregulators. Salmon is an example.  They hatch in fresh water, swim to the ocean and spend most of their lives there.  They then swim back to their spawning grounds (where they hatched) to lay their own eggs.  They go from fresh to salt water and back again.  They regulate their salt intake through their kidneys and their gills.  Excess water can be lost through the gills and excess salt can be lost through the kidneys."

280119,Fang,2008-12-16 03:07:00,1330,"just in case anyone was interested  potamodromous      fish migrate within fresh water only (Greek: Potamos is river). oceanodromous      fish migrate within salt water only (Greek: 'Oceanos' is ocean). diadromous            fish travel between salt and fresh water (Greek: 'Dia' is between). anadromous           fish live in the ocean mostly, and breed in fresh water (Greek: 'Ana' is up; The noun is ""anadromy"") catadromous          fish live in fresh water, and breed in the ocean (Greek: 'Cata' is down) amphidromous       fish move between fresh and salt water during their life cycle, but not to breed (Greek: 'Amphi' is both)"
280127,Ramble,2008-12-16 03:19:00,713,osmoregulating is how they can deal with different salinity levels. anadromous is the word you are looking for. GCD was all over it lol  -R-
