279574,troutologist,2008-12-14 20:06:00,951,Hey that was you out there?? Me and a buddy only were out for an hour just checking the ice out.  What depth were you getting them in? We only got a small perch.
279611,pike slayer,2008-12-14 21:35:00,1177,"ya it as me and my buddy, we had the old beat dodge dakota and there was 2 other guys that were there before us. the other guys are the ones that keep their camper there all year. the other guys did better then us gettng 5 walleye and 2 whitefish that they took home. the one guy had a honey hole catching probably 10-15 baby walleyes. and perch!?!?! ive never heard of or seem a perch in the tilleys. only walleye, smallies, whitefish, specks, and suckers. yous were thr ones that walked out and fished the upper then left after an hour or so and went to the lower eh? we were getting them deep at around 20feet."
279625,troutologist,2008-12-14 22:20:00,951,"Ive caught a few perch trolling worms for walleye there. We didnt fish lower, I think there was a family that was heading down there just as left. I was surprised there was that much ice there."
