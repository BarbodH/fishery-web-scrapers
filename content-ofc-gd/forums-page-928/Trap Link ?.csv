279868,mikegta,2008-12-15 15:09:00,39,Hey guys  i have a 04-05(product #108054) clam 5600 and i was wondering if anyone has ever  tried to use the trap link with this model and if it works or not. clams website says that the system is compatible with 2005+ clams but i am unsure whether mine would be considered the 04model or 05 model.    any help would be great  thank  mike

279933,mikegta,2008-12-15 17:35:00,39,thanks uncle buck  i just decided to call clam and find out 100% and like you said there has to be a circle zipper in order for it to compatible which mine does not.  they also said i could buy a new tent for 199.99 LOL   thanks for the help mike

I have the trap link system and they work very well when you have a few of them together. You can have one made at a canvas shop for very cheap to fit yours, most times cheaper than you can buy one for."
