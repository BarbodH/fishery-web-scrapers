277357,tschirk,2008-12-09 03:23:00,261,Ok it looks like there is enough interest in this. Let's nail down some logistics. In addition to the date where should we go?  We will need parking and reasonable access to good fishing grounds...suggestions? Cheers Ted

They seem to think everything else is normal so they're hoping to wait till June or July for surgery. So Later would be better for me. If I can make it at all. We'll see.
