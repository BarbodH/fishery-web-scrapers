279902,TennesseeGuy,2008-12-15 16:33:00,957,"Hey Dave, nice post, but how is Sam doing?"
279904,Guest gbfisher,2008-12-15 16:34:00,0,"  I can think of one that went and started his own site, took a bunch of whiners with him and that their site died a miserable slow death......   Ah....gee...Thinking out loud gets me in trouble...."
279916,irishfield,2008-12-15 16:53:00,26272,"Ya.. good 'ol ""what's his name"" !  Thanks for the chuckle Dave... good to see you back.  Now Roy... did ya get your sweeties car runnin bud?"
279941,Canadave,2008-12-15 18:03:00,62,"Thanx Irishfield  Hey gbfisher ... was that site by any chance all about striking muskies?  Hey Tennessseeeseeese ... Sam's doing great although at 13 he's not as fast and frisky as he used to be.  He's never been sick a day in his life and he can still run but not like he used to ... sort of like me.  Now we both run like Walter Brennen.   Unfortunately our cat Maggie disappeared on Labour day so we believe she was likely killed and eaten by a fisher.  The government in their retarded wisdom decided to mess with nature and introduce fishers to control the porcupines and they immediately decided to eat everybodyies cats and small dogs.  In their infinite wisdom they decided to introduce cougars to control the fishers and now they wonder why everybody's dogs, cats, goats, sheep and cattle are disappearing.  We'll be really relieved when the government introduces elephants to stomp out the cougars.  I can hardly wait for the government to raise taxes and throw billions out the window so they can placate the global warming chicken littles and crap artists like Al Gore and accomplish nothing but don't get me going ... unless you want to of course."

280046,musky_man,2008-12-16 00:28:00,159,"Canadave,  Will that be Prozac, valium or lithium?"
280280,Canadave,2008-12-16 17:14:00,62,Hi Gerrit ...  I hope things are better for you now. No one should have to go through what you did.  Time is a great healer.   Musky Man ...  A gallon of coffee seems to work for me.
279890,Canadave,2008-12-15 16:04:00,62,"Hi Roy and TJ !  It's been a long time since I poked my nose in here.  The last time was at some point when some kind of changes were made on the site and it took forever to download which in part may be related to my stupid dial-up although for the first several years I never had the problem.   Also around that time some newbies started whining about rants and started threatening to lodge a complaint with the thought police and it got so ugly that TJ almost closed the site down and as a last resort passed the ball to Speil and Roy knowing that since they don't have a life they wouldn't mind carrying the ball.   Who do you call when you want to carp to the thought police anyway?  Probably Bob Rae.  Now there's a useless turd for you.  Some people think he's a genius and some sort of messiah even though he had to hit 60 before it finally started sinking in that his flavour of the month socialism would never get him to his goal of forcing the unwashed masses to genuflex to his fat ass every day but I digress.   As I recall, the whiners went berserk if any topic didn't relate to stupid fishing and I figured that if you can't rant, cuz that's what life's for, then what's the point.  I prayed to the Good Lord that whoever those whiners were, they would get cancer and die a painful death and rot in hell for eternity.  I noticed that there is some ranting going on here now but it's nothing compared to the good ol' days so maybe the Grand Poo Bah in the sky answered my prayers sorta kinda.   Maybe the whiners left and signed up at www.shitforbrains.com where they can share their miserable lives with other whiners but I digress.   I noticed that a lot of the old regulars aren't here unless I just haven't checked the threads enough.   Good to see that douGUH is still here.  I wonder what happened to DILIGAF?  I guess he was finally committed."
