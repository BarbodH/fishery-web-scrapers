278970,SlowPoke,2008-12-13 06:26:00,2984,"I don't remember if you have internal GPS antenna in the back or if you're running a puck. If you have a puck, you can tap into it with the NMEA bus for signal to the front GPS/Sonar... so, you can buy an LMS520C DISPLAY ONLY for about the same price (or cheaper) than the X510 colour Lowrance sonar... around $350-$400. The LMS520 and X510 have identicle sonar specs. Then use the US2 from the Minnkota for your transducer. LMS520C - Display Only - $369.99  If you don't have a puck.... LMS522 - Portable - $549.99"

279718,icefisherman,2008-12-15 01:09:00,952,"Well I am also on the market for a new color sonar/GPS unit (possibly two screens using the same GPS/Transducer connected together with network and ethernet cables). Similar to Brian's idea but more advanced ;-) I'd suggest all of us who are on the market now to get together and I think I can setup a deal where we all save big....  I did speak to Josh this week but his prices now are not as good as they normaly are, mainly because of the exchange rate.  So, PM me if you are serious and on the market for a new unit and let's work together to save some money (which we'll spend on more fishing stuff) ha ha ha  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
