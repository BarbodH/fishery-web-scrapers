279320,Stern Rules,2008-12-14 05:42:00,342,You must get a pic of them in the tank.
279563,irishfield,2008-12-14 19:48:00,26272,So Paul.. do you have to bring your own bucket to the store to take them home... or do they have a big baseball bat right beside the tank?
279568,irishfield,2008-12-14 19:56:00,26272,
279583,DRIFTER_016,2008-12-14 20:35:00,10439,JEEBAS!!!! Them Carps look NASTY!!!!
279639,hammercarp,2008-12-14 22:41:00,964,That man is right. Those are some pretty sorry lookin carp. But then again the rainbows I have seen in Loblaws and Metro stores don't look all that great either.
279675,Greencoachdog,2008-12-15 00:02:00,8163," ... and you suggest I should lay off the ""shine""... reeeeeeeally?"
279685,hammercarp,2008-12-15 00:13:00,964,I really don't like the way that guy is strokin his eel. Is this what fish porn means?
278756,Clampet,2008-12-12 20:19:00,1947,"Yep, they now have live Eels for sale at the No Frills Grocery store fer $8.99 per pound. They are difficult to see as they are lying motionless at the bottom of the live tank (aquarium) amidst the carp.  Here is the video.. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLhfa6w5MuY"
278761,muskyhunter5150,2008-12-12 20:25:00,64,You got any pics?
278762,DRIFTER_016,2008-12-12 20:27:00,10439,Cheaper to get 'em where you gits yer striper (not stripper) bait.
278767,misfish,2008-12-12 20:40:00,29133,"Awesome fish to eat. Great smoked and with some crackers and cream cheese,with black olives."
278774,Clampet,2008-12-12 20:49:00,1947,I feel I'm being baited. You know I could if I so desired.
278798,Fang,2008-12-12 21:20:00,1330,is this Mavis and Eglington  If so I might have to stop in on the way home.  Looking for something special to wrap up for a buddy of mine. We like to exchange weird gifts at Xmas. I'll bet a live eel will cause some excitement and then we'll get to eat it
278800,Clampet,2008-12-12 21:23:00,1947,No. Creditview and Britannia.
278804,fish_finder,2008-12-12 21:27:00,370, They have battered carp in the live tank??
278807,wuchikubo,2008-12-12 21:31:00,1114," I believe he meant battered as in ""beaten up"" and not covered with flour. Most fish tanks in grocery stores have too many chemicals in them to prevent slimy growth in the tank (also prevents slime from forming on the fish, thus the stress causes the fungus and other problems).  I try never to buy store fish, fresh caught is soooo much better!!  Stan"
278811,misfish,2008-12-12 21:37:00,29133,"Stan, you dont have the best catch and eat record going.LOL J/K Bud   Im howling Clamp. Maybe it,s that BIG full moon. LM AO"
278815,fish_finder,2008-12-12 21:43:00,370, How about the tartar sauce then..... hope they come with tartar sauce!
278819,wuchikubo,2008-12-12 21:46:00,1114," Brian, I guess it must be the bad karma I got for thinking the following statement is so true:  ""Chinese people will eat anything with legs and moves, except maybe for table and chairs.""  and this one:  Q: ""How do you know Adam and Eve were not Chinese?"" A: ""They would have eaten the snake before listening to it.""  BTW I am Chinese-Canadian."
278823,charlesn,2008-12-12 21:51:00,551,They had to move the tilapia because the eels would eat them.  But not even an eel would eat a carp.  lol  j/k  Charles
278838,BITEME,2008-12-12 22:31:00,1969,Nothing is quite like a good fry of eels are they salt water or fresh
278844,misfish,2008-12-12 22:39:00,29133," Hey Stan,my post was not meant to offend. Hope it didnt?  Just got back from Zhers. Smoked eel,1 small 6 inch piece,11 bucks. Hell did a union boat catch it? LOL"
278982,Rich,2008-12-13 08:46:00,3927,"I was given some smoked eel last night and in the spirit of the recent talks I gave it another try (along with some smoked mackerel). Maybe the first batch I had was off or something, this stuff was alright. Like any other smoked fish I guess just a bit greasy. The mackerel was excellent."
279006,hammercarp,2008-12-13 14:02:00,964,Here's a favourite.  Freshly Set Jellied eels   
279014,JohnF,2008-12-13 14:24:00,3494," Aaaaaach! That looks just like what I ate in a sushi bar one night. I thought the round hollowed out thing was a piece of fruit or vegetable with the pit or core removed. It had an odd texture for something that grew on a plant though, so I asked what it was. I almost yakked on the table when the restaurant owner (a friend of mine) said it was eel. Good thing for him I'd already swallowed.  JF"
279038,ehg,2008-12-13 16:00:00,2666,Smoked eel is great! Always getting some from the sushi chefs in my work places. Very healthy source of Omega 3's. Tried it for the first time at a Holiday Inn in Sault Ste. Marie when i was 10 yrs. old.  Unfortunately there is a sense of closed mindedness to these 'no frill' threads.
279079,wuchikubo,2008-12-13 18:20:00,1114," Never my friend.  It's all good.  $11 huh, that's some pretty expensive smoke sauce."
279116,Mark Kulik,2008-12-13 20:32:00,348,"Smoked eel is pretty good, but its quite rich , so you cant eat a lot."
279132,Lungelarry,2008-12-13 21:45:00,294,"If you look at the graph you will see that in 1930 ,1000 tonnes of eels were caught and sold to the European market. Somebody must love Eels http://www.qc.ec.gc.ca/csl/inf/inf052_e.html  "
279176,ScugogBoy,2008-12-13 23:37:00,36,"My background is from ""The Baltics"" and smoked eel is a delicacy...costing around the $20.00 a lb range at my favourite deli......try it with a nice loaf of dark rye bread/sour cream and odd shot of chilled vodka....for breakfast or snack."
279181,Fisherman,2008-12-13 23:50:00,7201,You're making me hungry and I just ate supper...rye bread or pumpernickle with the eel...MMmmmm ...maybe a couple of chunks of pickled heering.
279206,pigeonfisher,2008-12-14 00:40:00,696, Love it.  Nothing can ever get taken out of context...specifically not in the print media.  hahahahahaaa  A nice cold belvedere...just to warm the heart.
