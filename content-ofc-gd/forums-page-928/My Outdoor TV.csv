279613,young_one,2008-12-14 21:41:00,620,"This week I am suppose to study for my finals and such, but find hard to concentrate. Started to watch FLW walleye series on Myoutdoortv. What an interesting show to watch, they show you some of the newest techniques to catch fish, hand lining, split line off planner board, and etc. Myoutdoortv is definitely my alternative to WFN as it has too many shows on repeat!  Im sure many of you know the website, but if you are new to it, check it out! Watching TV can actully be good for you!  ps. Those Ranger Multi-specie series sure looks tough and effective. http://www.myoutdoortv.com/show-microsite-...lleye-tour.html"

279630,BUSTER,2008-12-14 22:27:00,1336,WFN does repeat alot i find..............
279634,Grimace,2008-12-14 22:32:00,2020,I already miss the pwt.    flw is alright i guess.    I am more than a little irritated that the pwt has folded.    I am not going to buy a fiberglass boat either !!   So take that Mr wood.   lol.
279637,GoneFishin,2008-12-14 22:38:00,349,"wow I can't believe I've never found this site before... thanks a lot for the link, I'll be glued to my monitor watching those videos!"
279649,irishfield,2008-12-14 23:05:00,26272,  I hear ya there jedi !! .. but you do know that you can legally drag 4 spoons around on one line in Ontario aye ?
279678,MCTFisher9120,2008-12-15 00:06:00,3761,I've watched a few of the FLW bass series video's on that site. Look for the one on Clear lake there are some HUGE bass being caught!
279711,forrest,2008-12-15 00:55:00,1032," Yep, its a good interface with good quality video.  I saw a few of these already....often it was the local guys that were killing it in run of the mill boats, some of them were salmon guys   .  Not a lot of flash like the bass tourneys.  forrest"
