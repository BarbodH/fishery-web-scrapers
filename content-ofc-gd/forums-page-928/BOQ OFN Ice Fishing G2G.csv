278000,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-12-10 20:52:00,1362, Isn't that the weekend Lakers open on Temagami Wayne???
278008,irishfield,2008-12-10 21:35:00,26272,Issue is Steve... they don't open until Sunday (15th)... which really screws up the working mans weekend !
278014,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-12-10 21:43:00,1362,That's crap!!....what a way to ruin a long weekend!!...I might come up anyways
278111,Hubbard,2008-12-11 01:41:00,22,"I'm in the same boat a Jet, I to do not have an auger or a hut, but I will be willing to atleast make it for the Saturday. Also a guy I work with would like to come but he is not a member, would it be OK if he came out to? Thanks"
278129,BUSTER,2008-12-11 02:20:00,1336,"I highly doubt an auger will be an issue, and hopefully huts wont be of the upmost importance, ive being ice fishing for the day many times  without a hut, ill loan my auger for holes, i can bring a propane heater or 2 and a bbq and i can shuttle some people from parking to gathering spot not everyone but if we all pitch in this can happen cheap and easy, and hopefully not too far from shore..now the only real issue is washroom facilities, again if we pull together perhaps a tent with porta pots or something for the ladies and young ones and guys that ate too much fich and chips...ummm grease!   oh we need to pray to the snow gods for a nice sunny day that will make or break this gathering."
278135,medmart,2008-12-11 02:40:00,587,i'm in who is going to set the date?
279584,nancur373,2008-12-14 20:41:00,1211,If we go off shore a bit I'd hope there'd be a few guys with sleds that would taxi for a fee.
279600,skeeter,2008-12-14 21:21:00,1907,sounds good to me !!!! i will see if i can twist a couple of arms like::: speck chaser and tracker----- hint hint
279605,speckchaser,2008-12-14 21:29:00,17,"Well if Tracker and I join you Skeeter some one might be out in the cold... only got a 2 man portable. I should set it up and see if the mice have made it air conditioned like the previous one I had.So you and Tracker gonna do rock,paper,scissors, for the second chair...lol"
279608,skeeter,2008-12-14 21:33:00,1907,lol tracker has a clam guide im the only one that doesnt have a portable..
279626,BUSTER,2008-12-14 22:23:00,1336,"taxi for a fee, hell no ill pull your azzzz for free"
279645,Dondorfish,2008-12-14 22:53:00,1000,Ya - I'd be interested in a Quinte G2G - and I'll have either the atv or snow machine to assist with rides out ( No Charge ). Its the rides in thats gonna cost yas! lol (joke)   Don  
277275,nancur373,2008-12-09 00:57:00,1211,O.K. I'll get this thread started. Few rumblings around about getting a G2G on BOQ hardwater. Just throwing it out there. If someone else wants to organize it it would be a great gig.  I'm in.  Curt
277291,DT10Sam,2008-12-09 01:26:00,480,"I think this would be a great idea and of course I am in and would like to see everyone once again.  I wouldn't have to go too far either.  Keep in mind not to conflict with Fishing for Tyler as that program would need everyone's support as well.  Regards, Sam"
277292,Terry,2008-12-09 01:26:00,14456,rumble rumble your right there are rumblings...LOL  hey I would be interested......   ain't  much at organizing myself  but do people want to walk out and fish do people want to rent huts do people want to use atvs and skidoos or all of the above.......  a whole weekend or a Saturday.....
277295,nancur373,2008-12-09 01:31:00,1211,"hey Terry, we'll see what most guys want to do. As always there will be some members that can only make one or both days. and however they want t ofish is fine by me."
277298,tschirk,2008-12-09 01:34:00,261,I'm in. I'll bring Sled & portable hut & small BBQ. Cheers Ted
277301,BUSTER,2008-12-09 01:43:00,1336,iam in pending the date?   why not family day in feb? bring the family

277308,BUSTER,2008-12-09 01:56:00,1336,"last year was 18th i think its 16th feb this year..............i vowed to take my kids ice fishing every year since it was a new holiday we hadnt anything to do so now i hope we can keep this up and they;ll follow for years to come, family day = ice fishing"
277313,Beats,2008-12-09 02:13:00,543,"Family day is just another day of work for this guy.  Unfortunately I don't get made up holidays off, certainly wouldn't ever get paid for one.  As it would happen I work for my father, so everyday is kinda family day.  Man, that's a crappy way to have to look at it.  I'd love to hit the BOQ one day, but it's a little far for me."
277314,Terry,2008-12-09 02:14:00,14456,that would leave me out
277321,BUSTER,2008-12-09 02:22:00,1336,many many more dates to pick from ...throw one out there  terry!   how about we agree with a month first   then a date?
277417,e-z-out,2008-12-09 12:51:00,1052,I'm in just pick a date i'll be there.
277470,Dano,2008-12-09 16:08:00,719,"I might be more inclined to hit Nipissing instead, its about the same drive for me and nicer scenery."
277547,raysfish2005,2008-12-09 19:31:00,163,I'll Go..but pick a date my kids dont have hockey......Piss me off stealing all my fishing time....lol
277553,BUSTER,2008-12-09 19:37:00,1336,"car pool dano?  ill drive, ill also leave the kids behind for this one, and i have a sled and double trailer?"
277580,Big Cliff,2008-12-09 20:33:00,6899,"I would do it, any overnight huts available like on Nipissing? I would prefer to go for a weekend!"
277724,Pinch,2008-12-10 00:34:00,231,Im in as long as Im off. I have an atv and a two man portable.
277727,nancur373,2008-12-10 00:37:00,1211,"I'm in the process of building a 2 man portable. And by in the process i mean I have the plans, I just need to buy the materials and build it...lol"
277801,T Fisher,2008-12-10 03:35:00,139,Count me in  Big bay area has lots of early ice and alot of fish.
277915,FLEX ROD,2008-12-10 16:46:00,394,Pick a date and I will have to see what things look like at home.  But I would really do my best to be able to come as I have yet to come to one.  FLEX - John
277949,fishindevil,2008-12-10 18:42:00,6254,"Hey im good to go !!!!...most dates are good,and it doesnt matter to me what location we go to !!!....bring on the winter walleyes...cheers"
277951,Jet,2008-12-10 18:44:00,364,"I'm in as well along with another OFC member. That said, neither of us have a hut or auger. So I'd like to ask if one needs to come with all that stuff to participate? Or will there be a rental facility near by."
277991,FLEX ROD,2008-12-10 20:43:00,394,"JET posted a very good question, as I am in the same possition, I would probably have my 13 year old son with me and possibly my dad also.  Would be willing to share costs.  FLEX - John"
