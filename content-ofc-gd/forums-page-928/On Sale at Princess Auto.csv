279927,Canadave,2008-12-15 17:25:00,62,"The short story is on the ""Car Problems"" thread.  A few days ago I received an email from some site called spoonpullers that even knew I was Canadave and asked me to register.  You guys probably got it too.  I went to it but it was a pain in the butt and took forever but it at least reminded me of OFC so I though I'd drop in. I only checked a few threads and noticed that there are lots of new guys but a lot seemed to have disappeared but I could be wrong.  The wife and I almost went up to Lakair last June but didn't.  I can't remember why ... probably because I'm so cheap.  Anybody know how Kevin and Leslie are doing these days?  With the economy and Canadian dollar I suspect business was down this summer.   A fishing camp on near by Red Horse lake was down about 20% this year but with the U.S. buck up 20 %, hopefully 09 will be better for them. They're good people.  My fishing skills have dramatically improved this year.  I caught two pike.  One was 8 pounds 12 ounces which is the biggest fish I ever caught in my life.  It wasn't all that exciting.  Most of the time I thought I was trying to get free from a snag.  I can't remember if I mentioned it before but last year I upgraded my 40 HP Yamaha to a 50 HP.  I always had trouble starting the 40 which is rare as Yamahas are good motors but the 50 is electronic fuel injected whatever that means and always starts on the first crank.  Another neat thing is that a supermodel bought the house next door but unfortunately she's too young to realize that guys in their 60s like me are actually hotter than young pups in their 20s like her new husband. I figure that by the time she finally figures it out I'll be about 103 and she'll be a prune.    Life just isn''t fair.  I can hardly wait until my next life."
279937,Hooked,2008-12-15 17:51:00,891,"Thanks for the heads up Chris, now I'll be forced to go there tonight to pickup a few.  I've been contemplating getting some for a couple years now, with that price, you can't go wrong."
280073,Fish Farmer,2008-12-16 01:13:00,2234,"CA-Dave welcome back  Hows the Harbor Craft? Long time no hear. Glad you stopped in. Spiel, he's getting OLD, I think he's older than me. The eye's on his pole are getting moldy. Some how, I think the old guy will be calling. Have a good Christmas and New Year Dave."
280269,Hooked,2008-12-16 16:38:00,891,"Looks like I was late, couldn't find any in the store in Hamilton.  Actually, I couldn't even find it in the flyer to show the workers there, cuz they didn't know what I was referring too.  Oh well."
280270,Canadave,2008-12-16 16:38:00,62,Hi Fish Farmer ...  The Harbercraft is fine at least it is now after getting repaired.  Last fall I went down to take it out on a beautiful fall day with the fall leaves at their best for the last boat ride of the year when I discovered that a tree had fallen on it which totaled the windshield.  The insurance covered it but the canvas didn't fit as well after it was repaired.  This fall I was out when the back canvas slipped over the stern and the prop wrapped around it so the back curtain ain't quite as cute now as it was.
280277,Roy,2008-12-16 16:53:00,13728, Maybe your new neighbour has sewing skills.
278504,Spiel,2008-12-12 01:38:00,9065,"....Don't know if this would be handy for all my plastics and power baits but I think I may go and check it out. Anyone familiar with these?

278521,DANIMAL,2008-12-12 02:03:00,215,They work great for packing spinner baits and rigging hooks.
278522,waterwolf,2008-12-12 02:11:00,556,"it's 2 minutes from work ,, $5.00 i'll have a look . great heads up , thanks."
278524,Spiel,2008-12-12 02:13:00,9065,"....Yeah, seems like a good deal. Think I'll go check 'em out tomorrow as a Christmas present to meself."
278529,Rizzo,2008-12-12 02:34:00,4754,"interesting timing, i had people at work today asking me about this thing (guess they all know I fish). didn't look like it would hold too many musky baits so I didn't give it much thought"
278559,GBW,2008-12-12 04:44:00,8460,the bag itself is worth the price to hold lunch...
278565,snag,2008-12-12 05:14:00,1932,"PA rules,  Thanks!!!!!!!!!!!"
278839,Cudz,2008-12-12 22:33:00,2652,I bought 4 of them tonight.  I didn't read the size that posted on the thread.  They are much smaller than I anticipated but they look like they are fairly good quality.  I will use one for spinnerbaits and hooks and one for tubes and jigs
278856,douG,2008-12-12 23:03:00,2693,"To me anyway, it looks like it's about 20 cm square, and 5 or 6 cm thick.  I'm good at guessing fish size too, just ask."
278909,BassAsin,2008-12-13 01:52:00,806,i guess its a good thing the dimensions are on it hahah 2.54 cm to an inch if ya wanna convert and be exact lol
278915,Greencoachdog,2008-12-13 02:00:00,8163, What ever happened to our good friend the decimeter???
278934,pikehunter,2008-12-13 02:57:00,1659,According to the ad the sale doesn't start until Tues. Dec. 16th.
278965,Cudz,2008-12-13 05:41:00,2652,"Well in Barrie they had them on display already and I bought 4 of them.  They had 40 to start with and when I bought my 4 there were 33 left so now I guess there are at most 29 in the Barrie store. Again, they seem alright but a bit small.  I filled them up tonight and they hold plastics well.  I managed to get about 15 spinnerbaits, 4 packs of senkos and some worm hooks in one and about 8 packs of tubes, 20 tube jigs heads and a bunch of grubs and drop shot plastics in the other."
279034,JeffBornFishin,2008-12-13 15:49:00,260, Another proper metric term not used here...like centilitre    How is it you Americans know these funky metric words eh  Got your signing pen ready yet?  I was at PA yesterday and didn't know they had those bags there  didn't see 'em.  I did get what I was after though.  I was suprised to find lower unit gear oil pumps for less than five bucks.  Drove back here and regretted only buying one
279053,superdad,2008-12-13 16:52:00,353,I bought a pair at PA in Kingston yesterday and they had perhaps a dozen left.  Looks like a good way to store the plastic instead of all those little baggies....
279091,Radnine,2008-12-13 19:06:00,1538,"Just bought 8 of them from the Hamilton store (unsure of how many are left). I fully intended to give a few away as Christmas presents only to find that I filled three of them immediately. These are nice by the way. I half expected them to be crap, but they are good ones complete with handle and belt loops. My B-in-L just headed down there so if your in Hamilton you better nip down smartly. Jim"
279128,Canadave,2008-12-13 21:24:00,62,I can't believe it Spiel ... you're still alive.  I thought you would have rotted away a long tome ago.  I guess Roy's dead eh?  He looked pretty pathetic the last time I saw him.
279129,Whopper,2008-12-13 21:30:00,2174,   Speaking of the phoenix
279130,forrest,2008-12-13 21:38:00,1032,Got a few of them for me and local pals....thanks for posting.
279401,Spiel,2008-12-14 14:45:00,9065," .....HaHaHaHaHa, speaking of the dead where you been hiding you old fossil?    No problem, I never did get over to PA to check them out.....DUH."
279406,Roy,2008-12-14 14:50:00,13728,Nice to hear from you Dave. You still using the short bus for your bingo outings?
279449,douG,2008-12-14 16:19:00,2693,"Crap, it's CANADAVE!..Pick any thread with over 4 pages of posts, and let 'er rip.  We've been waiting for this for a long time, Dave."
