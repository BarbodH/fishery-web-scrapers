279338,Greencoachdog,2008-12-14 11:00:00,8163,"It does that early in the mornings Rich, every morning... it's sped up for me in the last few minutes."
279342,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-12-14 11:59:00,1362,Me too guys....I finally had to close the link and then re-open it..
279343,Terry,2008-12-14 12:00:00,14456,many mornings I can't get on this site even once before going to work....been happening for a long time now
279355,Tdel,2008-12-14 13:07:00,393,I have the same problem.  Sometimes the pages just hang there.  I then try other sites and have no problem accessing them.  I usually wait a bit and retry OFC.  Sometimes it will load pages and sometimes it won't.  Only seems to happen to me in the early hours of the morning.  Tom
279358,BUSTER,2008-12-14 13:14:00,1336,same here glad its not just me
279360,lew,2008-12-14 13:18:00,12767,"If you look in the resource section under computer problems, it seems like alot of us are having this same problem lately and it's getting to be a real pain in the butt. I tried to post a little report earlier this morning and it took me an hour for what would normally take a couple minutes.  I don't even bother coming here in the mornings 1/2 the time anymore just because of the aggravation trying to do anything or even read a post"
279369,Greencoachdog,2008-12-14 13:40:00,8163,"Maybe one of the mods will read this and address the problem, after all... they're losing clicks and posts due to this problem!"
279373,Spiel,2008-12-14 13:44:00,9065,....I too have the same slowness issues (insert joke here) as the rest of you. I believe the reason is likely due to server maintainace and upgrades. Perhaps Rick can tell us for sure?
279447,Beans,2008-12-14 16:17:00,3339,"Well, DANG!...What's Dwarfacus gone and mucked up now ???  I don't get on here early anymore so haven't noticed..."
279454,tjsa,2008-12-14 16:23:00,1578,"Well now, I am experiencing the polar opposite of everyone else. I can read posts here easily and fast in the mornings, 4:30ish to 7 am. I have trouble with slow response on this site and others in the late afternoon to early evening. Must be a geographical thing."
279458,lunkerbasshunter,2008-12-14 16:28:00,2585,i have a new mac laptop and use safari and it is faster then i have ever had seen it.  Cheers!
