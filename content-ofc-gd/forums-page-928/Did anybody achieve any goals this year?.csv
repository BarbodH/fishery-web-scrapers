277284,Ramble,2008-12-09 01:13:00,713,"i wanted to break 47 pike of 40 inches in my boat guiding at the lodge this year. I hit 37. The most of any of the guides, but not what i was hoping for. It's a tough number to hit. I still averaged about 1 over 40 every 2 days.  Another goal was to improve on the number of lakers dad and I catch in Algonquin and we hit that no problem and even ended up with a PB twice.  My only other goal is specks through the ice...that's gonna have to wait till after January now. Never got to them last hard water season. I also wanted to ice fish more, and we did pull that off last winter.  Other then that my only goal is to have a good time and I managed that no problem.  -Dave"

I thought for sure I'd have it on Dalrymple with a 5.12 largie, but I got beat with a 5.48 And on Muskoka with a 4.7 smallie, I got beat with a 6.15 largie !!"

277347,pikeie,2008-12-09 03:12:00,380,"well i had quite a good year! not as good as some past, but a good year none the less!  i wannted to learn some new tactics and i did. i started dropshoting more and more on simcoe and it sure paid off! i got plenty of smallies this year over 5 lbs on it learned to use a flippin jig and catch fish when nothing else was working  i caught a few PB's i wanted to break the 40"" mark for pike. never did but i still got my new PB at 37""  when i moved up to sault ste. marie for school i wanted to continue learn salmon and steelhead fishin i caught some new species and some PB's caught my first pink salmon! on the fly as well! i caught well over 200 pink salmon this year! sounds crazy but two times this year i caught over 50 in one day! all on the fly  i caught my first pinook! which is a cross between a pink and a chinnook salmon. they are as aggressive as the pinks but fight like a king. they look just like the pinks but double there size!  i caught my PB king salmon at 39"" over 25 lbs i caught around 90 kings this year! agian all on the fly!!  the steelies are acting very weird this year as there are not many in the rapids as of yet because i have only caught 9 this year but i got my first steelie on the fly which was around 7 lbs and i got 3 more around the same on the fly, the rest were on roe."

280066,BassAsin,2008-12-16 01:04:00,806,wanted to catch 25 LMB over 5 pounds and failed catching 23 and was lookin to beat my cousins personal best LMB of 6.99 lbs weighed in at a tournament 2 years ago weighed it twice and it never hit 7 lbs the largest i caught 6lbs 11oz so she was a cheeseburger away from being 7 but a great season on the water for bass none the less the other was to take one of my less fortunate friends into a lake for speckled trout he has never fished for them before we each caught one over 5lbs out of rubber dinghy's after a 2.5 km walk into this place was and it looked just like paradise and turns out it was.

Plus, I got on to a pretty good spot for eating size walleye that panned out three different times we camped there.All in all a good year.Next year my goal is size,legal size.  Kerry"
280132,Rich,2008-12-16 03:44:00,3927,"Didn't break my PB steelhead or musky, those were tops on the list.  However I did break some other PB's and helped Sugarpacket land a huge list of her PB's. So I'd say it was a very successful year."
280142,forrest,2008-12-16 04:06:00,1032,"I did not set lofty fish goals this year.  It was my first back to fishing year in a while.  1) Keep sane and everybody healthy with the new baby: accomplished. 2) Get the new boat on the water at least 10 times: accomplished 3) Ttroll in Lake O for salmon: Accomplished and caught a few! 4) Fish BOQ: Accomplished but got skunked. 5) Put decent avatar pic beside my name: accomplished  I remember having doubts along with others on the board about MikeTheBassFisher catching anything on those snake lures.  He stuck with it and proved us all wrong, wrong, wrong.   forrest"

280147,BassAsin,2008-12-16 04:38:00,806,the snakes work well if you know of a good lake with some 4+ pound fish they love em'

280208,BillM,2008-12-16 13:37:00,17367,"I met up with some great people this year.  Dave, Sil and Berge are like crack, I really look forward to getting out with those guys, non stop laughs the entire day! (Ok, it was Sil waders that started the whole thing).  Met a few guys off the Grey/Bruce board, one of which I'm sure will be a new fishing partner for many years to come.  Fished more with my dad then I ever have before, this in itself made the entire year.  Countless days out on the water, 2-3 times a week when my oldman agreed with the weather."
280258,LeXXington,2008-12-16 16:19:00,1928,Goal # 1 for 2008 was to catch a whitefish.. still outstanding pushed too 2009 on the ice. (This is a big hint for people who ice fish)  Fish more in lake Erie.. Check figure out how to catch walleye in lake Erie .. check
280303,Canuck2fan,2008-12-16 18:20:00,1444,Didn't set any new goals for this year. I always want to catch as many different species that are in the waters I fish.... I fell short of last years diversity by a walleye and salmon so far in 08. Maybe a late coho can change the salmon part and since I don't ever go walleye fishing I can't really complain about that.  Thing I liked the most about the year is that I did have a great late winter Jan to Mar fishing steel....  Biggest regret is I admit this fall I have been having horrible luck getting hits. I haven't lost one when I get one on though but 3 fish in 14 trips that just has to stop LOL.
277186,MCTFisher9120,2008-12-08 22:18:00,3761,"Did anybody at the beginning of 2008 have any goals or acheivements that they wanted to accomplish this year. I did. I wanted to catch a pike this year and i got my self 2 of them. Another goal i had was to catch a bass at scugog(i did several times). And another goal i had was to use a new bait or technique. I for the first time got to use and perfect using the topwater origional fishing snake, and i got to try out some rapala x-raps. How about you??"
277189,Beats,2008-12-08 22:25:00,543,I intended to finally find a pickerel in the Thames river.  Stopped fishing regularly about 1.5 -2 months ago and by that time had caught 55 all from shore.  Pretty happy with that.

277193,tdotfisherman,2008-12-08 22:43:00,317,"My only real goal this year was to catch a Northern Pike that was over 35"" in length. I figured with the amount of time that I fished Lake Ontario and Georgian Bay, this was a sure thing, instead my largest Pike of the year was 28"", slightly larger than my largest Walleye of the year, which was 27""  Besides that.. this year yeilded my PB Steelhead, PB Smallmouth Bass, PB Largemouth Bass, PB Carp, and my PB Chinook Salmon..  Even though it was a very inconsistant, and up-and-down year, I had some great times fishing, some good catches, and some great times with family and friends either around Toronto, or up at the cottage."

This year I finally succeeded and won it. I also won the Classic for our BPS Series.  This year I won 6 tournaments, 2 championships, and 4 BIG FISH prizes ....  I achieved many goals.

Got to do the latter but the former did not get fulfilled, YET, but not for lack of trying, mostly lack of daylight and time  I did get my PB pike though, 40""er and some other nice specimens so I can't complain too much. Next goal: Catch a Steelhead out here in BC, hopefully in the skeena, or kitimat or a surrounding river/tributary. Glad to hear so many of you did well this year"

Getting her out was the tough part but her catching big bass was too easy, she out did me in the few times she went with some monster bass.  Also wanted to try new water and take as many friends out as I could, both of which I got to do and hopefully next year I will even more."

Not a big one, but who cares.   First day got the Sauger, again a wee one, but firsts are firsts. Actually caught 3 over 2.5 days out there.   Didn't manage to get a black crappie, but my bud did."
