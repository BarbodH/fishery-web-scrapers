279137,Rizzo,2008-12-13 22:07:00,4754,"I have to be brief but just wanted to give the quick update that at least one musky was caught at the G2G on the upper niagara! In all the years I've gone, we've never got anything on the closing week-end but we finally broke that OFC goose egg with a respectable musky. I couldn't make it to the dinner, but I hope to hear other successful reports soon. I'll post more info and a pic in a day or two."

One of the two was caught by walleyemen in my boat today  , and for the record...we lost 3     Walleyemen lost 2 at the side of the boat...too green to net em, soon as they both got to the side of the boat..they opened thier mouth's and out popped his bait  ..and I lost a nice one too....all 4 fish hooked in the same area...hmmmmm wish my wife didn't have to work all day tommorrow....I got half a mind to go again.  anyways not tyinbg up this thread, I will add more later too, just want to say it was a great day out there for a cold December fishin day, and it was a day spent with a bunch of first class people all the way...thanks for joining me in my boat today too walleyemen"

279239,jwl,2008-12-14 02:02:00,1056,"it was great joint effort at the ramps...good job 3-4 of us brought salt/sand for sure...we dumped 2 bags on it and started smashin it up before the whole gang got there, and it still took a bit  and yepper, I figured that would be a good place to stop and fuel up after a day on the water..they feed ya good there for your buck.  Next year Sonny??...I am trying to weasel my way into somehow going tommorrow  , we hooked 4  ,one in the boat   ..by walleyemen...on my lure none the less  I cracked the code by changing game plans a little bit last part of the day..too bad I didn't start like that cuz I was gonna    My stubourness to wrk one small area paid off, I am glad I helped him get into that fish...cool to be part of the first G2G where there was fish caught.
