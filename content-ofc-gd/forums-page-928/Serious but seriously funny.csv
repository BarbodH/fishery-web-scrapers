Seriously, though - they've been making slow-lowering toilet seats for years now.  Any plumbing supply should be able to get them.  American Standard has several models, and other manufacturers pop up if you google slow closing, slow lowering, or soft closing.  Here's a YouTube of one in action.  At least one manufacturer has a seat that not only closes slowly, it closes automatically when you flush."
