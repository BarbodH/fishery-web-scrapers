279622,Rich,2008-12-14 22:10:00,3927,These guys could sure use a bailout.    C'moonnnnnnnn anybody fishin?
279635,gaspumper,2008-12-14 22:35:00,393,ttt
279636,Grimace,2008-12-14 22:37:00,2020,Great picture.    I think he will be fine.    He is just trying to keep his trolling speed down.
279644,JohnF,2008-12-14 22:50:00,3494, Take more care with the drift bags?  JF
279662,Zebco,2008-12-14 23:29:00,123,LMAO priceless...
279665,irishfield,2008-12-14 23:39:00,26272,"Probably a GM motor that threw a rod thru the block.. rupturing the hull Rich.  Gaspumper...  Edit.. Dang.. had another look, it's an outboard. Must have been one of those ""inferior"" offshore bilge pumps!"
279667,ccmtcanada,2008-12-14 23:43:00,7971,"I'll bail them out, but first I want to know how they plan to restructure so they never need assistance again.  I also want to claim a certain percentage of the value of that boat.  Finally, once the bailout is complete, I want to go fishing whenever I want.  Do we have a deal?"
279673,hammercarp,2008-12-14 23:56:00,964,Bailout! Never! I much prefer to tread water. Why would I patch the hole and bail it out. Treading water up to ones neck builds character. Oh and if there are any women and children on board. It's every man for himself.
279723,Rich,2008-12-15 01:17:00,3927," Dude, I can get the government to bail my boat out? Will they set up my bow mount for me too?"
279740,kickingfrog,2008-12-15 01:55:00,8333,Save Our Souls and abandon ship!
279741,hammercarp,2008-12-15 01:56:00,964,No not the gov't but I believe it's in the NDP platform.
279743,SlowPoke,2008-12-15 02:01:00,2984,I didn't think anybody saw that... I told Goran that would happen if we both stood on the same side of the boat!
279765,forrest,2008-12-15 02:51:00,1032,  With some forethought or if they watched where they were going they could have avoided that whole big mess! Let them try to do it themselves first.  forrest
279785,Ramble,2008-12-15 03:46:00,713,"  A little determination and the right attitude can go a long way in such a situation. In the end you end up doing it yourself anyway, no one likes to bail lol  -R-"
279786,Stoty,2008-12-15 03:52:00,2910,"I realize this thread was a joke about the bailout...but....is anyone else SICK of hearing about the dang BAILOUT? Just like ANY other job....if something happens and you lose your job, go FIND ANOTHER. Quit crying about it. Oh wait.....maybe they are crying because they might actually have to WORK to earn money, in the future?"
279791,forrest,2008-12-15 03:57:00,1032,"  The threads on the other bailout got locked for a reason.  This thread is about those silly guys who somehow managed to end up sinking their boat, possibly due to a lack of basic work.  Is there a back story to that pic?  forrest"
279792,Ramble,2008-12-15 04:01:00,713,Yeah....the Rookie forgot to plug the boat before we pushed it down. Then i made fun of him lol. But he sorted it out.  -R-
279809,Zebco,2008-12-15 06:12:00,123,Why are all these people not trolls too Forrest?  Or do you only attack new members?
279816,forrest,2008-12-15 12:20:00,1032, hahahahaha only a troll would post that in the thread... http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_troll  See the first pic in the thread.....those guys might have been trolling with their anchor out.
279880,Blake,2008-12-15 15:40:00,418,Good one Rich I needed a good laugh this morning.
279884,jwl,2008-12-15 15:48:00,1056,"funny about that pic...there is some clause in the insurance for my boat that states the WHOLE boat has to be submerged for the policy to cover any salvage/recovery fees and damages  ,any part of the boat left sticking out of the water and it's not covered.....guess I would be SOL unless I had a big hole ripped in it or something becuase althuogh I would never want to put it to the test, it is rated as level full floatation"
279951,hammercarp,2008-12-15 18:46:00,964,Did AIG have anything to do your policy.
