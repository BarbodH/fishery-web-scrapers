279849,Uncle Buck,2008-12-15 14:24:00,1000,"when you're buying, buy the best of which you're gonna buy, that way you won't have to upgrade in the future..."
279852,trapshooter,2008-12-15 14:34:00,1234,"Go for the 55.  you can get it for $550 right now at riversideoutdoors.ca  I got the 45 and wish I would have just sprung for the extra 100 bucks.  At least with the 45 they have a mail in rebate offer for the soft carrying case (which comes with the 55).  Plus the 55 has a little more peak to peak power.  I used mine on the weekend and loved it.  1/2 inch target separation was deadly.  Marked my minnow and my spoon it was attached to.  It's fast, the display is big and bright and the dynamic LCD display is a step in the right direction for flashers.  Gives an auto depth read out and displays other flasher functions like noise reduction and gain, plus more.  Good luck with your decision.  In the end they all do the same thing."
279874,RickOnt,2008-12-15 15:28:00,669,Thanks Guys  I would need the carrying bag so another + for the 55.  I am gonna call Riverside and find out about shipping costs.  Ben      You are exactly right on the 'All do the same thing'   I have seen many Vex and Marcums in action and they both work very well.  It looks like the Hummingbird will be about the same   but with the added LCD Depth readout.  Rick
279879,Blake,2008-12-15 15:35:00,418,We have most models at the Store (FW) drop by and take a look at them.  We have all 3 manufacturers on display.
279881,Handlebarz,2008-12-15 15:45:00,3790,Who has tried the Showdown I am still thinking about it I just dont see my self spending $500 for a flasher I'm not saying they are not worth it but I can buy some extra musky stuff for the $$$ I save. From many I have talked with they seem to like the Showdown but to each there own I am still in the dark ages with my sonar shes a gray scale but works great.
279882,RickOnt,2008-12-15 15:45:00,669,Blake  Is that Fishing World in Hamilton???
279895,Uncle Buck,2008-12-15 16:17:00,1000,Yup... In Hamilton  http://www.fishingworld.ca/

278198,SlowPoke,2008-12-11 11:33:00,2984,I know someone dying to try his out! He might even convince me to venture out onto the ice this year to see the new toy in action. -Brian
278199,BUSTER,2008-12-11 11:39:00,1336,500 bucks!
278200,danbo,2008-12-11 11:40:00,2646,Who..pray tell? Bri?  Hey Buster.. I spent $250 on a knife last year!  or tattoos as well!!  This sonar should come with a Wolverine Fur Collar at least!
278202,SlowPoke,2008-12-11 11:47:00,2984," If he wants to chime in, he will. I just know he's pretty stoked about it!"
278208,Seaweed,2008-12-11 12:13:00,135,Hummingbird has done their homework and the product looks good... but it is unproven and still lacks some features that other sonars have.   The Marcum LX-5 is still the top sonar... don't kid yourself.
278211,danbo,2008-12-11 12:22:00,2646,"Fill us in, bro.."
278212,Greencoachdog,2008-12-11 12:26:00,8163,If it's a 'Bird... it's gotta be good!!!
278213,danbo,2008-12-11 12:29:00,2646,"Sick 'em, dawg!"
278220,PERCHER,2008-12-11 13:14:00,787,Yes I bought the Ice 55 and Brian will be on the ice to try it out.Right  Bud?Can't wait it looks amazing! I really think it will be the king of the flashers.But only time will tell. Dan
278224,danbo,2008-12-11 13:27:00,2646,
278225,PERCHER,2008-12-11 13:33:00,787,
278228,Billy Bob,2008-12-11 13:47:00,5865,WAY over priced. For that amount of money it should a LEAST have a built in GPS.  Cabela's right now has the Lowrance 522c unit that includes GPS with internal antenna for only $499  http://www.cabelas.com/cabelas/en/template...requestid=20849
278230,anders,2008-12-11 13:55:00,1168,"what the price comparison between that the vex, and the marcum?  I know i could go and look it up, but its early and im tired lol."
278232,PERCHER,2008-12-11 13:56:00,787,You can't compare fixed mount sonars to portable flashers they are two totally different units..Compare the Bird in price to the top of the line Vex or Marcrum and you will see they are not over priced. -Dan-.
278236,Billy Bob,2008-12-11 14:02:00,5865,They are both OVERPRICED ! ! !  It may because it's a more limited market in the ice fishing world.  I made a box to hold my unit and use a motorcycle battery to power it. It works great on the ice and for fly-ins or where ever  a portable unit is needed.
278237,trapshooter,2008-12-11 14:02:00,1234,"I bought one too.  They are definitely not over priced compared to Marcum or Vex.  They are all in the same ballpark, marcum is the most expensive.  If you buy a top of the line Vex, they even ding you extra for a case.  I'm looking forward to putting it through its paces this winter.  I like the fact it has a LCD display that shows depth and other function information from the graph."
278443,xeon,2008-12-11 23:52:00,350,"Figured Id try one out too see if there line is any good, going to try it out on some whitefish this weekend so Ill be sure to have a follow up.  Dont jump the gun on crowning it the king yet... might just have a whole buncha features that dont work worth a dam."
278452,danbo,2008-12-12 00:12:00,2646,"So ,  yer gonna blow $600 clams on  junk?"
278457,Grimace,2008-12-12 00:18:00,2020,I am eager to see one in action this year.   I will reserve my judgement until that time
278460,danbo,2008-12-12 00:23:00,2646,I posted this on another board & got gang-banged by the locals! Everybody is a supreme expert on ice-sonar now..
278463,Grimace,2008-12-12 00:27:00,2020,"lol.   I am no expert thats for sure.   I have not met an ice sonar I haven't liked yet..   I guess I am easy to please.  All i know is that i love my vex fl-18, I have witnessed a lx-5 and it was even better and now I want to check out one of these babies."
278513,xeon,2008-12-12 01:48:00,350,"  lol ya i saw that on the ice shanty board, i think everyone thought you poop on their sonars."
278607,Rich,2008-12-12 13:33:00,3927,I could buy a Vex for that.. why buy anything else
279591,RickOnt,2008-12-14 21:01:00,669,"Hi ALL  I have been looking at the Marcum and the Vex for about 2 years!!! But can't decide!! I know Worst than a W-man!!!  Any way this new Hummingbird has really got me interested BUT should I buy the 45 or 55??  The 55 has up to a 6 color set for markings with several 3 color sets!!  It also has a purple line to set for depth,  Are these options good or???   Are they worth the Extra$$$   Rick"
