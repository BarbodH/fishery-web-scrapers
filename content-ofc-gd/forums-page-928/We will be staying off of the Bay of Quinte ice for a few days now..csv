There were only a couple of places that were accessible on foot, and in my opinion, all of these will now be unsafe. Soft ice is bad news...  I have a family vacation planned for a few days this week, and it looks like I timed it just right! I'll be back by Friday and hopefully it will be tight enough again by then.  Jeff"
