Not Really, because if you take away Ontario's Problems the Rest of Canadas is doing well despite the Worlds Economy,  Saskatchewan and  Manitoba actually bought more North American Vehicles than Last year.  Housing prices are dropping and more are up for Sale.  Oil and Potash are now settling just waiting when prices go up. There are more jobs that people to fill.  Now Ill make the same comment I said last year when I was called a Racist.  I would Rather see Canadians taking these jobs than going overseas of which the Saskatchewan and Alberta governments are forced to do. ( explain to me why this is Racist)  Its Simple, MOVE.  The rumours oil has slowed in AB?  Maybe in the exploration department for now, but definitely not in the Servicing.  As far as a Bailout is concerned, as an outsider looking inside, totally against it as its a waste of money and a losing cause and I couldnt care less about over paid Unions and Spoiled workers.  Unfortunately the three stooges convinced alot of you Guys ( Not everyone in Central Canada) that there must be a Bailout) before the Americans even decided. LMAOL.

279654,holdfast,2008-12-14 23:12:00,1813,"Oh one last point.  Before I even moved I had a job lined up via phone calls, attitude, emailing Resumes, and knowing the first job will probably not be my last but a start."
279655,irishfield,2008-12-14 23:14:00,26272,Are you trying to convince us... or yourself... that you made the right move to go to SK HF?
279658,outllaw,2008-12-14 23:25:00,1232,well dah. maybe the un-educated unemplyed folks can head out and pick wheat. heard theres lots of openings .lol.
279681,kerr,2008-12-15 00:09:00,77,overpaid spoiled workers might be the wrong thing to say about people who go in to same same place day in and day out for years to feed their families. dont knock someone before youve been in their shoes. i thought this was a fishing site. not cnn. happy holidays people
279686,holdfast,2008-12-15 00:14:00,1813," Maybe what Im saying is maybe a move is in order to feed your family as thousands have done in the past.  Whos to say that tomorrow we may have the same problems as Ontario.  The going is good now, sometimes you have to find your luck."
279689,holdfast,2008-12-15 00:18:00,1813,"Actually if your uneducated, thick as a Brick, you can pick wheat/cotton and in the mean time educate yourself and get a trade.  Most jobs that are hiring will pay as part of a Coop as long as you are willing to show up everyday and put in an effort."
279694,irishfield,2008-12-15 00:25:00,26272,I think Outlaw is happy just sitting at home playing with his wood HF !
279696,holdfast,2008-12-15 00:26:00,1813," Also a discussion Board, Bif.  As an under paid worker that put in lots of hours and time, and sacrifice.  30 dollars, not counting Benefits ect, ect equaling 70 dollars plus.  remember our salaries are counted before benefits are taken off, I shake my head at the two whiny workers seen on CBC, using a pulley to lift his air impact and tighten four bolts.  I suppose I was supposed to feel sorry for him.  I'm sure he does when I have to bring my crap vehicle in for repair because its built like crap.  I don't think so Biffer!  My point is their are jobs out here.  Move."
