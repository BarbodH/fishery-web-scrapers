280204,solopaddler,2008-12-16 13:16:00,8605,"Great stuff Ben, can't wait to get out myself!"
279290,trapshooter,2008-12-14 04:28:00,1234,"Got out today since it wasn't -30 for a change.  Still have to get runners on my trap so I'm not using it yet.  Got to test out the new toy, Humminbird ICE45 flasher.  Very impressed with it, to say the least.   FYI - it is marking bottom but I think my reflection on the display prevented the camera from picking it up in the picture.  We were on a lake that holds walleye, pike and perch.  Almost right away my buddy Bryon had a good scrap with a pike.  Turned out to be a nice 33"" that we released without a picture.  The walleye and perch moved in later in the afternoon and we managed a few of them.  Here's my buddy Colin with a nice eye.   My first walleye on the ice this season.   We caught them on set lines and jigging spoons tipped with minnows.  We were fishing a sand/weed flat in about 12-13FOW."
279291,Guest gbfisher,2008-12-14 04:33:00,0,the salt really hurts there Ben....
279292,Grimace,2008-12-14 04:36:00,2020,Nice job.   Whenever I take a picture of my flasher not all of the marks come up either.    The lights turn on and off really fast so the camera will catch them in the off sometimes.
279293,Guest gbfisher,2008-12-14 04:40:00,0,....thats it grimace.
279294,Grimace,2008-12-14 04:43:00,2020, Huh?
279296,Guest gbfisher,2008-12-14 04:49:00,0,
279300,Grimace,2008-12-14 04:54:00,2020,Ah.   I get it.      I haven't laid eyes on my spinning flasher since last January.   Soon.  Nice fish again man.   I wish I was prospecting for gold in NW Ontario.

279423,limeyangler,2008-12-14 15:16:00,5204,"Great stuff Ben, really, and i mean REALLY nice walters you guys got. That hummingbird looks a decent bit of kit too.  I'm just taking a break from putting the runners on my sled too as we speak.  Great stuff."
279456,lunkerbasshunter,2008-12-14 16:26:00,2585,sweet report!  Sure looks like a couple nice eyes you guys got there!  Cheers!
279593,young_one,2008-12-14 21:05:00,620,Thanks for the early ice reports! Im starting to get the itch real bad. Im glad you are happy with the Humminbird unit!
279892,RickOnt,2008-12-15 16:13:00,669,Ben  I get the Red x thing where there should be pics of pick!!!!   As to the runners for the trap I put them on my Yukon but after 2 years they were almost gone So i put a pair of old downhill skis on top of the Runners # years now and still good to go.  If I was doing it again I would Not use the Runners BUT Go directly with the Downhill Skis!!!  Rick
279893,trapshooter,2008-12-15 16:16:00,1234,That's odd.  I'm seeing the pics.  Anyone else not seeing them?
279900,Leecher,2008-12-15 16:25:00,7832," Ben, I was able to yesterday, but now only see red X's.  Maybe the site where you uploaded the pics is down or something Leechman"
