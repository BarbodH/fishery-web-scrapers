278866,buckster,2008-12-12 23:25:00,530,So i just got the call from my old man 20 mins ago. He took a shot at a buck and missed. (Freaking of course) Took a look at his crossbow and the tip of his limb fell off he has an exomag with magtip limbs. That woulda been buck #3 for him this year. So here is my question does he need a new set of limbs or can the mag tips be replaced and if so where can i get this done............ help me out here gang. Im gonna be busy calling around places and doing some googling....

279761,steelhead hunter,2008-12-15 02:47:00,152,it has to be sent back to excaliber to be fixed the only way he could have blown the tips off was either he didn't have the arrow all the way back or dry fired it  tell him to remove the pads from the dissapator bars check out the the excaliber web site at www.excalibercrossbow.com or better yet give them a call 519 743 6890
279963,buckster,2008-12-15 19:50:00,530,Late friday night i emailed excalibur and told them my problem and asked what my options are.  Early this afternoon i got a reply from Steve Sheffel Sales and Marketing Excalibur Crossbow Inc. He told me to call him asap so we can fix my problem.  So that is what i did.  He told me he will ship me new limbs free of charge and all i have to do is ship him the broken set when my new ones arrive.   What a great place and great pepole over at excalibur. That is what i call customer service.  Its nice to see a company that stands by thier product.  This is how you keep a customer for life.  They even called me back about 20 mins ago to verify my dads camo pattern. Limbs are on the way!   I will always recommend excalibur for an excellent product and great customer service.
