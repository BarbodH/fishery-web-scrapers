279308,Leecher,2008-12-14 05:13:00,7832, Thanks Simon     Simply feels awesome to walk on to the ice and be able to fish..... next time will be spending more time at it and the thumb thingy.... just don't know what he was thinking  The UFO on the pic was remote control planes that a couple of guys were playing with when we arrived  Thanks again Simon... will keep on posting as the season progress Jacques
279315,Ramble,2008-12-14 05:25:00,713,"REAL MEN LIP PIKE! Don't let anyone tell you other wise. LoL I've done it before, and I'll do it again. Sometimes they will even let you get away with it.  Good to see people getting out on teh hard water.  -Dave"
279317,medmart,2008-12-14 05:31:00,587,Great report Jaques good to see the hard water reports maybe you can make it up to the BOQ this year for some eyes  Rob
279385,Leecher,2008-12-14 14:04:00,7832, Thanks Dave      everything was fine up until the pike did a head shake   Thanks Rob      BOQ would be nice..... will just have to see
280013,snag,2008-12-15 23:05:00,1932,Good job man!  A little blood spilled is good luck in the future.
280028,waterwolf,2008-12-15 23:50:00,556,"jacques ,, i'm trying to stay focused on fillin' my bow tag!! don't distract me with ice fishing fantasies.  i'm green with envie in my winter camo. damn season over-lap.  thanks for the tease,, great to see you got out on the hard stuff ,,,and iced a few ."
280076,Leecher,2008-12-16 01:17:00,7832, Thanks SNAG     Didn't know that but I like it
280081,Leecher,2008-12-16 01:27:00,7832, Well then.... hurry up and get that tag filled Thanks waterwolf  How's the season going so far?  any deer activity around your hunting area? Have you seen any good ones? Jacques
280130,waterwolf,2008-12-16 03:35:00,556,"it's gettin' harder to get out with xmas gettin' closer ,,and the weather's hard to work\ predict. seen some huge bucks ,,just can't hunt at the airport . lol . i've given up on antlers and will definitely settle for a nice doe, again. one in the freezer already but have an additional tag for either to fill.  hard to pattern deer right now , crops comin'off the fields ,wintering habits starting ,, oh , i have a whole bag of excuses.lol.      this saturday is booked for huntin' ,, hell or high water .. give me a gentle but steady wind outta the north and i've got a chance.  then the ice gear comes out ."
280136,irishfield,2008-12-16 03:52:00,26272,You can hunt at the airport... but only with the airport managers written permission. They might actually appreciate it if if you approach them.... as 400 lbs does a lot of damage when it leaps in front on take off.
280139,BassAsin,2008-12-16 04:01:00,806,"i woulda had ta been on th ice i suppose, -29 is my limit -30 not gonna do it but 29 its all a go if the truck and ski-doo start!"
280194,Whitespinnerbait,2008-12-16 11:44:00,2038,"Jacques..  Kevin and I went back Sunday afternoon for a couple of hours , the perch were still very active.      Oh ya,, on the way over to the bay we meet up with a pair of strange looking Dudes    "
280215,Leecher,2008-12-16 14:21:00,7832," Sometimes you just can't pick and choose and go with your gut feeling..... this late in the season, deer are migrating to their winter grounds and  makes for a more challenging hunt  Good luck to ya this Saturday, will be keeping an eye out for your report"
280274,Leecher,2008-12-16 16:42:00,7832, At -30C I don't go out unless I have some sort of shelter.... usually will go to an outfitter for that cause I don't own one.  We always go out in the open and the only luxury we have is an ice bucket to sit on
280276,Leecher,2008-12-16 16:51:00,7832," Paul, those are jumbo perch    too bad they have parasites on them.  Look at yours, the tail holds a couple of yellowish ones That pair would be good table fare for thanksgiving     Great shot  Will talk later about this upcoming weekend.... The ice should be thicker now that the snow melted and the temps dipped below zero to freeze it over again"
279174,Leecher,2008-12-13 23:33:00,7832,"Well guys just got back from McLauren bay and let me tell ya it feels good to be able to go out fishing finally  Last night Paul and I talked about going but since the temps dipped @ -28C overnight, no way we were going to head out early morning.  The plan was to go in the afternoon for a couple of hours and check out our favorite spot.  We left home at around 1:00pm, had to stop to get a couple of dozen of minnows and the way we went..... got to our spot at around 1:30pm and let me tell ya the road leading to the bay had a lot of snow and this is what greeted us    Got our gear prepared and the way we go    We started to walk on ice or should I say in deep snow on top of the ice and immediately drilled a hole with the auger to verify the ice thinkness.... to our surprise it was 6"" inches thick with 4"" of black ice and 2"" of white.  As we continued walking toward our spot we found some deer tracks going across the bay and little further drilled another hole and it was the same thickness.... Ice was safe to walk on  Once arrived at destination we setup our tipups..... took a quick pick of one of mine    Not 10 munites went by and Paul gets a hit but did not manage to land the fish...... had the camera ready and all but just not meant to be  Right after that I get a hit... one of my tipups goes down, set the hook, start pulling on the line and got a huge perch to the hole only to see it do a U turn and go back down  Minutes later got another hit and this is what I caught    First fish of season for me and I'm all excited  Then it's Paul's turn to get a hit..... set's the hook and starts pulling the line in..... this is what he got    His first also and had to snap another shot    I was real happy for Paul that he got his first and if we caught more, would be bonus..... well that did not stop there,  Paul managed to catch a snot rocket not long after and here it is    He tried to lip him and was fine until the pike did a head shake    here is the results    I guess he's so use to catch bass that he did not think about the teeth We stayed a little longer until darkness set in and snow started to fall, then we called it a day.  Real happy of the outcome and was a fun time out there even if we did not catch a lot  Hope you enjoy Jacques aka Leechman"
279179,Mike the Pike,2008-12-13 23:44:00,3421,Wow nice to see a more local hard water report Was Paul's head or hands too cold and numb to remember how to hold a pike Ouch that looks nasty.  I hope I meet up with you guys sooner hope it stays cold.
279180,Greencoachdog,2008-12-13 23:48:00,8163,Great report and pics Jacques!!!  It looks pretty doggone cold out there too!  I bet Paul won't be lipping anymore Pike real soon eh  ... tell him Wall-ices got teeth too!
279183,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-12-13 23:51:00,1362,"""left home at 1:00PM""???????????????......Jacques, ya gotta get outa the bed earlier then that if ya wanna catch the big one  ....  Thanks for the mini report"
279184,fishindevil,2008-12-13 23:51:00,6254,"Well done guys !!! glad to see another hardwater report/pics,it sure does look like you guys have lots of snow up there too!!   i thought you wernt supposed to ""lip"" a pike !!!!

279197,Leecher,2008-12-14 00:28:00,7832, Thanks Mike.... guess he didn't think but like I said was fine up to when the pike did a head shake I sure can't wait to meet you and the sooner the better..... season just begun    Let us know when you are coming down    Thanks Glen.... I'm sure he won't be doing that again but will let him explain   I know Steve but -28C is a little too cold for my likings and you are right about a mini report    Nothing compare to last year but was just to see if the ice was thick enough
279198,lunkerbasshunter,2008-12-14 00:30:00,2585,great hard water report!  cheers!
279201,Leecher,2008-12-14 00:34:00,7832," Thanks fishindevil, we sure did get a lot of snow for the first down pour..... I'll let Paul answer that one   Thanks Jim..... I don't know what he was thinking at the time it happened   Thanks Micro.... not really"

279209,Leecher,2008-12-14 00:49:00,7832, Thanks BUSTER    I know now what you mean
279212,Leecher,2008-12-14 00:52:00,7832, Steve you'll have to come out with us next time we go back there.... you have to get to use them wooden things I made you     Lets keep in touch..... Are you going to put your shack out on the ice this year??
279217,Silo Buster,2008-12-14 01:04:00,81,Great report
279218,Greencoachdog,2008-12-14 01:04:00,8163," You'll have to excuse Mr. Hole, Jacques... it seems his ergonomically shaped snow shovel got away from him and he ran head first into a snowbank while chasing it  , kinda explains the hair-do  ... and his glasses got so cold they turned blue!!!  Brain frostbite doncha yanno."
