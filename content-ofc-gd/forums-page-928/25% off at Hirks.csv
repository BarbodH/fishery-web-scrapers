No screwing around on the 25% I think it was everything except Rapala, Gulp and maybe Powerbait.  Mustang suits were 25% off too!  There were a few marine items too.  Prices on the Rapala stuff were good already about on line with Walmart I think and other prices were good too (so -25% is actually a real discount).  The store is not completely packed with stuff but what was there was well selected.  There were a lot of plastics, some ice fishing wear and the usual fishing stuff.  Most of this stuff I bought will sit in the tackle box until spring  Hirk was good and had a few suggestions on purchases.  It was well worth dropping in, I will go again.  forrest"
