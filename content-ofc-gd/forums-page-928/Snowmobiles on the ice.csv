279433,Bernie,2008-12-14 15:44:00,3190," John, you are from the days when we had fun on sleds! They did have their moments. Blown head gaskets, fouled spark plugs, oil on your suit about your belly button height, blown and badly worn belts, and what drove me crazy was the rattle from the brake and throttle levers on ski-doos. Dads old snowcruisers didn't do that. I welded on old 3 corner files on my runners, they worked pretty good too. The sleds today are fun to ride though. They are much more controllable, but they are too fast and I worry about my son riding the hot rods. But I suppose my father worried about me too."
279445,JohnF,2008-12-14 16:16:00,3494," My TNT's were bad for blowback. My yellow canary suit had a permanent oily belly. The cognoscenti knew which belts could be borrowed from other machines to subtley alter the clutching on Skidoos, and vice versa. If I remember correctly my Kohler powered Rupps ran better with the standard Skidoo belt, but it had to come from Gates or Dayco, I forget which now. It was fractionally wider or narrower (I forget which) and once you got the springs, ramps and dogs just right you got just a tad more response. I remember a night spent on Rice Lake with one of my dealers (who was into sled racing too) grinding weights and changing springs on some new Comet clutches until we got it just right. Then sending off the specs to the manufacturer to get a bulletin sent to the OSRF scrutineers in the morning so we could use the new clutch legally. .  We thought we were pretty sophisticated when we started carrying a range of carb jets for the Mikunis. I don't think we really had a clue what we were doing but sometimes we just got lucky.  I remember loaning one of my stock Rupps to a Polaris team driver for a marathon event cuz his had blown something. I warned him about the launch but he just did what he always did with his polarises and threw his weight back hard when the flag dropped. He got a little more traction than he expected and the sled went right up and over on it's back. One of the risks of having the clutch engage at about 5 grand I guess.  Yeah. Those were the days.  JF"
279471,Bernie,2008-12-14 16:44:00,3190,"In years past our community had annual winter carnivals that were hugely popular. In 1973 they set up an oval track for sled racing. Two or three days of mild destroyed the track the week before the occasion. On the Friday of the weekend event winter returned with a vengeance. It was decided on Friday evening to hold some kind of racing event. My dad and I went to work on a Johnson Rampage 440. We cleaned up the clutching, drained the fuel tank to a minimum, loosened up the track a little, fresh air filter(yes these sleds had a filter) and a few other ""improvements"" So on Saturday morning they cleared the main street of town of vehicles. The start line was at the local downtown garage and the finish line was at the Windsor Hotel. I was only 14 at the time and was a little tentative about actual racing. When I seen a Speedway racing team roll into the pits my heart sunk. These guys looked really professional! The street was lined with people, there had to be over a thousand it seemed to me at the time. I lined up at the start line for the men's 440 heat. I was racing a local and won the heat. Eventually won 3rd in that division. In the junior class I was 1st. All in all a lot of fun. No way you could do that in today's society. Laws and faster machines have taken away some of the things we used to do."
279482,JohnF,2008-12-14 16:53:00,3494," This is fun. I'd forgotten the Speedways. Fast. The Kalamazoo sleds were cool too, and the THUNDERJETS. They were an accident waiting to happen but fun to watch. Remember when Motoski brought the alcohol carbed free air sleds? And Villeneuve's twin trax? Did he ever get beaten when he finished the race, not that he finished many with those things?  JF"
279483,Sinker,2008-12-14 16:54:00,8692,I just got in from a 2 hour ride on a twin track Alpine. I'm beat!!! They sure pack a nice ski trail though  Sinker
279484,JohnF,2008-12-14 16:55:00,3494, Do they still make those. There was a Valmont too. Don't remember what the difference was.  JF
279492,Sinker,2008-12-14 17:05:00,8692," Not that I know of. These ones are early/mid 80s models. They run great, but ya can't turn much   Similar to riding a brick  Sinker"
279494,JohnF,2008-12-14 17:08:00,3494," I'm talking early early 70's, still living in the past. Guess I just can't give up the days of hair and girlfriends and motorized toys you could actually fix yerself without a computer.  JF"
279500,Bernie,2008-12-14 17:32:00,3190,Alpine and Elan parts are getting rare. Many pieces are now obsolete. There are a few Alpines around but most around here are so so badly used and old they are getting very difficult to patch up anymore. On the other hand the Scandic superwidetrack will out do the Alpine in every way.
279803,Sinker,2008-12-15 05:08:00,8692,"We have an old wide track skandic as well. I'm not sure if its a superwide or not, but its a beast also. The Alpine still packs a better trail......no question.......they're just a pig to run!  I broke the throttle cable on the alpine today......any idea where to get a new one?  Sinker"
279804,irishfield,2008-12-15 05:09:00,26272, Bike department at CTC ?
279805,Sinker,2008-12-15 05:13:00,8692,I already have it jimmy rigged well enough to run.....  It would be nice to have the real part.
279806,irishfield,2008-12-15 05:15:00,26272,For sure sinker... did the casing break or just the inner cable. Easy to fabricate a new one if just the inner.
279807,Sinker,2008-12-15 05:25:00,8692,"Well, the inner snapped, but the casing caused it to wear out. The metal casing is frayed under the plastic sheath, and its tearing up the cable. Its right on the turn into the lever. I have it jimmy rigged for now, but I need a new piece of cable for sure. The whole thing would be a thing of beauty!    Sinker"
279840,JohnF,2008-12-15 14:01:00,3494," Check around at some of the real old Skidoo dealers. It's amazing what they have hiding away on the parts shelves. Somebody who sold 'em years ago may know what part will work off another model too. Bombardier was terrible for assigning new part numbers to the same part for different models and you just had to know what worked.  I was a local hero one year when the 440 TNT's were burning up hot side pistons really fast. I had gotten a tip from the boys in the racing dept when I was in Barrie for service school that they were gonna be a problem and that the best replacement was the 399 TNT piston. Worked like a charm and I had dozens in inventory when the replacement notice went out just after the first good snow. Our customers really saw the benefit of buying locally that year. Seems the piston part number for the 440 was backorderedand the other dealers didn't know about the interchangeable piston thing. The guys who'd saved $50 by going out of town to buy got pretty riled when we told 'em we'd be doing our own customers' sleds first. Several even went whining to Bombardier who finally told us we had an obligation to honour all warranty work. We told them it was no problem but our customers would all be done first.  Barring finding the proper part, as Wayne has said, it's not hard to fabricate a new one. Those old Tillotsons had enough extra meat in them, at least the HD's, that you can drill and tap for a stopper clamp somewhere if you can't reuse the bracket that's on it now.  JF"
279426,JohnF,2008-12-14 15:18:00,3494," JD built one nifty little 292 model (I'm pretty sure it wasn't a 340) that was pretty popular in the stock classes for a couple of years. The rest pretty much lived up to their tractor heritage,  JF"
277748,Greencoachdog,2008-12-10 01:13:00,8163,Dr. Giesbrect is at it again!  Floatation suit vs. Snowmobile suit  
277789,Whitespinnerbait,2008-12-10 02:30:00,2038,One or the other wouldn't make a difference ....your going to the bottom anyways
277800,F7Firecat,2008-12-10 03:33:00,347,Depends if your fishing go with the floater if your sledding go with a good snowmobile suit.  I have a Riema Goretex suit and I wouldnt trade it for anything. -30 across the lake at 100 mph and I am toasty warm. Floaters get hard with limited movement in the winter also.  just my opinion  Bryan
277827,Greencoachdog,2008-12-10 08:21:00,8163," Watch the video!    Yeah, that pretty little sled suit of yours will make a nice anchor to drag you to the bottom when it fills with water and before your body even reaches hypothermic conditions should you ever happen to go thru the ice too!  If you're taking your machine on the ice you need to wear a flotation suit!!!   Not that I really care one way or the other... I just like to remind y'all of the horrible death y'all face when you do stupid stuff on the ice."
277858,Fisherman,2008-12-10 13:44:00,7201,"That's okay GCD, natures way of thinning out the herd at 100mph. Love when they become missles, hilarious to watch.."
277903,babaganoush,2008-12-10 16:15:00,105,and why do you find it hilarious when they go 100 mph????? im sure fisherman if you had a sled you would be  puttin along at 1mph???
277913,Fisherman,2008-12-10 16:43:00,7201,"It's the ones that are oblivious or simply don't care about the dangers of not seeing huge pressure cracks or other bumps and lumps and get launched into the air, drive with expectations that you want to come home, not end up like humpty dumpty..and no I don't putt along, I keep it at the speed that I can see stuff comin at me.  We hear of those Darwin awards every winter, want to be a statistic, fell free."
277928,kemper,2008-12-10 17:39:00,2232,"BWAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH          WHACK                  BOINGGGGGGGGGGGGGG                   splat.    Soundtrack to a snowmobiler smacking a pressure crack at 100 mph. Its not a pretty sight. Sleds are awesome machines, and its hard not to let them rip at top throttle, but do it when you are somewhere you know is completely safe if you must. A lake probably isnt the best place, because a pressure crack can appear in a spot where is wasnt a couple days earlier."
277944,douG,2008-12-10 18:18:00,2693, How do you possibly figger your going to the bottom while wearing a floatation suit?  I always thought that was the whole idea there.
277948,Reelpro,2008-12-10 18:39:00,73,"The Mustang Ice Rider 2 peice suit is just as comfy and warm as any regular sleddin suit. a little pricey, but nice insurance.  I've worn out 2 suits now, only went in the water once.  that was actually down at Quinte in November. From a boat - no ice.  They make great spring/fall fishing suits as well as winter. Better than lots of clothes and a bulky life jacket. Just got to try an keep the Walleye Poo off them, so ya look good sleddin.  The Mustang do not stiffen up in cold like some others, or their older versions."
277957,BITEME,2008-12-10 19:08:00,1969,Always carry an easy to get at Knife on your suit to cut away !!!!! who am i kidding always carry a knife. snow suits become one with the water floaters rise above
278089,Greencoachdog,2008-12-11 01:18:00,8163, How clever of those floatation suit manufacturers eh!!!  The snowmobile goes down   but you stay up!... aint dat da cats azz!!!
278166,F7Firecat,2008-12-11 04:49:00,347,"GCD,  Pretty hard to go under doing 120 mph across the lake. Thats why I dont need a floater suit.  I gave up ice fishing long ago, not my style..............boring actually.  So you take your floater suit and go freeze your ass off looking for a some little perch, I'll be sure to suit up in my goretex and fly by you at 120mph and creat some wind chill for you in your cardboard floater suit. LOL  And before the good ole boys from OFC gang up and cut me up Im outta here at 120 mph   Bring it on boyz!!  BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP"
278210,Whitespinnerbait,2008-12-11 12:15:00,2038,"  Never heard of a case were a snowmobiler was rescued..... Hours , Days , later from wearing a floatation suit after crashing through the ice. Usually they crash through the ice when there the only ones out on early ice ,No one else around anyways ...Ya know what i'm saying Ehhhhhh."
278243,bigugli,2008-12-11 14:10:00,6138,And here I thought part of the fun of ice fishing season was dragging the bottom for corpses.
278477,Reelpro,2008-12-12 00:51:00,73," Yup me an my floater suit will watch you roar by on the Cat. Then when it craps out like most of em do, I'll wave as I sail by at 125MPH on my SkiDOO. With my nice 2 dinner walleye's on board.  EEEEEEE"
278541,F7Firecat,2008-12-12 03:27:00,347,LOL  ya think so ehhhhhhhhh  
278548,Mike the Pike,2008-12-12 04:05:00,3421,"Well GCD I often wondered why so many die every year but no floater suit.  The video clearly shows proof that one has a much better chance to survive.  If I had a sled the suit would be on.  Who says a floater suit is not warm.  I bought mine one size too big with a couple of layers underneath I am often too hot.  A good quality suit is warm, a base model bouy O bouy suit may not be warm.  you get what you pay for.  Why is it one can spend as much as $12 000 dollars on a speedy snowmobile and not spend an extra $500 on something that can saves ones life.Its the same as being in a boat without a PFD on your back.  Pay now or die later.I would rather have the fighting chance with something that floats.  My mom's husband is a Firefighter in Northbay and they have the lovely job of finding the dead bodies at the bottom of the lake he also told me about the snowmobilers that fall off at highspeed.Alot of mangled bodies.  Why are some so stubborn  Life is too short to be a hard head.  Good on you Glenn to post this"
