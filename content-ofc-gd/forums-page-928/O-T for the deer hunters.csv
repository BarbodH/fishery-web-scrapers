The first is called ""30 point buck"" and the other ""Second Week of Deer Camp""..... Did a little search on the web and to my surprise found a version with video of both.  Have a look at them, lyrics, real funny  30 Point Buck:   Second week of Deer Camp   Leechman"

Also two does checked in with antlers, and one moron checking a deer in with the wrong tag, when the check in attendant mentioned it to him he grabbed his paper work bag and drove off, must have done something questionable?  Check in around here is the bait store at the corner of my street, seen some big deer there in the past."
