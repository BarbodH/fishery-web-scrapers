I'm pretty new to trib fishing, especially this time of the year. With the high temps and rain today and yesterday. The tribs should have a good flow of current to break the ice? I plan to fish Wed cause on Tues the rivers are probably too blown-up? What are some of the good colour flies I should bring?"
