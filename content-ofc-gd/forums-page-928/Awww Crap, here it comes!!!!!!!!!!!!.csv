279700,Bernie,2008-12-15 00:38:00,3190, I suppose we are all aware it's winter Glen. But it's hitting some of us very unusually hard. An accumulation of snow like we have now would be somewhat normal by February but its only halfway into December. The ground isn't frozen and so in many lakes there is little or no ice either. Makes for a possible dangerous situation. I would love to have some normal winter. We have to be careful with snowmobiling too. The trails also have no frozen bottom in some spots. I had to rescue my son who got stuck in a creek last week trying to pack down the trail.
279705,Greencoachdog,2008-12-15 00:42:00,8163," Having snow is what y'all are famous for, it's your heritage!!!  You should be worshipping the little white flakes of notoriety... not batching aboot them!!!  Give thanks!"
279716,holdfast,2008-12-15 01:05:00,1813,"Yup minus 40s here.  I went to Big River on Friday knowing it was going down Big time.  Left the Ranger at home and used the Corolla instead as I did not want to be stuck out there and I just don't trust the Ford.  Plugged her in for two days and took off this morning and five minutes out of town a Warning light went on and had to phone home as the manual was on the Kitchen table.  Found out it was low tire pressure two hours later. filled her up. I was kind of worried breaking down, as I could of had warmer clothes with me.  I got spare cloths in the truck but not the car as its the first time I took it to the Trailer.  The only problems were a stiff clutch pedal and of course the low tires."
279720,Greencoachdog,2008-12-15 01:13:00,8163,"  I knew it!!!... listening to too much Alice Cooper has fried your brain!  Boy Scouts motto: Always be prepared!  U.S Marine Corps. Adapt, improvise, and overcome!  If there's anything else you need to know just give me a holler."
280016,tjsa,2008-12-15 23:20:00,1578," Yup, its cold, going down to -30C overnight tonight. No beer truck got stuck in front of my house though, they just back in and offload my monthly prescription  I took tomorrow off to clear my driveway. Had to go into work early today and have not cleared it yet. Thankfully I have a 4x4, cause I did not get 30 ft. in 2 wheel drive backing up, and that was just in my driveway. I had to set up equipment for a press conference today. They did not cancel it, even though Donna Cansfield and another Minister were supposed to be here, but their flights got canceled. Local MPP's and our Mayor spoke for them. I also had to shovel out our work truck in the early morning because they plowed overnight behind it, sheesh!!!!!!! And the loading dock was also still snowed in, but I managed to get the truck backed up to it. It was still not cleared when I left at 4 pm.  Ahhh well, life in the Great White North. You have gotten your share of snow this year also right?????????"

279510,tjsa,2008-12-14 17:48:00,1578," Cliff................now how are you going to have that back yard skating rink in that temperature? When we are finished with this in the next 3 days, we will send it on down to you, free of charge,"
279519,Bernie,2008-12-14 18:02:00,3190,Snow! Yuuukkk. It actually has settled a little today. We need about three days of mild to get rid of some snow. Not the cold Tom wants to send us.    Anybody want to come and shovel my roof?

279589,JohnF,2008-12-14 20:57:00,3494,"  Think of it as extra insulation. I spent half the day yesterday raking insulation off my mom's roof. Man, is that hard on the back.  JF"
279594,ccmtcanada,2008-12-14 21:05:00,7971, LOL...worked on it today...framing it....need the warm temps for that.  Send the snow mid week...then the cold a few days later!!! Need the snow to level the frame and liner and cold without snow to freeze it up!  
279620,tjsa,2008-12-14 22:08:00,1578," Good on ya Cliff, the snow and cold will come soon enough. I just went outside. About 2 inches so far, but with the wind and more snow falling until around midnight, I expect big drifts around my vehicles and doorstep in the morning. Limeyangler, and the rest of the OFC guys west of me are getting the cold temps though, we are rather balmy at -17 overnight.  http://www.weatheroffice.gc.ca/city/pages/...e.html#detailsf"
279640,Leecher,2008-12-14 22:41:00,7832,"Here in Gatineau, had another 10cm's of snow overnight..... Just got back from blowing that snow and now it's freezing rain coming down It's -4C right now but their calling for a low of +3C overnight and +9C tomorrow"
279648,irishfield,2008-12-14 23:01:00,26272,I hope it warms up QUICK Leechman.. as my wife just left Ottawa in Freezing rain and -3C..  and is headed home. It's 4C and raining here in Penetang. Hope the 2.5 feet of compacted snow slides off my shop's steel roof SOON.. before it's totally saturated and collapses it.
279653,Leecher,2008-12-14 23:12:00,7832," Wayne, how long of a drive is it from Ottawa to Penetang??  2.5' feet     You guys sure got more snow then we do..... I hope too that it warms up for ya"
279656,irishfield,2008-12-14 23:19:00,26272," Probably gonna take her 6 hours.  Not sure how much snowfall we've got in accumulated total...but based on how many times I've plowed 6"" or more..probably 8 to 10 feet by now. It's come off the roof once before already. Pool deck has over 3 feet of compacted snow on it. Yard, because the ground isn't frozen and snows melting from beneath, is still a good 2 feet deep. Our property is the highest point of land on the Penninsula of land between Penetang and Midland harbours. We are in direct line of a North wind coming across the open waters of Georgian Bay and  the lake is 580 above sea level... we are 760 and it seems the cloud/squall hooks and stays here!"
279661,Leecher,2008-12-14 23:29:00,7832, 6 hours     I say that is a long time to be driving in those arsh conditions... I bet you can't wait to see her arrive.... wishing her a safe drive back home  Thanks for the info Wayne
279664,irishfield,2008-12-14 23:36:00,26272,"Yah.. she's a keeper leechman... I was supposed to go get our daughter, but she told me to go to Niagara instead!  Back to you Tom.... cold yet? ... get the beer truck emptied so it was easier to push?"
279679,Greencoachdog,2008-12-15 00:07:00,8163,Y'all are Canadian     ... get used to it already!!!
279698,irishfield,2008-12-15 00:32:00,26272,I hear ya Dawg..... that's why I bought that house down the street and across from you with the For Sale sign on the front lawn!
