279469,bassjnkie,2008-12-14 16:43:00,1101,Does anyone recall when they did it last year? I have a few working reels to give up.
279496,MCTFisher9120,2008-12-14 17:12:00,3761,"I think it was during the spring fishing classic they have every year, but not 100% sure."
279502,bassjnkie,2008-12-14 17:35:00,1101,"Cool, Thanks  Daniel"
279503,bucktail,2008-12-14 17:36:00,1857,Yep spring fishing classic it is!
279520,Guest skeeter99,2008-12-14 18:03:00,0,"hate to burst the bubble  but I believe as of last years spring sale they discontinued the reel trade in  my friend who is a shimano rep and is placed in the store during the sale told me last year if I remeber correctly cause he told me to order off website in u.s. cause the reel I wanted was cheaper  and if you have not noticed the canoe at the front of the store full of old reels, that is always usually out all year round is gone!!!   but hey I could be wrong or they may have brought it back due to popular demand"
279943,smbhunter,2008-12-15 18:05:00,186,"The reel trade in, as always, is still going on every year during the spring fishing classic. Last year they shortened it from being the entire length of the classic, to only about 4 days in total. It was never stopped. The coupon values haven't changed either. Not quite sure what is going to happen this classic with the reel trade in, whether it will be the length of the classic or if it will be shortened, but it will be going on."
279944,bassjnkie,2008-12-15 18:14:00,1101, Thank you for the info. I knew the trade in's are very successful and I couldn't see BPS eliminating it completely.  Thanks again Daniel
279948,Handlebarz,2008-12-15 18:25:00,3790,does anyone have any info on the trades from before? I have some old ones to get rid of.
279990,GoneFishin,2008-12-15 22:25:00,349," I would also like to know. I have a curado that I would like to trade in, but I'm not just going to give it away for 20% off or something"
280015,salmon,2008-12-15 23:17:00,334,"Here you go guys, this was from there add. last year. Last time I took advantage of the sale, there was a table with entry level spincast reels you can buy. I think it was 5 or 10 dollars, buy them and trade them in for a credit note on your new reels. Not sure if they have the spincast reel table this year or not.    Jose"
280020,Handlebarz,2008-12-15 23:38:00,3790,thanks for the reply I was wondering if they donate them to people who dont have rods and reels? if so that is a  good program
280025,salmon,2008-12-15 23:44:00,334," From the flyer: ""All trade ins are donated to local youth organizations to help with their outdoor educational programs""  Jose"
