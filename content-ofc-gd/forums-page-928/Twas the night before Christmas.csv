Cuddy, Ph.D.  December 15, 2008 NewsWithViews.com    Twas            the night before Christmas, and with great elation, Barack Obama was planning to ""change"" the nation. Corporate stockings were hung at the Congress with care in the hopes that bailouts soon would be there. The public was nestled all snug in their beds, while visions of tax cuts danced in their heads. Women in their kerchiefs and men in their caps had unfortunately settled for political c___. When over the airwaves there arose such a clatter, people sprang from their lethargy to see what was the matter. Away to the TV, they flew like a flash, heard economic bad news and feared for their cash. Stocks on the Dow hit a new fallen low, creating more fears down the tubes we would go. When what to our tearful eyes should appear but Congressional leaders allaying our fears. With their leader Obama so lively and quick, we knew in a moment there must be a fix. More rapid than politicians fleeing all blame, Barack whistled and called his allies by name. Now Daschle, now Geithner, nor Gates and Biden, on Rahm, on Pelosi, on Reid and Clinton (Hillary). To the ""top of the world,"" we heard him call, ""Proclaim our agenda, ""Socialism for all!""â€¦ Obama flashing his smile spoke in such prose that the world was in awe at this king that arose. He sprang to his throne, to his team gave a whistle. National sovereignty was gone without the firing of missiles. But I heard him exclaim from his lofty height, Now I possess such great power, there's no use to fight (it)!  "
