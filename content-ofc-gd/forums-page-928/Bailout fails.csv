279488,forrest,2008-12-14 16:58:00,1032," That comment of yours is as informed at your confusion between ""The Mob"" a criminal organization and ""a mob"" a common collective (and your other spoutings)  I do not work in the auto industry or at line worker job.  If the big 3 sink it is not likely to affect me in a big way.  Where is the game ward en?  Someone is trolling in a troll free zone!  forrest"
279493,outllaw,2008-12-14 17:07:00,1232,"chris s. its unfortunate your area has lost jobs. i would have rather seen it healthy. the facts are the manufacturing base is very large . in automobiles its a huge picture. . my question is where did those jobs from the eastern side of ontario go. offshore???.  the economy could not withstand a wipeout of the automakers. whether we like it or not everyone feels the pinch. chris if you saw the windsor area decimation from all closures, many many not even related to automobiles you would see the downside. . some say re-locate. the western provinces are drying up for jobs, or cost of living dictates  huge salaries to make a living, aka ,rent food. . i could tell you i have lived thru downturns and reccesions from living a little longer then some on this board. whats goverments to do with monies collected from workers. pay welfare or do the right thing and help its citizens. im quite sure there will be the folks drooling to pick this apart. but it is what it is. the manufacturing base is far to valuabale to fail in north america.. when folks run out of unemployment be prepared to watch your tax base shrink, welfare explode. unfortanetly theres many seniors like myself that canot return to work. what about them. they built this country like you are now. so in closing i surmise if your older collecting a pension screw us. sad how canadas turned. when i grew up it was about us, not a ME society."
279512,Spiel,2008-12-14 17:52:00,9065,....I think this has come about as far as it can. Now if you'll excuse me I have some rods to build and that is indeed fishing related.
279450,Zebco,2008-12-14 16:21:00,123,"  You sure are full of yourself.  All these troops over in Afganistan making far less then you, they couldn't hold a candle to Canada's Finest Sirfishalot!  I'm sure there allergic to work aswell.   Maybe your kids play ps3 all day, mine likes swimming and soccer.   Not my fault you said you been working since the 80's at GM and still don't have your house paid for.   What did you do with all your money?  I would be sweating now too....  You tell me my assumption about people over 55 is just an assumption then you go make a remark about people under 30.  My father is 60, hardest worker I ever met.  Even he agrees that the Big 3 makes way more $ then there worth!   His house is paid for and he never worked at GM hmm."

279049,forrest,2008-12-13 16:44:00,1032," I back that up too.  It happens all the time, it is an easy ting to fall into.  Money is good and the job is there.  Some say 'I'll just do it for a year or so to get out of debt'.  Next thing they know its 10 years and they no longer have the freedom of a 20 year old.

279052,Zebco,2008-12-13 16:51:00,123,"Lot of wasted space as well as wasted money.  If all these assembly line workers are such genius's why did they let this happen?  Can they not vote for a pay cut to equal the foriegn competitors?  I'm sure they can, just chose not too.  Look at all the things they have went on strike for in the past, seems they always get there way, now there crying cause they might not get there way.  Boo-Hoo  Welcome to the real World!"

It is a hopeless cause so the talent has to go with the flow.  Put yourself on the ladder: For the longest time there has been less qualified people higher up the ladder and more qualified people lower on the ladder.  It sucks, the world is not fair.

279063,Zebco,2008-12-13 17:47:00,123,"  Comparing autoworkers with the Mob, is like comparing Paris hilton to Charlie manson. I am on the ladder taking a 10 percent pay cut beginning in Febuary for these pampered workers at gm.  Most of my co-workers will be laid off...  Like I said welcome to the real world.  I been in it for awhile, never got handed a job to me because I was born at the right time..."
279065,outllaw,2008-12-13 17:50:00,1232,zebco . you state workers to change what a company dictates. the unions have given up lots in the past contracts.. yes fish farmer its a closed border to quality north american products. in the meantime our resources get sucked dry.. and zebco. do you really think the asian markets shop at your local stores???.
279069,Zebco,2008-12-13 18:01:00,123,"I inspect parts for GM and want them to fall, if you think they are quality parts you are nuts or work for GM.  Pretty much every part on 2009's V-8 engines have had something wrong with them at one point or another this year.  Thats just there motor...  Little things like hinges can't even be made right.  They are made in Niagara Falls Canada.  The weather stripping made in welland is being sent away cause they can't do there jobs.  I won't name the companies.  Nothing is made by GM all they do is put the car together so how is it a GM vehicle?  Alot of parts come from Mexico aswell, some from Poland, Germany and so on.  How is that a North American made car?  So there is your quality..  If they actually made a quality vehicle my opinion would be different on the bail out..."

279075,sirfish,2008-12-13 18:18:00,175," You're not taking a pay cut for GM workers . Shake your head. You are taking a pay cut so your corporate  bosses can maintain thier standard as to what they are used to. It always boils down to the guy at the top of the pyramid.  For the record...I applied every year from 79 to 84 before I was hired. In the interim it was school and work.......so what was handed to me ...I think i paid my dues  All last year it was easy to blame the oil companies ,now with the low oil prices its the Autoworker to point the finger at. ......When this blows over who will you naysayers point the finger at...United way ? welfare recipients? Handicapped persons ?  Have you no consience .  Its easy to follow a crowd and believe what they say without all the facts."
279077,misfish,2008-12-13 18:19:00,29133," If they would just ease up on thier tight tolerances,I bet it would work. I have seen the pressure a customer  can put on us. A part that really dosent need to be as tight in spec,they will not budge(a simple bracket for grips sake). I laugh inside ,as not to be disrespectful to our customers,but even so,we do the best we can, making it the way they want,but it dose come at a price. Everything these days is made with aslittle material as possible. When we build dies,we have to make them,so there is little waste of the material. Scrap prices have dropped to a low again. There was a time where scrap was worth more then the parts we made.  Another example is,we punch parts for a company. When we build the die, we are held to very tight specs.When we run a die that was shipped to us from them,the parts are crap,but thats ok. What ever."
279078,BUSTER,2008-12-13 18:19:00,1336,"I agree with the statement of"" if they actually made a quality vehicle my opinion would be different on the bail out"" i own a silverado 4x4  and if i was to list the problems i've had my hands would cramp from typing, i agree and disagree  with many comments but i cant comment on all,keep the opinions and comments comming just respect others feelings on the topic, may not be fishing but alot of fisherman  drive these cars and or work for these car makers or part makers.. lots of passion in the comments."
279080,sirfish,2008-12-13 18:31:00,175," Wow where do you get your facts !!! GM St Catharines has the highest quality for all of NAO. with a 95% first time quality rating and rising in plant. GDX in Welland where weatherstripping is made for a multitude of vehicles ,domestic and foriegn was the most efficient and fully agile of all the other plants . The only reason for the downsizing is new ownership not based in Canada. As for the hinges i don't know the facts so I won't comment.  Its funny you would want them to fail..YOU WOULD BE OUT OF WORK and a burden to society IE ...UNEMPLOYMENT or worse WELFARE...  DUH"
278743,cram,2008-12-12 19:22:00,1733,"  I fall into none of the 3 categories...certainly don't enjoy the misfortune of others, have not yet been that hurt in the economic downturn, and don't care about the lowered prices (they'll actually go up with inflation if the fundamentals ever catch up to the US dollar being printed like newspaper).  Anyway -- the companies are not competitive. Not at all. Why aren't they competitive?  They seem to use the additional labour costs as a crutch to explain the reason , so why is it not fair for us to comment on those?  As a side note, i think their problems have as much to do with business model and product quality (vs. labour costs), but anyway....  btw ...is ontario really the leader in automobile production?  That's really interesting - had no idea.   Does that # incorporate magna etc, or just the big 3 + honda autoplants?"
278745,The Urban Fisherman,2008-12-12 19:30:00,2050,"People are entitled to their opinions, whether they're educated enough to give a proper opinion or not is another story.  I don't have a degree in economics, so at the end of the day my opinion on this matter means squat.  I'd like to think that the majority of the population isn't selfish enough to just think of themselves, and what they gain or lose from this whole thing.  I say, speak your mind, respect other peoples views, like them or not, and whatever the outcome might be, work together for a better tomorrow!  I know I'm just going to kick back, enjoy this thread to it's fullest, and hope it doesn't get to the point where it has to be locked.  Cheers, UF  Ps.

278750,cram,2008-12-12 19:46:00,1733, True.  Question -- what would be wrong with letting them go bankrupt and restructure their businesses to become competitive?
278757,LeXXington,2008-12-12 20:20:00,1928," You are correct, The unions did not want too take the pay cuts until 2011.. Good things its 2008 and they have the hat in hand now.  The sticking point on the wage was that the Goverement wanted the unions too agree to the same wages as Toyota about $2.00 less!!  2007 labor agreements by shifting responsibility for retiree health care to union-controlled trust funds. But those changes won't take effect until 2010.  AGAIN .. Note the 2010!!!  Tell me why you would put everyone at risk over that, it sounds very resonable! They are in trouble now and need to be fxied before they get taxpayer $$"
278758,Anton Kanagasuntheri,2008-12-12 20:22:00,160,  Cram...Apparently asking someone to have solid business governance and always plan for the future is very wrong!!! Where will the union bosses go if you have to compete in a market?? What will happen to all the $30.00 /12hr shift jobs?? Imagine a North American cooperate world with a competitive edge?? No way man… otherwise what will happen to my uncle who makes $34.00/hr sitting at the TTC ticket counter at Bay and Bloore handing out tokens……
278760,Terry,2008-12-12 20:24:00,14456,"I know that no one wants to take a pay cut, but when they close the doors and all these unskilled works wake up to the real world and find out they can only find jobs that pay between 12 and 18 bucks with little if any benefits, they are going to hope for a do over....."
278765,misfish,2008-12-12 20:32:00,29133,"  Interesting you stated this bud. I was just going to post a question.  How many of the workers would like to have a vote on a wage reduction? I mean, how many really have thier faith in the union. Just because they are paying them(dues),dosent mean they trust them. If it were I,you bet,if it meant keeping my job,I would except a pay cut. Was talking to the guy that picks up our steel scrap today. You be amazed at how many are worried about this. Losing everything."
278768,LeXXington,2008-12-12 20:41:00,1928," None of the above,  I see it as the UAW/CAW will be the most affected as these represent most of the workers. I question if they would do this too the point of putting the average worker out of a job.  The big 3 should be doing what ever they can to save off going defunk.  If I was an employee I would be thinking..  what can I do too save my job NOW not honour the current contract for a few more years. I wonder in the next contract if the union did not like it would they go on strike??  You can't ask people making $15 a hour to tay higher taxes so a worker that does not want too change can keep his\her job.  If the auto giants built great reliable cars, kept cost's in check,  and changed with the times they would not be in this mess.  We need a viable auto induestry not one that bleeds the province only in the end too move too mexico cause of lower wages  I am anti-union and proud of it."
278771,LeXXington,2008-12-12 20:46:00,1928,"Just wanted too add,  We can all agree to disagree I am not slagging anyone and feel for the families affected.  I just like the discussion."
278849,Bernie,2008-12-12 22:45:00,3190,It wasn't too many years ago the OMC guys didn't want to concede anything either. Where are they now? Many other company's bought up the sections of the technology. They hired some of the former employees-but only a fraction.
278859,misfish,2008-12-12 23:11:00,29133,"Well, looks like they our govermnet, ""WILL"" bail them out. Just heard it."
278641,Rich,2008-12-12 14:56:00,3927,"All I have to say is.. I have friends at my work who were working in factories locally. Got laid off, can't find work. They were making really good money, 30/hr or more doing what they did. Industry crumbled, now they work with me for next to minimum wage.  They whine.. but overall, they adapted and overcame it. Less money isn't a death sentence."
278644,Marko,2008-12-12 15:00:00,854,MIllions or billions whats the difference.....just couple of zeroes lol. Jokes aside the situation looks fairly bleak for auto industry in canada. Maybe the outlook would be a bit better if GM made car that you can rely on for couple of year and not worry about changing parts after months of use.
278647,ricoboxing,2008-12-12 15:02:00,398,"once Obama takes power, there is no way he is not gonna bail out the people that voted him in. so yes, it's just a commercial break."
