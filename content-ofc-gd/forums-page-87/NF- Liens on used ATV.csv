I see that you can do an online lien search, but a someone I know told me that he did that (vin was clear) and had a bailiff show up to repo his machine because the previous owner put up the machine for collateral when he got a loan for a house reno. He lost his job and couldnt make payments.. Is there any truth to this...and how do you avoid it?"
1008726,Old Ironmaker,2017-07-12 01:38:00,8243,"Wouldn't the MOT show a lien on the title. That was the way it used to be. No title, no sale. Read my bi line at the bottom of this page."
1008727,atvaholic,2017-07-12 01:59:00,271,"I thought that's the way it was too. But someone told me it is not. If the owner bought the ATV, then later put it up to get another loan, it does not show up on the title - but you may be on the hook for it..or so they say."
1008729,Old Ironmaker,2017-07-12 03:10:00,8243,The loan company will notify the MOT for any loan where a registered vehicle is used as collateral. If they don't the owner can sell and they may never get there money. That I know. If the MOT says it is clear that would be good for me.

1008734,spooner_jr,2017-07-12 11:17:00,193,The UVIP will show if there is a lien on the vehicle.  You can get it at the MTO with the VIN for the atv.
