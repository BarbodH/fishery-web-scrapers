1008854,GBW,2017-07-13 19:52:00,8460,I haven't been in years but I recall it wasn't a huge lot.  If it's a nice forecast then you are taking chances as it may fill up quick JB.  Also keep that extra few min for the Shawa as a back up plan.  Good luck
1008869,FloatnFly,2017-07-14 00:16:00,1640,"you'll have space to park, its a pretty decent sized lot now"
1008877,Sinker,2017-07-14 01:18:00,8692,"Yup, big lot, no worries.  S."
1008985,ccmtcanada,2017-07-15 01:36:00,7971,Yep.  It's big now!
