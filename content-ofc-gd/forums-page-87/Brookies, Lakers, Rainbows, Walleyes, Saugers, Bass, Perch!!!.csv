As for not many commenting on this, well just like Misfish's recent poll, most members prefer a picture/text report over a video report. I get it, different strokes for different folks.   Dude that's awesome. Catch a bunch of fish, write songs about fishing, post them on the internet.  Where do I learn to be this cool?  PS: that was a huge brookie. J'ai capotter  LOL, great comment from A-Z. Thank you sir!   Great video and catches! Thanks for sharing! Just imagine how many more fish you would have caught had you not had a banana in the boat! HH Thanks and LOL, I had to go through the video again to see where there was a banana in the boat. Funny thing is that day the fish were on fire! Must be because of that banana attractant."

I will continue to mix up written/pics reports as well as these video reports. It's fun to switch things up every once in a while."
