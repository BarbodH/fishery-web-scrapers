1008766,Tjames09,2017-07-12 16:39:00,664,"I saw a big OFC sign and an OFC bass boat on Sturgeon lake this past weekend (July 8th and 9th). I didnt see anything on this board about it, and I cant see OFC standing for anything else in fishing world.  They were staying at Fish N rest resort cottages."
1008793,Old Ironmaker,2017-07-13 00:43:00,8243,You weren't invited either TJ?
1008800,bigugli,2017-07-13 01:53:00,6138,There is another OFC (Ontario Fishing Club) on facebook.
1008801,GBW,2017-07-13 02:09:00,8460,There is another OFC (Ontario Fishing Club) on facebook. Yes and I won't go there as they are a joke to say the least...
1008804,Rwm,2017-07-13 02:26:00,6,Yeah i agree with GBW stay right away from Ontario Fishing Club on Facebook nothing but bad news.
1008812,Sinker,2017-07-13 13:09:00,8692,"Any explanation as to why you would say that? I can't say I agree or disagree, but I do follow their page and don't see what the issue is?  S."
1008858,Toronto_Angler,2017-07-13 21:16:00,698,"Any explanation as to why you would say that? I can't say I agree or disagree, but I do follow their page and don't see what the issue is?  S. Would also like an explanation"
1008866,Rwm,2017-07-13 22:42:00,6,All i am going to say is to ask around the fishing community as i am not the o ly one that feels this way
1008876,Old Ironmaker,2017-07-14 01:15:00,8243,This is the fishing community. I don't think it's fair to slam an entire group without explanation.
1008903,HTHM,2017-07-14 04:51:00,4082,This is the fishing community. I don't think it's fair to slam an entire group without explanation. Well said!
1008904,Big Cliff,2017-07-14 09:00:00,6899,"Well I think they could have chosen a slightly different name and wonder if it was an attempt to capitalize on the popularity of the OFC logo, pretty smart from a commercial stand point. Apart from that I really don't see any issues but then again I haven't had any involvement with them."
1008906,Rwm,2017-07-14 10:41:00,6,Its not the group itself that is bad news it are the ones that run the group i was actually talking about. If people only knew what actually goes on but not my place to say so like i say ask around you never know what you will learn
1008916,Tjames09,2017-07-14 12:25:00,664,"Oh didnt know there was another group. They had a nice bass boat with the logo on it. Seemed like a lot of people were at this event, cant be all that bad news if they had a lot of people out for a weekend of fishing."
1008917,Big Cliff,2017-07-14 12:30:00,6899,"If you have something to say and proof that what you say is true then you should say it, otherwise your comments don't hold much value."
1008921,porkpie,2017-07-14 13:21:00,2521,Club drama!
1008923,hirk,2017-07-14 13:25:00,571,Im curious too?
1008959,Old Ironmaker,2017-07-14 21:14:00,8243,"Like Albert says ""hey look, a can of worms, let's open it."""
1008960,Rwm,2017-07-14 21:23:00,6,Just dont like how they treated some kids with some of the comments they made
