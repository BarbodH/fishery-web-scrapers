Ive been spending my evenings at murrays canal on both trenton side and brighton side with very little to show for it . only caught rock bass basically.i use to do okay on myers pier but the water levels right now make it almost impossible to fish it right now . any help would be great. looking for someone to go out with aswel as usually its just me unless the wife tags along and brings a book.

Lot's of bass still around the weed beds on the bay side of the Canal. Good luck! I might make my way out this weekend with the lil'guy.
