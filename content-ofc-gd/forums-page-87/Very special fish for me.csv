I saw em every day... I would leave spots and guys would go and catch behind me... I'd leave spots and see John Anderson (awesome guide) hit it after me... etc... etc...  July I'm on a weekend swing and have Wednesday and Thursday off all month so I set my eyes on going to the Ottawa every week while it is quiet mid week to break the curse  Yesterday about 6 hours into our day a hot little musky charged my cowgirl and to my surprise this one actually went into the figure 8 and it was HOT HOT HOT!!! On the second lap around it hit and I missed... I was absolutely gutted cause I thought it was over... to my surprise it kept going and hit again on the 4th lap around the figure 8 and I got the hooks in  My partner had never seen a figure 8 strike and I only have a couple under my belt as well so we both went crazy  I was yelling ""get the net... the curse is broken!!!""  That's when I realized my partner couldn't figure out my folding net  Again I was gutted thinking I was gunna lose the fish that took 5 years to catch  In the end we got it in the bag and the curse is finally broken  Now keep in mind  I've caught musky up to 56 inches before but this little thirty-something fish is one of the most exciting... memorable... and hard earned fish of my life and I don't think I'll ever forget it   "

1008978,Gallie,2017-07-15 00:12:00,1215,Nice fish mike! Always feels good to beat a skunk!
1008987,buick14,2017-07-15 01:40:00,741,"That doesn't look like a 30 something, unless u mean 39+  Nice fish , way to go.  I feel that way when I catch a 3 lb bass in some rivers around my cottage that I stumble across.   I Get Very happy!  Good job."
1008991,J Roelofsen,2017-07-15 02:26:00,84,"What a way to break the curse!  we'll all vouch if you call her an even 40""  Good looking fish...  Josh"
1008992,Rattletrap2,2017-07-15 02:34:00,1652,Congrats and thanks for sharing the story with us! Awesome!
1008995,BlueEye,2017-07-15 02:47:00,338,Nice fish Mike!!
1008997,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2017-07-15 03:15:00,535,"Now the floodgates open! Persistence pays off, nice to see ya get the monkey off your back Mike."
1009003,Old Ironmaker,2017-07-15 04:48:00,8243,"Wowza Mike Wowza. You need a new tape measure, yours has stretched. That's no 30, 39 maybe, maybe even more. It looks as big as the 49 I caught (insert winky yellow thing here) I saw a 29"" Pic last week, that fish is 10"" longer, at least.  I don't Musky fish but from watching all the shows and talking to those that do go for them Crocs no one has ever told me nor have I ever seen one hit a figure 8, ever.  edit: tried the 8 thing on a Smallie follower once and it actually worked. That day they were jumping in the boat. I have a witness."
1009011,mike rousseau,2017-07-15 09:37:00,4661,Thanks everyone  As far as the length goes I guessed high 30s  It's a good pic and if it wasn't in the 30s it couldn't have been far into the 40s  I don't really measure musky until I think they are high 40s or into the 50s and this little guy didn't stop fighting when it got in the net so I wanted to limit time out of water  It rolled and tangled... had to cut all the hooks... I got cut by a tooth as well as rakers... lol  This little guy had character
1009019,mistaredone,2017-07-15 12:18:00,913,5 years!!!  Man your stubborn. No better way to break the skunk than a figure 8 Muskie. Congrats

1009042,mike rousseau,2017-07-15 16:28:00,4661,I know right  Especially cause I can catch musky most days 15 minutes from my house on the St. Lawrence River  It was like an itch I had to scratch
1009051,misfish,2017-07-15 19:14:00,29133,"I can relate after this weeks fish.   Nice accomplishment Mike  Thats a nice one. Size at times, dosent matter."
