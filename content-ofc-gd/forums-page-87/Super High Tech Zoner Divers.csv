1008387,Sterling,2017-07-07 15:28:00,477,"Saw these on youtube and was intrigued: http://www.liquidzone.fi/index.php/    Zoner divers are like electronic dipsies that take your lure to a specified depth or temperature.  Pros; Cons; Thoughts??? Anyone have experience with these units? I've read some scattered threads about these units and it seems there is lots of positive feedback, but very little traction, possibly due to price."
1008484,wdodgetruck,2017-07-09 12:30:00,27,They have been around for a few years . Does anyone know if there a any dealers in Ontario ?
1008485,dave524,2017-07-09 12:41:00,4508,"Saw some old posts about them, 2013 , said Josh at Angling Outfitters in Woodstock would be the Canadian Dealer, might want to check with him and see what became of that."
1008504,NANUK,2017-07-09 22:52:00,797,Last price mentioned on spoonpullers was around $300 Cdn Ouch !
1008515,Old Ironmaker,2017-07-10 01:15:00,8243,"I was all excited until I saw the price. But then again I have never lost a Dipsy or Jet Diver before. Featherstone Ted got a temp probe a few years ago for the downrigger. I couldn't believe the immediate increase in hook ups here on Erie and Lake O, find the thermocline, find the fish. But at 300 bananas I would need more feedback from someone that uses them. But after all 300 bucks is only 1/2 a Tackle Mate box of spoons and plugs, or a rod and reel, or less than 2 tanks of fuel or........ If they do work as advertised I would most likely get one. I would love to know what Josh of Angling Outfitters thinks of them. His word to me is golden. I have never had any luck with electronics under water lasting.  edit: watched a few pitches on You Tube. I have more questions now than answers. Need to give Angling a call. If they carry them I will take a ride one of these windy days. Which is almost everyday this season."
1008664,BillM,2017-07-11 14:00:00,17367,With my luck I'd lose them.  No thanks.
1008740,Sterling,2017-07-12 12:36:00,477,"Last price mentioned on spoonpullers was around $300 Cdn Ouch !  $200 if you order a pair direct from them. Not like that's cheap either LOL  Old Ironmaker: I contacted Angling Outfitters, they don't carry these nor can they remember doing so."
1008751,porkpie,2017-07-12 14:27:00,2521,For that kind of cash I'd probably save up and invest in a fishawk.  Mind you it hurts pretty bad if you lose a probe there too!
1008757,Old Ironmaker,2017-07-12 15:30:00,8243,"Thanks Sterling. I talked to a guy yesterday that is a serious long liner and he told us that his buddy ought 2 and they are not as advertised. The electronics broke down after a season of use so they were just 400 bucks of plastic. Enough info for me. Like all my expensive lures I would be so afraid of loosing them I wouldn't even take them on the boat. My goodness I am turning into my Father, that's both his and my Moms logic."
1008806,Freshtrax,2017-07-13 02:44:00,2215,I get the hebejebes just having my probe down. They look cool I like the undulating thing too bad there soon expensive and unreliable.
