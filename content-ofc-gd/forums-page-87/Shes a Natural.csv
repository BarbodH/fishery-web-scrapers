First trip, we headed out to Scugog with a bucket of worms and a loyal friend.  After a frustrating 30 minutes of fish peeling worms off of hooks, and me realizing I left the smaller hook at home, I decided break into my fly box, tied a black wooley bugger under the float, and tipped with a very small piece of worm, the results were immediate success.  The first fish had the pups attention as he wondered what the heck just came out of his giant swimming pool, and why was it moving...   From there, my daughter stole the show!     After getting over her initial fear, she made some new 'friends'      And to top off the day, she pulled this beauty out the pond! her first one and hopefully many more!     Definitely not a bad way to spend a morning!"
