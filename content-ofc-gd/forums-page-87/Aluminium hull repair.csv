1008180,oldphart,2017-07-04 12:52:00,665,"~~~I had an 18"" crack down the center of my bow, and I finally went and had it welded, by a guy in Bowmanville named Garrnett, he did a great job, and the cost was reasonable. You can contact him at [emailÂ protected], or call 289-314-6660, if asked tell it was the guy with the Tracker"
1008440,Rizzo,2017-07-08 12:40:00,4754,"""if asked tell it was the guy with the Tracker""   ...ya I bet he has only ever worked on one tracker with a cracked hull"
1008590,Sinker,2017-07-10 20:02:00,8692,"Can you access the hole from the inside and out? It might not be too hard to repair. A few rivets, some 3M 5200, and a piece of aluminum big enough to cover the hole/crack.  Pics would help.  S."
1008596,DanD,2017-07-10 20:47:00,2223,"There are closed end pop rivets, if you cannot get to the hole from the inside. Not as strong as a regular rivet, that needs to be bucked. So I would bump up the size of the rivet to get better clamping force. If by chance this damage is a crack; it would be good to drill a hole at either end of the crack. That will usually stop the crack from growing longer.  Dan."
1008599,Old Ironmaker,2017-07-10 20:54:00,8243,"Whatever you do never fill the boat with water to find any leaks.  Where are you located? There is crack aluminum guy out here that does great work. Jarvis, Haldimand County, Lake Erie. I think Fish Farmer has used him.  I hope the boat isn't a Cracker, errrr I mean Tracker."
1008645,FloatnFly,2017-07-11 02:53:00,1640,"Canadian Elite Welded Products in Whitby, they do tons of aluminum welding, and lots of boat repairs"
1008652,msp,2017-07-11 12:08:00,1336,"Thanks for all your replies. Turns out that there is not damage to the hull. The front deck shifted in the accident. Damage to the winch mast, tongue but not the hull. I fixed everything myself. Thanks to Princess auto !"

1008752,Pigeontroller,2017-07-12 14:32:00,2793,Whatever you do never fill the boat with water to find any leaks.    Can you elaborate on this?
1008754,DanD,2017-07-12 14:48:00,2223,"10 pounds per gallon X's how many gallons? That puts a lot of weight in a boat, that's sitting on a trailer; only supported in a few relatively small areas.  Dan."
