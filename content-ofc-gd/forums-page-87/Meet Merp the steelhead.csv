He had a total blast bringing this fish in. We get it in the net and my friend starts saying "" ITS A MERP!!! ITS A MERP!! WTH is a Merp?  This is Merp the walleye http://magazine.fishsens.com/merp-the-walleye-a-strange-hybrid-fish.htm  This is Merp the steelhead. Anyone ever caught a Merp? "

1008397,OhioFisherman,2017-07-07 18:31:00,6623,"LOL, looks like he tried to ram a boat!  At one area of Lake Erie I fished a number of good sized smallies had one eye where the color seemed to have run together, no visible damage to the eye area, but I am guessing they were blind in that eye, it didn't affect their ability to find a lure!"
