The spot i'm on is a very well known local go to and the nearest camp always has a few boats there whenever I'm there. This being said I have had nobody fishing the spot i'm on all week....lol....but the video is a dead giveaway of where I am on the Island so should be interesting to see how many boats migrate from their usual spots close to the island out to where I was. I am going back tonight and I know that the nearby camp watches my videos....almost sure of it....and I know that at least 30 locals watch them. WATCH THIS SPACE. SOCIAL MEDIA EXPERIMENT IN PROGRESS!  "

1008453,limeyangler,2017-07-08 16:29:00,5204,"Awesome! Love the experiment   On 2 separate occasions the wive's of two locals have approached my wife to tell her that they laugh at their husbands because they spend hours stopping and starting the videos looking for landmarks and trying to triangulate my position with where the sun is etc..etc..and using google earth.  It kind of irks me because never have I ever had one comment on my youtube channel from anyone local. It is hilarious to see the embarrassed faces of parents (males) when their kids run up to me and say ""My dad watches all of your videos!"" but that person has never approached me to say hi or anything, even funnier when I have had numerous conversations with them while waiting to pick up the kids and not a mention of my videos. Most likely these are some of the people in town who frown on my videos for potentially giving away my location, yet here they are taking advantage of the very thing they all get their knickers in a twist about...lol."

Pay no mind Simon. The vids are for you and your family and friends to ENJOY and REMEMBER.  Some will never get it.  Enjoyed."

I was like ""nope, best spot around is about 1000 yards away from the dock""  So we stop in there, within an hour of absolutely smashing walleye we got about 10 boats around. All American(not that that really matters) just kinda funny they come all that way to fish 1000 yards off the government dock lol  MNR was out big time too. Two boats hauled off for drinking  Was kinda funny because IM not used to getting crowded or poached up here unless it's winter."
