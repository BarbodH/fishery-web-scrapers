1008503,Rodbender,2017-07-09 22:02:00,1027,Great vid Brian nice fish too
1008505,dave524,2017-07-09 22:59:00,4508,"Nice pond  , local ponds as a kid were but a fraction that size and full of stunted bluegills if you were lucky, that's some fishery."
1008520,Acountdeleted,2017-07-10 02:22:00,2562,Oh man. Looks like a blast. And good choice of tunes as well. Enjoy the travels.
1008525,Old Ironmaker,2017-07-10 02:46:00,8243,"That video has me thinking about getting up early tomorrow, very nice work Sir. But I would need to find somewhere without waves crashing.  Nothing better, fishing at least, than hitting glass like waters with top water at daybreak or even dusk. I have to say it has to be my favorite type of fishing. Looks like you had a great morning. I have a black skirted top water buzz bait that just hammers both Bass and Pike, once even a nice Pic on the Ottawa. I've had it for years. Same axe, different head different handle if you know what I mean.  There are a few ponds out this way that were abandoned quarries that were filled and stocked with game fish. They have basically been fished out in the last few years once the word got out on the internet. A local that I worked with says people would come from as far as Toronto and keep each and every fish they caught, no matter size or species. They would bring along several kids and stick a toy rod I their hands and count fish towards their limit. A joke. Why the County never made it C&R I will never know. I'm not sure that would deter these guys. Sad to see."
1008558,blaque,2017-07-10 14:52:00,2419,Great morning out for sure.  I miss fishing all the local ponds i grew up with.......unfortunately the access over the years has diminished and most of them get so choked with growth by July that they arent even fishable anymore. Im talking much smaller ponds than the one your on however.......thats a big arse pond lol
1008574,CoolB,2017-07-10 16:31:00,47,Came to say the same as Blaque. That's a big arse pond.  Great vid Brian. Been so long I almost forgot what you looked like.
1008618,Tom S,2017-07-10 23:40:00,362,I believe you had a goal to break out the fly rod for bass this year? Next time pack a 7wt and some deerhair poppers for your topwater action and hold on.
1008713,aplumma,2017-07-11 21:18:00,6896,Nice day on the water Brian. Thanks for sharing.  Art
