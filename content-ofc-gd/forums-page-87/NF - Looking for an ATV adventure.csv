1008165,atvaholic,2017-07-04 02:20:00,271,"Hi,  Some friends and I want to do a small little adventure. We are ""intermediate"" skill level, but looking to do a 2 - 3 day trip. Nothing too extreme. Maybe staying at lodges each night. 2 - 3 hour from Toronto would be nice. Just want to know if you have any suggestions..?"
1008183,Fisherman,2017-07-04 13:31:00,7201,Central Ontario ATV club has gone here before and really liked it so much they are going back again for a weekend stay.  http://www.mattawaadventurecamp.com/
1008425,atvaholic,2017-07-08 00:02:00,271,Thanks fisherman! Seems like a good place. Is it suitable for a family stay too?
1008426,Fisherman,2017-07-08 00:42:00,7201,"Very much so. Don't know if you're on facebook, you can check their site, there's a lot of pictures and comments. https://www.facebook.com/MattawaAdventureCamp/?hc_ref=NEWSFEED"
1008432,Woodsman,2017-07-08 09:35:00,1286,I just got back from an ATV trip staying in Tweed at the Park Place Motel. Once there you don't have the load your ATV up to go to the trails or even through town. I traveled eastward the first day and westward the second day. Covered 150 km's day one return. Second day 95 km's return. Basically rail trails but through some nice country.  https://www.facebook.com/rick.ball.351/posts/10154961139683920?pnref=story

1008480,Woodsman,2017-07-09 07:45:00,1286,The rooms were your classic motel rooms & very clean. I plan on returning next year. Maybe even a fall trip when the leaves are turning.
