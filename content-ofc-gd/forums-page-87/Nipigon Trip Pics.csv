It was no problem at all getting in so makes me wonder if the complainers were driving in Ferraris??  http://i123.photobucket.com/albums/o316/sterios/nipigon%20234_zpsc15fs5hg.jpg  Saw a bunch of these guys  http://i123.photobucket.com/albums/o316/sterios/nipigon%20417_zpsfhaay30o.jpg  Personal best Brook Trout  http://i123.photobucket.com/albums/o316/sterios/nipigon%20445_zpsddsyevaw.jpg  Three whities all the same size in 10 feet of water!  http://i123.photobucket.com/albums/o316/sterios/nipigon%20259_zpsr4gnmis5.jpg  All the other pics where the usual trees, rocks and water. Don't hesitate to go up the Lake Nipigon if the chance presents itself. It is a great place to camp and fish and you really feel you are 'out there'"
1008295,misfish,2017-07-05 23:40:00,29133,PB is  a pain in the ass. Hope you dont mind the help floater. Sweet fish.          
1008309,BillM,2017-07-06 03:11:00,17367,"I hate those shallow water whities, always think they are brookies until I see their backs, lol."
1008313,Freshtrax,2017-07-06 05:46:00,2215,Nice pics.  Love it up there.
1008330,Reef Runner,2017-07-06 15:36:00,980,On the bucket list; sweet pics.
1008347,Moosebunk,2017-07-06 19:44:00,3970,"Lord I love that lake!  Great shots floater.  You're hooked now, you'll go back.  So much to explore in that area."
1008352,floater,2017-07-06 20:32:00,220,Looking for a bigger boat already! The 14 foot tinny with the 30 was great for near shore but I really want to explore more. In the first pic you can see where I mounted the oars 'outboard' of the boat. This set up worked great! They were out of the way and didn't even move when splashed and banged around. Planning on a fall trip for about 4 or 5 days. Robert said the Brookie fishing is even better then.
1008354,BillM,2017-07-06 21:08:00,17367,"I think I'll be doing a solo trip up there in a next few weeks, can't wait to get back."
1008412,Walleye'm Fishing,2017-07-07 21:49:00,310,"Great stuff man, congrats on your PB"
1008471,Joeytier,2017-07-08 23:32:00,3990,"That brookie is real big, great trip!"
1008668,4x4bassin,2017-07-11 14:40:00,1025,"Beauty , I have to make it up there one day ."
1008669,jimmer,2017-07-11 14:48:00,2730,I think I am getting a little too excited looking at those pictures. I would love to visit that location!
1008803,cl_fishin,2017-07-13 02:26:00,138,Good stuff......definitely an area I want to check out
