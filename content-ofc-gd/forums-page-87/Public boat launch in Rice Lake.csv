1008895,CRAPPIE,2017-07-14 02:39:00,213,I did google search but both boat launch I think they are belong to Muskie bay resort and Lang's Resort.  We are going fishing very very early in the morning and don't want to disturb people living in the cottage so therefore we want to find a public boat ramp.  Thanks again
1008896,Rwm,2017-07-14 02:46:00,6,Or just type in public boat launches rice lake and see what pops up
1008902,John Bacon,2017-07-14 04:50:00,3277,Do you really need a boat launch for a canoe?  Wouldn't you be able to put your canoe in any where there is public access to the lake?
1008909,CRAPPIE,2017-07-14 11:47:00,213,You are right and I don't really need a boat launch to get onto the lake.  Can you tell me any place I can park near that two marinas?
1008955,EC1,2017-07-14 20:13:00,930,lol. too lazy to search but not too lazy to go fish. http://www.osmtownship.ca/en/things-to-do/Boat-Launches.aspx
1008966,porkpie,2017-07-14 22:08:00,2521,"Wow the circle dots really came out to play in this thread.  Where where you guys in the last boat launch thread?  OP, I'd help you if I could but I have only ever fished Rice from Bewdly."
1008976,John Bacon,2017-07-14 23:49:00,3277,You are right and I don't really need a boat launch to get onto the lake. Can you tell me any place I can park near that two marinas?  I am not really familiar with the area.  A Google Earth or Google Maps + Satelite search may reveal likely spots.  Public access points may not show up on a Google search; but actual boat launches probably will.

1009039,CRAPPIE,2017-07-15 14:57:00,213,"Sorry guys,  I will post my report once I find out where I can launch. Thanks again for the advise!"
