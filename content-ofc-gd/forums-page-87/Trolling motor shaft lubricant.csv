1008844,G.mech,2017-07-13 18:08:00,830,I just give mine a go with a scrubbing pad and some boat wax from time to time and it seems fine.  My first boat had a trolling motor that had been in storage for 3 years or so and it was seized solid so you couldn't even deploy it.  Once I got it moved I cleaned and waxed it and never had another issue.
