1008988,manitoubass2,2017-07-15 01:46:00,11391,"The anglers handled it very well  The fact the guy had what im assuming is his kid talk crap is embarrassing  ""What if that was a human baby""?  Seriously????  My gawd"
1008989,J Roelofsen,2017-07-15 02:16:00,84,"The dude USED a youngster that would have had an indifferent opinion to intentionally harass a law abiding angler. Comparing fish to a human child!? Really? I definitely would have felt very provoked, confrontational and ready to lay into the PETAphile behind the camera.  Science my ass.....where do these people get off hurling this Bull? You want to eat plants, cool.....I like a good salad just as much as a big hunk of meat I cut off an animal I selectively and humanely  harvested like my ancestors have done for millenia. My body naturally thrives on a mix of red meat, fish/chicken, vegetables and fruits. Don't f#$k with my health because your too much of a pansy to kill for food. You wanna eat veggies only, cool, just don't push your views on the rest of us.  Imagine this, move a few of these Aholes to the artic and see if they can convince our northern indigenous peoples to cut the meat from their diet  Teach them to farm veggies on the tundra and ice floes! Lol! Those vegans would rather see you starved to death than harvest your food responsibly like our ancestors have for tens of thousands of years  This shouldn't even be news! Sometimes I wonder how delicious those fearless, free range, vegetable grazing loudmouths would be on the BBQ.....  Josh"
1008990,J Roelofsen,2017-07-15 02:23:00,84,Obviously you guys aren't the ones to preach too! Lol! It's a topic that gets me very worked up...  Josh

(1) A person shall not interfere with lawful hunting, trapping or fishing by,  a) tampering with traps, nets, bait, firearms or any other thing used for hunting, trapping or fishing;  placing himself or herself in a position, for the purpose of interfering, that hinders or prevents hunting, trapping or fishing; or  c) engaging in an activity, for the purpose of interfering, that disturbs or is likely to disturb wildlife or fish.   Unfortunately, I am not sure if a verbal assault would qualify under the law. Just ignore them and I take out the hearing aids, don't engage them and they'll move on for a more cooperative target."

1008913,FloatnFly,2017-07-14 12:13:00,1640,This is absolutely ridiculous.  I really hope the fisherman call the game wardens with the license plate and show them this video. What a complete bunch of morons.  https://www.facebook.com/10NewsWTSP/videos/1646682155365530/?hc_ref=ARRb9aI9PvdFcj4ZqO3qqyZqMNiz8fP4zg9jG2tPAAds0u-DedAiT6CqGRXcHdvG5yE
1008919,Dutch01,2017-07-14 12:50:00,1431,"I would have clubbed the fish so it wouldn't matter if they throw it back.  I'd also download the video if this happened here and contact OPP/MNR.

1008922,jimmer,2017-07-14 13:23:00,2730,I couldn't even finish watching that. People are nuts and that guy was harassing them. Those guys showed a lot of restraint.

The only thing that would have saved that self righteous penis from my full wrath was the fact that there were kids present. Had they not been there, my response to him would have been banned from bookface. HH"
1008926,bow slayer,2017-07-14 14:09:00,1074,I was hoping one of them was going to throw him over the railing...........so sick  and tired of people trying to impose their agenda on others.
1008928,bobowski,2017-07-14 14:19:00,360,wow. Those people are nuts. The fisherman should have slit the gills right in front of him.
1008929,Tom S,2017-07-14 14:19:00,362,"It makes me sick that people are so misguided that they can't tell the difference between a person and an animal.  Reminds me of that person who was bringing stray dogs from India to Canada for adoption. Thousands of dollars and man hours put into their effort, but totally missed the mark. How many destitute children with empty bellies and no access to medical care did they walk past to get to the dogs? I applaud their passion for a cause, but all that effort and money could go to a much better use.  Edit - and that fisherman should have bonked that fish and not let it lie on the pavement like that. If you're keeping the fish just kill it or livewell/stringer it, make it a humane harvest."
1008930,jimmer,2017-07-14 15:03:00,2730,Some animals get treated better than many children in our society.
1008931,Acountdeleted,2017-07-14 15:14:00,2562,"Wow. I watched the whole thing and felt my blood boiling. The guy throws the fish back into the water (he guy harassing the fishermen). One guy calls the cops. I hope the guy stuck around and was charged for what he did.  I honestly can't believe the nerve of some people.  The police statement:  When the officer arrived, the protesters were already getting in their cars. The primary concern for the officer was to restore the peace and the officer didnt witness any disorderly conduct or criminal activity. The officer documented the call as well as the names, addresses, and auto tag numbers of the principal protesters. Whether one agrees with the message or not, any group has a right to free speech in a public park. The officer acted appropriately under the circumstances.  So these people are going to keep doing this because they got away with it. Feel sorry for the guys who were fishing. They'll probably never go back there."
1008936,DanD,2017-07-14 15:38:00,2223,I wonder how the protester would of answered this question? Why do animals (including fish) eat other animals???  Dan.

Nothing worse than a Zealot no matter what the subject from religious to being a veterinarian, errr I mean vegetarian. I don't think I would have handled it as well. I only wish someone tries the same to me here at home, I wish. Where's a Cop when you need one? Especially a Cop that hunts and fishes. Here buddy read this on the way to being charged for interference and being a Goof. That poor kid, imagine being the son of that idiot.  Went back to try and listen to the entire thing, still couldn't finish. He must belong to same religious sect as my brother in law. His science tells him the earth is 3000 years old and the entire Adam and Eve story debunks the big bang nonsense. There is no way to reason with people of the same ilk. I tried for 23 years. For the last 2 years I just politely say hello and try and find somewhere else to sit or better yet don't go."

1008962,Rizzo,2017-07-14 21:45:00,4754,that was crazy. Vegans come across as total idiots. Fisherman shows unbelievable restraint. Disgusting that they bring children into this.

I'd never leave a fish to bounce around on the asphalt in front of kids I don't know. A lot of fisherman are just as crazed and belligerent as P3TA  folk.
