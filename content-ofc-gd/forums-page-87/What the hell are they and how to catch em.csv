1008624,RAO,2017-07-11 00:44:00,13,We have a cottage on six mile lake and this past weekend I was playing around with a down rigger in some open water.  I kept marking fish in the 40 - 70 foot range.  I am thinking they are walleyes but am not sure.  Anyone have any ideas on what they are and how to catch em.  I do have a down rigger so getting to that depth is not a problem.  Also I don't think they are lakers as I have not heard of anyone catching lakers on SML.  RAO
1008625,BillM,2017-07-11 00:46:00,17367,Six Mile Lake just north of GPool?  Doubt they'd be walleyes at that depth with the water temps they way they are.  Drop a jig down and see what happens.
1008631,John Bacon,2017-07-11 01:58:00,3277,Ciscoes maybe.  Hard to guess without knowing what fish are in the lake.  Seems pretty deep for walleye.
1008648,sauce,2017-07-11 04:03:00,219,I bet a worm under a slip float set at 40 ft would get a fish sooner or later.
1008649,RAO,2017-07-11 09:58:00,13,what about trolling the worm harness with that work
1008650,bigugli,2017-07-11 11:23:00,6138,"You might be surprised at what you might find. I spent a fair chunk of my younger years on 6 Mile. My cousin was probably the last person to catch a laker  there back in 72. Weighed in just over 10lbs. There are lots of other fish you might find that deep. Ling, smallies, and yes, walleye"
1008694,RAO,2017-07-11 19:25:00,13,so any suggestions on how to catch what's down there
1008695,chris.brock,2017-07-11 19:28:00,4053,"Fish On-Line isn't always accurate, but they list Whitefish, Cisco and Rainbow Smelt in SML.  Ciscos are usually in a school. Smelt are solitary but pretty small. I'm guessing you're marking whitefish.  edit- I'd jig a small spoon or small grub on top of them and see what happens."
