1008332,manitoubass2,2017-07-06 16:16:00,11391,Wow!  That was some storm eh?  6 trees down in our yard  Im not sure I've ever seen that much lightening
1008337,Cast-Away,2017-07-06 17:05:00,790,Very cool shot! I did not know you could do time lapsed photos with a GoPro in video mode.
1008339,Reef Runner,2017-07-06 17:35:00,980,Amazing shot! Thanks for sharing.
1008358,leaf4,2017-07-06 22:28:00,2466,Sweet! That's a lot of bolts going on there wow
1008360,misfish,2017-07-06 23:01:00,29133,Very cool shot! I did not know you could do time lapsed photos with a GoPro in video mode.   I found out you can take a video with 2sec pic at the same time. I was wondering why I had 436 downloads from my session 5. LOL  I did get some great fish jumping action shots.  I really dont want that to happen again though.   Great shot Simon.

That was some storm eh?  6 trees down in our yard  Im not sure I've ever seen that much lightening  We had no wind here with the storm, the other week though I lost 2 of our 150' spruce....firewood for next year. The sunset afterwards was stunning, but I was being eaten alive just getting those shots, the skeeters have finally arrived....and I swear I could hear them saying....""fee-fi-fo-fum.....we smell the blood of an Englishman""    Very cool shot! I did not know you could do time lapsed photos with a GoPro in video mode.  depending on which version of Gopro you have there is a feature called 'time-lapse video', however I did not use that I just let the camera run at 1080p @60fps, the hero 5 I have does a decent job of auto setting for darker environments. If I had the time, could have got a lot sharper image using the regular photo time-lapse setting but with only being able to have intervals no shorter than 1 sec I'm not sure I would have captured the shot.  Amazing shot! Thanks for sharing.  Thanks.   Sweet! That's a lot of bolts going on there wow  Definitely a wild light show the other night, went on for hours!
