I had some concerns that they were smallies! Even a sheephead die off is not good though!"
1008362,misfish,2017-07-06 23:54:00,29133,"Sheep head, other wise known as drum, are the least desirable to eat? LOL POOR MANS LOBSTER  We went through this with the carp on Simcoe. Those are the least desirable to eat. LOL POOR MAN WONT EAT IT."

1008381,Sterling,2017-07-07 13:15:00,477,Happens every year. There are usually thousands washed up on the north shore.  Paging Old Ironmaker
1008383,Old Ironmaker,2017-07-07 13:22:00,8243,"Yep, always see a few dead Sheepshead floating around or on shore when it gets hot and stagnant. That's right out front 75"" frontage, do the math. About 13 years ago the water was so low and it was so hot there were dead zones here, low O2 supply and we had all species belly up."
1008391,Fish Farmer,2017-07-07 16:36:00,2234,"I've been on Erie the last couple days, and its Sheephead floating, happens every year.. Sheephead is poor man's shrimp, I know a few guys that eat them. Filet Sheephead, cut filet in strips, one cup of salt in boiling water soup pot, drop strips in, starts to float and turn white, scoop out and put on ice cubes, dip in Shrimp Sauce. You can do the same with Musky, Bass. And there is some people that will eat Tilapia or Basa from Vietnam river sewer. You'd be surprised , what you'd eat buried in Shrimp Sauce, and say it was good."
