1008872,mattp33,2017-07-14 00:51:00,290,Do any of you guys intentionally go out in the rain?  With the way the weather has been reported this summer I'm finding it hard to get out. Almost everyday I have available they are calling for rain.  I have good rain gear but I call myself a fair weather fisher.  Does anyone head out in a boat knowing or thinking it's going to rain?
1008874,Raf,2017-07-14 01:04:00,3495,fish are already wet  knowing it's going to rain has never stopped me.  crazy winds have.
1008875,OhioFisherman,2017-07-14 01:12:00,6623,"I am disabled now and rarely make it out of the house, but for around 30 years I fished bass tournaments and took fishing vacations, dates were planned months or the prior year in advance, I took whatever weather I got.  Even fun fishing, I had some very good days fishing in the rain hoping for dryer weather next time. I would rather have rain than get blown off a lake by wind."
1008878,GBW,2017-07-14 01:19:00,8460,It depends on the rain gear.  Good stuff yeah!  Not so good and you end up soaked to the bone?  Then a short trip.  If I'm stuck due to rain and like stated about the wind I'll head out on my own if the winds are low.  It's all in how you dress.
1008881,grimsbylander,2017-07-14 01:26:00,3016,Fish in the nude...also solves the whole boat distance etiquette issue!  I used to love fishing in the rain on smaller lakes. Not so much on the Great lakes though because of the wind.
1008883,manitoubass2,2017-07-14 01:35:00,11391,"I'll fish in the rain, no issues. Especially for bass"
1008894,Old Ironmaker,2017-07-14 02:37:00,8243,"I had to work in the rain for many years, no matter how hard it was blowing or how cold. Now if I get wet I am bound to get sick, even got pneumonia. I would never fish in the rain even when I was young and fit, no way. Same with golf unless I was in a team format tourney."
1008897,manitoubass2,2017-07-14 03:01:00,11391,Rain isn't the cause of pneumonia  But I hear ya. It's not fun to work/or fish in cold rains all day
1008899,Gallie,2017-07-14 03:19:00,1215,I fish in any weather that doesnt involve lightning and even then i wait until i see the storm coming myself because i have no faith in the weather people lol. Some of my biggest fish have been caught in the rain or just before so it aint gonna stop me!
1008907,Yellow Fever,2017-07-14 11:03:00,139,"Don't seem to have a choice the last couple of years......I have a Simms suit so I don't get wet, However being a Walleye angler I honestly believe that I don't do as well when it rains (medium to heavy) and I wonder if it has something to do with acoustic of the rain hitting the water. So....if it's a hard rain I don't go."
1008908,Governator,2017-07-14 11:18:00,879,"I don't fish hard rain but I find overcast with a light rain on and off is a great day to be fishing, I find the fish are more active and there are less boats on the water."
1008912,fish_fishburn,2017-07-14 12:05:00,1311,"I won't head out in the pouring rain, but if it rains while I am out fishing no biggy."
1008914,Tjames09,2017-07-14 12:22:00,664,"Used the Bimini a lot this year. Seems to rain every weekend. If you only have 2 days to fish and its calling for rain....Ill probably be out in the rain.  If its rain and heavy winds, looks like im watching golf."
1008920,porkpie,2017-07-14 13:20:00,2521,"Rain has never stopped me.  Even right before a storm, the fishing can be fantastic.  My new to me rig has a full stand up top, which is unreal.  I fished in torrential downpours up on Nippissing last week, best thing ever for a troller!"
1008927,Bill Shearer,2017-07-14 14:19:00,456,"I hate fishing in the rain! The last few years I have been taking a week and heading to BC for Steelhead. It rains out there. A lot! Had no choice but to stick it out. On the rainy days I never caught a fish, but before rain hit, or after it stopped? Fishing was good to great! Around the great lakes I don't even bother to go if the rain POP is over 50%."
1008935,Acountdeleted,2017-07-14 15:30:00,2562,NAW and I fished in the rain on the ice once. That was fun.
1008938,Joeytier,2017-07-14 15:54:00,3990,"Those gloomy overcast days with consistent drizzle and a low ceiling generally make for an active bite, strong low pressure and blowing wind/hard rain generally do not."
1008967,mike rousseau,2017-07-14 22:10:00,4661,If I have a choice I'll dodge the rain and plan around it  If it's raining 7 days a week... I'm getting wet lol  That being said with a good suit it's not bad  I'd rather fish in rain than big wind or cold
