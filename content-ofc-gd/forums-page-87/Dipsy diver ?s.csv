1008235,b_cdot,2017-07-05 02:32:00,270,"What's a typical leader length? Using size#1 dipsy divers in erie for steelies, salmon and walleye. I've tried short 4-5 ft and longer 8-12ft. I have limited experience. I am curious if short leaders make fish more reluctant to bite or if there is no difference. Also. Does anyone believe dipsy colours have any effect? Any help would be appreciated. Thanks"
1008237,Rizzo,2017-07-05 03:27:00,4754,Just started last year with dipsey's...I think my leaders are around 8 feet long or so and that works fine.
1008238,porkpie,2017-07-05 07:48:00,2521,"I run a leader of about 5 feet of 40lb mono for salmon, but then I'm adding a flasher and fly or flasher and Twinkie rig that can extend that by 2 to 5 feet.  I don't use snubbers because I use mono.  I've talked to guys that use longer leaders and hand bomb fish into the net.  That seems to me a pain in the butt.  If I where running spoons clean off of dipseys I'd probably stick to a rod length.  If you don't have a long handled extension net, get one.  It's the only way to fly when trolling.  I prefer black or clear dipseys, but some people swear by coloured ones.  I'm sure it works for them!"

1008270,Freshtrax,2017-07-05 19:17:00,2215,I like long leads for kings with flashers. 9 ft or so.  With spoons I run 6-7 ft. If the lead is too short on the flashers I do t get as many strikes.
1008272,John Bacon,2017-07-05 19:43:00,3277,You can consider a slide diver.  Similar to a Dipsey Diver but will slide down the line once it is tripped.  Then you can run as long of a lead as you want.
1008373,Woodsman,2017-07-07 02:52:00,1286,The diver acts as an attractant along with helping get down. 3'-4' works good for me. Too long & netting the fish becomes a problem. Yes colour can make a big difference. Use a lure of a similar colour. Sort of the straggler from the school scenario. In stained water use a mirror type finish. More flash. A few days age in slightly stained water on Erie the only fish(s) I caught came off a gold mirrored colour dipsey with a green monkey puke (copper backed spoon). This far out preformed everything on the boat. In clearer water match your colour to your lure. Tiger fire in clearer water has worked good for me.
