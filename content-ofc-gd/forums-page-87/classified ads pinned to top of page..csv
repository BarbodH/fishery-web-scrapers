Struck me as odd that we can now have our ads pinned when the rules state they can't even be bumped to the top or they'll be removed.  Just curious about this and wondered if the rules have changed or did I just miss something ??"
1009013,Spiel,2017-07-15 10:21:00,9065,"Weird, it ain't pinned now."
1009014,lew,2017-07-15 10:43:00,12766,Well it was definitely there 2 hours ago Chris and that's what made me curious.
1009017,cheaptackle,2017-07-15 12:09:00,849,"Yer still okey dokey Lew - or I'm crazy too.  I looked when I saw your post it was for sure a pinned classified.  Now, it's not only not pinned, it ain't even there!  Like Spiel said - weird!   Michael"
1009018,lew,2017-07-15 12:12:00,12766,Yeah it's funny how it was there this morning and as soon as I mentioned it the ad was gone completely from the page.
1009023,Terry,2017-07-15 12:38:00,14456,still here just way down the page  http://ontariofishingcommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=83150
1009095,Spiel,2017-07-16 11:34:00,9065,"What I meant by ""weird"" was that it was pinned, I unpinned it.It is also now gone. It had more than lapsed the 60 day window for ads."
1009096,lew,2017-07-16 12:08:00,12766,"Still just kinda curious Chris, but does it not take a moderator to pin a post ?"
1009098,Spiel,2017-07-16 13:04:00,9065,"Still just kinda curious Chris, but does it not take a moderator to pin a post ?  Yes, my guess was it was done accidentally."
1009101,lew,2017-07-16 14:00:00,12766,"OK, thanks Chris."
