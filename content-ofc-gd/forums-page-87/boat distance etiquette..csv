There's new boaters out there on this site and not sure how the unwritten rules are out on the water.  Basically rookies give plenty of space to other boaters when fishing and don't be looking for other peoples spots.

I was clearly drifting down a shoreline making casts when this guy and his wife pull up in there boat just 50ft away from me down drift and drop anchor and they start fishing . Now I know I don't own the lake but some common sense should come into play here , total idiot move on a large lake with very few fisherman . Now the guy in your case Simon is the definition of an idiot and a total Bull move especially when you have your son in the boat having a good time catching fish . Rant over"

That night we head over to the spot, to find an elderly couple fishing where the marker was; as in the marker is not there anymore. No big deal as we start to make a wide berth around them; thinking we go back later. The next thing we see is them waving us over? We pull up beside them and it turns out they were locales and had seen us put the marker out earlier that day. They said they have been fishing that spot for years and didn't want the marker there, for everyone to see. They gave the marker back and told us to tie off to their boat, as it was firmly anchored. Well me had a great time with them and we all easily limited out; before the sun went down. Most nights for the rest of that trip we'd meet up with them at that hole; we called happy hour.  Dan."

I don't mind too much if the person encroaching starts up some banter, had some fun times meeting with people who saunter over, don't do it myself but thats just me.  One time last year a guy from the US came over to my boat and we started the banter, ended up  parking our boats on shore and trekking into a cache lake to cast for bass, great adventure and still in contact with them. I'll talk to anybody, so when you approach my boat within conversation range at least have the courtesy to say good morning. Had a guy 2 days before the incident in the picture come about the same distance to me with the bimini up and his back to me....just ignorant.  I rarely confront people as if they are showing all the signs of ignorance it rarely ends well, I resent moving, but half the time these people are useless fishermen, so I slam a few more, making it plain to see, exaggerating the hook sets etc....watch their frustration increase, then move on.  Maybe they should introduce a rule in the regs like the slot size, e.g.. Zone 5...keep a minumum distance of 100yrds from boats not in your group. There could even be Zone Exceptions....eg ""Zone 4, Lac Seul from Manitoba point to Burntwood Bay.....minimum distance 3 miles"".....lol"

Most of the cat fishermen i know on sight either by their boat or their equiptment on board. They will usually ask over the radio or holler to see if you have caught anything. We then say yes set up over there or no go to buoy 54 spot. The rare person who set up to close will be asked if they please not interfere on our spread and shown how far out we have our spread.

Sorry pal I would love to help but I have to go chase down my freeking board and by the way you owe me a few hundred yards of line, the line on your prop you can keep is what I would have said most likely (Italian hothead some days.)  Happened to a buddy a few years ago. Steve being Steve did go back once he found the board and helped him (actually law in Canada to aid a disabled boater). The guy did apologize and it was just a mistake. He had just started trolling out here and didn't have a clue what he was doing. Offered Steve 50 bucks. Says a lot about the man and Steve and how I can just loose it before thinking and getting the facts.  Just thinking, it is actually a law for Canadians to be nice."

I still enjoy fishing the Kawartha dam circus in the fall for something to do, and nostalgia. Lots of funny stories. Last year my Dad was down on a pier and a guy was fan casting over his head. Also last year I was fishing vertical and a guy's float from 50' away was in front of me when I snapped (also with my Dad).  Fishing and being outdoors is better when people say Hi and chat and hangout together without crap like this."
