(good to be the handy guy sometimes) We trade a friend work for use of their cottage 2 years running now. Anyway Ive never had my but handed to me like that lake did last year! It was horrible, nobody was catching anything. Something Id like to avoid this year. So Im looking for advice from the pros on here. any advice will help Im sure. Thanks Sheldon"
865585,Cosmos,2014-07-30 15:25:00,588,I spent half a day last Thursday fishing Balsam. Was trying for pike for couple hours with no luck. Went to do some bass fishing around island after. Fishing was pretty good. My father was cranking and I was throwing wacky worm. I ended up with 2 big basses and lost one huge one close to the boat. My dad got himself a nice smallie as well. Also we got a couple of dinks each. We spent 6 hours in total and got decent 5 fish in the boat.

I would still work weed lines- trolling jerks or blades, cast weed lines etc- Should connect with Pike- although the bigger ones will be down deeper. Musky are still there as well of course- but Balsam is not the lake it once was for them...."

Targeted muskie with zero success, switched to SMB around Hogg Island (careful of the rocks) which proved to be successful but found the most action while pitching lures near & under docks in quite bays early in the morning for LMB."
865979,esoxansteel,2014-08-01 17:56:00,1307,"Will be there starting Aug 10th for 5 days, targeting anything that wants to suck back 6 to 14 inch streamers on 10 to 12 wts, with a mix of conventional musky gear as well, and some deep weedline walleyes"
