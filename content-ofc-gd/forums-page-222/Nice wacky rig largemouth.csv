866113,fishindevil,2014-08-03 00:31:00,6254,Well I hit a lake in the Bancroft area I have always wanted to fish and did pretty well for both largies & smallies and have now concentrated on largies as I have got my nickel smallie so it's time to try for a nickel largie !!! Wacky rigged senkos & spinnerbaits as well as dropshot all took fish as well as the huge smallie I lost after he did a 3 foot high cartwheel in mid air throwing my spinnerbait back at me at light speed !!!!! Anyways here is a very respectable largie that was pic worthy !!! Not quite a nickel but close !!!! The hunt continues !!!

866131,misfish,2014-08-03 08:59:00,29133,Very nice fish there. If you can get on Weslecoom (sp?) You might just find that nickle.
