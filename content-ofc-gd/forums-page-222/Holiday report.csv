We have been to the island 7 of the last 9 summers and it gets better every time.A little bad weather to start it off but it was still awesome just being there. Fishing was pretty good and my wife Sherri and I managed to get out for a few evening fishing excursions and even caught some fish. The lakers were slow to start but warmed up pretty good. I had a goodie hooked and fought it for about 20 min with it taking long runs the entire time, and I never got it up past 50 fow before it spit the hook. That happened twice lol   , sure would have liked to have seen those fish.  Here's a nice little laker that made it to the table!    Sherri with a pike with marking that I have never seen before, Cool!    We hooked up on some very nice smallies as well!    "

Deep, cold, clear and holds a lot of fish. Some beautiful places along the shoreline as well. And a big PPark has a good section left in a natural state. We've gone for a weeks summer holiday 15 of the last 17 years. My kids have it ingrained in them lol. The sunsets are awesome  "
