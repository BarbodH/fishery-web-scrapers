866504,msp,2014-08-05 21:36:00,1336,"thanks for the kind words guys I gave him my senko rod to use as that was the only spinning rod that I brought with me. I was throwing the jig all weekend. Needless to say that the bass really wanted the senko. He has really learned patience and he will listen to me when I say "" check your line, if you feel anything set the hook "" He got his PB all by himself about 4 lbs."
