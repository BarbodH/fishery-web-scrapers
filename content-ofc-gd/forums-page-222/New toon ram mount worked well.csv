Turns 360 and can remove for under water pics.  .    The rod holders. Not really happy with it. Problem is,when I use the oars,there,s no real place to put them other then where they are. They  effect my casting to the left of the toon. What I have now will do. Im sure one day out fishing,It will come to me.     Taking the whole finder bag out on the toon is a P3TA. So I came up with what worked great. Swivels 180 deg to get rid of sun glare. Battery sits nice out of the way, in the side pouch.    .  Was out in jigging grounds this morning with it. Another great sunrise. Awesome calm waters in the bay here this morning.    Had a few hits but nothing hooked up.  Played with perch and tried for some smallies. (not the best place to catch smallies on the bay) More of a jigging ground spot.  By noon, the long weekend boat warriors  were out,and it was time to head in.  Ya I know,I dont own the lake like they do.  I was thinking about how to put a small cooler for fish or my lunch on the toon. There is enough space behind me to put a plywood platform and secure it to the pontoons. The cooler could sit on the plank.  Ya I know Terry,electric motor. LOL  Think I covered just as much water as you did today. Although,I did see you rowing a bit today. Good on ya. Till the next day  Happy fishing."

866085,Terry,2014-08-02 19:04:00,14456,"it was a nice morning on the toons, the one boat coming at me sure scared the crap out of me, might be time to add blinking lights and a air horn or a gun..lol"
866087,misfish,2014-08-02 19:27:00,29133,"Good to see you enjoying the new toys Brian.  Thanks Lew,  Like I said before,Im having a great time..  I even had a few lookers today saying that my toon was a pretty cool set up. Ya I say. No fuss no muss. Fits in the back of my car. In no way am I one of those GO GREEN  guys. it,s just something I have found and really like to fish out of.    Your not the only one with a DRONE."
