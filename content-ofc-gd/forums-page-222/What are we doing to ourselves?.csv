Sauntered down to the river to check out the fishing possibilities, near where a woman was standing with two children. Noticed a wild raspberry bush, so I plucked off a couple of juicy ones and popped them in my mouth.She: (with furrowed brow): ""What are you eating?""Me: ""Wild raspberries!""She: (furrowed brow and frightened sneer): ""What?""Me: ""Wild raspberries."" Plucked another off and showed it to her.Child: (with a slight look of wonder) ""Mom, can I have some?""She: (with confused shaking of head) ""No, no, I don't want you eating wild stuff."" (leads them away from obviously crazy person)Now, there are good reasons to teach your children not to eat whatever they find in the wild, some can be poisonous. But she couldn't even recognise a wild raspberry, and not even when I showed one to her. How the hell do people become that detached from nature?"

Whose mother was here in town acting at the festival. He had only ever been in Toronto until then.  So my Dad decides we should teach him to fish, and we made plans to head out one night about 6PM to a spot where you could always catch something and quickly. As we are driving out to the ole fishing hole about 10 miles out of town. The lad jumps up off the seat and into the back of the stationwagon and goes LOOK AT THOSE.... THOSE WHATEVER they are!!!!!!. Those would be dairy cows.  So Dad decided we should turn around and take him around him over to the farm where my Uncle was working part time as a dairy hand. Talk about having someone have their head explode, when we showed him the milking process that evening...  He was a smart kid just never had ever been exposed to ANYTHING RURAL.  Every time I saw him years later on the sit com he wound up working on, or in a couple movies he has been in lately. I always get a chuckle about how his lack of country knowledge cost us a fishing trip... LOL."

Wild leeks, mushrooms, wild rice, fiddleheads, apples, a huge range of berries, making pickels, jams and jellies, jerky, mint, maple syrup, birch vinager, and all the fish and game we could want; the list is almost endless.
