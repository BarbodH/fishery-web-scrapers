865811,captain2002,2014-07-31 20:19:00,5,"This is a shot in the dark, I love to fish but with arthritis and carpal tunnel, tying on lures is almost impossible. Took me 10 minutes to put a top water on my line, at least 12-15 tries before I did it. Other than a snap swivel I'm at a loss, and even have problems opening the snap. And the lures do not react as they should when using them.  I have done Google searched for help, but  no real answers.  Suggestions any one???  Thank you."
865818,Lape0019,2014-07-31 20:37:00,647,A shot in the dark but would you be able to use a fishing knot tool?
865824,Fisherpete,2014-07-31 21:03:00,1814,"Berkley makes a product called Easy Clips - I used to use them all the time with good success. You will have to tie it on once, but after that changing lures is a breeze. I landed many big pike and muskies with no issues on them.  Here's a link:  http://www.berkley-fishing.com/Berkley%C2%AE-Easy-Clip-Snaps/Swivels/1285567,default,pd.html  Pete"
865825,davey buoy,2014-07-31 21:07:00,5505,"As far as snaps,and tying directly?,I could argue that.I have seen no difference in catching fish quantity or size using either method. I personally prefer a snap swivel ,but that won't help you now. I'm sure you will get some great options!"

865834,bare foot wader,2014-07-31 21:42:00,1354,"can you still work with hemostats, or needle nose pliers? I sometimes tie a clinch knot with hemostats when my fingers are really frozen, perhaps it would work easy enough for you too  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW-WH5Ai44E"
865850,misfish,2014-07-31 22:43:00,29133,I have fought with that knot. Even with one bad finger. Thats the cats meow right there. Thank you.BFW. Right on.
865852,Musky or Specks,2014-07-31 22:50:00,2710,I use a uni-knot/Duncan's you can tie it as large as you need too and then just tighten it. Like literally a foot wide to start and performance of the knot is still the best there is. Threading the eye will still be an issue however.
865868,Ralph Field,2014-07-31 23:46:00,1018,"Try this , it may help. Run your line through the eye of the lure, then form a loop above the lure leaving a long tag end, next hold the tag end below the lure while still pinching the loop above the lure, next spin the lure around the tag end 6 or 7 times, next run the tag end through the loop formed above the lure , pull tight, moisten the knot and snug it down to the eye of the lure. Much easier then it sounds."

I like those Berkley Easy Snaps too, great for cold fingers!"
865953,captain2002,2014-08-01 13:56:00,5,"Thanks guys for all the ideas, I will check them all out and let you know what's best for me. I knew I came to the right forum."

866079,Hank Jr,2014-08-02 18:52:00,146,Hhere is the stringease I use it for Muskies it comes in different sizes for Bass to Walleyes makes changing lures quick and easy . I been using them the last several years on Cowgirls and Bulldogs never had one fail or break
866083,Hank Jr,2014-08-02 18:57:00,146,Sorry I thought I pasted a picture of the Stringease multi use clip but it didn't work . You can buy them at several online shops . Do a search and look them over it will help your problem no opening snaps just a quick twist . I have most of my Muskie buddies using them now so far everyone likes them
866086,misfish,2014-08-02 19:05:00,29133,Is this it Hank? Many to choose from.  
866149,captain2002,2014-08-03 14:32:00,5,"Thanks again one and all some great tips, looks like online shopping is now on my to do list.  Gerritt I tried Celebrex along with every other know prescription for pain and inflammation. I have 2 total knee replacements, having a hip replaced this winter and Dec 2015 a total shoulder replacement. Can you say ""Bionic man"" As you can see I have an issue with Cartilage, or the lack of it. Contact sports and osteoarthritis equals me......"
