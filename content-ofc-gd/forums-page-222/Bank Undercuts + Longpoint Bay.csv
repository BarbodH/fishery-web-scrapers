865934,The Urban Fisherman,2014-08-01 11:35:00,2050,Hey guys!I have to film some underwater footage of bank undercuts... Preferably under cat tails... I know where there's a ton of them on the bay of Quinte that go several feel under the cat tails. That said if I can avoid having to drive 4 hours to film underwater footage for an hour that'd be awesome lol I'd rather walk 5 minutes down to my dad's boat on the bay!Feel free to PM me if you'd prefer... there's some free baits in it for anyone who can point me in the right direction!Thanks!Ryan
865943,Steve,2014-08-01 12:54:00,2075,take the drive.  demorestville creek.  still clear enough for good footage.
866060,lookinforwalleye,2014-08-02 13:52:00,4399,Ryan I used to love fishing undercut banks on Scugog not sure if the bog is conducive to good underwater footage...let me know if you need more info!
866070,Sinker,2014-08-02 15:44:00,8692,I was going to suggest the kawarthas as well.  S.

866199,mike rousseau,2014-08-03 19:31:00,4661,Where are you located...  Edit... I'm girding near long point bay.... Lol
866203,Christopheraaron,2014-08-03 19:44:00,3525,If rivers are an option (no cattails) most silt bottom rivers have undercuts.
866271,The Urban Fisherman,2014-08-04 13:50:00,2050,"Hey guys!  Sorry I'm just getting back to this today it's been a super busy weekend.  Yeah I live on Longpoint Bay - The Kawartha's for the most part are just as far as driving to Belleville for me so I'd be better off just going to a spot I'm familiar with.  I'm just hoping to find something local if at all possible.  I might take the Jon boat out one afternoon this week and just run the cat-tail banks to see if I can find something.  Chris - Great Idea man - I was thinking the same thing... it's just been pounding rain every night for the past week so I have to wait for the creek to clear up... I can get up the lower stretches of big creek pretty far with the Jon boat to.  Have a good one guys and thanks for the ideas!  Cheers, Ryan"
