866227,mattp33,2014-08-03 23:09:00,290,Lmao. That's funny!!!!  I think about bringing my Bose speaker in the boat but I am always so focused. Maybe I should make fishing a little more fun!!!  Also I think my girlfriend bailed on me for tomorrow morning so it looks like I am solo again tomorrow.  I will stay clear of any rocking out toons on the lake.
