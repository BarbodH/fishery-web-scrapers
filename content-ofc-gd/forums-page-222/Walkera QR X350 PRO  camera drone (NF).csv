866308,Terry,2014-08-04 18:08:00,14456,privacy yeah I was climbing a tree to retrieve it..lol  and someone asked me just what the hell I was doing/ looking at....
865619,Terry,2014-07-30 19:00:00,14456,"I  bought a Walkera QR X350 PRO  camera drone thought it would be great for getting high shots   and a great toy I was not happy when the instructions said..not for Amateurs...crap I never flew a r/c plane or anything else so.....expect crashes this is the transmitter it has a monitor in it to view the onboard camera   this is my first flight there was some windy and kids showed up as soon as it got air borne  I was really concerned cause I have never landed either  the on board camera did not record for some reason ,, will work on it here is the first flight   "
865632,Fisherman,2014-07-30 19:57:00,7201,"I imagine it's not for the faint of heart to fly those.  I used to fly model airplanes, had a couple of crashes, rule of thumb, always have at least 2-3  x the recovery height when things go wrong.  Now with a chopper that's probably a bit different."
865634,misfish,2014-07-30 20:04:00,29133,"I love it. A new skeet shooting object.. LOL   Cool buddy. When do I get to crash ,I mean try it.LOL"
865639,Snowball,2014-07-30 20:13:00,167,"Excellent flight for a first time pilot. Congratulations. Video from one of these craft is awsesome. Check this out:  http://youtu.be/iDiLdp-uQO4?list=FLfgRW7tx6LHRQmOx5r-ppZQ  That was NOT my video.  Regards, Snowball"
865646,Terry,2014-07-30 20:39:00,14456,I thought it would be easier  I can see I will need to practice all the time to get good and buy spare parts cause crashing will be in my future...lol
865651,aplumma,2014-07-30 20:54:00,6896,Drone flying is easier than helicopters but a crash is still expensive. I have a couple of hundred hours on mine and while I am comfortable flying it to get smooth video that is coherent will take time and practice. one of the best practices is to set out 2 cones and do figure 8's once that is comfortable try doing it and keeping the camera centered on the cones.  Good luck and good flying.   Art
865654,Terry,2014-07-30 21:00:00,14456,thanks for the advice  I  do see me  making lots of time to practice I want to be good enough by winter  to do icefishing videos nothing like having aerial support
865656,Rodbender,2014-07-30 21:13:00,1027,Thought that model had the home button lands itself??
865658,Terry,2014-07-30 21:22:00,14456,"it does  but I have not tested it, one step at a time, I  am not sure I calibrated the gps and whatnot.. they fly away if you don't have everything right plus kids came around where I took off from so I could not do the one button home switch"
865660,aplumma,2014-07-30 21:25:00,6896,Terry here is the unit I fly  http://www.dji.com/product/phantom  it has lights that help you see the direction and attitude it is flying easily. Check your settings to see if it has a setting for GPS lock  and landing mode. The GPS lock will allow your unit to hover in the same place and altitude when you take your hands off the controls. The signal loss is when the unit will return to the original power up point and land. Here is a tip from your uncle Arttie do not energize it in the garage and then carry it outside and test this function. Cost 1 leg strut. 4 prop's lesson learned priceless.   Art
865663,Terry,2014-07-30 21:35:00,14456,"yup it has all that, I was flying it today in hover mode but the wind was moving it around pretty good  mine has the green at the back, red at the front lights too and it sure helps to keep you going in the right direction  I looked at that Quadcopter too, went with this one"
865675,Fisherman,2014-07-30 23:13:00,7201,You guys are giving me the itch to get back into flying.  Where did you buy that Terry?
865689,Terry,2014-07-31 00:24:00,14456,ebay
865690,Fisherman,2014-07-31 00:28:00,7201,"Ah, okay, hadn't seen any like that at Ideal hobby."
865694,Terry,2014-07-31 00:59:00,14456,http://www.canadadrones.com/    http://stores.ebay.ca/Dyno-Hobby?_trksid=p2047675.l2563     they  have a store in ottawa
865854,Terry,2014-07-31 23:06:00,14456,a couple more videos 2nd flight and 3rd flight         
865869,Fisherman,2014-07-31 23:50:00,7201,Nice flight..'cept for that little spruce shaving at the 2:20 mark..
865873,Terry,2014-07-31 23:57:00,14456,"yeah I thought I lost her for sure, got to remember when it's pointed at me forward is backward, well not really it's all in my mind control  will come in time"
865875,Pikeslayer,2014-08-01 00:13:00,1443,Can you get us a live update on the Skyway situation in the Hammer??
865876,Fisherman,2014-08-01 00:15:00,7201,"Ya, it's one of those things, left, right, up and down.  I used to ""fly over my shoulder"" when it was coming towards me.  And when you're up side down, push, don't pull especially when you're only 10 feet from burning worms.   Spectacular crash to say the least."
865884,Terry,2014-08-01 00:35:00,14456,"right  flying away from me while looking at it easy everything else takes concentration, and when you panic your fubared"
865997,misfish,2014-08-01 19:19:00,29133,I see a use for this on the Notty.
866001,Terry,2014-08-01 19:35:00,14456,I was going to bring it tomorrow and give you air support  lol from a toon..lol
866003,misfish,2014-08-01 19:38:00,29133,That would be cool.
866306,blaque,2014-08-04 18:05:00,2419,"My buddy has the dji model.......hes an ace at flying it now but the blades still have grass/leaf stains on them from his first few flights lol  most people come around and watch ........but we've also been asked to ""shut it down"" on more than a few camping trips already as a select few are complaining about invasion of privacy."
