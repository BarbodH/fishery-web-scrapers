Good move thinks I.  http://www.thestar.com/sports/leafs/2014/07/22/maple_leafs_shake_up_front_office_hire_stats_guru_kyle_dubas_28_as_assistant_gm.html   VIEW 5 PHOTOS JAMES EGAN PHOTOGRAPHY / SPECIAL TO THE STAR Kyle Dubas has been named assistant GM of the Maple Leafs. The Maple Leafs nearly completely transposed their front office by firing assistant general managers Claude Loiselle and Dave Poulin and hiring Kyle Dubas, dubbed by many as the Billy Beane of hockey. The hiring of Dubas, the 28-year-old GM of the OHL Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds, is tantamount to a turnaround in the direction of the team to one that favours the advanced-stat approach that is gaining traction in the sport. “Kyle is a young executive that has made a strong name for himself in hockey with a progressive style, work ethic and maturation beyond his years,” said Toronto Maple Leafs president Brendan Shanahan said in a press release. “He has a fresh approach that we feel will benefit our club for years to come.” Beane’s stats-based approach to baseball management helped keep the under-funded Oakland Athletics in playoff contention and turned into the movie Moneyball.  FROM THE ARCHIVES: Q and A with Kyle Dubas  Dubas, a native of Sault Ste. Marie was a hockey operations assistant at the age of 14 with the Greyhounds, and then later worked as a scout for the club while enrolled at Brock University’s Sports Management Program. His grandfather, Walter, served as head coach of the Greyhounds from 1960-1967. Upon graduation, Dubas became the youngest player agent certified by the NHL Players’ Association with Uptown Sports Management. “The chance to work for the Toronto Maple Leafs is like a dream come true,” said Dubas in the release. “I’m truly excited to begin helping this team win and learn from men like Brendan Shanahan and Dave Nonis. I’m very thankful for this opportunity, but equally grateful to the Greyhounds organization and the city of Sault Ste. Marie for helping put me in this position. The Leafs are focused on building a team that will enjoy long-term success and I am excited to play a role in it.” Dubas took the Greyhounds, a hockey organization that finished out of the playoffs in his first season, to finishing first in the OHL’s West Division last season with a 44-17-2-5 record. “We’re excited about the addition of an up-and-coming hockey executive in Kyle,” said GM Dave Nonis. “He is an innovative thinker that will bring enthusiasm and impressive abilities to our club. His work ethic, character and demonstrated leadership in Sault Ste. Marie make for a valuable combination that will certainly have a positive impact on our organization in many ways.” "

861123,Oggie,2014-07-01 14:37:00,588,I agree with Bill M. We really don't need another slow defensemen that supposedly is a team leader.  Surely we've learned our lesson. Didn't we bring in Tim Gleason for the same reason. How did that work out?

861165,leaf4,2014-07-01 17:27:00,2466,"I really don't know what komarov will change, he's asking a lot of money because he can make it in the KHL but he's only worth so much, when he went back they'd offered him 1.7mill/yr and he made high 2's maybe into 3 I can't remember exactly.  I mean I like the guy but it was for selfish reasons d(albeit personal ones on being able to be on display for his country for sochi) he left but he's not worth what he's asking in a salary cap worl"
861166,Steve,2014-07-01 17:31:00,2075,"which is what he is worth.  $2.5m to $3m a year in the current nhl.  if you can tie him into a contract for multi years, he'll be even cheaper once the cap is increased."
861168,grimsbylander,2014-07-01 17:33:00,3016,"I wouldn't want to pay Bolland 5.5 a year to be a 3rd line center..  No way.   Sign Komarov today, that's all I want Toronto to do.  I agree with Komarov...but not the ""that's all"" part lol"
861171,leaf4,2014-07-01 17:44:00,2466,maybe the process of trying to  call Russia is holding them up from calling players that can actually add something to the roster other than grit? Matt frattin is good but we traded him once already and retained salary with scrivens to acquire bernier
861172,Jds63,2014-07-01 17:45:00,1365,Bolland - questionable future due to injury Raymond - play making ability but not much grit Clarkson - complete waste of money  the fact that they are gone is definitely not going to keep them from making the playoffs lets see what they pick up ... just heard Matt Frattin from CBJ
861173,leaf4,2014-07-01 17:48:00,2466,Stephane robidas in on a 3 year deal for the leafs... I wonder the price
861175,grimsbylander,2014-07-01 17:54:00,3016,Frattin is back. Interesting
861178,leaf4,2014-07-01 18:02:00,2466,yikes 3mill a year for a 37 year old robidas?
861179,Oggie,2014-07-01 18:04:00,588,I think Clarkson could be a good player for the Leafs if the team ever buys into the style of play Carlyle wants. I just don't think the coach has the type of players he needs to play the style he's coaching.  If you give Clarkson some other players on his line who like to cycle I think he'd be pretty hard to play against.  He was in New Jersey.  I liked Frattin and I think he'll be a matured player more willing to pay the price now.
861183,Oggie,2014-07-01 18:06:00,588,When I hear the name Robidas I think of a soft whinny player with a great ability to score but no defensive side.  I haven't seen him play enough but is my memory failing me?
859439,BillM,2014-06-19 18:33:00,17367,Depends on what you're going to get for him.
859741,kickingfrog,2014-06-21 12:30:00,8333,"Brad Richards bought out by Rangers. Remember all the hype around him signing a few years ago when he was a free agent? Brian Burke was ripped because he couldn't, or wouldn't, sign him."

Brian Burke was ripped because he couldn't, or wouldn't, sign him. How smart Was NY for giving him that insane contract before the new CBA, they knew full well there was going to be a buyout option down the road if need be. Now who signs him for 2 mill? Its all about where he wants to go now."
859754,kickingfrog,2014-06-21 15:47:00,8333,It is also about who wants him now.

860680,lookinforwalleye,2014-06-28 12:52:00,4399,But he has nice hair!!!

I was hoping for something from the OHL or the WHL to add some sandpaper to this team.  I agree Shanahan can't enter next season with the same lineup that imploded last season. I know he's preaching patience but he also needs to send some kind of message to the players.  Same coach, same GM, same rooster ............ isn't the definition of insanity doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result??? Dan O."

860963,Oggie,2014-06-30 19:30:00,588,That's good to hear. I did know about Gunarrson but Gleason I wasn't aware.  Franson is a one trick pony. I remember when he held out at the start of last year only to come back and score an impressive goal on the powerplay off of a one timer.  Well that was the SHOW for the year apparently.  He struggled shortly after that and for the rest of the year.

However there is a problem if your watching the cup finals and a team has won in 4. Ranger are supposed in theory to represent the best in the east
857520,grimsbylander,2014-06-10 19:29:00,3016,"The fact the west is dominating this series 3-0 is not too surprising. I don't think many people had trouble predicting a cup win in the west. March 19 I posted ""west = cup"". Pretty easy call to make."

They can take solace in knowing that they are playing a very mediocre hockey team and that, despite the hype, the goalie hasn't won squat and is in the 3rd round for the 2nd time ever."
854427,davey buoy,2014-05-20 19:13:00,5505,"I think that hit on Price,for all arguments sake hit them hard ,he  was there for them when they needed it.I hope they can pull some type of miracle together,they have the team to do it.If for nothing else do it for Price.He deserves that much!!."
854428,kickingfrog,2014-05-20 19:37:00,8333,Few teams in this nhl could do well without their top goalie.
854466,grimsbylander,2014-05-20 23:32:00,3016,The way Henrik is playing Montreal can't blame losses on not having Price. It's the Lundqvist show.  I think the tune is...  ♫♪ na na na naaa♪ ♫ ♪♫ na na na naaa ♪♫ ♫♪ hey hey hey ♪♫ ♪♫ bye bye ♫♪
854533,bman32,2014-05-21 13:18:00,27,"The West will still steamroll the winner of the east regardless. If a strong talented team starts pouring shots on Lundqvist, hes going to give up goals. Just look at Team Canada vs Sweden."
854535,BillM,2014-05-21 13:26:00,17367,"The West is going to be tough this year, I dunno if Montreal or NY has what it takes to beat them."
854801,leaf4,2014-05-23 02:45:00,2466,NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO   now  YEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS   I wonder what overtime will bring!
854807,lookinforwalleye,2014-05-23 03:18:00,4399,Another lousy goal....but I will take it!!!!
854809,kickingfrog,2014-05-23 03:21:00,8333,And no one will talk about the puck hitting his glove.
854812,lookinforwalleye,2014-05-23 03:30:00,4399,""" the real art of conversation is to not only say the right thing in the right place, but also leave unsaid  the wrong thing at the tempting moment"""
854830,BillM,2014-05-23 11:37:00,17367,I think every goal lastnight was a fluke!  Nice to get Montreal get some life back into their game.
854854,grimsbylander,2014-05-23 13:44:00,3016,Those pesky Habs!! Good on them for not giving up.
854892,davey buoy,2014-05-23 19:03:00,5505,Yes
854900,misfish,2014-05-23 19:45:00,29133,Totally impressed with the back up to the back up. Solid performance I thought.  Lots of goon plays by both teams. And you all bashed the Bruins. PFFFT
854903,BillM,2014-05-23 19:59:00,17367,"Carcillo gone for 10 games, Prust I'm guessing will get 2-3"
854979,jbailey,2014-05-24 10:35:00,866,"Carcillo gone for 10 games, Prust I'm guessing will get 2-3 2 games for prust, i HATE this scheduling, habs play tomorrow night?!"
854980,BillM,2014-05-24 11:23:00,17367,"2 games for prust, i HATE this scheduling, habs play tomorrow night?!  Yeah tomorrow...  , this scheduling is silly.  It doesn't make any sense."
854987,lookinforwalleye,2014-05-24 14:16:00,4399,NHL pandering too the US networks is my guess!!!
854991,kickingfrog,2014-05-24 15:12:00,8333,"Noth  NHL pandering too the US networks is my guess!!!  Nothing new there. The US hockey fans, all 7 of them, carry more weight then the ones in Canada. It's really the tv netowrks though, and the relative peanuts that nbc pays the league speaks more loudly then the billions that the Canadian networks pay. Why do you think we had two afternoon games on our long weekend?   That triple overtime Memorial Cup elimination game last night/this morning was great. Hope the Oil Kings have something left so the Final is a good game. Guelph is a solid team and they're playing real well."
855085,bushart,2014-05-25 14:41:00,2628,I'm thinking the scheduling goes as follows........with no team (not even the Leafs) guaranteed of playoff runs----these buildings are booked long in advance  You would'nt leave them vacant on the chance of a hockey game---likely the case for delayed times
855101,misfish,2014-05-25 16:41:00,29133,"  My monies on Guelph. Like you said,solid team."
855105,kickingfrog,2014-05-25 17:06:00,8333,Ya the rink in Montreal was booked for last Saturday night so the habs played at home at 12:30 instead.
855136,davey buoy,2014-05-25 20:33:00,5505,Just watching the start of the Edmonton/Guelph game.Bobby Orr is aging well.Almost like he would like to do a lap or two!!Good for him!

855145,davey buoy,2014-05-25 22:13:00,5505,Has the making of a rough MTL/New york game.Sure looking forward to this one!.Let's hope MTL shows them who's boss!lol.
854219,davey buoy,2014-05-19 15:29:00,5505,"Breaking news,Carey Price out for the remainder of eastern conference. Sorry Bill just noticed you posted this.Your to quick lol."
854225,lookinforwalleye,2014-05-19 16:06:00,4399,"Price out for the remainder of the series!  This is bad news for Montreal.  Well it was a nice run while it lasted, Kreider did his job!!!"
854232,davey buoy,2014-05-19 17:03:00,5505," Well it was a nice run while it lasted, Kreider did his job!!! I hate to think it was intensional?,He didn't leave much real estate to try and miss him though."
854240,BillM,2014-05-19 17:31:00,17367,"I don't know if he ran the goalie on purpose, but uh... he didn't try very hard to get out of the way...   This wasn't the first time he's got in contact with a goalie this playoffs either."
854249,lookinforwalleye,2014-05-19 18:29:00,4399,All I know if we are going with Budaj we don't have a chance in hell...unless o f course the blueshirts collapse!!!
854251,misfish,2014-05-19 18:32:00,29133,I guess the Bruins had a bit of class. .
854261,kickingfrog,2014-05-19 20:32:00,8333,All I know if we are going with Budaj we don't have a chance in hell...unless o f course the blueshirts collapse!!! The rangers are awful enough for that to happen.
854277,glen,2014-05-19 22:36:00,2641,I guess hockey is over then.   See in the fall.
854282,dhickey,2014-05-19 22:51:00,1038,What's going on here ??? I've been away for 5 days fishing and I come home Price is out?? What happened?  I guess that only leaves Chicago.  And yes no cells or tv..
854292,leaf4,2014-05-19 23:26:00,2466,"As I was hoping, it looks like it'll be a NY/Chicago final, if the series play out how they look like they will.  Though I do feel bad for price to get hurt during such an epic year for him personally. but without him this team would not be where they are and without him moving forward I think they will be out in 5 or maybe even less. pulling for Chicago to win but it would be nice to see St. Louis trade pay off for him"
854295,irishfield,2014-05-19 23:33:00,26272,"Gee Don.. I thought you were still in bed.. Boston lost, but I see you've moved on ! lol   Price... NY figured their only hope in winning was to take him out..."
854297,glen,2014-05-19 23:43:00,2641,I don't like that hit on price.  Going with the back up to the back up.   Interesting.
854301,dhickey,2014-05-20 00:09:00,1038,Well I guess we will find out if they have the skill and talent to get to the final.  Glen if that was a dig at me .  I have been a Chicago fan as well as a Boston fan for 40yrs. I haven't seen the hit on Price but I'm sure I will see a replay during the game.   Don.
854302,BillM,2014-05-20 00:10:00,17367,Surprised not to see Budjah in net.
854304,glen,2014-05-20 00:20:00,2641,No dig saltydawg.  Yes goal.   Go Habs.
854305,leaf4,2014-05-20 00:22:00,2466,well that was a quick answer to that first tally lol
854306,glen,2014-05-20 00:24:00,2641,Maybe their only chance is to crush the king.
854309,kickingfrog,2014-05-20 00:32:00,8333,"The HNIC crew mentioned that the habs had the most goalie interference penalties this season with 13. Gallieger had as many alone (8), has the team with the second most."

854314,dhickey,2014-05-20 01:01:00,1038,Looks like Cherry had a little to much booza sitting on the dock..
854328,BillM,2014-05-20 02:11:00,17367,I dunno how Montreal is going to come back from a 0-2 deficit going into NY..
854339,dhickey,2014-05-20 03:03:00,1038,They cant......
854358,jbailey,2014-05-20 11:38:00,866,stranger things have happened
854367,lookinforwalleye,2014-05-20 12:51:00,4399,I dunno how Montreal is going to come back from a 0-2 deficit going into NY.. A step in the right direction would be scoring more than one goal....at the end of the day really does not matter who the Habs have in net if they only manage 1 goal a game!!!
854377,BillM,2014-05-20 13:38:00,17367,They should take out Henrik to even things up. (I kid I kid)
853868,lookinforwalleye,2014-05-15 20:07:00,4399,Ya those Bruins are classy guys....he will get his one of these days!!!

854060,lhousesoccer,2014-05-17 17:23:00,442,"So I've been having this discussion with friends.  Who do you pull for after ""your"" team has been knocked out of the playoffs, assuming you don't have a back-up/alternate favourite team?  Let's say you're a Boston fan.  Do you now cheer for the Rangers, because you want to see Montreal knocked out?  For me, I actually pull for the team that knocks out my team, which pretty much every friend of mine thinks is weird.  Here's my reasoning: I'd rather see the team that knocked out ""my"" team go all the way and win the Cup, so you can say ""well, we lost out to the ultimate Stanley Cup Champions"", rather than seeing the team that knocked out my team turn around and get knocked out themselves in the next round.  So, for instance, last year, even though I'm a Leafs fan, I was pulling for Boston to go all the way.  And I really don't like Boston AT ALL.  I'm also a Montreal fan (blame a split family allegiance for this - my father's side of the family are all die-hard Leafs fans, and my mother's side of the family are all die-hard Habs fan, so I grew up loving both teams).  So this year, I'm pulling for the Habs all the way.  BUT after this last round, most of my friends who were Boston fans are now pulling for the Rangers, which to me is weird.  They want to see the Rangers destroy the Canadiens.  Revenge, I suppose.  Just curious how others view these things."
854061,BillM,2014-05-17 17:34:00,17367,"Being as classless as Boston is, you'll never find me cheering for them, ever.  I'd cheer for Ottawa before them (I know, I can't believe I just said that).   For me it's the next Canadian team in line."
854063,kickingfrog,2014-05-17 17:51:00,8333,"Entertainment, skill and talent. Chicago is the only team left worth watching.  Hard to believe as a Noris division refugee I'd ever have anything nice to say about Chicago."
854069,misfish,2014-05-17 19:19:00,29133,"Looks like the Canadians,forgot there was another series to play,and their showing their cheap shot side now.LOL"
854070,davey buoy,2014-05-17 19:21:00,5505,Looking like a write off for MTL today.Too many penalties and Lundquest was on his game early.
854071,Tom McCutcheon,2014-05-17 19:29:00,627,Just under 10 minutes to play and look at all the empty seats.....  Fickle Habs Fans.

853790,darsky,2014-05-15 03:01:00,586,Well Spiel. I am guessing IF there was an NHL team from Hamilton that made the playoffs and just beat the best team in the league and made it to the final 4 of hockey you MIGHT be pretty excited about it. I am just guessing tho'. I could care less about your rod builds but I won't announce it. Oops guess I just did.

853498,lookinforwalleye,2014-05-13 15:54:00,4399,"No surprise here...it starts from their coach who is the biggest whiner in the league.  Thornton and his bush league moves of this year, Chara and his classless laughing and the incident with patches after he embarrassed him, Marchand and his constant jabbing and poking, Lucic who in my opinion is a disgrace. I lost what little respect I may have had for him after the incident with Dominic Moore, if I recall correctly Moore was involved in a bit of of a pushing match with an equally small Bruin and Lucic blindsided Moore with a punch to the head. Sure wished Lucic would have maned up and accepted Laraques invitation.   All of the above is an opinion of a guy who has been a Habs fan for over 50 years and has seen a lot of Bruin crap in those 50 years!!!  I think the Habs have a pretty good chance tomorrow night and nothing would be sweeter than beating this collection of neanderthals in their own barn."
853504,glen,2014-05-13 16:31:00,2641,Right on lookinforwalleye.  Sure wished Lucic would have maned up and accepted Laraques invitation.
853511,BillM,2014-05-13 17:53:00,17367,Lucic fight a tough guy?  hahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
853516,lookinforwalleye,2014-05-13 18:24:00,4399,yes wishful thinking!
853519,kickingfrog,2014-05-13 18:35:00,8333,Lucic fight a tough guy?  hahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha   yes wishful thinking!  The teddy bear clowns now tick me off as much as the guy running around starting fights and then finding the first linesmen.
853521,davey buoy,2014-05-13 18:43:00,5505,"I can't wait for the time Lucic gets himself into altercation with someone of size.Hopefully he will stand up like he should and deal with the outcome.Likely will never happen?,run bully run!!!!!!!! lol."
853522,jbailey,2014-05-13 18:54:00,866,NYR or Pitt?!  I hope NYR takes it
853524,davey buoy,2014-05-13 18:59:00,5505,"I'm thinking Pitts,but looking like Rangers have some momentum.Should be a great either way.If a MTL/Ranger series..Rangers are a lesser version of Boston,so that play will work in MTL's favour.Wishfull thinking I know lol."
853541,misfish,2014-05-13 19:55:00,29133,"Canadians played a great game. Kudos to them. Boston still getting chances,but not capitalizing. Been a great series.    Don  I think you talk out of yer hat, more then me. That puck was NOT in.LMAO  I think who ever wins this series will be there for the cup.  Go BRUINS  Go RANGERS."
853644,jbailey,2014-05-14 12:13:00,866,Who would have thought Rangers would be in the conference finals?!  Woooo original six conference final!
853681,kickingfrog,2014-05-14 16:36:00,8333,The same people who said the 2-3 spot in the metro was easiest route to the conference final?
853704,jbailey,2014-05-14 18:33:00,866,The same people who said the 2-3 spot in the metro was easiest route to the conference final? and who are they?
853707,davey buoy,2014-05-14 18:44:00,5505,Should be a great game.Pitts and Rangers did not have the same intensity of the Bruins Habs .I will say let the team that wants it more tonight good luck heading forward.Great series so far.
853730,kickingfrog,2014-05-14 20:52:00,8333,and who are they? Who indeed.
853737,bushart,2014-05-14 21:40:00,2628,"Apparently the fear of the ""JINX"" is at play here for game 7  No sign or predictions from the loyal fans---nobody wants to eat that Word sandwich tomorrow I reckon"

853765,Roy,2014-05-15 00:50:00,13728,I do believe.....it'll be an UGLY 3rd.
853277,jbailey,2014-05-12 12:23:00,866,"Who are you going to replace him with though?  Everyone can bag on Dion all they want, but his stats don't lie. Did you just answer a question with a question? lol"
853278,leaf4,2014-05-12 12:25:00,2466,"this is true, dion is a top tier defenseman but they just put so much on his shoulders he comes under scrutiny for everything he does.  ""Looking at the bigger picture, however, this past season the Maple Leafs were outscored by 16 goals at five-on-five; but outscored their opponents by four goals (56 goals for, 52 goals against) with Phaneuf on the ice. In addition to leading the Maple Leafs in ice-time by a wide margin and facing some of the toughest matchups of any individual player in the league, Phaneuf also managed to score eight goals and contribute 31 points in 80 games. In short, Phaneuf remains a credible top-of-the-lineup defenseman. """
853279,BillM,2014-05-12 12:33:00,17367,Did you just answer a question with a question? lol  It appears I did!
853294,DRIFTER_016,2014-05-12 14:34:00,10439," It appears I did!  The correct response would have been ""What do you mean?"""
853299,glen,2014-05-12 14:55:00,2641,His replacement will be worse. Who is responseable for getting the most out of the players?   Is that person doing a good job? I say no.
853300,BillM,2014-05-12 15:00:00,17367,There seems to be a definite disconnect between the players and the system they're being asked to play.
853305,grimsbylander,2014-05-12 15:46:00,3016,"At what point is motivation the responsibility of the individual players and not the coach? What motivating Toews, St. Louis, Getslaf or Parise this year? I guess they'd all be average guys without the coach there to maximize their efforts and talents. Not likely. I believe their success stems from pride and work effort. So easy to blame the coach but there is no way he's the stand alone problem. You can drop in any Jack Adams winner and he'll struggle with some of those cry baby, spoiled, under achieving brats that try like hell when they're in the mood and cruise around when they're not. Does Carlyle need to go? Maybe, but as soon as you have a system where guys can sign long term, big money contracts whereas the boss gets fired when they under-perform you'll have a very skewed sense of reality. The motivation should be pride and the word millions behind your salary. But hey, they're not in the real world."
853321,glen,2014-05-12 17:01:00,2641,Wanting to win and putting in the effort is on the players. Putting the players in the best position to succeed is on the coach/managers.  Look at everyone and you will get your answers.
853334,kickingfrog,2014-05-12 19:28:00,8333,Would the possible market for Dion have been better without the new deal?  Maybe Burke will take him back in Calgary?

853336,jimmer,2014-05-12 19:39:00,2730,If Phaneuf stays they have to keep his ice time down to 20 minutes a game. He plays better with reduced minutes. Crazy they sign him to long term contract and now they want to dump him. Sometimes I think the media makes this crap up just so they can talk about the Ontario teams.
853346,BillM,2014-05-12 20:37:00,17367,"If Phaneuf stays they have to keep his ice time down to 20 minutes a game. He plays better with reduced minutes.

853245,irishfield,2014-05-12 02:25:00,26272,Sorry Don.. he's playing above most players abilities!

What gives that franchise the rite to use Canadian in there team name? I cant think of any other team that has the arrogance to incorporate  their Country into a franchise name? I would like to see them go back to their original name Montreal Maroons.  In no way does the Montreal franchise have the rite.  The only team that has the rite to call themselves Canadian is .  TEAM CANADA.......  Don. Ps. GO BOSTON GO........  Do the Vancouver Canucks count?  Also Montreal Maroons were a completely different franchise.  Both teams were in the league for quite a few years.  Generally the anglophones cheered for the Maroons while the francophones cheered for the Canadiens.

A simple bounce in OT of game 4 and it's a whole new series. All in all a very entertaining one and congrats to Boston. The better team won the series. Gonna be hard to stop them when they get Rollin'. They'll def stomp on the Habs.  On a different note...Pittsburg is in some poop I think. This CBJ team is giving them much more than they bargained for.  Great hockey is being played in all series so far. Can't wait to see how it turns out.

849146,bushart,2014-04-21 15:15:00,2628,Yup and Stamkos was onside  And the knee to the head of Stamkos looked very much like this season when Neal kneed Marchand in the head and it cost him several games---no call  I guess nobody said it had to be fair----just marketable
849148,BillM,2014-04-21 15:17:00,17367,I don't think the knee was intentional at all.. Stamkos was absolutely onside.   This is what happens when the calls don't go your way!
849149,bushart,2014-04-21 15:26:00,2628,Like I mentioned---not a Tampa fan by any stretch---be nice to see a level field though  Like the game after the Sens/Habs fiasco---one ref from that nite reffed the very next night in Ottawa  He must have had the guilts cuz Ottawa was getting Power plays for next to nothing---2 minutes for passing gas??
849170,lookinforwalleye,2014-04-21 17:35:00,4399,Yup and Stamkos was onside  And the knee to the head of Stamkos looked very much like this season when Neal kneed Marchand in the head and it cost him several games---no call  I guess nobody said it had to be fair----just marketable So your saying Emelin was trying to knee Stamkos in the head...from what I recollect Stamkos was on all fours sliding and Emelin tried to jump out of the way!!! And forget this level playing field Bull...Montreal has been the better team without question!!!
849174,bushart,2014-04-21 18:27:00,2628,yup he was sliding cuz Prust knocked him down------again no call  Yes Montreal has played better in this series--no question  ref'n last nite in Montreal was one sided---not sure what game you were watchin??

849182,kickingfrog,2014-04-21 19:24:00,8333,It's lazy logic to suggest that Canadians have to support the team in Montreal to be patriotic.  The Tampa coach is a funny guy who does keep things in perspective and had lots to say about the game despite being limited in what he can say without being fined by the league.  I think at the start of the play-offs CBC did a little get-to-know the coach thing on Copper. The best part was him breaking down game tape of the outdoor oldtimers game in Detroit where Steve Thomas (a Tampa assistant coach) was not back checking at all.

849079,bushart,2014-04-21 01:01:00,2628,I wonder if they could ever get impartial refs when playing in Montreal---makes a joke of the league  And I could care less about Tampa Bay
849080,Joeytier,2014-04-21 01:09:00,3990,"Give me a break!  Guys at the intermission illustrated the relevant rule quite well and the ref did have reason to make the call.  Still extremely questionable?  Absolutely, but to say the refs are impartial is a little silly IMO.  Hope Stamkos is okay"
849082,bushart,2014-04-21 01:13:00,2628,Well the game where Ottawa was leading by 3 goals with 4 minutes left---had their goalie run right over and no call---everyone seen it---but hey it's Montreal  Price and an imaginary skate sharpening right when they had an icing and no wind---yeah right---total fairness
849085,Joeytier,2014-04-21 01:18:00,3990,"Yeah, because those things don't happen to every other team in the league on a regular basis...jeez.  Ask any other veteran goalie in the league and they'll all say they've done the same thing a million times"

849090,jedimaster,2014-04-21 01:41:00,3472,Well I don't really feel anything for either team but the reffing sure looks tipped to one side to me. Good pace to the game though.
848738,Stoty,2014-04-19 02:07:00,2910,That Lucic spear was brutal. I love him as a player and would def have him on my team but that crap is uncalled for. Marchand is still the biggest goof in the league though. Haha
848741,kickingfrog,2014-04-19 02:11:00,8333,What makes it more frustrating for me is that Lucic is a big guy and wants to be thought of as tough. Tough guys don't do that. Little guys with big mouths do that type of thing.
848754,BillM,2014-04-19 02:47:00,17367,Lucic never fights any other 'tough guys' always second stringers.. Nice to see Detroit pull that one out!
848755,kickingfrog,2014-04-19 02:53:00,8333,Interesting stat (that means squat).  The last 2 times the habs were up 2-0 going home they lost the series and the team that beat them won the cup.  Cains in 2006 and Boston in 2011.
848758,BillM,2014-04-19 03:00:00,17367,"Going back to Montreal 2 up is great, I don't care what the stats say, lol."

848796,lookinforwalleye,2014-04-19 12:14:00,4399,Being up 2-0 is certainly no guarantee of success as the anti-hab   so eloquently points out  but having said that I like the way the Habs are playing seems like everybody is pretty much on the same page and all four lines are going....props to Rene Bourque for turning his game around he was good in game one but last night he was outstanding.
848799,kickingfrog,2014-04-19 12:19:00,8333,... And playing against a marginal back-up goalie.
848802,lookinforwalleye,2014-04-19 12:30:00,4399,Yes thanks for pointing out the obvious... we know Bishop is not playing...tough...but from what I have seen so far Montreal is obviously the better team and Tampa`s defense can not handle the team speed Montreal is throwing at them!!!
848805,lookinforwalleye,2014-04-19 12:35:00,4399,And Lucic has proven many times over that he is a classless punk...he will get his one of these days!!!

I know it's playoffs and I'm comparing apples to oranges but I just can't remember the last time I saw a Leaf finish a check!  Refreshing to see body contact.  It's easy to complain you're not getting the bounces, the breaks aren't going yoiu're way, etc. But there's no excuse for not getting on the body the way the Leafs did all year. It's hard work and they just had no work ethic. When Stamkos has an off night he starts finishing his checks and driving the net .... not breaking sticks like Phil Kessle."
848608,davey buoy,2014-04-18 16:04:00,5505,Last nights Ranger and Philly had some good ole hitting going on. Leafs lost there passion somehow. Be interesting to see what happens during the off season.

Chicago had the fewest with 16.8.  I guess, if you have the puck more you can't hit people.  http://www.sportingcharts.com/nhl/stats/team-hit-statistics/2013/"
848621,SirCranksalot,2014-04-18 17:11:00,3291,"This guy says to the bartender, ""Can my dog and I watch the Toronto Maple Leafs hockey game here? My cable is out, and my dog and I always watch the game together.""The bartender replies, ""Normally, dogs wouldn't be allowed in my bar, but it's not very busy right now, so you and the dog can have a seat at the end of the bar. But, if there's any trouble with you or the dog, I'll have to ask you to leave.""The guy agrees, and he and his dog start watching the game. Pretty soon, the Leafs manage to score a goal and the excited dog jumps up on the bar, barks loudly, does a back flip and runs over to the bartender and gives him a high-five.The bartender says, ""Wow, that's pretty cool! What does he do when they win a game ?""The guys answers, ""No Idea, I've only had him for 3 years."""

847081,kickingfrog,2014-04-10 21:21:00,8333,"Yes and no for me. I like watching the older games 60's through the 80's for nostalgia but the quality of players, from 1st line to 4th, is higher now. The water ski era mid/late 90's through early 00's was, and is, painful to watch.  Kids in junior hockey have puck skills that even the best nhl players from a short while ago just marvel at. Remember when most NHL teams had one big shooter? Now most junior players shoot like only a handful of pros could only 20-30 years ago. (Yes, the sticks play a role but there is more to it as well).  I also miss the days when goalies had to make saves. Now it's: move into position, drop to knees, shrug shoulders, repeat.  Off to the Colt's game..."

847115,kickingfrog,2014-04-10 23:28:00,8333,"Best line so far. Good, Shany can take Clarkson's spot."
847126,tb4me,2014-04-11 00:28:00,3295,Welcome to Toronto Shanny! Lets hope he can work some magic! Im no GM but I have a feeling there is a shake up in the works..The man has connections!

847209,Headhunter,2014-04-11 16:00:00,5703,The long and winding road to Leaf respectability has bodies littered all over its sides... I remain skeptical that this will change with this announcement. HH
846998,BillM,2014-04-10 17:48:00,17367,"I don't agree with any of your post, lol!!  But that's ok here are my reasons to keep a few of those guys..  Ranger?  He's just getting back on his feet after a 4 year layoff and was getting better each game.  Gleason?  You want to get rid of the only muscle on the D line?  Gunnarson? He's probably the best D man Toronto has..  Kuli?  Sure.... I wish he'd gain 50lbs, then he'd be dangerous.. Also Kadri, first full season in the NHL and he scores 20 goals.... Let's not make another stupid trade, you keep him.  As far as Bolland is concerned, only if they get him cheap,... Clarkson? Trade him for a pack of Smarties and we'd be on the winning end...   100% agreed on Komorov, they could have used him this year...  Also no way Kessel gets the C, he's not a leader..."
847000,jedimaster,2014-04-10 17:53:00,3472,"Toronto needs a Captain that canboth play well enough to silence the media, speak in the media and be a leader in the dressing room. If not Phaneuf who would be a better captain? I don't really see one. Pretty much has to be a top pair D man or a first line player. Bozak? JVR? Kessle? No I don't see any of those guys. Perhaps they can make some trades this summer. They still could use a top 2 defenseman or at least a tough stay at home grinder that can play with phaneuf ad well as the obvious of course is the top line center that they need so badly."

And Gunnerson? Hmmm not sure, being the best D man in Toronto is like being the one-eyed guy in the land of the blind. The Clarkson/Smarties comment was hilarious though. Maybe if Shanahan comes to town they can be the dynamic duo from Mimico!!"
847003,leaf4,2014-04-10 17:57:00,2466,"gleason is getting paid way too much for what he brings, I like his game, but not at 4mill a season, maybe 2. I wouldn't want them to trade Kadri but if the right deal comes up then maybe,  I also like Kulemin but he is also making too much for what he brings, he cashed in on a single year 30 goals and he's making 3 mill a season and will probably want a raise now that he will be a UFA.  I like Mcclement, but only on the penalty kill and d zone starts, he's basically useless past the red line.  Gunnarsonn doesn't bring enough to the table to warrant being a 1st line pairing so maybe if he wasn't getting 3.5mill a year and they could find a true #1 to play with phaneuf then he could stay."
847004,kickingfrog,2014-04-10 18:01:00,8333,Tim Leiweke sure talks a lot.

Agreed, I don't see any of the guys they have right now as 'leaders'....   They definitely need to acquire someone...   And beefing up the D line is a must this year."
847008,jedimaster,2014-04-10 18:16:00,3472,"The top line woul dbe great with an upgrade but yah the defense needs to be upgraded. That is a must have.  A Bozak upgrade would be a nice to have, and figuring out what to do with the goalie situation. Noone wants a canucks problem. hahaha  I am not really a cap guy but I do know that they are up against the wall. That means trades, salary dumps or some of the UFA's don't get resigned if they want to get better. Honestly I truly believe the leafs are two players away from being a much better team. if they can get an upgrade down the middle on the top line either in terms of skill or grit and an upgrade for Phaneuf they will have a much better run next year. Clearly one of the goalies is going and its pretty much written on the wall that Reimer goes.  The leafs have alot of UFA's this year. Bolland, Kulemin, Mcclemant, Raymond, Bodie, Ashton(RFA), Franson(RFA), Ranger, Gardiner(RFA), Reimer(RFA), Macintyre(UFA)  I think Armstrong and Tucker come off the book, freeing up 2 mil but I am not too sure how that works out. So with riemers 1.8 plus the 2 mil, maybe a mclemant gives them 6 mil to play with. of course they need to resign a few people, but gardiner resigns for a song and a dance given reily is in the pipe, Kulemin, bolland, ranger I would re-sign. I dunno. Lots of work to be done."
847011,Headhunter,2014-04-10 18:23:00,5703,"IMHO, there is a fairly short list of players who I would consider keepers on the current roster; -Bernier -The two kids on defense -Kadri -JVR The rest came be replaced fairly easily... yah, I know it's hard to replace Kessel's offensive output, but his defensive liabilities add up too fast not to consider him available for the right price. The rest of the defensive core is mediocre at best and frankly, getting worse by the game.  I expect that the Leafs are going to have a heck of a time getting any free agents to sign here and will in all likelihood, be left picking up whatever leftovers are available after ""good teams"" have their pick.  Ask yourself this question... would you sign with the Sad Sap Leafs? Forty odd years of futility with no end in sight? Upper management in complete disarray. They'll get the dregs, the ones who have no other choice offered to them and this futility will only grow. Yah I know, pretty optimistic eh... that’s what forty odd years of being a fan and watching these guys will do to yah! HH  PS... does anyone know if the collective agreement allows for any buy-outs this off season... I got a few ideas on that front as well."

What most of Leafs Nation don't get is that it's not the team that's annoying, it's the Fairweather fan base they have. After winning 2 games at the start of the year they're gonna win the cup and everyone else sucks. But when they lose it's the refs fault or bad goaltending or whatnot. Great winners, horrible losers. And as you can see by how many replies this thread has....a lot of chirping goes on, most of it being from Leaf fans. I'm all about a great hockey debate but some people are just unreal."

If you think it's just Leaf fans who are disgruntled with their team, get on the Ottawa web site forum. Or better yet, look back at the bashing going on in DETROIT when they were hovering near the bottom of the heap. 6 Games into Detroit's playoff run the bashing will begin and around here it'll be ""Stoty who""??

The decision is wrong many different ways. But the team loosing thinks they are getting a break because having a full game to make up a 1 goal deficit is better then 50 odd minutes. The team up by 1, who should have a bigger beef with the decision, thinks that being up by 1 is better then starting all over at 0-0. And the decision was made in New York and they think they crap gold. that's absolutely ridiculous.. "

846847,Squid,2014-04-10 02:49:00,1656," Rob's right, Price has yet to show his abilities in the playoffs. Halak and a million blocked shots by Gill really helped them beat Pitt and Wash a few years ago, and last season Price wasn't exactly stellar, but I would put that weight on the entire team, they stunk against Ottawa.  Anyway, lets just hope this is his year! He's incredible to watch when hes on his game!  Also, why the hell did they start the Columbus @ Dallas game at 1 - 0 and play a full 60 minutes? (It was the postponed game when Peverley collasped) Why not just reset the score, or continue the game from the previous place?! I am assuming this has more to do with viewers/fans than anything?  I f you know anything about the habs then you would know that Price was injured during the Ottawa series. He was wrapped up pretty good but was just not good enough. Halak was and never will be a starting goalie. He is unable to play 65 to 75 games a year and that is why he has been shppoed around this year."

Getting mason Raymond back at a decent price 2-2.5/year would be a good signing too, and to get komarov back would be great, but probably a pipe dream  I also think and I know a lot of guys won't agree with it but make Kessel captain at least assistant, he carries this team on his back every night and takes the blame even though it's not his to take he rarely makes big blunders and is the person this organization is going to be looking at for most of the offense for the next 8 years and maybe more, he's still young now 25/26 even into his thirties if his scoring dips, he is an accomplished playmaker as well, to go with that he's shown many times through his tenure in toronto as a non selfish player such as ovechkin, huge plus in my books.  http://m.theglobeandmail.com/sports/hockey/leafs-beat/phil-kessel-takes-ownership-of-leafs-collapse/article17893101/?service=mobile"

That's not hate, just facts.  ...a Olympic and junior gold don't mean a thing in the NHL!!!  Rob's right, Price has yet to show his abilities in the playoffs. Halak and a million blocked shots by Gill really helped them beat Pitt and Wash a few years ago, and last season Price wasn't exactly stellar, but I would put that weight on the entire team, they stunk against Ottawa.  Anyway, lets just hope this is his year! He's incredible to watch when hes on his game!  Also, why the hell did they start the Columbus @ Dallas game at 1 - 0 and play a full 60 minutes? (It was the postponed game when Peverley collasped) Why not just reset the score, or continue the game from the previous place?! I am assuming this has more to do with viewers/fans than anything?"

Even better. If Dallas doesn't score, the game winning goal will be scored at 0:00 of the first period by a guy that did not play in the game.  The decision is wrong many different ways. But the team loosing thinks they are getting a break because having a full game to make up a 1 goal deficit is better then 50 odd minutes. The team up by 1, who should have a bigger beef with the decision, thinks that being up by 1 is better then starting all over at 0-0. And the decision was made in New York and they think they crap gold."

No wonder every win at any time of the season is cause for celebration yet every year another team in the league wins the coveted cup.  Leaf fans have the market cornered when it comes to excuses as to why their team continually fails to succeed. Difficult to feel sorry for them. Guess they deserve the team they have."

846503,Stoty,2014-04-08 19:15:00,2910,"Torts is NOT suited for that team. Very bad move sigining him to 5 years (i think)?? Torts is coaching a bunch of tarts. Apples and oranges, IMO."

Until the one dimensional players (no matter  what their personal stats are) play both ways the Laffs will be forever mired in the Toronto curse regardless of all the yelling and cheering from their misguided fans.  So Toronto, the rest of the league has figured it out.  The Laffs are ALWAYS short handed in their own end when your 'skill' players are on the ice.  The Laffs 'skill' players only do their job between the blue line when they are racing to the opposition's net. They eve score once in a while and then coast back when the other team is pounding the Laffs goal tenders.  When the Laffs defense is left to carry the majority of the load while the skill players skate around in circles waiting for the puck for a break out, it is no wonder they look bad. DEFENSE IS A WHOLE TEAM EFFORT not just the job of the defense men. The Canadian Men's Olympic Hockey team made that painfully obvious and yet early in their campaign most of the Laff fans on this board criticized players like Crosby for lack of goal production and applauded Kessel (he's on fire) for  his individual stats.  Bottom line, team defense wins. Laff fans should look at teams way ahead of the Laffs with a lot less scoring punch but with a total team commitment to defense. Not very exciting hockey but at the NHL level they win a lot of games and they can smother  and frustrate opposing 'skill' players.

I think he will excel with another team but after Bern got here he changed, lost his confidence, and the coach didn't do him any favours either throwing him under the bus the way he did. Clearly Carlyle has to go. He runs this team on how he likes his players, not how valuable to the team they are. Kadri, whom is under Carlyes most hated list, played the second least minutes in the game and yet scored the game winner. The kid has talent, but RC hates him. If RC had Gretzky, Lemieux and Crosby as his first line, and he didnt like them personally, theyd ride the pines. He totally ruined Reimer. Hes an idiot and the sooner hes gone the better. Theres a lot of young talent on the Leafs. They are a few years away from being a contender. They need someone to bring the talent that they have to where it should be."

845709,Stoty,2014-04-05 11:37:00,2910,"Toronto's (main) issue is defense. Clearly letting 40+ shots on a regular basis is unacceptable. Even if the goalies stand on their heads and save 90% of the shots they face, they're still gonna give up 3, 4, 5 goals. Can't win like that.  I agree that Carlyle needs to go but I don't think coaching is their biggest issue."

D has collapsed, now all these crappy chances are now good chances.  Scoring chances is the stat people should be looking at."
845727,Stoty,2014-04-05 12:33:00,2910,Sure it is....ANY shot on net can go in. Doesn't matter where it's from. Just ask Toskala! Lmao

You think a softy from the boards is the same as a boomer from 12ft out?   Still counts as a shot on net..  This is why scoring chances makes a lot more sense..."
845731,Stoty,2014-04-05 12:37:00,2910,"There's clearly less of a chance of it going in....but like I said ANY shot on net can go in. Plus if you're being outshot means your being outplayed, meaning your giving up more scoring chances (typically)."

Plus if you're being outshot means your being outplayed, meaning your giving up more scoring chances (typically).  This is what the Leafs did good in the previous few months..   Higher shot on net count, but scoring chances were low.   As of late, well we all know what happened.   This is why shots on net doesn't mean bunk if there isn't much of a chance for that puck to go in the net.  I'd also like to thank Chicago for the win lastnight!!!!!!"
845741,Stoty,2014-04-05 12:51:00,2910,"It's all up to your Leafs now. They've got help this far and have no choice but to win out. Honestly, I hope they do make it cause if not, most people around here will stop caring/watching and talking hockey. Gets lonely around here when it's only the Wings, Habs and Bruins that make it."
845753,BillM,2014-04-05 13:18:00,17367,"Yup, you're right if they want to be in the playoffs it will be up to them..  Boston was the big hurdle, now they've just gotta play hard smart hockey until the end.  Where ever the dice fall when it's all said and done, who knows."
845755,kickingfrog,2014-04-05 13:25:00,8333,WINGS!!!!!!! Looks good for 23 straight! Wooooo  But they've been going backwards for years. Have to see how the transition continues next season.
845768,dracokaos,2014-04-05 14:24:00,116,"I know its just the Jets tonight but its still a big test. No Bernier in net. They have to play in front of Reimer, and they can't let 40+ shots.....I hope they can get it together and give Reimer a fighting chance."
845778,John Bacon,2014-04-05 14:42:00,3277,"Unfortunately, playing weak teams doesn't seem to help the Leafs win.  I.e. look that trouble they have had against Buffalo this year."

845788,Oggie,2014-04-05 15:01:00,588,YeaH TRADE Tuka Raska and keep Toskola ......  Boy that was great Burkey trade eh! As soon as he did that my son who is a goalie said .....huh... they traded the wrong guy!!!!! Boy was he bang on! Dan O.

845842,Stoty,2014-04-05 19:02:00,2910,Hard to be going backwards making the playoffs 22 straight seasons. Lmao With all the young talent coming from Grand Rapids...I'm pretty excited to see the next chapter that's for sure.
845856,kickingfrog,2014-04-05 19:46:00,8333,Year over year. Look at the play-off record. Look at the points. Look at where they are finishing in the standings. They moved to a softer conference (top to bottom) this year and still are brining up the rear. The only thing missing is the beeping sound.
845865,Stoty,2014-04-05 21:05:00,2910,"Don't be a ""hater"" as Leafs nation would say. LOL. They're only the most consistent team in all of professional sports. And with young guys like Nyquist, Sheahan, Helm and Tatar (and Mantha in the minors) they'll only get better. Combine them with the talent they currently have (when healthy, lol)....they can do some serious damage. They matchup quite well with Pit so if they get them in the first round, there might be an uspet in the making. Especially if Zetts comes back and Howard stays hot."
845870,kickingfrog,2014-04-05 21:24:00,8333,Facts are facts. No name games here.  Most play-off matches are not what they were 10-15 years ago. There are few easy match-ups. That doesn't mean the wings are heading in the right direction.
845886,davey buoy,2014-04-05 22:47:00,5505,"Just about time,let the excitement begin!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Go Leafs Go!!"
845899,manitoubass2,2014-04-05 23:15:00,11391,"Excited for the game!!!! KF i still wish they're eliminate the divisions/conferences for playoffs. Go solely on a point system. That way all the best teams are in, and it would create new rivalries. I'd love to see match ups like Chicago vs LA in the first round, that would be awesome! To me it sucks when a team in the east with 82 points makes it, and a team from the west with 9o points is off golfing. (Numbers exaggerated but you get the point)"

845547,Stoty,2014-04-04 14:15:00,2910,Did you forget they also have 2 games in hand? As do CBJ.....  Det only needs 6 pts out of the remaining 7 games to clinch. Leafs have to win them all plus hope for a bunch of help.  Those spots are DET/CBJ's to lose at this point.
845549,BillM,2014-04-04 14:28:00,17367,"You're assuming they're going to win those two games now?  heh.  Also, have you looked at Detroits schedule?  St.Louis?  Pittsburg?  Like I said.... chickens... don't count them yet."
845550,Stoty,2014-04-04 14:33:00,2910,"Considering 2 of the next 3 are against BUF.... I sure hope so. lol  BUF, MTL, BUF, PIT, CAR, STL  Sounds like playoffs to me...but stranger things have happened!  Then again... Datsyuk is back as of tonight, so here's hoping him and Nyquist tear it up together!"
845552,Acountdeleted,2014-04-04 14:38:00,2562,"I'm not even eyeing Detroit. The 8th spot and bumping Columbus out is our only hope. Whats rough is Columbus gets a game against Dallas where they start up 1-0 because of the game that had to be rescheduled. Talk about odds against the leafs.

If Bostons main stay ( Tuukka Rask) was in between the pipes last night,I think it would of been a total different out come. First period was full of energy,but way to many turn overs. Like they said,their playing Leaf hockey. LMAO.  I also will say, if that was Reim in net last night,not a hope in hell we would of been that close.  Anyone notice how Chara seems to be a step behind? Didn't look or play like the big man he is known to be. Even his shots seemed to be off. Power wise.  Well if the leafs get in,Im on the wagon. If they don't,Bruins all the way."

Could have sworn James Reimer was the best goalie in the league last year...but he's the biggest bum this year according to most of Leafs nation. Biggest fairweather fan base in sports. They're the best team in the league when they're winning...but quick to point fingers when they go on their (semi-annual) collapses."

That hurts my feelings!  But the Sens just won and are 2 points behind the laffs with a game in hand, sooooo.....I feel a bit better!  Once the laffs totally blow the playoff run, and in spectacular form as always,and the Sens finish ahead of them, I will feel a lot better!  "

Unbeatable the first 10ish games each year (so they're ""cup contenders""), barely get through the middle 60 games and have a huge fail during the last 10ish games of the season. Classic Laughs.  The only way they can make the playoffs is when its a shortened/modified season. Gee.... big shocker!  Have to admit watching all the Leaf fans turn into ""haters"" is hilarious!!! So who's fault is the latest collapse...........refs? Riemers? Princess Phaneuf? Sidney Kadri?  :rofl2:  :rofl2:  :rofl2:  GO WINGS GO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 23rd season in a row... here we come!

844834,Billy - Curtiss,2014-04-01 14:01:00,241,"When you look at what Patrick Roy has done this year with the Colorado Avalanche, you wonder what a different coach could do with the current Leafs roster. I think it's time to show Carlyle the door. The guy was a defence man and a decent one at that. How it is that he can't get the Leafs playing a tighter game defensively is beyond me. Bring on Doug Gilmour as head coach. This collapse definitely is worse than game 7 against the Bruins. I never expected them to make it that far. Two weeks or so ago, I thought the Leafs would easily make the cut."
844835,craigdritchie,2014-04-01 14:07:00,1586,"Stoty,  I called this before the season even began. And I will fearlessly predict they go nowhere next year either.  What threw me off this year is the utter collapse at the end. Usually they're unbeatable in the last two weeks, ensuring they don't even get a decent draft pick."
844836,Mike Pike,2014-04-01 14:29:00,1332,That's it!  I'm done with 'em.  Tired of cheering for a loser!  I'm gonna start following the Jays now...
844842,jedimaster,2014-04-01 14:57:00,3472,Wow. Really? I could never not cheer for the leafs. You guys are all sounding like Sens fans.
844843,Stoty,2014-04-01 15:03:00,2910," Couldn't agree more!  It's their management/coaching that's the main issue. STUPID move after stupid move.  IMO the Leafs need the following: - new management (all positions) that actually care about their fan-base and icing a winning team instead of lining their pockets. - a #1 centerman to be able to play with Kessel/JVR - #1 Dman cause most of the ones they have now are HORRIBLE. - LOWER ticket prices to get the ""suits"" out and the ""fans"" in - UNLOAD Phaneuf & Kadri, use their cash towards (useful) players.  I think the Leafs have a solid core, but are missing the few key pieces in order to make the playoffs on a consistent basis. Take some notes from Detroit's management.... there's a reason they were both picked to run Team Canada."
844851,BillM,2014-04-01 15:50:00,17367,"Can we trade Reims, Kuli and Raymond for Stamkos straight up?  lol"
844868,Stoty,2014-04-01 17:01:00,2910, PS3 or Xbox?
844870,jedimaster,2014-04-01 17:08:00,3472,Maybe Karlsson. I hear he wants to go to a cup contender like Chara.
844872,Headhunter,2014-04-01 17:26:00,5703,"Yes, there are some ""questionable"" guys playing in this curent leaf team and I think most fans know who they are... But, I think that the biggest challenge they face is a complete lack of leadership both off and on the ice. I'll take bets that Bolland is gone after this year and really, did we get anything out of him? I'm sure management had hoped he would fill that void, but obviously not. Dion is not a leader... end of story. It's gonna be a real challenge to get any free agents to come to the Leafs for obvious reasons. Trades are their only hope. Randy is not the problem... IMHO. I'm expecting the drought to last well into the 50 year mark. HH"
844879,leaf4,2014-04-01 18:16:00,2466,"I don't see why bolland wouldn't fit? he was a huge part of the early success, now clarkson I would like to see gone or at max 3mill/year"

Take some notes from Detroit's management.... there's a reason they were both picked to run Team Canada. I agree with all of the above, except Kadri and ill get to that... management has been a joke for as long as I have been alive..Its clearly all about the $$ Dion's no trade clause kicks in at the start of next season, so if he doesnt get traded before then were stuck with him. As For Naz, why get rid of him? he is a perfect 3rd line centre that can score 20 or more..I say keep him.. The Leafs have one buyout left, i say use it on Clarkson. Lowered tickte prices would be nice but that wont ever happen..The suits will just buy up the rest of the seats, if it did.. We need the #1 center we have been looking for since Sundin left.. I would like to see Bolland signed to a contract extension for 3 to 5 more years.. The Leafs aren't out of this yet..All they have to do is win. As long as they have a chance I will remain hopeful..I only ask that they dont fall behind Ottawa cause Im not ready to read what Matt has to say..As of now its just babble as always..lol"
844892,BillM,2014-04-01 19:07:00,17367,"Trade Kadri?  He must have beat up Stoty as a kid for him to hate him so much    No way you trade away young talent like that...   the Leafs need leadership.. that's not coming from Phaneuf or Lups or anyone on the team currently (And no... not Clarkson either)...    As for ticket prices?  ehe, you'll never see ticket prices lowered if people are willing to buy them..."
844893,Maverick,2014-04-01 19:10:00,371,"Unfortunately (if you're a leafs fan) or fortunately (if you cheer for any other team in the league) Clarkson is stuck on the leafs until at least the final year of his contract.  The biggest problem is ""Number 3"". He wears that number because he knows that he is at best a number 3 D man on any good team in the league. He is great when he plays 15-18 minutes a game. When he is asked to play more he makes mental errors which end up in the back of the net, his own net. Like a few have said, he is not a leader, nor is anyone else on the team. When this guy is your number 1 defenceman, you're in trouble. In Calgary he was never asked to carry the puck as often or play big minutes like in TO. And like Clarkson, you leaf fans are stuck with him for the next 7 long years. Some cap comparables just for giggles are guys like Doughty, Weber, Karlsson, Pietrangelo, Suter, Kieth, Chara. Phaneuf's agent should win an award.  Anyway, my 2 cents, not a leafs fan but don't hate them. Would have liked to see them make the playoffs to have another Canadian team in the mix but oh well, wouldn't want to screw up those tee times like they did last year."
844902,davey buoy,2014-04-01 19:41:00,5505,"Coach for some reason changed his team from hitting to skating.This year I still believe are offense is not toooooooo bad,but I still think we need a defensive change,and some won't like this but also a #1 goalie.Bernier would be a pretty good back up.Way to many shots(as previously said),and wayyyyyyyyyy to much time in our end trying to get the puck outside the blue line.Let's not forget we have the #1 player with points against us in the whole league,and I think were stuck with him.  I love the Leafs,but can't even see them pulling out a win against Calgary.You bet I'll still be watching."
844903,Stoty,2014-04-01 19:42:00,2910,"Bill, you've already used that Kadri line.  It was funny the first time.  He's an arrogant, SALLY that stirs it up then runs away. Heck he even backed down from his mini-me in Gallagher. Lmao. Arrogant for no reason....he's completely unproven. He needs to go back to the AHL where he belongs."
844904,Headhunter,2014-04-01 19:45:00,5703,"Just to be clear on my Bolland statement... I would absolutely like to see him back, but as an UFA, why would he stay on this hornet's nest of a team? Management has had a history of not necessisarily making great decisions. I would think that he could land the same deal in a ton of other places and not have to deal with the circus that is Toronto. (And likely have a better chance at success as well!) HH"

844586,bushart,2014-03-31 12:29:00,2628,U Know---I'm watchin the Sens/Flames last nite---and the announcer made mention as Clarke McArthur (sp)---scored his 25th goal of the season  That Carlyle and Clark didn't get along and the coach wanted him gone---and said announcer couldn't figure out why he'd want to rid himself of a 25 goal scorer  Now I'm thinkin with the Leafs---there's lots of blame to spread around and the coach usually is the fall guy....but maybe?????
844593,BillM,2014-03-31 12:53:00,17367,McArthur wasn't a 25 goal scorer in Toronto..

Actually I am likely to watch even after they get eliminated. If they can turn this thing around and get a couple wins and get some help they have a chance going into the last few games.
844615,BillM,2014-03-31 14:48:00,17367,"Yup, gotta win against Calgary... Thursday against Boston is going to be a nasty event (I hope)"

Matt may say some things that get some of us a bit angry, but the truth of the matter is he's right. And that's what hurts the most. This most recent fail is just another chapter in a very thick book of failure. Carlyle has to be gone since he cannot get the players to play any system, and as for the players many of them need to look in the mirror. I enjoy watching Gardiner and Reilly speeding around the rink and believe they both have a great future. Looking forward to watching some great playoff games and enjoying some great hockey.

Maybe Tortorella will be available or Mike Keenan! The dark side of me says these guys have had nice coaches for too long. There was nothing wrong with Maurice, Wilson or Carlyle. Scotty Bowman would lose with the Leaf teams of the last 10 years. It's the  lack of good scouting and poor quality players as a result.  They would have gone off the cliff last year except it was a 40 game schedule.  Dan O."

Sure he has a hard shot, but he never hits the net, and nobody wants to screen the goalie because his shot is so unpredictable. He was a much better player on Calgary where he was given room to make the mistakes..  Also, Lupul is too injury prone to wear the ""C"", he may make a great captain, but the guy plays half seasons and is one hit away from having back surgery again..

Until the Laffs adopt a team concept and all play the same style, you'll be saying the same thing next year. I lived in the GTA for 33 years and I heard that song so many times with the same result. The NEW NHL allows the one dimensional players (read 'don't touch me' Kessel) to have long rich but basically useless careers. Teams that build on total team defense first do very well. Not even a concept in Taranta.  Same results every year. Smothering defenses and offensive hitting win.  muddler"

844330,Oggie,2014-03-30 01:44:00,588,I can't believe Nonis signed some of these expenssive vets. Shouldnt he pay the price? Carlyle didnt have much to work with.
844331,danc,2014-03-30 01:45:00,4677,That's it for me. I'm on Muskymatts side now.
844332,lookinforwalleye,2014-03-30 01:48:00,4399,Nobody going down with the ship???
844333,manitoubass2,2014-03-30 01:49:00,11391,"If I was the coach(lol), off season would be optional. We have a lot of skilled players, but many of them are totally off their game. If we scored this year like we did, but played tough, grimey hockey like last year, we'd have on heck of a team. what the hell happened???"
844105,lookinforwalleye,2014-03-29 01:51:00,4399,Did anybody notice dion and phil exchange words in the third...Phil did not look pleased and had some words for the Captain!!!
844108,Oggie,2014-03-29 02:05:00,588,So he misses a point blank opportunity at one end and then gloves the puck onto a phili player for a goal. Anew captain next year would be in the works and alot less icetime this year.
844109,Paulus,2014-03-29 02:07:00,522,"7 in a row = ""there's always next year""  most of the teams ahead, tied or behind them have games in hand  by now, even the most optimistic among us have to come to terms with it  feeling very sad    p.-"
844110,BillM,2014-03-29 02:19:00,17367,I love when the refs F around when dropping the puck.   It hasn't been this bad since the start of the season..
844118,kickingfrog,2014-03-29 02:55:00,8333,Is it possible it wasn't Reimer?
844119,kickingfrog,2014-03-29 03:01:00,8333,"On the up side I took my son to his first play-off game. Colts won 7-0 and finish off the Wolves 4-1, on to round 2."
844120,danc,2014-03-29 03:04:00,4677,"It's been a while since I've been on the board. I've been all over the north of the province in the past two weeks. Red Lake, Terrace Bay, Dryden, and then some. Fortunately I've only had to drive past two highway deaths on this highway to hell in that time. The last one was yesterday morning when a 24 year old kid was killed out outside of Dryden. I saw the rig piled into a rock cut, but there was no sign of the car that the kid was in. Anyways, on to my Leafs thoughts.  #1. Carlyle has to go. There's no reason that this club should be this bad defensively. Carlyle has done nothing to improve this. And yes, the talent is there.  #2. The Leafs are a young talented team that are a few years away from reaching their prime. They are one of the youngest teams in the league and I think that they have a bunch of key players that will be reaching their prime at the same/right time.  #3. Players being thrown under the bus by either Carlyle or Leafs fans. Reimer comes to mind first. Carlyle has completyely destroyed Reimer. Carlyle has a habit of dislikng a player and putting that before the team. If Reimer had lost tonights game, for example, Carlyle would have blamed him. Apparently it's ok when Bernier lets in a floater from the blue line. Bottom line here is that yes, Bernier should be the starter, but it would be nice to have a backup whose confidence wasn't destroyed by the coach. Second on my list is Dion being bashed by the fans. What more do you want from him? I'm sure that I don't have to mention that he is amongst the teams plus minus leaders while playing the most minutes per game against the leagues best lines. Yes he's no Drew Doughty, Shea Weber or Erik Karlson (sp), But the Leafs would be a lesser team without him.  Bottom line is that no team can be the best forever. It looks to me like both Pittsburgh and |Chicago are showing signs of fading. And I think that the Leafs are going in the other direction. But yes. Carlyle has to go."

I have been saying this all year..Even Team Canada traded the physical contact for boring lame ass hockey. Dion Phaneuf is an amazing hockey player when he does 2 things, Hits hard and his shot from the point..He quit hitting and wont shoot anymore. We lost Leo Komorav and signed Clarkson..Sigh.. No matter where Davd Clarkson s right now, I'm sure he just went off side and fell down... I find it disappointing with the teams effort as of late but I don't let it get to me. It is what it is..Playoffs or not im a Leaf fan and always will be.Proud to be a leaf fan and bleed blue. But phlease dump Orr and roll 4 lines.. Leafs recalled D'imagio (sp) lets hope for some extra spark and we get a win tonight to right this ship..Were still in it..GO LEAFS GO!!!!"

Hard hitting, pressuring the D in their own zone, etc etc.   They played about a period and a half like this against Philly lastnight and look what happens..  More time in the Philly zone then their own!  Also Bodie needs to be moved up from the 3rd line and played with Lups on #2."

844260,Oggie,2014-03-29 19:52:00,588,"You're right about Phaneuf. He doesn't handle the spotlight very well. I think removing the 'C"" would help him. He doesn't need the added pressure and right now he's playing like he is carrying  the team on his back. The captainsy is  the only think remaining from the Ron Wilson era.  The linesmen certainly became the feature act last night. Watch for Don Cherry to go nuts tonight!"

He said it was an early Jacques Plante style/brand. Now we're getting somewhere… until he comes back from the basement with his original mask.      He had painted it a few times.

And Pylon is a good defenceman? Please the guy is just a tool who no longer hits and fights (LOL) picks on the smaller guys. 8 million a year for a piece of trash is expensive. i dont have to talk to reimer to know that he was playing crap before carlyle made the comment SO IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH HIS THOUGHT PROCESS AT ALL. and i also know that pros deal with sports psychologists to learn ways to cope with such things. you not liking phaneuf is fine but just an opinion, i think he is overpaid as well, but my stats are factual and his arent that bad."

Compared to all other defensemen in the league he is 31st in time on ice and is consistently matched up against the oppositions top line, he has the 37th most shots, the 25th best plus/minus, and the 35th most points. As far as whether he deserves captaincy, none of you (myself included) would have a clue because your not in the dressing room. You dont get the C because your the best player.

It amazes me how we seem to know what the pros are thinking. I assume that Greenhorn spoke with Reimer and this was Reimers response? Always looking for excuses in LAFF land. And Pylon is a good defenceman? Please the guy is just a tool who no longer hits and fights (LOL) picks on the smaller guys. 8 million a year for a piece of trash is expensive."
843597,Headhunter,2014-03-26 12:58:00,5703,"I think Dion looks tired... he should probably take the next 7-8 years off to gain some strength back. Leadership in a team sport is hugely important and as the ""leader"" of this still very much young team, Dion looks to be completely inept and has for quite some time. He does not lead by example, he does not do the dirty work required to win and my biggest fear is that he is establishing a performance standard that the young guys are told to look up to. And to make matters worse, he's virtually un-tradable given his current contract.  At this rate, there won't be any Canadian teams making the playoffs...ba ha! HH"

843052,muddler,2014-03-24 12:13:00,623,"Before any Laff's fan goes off the deep end and freaks out, this is not meant as a put down. What is, is.  Hockey is a real simple game. Play the offence when you have the puck and play defense when the opposition has the puck. The goal tender is the last line of the defense. It is the job of ALL 5 players to 'protect the house'. Not 4 players, not just the D-men, ALL 5!  You don't need five skilled players to play offence. It can be done with 1,2,3,4 or 5 players in a given situation. But DEFENSE is a full team effort. Winning teams buy into that and they win. Look at the Canadian Olympic men's team.  Sidney Crosby(yes he is the best right now) bought into it and they won the gold. Edmonton has a ton of skilled players and no defense, look where they are. The Laffs have a few players that play both ways all the time , but a few just won't cut it in this league. It's all or nothing.  Any NHL player can put the puck into the net. Some better than others but they all can do it. That's why they are pros. Any player can play defense(except maybe for 81), it is a mind set. Defense doesn't reward a player very often with glowing personal stats and fat contracts but it wins a ton of games. One player doesn't make a defense, but one player can sure ruin it. Point the finger at the those one dimensional skill players players that have cost the Leafs yet another season. That is where the real problem is.  I'm a hockey fan first , a Bruin fan second. There are two many over paid skilled half players in the new NHL. Through miracle goal tending the Laffs have a shot at a playoff spot. When the miracles have run dry the Loaf fans point the finger at the person that got them there in the first place. Shame on ya! It's not the coach, it's the idiots on the ice that simply will not check anyone on the opposition.  I watched Malkin last night in some highlights and he is constantly dragging some player draped all over him to the net. He gets physical when he's after the puck. When is the last time 81 went to the net and risked an opposing player to body check him? When is the lat time 81 ever hit anybody with a body check? It's so funny it's sad and the Fan go on about him like he's next Crobsy. It will never happen. As Brian Burke said, ""...this isn't flag football...."".  LA, Anaheim, Boston, San Jose  all play a great defense. Real hockey teams. They win consistently.  It's not the coach, it's not the goaltender, IT""S THE TOTAL LACK OF TEAM DEFENSE.  Before you blame the tires on the car, check the driver's habits first!  muddler"
843063,Jigger,2014-03-24 13:10:00,1237," Edit: totally agree with your post muddler. Dont see Kessel throwing big checks on anyone though, he plays a speed game."
843066,glen,2014-03-24 13:41:00,2641,"""LA, Anaheim, Boston, San Jose  all play a great defense. Real hockey teams. They win consistently.""  Did these teams come up with this style of play on there own or does the coach demand it?"
843077,grimsbylander,2014-03-24 14:50:00,3016,"I don't care to see Kessel throwing hits. There are lots of able bodies on that team capable of playing much more physical and aren't #3 on the scoring list.   Muddler, good points. It is not lost on anyone that the Leafs would be in a very different position right now if they were getting average goaltending thus far. Not bad goaltending, just average. Giving up 30-40 shots on net a game inherently puts all the responsibility on the goalie. Probably why the finger pointing now. All I expect from Reimer is to make the easy stops. Regardless of total number of shots on goal, odd man rushes or breakaways, he is still responsible for the soft goals. The rest of the team is responsible for ALL the rest.  On a lighter note...Reimer reminds me of a kid we had playing goal on one of my son's teams. He used to drop into the butterfly about the time the puck would cross the blue line...sound familiar?? We used to joke about bungee cording him to the cross bar so he had to challenge the shooters and take away the top part of the net. The image of the kid dropping down and immediately getting fired up to his feet had all the coaches laughing!! I think I'll email Carlyle."
843078,jimmer,2014-03-24 14:51:00,2730,Interesting how the team played a little better defensively when Mac was put in. Maybe my imagination though.
843089,BillM,2014-03-24 15:38:00,17367,"They definitely had a jump to their step once the switch was made.   Let's give the Jersey goalie credit, he made some saves that should have been goals."

842910,leaf4,2014-03-23 17:20:00,2466,"It's true, I liked the team decisions much more with Burkie at the helm, I don't understand why Carlyle consistently plays 3 lines and has the 4th line on for 2-3 mins a night, when he could have holland and Ashton in place of Mclaren and Orr  that being said, I'm going to the Winnipeg game April 5th, pondering a sign I can make for randy something to the likes of ""defence wins championships not dumping on your goalie "" lol"
842915,kickingfrog,2014-03-23 17:40:00,8333,The search is over. The new Leafs' goalie has been found.   
842937,BillM,2014-03-23 19:27:00,17367,"I dont blame just 1 guy its the whole team. I will say when your goalie consistently lets in 2 softies in the first 5 minutes, you dont stand a chance. But the defense has been brutal and the coaching choices blow my mind. Dont play Holland or Ashton and dress the likes of Orr.  The way Reims has been treated says allot of coach Randy, he needs to go IMHO. One other observation is Bolland last-night, the man had more hits then the rest of the team in the last 3 games. What happened to the most hated team to play against? This was just last year? All to often I see opposing guys getting 2nd and 3rd shots by sticking around out front..Hit the guy, he cant score on his Ass, don't just stand there and let them score. There is lots wrong with the team and its all fixable with just a little effort. We have to hit hard and hit often, Randy needs to stop with the stupid lineup choices and his ignorant comments. Why do Orr and Mcleran (sp) get starts when Ashton and Holland look good out there?  I wish the current team played like they did last year.  Hard hitting, no holds bar, defense on the opposite team were always worried about getting creamed, one of the toughest teams in the league..  This year?  We've got Clarkson running around throwing late hits, taking penalties..  I just don't get what Carlyle is doing.  Sure the record is great, but man we need some of that rough and tumble stuff from last year down the stretch.."
842942,misfish,2014-03-23 19:57:00,29133,"  How about a guy in front of the net. You know,the screen guy. I cant believe they use this rope a dope crap. I guess the new sticks shoot to hard and no one wants to get hit with the puck at 100+mph.  There needs to be some kind of sacrafice made.  Defence is another spot like mentioned.  I tried to play like Orr in my years of playing. Thats Bobby not Cort,but I did have some Cort times.LOL He was my and still is my idol for the best defense man to ever play the game.. Slide in front of shots to block from getting to the goalie. I like him,ended up with bad knees,but I dont regret it one bit. Sure I didnt play the top level,but knew what team play meant. Together as one.  There wasnt a team I played for,from when I started at house league up to Miget rep, that if you blamed another player,you were sitting the next game.  This is what the great Canadian game is missing.  So ya coach,have a seat and think about it/  To much money and big contracts have made the game the way it is now.  They all think,,I just got paid.  Many forget who got them there,,,,,,,,,,,,,,  Parents money. Hard earned money for most."

But somewhere along the line, the floaters from the blue line that Bernier has let in have been forgotten. Not to mention his puck handling blunders that have cost a few goals. Bernier is our #1 now. That I agree with. But Carlyle has terribly mismanaged the fact the we have (had) two #1 goalies. His defensive coaching abilities totally suck. We have no defense at all."

The numbers suggest the Leafs need to fix some team problems...despite some players having decent years the team numbers are rather lackluster....  27th in penalty killing 10 shorties allowed 30th in shots allowed 24th in shot for 25th in shut outs 26th in goals against  Now if coach Carlyle has instituted the perfect system for his players to succeed then it`s the players fault if not then Carlyle needs to re-examine his system.  My casual observation tells me that the Leafs have been out played by their opposition for the most part this year and the numbers bare this out!!!

842879,misfish,2014-03-23 15:13:00,29133," Well if the leafs do get in the back door of the playoffs,lets see how well he does. The play offs are a whole new game. Lose and your out. No second chances."
842881,pairofgreenhorns,2014-03-23 15:19:00,133,"This is very true, I think because of berniers demeanour he will be fine, but if they sneak into the playoffs they will most likely be against boston or Pittsburgh so I'm not very optimistic. Hey who knows maybe bernier is the horse they ride to the playoffs and Reimer is the one they ride during playoffs lol. If that happens I will take back everything negative I said about Reimer. Haha"
842885,pairofgreenhorns,2014-03-23 15:44:00,133,"Here is how I have the season ending,  New York rangers 92 pts Detroit red wings 91pts -wildcard Columbus 90 pts -wildcard Cutoff Toronto 90 pts Washington 88 points  Really need Columbus to play below .500 the rest of the year. Fingers crossed Toronto plays above .500"
842899,tb4me,2014-03-23 16:37:00,3295,"I dont blame just 1 guy its the whole team. I will say when your goalie consistently lets in 2 softies in the first 5 minutes, you dont stand a chance. But the defense has been brutal and the coaching choices blow my mind. Dont play Holland or Ashton and dress the likes of Orr.  The way Reims has been treated says allot of coach Randy, he needs to go IMHO. One other observation is Bolland last-night, the man had more hits then the rest of the team in the last 3 games. What happened to the most hated team to play against? This was just last year? All to often I see opposing guys getting 2nd and 3rd shots by sticking around out front..Hit the guy, he cant score on his Ass, don't just stand there and let them score. There is lots wrong with the team and its all fixable with just a little effort. We have to hit hard and hit often, Randy needs to stop with the stupid lineup choices and his ignorant comments. Why do Orr and Mcleran (sp) get starts when Ashton and Holland look good out there?"

All I'm saying is he will never be number 1 in Toronto so let's trade him and get something useful for our team in return.  I agree it should have been handled differently with the media but I don't think randy meant it the way it came out   Number 1,Ok  LEAF hype about the monster,#1,gone   Eddie the Eagle,,,,#1  gone  Cujo,,,,,,,#1          gone  Before them  Potvin  Wregget  I dont see where the goalie is to blame in the history here.

842778,kickingfrog,2014-03-23 01:34:00,8333,Craig Simpson is dumber then a sack of broken hammers.
842779,pairofgreenhorns,2014-03-23 01:38:00,133,Lmao.... I wish they would have traded him at the deadline as it seems his stock is declining. HOPE he bounces back.

As a father of a goalie,going from double A to triple A,through Atom to Midget,I have seen it all.  Three bad games in a league game,but touny on the weekend and gets 4 MVP 4 games straight.  I could still play by play those games."
842783,kickingfrog,2014-03-23 01:45:00,8333,"y  Ya he should have known better but what he said last week is not the reason Reimer has been under performing almost all year long He's been in his head since at least December when he yanked him against the wings. All year the coach has handled the 2 goalies differently. It can be argued that just the way it goes, but the reality is that it has had a negative impact on Remier. The job of the coach is to win and he hasn't helped the team win by messing with Remier."
842784,Dan668,2014-03-23 01:47:00,1120,Should of taken dubnyk. He went for future considerations.
842785,jedimaster,2014-03-23 01:49:00,3472,Bernier is a better goalie than Reimer. Why would Reimer start over bernier. Its the goalie coach to keep the backup sharp. I would have rather scrivens stayed as a backup. At least he would have accepted the role.
842786,kickingfrog,2014-03-23 01:50:00,8333,"""cause he sucks and is in the minors.  Edit to add that I was talkin' bout Dubnyk"
842789,muddler,2014-03-23 01:54:00,623,"Now, now boys, it's just a game. He he he he he he,"
842791,kickingfrog,2014-03-23 01:57:00,8333,Big surprise that the Bruins fan is tone deaf. That's the only explanation for Rene Rancourt.
842797,danc,2014-03-23 03:07:00,4677,"Leafs make the playoffs, Reimer is gone. Leafs don't make the playoffs, Carlyle is gone. Carlyle has a history of throwing players under the bus. Personally I'd like to see Carlyle gone. Theres no way that a team with this much talent can be so bad defensively without some sort of game plan. Apparently there is no such plan in Leafs land. The Leafs have a bunch of young fast skating defensemen, with no direction. The offence is clearly talented enough to handle itself. Dump Carlyle and get someone in there that can put up a defensive plan. The sooner the better Imho."
842801,glen,2014-03-23 03:26:00,2641,Carlyle is the problem. He is finding a way  to get least out of the players.
842802,pairofgreenhorns,2014-03-23 03:27:00,133,"Amazing for your son, glad to hear that! You sound like a great hockey dad!  As for the leafs though, when your backup loses the majority of the games he plays they would be better off with anyone there provided they get something useful in return for Reimer. I'm not defending Carlyle in anyway but maybe his treatment of Reimer was his way of giving nonis a hint to trade him. This is all speculation of course. But if we got a solid stay at home defenseman or improved at centre at the cost of trading Reimer I think we would be better off for it. Whether it's carlyles fault, the teams fault, or reimers fault what's done is done. Bernier is a stud in net, although unproven in playoffs in Toronto I feel like he can thrive in this tough to play in hockey market. That makes Reimer expendable in my opinion."
842803,pairofgreenhorns,2014-03-23 03:29:00,133,That's a bold statement when players are having personal best seasons.
842805,glen,2014-03-23 03:33:00,2641,Good point but no playoffs and how does it look
842807,glen,2014-03-23 03:38:00,2641,One of the tv talking heads said clarkson doesn't know where to skate next because the players are all over the ice.  It does look odd. Let's have Gartner go deep all the time so a forword can cover him on D

Funny how Bernier let in 9 goals in two back to back games (including one that he practically scored on himself) after the olympics, and he is the next thing to a goaltending God now. I just dont get it."
842809,BillM,2014-03-23 03:43:00,17367,"I dunno if it's Carlyle....  Those first two goals were soft, no way Reims should have let those in.  Then look at the posts the Leafs hit tonight, Gardiner, Reilly and JVR, 2 of those go in an it's a different game.  Puck isn't bouncing our way, let's hope they straighten things out or it's going to be a long off season."
842810,pairofgreenhorns,2014-03-23 03:44:00,133,"Ya if they don't make it it doesn't look good. We have to remember they are one of the five youngest teams in the league. I would argue that if bozak, Bolland, and bernier weren't injured and gardiner and Reilly were a little further along in there development we would be in second place in our division consistently throughout the year. So I hope they don't get rid of Carlyle just yet. If next year they aren't doing well by mid season, then I would let him go."
842811,glen,2014-03-23 03:48:00,2641,Carlyle should know the D is weak and the goalie needs help. I blame him for not making an adjustment.
842730,kickingfrog,2014-03-23 00:12:00,8333,What was the over/under? Back in the 80's again.

842734,pairofgreenhorns,2014-03-23 00:19:00,133,"Really excited to see Gardiner playing well, seems to be coming into his own"
842737,misfish,2014-03-23 00:29:00,29133,"  If you had a coach in yer ear,how would you play ?  He need to pull a Patrick Roy move . Go ahead trade me. he,ll play better just like the rest that have been moved.LOL"
842743,pairofgreenhorns,2014-03-23 00:50:00,133,"Have a coach in you ear? He's a professional goalie, not a four year old. I'm in sales, when I don't sell I lose my job and my director is in my ear letting me know. Stop feeling sorry for him and start realizing that he is not playing like crap because of Carlyle, he's playing bad because he constantly lets in soft goals, he is his own worst enemy right now. He lost confidence when they brought in bernier, which as a professional he should have known was a possibility. If bringing in a new goalie has that big of an effect then he can't play in a hockey market like Toronto. I like Reimer and appreciate everything he has done for us but he needs to go, he can't track the puck, control rebounds, or hold a puck in his glove if he is even fortunate enough to get his glove in front of it. Just my opinion but that comment that he was just okay was blown out of proportion by a media guy. Carlyle didn't say it the way it was taken by the media or how it was portrayed by Reimer.  That's my 2 cents anyway"
842744,BillM,2014-03-23 00:50:00,17367,"I missed the first period, how soft were teh 3 goals Reims let in? lol"
842747,kickingfrog,2014-03-23 00:58:00,8333,If that were true then why call a player out? If they are a pro and don't need their tires pumped then surely telling them they're not good enough is equally ineffective.  A good coach understands that there are three levels of conversation.  What he says in front to the media.  What he says in front of the team.  What he says privately to a player.   No good was going to come from Randy saying that to the media and if he doesn't understand that then he will be moving on.
842748,pairofgreenhorns,2014-03-23 00:58:00,133,"First two were very soft, third one was a give away by Gleason, then a shot that tipped off of Gleason in, he didn't have a chance. Bad give aways but he still should have had them, he was off his angle for the second goal, and just failed to make a save on the first."
842749,Dan668,2014-03-23 00:59:00,1120,Let's pray Mac is in net tomorrow. Or we can just kiss play offs goodbye

842751,lookinforwalleye,2014-03-23 01:01:00,4399,They were all high light reel type goals!!!
842752,pairofgreenhorns,2014-03-23 01:01:00,133,"I agree with your comment but I don't think he called him out, he was asked how he thought Reimer played and I'm sure he could have chosen better words but it was nothing really. He said okay, just okay, as in not terrible, but not great."

I would never want anyone ever hurt, well maybe a slight leg injury to kessle! Ahem, anyways,   , can you say without a doubt he had no responsibility putting himself in that situation?? I'm ecstatic that it's likely not going to be used by all the do gooders as fuel in a "" remove hitting from the game"" or "" we have to replace those hard, player unfriendly boards with foam padding"" nauseating debate!  I do agree with most of the analysts that these guys have to play smarter, and know they can't be putting themselves in a vulnerable position. The game is too fast for microsecond changes."

He is close enough. Players are taught from a very young age that the first player takes the body and the second grabs the puck. Ranger put himself in that position by switching directions at the last second. There is nothing you can do in real time to change the course at that point. I am a die hard leafs fan but the call that was made was the right call and no further suspension should occur because he has no history of dirty pla to my knowledge, Killorn stopped skating (wasn't charging Ranger), he attempted to slow up (snow fly's up off his slates) and Ranger made a last second adjustment.

It is very easy for me to discredit anything you say about the sport of hockey because there is nothing worse than a person who jumps from one team to another for any reason.  I understand your frustration though muskymatt, your team has never beat us in a playoff series, there are just as many leaf fans at your home games as sens fans, and here you are without a hope of making the playoffs trying to stick it to a team that has a shot.

842004,lookinforwalleye,2014-03-19 02:35:00,4399,Its tough when your leading scorer goes MIA phil the thrill does that from time to time.
842005,lookinforwalleye,2014-03-19 02:40:00,4399,On a positive note nice game by the Habs and the hatty for Vanek!!!!

842060,Oggie,2014-03-19 17:53:00,588,I wish the Leafs training staff would sharpen Kessels left skate edges so he could cut in off of the right wing across the face of the net once in awhile.  Oh yeah ...... the defensemen trailing on the breakaway would put him through the net .... now I understand. Don't go where the bad people go Phil! Dan O.
842064,BillM,2014-03-19 18:06:00,17367,Seems like lots of guys flailing around against Detroit.. Let's hope we have a better game tonight!!!
842065,muddler,2014-03-19 18:10:00,623,Holy cow! I just read this in the Sun on line.  http://www.torontosun.com/2014/03/18/maple-leafs-take-on-red-wings-in-detroit  Just about the only shining light for the Leafs are their goaltenders that have carried this sad sack team on their backs and this is the thanks you get? Reimer stood on his head for a couple of spectacular stops. He single handedly kept the Loafs close. That is ALL you'd what from a quality net minder. What a joke. And you wonder why we don't like them? No wonder they're called the Laffs.  Bruins have won 10 straight......just saying......muddler
842066,grimsbylander,2014-03-19 18:25:00,3016,"Muddler, the Bruins have won 10 straight because they're a good team playing really well. No argument. But watch out for the karma...choking out like last year and being one of the other 29 losers in the league gives you bragging right to NOTHING. I'd save the finger pointing until after they hoist the cup, which sure won't be this season! West = cup.  My opinion on Reimer is the same as last year...Great on the flop, weak on the shot!"
842067,kickingfrog,2014-03-19 18:26:00,8333,Dispite the league having  a blanket policy on cameras my experience is that it is enforced very differently from one rink to the next.  Basically if it is a team that doesn't sell out you can walk in with a bazooka of a lens and they'll just ask you to not get in the way of the other fans. They don't do squat about the bozos that video everything with their portable devices. The league is in the dark ages. This the same league that resisted putting names on the backs of sweaters because the owners were worried about program sales. Inbreeding.

841882,kickingfrog,2014-03-18 18:58:00,8333,"Apparently the NHL never considered that the 2 wildcard teams could end up playing against a team from the other division and are considering a change for next year.  As an example, right now the Leafs have the 1st wildcard position (sort of 7th, but not really) and would play Pittsburgh (2nd). The Rangers are the 2nd wildcard (8th) and would play Boston(1st). If the league changes things for next year then the teams would switch and even though the Bruins have the most points they would have a ""tougher"" first round opponent then the second place Pens.  So, for clarity, they have a bad play-off format and are thinking about changing it... by making it worse.  Perfect example of the problems caused by inbreeding."

They were celebrating the 10th anniversary of the Lightning's Stanley Cup win and had a good number of the players and staff there for the celly.    They were handing out replica's of the Stanley Cup ring to all in attendance too!!! Pretty hefty and major bling factor.    My buddy Sam and I macking out with the bling rings yo!!!   Here are a bunch of other shots from the game.        Tort's being his usual happy self!!!            One more game left for me next week before I head home.
841935,tb4me,2014-03-18 22:41:00,3295,Nice shots! So how do you get to bring a camera in the building? I thought there wasn't any allowed..

Have the Sens fans started to blame the refs yet?  I like all the crybaby slamming of the sticks as well!!  Stay classy!
841562,tb4me,2014-03-16 16:35:00,3295,I find it funny that the sens make history and all that can be talked about is the Leafs..You know you must be miserable when.....The Canadiens became the 1st team in NHL history to win a game after trailing by three goals in the final five minutes of the third period.Montreal was down 4-1 but scored 3 times in the final 3:22 before winning in OT.
841565,Fisherpete,2014-03-16 16:44:00,1814,4 games into a 5 game road trip and the Leafs have captured 6 out of a possible 8 points including wins in Anaheim and LA - breaking the Kings 8 game winning streak Reimer steps in after Bernier tweaks his knee and leads them to a win in LA and then a brilliant 1 goal on 50 shot win last night in Washington  I'd say things are looking just fine!

On to the next one. Yup any positive blip in the win column and the Laff's fans dust off the floats for the parade. It will be a short playoff with so many one dimensional players . Keep hoping and keep jumping on the band wagon. It makes it that much nicer when the Loafs fall out.  If you look back to the Olympic men's hockey teams. How well did Miss Kessel(don't touch or I'll pas or shoot) do against Canada. Oh, sorry, he was on fire! I forgot. What king of medal did the Americans come away with? Oh yeah, a roll of tape.  Gimme a break, Laffs are playing their playoff hockey now. When the real show starts, so will the rest of their opponents.  The way to get to Miss Kessel is to hide his toque or knock off his helmet. He's so worried that someone might notice his receding hairline that he can't concentrate on anything less.  Amazingly Miss Dion didn't score on her own goal last night,  Same old Laffs, same old blah,blah. Keep hoping guys, there's always next year!  muddler   I love being a Leafs fan because this seems to happen every single year at least 82 times (maybe more).  Us Leafs fans are sitting around, 'Hey. That was a good game. Wow Reimer played really well. The team is looking good.' Etc etc.  Then a Montreal or Ottawa or Boston fan comes along ""Laffs fans are busting out the parade balloons again, planning the route. Any sign of optimism and Laffs fans think they are the best team in the league"".  I'm not going to go back and read 173 pages but I'm pretty sure not once has anyone said 'The leafs are cup bound this year. This is our year.' They are playing well, it looks like they are going to make the playoffs and it will make for an exciting post season. That's all.  I find it funny how everyone but Maple Leafs fans seems to get the most excited when the Leafs are doing well. Geez, if only you all had that kind of excitement towards your own teams."

841195,muddler,2014-03-14 12:45:00,623,"On a wing and a prayer. When the goaltenders are consistently hammered with so many shots per game, it is just a matter of time that they get hurt. On to the next one. Yup any positive blip in the win column and the Laff's fans dust off the floats for the parade. It will be a short playoff with so many one dimensional players . Keep hoping and keep jumping on the band wagon. It makes it that much nicer when the Loafs fall out.  If you look back to the Olympic men's hockey teams. How well did Miss Kessel(don't touch or I'll pass or shoot) do against Canada. Oh, sorry, he was on fire! I forgot. What kind of medal did the Americans come away with? Oh yeah, a roll of tape.  Gimme a break, Laffs are playing their playoff hockey now. When the real show starts, so will the rest of their opponents.  The way to get to Miss Kessel is to hide his toque or knock off his helmet. He's so worried that someone might notice his receding hairline that he can't concentrate on anything less.  Amazingly Miss Dion didn't score on her own goal last night,  Same old Laffs, same old blah,blah. Keep hoping guys, there's always next year!  muddler"

840801,BillM,2014-03-12 03:41:00,17367,Reims puck control is awful.
840802,leaf4,2014-03-12 03:53:00,2466,can you blame him though with getting a start every 4+ games?
840803,BillM,2014-03-12 03:56:00,17367,can you blame him though with getting a start every 4+ games?  For the ability to stop rebounds?  I don't think that's got anything to do with starting vs not starting.
840804,leaf4,2014-03-12 04:09:00,2466,"being a goalie myself it certainly does, playing target in practice is a whole different ball game than having big bodies and traffic in front of you, as you have in a game situation, so if you can stop that puck even if it gives a rebound you get whatever you can muster in front of it"
840805,danc,2014-03-12 04:13:00,4677,"Reimer has had his confidence robbed by Carlyle this year. It was Reimer that took the Leafs to the playoffs last year. Along comes Bernier, with barely any NHL stats to speak of, and Carlyle basically hands him the starting role. I agree that Bernier is the man now but I don't think that Reimer got a fair shake this year. I hope he gets traded because he deserves better than what he's getting now. Bernier has looked like a pee wee player plenty of times himself this year. In fact I blame him for two of the Leafs first 3 losses after the olympics. The time when he basically scored on himself and also when he smothered the puck inside the circle for a penalty that cost the Leafs the game."
840806,BillM,2014-03-12 04:24:00,17367,"Let's hope if Reims gets a starting spot somewhere else, we get something good in return."

The time when he basically scored on himself and also when he smothered the puck inside the circle for a penalty that cost the Leafs the game. I get your comment but if Reimer started more games truth is that we'd have a worse record. He is not as good as Bernier and Bernier earned the starting role. Reimer has trouble with confidence, high glove shots, and rebound control, he is not nearly as good at tracking the puck and when it hits him he rarely knows where it ends up (awareness). At this point I do not believe Reimer will ever be a legitimate starting goalie in the NHL until he improves these faults. don't get me wrong i like the kid but Reimer did this to himself by under-performing, it had nothing to do with Carlyle. When your a coach you play the goalie that gives you the best chance of winning and that's what he did. Just my 2 cents"
840810,Dan668,2014-03-12 05:25:00,1120,Why does he always fall forward and flop on the ice leaving the whole net open. The leafs as a whole played terrible. But the goals were pretty soft. It's obvious bernier is the better tender
840811,pairofgreenhorns,2014-03-12 05:34:00,133,"the leafs haven't been playing very well since the Olympics really, even people were saying great game against Anaheim. maybe great first period. if it wasn't for bernier they would have lost by 3 goals, they were out shot for the billionth time this year 44-23. They have allowed the second most goals in the third period out of all NHL teams. If it wasn't for Phil being on a tear, Bernier playing unbelievable and most of our players having an unsustainable inflated shooting percentage we wouldn't even be near the playoff picture. I hope they add some defensive talent in the off season, another stay home shot blocker like Gleason is needed. Also, I like Carlyle but he preaches defense first systems and there is nothing defensive about it. All im asking for is to avoid an embarrassment in the playoffs. Lets get in and anything can happen!"
840812,BillM,2014-03-12 05:41:00,17367,"2nd place in the Atlantic, how many games left in the season?  They must be doing something right.   If it was October I might agree with you, but they've proved even with being out shot (Which really means bunk when those shots are coming from the boards) that they've got a handle on things..."
840834,jedimaster,2014-03-12 13:45:00,3472,"I agree with 15 games remaining and in second place its time to give credit where credit is due. They allow alot of shots, and the defense isn't all that consistent. The forwards aren't great at playing team defense. However, the goal tending has made up for this and that goaltending has primarily been Bernier. This isn't a knock against Riemer. This isn't ignorance of the weknesses, but the team makeup and play has a whole has kept this team in games and winning more games than they have not. How many of you at the begining of the year would have said no to leafs in third in the east with 15 games left even if they allow alot of shots and reimer is number 2. When the goal tending is weak they get bombed like lastnight. When its strong they win and we are left wondering how. haha. I am very happy as a leafs fan right now."
840835,BillM,2014-03-12 13:48:00,17367,"I think the Anahiem game took a lot out of them, I don't think anyone really came to play lastnight.."

840850,grimsbylander,2014-03-12 15:07:00,3016,"I agree the Leafs are moving in the right direction but... I think we've set the bar too low given their previous years performances. Plus the fact they play in the east which is weaker this year than the west. Last nights game was a good indicator of what degree of improvement needs to happen before we're a serious contender for a trip to the big party. I'm not trying to be a party pooper, I'm thrilled with this years results, but if we BEAT the Sharks last night 6-2 we'd all be looking at this year's playoffs a little differently."
840851,BillM,2014-03-12 15:08:00,17367,"They played a hell of a game against Anaheim, I didn't think last nights performance was surprising at all...   Thursdays game against LA will be the one to watch."

It'll be good to see how they play against LA and then use that guide to see how they stack up against the other top teams in the league.  What I'm concerned about is the leafs consistency to give up leads in the third period. I am worried that we may be set for another heartbreak in the playoffs if this trend continues."
840890,davey buoy,2014-03-12 20:07:00,5505,"I'm concerned with the shots against on a almost regular basis.The defence and especially the forwards need to get back and help.Until that gets straightened out,we really rely too much on our goalies imo."

841125,danc,2014-03-14 01:54:00,4677,"Another tough one tonight, but I think that the Leafs can pull this one off if they're firing on all cylinders. They've had a day off and should be used to the time zone change by now. The first line has to pile up some points tonight and Bernier, playing against his old team mates, has to be solid. Looking forward to this one boys."

841131,kickingfrog,2014-03-14 02:49:00,8333,Like the retro Kings. Triple crown.
840685,pairofgreenhorns,2014-03-11 04:22:00,133,Speaking of Ranger is it possible it took him this long to get his game back? He's been playing amazing lately. Almost a different player. it is definitely possible as he missed a lot of games but he has really impressed me the last two games/
840686,pairofgreenhorns,2014-03-11 04:25:00,133,before tonight i would have been happy if toronto came away with 4 points on this road trip. if they play like they did in the first the next few games this might actually become a successful road trip!!!!!
840687,BillM,2014-03-11 04:26:00,17367,Ranger was a really good D man before he took his break from the NHL...   It definitely seems like he is getting back into form.

840713,jbailey,2014-03-11 14:58:00,866,"I was looking up where Kessel was in points and laughed when I saw Ovechkin wedged in between Getzlaf at 3rd and Perry at 5th, both of those guys with +28 and +26 ratings, while Ovie has an impressive -26 haha. Given +/- stats can be misleading, but at 67 points with a -26 is just terrible.. its like Lecavalier in 08', he had 92 points but was a -17.. defensive liabilities (although 32 of Ovie points came on the PP, which are not included, so at even strength - maybe a SHP or 2, 34 points and a -26... yuck)"

840770,SuperDave,2014-03-11 21:52:00,204,the first period was their best of the year. Outshooting the Ducks 11-9 and 2-0 on the scoreboard. Great game!

840797,kickingfrog,2014-03-12 01:34:00,8333,Nice seats!
840798,kickingfrog,2014-03-12 02:48:00,8333,Gardiner is the key guy on both goals. He's still a young defencemen.

840571,tb4me,2014-03-10 18:41:00,3295,Yea. Not from here. It seems that most people want him gone from the Leafs on dedicated Leafs message boards. Just got a little confused in my excitement I guess. lol Not me..I like Dion..Any guy that plays over 30 min a night is bound to have a few mistakes..It comes with 30 min games..Sure he has been  a tad soft at times but I dont know of any perfect Defense men in the NHL
840585,Squid,2014-03-10 19:23:00,1656,"Not me..I like Dion..Any guy that plays over 30 min a night is bound to have a few mistakes..It comes with 30 min games..Sure he has been  a tad soft at times but I dont know of any perfect Defense men in the NHL Oh he is far far from perfect. How about Dougherty, Seabrook, Keith, karllsen, Weber, etc should I go on?? Phanouck is so far down the list that he is stiing next to Komisarek!!"
840587,jbailey,2014-03-10 19:28:00,866,"Phaneuf averages 24mins a game, there are about 20 other D that clock more minutes. Suter is the only one who basically clocks 30mins on average."
840589,Acountdeleted,2014-03-10 19:33:00,2562,"If he clocks between 20-25 minutes a game he tends to have a pretty solid game. Of course he's not Doughty, Keith or Weber, but there are few of those. He's still probably top 30 defense in the league.   The worst part is Toronto loves chewing up and spitting out defensemen. Remember Matheau Schnider? Same thing happened."
840590,kickingfrog,2014-03-10 19:39:00,8333,"I'm not a big fan of Dion, and even less a fan of his contract, but he does log the most minutes (against the top forwards) on a team that doesn't play the most defensive focused game. His defensive partner for most of those minutes also contributes to the results."
840594,Acountdeleted,2014-03-10 20:17:00,2562,"I'm not a big fan of Dion, and even less a fan of his contract, but he does log the most minutes (against the top forwards) on a team that doesn't play the most defensive focused game.

840649,danc,2014-03-11 01:25:00,4677,Apparently he is alert and concious. The game has been postponed.
840662,tb4me,2014-03-11 02:25:00,3295,"Thats horrible..This has been a bad year for the NHL..Seizures, strokes and a heart attack."
840663,BillM,2014-03-11 02:35:00,17367,"Clarkson get hit with a high stick?  Great 5 on 5 pressure(By the 2nd and 3rd lines, lol)"

840668,tb4me,2014-03-11 02:55:00,3295,We got them right where we want them..Its ours to loose now..Lets go get more boys!Leafs tv sucks during the intermission breaks..
840671,danc,2014-03-11 03:07:00,4677," Wow, that period was a thing of beauty. Sure was Mike. You can't give Kessel or JVR half a step on you or they're gone!"
840672,solopaddler,2014-03-11 03:22:00,8605,2 fights by Clarkson? A goal by Ranger? unreal  They sure do seem to play better when they're physically engaged.
840674,BillM,2014-03-11 03:31:00,17367,Ranger has been playing extremely well these past few games.. How many blocked shots so far this game?  2 good ones that I've seen.
840675,solopaddler,2014-03-11 03:32:00,8605,Speaking of Ranger is it possible it took him this long to get his game back? He's been playing amazing lately. Almost a different player.
840677,solopaddler,2014-03-11 03:32:00,8605,"Bill, great minds think alike LOL!"
840678,solopaddler,2014-03-11 03:35:00,8605,On another note Corey Perry looks like the crypt keeper.
840681,tb4me,2014-03-11 03:45:00,3295,Paul Ranger has been unreal tonight..Dion you do know its ok to hit Perry when he has the puck eh bud? Good game so far
840683,tb4me,2014-03-11 03:56:00,3295,Wow Tyler Bozak Ranked 1st in NHL in shooting percentage..Scored 15th goal on only shot tonight..Oh and he has a 3 point night so far...
840684,pairofgreenhorns,2014-03-11 04:20:00,133,Wow Tyler Bozak Ranked 1st in NHL in shooting percentage..Scored 15th goal on only shot tonight..Oh and he has a 4 point night so far... a four point night on 3 goals? lol he is good
840391,leaf4,2014-03-09 02:27:00,2466,"weak bernier shoulda had that second one it didn't have too much speed, better put the pedal to the metal in the remaining half!"
840392,danc,2014-03-09 02:37:00,4677,It's a long game ahead yet Will. Been a Leafs fan for way too long to count on a two goal lead. Way to go Bernie. You jinxed us...
840394,leaf4,2014-03-09 02:41:00,2466,"sweet goal! now just need to buckle down and hold off the pressure, I'm liking how the leafs are finding ways to score in the final 10 mins of the game finally, beginning of the year a lot of games went to overtime and shootout because they couldn't bury a late one"
840395,leaf4,2014-03-09 02:49:00,2466,... why do they always make it harder on themselves lol
840396,kickingfrog,2014-03-09 02:56:00,8333,"Like the 2 points, but hate to give the single in the conference."
840398,tb4me,2014-03-09 03:08:00,3295,"Like the 2 points, but hate to give the single in the conference. I was thinking the same thing..Oh well I thought it was well played game..You have to give Philly some credit..They played an exellent game but most of it was from behind. An odd stat about the leafs...Leafs give up 33  third period leads but are now 24-1 and 2 when leading after 2.. I thought Dion played a noteworthy game..Held off Giroux, Lead the team in ice time and sets up the OT winner.. Good Game boys Go Leafs Go!!!"

840403,grizzlybri,2014-03-09 03:23:00,565,Wow was that last goal ever nice.  What have I been telling you Jeremy about Lupul for years now.  Also anyone else nervous when the leafs had the Power play tonight
840408,Acountdeleted,2014-03-09 03:56:00,2562," What have I been telling you Jeremy about Lupul for years now.  Also anyone else nervous when the leafs had the Power play tonight  Something about 'quack quack quack'  The entire game the commentators were talking about how important it is now because the leafs are 3 points up on Philly. I just realized it would never matter thanks to these new squirelly ranking systems and playoff format.  Ps- If y'all don't know what the new playoff format is now, you're going to be real angry in a few months."
840410,DRIFTER_016,2014-03-09 04:28:00,10439,I was at the Lightning/Bruins game in Tampa tonight. T'was a good one and went to the shoot out. Here's the first of my shots taken at the game. I had pretty decent seats.  
840420,leaf4,2014-03-09 12:09:00,2466,"That final goal was a beaut, great team effort on it and what a clean passing play from Gunnar to Phaneuf to Lupes!"
840423,glen,2014-03-09 12:36:00,2641,Entertaining game.  I guess that's what matters. Bodie is better then clarkson. Lol.
840426,kickingfrog,2014-03-09 12:56:00,8333," Something about 'quack quack quack'  The entire game the commentators were talking about how important it is now because the leafs are 3 points up on Philly. I just realized it would never matter thanks to these new squirelly ranking systems and playoff format.  Ps- If y'all don't know what the new playoff format is now, you're going to be real angry in a few months.  It's quite possible the team with the 7th best record (not the 7th seed) in the conference will have the easiest 1st round match-up. And depending on how the first round goes the 2nd round could also be messed-up.  I hope they revamp this system in the summer, but considering that would require an admittance of their own mistakes and the slightest indication of intelligence from the owners/league I won't be holding my breath.  The point to Philly could matter if the Leafs and Philly end up in the wildcard positions or meet in the semifinals."
840441,tb4me,2014-03-09 15:49:00,3295,I thought that Dion sucks? Say what? I thought you had a man crush on Dion..Where did this come from?
840442,Acountdeleted,2014-03-09 16:01:00,2562,"So, I'm still not 100% on this but the conference champ plays the second wildcard spot, the other division winner plays the first wildcard spot. 2 and 3 from each division play.  Then I think, if the 1 seed in both divisions win they play the winner of 2 vs 3 in their own division, BUT if the wildcard wins then the team with the highest points plays them. What a headache. And what a nightmare if you are in the Anaheim, San Jose, LA division.  I do not think this has the best teams playing in the conference final. I don't know why they can't just keep it simple."
840444,BillM,2014-03-09 16:16:00,17367,"How can you screw up such a simple thing as first plays, last, etc etc?  lol.   Just leave damn well alone!"
840450,kickingfrog,2014-03-09 16:44:00,8333,"Top 3 teams in each of the new 4 divisions get in the play-offs. The next top 2 teams in each conference get in. They are called the wildcard teams. The division winner with the most points plays the wildcard team with the least points. The other division winner plays the other wildcard team. The 2nd and 3rd place teams in each division play each other (in their own division).  The 2nd round will still be within the division. If a wildcard team beats a division winner that wildcard team will ""stay"" in that division for the second round even if they are from the other division. In the fanfare of the new re-ilinement and play-off format the league was very quite about this part.  Based on today's standings and just for a reference:  Eastern Conference  Atlantic Division Bos 87 Mon 77 Tor 76  Metro Pit 88 Phi 73 Nyr 72  Wildcard TB 74 Det 71  First round Pit v Det Phi v Nyr  Bos v Tb Mon v Tor  If Detroit beats Pittsburg, Detroit will play the winner of Philly/NYR. "
840453,kickingfrog,2014-03-09 16:53:00,8333,"How can you screw up such a simple thing as first plays, last, etc etc?  lol.   Just leave damn well alone!  That's easy. Bettmen isn't about competition. He's about artificial parity. Three point games, unbalanced schedules and the play-off system all contribute to this."
840456,Acountdeleted,2014-03-09 17:04:00,2562,And with the old format it SHOULD be:  Still Pitt vs Detroit and Boston vs TB  But then it should be Montreal vs the rangers and Leafs vs philly.  Ugh what a mess.
840473,DRIFTER_016,2014-03-09 21:05:00,10439,Some more shots from last nights Bruins/Lightning game.

839879,leaf4,2014-03-05 19:32:00,2466,off to Dallas for Tiny tim ! Would be nice if there was a quality d man available for the leafs to scoop
839881,Brettiop,2014-03-05 19:40:00,279,Wow this is the first year in awhile where the leafs haven't been rumored to be in on EVERYONE available...
839883,manitoubass2,2014-03-05 19:55:00,11391,Whoa! Gaborik to LA???
839884,Brettiop,2014-03-05 20:02:00,279,And Moulson to Minny....  Where is Vanek going to Go?     wings or Chicago my guess....
839885,grimsbylander,2014-03-05 20:02:00,3016,"Thanks KF. Can't wait to get home, kick back and get caught up on the action.  BTW, have the Leafs announced the roster for tonight? Anyone sitting? Hmmm"
839886,Brettiop,2014-03-05 20:27:00,279,Vanek to MTL.....damn  apparently for only a 2nd rounder and a mid level prospect? Yikes thats cheap...
839888,kickingfrog,2014-03-05 20:31:00,8333,For a over rated player who doesn't put up a point a game? He fits in perfectly.

839890,manitoubass2,2014-03-05 20:32:00,11391,Nonis says there was a lot if interest in Reilly. Glad we kept him
839893,Brettiop,2014-03-05 20:48:00,279," Not for a UFA.  Even for a UFA its pretty cheap  They traded Moulson and a 1st for Vanek, then turn around and trade Vanek for a 2nd and a prospect...  Garth snow should be fired...."
839896,jbailey,2014-03-05 20:57:00,866,"yes Garth snow should be fired, that's disgusting.."
839898,jbailey,2014-03-05 21:03:00,866,"For a over rated player who doesn't put up a point a game? He fits in perfectly. Vanek is definitely over rated. I guess you're referring to Subban and Price? The way everyone hates on them in TO its hard to understand how they are considered over rated. Sounds more like a bias opinion of a lengthy rivalry. (Don't get me wrong, I don't think they're God's gift to hockey, but they're not awful by any stretch)  and as my duty to partake in the rivalry, I will post this link as a reminder... http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/multimedia/photo_gallery/1201/nhl.players.poll.most.overrated/content.1.html  "
839907,lookinforwalleye,2014-03-05 21:42:00,4399,Well I think I will chime in on the Vanek to MTL deal  sitting here on my ocean front balcony in Greneda sippin on a ice cold Caribe!!!  Well as Rob so astutely pointed out he is not a point a game player but how many NHL players these days put up a point a game. He is having a decent season considering he has played with two crap teams and he has more points than the magician JVR!!!  Montreal needed a goal scorer and they went out and got one!!!  Gotta go now and grab another Caribe and watch the sunset!!!  Gord signing off from sunny Greneda!!!
839912,jedimaster,2014-03-05 21:53:00,3472,"I am no mathematician but I would take JVR with his 4.25 mil per year and 52 points over Vanek and his what 7.1 mil per year and 53 points.... Just saying.... However, Vanek isn't a bum. He is a good player, and MTL needs anyone that can score. Even if they have to pay them 3 times what they are worth."
839915,Brettiop,2014-03-05 22:01:00,279,"Come on Jedi Master, gotta give Vanek some credit...this is the only year(and maybe last i guess) that JVR has been half the player Vanek has been...."

839926,kickingfrog,2014-03-05 22:21:00,8333,I was wrong Vanek. He isn't that good of a fit. Word is it will take 5-7 days for Montreal to get a jersey big enough to fit him.

839948,lookinforwalleye,2014-03-05 23:33:00,4399,Ya was kinda hoping the habs would have forgotten about Vanek and went after Clarkson and his 4 goals!!!!
839959,Jigger,2014-03-06 00:24:00,1237,He left money on the table in Edm. Was thinking an offer from the Leafs would seem a bargain to Craig Mac...
839960,BillM,2014-03-06 00:25:00,17367,Does the ice look like it just went through a nuclear event for anyone else on the feed from Sportsnet?  Holy bright batman!!!!
839772,tb4me,2014-03-05 06:09:00,3295,Being on IR doesn't automatically give cap releif. It has to be long term and the team has to request for the relief from the league. I don't think the Leaf's asked/received cap relief for Bolland. My mistake cause your right..But I thought they did because he was on long term IR..
839773,jbailey,2014-03-05 06:46:00,866,...anyone?
839788,Steve,2014-03-05 12:49:00,2075,"Bill, ""bring back Komorov"".  You Aren't Joking!!!(yes, I'm biased being a FInn, but BRING BACK KOMOROV!!!)  Sign him for a couple years and I'll finally have a name to put on the back of my jersey"
839791,grimsbylander,2014-03-05 12:58:00,3016,"Bolland was and still may be on long-term injury reserve. If he's off, it happened only in the last couple days. The Leafs must have applied for cap relief knowing he'd be out long term plus they just put McLaren on waivers to free up cap space for Bolland. If the Leafs aren't willing to sign Bolland to a 5-7 year contract at about 5mil per year, good chance he gets traded today. He's UFA this season."
839796,BillM,2014-03-05 13:16:00,17367,"Bill, ""bring back Komorov"".  You Aren't Joking!!!  (yes, I'm biased being a FInn, but BRING BACK KOMOROV!!!)  Sign him for a couple years and I'll finally have a name to put on the back of my jersey   Steve, that guy was just awesome..  Hard hitting, great in the corners, definitely had the dmen looking over their shoulder when he was on the ice.  and he was cheap.  A little more grit upfront can never hurt."
839815,kickingfrog,2014-03-05 14:40:00,8333,"Found some info on Long term IR. Still don't know if Bolland is or isn't.  http://www.capgeek.com/faq/how-does-long-term-injured-reserve-LTIR-work   Can't see trading Bolland. He's been, and still is hurt, and he's a UFA. That can't be that much trade value versus his potential use in the play-offs."
839825,grimsbylander,2014-03-05 15:29:00,3016,"The Leafs are in a stuff spot with Bolland. Yes his trade value has dropped but without a long-term deal, he walks after the season. That is worse than lessened trade value. A deal involving guaranteed medical conditions is not unheard of. I hope he stays, but are the Leafs willing to go long term? He would probably qualify (I'd have to check) for a NT clause somewhere during his next contract as well. His injury has complicated the deal."
839827,kickingfrog,2014-03-05 15:37:00,8333,Bolland is still not ready to go tonight.
839830,BillM,2014-03-05 16:06:00,17367,"The thing with Bolland though is no one wants him when he's hurt and he can't ask for the big bucks with the season he's had.  We all know how he plays, I think the Leafs would be stupid to even consider getting rid of him."
839835,BillM,2014-03-05 16:23:00,17367,St.Louis is now a Ranger!  Callahan and a 1st/2nd round pick are on their way to Tampa.
839836,kickingfrog,2014-03-05 16:25:00,8333,Dumb move by Marty.
839838,BillM,2014-03-05 16:27:00,17367,Dumb move by Marty.  Was he that pissed at Yzerman?
839839,kickingfrog,2014-03-05 16:35:00,8333,Given his career in Tampa this makes him look like a 7 year old who's mother didn't buy him some candy while at the grocery store.  He will not find the net in NY the way he did in Tampa and after his career is over he will look back on this as an awful move.  Yzerman did well considering the circumstances.
839842,Steve,2014-03-05 16:43:00,2075,"you know, i agree with the assessment of St. Louis being dumb...  but....  players want to play for team Canada.  he was snubbed.  so off he went.  i agree Yzerman did well...considering...."
839847,Thrilla,2014-03-05 16:55:00,164,"I heard a report he wanted to be closer to his summer home in Conneticuit , don't see how it is dumb on Marty's part , he got what he wanted ?"

839850,kickingfrog,2014-03-05 17:19:00,8333,The points (and wins) won't come in NY the way they did in Tampa. He had a tantrum when he didn't get named to the Olympic team. He was the captain of his team.
839851,jedimaster,2014-03-05 17:19:00,3472,Wow Tampa got a great return on st.luois. Apparently henskey to the sens
839852,jedimaster,2014-03-05 17:22:00,3472,"Tampa isn't a cup contender this or next year, and even if calahan walks, to get a first and second(could be a first if the Rangers make the eastern finals) is great for the bolts imo."
839853,Brettiop,2014-03-05 17:25:00,279,"Yupp, fantastic deal for the bolts....  Marty likely to play with Brad Richards again, now they just need Vinny and it'll be 2004 cup winning dream line back together"

839618,jbailey,2014-03-04 06:40:00,866,I thought Kimmel was rather gentle considering how it could have went. I can only imagine how different it would have been had he went on John Stewart haha.  (I was being sarcastic about Toronto's great mayor by the way..   )
839716,jedimaster,2014-03-04 23:07:00,3472,Wow luongo traded to Florida for markstrom and matthias

839721,kickingfrog,2014-03-04 23:20:00,8333,Tort's scorched earth demeanour is wearing thin even faster in Vancouver then it did in NY or Tampa.

839730,Steve,2014-03-04 23:48:00,2075,"likely not even have to add the pick.  if kesler wants out, and kadri being overrated, i'd say you might get away with kadri and reims for kesler."
839731,davey buoy,2014-03-04 23:48:00,5505,"How about. Kesler for say a kadri, Reimer and a pick? I say forget about Kessler and trade Kuleman for a good defenceman ."
839733,kickingfrog,2014-03-04 23:55:00,8333,"Despite the trade, and the Canucks paying 15% of his salary they could still get hit with penalties if he retires before the end of his deal.  He turns 35 in a month and has 8 more years on his deal.  If Luongo retires in 2016 the Canucks pay over $1.42 million for 6 years, Panthers $508K for 6 years.  2017 Van $1.7 mill and Fla $886K for 5 years.  It continues until 2020 at $4.26 mill X2 years for Van and $73 thousand X2 for Fla  And finally in 2021 $8.52 mill for Van and zero for Fla.  Bobby Lou was right last trade deadline day. "
839742,jedimaster,2014-03-05 00:54:00,3472,Kessler in the ice for 20 minutes adds a lot of defense versus what they will need to give up. I think kulleman will need to go to make space. Who knows. It will be interesting to see if Nono makes any moves.
839743,kickingfrog,2014-03-05 01:06:00,8333,Kesler doesn't want to play in Canada.
839745,BillM,2014-03-05 01:08:00,17367,I don't think Toronto is going to make any big deals.   For what they need (another good dman) they'll need to give up too much.   They already put McLaren on waivers in order to get some space to sign Bolland.  I like Kuli but you don't get anything for him...   Bring back Komorov!  LOL!!!
839747,kickingfrog,2014-03-05 01:11:00,8333,"If Bolland re-signs, that doesn't impact this year's cap."

839759,tb4me,2014-03-05 02:05:00,3295, I thought it did?  Even better then. He is on IR right now but when he returns his cap hit is in effect.

839503,leaf4,2014-03-03 20:04:00,2466,Fraser Mclaren on waivers I wonder what they're up to?
839504,BillM,2014-03-03 20:05:00,17367,"It was either McLaren or Orr.  With Bodie in the line up, they don't need 3 tough guys."
839507,muddler,2014-03-03 20:15:00,623,"Lemme see.  Defense is a 5 man effort. Anybody can play defense. My local ex-Bruin , Al Secord proved that. Don Cherry said , ""the nose picker at the blue line"" or as the Laffs fans call them , ""skill players"" don't check or do anything but skate around and wait for the other 4 players to get them the puck so that they can wow the fans with their scoring skills. And you wonder why the the Loafs get out shot, easy? They are short handed all the time in their own end with their skill players out there. Look at the Canadian Olympic team. super stars like Cosby played both ways. Yup we didn't have anyone win the scoring race but who got the gold? I have a ton of respect for Cosby now after what he did in Sochi. Lead by example not stats.  Watch just 81. loafing around the blue line hoping to stick check a pass to the defense so he can wow them all with skating and shooting. Watch that same player in the offensive zone when the opposing team gets the puck back as he lazily skates up the ice. ""one dimensional"" is a phrase used often to describe this. Light a fire under some of these Laffs players and have them back check and work with the defense and the shots on goal will equalize. The wins will increase.  ""The little ball of H3LL"" aka Brad Marchand is a typical grind it out player and he scores too. He'll win ya a bunch of games on sheer defensive effort. That's why I've been a Bruins fan for well over 55 years. If you don't play defensive hockey when the other team has the puck, the organization will get rid of you (PK) and sent you to Toronto.  Keep looking for a better d-man. As long as the skill players loaf around the blue line waiting for the other 4 teammates to get him the puck, the Laffs ain't going nowhere.  It won't matter who the Laffs get until everybody plays both ways.  muddler"
839510,kickingfrog,2014-03-03 20:28:00,8333,You're right. Anybody can play defence. Only a few talented players can produce points. And even less of them have class.
839512,BillM,2014-03-03 20:32:00,17367,lol @ using Marchand as an example of anything (accept for words we aren't allowed to use here)

Your coaching staff should really tell Bernier to stay in the net and try and stop the puck he has a slightly better chance of stopping the puck when he is in the crease, as you well know as soon as he leaves  the crease strange and bad things  seem to happen!!!

You've misinterpreted my tone and can put the glasses elsewhere.  Just pointing out how unusual the 2 plays were.  Can someone reference the last time an NHL ref took that long to blow a whistle when a puck is under a goalie and not visible? BTW I am for the refs taking longer to blow the whistle on those types of plays but they never do.  Last time a goalie received a penalty for freezing the puck out of the crease? Refs ""managing"" the game will sometimes warn a goalie that they could get a penalty and maybe if it happens again in the game a penalty will be given but those are very rare and I've never seen it in overtime.  I'm sure in all the games you've watched you must have seen both calls numerous times."

We can`t have goalies skating out to the face off dot and flopping on the puck now can we just like can`t have players putting their hand on the puck in the crease.  Anyhoo the Habs won the Leafs lost...deal with it!!!  I am done with this I am off to Grenada for a week to warm up, you guys play nice while I am gone!!!"

838713,BassMan11,2014-02-27 13:25:00,583,Tough one on Clarkson... when you are playing on the 3rd line with no PP time it will be tough to earn 5 million any way you look at it.

That also makes him good trade bait except that he is a ufa again this summer, he will ask for (and will get) more money and term. If the Leafs don't see him fitting in at the money he'll get then they may trade him for picks or depth.  Clarkson is a solid player (at least before this season) but he got more term and maybe a little too much money. At this point the Leafs have to sit on his contract and hope he starts to turn it around and play to his role instead of his pay-scale."

835348,davey buoy,2014-02-08 23:53:00,5505,Let's hope that late goal doesn't take the wind out of their sails .
835349,leaf4,2014-02-08 23:53:00,2466,.... bernier really!?!? what in the hell kind of a goal was that?
835350,jedimaster,2014-02-08 23:55:00,3472,Deflected in front halfway to the net off the shin pad. But he should have had that one. He was sleeping and didn't adjust to the deflection. Bad goal.
835357,leaf4,2014-02-09 00:25:00,2466,"this game needs a fight to add a little spice to it, kinda quiet"
835368,danc,2014-02-09 01:53:00,4677,What a snoozer. But we'll take it.
835372,tb4me,2014-02-09 02:11:00,3295,"I thought it was a good game..Except for the 1st, that was slow n boring. Kessel and JVR are awesome together and combined with Bozak they are the #1 line in the league right now..I thought Raymond and Clarkson both played good gamesGo Leafs Go!Time to watch some Olympic hockey. Does team USA split up the pair of JVR and Kessel?Go Canada Go!!!"
835373,kickingfrog,2014-02-09 02:12:00,8333,Hope Phil and JVR's puckluck disappears for a couple of weeks.
835375,jedimaster,2014-02-09 02:19:00,3472,Haha. Its a good time for a couple Leafs to have a dry spell.

835556,kickingfrog,2014-02-10 18:44:00,8333,"At today's practice these were the forward lines:  Kunitz-Crosby-Carter Sharp-Toews-Nash Marleau-Getzlaf-Perry Benn-Tavares-Bergeron  St. Louis/Duchene rotate.

Here's your explanation KF.  http://www.thestar.com/life/2014/02/07/why_did_26yearold_pittsburgh_penguin_kris_letang_have_a_stroke.html   Everyone is born with a hole in their heart, which resembles a flap-like opening in the wall that divides the right and left atrium. It typically seals completely during infancy, but for about 25 per cent of people, that opening never completely closes. Normally, blood enters the heart’s right side and gets pumped to the lungs, where little micro blood clots get filtered. The blood then returns to the heart’s left side and is pumped out to the body. However, if there’s an opening in the wall, blood can flow from the right to the left side, meaning those bits of blood clots don’t get filtered by the lungs. Instead, they get pumped out into the arteries that take blood to the brain. If a clot cuts off normal blood flow to the brain it results in a stroke.  There's a lot more info in the article."

Mason Raymond and ya , Clarkson really stood out to me tonight..Were 2 ahead of the Habs and 1 behind Tampa for 3rd..Id like to go into the break in 3 rd place but that means we have to beat Vancouver Sat night..They have always been a pain in the but for the Leafs..Go for the win boys!Go Leafs Go!!!"

835136,BillM,2014-02-07 19:38:00,17367,Anyone else hear about Letang having a stroke? Out a min of 6 weeks.  26 years old one of the best in the league... I hope he fully recovers and is back on the ice in no time.
835137,kickingfrog,2014-02-07 19:43:00,8333,Just not the type of news you expect to hear about a pro athlete in the prime of his life.
835138,BillM,2014-02-07 19:46:00,17367,"Yeah, it's crazy.. Apparently he's had a small hole in his heart this entire time.."
835139,kickingfrog,2014-02-07 19:49:00,8333,"Strokes are a blockage in the brian, how is the hole in the heart related?"
835144,DRIFTER_016,2014-02-07 20:22:00,10439,My guess is the hole in the heart issue threw a clot that ended up in his brain causing the stroke.
835145,BillM,2014-02-07 20:23:00,17367,"Strokes are a blockage in the brian, how is the hole in the heart related?  No idea, just repeating what I read."
835147,tb4me,2014-02-07 20:46:00,3295,Id be surprised to see him back this year at all let alone 5 to 6 weeks..The stroke has effected his speech and he is constantly dizzy. They wont know the extent of the damage done for weeks yet..Sure is a crappy deal for him..
835154,kickingfrog,2014-02-07 21:12:00,8333,My guess is the hole in the heart issue threw a clot that ended up in his brain causing the stroke. Clearly I'm not a MD but that's not how these things usually work?

If thats not true, many things can cause a stroke. I dont wanna get into it, but i feel for him (his family) and thats horrible news"
835224,kickingfrog,2014-02-08 01:45:00,8333,Apparently the Fan590 has Kadri's dad on the radio tonight discussing the did he/didn't he thing.
835236,danc,2014-02-08 02:46:00,4677,"Minor strokes (which this was) are pretty common. I know at least 5 people that have had them in the past 5 years, including my life partner. All is well now with all of them."
835321,kickingfrog,2014-02-08 20:24:00,8333,Heads up. HNIC has the Leaf's game starting at 6pm tonight. It would be nice to have another win before the break.  
835323,irishfield,2014-02-08 20:44:00,26272,That their new forward Rob... if so they might win tonight!
835324,kickingfrog,2014-02-08 20:50:00,8333,That their new forward Rob... if so they might win tonight!  Ya if I could keep her from trying to pick-up and eat the puck.

834870,kickingfrog,2014-02-06 16:26:00,8333,St. Louis it is. I wouldn't want Giroux anywhere near any team anytime.
834871,BillM,2014-02-06 16:27:00,17367,Let's hope St.Louis brings it!
834881,tb4me,2014-02-06 17:26:00,3295,Good call Team Canada..Like I said yesterday there is no Canadian thats playing better right now..
834882,tb4me,2014-02-06 17:32:00,3295,"Ok I stand corrected..Yikes!Did You Know: Since the Olympic team was announced, the Canadian forward with the most points is Nazem Kadri (18). Claude Giroux is in 2nd (17)."
834889,BillM,2014-02-06 18:18:00,17367,They couldn't make a bad choice picking St.Louis or Giroux if you ask me.
834897,tb4me,2014-02-06 19:27:00,3295,"They couldn't make a bad choice picking St.Louis or Giroux if you ask me. I agree..Leafs play Tampa tonight, imagine St Louis gets hurt and Naz gets the nod for team Canada....just sayin..lol"
834910,kickingfrog,2014-02-06 20:40:00,8333,"Kadri's points started to come when Bozak came back no?  Kadri is young, and still hasn't played a full season in the NHL. He will get better, and more complete, but I'm not sure he'll ever be seriously considered for an Olympic team but we'll see in about 3 and half years."
834913,davey buoy,2014-02-06 20:50:00,5505,"So what I heard was right,glad they picked him.It really was a no brainer .The hockey panels have been talking ever since the roster was picked.As you all know,he should of been picked at the beginning in my opinion.Go Canada Go!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

834926,kickingfrog,2014-02-06 21:34:00,8333,I have a feeling Zdeno Chara might be even more ornery then normal during the Olympics.

834957,leaf4,2014-02-07 00:39:00,2466,yep! kadris dad still not sporting a jersey so let's get that out of the way haha
834958,tb4me,2014-02-07 00:39:00,3295,Guess it's only on Leaf's TV? Yes you would be correct..As annoying as it is to have to pay an extra 10 bux a month for one channel..
834959,misfish,2014-02-07 00:40:00,29133,Well thats were Im watching it bud.

Giveing the dads jersey anyone with $300 can buy is lame to being with. Give the dads exclusive jackets or something similar, not the same jerseys fanboys wear."

I'm not sure but here is TSN's report on it http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/story/?id=443088, Most people are going to say St Louis, I think it will be him myself and i think he has earned the right to be there.

834794,kickingfrog,2014-02-06 02:20:00,8333,Giroux??? Canada wants to win this don't they?  Final roster doesn't have to be named until just before first game but apparently the player will be named by Friday night.
834795,BillM,2014-02-06 02:22:00,17367,Giroux or  St.Louis would be a great choice.
834540,kickingfrog,2014-02-05 00:22:00,8333,"Under the best circumstances Clarkson was going to have a tough time living up to that contract in his home town. The Leafs didn't expect him to score 35 goals a season but he hasn't even been doing enough of the character stuff. Maybe he turns it around after the break, but if he doesn't it might be a long summer of sports talk radio."
834547,kickingfrog,2014-02-05 00:39:00,8333,Interesting note on the trade freeze during the Olympics as mentioned on tonight's broadcast. The players still get paid during the break so some teams might not be willing to finalize a deal before the break when they'd have to pay a player while they're not playing.
834550,Steve,2014-02-05 00:53:00,2075,I personally don't believe half the teams in the NHL would take Clarkson at his current salary.  who knows though.  I just hope he steps up his play.
834553,tb4me,2014-02-05 00:55:00,3295,They also mentioned the Sens are still hemorrhaging money and need to do something quick to right the ship..Id start by getting rid of their GM
834556,kickingfrog,2014-02-05 01:11:00,8333,… Or getting more home games against the Leafs.

834558,glen,2014-02-05 01:20:00,2641,Agreed.  Let talent lead the rush.
834559,jedimaster,2014-02-05 01:22:00,3472,Not a good first period. Let's hope Carlisle puts his foot down hard in the intermission. 19-4 out shot is not a good start. Bernier is playing great though. Knock on wood.

Why is it your such a sore looser..Sore winner too im sure but we will never find out as long as your a Sens fan..  Incidental or even accidental contact leading to injury or potential injury I can deal with. Hitting a player who is vulnerable and unprepared is cowardly. I think the refs and the NHL got this one wrong, especially if they want to see this kind of hit out of the NHL. It has little to do with the outcome of the game, the Sens didn't match the intensity of the laffs and the scoreboard showed that. And that is why the laffs are ahead of us in the standings. Having been a laff fan for the better part of 20 years and watched them suck so bad I can honestly say it's about time they had some success. I'm sure the long awaited fans who also went through the 48 years of sucking and no playoffs for 11 years are thrilled at the play of late. That doesn't mean I dislike them any less.  Laffs still suck IMO and if they do make the playoffs I hope its a sweep in the first round and they are gone so I can rub that in too.  Remember the collapse against the Bruins?    Epic"

At the Colts games there is a restaurant section (Seats in the open part of the arena that have a server taking food orders). I paid slightly more for a burger and onion rings then I did for a hot (sliced off the roast as you order) roast beef sandwich and kettle chips at the Leafs game.

832286,Dan668,2014-01-24 01:23:00,1120,Thank you franson. Yet another giveaway
832291,danc,2014-01-24 01:43:00,4677,"Conner Brown. Good read for Leafs fans.   Everything is coming up aces for the Toronto Maple Leafs in January.  The club has won six straight games to not just climb back into the playoff race but establish a secure foothold.  And if the riches weren’t embarrassing enough, the Leafs also have junior hockey’s hottest scorer, Connor Brown.  Brown, the 156th selection in the 2012 NHL Entry Draft currently leads the Ontario Hockey League in scoring with 31 goals, 61 assists for 92 points in 45 games this season.  He holds a 10-point lead over his closest competitor (teammate Dane Fox) and is on pace to challenge the 140-point mark in the OHL for the first time since Patrick Kane in 2007.  Since the OHL season began in October, Brown has gone from being a longshot prospect (ranked 21st by PPP and 18th by TLN in the 2013 offseason) to the club’s brightest draft pick.  His play so far this season earned him a three-year entry level contract; and his omission from Canada’s WJC team came as a shocker to anyone who understands that winning teams tend to outscore losing teams.  While interning at the Hockey News in the spring of 2012, Brown’s name first came to my attention while working on their draft preview issue.  While playing on a comically bad Erie Otters team, Brown racked up one of the worst +/- scores of any player in any league ever with a -72. Indeed, if I recall correctly, he was something of a laughing stock among the staff.  Never mind that +/- is a mostly pointless stat; Brown was one of the few good players on a team that literally gave up twice as many goals as they scored (169 GF vs. 338 GA, a hilarious -169 differential).  Lost in the negative zone was that Brown led those woeful Otters in scoring in 2012.  And repeated that feat in 2013.  And seems hell bent to lead the whole league for the three-peat.  Heck of an encore after being written off so completely.  Despite making headlines for the wrong reasons prior to his draft, the Leafs certainly have had a precise plan in place to see Brown develop into a top six guy in the NHL.  In a July 2013 interview, Leafs Player Development head Jim Hughes said this about Brown:  He’s an interesting one because his skill sets are so high.  He can find the late people, he can find the seam, he can find the backdoor people and he can buy time and space. He’s got really soft hands and a very creative brain.  And then you put him with McDavid for another year. I think Connor finished around 80 points in the OHL?  So, when you play him with McDavid he should be in the 100-point range.  Maybe we keep in junior for an overage year.  Maybe he’ll be in the 110-120 point range. We’re not sure.  He’s got a high ceiling and we’re going to continue to find out how far he can take this, because he’s a second line player, not a 3 guy or a 4 guy.  He’s a 2 guy.  And we’ll see what kind of production he can put up this coming season. With Connor we’re looking 24 months down the road.  It’s not a quick fix with him.  We’re looking to put 6-8 pounds on him this year, maybe another 6-8 pounds on him next year.  We’re looking long term and if we allow him that big window of another 24 months we might have something.  It’s safe to say that Brown has exceeded everybody’s expectations for him, even if a 100-point season did seem insane (instead of prophetic) at the time.  Clearly the biggest goals from the Maple Leafs’ standpoint are to see Brown add to both his point totals and his waistline.  But having nearly superseded his projected point totals in his draft +2 year with 23 games remaining, it’s safe to say Brown is ahead of the Leafs’ internal schedule.  He’ll almost certainly start with the Marlies for the 2014-15 season, as his offensive pedigree will be a welcome addition to Spott’s roster.  But will he be an NHLer? Or is he is merely an exceptional OHLer? I took a quick peak at the last 20 years of OHL leading scorers, their ages, draft status, points and games played:....  (EDITED IN LENGTH)"
832292,leaf4,2014-01-24 01:48:00,2466,sounds like a step in the right direction for drafting talent rather than trading for it!

They have been travelling on the west coast playing a few hours out of their time zone, and sleeping whenever they can between flights. This is their third game in four nights dealing with this.

831931,tb4me,2014-01-21 23:59:00,3295,"Franson -12 Phanuef +12 Why is that? its really just because of lines and defensive combos..How many kids has Dion had to work with , not many..Franny gets a new partner or line just about every game."
831932,kickingfrog,2014-01-22 00:01:00,8333,"Plus/minus can be a very deceiving stat. It doesn't factor for quality of opposition, quality of your own line-mates or the role of a player.  That isn't meant as a defence (or criticism) of Franson or anyone else. Just something to be considered.    On another note, if a player is so awful why bother trading them? You would only get a near equally awful player in return,"
831941,solopaddler,2014-01-22 00:33:00,8605,"    On another note, if a player is so awful why bother trading them? You would only get a near equally awful player in return,   Addition by subtraction.  Don't know what games the Franson lovers have been watching but the guy is brutal, easily leads the d-core in bone headed plays.  At least earlier in the season when Ranger was being thrashed it was clear he at least had some hockey IQ, but his footspeed was lacking.  No excuse for Franson.  His breakout passes are scary. He'll stand there like a statue behind his net then 9 out of ten times slap a super long pass through a maze of players, most times giving the puck away.  He's big, but as soft as butter.  When pressured in his own end he almost always fires the puck blindly around the boards where it's intercepted.  I could go on.  The kid has a blazing slapshot from the point, easily the best on the team, but that's it.  I'd prefer my defensemen actual defend once in a while, especially when we already have Reilly and Gardiner.  I want him gone, can't stand him. I'd rather see one of the Marlie kids play instead."
831960,kickingfrog,2014-01-22 01:36:00,8333,Great. He's a pylon. Leafs trade him for another pylon. No net gain.
831964,tb4me,2014-01-22 02:00:00,3295,Finally game time..Yikes I hate late starts..GO LEAFS GO!!!
831966,tb4me,2014-01-22 02:16:00,3295,Wow Kessel it doesn't get any easier then that goal...lol

831971,DRIFTER_016,2014-01-22 02:55:00,10439,Even Franson is doing things right tonight.
831973,leaf4,2014-01-22 02:58:00,2466,a delightful change of pace for him! though there's still 40 mins to be played don't hold your breath lol
831974,BillM,2014-01-22 03:00:00,17367,Don't jinx anything! LOL!  It's almost like Carlyle is embracing a bit of the rushing game that the Leafs are known for.
831976,leaf4,2014-01-22 03:12:00,2466,KESSSSEEELLLLLLL
831978,tb4me,2014-01-22 03:18:00,3295,Well this is a one way game here..The Leafs puck pressure is unreal..4-0 midway thru the second..
831979,tb4me,2014-01-22 03:19:00,3295,Oh BTW Kessel just passed Crosby in goals scored..Wouldn't it be nice if he could pot 40 this year?

831351,Pikeslayer,2014-01-19 03:11:00,1443,Big assist from PK for staying on the ice for the last 2+ minutes and contributing to Lupe's goal

831749,tb4me,2014-01-21 03:50:00,3295,"We win ,but what a boring game..Bernie solid and im happy he didn't let in his trademark softie tonight"
831752,danc,2014-01-21 03:57:00,4677,They got a little too cute there in the third. Guys were trying to score from their own blue line with the empty net. But we'll take the W. Just need one win in the next three games to earn the token split on the road.
831254,Steve,2014-01-18 22:19:00,2075,well....bernie is starting in net tonight.....for the good guys.
831255,Steve,2014-01-18 22:20:00,2075,AND clarkson isn't playing....our record is substantially better when that bum is sitting out.

831293,tb4me,2014-01-19 00:24:00,3295,What what hits early in the game by Toronto. Franny scores and were up 1-0...Keep pounding these habs boys!
831294,kickingfrog,2014-01-19 00:24:00,8333,Who is that guy and where's he been for most of this year?
831296,davey buoy,2014-01-19 00:27:00,5505,Was good to see Kadri with a little dipsy do for the assist
831299,BillM,2014-01-19 00:38:00,17367,I think Glenn Healy smoked about 300lbs of crack tonight before the game.  I haven't heard him sound this stupid in a while.   I'd take McGuire over him any day of the week (And I really don't like McGuire!)  Did he really just call Subban the best defenseman in the league?
831312,tb4me,2014-01-19 01:35:00,3295,Kessel..What a steal by Holland on Subban. Man Holland looks good
831316,DRIFTER_016,2014-01-19 01:43:00,10439,RAYMOND!!!!!!

831320,Dan668,2014-01-19 01:54:00,1120,"Idiot. Better not resign that joke. Like really, 12 seconds left too."
831329,Dan668,2014-01-19 02:27:00,1120,Pretty crappy goals by the habs. No luck for the leafs.  Good game nonetheless

831337,Dan668,2014-01-19 02:50:00,1120,Good game for kadri. Stepped it up.
831339,John Bacon,2014-01-19 02:53:00,3277,First time I have ever seen them award a goal without the puck going in the net.  I guess the logic is that he is entitled to a penalty shot on an empty net... which would just be a formality.
831342,leaf4,2014-01-19 02:57:00,2466,"not a new practice, it just doesn't often happen"
831344,DRIFTER_016,2014-01-19 03:00:00,10439,Seen it a couple of times this season already.
831345,tb4me,2014-01-19 03:01:00,3295,First time I have ever seen them award a goal without the puck going in the net.  I guess the logic is that he is entitled to a penalty shot on an empty net... which would just be a formality. I love that rule as the only other possible outcome would be to put the goalie back in for a penalty shot witch would be unfair
831347,BillM,2014-01-19 03:02:00,17367,Trolling PK!!!! hahahahhahahaha!   Good job JVR!!!!!!!!

By then, the cap could be $80 million, which means $16 million a year for Stamkos.  (these salaries are going to be ridiculous!!)   JvR had another good game, he loves his backhand jeez"

If the percentage of pucks being deflected into the net was so high as to not substantiate getting a stick in the lane, it would be the goalies freaking out on their dman.

829196,tb4me,2014-01-08 01:35:00,3295,I dont get it..Why after such a HUGE stinker on Sat night did Bernier get the nod yet again..Reims must have pissed off coach Randy something bad. Orr is a one man hitting machine out there tonight...Wow
829201,kickingfrog,2014-01-08 02:02:00,8333,Reimer gave the coach the stink eye in the wings game before Christmas. That was the last start he has had.
829202,manitoubass2,2014-01-08 02:11:00,11391,And another bernier goal assisted by phaneuf! Lol. Geez

829204,Dan668,2014-01-08 02:12:00,1120,Is that 7 own goals by Dion since coming back from the suspension? No wonder Team Canada didn't want him
829205,tb4me,2014-01-08 02:14:00,3295,Yes Dion tipped it..At the blue line..Bernie had all kinds of time to stop that..Weak..All but one goal tonight was weak. Man Coach Randy is ticking me off big time..I dont like his choices at all...
829206,muskymatt,2014-01-08 02:16:00,2608,"Did Panuf just score on his own net again?  And that folks, is the laffs have no players in the Olympics  Bwahaha..."

829247,BillM,2014-01-08 05:08:00,17367,Bernier didn't help them out with a few softies that's for sure.
829277,Jds63,2014-01-08 15:30:00,1365,"Ive been purposely avoiding this thread because i don't want aggravate my Blood pressure, but watching the Leafs as of late has that affect on my BP anyways.  What the hell is going on with them ???  I wonder if anyone keeps a stat on how many goals Phaneuf has scored on his own team (via deflections) since he has joined the Leafs, and how that compares with other players nhl wide. It just seems I have seen so many goals go in off him over the last few years and thats gotta make it frustrating for the goalie.  When its 5 on 5 and they get trapped in their own end why do the Leafs collapse to a small box ?? why do the wingers collapse and not cover the points ? it seems so obvious but hey im just a frustrated fan .... !!!  no big point shots, no jam plays , no aggression in front of net ... Kessels 30ft wrist shots aren't going to cut every night, everybody knows VanRiemsdyks cute little play off the side of the net now, so stop trying it !!!! They are not even close to the caliber of the Pens, Canucks and Bruins  Just my frustrated 2 cents ...  as i mentioned a few weeks back .... why does this guy get paid more than a top defenceman like Zdeno Chara ?"
829278,BillM,2014-01-08 15:31:00,17367,"Getting a puck deflected off your stick is not the same as an own goal.  Come on guys, don't be silly."
829281,Jds63,2014-01-08 15:54:00,1365,"Not being silly at all ...  On a shot from outside of the blue line you don't have to be a professional hockey player to know not to put your stick in front of it , I think i would have confidence in my goalie to stop the puck. Last year he put 3 goals in 1 game past Reimer.  Stuff like that plays havoc with a Goalies confidence .... Cherry always reinforces his point that defencemen block shots with the body not with your stick, let the goalie handle the shot. If they had that goal back the game might have had a better outcome.  Like I said , pucks go in off players all the time I know, but Phanuef is ridiculous , i wonder if anyone keeps stats on this stuff."
829289,BillM,2014-01-08 16:44:00,17367,"Bernier had more then enough time to correct and stop that puck, he shot it outside the blue line!  LOL!!   I'm not saying Dion isn't to blame as well, but Bernie owns 50% of the blame in this case."
829076,lookinforwalleye,2014-01-07 19:55:00,4399,"Crawford, Flurry, Brouder for a start. Well I am guessing the brain trust had a good reason not to select anyone of those 3...Time will tell!!!"

829088,lookinforwalleye,2014-01-07 20:42:00,4399,Now would you say that if Price was the LAFSS goalie? Exactly....I think most of the bias against Subban and Price is more about the uniform they wear rather than their skill level.  At the end of the day arguments can be made for and against a lot of the players selected...I hope that the managers picked the right team and that team will be good enough to bring home a gold medal!!!

The Sens pounded not only Price, but the team as a whole. Awful, is a matter of opinion, your opinion! Based on the fact you have been rooting for a laffable team that has no excuse for the last 48 years performance, your opinion, and ability to recognize talent means nothing is completely dismissed!  Now go and look at the Keon and Pulford posters in your room to make yourself feel better!"

In the previous season Mtl finished 6th in the conference and again had the 5th best GAA.

Poor sentence structure on my part. I was referring to the last 2 seasons.  If Canada plays for gold it's 7 games. A hot goalie means any of 5-6 teams could win this. I don't like price on the big ice in a short tournament over many other options. Not surprisingly, there are others who feel differently."

Price is no where near the top of his game. Either is  Lego. I'll agree that Bernier is better than Remier but he shouldnt be on team Canada. Leafs had an easy first half schedule, now with tougher teams in the second half they are going to start losing games. Bernier won't be as good with a higher voulme of shot coming on net, especially in the olympics when everyone is a high calibre player.  Mike Smith was a solid choice, i'm glad he was chosen. I wouldnt hesitate to throw him in net if Price starts to waver."

Thornton is having a great season but along with Carter and Richards, I don't think he'll be on the roster.  We shall find out in just over 30mins!"

It wasn't one or two goals. We've got beat by four - one empty netter.  We had four (or five) pp's that we weren't able to score on.  I don't like excuses. We got beat.
828526,lookinforwalleye,2014-01-04 20:23:00,4399,News flash for the Canadian boys you are playing in Europe and the officiating will be different apparently they never read the memo.

828497,Steve,2014-01-04 19:13:00,2075,don't underestimate the Finns.  they are strong.  they also want to play Sweden more than you can imagine. its the Canada / usa rivalry of Europe.  (of course I'm slightly bias being from a Finn background).
828498,DRIFTER_016,2014-01-04 19:13:00,10439,Man they call some pretty lame penalties over there don't they?

And the head shot penalty the diving Fin went down when he seen the hit coming..Brutal calls..Typical European hockey..Slash and dive you way to a loss..Man i really hope we stomp them a new one now..Go Canada Go!
828511,Steve,2014-01-04 19:34:00,2075,"some very bad calls this game.  but its going both ways.  we just had two pp's in a row and couldn't score.  the goalie penalty was brutal, as was the head shot penalty.  go Canada!"

828115,tb4me,2014-01-02 16:20:00,3295,Not a fan of the dirty play today. I do not want kessel to get hurt or lupul to sit out. I would like to see the best players play. Refs need to call it all. Not pick and choose. They control who wins too often. Wrecking the game. I couldnt agree more.. I have been saying this all year..It seems real bad this year doesnt it...
828116,tb4me,2014-01-02 16:35:00,3295,"EH OH GO CANADA GO.....In other news I see Bobby dang Ryan is taking the news well....Ha ha ha Burkie once a Leaf always a Leaf..He doesn't pick Ryan for the Olympic team cause he is a stinking Sen....But seriously he didnt pick him because he doesn't play with enough intensity ..So what does he do? He insults USA hockey brass by calling them gutless...LOL way to seal the deal Bobby..He has now most likely shot himself in the foot if any roster spots open up due to injuries in the next month..Here's what hockey USA had to say Team USA's selection committee wasn't sold on Ottawa winger Bobby Ryan. Advice: One member of the committee was quoted saying, ""I think he's sleepy. I think he skates sleepy."" GM David Poile asked: ""Are guys nervous about Bobby Ryan?"" A flurry of hands went up and Poile said, ""That's a lot of guys."" It also sounds like the committee wasn't sure what role to give Ryan because they didn't see him as a top-six forward. However, it's still very surprising to us that a player of his talent level didn't make the cut. "
828149,kickingfrog,2014-01-02 21:21:00,8333,"Interesting article about from a reporter who was given a lot of inside access to the US team selection. Where the sleepy quote comes from.  I don't know enough about the US team to know if Ryan should, or shouldn't, make the team but the question I have is: ""Who's spot does he take?"" And as they mention in the article if Ryan isn't a top 6 forward would he be good enough to play a bottom 6 role?  http://espn.go.com/new-york/story/_/id/10195703/how-us-hockey-team-bound-sochi-olympics-was-named"

828316,kickingfrog,2014-01-03 20:17:00,8333,He won't get off so easy next time. He is too valuable and misses enough games due to injury already.

No, I think the stars should be treated just like everyone else. That means they are not treated as targets by goons and extra effort is made to knock them off their game or out of the game. Guys who can hardly play the game should not be chasing stars around solely targeting them with dirty, illegal hits. Any way you look at the hit on Crosby during the classic game it was a hit to the head, the guy can deny it all he wants but it looked like a deliberate attempt to injure."

I agree we have to work on our goal-tending as a whole.If this the best we have were in trouble for the next few years..

827475,lookinforwalleye,2013-12-30 20:29:00,4399,True enough but by the same token most of the other top teams have eligible players playing pro aswell.  Galchenyuk is 19 so he could have played for the USA team.

827545,tb4me,2013-12-31 01:05:00,3295,Wow Mac with the HUGE shootout win! What a show he put on...Nice
827559,leaf4,2013-12-31 03:13:00,2466,"Why would they make nazem available? they have him over a barrel for this season and next 2.9 is a steal, he could be getting 4mill maybe more if he were a free agent. I hope they don't trade him"
827561,BillM,2013-12-31 03:28:00,17367,"Rumors are floating around Komarov wants to be back in a blue/white jersey.   I'd happily accept!!!!  And don't trade Kadri, hopefully this is just a way to light a fire under his ass."
827247,Steve,2013-12-29 22:21:00,2075,"lupes would be the next best bet, but he never even comes close to playing a full season, so how do you give your captain to someone who likely is going to miss 1/3 the year (or more)."
827249,kickingfrog,2013-12-29 22:34:00,8333,"No other 20 to 30 minute players , epically D-men will sign for less..  There are over 90 defencemen that fit your criteria."
827250,davey buoy,2013-12-29 22:35:00,5505, There are over 90 defencemen that fit your criteria. And they all play way too many minutes imo.
827251,davey buoy,2013-12-29 22:39:00,5505,"With todays fast pace and physical game,how can any player be that effective playing about half the game ?Because they play more minutes make them worth more?I think not."
827254,Steve,2013-12-29 22:49:00,2075,"but today's nhl is slowed down substantially.  tv time outs are longer than ever.  refs are allowing longer periods of time between dropping the puck.  heck, we are seeing goalies going to their benches between puck drops.  with modern training technologies, and the time that the nhl allows to keep their game ""fast"", i think its possible to play 25 minutes a game...especially as a defenceman."
827265,kickingfrog,2013-12-29 23:14:00,8333,The top pairing plays so much more because the bottom pairing is not good enough. Coaches coach to win. If they thought playing number 5-6 D-men more would help them they would.  Top Defencemen play more minutes per game then forwards not because they are better conditioned but because the position does not require the same level of stop and go or puck chasing.
827267,Nipfisher,2013-12-29 23:38:00,2449,I think Bolland would make a great captain.
827277,kickingfrog,2013-12-30 00:04:00,8333,"On the Sochi watch, Stamkos has been skating but being in Olympic shape in a little over a month might be just too much."
827287,lowerunit,2013-12-30 01:07:00,53,"Is Dion Phaneuf worth the contract thats rumored? 7 Million per year for seven years and a no trade no movement clause. I really dont see him worth the dollars they are throwing at him. He isnt going to the Olypics so hes not in the top 6 or 8 Canadian defensemen. In my opinion he dosent do enough to make me feel like he is going to get better. Of the last six or seven Leaf captains id rate him last. He dosent get people out of their seats with his rushes his hits are few and far between. His defense partner Gunnarson in my opinion carries the load in the Leaf end.  He plays the majority of the power play and only has 14 points. He dosent do it for me as a captain or as a number one defenceman. Whats Subban, Karlsson gonna get when their contracts expires? I dunno just seems like a lot of cash and way too many years in this deal for his talent in my opinion. I know if they are gonna pay him that kinda coin he isnt gonna say no but what do they see in him that I dont lol ."

827358,danc,2013-12-30 05:31:00,4677,"Leafs needed to win by more than one goal tonight imho, and they did. Even if it was against my home town Staal bros. I ran into Eric at a local gas station this past summer. Nice humble guy."

Wonder if Reims gets the net at the outdoor classic. Bernie has had 3 in a row now..GO LEAFS GO!!!!"
827372,BillM,2013-12-30 13:00:00,17367,Reims gets the start in the Winter Classic for sure.

827421,lookinforwalleye,2013-12-30 17:27:00,4399,I think in the last few years the quality of the teams has improved greatly...not enough to just show up and win a medal. As recent drafts would suggest 50% of top prospects and drafted players are non Canadian!!! For the most part the games are competitive and it makes for a great tournament!!!
827425,manitoubass2,2013-12-30 17:38:00,11391,Uh oh! Seen that coming. Stay outta the box boys

827059,kickingfrog,2013-12-28 18:04:00,8333,"Sixty minute games and usually 3 pairings. Break-down is something like 25-30, 15-20, 10-15.  Every team in the league usually has two (some have 3-4) 20minute plus D-men. Most of those teams will not shell out $14 mill for their top 2 D-men.  I'll concede that many teams will pay their number 1 D-man $7 million plus but not every 20 min/game player and not a 7 year deal."
827060,jbailey,2013-12-28 18:11:00,866,how does he not get an abuse of official penalty on that?! he laid that linesmen out! (junior game)

827079,Steve,2013-12-28 18:52:00,2075,i think the linesman was embarrassed that he caved that easily.  i don't think the cze guy intended it to go down like that.  likely 2m was the right call.

Welcome to the newly structured CBA and the new NHL. Im sorry to say but IMHO I think your wrong.. its the way ALL contracts are going to go from here on in im afraid..I don't agree with it and I dont think the cap should go up to 70 mill either..

I honestly thought Dion was gonna push for a 1 year extension so he could go for the 8 to 10 mill next year cause that's what they will be looking for The cba has greatly suppressed stars contracts on a per year dollar value but the terms have been extended to try to make up some of the difference. The cap goes up only if the league makes more money.  There are currently 98 NHL defencemen averaging over 20 minutes per game, that's 3.2 per team. There are another 26 averaging over 19 minutes per game. It is very unlikely more than 30 of them will ever get 7 million dollar deals.  As an aside: Pronger is still on the flyers' cap for 4 more years after this season at a cap hit of $4,921,429 and he hasn't played since the start of 2011.  Long term deals are great for the players and I don't begrudge them getting paid but has a fan I hate them, and the cap.  The league has had the cap for almost 10 years now. Still waiting for the ticket prices to come down the way bettman said they would once the league had its ""cost certainty"". It's almost as if the league lets the market set the ticket price."

826725,jbailey,2013-12-26 11:31:00,866,nice seats!
826745,kickingfrog,2013-12-26 15:00:00,8333,The last couple of off-seasons the building has had major renos. This season there is a new suspended walkway that has some premium seating and a media area. From the comments on twitter the Toronto media that were seeing this new area (and the new centre ice video scoreboard) for the first time were very impressed and said it was the best in the league. My seat was about halfway up the upper bowl and two seats to the left of centre ice.  The suspended seating doesn't block the ice for any seats but does block the new scoreboard so on the backside there are 3 very large TV screens. At the bottom of the screen is also a stats area that includes the usual stuff as well as who is on the ice face-off percentage and other tidbits.

826876,tb4me,2013-12-27 18:48:00,3295,"Big game tonight..Ranger remains in the lineup.. I cant help but wonder what he has in his back pocket on coach Randy. The guy sucks, Liles has played well every game he has been in and is a plus player. Why we keep trying the Ranger experiment is way beyond me...I had a ittle birdie tell me that Bolland was skating over the holiday break..Thank frig. he will be welcomed back"
826877,Steve,2013-12-27 19:07:00,2075,"Ranger is very hot and cold  beginning of the season, or really, even the first half of what they have played, ranger has been rough at best.  but then every once and a while he comes through and shines.  he has been killing penalties.  he has been making some good plays.  maybe he is coming around.  maybe not.  we'll see."

But the bleep factor goes up for boh coaches and Babcock tosses the cameras out after the game against the Ducks.  And I think we're missing out because the HBO show is 53 minutes without any commercials. Maybe it's the bleeps?

826331,jbailey,2013-12-24 01:44:00,866,battle of the goaltenders! exciting game even though its pretty sloppy
826332,leaf4,2013-12-24 01:45:00,2466,bernier really is in the zone tonight! these penalties are going to be the death of them though Bernie is keeping them in there for sure though
826333,danc,2013-12-24 01:47:00,4677,"Gotta admit that Bernier can really hang on to the puck and not give up many rebounds. Still don't like him in the shootouts though. If it comes to that, I hope he proves me wrong."
826334,kickingfrog,2013-12-24 01:48:00,8333,I'm at centre ice listening to some of the funniest people who think their talkin' hackey.

826361,danc,2013-12-24 03:09:00,4677,"Well that supports my theory about Bernier in the shootouts. I'm pretty sure that I could make my way down the ice with my gum boots on, pick a corner, and score. It's that easy. Nash was the only guy that didn't score because he made a move instead of picking one of the wide open corners."
826362,glen,2013-12-24 03:16:00,2641,Sloppy. Rielly was -12 before the game. Rob should do the colour commentating.

Flashes of brilliance followed by long periods of laffitis! Frustrating to say the least but being year 3 of a 5 year rebuild, it is what it is.  Laffs Suck!!"

825868,danc,2013-12-22 03:04:00,4677,You might as well place a bowling pin in the net instead of Bernier in the shootouts. I'm pretty sure that I could score on him. If Carlyle had any balls at all he would have put Reimer back in for the shootout.
825045,Richie Razor,2013-12-18 17:08:00,536,"Lol yeah, who is MM to talk of the richest hockey club in the world folding? I guess that's the business acumen of the guy.  It's fans like that that will certainly see the Sens move to Quebec."

825058,Jds63,2013-12-18 18:06:00,1365,"Ive been purposely avoiding this thread because i don't want aggravate my Blood pressure, but watching the Leafs as of late has that affect on my BP anyways.  What the hell is going on with them ???  I wonder if anyone keeps a stat on how many goals Phaneuf has scored on his own team (via deflections) since he has joined the Leafs, and how that compares with other players nhl wide. It just seems I have seen so many goals go in off him over the last few years and thats gotta make it frustrating for the goalie.  When its 5 on 5 and they get trapped in their own end why do the Leafs collapse to a small box ?? why do the wingers collapse and not cover the points ? it seems so obvious but hey im just a frustrated fan .... !!!  no big point shots, no jam plays , no aggression in front of net ... Kessels 30ft wrist shots aren't going to cut every night, everybody knows VanRiemsdyks cute little play off the side of the net now, so stop trying it !!!! They are not even close to the caliber of the Pens, Canucks and Bruins  Just my frustrated 2 cents ..."

825074,glen,2013-12-18 18:53:00,2641,Desire to win.  Not enough players have it.
825078,BillM,2013-12-18 19:05:00,17367,"Desire to win.  Not enough players have it.  I wish it was that simple.  If they sucked all the time it would probably be easier to deal with.  But then you see games like they played earlier this season (Which Raf referred to) and the more recent games like the one against Chicago and the Pens.   Awesome games (Even with the loss against the Pens), then they come out like they did against Florida..  I just don't get it...  Completely different teams depending on which night it is.  For me at least, that's the frustrating part."

825014,muskymatt,2013-12-18 14:17:00,2608,"3 with a game in hand. Its only a matter of time now, the laffs playing as bad as they ever have. Dion is living us to his reputation and the rest.....bwahahaha"
825015,misfish,2013-12-18 14:21:00,29133,"The leafs are becoming hard to watch. Im even yelling at them,and they cant hear me.LOL  Something needs to happen,and happen quick.  Oh as far as Dion. What a bigggggggg mistake. Too much money for nothing."
825016,BillM,2013-12-18 14:21:00,17367,"I don't know how all this trash talk comes from a Senorita fan, lol.    Matt, I suggest you look up the definition of 'irony'"
825020,muddler,2013-12-18 14:54:00,623,Don't worry. The Laffs will bounce back. Muddler
825026,Headhunter,2013-12-18 16:04:00,5703,"Well, if this type of play keeps happening, I think Randy may be ""toast"" by the new year! He must feel like he is ""stuck in an oven"" feeling the heat! HH"
825030,BillM,2013-12-18 16:19:00,17367,"No way they are going to fire Carlyle.  We all know they can play good (Look at the LA, Chicago and the Pens game).  Just gotta figure out a way to keep them on that level.  I can't wait until Bolland is back, he's going to make quite the difference I think."
825033,muskymatt,2013-12-18 16:27:00,2608,"I think they should fire Randy, get rid of all the players, fold the organization and start over. They could start with a new name and fresh slate, after all, they haven't had any measurable success in almost 50 years lol"
825034,muskymatt,2013-12-18 16:28:00,2608,I have to agree. Bolland is going to save the team lol.
825036,Headhunter,2013-12-18 16:34:00,5703,"Well, if this type of play keeps happening, I think Randy may be ""toast"" by the new year! He must feel like he is ""stuck in an oven"" feeling the heat!

They could start with a new name and fresh slate, after all, they haven't had any measurable success in almost 50 years lol Easy there MM. The Sen's will probably be the ones who fold AGAIN the way the CAP is predicted to rise in the next few years. And yes.... the Leafs probably won't have a cup by then... but at least we will have a team. A few more years of ""It's to far to the rink"" or ""I would rather stay at home and watch the game"" and this might be a reality for you and your teams pathetic fan base."
825041,BillM,2013-12-18 16:47:00,17367,"I have to agree. Bolland is going to save the team lol.  I dunno about save the team, but I'll take him over Clarkson!  LOL!"
824647,muskymatt,2013-12-16 22:42:00,2608,"Pens are missing letang, malkin, and Neal. Easy leaf win. Book it  Easy win alright. lolol, too funny!  Of all the laffites, you crack me up the most!! "
824659,leaf4,2013-12-16 23:14:00,2466,"Lupul: YOU SIT DOWN hahahahahahahaha hahahaha I love i,t would be wicked to watch that all the time with them mic'd up"
824689,Dan668,2013-12-17 00:14:00,1120,Really dion. Another own goal. 3 in two games. Solid
824725,tb4me,2013-12-17 01:19:00,3295,Morgan Reily gets his first goal of the season assisted by Bernier...Sweet!
824732,Richie Razor,2013-12-17 01:29:00,536,"Whooooo!!!! Two good tilts for Bodie!!! When's the last time Clarkson fought 2 guys in a game for the leafs??? Ahhhh, that's above his pay scale now..."
824734,DRIFTER_016,2013-12-17 01:31:00,10439,Bodie has a bug in his shorts doesn't he?
824742,tb4me,2013-12-17 01:55:00,3295,So is the Crosby head hit on Kadri a suspendable hit? Some how I doubt it?
824745,leaf4,2013-12-17 01:58:00,2466,there was minimal contact at best no way
824747,DRIFTER_016,2013-12-17 01:58:00,10439,Kadri should have dropped to the ice and played dead.
824751,Richie Razor,2013-12-17 02:09:00,536,Kadri should have cold clocked that cry baby. The wuss didn't even get hit and tried to mix-it up with Naz. I guess he thinks he's too good for getting hit.
824754,BillM,2013-12-17 02:11:00,17367,Good pressure by the Leafs!
824757,leaf4,2013-12-17 02:18:00,2466,hahahaha bernier slick move
824758,DRIFTER_016,2013-12-17 02:18:00,10439,WOOHOO!!!!!! AWESOME HIT BY BERNIER!!!!!!!
824761,Steve,2013-12-17 02:29:00,2075,that was ... interesting ...
824762,Richie Razor,2013-12-17 02:42:00,536,"Man I feel bad for Jerry D'Amigo, poor kid. Just shows the NHL is a man's, man's league."
824764,Richie Razor,2013-12-17 02:51:00,536,Yup.
824770,blaque,2013-12-17 03:10:00,2419,"D'Amigo: ""note to self, dump the puck.....DUMP IT""!!!"
824771,leaf4,2013-12-17 03:14:00,2466,"too bad they couldn't take it to OT they deserved at least a point with that effort, oh well Crosby got me 2 points having a game winner lol"

824778,muskymatt,2013-12-17 03:58:00,2608,Weren't the laffs supposed to roll over another injury depleted team?  Go Pens!!

824781,DRIFTER_016,2013-12-17 04:19:00,10439,This was my favorite part of tonight's game.  
824793,Stoty,2013-12-17 08:30:00,2910," HAHAHAHAHA The day that ""Sidney Kadri"" cold clocks anyone/anything is the day they win the cup..... and we all know how that ends. He couldnt even beat the crap outta his own underwear. Look Kadri...here comes Gallagher... RUN!!!!!!!!!"
824795,blaque,2013-12-17 12:27:00,2419,"Dion. Would it kill'em to smile...once! He's living his dream job, with a dream wife and I can't help but think that he looks simply miserable. My take anyway. HH  He does seem to carry that scowl with him wherever he goes.............kinda like the outcast son from Wedding Crashers  "
824350,tb4me,2013-12-15 02:49:00,3295,"SWEET!!!!! Lupes makes it 6-2!!!!! I don't know what Randy said after the St. Louis game but he needs to say it after every game!!!!!! He said it to Frazer and Ranger this morning, that was your sitting...Great game by JML..Welcome back bud. The whole team played well but the guy the stood out most was Mason Raymond..Superb game with a 4 point night! GO LEAFS GO!"
824361,BillM,2013-12-15 04:09:00,17367,"Wow where did this team come from?  Pleasantly surprised, although feel bad for the rookie goalie they put in for the start of the 3rd.  First NHL start, first shot, first goal against.  Holland should have had the hat trick!   Boys played well tonight, first to the puck, won the battles in the corners, guess what happens when you do that?  I love watching Raymond with that puck as well, man he's got some moves."
824362,Richie Razor,2013-12-15 04:09:00,536,"Woooohoooo!!! Big win, great game to get back on track boys!!!! Lets keep her rolling against the Pens, and I can see the leafs maintaining the same intensity for that game. Awesome."
824368,lookinforwalleye,2013-12-15 05:53:00,4399,SWEET!!!!! Lupes makes it 6-2!!!!! I don't know what Randy said after the St. Louis game but he needs to say it after every game!!!!!! Shouldn`t really be surprised that the Leafs lit the lamp against the Hawks they are 1 of 6 teams that have allowed 100 goals this season if they had a decent goal tending this year they may be undefeated.
824372,jbailey,2013-12-15 07:07:00,866,Leafs looked good tonight. Can this win help them bounce back?
824387,kickingfrog,2013-12-15 15:30:00,8333,"24/7 starts tonight on sportsnet. Never watched the other ones (don't have HBO). I'll be interested to see what, and how much, real behind the scenes stuff they show us."
824397,manitoubass2,2013-12-15 17:01:00,11391,Im massively looking forward to 24/7. These are absolutely awesome! Insight that sportsfans rarely ever see. Its always VERY entertaining
824404,kickingfrog,2013-12-15 17:11:00,8333,Your excitement is obvious.

824456,tb4me,2013-12-15 23:52:00,3295,It aired last night for American fans..Sadly we will have to wait and watch a watered down version censored to no end
824464,BillM,2013-12-16 00:21:00,17367,DL'd the HBO version yesterday.  Great show!
824468,tb4me,2013-12-16 00:36:00,3295,Good gawd I hate to complain but its bad enough that we have to wait an extra day to watch a censored show but now we have to wait for american football to finish...Brutal.
824469,tb4me,2013-12-16 00:37:00,3295,DL'd the HBO version yesterday.  Great show! Bill where did you get it.. I looked couldn't find it

824598,Headhunter,2013-12-16 19:29:00,5703,"I enjoyed the show for what it was... but what I did take away from watching it, was what seems to me anyway and a very unhappy Dion. Would it kill'em to smile...once! He's living his dream job, with a dream wife and I can't help but think that he looks simply miserable. My take anyway. HH"
824599,Squid,2013-12-16 19:31:00,1656,You guys are drinking too much of that blue colored  Kool-aid. It's almost like you leaf fans have a bromance with the team.........
824600,kickingfrog,2013-12-16 19:31:00,8333,I've never watched the series before. Does the narrator always read hockey clocks wrong? i.e. A goal was scored with 3: whatever left on the clock and the narration was that a goal was scored 3 minutes into the period.
824602,fishsevern,2013-12-16 19:39:00,112,Nice to see Leafs getting lots of extras this year like the 24/7 and an outdoor game.  Destroyed the hawks thanks to our 3rd and 4th lines.  Go Leafs!  I will be the Last Fan Standing.
824610,davey buoy,2013-12-16 20:14:00,5505,"If we get half the effort(you know this Leafs team),we could get a win.Having said that the Penguins are on a bit of a roll of late.Giver guys is all I can say!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
824637,Richie Razor,2013-12-16 22:21:00,536,"Pens are missing letang, malkin, and Neal. Easy leaf win. Book it"
824644,davey buoy,2013-12-16 22:39:00,5505,"Pens are missing letang, malkin, and Neal. Easy leaf win. Book it Seems easy,but knowing this team,depends if they show up or not!"
824646,muskymatt,2013-12-16 22:40:00,2608,"You guys are drinking too much of that blue colored  Kool-aid. It's almost like you leaf fans have a bromance with the team.........  So true. The love in is about to make me barf.  But then after 48 years of sucking, they aren't about to stop any time soon. It's an illness."
824298,tb4me,2013-12-14 22:39:00,3295,I could be wrong but I think he forfeits his salary to the players foundation. the leafs still have to pay but Clarkson doesn't get the money You are 100% correct .. I did however fix your spelling error
824300,muskymatt,2013-12-14 22:40:00,2608,You are 100% correct .. I did however fix your spelling error you should know by now that's not an error!  lol....too funny...but thanks
824305,DRIFTER_016,2013-12-14 22:55:00,10439,"Well, Thornton got 15 games off for his beat down on Orpik."
824309,muskymatt,2013-12-14 23:28:00,2608,"A bit much, I know the guy hit a guy who was down but it's his first offense. I thought 7-10 would be appropriate."
824311,tb4me,2013-12-14 23:38:00,3295,"A bit much, I know the guy hit a guy who was down but it's his first offense. I thought 7-10 would be appropriate. Well today is the day..I agree with MM.. Seems a bit much..Clarkson suspended 2 games for trying to avoid a hit. Clarkson had the player lined up so the St Louis player turns to make himself vulnerable and vola Clarkson is gone.. If you watch the video you can clearly see he pulled his shoulder back at the last second trying to avoid his head..His head wasnt there half a second before..The NHL is single handedly destroying  this wonderful sport,"
824313,tb4me,2013-12-14 23:43:00,3295,I also think that the suspended player should be out as long as the injured player is..Plain and simple..No injury no suspension..Simple yet effective. I also think a unsportsmanlike like penalty should be given for wimps that turn to make themselves vulnerable this garbage has become the new diving
824316,glen,2013-12-15 00:06:00,2641,Yep. Refs call who wins.
824321,Dan668,2013-12-15 00:49:00,1120,Own goal. Thanks Dion. Best player on the opposing team
824322,tb4me,2013-12-15 01:04:00,3295,Hey MM Grapes agrees with you and I 15 was to much..10 was perfect..
824323,DRIFTER_016,2013-12-15 01:11:00,10439,He also agrees with me that Orpik should have stood up for himself in the first place instead of being a pussy!!!
824326,Dan668,2013-12-15 01:21:00,1120,Second own goal. Amazing. Thank goodness it was waived off.
824327,DRIFTER_016,2013-12-15 01:23:00,10439,Second own goal. Amazing. Thank goodness it was waived off.  It would be nice if he would direct a few at the opposing teams goal.
824329,Dan668,2013-12-15 01:39:00,1120, It would be nice if he would direct a few at the opposing teams goal. I know. Next will be a too many men for Chicago if he keeps it up.
824332,DRIFTER_016,2013-12-15 01:45:00,10439,"Looking good so far. Good compete level, lot's of pressure and some scoring to boot. Hopefully they can keep it up for 25 more minutes. And now another Leafs PP!!! If they could play like this every night I would be a happy man."
824334,lookinforwalleye,2013-12-15 01:48:00,4399,Is that my sister playing goal for the hawks...brutal!!!
824335,tb4me,2013-12-15 01:49:00,3295,If they could play like this every night I would be a happy man. If they played like this every night id a sober man..Oh wait...nevermind But ya Holland drops a deuce on Chicago Raymond has a 3 pointer so far..What a great game.....So far
824336,davey buoy,2013-12-15 01:49:00,5505,"The way there playing now,you would think they were the best team in the league.lol. Just hope they can keep it up for the third period."
824337,DRIFTER_016,2013-12-15 01:51:00,10439,Phaneuf finally touched a puck that meant something for the good guys!!!
824338,tb4me,2013-12-15 01:53:00,3295,What the heck is going on ...Were out shooting the Stanley Cup champs 45-21...
824339,DRIFTER_016,2013-12-15 01:56:00,10439,"What the heck is going on ...Were out shooting the Stanley Cup champs 45-21...  UHHHHHH, don't you mean 25-21?"
824340,tb4me,2013-12-15 02:01:00,3295," UHHHHHH, don't you mean 25-21? ahh that would explain it..Read a tweet it was 45-21"
824341,lookinforwalleye,2013-12-15 02:05:00,4399,Looks like the Leafs are home and cooled out tonite!!!
824343,DRIFTER_016,2013-12-15 02:15:00,10439,SWEET!!!!! Lupes makes it 6-2!!!!! I don't know what Randy said after the St. Louis game but he needs to say it after every game!!!!!!
824344,lookinforwalleye,2013-12-15 02:16:00,4399,Lol....they pull my sister and put in somebody else's sister. Lol
824349,DRIFTER_016,2013-12-15 02:47:00,10439,Hope they play like this Monday night.
824123,jbailey,2013-12-13 23:36:00,866,"Shop their #1 D man?  lol!   If anyone is going to be up on the block it will be someone like Gardiner, Liles, etc..  It won't be Dion or Kadri. He's their ""#1 D man"", he plays about 6 mins more a game then he should, he becomes a liability. On any other team Phaneuf would not be a leaned on nearly as much, and I'm sure there are many teams that would be interested in him for depth, not a #1 D man. More importantly, his contract is running out and if the leafs resign him its going to be for a ridiculous amount of money, wouldn't be worth it, cripples your rookies."
824127,jbailey,2013-12-13 23:39:00,866,And you make it sound by shopping Phaneuf and Kadri you get nothing in return. I'm sure it would be surprising to see who teams would be willing to part with. Trading Gardiner and Liles is never going to be enough to obtain a player of significant ability to help the leafs out. Go big or go home.
824132,davey buoy,2013-12-13 23:41:00,5505,"And you make it sound by shopping Phaneuf and Kadri you get nothing in return.

824137,leaf4,2013-12-13 23:47:00,2466,"as much as everyone rags on phaneuf he is a solid player, he does make mistakes but if you put him side by side any of the other defenseman in the league that are able to play with the calibre dion does, he doesn't look so bad.  here's a stat that puts him up against other top d men across the league   OTT Even Strength Goals Against 64 Karlsson Even Strength Goals Against 33  CHI Even Strength Goals Against 56 Keith Even Strength Goals Against 22  MTL Even Strength Goals Against 44 Subban Even Strength Goals Against 20  STL Even Strength Goals Against 42 Pietrangelo Even Strength Goals Against 17  MIN Even Strength Goals Against 39 Suter Even Strength Goals Against 16  TOR Even Strength Goals Against 48 Phaneuf Even Strength Goals Against 9  Also on the year, Phaneuf is a +12."

There's no one else in the Leafs D that puts that kind of time in per game and plays with the best players in the league.  It really doesn't matter if you like him or not, there's no way you could trade him for someone who does an as good or better job on the blue line.  No way.    And with the cap raising next year it's more like a 5mil a year hit compared to a 7mil hit if the cap was to remain the same.  Davey, I agree with you on Clarkson..  From what I've seen he's not worth what the Leafs have paid him, let along that stupidly long contract they signed him to...  I dunno what they were thinking when they offered him that."
824145,lookinforwalleye,2013-12-14 00:08:00,4399,Boxing day!!!
824170,DRIFTER_016,2013-12-14 01:48:00,10439,Boxing day!!!  World Jr's.
824174,tb4me,2013-12-14 02:35:00,3295,Oh man I am so looking forward to the world Jr's followed by Olympic Canadian mens hockey..They both make NHL look lame..

824177,DRIFTER_016,2013-12-14 03:37:00,10439, Lol I totally forgot!!  
824178,jbailey,2013-12-14 03:42:00,866,You will never win a cup with Dion as one of your front men. It has nothing to do with I like him or not. He's just not that qualified. He was more useful when he played 20-21 mins a game.
824179,jbailey,2013-12-14 03:46:00,866,"you obviously can't trade up with him but you need to look into the future, realistically there are no moves the leafs can make to make themselves contenders this year, and you move around assests to make that worth it. You don't trade people because they're worthless because you get nothing in return. Unless you want to hold on to someone and left them sell you out like Sundin, or Alfredsson have done."
824187,BillM,2013-12-14 05:16:00,17367,"you obviously can't trade up with him but you need to look into the future, realistically there are no moves the leafs can make to make themselves contenders this year, and you move around assests to make that worth it. You don't trade people because they're worthless because you get nothing in return. Unless you want to hold on to someone and left them sell you out like Sundin, or Alfredsson have done.  You think Sundin sold out the Leafs?   LOL!!!   Trading Dion would be a bonehead move, trust me he's going nowhere.   I just hope they don't get rid of some of their younger talent."
824209,John Bacon,2013-12-14 13:22:00,3277, You think Sundin sold out the Leafs?   LOL!!!  I think it was the Leafs that sold out Sundin... he wanted to finish his career here.
824220,lookinforwalleye,2013-12-14 14:22:00,4399,"Making trades these days is tough everybody seems to over value their assets, probably because there is a lack of imho real talent. Just look at some of the mediocre/average players that are being signed to ridiculous contracts, Clarkson,Horton,Cloye, Deharnais, Gionta 5 million...hasn't had a 50 point season since 2008!!! The last couple of full seasons there has been barely 10 players that can average a point a game...and guys hitting 40-50 points a season are getting long term deals 5-6 million a season. And the sad thing is in a year or two some of these contracts are going to look like a bargain when the cap goes up, I heard a story the other day that PK is considering a shorter term deal his logic is sign now for 2-3 years 7/8 million and cash in when the cap goes crazy....talking 10-12 million a year!!! I don`t know perhaps the league is so competitive now and the players so even in skill that 50 points is the new star player a 80-90 points is the new super star. Not my money."
824240,Steve,2013-12-14 16:25:00,2075,the increased cap will kill the nhl.  there is already great polarity between the teams....and now its only going to get worse.  i don't want the yankee's in the NHL.

824251,Stoty,2013-12-14 17:35:00,2910,Clarkson suspended yet again. Great off-season move!

Neither side negotiated in good faith, and neither side did all they could. If you listen to Alfie, it sounds to me like he had made his mind up even before Bryan Murray called him. And when Murray did call, Alfie didn't answer. Sure I think they should have just given him whatever he wanted. But when he doesn't answer,how can you conduct a negotiation? I think the Sens are a better team with the acquisitions they picked up after Alfie bailed on the team, they just need to get it together.  So, in short, the Sens did not do any such thing as screwing over Alfie, I think it is the other way around. At least the team wasn't on the hook for a $4 mil payout like they were with that piece of garbage Heatly. Good riddance Alfie!"
824255,muskymatt,2013-12-14 18:00:00,2608,Clarkson suspended yet again. Great off-season move! Gives the pretty boy more time for modelling!  What's his contract anyways????  
824262,Steve,2013-12-14 19:12:00,2075,"actually, my old man just pointed out, because players don't get paid during suspension, it would be best for clarkson to get suspended for the rest of the season.  we wouldn't have to pay him and we could replace him for someone from the marlies, making for a win win situation."

824045,Headhunter,2013-12-13 17:37:00,5703,"So, how much longer and how many more losses before management decides to start making significant changes. It's the old story, you can't fire the whole team.... So, bare with me for a moment... Randy was not Nonis's pick for coach, he was Burke's. Burke was let go for not meeting the corporate profile that Rogers/Bell were looking for. I would lump Randy into Burke's camp, before I would place him in the ""good corporate citizen"" group. So, I have to wonder/ponder Randy's longevity with this team. Have the players begun to shut Randy out? Are there enough of them who turn a deaf ear to his style. They sure as heck have enough money to pay him and another new coach... Just some ponderings on a cold December day! Your thoughts? HH"
824046,BillM,2013-12-13 17:42:00,17367,"You can't start making drastic changes because they're in a slump..   Wait until the full line up gets back and if things still aren't working then maybe.  Stoty: That was a good one, lol!"

Sarcasm, say it aint so....We dont need a new coach every season..Were badly injured and need some time to refresh. On another note im hearing Carolina is very interested in Jake Gardiner.. Eric Stall interested..This could be real interesting..We may just get our #1 center soon.! Throw in Kuliman and waive Ranger.. Get Liles back in the mix and call up Brennan and Broll..This is where id start if I were Nunas.But firing the coach is NOT the answer..How many do we fire before we come to the conclusion that upper management needs to step up..FIRE THE COACH ...LOL"
824063,Headhunter,2013-12-13 19:36:00,5703,  Key people out of the line up should not mean that those still playing should give up. It means that those still in the lineup have to step up and play better. That's not happening. Who in the organization has to take responsibility for the preparedness of the team? How long does this team test the patience of ownership? How long before those out of the line up are back in and will the team still have a chance of making the playoffs? I wouldn't be surprised if Randy is feeling a little tightness around the collar. HH
824064,BillM,2013-12-13 19:37:00,17367,"You won't see either of the Staal brothers leaving Carolina.   I also wouldn't give up on Gardiner just yet.  Kid is 23 years old, give him a chance."

HH   With the start of a full season after the lockout just around the corner you have to wonder about Kadris attitude and conduct.  Being disrespectful to one of the pioneers of modern hockey reporting. WTH  Who does this guy think he is?  Has he been smoking up with Rob Ford?  Does he really think he is worth that much money?  Is this guy for real, holding out????    Stay tuned next week for another exciting episode of  ""As the laff turns""     Ahhhh...it all comes full circle!!!  I love it, bwahahahahha, all you laffites were planning the parade two weeks ago, now it's the blame game and falling faster than the chin on a 14 year old boy at the opera.  I love it!!!!

More than  the average goalie has in a whole game.The other 30% are off the boards ,trickelers,shot in from the point on a rush(possible goals)Until we can get the puck out of our own end ,I'm afraid the goalies are doom.Not their fault,but that much activity will kill them and it is IMO.

824111,muskymatt,2013-12-13 23:05:00,2608,"I have to agree tb4me too much disciplinary action will take hitting out of the game, which will be a big mistake. The hits to the head do have to go though, and Clarkson is guilty of just that and deserves to be suspended. That said, the good hits are being scrutinized to death by too many rules and bad officiating, resulting in too many penalties being called and is bad for the game."

I'm starting to wonder what the Leafs saw in him.I believe under 10 points last season in a shortened season.Missed 10 games at the start of the season,other than the exhibition games when he looked good.Did they sign him for two or three years?,pretty good salary if memory serves me right.I'm starting to wonder if the pressure effects some players here?,We have seen a lot of players traded from here and turning out to be great players."

Orpik was knocked unconscious by Boston’s Shawn Thornton in the first period of a 3-2 Bruins’ win on Saturday night. Orpik left the ice on a stretcher when Thornton grabbed Orpik from behind, threw him to the ice and punched him. Penguins coach Dan Bylsma said Monday that Orpik was unconscious for ""30 seconds or more."" Orpik flew home with the team, but is out indefinitely. Bylsma said Orpik is ""doing quite well"" but offered no timetable on a possible return. Pittsburgh recalled defenceman Brian Dumoulin from Wilkes-Barre/Scranton of the American Hockey League to take Orpik’s spot on the roster. "

Ahhh the good ole macho line....if you dont like our manly way of doing things then go watch (insert any sport the manly men think is for sissys) Ahh of course you aren't interested in his trophies, they prove that your argument that Stevens wasn't a good player but just a predator on the ice holds no merit. You're wrong. He's in the hockey hall of fame for crying out loud. Hows that for being respected by his peers and people who played and coached in the NHL? Funny that such a useless player who only managed to hurt people in his 1635 game career managed to fool so many people (who actually know hockey) into thinking he was a good player. Slava Kozlov himself stated that he thought Stevens hit was clean and that he was a clean player. Strange that TSN even celebrates his career by showing ""Top 10 Scott Stevens Hits"" on national TV.

Seriously, he hurt his feelings so Domi hurt his face. Yes, Ulf was dirty but that was still way dirtier than anything Stevens did.  Lindros suffered his 4th concussion (2nd of the year) in March of 2000 (year of the Stevens hit). He criticized the trainers for not diagnosing his concussion, he suffered another concussion while training to get back in the lineup (his 5th), then returned in the playoffs, only playing two games before the Stevens hit (his 6th concussion). He received 4 concussions that season, was playing while still having post concussion syndrome. The Stevens hit was such a small part of why he had all of those issues. It was Lindros' fault, as well as his trainers/team doctors for even playing before he was ready. But oh, lets blame Stevens because he had a highlight reel hit in the playoffs, he's such a big meanie! I guess Stevens should just have avoided touching Lindros because he had concussions before. Oh wait, even that wouldn't have helped him much because Lindros gave himself one of his concussions while THROWING a hit. Oh, you're right, Stevens' peers all hated him because he hit them too hard in a CONTACT sport. Yep, you're spot on. It's pretty clear you have no idea what you're talking about so I'll just leave it at that and let you have your ""victory"". Too bad for you Scott Stevens still has his 3 Stanley cup rings, Conn Smythe trophy, made the all rookie team, was a 1st team all star once, 2nd team all star 3 times and played in the all star game 14 times. Oh and was the longest serving captain of a team he helped go from a ""mickey mouse organization"" to one of the most successful franchises of the last 20 years while being in the hall of fame and is very well respected in the hockey community."

A majority of his hits did target the head or were to late for today's game. He would have had several suspensions. There is no doubting that. This is the no hit league now after all.

I thought I was to the point on the Lindros issue...guess not so here goes nothing.I was at a hitting/concussion seminar years ago and one of the speakers was Brett Lindros.

Peewee was what? 12 and up?   Taking out of Peewee and even Bantam but allowing it in say Midget is a recipe for disaster.  You need to learn how to give and take a hit when you're younger, just like riding a bike.   You get those big boys up in Midget that have never hit before and you're going to end up with some serious injuries.   I realize this is way off topic, but tb4me hit on a pretty good point.  Teach the kids young and it won't be a big deal once they start getting bigger and stronger. The only problem you run into Bill is the size difference of the boys at that age. You have 5 foot tall 125 lb boys skating with 6'4"" 185 lb kids.It is manditory though that they go through a hitting clinic. I do agree with you though."

I find spelling really takes a back seat in importance to reading comprehension.

823141,bobogo,2013-12-09 16:58:00,76,"I love the ""respect"" talk. Even when I play in my crappy men's league there is no respect for other players. Imagine these guys playing to make money for their careers... There will be no respect at all. It's every man for himself. To set themselves apart to make the money. Respect is worthless in sports. Not just professional sports, but leagues at all level. You want to play soft? Have your own friends gather and play a friendly game. When you play to win, hurting the other player is part of the game. Obviously no one wants to end anyone's career but to produce a big hit that Orpiks did is highly sought after.  It's the same question with why is there fighting in hockey? People don't understand that the fighting is there to control the tempo of the game. If players were allowed to make strong hits on other team's star players and being able to hide behind the refs, say good bye to skilled players. They will get rocked all game. People think there is no relation between fighting players and skilled players. Enforcers allow skilled player to play their game.  So yea, what Thorton did was try to defend his teammate because he is an enforcer. But doing what he did was crossing the line, and even he knew that. End of discussion.  Back to the Leafs. They did get alot of shots on the B's which I think is better then the usual loppsided shot counts overall."

823145,Chance,2013-12-09 17:11:00,420,"I am on topic ,I believe it might actually be your comprehension. I was discussing respect and vulnerable hits of which hitting from behind is one example. I am sure it has been part of the game since you were a kid but not knowing your age I dont know how much emphasis was placed on it.I also do not know your level of experience or how you formulate your opinion,but I do respect it. I played for many years at several levels with the exception of one. I now coach children and can tell you the difference between now and then is astounding.When I was younger it was barely mentioned now a weekend is spent on it at every level of minor coaching. Delivering hard hits are fine,knock em out if thats your thing. Look for a player with his head down and hit him hard. Like I said there are many things in the game that are okay by the letter of the law. I do not believe in hitting in a vulnerable position but thats just my opinion."
823147,BillM,2013-12-09 17:23:00,17367,"I don't consider a hit from behind and a guy with his head down even on the same page.   If you think someone skating down the ice with their head down is considered vulnerable, then I guess that's your choice.  So what happens if one of your kids delivers a clean body check, guys head was up, saw it coming.   Kid is laying on the ice out cold, still disrespectful or a good hockey play?"
823151,Chance,2013-12-09 17:43:00,420,"In both instances neither player can see the hit coming and therefore is classed as vulnerable to injury.  As a coach your first concern is the well being of the player on the ice and your player. Your player can be affected at the sight of someone he has hit being carted off on a stretcher. As to a good hockey play its hard to say without a bit more info. If a player is coming out of his zone with the puck head up and gets cranked shoulder to shoulder etc and the puck is turned over then sure good move kid,mission accomplished. The object of hitting is to separate the player from the puck. If he takes himself well out of position to make a useless hit then no ""bad hockey play"" key the Dion Phaneuf montage. the fact that the other player was knocked out cold was unfortunate and a penalty and or discipline in general should not rely on the outcome of the act. Dont get me wrong I love a good hit and a fight even better. I am a staunch advocate of fighting in hockey at the correct level.It controls the game.  Below is a quote from one of the greats,Larry Robinson that might explain my point.  Robinson’s era was as violent a time the NHL has known, but the former Habs’ great insists despite all the violence, players had respect for each other back in the good ol’ days. He told the Mercury News, “There were situations where guys put themselves in a vulnerable position, where if you did make contact, there was a possibility he’d get hurt.  Back then, some guys were stupid enough not to wear helmets, and you’d ease up.”"

Some days I think it would be nice to take parts of todays game and some of the days of old and put them together.You cant beat the speed and skill of players now but back then I think they were alot tougher. I can still remember Terry O Reilly challenging the entire bench to fight LOL How long do you think Matt Cooke would last  with the likes of Tony Twist chasing him down. Ahhh to dream...

Counting penalties in a league that judges everyone differently is silly. Do you think the refs looked at Gretzky the same way they did Domi? Stevens threw plenty of elbows,you want to see them feel free to search. OF COURSE they avoided his side of the ice for fear of getting decimated. He went out to injure plain and simple so if you want to applaud that style of hockey its all yours. Oh and he certainly did ruin Lindros and a few others. How about his Conn Smythe trophy? There's your individual trophy. Best defenseman on a cup winning team 3 times. Edmonton DID win without Gretzky but that didn't diminish how great he was, so your point doesn't matter. New Jersey never won a cup without Stevens, by the way. That's a fact, not a what if or maybe.  Domi...now THERE'S a guy who added nothing but ending players careers. Literally, unlike Stevens who never ended anyone's career despite your claim. What Stevens did was within the rules of the game. His peers respected him which is why he was never named as one of the dirtiest players in the NHL on any player polls.  Lindros ruined Lindros. Like I stated earlier, the Stevens hit wasn't his first concussion. Wasn't even his 2nd. Kasparaitis gave Lindros his first. He's 5'11"", Lindros is 6'4"". He caught Lindros straight on the jaw despite never leaving his feet. How did that happen? Because Lindros had a bad habit of keeping his head down. Should people have let up on poor little old LIndros because he looked at the puck? Because Lindros certainly never held up on the forecheck. I seem to recall Lindros playing after the Stevens hit too, and getting more concussions after that. Stevens never ruined him, despite your claim. The facts suggest otherwise. It was one of many concussions Lindros received in the middle of his career. Just so happened to be his most famous.  Yes, I WILL applaud Stevens and his career.

Ahhh the good ole macho line....if you dont like our manly way of doing things then go watch (insert any sport the manly men think is for sissys)"

823206,tb4me,2013-12-09 23:24:00,3295,"Wow busy day in the Leafs thread..Scott Stvens was the master at what he did..Plain and simple..I enjoyed his game and still do when I watch highlights.However comparing kids hockey to the NHL that's just silly. Perhaps the ""respect"" issue stems from minor hockey but I seriously doubt it..Im 39 and played hockey for 25 years now. When i started there was no hitting, not untill you turned 14..Pee Wee I think it was. Mount Hamilton Minor Hockey Ass. The kids playing today will grow to be softies and extremely vulnerable when they hit semi pro and Pro. The ""respect"" that's spoken of will go out the window the first time another player takes a run at the ""new kid"" to knock him off the puck. The animosity and intensity involved at the elite level is something ill never know... These kids being taught respect in minor leagues will unfortunately find out real quick..It actually worries me.. Instead of teaching them respect they should be taught how to hit correctly, keep your head up and for the love of god pay attention to whom your passing it to. No blind suicide passes. That (imo) is where the kids should be educated."

823212,BillM,2013-12-09 23:41:00,17367,"I don't like the thought of contact being taken out of kids hockey.  When I played, contact started in PeeWee and went on from there.  Peewee was what? 12 and up?   Taking out of Peewee and even Bantam but allowing it in say Midget is a recipe for disaster.  You need to learn how to give and take a hit when you're younger, just like riding a bike.   You get those big boys up in Midget that have never hit before and you're going to end up with some serious injuries.   I realize this is way off topic, but tb4me hit on a pretty good point.  Teach the kids young and it won't be a big deal once they start getting bigger and stronger."

When I played we were introduced to checking at 10 years old, and now unless you play rep you'll never be introduced to body checking and kids just get pushed from behind into the boards because they were never taught how to protect themselves in vulnerable areas on the ice because there wasn't supposed to be any body checking. Pretty hard to stop 16 year old boys from mixing it up haha. Anyway, play lacrosse, the sport hasn't been torn apart yet, likely many hockey leagues."
823034,lookinforwalleye,2013-12-09 01:58:00,4399,"Does not matter it's a violent sport were some will let up on a vulnerable player and others will try and send him to the hospital,remember Scott Stevens every time he hit somebody he tried to hurt them and he had a big smile on his face after laying out a guy....and he used to point his finger at guys telling them they were next. Players(some) these day more than I can ever remember have a total lack of respect for each other....at the end of the day everybody wants to go home to their families and not to the hospital. I don`t have the answer, it`s a contact sport and players are going to get hurt just wish there was a little more respect for each other out there!!!"

823063,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2013-12-09 04:19:00,535,"Stevens definitely couldn't play in todays game with the way he played.  He'd be suspended the entire time.    He most certainly could. His hits were very rarely contacting the head as the principal point of contact, it was usually shoulder to the chest. He just hit with such a force that it hurt people (brain hitting the skull causes concussions, don't need any contact to the head for that). Also remember that Stevens biggest hits were almost always in the playoffs, he played for keeps then. Plus his hits happened during game play and had a purpose, it's part of hockey. Sucker punching a guy well after the whistle when he's on the ice is bush league garbage and had nothing to do with game play.  As for the Orpik hit, it was a good clean hit. Eriksson had a chance to make a play on the puck, it was a classic suicide pass scenario. He stepped up on a player who looked to be receiving a pass (and likely would have 9 times out of 10). It's not like he has to wait until Eriksson has full possession of the puck by taking a few strides after receiving it. If that hit is illegal you might as well just ban body checking altogether."
823068,BillM,2013-12-09 05:03:00,17367,"Are you kidding me?  Stevens was the biggest head hunter out on the ice.  I suggest you take a few mins and search Youtube, lol.  Here, I did it for you.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7U7jUbKQYdw"

Here, I did it for you.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7U7jUbKQYdw As stated earlier, his hits were perfectly legal at the time, not remotely dirty. He was a devastating hitter, the best of his generation. Chris Pronger was a MUCH dirtier player than Stevens and he was still able to play in the ""new NHL"". Wendel Clark would have been suspended a ton of games for his hit on that poor bugger behind the net but it wasn't a bad hit at the time so who cares? You don't think these players are smart enough to change their games, especially Stevens who was one of the best defensive defensemen of his generation? HIs hits on Francis, Lindros, Kariya, Kozlov, Willis, etc.... all came in the playoffs, he only destroyed players when it counted. He had the ability to ease up during the regular season so he would have been smart enough to tweak his hitting technique. Just because a player gets a concussion doesn't mean it was a dirty hit. Look at his hit on Francis. I LOVED Francis growing up being a Pens fan, it was tough to watch him crawling on the ice/falling over afterwards. I had no problem with the hit though.  The NHL needs to seriously start looking at equipment. Shoulder/elbow pads that are hard as a rock and can stop a bullet are not needed. They're used as a weapon, just like helmets are in football. Shanahan of all people should know this, he wore the same old, tiny shoulder pads his entire career."
823107,BillM,2013-12-09 14:34:00,17367,"No one is disputing if they were 'perfectly legal at the time'.    I said, if he threw those type of hits in todays game he'd be suspended, which he would be...  Look at the Lindros, Kariya and Kozlov hits, all head shots.   Perfectly legal back then, in todays game?  Not even close.    Don't get me wrong, I loved Scott Stevens, one of the best defencemen of all time, but in todays game he'd be a one man wrecking ball, with guys laying all over the ice lol!"
823108,Chance,2013-12-09 14:45:00,420,"Stevens was a predator plain and simple,added nothing to the game other than ruining a few careers. He would wait for a player to be in a vulnerable position and either leave his feet,throw an elbow or shoulder to the head. He was on the ice to hurt people not separate them from the puck. That is NOT part of hockey.  Its all about respect and the lack of it is getting worse every year. Years ago if you threw a hit when a player was vulnerable you got a beating. Regardless of using the excuse of a bad pass the defensive player still has the option to hit hard or let up,Orpik chose to hit hard. Thornton tried to get Orpik to fight ,not because it was his job he was pissed about the hit. That is extremely important and at the root of the ordeal.Orpik turned down the invite which if he was smart he would of fought. Hockey is a game of retribution,sooner or later you or someone else is going to pay the price.If he fought that would of been the end of it. As for Thornton he let his emotions get the better of him and did something stupid.What should of happened and was the way things DID happen ""back when"" was Thornton or Lucic went and beat their tough guy silly. You then skate by the bench and give Orpik the wink letting him know that was for him. What Orpik did was within the ""rules"" but remember so is Chara fighting Nathan Gerbe. There are things that just should not happen in a game where one player should respect the other regardless of what colour they wear."
823110,BillM,2013-12-09 14:54:00,17367,"Why should Orpik have to fight after tossing a perfectly legal bodycheck?  Thornton was in the wrong here from the beginning.  Also, if you want to fire up your team go after someone who ACTUALLY FIGHTS!  (Like you mentioned above... tough guy vs tough guy)  Orpiks hit was 100% legal, no headshot, no nothing.  It's a contact sport, guys get hurt.  If Eriksson gets up after the hit and skates away, no one says anything about it.  But because he got his bell rung, then all of a sudden people start questioning the hit?    Eriksson should be pissed at his D man who set him up on a play like that."

As I mentioned there are things that are legal and things that are done without thinking of the other players well being.You see a guy is vulnerable and regardless of if it is legal or not you back off. I think you missed my point.I am not saying Thornton was correct in what he did,quite the opposite actually. Put it this was if Orpik doesnt fight and Thornton does not throw him to the ice do you not think someone would of had a run at him some time during the game? In hockey it is easier to take your lumps right away rather than lets say wait to get run from behind into the boards. Its all about retribution like it or not it is going to happen. As far as Thorntons actions they had nothing to do with firing up his team or doing his job.If it was he would not of gone after him a second time. He saw a player get hit in a vulnerable position and was pissed,he wanted that retribution. You can be as pissed as you want at the guy giving you the puck but it does not change the fact that lack of respect was at the root of the hit. There are many disrespectful things you can do on the ice that are within the rules."
823116,BillM,2013-12-09 15:39:00,17367,"The root of the hit was the guy skating down the ice with his head down.   If he doesn't do that, he doesn't get rocked.  Why you think that hit was 'disrespectful' makes no sense.   Like I said, would it have still been disrespectful if he just got up and continued with the play?  I doubt it."

The guy was a great defenseman. There's tons of big hitters, the Leafs have had their share. Stevens was just the best at it. Elbows? Show me where he elbows somebody. The guy had 2 elbowing penalties in his entire career. He always tucked his elbow in and threw it out after contact to explode the guy off of himself. Teams used to have to game plan to avoid Stevens' side of the ice in the playoffs, people were afraid to carry the puck across the ice coming into their zone. His hits had a huge effect on the GAME. Besides, he didn't ruin Lindros' career, Lindros did that himself. His concussions started when he got hit by Kasparitis, not Stevens. Guy just couldn't keep his head up."

A player with his head down is vulnerable,regardless of who put him in that position he is vulnerable and open to physical harm. If you respect another player and care about his well being you back off if not you step in hard. And yes if he had skated away it would of still shown lack of respect.

Counting penalties in a league that judges everyone differently is silly. Do you think the refs looked at Gretzky the same way they did Domi? Stevens threw plenty of elbows,you want to see them feel free to search. OF COURSE they avoided his side of the ice for fear of getting decimated.

Yeah your right who needs respect of others anyway. With a bit more respect perhaps Thornton would not of done what he did. Orpik was vulnerable laying on the ice and Thornton cranked him a few more times but that was wrong of course,wasn't it ? You can justify it all you want calling it the good ole big hockey hit. Respect is something that is being drilled into our children in minor hockey.Respect your coach,the refs and of course your opponent. Pick up any OMHA,Alliance or GTHL mag or better yet go to a few coaching courses and you will hear about the whole 'respect thing'. Included are sessions on hitting when your opponent is vulnerable to injury. Have you noticed the stop signs on the back of jerseys lately? Why the emphasis at the grass roots of the game ? The growing lack of respect for others at the upper levels."

He follows him around, slew foots him/pulls him to the ice and delivers a couple of blows to his head when he's defenseless, LONG after the whistle. It was a premeditated and as cheap as they come, had nothing to do with the game of hockey. It went against the ""code"", throw the book at him. All because Orpik threw a clean hit on a player. I guess the NHL is becoming a league of pansies where players can't even throw a hit without worrying about some goon assaulting them. I'm not against fighting by the way, but that wasn't a fight. Anybody who defends Thornton is a moron.Neal's knee was dirty as well, not on the level of Thornton's as it wasn't planned. Just a dumb, careless split second decision by Neal to not try to avoid Marchand. He deserves to sit too, but not as long as Thornton. I wish Neal would smarten up and not be such a sneaky little weasel. He's too good of a hockey player to be resorting to that kind of crap and he's going to get somebody seriously injured if he keeps it up."

822804,irishfield,2013-12-08 03:18:00,26272,For sure Dan... Looks like I get to fish the Ottawa!  ...and we wonder who the real trolls are here in MM's thread.
822805,lookinforwalleye,2013-12-08 03:21:00,4399,Yep another monster performance by the Leafs.
822807,tb4me,2013-12-08 03:24:00,3295,"That was a perfect game..It had everything good in the sport in one game..leaf lead by 2 Sens tie it up. A good fight lots of hits Sens take it to OT, lots of action and the Shootout..Win or loose that was a great game..James Reimer improves to 7-0-0 in Ottawa..with a 47 shot night..Oh ya GO LEAFS GO!No Lupal tomorrow night either..Re Coach Randy"
822808,muskymatt,2013-12-08 03:24:00,2608,Meh!
822812,Richie Razor,2013-12-08 03:36:00,536,Looks like we have an addition to the troll gang here!!!! Hahaha welcome.
822814,DRIFTER_016,2013-12-08 03:38:00,10439,HEY MATT!!!!!!
822815,irishfield,2013-12-08 03:38:00,26272,"Nope, just pointing out who the real ones are. Hey Matt.. .what ramp do I meet you at.... the one beside the church? lol"
822817,Richie Razor,2013-12-08 03:39:00,536, Well deserved too!!!!
822820,fish_fishburn,2013-12-08 03:49:00,1311,"Did I miss something, How can a little poke with the glove on inflict so much damage? Not like he got hit with a haymaker or anything. I bet Orpik will be released and be just fine. Now Neil is going to get a mitt full of games off. That was a real dirty shot. Not sure how you can call the Neil scrap a beatdown he fell."
822830,lookinforwalleye,2013-12-08 04:31:00,4399,Well a 230 pound enforcer lays a couple good shots on a  defenseless player jaw might hurt some! I say minimum 10 games hope it is more...but those Bruins for some reason tend to be able to avoid suspensions.
822831,Nipfisher,2013-12-08 04:37:00,2449,I will say 5-8 games. I don't think he has been suspended before.
822835,darsky,2013-12-08 05:08:00,586,I know its a little early but they sure are playing like champs.  This looks soooooo good   
822868,fish_fishburn,2013-12-08 14:27:00,1311,Orpik has been released from the hospital and will travel with the team. Just what I thought. What a sad excuse for a man he is. More like a drama queen. He should get an extra 10 games for delay of game.
822869,muskymatt,2013-12-08 14:30:00,2608,"LOL any ramp is good, that one is probably my favorite for the fall. Might be a bit tough launching a boat now though lol. But if you want a spring trip, I'm all for that, any time!!  As for the game, I seriously think the brain cramp in Ottawa has hit a high, man they gotta snap outa this. After all, losing to the laffs, man that stings!  "
822870,glen,2013-12-08 14:41:00,2641,If orpik plays his next game then laying on the ice was turning hockey into a goon fest.
822878,fish_fishburn,2013-12-08 15:18:00,1311,Orpik spent more time laying on the ice then he did in the hospital. That's pretty sad when a hockey player fakes an injury like that just to get the other guy suspended. When he plays his next game I bet someone grabs him and gives him a pounding for such fakery. That's embarrassing to all NHLers.
822889,BillM,2013-12-08 16:07:00,17367,"You guys think Orpik 'faked' that?   lol.   Where do you guys come up with this stuff?   I hope Thornton receives a monster suspension, that was absolutely disgusting."
822900,manitoubass2,2013-12-08 16:40:00,11391,
822901,BillM,2013-12-08 16:44:00,17367,"hell get 6 or more for his actions. The knee to marchands head was just as bad imo, if not worse. Hell receive 5 games or less  I agree on the knee as well, that was absolutely intentional..   The next Pens/Bruins game is going to crazy!  The initial hit by the Pens was 100% clean in my books."
822922,tb4me,2013-12-08 18:29:00,3295,
822754,Dan668,2013-12-08 01:07:00,1120,Terrible.  Just seen the boston highlight
822755,Richie Razor,2013-12-08 01:11:00,536,"Yup classless bruin hockey, it's always been that way sadly."
822756,davey buoy,2013-12-08 01:13:00,5505,"Yup classless bruin hockey, it's always been that way sadly. There in town tomorrow,so that we'll be the talk for sure.That game is on Leafs TV at 7pm.Will have to try and catch the pregame."
822757,Richie Razor,2013-12-08 01:23:00,536,Ottawa needs to keep that walrus in check!!!
822759,manitoubass2,2013-12-08 01:30:00,11391,I need to rewatch that boston issue. When grapes showed it i never really seen anything as awful as they portayed it. Did i miss something?
822761,manitoubass2,2013-12-08 01:35:00,11391,Spezza looks like he rode the bike too long
822764,tb4me,2013-12-08 01:46:00,3295,Wow has Liles ever played a good game tonight..Ya think he wants to stay up with the big boys
822765,jedimaster,2013-12-08 01:50:00,3472,"10 power plays tonight. Way too many penalties. Mind you most were deserved. Is spezza and karlson injured? Haven't seen either of them anywhere. Its still early though, maybe they will get off the bench."
822766,tb4me,2013-12-08 01:54:00,3295,"10 power plays tonight. Way too many penalties. Mind you most were deserved. Is spezza and karlson injured? Haven't seen either of them anywhere. Its still early though, maybe they will get off the bench. Spezza just missed the net and nailed Neil on the pp with a wild slap shot.. Way to to Jay! Thanks! Neil is a bum too.."
822767,Richie Razor,2013-12-08 02:01:00,536,Nice mclaren beatdown!!! That what we need more of!!!
822769,tb4me,2013-12-08 02:04:00,3295,Neil needs to go to canadian tire for some new gear after loosing that battle with Mclearen
822770,davey buoy,2013-12-08 02:04:00,5505,Matt is awfully quiet?
822772,tb4me,2013-12-08 02:07:00,3295,"Wow Thornton is a gonner my gues is between 6 and 12 games watch hereHere's the video of Orpik hit on Eriksson, Neal kneeing of Marchand, Thornton taking down Orpik and the KO: What a gutless no brain move http://bit.ly/IyDLwP"
822773,tb4me,2013-12-08 02:14:00,3295,heres a better lookow.ly/rypEY
822774,Richie Razor,2013-12-08 02:19:00,536,Sorry on a tangent; that hunt/Bigfoot fight is on right now channel 509 (Rogers)
822779,BassMan11,2013-12-08 02:24:00,583,I would not be surprised in Neal gets 7-10 games. That was bad. Even though Marchand is a big rat.
822780,davey buoy,2013-12-08 02:25:00,5505,It's the third period guys.Don't count your chickens yet lol.
822781,manitoubass2,2013-12-08 02:26:00,11391,Wow gardiner just sat back and watched the goal. Brutal
822782,Dan668,2013-12-08 02:29:00,1120,Not sure what gardener was thinking. Just let the sen grab the puck.

822792,manitoubass2,2013-12-08 02:59:00,11391,"Give me a crayon, ill draw a penalty"
822793,lookinforwalleye,2013-12-08 03:00:00,4399,"Ya stupid move by Neal and yes marchand is a punk Neal will be suspended for a couple of games and Thornton what a classless move and this from a guy that said in interview recently that he respects the ""code"" but he wears a bruins uniform so we shouldn't be surprised."
822496,John Bacon,2013-12-06 16:23:00,3277,"Yeah, yeah, yeah.....I'm starting to have flashbacks to when I was a laff fan!!  You mean your not one now?  You seem to follow the team pretty closely"

Should be an easy win considering how horrible the Sens are this year.... Looks like Krusty was the driving force behind that sorry excuse for an NHL club!!!
822725,jbailey,2013-12-07 23:22:00,866,"Careful, anything can happen and Matt will definitely never let you hear the end of it haha"
822726,irishfield,2013-12-07 23:26:00,26272,"So Matt.. when they win tonight.. the Sens... does that mean you have to take me out on the Ottawa, or do I have to take you out on Gbay?"

822340,Raf,2013-12-05 19:47:00,3495,bozak out indefinately with oblique strain.. first hamstring now this.  offseason of doobeys and beer resulted in poor conditioning?

822353,BillM,2013-12-05 20:47:00,17367,bozak out indefinately with oblique strain.. first hamstring now this.  offseason of doobeys and beer resulted in poor conditioning?  Too much fly fishing out west

Leafs called up Diamigo and I think they will call up Broll too.So our top 4 lines are centered by Naz Holland smith and Mcclement Ya this is gonna be interesting.....Yikes
822376,davey buoy,2013-12-05 23:26:00,5505,"Interesting,I don't know?,but stranger things have happened.The new guys could just give the extra effort to make their name known.!,We can only go up . Giver guys tonight,we need a win!"

822381,Roy,2013-12-05 23:36:00,13728,"Well, my uneducated opinion for tonight is that the Leafs and the Sens should do well with their opponents. The Habs however are in for a hard time."

822395,muskymatt,2013-12-06 00:16:00,2608,"Hey, it's no secret the Sens have been on the losing end this year so far, that said they are in year 3 of rebuilding. The first 2 years they made the playoffs, so on that, I'll reserve my comments on the outcome of the next 2 games. Oh, and the laffs can't handle any kind of blowing, wind or whatever,  they will just fall and hurt themselves. Poor little laffites."

The first 2 years they made the playoffs, so on that, I'll reserve my comments on the outcome of the next 2 games. Oh, and the laffs can't handle any kind of blowing, wind or whatever,  they will just fall and hurt themselves. Poor little laffites. Your right about hurting themselves.. Yikes when it rains it pours They look good so far tonight..Lots of chances and Brenier looks like he is on his game.."
822402,davey buoy,2013-12-06 00:45:00,5505,"Your right about hurting themselves.. Yikes when it rains it pours They look good so far tonight..Lots of chances and Brenier looks like he is on his game.. Agreed,but they have to try and play 3 periods."
822403,lookinforwalleye,2013-12-06 00:47:00,4399,"Well, my uneducated opinion for tonight is that the Leafs and the Sens should do well with their opponents. The Habs however are in for a hard time. we`ll see Roy...."
822404,jbailey,2013-12-06 00:47:00,866,its usually the last 10mins of the game they need to worry about
822405,tb4me,2013-12-06 00:47:00,3295,"Agreed,but they have to try and play 3 periods. 1 down 2 to go....They looked good this period...lol"

822030,tb4me,2013-12-04 01:37:00,3295,Wow what a turn around..Went away for a few minutes and they look like a different team out there
822031,leaf4,2013-12-04 01:38:00,2466,"weak call on Raymond, that was insane how little contact was made, I've seen intentional swatting that's made more contact to hands/forearms and no call, also look to that play where JVR got hauled down on a breakaway no call"

822035,blaque,2013-12-04 01:48:00,2419,San Jose looked like they were up a man on that one
822053,muskymatt,2013-12-04 03:12:00,2608,San Jose is my 16th favorite team
822056,leaf4,2013-12-04 03:23:00,2466,"Gave them a run for their money, not bad for playing a team like San Jose, I wouldn't of minded if they at least got a single point out of it though haha"
822063,jedimaster,2013-12-04 07:41:00,3472,"Funny how so called sens, habs and apparently bruins fans all watch midweek early in the season leaf games.... the last time I watched a sens, bruins or habs game without the Leafs was... umm... hmm... there must have been one."
822074,lookinforwalleye,2013-12-04 12:16:00,4399,better than watching Real House Wives of New Jersey or Duck Dynasty or some other  show
822077,muddler,2013-12-04 12:32:00,623,Ha ha. I watch what is available. It was a real tough. I was switching between curling and the Laffs game. Same action.
822080,Squid,2013-12-04 13:02:00,1656,Watching the Leafs is ENTERTAINMENT!!
822118,BillM,2013-12-04 17:38:00,17367,"San Jose looked like they had a man advantage the entire game, lol!   Someone needs to light a fire in that dressing room, game after game of flat performances.   Awful."
822121,Richie Razor,2013-12-04 17:49:00,536,"Agreed. Hopefully when they start shooting the 24/7 for the lead up to the winter classic, we'll see Randy just dig into them, cause that's what they need. Right now they sure aren't playing they way they were last year, but I believe they'll come out of it. It's a long season."
822125,BillM,2013-12-04 18:38:00,17367,"I think they've been shooting for a while.   Everytime they lose I'm thinking 'Man, I hope that doesn't show up on 24/7' lol!"
822140,davey buoy,2013-12-04 20:02:00,5505,"The shot count again guys(40),,untill they can get a defence to get it up to the forwards,this looks even worse than I thought (JMO).Every shot on goal can be a potential goal(A lot of you guys don't see this )The goalies are getting tired like we/I thought.This can't go on for very much longer.I still see a further down slide and not getting better for a long while.They need to pound the opposition like they did last season.Untill they get back to that,even with all their players back,it ain't going to be pretty for a while."

I honestly was hoping that he was traded when they said he wasn't at practice..Id let Him and Jake go for a top 5 center. ..For tonight I predict a 5-4 win no Kadri lupal boland and now no fraiser..Were in trouble roster wise..The farm cant keep us in a playoff spot for long....

821483,lookinforwalleye,2013-12-01 03:23:00,4399,Lol...obviously that is the only reason the leafs lost..nothing to do with being out hustled right????

If i was carlyle, id be telling the boys to not worry about winning the next game, just go out for 60 mins and punish punish punish. Play the puck up the boards to the wingers and cycle. But the goal of the game is to punish any opposing player that touches the puck. Just a game to build spirits and momentum, as well as camaraderie. If only it was that easy eh?"

821438,BassMan11,2013-12-01 01:31:00,583,We are getting beat in every aspect if the game. It was a terrible no goal call but we would still be down. We look really bad in the defensive end.

821440,davey buoy,2013-12-01 01:33:00,5505,It's like Randy is holding them back from hitting hard.Last season most teams were terrified to play against the Leafs.MTL is being allowed to have there way.

821448,danc,2013-12-01 01:49:00,4677,I think that Carlyle has totally lost control of this team. What happened to the tough guy attitude that he brought? It's non existant now. There's not one part of the Leafs game that is working right now. They are totally lost out there.

Todays laff facts.  1) The laffs are the only team ever to have not registered a shot in the third period and overtime in the shootout era! 2) The laffs currently have the most shots against per game average in the league. 3) The laffs have allowed 15 GA in the last 3 games, despite fans claims of top goaltending.

I'd be lying if I said I didn't want to see the leafs lose every game in a season, but hate is pretty strong.

The hockey season is filled with ebbs and flows and I'm not one to make a full assessment of the team after 3 losses. Leafs are still way up in a playoff spot, and a few wins here and there can get them back to the top of the standings where they belong.  The key game in all of this is tonight's match-up, lets hope the good guys come out bloodthirsty, and take no prisoners. GO LEAFS GO!!!!!!"

What is sad is that there is a Laff thread here on OFC and you leaf fasn keep it going on and on and on... Why put yourselves through the pain? IS there even a HABS thread on OFC? Does it get the attention this one does??? Its the Leaf fans that are pathetic for supporting such a crappy franchise. Yes the Leafs are 'worth' 1.5 billion but who cares if they cannot win games and make it into the playoffs.

What What's with the credibilty statements? Like you have credibilty BM11? I clearly recall the habs sucking bad ( Like the leafs) in the 80's. The fans stayed away in droves with the forum being half empty. HAB fans expect the best and if it is not delivered then management hears about it period. Yeah all the seats are sold out at the bell centre for 5 yras now but if they suck there will be plenty of empty seats that have been paid for. When it comes to the leafs the fans just go to the games like cattle to slaughter.  I hope Montreal pounds the Leafs ( especially that dirty dude Kadri) back into October on Saturday night.

820706,Stoty,2013-11-27 03:44:00,2910," EXACTLY! Stir the pot then run away, like his Lumberjack buddy Phillis."
820707,manitoubass2,2013-11-27 03:48:00,11391,"Yeah, if only every player in the NHL played with fairy wings on. That would be so exciting!!! Whats next? Asking politely to remove the puck from the opposition players stick while giving him a back rub???"
820710,Stoty,2013-11-27 03:54:00,2910,What the Leafs do behind closed doors is up to them.......
820713,manitoubass2,2013-11-27 04:09:00,11391,
820716,Stoty,2013-11-27 04:20:00,2910,"While they're ""working"" on Saturday... I'll be hammering Quinte gold. Jokes on THEM!"
820717,manitoubass2,2013-11-27 04:31:00,11391,
820723,Stoty,2013-11-27 05:01:00,2910,Haha!  
820732,solopaddler,2013-11-27 10:31:00,8605,"While they're ""working"" on Saturday... I'll be hammering Quinte gold. Jokes on THEM! Bah! Save yourself some gas, launch close to home and practice reeling in a drift sock. Same experience."
820733,Stoty,2013-11-27 11:26:00,2910, Now now...... play nice!
820838,Richie Razor,2013-11-28 01:52:00,536,How bad are the penguins? What happened to Fleury? Leafers are sure looking good.
820839,tb4me,2013-11-28 02:07:00,3295,Wow what a game..Dion could have easily pounded Sid the kid in the face but held back.. Classy move on Dion`s part
820841,leaf4,2013-11-28 02:18:00,2466,haha Sid would've gotten dummied I wish that happened
820842,tb4me,2013-11-28 02:21:00,3295,Wow what a game..Sure is exciting to watch..Coaches dont like it much but I sure do...lol Bozak welcome back dude..Winning key draws and scoring goals..nice
820843,leaf4,2013-11-28 02:25:00,2466,I wonder if fleury will start the 3rd because of that weak last goal
820844,Richie Razor,2013-11-28 02:26:00,536,Same. Phaneuf wouldn't be able to get a punch through without the entire Pittsburg team jumping in
820845,tb4me,2013-11-28 02:28:00,3295,Same. Phaneuf wouldn't be able to get a punch through without the entire Pittsburg team jumping in As sad as that is its true..Yet sid punched Dion in the face twice that I seen..Brutal.. Ill go back to loving Sid the Kid come the Olympics..Go Leafs Go! Go Canada Go!
820847,irishfield,2013-11-28 02:43:00,26272,Sids been a dirty little scum for a long time...
820851,leaf4,2013-11-28 03:07:00,2466,wow they need to pound a few shots at this goalie before the end of the period he's not very strong
820566,muskymatt,2013-11-26 23:32:00,2608,"Agreed, cheap shot in a 6-0 game, slashes the guy and then looks around as if he wasn't expecting the guy to want to fight. It looked like he was trying to get someone to jump in for him lol. Kadri will get pounded sooner or later, either in a fight or skating with his head down, and he deserves it big time."
820578,Dan668,2013-11-26 23:49:00,1120,Crosby does it all the time
820584,tb4me,2013-11-26 23:56:00,3295,"Agreed, cheap shot in a 6-0 game, slashes the guy and then looks around as if he wasn't expecting the guy to want to fight. It looked like he was trying to get someone to jump in for him lol. Kadri will get pounded sooner or later, either in a fight or skating with his head down, and he deserves it big time. LOL deserves what? A possible carer ending blindside hit? Yikes dude the Sens loosing ways sure have made you one miserable beast..So your also saying every player that plays with grit and determination deserves to be almost killed out there? Just like 3/4 of your sens? Brutal.. I honestly dont see a difference between Kadris play and 90% of the rest of the league.."
820590,muskymatt,2013-11-27 00:09:00,2608,"Never said  I wanted to see his career ended. On the contrary, I hope he has a long successful career, just not with the laffs. It was a cheap shot, just like the one that got him suspended, it becoming the norm for him and players remember that. I do have to ask why laff playesr have to swing their stick at everyone and anyone  ? The sens are going through some tough times yes, I watch the games but I don't let it ruin my day or my demeanor. You see, if the sens are losing, I can always flip over to watch the laffs get pounded by Columbus, that is equally entertaining."
820593,misfish,2013-11-27 00:16:00,29133,"The question is,,,,,,,,,,,,,Does Riemer get the start against the Pens?  Big game,Big team.  Ya I watched a double A team vs a house league team. That was the worst game of all the years I have watched the leafs.(Man,Im glad Im a true Bruins fan) but they are my home team. God help me.LOL   Riem needs to be put back in right away. Soft goals ya,but the team in front,OMG PLEASE. That was so disgusting."
820596,BillM,2013-11-27 00:18:00,17367,"Why would they start Riemer?  He had his start yesterday and everyone blew it..  No big deal, it happens..   Start fresh with Bernier tomorrow against Sid and the Pens."
820600,Richie Razor,2013-11-27 00:21:00,536," Ahhhhhh your just sour that he's not a Señorita. After all, your sufferin succotash of a GM wanted him badly in his draft year. He almost begged and grovelled at Burke's feet not to pick him. Pathetic."
820604,Steve,2013-11-27 00:23:00,2075,bernier will start i'm sure.  that was the worst goalie performance of the year.
820605,misfish,2013-11-27 00:23:00,29133,"Why would they start Riemer?  He had his start yesterday and everyone blew it..  No big deal, it happens..   Start fresh with Bernier tomorrow against Sid and the Pens.  Guess you never had to deal with goalies.  Get the confidence back in to the tender."
820606,misfish,2013-11-27 00:25:00,29133,"bernier will start i'm sure.  that was the worst goalie performance of the year.  Ya yer probly right. Got to get their over spent dollars somewhere.  As for your WORST. It,s a team game. Guess you missed the house league team in front of him.."
820608,muskymatt,2013-11-27 00:25:00,2608,"Great, making fun of a guy with a speech impediment. Classy! And we have enough ex laff players with Mcarthur (spl?), oh wait, he's doing awesome and is a plus 10. Maybe if Kadri came to Ottawa, he would develop some class as well. "
820611,muskymatt,2013-11-27 00:27:00,2608,"Yeah, almost rivals that 3rd period meltdown in the playoffs last year!  :clapping:"
820614,manitoubass2,2013-11-27 00:27:00,11391,The sens play hockey? I really thought they were a cycling team??? Perhaps they prefer cardio to playing quality hockey?
820615,Richie Razor,2013-11-27 00:28:00,536,"Actually the entire league makes fun of the guy, even the teams own fans. Sad. I mean how does anyone take that guy seriously?"
820616,Richie Razor,2013-11-27 00:30:00,536,"LOL that so true, after every game the entire team takes a spin class. Must be a European thing."
820618,muskymatt,2013-11-27 00:31:00,2608,"Put down the bong and step away from the keyboard. Really, you'll be better of if you do.  He's one of the most respected GM's in the league actually, but arguing that with a laff fan is futile."
820633,manitoubass2,2013-11-27 00:43:00,11391,
820643,BillM,2013-11-27 00:48:00,17367,"A spin class?  No way, hot yoga for sure"

820651,Richie Razor,2013-11-27 00:55:00,536,"You know what? It makes total sense... Hot yoga, Spezza's girlish giggling, and a loney toons GM. Can I be a fan too please?"
820661,kickingfrog,2013-11-27 01:06:00,8333,"And that folks is why when a child is quiet, you leave it alone."
820663,lookinforwalleye,2013-11-27 01:14:00,4399,LOL sorry Rob I feel responsible for waking him up!  My apologies to all.
820664,kickingfrog,2013-11-27 01:15:00,8333,LOL sorry Rob I feel responsible for waking him up!  My apologies to all.  It's been awhile since your kids were young.
820665,lookinforwalleye,2013-11-27 01:22:00,4399,Yes more than I care to remember!!!!
820671,muskymatt,2013-11-27 01:39:00,2608,"Haha, I love it. You cockroaches have such a holier than thou, self appointed experts approach to hockey that is so comical, seeing as your team has the worst record in the league in the last 48 years. You guys can't even argue with accurate and sensical(ok crotchkey go look it up in your moms dictionary) points, instead relying on typical laff comebacks and theories. LoL. Its so predictable it scary. You're so blinded by years of being losers reality is but a quest."
820299,davey buoy,2013-11-26 00:25:00,5505,"There letting the Jackets have there way with them,what is with this team sometimes????"
820301,leaf4,2013-11-26 00:29:00,2466,what was that they're supposed to build off of the momentum from a penalty
820302,davey buoy,2013-11-26 00:31:00,5505,"what was that they're supposed to build off of the momentum from a penalty Stop them,hold them off!!"
820304,tb4me,2013-11-26 00:34:00,3295,Wow come on boys..Go Leafs Go!
820327,lookinforwalleye,2013-11-26 01:38:00,4399,Wow and Carlye looks like he is about too explode...
820328,glen,2013-11-26 01:58:00,2641,Don't worry the leafs won't get out shot tonight.
820329,DRIFTER_016,2013-11-26 02:00:00,10439,"This has to be their worst performance so far this season. Standing around puck watching, give aways, lack of emotion and no hitting."
820335,Richie Razor,2013-11-26 02:27:00,536,Stopped watching mid way through the second. Worst performance this year for sure. And Lupul injured yet again.....
820336,Steve,2013-11-26 02:35:00,2075,"can someone please tell me what the penalty on phaneuf was for?  i know it was a blown call, but, they didn't even say 'what' it was for?  charge? elbow?"
820341,lookinforwalleye,2013-11-26 02:53:00,4399,On the brite side they were only modestly outshot and didn't give up 40 plus shots....if Reimer would have stood on his head the Leafs might have won this game in a shoot out!!!!! Tough sched coming in early December better shape up.
820347,Steve,2013-11-26 03:00:00,2075,"i'm not going there, but i believe there were only 24 shots on reimer when he got pulled."
820351,lookinforwalleye,2013-11-26 03:06:00,4399,6 goals on 21 shots
820352,Steve,2013-11-26 03:08:00,2075,even better.
820353,tb4me,2013-11-26 03:09:00,3295,Brutal game tonight..The Leafs didnt play their game at all.. Cant win them all but boy did they ever stink the place out...Dion got 2 min for hit to the head..It was a clean hit but the refs are under pressure to penalize if they are not sure..There wont be a suspension..Beauty hit
820355,Steve,2013-11-26 03:11:00,2075,"but he didn't touch the guys head.  100% shoulder.  didn't even brush the guys head.  the ref that was closest to the hit shook his head like ""no penalty"" while the dumbphuk trailing called it."
820356,BillM,2013-11-26 03:13:00,17367,"That was a perfect hit, absolutely nothing wrong with it at all.  Shoulder to shoulder, no head contact, no nothing.   Even the announcers were baffled.   That was about the only highlight however, what an awful game.  Ah well, get that out of the way now, lol!"
820369,muskymatt,2013-11-26 03:52:00,2608,"blah, blah,blah!"
820370,muskymatt,2013-11-26 03:55:00,2608,CBJ's are now my 3rd favorite team!
820372,Freshtrax,2013-11-26 04:27:00,2215,Just got home from the game.   zero level of compete.   I'm glad the tickets were free.
820374,Richie Razor,2013-11-26 04:49:00,536,Sad.
820379,Stoty,2013-11-26 06:04:00,2910,Kadri got pounded......... hee hee hee!!! About time that little sally got what was coming to him.
820403,BillM,2013-11-26 13:23:00,17367,"You call that pounded?  LOL!   Give the kid credit, took a few nice ones to the face and gave it right back."
820439,Richie Razor,2013-11-26 15:45:00,536,"Agreed. Yeah he took a couple shots, but got right back up and seemed like none of the shots phased him."
820541,Steve,2013-11-26 22:54:00,2075,"kadri's a baby.  he'll get what is coming to him.  he's quickly being known as a cheap shot artist in the NHL.  that started with kadri giving a cheap shot from behind, then kadri sticked the guy ... i don't like the crap he does.  someone's going to knock him out .... he'll deserve it ... and hopefully grows up after it."
820560,manitoubass2,2013-11-26 23:25:00,11391,
819938,glen,2013-11-24 05:02:00,2641,As a leaf fan we have enough time loosing that we can complain about. I ain't going to complain when we win. Go Dion.
819941,tb4me,2013-11-24 05:10:00,3295,Wow James Reimer now leads the NHL in save percentage with a.947   Atta boy

819943,danc,2013-11-24 05:13:00,4677,Wow James Reimer now leads the NHL in save percentage with a.947   Atta boy Where are all the Bernier fans tonight? Must be out fishing.... I'd be happier with Scrivens still on the bench.
819944,Steve,2013-11-24 05:16:00,2075,oh i was the first to say good job reimer!  i have no issue with that
819945,glen,2013-11-24 05:20:00,2641,Ya and nice shoot out saves too.
819946,lookinforwalleye,2013-11-24 05:42:00,4399,Wow James Reimer now leads the NHL in save percentage with a.947   Atta boy I call bull on that most of the rubber comes from zero scoring chance zones.....  :rofl2:
819953,solopaddler,2013-11-24 12:36:00,8605,"I call bull on that most of the rubber comes from zero scoring chance zones.....  :rofl2:  Agreed, and exactly why the consistently high shot totals aren't much of a concern."

820106,Richie Razor,2013-11-25 01:20:00,536,The Senoritas are on a permanent Siesta so it seems. I actually totally forgot that they even existed.
820107,Steve,2013-11-25 01:22:00,2075,he's looking for forums with fans of the four teams below the Sens in our conference to chirp.
820127,muskymatt,2013-11-25 02:56:00,2608,"Meh! Ya the Sens are sucking lately (minus the wins against Boston and Detroit), the positive side is they would have to suck for another 47 years to be anywhere as bad as the laffs.  Lots of season left!"
820137,lookinforwalleye,2013-11-25 04:04:00,4399,No new material I see....welcome back.
820187,kickingfrog,2013-11-25 16:25:00,8333,So today Stamcos walks into his press conference without crutches or a cast. Check him for tiger blood.

820210,tb4me,2013-11-25 18:50:00,3295,"  Probably got a rod and screws in there, Dad broke a hip years ago and they had him up right way . Oh ya for sure but being the tibia (sp) bone that beast takes all the body's weight one would think he would have to wait for the bone to fuse.. I hear they are using an air cast and a zero gravity treadmill . from what i understand is they have a plastic tube around the treadmill completely sealed off to his hips.. then they fill the chamber with oxygen. He can then run from anywhere from 10 to 100% body weight..Very cool indeed!"
819629,Raf,2013-11-22 20:19:00,3495, Reimer has been the better goalie.IMO  agree and he's played against tougher opponents to boot.
819634,tb4me,2013-11-22 20:38:00,3295,As grapes said a couple of weeks ago. Coach Randy has completely thrown Reims to the wolves. He has started every game against the top teams in the NHL Bernier get the softer teams... I suppose when you toss the kind of cash at an unproven goalie you wan to see what he has.. i dont get it myself..Optimus for Prime Minister.. lol Kidding of course

Optimus for Prime Minister.. lol Kidding of course Your right,heard the same thing.Reims will be in Saturday I would think. Who's the better goalie so far??I think we all know.Gotta love two good goalies on the same team,but the teams they both play against are apples and oranges different from each other.I'd like to think we all can see that?."
819638,jedimaster,2013-11-22 20:50:00,3472,One thing to keep in mind that often gets overlooked is how often a goalie gets pulled.... I stil like Bernier. The leafs defense have put up some serious stinkers in front of him this year and he still have a better GAA than reimer.

819641,Dan668,2013-11-22 20:58:00,1120,Bernier is definitely better. Can't blame him the team and pk blew it after the first period. Leafs looked like crap. Can't steal every game

819654,leaf4,2013-11-22 22:00:00,2466,Just look at reimers game against Vancouver he was sensational but when your team doesn't do you any favors by scoring or playing stronger defence there's only so much you can do

819893,glen,2013-11-24 00:06:00,2641,Grabo for a hat trick.

819897,davey buoy,2013-11-24 00:15:00,5505,We can beat this team!!!!!Go Leafs Go!!!!!!!!!!  .
819907,lookinforwalleye,2013-11-24 01:01:00,4399,"I think only one of Bernier wins has come against a team with a winning record, came in with a lot of hype at least here anyways for a guy with a resume of 50 career games and I might add not 1 playoff game under his belt. It's obivious the management team had/have limited confidence in Reimer thats why they  went and got Bernier....why they have more confidence in Bernier is a puzzler, The only thing Bernier has proven is that he is human and not quite ready for the hall of fame just yet!!!!!"
819908,Richie Razor,2013-11-24 01:14:00,536,I think you are forgetting that under Wilson Grabo was a real good in the defensive end when it called for it. I hated seeing Grabo leave.
819912,leaf4,2013-11-24 01:29:00,2466,"Phew some tense moments after that goal, I'm surprised it even got reviewed but whatever notch another for clarky!!!"

819916,Steve,2013-11-24 03:04:00,2075,great job reimer!
819917,lookinforwalleye,2013-11-24 03:09:00,4399,Nice to see Reimer get a much deserved win after his mates let the opposition pound away at him to the tune of 50-19....
819918,danc,2013-11-24 03:21:00,4677,Reimer. That's what I'm talking about. I would have changed the channel if Bernier was in net for the shootout.
819919,irishfield,2013-11-24 03:34:00,26272,Jen had an idea.. the goalie should get a bonus when he wins in an out shot game!
819925,lookinforwalleye,2013-11-24 04:16:00,4399,Good idea and the twenty guys that let it happen should pay the bonus.
819927,knightfisher,2013-11-24 04:23:00,237,Great we got another win. But leafs can't continue to give up so many shots.
819933,tb4me,2013-11-24 04:38:00,3295,Great we got another win. But leafs can't continue to give up so many shots. I call Bull on that..The leafs were outshot yes but go to NHL.com and look where those shots came from..35 of those shots were from zero chance areas (from the boards and the blue line)..Its the way the leafs play.The do very well at forcing it to the boards and the outside..I keep saying it but no one seems to see it..Keep going boys your making the goalies job very easy...Its a different kind of D but its working well so enjoy it

They get outshot badly pretty much every game but they have a winning record. The Leafs could have easily popped in 2 or 3 more goals with the opportunities that they had. Last time I checked there are no points for outshooting your opponant. Go ahead and outshoot us. We'll take the 2 points.
819215,danc,2013-11-20 04:22:00,4677,Nice to see Nonis step up and grab a centre to replace the injured Bolland and Bozak. Paid off I'd say.
819223,Richie Razor,2013-11-20 06:04:00,536,Good win for the boys in blue and white. I like this holland kid better than bozak.

819434,tb4me,2013-11-22 00:10:00,3295,GO LEAFS GO!!! Lets get another 2 points tonight boys!
819435,Christopheraaron,2013-11-22 00:17:00,3525,That's a start! Nice shot by Holland
819437,tb4me,2013-11-22 00:21:00,3295,Wow Holland with a beauty..Nice!
819439,davey buoy,2013-11-22 00:29:00,5505,It will be interesting to see who Randy sits Saturday when Bozak returns.Nice problem to have lol.
819440,Richie Razor,2013-11-22 00:35:00,536,Bozak should continue to sit IMO.
819445,tb4me,2013-11-22 00:53:00,3295,"Bozak should continue to sit IMO. I agree, His only plus side was his faceoff abilities, that has also gone now..Never liked him or his new deal.."
819453,Richie Razor,2013-11-22 01:11:00,536,"His new deal is another Jeff finger, Mike Komoserak, JML. Way too much for Kessel's boyfriend."
819455,tb4me,2013-11-22 01:16:00,3295,Way too much for Kessel's boyfriend. Lol I often wonder ya know..But of course its none of our business.. Not like it matters
819457,Richie Razor,2013-11-22 01:17:00,536,Lol
819460,tb4me,2013-11-22 01:21:00,3295,Lol Well hey roommates for the first season seems ok but to live together for 4 or 5 years now?
819464,Richie Razor,2013-11-22 01:27:00,536,"So true....  However my buddy's sister worked at real sports, and said Bozak would always come in with a different chick every week... So Yeah who knows lol"
819465,tb4me,2013-11-22 01:29:00,3295,Man were stinking up the joint now..Bernier still looking solid..Looks like Reims will fave Ovechkin and the Crapitols sat night
819509,danc,2013-11-22 03:59:00,4677,"I didn't see the game tonight but Bernier can't be giving up 4 goals on 28 shots. I know that most of you guys favor him over Reimer, but I'll say it once again that I think that Reimers size trumps Berniers speed/puck handling/rebound gathering skills. Reimer is huge compared to Bernier. Last weeks shootout loss in Buffalo is a good example of what I'm talking about. Two goals where the shooter did nothing more than skate with the puck, pick an opening, shoot, and score. Try to find an opening on Reimer. His size would have at least forced a move. Anyways guys. It's a nice luxury to have. Both are top notch ""Rebels of the Rubber Recepticles"". (Joe Bowen). Let me predict that Reimer will be the go to guy down the stretch. If he can stay healthy."

819549,lookinforwalleye,2013-11-22 14:10:00,4399,This game was the reverse of the year long trend....typically the Leafs throw a measly 20 shots at the opposition net the opposition goalie looks bad and boots a couple and Leafs win.
819609,davey buoy,2013-11-22 19:22:00,5505,"This is not a veteran team at this point.We have a limited few,but for the most part it is a upcoming team that this year I'm sure will and has made too many mistakes.Bringing Bozak in Sat,some say let him sit,others say sit someone else out. This team has potential for sure.But they still have a looooong time to gell if that's the right word?I don't know.I'm sure they will be above a 500 team,but after last night I can see this will be a inconsistent team .IMO.Having said that Go Leafs Go!!!!Looking forward for Sat!"

Out-shot once again, seems to be working..Ill say it again its OK to be out-shot with all the shots coming from the boards and blue line, with goalies like Bernier and Reimer its a good feeling to not have to worry about the net.Thursday should be interesting We get Bozak and Naz back for the Nashville game. I cant wait to see what Carlyle decides to do.. Were fighting Tampa for first with 3 of our top centers out. Go Leafs Go!"

In exchange, Anaheim receives defenceman Jesse Blacker, a 2014 third round pick (it could become a second round pick if certain conditions are met) and Anaheim’s 2014 seventh round pick (originally acquired in David Steckel trade). Holland will report to the Maple Leafs today and Staubitz has been assigned to the American Hockey League’s Toronto Marlies. Holland, a 22-year-old native of Caledon, Ontario, was originally Anaheim’s first choice, selected 15th overall in the 2009 Entry Draft. This season, the 6-2, 194-pound centre played four games for Anaheim scoring one goal and adding two penalty minutes. In 10 games with the AHL’s Norfork Admirals he registered a team leading nine points (five goals, four assists) along with 22 penalty minutes. In 29 career NHL games he has earned five goals, two assists and eight minutes in penalties. Staubitz, 29, played six games for Norfolk this season and tallied 10 minutes in penalties. In 230 career NHL games with San Jose, Minnesota, Montreal and Anaheim, the 6-1, 207-pound native of Bright’s Grove, Ontario has registered 21 points (10 goals, 11 assists) and 520 penalty minutes. Blacker played five games for the AHL’s Toronto Marlies this season collecting one goal and four penalty minutes. He was originally selected 58th overall by the Leafs in the 2009 Entry Draft.  "

818376,jbailey,2013-11-14 04:41:00,866,it did look like he got a bit high but i still think it was a soft call
818378,Dan668,2013-11-14 05:12:00,1120,Pretty soft. It's what hockeys becoming
818380,Richie Razor,2013-11-14 06:03:00,536,"Goalie was out of the crease, kadri nailed him, this is how it should be. The 2nd hit was perfectly clean, just ridiculous officiating.  He should get no games."
818428,kickingfrog,2013-11-14 17:35:00,8333,"The call on the hit at the end of the game was pure fiction. The league knows this and that's why Kadri is only before the league on the running into the goalie. Yes, the goalie ""sold it"" but you can't run into the goalie like Kadri did."
818435,jimmer,2013-11-14 18:27:00,2730,Kadri lifted his elbow ever so slightly to the goalies head. The slow motion video is a killer to players in this situation. I can see him getting a few games. Hope not though!
818447,davey buoy,2013-11-14 20:52:00,5505,"I'm thinking one,because of the early goalie hit.Other then that he might of got away with it."
818449,kickingfrog,2013-11-14 20:54:00,8333,The league is only looking at the running the goalie.  Edit: Not sure were the bold text is coming from?
818450,kuhaman,2013-11-14 20:55:00,503,Looks like he's gonna be out tomorrow night. Who they gonna try at center next?? Rob Ford
818452,jimmer,2013-11-14 20:58:00,2730,"The more they try to make things safer, the more injuries there seem to be. It's almost like a police state where every little thing is under a microscope. I guess it keeps people in jobs that review these cases. I can see no contact coming and the end of our great game."
818454,kickingfrog,2013-11-14 20:58:00,8333,Looks like he's gonna be out tomorrow night. Who they gonna try at center next?? Rob Ford Right up the middle.
818455,davey buoy,2013-11-14 21:07:00,5505,"If he gets a game or two,that just means instead of 38-21 shots against per game ,maybe 43-19.Not much to worry about .  .Things are far from getting better IMO."

Go Kurt! I'd probably think the same if my driver wasn't JJ. I started watching NASCAR in JJ's rookie year and I picked him as my guy since then. Just saying that I'm not a band wagon jumper.I got lucky. And I'm having fun with it.

Both guys went down a few feet from the boards. My brother's leg flew out from under him and his foot hit the boards... snap! Tibea (SP) snapped. He went to get up, but his foot just dangled there... that's when he knew he was in trouble. The human leg is designed to carry weight vertically, not designed to handle horizontal stress. It was pure agony for quite a number of months... it didn't help that he had a newborn at home at the time. We now call him ""frankenlegin"" as he has scars up both sides of his leg, where they put steet support rods to hold his leg together. Yes, he's playing hockey, skiing etc... but it was well into a year before he could get back to work and few more before he played hockey again. HH"

817715,danc,2013-11-10 03:36:00,4677,Disappointing to watch u guys drop one to the hated bruins I really didn't expect them to win tonight. They had the busiest pre season and start of the season schedule than any other team in the league. Combine that with a 6 day lay off and some injuries and I'd say that they looked pretty good tonight. I still say that Reimer is the go to man in net. Bernier might look a little more polished but Reimer is twice the size of him and that right there is huge. There was two guys laying on top of Reimer on the winning goal. The schedule should settle down now in the Leafs favor. Stay healthy and the Leafs should be ok.
817720,jbailey,2013-11-10 06:50:00,866,"i wouldn't blame their loss tonight on the preseason haha and i guess it would be mixed views on how a 6 day lay over would play out... could be a good rejuvenation period -- i wouldnt say the schedule is going to settle down in their favour, just need to tighten up the D and everything should work out well for them"
817757,BillM,2013-11-10 17:20:00,17367,"I liked how they had some offensive zone pressure on Boston, win or lose they played a way better hockey game then I've seen them play this year.   Really missing Bolland out there, Boston is exactly the type of team where you need a guy like that."

He's listed as out indefenitely.Clarkson getting looked at by a trainer right now. Appeared to favour left leg/foot.Clarkson has his helmet on and now back on the ice after getting looked at for about 5 min. Going to give it a go it appears
816758,kickingfrog,2013-11-04 19:40:00,8333,Smaller side tendon (stability) is better then the bigger achilles (power) but it still going to be a while. Any talk about a private investigator?

He is definitely a huge asset to them in my eyes"
816197,kickingfrog,2013-11-01 20:21:00,8333,I don't think performance bonuses are allowed any more except for entry level/rookie contracts.

816215,kickingfrog,2013-11-01 22:04:00,8333,I should have been more accurate.  From the league's site:  PERFORMANCE BONUSES What players may earn in performance bonuses? Performance bonuses will only be permissible for the following types of players: (1) players on entry-level contracts; (2) players signing one-year contracts after returning from long-term injuries (players with 400 or more games who spent 100 or more days on injured reserve in the last year of their most recent contract); and senior veteran players who sign a one-year contract after the age of 35.

Emery who let in 4 goals on 15 shots in 22 minutes of hockey, amidst a 7-0 loss, is officially the 3rd star on the league's web site.

My dad flew out to Alberta Tuesday morning and we took in the Leafs vs Oilers. Great game and surprisingly an equal split of fans in the stands.  Then Wednesday we road tripped to Calgary to watch the Leafs vs the Flames. Way nicer building and way closer game.  Experiencing both games would have been sweet enough as is, but having my dad fly out and getting to do the road trip with him defiantly makes the experience that much more memorable.  I think he had a good time too, he keeps saying now how it has to be a yearly thing."

DanC knows a good defenceman. I assume that you're referring to Dion, Glen? As most of you know, I met him and spent some once in a lifetime quality time with him. Sure, he's not the best defensive defenseman. But there's a reason that he is near the top of the league in ice time every year, under both Wilson and Carlyle. He obviously has offensive skills and gets caught up ice at times. That should be addressed by the coaching staff. Someone has to cover for him when he's up on the play. What we don't know is how much of a team leader is he in the dressing room. I assume he's pretty good in that department too. I know that he was very well spoken when I talked to him. Not 20 minutes before we chatted, he was in a meaningless scrap with Horton of the Bruins ( who left the ice with a bloody nose/face). We talked in depth about his reluctance to fight, and of course it made sense. It was a priviledge to be talking to him about this one on one in the Leafs dressing room while a hoard of reporters waited outside the dressing room door on a hockey night in Canada game, to talk to him about the same thing. Bottom line is that I may be predjudiced Phaneuf fan, but I I think that the Leafs will be a much lesser team without him. They are a fun team to watch and they have lots of potential to make a run, and losing Dion at this point will not serve them well."
816027,manitoubass2,2013-11-01 01:16:00,11391,"Dion has been making some real good offensive moves this year! I think thats awesome as it creates havic for the opposing team. But the team does need to back him up when he rushes. The leafs d imo, only need to be stronger up the boards in their zone and let the wingers make a play. If they can do that, the defense will improve dramatically. And send down ranger, he is clearly a liability"
816046,Dan668,2013-11-01 02:03:00,1120,A friend of mine off the Marlies says Dions his favourite.

As with any team that is winning, almost everyone looks better then when the team is loosing. He eats up the top/tough minutes most nights.  Having said that, I wonder what he might, as an expiring contract, garner in the trade market as part of a package? I like selling high.  As much as I feel he is a very needed D man I don't like the idea of him getting anywhere near 7 million dollars a year or a 7 year deal that has been rumoured."

Dion is not worth 7 mil and especially for 7 years, I sure hope they learned from their past mistakes. He's already slow, what will he be like in 5-7 years. He does log a lot of minutes though."

815801,Steve,2013-10-30 22:13:00,2075,Reimer looks so bad...yet saves the shots.....  Hopefully Bernie steps up tonight.  We need him. Reimer won't get us too far.
815804,BillM,2013-10-30 22:20:00,17367,Reimer looks so bad...yet saves the shots.....  Hopefully Bernie steps up tonight.  We need him. Reimer won't get us too far.  You care how he looks when he saves 43 shots?
815813,jedimaster,2013-10-30 23:00:00,3472,Reimer's problem is consistency. If he is on he is great if not he gets owned. The leafs defense needs a guy that will play solid game in and game out. Reimer has yet to prove that. I don't think anyone can say for certain who is better but to be honest as much as I like Reimer I would have to say Bernier is the better goalie.
815816,BillM,2013-10-30 23:16:00,17367,"We haven't seem Reims have a consistency issue yet this year though..   It's way too early in the season to start complaining about the goalies, lol."
815817,davey buoy,2013-10-30 23:24:00,5505,"We haven't seem Reims have a consistency issue yet this year though..   It's way too early in the season to start complaining about the goalies, lol. Your right Bill,we should be happy we have the two of them playing well right now,not who's better."
815825,jedimaster,2013-10-30 23:43:00,3472,Thats the thing its too early to judge what two relatively unproven goaltenders are going to do long term. We have limited info on both guys accept for what we have seen. Thats all I am basing things on. When I watch Bernier play he looks like a better goalie than Reimer. Thats all. Who knows what 50 games will prove or not prove. My guess though is that if Bernier continues to play solid Riemer will be trade bait when the time comes.
815827,BillM,2013-10-30 23:44:00,17367,"Having to pick between two #1 goalies is probably an issue all teams in the NHL would want     I love the way Bernier plays, I do prefer his style over Reimer."

815561,Paulus,2013-10-29 16:53:00,522,"Let's not count out Reimer just yet. Bernier has yet to play a full season in this league, and he's getting the chance now; can he remain consistent? Rand Carlyle's got everybody pegged on this one, when he says we all want to ""annoint"" Bernier as the starter - nobody really knows yet how he will be at the 40 or 50 games-played mark. With Reimer, you know what you're getting - and it wasn't that long ago that we were all annointing ""Optimus Reim"" as the uniquivocal Savior of Leafs Nation (which I think he may still become).  p.-"

I wasn't disappointed as the Sens looked good and didn't let the opposition score for the whole first minute and sixteen seconds of the game!!! They would keep up the terrific play for the rest of the game and only let the Sharks score 5 goals. On a more sour note the Sens did manage to score 2 goals.  Silly Sens, wins are for Leafs!!!!!!"

815445,davey buoy,2013-10-28 20:01:00,5505,"Geez,I liked how he played that game,but against Columbus?He's cold,but against Pittsburgh hot?.He needs to be a lot more consistent and get away from the two foot shuffle when he has to get moving.I don't think he's going anywhere."
815448,leaf4,2013-10-28 20:30:00,2466,I agree he's got to be more consistent but if he can play like he did against Pittsburgh game in and game out it would be a massive improvement and the way I see Phaneuf right now is still working on his transition from being a bang and smash defender like how he was encouraged to be under Ron Wilson with the whole 'run and gun' mentality that we now see Gardiner trying to shake off and conform to a more defensive minded playing style that Carlyle preaches
815450,blaque,2013-10-28 20:44:00,2419,"ya, it's unfortunate that lindy ruff was fired for a bad team build by regier.  BUT, his days are numbered as well.  Agreed on the Lindy point. Hes coming back to town tonite as the Dallas coach, first time back since he was let go. I expect a standing ovation when he comes out to the bench tonite, at least i hope so. He was quite the staple here for a loooooong time. Win or lose, he was a Buffalo guy  Darcy on the other hand....., i believe he was the one who should have fell on the sword."
815451,misfish,2013-10-28 20:46:00,29133," Yup,he is And he will only get better. If the leafs could just get the shot against down,I think they have the best two goalies in the NHL. At this rate,their going to get shell shock. But they both seem to like getting peppered. Keeps them in the game."

Instead of rolling around on the ice for 5 seconds after you make a stop, get yer butt back up on your skates!!!!  It's pretty simple, go down, get up.  Bernier does this. Goes down and pops back up to his skates.  Flailers don't cover much of the net while they're doing the worm on the ice."

Credit goes to the Blue Jackets, they played a pretty good game.

Clarkson didn't light up the scoring sheet but his presence was noted. And I think that Reimer is #1 in the Leafs camp imho. And for the guys harping about getting rid of Phaneuf, watch the little things that he does. He doesn't lead the team in ice time for nothing."

814919,Raf,2013-10-25 01:15:00,3495,Got 2 games I can watch here tonight. The Calgary game and the Edmonton game. Both could be pretty good games. Guess I'll be flipping back and forth.  Pretty POed that TSN is now charging $10/month for TSN-JETS.  I've ditched cable altogether and got gamecenter live.  every single NHL game this year streamed online for 100. (I stream to a Ps3 hooked up to my bigscreen) there are very simple ways around regional/national blackouts.  hockeystreams.com is another option but from what i understand the quality is not as good and it's a bit (a lot) more grey market.

Personally I'd say no loss to any Winnipeg games.... The franchise has lost it's luster already for me, they need to simply win.  Game Center I think doesn't black out any games so maybe I will go with it. Center Ice does blackout regional games ie Those shown on Leafs TV.   Center Ice blacks out games in my local viewing area. I will not be able to see TSN-JETS, SNET-W, SNET-CGY or SNET-EDM. All nationally televised games on the big networks BC, NBC, NBC Sports Network, NHL Network, RDS and TSN are also blacked out."

Since neither has won the cup in that time span I would say the only fair comparison between the two teams would be there playoff records against each other.  Do we have to do this again? Ok, here it is.  The Sens haven't been in the league 48 years, they came in for the 92-93 season. So lets compare the stats from then. Or do you want to compare against other teams who weren't in the league like the Moosejaw marauders again, cause I'm pretty sure you have them beat seeing as they don't exist!   #1) SENS  14 out of 20 playoff showings(didn't qualify 1st 4 seasons back in league) Conference champs 1 time Division champs 4 times Presidents trophy 1 time Stanley cup finalist  1 time  #2) laffs  1 division champ 11 out of 20 playoff showings    So, now we can do the math  add #1 and #2 together  1+2= laffs suck!!

814244,Richie Razor,2013-10-22 01:32:00,536,"I think what the leafs are missing is a guy like Leo Komorov, how effective was this guy down the stretch last year? There is no one on the team that just goes out and hit guys and plays a solid defensive game, hopefully Clarkson sparks some guys with his play when he comes back this Friday.  Another note, Mclaren may make his debut as well on Friday!!! Can't wait for the Leafs to bring the fists back into the equation, which is another large missing piece of their game that made them so effective last season."

813891,Rod Caster,2013-10-20 11:40:00,5784,"Ok, no more leaf talk.    Mike Smith gets a goal for the 'Yotes! Obviously that isn't a good barometer for how talented a goalie is, but that guy has been a lifeline on that team for the last two years! Go 'Yotes, Go Jets."

Were I the GM, i'd be looking for a stronger D man to pair with phaneuf than gunnarson."
813111,jimmer,2013-10-16 15:02:00,2730,Ph-enough stinks.I think that guy just can't make up his mind when he has the puck in his end. Yet they still win???? Go Leafs Go!
813112,BassMan11,2013-10-16 15:03:00,583,"Well after sleeping on lastnights win  i have some thoughts..We played well..I honestly think that were a top 6 team league wide. The Leafs have elite special teams were sitting 3rd on pp and 3rd on pk.so far this season.Were down 4 of out top forwards right now too.Should be an interesting next few months..3 games till we get our future team Caption, David Clarkson back. Go Leafs Go! I am a die hard Leafs fan but I would have to disagree. Yes we are playing well now, yes we look very good offensively, and yes our goal tending tandem is much improved. Lots of good things to look forward to. But when our best D-man right now is a 19 year old... that is a bit of an issue. We can't be out shot every game all season and expect to keep winning. Saturday night will be a real test of what we are made of. That being said, it is a great start to the season and hopefully we can keep rolling.  Go Leafs Go"
813116,blaque,2013-10-16 15:42:00,2419, The Sabres don't have a team this year. They just won their first game tonight. Now they have a whopping 3 points.  Gonna be a LONG season down here in B-Lo  
813121,Headhunter,2013-10-16 15:56:00,5703,"Anyone who thinks this team is going anywhere givin their current play, is delusional. The Leafs have be fortunate to have the record they have. Goaltending has been their saving grace. Without it, this thread would be far more interesting. They have played one teamso far this year, that has been on a roll and Patty Roy's team made us look pretty bad. Agreed that Saturday night's game should be a decent barometer for this team. On the up side, if they simply play .500 from here on in, they should make the playoffs. However, as far as I can see, they are only one or two injuries away, from being in some trouble. HH"
813123,tb4me,2013-10-16 16:05:00,3295,"Se now im a glass half full kinda guy..Once we get our full lineup back its a different story..Phaneuf is an issue thou..He looked like he was wearing 60 pound lead skates last night..As for now were down Clarkson, Mclearen and JVR there is someone else too but I cant remember who. Right now our special teams are top 3 guys..Thats with the Marlie go round lineup we have had so far this season..I see a real good team here..A different team from last year too..Who do we play on Sat? I cant wait to end this west coast games run.."
813125,BillM,2013-10-16 16:09:00,17367,"Offense definitely isn't the problem, getting out of their own zone has been.   So many stupid give aways and bad clearing attempts..  If they don't fix that, they aren't going anywhere."
813131,Richie Razor,2013-10-16 17:06:00,536,I'm a big fan of Levio and Broll hope they can both stay up with the big club when Wendel Clarkson and Frazor Mclaren come back.... But who else do you send down? Some tough decisions are to be made.....
813134,BillM,2013-10-16 17:11:00,17367,"Yup, I'm really liking the talent they are bringing up from the Marlies.  Good kids, hate to see them sent back down but a taste of the pros will just get them hungrier!"

813156,davey buoy,2013-10-16 19:25:00,5505,"I agree ,we were lucky to win that game with all the penalties.Defence sucks,let's face it.As said this team cannot carry on with a 30 plus shots against every night.The goalies can only win so many games.Phaneuf IMO is far to slow and not consistant at all.Nonus must address this sooner than later. I also agree in Chicago Sat will be there first real test. Let's concentrate on the defence.Two veterans imo,don't know how they will do that,is needed now!!!If not I think were in for a nose dive soon."
813157,tb4me,2013-10-16 19:27:00,3295, Chicago. Yikes! But im actually really looking forward to that game now..Lets see where we stand against the defending champs..Im also looking forward to Pittsburgh and Washington games too!

813240,manitoubass2,2013-10-16 23:49:00,11391,Clearing the zone is our biggest issue imo. The wingers should move up higher on the boards and the d needs to stop playing the puck up the boards softly. Thats where all those turnovers that lead to shots are coming from. Blast the friggen puck up the boards and trust your wings to make a play or touch it and get it deep. Just my 0.02 (armchair coach lol)
813345,jimmer,2013-10-17 17:49:00,2730,"ahaha best phaneuf description http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJH-CMnA7PI   That's funny. Maybe Burke will take Phaneuf back now that he's with Calgary. I know he isn't the GM, but I'm sure he has some pull. They should definitely reduce his ice time if they can't trade him, I think he does better with a limited role. Hopefully Mark Frazier cames back soon."

812995,kickingfrog,2013-10-15 22:59:00,8333,The two teams that have played for Ottawa are not the same. The sens can claim those cups all they want. It doesn't mean they earned them. Montreal only claims cups won by their franchise not by other teams in the city. What's next? Will the New York Rangers claim the cups won by the Islanders? Or vice versa?  That is the inconvenient truth.

Leave it to laff fans to compare their teams stats against the stats of a team that wasn't in the league for 80 years, now that's classic Laffite reasoning!  Hey, I guess you have the Moosejaw Marauders beat then too eh?  And the Yellowknife Yellow snows??  Heck they weren't even in the league, or existed, but you've got them beat!  "

Get a life, better yet get a team with some leadership, and a fan base that really doesn't care about their team. Actually, as a life long leaf fan, I find MM's comments not only hysterical, but also generally very truthful. Sure he takes his shots, but I also think most folks get that it's just ribbin and they don't take it personally. Others could learn from that. RE the game last night... it was like watching two junior teams; with the team that made the last mistake, losing the game. Sure was entertaining, but I think the Leafs have alot of work to do, if they think they are going to be contenders. HH HH"

I bet they can't wait to get back home.  I'm sure they are licking their wounds and will be a snarley bunch once they get a reasonable schedule going."

812131,manitoubass2,2013-10-11 00:20:00,11391,Its tough to tell though. Im sure its crazy hard to be elite when facing 40 shots per night. He might be a starter for a good strong defensive team? Never know till we see it i spose
812135,leaf4,2013-10-11 00:35:00,2466,"Omg hahaha, they are really playing ""the fox"" by ylvis during one of the tv timeouts, when it came back on I could still hear a good 10 seconds of it, absolutely hilarious. on another note, this arena sure in quiet compared to the ACC"

812145,Raf,2013-10-11 01:07:00,3495,looks like carlyle read em the riot act and they're listening playing a good road game with nobody to impress. really playing tight in the 1st period -- minimal turnovers and good defensive coverage  they miss fraser on the backend and it will be interesting to see what will happen with the d when he comes back.  will they keep reilly and bench gardiner/ranger or send reilly back down
812155,leaf4,2013-10-11 01:22:00,2466,"definitely missing fraser, this game needs a fight to pump some air into these guys.  they score twice then fight that's what I'm talking about!!!!"
812160,kickingfrog,2013-10-11 01:45:00,8333,There you go. One team goes up 2 goals and it's time to fight. That's the Bull that this game doesn't need.
812161,Steve,2013-10-11 01:58:00,2075,disagreed.
812162,leaf4,2013-10-11 02:01:00,2466,"unless someone does it will forever be a part of hockey whether you love it or hate it, it takes a dull game and breathes fresh air in and gets the adrenaline pumping, rallies the guys to push harder for a goal for that guy, the enforcer"
812163,kickingfrog,2013-10-11 02:08:00,8333,Ya the last 10 minutes of the leafs habs game was great after paros hit his chin on the ice and all those playoff games without fights are so boring.  There is a huge difference between 2 guys fighting because they are mad at each other and this sadly predictable our guy (who can't skate) against your guy (who can't skate).
812165,leaf4,2013-10-11 02:24:00,2466,"that was a freak accident and not caused by the actual fighting itself but a result of the tripping, and holding of the sweater by Colton Orr after he went down"
812169,lookinforwalleye,2013-10-11 02:50:00,4399,So who won the game?
812171,kickingfrog,2013-10-11 02:52:00,8333,4-0 Leafs.
812172,kickingfrog,2013-10-11 02:54:00,8333,Of course the fact that mm wasn't commenting the second the game was over would be a clue as to the result as well.
812173,pidge,2013-10-11 02:58:00,438,Nice earned win tonight. To many shots though. Geese 36. That's too man. Ass kickin comin this Saturday for the Oilers. There's a head scratcher of a team. Detroit lost as well 4-2. Tonight's a good night

That's because I was rewinding that hook and punch to the back of the head that lead to the 3 on 1 trying to figure out how they missed the penalty. Then I noticed the brown envelope in the reffs back pocket!  Laffs looked soft and weak, it's only a matter of time till they crash. Other than the Sens they haven't played against a contender or playoff team yet."
811784,BillM,2013-10-09 04:27:00,17367,"ranger sure was terrible!  definitely not sold on Toronto's defense...  Yeah, he keeps making mistakes...  I won't be surprised to hear he's been sent down."
811838,lookinforwalleye,2013-10-09 14:36:00,4399,Well not really surprised he was mediocre with Tampa a few years ago.
811852,muskymatt,2013-10-09 16:23:00,2608,Ranger looked perfect out there to me! LoL I hope he keeps up the good work.

811997,BillM,2013-10-10 12:15:00,17367,"i'd rather tie than the possibility that a teams fate is decided at the end of the season by trick shot.   nothing worse than two teams playing a helluva hockey game and deciding it like that.  Yup, its silly.  In the end it's about individual play instead of a team effort.  I wish they'd get rid of the shootout entirely."
812016,tb4me,2013-10-10 14:12:00,3295,"I enjoy the shootout..We all did it as kids, except it was called a penalty shot..Come on how many times were you Wayne Gretzky or Mario Lemux busting down the point for the big shot to win the cup..Thats why the shootout exists..Childhood memories..Now it actually means something...Seeing as how this is a Sens threadIts about time Bobby Ryan did something, I have him in out OFC pool here..Finally a Sen I find useful..."

812043,BillM,2013-10-10 18:00:00,17367,I've got a feeling Reimer won't be sticking around too long.
812062,jbailey,2013-10-10 19:29:00,866,"a shootout makes the 3 periods essentially a waste of time, the game is resorting to a talent show. You could have a team full of fancy players getting out played by a bunch of 3rd liners to keep in the game then it gets decided by a shootout! I don't mind a tie, I'd prefer OT until someone wins but the TV networks can't handle that and I'm sure many of the viewers that are not avid fans will stop watching at a certain point."

I agree as well,play till someone gets two points!One point each is bull imo.I'm sure as you say the networks probably couldn't handle the crossover/shows coming on in there time slot."
812090,leaf4,2013-10-10 22:09:00,2466,"I disagree although I know Reimer won't like being a backup, but if you can split those games over an 82 game season 50-32 or something like that I think it can give them a serious goalie tandem but who knows maybe Reims can pull out a couple of big games and be on top again"
812092,davey buoy,2013-10-10 22:13:00,5505,We need a back up for sure.I just have a good feeling about Bernier already.As said Reimer will get his time .Having said that do you think there is a market as a starting goalie for him at this time ?.Interested to hear anyone's opinion.
812095,leaf4,2013-10-10 22:27:00,2466,"It'd be interesting to see him as a definite #1 but it is very hard to say that time is now, goalies age differently and it seems they're at their best and most consistent at around age 30, when was the last time a young goalie came in and made waves? you never hear about any depth in net in terms of drafts. Ed belfour was an undrafted signing when he first started in the nhl all those years ago in Chicago and he's one of the best there ever was so it really is a tough call when trying to gauge the pedigree of a goaltender who is 25"
812101,kickingfrog,2013-10-10 22:46:00,8333,"And Chicago traded Hasek (who wasn't young at the time) away because they were going with Belfour.  Straight up, goalies are weird.  More of the game is between their ears then any other position in hockey. The smaller equipment might also mean some of those goalies who just positioned themselves and shrug their shoulders will not be looking as good this year.  I'd rather the leafs stay with the combo they have now and unless some team is desperate through injury or another crisis the trade value isn't that high anyway. Cap wise, these 2 goalies fit and after this season make the decision for the next 4-5 years."

I play net thanks!....  haha just playing but I do play net, always during any sort of tourney or playoff I have to get in my zone first, and usually I have to take a leak and I just seem to play better, don't ask I have no idea haha but yeah, definitely need to get into a mode I usually just sit in the room after I'm dressed and just relax try and not too think too much. It's always nice to have a league keep your stats too, always in playoffs I play better (or maybe my defence does) regardless in any of my winning years in rep or houseleague staying in the zone is key, when you're on you're on and don't change a thing!"
812108,kickingfrog,2013-10-10 23:12:00,8333,"Some will say goalies are ""different"". That's slightly nicer than weird and way nicer then most of the things hockey players will say about goalies."

If that were true you wouldn't all be posting on this one... this is a leaf thread!  and jokes aside, they are a team i cheer for as well (when they aren't playing the sens)...  the only organization i despise is the habs."
811552,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2013-10-07 23:52:00,0,i'd rather tie than the possibility that a teams fate is decided at the end of the season by trick shot.   nothing worse than two teams playing a helluva hockey game and deciding it like that.

811410,jedimaster,2013-10-07 11:29:00,3472,this thread has officially gotten boring. Once again hockey talk has been overshadowed by the juvenile delinquent sens fan. Its a shame people can't enjoy hockey and talk hockey. I would think that if a musky thread was as laiden with the insults and meaningless interjections from non musky fans the thread would be locked or posts deleted. I am all for joking around and good fun but is it not possible to have a thread where fans can interact with fans and not people whose sole intent is to try and cause fights?  I guess not.

810679,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2013-10-03 02:37:00,0,"good game by the buds. as i mentioned earlier, i think the leafs have all the offensive pieces in place.  not sold on on the D quite yet.  dion and gunny aren't a top pairing on a championship team IMO. i do think the leafs are solid enough that they will be a buyer at the deadline, and a better dman paired with phaneuf would rectify any perceived weakness i'm predicting.  interested to see what my sens do this year.    i think macleans puck possession domination is going to pay big dividends with the squad he's got.  we've got some work to do on cowen and wiercioch, and if ""Oh No"" Joe Corvo ends up being shakey we have some guys ready to make the jump.  i still think we're a season or two from a run, but i like where the team is going"
810680,irishfield,2013-10-03 02:37:00,26272,"Yah,,, but Montreal is full of one way streets and it's a set route down there!"

810682,muskymatt,2013-10-03 02:42:00,2608,"I see a quick out of the gate,  a fizzle and then a collapse equal to a certain playoff game last year. Defence is weak, won't be long before it wears on the forwards."
810683,Raf,2013-10-03 02:45:00,3495,"thankfully matt, the things you see, such as orr 'intentionally' pulling parros down last night, are pretty far removed from reality."
810687,manitoubass2,2013-10-03 02:57:00,11391,"Muskymatt forgot to mention the leadership in ottawa lol. Is spezzas grit and raw emotion for the game gonna take you anywhere? That being said, im a realist, leafs got outplayed tonight but pulled off a win thanks to a few good plays and outstanding goaltending."
810699,jedimaster,2013-10-03 11:51:00,3472,"The reality of last night games is that bernier stole that win. The could have been down 4-0 after the first period. We have been waiting since cujo for a solid goalie that can steal 10 wins per year. Guess what. You just saw that goalie last night night. I am a Reimer fan but he is no where in the same league as bernier. I was hoping to keep scrivens as a a backup as I am not sure how much Reimer will want that role. None the less this is going to be a very good pairing. The defense is very suspect so far in the two game plus the pre season. If gardiner and rielly pan out they will make a huge difference on the blue line. Looks to me like the goaltending has been sorted. The offense with kadri, kessle, bolland and jvr has been sorted. Special teams is on the upswing. They just need to work on gaining control in there own end 5 on 5. Happy Leafs fan today."
810701,BillM,2013-10-03 11:55:00,17367,"Bernier was calm, cool and collected lastnight.  He definitely stole that one for the Leafs..   Nice to see the boys turn it around a bit in the 2nd and 3rd periods with some offense."
810708,lookinforwalleye,2013-10-03 12:53:00,4399,Wow...he proved all that in one game...impressive!!!! LOL
810718,dave524,2013-10-03 13:50:00,4508,"Looking at the games stats , I saw Reimer got the #1 spot of the three stars of the game opening night, Ok with that, but then last night I see Bernier listed as the 3rd star with Troy Brodie and Braden Schenn as the first 2 stars, do the guys that pick these stars even watch the game"

Bernie definately got the W for the buds, but it was Bolland who found himself at the right place and right time to net a couple and win it for the goaltender.  When Clarkson comes back, and if him and Bolland pick up the points, the parade will be going South, against traffic, on Mimico Avenue boys lol."

No hockey expert would ever say he is one of the most complete players in the game as you have proven by stating he is.  An argument could be made that in one half of the ice Stamkos is one of the best players in the game. I would counter that he not enough of a passer to qualify as the best, but I would listen.  He is a star. He is someone who sells tickets (not in Florida). He is the type of player any team would want to have. He may play a key role in the Olympics for Canada. He is, however, not a complete player. It is unlikely he ever will be. That's not a knock on him, just on anyone foolish enough to try to declare that he is.  Maybe if you spent less time figuring out how to come up with put-downs worthy of a school yard hair pulling fight you understand things a little better.

810240,DRIFTER_016,2013-10-01 14:41:00,10439,I do!!! I care deeply. I hope they meet the Leafs in the playoffs again so they can lose to the Leafs yet again.

Hmmmm..... have watched all the 2013-14 season expert summary shows on TSN, Sportsnet, etc....and their view was the Leafs wouldn't make playoffs. They thought ((the experts) Sens would make playoffs and some had Sens as sleeper team to make Stanley cup final.  I don't care though was born and raised in Montreal. Think Montreal has won 7 cups since Leafs last won one. hehehe....."

Its just so easy to ridicule the laffs because they suck so bad. And the fact Ottawa will make the playoffs again and did 12 of the last 14 years gives a  bit of confidence"

However, I went to the Sabres game last nght and was pleasantly surprised with the turn out, and the atmosphere for a pre-season game.  It was quite full, with a decently competitive game going on.........and got to watch the new kids dangle a little. Heck, there were even sections of Leafs fans shouting ""LETS GO LEAFS"" obnoxiously  You guys must really like it down here to show up when your teams not even on the ice lol"
809572,DRIFTER_016,2013-09-26 16:31:00,10439," Leafs were off last night. They are Canucks and Canucks like hockey. Doesn't matter where, if there's a game going on we're there.  I have tickets to watch Tampa Bay in March while on vacation. I'm going to the game on the 8th against Boston, the 17th against the Canucks and the 24th so I can heckle the Sens!!! OH, and tickets are cheap down there so I'm sitting in the 4th or 5th row visitors end top of the circle for all games. In TO you would need to sell your first born for these seats!!!!  :rofl2:"

Stop crying about the Leafs and just watch the octopus hit the ice when Alfie scores a hat trick against the Sens. I guess it's hard to talk about the Sens when they don't do anything remotely interesting. The only way for you guys get on Sports Center is for a fan to clone your coach. Kind of sad.... The Sens will never have a following like the Leafs. Get over it.  Go Leafs Go!"

809740,DRIFTER_016,2013-09-28 00:07:00,10439,HAHAHA!!! Seems Alfie's new fans hate him too!!!! They were booing him on the PP. LOL

809783,muskymatt,2013-09-28 14:43:00,2608," No, actually it was the laff fans booing him once again. Another team and still the same reaction from the cockroaches  . But then he almost single handedly killed the laffs. Seems Alfie could go to any team and still beat the laffs.  Looking at the top teams in the Atlantic division, it appears the laffs are in for a tough year.  El predicto says ""another year no playoffs for you laffites""  "
809291,blaque,2013-09-24 20:37:00,2419,"Actually, it looks like kessel flapped his gums and then raised his hand toward Scott first.  Silly little troll  I think Scott new he wasnt going to get to Kessel, just made a grab toward him and was glad to deflect to the first leaf to intercept him. Im sure he was glad he couldnt get to him uncontested, that would have been awkward for him (scott) to have to go full beat down mode on phil in front of the hockey world lol.  Scott may have looked silly with the attempt to grab him. But IMO Kessel trumped that with the baseball swings at Scotts ankles from outside the scrum as Scott is preoccupied with 2 guys on him. And then later comin in to poke him again. Hes askin for a whoopin. Of course thats just my opinion. ANd my opinion would be the same if it was Ennis from the sabres behaving the same with Orr.  It all evens out in the end.......I say good for Buffalo for being on the other end of the conversation for a change."

809303,tb4me,2013-09-24 21:54:00,3295,Kessel gets the rest of the preseason off..No regular season games..!! I knew Shanny was a smart man..Buffalo's coach Ron Rolston fined for player selection and team conduct..Thats more realistic..On another note..As for the Clarkson suspension The Leafs had home ice advantage.. The puck had not been dropped yet. We have the last line change..I would totally appeal this big time. Oh wait the PA already is.This is why he (Clarkson) is so quiet right now... He may too beat this and I hope he does..He didn't jump off the bench to fight he left the bench to break up a scrum..AKA line change...lol
809306,tb4me,2013-09-24 21:59:00,3295,"thought this was funny as anything Leaf hockey..lol (Scene: A boardroom in a downtown skyscraper. Brendan Shanahan sits at one end of a long table, preparing for the hearing. After shuffling a few papers, he's ready to begin.) Shanahan: OK, first up we need to hear from the Maple Leafs. Send in Phil Kessel and Randy Carlyle. (Phil Kessel walks into the room.) Shanahan: Uh, where's Randy? Kessel: Oh, he's on his way. (Carlyle, sprawled out on top of a fainting chair, is carried into the room by several MLSE interns.) Carlyle (with the back of his hand to his forehead): Fighting! Enforcers! Oh the humanity! However could an NHL team do such a thing! Shanahan: Uh, Randy… Carlyle: Won't somebody please think of the children! Shanahan: Good try, Randy. Carlyle: Not buying it, eh? Shanahan: Not especially. Carlyle (getting up from the fainting couch): Want to fight about it? Shanahan: Maybe later. But first I want to talk to Phil. Phil, you're here because you slashed John Scott twice. It sure seemed like intent to injure. Let's start with the first slash, how can you justify that? Kessel: Before the faceoff, John Scott told me he was going to attack me. He's much bigger than me and has far more experience fighting, so I felt that I needed to take action to protect myself. Whether it's on the ice or on the street, a person in imminent danger of being assaulted has a right to self-defence, and so I did what I had to do. Shanahan: Hm. That's pretty convincing. Kessel: Thanks. Shanahan: And the second slash? Kessel: Oh, I was just trying to break his ankle. Shanahan: Ah. Kessel: Seriously, screw that guy, am I right?  Shanahan: Well, I appreciate your honestly, even though you probably just extended your suspension by another game. Kessel (under his breath): That's the last extension I'll be getting in this town… Carlyle: Wait, what? Kessel: Nothing coach! Shanahan: Phil, if you could just sign your statement, we're done here. (Shanahan hands Kessel a pen. Kessel starts to write, then pauses to shake the pen.) Kessel: It's out of ink. Voice from outside: DON'T WORRY PHIL, I WILL SAVE YOU! Kessel: Oh Christ. (David Clarkson bursts dramatically through the office's plate glass window.) Shanahan: The door was unlocked... Clarkson (striking a heroic pose): No time for that now. PHIL KESSEL IS IN TROUBLE! Kessel: Actually, I can just get another pen, Dave, it's not really a big deal… Clarkson: MUST PROTECT PHIL! Kessel: No, actually, the situation is completely under control and… Clarkson: WE'LL GATHER THE TROOPS! STORM THE INK FACTORY! THERE WILL BE BLOOD AT DAWN! Kessel: Randy? Carlyle: I'm on it. (Carlyle pulls out a long vaudevillian cane and slowly reaches for Clarkson's neck.) Shanahan: Cool cane. Kessel: Thanks. We just had it made. Shanahan: OK, now it's time to get the Sabres side of the story. Send in John Scott and Ron Rolston. (Rolston enters the room, wheeling a large crate. He smashes the crate's lock with a sledgehammer, and John Scott emerges.) Shanahan: John, why don't we start with you. Can you explain your actions leading up to the altercation? Scott: (staring straight ahead) Shanahan: John? Scott: (grunts) Rolston: Yeah, he's not much of a talker. Shanahan: I'm getting that impression. Rolston: Oops, almost forgot feeding time. (Rolston tosses an oddly shaped slab of raw beef in Scott's direction.) Scott: (unhinges jaw; devours slab whole) Shanahan: Was that a human femur? Rolston: Don't you worry about what it was. Carlyle: Completely disgusting. You ought to be ashamed. (Takes out a notepad; writes ""Reminder to self: Feed Orr/McLaren."") Shanahan: OK, well let's move on to you, Ron. You certainly seemed to be sending a message by having Scott on the ice. Given the situation, why leave him out there? Rolston: I realize it may have seemed over the top. But I'm the coach of the Sabres now, and I have to respect the fact that Buffalo fans prefer a team that plays rough. Shanahan: They do? Rolston: Oh sure. Every fan I talk to is always saying stuff like ""We love rough"" and ""This team was way better in the rough days"". Shanahan: Um… Rolston: Or ""I can't believe we fired rough and hired you, oh man our franchise is so screwed"". Shanahan: Right. Rolston: Come to think of it, that last one doesn't even make grammatical sense. Shanahan: You keep working on it. By the way, is he OK? (Shanahan looks over at Scott, who is gnawing on the boardroom table.) Rolston: You're going to want to avoid making eye contact. Shanahan: Thanks for the warning. OK, our next witness is… wait, that can't be right. Tyler Seguin: Hey guys. Shanahan: You have nothing to do with this case. Seguin: Sorry. I'm legally mandated to show up at least once in every Phil Kessel story. It's a Toronto bylaw. (From the street below, a tour bus with a hot tub on the roof begins honking its horn impatiently.) Seguin: So, are we almost done, or… Shanahan: We're getting there. Seguin (noticing Kessel): Oh, hey Phil. Kessel: Hey Tyler. How's Boston? Seguin: Actually, I got traded this summer. Kessel: Oops. Now I feel kind of awkward. Clarkson: I WILL SAVE YOU FROM YOUR FEELINGS, PHIL! Kessel: No, David, it's fine. Look, just take a deep breath and think about what you're about to… Clarkson (flips the boardroom table): YEEEARGHH! Shanahan: OK, I think we need to wrap this up. Does anyone have any final statements they want to get on the record? Rolston: No. Kessel: Nope. Carlyle: No. Scott: I've just always found that any discussion of justice is complicated by Plato's Euthyphro dilemma, which states that if we are to have independent moral standards then some actions must be right or wrong in themselves independent of a higher authority. Kessel: … Rolston: … Shanahan: … Seguin: Ah, but then you'd be ignoring Swinburne's response that contingent moral truths cannot be denied without inherently contradicting… Scott: (immediately uppercuts Seguins' head, which explodes) Shanahan: OK everyone, thanks for coming. I'll release the video announcing my decision once I've taken my medication to remove all traces of my personality. You can all leave now. (Everyone begins to file out.) Shanahan: Oh, by the way, you'll have to take the stairs. The elevator is being repaired. Carlyle: Wait, you mean there's an open elevator shaft just down that hallway? Shanahan: Yeah. Carlyle: That's an incredibly dangerous situation! (He thinks for a moment.) Carlyle: Phil, you go. Kessel: Dude… Clarkson: FEAR NOT, PHIL! Kessel: David, I'll just take the stairs… Clarkson: I'LL FIGHT YOU, GRAVITY! (Clarkson hurls himself down the elevator shaft.) Clarkson (voice fading as he plummets): I REGRET NOTHING…. Rolston: OK, now is this over? Shanahan: Now it's over. Rolston: Completely over? Shanahan: 100%. Done. Finished. Everything has been resolved, and the situation is absolutely and completely over with. Rolston Which means... Shanahan (checks watch): Any second now… Jonathan Bernier: Hey, anyone want to fight?"
809314,jbailey,2013-09-24 22:42:00,866,"as a hockey fan in general, the entire thing was pathetic, hard to place blame or defend individuals actions, not so black and white"

809318,Gallie,2013-09-24 23:11:00,1215,I love hockey and i like the leafs. I find your generalization of leafs fans offensive(squid) I do not like kessel but i think the first slash was justified. The rest no i also dont care for phaneuf either. I just want them to play meaningful games in the spring for a change. I dont understand what upsets you so much??? Do you like the raptors or something??? By the way my wife has a cat named squid who has six toes. I dont like him either have a nice day sir.
809319,kickingfrog,2013-09-24 23:24:00,8333,I'm sure Kharlamov thinks Bobby Clarke is a real tough guy.  As much as the incident was a gong show (for today's standards) it is nothing compared to the early/mid 80s stuff and the 70's is on a whole other level of stupidity.

809350,tb4me,2013-09-25 02:05:00,3295,That was an ok game..The leafs did good.. Reims looked solid again..Its to bad the game winning goal was kicked in the net..No video replay in preseason otherwise we would have had OT at least..Oh well leave it to the sens to kick it in to win....
809352,muskymatt,2013-09-25 02:27:00,2608,"  You crack me up, the Sens(PRAISE SPEZZA)  and their B squad made your laffs look like amateurs.  Out shot, out played, out scored.....Reamer(intentional misspelling)  made it a game, good luck to him to repeat that effort all year. The laffs are doomed"

Oh yah and it's preseason.. oh yah and musky matt if you are so excited about a preseason won the Leafs are 3-1-1 I am happy with that record thus far having lots of youngsters in the lineup."
809369,glen,2013-09-25 06:01:00,2641,Tb4me thank you for tears of laughter.   I like the part about Scott being in a box.
809399,jbailey,2013-09-25 13:59:00,866,that game was atrocious
809475,lookinforwalleye,2013-09-25 22:18:00,4399,"I wonder if Scott would have gotten a 3 game pre-season slap on the wrist if he had slashed and speared Kessel?  The suspension is a joke especially the way Kessel has been swinging his stick lately, should have been a regular season game or two!!!"
809520,jedimaster,2013-09-26 02:22:00,3472,"I think the league made it loud and clear with what went down how they view it. 1) Clarkson no brainer, don't leave the bench. 2) Buffalo should have never have had Scott on the ice by giving the coach a fine. 3) You don't break the Code of Goon fighters going after skilled guys. 4) Slap on the wrist for Kessel just because yah you don't do that but clearly no harm was done and clearly was done in self defense. See point 3.  Having said that I would have been ok with Kessel getting a 1 or 2 game regular season suspension. That kind of slashing is just not cool.  As for what would have happened to Scott. I can almost guarantee had Scott got hold of Kessel and pounded on him and Clarkson not jumped in off the boards Scott would be out for a long sit down re point 3."
809526,DRIFTER_016,2013-09-26 03:23:00,10439,How about that Karlsson fella in tonight's game against the Habs. Decided he was too tired to play the third period. Probably spent the summer on the couch eating bon bon's and poutine!!!!  The Sens are DOOMED!!!!!   :rofl2:  Golf sens golf
809123,fish_fishburn,2013-09-23 18:04:00,1311,I think theres also a code about carrying your stick around like Kessel does. superstar or not you use your stick like that and your just the same as everyone else. Kessel should of shown he has balls and just grabbed him and held on real close. The linesman would of been there to bail him out in a second.
809142,mattybculp,2013-09-23 19:17:00,388," Easy for you too say sitting on your couch, You ever fought a guy who had that much of a height and weight advantage over you on skates? Oh and not too mention earns his paycheque from scrapping. Didn't think so. Arm chair quarterbacks are my favourite, would love see your ""balls"" when put in that situation. (but I really don't wanna see your balls). But don't worry the linesman will be there to bail you out in a second."

809233,fish_fishburn,2013-09-24 14:06:00,1311,"Can tell your a true Leaf fan Matty, but at least your smart enough to agree that the linesman would be there in a second to bail me out. Can tell you one thing. In 40 yrs of playing hockey I have never used my stick like that. I guess its because I do have a set of balls not like the little pansy Kessle."
809234,BillM,2013-09-24 14:28:00,17367,Grown men comparing themselves to Phil Kessel... I think I've seen it all now!
809235,BassMan11,2013-09-24 14:32:00,583,I think people need to relax about the Kessel stick swinging. If you have played hockey for 40 years I am sure you have slashed someone in the shin pads and seen things a lot worse then that on the ice. Lets be realistic here. Now if he would have slashed him in the head or even the body... then I would have a different opinion. All in all it wasn't that bad... but he will probably still get a game.  As for Phil being jumped by Scott...... I'll tell you one thing... if someone did that to Dougie back in the 90's....... Wendel would have been coming over the boards just like Clarkson.. except it wouldn't be to break up the fight.
809236,BassMan11,2013-09-24 14:43:00,583,"Just in case you missed it I think the point is fighters aren't ""supposed"" to jump the other teams star players. Your Welcome"

First time offender and all..Just my opinion.. Funny thing is Clarkson is still allowed to play in the preseason..His 10 game suspension doesn't start until the regular season..Interesting to sat the least..Here is a theory for you to think over..When suspended his salary still effects the cap. Now lets say that he twists his ankle tonight and goes on the IR for I don't know lets say 12 games (insert evil grin here)  then his salary doesn't count towards the cap hit..That would free up a little extra cash for Franson.Now to top it all off the PA is doing some sort of appeal on the Clarkson suspension..Re the code and he needed to be out to defuse the situation..Love the NHL
809247,mattybculp,2013-09-24 15:33:00,388, 40 years of Friday Night mens league or house league experience doesn't count

Its almost like the leafs organization sends out talking points to all the leaf fans so they say the same thing over and over again..."
809251,BillM,2013-09-24 16:24:00,17367, You sure you're not talking about Sens fans?  It seems that the only thing they talk about are the Leafs
809253,tb4me,2013-09-24 16:28:00,3295,See that's what I find odd..Honestly I have never been to another teams fan site so I don't know what goes on over there..However I suspect that its very much the same..If those teams had as big of a fan base..Sens Red Wings Buffalo none of them have a real fan base as the Leafs do..SO why not start a thread boosting your own team? Honestly you would never see me on the forums of your favorite team blasting them..Your all closet Leafs fans and that i cant help..But seriously we don't talk any higher about out team then any other fan does of their respective team in  any sport..Of course we think were going to win the cup..that's what being a fan is all about..Perhaps you guys should spend more time on your teams fan sites supporting them..As a real fan should do.. So it comes down to 2 possibilities here..1 either your a closet Leaf fans or 2 your jealous and want to come here to flame us real fans..Go support your team and allow us to enjoy ours...
809274,kickingfrog,2013-09-24 18:53:00,8333,In an unprecedented move the league will punish the Sabres by making them dress Scott for 10 games and he must play a minimum of 10 minutes a game.

809284,Squid,2013-09-24 19:38:00,1656,"Really?? Thanks for the Tuesday funny tb4me. Oh and I hate the Sens to boot. And other team fans do go on forums and bash the team. This goes on everyday so maybe you are not looking hard enough. ""Toronto is the shrine of hockey"" the holy GRAIL!!!, is that not what Laff fans say? This is why so many other NHL teams fans bash the laffs. All the fans think that the Leafs are gods gift to hockey yet the reality is that they do suck and have sucked for a long long long time. Now that they made the playoffs for the first time in 8 yrs the belief in leafdom is that your team is going to the cup and will win the division along the way. if I could hold an intelligent coversation with a Leaf fan it would a cold day for sure. I bash my own team that I support. I am a hockey fan a hockey player and still play to a high level to this day. A true hockey fan will clear all of the bias that clouds the judgement and have an intelligent conversation about a game.  I have yet to meet a leaf fan that feels this way. The Leafs can do no wrong. look at the comments on this thread; If kessel had two handed me in a game he would be going off on a stretcher the next shift out. That is so bush league and he has a propensity to do this year in and year out. There is no denying that he is a cheap shot artist. Mention this to a leaf fan and right away they turn it around and deflect it back with comments like what about this guy or that guyor this team or that. No accountability on the part of leaf fans when it comes to their team.  TRUCULENCE was the buzzword with the Leafs last year, what will be the new motto this year?"
809285,davey buoy,2013-09-24 19:45:00,5505,"TRUCULENCE was the buzzword with the Leafs last year, what will be the new motto this year?   Go Leafs again Go Leafs!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!lol."

809037,lookinforwalleye,2013-09-23 02:55:00,4399,Can't really blame Kessel  for swinging his stick I am sure when Scott came at him he prolly pooped his pants.
809038,danc,2013-09-23 02:58:00,4677,"That's the second, or possibly the third time Kessel has tomahawked someone this preseason. I'm a big Leafs fan, but that isn't right."
809041,Richie Razor,2013-09-23 03:04:00,536,"Scott would have literally killed kessel if he got ahold of him, a couple slashes to the shins is deserved by that goon Scott. Mad respect for Clarkson for protecting the teams best player, sucks he'll get 10 games though. Oh well, what an exciting game!!!"
809042,jedimaster,2013-09-23 03:06:00,3472,"Goons have a place in the game, but that place isn't going after the stars of the game."
809043,lookinforwalleye,2013-09-23 03:09:00,4399,Makes you wonder why the Leafs didn't  have one of their goons in the line up to counter act Scott.  And just wondering why Kessel was lined up against Scott anyways was Carlyle sleeping?
809044,glen,2013-09-23 03:11:00,2641,Well you can't have Scott killing kessel. Why was kessel lined up against Scott right after a fight?  Leafs need to protect there stars.

809062,Stoty,2013-09-23 10:37:00,2910,Kessel got a match penalty so he's also suspended.
809081,bobogo,2013-09-23 13:42:00,76," I've never see orr and mcclaren go after another team's star like that. Maybe a hit on the ice but no where near grabbing the guy and trying to fight him. So yea. They aren't goons, scott is worst than one."
809086,BillM,2013-09-23 13:56:00,17367,"6'8 trying to fight Kessel, lol that's awesome.   I seriously crack up anytime I see Kessel swing the lumber on the replays!!!!"
809091,tb4me,2013-09-23 14:28:00,3295,I both agree and disagree with this comment..Your right he should have stayed on the bench but he seen his top line getting jumped by a super goon.Clarkson is going to have the C by this time next year..He is a team player and it just proves his loyalty to his teammates..I wish he didnt do it but im happy he did...
809093,jedimaster,2013-09-23 14:41:00,3472,"Think about it in terms of any team. Imagine Chara going after Spezza, or Probert after gretzky or.... the list goes on. Carlisle said that he was trying to diffuse the situation by putting out the kessel line he had no idea that buffalo would stoop so low and go after him. Just crazy on both sides."
809096,kickingfrog,2013-09-23 14:53:00,8333,"Havn't seen the crap from last night but if the league continues to leave it to the players to take care of things, ie the code, then small guys like Kessel will continue to use their stick like an axe.  It's not right, but that's the way it is.  On a slight tangent: Some of us here should remember a ""tough guy"" from the 80s and 90s that made sure everytime you tried to hit him clean you had to go through a crosscheck or his elbow."
809098,jedimaster,2013-09-23 15:30:00,3472,Just imagine if Kessel threw up an elbow every time someone came near him. He would for one be in the box the whole game and two be labeled as a cheap shot artist. The game isn't the same now.
809101,glen,2013-09-23 15:54:00,2641,Carlisle caused the problem by putting kessel out there.  Come on Carlisle show us you know how to coach. Carlisle better get a grip on when to put people on the ice.

809108,muskymatt,2013-09-23 16:24:00,2608,Now why would Kessel use his elbow when he has a perfectly good stick to use as a weapon?

809114,muskymatt,2013-09-23 16:57:00,2608,It was just announced by ESPN that the Ottawa Senators have been rated as the number one sports team in Canada. Tsn has said the laffs will not make the playoffs.  LoL
809115,Dan668,2013-09-23 17:04:00,1120,Lol survey which means nothing. Ottawa cant even fill their own building. More leaf/habs fans than the senoritas.
809116,kickingfrog,2013-09-23 17:14:00,8333,"Ah the fallacy of the code. Fighters don't fight non-fighters and goons don't go after the talent. The Sabre's coach needs to answer for his responsibility.  Kessel will get something for the stick work although what else do you do when someone who is 12 inches taller and 90 odd pounds heavier then you drops the gloves and tries to go? Clarkson left the bench, that's pretty cut and dried.  We all know what would have happened if Randy had sent out his big guys. He tried to end it by sending out obvious non-fighters (the code) and the Sabres didn't care. This was all after there had been a fight and one player was concussed after hitting his head on the ice.  This is preseason."
808955,kickingfrog,2013-09-22 23:23:00,8333,"The rules are not open to assumptions. Other rules of the game have been relaxed for shootout attempts with the league's blessing.  The kicking the puck into the net rule is held up as a rule to protect players (Completely incorrect btw, but that's not the focus here). No player's safety was endangered during the play.  Again we are talking about an unsuccessful shootout attempt during the preseason."
808968,jedimaster,2013-09-23 00:04:00,3472,"Most people that have played the game especially goalies have levered pucks off there shin. To add a clear cicking motion at your stick seems pretty clearly defined as kicking equipment. I see no such mention of the kciking of equipment refering to items on the ice. The rule simply states one cannot kick a stick equipment at a puck. Seems pretty clear to me. Of course anyone can take something for the way its written or of course make up whatever add on's they want. We certainly see that with the fishing regs all the time. haha Anyway, it would be interesting to see what ruling would be if something like that happened in a real game."
808970,kickingfrog,2013-09-23 00:07:00,8333,Agreed. ..And it goes in.
808981,jedimaster,2013-09-23 00:53:00,3472,"Yep, breaking bad starts in 10 minutes... can hardly wait. I was pleasently surprised to see reimer holding his ground on the shootouts though."
808984,kickingfrog,2013-09-23 01:32:00,8333,Apparently the goalies went at it tonight with Bernier doing his best impression of Potvin laying a beatdown on Hextall. The best part is Miller was playing the part of Hextall. I'll need to watch Sportscentre later.

809017,jedimaster,2013-09-23 02:31:00,3472,Too bad Orr and Mclaren wern't in the lineup. Scott is a foolish goon. There will be some suspensions for sure. Kessel will likely get one and if he does he deserves it.

808945,kickingfrog,2013-09-22 22:54:00,8333,I'm not trying to be argumentative here but if we are going to look at the letter of the law then I'll contend that the shaft of the stick is not the blade (which the rule specifically mentions) and that he levered his stick against his shin to propel the puck rather then kicked the puck.
808949,manitoubass2,2013-09-22 23:12:00,11391,"Frig, kf knows everything about hockey lol. I don't know how many things I've learned on here about hockey from kf hahaha"
808950,jedimaster,2013-09-22 23:12:00,3472,"He clearly with a kicking motion kicked the shaft of his stick propelling the puck towards the goal. The rul doesn't explicitely say only just that ""This includes"". It does however explictly state ""kicks any equipment (stick, glove, helmet, etc.)"" Last I heard the stick is the stick. Seeing as how its not possible to kick the shaft and the blade its reasonable to assume that kicking the shaft is considered kicking the stick."
808954,leaf4,2013-09-22 23:20:00,2466,when it's referring to those items it means the items are off of the player and items on the ice

808577,bobogo,2013-09-20 11:41:00,76,"So yea, I predict the leafs to do pretty well this season. Kadri should be ok, and back to scoring in the regular season. Glad to see David Bolland get that gaem winner eh. And waht about.... WAIT, this is the SENS thread? OPPS. Too many leafs fans here I thought it was leafs thread!  "

808595,muskymatt,2013-09-20 14:18:00,2608,Nice new GTA arena complex going up in Hamilton I hear. All privately funded. Looks like Toronto will get a team after all lol

808610,Richie Razor,2013-09-20 16:25:00,536,"Lol, Hamilton will never ever, EVVVEEERRR get a NHL team. Can't believe this is still debated to this day, it's like people never been to Hamilton present day.  The leafs are going to kill it this year, simple as that. They have an even tougher team, and their offence is primed for a breakout season. Plus they have guys on the farm that are ready to be called up.....  And Ottawa? With last nights lines they put out there (excluding turris and cowen) they played horrible. Why do they have that useless lug Kassian still on the team? Sorry, was Bobby Ryan playing last night or was he in the press box with Turris? Didn't hear or see much of him or his linemate Spezza.... A weak team with absolutely no leadership, and don't tell me Spezza is a leader b/c he clearly is not, and has never been. Didn't Anderson get hurt last night as well?"
808617,muskymatt,2013-09-20 17:24:00,2608," That statement alone verifies that you are a delusional laff fan, and all of your other comments are not to be take seriously!  Dream on Laffite"

Kadri looks like he is getting better ..Goal a game so far for him this preseason.

808624,jedimaster,2013-09-20 18:13:00,3472,ROFL... how did you enjoy that game seniorita fans?
808625,lookinforwalleye,2013-09-20 18:14:00,4399,Anderson played way over his head last year I look for him to come back to earth a bit.
808626,Richie Razor,2013-09-20 18:20:00,536," Same thing for Subban, and Markov is due for a season ending injury. First to last I say for MTL this season. ... Not as bad as the Sens though.... They'll be so bad this year Eugene Melnyk will offer Leaf fans and Canadien Fans special promotions to keep them in the building for other home games."

No matter, as you will see the Canadian Tire Center will be sold out (as usual) for every game, including the playoff games.  What are playoffs you laff fans ask?  Silly laffites, you have to get there first to know.  Maybe you can ask your granddad what playoffs are!!  "

808510,BassMan11,2013-09-19 20:58:00,583,Of course you will sell out now that you can pay in Canadian tire money to buy tickets.
808515,Richie Razor,2013-09-19 21:35:00,536,"The Sens have real fans??? LOL Now thats a good one!!! Is that why when the Leafs come to Kanata the arena is 3/4 all Leafs fans, with ""Senators Fans"" even selling there tickets to Toronto Fans?? I believe it got so bad last year that Eugene Melynk threatened Sens season ticket holders to not sell them to Leaf fans??!?!?!? Yeah buddy, some fan support you got there.   Sorry, I also had to add in what happened last year when the Leafs came in to destroy the pathetic sens;    Did you happen to forget about this?"
808517,muskymatt,2013-09-19 22:11:00,2608,Do I really have to remind you what happened to the laffs in the playoffs last year? The greatest playoff meltdown in league history! As in EVER! REMEMBER THAT? BWAHAHAHAHA

807344,jedimaster,2013-09-11 18:40:00,3472,I say good on him for getting what he did. I would have rather signed him long because I believe in two years he is going to cost far more. Let the puck drop.

807385,kickingfrog,2013-09-11 23:02:00,8333,Hodgson signs for 6 years at 4.5 per. More risk than Kadri's but in the long run might save Sabres some cash.

807496,jbailey,2013-09-12 15:12:00,866,"He was holding out for too much not really having played enough games... although I will say atleast watching Kadri can be interesting, not like the pylon Phaneuf who couldn't hit the net if his life depended on it and turn down potential momentum shifting fights... or Kessel stepping over the blueline and taking a wrister from the top of the circle... ugggh"
807501,Richie Razor,2013-09-12 15:33:00,536,"Although Kadri didn't get what he wanted, I bet he'll play with a chip on his shoulder all season, which will be good for the leafs. This kid plays like Dougie G."
807615,Sebastian,2013-09-13 03:25:00,208,I'm not sure who you are watching but Phaneuf is a top 10 defenseman in the league with points and goals. Kessel has been the most consistent point producer on the team. I don't understand why they are constantly being thrown under the bus.
807618,Stoty,2013-09-13 04:23:00,2910," Umm, not sure what stats you're looking at but he's only been in the top 10 for 1 of the past 5 seasons....which just so happened to be the shortened/modified season...."

808086,Stoty,2013-09-17 02:58:00,2910," I acknowledged him making the top 10 last season ""he's only been in the top 10 for 1 of the past 5 seasons...."" but having one decent (half) season... doesnt mean your a ""top 10"" guy in the league."
808091,tb4me,2013-09-17 03:06:00,3295,"Great game tonight..Clarkson , wow this guy plays with heart..Jake looked awesome and Kessel played the tough guy role..lol 8 min in the box tonight..Cant wait for the next set of cuts.."
808093,Stoty,2013-09-17 03:15:00,2910,"Clarkson is a STUD. Can score goals and isnt afraid to mix it up! Phil, is a SALLY. Two hands a guy three times and cross checks three times, but runs away when confronted."
808099,kickingfrog,2013-09-17 03:37:00,8333,And that ^ is coming from a dead things fan. Page #1 of their play book.

I get the whole ""he isnt a fighter"" thing, but if you're gonna intentionally try and injure someone by giving them three two hands plus three cross checks then you better be ready to defend yourself and not just run away."
808103,Stoty,2013-09-17 03:43:00,2910,"Considering the success that Det has had..... maybe the Leafs should be taking more ""plays"" from their ""playbook"". Just sayin'...."
808108,kickingfrog,2013-09-17 03:57:00,8333,I guess some people don't like behind the play cheap shots (page #2 of dead things play book) from plugs in preseason.
806634,solopaddler,2013-09-06 16:46:00,8605,You still praising Alfie Matt?
806638,DRIFTER_016,2013-09-06 17:44:00,10439, Darn right he's going to score 50 goals for er against the Sens this year.
806654,Jds63,2013-09-06 19:57:00,1365,  right on !!!! the Leafs give up Tuuka Rask for Andrew Raycroft and all you guys can talk about is how Kadri is not worth it  ?  besides Lupul and Reimer he is the only shimmer of immediate talent the Leafs have If he settles for a 1 yr with less money he can walk at the end of the season and there will be lots teams willing to pay up.
806658,muskymatt,2013-09-06 20:40:00,2608," You can't argue with the fact he gave it his all while he was here. I think both sides dropped the ball during the resigning negotiations, it definitely could have ended better. That said, Alfie made Ottawa his home for 17 years, was excellent with the community and doesn't owe us anything. I wish him all the best and will fondly remember all the good times. I look forward to the day we see his number in the rafters. I'm also happy all the laff fans will now be booing Detroit, at least until the end of the regular season, at which point the laffs will be riding the pine again!"
806666,glen,2013-09-06 21:34:00,2641,I hope the leafs don't screw this up.  Already started to.  What's the going rate for him with a one year contract? Rob you there?  I want to watch the best team play.
806675,kickingfrog,2013-09-06 23:18:00,8333,I haven't been following it too closely but I think it is a least as much about term as it is about the per year dollar amount.
806686,jedimaster,2013-09-07 00:58:00,3472,"This whole Kadri thing is more about Bob Mackenzie shooting his mouth off about what he thinks the offers have been versus what they actually have been.  I haven't seen any information from Kadri nor the leafs what the offers have been.  I can't see whay anyone would put fault on a guy for wanting term in a deal.If you think he isn't good enough to play for the next 5 years then trade him. If you do get  some value for him. The reality is the leafs have two guys worth more than the 5 mil in cap space that they have. They need to short change someone.I would have no issues with offering 3-4 million per year for 5 years to kadri, but that only leave a mil per year for franson. Perhaps the leafs  think Bolland is a better player. What will happen is Bolland will slide into the 2 spot when he is percect as the 3. center. Kadri is a great second line center. Energy player, gritty, will attract power plays, can put the puck in the net, too weak on defense to be the number 1. Makes a great fit imo. Kadri and Bolland as 2 and 3. would be great, then the top spot needs to be evauluated. With the changes in net I really like that. I think the leafs will be an improved team over last year and last year they surpassed everyones expectations.  Do I think kadri is the next Gretzky? No. Do I thnk is a good player, on the upswing with loads of pure hockey tallent. Yes I do. I would hate to see him traded to another team."
806692,Jigger,2013-09-07 01:31:00,1237,"^^ the No.1 spot was evaluated and Bozak was thrown big dollars + term. The Kadri camp may not have much bargaining power as RFA, but they certainly can argue that if Bozak was thrown that contract, then Kadri deserves a significant upgrade."
806696,danc,2013-09-07 01:51:00,4677,There's no more money to spend. That there is the biggest issue.
806697,muskymatt,2013-09-07 01:56:00,2608, Hmmmm Ottawa has lots of money to pick up Kadri!  
806698,danc,2013-09-07 02:02:00,4677,Then you shoulda signed Alfie. The greatest hockey player in the history of the universe. I think Alfie left Ottawa just because of you.
806755,tb4me,2013-09-07 21:36:00,3295,lol that's funny...As far as the Sens and Kadri.. get out the offer sheet..I think the Leafs will send Liles to the Marlies to free up some space..That will free up some coin to get franson and kadri signed...
806779,moxie,2013-09-08 04:09:00,1566,The  nightmare begins anew.
806796,muskymatt,2013-09-08 14:13:00,2608," LOL Yup. all because of little ol me!!  Never said he was the greatest player in the history of the universe, that was Gretzky. Remember him? The guy who high sticked Tucker and then scored the GWG to send the laffs packing the golf bags ,,,,bwahahaahaha  Just another of many player to unset the laffy fans and give them reason to hate others. Not the fact the laffs suck but every body else is to blame. It must be a conspiracy."
806862,kickingfrog,2013-09-08 22:20:00,8333,"Gretzky clipped Glimour and crusty the clown cross-checked Tucker but other than that, your point was made."
807228,kickingfrog,2013-09-11 01:38:00,8333,Net talk is Kadri is going to sign for 2 years for aprox 6 million total.
807230,leaf4,2013-09-11 01:52:00,2466,"kadri signed 2 year 2.9million a year, I'm happy with this, all eyes on franson now hopefully they send liles to the ahl, they can free up 700,000 and put it towards signing franson to an identical term"
807233,BillM,2013-09-11 01:57:00,17367,Good to hear the kid is signed.
807251,lookinforwalleye,2013-09-11 03:01:00,4399,well I hope the poor kid can live on 5.8 million for the next two years!!!!
807252,Stoty,2013-09-11 03:02:00,2910,Not bad.... for a completely unproven player. lol....
807282,BillM,2013-09-11 11:23:00,17367," If last year was any glimpse of what he's got in store for the Leafs, I'm sure they'll be just fine.    I'm sure they also know a bit more then you do"
807285,Stoty,2013-09-11 11:28:00,2910,"Lmao... Last season isn't an accurate way to judge any team/player. He has a decent 1/2 season and he demands $7million. Then again for being one of the most arrogant guys in the league, not shocked."
807287,BillM,2013-09-11 11:39:00,17367, You're so far out in left field I can barely even see you.
807290,Richie Razor,2013-09-11 12:24:00,536,Arrogant guys in the league? Where did you come up with that?  This guy is a Habs or Sens fan.
807319,kickingfrog,2013-09-11 15:33:00,8333,"Ultimately we set the market, along with the owners, their cap and complete control of RFA's.  Some of us might not like it the amount of money, but this was a player with zero leverage so without question he would have got more per year and term on the open market."
806470,steelhead75,2013-09-05 10:33:00,35," have to agree,  and how about those jays  lmao"
806478,BillM,2013-09-05 11:33:00,17367,"Ottawa fan starting a Leafs thread, why am I not suprised, lol."
806483,big guy,2013-09-05 12:09:00,414,"Training camp starts on the 11th. So no, not almost 4 weeks, almost one week."
806486,Headhunter,2013-09-05 12:58:00,5703,"From what I can tell, Kadri should just shut up, sign a deal for two years and play. He will have the team by the short and curlys in two years, if he performs at the expected level. That's when the sun will shine for him and he will make alot of hay... I just don't get the short sightedness. HH"
806487,manitoubass2,2013-09-05 13:01:00,11391,"Was there an offer he turned down? Sorry, leafs fan here but haven't been able to watch any news for abit. Suppose I could google it, lol"
806494,BassMan11,2013-09-05 14:26:00,583,"Exactly,  1 half season of good hockey doesn't mean you deserve 5.5 mil and a long term deal the next year. 1 more solid (full season) and get the extension you deserve. Even though I like Nazem, he has a lot of growing up to do in the maturity and work ethic department. Never chirp Bob Mackenzie!!!!  Go Leafs Go"
806495,Richie Razor,2013-09-05 14:43:00,536,"  I don't get how he ""chirped"" Bob Mackenzie, all he said was ""False Bobo"" .... It's like he called Bob Mackenzie what his player name on the ice would be. Again the Toronto Media is blowing a story out of proportion and us (the fans) do not know the real story behind this. I just hope the kid understands the non sense that is the Toronto media, and pick up where he left off last season."
806499,jimmer,2013-09-05 15:03:00,2730,"X2 agree with HH.  However, he can chirp Bob Mackenzie all he wants. That guy...... never mind."
806502,BassMan11,2013-09-05 15:15:00,583,"Joking about the Bobo comment, just wondered why Kadri would say anything in response is all... just a little odd. Doesn't help with a rookie agent with 1 client making the deals either. Can't forget about signing Franson either, can't let him get away!"
806511,kickingfrog,2013-09-05 16:32:00,8333,"Interesting side note from the Brian Burke press conference, the Flames' arena is ready to go after the flooding."
806514,kickingfrog,2013-09-05 16:41:00,8333,"Sorry, arena WILL be ready. They expect to be able to have their pre-season games as scheduled."
806520,Sebastian,2013-09-05 17:03:00,208,"Kadri is a great player. In his short amount of games that he has played, he has proven to be an asset. He is just trying to get some money for his troubles. Not his fault that they used up so much cap space signing David Clarkson for 5+mil/year, the big contract for Bozak,etc. We shall see what happens....  He will play hard ball just like Subban, Drew Doughty,etc."
806524,kickingfrog,2013-09-05 17:30:00,8333,"Some of the media guys are very sensitive. They do not like the tables being even slightly turned. TV, radio and newsprint. They have had the almost exclusive ability to influence the fans but now some players can reach out to a section of fans and counter a talking head and some of them are very hissy about it."
806564,glen,2013-09-05 22:47:00,2641,I worry kadri will take a long contract and then float.
806568,tb4me,2013-09-05 23:47:00,3295,Go LEAFS GO....Praise Kadri..lol Burkie is gonna send an offer sheet his way..Anyone have a link for tonights game at all? Rookie or not this I gotta see....Sens Suck..
806570,lookinforwalleye,2013-09-06 00:18:00,4399,"Lets see if he can put a good full  season together before he is adorned with the ""great"" label!!!!"
806579,danc,2013-09-06 01:54:00,4677,"I really want to see Kadri on the team this year. But his contract expectations are way off. He came into the shortend season on fire, but he was already in shape from playing for the Marlies since the season started. No other Leaf had that advantage. He scored a couple of hat tricks. Great. But when the rest of the league caught up with him (in the playoffs) HE WAS A NO SHOW. The kid has 99 NHL games under his belt and he is demanding a Phil Kessel like contract. Not gonna happen in Toronto."
806582,manitoubass2,2013-09-06 03:15:00,11391,This is not gonna win over teammates and coaching staff
806595,Stoty,2013-09-06 09:25:00,2910,"Kadri is one of the most overrated and arrogant players in the league for having not proved anything in his career...  He's one of those players that shows up against the worst teams in the league, then disappears against any decent team. Where was he in the playoffs??? Did he even play?? lmao.  He needs to put his ego aside, until he actually proves something in the league. Last year was a complete joke and def not a way to accurately measure teams or players, only playing half the teams in the league and half the games. Hence why the Leafs actually made the playoffs.... We'll see how the Leafs and SIDNEY KADRI do in a full season against ALL the teams."
806605,Richie Razor,2013-09-06 12:23:00,536,"Ah hahahah!!!! LOL  Sens fans have no creditability anyways, so why even waste your time.  You shoulda just chimed in with how much more better the sens will be this year, like how Bobby Ryan will score 50 goals this year, and Erik karlesson will win another Norris ...... That way people will actually read what a sens fan thinks!!!! LOL"
806609,Stoty,2013-09-06 14:04:00,2910,If only I were a Sens fan....
806612,BillM,2013-09-06 14:17:00,17367,"Kadri hasn't even had a 'career' yet, what does the kid need to prove?  Does everyone really think it's him and not his agent that's being the hardass in all of this?  From what I can tell he kid wants to play hockey and that's about it.   Look at all the other pros that don't show up during the playoffs and people are surprised Kadri didn't?    Seriously, are you guys even hockey fans or just come into threads like this and spout your nonsense?"
806614,jedimaster,2013-09-06 14:21:00,3472,"I saw kadri play a few games in person and this kid, and make no mistake he is still a kid has serious hockey skills. He is clearly not a number 1 center as he is lacking the size and face off ability. He plays a gritty game, grittier than his size. He plays every shift with heart. He can put the puck in the net and make great passes. The problem with his role is that its not defined. He was stuffed on a line where he didn't fit. He was brought up and down and benched for ever little thing he did wrong. I am not saying he is the end all and be all. But is a very good player. IMO one of the most talented players on the leafs.  As someone mentioned ask the habs next year if the bridge contract was worth it. The big question is do you think Kadri will catch lightning in a bottle this year. If the answer is yes then a bridge contract will kill the leafs. If not than a bridge is the way to go. I am looking forward to seeing Kadri continue to grow. It has been a long time since the leafs had a player with this much skill at such a young age. They just need to keep shaping him and put him on the ice in the right circumstances."
806631,kickingfrog,2013-09-06 16:38:00,8333,"Well that was fast.  From FAN 590: Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment Ltd. has just announced the resignation of Tom Anselmi, the Chief Operating Officer of the company"
806633,Jigger,2013-09-06 16:46:00,1237,Wow that came out of left field!
806395,muskymatt,2013-09-04 22:24:00,2608,"With the start of a full season after the lockout just around the corner you have to wonder about Kadris attitude and conduct.  Being disrespectful to one of the pioneers of modern hockey reporting. WTH  Who does this guy think he is?  Has he been smoking up with Rob Ford?  Does he really think he is worth that much money?  Is this guy for real, holding out????    Stay tuned next week for another exciting episode of  ""As the laff turns""   "
806396,davey buoy,2013-09-04 22:26:00,5505,Hazel Mae has more!lol. He needs to pay his dues first IMO. Put your time in like everyone else.
806404,big guy,2013-09-04 22:54:00,414,More the agent treading the player astray than the player himself. Agents are scum.
806405,glen,2013-09-04 22:54:00,2641,Media may ruin his career.
806408,misfish,2013-09-04 23:03:00,29133,"Not sure he,s worth more,but being put on the back burner,when he should of been in the line up long ago to show he could play,I can see having a good shorten season,make him think he,s worth it. Myself,he,s not.Good young player ? Yes. Like said,he needs to put a whole season together. Welcome back  lowly sens praise ALFIE fan..Dont feel bad. We went through the same thing with  trader Sundin.LMAO"
806409,lookinforwalleye,2013-09-04 23:04:00,4399,What you talking about willis...he has played 99 games what more does he have to prove!  He not doing anything different than any other young greedy hockey player these days.
806413,muskymatt,2013-09-04 23:20:00,2608," Thank you, nice to see I'm appreciated   , and YES you did"
806415,muskymatt,2013-09-04 23:23:00,2608,  Up and down in the minors over 4 seasons is not exactly an established player 
806416,danc,2013-09-04 23:30:00,4677, Pretty sure that you missed the sarcasm.
806417,Roy,2013-09-04 23:30:00,13728,Ahhhhh fer Gawd's sake. Give it a freakin' break!
806418,kickingfrog,2013-09-04 23:31:00,8333," ""Nazem Kadri is an idiot"" … and you can take that to the bank 'cause the expert has spoken."
806419,glen,2013-09-04 23:38:00,2641,It can't be that hard to figure out the going rate for a player.  It is stupid for him to miss training camp. I would like him on the team right now. They better get it together so they can win the cup.
806420,muskymatt,2013-09-04 23:41:00,2608,Apparently so lol
806421,muskymatt,2013-09-04 23:46:00,2608," Ah c'mon Roy, it's Canada's game, it's in our culture to talk about it and criticize other teams players!  "
806424,danc,2013-09-05 00:03:00,4677,"Well it is undeniable that the Leafs will be talked about here, so I've edited the title to make it a Leafs thread. Anyone not interested simply does not have to click. Any Leafs topics posted eslewhere will either be moved or deleted at the moderators discretion. Fair enough?"
806428,muskymatt,2013-09-05 00:08:00,2608,"  Actually, it's supposed to be a Laffs suck thread, but it's close enough!"
806433,kickingfrog,2013-09-05 00:31:00,8333,"I'm not about to defend Nazem (and certainly not his agent), but I'm not going to bury him either. He is not under contract. Training camp doesn't start for almost 4 weeks. As much as young players need camp if he doesn't have a contract he can't take the chance of skating with the team (if the team even lets him).The Leafs know this, Nazem knows this.  This is a negotiation, please don't act like it's the first one you've witnessed.  The league got their 3 year entry level contracts they wanted because they kept blowing their brains out on duds (Alexandre Daigle would be exhibit A). The result is now they can't make up their minds on what the market on these RFAs is before they become UFAs."
806436,danc,2013-09-05 00:36:00,4677,"  Actually, their first game of the regular season is less than 4 weeks away."
806437,kickingfrog,2013-09-05 00:39:00,8333,"Some might suggest that ""almost 4 weeks"" is very similar to ""less then 4 weeks""… And rookie camp games don't count."
806439,danc,2013-09-05 00:46:00,4677,"Some might suggest that there's a big difference between training camp and the actual season, when they start playing for keeps, which starts Oct. 1."
806452,Richie Razor,2013-09-05 03:05:00,536,"You guys are incredible!!!  Tell me when was the last time the leafs drafted such a talented offensive player? And when was the last leaf to score 2 hat tricks in half a season?  This guy is the real deal, he should of been playing with the leafs the year he was drafted, his agent just wants fair market value for his client, look at other young players in the NHL that put up similar numbers in half a season, and see what they're getting paid.  He's has what cherry calls ""magic hands"", is quick on his skates, and has a mean side to him. This kid has heart and has done everything the leafs have asked of him since day 1.  I hope for 1 of 3 things; 1. He holds out and the leafs tank the first part of the season.... You can bet he'll get what he wants then 2. A team signs him to an offer sheet, and give up a 1st and 3rd rd pick in next years draft.... Totally worth it for this caliber of player 3. Leafs trade him and see him flourish with another team, which we leaf fans have seen before.... Many times over.  The leafs seriously screwed with this guy since drafting him, and I hope he screws them back."
806455,darsky,2013-09-05 03:22:00,586,"Subban held out at the beginning of last shortened season and all of its training camp. He settled,got a good 2 yr contract and started HUGE."
806456,lookinforwalleye,2013-09-05 03:28:00,4399,Well if Don says it it must be true!
806459,Richie Razor,2013-09-05 03:39:00,536," In hindsight mtl will wish they paid him long term at what he was originally asking, 5+ mil/ yr 5 yrs... They won't be able to keep him, cause he'll want 7-8 mil per yr after a Norris season....."
806460,Richie Razor,2013-09-05 03:41:00,536,"Darn straight!!!!  Lol  No Habs fans allowed on leafs threads, thks"
