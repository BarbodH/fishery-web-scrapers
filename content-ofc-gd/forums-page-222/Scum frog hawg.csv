866052,sleded,2014-08-02 12:14:00,96,Went out with a buddy from noon to 4. We started out fishing frogs in the pond scum ended up getting 3 with a nice 20 inch largie 
866053,AdamS,2014-08-02 12:24:00,161,nice fish!
866056,lookinforwalleye,2014-08-02 13:14:00,4399,Nice fish...I love fishing frogs but I find the modern frogs have a very low hook up ratio...maybe it`s my lousy technique!
866073,Tim Mills,2014-08-02 16:39:00,476,Nicely done
866081,pidge,2014-08-02 18:55:00,438,"That's a pig! Nice one. To the Habs fan..I use some scent stuff like the chap stick kind...when the fish strikes I give it a full 2 seconds, maybe 3 and then set the hook. I struggled for years as well with the hook set on frogs, but if you pause and let him have it you should be good to go. I know it's hard to resist the hook set when the water breaks, but let them take it. Try it next time your out. Good luck.  Pidge."
