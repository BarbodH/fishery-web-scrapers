865865,jsmith1049,2014-07-31 23:33:00,3,"My name is James Smith.  I am a store manager for The Orvis Co. in Asheville, NC.  My grandparents have a cottage on 12 Mile Lake near Minden, ON.  I will be arriving late on August 5th and leaving early August 9th.  I have done some small mouth fishing  on the lake in the past but was looking to see what else was available in the area.  I am open to do pretty much anything that can be done wade fishing or out of a sit on top kayak.  I will have a 4, 5, 6, and 8wt with me so will be able to target just about anything, I just need some advice on where to go.  Any help with this would be greatly appreciated.  I have not been able to get up to the cottage in almost 4 years so I would love to make good use of my time.  Thanks in advance for any help!"
865892,Musky or Specks,2014-08-01 01:19:00,2710,James here is a tool that might be useful for you.  http://www.web2.mnr.gov.on.ca/fish_online/fishing/fishingExplorer_en.html  Enter the species you wish to fish for and then Minden and how far your willing to go. Personally there are a lot of speckled trout lakes in the area a 8wt with a fast sinking tip or full sink line with large trout streamers down at @ 20-30 ft and you might hook up. Otherwise I'd probably go to Head Lake in Haliburton and fish for Muskie.
865915,Pigeontroller,2014-08-01 03:22:00,2793,"Downstream end of Horseshoe Lake there is a nice stretch of whitewater that holds smallmouth Bass. There's generally alot of (weekend)kayaking going on which makes fishing tough, weekdays you may have it to yourself..."
865916,solopaddler,2014-08-01 03:27:00,8605,The Gull River in Minden has rainbow trout. Start at the dam and work down from there.
865926,fishindevil,2014-08-01 06:50:00,6254,As mike says there is trout in the river and I believe further down there is a really good stretch for fly fishing I have seen guys fly fishing there before and I think there's brown trout as well in a section mike if I'm not mistaken ?? South of Scott's dam ?? But anywhere along that stretch of river you should have fun with a fly rod  and lots of areas to hit too !!!! Good luck
865931,singingdog,2014-08-01 10:03:00,1047,"The whitewater section of the Gull used to be great for rainbows, not so much anymore. I don't know if they changed the stocking program upstream, but the number of bows in that section of river has decreased dramatically in the past couple of years."
865960,jsmith1049,2014-08-01 14:32:00,3,Thanks for everyones help.  I will have a few days to try out a few different places so I may just go for a little bit of everything.
865978,jsmith1049,2014-08-01 17:47:00,3,As far as the trout fishing goes.  What is the average size of the fish in the Gull?
866055,solopaddler,2014-08-02 12:59:00,8605,"As far as the trout fishing goes.  What is the average size of the fish in the Gull?  They're stocked so most are small, 12-15"". If you're lucky you'll catch a holdover. I've seen some 2-4lb fish from the Gull. Mind you my info might be dated, it's been a while since I've fished it.  There's a district MNR office right in Minden, (705) 286-1521  If I were you I'd call them and ask to speak with a biologist. They're generally very helpful and will answer all your questions and point you in the right direction."
866059,singingdog,2014-08-02 13:51:00,1047,"I used to catch lots of 15-16"" bows in the Gull, with the occasional 18-20"" fish. I haven't seen a bow like that from the river for a couple of years. It is really tough to flyfish the whitewater section right now with the overhead cables up for the slalom course."
