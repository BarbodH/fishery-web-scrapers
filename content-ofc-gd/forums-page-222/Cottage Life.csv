Went up north for 2 days, (saturday and sunday), first time on the lake saturday, we hit some rocky points with minimal luck, had a nice walleye come off and the biggest crappie i have even seen, thing must of been over 18 inches, hit a husky jerk! Was too late with the net and its mouth ripped open. We then decided to go enjoy the evening and boat around the lake but not without a little fishing in between! The speed was slow in the channels in populated areas so i though, why not troll a husky jerk? After 15 minutes of trolling, i decided to pack it in, reeled in with a few jerks in between, feel something heavy at the end of the line, its jerking a bit, then i pause and the weight at the end of my line isn't moving at all, i continue reeling in, see a nice pine at the end of the line, he saw me too and decided to swim down under the boat, man was i lucky to have strong line and a good reel, got him in the net and fished a few weeds and got 9 more little pike mostly on spinners. The next morning only got 2 pike, one hammer handle, the other decent sized. The evening is when the fun started, 18 pike in less than 2 hours, literally every few casts was a fish! All small little pike on spinners however i did lose a hog at the boat due to a poor net job. Got 1 walter trolling a small crank and a smallie on a spinner. Everyone at the cottage was happy as everyone else much to my surprise got skunked! Had a huge fish fry and brought some home for the bbq and to smoke, def. coming back up next weekend![/url[/url[/url[/url[/url"
