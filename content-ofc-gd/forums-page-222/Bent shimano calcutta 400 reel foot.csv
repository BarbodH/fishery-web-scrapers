I have bent it back, but the next fish I hooked, it happened again.  It is pretty awkward to say the least.   Can you not upload pics from photobucket on here anymore?  "
866277,kickingfrog,2014-08-04 14:52:00,8333,I would have thought that the reel seat would give before the foot?
866279,F_ast,2014-08-04 14:55:00,154,Me too.  Trying to upload pics from photobucket..... they wont copy though

I'd just ship it over to Shimano in Peterboro and let them fix it. Great service and may not take to long to get it back to you."
866281,F_ast,2014-08-04 15:02:00,154,Ya Lew... I have been there a few times this year.  I have been trying to call them but I cant find their number.  When I called shimano in Peterborough they transferred me to some place in Washington.

866287,esoxansteel,2014-08-04 15:28:00,1307,"If its a TE, im looking at mine, and it is separate from the housing, so it should be able to be replaced, providing that part is still available, with the TE been discontinued, the foot is silver, and looks to be press fitted to the brass housing in 2 places"
866305,F_ast,2014-08-04 18:00:00,154,It is just a 400.  I have 2 other TEs and they are all the same piece.  Just hope they can press them in.  They are a pressed in rivet for sure.  Anyone have the number for Chris in the Rod repair shop in Peterborough?
866330,Tom McCutcheon,2014-08-04 19:45:00,627,You have a PM
866360,esoxansteel,2014-08-04 23:03:00,1307,"Might be touch and go, if they can fix that one in Peterborough, let them know that you bent it back, and the same thing happened, as im sure that will cross there minds as the easiest and simplest approach at fixing the reel foot. Dont recall seeing a press when ive visited, although i had an old 6500 ambassadeur do the same thing, and had the foot welded back on, and never had an issue again, just a little sloppy with the weld and burn marks from heating"
866674,F_ast,2014-08-06 23:33:00,154,"Turns out there is not part number for the foot alone... It is considered non fixable and needs to be replaced.  However since the 400 series is discontinued, there are not available chassis.  So, I think I may try to JB weld the bottom inside arch to see if that will stiffen it."
