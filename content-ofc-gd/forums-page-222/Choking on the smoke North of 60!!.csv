Air quality has been brutal and our only route to the South has been closed more than it has been open. It's closed again today for some unknown reason.   Been choking up at the cabin lease pretty bad as well. You would figure all the smoke would get rid of the bugs, but the black flies are pretty bad today.    Did get my dock completed except for my mooring whips (ordered this week and picking up at the new Cabelas in Anchorage next month.  The last 4 anchor boulders have been installed as well as the shore side chain retainers and chains. Also finished installing the dock edging. Need to finish my trail and hopefully lay out my foundation before the end of the weekend."
