866177,Dave Bailey,2014-08-03 17:47:00,1641,Here's a link to a brief run-down on what you need to know: NOTE: boiling the water actually increases the level of the toxin  http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2014/08/03/3467068/toledo-ohio-water-crisis/
866190,bigcreekdad,2014-08-03 18:51:00,546,I live in Toledo. Can't drink water. You'd think we had been hit by an atom bomb.
866191,misfish,2014-08-03 18:53:00,29133,"I heard today,they pulled all the water bottles of the shelves down state side."
866212,OhioFisherman,2014-08-03 20:52:00,6623,"http://www.sustainabletable.org/267/water-quality   http://gracelinks.org/789/drinking-water-week-blues-nitrate-pollution-from-coast-to-coast  I recall reading an article that Ohio used to pay farmers to leave a buffer zone of undisturbed area around fields that bordered rivers and streams.  In that article it said some farmers with the increases prices for soybeans and corn as alternate fuel sources had done away with those areas, it was more profitable to plant than protect."
866224,Dave Bailey,2014-08-03 22:45:00,1641,"If they keep pulling back the protection, how soon will it be before the Cuyahoga catches fire again?"
866226,OhioFisherman,2014-08-03 23:04:00,6623,"Actually Dave a lot of the former industry in that area has been relocated to China or Mexico, until our labor costs reach the level of theirs I don't see it becoming a problem.  The Cuyahoga does provide drainage though for a lot of farm land miles to the south of Cleveland and Akron, if they aren't careful both might face the same issues?   http://www.epa.state.oh.us/dsw/tmdl/CuyahogaRiver.aspx"

866248,OhioFisherman,2014-08-04 05:51:00,6623,"bushart, I totally agree on the labor and wages. I don't have a clear idea on the Toronto area and housing prices, but 350-400k can get you a pretty nice shack in a good area here.  http://www.homes.com/property/4016-fairway-dr-medina-oh-44256/id-600026365031/"
866249,Woodsman,2014-08-04 06:44:00,1286, http://www.homes.com/property/4016-fairway-dr-medina-oh-44256/id-600026365031/ In the small town I live in it will get you a great place but in Toronto 350-400k will not get a nice shack or good area. Here's an example of what's for sale in Toronto.  http://beta.realtor.ca/PropertyDetails.aspx?PropertyId=14521020&CultureId=1  *Note the land size.*
866275,AdamS,2014-08-04 14:00:00,161,"Wow I hadn't heard about this yet. Real shame though. I hope they get it sorted out soon so you can start drinking water again bigcreek.  It's amazing the difference in house prices. That is a small lot woodsman. If that house in Ohio was in Toronto, it would be worth millions."

LOL It sounds like NYC or LA. My first home had a 50x126 lot and I thought that was small.  I guess like parts of this country area seems to dictate pricing?  Now this place in Kentucky seems like a nice lot to me!  http://www.landandfarm.com/property/CROFTON_RESERVOIR_50_ACRES_PRIVATE_17_ACRE_LAKE-1445438/
