866356,esoxansteel,2014-08-04 22:51:00,1307,"Bridgenorth Sports right at the causeway in Bridgenorth, its on your way to Buckhorn, after you get your minnows, head out of Bridgenorth going north, and take the Selwyn Road, right to the Buckhorn road, and turn left, it will take you right to Buckhorn"
866363,dropaline,2014-08-04 23:19:00,20,Bridgenorth Sports is the best place specially if your heading up to Buckhorn. Well it is the best place in my books for that neck of the woods. Happy Fishing
866364,i2cool2fool,2014-08-04 23:23:00,349,I seen a sign for a bait shop/taxidermy business directly beside Mainstreet Landing Pub. And speaking of the pub....one heck of a great spot to tickle the taste buds or wet the whistle.
866366,Locnar,2014-08-04 23:41:00,645,Thanks guys! I'll check out that place in Bridgenorth.
