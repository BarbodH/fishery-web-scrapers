But I didn't get out all of July, and even the possibility of traffic from you know where wasn't gonna stop me wetting the lines today.  Hit the water at 6:15 and G was feeling the pain. He climbed under the cover and went to sleep. While he was sleeping I had two break offs - not like me at all. Must be rusty. Then it slowed down. Marks were few and far between, and those that were looked mostly to be lakers. So after a few hours we relented and put the SWR down to the bottom.    They weren't what were were looking for, but they sure beat a skunk. Trying out the new Go Pro. Got a ways to go before I have something usable like Simon or Terry. Chad - this laker's for you"

866159,cheaptackle,2014-08-03 16:10:00,849,whutinthebloodyblueblazesofhades is ZEC?  Saw it on a Kay-beck map - think it's something like a provincial park but have no idea what it really means.  Michael
866178,Rod Caster,2014-08-03 17:48:00,5784,Its a managed hunting / fishing zone . Usually the fishing is great in the Zec areas.
