866228,spincast,2014-08-03 23:11:00,3279,"G's best friend has only been fishing in a boat once, and rarely fished at all.  We had talked for a while about another outing together (took him on lake O once and he caught a nice little Coho). Today we decided to introduce him to Lake E. Second rod wasn't even set up before he had his first gold  shortly after that we ran into a bit of a rough spell as I tried to set up six lines and  the boys were more interested in chatting and checking out wally-in-the-well. Cost us a cluster and a rod by the time we were done  . Worse things can happen. We moved on and tried some water that didn't want to play. I really should listen to that inner voice more. It kept saying 65 FOW but I figured the pack of boats in 58 was on to something - and some were. But our Karma needed 65. After a few hours of watching others bag them here and there I said 'nuf. Packed her up and headed out to 65. 15 minutes and we're into a goodie.   About 20 minutes later a first for me - the wire dipsey set up screams out and  a few minutes later, Helloooooo big boy   all three were nice and clean, healthy fish. The we heard a crack of thunder, and being about 1/2 hour out of port decided better safe than sorry and headed in. G's friend had (can you believe it?) never eaten fresh fish before?   So he was invited to supper and found out the pleasures of fishing go beyond a few hours in the boat. I hope we gave him some memories to start his own angling explorations when he is old enough         Well , that's E & O for the long weekend, E, eye, E eye O."
