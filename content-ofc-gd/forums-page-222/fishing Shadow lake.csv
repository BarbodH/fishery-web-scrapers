864184,fishindevil,2014-07-22 09:47:00,6254,There is lots of pike in shadow lake as well !!! It can fish well but it's a smaller lake and gets busy on weekends I have done well there in the past as well !!! Walleye fishing can be ok at times too !!
864363,chris.brock,2014-07-23 03:22:00,4053,"the road is obvious, the sign on hwy 35 says something like ""Gov't Dock Rd"" or ""Public launch Rd"""
