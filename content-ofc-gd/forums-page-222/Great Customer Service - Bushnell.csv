I bought a pair of Bushnell binoculars probably around 5 years ago, certainly well past the typical 1 year warranty.The connector where the strap connects to the binoculars had broken and I went to take them in for repair. The lady said that they no longer make the connector so she gave me a brand new pair of the current version of my binoculars. No questions asked and it took less than 10 minutes.  Will I buy another Bushnell product in the future - absolutely!!   Jon"

865844,woodenboater,2014-07-31 22:15:00,2277,"great outcome and this is a company that understands marketing. For the cost of a pair of binos, they now have a customer for life who will now recommend bushnells to everyone who asks. Why more companies don't make this SOP is beyond me.  and I also have a pair of Bushnells that are going on who knows how many years !"
