Every time I went further into Ontario than Niagara Falls I crossed that bridge, and I can only imagine the headaches and problem with it will involve.  Part of the breakup of the unions and union drivers? In no way am I claiming they were all perfect. You own a trucking company, leased drivers or independent drivers are the way to go? Oh, they don't work for us, you can't hold us responsible for their mistakes?  Even if you require them to have a million dollar liability coverage policy? Will it even begin to cover that actual costs. Then there is the old saying about squeezing blood out of a rock? How many ordinary people could even begin to pay the costs of repairs in a lifetime of work."

865948,Rich Clemens,2014-08-01 13:44:00,3131, I remember that year Rich what a PITA that drive was. Are you heading north tomorrow the 2nd or the next week the 9th? We're at Memquisit starting the 9th so I'm hoping things will be relatively normal by then but we come thru very early to get north of 400 before the traffic gets too bad. We'll be at the border by 5:00AM  Leaving early tomorrow morning.  I won't be hitting the border until somewhere around 9:30am / 10:00am.

865993,Steve,2014-08-01 19:03:00,2075,"your right Lew.  it even goes further.  if your a boater in the harbour, due to the traffic issues, they are only raising the lift bridge once an hour....and this, I understand, is 24 hours a day.  So if you use the lift bridge launch, and want to fish lake ontario, and cannot get underneath the bridge, you'll have to wait to the ""once an hour"" lift....  in the past it would be lifted as needed...which could be as much as five-six times an hour.  as a result, many boats are going to be waiting a long time to get out of the harbour....  if you are a boater that can't fit underneath, maybe it would be best to find a new launch for this weekend."
865999,lew,2014-08-01 19:29:00,12766,"    as a result, many boats are going to be waiting a long time to get out of the harbour..  Just a guess here Steve, but I imagine any big freighters will get priority over pleasure craft passing through there."
866000,Steve,2014-08-01 19:31:00,2075,they actually were filming a big freighter moving through the canal when the OPP was being interviewed.  the copper mentioned the port authority is aware of the time per hour of the lift and will be advising the freighters accordingly.  it would be nice if they post the time per hour of the lift so the rec boaters aren't guessing when it'll be.

Rich 403 may be OK on Saturday morning, take 20 to where it enters hamilton, Centennial Parkway, there is a GM dealer on the south west corner, a shopping plaza on the north west corner and keep going straight till you intersect with Upper Gage, go south NORTH !on Upper Gage to the Lincoln Alexander expressway, go west and it will intersect with the 403.
