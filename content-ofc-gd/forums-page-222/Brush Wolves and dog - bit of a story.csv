865826,lew,2014-07-31 21:08:00,12766,"We've got a few coyotes around here but not many, but I had an animal on my front lawn a couple years back that I'm not sure what it was, possibly a coydog ??  He was about the size of a heavy German Sheppard with shortish brown grey hair and just as mean looking as they come.  I opened the front door to chase him away and he just sorta sneered at me and wandered off down the road."
865833,bushart,2014-07-31 21:40:00,2628,"I spent a lot of time over the years hunting on my own (or with all my friends as I like to say   )  I recall one Fall morn--right at 1st light----fog so thick could'nt see anywhere---so I park my butt under an old pine tree and try and wait it out  so of course I give my deer call a couple grunts---couple mins later I get a timber howlin to my left---and again even with my 06---the hair on the back of my neck stands up  Then one answers straight ahead---then a 3rd answers to the right---now it gives a real uneasy feelin bein in the great out nowhere----when this is goin on with fog so thick ya can hardly see the end of the gun barrel  I've had it 3x in my life when they've called to ""Surround"" me---every time either calf moose callin or deer callin"
865836,Big Cliff,2014-07-31 21:48:00,6899,"Best way I know to handle it is to go hunting them, they seem to know when they are being hunted and are almost impossible to see!"
865838,bushart,2014-07-31 22:00:00,2628,Ya know I've had opportunity to drill the big dog---but me and him have had an agreement for some time  he leaves me alone and I'll do likewise  I know lots of hunters say they hurt their hunting---but I usually get what I'm after  I always look at it---he was huntin on this land long before I came along
865841,bare foot wader,2014-07-31 22:10:00,1354,"glad to hear your dog did good and nothing major happened...did the wolf/hybrid look starving or injured?  coyotes and wolves are smart critters, kill a few of them and they learn quick....do some rabbit calling and see what happens  had a couple of close calls with my pup, he's somewhat educated now but also still rocking his nuts and won't use his brain if he catches scent, so I'm pretty careful ice fishing with him...wolves and coyotes everywhere out west  regularly see the female on the tree line, yipping and whining, playful with others waiting in the bush...my 8 month old lab fell for it but I was watching at the time....he had a quick tussle with the yotes and got the crap scared out of him, I dropped 1 and they took off...they're still around but want nothing to do with us now, whenever they cross the fence line I give them a reminding now and then, it works....but if you have a food source out there, it'll constantly attract them"
865861,Rod Caster,2014-07-31 23:27:00,5784,"I never noticed any particulars on it because it was running ahead and away from me then ran into the bush. Someone in the neighborhood said they saw a gangly looking wolf (or brushy) around, so it may be a hungry /desperate loner. Who knows..., but I may find out soon. I need a bigger gun is one thing I know for sure."
865882,Nipfisher,2014-08-01 00:32:00,2449,"Hope your dog, rabbits and family stay safe. Hope it doesn't scare off the deer. We need a good buck this year. 308 and crossbow are ready!"
865705,Rod Caster,2014-07-31 02:21:00,5784,"I drove out of my ATV trails and headed home on the road when I saw a big brown 'thing' just behind my dog, who was well ahead of me. I pinned the throttle and as I got within 40 meters I realized it was a big canine trotting up to my dog, who was unaware. As I approached, the ATV spooked it and it turn onto my lawn. At that point, Buddy (the dog) realized it was 10 meters behind him and he flipped out and nearly caught up with it until they ran into the bush together. I could tell by the barking that they were kind of chasing each other back and forth in the bush. I eventually got Buddy to come but I could hear it in the bush still pacing and panting.  After 20 minutes of silence, Buddy bolts for my lawn and I hear them scraping and growling. By the time I got my ATV and gun; It was getting dark so I had already put the gun away before that; the fight had stopped and I only saw the animal's eyes in the bush but never saw it again.  I heard Buddy snap on something a week ago and I figured it was a coyote. Based on the conversations I've had with neighbors, it was likely a brush wolf. I don't know what it wanted with my dog, or maybe it wanted my rabbits, but that thing was on a mission. I estimate it to be 100-120lbs and my dog is closer to 40. Lots of GOOD BOYS! for Buddy for doing his job. That dog don't take poop from any animal bigger than him. Siberian Husky's make good property dogs!  Anybody else have experience with these coyote/wolf mixes?"
865708,Freshtrax,2014-07-31 02:27:00,2215,Sometimes they will try to get domestics to join the pack.
865709,bushart,2014-07-31 02:28:00,2628,Did it have yellow eyes when you saw them in the bush??  I've heard Many times where they'll lead dogs away towards a pack---does'nt end well for the dog  120 lbs sounds too big for a coyote
865711,Rod Caster,2014-07-31 02:43:00,5784,"I only saw the reflection of it's eyes. I was nearly dark.  I don't think he'd like a wild pack, no atv and sled runs haha  Oh, is it Brush wolf or Bush Wolf???"
865717,DRIFTER_016,2014-07-31 03:38:00,10439," Oh, is it Brush wolf or Bush Wolf???  Probably a Grey Timber Wolf and a big one @ that. Have seen some big ones but no where near as big as some of the white wolves I have seen on the tundra. Saw one back in the winter of 2007 that was huge like a Great Dane. When I pulled onto the lake with my sled it decided it wanted to come and say hi!!!!  I pinned the throttle on my 1000cc toy and said SEE YA!!!!"
865720,cram,2014-07-31 03:49:00,1733,Brush wolves are half that size.  Maybe a timber wolf.
865722,Rod Caster,2014-07-31 04:03:00,5784,There are definitely timber wolves in the area...seen the pack tracks in winter and heard the stories. The brown color is what threw me off. I could be overestimating its weight but it was definitely nearly twice as tall as Buddy.
865723,glen,2014-07-31 06:10:00,2641, Has your dog had its rabbies shot?
865730,bushart,2014-07-31 11:41:00,2628,"I've been up close and personal in my life with timbers.....some have brown in their fur  Quick true story....one day my son and I were headed off on a trail by a min of 8 wolves in NW Ontario---and yes we were close enough to see the teeth snarl  any way we just kept shootin above their heads (12 ga birdshot was all we had)---they eventually let us by---but they tracked us out to the truck   anyway a couple days later---I'm alone---and even with a 30 cal...you get an uneasy feeling---now I need to head down that same trail---so here's Hero boy...alone in the forest---long ways from anyone....so what do I do??  Yep stand at the hill before headin down the trail and yell.....""That's right boys...it's me...Dr. Venkman""  Yet another loonie moment in a long list from painter boy---good thing no one was around--they'd lock me up   I told the story to my buddy who talked to an old trapper---he figured the pack had something down--that's why they did'nt want to leave  Actually I've got quite a few wolf encounters ---couple bear one as well"
865734,Rod Caster,2014-07-31 11:58:00,5784,"Yes, and he's getting another one within the month when the clinic rolls into town.  BA, a very similar story was told by the previous owner of my house. My wife all of sudden has been talking about guns haha"
865740,outllaw,2014-07-31 12:58:00,1232,"here yotes max at 40lbs. maybe you met a coydog. or a wolf. either way your gonna lose your dog to mauling without controlling it. not trying to sound brutal,but normally theres more then one wolve/coydog"
865744,LucG,2014-07-31 13:11:00,779,"There are both timber wolves & ""brush wolves"" in our area. The majority being the smaller brush wolf type, usually averaging 50-60 lbs topping out at about an 80-85 lbs animal. An actual timber wolf can easily reach 100-110 lbs.  I doubt another dog would act the way you described this animal. Sounds like a hungry wolf to me, especially knowing you have rabbits in your yard. lol"
865746,Rod Caster,2014-07-31 13:25:00,5784,"Thanks for the input. I'm thinking it was a bit Brushy.... I likely overestimated the weight though...he may have had long fur or something.  My dog is suprisingly mean/relentless when it comes to other aggressive dogs. I've seen him beat up, and badly, a dominant 120lbs Bull Mastif...he doesn't take crap from any dog. Still, that wolf will likely meet it's fate by gun if it keeps coming by. I'm not a fan of killing anything other than for food, but this thing may present a danger to my dog, rabbits, wife and later, the kid."
865750,bushart,2014-07-31 13:44:00,2628,Again I've heard Many times where wolves lure dogs away---dogs not heard from again
865759,DRIFTER_016,2014-07-31 14:39:00,10439,Again I've heard Many times where wolves lure dogs away---dogs not heard from again  Exactly!!! That's why I always keep an eye on mine when we're out at the lease. Lots of wolves and bears in this area. Not too mention cougars and wolverines!!!!
865765,bushart,2014-07-31 15:01:00,2628,i know at times---wolves will even kill their own  dogs don't stand much chance
865785,jbailey,2014-07-31 17:47:00,866,"yea, i've also heard many stories about dogs being ""lured"" away only to become severely out numbered"
865794,Joeytier,2014-07-31 19:10:00,3990,"Buddy should consider himself lucky...a wolf that size could have tore him to pieces with little to no effort, seems like the wolf wasn't actively trying to kill him or even hurt him...pretty brazen of a single wild dog anyway!"
865797,davey buoy,2014-07-31 19:51:00,5505,"Better call him lucky!!!,that usually won'y end weel,as in some of the most researched study the wolf/dog is the toughest,followed by Caucasion shepard,and Cane Corso.These are big powerfull dogs that they say have no fear.Now if your talking full blown wolf,I'd make sure you watch your dog as well as you think he can do alright for himself.Kinda think you got away on that last confrontation.What a position to be in.I think your on the right track if he comes close any more .Good luck!!,he is now watching you."
865800,Rod Caster,2014-07-31 19:53:00,5784,Ya he was lucky. I think he surprised the wolf with his aggression too. I bet the wolf expected a more timid counterpart... now lets see if my rabbits are still alive when I get home from my work trip.
865803,Rod Caster,2014-07-31 19:57:00,5784,".Good luck!!,he is now watching you.  Haha, I wont be telling my wife that. Sharp eyes for the next little while.  My dog has previous experience with wolves (attacking them too) as he was a sled dog in another rural setting . The previous owner said he was fearless and I agree... that might be the death of him though"
865808,davey buoy,2014-07-31 20:03:00,5505,"Chad,just saying,he knows where you live,I don't think he will leave till he gets what he wants IMO.Hopefully I'm wrong ."
865819,Rod Caster,2014-07-31 20:48:00,5784,I hear ya. Its freaky having it hanging around.
865820,Big Cliff,2014-07-31 20:51:00,6899,"A few years ago I was across the road on my ATV and I saw a young black lab running across the field toward me, her tail was down and she looked scared.  It took a couple of seconds but not far behind her was a ""coydog"" for lack of a better description, bigger than a coyote and had quite a bit of brown in it's fur. I could tell she was in trouble but I didn't have a gun with me so I hit the throttle and charged toward them. I managed to get between them and then started trying to run over the coydog. The lab just sat and waited but the coydog didn't want to give up, it really wanted the little lab, I spent a good 15 or 20 minutes trying to hit the coydog and it finally started to back off but I had to chase it quite a way before it finally did take off.  The lab followed me home like she had been my dog for life, she was beautiful and well behaved, I put a blanket down in the garage and she just curled up on it and went to sleep.  I knew she had to belong to someone in the area but she didn't have a collar or tags so I called animal control and they came out and got her, with instructions that if they couldn't find her owner I would take her.  About three days later I got a call from a fellow that lives a couple of miles from here to let me know that he got his dog back, seems she had slipped her collar and run off. He was glad to get the dog back but he wasn't too happy about the fine they gave him for his dog running loose.  I know there are packs of coyotes in the area, one of our neigbours shot 20+ two years ago and we always see tracks when we go across the road into the bush in the winter.  Glad to hear that your dog is ok but as tough as he might be, he might not survive against a pack."
865821,davey buoy,2014-07-31 20:53:00,5505,"I hear ya. Its freaky having it hanging around. I guess,I'd Probably not be as calm as you.Hope you get that sorted out soon."
