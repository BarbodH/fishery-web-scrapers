865696,Handlebarz,2014-07-31 01:36:00,3790,Well I might be in the Toronto area Sunday so I thought I would take   a drive up and see the new store. Is anyone else planning on heading to there on Sunday?  What exit is it?  I plan on hitting there early maybe when it opens so I don't spend the day there.
