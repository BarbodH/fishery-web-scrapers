745122,BucktownAngler,2012-11-19 15:56:00,582,beatuy fish. so jealous!   whats up with the video quality? usually go pro vids are flawless HD
745134,ccmtcanada,2012-11-19 17:44:00,7971,Awesome fish and video!!!     My guess is when it was compressed to upload to youtube it lost it's HD properties.  Can happen if you choose a file format that compresses it too much.
