My darling, the light of my life, lost her battle to Pneumonia and Hodgkins lymphoma on August 2nd. Last time I was fishing was with her mid June and I haven't felt much like fishing or anything else since she was hospitalised. Exactly 3 months to the day after she died, I won a million dollars on the lotto max. Damn, I wish she was still here to enjoy it with me."

I see far too many people stuck in a train wreck of a marriage. So sad to see people wasting there lives like that. Get through your  grief in your own time, hold your head high and count yourself lucky because of what you two shared.  As far as the money goes, congrats on that.  The  book of your life has began a new chapter and you are the writer.  Pick the happiest ending you can."
