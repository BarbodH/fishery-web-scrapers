It's not keeping up to my brother running minnows but its doing respectable.... Better then nothing if minnows aren't available....  ""The walleye buster"" -berkley ripple shad 5"" -northland gumball jig 3/8 -vmc stinger hook 3""  "
745388,rob v,2012-11-20 19:11:00,535,Now that's a darn nice lookin rig - I'm going to have to get me some of them !!  thanks for sharing
745426,manitoubass2,2012-11-20 23:37:00,11391,"I've been using that for the past two years, and it can be deadly at times. I love the large ones spring/late fall, but the smaller ones in that pattern and the minnow pattern work well in the summer too.  I usually don't use stinger hooks on the larger ones though. The fish your after at those times of year will take that bait full in if the bite is on.  These are great pike and smallie baits too.  Are you trolling them, jigging them or just dragging them???"
745430,Joeytier,2012-11-20 23:55:00,3990,"I've done very well with the ripple shads up here as well.  Paddle tails in general seem to work exceptionally well for walleye.  Never saw the need for the trailer, mind you I'm usually running the 3"""
745477,mike rousseau,2012-11-21 07:17:00,4661,I'm casting as I drift... I though I'd try the stinger and see if it hung me up and it didn't... So why not use it... A few of the fish only had that hook in em.... And even with it I missed a few...
745491,manitoubass2,2012-11-21 13:01:00,11391, With the fish you catch it obviously isnt hurting  I like to cast and drag these baits     
745743,LeXXington,2012-11-22 14:33:00,1928,If anything that does look cool.  Have to try that.  Thanks for sharing
745748,LucG,2012-11-22 15:20:00,779,"I use this rig all the time for almost any species, all you have to do is adjust the size.  I never though of running a stinger though, good idea for when their short striking. I usually used a longer shanked hook for the larger sizes.  Thanks for sharing!"
