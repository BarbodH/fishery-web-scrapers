742630,Canuck2fan,2012-11-08 02:56:00,1444,A lot of good points but everyone is missing the most important part of this new deal.... Will Mariko still have a show and are abu's bikinis skimpier than shimanos? Lets focus on what is really important here LOL.
742632,manitoubass2,2012-11-08 03:31:00,11391," lol, love the sarcasm.   "
742641,bobowski,2012-11-08 04:50:00,360,"Not sure if they are even currently making new episodes of that show. Everytime I see it on WFN it seems to be the same couple of episodes. She isn't as experienced as an angler as I thought she would be seeing as who her father is.  On a side note, does anyone know where I can find any old episodes of The Red Fisher Show? He sounds like quite the guy and unfortunately im a bit too young to have seen any of his shows while growing up. I search around a little but I was unable to find anything."
742645,adolson,2012-11-08 06:41:00,783,I used Whiteout to sign my name overtop of his. Now I own the only Dana Olson signature Shimano rod ever made! It's not a bad little rod for the price.
742656,Rod Caster,2012-11-08 12:58:00,5784,  We need to get you a jacket loaded with bumper stickers now. Think of Ben Woo.   I'd like to thank Bob for validating all of my Abu purchases. Finally I'm at ease knowing I made the right decision
742657,Harrison,2012-11-08 13:07:00,2202," Wouldn't mind finding out where to find some episodes as well.  I remember watching it with my Dad followed by the show ""Wok with Yan"" that guy made me laugh.  As for the Izumi production company moving over to Pure Fishing, it's all business and business relationships.  I think this is a great move for both companies personally."
742658,hammercarp,2012-11-08 13:13:00,964, Yessiree Bob! 
742677,belippy,2012-11-08 19:35:00,88,I can't imagine how you get use to Abu's rod after you've been using NRX for a while!
742679,fishingwithbob,2012-11-08 19:40:00,123,"    ""get your chinese fishing net"""
742723,Dan668,2012-11-08 22:03:00,1120, Agreed. Love my nrx rods
742743,GBW,2012-11-08 23:50:00,8460,"ya know Abu is slang for more bum...  back to the matter at hand.  I too miss Wok with Yan and then the old dude after named Pascualie (SP?) doing his cooking show.  ""if you don't knowa the words just say 'la la la' with the tune""  HAHAHA!"
742750,kickingfrog,2012-11-09 00:03:00,8333,Wonder if Robert will be having a garage sale to get ride of all that nasty no good shimano gear.
742829,Duckie,2012-11-09 02:52:00,305,"Loomis and Shimano's, like all the other hosts LOL   "
742841,fishinguypat,2012-11-09 03:30:00,547,"Yup, its all about the King Harolds"
743006,Slop,2012-11-10 04:19:00,151,"I wish Bob all the best in his new business arragement. This is a man that has forged  an iconic career and brings entertainment,knowledge and a life's work to the sport we all enjoy.  I really don't see a problem with that."
743048,GBW,2012-11-10 15:40:00,8460,same
743049,Grimace,2012-11-10 15:41:00,2020, That sums up my feeling on the subject perfectly.
743056,ketchenany,2012-11-10 16:28:00,3229,"  GBW, the OLD dude is still on in reruns on OMNI 1 and CityTV!"
743059,SlowPoke,2012-11-10 16:41:00,2984,What ever happened to those lucrative Nissan sponsorships?
743121,Moosebunk,2012-11-11 01:46:00,3970,"As far as Bob's concerned I'll agree with Slop.  But yeah, Lew certainly makes a good point as well."
745533,GBW,2012-11-21 18:04:00,8460,just noticed they are now on sale at sail SHIMANO Bob Izumi Rod Clearance: Starting at $39.99 Regular price: Starting at $59.99
745543,John,2012-11-21 18:23:00,2956," No lie's Sinc....""second to none"" is a very generic statement that can't be construed as comparing attributes of one brand vs another. In the marketing game you take whatever opportunities arise, assuming of course you have checked with legal to make sure you can't be sued.  Izumi will be just fine..."
742546,ecmilley,2012-11-07 21:20:00,2163,yup after all these years as a shimano pro staffer bob has signed with abu
742547,GBW,2012-11-07 21:21:00,8460,"Wow, so the old rod's should be going on sale at CTC then real soon..."
742549,davey buoy,2012-11-07 21:25:00,5505, It's all about a paycheck. Your only married as long as the money comes in. Lots of good equipment out there now. A fella has to pay the bills!
742552,ketchenany,2012-11-07 21:30:00,3229,  I'll ask this weekend.

742558,fishnsled,2012-11-07 21:39:00,3520,"Wed, 11/07/2012 COLUMBIA, S.C. - Abu Garcia® has signed one of the biggest names in Canadian fishing by inking Izumi Outdoors Inc. producer of Bob Izumi’s Real Fishing television show. Izumi Outdoors Inc. joined the Abu Garcia team in a multi-year deal that was signed today. This decision comes in an award-winning year for Abu Garcia.  The company strives for excellence with the release of their third generation of Revo low profile reels. “I am incredibly excited about working with Abu Garcia and am so impressed with just how smooth their reels are,” said Izumi. “The reels are simply great in how they look and function. As a tournament bass angler, the Revo reels have incredibly powerful drags and a full line of matching rods, which are second to none.”  “It’s great to see Bob so enthusiastic about our products. He will be an incredible asset to our Abu Garcia team,” said Chris Hockley, Canadian Marketing Manager for Pure Fishing. “Bob Izumi is Canada's best-known and most sought after contemporary fisherman. He is the country's most successful tournament fisherman, respected author, seminar speaker, conservationist, television personality and radio show host.”  For over 25-years Bob Izumi has shared adventures with anglers across North America and around the world through his television division, magazine department, Real Fishing Radio show and realfishing.com. Bob Izumi's top-rated Real Fishing Show is a unique blend of entertainment and information that brings some of the world's greatest fishing to the small screen, from the high Arctic to South America, in freshwater and salt.  For more information on Izumi Outdoors visit Bob Izumi’s Real Fishing and for additional information on Abu Garcia visit abugarcia.com.  There is a lot more to this story I'm sure with the departure of Shimano that we will never hear. (Davey buoy made a good point)  Wish Bob all the best with his new sponsorship."
742565,kickingfrog,2012-11-07 22:09:00,8333,It's a two way street. Maybe Shimano wanted to go in a different direction.
742566,davey buoy,2012-11-07 22:09:00,5505," Money,security,maybe likes the stuff?,it is what it is. I'm sure given the money at stake(which I don't know) You or I would of done the same thing,I would think."
742568,kickingfrog,2012-11-07 22:12:00,8333,"I do own some abu reels, but haven't picked up one of their rods in a loong time so I can't comment on the rod quality."
742569,BucktownAngler,2012-11-07 22:15:00,582," thats what hes paid for, id expect no less"
742575,kickingfrog,2012-11-07 22:22:00,8333,The second to none comment could still be used as a vague statement re bang for buck and/or technique specific options and price points.  If someone is paid by a company anything said has to at least be taken with a grain of salt.
742576,musky_hunter,2012-11-07 22:25:00,328,"Abu's reels are great. Love the new lineup, the new stx is a awesome reel at a low price of $199.  Their rods on the other hand suck balls. They need to improve on the weight distribution and handles.   "
742578,lew,2012-11-07 22:29:00,12766,"Any time I've ever wanted to purchase a new piece of fishing or boating gear and needed some info on it, I've always come here to OFC to ask the board members and get an HONEST opinion.  Last person I would ever ask for an opinion on a product is someone who's paid to promote the item, whether it's a top of the line guy like Izumi, or one of the reps at the Sportsman or Spring Fishing Shows who's shirt is covered in company logos.  When a man is paid to promote a product, you'll only get the info the company wants him to give you....IMHO"
742581,outllaw,2012-11-07 22:37:00,1232,LEW no sugar on that one. but its the honest truth lol. gotta love it.
742582,captpierre,2012-11-07 22:38:00,2521,Exactly.  Huge conflict of interest.  I'm still a Shimano guy
742583,Duckie,2012-11-07 22:44:00,305," its okay. I'm sure Bob is too.  I used to laugh at the old TNN shows like Roland Martin, Bill Dance etc.  Roland used to promote spiderwire rods and reels (Mitchell) and Bill used to promote Quantumn..  yet on the floor of their boats you could see the odd unmistakable green of a Curado reel every once and a while lol"
742584,Roy,2012-11-07 22:49:00,13728,"Bob Izumi is a good guy. Dude with a good heart and knowledgeable.  I just don't like the Jarden Corporation. Twenty three thousand employees worldwide and brands like: Abu Garcia®, Aero®, Berkley®, Campingaz® and Coleman®, ExOfficio®, Fenwick®, Gulp!®, K2®, Marker®, Marmot®, Mitchell®, Penn®, Rawlings®, Shakespeare®, Stearns®, Stren®, Trilene®, Völkl® and Zoot®; Consumer Solutions: Bionaire®, Crock-Pot®, FoodSaver®, Health o meter®, Holmes®, Mr. Coffee®, Oster®, Patton®, Rival®, Seal-a-Meal®, Sunbeam®, VillaWare® and White Mountain®; and Branded Consumables: Ball®, Bee®, Bernardin®, Bicycle®, Billy Boy®, Crawford®, Diamond®, Dicon®, Fiona®, First Alert®, First Essentials®, Hoyle®, Kerr®, Lehigh®, Lillo®, Loew Cornell®, Mapa®, NUK®, Pine Mountain®, Quickie®, Spontex® and Tigex®  But hey, that's just my opinion."
742585,craigdritchie,2012-11-07 23:01:00,1586,That's about the most accurate and truthful thing that's ever been written on this board.
742592,Joeytier,2012-11-07 23:33:00,3990,"LOL!  Poor guy.  That's worse than when Fish TV got switched to Legend Boats LOL!  Fishing show hosts are not educators, but product pushers in the truest sense and can't think of many shows still going that promote the sport at its most basic level, and why I almost never watch fishing programming anymore.  I wish I had lived to see the Red Fisher era."
742594,bigugli,2012-11-07 23:41:00,6138,"Red may have been souped a lot of the time, but he was great to watch and listen to."
742596,hotsky,2012-11-08 00:04:00,400,
742600,Steve,2012-11-08 00:16:00,2075,"we all think it was due to money.  what about the fact that shimano has sunk so far on customer service its almost to a level of embarrasement.  from the loomis clusterfuhk (nrx) to the horrible return policies (TC4 crucial crankbait rod sent for warranty in July 2012 - still not back) to the horrible downgrade in reel qualities (curado and chronarch and calcutta to name a few) to the corkless shimano line of rods ... man ... it can go on and on.  new stradic Ci4 reel (4000) size that drag blew on first salmon (i'd assume the 4000 size would handle a salmon) ...  shimano is having serious issues, both on quality, and customer service.  maybe a guy like Bob doesn't want to be associated with a company that is taking every measure to reduce quality in order to reduce price any longer?  i'm sure money was a factor, but shimano's quality, or lack thereof, on recent product developments, may have been a factor as well."
742614,Duckie,2012-11-08 00:55:00,305,"it could be. Shimano has fallen a long way from even just a few years ago.  and I am a shimano guy. I just try and buy as much of last years models as I can.  cause the new stuff is not nearly as good as the older models.  and they insist on putting EVA foam on everything, from rod handles to reel handles. ugh.  and yet the prices continue to stay the same or go up.."
742622,craigdritchie,2012-11-08 01:55:00,1586,"Hate to break it to you, but Red Fisher's day job was tackle salesperson. He worked for a company that distributed fishing tackle, including Eppinger (the ol' five of diamonds!) and Mitchell reels. He also became associated with Mercury outboards - his job was to sell them to fishing camps. Red's TV show was created specifically to provide a way of showing the product in use to a wide audience. Red was soft-sell, not like today's guys. He simply showed the product being used and left it that, he didn't wear logo clothing or push things too much. But make no mistake, his show was all about selling product. Red told me that personally.  Uh, yeah, sure, whatever. But follow the money and you'll never be wrong."
742626,BillM,2012-11-08 02:19:00,17367,What do I need to do for some free hooks??!?!?!  /sells soul.
