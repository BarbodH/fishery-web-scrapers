745376,Christopheraaron,2012-11-20 18:29:00,3525, And how many of the current jays were playing for us in 2008?
745384,Brettiop,2012-11-20 19:02:00,279," I think only two....  Cassey Jansenn Jason Frasor(although he may sign elsewhere)   Why does that matter though? Gibbons is / was respected manager when he was here. HE isnt afraid to take control of a situation when needed, just because we have new players doesn't mean they aren't going to respect him as well...  Listening to his former players rave about how much they liked playing for him sure helps me believe that this guy is going to be a good fit here...."
745385,Guest ----,2012-11-20 19:02:00,0,"Not sure what to think about Gibbons being back.....has to be better than Farrel. At least when guys make mental mistakes you know Gibbons will make sure they don't happen again. Farrel was more worried about sipping his red wine and lining up his ""dream job."" I liked Cito...but he seemed to lack something.....maybe he was just too old school with his managing style. Same 8 position players most games and rarely using his bench. in any case I can't wait for spring training."
745386,Guest ----,2012-11-20 19:04:00,0,Bautista was there in 2008 wasn't he?
745394,fishing n autograph,2012-11-20 19:32:00,2540,"According to a whole bunch of guys on the team, if Gibby hadn't confronted Hillenbrand there was a line up of guys on the team that wanted to take him out back"
745396,fishing n autograph,2012-11-20 19:33:00,2540,Cito lacked personality. Guys who have been interviewed said he was too aloof
745397,fishing n autograph,2012-11-20 19:34:00,2540,Heard the other day that Lawrie was spoken to by several guys in the locker room... He needs to be straightened out
745417,Guest ----,2012-11-20 22:28:00,0,I guess he wasn't there till later in the year....just heard him on the fan......just missed Gibbons by a few months....
745419,davey buoy,2012-11-20 22:37:00,5505,"It's great the Jays are finally doing something!!. The Argo's now,a legitimate shot at winning the Grey cup. If or when hockey get's back,Burke,time to step up please. I think just wishful thinking on my part but wouldn't that be sweet?."
745457,Marko,2012-11-21 01:43:00,854,Good thing Lilly is off the team then lol. NOt a fan of Gibbons...its not very often that teams signs a coach that already left once for whatever reason
745501,Brettiop,2012-11-21 14:52:00,279,"I guess Lind was there back in 08 as well...  These guys had nothing but good things to say about him http://www.sportsnet.ca/baseball/2012/11/20/brady_lang_jays_arencibia_gibbons/  I hope this works out, certainly going to be an easy scape goat for the fan base if the team has a slow first month or two..."
744611,dobee,2012-11-16 20:19:00,301,awesome! its about time a Toronto team spent some $$ - if you build it they will come!  take note burkie
744612,kickingfrog,2012-11-16 20:22:00,8333,  Rumours are he would have asked/got 4 years and over 50 million dollars before he failed the cup test.
744613,kickingfrog,2012-11-16 20:24:00,8333,  He may be a lot of things but he does spend the money (max to the cap) and they do come (ACC is full).
744615,BucktownAngler,2012-11-16 20:36:00,582," with the numbers he was putting up pre-failed test, he wouldve gotten paid for sure.  plus hes still young.  the short deal puts pressure on him to perform well if he wants a big pay day when his deal is up"
744620,jedimaster,2012-11-16 21:01:00,3472,Even I will admit the Jays are starting to look interesting...
744621,kickingfrog,2012-11-16 21:01:00,8333,Someone twitter had this:  
744623,fishing n autograph,2012-11-16 21:15:00,2540, They can't okay until all the physicals are done.... Reyes is on vacation in Dubai
744624,mercman,2012-11-16 21:25:00,7054,  Dave !!!  How R ya bud ?!!!!
744625,fishing n autograph,2012-11-16 21:32:00,2540,Thumbing my nose at redsoxnation!
744681,Twocoda,2012-11-17 02:31:00,4130,Interesting read...  http://aol.sportingnews.com/mlb/story/2012-11-16/mark-buehrle-pit-bull-ban-blue-jays-marlins-trade-ontario-jeffrey-loria
744702,Dave Bailey,2012-11-17 04:20:00,1641,"Unlike some I've heard on the radio, I'm not worried about Cabrera's post-drug performance. Testosterone may give you a bit more oomph, but it doesn't give you a good eye for the ball or the timing needed to make good contact (although with a bit less strength he may need to adjust his swing a bit). He will drop a few points off his average, but if he can manage anywhere near .300 he'll be a fine addition."
744842,fishing n autograph,2012-11-18 05:22:00,2540,He's a career .300 hitter before he tested positive
744854,Billy Bob,2012-11-18 12:45:00,5865," This is a REAL threat that could impact the trade....they talked about yesterday on our sports radio station in depth yesterday...he has 4 dogs he  will not let go of, and I don't blame him...Ontario needs to get their act together on this."
744860,Dave Bailey,2012-11-18 13:38:00,1641," I was referencing last year's performance, I believe he was around .345 or somewhere."
744964,lookinforwalleye,2012-11-18 22:56:00,4399, 
745182,davey buoy,2012-11-19 21:20:00,5505," Great to hear Sin,and you too:clapping:What about the pit bull issue with one of the pitchers? I think he was a pitcher?"
745185,davey buoy,2012-11-19 21:28:00,5505," Thanks for the run down,glad your back!!"
745187,jedimaster,2012-11-19 21:36:00,3472, He was using before he tested positive....
745270,BucktownAngler,2012-11-20 02:42:00,582," postive or not, the juice doesnt help you hit the ball.  Ryan Braun tested positive last season for the same substance as Melky.  this year when he's clean, he matches or beats his seasons stats from the previous year when he was juicing  his 2012 clean numbers 108 Runs 41 HRs 112 RBIs 30 SBs"
745308,Billy Bob,2012-11-20 11:15:00,5865,"Mark Buerhle says he's going to live in Buffalo or N.F. NY.....say's he'll never get use to saying ""eh"" all the time and of course his dogs...."
745311,solopaddler,2012-11-20 11:42:00,8605,I can't believe they hired Gibbons. Shocked actually. Is that the best that they could do?
745333,Christopheraaron,2012-11-20 14:25:00,3525, I was hoping for alomar or butterfield.
745346,Brettiop,2012-11-20 15:55:00,279,I like Gibbons for the job...never had a problem with him when he was here last...
745354,fishing n autograph,2012-11-20 16:09:00,2540,Contrary to popular belief the players liked playing for Gibby more than cito. JP screwed Gibby over. He's a very well respected manager
745356,fishing n autograph,2012-11-20 16:11:00,2540," According to AA he's working with Buerhle about his dogs... Translation, bring them over and we will take care of the legal fees lol"
744088,BucktownAngler,2012-11-14 21:11:00,582, They need one at either 1B or DH  Edwin cant play both.
744113,bobowski,2012-11-14 22:04:00,360,Very true.I would love to see them acquire a big left handed bat. Fielder would be nice to have right about now. Maybe they can take a shot at Hamilton.
744115,kickingfrog,2012-11-14 22:24:00,8333,Hamilton is a big bat but I don't want to sign a guy to a >100 million dollar deal with his baggage.
744131,BucktownAngler,2012-11-14 23:22:00,582, i agree  i heard he wants A-Rod money
744141,fishing n autograph,2012-11-14 23:42:00,2540,Buck is not the same catcher he was when he was here last time. He hit .196 last year
744155,bobowski,2012-11-15 00:17:00,360, I heard that he wants something in the neighbourhood of 7 years at 175 million. He will never get that.
744161,kickingfrog,2012-11-15 00:35:00,8333," Baseball has some huge salaries and he may vary well get that,"
744176,BucktownAngler,2012-11-15 01:12:00,582, more then likely  thats the around the range that Prince fielder got paid
744177,jedimaster,2012-11-15 01:14:00,3472,  OR... a fisherman too busy to watch a 7 hour baseball game in prime fishing season.
744178,Christopheraaron,2012-11-15 01:15:00,3525, And he can barely WALK around the bases LOL!
744196,bobowski,2012-11-15 02:50:00,360," I would never watch a 7 hour baseball game and I don't fish 162 days from April to October so I have a little bit of time to tune in. Nothing like listening to the Jays game on the radio during a warm Saturday afternoon out in the boat.  ""And he can barely WALK around the bases LOL""  you can crawl around the bases when you hit a homerun."
744197,Christopheraaron,2012-11-15 02:53:00,3525, WOW! I didn't know every one of his hits was a homer!
744218,fishing n autograph,2012-11-15 08:09:00,2540,Hamilton will never get that kind of money. He's a high risk investment with his personal issues and the fact that he quit on the rangers
744225,snoil,2012-11-15 12:26:00,139,36 hours and the trade hasn't been okayed by MLB yet and apparently they don't like it.
744254,Dave Bailey,2012-11-15 15:28:00,1641,"I would keep Eddie at 1st, he's proven he can do the job. He showed when he was E5 that he can't throw worth a damn, but when does a first baseman ever need to throw? He can scoop balls out of the dirt, which often seems to be the main job of any guy handling that position."
744257,Dave Bailey,2012-11-15 15:37:00,1641," Okay, THAT'S a good one!  I might steal it..."
744296,kickingfrog,2012-11-15 17:45:00,8333," That makes perfect sense in the world most of us live in, but he only needs 1 out of the 30 teams to get it and year after year they have shown a complete lack of common sense and restraint."
744303,Grimace,2012-11-15 18:08:00,2020,Bud Selig is looking for a way to ruin this.  Has already expressed his sympathy for the Marlins' fans and will take everything into consideration before he makes a decision on approving the deal.  If he does not approve this deal I am going to vomit.
744309,kickingfrog,2012-11-15 18:36:00,8333,Vomit is what I thought I was going to do the first time I saw that awful new ballpark in Miami that looks like a tribute to 70's Vegas. Built with public money of course.
744331,bobowski,2012-11-15 21:03:00,360," If this trade is vetoed, it will be the first since Bowie Kuhn vetoed the trade of 3 all-stars for straight cash in the '70s. There's NO precedent."
744340,kickingfrog,2012-11-15 21:28:00,8333,Considering the red sox/dodgers trade this summer mlb can't step in on this trade. They may want to make it look like they are giving it some consideration and make sure that it doesn't look like they just rubber stamp everything that comes across the desk.
744354,Grimace,2012-11-15 22:06:00,2020,I think you lads are right.  I am stepping back off the ledge.  :-)
744528,Billy Bob,2012-11-16 12:18:00,5865, I believe there are several that were not approved.
744601,bobowski,2012-11-16 19:35:00,360,The Jays just signed Melky Cabrera! April cant come soon enough. Actually it can wait until ice fishing season is over.
744602,BucktownAngler,2012-11-16 19:39:00,582,"2 years 16 mil.  buy low, great deal.   so much potential from this team"
743809,bobowski,2012-11-14 00:06:00,360,"JAYS ACQUIRE FIVE PLAYERS INCLUDING BUEHRLE, JOHNSON   http://www.tsn.ca/mlb/story/?id=409433"
743814,Christopheraaron,2012-11-14 00:22:00,3525,"Thanks for the update Bob, this should give us a few wins."
743834,BillM,2012-11-14 00:47:00,17367,AL East is going to be stacked!!!!!!
743842,Grimace,2012-11-14 01:02:00,2020,Woo Hoo!!!!
743863,DRIFTER_016,2012-11-14 01:29:00,10439,Don't care!!! Haven't watched a game since the last strike. Was a big fan before that.
743871,uglyfish,2012-11-14 02:14:00,981,they'll still be on the outside looking in...
743872,speedtroll,2012-11-14 02:16:00,52,Nice  Rogers finally gets of their ASS I mean wallets. One 300 plus average hitter away from a world series appearance. what a starting line up now.
743893,Nipfisher,2012-11-14 03:08:00,2449,Buehrle was 13-13 last season...........? He was a great pitcher.I think Alvarez is the better option.
743898,kickingfrog,2012-11-14 03:36:00,8333,This doesn't assure a pennant by any means but it does show that the owners are willing to try to spend money and compete in a difficult division.  Some more moves coming… and now the team is more attractive to a prospective manager.
743902,LefroyFisherman,2012-11-14 03:49:00,602,"Great Trade, can't wait!"
743915,fishing n autograph,2012-11-14 06:00:00,2540,Quick everyone check your rogers bills... They have to find $162 million dollars to cover the trade hahaha
743916,fishing n autograph,2012-11-14 06:02:00,2540, Not true... Red Sox are getting older and have nothing in the farm system and believe it or not the Yankees don't have much money... They are so weighed down by back loaded contracts that they can't sign big free agents ( thank you Arod). And Tampa needs a few bats. It's gonna be interesting
743924,phatpelkey,2012-11-14 08:07:00,78,very excited now sign hamilton and were good to go
743952,Dave Bailey,2012-11-14 15:06:00,1641," I don't put as much stock in win-loss records as others do. A lot of it depends upon the team on the field, even a great pitcher will lose a ton of games if the rest of the team doesn't do its job. Win-loss records are perhaps the cruelest statistic in baseball. How often do you see a pitcher twirl a masterful game only to have the bullpen throw it away? Pitcher gets no credit for the win. And conversely, has there ever been a no-hitter in which there hasn't been at least one stellar play by a fielder to help it?"
743964,kickingfrog,2012-11-14 15:40:00,8333,"Agreed, Ricky R was 8-1 with awful stuff early in the season."
743999,BucktownAngler,2012-11-14 17:58:00,582,"Record is irrelevant..look at Felix Hernandez record the last few years. hes a Top 5 pitcher in the MLB  Buerle is Mr. Consistant, and hes been a AL pitcher for 12 seasons prior to last year.  May not be an ace, but youre not winning nothing with just an ace. (As Halladay has proven in the past)  You need a complete rotation"
744013,Brettiop,2012-11-14 18:48:00,279,"We now have a complete rotation that's for sure...Buerhle right now is miles better then Alvarez. Josh Johnson instantly becomes our staff ACE  This is a great trade for the blue jays, no doubt about that.  Now with 4 capable catchers on staff, we will see what AA does next!"
744016,BucktownAngler,2012-11-14 18:58:00,582,"id like to see JP shipped out.  have D'Arnaud as the starter (if hes ready) if not, John Buck as the starter  whos the 4th guy? Mathis was included in the deal"
744019,Brettiop,2012-11-14 19:03:00,279,"Bobby Wilson we picked up a month ago or so....nothing special but a capable backup   I'de be worried about shopping either JPA or Travis Darnaud.....If we do we better be getting a real impact player.  Travis especially, If he becomes the player people say he can be, watching him play elsewhere for the next ten years will be painful"
744023,BucktownAngler,2012-11-14 19:16:00,582," Forgot about Wilson. capable, yes.  i highly doubt D'arnaud will be the catcher they move. he's their highest rated prospect, and would have been called up last season if not for his injury.  in a perfect world, they package JP & Lind for a stud DH or 1B"
744032,Brettiop,2012-11-14 19:32:00,279, Yes that would be great!  The whole 'keeping JPA around because he knows our pitchers well' Kinda doesn't Apply anymore....
744079,BucktownAngler,2012-11-14 20:50:00,582,Bluejays reaction to the trade  
744080,jedimaster,2012-11-14 20:52:00,3472,If they make the play-offs I'll start to tune in again.
744081,bobowski,2012-11-14 20:58:00,360, sounds like the classic bandwagon jumper.   The last thing they need is a big bat at first base.
744084,kickingfrog,2012-11-14 20:59:00,8333,The bandwagon might be full by then.
