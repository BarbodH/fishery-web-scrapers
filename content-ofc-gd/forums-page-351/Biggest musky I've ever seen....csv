745315,BillM,2012-11-20 12:46:00,17367,That's a big big fish..  High 50in for sure.
745317,limeyangler,2012-11-20 12:51:00,5204,"""hey boys....we're gonna need a bigger auger""  :thumbsup_anim:"
745326,darsky,2012-11-20 13:46:00,586,ain't no csi but both facial expressions show heavy strain. I held out a 45lber once and after a few seconds it becomes not easy fast.Was it a local fish for you?
745360,mike rousseau,2012-11-20 16:34:00,4661,Yup
744808,mike rousseau,2012-11-18 01:29:00,4661,"Saw this picture in a tackle shop....  Owner said the fish bottomed a 60lb scale so they measured it before they released it below the ice....  ""He said"" it measured 65 inches!!!!  And I don't know about you guys but that's the biggest musky I've ever seen in a pic....  Don't know if its 65 inches.... But it's big....  "
744810,Skipper D,2012-11-18 01:33:00,1970,I think i know the guy in the picture ... lol .
744816,mike rousseau,2012-11-18 01:59:00,4661,
744827,cram,2012-11-18 02:52:00,1733,"Have never heard of a 65 inch musky, but that's a big one for sure."
744828,Freshtrax,2012-11-18 02:56:00,2215,Thats a huge fish.  I've only seen one bigger .
744829,cram,2012-11-18 02:57:00,1733,Just imagine that coming up through the ice.  What a catch.
744845,Skud,2012-11-18 05:36:00,739,That would look awesome on my wall! HUGE!!!
744846,bare foot wader,2012-11-18 06:20:00,1354,"georgian bay musky?  big fish, how recent was it caught"
744849,Handlebarz,2012-11-18 11:09:00,3790,that thing is huge must have been fun through the ice. Im guessing they were targeting pike through the ice? I ask as I dont know anyone who brings boga grips to go ice fishing or was it caught in a state that has ice fishing for musky? very cool I would love to target big fish through the ice
744853,davey buoy,2012-11-18 12:38:00,5505,Would be time to trade in my auger for a bigger one. lol. What a beast!!!!!!!!!!!!
744857,captpierre,2012-11-18 13:28:00,2521,"the second shot shows the width of the fish.  my guess, low 50s in length"
744866,outllaw,2012-11-18 14:23:00,1232,big fish. musta had spuded a large hole lol.
744867,Handlebarz,2012-11-18 14:25:00,3790,George we had to do that for lakers back in Sudbury days and its not easy with 3-4' ice
744869,mike rousseau,2012-11-18 14:37:00,4661,  I find the second pic shows its true size... If that fish were vertical it would be much shorter then that guy...  Who knows... Fish stories....   It was an accidental catch that was released.... A replica was made....  And the target species was pike and walleye....
744893,outllaw,2012-11-18 16:59:00,1232,mike. spudding 3-4 feet down would stroke me  out now lol..ice is for drinks not to stand on unless ya play hockey
744906,Gerritt,2012-11-18 18:45:00,6129,Would have made one hell of a chowder
744937,Jigger,2012-11-18 21:50:00,1237,I cant even get one that big when theres no ice...
744969,Crazy Ivan,2012-11-18 23:11:00,184,I think he's holding it away from his body and reaching for the camera in both pics. Makes it look bigger than it really is.
744974,Whitespinnerbait,2012-11-18 23:19:00,2038,Sure is one Freaking Huge Musky  :w00t:
744975,irishfield,2012-11-18 23:23:00,26272,"A magnificant fish, no matter the length.  Based on my 4 finger width.. it's a 56"" fish."
744984,SlowPoke,2012-11-18 23:50:00,2984,"Huge fish, very nice. I'm not sure I'd want to reach done that hole."
744987,kickingfrog,2012-11-19 00:04:00,8333, A hole is exactly what I would call that mouth. Beast.
745246,Rizzo,2012-11-20 00:55:00,4754,"that fish is stupid big...I give the guy credit for being able to hold it away from his body too, that's a lot of weight at an arms length!"
745261,trevy727,2012-11-20 01:59:00,351,"The guy holding the fish looks like a giant to me. The fish is huge and he's not holding it out at arms length. The first picture looks like he's got his elbow jammed in his hip just to hold it up and the second looks like he's losing it. I wouldn't doubt that fish being over 60"""
745301,Moosebunk,2012-11-20 04:18:00,3970,Four fingers is 56 inches Wayne.  You're awesome BIG man.  Solid muskie regardless the yardage of the thing.
