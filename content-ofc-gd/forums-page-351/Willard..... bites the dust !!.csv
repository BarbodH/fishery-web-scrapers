745860,Moosebunk,2012-11-23 01:28:00,3970,"Any mice in this house eventually get to the attic just above the garage.  Up there is a trap that only needs emptying twice a year.  They drown in anti-freeze and don't decompose/smell.  Since putting it up there, there hasn't been any need for any other traps in the house.  Paul... you've always got something weird to post."
