Well listening to the news tonight, the old delapitated file factory building was housing, a grow-op with 1800 plants with an estimated street value of 1.8 million, on the river side(east side) of the buiding you can still see the water line from the flood of 1980 and how far up the wall it actually went, the file factory building actually saved a good portion of the west side of the town in that area from been flooded. A little nostalgia on a very classic hole, that most of the early steelheaders of the 70s and 80s will remember fondly, sorta 2-parts to the story actually."
