744841,S.M.05,2012-11-18 05:02:00,145,"Finally purchashed my first place this fall and that meant the fall troutn would have to wait while the inspections were done, the bankers were pleased and the amendments were signed.  With all that I some how managed to squeeze some time in for my seasonal dose of fall specks.  I will keep the words short hope you enjoy the pics.                                                                                            Looks like its time to put my rods down and start work on the 10 acres I now call home."

744858,Roy,2012-11-18 13:30:00,13728,"That looks like a great place to settle down. In the 5th pic, the colours and markings on that fish are crazy! Really nice fish and pics, thanks for sharing."

744917,kickingfrog,2012-11-18 19:55:00,8333,Most beautiful freshwater fish.

744971,Walleye'm Fishing,2012-11-18 23:17:00,310,Fantastic pics and even better fishing. You sure know how to entice those big brookies on a consistent basis.
744978,S.M.05,2012-11-18 23:34:00,145," Thanks Roy. Each lake I visit have specks in various colors, traits and avererage size. That speck in the 5th pic is one from a special lake I fished this last winter, the only lake I have ever seen with this awesome bronze color.  Here is one from last winter. "
744979,Joeytier,2012-11-18 23:35:00,3990,Sure do.  They can be deceivingly dark and speck-ish in some lakes.
744985,S.M.05,2012-11-18 23:51:00,145," Thanks Bill. All from lakes stocked with specks. Although splake accidentally making into a speck lake is not unheard of, I would put my money on these being specs."

745178,blaque,2012-11-19 21:04:00,2419,"Beautiful fish and location.  Not many things better than a steak in the woods, and a tailgate dinner table"
745295,Moosebunk,2012-11-20 03:54:00,3970,"Mikey your pics are incredible bud.  Picturing you sneaking into one of your honey holes, soaking in the surroundings, then getting all stealth mode on them specks.  There's no one I know who stalks more backwoods troots than you man.  And it shows everytime in your reports.  We'll be hitting ice soon."
745336,adempsey,2012-11-20 14:43:00,1498,"Nice fish and great pics!   Definitely a tribute to some good Canadian fishing.  BTW, do you rent rooms?"
745449,MJL,2012-11-21 01:17:00,2427,Loving the pics! Just beautiful brookies
745468,Slop,2012-11-21 04:01:00,151,Congratulations on the new purchase Mike and also posting up some gorgeous photos. Hopefully I get to spend an evening on the ice with you this winter.....and it won't be for trout!....hahaha
