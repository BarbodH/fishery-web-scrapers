744698,blaque,2012-11-17 03:58:00,2419,I remember when friday nights were much more interesting than sitting at a vice covered in marabou  Can you guess what my hot color has been as of late lol   
744700,Garfisher,2012-11-17 04:11:00,229,I'm gonna say orange  Nice looking jigs you have there
744720,Moosebunk,2012-11-17 13:19:00,3970,Used to tie flies at work when it was slow up north.  Have thousands now that rarely see daylight.  Those steelie jigs though... have never done them with those exact hook/bead heads.  They look mint... nice job.
744721,Christopheraaron,2012-11-17 13:26:00,3525,"Nice! How do you fish them, I've been tying them too but don't know what to do with them?"
744722,Live2fish85,2012-11-17 13:26:00,1633,"Nice work. I love the flashabou, I tie it into a lot of my work."
744723,solopaddler,2012-11-17 13:33:00,8605,"Looking good bud! I fish many of the same systems you do and have always done well with white jigs.  Do yourself a favour though, seriously. Tie a couple up exactly the same way but make the collar chartreuse. For whatever reason that combination has been even more lethal for me."
744726,BillM,2012-11-17 13:56:00,17367, Just like you would a bag/bead.

744771,blaque,2012-11-17 20:08:00,2419," Thanks mike.....I'll definitely give that a shot. I've done contrasting thread b4 but don't think I've done chartreuse. Lord knows I've probably got spools full of it somewhere lol  Chris, As others have said just fish em under a float like you would anything else. I dig em cuz they get right down and don't have to mess around with as much if any lead shot. The less lead I have to crimp with my teeth the better!!!  And go figure, 90% of my fish today came on eggs or egg patterns lmao"
744779,kemper,2012-11-17 22:05:00,2232,"Those look dynamite.  I haven't been using jigs enough lately, but I've run out of roe and I think I'll just fish the season out without it. Some of those guys are in my near future at the vice, I think.  If I can stop tying spey flies that is..."
744780,misfish,2012-11-17 22:21:00,29133,I just put my jigs in my jacket for Sundays fish.  Those look great. Nice job.
745049,Aaron Shirley,2012-11-19 03:08:00,655,Very nice Blaque   I've done well jiggling the float occasionally in the drift with those as well and fly fishing with them.  I heard the trib I met you on last year is messed up right now. Is that true?
745100,blaque,2012-11-19 13:12:00,2419," Not sure what you mean by messed up.......I fished it twice in the last 2 weeks and the waters been in good shape. Was just there saturday.  If by messed up you mean, still a wack ton of guys fishing it, then ya its messed up lol"
745452,MJL,2012-11-21 01:21:00,2427,Very nice ties  I don't spend a whole lot of time now on the vice but I'm definitely itching to now.
745462,super dave,2012-11-21 02:36:00,323,"Those are very nice.  Do you Palmer the marabou or just pinch, measure and tie?  Lately I've been palmering but find the marabou is too long."
745519,blaque,2012-11-21 16:57:00,2419, I dont palmer the marabou......I do when i tie with rabbit strips. I hate tying with bunny strips lol
