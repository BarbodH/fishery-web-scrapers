Got out on the notty wed during the day, first time I have had the chance to drift a section of the notty.  The weather was fantastic and we had high expectations, unfortunatly the fish had other ideas and it was tough fishing the entire day.  One guy in our group landed 6, another lost 2 and I went 1-3.  Although the fishing was tough it was better then being at work!  Here is my one fish from the day! "
