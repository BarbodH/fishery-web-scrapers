Its certainly too early to be asking, that's for sure.  I am a williams whitfish addict. I catch most of my fish in there on that lure. I also like the macho minnows, pimples, and jigging raps. They all work.  The key with quinte is being in a spot where fish are going to travel thru. The fish there are transient. Always moving. So, setting up in a narrows, or location where there is a bottleneck will usually produce fish.  That's about all i can share with ya for now. Once we actually have ice, try again and someone will point you in the right direction.  S."

745154,Stoty,2012-11-19 18:21:00,2910,"Yes, Quite is def a year-to-year/day-to-day type of ice fishing place. There's a few ""community"" spots where you can walk-out from but again, depends on the ice. Hopefully the ice will be a lot better than last year. PM me later in the season when the ice is in, and I'll try and provide some info/safe spots to get out there."

Found that tipping swedish pimples with 2 whole emerald shiners and jigging along breaks from 10-15 ft. or 20-25 ft. etc... worked best. Jigging Raps. Williams wobblers, etc all worked. Seems you have to let lure settle on bottom then rip it up a few feet, let it flutter down and repeat. Different places all had there time from off Trenton, Belleville, Deserento. The Long Reach area seemed best from 20-25 ft when ice is safe. Dress warm and good luck."
