He was looking for a new bc reel, but couldn't get past the wall of obscenities and ""homegrown wisdom"" that hung in the air like cigarette smoke. Hopefully your buds bought enough stuff that day to offset the lost sales. Really, if you want to run a private club for the local ""we're the only non-idiots around here"" club, that's great. When you find yourself complaining that people don't shop locally, and support your business, try not to choke on that irony.  Yes, I do feel better. Thanks."

745924,grimsbylander,2012-11-23 11:48:00,3016,  That nicely sums up the frustration a lot of people experience. Well done.
