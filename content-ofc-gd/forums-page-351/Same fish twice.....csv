744676,mike rousseau,2012-11-17 01:51:00,4661,My brother broke off this walleye and about an hour later caught it... The other hook was still in his mouth and minnow in its belly....  Talk about putting on the feedbag.....

744682,mike rousseau,2012-11-17 02:33:00,4661,I did it once ever with a pike in Fort Francis.... Had my buddies spoon still hanging out of its mouth....
744704,northernpike56,2012-11-17 04:27:00,717,"I've done this too with an 8lb+ channel cat.. he swallowed a pike rig I had on with a big honking sucker minnow attached... about an hour later, my friend got something huge, and it was the channel cat with my pike rig in the back his mouth. pretty cool when that happens."
744707,Jigs,2012-11-17 06:28:00,136,"Wow that's pretty crazy.  During the pike tournament last spring I was casting spoons and caught a musky. He broke me off. I wasn't too happy because that spoon was working really well. About 20 minutes later I made another pass in that spot and caught him again, and got my spoon back."
744756,Sinker,2012-11-17 16:45:00,8692,"Yep, pretty cool eh?  I was trolling eyes one time, hooked into a pike, broke me off. Re-tied the same lure on, trolled by that spot again, and hooked the same fish. Got my lure back  Another time, jigging for eyes with minnows in the fall. My buddy sets the hook, has good weight, then snap.....gone. I dropped my jig down, thump, fish on. His jig was in the fishes mouth. He wasn't too impressed  S."

745199,Acountdeleted,2012-11-19 22:45:00,2562,"My buddy and I had that once with a bass on Quinte. I had it at around noon, it swam under the dock and broke off my line on the zebra muscles, 4 hours later my buddy catches the same bass with the hook in its mouth."
745781,fisher,2012-11-22 19:33:00,451, Reminds me of when I was younger and we used to go jigging in bars and I'd see my friend jigging with the same fish I had jigged with earlier....he too wasn't impressed when I told him.  Mind you I wasn't too impressed either when it was the other way around...
745867,mike rousseau,2012-11-23 01:47:00,4661,Happened again....  Tonight I was broke off drifting a big minnow for walleye.... An hour or 2 later I got her trolling... Still had the 6-7 inch minnow in its mouth....  I guess 30 pound braid isn't enough...lol
