745138,Gerritt,2012-11-19 17:50:00,6129,"In addition to my trolling rods I brought up a jigging outfit... a Spiel custom jigging rod made for me paired with a 2500 Stradic...  I laid it in the boat and after a while I noticed the busted off handle on top of the rod locker...... it had snapped off some how, the casted arm busted right above the handle.  Anyone know where I can just order a new handle, some one you can recommend?  thanks in advance  G"
745140,chris.brock,2012-11-19 17:54:00,4053,"I'd call Shimano, I'm pretty sure they will send you a new handle for no charge, I've heard they have excellent customer service"
745141,ccmtcanada,2012-11-19 17:55:00,7971,"Ok G...I can't lie to you...  I saw Fishsled with a hammer while you were backing the boat up at the launch.  He was mumbling something about a PB...a net...a few obscenities.  When I looked back again a minute later, he was smiling...I dunno  Seriously though...can't figure out how that happened!!"

745144,Gerritt,2012-11-19 17:59:00,6129, Thanks CB I will try   LOL!!!! its all good Cliff  Just want to get it back in operation... that little Stradic is one of my favs.... even when compared to my other stradics LOL...... I would steal a handle from the other ones.... but they are different colours  G
745145,GBW,2012-11-19 18:00:00,8460,If those scissors did that I need to get me some of those!  I would just call 1-877-577-0600 and see what Shimano can do.

745150,fishnsled,2012-11-19 18:09:00,3520,"    My Abu handle didn't break....just saying.  Other parts of me are in question though.   It is certainly weird how that broke - nothing dropped on it or stepped on it, waters were calm so it wasn't bouncing around in the boat. No idea how it happened. I'd try Shimano first and then try Aikman's.   Aikman A Sporting Goods Repair 3010 Novar Rd, Mississauga, ON L5B 1S4          Directions   905-277-3595"
745151,Gerritt,2012-11-19 18:13:00,6129," Thank Will, I know it was weird... no worries Im on the phone with Shimano as we speak... told me I had to take to texas    am now on hold after I told them I am in Canada lol  G"
745153,ccmtcanada,2012-11-19 18:15:00,7971, I hear Texas is nice this time of year! LOL
745155,Gerritt,2012-11-19 18:30:00,6129,"No luck with Shimano... called Aikman.... they will have something that will fit it.... however not the original.  called a place in Nova Scotia..They have the handle , Erics reel shop... 18.00 to my door including shipping  thanks everyone  G"
745157,fishnsled,2012-11-19 18:39:00,3520,Great news Gerritt.
745158,crappieperchhunter,2012-11-19 18:42:00,2582,I slipped on the ice a few years ago and fell on my reel   It broke in pretty much the same area. It is a Diawa reel. I just took the handle off another Diawa reel that I no longer use. It looks a little funny cause the handle is off another larger sized reel and is a different color but it saved my favorite perching reel for ice fishing. I still use it.  Check some old reels you don't use G. You might get lucky like I did.
745170,kickingfrog,2012-11-19 19:27:00,8333, I've never needed scissors to change a diaper.
745432,buckhorn250,2012-11-21 00:02:00,85,"I snapped the handle off my Curado...fell on it. Brought it to Shimano, told them what happened, expecting to pay for service. Thier response was unbeliable...""dont care if you fell on it, should not have snapped"" repaired it at no cost. Amazing customer service...Shimano customer for life."
745446,buick14,2012-11-21 01:04:00,741,Good old shimano.  Damn...uhhh I fell on my steez and need a new handle daiwa steez...response....ZZzzzzz  Shimano is great when you contact them...  I'm surprised and happy an old FH handle is only $18!!!! I paid near $90 for a calcutta dc handle recently (aftermarket look-alike) *shaking fist*
745701,Bondar,2012-11-22 05:18:00,817,"  i have one of those handles around here somewhere sitting in a box , but its off a lefty reel. I wouldnt Dare let it go to the dark (right) side of a reel"
