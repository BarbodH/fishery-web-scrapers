744207,Jet,2012-11-15 03:20:00,364,Beauty fish Mike! Been wondering about the Steelhead you've been getting into . . . nice to finally see some pics!
744246,Musky or Specks,2012-11-15 15:11:00,2710,Its nice to have a non polarizing poster in our midst. Those are some great fish Mike. 42 degrees is still warm I hated those December mornings when moving water was actually below freezing and you had to wait for the water temp to climb a degree or two for the fish to start moving.
744250,TJQ,2012-11-15 15:15:00,7806,Fish!!! and Beauty Fish too!!!
744253,fishnsled,2012-11-15 15:26:00,3520,A couple of beauties Mike! Nice report!
744255,Jds63,2012-11-15 15:29:00,1365,"Hey Mike , nice fish ... LUNKER !!!!!!"
744429,MJL,2012-11-15 23:55:00,2427,Those are tanks for sure Mike. Well done . Hopefully I can get some time off next week and hit the rivers again
744454,highdrifter,2012-11-16 01:02:00,2534," True.  I've found that the thinner wire ravens just don't cut it, even of 5 drennan tipet.  The Raven octopus strong seems like a better hook but it's a thicker wire than I prefer..  I'll have to give them a try though.  cheers"
744457,highdrifter,2012-11-16 01:06:00,2534, Nice.  That wide gap specialist pegs em every time!  Let's get out soon!
744458,kemper,2012-11-16 01:17:00,2232," I'm still searching for the right hook.  I should have mentioned that my landing record is absolutely awful this season. I'm hooking more fish than ever before, but pulling a ton of hooks.  Might be simply that I'm not so worried about landing them anymore, and most fish are on full lockdown as soon as theyre hooked up?  What I'm trying to say is I've been on a terminal tackle search ever since I went to the XST 3 piece for bigger water. I finally found a lead that I like, that seems to stand up to the abuse I give it, but hooks are still a challenge."
744459,BillM,2012-11-16 01:21:00,17367,"Kemper, are you straightening hooks or just popping them?  My hookup/landing ratio is pretty good..  If I get hooks into them, they rarely if ever come off.  Although my Loomis IMX and IM6 is nothing like that XST, lol!"
744463,kemper,2012-11-16 01:38:00,2232,"  I was straightening hooks, until I went to the octopus strong.  Problem is, they just aren't great and a lot of fish come unbuttoned after 5-10 seconds.  If I really try to fight the fish carefully I bank most of them, but the fight is so much better when you really put the boots to them on heavy equipment.  Next experiment is those Kamassans.  Sorry for the hijack Mike."
744465,kemper,2012-11-16 01:39:00,2232, Also have a new build in the works to tone it down a touch when I'm not on the big water... stay tuned for that one.
744484,Skud,2012-11-16 02:56:00,739,Good stuff. Working only two days a week sounds pretty sweet.
744502,DRIFTER_016,2012-11-16 03:35:00,10439, Those two days are double shifts though. Don't know if I could handle back to back 16 hour shifts.

744706,TDunn,2012-11-17 06:28:00,680,Wow! Now those are steelhead! Great report mike   TDunn
744719,Moosebunk,2012-11-17 13:15:00,3970,Very solid bows Mike.  Wouldn't expect anything less from ya.  Ti's your season!!!
744840,S.M.05,2012-11-18 04:46:00,145,Awesome chrome and great pics.
745027,Paulus,2012-11-19 01:49:00,522,"Sweet giant chromers, Mike! Thanks for sharing. Those fish naturally invite discussions about hook strength, for sure. Pulled hooks are possibly the number one cause of lost steelhead, at least in my own experience!  Daiichi are good but kamasans are the best IMO. I've tried other shapes than you suggest and have always had good results.  Of course, if you can get them on jigs, those bigger hooks are the best.  P.-"
745367,Ed Newton,2012-11-20 17:14:00,2,Beauty fish mike! Nice work
745379,ccmtcanada,2012-11-20 18:35:00,7971,I don't remember the last time I fished for steelhead....and I even have a pin now! LOL.  Still in the box it came in...  Gotta get out a few times this fall.  Awesome fish Mike!  You are the king!
744119,solopaddler,2012-11-14 22:50:00,8605,"The board has been kind of weird lately so I figured I'd do my part to help the situation with an actual fishing report.  Been steelheading like crazy this last little while, 5 out of the last 7 days and I'm headed out tomorrow for 2 more.  Fished some larger water today and managed a slew of big bright wild steelhead. Water temp was 42 degrees and all of the fish were caught in slower holding pools.  Despite the cold water temps, once hooked these fish went insane. Absolutely incredible power and speed.  The bulk of the fish were caught floatfishing, but everything was upsized. 12 gram float, 12lb main, 8lb Maxima Ultragreen tippet and quarter sized gobs of skein wrapped in pink and white scarfing.  Later in the afternoon I switched to hardware and caught several swinging a #4 spinner on a tight line down and across. The hits were pure electricity, totally savage.  Here's two of the better fish. I realize they look larger because of the hold, but still. The larger of the two was 351/2"" on the tape.  Looking forward to some more tomorrow.     "
744120,irishfield,2012-11-14 22:52:00,26272,Man that looks huge.. back away from the camera Mike!  Seriously... good to see you out and about. Doesn't your employer know why you're calling in sick!

744139,solopaddler,2012-11-14 23:38:00,8605,     Was great to meet you too Mark.
744140,aplumma,2012-11-14 23:39:00,6896,Awesome fish Mike but really what possess you all to think 42 F is water to stand in brrrr. I used to Race Jetskies in that temp range but it was in a drysuit and we engineered the heated engine water to spray on our gloved hands to keep them from freezing to the grips.   Art
744142,Twocoda,2012-11-14 23:42:00,4130,35.5 is a respectable fish...nicely done!
744143,esoxansteel,2012-11-14 23:44:00,1307,"Nice looking silver tanks there Mike, you better have the shoulder cream ready, cause a few more days of fish like like, and youll need it.  "
744144,kemper,2012-11-14 23:44:00,2232,"  I'll continue to stand IN it until it gets to 32F, at that point I retire because I hate standing ON water."
744148,Live2fish85,2012-11-15 00:00:00,1633,Awesome fish Mike. That second is a beauty. As well as the first but the length is crazy on that second.
744156,Rod Caster,2012-11-15 00:17:00,5784,"Fish! Woo-hoo! To someone who doesn't get spoiled with steelhead rivers, those fish look mighty tasty.  Do you often keep one or two for the table?"
744160,highdrifter,2012-11-15 00:28:00,2534,Sweeet chrome bud!!  I've lost a couple fish in the dime range lately..  Hooks would just bend right out..  Pray tell.. What hooks are you tying to your 8lb tipet??  cheers HD
744167,kemper,2012-11-15 00:47:00,2232," I can't speak for Mike, but I've been running almost the same rig this year and I've only found a few that will stand up.  Gammy Octopus in size 6 or better, and Raven Octopus Strong also in 6 or better."
744169,Christopheraaron,2012-11-15 00:49:00,3525,"Great fish there Mike! I've been out about 5 times in the last couple weeks and been skunked every time, teach me your art oh master!"
744174,solopaddler,2012-11-15 01:11:00,8605," Occasionally, yeah. Last week I kept a larger fish around 10lb's for the first time in a very long time. We were having a dinner party and it was a request.  I filleted it, rubbed it with a dash of cajun spice and garlic, bbq'd it on low heat and basted it with melted butter and maple syrop.   It was really good.    Kamasan B983's in 8 & 10.  I've used some of the wide gap Gamagatsu hooks and have never had luck with them, they constantly bend."
744183,corvette1,2012-11-15 01:38:00,1765,awesome fish mike congrats
744184,BillM,2012-11-15 01:39:00,17367,"Geez dude, 35.5in?  That thing is a monster!  As far as thick wire hooks, Diiachi X510 in 10's, 8's and 6's..   You'll never bend them regardless of tippet."
