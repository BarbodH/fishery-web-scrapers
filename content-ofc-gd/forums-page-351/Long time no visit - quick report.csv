Caught quite a few Smallies but the boy beat me up on size.      I did catch some too, LOL.    All caught on twister jigs or Zoom Lizards.   The next weekend we took one of my son's friends that never been out fishing before. Helluva first fish! He didn't stop talking about it for hours.    Picture still makes me laugh."
