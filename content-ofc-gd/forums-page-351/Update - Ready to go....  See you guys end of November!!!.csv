Last Wednesday afternoon, my brother went to our hunting grounds to drop 150LBS of carrots and to his surprise, the feeder had been cleaned right out    While he was dropping the food, got grunted by a buck     So all this to say that we are pumped to the max  Now I wait for him to pick me up... I'm as ready as I'll ever be    See you guys end of November TJunkie"

741809,tb4me,2012-11-02 23:53:00,3295,Good luck Jacques! But by the sounds of it you dont need it..
741811,aplumma,2012-11-03 00:03:00,6896,Good luck with the hunt bud. If you get skunked give a holler we can park you out on the front porch with a cup of coffee and a gun I bet even money the gun goes off before the coffee is cold.   Art
741812,Christopheraaron,2012-11-03 00:06:00,3525, Neighbors that bad eh?

741821,Slop,2012-11-03 00:25:00,151,No disrespect Jacques but I've never quite seen huntin' boots like those before.... and just one loaf a bread C'mon man!  Bon chasse!
742198,Leecher,2012-11-05 14:33:00,7832,"*** Update *** Got back last night and sadly, opening weekend was a bust  Lots of fresh tracks all over but they are moving around at night     We had snow early morning and rain during the day... weather wise not quite cold enough.  I must say that I'm quite comfy in the blind and very happy to have it   Spent roughly 16 hours in it this weekend   Leaving again this up coming Friday for a whole week and just can't wait   Thanks Paul!!!   Thanks Simon!!! It's a possibility   Thanks Ron!!!   Thanks Art!!!   Sounds like you have lots of them around   Thanks Terry!!!   Thanks Grant!!!   The boots   I'd look pretty with those on eh     There's actually two loafs in the box"
742209,misfish,2012-11-05 16:21:00,29133,Forcast looks favorable for this up coming weekend Jac.Hope they come out to play with me.  Cold nights and warming to +2 for the day high.  Good luck.
742247,Leecher,2012-11-05 20:36:00,7832," Yes Brian, the forecast looks a lot better for the up coming weekend   Below zero overnight but just above during the day over this way too   That should get them moving and also going into the full rut.... one of them, is bound to do a stupid thing     such as stroll by and stopping to catch it's breath   MAN I just can't wait  Good luck to you too this weekend B"
742316,tb4me,2012-11-06 02:56:00,3295,"Wow too bad, still better then a good day workin thou isint it...lol My good friend nailed a 8 point buck tonight..just text messaged me pics from the bush..It was a double lung shot that dropped it right in its tracks.."
742319,Leecher,2012-11-06 03:37:00,7832, You bet Ron    I'd much prefer put in 16 hours in the blind then work thats for sure   Awesome that your friend was able to bag an 8 pointer... well deserve high five from me  I still have a full week of hunting left... just hope I can set my sights on something like this... buck from my 2008 season... would make me very happy

742612,iFish4real,2012-11-08 00:46:00,386, I knew the one I shot had a twin brother
742629,Leecher,2012-11-08 02:49:00,7832, Merci Kevin!!! Il me reste encore une pleine semaine    Part Vendredi   Did you get to bag one iFish4real???  If so... AWESOME
742661,aplumma,2012-11-08 13:29:00,6896, Actually I have more deer than squirrels on the property the back 12 acres are all woods and brambles that we let grow out so the deer have food and shelter. The area I am in is Loudoun County Virginia and it has some of the highest deer populations in the USA. Besides around here all of my neighbors have guns and they will shoot back.lol.  Art
742668,Leecher,2012-11-08 16:23:00,7832, I kind of figured it was the case Art  If you don't hunt... better call your brother Joe
