745586,Rustic-Fisher,2012-11-21 22:42:00,826,"Keep your eyes open for any suspicious behaviour in regards to deer poaching in the ESSA area. Unfortunately i stumbled across a sight that made me sick. Tossed carelessly of to the side of a path leading to the river was a 275lb+ buck minus its head and rack , hooves. Kill was no more then two days old and cleanly shot. All avenues have been taken in regards to reporting, but every little bit helps. These types of crimes just boil my blood, and I hope yours. I decided to post a few pics just to drive home the reality of this senseless waste. The worst part about the whole thing...... my wife and 3 year old were with me, explain that to a three year old (and for guys that don't have kids, their smarter then you think)  Once again guys, If you see something suspicious dial  1-877-TIPS-MNR  "
745590,misfish,2012-11-21 23:03:00,29133,"Thats just plain sick.  Could you tell what Cal, was used?  Im thinking guys dressed for birds,but have slugs on hand."
745594,buckster,2012-11-21 23:18:00,530,Wow... What a shame!   Was this the kill site or was the deer discarded?   Possibly shot with an arrow?
745597,flippin,2012-11-21 23:25:00,34,"Either way if in fact it was killed by a person they should be ''CHARGED'' to the full extent of the law!! Crap like this is just disgusting!! However ''if'' this buck was already dead when someone found it and than removed it's parts, different story. The bucks, not all but some will ''fight'' till death. Many you tube vids on this. Lets hope thats the way this happened and no shot an left the meat. flip"
745600,Rustic-Fisher,2012-11-21 23:37:00,826," Brian, Looked to us like a slug wound, perfect shot placement.  100% SHOT!!! No questions. R"
745606,buckster,2012-11-21 23:58:00,530,That is what I was getting at lol   Shot and not found by hunter but maybe a passer by  helped themselves.   Regardless if shot  with a gun this was a poached deer!
745610,Rustic-Fisher,2012-11-22 00:06:00,826," I see what your saying, but as an avid hunter I have no doubt this animal was likely dropped on the spot or close to it. Shoot placement was perfect.  R"
745616,buckster,2012-11-22 00:28:00,530,I'm not doubting you.   Just asking the questions.   Stuff like this really grinds my gears.  People like this give hunters a bad name.  Haven't even seen a deer this season  with countless hours on the stand. Then you see this animal go to waste.
745628,funfishing,2012-11-22 00:58:00,147,"As a non-hunter, if I may ask, what value do the head and hooves have? Why would they have been removed? For taxidermy and show, or is there some monetary value? Why the hooves?"
745630,Rustic-Fisher,2012-11-22 00:59:00,826," Yep, my thoughts exactly , a week ago I would've given anything for a shot at a buck like this."
745632,BillM,2012-11-22 01:07:00,17367,That's brutal.
745635,flippin,2012-11-22 01:21:00,34,"ppl take the head (antlers)for their own trophy, legs can be made into lamps, and ashtrays. Thats the only reason they would take these at least thats what I know some ppl do with them. flip"
745647,Skud,2012-11-22 02:21:00,739,"About 15 years ago I found a 8 point buck dead in the bush several days after the shotgun hunt. The hunter must have shot it on the run because the slug entered the rear quarter and came out the stomach. It probably ran to far for the hunter to find. Anyway, I cut of it's head and the antlers are on the wall in my garage. A waste of meat I know but the weather was too warm and it couldn't have bled out properly so I didn't trust it to be edible."
745663,Sinker,2012-11-22 02:36:00,8692,"I'd like to think it was a deer that got away on someone, but ya never know. Even a well shot deer can go a loooong ways, and if it was raining, they're hard to track. Who knows.  S."
745664,SirCranksalot,2012-11-22 02:36:00,3291,"I saw a fresh deer hide left close to the road on a trail leading to the river but that was near Baxter.  I spoke to 2 grouse hunters who just came out of the woods. I understood from them that it was legal to hunt deer there right now, so I thought it was more like bad environmental practice or even 'littering', but not a crime."
745710,misfish,2012-11-22 11:14:00,29133," Cut from the knee joint down,there is some kind of medicine that can be made from that. I know this ,as a fellow co-worker who is vetinemise (sp?) did it. He asked for them if I got a deer on our hunt.He boiled the bones and hooves.    A quality antlered buck mount,goes for big dollars on the black market."
745712,misfish,2012-11-22 11:17:00,29133,"  Shane,the controlled hunt for this area, has been over for 13 days."
745722,BillM,2012-11-22 13:22:00,17367,That thing is going to smell good today.
745727,Sinker,2012-11-22 13:33:00,8692," I know, but I saw this on another hunting forum, and the poster says the hole is from a broadhead.  Like I said, who knows?  No sense jumping to conclusions.  S."
745739,misfish,2012-11-22 14:27:00,29133," Im sure it,s been nawed on over night. Would make a great spot to snipe some yotes.   Interesting Shane.  Thanks"
745744,Meegs,2012-11-22 14:43:00,249,"Ive found afew over the years in essa. Never with the heads removed, usually lost deer I figured but now starting to wonder.  Disgracefull"
745749,LucG,2012-11-22 15:23:00,779,"Its a shame to see such good table fare go to waste. Hopefully if there was something illegal done, the culprits get caught."
745774,Rustic-Fisher,2012-11-22 19:13:00,826,"Spoke with the CO today, his take was that it was possibly gut shot, claimed, and then hung.  Fearing the meat had spoiled they decided to ditch it . Still don't think it looked gut shot, but CO has seen more shot deer than I'll ever see . Was great to see how fast the MNR acted on this. Who knows how this all went down but at least it was investigated. And Brian, I gurrentee there's coyote snipers already sitting on this kill lol R"
745782,jimmer,2012-11-22 19:37:00,2730,They didn't even take the full shoulder cape for a proper mount. Probably just going to use the antlers from the head.
