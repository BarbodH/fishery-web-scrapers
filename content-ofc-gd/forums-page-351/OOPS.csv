743933,Oryx,2012-11-14 12:47:00,186,would it fit in one of the thule bags or yakima rooftop boxes?
743982,Fang,2012-11-14 17:19:00,1330,I have a nanook and it is a bit of a pull with snow. What I might look at is leaving those big comfy seats at home when you are car toting it and buy a couple of fold down stools from canadian tire.
744017,BucktownAngler,2012-11-14 19:02:00,582,"i googled the smitty sleds.  how do they attached the plastic sled to the smitty sled?  i see most of the smittys are collapsable, and not permanantly mounted"
744047,DRIFTER_016,2012-11-14 19:59:00,10439, Strap the hut on top of the Smitty Sled with a couple of cam or ratchet straps.
744904,Acountdeleted,2012-11-18 18:23:00,2562,"So good news, today with the help of my dad I was able to fit the ice hut half into the trunk of my car. A few bungees and rachet straps later and I was able to tote the hut around the neighbourhood with the greatest of ease. Should be good to go this winter."
744909,tater0025,2012-11-18 18:54:00,12,"I wouldn''t want to drive any distance in the middle of winter with my trunk half opened, besides the fact of trying to squeeze it in and out at the beginning and end of your trips. The 2 man flip is the way to go if you have a machine to pull it, but pulling them out on the ice with any amount of snow sucks. I know this isn't what you want to hear but I'd sell it and buy a hub style hut."
744957,buick14,2012-11-18 22:42:00,741, Lol X2
744981,landry,2012-11-18 23:37:00,1005, It will pull just fine with a smitty sled. But I would still sell it and get one that fit in my car.
744994,DRIFTER_016,2012-11-19 00:16:00,10439, Or sell the car and buy one the sled will fit in.
744998,irishfield,2012-11-19 00:26:00,26272,Yah.. that would make a lot more sense Dave!
745177,Stoty,2012-11-19 20:58:00,2910,"I have a Nanook and pull it by hand ALL the time, as I dont have a sled or ATV. It's really not bad at all. I've rigged mine up to be able to remove one seat when I'm fishing along, and that cuts the weight down a bit. As long as you have cleats you're fine dragging it by hand."
745207,buick14,2012-11-19 23:00:00,741,"  Shhhhh! We're trying to get him to buy a new car, or sell his hut....  You must mean pulling the nanook is easy, if somebody else pulls it for you...right?"
743478,Acountdeleted,2012-11-12 23:21:00,2562,"I know buick14 is going to rip into me tomorrow at work for this but I bought a Clam Nanook ice fishing hut over the weekend much to my joy. Can't wait to get out to do some serious ice fishing all over Ontario this winter.  The box was too big to fit in my car, it fit in the trunk but the space where the chairs fold down into the back seat is much smaller then the actual trunk (not sure why they do this). So on to the roof it goes.... my kayak goes up there anyways and has already scratched the roof beyond belief so thats no real problem there.  Got the hut home and put it together, was marveling over it, was tempted to even sleep in it and was showing it off to my dad when he says 'Thats great son. Now how are you going to get it to the lake?' I told him I was going to strap it to the roof again and he says 'Over the seats and the frame? It might not last very long if you do that.'  So has anyone had to strap a fold over ice fishing hut to the roof of their car before? Any tips or tricks so that I don't destroy the seats or the outter frame on my first trip? I'm really hoping that over this winter I might be able to get this back up to fushimi or Thunder Bay but I'm not so sure now.  Any advice greatly apreciated."
743479,sauce,2012-11-12 23:26:00,219,Get a pickup truck. Not sure why someone would spend that kinda money on a hut and not consider these things beforehand. If you can find some kind of rooftop travel bag that you can fit the hut in that might work.
743481,buick14,2012-11-12 23:34:00,741,"Jeremy Jeremy Jeremy.  Shoulda bought the popup clam 2000 or trekker max lololololololol!  I decided to rip in now instead!   Lol buy a small homemade utility trailer and slap on a dirty hitch to that garbage-can, then u can bring any toy you want!"
743482,Joeytier,2012-11-12 23:35:00,3990,"I'm going to go ahead and say that's a terrible idea.  And no, I have nothing productive to add...except for good luck."
743485,Live2fish85,2012-11-12 23:43:00,1633,Have fun slugging it through the snow with out a sled not a easy task.
743489,RickOnt,2012-11-12 23:47:00,669,"Jeremy  ""IF"" You get it to the Lake How are Ya gonna get it out there?  Rick"
743490,Freshtrax,2012-11-12 23:50:00,2215,"Put it in a hockey bag , thick canvas one."
743491,BillM,2012-11-12 23:52:00,17367,"Sell it and get a white bucket and a great heater, lol!"
743492,Acountdeleted,2012-11-12 23:55:00,2562,Ha ha thanks. If I get it to the lake I'll pull it out. Probably be a lot better then when I had a rubbermaid on top of a kids toboggan to haul my gear last week. (Next week on the Red Green show.......)
743494,DRIFTER_016,2012-11-12 23:56:00,10439," If he doesn't have a quad or sled he's goona have to build a Smitty sled in order to be able to get it out there. Google Smitty sled for more info.  I tried hauling my Trekker II by hand once (there was two of us) through 8""-12"" of snow. We hauled it about 1/2km to where we wanted to fish. It was freaking exhausting!!!!"
743495,ketchenany,2012-11-12 23:57:00,3229," I have lots of white buckets, just made wine!"
743500,Acountdeleted,2012-11-13 00:05:00,2562,I do those tough mudder obstacle courses in the summer. Belive it or not I'm actually looking forward to the workout of pulling the hut across the ice (no this is not an invitation for me to pull yours as well).  I have a few ideas I think I can try. I really like the idea of the big hockey canvas bag too. A little bit of experimentation and a trip to Home Depot this weekend and I should be up and running.......... I hope.
743502,Joeytier,2012-11-13 00:09:00,3990,"I've hauled Clam Nanook's by myself in 3 foot of snow before.  That sucked, but in light snow/bare ice it's really not bad at all if you're in decent shape [and you have cleets]."
743523,RickOnt,2012-11-13 00:55:00,669,"Hey Joey  Exactly!  In the right conditions its doable.  If your travel from Parking to Lake and Shore to the Spot and you do not do a lot of moving it will work.  However, For a walker who likes to be mobile,in most conditions, a smaller Clam, the Pro or Scout or a pop up works the best.  Rick"
743524,RickOnt,2012-11-13 00:57:00,669,As Drifter said the Smitty Sled will help!  Big Time!  Rick

743572,landry,2012-11-13 02:51:00,1005,  The smitty sled is a must!!!!!! Don't strap it on the roof!!!!!!!!!
743596,phatpelkey,2012-11-13 04:31:00,78,"this is a buddy of mine when he bought my old shanty, this is how he got it home  "
743597,Acountdeleted,2012-11-13 04:34:00,2562,"Yep, looks like I'll be doing something like that. How did he strap it down to the roof of his car?"
743631,ricoboxing,2012-11-13 13:07:00,398,looks like he is just using those ratcheted tie downs. I think it would be better if you just got a small 4x6 utility trailer and carried it there.
743636,BillM,2012-11-13 13:13:00,17367,Just lag bolt it through the roof!  (The small utility trailer sounds like the best bet)
743673,limeyangler,2012-11-13 16:22:00,5204,Surely something like this to get it to the lake   http://www.canadiantire.ca/AST/browse/4/Auto/VehicleRacksCarriers/RoofRacks/PRD~0401076P/SportRack+Complete+Roof+Rack+System+1.jsp?locale=en
743685,bare foot wader,2012-11-13 17:41:00,1354,"if you're not worried about scratching up the roof, just ratchet strap to the roof, interfers with head space and will drop water through the door seal if it's raining but it works just fine  for the price of a utility trailer you could get a good roof rack and save a few bucks"
743925,phatpelkey,2012-11-14 08:10:00,78, he just put the window down a little and hooked it on the window frame
743931,Acountdeleted,2012-11-14 12:07:00,2562,  The roof is already pretty scratched due to my kayak over the summer so its not a big concern. I was more concerned with putting pressure on the poles for the hut. Buick14 recomended turning the hut upside down and having the rachet strap pressure on the bottom of the hut. I think this might work best (I do have the cover that goes with it)
