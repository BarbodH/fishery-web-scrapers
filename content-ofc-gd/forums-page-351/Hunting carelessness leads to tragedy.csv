744815,bucktail,2012-11-18 01:59:00,1857,I cant even comprehend how you make that mistake in a wide open field. I watched 4 does at the same distance today at 8:10 am and I am almost blind in one eye and there is no problem??????? what the hell
744879,ch312,2012-11-18 15:35:00,1590,"i've been atving on the reserve for a few years now and know a few people out there, including the people that live beside the field where this happened.  none of the hunting rules that apply to us apply to the reserve. therefore, the victim was legally bowhunting on sunday even though archery was closed in the area until monday, the day after the controlled hunt ended. he was not wearing orange because it's not required on the reserve during our controlled hunt. on the reserve, natives are allowed to hunt with whatever firearm they choose, whenever they want, for whatever they want. all of the natives i've spoken to claim that's it's 100% legal to hunt from roads on the reserve and i have no reason to think otherwise. they're also allowed to use spotlights and rifles aka ""jacking"" at night for deer.  ZERO excuses for this happening regardless of what you're local rules say."
744880,ch312,2012-11-18 15:39:00,1590,  he was using a scoped rifle and the general consensus on the reserve (after talking to 5 or 6 natives yesterday) is that this was not an accident as people are fully aware of the shooters issues...
744903,K_F,2012-11-18 18:20:00,107,"  Correct, but Kosid would have been governed by MNR regs, as I don't believe he was from six nations."
744907,HTHM,2012-11-18 18:50:00,4082,I don't know if that would be the case. My understanding is that MNR regs do not apply to a reserve. They are considered to be a separate jurisdictional territory as I understand it. It is an interesting question though...
744921,pics,2012-11-18 21:00:00,1268,Kind of ironic that the native was using a bow while the non native used a rifle. I'm ok with trditional hunting rights as longf as traditional methods are used. I really don't think it was intentional. Did the bowhunter have a set of rattling antlers?. Was the scope a cheapie or was drinking involved??? Let's hope the truth comes out so it doesn't happen again.....
744924,Sinker,2012-11-18 21:09:00,8692," You have it backwards. The native was using the rifle, non native the bow.  S."

745121,ch312,2012-11-19 15:48:00,1590," like i said, ""our"" rules do not apply as soon as you cross onto six nations land. but, seeing as non natives aren't suppose to live on the reserve, i'm not sure if a non native is even permitted to hunt there or not. i'll have to get back to you on that one as i'd love to hunt out there."
745131,G.mech,2012-11-19 17:24:00,830,  You would still hunt there after this???  Keep your head down!!
745133,skidoosafari,2012-11-19 17:40:00,46," The hunter that was shot did have permission to hunt that area from the land owner. I have never had any issues on the reserve,have never felt that my life was in danger. Hunting accidents happen every year. Regardless of were it happens it is a terrible tragedy."
745382,ch312,2012-11-20 18:46:00,1590," if you saw as many yotes, turkey, and deer as i have out there in the last couple years you'd wanna hunt there too. the shooter in this incident shouldn't have had a firearm in the first place and this could have easily happened anywhere. the natives i know can't remember the last time someone was shot while hunting out there.   i really need to look into hunting on the reserve. would a non native follow the normal MNR regulations?"
745422,misfish,2012-11-20 23:14:00,29133,"  From what I read and told,YES"
745423,BillM,2012-11-20 23:20:00,17367,"If you're not native, you're not all of a sudden going to be granted native status hunting rules ones you step foot on the rez, lol.   Yhat rez is still in a WMU, those are the rules you'd need to follow."
744021,HTHM,2012-11-14 19:08:00,4082,"From the Hamilton Spectator:  Veteran outdoorsman Peter Kosid has been killed in a hunting accident on the Six Nations Reserve.  Six Nations police found the 28-year-old in a field east of 2907 Third Line Road around 8 a.m. Sunday.  Sabina Marrone said her fiancé was hunting on the property of a family friend when he was shot in the back.  Police said another deer hunter fired into the trees from the road, hitting a male bow hunter about 375 metres away.  The investigation continues with the help of OPP forensic experts.  Six Nations Const. Derrick Anderson said the shooting death happened on the reserve, but added police are still investigating whether the men were hunting legally.  He wouldn’t reveal what kind of gun killed Kosid because the information is part of the investigation.  Marrone said her fiancé regularly used a traditional bow to hunt deer on the Six Nations property with permission from the owner.  An emotional Marrone said she is still struggling to understand how the “senseless tragedy” happened.  “I hope everyone learns from this … line up your shot, see what you’re shooting at,” said Marrone, who has an eight-month-old son with Kosid and was planning their wedding for next year. “One careless shot and my husband is taken away from me.”  [email protected]  Apparently the shooter is facing charges of criminal negligence."

744025,BucktownAngler,2012-11-14 19:18:00,582,wow. thats terrible
744026,Rich Nelson,2012-11-14 19:19:00,332,"Very sad, and 100% avoidable. He was shot in the back while standing out in the open. ( shot from the rd at 375 meters away...)An Oshwegan man has been charged with criminal negligence causing death.  Doesnt sound like an accident to me.  And it definately wasnt a shotgun from that distance... When is the government gonna realize that some things need to change?  Tax paying/law abiding citizens shouldnt have to suffer because of the ""rights and special privelidges of others""... Makes me sick!"
744031,grt1,2012-11-14 19:31:00,638,"the brantford expositor is reporting the shooter to be a former nhl star, a well known enforcer from the boston bruins, you hockey guys will know who that is."
744036,Rich Nelson,2012-11-14 19:44:00,332,Hope his slap on the wrist doesnt sting too much...
744037,kemper,2012-11-14 19:45:00,2232,"Criminal negligence causing death? Sorry, sounds like Murder II to me.  Anyone who is willing to pull the trigger because they ""think"" they saw/heard a deer is a liability to society.   This should remind anyone who fishes in areas where hunters may be present (many of us river anglers) that we need to wear bright colours, preferably orange. You never know when the next idiot might mistake you for a deer."
744038,jedimaster,2012-11-14 19:45:00,3472,"Must be Stan Jonathon?? So weird. 375 meters for rifled 12 gauge is not out of the question. I think it would be roughly 10 feet of bullet drop for a 3"" remington accutip at 400 yards.... at least according to my chart. A rifle shot is much more likely."
744048,capt bruce,2012-11-14 20:01:00,820," It was Stan ... Do not want to stir up stuff , but the dude has problems well documented over the years , now some poor guy is dead !!!"
744050,jedimaster,2012-11-14 20:02:00,3472,Yah I seem to recall some stuff in the news some time ago with him.
744052,woodenboater,2012-11-14 20:08:00,2277,"This was on CHCH the other night, very tragic and didn't sound like an 'accident' from what I gather. They showed the field he was in and it's wide open and would be no mistaking him, imo, for anything that would be in season. Negligence ? I'd like to hear that rationale...  Hope they can figure out the why and deal with it one way or another. Two children are now fatherless."
744059,capt bruce,2012-11-14 20:19:00,820,"  At the risk of getting in trouble on this site I will only say , AND i HAVE NO PROof ' GUNS AND ALCOHOL DO NOT MIX "" BE CAREFULL OUT THERE GUYS YOU DO NOT KNOW WHO IS HUNTING BESIDE YOU , ALLWAYS WEAR BRIGHT ORANGE AND HOPE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE IN THE FOREST WITH YOU KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING .. when your dead your dead ... You can say sorry but dude is dead..and his family iswithout him .. sad sad sad ..."
744060,davey buoy,2012-11-14 20:19:00,5505,"Shooting into the trees?,doesn't make any sense why. Terrible, preventable accident. We hear about it far to often."
744128,bigugli,2012-11-14 23:13:00,6138,"This is a major reason why I gave up hunting 25 years back. ""Hunters"" shooting at anything that moves."
744146,dave524,2012-11-14 23:52:00,4508,That is sad. I just checked and it is still the same regs as when I bow and shotgun/muzzleloader hunted deer in the controlled areas. The Archery season closes during the shotgun/muzzleloader hunt and reopens when it is over. Something else is amiss here if they were both out at the same time.
744147,Rich Nelson,2012-11-14 23:58:00,332, Do those regs pertain to Six Nations?
744164,tb4me,2012-11-15 00:41:00,3295,Shotgun season ended sat night Bow opened again sun at dawn..I seriously doubt it was a shotgun at that range . Not to sure about Native status and hunting regs..I would imagine they can hunt any time. However I don't suspect they can hunt from roads with high powered rifles in densely populated areas.. Perhaps it was an accident but he broke many laws in doing so..Sure sucks for the family of the young man Killed.
744180,NAW,2012-11-15 01:15:00,4022,"I'm gunna do some research on this incident.  Regardless of who messed up, it's a sad story"
744199,Rich Nelson,2012-11-15 03:02:00,332,Problem is that you will get 5 different stories from 5 different media outlets... Gonna have to wait a few years to see how it plays out in court.
744201,i2cool2fool,2012-11-15 03:04:00,349,Wow. Very very sad indeed.
744224,K_F,2012-11-15 12:26:00,107," Actually the controlled shotgun season runs for a full week. 87E Nov. 5 to Nov. 11 343 SG, ML only Dec. 3 to Dec. 9 344 SG, ML only  Bow season doesnt open til the monday morning  80, 85A, 85B, 85C, 87B, 87C, 87D, 87E, 89A,89B, 90A, 90B, 93A, 93B Oct. 1 to Nov. 4 Nov. 12 to Dec. 2 Dec. 10 to Dec. 31  therefore in WMU's where there is no sunday gun hunting (like 87E where i hunt) there would be NO Hunting at all on sunday november 11th, gun or bow.  sad tradgedy none the less. Im not sure I feel safe all the time where there are regulations.....let alone where there arent"
744243,SirCranksalot,2012-11-15 14:49:00,3291,From media reports the guy has now been charged with homicide.
744251,Jds63,2012-11-15 15:24:00,1365,"here is a link to another article, very sad ...  http://www.thespec.com/news/local/article/836695--ex-nhler-stan-jonathan-charged-in-hunting-death"
744278,G.mech,2012-11-15 16:46:00,830,"  I believe he was charged with 'Criminal Negligence"" not homicide....kind of a moot point but somewhat important in some ways I guess..."
744549,pics,2012-11-16 13:53:00,1268,Sounds as if he was using a 270 Weatherby....probably saw something through the scope and fired from the comfort of his truck. Not something that would be frowned on at six nations....
