235447,tonka-toy,2008-08-02 01:50:00,139," Out here in East Side Scarborough, we eat em raw!!"
235449,Jonaton,2008-08-02 01:55:00,72,"Wow, those things would eat my PB muskie, huge fish."

235485,outllaw,2008-08-02 11:29:00,1232,and people laugh when we installed a harpoon on the boat.
234493,tonka-toy,2008-07-30 20:58:00,139,"Anyone seen the pics of thee big girls floating around some of the muskie sites the past week.Would post pics,but just recently taught to turn on a ""puter"" by my 6 year old son."
234571,BillM,2008-07-31 00:14:00,17367,"I saw a monster pulled out of the Bay on another musky specific board    I've only got one so far this season, but I am hoping for a few more.   Welcome aboard!"
234588,tonka-toy,2008-07-31 00:51:00,139,"Thanks bill,the three were reportedly 55"".56.5"" and 58.5"" and caught in Mille lacs,Vermillion and ""somewhere in Canada""All the fish looked huge,really wish I could put the shots up.By the way weve been doing pretty well this year(numbers not size)Cant wait for saturday."
234591,Raf,2008-07-31 00:56:00,3495,MN has quickly emerged as a poster child for their musky conservation efforts.  Kudos to them.  Are you listening Wisconsin?
234592,BillM,2008-07-31 00:56:00,17367,"I've been skunked this year while actually out for muskie..   Tried the French River for the opener, 3 days 14hrs a peice, not even a follow  Got back out about 3 weeks after that trip to Balsam trying to get the skunk off my back, but no luck either...  Finally 2 weeks ago while out on the Pool fishing for bass, this thing clobbers my zara spook  I am really thinking about giving the guys at Georgian Bay Musky Charters a call and booking a charter, I'd love to get a chance to hook into, or atleast see a monster.  (sorry for the crap pic, but I am still excited about it, lol)     If you want to email me the pics, I could host them for you in my Photobucket account!  Just shoot me off a PM..."
234596,Raf,2008-07-31 01:03:00,3495," Graham knows the water well.  If that's the route you wish to take, he's a good choice.  It is Gbay and there are no guarantees other than you will learn something.  He might even show you the shoal where the WR was caught."
234598,BillM,2008-07-31 01:07:00,17367,"Raf, that is what I am really after....  Catching a fish would be just a bonus.   Mouth shut, ears open"
234599,tonka-toy,2008-07-31 01:10:00,139,"Whoa,Whoa don't go confusing me with all that fancy computer lingo and such,it took me way too long to figure out a simple post.I reached out to a friend and I am hopeing he can(link,upload,dowload,cut,paste or attach?)to this post soon."

234709,tonka-toy,2008-07-31 04:33:00,139,"Leechman ,those are not my fish,I wish...I just saw them on other boards and thought i'd share."
234761,Greencoachdog,2008-07-31 11:51:00,8163,If they were caught by trolling... they don't count!
