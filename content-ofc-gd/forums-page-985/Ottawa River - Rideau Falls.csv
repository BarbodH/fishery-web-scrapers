We arrived at around 7:15pm and didn't take long, as soon as my jig hit bottom got a hit and hooked a small eye right off the bat  Quick pic and released.    The fish finder at this point was beeping non stop and all I could think of was FRENZY  It was Paul's turn to hook one.....    And another.....    The eyes, even tho were on the small size, were very aggressive and hitting our jigs real hard.... We lost a few decent ones at boat side   dunno what happened.... guess didn't set the hook hard enough.....  oh well, it happens.  Then Paul get's a hit and set's the hook good this time..... I grab the net..... what do you know.... it's a drum    As soon as he get's his jig on bottom...... BANG get's a hit and another drum    Managed to land a ton of these....    All of sudden....it's my turn to get a hit and land this cat.....    and this one to call it a day....    All in all was a good night to be out on the river and lots of fun.... All fish were released. Got back home at around 10:00pm Sure looking forward to the next outing. Leechman"
235473,pokerdemon4,2008-08-02 04:59:00,135,Great report leechman.  Looks like a great day on the water.  Do you eat the catfish?  They look nice and clean.  Thanks for posting.
235480,lunkerbasshunter,2008-08-02 11:15:00,2585,good report!  thanks for sharing  cheers!
235499,Leecher,2008-08-02 12:54:00,7832," Thanks pokerdemon4.....they are indeed clean but don't eat them.  I prefer the lake cats for eating and compared to the river ones, are smaller in size.  It's a lot a fun to catch, picture and release them    I have yet to hook a big one.....some are pushing the 10lbs+ in size.  Leechman"
