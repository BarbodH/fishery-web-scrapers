235244,Cast Adventures,2008-08-01 16:00:00,74,"Niagara Region Bass /Walleye Report     I can’t believe were already into August! Hopefully you’ve all had a chance to get out to your favorite fishing hole this summer and enjoyed some time on the water. Lake Erie and the Niagara River have been producing great fish for anglers from all corners of the globe. The Smallmouth bass fishing has been outstanding this season!    Top baits for catching bass have been the drop shot with Strike Zone Slammers, tubes, Senko’s ,deep diving crank baits, Jerk baits, top water lures like the Pop “R” and spinner baits. Having ALL of these baits/lures rigged and ready will allow you to cover different depths and conditions effectively.     Experiment with different colors and location/depths each trip for best results. Two patterns have been holding up for us. Fishing for bass in shallow water: 5 to 15 feet (sight fishing) and deeper rock flats/ humps: 25 to 45 feet.  Change baits even if you’re catching fish. Example: you get on a spinner bait bite in 12 feet of water, try ripping jerk bait or working a crank bait though the same water. At times you might trigger some bigger fish that are using the same area. Or slow right down and use the Slammers or tube before leaving to look for new/more fish. We have seen this many times over the summer. By taking the time to change presentation and colors, it may result in more/bigger fish to the net from each location you try.      Keeping an open mind and trying both shallow and deep each day on the water will help you find and stay on top of active fish. Weather/waves also will determine where you can fish.     A word of caution: always check the weather before you leave the house! We’ve been experiencing lots of heavy rain and short intense lighting storms this season. Better to be safe then sorry! It can really blow up fast on the open water, best to stay close to the boat ramp or even stay home if the weather is going to be nasty.      The Walleye fishing in the river is starting to slow down. The bigger fish seem to be moving out into the lake. Were still getting smaller walleye 2 to 6lbs at 1st and last light on worm harnesses and jigging with grubs and buck tails. The best depths have been 17 to 25 FOW. Harnesses colors: gold blade with pink or orange beads. Silver blades with green and orange beads. When faced with off colored water. Orange blade with orange beads seems to work best for us.      Here are a few more pics of those other fish you get while fishing the niagara region: Man these guys pull hard!!!    The best fishing of the summer is yet to come! Get out when you can and enjoy your time off on the water!!!  See you on the river,  Cast Adventures"
