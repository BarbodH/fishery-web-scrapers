Every recipe I have tried doesn't come close to the pie I tasted at my husband's french canadian relatives over 10 years ago.  They aren't around so I can't ask them.  I'll try anything you suggest, I think it is full cream but I'm really not sure.  I don't know how they get the stiff consistency with the creamy taste.  Thanks in advance.  Pam"
234378,Bly,2008-07-30 15:41:00,1556,"Morning Pamela  Not sure what you have tried but maybe this one will work....  1/2 cup warm whole milk 4 Tbls cornstarch  2 cups whole milk 1/3 cups sugar 1/4 tsp salt 2 egg yolks (beaten)  1 1/4 tsp vanilla 1 Tbls butter   Combine the 1/2 cup of milk and cornstarch first.   Combine the remaining milk, sugar, salt and eggs then add the milk and cornstarch mixture.  Over medium heat, stir CONSTANTLY.  Bring to a boil, continue to boil for a full 2 minutes...keep stirring.  Just before removing it from the heat, stir in the butter and vanilla.   Allow 10 minutes of cooling time (I like to cover this with wax paper to prevent a skin from forming) , whip and pour into baked pie shell.  Top with meringue, whip cream, whatever you like  It has been my experience with this recipe that to achieve a creamy yet firm consistency, it should be allowed ample time to set.  I prepare it the day before I intend to serve it.   Hope you find one that works!!"

235332,dannyboy,2008-08-01 19:40:00,367,"The recipe I use is the same as Bly's except I use 2 Tbls of flour and 2 Tbls of cornstarch instead of 4 Tbls of cornstarch, I find it makes it smoother. The whole milk adds a richness to the recipe.  Dan"
