(late) Cedar is a teffific lake with several older lodges catering to mostly american cliental.. heck nothing wrong w/ americans right? I have to mention the musky fishing as I've found it to be world class. In a single evening (last yr) my son boated 3 in 2 hrs with the largest being 49"". That photo will hang in our home forever. Good walleye fishing and great shore lunch spots. One in particular is located right @ the mouth of the Perrault/Ceadr transition on a beautiful point.(e) Smallmouth are a bailout fish if the others are stingy, find the rocky shoreline etc. I've never fished it for northerns. I'll never forget sticking a nice walleye, playing it, then seeing the dark shadow which when a little shallower became the largest musky I've ever seen. Must of taken 10 min to switch over to our heaver eqpt.                      good luck"
