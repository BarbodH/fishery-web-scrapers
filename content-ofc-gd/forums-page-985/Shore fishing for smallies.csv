235841,Cudz,2008-08-04 01:35:00,2652,"Due to the fact that my boat motor has been out of commission for the better part of the summer I have been trying my hand at various random spots on lake simcoe and nearby lakes.  I have been fishing from shore, waist deep in water, and from docks.  My biggest fish from shore this year was 2.5 pounds but i could not get a pic because I had waded out 30 yards and by the time I got back in to get the camera and take the pic the fish would have suffered. Here are some pics of the other fish I have caught.  One is a 2 pounder and the rest range from 1 - 1.75 pounds (ish). Most of my fish have been caught drop shotting Gulp leech or gulp fry.  I have also caugth several on 6"" senko and one on a topwater popper. Sometimes it can be a bit frustrating but any bad day fishing is better than a good day at work.    "
235844,jediangler,2008-08-04 01:39:00,1923,Nice smallies Cudz. Nice to see someone who owns a boat fishing from shore. I have buddies that won't even fish in someone elses boat if theirs is in the shop.

235862,Cudz,2008-08-04 02:14:00,2652,That is nice of you to ask.  My boat is fixed and it comes back next week.  One of the big reasons I fish from shore is because I have 3 kids.  I take them with me and they play in the park while I fish lol.  Time is my problem.  I don't have much free time.  Maybe later in the summer we could hook up and fish Simcoe or little lake.
