235552,Musky or Specks,2008-08-02 21:04:00,2710,Ill abide by the poll decision and will report back on Monday
235557,misfish,2008-08-02 21:17:00,29133,"Sparrow,and stop by and pick me up   Awe not.LOL"
235558,ccmtcanada,2008-08-02 21:19:00,7971,"Back lake for sure!  Leave the long weekend crowds behind.  Fish in tranquility.  When you have to work that hard to get to the location, then it's much more satisfying to catch them."
235559,JohnF,2008-08-02 21:28:00,3494,"Bass! Reservoir! Canoe! I won't be like Misfish and whine about getting picked up cuz I know that 3 in a canoe sux.  I'm heading out to a spot I know where I can wade, hopefully alone, and commune with the fishies. Hopefully I can get out early enough to beat the madding throng. Generally speaking the first guy to the spot gets the spot around here. I'm gonna be first. Spent all day doing chores here at home so I can escape tomorrow at first lite.  Good luck and good fishing wherever the vote takes you.  JF"
235560,Wild,2008-08-02 21:31:00,704,Reservoir X cause inquiring minds want to know...
235561,misfish,2008-08-02 21:35:00,29133," Whine??????????????? Fine,I,ll fish from the shore Sunday.I,ll show you whine.LOL   You cant belate,first lite is way to late.Leave now.HAHAHA"
235572,Musky or Specks,2008-08-02 22:31:00,2710,Looking like Im going to get a workout first thing in the morning tommorow.
235575,Greencoachdog,2008-08-02 22:35:00,8163,What?... no selection for Atlantic Salmon and Gobies in the Armpit of Ontario?
235579,grt1,2008-08-02 22:46:00,638,"I voted to send you crappie fishing ,since we don't have them in Red Lake and I thought someone should enjoy catching them."
235592,BillM,2008-08-02 23:39:00,17367,Portage for ski's?  Sounds like it could be interesting!!!
235600,Leecher,2008-08-03 00:00:00,7832, I second that  Leechman
235611,JohnF,2008-08-03 00:29:00,3494,I think that all the guys who voted for the portage should show up to carry the canoe fer ya.  JF
235677,jediangler,2008-08-03 03:24:00,1923,"If that's all it takes to find the secret spot, I'll carry the canoe ."
235680,Musky or Specks,2008-08-03 03:56:00,2710,"Its not all that big of a secret. MNR publishes a musky atlas listing every body of water that has musky in it in Ontario. Check it out, do some research."
235681,carp-starter,2008-08-03 04:23:00,253,Amazing - can't you guys decide on your own? Do you guys need a poll? And this is only for one day?  Just ask your Mother.  I hate to see you guys decide on something a bit more important than as to where to go fishing.  carp-starter  PS: screw the 3 places in the poll. Go to a 4th place.
235682,Musky or Specks,2008-08-03 04:39:00,2710,"No I cant, I've been fishing for over 30 years and I know so many spots. These are the three that I whittled it down to. Every time I decide on one of them I come up with an arguement as to why I should do another. Yes its only for one day but my day trips can be more complex than most other people. So I thought a poll would be a fun way to make a decision. As for a fourth spot Ive already taken it down to three from a couple of hundred spots. If I was deciding on something important do you honestly think I would leave it up to an internet poll? Get real and if you have nothing positive to say stifle."
235698,lunkerbasshunter,2008-08-03 12:34:00,2585,"  Someone sounds like they are having a bad day. man that was a little harsh.  It is a fun post, if you didn't like his topic then maybe it would be best not to comment at all on it so you don't ruin it for the rest of the people here that are enjoying it.    i personally loved the idea of him letting us pic where to fish.  it was fun to see that most people would take the back lake place considering if you ever go to a back lake nobody is ever there lol  Hope you have a great day on whatever lake you fish on!  Cheers!"
235759,BillM,2008-08-03 20:17:00,17367,"I would love some backwoods musky action!  Musky or Specs, if you need a young buck to carry a canoe anytime, just let me know  :)  Good luck!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I think I am going to go hit the local trout stream tonight!"
235797,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-08-03 23:37:00,0,Hands down I'd go with the back lake.
235814,Rich,2008-08-04 00:17:00,3927,"I see only one with the choice of ""musky"" so it's a no-brainer!"
