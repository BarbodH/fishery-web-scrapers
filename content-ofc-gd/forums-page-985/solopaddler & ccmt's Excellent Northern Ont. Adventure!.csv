I may be heading up to those neck of the woods myself this coming friday.  I just hope the weather fairs a little better.  Thanx for shareing guys that was great.  Nauti.
234590,solopaddler,2008-07-31 00:54:00,8605,  Hey Nauti I was thinking of you when we drove through V-Town. Check your pm's
234593,nautifish,2008-07-31 00:57:00,1416,Nothing in my pms....solo....  I love it up there i really do it is just beautiful and like a whole different world.  Which is why i am hoping to head back up that way this long weekend.

234594,nautifish,2008-07-31 01:03:00,1416,"  Got it,  Check your PM."

235309,lunkerbasshunter,2008-08-01 18:18:00,2585,wow that was a great report!  what a fun time that must have been!  Cheers!
235541,wallyboss,2008-08-02 19:40:00,1095,"Pretty well had the same results in the same area.  It seems like the bigger eyes were biting well on the rivers in the SRF area But all we caught in the small lake were dinks like yours, But they are the best eating. I was parked in front of the same Timmies at 3:00am this morning."
235609,solopaddler,2008-08-03 00:24:00,8605," Interesting, thanks for the comment. After the experience north/east of Cochrane the lesson learned was you'll never drive to a lake no matter how far north and expect to destroy fish.  You've got to put at least one portage between you and the hordes. Something I knew already but I thought it was worth the chance..  The experience was a blast though  ."
235732,wallyboss,2008-08-03 17:05:00,1095,You'll remember that trip for a while!!! weren't those black flies just a bit on the annoying side.  I have never seen them that bad up there and I lived there for 20 years.
235821,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-08-04 01:00:00,0,Excellent Report!Sounds like it had some ups and downs but over all was a successful trip. And boy do you like to eat good!!!The pictures made me very hungry! Good to hear your dad had a great time also. Thanks for sharing.
233982,Whopper,2008-07-29 10:47:00,2174,"Excellent report Mike! You guys eat better off a camp grill then I do at home An adventure to remember for Cliff, thanks for sharing. Even with the weather it looked like a good time to me"

234092,solopaddler,2008-07-29 17:16:00,8605," Hey man I was wondering where you went to, you fell off the face of the earth. Stay in touch and let's try and get out!"
234109,douG,2008-07-29 19:03:00,2693,"Faboolas, faboolas.  Great report, Mike and Cliff."

234124,dannyboy,2008-07-29 19:42:00,367,"Great report, thanks. Dan"
234158,bigbuck,2008-07-29 21:24:00,2449,You guys had a blast!! That's what I call a fishing trip!!! Gotta get up that way one day.
234173,johnnyb,2008-07-29 22:29:00,3413,"Extremely well done, guys!  That is the kind of trip that keeps me awake at night....heading north and hitting the back lakes...wow! I especially love the pic of solopaddler's dad with his big walleye and the stub of his stogey in his mouth"
234197,fishindevil,2008-07-29 23:28:00,6254,"Great fishing trip/report guys !!!!.  ..nice pics too,some real nice looking fish as well !!...cheers"
234222,jediangler,2008-07-30 00:33:00,1923,That was a beauty report. Well done. You gotta love the Sportspal for those wilderness trips. How do you like the x-trail? It's on my short list for next vehicle.
234237,solopaddler,2008-07-30 00:52:00,8605," I'm loving the X-Trail! I drove a CRV for 6 years prior to this one and there's no comparison IMO. Better on gas even with a slightly peppier engine. Excellent 4wd system and much more ""offroad-worthy"" than any other small SUV in it's class. Smoother and quieter on the hwy than my CRV was as well. Maybe it doesn't have quite the same resale value as Honda, but still pretty darn good I'm sure and head and shoulders above any domestic vehicle in it's class.  (can you tell I'm happy with it?  )"
234243,MrMike,2008-07-30 00:56:00,153,great report neat pics
233914,tibbs,2008-07-29 02:23:00,650,WOW!  Fantastic report!  Looks Beautiful up there!
233916,PatrickGG,2008-07-29 02:27:00,562,Awesome report and Pics looks like a good time indeed.
233917,danc,2008-07-29 02:30:00,4677,"I've been waiting for this report Mike. Despite the so so fishing, it looks like you guys had a blast. If I was either one of you guys, I'd be happy to spend the time with the other. I see another adventure on the horizon for you two. No doubt the fishing will be better next time."
233920,Leecher,2008-07-29 02:43:00,7832,Great job Mike.....your Dad sure looked very happy about the biggest walley on the pic  That was a good read and thanks for sharing Leechman
233921,MCTFisher9120,2008-07-29 02:45:00,3761,Looks like a fun trip. Thanks for the read!  Mike
233925,Wild,2008-07-29 02:53:00,704,And what a perfect way to end my day. Thanks
233927,Mike the Pike,2008-07-29 02:56:00,3421,Now I really enjoyed that boyz always a pleasure to fish with Cliff one day I hope to fish with you.  Thanks for taking the time to post that for a guy who earns his living from the weather you sure can write.  Not sure I could look at Cliff with a bug net on his face all day kind of looks like Little Red Riding Hood  Well all I need is a Sportspal canoe.I have the same 2hp need to go far North sometime in the near future when my grows a little bigger and stronger.  Excellent now I can't wait to see the videos
233928,Terry,2008-07-29 03:04:00,14456,looks like a great trip
233930,Joey,2008-07-29 03:06:00,9122,Now that's what I call a report.  Way to go you guys  What an excellent adventure  Joey
233934,ccmtcanada,2008-07-29 03:13:00,7971,"All I can say is WOW!  I had an awesome time....even though it rained, hailed and the fishing was slow.  For me it really was an adventure...as I'd never been on a trip like that before.  I learned a TON from you....from reading a lake (What structure to look for both on the shore and under water), to jigging, and the use of worm harnesses.  It's all stuff I'll take with me whenever I'm fishing.  We should try to do it again....I'm willing to be more adventurous....maybe even a moderate portage....LOL.  Thanks a lot Mike...I'm telling everyone who will listen about the trip.  Anyhow...here's a short video of the place we took cover in...as well as a little bit of the storm that we encountered.....  <embed width=""320"" height=""240"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" wmode=""transparent"" src=""http://i120.photobucket.com/player.swf?file=http://vid120.photobucket.com/albums/o185/ccmtcanada/solopaddlerstorm.flv"">"
233936,ccmtcanada,2008-07-29 03:16:00,7971, Ahem...you're one to throw stones with what ppl wear fishing....LOL.  Do I need to dig up some pics of you???  I only wore it on shore and as we were leaving where we launched...and in the evenings when we were not in the screenhouse.  He snapped that pic about a 100 feet from shore....LOL.  I was just impatient and started to cast right away....I caught a pike on my 3rd cast....
233938,Dondorfish,2008-07-29 03:28:00,1000,Nicely done guys! - but even thou the fishing was slow - I'd bet we would see some monster fish caught if a certain lady angler had been there with you guys.  LOL   Don
233939,ccmtcanada,2008-07-29 03:29:00,7971,"I didn't really get much video of the actual fishing, but here's a few more quick videos....  This is Solopaddler catching his favourite species....you can see the excitement on his face and hear it in his voice!!!  <embed width=""320"" height=""240"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" wmode=""transparent"" src=""http://i120.photobucket.com/player.swf?file=http://vid120.photobucket.com/albums/o185/ccmtcanada/solopaddlerpike.flv"">  This really doesn't do it justice....but here's a little of the scenery.  It's amazing to me...because I'm used to fishing lakes with endless cottages lining the shore and seeing other fishing boats, water skiers and jetskis all over the place.  <embed width=""320"" height=""240"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" wmode=""transparent"" src=""http://i120.photobucket.com/player.swf?file=http://vid120.photobucket.com/albums/o185/ccmtcanada/soloscenery.flv"">"
233941,solopaddler,2008-07-29 03:34:00,8605," That's a great little video clip Cliff, love it! (We'll do it it again for sure bud)  Thanks everyone else for the comments!"
233942,Musky or Specks,2008-07-29 03:35:00,2710,Great report guys. Ive seen worse hunt camps beleive you me.
233946,solopaddler,2008-07-29 03:52:00,8605," Thanks bud.  I've seen worse hunt camps though too, been in 'em in fact. What the pic's or video don't convey though is the smell. It was like a skunk that just crawled out of another skunks butt  . Beyond the stench and filth every single surface in that place had some kind of unknown disgusting sticky substance on it.  It was baaaaad!"
233947,Moosebunk,2008-07-29 03:54:00,3970,"Glad you could squeak this report in before I leave Mike.  Too bad about destination 1.  I can only imagine the big clearing at that spot before the launch being full of tents and summer campers, must have been packed.  Everyone has 21 days but I'm sure the place gets it's fair share of squatters and no one gets pushed to move along.  Looks like a few folks from New Post erected a real tent too.  September there were no bugs and no people there.  I swear I recognize where you were in pics 1,3,4 and 5.  The sidetrips I found often start out OK, but then end up 4-wheeler narrow.  Did one 18-point turn with the Silverado to get out of one jam, and had to make about 2 dozen attempts to angle cross a bride not wide enough for a truck.  Bill McCord.  That was the name of the MNR guy whom I spoke with and faxed me up the stocking lists.  Talk about A1 CO's for the Cochrane district.  Too bad the fishing wasn't better, but truth is... I think it'll only make Cliff want to get back there that much more.  Good show fellas.  I'll have to view the vids at home later."
233950,Musky or Specks,2008-07-29 04:13:00,2710,We needed the video in Smell-orama. With little scratch and snifff cards that you smell on cue. Does anyone remember that gimic?
233951,scuro,2008-07-29 04:20:00,386,Really nice smallies...and so it goes sometimes. Nice report...thanks for sharing...those stunted trees haunt me everytime I look.
233953,sharper,2008-07-29 04:26:00,279,Looks like a great time! cool custom plate as well
233966,Roy,2008-07-29 08:42:00,13728,You're right guys. That WAS an excellent adventure. Thank you for  taking the time to post that. A really well documented account of a coupla buds having a good time and making the best on inclement weather and really working at finding the fish.
233967,Greencoachdog,2008-07-29 08:56:00,8163,An Epic reprt for sure!!!  I think Cliff looks good in that bug suit... hides some of the damn ugly!!!
233969,Rich Clemens,2008-07-29 09:48:00,3131,Sounds like that trip was a world of fun.  Great reports guys.
233976,MrMike,2008-07-29 10:17:00,153,great report neat pics
