235544,jediangler,2008-08-02 19:47:00,1923,Congrats. It must have been a hoot catching a musky on a jitterbug.
235545,johnl,2008-08-02 19:50:00,197,Ya i casted it for two hours as my friends argued about how it wasnt a good spot and how the trip was going to be a waste of time .This shut them up
235547,mikeh,2008-08-02 20:41:00,824,congrats. did you measure it?
235615,Leecher,2008-08-03 00:34:00,7832,That must of been a thrill just to see your jitterbug get hit by this guy  Did you release it after unhooking the lure??  Leechman
