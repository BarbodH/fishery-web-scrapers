Ill be back with a report later tonight, just know that the pin has been dusted off and crazy things are soon to happen.   EDIT REPORT TIME   Headed down to the local haunt, and found small mouth bass! Float worms just like I would for steel.  What a BLAST on the pin!  Big fish was almost 19""  what a cool way to spend an hour...here are the pics and a cool one from last night at scugog         "

235379,tibbs,2008-08-01 21:48:00,650,Nice Job!  That's a big smallie!  How was the fight compared to a steelhead?
235380,kemper,2008-08-01 21:52:00,2232,"With the big equiptment it was nothing compared to the power of a steelie, but it was really cool because it was so much easier to control the acrobatics with the extra power and movement in the big stick. Took quite a while to land the big one, much longer than it would with a regular rod and reel"
235385,tibbs,2008-08-01 21:59:00,650, Cool!
235423,Canuck2fan,2008-08-01 23:49:00,1444," I can't believe somebody finally listened when I posted a while back in another thread about floating for bass....  http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/index.p...22216&st=20  We have been doing it with spinning equipment rigged ""exactly"" the same as for trout with worms  or live leeches for a couple of years in rivers and the results are fantastic."
235435,ccmtcanada,2008-08-02 00:24:00,7971,"Great job Kemper.  That spot you were at has produced smallies for Bly and I this year as well.  Like Canuck said, live leeches worked very well for us."
