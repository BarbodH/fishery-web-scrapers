235621,Wild,2008-08-03 00:54:00,704,Looks like a real fun day! Is that the Watson's mill?
235623,JohnF,2008-08-03 00:59:00,3494,"Crap. They catch bigger fish than I do.  I'm going out to buy one of those Snoopy rods, or is it Barby?  JF"
235628,Tinman,2008-08-03 01:09:00,376,  Thats the Watson's mill! Close to home! And it was a tigger rod!!! It actually has a drag setting! lol
235630,JohnF,2008-08-03 01:23:00,3494, Drag is good. I can learn to use that.  JF
235634,Wild,2008-08-03 01:29:00,704,And it even comes with 50 lb test John for those really big ones!
235636,Tinman,2008-08-03 01:31:00,376,"My daughter had a dora the exploere rod and it had no drag, she caught a sunfish one day and a pike grabbed it pulled out a whack of line. i had to bring it in hand over fist! lol"
235637,JohnF,2008-08-03 01:32:00,3494, Good. I like to horse 'em.  JF
235639,JohnF,2008-08-03 01:33:00,3494, Obviously she doesn't use braid.  JF
235641,Tinman,2008-08-03 01:34:00,376,"nope, no braid lol"
235644,JohnF,2008-08-03 01:37:00,3494," So, just supposin' I got one of these rods, do ya think it would handle 35# Superbraid? It would be nice if the little holey thingy where the line falls out on the front had a ceramic liner.  JF"
235647,Wild,2008-08-03 01:40:00,704,Yeah that's available on the paris hilton
235652,sturgman,2008-08-03 01:45:00,249,Its great to smiles on the kids faces...Awesome pics!!
235671,Tinman,2008-08-03 02:50:00,376,Hopefullt we will be out again on There Grampy's boat on monday to fish
235694,lunkerbasshunter,2008-08-03 12:18:00,2585,"this is one of my favorite reports all summer so far!  great pics, who doesnt love seeing kids faces when they catch fish!  cheers!"
235773,Rich,2008-08-03 22:01:00,3927, Hahahahahahahaha
235774,JohnF,2008-08-03 22:01:00,3494,"Gotta thank you and the kids for inspiring me to finally catch a decent SMB today. As much as I covet that really cool purple spincaster, I doubt that the slab I had on today would have let hisself be hauled in on that. braid or no. I may still get a Dora rod for my everyday fishing, but for manly fish I guess I'll stick with my $19.95 Dick's Sports Shakespeare trigger spincaster and 4 1/2' rod with no backbone combo. If that doesn't pan out, I may have to spend more. Whatcha think?  JF"
235784,Wild,2008-08-03 22:39:00,704,Nope I say spend the big bucks on a new Mickey Mouse Camera John haha
235788,JohnF,2008-08-03 22:50:00,3494, Does it need batteries?  JF
235791,Wild,2008-08-03 23:06:00,704,No batteries required and it doubles as a lunch pail 
235816,JohnF,2008-08-04 00:23:00,3494, Will it fit down the bib of my waders?  JF
