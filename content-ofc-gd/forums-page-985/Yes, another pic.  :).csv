Dunno if the rain lastnight turned the fish off, but sheesh we worked really hard for a couple of small dinks..  I got home around noon, had a nap, ate some dinner and decided to hit a local trout stream.  Water was gin clear..  Lure of the day was a BlueFox #0 silver spinner.  Picked up about 10 or so small bows, biggest about 10inches.  Had a pic all setup for the biggest fish, but she flopped loose and back in the drink she went, lol..  I did get a pic of this little beauty though.    Hopefully you guys had better luck today then me!"
