Gulp Alive Spray bottle indicates what flavors such as crawfish, nightcrawler & Garlic it is but Gulp Alive leeches/minnow does not. Which flavor is it?  I wonder if both juices are the same then I can use them for recharging  Any thoughts?  "

234923,Guest Fishing For Life,2008-07-31 19:48:00,0,Uhm ...  nobody wants to put down their two cents?
235095,Guest Fishing For Life,2008-08-01 03:09:00,0,Are you guys serious? no one wants to help me out?
235097,e-z-out,2008-08-01 03:24:00,1052,i have tried the spray and it seems to work but you have to keep adding spray every time you pull it out of the water. I would go with the Gulp Alive minnows in the bucket just dip and your ready to go. They last longer for me this way
235102,bassmaster4,2008-08-01 03:46:00,801,the gulp alive minnows already come with the juice so there is no point in buying the extra spray while you can just dip it back in the bucket and recharge it
235345,Rich,2008-08-01 19:59:00,3927,I'm sure it would have the same effect as the juice in the bucket.
235354,Terry,2008-08-01 20:19:00,14456,like most here(I think) I read your post but don't have an answer
235361,GBW,2008-08-01 20:37:00,8460,"I would say the bucket is better only because the bait is in there longer to recharge.  with that said (and that most people are not using the bucket that it comes in due to leaking) I would guess that if you dumped the spay in to your own bucket and stored the bait in it that it would work just as well.  so, now what costs more?  a bucket with bait or spay + bait?  looks like Canuck2fan has a new test to try..."
235422,uglyfish,2008-08-01 23:46:00,981,"lol, its all the same juice. they add a new name to the bottle so you'll buy it. they want u to buy all the crap they make. so they get money. ever notice how it says on the buckey not to put any other lure or bait into the juice?? why u ask..?? so you'll go spend the 10 bucks on the spray instead."
235629,Clampet,2008-08-03 01:19:00,1947,There is a considerable loss of product caused by 'overspray'. It's hard to manage to spray just the lure surface without getting some on the nearby scenery as well.
235668,Guest Fishing For Life,2008-08-03 02:36:00,0,"Since I dont make 100k a year ... I actually poured some juice from the minnow bucket to another liquid-tight container to recharnge my baits to prevent contamination, haha  BTW, who can tell me all so-called ""favors"" are the same?"
235801,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-08-03 23:50:00,0,Gulp juice all the way.
