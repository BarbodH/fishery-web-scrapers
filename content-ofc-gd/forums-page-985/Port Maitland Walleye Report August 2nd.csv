235635,Sandbag,2008-08-03 01:31:00,533,Great report Steve...  Man you guys are on to them off Maitland this year  Cheers  Craig
235699,lunkerbasshunter,2008-08-03 12:44:00,2585,"good report, there sure are some nice walleye you are pulling out this year  cheers!"
235710,Almontefisher,2008-08-03 13:44:00,18,Very nice day for sure...Tried for walleye yesterday in a little lake around my home and not a thing...Did anyone else notice on the stringer line that one was not a walleye...Must have been a little perch snack craving.
235713,Wild,2008-08-03 14:26:00,704,Looks like a great trip however the guy smoking in the proximity of the young fisherman should know better
235753,Jonaton,2008-08-03 18:44:00,72,"While I agree smoking around kids is bad they are outside on a moving boat, try walking in any city and breathing in the car fumes among other pollutants, tell me which is worse for the young boy."
235777,Wild,2008-08-03 22:21:00,704,Sorry but I see no justification at any level. But I am glad to see the young fishermanâ€™s pride with his catch.
235779,pokerdemon4,2008-08-03 22:27:00,135,I wish I had those waldos in my frying pan right now.  Great job guys.  Great report.
235822,Jonaton,2008-08-04 01:02:00,72,"Well I hope you don't drive or own a boat, you are doing far more damage to his lungs and the environment than smoking in an open space."
235828,bucktail,2008-08-04 01:24:00,1857,Wild   your serious??????
