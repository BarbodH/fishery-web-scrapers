It was a beautiful morning and the lake was almost like glass. Started off at 80fow and made my way out to 250fow. I didnt even have the rods all down and bam! fish on.  A decent rainbow to start the day. The fishing was real good for the first 4 hours then died off a bit. We finished the day 10 for 14. 7 bows and 3 chinnys. Biggest going 11lbs. most fish came 40ft down. Dreamweaver and Fishlander spoons 50ft back at 2.7mph.  I had my friends out today that just took up fishing, they had a blast each catching 2-3 fish.  Getting them to run the net was a little hectic!!!                big fish of the day 11lbs   "
