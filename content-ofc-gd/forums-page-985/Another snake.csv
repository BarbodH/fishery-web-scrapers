234534,camillj,2008-07-30 22:40:00,1988,Water snake ... for sure ... very common and extremely aggressive .... not venomous but will shake you up as they wont back down from a chance to chase and bite you especially near waters edge ... you can normally distract them with a fishing rod and rapala
234548,danbo,2008-07-30 23:06:00,2646,"Sure would make a purdy hatband. Just skin it, scrape it down with the edge of a tablespoon, Staple-gun it to a board, rub Borax on it & let it dry."
234605,Dabluz,2008-07-31 01:16:00,701,Those water snakes can grow to 4 feet long.
234721,Carp,2008-07-31 06:10:00,1488,"Fished/camped in a remote area of eastern Georgian Bay years back. The place was infested with these water snakes. Got to the point where we were being chased away from the boats. Had to throw fish scraps to distract them. They picked ' em up from the bottom on the lake & swam away. Venemous or not, these snakes were way too agressive for my liking.  Paddled the boat through a shallow, narrow channel between islands. One large snake swam towards the boat, right under us & onto shore on the opposite side. I spotted the head coming out from under the boat & quickly looked to the other side, where I saw the tail still waiting to be pulled under. With the width of the boat as a guide, I estimated the length to be at least seven feet. Although, all the others we saw were around 2 to 4 feet long. Also one bold bass bear who decided to swim across a channel to our island camp because he liked the smell of our lunch. Middle of a hot, sunny summer day. These animals/reptiles had absolutely no fear. Probably never encountered humans before.  Once as young teens fishing off the dock in the Moon River Basin, we encountered one of these water snakes hiding under us. As we pulled out panfish, the snake would grab the fish and not let go until we yanked it up & down a few times over the water. This went on for half an hour before the snake finally got tired and swam away. We're lucky these things aren't poisonous. Probably the most agressive creatures I've encountered in Ontario, ....well, except for a few cougars cruising for a mate."
234729,Cudz,2008-07-31 08:43:00,2652, LOL at the cougar. Once I was cornered by somthing worse than a cougar.  It was a sabertooth.  Very similar to a cougar but actually was a cougar's mother.  She was probably 58-63 years old.   Those are scary.  It was at a wedding.
234830,jughead,2008-07-31 15:51:00,92,"It's a northern water snake. They have a brownish pattern on their back in a diamond shape when they are younger, as they mature if fades so the snake appears all black or dark grey.  They can be aggressive if they feel they are cornered but for the most part they cruise along the shoreline looking for frogs. We have a few at the cottage every year that roam our bay.  The only time we have had any problems was a couple of years ago when my daughter decided to make the snake go away by smacking it with a swimming noodle. As it turns out, Northern water Snakes don't much care for that type of behaviour. They will attack but usually only to defend themselves and as soon as they have an opportunioty to get away the will take it.  Went to take the cover off my boat last year and found one curled up inside which scared the bejeezus out of me for a minute or twenty.  No Black rat snakes at my place this year but did help a neighbour relocate one this spring that had set up under his cottage. About 7 feet long and quite thick. Into the pillow case for a short boat ride and happily released."
234901,BillsTheBassMan,2008-07-31 19:04:00,932,"We had a visit from this fellow when we rented a Cottage at Sparrow Lake:    The locals informed us that it was a rattle snake, and that if we were lucky enough to get bit, we'd have to travel to bracebridge.  At which point they said ""ahhhhh, he's just a little guy.""  I'm sure he was, as he was the furthest thing from aggressive.  Yours does not seem to be venemous.  I see snakes that look like that a lot up in the Wiarton area."
234906,danbo,2008-07-31 19:13:00,2646,Better teach your children the differences!
234993,kennyman,2008-07-31 22:59:00,737,"I just got back a few days from Charleston Lake Provincial Park where the black rat snake is there most famous resident. They have one they even show. According to the guides they are virtually harmless. One was following kids in the water at the beach. Basically came over, checked them out and was on his way. The kids followed etc., but there was no problem. Apperently the black rat snakes have a rattle as a defence mechanism to mimic the Massassuaga, but are a non venomous constrictor. There was one under the pop machine and all the kids would be checking it out everytime we went by. Didn't seem too dangerous to me and it was a good size. Actually my daughter said it was ""cute"". Mind you I wouldn't want to be  squirrel in this guys tree. Anyway here's an article from Ontario Parks.    Harmless - but becoming homeless  Canada's largest snake lives only in two distinct regions of Ontario - the Carolinian Forest region, running across the north shore of Lake Erie in southwestern Ontario, and the Frontenac Axis region in southeastern Ontario. The black rat snakes in these areas are at the periphery of the species' range, with those in the Frontenac Axis being at the very northern edge.  From their range in the eastern United States, they moved northward with the retreating glaciers. This means that for about 7,000 years they have made these areas of Ontario their home.  Historical records indicate that prior to European settlement, black rat snakes lived throughout much of the Carolinian forest region. Over the past 200 years, the Carolinian forest cover has been reduced to patches, most of which measure less than three hectares. The black rat snake population in this area has been fragmented along with the forest. These snakes now live as a handful of small, isolated groups.  The Frontenac Axis snakes are confined to an area of approximately 5,000 square kilometres. This area includes a small bit of New York State, into which the axis extends. The next nearest group of snakes is 120 kilometres to the south, near Syracuse, New York.  Black rat snake populations in Ontario are isolated from each other and from other populations in the United States. Since they have no way of intermingling with the black rat snakes farther south, they are particularly vulnerable to the pressures of continued loss and alteration of habitat.  Habitat loss and fragmentation have reduced their geographic distribution in Ontario by an estimated 75 percent. Most of the reduction has occurred in the Carolinian region, but there is also evidence of significant range contraction in the Frontenac Axis region.  The increase in the number of roads through black rat snake habitat, and the ever-increasing traffic, spell bad news for black rat snakes. They don't reach sexual maturity until they are 9 or 10 years old. If individuals are to contribute to their population, they not only have to avoid natural predators for a decade, but must also avoid becoming roadkill and being killed or collected by humans.  In 1998, the black rat snake was designated a ""threatened"" species in Canada. This designation means they are likely to become endangered in this country if the factors affecting their vulnerability are not reversed. If their 7,000-year legacy in Canada is to continue, we must dig down to the very old - and twisted - roots of the human/snake relationship.   Let's not let them silently slip away  The situation facing Ontario black rat snakes is strikingly similar to that facing wildlife worldwide. More and more species are being confined to fragmented remnants of their former range; habitat alteration is the leading problem facing all vertebrate groups.  About one in four vertebrate species is limited to small and localized populations, is declining steeply in numbers, or is threatened with extinction. Most biologists believe that we are presently in the middle of one of the great mass extinctions of geologic history. But whereas all of the others were caused by natural phenomena, this one is unique in being brought about by one species: homo sapiens. The dubious distinction is ours.  We still have time to avert the collapse of our living world. The only way to prevent the big picture of mass extinction is to treat each little picture - like black rat snakes in Canada - as vitally important.  Live and let slither Sharing habitat with black rat snakes  Some of us are permanent residents in black rat snake habitat; some of us are seasonal; and some of us may just pass through. Here is a list of things we can do to actively share habitat with black rat snakes.   Consider supporting or volunteering for black rat snake projects at provincial or national parks, such as the ""Adopt a Snake"" programs run by the Friends of Murphys Point and Friends of Charleston Lake Provincial Parks. Reduce driving speed and increase observational skills during spring and fall when black rat snakes are most likely to be basking on roads. At other times of the year, black rat snakes may be crossing the road just to get to the other side. Be mindful! Leave dead or hollow trees on property for basking, shedding and egg-laying sites. They are also beneficial to other wildlife. Leave downed trees and woody debris with rotten cavities because of their importance as egg-laying sites. Start a compost pile for a potential egg-laying site. Don't turn it in July and August, or eggs may be crushed. Leave known hibernacula and the surrounding area undisturbed. Create small brush piles on property. These can serve as places where snakes can escape predators and find prey. Perhaps most importantly, let the snakes be! Recovery Initiatives  In 1999, the Ministry of Natural Resources (MNR) assembled the Black Rat Snake Recovery Team. It consists of a dedicated group of experts from MNR, Ontario Parks, Parks Canada, and Environment Canada - as well as academic researchers from the United States and Canada, and non-government representatives.  Their overall goal is to ensure that black rat snakes remain a healthy component of Canadian biodiversity. To this end, they have developed a recovery strategy and are implementing an action plan. They have set separate medium-term goals for the two population regions. For the Frontenac Axis, the aim is to retain current distribution and connectivity among populations, with no decrease in numbers. For the Carolinian region, they aim to achieve self-sustaining populations, with no further decrease in numbers. They also aim to restore connectivity, or gene flow, among the currently isolated populations.  The recovery team will attempt to coordinate with existing landscape conservation initiatives such as the Algonquin to Adirondacks (A2A) project and Carolinian Canada's ""Big Picture Project.""

236187,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-08-04 22:48:00,0,"Definitely a water snake. There are tons of them around Georgian bay coastlines. They are seen usually just sunning themselves out in the sun. Most likely after having consumed a meal.  But I have had encounters with some aggressive ones!! I once saw a snake swimming in the water. I threw a rock to try to scare it but it came right for me. And was really sneaky about it too, trying to crawl up from the side of the shoreline. I tried to smash a rock on it, but somehow it was still alive! The second time I got him with a bigger rock and almost split him in half! I went to go investigate it and the thing lunged at me! It was like Jason! It wouldn't die!! Then I grabbed a stick and put it throw his mouth and it was dead. That day I had a very ominous unsettling feeling, unlike i have ever felt before, even up to this day......  As far as RAF's posts? There are tons of Rattlesnakes near Killbear provincial park. I think the government actually has a program that breeds them up there. They apparently have a rodent infestation and the best way they felt to deal with it is to give them a natural enemy. I think it is not so smart, breeding them in an area that has a provincial park and a lot of kids running around....."
234273,Cudz,2008-07-30 02:52:00,2652,"Seeing as Rf posted some cool pics of that Mass ratler, I thought I would show this.  I was at a cottage the other day and I saw this snake on the dock.  As I approached it swam away into the water.  This thing is not small and looks nasty.  Anyway I walk to the end of the dock and the snake doubles back on me and climbs (somehow) onto the dock.  The stupid thing starts coming toward me and I am on the end of the dock.  Are you kidding me.  LOL.  My friends a the other end of the dock are peeing themselves because I am stuck with the snake between me and the land.  After a 20 second standoff I decided to jump over it.  I ran toward it and jumped over it.  It may be a stretch but I think it tried to bite me during the jump (luckily I have good up).  I was laughing the whole time as well. Anyone know what kind of snake it is. It was in muskoka. "
234279,Raf,2008-07-30 03:01:00,3495,definately an anaconda.  looks like a water snake.
234282,Nemo,2008-07-30 03:05:00,727,"Northern Water Snake maybe one of these.  There are four subspecies: Nerodia sipedon sipedon, Northern water snake Nerodia sipedon pleuralis, Midland water snake Nerodia sipedon insularum, Lake Erie water snake Nerodia sipedon williamengelsi, Carolina water snake  This is a great reference.  http://www.scisnake.com/download/snakesreferenceguide.pdf   "
234288,danbo,2008-07-30 03:19:00,2646,"They can dive underwater too! Some get kinda brave & come at you. I have a pet Milk snake myself. They eat frogs & mice. They can swallow prey whole, up to 1.5 times their own girth."
234290,muskymike,2008-07-30 03:28:00,772,Looks like a Water Snake
234295,mukluk,2008-07-30 03:45:00,196,Looks like a Water Moccassin to me. They are found throughout Muskoka and Haliburton Highlands. Not poisoness; but sometimes aggressive!
234296,smbhunter,2008-07-30 03:46:00,186,"It's a water snake. They are normally quite aggressive, but this one was a little crazy."
234298,Wild,2008-07-30 03:54:00,704,"And these suckers can get big too! Once in Dillon there was one that must have been 36 ft long, luckily the local dock dog loved to play with these snakes and chase them into the water so I was told the next day... that's how long it took me to walk back after running 1/4 mile across the bay over two hills and  1 steep rock cliff. That was the week I realized that I can run on water."
234302,Cudz,2008-07-30 04:49:00,2652,"36ft?  wow.  lol  I have been told since that it was indeed a water snake but it looked scary and despite the fact that I knew it wasn't a massasauga rattler (which is onltario's only poisonous snake), it still looked poisonous.  Freakin snake was not shy at all."
234306,4thgen,2008-07-30 10:16:00,157,"Yep, northern watersnake. A water moccasin is also known as a cottonmouth and definately is not found in Ontario, more the southern States. Northern watersnakes are typically really agressive and will bite alot if you catch them. It hurts but other than that they're harmless. I'm pretty sure they can get up to around 4ft (rarely though)."
234310,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-07-30 10:47:00,1362," I keep thinking about you jumping over that snake....if he would have struck directly above you while you were jumpin' over him, the first point of contact with your body would have been your gems  .....OUCH!!!!!!!...I'm gettin' the shivers just thinking bout that!!"
234333,modny,2008-07-30 12:47:00,502,"one time , many years ago, i was cornered by one of these snakes, i jumped over it and it nearly bit me in my "" bull frog"""
234343,Almontefisher,2008-07-30 13:27:00,18,Yup water snake...used to catch them when I was a kid out of Clayton lake...They are aggresive but non venomous...Hits hard with a nice bite but you will survive as I am still standing...May be not as smart as I was but they are not dangerous.  They dive very well and can stay underwater for about 3 minutes or so.  Fun snake to play with as a kid.
234377,highdrifter,2008-07-30 15:39:00,2534," Water Moccasin?!!  That species is not found in North America, and is poisonous!!  tisk tisk  HD"
234385,ricoboxing,2008-07-30 16:03:00,398,"NOooo., thats a black mamba! you are lucky to be alive!!"
234405,Dabluz,2008-07-30 17:24:00,701,"Water moccasins or cottonmouths are found in N.America.....in the southern U.S.  Yes...they are poisonous.  The snake on the dock may be a water snake but water snakes have a yellower belly and are brown with patterns on it's back....some have very nice patterns. This snake looks a lot like a black snake that have a white belly.  Black snakes are quite agressive.  In the area around Gananoqué near Kingston, there is a type of black snake called the Black Rat Snake that can get to 108 inches long....maybe more."
234406,4thgen,2008-07-30 17:32:00,157," As I said earlier, the water moccasin or cottonmouth is native to the south eastern states which is still North America (last time I checked). There's no sense in correcting someone with more misinformation..."
234409,Dabluz,2008-07-30 17:38:00,701,Those snakes from the south will probably migrate north into Canada due to global warming.  I have an old American Wildlife  field guide and some of those snakes were found just south of the Great Lakes.
234414,addy79,2008-07-30 17:54:00,573,"these are all over teh parry sound area! they swim right at you while floating around on the noodle...  have to admit i haven't let em get to close, wonder if they will bite in the water?? i know those really poisonous sea snakes wouldn't dare to bite you while in the water  they are pretty aggressive nonetheless"
234415,kissmybass,2008-07-30 17:58:00,36,"concensus seems to be water snake... either way, good job jumping for your life! lol i would have done the same (i hate snakes!)"
234419,swahrer,2008-07-30 18:09:00,28,"Sorry, that is too funny!  I remember their being quite a few in the Burnt River as a kid.  They are freaky to see swim up beside you in the canoe.  Nothing a padle doesn't fix though!"
234427,highdrifter,2008-07-30 18:35:00,2534," OK southern states, N. A.  The point is we don't get water moccasins up here, so no one need grab their oar next time they encounter a water snake.  yyeeeessshhh HD"
234439,Zubris21,2008-07-30 18:54:00,563,"I think its the northern Water snake as well.  Someone mentioned a Black Rat Snake, but I doubt this, that would be one small black rat (smallest I've seen is about 3-4ft), and black rats are usually deep in the woods, as opposed to hanging out on docks.  Non the less, they are pretty similar species in terms of their markings."
234452,Dabluz,2008-07-30 19:35:00,701,"  The only poisonous snake in Canada is the Massauga Rattler.  I have never heard of anyone dying after being bitten.  The snake is so shy that it quickly hides.  It is not agressive in the least.  I imagine that the day someone is seriously injured or dies from a snake bite, the news papers and tv news will certainly make a big thing of it."
234458,addy79,2008-07-30 19:43:00,573," Parry Sound water snakes must be high then...  they swim right for you in the water, like i said, never been bit and i know...they are NOT venomous"
