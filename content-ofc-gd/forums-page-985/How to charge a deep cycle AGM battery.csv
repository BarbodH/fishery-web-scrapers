235451,forrest,2008-08-02 02:18:00,1032,"I just bought an Optima AGM deep cycle marine battery (Costco sells them for $176, walmart $234)  I also have a CTC Intellegent charger (one of the Schumacher ones).  It has 2 setting I have to make:  1) Charge current 10A, 6A, 2A 2) reg, AGM, Deep cycle.  Well my battery is a Deep cycle AGM.  I can't pick both AGM and Deepcycle.  What am I to do?    forrest BTW: this charger won't do for keeping a top up charge on the battery...I need a 1A charger for that."
235464,forrest,2008-08-02 03:26:00,1032,"Maybe this extra info will be useful to someone in the know.  This is the information from the battery spec sheet: Alternator: 13.65 to 15.0 volts Battery Charger (Constant Voltage): 13.8 to 15.0 volts; 10 amps maximum; 6-12 hours approximate Float Charge: 13.2 to 13.8 volts; 1 amp maximum (indefinite time at lower voltages) Rapid Recharge:(Constant voltage charger) Maximum voltage 15.6 volts. No current limit as long as battery temperature remains below 125째F (51.7째C). Charge until current drops below 1 amp. Cyclic or Series String Applications: 14.7 volts. No current limit as long as battery temperature remains below 125째F (51.7째C). When current falls below 1 amp, finish with 2 amp constant current for 1 hour. All limits must be strictly adhered to. I think this means that I can charge this battery at 10A until I hit 15V and then manually stop the charger. what is ""cyclic or series string applications"" mean?  What charger can I get that will let me make these setting.....my cahrger manual is not specific on what it is doing when charging.  forrest"

235487,Thomas13,2008-08-02 11:45:00,6,"I think your safe with the deep cycle setting (that is if your optima is a deep cycle) although Optima batteries are AGM they have a very low internal resistance and can accept high currents. You can use any charger on an OPTIMA as long as the voltage is regulated properly. If your charger will remain on indefinitely, the voltage should be at 13.8 volts maximum with a one amp maximum current. (This is straight from the Optima web site). You should be good to go with the charger you have now."
235491,Thomas13,2008-08-02 11:48:00,6,  I'd go with their recommendation.
235498,forrest,2008-08-02 12:46:00,1032,  Thanks Lundby....great stuff.  I want to go fishing today and the manufacturers are closed.  forrest
