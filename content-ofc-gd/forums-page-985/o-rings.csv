235201,blarg,2008-08-01 14:40:00,289,"i want to try wacky rigging senkos, ive seen them done with little o-rings, i was wondering where id be likely to find some the right size, crappy tire maybe?"
235203,keram,2008-08-01 14:43:00,585,plumbing or lawn watering section
235205,douG,2008-08-01 14:44:00,2693,Sure.  Look in the plumbing section.  A Home Depot might be a better place.  A Staples store would have some rubber elastic bands that would work too.
235206,mikeh,2008-08-01 14:45:00,824,"bass pro shops has them fairly cheap (10 cents each)as do most fishing stores. canadian tire sells them for about 80 cents each, in the plumbing section."

235208,cranks bait,2008-08-01 14:46:00,721,"My brother in law got the kit from BPS.  A handy tube to roll them onto the Senko.  I thought about making my own as I have several scrap tubes that size.  The o-ring can be purchased at any hard ware store easily enough.  Then I noticed that his didn't really last that much longer than mine, and I always had my lure in the water first.  Needless to say, I haven't gotten around to doing it yet and probably won't.  Altough it is a pretty slick set up.  The other thing that gets me is all those rubber donounts (mmmm donouts) floting around when they do break off."
235209,Greencoachdog,2008-08-01 14:47:00,8163,"Try a small piece of heat shrink tubing! I buy the 3/8"" diameter that shrinks to 3/16"". Cut a small piece about 1/4"" wide, slip it over your worm and heat with a Bic lighter for a tight durable fit!  You'll find it in the electrical section of Home Depot."
235211,JohnF,2008-08-01 14:50:00,3494," I tried the local CTC. Some nice guy behind the parts counter gave me (yup, gave) all he had (6) in the approximate sizes I needed. He suggested the plumbing dept but there was nothing there. The rings have to be a fairly tight fit or the fish will pull the worm out. I'm gonna try a supply shop that has all kinds of pneumatic and hydraulic fittings. They might have a better selection. Or if you know a place that stocks small engine carb parts they might have some. Look for something under a 1/4"", 3/16"" something like that with some stretch to it. Some don't have enough give and will just break if you try to stretch them.  JF"
235217,cranks bait,2008-08-01 14:57:00,721,"Oh ya, I forgot.  I just picked up a box of o-rings in various sizes at Princess Auto for my father in law.  It was something like $2.00 for a gizillion rings."

235238,bassjnkie,2008-08-01 15:43:00,1101,"The kit at Bass pro is $5.99 included ring and slider tube, don't remember what the extra rings cost, or got to ebay for the exra rings, dime a dozen. The ones at ctc have a funky rubber smell to them, and they don't fit right.  Hope this helps, Daniel OCH"
235241,BillM,2008-08-01 15:53:00,17367,I think GCD is onto something here with shrink tubing...
235248,oncogene,2008-08-01 16:06:00,154,"The tube+ring ""kit"" from BPS is $5.99 as other have already mentioned. The replacement 10-pack rings are $1.9x if i remember correctly."
235254,Cudz,2008-08-01 16:13:00,2652,you can also use surgical tubing.  cut it into small pieces and use needlenose pliers to stretch the tubing over the bait.
235310,Oktravis,2008-08-01 18:18:00,62,"a good place for o-rings is any automotive jobber(napa ,part source,delco to name a few).they should have a good assortment.princess auto is also a good place(i love that place)"
235336,fishing n autograph,2008-08-01 19:48:00,2540,o rings.....hmmm.....wait you're talkin' about fishin right???
235434,oncogene,2008-08-02 00:19:00,154,"  oh forgot to mention... on Ebay it's $2 for 100  with my address shipping is only $2 flat, even if u order 200,300."
