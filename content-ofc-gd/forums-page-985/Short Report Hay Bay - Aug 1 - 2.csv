Marked tons of fish and even more TONS of baitfish schools..  Saturday, we fished near Thompsons Cove as there were over 24 boats in Mallory Bay (it was the hot spot). We landed a walleye in the first 45 minutes and thought we were on the way - Sad to say it was a false start.  We continued to troll that area and Laker John had a HUGE strike, we thought immediately of sheepshead, this fish took a lot of drag and fought a noble fight, but finally we were abloe to put the net under the fish.  What a giant..................................    I held the fish and John took a snap.  We weighed the fish, but it pulled the scale to the bottom of the 25LB mark and went past it, we estimate that the fish was close to 30LB.  That was our excitement for the day as we caught a couple of small eyes, but nothing to weigh in.  The winners from Perfect Vue had a nice bag of four fish and combined woth the pail weight was over 13 lbs.  Everyone had a good time with the BBQ and Prize give out.  Thanks to Perfect Vue Campers Committee for their efforts.  Bayview Resort  Derbu  next weekend, tix available at Dew Drop Inn, Perfect Vue, Bayview Resort and from the campers of Bayview Resort.  Stay Tuned."
