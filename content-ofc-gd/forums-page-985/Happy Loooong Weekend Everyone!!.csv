As I sit here, strapped to the shackles of my dest, in my dungeon of manuals and stat reports, in this hell with fluorescents lights, I dream of wide open spaces, the gental wake of my canoe in a mirror calm lake, the surge of excitement from a smallie hitting my top water bait..  Off to the Kawarthas for moi!!  Fishing, board sports, bbqs, cold bizzles... all with my best mates.  Hope everyone has a safe long weekend, filled with frosty man sodas and fishy goodness!  Giggity giggity... alright!  HD"

235418,Canuck2fan,2008-08-01 23:37:00,1444," Actually I enjoy working on the Monday, I will get enough done so that I will only have to put about an hour on Tuesday and probably be finished at both jobs by 11AM Monday at the latest (mainly because without managemant around I can start at 2AM LOL). So I will have the rivers and lakes all to myself after about 9AM on Tuesday when I get out there.  So really as long as it rains once really hard over Friday night to soak all the drunken little teenagers who are off ""camping"" so I have to work Saturday morning I won't be bitter at all about that either. LOL"

I've had an amazing week of fishing thus far (PB bucketmouths and smallies, walleye and the odd pike), and I'm currently sitting at the inlaws' in Sudbury and will be heading out in 2 hours to camp for the night and hit a serious backwoods speck hole! I'll talk to you next week when I return to the metropolis!"
