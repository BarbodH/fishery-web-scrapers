235353,Burtess,2008-08-01 20:18:00,901,"I emailed the link (http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=22303) to the OMNR and received this response (CLofchik is correct):  Hi Kevin  Thanks for bringing this photo to our attention.  It does indeed appear to be a chinook salmon.  One feature we use to help identify salmon and trout in the field is the shape of the anal fin.  If you look closely, you'll see that the fish in the photo has an sharply-angled anal fin, with a short leading edge (characteristic of chinook salmon at this size).  The identification of salmon and trout from Lake Ontario can be challenging.  We are currently working on a field guide to help anglers positively identify their catch.  We are very much interested in hearing from anglers who encounter Atlantic salmon in the open lake, as part of a multi-partner effort to restore this native species to Lake Ontario.  Among other things, we'd like to know when and where Atlantic salmon are being caught and how big they are (total length).  A good photo would be helpful for identification.  Until we have online reporting capability on the website, you can submit Atlantic salmon observations by e-mail ([email protected]).  The current limit for Atlantic salmon in Lake Ontario is one fish over 63 cm (24.8 inches) for a Sport Fishing Licence (0 for Conservation Fishing Licence).  Atlantic salmon are closed all year to fishing in Lake Ontario tributaries.  We would encourage anglers to live-release fish if they are at all uncertain about identification.  If you wish to find out more about the Lake Ontario Atlantic Salmon Restoration Program and partnership, here is a link to our website:  http://www.bringbackthesalmon.ca/.  For information about Lake Ontario fisheries and fish communities, check out our annual reports on the Great Lakes Fishery Commission website:  http://www.glfc.org/lakecom/loc/mgmt_unit/homepage2006.htm.  Our 2007 report will be posted there soon.  Thanks again.  I hope you have a succesful fishing season.

Could anyone shed some light on this? Thanks, Kevin  So there we have it!  Burt"
235373,ecmilley,2008-08-01 21:33:00,2163,thanks that ends that debate. tillers are better
235387,aniceguy,2008-08-01 22:02:00,1094,it was an interesting thread thats for sure.........
235390,GBW,2008-08-01 22:13:00,8460,"I swear I told you all it was a nice fish but did ya listen, nooo....  glad to see this all got sorted out too."
235494,bushart,2008-08-02 12:15:00,2628,One may kinda assume the apologies will be flooding in to ole Clofchik--Poor guy probably hurt his back digging a 10 foot deep hole to hide the carcass on the advice of some experts.  Ok boys back to the piers in the armpit of Ontario.
235497,Greencoachdog,2008-08-02 12:44:00,8163,Seems some folks worked themselves into a terrible snit for nothing eh?
235503,Wild,2008-08-02 13:35:00,704,Geeze I thought YOU people knew your fish!
235505,Greencoachdog,2008-08-02 13:48:00,8163," It is very entertaining to go back and read the original thread with all the ""experts"" claiming it to be an Atlantic and even the concensus of the readers of another board I.D.ing it as an Atlantic. *insert snicker here*"
235506,Roy,2008-08-02 13:54:00,13728,If the MNR dude failed biology class do we re-open the 'discussion'?           I'm only kidding! MNR dudes are never wrong!
235507,bushart,2008-08-02 14:02:00,2628,"I used to guide deer hunters and the story was much the same---guy crawls outta the cubicle he works 360 days a year --comes up north---gets to pee in the bush---now has the expertise of Joe Two Rivers.  I avoid with a passion any statement that is absolute when it comes to the outdoors---those words are just too hard to eat---yet there is a sizable portion of the population that I guess gets a thrill of ""being a Giver of knowledge"" aka ""expert""  Can I Have a ""Well Said""  Bushart"
235508,Greencoachdog,2008-08-02 14:16:00,8163," Well Said!!!  ... sometimes even the ""Guides"" are wrong eh!"
235511,Burtess,2008-08-02 14:32:00,901,"  The link I posted from the other board was for the pic I posted, not of the original posters fish.  The way I read the email I received was that it referred to the original posters fish, not mine.  Was the fish I caught last year an atlantic? Maybe I should have asked them to comment on that one as well lol...  Burt"
235512,highdrifter,2008-08-02 14:33:00,2534,"HAH!!  To all the bucket biologists who doubted that this was a chinook, lemme just spread on the cheese a little...  Mind you, the person who caught the fish was really the only one who could positively identify the fish, and he had it right the first time.  So there ya have it.  cheers HD"
235528,JEREMY,2008-08-02 16:49:00,300,Now did he catch it on a marshmellow though  .
235570,Fishmaster,2008-08-02 22:28:00,920,I still wouldn't bealive what they say ...most MNR have never even caught a fish before ..i still say Alantic ...
235577,Greencoachdog,2008-08-02 22:41:00,8163,"     Yeah, they just work for the MNR because they were underqualified for a position with Tim Hortons.  ... and Mickeys D's was full up."
235580,Fishmaster,2008-08-02 22:48:00,920,LOL
235589,Canuck2fan,2008-08-02 23:34:00,1444,I think that once the MNR gives a judgement that should be good enough for everyone. Especially with just one digital pic of a fish.  I do like how the MNR experts are working on a guide to help us identify different species though LOL. Probably will be ready about 2015 or so. Then they will wonder why all the atlantics they are working so very hard re-establish aren't taking hold.
235702,aniceguy,2008-08-03 13:21:00,1094,"Let me try and end this one the MNR staff who commented on the fish and I are on quite good terms, she knows her fish 100% trust me here....I dont think this thread was meant as an mnr bash, or worse a bash at the minimum wage people around..the fish is a nook plain and simple let the thread die before it goes to never never land and someone somewhere ends up with a foot in the mouth"
235705,salmon,2008-08-03 13:25:00,334," Well said Louis, agree 100%  Jose"
235772,Rich,2008-08-03 21:57:00,3927,better withdraw that one..
