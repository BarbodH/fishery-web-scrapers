580935,aplumma,2011-05-09 12:02:00,6896,Question answered have a good day folks.   Art
580749,CrankbaitJon,2011-05-08 22:29:00,13,"Hi all,  I've been finding game fish for sale at certain Chinese supermarkets in the past few years.  Species I saw are Northern Pike, Walleye, Crappie, Rockbass and Bluegills.  I just saw a tank full of Rockbass last week and some were smaller than palm sized.  Being a catch and release guy this naturally disgusted me.  I called the OMNR every time I come across this but since these finds pops up time and time again I wonder if anyone else actually call and report.  The kicker is, there's a sign on the tank that says ""Wild Caught"".    CBJ"
580753,Roy,2011-05-08 22:34:00,13728,The walleye and pike in almost every supermarket are wild fish.
580756,Mike01,2011-05-08 22:38:00,378,"Not something we see up here(North Bay), but I would imagine it's actually quite prevalent down South.  I would certainly be calling the MNR anytime I see something like that, every tip helps.  Although, I'm guessing it would be hard to determine if they were legally caught/purchased"
580761,bigugli,2011-05-08 22:51:00,6138,"You can get pike fillets at Sobey's from Manitoba. Fresh, live fish are brought in from outside the province all the time. Some are farm raised, some are netted.  Some are poached. With tank loads of live fish it is not uncommon to have a tank of stripers with a  few crappie and lm bass  as bicatch from south of the border."
580766,dhickey,2011-05-08 23:07:00,1038,As far as I understand it is only Native Americans that can catch and sell native fish within Canadian borders? Without a comercial licence . And Rockbass /pike/and fresh water bass are not on the list of comercial fish.  ????  If I am wrong let me know.
580791,cram,2011-05-09 00:10:00,1733,would be really surprised if you could sell live ones in a tank.  Call the MNR.
580800,bigugli,2011-05-09 00:23:00,6138,"Special licences are required, but there are numerous fish markets with live tanks"
580805,irishfield,2011-05-09 00:28:00,26272,Why do we do this twice a month?
580806,Roy,2011-05-09 00:34:00,13728,hahahaha I know Wayne....just gets to be funny after a while. Funny retarded.
580807,CrankbaitJon,2011-05-09 00:34:00,13,"Yea, I've called every time I saw something like that.  I think native Americans can sell them but I doubt they do business with these supermarkets.  I don't go to these supermarkets often so I can't really tell if the OMNR has actually visited them or not.  I'm 99% sure they are wild caught game fish.  The pike tend to be there in numbers no greater than 5 and the pan fish are in large numbers.  The supermarkets are in Toronto and Markham region.  I can confirm that selling them is illegal as that's what the OMNR officer told me.  CBJ"

580809,irishfield,2011-05-09 00:37:00,26272,"Please do a search here and read the last 4 or 5 times this has come up since Christmas. They do indeed give out licences to catch Crappie, to sell in local supermarkets.."
580811,cram,2011-05-09 00:42:00,1733, and largies and pike?
580815,irishfield,2011-05-09 00:50:00,26272,A quick google gives me this.. 
580816,timmeh,2011-05-09 00:50:00,609,Those guys who take 300 fish from the kawartha lakes have to sell them somewhere.
580818,Sandbag,2011-05-09 00:52:00,533,  I suspect there are alot of people that only come on the site twice a month.  I know that I don't research every topic in the archives before I post or comment on them.  Give the guys some slack.  Cheers  Craig

580844,cram,2011-05-09 01:37:00,1733,I really doubt someone is farming northern pike and selling them to supermarkets.
580847,irishfield,2011-05-09 01:38:00,26272,"Well sorry I can't please you tonight Cram.. run right down there and stand there until the MNR show up, after calling a CO. Want one of their personal cell numbers?.. I have at least 5 in my phone."
580872,lookinforwalleye,2011-05-09 02:28:00,4399,Why are so many people always looking to attack the Chinese  This past weekend at my lake there were people fishing for crappie and there were numerous buckets and pails full of fish many fish over the limit and all these people were wasp`s.
580875,Joey,2011-05-09 02:31:00,9122, I was at Seafood Depot in Woodbridge a week ago and they had lots of pike in there for sale.
580878,mercman,2011-05-09 02:39:00,7054,"  It's media hype and stereotyping.Ever watch ""Wild Justce"" They always show them harassing chinese fishmarkets and such.Its a bloody shame and i dont even bother watching the show anymore."
580899,Sinker,2011-05-09 03:55:00,8692,"Get your fresh caught crappies here.......only $8.99/lb.  I'm not even kidding. I've seen it too. I'm not sure of the legalities of it all, but I know they can do it somehow. How they prove they were actually purchased from a licensed dealer is beyond me though.......What kind of fish farm raises 5"" crappie and rockbass for sale???   S."
