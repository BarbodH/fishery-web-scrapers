544867,mercman,2011-01-28 23:50:00,7054,Ford Escape man......Youy wont regret it.Deal him into putting the towing pack on it for free and buy it.
544870,scugpg,2011-01-28 23:58:00,1373," Its by far the best price, and I really trust the brand and dealer I work with around here. I keep coming back to that even though the others are a bit more refined and better on gas by a bit."
544873,duxbware,2011-01-29 00:00:00,102,Get the escape!!! I have owned two since 2001. I take that vehicle through anything and ever get stuck. Great on fuel and comfortable to drive. It also tows great. I towed a 16ft with a 50 Merc fully loaded  with a weeks worth of gear no issues.
544874,Jer,2011-01-29 00:01:00,1426,"  Not even close.  My buddy had a 2005 from new, recently traded it in for a 2010. He couldn't be happier. Real nice vehicle, no comparison to Jeep or Dodge.  My girlfriend drives a 2004 Mitsubishi Lancer. It's nothing fancy, but reliable as hell. Again, no comparison to a Neon.  I wouldn't be brand shy. My buddy hasn't towed with either of his Outlanders, so I don't know how they rate in that regard, but certainly a quality vehicle."
544876,scugpg,2011-01-29 00:02:00,1373, Is that with the 4 or 6cyl?
544886,lookinforwalleye,2011-01-29 00:28:00,4399," I don`t want to preach but if your going to load up the vehicle with your family and tow a boat get a 6 cylinder,you put that much wear and tear on a 4 banger your gas mileage is not going to be great. And just a heads up check the specs of the 4 cylinder Escape it does not come with a hitch option and there is no stated tow capacity care to guess on why that is? I would think if you put an after markey hitch on the 4 banger Escape and went to the dealer for some warranty work you might have a problem.  I think you`ll be much further ahead with a 6 cyl. I know the upfront cost is more but in the long run I think you`ll be better off.  Try a 2008 or 2009 model to save a few bucks."
544897,Muskieman,2011-01-29 00:43:00,2472," They're all built from the same platform...just look different. fit and finish might be different as well as the seating as for bells and whistles.  Strip 'em down and in most cases they share the same powertrain , suspensions, and braking systems.  Just like Fords and Mazda.. GMC and Suzuki..(domestic imports)  I know what you mean... but the basics are usually the same...  It would be like comparing a high end Lincoln MKZ to a low end Mazda 6  Randy "
544952,Terry,2011-01-29 02:41:00,14456," but how often do you really tow your boat and load down the vehicle I drove a 4 cyl nissan pickup and towed a 18ft bassboat with a 150 on it.........the 200,000 km I put on it says it handled the towing pretty well...when towing I didn't go 140km and it got bad gas mileage when towing the boat, but that was about 20 days a year so the great mileage the other 300 and something days a year made a big difference ..and when I towed the snowmobile it didn't have any trouble hardy knew it was there"
544954,Roy,2011-01-29 02:44:00,13728,"Terry, there's 45 days missing in your year."
545034,scugpg,2011-01-29 12:17:00,1373," That's exactly it, not making big road trips with the boat behind and 95% is going to be city driving. Won't be loaded up all the time either. That's why 4cyl AWD seems to make sense."
545062,irishfield,2011-01-29 14:46:00,26272, He's unionized.. those are his sick days!
545068,mercman,2011-01-29 14:58:00,7054," I leased one for my bussiness for a couple of years.It was alot of fun, and never gave me problems.in 2006 i was getting overall 8.1L/100k which is pretty good for an suv.it was a 4cyl.4cl is a bit noisier than the 6."
545089,lookinforwalleye,2011-01-29 16:25:00,4399,    And throw in a few personal days for good measure.
545110,Fishnwire,2011-01-29 17:04:00,983,"  There's nothing else to say...except ""Rubicon""."
545301,lookinforwalleye,2011-01-30 00:08:00,4399,"Well it just goes to show you nothing is for sure, the wife has been wanting to get rid of the gas guzzling Durango for a while now and she wakes up this morning and says lets go shopping... I figured she wanted to go buy food but she says vehicle... Well the other day I said in another thread I said I would never buy new because of depreciation blah blah, she says she wants to drive a Escape and a Journey I think she was doing a little research because she know what she was looking for. Well to make a long story short she fell in love with Dodge Journey and she ended up with a new Journey R/T fully loaded including navigation,back-up camera,6 CD,leather,sunroof,chrome wheels,tow package,AWD,etc,etc.  With the incentives and finacing deals they have now I could not say no being the end of the month and all they were sure aggressive to make the sale,the fully loaded Journey was almost the same price as a basic FWD Escape!  I have never been able to say no to my wife!  "
545308,irishfield,2011-01-30 00:24:00,26272,LOL.. welcome to the dark side Gord !!
580694,scugpg,2011-05-08 18:57:00,1373, Do you know if the back gate could open with a trailer on? it doesn't come with a vertical back gate.  I think it's down to the new equinox or the rav4. Nox is really but really big and heavy for what I need and visibility and mileage is not as good as ratings from what I read.  Wish the new escape would come out but not until q2 2012 from what I hear but hard to say if will even be any good side from power train.
580700,Sinker,2011-05-08 19:13:00,8692,"If you can't open the back hatch because of the boat, add a couple feet to the tongue of your trailer. A welding shop can do this real quick, easy, and cheap. I had to do the same. Makes backing up the trailer a little easier too with the longer wheel base.  S."
580903,John Bacon,2011-05-09 04:42:00,3277, Our gate swings out like a normal door.  I am not sure if there are any other gate options for a RAV4.  I think that you could open the door at least part way on most trailers.  You may be able to open it all the way if the trailer has a long tongue.
580907,cram,2011-05-09 04:56:00,1733,"Have you looked at Subaru Foresters?  Also 4 cylinder, great interior space, and similar in size/price to a rav4.  Better crash scores.  Not as fun to drive though."
580911,Sinker,2011-05-09 05:29:00,8692,"I drive a forester XT, and I tell ya, it is a lot more fun to drive than any other compact SUV I've been in!! I've driven the RAV4's, escape, tribute, and terrain. None of them compare on the road to the XT. S."
580919,scugpg,2011-05-09 10:28:00,1373,The forester takes premium gas only with that turboFrom what I'm reading. Nice vehicle though.
580944,cram,2011-05-09 12:59:00,1733, There's a non turbo.
542795,scugpg,2011-01-23 18:40:00,1373,I might be in the market soon for a small SUV so I was wondering what you guys are happy with? Test drove a couple escapes yesterday but open to a Rav4 and a few others.  I'll be pulling a small tinny but I imagine I will end up with a larger 16ft tinny or side console at some point. Boat will probably be less than 1500lbs. So I'm kinda stuck on whether to go with the bigger motor and/or 2wd or AWD.  Any advice or experience with this scenario would be appreciated
542803,livinisfishin,2011-01-23 18:48:00,661,Get the bigger motor. I drive a tribute with a four cylinder..my gas mileage isn't that good at all. I would get the all wheel drive aswell!
542809,SlowPoke,2011-01-23 18:54:00,2984, Go with the console
542812,jjcanoe,2011-01-23 19:03:00,744,"2 man flip up hut, side console boat....  any type of towing and, I mean any type go, with a bare minimum of a V6.  4 cyl with all the weight of the suv will be bad on gas, my wife has a 4cyl Tucson and she is regretting not getting the V6, (and she doesn't tow anything)  4wd is great for our SW ont winters and that extra juice on a steep boat launch  Tucson has been a decent vehicle so far (3 1/2 years old)  jjcanoe"
542817,Big Cliff,2011-01-23 19:17:00,6899,"Well, I had a Nissan Frontier crew cab and loved it, it would pull anything, selectable 4WD, Lo and High range and the gas milage was quite good.  I have also had a Nissan X-Trail, again not bad milage and good towing ability although not nearly as good as the Frontier was.  4WD or AWD are really handy both on winter roads and on ramps. Selectable will save you gas money when it isn't needed.  Right now I am driving a Subaru Forester AWD. Very comfortable, handles well, I haven't tried to tow anything too heavy, my ATV which is about 600 lbs but you wouldn't even know it was there. Gas milage isn't that good but comparable I guess for an AWD."
542826,scugpg,2011-01-23 19:36:00,1373,Thanks for the replies so far yes it's getting tough to find selectable 4wd most are all our just two now
542835,BillM,2011-01-23 19:51:00,17367,I'd look at a 4Runner..   Nice and comfy with REAL 4WD bits when you need them.
542839,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-01-23 19:59:00,0,"as far as ""small"" suv's go, i haven't like one more than the hyundai sante fe.  now my father, mother, aunt/uncle, sister, and best fishing chum all drive one, and none have any mechanical issue other than a brake job.  also, the full heated seat warmers is by far the greatest thing after a cold day of ice fishing!"
542848,Sinker,2011-01-23 20:15:00,8692,"Don't over look the subaru forester's. Great vehicle. Get a turbo and you can haul your boat around with ease. I tow a 16ft deep and wide, fully loaded, with no issues at all. The thing will go anywhere!! Take a look at the reviews. The only downfall is gas mileage, but that's what ya get with AWD.  S."
542865,ckrb2007,2011-01-23 21:03:00,449,"I have a 2007 Toyota FJ Cruiser and couldn't be happier with it. I tow my friends boats, my ATV all around and it's awesome. Another plus is it fits my fish trap guide in the back.  It does have the selectable 2wd or 4wd option....along with the locking diff and A-TRAC which basically transfers power to the wheels that aren't spinning. It has the 4 litre V6, 245hp engine which is more then enough power. I've taken in back lake fishing/camping and last year the family drove to Cape Breton, Nova Scotia and PEI......a 6000km trip with no problems.    Cheers, Colin"
542883,Fishnwire,2011-01-23 22:00:00,983,"Get a Jeep Rubicon, lift 'er up a good half a foot and slap a set of 36 inch Super Swampers on there.  2WD, 4W high, 4W low, locking front and rear dif...all on demand.  Tow whatever you want.  You have to forego decent gas mileage.  But you can also forego the presence of actual roads."
542892,scugpg,2011-01-23 22:31:00,1373,Fuel economy is a must for the new vehicle....so a Jeep is out  Thanks for the suggestions guys I'll do some digging on those models.  Cheers.
542899,siwash,2011-01-23 22:49:00,683,  Find a used X-Trail  I own one.. a very underrated vehicle.. tows 2000lb and is a little snow machine..  plenty if utility. LOVE IT
542917,Steve_R,2011-01-24 00:12:00,81,Im in the same boat has you Scugog lol. I never got that Escape..now im thinking about getting the Ford Edge or a 4x4 Escape.
542930,scugpg,2011-01-24 00:59:00,1373, I drove an edge on the weekend and really didn't like it.
542940,Steve_R,2011-01-24 01:26:00,81,l dont mind it at all...but l still like the 4x4 v6 Escape better.Your buying a new boat? let me know what your going to do with your old boat..im looking at getting a 14 footer for small lakes like fanshawe and wildwood...
542977,Pikeslayer,2011-01-24 02:35:00,1443,"At the very least, test drive a Hyundai and research on line. We have four (2 x Accent, Elantra & Veracruz) in the family and I honestly got to say, that they are the best vehicles we ever owned. BTW, I believe the Santa Fe has a towing capacity of 3500 lbs.  Good Luck, Pikeslayer"

543003,Nipfisher,2011-01-24 03:27:00,2449,"I LOVE my 2004 Explorer Sportrac. Bigger box would be great but pulls everything I have (utility trailer for bike/sled, and 17' alum boat package) with ease. Great 4 wheel drive and lots of room in the back seat for my boys (booster seat and child seat) and sometimes my wife too when the dog gets shotgun lol.  Now, my one complaint....It is maxed at 16"" tires. You would have to lengthen the axles or put a super lift kit into it to go bigger."
543047,fish_fishburn,2011-01-24 14:26:00,1311,The Toyota FJ Cruiser are a real nice vehicle. Unfortunately they have the lousiest fuel milage of all SUV's
543052,Northque,2011-01-24 15:40:00,8,"I've got no complaints about my 2010 Escape.  Only options on it are V6 and 4WD.  240HP is plenty of power for a small SUV.  Haven't tried towing with it and don't have the tow package so I can't help you there, but it shouldn't have any trouble pulling a small boat.  On a side note, the traction and stability control likes to kick in immediately when things start to go sideways.  It works great and puts power down to all 4 wheels, but it's not as fun as my old YJ."
544863,scugpg,2011-01-28 23:40:00,1373,"Well I did some driving and researching and I decided that I want to go with a 4cyl 4x4 model. I have it down to:  Chevy Eqinox/GMC Terrain Ford Escape Mitsubishi Outlander  Do you guys know anything about the Mitsubishi line of vehicles? Really liked this vehicle but kinda shy to that brand. Escape is a proven design, but really like the new Terrain and the direct injection motor."
544865,Roy,2011-01-28 23:45:00,13728,Get yourself a Jeep Wrangler and be done with it.
