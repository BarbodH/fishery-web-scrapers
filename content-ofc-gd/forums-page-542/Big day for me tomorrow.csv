580333,spincast,2011-05-07 00:25:00,3279,Congrats Paul an awesome milestone (much better than millstone) and everyone else who has championed an addiction - It takes a very strong person to beat that. May you live to see many more anniversaries!
580340,BITEME,2011-05-07 00:37:00,1968,Nice Man!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

580369,Kerry,2011-05-07 01:28:00,383,No need to worry about being graphic.Those words could easily help someone else to make the choice Paul.Great milestone! Kerry
580371,rob v,2011-05-07 01:38:00,535,Congrat's not an easy route to take I'm sure... but certainly worth it !!
580430,mercman,2011-05-07 12:21:00,7054," Funny how it works.I started this thread to remind myself where i had come from, and to help me through a rough spot.I had no idea of the impact it would make on some people. I am humbled and grateful.  Paul"
580437,Basskicker,2011-05-07 13:08:00,421,"I haven't posted in while, but this touched me in several ways.  First off, congrats, I just celebrated 9 years in NA and god willing hopefully a few more. I remember back then weighing 95lbs soaking wet, no where to live, no food, no friends, no family....nothing...just a empty walking skeleton of a human being.  Somehow I didn't manage to die or overdose and went to rehab for over 15 months, it was the hardest thing I've ever had to do, but the best thing I have ever done.  Today things are TOTALLY different, got married, friends and family, house, good job and lots of toys, but most of all I have come to find some peace and serenity (from within) which for me is the most important thing.  I never want to go back   P.S.- On a brighter note- It is hard to find fisherman (in the program), so I would really like to meet other recovering people who like to fish.  I would like to extend an open offer to any one who would like to join me for a fishing trip.  Cheers  Jason"
580445,Beans,2011-05-07 14:36:00,3339, Thanks for the AA talk Paul...  Btw...you just blew your anonimity all to ratsh..t !!!   
580446,Beans,2011-05-07 14:47:00,3339, Has it been 6 years already ???...Maribeth and I are amazed that the time has gone by so quickly...  Congratulations...AND...you get better lookin' for it...  It is great to see the guys get sober and well...BUT...The women !...It is like watching a flower bloom...   
580723,Billy Bob,2011-05-08 21:39:00,5865,"Merc,  It takes a BIG MAN with a LOT of courage to post a thread like you just did....and from the looks of it, it has inspired many here in our small fishing internet community. But I'm sure you have touched many others in the last 22 years.  Happy Anniversary,  Bob"
580769,Joey,2011-05-08 23:25:00,9122," Aww shucks Norm  Yep, it has been that long, hard to believe myself!  Looking forward to many more and you were a big help hon - Thank You!!!!!"
580918,Tarzan's Jane,2011-05-09 10:27:00,1183,Wow....what a journey!  I'm surprised....you don't show any signs of having been that broken in your writing skills.   Write a book.  You have talent.  Seriously....write a book - I would buy it.  Congrats....on so many levels - congrats!
580960,bigbuck,2011-05-09 13:45:00,2449,"One step at a time, put one foot in front of the other and keep on trucking. Good for you. I saw what alcoholism does to people as a teenager. It scared the beejeezus outta me. We'd overindulge once in a while but never ever became a daily thing. It literally sucks the life out of you. Now, a couple of drinks is more than enough for this kid, if I never had another drink, it wouldn't bother me at all and that's the way I like it. Hopefully I get to feed my addiction on May 2fer with the boys on our annual fishing getaway by catching a monster pike. I am a fishing addict."
580976,bubbles,2011-05-09 14:16:00,591,Well done to all that struggle with this.
580242,mercman,2011-05-06 19:23:00,7054,"May 6, 1990, i was on my last legs.Swollen, jaundiced and bleeding from places you shouldnt.I was facing life on the street or death.Mom and Dad would have nothing to do with me this time.I had done enough damage in the past, and even though i was thier golden child, i was on my own this time.The woman i was with at the time gave me an ultimatum.Give up the booze or lose everything, again.You see, i had been married before, for 10 years,had a daughter and home, and lost them all. On this day 22 years ago, i made a phone call, and within an hour, 2 people came to my house, helped me dress and started my journey to health. You see, i am an alcholic.Even today, after 22 years of sobriety, i am an alcoholic.They showed that to me at that 1st meeting, and they showed me that i was not alone.They showed me that there was hope at the top of the hole i had dug for myself, and they were willing to walk with me every step of the way, to make sure i made it out safe and sober. I went to 8 meetings a week, for 4 years, and finally the urge to drink left me.Today i am the man that i was born to be. I left the woman i was with shortly after i sobered up.She was not good for my sobriety, and i spent 3 years living on my own doing 8 meetings a week.  In my 3rd year of sobriety, i was attending a special meeting at which someone i had helped get sober, was receiving her 90 day chip.Her cousin came with her for support.She was kinda cute too Sooooooo, tomorrow will be 18 years i am married to this woman She has never seen me drink  but has heard me speak at many meetings, and knows what i was like.She is the lite in my life, and i love here dearly. We got married in the same church that i went to my 1st AA meeting, on the exact day that i got sober.All of the other days were booked already, and this was the only day available.I guess it was meant to be that way. Well, thanks for listening, i just had to share this for anyone interested.  Tite Lines and easy livin  Paul White"
580245,Pikeslayer,2011-05-06 19:29:00,1443,"Paul, No doubt, you are a true inspiration to those who come to know you. I am happy to be one of the inspired. You Rock!!  HAPPY ANNIVERSARY. On both counts.  Regards, Simon"
580247,Terry,2011-05-06 19:35:00,14456,Quitter        LOL   it's not an easy road to sobriety   way to go
580248,splashhopper,2011-05-06 19:49:00,2931,"  And if u get your new boat in the water tomorrow, may the fishing gods be as kind to you as His grace has been in your life thus far odaat"
580249,irishfield,2011-05-06 19:51:00,26272,Sorry Paul.. that's 21 years ago.. but congrats anyhow.

580251,g_clot,2011-05-06 19:56:00,104,"That shows a lot of character and strength.  I'm about to try and quit smoking and will use your story for inspiration.  It takes a lot of man to share that, so thanks for sharing!  Tight lines Paul!"
580252,mercman,2011-05-06 20:04:00,7054,"  Hummm.... 1 day at at time, it seems longer  .Musta blew a few brain cells along the way too. Thanks Wayne"
580253,irishfield,2011-05-06 20:09:00,26272,"Hey crap happens and then ya die, so they say. Keep charging ahead Paul."
580254,Oggie,2011-05-06 20:14:00,588,That's a long tough path but you're here now   so Congratulations! My mom was an alcoholic and she didn't make it! Died at 53.  You're an inspiration to alot of people I'm sure.  Dan O.
580257,fishnsled,2011-05-06 20:19:00,3520,Congrats on both anniversaries!!  :thumbsup_anim: Now go and get that boat slimmed up will ya!!
580259,Joey,2011-05-06 20:39:00,9122,"Congratulatons Paul, that is one big milestone.  I'm on year 6  Joey"
580263,mercman,2011-05-06 20:55:00,7054,"Thanks Joey, and congrats to you too!  Its a hard road, but well worth every step.They say i stopped just in time to save my liver.The blood was from burst vessels in my stomach and throat.In the last 2 years i drank, my stomach would cramp up from trying to expell what i was putting into it, and was litterally coming apart from the strain.Sorry to be so graphic.  "
580264,GBW,2011-05-06 20:59:00,8460,way to go Paul!  I'll have a beer on your behalf.
580269,Handlebarz,2011-05-06 21:21:00,3790,Congratz Paul it must have been a hard long journey you have a lot more strength then most people.
580282,limeyangler,2011-05-06 21:55:00,5204,Congrats x2 Paul. Inspirational.  15 years for me...i think i did mine in monthly instalments as opposed to 1 day at a time....lol.
580291,tb4me,2011-05-06 22:29:00,3295,"Congrats Paul! You are sure an inspiration for us all! I have a good friend that has been battling alcoholism  for many years. We sure wish he could come up with the strength you have shown. Still we stick by his side thru thick n thin. That's what good friends do! Hey we have never met, but id sure like to fish with ya sometime!! Again congrats on your milestone! You deserve a long happy life. I hear ya have a nice new boat! Go get her wet! you deserve it"
580294,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-05-06 22:47:00,0,i knew this was a good day!  i have a fair bit of alcoholism in family as i'm sure many do on OFC and it gives me hope for my friends and family that suffer from that terrible disease.  
580302,mercman,2011-05-06 23:21:00,7054,"Wow. I appreciate all of your well wishes. I am very humbled to say the least. For those of you who think i am strong, let me say this. Strength has nothing at all to do with it.Desire has everything to do with it. Once the shakes go away, and the body begins to heal itself, the insanity begins to lift and it becomes easier to live without medicating yourself with the booze.And NO !!! You dont have to become a jesus freak to get sober either you just have to start believing that you are not the center of the universe, and that whatever is stronger than you will help you stay sober.  I had nothing, i owed everyone.To the point that i wouldnt open my mail box for fear of creditors. Today i have a wife a bussiness, a home, a truck a car a boat and 2 Dogs. Kinda like a country song in reverse  Cheers everyone  Paul"
580303,ehg,2011-05-06 23:32:00,2666,"Someone very close to me is into year 27 of the program. At least alcoholism isn't hereditary. This person is very involved and grateful for their sobriety. Personally when a teen, i found the idea of having the wisdom of knowing the difference between what you can and cannot change to be applicable to all aspects of living.  Congrats to you for this accomplishment!"
580308,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-05-06 23:36:00,1107,Hey Paul I got you a present for your anniversary it will be shipped out on monday   But in all seriousness though good job my Dad was a achoholic the last few years he was alive and it was horrible to see such a GREAT man in that situation it is hard to kick my Dad stopped the day he was told he had cancer but it was already to late for him .
580313,express168,2011-05-06 23:43:00,327,"Good work, we are trying to help my brother who is not doing well with the drink. He recently lost his job after 21 years, he had the problem before but has worsened with some deep depression. You should feel proud of yourself and enjoy the life you have now made for yourself, it is an incredible battle and true strength. P.S. don't forget to honour that lady by your side."
580315,Grimace,2011-05-06 23:48:00,2020,Well done.  I can't wait for your first report with that new boat and old reel. !!
