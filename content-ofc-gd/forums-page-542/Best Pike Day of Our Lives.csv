We covered lot's of shoreline and near the end of the stretch we choose we started to pick up fish...then the entire way back. We landed and caught 10 Pike and I frigged up on one of Ricks and lost it then we had another 4 or 5 good hook ups but they ended short.  Fish 1 Spinnerbait    Fish 2 Spinnerbait   Fish 3 Spinnerbait    Fish 4 Spinnerbait    Fish 5 Spinnerbait    Fish number 6 she hooked up and after a quick battle it let go, Rick threw in the same area with the minnow bait and pulled this pike in, a joined catch!    Fish number 7 jerkbait    Fish number 8 spinnerbait    And the last pike, had to do the mercer shot  spinnerbait fish again   can't get rick's 5th pike to load properly but it was equal in size to our average. My advice on this thread is find flats, fish slow and don’t get stuck on color in the murky water conditions. We did lot’s better than last opener and were prepared, having tight drag to get the hook in then a fast half dozen clicks back on the drag was important to let the fish run around and to have some fun tiring them out for easy landing. A amazing day, My guess for the count was 10 today and Rick’s was 12, wish he was right but no way can I complain! Until tomorrow in a different location off shore this time  And the confident smile of the best pike day of out lives   MTBF Thanks for the reading ladies and gents  Edit* Only added 1 pike to this weekends catch, caught a decent little guy on a spoon today. More to come next weekend"
