Is there a difference between how you charge deep cycle marine batteries, and outboard motor starting marine batteries?  I was told by a marine mechanic that you need to trickle-charge deep cycle batteries, and blast-charge starter batteries...is this true?  If so, where can you buy a battery charger that has settings for both?  Thanks"
580688,Sinker,2011-05-08 18:42:00,8692,"Most decent chargers will have a low amp, and high amp charge rate. Something like 10/2A, or 5/15A settings.  I charge my deepcycles on a 10A charge until about 3/4 way done, then switch it to the trickle charge for the last bit. Starting batts get the full 10A charge till done.  S."
