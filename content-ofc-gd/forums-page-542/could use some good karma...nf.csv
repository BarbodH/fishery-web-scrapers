580610,rickster,2011-05-08 03:16:00,495,Some of you may remember my brother having heart problems 3 years ago that resulted in him having a pacemaker/defibulator put into his chest. He was not feeling well the past while and went in for tests Blood work showed that his kidneys are failing but a Ct scan showed all to be normal. He went for blood work again today to double check and results came back that kidneys are failing. Lost my oldest brother 14 years ago to cancer and I don't think I can handle losing another one. If I have any good karma coming I could sure use it now
