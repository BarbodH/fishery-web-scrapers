580717,mike rousseau,2011-05-08 21:06:00,4661,got out for zone 20 opener friday at midnight with my brother and a friend of mine...  and the fish did not dissapoint us... we managed 13 walleye between 2 and 5 pounds in 2 hours... kept 12... we did a count on the last fish and realized he would have made it 13... so back he went.. and all the fish were caught trolling cranks and they were crushing the baits and fighting like champs!  however while cleaning them i was surprised to find that 2 of the fish were still full of eggs... ive never seen eggs in walleye in may before in my life... how about you guys??  anyways...heres that nights catch

580726,Roy,2011-05-08 21:45:00,13728,"Congrats! It's a late spring, lots will still be egg laden."
580737,mike rousseau,2011-05-08 22:01:00,4661, i thought it was a belly full of gobies or perch... they were some of the smaller fish we caught too...  if it was a biggun with a bloated belly i would have released it assuming it was eggs but these fish were only 2-3lbs  water is only 47-50 degrees in the LARRY right now...
580741,Billy Bob,2011-05-08 22:11:00,5865,VERY nice catch and a good way to start off the season....I'm guessing night trolling or am I wrong...
