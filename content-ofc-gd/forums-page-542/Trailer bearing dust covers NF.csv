580487,misfish,2011-05-07 20:01:00,29133,You mean those rubber covers? You have to put them on and lift an edge to let the air out.This is what I find works for me.
580510,stasbrute,2011-05-07 21:42:00,206,"Thankyou for thr reply Misfish, I was talking about the metal kind, I saw the rubber ones at the Crappy Tire, maybe I will try those. The trailer originally came with metal ones so thats what I purchased. Do the rubber ones stay put?? are they interchangable??"
580514,misfish,2011-05-07 21:51:00,29133,"You mentioned dust covers,which to me, is the rubber covers which mostly are used to cover up bearing buddies.You are talking about the bearing/wheelhub cap.  Im thinking you got the wrong size."
580528,stasbrute,2011-05-07 22:59:00,206,"Yes I guess I mean the caps for the wheel hub, not bearing buddies, just having a hard time getting to stay put."
580530,misfish,2011-05-07 23:08:00,29133,Wrong sized cap bought Grog.
580540,workwear,2011-05-07 23:43:00,592,you might wanna seal them with a bead of silicone.....when its time to service them grab a blade to break the seal....
580566,mikdor,2011-05-08 01:12:00,109,Mayby you have to much grease in the hub.Just a thought. mikdor
580568,Roy,2011-05-08 01:13:00,13728,"Maybe I'm not reading this right but if the cap is going on partly then popping off, I don't think you have the incorrect size. there's too much difference from one size to another ie. 1.78"", 1.98"", 2.00"", 2.33"". OK the 1.98 and the 2.00 are fairly close. I think that it might be the way that you're trying to put it on. If you held the cap centered to the hub and tapped lightly all around until it completly seated...tap through the piece of wood if you must. If worse comes to worst, they're only about $3 a pair. Go out and buy the two closest sizes to what you need."
580595,Bigfisherman,2011-05-08 02:29:00,100,"Same thing happened to me last year, I had to stop and tap it 3 times then it stayed on? I check them once in a awhile, not sure why they are the correct size. If they keep coming off try another one? and carry an extra just incase it does come off....."
580827,irishfield,2011-05-09 01:22:00,26272,"Throw them in the freezer for the night, to shrink them, and run out in the morning and push them on by hand..."
