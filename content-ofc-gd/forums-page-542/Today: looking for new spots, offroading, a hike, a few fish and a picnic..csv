580838,Rod Caster,2011-05-09 01:32:00,5784,"I mapped out a few back-road brookie lakes yesterday and without a GPS me and my gf drove up some ""trees-closing-in-on-you"" trails. It turned out be a series of unfortunate events. My truck is scratched to bits, I blew a tire and my lure caught on a tree as I was driving...completely spooled me. We never made it to any lakes so we turned around and came back home.  Today, we returned, better prepared. Since my truck was already scratched, I now had nothing left to lose. We parked about one kilometer before the lake and walked the rest of the way. Turns out I could have driven in, but the walk was nice.  It was a beautiful, small lake, with fallen trees and marsh all along the banks. With some clever tactics I found a few casting spots and managed to get.....     perch.      There were many perch along the whole shorline and some were fair-sized. After I realized that I would only catch perch  we just carried on with the hike and had a nice lunch.    We were out for nearly 5 hours. On the way back we stopped at a stocked lake and caught one brookie and a few perch. Just a little guy, so I let him live.    Now I'm tired, make that completely bushed, so it's off to bed soon and I'm hoping for some superior steelhead in the next few days as I travel that way for work."

581251,Mike01,2011-05-10 02:42:00,378,I was out in Chisholm last week.  Saw a couple of fish but I started to rain pretty hard so we called it a day.
