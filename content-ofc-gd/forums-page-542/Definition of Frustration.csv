The first spot (The Yellowknife River) opened up nicely this week and we were going to see if we could get smoe whities, grayling or pike to cooperate, but they wouldn't. We saw a couple of fish swirl on the surface but no takers.  We decided that since the river had popped nicely that another current area back in the bush aways on a different lake may have the eyes up and aboot. We drove to the trail head donned our waders and grabbed our gear and off into the woods we go. The trail is well marked and runs though stands of birch, pine and spruce as well as some lowland wetland areas plus there are a few large granite Canadian Shield hills to scale and decend before we arrive at our destination an hour later. The trail was mostly hard packed ice and snow with numerous bare patches and some deeper snow in areas to just above the knees in depth.  Well we were too early the river mouth is still frozen!!!     :wallbash: It will be open by next weekend though so we should be able to get into bunches of eyes.  OH, and no pictures either as I brought the camera but forgot the battery in the charger back home."
581009,Rod Caster,2011-05-09 15:45:00,5784,That's still less frustrating than finding hoards of people or tons of litter at your favorite spot.  I can't wait to see your first spring report... although it will probably frustrate me a bit; North Bay isn't far enough north. haha. Cheers.
581011,Joey,2011-05-09 15:49:00,9122,Think of the exercise and fresh air you got
581017,johnnyb,2011-05-09 15:59:00,3413,Yep...took a nice walk through the woods last weekend....lake wasn't frozen but I don't think there's any fish in it  All I got was exercise
581023,Guest gbfisher,2011-05-09 16:09:00,0,"Gee...that's gotta suck living in the land""o""fish....   I guess that's why they call it ""fishing"" instead of ""catching"".   sorry bad joke."
581025,solopaddler,2011-05-09 16:19:00,8605,"Make sure you bring batteries in two weeks.  Just talked to someone in Nakina, ice is mostly all gone. Couple more days and it'll be totally gone."
581030,DRIFTER_016,2011-05-09 16:36:00,10439," Check, bring batteries, got it. I hadn't planned on doing any fishing before the trip East and just grabbed the camera out of the case that was already set for Pikapalooza 2011."
581155,splashhopper,2011-05-09 22:11:00,2931,I can't wait to see the pics of your neck of the woods.
581160,danc,2011-05-09 22:50:00,4677,I thought you used a thing called the internet to see if the ice is out for your destinations Dave??
581161,DRIFTER_016,2011-05-09 22:52:00,10439," Only those Southern destinations as up here in the ""Real North"" we don't have the interweb.  :tease:"
581162,danc,2011-05-09 22:58:00,4677,Have fun on your Pike adventure Dave. Looking forward to the reports already.
