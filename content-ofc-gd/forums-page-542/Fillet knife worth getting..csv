So I watch a video on YouTube of Darryl Choronzey watching another guy(Russel Mckay) fillet Walleye and the guy was amazing at it and he recommended Rapala fillet knives. I went and I got one at Crappy Tire and just used it today on a few decent sized perch and WOW, what a difference it makes. It came with a very good ceramic sharpener and it just beats the berkley knife hands down.  So if you looking for a good fillet knife that isn't expensive, think about getting a Rapala fillet knife. I got the 6"" for 16$ and its very worth looking into. I'm pretty new to filleting fish and that video and the knife help allot.  Walleye Video: Pike Video:"

580755,Roy,2011-05-08 22:37:00,13728,Perch are one of the worst fish for knives. Usually have to smooth the edge after every few fish if you want a clean cut.
580763,dhickey,2011-05-08 22:52:00,1038,YEP. I have the knife that my Dad tought me how to clean fish with(RAPALA)35yrs ago works like a charm easy to sharpen(all I see is bones when I use it.)
580767,bigugli,2011-05-08 23:13:00,6138,I still have the Rapala knife my Gram bought for me in the old country over 40 years back. The blade is getting a bit thin and the sheath is dark with age and abuse but I love it. Perch are brutal on a blade. Constantly need to resharpen.
