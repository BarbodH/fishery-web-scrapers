"
580457,mercman,2011-05-07 16:11:00,7054,"If she's happy, why rock the boat Is she truly happy? If so, then you should be a happy camper, because a happy wife means a happy familly life.So RENOVATE where you are and make it like a new place. IMHO   Paul"
580459,johnny13,2011-05-07 16:18:00,38,if your wife would promise you something at marriage wouldn't you want her to stick to it? and what if you dont have money to renovate. its not like you can renovate this town to look like where i wanna be. what if your son was on the other side of this country and you want to be with him.
580461,Teressa,2011-05-07 16:27:00,55,"First of all, find out why she doesn't want to move. Discuss with her why you do want to move. Try to compromise if possible."

580485,grt1,2011-05-07 19:54:00,638,"I'm kinda in the same boat. We live outside Red Lake, on the lake in a house we built in 1990. To me it's our little piece of paradise but to her, it's the bush and she's sick of living in the bush and want to move to the city. I'm ok with that if I can be near water and have fishing close by, She wants to go to Winnipeg, I would prefer Kenora.  Everytime something goes wrong health wise she says, "" I hate this place, I don't want to live here anymore""  We are at a stalemate right now so it looks like i'm going to have another summer of good fishing but I'm not looking forward to the winter months and her complaining, maybe next year will be the time to move somewhere.  One thing for sure, If she isn't happy, I won't be either (she'll see to that)"
580488,Mike Pike,2011-05-07 20:02:00,1332,"So, what your saying is your wife wanted something and she got her way.  What's the issue?  This sounds completely normal to me."

580504,Joey,2011-05-07 21:12:00,9122," From the tone of your post, I agree with this statement.  Marriage is about compromise and making each other happy.  Doesn't seem to be working that way.  Sorry."

581095,jimmer,2011-05-09 19:42:00,2730,"Man am I lucky. My wonderful wife pushed me to make the move I always wanted to do, but was always worried about. We have now lived on a lake for 26 years, have some trees around us and still close enough to a couple of larger centers yet far enough away from other family members.lol Talk to her and start looking at places where you want to live, show her pictures and houses and it might grow on her. Approach it as positive as possible and avoid arguing if you can. Like others have said, you only live once, so make it good and enjoy it while you're here! Life's about tough choices sometimes."
