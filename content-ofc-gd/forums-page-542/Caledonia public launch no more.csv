I would ask anyone intrested in restoring a public park and launch back to the people to also write a note expressing your dissapointment.    I was very disappointed this morning when I went to enjoy one of our public natural resources and found that I was unable to access the public boat launch on River Road. There was a locked gate preventing access, however another three individuals were there using the boat ramp, and they indicated to me that I was unable to use it as I did not have a key. The individuals in question were associated with Don Hyde marine located in Hagarsville. Two were potential clients test driving a boat, the other was a sales representative, who was allowing them to take a test drive. Why is public access blocked? I have enjoyed the use of that ramp for a number of years and as a member of the public feel that I have the right to access it as well. It should not be for a privileged few. Due to this situation, I then proceeded to spend my recreational dollars elsewhere. I will continue to do so as long as this situation exists. A typical fishing outing results in $25 - $100 of economic activity, do you wish to drive that economic activity out of your town? I find it ironic that there is a large sign asking the public to vote for Caledonia as Canada's fishing town, yet you have chosen to block public access to a public park built with public money. It is my request that this situation be changed immediately. Kind regards"
580552,johndox,2011-05-08 00:23:00,54,Ive lived in or around  Caledonia all my life and dont ever remember there being a public boat ramp. If you are refering to the one I am thinking of I think it is part of Lafortune park and likely belongs to the grand river conservation and as long as the park was open it was private but i think the gate has just been left open the last few years making it free. But yes it sucks that the only other place is next door where you have to pay. Come to Cayuga we have a public boat ramp here and the fishing is great.
