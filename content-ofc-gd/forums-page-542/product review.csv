581052,archer379,2011-05-09 17:35:00,277,we had one on the boat this weekend at the bay of quinte this thing is great
581272,grt1,2011-05-10 03:44:00,638,"i put one on my boat 2 weeks before I pulled it in the fall, I loved what it could do. the anchor program is very impressive. but withonly a couple weeks of trying it I didn't get to fully play with it. I'm picking up a couple new batteries to use with it (my old batteries are pretty well at the end of their working lives) and can't wait to use it again.  I think it makes all other versions of the electric trolling motor obsolete."
