Your right, Carp especially are fished for heavily in Europe as well as the Cats where as over here its totally the reverse.

I've been looking around over the weekend and took a look at the Grand River, found it very shallow and for the most part only good for fly fishing, also took a look at Lake Guelph which seems very promising, deep water close in so hopefully might get some fishing in there over the next few weeks if I can find out if it's worth it.  Colin."

Being a fellow resident, I can tell you that there many good lakes within a couple of hours drive or less offering a wide variety of species. There is good action in both the soft water and hard water seasons on Lake Simcoe which is less than an hour from you.  Shoot me a PM if you want more details.  Tony"

Easiest way to start fishing around here is to get a cheap, medium spinning rod put some 8  lb mono on it, a simple sinker, hook with a worm and throw it out there. There is a excellent variety of fish most lakes or river that will hit that worm."

I'm looking forward to getting as much help as I can as well as going out and searching for myself, to be honest distance doesn't bother me with regards to fishing and I feel that you only get out what you put in and if that means travelling long distances then I really don't mind.  I took a drive up to Georgian Bay the other weekend and was overawed by the immense size of some of the waters up there, watercraft is certainly going to play a big part in finding the fish.

580342,Colin Marshall,2011-05-07 00:39:00,66," Hi,  Nice to meet you and thanks for the kind welcome.  Regarding the catfish, once the first few heavy runs are over it's just a matter of coaxing them in gently with lots of heavy head thumps, the first few runs are amazing and its just a matter of hanging on while they empty the spool of line.....all heart thumping action.  Looking forward to wetting a line soon over here.  Colin."
580346,Colin Marshall,2011-05-07 00:42:00,66," Hi,  Great to meet you and many thanks for the warm welcome.  Thanks for the advice, I took a drive up to Lake Simcoe the other weekend and was overawed by the immense size of the water, its certainly going to be a challenge to find where the fish are, but watercraft is as important as the fishing itself, so looking forward to it.  I'm not looking specifically for Carp, I'm looking to catch my first Large or Smallmouth Bass as well as Salmon and Steelhead.  Hope to speak again very soon.  Colin."

579676,Colin Marshall,2011-05-05 00:57:00,66,"Hi Everyone,   I've just joined this forum site and must say the initial impression is very good, lots of people willing to help other fellow fishermen on venues, topics and tactics.  I'm new to Canada, living in the Vaughan area of Woodbridge, I've fished mainly in Europe in the large English, French and Spanish rivers and lakes with captures including Catfish to 136 lbs and Carp to 52 lbs, although I get just as much fun getting my string pulled by Pike, Walleye, Bass and anything else that swims by.  To me fishing is a great pleasure just by being by the water and catching something is a bonus. I don't mind travelling long distances to fish, but to start with any information on waters close to home that might put a bend in my rod would be much appreciated.  Likewise I'm more than willing to pass on any information or tips on tackle and methods to anyone intending to fish over in Europe.  Tight lines to you all and hope to speak again soon.  Colin.  "

Lake Simcoe is virtually an inland great lake and has all kinds of opportunities. This amazing body of water is just up the 400 Highway from you. As mentioned already, if it is Carp you are interested in, the experts will be along shortly to give you specific info.  There are lots of good rivers and streams as well.  Enjoy your time on the board!"

It's funny how carp and cats are the primary target over there while pike, walleye and bass are secondary. Quite the opposite here. You should have no problem finding good carp fishing or fishing in general in your area. Best of luck"

579779,Michael_Brown,2011-05-05 03:55:00,411,"Hi Catfish:  Welcome to the site.  You will find that you have moved into fishing paradise. We are surrounded by amazing fisheries and there are hundreds of lakes all within a 2 hour drive of you. To the north of you is Lake Simcoe which is a big waterbody that holds some great fish. East will land you in the Kawartha's with numerous productive lakes. Try Rice Lake for great numbers of multiple species, including non-stop carp action if your interested. Pigeon, Chemong, Scugog, Balsam, etc. We tend to get spoiled living here and forget all the great fishing we have right at our doorstep. If you want to try for some trout and salmon, the numerous creeks and rivers that enter Lake Ontario are nearby and easy to fish. Niagra Falls isn't just for looking at it offers dynamite fishing in the area.  If you like big rivers, check out the St. Lawerence east of Kingston, lots of action and area to fish.   Have fun but keep us posted around here because most of us like hearing about and sharing good fishing."

579815,Mike01,2011-05-05 12:29:00,378,"If you get the opportunity, take a little drive up to North Bay.  Lake Nipissing has some excellent fishing for almost anything that swims(except trout).  It's only a 3.5 hour drive from you and there are numerous places to stay.  Most of the lodges and cottages up here include a boat rental but you will need to get a pleasure craft operators card.  There are several OFC members up this way so i doubt you'd have a problem finding a fishing buddy"
