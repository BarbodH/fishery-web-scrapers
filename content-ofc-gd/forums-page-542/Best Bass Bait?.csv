580889,Lunatic,2011-05-09 03:15:00,536,"Spro frogs work best for me,and i just love using them. last year i started to use whacky style more often and worked out great for me.i had a thread here last year asking everyones opinions on colour and i think bubblegum pink was most popular choice,so i purchased a pack and they worked great. baby bass colour worked good too. i have terrible luck with spinnerbaits!  its probably me. and buzzbaits,i love using them but have never caught anything on them!! ive tried everything with them,just can get any fish to go for it lol"
580895,Banger68,2011-05-09 03:28:00,157,"By far most of my Bass have been on 6"" Zoom Lizard in Junebug. Even a bunch of Smallmouth by the cottage."
580983,eman,2011-05-09 14:23:00,101,"Big-O - chrome/black. Confidence bait, always first lure at a new spot (minus the weeds). Catches #s and usually biggest fish of the season. Great multi-species lure too (pike, walleye & big perch & crappie) 7"" Berkely powerworm (texas rigged) - A close second place. Will use over a Big-O if I'm in weeds, or if the bite is slow (colours: natural, black w/ red, blue or chartruese tail) Blue fox - in-line spinner (#2,#3 - silver-blue). Will often use in a new lake to catch multispecies and see whats biting."
580989,Handlebarz,2011-05-09 14:41:00,3790,baby 1 fire tiger or cray fish. lazer eye spinner bait either chartreuse or white. good ol rubber worm texas rigged purple or black with red or chartreuse tail

580174,GBW,2011-05-06 14:32:00,8460,"now I remember...  a whacky rigged 5"" pink stick worm.  a fish pulled the rod right out of my son's hands and into the lake with that set up."
580179,manitoubass2,2011-05-06 14:46:00,11391," lol, I have one of those. On Rainy river at least, it hasn't produced one fish, lol. I always wondered why though, the action looks awesome to me anyways. But If I take it off and toss a live target frog/similar frogs, bam! right away.  Now that dam spinner is for the kids cause they still think its fun to use, and if it doesn't snag, thats good for daddy too!  My favorite bass baits...  Rapala DT 10 minnow pattern Rapala Flat rap Firetiger (deadly for pike as well) Jig n' pig 6"" salted Yum worms, black silver fleck, texas rigged or wacky style on a 3/8 oz. black jig Black and silver slated Yum grubs on 3/8 oz black or pink jig"
580181,OhioFisherman,2011-05-06 14:59:00,6623,"What Roy said, but probably a lot more fish on a 6 inch plastic worm since the early 70`s than anything else. A lot of fish on a lot of different lures, but I almost always had a rod rigged with a worm. Favorite would be a 6 inch Zoom u tail in Junebug.  Er... for smallies? tubes."
580182,lhousesoccer,2011-05-06 15:06:00,442, No it's not. It's about the eating.  That's the only reason anyone would want to spend time and money dragging in those water-logged wet socks.
580194,manitoubass2,2011-05-06 16:10:00,11391,"lol, a 10lb walleye is 60ft of water puts up a great fight, what are you guys talking about? Especially on light line"
580195,Harrison,2011-05-06 16:13:00,2202,"Roy is bang on as usual.  Way to many variables to give one certain lure.  Picture it like this.. you have to be sure to get whatever bait they want in the fishes face.  And for the right amount of time.  If you go to a country line dancing bar to meet a fine lady wearing your popped Polo lime green golf shirt and skin tight khaki pants with sperry topsiders and doing your best MC hammer on the dance floor... well, you may not get bit.  However, switch to other certain locales with the same getup, you'd probably have a good chance.  If I had to pick one.. ole' Pig and Jig."
580236,Garry2Rs,2011-05-06 18:56:00,1425,"There are lots of great Bass lures.  Many have been listed here already.  My personal favourite in the early season is a plastic toad/frog.  However I will bet that more bass are caught on plastic worms than all other baits combined!  If I have to produce fish, day-in-day-out a 5"" plastic worm is what I want.  You can fish it weightless, Texas rig it, drag it on a jig shaky style, cast or bounce or drag and swim it weighted Carolina style, nose hook it and fish it over the weeds and slop, hook it wacky under a bobber, put it on a worm harness and cast or troll it...etc. etc. etc."
580241,craigdritchie,2011-05-06 19:21:00,1586,"Most effective bait? Re-read what Roy said.  Most fun is another matter. For me, that's anything on the surface. For smallmouth, that would be a Heddon Tiny Torpedo. For buckets, probably a buzzbait."
580268,Toddyc20,2011-05-06 21:13:00,141,My favourite bait to use is a 1/2oz Netbait Paca jig with a Yum Chunk trailer.  I had more fun using this bait last year than any other bait I own.

580505,ehg,2011-05-07 21:17:00,2666,     There is so much that is effective according to conditions. As Mr. Ritchie says i too am stuck on topwaters most of the season. The Heddon Spittin Image specifically is my favourite topwater by far. The frog Jitterbug and small Zara Spooks have also been good.

580638,Fishnwire,2011-05-08 11:40:00,983,"I love top water baits for SMB...that surface smash always gets my heart racing like nothing else.  My ""go to"" is a Zara spook or a similar walking style bait by Excalibur that I believe is called a ""Sammy""...most walkers are good so I'm eager to try out the Live Target frogs I just got.  Bring on the last week end in June!!!!!"
580054,LegitFish,2011-05-06 02:06:00,69,"What's your number one bass bait?  My LiveTarget Yellow Perch lure has been the best I have lure I have ever owned. It seems to work even on bad days. Not only does it catch Bass, but Ive caught Pike, Catfish, and even Walleye. These lures are great!"
580058,cwpowell,2011-05-06 02:17:00,265,Recently bought a couple live target lures. But my go to is a white tube jig or a pink senko. I also love the rapala j-9's i have one in a discontinued colour that works for me everytime!
580067,kenzy31,2011-05-06 02:34:00,261,for the last 3 seasons it's been a Zarra Super Spook in Baby Bass pattern.  nothing beats that topwater strike
580070,Grimace,2011-05-06 02:41:00,2020,Scum frog with the little paddle legs.  Almost like a slow motion buzz bait.  I love watching the bass crush it.
580072,GBW,2011-05-06 02:46:00,8460,I forget what Bass look like as I want Walleye and Musky.  I found bass and a shakey head jig with a 'senko' type bait is best for those pesty buggers.

580131,Roy,2011-05-06 12:16:00,13728,"You can't really name any specific bait without knowing the type of bass, time of the year, weather conditions, water temp., water clarity, calm or choppy. For example, a surface bait might be your best bait but I doubt very much that it would be your go to if you were on a windswept lake over 40 FOW. As long as the bait's action is good, almost any surface bait will produce over calm, shallower, weedy water. Tubes and critters in weed pockets. Cranks and tubes over rocks. etc... Well at least that's my opinion."
