580465,Keenan,2011-05-07 17:44:00,59,"I am Redoing my boat and trailer the winch had some rope on it from the last guy that owned it, it's all frayed looking for suggestions on what to use. Should I put rope back on or try something like thin air craft cable? The boat is only a 14ft alum. with a 20 hp 4 stroke. Thank. Adam."
580472,BillM,2011-05-07 18:24:00,17367,What's wrong with the seat belt material that I've seen on almost every trailer?
580481,Cast-Away,2011-05-07 19:32:00,790,Adam I bought a new winch from BPS last year and it came with a seatbelt type od material which was what I had on the old one. It works great with my 2000# boat.

580674,Billy Bob,2011-05-08 16:06:00,5865,"I have the seat belt material on my electric winch that my wife and boys bought me a couple years ago for fathers day...DON'T like it but it does work....You have to be careful that it doesn't twist while it's be wound in....and it ALWAYS does..  When I had my hand winch I found the rock climbing rope was the BEST you could get but a little pricey compared to other ropes....it does NOT stretch or rot and is VERY VERY strong for it's diameter....  So it really depends on what you like, want to put up with and how much you want to spend.  Bob"
