580669,glen,2011-05-08 15:12:00,2641,I am doing a fishing trip up north with my brother    and he needs to check 100 or so emails a day. Can we rent a satellite phone for the week we need it? Can Satellite phones be used to check email? If so where could i get a Satellite phone near Barrie?  The only other way i can think of is if we use On star in my car.  But we would have to take two cars then.  Thanks for any help.

580678,otter649,2011-05-08 16:29:00,118,Radioworld rents out satellite phones & other electronics but should call in advance to reserve for the week you will need it......
580679,glen,2011-05-08 16:30:00,2641,Thanks GB. We need it for a week and about 5-8hrs total.  Would that be more then $400?  Would i be able to rent one in Barrie?
580680,glen,2011-05-08 16:31:00,2641,Thanks otter i will call them.
