The basic idea is to take a veteran fishing as a simple and genuine way of thanking these fine folks for putting their lives on the line so that we can all live (and fish) in safety and peace.  The first annual Host A Veteran Fishing Derby aims to raise money for injured soldiers and their families through Military Family Support Centres. You can read some details by clicking here, or click here to go to the event website and register.  If you don't live near Lake Ontario, and it's too far to come, then no worries - you can still take a veteran fishing anywhere. There is more info on the website.  I think this is a wonderful idea, and I hope people will support it and make it hugely successful. These folks are true heroes, and we can never thank them enough."

This is an excellent event to support, and I will be sure to mention it to my other fishing buddies to get involved if they can.  Tony"

580762,Mike01,2011-05-08 22:52:00,378,I think this is a great idea.  I wonder if something could be organized up here on Nipissing seeing as we have an airforce base here as well as a lot of ww2 vet's.
