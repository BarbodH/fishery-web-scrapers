Now dont get me wrong its not that i didnt like fishing, its just the fact I never had time as I was training to make the NBA D-League. I never made the league because of injuries and now I have a completely torn ACL. Consequently I now have time to fish again.  I tried using my old account to sign back in but I cant remember what i was called or what my password was. An update on me since i was last on here:  -Coached rep Basketball the last 2 years -I tried out for the NBA D-League -Tore my ACL in January -Arthroscopic Knee surgery in February -In need of ACL reconstruction -Started my own company called Al's Basketball training -I now have an amazing girlfriend who loves to fish   AL"

580643,Grimace,2011-05-08 11:50:00,2020,Sorry to hear about your ACL.   What you have lost to injuries I am sure you have gained in character.  Adversity builds character.
