580366,dannyboy,2011-05-07 01:20:00,367,"20' or 40' container, how much weight? Do you need an Export C of A?  Dan"
580367,Terry,2011-05-07 01:21:00,14456, you sold one of the Yogos???
580372,irishfield,2011-05-07 01:41:00,26272,  I was looking for the picture.. can't find it. Was gonna ask you if you wanted to go with it and how much food you thought I should pack.. oh and did you want the portapotty?
580373,irishfield,2011-05-07 01:43:00,26272,"  20'... weight is minimal in comparison to container weight.. 700 lbs MAX. Insured for $50,000 in case the cargo ship goes down! Export C of A will be his problem.. I don't even think he can do it with a homebuilt coming into UK."
580427,dannyboy,2011-05-07 11:58:00,367,"A 20' sea can would be about $8k USD port to port, customs $500. VAT and duty additional.  Dan"
580442,irishfield,2011-05-07 13:33:00,26272,"Thanks about what I figured and what I originally told the guy in the UK (so he could give it some thought).. plus they charged me a $1000 to bring the container up to Penetang, from the TO train yard, and a $1000 to pick it back up again last time."
