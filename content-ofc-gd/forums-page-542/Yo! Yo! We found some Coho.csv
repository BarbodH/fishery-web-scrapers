Been itching to get out on the open water, but, haven't even got my boat out of storage yet (next week for sure!!!!).  Received an invitation from one of my fishing buds, and fellow board member, Spincast.  Juli and I jumped at the chance to hit Lake O in search of salmonids. We hit the road bright (dark) and early, got to Rick's, transferred our gear...then hit the open road.  We were on the water, with the first rod out shortly after daybreak.  The cast and crew  Spincast    Myself and Juli, smiling faces all around       We had some time to chat, and, trade a few stories before the first fish hit.  We had decided Rick would be up first, he was overdue to have some fun with some chrome.  After a nice battle, a scrappy 22""er was landed...quick photos and measurement, back it went.  We must have still been half asleep, we had misidentified it as a bow, after the rest of the morning...and checking the photos, turns out it was a nice coho.    Juli was up next, and, she made us wait...and wait........and wait some more      We had lunch, and, right after the fish turned on with a flurry!  First rod jumped, we missed it...less than a minute later, the rigger rod went, by the time Juli got to it, the fish had been dancing on top and shook free, arrgh!  Another minute passed and a third rod went off!!  This one was on for good...almost a triple header, which would have been interesting.    18"" coho, not large, but, Juli's new PB    Before we could get the two rods back in the water, my lead core, planer set up went off.  Scrappy battle, and, my Lyman hunch had paid off.    21 1/2"" male coho    What a great flurry of action, Rick in his ""glitter pants"", lol!!  Coho scales everywhere!    We were starting to run out of time, but, decided to make one more short pass back over the area where we had success.  Trolled down, nothing, as soon as I began the turn...bang...fish on, Rick's second coho, a scrappy 17"".       Trolled for a brief time after that, then packed up, and headed for port.  Great times, laughs (especially the infomercial moment, where we were persuading the fish to bite, had to be there) and company.  Thanks for an awesome morning/early afternoon on the water, buddy!!!  One last photo, fresh coho on the bbq (Juli's 18"")    Off to a kid's only fishing day tomorrow morning, then work in the afternoon.  Happy Mother's Day to all the ladies on the forum!!!"
