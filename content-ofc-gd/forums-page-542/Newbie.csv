580971,eman,2011-05-09 14:13:00,101,"hi,  I've read some great discussions on this board for the last few months and thought I would join. I have been fishing since I was kid and the passion seems to be growing the last few years. I'm looking forward to reading and contributing on this site. I live in Toronto and fish mostly for bass, pike, and walleye if I can find them, mostly Southern Ontario and whenever I can escape to the great white north. Still learning the site, so bare with me as I haven't figured out how to setup my profile.  Cheers,"
