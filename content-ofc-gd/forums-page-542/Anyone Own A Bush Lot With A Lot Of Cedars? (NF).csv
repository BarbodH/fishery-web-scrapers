579957,DanD,2011-05-05 20:00:00,2223,I’m really sorry Mike I didn’t mean to insult you in any way; it was meant as a heads up if you were to get pulled over and checked. I don’t even know if it would be an issue? It’s just that I do maintenance repairs to a number of the CFIA’s  fleet vehicles and we (an inspector and myself) got talking about how they were going to step up enforcement on transporting wood & trees too and from restricted areas. Believe me I have to much respect for you; to throw any crap your way. I still remember you trying to help organize a trip up to Eddy’s camp for my brother that has cancer; you went out of your way. We haven’t given up hope on going; but we also haven’t been given the green like by the doctor.  Sorry again Mike.  Dan.
579959,dave524,2011-05-05 20:12:00,4508,"Solo, there is a lot of concern recently about transporting plant material, the bulk of the concern centres around the Emerald Ash Borer. the main culprit in the transport of this invasive and deadly  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerald_ash_borer  species is firewood and hardwood pallettes from diseased stock. There are some bans on bringing your own firewood in Prov. Parks I believe. I would think you can bring some cedars south with a clear conscience, goin north with stock could conceiveably cause some concern. Forestry Grad Class of 74, UofT."

I went early to avoid the lineups first in line yippeeee ""how many bags sir"" 5 please and where do you live across the street  . . . no can do, can't transport out of the area  :wallbash:  I go on my way come back three hours later and everyone in my area has fresh mulch around their trees – so the rules went out the window when it got busy. So much for protecting the environment! And probably didn't want to load it back into the trucks."

How much do you usually tip a cow in your neck of the woods?  Up here it's usually 20% if they give up the good milk.
579274,aplumma,2011-05-04 01:00:00,6896,It kind of depends on how steep the hill is and whether it is uphill or down. I found the 2 handed over the shoulder push is the best if they are under 1000 lbs. If they are over that then it is best to double team them going to the downhill side.   Art

That’s just to make sure there are not restrictions on the transport of wild (non nursery grown) trees from whatever area you find them into your area. Don’t ask me why the CFIA is the organization that’s looking after the invasive insect problem (emerald ash bore, asian long-horned beetle along with other insects) but they are the ones setting up the restrictions and in-charge of enforcement; I guess the fines are pretty heavy. Maybe there’s nothing to this and just a thought on my part; but it wouldn’t hurt to check? Cheap trees plus big fine maybe isn’t so cheap? Dan."

579885,mercman,2011-05-05 16:32:00,7054,"What Dan said. I did a bit of research earlier, and there are other cedar based diseases that have been decimating wild and nursery grown cedars throughout canada, not to mention diseases that affect other species that can be transported in the soil around the roots. I am sure however, that your expertise in this field means that you have done or will do the proper research on the areas where the trees will be reomoved"
579889,Billy Bob,2011-05-05 16:43:00,5865, LOL...  Good one Roy...
579938,solopaddler,2011-05-05 19:05:00,8605,"Okay I'm going to reply to this.  It boggles my mind how some people always feel the need to express their opinion especially when it's pointless.  Their is absolutely no way no how I'd be transporting invasive species from wild trees from a bush lot up north. Of course their is a remote possibility. There's also a remote possibility that I'll win the lottery and get struck by lightning.  What makes you think nursery stock is ""safer"" than wild stock from the bush?  If anything nursery stock is exposed to more possible invasive species.  Do you guys realize that half our nurseries sell stock that's not even grown here?  It's coming from warmer climates south of the border.  I'll gladly take the ""chance"" that my wild stock will be safe.  And why exactly would I want to contact some half baked government agency for their permission? Seriously.  Come tax time next year I think I'll contact the IRS so they can scrutinize me more closely. Heaven forbid I do anything that might be construed as illegal.  I've said it before. If some of you guys have nothing worthwhile to add you should keep your opinion opinion to yourself and think twice before you click the reply button.
