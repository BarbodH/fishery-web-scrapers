Hit binbrook today for a couple of hours with no more than cold feet, hands and faces, and a couple of little perch to show for it.. wind was awful an there were whiteout conditions... Maybe I will have better luck next time... Unfortunatley the others had the same luck... and several in nice cozy huts did not even get a single bite, so I guess we can be thankful we didn't get skunked. What we did catch was on maggots on little jigs or minnows on little jigs."
