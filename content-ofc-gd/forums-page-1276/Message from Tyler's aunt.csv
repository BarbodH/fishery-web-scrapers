She is offering up her commision on any book orders recieved in the month of February to Tylers fundraising.

There is a great book called ""Starting Fishing"" which has TONS of information in it for the young fisherperson! I just got one in my shipment. There are also tons of great titles on nature and wildlife, geography well you know, tons of great stuff! If they get their order to me on or before February 16, I can bring the order to the Fishing Derby on Feb 24.  Here is the website for the books, http://www.usborne.ca/ , there really is some good stuff in there, and the books are a very high quality.  Take a look and let me know if there's anything you might be interested in.  Here's the description of the ""Starting Fishing"" book A practical guide for young anglers.
