Anyone need some wind in their area - give me a call  -  seems every time I go fishing - there is WIND!!! - it is like it just loves to be around me.  I have gone to Florida, South Carolina, Quebec, Jacks lake, pulled the boat everywhere - the forcast calls for calm and nice - I get there and the winds come from no where - !!!  Was just too cold and windy to work it - so we will be back out next week -  Hopefully we will get to prove out Big Boyz II from Simcoe bait and tackle - thanks Lou  May get a tite line next week - barring any more wind!!!

30494,Carp,2007-02-03 21:48:00,1488,The weather report was calling for some winds yesterday and today. Too bad it was enough to put a damper on your fishing.  You'll get into some fish soon enough.  Keep the reports coming. .....and don't forget we like pics.

I look back and I think I should have kept some perch but I don't like to keep fish!  Next time it will be good for you I hope"
