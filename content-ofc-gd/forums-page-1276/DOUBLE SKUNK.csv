30460,Beans,2007-02-03 20:43:00,3339,Ah well...Keep the faith my son...it happens sometimes...believe me...  I went 0 for 6 trips icefishing a couple of years ago and went 0 for 4 trips carpfishing last year until we fished for them off Big Cliff's dock...  Makes one wonder if they have lost their magic touch...LOL
30468,Carp,2007-02-03 20:57:00,1488,No worries CC. They probably saw you coming and headed straight for the fish market. (Less chance of getting hooked)  They'll turn on for you soon enough. I'm sure an angler like you won't be skunked for too long. Keep at 'em.
30471,tjsa,2007-02-03 21:03:00,1578,"WHAT?????????????????  A post by CC, without pictures, without a hookup???  LORD TUNDERIN', it just cannot be.  What is this world coming to??????"
30476,kemper,2007-02-03 21:13:00,2232,"Quick! Everyone to the river!  CC left some fish for the rest of us    whole lot of new fangled options I see here, Jeez i leave for vacation for 4 days and now Im all confused"
30489,Bly,2007-02-03 21:41:00,1556,Sorry to hear about the skunk..was thinking of heading out this AM also but just couldn't do it.... I am almost positive your next post will more than make up for it!   bly
30570,ccmtcanada,2007-02-04 03:22:00,7971,"Better luck next time Scott!!  At least you got home before the snow squalls hit the area.  Bly and I get skunked most nights we go out....we just post that we did....haha.  After fishing with you that one time, I know the skunk will be off soon.  It was uncanny when we went out...you said...you need new roe...then BANG a hit.  Another time you said ""gotta change the leaders and go a bit deeper""...then all of the sudden another hit.  With skill and knowledge like that, you'll be posting some nice chromies again soon."
