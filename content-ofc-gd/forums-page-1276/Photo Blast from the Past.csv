30366,SlowPoke,2007-02-03 14:43:00,2984,I don't remember when these were taken but it was wayyyy back when Owen Sound had salmon... Me & Bruce 
30080,Spiel,2007-02-02 18:03:00,9065,....With all these ice reports from Binbrook on the board lately I decided it would be fun to post a few summer time pictures of the terrific fishing a few friends and I used to enjoy at Binbrook from the comforts of my 16' square back sportspal with an old Sears Gamefisher electric. Enjoy!    Me and a typical Largie    My Buddy with a better than average Northern    and finally another buddy with a typical stringer of walleye. At the time it was pretty easy to get a mess of these everytime we went out.

30086,SlowPoke,2007-02-02 18:09:00,2984,Those were the good ole days... when you had time to pull the tour bus over between gigs and fish out of your squareback.
30087,Smokey,2007-02-02 18:10:00,1278,Great pics. I bet they bring back some long forgotten memories and proof that you actually do catch fish.  Thanks for posting them.

30135,Kirk,2007-02-02 19:42:00,347,They had camera's invented that long ago?
30143,Raf,2007-02-02 20:24:00,3495,i thought the world was B&W back then?  did ted turner get his paws on those pics?
30147,douG,2007-02-02 20:43:00,2693,"C: Dad, how come old photographs are always black and white? Didn't they have color film back then? D: Sure they did. In fact, those old photographs ARE in color. It's just the WORLD was black and white then.  C: Really? D: Yep. The world didn't turn color until sometime in the 1930s, and it was pretty grainy color for a while, too.  C: That's really weird. D: Well, truth is stranger than fiction.  C: But then why are old PAINTINGS in color?! If the world was black and white, wouldn't artists have painted it that way? D: Not necessarily. A lot of great artists were insane.  C: But... but how could they have painted in color anyway? Wouldn't their paints have been shades of gray back then? D: Of course, but they turned colors like everything else in the '30s.  C: So why didn't old black and white photos turn color too? D: Because they were color pictures of black and white, remember?"
30229,Mike Pike,2007-02-03 00:41:00,1332,"Spiel those are some great pics of some great fishing!  I used to fish the lake in the late 70's and early 80's and I remember my cousin telling me of a huge walleye he caught there.  I always thought it was just a story but now that I see your pics, I probably owe him an opology, eh?  lol  That lake has a special place in my heart because the first bass I ever caught was right there.  Like maybe 1980 or 1981.  Anyhow, I remember the fish and the fight like it was yesterday.  I think for many of us Hamiltonians, that was our first taste of fishing and the great outdoors.  Thanks for posting those photos!"
