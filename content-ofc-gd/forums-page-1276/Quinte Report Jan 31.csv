29776,Smokey,2007-02-02 02:25:00,1278,"Well I had a free day yesterday and with all the cold weather figured it was good to go. So I headed down to Belleville area and first two stops were at Skevy's and Cara Outdoors to get some minnows and info. Got great minnows from each and even better info, Thanks guys. So with all the choices I struck out and got set up for the afternoon.  Here is my set-up.   First fish never came till about 4 pm and it was about 6 lbs, after a quick pic it went right back into the bay.   After dark and with the full moon the fishing really got going. Here is a pic of the finder showing my jig action as the fish approaches I stop and jiggle it a bit and he comes up and sniffs it then swims away. If I wasn't taking the pics I probably could have convinced him to bite.   I took a few home for the table with the biggest 19"".   So It was a great trip to start the hardwater season out. All of them were caught on a Mr. Champ in green tipped with a couple minnows. Set lines with minnows never had a hit all afternoon and evening. The fish really picked up as the sun went down so if you can stay till after dark it sure is worth the effort."
