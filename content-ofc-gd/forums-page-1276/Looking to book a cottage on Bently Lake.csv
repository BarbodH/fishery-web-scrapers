30271,Smokey,2007-02-03 02:27:00,1278,I have a buddy that lives on the lake. I'll ask him about the fishing on monday when I see him again. My guess it bass fishing on the lake.
30293,John Bacon,2007-02-03 03:26:00,3277,"I think that there are pike in the lake; but I am not 100% certain.  It is close to Baptiste & Elephant lakes which have pike, SM & LM bass, muskie, & walleye... Baptiste also has some lake trout.  There are also quite a few trout lakes in the area such as Diamond lake which is stocked with lake trout."

Lots of good bass, pike and panfish and a few walleye. http://www.pineridge.cc about the same distance from the GTA as Bancroft area and a really nice beach on a quiet lake  jjcanoe"
