30207,fishersquige,2007-02-02 23:28:00,52,If its on cooks the two best operators are either whitey with Simcoe Fishing Adventures in keswick or Peter Ice Cabins Of Gilford.  Both have good quality service but I think Peter price is cheaper and he is one of the most helpful with his ice reports.  http://icecabins.com/ http://www.simcoefishingadventures.com/

30227,dsn,2007-02-03 00:38:00,1018, I was at Mitchells once. I was kinda disappointed cause they had no nets in the hut nor any gafs. Good thing I got skunked or I'd have problems landing fish.
