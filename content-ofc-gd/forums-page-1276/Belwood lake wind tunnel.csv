Around 11 the set line went off and yielded a pike of monumental proportions then I put the binoculars down and saw it was 18"".  Close to noon the wind picked right up and made it a trial so packed up and headed to a bar.  Ice there was 6-8"" and solid. Conservation area had plenty of minnows etc."
