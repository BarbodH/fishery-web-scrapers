30187,Clampet,2007-02-02 22:44:00,1947,"Urbanangler, Just wondering.. was that open water or on ice?"
30190,urbanangler1990,2007-02-02 22:52:00,933,"oh sorry, kinda forgot to mention that huh    it was hardwater, around 8 inches of it, we drove right on to the point..."
30192,fishergirl72,2007-02-02 23:01:00,455,"well thats to bad bud,i was the one that gave you all that info...tell me what you were using and your presentation maybe i can fine tune it for you...and hey you only fished it once ...you cant give up...cheers"

30246,ccmtcanada,2007-02-03 01:18:00,7971,Good try urbanangler!  You'll get em next time I'm sure!
30253,fishindevil,2007-02-03 01:35:00,6254,"well there is lots of fish there i guess they just had a case of lock jaw,your set-ups that you were using are fine...we always used a tip-up as well....right on the bottom like just 6inches above it...and we used small williams wobblers,little cleos and always used a small minow...so i guess you just have to try it again sometime...dont give up and you said there was nobody out there ??? lots of times we were the only people out there as well people would always ask us because they didnt think there was ever any fish there...thats just what we wanted them to think...that was the best part we had the whole place to ourselves better luck next time bud...cheers"
30266,urbanangler1990,2007-02-03 02:11:00,933,"thnx fishindevil, there were actually a lot of ppl, about the dozen of us, and i guess that is a lot for that bay, i was surprised..."
30279,bucktail,2007-02-03 02:42:00,1857,Keep trying urbanangler. There are massive northerns tha come shallow in the cold water period in Lake O tribs. 20-30lbs is not unrealistic.
30312,Weeds,2007-02-03 04:32:00,782,"Hey Urban, I've heard of people having good luck there recently; big pike I hear. I drive by the place on my way to work all the time. Maybe give it another shot. I'll PM you a link."
