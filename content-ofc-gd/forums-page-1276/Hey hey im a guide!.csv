30163,Clampet,2007-02-02 21:31:00,1947," Keep on posting reports, or replying to other members' posts, until you reach 500, or invest in a 22 to 30 something foot boat, get to know a Lake and where there are fish to be caught on a consistent, I mean consistent basis, have an advertising budget, and....voila, you too can be a guide. See, it isn't that big of a deal.  (at least the first part)."
