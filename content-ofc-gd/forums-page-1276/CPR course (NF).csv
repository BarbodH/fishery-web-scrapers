The classes used the well known mannequin victim, Rescue Anne, to practice.  My group's model was legless to allow for storage in a carrying case.  The class went off in groups to practice. As instructed, one of my classmates gently shook the doll and asked ""Are you all right?"" He then put his ear over the mannequin's mouth to listen for breathing.  Suddenly he turned to the instructor and exclaimed, ""She said she can't feel her legs!"""

Even though the legs are no longer there, and the way the human nervous system is set up, some folks feel 'pain' from their former legs.  I spent many years teaching CPR and also as an Instructor Trainer.  Lot's of jokes and quips came from those classes.  But your story makes sense.   We had some manikins that were hooked for mock breathing and a pulse ... you shoulda seen their reaction to that."

29986,Smokey,2007-02-02 15:05:00,1278,"We still use Annie for all our training. She has become quite advanced in the past few years. She now has equipment to create a pulse for checking and plugs for the defib leads for training.  She used to have a fake plastic hair piece that came off and one of the guys used to wear it around, it fit his head perfect. Always good for a laugh."
