Leahs X-country skis and my snowshoes, with just our clothes and some food needing to be thrown in as we head out the door in the morning.  Be back mid week +/-...if you don' t hear from me (wouldn't that be nice!) they're having a bit of trouble getting me out of my new boat, that's very temporarily stored in the showroom!  Wayne"

30198,Smokey,2007-02-02 23:16:00,1278,Drive safe Wayne and have a great trip. Will be expecting a report with pics when you return.  Remember to take off the shoes before you get in the boat.

30407,irishfield,2007-02-03 18:22:00,26272,Thanks Guys! We're in a one day delay at this point due to some unforeseen circumstances this morning. Hope to hit the highway tomorrow am now.
30418,Carp,2007-02-03 18:54:00,1488,"Sounds like fun Wayne.  Bring us back some pics. (no, no, not the naked Irish dude part of the trip.  )  Have fun and be careful."
30432,irishfield,2007-02-03 19:15:00,26272,Don't worry Remo...with a -40 to -48c wind chill warning for the North/east region tonight and -33C mornings and -20c highs right into early next week... not much chance of that. I'm thinking we might rethink this whole thing and go mid week instead when the temps look higher.
30446,tjsa,2007-02-03 20:09:00,1578,"Wussy!!!!! I thought you irish were made of sterner stuff, JUST KIDDING!!!!!!  Yup, probably a good plan to wait for better temps Wayne, you just do not need to have any vehicle or other problems in those weather conditions. We are experiencing the same weather up here, and I would not even think about a trip in these conditions. I used to go out regardless(when I was young and stupid), but now(I am still stupid, but much older) I prefer to play it much safer on trips. Fondly(yeah, right) remember going to our camp near Atikokan, for a week. We would have to take the batteries out of the vehicles, and bring them with us to the camp on the sleighs. When we got back out, we had to put the batteries back in, and use a 20 lb. propane tank with a tiger torch on it, with some exhaust tubing that garages have, to slide under the vehicles with a 90 degree upturn, and aim it at the oil pan, fire up the torch, and heat the block and oil pan area to be able to start the vehicles again. This would take an hour at least, all the while we were standing around in those minus whatever temps. We did not dare seek shelter in the vehicles, the windows would ice up within minutes, and even when the cars started, it was another 20 minutes to clear the insides of the glass of the frost from us breathing  Ahh, the good ol' days, wish I could forget about them now in one sense, but in another, it was a learning experience."
30456,irishfield,2007-02-03 20:35:00,26272,"Yah we are Tom...but my Dutch wife isn't anymore! LOL  She was the ""unforeseen circumstance"" this morning...as I couldn't bring myself to waking her up..... with her finally getting some sleep after a week of being at St. Mike's hospital with our Daughter. I slipped out of bed and left her there to sleep.  Of course now I find out from Jim up in Temagami that it's only -15C up there today. Dead Calm and sunny. Oh well, guess we'll handle it tomorrow no matter what it brings....  Ah.. the good old days...when the only concern was what beverage to put in the sled storage hole. Warm = Buck a bottle/get ya by wine Cold = JD Really cold = 151 Bacardi"
30458,Carp,2007-02-03 20:39:00,1488,Play it safe and wait for warmer temps. More chance of clothing being peeled off.
30465,tjsa,2007-02-03 20:50:00,1578," Nope, not me, never bring the stuff anymore, only water, and hot soup in a thermos(chicken broth or beef broth). Course now, i only day trip, no need for it, or the extra weight and space it will take up, I can wait til' I am home to savour the taste of alcohol."
