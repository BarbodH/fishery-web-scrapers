30478,tjsa,2007-02-03 21:15:00,1578,"Scott, even a person of your size cannot make that fish look small, it is definately a big fish, and extremely thick in girth and the shoulders, well done. Thanks for the post, I won't be after steel until mid april, and will not catch anything near that size up here. Heck, I hope we have enough water to even fish for them, we were in drought conditions in the fall, all of our rivers were mere trickles up the north shore. I didn't even bother to bother the fish in those conditions.  We need precipitation up here badly, for the spawn, and for the fire fighting season. Lots of people have dry wells, and have to haul water in their trucks for general consumption. Lots of people up here have to shower at their workplace, and if that option is not available, join a club to shower before work, the water levels are that bad up here."
