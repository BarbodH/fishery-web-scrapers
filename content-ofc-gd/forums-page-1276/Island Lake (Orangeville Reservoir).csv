He is very patient, and even fishes youth bass tournaments, so he is willing to wait for the pike.  Anyone ever fish there ?  have any suggestions ??  Thanks"
30106,snackpack5150,2007-02-02 18:40:00,79,If you walk out from the North end and walk South about 1000ft nice weed bed and the pike like to hang out. Used a cyclops with minnows seemed to work well.  Good Luck  Ken
30109,cityfisher,2007-02-02 18:43:00,959,i have fished there multiple times and the basic live bait rig works best or a williams with a minnow attached... Very simple techniques
