30357,eyefish,2007-02-03 14:01:00,135,where you go is up to you...east or west...I have a tendancy to stay on the west side...you can get bait in town..as far as type of minnows I use dace NOT shinners...i alwasy use the same lure..can't really say what it it is( i mean I know but just not saying) lets call it  the magic lure but with sccuggog being so shallow I like it because it falls slow and gives off some decent flash!
30360,Eddyk,2007-02-03 14:08:00,195,I lived in Caesarea for 12 years so I like the east side. I always had luck with minnows or jig with a Swedish Pimple. There used to be a bait shop on #7 just east of town. Good luck.
