29898,dsn,2007-02-02 11:34:00,1018,I was wondering for those folks who fish in a hut. How do you fix your transducer or wedge it against the huts floor opening with out the thing falling into the water. I usually just bring a coat hanger and stick the transducer through that and then wedge it against the wood half in the water half out and that works but I have lost many hangers cause of that. Or I can't seem to keep the same hanger through out the each ice season.  The transducer I have has the suction cup on it but thats useless on ice let alone wood.   Thanks for any suggestions.  If no one has any better ideas I gues I'll have to go back and use the old coat hanger thingy again.  Thanks for any suggestions.  dsn

There is another way and thats bending a piece of 1/4 inch rod and making it so you can just stick it in a drilled hole and the other end rest in the water."
29989,Smokey,2007-02-02 15:08:00,1278,I don't do anything with mine other then hang it down in the hole pointed towards bottom and then put the unit on the cable to hold it in place. Then it's easy enough to get out of the way in a hurry.
29997,Terry,2007-02-02 15:28:00,14456,I like to use a hunk of styrofoam above the transducer on the wire and just drop it in the hole and it's self adjusting I just converted my x67c icemachine fishfinder
30075,Sinker,2007-02-02 17:56:00,8692,"a small piece of pool noodle makes a great float for transducers. A slice part way thru, slide in the wire.....then a bit of duct tape and your off to the races.......just yank it out when you get that big one to the hole!!  Sinker"

30159,dsn,2007-02-02 21:19:00,1018,"Thanks for all the replies. I guess the ""T"" method should be simple enough. OR maybe I'll try the strofoam also.   Thanks again!!  dsn"
