30397,Rich Clemens,2007-02-03 17:55:00,3131,"Welcome aboard.  Lot of folks on here with a wealth of knowledge on just about any topic.  We love reports and pics whenever you can post them.  Been quite a while since I set up an Avitar.  Click on the Controls link at the top of the OFC page.  That should take you into a section with a whole bunch of options for your personal setup.  Once in the controls, there is a seletion along the left-hand side to Edit Avitar Settings - click on this.  There is a place in there for you to download pictures.  Dang ... been too long to remember the detail steps.  LOts of others on here that can give you more precise directions.  Again ... Welcome to OFC !!!"
