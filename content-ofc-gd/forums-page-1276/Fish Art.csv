Then they paint the mold and they look really nice. Every year we pick a few. They go pretty fast so we got to get to the art show early. My favorite one is the walleye. But we also have a largemouth, crappie, sunfish and a sheephead. Does any body else have any type of fish art pictures that they want to share?   "
