Also a fairly thick liner in them & roomy enough to tuck in my insulated coveralls. Rated for -58 deg. F.  Called Icicles and on sale at TSC for $35. I don't know how long the sale is on.  Best Wishes: Rick"

30514,Woodsman,2007-02-03 23:15:00,1286,"Tried the boots out today. After fishing today I can only say "" 2 thumbs up"". Fishing was slow & I got skunked but it was so cold & windy I only lasted 3 hrs. Seen about 6 small pike caught. My feet were not the problem which is usually the first place I start to get cold. At times you could only see about a hundred yards but what was worse was all the snow blowing in your hole & quickly slushing over.  Best Wishes: Rick"
