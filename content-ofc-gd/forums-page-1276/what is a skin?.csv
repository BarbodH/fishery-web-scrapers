29994,motv8tr,2007-02-02 15:16:00,2587,"I really don't know how to explain it...but here's an attempt.  On your screen, when you open the message board, what colors do you get?  The ""skin"" is what you see, and thanks to the mods, or Rick I guess, there are a few different color schemes available.  Scroll down to the bottom of the page on the left you will see whatever skin you are using, likely default?  click on the arrow and you can pick a different one.  Hope that helps.  Maureen"
