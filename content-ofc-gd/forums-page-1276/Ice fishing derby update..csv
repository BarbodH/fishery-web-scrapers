30272,skevys,2007-02-03 02:27:00,27,Just to bring things up to date for you all on the derby. The price is $25.00 per adult and kids 12 and under is only $10.00. The kid’s first second and third price will be a St Croix ice rod and reel .Prizes from 4th down will be lures and plastics. The first price for the adults is a 10 and ½ inch electric Ice auger. Second price is a survival suit and third price is still to come. Remember this derby is for the smallest. NOT BIGGEST. The derby is on the 25th of February 2007. Hopefully I can find some more help on the donations. If I can’t I will also put up the third price myself. I’m trying to get a one man ice hut. I will update this by next weekend. Thx. Ron
