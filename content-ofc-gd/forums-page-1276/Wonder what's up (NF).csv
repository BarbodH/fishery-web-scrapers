30144,Joey,2007-02-02 20:33:00,9122,I was just sitting here reading OFC when two cops and a police dog ran through my front yard and up the road.  Wonder what they could be searching for?  How exciting.  The dog is on a LONG leash and they keep letting him get a whiff then he takes off fast again and they keep running as fast as they can after it.  Interesting - better lock my door.  Joey
