30134,pigeonfisher,2007-02-02 19:41:00,696,I like the original one.  Driftwood I guess.  I notice no changes since the changeover.
30136,pigeonfisher,2007-02-02 19:42:00,696,"Nope, I like the Club.  That is what I thought I meant the first time."
30325,Carp,2007-02-03 06:51:00,1488,CLUB !
29546,dustink,2007-02-01 19:26:00,526,"I like the driftwood, but I'm curious as to everyone else's prefs.  BTW...nice job with the upgrade!!  dk"
29552,urbanangler1990,2007-02-01 19:33:00,933,"y is there an x for group icon? i liked the on or off, user better than this one, other thant that its better..."
29553,TJQ,2007-02-01 19:37:00,7806,I like club personally... looks rich... unlike me...
29554,TJQ,2007-02-01 19:38:00,7806,I do think we should have a really pinky female version though.. lol  good idea!!
29557,~CK~,2007-02-01 19:39:00,30,"I like the Club skin. Of course, I like any skin by Dragonfly."
29558,Raf,2007-02-01 19:42:00,3495,default ipb.   fast and un-cluttered with eye-candy.
29562,Joey,2007-02-01 19:50:00,9122,"PINK TJ?  I think that maybe YOU would like pink, personally, I like Red  Joey"
29565,SlowPoke,2007-02-01 19:54:00,2984,"Thank you for restoring the Driftwood skin. I prefer the colours and the icons. I also like the default ipb but there is/was an issue at the top of the page with the OFC logo and blog, gallary buttons ec. wrapping. That may be my display settings however. Another issue I noticed, in my profile it defaults to the ""Topics"" tab. It so happens that my recent topics include images which push the right column off the screen. Could we have a side-scroller on the topic tab instead of having to side-scroll the entire page? Love the new features too! -Brian  edit: I see the default ipb skin is different than yesterday - it works fine, very fast!"
29566,mattyk,2007-02-01 19:59:00,2110,I like the club.
29568,SlowPoke,2007-02-01 20:01:00,2984,"I wish I had ""the club"" in my Jeep the other night!"
29572,nautifish,2007-02-01 20:08:00,1416,lol @ pink.  Actually my favorite colour happens to be hunter green. Pink NO!!!!...LOL
29577,ccmtcanada,2007-02-01 20:11:00,7971,I prefer driftwood too.  I find it much easier to determine which threads have new messages and which ones dont.  I dunno...just me though!
29578,lew,2007-02-01 20:12:00,12767,"I think the default is faster, but the Club seems easier on my eyes"
29583,keram,2007-02-01 20:19:00,585, As of today definitely in my own ( but it can change )
29584,Motorhead,2007-02-01 20:20:00,163,I also prefer the driftwood skin...   thanks for bringing it back...  Doug  p.s.  nice job on the up-grades
29694,Dondorfish,2007-02-01 22:50:00,1000,Driftwood for me -  happy to see it back!  Look at all these new fangled boxes ( first post since the change ) Guess i'll have to learn it all over again Looks pretty spiffy thou    Don   
29710,motv8tr,2007-02-01 23:29:00,2587,"I prefer the club, it's easier on the eyes and I like the green.  It's really nice having the different options though, thanks guys.  Maureen"
29711,irishfield,2007-02-01 23:32:00,26272,Put your sunglasses on Maureen and use the default skin. Much faster on dial up than the others!
29716,OhioFisherman,2007-02-01 23:53:00,6623,"I got no clue, the skin I am in?"
29717,Marc Thorpe,2007-02-01 23:57:00,621,What skin are you comfortable in?   My Own
29721,Roy,2007-02-02 00:25:00,13728,This is a fishing site. What's with the skin talk?
29852,kennyman,2007-02-02 04:56:00,737,Love the OFC Club backdrop. I'm not sure how it could get any better. Your choice of fish LOL?
29899,Rich Clemens,2007-02-02 11:35:00,3131,OFC Driftwood ... a little easier on the eyes.
29944,JEREMY,2007-02-02 13:51:00,300,HOW DO I CHANGETHE SKINS?
