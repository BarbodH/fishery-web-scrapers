Had too... just had too...   Gerritt."
29727,ccmtcanada,2007-02-02 00:32:00,7971,NIIIIIICE!!!!!!  I almost choked when I saw the ticket price though....LOL.  Enjoy the game!  I'll be looking for you on TV!!!
29736,Corey,2007-02-02 00:54:00,355,Ya Gerritt... I am available on the 17th... meet at your place?    cd.
29747,Carp,2007-02-02 01:17:00,1488,"Good stuff Gerritt. Enjoy the game.  The good guys are playing some decent hockey lately. Hope they keep it up and get everyone healthy. They're really missing Peca on the penalty killing, but you do what you can with what you have.  Cheers   Cliff, I know what you mean about the ticket prices. Toronto is my favourite team and always has been. I lived in Toronto for 28 years and now in neighbouring Mississauga for 10 years. I've never seen a Leafs game live. I did see them live once. Spent $10/ticket to see the team skills competition around the time of the all star game a few years ago."
29757,irishfield,2007-02-02 01:33:00,26272,I only see them live in the same manner Gerritt will be. Dupont and various other plastics suppliers have always been pretty good in keeping us in tickets. Ticket prices are NUTS! My son and daughter went New Years Day and son and wife a week after that. I prefer my chair and TV remote!  Have fun Gerritt..and keep your eyes on the puck!
29768,silveradosheriff,2007-02-02 01:57:00,1025,See you at the game!  :-)
29770,DanTheMan,2007-02-02 02:03:00,257,"I would be exicted also if I was going to see the Oilers Live,  Great stuff"
29783,Carp,2007-02-02 02:33:00,1488," Exactly Wayne.  - No second mortgage to buy tickets - No line ups to get into the arena. - No line ups for the toilet. - No line ups for concession stands. - I can eat whatever I want at grocery store prices. - I can drink whatever I want at grocery, liquour and beer store prices - My sofa is 100 x more comfy than a seat at the arena. - I get all the replays from every angle. - I can switch to another game (Raptors,etc.) during the intermission if I want. - I don't have to worry about parking/transportation. - When the game is over, I'm already home. - ....and I keep the laptop on the end table so I can surf the OFC while watching the game."
29788,Guest Trophymuskie,2007-02-02 02:44:00,0,But it's the makebeliefs but foir a buck 85 I'd go see them get thumped.
29790,iceguy,2007-02-02 02:50:00,341,There playing alot better these days.Raycroft is in the zone. Hope you will cheer louder than all the suit around.Was given tickets for the florida panther 7-2 lost in dec. Still had a great time.Nice gift. l
29847,moemoe,2007-02-02 04:45:00,352,"NIce tickets! I tried to bid on ebay for a couple of the tickets, missed out, so instead the wife and I are gonna go to edmonton on a ""weekend getaway"" to catch a friday night  game blackhawks, oilers on the 9th"
29851,kennyman,2007-02-02 04:53:00,737,Wish I was going. I haven't been to the ACC to see hockey yet. Saw the Raptors (beautiful seats for free). I went to the gardens quite a bit. When prices were WAY better and I didn't have kids etc. Too many places for money to go now and not enough of it to blow $400 on one game. Have a great time. Hope the Buds  win. My two favorite teams by the way.
29869,Spiel,2007-02-02 05:29:00,9065,"....Ah, the perks of being a salaried employee. But then again it's only a hockey game."
29915,huey graphite,2007-02-02 12:22:00,362,"Nice score! (pun intended)  Just curious to know, why are the barcodes covered up in the pics?"
29919,Gerritt,2007-02-02 12:33:00,6129,"  They are unique to every ticket, and are followed by a series of numbers... these two things are basically your ticket... and who knows who is reading this site.. it is not the members I am concerned with... but the lurkers, who knows there are people out there that are counterfiters... and there have been issues with counterfit Leafs tickets in the past.   Gerritt."
29981,Smokey,2007-02-02 14:56:00,1278,Hey Richard I remember when we were fishing in the fall I took abuse all day in the boat about the Sens and Leafs game you were seeing that night. If I remember correct wasn't the score something like 6-0 for the Leafs. When will you learn bud the Leafs Rule.  Gerritt have a great time at the game.  Mike
30062,huey graphite,2007-02-02 17:27:00,362,  That's what I figured. Wise decision....you never know.
30067,steve_paul,2007-02-02 17:40:00,658,What time do you want me to pick you up Gerritt??  Have a great time at the game.
