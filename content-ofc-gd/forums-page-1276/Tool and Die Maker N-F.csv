He is now looking for work.  He lives in the Mississauga area.  If anyone knows of any T and D jobs that are available, please send me an email.  I have his resume and it is quite impressive.  I would not normally post something like this, but this guy would be an asset to any company.  Email  = [email protected]  Thanks to all for any assistance,  Mark"
