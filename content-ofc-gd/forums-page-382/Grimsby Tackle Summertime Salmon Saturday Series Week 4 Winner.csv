Not only did it help us win the Grimsby Tackle Summer Saturday Salmon Series Derby and be the largest king weighed in to date for the derby,  that king along with another king weighing 24.34# won us 1st place overall as well as big fish in the Strait Line Angler/Grimsby Tackle Salmon Dance tourney for a combined weight of 59.26# setting a new tournament record!  Thanks for the great day gents     Cheers G."
