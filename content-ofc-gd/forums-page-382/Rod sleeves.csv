718204,lew,2012-07-27 09:39:00,12766,"It's always a pain trying to get rods out of the locker cause they always catch on each other, so I finally decided to catch up to the 21st century and order some sleeves for them.  I contacted Phil but he didn't have any but he put me on to a guy he knows who makes them.  I called the manufacturer and told him that I needed a bunch of sleeves to fit musky rods and he said it wasn't a problem and just tell him exactly what sizes I needed and he made them to custom fit each rod. He made them up, put them in the mail and I had them 2 days later.  Fantastic service !!  Sure is nice to be able to put them in the lockers and bring them back out without everything getting hung up.  They were only $6.00 each and shipping was $9.00 total from Brampton area to my place.  Not trying to SPAM here, just passing along some info on a great company to deal with. If anyones interested his website is WWW.CCRODSOCKS.COM  For some reason I can't post a link  Here's some of the covers.    And here they are nicely tucked into the front locker. There's more in a side locker too.  "
