716790,spincast,2012-07-21 23:40:00,3279,great outing on a beauty day. Congrats.
716799,Leecher,2012-07-22 00:19:00,7832,Nice Davey!!!  Sounds like fun
716938,misfish,2012-07-22 18:02:00,29133,Way to go buddy.
717000,Joeytier,2012-07-22 22:22:00,3990,...Except for the ones on the stringer?  Nice fish.  The bass were on fire yesterday!
717011,davey buoy,2012-07-22 23:01:00,5505," Lol,we kept a couple of the better ones for pictures on the stringer. All swam away for another day!!!"
717214,bubbles,2012-07-23 19:16:00,591,"  I am Sorry but that is odd, take a pic of te fish if you want, them let him swim.  No need for a stringer unless you are eating them."
717217,misfish,2012-07-23 19:29:00,29133, Each their own I guess.
717219,misfish,2012-07-23 19:37:00,29133,  Can you back that up bud?
717226,misfish,2012-07-23 19:52:00,29133, AHHHH Thanks for clearing that.LMAO.
717228,davey buoy,2012-07-23 19:59:00,5505,"Thanks guys,I'm sorry,thanks for clearing that up. believe me no harm was done. Never again.     On a side note I can't believe you guys would even question that!!!But you never know!!"
717287,Joeytier,2012-07-23 22:06:00,3990,"I didn't comment at first, and I really don't care, but it does stress the fish out big time to be dragging them around on a stringer, and IMO there's a good chance they didn't make it, even though they may have swam away healthy.  Keep 'em next time"
718411,northernpike56,2012-07-28 02:22:00,717,"I caught a walleye at my cottage on the dock, put it on my stringer, fished the rest of the morning with no luck, then threw it back because I didn't feel like cleaning and cooking just one. I caught the same one less than a week later. how do I know? it had a 'soar' gill flap. Fish was handled nicely on the stringer, and obviously would have lived if he didn't get filleted the second time I caught him"
718413,misfish,2012-07-28 02:29:00,29133,"  And IMO,they may have. It,s nothing new to keep fish on a stringer for the day and release them. I have seen many swim away happy and healty. If your just floating around,theirs no harm,as long as they are strung right.IMO.a basket type keeper would be better."
