I have my first real fishing trip planned for next year, were going to Ceaser's Lodge and will be fishing Lake Impossible. My question is this, I have always fished small lakes here in NJ and streams and I have no idea of what type of rod and reel setup I should be get. What lb and type of line?  Any info or help you guys can give would be great.  Thanks a lot"

What type of fish are you going after?  Assuming it is a walleye/pike area I would want at least 2 outfits (I think I brought 5 combos on my fly-in).  1. A medium or medium/light spinning rod/reel with 15 or 20lb test braided line.  2. A medium or medium/heavy bait-casting rod/reel with 30 or maybe 50lb test braid.  One piece rods are nice, if not necessarily needed, and can be accommodated by most outfitters but definitely check first."
718486,maddevildog,2012-07-28 19:40:00,3,What length(s)?
718488,kickingfrog,2012-07-28 20:01:00,8333,"Most of rods are 6' 6"" or 7'. My preference would be 6'6"" for the spinning and 7 for the bait-casting. Although if you go with the 2 piece I'd look to go 7' or even 7'6"" just cause you can break them down anyway."
718490,Handlebarz,2012-07-28 20:12:00,3790,Welcome aboard like KF was asking what are you after? What reels can you use spinning bait caster? Or just closed face it makes a big difference what you should buy then.
718493,maddevildog,2012-07-28 20:44:00,3,"were going for Pike and Walleye, I can use both spinning and bait casters."
