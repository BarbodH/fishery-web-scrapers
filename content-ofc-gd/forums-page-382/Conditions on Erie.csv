I am planning on a good day tomorrow, and want to know what to prep for. BTW ill be in the hunt for more smalljaw bass  Thanks  Tight lines. Luke"

718312,Court R,2012-07-27 17:54:00,213,It will be fine.
718314,Billy Bob,2012-07-27 17:56:00,5865,Even if there was a mud line you should be fishing well past it to find deep cooler water.
718317,Luke V.,2012-07-27 18:15:00,286,Thats what I was hoping to hear!  Thanks for the replies
718506,Luke V.,2012-07-29 00:11:00,286,Update: went to crystal beach launch for 6:00 meaning I left at 5. Got there and the lake was rolling good. Decided to launch at chippawa and head to navy island on the upper river. Fished there until 11:30. With only one smallie. Went down the welland river in the hunt. Found a bunch of guys fishing a local bass tournament. Turns out they werent catching much either. Guess the weather was just to off today to make the bite happen. Oh well was better than going to work. Luke
