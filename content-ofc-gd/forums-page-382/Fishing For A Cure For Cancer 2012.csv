716995,asdve23rveavwa,2012-07-22 22:06:00,2690,"It's all over for another year!!!  Hard to believe, but, a years worth of planning and work came to fruition Saturday, July 21st with the fourth annual Fish-A-Thon. As in each of the past years the event continued to grow.  More participants, more sponsors, and...MOST IMPORTANTLY...more money raised for the fight against the deadly disease that has touched nearly all of us!!  I will let Dan and Ryan chime in with the numbers when they get a chance.  As a teaser though, last I heard we were over $14 000!   We all couldn't have asked for a better day.  The weather was perfect, and, definitely contributed to the joy that was shared by the participants.  The size of the smiles made up for the lack of size in the fish, except for a carp that measured out at almost 30"" to win big fish of the day!  The toughest part of this whole post is narrowing it down to about 55 pics or so.  We are going to include a link at the end of the photos that will give anyone the opportunity to see/copy any of the 300 photos.  As volunteers for the event Juli, myself, Carl, Caelan and Ceagan would just like to say thanks to all who were there yesterday to make it such a great day.  Once, again, I will let Dan (the sponsorman) chime in with the thanks to all the sponsors. I will say that a certain lady from Dixie Tackle once again went above and beyond!!!!!!!!  Anyways, enough of my yapping.  Here's the pics from registration through to wrap up. Oh yeah, anyone that was involved yesterday give yourself a round of applause, people and participation are what makes this event what it is! Enjoy!                                                                                              The best for last...with a whopping $1400 in pledges!!  Amazing work, Tom!!!!  "
717001,spincast,2012-07-22 22:26:00,3279,Looks like a great day guys - Kudos to all who volunteered their time and energies to make this happen. G and I hope to make it next year.  So Frank - who won the biggest fish $20 this year - you or Juli? (edit - ) forgot to say - this is a GREAT photo 
717004,kickingfrog,2012-07-22 22:33:00,8333,"I like the action shot of the ""flipper""."
717005,Handlebarz,2012-07-22 22:34:00,3790,Dang awesome job guys looking at all the pics it feels like just yesterday.
717007,danbouck,2012-07-22 22:46:00,4380,"Awesome pics!  Huge congrates to Tom Cox who won most pledges. Tom is an inspiration, not only for raising so much money but doing it while fighting the battle himself.  Also a congrats to my buddy Matt who stole my boat, rod and lures and won the Big Bass Award.  I'm barely keeping my eyes open so I'll chime in more tomorrow."
717008,HTHM,2012-07-22 22:46:00,4082,"Just a pair of grandfathers doing what they do best. The kids this year were GREAT! I have to give a shout out to Jason and his lady-love Ashley, I had a great day with the two of you. PS: Remind Ryan to NOT give me a squirt bottle next year  :santa:  :devil:  Check out Jason's band Crossley Hunter, they're easy to listen to."
717010,asdve23rveavwa,2012-07-22 23:01:00,2690,"Just realised I forgot the group shots, doh!!        My lovely lady in action  "
717012,asdve23rveavwa,2012-07-22 23:13:00,2690," Hope you both can make it next year!!  As for big fish wager, we didn't do it this year.  Seriously, Juli and I maybe fished for 2 1/2 hours.  Most of our time was spent helping out, and, I wouldn't have it any other way, wasn't even going to bring our boat, and, the main reason I did was so we could get some shots of everyone else fishing. I think my massive bluegill edged out her rock bass, lol!"
717013,Loonietoon,2012-07-22 23:15:00,1450,I am very pleased to see that this event went very well again.. Hats off to Ryan & Dan for this event and every one else that participated in it....

717060,d_paluch,2012-07-23 02:02:00,343, the 'dogs were good too!
717088,FisherJuli,2012-07-23 03:30:00,125," Hahaha- you two are always fun to get pics of, and I couldn't resist the pic of you two sleeping!  But seriously, it is always a great time to be with bunch of great guys (knife weilding, spray gun toting Alberts and all!!) and to participate in something that is near and dear to us all. The sponsors, the awards, the prizes are impressive icing on the cake.  Dan and Ryan, and the rest of the volunteers--you outdid yourselves!"
717126,The Urban Fisherman,2012-07-23 13:38:00,2050,"Hey guys! YOU ALL ROCK!    I think that goes without saying... this is truly a group effort and every last one of you guys should be proud of what we accomplished!  By the time all the awesomeness that is the Fish-A-Thon wound down it was Sunday and Ginny and I decided to just stay the night and come home early this morning!  Dan and I will follow up as soon as we can with closing details!  Thanks again - I'm proud of what we put together as a group and am very much looking forward to next year!  Cheers, Ryan"
717134,fishnsled,2012-07-23 14:32:00,3520,"Great report Frank and Juli!!  As this was my first Fish-A-Thon to participate in it truly was a great day and weekend. It is awesome how a bunch of people pulled together to make this event so incredible. Dan, Ryan, Ginny, and so many others behind the scenes planning, organizing and just busting their 's to make the day the best they can for all the participants. My hats off to you........you outdid yourselves! . 	Looking forward to next year and doing it all over again.  It was also great to finally meet some of the members here and good to see some old faces too. Looking forward to November Mike!"
717136,Harrison,2012-07-23 14:47:00,2202,"Just wasn't in the cards this year, but would love to bring my girls to the 2013 event.  You can count on eTackle.ca's support as on going.  Phil"
717167,asdve23rveavwa,2012-07-23 16:32:00,2690,"Couple other things I wanted to say.  As participants in all but the first event, it is amazing how much this has turned into a family gathering.  The second Fish-A-Thon (our first) had, literally, a handful of kids.  The last two events have had many children participating, and, it gives me hope for the future of our sport, as well as the future in general!!  Also, I find myself meeting more members of the OFC everytime.  Was great to finally meet Spiel, aka the ""rod-master"" and his family!  The perch rod he built and donated was a thing of beauty.  The plastic it was wrapped in weighed more than the rod!  Thanks, from both Juli and myself, for the comments all!!  Hope all who participated have had a chance to check out the Photobucket link and copy any of the photos of themselves that didn't make it on this post."
717215,Spiel,2012-07-23 19:18:00,9065," Great pics Frankie and *Juli*, thanks for not only taking the time to take them all, but also for posting and linking them.  It was my first outing to the Fish-a-Thon and though I didn't participate in the actual event I'm already planning on popping up a tent for the weekend next year and actually fishing it. My support will always be there as long as I'm able.  It was wonderful to finally meet you Frankie and the Mrs' and see some familiar faces as well as some new ones, SRT8 comes to mind right off.  To those who made it happen, up front and behind the scenes, to quote Ryan, ""You guys rock."""
717298,vinnimon,2012-07-23 22:51:00,2593,"Awesome report and pics   Unfortunetely once again I couldnt attend this year, but im sure me and my girls will there for the next event. Congrats Ryan and dan for a great turn out"
717327,SRT8 smoker craft,2012-07-24 00:44:00,1107, It was nice to meet you to Spiel anytime you want to visit some of your old stomping grounds let me know some lake Erie steel perhaps ?
717329,The Urban Fisherman,2012-07-24 00:48:00,2050,Heyo - Just adding a few pics of my own!  Julie whopped by butt with the photos and for that I can't thank her enough!  Glad to have your whole family on board!  We fished for 15 minutes before starting the day... something kept us from being able to get up as early as we had hoped...    Dan got a wee one in those 15 minutes... 2 actually... for a total weight limit of a half pound! lol   Here's the big fish of the day - small for deer creek standards but that's all he needed... I always said if you want to win big fish go carp fishing!   Laurie from Dixie Tackle hangin with the kids! She's awesome!   Brian Beaumont won big fish last year and could have tied it this year I believe... a good angler and a good dude all around!   Shawn's little man kissing a nice little largie! lol   This guy was leading big fish for a little while! He almost took it to!   Catch and release fishing at a young age! We do all this work to raise money for such a great cause and this kind of thing is an awesome bonus!   Thanks Guys! I hope you had a blast and I can't wait until next year! It's gonna be CRAZY!
