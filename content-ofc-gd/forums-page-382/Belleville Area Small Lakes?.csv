Can anyone let me know about some accessible small lakes nearby suitable for my 12 foot inflatable with 30lb thrust trolling motor? So no Bay of Quinte thank you. lol.  East Lake, Lake on the Mountain PP, Fish Lake, Consecon Lake, Roblin Lake, Oak Lake.  Looking for bass or the occasional pike or walleye.   Thanks."
