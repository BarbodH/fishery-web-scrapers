717981,johnnyb,2012-07-26 13:24:00,3413,"In a couple of days, I take off for a week of glorious relaxation and fun with friends and family at Gull Lake.  Getting to this point has been kind of crazy though.  In a nutshell….the wife got a new job with more pay, which was great.  Lots of weekend hours though, which was horrible.  At the very least, the new job allowed her to keep our vacation week intact.  With about a week to go before her 3 month probation, the store manager let her go…and it seemed to be very personal, as my wife had been really well received by that manager's boss, the District manager.   We are a bit stunned, the wife emails the DM to at least tell her side of things, and we hear nothing back.  This is over the course of last weekend.  Tuesday rolls around and my boss pulls me aside.  He is very upset to tell me that my position is going away, as the company is being restructured.  Like, one partner is being bought out, lots of things changing, he will set me up with a decent severance plan, but, that's it, I'm done.  WOW.  Hold on….it gets better.  By Wednesday morning, I have a better offer from my employer.  Instead of managing my crews from the office, manage them from the trucks.  Punch the clock, make more $$, and get AZ license training.  For some reason, they thought I would view that as a demotion…but someone in management was perceptive enough to realize that I'm kind of an outdoorsy guy, and why would I mind working outside?  Now there's no point in having the wife work, because I will more than make up the extra money she netted after paying for daycare.  More time for her with our daughter.  Weekends back in place.  Cha-CHING!  The icing on the cake was Wednesday night, when the head office of HER former employer called her to say that she never should have been let go, is absolutely re-hireable, and the DM would personally ensure she gets into a store if she wants.  WOW AGAIN.  Sufficed to say, it has been a bit of a whirlwind week.  So much so, that when our phones beeped simultaneously just before midnight last night, we both said ""Oh look….it's our anniversary tomorrow!""  Both of us would have completely forgotten.  So, with that in mind, this week of vacation will be perfectly timed to take a few deep breaths before starting out on a new routine.  It should also yield quite a few fish pictures, because I have some time to make up for.  I haven't been on the water in over 3 weeks!  And in the past couple of years, I've been able to go almost every weekend….so it has been a struggle.  I figured I'd share what little fishing I have accomplished this season….from the week before bass opener where I had a great time on Rice lake, to a couple outings on Gull Lake for bass.  Hope you enjoy the pics….I felt like I had to get them out of the way before posting more  My buddie's boat….not mine…really nice Nitro Z-7     First Rice Lake 'eye     If you fish Rice, you are never lonely     Second or third Rice 'eye….limited out that morning     Dang I love me a fast bass boat!     Me and buddy's limit     Bass opener with Bicephalic….he couldn't be bothered to wait until we were in the boat….pulled this one out from under the dock     Booyeah!  Pad Crasher, that is…     Bert and I caught quite a few more on opener….nothing terribly pic worthy, sadly.  I got back up a week or two later and found this chunk     Dock smallies by moonlight     My last outing….3.5 weeks ago          Gave the LiveTarget some love     "
