718188,ehg,2012-07-27 03:38:00,2666,Fish don't do death rolls. Think you are confusing fish with alligators.  Fish don't swim backwards either.  Have caught hundreds of musky/pike after 30 yrs. hardcore fishing. Had musky/pike hit walleye while reeling in. They don't leave single puncture wounds or do death rolls. Usually there rows of teeth leave large mouth shaped cut wounds from rows of relatively small but razor sharp teeth before they let go.  The first answer of snapping turtle seems most correct and have seen minks raid stringers as well.  Oh well...
718191,Gregoire,2012-07-27 03:52:00,1397,I had a musky do a death roll earlier this year and a pike do one last week. Not sure about that statement. You're assessment of the thief seems accurate to me though.
718193,ehg,2012-07-27 04:15:00,2666,"Maybe to shake a hook fish will jump or seem to roll. Otherwise they are designed to stay upright. Dorsal fins, pelvic fins, etc... are there to maintain this balance. Basic high school biology shows that a fish needs to stay upright to maintain swim bladder and other vital organs.  Alligators do ""death rolls"". Fish may jump or appear to roll when hooked to save their lives.  Basic biology shows the need for fish to stay upright.  ""death rolls"" Geez...."
718198,bare foot wader,2012-07-27 06:15:00,1354," geeze, lots of biologists around here  I have personally witnessed pike grab my walleye on the stringer, head shake like crazy, keep the walleye in its mouth and roll, ripping the walleye's jaw open and swimming away  perhaps not an alligator death roll so the biologists can call it whatever you want, it didn't give up the walleye and rolled (white belly upside down in the water) and thrashed around until he got my fish  you've never had a musky leave a puncture wound on a fish???"
718245,smally21,2012-07-27 13:27:00,993,"in spite of basic biology fish don't explode when inverted, and seem to do so to get free of something, or to get a better purchase on something, or to rip something up...who hasn't seen a fish invert or shake or whatever...  there was no suggestion the musky hovered inverted the entire time  what do you call it when pike and musky get the line wrapped around them at the side of the boat..pretty sure the fish rolled around..i certainly didn't wrap the rod around it a half dozen times."
718263,dave524,2012-07-27 14:22:00,4508,"Not a turtle! I see individual punctures of teeth, any turtle I have seen don't have teeth but a sharp beak, they would grab and rip chunks but not leave individual teeth marks. Mink, otter fisher raccoon or possibly a fish but not a turtle."
718269,Gregoire,2012-07-27 14:42:00,1397,"  I don't know why this bugs me, maybe it is your know it all tone, but I have seen pike and musky roll multiple times. While I am not trained or educated as a biologist or otherwise I do watch a lot of swamp people and have caught a fair number of pike and musky in the past few years. In my mind the death roll that an alligator will do in an attempt to escape being caught is very similar to what a musky and pike will do. Instead of arguing semantics, and trying to prove that you are right and others are wrong you could admit that others can reasonably see things differently or that you may have been mistaken. Just my 2 cents."
718276,ehg,2012-07-27 15:21:00,2666,"Fish don't 'roll'. they do headshakes. They are designed to stay upright. After catching thousands, I would say 99.9999% came to net in normal upright position. Sure they did a headshake or jumped. If they rolled they came in belly up which was problematic.   Anything with teeth would have punctured the eyes of the walleye there, not squished them down."
718295,Gregoire,2012-07-27 16:28:00,1397," They all come in as you described. As they are fighting at the boat they will roll as they meet the resistance of the rod and line. As has been previously mentioned that is why they will get wrapped in the line occacionally and is one reason why many musky anglers prefer to use fluoro or mono leaders, as they will do less damage to a fish when they roll.  This is the last I will comment on this topic, as I realize that it is pointless to debate with someone who is never wrong in his mind. Believe what you want."
718300,grimsbylander,2012-07-27 16:52:00,3016,I'm thinking it's self inflicted wounds from a common walleye suicide attempt. All those years off living in fear of being eaten by a vicious predator and hiding out in dark thick weeds must be depressing. Only to end up on the end of a stringer facing certain death and a stick of melted butter. Just saying...
718308,cram,2012-07-27 17:38:00,1733,It was colonel mustard in the library with the wrench.   Still think it was a mink.
718325,cityfisher,2012-07-27 19:00:00,959,learned my lesson manny years ago... dont use stringers  snapping turtles and musky love an easy meal
718336,northernpike56,2012-07-27 19:38:00,717,"snapping turtles have stolen my fish 3 times.. from what ive noticed, they usaully go for the slim bodied fish first (had one take 1 small walleye off and only munched on 2 smallies I had on as well.., had one take a pike but leave the crappie, and the other one took a rainbow trout.) It really ticks me off, but now I usaully check my stringer every 15-30 minutes depending on where I'm fishing."
718340,crappieperchhunter,2012-07-27 19:52:00,2582, I have had mink/weasel take fish from me while I'm shore fishing and they are less then 3 feet away. If I had not been looking in that direction and seen the movement he would have got away scott free because he never made a sound. BTW it was a 10 inch perch and I was having a real good day so I just let him have it. Met up with him...I'm assuming the same one again...3 more times that fall and he came up to me and took fish everytime.
717898,Hooked,2012-07-26 02:41:00,891,"I came across some pics recently that I meant to post on here awhile ago.  Well I am finally getting around to actually posting them.  Anyways, these date back to last August.  I was on my annual vacation on Rice Lake.  I spent an evening of walleye fishing and came in around 9:00pm.  I had 2 walleye\pickerel on a chain stringer with clips, both 15"" in length.  I threw them over in the water expecting to clean them later that night.  Well 10:30pm rolls around so I bring my fillet knife down to clean them.  To my surprise there is only 1 on the stringer!  I'm like the what the.....I check the all the clips and they were closed.  Then I thought perhaps my brother took one, but quickly realized that didn't make any sense.  Then I get a good look at the one that is left.          I first noticed the fishes eye was collapsed, then I noticed the teeth marks on its belly, and finally the nice gashes on its back and head...at first I thought a snapping turtle, but quickly set that assumption aside.  It had to of been a Musky, there are no Pike in the lake.  It likely tried getting that one off and couldn't get it off the stringer, then tried for the other one and succeeded.  Or was really hungry and ate the first one then was too full to pull the other one off.   Man that would of been a site to watch, or even hear that stringer go nuts while it ripped it off."
717903,BillM,2012-07-26 02:48:00,17367,I'd still guess snapping turtle.
717904,dave524,2012-07-26 02:50:00,4508,I'm thinking a land animal like a coon or mink by the look of the teeth marks.
717909,Hooked,2012-07-26 02:56:00,891," It's possible for sure, but I've never had one take one off the stringer.  They've always left the head and parts of the body.  In retrospect, I guess there would be more teeth marks if it was a Musky?"
717918,Hooked,2012-07-26 03:21:00,891,Well there goes my awesome story I've been telling everyone for almost a year!
717919,GreenCanada,2012-07-26 03:23:00,375,Not surprised they got mauled. Free food left out for the taking.
717921,rufus,2012-07-26 03:30:00,267,I have had snapping turtles dine on my stringer a couple of times and they always eat the belly first and when they are done just the heads are left on the stringer.  They have never eaten the heads.
717929,ehg,2012-07-26 04:22:00,2666,"Yup, most definitely a snapper took it for dinner. Happened a couple of weeks ago to me in Algonquin with a big catfish. Snapper ripped it right of stringer and mostly consumed it within minutes before being witnessed."
717962,mike rousseau,2012-07-26 12:26:00,4661,I had that happen in a boat... I figured musky or pike....  On a dock is say turtle or animal...  I left a stringer of bullhead catfish hanging from the dock overnight... In the morning they were all gone and the stringer was out of the water laying on the dock... Just a few jaw bones left... I figured mink or coons did the damage... Those mink can be tough little critters...  One time I put a few walleye in a big water tank to clean in the morning... By morning they were all gone... And one was 4-5 pounds... There were 3-4 fish in there... Then we saw the little footprints and figured out it was the minks...
717966,jigsnreels,2012-07-26 12:41:00,133,Long story short - you had a light dinner...
717975,Hooked,2012-07-26 13:06:00,891," Wow, I can't believe those little guys took out a 4-5 lb'er.  That's crazy.  And clever on top of that too!  Cool story."
717987,Sherriff,2012-07-26 13:48:00,252,Definately a Sasquatch!  Did you happen to have any Jacks Link Beef jerky in your cottage?  Sherriff
717990,BillM,2012-07-26 14:03:00,17367, RICKY!!!!!!!
717993,mercman,2012-07-26 14:19:00,7054,  Still an awesome story though. Cool pics.
717996,cram,2012-07-26 14:27:00,1733,Mink or fisher or something.  A turtle eats it on the stringer. Doubt a musky gets both off your stringer. A mink or fisher would chew it off at the stringer and run away with it.
718017,Fisherpete,2012-07-26 16:01:00,1814,"My cottage is on Rice, seen it more times over the years than I care to remember... turtles.  Pete"

718023,BillM,2012-07-26 16:12:00,17367," Dude, the Rake-un episode was one of the funniest things I've ever watched..  "
718030,ehg,2012-07-26 16:40:00,2666,"Wrong.  Saw a snapping turtle rip a fish off stringer and consume it quickly just couple of weeks ago. Broke the jaw bones with mouth clamp then neck pulls.  Threw a whole chicken carcass later to it and completely ripped it to shreds. Their necks, jaws and legs are pure muscle."
718033,smally21,2012-07-26 17:23:00,993,"just a bad day to be a walleye. the only thing left out is to shock 'em with a car battery a few times.   a coworkers son showed us feeding time at the snapping turtle exhibit..eats a fullsize white rat, bit it in half like it was a Slim-Jim.  I think they could chomp a walleye to bits no problem. of course,  a raccoon is smart enought to unhook the stringer, remove the fish and hook it back up just to confound you.."
718077,bare foot wader,2012-07-26 20:22:00,1354,"musky/pike all the way  turtles are pure gluttons, a snapper would've taken both fish and very strong jaws, no problem pick pocketing a stringer  I've had walleye attacked many, many times on the stringer off the canoe, a pike or musky will attack it a few times, head shake and then realize they can't swim away with it and then do a death roll and rip the jaw open on the walleye  those teeth marks don't look like the work of a racoon or mink  cool story and pics"
718081,Hooked,2012-07-26 20:34:00,891," Hahaha, it wouldn't surprise me."
718093,crappieperchhunter,2012-07-26 21:12:00,2582," X2...I have seen it happen. Turtles are slower and more methodical, and I highly doubt that the fish left behind would have been banged up that much."
