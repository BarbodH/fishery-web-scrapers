717854,hotsky,2012-07-25 23:25:00,400,On lunch I had some free time so walked over to Canadian Tire to look at 12v battery chargers since I'll be buying by boat and trolling motor later this week.  Lucky for me they had one on sale 40% off for $49.99 (reg. $89.99). Figured cant go wrong for the price and picked one up the store only had one left. Anyone use them? How did I do?  http://www.canadiantire.ca/AST/browse/4/Auto/3/Batteries/BatteryChargers/PRD~0111518P/MotoMaster+Eliminator+Intelligent+Battery+Charger+12%2B8%2B2A.jsp?locale=en
717856,Default User,2012-07-25 23:29:00,72,I think it's time to cash in some Canadian Tire money LOL
717859,Woodsman,2012-07-25 23:42:00,1286,I have a friend who has one & really likes it. I'll have to see if I can get one also.
717867,DRIFTER_016,2012-07-26 00:04:00,10439,I have one and have no complaints. I don't use it for my boat though as I have an onboard charger for that.

717917,Toad Hunter,2012-07-26 03:14:00,261,"thanx for the post, will be looking to pick one up tomorrow now"
717932,i2cool2fool,2012-07-26 05:24:00,349,I have one and use it on my boat all the time. Works great.
717936,davey buoy,2012-07-26 08:11:00,5505,The price is sure right.
717937,registerfly,2012-07-26 08:59:00,198,I have the same one and works great on my battery. Over a yr plus. Just set it on auto and you are set.
718012,cityfisher,2012-07-26 15:32:00,959,got one works great...now i got an onboard charger... much better
718050,jedimaster,2012-07-26 18:25:00,3472,"I have that one, and although its automatic it never will read charged until you unplug it and plug it back in. Have returned it twice. the MFG said thats how they are."
718060,EC1,2012-07-26 19:31:00,930,"  To be honest, I don't like this charger one bit. Reads ""Low"" the whole time while you're charging it (Even if you put a battery with 70% it still reads low). Doesn't know when to stop charging batteries.  Cooked 2 batteries in the last little while because of that."
718097,Garnet,2012-07-26 21:41:00,2056,If that's a new boat I would get on board charger. If it's not I still would get on board charger.
