718040,Oryx,2012-07-26 17:42:00,186,"For a fathers day gift, I was charged with the task of choosing my own present.  I decided on a Frabill Hiber-net. http://frabill.com/landing-nets/hiber-net-collapse-net/hiber-net.html As the boat I fish from, has limited room, i thought it was a great idea that the netting stored back into the handle. Problem is, after using it a couple times, it is a hook magnet.  Nothing like spending 20 mins to get a treble out, I was thinking of getting a rubberizing spray and blasting the nylon.....but not sure if this would harm the fish, or make the net to stiff to use.  Any thoughts would be appreciated."
718045,smally21,2012-07-26 17:59:00,993,"Hmmm, never thought of such a thing. my first guess is that next to nothing sticks to nylon.."
718047,jedimaster,2012-07-26 18:23:00,3472,I doubt it would be too stiff. It may peel off but when you leave it to dry just make sure its in a good shape. that may be the only shape it stays in.
718051,fishnsled,2012-07-26 18:34:00,3520,"I would think it may make the net too stiff to pull back into the handle. I got one of the the Conservation Series nets last year and love it. The mesh is rubber coated and the handle (telescopic) collapses down into the hoop for easy storage. (Not as compact as the one you have.) I guess you could try spraying you mesh and if it doesn't work, just buy a replacement for it.  Edit - or just by a rubber coated mesh and see if it works. Replacement Netting."

718063,Oryx,2012-07-26 19:46:00,186,  I was thinking of cutting his line as my buddy was reeling in this beaut.....he gets quite the swollen ego when he catches anything of size. 
718064,cram,2012-07-26 19:46:00,1733,Just buy a replacement mesh that has a good coating.
718065,SlowPoke,2012-07-26 19:50:00,2984,The hooks will still tangle in coated mesh(beckman in my case). I always have a good assortment of hooks on hand and just cut them if I can't remove them in a short period of time. You can buy a lot of hooks for the price of a replacement net.
718121,Ralph Field,2012-07-26 22:59:00,1018,If you want to be able to close the net I think I would follow Slowpoke's advise and buy extra hooks. If you buy a replacement net I doubt that your net will work as intended.
718128,Rizzo,2012-07-26 23:59:00,4754,"Have a second rod nearby. I caught a musky last night, getting the hooks out of the net took me longer than getting them out of the fish. I bet it took 10 minutes (but felt longer)...so I fired up the motor and did some open water trolling with rod 2 while trying to get #1 untangled. ""Fortunately"" I didn't get another fish while still tangled...would have been hand-bombing that one!"
