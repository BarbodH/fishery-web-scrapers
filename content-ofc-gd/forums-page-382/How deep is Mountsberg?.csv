717930,hotsky,2012-07-26 04:34:00,400,I'm hoping guys with sonars can tell me how deep the Moutsberg reservoir is (not including the weeds on the bottom  )  avg and deepest spots.
717958,Fish4Eyes,2012-07-26 12:23:00,1022,Not deep at all. Deepest I found was like 8-9'. Most areas are 4-7' if you are away from the shoreline.
717977,Acountdeleted,2012-07-26 13:11:00,2562,Can't be deeper then 10 feet. Most spots I can put my paddle down to the bottom.
717989,d_paluch,2012-07-26 13:57:00,343,This year with this heat you'd probably be hard pressed to find anything over 6'. Water levels are WAY down compared to last year. Still a fun lake until the weeds took over
718084,Default User,2012-07-26 20:40:00,72,anybody have pics of Mountsberg?  is it often crowded on weekends?
718173,ld17,2012-07-27 02:36:00,319,for pics just google map it.  There is a ton of weed there.  Low water levels.  If your in a boat ( electric only ) it won't be crowded.  If you want to catch snot rockets go there.  Anything else do yourself a favour and find another lake.
718183,hotsky,2012-07-27 03:07:00,400,"Alright thanks guys, that's kinda what I thought. That's perfect for a inflatable with a trolling motor!"
718196,d_paluch,2012-07-27 05:38:00,343,There are some near 5lbers largies in there...I might have proof  Pm for pics if you'd like
718332,lovetofish,2012-07-27 19:31:00,500,"I used to love mountsberg, now theres garbage everywhere and it stinks! last time I was there 8 out of 10 guys were using live bait! Its ok from a boat because you don't have to put up with these things. I used to really enjoy pike fishing there. My pb pike is still from there"
718334,northernpike56,2012-07-27 19:34:00,717,"I've heard 8ft deep from multiple people, but havnt brought a sonar on it myself."
