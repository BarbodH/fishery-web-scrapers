718329,Twocoda,2012-07-27 19:14:00,4130,Depends on whether your going to leave the boat in the water all season or not...different options as you will find out on your calling quest
718364,Skipper D,2012-07-27 22:24:00,1970,"Thats right TWOCODY and i did , first off its to bad it just could'nt be left alone with its jelcoat finish , but times taken its toll on it , i'd like to see it looking new again and in order to see that happen its paint it time . For as long as own it , the boat will always be trailered , never left in the water , so several places today suggested for that reason i use Polyurathaine , guess thats what i'll use unless some comes along with a better idea ."

The prep work is the most important part. When you think you are done sanding, start over and sand again, repeat at least three times...."
718429,Skipper D,2012-07-28 11:21:00,1970,"  Guess i am on the right trac with the polyurethane thing , never having worked with f/g that much , i was told to sand it with 400 and bought a case ."
