718496,mike rousseau,2012-07-28 21:37:00,4661,Got out early today as well as yesterday.... Trying to get ready for a walleye tourney next weekend...  And this morning I caught a pike... It was about 6-7 pounds... This may not sound interesting but in my area I dont see very many pike.... This is my first pike this year on my home water...  Believe it or not I only get 1 or 2 a year fishing walleye and musky....  There is good pike fishing in the spring... But after that they kinda disappear.....    
718497,Roy,2012-07-28 21:56:00,13728,That's a decent one Mike. In almost 60 years of fishing both the Larry and the Ottawa I think the biggest I've gotten was about 10 pounds. I never did understand why......nor have I tried to find out really. It might be because pike are not the top of the chain here. Muskie gets big but muskie is a warm water fish where pike is a colder water fish. Maybe that's the answer. I went out today mainly to sit in the sun and it showed...I came home around 3:30 with two white stripes on my back. Spent most of my time pulling fat baits through skinny water.  Not a smart move today.
718498,mike rousseau,2012-07-28 22:34:00,4661,  But above the dam here there's plenty... And big too....  The spring tourney usually gets pike over 15 pounds....

718525,Beans,2012-07-29 02:41:00,3339, I heard they lose their teeth during the warm water...  N'est pas ?   
718527,BillM,2012-07-29 02:58:00,17367,They always have teeth
