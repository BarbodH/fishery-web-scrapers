718256,hookerdown,2012-07-27 13:56:00,110,"Depending on the number of people going.  If you are looking at 3 people of less, call Gavin (GMAN) at GetBit Sport Fishing http://getbit.ca/.  I have known Gavin for about 14 years and he lives to fish.  Always produces good numbers and sizes too.  If you are looking to bring a kid along, then go with Gavin.  For a larger group go with either Wayne Andrews (Andrew's Charters 416-347-2143).  Wayne has been chartering on Lake O for over 25 years and always gets into fish.  I have been on his boat a few times and is always fun. He will put you into numbers for sure.   Dave from Fish ON Charters (416-931-1836) is pretty good too.  He has been really giving the salmon a pounding this year.  I have talked to him a few times at PC after fishing and while most guys are struggling to get a few, he manages to dial in the fish.  He is also more then willing to share his knowledge too.  All 3 operations are pretty involved in the Fishery too.  Wayne is a Director and one of the founders of the Port Credit Salmon and Trout Association (PCSTA).  Dave is a member of PCSTA as well and has helped out the club with more than a few activities.  Gavin is a member of a few clubs, including PCSTA and Straightline Anglers, he participates in several tournies every year and normally places in the top 5.  He finished 1st or 2nd last weekend."
