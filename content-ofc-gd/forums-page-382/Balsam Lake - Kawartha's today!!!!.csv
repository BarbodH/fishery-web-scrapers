We decided to hit Balsam today for a mixed bag and were very successful at our quest!!  We worked inside weedlines in rock and weed areas in 5 to 10' of water using tubes, jerkbaits and jig/n pigs and got into a number of great fish!!.. was really surprised given all the thunder storms and rain yesterday and the N.E. winds and blue sunny skies today.  Attached a pic of my son Mitch with a couple of nice Balsam fish.... wish it was a tournament today cause we really got into some big fish!!    Take care and see you on the water... Greg."
