So I walk up to the stairs to get down on the grass to have a closer look when from the corner of my eye, catch this standing still      Here's a closer shot        Now that I know what the parents were trying to do, decided to leave the chick alone and went inside... 15 minutes later, I go back out to check on the chick and to my surprise... there's 2 now        So now I'm really scratching my head as to what to do with these 2... I go inside and go online, Google to see what can be done to save them and to my surprise, I found something  Here's the link Caring for Baby Birds...  Here's an excerpt of what it recommended I do  *****Quote: Uninjured Baby Birds  If you find an uninjured young bird you will need to determine whether or not it is really an orphaned bird. The best way is to determine if it is a nestling or a fledgling. Most young birds that are found are really just young fledglings that can't fly well....  In order to determine whether the bird is a nestling or a fledgling allow the baby bird to perch on your finger. If it is able to grip your finger firmly than it is a fledgling.  The best thing to do in this case is to place it in a nearby tree or shrub and leave it alone. The parents will continue to care and feed it on their own.... *****Unquote  So I did and determine that these 2 were fledgling, so I immediately place them back into the tree where the nest was and left them alone   But before I did, snapped this shot of one on my finger  Cute little guy     Now my good deed is done for the day and feel they have a better chance at getting fed & care from the parents Tight lines TJunkie"

The eggs never hatched  There was really nothing I could do for them, unless I bought an incubator, but really, did I want more grackles in my life or in my home.  The answer was no.  Even tho it sucked they abandoned the nest, I guess that is life!"

717808,fishnsled,2012-07-25 20:28:00,3520,Good on ya Jacques!  Had the same experience earlier this year with a sparrow fledgling. The little guy had gotten into my boat shelter and seemed all disoriented. Put my finger down and he hopped onto it and I moved him back close to the nest. Left him alone for a while and soon he was chirping with the parents.  Was getting dark and I guess it was to exhausted to move at all and I'm pretty sure spent the night where I left it. In the morning no fledgling to be seen. Since I didn't see a scattering of feathers I'm assuming that the neighbourhood cats didn't get it and that he was reunited with his parents.
