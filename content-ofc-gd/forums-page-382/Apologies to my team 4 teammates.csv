717922,Bob,2012-07-26 03:31:00,370,"A month ago, I took my lady, my best friend to hospital and the diagnosis was pneumonia. She seemed to be improving for a couple of days but then she had a spell where she couldn't breathe. Ventilator, sedation and chopper flight to the Sault Area Hospital, much better, much newer facility. Cat-scan discovers Hodgkins Lymphoma. She's still hanging in there, has had a trachaeostomy and the doc is still confident they can knock this bug down. If they succeed, there'll be chemo and all kinds of hardships. Consequently, I'm not spending my time on the lake but travelling back and forth from here to the Sault. Sorry guys."
