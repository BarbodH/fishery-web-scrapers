WALLEYES  
717149,capt_hooked,2012-07-23 15:36:00,212,"I got a true pickerel once (acturally two of them).. in a small lake near the French River... It looked like a short, fat pike... same thing... but different.. and totally different bone structure... when filleted... and the taste was incredible..!  I have never seen another pickerel since and only occasionally have I met someone who has ever caught a pickerel.  Although lots of local people claim they do.... every day....  Out west.. they call northen pike.. ""jack"" and in Carolina... they have a small pike they also call ""jack"".   But I figure most of us don't know jack...!  "
717165,Fish Farmer,2012-07-23 16:31:00,2234,"I know Jack, he is a good friend of mine."
717211,Billy Bob,2012-07-23 19:10:00,5865, REAL PICKEREL ...see the 3 fish in the middle.....  
717282,dave524,2012-07-23 22:00:00,4508,"We actually got real pickerel here too, as a kid we sometimes got what my dad called grass pike in the Welland river back in the 60's, looking now I'm pretty sure they were these guys, they were different from the normal pike we caught both in colour and shape. Anyone down Erie way seen any lately?  http://publications.gc.ca/collections/Collection/CW69-14-436-2005E.pdf"
717286,dave524,2012-07-23 22:04:00,4508, Your wife says otherwise
717407,capt_hooked,2012-07-24 11:33:00,212,   ah ha..!  great pic...!
717490,Fish Farmer,2012-07-24 16:41:00,2234,Article is in this morning Spec
717493,Spiel,2012-07-24 16:49:00,9065," Yep, here's the link.  http://www.thespec.com/news/local/article/766639--walleye-in-harbour-seen-as-positive-sign"
717497,Billy Bob,2012-07-24 17:04:00,5865," But at that size they are barely bigger then fry.......and their survival rate will be VERY low.....  Oneida Lake in Central NYS has a hatchery right across the street from the lake.....they have been for years stocking fry in that lake....100 MILLION each and every year with the hopes of a 1% return. However, in recent years they have now been raising some of the walleyes to fingerlings as they have a MUCH better survival rate.  http://www.dec.ny.gov/outdoor/21666.html  More hatchery info......  http://www.dec.ny.gov/outdoor/7742.html"
717503,Spiel,2012-07-24 17:13:00,9065," I agree whole heartedly. At that size and knowing the area well I suspect most will end up in the bellies of young perch, sunfish and rock bass that are numerous there."
717695,pikehunter,2012-07-25 10:21:00,1659," Exactly, fish names are a regional thing, that's my point. We are all right, well at least to a point as they are really called PICKEREL!  Agree with you Siel that it is a shame most will end up in the line at the buffet table for the bigger fish. I suppose though the best will survive and with so many fishing folks not keeping bay fish for the table we can only hope that the few remaining will end up growing up to be large breeders...and just think of it this way, those offspring will enjoy the benefits of having 3 eyes and multiple fins!  Nice variety catch there Billy....especially the pickerel. Enjoyed the photo."
717974,capt_hooked,2012-07-26 13:06:00,212,  Thanks for the links.....  
718412,northernpike56,2012-07-28 02:26:00,717,"when I was in grade 7 or 8 I saw a guy catch a 6 pound walleye from lasalle. me and my friend actually netted it for him, then netted a huge bass a guy caught with his daughter a few minutes later. I would think that walleye was a stocked fish, but we never looked for any tags or anything. So there could be a few walleye that will survive to grow that big as well."
716108,lew,2012-07-19 17:20:00,12766," At one time in Ontario, loooong before you were born, they were ALWAYS called pickeral and walleye was a term only used by Americans.  Your right though Stoty, pickeral isn't the proper name for them but for 1000's of folks, ...mostly older and me included...pickeral is still the name of them and always will be."
716117,dave524,2012-07-19 17:41:00,4508," http://www.ontariowalleyefishing.com/walleye-biology.html  The name walleye was chosen by some think tank in 1933, my dad called them yellow and blue pickeral in Lake Erie since he predated that , the Americans on Erie called them yellow and blue pike from what I remember in the 50's."
716119,Christopheraaron,2012-07-19 17:44:00,3525, actually walleye are yellow pickeral and the pike like fish are chain pickeral.
716125,ehg,2012-07-19 17:53:00,2666," Back 20 yrs. ago + they were officially referred to as "" yellow pickeral"" in all MNR literature. Only since the term walleye has been used in Canada.  Anyways, any attempt at stocking them in Lake Ontario is good despite whatever. They are native to the lake and could thrive if industry cleaned up. Apparently they spawn on wind blown shallow rock shoals not up rivers.  The big walleye/yellow pickeral in my avatar was caught in northwest Lake Ontario. Always thought a world record sized one would come out of there."
716136,GreenCanada,2012-07-19 18:30:00,375,"I had heard a few years ago that the rock islands near the Skyway (with the seagulls and cormorants) were going to be ""redesigned"". Basically the islands were going to be lengthened and narrowed so that they would be below the water surface and the birds would not have a place to roost or land. I think the intention was going to be the creation of more smallmouth bass habitat in that particular area.  I haven't seen any movement on that front and my discussions with some ppl knowledgeable to the discussions don't have any update really. I just don't understand why such an obvious problem isn't being addressed to some degree...."
716178,Rich,2012-07-19 20:09:00,3927,I think the trout/salmon migrating in will probably make quicker work of them than pollution or birds.
716179,Rich,2012-07-19 20:13:00,3927," There were not near as many gobies back them , maybe the fact that food is plentiful now may help is the idea behind it? I personally love the musky idea though. Wish i could catch them close to home."
716193,misfish,2012-07-19 20:52:00,29133,"  All I know Lew is,when I say pop,want to go pickeral fishing.he knows what I,m talking about."
716195,porkpie,2012-07-19 20:58:00,2521,  What is a walleye sonny????
716380,Fish Farmer,2012-07-20 13:02:00,2234,"When were gone Lew, the youngins can have their way, but old sounds good to me to. Just like the new phrase Drop Shotting (Pickeral rig) or (Perch setup).  Right on buddy"
716384,Fish Farmer,2012-07-20 13:10:00,2234,Good one
716399,kickingfrog,2012-07-20 13:57:00,8333,When my dad worked for lands and forests (now MNR) he helped with some of Richard Ryder's walleye research. So in the 1960's the term walleye was being used by some people in Canada.
716401,Rich,2012-07-20 13:59:00,3927,I saw pictures of people in the 40's and 50's holding stringers or 20 - 30 muskies at a time proudly.. Does that mean THEY were right too?
716411,Rich,2012-07-20 14:19:00,3927,I think they called them silver pike.. Lmao
716451,lew,2012-07-20 15:57:00,12766,"  Nope, but they were well fed"
716606,capt_hooked,2012-07-20 22:31:00,212,"We have been stocking young walleye on the West Arm of Lake Nipissing for some 25 years now.  The size of fish shown in the top picture of this post is normal for fingerlings.... soon after they reach that length (2-inches) they start to cannibalize themselves and must be released prior to that event.  We have released an average of 20,000 fingerlings at this end of Nipissing each year and the MNR fall Index Netting Studies show an average of 25% more fish from the nets tests in the West Arm, compared to netting studies from the rest of Nipissing. This I believe is a strong indication of the success of our stocking program.   There is nothing ""natural"" about sport fishing, commercial fishing and ice fishing... When we take out more fish than the lake can reproduce naturally then we need to either stop fishing (what?) or put back in what we took out.  The yellow walleye was introduced to Lake Nipissing in the early 1920s and was never ""natural"" to this lake.  Tight Lines...  the cap't   "
716756,Snidley,2012-07-21 19:01:00,620,"Bravo Capt Hooked. It should be obvious to all but either limiting catches substantially or stocking to make up for the mortality of kept fish are  the only way to maintain a good fishery. Unfortunately the MNR seems to think that a hands off approach to stocking and law enforcement will work and , like virtually everything government, they are wrong, wrong wrong."
716757,kickingfrog,2012-07-21 19:36:00,8333,And now that mnr budget has been reduced by 70 million dollars I'm sure it will get better.
717099,pikehunter,2012-07-23 09:38:00,1659," With no offence to the U.S born folks around here this could be taken as part of the American invasion of the north. The incident of 1812 still lives on! They couldn't take the north by force so they bought their way in by purchasing our brand names. Home Depot bought Atkinheads, Walmart bought Woolco, Best Buy bought Future Shop, Banana Republic, the Gap, Business Depot, Office Depot, Dollar Tree, U.S Steel buys STELCO, Target buys Zellers (they were much the same anyway with nothing I want to buy) Lowes and now Lowes is attempting to buy Rona! And think of this, every auto manufacturer except for offshore is U.S owned.  Then to slap Canadians in the face with a fish tale they rename our sacred pickeral WALLEYE!!! How dare they do that to us!  Stand up! Raise your maple leaf! And declare that ""I AM Canadian! The fish is not called Walleye! It is a Pickeral! And may it roam our waters strong and FREE!""  Now, may I appologize, I have an excuss for this as I have been awake since 3AM and can't sleep, I am a tired old soul...  Edit: Don't forget Bass Pro Shops..."
717100,Roy,2012-07-23 09:47:00,13728,"It would be even less confusing if people learned how to spell the word. If you're going to be obstinate enough to use the wrong word, at least spell it correctly. PICKEREL!"
717106,pikehunter,2012-07-23 10:50:00,1659,"Well now, slap me in the kisser with a fish! I shall now stand corrected. The fish will now be called PICKEREL!"
717107,Fish Farmer,2012-07-23 11:05:00,2234,"Nothing against the U.S. Right on Harry, and we still see line-ups going over the border to shop on the holidays  Won't be long before we see the flag change. I was at a resort up north in June that fly a half&half flag,CA/US, never thought that was legal, but it was probably made in ? I don't even see why we have a border. Give it time, we are sheep in foreign made clothing. We must get laughed at a lot down south with our leaders, just for starters the hydro 190 million dollar boondoggle us tax payers have to pay for. And the man stands up and says it's was his fault and says I'm sorry. And that makes it OK Our U.S. OFC'ers that haven't seen it in your comedy sections in your paper, I just gave you your morning smile."

717110,grimsbylander,2012-07-23 11:26:00,3016,Wouldn't it be great if nothing ever changed like the good old days?
717114,Billy Bob,2012-07-23 11:54:00,5865,"Not called walleyes in Buffalo, NY, USA but rather YELLOW PIKE....hope that makes you feel a little bit better...."
715612,Fish Farmer,2012-07-18 03:30:00,2234,"There will be a media release sent to the local papers (including the Spec) that the MNR will send out shortly. July 5 and 6 the MNR stocked 100,000 walleye into the Bay. BARC members and other Fisheries and Bay stakeholders. Watch the Spec for an article.         Sorry for the small pictures but thats all I had"
715613,Live2fish85,2012-07-18 03:35:00,1633,Kind of a waste of a good fish lol.
715619,Musky or Specks,2012-07-18 03:54:00,2710,I remember when we use to transfer pike from the Grand to the harbour trying to keep the sucker and carp population in check. Maybe this means they feel that that has finally happened.
715620,danc,2012-07-18 03:55:00,4677,"Good news I suppose. Personally I support the ""clean the place up, build/protect new spawning areas, change the laws to protect what's there now, and let nature do it's thing"" theory. That would be a success story imho. I just was never a big fan of stalking fish. To me, it's like throwing in the towel."
715622,solopaddler,2012-07-18 04:05:00,8605,"As a Hamiltonian it's nice to see.  But seriously, those fish will never be edible. What else are walleye good for?  Hopefully they eliminate the massive cormorant population before the stocking. Doubt it though."
715627,hotsky,2012-07-18 04:39:00,400,"Cool, maybe I'll fish the Harbour more often."
715648,Fish Farmer,2012-07-18 11:08:00,2234,"Was my thought as well. The amount of sewage thats dumped in the bay and other, why waste good fish. The size got me. Maybe there trying to feed the other fish"
715651,Live2fish85,2012-07-18 11:27:00,1633," I agree with trying to feed other fish. They won't last long with all the pike in there. As much as it will be nice, just pointless. I guess there are some of the crazy ones that will eat the fish out of there."
715656,smally21,2012-07-18 12:02:00,993,"I don't really know how walleye act when inserted, but they don't have shock collars on.  Do they just hang in the area that were entered in? Eating gobies and taking shade in the algae bloom? Is it possible they will just make a run for Lake Ontario??  Just pack their things and head to Niagara Falls or Toronto or something??  I had heard a while back about a huge walleye release in the Grimsby area into Lake O. Anyone have an idea?"
715658,Harrison,2012-07-18 12:06:00,2202,"Should name them Pickeral in the article, 2/3's of the readers have no idea what a walleye is."
715659,Live2fish85,2012-07-18 12:07:00,1633,"Last year I think it was, there was a good sized walleye caught in the harbour. It was posted here I think."
715668,pikehunter,2012-07-18 12:34:00,1659,Wonder if they will behave like lower Grand R. walleye. Spend time in the lake when the water gets too warm and head back into the harbour in the fall? In that case they will have spent a little time in water that is somewhat less polluted.
715706,bucktail,2012-07-18 14:18:00,1857,"They didnt learn from the first time they did this???? The fish simply left, I dont think a single fish was ever caught from the first time they stocked eyes in there. What a complete waste of money and time!  They should put 10,000 fingerling muskies in there to help clean up the rough fish population and then you may have a fun catch and release ( not consume ) fishery.  Darren"
715714,Steve,2012-07-18 14:32:00,2075,"bucktail - you are correct.  this has been done before.  (I was fortunate enough to catch ""one"" in 2004, a product of the first stocking attempt, but overall ....)  I think it should be some good bass bait until they are all eaten."
715717,craigdritchie,2012-07-18 14:34:00,1586,"I think it's a great move, and I do hope a handful of them will survive to start eating the gobies that have pretty much taken over.  Unfortunately, deep down I think they're just expensive bird food. The cormorants in that area truly are out of control."
715727,jedimaster,2012-07-18 15:01:00,3472,"Wow they stock fish that small? I thought they would all be yearlings or something. Kinda cool I guess, but I am with others that cleaning up that toilet tank would be a better idea. Maybe they will make the cormorants taste good."
715732,Sherriff,2012-07-18 15:21:00,252,"Great news.  Hope they survive, stick around and end up being like Quinte sized walleye!  Really hope to see the harbour delisted in my lifetime.  Great work done so far by BARC and the City to help clean up the bay!  Sherriff"
715829,GreenCanada,2012-07-18 20:08:00,375,"Those sure are some small walleye. I'm glad to see that people haven't given up on HH!  Where is all this ""sewage"" coming from that people mentioned?  The treated wastewater effluent from both the Skyway Wastewater treatment plant and Woodward Ave wastewater treatment plant both contain less suspended sediment and pathogens than many rivers that flow into the Great Lakes. Additionally, the combined sewers that discharged untreated storm and sanitary effluent during heavy rain events have had storage tanks added that prevent nearly all these infrequent events.  So, I wouldn't necessarily say that Hamilton Harbour is the way it is because of sewage. I would say that it is the way it is partially because of the high density of industrial processes occurring on the banks of the bay. I could be wrong, but this is just my observation from years of research I've conducted on the subject. As part of my research I have also been developing a novel technology to address this very issue in collaboration with various government agencies and a NGO."
715857,fishindude,2012-07-18 21:34:00,220, x2  You can't imagine the frustration in me every time I'm driving south over the Skyway and look over on the right to see the army of these useless birds.
715942,Sherriff,2012-07-19 02:12:00,252," The bay has had a bad history so Some must think that they are constantly dumping crap into the bay without a care in the world like a 100 years ago.  The cso tanks are helping for sure and I understand that the treated wastewater is put back into the lake cleaner than before it was taken..  Good news for the bay and lake O.  Again, it's great to see.  Sherriff"
715944,John Bacon,2012-07-19 02:21:00,3277,What is the temperature in Hamilton Harbour right now? I would think that is too warm for stocking fish.
715949,Live2fish85,2012-07-19 03:01:00,1633,Not that warm. The bays on Erie right now are 74 on average. And Lake Ontario doesn't heat up that quick. The bay included.
715971,Rich,2012-07-19 10:29:00,3927,"Sweet. Since most people are apt not to keep hammer fish, they might actually repopulate, unlike the completely decimated inner long point bay walleye population that will never return."
716085,uglyfish,2012-07-19 16:12:00,981,"Last tuesday the bay water temps were low 80's on average.  And the water there isn't as bad as most ppl make it out to be. There is a healthy fish population there, and walleye could thrive down there given the chance. Proof the water isn't so bad, smallmouth bass reside in there, smallmouth won't live in heavily polluted waters."
716095,Stoty,2012-07-19 16:39:00,2910," That drives me nuts.... whoever nicknamed them ""Pickeral"" in the first place needs to take up a different hobby!  A Walleye is a Walleye... a Pickeral is a Pickeral...."
