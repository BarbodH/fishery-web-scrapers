718328,Twocoda,2012-07-27 19:09:00,4130,Watsons in Owen Sound....you might want to look into your units...they have a life time warranty...i had one unit go down three times during a derby and Ford (president) asked me where i was as i was on my way to Owen Sound for repairs and he said to stop in Underwood at Huron Rod and Gun and told them over the phone to replace it ....GREAT service! The issue i had with mine was due to a fualty gear that kept chewing up a worm gear in the mechanics....they were too fast for their own good...but the problem was recognized and corrected ...Never had anothe issue in almost ten years now
