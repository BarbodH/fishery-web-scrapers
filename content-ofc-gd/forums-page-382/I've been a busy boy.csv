Despite the drought, I'm experiencing bumper crops.         And summer means canning season.    By the by,     Casey is full size now. All of 10 lbs.   I may be busy, but it sure is fun."
717820,crappieperchhunter,2012-07-25 20:54:00,2582,It all looks good Bruce .  You definitely have a green thumb  BTW I just pulled up the first garlic bulb from the garlic you gave me last fall to grow. I used it along with some of my fresh basil and fresh tomatoes and we made an awesome Bruschetta  Since you have it all figured out...when and how do you suggest I harvest/store my garlic crop?

717916,GreenCanada,2012-07-26 03:09:00,375,Looks amazing! My dad planted about 1000 garlic bulbs (multiple varieties I've acquired for him) near where he plans on crossbow hunting this fall. I'm a garlic-aholic and can't wait until he starts to pull them!
717934,bigugli,2012-07-26 07:30:00,6138,"My garlic was already harvested back in June, but there is no set date.  You should pull the garlic once the leaves have 1/2 turned brown, quickly rinse off any loose dirt, and let them dry for a couple of days. You can store them with the stalk on or off."
717938,crappieperchhunter,2012-07-26 09:36:00,2582, Thx Bruce. I was waiting until the tops had all died down   I'll try to remember your advise for next year. I'll get them harvested next week sometime and save the best ones for planting this fall for next years crop.
