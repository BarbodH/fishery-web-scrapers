My day started out great at 6am, first cast I caught a 3.5lb large mouth, hours later I caught a 2lb smallie around the same time my friend caught a 5lb large mouth. I fished the whole day leaving at 7pm. It was my first time fishing sparrow and over all I was not that impressed, I dont think I'll be going back to that lake anytime soon. I hope you have better luck than me, I look forward to your report.   A bad day fishing is still better than a good day at work."
