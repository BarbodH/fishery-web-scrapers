Had one fish follow in my lure and strike within about 10ft of the shore, unfortunately it came of so I have no idea what it was.  Another fish followed me in a few casts later, but I couldn't get him to commit.  I had very limited tackle up there(small spinners and stuff for stream trout) but I really would have liked to at least ID what kind of fish they were.  Each looked to be around 5 or 6lbs, and I think that they looked like some sort of salmon or trout. There was a pretty stiff wind blowing into shore that day, that was the only reason I was even throwing the Sonar: my other gear was almost to light to cast!"
