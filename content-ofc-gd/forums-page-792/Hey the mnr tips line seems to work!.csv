I spoke to a younger guy and he asked for licence plates numbers and location and it appears that someone is supposedly on their way to check it out.   I asked for a call back so I can know if it turned out good or not."

379947,Victor,2009-09-04 21:09:00,1609,1-877-TIPS-MNR (1-877-847-7667) i have it saved in my cell.
379948,Mattitude,2009-09-04 21:10:00,155,Its 1-877-847-7667.  I'm off to work but I hope to hear something tonight or tomorrow.  I also let them know that being the long weekend I am positive that there will be people there all week end and that they could probably check every day and probably check and see or find a violation every time.  BTW I also saw a family in a blow up boat and there had to be about six of them in it with no PFDs and it was in a very high traffic area.  Not cool.  I figure I'm just gonna call everytime I see something and maybe something will get done now.
