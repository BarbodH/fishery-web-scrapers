Hers a crazy pic of Marko at our all night carp adventure at peer 4 in hamilton    This is a nice carp I caught at the Bayfront tournament in Hamilton to bad i wasn't in the tourny   now i got some some pictures from a really carp fishing spot the fish are generally smaller then Hamilton but the action sometimes is just none stop again thank you Marko for showing me this sweet little honey hole   I dont know what happened to this guy but it looks like he had a head on collision   This is an average carp for the area   do I look excited enough the action is just great   heres a nice one the wife got but she wont hold the fish but at least she like to go once in a while   Hers a beast the young one got this guy almost pulled a rod in   another beast for the area   another carp out of the nice little hole   more fish to come soon
