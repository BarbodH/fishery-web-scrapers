379828,huey graphite,2009-09-04 14:36:00,362,Anyone know if there is a run of salmon started yet. I am in this area most often in the summer and have never fished the fall salmon run. I'm going to be there for the long weekend and just wondering if now is the time. If not in the river then perhaps off the peir at the mouth.   Thanks in advance!  HG
