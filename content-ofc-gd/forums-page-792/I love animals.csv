379425,BITEME,2009-09-03 13:54:00,1968,Its not an animal its a cat.....expendible!

379804,blaque,2009-09-04 13:41:00,2419,so your ticked at the cat for being sick? im confused
379809,bubbles,2009-09-04 13:54:00,591," Not at all, it's becasue it's a cat"
379830,blaque,2009-09-04 14:41:00,2419,"Hey?, cats are people too, errrr..........wait a minute."
379838,blaque,2009-09-04 14:53:00,2419,"I gotta say i dont get this disrespect for the cat. I mean, they leave you alone for the most part , they are low maintenance, they cripe in a sandbox and even cover it up. They dont go out frollicking in the mud and bring footprints through the house. They never stink like an old wet dog.......i could go on. But i dont understand it, it actually gets a little overboard at times.  I once overheard a visitor at my home say that ""this cat"" (my cat) ""better get away from me (actually he called her a little rat) or im gonna kick it thru a window"". I promptly grabbed him by his collar and announced to him at very close quarters.....that if he lays a toenail on my animal, Ill be giving him a face wash in ""the little rats"" piss box. Apologies ensued"
379844,Lunker777,2009-09-04 15:05:00,866," I must admit.... I was never a cat person ! I HATED them.... I was never mean to them... but I just never thought I would have one as a pet.  Well, One cold november night, we had a customer drop off a combine at the shop here ... it was about an hour drive or so in the combine.... well when we opened the side sheilds... there was this little kitten on the chassis of the combine. I grabbed her up and she was the nicest cat I have ever seen ! I promptly brought her home... well I shouldnt say that... I took her for a ride with me to a customers before I went home... thats where she decided to poop in my truck ! But I understood.... she had been through alot. hahah Stopped at wally world and grabbed a litter box, food dish, shampoo, and some food on the way home. As soon as we got in, I tossed her in the litter box... she sniffed around and to this day, she has been the best pet EVER !!! Not one accident...un like a dog that probably would have crapped and pee'd all over the place by now.  She did fall out of the window one night while we were sleeping.... oh ya, I live on the 4th floor of my apartment....  After looking for about 2 hours for her, I found her, she was good to go, just a little scared. hahahah If a dog were to fall that far, pretty sure I would be looking for a new pet.  All in all.... I gotta say, I love MY cat.... don't know about any one elses ! haha  Oh ya.... dont get mad at something for getting sick.... do people get tickets with you when you get a cold ???? Deal with it, its a living animal !"
379879,blaque,2009-09-04 16:40:00,2419,I was hoping to come back to a feel good story........good for you Lunker
379884,NAW,2009-09-04 17:19:00,4022,"I'm not a cat person….  Even though I have owned several growing up.  If someone dropped off a sick cat at my house, and expected me to adopt it, and flip all the vet bills…  Off to humane society we would go.... Someone out there will take care of it (spend $$$$$).  I could see how some cat lovers would take offense to using a sick cat as “Musky bait”.   I kind of take offence to that too; we don’t want any Muskie’s getting sick out there!"

My favorite !       Excerpts from a Cat's Diary:    Day 983 of my captivity. My captors continue to taunt me with bizarre little dangling objects.  They dine lavishly on fresh meat, while the other inmates and I are fed hash or some sort of dry nuggets. Although I make my contempt for the rations perfectly clear, I nevertheless must eat something in order to keep up my strength.  The only thing that keeps me going is my dream of escape. In an attempt to disgust them, I once again vomit on the carpet.  Today I decapitated a mouse and dropped its headless body at their feet.  I had hoped this would strike fear into their hearts, since it clearly demonstrates what I am capable of.  However, they merely made condescending comments about what a 'good little hunter' I am.  buggers.  There was some sort of assembly of their accomplices tonight.  I was placed in solitary confinement for the duration of the event.  However, I could hear the noises and smell the food.  I overheard that my confinement was due to the power of 'allergies.'  I must learn what this means and how to use it to my advantage..  Today I was almost successful in an attempt to assassinate one of my tormentors by weaving around his feet as he was walking...  I must try this again tomorrow -- but at the top of the stairs.  I am convinced that the other prisoners here are flunkies and snitches.  The dog receives special privileges. He is regularly released - and seems to be more than willing to return.  He is obviously retarded.   The bird has got to be an informant.  I observe him communicating with the guards regularly.  I am certain that he reports my every move.  My captors have arranged protective custody for him in an elevated cell, so he is safe. For now........."
379951,Tom McCutcheon,2009-09-04 21:17:00,627,I have visions of a cat sitting at a desk at 3:00 a.m. while his captors sleep writing that..
