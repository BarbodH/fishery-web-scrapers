379662,Rich,2009-09-04 00:14:00,3927,Whatcha got there is a bass with strong genetic ties to it's sunfish heritage
379758,hockeyplayerz_14,2009-09-04 05:01:00,160,wow thats pretty cool.
379772,Harrison,2009-09-04 12:14:00,2202," Funny, I was thinking the same thing JP."
379783,blaque,2009-09-04 12:50:00,2419,"WOW, when you said orange..........i didnt know you meant ORANGE!!!!!!!!! Dude, thats definitely interesting..............that ive NEVER seen"
379791,Governator,2009-09-04 13:02:00,879,That's freakin' cool!  Definitely looks like a bass/perch combo
379823,Uncle Buck,2009-09-04 14:14:00,1000,Looks like a perch was raped by a bass....  That's the offspring
379853,bubbles,2009-09-04 15:28:00,591,"That is one freaky looking Bass, thanks for sharing."
379857,BillM,2009-09-04 15:35:00,17367,Reminds me of the blue finned 'eyes we caught on our flyin trip this year.

379927,Roy,2009-09-04 19:24:00,13728," If they could, we'd only be able to catch them on surface corn."
376347,Devious,2009-08-25 17:02:00,49,I was out fishing with my buddy Jeff last night for largies and he caught one that had bright orange fins and tail?  This was on a back lake and ive never seen anything like it....every fin including the tail was bright bright orange exactly like a perch....we got some pics but I dont have them yet and will post them when Jeff sends them to me.   Anyone experienced this or have an explanation?  Did a perch bone a bass ? Haha
376354,Raf,2009-08-25 17:15:00,3495,was the water hot?  did it take a while to land?  perhaps a sign of a stressed fish.
376356,frozen-fire,2009-08-25 17:21:00,542,probably a rare genetic mutation. can't wait to see pics.
376358,TC1OZ,2009-08-25 17:25:00,987,Its cancer!  I would like to see the pics as well!
376365,bigfish1965,2009-08-25 17:31:00,3382,Maybe it was an Atlantic Salmon.... Sorry...someone had to say it..lol. Can't wait to see the pics. I have noticed musky from St Clair have very oddly coloured fins..maybe a local colour thing?
376399,Devious,2009-08-25 19:16:00,49, Didnt take long to land at all because it wasnt all that big....around a lb or a bit smaller I think...not sure how warm the water was but it was warm out yesterday....im gonna try and post the pics later but im not sure if Ill be able to get them for tonight.
376400,Devious,2009-08-25 19:17:00,49, Maybe?  Ive fished this lake all summer since I was kid since thats where our cottage is and ive never seen anything like it...or on any lake ive fished for that matter.
376401,solopaddler,2009-08-25 19:19:00,8605," Okay, now that you've elaborated...Sometimes juveniles will have an orange colouration in their fins. I've seen it more often in smallmouth but it's not unheard of with largemouth. Remember they are members of the sunfish family."
376408,blaque,2009-08-25 19:41:00,2419,Musta been a peacock bass  
376409,Cudz,2009-08-25 19:42:00,2652,I am going to go with Red Oscar. People have them as pets and when they get too big they toss them. A few have survived.  They can look a bit like a bass.  edit** Upon further review I want to take my guess back.  They are more orange bodied with black fins. now I just want to see the pic.
376412,blaque,2009-08-25 19:43:00,2419,"seriously though, ive seen them somewhat reddish orange  "
376415,Harrison,2009-08-25 19:52:00,2202,"Hey Blaque, is that a Great lakes fish?  Lake O?  I have seen that colouring before on some fish we get out in the deeper water."
376432,blaque,2009-08-25 20:39:00,2419,"  Sorry , i should have noted.........i swiped that from the net, but have seen this coloration before."
376440,Greencoachdog,2009-08-25 20:54:00,8163,Micropterus Coosae (Red Eye Bass) has orange fins and tail. They're native to the Coosa River that I fish and have been stocked elsewhere.  http://myfwc.com/WildlifeHabitats/Freshwat..._RedeyeBass.htm
376740,Ramble,2009-08-26 13:41:00,713,Sounds like a little phenotypic plasticity too me.
376780,bucktail,2009-08-26 16:18:00,1857,I have caught a few around Quinte that have had that colouring. A few over 30 years that is!
376785,Cookslav,2009-08-26 16:27:00,1457,"I have seen that before in Smaller Bass as well. I used to fish the conservation area in Durham when I was younger, and it was common in the smaller fish to have the orange fins. The larger fish did not have orange fins but they did have exceptionally red eyes on occasion.  I'm no expert but I'd guess its an enviromental coloration based on some sort of habbitat oddity.  Oh, and I'm talking smallmouth Bass, not largies"
376791,cranks bait,2009-08-26 16:51:00,721,It didn't look like this one did it? 
379580,Devious,2009-09-03 21:42:00,49,Sorry its taken me so long to get these posted guys.....the colours look pretty cool     
379581,bigfish1965,2009-09-03 21:44:00,3382,"Cool... Since they all seem to have it, it may be an environmental thing...perhaps a high iron content in the water."
379582,JohnF,2009-09-03 21:48:00,3494,Isn't it obvious? His momma was messin' with a big ole horny perch. Lady basses ain't really ladies.  JF
379595,mrdylan,2009-09-03 22:26:00,111,Never seen that before.
379598,Kenny G,2009-09-03 22:35:00,118,Cross breeding with a perch. Kenny G.
379599,JPD,2009-09-03 22:35:00,296,Looks like someone gave him highlights with the bait dye they sell at BPS!
379637,danbouck,2009-09-03 23:52:00,4380, lol it's that Cronzy guy
