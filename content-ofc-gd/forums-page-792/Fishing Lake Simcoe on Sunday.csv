I have all the equipment, just need to know if I should jut focus on Pike and Perch in Cook's Bay or head for deeper water and try for some Lakers.  I'll be taking my 6 year old son with me, so I don;t want to be trolling for hours and having him get bored.  Then again I wouldn;t mind trying for about an hour to break up the day - just wanted to know if it was worth the effort to bring the downrigging equipment.  Cheers."
