We really have more of a deer problem in the suburbs of Cheektowaga and Amherst which both border the city of Buffalo......instead of having the bow hunters take care of the problem for free they pay so called sharp shooter police officers OVERTIME to hunt them down at night.

There was a big bodied adolescent hanging around the Mij parking lot for a while....made the walk from the truck to the dock interesting.  There are alot of anecdotal population measurments going on with the MNR but no intense mark recapture work occuring that I know of (maybe algonquin still???)

But a Spring hunt would be a great tool that once worked to help control the bear populations. Its also a very easy and tangeble step to take, so it make sense to get the ball rolling.  As far as odditys with regards to sprawl related sightings go... Fergus, Elora, Kitchener, Angcaster, London...all areas not known to have bears yet now we do? I can't say with certainty that it is related to the cancelation as opposed to the sprawl...maybe a bit of both?  But our brothers to the north are getting inindated for no good reason other then a canceled hunt.... There is little to no urban sprawl in a little sleepy town like earlton Ontario yet they now see twice the bear encounters.  Could be the southern sprawl puching them north, but I'd bet the farm the bigger contributor is the lack of population control(ie. the hunt)"

Good response.   Yes there is alot of developing going on everywhere. Yes maybe the bears get pushed to different locations,have cubs,then more developing,move again,creating bigger numbers in smaller places for them. More sightings. Still like some have said,they will and do get nervy and sooner or later,there will be a mauling,then an out cry to kill the bears.    If I had a farm,I would bet it too."

BUT,I just watched a coverage that the MNR dosent seem to be on our side, as far as hunters go. Large population of bears this year and over 1000 calls to the bear watch,all they have to say is take your bird feeders down til winter and put your garbage out the morning of pick up.   The spring hunt was stopped years ago(due to heart bleeders from the big city,we all know this) Now with this being said,the ones that live with the bears,are being harassed by the bears. Pop has had one right up to the back door. He just fired a shot from the 12 guage and off he went. Has others now coming to the house.   So my question is,is it the bears before us,or the other way?  I know they were here before us,but to me IMO,it maybe time to bring back the spring hunt."

379269,Cookslav,2009-09-02 23:00:00,1457," Long time overdue. Never was a valid reason for the cancelation in the first place.... Tree huggers spouting off about orphaned cubs and high priced ""expert"" oppinions but no science, or studies to prove it....but hey it was a popular Big City topic so it made for some great political jargin.  Funny thing is research now suggests more Cubs are orphaned or destroyed yearly. Mother bears can be and are often labled a nuiscance bears, destroyed or relocated leaving Cubs to fend for themselves, or face being put down as a humane alternative...  I'm no expert but perhaps the MNR should get on board with the OFAH and put a bit more Science into the mix."
379270,Twocoda,2009-09-02 23:03:00,4130,i wonder how the heart bleeders from the city feel about bears eating bears because of the competition for food.....BRING BACK THE SPRING HUNT! or adjust the cull for the fall
379277,kickingfrog,2009-09-02 23:36:00,8333,Another factor to consider is our increasing population and steady encroachment on limited natural spaces. This is not a simple problem with a simple solution.
379278,tambo,2009-09-02 23:39:00,85,i saw the same thing on a channel  i guess they could increase the number of fall tags easier than reintroducing the spring hunt  i'm sure there are a lot of orphaned bears because of nuisance bears being shot legally ie culls and illegally

Bush mostly. Each year the numbers are going up. I understand this will happen over the years,but the bear problem is getting worse by the year.   The sollution like you say may not be simple,but letting the tree huggers say whats best? Well like mentioned,time for the MNR and OFAH to get together."

I did not intend for my comment to be construed as a tree hugger's perspective, or to suggest that what they say is best. My comment was more about our increasing footprint as a whole, not about individual encounters. There will always be unwelcome encounters with bears. What is an ""acceptable"" number??? I don't know.  Shooting this year's ""problem bears"" does not fix the problem because next year, another bear will take this year's bear's place if the larger issue is not addressed.  This is about wildlife populations that don't know municipal or properties boundaries from raspberries. As well as dumb  politicians that make many of their decisions based on votes and dollars, not science, because we continue to let them."

379412,JohnF,2009-09-03 13:21:00,3494," It's all part of the natural order, evolution if you will. Man's here, that's a fact. As man evolves and multiplies the previous occupants of the space will have to learn to adapt or disappear. There's probably no way for man and bears to comfortably cohabit a space. We're too dissimilar for that to happen. All the bears are doing is trying to adapt to the new system. That means foraging in the garbage cans that are readily available food sources rather than scrambling ever harder for rodents and berries that are being destroyed by us encroachers.  Man's history is filled with these stories. Also with stories of fiascoes perpetrated by politicians trying to garner votes from bleeding hearts wanting to compensate for or stop this evolutionary process. Unfortunately there's a price to be paid for modern man's  procreative and acquisitive nature and it's being paid by the critters and by some of the people involved.  Sadly, we can't have our cake and eat it too.  JF"
