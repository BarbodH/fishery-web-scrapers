So with them being on different circuits i decided to remove the cover at the top of the shaft ...heres what i found wrong   In behind the cover there is an spaded terminal connection , seems the connections had gotten hot on several occasions and melted the ends of the wires / termianls causing a poor contact between the two .           I removed the spaded connectors and stripped back the wires cleaned ad solder the tips of them then used heat shrinkable union connectors .     This time i tucked the wires back under the cover and kept them seperated ..Originally they come tight together and when they got hot they melted together...    Now I can it full speed through the Slop and won't have to worry about the wires getting hot..."

I would say that was definatly the problem. As for the fix, great job. My one thought though is that those spade lugs were there for a reason, to take the motor apart for another fix. A bit of a problem now. Or, can you still disconnect them? Not clear in the photos(to me)if they still come apart or not."
