379674,laszlo,2009-09-04 00:35:00,487,"Sorry guys no pics. The story...  Saw two guys fishing together. The one friend went to remove the hook from a fish his buddy landed. His friends line was tight while he was removing the hook and when it came out it snapped right at him (the one removing the hook) and got stuck right in his ear. I got out my snips, cut off the barbed end of the hook and it came right out. No blood, little pain."

379723,Dara,2009-09-04 02:14:00,3052,You shoulda put a string on it and yanked it out. You could say it is the recomended method
379725,Twocoda,2009-09-04 02:17:00,4130,im thinking there are easier safer ways to pierce an ear...maybe he should go get a gold fish hook and put it back through the hole ...
379727,CLofchik,2009-09-04 02:32:00,854,"Off bottom or hardware?  Lol the piers are a dangerous place, come close a few times.  My personal fav was in the spring many moons ago off Bronte, some guy brought his kid out who promptly became  bored in 30 minutes.  Walked where he shouldn't and got a Cleo right in his ear, and doesn't the little ankle biter start screaming and running down the pier.  Well buddy just lifts his rod and starts fighting him like a fish!  BzzzzzzzzzzzWHAAAAAAAAAAzzzzzzzzzzWHAAAAWHAAAAWHAAAAAAzzzzzzzzzzz.  Lol poor kid made it almost halfway down the pier before somebody grabbed him and snapped the line."
379729,Greencoachdog,2009-09-04 02:36:00,8163,  Sounds like an olympic sport in the making to me!!!
379741,fishinguypat,2009-09-04 03:07:00,547,that would hurt...what the hell was wrong with the guy pulling on the kid?did he have no action that night or did he want to mount him on the wall?
379744,Cudz,2009-09-04 03:36:00,2652,Wow I remember that story from back in 1989 or around that time.  Maybe it is just one of the urban legends.
379785,Fang,2009-09-04 12:51:00,1330,The mayhem has begun. lock up your children and keep well away from petro park till end of October
379817,bubbles,2009-09-04 14:03:00,591,So nobody is gonna fess up and tell us it was them who took it in the ear so we can poke fun at them for a few hours?????
379858,CLofchik,2009-09-04 15:36:00,854, Yeah it was around then.  Lol I've spent way too much of my life on that pier
