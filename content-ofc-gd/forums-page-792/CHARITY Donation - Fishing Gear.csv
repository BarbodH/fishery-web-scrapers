379401,diggyj,2009-09-03 12:22:00,548,"Was wondering if anyone knew of a Childrens Charity or other that would take used rods, reels and tackle? I would like to donate some stuff after cleaning out the boathouse. I have 5 complete rod/reel outfits, 5 reels and 2 full tackle boxes.  I would like it to be a charity that helps kids learn to and get involved with fishing.  Contact info appreciated.  Dirk"

380108,singingdog,2009-09-05 10:27:00,1047,I have donated a fair bit of stuff to the OPP. They have a great Cops & Kids fishing program and always need fishing stuff. Another option would be Cottage dreams. It is a charity that donates stays at cottages to folks recovering from cancer. A couple of rods and some plastic grubs always make a kids stay at the cottage more fun.
