379324,Mark Bleau,2009-09-03 02:11:00,12,Hey guys I was just wondering at what time of year can you fish for Salmon or Trout and not have to go to far out.I have a 16 foot Crestliner with downriggers but don't want to get to far out.I fish Erie without to much trouble as long as I watch the weather.Any help would be appreciated.Thanks...Any ramp location it doesn't really matter.
379331,danada,2009-09-03 02:40:00,31,"You can fish out of bronte, 50-100 ft of water and you'll do alright. you wont be too far out and just keep your eye on the weather."
379352,fishinguypat,2009-09-03 03:40:00,547,and  for parking at bronte $5.00 its pretty good
379361,CLofchik,2009-09-03 04:13:00,854,"Bronte's had a hard time with security the last couple of years, 16 Mile, Fisherman's Pier & Credit will put you on the same or better fishing.  I'd go with 16 Mile, small but decent ramp and I think it's still free (but not sure)."
379402,Carp,2009-09-03 12:23:00,1488,"The time is now !!!  Chinooks are getting closer to shore. Lots of bows and cohos further out.  If you fish L. Erie, you can certainly fish L. Ontario. I'm out 20km or more sometimes in a 16 foot boat with 25hp.  Good Luck !"
379409,Fang,2009-09-03 13:04:00,1330,16 mile is now a pay launch too. it's one of those meter things so be sure to bring your loonies and toonies. The sign says $5 for 3 hours but the machine will take additional $ and keep addiing on time to your ticket.  As said before yes time is now. best fishing of the year. low boat traffic now that derby is over. I like the 180-250 zone south east of oakville launches. you can bump into most stuff out there.  riggers and diver work well
379558,Mark Bleau,2009-09-03 20:38:00,12,Thanks guys is it usually just the regular size spoons or are the magnums the way to go also any favorite colours or brands...I take it a NW wind is preferred...
379565,moemoe,2009-09-03 20:48:00,352,"Near shore fish are still there, fish 50 -70 fow for an early bite, with baits near the bottom, We caught 8 this morning with the biggest 24 and change,  but no fish after 8:30, Spin doctor dipsy fly did much better than spoons....."
