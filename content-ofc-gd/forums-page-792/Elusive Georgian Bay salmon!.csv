Pounding a spot that used to produce easily 10-20 hits in a morning, even last year i'd get one or two in a morning. So got up at five am hoped my luck would change and off i went. Ended up with four fish on and got these two. Things are still looking pretty grim for the salmon run up here these two had the typical thin skinny bodies, should still taste good once they're through the smoker. Atleast there are still a few around. Anyhow heres a couple pics.  "

379946,12footspringbok,2009-09-04 21:09:00,459, Nottawasaga river.    Ya its not a walleye diver but a rapala taildancer. Those salmon get angry at that little baby rainbow colour...lol

380056,Guest gbfisher,2009-09-05 02:06:00,0,it's almost funny to see them at that size in the river.  Nice catch.
