380063,bigugli,2009-09-05 02:24:00,6138,Got out for 3 hours this evening to work over this one trough I found a little while back on L Gibson. I just dragged tubes across the bottom of the trench and the smallies were on heavy. They were ripping the tubes off the jigs or inhaling them on the way down. Only wish I had time to get out earlier. A few pics:     Even managed a few surprise slabs just as it got dark.

380104,bigfish1965,2009-09-05 07:34:00,3382,Let me know when you are heading there again Bruce. I think my back may be good enough to chase some smallies around and its only a few minutes from my place. I just might know a spot in that area with something a bit bigger to chase after
