372801,mbosh1980,2009-08-14 23:39:00,349,"hey, im looking for some input as to how to spend the $250 at bps I will get soon.  I guess i got one of the secondary prizes from the adopt an angler contest wfn had on (18th place wahoo!).  my thoughts are... 1st buy my wife a spinning combo so she has a setup of her own.  and for me either  a baitcast setup (7ft mh fast action), or  another bps extreme spinning combo(7ft mh same as baitcast) .  I already have one mounted on an old berkely medium light 7' spinning rod.  I figure if i get another one paired with a mh rod, that leaves me with two setups and 4 line choices if i spool different line on each spool.  The big decider is if i go for speed and power over versatility and the flexibility of having multiple line choices. I usually fish clear/stoney lake in the kawarthas as well as lake ontario from shore. any thoughts/ suggestions?"

372806,Syn,2009-08-14 23:55:00,519,"$100-$150 for the wifes gear. rod/reel/fishing line, then a mh for you.  I got a mh and a m rod. It is so nice to switch back and forth once the active fish are caught with the mh (pike, bass), switch to more subtle presentation with m rod.  I use the m for smaller stuff like plastic worms, small crankbaits, bobber fishing, mh for spinnerbaits, larger lures. spooled 60lb braid, 15 lb mono on mh rod spooled 12lb flouro, 6lb flouro for bobber fishing for small fish on m rod.  This year I got a fish finder and it turned into a must have item for reading the bottom. That could also be a good purchase."

372819,JohnF,2009-08-15 00:41:00,3494,"If you've alreay got a good assortment of gear, then blow it on something great, or at least good. Think like a guy standing on the deck of a bassboat. There should be a solid variety of rigs already lured and ready to toss to the followers. Odds are yer wife will be perfectly happy with a wacky worm on a spinning rod whilst you toss the buzzfrog on a really nice baitcaster. Everybody wins!  JF"
372821,mbosh1980,2009-08-15 00:46:00,349,"thanks guys, for sure she is getting something...she got me most of my votes. i think im leaning towards another spinning combo for me...pretty happy with the reel i got already."
372824,Muskieman,2009-08-15 00:55:00,2472,Congrats on the WIN.  Do they sell BEER a BPS ? ....Largemouth Ale ?      Muskie Amber?  Walleye Pale Ale?  Perch Pilsner?  Didn't think so........  Get something nice for Momma......something that YOU can use when she's not around.  CHEERS!!!   Enjoy BPS....  RFS 
372826,JohnF,2009-08-15 01:01:00,3494," No way! She did it for him, so he should honour her intent and get something that will make him come home saying ""Thank you, dear."" over and over again. She'll treasure that becuz that was what she was shooting for in the first place.  JF"
372868,Roy,2009-08-15 12:51:00,13728," I can hear the swoons from the wimmins of the community from here, John."
372882,JohnF,2009-08-15 14:53:00,3494, Mine spoils me. What can I tell ya?  JF
372883,Roy,2009-08-15 14:56:00,13728,If she spoils ya....you're probably worth it.  (that's a good thing)
379926,mbosh1980,2009-09-04 19:23:00,349,"well i went this weekend and got a baitcaster combo for about a hundred, picked up some other tackle and got my better half her own rod/reel and tackle box.  Still got a bit left for the next time i go back. I took a look at the results of that contest.  There where like 4-5 people with zero votes as secondary winners?!  I guess it had to do with their cable provider. http://www.wfn.tv/adopt/ Anyway I'm loving the baitcaster.  Only a couple small birdsnests so far.  i was expecting a lot more during the learning phase."
