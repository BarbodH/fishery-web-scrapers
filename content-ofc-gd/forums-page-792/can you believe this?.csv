380107,pikehunter,2009-09-05 10:26:00,1659," Yep! Rotten Yankees, oughta stop every one of them from crossing the border! You would never, ever catch a Northerner, a European, an Asian or any other foreigner doing that.  Too bad that they didn't lock them up and throw the key away!"
380111,Roy,2009-09-05 11:24:00,13728,Be careful folks. 'Tongue in cheek' and 'just kidding' comments don't come out the way they're intended over the net. It just fosters ill will.
380211,Whitespinnerbait,2009-09-05 21:51:00,2038,  Sounds to me like youv'e been spying on people ..........Watching guys eating as much fish as they can then throwing a little extra to the bears..  How do you know they were Americans...........
380214,Greencoachdog,2009-09-05 21:58:00,8163,  Because a Canadain would NEVER do that!
380221,redneck666,2009-09-05 22:33:00,563,  LOL! got that right!
380224,Spiel,2009-09-05 22:43:00,9065,"I've been on this ride before, makes me dizzy!"
379669,Whitespinnerbait,2009-09-04 00:20:00,2038,   The Americans are not the only ones......Theres also Chinese and Viatnamese dudes .......And then theres the Quebecers.......
379670,Greencoachdog,2009-09-04 00:21:00,8163, I hear they're the worst!!!
379695,holdfast,2009-09-04 01:02:00,1813," You betcha, When I lived in Quebec, I always gave you Americans the wrong Directions to fishing lakes.  Also the Skin Bars in Mtl.  I always wondered what they thought when they entered the LimeLight by mistake.  For got to tell them it was a Boy Bar."
379715,danc,2009-09-04 01:43:00,4677," This is nothing new. Happens all the time at our Northwestern Ontario border crossings. Canadians get charged just as much proportionately IMHO. Bottom line is that we don't allow anyone to rape our resources. What saddens me is the fact the the guys from Oklahoma City, the tornado capital of the USA, came to to fish here and died in a tornado."
379747,angrypigeon,2009-09-04 03:49:00,31,i love poaching - it's the best way to cook eggs
379752,angrypigeon,2009-09-04 04:08:00,31," ""Ji Hua Wu, of Mississauga, and Gong Quan Liu, of Toronto, pleaded guilty to two counts of catching and keeping fish during the closed season. In addition to the fines and licence suspensions, the men had their rods, tackle and fishing gear seized permanently.""  i wonder if chinese ppl are caught poaching more than other races.  i think this is a cultural thing, but most chinese fishermen don't release their fish.  we need better education for c&r in this community."
379753,Jonny,2009-09-04 04:12:00,1380," A while back you joked about wanting to 'rape the resource'. Two of the stories at wawa-news.com show that a few American anglers are doing just  that!  There are bad apples in every barrel, whether stamped with a maple leaf or ""Product of USA"".  American anglers who blatantly break Canadian catch and possession regulations, or Canadians who do it in the USA, should have their fishing privileges in the host country revoked for life (in addition to hefty fines and confiscations)."
379759,holdfast,2009-09-04 05:23:00,1813," Yea, to think I was Banded from going into the USA for two years because I got caught by two American MPs in Fort Bragg just for Peeing outside their Mess at closing time. Glad I wasnt Poaching  The only problem is, When I heard someone yell at me, And I told them to take a hike, I met two of the Biggest Gorillas with my pecker still in my hand.  Ouch and jail; time till my officer bailed me."
379762,Greencoachdog,2009-09-04 10:42:00,8163,"Those Michigan dudes are a blackeye to the U.S. and an embarrassment to me!!! I despise poachers, they're nothing more than thieves!!!  I can count the number of fish I've harvest while fishing in Canada on one hand (4), I'm mainly a C&R fisherman... and I never take any back accross the border, it's just too big of a hassle.  I buy the annual non resident Sportsman license whenever I go up to Canada to fish, even though I just use it for a few days. I consider it my donation to the MNR.  I don't think poaching penalties are nearly as harsh as they should be, I'd like to see some jail time to go along with those fines for those thieves!"
379812,addy79,2009-09-04 13:59:00,573, thats a strong statement...
379827,huey graphite,2009-09-04 14:31:00,362,  Strong....but probably accurate. I see nothing offensive in his post. As a matter of fact it strikes me as positive as he suggests educating those who are unaware of our limits perhaps due to a language/cultural barrier.
379835,Dara,2009-09-04 14:52:00,3052,"  that sounds like a copout  you move to a new country, you learn the laws Why should we have to pay to hold everybodys hand"
379837,oates,2009-09-04 14:53:00,151,see and some people don't like the MNR - good thing it exists!
379842,addy79,2009-09-04 15:02:00,573, yes and no. suggesting to educate the masses (not simply certain anglers based on their culture/language) is great. Making assumptions of catch and release habbits based on a groups race... not great.  im done with this one. dont want to open that can a worms!  
379847,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-09-04 15:08:00,0,"perhaps someone could also educate the french, italian, native, finnish, czech, and all other races while they're at it... all races are absolutely LOADED with ignorant people."
379848,huey graphite,2009-09-04 15:11:00,362," Not a copout......anyone poaching needs to be held accountable. Ignorance of the law is no excuse. Pehaps a fine is the best way to educate.    In his post he says ""most"" and therefore is not painting them all with the same brush. I took his post as personal observation and not based on proven fact."
379850,DRIFTER_016,2009-09-04 15:17:00,10439,  Translation: The local MP is having a family fish fry this weekend!!!!
379851,DRIFTER_016,2009-09-04 15:20:00,10439,  A nice poached salmon is good too!!!
379890,Jonny,2009-09-04 18:02:00,1380,"C&R is a good thing, but the place to start might be to educate re:, and enforce, limits, seasons, sanctuaries, etc.  The mentality (in any quarter or in any group) that the regulations are things to be ignored in the quest for eating fish has to be discouraged and penalized.  Once that attitude has been established, and the deterrent is in place for those who are resistant, then C&R might have a better chance of being accepted."
379897,Dara,2009-09-04 18:31:00,3052," You wanted to educate people based on race. We have law schools for that. You have to pay to go to them I had to learn the fishing regs myself. I see no need in holding special classes, other than behind bars.  Or maybe we should have mandatory fishing classes before you can buy a license, kinda like the boaters exam"
380050,moparhawk,2009-09-05 01:51:00,146,"Hell we ain't all bad. I've fished legally in Ontario for many years and gotta say theres many times I catch myself wishing I lived in Perrault Falls. I do agree with strict consequences, maybe even turn em loose nutless. Try to remember in the event of a major catrostraphe or lets say Canada's been placed under attack you know who will be first to offer aid."
380069,Puckhead,2009-09-05 02:42:00,377,"^I know y'all don't consider Alabama part of your union, but I'd say it was an american who made that statement...lol..."
380072,bow slayer,2009-09-05 02:47:00,1074,"I agree with Dara I am sick of people using the cultrual barrier thing as an excuse. Plain and simple if you want to fish ,learn the regs. I know plenty of new canadians I have worked with that love to fish and hunt. They all learned the regs and follow them and if they didn't they know the price."
380087,pike slayer,2009-09-05 04:03:00,1177,"ya tons of americans up here raping the land, theres no way they would ever get by the border with those fish. what i see alot of americans doing now is catch and eat as much as they can and if they cant eat it throw the fish away in the bush for the bears. i seen that bull last weekend with about 10 americans camping at a very good lake. what i'd like to know is how do these guys find our good lakes???? who the hell is telling them? send them off to some mud puddle"
380094,Jonny,2009-09-05 04:34:00,1380,"If you see ""a lot"" of this, you can always get a registration no. off the boat and call the MNR."
379448,redneck666,2009-09-03 14:42:00,563,"Okay, here it is.... americans (from michigan) were checked at an mnr check station in northern ontario (agawa bay) and had an illegal possesion limit of 72 or 76 walleye! that of which was over the groups limit by 36 fish.... not only that, they had them illegaly packaged in a way that they were not readily available to be counted or indentified. people like that is the reason why the fisheries are going to hell. i would love to pass my love of fishing onto my kids some day but what would they think if their sitting there not catching fish?  oh ya and they got fined $7,200!"
379450,Dara,2009-09-03 14:45:00,3052,When was that one? I hope it costs them a bunch of money
379452,anders,2009-09-03 14:48:00,1168,its on wawa-news.com today...  I read that as well and was shocked....there were a few good ones on the site today
379454,addy79,2009-09-03 14:52:00,573,"i woul ban them from fishing up here for LIFE, Charge em, fine em.  end of story"
379456,Dara,2009-09-03 14:53:00,3052,  shocked?..doesn't suprise me    but look at the tourist dollars we would miss
379458,redneck666,2009-09-03 14:55:00,563,"  yes, thats true! but if no body's gunna follow the law then why bother letting them in eh? specially if their gunna diminish the fisheries like that!"
379459,NAW,2009-09-03 14:57:00,4022, And the $7 200 donated to the MNR!!

379461,redneck666,2009-09-03 15:01:00,563,"haha got that right GCD! lol do you southerners count yourselves as americans, or...........?"
379464,Roy,2009-09-03 15:06:00,13728,"Let's see, that's 36 fish for $7200. If each fish was 7.14lbs, that's twice the going rate for walleye at Loblaws."
379465,addy79,2009-09-03 15:07:00,573,"keep the tourist dollars, there damaging MY resources  that wawa news site is interesting...  check out this story, busted with garbage bags of walters and muskies in APRIL!  http://www.wawa-news.com/index.php?option=...&Itemid=134  BRUTAL  shoulda banned em for 10 years"
379466,jediangler,2009-09-03 15:09:00,1923,They got off way to easy.
379480,brifishrgy,2009-09-03 16:00:00,559,those are the ones that got caught .. how may slip thru without getting checked .. my guess .. lots  as far as there being no fish left up north .. its gonna take a whole lot more then a few bad apples to fish out those lakes .. besides the MNR now has the extra funding for patrols (if they even see any of the fine money)
379482,POLLIWOGG,2009-09-03 16:03:00,835,"Probably never see them again ,or the 7 grand unless there were some vehicles seized."
379492,MCTFisher9120,2009-09-03 16:31:00,3761,"Nobody needs that many fish. Bring back a few maybe a fish or 2 per person and have a nice meal.  Nothing that excessive should be allowed...question is, did they throw the fish in the garbage(waste) or did they give it back to the criminals..."
379493,LucG,2009-09-03 16:35:00,779,"Unbelievable...     36 fish over the limit  ...i don't even know what to say.   There's no way they gave them the fish.  It was prob either disposed of, or given to the local community etc"
379495,Joey,2009-09-03 16:43:00,9122, Well there won't be much tourism dollars when all the fish are gone and they don't come here anymore will there
379496,bubbles,2009-09-03 16:49:00,591," That is the problem, people think this way and it's far from the truth.  If people continue to do it our kids will tell you all about it when you are in the old age home.  A couple for dinner and leave the rest for me!"
379499,anders,2009-09-03 16:53:00,1168,"the confisicated fish and game for that matter in Wawa are given to seniors that cant get out much, or the native elders or the legion that will have fish fries."
379500,bubbles,2009-09-03 16:53:00,591,   All the fish were seized and forfeited to the Crown
379518,redneck666,2009-09-03 18:13:00,563,"  believe me, the local fishing in some of the lakes you can drive into is horrible enough already!"
379646,holdfast,2009-09-04 00:02:00,1813,"What is the Limit per person, also say it is 3 fish per pers does that mean that one person can keep 21 Fish for one week when they leave home.  I mean can you accumulate?  By the way, when they opened up the Petawawa Training area for fishing after being closed forever, I  heard of a pers (Probably a Soldier or Civilian Employee, caught by Range Control with 56 Bass in their Trunk.  What Part of Canada they were from I will not say.  But they were definitely not from the Province of Ontario. And they were charged in Civilian Court as well as Military.  Probably a Military catch all  Section 129  ( In that he acted unprofessionally in that he knowingly broke the law by Illegally harvesting Fish on DND Property) or something to that effect."
379648,Greencoachdog,2009-09-04 00:03:00,8163,So only Americans poach in Canada?
379663,holdfast,2009-09-04 00:15:00,1813,"Oh, Yea Coach!  Well I heard, Its only Crazy Canucks that actually shoot Americans in Vermont during the Hunting season.  So There."
379667,redneck666,2009-09-04 00:18:00,563,"GCD, your on a roll! lol.......  no, not only americans poach in canada, some greedy selfish canadians like to keep loads of fish too and you'd be surprised at how many people of both countries slip through the cracks of the MNR. and ALOT of americans seem to own property up here in the soo.   I'm pretty darn sure that for a set posesion limit in ontario waters means that at any time your only aloud that many fish per person."
