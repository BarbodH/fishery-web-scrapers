379647,bigfish1965,2009-09-04 00:02:00,3382,"Part of the terms when you signed up stated that account deletion was not an option. A deleted account does not do anything to your previous posts, so account deletion is essentially doing nothing. They stay there. Your best option if you don't want to participate is to just not post."
