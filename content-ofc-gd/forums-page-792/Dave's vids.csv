379883,Dave Mercer,2009-09-04 17:10:00,148,Sorry guys I have been on the west coast and the east coast all in one week it's been crazy! A new vid will be up today. It great to hear you like them we will keep on top of them more. The best way to keep these coming is for everyone to check them out. The more views we get from here the more budget we will be allowed to put towards them so we can do more! So everyone please make sure to check them out and tell your friends to as well. Hope everyone has a great long weekend!  Dave Mercer
