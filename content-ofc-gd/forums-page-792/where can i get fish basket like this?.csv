380120,MCTFisher9120,2009-09-05 11:59:00,3761,Bass Pro has them...  http://www.basspro.com/webapp/wcs/stores/s...__SearchResults  Enjoy and welcome to OFC...great first post!!
380137,Handlebarz,2009-09-05 13:38:00,3790,some times its nice to have a huge one so that they can swim around and enjoy there last hours of life. One thing to remember with them if your fishing in a boat is to bring it in before getting up  on plane you might get lucky and have it still there or have one with the plastic lid that helps it float.  CTC has smaller one's and so should almost any fishing store.
380142,Beans,2009-09-05 13:50:00,3339, Yep...just tossed one at the dump that the prop caught and tore a big hole in...LOL  Gotta remember to use a shorter rope on the new one...
