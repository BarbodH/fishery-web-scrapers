Unfortunately, he had to tell them that he couldn't go this time because his wife wouldn't let him. After a lot of teasing and name calling, Brad headed home frustrated.  The following week when Brad's buddies arrived at the lake to set up camp, they were shocked to see Brad. He was already sitting at the campground with a cold beer, swag rolled out, fishing rod in hand, and a camp fire glowing.  ""How did you talk your missus into letting you go Brad?""  ""I didn't have to,"" Brad replied. Yesterday, when I left work , I went home and slumped down in my chair with a beer to drown my sorrows because I couldn't go fishing. Then the ol' lady Snuck up behind me and covered my eyes and said, 'Surprise'.""  ""When I peeled her hands back, she was standing there in a beautiful see through negligee and she said, ' Carry me into the bedroom, tie me to the bed and you can do whatever you want'.....  So, Here I am!"""

379539,NAW,2009-09-03 19:36:00,4022,  Not sure if you're serious or not.  If you are....  NF means Not Fishing.  (as in the post is not related to fishing).  Others feel free to correct me if i'm wrong..  That just what I always thought it meant.
