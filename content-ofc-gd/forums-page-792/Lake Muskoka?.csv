They have an island northwest of Beaumaris. Thinking that some smallmouth will hit topwaters in the evening or morning is there anything else? Wont try for lakers but any suggestion on pike or walleye or bass will be appreciated. Thanks in advance."
379810,Harrison,2009-09-04 13:54:00,2202,"Ehg, topwaters will get fish all day.  Try a variety of baits off the breaks in 6 - 10ft.  Inline spinners, senkos, jerkbaits, tubes etc... for SMB.  Pike, find weed, throw jerkbait / spinnerbait."
379877,ehg,2009-09-04 16:31:00,2666,"  Thanks Harrison, the 6-10 ft. breaks is the info i was looking for. Was thinking of jerkbaits and spinnerbaits maybe will throw inline spinners as well. The topwaters all day at this time of year is a given. Thanks!"

379899,Harrison,2009-09-04 18:32:00,2202, No prob.  GPS Cords for the Pigeon Lake giant SMB spot would be a suffice thank you.
379935,ehg,2009-09-04 20:38:00,2666, I do have an assortment of Jitterbugs will give this technique a try. Thanks!
