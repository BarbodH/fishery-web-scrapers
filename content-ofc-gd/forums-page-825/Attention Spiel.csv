Would be nice to have some calm water for once. I spend more time trying to get the anchor to hold then actually fish.  But at least the last time around I was allowed to bring up a couple of Herring and one Whitey.  The waves beat me into submission eventually but I had my prize. Thanks for the tips Chris. "

357394,Skud,2009-07-01 03:12:00,739,I put 9 feet of 3/8 chain on my anchor just before I went out and caught those fish. It did help because I would of had no chance of holding without it. Great workout bring it up with 120 feet of rope. I still am going to upgrade my anchor too though.

357546,Bly,2009-07-01 20:01:00,1556,"Well done.   One of these days I am going to have to fish for whiteys, if for no other reason than to confirm they smell like cucumbers  hehe"
