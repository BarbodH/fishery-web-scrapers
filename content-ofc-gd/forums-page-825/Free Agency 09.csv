356889,Angler16,2009-06-29 20:48:00,188,Your ideas ? How active will the leafs be who do you think they will sign?
356890,misfish,2009-06-29 20:52:00,29133,3-4
356894,jediangler,2009-06-29 21:02:00,1923,"Burke will sign his buddy Bertuzzi. Big, tough and past his prime. Just how Burke likes them."
356895,Fang,2009-06-29 21:03:00,1330,Not too many 09 FA that you you could count on to be key peices of a rebuild 3-4 years down the road. I'm sure Burke will pick up some bodies to plug holes. He's stated he will spend up to the cap but they gotta be bad for a couple more years to get more high first round picks.  I'd like to see him go after Brad Winchester Ales Kotalik Johnny Oduya  be neat to see Chelios and Chris Neil in a leafs uniform for a year
356896,Angler16,2009-06-29 21:05:00,188,Is nash not a FA?
356945,jediangler,2009-06-29 22:34:00,1923,"There is good old Nik Antropov, who's available, and he only wants $5 million."
356953,Angler16,2009-06-29 23:11:00,188,he wouldnt make a difference in my opinion
357042,kennyman,2009-06-30 04:08:00,737,"Good call Fang. Love Johnny Oduya. That would be a great pickup. He's going to be a really good player a couple years down the road. Perfect timing. Chelios on the other hand, don't think so. Yikes. He's old enough to be most of their fathers. Liked him best as a hawk. Hall of famer, but he'l be out to pasture before the Leafs will need him."
357170,Angler16,2009-06-30 16:25:00,188,Agreed! hhaha
357194,jediangler,2009-06-30 17:37:00,1923,I heard Belfour is working out and going to attempt a comeback. He'd sure look good back in a Leaf uniform   .
357203,diggyj,2009-06-30 18:15:00,548,"Oduya has already resigned with the Devils, so he is out.  I don't see the Leafs doing much aside from possibly trading Kaberle for some draft choices or positional players.  They won't do much until 2010 when they have a tonne of room under the cap to spend money. Payroll last year was 52 million, it will be 42 million this year and will go down to 15 million next year. I think Burke will wait one more year then drive the BRINKS truck to any talented, avalaible players that he wants to sign.  That means one more year of missing the playoffs. But watch out in 2010.  Dirk....."
357256,charlied,2009-06-30 20:57:00,584,"I could possibly see him taking a look at Komisarek if Montreal doesn't re-sign him.  He fits Burke's player profile to a tee.  Big, rough and tough!"
357298,jediangler,2009-06-30 22:30:00,1923,"I would enjoy seeing this again next season, in a Leaf jersey or a Habs jersey.  "
357299,jediangler,2009-06-30 22:30:00,1923,Or more of this kind of action.  
357533,jediangler,2009-07-01 19:20:00,1923,Leafs just signed Colton Orr to a 4yr-$4million contract. Not bad for a guy who has 11 points in the NHL since 2001. Start planning the parade route.
357544,bucktail,2009-07-01 19:57:00,1857,"Burke wants the Leafs to get ""bigger and tougher"" thats an exact quote. Glad to see he still thinks it is 1991. Seriously does he have a clue. Speed and skill are what you look for in the NHL , look who was in the finals. He WILL probably sign Bertuzzi like Jedi Angler says.  What a joke!"
357586,Angler16,2009-07-01 22:12:00,188,LEAFS PICK UP: ORR KOMISERAK STUART EXELBY   SORRY FOR MISTAKES  MORE TO COME!  Geeze burke really did add some toughness..
357589,charlied,2009-07-01 22:20:00,584,"just wanted to state that I called this to a Tee!  Big tough guy, with Colton Orr and Garnet Exelby, Leafs just got a tad tougher!"
357590,charlied,2009-07-01 22:21:00,584,Oh yes he did....needs a few guys to protect the small guys like Blake and Grabovski!!
357650,Angler16,2009-07-02 01:06:00,188,YOU CALLED IT BRO
