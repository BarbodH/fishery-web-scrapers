356570,Leecher,2009-06-29 01:11:00,7832,It looks like it's upper lip got ripped out and then healed that way       I agree.... strange looking bass Leechman
356572,bassman,2009-06-29 01:25:00,384,Looks like he did the 100 yard dash in a 90 yard gym.

356591,danbouck,2009-06-29 01:50:00,4380,Must have taken a while to take the picture. Then it dried up and stayed like that
356593,BillM,2009-06-29 01:54:00,17367,That fish must have come from the Elk.

356883,NAW,2009-06-29 20:34:00,4022,The fish looks scared to death.  Must have been one ugly fisherman who caught it.
