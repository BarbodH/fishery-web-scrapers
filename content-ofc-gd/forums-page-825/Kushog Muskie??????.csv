357459,landry,2009-07-01 14:30:00,1005,I am going to Kushog Lake for a week this summer. My question is: are there muskie in this lake and if so how many. Thanks everyone. You can email me if you like. Much appreciated! Landry
357463,Rich,2009-07-01 14:42:00,3927,"Pike were introduced about 10 years ago, but as far as I know and have known there have never been musky there.  Good laker, smallmouth, largemouth and now pike fishing though."
357466,MuskyBill,2009-07-01 14:51:00,311,"I counted once, I found only 5. That was a while ago, they MAY have spawned since then, so the number might be higher."
357475,Bly,2009-07-01 15:09:00,1556,"Quick google seems to confirm the information that Rich has offered.   There might another member that has more info but if not maybe try calling the Kushog Lake Marine Phone #: 705-489-2628, or a local tackle shop.   Have a great trip!"
357484,crankbait,2009-07-01 15:50:00,82,There is about 11 musky give or take.

357504,landry,2009-07-01 17:50:00,1005,Thanks for the serious and humorous responses:) I will cast some muskie baits but it looks like a smallmouth mission. How is the fishing in Kushog in general?
