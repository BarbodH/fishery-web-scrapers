I’m trying to decide on where to go. I’ll have about 5 hours. I’m considering launching at Port Dalhousie but have only ever fished there from shore in the fall on a couple of occasions. Alternatively, I could go to Hamilton Harbour. Never fished there either but am curious to try.   I have a 14ft Lund with 20hp Yamaha, fishfinder, trolling motor,  in-line planar (downrigger is currently out of service). Any opinions/info. regarding opportunities at either location would be appreciated. It’s not often I get out so just want to make sure I make the most of it. Fifty Point would be the closest spot for me but as far as I know, this time of year there is not much in the area."
