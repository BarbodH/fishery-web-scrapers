Pulled up to one of my bass spots and started casting a spinner bait to some grassy edges. About 10 casts in I had a huge hit.    She instantly went airborn and made a couple of good runs, peeling off drag.  Had her hooked on the outside of the cheek.  Bass fishing was a little slow. Managed to get 18 largies and a few rock bass into the boat. Here is the best bass:    Fished till 1pm and called her a day."
