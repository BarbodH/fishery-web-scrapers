The plan is to look for bass and pike. On paper this area looks kind of straight with not much in the way of bays, points or other distinguishing structure. Is this area productive? Weather looks...promising. Maybe some suggestions for the smaller lakes in the area if the Moon isn't really a good bet? Thanks for the input and good luck to anyone heading out tomorrow!"
