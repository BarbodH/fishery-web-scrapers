We fished it today and did allright considering I've never fished sturgeon lake before.   15lbs and change took the crown, and we ended up with about 12.5lbs.  Would have been nice to land that 4+lber that broke my brother off, but we all have those stories don't we?  There was 76 boats and I think we finished around 25th with our weight.  Caught most of our fish in the flatgrass with texas rigged worms, tubes and dingers."
