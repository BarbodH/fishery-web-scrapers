355901,Fish4Eyes,2009-06-26 12:39:00,1022,"Mine means the obsession of strictly fishing for the eyes. If somebody does convince me to fish anything else, I don't give it a full effort like I do for the eyes for some strange reason. I should change my name to ""Eye_Pride"""
355926,bigugli,2009-06-26 13:56:00,6138,"2 roots to the 'Big Ugli'. As a teen, I had a bit of an explosive or ""ugli"" temper   and was known by some as the ugli Finn. It stuck. Now pan forward some 20 years to father and son. Rob was heavily into fishing. Wanted to fish tournies, and we started to make tackle. He wanted a name that would stick out, for the fishing team we were gonna be, and for the tackle we were making. I guess because he had more of my temper and other bad attributes   than I realized I threw up the Ugliboys, being like father like son. Although everybody calls me Bruce, the son and I are both Robert B. So Big Ugli was a way of differentiating tween the 2 of us, and it's been a good description, of sorts  , ever since."

355934,huey graphite,2009-06-26 14:14:00,362,"When I was a kid growing up in Niagara I used to pester my parents to let me go fishing with my older brother down in the whirlpool in the lower Niagara. Finally at around the age of 14 they agreed. It was quite a thrill for me. When we reached the bottom of the long trail, I noticed several guys fishing in waders with fishing vests, noodle rods, hats etc. We had a spinning setup with a Canadian Tire bag with a few spoons.  My brother said ""we call those guys huey graphites"". I guess it's kind of like the guy that goes golfing for the 1st time with hundreds of dollars spent on NIKE clothing and gear........doesn't necessarily mean they'll score better.  When I regstered, it was the 1st thing to come to mind."

355950,Greencoachdog,2009-06-26 15:00:00,8163,"GCD = Greencoachdog!    This a Greencoachdog color pattern on one of my favorite lures to throw!  I usually start out throwing a Whitecoachdog because that color pattern has caught me the most fish, if the fish aren't biting the WCD I'll try several of my other faves... if they aren't biting those I'll tie on a GCD!  They don't bite the GCD all the time... but sometimes it's the only color they'll bite!"
