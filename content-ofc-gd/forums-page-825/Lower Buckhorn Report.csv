357278,muskylund1,2009-06-30 21:43:00,18,"I spent last week at Beachwood Resort on Lower Buckhorn Lake in the Kawarthas. The fishing was good, but not great. Weather was warm and the water temps increased about 10 degrees Fahrenheit while we were there. With winds out of the North and East all week we struggled a bit to find consistent patterns, but we still caught fish every day. Three of us, including my 83 year old Dad, boated 12 muskies for the week (all released). The biggest muskies were a 45"" and a 44"". Bass fishing was decent, but not great (all released). The biggest Smallmouth was a 19.5"" that I caught on a Zara spook.  The 45"" musky hit a Lindy Tiger Tube that I cast back to fish that followed up my brother's Dunwright glider. My brother' 44"" musky hit a homemade bucktail that I had made for him a couple of years agos. We caught fish on topwater, bucktails, jerkbaits, crankbaits and swimbaits. All fish were caught casting. Here are some of the pics.  Tom    "
