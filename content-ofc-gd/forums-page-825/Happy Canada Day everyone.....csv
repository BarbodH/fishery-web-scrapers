357424,Roy,2009-07-01 11:29:00,13728,Have a great Canada Day everyone! I'll be off in a bit to help my youngest get settled in her new place then be back early enough to watch the fireworks here.
357444,tjsa,2009-07-01 13:16:00,1578," Do you mean the fireworks here on OFC, or in La Belle Provence?   :lol:  Have a great Canada Day everyone."
357446,Jonny,2009-07-01 13:25:00,1380,"Remember when it used to be called ""Dominion Day""? That had such a distinctive ring to it.  Happy Canada Day to all!  It might be sacreligious to some, but I find it's a pity the day can't ""float"" to be attached to the nearest weekend. In Canada, a summer holiday weekend is a treasure for many working people. I don't think it would subtract from the significance of the day."
