I've been their once before, and still regret not going out on a chartered fishing trip while I was there.  I am in need of a little info, and was wondering if anyone here could help me out.  1.  What species of fish can be caught out there?  My cousins go mackerel fishing there.  But it seems they're no more then glorified perch.  I want a big, long fight.  Any suggestions?  2.  Can anyone recommend a good guide that I can contact in PEI or Halifax to take me out on the water?  Any help would be great.  I realize that I could just research this stuff on-line, but nothing beats personal experience.  Thanks,"
