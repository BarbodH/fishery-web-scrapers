Total Hours Fishing - 2  Total Fish Landed - 4  Largest Fish - 16""      My brother in-law Andrew sporting the new waders I got him as a gift for graduating from U ot T. It's too bad he only caught 1 rock bass but he did hook into a huge smallie that took him into the branches of an overhanging tree. That was the end of that.     Hopefully another report to come by the end of next week."
