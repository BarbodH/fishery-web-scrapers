357088,HTHM,2009-06-30 13:07:00,4082,WHere are some inexpensive or even free! boat launches in the inner bay area?
357095,dave524,2009-06-30 13:23:00,4508,"It's been a lot of years but I used to launch off the end of Howey Ave, there was a small parking lot on MNR property there and a launch area suitable for smaller boats, it was mainly a launch for when the Waterfowl Management Unit is open to hunting . It is free if it is still open to the public."
357152,Rich,2009-06-30 15:32:00,3927,"There are no free ramps left on LPB. Pick a marina... if you're lucky some of the smaller ones still ""only"" charge $10"
357346,danbouck,2009-07-01 01:10:00,4380,Old Cut is only $10
357429,HTHM,2009-07-01 12:04:00,4082,Thanks for the tips guys! Where do I launch to be near Bait island?
357434,Radnine,2009-07-01 12:18:00,1538,"Not sure about bait Island Homeslice, but the launch at Port Rowan was only $10.00 last year when the guy at Turkey point wanted $20. Jim"
357464,Rich,2009-07-01 14:44:00,3927,Closest to Bait Island is Old Cut inside the inner bay. From outer bay there is Turkey Point marina. I'd suggest going the Old Cut route.
357488,danbouck,2009-07-01 16:07:00,4380,Fin and Feather may be the closest in St Williams
357515,IndySKS,2009-07-01 18:29:00,134,I think the Provincial Park is only $10. That's where i launch from.
