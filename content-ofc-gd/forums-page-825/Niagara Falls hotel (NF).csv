Just wondering if anyone down that way could recommend one or two, preferably with view of the falls... thanks in advance Rich"

We live 15 minutes away but had never stayed at a hotel in the falls, so this was kind of new to us.  Check out the site for some great deals!"

357430,Gerry,2009-07-01 12:07:00,257,The Glengate Hotel is a good value if you're not interested in a view of the falls. The rooms are quite nice and the price is reasonable.
