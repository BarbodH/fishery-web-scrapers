356996,Mike D from Lunkerville,2009-06-30 01:02:00,14,"  thanks MrEh... my philosophy for the show is a simple one: anyone who is passionate about fishing can make an interesting epsiode... ANYBODY... now, i admit that most of the shows in the past haven't been intensive with tips and techniques because i often get lost in just the fun of fishing... but i'm making a concerted effort this season to focus more on the tips while retaining the fun and recreational nature of the show... so stay tuned!"
357004,LeXXington,2009-06-30 01:27:00,1928,"Welcome Mike,  Wish I could watch it..  sadly WFN is only offered if you get all the sports package..  With 2 kids it was family package or sports. I lost"
357010,Mike D from Lunkerville,2009-06-30 01:36:00,14, lunkerville.com my friend.. you can watch all the shows for free on the internet... even at work!
357013,danbouck,2009-06-30 01:40:00,4380, Thanks for the link!
357035,Greencoachdog,2009-06-30 03:50:00,8163,"  Anyone, please feel free to PM me if you don't already know my views on commercialized television fishing shows...  it seems some folks on this board get quite a bit skanky when the truth is told about ""TV fishin'""  , I wonder how long they would last on one of my construction sites?... 15 minutes?..."
357402,GBW,2009-07-01 03:41:00,8460,"Welcome to the site Mike D, any time you want to hop in a 14' tinny with a 8HP Honda on the back at Four Mile Lake you let me know.  Hey if I take the 17'6"" with the 115HP on the back I think we would have issues as the lake has HUGE rocks.  Any time, I'm game though to get out (and a few others here on this board on the same lake I'm sure would show up too) so feel free to contact me (PM).  The DVD ad's need some work but all in all, the show is great, keep on doing what you are doing.  Cheers Mike D ""and you get respect""  Geoff"
357422,bigugli,2009-07-01 10:52:00,6138,"You could hook up with any one of over 100 real characters on this site, Mike D. They would treat you good and have a real hoot with you. Regardless of our wannabee fantasies, we're mostly your average guy/gal who has this silly obsession for chasing slimy critters."
357470,tizfun,2009-07-01 15:01:00,292,"I for one, enjoy the show. It's everyday people, real fishing with boats most can afford.  This show tells it like it is and it's nice to see local areas being fished... Not like others where they hide the locations. If you don't like the show, change the channel... IT'S THAT EASY !!! ... That's why we have so many channels on TV's.. One for everybody's liking...  Enjoy the show. Looking forward to many more seasons..  Tiz"
357474,Rich,2009-07-01 15:08:00,3927,I understand why the show exists... I just find it boring as hell
357491,Jonny,2009-07-01 16:21:00,1380,"Some people love reality shows, others don't.  There's sometimes something to be said for unscripted entertainment.  In ""professional"" fishing shows (no knock on Lunkerville, I just mean serious fishing) you know 3/4 of the time what is going to be said. I suppose you could say that could get boring too.  Personally, I seldom watch fishing shows or read fishing magazines. I used to, but not any more.  I guess I'd rather be out there doing.  I even thought that getting into this OFC site would be ho-hum. Well I was wrong about that."
357512,tonyle87,2009-07-01 18:24:00,26,"No Probs Mike, Can you do me a favor and give me a shout out on ur next show. THANKS"
357516,tonyle87,2009-07-01 18:32:00,26,<<future celeb
357517,JohnF,2009-07-01 18:34:00,3494," So I guess that would be a resounding pre-emptive ""no"" in case he was thinking of inviting you to be on the show as someone here suggested?  JF"
328482,john_C,2009-04-10 06:05:00,12,"Oh ,, Too correct my past reply... I got Charlie Moore Confused with Dave Mercer...  Couldn't understand why people were bashing him.. Now that I've corrected myself, I agree.. Charlie Moore is a goof LOl... Dave Mercer i think is the most informative show out there now."
328513,GBW,2009-04-10 13:38:00,8460,LMAO!  She would kill me...
328519,Handlebarz,2009-04-10 14:06:00,3790,   LOL I dont know how you could confuse the two but I bet Dave will just LAUGH IT OFF
328531,wkrp,2009-04-10 14:50:00,656,"If you don`t like it , don`t watch it. I don`t think its neccessary to smash it or him."
328547,PatrickGG,2009-04-10 16:36:00,562,"I like Lunkerville, my fav episode is the one where he walks Central Park pond and lands a 5 pound Largie."
328649,duber,2009-04-11 00:01:00,220,"I'll watch it.My fav episode was when he had the stag fishing party for his buddie on that little bass pond.Even had a couple ""entertainers"" in a boat fishing.Now thats the real deal.Some how I'm not sure I learnt any new techniques from that show but I had a smile on my face while watching."
328692,Garry2Rs,2009-04-11 01:29:00,1425,"Did you see the Lunkerville episode where they had a bachelor party for the producer? First they're doing shots of Tequila, then they pile into small boats and go fishing... They have a couple of bikini clad girls driving another boat around passing out beer... I figured they would be off the air after that, but I guess not...HAHAHA"
356574,Mike D from Lunkerville,2009-06-29 01:29:00,14,"Hey Guys,  Nice site you have here!  I just found it and saw that you were discussing my show, so I thought I would chime in.  I realize Lunkerville is not your average fishing show, so for those of you who don't like it after one or 2 viewings, watch it a few more times. It's obvious I'm no pro fisherman, but that's kind of the concept for the show: the non-expert host gets taught how to fish by his real people guests.  I have a ton of fun doing the show and I think I'm actually learning some things too  It's funny... I often get the same initial reaction from viewers that some of you have: ""How in the hell does this idiot have his own fishing show?""  or ""That Mike D. sucks!""... but give it a chance.  A lot of those viewers have gotten back to me to say they really enjoy the show now.  We're doing something that no one else is doing by featuring everyday anglers as guests... and you never know: you or your buddy might be on the show next week!  Thanks for watching and special thanks to those who appreciate the show.  We're on our 5th season and loving it!  Mike D."
356583,tonyle87,2009-06-29 01:41:00,26,"I enjoy your show Mike, keep up the good work."
356596,BillM,2009-06-29 02:00:00,17367,"There are worse shows on WFN.  What about the dude that went to Bermuda or something, I think they showed about 3 mins of fishing where a guy nails a tarpon and it swims through a wackload of mangroves and he tries forever to get it out.  I don't care about the plane ride, or the fact that you had to paddle 3 miles through a river to catch grunts all day...  Worst.....show.....ever."
356599,Jonny,2009-06-29 02:09:00,1380,"If Lunkerville is on satellite, can someone point me to the right channel?  I'd rather try watching a few episodes on TV than on the computer. Sounds like an interesting show with lots of local colour, kind of like some of the travel shows where the host (usually a young guy) goes to places he knows very little about and is clued in by meeting and establishing a rapport with the local people."
356601,Mike D from Lunkerville,2009-06-29 02:16:00,14,"thank you sheepheadmaster!  ""There are worse shows on WFN""... so you're saying we have a chance Bill!  Jocko,  you can get WFN on the following systems:  Rogers Personal TV ch 426 Bell ExpressVu ch 419 Star Choice ch 458 Shaw Cable ch 152  in the USA DISH Network ch 394 Verizon Ch 317 & ch 597"
356615,danbouck,2009-06-29 02:45:00,4380,"I saw a couple episodes a while back and enjoyed it. The central park ( i believe) episode was good. Sadly I don't get WFN anymore.  and Mike, You may just like this site if you stick around. You learn something new every day here. Example: read my last thread about the effects of not wearing sunscreen in the boat."
356621,BillM,2009-06-29 03:03:00,17367,"Hey Mike, my initial post was a compliment  It's nice to see the everyday average guy out fishing.  I love the wild exotic shows that WFN has, but I do enjoy the grassroots stuff just as much.  I do however think you need a few episodes filmed in Canada"
356627,markiemark70,2009-06-29 03:14:00,158,"Well I just watched the NYC episode and I thought it was great. Good concept, and fascinating to see that there are great fishing oppurtunities in a city of 8 million. Really enjoyed that and even the crazy guy at the end. I think a toronto show is in order!!  Cheers"
356639,JohnF,2009-06-29 03:48:00,3494," Of course it may also screw him up totally for his tv show. What if he goes away thinking all downhome Canuck fisherpersons are like us. Sheesh! We're about as normal as Canucks eating grits. This weekend, fer instance, he learned that bass actually suck and that bluegills are just toothless piranha.  I've only seen one show, and that one had Mariko on it. So, Mike, what do you look like?  I think I may have in fact seen two episodes. The other was with a woman and her daughter showing him their fave fishin' hole. It was kinda fun seeing folks catching fish without wearing Nascar shirts, or rippin' around in/on a go-faster bassboat. It was during the free month of May thingy. I've actually just paid for WFN this weekend so I'll watch it again soon.  JF"
356655,Mike D from Lunkerville,2009-06-29 04:31:00,14,"we're scheduling shows in the montreal and toronto areas so look out!... the stupid guy from the states is coming to canada!  and... if you want to be on the show and you're not a professional fisherman, shoot me an email... but remember, we're going to your honey hole, fishing on your boat, with your tackle and you're giving up some of your secret techniques... so be ready to piss off a few of your friends!  i've already received a bunch of invites from WFN viewers to fish in canada, but we're looking for even more potential guests to cull from, so give me a shout if you want to go fishing... and if you have some video to send me, that's even better... we have a ""home videos from lunkerville"" segment of the show where we feature viewer videos and then ask them to be on the show."
356657,Cudz,2009-06-29 04:33:00,2652,"""I'm Mike D. and I get respect Your cash and your jewelry is what I expect!"" Name that song.  Can you do it Mike D?  Dude I really don't mind your show.  Keep up the good work.  We are all just jealous that you have your own show and we don't.  I loved the show when you on Erie and you were in like 50ft of water and you started throwing out the topwater frog (or whatever it was).  That was pretty much my favourite thing ever.  Well that and the show where you fished that tiny little dam with that fishermom.  That was funny too.  lol!"
356659,Cudz,2009-06-29 04:36:00,2652," You can come fish out of my 1960 12'(actually 11'8) tinner with a 4.5 hp.  It leaks a bunch and is very tippy, and I fish on Simcoe (notoriously big waves) but I catch fish.  That would be a sweet episode.  The camera man would be in tight quaters for sure.  haha!"
356723,lhousesoccer,2009-06-29 13:20:00,442,"I think it's a great show.  So refreshing, compared to all the cookie-cutter, sponsor-laden good 'ole boy ""bassin"" shows in their big rigs and bright shirts.  He's done a couple shows on Lake Champlain, near where I live and mostly fish, and it's great seeing just regular guys out trying to figure it out like the rest of us.  Sometimes you catch them, sometimes you don't.  The show won a pretty prestigious TV Award, I saw on another fishing forum (NYBASS.com).  Check it out ...  NYBASS.com  Lunkerville Thread  TV Award website  Press Release"
356732,NAW,2009-06-29 13:44:00,4022,I watched a full season of the show on Rogers on Demand.  I didn't mind it.  I found it pretty funny to watch.  Didn't learn anything though.
356764,Jonny,2009-06-29 15:21:00,1380," Thanks, Mike, that one does it for me! I'll be tuning in.  The admin on this board could probably set you up with contacts on Nipissing (North Bay/Sturgeon Falls - about 4 hrs drive N of Toronto).  Another place I would suggest is Kincardine (at the base of the Bruce Peninsula on Lake Huron). Fishing near the big nuclear plant would probably be a hoot, and you'd love the town, especially if you're there on a summer Saturday for the weekly Scottish pipe band parade. I could probably set you up with a contact - one of the guys who works at the plant.  Just a couple of thoughts in case some shows in Canada intrigue you."
356980,Mike D from Lunkerville,2009-06-30 00:28:00,14," that of course is ""paul revere"" from the beastie boys... good tune... i actually had the pleasure to work with boys in the late 90's... very cool dudes... i edited a 30 minute promotional video for ""hello nasty"" that had each of them play infomercial pitchmen... i think they actually aired it on late night TV with an 800# for their album... mike d sold an exercise machine, MCA sold a get rich quick scheme and Ad-Rock sold a juicer... anyone remeber seeing that?... good times.  thanks guys for your support and emails"
356989,Handlebarz,2009-06-30 00:46:00,3790,Welcome Aboard Mike  your show is a nice change from some others when your out doing what alot of peopel can do not like some bigger shows that have a full time guide for every trip and only hit a area in prime time. Keep it up maybe one day we can get you on Lake St.Clair I am not a master bass fisherman at all I have not gone out for them in years but still catch them all summer I bet there are some here who would be a hoot to shoot a show with I for one would recomend BBR Or just rich he is a hoot to watch and fishes your style.  Cheers Mike
356992,johnnyb,2009-06-30 00:55:00,3413,"Welcome aboard indeed, Mike!  I've never seen the show, but I am beyond intrigued now...I like the sound of it -- less sponsors, more real people.    I also think Mike looks like TJ...just a bit...anybody?"
328281,Mr Twister,2009-04-09 18:46:00,71,Now I have seen it all! I love Scotty Martin fishing challenge and even a few others but this guy is 101 basic or even less then that! Wow
328284,kemper,2009-04-09 18:48:00,2232,i once watched him hand line smelts for 30 minutes.  i have never seen such a bad fishing show
328288,e-z-out,2009-04-09 18:53:00,1052,i just did and man is this guy slow but we all have to start sooner or later and what better way to star fishing but with your own fishing show lol
328298,ADB,2009-04-09 19:16:00,444,"I used to hate Lunkerville for all the reasons you guys have mentioned.  Now, though, I like to watch the people on the show and see their local fishing holes. To me, it's kinda interesting.  I just ignore Mike now."
328302,GBW,2009-04-09 20:16:00,8460,It's much better than the Moore show...
328310,MCTFisher9120,2009-04-09 20:43:00,3761,Good show. local waters normal boats and heck people like us.
328312,Lunker777,2009-04-09 20:53:00,866,"hahah Im kind of up in the air on this show. The first one I watched has "" Fishermom "" on it... and I mean... yea thats cool that the Mom was so into it... but they went fishing for like blue gills and that was about it... A fishing show ? really ?  As someone already said... at least its better then "" Chaaaalie Mooore """
328316,BassAsin,2009-04-09 21:03:00,806,"ignore mike is right, and get to hear what some small town folks use and their reasoning behind it, as opposed to a sponsors reasons for using certain lures  couldnt agree moore!    it is absolutely terrible    i'm sure he knows his show sucks too but hes laughin all the way to bank!"
328318,john_C,2009-04-09 21:10:00,12,"I have to agree with ADB a couple replies ago... It's interesting to see other local fishing holes, just to see what fish are swimming in other local waters.... Besides, these are the areas where the majority of people into the sport of fishing can go. Besides... At least his show is more realistic, rather than a lot of the other shows who always go up to northern lakes making us all envy when they bring in catches of 50 - 100 walleyes a day.... If only we could all just pick up and go up to Great Slave Lake or Temagami as frequent as those host can....  And i actually find Charilie Moore one of the better and more informative shows,... What wrong with Charlie Moore!!!! Beside the Demonic Laugh lol"
328319,BassAsin,2009-04-09 21:14:00,806,sorry drop-shot but i get to fish temagami at least 30 times a year!      and  i lived in cochrane for a few years and trust me when i say go barbless for wallies up there 50-100 is not out of the question but after a while almost boring believe it or not.    oh and the partidge hahah 10 guys could take home 50 a day for a month straight and still not hurt the population
328337,MCTFisher9120,2009-04-09 21:44:00,3761,"Why does nobody like the show. Sure he's not all professional but why the heck does a fishing show need to be all serious, again all about meeting locals(in there area) and having a good time out on the water...why not try to watch a few episotes eh http://www.lunkerville.com/watchshow.html"
328349,ohhenrygsr,2009-04-09 22:17:00,947,Joe Jordon is my Idol.  Check out the rest of his Fishing Tube video's

328360,Cudz,2009-04-09 22:53:00,2652,I don't mind lunkerville.  He might be the crappiest fisherman ever but I really don't mind it. Then again I also like the Charlie Moore Fishing show. Don't know why but I don't mind it at all.
328385,JEREMY,2009-04-09 23:57:00,300,"Lunkerville i can stand.The new charlie moore show i cant,but the old beat charlie moore show i liked.The new show reminds me of the dimestore fisherman."
328393,MCTFisher9120,2009-04-10 00:28:00,3761,"I never have herd of this ""charlie moore"" show...can i get a link to a episote anybody"
328406,Grimace,2009-04-10 00:56:00,2020,I think Lunkerville is more about people and personalities.  For that I really like it.   He is a likable fellow and he gets a quick rapport with his partners.  It is more of an Americana show about a great American pastime.  He seems to be able to catch the spirit of the personalities that he has on.  Remember folks it doesn't always have to be about the nuts and bolts of fishing.  I think he has put together a smart show about people.
328411,bucktail,2009-04-10 01:07:00,1857,"Grimace has it right on the head.  Its for that reason I like it, laid back ,talking to locals and old timers, meeting new people in new places!"
328439,GBW,2009-04-10 03:07:00,8460,"BINGO!   We have a winner... Mike D does a great job with what he is trying to do.  Be the traveling ""I don't know xxxx"" angler asking for tip on some small local lakes and makeing a show of it. Charile Moore on the other hand is being Charlie Moore and his old show (a rip off of the Scott Martin Challange) was better then the new garbage they show now. Can I borrow a few folks that work in the fishing show industry this summer to produce a GBW Outdoor show to see if it's better then the C.M. show?  HEHE  That would be fun..."
328440,bigugli,2009-04-10 03:14:00,6138,I like Lunkerville. Every day people enjoying the sport. No big flash and pizazz. It's interesting.
328441,Cudz,2009-04-10 03:16:00,2652,I say go for it.  (Just make sure your wife is as good looking as Charlie's)
