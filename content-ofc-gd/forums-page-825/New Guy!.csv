To give you guys a lil background I just took up fishing a few months ago with my soon to be nephew and got hooked ( pardon the pun ) and now i drop a line every other day or so at any spot that looks enticing!  I hope to learn a ton from these forums! That said, heres to keeping the community going!  Also i just got a cottage in Picton ( Bay of Quinte ) so ill be posting reports from time to time as well as reports from a few local spots. Any tips and advice is always greatly appreciated.  Cheers!  Jip  Lol disregard the post i made in the announcement forums.  <------ noob"

A little tip......the gang loves pictures  aka  fish porn     I do hope that you enjoy your time here and look forward to reading about your adventures while ""learning"" to fish.   Picton is a popular area with many during the fall, I am sure they will appreciate the info that you may be able to share."

357162,bigugli,2009-06-30 16:04:00,6138,Welcome.  And what's the address of that cottage again  Lots of helpful info and unusual characters here.  Don't worry about the Dawg. He just barks a lot ( I think the Mrs pulled his fangs ages back  )
