343901,super dave,2009-05-22 12:51:00,323,Hello Everyone. Does anyone know the Owen Sound area that can help me out?  I will be there for a night for work and was hoping to wet a line after work.  I'll go for anything.  I steelhead but main in the east and have never ventured to the Georgian bay tribs.   Sydenham still holding some?   Or is there a small lake nearby where I can launch the tube for a couple of hours for pike or walleye?  Any tips and suggestions would be welcome.  Thanks!

343919,Bob,2009-05-22 13:32:00,370,"Haven't been there for some years but there's a gorgeous stretch of river below Inglis Falls that always held a nice mix of pan sized rainbows, specks and browns.  The Pottawatomi River west of town holds some nice browns as well.  Any weedy bay north of town on the east side of the peninsula should have pike.  As I said, it's been a while but that's how it was."

357426,Governator,2009-07-01 11:38:00,879,BUMP!!!!  I'm heading to Owen Sound this weekend.  Anyone know of any shore fishing possibilities around this time?  Even in to Georgian Bay from shore?  There are several small beaches in the area and 1 dock that I know of.  Cheers Jason
