There were 8 of us and at some points double and triple headers in different boats at the same time, most around 21/2 or 3lbs with the biggest at 4.7lbs, it was beauty. All trolling the mouth of the river, possession limits adhered too and allot put back. 1 taged pickerel was caught and tag sent to the MNR in New Liskeard. Pictures will tell the story...   my first day   average size   some stringers put together for a photo   Pub lunch - wings,fresh cut fries,pickerel and refreshing beverages ""oh yeah""          Weather was good, not much wind, a bit too hot mid-day for being in the boat but most of the action was morning and early evening and at times allot of other boats came by to try their luck.  It was a great trip with a good time had by all.  Hope you enjoy... Bill."

356748,BillM,2009-06-29 14:27:00,17367,Nice job Bill!  I was a few miles south of you on the Ottawa River in Temiskaming on Sat..  nothing but tiny saugers and one small pickerel the entire day.  I guess I know where all the big fish are.  What did you get them on?  cranks?  harnesses?  Ours came on nice sized chubs and a few on the leech.
