Since my divorce took away my last boat, I'm now in the market at a used (new to me) again..  I'm looking at a couple and are powered by either motor  1996 150 hp Fast Strike and the other with a 1997 175 hp Intruder.  What are your opinions on these motors ?? Would or have you owned one before ?? I know the 1998 Fitch and the Opitmax in this year are not good, so any comments and advice would be appreciated..  Thanks, Tiz"

703580,Garnet,2012-06-07 14:13:00,2056,I had the 175 rude. As mentioned VRO were problem. Power Packs $300 were problem. Think they are cheaper after market. Before blowing money on power pack the cheapest sensor is under your dash about $14 it controls your beeper.  At the front of the motor are 2 small boxes. Bose relays about $4 at Auto Parts store $15 at marina. They control your trim. If your motor goes up and not down switch them around. They both need to be plugged in.  The 150 Strike is same motor everything applies.

703858,Billy Bob,2012-06-08 12:15:00,5865,My 1985 50hp VRO Johnson is still going strong.......love not having to mix oil.
703865,craigdritchie,2012-06-08 13:17:00,1586,"+1 to comments above. The 150 and 175 are the same engine, just tuned differently.  Don't touch a Ficht at any price."
703898,Bernie,2012-06-08 15:12:00,3190,I have nothing but good things to say about my Ficht Craig. It's been a very good engine.
703947,ecmilley,2012-06-08 17:59:00,2163,yes Bernie but you also know that we turn wrenches for a living and understand the engineers came out with a pm schedule for a reason and we will usually follow it on our own equipment cause who wants to work on there equipment when everyone else is fisihing
703961,craigdritchie,2012-06-08 19:05:00,1586,"Then you're one of the lucky ones, Bernie. That seems to be the thing with Ficht - while some owners have great experiences with them, many more have nothing but headaches. There doesn't seem to be any middle ground."
