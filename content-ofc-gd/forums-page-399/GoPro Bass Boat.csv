703920,Stoty,2012-06-08 16:13:00,2910,"Finally got all the GoPro mounts installed on my boat! It will allow me to film from multiple angles!  Suction cup mount on the side for a ""release shot"" camera   Passenger side wide angle of front deck   Engine mounted, looking forward at the entire boat   Trolling motor mount, looking back at the entire boat   Angled up looking at the front deck for sweet ""upward"" footage   Mounted on an telescopic 6ft pole getting a high 170 wide angle shot of the front 2/3 of the boat!

703926,Harrison,2012-06-08 16:27:00,2202,I put one on the center seat too so you can sit on the deck and have a close up to show baits etc.  Mix these gopro shots with a hand HD cam and you got some cool videos!
703927,Dan668,2012-06-08 16:32:00,1120,Sweet
703931,iFish4real,2012-06-08 16:48:00,386,holy cow...all I can say
703934,Terry,2012-06-08 17:00:00,14456,now you just need one mounted on the net and you have a complete set
703938,BucktownAngler,2012-06-08 17:15:00,582,are those just mounts? or do you have like 8 cameras setup for each one
703944,lew,2012-06-08 17:43:00,12766,"Great looking set-up Stoty, but I'm assuming you'll be using a tether strap incase the suction mount pops loose ??  I like that telescopic pole at the rear, does that just sit in the hole for the rear seat ??"
703952,cityfisher,2012-06-08 18:08:00,959,hardcore setup.. i hope your sponsered by go pro!! all those cameras aint cheap!
703982,iFish4real,2012-06-08 19:51:00,386,hope you're gonna share some videos
703985,Broker,2012-06-08 20:25:00,482,Thats unreal!
703988,cynmar,2012-06-08 20:42:00,169,"That's excellent, it is a good thing that professional fishermen that take video footage never have to pee over the side of the boat though.  I couldn't stand being on camera so much.  Bill"
704004,woodenboater,2012-06-08 21:17:00,2277,can't wait to see the vid you put together from this setup ! just no crazy jump cuts ok
704007,Handlebarz,2012-06-08 21:34:00,3790,Looks great i had the same question as Lew are you using a tether if so please show pics of that setup.  I just got mine from the OFC classifieds and will be adding mounts to my boat also you gave me some great ideas thanks.
704009,Stoty,2012-06-08 21:37:00,2910," You got it Lew! It's wedged in the rear seat mount. I have braided line tied around the camera/suction cup as a ""safety net""."
704010,Stoty,2012-06-08 21:39:00,2910, That's why there's only 1 side of the boat with a suction mount! ;-)
704017,Mike the Pike,2012-06-08 21:57:00,3421,Ok Boat is shiny and I like your ride btw.Cool set up with the cameras but now its time for some fish slime.  I expect a helluva report in the near future.  MTP
704036,Stoty,2012-06-08 23:10:00,2910,I'm hoping to have one! trying to find the time to get out with all the OT I've been doing! Sucks not being able to get out!
