Next was a visit to Walmart where we visited the greeting card section.  I picked out 2 wedding anniversary cards, showed them to Norma and then we headed home.  No way would I drop $3-$5 on a greeting card when we need to be saving up gas money for our August trip to NW Ontario.  Next year we might go to a higher class greeting card store.  #55 will be more special than 54.  Lew, I know you're hanging in there, but you're not closing in on us."

We're still practically newlyweds and have a long ways to go to catch you guys Connie, we'll be celebrating 46 years this October.  Diane just recently took a 2 week cruise to Hawaii with a bunch of her girlfriends and left me home to pooch sit, so I told her that takes care of any further anniversary gifts for her for a  long time....a VERY long time"
