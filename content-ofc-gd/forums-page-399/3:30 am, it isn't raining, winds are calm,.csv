704127,mike rousseau,2012-06-09 11:37:00,4661,I'm giving the walleyes a chance to wake up and shake out the cob webs...
704128,Big Cliff,2012-06-09 11:45:00,6899,"Well, I'm back LOL, nice thing about living right on the lake, drive boat into cradle, flip switch, boat is in the boat house. Tomorrow is looking like a much nicer day, guess I'll take a shot at the honey do list for the rest of the day, doesn't look like it is going to get much better for a while."
704142,lew,2012-06-09 12:49:00,12766," So, how was the fishin ??"
704193,Big Cliff,2012-06-09 15:44:00,6899," Well, I can tell you where they aren't    Only three fish for a couple of hours fishing, all small. I'm guessing they didn't like the rain either LOL.  Talked to a couple of guys fishing the tournament, they all said the same thing ""SLOW"" and these guys are the pros so if they aren't catching I don't feel so bad."
