704199,Rizzo,2012-06-09 16:17:00,4754,most expensive fish catch ever!
704230,jigsnreels,2012-06-09 18:13:00,133,Too bad they can't send the bill to the genius who threw it in there...
704343,GYPSY400,2012-06-10 12:47:00,191, And worth every penny.. These snakeheads would be absolutely devastating to the Canadian Eco system.
704366,mercman,2012-06-10 14:18:00,7054," Come face to face with a 50""Musky or some of the huge Northern Pike, i dont think it would stand much of a chance. In all seriousness, i think we should get over the panic,and start to prepare for the eventual reality of Snakehead and Asian Carp entry into our water systems. Looks like its gonna be a fact of life"
704399,Jacob,2012-06-10 17:37:00,186, They might not take a chance if they don't know what it is though.
704412,iFish4real,2012-06-10 18:24:00,386,wuuu...that's scary  good job
704416,rmarentette,2012-06-10 18:43:00,124,"Just this past week in the letters to the Editor in the Windsor Star a local business man was saying we shouldn't spend money on preventing the Asian Carp. The genius went on to explain how it could be a financial windfall as a food export which would lead to job creation. This idiot probably doesn't understand (or care) how much money and jobs are generated by sports-fishing and tourism, just in Ontario. I'm afraid that Mercman could be right if we have people with this kind of mentality who could violate the law by introducing them purposely as part of some mad get rich quick scheme! Thanks for the link!"
704419,mercman,2012-06-10 18:50:00,7054," If it swam by a hungry musky or pike, i dont think that not knowing what it was, would come into play.These 2 preditors eat first and ask questions later"
