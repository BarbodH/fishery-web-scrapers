704068,Djeep,2012-06-09 00:56:00,199,little rainbow trout it looks like. treat em with care so they can go larger
704072,dsukh,2012-06-09 01:03:00,24,"Awesome!  Used barbless hook, and fish never left water until he hopped right when I was talking the picture.  Haha, had a great time"
704091,GreenCanada,2012-06-09 02:35:00,375,Nice little Rainbow. You're likely to find a lot of them this time of year. But don't go telling many people where!
704094,BillM,2012-06-09 02:45:00,17367," You really don't want to be targeting those fish, they are steelhead smolts...  Let them get big before you put hooks into them.."
704096,dsukh,2012-06-09 03:01:00,24," Haha agree, although I'm sure nobody intentionally targets smolts."
704098,BillM,2012-06-09 03:19:00,17367," You give people way too much credit, lol."
704099,dsukh,2012-06-09 03:23:00,24,"Lol well hopefully that's the case anyways, now that I found the small ones hopefully I'll be able to find the bigger ones. New to fly fishing lol, any tips will much much appreciated (:"
