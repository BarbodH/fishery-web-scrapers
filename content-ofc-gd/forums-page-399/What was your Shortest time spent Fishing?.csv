704372,lew,2012-06-10 14:39:00,12766, And he reminded me of it every chance he got too Brian  Just one more happy memory of my bro
704257,Leecher,2012-06-09 22:17:00,7832,"Hi everyone,  Been some time since my last report and know I've missed some great reports these past few weeks... I apologize    been busy tackling the todo list at home and not much time for the Internet  The list is getting shorter but not as fast as I would like  Want to ask the community a question and here it is....  What was your shortest time spent fishing for any species of fish on any body of water?  From shore or a boat, doesn't matter  The reason I ask this question is that today, something out of this world  happen to me while targeting specks... Left unexpectedly since I limit out    Lets just say that I was at the right place, at the right time, and the pokadots were hungry  There was no plan for me to go out fishing today, as the todo list was still in the back of my mind but somehow, found the strength to set it aside and go for it     In a nutshell... best decision I've ever made  Left home late    and I mean late    Past 8h30am... got to destination around 10h00am... Gosh darn traffic    Once at destination, texted my Mrs and got the rod out and set it up with a slip bobber type rig that I made to target the bottom of the water column  What I didn't know was that those pesky pokadots were stack like a cord of wood right in front of where I had setup  Went 10 for 10 today (ex. 10 cast 10 specks )  Nothing big... 9"" to 10"" long     All pan size from a put & take lake in case you ask why I kept them   All specks were deep hooked and even if I wanted to release them... their survival rate was like 1% chance  The frenzie lasted 30 minutes roughly    one of the shortest time spent on the shoreline for me   and then had to leave this beautiful place   Thus the question I ask you?  Some more details...  When I got setup and caught a couple beauties... a car was passing by and seen me with a speck on the end of the line... they made a U turn and got setup not far from me with bobber setup thinking they could catch'em like I was..... NOT    weren't catching ZIP  After I had caught 5 of them while they were setting up... this guy comes up to me and says (hope this language is OK with the mods) ""god dam ""mon grand t'en poingne en masse icitte"" c'est quoi tu uze pour les poigner     By that time I had 9 caught and I knew it wouldn't take long to get the 10th   I explained to him the setup I had and showed him... I also caught my 10th and gave him what I was using to catch them  He also ask where I was from and told him from Gatineau... funny thing is  this guy works at a local store (Technique Chasse Peche on Maloney Boulevard) and said to drop by with some of the rigs I make (slip bobber type) that he would be happy to sell them  While I was packing up after I had set them up with my rigs... they caught 3  Any hoot, this was one outstanding moment that I will not ever forget and wanted to share.... so enough of the rambling.... here's the group hug (money shot   )    P.S.  You guys ever seen a speckle congregation like this?    Hope you enjoy!!! Sorry for the long winding story... Tight lines Trout Junkie  ********************************************************************** Update - Just made this video... let me know if you like the tune?   <embed width=""600"" height=""361"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" allowFullscreen=""true"" allowNetworking=""all"" wmode=""transparent"" src=""http://static.photobucket.com/player.swf"" flashvars=""file=http%3A%2F%2Fvid732.photobucket.com%2Falbums%2Fww321%2Fleechman1%2FSoftwater%2520Season%25202012%2FTrout%2520Hunting%2520-%2520June%25209%25202012%2FSpeckleHuntJun92012.mp4"">"

704279,dave524,2012-06-10 00:43:00,4508,"Nice pan sized specs  Been a long time since the limit was more than 5 here, think when I was a teen it was something like 15 fish or 1 fish and 10 pounds, but that was long ago when the MNR was the Dept of Lands and Forests"
704288,Garnet,2012-06-10 01:08:00,2056,I have 2 that come to mind. The first ice fishing Quinte 2 buddy's started drilling 6 holes  and when they finished the last hole I had 4 wallys on the ice.  And I caught 9 smallies on 14 cast to win a major 3 day tournament. Good memory's.
704294,Moosebunk,2012-06-10 01:19:00,3970,That's crazy awesome Jacques!!!  Those size specks IMO would make the absolute best eaters too.  What a day for ya bud!!!
704298,Blue Lk,2012-06-10 01:30:00,337,"Looks like the perfect day,with fishing like that you still have lots of time to work on the dreaded honey do list."

704310,Cudz,2012-06-10 02:18:00,2652,"Hey Jacques I have not been on here much but I recognized the man in the pic but not the name.  What happened to Leechman? By the way, I still have ""little woodie"". Would you like me to send him back to you?"
704314,pike slayer,2012-06-10 03:21:00,1177,a couple of winters ago a buddy and i fished a laker lake wheres no live bait and it was 8:30am when we drilled our 2 holes. we only used a jigging rod each caught 8 lakers(kept our limit) jumped on the sleds and hopped to the next lake over for specks drilled our 2 holes again no live bait and caught 10specks(kept our limit) and we were packing up at 9:30am and sledded back to his house by 10:15 and we were like so what do we do for the rest of the day. another time my buddy and i were up at our buddies camp he was cooking breakfast and was like go see if we can catch a speck or 2 for breakfast. 45min later we came back with 10specks and we caught 18 in total. after breakfast we went out and got another 3 specks.  another time right before a bad storm me and 2 buddies caught 55 pike in 4hours we stopped cause there was lots of lightening. the rest of the trip was a write off being in a tent on an island in a wind/rain storm for the next 2 days
704318,asdve23rveavwa,2012-06-10 03:49:00,2690,Speck-tacular Jacques. Days like that make up for the ones where pepe makes an appearance
704323,lew,2012-06-10 09:39:00,12766,"My brother was a great bass & pickeral fisherman,  but seldom fished for muskies unless he came out with me.  We headed over to Chemong one day and I pulled into a favorite little bay. Ed went to the back of the boat and while I was dropping the troll motor he made his very 1st cast of the day and Bang, he nails a musky.  Well he says, there's not much to catching a musky, what else do you wanna try ??   :lol:"
704340,Ralph Field,2012-06-10 12:34:00,1018,"On the Thames river south of London I caught 6 walleyes on 9 casts, which only took about 15 minutes. I returned home , picked up my steelhead gear and went to the mouth of the Maitland River and fished until dark without a single hit."
704345,Handlebarz,2012-06-10 12:50:00,3790,Not sure of it was the shortest but a few years back I had my daughter out musky fishing we got out I set the lines and she tossed her Tim bits I pulled tge lines and headed in. Well less then a hour. Heck I thought the marina would offer a free launch for another time as we were out there a lot and recommended a lot of people there but they would not. I guess that's one of the reasons it went under and new owners are there now.
704346,Handlebarz,2012-06-10 12:51:00,3790,Lew I always like that story but it's better in person to see your face when telling it you add a lot of expersion to it
704347,Rizzo,2012-06-10 12:57:00,4754,"2 days ago we pulled out from our island campsite which faced the south, took one cast south, then turned to take a cast north...to see the major storm basically on us already. Turned back around and boated right back 100 feet to the site. So I guess that was around 30 seconds. Got skunked to boot."
704351,jigsnreels,2012-06-10 13:34:00,133,"Probably the time I went out for an afternoon session and realized on the way that I'd forgotten my license, and an MNR vehicle happened to be parked at the spot I was planning to fish at, just to seal the deal."
704358,ketchenany,2012-06-10 13:44:00,3229,"Went to a favorite spot on the pine just as the sun broke, walked in to a beautiful looking hole. Lots of overhang. Took a  couple of casts and got follows from under the dead trees (looked promising). Looked to my right and here comes a beaver, I just froze! As he swam by me he slapped his tail so hard it was like a gun going off!  Home time!"
704363,phatpelkey,2012-06-10 14:06:00,78,"i would have to say a few winters ago, i was perch fishing and has 50 nice ones on the ice in under 30 mins, 3 days in a row!!"
