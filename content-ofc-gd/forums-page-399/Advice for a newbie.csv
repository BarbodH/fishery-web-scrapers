I recently got a boat and I'm planning on going fishing with some friends on Georgian Bay between Parry Sound and Point au Baril the next long weekend at the and of June. None of us has ever fished in the area so, would anybody here be so kind to share some spots with us?  Lots of thanks!!!"
703339,Musky or Specks,2012-06-06 16:40:00,2710,Find some weeds you'll find some fish. Your new here so I'll let you know until you've been a sharing part of the community for a while guys are not going to give up their spots.
703342,BillM,2012-06-06 16:42:00,17367,Also have a hydro map or you'll be donating bits and pieces of your lower unit/prop to the lake
703360,iFish4real,2012-06-06 18:19:00,386," sounds fair enough, I'd be happy only with some areas too"
703361,iFish4real,2012-06-06 18:20:00,386, Thanks!!!
703363,Acountdeleted,2012-06-06 18:26:00,2562,"You won't need specifics, I had a girlfriend, a few years ago, who worked for Black Sturgeon Park just outside Point Au Barel, when she worked I would grab a canoe and fish the area, the weeds were always chalk full of Bass and Pike. Happy hunting."
703375,Broker,2012-06-06 19:30:00,482,Troll by the edge of weedlines for pike and depending on the temperature fish rocky dropoffs with big worms or leeches for smallmouth
703376,Handlebarz,2012-06-06 19:34:00,3790,Welcome aboard never fished the area your going so I can't help much. Good luck
703377,davey buoy,2012-06-06 19:47:00,5505,That area is full of fish. Use the advise given and you'll do alright!!!
703379,jedimaster,2012-06-06 19:48:00,3472,"Ditto as mik, welcome aboard. In any lake if you find the weeds you will find the fish."
703388,Christopheraaron,2012-06-06 19:56:00,3525,I love that we're already talking about bass on here!
703478,iFish4real,2012-06-07 01:21:00,386,Thank you all!!!  Good bass season to everybody
703481,NANUK,2012-06-07 01:31:00,797,"Stay in marked chanels if doing any speed, That area is full of treacherous rock shoals. Every peice of structure looks ideal to fish but find some weeds close to sharp drop offs"
703565,iFish4real,2012-06-07 13:27:00,386, Thanks!!!
703650,aplumma,2012-06-07 18:35:00,6896,Try husky jerk baits near weedlines with deep water near. You also should target areas were the wind is blowing across the water onto the land it blows the food the baitfish eat on up the food chain. If pencil reeds are present cast thru them and guide your lures thru them the fish are there even if you don't see them. Good luck and welcome to the board. BTW for this wealth of information we want a few pictures.   Art
