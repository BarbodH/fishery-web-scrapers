701595,solopaddler,2012-05-31 18:43:00,8605," Yes indeed. It's 7'2"" rated 4-8lb.  So far I love it. It performs as well as any of the higher end Loomis rods I fish with and in fact has better fittings.  The titanium frame SIC guides on that rod are worth more than what I paid for it.  The only issue will be durability in the long term, but with a lifetime warranty I'm not really worried.  If there could possibly be even the slightest criticism, because the handle is shorter than most the rod feels a teeny bit tip heavy, but I doubt most anglers would even notice that.  I'm pretty sure with the shorter stiffer jigging rods that issue wouldn't exist anyway.  Highly recommended, I'll be getting a couple more myself!"
701597,corvette1,2012-05-31 18:45:00,1765,awesome trip and pictures have a great trip in nakina
701603,misfish,2012-05-31 19:17:00,29133,"It,s places like that, I dream about ever attending. That one spot you mentioned ,MOOSE,you got that right.  Enjoyed the vid very much Mike. Thanks for taking the time to share.  Kudos to Jason,for hook,n up with you and making your adventure,that much more easier,with the transportation."
701617,Twocoda,2012-05-31 20:17:00,4130,"very cool production...""food for the soul"" indeed  Job well done and thanks for sharing the adventure"
701654,danc,2012-05-31 21:36:00,4677,A well documented adventure that was a pleasure to watch Mike. Two thumbs up.
701716,Tomcat,2012-06-01 00:23:00,395,"Another great report Mike. As a 70 year old fisherman, I feel quite lucky to be a member of this board and to be able to live wilderness adventures vicariously through your reports/videos. Thanks for sharing."
701722,asdve23rveavwa,2012-06-01 00:41:00,2690,Cool stuff Mike.  Another wilderness adventure with emphasis on the wild.
701726,mirogak,2012-06-01 00:51:00,387,"Good stuff Mike.  Was waiting for you anticipated report.  Nice attempt at the video too, loved the soundtrack.  And did you say ""4 feet at the shoulders?""  Do they really grow that big?  Miro"
701757,Moosebunk,2012-06-01 03:04:00,3970,"Grinning ear to ear and humming that little diddy the whole way through Mike.  ""THAT'S intense concentration.""  ""I'm a little freaked out right now.""  ""My singing repels every living creature.""  Man... you were cracking me up.  Have enjoyed your reports from the first one, when you left me speechless and mapping out your most epic Albany adventure.  This video was a great first for ya!"
701762,Mike the Pike,2012-06-01 03:21:00,3421,That that was absolutely enjoyable I had no idea you could do so much more with an ATV.   The video was excellent for a new bee.Now does this mean you will be writing and typing less   That was over the top  MTP
701766,trevy727,2012-06-01 03:54:00,351,Nice!
701856,dustycreek,2012-06-01 14:59:00,4,"Really fun edit, and good on you for taking the time to document a trip that not many of us will get to take. I imagine the trout were even sweeter considering the adventure in getting to them, I can just imagine that first bite! Looks like an amazing time, thanks for sharing."
701884,4x4bassin,2012-06-01 16:11:00,1025,"Great video Mike , thanks once again for taking the time to put it together. Great looking spot , just what I like ,tough to get too and nobody around to bother ya !"
701941,troutologist,2012-06-01 18:12:00,951,"What can be said...awesome trip, what an experience.  You're making me homesick for brookie fishing!"
701948,mike rousseau,2012-06-01 18:28:00,4661,awesome...  very cool seeing the efforts you put in to get to your paradise...
702038,lovetofish,2012-06-01 21:58:00,500,Wow! I'm not worthy!!
702090,Pangle,2012-06-02 00:30:00,64,"Great video, it was very entertaining.   What an adventure!"
702259,MJL,2012-06-02 21:49:00,2427,Finally had time to watch the video...Great job on the editing Mike. It's pretty amazing to see all that work you guys had to do to get there. Just loved it
702269,Terry,2012-06-02 22:11:00,14456,great trip great video  keep them coming
702325,speedtroll,2012-06-03 02:11:00,52,Wow  That is what we live for. very  nice. thanks for sharing.  Speed
702437,Walleye'm Fishing,2012-06-03 16:53:00,310,"That's what brookie fishing is all about right there... It's not just about the destination, it's about enjoying the journey as well."
702685,ehg,2012-06-04 13:46:00,2666,"We are lucky that you have been putting up these stellar reports for the last 8 yrs or so. They are way better than any fishing show.  Many, many thanks."
702697,BillM,2012-06-04 14:10:00,17367,Is it August yet Mike?
704377,TennesseeGuy,2012-06-10 15:39:00,957,Beauty of a report.  Great outing.  Thanks Mike.  Good move being camera operator while Jason takes huge risks and moves trees off the trail.
701410,solopaddler,2012-05-31 04:25:00,8605,"As many of you know I recently spent a few days bush whacking for brookies in some pretty rugged terrain on Superiors north shore.  It turned out to be a banner trip, although it was constantly evolving and I never did make it into the lake I had originally intended to.  My buddy Jason who lives in Manitouwadge has a quad with a rack and a lightweight canoe and we put them all to good use.  Ultimately we fished a lake that's been on my radar for over 20 years. It was nice to finally be able to scratch it off the list.  In any case I've put together a video of our little excursion. This is my first attempt ever at piecing together and editing a movie. It's far from perfect and it's clear I have much to learn, but regardless enjoy!   <iframe width=""420"" height=""315"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/ql86V1h0FK8"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>"
701413,bobowski,2012-05-31 04:39:00,360,Awesome report. Fishing in the middle of nowhere without a soul for miles must be so peaceful and tranquil. I cant wait until I get a chance to do that.
701414,Stoty,2012-05-31 05:09:00,2910,Very cool! Would have been an amazing trip! Gets me pumped for my upcoming Algonquin Interior trip!  P.S - Sweet rims on the ATV
701418,manitoubass2,2012-05-31 05:22:00,11391,"Remember my comment about a show involving your adventures???  I'm dead serious, thats it right there. I've never been that entertained from a report, ever.  Thank you very kindly, please do that again. I'll post my footage in return, although it will pale in comparison.  Well done sir, super enjoyable   "
701422,Jet,2012-05-31 06:22:00,364,"Awesome Mike! A epic trip well earned once again. I'm a big fan of video (ask my friends!) because I love going back months, years later to relive the moments. Hope to see more of your fishing adventures on film!"
701430,Gregoire,2012-05-31 10:12:00,1397,Nice report. Thanks for sharing.
701440,woodenboater,2012-05-31 11:24:00,2277,"one word: EPIC !!  great video journal Mike, I'm sure you're poring over topos looking for alternate routes into this body of weater that involves, um, less fording of rivers  curious-during the wolf stalk, what happened to the video ?"
701443,Christopheraaron,2012-05-31 11:26:00,3525,"More, More, More!"
701444,solopaddler,2012-05-31 11:29:00,8605,"  Thanks bud (and to everyone else as well!).  The segment with the wolf was my lame attempt at editing LOL! I added an ""effect"" to the clip. It's supposed to look grainy and old.  I thought it gave the clip a Blair Witch kind of feel, but maybe not."
701451,woodenboater,2012-05-31 11:45:00,2277,"naw, I thought it had that 'camera got dumped in the river while running from canis lupus and this is what I recovered' kinda vibe which is what I guess you were aiming for ?"
701499,Jds63,2012-05-31 13:38:00,1365,"another classic for the archives , same thing happened to me with the wolf stalk years ago in Algonquin, except the wolf came out into the portage and stared me and my buddy down until we made lots of noise, glad it all worked out, your wolf must have been a lot larger ...   how big were the brookies on average in the lake ?"
701504,bicephalic,2012-05-31 13:57:00,112,I've been watching for this report since JB and I got back from Temagami.  Looks like the type of trip that dreams are made of..  Can't say I would have been as calm as you with a wolf following me down a trail like that  Thanks for sharing   PS 5:38 - #YeaBuddy!
701508,tb4me,2012-05-31 14:25:00,3295,Awesome Report Mike..Im now speechless..Thanks for that..
701509,Live2fish85,2012-05-31 14:26:00,1633,Mike that was a awesome video. The trip looks like it was a blast.  After seeing that I realize how much I miss doing trips into the back lakes. We will have to do a trip sometime.
701512,solopaddler,2012-05-31 14:32:00,8605,"Thanks all glad you enjoyed. I'm not likely going to make a habit of posting video reports, I much prefer writing, but it was kind of fun putting it together for a first attempt.  I'm leaving tonight for Nakina. We'll be flying into the Dusey River for brookies and to a lesser extent walleye and pike.  Should be a good trip report for this one, I'm pretty pumped about it.      The fish weren't big at all, anywhere from 14-17"" but incredibly abundant."
701514,I'mHooked,2012-05-31 14:43:00,525,Finally.  Great looking trip Mike. Looks like a soul cleansing type of experience. Nice to have the video memories. And you didn't have to carry any carcasses out of the bush!
701515,fishnsled,2012-05-31 14:49:00,3520,Now that was a great report! But we have come to expect those from you.  Quite the adventure getting in there and certainly felt the uneasiness of you being stalked. Cool video Mike! Thanks for taking the time to put it together.
701522,Musky or Specks,2012-05-31 15:00:00,2710,Wow nice trip. Even with an ATV it looks like a lot of work. I do love the idea of of the canoe rack on it. I can think of a lot of possibilities that it would open. Enjoy your trip on the Dusey
701531,johnnyb,2012-05-31 15:31:00,3413,"Very nicely done, Solo -- more proof that North = Better....place looks amazing.  I'm thinking you had to be continually grateful for the ATV as opposed to hiking in....video came out great, but definitely less buildup and descriptiveness than your writing provides.  I will have that rambling little tune stuck in my head all day now  Good luck on your next trip...sounds like a Doozie!!  I mean...Dusey"
701532,DanD,2012-05-31 15:33:00,2223,  Thanks.  Dan.
701555,adempsey,2012-05-31 16:43:00,1498,"Awesome report!   Would love to have such an adventure (well, minus being stalked by a bloodthirsty wolf!).  Looking forward to your Dusey River report.  Have a safe trip."
701572,Joey,2012-05-31 17:30:00,9122,"Really awesome video Mike.  Really enjoyed that!!!  Looks like it was a wonderful trip, with a few hairy ATV moments and the wolf follow.  Looks very tranquil and some nice fish"
701578,Roy,2012-05-31 17:56:00,13728,"Another stellar report Mike. Yours are always entertaining. Thank you.   Yeah I was thinking that too, Joey. For a closer look at the beast he should have run down the trail, stopped dead and done a figure eight."
701582,solopaddler,2012-05-31 18:10:00,8605, Good one!
701587,bdox,2012-05-31 18:31:00,329,"Hey Mike, is that an Elite-tech River Runner laying across the gunwales while Jason fights the fish? I'd like to hear your thoughts on the rod if you get a chance."
