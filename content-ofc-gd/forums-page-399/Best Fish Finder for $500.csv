703739,duxbware,2012-06-07 22:01:00,102,I know there are some good deals to be had in the for sale section. My question is....what is a good model? what is everyones experence? If he were to go new what is the best F.F with a gps for $500?

703796,ah_long,2012-06-08 01:37:00,354,"Humminbird 587 Ci HD Di  Lebaron has it for around $440  GPS, Sonar, Down Scan  have two of these on my boat"
703811,bigmac1984,2012-06-08 02:59:00,193,"If you can find a HDS5 Gen 1 new or used for the $500 mark, they are excellent units."
703816,hooked!,2012-06-08 03:18:00,38,I agree with ah_long - you have to check out the Humminbird 587ci HD with down imaging.  It's $445 at Lebaron - awesome price for a combo unit with so many features!
703855,Billy Bob,2012-06-08 12:02:00,5865,"If you don't mind a toy unit.......then get Hummerbird...  If you want a real tool to find fish then there is only LOWRANCE to choose from..........models from there are a personal choice.  Here's what Lake Erie perch look like trying to run but can't hide....   And here's what they look like after being caught.   NUFF SAID,  Bob"
703869,Raf,2012-06-08 13:22:00,3495,"you're a man, get a lowrance  leave the toys for the boys."
703976,mike rousseau,2012-06-08 19:35:00,4661,i love it... its like the blackberry slogan... we use tools not toys... referring to the iphone that can do everything a blackberry can do...   why are humminbirds are a toy???  user friendly? simple menu options? cheaper to have downscan?...only $100 with a HB... simple base mounts where you cant bend pins? have great portable pack options?   dont get me wrong... if the OP asked about units that are $1000 or more... sure...lowrance hds models for sure...those units are amazing... but at the price of $500... i truely believe HB has the better units... especially since you can get a sonar/gps unit with downscan for $500...
