703895,bow slayer,2012-06-08 14:51:00,1074,want to clean my snap down boat cover it is dirty and does have some mildew stains. Is there a product that is safer to use for this and after cleaning do you have to apply a spray to help it regain its water repellancy? On line i have found sites saying to use a mild soap and water and then maybe a diluted bleach solution for tough mildew stains. Some also suggest sraying the cover when cleaned with a vinegar/water solution to prevent mildew. Has anyone cleaned their cover? What worked for you? Any suggestions would be well welcomed....thanks again
