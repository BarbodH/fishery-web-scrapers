703570,bucktail,2012-06-07 13:37:00,1857,Thinking about heading to Maitland for perch on the weekend. I heard the perch were starting to show up but the big storm last week scattered them. Wondering if anyone has any up to date info for this week. Its the only time of year I keep fish usually and dont want to miss it. PM's welcome as well  Thanks  Darren
