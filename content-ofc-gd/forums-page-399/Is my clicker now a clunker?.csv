703890,johnnyb,2012-06-08 14:31:00,3413,"Hey guys...wondering if anyone can help me out here. I have a Walker 100LC reel that I use for downrigging -- cheap and basic reel but has held up really really well to lakers and a few salmon. On a recent outing, I had a spirited fish take a few nice runs, and I left the clicker engaged. Usually I only engage it when letting out line to avoid birdsnesting...then take it off once I'm running at my desired depth.  Anyway, after I brought in this fish, I went to set up again and the clicker switch was really loose, and would barely engage. Upon reeling in, the clicker is nice and loud, but when letting line out, it's barely catching, and I can actually see the switch getting pushed out of position.  Has this happened to anyone? I opened it up last night, but couldn't see any way in which to tighten that switch....any pointers would be welcome.    I've checked reelschematic.com and mikesreelrepair.com but neither of them list Walker for diagrams or parts. And the Walker website doesn't offer up anything useful...except new reels  "
703941,Steve,2012-06-08 17:29:00,2075,trust me. a new walker reel isn't useful!  you likely are out of luck.  I always suggest Okuma's to newbie's....as they are always replaced by Okuma when issues arrise.
703942,johnnyb,2012-06-08 17:32:00,3413,"Yep, I know it isn't a fancy reel, but, its done great for me for quite a while now, and the clicker seems to be a simple mechanism. Won't be heartbroken if I can't fix it....would just be nice to spend money on more lures/rigs than on a replacement reel"
704006,Sinker,2012-06-08 21:33:00,8692,"I have a pair of them as well. Both clickers were done within a season. They don't hold up well at all. I still use them here and there, but no clickers. The drags aren't too bad, you just gotta keep a thumb on the spool when setting up.  The Okuma reels are fairly cheap, and mine have lasted a few seasons now with no issues whatsoever.  S."
704025,Pigeontroller,2012-06-08 22:32:00,2793,"Pick up an Okuma Convector CV 20 or 30 depending on what size/line capacity you need...Solid reel, just under $100."
704026,johnnyb,2012-06-08 22:33:00,3413,I'm sensing a trend here.....LOL
704037,Steve,2012-06-08 23:10:00,2075,"johnny, you could have still bought the same tackle and goodies ... as the okuma magda is the same price, maybe less, and a better reel...  the convector is one step up from the magda.  okuma's are great reels for the money...no, they don't last forever, but okuma has one of the best replacement policies in fishing..."
704040,johnnyb,2012-06-08 23:16:00,3413,"I got the combo for $60 many years ago...I don't even remember seeing Okuma stuff back then. It will at least stick around as a linecounter reel for longlining, or a back up rigger rod. Since I will likely be getting a new reel, at least I can get a left-hander this time around.  If I could find a Daiwa Accudepth lefty, I'd choose it over the Okuma, but so far they are either super rare or non-existent."
