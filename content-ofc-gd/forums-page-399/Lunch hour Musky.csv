It sat about 7 feet from shore so I let out a foot of line and dragged the topraider by its nose a couple times, a shoreline figure 8 if you will, and sure enough it took it. Just a little guy but made for a great lunchtime activity. I know there is a bigger one around that same area, saw it on Tuesday, so I am hopeful I can find it at the end of my line one of these days!   "
