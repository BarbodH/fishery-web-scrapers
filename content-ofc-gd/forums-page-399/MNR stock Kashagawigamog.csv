701052,Toad Hunter,2012-05-30 00:54:00,261,"So I read in the Haliburton Echo, the MNR have stocked Kashagawigamog with 1500 Kingscote and Killala lakers !!  (here's the link - http://www.haliburtonecho.ca/ArticleDisplay.aspx?e=3570327 ) this is great, as if I wasn't anxious enough to get back up there on a regular basis with my ""new"" trailer, and ""new"" boat, but now, this just makes me giddy. Even more excited that they are ""mature"" and thus increasing their chances at survival and (fingers crossed) breeding ."
701189,Joey,2012-05-30 14:48:00,9122,Very cool
701191,johnnyb,2012-05-30 14:53:00,3413,"What we call ""mature"" the musky call ""dinner""...  "
701312,Toad Hunter,2012-05-30 21:25:00,261,"well then lets hope they don't get em all before ""the fall"" when they suggest they will be garlic butter worthy. The article said ""after consuming local vegetation"" - is this because the stocked fish are feed pellets ? (might be a silly question just curious) I plan on releasing most if not all I catch anyways, I'm about a 95% CPR kinda guy myself (catch, photo, release)"
703487,chris.brock,2012-06-07 01:44:00,4053,"that's kind of sad, Kash once had a natural, self sustaining lake trout population, if the MNR is stocking, that means they consider the original population toast"
703540,steverowbotham,2012-06-07 11:50:00,1800, I dont know about toast... 1500 is not a big number for the size of kash
703793,chris.brock,2012-06-08 01:29:00,4053,"no, 1500 isn't many for Kash, but I'm pretty sure the MNR stopped stocking fish in lakes with natural reproduction, the premise being that the stocked fish will interbreed with the natural fish making the population less fit"
703822,Toad Hunter,2012-06-08 03:36:00,261,well then here's hoping lol
703842,dave524,2012-06-08 07:02:00,4508,"Most of the stocking done in Haliburton is with local strains, strange they would do this.  http://hhoa.on.ca/hatchery/stocking"
703902,Nemo,2012-06-08 15:21:00,727,"If you are a resident or cottager you may want to read the LKO Lake report at  http://lko.on.ca/frameset/images/3/KLRFinal.pdf  The details are useful for fisherpeople.  The stocking history is outlined on page 21. They are not certain that the Lake Trout were native or introduced which surprised me.  Fish stocking history It is important to understand that stocking does not increase biodiversity or carrying capacity of a lake but may alleviate fishing pressure through supplementing supplies. Lake Trout (in the thousands) were stocked from 1942 to 1966, with the only recent stocking in 2009. Small mouth bass and yellow pickerel were stocked in the 1950s and 60s. Walleye were introduced from Lake Simcoe (previously absent from the lake) and stocked in the millions from 1952 to 1965. It is unclear if lake trout were present in the system before stocking; however both walleye and lake trout have become successful naturalized and prized species in the chain."
703948,adempsey,2012-06-08 18:02:00,1498," Nice report.  I was surprised there wasn't much discussion about the golf courses.  Wouldn't these be a large source of phosphorous runoff??  I don't really know, but I assume they use plenty of fertilizer and pesticides.   Anyway, that's another topic...  Anyway, it's nice to see the lake getting some love.  I only had the opportunity to fish there once during the winter - targeted walleye and caught herring and musky, go figure.  I always wanted to go back and try for some musky in the fall sometime."
