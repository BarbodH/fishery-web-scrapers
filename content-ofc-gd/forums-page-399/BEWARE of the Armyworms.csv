At the moment, they are walking fields 2-3 times a week checking for army worms.  Two seasons ago, right around this time, we were hit with a HUGE army worm infestation. I have a couple friends that operate big Self propelled sprayers and were running 24 hours a day/7 days a week trying to stay ahead of the worms. They are called army worms because they work just like an army advancing on an enemy. Once they have cleared out one field, they move on to the next in FLOCKS.  I was told a story once of an army worm outbreak out in the prairies. When they were moving from field to field across the road, cars were getting in accidents due to the slippery conditions. ( worms squished all over the road. )"

Being a little further north, we usually get a heads up if they are getting close. Glad we don't have to worry about them every year!"
