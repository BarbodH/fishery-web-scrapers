704041,nroadrunner,2012-06-08 23:18:00,113,"My young lad wanted to go fishing when I got home from work so we grabbed the rods and headed to the dam to see if we could stir up some perch or rock bass.  Anything to feed the craving until Bass opener LOL.  My second cast with a mepps landed this unexpected catch.  The picture is not great as I had to take it with my Blackberry.  My wife was with us and has a camera that can take photos with great detail but apparently she was busy taking other pictures    Its hard to tell but the photo is of a Speckle trout not anything spectacular, about 10 inches but great to see anyways.   Here is one of my son with a nice slab of a rock bass    Here are the other photos that my wife was taking when she was too busy to photograph my trout lol        2 seagulls were fighting on the other side of the dam and we couldn't figure out why until my wife zoomed in someone or thing had thrown a decent smallmouth up on the bank   Hope you enjoyed  Ian  "
