704369,misfish,2012-06-10 14:28:00,29133,"Nice going. I take it their just a bait fish,you don,t eat them do ya,s?"
704374,Broker,2012-06-10 14:46:00,482,"I haven't heard of anyone eating them, but I'm sure some people do"
704383,Rod Caster,2012-06-10 16:36:00,5784,They taste ok smoked. Didn't enjoy pan fried Goldeye
704385,misfish,2012-06-10 16:38:00,29133," Does look like a herring. I,m sure smoked would be ok."
704390,Broker,2012-06-10 17:09:00,482," hey, it's gotta taste better then catfish!"
704393,The JAY,2012-06-10 17:23:00,239,"Hey!   Congrats on the moonie! They definitely puch above their weight! I got a few the other night after you left. Same idea, nothing really until almost dark, then WHAM! I'll be back that way again this week sometime, so keep an eye. I'll bring more flies... Maybe time to invest in a smoker too..."
704398,misfish,2012-06-10 17:36:00,29133,"  Are you kidding me? Cat fish is awesome.  Jay,good on ya for helpping out a newbe to fly fishing."
704403,The JAY,2012-06-10 17:49:00,239,"Not at all, he had it pretty much down, just needed to tighten up his S's and put a nice dry on. The rest he had down pat. Good on 'em. Now wait until a smallie hits his fly, he'll be a confirmed addict."
704422,TJQ,2012-06-10 19:03:00,7806,There ya go!!
