703686,icefisherman,2012-06-07 20:01:00,952,"I need to repair some small tears in my boat's vinyl seats. Tears are about or less than an inch in length. Want to take care of them before getting to big. Has anyone attempted to do this and what would be the best and economical way to complete the job? Any kits one can buy? Thanks.  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"

703747,Ralph Field,2012-06-07 22:15:00,1018,Places selling liners for pools may have products for repairing small slits in vinyl. I would likely use electricians tape or duct tape or book binding tape.

703953,cityfisher,2012-06-08 18:19:00,959,I repaired by sled seat by getting some heavy duty thread and sowing the split. Then put on some heavy duty epoxy overtop.  Looked great 2 years later when i sold the sled.( it did take a long time)
