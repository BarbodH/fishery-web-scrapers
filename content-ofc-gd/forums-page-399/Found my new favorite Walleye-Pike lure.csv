703987,michigander fisherman,2012-06-08 20:41:00,64,So two years ago I was going through a fishing catalog and saw a lure called an Ugly Bug. Its a simple lure but super effective. I was nailing walleye and pike on it. It has been my go to lure on all my fishing trips for the past two years. Just wondering if any of you guys have ever heard or used one of these. It is made by the Gapen company.

To me, I would pop a hole or two or even three through the sides of a grub and feed some rubber strands through and it could work the same...  might have to give it a try this weekend with some grass trimmer line or something a bit softer to test it out."
