704179,SlowPoke,2012-06-09 14:42:00,2984, I saw that on another thread so I figured you were tied up. I can be out there super early if you want to hook up... maybe drag for some walleye from 5-6 and then slay the big girls!
704181,Handlebarz,2012-06-09 14:44:00,3790,I will see what they say when they get here. I thought if I told her I would be done by 10 she would say ok but we would stay till noon. I will call or text ya If it's a go
704183,SlowPoke,2012-06-09 15:02:00,2984,"This is why I'm never specific about time zones. Does it really need to be said ""we'll be done by 10:00AM Mountain"""
704197,Roy,2012-06-09 16:08:00,13728,"Great offer Brian....too far on short notice for me too. And yeah, the way to say it is ""Going for a loaf of bread Hon...back at 10 Pacific time."""
704202,Ralph Field,2012-06-09 16:28:00,1018,"A very generous offer, I would likely go if I wasn't confined to a wheelchair ( only for a few more months)."
704210,SlowPoke,2012-06-09 17:05:00,2984,"I won't hold that against ya I have lots of room in the boat for a chair. If you think we can get ya in and out, being on the boat won't be an issue at all."
704238,SlowPoke,2012-06-09 19:02:00,2984,Seat is taken
704240,Handlebarz,2012-06-09 19:13:00,3790,Oh sure be that way lol. I will LYK if we are makin it I need to get my boat out there is to much gas it's coming out the breather in thus heat today. Must fish to burn it off that's my reason. What time are ya going
704242,misfish,2012-06-09 19:17:00,29133,"I,ll take a seat,when your up on Simcoe.  Nice offering Brian."
704248,SlowPoke,2012-06-09 20:34:00,2984,You guys have fish there too?

704344,Ralph Field,2012-06-10 12:48:00,1018,Thanks for considering me but there is no possible way to get me into any type of boat at the present time.
704457,SlowPoke,2012-06-10 21:44:00,2984,PM sent. Sorry I missed the post but probably saved you several hours. The only thing biting was the flies.  This is starting to sound like a challenge! I hope the next few months fly by for ya.
