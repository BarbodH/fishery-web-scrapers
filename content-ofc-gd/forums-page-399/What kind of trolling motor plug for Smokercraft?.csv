703967,Roy,2012-06-08 19:19:00,13728,Better to change the boat's receptacle than the motor's plug.
703968,John,2012-06-08 19:21:00,2956,Yep match the receptacle to the Terrova plug
703973,BFSC Kevin,2012-06-08 19:28:00,1351,"Is it a new unit? If it is, then it doesn't come equipped with a plug out of the box..."
703977,sneak_e_pete,2012-06-08 19:39:00,540,New unit and boat comes with a receptacle which is why I want to match the plug to it (dealer is installing a unit I bought from a local store for free so want to provide all the right hardware).
