I fish all over Ontario with my wife and son, but our home area is SW Lake Huron tribs. and on the lake.  Please lend your knowledge help to ID this fish and end the debate.  Only had a phone cam. 100' depth, 5 mile off shore, SW Lake Huron, July.  Thanks in advance, and hope to share some more/better pics and reports on this cool site!"

703641,CRUD150,2012-06-07 17:44:00,87," We grow some nice Lakers down in the banana belt too.  Both were released.  On the king, we were catching nice 5-6lbs bows (keepers) on riggers in the same water. The salmon had a spawn hook and some line wrapped in it's gill plate, released it after some surgery. After seeing the pic and hearing the story, a fellow angler was insisting this was a steely. It's all good fun. "
