497153,nodie,2010-08-22 20:52:00,34,Called Marcum concerning a problem with a Marcum LX3. The battery wasnt lasting long enough and the digital display on the charger wasn't showing the full numbers. Not the end of the world but still wanted to have feedback on why this was happening. Gave them a quick call and I now have a new battery being sent as well as a new charger and display... Very impressed!  Good to have great customer service even when dealing with people from the USA! (shipping fees higher etc...)
