Caught 10 walleye on the Saturday in a little over 2 hours..I have never done so well.  Most fish taken trolling a worm harness on the weed edges early morning.  Fish ranged from 13-22 inches, and i kept a few that were not in the slot.  Surprisingly, I only caught 1 pike and a few bass.  The walleye curse has been lifted for me....finally."
