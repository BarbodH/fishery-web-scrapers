496810,newboykool,2010-08-21 19:15:00,81,"for those who don't know, i just started fly fishing a week ago  . So i'm really not in the process of tying my own flies, so i went to canadian tire yesterday then a local fly shop to pick up some flies, which ones are good to use and is the price decent? i bought the whole 12 pack for $5.99+tax and the other 2 for $4.06  Thanks =]   "
496821,Spiel,2010-08-21 20:16:00,9065,"Honestly, the flies in the first picture are poor copies of some of the older more popular flies. They may work but I'd recommend putting a little fly head cement on  the heads first, or at least a little clear nail polish as they have a tendency for the thread to unravel, quickly.  The 2 flies in the second picture will likely out fish all the previous ones time and time again."
496824,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-08-21 20:20:00,0,I have alot of flies. Most of which I hardly used by I can testify that the ones in the second picture have caught me alot of fish. My favourite being the wholly bugger and the stone fly(or nymph?).
496864,newboykool,2010-08-21 22:30:00,81,so a bit of nail polish  on the tip of the fly will help? thanks =]
