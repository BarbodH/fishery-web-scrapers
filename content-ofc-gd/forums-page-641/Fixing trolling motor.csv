497038,commie,2010-08-22 14:53:00,29,Last month I bought a Minn-Kota traxxis55 troller from Lebaron's. Took it out a few times...the last time out...the motor started smoking up...I turned it off.... But now the motor won't start again... Do I take it back toLebaron to fix or is there a minn-Kota dealer? I am assuming it's still covered by warranty?..
497044,Muskieman,2010-08-22 15:01:00,2472,The motor started smoking up?  The motor is underwater when in use ...did it start smoking under the hood?  or the base where the unit attaches to the bow?  regardless bring it back... If you try to fix it yourself they might accuse you of tampering with it and void the warranty.  who knows they might just give ya a new one.  Randy
