494801,highdrifter,2010-08-16 02:14:00,2534,So that's what you've been up to?!  Must have been a hoot on the 4wt.  I gotta say that's the prettiest carp I've ever seen!  Let's see you do that again.  HD
494841,Guest Rapala Boy,2010-08-16 06:22:00,0,"Since your into fly fishing I'll save you some hard work and let you know if your gonna be fishing for trout in small stocked ponds go with really small bead head nymphs. Sizes 14-16, smaller in clear water and a long leader with a large bright corky at the top as a float. Use a very very slow retrieve once the fly sinks a good amount, and I mean real slow like with just twisting your hand. If your fishing super pressured waters tip it with a small piece of trout worm and do the same thing. I learned all this fishing Trout Farms and working my way to heavily fished ponds at Glen Haffy CA.  By the way I never use my 5wt, only 8wt cause it has more power for longer roll casts. PEACEOUT!"
494901,SudburyAngler,2010-08-16 14:30:00,154,"That tip is gonna help me, thanks"
494913,frozen-fire,2010-08-16 14:48:00,542,"Nice! I also caught my first fish on my 5wt 2 days ago. Then I proceeded to catch 20 more small bass! Need to move on to bigger fish like yourself! However, my casting still sucks as I've only been out with it once so far. Keep us updated on your progress. I can't wait to fight a steelhead on my 8wt"
495154,cuzza,2010-08-16 21:43:00,467," If you're going to use a massive indicator and tip your flies you might as well cast a float and worm rig out.  8wt with a 16 hook? Talk about unbalanced! Tommy, you might want to take this *advice* with a good helping of salt  ETA - good effort on the carp laszlo!"
495158,Guest Rapala Boy,2010-08-16 21:47:00,0,"Dude, it was enough to out fish almost everyone at the pond. It must be the hand twisting retrieve that does the trick."
495160,alexcba,2010-08-16 21:50:00,634,decided to send a pm
495162,Guest Rapala Boy,2010-08-16 21:54:00,0,"no, but I think I know who your talking about.....from april/may?"
495266,ehg,2010-08-17 02:19:00,2666,That carp probably put up a great fight on a 4wt. WTG!
497001,laszlo,2010-08-22 13:22:00,487,"Hit the river yesterday evening for a bit with my buddy Dan. The Carp were out to play once again taking any fly we put in front of their faces.  Dan with 1 of 5 he caught.     Now, moving on to some trout..."
479358,laszlo,2010-06-25 11:36:00,487,Picking up my first fly rod / reel Sunday. Don't have to be into work on Monday until 2pm. Hmmm...what to do Monday morning???
480295,laszlo,2010-06-28 11:06:00,487,The water is high but I can't resist putting my new set up into use. Hitting the river to practise casting but the chance of catching a fish is very low.  Here we go...
480313,JohnF,2010-06-28 13:01:00,3494," We need facts, son. What line are you using? Dry? Wet? What patterns? How do you expect the rest of us to learn from your mistakes unless you give us details?  Seriously. I'm ready to hit the creek with my own flyrod now. After the way the bass gobbled up a bubblegum worm laying still on the bottom and a crankbait at the moment it hit the surface I'm not sure what to start with. I'd love to go dry and get to see the explosion. Guess I'll just wing it and see what's what. I was looking at the local bug life to see what might work topwater but none of them ressembled the crankbait that I caught the one smb on.  Mebbe if all us flynoobs compare notes we can come up with our own rules for flyfishing. I mean whoda thunk 20 years ago that pink plastic worms would be a goto bass bait? So who says we really gotta match the hatch today. With all the ersatz critters we're using successfully with our redneck rods and reels why can't we use something equally imaginative for fly patterns instead of going for realism? I think I need one more trip to the creek and a few more decent smb's on the hook with the redneck gear and then I'll settle down to the flyrod. I've still got the flies that SingingDog sent me. They'll be my first round of experimentation.  Anyway, if you have some success - sorry, WHEN you have success take some pics of the patterns cuz names mean nada to me. It's all just feathers 'n yarn as far as I'm concerned. Wooly bugger was the great hairy bully in public school, not a fly.  I've got my spot picked out. The place I was in yesterday and caught the pair of 18 inchers. It's a perfect spot (I think). I can stand on the shallow side of the river and drop the dry fly over by the other bank in a light current and about 3' of water. Let it drift downstream under the shade of the trees and bushes. Lotsa back casting space behind me. I'm looking forward to it.  JF"
480465,laszlo,2010-06-28 20:19:00,487,"Went with the Temple Forks 8' 6""  4wt 2pc Rod - Signature Series  Temple Forks Prism 3/4 Reel.  Floating Line  A variety of flies, leaders and tippet.  Will report back when the rivers clear up a bit..."
480552,Musky or Specks,2010-06-28 23:26:00,2710,Lazlo bluegills and sunfish from a pond are a great way to practice dont rely on just river fishing
480554,BillsTheBassMan,2010-06-28 23:33:00,932, Knowing a buddy with a stocked smallmouth pond helps as well
480561,laszlo,2010-06-28 23:49:00,487,The Set Up  
480569,highdrifter,2010-06-29 00:10:00,2534, That's a no-brainer eh?!?!
480574,JohnF,2010-06-29 00:43:00,3494,"I got a 5 weight 9' 3 pc with a small arbor reel loaded with #5 floating line. Sorry, no cams at home tonight.  I don't have a second spool yet. If I get into thia I'll probably go with a better setup with extra spools for different lines rather than spend more money on spools for a basic reel.  Sounds like the weather is good for the weekend so I'll be out waving it around a bit. I've got the flies ready, I think. Looking forward to it. The rod doesn't seem too bad for casting. Now we'll find out if I can measure up. I might have to strap my forearm to the rod.  JF"
480606,BillM,2010-06-29 01:52:00,17367,"For the new guys (like I once was) best way to get your confidence up is to fish in the evenings..  Should still be able to get into some pretty good hatches..  Go to your fav local trout stream, match the hatch and have fun."
480613,JohnF,2010-06-29 01:59:00,3494, Got no trout around here. It's either bass or carp.  JF
480617,BillM,2010-06-29 02:05:00,17367,"John, shouldn't have a problem nailing any kind of panfish if there are a tonne of bugs around either.  I actually nailed a whitefish on a dryfly on my recent fly-in trip!!  I'm sure all you guys will love the report once Mike posts it up."
480625,JohnF,2010-06-29 02:12:00,3494, I'll settle for a feisty rock bass.  JF
488317,laszlo,2010-07-25 23:32:00,487,Haven't fished for three weeks now but will be searching for Browns and Bows Monday very early morning for a few hours before work.  That's all for now... Will report back.
488322,BillM,2010-07-25 23:57:00,17367,"Keep an eye on the river temps dude, anything more then 70 and I'd reconsider fishing...."
488325,laszlo,2010-07-26 00:06:00,487, Does the night temps going down to 16 help this any or is it just too hot during the day right now for that to have enough of an impact?
488359,BillM,2010-07-26 01:36:00,17367,"I think with these brutally hot days, the temp dropping a bit for a few hours at night isn't going to make a big impact on the river temps..   Bring a thermometer with you..  The last thing you wanna be doing is killing off a bunch of steelhead smolts or brookies"
488439,laszlo,2010-07-26 12:36:00,487,Alarm went of at 4:15am. Sleeping just felt too good. Stayed in bed.  21 days and counting since the last time I fished.
488441,BillM,2010-07-26 12:42:00,17367,LOL!!!!!   I've done that a few times
494503,laszlo,2010-08-14 23:30:00,487,Had a couple hours to kill after work so I hit the river behind my place to practise my casting.  Did pretty well considering the river is as nasty as it is.  3 Chub 4 Sunfish 4 Rockbass  I approached this one stretch to find 5 or 6 carp chillin' just below the surface. First cast lands right in front of ones face and...BAM...FISH ON!  Was about 6 pounds and it put the 4wt to it's limits.  I wasn't even expecting to catch anything. Hilarious!
494510,bare foot wader,2010-08-14 23:43:00,1354,carp on a fly rod is tough game...and on a 4wt bet that was a good fight too
494591,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-08-15 11:42:00,0,Sounds great but we need some pictures and preferably some video of some fly fishing!
494593,laszlo,2010-08-15 11:56:00,487, Camera was missing in action. I was only expecting to get into a couple chub.
494724,laszlo,2010-08-15 20:41:00,487,Carp fishing has never really been my thing but sight fishing for them on a fly rod is pretty wicked and somewhat restores my faith in the river behind my place that I previously deemed useless.   This guy observed my lacking fly skills for a bit.     The Approach...     The Pay Off...     
494726,SudburyAngler,2010-08-15 20:46:00,154,"I'm just starting to, Tight lines."
476525,laszlo,2010-06-16 21:00:00,487,Some of you may remember last fall when I started the topic 'The Progression of a Steelhead Newbie'. A lot was learned and many of you gave great advice.  That eventually got me into float fishing with a centerpin and float rod. I would say last fall was the best fishing I've done in many years!  Next week I'll be buying my first fly rod/reel and will be documenting it all here in this topic up to my first fish on the fly.  Can't wait! Stay tuned...
476529,Roy,2010-06-16 21:04:00,13728,"Sounds like a good series to follow, Lazlo. Great initiative."
476546,Twocoda,2010-06-16 21:44:00,4130,Go get em Laz....  As is everything with fishing when you change presentations ...you have to spend money to save money... pick up an entry level fly tying kit to appreciate the entire capture of your species...there is nothing better then landing a fish on a fly you created from a few materials and a hook  You should start a poll on this thread for fun to see who thinks youll land your first on the fly rod  Good Luck
476550,MJL,2010-06-16 21:49:00,2427,Say it aint so Laz  Getting into fly fishing is almost like getting into float fishing but it’s much worse…  Why? - 1 fly rod doesn’t do it all…You’ll NEED fly rods in all different lengths and actions  - You’ll never look at a rabbit at the pet shop the same way again…No need to mention road kill  - You’ll shove various fly magazines underneath your mattress (maybe that was just me)  - You’ll pretend your lawn is a trout stream and your neighbours (along with the mail man) will think you’re weird   Looking forward to seeing the journey
476575,JohnF,2010-06-16 22:34:00,3494,"I'm looking forward to this. I've been trying to get myself started for a couple of years but I always seem to end up leaving the fly gear in the car cuz it's too windy or something. Truth is it's just easier to go with what I know and chase the bass with a spinning rod.  Mebbe I'll feel more like I've got company on the river this way.  So, are you starting wet or dry?  JF"
476594,laszlo,2010-06-16 23:13:00,487, Starting Wet. I have had some luck with wet fly's before matched with a float.  That set up was a little make shift thought :/
476598,Duckie,2010-06-16 23:35:00,305,"good stuff. I took a fly tying course with Grindstone Angling in Waterdown when I started fly fishing 10 years ago.  tying flies is surprisingly easy - you can tie any fly in the world using the same 4 basic steps (whip finish, pinch technique etc) that a good fly instructor will teach you. the course I took was two nights. it was well done. the amazing flies you see are done by creative and talented people..but the basic steps they use to make the fly are the same.  the best advice to give on fly casting is to practice practice and more practice.  I do a lot of trout fishing, so I use a 5 weight rod and reel.  for a more all purpose rod I would go with a 6 weight. you can cast poppers for bass a bit easier with a rod like this.  Also, although a fly outfit can be expensive, try not to go too cheap. a better rod will make learing to cast easier and help with casting with wind present, which there always is LOL."
476605,Twocoda,2010-06-17 00:07:00,4130," EVERY cast is practice unless its one resulting to a fish  ....then it was just an ""experience"" cast"
476610,streamerstripper,2010-06-17 00:11:00,28,"If you can find it your best bet would be to buy a used (but quality) rod and reel off someone rather than spend the same $$ to buy a crappy new setup.  Put a quality new line on an older setup and you are in business...have fun and don't abandon your fishy instincts!  Alot of guys think that flyfishing is a different universe than other fishing, its not - if you know where fish like to be its 1/2 the battle..."
476653,laszlo,2010-06-17 01:31:00,487,"Temple Forks Outfitter 4wt 8' 6"" rod ordered and should be in hand in about a week. (thanks dave) Now on to the reel."
476683,BillsTheBassMan,2010-06-17 02:49:00,932,"I just started this year myself and got a great all purpose setup that I am very happy with.  Don't cheap out on your line!  Get Rio line and leaders (the 3 packs of leaders are amazing) and they have the pre-looped ends which make attaching them really easy (particularly mid-river).  My friend Timmeh says the Scientific Angler stuff is alright as well, but he uses the rio leaders too.  As I'm a fly-newb as well (I've reached the ""river practice"" phase), I look forward to reading this!  Ryan"
476691,timmeh,2010-06-17 03:35:00,609,"Some words of wisdom I was given when starting out recently:  -You don't need to spend too much money on the reel, it's not as important as a spinning reel is, to your overall setup. -Spend money on your line, it's the only thing thing that connects you to your fly plus a good line will make casting much easier. -Check out reelflies.ca for most of your flies. But spend some time in the local stores and buy a few flies from them. They will be great sources of info in the future. -Make sure you get a casting lesson from a GOOD source, so you can avoid picking up bad form early. -Practice casting, it will pay off. I probably looked kinda crazy casting at snow drifts this winter but I know it has made a difference.  One thing I would strongly recommend is a guide when you first go out, if you can afford it. And go one on one so you get the full attention. This was the first thing I did, and although I didn't actually catch any fish on that trip, it was well worth it. The casting advice alone was great. It's made a huge difference in me being able to catch the fish I have rather than piercing my ears. Many guides offer learn to fish programs that are entirely on the water and a little less expensive than regular trips.  Also fly fishing will probably make you a better fisherman overall, as you will need to slow things down a little, and be much more observant, in order to be successful. You'll learn to read the water better and that will also help with your steelie trips in the fall.  Good luck..."
476779,torco,2010-06-17 14:58:00,656,"Another newbie here as well.  Practice is key with casting. I don't practice enough and am still a terrible caster, that said you don't have to be a great caster to get fish but it helps  A good piece of advice I received was when starting out only cast as far as is comfortable. For example if you can only cast 20 feet well, position yourself to make a good 20 foot cast at the fish rather than trying to put a bad 30 foot cast out there."
