But for now, any explanation for why the eastern tribs get the early runs?"

So the fish arrive at the Eastern tribs first. They also start running them earlier as the water temps of those rivers is some what cooler than the tribs closer to TO/Mississauga/Oakville.

496987,Spiel,2010-08-22 12:43:00,9065,  I'd say smallie given the location of the pectoral and pelvic fins.
