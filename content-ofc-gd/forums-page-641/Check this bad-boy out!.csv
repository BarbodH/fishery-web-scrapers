497124,CLofchik,2010-08-22 19:27:00,854,  Thanks for validating my point If you want a budget Shimano just buy a Pinnacle off Ebay for 1/2 price.
497126,Spiel,2010-08-22 19:33:00,9065, So you're trashing them not because they're graphite bodies but because they're Shimanos?     
497132,CLofchik,2010-08-22 19:49:00,854," I wouldn't trust either.  Then again I'm not paid to pretend these things are the next best thing to sliced bread either. If you want a baitcaster under $100, Abu C3.  Period."
497134,Spiel,2010-08-22 19:56:00,9065,  I'll refer you back to my first comment.  
497139,CLofchik,2010-08-22 20:05:00,854, I suppose in the cold weather the fish will be sluggish enough you can get away with it
497140,kickingfrog,2010-08-22 20:06:00,8333,"It doesn't even have to be winter to appreciate a non-metal reel for cold/wet hands. Sure its's a compromise but I'd rather have my bare hands on a ""plastic"" reel then a mitt on a metal one when it's cold and wet."
497141,kickingfrog,2010-08-22 20:07:00,8333,  Or you could just use skill... oh sorry ... never mind.
497143,HTHM,2010-08-22 20:22:00,4082,I have a measuring tape if you'all need to settle this pissing contest.....

497148,aplumma,2010-08-22 20:39:00,6896,do we need to add Clofchik name to the troll list???? or is this temporary.   Art
497152,ontariofisherman,2010-08-22 20:51:00,52,"  So are you trying to tell me you can help me get a lefty, the guy at bps couldn't tell me when they would have them."
497165,kickingfrog,2010-08-22 21:41:00,8333, Not at all. Just a difference of opinion and how to express them.
497353,MJL,2010-08-23 15:17:00,2427,The big question I have isâ€¦Will it handle a 55+ inch muskie that's going to be at the end of my line next week?
497357,BillM,2010-08-23 15:29:00,17367," Mike, I'd love to see a pic of that if you hook into one of those monsters!"
497365,The Urban Fisherman,2010-08-23 15:39:00,2050," Neither am I!   Everybody is entitled to their opinion so no hard feelings amongst fellow OFNer's guys!  I myself love the reel and have no complaints about it thus far!  I have a couple of $300+ reels that were given to me as a gift and both the caenan's and citica's have a home in my boat right beside them.  I've been a shimano baitcaster fan for many years but have never once knocked another brand publicly.  The main reason I don't post many video's here on OFC is because I'm most likely going to get jumped on for being a spammer by somebody... despite the fact that I've been a contributing member of the board for years, and simply enjoy sharing some of my work.  Cheers, Ryan"
497387,bdox,2010-08-23 16:31:00,329," It doesn't bother me, but I can see where people are coming from. You're posting Shimano marketing material and you just happen to work for Daver Mercer who is sponsored by Shimano. Again, I don't care. You won't find a rod or reel in my quiver that's not a Shimano/Loomis product. Maybe a disclaimer would help?"
496474,The Urban Fisherman,2010-08-20 15:44:00,2050,"Hey Gang!  I just spent the week on the road with Dave shooting some new show's, and I've been waiting for the ""ok"" to post this video.  Being young and having kids and a wife who's still finishing her University Degree via the web makes my fishing budget a little tighter than some.  That being said I can't really afford reels like curado's or chronarch's so I was pretty stoked to be able to get my hands on the prototype of this reel a few months back!!!    This job of mine has to have some perks right! hehe  It's a bad-ass reel, and I had to shoot some stuff for this promo but let's be honest... there's no way I wasn't going to take it out for a test run..... or two...  Price tag...... Drum roll please... UNDER A HUNDRED BUCKS!  I was telling MJL about it last time we talked so if you see this post, here it is buddy.  I hope you like the video we put together for it!  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOXEcKGODAE  Cheers, Ryan"
496475,alexcba,2010-08-20 15:48:00,634,hmmm i think a trip to bass pro is in order.
496478,The Urban Fisherman,2010-08-20 15:51:00,2050,"Give it a look Alex!  And yeah if you're wondering hte audio is out sync... You Tube has been bad for that lately....  Cheers, Ryan"
496531,frozen-fire,2010-08-20 17:28:00,542,Wow...under $100? Must check it out!
496532,tb4me,2010-08-20 17:34:00,3295,Awesome! yes the audio was out for me too.
496536,SRT8 smoker craft,2010-08-20 17:37:00,1107,they do look sweet and if you pair it with a clarus rod you would have a top notch bass stick for around $200 I think thats awesome pretty sure there will be a couple of these combo's in my arsenal come the off season .
496545,thefireman,2010-08-20 17:46:00,51,"Nice reel for sure, will have to take a look!"
496570,bdox,2010-08-20 18:47:00,329,"Hey Ryan, can you confirm that it's going to be less than $100 CAD? I'm pretty sure that $89 is USD. Shimano always up the price by 30-$50 when it comes north of the border."
496572,danbouck,2010-08-20 18:50:00,4380,  Can I try it in 2 weeks
496577,The Urban Fisherman,2010-08-20 19:17:00,2050,Bdox... I'll find out when I can and get back to you!
496893,ontariofisherman,2010-08-22 00:38:00,52,I was at bps today and it's right around $100. only have them in right hand no lefts.
496972,The Urban Fisherman,2010-08-22 12:01:00,2050,Cool - thanks Fishermanjohn!
496988,daryl0815,2010-08-22 12:47:00,225,"That looks pretty nice, and I was debating a new baitcaster too, I have a big Calcutta, but it is a little too big to be comfortable fishing all day. I think I might have to take a look at this, I have always been a huge shimano fan, and under 100$ who could pass it up?."
497024,ontariofisherman,2010-08-22 14:09:00,52,"this is a good looking real and for me this is a really good buy, just have to wait till they come out with a lefty."
497048,Dave Mercer,2010-08-22 15:05:00,148,They are made in both right hand and left.
497053,MSBruno,2010-08-22 15:24:00,369,I wonder how this stacks up to the citica
497066,Duckie,2010-08-22 16:24:00,305," based on the specs, it doesn't look like it makes much sense to go with the Caenan over the Citica.  you are much better off spending the extra bit of cash and get the citica intead.  for a bit more you get:  -high efficiency gearing -super free spool system (its going to cast a lot better) -better anti reverse (has 'assist stopper') -and an aluminum frame. not graphite.  I know its a budget reel, but when you are already spending $100 for this one, it probably is worth the next jump up IMO."
497084,johnnyb,2010-08-22 17:30:00,3413,"HMMMM.....looks interesting....too bad about no lefties.  Picked up a Cruxis in a leftie for the wife and I've tried it a time or two....very nice.  I kind of wonder if they pump these reels out just to protect the price point of their premier reels.  My Crestfire, which ran me $55 USD AND came with a rod, lasted me 13 years without so much as a tune-up or cleaning before the gear finally broke inside....probably a $25-$30 fix at Aikman's if I still want it as a back-up or icefishing cranker. My Corsair 301 was a little more than $100....maybe $160 when I bought it, but it also went a solid 10 years until needing any attention. Now I know that a Curado, or Core, or Calcutta is going to be a smoother, longer casting reel....but are they really worth the money?  My wife's Cruxis is ridiculously smooth, and I haven't even taken all the brakes off yet (so I've tried it out more than a couple times  )...but I really wonder if I NEED to plunk down much more than $100 when I finally replace my worn out Crestfire...?????   Food for thought."
497089,Duckie,2010-08-22 17:55:00,305," when you look at the performance over the life of the reel, I think so.  I have a Chronach 100A that I bought in 1998 that was almost $300 at the time.  12 years later, not only is it still working fine, it is still smoother than most of today's more modern reels.  so in that sense, yes I think in some cases it can be.  now, if this reel breaks, I know you can't get parts for it anymore. thats the only thing.,  shimano builds reels to last over a decade but only makes compatible parts available for a few years. sucks if you ask me.  "
497093,shimano25,2010-08-22 18:01:00,31,Too bad I don't know how to use a baitcaster.
497108,Spiel,2010-08-22 18:53:00,9065,"Looks like a winner for my ice fishing set ups. I like graphite bodies over aluminium in the cold months, much more comfortable on the hands."
497112,CLofchik,2010-08-22 19:06:00,854,"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anwy2MPT5RE  I'm not sure how small the fish are y'all are catching, but judging by the pile of junk in my basement graphite framed budget Shimano's last exactly 1.5 hooksets, with Shimano reels either go big or go elsewhere.  They do have an impressive marketing budget though"
497117,Spiel,2010-08-22 19:19:00,9065,"  Well what do I know. Okay I know my Daiwa graphite body bait casters (15 or so years old) have landed me Georgian Bay Kings, Whities, Steel, Lakers and Browns as well as Simcoe Lakers and Whities, both on ice and open water.  But I'll cede to your infinite wisdom on all things fishing related."

497122,HTHM,2010-08-22 19:26:00,4082,"Well, there is a turn I did not expect..... Looks like a neat reel, but I was taught that if it is cheap, it's CRRRRaaaaap. I would love to be wrong."
