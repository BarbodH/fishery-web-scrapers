It's a secret but look for it, were gonna catch some biggins   Lol I'm 6ft and big bone  I caught lot's of fish that were in the 3lb class. The lake record said by the locals was only 6lbs believe it or not. I guess it doesn't get fished very much in October by anybody. Might be worth it to fish again in the fall, I had 2 bass that were very long and skinny, if feeding would of been a easy 6 and possibly a 7 in the fall.  22"" and a 23.5""   It's just a normal Kodak camera I am pretty sure. I don't think the lense comes off but I could be wrong. It's a Kodak Easy Share Z7121S....On the lense it says Variogon 36mm-432mm with a 12x Zoom.   Nope, back in Oshawa   All of the bass caught on jigs were fat. Only 2 or 3 were fat and caught on frogs but most were skinny. Skinny fish related to flats with thick weeds, fat fish were on rock walls with weeds and wood."

Well for the past summer I worked full time for 2 months then after that in July I made my way out to visit some family and get some summer project work done for Fleming College, I have been out in the Township of Leeds and the Thousand Islands. If you know the area you know its beautiful territory for bass and a destination to spend the summer. As always I had my camera on every trip out in the boat. It was a awesome summer and I learned lot’s more about bass fishing and the joy of the sport.Here are a collection of photo’s and memories from my trips this past summer. I caught lot’s of fish at the start but finding bigger fatter bass for me in most locations consisted of rock, weeds and deep water. I picked up a bunch of healthy 3lb+ fish on jigs and snag proof frogs in weeds or on edges close to water up to 20ft deep. It’s cool how some of the drops on this lake and the joining canal can produce such awesome looking structure.Now being said I caught fish on the big heavy bait cast stick but I also took time to fish finesse baits in deeper water and also a little pike fishing here and thereHere are a couple nice photographs of stuff.Well on to the fun stuff, first off I have a few fish from a body of water and a few more pictures I want to share before I get onto the many, many bass pics.Basically here are some pictures of a lake never photographed or hardly fished except by a local here and there. The lake is not easy to get into. First you need to cross the main lake, then make your way paddling through a creek like swamp…maybe 8”deep at the most, lol. Over the dozen or so logs and 15minutes later I come up to a beaver dam, once the 12ft boat, motor and all are over we are in awe…just looking at this small lake was awesome. It’s called Mud Lake and the average depth is 2ft deep with a mud bottom. As a experiment I dropped my anchor into it with 20ft of rope and it never reached bottom.Being a unpreserved fishery fish were aggressive and always hitting lures, it was fun. Here are a few pictures from the trip in and a few of the fish we caught in the pond.And last here are a bunch of pictures of some better than average bass. Most fish are close to 3 or bigger.Here we go!The 5lb 8ozWell that’s it, all said and done.Anyway, it was a great time for bass fishing, hope to post up a few more “day trip” reports bass fishing this fall.Thanks for reading and/or skimming through the pictures,MTBFRods:7’H Action St Croix Legend Tournament Bass (Casting)6’9” ML Action St Croix Avid Series (Spinning)7’2” MH Rapala R-Type(CastingReels:Shimano Curado 200E7Shimano Symetre 3000Rapala R-Type BaitcasterBaits Used:SenkosBooyah Pigskin JigsStrike King Premier JigsTerminator SpinnerbaitsSnag Proof FrogsHusky JerksFin Tech Shakey Jigs w Berkley Chigger CrawsAnd one of my favorites, a picture I shot after a rainfall 2 hours ago"

I know of one that is 4ft at the deepest and I never see anyone on it.... the ""locals"" who stopped when i was scoping it from my van tell me there is no fish in it.... hmmmmmm   Great report bro   Looking forward to your report from the trip you won last spring too"
496325,Garry2Rs,2010-08-20 02:45:00,1425,Great stuff Mike. I hope you have a good Fall season too! Garry2R's
496328,EC1,2010-08-20 02:52:00,930,"Now that is some awesome fishing and scenery. I've went around to a few of those kingston area lakes, and the fish seem much more willing to bite than at the kawarthas!  I'm surprised I don't see lines from the trails of your frogs on those pictures with all the slop! You still over in the Kingston area?"
496330,Cudz,2010-08-20 02:58:00,2652,nice job Mike.  Nice loon pics.  Guess that is why they call you Mike the Bass Fisher.  I even like the fact that I saw a few smalljaws on there.  Funny how some of those bass are fat and some are real thin.  Keep up the good work.  That bowfin is sick too.  That must have been a scrap.
496383,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-08-20 11:52:00,0,Mike. Are you sure your not 4 foot 11? You make those bass look huge! Some real pigs in that collection. Looks like you had a great summer of bass fishin!
