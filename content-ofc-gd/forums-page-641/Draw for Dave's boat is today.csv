490321,GBW,2010-08-01 17:07:00,8460,you mean I have to wait a few more weeks now?
490710,Nipfisher,2010-08-03 01:02:00,2449,"Cool Dave, Glad to see you are logging in and checking threads. I guess they draw your attention when your name is in the title. Cheers."
496840,Dutch,2010-08-21 21:44:00,831,"Well, in case you haven't heard the winner of Dave's boat will be announced Friday, August 27.  I for one have never seen a contest set up like this one before.  The winner, along with the secondary draw winners, were apparently drawn on July 30, 2010 at 2:00.  It would have been nice to know the winner would be ANNOUNCED nearly a month later.  For whatever reason, probably becuase the boat is required for more filming, which I suport 100%, there is a month wait to find out.  All it would have taken was a sentence in the rules that said ""Draw on July 30, winner announced August 27.""  Instead the rules read ""The 48 remaining secondary prizes, will be drawn and distributed with the Grand Prize at the Cundari Office, approximately 2pm on July 30th 2010.""  The words ""drawn and distributed"" tend to mean to me that the prize winners would be announced and packages sent out or winners contacted to pick them up.  To me, this is frustrating.  I did go to Subway more often to get my name in the draw as much as possible and I feel misled.  I'll rethink my action next year if there is a contest.  The communication regarding the draw time and prizes could have been a lot better.  Instead, all I have seen are comments that the delay is due to the lawyers....they are the easy ones to blame.  Anyway, looking forward to FINALLY hearing who the winner is of the main and secondary prizes, but the announcement that the date was going to be this Friday should have been made shortly after the draw - not nearly 3 weeks later on August 21.  Hopefully Subway will do a better job next year....."
496862,Who Da Man,2010-08-21 22:23:00,21,Someone should as Dave if his GPS comes loaded with all his secret spots!
496884,ctdd2006,2010-08-22 00:09:00,531,It was a FREE draw right???...I'm sure lawyers were involved and nobody tried misleading anyone!  Good on Subway and Dave!
496891,Dave Mercer,2010-08-22 00:30:00,148,"Dutch, First of all thanks for supporting Hook, Line & Subway and thank you for your feedback. However I have to be honest and tell you I think your way off base here. This is a very large contest with a very large prize for someone. With such a contest there is a lot of legal red tape that has to be taken care of and this takes time. The prize was not delayed due to me having to use the boat or anything like that as you had suggested. In Canada we have some crazy laws and the bigger the prize the more laws there is to deal with. I hope you feel better after trashing a contest where a major non-fishing company is giving a major fishing related prize away and promoting our sport in the process.  Now that I have said what I feel good luck in the contest! I hope if you win you can see past the fact that you had to wait 30 whole days to find out."

489941,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-07-30 17:19:00,0, I don't think you ate more subway subs than me.
489943,BIG FISH,2010-07-30 17:20:00,54,"im in where do they announce the winner, is it a live thing we can watch or just gotta wait for a phone call type of thing?"
489945,EC1,2010-07-30 17:27:00,930,Good luck all! They should have made this an OFC exclusive contest
489947,Spiel,2010-07-30 17:36:00,9065,"I'm in at least a dozen times not that it matters, I never win anything."

489959,Roy,2010-07-30 17:51:00,13728,"I wish I could have entered. But, in Quebec it's the government that runs all draws and lotteries. But then they also run alcohol, gambling and prostitution.  Good luck to all my OFC Buds."
489960,mbac31,2010-07-30 17:53:00,904,Three of my most favorite things Roy. Lol. I'm in as well.
489965,TC1OZ,2010-07-30 18:08:00,987,I'm just waiting for my confirmation!
489969,Mike Pike,2010-07-30 18:19:00,1332,"I never entered because I never order one of those 'Fresh Value Meals' to qualify, althought I DO go to Subway so often I probably spent enough to BUY Dave's boat!!!  Goodluck to all!"
489973,keiths,2010-07-30 18:24:00,30,"Just to be on the safe side, I better cancel the plans for buying a new boat. I won't need two of them, lol."
489977,ColdH20guy,2010-07-30 18:44:00,312,anyone's phone ringing yet? lol  I keep staring at mine but nothing so far.......
489982,TC1OZ,2010-07-30 18:58:00,987,I believe the draw is at exactly 3:00 PM... I read the fine print the other day. And you have 24 hours to respond to the phone call... maybe 48... I'm waiting lol
489986,ColdH20guy,2010-07-30 19:09:00,312,"The selected entrant for the Grand Prize will be chosen by a random draw at the Cundari office at approximately 2pm on July 30th 2010 2010. The selected entrant will be contacted by telephone by a representative of the Contest Sponsors, and must reply within 24 hours to maintain eligibility.  Odds of winning are dependent on number of entries received.   phone must be off the hook! lol"
489988,TC1OZ,2010-07-30 19:20:00,987,"  Hahaha, I don't have much faith in the Subay in welland. I have a feeling my ballots were lost!"
489993,canuckjack,2010-07-30 19:23:00,121,"That's weird, my phone has rung yet, and I was so sure about this one ...  Oh well there's always the Lotto Max tonight."
490045,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-07-30 22:52:00,0,There's no mention of anything on his web site!
490055,Dutch,2010-07-30 23:44:00,831,"OK - so I my heart in my throat about 1:45 this afternoon.  My wife answers the phone and says something along the lines of ""OH MY GOD - THAT's FANTASTIC.""  I was just getting out of the shower - I know bad visual and I almost slipped and fell on my ass.  I was just about ready to start jumping (probably another bad visual, ooops), when she says away from the phone - it's not the boat.  Aww, snap.  But we did win something today.  My wife won the WOLF (local radio station) July draw for their summer giveaways.  All totalled, a $10,000 prize package.  We are happy with that, so I won't be too upset if I don't get my name pulled for the boat, although I wouldn't turn it down....lol."
490058,TC1OZ,2010-07-30 23:53:00,987, Just ask for the cash value and get a boat!~ hehe  Congratulations on the win!
490135,Rob,2010-07-31 18:04:00,467,So who won the boat?  WE
490163,Dave Mercer,2010-08-01 00:02:00,148,"Hey All, You will have to wait a few more weeks the draw has taken place but due to all the legal stuff they have to do it will be two weeks before they let the winner know. I don't even know who won yet! Stay tuned I will let you know the info as soon as I can. Good Luck to you all!"
490179,TC1OZ,2010-08-01 00:52:00,987," Thanks for the update Dave.  Awesome to see the featured celebrity in the corporate contest is actually involved!  What you guys are doing @ facts of fishing is truly cutting edge and I love the show.  I'm starting to suck up now, I'll just stop."
490219,Bass Tard,2010-08-01 06:11:00,128,I love Dave Mercer for posting on OFC.
