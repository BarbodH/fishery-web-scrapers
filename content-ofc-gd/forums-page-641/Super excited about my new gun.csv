496606,ch312,2010-08-20 20:38:00,1590,"i've had my 870 express super mag for 5-6 years and its been through hell but has never failed. i also got the 20"" rifled barrel that makes 3"" outside to outside groups at 125 yards with 2 3/4"" copper solids. it took a while to find her favorite load, but it was worth it.  IMO you dont really need a cantilever. sure its nice so you dont need to re-zero (although you should always take at least one shot before hunting. just buy a nice saddle mount for mounting a scope. this allows you to use the same scope for multiple species. just right down how you adjust for each barrel. it takes 1 shot to re-zero after removing the saddle mount.

496736,Skud,2010-08-21 15:01:00,739,I just bought my cat this model. He is very happy with it. 
496786,NAW,2010-08-21 17:50:00,4022,It came with the cantilever.  Picked up a Bushnel shotgun scope.  Heading out skeet shooting in about 20 minutes.  Got 100 rounds ready to go!
495906,NAW,2010-08-18 20:13:00,4022,"http://www.remington.com/products/firearms/shotguns/model-870/model-870-express-combos.aspx  Picking up my new shotgun this Friday and I'm super Pumped (no pun intended!!).  Black synthetic.  I would have prefered Camo, but black works too!  Getting an 870 express 3 barrel combo.  Turkey, waterfowl, and deer (rear cantalevered for a scope).  Gunna pick up some skeet, and break her in before the duck season starts!!  It's on sale this weekend at Tromley's for $650!"
495924,Chromeblood,2010-08-18 21:03:00,14,I can't wait to pick up my compound bow  been shopping around for a long time and decided on a diamond black ice flx. Ready to drop a buck !
495928,glen,2010-08-18 21:21:00,2641,Good choice on your new gun.  They are bullet proof.
495930,Rustic-Fisher,2010-08-18 21:42:00,826,"If you have not bought it already, check out Le barons on-line!$$$"
495938,AzuluSpookd,2010-08-18 21:56:00,348,"569.00 ! I've never found a good deal at Trombly's....always seem overpriced, especially hunting gear.  http://www.lebaron.ca/pdffiles/web_spec/rem_870expresstrio_web.pdf"
495962,12footspringbok,2010-08-18 23:22:00,459,"I bought my 870 black synthetic taxes in for 4hundy at lebarons 2 years ago. Just came with the 28"" barrel though. Trombleys is OP! You won't be dissapointed with the gun definatly best bang for your buck."
495973,smally21,2010-08-19 00:29:00,993,i had an 870 security/entry gun put 1000's of rounds thru it in drill and competition tons of higher tech options out there but this thing never let me down.  nice choice at any price.
496008,NAW,2010-08-19 02:09:00,4022,I'm going to call Lebarons tomorrow and see if they're going to have that deal on any time soon again.  Thanks for the links eh!  I thought $650 was good.  Lebarons is $90 cheaper..
496013,Steel28,2010-08-19 02:31:00,160,"Good luck with your new gun, I decided to treat myself as well and sold my benelli Supernova and bought Super Black Eagle II in realtree hardwood camo. can't wait to shoot some trap and practice for upcoming seasons."
496017,DRIFTER_016,2010-08-19 02:38:00,10439,"My first gun was an 870 SPS Camo. Super sweet gun, still have it."
496024,ohhenrygsr,2010-08-19 02:52:00,947,Price is Cheaper but customer service is a thing from the pass which Trombly's doesn't lack.  Very knowledgeable mostly the hunting and gun dept
496046,GoneFishin,2010-08-19 03:53:00,349,Aren't they discontinued? I though they were replacing the old 870 with a new version? Could be wrong but either way the express will be my first gun. Never heard a bad word about it and I know more people with that gun then any others combined.
496051,ChrisK,2010-08-19 09:39:00,2772,Great gun. Had mine now for 25 years with no problems. Keep her clean and oiled and it will serve you well.
496054,Tarzan's Jane,2010-08-19 10:51:00,1183,"Being open about owning a gun is risky....I will tell you why.  True story....very recent....told to me by my son who is a police officer.  Father had acquired a gun, son was overheard speaking of it.  Son was followed home.  Son left home.  Two men approached the home, knocked on door, mother answers door.  Two men attack her.  She is tied to a chair, beaten, they want the gun.  Mom does not know where the gun is.  They break her nose.  Mom does not know where the gun is.  They break one finger and wait.  They break another finger and yet another.  Mom does not know where the gun is.  They pour gasoline on her.  Neighbour notices suspicious car, places call to 911.  Something got those two men to leave before lighting a match to her. Nice eh. They were arrested.   She will never be the same.  Be careful."
496055,Jay T,2010-08-19 10:59:00,282,"If you call Trombly's and talk to them they will match the price, they did when I got my CVA. They are also nice to deal with. Enjoy the new purchase."
496066,NAW,2010-08-19 11:54:00,4022," Thats just messed up man!  There are some sick people out there..  I'm not to worried about any OFC'ers coming and beating my wife just to get my registered shotguns..  There are tons of guys on this site that are open about hunting and owning guns. Thanks for you'r input though, very interesting situation.  Outdoorsman, I'll call them today and see if they will price match.  Thanks for the tip."
496079,TJQ,2010-08-19 13:02:00,7806,Nice... yup... its getting to be that time of year again. Taking Avery out for his first deer/moose hunt with the boys this year!!
496083,Harrison,2010-08-19 13:13:00,2202,The hunt camp is a life altering expereince for a young man.    Was for me atleast.
496092,bigbuck,2010-08-19 13:50:00,2449,"The 870 is a nice piece. I have a 20ga Wingmaster that is real easy on the shoulder and an older 12ga 870. Very reliable, outlasted my dad's 12ga Mossberg 500 that broke 2 firing pins at the wrong times."
496111,NAW,2010-08-19 14:47:00,4022,"Just got off the horn with Lebarons, and then Trombly's.  In stock at Lebarons, and $80 cheaper then Trombly's.  Trobly's won't price match Lebarons.. (not the guy I talked to anyways!)  Looks like I'm heading south this weekend instead of north..  Thanks AzuluSpookd!  You saved me some cash!"
496124,AzuluSpookd,2010-08-19 15:29:00,348,"I've tried price matching with Trombly's and they just won't do it.....I haven't been there since two years ago when they wouldn't price match my fish finder...sure they have good customer service...but why go there when you can shop online or order over the phone with Lebarons and Cabela's...  Don't forget Elwood Epps...they will price match and they have a selection that is unbelievable check out their prices online...they have some amazing deals....I bought my last gun off them...a Savage XP10ProHunter in .223 and they beat Trombly's by 200.00 and Cabelas by 100.00 !! That was just their price...great store to deal with, IMHO."
496159,misfish,2010-08-19 17:30:00,29133,"You have til the 22 of this month to get it for 449 at BPS. Check out thier flyer on line.  I was going to buy the cantalevered barrel for mine,but they want what thier selling  the combo for   .  Great all around shot gun."
496163,Zubris21,2010-08-19 17:48:00,563,"Congrats on the new gun.  I'm waiting for my brand new Browning BPS hunter to arrive.  Ordered it last week through Cabelas.  Decided to go with Browning as I already have an older 870 Wingmaster, which I love!  Hope you enjoy the express!"
496176,NAW,2010-08-19 18:21:00,4022,"  Thanks Brian.  I just called BPS and after a 10 minute wait on hold, I got a guy on the phone.  What he told me was it's a 2 barrel combo, and the rifled barrel is not cantalevered, just iron sights..  I think I'm going to hit Lebarons tonight, there open till 9:00."
496440,duber,2010-08-20 14:25:00,220, Much easier for the criminals to just hack into the white elephant gun registery than to troll fishing boards for someone to victomize.  Hope you enjoy the 870.Hard to go wrong with the 870.Just picked up a 20gauge 870 for my daughter.
