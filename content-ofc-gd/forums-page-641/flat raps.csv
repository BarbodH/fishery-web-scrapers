496363,sauce,2010-08-20 10:44:00,219,"Hey! Once I figured out how to make x raps dance, they became confidence lures. The only problem I had was working them in water under about 5 feet or so. Lost quite a few of these fish magnets to snags. This year rapala came out with the flat rap. Its no x rap but I can make it dance and its another magnet. To me, ideal flat rap water is as shallow as 1 ft. Keep the rod tip high and just watch the fish slam'em. No real max depth cuz fish will rise up to bite these babies. I've had a few flat raps fail on me though. Not right away but after bumping bottom a few times the diving bill breaks off rendering them useless. And I mean bumping bottom, not slamming or dragging. Anyone else have this issue? I have one in particular that seems indestructible. But a few others that were total losers in a matter of minutes."
496373,craigdritchie,2010-08-20 11:31:00,1586,Um .... Flat Raps have been around for at least 15 years.
496385,SRT8 smoker craft,2010-08-20 11:55:00,1107, they are new according to there website and I have never seen them until this spring and I always try out new rapala's when they come out.   
496395,Dave Bailey,2010-08-20 12:28:00,1641," Fat Raps have, but this is also the first I have heard of a Flat Rap. But then, I don't get out much."
496396,alexcba,2010-08-20 12:35:00,634,"reason your breaking them is because they were not designed to be a deflection bait, they are meant to swim not bump or drag bottom. you'll need a fatter more durable shallow diving lip if your planning on deflecting it off of structure."
496409,Gregoire,2010-08-20 13:07:00,1397,As was pointed out I think you may have misread flat for fat...
496411,cuzza,2010-08-20 13:18:00,467,"As you're an X-Rap fan already, try the X-Rap Shad Shallow - same depth characteristics as the Flat but a more robust lure."
496438,sauce,2010-08-20 14:22:00,219,"Not using it as a deflection bait. Actually trying to avoid hitting anything with'em now. Just thought they were rather weakly built for a rapala. I'm just interested to hear if others have experienced this same issue. And ya, flat raps are new. Brand new and they work awesome. They advertise the ""hard flashing action"" Try one out and see for yourself. If you fish bass or walleye in shallow water you should have a few of these in your box."
496460,Gregoire,2010-08-20 15:14:00,1397, I have one. I've used it to catch pike before. No problems with it. I've heard that sometimes you can get a bad batch of lures. Did you buy the flat raps all at the same place. Have you contacted rapala?
496482,ehg,2010-08-20 15:56:00,2666,Maybe thinking of DT flat series thought about trying them. These new Flat raps look decent for shallow applications.
496767,Sinker,2010-08-21 16:33:00,8692,"If you take the broken ones in to rapala, they will replace them over the counter.  S."
496792,sauce,2010-08-21 18:17:00,219,"Yep will be contacting rapala for replacements. Between me and a bud we have 6 to return. Only a few bite marks on those ones. I'm thinkin bad batch, they broke too easily. Like I said, I've got one that seems a bit tougher than the rest. Its lookin pretty beat up though."
496801,Duckie,2010-08-21 18:50:00,305,the Jointed Shad Rap (in yellow perch colour) is one of the best baits I have ever used.  so is the X-Rap Shad (non jointed). both are amazing.
496803,Duckie,2010-08-21 18:56:00,305,"those new Flat Raps seem very similar to the discontinued ""Long Cast Minnow"" of a few years ago. this must be the replacement."
496838,Fisherpete,2010-08-21 21:33:00,1814,"Funny, I had 2 of those long cast minnows, they were great on Rice for walleye. The bill broke off of both of them - looks exactly like the bill on the flat raps!"
497600,sauce,2010-08-24 01:12:00,219,"Ya. I remember the long cast minnows. Same bill as a flat, but not a balsa lure. They had the internal weights that shift to the tail on the cast... a lot like an xrap."
497605,moemoe,2010-08-24 01:17:00,352,"I love the flat raps, great trolling bait with lead core for summer pike"
