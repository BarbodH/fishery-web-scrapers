Anybody know a store locally in toronto/surrounding which would actually carry them in stock, or will I have to order them direct from the company? Any suggestions on a good place to have them install the guides(none are the tip-top guide)  I am looking specifically for fuji titanium framed sic guides ...  thanks for the input  -Mark"
