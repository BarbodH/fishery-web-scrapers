497059,cuzza,2010-08-22 15:49:00,467," Yes - me!! Used to race Caterhams before moving to Canada, great fun  Was up at Mosport for some regional races last year and I'll probably head up for the race on Sunday - does it get crazy busy?"
497064,pike n' whities,2010-08-22 16:17:00,131,"ohhhh man, I wish I was still living down there. I'd be ther for sure! Now I got a slummy track up here owned by a moron, lol. Mosport is a super great track! Both the oval AND road portions. The facilities are also unmatched. Anyhow have a great time out there guys! Give me a damage report when you come back"
497118,CLofchik,2010-08-22 19:20:00,854,"Ducati Club Of Canada and their May long weekend is always a fun event. Anyone remember the Players/GM spec Camaro series?  They raced at Mosport with the Trans AM cars, those were fun races.  Always hoped the IMSA GTP beasts would've come back to Mosport but I suppose the ALMS is next best thing"
