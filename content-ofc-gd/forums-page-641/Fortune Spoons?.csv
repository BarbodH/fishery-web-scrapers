496616,fishinguypat,2010-08-20 21:10:00,547,"Hi, I'm thinking of buying fortunespoons ...the glow in the dark ones anyone have any luck with them? in the past?"
496628,scuro2,2010-08-20 22:21:00,904,I don't know about the rest of you but glow in the dark always underproduces regular lures.
496630,canadadude,2010-08-20 22:22:00,769,They work
496633,fishinguypat,2010-08-20 22:43:00,547,yeah but there site says there closed?
496649,canadadude,2010-08-21 00:12:00,769,"Maybe the dude has stopped making them,he used to venture out on the piers selling them they were a good glow spoon. My buddy won the St Catharines Fall Salmon derby in 2006 on a Fortune Spoon.Another good spoon is Moonshines, they make a heavy casting model that works pretty good, I beleive Short Wave in Port Credit has a good selection Glow Green is my favorite."
496650,canadadude,2010-08-21 00:13:00,769,not between 10pm and 5am
496658,fishinguypat,2010-08-21 01:11:00,547,yeah i thought to my self might aswell buy some if they glow and they aren't a bad price either
496752,Burtess,2010-08-21 15:48:00,901,"The big difference with the Fortune Spoons is with the paint finish.  Compared to the finish on glow Cleo's, the Fortune glow lasts about 5X longer, and is a softer more even glow.  Black lights and certain flashes are best for charging the long glows.  Regular flashes don't charge them that well.  Burt"
496907,fishinguypat,2010-08-22 01:11:00,547,so would  an LED light charge them or what?
496941,canadadude,2010-08-22 03:48:00,769,"It will, but not very good the black lights are different then the LED lights"
497127,CLofchik,2010-08-22 19:36:00,854," No, you need the UV of an incandescent or black light.  LEDs don't emit much ultraviolet. Check out surplus & dollar stores for lights to check for counterfeit money.  Cheap, small black light that's good for zapping spoons."
497146,lucabrasi,2010-08-22 20:25:00,114," There are also  Blacklight/UV LEDs on the market, but I don't know if they fare much better than regular LEDs in terms of output. Cheap ones, like the ones used on cap lights, are dim and don't seem nearly violet enough for charging glow spoons."
497230,mikeymikey,2010-08-23 02:16:00,376,"If you want to use a LED flashlight... search ebay for UV LED Flash light that is 3Watt or higher.  As for Fortune spoon, you would want to give it a clear coat spray as outter layer (glow) can chip off."
497235,fishinguypat,2010-08-23 02:32:00,547,i can't contact the guy who sells them   any help?
