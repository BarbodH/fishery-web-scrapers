492763,Nipfisher,2010-08-09 02:43:00,2449,"There is also another version of the washer game called Texas Horseshoes or Hillbilly Horseshoes. It consists of 2 decks about 3' long and about 1' wide. Each deck has 3 holes  (6"") in it in a row from front to back. You place the decks abouth 6' apart and try to toss the washers into the holes. The scoring can be veried but it is usually 1 point for the front hole, 3 points for the middle hole and 5 points for the far hole. Also some points are awarded for all of your washers staying on the deck. Here is a link to the game. http://www.ultimatecampresource.com/site/camp-activity/hillbilly-horseshoes.html"

496881,kickingfrog,2010-08-21 23:28:00,8333," Tailgate at an NFL game and you'll see lots of that being played. Careful, some of them take it pretty serious... and don't like being beat by a Canuck who's never played before."
