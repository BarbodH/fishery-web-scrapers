496886,Muskieman,2010-08-22 00:12:00,2472,Before my wife and I had kids ... I stopped along-side highway 17 and hung on a sign bearing my last name.    For the first time in a long time I got to drive back from Ottawa during daylight hours and decided to stop and take a pic with the kids.     Randy 
496918,Roy,2010-08-22 01:56:00,13728,Nice last name. I used to know some Ways back in the 70's.
