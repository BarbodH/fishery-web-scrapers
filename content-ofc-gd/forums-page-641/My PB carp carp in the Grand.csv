496596,BillsTheBassMan,2010-08-20 20:15:00,932,Beautiful Carp Man - I've seen some monsters trolling around - lots of those to go around for anyone who wants to fish for them.  How was the run?
496892,Trevor0179,2010-08-22 00:34:00,65, The run was real good the thing took off like a bat out of hell the line was peeling off fast the first run had to been about 100 to 115 yards then it was a good ten minute battle with a few 30 to 40 yard dashes all in all it was a good fight lots of fun
