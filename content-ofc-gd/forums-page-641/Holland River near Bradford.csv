497163,express168,2010-08-22 21:33:00,327,"I have caught pike, bass, and catfish in the Holland River from a boat. Hope that helps a little."
497174,ckrb2007,2010-08-22 22:43:00,449,I believe they also catch crappie there as well.
497183,jaydub,2010-08-22 23:15:00,145,I've tried that spot several times and have never had any luck.  It looks like a sweet spot for buckets and pike but I think it is way over fished.
497184,Paully,2010-08-22 23:17:00,712,Unless you wanna dunk worms with 50 other people.. don't bother
497187,Terry,2010-08-22 23:25:00,14456,early spring is ok at times otherwise not much going on there
497190,Guest Rapala Boy,2010-08-22 23:42:00,0,"lol you asked the same thing on off, but were looking to fish at night. It's tough at night at a place like that, but the Stella Maris marina section has more bass and pike than all the other locations at the river i've seen. good luck mate"
