496317,JCRG,2010-08-20 02:05:00,57,"Hi everyone, I gave flipping a try the other day at a local pond... Here's what i picked up...     I fished at a spot that has been producing 1-2 fish on every outing but no luck. I had a bite but failed to hook the fish. After about 1 hour, i switched to Mr. ""Big O"" and on the second cast i got this...    Still lots of learning to do, but this is part of the excitement about bass fishing... Thanks for reading"

496384,MCTFisher9120,2010-08-20 11:53:00,3761,"Nice fish, you will get the hand of it soon enough. It produces some big bass!"
496416,daryl0815,2010-08-20 13:35:00,225,"nice fish, I have just started using flippin jigs too, with no real success, but the big-o produces fish almost every tim I throw it in the water!"
496686,JCRG,2010-08-21 03:10:00,57," Thanks, i will   i'll keep that in mind, thanks!   Good luck, it's a really useful technique to learn   Thanks, and congrats on all those good fish you've been catching   Yeah it's a good crank bait to have, i've been using it a lot this year"
496773,skinny,2010-08-21 16:51:00,442,ok I would like to figure out the flipping and piching thing or the jig and pig thing (just figured out what all that is)but still looking for good info places. oh and what is a big O
496779,Garry2Rs,2010-08-21 17:30:00,1425," Big ""O"" is a shallow running Cotton Cordell bait of the tear drop style.  Most lure companies make a similar bait.   Flippin is a cast named for a town in Arkansas, where the technique was supposedly invented.  Most of us first did this quite naturally, as kids, to get our bait close to a target.  Basically it is an underhand cast using a pendulum motion to swing the bait back-and-forth before dropping it almost silently into a small opening in cover.  You pull about a rod length of line off the reel with your free hand, and have the bait hanging at about the level of the reel.  Casting distance is limited to about twice the length of the rod.  Pitching is a slightly longer underhand cast where the bait is held in the free hand.  The rod tip is first lowered, then raised sharply, at the same time the bait is dropped.  Done with the proper timing, the bait sails out in a smooth arch just above the water.  This cast is limited to about 30 feet.  These techniques are mainly used in dirty water where you can get close to cover without spooking the fish. Garry2R's"
496835,splashhopper,2010-08-21 21:20:00,2931,so that's what you call the technique that I have been using when I ma hanging off the side of big tree branches and tossing my senko's to the shore  And here I thought I had to learn ANOTHER new technique...  Dang!
