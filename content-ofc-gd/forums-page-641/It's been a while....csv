I've been doing lots of fishing, but unfortunately not so much catching, and the camera hasn't always been handy.  Anyways here are a couple photos from early July during the Salmon run on the Stikine/Tahltan Rivers.  Both fish are Chinook, we caught quite a few in the couple trips we went out, but have few pictures to show.  Small jack, this guy went back to where he came from...    And this one went to the dinner table, weighed in at 24lbs and was my very first salmon...  "

497142,TerryC,2010-08-22 20:17:00,196,Nice fish and great looking water in that first pic.
497177,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-08-22 22:51:00,0,Nice salmon! Are those rivers in B.C?
497251,Zubris21,2010-08-23 03:28:00,563,"Yup both rivers are in Northern BC.  The Stikine along with the Skeena and Nass are under threat.  Shell wants to mine coal bed methane in the area where these 3 rivers originate.. Really beautiful country, fortunately the government has somewhat appeased the local concerns with a moratorium on mining in the area.  If they do go ahead though it would be terrible as these are 3 of the more important fisheries on the coast."
