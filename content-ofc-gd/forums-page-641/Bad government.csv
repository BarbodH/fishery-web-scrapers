497442,Billy Bob,2010-08-23 19:04:00,5865," Then how do you explain the EXPLOSION of JOBS and DEVELOPMENT in many of the southern states like NC, etc.........  BTW if not happy with your private sector job you can always leave Canada and head to Cuba or China where they have your type of socialism but I wouldn't recommend it.  Bob"
497445,cram,2010-08-23 19:15:00,1733," Yep - Johnny should move to Cuba, China, or buy a time machine and move to 1980s russia."
497447,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-08-23 19:16:00,0," Debt? Using taxes from rich states like California and New York to pay minimums? They are under developed states and will work for less.  Why? Are there no public sector jobs in Canada?  Actually at the current rate, there wont be very soon....  And I'm a socialist, not a communist."
497450,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-08-23 19:22:00,0, You know? I remember talking to some immigrants from other countries and they were telling me that in the old days before industrialization enslaved their country? Everyone lived happy and no one went without food. Everyone had their piece of land and owned a home and didn't have to possess a 25 to 50 year mortgage to do so.
497453,cram,2010-08-23 19:27:00,1733, Any socialist-based economies that you think are doing well (where you'd want to live)?  btw - New York and California are two of the biggest private sector innovation states in the US...remove the private sector and they both become very poor.
497493,Jer,2010-08-23 20:55:00,1426,"   Less poverty? You would have to ask the people in food lines for hours to get a loaf of bread.  I remember the USSR falling due to massive public revolt. Thank goodness they kept the tanks in check for once.  Funny how Western Europe was able to thrive after the war, while Eastern Europe, under the yoke of your mighty USSR, wallowed in poverty and under dictatorship for decades.  With all due respect Johnny, it seems you need to study your history. Socialism spawned the Berlin Wall, not so much to keep others out, but to keep their own people from fleeing to the west for freedom and the chance for a better life.  Maybe they just wanted to buy their liquor from a non-government store, perish the thought."
497496,Billy Bob,2010-08-23 21:02:00,5865,Johnny ole boy you got me thinking.....not in your direction but still thinking.........  There are not too many services that government and the private sector compete in but I did think of one......mail delivery of PACKAGES...only packages because here in the USA it's illegal for FedEx or UPS to deliver FIRST CLASS MAIL (gee I wonder WHY)......but anyways there is no comparison here....FedEx and UPS are MUCH better then the USPS delivering packages from point A to point B.  Maybe you have a couple of examples in your favor...I would be interested in listening....  BTW the ONLY reason the cold war ended is because the Russians couldn't compete with the USA in technology. Capitalism brings out the BEST in EVERYONE.  Bob
497498,Roy,2010-08-23 21:09:00,13728,"I hope your friend can handle paying her way or get the problem resolved.. If the 407 was in Russia, your friend would be in jail. We're way off topic now."
497282,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-08-23 12:31:00,0," Actually it worked out quite well and there was less poverty in the USSR then there is in North America. But there was corruption there as well. But what I suggest is not communism. Where the gov not only owns enterprises but everything else. I believe in people being able to own a home and such.  The reason the USSR fell is because they were being undermined by an emperor with no clothes. All the money the west used to undermine the USSR was made out of thin air.  Can you imagine if I had my own country and I could make money out of thin air? I can lure the best scientists and minds away from all the countries.  Its like Canada trying to compete with the US. They are taking all our doctors and with what? Debt. Money backed by absolutely nothing.  If money was still backed by gold, Russia's economy would be massive.   But the main reason the USSR fell was? World war II. Russia's economy and Europe's as well was left in ruins. And because of North America's geological position? Its land was not attacked and its economy remained intact. It Germany or Japan were located where Mexico is? The North American economy would have been shattered, and Russia would have been bragging about how Socialism is superior.  Capitalism is not working, Thats for sure. It works for a bit, when you are going on a buying spree with your debt dollars but then when it comes time to pay the piper, your in trouble, because people over spend when the bill is left to someone else(the taxpayer)."
497283,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-08-23 12:34:00,0," The reason for that is because they outsourced all the manufacturing jobs and you cant compete with China's cheap labour force. All there is left is government jobs.  Government jobs are great here in Canada and are accountable, but you need manufacturing(you need to be producing valuable goods) to pay for it.  It should be illegal to import a product that can be made domestically."
497286,Roy,2010-08-23 12:42:00,13728," But then you'd have no fishing tackle, rods nor reels, Johnny. You'd also probably have to walk to work at your government job. I don't think you want to go there. Really."
497295,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-08-23 13:03:00,0, No I probably wouldn't be waiting for Shimano gear that is being made in Malaysia. When it could have been made right here in North America and no shortage of workers.  Walk to work? Explain that one.  Oh yes. I do want to go there.
497354,Billy Bob,2010-08-23 15:22:00,5865," You are not correct in the above statement for several reasons. The WNY area (Buffalo) has been in a recession for OVER 30 years, WAY before China became a player in manufacturing products for anyone. However, we did lose MANY manufacturing jobs here that were the staple of the area, like the Steel Plants, etc......HOWEVER, over that  period of time MORE and MORE government jobs have been added by the politicians to pad their side with additional VOTES to stay in their political jobs....AND because of those political jobs our TAXES have SKYROCKETED to the highest in the NATION causing even more businesses to move the hell out of the area which AGAIN raises TAXES even more.  The top employers in WNY are NYS, Erie County, City of Buffalo and the School Systems. NONE produce any products or are in competition with anyone to hold down cost. ALL are driving even more private sector businesses out of the area.  BTW what do you do for a living. Is it a government job or a private sector job ?"
497359,jedimaster,2010-08-23 15:29:00,3472,You wanna here something even better. When I got divorced my Ex took the car and transfered it in her name. Plate and Vehicle transfered into a new name. 6 months later I get a bill saying she was on the 407 and I have to pay for it. I called them and told them the plate was transferred months ago and they said too bad its listed in there system under my name and I have to pay it and they sent it to collections.  Nice eh.
497364,duckdog,2010-08-23 15:38:00,162,Great idea who ever travels the 407 has t o pay for that expense  \
497380,Cudz,2010-08-23 16:04:00,2652,I have one thing to say about the 407.  Bike carrier on your vehicle with bikes on it.
497389,rylan,2010-08-23 16:33:00,134,"I do believe the person that bought the 407 is George Soros -- he is the same gentlment that is trying to build the NAFTA super highway from Mexico into Canada.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Soros  I read somewhere that he plans on building the laresg sea port in mexico and will take away business in every western port  The highway will stretch from the border ( texas/mexico ) and travel north. This will highway will also house gas lines, power lines and rail. YES it will be a TOLL road.    Not sure if this is true -- but someone told me one time that OUR Provincial Parks are used as collateral from the debt we the people in cure -- I know this happens in the USA. But un-sure of Canada -- we have to watch out for that."
497394,Fish Farmer,2010-08-23 16:55:00,2234,"So it takes you 5 minutes longer to get were your going. Save 30 to 40 bucks and relax. It's beyond me why anyone would use the 407.   It could grow up in weeds, if it waited for me to take it. Billy Bob, my blood pressure is up with yours on this one After reading this post, they helped lock the door for me."
497409,cram,2010-08-23 17:53:00,1733," Johnny -- public sector is in general less efficient than private, no matter how you slice it.  There's no way that a 9-4:30 slow-as-molasses culture is going to outperform a private company that is gunning for it  There are exceptions - healthcare is one of them where the right-to-have-it is more important than the efficiency in delivering it - but in general, i think 9 out of 10 people who are familiar iwth public sector efficiencey would disagree with you."
497416,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-08-23 18:21:00,0, If there is all government jobs and no manufacturing? High taxes and debt is all that can sustain the state.....Which can explain the recession......  Well outsourcing is to blame. Maybe not China 30 years ago. But outsourcing nonetheless.  Asia and Europe have been taking jobs for awhile. And NAFTA did not help NY out much either.  Where in your opinion did all the manufacturing jobs go 30 years ago? They went somewhere since New York's population is second only to LA. And their consumption rate would be quite high.  It is clear outsourcing of manufacturing jobs is the culprit. Whether it is to another state or another country. Everytime we shop at walmart we are shooting ourselves in the foot. But now most places are selling imports.....
497420,cram,2010-08-23 18:24:00,1733, I would bet that 95% of what you buy comes from outside the province.  Would you be willing to have less (because you could afford less) if it meant supporting local businesses?
497422,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-08-23 18:26:00,0," I totally disagree. The public sector is accountable(the people/voters have a say in its efficiency). The private sector is not.  Can you imagine if the gov ran the Toronto Maple leafs? If the gov didn't maintain a competitive team, we could vote the Coach, GM and everyone else out of office!lol  The private sector rewards their staff/CEO's millions of dollars in bonuses for their incompetence!"
497426,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-08-23 18:30:00,0," Sorry but this argument is nonsense. I can bring in some stolen tractor trailers of goods. Would you be willing to rather have less, when you could have more for less?  Yes I'd be willing to have less, so more people can have jobs and there would be a lot less drain on our tax dollars threw social services.  So in essence. I would have more, my family would have more, my friends and neighbors would have more and everyone would be happy."
497427,cram,2010-08-23 18:31:00,1733, Man oh man....the private sector is held accountable by an open market that determines whether or not they stay in business.  I assume you work in public sector.
497429,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-08-23 18:34:00,0, How naive to not know that the private sector has pretty much already cornered the market.  And will stay in business regardless. IF WORSE COMES TO WORSE THEY HAVE OUR TAX DOLLARS TO BAIL THEM OUT.
497430,cram,2010-08-23 18:39:00,1733, Do you work in public sector?
497431,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-08-23 18:46:00,0, I usually work in the private sector but not by choice. Believe me. Anyone here who would not like a government job backed by a union is just fooling themselves. Why do you ask?
497434,Billy Bob,2010-08-23 18:50:00,5865," Where did all the JOBS go over the last 30 YEARS...simple to areas, like southern states and other countries that have LOWER TAXES BECAUSE OF LESS GOVERNMENT....it's that SIMPLE.  And WNY has lost a LOT of it's population because of it's HIGH TAXES which are the highest in the NATION. The City of Buffalo alone has less than 250,000 people left and most are either on welfare or have a government job.....SAD !  !  !  Now answer the $64,000.00 question.......do you work a government job or in the private sector ?  ?  ?"
497436,rylan,2010-08-23 18:53:00,134,Billy Bob   You need to watch out-- your president is after your retirement now-- check this out:  http://www.eutimes.net/2010/08/us-said-preparing-new-laws-to-seize-americans-retirement-accounts/
497438,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-08-23 18:54:00,0, Not nice. I'd be fuming! That is legalized robbery/extortion.
497439,BillsTheBassMan,2010-08-23 18:56:00,932,"So, how 'bout them fish"
497440,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-08-23 19:00:00,0," Sure they have lower taxes. They are poor nations. You cant get blood out of a stone. This is all about exploitation of the poor. Not taxes or less government. The poor have been exploited since the beginning of economics.  Quebec in Canada were smart. They would not let another province, let alone another country import stuff that they can produce domestically and that is the way it should be.  Reminds me of Detroit, where I think racism may have been a factor.  Or is it, they lost the population because people moved away looking for WORK?  I already answered that question. Private but not by choice."
497441,Billy Bob,2010-08-23 19:00:00,5865, The bugger can't touch my RR Retirement that I have been collecting for over 7 years already...
496815,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-08-21 19:30:00,0," Prove it.    Thats ridiculous, considering she was never made aware that she had a charge in the first place. MOT should have updated the information when she updated her license. Furthurmore by law when they issued the ""final complaint and plate denial"" By law they have to contact the ministry and make sure they have the right address. This was done in 2008. Considering the license was updated in 1998 and the plate was retired in 2000, they should have looked into it, but hey, they dont have to because they have us by the short hairs for sure!"
496816,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-08-21 19:42:00,0,"The dumb thing is that MOT did not update her plates either until recently. Maybe because the plate was retired or whatever.But the MOT automatically updates the plates when you change your license information.  Why should she pay for MOT and 407 incompitence? it doesn't surprise me since when we asked how much the fine was, we received 3 different figures. One from the court house, one from the drivers license place and one from the 407."
496817,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-08-21 19:47:00,0, Cost recovery basis???? Traffic levels??? It says nothing about being able to charge 30% interest and then forcing people to pay at the cost of tax payers.
496829,cram,2010-08-21 20:55:00,1733," There is also a maximum % interest that a company is legally allowed to charge.  Suspect 30% exceeds it, otherwise you know the credit card companies would charge that much.  You may want to check it out.  Only other idea -- the toronto sun loves this stuff.  You may get on their front page if you make your story crisp enough.  Its not your fault they have been billing the wrong address."
496833,rylan,2010-08-21 21:11:00,134,I have said it many times on this site--- why wont you listen        They will keep doing this until we STAND up and fight.    When is ENOUGH- enough.  And if we dont stop them now --- just think what could be next!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!     I dont want to find out and I am DONE sitting here here and listening to you all witch about this kind of crap  -- but thats all you do- LETS GO people-- we need to stand up NOW before its to late.
496843,Big Cliff,2010-08-21 21:55:00,6899,  But we are Canadian..... We won't!
496853,ctranter,2010-08-21 22:14:00,543,"Im with Cliff, I've heard enough horror stories like this to never set wheels on the 407.  I'd rather sit in terrible golden horseshoe any day than let those greedy buggers have my money."
496859,mercman,2010-08-21 22:18:00,7054," nope, we wont, cause we rather moan about it, rile a bunch of people up, and then wait for someone else to do something bout it. thats why everyone loves us so much"
496868,knightfisher,2010-08-21 22:36:00,237,"Fascism, google the word.  Part of the definition- when government and corporations work hand and glove. Our government working for the new owners of the 407.  Did the bail out fall into this catagory ? You bet !  Also as I understand it, because the 407 deal was done with a private company, the particulars of the sale can be concealed. Sure we the public were given a few details, but try to get a copy of the contract of sale, being that this affects us, the public.  Not going to happen.  The word sheeple comes to mind."
496871,grt1,2010-08-21 22:41:00,638,kinda makes me glad that I live in the north and far far away from the toll roads
496991,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-08-22 12:51:00,0,"Yup. It seems like both parties have been selling Canada off to the highest bidders(especially the conservatives that are in bed with the US) and pocket money on the side. With the excuse they weren't making money. If the gov wasn't making money, how the heck can a private corporation? Makes no sense. Its all Bull. And then they complain about not having any money after they sell off their infrastructure and they start raising taxes. Shameful.  The worst is lies like the beer store and the LCBO not making money and having to privatize!   I think I will look into starting my own political movement."
497011,Jer,2010-08-22 13:44:00,1426,   The Beer Store has always been privately owned and the LCBO probably should be.
497032,scuro2,2010-08-22 14:24:00,904," Yeah lets get that Canadian tea party going   so that we can get US funding for our ""grass roots"" ""advocacy"" group also.  The ignorant are played like fiddles.  If the beef is the 407, than remember it was Mike Harris and his ""common sense"" revolution that sold that government highway off to private interests. The people who tell you to vote for them because they will get rid of the shackles of government and cut red tape are the same people who agreed to the sale and the conditions of the sale. I don't know enough about the sale but I'd bet my last dollar that one of the conditions of sale was that our Ontario government would be the collection agency for those private interests."
497041,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-08-22 14:56:00,0, Really And why may I ask should the government sell off a big cash cow like the LCBO?   And from what I understand? The beer store was bought out not too long ago. They changed the logos and everything.
497045,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-08-22 15:02:00,0, Yup. The elites are behind the tea movement in America also. How do you think they are receiving all that free air time. A true grass root movement would have been left out in the cold.  Apparently the gov told the 407 in 2000 that they no longer were going to collect for the 407 but in 2005 the Gov started to again. All I know is that the tax payer is getting the short end of the stick! From what could have been potential income for the province is now a drain.
497076,scuro2,2010-08-22 16:45:00,904,"http://www.todaystrucking.com/news.cfm?intDocID=14037&CFID=1265779&CFTOKEN=99321162 ...the Ontario Divisional Court has issued a unanimous decision ordering the Ontario Registrar of Motor Vehicles to comply with the ""statutory obligation"" to deny vehicle permits to individuals who refuse to pay their 407 ETR tolls. In their ruling, the Honourable Mr. Justice James D. Carnwath, Madam Justice Joan L. Lax and Madam Justice Katherine E. Swinton ruled that ""the Registrar had no discretion to refuse plate denial"" and therefore ordered the Registrar to begin denying plates, the highway operators said....407 ETR says that plate denial was in place while the highway was owned and operated by the previous Ontario government and the practice was a key part of the 1998 legislation allowing the sale of the highway to the company.  To sell the highway they had to introduce a bill since the highway belonged to the people( you and me). It was at this point that changes could have been made but instead Mike Harris gave the farm away. When you curse about the 407 make sure you invoke his name."
497110,Billy Bob,2010-08-22 19:03:00,5865,"I took that 40expensivehighway once and NEVER again...come on, are they NUTS....40 miles each way cost me over Thirty US dollar$ (back when our dollar was at about 30% premium.  I always thought our NYS Thruway was a rip off but not anymore when compared to 407...I can go 100 miles on the NYS Thruway and it only cost $5  BTW whoever heard of a government selling a highway to a private firm (I heard it's French) so they can in turn charge the hell out of the citizens without any representation.......makes NO SENSE to me anyway you fillet it.  And it's just a matter of time until the crapper tax takes affect."
497133,Jer,2010-08-22 19:51:00,1426,"   It's not what I consider the role of government, to make money on a retail enterprise.  The Beer Store was originally opened as Brewers Retail and was a joint venture between Molson, Labatt's and Carling-Okeefe, albeit under strict government regulation. With all the recent buy-outs and merging of our brewing industry, I coudn't say who has ownership anymore, but I'm positive it isn't the provincial government.  The 407 I agree was a farce. Public infrastructure should never be in the hands of private corporations. Public control of these types of things is what I do consider the role of government."
497136,aplumma,2010-08-22 19:58:00,6896, If you need any help with funding give me a call we can do lunch.   Art
497182,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-08-22 23:12:00,0," What I consider to be the role of the government is to maintain peace and order and the well being of ALL its citizens. And for that you need money. The more enterprises the gov controls, the more money they have at their disposal, to supply social services to its citizens.  All the privatization of government infrastructure has weakened the position of government and strengthened corporations whose main interests are of their own and not of the people.  The LCBO brings in all kinds of revenue which is put into all kinds of social services that benefit the public. Put that money into private hands and that money will only benefit the very few that profit from it.  The more infrastructure the gov owns, the more equality and less poverty there will be. Heck I even think the GOV should own the leafs and bring in an NFL franchise!"
497248,fishinguypat,2010-08-23 03:09:00,547,Only in Canada...
497257,cram,2010-08-23 03:59:00,1733," The gov't is - in general - really crap at delivering a service with any efficiency that would rival private sector.....but i agree that the 407 deal is a farce.  Problem is the deal was cut a LONG time ago.  No point arguing it now.  If it wasn't overturned a few yrs ago when it was proven they were overbilling tons of ontario citizens (or billing people who hadn't been on the 407), it certainly isn't going to be overturned because your friend didn't pay her actually incurred bills (whether she knew about them or not)."
497262,Jer,2010-08-23 09:56:00,1426,"  OK comrade, how did that all work out in the former Soviet Union?"
497277,Billy Bob,2010-08-23 12:08:00,5865, EXACTLY what I was thinking....  You want WASTE and INEFFICIENCY then just add more and more government.  Take my area for example...pretty soon we will only have government jobs here. Then what ?  ?  ?
497280,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-08-23 12:17:00,0," If that were the case then we should privatize our health care again, dont you think? And anyone with half a brain knows universal healthcare is a more better system for the majority of the citizen's. Private health care benefits mostly the rich.  You'd think that a government as rich as Canada's would be more efficient than any private sector, unless it is competing against another country with deeper pockets."
496731,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-08-21 14:23:00,0,"OK. First it was the vehicle tax, that we have to pay now. I think $60 a year. Then it was the H.S.T., now I went to buy a new TV and there is a $26 Recycling fee you have to pay that you get back when your TV is returned.  Now I think this was the final straw. A friend of mine that hasn't driven for 10 years decides to get their license again. Only to find out that there is a charge on the 407 of $700.  She has never been on the 407 but she has lent out her vehicle in the past. The problem is that the plate was registered under another address, even though she updated her license, with the new address in 1998. So this 407 charge of $35 has now ballooned to $700 at 30% interest because the bill was being delivered to the wrong address.  She was never made aware. This is either incompetence on the part of the Ministry of Transportation or the 407.  Apparently when the sale was made, the new owners were supposed to collect, but as of 2005, OUr government is now required to foot the bill to collect for the 407. What a sale hey! We sell them a highway and are still stuck paying for it! Us tax paying Canadians are getting ripped off once again. If the new owners cannot afford to stay in business, they should just sell it back to who the 407 really belongs to. The tax payer!  Why should the gov be responsible for collecting for these crooks that are not only charging 30% interest, but doing it at the expense of the tax payer?  Going to contact the ministry of Transportation!  We have one of the most productive resource based economies in the world and yet somehow after all the lies we were tricked to believe that we have to be heavily taxed to compete in the global market and sustain our economy when all we really need is buyers of our resources and there is no shortage of customers there.  End of rant!"
496735,Big Cliff,2010-08-21 15:00:00,6899,"I refuse to use the 407, they are the most arrogant   I have ever had the displeasure of dealing with. Good luck but you might as well tell your friend to just suck it up and pay because 407 don't care if it is their fault or not and our wonderful government gives them the right to do it!"
496739,Duckie,2010-08-21 15:06:00,305,"I actually really like the 407. it saves a lot of time depending on your route and it is such an easy drive compared to the constantly plugged up QEW.  one tip that helps is to get your 407 bill billed directly to your credit card.  so when you pay your credit card at the end of the month, you pay the 407 bill too.  makes it very simple.  having said that, I think your friend should try and fight it. tell them what happened and see if the charges can be waived."
496742,tb4me,2010-08-21 15:12:00,3295,Had the same thing happen to me. I used the 407 in 98 when it first came out. I never bothered to change my address on my licence so in 2008 when I had to renew my plate stickers they wouldnt let me untill I cleared up my 407 bill. You could imagine the sinking feeling I had when they told me it was $680.00.   Here I thought all this time I had goten away with not paying for the one trip. LOL was I ever wrong. 10 years of interest on a $30.00 bill. Never again after that. There should be a way to get that interest back. I guess if somone owed me $$ id want interest too though. Its d ouble edged sword this time. She will have ot pay it trust me I tried. I was sooo mad I even considered giving up my licence. That would never work thou.
496743,cram,2010-08-21 15:13:00,1733,407 had a well documented problem a few years ago around accidentally improper billing and now have a grievance # to settle disputes.  Suspect the gov't made (or at least asked) them do this.  Your friend may watn to find that # and plead her case.....
496746,Guest gbfisher,2010-08-21 15:17:00,0,The 407 owes me $20 from 6 years back. You can bet I never hear from them or did they ever send me a cheque for the amount owing....lol  Not having 407 mail is fine by me.

496756,Terry,2010-08-21 16:12:00,14456,"I had the same thing happen to me, never drove on their stinking highway , but got a bill. couldn't get my license till it was paid  happened again about 6 months ago... if you want to fight it with them on the phone you have to set up an account to even talk to them...if you have never used their toll road and never will, why would you want to set up an account to tell them they made a mistake...well I found an email address and sent about 40 emails first ones told them they made a mistake and the middle ones told them I could prove me and my truck was somewhere else that day...(even though I didn't know what day it was...you have to set up that account I was talking about to find out the details) the final 10 emails used language that the bad word filters here would never let through...and they quit sending me bills......"
496759,Dave Bailey,2010-08-21 16:16:00,1641,"I've heard of some people getting cheap revenge by sending in a payment that is a few cents over the amount owing. This then goes into the 407 computer as a credit, and they keep sending you a bill every month showing it. It costs postage to tell you that you are credited with a few cents, and you get a chuckle at their expense."
496768,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-08-21 16:34:00,0," I have no problem with the 407. I have a problem with our government selling it and then having to pay to collect their bills, so in other words, eventually the gov gave it away for free. They should have never sold it and we should not be using tax payers dollars to collect for them."
496770,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-08-21 16:43:00,0," I tried that number and managed to get $200 deducted. But that still is not enough in my opinion. These crooks are still stealing $450+ dollars in interest that should not have been added! This is legalized robbery.  Went as high as the 407 umbudsman and they basically said there is nothing they could do. In other words they are good for nothing.  Now I am contacting the ministry of transportation! Since it may also be their error for not updating the plates when the license was updated. Not only that but by law they(407) are supposed to contact the person when the final bill and plate denial is sent. They used outdated information. Also considering the plate was retired in 2000, you'd think they would put 2 and 2 together."
496778,ontariofisherman,2010-08-21 17:28:00,52,"I had the same problem, 2 yrs later I get a bill. So I call them and start fighting with them and the lady told me I would lose my license. I asked her to provide me with the proof that I was on there, she told me they take pics of the plates and would send me the copy of the pics. 2 weeks later she calls me and say not to worry about it, they could not find the pics anymore. The worst part was after i started to think about it more, I remembered that I had used the highway."
496785,tb4me,2010-08-21 17:47:00,3295,So let me get this right. The goverment of ontario built the road? Then sold it to a private company? Yet our tax dollars go towards collecting the profit for them? Not to mention the tax dollars paying for policing a privately owned highway. Unreal. Im in the wrong dman business.Geez
496787,Dave Bailey,2010-08-21 17:55:00,1641,"I could make a comment about the politicians in power at the time, possible Swiss bank accounts and/or vacation villas, etc. But then the lawyers would descend, and I admit my suspicions are based on sheer cynicism."
496789,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-08-21 18:07:00,0," That is correct. What a deal hey?  When is the next highway being built and where can I bid!  Its bad enough our electricity bills just went up. Now they announced they are making power out of human waste! Great!No more polluting our water!! Progress? Some how it always equates to us paying more money.  There probably going to put an environmental tax on every time we flush the toilet. Just like although our garbage is now all recycled into fuel or reused, we are paying more then we ever have for garbage removal!"
496790,Spiel,2010-08-21 18:11:00,9065,"  Johnny, head down the 407 to Hamilton and I'll share my beer and percs with ya, free! It won't solve anything but you won't care.  "
496794,Guest gbfisher,2010-08-21 18:26:00,0,  watch it...Them percs at your age will stop you from regular morning visits to the porcelain throne.   what ever makes ya feel good I guess...  Oh ya...that's right...You won't care much anyway.
496795,Spiel,2010-08-21 18:33:00,9065, LOL.....That's what the beers for.   
496796,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-08-21 18:35:00,0," Hey it works in America. They don't call them the prozac nation for nothing.lol  I'm in a cast right now so as soon as I run out of my oxycocet, I'll take you up on that offer!"
496797,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-08-21 18:36:00,0, Maybe we have just found a way to save on the flushing tax ahead.
496806,OhioFisherman,2010-08-21 19:05:00,6623,""" Hey it works in America. They don't call them the prozac nation for nothing.lol ""   LMAO Johnny ! They do? Probably because because some here worry about some of our leaders are selling Turnpikes ( toll roads ), prisons, they want to privatize Social Security, don`t allow competitive bidding on drugs supplied to patients and paid for under medicare and medicaid.  We seem to have trouble dealing with disasters, Katrina, oil spills. LOL the military and industrial complex may pick our wars? because we have made friends with the communists and it would be foolish to attack some country you are deeply in debt to?  When our crooks get voted out of office or face term limits? They then switch sides and the favors are returned! They go to work for the companies they supported!  Things have changed, a good war now has to last 8 or 10 years so the companies can maximize their profits!  LMAO, Prozac please, make it a double!"
496808,smally21,2010-08-21 19:12:00,993,"not standing up for the 407 lets be clear!  bunch of crooks however....  the 407 pays huge fees to the opp to patrol the highway, taxpayers make money on it. more huge fees paid to the mot for collection/extortion, taxpayers dont pay for it.  my experience with the change of address - just because you changed your plate with the mot doesn't mean you have changed your plate with the 407, they are seperate entities. the 407 said that i had to change my address with them as they only check the plate once and after that it is your problem to update your account info. kind of reasonable but the obvious question to ask them is why do they charge the ""plate fee"" each time you use the highway. if they are not checking the plate against the mot records, why are you charged for this service?  so making this argument that they had charged me to 'run' the plate - which would have provided my new address - but had not actually done it, all interest charges and fees were dropped, just had to pay the bill for use.  again - not standing up for the asshats at the 407. good luck to you in your battle with a faceless soulless corporation that has us by the short hairs for about 90 more years.  ps might want to see how much of the highway belongs to the teachers pension fund...."
496811,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-08-21 19:15:00,0," Dont get me started on all that!  What burns me is all the mind altering drugs they are giving the kids with all the new diagnosis like ADD. Increase sugar intake, violent TV and video games and presto. You get hyper kids. But thats another topic!  Its like that movie Aeon flux I think its called. Where they want to drug the entire society into mindless zombies. That movie was a warning to those who were listening.  Pharmaceutical stocks are going threw the roof....."
496813,smally21,2010-08-21 19:23:00,993,"some further 407 info from the bill of sale. notice the part about rate increases and clawbacks for slowmoving traffic (cause its great to pay for stopped highways).  Safety            The province will ensure the continued safety in the operation, construction and maintenance of Highway 407. The Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) will continue to provide traffic patrol and traffic law enforcement on Highway 407, and the Ministry of Transportation (MTO) will enforce compliance with provincial safety standards, as it does on all other provincial highways. The new owner will pay for OPP and MTO enforcement services on a cost-recovery basis.  Tolls             The agreement includes an innovative toll-rate mechanism aimed at relieving traffic congestion on existing major routes. The province will have the ability to claw back toll revenues if pre-set traffic levels on Highway 407 are not met. Tolls can be adjusted by two per cent per year plus inflation for the first 15 years, and thereafter, by inflation only. This would mean that tolls could increase by about three cents per kilometre over the first 15 years.  Financial penalties will be imposed on the consortium if both the tolls are increased in excess of the specified limits and specified traffic levels are not met."
496814,OhioFisherman,2010-08-21 19:27:00,6623,"More like the movie running man? stay home watch tv don`t complain, big brother will tell you what is good? based on the deals the politicians running big brother make."
