450957,fish_fishburn,2010-04-02 11:59:00,1311,"Good luck Raptorfan,bring one home for dinner."
450958,StoneFly,2010-04-02 12:08:00,574,"I hate to say it...but I bet tommorrow will be a zooo where you are going,..and the lack of a good rain for a while means 'If' there are any fish left down below,..they are gonna be pretty colouored  and hurtin from all this warm weather."
451085,raptorfan,2010-04-02 23:26:00,126,"Well stone fly, you were pretty much dead on.  The traffic there wasn't as bad as I expected, but the bite wasn't there at all.  Out of all the people I saw fishing on the 2 miles of river we fished, I only saw one hen landed.  I must say though it was an absolutely gorgeous morning to be out, and the scenery was fantastic (I love summer ladies  :D ).  With all this said though, I did FINALLY land my first fish on a centerpin!!!  Saw my float dip a bit, set the hook and thought I missed it, till I saw a nice swell under the water and the line started to spin off my reel.  My heart started racing.......then I noticed all the fins on the fish.....I had hooked a sucker in the arse!!!!  Ah well, still landed my first fish on a centerpin....lol  Shawn"

451222,raptorfan,2010-04-03 02:51:00,126,"Another positive I took out of it was I think I am getting my bait in the right spots.  If I am getting a sucker in the belly, I must be staying pretty close to the bottom of the pools I am fishing.  My casting accuracy and control is getting much better, as is my drift control.  Many positives to take out of today.  I am always an optimist  Shawn"
451237,BillM,2010-04-03 03:16:00,17367,"I just got home after leaving the house this morning at 3am.  Best day of 2010 to date, double/triple headers, fresh chromers from the lake and piles and piles of fish.  I'm going to bed, lol..  Shawn, congrats on getting your first fish on a pin!!"
451239,raptorfan,2010-04-03 03:23:00,126,Awesome Bill!  I would have been out that long probably as well if it wasn't for an easter dinner this afternoon and my bowling league tonight.  My boy did ask me when I got home though if we could go tomorrow (was very suprised he asked!) so we are gonna hit up the spot again for 3 hrs in the morning before yet another easter dinner.......
