449946,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-03-30 17:28:00,0,"thanks for all the help OFC.  this will go a long way in helping the development of this park.  from what i understand, the school has already fundraised 13000 dollars in hopes of getting about 50 000 in total.  this prize money would help out a lot!  as you can see, these kids aren't just asking for a handout!  these young kids are working their butts off to get donations and keep everyone voting.  once again, thanks OFC... class acts, the lot of ya!"

449739,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-03-30 02:28:00,0,"An elementary school in my hometown of Sault Ste. Marie is in the runnings to get $5000 in new playground equipment through an online video submission contest.  Despite our small size, we as a community have rallied to vote ourselves near the top.  In 2009, our city lost a soldier in combat and we wish to name the park after him, as the equipment will go to his old elementary school.  Thank you for your time!  You can vote here - It is Queen Elizabeth Public School (currently in 1st): http://projects.kaboom.org/voting/elections/video_2010"
