450184,danbouck,2010-03-31 01:11:00,4380,"Packed up the fishing gear and attached it to the bike trailer that the kids ride in and went to the ol' fishin hole. I had another night where I just couldn't get the hook to stick. But ended up getting 2 to shore. The last one put up a great fight, the kids were just a screaming in excitement.  I'll be back at it tomorrow night and a few of us are hitting Erie on Friday (hopefully I'll stay dry this time   ).  Didn't bother taking a pic of the first one. But here is the second.  "
450193,MJL,2010-03-31 01:23:00,2427,Nicely done Dan...Great to hear the kids got excited too.  Very tempted to break out the carp gear soon.
450231,hammercarp,2010-03-31 02:12:00,964,WTG! Dan.
450246,splashhopper,2010-03-31 02:45:00,2931,hmmmm.... maybe I will hit a trib off of Erie myself right after Pike season closes tomorrow.  Looks like Dan and kids are having fun.
450250,solopaddler,2010-03-31 02:52:00,8605,Yech carp!
450280,Victor,2010-03-31 07:09:00,1609,I'm so jealous that you have a honeyhole so close to home that'd produce this time of the year  Nice work!
450302,danbouck,2010-03-31 10:57:00,4380, I'll post some nice lookin fish if ya take me on your next trip
450303,Paully,2010-03-31 11:05:00,712,Corn worms or bread?
450304,danbouck,2010-03-31 11:07:00,4380," corn, but I'm trying a secret recipe tonight."
450329,blaque,2010-03-31 12:31:00,2419,Another Alice in Chains reference........good man
450403,Harrison,2010-03-31 15:57:00,2202," Awesome bud!!!  Great to see the kids liking it!  Grab a zip lock, throw in some whole kernal corn and some vanilla extract, keep it in the frige overnight.  Not really a secret but works."
450453,danbouck,2010-03-31 17:58:00,4380," I'll be sure to try that, thanks"
450490,Marko,2010-03-31 21:02:00,854,Nice fish man!  Its a beautiful fish and don't let anyone tell you otherwise:rolleyes: lol
450565,danbouck,2010-04-01 00:33:00,4380,Got another 2 tonight about the same size. Lost 3 of them.
450591,Marko,2010-04-01 01:19:00,854," I noticed that you lost quite a few of them over last week or two. Have you tried buying hooks especially made for carp fishing, they are ultra sharp and fish dont get off them that easy."
450594,BillM,2010-04-01 01:21:00,17367,"Dan buddy, you gotta smile more dude  :)"
450671,danbouck,2010-04-01 10:53:00,4380, I am buying some this weekend
