Tried pretty much every depth from 10 FOW to 80+  I was using micro tubes drop shot style...where the heck are those perch?  It was great to be out on the water though.  The boat ran great, and I had a lot of fun with the new Humminbird.  First time using a fish finder and it was pretty amazing to cover spots I was in last year and realize I really had no clue how much water I was fishing in.  I did see a beast of a carp floundering on the surface with something that looked like an eel (heck if I know what it was) clamped onto one of its bottom fins.  Hopefully I'll have a better report the next time out."
451049,bare foot wader,2010-04-02 20:47:00,1354,it was probably a lamprey clamped onto it...
451053,canuckjack,2010-04-02 21:04:00,121," Lamprey eh?  Never heard of em...but I just looked it up and yeah you're right on, that was definitely it.  Nasty little buggers..."

451305,canuckjack,2010-04-03 12:22:00,121," No worries Rock, didn't take it that way at all.  Yeah I'm starting to notice the money adding up, but as long as the Mrs. doesn't we'll be ok   Hey, you're right, it is nice to know I wasn't the only one"
