Not sure yet Anything else?"
451264,Ben_Daniels,2010-04-03 08:08:00,435,Jig rod = 7'6 H or MH rod Crankbait = 7'0 - 7'6 M or MH fiberglass or... M or ML E glass rod with a 5:1 reel Skipping rod = 6 - 6'6 M spinning rod...shorter rods easier to underhand skip with and easier for close up fishing in general.  Thats what I'd want.  -Ben
