451134,skeeter,2010-04-03 00:51:00,1907,"is it just me or is there something wrong with that picture?  first theres ice still out there second - hes in a boat motoring right beside the ice third - he is not wearing a life jacket, with the water temps  one would think he might want to atleast have a slim chance if he hits the ice and rolls the boat over.  just my opinion of course..."
451139,Beans,2010-04-03 01:00:00,3339, Hey Skeeter...you're right you know...he was lucky the ice was there and the OPP wern't...no ice left today...
