450345,4thgen,2010-03-31 13:04:00,157, I wish! I'm not sure if I've been able to top 5lbs up here! The rivers up here are very different from the Lake O ditches that I grew up fishing.

450406,asdve23rveavwa,2010-03-31 16:01:00,2690,LOL...love the new heading!!!!!!!

450524,Ziki,2010-03-31 22:57:00,128," Fishing the states to avoid people... how much did solo pay you to say that? The tribs south of the boarder are brutal when it comes to garbage, snagging and crowds compared to here. The only reason to leave Ontario to fish steelhead is for inexperienced steelheaders who still mark the merit of a fishing day based on the number of fish caught, or hero's."

450534,Sebastian,2010-03-31 23:26:00,208, hahaha I don't fish the states so I wouldn't know. I'm just defending someone who backs me up that the fish is not 20lbs. I don't really care where people fish. Everyone gets something different out of fishing.

450567,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-04-01 00:37:00,0, i agree on all fronts.  having spent the past 8 years working on tribs of the great lakes i have seen a majority of the canadian tribs (and the major US tribs) and there's nowhere dirtier than the canadian side... and i don't think there's a phenomenon like Bronte in Michigan.
450681,canadadude,2010-04-01 12:23:00,769,"Come down and fish some N.Y state Lake Ontario tribs during the chinny run, it's bad much like Bronte, never fished Michigan tribs so can't say  if the tribs are bad.But if there close to large populated cities I'm sure they'll be some what of zoo tactics going on. As for garbage it all depends on the traffic a trib gets, although I will agree the N.Y state and Pensyvania tribs I've visited are well kept."

449973,MJL,2010-03-30 18:30:00,2427,"Congrats on a beauty buck!  Pretty neat thread.   The physiological/biological side of thing is pretty interesting (at least for me)…I’ve been interested in studying all the various strains of steelhead for quite some time.  There are a number of ways of calculating fish weight.  I’ve been doing some of my own research over the years on fish weight and have come up with the realization that the formulas used can be varied depending on the actual genetic strain of the steelhead measured.  For example:  The classic formula:  LxGxG/800 formula  I’ve seen used with salmon and steelhead as well as tuna, mackerel and barracuda.  From what I’ve read, the 800 number was applied to take into account the length and girth associated with dead fish due to shrinkage.  Tom Keelin (An engineer and fly fisherman from BC) came up with the formula specifically for the steelhead of the Babine river in BC (which apparently are even built differently than those from neighbouring rivers like the Kispiox and Bulkley).  His formula is:  LxGxG/690 with 80% accuracy.  With that said, some of the fish from the Babine river are built more like chinnies  I met one angler at the local fly shop who fished the Dean River in B.C (Near Bella Coola) and recommended that I use this chart for my planned trip there (which never did happen   One formula I remember growing up with is to take the length in inches and subtract 20 from it to get how many pounds it was for steelhead.  I found it was OK for fish 22 inches and above out of the the eastern tribs and the Credit (given a deviation of +/- 1-1.5lbs).  With all said and done, you caught a fine specimen and nobody can take away the moment you had catching it.  As blunt as some of the comments were, they were merely opinions and as such, arguing them (or going postal worker on them) is pointless.  If you caught it out of the river I’m thinking of, I’m hoping to get one like that there later this week.  Mike"
449974,Spiel,2010-03-30 18:32:00,9065,"  Nope, he said ""Bye"" and I reciprocated, nothing more.  If he wants to take his ball and go home because those in the know don't agree with the 20lb tag, then so be it.  It would seem that most said ""nice fish"" even if they disputed the 20lb claim and it is indeed a nice fish. Easy to get caught up in the excitement and over estimate it's size when it's your best ever, but as I said, those in the know, know.  No need to get upset if it's not a 20lb, it's still a solid fish and a benchmark for future efforts.  And for the record the lack of an obvious fin clip does not guarantee that it's a wild fish."
449975,ChrisK,2010-03-30 18:37:00,2772,Nice buck Shayne !! He must of put up quite a fight.  Cheers !!
449992,Sebastian,2010-03-30 19:29:00,208," How did I expose my ignorance? With the measurements you posted, the scale says 20 according to this super accurate calculator. With the measurements the 2nd guy posted, it would've been 28. Both very wrong. If you would've posted the fish alone it would've been nice but rookie steelheaders tend to oversize their fish drastically which is why you're being chewed up in this thread and the one on the other board. ITS A NICE FISH SO CONGRATS but put the pipe down and pick up a scale.  Solo has some great pics and fishes the states to avoid steelhead gods like yourself who have been fishing for 3 months and posting black salmon.  Please close this thread. It's honestly a waste of time to let this continue."
449994,Raf,2010-03-30 19:31:00,3495,all this hoopla 'bout a fish that would look better on a quick strike rig.
450008,solopaddler,2010-03-30 20:03:00,8605, Y'know Raf there's a largely unknown esox bite happening in the north channel at the moment. The prey is huge numbers of pen reared escaped rainbows.  I actually have heard of guys rigging the damn things.
450025,bare foot wader,2010-03-30 20:44:00,1354, I've heard of that myself...but it is actually illegal I believe...
450031,solopaddler,2010-03-30 21:02:00,8605, Definitely illegal.  People have a tendency to break the law now and again.
450046,craigdritchie,2010-03-30 21:30:00,1586,'Rumour' has it there's a similar bite on right now much closer to home.

As others have said I think you may need to keep trying for that 20 pounder though.    The one day I forgot my tape measure I get the biggest steelhead that I've caught. We estimated it at around 16lbs but who's to say? It looked like a chinook while I was fighting it in the pool. Another that I caught a few year back on a charter (I know, it doesn't really count) went 16.2lbs and was 35"" I believe."

449675,Sebastian,2010-03-30 00:35:00,208,Not mad. I just find it funny how every big rainbow is 20lbs. It's a solid fish without a doubt but people need to actually weigh steelhead. 15lbs is a SOLID bow.  What's even more funny is that Solo(the only one who knows what a rainbow is) knows it's nowhere near 20lbs. He just has a nicer way to say it.  It's a nice fish but invest in a scale and weigh rainbows. You'll be surprised.
449678,buckster,2010-03-30 00:36:00,530,  comments like this are the reason a lot of people dont post pics or put up reports.......   Nice bow!

449543,Sebastian,2010-03-29 20:21:00,208," Too bad the fish is apparently ""32""length with 22"" girth"" so according to your super accurate calculator the fish is 28.16lbs. You're putting in the numbers reversed and its under 20lbs. Either way that scale is way off. Some Steelheaders catch their fish 12-13lbs fish and automatically its 20lbs. It's a solid fish but nowhere near 20lbs.  Carry a scale and i think you'll be surprised how much your ""20lber"" weighs. Pushing the fish against the camera lens doesn't make it any bigger. Take a legit shot of the fish or pics with the measuring tape next to the fish or simply buy a scale."
