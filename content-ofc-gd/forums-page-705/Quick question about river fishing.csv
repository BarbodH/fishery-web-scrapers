451158,Fisherman,2010-04-03 01:14:00,7201,"All depends on the current, try maybe 4-5 BB splitshot about 4-5 inches apart under the float rather than 1 or 2 big ones.  Watch the others for a couple minutes."
451168,anglerspro,2010-04-03 01:29:00,25," Your weights are not meant to anchor your float in place when float fishing. You need to try to drift your float through the whole length of the pool or run before you reel it in.  It's also important to have your weights set properly, your float set at the right depth and your flourocarbon leader the right length so your float and your bait run effectively through the pool. If you really want to catch fish there's a lot more to it then just throwing in a float , weights and a roe bag and watching it float down stream. If I were you I would watch the other guys fishing first just to get a better understanding or find someone to teach you how to do it effectively.  Good Luck."
