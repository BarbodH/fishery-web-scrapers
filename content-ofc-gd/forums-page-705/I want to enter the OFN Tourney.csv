I am turning 35 and I live in North Bay.  I started fishing when I was 6 and was spoiled by limits of walleye on every trip. I grew up in Kirkland lake but we fished mainly in the matachewan area where my grandfather had a camp.  I fish all year round for any species I can catch in my area. I mainly target walleye but LOVE catching big northerns. I moslty fish Lake Nipissing mainy for convenience. I put my shack on Callander Bay and my boat is in a slip at or trailer park in Sturgeon Falls.  I have 2 boys. One is 7 and the other just turned 1 yesterday.  Biggest fish for me are a 8 pound 11 oz. walleye and a 23 pound Northern.  This year I will try to do a little more back lake fishing with my 4 wheeler and my 9' punt boat.  I hope I can get put on a team and contribute a few nice fish."
