450909,irishfield,2010-04-02 02:49:00,26272,"I heard they were doing it, Jack, so that they could count the number of sunfish left in the lake!!"

450951,cheaptackle,2010-04-02 11:06:00,849,"Ya gotta know that somehow the RLTA and/or their self-proclaimed alleged spokespeoples is behind this rumour!  It doesn't make any sense, sounds like Bull from the git go, is completely ludicrous, bypasses all levels of government, seems completely whimisical and classes itself as an EPIC fail immediately upon presentation.  Yup - just their style!  Michael"
450953,kickingfrog,2010-04-02 11:22:00,8333,We've got to stop this. What's next? The Great Lakes?  I wonder if the water from Rice can be used to top-up another water shed? I vote Nipissing. All of us here on OFC could form a hand bomb line from Rice to Nipissing.  Our motto? One white bucket at a time!
450954,Roy,2010-04-02 11:34:00,13728, I don't think you can mix rice water with regular water.
