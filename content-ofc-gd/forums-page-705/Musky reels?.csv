450437,Marc Thorpe,2010-03-31 17:13:00,621,"I tend go with Lew an Graham on this For longevity and durability,Calcuta CTE 400 is the summit of all reels.  As for speed Curado 300 is quick and so far has stood up to the rigors.  The PME 300 from BPS are quality priced reels with good durability also  I have used most brands in exception of a few,some have good pricing for the cost of the quality ,others have quality in durability for the cost. Like most product,Question you must ask yourself is it quality pricing or quality durability you seek?"
450607,anglerspro,2010-04-01 01:46:00,25,"To answer your question on how I burned out 13 abu 6500 in one season and why I kept using them is simple. As a musky guide I usually have 4 or 5 right hand reels on my boat and 4 or 5 lefty's at at all times.  10 Abu's cost me under $800.00 but 10 Calcutta's would cost me over $3000.00. Thats why I kept using them. Unfortunetly Abu 6500 and records have problems with the thumb release and the anti-reverse gear. Acording to an Abu rep if the gear is not pressed down fully or the reels is jerked while casting the thumb bar can engage part way through a cast stopping the bait instantly. It's like driving down the road at 60km and then putting your car in reverse, it strips gears, and the anti backlash gear strips or breaks in the same way. When you do it enough times it eventualy doesn't work anymore. I also noticed the anti-reverse gear giving out on hook sets which causes very sore knuckles and lost fish.. The abu's also don't stand up to double cowgirls and the gears get worn down and stripped for me in less then a season. I've had old Abu's last 5 years so when I asked Abu if there was a problem with the new reels they simply said ""no, and that they are just not made for muskies and musky lures"". the good thing is the fixed them all under the 1 year warranty.  I also broke 3 Abu records the same season...  Buy the way I still have some Abu 6500 lefty's (fully referbished) for sale if anyone wants some....lol...  Seriously, spend a little extra money and get a reel that will last."
450686,mattyk,2010-04-01 12:42:00,2110,"I have the calcutta 400b, and the TE and and curado and have used for several seasons with no problems. I used my C3 6500 for smaller baits, and when i tried casting a hell hound, the anti-reverse gear went out. So i sent it back and had abu fix it for me. I wont be using the abu any more, and im probably going to sell it and only buy shimano from now on."
450735,fishingisliving,2010-04-01 15:34:00,170,"I used a curado 300 most of the season last year. It saw it's share of double bladed inline spinners (although it was painfull at times) the reel is still in top shape..  checked out all the gears and they look as good as they did when it was out of the box.  I have an abu 6600EXT, I used for a month back in 2008, it's seen all types and sizes of lures, but in a month I fish maybe 4 times so I would think I am not using the reel that much.  The reel already started making a grinding noise out and by the 5th outting.. the gear connecting the main spool to the levelwind was completely shaved of all it's teeth, not a big deal to fix, but annoying. I use it to hold up fishing books in my workshop now.  Going for Calcuttas this year with power handles for comfort. I hope I can catch a fish this year!"

450744,Guest gbfisher,2010-04-01 15:51:00,0,"Buy a Calcutta. It'll save you the time and money in the long run when you're taking other reels in for repairs. Also knowing the a reel will hold when it has to is enough to spend more. What ever you do, do not buy a Shimmano Takota."
450997,houski,2010-04-02 16:46:00,61,"I used a Revo Toro on my bucktail rod last year. Saw lots of double 10 and double 13 blades over the course of the season. I didn't do any maintenance to it whatsoever during the year, and it worked like a top. Took it apart and cleaned and lubiricated it over the winter, and she's ready for another year of work.  Now with that being said, you can never go wrong with a Calcutta, those things are built to put in work."
451037,MuskyGreenHorn,2010-04-02 20:15:00,158,"Weeds brought up the Diawa Saltist during the winter.  I haven't used it but some guides in the states love it.  fast gear ratio for sure.  Liek peopel have mentioned, bigger spools and power hangles make up the difference for gear ratio.  a higher gear ratio means you will give up some torque. Soem guys are tossing big inline bucktaisl using shimano saltwater reels with no levelwind.  Some models bring line in around 40 inches per full crank, talk about super speed.  Get ready for a second morgage though.  I use a 400 TE, a couple of abu 7000i HSN's and a Shimano Tekota.  My Musky Fishing partbner loves his penns, 965 and 975.  I used his 975 quite a bit last year.  Great Reel.  These all pulled lien plenty quick.  He also had record, died pretty quick throwing double 10's.  End of story.  The nice thing about abu's is you can easily get parts for them and it won't cost an arm and a leg.  Check out Mikes Reel Repiar from out west online.  I recommend anyone using abu 7000's to get your hands on the ceramic line pawl the he sells.  This guy sells a lot of stuff to ""pimp"" reels out.  lol"
449575,DANIMAL,2010-03-29 21:21:00,215,"I'm going to be buying a couple new musky reels soon and I'm looking for some ideas on wich to buy.  I've been using Abu Garcia Ambassadeur C4's and I really like the high speed 6.3 gear ratio, but they just ware out too fast. Does anybody here know of any higher quality high speed musky reels."
449581,Roy,2010-03-29 21:39:00,13728,It really depends on your budget. With high speed ratio I assume you don't troll a lot. Still quite a few using C4s but they're really not well rated.  What type of fishing do you do mostly?
449585,uglyfish,2010-03-29 21:50:00,981,"look at a shimano calcutta. lots of sizes and speeds u can pick from, or the curado 300E low profile reel with a big spool and line capacity"
449597,Pigeontroller,2010-03-29 22:09:00,2793,"keep in mind a large spool diametre (including line) ups the retrieve speed, and a power handle also helps."
449601,Roy,2010-03-29 22:20:00,13728,"That's also a good point, Dax."
449609,lew,2010-03-29 22:42:00,12766,"When  casting most baits for muskies  I use 400 series Calcutta CT's & TE's but for burning baits or using jerk or twitch baits where fast line retrieve is neccesary, I like the larger spool reels as suggested by Dax and use  7000 series Abu's.  Their  big reels but bring in line very fast and with the power handles they also work well for cranking the large double bladed Cowgirl type baits with blades up to #13.  The quality in the Abu reels is poor but at only about $150 it doesn't hurt too bad when they fall apart after a year or two."
449658,DANIMAL,2010-03-30 00:07:00,215,"I cast more than troll, but I use seperate low gear ratio line counter reels for trolling. I really like high speed reels for all casting, even hard pulling baits. I'm looking for a high quality reel like a calcutta with at least a 6:1 gear ratio. I'm not to sure if such a thing even exists, but I thought I would ask."
449662,DANIMAL,2010-03-30 00:15:00,215,  I was checking out the shimano website and only the small size calcutta comes in a high gear ratio. The curado you mentioned looks interesting. I'm going to look in to that one.
449689,anglerspro,2010-03-30 00:54:00,25,"After burning out 13 Abu 6500 C3 in 2008 season, I stopped using them completely and staring playing around with a few other reels last season. I used the Shimano Curado 300 all last season and liked it for most lures and another guide I know also used his the last 2 seasons and really liked it. I did find burning larger bucktails with it was tough. I've had a Calcutta for 8 years now and it's still going strong with no service. I've heard some good reviews on the Abu Revo winch if you're looking for a low profile reel with some power.  Best over-all casting reel in my opinion is the Calcutta.  Good luck,"
449711,NANUK,2010-03-30 01:32:00,797,Team Daiwa Luna 300 is an awesome musky reel IMO
449712,Raf,2010-03-30 01:37:00,3495,"abu 7001s for the big stuff, quantum cabo for small stuff and jerkbaits is what I've been (ab)using last few seasons."
449736,Weeds,2010-03-30 02:19:00,782, I've got to ask; how did you burn out 13 C3's in a season? And why would you go through 13 of them before switching? 13 Abu's in one season but 8 seasons of use from the Calcutta. That cannot be typical. I can't imagine the reels were being used in a similar fashion.
449740,FisherMike,2010-03-30 02:29:00,108,"im also extremely curious as to how you burned out 13 reels in one season.  as for me, ive use the curado 301 and have no complaints."
449746,BillM,2010-03-30 02:44:00,17367, Guiding in GBay tends to do that to equipment me thinks..
449789,Weeds,2010-03-30 09:41:00,782, Apparently not; so long as it's Shimano.
450051,muskymatt,2010-03-30 21:37:00,2608,Curados are really nice...Calcuttas are nice too...abu's are disposable and who wants to burn $150 a year on a reel??  Spend the money and quality and longevity will speak for themselves!!
450053,DANIMAL,2010-03-30 21:44:00,215,Thanks everyone for all the replies. I think I'm going to buy a calcutta and see how I like it.
450055,craigdritchie,2010-03-30 21:49:00,1586,Never had a problem with my old (pre-TE) Calcutta 400s.
450056,bare foot wader,2010-03-30 21:50:00,1354,"you'll definitely love the calcutta, esp if you get the TE....  same convo goin on at the fishon board....my big thing with the c4's is that their thumb bars suck...plastic and very flexible...when trolling a big bait i'd have to pull some slack in my line befoer i could depress the thumb bar, ie if i wanted to let a few more feet out....I personally like the push button release on the abu's"
450125,Raf,2010-03-30 23:44:00,3495,"a 6500 c4 is a bass reel, 6500 c3s are ok for reasonable use.  but don't expect them to last with the double 10 rage."
450140,Rizzo,2010-03-31 00:08:00,4754,"I've burned out a 6500, Shimano Corsair, couple of Pete Maina BPS specials, and am now working on destroying an Ambassadeur Record...if it fails me too (it did survive last season) I may have to look at some of these more costly options"
450370,bigbuck,2010-03-31 14:07:00,2449,Abu Records are decent reels. My 2 go to reels are my Record 60 and my Calcutta 400TE. I use my Curado 300E for the smaller bucktails. The big 7000i Abu is for trolling and chucking the big Cowgirls.
450374,Aaron Shirley,2010-03-31 14:31:00,655,The new Canadian Rapala aluminum Andros reel is nice. It's a round reel that comes in a 400 size for musky. Not sure off hand what the gear ratio is.
450387,Raf,2010-03-31 15:08:00,3495,I was waiting for the Rapala reply.
450410,bdox,2010-03-31 16:07:00,329,"Why not try the new Abu Revo Toro? Comes in both 50 and 60 sizes as well as low and high speed versions for each size. It Comes with a power handle as an accessory. I don't fish musky but I've put it up against a couple big cats this year and it has been a pleasure. It casts really well, especially given it has a synchronized level-wind. An added plus is when you're done casting and want to troll, it has a line-out alarm. I got mine off the auction site for just over $200 to my door."
