450923,stan_133,2010-04-02 03:29:00,77,just looking to pick up some tips for trolling out of port credit for trout or salmon. i went out today for a few hours and started at 30 ft and finished at 90ft before calling it a day. i have no idea what depths i should focus on this time of year at all. any help would be great.
