450516,carp-starter,2010-03-31 22:39:00,253,Just stopped at the Pioneer gas station on Lakeshore and Bronte in Oakville - their air is FREE.  carp-starter  IndySKS - oops I forgot that one - lol

450520,Ziki,2010-03-31 22:45:00,128," Still trying to wrap your head around the whole ""self-serve"" thing eh..? what happened to ""get your lazy ass out of your car and fill up your own gas tank"" now that's a self sufficient society."
450523,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-03-31 22:57:00,0,they'd sell ya the rope to hang yourself if they could make a buck.
450525,POLLIWOGG,2010-03-31 23:00:00,835,"There was a Gas bar somewhere on my run to Fort Mac back in 80-81 that had a huge map next to the till with a ""you are here"" and if you looked at it they added a $1 to your bill and not tell you. Found it doing my taxes. Probably good for a couple hundred a day."
450530,ColdH20guy,2010-03-31 23:17:00,312, yes the joys of small town living eh Bill! lol ( you ever consider Barrie Bassmasters?)
450537,jedimaster,2010-03-31 23:28:00,3472,Funny thing is I remember going to a gas station to pump up my bicycle tire once and the gas attendant came out and told be to stop wasting his electricity its for paying customers.
450541,misfish,2010-03-31 23:37:00,29133,"To the guy that noted that he buys his cigs,pop and what ever,I can see your point.  NOW  As Im the one that takes care of 4 compressors in both plants.They sevice ,punch presses,shakers for scrap removal and blow offs to get the parts away from the dies,welders  also require air.AIR COSTS, much more then you think.  Break down for you.This is not your garage air compressor I understand,but to show you that air is not free.  1 air filter = $65  1 oil filter =$35  5 gal pail of tonna 68 = $85.  Oil seperator = $250  Also add the cost of hydro.  Manual labour to do the job = 4-5 hrs.(no Im not going to put a dollar figure here)  This work is done, on all four machines twice a year.One compressor has it done three times a year,as it runs 24/6.  AIR IS NOT FREE."
450571,Twocoda,2010-04-01 00:50:00,4130, she may not talk back to you but she cant keep her mouth shut to anyone that sees her
450574,Daplumma,2010-04-01 00:59:00,1961,Too funny Tinman.I remember more than one of my HVAC guys topping off his tires with R-22 back in the 80's.They would hang you and your family for that now.The same guys also never had a schrader valve in their spare..Wonder where that went?Nitrogen???We purged with the good stuff back then. Joe
450582,ch312,2010-04-01 01:08:00,1590,just go inside and ask the cashier to turn it on for you. most are willing to give you the air for free...
450613,Rattletrap2,2010-04-01 02:00:00,1652,"Tinman and Daplumma, Do you ever notice that filling car tires with nitrogen is all the rage these days? They charge large for it too! We have been doing it for years! When I was fresh out of high school, I worked at De Havilland Aircraft in Downsview. They always filled the aircraft tires with nitrogen because it does not expand or contract with a change in temperature. Well, there were some guys that were in the habit of also ""borrowing"" some good grease that they used on the wheel bearings, and taking it home to grease their car wheel bearings. Problem was, the grease for aircraft was only expected to do a good job for a very short time period while taking off or landing. Cars on the other hand, would travel hundreds of miles at a time. The grease would break down under those conditions and their vehicles were screwed. We always got a chuckle out of them!  This thread reminded me of those days!"
450712,skeeter,2010-04-01 14:44:00,1907,"  AIR IS FREE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  the means in which you aquire the air might not be, but the air is FREE..... the cost depends on you. 12 volt air compressors that plug into a cigarette lighter are cheap, and work great. you can get them for around $10. there compact and can sit in your trunk for years. my 2002 montana has a built in compressor for the air ride suspension and it has a long hose with a gauge to fill tires and anything else i might need it for. ( i love that thing) i also carry a ctc $10 special in the back aswell. along with a lot of other just incase stuff.  TRACKER use laugh at all the stuff i carry, but he is finding out why !!!LOL like a new tube that fits my trailer tires- remember that road side repair tracker--lol the no glue tire plugs that work GREAT when a nail tags along... and the list continues............................................"
450798,GBW,2010-04-01 18:47:00,8460,"Only $15?  Try going to a Leafs game, HAHAHAHA.  Your sore all over after that..."
450990,Tinman,2010-04-02 16:33:00,376,"  Yep, its all the rage, i used it when i had a flat the other day, the tire goes up pretty fast! and then to pump up the kids tires. I had heard of them using r22 to pump up tires but heard that was temporary cause they could blow lol."
450417,ColdH20guy,2010-03-31 16:33:00,312,"so I dig out my mountain bike from the back of the shed....as expected the tires are a bit low so I bike down the street to the gas station air pump...pull up and new sticker on there now..$1 for air....what the hell? What happened to the good ol days when it was free...then it went to .50 cents..never thought we would be paying for air...brutal Needless to say, I biked home with the tires still a bit low..."
450421,kickingfrog,2010-03-31 16:38:00,8333,I hear ya. Once they figured what we would pay for water you had to know air was next.
450424,Roy,2010-03-31 16:48:00,13728," To be fair, you should be refunded with a value added bonus for a fart."
450426,Dara,2010-03-31 16:53:00,3052,"So you want to use their $5,000.00 compressor for free?  And when somebody cuts the hose they should fix it so you can get free air?  Maybe just put your lips down to that nozzle and blow.  "
450433,ColdH20guy,2010-03-31 17:07:00,312, easy does it! wow.....I was only making a general comment and you go and blow it out of proportion..must be the air up there where you are..cant even make a comment on here anymore...
450434,Roy,2010-03-31 17:12:00,13728, Yes you can...you just need to use your selective answer reading skills.
450436,davis,2010-03-31 17:13:00,128,"used to be that they would at least donate the money to charity (or at least say they would) the air pumps at PCanada cost $1, but sticker also says you can ask for complimentary air from the attendant - which is what I always do without any problems."
450438,blaque,2010-03-31 17:13:00,2419,"lol,.....the concept does sound funny. But the service is there for your convenience and the money is invested to get it to you so yeah........theres gotta be a charge. $1.00, well, i dunno bout that. I dont use the service much but it used to be .25 cents. Ive noticed .75 now. But not a buck.  Anyway, this is why i asked for a little black and decker air station for x-mas a while back. Only use the gas station air in emergencies.  You think air is bad.......it doesnt get half the rise outta me as a $15.00 parking spot to watch a hockey game."
450439,ColdH20guy,2010-03-31 17:18:00,312, thats what the subway is for! lol
450440,alphaalpha,2010-03-31 17:19:00,475, Last year when i had a slow leak on a tire and only had to top it up when i got fuel i quickly learned that all Shell stations have the free compressor.  It was a matter of convience to not always have to have quarters on me when i fill up like at other stations.  I still try to only use shell just out of the loyalty that i feel from those days.  the bonus airmiles they give don't hurt either
450444,Abraxus,2010-03-31 17:23:00,104,"  Okay! I have to comment on this statement!  Yes, I actually do expect the air to be free!  I buy gas, ciggarettes, pop, coffe and an assortment of other items from your freaking store, so the least you can do in order to express some resmeblance of customer service and appreciation, would be provide a working FREE air compressor for my tires!  Personally I think it is this ""me first"" and ""only if I get paid for it will I do it"" attitude that is ruining our society  Remember those days when a business owner would actually appreciate your hard earned dollar?  You know... when you would go to a service station (They should now be called no service stations) and there would be a person waiting at the pump, ready to fill your tank, clean your windows and top up the oil and tires for you?  Society seemed so much nicer then!  Now we have jack asses that speak to you through a speaker on the wall telling you to pre pay or fill!  It seems as though there just isnt any appreciation for our business or buck any more.   It really is a disturbing trend.  (This was not directed at you Dara, as I am sure you were being sarcastic.)  AB"
450448,ColdH20guy,2010-03-31 17:33:00,312, exactly what he said!!
450449,Mattitude,2010-03-31 17:39:00,155,Charging for air now?  Probably just inflation.
450450,TJQ,2010-03-31 17:42:00,7806," hahahahahahaha... nice...  Up here, its impossible to find a station with a compressor... Ive had my own little one at home for a while now..."
450454,Dara,2010-03-31 18:00:00,3052,"  please notice the little whistling emote. If they had a guy stirring a pot, I would have used that one.  The Husky here still has free air, some places are a buck...but at least its clean air"
450457,Terry,2010-03-31 18:25:00,14456,at that price it had better be dijon air  or naked cuties had better pump it for you   the tire that is
450459,carp-starter,2010-03-31 18:27:00,253,"Get an air compressor from Canadian Tire and keep it in your car. These are cheap and they are small.  They will inflate footballs, soccer balls and similar balls.  They will inflate an air mattress when you go camping.  They will inflate bike-cycle tires.  And of course they will also inflate car tires.  carp-starter"
450466,ketchenany,2010-03-31 18:35:00,3229,Problem solved

450472,Tinman,2010-03-31 19:10:00,376,The nitrogen tank in my truck has already come in handy twice lol and not just for air conditioners
450476,DanD,2010-03-31 19:42:00,2223,"Here’s the other side of this free air from someone that use to run a gas station. A few years back I was a Sunoco dealer, here in London; at a station that had service bays (almost a thing of the past) and it was the dealer’s responsibility to look after the free air meter. The thing cost me any where from 600-1000 bucks a year to maintain. People would beat the living crap out of it; trying to stretch a 25 foot hose to 30, throwing the nozzle/gage on the ground; just to run over it as they left. I found the meter lying on the ground one morning; after somebody ripped it out of the wall? Sunoco at the time wouldn’t let me put a coin-op in; when it came time for me to renew my contract; I insisted they take over the air meter’s maintenance; which they did; the next year the coin-op went in. It’s the people that abused things that screw it for everyone else; in this case, it doesn’t have anything to do with customer service. Actually the places that still have the coin-ops are doing their customer a service, by even having one. Because people still beat the crap out of them; as if it’s the fault of the machine, their tires went flat. Most of these coin-ops are not owned by the service station; but by companies like Airserv. The station supplies the hydro to run it and whatever company would look after the machine and the monies that came out of it. Never could get a strait answer out of the guy that serviced the machine; as to how the money was distributed to whatever charity they claimed to support? All I ever got from him was a smile, as he cleaned the money out of it? Now after saying all that; I’ve moved away from Sunoco and I have a free air line set outside my service bay door, for anyone to use; but I watch it like a hawk and it comes in at night when I leave. LOL  Dan."
450486,BucktownAngler,2010-03-31 20:22:00,582,FYI....Shell gas station has free air.
450487,bare foot wader,2010-03-31 20:40:00,1354,"I can understand both sides of the story here....but regardless of cost, i'll gladly pay for it in a jam, is every gas station should have a pump.....I actually had an emergency and was stranded at a station that didn't have a pump...had to wait an hour until finally somebody pulled in and had a pump in his truck...."
450493,ColdH20guy,2010-03-31 21:07:00,312, not where I went! Great insight Dan..thanks for the story....
450494,DanD,2010-03-31 21:10:00,2223,I agree that gas stations or garages should have some form of air supply for their customers use; coin-op or not. Plus for me as a garage owner; it gives me a sales opportunity; when I go out a talk with the people. You know that tire youre filling every other day; I can likely fix that for you. LOL Now Im going to date myself here; but I can remember helping kids with their bike tires at the air pump; now that theyre grown up; Im fixing their cars and helping their kids. LOL  Dan.
