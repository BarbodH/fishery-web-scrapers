445021,Tom McCutcheon,2010-03-18 15:44:00,627,Just a guess Daryl on age; depending on the forage base for a 40 inch Muskie you are looking at between 10 and 15 years old. I can't do better than that without scale samples for the MNR.  Tom.
445068,BillM,2010-03-18 17:30:00,17367,"  Doug, let me know if you need any company.  I'm always up for a pike slay."

445169,Jigger,2010-03-18 22:45:00,1237,"^^^ this.  Also, just like people making excuses fishing bass out of season, I can also see some of the more unscrupulous anglers pulling musky under the pretense of ""spring pike fishing"". I've seen it in the past.  Doesn't bode well..."
445289,pokerdemon4,2010-03-19 03:19:00,135,Where is a good place to launch on Balsam early in the year?
446068,dada2727,2010-03-21 23:53:00,108,heres the pic of the hybrid my brother caught in mitchel last summer.  Pike have been in mitchel and balsam long enough for this thing to get that big. 
446083,Andy,2010-03-22 00:21:00,330, Beauty! Where do tigers fit into the regs re; poss'n limits? Or are they not covered at all?
446093,Weeds,2010-03-22 00:30:00,782, Agreed.
446101,Ron,2010-03-22 00:35:00,1683, Tigers are regarded as a Muskie in the fishing regulations.
446126,mattyk,2010-03-22 01:11:00,2110,Really nice looking tiger!
446129,mbac31,2010-03-22 01:13:00,904,Do not keep a Tiger. They are under the Muskie regs. Pike in Balsam will be in those big shallow bays adjacent to deeper water. West Bay and South bay and North Bay around those Stumps and weed flats. Remember not to run up the Canal in Balsam to Mitchell. There is a steel beam of sorts put there by the Ministry or someone. Maybe the trent guys. You will destroy your boat. I think its there to stop logs and trees from floating into the lake. If you launch into Mitchell lake you will find tons of Pike there for sure. They usually spawn there first and the bigger ones tend to hang out there.
446342,hirk,2010-03-22 15:27:00,571,"One problem sure to be seen will be guys ""fishing pike"" on water where they don't exist (as in most of the lakes posted here earlier)a hard ass CO might lay a charge of targeting a species during closed season and yeah the guy(s) fishing may have made an honest mistake fishing pike on say Chemong or Rice but ignorance of the law is not a legal defence,a few charges laid may put the brakes on too much of that going on."
446413,Great Lake Steel,2010-03-22 17:15:00,41,Has anyone been catching Pike in Pigeon?  I'll be out perching in a week or two and I'm curious.
446455,hirk,2010-03-22 18:32:00,571,There are no pike in Pidgeon
446578,Matt15,2010-03-22 22:44:00,107, Lake Dalyrmpal is also in zone 17 and has a lot of pike in it.
446616,fish-miester,2010-03-22 23:46:00,864,I'll Personaly be on Canal and Dalryrmpal when ice is out.. but as for scugog having pike.. i doubt it.. tho i heard in the past two years two people I know have seen a tiger musky in scugog.. so who knows.
446646,mistaredone,2010-03-23 00:21:00,913,I'd be happy to cull some pike from Canal and Mitchell.  Ive never fished Kawarthas so early.  Any guess how much longer till ice out?  Looking forward to some pike reports.
446885,Jer,2010-03-23 12:06:00,1426,"   ...methinks it won't be two long, one or two weeks at most."
446887,Jer,2010-03-23 12:08:00,1426,   Perching?  The crappie should be in thick at ice-out.

I saw in a book that the best chances of catching a trophy pike is during ice out. And what lake would you think would have the biggest pike in it ? Good luck to all the pike hunters."

444348,bassman,2010-03-16 13:27:00,384,I didn't realize there were pike in Scugog. Can you confirm? Any photos?
444350,ehg,2010-03-16 13:29:00,2666," Only Canal has many pike, may be some in Balsam. The rest have musky not to be targeted."
444354,Harrison,2010-03-16 13:45:00,2202," I have never seen nor heard of pike in Buckhorn, Chemong, Rice, Sturgeon, Pigeon or Scugog.  However Balsam, Mitchell and Canal lakes have them.  As mentioned above Crowe is loaded too, to bad as it used to be an awesome Muskie lake, including a good tiger population.  I am afraid soon enough they'll spread to the rest of the Kawarthas."
444386,fish-miester,2010-03-16 16:25:00,864,"  agreed. no pike in there.. only lakes are as stated above .. Canal , Mitchel, some in Balsom but one day .. we might unforchanetly see them spread through the rest"
444389,Minnow,2010-03-16 16:29:00,177," If you are implying that the ""pike"" I caught were musky, I can assure you they were 100% pike, I know scugog and sturgeon are musky lakes but these 2 pike I caught in each lake were incidental catches during walleye openers. I hate catching pike in these musky lakes since I know how a pike population can over take a musky population and to know some pike have already reached these lakes really worries me.  Anyways Thanks for all the tips guys!"
444390,Lunkerhunter,2010-03-16 16:30:00,455," ummm im pretty certain those were muskie, well im positive on scugog anyway..... you have any pics of these so called ""pike""  EDIT - just saw your comments that you posted at the same time as me, where on scugog did you catch them?? i would love to see some pics of the pike caught on scugog"
444419,Tom McCutcheon,2010-03-16 18:01:00,627,Minnow; Thanks for posting; I am with Muskies Canada and would be very interested in confirmation of Pike either caught or sighted in any of the Kawartha Lakes. We are currently working with the OMNR to precisely identify lakes where the Pike have managed to invade the system. Up to now we have only been able to comfirm that they are in as far as Balsam. Please PM me with pictures if you have them and the locations where they were caught. (location does not have to be exact GPS coordinates but that would help) along with time of year.  Thanks Tom McCutcheon Release Director Kawartha Lakes Chapter Muskies Canada Inc.
444510,steverowbotham,2010-03-16 23:52:00,1800,"Yeah I have definitely never seen or heard of a pike out of Scugog.  Would be very interested to get some confirmation on that.  Canal is loaded with them, Balsam now has a fishable amount as well as Mitchell."
444512,mbac31,2010-03-16 23:57:00,904,"There ar Pike in Sturgeon, Cameron,Rice and Scugog. There are several guys on here that wil tell you where they are maybe. I have steered some guys in the direction of them. Balsam, cameron and Mitchell,Canal are full of them right now. Remember the pictures I posted last year. Research it. I have personally caught 3 from Sturgeon,1 in Scugog and have seen one in Rice caught. I meerley posted that these lakes are open for pike, read the regs. Thay are open all year now and you are free to search for them. I for one will be out there looking for them as soon as the ice is gone. Dont be so niave, if the Pike are in the top lake like Balsam why would they not swim down. Where do you think the tiger Muskie on Sturgeon come from. The Tiger stork"
444513,mbac31,2010-03-17 00:00:00,904,Tomfoolery. Call or email me. I will give you all the info and any pictures that you need also other anglers that have caught them. I even have exact locations where they were caught.
444522,Tom McCutcheon,2010-03-17 00:58:00,627,  PM sent Thanks.
444548,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-03-17 02:06:00,0,"I'm pretty sure minnow knows the difference between a pike and a Musky.  But I think they should close pike fishing until may 14 also in the Kawarthas. Anyone fishing for pike will be catching mostly everything but pike. Unless you are fishing Canal lake, or Crowe."
444553,Minnow,2010-03-17 02:19:00,177," Hey,  I caught one in Sturgeon near Goosebay on a weed edge during mid May right after opener. The fish in Scugog was caught off of my friends boat in July and not really sure on the location as I am not really familiar with the lake, but pretty sure it was the norhtern part of scugog. Both pike were hammer handles not bigger then 25"". I obviously did not take pictures of the fish as they were hammer handles and I can say 100% that they were pike, since I catch muskie all the time on sturgeon and other lakes and was shocked to see pike had already made it down. I hope they do not take over like they did in other lakes such as Elephant which I fish often, this lake use to be muskie exclusive lake and is now over run with hammerhandle pike."
444555,Minnow,2010-03-17 02:24:00,177," Thanks Johnny Bass  I completely agree on the opening pike all year, since most of the kawartha lakes are filled with walleye, bass, and muskie and that is what you will be catching while targeting pike. I don't think the season should be open on these lakes where you might catch one incidental pike once every season.  That is why I asked if anyone knows any predominantly pike lakes like Canal, and Crowe that I can get the boat out for some early action. Thanks for the tips guys and see you on the water!"
444556,BillM,2010-03-17 02:25:00,17367,Sounds like Canal lake would be a good bet for some ice out pike.
444590,musky66,2010-03-17 05:25:00,273,"Seems a decent ( or indecent) number of Pike in Balsam now- although I'm sure they didn't arrive overnight. I will be out as early as possible to target them, and trying to avoid Musky of course- but it is almost inevitable that there will be incidental Musky caught. I have contacted the MNR regarding this issue and this is what I received.  As of January 1, you and your friends will be able to fish pike year round. Currently, our office is working closely with the local chapter of Muskies Canada to do some investigations into the interaction between pike and muskie. At this point, we don't have a handle on the specific spawning periods (spawning pike populations are only becoming established on Balsam), but pike typically spawn very shortly after ice-out.  Under a sport fishing licence, you can harvest six pike. Please note it is an offence to allow the flesh of these fish to spoil, so there is an expectation that the fillets of any harvested pike would be used.  Not as a matter of law, but as a best practice - I would encourage you to leave areas if you encounter muskies (either visually or through incidental catch). It's obviously important to minimize stress on the fish prior to or during their spawning period.  I would appreciate if you could share any observations with me following your outing. I'd also encourage you to contact the local Muskies Canada chapter for more information on this project, although we are still working out a schedule for this year. You can contact Jeremiah Wade ([email protected]) for more information.  This was provided by Dan Tallion in regards to a possible spring Pike derby on Balsam. The MNR it seems is encouraging the harvest of Pike to slow the advance of them through the kawarthas. I will do my part. My friends and I removed and consumed 6 good sized Pike last season alone, and there have been web reports of many more being caught."
444661,Skud,2010-03-17 14:37:00,739,I will be making a few trips to Balsam in April to catch some pesky pike. I would imagine fishing in two to five feet of water with spinnerbaits will not catch anything but pike in the first weeks of April. Remember to keep the big spawning momma's for your limit.
444663,Tom McCutcheon,2010-03-17 14:53:00,627,well put skud;  keep your baits small and if you do catch a Muskie please release it without pictures boatside and move out of the area. One of the easiest ways to tell a Muskie from a pike is by the Pores on the underside of the jaw. A pike will have 4 to 6 down each side of the lower jaw whereas a Muskie can have as many as 7 to 10 pores on each side. A Hybrid Muskie will be similar to the Pike and more difficult to tell apart. Good luck.... Thanks fellows and be safe out on the cold wet water....  Tom.
444668,scugpg,2010-03-17 15:10:00,1373, Had no clue there are Northern's in some of those lakes...wow. Nothing wrong with pike for a meal though once you learn how to clean them.
444673,Harrison,2010-03-17 15:24:00,2202," Hey bud, you'll get into some bass too.  Especially when the sun's high and along the north/west shores.  Get those snot rockets outta Balsam!"
