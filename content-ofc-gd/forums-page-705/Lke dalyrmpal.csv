450521,Matt15,2010-03-31 22:51:00,107,  Yeah I was because the camp grounds arent open yet. I just hope that the water levels aren't to low over there.
450531,Rizzo,2010-03-31 23:20:00,4754,when is the season open? I always thought pike closed for April
450542,Matt15,2010-03-31 23:38:00,107,  Yea usually it is but lake dalyrmpal is in zone 17 and the yhave pike open all year around.
450557,gone_fishin,2010-04-01 00:12:00,481,i was up there on monday for a drive... still lots of ice on the lake... the narrows are ice free though... hope that helps.
450614,Matt15,2010-04-01 02:08:00,107,"   Thnaks gone_fishin, Its good to know that the narrows are ice free. I still might give it a shot on friday and hopefully the warm weather this week opened up the lake abit more to get a bit of fishing in"
450619,T Fisher,2010-04-01 02:36:00,139,Thanks gone_ fishin. If your up that way again please let me know of the ice conditions. It's a 2 hour drive for me. You could save me a trip.
