I have a Canoe that I might need to trade in because of physical limitations (lifting) and a used 12 or 14 footer on a trailer will not be a problem. Rob"
451079,skeeter,2010-04-02 23:12:00,1907,if your looking for a 12-14 footer check on line at kijiji. i bought mine from a guy on there and it was a great deal.
451091,irishfield,2010-04-02 23:35:00,26272,There is a 14'r and 9.9 Johnson here in the classifieds for $1000!. You'll need a trailer though.
451094,SBCregal,2010-04-02 23:39:00,688,last time i was on kijiji there were plenty of boat/motor/trailer in the 12-14 range for ~1000 bucks
451111,spincast,2010-04-03 00:14:00,3279,theres a ft tinny for sale on the Paris / Cambridge Rd just outside Paris - or at least it was there when I went by on Thusday on the way home. Kijijji has lots ( I just somd my 12 ft there). CAS marina had a few but no motore with it in that price range.
