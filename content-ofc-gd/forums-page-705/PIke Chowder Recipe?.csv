I've heard people talk about making pike chowder, and that sounds good so I'd like to try it.  Has anyone made a chowder (or a bouillabaisse) with pike before that was good?  And if so, would you care to share the recipe?  Many thanks!"

450841,lhousesoccer,2010-04-01 22:01:00,442,"Yeah, of course Google will give me thousands of hits.  I was hoping someone could personally recommend one of their own recipes that they use and know it's good.  Google won't sort the recipe hits by ""awesome"" through ""wouldn't feed it to my cattle"""

And this one that I stole and morphed from Big Cliff,just use fish insted of scallops and shrimp. Seafood Chowder   2 Leeks chopped 2 bunches scallions chopped 1 lb bacon 8 cups chicken broth 5 heads of garlic 3 shallots 1 cup of flour 32 oz(one big bag)frozen corn. 4 14 oz cans of diced potatoes. Drained 1lb cooked cocktail shrimp 1 lb scallops 2 sweet bell peppers chopped 1 cup fat free ½ & ½  Roast garlic and shallots at 350 together for 1 hour. Cook bacon until crispy. Take 3 tablespoons of grease and put in large stock pot. Chop bacon and reserve. Add leeks and scallions and cook over medium heat until soft and coated with bacon fat. Add flour and cook additional 4 minutes,scraping bottom of pot to keep flour from burning. Add 4 cups of chicken broth,slowly at first to keep flour from clumping. Press  each clove of garlic by squeezing cloves between thumb and forefinger. I wear rubber gloves. Do the same to the shallots. Add Garlic and shallots to pot. Bring to boil and simmer for 30 minutes. Allow to cool for a few minutes and puree with food processes or blender. Add rest of chicken broth and peppers and bring to boil.Simmer 30 minutes until peppers are soft Saute scallops in butter or bacon fat and add to pot. Add shrimp,corn,potatoes and peppers. Cook until corn and potatoes are cooked. Turn down heat and  add ½ and ½. Serve in a warm bowl with bacon sprinkled on top. A splash of sherry is also good.   Cheers Joe"
