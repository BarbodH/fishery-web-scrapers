451061,archer379,2010-04-02 21:50:00,277,i was given a prop today and was told it would work but the numbers don't match. i have a 99 Johnson 70 horse the prop i have on the boat is stamped 13x19. the one i got today is 13.5 x17. What are the difference between the 2 and will it work  thanks
451065,irishfield,2010-04-02 21:58:00,26272,"The one you got today is 13.5 inch pitch (theoretically how far forward it would go if you turned it one revolution in a hunk of butter) x 17""  diameter.. the one you have is 13 pitch x 19 inch diameter. Put it on and see how it works. I was surprised this summer when Leah smacked a prop.. that a different pitch/diameter combo runs much better on the steel boat than what we had. The marina had two in stock to try.. and the odd ball worked better."
451075,Fisherman,2010-04-02 22:48:00,7201,And here I always thought the first number was the diameter or...

451078,skeeter,2010-04-02 23:10:00,1907,IRISHFIELD IS WRONG?????????????? Whats up wit dat???   lol im marking this one on the calender  actually i had the deer in the headlight look when i read that to. i am in belief that the last number is the inches it should move the boat. make sure you check the clearance of the new prop when you put it on .
451178,NANUK,2010-04-03 01:45:00,797," Your old prop was 13"" dia x 19 degree pitch, the new prop is 13.5"" dia x 17 degree pitch, as a rule of thumb, for every one degree of less pich you will gain approx 200 RPM, with the new set up you'll probably gain 200/300 RPM (because the new prop has 1/2"" larger diameter). important thing to remember is NOT to acceed recommened engine RPM at WOT,"
451282,archer379,2010-04-03 10:43:00,277, thanks everyone for there answers. I will try it on the boat in morning then will have to wait a few more weeks until i can get into the water. | guess i better try and fix the tach in the boat lol. I did a quick search last night on the web and was surprized how little info there seemed to be on the subjuct of which prop would work best.
