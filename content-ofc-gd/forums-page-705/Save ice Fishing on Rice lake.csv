450618,Michael_Brown,2010-04-01 02:35:00,411,It would seem that Susan Irving-Coger is unable to create her own ideas and has copied the one by Chessy.  I was forwarded the link to their survey.  If you disagree with ice fishing and would like to see overharvest of the sunfish resource on Rice Lake feel free to sign theirs.  http://www.petitiononline.com/mod_perl/signed.cgi?4233474   I think I will rent a giant billboard in Bewdley with my picture on it standing on the ice of Rice Lake holding a 8 inch bluegill.
450695,chessy,2010-04-01 13:24:00,610,what really kills me micheal is that you can not see who is signing the petition . she has blocked that option . but what really suprises me is the number of guys on this board and she is kicking my butt with names.. no wonder we loose most of the times
449904,chessy,2010-03-30 15:54:00,610,Hi guys not to good at doing these things but i have dont a online petition that i will give to the mayor of port hope to help fight for the saving of rice lake ice fishing .. dont know how good these things work but it it worth a try.  http://www.petitiononline.com/ricelake/petition.html

450011,Ron,2010-03-30 20:14:00,1683,"Thanks for this Chessy. Hope this makes a difference. To the best of my knowledge, the Counties and Municipalities are starting to get feedback from anglers. We have to let them know we have a voice also.    Hey Wayne, at this point I have sent emails to the members of the Tourist Ass. and have not received one reply from any of the members, not even a reply from the President of the Ass. as well."
450039,Jer,2010-03-30 21:15:00,1426,"I know of at least one RLTA member that actually catered to a group of American ice-fishermen this winter...can you imagine? I wonder if they told Susan?  The point being, I don't really think we should paint the whole association with the same brush. Unfortunately, the squeaky wheel gets the grease..."
450059,irishfield,2010-03-30 21:56:00,26272," Dang.. they must be afraid that Susan will run around in cirles in front of their resorts, with her uncorked transom exhaust, and annoy their guests. I wonder if she knows thru hulls over 90db are illegal within 5 miles of shore..."

450100,irishfield,2010-03-30 22:57:00,26272,"Don't let your guard down. The only reason Temagami had a one month Winter lake trout season for the last decade +(and now all of Zone 11), is that the Temagami Lakes Association cried that there wasn't any fish left when they came to their cottages for a couple weeks in the summer due to all the winter angling pressure. Their inability to find fish = must be no fish left and the MNR gave them the restrictions to appease."

450103,Sinker,2010-03-30 23:01:00,8692,"I signed it for what its worth.  Do you really think the RLTA will put a stop to icefishing, and change the panfish limits???? I think its totally laughable myself.  We have so much info/research/science to back us anglers, the MNR will just laugh at the proposal.  We've got the highest limits on bluegills in N.A. I have a hard time believing the MNR is going to change it.  The RLTA is going to need some serious proof before anything changes, and it will take them years to get it. The new regs will be in place for long enough to see what actually comes of them, before anything will change, at the very least.      S."

450240,Michael_Brown,2010-03-31 02:33:00,411,"For your information before your meeting with the Mayor.  Two petitions containing hundreds of signatures supporting the issues of ice fishing and reasonable panfish limits were submitted to the MNR during the consulation process.  I would also mention the number of views on this topic on various ontario fishing related websites is approx. 20,000.  It might be in the interests of Northumberland county and the Mayor to review and research this issue before upsetting tens of thousands of anglers in their voting area."
450358,chessy,2010-03-31 13:26:00,610, thanks MICHAEL  i will inform her . she is a hunter and a fishermen but the last time something like this came to her vote people let her down by not showing up to tell there point of view and others did and she had to vote with what her voting members asked for

450394,Dara,2010-03-31 15:17:00,3052,I think it was a mistake opening an ice fishing season and it should be closed.  The limit on sunfish should be about 30  JMO
