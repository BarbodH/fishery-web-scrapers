54976,jjcanoe,2007-04-03 22:59:00,744,Anyone know where I might be able to get a steering cable fixed in southwestern Ontario?  I live in London so preferably around here but I also head down around Ridgetown/Chatham and Hamilton/Niagara a lot so those would also be options.  Thanks  jjcanoe

55087,Guest lundboy,2007-04-04 04:11:00,0,Not sure if they do repairs...  but the Johnson Outdoors H.O. is in Burlington near Burloak... little closer to you.
55088,taper,2007-04-04 04:15:00,611,If you can do the repairs yourself Rockies bait in Orillia (I think thats the name) is great to deal with and he will ship the parts.

55209,mart,2007-04-04 14:05:00,93,Go with Rockey. I ordered a new foot pedal last year from him. Great guy and great customer service. I had my new part the next day.
55226,taper,2007-04-04 14:43:00,611,Thanks for the edit on the name of Rockeys tackle. He does have great service. I thought I should mention that he will do the repairs but as your a little far away shipping might be an option.
55232,lew,2007-04-04 14:54:00,12767,Here's a MinnKota service center in Waterloo that might be a bit more convenient for you.  Relectronic-Remech  785 Bridge St. W.......unit 3 & 4  Waterloo  519-884-8138
55242,TAH,2007-04-04 15:02:00,133,The Burlington unit will send you to Aikmans
55421,jjcanoe,2007-04-04 23:23:00,744,Thanks guys I think Waterloo would be best for me.  I'll bring it up there when I take my trip north for the trout opener and hopefully pick it up on the way back  jjcanoe
