55582,duber,2007-04-05 13:22:00,220,I can't find a mix ratio on the 1990 merc 9.9 I bought anywere. So I called the guy I bought the motor from and he said 40:1.That seems very rich to me . My dads 1990 Evenrude is 100:1 and my old 1968 Johnson is 50:1.I realize it is better to be a little rich than lean but this motor will be doing alot of trolling so it will run like crap if its to rich.  Thanks  Wes
