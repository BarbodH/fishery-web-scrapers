55167,John,2007-04-04 12:21:00,2956,"As usual, Cliff's advice is well thought out and on the button..........."
55182,misfish,2007-04-04 13:17:00,29133,  That one works everytime.
55252,cantermore,2007-04-04 15:23:00,49,"here's another angle for ya; go to the closest Native reserve & buy some small firecrackers; get a beer & open all doors to the garage except the ones going into the house, then light off a firecracker & through it in the garage... (somewhere safe like in the middle of the floor with no flamables around). A couple minutes later do it & again & repeat the process for aboutt 5 times... then wait, the raccons will walk out the door. I have done this twice & the last time my neighbor that gave me the firecrackers ended up with the coons in his garage & he wasnt impressed but he did the same thing & got rid of them.  Johnny"
55278,Kirk,2007-04-04 16:42:00,347,"On the twit for tat thing...the list of things to do is pretty easy to make and endless, and no doubt the landlord will also have some ideas in reply as well, claiming there is insufficient notice, hidden damages claims etc., my 2 cents is avoid temptation and just be hard to get a hold of but do give them the key and walk away at the end hopefully without any need for dealing with them again.  Starting a fight at the end of the the term just opens the door for having to continue to deal with them down the road."
55280,fishindevil,2007-04-04 16:46:00,6254,"Well joey you sure have some great i deas,and so little time..lol..lol  just make sure you feed the racoons when you leave....our landlord is very simular,and he sure doesnt get any respect from us either ....so hold out as long as you can by delaying the process,and at the last minute say you misplaced the key,and start all over again...anyways good-luck with your problem...and just think soon all that will be just a memory,and you will be in your new place and your mind will be  free of all that crap from your landlord....cheers"
55337,Joey,2007-04-04 19:46:00,9122," Kirk, we have been model tentants and have never missed our rent in 7 years.  Then out of the blue last month I got a registered letter.  It was a Notice of Termination of Tenancy from them.  Their reason - Their son was moving in.  They gave me to the end of my lease (July 31), but asked if we could move out sooner as their son wanted to move in and had to be out of the place he is in by May 1.  So I looked and found a place and am moving to accomodate them.  So I don't think they could possibly have anything to take me to court over.  Joey"
55375,Kirk,2007-04-04 21:10:00,347,"I know Joey, but you wouldn't believe what people can dream up if they have an axe to grind and don't care about lying.  If you are leaving early you should negotiate them paying you for the inconvenience of early termination...if you are in agreement about leaving early, get it all in writing re terminating the lease early etc., otherwise they might claim you left early and still owe rent to July 1 (seen that trick before)."
55381,Big Cliff,2007-04-04 21:15:00,6899,I can tell you from experience thet Kirk's advice = GOOD advice!
55390,POLLIWOGG,2007-04-04 21:37:00,835,"Give them the keys, keep your mouth shut, and get the ell out.  The last thing you want to do is draw any attention. If coons have been in there as long as you say the house should likely be torn down and if some health authorities show up they just might make them do it.  At the least all the insulation should be replaced and the cost will be in the $k's and you don't want anybody looking at you for $ so get out as fast as you can."
55414,Joey,2007-04-04 22:58:00,9122,"Hmmmmm, very sound advice guys.  I guess I'll talk to them when they call next time.  The landlord showed up at noon today when I take my lunch but I didn't answer the door.  He snooped around and I know for a fact the thinks the whole 24 hour notice thing does not pertain to him.  He had an argument with the people who live in the basement about it one time and laughed at them when they told him he had to give notice.  And the tentants before them, he entered their premises before they were moved out and looked around.  Best to get as far away and as fast as possible from this guy.  Thanks everyone.  Joey"
55556,Chris,2007-04-05 11:49:00,405,"As angry as you are at your landlord, my advice would be to turn the other cheek and concentrate on happily moving into your new place. Your landlord will get his just desserts as time goes on. I can't believe some people are suggesting seeking revenge or breaking the law, you're just lowering yourself to your landlords level if you follow that advice. Just my opinion for what it's worth."
54913,Joey,2007-04-03 20:07:00,9122,"As some of you may know, we are moving at the end of the month. We have been here at our present place for seven years and have continually complained about the racoon problem, which fell on deaf ears.  So,  The landlord calls me today and wanted to know if I could give her the key to the garage because they really need to address the racoon problem!!!!!!  I wonder how many different ways there are to say NO.  GAWD, the nerve of some people.   Soooo, should I give them the key  Joey"
54915,Terry,2007-04-03 20:11:00,14456,no way.....now that is low.... with 24 hrs notice he can gain access to your home with or without you there or without your permission but it has to be in writing......so put the sot off as long as you can
54916,vance,2007-04-03 20:13:00,719,Give them A key not necessarily THE key    and pray that you can watch the fun!!!!!!!!!   vance
54917,Heybud_e,2007-04-03 20:13:00,208,didn't the racoon eat the keys???
54919,GbayGiant,2007-04-03 20:15:00,1780,"Heck NO, don't give them the key, they want to take care of the problem now for some future tenants but they wouldn't help you when you asked ? they showed you no respect so don't give them any back. Unless your a saint, then tell them  ""well you wouldn't help us when we asked, but we are not asses like you so we'll let you fix the problem."" and then if they have any conscience they will feel bad and apologize, lol..."
54930,ecxstriper,2007-04-03 20:32:00,343,you could gift wrap the keys in oh say a box of raccoon poo!! 
54940,Joey,2007-04-03 21:05:00,9122,"Well it is their son that will be moving in so I guess that's why its so important now.  Although I think my health and peace of mind was just as important, so I'm just not going to answer my phone if they call.  I'm still galled.  Joey"
54942,steve_paul,2007-04-03 21:09:00,658,Leave a box of raccoon food for the new people and wish them luck
54956,Rich Clemens,2007-04-03 22:11:00,3131,"We can only imagine what was running through your mind when that phone call came.   That's about the time you slap someone silly and say  ""I told you so'.    Idiots."
54960,Roy,2007-04-03 22:16:00,13728,"Joey, racoons LOVE fish. I don't need to tell you where to feed them."
54962,Clampet,2007-04-03 22:25:00,1947,I'm guessing you will never have to use this landlord as a reference in the future.
54964,Carp,2007-04-03 22:29:00,1488,Good idea Roy.  
54966,Clampet,2007-04-03 22:38:00,1947, If'n thar's a loophole 'Ole Roy's bound ta find it!
54975,Jigger,2007-04-03 22:56:00,1237,"Catch one of your racoon ""roommates"" and strap the key to its neck. Then leave the ""roomie"" in the garage when you move out. Better yet, gather up as many raccoons as you can and put them in the garage and invite your landlord over. When he gets there, lead him to the garage and allow him to be the first through the door. Watch the hilarity reach unprecedented levels  . Otherwise, no. Don't give him the key."
54988,Garyv,2007-04-03 23:50:00,547,"You admittedly have a problem and even though they have done nothing before they, upon notification and same confirmed in writing can enter in 24 hours to fix the problem.  If an emergency ( fire, sewer back up, broken pipe etc. ) they have the right to enter without notice and should always have a key to allow the fire dept, police, plumber, tradesman etc. access to fix the problem as it's their obligation to you as a tenant.  So since your perturbed at them avoidance is your best bet, but don't be surprised if the eventually enter and it most likely would hold up in civil court since they have a health issue going here.  For what it's worth our tenants never seem to care about us going in when there is a problem....except the one with all the nice plants!"
54991,Bly,2007-04-04 00:01:00,1556,Whatever you decide to do....I hope it brings you immense satisfaction!  Been several suggestions as to what to do with the key and where to put the key.....wouldn't it be grand if you could place that key right up....well you know!  good luck! bly
54998,Mike the Pike,2007-04-04 00:16:00,3421,  Remember that thread about what to do with your Carp when they are caught Send them to Joey just before she moves.
55041,cisco,2007-04-04 02:07:00,597,"Give them the key but jam a lead pencil point into the keyhole and break it off. Hey, why you asking us all this easy stuff!!!!! What have you done with PAUL?!?!? LOL!"
55051,ryanheritage,2007-04-04 02:30:00,180,"Give her the key and tell her she owes 500.00 in change for clearing up that racoon problem. Tell her you had an exterminator come in. And that ""not to worry, I took care of it."" Then just before you move let the little garbage pickers have free run of the house.... Entice the racoons with some treats right on in to the house. ... Either that add a skunk to the basement so the racoons have  a buddy!"
55072,Joey,2007-04-04 03:11:00,9122,"You guys are killing me here.  These are some sweet revenge ideas.  I love it!!  Thanks everyone.  I haven't quite decided what to do yet, but I'm pretty sure I'll just ignore their calls for now, somewhat along the lines of how they ignored my pleas for ridding this place of the coons  Joey"
55107,camillj,2007-04-04 05:27:00,1988,Painful as it is Joey ... lifes a lot simpler when you be nice  ... too bad every body else doesnt always get that ... but regardless .... YOUR life is normally gonna be better when YOU be nice .... that and as Clampet pointed out (quite correctly) you might wanna give some thought to whether you will (ever) need them as a reference .... if so a little honey goes way farther than the vinegar ... even if you need to wash it off after use
55111,verno,2007-04-04 06:22:00,178,"If I was you Joey I would put it off as long as I could.  Then I would give up the key when I couldnt put it off anymore.  Be careful about baiting them into the house or garage.  If they do more damage and they can prove its your fault it may cause way more hassels for you after you move, and you will end up dealing with these people far longer than you have to. Of course if there are other problems you could always have an inspector come in before you move...."
55123,misfish,2007-04-04 10:02:00,29133,"  Holy crap,they must all be scum lords,(not you Terry) The place we just moved out of,they ripped the whole place apart. I asked for a few things to be done and the same,on deaf ears. Guess whos moving in,yep thier daughter and three GC.  Dont give them nada J."
55141,Guest Trophymuskie,2007-04-04 11:05:00,0,I would accumulate some racoon droppings untill the day I leave and then I would carefully place some in almost every room in the house. That way they will be spending the big $$$ to get an exterminator in to take care of the problem.  And I think you can buy skunk juice.
55142,Big Cliff,2007-04-04 11:08:00,6899,"Joey, you don't have a raccoon problem, you have a landlord problem. I would simply call her back and explain that you had taken her advice and that there isn't a raccoon problem anymore but if she would like to split the cost with you, $325.00 should cover it. You probably won't hear from her again.  However, there is some truth to the old saying ""try not to burn any bridges behind you""!"
