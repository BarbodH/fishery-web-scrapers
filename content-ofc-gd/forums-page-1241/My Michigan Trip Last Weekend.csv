55040,young_one,2007-04-04 01:52:00,620,"Left T.O friday afternoon. First thing Saturday, went to Cabela's. Biggest attraction in Dundee. Very easy to find.   The inside of the store is very nice. VERY BIG   Spent around 20 min just to walk around without a shopping basket. Lots wildlife mount, my camera's memory stick didn't work properly.   Found this small section of the store, where all the hooks/jigs/weights/live minnow are.   Huge selection     Even with minnow slection!     Once pic NF, Junior National All-State Basketball Competition (Sittin down, middle with a ball -> me. This is only the position 3 players, over 200 players from states/Ontario near by Michigan areas was scouted to this tournament.)   Items bought. After purchasing the 997si, parents thought we'll slow down with purchasing other fishing tackles.   Ahh, the packaging was taking ""too much space"" so when we crossed the boarder, we placed it in a fruit basket. Shhh, don't tell anyone, I placed the white box thing along with a heavy blk rectangular monitor that has ""HUMMINGBIRD"" in the glove department of my car. For safety reason ofcourse   149.99 (Mail-in-rebate, $150) "
55042,Dondorfish,2007-04-04 02:10:00,1000,Wow - looks like a nice place. I would like to see that some day soon. Looks like you scored some goodies to boot! Job well done.   Don

55150,motv8tr,2007-04-04 11:40:00,2587,Always nice to get away for a day or two   The pics you took remind me of Bass Pro Shops....who was first?  How far from the border is the store?  Maureen
55206,Smokey,2007-04-04 14:00:00,1278,Thanks for the pics. I've never been to a cabelas yet but going to get there someday. Congrats on the invite to the ball camp thats quite and accomplishment.  Mike
55235,taper,2007-04-04 14:56:00,611,First of all congratulations. I also have a question how far is the Cabelas store from the Windsor boarder?
55249,dustink,2007-04-04 15:11:00,526,"That store in Dundee, MI is great!  We'll be heading up this summer to gear up for our fall trip.  The store is about 70 miles south of Detriot between Detroit & Toledo on US-23.  And it's the ONLY attraction in Dundee!"

55298,GbayGiant,2007-04-04 17:53:00,1780,"Hey congratulations on the Basketball tourney. I use to be a mad baller before I blew out my knees at 22, I know how tough it is for Canadian basketball players to make it, you have to play in the US to have a chance, but Canada is working on it and it's growing nicely. Go Raptors, and Steve Nash.  Good luck Young one, you must be a great player.  What school and province do you play for in Canada or use to play for ?  Oh, nice fishing gear too."
55304,SlowPoke,2007-04-04 18:08:00,2984," Hi Maureen, I'm pretty sure Cabela's was first on the scene and they only have a handfull of stores. Cabela's stores tend to be destinations whereas Bass Pro has many small stores and a handfull of destination-like stores as you would see in Vaughn. I've never been to Cabela's but have been ordering for years through the catologue. (best mail order experiences ever!) The Dundee store is about an hour to an hour and fifteen minutes from the border from what I've been told. -Brian"
