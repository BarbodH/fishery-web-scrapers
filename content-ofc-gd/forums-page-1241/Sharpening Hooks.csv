55445,Rob,2007-04-05 00:35:00,467,"Tie them all to the back of your boat and when you go to boat launch, they will be sharp!! Nice set of lures there! They better catch you lots of fish or there is something wrong!   Rob C"
55447,Fishmaster,2007-04-05 00:39:00,920,Now there's a thought ...LOL
55448,GbayGiant,2007-04-05 00:40:00,1780,"Nice collection.  I'm getting pretty carried away to, but if your serious, last year I found a small electric wet stone grinder laying around so I tried it out. Most of my hooks a 3x strong mustads for pike and musky and they are fairly thick but the stone got all my lures razor sharp in minutes. It worked great but I ruined a few hooks at first, it takes a little finesse."
55452,Blake,2007-04-05 00:45:00,418,Each person you take out give them a sharpener when they set foot onto the boat and they have to sharpen until your out on your spot.
55453,tjsa,2007-04-05 00:48:00,1578,"Yup, what GbayGiant said, a small wet grinder, you can buy them at CTC, otherwise you are using a hand electric(battery) operated one, or a manual dry one(EZLap)."
