54880,GbayGiant,2007-04-03 17:58:00,1780," I'm on jin clear water and 99% of the time use PP or Spider wire with a long floro leader for every species, can't be beat.   If you haven't used super lines your missing out, they are far more sensitive, better hook-sets, won't break like mono, and you think it's expensive but it lasts a few years at least, and you only have to put around 100yards over some mono."
54883,woodro,2007-04-03 18:06:00,168,"anyone else ever try the Super Braid by Stren? I personally think its better then Power pro, stays rounder, casts jsut at far and maintains its coating much longer the PP. Ive been using power pro for approximately four full seasons and have found that PP loses its shape and coating after a couple weeks use, but last iyear i decided to try a couple new types of line, Fireline being one of them, which i personally didnt like at all, and also the STREN and im sticking to it, i feel extremely confident with the product.  http://tackledirect.com/stren-super-braid-fishing-line.html"
54886,Cookslav,2007-04-03 18:25:00,1457,"Different lines for different situations I S'pose. I use PP for pretty much all aplications except for 4 scenarios... #1- When useing Light action Spinning gear for Spring time, specs, Lakers, and steelhead. #2- fall Trout fishing.... #3- Open water down rigging for Salmon/steelhead and lakers.... #4- On the Fly rod in search of Browns...  So basicaly I use it for everything except Salmonoids. When after them little beuties....I use P-line.(rave reviews on both products personally) Might try P-line Halo this year....we'll see  But I have to point out the no stretch factor of PP makes it Ideal for hook sets...especialy when trolling."
54887,Cookslav,2007-04-03 18:25:00,1457,"I Did try Fire line once.... I must have got a bad spool or something because it got reeeeeely frayed in a short period of time? I liked its non-stretch factor, and strength was good, but I found the Diameter was noticably thicker then PP?"

54278,Northhunter,2007-04-02 02:43:00,214,"I tried Stren Super Braid briefly a few years ago and had the same experience as duber - It's softer and more supple, but it tangles like thread as a result. I had unexpected break-offs as well.  I'd like to try IronSilk again. It was a nice compromise between mono and the superlines, except the stuff of a few years ago didn't like UV rays."

54369,bpsbassman,2007-04-02 12:05:00,941,PP on most of my rods for two years now and very happy with it.  I did buy some Stren super braid and will give it a try.

54421,bucktail,2007-04-02 15:20:00,1857,I find PP easier to work with. Fireline I like for heavy weeds were i need to cut thru them. The problem with Fireline is that it needs to be worked in and made more subtle. It is very stiff and wiry when you first put it on. I started using Fireline Chrystal but havent had it long enough to comment. Maybe after pike openor i will have a little better idea. On my musky rods I have Berkely Whiplash which I find very comparable to PP.

PP all the way on my medium/heavy spinning rig - use it as a main line for carp, tossing giant lures for fall salmon, or for throwing baits into heavy heavy weed cover...  I'm curious to know if PP or other highly visible braids cause problems when fishing gin clear water...... I've got 8lb stren on my ultra light and have to say that it treats me well!  Cheers, UF"

54811,charlesn,2007-04-03 14:42:00,551," Skeeter99,  I think you are thinking of George Cochran.  He was caught blatantly lying about using a Strike King product when he was using a Lucky Craft Pointer.  He won an FLW event on Lake Guntersville in March of 2004 I believe.  He later apologized and said it was bad judgment to do so.  He then got caught lying again when he caught fish on a Berkley Power Tube but said it was on a Strike King tube.  KVD was sponsored by pradco (Bomber, Smithwick, etc.) for a long time.  I've seen him talk about Rogues and Bombers too.   My first really good jerk bait was a Bomber Long A Signature Series Van Dam model.  He's not one to jeopardize his reputation to lie about what he is using.  http://www.bassfan.com/news_article.asp?ID=1432  That's the archived article where he talks about how his own designed bait wasn't the right one for the fish and why he used the Smithwick.  Charles"
54815,charlesn,2007-04-03 14:46:00,551,"I've tried TUF, PP, Stren Superbraid, Gorilla Braid and the original Spiderwire.  I have to say I like the Stren Superbraid the best.  The price at the recent Bass Pro Spring Classic was sick, $15 for a 300 yard spool.  PP is $22-24 / 150 yards.  And the Stren stuff is better manageable.  There was a batch a few years ago where Power Pro produced some junk, or perhaps it was a knock off.  But because of that, I go with Stren.  But if PP were the cheapest, I would go with that.  I think most 65 lb braids are pretty similar and will last a long time.  Charles"
54875,BFSC Kevin,2007-04-03 17:41:00,1351,really? the superbraid was $15 for 300? i know it was that for 2006 but i didn't know they had it for 2007! dammit.. or else i would've picked up another spool.. oh well...
54134,BFSC Kevin,2007-04-01 21:59:00,1351,"Well i've used only spider wire and stren super braid. I found the super braid really good, very little memory and smooth casts.. The spirder wire i thoght was a bit sticky so it didn't cast too well.. never used power pro before, hows that?"
54136,GbayGiant,2007-04-01 22:04:00,1780,"I like spider wire and PP, PP is a little easier to tie its got a rounder profile to it. I also use the Cortland super line, it's just like braid but it's a lot thicker and almost floats on the surface like fly line, if you want a high presentation or to keep your lure up."
54138,irishfield,2007-04-01 22:07:00,26272,I've only used Power Pro on my bait casters.... for about the last 4 years. I've had no good reason presented to me to switch to something else....  I still use Trilene on my spinning reels.

54179,Bernie,2007-04-01 23:43:00,3190,Has anyone tried or heard of P-line? Seen it the other day and the sales guy told me lots of guys like it. I felt it and it seemed a lot like spiderwire for limpness and feel. I decided to find out about it before purchasing.

54186,Bernie,2007-04-01 23:50:00,3190,It felt and appeared like a braid Ben. Really didnt look to close at the box to tell me what its makeup was. Next time Im in North Bay I'll swing by Lefeves and have a closer look.

54193,BFSC Kevin,2007-04-02 00:00:00,1351,im really curious to try out some PP on my some of my reels then..
54201,Northhunter,2007-04-02 00:07:00,214,"I like Fireline. It doesn't sound so smooth when it's coming through the guides under load and eventually the coating wears off, but that's about it. I think it casts great?? I'd like to try the clear stuff, although depending how light hits it might be better off with black/smoke.  I tried PowerPro because everyone and their brother it seemed was raving about it. I like it but it definetly has its faults. I don't use the 50-80lb test the musky guys do, but the lighter stuff is anything but abbrasian resistant. Loses its die and turns whitish rather quickly as well. If they sold it in ""standard"" amounts it would cost 40-50 bucks a spool. You only get 125yds for your $20, which hurts."
54221,fishersquige,2007-04-02 00:25:00,52,Power Pro has been great to me on both my baitcasting and spinning reels thus far.  Over time the line does turn white but doesn't effect the line what so ever for me anyways it hasn't and it does say in the box that it does turn white but with no effect.  Other than that I will be trying stren super braid this summer because its a lot softer than a lot of the other brands and more supple as well.
54224,Raf,2007-04-02 00:30:00,3495,"tuf line, only because it's cheaper than power pro."
54226,MJL,2007-04-02 00:32:00,2427,I still have 20lb powerpro on my 2000 Stradic from 2001...Still going strong with little sign of wear.  I may reverse the line around sometime this year to extend the life.
54237,duber,2007-04-02 01:08:00,220,I like pp on every thing except my ultra-lights.When it turns white I just run it threw a wax china marker.It is recoloured and recoated with wax and good as new.I tried the stren superbraid on my one spining reel last year and I had nothing but problems with tangles and some unexpected break-offs.So i'm back to pp only.
54240,danc,2007-04-02 01:16:00,4677,Personally I've never tried braid. Probably never will. Mono works just fine for me.
