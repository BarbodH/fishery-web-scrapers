55329,silvio,2007-04-04 19:20:00,433,How is the fishing are the bows still running or are they mostly done and in the upper sections? I will be fishing relatively close to the lake. If you want you can also pm me if you don't want to post. Thank you
55332,irishfield,2007-04-04 19:37:00,26272,I'd highly suggest that you'd better be fishing >IN< the lake......
55338,silvio,2007-04-04 19:47:00,433,what do you mean by that? are they at the mouth or are you trying to say the rivers blown ??
55343,Fisherman,2007-04-04 19:51:00,7201,"Rivers only open from #89 north, not really considered the ""uuper sections"""
55360,silvio,2007-04-04 20:36:00,433,by upper I mean the closed sections
55370,wallacio,2007-04-04 20:55:00,475,"Considering the recent rain, if it's not blown yet at the lower end it will be shortly.  If you haven't already done so, bookmark this site...  http://scitech.pyr.ec.gc.ca/waterweb/formNav.asp  Make note of the water level under ideal conditions so that you have a frame of reference for the future.

55410,irishfield,2007-04-04 22:36:00,26272," Just ignore me...still stuck in the days that every river flowing into GBay, from Div 4, was off limits above the mouth... until last saturday in April. I haven't done the river thing for over 20 years and forgot the notty had the exception...but still unsure why it's different.  Even the bighead in Meaford use to have a pole driven into the shoreline about 15 feet from the lake and you couldn't fish above it. Now I see that you can fish right up to the highway. Makes no sense if we want fish to reach the spawning grounds IMHO, but....."
