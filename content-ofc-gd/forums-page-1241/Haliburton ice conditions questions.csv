The edges are getting pretty weird.  Cold nights are keeping it in shape but melting shorelines are making access sketchy.  I doubt it holds up for much more than a few more days, all huts are off and many popular spots aren't being used for a couple days now."

54102,turtle,2007-04-01 20:32:00,274,Fished Saturday in the north end of Haliburton.  About a foot of soft ice with the shore ice melting and broken up.  Will not last long.  River water levels are low and most of the snow is gone. Open water on the south part of Mitchell Lk. on hwy 48 on the way back.
54123,andrey7474,2007-04-01 21:37:00,47,"Yesterday I was fishing on some medium-size lake in Haliburton area. Approximately 80% of ice is still walkable, Iâ€™ve even seen some guys driving ski-doos. Thickness varies between 3-10 inches. However ice structure is not glass-like. There are also places with open water, especially in shallow places, near the shore and at river-mouths. I think it will be the last week for ice fishing."
55070,Norpiker,2007-04-04 03:06:00,21,Thanks Audrey  I hope you had a great ice fishing season I doubt i'll be fishing in open waters in haliburton on the Easter Weekend I'll be sure to keep those posted on Ice-out conditions when i get back from the cottage  Happy Easter!!
