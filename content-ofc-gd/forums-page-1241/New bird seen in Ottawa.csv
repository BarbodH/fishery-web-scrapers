55632,RobHall,2007-04-05 15:01:00,261,Here are a few jokes.  What do the Leafs and The Titanic have in common? - They both look good until they hit the ice.  Do you know how many leafs it takes to win the Stanley Cup? - No? Me neither.  Why is the Hockey Hall of Fame in Toronto? - It's the only way the Stanley Cup will ever be in Toronto.  Why don't the Maple Leafs drink tea? - Because the Canadiens have all the cups.  Whats the difference between the Leafs and a cigarette machince? - The cigarette machince has PLAYER'S.  Here is my answer to OP......    FOTB 
55637,RobHall,2007-04-05 15:11:00,261,"Here's another one.....  One day, Satan was out for a walk through Hell, making sure things were running smoothly. When he got to the Lake of Fire, he saw a man sitting by the lake, relaxing in a lawn chair, and not sweating or looking uncomfortable at all. Perplexed, Satan approached the man and asked:  ""Young man, are you not hot or bothered by this heat?"" The man replied, ""Oh no, not at all. I lived in downtown Ottawa and this weather is just like a typical July day in the city.""  Satan thought that this was not a good sign, so he rushed back to his office and turned up the heat in Hell another 100 degrees. Satisfied with himself, he again returned to the Lake of Fire to check on the young man.  When he got there, the man was showing a few beads of sweat, but that was all. Again Satan asked the Ottawa native,  ""Are you hot and uncomfortable yet?""  The young man looked up and said, ""No, the temperature is just like a hot August day in Ottawa. I'm coping it just fine.""  Satan decided that he had to do something drastic to make this man's stay in Hell unpleasant. He went back to his office, turned the heat all the way down, and then turned up the air conditioning. The temperature in Hell quickly dropped well below zero. As he approached the Lake of Fire, he noticed that it was now frozen over. He also saw the young man jumping up and down wildly, waving his arms and yelling into the air.  ""This looks promising!"" thought Satan. Coming closer, he finally made out what the man was shouting:  ""The Leafs have won the Stanley Cup! The Leafs have won the Stanley Cup!""   FOTB "
