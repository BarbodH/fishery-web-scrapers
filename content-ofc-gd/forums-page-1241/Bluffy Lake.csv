54842,Bob Apple,2007-04-03 15:53:00,37,"They, call me Bob, I'm from the midwest in the US. I am going fishing with some buddies at this, Bluffy Lake, just wondering how the fishing is there."
54882,RobHall,2007-04-03 18:05:00,261,"I would guess you will be staying at Bluffy Lake Lodge.  One thing i can say.....Both the Wenesaga River & the White Mud River provide boat access to Ogani & White Mud Lake from Bluffy Lake.  There is excellent Walleye and Northern Pike fishing in all 3 lakes, as well as the rivers.  You have lots of spots to choose from.  My brother went up there in 2004 and i recall him saying the fishing was was excellent on Bluffy and the cabins were very clean.  He mentioned something about taking an ATV and a boat to get to the cabins.  I can't offer much more then that.  FOTB "

55670,tjsa,2007-04-05 15:54:00,1578,"Ahh,. gotta love Mapsource, didn't know where Bluffy Lake was until I did a search for it. North of Lac Seul,  should be good for walleye, but since I have never been there, dunno for sure.  Give us a report, with pictures, when you get home."
