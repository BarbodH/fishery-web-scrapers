55207,John,2007-04-04 14:03:00,2956,  FRANK Warwick kicked off his catfishing career in spectacular style by banking this enormous 203lb specimen from Spainâ€™s River Segre on his first ever trip targeting the species......
55233,taper,2007-04-04 14:54:00,611,That is one ugly fish.
55260,mdej,2007-04-04 16:02:00,98,Now was that caught by hand (whatever they call it) or was is rod and reel.  He must be a strong guy cause I don't think I could hold up a 203lb fish.
55284,John,2007-04-04 16:52:00,2956, I can only go by the article in Angling Times (UK). It was rod and line caught.  I think that the way that I see the photo is that he is sat with that enormous belly over his knees...

55344,ecxstriper,2007-04-04 19:52:00,343,"the style of catfishing you are thinking about is called noodling , and I think those cats in Spain would drown you if that technique was tried!   http://www.catmastertours.com/location.asp"
