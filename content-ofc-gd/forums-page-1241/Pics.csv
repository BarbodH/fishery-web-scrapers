54823,ccmtcanada,2007-04-03 14:59:00,7971,Nice pics!
54844,fishindevil,2007-04-03 15:54:00,6254,"cool pics...i see you caught that musky while ice fishing, he must have got your heart pumping..  ...ive only ever caught 1 while ice fishing and i thought i had a huge walleye on....well it must have made your day....cheers"
54869,Josh Rogers,2007-04-03 17:11:00,79,Yep I got the musky ice fishing. It was my second one this year. We were fishing for perch and I always set the tip up in a little shallower to go for the pike that are in the lake. That was better than catching a pike though. It definately did get my heart going. You may be able to tell from the picture that my smoke isn't lit. The flag going up sort of took me by surprise! That's my pb fish through the ice.
54872,Josh Rogers,2007-04-03 17:13:00,79,Thanks ccmt I'm just happy I got the pictures up here so now everyone knows I'm not just telling stories about the fish that I catch.
54893,Jen,2007-04-03 18:41:00,833,"Great post, awesome fish... ( haven't seen fish in a while, other than in pictures so I am jealous!)  Cheers, Jen"
54898,BryceBurzynski,2007-04-03 19:21:00,181,Nice fish! I really like the Muskie!
54959,Rich Clemens,2007-04-03 22:14:00,3131,Ahhhhhhh .. .Musky season is just around the corner.       I needed that - just what the doctor ordered.   Thanks bud.
55104,kennyman,2007-04-04 05:00:00,737,"Nice muskie. Somehow it's seems like it'd be a hard thing to do. Putting your hand blindly through the ice, knowing there's a muskie on the other side. AWESOME!"
55112,verno,2007-04-04 06:30:00,178,"Those are some nice looking fish, looks like a good day."
55268,mattyk,2007-04-04 16:15:00,2110,"nice fish, especially the muskie!"
55273,Bigfish,2007-04-04 16:26:00,19,Cool pics!
55724,Josh Rogers,2007-04-05 17:25:00,79,Thanks fellas. The pics of musky are always big draws especially ones that come throught the ice. That one is just a baby compared to the 25 lber that my bro got last year through the ice. Now that was an experience that I will never forget.
