55096,taper,2007-04-04 04:32:00,611,I bought an Eagle Fishstrike 2000 and love it. This is my first colour unit and I don't think I will ever go back.
55102,Roy,2007-04-04 04:50:00,13728,I think I've used every sonar known to man over the years. I know that a lot of people love them but my worst experiences have been with Humminbirds. I now use Lowrance......have for the last 8 years or so. I have an old X-85 at the bow....just a super sonar. And just recently installed an LCX 25C at the back... just a great dependable piece of equipment.
55145,Blake,2007-04-04 11:17:00,418,I use Lowrance and recommend them by far over any other.  I use the Lcx17M on the dash and and a LMS480 on the front both with gps and they are great for location and detail of bottom and marking fish.
55146,Terry,2007-04-04 11:28:00,14456,"I have used fishfinders for years and years flashers paper graphs,  CRT tube screens and LCD finders  I always found that in 15ft of water or less they were bottom/weed finders not fishfinders  then I bought the Lowrance x15 and it was like I had never used a real fishfinder before trolling in 9ft of water I was marking fish on or within 1inch of the bottom and catching them to me it is the single best fishing buy I have made to date"
