55402,bassman,2007-04-04 22:11:00,384,I saw the SnoBear on Real Fishing last week. One of the coolest ice fishing vehicles I've ever seen.  Does anyone know how much they cost?  http://www.snow-bear.com/
55404,Dondorfish,2007-04-04 22:13:00,1000,"Think that I read somewhere that they were $22,000 U.S.  Don"
55405,canadian_copper,2007-04-04 22:14:00,925,DEFINATELY A SWEET RIDE!!! I SAW THAT SHOW AS WELL!!! SURE WOULD BE NICE!!!
55406,irishfield,2007-04-04 22:17:00,26272,"Mid 30's + tax Cdn. ""Nippissing"" and his brothers at Geisler Marine in Powassan have/had one for sale.  I believe the higher price in Canada includes Bob Izumies(sp) commission...."
55411,easton13th,2007-04-04 22:38:00,371,If it had a convertible top and was buoyant it would be the ultimate amphibious vehicle what else would you need other than a trolling motor
55417,Mike the Pike,2007-04-04 23:12:00,3421, Easton they did mention on the show that if it falls through the ice it will float.
55419,Bernie,2007-04-04 23:15:00,3190,It does float. Ultimate fish shack for sure.
55420,easton13th,2007-04-04 23:18:00,371,I may have to order one....or not! It is missing a hot tub so that was the deal breaker.
55430,Cast-Away,2007-04-04 23:59:00,790,TJ has one.
55432,Garyv,2007-04-05 00:03:00,547,Ok links below will give you a lot more info on them...like 4000 hours of engineering that went into it.  Price From $33000 to $50000 US dollars....  http://money.cnn.com/2007/01/30/magazines/...g.fsb/index.htm  http://www.oemoffhighway.com/article/artic...on=2&id=113
55434,tjsa,2007-04-05 00:08:00,1578,"Saw the Snowbear trailer a few months ago, neat vehicle, but unpractical for where I go.  Betcha Joe and Art could whip up a similar downsized one, with a jet drive for softwater season, in a week,"
