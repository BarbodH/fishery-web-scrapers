55208,lew,2007-04-04 14:04:00,12767,"2001 Merc 4 stroke....90 HP  I need to buy a new socket for the prop nut on my motor, but can't remember the size.  I'm thinking it's 1-1/16.......anybody know off hand ??"
55227,taper,2007-04-04 14:46:00,611,"Not sure of the size Lew but I found the plastic prop wrenches to be great. Just leave in glove box, they are light and being made of plastic they don't break everything they hit against. They are colour coded, I know yellow fits the new Yamaha's. I think they are about $15-$20 at the dealer."
55231,taper,2007-04-04 14:53:00,611,Lew I just checked you are right it is 1  1/16th.
55239,lew,2007-04-04 15:00:00,12767,"Thanks Taper, I appreciate that.  I've used those plastic wrenches before but found they don't last too long and end up being stripped. I usually remove my prop about once a month to check for any mono line so I need something that'll stand up."
55246,taper,2007-04-04 15:06:00,611,Thank you Lew. You just reminded me of one thing I didn't do in the fall when putting the boat away. I'll pull the prop this weekend and check.

55403,Garyv,2007-04-04 22:13:00,547,Here's a couple of tools for you to pick from.  Since I often remove props in the water the ties go around my wrist to avoid dropping the tool.

You should never have to ""wrench"" down on the prop nut too much, just enough to snug it up. This will not strip the wrench.  Then when you put the cotter pin on it will stay snug.  It's designed in such a way as to tighten when under power.  I have yet to see mine loosen off with just a snug of the wrench."
