They are meant for youngsters aged 1-101  and believe it or not they are catchy tunes! I find myself singing them or humming them often! ""I see a barefoot bear... He walks without a worry or a care...""     or             ""3 Bears shelled the peanuts 8 Bears mashed them up, 12 Bears put the peanut butter into the peanut butter cups, although the words are hard to understand I found myself singing along... we really like peanut butter.....""    The artists name is Brent Holmes    He is one of the best selling children's recording artists in North America (according to his Album covers) here are a few of his recordings:  Moose tunes for kids Cow tunes for kids Sea tunes for kids Fun tunes for teachers MooseBeary Jams Beary ChristMoose and my sons favourite Bear Tunes for kids.  If you are interested in kid friendly music Google Brent Holmes Music or Brent Holmed Cds  A neat thing about his cds is he includes ""Fun Facts"" about the animals the songs are about... they last about 10-15 minutes and teach kids about the animals he is singing about... believe it or not I learned a couple things! Such as Bears will not hibernate if they have an abundant source of food.. they hibernate do to lack of forage.. I had an idea as to why they hibernate, but didnt bother seeking out the answer for whatever reason...cool facts about Grizzley's and Polar bears too!  Anyways.. if you want to get a child a good gift for a special holiday.. consider his CD's  I am not affiliated with this artist in any way shape or form... but his music is fun, my son loves it and it in educational!    Gerritt."

55060,Dutch,2007-04-04 02:39:00,831,"It's great when you can entertain them using something educational. Thanks for the post, might make a nice b-day gift for my 4 year old nephew."

55079,Jen,2007-04-04 03:40:00,833,"Great songs G, I will definately pick up the CD's... even though my kids are older I am sure they will love them!  Mixed in with Billy Talent, I know I will love the break!  Cheers  Jen"
55113,verno,2007-04-04 06:34:00,178,It's funny how kids stuff sticks in  your head.  My old man loves when our son is over because he gets to watch little bear!!  I keep telling him its the circle of life.
55185,snag,2007-04-04 13:23:00,1932,My son is nearing his 1st b-day. Sounds great! (pun intended)  Would HMV have these? maybe the library?  Thanks
55286,Gerritt,2007-04-04 16:56:00,6129,I think you can order them directly from their website  probably save a couple bucks too.  Gerritt.
