Your kids will love it too as I think there is a park near by, along with a nice community centre.  When you're settled let me know, I have a few customers in the area too  Maureen"

(IF I ever figure out how to do it!LOL) Perhaps an OFC East end swill may be in order some time in the summer! Everyone bring their boat and we can ""practice"" backing it in! Give me an idea how big of a boat will fit! HH"

When my wife and I were house hunting 5 years ago, we saw a bunch of houses that we'd have been happy in.  We were mulling over putting offers in on a few of them when we saw the house we are in now.  We LOVED the house and knew it.  I told her that when we saw the right house for us we'd know it....as soon as we walked in and toured, we knew this was the house for us.  The price was right and was just listed that same day.  By 8pm that night, we put an offer in...the offer was exactly what they asked for and we agreed to all conditions.  No other offers came in that day.  By 11pm, I was signing the papers.  End result, the owners were ticked at their agent cause we were the first to see the house and we offered what they were asking...they thought they should have asked for more.  Their agent had to explain that the price was at market value and that they were actually lucky that someone came in at the offer price so quickly.  Dont risk losing the house you REALLY want over 5 or 10 grand or wanting an extra 5 days closing time.  Just my opinion...  Congrats again! Cliff"
