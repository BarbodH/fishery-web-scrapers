Ah h h  h . . . .     well, if nuthin' more, it'll blow the 'skeeters & black flies away. Watta way to start a holiday . . .    -3, with up to 45 klick breeze . . . .    THE FIRST WEEK OF APRIL?? Oh well . . .   if anybody else happens to be out east this mornin,' I'm the guy just south of the trestle, shivering, & runnin' a float down the river, in front of the black van. Bring a tape measure to record the 32"" 'bow I'm gonna hook!"

I did fish a fairly sheltered spot for a few hours, but the wind switched to the northwest, at about 30 klicks, and with -5 temp, I decided I really wasn't all that keen on trout for supper . . .   maybe I'll open a can of tuna . . . .   better chemicals, eh!"
55660,glirw,2007-04-05 15:39:00,200,Well at least you got out Steve ! Better luck next time !
