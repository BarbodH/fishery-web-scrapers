My question is what made you buy Lowrance if there was a comparable Eagle product, as the Lowrance units are usually a couple hundred $ more. I know about NEMA 2000 but I don't think that is an issue for most of our smaller fishing boats. I am asking because I want to add a fish finder to my bow mount this year and I am trying to decide on model. Do any of you have suggestions for a colour FF for the bow and will I have interference issues with my main unit."

55259,Raf,2007-04-04 16:01:00,3495,"The Lowrance sonars generally come with a higher powered transducer and sometimes additional options compared to their Eagle counterparts.   I own an Eagle unit myself and my next will be Eagle or Lowrance as well. They've been doing this a long time, build quality products and should anything go wrong, their office is in Mississausage.  I'd be interested to hear any ideas for avoiding interfernce myself because it has been an issue in DipLips boat when we have both our sonars on at the same time (Eagle Fishmark 320 on the bow & Lowrance X-15 stern)"
55262,mdej,2007-04-04 16:05:00,98,I don't know much about them.  But I know I'm considering the X67c as my bow mount replacement.  I have an older sonar that just does not do anything in the muddy bottomed waters I fish.
