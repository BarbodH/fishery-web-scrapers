55302,Entropy,2007-04-04 18:01:00,747,anyone know if this motor would have above or through-prop exhaust?  Entropy
55323,Bernie,2007-04-04 19:02:00,3190,What size engine?
55326,Entropy,2007-04-04 19:18:00,747,sorry 20hp
55331,Bernie,2007-04-04 19:29:00,3190,Not through hub. Gearcases are not strong enough for the torque that engine developed that year.
55459,Zib,2007-04-05 01:06:00,369,My in-laws have an '81 50 HP Evinrude on their pontoon boat & the exhaust is NOT through the prop.
