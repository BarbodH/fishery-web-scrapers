55362,icefisherman,2007-04-04 20:42:00,952,"Hi Guys,  I am considering buying one year old Eagle FishMarkâ„¢ 480 fish finder. After all the negotiation I got the price down to $150. Unit is is great condition and comes with trandsducer and power cords.  Do you think it's a good deal? I need to confirm with the seller ASAP so hope someone can advice me on this quickly.  I have an old 515 Humminbird I've been thinking to replace for a while....the old one is working fine but I'd like to upgrade a bit and get more resolution without having to spend 2 arms and 3 legs on a $700-$800 new color Lawrence unit. I've been considering those for a while, including the ones that come with fishfiner and GPS but maybe for my new boat ....one day;-)  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
