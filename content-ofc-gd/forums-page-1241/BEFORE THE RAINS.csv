54943,dsn,2007-04-03 21:12:00,1018,Nice report as usual. I Like the pic where your holding the steel with one hand and taking the pic with the other.  They normal don't behave that well. The fish really stands out!! I guess the fish feels the power of those fingers.  It dears not to move or it'll get squashed.
