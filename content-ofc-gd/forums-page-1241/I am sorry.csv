55547,Roy,2007-04-05 11:07:00,13728,"I've been working my tail off getting things done to try to have a 4 day weekend...it doesn't look good. Woke up to trees heavy with freshly fallen snow. Looked at the 10 day forcast here and it looks as though there'll be snow/rain for the next week till Saturday. But hey, I'm breathing, mobile, have food on the table, my kids are healthy. It could be a lot worse.  Have a great day."
