600796,phishfearme,2011-07-09 00:34:00,20,"i just joined this board after reading the latest moosebunk ""short story"" on his trip to the attawapiskat - a link to which he posted on walleyecentral.com under the ""canada eh?"" board where i'm a charter member.  realy enjoyed moosebunks posting and have scanned the topics here and decided to join in.  i note from the member map that this is mostly a board consisting of south eastern ontario members - most all of my trips are to NW ontario and i go to fly-in outpost camps on private lakes.  i post trip reports annually as ""phishfearme"" on WC.  (i joined here as ""phishfearme"" also but for some reason only ""phish"" comes up - no big deal.)  my latest trip report can be seen at:  http://www.walleyecentral.com/forums/showthread.php?t=183179  i have no economic interest in any of the outfitter i use - i only want to provide experience (good and bad) for others to refer to in the future.  i note that ""tooski"" is also on this board - watch out!  those clevelanders need constant monitoring.  i'm looking forward to adding to this board and to ""meet"" new fishing buddies.  phish"

601024,Moosebunk,2011-07-10 01:05:00,3970,"Nice!  Welcome!  You'll like it here with your kind.  Plenty of ""grey""beards like Lew, Terry, Roy, TJ, Wayne and even Randy from Sturg and that other guy who's gettin' up there... Solo... and Clemens, and Misfish, the Plumma Clan... heck... there's dozens more too.  Most fish with a hook and sinker or gang troll for everything... and if you have any questions about life before the Great Depression, just ask Lew.  Any questions about boobs, ask TJ, or beer and speckled trout we got DanC, another ""experienced"" (nice for aged) fella.  I'll go enjoy your report now."
