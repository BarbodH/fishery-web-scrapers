601855,Rod Caster,2011-07-12 01:38:00,5784,Mercman's dog would probably lick it up.
601896,Hooked,2011-07-12 02:42:00,891,"Here is a link on how to remove the keyboard.  You can either replace it, but I would actually try it in the dishwasher once removed.  Sounds crazy but I have heard it done and works well apparently.  You can google/youtube that as well.    Good luck."
601913,kickingfrog,2011-07-12 03:26:00,8333,Thanks for the link. One challenge is that every generation is slightly different then the previous. I'll work away at it over the next couple of days.
601928,dhickey,2011-07-12 04:06:00,1038,I would think that the (acid ) in the bile would do the most damage on the electronics under the keys?(sticky keys) I would replace the keybourd but if you take it apart look for traces of corrosion around terminals. Iwould probably take it in to a reputable service company and just tell them what happend you anrt the first.  Ps . Still looking for that algae/weed?  Saltydawg.
601578,kickingfrog,2011-07-11 17:35:00,8333,So my little guy puked on my lap top this morning. Curdled milk and bile all over the keyboard part. I shut it off right away and sopped up as much as I could be for heading out the door for work.  What do I do now?  Thanks
601579,Spiel,2011-07-11 17:38:00,9065,Have lunch.
601581,Joeytier,2011-07-11 17:41:00,3990,"Put the laptop, open, in a bowl of rice overnight at least.  It's worked for me more than once, on various electronics including laptops.  None of which were puke though..."
601588,BillM,2011-07-11 17:47:00,17367,"Rice isn't going to work with puke, lol!!!"
601592,Dozer,2011-07-11 17:53:00,896,"I'm sure the rice would suck up some moisture. Never had to deal with somethng like this before, my only guess would be to open it up and clean it up real nice.  Once the kid turns 16 I think a laptop for Daddy from Santa may be a good idea."
601598,umKthxbye,2011-07-11 18:05:00,247,"Remove keyboard, hose down, let dry with rice or air, reinstall. If after reinstall it doesn't working order a new keyboard off eBay for cheap and replace the keyboard. They are fairly easy to replace."
601600,John,2011-07-11 18:10:00,2956, It's a laptop............
601607,BillM,2011-07-11 18:21:00,17367, Still can remove the keyboard   Very simple process.
601611,BucktownAngler,2011-07-11 18:31:00,582,Puke on something of his
601616,Joey,2011-07-11 18:35:00,9122,Don't feed him whatever it was that made him puke anymore
601620,Roy,2011-07-11 18:38:00,13728,You could feed the kid brightly coloured and nicely textured foods and stand him in front of an easel.
601622,Spiel,2011-07-11 18:39:00,9065,  Aren't you glad you asked.  
601634,kickingfrog,2011-07-11 18:54:00,8333,Thanks for tips so far... I think.  It's a macbook pro.  I'm openning it up and letting it air out.
601645,John,2011-07-11 19:20:00,2956, I use a pressure washer on pretty much everything.........about a 50/50 success rate
601649,craigdritchie,2011-07-11 19:34:00,1586,LMAO - We have a winner!!!!
601653,Nipfisher,2011-07-11 19:41:00,2449,I guessing you removed the batery? I would do that before washing it down in any way. I also heard of people puting their wet electronics in the freezer over night then drying them out the next day. It worked with my wife's cell phone.
601654,Nipfisher,2011-07-11 19:42:00,2449,  I'm guessing he was reading one of Terry's threads when he puked?
601655,muskymike,2011-07-11 19:47:00,772, 
601659,kickingfrog,2011-07-11 19:56:00,8333, He's 2 and a half... everything he owns has been puked on more than once already.
601694,misfish,2011-07-11 21:04:00,29133," With todays temps,me thinks you,ll be pukeing yerself when you open it."
601696,irishfield,2011-07-11 21:05:00,26272,MAC Book Pro.. our younger daughter would most likely suggest throwing it in the garbage before it lets you down right before a big assignment is almost completed or an exam the next morning!
601728,umKthxbye,2011-07-11 21:50:00,247,Oh that's good. Those are cake to open and replace. The keyboard cost 25-35$ on eBay. I had to replace a keyboard for someone who spilled a bong on their MBP.
601808,muskymike,2011-07-12 00:11:00,772," Ah Wayne, she must have had a lemon. I know at least 30 people including myself that have Macbook Pros and no one has had an issue with any.  Thats too bad. PC's are much worse. I have one too."
601812,irishfield,2011-07-12 00:23:00,26272,"The majority all have/had a video card recall Mike if they are of any age. And others just failed period and didn't fit their serial number spread and they tried to turn their back on servicing them. Her's was a lemon from the start... but almost her entire University Arc hitecture class was ready to boycot MAC in 2009/2010 as they had over 50 units fail in one double semester. Never at a good time... She got her's fixed free, but only after our son made a ruckus big enough in the ""Genius"" store in the Eaton Centre that they called security to try to remove him. Luckily a well versed store manager figured out who he was, considered his position in the computer world, and made the repairs happen in under an hour."
601814,ChrisK,2011-07-12 00:27:00,2772,Wet dry vac ???
