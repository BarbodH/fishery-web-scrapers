601501,rhymobot,2011-07-11 15:05:00,174,"Gonna spend a weekend on the strip in The Falls this summer.  Know of some good spots I can fish within a 20 minute drive?  What about from shore in Niagara River rapids next to Whirpool golf course for trout?  Anywhere to put an inflatable boat in and go for walleye, bass, or pike?   I know there is this park with a big pond that holds carp but not too interested in that.   Thanks for any help."
