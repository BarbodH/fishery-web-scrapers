Went to Mountsberg since we have the Halton family pass which gets me free admission. Wasn't really sure where to go since I hadn't seen the water before so I just hung out on the dock.  This year I have been carrying a small pack of hooks in my pocket, a bag of soft plastics, then usually 3 rods: 1 spinning with a Senko, 1 spinning with a jig and grub, and a baitcaster with a surface frog. Between those 3 I never need to change a lure except to try a different colour once in a while.  Caught this little guy on a jig, black & yellow:    Was really hoping to see some Largies, but no go. Next time I will walk the shore a bit more.I noticed a lot of people fishing near the train tracks, but somehow I feel like walking along a train track and standing like 10 feet from a few hundred tons of moving machinery is more than I'm willing to do to catch a fish. Maybe I'm getting too cautious in my old age  Anyhow, good luck to everyone."

601058,bassmaster4,2011-07-10 03:24:00,801,next time you go try throwing some x-raps and husky jerks ive done very well with both lures there in silver blue color. Nothing too big but pretty constant action and a lot of fun. Good Luck out there bassmaster4
