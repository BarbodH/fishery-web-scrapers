601231,davey buoy,2011-07-10 22:11:00,5505,"I have a pair of DOEL-FIN tabs to help plane out boat my boat. It's a 86 305 V8 mercruser inboard/outboard. If I install them do they make a noticeable difference?. There the model 185. Thanks for any help in advance, davey."
601233,Terry,2011-07-10 22:15:00,14456,YUP  they will get you up on plane quicker  they will most likely lower your top end by 2 miles per hour
601238,davey buoy,2011-07-10 22:42:00,5505," Thanks Terry, just wasn't sure if it would make that much of a difference. davey."
601249,Terry,2011-07-10 23:12:00,14456,"if you have a boat that gets up quickly you will not see any difference but if you have trouble getting it up, it will make a big difference  but again they do take away some top end from motors that have trim/tilt"
601261,misfish,2011-07-10 23:33:00,29133,"Heres a question for you. I only ask because,the boat I have,the owner never used the trim switch. When I took it out for a test run and used the trim,he said wow,that came on plane fast. Davey, if you like to go for a ride,Im very close.Lets see whats going on."
601336,craigdritchie,2011-07-11 01:54:00,1586,"Doel Fin works best on boats that are underpowered, or otherwise badly set up. As Terry said, they help you plane but eat a bit of top-end speed due to increased drag.  You said the engine is a MerCruiser 305 - what's the boat?"
601409,davey buoy,2011-07-11 07:50:00,5505," It's a Chris Craft scorpion 187. It has great top end, but with 4 guys and their gear fishing it's hard to get on plane. Misfish I use the trim button and the motor is always all the way down when taking off.Two in the boat and she planes within 10 seconds. I am also now running a 19pitch prop instead of a 21 which was very hard to get on plane. It is a 200 hp motor. Thanks for your help. davey"
