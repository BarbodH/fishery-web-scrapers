What a bummer.... I missed the first day of POND SCUM      My FAVOURITE time on this particular water is when it gets all matted up like this .    Topwater frogs are my go to lure out there and sometimes a Texas rigged Senko if I have the patience for it.  I had a lot of blow ups yesterday and a caught a couple of small LM bass.  This one was only about 2-3 lbs but he blew that frog a foot out of the water from below and therefore EARNED A PIC ON OFC  He fought like a trooper for the first few yards,,,,and then it must have opened it's jaw WIIIIDE OPEN because he weighed about 10lbs by the time I got him to shore with all the weeds and scum on him.     Oh well,  I know where they are and I can drag the Sportspal out next weekend."

601347,Dave Bailey,2011-07-11 02:11:00,1641," Darn right, there's NOTHING as cool as a topwater strike!"
601374,mercman,2011-07-11 02:45:00,7054, Looks like ideal LMB Pond Scum  I betcha there are some nice biggys in there Ron
601375,splashhopper,2011-07-11 02:46:00,2931,yep.... pond scum ad topwater explosions through it.... sure beats reeling in a lure and not even knowing if a fish tried to stike it
601405,adolson,2011-07-11 05:19:00,783," I agree! I ignored topwater lures as a kid/teen, but now that I'm older and fishing again, three of my six most-recent keepers (including my first-ever smallmouth, see avatar) were caught on either of my two Hula-Poppers. It's become my favorite lure, though I've only had luck with it in the Montreal River (tried at Sharp Lake tonight, had one strike but didn't hook it - first time trying night-time fishing, too).  I got a frog yesterday, gonna give that some tries soon."
601408,Dave Bailey,2011-07-11 06:30:00,1641," Don't know if it's the lighting in the photo, but that fish looks as if it was raised in toxic waste, painted khaki, hung to dry for a month, rolled in dust, and then run over by a truck. Hope you didn't try eating it!"
601466,adolson,2011-07-11 13:34:00,783, it's sand.  it tasted great.
