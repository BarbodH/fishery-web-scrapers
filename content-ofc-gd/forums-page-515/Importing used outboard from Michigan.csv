601442,RangerGuy,2011-07-11 12:43:00,564,"Hi Everyone,  I'm having trouble finding an answer to this question. I figure this is the place to ask the question  I'm looking at purchacing a used outboard in michigan and am wondering if we are charged tax when bringing a used motor back to Canada."
601452,irishfield,2011-07-11 13:15:00,26272,"We're charged tax bringing anything into Canada ! If you are bringing it across yourself, you can deduct the personal exemption amount for the length of trip and you'll pay tax on the remaining value."
601461,RangerGuy,2011-07-11 13:23:00,564,"Thanks irishfield,  I guess I knew that but hoped I was wrong HAHA!  "
601617,wallyboss,2011-07-11 18:37:00,1095,"Why would he need to pay taxes on a used motor??? We don""t pay taxes when we buy a used motor here."
601623,Bill Shearer,2011-07-11 18:40:00,456,"You do if bought from a retail store, but not privately. Doesn't hold true when bought in the US though. Feds always want their pound of flesh."
601625,BillM,2011-07-11 18:43:00,17367, You'd pay HST on a used motor here if bought from a dealer.  Private party?  No.
601631,grimsbylander,2011-07-11 18:53:00,3016,"Depending on where you bought it in the States, it can be a double hit. If you purchased it from a dealer, you'll pay the state tax and when you declare it at Customs, you'll pay HST. They both want their tax and neither one cares you're paying twice! Just did it on the weekend."
601780,wallyboss,2011-07-11 23:17:00,1095,"Used motor, tell them your buddy gave it to you and throw away the receipt. Motors do not need to be registered with the Gvmnt."
601781,irishfield,2011-07-11 23:18:00,26272,Doubt he wants to spend three days at the border Wallyboss! But if you like the feel of latex....
601790,strik,2011-07-11 23:30:00,175,  LOL ouch pay the tax lol
