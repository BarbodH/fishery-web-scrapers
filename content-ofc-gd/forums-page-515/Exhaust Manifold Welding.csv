601212,edmichit,2011-07-10 20:56:00,145,"Dang, small crack on the manifold, just after the individual pipes come together. Looks to me like it could be welded on the truck. (enough room and in sight) Pretty sure it's a cast part. 2004 Bravada (Vortec 4200 engine) Any one out there make a recommendation on a good welder/weld shop? Midas already told me if they would try, but if they break a bolt......you know the story...   thanks   "
601214,Whitespinnerbait,2011-07-10 21:04:00,2038,A good '' WELDER ''  would grind out the effected area....heat it up with a torch ...And Mig weld it.Right on the truck...  I would take it to a  ( Welding Shop )
601215,aplumma,2011-07-10 21:09:00,6896,Spray some Sea foam om it..... might not fix it but it will never hurt.  Just kidding you can have a welder hit it and be just fine if their is enough metal to weld on.   Art
601251,misfish,2011-07-10 23:19:00,29133,Im going to show your pic to a friend/welders shop. Let you know if it can be done.  You are close to him.
601253,BillM,2011-07-10 23:20:00,17367,"I wouldn't think you'd wanna mig cast iron, braze perhaps."
601259,Whitespinnerbait,2011-07-10 23:28:00,2038, Braze will cracked hours later  Remember Mig welding would be just to '' seal '' the crack and not necessarily be any means of '' support  ''
601262,BillM,2011-07-10 23:34:00,17367,"I'm no welder, I'll take your word for it"
601266,misfish,2011-07-10 23:41:00,29133,"They make cast welding rods for a reason.Mig weld would be a patch job,but will slip off the cast. Brazing is a bandaid,that will last maybe a few days. Need to grind out a V groove and fill with a cast rod. I could do it,but dont have the means too. I,ll get back to you  Tree30eight ASAP."
601267,Bernie,2011-07-10 23:42:00,3190,"Manifolds on todays vehicles are little thicker than a piece of paper. Add a few years of use and there often isn't enough left to weld to. And even if you did manage to get it welded, chances are it won't last long. I'd recommend you bite the bullet and replace it. Check with a company called Dorman and see if they make it. Most auto supply stores can get Dorman product. Good stuff and very reasonable cost. The labour may be another issue. Get an experienced guy to do it as they know how to get out the tough/siezed hardware."
601268,irishfield,2011-07-10 23:44:00,26272,Good old arc welder and a cast rod as Brian states. Even a normal steel rod with the polarity set backwards will do in a bind. Just be prepared for the consequences if it blows thru.. or slag/splatter goes inside the system and in the case of me welding my dozer exhaust that = enough crap to hold a valve open and have the push rod jump the rockers socket. Got lucky it didn't get hit by the piston.  As Bernie points out... if it's cracked chances are there isn't much left to weld due to internal erosion and external rust. On my 6 month old F150 I already brushed the first layer of baked off casting from the manifolds!
601344,edmichit,2011-07-11 02:05:00,145,"  great thanks,"
601358,edmichit,2011-07-11 02:24:00,145,I Really appreciate the feedback guys.
601362,HTHM,2011-07-11 02:27:00,4082,Doesn't that protect it from further rust?
601363,irishfield,2011-07-11 02:28:00,26272,It lifted in a sheet Albert.. one swipe with my hand and it fell off! 4600km
