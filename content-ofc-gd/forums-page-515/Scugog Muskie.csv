601538,BucktownAngler,2011-07-11 16:35:00,582,I've had luck pretty much anywhere on the lake. Orange seems to be the hot color lately.
601539,BucktownAngler,2011-07-11 16:36:00,582,Try orange & black bucktails or orange stalkers/super stalkers
601561,BillM,2011-07-11 17:02:00,17367,I hope the OP has the appropriate gear to deal with those bigguns!  You don't wanna be fishing them with bass gear
601580,craigdritchie,2011-07-11 17:40:00,1586,It's Scugog. There's nothing in there a bass rod won't handle.
601763,peter23,2011-07-11 23:03:00,95,i have never tried scugog but im going to be going next week and im going to try what everyone says and that is black and orange bucktails. good luck!
