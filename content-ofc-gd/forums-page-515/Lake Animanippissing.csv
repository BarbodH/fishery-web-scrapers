594421,curryale,2011-06-20 01:19:00,26,"I have fished the lake quite a bit.  I wouldnt consider it to be a fantastic fishing lake but its not bad.  The lake itself is a very clear water deep lake.  Lots of rock structure - basically no weeds at all in the entire lake.  It has Pike, Walleye, Bass and Lake Trout.  The Walleye are typically caught on live bait rigs on the shoals.  They can be very tricky to catch during the day.  Best bet are at at dawn and dusk.  Lake Trout fishing can be steady.  Downriggers and/or Leadcore Line are the ticket this time of the year.  Prototypical Lake Trout baits work well.   "
594457,Nipfisher,2011-06-20 02:35:00,2449,The shoals and rocks can be deadly. Get a good map if you can. travel slowly if you don't know the lake. Launch is excellent though.

As mentioned water was clear, no weeds, and rocks and humps everywhere. Did see SM Bass. Tried jigging with Gulp minnows, and Strat spoons. Had a couple of hits but fish were faster than me! Lots of Mayflies hatching, and did see fish feeding on the emerges. Beautiful scenery. The flies and mosquitoes were incessant! No wonder Iike Steelhead fishing! Thanks for the help though, especially about the rocks. Needed that spare prop!"
