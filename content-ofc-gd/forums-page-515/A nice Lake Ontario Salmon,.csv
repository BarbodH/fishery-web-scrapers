601463,Joey,2011-07-11 13:24:00,9122," Ramp Troll, now that has a nice ring to it    Spiel, I gotta let him hold my fish once in awhile or he won't want to go anymore"
601273,Joey,2011-07-11 00:07:00,9122,"We decided to head down to the lake today even though the weather was calling for hot and humid weather.  It was actually pretty nice out there, but we did end up putting the stand up tarp on for awhile when the sun was blazing on us.  Otherwise, we had a bit of rain and then it was mostly overcast.  When we arrived at the launch, we were just heading out and heard someone yelling.  Peter, are you stalking us?     We offered him to join us, but he had some chores to take care of so we yakked a bit and then we set off in search of salmon.  Nice to see you again Pete (I think    LOL)     We barely had the first line down and off it went, ziiiiiinnnnnngggggg, Fish On!!!  It was a nice battle and she weighed in at 29 lbs.      The soon to be release.      This always makes us shake our heads.  Its not like Lake Ontario is a small lake and there is no other place to go to get out of the way of other boats.  There was literally no other boats arounds us for miles, yet this guy has to buzz over our lines this close to us     What's up with that??????       Anyhow, we had no other takers for the day and barely marked a thing.  Talking to others at the launch people either did really well or poorly, but tried all different depths.  Guess you just had to be at the right place at the right time.  I did manage to photograph a few birds.  This one was taking a bath.      A beautiful Swan cleaning itself.            I was trying to get a mirror image of this grackle.       This last picture is kind of fuzzy, but does anyone know what kind of duck this is???      Well that was our day.  Shore was much hotter than out on the water.  What a gorgeous day to be out.  Joey"
601276,misfish,2011-07-11 00:16:00,29133,Nice shirt paul  Fish is a bonus.   J nice shots
601279,Terry,2011-07-11 00:23:00,14456,nice fish nice photos  and a boat that works..real nice....LOL  are you trolling with the big motor
601281,Joey,2011-07-11 00:27:00,9122,"  Yes Terry, its quieter than the kicker.  We get a pretty consistent speed out of it into the wind, and then put the kicker down as a kind of drift sock when we're going with the wind, works perfect  Thans B & T."
601288,alphaalpha,2011-07-11 00:43:00,475,beauty fish!  you guys dont have tickets for the GOSD?  might've been in the money...  -AA
601292,Joey,2011-07-11 00:50:00,9122," Ya, we do the same thing every year, figure we won't get out there often enough and then when we do go, we get a big gal and didn't buy a ticket.  Figures"
601295,irishfield,2011-07-11 00:53:00,26272,Peter's been stalking Paul for a long time Hun !  Nice fish on a scorcher of a day!
601296,Joey,2011-07-11 00:57:00,9122," Ya, I figured, gonna have to get a restraining order  Thanks hon!  Hope you enjoyed your walkies today, and brewskies"
601301,Pikeslayer,2011-07-11 01:05:00,1443," Hey Joey, Awesome fish and nice upgrade for team 2. As for the GOSD tickets, i dont buy them anymore as i have too many guests on the boat and sure as shootin, i know I'd land a prize fish with non ticket holders on board (disqualified). BTW, Where do you guys launch from? I'm out of PC 2-4 times a week.  Cheers, Slayer"
601303,corvette1,2011-07-11 01:13:00,1765,awesome king congrats
601305,Joey,2011-07-11 01:17:00,9122," Ya, I don't think everyone should have to buy a ticket if they are just on your boat enjoying a day of fishing.  Oh, and since I'm on Team 5 and already have bigger salmon, I think team 2 will have to fend for themselves  We usually launch out of Oakville."
601317,BillM,2011-07-11 01:32:00,17367,"Wow Joey, that's a pig!  Awesome pics as well"
601320,Grimace,2011-07-11 01:34:00,2020,Great fish!!  My father and I opted out of the tourny this year as well.  We will probably catch a monster and feel ill about it for the rest of our lives. lol
601335,highdrifter,2011-07-11 01:51:00,2534,Beauties!!  And the salmskie ain't too shabby neither.  That last one looks to be an immature grebe..
601338,Joey,2011-07-11 01:58:00,9122,"  Thanks Fidel, I don't think I've ever seen a grebe before, cool!"
601342,mercman,2011-07-11 02:03:00,7054,What a slammer of a fish  I`d love get into one of those some day. That is definately a Grebe.  Thanks for the pics.  BTW Hows yer pink Teenie              That will get them all talking eh...
601343,Dave Bailey,2011-07-11 02:03:00,1641,"Yep, Red-necked grebe, Podiceps grisegena. There are some that breed in Bronte Harbour each year. They're not related to ducks, closer to loons. Nice fish too!"
601352,Joey,2011-07-11 02:18:00,9122,"  Oh man, I agree!!    Oh shoot Paul, I forgot to thank you for that.  It's awesome, and fits in my purse  So Thank You!!!"
601368,green&orange,2011-07-11 02:35:00,31,"Wow, those Lake O salmon are nice.  What I would do to catch a 29 pounder over here in Lake Michigan.  Great fish."
601395,Roy,2011-07-11 03:49:00,13728,"Fantastic, guys!"
601410,Jewelbee,2011-07-11 08:23:00,422,Nice fish!!! LOVE the photos Joey. You are getting good with that camera!
601413,lew,2011-07-11 09:39:00,12766,A huge fish & some great bird pics.  Fun times guys !!
601434,johnnyb,2011-07-11 12:25:00,3413,"Gorgeous fish!  Gotta love being out on the lake on these calm, hot days...makes it hard to come back to shore"
601436,Spiel,2011-07-11 12:34:00,9065,   Nice of you to let Paul hold your fish.
601444,BITEME,2011-07-11 12:49:00,1968,STALKER!!!!!! I'm hurt Ramp Troll ....sure Pier Rat ....good with that Stalker  Very nice fish!!!!! at least someone is getting them if I go out and wash lures again im going to hand in my man card. As always it was good to see you guys again  Peter
