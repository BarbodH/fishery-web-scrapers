601544,John,2011-07-11 16:49:00,2956,I'm sure that this is a simple solution.............. bear in mind I am very technically challenged. I have a new laptop running Windows 7. When I am logged into OFC and click to a new page I get thrown out and have to log in again......next page same thing..............
601546,Roy,2011-07-11 16:52:00,13728,Did you forget to mail your cheque John? I haven't received anything yet.

601570,ChrisK,2011-07-11 17:09:00,2772, Carol told me to do it
601572,John,2011-07-11 17:15:00,2956," Do I remember a little conversation that went something like.......""what happens at Lakair,stays at Lakair""..........things are becoming all fuzzy, can't remember what I said to who now............."
601673,ChrisK,2011-07-11 20:40:00,2772,Hey now John...This isn't a Lakair related issue
