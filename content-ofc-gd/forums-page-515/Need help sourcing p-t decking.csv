601459,Headhunter,2011-07-11 13:23:00,5703,"Hey guys, I'm hoping some one in the know could provide some insight for me... I am having to replace the deck boards on my deck at home... unfortunately because of the design of the deck, I will need 6 2x6x18ft boards to properly repair the damage time and weather has put on it. Does anyone know where I could source such lumber? Thanks for your consideration! HH"
601475,HTHM,2011-07-11 13:47:00,4082,"18's are difficult to get, I would suggest using 6 8 footers and 6 10 footers with staggered joints. An alternate method of restoring it is to rent a sander and sand the deck down. Any lumber yard will have the sizes I mentioned."
601476,muskymike,2011-07-11 13:49:00,772,Where are you located?

601487,Headhunter,2011-07-11 14:20:00,5703,"Scarborough/Pickering boarder I don't want to use shorter boards as the decking boards add to the structural integrity of the deck. It is held up by four posts, that have a frame that the boards sit on. HH"
601492,lew,2011-07-11 14:27:00,12766,"Any thoughts to the composite boards Joe ??  Kinda spendy but will last forever, come in different colours and may be available in the 18'ers your looking for."
601526,Headhunter,2011-07-11 16:06:00,5703,"I considered it Lew, but based on cost, it looks like 3-4 times more expensive and that's not in the cards right now. Thanks for your consideration though... HH"
601529,Spiel,2011-07-11 16:17:00,9065,"Many years back now Joe I built a deck using 2""X6""X18' PT boards that I sourced through Rona Cashway.  Not sure if that helps."
