The water looks like its down over a foot and a half right now and the weed beds are coming up everywhere... really hard to get into the good spots with an electric motor right now. I'll be in my brand new 2011 Lund Rebel XL SS, black... if you are going.. I'll see you there"

601450,johnnyb,2011-07-11 13:14:00,3413,So how did you do?  Only reading this now....my go-to tactic would have been weedless surface baits in the thick stuff....curious to hear how you made out
601712,Toddyc20,2011-07-11 21:23:00,141,I was also in the tournament and ended up with a 3lb 0oz bucket but not even close to the leader.  Last I saw the leader was 4.66lbs.  I'm curious to hear how you made out also Flash.  I think I saw your boat.  Did you have 4 people on the boat?  Good looking boat for sure.
