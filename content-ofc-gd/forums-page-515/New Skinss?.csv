601674,NAW,2011-07-11 20:41:00,4022,What the heck.  OFC has totally changed.  What happened to my old skin?
601676,TJQ,2011-07-11 20:43:00,7806,"Were in the process of making a few changes, most things should remain the same, a few logo and name changes mainly."
601677,TJQ,2011-07-11 20:45:00,7806,The skins should be fine... which one were you using???
601678,NAW,2011-07-11 20:48:00,4022,The green one.. Not sure what it was called.
601679,misfish,2011-07-11 20:49:00,29133,"My blue skin still works. Boss, dont you push the red button. That red button is no good.   Looking forward to the new changes you were talking about."
601683,Bill Shearer,2011-07-11 20:52:00,456,"I can get used to almost anything, but really did like the green one much better. Can I get it back.....please?"
601684,BillM,2011-07-11 20:54:00,17367, On the bottom left of the page you should see two pulldown boxes.  You want to use the left box and select 'club'.  That will get you back to the old green/brown board profile.
601685,NAW,2011-07-11 20:55:00,4022,"OK.  Somethin fishy goin on here.  When I changed my skin, it kicked me out and I had to log back in.  Now it keeps kicking me out.  I was able to change my skin back to ""club"", so that good.  Lets see if this post will work, I tried a few minutes ago, and it kicked me out when I hit send."
601686,TJQ,2011-07-11 20:55:00,7806,Just select the club skin in the lower left handcornerr... if theres any other problems keep posting them and we will get them worked out.
601688,misfish,2011-07-11 20:58:00,29133,"Changed my skin to see, and booted me out.Thank god I write my user name down."
601690,NAW,2011-07-11 20:59:00,4022,"Looks like it's working for me now.  Not getting kicked out anymore, and I got the Club skinn back!"
601693,Terry,2011-07-11 21:04:00,14456,you leave my skin alone    I'm just saying..LOL
601695,TJQ,2011-07-11 21:04:00,7806,I think is cause were moving to a new doamin name.... it ill likely ask everyone to log back in and pick a new skin.  http://ontariofishingcommunity.com
601697,Terry,2011-07-11 21:06:00,14456,yup  I had to log back in
601698,misfish,2011-07-11 21:06:00,29133,"  I know some new skin I would like,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"
601699,vinnimon,2011-07-11 21:07:00,2593,"the brown skin is working now, im not a chameleon lol. Blue skin is too bland for me. I prefer the rustic look, the same happened at a local bait shop that moved recently. Rustic to bland."
601715,lew,2011-07-11 21:26:00,12766,"I was OK on the main page, but when I opened a thread it was blue & white and told me I had to log in, even though I was already. Anyhoo, it all seems good again now.  Jeeeez, I thought I pushed another wrong button somewhere"
601719,misfish,2011-07-11 21:31:00,29133, Lew  You nipping into that bottle Diane won again.
601727,Roy,2011-07-11 21:48:00,13728,"It's just a pause for station identification folks. Grab a drink, a few pretzels and we'll be back to our regularly scheduled programming. "
601729,misfish,2011-07-11 21:52:00,29133,Theres a past.
601753,vinnimon,2011-07-11 22:48:00,2593,
