600500,singingdog,2011-07-08 10:08:00,1047,"Strange bite: the big ones came on a topwater over 17-20 of open water after completly ignoring jerkbaits. They would just slurp it down, almost like a trout rise.    "
600501,SmokestackLightnin,2011-07-08 10:19:00,390,"Nice fish, first one is a largie"
600583,EC1,2011-07-08 14:37:00,930,Nicely done! 17-20FOW with a topwater! Sounds awesome!
600603,bucktail,2011-07-08 15:25:00,1857,"Nice catch , I have heard its a hard strange bite up there from a few peole fishing for bass. maybe a big year class of cisco's is drawing them out to the deep water early this year."
600604,BillM,2011-07-08 15:51:00,17367,"Had a similar bite on the French the past few days..  In the morning they were slamming spinnerbaits, once that died off, it was a topwater frenzy!!!  Can't complain though."
600630,coreyhkh,2011-07-08 16:45:00,163,The bass are not biting good in Muskoka/ Haliburton they are not where they should be.    
600637,BillM,2011-07-08 16:49:00,17367, They are hitting just fine.  Switch up your techniques.
600715,singingdog,2011-07-08 20:04:00,1047,"    It's definitely a different year. Deep weedlines are not ver well established on the lakes I am fishing. Smallies seem to be more open-water oriented. LM seem to be all over the place: super-tight against shore, on the flats, on the edges of drops...."
600785,fishboy,2011-07-09 00:16:00,550,"As of last weekend, the Haliburtonhttp:// bass still hadn't established a regular pattern on our lakes either.  I got some on topwater, some on tubes rigged weightless, some on spinnerbaits and none on bottom, anywhere from 8' to 18'.  Here's a typical one"
600828,craigdritchie,2011-07-09 01:32:00,1586,"First bass is definitely a largemouth, not a smallie.  Bass fishing has been pretty awesome everywhere so far. Lots of water in the spring, and now warm stable weather .... can't ask for better."
600840,Jigger,2011-07-09 02:05:00,1237,"Nice fish singingdog! Cant say ive had great luck this year. Did hook into a few nice fish, but seem to be caught in the deathspin of unpinned fish. Did lose a slurper over some deep water tonight. Hopefully this weekend produces. Like Craig said, this stable weather should be just the ticket. Thanks for the report!"
600841,lunkerbasshunter,2011-07-09 02:05:00,2585,was up in marten river area for opener and had 100 fish days.  Hit lake muskoka on the way home for a quick hour or 2 fish and caught 8 or 9 in th 2 lbs range.  Seems like bass fishing is great this year so far in my world.  Walleye fishing is a different story for me lol  ANyway first pic is a largie.  Thanks for the pics and report.  Must be awesome top water fishing in a kayak!  Cheers!
601460,johnnyb,2011-07-11 13:23:00,3413,"Beautiful fish.  And uhh....the first one's a largie   (I'm sure you knew that)  I fish close to Minden, and have had the fish destroy surface lures one year, and ignore them the next...even though I still see them hitting bait hard at the surface.  I think they get really picky about what they're feeding on.  The challenge this year is going to be chasing them around on the main lake on calm days.  Caught a nice one last year on a surface bait over 120FOW...and had a few beasts following jerkbaits in...just gotta hone that technique a bit"
601468,Harrison,2011-07-11 13:36:00,2202,"Cool thanks for the info.  Wierd bite for sure, Mr largie's eating on the other side of the tracks where they should be.  Interesting bite too, just slurping it.  I would assume the lake was glass or close too it.  I guess the pics display that too huh.. haha..  Why pass up the jerk and eat the topwater.. wierd, I guess it's what bugged them the most."
