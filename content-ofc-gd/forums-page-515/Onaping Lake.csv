377473,ohhenrygsr,2009-08-28 18:32:00,947,We've only caught over 200 fish in a week between the 4-6 of us each year.  If you need guidance i might be able to help you out LOL.  Pm me
377504,gdelongchamp,2009-08-28 20:51:00,199,A nice lake. An excellent public access at the south end of the lake. Good ramp facility for any size boat. Most of the fishing is done midway and at the north end of the lake. A lot of islands so it's a good idea to have lots of gas onboard and a good map or GPS.  The lake is at least 30 miles long. Some boulders to watch for in some of the narrows further north so bring a depth finder.  A lot of people who fish there also stay at Halfway Lake prov park. A nice park and a nice little lake but the action is slow in Halfway. Fish Onaping or the smaller lakes north of the park. We fished Genevra lake this summer just south of Onaping with good luck on smallies.  I think Onaping is a good producing lake but it's a big lake so you'll have to work at finding the fish.  Good luck
