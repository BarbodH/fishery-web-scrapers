601224,Bass Assassin,2011-07-10 21:57:00,23,Im looking for a place to go fishing with a kayak in Hamilton Stoney Creek or Burlington area. I have been to a couple conservation areas a found that most of the places had samll or almost no fish. If some one could suggest to me a good place to go where there is good fishing that would be great.
