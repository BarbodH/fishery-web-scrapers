Instead of going to your local Service Canada office and coming out 15 minutes later with a boat license, you now have to send the info to New Brunswick and wait for them to send it back. I spoke to a woman there today and she said they're very busy and cannot maintain the 5 day turnaround times which are posted on their website. Most likely 2 weeks!! Oh and make sure you don't use the boat...nice. Anyone know a workaround for this?"

601636,grimsbylander,2011-07-11 18:57:00,3016,  Thanks Scugog...I guess I should have mentioned I bought the boat in the States and therefore it has no prior registration. I'm out of luck I guess. It's still worth it considering what I saved. Thanks!
