601457,mike rousseau,2011-07-11 13:22:00,4661,well i started off the day trying some new spots for musky... i planned to focus on rocks and basins... i ended up trolling a basin for a while as well as a big stone pile with no success... the i tried some shallow wood... nothing but an accidental largie... so i thought i would try a nice point that holds walleye and smallies... and BAM... 52 incher!!!   now my day is made...   then we combed the area looking for others... nothing... so we headed to a weedbed that usually holds fish... we werent sure if they were on yet cause my friend in another boat was there for 3-5 hours in the morning with nothing but a follow... so we tried... after 4 passes trolling BAM... 38 incher on the fifth pass... now its turning into a really good day and the smiles are ear to ear...  ...we decide to try another close by weedbed that has a nice steep bank... first pass BAM... 36 incher... now im floored... all these fish were caught within a 2-3 hour span... later we also got a 6 and 10lb pike and a mid 40 inch musky follow... all and all... great day on the water...
