Top guy indeed, we booked for 5 hrs and as we were not getting alot of fish, he stayed out for nearly 7 hrs.  We managed alot of farm animals, infact that was all that was hitting for awhile. Then we got what he called a small bow (5 lb), hell if I caught that in the Maitland I would not describe it as small  :rofl2:  Missed a few and then very late in the trip, bang rod goes off, and I'll see if I can get this right, this beauty hit an orange crush 40ft down, 120 back on the slider?????!!!!!!!!! Yeah   It weighed in at 10lbs, I ain't a particularly small person. I gave the fish to my girlfriends mum. I think she loves me a little bit more than she did before.  Cheers Doug."
