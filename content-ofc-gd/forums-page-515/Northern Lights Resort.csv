Has anyone been to the ""Northern Lights Resort"" just south of North Bay? Is the place nice?  Also, how was the fishing? The website indicates that the fishing is great but I wanted to see I anyone has first hand experience?  Any help is much appreciated!"

I would recommend that you dine on the water at Old Mirror Lodge,foods good,view is great and it is only 10 min by boat(no road access) from Northern Lights. If you want we can hook up and I will show you ALL the good spots,I am just down the river near Port loring. I am away today and not back till 7 or so tonite,if you want the 50cent tour pick a time and date and post it and I will be there.Being retired is great.   vance"

Wasn't a spa back then, just a cottage resort. The fishn for walleye was pretty good. You can catch em off the dock in the evening. If your out on the water look for beaver lodges and fish em. You will catch all kinds of fish. Good luck  Kuha"
