15025,irishfield,2006-12-22 04:58:00,26272,Yah thats my Tinny Mike. I guess my photoshop skills aren't that good (or should I say I know they're not) but I tried to put a fishing hole in the boat for you!
15027,Mike the Pike,2006-12-22 05:03:00,3421,The good thing with you is if you put a hole in her your all equipped to fix it rivets aluminium etc.....its going to be a long winter if mother nature can't decide what to give us .Maybe we will have to go to Denver for some ice fishing 60cm of snow.
15028,irishfield,2006-12-22 05:11:00,26272,Even Lake Temagami is wide open. The entire North end and hub area is wide open. Still boating the lake. The elders on Bear Island have never seen open water this late in the year.

15034,verno,2006-12-22 07:12:00,178,"If you are gonna put a hole in the bottom to fish through, you have to remember that water is gonna come in, so you have to punch another hole further back to let the water out."
15115,irishfield,2006-12-22 16:00:00,26272,  LOL verno...that's why I made the hole the height of the gunnels. No water will come in!
