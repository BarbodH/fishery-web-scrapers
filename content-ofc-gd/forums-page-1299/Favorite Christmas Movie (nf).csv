Favorite movies are: Christmas Story - fa ra ra ra rah, rah rah rah rah!!! Die Hard! ""sure come out to the coast, we'll get together and have a great old time"" Classic! HH"

14112,fishergirl72,2006-12-19 17:42:00,455,"LOL, yeah that was a good movie too bucktail."
14115,huey graphite,2006-12-19 17:48:00,362,It's a Wonderful Life is my favorite. Jimmy Stewart was one of the all-time greats.  Christmas Vacation hands down the best Christmas comedy. Randy Quaid's performance was incredible.

14213,Pigeontroller,2006-12-19 21:41:00,2793,"A Christmas Story, all time favorite. I really like Elf now too.  I'm not a huge Jim Carrey fan but I think his ""Grinch"" is ""Briliant""!  Parts of A Christmas Story were filmed here in St Catharines! The School is on Niagara St. just south of the QEW.  Another xmas movie I like that I haven't seen in awhile is, ""An American Christmas Carol"" with Henry Winkler, anyone seem it, made in 1979. Winkler is Benedict Slade, a 'Scrooge' living in depression era New England.  "
14309,tomO,2006-12-20 01:09:00,363,I always enjoyed  It's a wonderful life
14316,fishing n autograph,2006-12-20 01:21:00,2540,Here's my picks  1) Christmas Vacation 2) A Christmas Story 3) Scrooged 4) Garfields Xmas 5) Muppets Christmas Carole

14438,Rich Clemens,2006-12-20 11:22:00,3131,Christmas Vacation ... hands down.
14729,Basspro,2006-12-21 03:08:00,11,I must be really old fashioned...I still like to see Laurel & Hardys 'March of the Wooden Soldiers'  and 'How the Grinch Stole Christmas'.
14750,ChrisK,2006-12-21 03:46:00,2772,"I beleive the name of the show was""Mirical On 34 Street""  Cheers !!"
14829,Motorhead,2006-12-21 15:32:00,163,"My favorite X-mas movie has to be ""Bad Santa"" with Billy-Bob Thorton... Not for kids but very very funny....  Doug"
14833,urbanangler1990,2006-12-21 16:10:00,933,"haha Bad Santa was a halarious movie, but my fav would have to be Christmas Vacation."
14842,setomonkey,2006-12-21 16:54:00,872,"Christmas Story, hands-down. Some classic scenes.  Mike"
15098,duber,2006-12-22 15:32:00,220,Trailer Park Boys Christmas is my favorite   .But then again I am easily amused
13977,steve_paul,2006-12-19 12:31:00,658,"Just wondering  For me, love watching Christmas Vacation while we put the tree up.  Seems to get funnier every time I watch it.  What is your favorite????"
13979,Dutch,2006-12-19 12:37:00,831,A Christmas Story - hands down.  Funniest scene ever is when Santa pushes Ralphie (the pink nightmare) down the slide with a boot to the forehead.  It's a classic.  I watch it every year.
13980,PERCHER,2006-12-19 12:40:00,787,I second Christmas Vacation.
13981,DanTheMan,2006-12-19 12:41:00,257,"I agree, the best and funniest x-mas movie ever  "
13982,Whopper,2006-12-19 12:44:00,2174,"Christmas Vacation for our family. I think we have went thru two vhs tapes and now we have the cd. A true classic.  ""He was a beastly man""  Whopper"
13984,ccmtcanada,2006-12-19 12:48:00,7971,"My personal favourite is Christmas Story...soooo many classic moments....  - The swearing scene with no discernable words - The trying to walk in the snowsuit scene - ""You're gonna shoot yer eye out"" - The broken lamp - Christmas Duck at the Chinese restaurant  And lots more!!!  Recently though with our 4 year old, it's been great fun seeing her enjoy all the classic kids movies...the ones that I grew up with."
13988,bpsbassman,2006-12-19 12:59:00,941,"Christmas Story. For an old guy like me, its not only funny, but reminiscent of another time when I was growing up."

13999,lew,2006-12-19 13:33:00,12767," Same with me Roger, I was a kid in the 50's, same as in the movie and can almost see myself in that show.  I had  a BB gun (but didn't shoot my eye out), drank Ovaltine and am pretty sure I had the same snowsuit as the little guy and I couldn't climb outta the snowbanks either........always great memories of a better era everytime I watch it  Christmas Vacation is also a favorite that I watch every year"

14005,ccmtcanada,2006-12-19 13:42:00,7971,Did everyone hear that someone bought the house that was used in the Christmas Story and spent a bunch of cash restoring it back to what it looked like when the movie was shot?  They also bought the house across the street for use as a gift shop....  They are now doing tours of the house....here's the link....  http://www.achristmasstoryhouse.com/
14006,steve_paul,2006-12-19 13:45:00,658," Remember he got it changed to plastic - kept peeing his pants when his wife used the microwave     ""Sh***ers Full Clark""  2 Christmas Movies I have never seen - A Christmas Story and Miracle on 34th Street.  Will have to rent them both this week."
14008,jediangler,2006-12-19 13:46:00,1923,"My new fave is ELF. Ed Asner makes a great Santa, James Caan is the perfect Scrooge and Will Ferrell is awesome as the extra large Elf."

14044,Peter Panfish,2006-12-19 15:18:00,46,"Id say either that stop motion Rudolph the Red Nose Reindeer, with the yeti and the guy from the yukon and all, or home alone. Both of those are the best."
14047,steve_paul,2006-12-19 15:25:00,658," Zack, welcome to the board.  Forgot about Home Alone 1 and 2 - both great Christmas movies too.  That kid had some great ideas lol.  Elf too - laugh almost non stop through the whole thing, Will Ferrell is perfect in that role.  ""You stink like Beef and Cheese""  (I may watch too many Christmas movies lol   )"
14048,Nemo,2006-12-19 15:27:00,727,A Christmas Carol - 1951 adaptation of Charles Dickens story starring Alastair Sim is a classic as well.  
14051,dustink,2006-12-19 15:31:00,526,"   Eddie: I don't know, Clark.  I don't think I should should be going down no hill with nothing between me and the ground but a piece of cheap Governrment plastic.    Clark: Ya' think it matters Eddie?      That movie IS Christmas for me!  It's one we watch every Christmas Eve at my folks house....recite every line, and laugh more and more each year!    .....""we're going to have the hap, hap, happiest Christmas since Bing Crosby danced with Danny ******* Kay!"""
14053,Hooked,2006-12-19 15:33:00,891,"Definately A Christmas Story.  I was lucky enough to watch it at the theatres when I was a kid, ever lasting memory.  Great flick."
14054,motv8tr,2006-12-19 15:35:00,2587,"I enjoy a few movies, but I'd have to say my all time favorite is ""White Christmas"", for me it just sets the mood, sadly it doesn't seem to get aired as much these days.  I do like Christmas Vacation though.  I also liked ""The Polar Express"", the animation on that was great.  Maureen"
14056,steve_paul,2006-12-19 15:39:00,658, That's the best version of Christmas Carol.  Gotta like Bill Murray in Scrooged though too.  Mo - White Christmas was my mom's favorite along with Bells of St. Mary's - those two were on every Christmas growing up.
