15591,Beans,2006-12-24 01:12:00,3339,Nice report with photos Tom...  At least we can live vicariously through your reports until we have ice of our own...
15596,Terry,2006-12-24 01:34:00,14456,"I have read this thread 3 times but I am so envious, I just don't know what to say...  wish I was there, great report.."
15599,tjsa,2006-12-24 01:42:00,1578,"thanks crappiesteve and Beans, and I know you are hurting Terry."
15604,fishdawg,2006-12-24 02:12:00,912," your not alone bud!  ""had to use hand auger, only 9""s of ice!"" wish we had that problem!!!"
15777,tjsa,2006-12-24 17:32:00,1578," Yeah, big problem, lol, having to use the hand augers. Well, didn't have to, just that we went out with minimal gear, for a short time. And we knew the ice was not that thick.  No room for the gas powered auger head box and drill without using my 8 ft. sleigh, but it would not fit with my quad on the back of my truck, my buds smaller sleigh would. We managed to slide it sideways up front of the quad in the back of my pickup, with the rest of the gear beside the quad, and under it, lol."
15578,tjsa,2006-12-24 00:38:00,1578,"Thanks MrEh..........I think, lol  Yes Campet, I believe this is the 2nd actual ice fishing report, someone had one 2 weeks ago from somewhere down south, but that ice is probably gone now.  FinS, I charged up the rechargable batteries last night, and had a full set ready to go just in case.  Mo, I am not completely recovered, it is a virus that will just not let go, lots of people up here that I know have it, it hits everyone differently, but I had to get out of the house and do something, and this was a perfect opportunity. Geez, hand bombing holes through the ice is hard now(god, I am getting old, lol), haven't really done it in years. And the blades on my auger are not honed perfectly any more, lol. Have one of those manual hand held sharpeners, but they are definately no replacement for proper honing. Good thing there was only 9 inches of ice. Our hand augers are old school technology compared to some available today, both of them are probably 30 yrs. old. I know I have owned my folding 8"" since grade 11, or 1976(it has 7"" blades on it right now), my buds is a slightly newer vintage.  Mike the Pike, I am up in Thunder Bay, Ontario. Lots of the lakes up here are frozen over, but some of the larger, deeper lake trout lakes are still forming ice. They have ice, but have big open areas on them. The lake I was fishing was actually a border lake with the US, but its mean depth is only 10 ft. at best, and I do not know of any depth deeper in this lake. And with the low water levels this year, we were fishing in at most 7 ft. of water."
15581,tjsa,2006-12-24 00:51:00,1578," Clampet, until I joined this site, I had never, ever, heard of using a sapling referred to as a Gad. Its just a young willow branch to me, supple, and reactive, have used them since I was 10, and that is going back some years, lol. We refer to it as the ""finnish"" method of fishing, since there is a quite large Finnish population up here. My bud is a ""finook"", finnish/ukranian mix. Another bud is the same, but reversed. I am just a run of the mill wasp with british heritage, lol."
15583,Rattletrap2,2006-12-24 00:54:00,1652,"Tom, I always thought you lived here in Ontario like a lot of us..... but your report clearly depicts a trip to some foreign land where the water actually freezes over? LOL  Looks like you had a nice day and a few nice fish to top it off.  Thanks for a peek at what we can only dream about. Hope you are feeling better real soon as well."
15585,tjsa,2006-12-24 01:02:00,1578," I do indeed live in Ontario, but up in the great white north of Ontario."
15588,crappiesteve,2006-12-24 01:07:00,220,"..thats great ,at least you got to go icefishingTom.personnaly I can,t wait myself. High five to you bud,my time will come,in the mean time ,have yourself a great holiday season.  Steve"
