14883,fishergirl72,2006-12-21 20:51:00,455,Well here is a picture of my new niece. Her name is Deanna. My brother-in-law just started his 2 week leave from Afganhistan and he got home just in time to be there for the birth of his first child. She weighed in at 5 lbs 11 oz. I could have not asked for a better christmas gift and this is going to be a christmas two remember. At least the daddy can spend his 2 weeks with his daughter before he goes back on his tour.
