Hope everyone has safe a happy holidays!  I still have two tournament reports left to write including the summary of the disaster that required me to need to buy a new bass boat.  Will try to write it up over the holidays to provide some vicarious entertainment (at my expense) in the new year while you wait for the water to get hard!  Peace,  Charles"

15149,charlesn,2006-12-22 16:40:00,551,"Don't worry Brian, the 2nd console will be going in sometime in the spring.  I'm nothing if not considerate towards my passengers.  (IOW, sit down, shut up and hold on for dear life!).  lol  BPSman, I met the gentleman in Tennessee.  Took the boat out on Old Hickory Lake.  The fishing was slow, but the boat was fantastic.  You can read about our trip on JP DeRose's Blog on the WFN website.  Thanks for the kind words and happy birthday.  Charles"
