I wish my kids have a fantastic Xmas! this is the first year that they are really getting it, Santa/presents, that is. Just been too young until this year to really grasp what's going on. For myself, I only want one, ok, maybe two more days on Quinte before ice. I think I've bribed the ""Warden"" well enough with presents, so... we'll see if all the stars align and I can break free for a day or two. Oh yah, I want peace in the world yada, yada, yada! HH"
