15199,snagmaster,2006-12-22 19:39:00,250,Woodro and I hit Quinte yesterday. We arrived at the launch at 7 and were on the water by 730...The conditions looked good .A brisk 25km wind from the west  but we had a high pressure system that moved in over night that was our downfall we predict....we trolled from dusk to dawn with all the usual techniques and baits with not even a sniff. Iceguy  was also out on the water and trolled all day as well and only got one three pound eye. This is my second time out on Quinte this fall and I havent hooked a fish yet...I guess I have bad luck on lake O...lol. Im hopefully going to be heading out with iceguy one last time after boxing day....I wont give up until i hook a monster  Quinte eye.  ps....hows perchin been on cooks and jacksons point?
15220,cisco,2006-12-22 20:54:00,597,I was out on Tuesday and Wednesday except when too rough. I did well with around 10 fish of all sizes and fished east of the ferry crossing in the middle and more to the north side. Used 5 and at midday 6 colour leadcore with CC blue/silver shads and on the planers 220 ft back using green/orange Manns stretch divers and the RR Barbie. Trolled around 1. to 1.7mph.  Hope you have better luck next time!

15466,setomonkey,2006-12-23 18:32:00,872,"Sounds like it can be tough, but when it's on it can really be on (from some recent BOQ reports)  With this mild weather you might get another chance this year...  Mike"
15476,Carp,2006-12-23 18:59:00,1488,"Don't sweat a ""no fish"" day. I've had my share too.  Keep after them and as said already, one day you'll be into a bunch of hogs."
