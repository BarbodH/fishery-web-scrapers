There has been times in the past when plant shut downs were scheduled on Xmas, but it was optional and I always passed. And I got lucky with work next week. They closed the shop until after new years and I have a UI claim going since last fall, so I'll be getting paid courtesy of of federal government. How sweet is that???"

Since no one wanted to work those days the wife and I would as it was very dollar wise to do so.  As years passed we backed off on Christmas day.  Since retiring 7 years ago I have done and continue to do a lot of different jobs but vowed I would never work holidays again.  I have to admit however that if it were not for the grandkids I would find Christmas day boring."

They even broke down and left us leave early this past Friday.  Four days off, work three, and then annother three day week-end.  I could get used to that ... if the pay stayed the same.   Pray for those who do have to work to be safe and bring some Christmas spirit back home to their families."
