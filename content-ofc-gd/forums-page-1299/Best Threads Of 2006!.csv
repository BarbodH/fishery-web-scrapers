14702,FishFinder,2006-12-21 00:47:00,481,THe old OFC used to be up so you can see old posts but now it just goes to the proboards main site.
14703,danc,2006-12-21 00:47:00,4677," There's no such thing as OFC. Welcome to the new and improved OFC!!  And... like the others have said, Moosebunks posts and awesome photography are top notch. I feel like I'm right there with him as I read along. One of these days I'll be in one of his stories. That would be an honor. MB and I have a lot in common. Too much to mention here. I'm sure that we'll get along just fine when we meet, and even better after I introduce him to that 24 inch Brook Trout that he's been waiting to catch. He is an incredible asset to OFC."
14713,Pete Maina,2006-12-21 01:35:00,213,"HI,  Well, I got PM from Crazyhook ... now I ""get it"".  (Lew, I know what I'm gonna try to get you to do next time I see you  )  It's OK Fishergirl ... hmmm, guess that means you been reading ... you didn't think any of those outfits were funny at all ... right.  "
14740,ehg,2006-12-21 03:23:00,2666,"The report on the 57"" and 58"" muskies brought into Marc Thorpes boat were pretty darn good! Also the report on all the other 50""+ muskies caught in his boat early this past summer wasn't shabby either. Might have totalled 10,000 page views between them.  Snag's scottish salmon post was hilarous! As well as the little note from Crazyhook to ChrisS was pretty funny. You know what i'm taliking about CH  cheers"
14745,ChrisK,2006-12-21 03:30:00,2772," I agree with Cliff all the way on this one.....Snag,your the man buddy !!!!And from what I here he still hasn't called ya  Cheers !!!"
14770,Smokey,2006-12-21 04:49:00,1278,As with every year one of my favorite reports to watch for is Ron's trip North to Nip. Always lots of great pics.
14773,camillj,2006-12-21 05:10:00,1988,Who am I to be a trend setter .... I'll triple the Moosebunk vote
14776,Nemo,2006-12-21 05:34:00,727,I liked the TEP/Spiel/DanC/Mahumba/Sis  Brook Trout and Forest Fire Post.
14793,Marc Thorpe,2006-12-21 12:42:00,621,"Actually there's no favorite for me,mainly because the reports and pics that folks share is what keeps me intrigued Moosebunk,Dip Lip to name  few that make it a complete report/story but there is so many,the pics by Danc and Ron portray the most beautiful aspects of nature being shared.these are only references,there are so many,The  pics of fish and how to's from GCD and The plumma's which always have something to learn EHG,I think the Bedarf fish set an entire internet record of most view on one site which was just shy of 10 000 hits,just shy when factoring how many sites posted the link, it may have very well been between 15 000 and 20 000 views or impressions,It was truly a unique moment in the history of muskie fishing and one that will mum me for ever Wait the show comes out in January"
14820,fishergirl72,2006-12-21 14:37:00,455,Right Pete  I think those outfits are absolutely dashing on you!
14836,Puckhead,2006-12-21 16:26:00,377,Anything by Moosebunk has my vote!
14958,tomO,2006-12-22 00:59:00,363,I kinda liked the thread on the broke back river system.
15024,Mike the Pike,2006-12-22 04:52:00,3421,Well for me I missed out on some of the great threads some of you spoke about.  For me is when Dano lost his lovely lady avatar.  Terry and his amazing computer skills made me laugh when he censored those wiggly things with his white banner written censored.LOL  
15236,Moosebunk,2006-12-22 21:32:00,3970,"A few favorites of the year would be Dano's Kesagami trip with his father, DanC's hosting and brook/lake trout extravaganza (lol) on Nipigon, and Sandy and KC's sturgeon trips.  There were numerous other great reports over the year, but right for the moment it's those that stick out because I love pike and Kesagami, brookies and sturgeon. lol.  A fella that goes by Phishfinder who may not be a poster here is one who I look out for.  Spirit of adventure and the telling of the tale are his specialities.  A good number of folks here should give themselves a big pat on the back.  Quite a year for catches, memories and online posts.  Keep at it gang, as there's no better entertainment than a steady stream of people reporting their fishing experiences as they live them."
15308,Dano,2006-12-23 01:57:00,719,"The guy right above me here. I look forward to all his posts as they are informative and interesting with awesome photos to look at which make it very easy to live vicariously through him. Thanks 'bunk, heres to ya buddy."
15315,bpsbassman,2006-12-23 02:16:00,941,"Hey Bunk, I can only imagine the pressure on you the next time you go to make a post Keep up the great work Bud!"
15330,snag,2006-12-23 03:31:00,1932,"Hey y'all,  Thanks for enjoying my misfortune.  Yes, he still hasn't called!  I'm a bunk man myself.  Bunks reports have the power to transport and include you in the experience.  That is the talent of a true story teller."
15336,wishn4fishn,2006-12-23 03:39:00,108,I vote this best of the best thread of 2006.  Moosebunk owns.
15399,Moosebunk,2006-12-23 14:15:00,3970,Wellllllllllllll wellllllll wellllllllll  Thanks a bunch ya'll who vote they like the reports from the north.  Haven't been out for a fish since Nov.3rd but that'll all change soon and I'll try and get something up for your reading pleasure.
14467,Crazyhook,2006-12-20 13:34:00,1154,"thread title only! what thread was your favorite laugh, report or info"
14469,ccmtcanada,2006-12-20 13:37:00,7971,"Hands down....my favourite thread was SNAG's salmon post called ""SCOTTISH SALMON XXX""  Here's the link..... http://ontfish.proboards89.com/index.cgi?a...9674&page=1  I still laugh when I think of that post....esp since the thing never called him back...but thanks to the support of this board, he was able to move on....."
14471,lew,2006-12-20 13:43:00,12767,Any fish'n report by Moosebunk from the land I'll probably never visit
14472,Whopper,2006-12-20 13:47:00,2174,Dam Lew you beat me to it!  I'll second all of Moosebunk's reports.  Whopper

14483,Garyv,2006-12-20 14:06:00,547,"Best threads....the suit I purchased at The Mens Warehouse!  For post type threads has to be Moosebunks reports with pictures.  Having spent some time in his area in years gone by it brought back lots of very good memories, one's I wish I could relive in 2007 or 08 or 09!"
14485,setomonkey,2006-12-20 14:07:00,872,"I can barely remember the threads I've read this month, so going back to the year??  Moosebunk's reports are right up there. Great fishing in a part of Canada that I may never get a chance to see (although never say never).  The post-Lakair flurry is always a treat too, I've visited the folks there but have never stayed at Lakair at the same time, so I like hearing about how it went (e.g., Peter/Biteme's pike derby winner, caught on a Jumla, right in front of the docks with everyone watching).  Mike"
14488,Gerritt,2006-12-20 14:10:00,6129,I would have to say my favorite thread of the year has to be  BIGCHEV4x4 is Home  glad to see!!  Gerritt
14492,Motorhead,2006-12-20 14:19:00,163,I`m going to have to go with anything from Moosebunk too... Amazing posts...  Doug
14502,bpsbassman,2006-12-20 14:55:00,941,"There are so many great threads to choose from.  After all its what keeps us all here. But my vote goes to: Moosebunk.........OFC ""Poster of the Year"" Everytime he posts one of his awesome threads, my body automatically relaxes and I get ready to be taken on a journey to a land that I only dream of. Thanks Moosebunk. Other threads that I really enjoy are threads like this one.  Thanks Crazyhook. (ie ""show me your best fish, best outdoor shots, etc.) They usually contain pictures from past posts that let you enjoy them all over again."
14552,Tacklebuster,2006-12-20 16:55:00,303,"there were several great reports this year, but I always look forward with anticipation to Moosebunks reports.  I enjoy reading his reports and he always has great pics."
14591,Joey,2006-12-20 18:50:00,9122,"I'm going to have to agree with ccmtcanada, Scottish Salmon had me laughing for days.  I always await Moosebunk's reports too, and I especially enjoyed the reports from DanC and Spiel this summer from Spiel and TEP's trip up there.  Joey"
14592,Rich,2006-12-20 18:53:00,3927,"Snag's reports are tops! Though I have to admit seeing Crazyhook and Lew doing the patented ""Lew Smile"" still makes me laugh to this day."
14605,Crazyhook,2006-12-20 19:45:00,1154,Two Lew smiles coming up! ( with matching hats to match)  
14640,mikeh,2006-12-20 22:02:00,824,I think Graftongal's post on catching those big sturgeon was one of the best.
14642,trapshooter,2006-12-20 22:05:00,1234,"Yeah, Sandy and Adam's Sturgeon trip was an awesome report.  Moosebunks are always top notch, for sure."
14646,Pete Maina,2006-12-20 22:11:00,213,Thumbs up for Moosebunk!  Great pic Crazyhook ... now I need an explanation on this one.
14652,fishergirl72,2006-12-20 22:53:00,455,The greatest one I have seen is the I need Help from The Canadians.LOL   Sorry Pete. I had to pick that one.
14691,Handlebarz,2006-12-21 00:33:00,3790,I would say all the posts that lead to the melt down for Crazyhook and found him the sponser it was great to watch unfold.
14692,FishFinder,2006-12-21 00:34:00,481,What happened to the Old OFC?
14696,Crazyhook,2006-12-21 00:38:00,1154,"Here is to you Eh! still have a "" jelly"" with your name on it! hopefully we can hook up in 07 ( I will bring breakfast)! "
14699,Roy,2006-12-21 00:41:00,13728," We're the same family, Fishfinder, we just moved into a nicer house in a better neighbourhood."
14700,Crazyhook,2006-12-21 00:41:00,1154,  Amen to that! took a while to figure out all the fancy buttons but its awesome
