14525,Nemo,2006-12-20 15:47:00,727,It all has to do with the temperature. Buy yourself a good thermometer. Stick it in the centre of the roast. Watch the temperature rise until it hits 140-145 degrees (Rare-MediumRare). Remove from oven and place on warm platter. Tent with foil and let stand aprrox 10 -15 minutes. This will allow the juices to move back into the meat.  Serve the skittish guys from the outside cuts and the carnivores near the centre.  Good Luck and Happy Cooking
14528,cooky2375,2006-12-20 15:52:00,1,Get yourself a thermometer and cook the beef from room temerature. For medium it should be around 140-150 degrees coming out of the oven. Temp it from the side of the roast. Dont go by time because there are lots of factors that can effect the timing. Are the bones still on the roast? and is it netted with the fat cap wrapped around the top. Be slow dont pound it with heat you'll just burn the outside and leave the inside red. Good luck with dinner !!!  what that guy said !!!!lol
14531,Headhunter,2006-12-20 15:55:00,5703,"OK, here's what I would do with that big beautiful Primer! Pre-heat the oven to 450 degrees. I would spice the outside of the roast with Montreal Steak spice and if possible, let it sit in that over night. Place the spiced roast in the pre-heated oven for one hour. Remove it from the oven and let it sit on the counter for two hours... cooling off time Then, place it in a 325 degree oven, insert a meat thermometer and cook it until it reaches 150 degrees in the thickest part of the roast. Once there, remove the roast from the pan, wrap it in aluminum foil and let it sit for atlesat 1/2 an hour before you begin carving. PM me your number and location and I'll be sure to help you enjoy the best part a cow has to offer! Use the drippings off the roast for gravy/au-jue (SP) HH"
14534,yellowboat,2006-12-20 15:56:00,211,Recipe from expensive restaurant.  Rub roast with Italian sesoning Crust with kosher salt Bake at 500 F for 30 min lower temp too 300F for 6-8 hrs (1/2 hrs per pound or so)til internal temp 140-145 let rest for 30 min
14535,caper,2006-12-20 15:59:00,210,MMMM what time is dinner!!
14537,Cookslav,2006-12-20 16:01:00,1457,"What  kind of oven are you useing? Conventional or Convectional? And are you cooking with the bone and cap on? And do you know the cap width by chance?  Generaly a bone on quarter inch netted cap will cook to Medium rare in 2-2.5hours a convectional oven especialy a smaller sizer roast.  But bare in mind If your cooking with out the bone or cap on you will decreas cooking time significantly...probobly by a half hour or more. And a conventional oven will tend to take longer being there is no air flow...  I would recomend 30 minutes at 400 degrees, then drop your oven temperature to 325 and continue for and additional hour and a half then get your meat thermometer...  Check the internal temp(through the cap to the bone) after the hour and a half has gone by.... your shooting for 130 degrees (medium rare) so if after an hour your there or with in 5 degree's... Pull it out and let it rest for a good 15 minutes or so.(don't cut into it when she's fresh out of the oven...you'll loose all your juice and dry it out fast)  I recomend a ton of Montreal Steak spice rubbed under the cap,  then scor the outside of the cap in big X's(helps the fat break down and flavor the meat) Cook in the Pan rib side down, and put a little water/beer or redwine mix(half and half) in the bottom of the pan....about 2-3cups to keep the Humidity in the oven high, and increase the arroma (this will keep your yeild high)  Plus if your making some Jus after....its a great flavor boost. Some Carrots, and onions in the pan never hurt either.  Just be sure to check that internal temp if your ever in question.... Prime rib is reeeeely well marbled and can be quite variable in Fat content, therefore the fat can render off quicker then expected sometimes and act as a catilist....hence cooking your meat much faster then expected.  But a 2 hour cook time for a small roast should be good....I can't see it taking more then 2.5-3max  Good luck,  Oh and don't forget to stay hydrated...I recomend a beer for the Chef every half to one hour"
14543,John,2006-12-20 16:12:00,2956,Headhunters recipe is perfect except I would go for 145 degrees and serve the wusses the outside and the real prime rib appreciators the middle!
14544,Cookslav,2006-12-20 16:13:00,1457,  Thats the best idea...don't ruin the meat for a few old school boys 130-135 is industry/restaurant standard for Med Rare But don't forget the meat does not stop cooking just cause you took it out of the oven.... I'd say 140 is solid meduim but if you pull it from the oven at 140 and rest the meat for 15-30miuntes you run the risk of hitting 145-150 and getting med well.  The meat will continue to rise for a good 15 minutes to a half hour before it planes out... depends on the thickness/leaness of the cut.
14546,ccmtcanada,2006-12-20 16:24:00,7971,Awww man....NOW I'M HUNGRY!!!! LOL.  Gotta have an early lunch now...
14548,BITEME,2006-12-20 16:32:00,1969,You are all outstanding Thanks for the tips wish me luck  Peter
14576,1leggedangler,2006-12-20 18:09:00,364,"Hey Peter hope the dinner turns out well and wish there were more employers like you who appreciated the hard work put in by staff especially this time of year.  Cheers, 1leg"
14580,lew,2006-12-20 18:19:00,12767,"dang, I'm sitting here eating a cheese sandwich while I read this  Enjoy your roast Peter, it sounds great !!"
14581,Headhunter,2006-12-20 18:29:00,5703,"One more thing while I still remember... never and I do mean never use a fork or anything like a fork to pick up the cooked roast. You don't want to pierce the outside of the roast... only use tongs! also, never remove the meat thermometer from the roast until you cutting it... you'll just watch all those beautiful juices pour onto your cutting board... and if that does happen... pour them into the au ju! HH"
14609,Gerritt,2006-12-20 19:58:00,6129,BiteMe..   what the rest have said... but do one more thing... KEEP the rib bones!!!! They are fantastic on the BBQ the next day!!!   Nothing beats Montanas Beef ribs..... MMMMMM I can taste em now!!!   Gerritt
