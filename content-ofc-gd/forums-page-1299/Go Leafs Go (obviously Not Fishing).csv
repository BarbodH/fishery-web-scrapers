14555,Tacklebuster,2006-12-20 17:00:00,303,"Go Leafs GO AWAY!, The only way the leafs will ever get better is to finish in the basement.  Only when the fans stop paying rediculous prices to see a losing team, stop paying for leafs tv, and stop buying their merchandice, will the team get better.  The Leafs are nothing but a cash cow for a bunch of investors, who could care less if the team wins or loses, becauses the fans will keep paying and buying regardless.   All they need are a couple of token players to keep the fans interested.  Go Habs Go to the cup."
14564,holdfast,2006-12-20 17:18:00,1813,"Koivu, Sunbeam, Alfredsson, Nasland,  Whos Kidding?  Choke Choke Choke,  Run away, Run away, Runaway.  Dont look at these Captains to lead in any playoffs  Deer leading Lions   It will not work! in the end"

14689,camillj,2006-12-21 00:30:00,1988, Well Danny boy .. Like I said some of us are Leafs fans win or lose ... it was definitely a BRUTAL game to watch last night...  but ... as with most fisherman I tend to focus on the next bite (hit/win) and how great it feels ... not on the hours or days trying to make it happen   In fact I'll bet theres a lota guys at bars in cities around the globe doing the same thing waiting for ther next chance at wimmins . and they keep coming back evry night ... just cause it MIGHT HAPPEN

13055,wishn4fishn,2006-12-17 01:44:00,108,"Tucker went off early took Shanahan's slapshot in the wrist.  FYI my high skool science teacher was Shanahan's cousin.  Great game, wicked momentum.  They're leaving the goalie in lol, to teach him a lesson.  How embarassing..."

13491,Mike the Pike,2006-12-18 04:00:00,3421,"Here is some entertainment for you Leaf fans.  There are four NHL players: a Flyer - Roenick, a Hab - Theodore, a Sen - Alfreddson, and a Leaf - Belfour. GOD says: if u wanna die, tell me how u wanna die. Flyer : I wanna drown to death so GOD puts the flyer in a tank full of eels and seals the top for no escape ...NEXT. Hab : I wanna die in bed so GOD throws him in a bed of roses and lets the prick(hab fan) get pricked and die ...NEXT. Sen: i wanna choke to death so GOD gives alfy a LONG awaited haircut and throws him in a game vs. the leafs...CH-CH-CH-CHOKE! ...NEXT. Leaf: *looks in the mirror*...are u kidding me?     Q. Tie Domi and Mats Sundin went off a cliff in the bus. Why was everyone mad?   A. The Bus could have seated the entire Team     Q. What is the difference between the Toronto Maple Leafs and a cigarette machine? A. You can get Players out of a cigarette machine   Q. What do the Toronto Maple Leafs, Toronto Argonauts and the Toronto Blue Jays all have in common besides being based in Toronto? A. None of them can play hockey     Saturday Night, a man decides to go watch the Leafs play the Habs at the ACC....  He has pretty bad tickets, and notices an empty seat way down really close to the Ice Surface....  Halfway through the game, the seat is still vacant, so he wanders down to it..... he asks the man sitting next to the empty seat if its taken.... the man replies ""Yes, im saving it for my wife....she was supposed to come but she died a few days ago....""  The man knods in acknowledgment, but before he goes he asks ""How come you didnt just give the extra ticket to a friend or family member?""  The man replies: ""Theyâ€™re all at the funeral""   A drunk decides to go ice fishing, so he gathers his gear and goes walking around until he finds a big patch of ice. He heads into the center of the ice and begins to saw a hole. All of sudden, a loud booming voice comes out of the sky. ""You will find no fish under that ice.""  The drunk looks around, but sees no one. He starts sawing again. Once more, the voice speaks, ""As I said before, there are no fish under the ice.""  The drunk looks all around, high and low, but can't see a single soul. He picks up the saw and tries one more time to finish.  Before he can even start cutting, the huge voice interrupts. ""I have warned you three times now. There are no fish!""  The drunk is now flustered and somewhat scared, so he asks the voice, ""How do you know there are no fish? Are you God trying to warn me?""  ""No"", the voice replied. ""I am the manager of this hockey rink.""  Four hockey fans were climbing a mountain one day. Each was a fan of a different team, and each proclaimed to be the most loyal of all fans of their hockey team. As they climbed higher, they argued as to which one of them was the most loyal of all.  They continued to argue all the way up the mountain, and finally as they reached the top, the Canadiens fan hurled himself off the mountain, shouting, ""This is for the Great Montreal Canadiens!"" as he fell to his doom. Not wanting to be out done, the Edmonton Oilers fan threw himself off the mountain shouting ""This is for the Oilers!""  Seeing this, the Ottawa Senators fan walked over and shouted, ""This is for everyone!"" and pushed the Toronto Maple Leafs fan off the side of the mountain.     "
13501,lookinforwalleye,2006-12-18 04:13:00,4399,  Your right about that but i do see the habs ahead of the leafs in the standings.  9-2 or 6-3 = 2 points
