Now I can remember years when we didn't have snow by now, but I don't remember any being this warm.  How many of you are thinking of pulling your boats out of storage?  Oh well, at least it's safe for travel, speaking of which, it's time for me to travel down the road to work.  Have a great day all, and if you have some last minute shopping to finish, or for some of you, begin    , don't forget to take you patience with you.  Maureen"
15051,Whopper,2006-12-22 12:41:00,2174,"Yes Maureen, it's a little strange this year. I've been out    twice this week only wearing a sweatshirt and came to work today not even wearing a jacket  . Everyone be safe out there!    Whopper"
15062,ccmtcanada,2006-12-22 13:33:00,7971,"I dont have a boat...but if I did, I'd probably be thinking of taking it out of ""winter"" storage.  In the mean time, I'm having fun still heading out to do some shore fishing.  The first week of January is shaping up to be a good week.  I'll keep crossing my fingers!"
15080,setomonkey,2006-12-22 14:13:00,872,"It's raining right now in downtown Toronto, not the weather I'm used to at this time of year!  Hmmm, chance of a white Christmas is looking mighty low...  Mike"
15122,Rich,2006-12-22 16:06:00,3927,"Hey they are calling for wet flurries here on Christmas day, not exactly a white Christmas but as close as we're gonna get I think."
15223,fishdawg,2006-12-22 21:09:00,912,"this weather is Bullspit - sorry but I am winter guy  (skiing, hockey, icefishing....) - about to pull the plug on a booked ice bungalow trip for early Jan  however I am glad ive got good year round open water opportunities nearby & my boat is not ""winterized"""
15285,Rizzo,2006-12-23 00:52:00,4754,We got a lot of rain today in barrie.  Any other year I'd be outside shoveling right now...instead I'm having a rye/coke and checking out OFC!  Bring on the rain.
