I think the Leafs were giving a little too much good will to there fellow players as there wasn't a hit till the 3rd period.  But on to the cool stuff. While taking the elevator up to the 4th floor this older gent gets on and stands next to me, I am thinking ""Gee that guy looks just like Johnny Bauer""  The elavator attendant then says... how you doing Mr Bauer. So I got to meet him on the way up.  On the way down. I am standing and waiting for the elevator and I look beside me and Daryll Sittler is standing next to me! Said hello and got my father an autograph!  2 Hall of Famers in 2 elevator rides!!  Must have been my lucky day!"
