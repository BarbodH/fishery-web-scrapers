He is saddened to learn about the suicide bombers in Iraq that take countless lives and loved ones away from families and especially this time of year.  We did explain to him that the soldiers do want to perform their duties on behalf of their country and their beliefs etc., and we can only hope that our soldiers will return home safe with their families.  Our family would like to send Christmas wishes to all of the men and women that will not be home for Christmas as a result of being posted overseas to keep our country safe. Our family will pray for their safe return home and that the guns will be silenced for Christmas Day.  Some families will not be celebrating Christmas due to the loss of loved ones that fought for our country and we hope that those families will remember the great times and memories created with their loved ones before they left to serve in our forces. Peace be with you and your families.  Merry Christmas to all of our troops and their families.  Best regards, Sam, Laurie, Andrew and Hunter."

God bless you all and all those who are standing up for those who will someday (hopefully) enjoy the freedoms we are so fortunate to have here at home.

15703,Rich Clemens,2006-12-24 13:20:00,3131,Ditto .... many times over and again to our troops and their families.  I say 'our' ...... collectively for all the troops on both sides of our borders.  God Bless Them All and keep them safe !

He explained how much the people in the hostile areas appreciated our effort to help keep them safe as well as all notes of good will. I can't tell you how much we appreciate this at work. Heres hoping all our soldiers come back safe from their tours, and that someday we won't need to send any one else into these enviroments."
15754,bpsbassman,2006-12-24 16:39:00,941,Hats off to your son Sam and a prayer for all those dedicated young men and women who so bravely defend our freedom.
