15255,Lungelarry,2006-12-22 22:27:00,294,"they don,t stick to fish very well,but if they're heavy enough ,you could knock out a fish if you get him just right.........."
15258,FinS,2006-12-22 22:33:00,463,"your funny, i meant how good would they be to pick up stuff from the bottom like metals and other magnetic pieces"
15260,ccmtcanada,2006-12-22 22:42:00,7971, LOL lungelarry...that was hilarious....I was actually imagining a magnet hitting a fish on the noggin.....haha
15262,fishnsled,2006-12-22 22:49:00,3520,I picked up a magnet rated for 200lbs at Princess Auto.  It's pulled up a few things with the biggest item being a gaff.  Lungelarry - You're too funny!!!
15265,Terry,2006-12-22 23:02:00,14456,I guess they would get steelhead
15278,Mike the Pike,2006-12-23 00:01:00,3421,Yup they work well. on two ice fishing trips with my buddies we retrieved a Rapala filet knife and a pair of pliers of course it was easy for us we could see the botton from the inside of the shack the items  were 20ft down and the horseshoe magnet was about 5 inches be 4 inches.We also caught about 20 steelheads

15573,Chris Cross,2006-12-24 00:18:00,46,"I have dropped a fair amount of tools over board. The magnet has saved the tool many times. Snap-on doesn't have a fishing magnet, but if they did I'd own one. I use a big flat magnet. Looks like a brake rotor. I,ve pulled up allot of things with it. At the marina, I used it to get ancors, knife, bbq tools, that kind of stuff. CX"
