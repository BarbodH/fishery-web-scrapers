15364,skiel,2006-12-23 12:43:00,30,Dan thanks for posting the link to Al's slide show. You guys really have a beautiful area up there.  Al- You really did an excellent job of documenting your fishing and the photography is excellent. Thanks for joining and enjoy your stay!
15568,Pinch,2006-12-23 23:52:00,231,Great pictures there.  What kind camera did you use?
15640,Guidofisherman,2006-12-24 03:44:00,206,"The camera is a Canon S400 but I bought the underwater case for it. All the buttons and camera features work underwater to a depth of 130 ft. If I'm down that deep, I'm not coming back. The camera and case float so no worries dropping it overboard. I can use it in the rain, snow or sand without worry. Just rinse the case under water. I have used it diving on reefs in the ocean and it is great. I think I have attached a photo of me in Cuba feeding the fish. My next camera will have more megapixles but a waterproof case is a must for me. Alan"
15643,Spiel,2006-12-24 03:51:00,9065,.....Welcome aboard Alan. Being a life long Brookie man I can sure appreciate the beauty of those photos. Also having been up that way fishing last September with Dan it just fuels my desire to get back as soon as possible.    Perhaps I'll be fortunate enough to meet you on my next trip.
15649,Guidofisherman,2006-12-24 04:18:00,206,"Thanks Spiel: About a week or so before you came up here, Dan mentioned around the camp fire and a few pops he had someone traveling north to fish. Maybe someday we'll hit the same fish'n hole for those famed brookies."
15653,Spiel,2006-12-24 04:38:00,9065,"....Well I can tell you this Alan, as a life long fly fisherman I won't travel up that way again without my fly rod. The days I spent there I definitely wish I had brought one along and your pictures certainly show me I should have. Hopefully we can toss some big Brookie flies together some day.  Cheers and Merry Christmas."
15690,Rattletrap2,2006-12-24 06:25:00,1652,"Thanks Dan, for posting the link. Welcome Al! Very enjoyable slideshow indeed!"
14986,danc,2006-12-22 02:48:00,4677,"A local Brook Trout fishing friend of mine, Al Muir,  has put together this slide show featuring our local Brook Trout fishing. The photography is incredible, as is the entire show. So, if you like Brook Trout in their prime colors, fantastic scenery and photography, sit back and enjoy.  http://photoshare.shaw.ca/gallery/amuir/"

14999,Guidofisherman,2006-12-22 03:23:00,206,"Merry Christmas to the OFC Community. I'm Al (Guidofisherman) and thanks to Dan, a local fishing friend, I have joined when Dan asked to post my slideshow about the Brook Trout. I'm not sure if it is a passion or a sickness, but I love fishing for them. Alan"
15000,Nemo,2006-12-22 03:25:00,727,Great Photos of some nice fish.  Any idea where he got the hat with H2SO4 on it. Kind of cool if it means what I think it means.  Thanks for sharing...
15002,danc,2006-12-22 03:30:00,4677,"  Well thanks for the permission to post the slide show Al, and welcome aboard. There's a few Thunder Bay guys on here. One more won't hurt. In fact, with you on board now, that's pretty much all, of us.  Seriously Al, OFC is a great place to belong to if you're into fishing. You'll like it here. Don't be a stranger. I'll be in touch soon."
15003,Ron,2006-12-22 03:32:00,1683,"Welcome to the board Al. I am sure you will enjoy it here. I have admired your web site, alot of useful information on there in relation to Brookie habitat and so forth.  Have you had much oportunity to fish in Superior for the Coasters?  And you are right, it is a sickness, the only cure is to fish more often."

15162,Guidofisherman,2006-12-22 17:14:00,206,"I've been a member for less than a day and have enjoyed wandering around the forum and rest of the site. Impressive! To Nemo, yes the chemical signature on my fishing hat is: ""H2SO4"" which stands for Sulphuric Acid. I got the hat from a friend of mine who works at a local mill that uses it. I'm happy other fishermen appreciate the Brook Trout Slideshow. Al (Guidofisherman)"
