14982,dheitzner,2006-12-22 02:34:00,314,"i am torn. i think that on boxing day i may buy either a vexilar FL-8 or a Lowrance x67c ice machine. i realise some of the pros and cons of these 2 units but i was hoping that OFNers could share their views on them. anyone out there own either of these machines? likes/dislikes? pros/cons? thanks alot, darcy"
14990,fishdawg,2006-12-22 02:59:00,912,"I own both models Darcy & am very happy with both  x67c - is more versatile- has both graph & flasher options, they also make a GPS option model too - the flasher also has the bottom zoom feature  which the fl-8 dosent - also can be used on the boat - i use mine on my bow mount - slight downside is that it can slow a little in extreme cold  fl-8 easy/simple to use & wont ""slow down"" on you  whatever your choice, they are both fine units"
15007,Ron,2006-12-22 03:40:00,1683,"Neither,  I'll stick to my X 135 now, will never look back. I had a Vex FL-18. Sold it after trying this setup. No need for ""Vex eyes"" for me. It's got an alarm if I tend to wander off. The side bar has real time plus if I turn away for a monment, I still have about a 20 second history screen to show. I can zoom in to a specific depth, split screen and most importantly, EASY TO DECIFER!        "
15394,dheitzner,2006-12-23 14:06:00,314,that is a pretty cool setup ron!  very innovative. thanks for the input guys darcy
15402,Smokey,2006-12-23 14:23:00,1278,I can't comment on the vex but I do own the x67c and love it. Works well in both modes and the flasher is great on the hard water. I use it year round by converting it and attaching it to my bowmount.  So you know my chouce would be the Lowrance.
15404,Terry,2006-12-23 14:32:00,14456,well I just bought a x67c ice machine I have not used it yet on sale at lebarons...372.00 or something like that
15429,Dondorfish,2006-12-23 15:52:00,1000,Well - I am in the same boat as Terry. I purchased one a couple of months ago and can't wait to get out on the ice and try it out!  Looks pretty good    Don
15468,duber,2006-12-23 18:37:00,220,"For me the lcd unit can't compare for ice fishing.I have a vex fl8-se and a lowrance with the flasher option.I find the slight delay in the lcd unit annoying.Also my vex will run in -20C temps trouble free for 4 full days of fishing on just its little battery , the lowrance runs for half that on the same battery.One thing the lowrance has over the vex is it is quieter but my Lowrance stays in the garage when the water is hard.  Either is a lot better than fishing blind!"
