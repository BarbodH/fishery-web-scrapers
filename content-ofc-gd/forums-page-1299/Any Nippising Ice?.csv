15208,Terry,2006-12-22 20:32:00,14456,I just know everyone is starting these threads to piss me off I have a Jan 5 booking on nip and it's looking bad and every day there is a new thread about it remind me there is no ice
15209,Ron,2006-12-22 20:37:00,1683,"Hey Terry,  They will get their just cause. Especially when I put a post up in February about what their new boats would be like on the water right about now......"
15212,irishfield,2006-12-22 20:46:00,26272,"What do you mean ""would"" Ron. I may be able to launch it and use it for our outing..... LOL"
15266,lookinforwalleye,2006-12-22 23:09:00,4399,I think the only ice you`re going to see any time soon is in your rum and coke.  Merry Christmas!
15276,Mike the Pike,2006-12-22 23:53:00,3421,Terry I think your going to have to trade the 4 wheeler in for a boat .Were not trying to piss you off we are all being honest its reality .Could always drive to James Bay they may have ice there or maybe not.Denver sounds pretty wintery.
