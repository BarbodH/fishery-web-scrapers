15008,joonmoon,2006-12-22 03:41:00,528,Jan 1/07...but by the looks of the weather good luck on having good enuff ice.......wish for the big freeze.
15026,lunkerbasshunter,2006-12-22 05:01:00,2585,more like jan 1 2008 the way the weather is looking!
15038,newlundowner,2006-12-22 08:47:00,4,Thanks for the info!  What if there is still open water?  Is that legal to fish from a boat?
15064,ccmtcanada,2006-12-22 13:38:00,7971,"The fishing regs specifically say ""ice fishing"" for Scugog...no other lake does it specify that....so I'm not too sure.  It says.... | Fishing is prohibited in all waters of Div. 6, including Kawartha Lakes and Dalrymple Lake in the City of Kawartha Lakes (formerly known as Victoria County) and Simcoe County, from Nov. 16 to the Friday before the last Saturday in April in any year.  This restriction does not apply to Lake Scugog ice fishing in Jan. and Feb  Maybe someone from that area can clear this up!"
15113,spooner_jr,2006-12-22 15:56:00,193,"The regulations say: ""Lake Scugog:  walleye and yellow perch seasons open Jan.1 to last day in Feb"".  I'll be out in the boat if there's no ice."
15124,ccmtcanada,2006-12-22 16:09:00,7971,Gotta love clear regulations.....LOL
15152,fishindevil,2006-12-22 16:46:00,6254,"yes you can fish in a boat but,the ice fishing regs do not cover fishing in a boat then its back to the normal regs you can only use 1 rod as opposed to 2 for ice fishing,   so there will probably be guys in boats as itsa not lookin real good for ice is it????  well there is still guys fishing the bay in boats and they say till the ice comes they wilkl stay out,no im wishing i never put my boat away   cheers"
15188,joonmoon,2006-12-22 18:48:00,528,"The MNR should step in and close Scugog for the winter as well, with or without ice just to give the fish a break. Sorry about the hut operators out there but the future of the fishery could depend on it. I myself luv ice fishin but I think Scugog should be closed like the rest of the Kawarthas or maybe some sort of rotating yearly schedule...hey that might be cool fish a different Kawartha lake every year...hmmm."
