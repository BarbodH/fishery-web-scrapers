15233,dsn,2006-12-22 21:29:00,1018,I'm just wondering if anyone will be fishing on Christmas Day besides me. Weather permitting that is. 
15235,camillj,2006-12-22 21:32:00,1988,Last time I pulled that off was when I got a brand new pair of Neoprene  Waders from my wife. She was thrilled .. I took my (then 5 year old daughter) down to Bronte and came back with a pretty 5lb silver coho ... isnt that why they extended the season to Dec 31st  Actually I think it was Boxing day ... the regs protect all fish on Christmas day
15237,ccmtcanada,2006-12-22 21:35:00,7971,Blyght and I were thinking about it...and if the weather is right and the kids are entertained...who knows?? haha.
15239,Greencoachdog,2006-12-22 21:39:00,8163,"Well if somebody could stop by and pick me up on the way, I'd really appreciate it!"
15243,dsn,2006-12-22 21:51:00,1018,"Glad to hear I'm not the olny one.  Well Greencoachdog, I would but I have no ride so I'll be going to the local hangout I guess for pike?   Or whatever else comes along. I might even do boxing day since I'm not one for crowds."
15245,setomonkey,2006-12-22 22:01:00,872,"You guys are bold, or maybe I'm too timid...  I'll be too full anyway if my eating plans work out.    Mike"
15264,GbayGiant,2006-12-22 23:01:00,1780,"Ice or not I'll fish off the docks at my sisters for christmass, and watch NFL all day sunday."
15268,Canuck2fan,2006-12-22 23:14:00,1444,I hope to be fishing if it stops raining and the tribs aren't too muddy...
15274,Mike the Pike,2006-12-22 23:44:00,3421,I am going to try sunday for some rainbows and browns.No fishin xmas day but Christmas eve I 'll take it.The waiders are coming out of storage LOL.I am not going to sleep until sunday night.Mike
15282,Rizzo,2006-12-23 00:24:00,4754,hahaha you've got to be kidding.  I'd have my butt kicked so far into 2007.  Wouldn't even contemplate it.
15288,ccmtcanada,2006-12-23 01:06:00,7971, That's the great thing about my wife...she wants to head out to fish as much...if not more than I do....I'm a lucky guy!!!  Christmas Eve is looking like a good day though...Christmas day and Boxing Day it looks likes colder weather...with snow....
15363,Eddyk,2006-12-23 12:25:00,195,Fishing Christmas Day? You must be kidding.
15374,Rich Clemens,2006-12-23 13:38:00,3131,Rizzo ..... if you see someone flying pass you on your way into 2007 ... that would probably be me.
15487,Carp,2006-12-23 19:24:00,1488,"Christmas Day would be taboo 'round here, but boxing day is always a possibility."
15488,urbanangler1990,2006-12-23 19:27:00,933,"yup for sure! we are gonna have our dinner on christmas eve, sooo yeah ill be out at my fav trib! hey DSN where are u planing to get out?"
