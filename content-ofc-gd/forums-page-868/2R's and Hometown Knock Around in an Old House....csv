328040,Garry2Rs,2009-04-09 00:57:00,1425,"At the end of February my daughter bought an older house and like a good Daddy I hurried home from Sunny Arizona to Freezing Hammertown to help with the renovations.  I'm not the handiest guy around, but I can paint.  I know how to install simple things like toilets and dishwashers and I can make lights and ceiling fans work.  On this job I picked up a little dry-wall experience and resprayed a textured ceiling... This project involved a lot more than that, so at this point I would like to say a very big and public Thank You to my friend Albert, aka The Hometown Handyman.  He stepped in to help with the installation of new laminate floors and he installed the new kitchen cupboards.  He also managed to work some ""Had-to-be-seen-to-be-believed"" magic with the trim. Albert...Thanks again buddy...without you I might still be there!  So here are the Before and After shots... Living room:       Dining Room:     Kitchen:         Bathroom:     Bedrooms: There aren't any before pictures of the bedrooms...they were just empty spaces. We painted, removed old carpet, installed laminate floors, trimmed and changed the light fixtures. Here's how they turned out...      There's a new fence and new doors but those jobs I had nothing to do with. Anyway thanks to the Hometown Handyman the jobs all got done before the fishing season started...grin."

328063,tinbanger,2009-04-09 01:32:00,1028,looks great .  Garry where in Arizona ?  TB
328069,Cookslav,2009-04-09 01:40:00,1457,"Good stuff! A good indoor project is always fun over the winter. I can appreciate the work involved, and I'm sure your Daughter is happy as can be.  Cheers,"
328079,HTHM,2009-04-09 01:52:00,4082,"Thanks for the kind words Garry  ....now for the true story: I arrived on site and Garry and his daughter are there slugging away, they have this fellow installing a new front and back entry system. Apparently it was a very difficult install as he was on the install 3 or was it 4 days. As well Garry forgot to mention that he installed all the light fixtures, all of the plumbing fixtures, and all the upstairs laminate. All I did was the lower floor, screwed up some cabinets on the walls, some case and base and a little bit of odds and ends. Garry is a good student! The admission has to be made that the whole week one of us was grumbling, ""Teach a man to cast, and he'll spend days putting laminate flooring down"" All in all it was fun, despite the company"
328083,holdfast,2009-04-09 02:01:00,1813,Good on you Albert.  Really looks good.  Luv how the Kitchen Turned out.
328087,rbaquial,2009-04-09 02:05:00,968,OMG!! It looks GORGEOUS!  Great job!!  Quick question: Why was there a MIRROR in your OLD KITCHEN?
328097,silveradosheriff,2009-04-09 02:27:00,1025,Awesome job!
328101,Joey,2009-04-09 02:38:00,9122,Fantastic job     Now I know who to call when I want to do some reno work  Joey
328106,Garry2Rs,2009-04-09 02:56:00,1425,"Thanks Folks I know she is happy with the results.  And what the heck, my hands will heal in time for the Crappie opener...grin.  Tinbanger: I spent the Winter in Yuma Arizona.  Yes, I wish I was there now!  Addikted2fishing: Strangely there is no window in the kitchen.  I think the mirror was to brighten up the sink area. We removed some cupboards so that it wasn't such a cave and added more lights that could be aimed.  Joey: You call Hometown Handyman I'm officially retired...hahaha.  Hometown Albert: A couple more rooms and you'll have those casting lessons worked off...(snicker - snicker)"
328114,HTHM,2009-04-09 03:17:00,4082,"That's it, I sendin' you an invoice!    Or maybe some bass boat time will seal the deal too."
