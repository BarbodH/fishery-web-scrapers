328373,l2p,2009-04-09 23:34:00,346,"so was out today in the afternoon and was dead for the most part, just before leaving i saw a nice section of water and opted for one more drift... half way down the run float goes down.. fish, after 5 min or so i have the fish near shore and snap goes my rod... sucks to happen just before opener. if anyone has a top half for either the raven 14' im8 3pc or the 13' frontier mx i will buy, let me know before opener!!!  the devil fish that snapped my rod..   also if anyone knows who to talkto/send the im8 to for repair or replacement a pm would suffice, thanks in advance!"
