Lots of structure out there, hard to find the fish thats for sure.  did better this winter than i do during softwater season.  Smaller fish like the weeds as the water warms up.  The bigger fish i hear are found suspended in deeper water, troll with riggers to find them but in may i would fish structure, try different depths, look for some moving water or bays adjacent to moving water.  watch the slot size, mnr is always around the area."
