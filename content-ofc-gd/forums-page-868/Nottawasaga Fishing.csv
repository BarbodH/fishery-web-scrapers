328250,4x4bassin,2009-04-09 16:56:00,1025,As per an earlier post I am heading up to the mouth of the Notty this weekend to try my luck flatlinning for some rainbows. Has anyone been out in the bay recently ? If so any tips !!! What are the conditions at the mouth ? Should we try some where else like Craigleith or Thournbury ? Thanks

328545,krawler,2009-04-10 16:13:00,167,"I fish the area on weekends when i can.  Have not been out this year, i fish on the east side of nottawasaga bay, west winds always push the ice on our shoreline.  shore angling has been slow, i think in a boat would be more productive."
328556,centerpin_drift,2009-04-10 17:24:00,94,"i dont think anyone fishing gbay wants to give up any reports, or the entire GTA will be crowding up our water, and judging from the turnout in tbury this morning, theres not much water left for the locals"
