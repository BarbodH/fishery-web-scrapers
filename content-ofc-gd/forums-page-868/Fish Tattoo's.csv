If we were gonna get tatoo'd we'd be up on a charge and RTM'd. Seems a few fellas got rather ill after getting some art work. That was enough of a turn off for me. Now Lew, you sound like some of the old barrack stanchions I've met. One old sweat had a tatoo from every major port he had visited"

189414,mepps,2008-04-19 02:18:00,1301,"I'd have to agree with you Daplumma - if it was 10 years ago.  Todays world is becoming more and more tattooed and pierced.  I've worked for very large professional companies and have seen a huge change in policies and acceptance of body modifacation.  I've got half inch holes through my ears and only once heard grieft from a potential employer.  Granted if I went to an interview with my face tattooed it may be a problem.  I bet you'd be surprised how many of your own clients are tattooed and pierced under their suits.  With all the tattoo shows on TV it wont be long until the modified out number the ""normal"""

189539,mepps,2008-04-19 16:19:00,1301,I actually had one boss recommend that I take otu my earrings when I worked at a big bank downtown TO.  I was a teller in a suit seeing hundreds of client each day - many of whom were CEOs and big bosses at the suroundinng buildings.  I told my manager that if she asked me to take out my earrings she'd have to ask every other employee under her too as well - including women.  She didnt bring it up again. When I left the job she told me I was one of her favorite people she had worked with and gave me great references ever since.  I work with a couple guys out here in Halifax with their forearms tattooed - no one even gives them a second look.  If anything its a conversation starter to be pierced and tattooed these days!

Besides ""us older ones"" have our own body modifications their called scars and each of them have a story behind them. The kids now adays have so many safety devices IE bike helmets, knee pads, wrist protectors, safe swing sets, bike trail......well you get the picture their parents have robbed them of the path to manhood by scars.

190156,mepps,2008-04-21 02:35:00,1301, I've seen some pretty bad aged tattoo - but todays inks and aftercare are quite a bit different then 20 years ago.  You'll be seeing tattoos keep their colour and detail far longer then they ever did before.  If cours eit all depends on skin types and how much sun exposer you get aswell but theres no reason a 50 year old tattoo cant look good these days!
190294,Rattletrap2,2008-04-21 14:15:00,1652,"Mepps, It ain't the tat we are concerned about, or how it will look at 50 years! It's the degradation of the ""canvas"" under the work of art that we are concerned with! LOL  Lew, No fair, you kept wearing them heavy rain coats and stuff overtop to hide every one of them! LOL"
190298,Headhunter,2008-04-21 14:40:00,5703,"I gotta admit that I'm with ""the plumma's"" on this one... but I guess to each their own! I do have to wonder though, much like many here, how they will look after time has taken there toll on the ""canvas"". TO be honest, as I get older, I'm find the orafice's that I can equipped with can cause me issues, having a complete stranger add a few thousand more... I don't need to go there! It is pretty rare for me to see one that doesn't make me cringe, but as I said above, to each their own... just make sure before you do it, your not gonna want to change your mind! I wonder how much longer this fad amoung the majority will revert back to the minority? HH"
190299,Mike01,2008-04-21 14:40:00,378,Anytime I am outside and my tattoo is showing it gets a bath of 50 spf.  It really helps keep the colour.

189324,Mike01,2008-04-18 23:09:00,378,Its more annoying than anything.  Is it going on your arm?
189326,DanTheMan,2008-04-18 23:11:00,257,Its going on my back/shoulder blade.
189327,mepps,2008-04-18 23:16:00,1301,"The back isnt too bad from what I hear, mine was done on my ribs, but only took a couple hours so it wasnt bad at all.  I have one planned on my stomach that I'll hopefully get in the next month or two."
189330,Mike01,2008-04-18 23:20:00,378,Its all in where the nerve endings are...if you pinch yourself you can get an idea of where it will hurt more.  I thought it was going to be a lot worse than it actually was.

I have several tattoos all have different meanings.. however none that are fishing related at the moment...  by far the most painful one was a custom dragon i have done on my chest (Back when I was fighting) and the dragons claw is VERY close to my nipple...  other then that i resemble it to a prolonged cat scratch when I describe the sensation.. and the longer it continues the number you get to it. I found outlining to be a tad more intense then the shading for sure.  G
189358,mepps,2008-04-19 00:22:00,1301,You mean this one HD??    Heres a couple beauties people have sent in to FF...     This one is my favorite trout tattoo ever...   And heres one of our logo on one of our writers! 
189361,addict,2008-04-19 00:24:00,475,nice tats so far would love to see more.everbody says the outline hurts the most but i found the shading a little rough especially near the armpit going over the same spot again and again.the outline is fast run the neddle over it once.
189368,Mike01,2008-04-19 00:38:00,378,going over the same spot SUCKS at first...but after a while you can't feel it anymore!!
189369,addict,2008-04-19 00:44:00,475, trust me if u got the marlin on the inside of your arm u would feel it the top outside of the arm is quite pleasaurable compared to the backside.
