327736,pirlo06,2009-04-08 01:24:00,17,"went to B.P and spent 5 bills on a sage fly reel and 4 on a sage fly rod, 100 bucks for the line another 100 on a fish pond chest pack, so 1100 right there not to mention that i bought my first boat at the end of summer, 18' 2002 fish hawk. spending money on fishing doesnt bother me because it is something that i truly love, its not about the money at all.             the money"
327768,Zubris21,2009-04-08 02:31:00,563,"I've been pretty good so far... Numerous $50 stops, but at one time the highest was about $250.  I'd imagine once I get a boat those numbers will increase drastically."

327786,rbaquial,2009-04-08 03:17:00,968,"I think the most I've ever spent on a single visit to BPS/LeBarons was in the neighborhood of $600... mostly on lures, after I sold my paintball gun!"
327788,Bassaholic,2009-04-08 03:20:00,74,I dropped $400 on 2 rods at LB 2 weeks ago. But they were having their no-tax sale so I also saved some $...at least thats what I was telling myself as I punched in my pin.
327789,RuNnYoOzE,2009-04-08 03:21:00,270,"back in '95 I bought 2 rods reels and equipment totally  close to a grand , back then it was the shimano quickclick2 reel and although I hadn't fished in years I went out this 1 weekend to a trib was carrying the rod to close to the ground and snapped the top part off.....really it casted better after that  but seriously I think Im going to invest in a st croix set up !"
327803,douG,2009-04-08 03:55:00,2693,"I bought gear for a while, most expensive single item was less than $225.  Then I decided I oughta get dressed, then bought a Nautilus 1000 floater one piece, and the BP 100 mph goretex suit.  The bps suit pushed the record upwards, but it was worth the cheek chewing.  If you're not warm and dry, it's not fun for me."

327834,Roy,2009-04-08 11:03:00,13728,I'd need to get a bigger paper route if I wanted to buy tackle. I don't spend a lot.
327967,tibbs,2009-04-08 21:18:00,650,The most I spent on one trip was around $400.
327974,River Rat,2009-04-08 21:42:00,161,"I spent over $4000 getting graphs, chips, networking cables, chargers, and trolling motor....then went and bought 2 optima DM31's for over $700.....then placed an order for over $2800 with Shimano in the same week. I was going to buy a 4 wheeler but I figured I would gear up the boat for bass season with the money I had and wait a year and see if the price dropped.....then the US exchange kicked in a 28% increase. At least my jeep can get almost anywhere the 4 wheeler would have.  RR  P.S. it's an expensive hobby if you do it right!"

327997,gdelongchamp,2009-04-08 23:21:00,199,"In 1978 I bought an ugly stick and a Mitchell reel for about a $100.00 while working in Uranium City. I used ttat same rod and reel for one year on Lake Atabasca where I caught a gazillion big ""big northerns"" and fifteen years on McKenzie Island of Red Lake in Nortwest Ontario including two years guiding at a fly in outpost where i caugth a gazillion pickerel. I broke my only rod in 1998 after I moved to Sudbury in 96. I have purchased and broken four rods since and reels in the last ten years. I used only jigs and spoons and for years made my own jigs. Needless to say I spend very little on gear and tackle.  Last year I bought a boat. motor and trailer package for $8000. I have spent $100 on tackle in the last year to outfit my four kids. Yeah I'm cheap and the kids are complaining they are not catching any fish so I guess it will be back to the tackle store this spring."
328032,FishHeadRic,2009-04-09 00:40:00,226,   But at least you get a 5 cent return for all the cans!   FHR
328036,fishnpro,2009-04-09 00:53:00,93,Most Iv ever spent is $1200 on a house of hardy fly rod and reel and it was worth every penny. I also picked up my brothers custom fly rod that day so the bill for 2 rods and 2 reels was well over $2000.
328082,snag,2009-04-09 01:57:00,1932,Somewhere between too much and not enough.  (leaning toward too much)
328139,KelfuN,2009-04-09 05:29:00,246,probably the kingpin and a rod..came out to $700
327591,ADB,2009-04-07 19:16:00,444,"I was working yesterday and I witnessed a customer spend over $1500 on two rods and two reels.  It got me thinking.  To me, that was a big purchase, although I'm sure to some of you it would not have seemed like such a big deal when you consider fish finders, or even boats.  My questions is, what's the most any of you have spent in one day on your fishing stuff at Bass Pro, Le Baron, etc.?  The most I've ever dropped in one purchase was probably around $350, although that has happened numerous, numerous times lol."
327597,tinbanger,2009-04-07 19:25:00,1028,Don't dare say in case it gets back to my wife. LOL.  seriously other than the boat ( her idea  ) most likely no more than $300 at one time . but lots of $20 - $50 purchases!  TB
327600,danbouck,2009-04-07 19:29:00,4380,Other that the boat. I would say about $500
327602,BassAsin,2009-04-07 19:34:00,806,"cant remember the most ever but one trip last year saw almost 1000$ go down on some soft plastics, out of the sale bins too top it off, 6 banana boxes full!"
327603,diggyj,2009-04-07 19:35:00,548,"About $800. 2 rods and  1 reel, some various tackle."
327606,fishnsled,2009-04-07 19:42:00,3520,"I'd say that there are usually one or two $200-$300 trips a year.  Depends on what I need and who has got me into some other type of fishing.  Headhunter got me into the planer board fishing for walleye a couple of years ago.  Dropped over a $1000 the following fall on planer boards, rods, linecounter reels, leadcore, baits, rod holders etc. etc etc.    Last year wasn't too bad when Cliff and Carole got me into carp fishing.      This year a new gps, 3 batteries, a trip to bass pro and i'm already over a $1000 and haven't even put gas in the boat. .  For a one time purchase it would be when I bought the boat.  That purchase, if not made, could have saved me thousands in future purchases.     Other then the boat it would be about $700 for a single trip.  Thanks for the reminder."
327608,DRIFTER_016,2009-04-07 19:52:00,10439,"Other than the boat, the most I have spent in one go was about $2000 of a fish finder/GPS combo. If I can ever save up the $$$$ it's replace ment will be in the $3000 range unless they come down a ton in the next year or so."

327622,Maverick,2009-04-07 20:15:00,371,I usually spend 5-600 bucks if I make the trip to BP or LB.

327635,tknohpy,2009-04-07 20:47:00,162,biggest one time purchase was around $800.  But there have been many purchases.  Since the New Year I have dropped about $3000 on gear and redoing the interior of my boat.
327636,OhioFisherman,2009-04-07 20:49:00,6623,"I used to make an early spring run up BPS, Cabela`s, in Michigan and Jann`s Netcraft in Toledo, usually dropped 250-300 a trip, but had me pretty much set for the year. A flea market a mile from the house so lots of deals, but a forty year collection.  Plus I collected and traded some older reels for a time. Looked around at the end of the season for clearance sales.  Other stuff like electric trolling motors I don`t count as gear."

I would put $5(a pack of smokes was about $5  back then) each day into a jar. One year later I had $1825. I went Angling Specialties in Scarborough and I bought, an offset AngSpec float reel, 13 ft IMX float rod blank, corks and reel seat and guides, Lamson fly reel,  10 ft Lamiglass fly rod blank, reel seat and a bunch of hooks and fly tying materials. George gave me a discount so that the total was exactly $1825.  I was very proud of myself for that. I would have smoked it all away. Haven't smoked since.  I've never spent that much at one time since.  muddler"
