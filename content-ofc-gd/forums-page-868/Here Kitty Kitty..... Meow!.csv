327225,rhare,2009-04-06 22:38:00,387,I spent the weekend down in Niagara hoping to get back into some good steelhead. Well the weather had other plans. Rain and wind made a mess of the river and it filled with ice Saturday.  We vegged in the hotel and planned on playing it safe and going cat'in the next day in the Grand river. My friend Paul from Cast Adventures had the day off guiding the Niagara with the crappy conditions so we twisted his rubber arm and took him out for the day of fishing where he just got to fish!. What a blast we had! Its been a couple years since I have fished for catfish but what a great time. We landed around 25-30 and lost many more. Eventually we ran out of cut bait. Dan was the cat whisperer for the day and landed most of the big ones.  Here's a few pics of the cats.  Cat man Dan   me with one of my only picture worthy fish   Paul with a good one!              Paul hamming it up 
327229,RuNnYoOzE,2009-04-06 22:41:00,270,sweet fish!  although this may sound stupid but all Ive ever used was night crawlers for cats!  what is cut-bait>? lol I told you it was a n00b question but is it just hunks of fish? sorry Atleast im honest !
327233,rhare,2009-04-06 22:47:00,387,  No worries thats what these boards are all about LEARNING  cut bait is strips or chunks of dead bait fish.
327253,wuchikubo,2009-04-06 23:16:00,1114,Nice cats!! I hope our outing with Steve in a couple of weeks will be productive too!
327266,Leecher,2009-04-06 23:41:00,7832,WOW!!!! those are some big kitties for sure    Paul's cat on the third pic is a hog..... BIG gut  It sure looks like you guys had a blast but looks a little chilly out there Great job you guys and thanks for sharing Leechman
327272,Whitespinnerbait,2009-04-06 23:52:00,2038,Dem Der cats qualify for Monster Status in my books....  :worthy:
327276,centerpin_drift,2009-04-06 23:59:00,94,"nice fish ryan, good to see the weather didnt completely ruin your plans."
327281,Cookslav,2009-04-07 00:11:00,1457,"Nice Cats, Those would tug your line pretty good for sure. man does that water look brown? blown out real good, but then again I suppose thats were the cats thrive. Cheers,"

327306,Fishing 24/7,2009-04-07 01:31:00,709,BEAST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!SSSSSSSSSSS
327404,siwash,2009-04-07 06:31:00,683,Interestig... It's odd that so few people in Ontario target cats... In the states there's a cult following   this looks to be a pretty good fishery... Are many people fishing for them?
327412,RuNnYoOzE,2009-04-07 08:47:00,270,  they are athletes in the water I admire Cats for their fight and the smaller 1's taste good beer battered and fried yummy
327457,rhare,2009-04-07 13:37:00,387,"    Nice meeting you Steve, and thanks for the meat! Man did you put a hurting on them out there!!!!  If your looking to have a good time catching cats give steve a call http://www.anglersway.net/"
327459,chukkk,2009-04-07 13:56:00,57,  I have received some great tips and read the board constantly and the advice is very much appreciated. That being said how do you rig up the line for the like hook placement and sinker placement. I would think they are right on the bottom. I plan on taking a charter with Steve a little later on to learn about them but would appreciate any tips in advance
327485,ben306,2009-04-07 14:53:00,59,Nice!
327551,chukkk,2009-04-07 17:27:00,57, Thanks very much for the info s'ville. It helps a lot do you have the leader come right off the sinker ?
327581,trapshooter,2009-04-07 18:56:00,1234,Niiiiice Ryan!  Awesome pictures.  You guys laid a hurting on those cats.   Well done.

328198,ccmtcanada,2009-04-09 13:52:00,7971,Fantastic outing for sure!  That's one species I've never targeted...and seeing all these reports makes me want to go out at least once to target them.  thanks for the report and pics!
