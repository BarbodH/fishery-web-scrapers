CRAA has commenced its daily fish lifts at the Streetsville ladder and will continue 7 days a week until completed.  The purpose is to transfer wild fish above the dam to suitable habitat and promote a wild self sustaining fish population.  It’s  a fantastic opportunity to come and give back to the resource. Fish lifts commence daily at 5pm and continue until completion so come early if possible, please bring waders, or if not possible wet weather clothing and boots. Parking is at the top of the entrance to the fish way at the bottom  DrenKelly,  and you may walk down the open gates but you can’t drive down  please be respectful of the local property owners when parking. FISH LIFTS ARE WEATHER DEPENDANT SO PLEASE CHECK THE CRAA WEBSITE MESSAGE BOARD FOR INFORMATION ON CANCELLATIONS www.craa.on.ca  You may also sign up for the CRAA steelhead derby while at the ladder and you must sign in at the lifts via a clip board provided.  We are looking at a record year so many hands make light work, students will be signed off for volunteer hours so please bring your sheets also.  A map is included for directions is included.
