328146,dizzidevil,2009-04-09 08:38:00,63,Hey guys thought you could help me out. Was wondering if the bows go into sixteen mile in Oakville all the way up to Milton? Also what fish is in that creek?
328152,RuNnYoOzE,2009-04-09 10:51:00,270,"SIXTEEN MILE CREEK  Excellent angling opportunities exist throughout the Sixteen Mile Creek watershed.  The West branch provides excellent coldwater habitat for brook, brown and rainbow trout, and chinook salmon are also found there during their spawning runs.  The Mill Pond, located within downtown Milton provides excellent angling opportunities for a number of panfish and carp.  Fishing derbies for stocked trout have occurred at the Mill Pond, but the pond does not provide suitable habitat to sustain trout populations. Both the middle and east branches provide opportunities for smallmouth bass fishing and the lower reaches provide additional opportunities to catch smallmouth bass and provide a migratory corridor for Lake Ontario fish.  Oakville Harbour provides angling opportunities for trout and salmon before they make their spawning runs and the rocky banks of the harbour provide excellent habitat for smallmouth bass."
