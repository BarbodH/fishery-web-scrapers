328070,sleded,2009-04-09 01:43:00,96,Well the wife for once said lets go out in the boat and do some crappie fishing i was like wow mark this day on the calender LOL   so we head out to a few spots with no luck and shes like lets go over to the tree over there with the dock so we head over and first cast i get a nice slab! After that it was non stop and we ended up keeping 20 crappies and letting go 10. They seemed liked they wanted it moving before they hit it and they were in tight to the wood. nice day to be on the water cant wait to do it again bring on the cats!
