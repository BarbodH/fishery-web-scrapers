Currently we're using a tar based adhesive with aluminium skin but it's not cost effective for the purpose in mind. I'm looking for a durable vinyl tape with super adhesion in a wide roll... preferably 6"". Product names and where to buy? Thanks in advance! -Brian"

327828,SlowPoke,2009-04-08 10:03:00,2984,"The purpose is to smooth out the interior walls of a trailer. Interior walls are plywood and scuffs/gouges/fist holes leave rough edges. We've had several trailers rejected for interior damage while loading full trailer width skids. The litmus test is wiping down interior walls with a piece of foam. If the foam catches, the trailer is rejected. I remember using a vinyl tape years ago, about 3mm x 12"", extremely durable and would probably stick to butter. That's what I'm looking for.  Gerritt, the tape we're using now is similar to dynamat but it's tar instead of butyl. Ohiofisherman got it right, it's intended for roof skins. Btw, brown bread is better and cheaper than dynamat!"
327855,OhioFisherman,2009-04-08 13:07:00,6623,"Pretty hard to load skids of bags in a trailer with damaged interior walls. one bump can tear the shrink wrap holding the bags on the skid(pallet) and tear the bags open. Other products can be damaged too, but nothing like torn bags of a product that is hazardous or messy like carbon black powder, that stuff will cover everything with a black dust and is hard to clean up.  Most of the trailers have a thin sheet of plywood or fiberglass about half way up the inside walls to cover the rivets and bolts used to build it and such. Some of the fiberglass trailers(Fiberglass over plywood) just have a short piece maybe 2 feet from the floor for the same reason.  Seen tape used on some for quick repairs, but never gave it much thought and never saw our mechanics doing it so never asked.  Brian here are a couple links for tape suppliers hope it helps.  http://directory.canadianmanufacturing.com...amp;cmoid=41914  http://www.sme.in/Strapping_Tape.htm  http://www.electrotape.com/"
327908,Gerritt,2009-04-08 17:22:00,6129,Hmmmm... just thinking outloud here.... but would Blueskin be a viable alternative? fairly inexpensive and sticks to just about anything! hell we use it on foundation walls.... It is a Bakor product..  http://www.bakor.com/residential_waterproofing.asp  G.
327912,irishfield,2009-04-08 17:29:00,26272,Beat the crap out of a few of the fork truck drivers and you're problems may slowly go away....
327914,SlowPoke,2009-04-08 17:36:00,2984,"No fiberglass allowed other wise we'd use FRP vans. No metel rub rails either It's like a moving target with this customer! Last night I delivered a rush load *hot hot hot*. They refused it, I was too early. I think another option might be body filler - they'll accept that. It's not quite as handy as whipping out a roll of tape on-the-spot but if maintenance could incorperate that into their PM schedule, we could update the fleet rather quickly. There's a lot of gravy in this contract so I can see why they're putting up with the fuss, just have to get through the growing pains. I might end up doing the pickup in Ohio (Bowling Green) myself rather than just the Windsor - Toronto delivery leg. Meet for coffee? LOL Thanks for the links. -Brian"
327915,SlowPoke,2009-04-08 17:45:00,2984, I don't see that being any cheaper than re-skinning with plywood once you factor in labour and downtime. They might have issues with the coating as well. Thanks for the thought though!    They'd enjoy that too much - twisted bunch.
327916,Gerritt,2009-04-08 17:49:00,6129,it is just peel and stick Brian!... one guy could line a 52' trailer in 2 hours? if not less!  In any event... good luck!  G
327951,tjsa,2009-04-08 20:32:00,1578,"Brian, one brand of vinyl tape we have used is called Polyken, manufactured by the below company, but it is expensive. $23.99 plus tax for a 100 ft. roll.  http://www.covcorp.com/catalog/products/adhesiv  We found another vinyl tape, seems just as good, but no name brand. It just says ""made in canada"" on the inside of the tube. We buy it at a local lumber supply place/hardware/tools store, 4"", 5"", and 6"". Maybe try checking in some of those places. They get it in as ""seconds"", meaning not full rolls of 100 ft. and have a couple bins full of the stuff. There is usually over 50' on a tube though. Price is 5-7 bucks depending on width. 4 or 5 color selections also. Works great on tile, doesn't leave a residue like duct tape if let for a period of time either, and wears abuse better. But, it does not work well on porous surfaces like brick or carpet. Haven't used it on plywood."
