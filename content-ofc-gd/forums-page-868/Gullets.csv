328650,gdelongchamp,2009-04-11 00:04:00,199,I was just wondering if anyone ever used gullets when fishing.
328651,rbaquial,2009-04-11 00:09:00,968,"What are ""Gullets""? 1st time I've heard this term being used?.... got any pictures?"
328661,gdelongchamp,2009-04-11 00:35:00,199,"When guiding years ago I use to cut the gullets out of  shore lunch walleyes and put them on jigs for the tourists. They are a tough piece of cartilage that I cut out, only takes a couple seconds,) and place it on a hook. It's v shaped and about 1""  long. They will stay on your jig almost all morning and the walleyes and northerns love them. I have never tried them on any other type of fish."
328727,TennesseeGuy,2009-04-11 02:42:00,957,I never let a gullet go to waste.  They make a difference.  A huge difference.  Stink helps.  I even add them to a bait such as a Suick.
