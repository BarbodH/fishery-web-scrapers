328248,tonyb,2009-04-09 16:40:00,1637,"Well said solopaddler, I have to agree with everything you said.  If the fee increase does nothing but maintain the status quo it is money well spent.  If it causes an increase in opportunities, that's just a bonus!  Sorry, I will not be signing the petition.  Would you sign a petition that called for a decrease in angling opportunities in NY but keeping the license fee the same?"
328249,Squid,2009-04-09 16:50:00,1656,"Well for those of us that actually pay the fee to fish on the american side of the border, the 40 dollar USD was equal to 53.0 dollars cad. Now that looks like it will go up to 70usd that equals 93.10 cad. When Amercans buy Ontario license and pay 60 buck CAD, that equal rougly 49 dollars usd. So monetary wise 94 cad is quite steep to fish US NYS waters. I can tell you that I will be reconsidering buying a new license in October 09 if this is the new fee for us.  For those that replied and do not have a NYS license, its easy to say go for it. For us that do enjoy fishing the us side, it sucks."
328269,Whopper,2009-04-09 18:16:00,2174," Pete last year it was backwards my $62 license actually cost me $68.20..... not that it really matters heck I'd pay $100 for a license to come fish with my Canadian friends  I really understand it's more about the rate of increase than the increase itself, the State of Ohio is doing stuff like this with fees that the citizens don't even have say in"
328282,craigdritchie,2009-04-09 18:47:00,1586,"Either way, a fishing license is still pretty cheap when you look at what you get for your money."
328296,Uncle Buck,2009-04-09 19:13:00,1000,"Is it still gonna be that piece of crap paper as a licence? i kept mine in my wallet, and the thing went blank... what the heck??? hopefully they make a hard plastic card... (blank paper/licence was replaced at no cost to me once i mailed them my old/blank one...)  as for the increase, it's quite a step up percentage wise... difference being the US do stock lots of fish, way more then Canadians, and they negotiate water access with land owners to help fisherman gain access to fishing grounds... too bad that doesn't happen here in Ontario, there's more & more NO FISHING signs coming up year after year...  for the 2 or 3X a year i fish NY, i'm still on the wall about wether or not i'm gonna renew... 1st year i got mine, i didn't use it once...  Phil, our dollar was higher for maybe 1 year, how many years have we been getting shafted with a lower dollar?"
328299,DRIFTER_016,2009-04-09 19:20:00,10439,"  Simple, it will hopefully cut down on the number of people on the rivers (those too cheap to pay the new fees). Less crowding on the rivers is always a big bounus to those of us who don't like to rub elbows while on the streams."
328359,kickingfrog,2009-04-09 22:51:00,8333,"Careful, elitism is very unflattering.  I am sure most of us would support more resources going toward improving our fishing and fish habitat.  Will this fee increase goes toward our interests.  If NY state needs more money to fund fish resources then all the people who use the resource should contribute. Not just people who can only vote with their feet.   Is it the price point that is not a concern? What if it was $700 or $7000 instead of $70? What if we are facing some of the restricted access that is prevalent in Europe in 10, 20 or 30 years? Then  we might be standing around looking at each other and wondering ""How did we get here??? Why didn't we do/say something earlier?""   Trying to see both sides here. Personally I haven't yet fished in NY state, and I may not irregardless of this fee increase, so for me a $70 license has no direct impact at this point."
328380,Rizzo,2009-04-09 23:48:00,4754," this is not actually a word, don't mean  to pick on you, but the misuse of ""regardless"" is just one of my pet peeves.

In BC licenses cost $55 for a Canadian from out of province + $60 steelhead stamp + $30 Salmon stamp. You want to fish sturgeon too? Add another $15 to $60 depending on length of time. What's that? You want to fish the salt too, pony up another $106!!! Ok soI'm now up to $371 for all my licenses and conservation tags. Now if you want to fish thae good water for salmon and steelhead it's another $20 to $40 a day for out of provincers.   $70 doesn't sound too bad does it?"
327966,xeon,2009-04-08 21:15:00,350,"You know the licence is going to be $20.00 for residents right? And the salmon licence (seeing as salmon are ANYTHING BUT FREE to stock) is an extra $10.00 to help cover the costs of the stocking. Just because their economy has hit the skids, doesnt mean that you should have to pay less for something that still costs the same. You pay 300 for a rod and reel, 20,000 for a boat, 200 for gas to get there, and you cant afford 70 for a licence?  I also guess you didnt realize the non-resident fishing licence is $70.00 for Ontario."
327988,bassfighter,2009-04-08 22:48:00,366,"Sounds like some of you guys either discriminate the americans, don't fish the NY side, or some just had a bad day and do not have positive things to say.  I am sending this info to those who buy the NY license and concern of the huge increase. If this email does not concern you, just by pass it!  I pay for the NY license every year for $40 and if the increase is close to double the original price at $70, of course we would try our best to support the person who petitoned, hoping something positive might happen.  WOULD IT HURT ANYONE TO SIGN UP TO PREVENT THE INCREASE, IF SOME PEOPLE NEED SOME SUPPORT?  WHich is more helpful to a neighbor, criticize it , or support others?"
327992,solopaddler,2009-04-08 23:00:00,8605," Actually you've got it all wrong. Nobody is discriminating against our American neighbours. Guaranteed EVERYONE who's responded in favour of the price increase buys a non resident NY licence every year. I definitely feel that residents of NY should not be hit with any increases, that's just not fair considering the current economic situation. Pile it all on the non residents! I'd gladly pay double or triple the current amount for the privelage of fishing down there! There'd be tangible benefits for all involved."
327995,bigugli,2009-04-08 23:09:00,6138,"A visitor from NY state pays $66 for the priviledge of fishing Ontario. Only fair to see the same mark up. Also, take a moment to consider how much more aggressive the NY fisheries dept. is with resource management and stocking. IT's money well spent. Ontario residents benefit directly from those efforts whether they buy the NY tag or not  Skip the emotions and look at the simple facts."
328024,FishHeadRic,2009-04-09 00:28:00,226,"  This increase in money is not going back into the fisheries. Despite what you think this is all due to Gov. Patterson's scramble to raise as much money to regain control of New York States defacit. The Salt Water Community here in NY is also for the first time being forced to get licenses. I'm not stating this as a bad thing. They should have had one a long time ago but to take money for a licence in a state and then use this money for something other then the fishery it was intended for is in my opinion just wrong! Going back to the Fresh Water License, l do think it's just wong what the're doing with this. A increase of 5-10% over 5 years maybe... but this is just a blatent display of how little control the Government down here over their economy and they're trying to pass their losses onto other states and out of state residents. lt's unfortunate that this is going on. This state has some of the BEST fishing in the world and it's truely unrealized. This increase in the out of state license is just going to deter people from coming into the state to fish. God's honest truth I think people that did fish here before should NOT buy a license here this year. Stay up there, go to another state, go to another provence... Let them know that this is not an exceptable action! Personally l feel if this state wants to raise money for their deficites then start up another lottery or have a freakin' bake sale but this is just going to keep people from making NY a vacation destination and thus doing more detrimental damage to the economy of the state and not to mention the the reputation of our great fishery!   FHR"
328025,Whopper,2009-04-09 00:28:00,2174,"Why bassfighter?  big's has it right, I'm going to pay $66 or $68 for my license plus another fee for the sportsman card this year and I'm not going to complain at all. ya play ya got to pay"
328039,OhioFisherman,2009-04-09 00:56:00,6623,"Salmon are expensive to raise, Ohio gave up long ago, money was better spent on other species. They closed the hatcheries dedicated to raising them and bought a cold water facility from a fishing club to raise steelhead.  I have fished in New York, not for Salmon or in Lake O but they do a better job managing their stuff than Ohio. It was worth the money to me to have 4 different licenses at one point. Ohio, Pa, New York and Ontario, and I kept a fish or two a year.  People think nothing of blowing a hundred bucks at a baseball or football game? For a traffic hassle and a couple- few hours? One fee and your set for the year."
328043,solopaddler,2009-04-09 01:02:00,8605, Exactly. From a purely selfish and unapologetic point of view that's one of the tangible benefits I was referring to.
328053,Rizzo,2009-04-09 01:19:00,4754,"Fishing is an expensive hobby. If you guys think an extra couple of bucks is going to deter someone from getting a license you're nuts.  If you think someone is going to travel to a different state (or province) to fish over license fees you're even more nuts. Would you really spend hundreds of dollars (or possibly thousands) on travel because one state has a license that is 20 dollars less? New York State is convenient for millions of people in southern Ontario, quite a few of whom like to fish...and for the majority of them money is not an issue. Gas from Toronto and back will cost you as much as the license. Sorry to tell you but it will be business as usual and any petition will fall on deaf ears...especially because all those signing the petition can't vote!"
328056,bassfighter,2009-04-09 01:23:00,366,"I just found this link by accident, and some local NY anglers are concern about this non residence license increase as well.  They are concern about their Canadian neighbor or those out of state, Why should they? why can't they say negative things as well?  The Main issue here is the huge percentage increase .  The final amount is secondary.....  http://www.outdoors911.com/reports/showthread.php?t=7779"
328085,bigfish1965,2009-04-09 02:02:00,3382,"Well...you just had a bunch of Canadians saying they don't mind because they know it is the price of enjoying NY's amazing fishing. We charge them about the same to fish here..so its not a big deal. Even at $70 I doubt they get back what it costs to have a non-taxpayer use their resources. Compared to other jurisdictions, it does not seem out of line...no pun intended . NY does far more than we do for the salmonid resource."
328112,bigugli,2009-04-09 03:16:00,6138, It just might be that licence fees have not kept up with the cost of running the fisheries dept.  It is a regular habit of governments to run programs without increasing the revenues. The result is a deficit that either has to be paid off or the service has to be cut. Ontario chose to reduce service.
328118,Guest skeeter99,2009-04-09 03:25:00,0,"$70 that it not to bad  imo should be a $100 or maore even in ontario, nothing is cheap it costs money to run things  $70 would just be the gas to get there and back with some food"
328123,DRIFTER_016,2009-04-09 03:37:00,10439,$28 may seem like a huge increase but if you compare it to the increase in Alaska's non-resident license it's not. When I went to Alaska in 2005 my license cost me $55 as a non-resident. When I went the following year it had increased by $90 to $145!!!!! It had nearly trippled virtually overnight.
328132,cram,2009-04-09 04:09:00,1733,$70 is very fair.....hopefully kids are cheaper (hopefully free) though.
328148,xeon,2009-04-09 09:32:00,350,"   Neither; be truthfull with them.  Fishery related stocking, research, invasive species control, enforcement, ect. programs cost hundreds of millions of dollars every year. The cost of these programs need to be covered in one way or another. Since the people who use the resources are the ones causing a need for it, they in turn, should help cover the costs of it. If you dont want to help pay for it and not fish there for a year thats your choice, but in reality your only hurting the fishery more because the government will soon cut funding to the programs because theres not enough people using it and since they are already in debt, they cannot afford to keep supporting it out of general tax payers money because there are bigger issues that win them more votes than the fish do.  I tried to make this post a bit more positive for you lol."
328183,tipupesox,2009-04-09 13:05:00,167,"Being from NYS it is about time that they raised non-resident licenses.  Let's face it, as compared to other states, a $40 dollar fee for fishing was a bargain.  Unfortunately the NY political regime is looking for places to create new revenue.  Welcome to the land of fees and taxation.  As a note, kids under 16 years of do not require a license."
328186,Billy Bob,2009-04-09 13:18:00,5865,Most of the money will be wasted on NY City spending.  I am surprised no here mentioned how we non Ontario residents have to get a outdoor card this year.
