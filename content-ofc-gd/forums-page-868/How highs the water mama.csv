328147,Big Cliff,2009-04-09 08:53:00,6899,Water level in Sturgeon Lake is the highest we have seen it since we moved here in 2001. I would say that it is at least 1' higher than any of the previous years. My shore line has taken a real beating from the wind and waves the last three days and with all this snow melting I think it will go up a bit more before it starts to drop back. MNR called off the walleye spawing observations because of the high levels and turbidity. Hopfully thinge will get back on track next week. I've got some docks to build!
328167,Jer,2009-04-09 11:55:00,1426,"I'm just hoping my dock doesn't float away...     The water is up over a foot since Sunday (when I mighta jumped the gun and put the dock down).  So far it's the second highest I've seen it, 97 or 98 was a little worse."
328177,pameladallaire,2009-04-09 12:36:00,470,DOCKS?? WATER?? My hubby is outside snowblowing!!  Pam
