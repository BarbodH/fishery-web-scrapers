I could start one if the interest is there. I dont know where online to do so other than yahoo but i don't see anything listed for the playoffs. I can set one up at ""onlinepools"" but those interested would have to send me their picks by email or PM. It does not let individual picks. Unless someone else knows of a place and willing to set it up.  If I set it up at onlinepools i'd need to know by tomorrow afternoon,  so I can set the perameters, this particular pool has to enter all the selections for each team by one moderator i believe. I have to head to TO sunday and back late monday night. So that would leave me tuesday night  to enter the teams.  Put ur name here, if there's 10 participants by this time tomorrow i'lll set it up.  Happy Easter"
