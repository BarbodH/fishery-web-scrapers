I have a Question if you all could help me.  I am wondering if anyone knows the tow weight of a 1997 17' Nitro Bass Boat package. It has a 90 hp yammy.  I would be using a 2009 Equinox v6 or 2000 dakota v6 to pull this boat.  In your expert opinion(s) is this enough guts to pull this boat. I  have a deal done and it kind of hinges on this factor.  thank you in advance for any help  you all provide, and I hope to return the favor someday."
328369,Cudz,2009-04-09 23:16:00,2652,I am no expert and I don't know what the tongue weight would be but I don't see why either of those vehicles would have an issue pulling your boat.
