327956,mistaredone,2009-04-08 20:44:00,913,"Hey all, I want to take a boat im looking at buying up in Keswick for a wet run.  I never go on the water this early so im not sure what to expect like ice or debris from the spring run off in the water ect.  Is there a preferable launch to do the test run the safest?  Thanks."
327959,tinbanger,2009-04-08 20:58:00,1028,not sure where to launch Keswick side but there is always lots of debris out on the water .everything from lumber and skids to propane bottles  hard to see even in calmer weather  What kind of boat ?  TB
327965,misfish,2009-04-08 21:14:00,29133,"Yes, watch out for anything that floats.They come up fast.   Dave ,whats with the mean looking pouch?"

328005,mistaredone,2009-04-08 23:53:00,913,I have had a mechanic look at the boat and he said everything looks great. I would feel foolish buying a boat I have never taken for a ride. Any thoughts?
328006,misfish,2009-04-08 23:54:00,29133,Who looked it over? 15ft bass boat?????????

328011,mistaredone,2009-04-09 00:02:00,913,15 footer fits in my garage.
328094,Cudz,2009-04-09 02:20:00,2652,"15"" good for the bathtub.  15' fiberglass is fine on Simcoe (possibly)"
328175,hawkeye,2009-04-09 12:29:00,162,"  There's one or two public launching points off Lake Drive in Keswick. From Ravenshoe Rd go north on Lake Drive. The first one, I believe is right near the first stop sign, and if memory serves there's another at the foot of Glenwoods  good luck with the new boat, but watch Simcoe it can get very rough very fast even on Cooks Bay never mind the main lake"
328188,cityfisher,2009-04-09 13:30:00,959, Steves a good honest guy... id take his word. watch out on cooks this time of the year .. lots of crap floating around
328328,mistaredone,2009-04-09 21:35:00,913,"LOL!  If the boats 15 inches I got ripped off real bad.  As for Steve at cover of Keswick, he was great and well priced.  It looks like I will not get my wet run after all but i will at least launch the boat to test the electronics and trolling motor.  Im picking up the boat tomorrow.   Ill post some picks as  soon as I get her home."
