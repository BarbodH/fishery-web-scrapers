328384,misfish,2009-04-09 23:54:00,29133,Wonder if they would ever have a spring season??????????????
328386,irishfield,2009-04-10 00:00:00,26272,There gonna need to thin them out sooner or later !! Have a least 20 here in the yard...
328387,ch312,2009-04-10 00:02:00,1590, i think the thought of gutting a pregnant doe would prevent most ethical hunters from a spring deer hunt  im just itching to get out there and get a bird. hopefully this year ill tag one with the crossbow...
328390,misfish,2009-04-10 00:08:00,29133,Nothing I would want to do.But Im sure we could tell the dif between a fatty and a skinny.

Kicker is my brother has 90 acres now just north of hamilton, just chock full of deer and turkeys. Problem is wife and daughters have started to name them. No way they're letting the mean uncle come in and thin the herd. My brother said no problem originally but he's out voted now 3-1  BTW nice turkey flyer out this week from BPS. Almost thought about that 20G turkey gun. Nice pistol grip benelli for a starter too."
