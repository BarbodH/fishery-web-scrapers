I'm 59 and got to see some of the greats of the late sixties and he's as good as anybody ever was in my opinion.  Blues Deluxe "

325805,Headhunter,2009-04-03 15:28:00,5703,"I hope I can still rock like them when I get that old. I can't imagine how happy Mike Anthony is, getting out from under the ego of EVH. This is a band that has talent, experience and business savy, a combination that should lead to much success and longevity... I hope! HH"
