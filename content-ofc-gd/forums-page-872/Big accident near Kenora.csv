It is now 11:45 am cdt and the higway is still closed, the traffic has backed up, according to the radio, for over 100km in both directions and the higway coming from Fort Frances through Sioux Narrows #71 has also been closed due to the traffic back up.  The radio is reporting the reason for the delay in opening the highway is due to the fact there are dangerous substances involved that were being transported by one of the trucks.  The police are hoping to have 1 lane open by 12:30 pm cdt and the entire road opened by 7PM."
