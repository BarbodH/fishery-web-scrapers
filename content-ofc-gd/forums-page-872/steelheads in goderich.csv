324971,justin-salmon,2009-04-01 18:15:00,17,im heading up there tomorrow and just wondering where to target the rainbows if the mouth of the river would hold them still or if the run when up river after all the rain we got last weekend? anyone been up there this year?
325060,timmeh,2009-04-01 21:17:00,609,well you can't fish up river past the highway 21 bridge so that will narrow your choices. I haven't been there in a while so I'm not sure how the fishing at the mouth has been.
325071,justin-salmon,2009-04-01 21:48:00,17,thanks and ya i know about highway 21 until the last weekend of april i think it is.
325105,tributaryhunter,2009-04-01 23:08:00,108,"was up there last sat around 11.00 am a run went through in the mourning and got pounded by hundreds of guys oh well got there to late, the mouth is doing fairly well good luck"
