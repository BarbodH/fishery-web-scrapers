325192,ld17,2009-04-02 01:47:00,319,admitting you have a problem is half the cure.  I have no problem.
325222,Dara,2009-04-02 02:41:00,3052,Naw..no problem...the woodworking sites are my real problem..I have this one pretty much under control
325256,TJQ,2009-04-02 04:33:00,7806, I think I love you.. and thats not a good thing.....
325274,GeorgeJ,2009-04-02 07:11:00,207,I feel the same way and that's even worse! All together now my name is... and I'm a OFNholic...
325313,Flappn,2009-04-02 12:37:00,245,Guilty. I spend a LOT of time on this site.
325382,setomonkey,2009-04-02 16:08:00,872,"I've been clean for six months since moving and changing jobs, and thought I was out of the woods.  But here I am again, with spring and thoughts of fishing on my mind...  ""Just when I thought I was out... they pull me back in.""    Mike"
325639,ld17,2009-04-03 02:58:00,319,sad news.  Work just blocked OFC today.  I'm like WHAT!  Try again blocked....oh nooooooooo.  Any way to access through back door.  This is not good..lol
325655,irishfield,2009-04-03 03:15:00,26272,"LOL... I'm thinking a lot of people have been blocked or been laid off, as I was away all day and there was only about a dozen new posts from 7:45 am to 6pm !... or maybe it was just me being away..."
325657,ld17,2009-04-03 03:17:00,319,that is a laugh.......lol
324594,GeorgeJ,2009-03-31 22:41:00,207,"I find myself with OFC  on whenever I can, I take my laptop out to the shop have OFC on keep hitting the refresh button to stay up to the latest subject matter at hand. When I'm in the car I have it on my BB, I try not to be the driver when ever I can. I wish I could comment more on fishing subjects but for now all I can do is read them and put my 2 cents in on other topics. I'm fairly new and maybe after some time it might get to a normal amount of time to spend on the computer, but I see there are some members with thousands of posts so maybe not. At least getting out and actually fishing will provide a break in the OFC addiction, but then again maybe I will have some fishing reports, Hopefully!"
324596,Leecher,2009-03-31 22:48:00,7832,"I hear ya George..... I'm as guilty as you LOL  The only time I don't look at this wonderful site is when I go out fishing and let me tell ya, if it's any consolation.... it doesn't get any better with time.... that I can tell ya LOL  So to answer your question.... we're both hooked LOL  Leechman"

324607,Terry,2009-03-31 23:12:00,14456,"boy are you lucky  you have only been hooked for about 2 months, I have been hooked for many many years, looking for the next fix, sneaking on peoples computers and deleting cookies and history on  my work  computers so no one would know how much I was on this site, oh yeah I got it bad..."
324608,Radnine,2009-03-31 23:12:00,1538,"I am in the same boat (tee he he). I think that the season definitely has a bearing on the situation. But as a for instance, I just sat down at the computer to do some work on an on-line course that I am taking and here I am! It's face book for fishermen. I too can hardly wait to post some fishing related stuff. Jim"
324609,tknohpy,2009-03-31 23:12:00,162,My fiance thinks I'm crazy...but supports my fishing obsession.
324612,GeorgeJ,2009-03-31 23:17:00,207,"oh boy I just had it on all through supper, hope my wife wasn''t talking about anything to important!"
324616,grt1,2009-03-31 23:29:00,638,"I'm not hooked I only check it 7 or 8 or 9 or14 times a day!  it's been a long cold winter and its snowing again, need I say more"
324617,douG,2009-03-31 23:32:00,2693,"Nope, nope, nope.  Cook dinner, set the table, and clear it after. Then, you can play.  See ya in chat shortly."
324618,irishfield,2009-03-31 23:32:00,26272,What ?
324625,tjsa,2009-03-31 23:41:00,1578," But, do you remember what you ate for supper?"
324626,Bernie,2009-03-31 23:44:00,3190, *burp*     O ya....spaghetti.
324629,Maverick,2009-03-31 23:48:00,371," LOL That's what I tell my gf or parents whenever I spend 500 bucks on fishing gear.  ""I could be doing drugs dad, instead I decided to get a new baitcaster, I could take it back and buy a crack pipe if you would prefer though.""  I'm on here constantly though except the summer months when I don't have internet."
324630,GeorgeJ,2009-03-31 23:49:00,207,  well there is a meat pie wrapper in the garbage so yeah I think that's what I had...
324636,Roy,2009-04-01 00:00:00,13728,"You guys are sick!! I'm here banning folks as fast as new ones are registering to try to keep costs and bandwidth usage down.  OK, you're right, it IS addictive. It's addictive because we all enjoy fishing, we've all made some friends here, we can talk about almost anything and we (some more than others) always try to help another member out with a situation or problem. Keep it up, it's nice to see folks show up for a yak anytime of the day or night.  Good stuff, thank you for being a part of it."
324644,purekgw,2009-04-01 00:18:00,585,i use my phone in class to come on lol
324645,steverowbotham,2009-04-01 00:18:00,1800," Thats what I used to tell my parents haha!  They'd say ... 300 bucks for a tournament?  I'd say, would you rather it be a fishing tournament or an 8 ball? EXACTLY! I'm glad I took the fishing route, because too many of my acquaintances chose the latter of the two."
324679,BUSTER,2009-04-01 01:23:00,1336,hello..   my name is brad and i have a problem  ummm  ummm  well its this fishing site   i..... i......       .... \\\\..\\          JUST CANT GET ENOUGH
324685,tjsa,2009-04-01 01:41:00,1578," So.............when did you find the time to look in the garbage,"
324687,ozaibak1,2009-04-01 01:48:00,401,"Well I have to say I've been using the internet ever since it became 'mainstream' in 1993. It takes a damn good site with relevant, fresh, and interesting content to keep me as a daily visitor. An even better one to make me visit several times a day. I can truly say there are only about 8 websites that accomplish this, and about four that accomplish this best, and OFC is one of them! Yes I love to fish, and have not found a site better than this one related to it. The wealth of knowledge shared here is priceless. Am I addicted? Yes, just as much as fishing to this board! But its a GREAT addiction. I just forked about 500 bucks on gear, I am a frugal spender, but have never regretted a fishing related purchase!"
324826,blaque,2009-04-01 12:02:00,2419,"Lets put it this way,  I have about 5 or 6 forums in my favorites, This is the only Canadian based forum of those 5 or 6, I Live in the U.S. (ny) Im here 90% of the time and checking my local forums 10% of the time  This place is so addicting that ive foresaken my own country lol"
324828,danbouck,2009-04-01 12:06:00,4380,"It has just become a routine for me. Get to work, go on OFC. While @ work, accomplish nothing and go on OFC. Go home and... OK I have a problem!"
325126,GBW,2009-04-01 23:43:00,8460,"It's not a problem to be on this site all day unless...heck I've got nothing... I'm here every day, ALL DAY (when I can be) and my wife & kids think I'm nut's.  So I tell her ""would you rather I surf xxx all day?"" and she replies with ""kids look at that fish on the computer""..."
325136,OhioFisherman,2009-04-02 00:05:00,6623,"Disabled and stuck home, computer chair is the most comfortable in the house for me. OFC is like home, a bit rowdy at times but a good group of people."
