324871,Pavel,2009-04-01 14:09:00,9,"I am looking at getting a new reel for an 8Wt set up for Steelhead fishing and have broken it down to:  VELOCITY 3      3.50""  1.20""  5.80 oz  7,8  WF7  150 yds 20#    OR VELOCITY 3.5    3.75""  1.30""  6.25 oz 8,9 WF9  200 yds 20#  Also, I might have to go with the cheaper model of the the two, so here are my other two choics:  RADIUS 3      3.17""  1.05""  5.0 oz  7,8  WF7  150 yds 20#  OR RADIUS 3.5   3.50""  1.20""  5.8 oz  8,9  WF9  200 yds 20#  Not sure which one to go with? If you had to choose one Velocity and one from the Radius list which would you go with? How much backing do I really need?  Thanks in advance for your help."
324877,Weekend Warrior,2009-04-01 14:17:00,27,I'd go with the larger Velocity reel. I use a 6.0oz Lamson Konic on my 9wt and it's great.
324960,pikeie,2009-04-01 17:46:00,380,i also use a 6.0 oz konic and i would not go out on the river without it. great quality reels!!  and to answer your question id go with the larger velocity aswell...
325251,Pavel,2009-04-02 04:08:00,9,Thanks for your input and I am sure to use it towards making my decision. Take care and hope you all have a great season on the river or lake.

You should also check out the Lamson Guru, it's the cheapest machined Lamson you can get and it falls in between the two you mentioned. No matter which way you go, great drag on them all."
