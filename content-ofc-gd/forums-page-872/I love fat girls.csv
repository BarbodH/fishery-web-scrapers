We have left the typical, easy to get to areas because of the pressure these pike have been feeling in the last couple of years. We were in the GTA but thats all I'm saying.

Fished with my buddy Weedlines on a couple of occasions.We had decent results with jerkbaits from shore. I guess that we have to wait a month till we can get back into them. Sorry about the background on the picture. I dont want to give away or post somebody elses ""secret"" spot.  "

I could tell you what we estimated it at, but I dont want to open that can of worms( if you know what I mean ) I am guilty of a little trick photography SNAG- I know that you know that I know that you know that I know that you know that I know about that spot.
