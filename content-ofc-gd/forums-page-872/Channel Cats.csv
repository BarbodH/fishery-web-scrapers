Does anyone know of any areas up on Southern Georgian Bay or West side that would produce some kitties. I know the water is cooler up there so I guess they would be in the rivers later than down at Erie? Any help would be appreciated, or send me a PM if you choose not to post. Thanks  Jay"

Got to believe any wide slow moving river up there could hold some, ours were incidental catches we were not really targeting them just bigger fish in general with large chubs and shiners.  Caught a number of them  up there over the years but those 2 were by far the biggest, most were 6-8 pounds?"
