The line out in feet gives me 2 numbers for each base plate setting at each desired depth.  For example: with base plate setting ""0"" and a desired depth of 10 feet it gives the numbers 21 / 18 for the amount of line out in feet.  At the far end of the scale, with base setting 3 and a desired depth of 10 feet, the line out numbers are 43 / 34.  What do the 2 numbers mean for the line out?  Please enlighten me!"
325167,Raf,2009-04-02 01:07:00,3495,"it's been a while since i looked at those charts but if i'm not mistaken, the two numbers are amount of line out with or without the snap-in ""ring"" which you can add or remove from the dipsy."
325191,NANUK,2009-04-02 01:44:00,797,"Raf is correct, if you're talking about the chart below(on the left) 4th/5th line from top explains it  http://www.luhrjensen.com/downloads/tech-r...2DipsyDiver.pdf  those depths are (roughly) calculated based on 2.5 to 3.0 MPH trolling speed with 20 lb mono,"
