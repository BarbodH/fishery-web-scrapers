323813,Dara,2009-03-29 23:06:00,3052,"Well, since I took up snowmobiling, my fishing has been severly limited.  I finally got out to a favorite lake last week.  Its a short little ride in. They call it Hilltop, but it sure is a long way down.     Fishing was a bit slow, but when you get one here, its worth it.    We had to leave early so we only ended up with 4 for the day. My son and his buddy had a blast though. Fished from about 8:30 till 3  It wasn't real cold about zero all day but we had a nippy wind.      the second biggest broke my snap swivel as I was lifting him out of the hole. I got an arm soaked to the elbow over that one. I was just hoping I didn't hit hook when my hand closed over his head.  I have an old 6 1/2 foot ultralight rod and reel I take ice fishing with me. I have been wanting to catch something worthwhile on it for a few years now. I got the 6 pounder on it. lucky thing too as the reason my swivel opened was because I had tied on a too small size. Never would have got him if not for the light rod and drag. Up here we generally just fish with a branch and hand line tied to it.  The sun came out for the trip out.     I guess this could be why they call it ""Hilltop""     and a final parting shot of Lake Superior breaking up   "
