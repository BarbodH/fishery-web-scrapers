323985,trapshooter,2009-03-30 13:25:00,1234,"I'm still staring down an 8"" hole in the ice up here.  3' of ice actually.  Here's some pics from the weekend.  Lac Seul walleye and pike.      When 1 or 2 minnows just isn't enough.    Yesterday we hit up a laker lake for a couple hours.  I got the only 2 lake trout and I'm certain that the only reason I did was because I had a flasher.   White tube jigs took both fish over 45 FOW.  It's an easy spot close to town that you can drive and walk out to on Big Vermillion Lake.      Same fish, close up.  "
