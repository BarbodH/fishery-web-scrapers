The GF and myself are heading down to Ocho Rios Jamaica and part of the deal is we go fish (and hopefully catch) for a day. Not to concerned if we drag lures around or cast the Mangroves.  Looking for a reasonable price which means I don't want to book it through the hotel with tourist mark up.  Any input would be greatly appreciated. Thanks"
325367,Guest gbfisher,2009-04-02 15:15:00,0,Take your own stuff. Not much going on in the way of fishing around there. Sure there are fishing charters....just not very good ones. Take out the small boats(paddle boats or what have you) and do your own thing. You'd be far better off.  Enjoy!

GB I like your idea, just a little worried on getting my fresh water gear salty,  although I do see that Bass Pro has a telescoping rod for $30 that could be disposable/golf bag rod afterwards.  See you in a week, with a report!  I don't leave until Monday, so keep the info coming!  Thanks Mon!"
325409,RuNnYoOzE,2009-04-02 17:52:00,270,no problem!  it's a vacation mon ....a fishing charter once in a blue moon well I say GO for it!
325420,Toronto_Angler,2009-04-02 18:26:00,698, I was in Negril and we just walked along the beach and there were guys chartering for about 60 bucks...It was a blast as the charter captains are really laid back and fun..You also get to sample some of Jamaica finest Plant life  lol
325432,muskeybugged,2009-04-02 18:58:00,282," Yeah we did Negril last year Tropical Riu, can't remember much!"
325438,Guest gbfisher,2009-04-02 19:15:00,0,Take your equipment into the shower with you.............that's if your GF doesn't mind. Keeps it salt free. Don't expect amazing deep sea fishing. JA just isn't the place to go for that. Go on a fishing trip and spend the coin. Enjoy what JA  has to offer.
325460,muskeybugged,2009-04-02 20:28:00,282,"I'll try to remember to wash off my salty rod after use!  Yeah I can't see myself spending huge coin on a fully outfitted boat.  Taking the resort Kayak, or hiring a local from the beach is more of what I'm looking at."
325461,GBW,2009-04-02 20:33:00,8460,"Keep an eye out for ""the bud man"" at the top of the falls too!"
325656,ld17,2009-04-03 03:15:00,319,"go to the ""Ask Italo"" from canadain sport fishing web page and send him your question.  He's very good a returning an answer.  You might catch a reply before you leave."
