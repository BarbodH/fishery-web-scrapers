324657,camillj,2009-04-01 00:37:00,1988,"Yep ... when I am driving (almost always) ... my rod holder is the one on the port stern side and I am normally sitting sidways (facing the port) ... of course I am watching where I am going but it would be literally looking over my shoulder to see the set up on the starboard side... so I have mounted mine (which is very simliar to yours) .. Humminbird 565 and H20C on a 10"" X 14"" piece of plywood that can literally sit on the bench across from me ... and can be moved to the floor for higher speed."
324794,pikehunter,2009-04-01 07:27:00,1659,"Yep, prop rotation is the main reason. That and prob something that dates back to ancient mariner times. You will notice that all tillers, consoles and even large cruisers are rigged this way...that is except for centre consoles.  reason why"
324802,boatman,2009-04-01 10:51:00,350," Not is simply not right. The tiller was placed on the port side of the outboard well before motors were powerful enough for prop rotation to cause a problem. It also has nothing to do with the gearshift. Outboards have had the tiller on the port side since the dawn of outboards over 100 years ago. The gearshift has only been around for 60 years. They didn't put the tiller on the port side thinking ""someday we'll have a gearshift on the starboard side."" As I said before, it is because early outboards needed so much adjusting while underway that the operator needed their ""good"" (right) hand to make the adjustments.  It is commonly excepted that controls are placed on the starboard side due to prop rotation, but that is also a function of the industry standardizing itself and the increased power of outboards since the 1950's. Prior to the 1960's you could expect to find the steering and controls in any location - port, starboard, center, fore or aft."
324862,lew,2009-04-01 13:53:00,12766," Your 100% correct boatman.  I've posted this picture before but it illustrates exactly what your talking about.  This is my dad in his 15' cedarstrip about 1955 and not only is the steering wheel on the port side, it was also located in the back seat of the boat which was quite common back then.  The motor was a 25 HP Johnson Seahorse ....that was actually green but came out brown when the picture was colored....but you can see the controls were actually 2 different levers.  One was for F-N-R and the other was the throttle.  You can also see the pully on the bottom of the steering shaft and the steel clothes line wire that connected it to the motor.  Gotta luv the good ole days   "
324919,tinbanger,2009-04-01 16:03:00,1028,thanks for posting that pic agin lew  My last boat ( 4 years ago ) an old Springbok had that cable steering as well . if someone turned the motor by hand ( esp on the trailer) the cable would come of the spool below the steering wheel Was never really ' at ease' in that boat  TB
324991,GeorgeJ,2009-04-01 19:19:00,207,"Great picture Lew, ahhh the simpler times...."
324997,boatman,2009-04-01 19:39:00,350,"That is a great picture, Lew. And your dad was a lucky man. That motor is a 1951 Johnson 25 hp. First year for that motor. It was light years ahead of everything produced before it and the largest hp outboard you could buy from OMC at the time. He would have had a hot rod."
325000,tinbanger,2009-04-01 19:42:00,1028,"Gee Lew you should have blurred the background , everyones going to know the good spots now !  TB"
325248,trapshooter,2009-04-02 03:55:00,1234,"  No worries Urban.  I just wanted to clarify what I was saying.  Lew - cool pic, I remember seeing it before."
323454,GeorgeJ,2009-03-29 03:55:00,207,"I installed my tiller style Yammy outboard onto my boat today and I know from studying the boating guide it talks about sitting on the starboard side of the boat to operate the motor. My boat has two seats at the back from which the tiller is accessible, to me it feels much more comfortable to sit on the port side of the boat and operate the outboard with my right hand. In fact the the throttle handle and the shifter are all on the front port side of the outboard making it easier to reach from the port side. I'm wondering if I'm braking any kind of rules, a mariner's code or something if I choose to operate my tiller from the port side of the boat?"
323459,danc,2009-03-29 04:05:00,4677,The hand that you are most comfortable holding your fishing rod should answer that question. Use the other hand to operate the boat.
323467,Sinker,2009-03-29 04:12:00,8692,"I sit on the starbord side, tiller in my left hand."
323479,irishfield,2009-03-29 04:27:00,26272,Me too..  
323494,camillj,2009-03-29 05:15:00,1988,yep .. me too ... I would probably prefer to sit on the other side .... but until they make a 'lefty' model.. there really isnt enough room to sit on the port side ...
323516,Spiel,2009-03-29 11:38:00,9065,I sit starboard as well. If I'm trolling rods in my right hand (did I get it right Dan?) and Camillj makes a valid point on the room issue.
323519,boatman,2009-03-29 11:46:00,350,"Sit anyway you want. The tiller is on the port side because most people are right handed. Just remember that the throttle is ""backwards"" if you sit on the port side. Its hard to keep that straight in your brain when you are controlling from the port side and you run into trouble."
323521,Bernie,2009-03-29 11:48:00,3190,"On outboards in the past it was almost a necessity to sit starboard because the gearshift was mounted on the starboard of the engine. They are difficult to reach sitting port and makes for a possible dangerous docking procedure. Also often there isn't enough room in some situations to to turn the engine far enough sitting port, the tiller handle will bump into you."
323548,John Bacon,2009-03-29 12:46:00,3277,"The original reason why boats were set up with the driver on the starboard side is because the rotation of the prop causes the boat to tilt towards the port side.  Having the weight of the driver on the starboard side helps offset this.  If you sit on the port side then both your weight and the rotational force of the prop will be combined instead of offsetting each other.  Mondern boat hulls do perform better than the older ones so this may not be a problem for your boat.  Also, as previously mentioned, clearance can be an issue if you are sitting on the same side as the tiller handle.  If the two issues above do not cause a problem and you can get used to operating the throttle from the left side; then picking the side that is more comfortable should not be an issue."
323551,Muskieman,2009-03-29 12:52:00,2472,If you sit on the right hand side you may turn right and left with no problems...if you sit on the left and steer with the right arm turning right may become a problem for tight turns... the handle may get in the way by hitting your legs or belly... at least that what happens to me.   RFS
323571,boatman,2009-03-29 13:23:00,350," That is true of why the steering is placed on the starboard side of the boat, but the earliest tiller steer rowboat motors had the tiller located either center or on the port side for righthand operators. Since old motors required a lot of adjustments when underway the operator need their ""good"" hand to make the adjustments while steering with the other."
323601,chukkk,2009-03-29 14:17:00,57,I tend to agree it was because of the shift lever. My Honda is in the center but I have an older Johnson on my sailboat that has the shift on the starboard side and would be hard to operate from the port. Other than all of the reasons listed in the post I think which ever you can reach and comfortable with is fine. Personally I have a hard time with the throttle  steering from the port.
323603,Sinker,2009-03-29 14:20:00,8692,"Running a tiller from the port side, would be similar to sitting in the passenger seat to drive a car.  Sinker"
323630,trapshooter,2009-03-29 15:44:00,1234,Left hand on the tiller always for me.  Don't think I've ever seen anyone drive one the other way.
323644,fishboy,2009-03-29 16:02:00,550,"Interesting question...I've always sat on starboard but I'm right handed. My Suzuki has the shifter on the tiller handle so it really wouldn't matter..not sure about clearance to turn though.  That being said, my chair is on the starboard side, so with my boat, no choice."
323648,gdelongchamp,2009-03-29 16:05:00,199,Tiller in the left and and right hand on the pull cord. If you are left handed you will get used to it as well.
324516,GeorgeJ,2009-03-31 19:51:00,207,"well thanks for all the replies, there is some good information. I've been sitting in the boat making motor noises trying it out sitting on both sides of the boat. I've decided to stay with tradition and till with my left hand, even though making turns to the right will be a bit of a reach, a little handle extension would be nice. I went ahead and mounted my gps, fish finder and switch panel all within reach of my right hand. "
324522,anders,2009-03-31 20:10:00,1168,"nice set up...just a question for you though.  What made you decide to mount the electronics where you did, rather than right across form you on the starboard side.  I know personally with the location there i would be turning too much, rather than mounting on the opposite side?  Just curious...no offence if taken.  Thanks"
324526,GeorgeJ,2009-03-31 20:25:00,207," No offense at all to worry about, I agonized for days and weeks on what to put where but that is the starboard side, I think maybe you meant across from me which would have been the port side in this case. Simply the reach was too far having everything on the opposite side I am tilling from, if I remember the beam is 70"" and I would have had to stand to reach control buttons and the screens were too far away to see. The seat swivels and that will help, a bit of a tiller extension would have me sitting facing almost forward, who knows when I actually get out on the water I may have to move things around."
324527,trapshooter,2009-03-31 20:26:00,1234,"I was thinking the same thing.  When you till w/ your left hand, you will be facing the port side of the boat most of the time.  At least that's where I have my graph on my tiller.  If it works for you though, that's all that matters."
324533,tinbanger,2009-03-31 20:38:00,1028,"Should have bought a side console  Just kidding , neve really thought about it before , but left hand on tiller for me !  TB"
324541,The Urban Fisherman,2009-03-31 20:49:00,2050," I have mine mounted in a similar spot to George.  I don't know about you guys but when I'm driving I tend to look forward, in the direction  my boat is going, so I just have to glance down at my graph with my eyes, no need to turn my head sideways to look at it...    I wouldn't want to run into something wile looking at my graph?"
324557,ozaibak1,2009-03-31 21:25:00,401,"From my understanding, sitting on the starboard side gives the motor a wider range of motion without interfering with your body. I don't know about a 'code' but this is what was recommended to me when starting out and it makes a lot of sense."
324560,trapshooter,2009-03-31 21:35:00,1234,"I definitely look forward but my body is facing the port side of the boat.  I just turn my head to glance at the graph when driving.   When I'm fishing I'm facing and fishing over the port side staring (fixated, lol) down at my graph.   Sounds like its a case of different strokes for different folks....although now that I think of it, big tillers come pre-equiped with a spot for mounting the graph on the port side.  Here's my rig last summer.  "
324615,The Urban Fisherman,2009-03-31 23:23:00,2050," Right on brother... Looks like a sweet setup to me!  I mostly fish from the bow of my boat, so I use the graph up front for fishing, and the one at the back is pretty much only for getting from spot to spot.  Just an FYI I wasn't purposely trying to sound sarcastic.  Cheers, UF  Ps. Nice hookset!"
