325197,Cudz,2009-04-02 01:55:00,2652,I heard a goofy rumour that we might be allowed 2 rods per person on simcoe? THis isn't true is it? I know it is April fools day but I am not trying to be funny. Any comment?
325198,Roy,2009-04-02 01:58:00,13728,"One rod, 10 rods, it's academic. There are no fish in Simcoe."
325199,Terry,2009-04-02 01:59:00,14456,"April fools   but then again, I have seen MNR do stupid things before  Nan, April fools"
325229,Cudz,2009-04-02 03:01:00,2652,"that is true.  Did you hear that everybody, there is no fish in Simcoe.  Don't bother fishing Simcoe, all the fish are gone.  That is true"
325231,Cudz,2009-04-02 03:04:00,2652,I know it is april fools but I heard this from a very unreliable source.
325233,irishfield,2009-04-02 03:16:00,26272,For a few more days if you can drill a hole Cudz... then back to one..
325242,Cudz,2009-04-02 03:45:00,2652,Yeah I thought so.  The clown probably got ice fishing and softwater fishing mixed up.  I did an internet search and came up empty so I figured I was being duped.
