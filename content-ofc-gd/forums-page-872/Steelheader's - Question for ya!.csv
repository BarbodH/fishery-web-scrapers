325531,bassjnkie,2009-04-03 00:11:00,1101,"I nomally use size 10 - 16 Kamasan for trout and match/float carp fishing. I've also use the Raven specialist and sledge hooks, Drennan and Fox match hooks with good results. You can find the Kamasan at Fish Ontario at the HWY400 service station, Raven at Bass Pro, Drennan and Fox online. Hope this helps."

324783,rbaquial,2009-04-01 04:53:00,968,"Whats the LARGEST hook that can be used for steelheads? In contrast, whats the SMALLEST?  Just a curious question...Right now I'm using size 8. Wondering if there's a need for a plethora of hooks?  Also, is there a COMMON SIZE that can be used? Or, is there a particular reason an angler would choose a LARGER hook, over a SMALLER hook for Steelhead?  Thanks OFC'ers! I hope to one day join the ""Steelheader"" group!  Still chasin' after the ""Illusive"". RoB"

324790,Sinker,2009-04-01 05:58:00,8692,8's are tooooo big!
324791,rbaquial,2009-04-01 06:00:00,968," Ok, now I'm officially confused... how does the hook-sizing/system work? It's #8 hook by Raven if that helps any...."
324792,Sinker,2009-04-01 06:02:00,8692,"bigger the number, smaller the hook.  12, 14 and maybe 16's if your running single eggs or something.......maybe a #10 if its dirty and your running bigger bait.  Sinker"
324801,muddler,2009-04-01 10:47:00,623,"Use whatever hook size you want as long as your offering looks natural and you are not sacrificing hooking power. I use size 6 on 4 inch worms, size 8 on large roe bags and pinkies, mostly 10 an 12 on small roe bags and 12 and 14 for singles.  muddler"
324804,Alumacraft,2009-04-01 11:01:00,139,"addikted you have too remember that all the hook makers use the system of the larger the # the smaller the hook but, their sizes will not be the same. A # 8 mustad 92141 is actual smaller than a size #12  raven specialist. There is even a difference in size from the same company if you look at a # 12 raven specialist and a #12 octopuss the #12 octopuss hook is much smaller.So depending on the hook maker no a #8 is not too big. I personally run Mustads 92141 in #8's also mustad 9523 in #10,12, and14's I also use Raven's specialist #10 & 12 and a #12 octopuss. Hope this clears up your confusion Rob"
324829,wallacio,2009-04-01 12:10:00,475," This is probably the best advise offered so far in this thread.   It's all about balancing hooking power vs a natural presentation as the conditions and bait  dictate.    S. Ontario steelheaders are notorious for ""over-finessing"" everything from leader strength to shot size to hook size.    Guys in Michigan laugh at us when we use ""tiny"" size 8 and 10 hooks.   In fact, when Solopaddler and I were fishing the lower Manistee last fall we were running size 2's or even larger as we were using big huge bags for incredibly hot, aggressive fish.   Using anything less meant a lot of pulled hooks, or even straightened hooks when really trying to muscle a hot fish.    On the otherhand, if you are targetting spooky fish in clear water with single eggs, 14's or 16's are the way to go.  Personally I generally follow what Muddler has described with Daiichi 1150's in size 10 being my go-to hook when fishing with roe under ideal or ""green"" conditions."
324851,BillM,2009-04-01 13:12:00,17367,"I usually run 12 or 14's...  If I am running bags of death for stupid Lake E fish I'll use an 8...  Just size it with your bait, if you are running big bags or skein like Dave mentioned, you need to upsize your hooks....  Also instead of just looping the hook through the top of the bag, I usually pull it through a bit and hook the tip through the side of the bag as well.  Make's it as snagless as possible."
324861,Garnet,2009-04-01 13:51:00,2056,"I use Redwing Sabre hook, basically make the hook 1/2 the size of roe bag. I put a little exacter  bend in the hook and when you do this you find out how tough this hook is. You won't bend these hooks removing them from fish.  Garnet"
324885,kemper,2009-04-01 14:40:00,2232,"I always used to use daiichi size 12s, but after a ton of pulled hooks two weekends ago (I went 1 for 7 on thursday and 2 for 9 on friday)  I switched it up to a size 14 raven specialist and landed 90% last weekend.  I find the raven hooks to be larger than most others...also from personal experience DO NOT use the raven sedge hooks, i found them completely useless and I broke two hooks on a 4 lb lead in one day."
324893,DRIFTER_016,2009-04-01 14:57:00,10439,"Being old school when I was back in TO I was running Eagle Claw style 42's in sizes 10, 12 and 14. When I started fishing in bigger flows out west I changed to Gami Octopus hooks in sizes 6 and 8 as I was continually straightening hooks with the old 42's even after stepping up to size 6's. I havent straightened a hook since. Out east you can get away with smaller hooks in the smaller tribs. Use something like a 14 for running single eggs."
324904,centerpin_drift,2009-04-01 15:30:00,94,"i use purely Daiichi 1150 high carbon, size 12 shipped up from from a kentucky fly shop thats the only one that carries them anymore.  i always use #12, even while floating a 8 inch worm down the river or roe  bag or a single egg.  any bigger hook, i feel ruins the natural presentation of a bait, depending on how many GPM the river is pushing.  Oddly enough, i use bigger hooks like #10  B420 while floating or bouncing for specks, unless im fly fishing for specks, than i switch to #14, #16 dry fly.  everyone's different, you'll find what works for you with time.  cheers mike"
