323301,Burtess,2009-03-28 20:27:00,901,"Looking for a picnic table kit, like a box of 2X4 already cut with instructions to build a picnic table.  I have searched Home Depot, Rona, Canadian Tire, and have come up empty.  Not looking for plans to build one, if its not already cut, its going to be crooked lol...  Burt"

323322,Radnine,2009-03-28 21:15:00,1538,Let me know if you can't find a kit. Perhaps the construction teacher at your local high school would be interested in building you one (Highland the good). Jim
