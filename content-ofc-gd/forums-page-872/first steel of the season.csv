324381,centerpin_drift,2009-03-31 13:03:00,94,"so i finally quit shed hunting long enough to go float my local river, and after all the city folk stopped crowding up the bank,  i finally was able to land a few nice chromers fresh from the bay.  The water just started to clear up, and i was able to get 4 nice fish on the bank in less than an hour.  the first of the evening     few drifts later this nice hen hit   this little guy was the hardest fighter of them all   a few drifts later     and its only the start. keep your tip up.  cheers mike"

324440,lucabrasi,2009-03-31 15:36:00,114,Great Report and beauty fish! Makes me wanna get my butt up there and fast. Thanks!
324441,BillM,2009-03-31 15:40:00,17367," Not on that river...  There is maybe a 200ft section down to the mouth that you are allowed to fish..  Now picking the right side is a different matter, lol"
324444,Leecher,2009-03-31 15:57:00,7832,Great report and pics mike  Real nice steel for sure!!!  Congratulations and thanks for sharing Leechman
324445,jdmls,2009-03-31 16:24:00,575,"nice report, I luv those footballs that river produces !!!.... I have to take a drive nord instead of east very soon"
324474,msp,2009-03-31 17:34:00,1336,"   Not really!  Anyways, nice fish ya got there.Its funny how the little guys can scrap like they are on steroids."
324495,BillM,2009-03-31 18:41:00,17367, Nothing beats a GBay/Huron trib fish...
324536,maple_leaf_drifter,2009-03-31 20:46:00,8,"Geogian bay/huron tribs hold some of the best steelhead fishing in ontario, and the are edible, thats more than you can say about lake o fish.  The run up this way hasnt really started yet, although lots of nice fish are getting caught, should be picking up after a bit more rain.  Its defintally a cold one fishing that mouth.."
324553,buckster,2009-03-31 21:09:00,530,The reason city folk crowd the bank is because of posts like this!
324564,BillM,2009-03-31 21:42:00,17367,"  There are always crowds here, you think one post is somehow going to make it any worse?  OMG SOME SHAKERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  LETS PACK THE KIDS UP AND GO!!!!!!  :shakes head:"
324587,buckster,2009-03-31 22:24:00,530,  Yup seen it with my own eyes!   WoW u know what shakers are....  u got the lingo down!  Not bad for someone that has been steelheading for 4 days
324633,silvio,2009-03-31 23:53:00,433,Nice pics bud.
324717,BillM,2009-04-01 02:58:00,17367," I only got out 3 days last week, not 4"
324806,MCTFisher9120,2009-04-01 11:07:00,3761,Awesome job dude.  Thanks for sharing!
325270,eyeforelle,2009-04-02 05:38:00,38,"whats wrong with city folk fishing the northern rivers? do the local northern boys have the deeds to the rivers up there or something. some of the best fishermen i know of that seem to always out fish the local ""critters"" live in the city. i myself would rather catch 3 fish from a g.bay/lake h. trib. than 10 fish from an eastern river anyday."
325353,figureight,2009-04-02 14:26:00,40,Kind of funny how you complain about the city folk and crowds and then go about posting an internet report of your home river.
