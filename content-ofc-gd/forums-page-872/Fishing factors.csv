324841,HUKDONFAWNIX,2009-04-01 12:58:00,135,How would you rank the following factors when fishing for Pike................  Lure action Colour Speed Depth  Thanks.
325160,msp,2009-04-02 00:52:00,1336,"I think that they are all factors when targeting pike. If I had to pick one,I think that I would pick speed. Many of my pike patterns have been put together starting with speed. Experimenting is the key factor."
325163,richyb,2009-04-02 00:56:00,774,I would pick speed. Sluggish fish slow it down and active fish i love to burn it ..

325207,snag,2009-04-02 02:13:00,1932,Depth Speed Lure action Colour   Whatever Terry!!!!!
325319,OhioFisherman,2009-04-02 12:43:00,6623,"Follow Terry and Snag, Depth #1 you can`t catch them if they aren`t there."
325414,Ramble,2009-04-02 18:13:00,713,"Water temp #1.....often associated with depth and wind.  For me lure action is as important as speed if not more so.  Then colour.  Obviously structure and temperture combined outrank all the others. You can have the best pike bait on the face of the planet, but if they you aren't where they are it wont matter."
