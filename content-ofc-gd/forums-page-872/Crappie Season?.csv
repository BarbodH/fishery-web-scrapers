325636,Cudz,2009-04-03 02:57:00,2652,I have read the regs for zone 16 and I have come to the conclusion that crappie is open all year round.  The reason I am questioning this is that I read on another thread that there was opening day for crappie. Am I legal to fish for crappie right now?  I read the exceptions and could not find a statement that would suggest otherwise. thanks

325643,Cudz,2009-04-03 03:00:00,2652,Thanks.  I also studied zone 15 as well and there didn't look like there was a closed season there either.
