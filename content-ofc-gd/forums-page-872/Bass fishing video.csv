324719,Mike the Pike,2009-04-01 03:01:00,3421,Very informative video.I have some of those frogs but have not caught with them yet.
324812,OhioFisherman,2009-04-01 11:28:00,6623,"Ya hook up percentage on frogs can be pretty bad at times, always wait until you feel the weight of the fish on the line to set the hook and if it misses it completely just stop the retrieve, wait a few seconds and give it a twitch or two. The fish might hit again.  Although I didn`t use braid it is probably a better option now for the reasons mentioned in the video."
324813,MCTFisher9120,2009-04-01 11:35:00,3761,"Good video, i was using mono last year and this is why i caught no fish on my frog...i got some braid now for some semi thick weeds."
324816,Lunker777,2009-04-01 11:42:00,866,"I fished the frog quite a bit last year. Caught a few fish, nothing to special tho. We were using them in about 3ft of water late in the summer at night. It was awesome ! haha I love the feeling of top water fishing.... when that spash happens ! ADRENALIN !"
324941,cram,2009-04-01 16:35:00,1733,"Unless you're fishing in slop, there's nothing a rubber frog will do that a popper, jitterbug, or spook-style bait won't do much better."
324986,gogu392,2009-04-01 19:03:00,142,Good video. The only element missing is pobably the scent.
324989,misfish,2009-04-01 19:13:00,29133,The frog rocks.Love it in the heavy cover slop and pads. No better excitment then seein that splash then the wieght.  TFS the vid.
325028,MCTFisher9120,2009-04-01 20:30:00,3761,  Really  hmm by this you mean adding some right...never tried that with a topwater bait b4
