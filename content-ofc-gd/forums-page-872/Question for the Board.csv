324756,bigfish1965,2009-04-01 03:49:00,3382," Slot limits and seasons force us to release dead fish all the time. If you want to make an argument based on ethics, it is a tough road. Some would question the ethics of fishing during the spawn. Some see no problem with it. I would imagine portable livewells will be very popular very soon."
324811,Spiel,2009-04-01 11:27:00,9065,  Then you stop fishing? Or do you carry on and possibly get a third bleeder.....then what?
324814,DMASSE,2009-04-01 11:35:00,420,"Hello  Well I have always wondered this very question...     Yesterday I was talking to MITCH PHINNLEY  from the Durham REGION MNR CO...  and i asked him this very question.  His reponse is  You are allowed to keep fishiing even if you have obtained your daily speices limit,  in this case 2 stream - rainbow trout,  you are still allowed to obtain your other limits of trout ie Browns,  specks etc etc  with the daily limit of 5 trout total,  if you obtain this limitof trout,  you are required to release all and any other trout back into the water in a timely matter...  therefore allowed too keep fishing with a catch and release only  Hope this helps  If you would like Mitch's phone number it can be provided on request  Dave"
324864,Guest gbfisher,2009-04-01 13:59:00,0,Love how some people think they understand their own ethics and give reasons for doing things the way they do.    .............and expect others to do the same... Sounds like a crazy mixed up organization to me. One that all hunters and fishermen despise.
324884,danc,2009-04-01 14:33:00,4677,"Culling is not an option in the waters where I fish. There's a zero live possession rule in effect. You keep it, you kill it. Don't be caught with a live fish."
324887,Zubris21,2009-04-01 14:43:00,563,"I don't think it is un-ethical at all to keep fishing once you have hit (and kept) your limit.  Sure there may be problems with catching subsequent bleeders, and it is a sad situation, but certainly no angler with a mind for conservation would feel good about this.  In my opinion once you purchase your license whether it be sport or conservation, your are purchasing your right to fish any species (with possibly a few exceptions I can't say I've completely examined the regs 100%).  I don't think it is unethical to fish for a zero possesion limit, ie sturgeon, or muskie on a conservation license, as long as it's C&R, as these are the terms of the agreement you signed when you bought your license.  Poaching comes in the effect when you are fishing out of bounds (in sanctuaries), out of season, or retaining fish in the slot or above and beyond your limit.  I have not had many encounters with CO's but I believe them to be reasonable people.  I.E. I would be shocked if I was charged for taking a picture of a giant muskie, in no possesion lakes, or even fishing with only my conservation license.  I would have no intention on keeping the fish at all, and would know that going in, sure the CO might, but if the stuck around 2 mins, they would see the fish put back in the water, and should ease any concerns they may have."
325006,Terry,2009-04-01 19:54:00,14456,"well  in your eyes it could be  unethical to keep fishing because 'ethics"" is a personal thing and you should live by your ethics, just don't try to impose your moral on others, they have their own ethics to live by but the law clearly states that you can keep fishing, so if you feel it's ok to keep fishing then keep fishing  I do with the MNR cos could get it together and  learn to read, so we would have one law and one interpretation"
325023,MCTFisher9120,2009-04-01 20:27:00,3761,I think it's fine also. I have caught(not a limit) but a few fish and kept them on the stringer for a few hours then kept on fishing using C/R...As long as he/she is releasing the fish there is no harm done.
325059,GBW,2009-04-01 21:14:00,8460,"Dave, can you PM me ""MITCH PHINNLEY from the Durham REGION MNR CO"" info?  Thanks! Geoff"

325130,Guest steel'n'esox,2009-04-01 23:45:00,0,"Seen a guy do that on the ganny caught his 2 fish, kept on fishing said he was now after browns, until he got ridiculed and harrassed off the river never to be seen again. Seem some people are always trying to bend the rules which the mnr sets out which at times are not too clear and concise"
325139,Tomcat,2009-04-02 00:09:00,395,"It doesn't really matter if the COs across the province have different interpretations because apparently, most fishermen don't share the same interpretations either."
325219,bigfish1965,2009-04-02 02:37:00,3382," No one was bending any rule. No where does it state you have to stop fishing when you have a limit. No where does it state you cannot fish for fish with zero possession limits. No where does it state you cannot fish for slot limit fish. If they are in season and in a legal place you can fish. Period. It is not implied or stated. The MNR does not set the rules, Parliament does. The Act(s) is the rules, the MNR publications are summaries and are NOT the rules...they are the Cole's Notes of the laws."
325237,Zubris21,2009-04-02 03:27:00,563,"  Rick, I was wondering if you would be able to post a weblink to the Act(s) you are referring to so we can have a glance at them.   I'm on your side, and even from the mnr publications I can't find anything that states any different than what you just said."

325243,BassAsin,2009-04-02 03:45:00,806,was that CO's name Dave Kunkle? by any means?
325247,Cudz,2009-04-02 03:55:00,2652,If he already has two on the stringer I say fish all you want but I better not see that third one on there.
324693,eyefish,2009-04-01 02:12:00,135,"I would like to know what everyones take is on this subject.  An angler's daily possesion limit on the rivers is 2 fish right. If One of the board members witnessed an angler catch 2 fish and keep them both..(which is entirely legal and I have no problem with I guess). Would you expect this angler to leave the river with fish in tow, or would you be ok with watching this angler continue to catch fish after fish. I personally would expect this angler to leave and go home with his 2 fish.  Any thoughts?  Todd Crowley"
324694,walleyejigger,2009-04-01 02:15:00,876,i think said angler would be poaching as he would technically be in possession of another fish before he releases it ( if he caught another)
324695,DRIFTER_016,2009-04-01 02:16:00,10439,By law you are supposed to stop fishing when you have retained your limit. That is why when I am keep ing fish I don't fill out my limit until late in the day.
324701,kickingfrog,2009-04-01 02:28:00,8333,  That's not the way the Ontario regs are written.   http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/198219.pdf   Fourth page top right.
324706,walleyejigger,2009-04-01 02:33:00,876,"thanx kicking frog, learn somethin new everyday"
324707,Joey,2009-04-01 02:33:00,9122,"I see lots of people continue to fish after they have their limit.  The do catch and release.  Some people never keep any fish all day doing catch and release, how is that any different?  I see no problem with it.  Joey"
324708,Mike the Pike,2009-04-01 02:37:00,3421, I agree with you Joey.But what would they MNR do if they caught someone.Big$$$$$perhaps
324712,eyefish,2009-04-01 02:40:00,135,The reason why it would be different is because the person that is practising catch and release only never has in their possesion more than than the limit.  WOW I'm with jigger learn something new everyday!
324715,Mike the Pike,2009-04-01 02:45:00,3421,Question is can you fish or are you allowed to fish for another species.But you can't control what bites the line.
324718,irishfield,2009-04-01 03:00:00,26272," Yah.. but you were there for the lecture Rob! Remember we have CO's that feel if you net or lift the fish out of the water you have possessed it and have not immediately released it. Take a picture of a zero possession fish and he'll charge you for sure... at least Bruce Ward out of Midland will if it's a Muskie ! So in this case his ""rules"" would apply to someone already retaining their limit.  Why many anglers live release in the hole on simcoe, when still fishing for the other species, after getting their two whities or lakers."
324729,kickingfrog,2009-04-01 03:15:00,8333," I wasn't there for that one, I think it was Glen, I missed the pm that day.  Just shows that the CO's don't read the regs either."
324731,irishfield,2009-04-01 03:17:00,26272,I thought it was the day we were all together... guess it was just me and Glen. Asked the CO on Nippissing the same question last summer and he told me it was what they were being preached out of Peterborough.
324732,fishboy,2009-04-01 03:18:00,550,"I've been told by a CO as long as you immediately release you're ok...sounds like the problem is in how each CO views ""immediate""..."
324735,bigfish1965,2009-04-01 03:21:00,3382,"It is the same if you had 4 in the freezer at home. You can fish all you want, but the fish go back. Remember, these are possession limits, not catch limits. You can also fish musky with a conservation license, you just can't keep one. Some say that is unethical..but it is not illegal. Anyone telling you otherwise should be told to charge you or leave you alone. There is nothing in the Act that defines immediately releasing..it is only in the summaries and even there it implies that taking a pic of a fish you cannot possess is fine. Otherwise pics of fish in the slot could not be photographed."
324737,BillM,2009-04-01 03:22:00,17367," Yup, that's the prob..  It's up to the CO if he is going to charge you with possession if you take the fish out of the water for a pic, etc.  Personally I think if you catch your 2, you should be done for the day."
324739,GBW,2009-04-01 03:25:00,8460,good point!  Some person could be in the river looking for a steelhead or 2 and the change over to trying to catch suckers for pike/musky fishing but be seen by a CO with another steelhead on the line (that does get put back right away) and cause problems...
324740,xeon,2009-04-01 03:25:00,350,"Your limit is 2, this doesnt include released. If your not going to be keeping anymore, keep on fishing unless it was illegal (which its not). If worst comes to worse just say your catching atlantics. No CO would ever charge you with being in possesion of a fish if its in your net, thats ridiculous. Its the same thing if you acidentially snag a fish and are about to throw it back. They are reasonable people. What if you catch a sturgeon and you throw it back, no way you can get charged for that unless it was caught on purpose.  And he can catch and release all he wants after, maybe he just needs to kill an afternoon. He payed $20 to go fishing for the year, let him."
324741,irishfield,2009-04-01 03:25:00,26272,"Exactly Rick... and Zero possession fish like Sturgeon.. I always ask the CO but what about that??? and they never answer that one. Just harp about how the Muskie better not be brought aboard or held for a picture if you only have a conservation licence. Then I go to the glove box and give them a copy of the letter I have from the CO's and biologist out of the North Bay office, for them to take home and read in the can, that states they'd never even think of charging someone for taking a picture of an OOS fish... or they'd have to charge the guy that catches and releases all day as it's no different.  Dang... here we are in this again... lol"
324743,irishfield,2009-04-01 03:27:00,26272,  I presume you meant to say if you KEEP your 2...   ... but what's the difference if you catch and release 20 all day... or keep the first 2 and release the next 18. Same mortality rate in either case..
324748,bigfish1965,2009-04-01 03:33:00,3382,"I'd ask the CO where in the Act it says what he is stating. The summaries are not the law, the Act is. The Act makes no reference to these situations. It merely says you cannot possess the fish and possession is loosely defined by case law as handling of the fish so that a reasonable person could determine release is not intended. Putting the fish on a stringer is an example...but with the new culling laws, as long as you have a livewell, you are good to go all day."
324749,DRIFTER_016,2009-04-01 03:34:00,10439, The difference would be if you already have two on the stringer you have no wiggle room incase you catch a bleeder. So yes you could release your dead bleeder but if you only had one fish on your stringer you could add that bleeder to your stringer and not waste a fish or be unspotsman like by releasing a fish that is for sure going to die.
324751,irishfield,2009-04-01 03:39:00,26272,"I hear ya Drifter, I'm just playing devils advocate..... but there's no law against that. In fact it's mandatory by law to shove them dead... co ck mouthed slot sized pickeral back down the hole in the winter."
324752,BillM,2009-04-01 03:41:00,17367," Whoops, yeah I meant keep.  How would the mortality rates be the same if you were never allowed to sink hooks into those 18 other fish?  The math doesn't add up."
324754,irishfield,2009-04-01 03:44:00,26272,You telling me that after you catch and release 2 Bill you stop for the day?  Didn't think so..  So if you catch 20 and let them all go...statistics say about to 15% to 20% die... lets say 4  If you keep 2 and release the next 18... there may be 3 or 4 dead as well...heck maybe 5!
324755,BillM,2009-04-01 03:48:00,17367,"Wayne, I think you missed my point.  I was saying if it was illegal to keep fishing after your limit of two, the mortality rates wouldn't be the same.  Hell, maybe I'd be killing more fish by NOT keeping any  lol"
