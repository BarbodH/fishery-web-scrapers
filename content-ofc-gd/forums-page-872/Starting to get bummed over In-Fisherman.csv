325214,DRIFTER_016,2009-04-02 02:26:00,10439,I gave up on it quite a few years ago when they had that big price increase.
325282,singingdog,2009-04-02 11:01:00,1047,"Yea, the swimbait thing is getting a little tired. I believe in swimbaits, although I haven't had near the luck with them on walleye that he claims, but you are right: write an article about them and move on.  One of my beefs is the obvious Berkley slant to the entire mag: according to them Gulp will catch anything that swims, outfish all other presentations, and make you better looking in the process."

325427,doubleheader,2009-04-02 18:48:00,497,"I agree with all the above. Nothing but a big advertisement , and a boring one at that. Too bad, I used to think it was the number one show. Not too impressed with the magazine either."

325529,PERCHER,2009-04-03 00:10:00,787,I gave up On him the day I met him.I gave him a lone of my boat a few years back when it was brand spanking new so he could do a fall Quinte walleye shoot.When I arrived and was itroduced to him I got a backwards hand shake and not even a thanks for the loan of the boat.His camera crew on the other hand where a great gang of guys.He said he would send me a copy of the show but that never happened.I had to email Infisherman ask them for a copy.You know with all his sponsors he has he could have at least left a jacket a hat or even a rod and real in the boat for a thank you gift.After all I delivered the boat all the way from Burlington to Quinte and then had to drive all the way back to get it. Anyways that's my own fault for trying to help out. Dan
