Get ready for another debt repayment, even though it was our tax dollars trying to hold it together. And why would they allow it to go down? Just like taxes, once they are implemented, the governing body(ies) that follow know that it would be foolish to recind such a cash cow.  As far as people making a buck goes, public sector moneys and earnings should most definately be capped off. It is a public sector job after all. If you want a job that pays really big money, you should have to go out and compete for it. If you want the security of a public sector job, I think that going in, you should be made aware of the ceiling for your earnings. Private sector gigs are different. Competition is fierce and the most qualified candidates should be paid as such. Big money CEOs for the most part deserve what they get IMO."

Who do you think it is that decides on the compensation of top execs?  Top execs do.  Those guys are giving THEMSELVES those bonuses, and we all pay for it as end consumers.  That's a problem.  Another thing that people tend cling to is this notion that ""top talent"" such as these CEOs and executives are in incredibly short supply, and must be paid hansomely if you want to attract and retain them.  I think that's nonsence.  Anybody who's worked for a living knows that going around with an attitude that you are somehow irreplaceable is nothing short of a delusion.  Everyone is replaceable.  There's nothing super-human about those guys.  Sure, some of them are really smart and worked hard to get where they are.  But we all know that in the real world, a lot of people get where they are because they're friends with the right people, or have done an effective job of snowing (with Bull and butt-kissing) the right people.  We've all had at least a couple of bosses that fit this description.  Am I right?

They tell us to cut back on our usage to save money then they raise the rates because revenue was going down and costs were going up. They tell us that we are only paying 5.9 cents PKWH but when you add in the cost to get it to them, the cost to get it to us, the debt retirement charge and the taxes on the dollars that I had left after the took away my income tax it works out to be closer to 15 cents per KWHR.

324808,OhioFisherman,2009-04-01 11:14:00,6623,"We are all aware of our auto worker debates so keep it civil. Just a different way of thinking between management in our countries and some others? Our management seems to be drive by greed?  http://www.forbes.com/forbes/2006/0904/112.html  The lean and compact Fukui, like all of his predecessors, is an engineer who started in R&D and later ran the subsidiary. While other auto chief-executives-to-be were punching keyboards in an accounting office, Fukui ran the company's motorcycle racing operations. He's still racing. He hikes the stairs to his tenth-floor desk--tenth floor so he's in the middle of things at Honda's 16-story Tokyo headquarters and a desk because executives at Honda don't have offices. Honda doesn't disclose executive pay in detail, but the sum of salaries and bonuses that Fukui shares with 36 board members, $13 million, is just about enough for the boss at a big American company.  Says a lot when the top 36 guys at Honda make as much a only one top guy at GM? Certainly part of the problem here with the bailouts. I have no problems with keeping the Ameican auto companies in business for the most part. But to use our tax dollars to pay bloated salaries for the failed execs?  Again more of a wide spread problem here just because of the number of people and amount of money changing hands. I think here every CEO thinks he deserves 10-20 million a year.  We do have some good sites to track the campaign contributions, and it`s the same old story, follow the money. You can get a good idea of who is supporting who by the money trail.

In order to attract a talent level capable of managing an enterprise like hydro or what ever, you have to pay competitve salary's to the private sector. Personally, I would rather have a highly educated, qualified individual running these corporations, than a low paid person, attemping to do the job. Now, before you all get high and mighty on me, I'm not say we are getting value for our money, I'm just saying that those types of positions carry a very high profile and mistakes can cost us, the public a great deal of time, money and well crap! Public corps have to compete with the private sector to get the best talent. 2. WE ARE NOT GETTING OUR MONEY'S WORTH! I don't think I would have a problem with those high salaries if we were getting our money's worth. Mis-management and government tinkering has made many of these public corps disfunctional. HH"

324866,OhioFisherman,2009-04-01 14:04:00,6623,"Headhunter, while I don`t disagree that people capable of running a large corporation well should be paid well, the same old question arises, when is enough, enough? Honda Motors, an apparently well run corporation feels 13 million is enough for 36 executives. They also apparently have no issues working for that sum.  When a company or group of companies goes to the government, and taxpayers to bail them out of self inflicted problems, isn`t it time to rethink the salary positioning? Is it better to hire 5 people, delegate the authority, to get opposing view on a business decision or allow one extremely high paid exec to run the road to ruin?  Also a factor is some of the people that sit on these boards that make these type of decisions sit on the boards for many companies. In part the ""old boy"" network, you appoint me here, I will appoint you there. Very lucrative work? If you can get it? A recent story here of board members making 270,000 a year, for 9 days a year of meetings. 30,000 a day?  And then stories like this   http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/conte...9033101459.html  At what point do you risk alienating your customers and employees? If these same CEO`s want to make the argument it is a global economy? Why doesn`t their pay reflect that? I personally would have no problem with our government capping CEO`s pay. They made the argument for global trade, if your going to talk the talk? walk the walk? Or use money and influence to buy your positioning?  Why should US auto execs, given their history, feel that they should earn more than the execs at Honda or Toyota? Why should a US defense contractor pay it`s CEO millions? when it is the taxpayer footing the bill? Because the right political contribution allows it?  Why does our government allow our drugs companies to pay their execs millions, and charge higher prices for the same drugs that Canada buys? Canada can negotiate drug price with our drug companies? But our government blocked the same option for our taxpayers?  Just my view things need some adjustment, I don`t buy a product or service with the idea of overpaying an exec because he wants it. You have to believe if our president wanted that kind of money we could find someone to do the job cheaper, and possibly better."

The best minds in politics now, are generally people who have succeeded in private business and have no real need for money. Atleast to my mind, that would be ideal. Bringing those talents to the public sector IMHO can only benefit the public. Salary should be commensurate with accomplishments. I guess I have a different perspective on things as in my day to day work, I have the opportunity to work with some of the very best at what they do and yes, by in large, they are handsomely paid. But when you equate the value they bring to their organizations, they are worth every penny.

Some of our big companies are so bloated with levels of labour, administration, management etc that the salaries at the top of the hierarchy are bound to be pretty crazy. Arguably the folks receiving the big salaries aren't actually worth the money but how can they be expected to take less than the people below them in the totem who assume less responsibility etc? And every once in a while the person at the top is actually a leader and perhaps worth the big bux.  Besides, we're a materialistic society, and our success is judged by the size of our pay cheque and the size of our toys. The big number on those guys' cheques is more about their position of eminence rather than what they're really worth.

324973,Tomcat,2009-04-01 18:21:00,395,"The stranded debt that we hydro customers have been paying off with each hydro bill started out at 19.4 billion back in 2000.  The last time I contacted Hydro for information about the size of the stranded debt was in Jan 2007. Their response included a statement that as of 31 Mar 06, the stranded debt was 19.3 billion. WOW!  When you consider the amount of dollars paid towards the Debt Retirement Charge (DRC) every year by we consumers, you’d wonder why the stranded debt doesn’t decrease (you know – the way your mortgage principle decreases with payments). The reason this DRC does not decrease as rapidly as we would expect is that “the powers to be” keep adding to the debt.  Back then, the OEFC estimated that the residual stranded debt would be paid off between 2012 and 2020. Whoever prognosticated 2012 was obviously dreaming in technicolour."
