325074,Garnet,2009-04-01 22:00:00,2056,"This is way back in the day.  Access no problem New York State has right aways along the Salmon.  You need cleats theirs a slime on the rocks that's worst than ice.  Get the phone # for the hydro electric dam, it's a recording that tells you when the waters coming up. Do not make 1 exacter cast or you will learn tap dancing in waders and cleats.  Go north from Pulaski to Port Ontario Hwy 3 and turn right Little Salmon is good fishing.  Allways fall fished so I don't know about runs.  The Black gets large walleye runs.  Garnet"
325113,charlied,2009-04-01 23:20:00,584,can get your licence at any walmart in the states!
325132,justin elia,2009-04-01 23:51:00,151,"Go to the New York DEC website.  They have a lot of information about the different tributaries, access, maps, parking spots etc.  A little homework will pay dividends.  Good luck!   Ps.  They even have a fishing hotline"

325388,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-04-02 16:17:00,0,keener secretly followed evan and i up the nipigon one night so perhaps he owes me one.
325395,ranger520vx,2009-04-02 16:39:00,164,Its a place I frequent. Don't wait too long..its on fire there now.  Access is the best around with parking at over 20 named holes. Numerous tackle shops and motels in town.  Heres a recent piece I did on Pulaski.   Salmon River
325406,Garnet,2009-04-02 17:19:00,2056,Hey Mark  Just above that bridge is were I learned the fat guy can dance just one drift more drift and I can dance.  The Salmon is a big river just break it down to your experience pick a spot that looks like Bowmanville or the credit most of the best fishing is right infront of you. After you get comfortable fire for the middle.  Back in the middle 80's when I was going most rainbows were stocked and noticeably stupid as grass guess why I liked it.  Don't go to the hatchery it just gives you nightmares.  Garnet
325436,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-04-02 19:08:00,0, hey!  i read that piece last night.  if you have any specific locations i could try it would be awesome.  i'm working every day while i'm there so i don't have a ton of time to experiment. my experience is in fishing the st. mary's rapids and tribs of lake superior predominantly....
