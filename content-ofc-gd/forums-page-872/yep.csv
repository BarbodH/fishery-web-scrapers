325437,John,2009-04-02 19:11:00,2956," Coriander is the spice, (seeds), Cilantro is the herb, (leaves). Quite a different taste. Add the cilantro right at the end so that it flavours but does not cook. Also, ginger root, grated, is a must!"
325439,Leecher,2009-04-02 19:17:00,7832," Beauty Raf Looking at the first pic, must of been a blast to fight that thing on light tackle"

325494,Guest gbfisher,2009-04-02 22:38:00,0,on ice last weekend...in boat this weekend. ....
325507,Beans,2009-04-02 23:13:00,3339,Terrific report Raf...  Great to see JP...  Haven't seen him since a bunch of us got together outside Hooter's in Barrie...      Cheers!!!...Guys
325644,fishboy,2009-04-03 03:01:00,550,those are some serious fish-nice work
325743,Raf,2009-04-03 13:25:00,3495," they are a lot of fun on light tackle.  problem is the length of time it takes to bring 'em in and get your lure (1/64oz jighead) back down to 70'.. when you know there's more fish down there.  your buddy who's using a spoon can get 3 fish in that time   I do prefer red however, red doesn't go too well with spicy food.  something about the tannins.   sunofa... we might be picking up a ""beater"" late fall/winter boat this wknd.  still ice where we are."
325756,suds,2009-04-03 13:52:00,70,"Hey that's how i cook up my perch, then served on rice noodles.  Don't forget the thai basil. I always add the basil and the cilantro right at the end. Stir it in for a sec or two and serve....  Great post, nice fish!!   suds"

324996,Terry,2009-04-01 19:37:00,14456,looks like some great fishing trips there
325005,highdrifter,2009-04-01 19:47:00,2534, OOH Exotique!!  Do ya just eye ball the ingredients or do the amounts have to be exact?  thanks budday
325015,TroutnMuskieHunter,2009-04-01 20:18:00,1362,Some nice trout you caught there....thanks!
325026,Raf,2009-04-01 20:30:00,3495," No I haven't.. but this year I have my own backyard and a bbq..  sounds good, I'll have to try.   I eyeball things.  Exact would be too tedious haha.  partial list of ingredients would be:  shallots lemon grass fish sauce green curry paste kaffir lime leaves hot peppers coconut milk brown sugar  meat & veggies of your choosing..  i pound some of the shallots, lemon grass, peppers with mortar & pestle to add to the curry paste  rest of lemon grass, lime leaves i add whole for flavour then remove when done.  tastes good to me.. but then again i am not picky.  enjoy with a glass of gew√ºrztraminer"
325189,ehg,2009-04-02 01:42:00,2666,Real fine bunch of lakers!  Nice gourmet touch on the fish 'fry'
325208,snag,2009-04-02 02:16:00,1932,"Great fish,  Culinary master,  Protects us from terror,   You're the swiss army knife in humanoid form!   Respect!"
325255,WeedLine,2009-04-02 04:32:00,322,Nice bunch of lakers.
325369,Raf,2009-04-02 15:19:00,3495, thanks.. but I will be the 1st to admit I am a hack - google is my friend.  any other suggestions for the authentic asian flavour?  i hear water chestnuts mentioned but what the heck do you do with them?
325391,Joeytier,2009-04-02 16:21:00,3990,"Wow, you guys some into some giant lakers.  Nice work."
325397,John,2009-04-02 16:44:00,2956, A little cilantro to finish it off Raf...
325413,ehg,2009-04-02 18:09:00,2666,Nice lakerfest there again Raf!   Not sure of recipe used but lots of ginger and garlic helps the asian cuisine. Just mince it and throw it in when sauteing onions etc....  Also throwing in a tsp of cumin seeds at that time ain't bad.  Oddly crumbled feta halfway through could kick it up a notch.  Agree....  Gotta try that recipe with that GB musky meat
325424,Raf,2009-04-02 18:39:00,3495, cilantro = coriander.  i do use it but in dried powder form.  maybe i should try leaves   i'm going to experiment with galangal which is similar to ginger but not.  cumin - check  feta - now there's an idea!  i'm going to have to fish the kawarthas to give muskie meat a shot. i'm sure it would work well with pike too.
