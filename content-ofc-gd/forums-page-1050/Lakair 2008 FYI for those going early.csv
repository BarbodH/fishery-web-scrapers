I'm with Glen a muskie would be puuuuurrreee accident for me. Mind you given my luck the year I don't target or want them will be the year I hook into a 60"" one"
185959,Gerritt,2008-04-12 13:27:00,6129,  right beside the Muskie Steaks  G
186018,Beans,2008-04-12 16:47:00,3339,I believe Maureen has booked our cabin from Monday 16th to Sunday 22nd...  She won't be coming up until Wednesday 18th so it looks like Maribeth and I will have the whole camp to ourselves for two days (including the 'skeeters)...
186026,SlowPoke,2008-04-12 17:02:00,2984,Stop using the 6/0 sibiki rig!
186051,Wendel,2008-04-12 18:22:00,213,"I know it's off topic, but is there an official lakeair 2008 information thread yet?  Can't seem to find one."
186062,lew,2008-04-12 18:43:00,12767,"Wendel, the ""official"" thread will go up in about a month or so, but basically the g2g is the weekend of June 20-22 and there's usually quite a crowd of us there, with some coming the entire week before and others staying well into the 2nd week.  We have a pike derby followed by a fish fry on the Saturday and that's worth the price of admission by itself. Everyone donates a prize to the table and that way everybody also receives one, with incredible prizes & a trophy going to the biggest fish.  Last year a bunch of us got together on the Friday, caught a bunch of pike  then headed to one of the islands for about the best shore lunch I've had in many years........see my pics at the top of this post.  Lotsa fun, lotsa laffs and more fish than you can shake the proverial stick at.  If you care to join our little group, give Kevin or Leslie a call.....1 800 381 5145"
187362,Loonietoon,2008-04-15 01:56:00,1450,Just got off the phone with Leslie and set up my Camping spot & docking space.. Coming in Thursday morning June 19/08  might even show up Wednesday night late.. depending on Work
187367,irishfield,2008-04-15 02:04:00,26272,Well.. I've received no response to my Friday am email. Guess I might have to resort to ma bell...
187478,John,2008-04-15 12:09:00,2956,I had to do the same Wayne. Seems that they don't answer e-mails too quickly. I sent 3 in 5 days...........
187480,Roy,2008-04-15 12:12:00,13728,The best way to get a reply is to phone or post to Zack asking about ice conditions. Immediate response.
187483,John,2008-04-15 12:16:00,2956," Yeah, yeah......I got it after 5 days....remember we are from Southern Ontario bud."
187501,lew,2008-04-15 12:43:00,12767,"I was talking to Kevin on the phone on Saturday and got my usual spot booked.  He says there's still ice on the lake and they'd just received another 5"" of snow, but he promised to have it all shovelled out by June  We also talked about setting up another fish fry over on Tombstone on the 20th and he's all for it. Entry fee will be one pike and a BIG appetite"
187534,Marty,2008-04-15 13:57:00,873,"Hey Lew, I'm gonna put some pressure on you.  My 5 year old son may make his first Canadian trip with my dad and I.   He thinks about muskies 24/7.    I'm gonna tell him you're the expert.    I hope your up for it."
187539,lew,2008-04-15 14:10:00,12767,"Only if you take us to your secret spot on the French, Marty, you & Tony always blurred your backgrounds to keep us lurkers  in the dark.  You showed me & Adam once but it was hard to keep track at Warp 7"
187542,Marty,2008-04-15 14:14:00,873,It's a deal.   We'll be in my boat this year.   It's much slower than Tony's rocket.
187767,Rich Clemens,2008-04-15 22:19:00,3131,I can see it now ... a whole armada of boats heading out to the bays.  Count me in
185450,irishfield,2008-04-11 15:20:00,26272,Just so you know you'z/we'z be fishing Pickeral and Pike only it appears !
185454,lew,2008-04-11 15:29:00,12767,"That's exactly why I've changed my plans for this year Wayne.  I always go up the Monday before the g2g and spend the whole week, but this year I'm not going up until the Thursday and will stay till the following Wed or Thursday."
185456,irishfield,2008-04-11 15:36:00,26272,"Raf woke me up to the fact Lew ! We haven't made any plans yet as too much has been going on around here with health x2 and legal/land stuff to be able to commit.  So Friday we can fish for pike and other species for a ""Choronzey"" meal on Tombstone. Sounds good. Will have to see what Leah and I can put together to be there."
185458,lew,2008-04-11 15:42:00,12767," Wayne, the Tombstone fish fry was one of my most enjoyable days from all of last year and I think it should definetely become an annual event    "
185459,Raf,2008-04-11 15:44:00,3495,it certainly is a rude awakening Wayne.  Have fun guys.
185470,irishfield,2008-04-11 15:51:00,26272,"It is Raf.. dang leap years! Do fish really know what day of the week it is.... would it be too hard to just nail down a date like ""opens June 15th"" or something!"
185472,Raf,2008-04-11 15:56:00,3495,i hear what you are saying.. they seem to have no problem closing it on Nov 15th in the Kawarthas every year!
185473,Roy,2008-04-11 15:59:00,13728,That's why we picked that weekend.
185478,irishfield,2008-04-11 16:14:00,26272,I'm shore you did Roy !  Just glad I hadn't booked a cabin Monday to Monday like I did last year...
185482,Gerritt,2008-04-11 16:22:00,6129,"Yeah,.... Wayne good thing your not a Bass Fisherman either....  G"
185483,lew,2008-04-11 16:22:00,12767," Thanks for the reminder Wayne, I just realized I haven't booked my usual campsite yet.  Sheeesh, I may end up sleeping in my boat for a week......sure hope my tent fits in it"
185485,irishfield,2008-04-11 16:24:00,26272, I don't understand why they even have a season G.  We might be sleeping in the boat too Lew... you don't snore do ya? Might determine our dock positons! lol
185502,John,2008-04-11 16:54:00,2956,"Yup, we are going Thursday through Monday. Offer is still open Wayne....."
185581,Rich Clemens,2008-04-11 18:50:00,3131,Yeah ... I owe a big debt to Lew for letting me know about the musky opener (Thanks again bud).    We're also coming in on Thursday and staying until Wednesday of the following week.   Didn't want to go all the way up there without a few days of musky fishing.    That OFC fish fry last year on Tombstone was a great idea and hope we can do it again this year ... my wife' never had a river-side fish fry before.  HOPE WE  REMEMBER THE DANG BEER THIS YEAR
185586,Roy,2008-04-11 19:00:00,13728,And she still won't Rich. Nipissing is a lake. :-)
185606,Rich Clemens,2008-04-11 19:47:00,3131, Shhhhhhh ... it'll be our little secret.  We'll tell her after it's all over.
185673,Greencoachdog,2008-04-11 21:56:00,8163,"It doesn't matter a bit to me, I'm ticked off at the West Arm Mucksies anyway!!!  They've ignored my offerings for the past 2 years in a row and they're on my shitlist. Pike and Wall-ice are absolutely fine with me, at least they'll cooperate a little bit every once in a while!!!  ... and if a sucidal Mucksie is stupid enough to jump on my Pike or Wall-ice bait, he'll get a quick pic and release... in season or out. He may even tote a 5 second Dawg-Cussin' to take back to all his friends and relatives too.   That shore lunch was the best last year Lew!!!   It was my first one ever and would be disappointing not to do it again!!!"
185676,Gerritt,2008-04-11 22:08:00,6129,  Be sure to bring a sweater... I dont want to hear that that all you caught was a cold..  Ohhhh...   Tiller!  G
185774,Joey,2008-04-12 01:35:00,9122,"Awwwwww man, we always book the week after so all you rif raf are gone (no offence Raf   )  We're already booked so looks like its gonna be a fun week this year.  Maybe a little musky tourny is in order  Oh, nevermind, Lew will be there, we're doomed  Joey"
185921,Rich Clemens,2008-04-12 11:07:00,3131," True .... But maybe if the rest of us pull our resources together, combined, we could win it.       I'm really looking forward to the opener and getting back out there.  I need to get better at making the ""followers"" into biters."
185949,aplumma,2008-04-12 13:16:00,6896,If Lew cant find the keys to his boat he cant win the tourneyment Joey...... Now I not suggesting that you give him a big hug and slip his keys out of his pocket or something.....   Art
185953,lew,2008-04-12 13:24:00,12767,"Hey Art, a hug from Joey would be worth giving up my boat"
185955,Roy,2008-04-12 13:24:00,13728,"Nah, she wouldn't do that, Art. Paul might though."
185956,Dano,2008-04-12 13:26:00,719," LOL, I wonder if there will be some at the fish fry this year....  Fern and I will be jigging squid, cod or lobster fishing that week....oh well."
185957,Gerritt,2008-04-12 13:26:00,6129,"  He's so pretty, oh so pretty, oh so pretty and witty and gay......  G"
