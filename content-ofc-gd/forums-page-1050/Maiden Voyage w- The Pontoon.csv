186655,fishindevil,2008-04-13 22:34:00,6254,Great looking pontoon boat dude !!!!!...nice catch as well
186669,solopaddler,2008-04-13 23:04:00,8605,"Nice setup bud, love it! (Looks like a mint little spot you were fishing too)"
186687,CLofchik,2008-04-13 23:28:00,854,"FYI -- As soon as you put a motor on anything in Ontario you need your Operators Card, just in case anybody wasn't aware of that.  I know a guy who takes his 'tooner out chasing rainbows and salmon out in Lake O, they're alot more stable than you'd think at first glance. He has a little Eagle on his, to hold the transducer he bolted PVC plumbing pipe to the frame and left one joint unglued.  Very handy to swivel up & down launching or clearing crap hung up on it."
186879,ccmtcanada,2008-04-14 11:27:00,7971,Wow!  That final mods look awesome!  Great to see it all come together like that.  That is some serious fishing machine you got there....get a new deep cycle marine battery and you're all set for a full day out there.
186883,mepps,2008-04-14 11:35:00,1301,"Nice setup, I love it!"
186950,fishnsled,2008-04-14 14:29:00,3520,Great report UF!!  Awesome to see your rig on the water and some fish as well!
186990,Reef Runner,2008-04-14 15:52:00,981,"Sweet ride and great report.  Thanks for posting UF,  lookin' forward to some more 'toon trials.  reefrunner"
187891,FinS,2008-04-16 01:23:00,463,nice setup and congrats on the nice gills  i just bought one today at canadian tire for 349 its the backpacker model weighs 42lbs took me 2 hours to set it up lol  i plan to try it out in the morning sometime to see how i like it  before you did the mods was it good and stable
188166,jdmls,2008-04-16 17:12:00,575,LOL thats awesome......i wonder how she would boogy with a 9.9HP on the back of that plywood !!!!
188190,The Urban Fisherman,2008-04-16 18:07:00,2050," Very stable - I used to stand on the seat when fishing before I did the mods.  If you're going to be back-packing stick with the one you have obviously, but if you're going to just set it up by the car and walk down to the water i'd return the one you have and get one like mine.  It's just more solid and probably more comfortable.  Let me know how the first trip on the water goes!  Good Fishin' UF"
186056,The Urban Fisherman,2008-04-12 18:32:00,2050,"My fiance bought me an electric motor for the modified pontoon boat as a birthday gift, so  this morning I decided to head out after panfish.  My target fish were big bluegill with hopes of stumbling upon some crappie.  Despite last nights insane lightning storm it still turned out to be a decent morning.    The boat ran smooth and sturdy - better than I'd hoped.  Man it feels good to fish with a little comfort again.   First stop was my bluegill spots, really sort of the same spots you'd look for crappie in the spring, back bays and sunken tree's.  It was tough to find my main sunken tree's as the water was murky and much higher than what I'm used to.  The fish were also scattered, and deep.  You'd get 1 maybe 2 fish per tree.  Anyways, same old bait, pink trout worm under a float - the bluegill love them.  I need to find a better way to take pictures on the boat though...   Managed 5 keepers, with a 10.5 incher being the biggest of the day.  Things were just heating up when my battery died. (borrowed it, it's an older deep cycle)     Somewhere in the middle I got this suprise OOS Stocker Rainbow.  Went back unharmed.   All in all not a bad 2.5 hours on the water and I'm more than happy with the new pontoon boat. Can't wait to hit the lake again next weekend!   Cheers, UF"
186058,canadian_copper,2008-04-12 18:34:00,925,NICELY DONE BRO!!! I GOTTA GET ME ONE OF THOSE!!!
186059,The Urban Fisherman,2008-04-12 18:37:00,2050,Thanks CC!  They're only about $250.00 @ BPS now!  I made some serious mods though!  Cheers dude!
186068,forrest,2008-04-12 18:59:00,1032,Urban Fisherman:  BPS website has them at $330 right now. Is the price different in the store or am I looking at the wrong one?  http://www.basspro.com/webapp/wcs/stores/s...t=SearchResults  forrest
186075,The Urban Fisherman,2008-04-12 19:14:00,2050,"Hey Forest I saw them at BPS in vaughn for around that price...it was a few weeks ago though..might have been a sale for the BPS Classic.  Give them a call!  Cheers, UF"
186077,misfish,2008-04-12 19:22:00,29133,   Can I shoot ducks and geese from one of them???????????????
186082,Snypa,2008-04-12 19:37:00,25,"Nice report, early season bluegill is the way to go !!  And that definetly is a sweet rig you got there UrbanFishermen"
186111,setomonkey,2008-04-12 20:52:00,872,"I remember your post when you customized your ride, very sweet to get out on it and do some early season openwater fishing...  Mike"

186381,Ramble,2008-04-13 04:36:00,713,I'm very impressed that the set up works well after the modifications. The little vessle would be excellent in small lake territory. Congrats in a successful 1st voyage.  -R-
186390,Master of Bait,2008-04-13 05:25:00,196,Love that rig.  Easy for a one-man trip.  Nice fish too!
186394,lookinforwalleye,2008-04-13 05:50:00,4399,  Sure you could but if they shoot back you maybe in trouble!
186417,b2kptbo,2008-04-13 10:56:00,1505,"Looks like fun, cool..."
186422,Tarzan's Jane,2008-04-13 11:14:00,1183,Go Team 11...
186428,lew,2008-04-13 11:37:00,12767,"You've done a great job of customizing the pontoon Urban, it's always good to see a plan come together and now your finally getting some fish in it too.  Great stuff"
186432,Greencoachdog,2008-04-13 12:02:00,8163,"Excellent report and pics!!!  I can tell how cold the water still is there by the color of the first 'Gill, be careful out there... a swim in that stuff wouldn't be pleasant I don't think.  A 10.5"" 'Gill is a big ol bull!!!... and that meat is oh so SWEET!!!  You've done a great job on the 'toon!!!... and should catch some real nice fish from her this season!!!  Thanks for takin' the time to post!"
186436,oldphart,2008-04-13 12:29:00,665,"~~~Great post Team mate, you might consider getting a Tripod mounted on the bow for the camera, to get those action shots"
186453,HTHM,2008-04-13 13:10:00,4082,"How stable is it with the high seat on it, and how about the wind catching you? It is a nice looking rig!"
186457,Rich,2008-04-13 13:18:00,3927,"Awesome man, you weren't kidding about pimpin' that 'tooner. Sweet mods. We'll have to race ya in the bass hound sometime out there"
186495,outdoorguy61,2008-04-13 14:50:00,220,"Hi misfish I am hoping you can shed some light on the stability of how you have setup your craft. I see a tremendous amount of them where I work in western Canada, but have not seen anything with a mounted seat that high. It looked far more handy. I am hoping you se this and can reply. Thank-you.  outdoorguy61"
186511,The Urban Fisherman,2008-04-13 15:20:00,2050,"Fish Finder dude - i've got a humminbird on its way! haha   Thanks GCD - The water was is like ice, there's still some snow on the banks here and there.  But we had a HUGE rain storm the night before and the was was really stained which might also affect the color of the fish.   to bad the tourny hasn't started yet or I'd have let some of the bigger gills go and used them for the tourny - i'm getting a measuring sticker for one of hte pontoons with the OFC logo and our team logo.   Extremely stable - see last coment...It's a light rig so the wind pushes you around pretty easily, nothing a small anchor or drift sock can't take care of though....   VERY STABLE!  you can stand up no problem and move around, setting the hook isn't an issue at all, but keep in mind i'm a smaller dude - 155lbs.  Trolling to my spot with the electric worked out great to...I'd stay away from any white water though, slower current would be ok i'm sure, but I'm only using it for small lakes, ponds and long points inner bay when it's calm."
186514,The Urban Fisherman,2008-04-13 15:35:00,2050," Supposed to warm up all week and be nice and hot next weekend - hopefully the Gill's and Crappie will school up and move shallow.  Should make for an awesome outing!  I'm sure you and Sleded will be chasing cats again but if not I'll be on the water, same spot same time!  Cheers dude"
