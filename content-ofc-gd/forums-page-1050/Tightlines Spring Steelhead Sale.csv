188328,forrest,2008-04-16 22:52:00,1032,"Tightline is a great shop.  It beats Lebarons for selection and should make Gagnon's feel ashamed with their lot.  Prices are so so, not as good as BPS.  Anyone have details on sale prices?  When are they going to get a website going?  forrest Anyone from Gagnon's listening?"
188350,lew,2008-04-16 23:30:00,12767," You've got that right, forrest !!  John runs a quality shop with an excellent inventory and his customer service is 2nd to none.  I've been dealing with him for a long time now and have never had a single issue with anything, infact  I've bought 2 rods & a reel from him in the last month alone.  If anyones looking for an excellent ""Mom & Pop"" type of shop, go have a look.  And BTW, the ""Mom & Pop"" is only an expression cause John is young enuff to be my son"
188351,ccmtcanada,2008-04-16 23:30:00,7971,"Bly went there today...stocked up on jigs, leader material, shot, floats....  I think we'll be eating Kraft Dinner for the rest of the week now...."
