188466,Greencoachdog,2008-04-17 01:48:00,8163,  The other Mucksies are watchin and shivverin' in their boots glad it wasn't them Dan! 
188544,Jigger,2008-04-17 03:33:00,1237,"  Thanks for that, wallacio. Thats encouraging to know. I was wrong and I'll admit it."
188546,Musky or Specks,2008-04-17 03:43:00,2710,Dont worry Jigger your not alone it takes a big man to admit they are wrong. I dont know you from squat but my opinion(which in my egocentric world is a thing of high value) just went up a bunch of notches. Education is the key to all fisheries the more we clear up misconceptions the better.
188551,Guest Fishing For Life,2008-04-17 04:03:00,0,"Hi all,  I think my own experience is probably one of the most truthful opinions  i just started steelheading last Nov and i was afraid of terrible things I have heard about steelheaders. too name a few, have heard people cutting other people's lines b/c of over-drifting, b/c of out-of-sync castings with others, b/c some think they OWN the river/spot  have I seen those terrible behaviors on rivers? the answer is YES, but it is like less than 1% of the whole steelheaders  99% of steelheaders are nice, down-to-earth and very friendly when you treat them with respect by saying hello, or even asking for advises! some even let me have the better spots they were fishing at so that I get to have some fish! not to mention after seeing each other couple times we even make arrangements to fish together!  having learnt so much from those nice steelheaders, I also teach other new steelheaders who obvisouly dont know what they are doing and help them to get fish. man oh man, seeing them having fish on is way more satisfying than having my lines tight!  Special thanks to Mike, Jim, Rob, Robin, Josh and other steelheaders I have met so far and look forward to meeting you on the river!"

188599,wallacio,2008-04-17 12:13:00,475,"  No worries Jigger...I merely pointed this fact out in order to educate with conservation in mind.   Unfortunately to this day, it's still a very common misconception that our Ontario Steelhead are the result of a ""put and take"" fishery when in fact most of our rivers now depend on natural reproduction (entirely or in part), which of course requires an adequate number or fish to be present each year to spawn.    Some systems only see a year class of a precious few individuals (a few 100 or 1000) and when you pair that with extremely high harvest rates, it's easy to understand why the repeated killing of wild fish doesn't sit well with some of us (even when it's done within the allowable limits).  Personally, I'd like to see steelhead considered a ""sport fish"" and be managed as such, similar to the way Musky are.   It's time to move away from the attitude that they are merely fish for the pan (not that I'm against the harvest of fish from sustainable populations).   Ironically, this is the case in New York which relies almost exclusively on stocking programs.   There is a one fish limit for Steelhead and it's rare to see even a few anglers harvesting their allowance of one fish."
188616,steverowbotham,2008-04-17 12:54:00,1800,The steelhead fishery is self sustaining.  Chinooks are definitely put and take.
188633,ehg,2008-04-17 13:31:00,2666,"Rainbows/salmon were stocked originally in Great Lakes as 'put and take' fishery. Now some steelhead reproduce successfully, thats alright. They are a non- indegenous species (almost invasive reducing brook trout habitat).  No doubt most pinners/steelheaders tend to get a bit over-zealous, but that's another story.  ehg"
188643,Headhunter,2008-04-17 13:49:00,5703,"Pick your days, hop in yer boat and cruise the lake, just outside of the creek... you will have all the luck you want, no one on top of you and the fashion police will be on shore. Problem solved! HH"
188660,fish_finder,2008-04-17 15:04:00,370,I'm not too worried at all.  I'll let the steelhead bums catch all the chrome     I'll be after brookies and browns.  Maybe on the monday I'll get out for some steel once the mayhem has settled a little!!!
188694,Musky or Specks,2008-04-17 16:44:00,2710,Oh I think youd be suprized by the amount of naturally reproducing chinooks as well. I know tribs of the Notty were chinook Young of the Year outnumber Rainbow YOY 3/2.
188368,ccmtcanada,2008-04-16 23:49:00,7971,"Crowds are why most of our outings are at night....some don't mind crowds....some hate them....to each their own.  I fish to relax....and I'd rather catch less fish and be out there in seclusion and fish during non prime times, then have to worry about other's around me."
188369,danc,2008-04-16 23:52:00,4677, Best words that I've quoted on here ever.
188370,kemper,2008-04-16 23:53:00,2232,I MUCH prefer winter steelheading over late spring steelheading. I bet if we were to poll the steelheaders anyone that is halfway serious about it would much rather fish with the entire river to themselves in late winter/very early spring when the big boys are in and hungry. There is nothing that beats spending  a whole day on the river catching double digits in steel without seeing another soul.
188371,irishfield,2008-04-16 23:55:00,26272, You just do that so you can have your wife in the dark with no kids around....
188372,ccmtcanada,2008-04-16 23:57:00,7971, So it accomplishes TWO things then Wayne....LOL
188374,ccmtcanada,2008-04-17 00:01:00,7971," I don't consider myself a steelheader....I consider myself an angler who happens to target steelhead when nothing else is open for me to target.  But I agree with you Kemper...give me frozen guides, avoiding slush coming down the stream and seclusion to late spring...even if I don't catch huge numbers.  Anyhow, I have a boat now....so I'm looking forward to the new waters I can explore this summer."
188376,Musky or Specks,2008-04-17 00:02:00,2710,Just not (Ihope) at the same time.
188377,Gerritt,2008-04-17 00:04:00,6129,  why not... that would be the ultimate thrill would it not??  a piece of..... while fighting a fish..... Heaven!!!   you have just given me an idea.... now to find a women willing to cooperate.. LOL   G
188378,kemper,2008-04-17 00:06:00,2232,"I never thought I would say this but  BRING BACK MARCH!!!!!  Actually I noticed last year that I nailed fish all winter long untill about the first weekend in april then I did not catch a damn thing untill opener (13 for 20 before 8 am) and then NOTHING after that.  I hate low, clear water.   a trib searching i will go..."
188379,Musky or Specks,2008-04-17 00:08:00,2710,Um I hate to think what would happen when at the critical moment you got a hit. You might be sleeping on the couch for the rest of your life.
188380,Gerritt,2008-04-17 00:10:00,6129,  google earth is your friend!! use it to find the secret spot LOL  Good luck Kemper! keep us in the know  G
188382,solopaddler,2008-04-17 00:10:00,8605, Now if you could get her to hold up a small portable tv with a playoff game on at the same time you were enjoying the other 2 pastimes...now THAT would be the ultimate!
188383,Gerritt,2008-04-17 00:10:00,6129,  it would be no different then now MS.. she saw my purchases... lol  G
188384,kemper,2008-04-17 00:12:00,2232,See what happens when you get a bunch of steelheaders in one thread.  It either turns into a brawl...a match of who is better...whos pin is better and what cast is better...or who tells the best sex jokes.  geez   what can I say...steelheaders do have the longest rods.  lock it up. lol
188386,Gerritt,2008-04-17 00:14:00,6129,  I would vote her Mrs. or Miss. Canada!!!!!!!!!!  G
188387,Musky or Specks,2008-04-17 00:16:00,2710,Somewhere in there you have to fit a cup holder....Hold on are we talking about a woman or an inflatable pontoon??? Im confused... This is why I see a therapist.
188390,Gerritt,2008-04-17 00:19:00,6129,"Kemper... I am not a steelheader much like Cliff, I fish to fish... and to relax...  Given the recent Steelhead threads gone bad on the board I think a bunch of the guys are just letting off some much needed steam...  Kemper, if your a steelheader your one of the good guys here.. I have yet to see you bash another angler for the 1000000 things they seem to do it for..  I look forward to your report on your adventures!  G"
188392,solopaddler,2008-04-17 00:22:00,8605," I already thought about the cupholder, but where would she put it? Naw, that's pushing it I think. What you need is one of those redneck caps with the drink holders on each side and a hose snaking into your mouth....  (I've got every angle covered!  )"
188393,kemper,2008-04-17 00:22:00,2232,"I was just kiddin Gerrit..sarcasm is tough to read on the net!  I dont feel the need to bash other guys because I can work my pin better....yada yada  Steelheading is the ultimate stress relief for me, and also the ultimate rush. I have no problem introducing other anglers to the sport and you can garantee anyone I help out is going to have the same attitude about it as me, or I wont be helping!"
188400,Gerritt,2008-04-17 00:26:00,6129,  Kemper.... I vote this for the most sensible thing a steelheader has ever posted...  good on you man..  it is steelheaders such as yourself and others on the board that make this time of year bearable...  I dont hate the haters.. I hate the game... LOL  G
188403,kemper,2008-04-17 00:30:00,2232,"I hate the game too Gerritt, that is why I fish by myself in the winter!  None of this shoulder to shoulder crap for me!   Trust me there is many guys I see on the river all the time that I would love to give a swift kick into the current. I once told a guy to take a long walk off a short pier after he walked up and drifted RIGHT beside the fish I was fighting. He didn't seem to understand what I meant..."
188405,Jigger,2008-04-17 00:32:00,1237,"I'd like to see the numbers in 5-10 yrs if they stopped stocking steelhead in the streams. If you think it isn't put and take you're a little deluded. I commend the folks at Metro E.Anglers, and others that put as much into it as they do. Without them, that fishery would have and would collapse if left to its own devices."
188408,The Urban Fisherman,2008-04-17 00:37:00,2050,"well I can fish Lower Big Creek year around, but there's a small stream, like 1km away from my doorstep that holds steelhead and I can't touch it until opener.... Hooked a few last december before it closed and i'm dying to try it again come opener.  As some others said, I'll probably fish that weekend and maybe once or twice more depending on how the first outings go...."
188409,Musky or Specks,2008-04-17 00:38:00,2710,I cant speak for Ontario tribs but ive seen the numbers for fishways from most of the streams in Ontario andthe majority of the fissh are unclipped and assumed to be the product of natural reproduction. Ive done electrofishing on creeks that are no more than drainage ditches and have found naturally reproduced smolts in them. Im not deluded Im informed. Instead of beiing a negative nelly get out there and join a club and do your part to make the fishing better.
188450,wallacio,2008-04-17 01:28:00,475,"  Jigger,  Please check your facts....the MEA primarily stocks the Rouge with Steelhead and none of the other Eastern tribs receive any plantings of Steelhead.   See link below...in fact, look at the source for the Rouge plantings (WILD fish from Duffins Creek).   These creeks, as with almost every other steelhead river in the province rely on natural reproduction...which explains why we passionate steelheaders tend to get a bit over-zealous when it comes to their conservation.  http://www.glfc.org/lakecom/loc/mgmt_unit/06_app_C.pdf"
188287,kemper,2008-04-16 21:56:00,2232,"No rain in the next week...water levels are LOW as it is. I checked the place I usually hit for opener and it was low with only a couple trout hanging out.  What do you guys think, a waste of an opener or not?  I know if it does't rain soon ill be finding bigger water for the opener...or fishing browns from the peir..."
188288,Gerritt,2008-04-16 21:57:00,6129,calling for rain friday and sunday here in hamilton
188296,ccmtcanada,2008-04-16 22:05:00,7971,Maybe have to fish lower sections for dropbacks?  A ton of fish had to have run somewhere.....did the spawn happen early?  I'm not even sure if we are going out for the opener this year....
188300,kemper,2008-04-16 22:08:00,2232,"Checked the lower today too cliff..I have NO idea where all the fish went. Must be all the way up the top end around the ladder?  I dont know, im going to do some hunting later this week, but i think im going to end up driving a long way to find em this year"
188306,addict,2008-04-16 22:22:00,475,opener always sucks.river is to small up north loaded with snags and a million yahoos.go crappie fishin instead.
188309,Jigger,2008-04-16 22:29:00,1237,"Is it me, or did the regs change for trout opener? I could swear it was always 3rd Sat. in April, now they've moved it to 4th week? For a put-and-take fishery, it seems kind of silly to move this date. If it indeed got moved, that is."
188312,Musky or Specks,2008-04-16 22:34:00,2710,
188319,gone_fishin,2008-04-16 22:45:00,481,Duffin's is still really high and still very stained. didn't see any trout though... just lots of suckers.
188320,wallacio,2008-04-16 22:45:00,475," Up until this year, Trout opener was the last Saturday in April however going forward (ie 2008) it is the fourth Saturday (which was usually the last, but not every year).  Regarding the notion of  ""Put and Take"" trout fishery in Ontario, as MuskyorSpecks states most Trout populations are self-sustaining including virtually every Steelhead river in the province.    Some rivers receive limited numbers of stocked Steelhead however these are usually just a (minor) supplement to an existing, self-sustaining population."
188322,canadian_copper,2008-04-16 22:47:00,925,I'LL SEND U A PM
188330,danc,2008-04-16 22:58:00,4677,"Curious about one thing here guys. I see Steelhead reports here pretty much daily from southern Ontario, and then I see posts about ""the opener"". Which takes place in a couple of weeks from what I gather. So why do I see all these Steelhead reports if the ""opener"" is still a couple of weeks away?"
188333,canadian_copper,2008-04-16 23:08:00,925,ITS YR ROUND FROM THE CN TRACK DOWN TO THE LAKE DAN!!! THEY'RE SAFE TILL OPENER ONCE THEY GET TO THE TRACKS!!
188334,solopaddler,2008-04-16 23:08:00,8605, Most of our trib's have a year round open season in their lower stretches. Personally I just don't see the attraction of steelhead fishing on the inland trout opener when the best fishing is long past.
188335,Musky or Specks,2008-04-16 23:08:00,2710,
188337,jdmls,2008-04-16 23:09:00,575," There are sections of rivers,mostly lower sections, that are open all year...the opener makes the whole river game in most places...."
188342,ccmtcanada,2008-04-16 23:17:00,7971,"I know what some are saying here.  Last year was our first year trout fishing and we were all pumped about the ""opener"".  While we had a good time, it was also pretty much our trout closer as well....LOL.  This year, we are not sure if we will go out....we may go once after the opener, but as Solopaddler said, the attraction for us isn't as great.  The hard thing is that not much else is biting locally....maybe go bottom fish for bullhead.....LOL."
188343,danc,2008-04-16 23:17:00,4677,"LOL... Thanks guys. I knew that there was a simple answer somewhere. Living in the north, there's no restrictions period. Steelhead are open everywhere year round. Things are just getting started here recently. Most rivers are still pretty much iced up, but  thawing as I type. If I get any Steelhead this year, it will be in June. And they will most likely be pre spawn."
188344,jdmls,2008-04-16 23:19:00,575," c,mon man.....pretty much every trib on the east side is going to be full for opener....pick one and walk...or you can be like the majority and just fish the ganny....even with the 1000 people that are going to be present you will still get into double digits if you know what your doing...from what i have seen I will give you that...  I dunno about you guys but I enjoy fishing the opener...I look at it as having an audience, LOL....besides 90% of the guys out on the opener have no clue what they are doing and just watch in aww as you pluck one after another out of the hole they have been fishing in all morning....I know you experienced float fishersman can relate !!!!"

188357,Gerritt,2008-04-16 23:35:00,6129,I prefer this tune....   And here I go again on my own... going down the only road I've ever known... Like a drifter I was born be to alone.....   WhiteSnake... great back when I was a kidlet..  G
188362,lew,2008-04-16 23:42:00,12767," I've never had much interest in steelheading or even river fishing in general, and when I see some of those pics of the guys standing shoulder to shoulder it just blows my mind.  Even reading some of the threads around here where guys are talking about hooking a fish and then tangling lines with the guy beside him while they fight it makes me wonder how anyone could really get into it.  I feel like I'm being crowded with one other person in the boat with me in the middle of a lake"
188364,danc,2008-04-16 23:45:00,4677, But why would you even want to catch a fish if you don't have an audience Lew??? Seems like a waste of time to me.   :whistling:
188366,Musky or Specks,2008-04-16 23:48:00,2710,"I use to be huge into steelheading and lots of my buddies still are. My thousands of dollars worth of equipment just sits in the closet. Break it out once in while for a fall Lake Superior trip. Otherwise Id rather be Musky fishing or suprise, speck fishing."
