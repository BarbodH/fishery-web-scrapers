187841,danc,2008-04-16 00:30:00,4677, Obviously whats an arm and a leg to a pinner isn't an arm and a leg to everyone else.
187867,Spiel,2008-04-16 00:53:00,9065,"  ....Really Sonny? Well I did and I do and so do the experts at Orvis.   ""Ferrules that stick constantly should be cleaned and lubricated. Clean both the male and female sections with soap and water, using a Q-tip to get inside the female ferrule. Polish the surface of the male ferrule with a soft cloth. After both sections are completely dry, check the fit. If it's still tight, they'll need lubrication, but never use grease or oil and never rub a ferrule alongside your nose or ear. Greasy substances cause suction in the ferrule and also attract dirt particles. Fiberglass, boron/graphite, and graphite self-ferrules should be lubricated with paraffin, metal ferrules with dry soap.""  As for nose oil, yea my Dad recommended it and I still do for metal ferrules, always worked well for me."
187872,holdfast,2008-04-16 00:58:00,1813,"The suspense is killing me, is it apart and how"
187875,highdrifter,2008-04-16 01:02:00,2534," I'd apply that rule to english ferrules, made with german nickel silver... not the regular kind..  but then again, what do I know?! heheeh"
187977,Maverick,2008-04-16 03:18:00,371,Taking bets... 5:1 he gets it apart!  Anyone??  Good luck!
188347,sonny,2008-04-16 23:23:00,511,"thanks spiel,,,didn't realise the difference between fiber and graphite,,,,learn something new everyday!"
188349,ccmtcanada,2008-04-16 23:27:00,7971,So...did he get his rod apart?  Maybe something awful happened to him in the attempt?  Stay tuned....find out if he was successful....  Story at 11?
188363,maybe,2008-04-16 23:44:00,307,"I believe he said he just pulled on it harder and it came apart.  Was too shocked by the language to really soak in the details.  Next time I looked at the thread, the post was gone."
188411,danbouck,2008-04-17 00:39:00,4380,  I believe it was apart after 5 F-bombs!
188418,Guest Fishing For Life,2008-04-17 00:54:00,0,"Hi all,  just want to say ""thank you"" to your support again and I want to officially again announce that they were separated  Thanks, really appreciated it."
188490,goteeboy,2008-04-17 02:06:00,175,Congrats!  so which method got it apart? or was it a combination of methods?  helpful minds want to know.
188492,danbouck,2008-04-17 02:09:00,4380, If I remember the deleted post correctly he just pulled harder!
188662,Garry2Rs,2008-04-17 15:08:00,1425,"My method is similar to the knee one all ready mentioned... Put the rod behind your butt, grasp either side of the stuck ferrell and squat so that your hands are pushed out by your butt cheeks.  It sounds funny but it always worked for me, back in the days of metal ferrell's"
188681,ssminnow,2008-04-17 16:04:00,48,I get my wife to stand at the end of the dock and hold firmly while I hold the other end.  Then I tell her to pull.  This way if she falls backwards the rod has a soft landing.
186928,Guest Fishing For Life,2008-04-14 13:31:00,0,"Hi all,  someone at the river suggested me to oil/lurb connecting sections of my 3-piece 13'6 Shedfield rod to keep it in good condition .. (he did not explain why ..)  Anyhow, i oiled them and put them together .. and HECK! I could not take them off now! I suspect it is caused by negative pressure due to the oil sealing the sections ...  please help!"
186933,blaque,2008-04-14 13:39:00,2419,Sounds like suction at work to me also. Although i wouldnt have thought it would be so great that you cant get the rod sections apart. Strange
186934,verno,2008-04-14 13:39:00,178,"I know this sounds a bit silly but I've had success with stuck 2 piece rods by doing this. Stand up and put the rod behind your knees.  With the rod behind your knees, grasp the rod with your hand, one hand on either side of the place you want to separate.  Keep your wrists close too your knees.  Rather than pulling with your hands, push out on your wrists with your knees.  The idea is that by pushing on your wrists with your knees it keeps the force in a straight line, rather than the twisting that ends up happening by just pulling with your hands."
186935,blaque,2008-04-14 13:41:00,2419,was this a thin oil or a thick grease that you applied
186943,TOM C,2008-04-14 14:11:00,76,"Was it in a clear tube and have the word crazy in its name  Try applying some heat to it, this will liquify the grease and should release it, just be careful not to get it to hot. Even a rag dipped it boiling water should heat it up enough, or pour the boiling water right over it   AND DONT EVER OIL YOUR ROD JOINTS AGAIN"
186945,kickingfrog,2008-04-14 14:13:00,8333," That's a prank you only pull once on a fishing buddy. And I still say that it was funny, no matter what he says."
186981,Guest Fishing For Life,2008-04-14 15:25:00,0,"Hey guys,  this is not funny at all ... it costed me both legs and arms to purchase that rod ...  it was a thin oil/lub not grease ...  what to do?"
186986,Ramble,2008-04-14 15:43:00,713,"i'd let it sit out in the sun for a bit 1st off. If it is a vaccume thing, then the seal is air tight. Warming the rod should warm the air trapped inside, creating less pressure. At the same time the heat should make the oil thinner. After you have let it sit out for a while grab either side of a joint and twist and pull a little...with more twsiting then pulling see if she comes loose.  If that doesn't work we'll have to come up with something else. Just let the rod lay in teh sun on teh patios or something.....as long as it wont get stepped on.  -R-"
186991,shane,2008-04-14 15:52:00,652,"I had a rod stick together once. It wasn't caused by oil though, it was just stuck.  I applied really hot water with a rag to just the bottom (female) half of the joint, thinking that it would expand quicker than the male end,...and it worked!  Took a few minutes to heat up but I could feel it loosening up as I was twisting on the top piece and then it just slid right out.  But....this wasn't a real expensive high end rod so I would be really careful in your situation and I don't want to be responsible for any damages, so my advice is do not listen to me. (my legal disclaimer  )"
186999,maybe,2008-04-14 15:59:00,307,"I'd go with Tom C's ""pour hot water on the joint"" as a first shot...though maybe not quite boiling.  (No concrete reason, I'm just the extremely cautious type, and I'm not sure how happy rods are with that high heat.)  Heating the outside part of the stuck joint will make it larger, which should loosen things up.  Try to keep the water on the handle side of the joint, you don't want to expand the inside/tip section of the joint.  Anything I can't take the lid off of (glass jars, plastic pop bottles, whatever) routinely gets held under the hot tap for 10-15 seconds.  Opens right up after that.  You just have to remember to cool the lid off before you put it back on the container, or you'll definitely need the hot water again next time.  This trick also works when you set one glass tumbler inside another and they get stuck.  Turn the water on the bottom glass, and when it expands the top one will come right out.  Good luck!!  Next question for the more knowledgeable guys...what's a safe solvent to remove the oil with, once he gets the sections apart?"
187000,TOM C,2008-04-14 15:59:00,76,"heat it, he should clean it with rubbing alcohol as this will completly dry and wont leave a residue"
187009,Ron,2008-04-14 16:13:00,1683,"  Verno has got your answer. This was always the case with the metal furrle on the older rods, especially the Algonquin fly rods."
187035,wallyboss,2008-04-14 16:47:00,1095,I would use just regular dish soap to take the oil off the rod after you pulled it apart.  then you can use a wax stick so that this doesn't happen again.  But I would not put oil on a rod I would be scared of chemical reaction with the fiberglass or whatever is used to seal the rod.
187049,Spiel,2008-04-14 17:07:00,9065,....Warming it should definitely work. Once apart clean thoroughly (ie: methyl-hydrate) then lubricate with paraffin wax and to remedy sloppy ferrules a thin coat of bee's wax.
187130,misfish,2008-04-14 19:56:00,29133,"Yep you got a suction problem. Spiel hit it right on. Bee,s wax. Good call bud."
187160,John,2008-04-14 20:37:00,2956,"Pretty much 100% of my fishing many years ago in the UK was done with long (12' +) glass rods with brass ferrules. Never ever, ever use oil to lubricate ferrules. I used to carry a piece of white candle around with me that did the job real well. Don't put your rod down on the shore disassembled you are just going to get dirt and grit in the ferrule."
187440,Nanook,2008-04-15 04:01:00,565," I also fished in the UK, using a 12' - 3 piece. An old Codger told me to use the sweat on the side of your nose to lubricate the ferrules. I never did get any stuck ferrules."
187562,John,2008-04-15 14:59:00,2956, Must have been the same codger that told that to me too......it does work.........
187571,goteeboy,2008-04-15 15:20:00,175,"This has always worked for me.  You need four hands (two should belong to someone else)  At the joint, grab rod, one hand on each piece. Your buddy does the same thing facing you, staggering his hand w/ yours. count to three, pull, and it should come right off.  Does that make sense?  I hope it does. good luck"
187701,brickNblock,2008-04-15 19:54:00,598,"Well.........you'll not like this but, The last 2 pce rod i ever owned was a Shimano..(So are all my new 1pce) and I ended up taking it back to where i bought it from..(Gagnon's..in Oshawa) They also gave it there best in the shop with no good result....... Because of the maker and the greatness of the Gagnon respect for their customers. They simply gave me another...........NoCharge  TYVM Good luck Bud!"
187789,danc,2008-04-15 23:14:00,4677,"I still use the old ""oil from the side of your nose"" trick. Just twist the male end of the ferrule along the side of your nose, and you have natures perfect ferrule lubricant. I read this some thirty years ago and have been using it since."
187790,Gerritt,2008-04-15 23:15:00,6129,   but that oil is stinky....  G
187792,danc,2008-04-15 23:17:00,4677, LOL... Good thing it isn't stored next to your nose Gerritt...
187793,OldPinner,2008-04-15 23:19:00,9,  Arm and a leg for an okuma? stick to bass fishing bud.
187820,sonny,2008-04-15 23:50:00,511,"this will work.....pack the joints of the rod in ice to quickly cool it,,,,,then remove,,never use oil or grease ,,,i wouldn't even suggest wax,,,,what i would recommend is a dry lubricant like grafite spray"
