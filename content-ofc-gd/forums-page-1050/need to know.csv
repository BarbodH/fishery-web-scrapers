This places the two batteries in parallel with each other and will give you 12 volts output, but with double the battery life. Connect your motor to junk. on one battery, and Neg.  terminal on the same battery. In my opinion, I prefer Minn Kota, but they are both very good.  Strange, the wordsmiths have changed my post! ""Junk"" has replaced the abreviated ""Positive"", so replace ""junk"" with ""+""."

LOL  What he said ! + to +, - to - ... unless of course you just buy a 24v unit since you appear to be buying one anyhow.  As to which is better.. that's another GM /Ford / Chrysler arguement !  I love my Motorquide wireless."
