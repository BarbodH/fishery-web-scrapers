The Sound looks like a dang Christmas tree farm. Dozens of trees and the marking sticks as far as the eye can see... soon to be hit by those wanting to get out for ice out Lakers like me.  It's not like the ice went out quick or anything... I guess like everything these days, easier to make a mess than to clean it up.  My rant for the day !"

It's a local guy, who I won't say his name on here, who has been doing that for the past 20 years to help snowmobilers throughout the winter season. They'll be fine shortly, when the ice melts. PM me if you want."

I know they make good structure.. but they don't sink right away.. the F in law has pulled three out that floated up on his shore this week.  There's also an ice hut out there right beside where the Coast Guard breaker came in. Enough reason for me to email Bruce Ward/MNR and cc'd to the Georgian Bay Snow Riders as to the tree and marker ""ownership""."
