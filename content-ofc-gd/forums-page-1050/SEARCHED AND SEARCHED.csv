187829,kingofthesteelhead,2008-04-16 00:10:00,140,You guys have to broaden out your fishing. Lake Simcoe is just starting to heat up for perch and crappie andthe Kawarthas will follow after the 26th of April. YOU CAN EVEN USE YOUR LONG RODS AND FLOATS. For those who have kids get them out and let them enjoy this fine fishing. I have a 13 year old daughter and a wife who enjoy this type of fishing and they each use a fairly long rod.
187833,MuddyWater,2008-04-16 00:18:00,218,"after the 26th i will be straight trouting brookies, browns and rainbows OH MY"
187948,jdmls,2008-04-16 02:36:00,575," WOW.....that thing is ancient, and I am not talking about the fish !!! Hey whatever works for ya..."
