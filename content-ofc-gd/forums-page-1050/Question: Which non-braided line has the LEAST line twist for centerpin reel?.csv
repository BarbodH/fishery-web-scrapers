187515,Guest Fishing For Life,2008-04-15 13:12:00,0,"Hi guys,  I am looking for non-braided lined with the LEAST line tiwst after putting on the centerpin reel.  Lets just stay with 10-lb test and the line was spooled properly from the filler  (I am using Halo P-line 10-lb ... twist like hell)"
187521,MJL,2008-04-15 13:26:00,2427,I've been using Raven and Maxima for years and never had a problem with line twist.  Are you side casting or pull/wallis casting?  You'll get a lot of line twist if you side cast.  Swivels should help alleviate twist to some degree.  P-Line Halo is a fluorocarbon and fluorocarbons generally are more prone to kinking and twisting when the weather is colder out.  Fluorocarbons also sink much faster than mono on the drifts...I don't use them for my mainlines.

187581,Rich,2008-04-15 15:36:00,3927,I was very impressed with the Raven float line. Minimum line twist and pretty good strength.
187585,Billy Bob,2008-04-15 15:39:00,5865,"The line itself doesn't cause twist, the reel and they way you spool it on causes most of your twist and the rest comes from how you fish.  Anytime you spool line onto a SPINNING reel you should either walk it all back off or run it behind the boat before using it. Of course make sure there is NOTHING tied on the end while doing this.  Bob"
187613,charlied,2008-04-15 16:49:00,584,I use siglon line
187637,Spiel,2008-04-15 17:56:00,9065," ....Exactly, if you're having issues with twist the problem lies with you not the line. If you're side casting don't! Learn to pull/wallis cast as MJL has suggested."
187639,canadian_copper,2008-04-15 17:59:00,925,LIKE EVERYONE HAS ALREADY SAID!!! SIDE CASTING CAUSES IT AND I RUN 2 SWIVELS ONE ABOVE AND ONE BELOW!!! I SIDE CAST AND HAVE ZERO LINE TWIST NOW!!
187666,steelhedrmatt,2008-04-15 19:06:00,278,"I use yozuri hybrid 6lb as my main on my pin. Never had any problems.  I spool it with about 300 yards, then if it starts to twist, pull off about 20 yards, retie, and your good to go.  Just remember to take the garbage line with you when you leave."
187785,OldPinner,2008-04-15 23:08:00,9, Youd think after THAT many years youd have learned how to cast.
187794,Gerritt,2008-04-15 23:21:00,6129,OldPinner.... I can see your going to be popular around here...  Welcome to OFC  G
187795,OldPinner,2008-04-15 23:25:00,9,Did I ask for your opinion gerrit?
187796,Gerritt,2008-04-15 23:26:00,6129,Nope.... but you got it anyways... good luck to you.  G

187811,Guest Fishing For Life,2008-04-15 23:42:00,0,I usually do pull/wallis cast if enough room for errors but 70% of the time I do side cast to prevent losing my float ..  my post is to ask which line is more resistant to line twist introduced by casting methods ..  Thanks
