187803,tjsa,2008-04-15 23:36:00,1578,"I am on my laptop now, main pc's hd is probably toast. So I do a search for it, find it, and go to the MODIS site to look at ice conditions.  I get this:  Forbidden You don't have permission to access /modis/modis.cgi/modis on this server.  Apache/1.3.26 Server at coastwatch.glerl.noaa.gov Port 80  Can anyone else check it, and see if they can see the satellite images please?"

187819,tjsa,2008-04-15 23:50:00,1578,http://coastwatch.glerl.noaa.gov/modis/region_map.html  This is the one I think I have used over the last few years.
187821,Sinker,2008-04-15 23:50:00,8692,"Crap......same for me......that sucks. I use that site almost daily!!!  Here's the link, maybe they're just having problems.....I hope!  http://coastwatch.glerl.noaa.gov/modis/mod...io.143.250m.jpg  This one kinda works, but its from way back......you can flip the pages and get to today though.  http://rapidfire.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/subsets...ua.721.250m.jpg  Sinker"
