187779,irishfield,2008-04-15 22:47:00,26272,The light gets lit from the battery voltage.. to confirm correct polarity. Give it time... it might come around. Once it repolarizes itself it will probably charge.

Took 3 days with the charger on the main starting battery, but it came back to life. Now I have to put the charger on the 2nd battery, as the battery isolator is not doing anything to it so it seems. It may be toast, but have yet to check.  Gotta do the same thing to my quad battery,   . Forgot to remove it last fall. Took 2 hrs. for it hooked up to my running truck to get enough of a charge to turn it over.  Give the charging a bit of time, it may recover, and if you can remove the covers to test the battery cell's electrolte's specific gravity, do that. It will tell you if you need a new one."
