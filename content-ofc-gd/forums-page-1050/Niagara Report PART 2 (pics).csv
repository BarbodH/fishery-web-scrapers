187890,Cast Adventures,2008-04-16 01:22:00,74,"Current water temps on the lower Niagara river are 34.5. Super cold, steelhead are still in their winter patterns located in all drifts right to the lake.      At this rate, looks like some of the best Niagara Steelhead fishing is yet to come! The bite last season kicked into high gear when water temps hit 36 or greater.      At this time of year the dams can really pump out the mud causing the lower sections to become stained, while above the dams will remain clear. Those with small outboards can not reach the clearer water. Try these stained water tips, they've helped us boat fish when conditions are tough.    -Streamers (experiment with colours for best results) with corkies -Plastic grubs in white with bright corkies -roe with yarn tied with a snell knot -kwick fish -spin'n'glows with roe bags -corkies with roe bags    Niagara hogs to come in part 3!  See you on the River,  Paul Castellano Cast Adventures"
