I don't know if your Jimmy is a 4WD, but try pulling the boat out on a steep wet ramp in 2 WD... if your tires spin, you may have trouble on wet roads. It wouldn't take much for that boat to push the assend of that Jimmy around on a wet road and jack-knife you into a ditch or oncoming traffic."

Boat/trailer/80 gallons of fuel and fishing gear gotta be up around 5500lbs. I don't even know it's there. Fuel consumption does.. but driving wise no issues. Of course the Jimmy has a short wheel base.. and that would be my fear as Gerry has pointed out when you need to swerve.  Remember it doesn't take long to add up the weight. That boat's probably 1900lbs.. motor 650.. fuel 6lbs per US gallon..fishing equipment 400+lbs(oh.. only me..lol.. remember downriggers/planner masts/tackle boxes/supplies)..kicker motor another 125.. trailer 1000lbs or so..etc. The one thing I do when I can is to wait until destination to fill the tank.. especially with mine holding almost 500 lbs of fuel.  Oh.. and don't forget to buy a set of mirror extenders. Nothing erks me more than people towing stuff and they can't see where they've been (ie if anyone is behind them/beside them to make safe lane changes and driving decisions."
187775,Bernie,2008-04-15 22:44:00,3190,"In my opinion you will be overworking the Jimmy. It may do the job but it will be taxing the drivetrain. Most engine compartments are tight these days but the Jimmy/Blazers, water would have a hard time flowing down through  . All the heat developed in the engine/transmission and front axle just builds up in there. Full size long bed or extend cab pickups work the best for towing (o ya suburbans and avalanche too). If you are determined to use it get a very good trans cooler installed. Make sure you keep your A/C condensor and radiator clean to allow good airflow to keep things cool as possible. Get some top line brake pads installed. The Wagner Thermoquiet pad has very good stopping power and is resistant to brake fade. There are other pads on the market that work well too but these have been the best for me in customer satisfaction. Just dont cheap out on friction materials there is a tremendous difference in performance and longevity. Trailer brakes need to be maintained as well. The brake shoes on trailers seem to come apart yearly. Not sure if it's because they sit for long periods or if they are just crap to begin with. If they are a hydraulic surge brake make sure the master cylinder is full of brake fluid and not water. Seems every other one I check is half water. If electric brakes check the wiring to them. More often than not there is a broken wire or two. Ice chunks seem to pull the wires off if used in winter. When you have the drums off apply the trailer brakes and make sure each magnet is working. They can go open circuit internally."
187955,John Bacon,2008-04-16 02:42:00,3277," The weight of the truck itself does not count toward the towing capacity.  However, it does include the weight of any passengers and cargo inside the truck.  A couple of big guys can take four or five hundred pounds off of your towing capacity."
