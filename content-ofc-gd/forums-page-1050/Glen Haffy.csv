187757,Meely,2008-04-15 21:48:00,282,Well......cabin fever has just about taken its toll    . Thankfully Glen Haffy opens this Saturday (as per their web-site) I know nothing beats being out on a lake but I have to admit I enjoy spending time fishing here when I cant get aways up north.......  Anyone else goin??  Meely
187771,crappieperchhunter,2008-04-15 22:27:00,2582,Have made plans to fish cats on the saturday Meely or I just might come over for a boo as I have never been there. No point in going after you guys are there though... Tony will have had a hook into every fish in there... so they will all have lockjaw Sunday. Cept for the ones that go home for the frying pan.  Enjoy the day.
