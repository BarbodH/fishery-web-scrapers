BUT.......... no andrew no sandy no jp  My OFC brothers and sister were shut out the past two issues except for Bunk's article in the Winter issue.  Their contributions have made EA better.  Hopefully this is not a trend that will be continued."

Time I set aside for that has been hindered with new work related business I took on this year, and unfortunately the only article I found time to create was a BC sturgeon piece I hope to see headed for somewhere that can use such an article.  Magazines don't want Star Wars Kesagamium pike, ninjas and Mats Sundin fantasy fishing articles.    It's no fault of EA's at my end... I hope to contribute with them in the future as they're a super bunch, and I do have plans too write more pike and eye shhhtuff once a few sticks I've got to burn take flame."

They are surely keeping the best for last, as it were. EA could also spread their wings and pick up a couple more....I'd bet on Raf and Perodimi.  Dang! I forgot Guidofisherman...one of the best."
