188501,Sebastian,2008-04-17 02:24:00,208,ya i got the April/May 2008 one a while ago.
188508,BillM,2008-04-17 02:35:00,17367,"Frig...  funds were withdrawn on the 7th of March, you'd think I'd have a magazine by now.  Looks like I need to make a couple of phone calls."
188601,cranks bait,2008-04-17 12:27:00,721,"This is why I do not subscribe to any mags.  I have found in the past that it could take up to 4 months before you saw anything and it was usually on the stand before I got it.  To top it off, only about 3/4 of the mags would show up with an automatic renewal at about the 3rd one?  I don't blame it on the mag it self, it is the distribution companies that take care of all this stuff.  Pain in the arse."
188604,BillM,2008-04-17 12:30:00,17367,My Ontario Out of Doors arrived 2 weeks after I submitted my subscription   Lets hope the people at Musky Hunter can help me out today.
