186265,solopaddler,2008-04-13 01:42:00,8605," Hey Drew, you're welcome to join me anytime if you can ever swing it bud. And yeah, new camera. After my ice fishing trip when my old one froze up on me I snapped and bought a new Olympus. Supposed to be freezeproof shockproof and waterproof (perfect for me  )."
186289,mattyk,2008-04-13 02:18:00,2110,great report!
186309,Bly,2008-04-13 02:40:00,1556,"Great report Mike!   Thank you for taking the time to post all those pictures and write it up, enjoyed every word!  oh and nice fish!!!!!"
186379,Ramble,2008-04-13 04:32:00,713,Excellent report. Those where some great photo's and I'm glad you had a good trip.  -R-
186391,Master of Bait,2008-04-13 05:27:00,196,"Sick.  Looks like an unbelievable trip.  Best thing is you didn't let the ""green"" guide get you down.  Everyone's gotta start somewhere.  Doesn't look like it mattered anyway as you really CRUSHED them.  Nice job!"
186408,lew,2008-04-13 10:08:00,12767,"Thanks for that Mike, it made for an excellent early morning read !!  Good of you to help out the new guide and show him a few tricks too"
186409,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-04-13 10:20:00,1362,I sure am envious..  ....great report!!!
186412,b2kptbo,2008-04-13 10:38:00,1505,"All in all musta bin a great outing, beauty report, thanks..."
186420,Tarzan's Jane,2008-04-13 11:06:00,1183,Enjoyed reading your report...great pics.  You gotta love Tim.  He is going to be making himself a bit more $$$ after his experience with you     at least I hope he does.
186464,dobee,2008-04-13 13:39:00,301,"great report mike, you guys did very well... im filled with jealousy."
186475,Joey,2008-04-13 13:55:00,9122,Just a fantastic report Mike.  Really great pictures.  Well put together.  Great job.  Joey
186499,TJQ,2008-04-13 14:57:00,7806,Solid report... awesome!! thanksl!
186528,Mike the Pike,2008-04-13 16:32:00,3421,I was waiting for this report Mike always a great read and thanks for taking all that time to put it together.  Was that an old Honda 4 stroke on the back of the drift boat?  Had one like it awhile back 7.5HP it was 26 yrs old when I sold it and always ran problem free.   
186544,solopaddler,2008-04-13 17:54:00,8605," That's exactly what it was Mike. The old thing ran great, started first pull every time except no shear pin  .  Thanks to one and all for the great feedback and positive comments, much appreciated!"
186619,Gawel,2008-04-13 21:16:00,27,Wow! posts like this that make me really want to expand my steelhead horizons.  much to the fiances disappointment.
186635,tbayboy,2008-04-13 21:56:00,1497,"Sounds like a great trip Mike, way to roll with the weather and new guide punches.  I get the sense this might become a regular road trip for you."
186882,ccmtcanada,2008-04-14 11:35:00,7971,"Another great report!  I'm glad that you got all that ID stuff back in time for this awesome trip.  Whenever I read one of your reports, there is always something in there that makes me think how I can apply some it to my own outings....that's one of the things I love about reading them.  I'm pretty limited in my experiences so far, but seeing posts like this makes me want to head out even more than I already do!  Thanks for taking the time to post...it's always a real treat to see one of your trips posted on here."
186893,John,2008-04-14 11:59:00,2956,"Great report from what looked like a great trip Mike. Glad you could help the rookie get established, it must be tough as I guess there's lots of competition."
186944,Paulus,2008-04-14 14:12:00,522,"Awesome trip buddy, I'm glad you guys had a good time  Looking forward to hooking up soon....  :clapping:  p.-"
187003,Reef Runner,2008-04-14 16:02:00,981,Amazing report.  Thanks for posting and sharing your trip with all of us.  reefrunner
187007,kennyman,2008-04-14 16:11:00,737,"Holy crap, that was unbelievable! You should have your own show.  I know it's a little different, but maybe they could slip you in on Extreme Angler? I've never seen a show where they catch steelhead like that. Plus it was very nice to see the backgrounds of the pictures."
187435,jdmls,2008-04-15 03:48:00,575,Just went throught your post again ....thought i would say thanks for the pick me up after another muddy non steelehading weekend....one day I keep saying to myself ...one day !!
187812,OldPinner,2008-04-15 23:42:00,9,wow great review for your buddy Tim.  Hope hes not trying to feed a family with his guiding.
187816,solopaddler,2008-04-15 23:47:00,8605, Thanks for the laugh  .
187884,FinS,2008-04-16 01:12:00,463,congrats Mike awesome report and tons of pictures just what we like keep it up
186027,wuchikubo,2008-04-12 17:06:00,1114,Another great report Mike! It's always a good to see your posts but I feel sorry for those without high speed internet with all your fish porn pics up LOL!  Too bad the weather didn't hold up for one more day for ya but you did get into some great fishing!
186029,johnnyb,2008-04-12 17:08:00,3413,"That is one heck of a report...and a really memorable trip!  way to go, and thanks for sharing"
186030,MJL,2008-04-12 17:13:00,2427,"That report was simply AMAZING!  Beauty pics to boot.  The Muskegon is certainly a much larger river than the ones I've fished most of my life.  No doubt a challenge finding features.  If you don't mind me asking, how much would a float trip like that cost?  Shoot me a PM if you'd like.  School ends for me this Wednesday and I'm sure it would make a pretty sweet graduation present - HINT HINT DAD"
186031,kickingfrog,2008-04-12 17:13:00,8333,"Much enjoyed, thanks."
186033,solopaddler,2008-04-12 17:21:00,8605," No problem, the trip was actually dirt cheap, hence the reason I went  . Normally a guide on that river will charge $400 for a full day with 2 guys. Tim's just starting out and is waaay undergunned boat wise compared to the rest of the guides so in order to compete he's waaay underpriced  . His rate is $100 a day for 2 guys (50 bucks a day each). Can't beat the price even considering his relative inexperience. As mentioned he's a super nice guy and you're still getting down the river and are able to fish it.. Shoot me a pm if you want his phone number."
186034,irishfield,2008-04-12 17:27:00,26272,Hey Mike... you got anymore pictures. I found that post pretty lacking! LOL  Great stuff bud !
186035,jonnybass,2008-04-12 17:30:00,346,"That is THE best report I've ever had the pleasure of reading!  Thanks for sharing that!  Too bad you got a rookie guide, but it sounds like it didn't matter much! You guys took him to school!"
186037,steverowbotham,2008-04-12 17:33:00,1800,Awesome!
186041,canadian_copper,2008-04-12 17:38:00,925,AWSOME REPORT DUDE!!! I AM ENVIOUS OF ALL THE PLACES YOU GET TO TRAVEL TOO!!! YOU MUST NOT BE MARRIED  LOL

186196,jdmls,2008-04-12 23:57:00,575,absolutely amazing man !!!  I still can't forget the road trip post you put up at about this time last year when you guys did so well down in the states...This is clearly a top candidate for the OFC steelhead post of the year !!!
186197,Harv,2008-04-13 00:00:00,19,"Looks like you had a pretty stellar day on the Muskegeon  there Mike.  Last Wednesday we ventured over to a river a little north of that and had a pretty decent day ourselves.  We did not have the benefits of a boat but we did a little legwork and were rewarded with some fresh chrome.  Great deal you found on the guide - there are a lot of drift boats over there as it really is the best way to cover much of that water.  Timing is everything and I think last week was Michigan's first real big push of fish this Spring.  Fails miserably in comparison to your photo gallery, but here is some of what we found.          Harv"
186210,medmart,2008-04-13 00:19:00,587,That was an awesome report and i enjoyed all those pictures thanks for sharing  Rob
186230,Moosebunk,2008-04-13 01:01:00,3970,Great show Mike.  Some super bows in that report.  Looks like a road trip may be in the future.  That's not the camera you usually use is it???
186261,solopaddler,2008-04-13 01:39:00,8605," Hey bud, just heard from Dave a little while ago sounds like you and Brian did just fine, some nice fish there! We were going to fish up there on Saturday, but as mentioned she blew out. Your timing was immpecable  .  Cheers"
