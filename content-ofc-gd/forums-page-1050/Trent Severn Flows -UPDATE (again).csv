Downstream water levels looked to be at least a foot higher.  No spawning walleys seen , although visibility was next to zero with the flow.  BTW If any one is missing about a 8' x 30' dock its jammed in the dam at Coboconk  Next visit - mid week  TB  APRIL 15 - STILL NO FISH ,this is starting to get boring ! Anther dock has appeared though ."
187028,wolfville,2008-04-14 16:41:00,396,Thanks for the update. Would love to bring kids to watch the walleye run. Never did that but always wanted to.

188507,Sinker,2008-04-17 02:34:00,8692,"  Yup, prepare for a ton of water out your way bud!!! Its on its way.......  Thanks for the update tinbanger. Do you think maybe the fish are there, but  your not seeing them due to the near record high water levels? Rice lake is approaching record levels, and still rising 5cm per day!!!!    Sinker"
188580,tinbanger,2008-04-17 10:38:00,1028,Sinker  MNR think the same re not seeing fish that are there . Just so much water and turbulnce that you can't see anything.  tb
188632,davew3,2008-04-17 13:31:00,430,I was talking to my sister in law in Campbellford.  she said the water is just ripping threw town there.  Very very high.
