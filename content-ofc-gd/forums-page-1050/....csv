188594,OhioFisherman,2008-04-17 11:49:00,6623,"Hey, ya, whats with the frost? wasn't any here this morning.  LOL Bernie don`t you still have 4 or 5 feet of snow on the ground? Heavy frost here too yesterday and gone by about 8 am. Might be the last of it though for a while, coldest day time temp here for the next 7 days is like 62 f.  Got to love those rip-rap banks Glen, local water supply lake has them all the way around it and a ton of crawfish hiding in the rocks. LOL now if I could only walk thru that stuff."
