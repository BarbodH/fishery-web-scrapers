187630,dsn,2008-04-15 17:34:00,1018,I decided to check out the island for some April/Spring Monsters but the water level was a foot higher everywhere. No fish was seen anywhere. However I did chum my usual  spots  But the Fares for the Ferry across the island has changed from $6.00 to $6.50 and the Spring Schedule takes effect April 18th.  dsn info changes
187647,Victor,2008-04-15 18:23:00,1609,i'm sure after a long winter all the fish miss you ... just taking them alittle while to find your offerings  man they raised it again? maybe you should tell them how often you go on the ferry and get a discount lol
187676,highdrifter,2008-04-15 19:17:00,2534,Thanx for the heads up.  Chumming... that's a good idea!  Do you find that the fish will stay longer in an area that you've baited?
187737,dsn,2008-04-15 21:08:00,1018," From what I have found in the past is that... once the carp find the food they will hang around longer. I was telling an OFC'er that last year I chummed a place before the carp started to appear. And once they started to appear they were around the chumming location already. I chummed the hole 2 more times early in the season  (April) and even tried to get one to hit but because of the massive weedbed my rig wouldn't sink to the bottom. So I didn't connect with any fish but they were feeding right on bottom. I could see them with their tails up.  The fish hung around through out the entire summer months (May, June, July, August)  even after I stopped chumming the spot. They just hung around. I ran into another guy who was fishing and he said to me ""The carp all seem to hang around this one area. I Don't know why?""  I just looked at him and smiled and said thats strange and walked away.  So yeah it does work!!  dsn"
