LOL  Just talked to the old guy just after lunch when he came by for some hardware... he has never had a skunk spray and he moves them in his mini-van miles from his home. Yes he puts a cover over the cage.. but has never had one spray on him. That's what I was going by... as like I said my way is lead to the head & don't smell..

One thing to remember is you have to be able to get the cat to the SPCE with in 2 to 4 hours depending on the rules where you live so that it is not considered cruelty to the cats. (Yes, it is not cruel for them to crap in your kids play area)  I know how people get rid of the strays out of town but in town this is the best way to save your arse from getting a trip to court."
