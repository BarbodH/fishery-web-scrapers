188252,Big Cliff,2008-04-16 20:33:00,6899,"It was a wonderful way to spend a morning with a good friend, the fish were just a bonus and the tree I caught has to have set some kind of a record for length but it didn't put up much of a fight. Beans never even offered to net it for me (well, actually I think he did ask if I wanted the net, this post will get edited if I try to repeat what I told him LOL)."

188356,ccmtcanada,2008-04-16 23:35:00,7971,"Good stuff guys!  Those whistle trout sure do fight don't they?? And those branches...wow....they've broken many a leader in my time...great job on landing that monster!  LOL.  Gotta love it when you don't need to dress in layers, or wear a float suit, battle frozen fingers and noses, and all that stuff."
