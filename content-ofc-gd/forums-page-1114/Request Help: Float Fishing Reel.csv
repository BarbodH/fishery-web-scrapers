138241,Guest Fishing For Life,2007-11-30 17:42:00,0,"Hi guys,  I realized that i am seriously into float fishing as time goes by ..  now the question is ... which float reel should I get?  I was told that normal float reel does not have a drag system, in which holds your line in place when fixing up hooks and at the same time can be used as spinning reel drag system ... therefore, drag system for float has to be custom made ...  is it true? and which one should I get?"
138247,Rich,2007-11-30 18:00:00,3927,I suggest to start out you go with an Okuma Aventa. That's what I have (just started pinning last year) and it works great. It doesn't have a drag system but you can flip a knob so it puts tension on in case you want to hook up your bait and walk through the bush or whatever. With a float reel you really shouldn't need a drag as that would take away the freespool aspect of it. Half the fun is using your palm as drag
138267,tonyb,2007-11-30 19:09:00,1637,"I'd say look into a J.W. Young Purist or Bob James if you are looking for a float reel with drag  ($$$ though!).  Here is the Bob James centre-pin:   Otherwise, all the rest are drag-free models and the Aventa is a good starter reel.  If you are looking for something a little higher in quality, you can't go wrong with an Islander...  Okuma Aventa:   and the Islander:   Have fun Christmas shopping  Tony Tony"
138271,bassjnkie,2007-11-30 19:21:00,1101,"Drag system. If i'm not mistaken, the angling spec reel has it, and I haven't priced it, but heard its big bucks.  I recommend Islander (highly recommend), Sheffield, Aventa and my fav. J.W.Young.  Daniel OCH"
138288,Guest Fishing For Life,2007-11-30 19:41:00,0,"Where can I get there from?  BPS and local stores dont have float reels ...  btw, how much are those?  Thanks again"
138295,MJL,2007-11-30 20:03:00,2427,"In terms of centrepins with a drag, the only ones I can think of off hand are the Angling Specialties and River Run reels.  Expect to pay close to or exceeding $1k.  Both have a disc drag in them.  Islanders IMO are one of the best mass manufactured reels on the market for the price.  You can find them anywhere from about $299 to $350.  J.W Young Purists, Bob James (various models) usually retail for over $399.  Tourney drifters and Loomis reels back in the day used to go for $230 but price has since increased the last time I saw one.  Can't remember how much Okumas (Sheffield and Aventa) go for but having spent a couple hours with one on the river, I found them to be excellent reels for the price.  I would recommend taking your rod to the store and seeing which one feels right in your hands. I personally don't like using large arbor reels (like the original Ravens) or reels larger than 4.5"" in diameter - I have smallish hands.  Sometimes when using ultra-light centrepins, you may find your rod to be very unbalanced.  If you can, try to find someone who has a few reels and take them out on the water to try - It'll save you $ in the end if you don't end up liking it.  As for places that sell them, you can check out Angling Specialties, Tightlines, Natural Sports and FishOnlineCanada...Those are the only ones I can think of at the top of my head."
138351,kentooley,2007-11-30 22:53:00,208,"Go see Dave (DMASSE) at Al Flaherty's Outdoors , if you're  in the Toronto area....he'll get you all set up.  Dufferin & Rogers Rd.  Chris"
138366,Burtess,2007-11-30 23:06:00,901,"If you are looking for a more reasonably priced float reel, you may want to look at the Aventa (as already suggested) or start scanning Ebay (don't forget the UK as well) for Adcock Stanton's, JW Young's and such.  Wait till the season has ended and everything is frozen over, they will be cheaper.  I bought my 5"" Stanton for ~ $125 CDN shipped to my door, as well as a JW Young Purist 2030 for ~$100 CDN.  Burt"
138376,Canuck2fan,2007-11-30 23:45:00,1444,"I am looking for a float reel too. I talked with owner of the store in Woodstock and he had a very convincing argument for the Sheffield.... He obviously has a ton of reels he can use but he goes for the Sheffield now, because he said it has the same bearing as the last Islander he bought. (his words not mine so flame him if you feel the need) Anyhow the price difference is about 100 bucks less for the Sheffield of course.  If you want you can buy the aventa and upgrade it by getting better bearings for it once you learn to use it. A search on googles should give you some links for doing that too."
138397,Fang,2007-12-01 00:53:00,1330,Bronte Outdoors has 6 or so different models. From the pictures I think they carry the Okuma Aventa as well as some Raven models. The Bob James looks familiar too. I think they had one with those spokes in the spool. Sorry didn't take note of prices.  I've been interested in a float reel too and have watched several Aventa VT-1002's go on Ebay over the last few weeks for just under $100. Thought that a decent price with shipping in around $20   I'll add another question for the float guys  I fish with a 12' and 10.5' steelhead rod and prefer some of the smaller streams. Lines have solid cork handles and I tape my spinning reels on. Any reason the float reel wouldn't work on a 12 or even a 10.5.
138405,bowshep,2007-12-01 01:31:00,378,"Nope the shorter rods will work with a Center Pin. The longer rods allow the energy to be distributed over a larger area, so you can use lighter test line and leaders. The longer rods allow for longer drifts with the line out of the water. The longer rods also allows you to see how far 14 ' really is. For a short rod recommendation l would have to say The Raven Specialist  About the Center pins get the best... l know of 4 Floatfishing people have more than 2 reels but use the expensive one most of the time... so that 100- 200 you spend will just collect dust and you will sell it for 50 bucks... but your good pin will be with you for a long long time... spend now or spend more and again later... For the Center Pin l have to go with Islander.  Ken"
138467,Bojangles,2007-12-01 08:00:00,46,"I'll second, third, fourth, fifth, whatever comment that was on the Islander. I wouldn't have two if they weren't solid reels."
138479,Baldy,2007-12-01 12:35:00,44,"All of the centerpins mentioned above will do the job adequately if properly maintained. The Okuma Sheffield is undoubtedly the best bang for the buck.  I bought one when they first came out for $249.00, a little glitter, top notch German bearings and a nice weight.  This reel used to get a lot of use. If you have no budget restrictions then there are a number of makers out there with quality products.  Arnold Kingpin & Islander Steelheader are 2 of the more popular reels and both are quality units.  I also have a Kingpin and have used a Steelheader and I don't really find them any better than the Sheffield. If you can find an older Stanton (AL reel foot) with little use and good bearings then you will have a reel that will spin all day. The Milner Kingfisher is also a quality Canadian made centerpin, a typical one man shop, hand made product.  Great reel, priced a little more than the Steelheader but IMO a better reel. There are also a number of smaller diameter float reels that mate well with shorter rods for smaller waters.  Any that I have or have seen are from the UK or Germany and range from 3"" to 4"" such as Hardy Conquest, G&Y Gypsy D'or, Young Seldex etc., none of which are made any more but are useful if you can find one in excellent condition and you like to fish smaller waters in the summer for panfish & trout."

138527,steverowbotham,2007-12-01 16:33:00,1800,BPS does carry float reels... top shelf in the same cabinet as the shimano stella and baitrunners.
138547,linweir,2007-12-01 17:57:00,202,No one recommand Raven centrepin? They're very reliable. Al Flarherty and Fishing online carry them.
138648,Fang,2007-12-02 01:17:00,1330,Spent a few minutes at Bronte Outdoors today looking at various reels. Really impressed with build and smoothness on the Scheffield. CDN $ seem to be around $259. Just found several US sites selling for $175.  Filled out an on-line order all the way through to the pay part to find out shipping. $12-15 USD to ship from the US  $70 cheaper to buy on line regardless of duty.
138656,floatfishin,2007-12-02 01:36:00,32,"Islander, best bang for the buck!  Cdn made, lifetime warranty and a dream to fish. Run you in the 350 range but worth the buck.  To start, the Aventa, or Shffeild, work horse reels and well worth the buck too.  I have 5 myself, even though I have 5, I always make the Islander the 1st weapon out."
138708,barracuda,2007-12-02 07:06:00,41,"Anspec runs either $650 or $750 these days, I forget which. In my eyes, worth the price tag. Milner Kingfisher and Milner Snipe are also fantastic reels if price isn't too important. For economy, Islander gets the nod from me."
