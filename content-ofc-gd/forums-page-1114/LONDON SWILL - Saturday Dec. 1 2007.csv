132931,Woodsman,2007-11-12 22:11:00,1286," John I might take you up on that offer. I'm on your way & I certainly know the way. But than you just might ""have to sit near some of the sorry looking lot"". My Packer hat can't miss a swill.  Best Wishes: Rick"

I'm not sure if the Spoke is still there....but I was in a band that played there from time to time.  Great memories of that place!  Also used to frequent the Elbow Room in UCC....I heard that's gone now....
133343,Woodsman,2007-11-14 00:56:00,1286,"And according to the wife ""barely house broken & not that well trained either"".   :blahblah1:"
133347,JohnF,2007-11-14 01:06:00,3494, Real men can't be trained. Eructation & flatulence were invented so we could assert that independence.  JF
133376,Woodsman,2007-11-14 01:42:00,1286," Damn that explains things. I'm independent. Although I expect she will say ""way too often""."
133397,JohnF,2007-11-14 02:18:00,3494, That doesn't mean it okay to stink up the car.  JF
134473,Vanselena,2007-11-18 23:57:00,269,"I'll be there, sound like good times!"
