138500,silveradosheriff,2007-12-01 14:23:00,1025,Just curious if anyone is using this and how they find it.  Thanks!  http://www.cabelas.com/cabelas/en/template...&hasJS=true
138501,bigfish1965,2007-12-01 14:25:00,3382,How would they be any different than a $5.00 card reader? The cheaper card readers work best because they don't have the capacity to check for DRM stuff.
138503,silveradosheriff,2007-12-01 14:36:00,1025,"I have never used a card reader, so it's all new to me. Can you use any card reader for the nav cards?"
138514,bigfish1965,2007-12-01 15:09:00,3382,"Try a cheap card reader from somewhere first. I can't imagine why it would not work..all it does is provide a conduit between the card and the USB port. The one you linked to is made by Lowrance and not the map company so there's no real way for it to know what DRM or encryption may be used. My computer's USB ports are finnicky and my card reader only works in one of the slots, but everything else works in all of them...so try all ports before giving up."
138532,silveradosheriff,2007-12-01 16:41:00,1025,Thanks Rick - I'll try that first.  Is is OK to put the nav cards in them?
138533,walleyemen,2007-12-01 16:44:00,316,"I think there protected , if not everyone would be burning copy's and i have not heard of that yet ."
138538,outdoorguy61,2007-12-01 17:14:00,220,"I would opt for the cheaper option to start as well. Note that the Navionics SD cards can be used with a variety of companys be it Ray Marine, Humminbird, Lowrance, etc. Just a tidbit.  outdoorguy61"
138553,bassjnkie,2007-12-01 18:36:00,1101,"A buddy of mine uses a $5 card reader from Factoy direct. The only thing you have to find is the program to view the charts. The charts are a compressed. I think my bud got the program from Lawr web site.  Hop this helps, Daniel"
138613,Corey,2007-12-01 22:58:00,355,"The Lowrance card reader has a device ID that is checked by MapCreate when MapCreate fires up. If you can find software to edit the Lowrance files then by all means get a cheap card reader/writer. If you plan to use MapCreate, get ready to buy a Lowrance card reader.  cd."
138633,irishfield,2007-12-02 00:15:00,26272,And if you really want one...check the classifieds. I have a map create set and a reader for sale there!
