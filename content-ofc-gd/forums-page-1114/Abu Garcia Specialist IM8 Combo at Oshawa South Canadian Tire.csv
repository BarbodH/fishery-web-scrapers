138665,ccmtcanada,2007-12-02 01:53:00,7971,"If you're looking for a nice rod/reel combo, there is one on sale at the Oshawa south Canadian Tire.  Bly and I were shopping in there today and noticed it, so we picked one up.  It's not in the flyer, so it may be an in-store special only.  Reg $74.99 Sale $34.99.  They had around 15 or so left...it's in the main aisle by the sports dept in a displayer if you want one.  Here are specs...       No smart remarks from Wayne about me advertising for Canadian Tire...and no annoying Canadian Tire couple jokes....LOL"
138670,Greencoachdog,2007-12-02 02:05:00,8163,Looks like a good Wall-ice rod Cliff!
138678,crappieperchhunter,2007-12-02 02:22:00,2582,Cliff..I don't need the rod. But for that price...throw the rod in the garbage and use the reel. When you say south Oshawa...you mean the CT by the Shwa Center?
138680,ccmtcanada,2007-12-02 02:28:00,7971," Yep....that's the one by the Oshawa Center...it's not an advertised sale price...I'd think they'll still have them tomorrow.  If you're gonna throw the rod out, I'll take it from you...if the price is right....LOL."
138681,irishfield,2007-12-02 02:29:00,26272, LOL Cliff... do it all you want.. it keeps Leah's Godfather in $'s !

138690,tdotfisherman,2007-12-02 03:18:00,317,"35 bucks! Wow, what a deal.. I have this rod/reel combination, and I can attest to how nice it is.. 35 bucks is an absolute steal.. If only I lived near Oshawa I would grab a second one right now.. If anyone's interested in a very decent spinning setup, good for bass, pike and walleye, pick this up now!"
138697,JohnF,2007-12-02 04:36:00,3494," I picked that combo up last summer at CTC for $39.95, put the reel on an Ugly Stick I had and stuck some other reel on the rod. It's a great deal.  JF"
138709,JorgeCarlos,2007-12-02 10:29:00,109,"i have the same combo for $29 couple years ago,great for the price"
138713,Shelley Cooper,2007-12-02 11:59:00,394,I picked the same set up last summer on sale as well.... I love it..
138731,crappieperchhunter,2007-12-02 13:28:00,2582,"CT opens in 32 minutes...I think I""ll grab whatever they have. I'm sure I can wrangle a few people on EBAY to pay me $50."
138851,urbanangler1990,2007-12-02 19:53:00,933,thats cool
138852,bbog,2007-12-02 20:06:00,665,That's a sweet deal! I checked on-line and it appears to be an unadvertised in store special. Wouldn't mind picking up one as a spare (can never have too many rods right?)  Thanks for info.
