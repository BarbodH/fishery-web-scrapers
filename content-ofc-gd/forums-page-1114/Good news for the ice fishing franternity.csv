The guy that cries cutting back and strikes fear into our children of gloom and doom while he and his family enjoy the comfort of having a $4000.00 per month utility bill.  Hmmm a freezing winter will help the naysayers of that theory to say ""See I told you so.""  Me I don't side with either platform on that subject, I just like to observe, laugh and say oh what ever you want to believe and shoot my mouth off. That's only, can I say it? Please  just my 2 cents worth."
