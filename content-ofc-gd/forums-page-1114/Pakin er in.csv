So I am going to put the boat to bed until ice out and hopefully that wont be to long, unless of course we have a nice warm spell ( sorry ice guys ) and I can get out once more but I doubt it.  Well I guess I will be trying to ice fish at some point.  For those of you who do get down there this weekend be careful and good luck.  Don"
