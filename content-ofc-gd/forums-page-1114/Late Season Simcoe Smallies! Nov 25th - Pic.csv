138249,Slayingm,2007-11-30 18:10:00,204,Although my boat has been away for a month now I managed to get out with a buddy of mine on Sat. for couple of hrs to freeze our butts off and try to find some last season smallies.  After not being able to launch at our 1st 2 spots (iced right up!) we finally got out at Virgina with the ferry breaking the ice there.  My managed to tag a number of big fish all in the 5 - 6lb range fishing 37 to 45' with tubes and hair jigs.... here is pic of a couple typical fish we were getting.....the latest I have been on Simcoe in a boat and what a blast!   Take care and good Fish'n...... Greg.

138257,ccmtcanada,2007-11-30 18:42:00,7971,"When you catch fish like that, it's amazing how warm you can feel in frigid temps...get the adrenaline going!  Great job and nice fish!"
138258,Roy,2007-11-30 18:46:00,13728,"Yeah, those two fish look REALLY familiar! WTG Greg, they're awesome smallies. Were they hugging the bottom at those depths? Beauties for sure, thanks for sharing."

138290,misfish,2007-11-30 19:48:00,29133,"Greg,your smile says it all.Real nice fish bud. Thanks for sharing."
138355,Mark Kulik,2007-11-30 22:58:00,348,Nice smallies as always Greg! see you at the shows!
138356,addict,2007-11-30 22:58:00,475,nice bass.correct me if im wrong isnt it harmful to the fishes swim bladder when they are dragged from that depth?
138360,Mark Kulik,2007-11-30 23:03:00,348,"Yes it can be, if released right away they are fine, but not if you keep them in the livewell, they have to be ""fizzed"", the smallies in the BPS tank were caught late fall and fizzed also, they are fine afterwards."
138439,Slayingm,2007-12-01 04:02:00,204," Roy... although we marked fish a few feet up from the bottom only the ones on the bottom would bite for us that day.  Like Mark K. mentioned in one of his posts a slow presentation was key.  We got most of our fish that way put I also triggered a couple by popping a tube then letting the line go slack so it would settle back on bottom.  ccmtcanada... you got that right.... I warmed right up after I boated my first fish.... a 21"" 5.5lb fish... G."
