137259,bucktail,2007-11-27 01:26:00,1857,Has anyone noticed the prices of fishing gear coming down yet. I stopped in Gagnon's on the way to the parents on Saturday and noticed Symetryes for 99.99. Thats a good deal but wondering if they just went down. Has BPS adjusted any prices? I just got a new camo parka from Cabelas for 99.00 US regular 275
137272,PERCHER,2007-11-27 02:21:00,787,Thats a great deal.I havent noticed yet but I am keeping my eyes peeled for a good deal on a Clam.
137313,JorgeCarlos,2007-11-27 03:59:00,109,does anyone know of a fishing gear store in Buffalo??? thanks
137325,barracuda,2007-11-27 04:33:00,41,"Try D-ick's Sporting Goods. There's a few of them around but if you're shopping with others, the one in Walden Galleria will probably the most convenient. They're far from specialists but they do carry a very good selection of stuff for a sports store."
137388,Blake,2007-11-27 13:24:00,418,Yes lures rods and reels and other fishing gear have come down.  Fishing World in Hamilton has been lowering prices on most of the new and old products.  Shimano rods and reels are a good example and they are great prices to get them now.
137399,BITEME,2007-11-27 14:02:00,1969,  MMMMMMMMMMMM ...........CLAM!
137410,fishinggeek,2007-11-27 14:20:00,325,"Is Fishing World in Hamilton as cheap as Le Baron?  I'd hate to drive to Hamilton to find out it wasn't.  Sometimes I find a steal on sale somewhere, but in general everyone's more expensive than Le Baron, even when on sale.  Does Fishing World have an online catalogue like Le Baron does to make it easier to compare?  Thanks."
137444,Zib,2007-11-27 16:57:00,369, You can probably get a better deal here depending on tax & shipping. The regular price in most US stores is $79.99.
137458,Tybo,2007-11-27 18:01:00,1373,"I ask one of the manager at BPS, why their prices where so high.  Managers response: The products where imported into the US first then ship to Canada.  I say: why would they do that, When you all ready have a Canadian import license.  So I say : that must be the reason why Canadian products are so high.  Why do I have a feeling I been lied too."
137476,fishindevil,2007-11-27 18:55:00,6254,"Well i have been watching several items and i havnt noticed any price reduction at all,  maybe on big bucks items,and even then its not much...the big deals are still in the states,like cabelas & BPS...no price reductions on fishing lures here at all  ,none on floater suits yet,so i think you have to do your homework....before you buy,and with our dollar its still the U.S.A. that has the deals"
138202,Golfisher,2007-11-30 15:20:00,586,"I swung by LB yesterday and saw that the prices on Shimano reels are finally down--about time, too!  Curado was around $210; still pricier than in the states, but that's 50 bucks less than what it used to cost."
138208,Puckhead,2007-11-30 15:26:00,377,  
138242,big guy,2007-11-30 17:43:00,414,"Abu-Garcia C-3 reels at Lebaron are $107 in the 2008 catalog, down from $127 last year.  One of the reasons why Bas Pro stuff is so expensive is because they have to pay their rent at the Vaughan Mills Mall and I don't want to think about how much that must be. They should have built their own stand alone store. There is no reason why they shouldn't be able to out compete Lebaron with the volume they sell across their entire netwok of stores. Lebaron has only 4 stores and their mail order, how many does Bass Pro have?"
138463,fishinggeek,2007-12-01 06:23:00,325,"Yes Le Baron is the best.  I make a point of getting practically all of my gear there, and if I go to BPS or some other place to browse, you can be sure I have my Le Baron catalogue in hand to compare prices.  Most of the time Le Baron is cheaper for the exact same item, and when it isn't, the prices are usually the same.  Rent or no rent, I can't justify paying more money for the exact same gear that I can get cheaper."
138470,holdfast,2007-12-01 08:28:00,1813,"Just a Question Here.  I too loved the Baron before Walmart, and Bass Pro Vahn.  Are they Canadian and do they have anything out West.  I shopped the Mtl And Ott stores only."
138519,Basser123,2007-12-01 15:36:00,3,reelfishingdeals.com has great prices on many of the Shimano reels. I just purchased 2 Citica 100DSV for $105.00 with free shipping. Delivery was very fast. These are both for Christmas presents. but now I may get another for myself latter on.

138523,walleyemen,2007-12-01 16:22:00,316,"TRy Gander mountain in Buffullo, they have amazing deals, and with our dollar being high even better. i bought my okuma trollong reels for almost 2/3 less there compared to here."
138596,Canuck2fan,2007-12-01 21:52:00,1444,"I ordered a bunch of stuff two weeks ago about 75 bucks worth of hooks, cliplights, floats and line and LeBarons with shipping/taxes in was 20% less that Cabelas it is simple for me I want to save and shop Canadian and LeBarons allowed me to do that. I just don't see the savings that everyone talks about from the U.S. I guess if you have already spent the gas and are there the deals can be had but when it comes to having most things shipped in from the U S of A the savings aren't there anymore in anything I have looked at lately. With one exception. I will say that I believe it is more the company Shimano shafting us than the retailers. Okuma, Pflueger, Shakespeare, Daiwa all seem to be within a couple bucks for price but Shimano reels and rods seem to differ by between 20 and 30 dollars on any item over 70 bucks. That they alone seem to be more tells me it has to be more than the retailer ""ripping"" us off. Shimano needs to sharpen their pencil a lot before I will buy any of there products regardless of who is at fault, because I don't like the gouging going on."
138621,jjcanoe,2007-12-01 23:15:00,744, Couldn't imagine saying that about 8 years ago!!!!!  jjcanoe
138663,brookieman,2007-12-02 01:50:00,68,"  Big Guy, not to be too harsh, but you should speak from what you know, not from what you believe to be true.  If you actually ""knew"", you would be aware that BPS is living rent free for now.  Part of their deal with the Mills corporation to get the store built.  You should also be aware of the fact a lot of the product in the stores was purchased and paid for long before the dollar reached parity.  No retail business in the world has prices that reflect daily currency markets...why??? because they would be broke quickly or their customers would complain consistently.  Think about it before you sling the mud guys.  It takes time to put orders through, receive merchandise, sort it, distribute it and finally stock it on store shelves.  If you owned a store would you sell at a loss because the dollar changed....i think not."
