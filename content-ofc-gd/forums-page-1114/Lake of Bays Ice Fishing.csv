I'm sure there has been a  thread about this before, but I can't seem to get the search feature to help.  I have a cottage on lake of bays, and I am a rookie fisherman.  Was looking to do some ice fishing this winter, and can't find anything online.  I was hoping someone could direct me to an outfitter who does ice fishing on lake of bays.  Any help would be great,  Thanks."
