138120,Kirk,2007-11-30 04:20:00,347,"JF, your post makes you appear to be a liberal voter...a very polite one albeit.  I agree with you somewhat that the pay and the slagging politicians get probably means most qualified people are smart enough to stay away.  BUT, there are definitely differences between parties in terms of the quality of people...and I won't go more into it than that (my shot at being polite)  Wayne: sorry to hear about that....I guess taking shots at land owners is the brainless vote getter, I am sure the money they take from you, which costs them the one vote they lose with you, they more than make up for when they hand out your money to many more bottom feeders.   They pick up all of those voters (way more than the one vote they lost with you).  Its how they got elected."
138232,JohnF,2007-11-30 17:05:00,3494," I see myself as more of a conservative dressed up in liberal clothes. If you mean the capitalized variety of Liberal, I was pre-conditioned by my Dad that the PC's were the only guys worth voting for. Then I decided on my own that I was more in tune with Liberal party policy although I almost went over to the dark side (NDP) for a while. In practice I vote for the man (or woman) now who sounds like they best represent the voice of reason in hopes that more folks will do the same and ultimately we'll end up with a whole mess of sensible people in control. I dislike partisan politics which I know is counter to my earlier words about the importance of solidarity, but I don't see the major parties as being loyal to anything as much as to their own power and position, paying lip service only to the good or the will of the electorate. I disagree that we don't get qualified people elected. It's more that the good ones get ground up by the partisan machine and are forced to toe the party line or get pushed aside. The major parties are too much about power and influence and not enough about what's best for the country or the province.  As for Wayne's situation the only thought that comes to mind, other than that it sucks, is that there should be enough voices like his to take a strong appeal to the OMB. I'm not actually sure that this even falls under the purview of the OMB but it's worth checking. Seems to me that it's a pretty arbitrary act and may be vulnerable to challenge if the OMB can hear it, and there's always the courts if that doesn't work. Is the gov't insulated against class actions in this type of situation? Was there any prior notice of this? I'm not really up to speed on all the ins & outs of Crown Patents so I'm not the one to really give advice but before I knuckled under I'd sure ask some questions of a lawyer, or even a planner, familiar with the process.

138240,Bernie,2007-11-30 17:40:00,3190,"  Isn't this something like what happened to the Romans? I was taught in school many years ago ""Those who forget the past are destined to repeat it"""
138250,JohnF,2007-11-30 18:11:00,3494, You mean bread & circuses? Yeah. That's part of it. We're suckers for instant gratification at the expense of long term gain and the pols know it full well. They do just enough pork barrelling to make us feel good temporarily while what they're really doing is protecting the party assets. Lotsa smoke and mirrors going on. Part of the problem is that too many of us are content to let politicians be politicians instead of responsible riding representatives.  JF
138255,SlowPoke,2007-11-30 18:37:00,2984,"Water quality and climate change, don't these matters fall under Ministry of Environment juresdiction? I'm not saying it does but merely suggesting these are amongst many matters that are overlapped by the MoE and MNR. Isn't it time to combine resources - infrastructure, biologists, management etc?  -Brian"
138269,JohnF,2007-11-30 19:17:00,3494," You're probably right about the crossover but combining resources might be tougher than solving all the problems we face. I suspect that the ministries are every bit as territorial as the various departments of large corporations, fiercely protective of every budget dollar. I think you'll find that the peripheral involvement of the first two is why OFAH doesn't address them directly as hot issues.  JF"
138424,CLofchik,2007-12-01 03:00:00,854,"This is the same person that while Minster Of Transport refused to allow single passenger motorcycles into HOV lanes, on the grounds that she compared bikes to Smart Cars and Miatas.  And then there is the fascist fiasco that is Bill 203.  I'm not expecting much out of her, and apparently neither is her party seeing as how the MNR is the red-headed stepchild of cabinet posts.   Face it, another 3 years of special interest boot licking and the accelerated decline of our outdoors was all but inevitable the heartbeat after she was shuffled."
138428,Sugarpacket,2007-12-01 03:24:00,82,I vote BBR as the new minister of natural resources after watching this rant he made last year  http://www.zippyvideos.com/182126759652843...200/bigbassrich
138429,Gerritt,2007-12-01 03:28:00,6129,Yup.... I vote BBR to run our country!!... god help us all....  We'll all be eating rock bass for Christmas supper!! by LAW!!!  LOL   Gerritt...  Ohhh and sucker for Thanksgiving!
138068,JohnF,2007-11-30 00:32:00,3494," Right idea. I just did some surfing and found the OFAH site (joined up too BTW). http://www.ofah.org/index.cfm If you go there click the ""Burning Issues"" tab top right and you'll see what they're lobbying for at the moment. I suspect these have been identified through discussions initiated in forums similar to this one and have been selected as the focus points that combine best saleability with optimal returns for the hunter/fisher types. It's a case of picking yer battles. Pick yer battle, gather yer facts, decide who is best to present the arguments, decide who is best to hear the arguments, and then take yer best shot. If there's solidarity, support & the right people saying the right things to the right pols, good stuff usually happens.  If we collectively agree with these points then perhaps there's something we can do as a group to help support the cause. It occurs to me that as I'm new to this forum and to fishing generally I may be gilding the lily here (perhaps this has all been addressed and dealt with long ago) so my apologies if I'm being redundant. Perhaps I should just shut up till I know more of what's really going on, huh?  JF"
138070,JohnF,2007-11-30 00:44:00,3494," You're making the assumption there is some ""roast beef"" representation. There are them what would argue you've only got ""weiners"" to choose from regardless of the packaging. And before anyone jumps to the conclusion that I'm slagging politicians, perish the thought. It's just that even the best parties & pols get jammed thru so many grinders that there's only one product that can come out the other end - and it sure ain't prime rib. I think it's more a matter of how you prepare the weiners that determines just how satisfied you'll be with the meal.  JF"
138072,Roy,2007-11-30 00:50:00,13728,"""Perhaps I should just shut up till I know more of what's really going on, huh?""  No John. From what I've read so far, you are leagues ahead of anyone I know on this board. I'd hire you as my/our representative anytime."
138089,JohnF,2007-11-30 01:37:00,3494," Thanks Roy. How's the pay?  And not leagues ahead by any stretch of the imagination. Not even ahead, perhaps just better informed for the moment, which is an easy fix. In between my silly posts (for want of any good fishing stories) I pay attention to what others post here. My take without actually meeting anyone yet face to face is that there are some pretty astute individuals in our midst, winners and/or leaders. No names though. They'll all get swelled heads.  One of the advantages(???) of doing what I do in real life is that you get to talk much of the time about important stuff and need to have a smattering of knowledge on almost everything under the sun (well - the Canadian sun anyway). Through my involvement as president of our local board I was drug into the PAC side of things kicking & screaming all the way, but I found I actually liked it, in no small part because we have a great federal PAC program and a staff to steer it. No single citizen can accomplish much in the political forum without some substantial support, a worthwhile cause & a great plan. Groups like OFC are a wonderful resource that too often lies untapped. We possess a valuable commodity here - a loud voice, some 2,500+ strong. But we need to act like a choir, not an unruly crowd, to get the best sound. How's that for a sick-making analogy?  JF"

128250,Gerritt,2007-10-30 22:30:00,6129,http://www.donnacansfield.onmpp.ca/   Time to start asking her the tough questions...  Gerritt.
128254,misfish,2007-10-30 22:37:00,29133,Looking at that Ger.I dont think it will be hard to shut her down as a MNR repersentive.   THIS IS A JOKE
128265,Gerritt,2007-10-30 23:00:00,6129,"Hon. Donna Cansfield,  As Minister of Natural Resources... I have a quick question...Ok maybe I have more then one..  Have you ever hunted or fished?  If the answer is no how do you expect to be able to manage a department that is devoted to the above? When you have little to no experience with either?  No wonder people are dismayed with the MNR and see it as a farce. Putting people in leadership roles without having walked the walk. You cannot accurately assess a situation from behind a desk at Queens Park, or having a picnic in High park...  I just hope you don't further damage an already fragile department.   Will you put more CO's out there in the field protecting our resources? Will you make sure they have gas in their trucks to do their jobs? (incase you did not know... They can not afford gas for regular patrols)   Will you look at reinstating the Spring bear hunt? The science is flawed we all know that, as it was paid, bought and financed by private interests... Want the truth about bears? Talk to the people living in Northern Ontario that are dealing with them... They walk the walk, hard to know what a bear problem is in Etobicoke   Looking at your Bio you appear to be more of a Environmental Crusader then someone who has knowledge or compassion in our hunting and fishing traditions, if you would not mind... Would you tell me if you have any affiliations with any private environmental entities/campaigns?   You now have tens of thousands of sportsmen and women looking at you now,  Time for some answers to the tough questions,  Sincerely,  Gerritt W. Aalbers"
128268,misfish,2007-10-30 23:10:00,29133," This is one answer I would like a response to. I wish I had my camera the other day when I seen a local MNR truck that was rusting out and the logo half missing. Total disgrace.  A couple of guys names come to mind to represent the MNR. John Kerr,Wil Wigman. IMO"

128356,danc,2007-10-31 02:42:00,4677,"Nothing will change. The Minister is just a puppet. It's time that we all realized that. The future of our resources is in our hands. Not the provincial or federal governments. The writing has been on the wall for years, despite douG's chob."
128363,bigfish1965,2007-10-31 03:33:00,3382,"Unless the government is willing to up the amount of money going into the MNR, the Minister in charge is irrelevant. Very."

137763,lstrongman,2007-11-28 20:04:00,1," If the Ministry of Natural Resources is “devoted” to Fishing and Hunting would it not be called the Ministry of Fishing and Hunting? In fact fishing and hunting is part of a much larger portfolio encompassing Forestry, Mining, Land and Water management, Parks and Recreation etc. Look it up and learn something about the department before dismissing Donna Cansfield for not fishing or hunting."
137765,ketchenany,2007-11-28 20:16:00,3229,The Hon. Minister probably never mined or chopped down a tree either . . . Oh never mind . . .

The MNR, though not engaged solely in hunting and fishing management, has an enormous responsibility to outdoor enthusiasts in these sectors as they greatly affect the economy and the resources we have. The MNR, although unable to do as much as they should because of their underfunding, deals with hunting and fishing in most sectors in some way or another. I wouldn't choose someone who doesn't hunt or fish or is unaware of the importance of these activities to the economy, Canadian society as well as a long Canadian hunting, fishing and trapping tradition.  Bill Parker"
137773,Hookset,2007-11-28 20:31:00,367,"  Hmmmm you must be a politician ""Never Fished"". I can tell because, instead of answering the question, you simply replied with a snotty, non constructive, attitude. Maybe try responding again with something constructive, maybe try and appease some of us. You remember us right ? We're called taxpayers as well as Outdoors people. We have the right to ask these types of questions. You might find several members here know more about the other items in the portfolio than you do. I may be wrong in saying you are politically motivated so please feel free to respond. Try it in a manner that may incite discussion. It's what we do here. Looking forward to your educated response  Good Luck    Hookset."
