138961,forrest,2007-12-03 02:03:00,1032,Last time I went in their prices seemed a bit steep.  How are their prices on fish finders?
138995,Photoz,2007-12-03 09:21:00,792,"I was in Saturday, I bought a membership to 'Club Lebaron,' ($25.00) then bought 2 pairs of good walking / hiking shoes, (Garmont) got a 20% discount which saved me $92.00!! The service & attitude in there is like a new place since BPS started up . . . .    anything I've checked, price-wise, against ALL competition, has either been lower, or equal. But . . . . .    they have their return policy posted, in the store & at the cash-out, and will enforce it . . . . .     no receipt . . . .    no bring-um back . . . .    PERIOD! I saw some dummy trying to exchange a reel there last summer . . . .    claimed he lost the receipt . . . .   but he forgot to take a BPS sticker off the bottom of the box!! Even though it was obvious where he bought the reel, he STILL insisted he had no idea how that sticker got on it!! He (according to the sticker) had also paid about $10.00 more at BPS. It's because of people like that, stores HAVE TO enforce such rules . . . ."
