But . . . . .    if you DO NOT have a 'Club Lebaron' discount card, if you buy one, you instantly get your 20% off. Plus, the card is good for 10% discounts all year. I need high end footwear for my job . . . .     by buying the Club Lebaron card today for $25.00, I got 20% off $460.00 . . . .  .   $92.00 . . . . .    I'd say I'm ahead of the game!  They have a whole truckload of what their counter staff seem to think are NEW regulations books . . . .    I grabbed one . . . . .    which clearly says on the cover '2005 / 2006 / Valid until December 31, 2007.' Does the REAL new regs clearly say '2008?'"
