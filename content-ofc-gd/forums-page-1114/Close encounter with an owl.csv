I approached very slowly and shone my flashlight on it an sure enuff it was an owl staring back at me. I kept inching towards it and got within 8' where I stopped. We just sorta stared at each other for about 30 seconds before he took off.  I couldn't believe I was able to get so close to him.  I didn't have my camera with me, but what an incredible way to start my day  I Googled owls and came up with this, and I'm pretty sure this is a picture of what I saw, and it's also about how close I was to him.  Beautiful !!  "
