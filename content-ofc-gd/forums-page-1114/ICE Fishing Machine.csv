138675,TJQ,2007-12-02 02:15:00,7806,Ill save that for when I retire and have lots of money like Lew does... LOL
138676,Fisherman,2007-12-02 02:21:00,7201,Well lets bring him up into this part of the world and add a foot or two of snow and see how far he gets.
138677,irishfield,2007-12-02 02:21:00,26272,"Add 7"" of snow...and yah ain't goin anywhere in that golf cart."
138719,dsn,2007-12-02 12:28:00,1018, Thats exactly what I was thinking. Useless!!! I guess who ever designed it doesn't go ice fishing or their lakes are plowed of all snow. And they just have flat ice.
138724,Spiel,2007-12-02 12:51:00,9065,....Interesting concept but I think grossly under powered for our clime. I'm thinking four wheel drive would also be a must and of course you'll always need a partner to step out and hook up the winch on those occasions when you bust through.
138729,crappieperchhunter,2007-12-02 13:21:00,2582,Can't tell from the photos....does it have heated seats...or more importantly...CUP HOLDERS !!!
138733,lunkerbasshunter,2007-12-02 13:36:00,2585,yeah that isnt really a good investment if your in snow country.  i can see that thing getting stuck big time in the snow.  I think i rather have a snobear.  Cheers!
138747,Muskieman,2007-12-02 14:24:00,2472,Where's the track???  Skis??   where are these people fishin?  all ice no snow.. that thing wouldn't go 50' on Nipissing.. ...Looks like a Limo version of a Golf Cart.   NOT  Snow Bear... no prices though .... looks Very expensive.
138749,irishfield,2007-12-02 14:32:00,26272,Don't have to go far to find a Snowbear dealer here! LOL  What are they Bernie... $45k
138754,Clampet,2007-12-02 14:48:00,1947," You got that right. Most are designed without a thought to real winter conditions and temperatures.  I remember some of the older snowmobiles (1970's and some 80's models) would be useless after bouncing through snowdrifts on the lake.  The vents would suck up the snow and clog the carbs.  Then after sitting around in the -20 C temps, would freeze up and would be next to impossible to start."
