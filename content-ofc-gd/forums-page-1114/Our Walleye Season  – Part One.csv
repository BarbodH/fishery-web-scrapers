137609,Jacques,2007-11-28 03:06:00,97,"Thanks for that, Cliff.  Those of us that are 'quieter' on the board get to feel like we know you guys a little, based on your excellent reports.  You're one on the reasons I keep coming to this site every day.  Well a couple of times a day.  Well several times a day...  Awesome fish!"
137629,The Urban Fisherman,2007-11-28 05:01:00,2050,as if! haha  you guys rock!  Congrats!  Ryan
137665,Terry,2007-11-28 13:44:00,14456,  I am sure you will have it all figured out by next BOQ  when I checked the moon/sun/tide/major/minor best times charts the days we went to BOQ they were the worst days possible to catch fish  for next year maybe we should check the charts before  we set a date
137679,ccmtcanada,2007-11-28 14:04:00,7971, I hear you...and make it a week or two earlier if the charts line up...a few degrees in air temps makes a huge difference...LOL
137690,Golfisher,2007-11-28 14:44:00,586,I knew this was coming sooner or later; great report!
137829,Mike the Pike,2007-11-29 00:45:00,3421,Yes I am looking forward to report #2.No more boat excuses you have been out with enough OFC members and you both have boated fish before
137905,MJL,2007-11-29 04:19:00,2427,"Those are real bigguns! WTG  Great report and pics...I've never really gotten into walleye fishing but after seeing those monsters, I may have to give them a try next season."
138308,fishnsled,2007-11-30 20:32:00,3520,Finally have sometime to get caught up on the board and see I've missed a lot!!!  Nice fish you two!  Looking forward to part 2.
137293,ccmtcanada,2007-11-27 03:15:00,7971,"Well, it's been a while since Bly and I have posted any Walleye (Wall-ice for Glen, Pickerel for many others) reports, and now that the season is over, here's a little summary of how we did this year.  We fished right up until mid December last year, but this fall has proven much colder, and changed the pattern quite a bit.  After having the season we had last year, we knew it would be very hard to beat and although we didn't catch any personal bests, we still had a pretty good year.  We cant wait to try for these guys from our boat next year!  We have learned a lot about catching these guys from shore, and I'll share a little bit of info that we've found out.  For some reason (I don't know why), in early fall, they hit spoons and nothing else.  After that stops working, it seems the only thing that works is Jigs tipped with twister tails or worms.  Once they stop biting those, it's exclusively crank baits.  We dont use live minnows...so we have no idea how well they'd work.  Anyhow, here are some pics...most are from shore, but some are from assorted fishing trips in boatsâ€¦..enjoy the fish porn!  This one was caught on a spinner in July....a small 22"" one....but also one of my only ones caught when the sun was still up...LOL.   In mid-July, this one was caught up on Ahmic Lake.  It was the only walleye that made it to our dinner table.    This proves that Bly actually does catch some small fish....LOL.  Caught on the infamous Jumla!!!   Fishnsled took us out hunting muskie and this is the only fish I caught that day...this one ended up on HIS dinner table...hehe.   We did a lot of searching this fall.  The following pics were all  caught at night in a few different locations.  We even dawned our  waders to try out some new spots and had a bit of luck.  Bly started out the fall season by catching this nice one in September.  It measured 27"" and weighed 7.5 pounds.  Sorry about the quality...I forgot the good digital at home and took this with my phone.   This one came in at 29"" and 8 pounds.  It was our second smallest fall walleye, but is a cool shot because it's fins are all up....   They started to get a bit bigger....  Bly's 29"", 8.8 pounder   Bly's 9 pounder...and 31""   Finally...here's a 9 pound 14 ouncer....measuring 31 inches...   That's it for now....stay tuned for part 2...the bigger fish will be in that report....coming in a week or two!"
137294,007,2007-11-27 03:22:00,537,"Hey Cliff - some fantastic fish there - puts most of the ones I've caught in the 'minnow' category.  Congrats to Bly too for catching the big ones!  Great pics , thanks for sharing.  007"
137298,solopaddler,2007-11-27 03:26:00,8605,"The bigger fish in part 2? LOL! That's incredible Cliff, you and Carole are really on to something there."

137343,Greencoachdog,2007-11-27 07:12:00,8163,"Excellent report and pics!!!  ...

I'm really lookin' forward to part 2 when you get the chance to post it!  Now if you'll excuse me... I need to go drown my lack of Wall-ice sorrows in a tumbler of rum"
