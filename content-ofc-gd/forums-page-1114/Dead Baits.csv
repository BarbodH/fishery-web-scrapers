138113,Weeds,2007-11-30 03:37:00,782,"Hey everybody, I have a few questions regarding dead baits, as I have never really tried using them before. I have read the regs (2006-2007) and am curious if I can use something I might buy at the supermarket, frozen sardines or mackerel  for example. It's not one of the species they mention in the guidlines but I kind of figure they are referring only to live bait with their limitations, as they make no mention of chicken livers, bacon or any of the other strange baits I have heard of people using.  It would just be more convienant for me to occasionally hit the supermarket or China Town  than speciality bait shops.  Thanks  I have also heard a rumour that according to the new regs that: ""Only Live or Dead Baitfish less than 5.1 inches in length can be used as bait.  This is for all of SE Ontario (Zone 18) with the exception of the Ottawa River (Zone 12).   I guess that wouldn't effect me but I imagine others won't be too happy."

138245,Weeds,2007-11-30 17:54:00,782,So does anybody know if I can use frozen Sardines?
138260,wallyboss,2007-11-30 18:50:00,1095,"Yes you can but only until Jan 1, 08 then it will have to be under 5.1"""
138379,Weeds,2007-11-30 23:54:00,782,Is Toronto zone 18? I'm more familliar with divisions and my computer is taking ages to load up maps.
138502,Sunny,2007-12-01 14:32:00,5,"No Toronto is not in Zone 18.  It only runs to the Ottawa River on the East Side and on the West side ends around Trenton, Stirling area.  Toronto is Zone 16 inland.  And if you are fishing Lake Ontario it falls in Zone 20."
138630,FinS,2007-12-01 23:57:00,463,  no doubt
138634,irishfield,2007-12-02 00:16:00,26272,Applies on Lake Temagami now.  Live or dead bait must be less than 5.1 inches.
