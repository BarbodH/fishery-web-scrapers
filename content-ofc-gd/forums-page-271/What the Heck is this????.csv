When we started trolling down-wind, the graph was filled with images that we couldn't figure out.  Is there anyone there who has seen this and does ANYONE know what the heck it is?    To see a larger photo hit this  http://s138.photobucket.com/user/superdad4sure/media/IMG_1794-GraphImage-4x6_zps08e74295.jpg.html?sort=3&o=5#/user/superdad4sure/media/IMG_1794-GraphImage-4x6_zps08e74295.jpg.html?sort=3&o=5&_suid=138470447481206648844799875312   David  aka  Superdad"
818889,Terry,2013-11-17 16:35:00,14456,seem late to be turning  over  but any time there is a big change in water temp it can turn
818890,misfish,2013-11-17 16:41:00,29133,I know. Terry does this all the time. Turn your simulator off.  No idea.
818891,Terry,2013-11-17 16:43:00,14456,ouch!!!!
818893,Joeytier,2013-11-17 17:22:00,3990,Da walleyes are stacked like cordwood!!!
819080,Steve,2013-11-19 00:02:00,2075,"i agree with Terry.  no quinte walleye (or very few) in that photo.  if you get that, turn down your sensitivity until only the largest ""marks"" are readings.  those are the ones you are after."
