818034,hammercarp,2013-11-12 05:53:00,964,I was sent this series of pictures via email a while ago. This took place in northern Ontario. Two Conservation Officers rescued this moose from a lumber mill settling pond. I finally got around to putting the pictures into a slide show. Hats off to those guys. http://s588.photobucket.com/user/hammercarp/slideshow/Moose%20Rescue .

818084,Fang,2013-11-12 17:56:00,1330,"she is a he guys,  by photo's you can see the start of yearly antler growth in behind the eyes on a few shots. I'd guess this might have been spring time from the growth and that is a pretty tall body. That animal would have much greater mass in the fall  Good job by that crew"
818087,davey buoy,2013-11-12 19:07:00,5505,Well he's back to himself then lol.  .Great job.
