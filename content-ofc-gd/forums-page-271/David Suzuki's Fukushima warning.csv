I can not imagine how many resources it would take to properly clean up the fukushima plant issues. In fact, I'll bet that it never gets cleaned up properly and that it will cause serious economic and environmental problem for many countries for many years. It'll take  A LOT of policital pressure and probably the threat of war or trade bans to actually see this get attempted to get fixed, versus 'seeing what will happen', which is exactly what will happen."

818086,Twocoda,2013-11-12 19:04:00,4130,"David Measday, nuclear and particle physicist (University of British Columbia) “People are really exaggerating this. I mean, over 20,000 people were killed in the tsunami. As far as we know, no one was killed by radiation.” ""as far as we know"" self admittance to inconclusive research..its obvious they haven't done their homework. Marcello Pavan “As scientists talking around the lunchroom, we are more or less of a unanimous opinion that the hysteria around Fukushima is grossly overblown [...] With the supersensitive detectors we have at our disposal, [radiation] levels are way below anything that anybody has to worry about. We're subjected to background radiation from the moment we're born. I mean, every banana you've ever eaten has radioactive potassium in it.” If there are no bananas in their lunchroom then the only threat they would have is the microwave oven (providing it was turned on with a improperly fitting door) The ""banana ""statement comes from the nuclear industry for acceptance to radiation levels for the masses...it has worked over the years... Marcello Pavan “That is absolutely correct, at least from what I see. TEPCO has been minimizing the effects of what is happening. But here we have a large industrial concern lying to the government about an accident related to its business—is that news?” When the health and welfare of people are at risk then yes...this is news...BIG NEWS!! David Measday “It's very difficult to find exact information, because of course they don't tell you everything. I've talked to a few Japanese physicists, but they don't know either. But now they have no reason to lie about the amount of radiation there is [...] The critical thing is, what is the level and how bad is it for humans?” Self admittance to inconclusive research again..last i checked there are still flights going to Japan and your allowed to take those ""super sensitive  machines"" on them...but hey save the money on airfare and talk to ""scientists"" that cant answer questions and draw your conclusions from them...tsk tsk 3. “...if there's another earthquake of 7 or above, that building will go and all hell breaks loose.” - Suzuki  David Measday “Chernobyl actually exploded half the reactor into the atmosphere. That's as bad as you can get. At Fukushima, there was nowhere near that level [...] I don't deny there could be a small chance that things could go wrong. An earthquake or tsunami would probably be the worst, but if it's of that magnitude the radiation would be a much lesser concern.” Look up FACTS about Chernobyl and see/read the glorious things it has done to society..you wont find many happy things but your guaranteed to find devastating things that continue to this day from its meltdown. The mutated children that died at birth seems to be the best blessing available for those affected. A Tsunami will last (generously) two weeks as an event and the healing and rebuilding will move forward. You can apply the same timeframe to an Earthquake. Chernobyl happened in 1986 and ""the official Soviet casualty count of 31 deaths has been disputed,and long term effects such as cancers and deformities are still being accounted for."" To assume that a tsunami or earthquake is likely to be worse shows (to me) that David Measday has a vested interest in Nuclear power of some sort (paid propaganda ?) You would be naive to think otherwise. David Measday 6. “It's bye-bye Japan—and everybody on the west coast of North America should evacuate.” - Suzuki “The Japanese were very careful, they built all their reactors to very high levels. I don't think it would breach... They probably have done as well as you possibly could with their existing reactors. What they failed to do was to estimate the size of the [2011] tsunami. But if there were another tsunami, they still haven't totally prepared for it. They could be in trouble again.” NEWSFLASH!!!! you didnt think!!!! And according to HEADLINES around the world...the Japanese were not careful enough...lets start by saying ....lets build a nuclear reactor on a fault line and see what happens...same as ...lets bury nuclear waste beside 40 million peoples drinking water and see what happens over the next 1000 years... David Measday “I'm sorry, but that is ridiculous. It's totally impossible! I can't believe he would say that. When he's in his own field, he's usually reasonable. But this is just crazy.” This statement comes from a guy that thinks the Japanese have been ""very careful"" I think thats ridiculous considering the state of Japan today and for many years to come. Marcello Pavan “It doesn't in any remote sense seem plausible. It's contaminated material, yes, but certainly not on a scale that would devastate Japan, nor travel all way across the Pacific and cause an evacuation."" Given the proven facts that the solution to pollution is not dilution migrating sea life that is consumed by us westerners have and continue to do so there is more than a remote possibility as this is a prescience and the conclusions will not be determined for many years to come   Your mind seems easily blown, it will be amusing in a few years when nothing has really happened, but i doubt you will take notice, surely there must be some factual youtube videos where you can get some more 'truth' from.  O, and yes, suzuki has been proven a fraud many times, of course conspiracy theory leftists like yourself, people who think themselves intelligent but aren't smart enough to know better, believe in him, that's what makes him successful.   Its been almost 18 years since Chernobyl and i still notice, so its highly likely i will continue to notice this disaster till the day i dont possess my faculties anymore. The word .""Amusing"" is a word you are clearly distorted about. This is not a conspiracy theory its reality...your denial is better suited for the word ""amusing"" and you are incorrect assuming im a lefty or a righty ...i sit right in the middle on any given subject but not the stupidity that puts lives at risk for self serving purposes when there are other safer solutions that are proven. The scientist making the comments in your article you posted from Vice are proud pro nuclear. Why not give them a call and see if they will go to Japan and help with the clean up efforts? and bring their ""super sensitive devices"" with them to get some real facts now that Japan's Government is screaming for world help.  Given the FACT that Chernobyl was a class 7 nuclear disaster and Fuk had 6 reactors 4x7 equates to a class 28 disaster..but hey...what could there possibly be to worry about...your scientists say so"

Unfortunately in todays information age those who speak the loudest often get more creditabitlity whether it's deserved or not.  I don't believe Suzuki is a scam, he's raised a lot of issues on the environmental side that don't get the publicity they need and I think he's done a lot to benefit our environment. I think many in the corporate world would prefer these issues stay under the rug. However at the same time he's much more of a politician than scientist at this point, and sometimes he may propose senarios that are more on the extreme end.  Unfortunately it seems that extreme scenarios are often what it takes to get most of society to take notice on environmental issues. Consider the great lakes, all most people are concerned about our asian carp, we have several threads a year here. However they are many issues facing the lakes today including one that I believe to be the greatest threat of all, that being water sharing and taking agreements (this is a far biggger threat than any carp but few realize it yet)."

817376,big guy,2013-11-08 06:17:00,414,"David Suzuki is a sham, an alarmist, an extremist, as phony as they come. In the 70s he was one of many on the band wagon, convinced another ice age was upon us, now he is on the global warming pulpit. In a recent interview on the talk show Q & A on the Australian Broadcast Corporation, he was questioned about the science behind global warming, the stats the show the earth's warming has actually levelled off over the last 15 years, despite carbon dioxide level increasing exponentially every year. He was unable to answer the questions he was asked and knew nothing of the various world-wide temperature monitors. Many scientists now believe methane levels may be responsible for increased temperatures over the last century. But don't tell Suzuki this, as he does not know the science behind any of it, he is a fraud. I would not believe a word that comes out of his mouth, this is his latest soapbox stunt."

817383,Rich,2013-11-08 11:39:00,3927,"Right. David Suzuki is probably wrong about 3 leaking nuclear reactors. Nothing to worry about, keep your mind on the leafs and the kardashians!"

817404,big guy,2013-11-08 14:35:00,414,"Thanks for the intelligent come back. Don't believe me, look it up, do a search for David Suzuki being in the Q&A show, read about it, read the links associated with the article, educate yourself, just don't rely on the word of a guy who has made a career out of being a warning label.  Btw, not saying the nuclear threat isn't real, just saying that Suzuki always takes the absolute worse case scenario for his stance. Does it seem realistic to evacuate the entire west coast due to a nuclear meltdown in Japan? Given that nuclear fallout could travel northward toward Alaska and get caught up in a polar current just as easy as traveling straight west. Nuclear fallout of that magnitude would affect the entire world eventually, especially the northern hemisphere, so saying that the west coast would need to be evacuated is the extremist point of view he gets people hooked on."
817406,adempsey,2013-11-08 14:41:00,1498,"It's not just David Suzuki saying these things.  It's a very serious issue.  I am not sure I believe it's apocalyptic as some claim, but it appears to be much worse than the Japanese government is leading the world to believe."

Agreed, suzuki is a scam, the Aussie interview was not the first time he's been exposed, but it was the best example.....on a side note, we've worked out at the same gym in dwtn Van, he's a complete dickhead and throws his name around like it means something  Although I don't think anybody can dispute the serious potential of this situation, everybody likes to portray the worst case scenario...media + fear = ratings....suzuki just jumped on the band wagon, something else to boost his fake image, since he's become a liability to his own cause he needs the boost"

You hold a pretty high definition to the word ""sham"" ....   Awards and honours[edit] Suzuki is the recipient of the Order of Canada, first as an Officer (1976), then upgraded to Companion status in (2006),[26] the Order of British Columbia(1995),[27]UNESCO's Kalinga Prize for the Popularization of Science (1986)[28] and a long list of Canadian and international honours. In 2004, Suzuki was nominated as one of the top ten ""Greatest Canadians"" by viewers of the CBC. In the final vote he ranked fifth, making him the greatest living Canadian.[29] Suzuki said that his own vote was for Tommy Douglas who was the eventual winner. In 2006, Suzuki was the recipient of the Bradford Washburn Award presented at the Museum of Science in Boston, Massachusetts.[30] In 2007, Suzuki was honoured by Global Exchange, with the International Human Rights Award. In 2009, Suzuki was awarded the Honorary Right Livelihood Award.[31] As of 2012, Suzuki had received 16 significant academic awards and over 100 other awards.[32] Honorary degrees[edit] Suzuki has received numerous honorary degrees from over two dozen universities around the world.[33]"
