Last year we were drilling holes Dec. 1st but I'm not sure that'll be the case this year.  Being cramped up in a canoe in full winter gear sucks!!! Bring on the ice!"

Winter is forecasted to really grab a hold in January. Env. Can. and other sources are calling for a 'normal' winter, which basically means its gonna be a good one!"
