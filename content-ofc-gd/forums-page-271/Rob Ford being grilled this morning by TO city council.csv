For those of you that commented on what your children will think about the Santa  Clause parade  and how you will have to explain that the mayor is a crack head. If it is your position to make that parade about crack head mayors then that's exactly what it will be about. If your decision is to celebrate Christmas with your children during the parade, and not make the Mayor a focal point, then that's exactly what it will be about.  My children are 17 and 11 yrs. old girls. They still like going to the Santa Claus parade. There is little talk of Ford here (especially after yesterdays cat talk)  but they are smart and social enough.....etc.  At least Rob Ford isn't going to participate this year which takes away that very slight chance  of his influence.or.disruption.  I live a few hundred yards from start of Santa Claus parade (Christie Pits). My main focus, as usual, is not to move my car that day until parade ends. Over a million people attend and parking (even in my spot) is insane for half the day."

You know, act like the other politicians. (Minus the lies, as we all know every politician tells lies)  Ya, that's simple enough.  I understand you don't like ""normal"" politicians. But Ford has gone way over the line. LOFL!!!!!! Priceless.  ""But Ford has gone way over the line"" < That is simple.  Nothing normal about the way politicians are behaving. They are eroding everything from rights and freedoms to the opportunity for us to earn a respectable living so keep hacking away and keep regurgitating everything you've heard.

818575,Propwash,2013-11-15 16:51:00,19," The allegations are nothing more than hearsay, not admissable in court.  They were a result police interviews with ex-staffers, used as a basis to obtain a search warrant.  ie. reasonable grounds to obtain one.  They were not made under oath. Just some clarity on a legal point, the allegations by ex-staffers provided to the police as requested of these individuals as part of an investigation is not hearsay as the staffers were giving their personal accounts of the mayor's activity and not accounts they heard from others. Interviews conducted in assistance of a police investigation are protected under qualified privilege.  These statements were made to an authority, not the media; we found out about them because the record was unsealed by the Court and reported in the media. Thus, any defamation lawsuit against these individuals, as was suggested by Mr. Ford, would have no standing before the Court.  Now, my personal opinion on the politics, as a resident and taxpayer of the City, is that this is a distraction from the issues our government should be engaged in...from crumbling infrastructure, improving our transportation systems, fixing pot-holes, improving our way of life and making investments for future generations.  Our votes and tax money are being spent on nothing more than political jockeying/branding and media outlets selling headlines.  We've lost sight that we elect officials to conduct the business of the city and not perpetually score political points or hide/mislead when things go awry.  We elect and hold elected officials to higher standards than our own, to conduct business bigger than our own; They should conduct themselves accordingly.  The chaos ensuing down at city hall, the passionate arguments here and on the street, conclude that the public trust has been broken.  The unfortunate reality is those that broke it are in charge of fixing it and politics has prevailed over governance.  But it makes for great water cooler talk.  Prop"

818418,Joey,2013-11-14 16:42:00,9122,"Wow, what a thread. Everything I have read so far on this board had me believing that I was becoming a member of this warm heartfelt/lend a hand community and here you are bashing each other for your beliefs and opinions. I have never had a good discussion with anyone regarding politics if their views weren't the same as mine. It seems when politics is the discussion that agreeing to disagree while still respecting the other person is not a possibility as proven by this thread.  I will take a different approach....... YOU ARE ALL RIGHT. Yeah, I know a crazy thought, how can all your differentiating opinions all be correct? Because they are opinions is the answer... you can't tell someone that their feelings aren't correct.  The mayor of ""my city"" has done some really good things while elected. He has exaggerated the savings he brought the taxpayers but the bottom line is there was still some savings overall... I will put that in the plus column. He has also made some extremely poor choices (not unlike many other politicians out there, and no, this is not a get out of jail free quote). It is probably smart for him to get help and to step aside and come back with a vengeance. At the end of the day even his own admissions are only hearsay, they aren't valued in a court of law, but they can be valuable in your own decision. I repeat YOUR OWN DECISION, not the decision that you are entitled to press upon other people, not the decision that you can ridicule someone for their opposing beliefs.  For those of you that feel that using big words (since you're talking about politics) somehow makes you wiser, especially when you typically never speak that way in your other posts really isn't fooling anyone. If your goal was to make your point more relevant I think you have failed, if your goal was to make yourself feel superior and put others down you may have succeeded. For those of you that commented on what your children will think about the Santa Clause parade and how you will have to explain that the mayor is a crack head. If it is your position to make that parade about crack head mayors then that's exactly what it will be about. If your decision is to celebrate Christmas with your children during the parade, and not make the Mayor a focal point, then that's exactly what it will be about.  I know that Rob Ford is no friend of mine, I do not hang around with him, however I would like to get to know a lot of the members on this board and hopefully build some long lasting friendships with people that enjoy the greater things in life (mainly fishing).However, the people I want to associate myself with are not the ones who ridicule others, as far as I am concerned Mayor Ford can seek help and may be a great guy one day, but for those of you that point fingers and feel that your opinions are the only true or correct opinions out there will have a much longer road to recovery than him and you are definitely not the type of person anyone wants to associate with. Although I was not here when the mayor was voted in I do believe at that time I would have voted for him, his actions are not a reflection of me as a person, however the words written here are. Please keep this in mind  I leave you all with this to really think for a moment. Take a look at yourselves. This community built around fishing is a beautiful thing. The knowledge and wisdom that is available here is incredible. We are all individuals, entitled to our own opinions. Lets leave it at that, no more slander, no more talking down to each other. If you want to post an opinion do so. All I ask is that you post your opinion, we will understand if it differs from others beliefs from what you write, therefore the need to cut them down is irrelevant.  I respect all of your opinions, please respect mine!!!!!  Sincerely,  A new member to this forum - RyanSmith   Well Said RyanSmith!"

I'm not so sure that ""if you're doing a good job, do what you want"" has any credibility. If we did a poll on this forum of who felt they were a good performer at their job I'm sure there would be a majority show of hands. If I asked who would get away with Ford's behavior I am relatively positive the number would be close to nil. So why the double standard? In my eyes the argument regarding his ability to govern is semantics. And publicly defending illegal activity and immoral judgement is simply condoning it.

I guess it's ""Do as I say, not as I do""  He is a unique character, that's for sure, I think some of his backers are swooned by the daily soap opera and his resilience  hopefully Karen Stintz gets the job soon, just for the reason that I like looking at her picture in the paper"

With all that said, the events of the last few days have brought me to realize that Robby has to go. I can usually forgive a few indescretions, but Robby has now blown the doors off a few and turned it into a freak show.

818409,pairofgreenhorns,2013-11-14 15:58:00,133,"Wow, what a thread. Everything I have read so far on this board had me believing that I was becoming a member of this warm heartfelt/lend a hand community and here you are bashing each other for your beliefs and opinions. I have never had a good discussion with anyone regarding politics if their views weren't the same as mine. It seems when politics is the discussion that agreeing to disagree while still respecting the other person is not a possibility as proven by this thread.  I will take a different approach....... YOU ARE ALL RIGHT. Yeah, I know a crazy thought, how can all your differentiating opinions all be correct? Because they are opinions is the answer... you can't tell someone that their feelings aren't correct.  The mayor of ""my city"" has done some really good things while elected. He has exaggerated the savings he brought the taxpayers but the bottom line is there was still some savings overall... I will put that in the plus column. He has also made some extremely poor choices (not unlike many other politicians out there, and no, this is not a get out of jail free quote). It is probably smart for him to get help and to step aside and come back with a vengeance. At the end of the day even his own admissions are only hearsay, they aren't valued in a court of law, but they can be valuable in your own decision. I repeat YOUR OWN DECISION, not the decision that you are entitled to press upon other people, not the decision that you can ridicule someone for their opposing beliefs.  For those of you that feel that using big words (since you're talking about politics) somehow makes you wiser, especially when you typically never speak that way in your other posts really isn't fooling anyone. If your goal was to make your point more relevant I think you have failed, if your goal was to make yourself feel superior and put others down you may have succeeded. For those of you that commented on what your children will think about the Santa Clause parade and how you will have to explain that the mayor is a crack head. If it is your position to make that parade about crack head mayors then that's exactly what it will be about. If your decision is to celebrate Christmas with your children during the parade, and not make the Mayor a focal point, then that's exactly what it will be about.  I know that Rob Ford is no friend of mine, I do not hang around with him, however I would like to get to know a lot of the members on this board and hopefully build some long lasting friendships with people that enjoy the greater things in life (mainly fishing).However, the people I want to associate myself with are not the ones who ridicule others, as far as I am concerned Mayor Ford can seek help and may be a great guy one day, but for those of you that point fingers and feel that your opinions are the only true or correct opinions out there will have a much longer road to recovery than him and you are definitely not the type of person anyone wants to associate with. Although I was not here when the mayor was voted in I do believe at that time I would have voted for him, his actions are not a reflection of me as a person, however the words written here are. Please keep this in mind  I leave you all with this to really think for a moment. Take a look at yourselves. This community built around fishing is a beautiful thing. The knowledge and wisdom that is available here is incredible. We are all individuals, entitled to our own opinions. Lets leave it at that, no more slander, no more talking down to each other. If you want to post an opinion do so. All I ask is that you post your opinion, we will understand if it differs from others beliefs from what you write, therefore the need to cut them down is irrelevant.  I respect all of your opinions, please respect mine!!!!!  Sincerely,  A new member to this forum - RyanSmith"

This mayor puts a big black mark on this occasion. ....I'll have to say to my kids .' there is Rudolph, there is Santa, there is our crack smoking mayor who is currently  being in a murder investigation""   ""Be very careful what you write""  Ford sums up today.  I am concerned how an admitted crack user etc.... will affect my children's perception of the  Santa Claus parade this year when he goes by my area. It will become about him and not the enjoyment of the season for children here.  Polls tonight show that 75 % of Toronto taxpayers want him to resign.

Somebody that needs to take some time off to recoup. Drugs whatever it's his personal life and yes if in trouble should be charged or in jain. Rumours and a fat stack of people that swear hes up to no good are all that are against him.  The news is the government waste more money than all of you think and there is nothing anybody will do to stop it. Rob Ford is the only politician that has caught my eye in my short life for trying to do the good for the people by taking our money and doing good with it. Put him in jail or let him do his job, how dare those crooks tell him to leave when none of them were fit to be the mayor in the first place."

I am trying to tell you folks that as a taxpayer resident of Toronto, ford  has lied us taxpayers., admitting he smokes crack and more than can be listed. I am living here experiecing it as a taxxpyer he has done nothing but but make criminality seem acceptable  to children.   'Nuff said..... I am a resident, taxpayer he lied to us."
818344,MCTFisher9120,2013-11-14 01:57:00,3761,I wasted 5 minutes of my day today thinking about politics and Rob Ford..that I'll never get back

If a vote were to be taken today and I could vote he would be getting mine. I wish we had a guy like him here. We wouldn't be in this mess with the land dispute in Caledonia with the First Nation folks, or the wind turbines being pushed down our throats without any say.  I couldn't say that about him after this circus all started in May, I had based an opinion of him without knowing what the guy was all about. As I'm sure many have."

Hookers at city hall, doing oxycontin, drinking and driving, smoking crack, hanging around known GUNS AND DRUG dealers, purchasing drugs on city time, lying to the public about it all, using his drug dealer pal to extort the individuals with the video, condemning harm reduction and drug addicts - the hypocrisy is incredible. Why does he get your support for a ""mistake"" when anyone else engaging in these activities would not. The whole thing is absurd."

They are going to have to kill the guy before he quits. No one can argue what he has done is not absolutely discussing, but he does his job, and well.

He has no bering where I live,but I have to say in the half dozen companies I have been to in the last 8days,bottom line,they want him to get help,but if he's there next year to vote,they will have him again.I'd have to say close to 100% of the people that voted for him last time still will.Now this is in a reatively 30-80 employee plants.But the talk is the same. It's a lot of the outsiders adding there 2cents,when it really has no effect on there city/towns.That's why I say ""we'll see"".Toronto is a different bird."

I like my neighbors in Toronto here. If he was my neighbor i would be scared for my children's safety. The Santa Claus parade starts about 300 yards from my home this weekend. Always one of the coolest things living so close. This mayor puts a big black mark on this occasion. ....I'll have to say to my kids .' there is Rudolph, there is Santa, there is our crack smoking mayor who is currently  being in a murder investigation""   All this just for saving me as a taxpayer 60 dollars on a car tax. Otherwise all my taxes, property , etc... are the same. As a resident i have saved little on tax but have explain to my kids, crack and murder because of it, probably during Santa Claus parade by my house."

That's the same consideration  Robs opponents afforded his supporters and that's the same moronic,socialistic thinking that will lead us to a different kind of self destruction I'm afraid. There is one inherent difference between Rob and those that would like to see him and others like him disappear.  Rob might have a substance  and/or alcohol abuse problem and with the proper support in place could deal with and possibly overcome it as I and many others hope.  The rest of them have something that is far worse an impediment than anything Toronto's Mayor will have to deal with and that is ""Entitlement"". Its' a horrible affliction that the Un-Stupid have and up to this point there is no known cure for it. Just kindergarten kids whining and stomping their feet cause someone finally took their milk, cookies and nap mats away. GO ROB GO!!!!!!!!!"
