818999,Roy,2013-11-18 12:22:00,13728,Very nice Simon. A winter wonderland in your back yard. Enjoy!
819001,DanD,2013-11-18 12:44:00,2223,Great pictures they look B&W with hints of colour; the one of the dog especially. Only in Canada EH; I went to the drive-in theater Saturday night in the 50 Chev; it was more like May then November. As nice as those pictures are you can keep all that snow. LOL  Dan.
819004,dave524,2013-11-18 13:49:00,4508,"Keep it, that is more snow than we have got in any of the last five years since I've retired and bought a snowblower. One winter never even used it and that don't bother me.  If I do venture out it is for the open water of the Niagara River for the next few months."
819006,NAW,2013-11-18 14:02:00,4022,Break out the snow shoes!
819010,Ron,2013-11-18 14:51:00,1683,"One of my favorite times to take photos, just after a big snow storm."
819014,Rod Caster,2013-11-18 14:58:00,5784,"So, did you cast it off in our direction?"
819017,manitoubass2,2013-11-18 16:04:00,11391,"Nope, he cast it in my direction lol. Been plowing since last night"
819020,Rattletrap2,2013-11-18 16:34:00,1652,"Very nice Simon, but please keep it up there for a bit longer. I am no where near ready for that yet! In fact, I don't know if I'm ever going to be ready for it! lol"
819028,fishnsled,2013-11-18 18:06:00,3520,"Very nice Simon, but please keep it up there for a bit longer. I am no where near ready for that yet! In fact, I don't know if I'm ever going to be ready for it! lol  X2.  I have a couple more boating trips planned that I'm hoping to get in.  Mind you, ripping around on the sled is a lot of fun as well."
819033,DRIFTER_016,2013-11-18 18:39:00,10439,"Send it my way!!!! We have ice now, but no snow to get there on. Trailering sucks when you can usually just ride from your door."
819036,Jds63,2013-11-18 19:00:00,1365,very nice .... send it this way we gotta have it for Christmas ...

819038,Handlebarz,2013-11-18 19:06:00,3790,I cut the grass yesterday I was nice enough to take a video to send to my brother in northern Saskatchewan. He is going to make me one with his snowblower lol
