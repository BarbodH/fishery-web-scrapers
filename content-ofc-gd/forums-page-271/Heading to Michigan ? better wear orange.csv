818554,kickingfrog,2013-11-15 14:51:00,8333,"Wow, that is a lot of hunters in a much smaller area then here. I wonder how many hunt the UP?"
818555,TJQ,2013-11-15 14:54:00,7806,LOL.. Alot....  its a big deal down there.....  and the UP is a slice of Canada......
818564,leaf4,2013-11-15 16:06:00,2466,"that is a huge population of deer being harvested in that area wow, I wonder how sustainable a hunt that size every year is"
818568,Thrilla,2013-11-15 16:21:00,164,"The deer are very overpopulated there, drive down I75 this time of and you cant  go 2 miles without seeing one on the side of the road."
818571,misfish,2013-11-15 16:33:00,29133,"Yea,but they are real small deer."
818574,lew,2013-11-15 16:43:00,12766,"Yea,but they are real small deer.  With 650,000 guys blasting guns at them, they don't have a chance to become adults."
818576,Thrilla,2013-11-15 16:56:00,164,"Yes they are, because they are overpopulated they cant grow to there potential... Competing for food, disease... ect.  Yea,but they are real small deer."

Not sure if this is true, or if he was telling a little white lie.  I do know you can buy sacks and grain and apples at the gas stations!  It's pretty much true. I think a lot of businesses just shut down since it opens on a weekday. My Dad is from Pennsylvania and the schools shut down for the first 2 days of rifle season and probably do in a lot of areas of MI also. Here in Indiana we get the guns out tomorrow. I've been hunting since September 15th though with crossbow."

818589,T-Bone,2013-11-15 17:38:00,160," With 650,000 guys blasting guns at them, they don't have a chance to become adults.  Yea,but they are real small deer.  There is an arm of my family that has a private hunting lodge and cabins on about 3,500 acres nearer the top of the lower peninsula. Every year, 90% of the hunters get a buck, with an 8-point minimum to take a shot (self-imposed) and usually a couple 12+ brutes in the mix.  Not sure where you're getting your info Misfish, but there's no shortage of big deer in Michigan. With that many hunters (80% of them novice or slightly better), the deer have learned through the generations how to stay out of the crosshairs better than you think and grow to be of enviable size in any area of North America.  And it's not an actual holiday, but schools are closed and most non-hunting / non-tourism business owners and employees are out hunting."

Looks like they are weighing and measuring them.  Likely giving out prizes for the biggest deer.  The same thing happens in Ontario at some hunt shops for Turkeys.  Not sure about the deer hunt.  That would be cool to go see though!   Edit.. I just looked at the contest winners on that website. http://www.knutsonbuckpole.com/2012%20pages/2012DeerContestWinners.html  Biggest deer last year was 228 LBS 8 point.  That's a decent sized deer!  I think the Ontario record for a whitetail is just under 300lbs.  Don;t quote me.

818725,outllaw,2013-11-16 12:14:00,1232,"I have hunted Michigan for deer. they do make it an event. there not shy about hunting heritage. one thing I do know. after the first shots are fired.you better be prepared to swamp hunt,if you want a decent buck... these nothing like eating corn fed deer chops lol."
