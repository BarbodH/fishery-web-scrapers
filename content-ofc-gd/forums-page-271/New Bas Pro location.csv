818235,the spirit of fishing,2013-11-13 18:00:00,141,I just read this in the paper. New store for the Ottawa area announced. http://www.ottawacitizen.com/business/Bass+Shops+coming+Ottawa/9160592/story.html
818247,BassMan11,2013-11-13 19:33:00,583,"Great news for us here in Ottawa, BPS, Sail, and Lebaron all within 25 minutes of each other... plus construction traffic that is."
818370,Moosebunk,2013-11-14 03:55:00,3970,"Who doesn't like options?  Cause a BPS in Ottawa will bring just a little more of that in their big kinda way.  25 minutes down the road too, instead of 4 hours to Vaughn."
818379,Richie Razor,2013-11-14 05:59:00,536,"Great location, it should do very well. IMO what bps does so well is they promote a culture that fisherman and hunters feel very comfortable in, as well as add a level of nostalgia in each location that every outdoorsman will fall in love with. They spend a ton on store fixtures and displays creating this unique atmosphere, it's no wonder customer service reviews have always been lacking... You simply can't have it all I guess. It'll be a great addition to the area"

I know its a ""touristy"" area, but didn't think the area would be the best choice for one of their stores. Of course the one on Universal Drive in Florida is kinda the same thing and seems to do well. I guess this is why they don't bother to consult me for my opinion on new locations! lol"

The biggest tourist attraction in all of Missouri is the Springfield, Missouri Bass Pro Shop. Even the Ottawa press release talks about traffic and tourist attractions in the Ottawa area."

818475,kickingfrog,2013-11-14 22:39:00,8333,They're still waiting for someone to show them somthin'â€¦ anything.
818484,Rich,2013-11-14 23:38:00,3927,"Hey, Springfield BPS is tops, Vaughan is nothing in comparison.. thats all Missouri needs in my books! Lol"
818486,aplumma,2013-11-14 23:39:00,6896,I get more requests to go to the Bass Pro shop than to go to the air and space museum from visiting guests.   Art
