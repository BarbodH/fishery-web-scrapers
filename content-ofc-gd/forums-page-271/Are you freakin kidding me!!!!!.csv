Never say your packed and ready for ice fishing, or its almost a sure thing youll be waiting another 6 weeks. What you should say is the opposite, boats packed, time to hit soft water! Lol. I just remembered one for the superstition thread"
818303,kickingfrog,2013-11-13 22:57:00,8333,Around here it is forecast to be 13 and rainy on Saturday. Given the last 20 years we're at least a month away from real winter.
