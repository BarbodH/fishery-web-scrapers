Mr. 10 and Mr. 9 are the main stars of the show, but long and skinny Mr. 8 also makes an appearance.  Has been a fun first week documenting the rut with the camera.  For best viewing, please watch in 1080p HD (circular icon at bottom right under viewing screen).  Enjoy...   "

818747,farsider,2013-11-16 16:23:00,456,"I am wondering if this is more of the latter parts-of-the-rut or post-rut.  You have captured alot of them bedded down and chewing their cud.  Some Bucks will literally run themself to death during the rut.  Tending Does and chasing off other suitors becomes all-consuming with few breaks for food, if any.  Maybe it is a peculiarity of the density and zero legal hunting pressure in your suburban area.  What would be cool for you is if they stick around until they shed their antlers and you have a chance of holding the antlers of Bucks you have encountered and videoed/photographed throughout the year.  Fingers crossed.  Cheers, Mark"
818770,JustinHoffman,2013-11-16 21:21:00,482,"Hi Mark,  Thanks for your comments. I don't believe it is post-rut. I have been searching these same areas for the last month. Although in that time I have found many scrapes and rubs, I had yet to see a buck until this week. They are now visible throughout the day, and in numbers. I have seen sporadic chasing down of does (last night in particular) but not the all out chases I am used to seeing last year. Also, other than one small scrap, these bucks seem to be tolerating each other, at least the day I found four together. Strangely enough, yesterday I only found the biggest buck in each of my two areas, so perhaps he has chased the others off.I am finding many of the bucks tight to does - either bedded down close to one or near the vicinity. I checked back at my notes and images from last year - the full-out chases and scraps occurred over the next two weeks, meaning the last two weeks of this month. My best action last year was November 28th. All of the bucks I am currently filming and photographing are actively making scrapes, rubs and scenting does along the trails. My guess is this coming week will be full on. As for finding sheds of deer I have followed, it has happened. Photographed a small five pointer last year one evening. The next morning I found both of his sheds (inches apart) on a main trail. A couple hundred yards away I found the buck - with the still fresh blood from where they dropped. I also have found a gnarly rack of a buck I had watched last year, as well as one other.The big 10-point buck in this video is one I spent many days photographing last year. He is in a new spot this season, about a km east and across a busy road. My goal is to find a shed of his  Will keep you updated how the coming weeks go...  Cheers, Justin"

818773,JustinHoffman,2013-11-16 21:37:00,482,"Hey Brian,  I have a new stock portfolio website that I upload my images to. It has easy to use categories/species, and my most recent shoots can be found under the ""Recent Photos"" folder in the drop down menu. This site was mainly designed for art directors, but is the best way to see my images and work. I will be uploading yesterdays shoot tomorrow when I am back in town. Had an awesome shoot with Mr. 10.  Feel free to check it out if you are interested. All sorts of deer, turkey, grouse, moose, and fox porn to drool over....  www.JustinHoffmanOutdoors.zenfolio.com  Cheers, Justin"

818778,JustinHoffman,2013-11-16 22:27:00,482,"Thanks, Brian - appreciate the kind words. The spruce grouse were shot in Algonquin Park approx. a month or so ago. Took me a full year to finally cross paths with them. Beautiful birds to say the least...  Cheers, Justin"
