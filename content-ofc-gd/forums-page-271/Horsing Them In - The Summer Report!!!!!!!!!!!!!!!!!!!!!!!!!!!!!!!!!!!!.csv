818366,Moosebunk,2013-11-14 03:47:00,3970,"Day in the boat you pulled out that mask you were grinning and laughing like a little kid.  Must admit, for a mostly quiet and polite fella you've got an odd funny bone Mikey that keeps things interesting.  Nobody I know throws the line ""gotta a joke for ya"" more than you do, but on week long trips and full day car rides, they're always welcome.  Looks like you got a few people freaked out around here.  For those who don't know, Mike's online fishing reports for a good few years now have always ""wow'd"" members elsewhere.  A new house and plenty work slowing him a little these days, when he's out searching for back-lake trout in Eastern Ontario, there are few to none who catch'em and photograph 'em as good... nor often share with such wit.  Not enough horseplay here though dood.  The mask is awesomely intense and it hides that Roland head, keep it on awhile longer!        "
818399,SirCranksalot,2013-11-14 13:41:00,3291,"Oh, I don't think there were any serious neigh sayers re the OPS report. Just guys kidding about the off-the wall sense of humor."
818421,Whitespinnerbait,2013-11-14 17:07:00,2038,Hee Haw ! Hee Haw !
818448,Headhunter,2013-11-14 20:54:00,5703,It looks like you scared that Whitie! Thanks for the many laughs! HH
818451,kuhaman,2013-11-14 20:57:00,503,Awesome report!
818489,Rod Caster,2013-11-14 23:57:00,5784,"I first read this report from my phone, I really squinted and studied your first photo, then burst out laughing when I realized what I was seeing...it only got better hahaha.  Great fish too! Good entertainment all around"
818008,S.M.05,2013-11-12 02:14:00,145,"I have been wanting to put up a few reports this year but have been just too darn busy with work and the farm.  Although I have been busy working like an animal to support the new farm I did manage to get out for 3-4hrs the odd evening and horse a few fish in. I even got to join a favorite fishn bud for trip up north.          So with out further ado here is how my summer started straight from the horses mouth!   After a long couple weeks of work I was really chomping at the bit to get into some fish and decided to saddle up for a little back woods walleye. Grabbed my trusty ol fishn pole, a sardine can full of worms and headed up to Dunworkin Lake for the night bite.          The evening bite on this lake can be hot on the right night and this night....... it was on fire.    Tasty walleye after tasty walleye were horsed into the boat with a couple smaller ones kept for a snack.    Best of the night was this big old golden stallion.     I tell ya after catching all those walleye I was hungry as a horse. Back at the farm I decided to grill me up a steak and do up some fresh walleye in Cajun mix for a little extra kick!     Hold on to your horses! Before I tell you about the rest of my summer here's a funny one I love telling the boys.  So I met this lady the other night at the bar and after bringing her home and showing her a couple of photos........ she had to admit that I was half man half horse!  Alright! Alright! Enough horsing around, back to the report.     Since moving out to the farm last year I have been taking advantage of waters closer to home. This allowed me a few hours of horsing them in during the odd evening.  Like some big mouth bass.     The odd night after a game of horse shoes I would switch over to a game of craps.     It just wouldn't be summer with out at least one quick trip for trout. I decided on bows and portaged the old tinny down the trail into sleeping bear lake.     Fishing was slower than usual but I did manage to horse in this girl.     What better way to end the summer than with my bud the Moose on a long awaited fishing trip up north.             Time to giddy up and get ready for the ice season OFC'ers"
818009,leaf4,2013-11-12 02:18:00,2466,"amazing report pictures hahahaha that was definitely good for a laugh, sweet catches!"
818014,NAW,2013-11-12 02:40:00,4022,Nice summer for sure!  You got out way more than I have.  Gotta ask though...  What's with the mask.  Good for a chuckle.  But am I missing something?
818020,Joey,2013-11-12 03:11:00,9122,"Do you actually carry that mask around with you and put it on every time  you catch a fish?  Bizarre, yet funny, in a weird kind of way.  Thanks for the laugh!"
818021,limeyangler,2013-11-12 03:14:00,5204,Nice fishâ€¦..lol.
818022,S.M.05,2013-11-12 03:15:00,145,N.A.W Glad you got a chuckle as that the point of the whole report.

818024,Joeytier,2013-11-12 03:21:00,3990,Thats a lotta horseplay for one summer.  Looks like the farms been treatin ya well.  Sweet report
818025,irishfield,2013-11-12 03:21:00,26272,  I'm sure the CO would as he pulled up...  .. great fish none the less... this place could use a bit of horsing around and laughs!
818026,S.M.05,2013-11-12 03:21:00,145,"Do you actually carry that mask around with you and put it on every time  you catch a fish?  Bizarre, yet funny, in a weird kind of way.  Thanks for the laugh!  Just this year in order to build this report. Best was catching the guy peering around the corner of his cottage while I was taking pics of the bass. Im sure he had a second look at the drink in his hand. lol"
818027,Cast-Away,2013-11-12 03:32:00,790,I thought that it was going to be a happy report with all of the !!!!!!! But why the long face?????
818029,BillM,2013-11-12 04:04:00,17367,The horse face is hilarious lol!!!
818031,solopaddler,2013-11-12 04:32:00,8605,The horse face is hilarious lol!!!  What horse face?
818032,Old Ironmaker,2013-11-12 04:37:00,8243,"Horse walks into a bar, bartender says "" Why the long face? ""  I think you better put an extension on the exhaust on your tractor, someone is suffering from the effects of Carbon Monoxide poisoning. Or maybe you pull the plow yourself.  As far as the report nice fish, but I agree it's something about it that is very, very disturbing. Humor is sometimes an acquired taste, of which I apparently have none."
818047,Rich,2013-11-12 11:09:00,3927,"Omg this fits so well into an inside joke at work, I cant wait to show my boss this report! Lmao"
