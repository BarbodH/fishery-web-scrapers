818062,BillM,2013-11-12 14:47:00,17367,Love me some lakers!
818077,chris.brock,2013-11-12 16:48:00,4053,"lakers or splake?  definitely nice country up there, looks like more fun to me rather than fishing shoulder to shoulder down here  I'm guessing the ponds might get a skim of ice in the next couple days up there  PM me if you're ever looking for company to hit some back lakes"
818095,Joeytier,2013-11-12 20:09:00,3990,The yr-round lakers and splakers have been chompin' last week or two!  Once this cold snap lets go there should be another good week of action coming up before the big lockup!
