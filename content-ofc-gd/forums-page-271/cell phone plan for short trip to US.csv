818305,bassfighter,2013-11-13 23:02:00,366,"I am semi-old school, brings my laptop to US all the time, Free wifi, I use free google phone and yap away for no cost, or use skype for international calls . Many places have free wifi, strarbucks, panera bread, mcdonald, malls, all Hotel or motel have free wifi, just park outside, and browse away for free. I also check for cross border busyness and decide last minute which border I will be crossing back to canada, to not have to line up way too long, especially avoiding lewiston bridge.  I am with wind or mobilicity here in GTA, cost 10-15 cents to text from US, and 20 cents for calling within US, no need to change plans. For other less important calls, I go back to using my laptop. I pay $20 with wind and they provide $5 credit every month for first 10 months, which I used for texting outside my zone, including using in US.  I was in Buffalo and bought a PC tablet from walmart US last week for $80, 7"" size, tried and tested it, work very fast for wifi browsing and youtube images downloaded very clear and no freezing, but too complicated for emailing,or sending uploading my fishing picture, forced to use different cables, different emailing applications compared to my traditional laptop computers. It took me a while to familiarize with some apps, and getting used to typing on the touch screen. It's smart apps remembers new email and automatically compiled them and showed my what are new unread email, but someone who wants to use the tablet and check their email also need to register with googlel. After two hours of playing with it,  I returned  the PC Tablet back to Walmart Buffalo, best happy decision I made!"

817242,musky_hunter,2013-11-07 16:30:00,328,buy a travel plan from your carrier.
817243,kickingfrog,2013-11-07 16:33:00,8333,That straight forward and easy eh. Good to know.
817245,John Bacon,2013-11-07 16:41:00,3277,I think the default for Rogers is ~$7 / day for roaming.  I am not sure about other carriers.
817246,bare foot wader,2013-11-07 16:50:00,1354,"even with the largest travel package I bought from telus, my 7 day bill was disgusting...  I'm not sure where I missed the ""fine print"", but I got royally effed somehow....the plan I bought by calling telus was highly misleading, the way they explained the charges was not how I was billed, and it was a losing battle arguing after the fact...I'd suggest going into your providers store and going through the plan details very carefully with somebody"
817255,aplumma,2013-11-07 17:47:00,6896,Might want to check into a disposable phone available here in the States and just leave a message on your phone with the temp number. More complicated would be to see if you can forward your phone to the new one. I usually leave a message on my phone saying I am unavailable and to email me or skye and use a tablet on WI FI to get messages.   Art

817272,grimsbylander,2013-11-07 18:36:00,3016,"I've bought travel packages for both Rogers and Telus. I find it dead easy. They have set packages for varying costs depending on your needs. You just pick the one that suits your usage by # of minutes, # of texts and data amount(# of MB). I travel to the US on business and always take my personal cell as well."

817411,Old Ironmaker,2013-11-08 15:16:00,8243,"I was away last month and bought the roam package through my provider KOODO. It was $80.00 for 40 minutes, that's not cheap. Never again but it was a last minute thing.  Easy to say shut off the phone, not easy to do. What did we do 20 years ago, oh yea pay phone will Bell card."
817420,kickingfrog,2013-11-08 15:56:00,8333,Ya it's the mapping for exploring (i've got a long list of highlights) and the texting for meeting friends that I'd like to have if I need/want itâ€¦ and not pay through the nose.
817573,singingdog,2013-11-09 10:38:00,1047,Last time we went down we went to buy a SIM card for the phone. Ends up it was cheaper to buy a phone ($15) and do a pay-as-you-go plan.

817694,danc,2013-11-10 02:04:00,4677,I spent a week in the US a month ago and I just shut off my data. I used my phone and text at will and my bill was barely above normal. It's that easy.
817697,crappieperchhunter,2013-11-10 02:11:00,2582,When I read stuff like this I'm just glad I have never entered the cell phone market.  No offense intended...just glad it's something I don't have to lose sleep over.
817710,BillM,2013-11-10 02:53:00,17367,How are your carrier pigeons doing?
817714,crappieperchhunter,2013-11-10 03:24:00,2582,LOL   Thanx for that Bill. I got a good chuckle out of that. I know. I know. I always said if I had a job that required people to be able to contact me 24/7 I would have had a cell years ago. Still don't have that job though....and am thankful for it
817758,BillM,2013-11-10 17:21:00,17367,"I thought you would like that one, lol!!!"
817765,kickingfrog,2013-11-10 18:16:00,8333,How are your carrier pigeons doing?  They can't lift the stone tablets.
817775,crappieperchhunter,2013-11-10 20:35:00,2582, They can't lift the stone tablets. My pigeons are union members and under contract are not allowed to carry my old stone tablets so I had to switch to papyrus paper a few millennium ago  Good luck with your new fangled cell phone package thingy for your trip stateside.
