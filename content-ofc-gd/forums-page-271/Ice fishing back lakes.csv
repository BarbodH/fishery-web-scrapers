I have done some looking around on google maps and found some lakes. How do you guys find info on these smaller lakes..like topographic maps, species and condition. I've looked on google for info in 5 different lakes and haven't come across any info on any if them."
818546,wallacio,2013-11-15 13:09:00,475,An interactive map with fish species and stocking if applicable.  http://www.web2.mnr.gov.on.ca/fish_online/fishing/fishingExplorer_en.html  You can also check stocking lists for the area:  http://www.muskokawaterweb.ca/lake-data/mnr-data/fish-stocking  http://www.hhoa.on.ca/fish-stocking.html
818548,NAW,2013-11-15 13:26:00,4022,"Ya.  what he said^^  I look at the smallest lakes, with the highest stocking.  If they are near a snowmobile trail - bonus!"
818549,Christopheraaron,2013-11-15 14:02:00,3525,They should all be on fish on line since to my knowledge all the year round lakes are stocked.
818561,chris.brock,2013-11-15 15:32:00,4053,"typically, the more difficult it is to access the lake, the better the fishing"
818572,4x4bassin,2013-11-15 16:35:00,1025,"typically, the more difficult it is to access the lake, the better the fishing  Agree 100% , do some research and get out there and explore for those hidden gems ."
818618,Joeytier,2013-11-15 20:09:00,3990,Get to know the area via the stocked easier access lakes and go from there.
818655,shimano19,2013-11-15 23:29:00,196,thanks guys! very helpful
818658,misfish,2013-11-15 23:55:00,29133," If they are near a snowmobile trail - bonus!  Shame shame. Snow shoe in Nick. Lazy bugger you.LOL  All the flipp.n I have done this year,snow shoe,n in,is going to be a breeze."
818663,NAW,2013-11-16 00:17:00,4022,My bravo has a steel bumper on it!  Great for smashing my way in to back lakes!  But yes.  You're right.  Much more authentic feel when you stap on the snowshoes and hike in!
818705,Rich,2013-11-16 03:09:00,3927,This.. this is amazing. I can't believe I didn't know about this.
818739,Marko,2013-11-16 15:18:00,854,"This.. this is amazing. I can't believe I didn't know about this.  That was my exact expression when i first found out about the list last year on another board.  With the backwood lakes...further away from the road the better. The good ones you usually cant drive to. Look for drop offs....rocks they can ""suntan"" on....trees in the water. Panther Martins tipped with worms or minnows are my go to baits"

818796,dhickey,2013-11-17 00:39:00,1038,The best advice is be extremely cautious when exploring a back lake. Its not like fishing a big lake with huts and people every where. Things can and do go bad in a hart beat on a back lake.(trust me) You should know the lake or at least know someone that knows it. A underground spring /underwater currents or faulty equipment can spell disaster. Faster than you can say OHH CRAP.  Good luck.
818815,Joeytier,2013-11-17 01:51:00,3990,Good call on the spring comment.  Ive walked past open water in mid february after a week of -35's on some smaller lakes with heavy spring activity.
