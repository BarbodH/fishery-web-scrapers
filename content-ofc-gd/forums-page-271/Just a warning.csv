818899,leaf4,2013-11-17 17:40:00,2466,"lol download AVG from download.com and do a scan, that site also has tons of other programs for malware removal, also registry cleaners they help big time for computer speed and restoring it by getting rid of extra files on the computer that are null due to the parent program being deleted etc cleans up partial files and corrupted files"
818901,lookinforwalleye,2013-11-17 17:44:00,4399,Doing a full scan with AVG now...

My apologies if it was link i posted. Have been using that link for a few years now on recommendation on this site. Even use it for baseball and  hockey that isn't televised.as well.  I use Google Chrome and free AVAST!  spyware and have never had spyware...."
818945,Burtess,2013-11-17 22:36:00,901,I used that link and haven't had any problems...... did you click on any pop ups that came up during the fight?  What anti-virus are you using?  Burt
818948,lookinforwalleye,2013-11-17 23:24:00,4399,I use avast and it caught some viruses but something got through. No worries lesson learned.
818981,Nipfisher,2013-11-18 03:01:00,2449,Never had a problem with the link I posted. www.firstrowsports.eu
818984,lookinforwalleye,2013-11-18 03:12:00,4399,Probably something I did...perhaps I hit one of those pop up by mistake. But the fact that the sites are full of malware and Trojans is enough for me to stay away in the future.
818986,danc,2013-11-18 03:31:00,4677,Theres lots of programs out there to prevent such things. I never have an issue with on line programming.
