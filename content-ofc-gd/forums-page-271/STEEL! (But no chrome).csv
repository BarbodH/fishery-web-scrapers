818640,Rich,2013-11-15 21:49:00,3927,"Biggest McBow of the season so far for me, smashed the bottom bounced bow skein and almost took my rod in with him! Close quarters battle with a big (for me) bow, cant beat it!  "
818644,Christopheraaron,2013-11-15 22:01:00,3525,"Id say that's a good bow for anyone, congrats!"
818712,Crooked Rapids,2013-11-16 05:24:00,1,Very nice!!...which river?
818718,Rich,2013-11-16 09:36:00,3927,"It was an Erie trib.  There's only four around me that are open, and this one is the slowest and most pressured, so I won't name it.. but it's not hard to figure out."
818720,davey buoy,2013-11-16 10:51:00,5505,"Nothing wrong with that,nice going!!!"
818721,misfish,2013-11-16 11:10:00,29133,"Nice fish Rich.Grats  Just getting ready to head out for some ""blast &cast"". Weathers been stable,so Im thinking the bite should be good."
818743,esoxansteel,2013-11-16 15:52:00,1307,"Close quarter steelhead are fun, when theres wood to contend with, nice fish"
818849,FISHEYEZ,2013-11-17 05:38:00,49,Nice brute!!
818858,Fish Farmer,2013-11-17 09:10:00,2234,"Way to go Rich, Congrats  , Tell me, you used a spinning reel to catch that fish, not one of those CLOTHE- line- reel thingies to reel her in.  OK Steelers, I'll go and stick my head"
818870,Rich,2013-11-17 12:35:00,3927,"Well yes Fish Farmer , I float fished for 4 hours with that fancy pin I got, not a bite. The spinning gear never lets me down!  But catching that fish on my pin would have been 10x the experience, just sayin"
818872,BillM,2013-11-17 13:15:00,17367,They even cut the grass for you there Rich!   That's pretty sweet     Nice buck.
