817656,cowanjo,2013-11-09 22:41:00,249,"Very strange day not another boat out there, Water temp 44.6 - getting close to freezing - saw a couple of nice musky but no takers. Will chase again tomorrow. Anyone with any thoughts PM me - north End.  Found totally green cabbage which was really odd as well given water temp  Anyone else out tomorrow let me know we can work together."
817659,fishindevil,2013-11-09 22:45:00,6254,Were you guys in a 14-16ft  tinny and fishing right where nogies creek flows into pigeon ??? If so I seen you guys out there !!! Casting for muskies ?? No boats on sturgeon lake today that I seen either !!!!
817660,lew,2013-11-09 22:51:00,12766,Anyone with any thoughts PM me - north End.  This time of year I like big weighted twitch baits worked slowly John.  Slow cranked Jakes and Believers  are also good in cold water.  This is assuming your casting.
817662,Raf,2013-11-09 22:55:00,3495,(literally) scratching bottom with deep divers in 18'-22' has worked well for me when the water's in the 40s out there. if you're trolling..
817663,Rizzo,2013-11-09 23:16:00,4754,ditto what raf said. Once the water is in the 40's troll something that dives 20 feet in 19 to 21 feet of water! Get a good long leader so you don't fray your line especially if there any zebra mussels up there. If you are marking fish in deeper water (say 30 feet) I use a big storm jig while my buddy uses a bondy
817667,cowanjo,2013-11-09 23:37:00,249,"Thanks guys - i was casting - never made it to noggies, taits bay - saw a couple of nice ones but will definetly take the advice with greg tomorrow. I throw a twitch bait for sure - John"
817668,lew,2013-11-09 23:42:00,12766,"I throw a twitch bait for sure - John  A bait that's neutral buoyant works really well this time of year John.  A few long slow twitches then let it just hang for a few seconds, then start twitching again. They'll normally hit right after the pause."
817669,ehg,2013-11-09 23:49:00,2666,"Had a place around there for nearly 20 yrs. and fished it till closing or ice. Found slow trolling 8 -10 inch perch or walleye finish Jakes or Believers over the 40 - 55 ft. depths produced. When a little shallower 20 - 30 ft. the Perch Super Shad Rap worked well.  The musky are hanging around trying to pick off the little walleye, perch that go into that deepest water at this time of year. Dress warm, have a thermos of coffee and troll."
817687,cowanjo,2013-11-10 01:44:00,249,"Thanks I know the 55 and the reefs - not many spots like that in pigeon north end , not really a troller but will give it a go. Lew I assume your talking suicks,hose or phantom.  I had the heater and coffee today - they really were alergic to rubber today. we will also try some jigging again out from the reefs rights on the bottom, I know craig has had some sucess with that pattern"
817703,Gregoire,2013-11-10 02:33:00,1397,Whatever you are doing tomorrow I'm going to do the complete opposite...maybe I'll try burning blades.
817705,mikethepike,2013-11-10 02:36:00,3,"does anybody know where to buy big dardevle/5 of diamonds spoons 5"" or bigger?"
817706,Gregoire,2013-11-10 02:36:00,1397,I have one...where are you located?
817707,mikethepike,2013-11-10 02:41:00,3,pm sent
817709,cowanjo,2013-11-10 02:48:00,249,maybe you will bring your pirate ship from escanaba - maybe it will be warmer for you when i cover you in spray. I am sure you will no doubt get lucky throwing a double ten again in november  see you tomorrow greg
817724,Handlebarz,2013-11-10 10:56:00,3790,John if the normal stuff for this time of year is not working then switch it up and go blades just roll them slow BIG AND SLOW is the way to GO. or burn the hell out of them LOL  Good luck today
817781,Pigeontroller,2013-11-10 21:30:00,2793,Trolling may be boring but in late fall its not a tactic to ignore...Open water trolling the north end of Pigeon works well in oct/nov.
817847,Gregoire,2013-11-11 02:20:00,1397,"We tried it all today..I even slow rolled blades at the end of the day. We toughed it out, and may have been able to go a bit longer if not for a leakage issue on John's part, but ended up with a skunk."
817897,jimmer,2013-11-11 15:06:00,2730,"I have been having luck dragging small 3"" twister tails in the deeper water and outfishing my fishing partner 4-0. He was using the traditional muskie baits. Give it a try if there is a bit of a chop and you can drift over your favourite spots, you might be pleasantly surprised. Keep the bait as close to the bottom as you can."
817958,JoshS,2013-11-11 22:58:00,729,"I was out there this weekend.. did north Pigeon on Sunday... and not a sniff.  In fact, we didn't see a fish all weekend. First time both my buddy and I combined for a solid weekend skunking in a long time including no sightings. Makes you feel crazy for duking it out all weekend in that for nothing lol, not even a follow to add a piece to the puzzle. The fish were definitely off this weekend compared to the last few weeks. Tough to see follows with the conditions this weekend but thought I'd at least see a few. Tough weekend! Next weekend is looking a bit better weather wise."
818141,houski,2013-11-13 00:25:00,61,"Hey guys, I fished Pigeon on Sunday as well. We didn't do as well as I had hoped, but we managed two fish. Both came on pounders, and both came from about 25 fow, and right off bottom. After a 4 fish day on G Bay, on Saturday, I was really thinking we were gonna get em on Sunday, but the weather didn't cooperate."
