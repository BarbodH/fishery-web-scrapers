It is called EDDMapS Ontario and can be found here:  https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ontario/id727309669?mt=8  https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bugwood.eddmapsontario  Within the app, you can submit reports and view real-time point distribution maps centered on your current location.   The web version can be found here:  http://www.eddmaps.org/ontario/index.cfm With the on-line version, you can also download map data to a variety of formats such as Google Earth.  Cheers,   Jon"
