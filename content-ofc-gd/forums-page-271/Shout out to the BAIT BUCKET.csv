This is the case with the new store here in Barrie. I have bought a lot of stuff  since he open. Sometimes the price was a little high,but you pay for convenience.Earlly morning starts,and need something right away That, I have no issue with..Like I have always said in the past,customer service is number one in my books,and I will support this small independent store all the way,as long as Im treated like a person.  I have been looking at the Eskimo hub huts,and really liked them so,,,,,,,, "
817260,NAW,2013-11-07 17:58:00,4022,Good stuff Brian.  Thanks for posting this.  I'll have to go check him out.
817261,grizzlybri,2013-11-07 17:59:00,565,I have a cottage in Brighton and there is a store/outfitter there called Presuile Bay Outfitters and he is the same way. It is always fair prices and more often then not I find that his price are cheaper then the big box stores. He is also try's to help out and get in speciality items

817270,crappieperchhunter,2013-11-07 18:33:00,2582,"Never on that side of the lake much Brian but I'm glad the folks of Barrie have a good place to check out. I feel the same about Mark's in Bobcaygeon. Mark and his wife have always treated me good. Since we are up there every weekend all summer if I need something Mark doesn't have I tell him one weekend and if he can get it he has it for me when I come up the next weekend.  I'm pretty frugal with my money....but every once in awhile I grab something from him I know I can get cheaper in the city. That's my way of saying ""thank you"" for the way I'm treated there."
817279,davey buoy,2013-11-07 19:10:00,5505,"Good to hear Brian,I've bought a few things as well.Spent a hour or two with his dad Tom(both of us in the same trade).Nice guy as well.Had a great time with senior fishing the river."
817280,SirCranksalot,2013-11-07 19:32:00,3291,"I was there a few days ago and made a small purchase. I was pleased with the service and plan on going back. If you value your time as much as money you'll pay a premium to save the time it takes to go to a 'big box' store---not just for fishing, but for hardware as well for e.g."
817283,lew,2013-11-07 19:59:00,12766,"  Any small shop with a history of good customer service has nothing to fear from a big box opening in the area. Only those that haven't cared too much about the customers needs before the big box will have a problem.  Just the way it should be.  Nice to hear you found a good one Brian, it's not always an easy thing to do."

817298,jimmer,2013-11-07 20:45:00,2730,I find I purchase most of my supplies from the smaller businesses. Only go to the bigger stores on occasion when driving by them.

817726,Fish Farmer,2013-11-10 12:22:00,2234,"We have a shop in Hamilton that is just like the one you mention Brian. Bill's Bait & Tackle. Sometimes when I get in their shop I forget what I went in for because of the hospitality. I enjoy going there just to shoot the crap with owners Greg and Tim and the customers, it's a meeting place. If they don't have what you want, they'll be glad to get it for you. All the people I talk to have nothing but good things to say about Bill's."
817729,limeyangler,2013-11-10 13:04:00,5204,"Brian, you need to write an article for The Dryden Observer, the concept of customer service is completely alien to but a few businesses here…..just don't let them know you aint front 'round here….outsiders scare a lot of folk here….lol."

817751,Steve,2013-11-10 16:28:00,2075,"Bills is a great example.  With FW and Sail within 15 minutes, they have to take it a ""step above"" when it comes to service.  and they do!  but even with this top notch customer service the big box stores hurt their business."
818012,Cudz,2013-11-12 02:37:00,2652,Well I wish I had something good to say about The Bait Bucket but I don't yet so I won't say anything.  I will wait for a response back to an email I sent them before I say anything.
818036,Richie Razor,2013-11-12 06:29:00,536,"Small stores have there place, but you can't tell me that their sales dont take a beating  when a big box store opens up around the corner.... Despite the friendly atmosphere of such stores, in larger markets where the big box/category killer store exists, the small guy can't rely on a handful of regulars with all the costs of running a profitable business.  On the other hand, in smaller markets where there is no other option , or where the store has a level of specialization, the small guy can do well and survive."
818038,Old Ironmaker,2013-11-12 07:23:00,8243,"They are great people at Bill's.  I went in this year looking for 2 black Scotty Boy rod holders as the boat had the mounts preset flush into the gunnels. They didn't have any. Greg asked one of the guys to go to CTC across James to see if they had 2 in black. He would match their price if less. A free coffee latter he came back with 2 that were less than Bill's price. He sold them to me at Crappy Tires sale price. I went in for 2 rod holders and came out with them and 50 bucks worth of stuff on top of that.  Now that's service, and good sales tactics, keep me in there long enough and he knows I'm walking out lighter in the jeans."
818055,BillM,2013-11-12 14:15:00,17367,Greg and the boys @ Bills Bait and Tackle are great guys.   I wish I was closer so I could give them more of my business.
818157,Rob,2013-11-13 01:41:00,467,"Well I was in twice to get minnows and he was out both times. I know things get busy and stuff, but if your out of minnows, maybe offer some free worms to have your customer's coming back. Just sayin. Rob C"
