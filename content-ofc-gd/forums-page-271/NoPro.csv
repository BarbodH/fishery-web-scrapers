We started in April with a few slabs and finished in October with 4lbs largies. Usually only armed with an out dated cell phone, I captured a few key moments of the season to place on facebook or show the guy's when we talk fishing. No fancy gopro's or iphone apps but i thought i'd throw together a low tech video with the PC lol Anyway feel free to have a look  "

818532,Rod Caster,2013-11-15 02:53:00,5784,You are doing some good taking all those kids/people out fishing! Not a bad collection of photos
818553,206,2013-11-15 14:50:00,563,"Looks like a great season. THE BEST is at 1:54 (the eyes.... oh the eyes) ha ha ha   Cheers, Ron...  My nephew....my brother bought a brand new boat after fishing in mine, They had been out 2 times and never caught a thing. Guided them on the third outing as well as taking the hook with ridiculous rubber baits and multiple sinkers off the boys line and giving him a small spinnerbait. Caught his first musky and this his first wally ever!  A great evening!!  You are doing some good taking all those kids/people out fishing! Not a bad collection of photos I think it would be a crime not to share the passion of Fishing!!  Nothing beats time on the water with friends and family...great conversations and a few laughs. Getting people out where they never have gone and catching fish they have never seen. I remember my brother catching his first crappy almost 40 years old and never even heard of them.   I would love to get my hands on a better camera but for now the old celly does the trick to capture the thrills(unless its dark)  Thanks for all the kind reply's"
