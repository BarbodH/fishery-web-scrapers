581617,atvaholic,2011-05-11 01:49:00,271,"Well, we rolled into the park on Wednesday and set up camp. Weather was perfect!  We fished in and around the park for the 5 day duration. The bite was slow and tough....but we got some! Pics Below:  Still ice on the lakes!!!   Fishing a remote lake in my Zodiac -   A Few Specks from the lake:   We caught a total of 11 specks, Kept these six....and I ""planked"" em. So delicious!!   A few lunkers from inside the park:   The Stradic performed flawlessly:   Fished another lake outside the park and found this:   MMMM...another recipe. This was delicious...   An evening at the campsite   Ill probobly post this in another topic...but these signs were everywhere..and the C/O's were all over it..   Saw 14 moose! "
