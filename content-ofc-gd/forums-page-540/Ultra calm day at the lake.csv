The sunfish were everywhere in the shallows sunning themselves with their backs out of the water.  I saw many bass and a few perch in the shallows too, but no Crappie.  In spite of all the fish, that were visible, the bite was tough.  I caught a few using Berkley Trout Worms and other tiny baits, but the bite was definitely off!  I did have some fun fishing two small cranks at the same time.  I used two swivels, one sliding loose on the main line and one tied to the end of the main line.  I had a dropper on each swivel and a small crank with a single treble on each dropper.  This cast easily without tangling.  The two leaders are slightly different lengths, so one bait appears to be chasing the other.  By holding the rod tip high I could virtually wake them through the schools of Sunfish.  I got a few hits this way and it was more fun than still fishing. Garry2rs"

It was warm and there was almost no breeze.  It was wet out, but it wasn't really rain, more of a light drizzle.  In many cases this is great fishing weather.  About 1PM some real rain arrived.  After that it raining on and off about every 15 minutes, until we decided the bite wasn't good enough to keep us out there.  I wore my old rubber lined rain-suit and was probably wetter on the inside than on the outside...hahaha.  What a curse that old style wet weather gear was!  Thank goodness for Gore-Tex.  The fish were still there in the shallows, but the Crappie bite was very slow.  Even the Sunfish were not very active.  I spoke to several guys coming in from the Walleye spots and no one had fish.  If the fish aren't active now, there might be a big bite in a day or two when the new weather pattern settles in. Garry2R's"
