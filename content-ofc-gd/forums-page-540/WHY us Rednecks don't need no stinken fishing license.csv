The game warden asked the man, ""May I see your fishing license please?""  ""Naw, sir,"" replied the redneck. ""I don't need none of them there papers. These here are my pet fish.""""Pet fish??""  ""Yep. Once a week, I bring these here fish o'mine down to the lake and let 'em swim 'round for a while. Then when I whistle, they swim right back into my net and I take 'em home.""  ""What a line of horse crap....you're under arrest.""  The redneck said, ""It's the truth, Mr. Gov'ment Man. I'll show ya! We do this all the time!!""  ""WE do, now, do WE?"" smirked the warden. ""PROVE it!""  The redneck released the fish into the lake and stood and waited. After a few minutes, the warden said, ""Well?""  ""Well, WHUT?"" said the redneck.  The warden asked, ""When are you going to call them back?""  ""Call who back?""  ""The FISH,"" replied the warden!  ""Whut fish?"" asked the redneck.  MORAL OF THE STORY:  We may not be as smart as some city slickers, but we ain't as dumb as some government employees. You can say what you want about the South, but you never hear of anyone retiring and moving north."

582130,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-05-12 19:22:00,0,if you want to outsmart a government employee all you need to do is tell him it's time for coffee break and walk away.
