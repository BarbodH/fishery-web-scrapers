581956,solopaddler,2011-05-12 10:12:00,8605, Neither would I unless they're 20lb's and over Dan. The others are a nuisance.   Dave the flies look great buddy!
581957,Handlebarz,2011-05-12 10:28:00,3790,Very nice look for sure.  I hope you guys are going to bring a dentist as it seems there will be some teeth pulling then fish are in trouble.
581987,corvette1,2011-05-12 12:12:00,1765,awesome looking i want to see lot's of big pike pictures cought on those have a great time guy's
581995,Jds63,2011-05-12 12:44:00,1365,"those look awesome , Drifter .... looking forward to the epic trip log ...."
582023,lookinforwalleye,2011-05-12 15:20:00,4399,"I wish I was going,can`t wait to read the report!"
582044,DRIFTER_016,2011-05-12 16:18:00,10439,"  That's ok Dan they're not for the faint of heart and only real manly men chase them. Oh, I think you spilled some tea on your sweater vest. Some soda water will take care of that in a jiffy!!!!"
582102,redskullz,2011-05-12 18:18:00,55,Sweet flies!! What do you guys use for leaders?
582127,DRIFTER_016,2011-05-12 19:08:00,10439, Heavy Flourocarbon (40-60#) and wire either single strand/7 strand or tieable.
582295,redskullz,2011-05-13 02:23:00,55,"Nice....i'd love to bring in some huge pike on a flyrod...that would be so fun. Ive tied some smaller pike flies and got some decent smaller pike(8lbs), but no huge ones. There is not alot of huge pike in the area where we live, but i have no doubt there is a couple of 30 pounders here and there.(southern georgian bay)"
582312,Twocoda,2011-05-13 02:39:00,4130,If you strike out on the Pike ...you can always use them again in the fall for the salmon run...  NICE JOB!
542980,DRIFTER_016,2011-01-24 02:40:00,10439,When these bad boys hit the water on May 21st 2011!!!!              
542985,mercman,2011-01-24 02:49:00,7054,Awesome Job !!!!!!!!! Now i understand the thread topic.Serious problems indeed
542987,Nipfisher,2011-01-24 02:54:00,2449,Nice job. What is the weight to them? Looks like a #4 hook?
542993,Gregoire,2011-01-24 03:11:00,1397,Those look awesome!
542994,DRIFTER_016,2011-01-24 03:13:00,10439,"  2/0 and 3/0 Gamakatsu Saltwater hooks with 1/4"" cone heads and 7/32"" real eyes dumb bell eyes."
543015,BillM,2011-01-24 05:00:00,17367,"Dave, I'll leave you a few mid 40's to catch, but I'm putting a 50incher or bigger under my belt this year"
543019,DRIFTER_016,2011-01-24 05:47:00,10439,  After Solo and I sting all the biguns near the camp we will be running the rapid upriver. Try and follow if you dare!!
543022,solopaddler,2011-01-24 11:55:00,8605,"They look great buddy, how long are they?"
543053,DRIFTER_016,2011-01-24 15:55:00,10439," They're about 5 or 6 inches, not giants but I have a couple of big boys hidden away."
543055,solopaddler,2011-01-24 16:04:00,8605," That's what I thought. Not big enough!  At least 8"", and mostly black with a bit of red mixed in would be good."
543060,Moosebunk,2011-01-24 16:36:00,3970,"Those will be great Dave.  If the Skat fish hit'em like they will on the Moose, my bet is the white & red and the yellow & red.  You got soooooo much more winter time to tie some more up.  Hehe!"
543078,solopaddler,2011-01-24 17:36:00,8605,Forgot to mention the ones you tied with the different coloured heads...that's pretty important.  If they're all one colour you'll miss a lot of fish. It seems they key in on the head when it's a different colour.  If you tie some larger black ones up give them an orange head.
543093,BillM,2011-01-24 18:00:00,17367,"  With all the snow, I doubt there will be many rapids to run compared to last year, lol.    Which will be nice, way more water to fish that's easy to get to.  I'm sure my partner will be bringing the flyrod as well, should be a great week!  Wanna tie me up some some articulated leeches?  I need some for the resident brownies in Grey/Bruce  :)"
543113,TJQ,2011-01-24 18:56:00,7806,Nice!! I was worried for a minute there!!
543125,solopaddler,2011-01-24 19:13:00,8605,"Don't mean to be overly critical, but the hooks aren't big enough either."
543131,misfish,2011-01-24 19:28:00,29133,  Guess Dave wont be lending any out then.  Nice work Dave. Love the roaster looking one.
543186,EddieNorth,2011-01-24 22:11:00,64,"Sorry guys you should have read the small print on the site,all tackle not including rods,reels and line,  MUST BE PURCHASED FROM THE OUTFITTER."
543195,solopaddler,2011-01-24 22:37:00,8605,"  But Eddie, we'd like to actually catch fish."
543198,misfish,2011-01-24 22:48:00,29133,That was real cruel Mike. Thought you said eddie would never steer ya wrong?  Hows Zoey doing btw? Not to high jack this thread.LOL
543204,solopaddler,2011-01-24 23:01:00,8605," Hey if you can't poke fun at your friends then who?   Zoey's doing great! She was 8lb's when we got her at new years and last week at the vet she was up to 121/2. She's a smart dog, she's learning fairly quick."
543208,DRIFTER_016,2011-01-24 23:04:00,10439,"  No problem Eddie, just take it off what you owe me for wesite design."
543249,moparhawk,2011-01-25 00:05:00,146,How do you get any tying done sitting in front of the big tv???? Just kiddin thats where I tie too
581896,DRIFTER_016,2011-05-12 01:02:00,10439,7 Days until I take to the air!!!! The flyboxes are ready.  
581897,danbouck,2011-05-12 01:05:00,4380,They look awesome!
581907,danc,2011-05-12 02:27:00,4677,"LOL... I wouldn't tie my shoes up to catch a pike, let alone some custom flies."
