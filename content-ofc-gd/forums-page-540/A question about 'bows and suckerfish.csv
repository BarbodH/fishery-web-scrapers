It seems obvious that you'd snag a few but is it also a sign that rainbows are not around? I'd rather avoid the suckers, but they hold in such nice pools. Some help please."
582273,Dutchy,2011-05-13 01:52:00,416,I've caught bows and suckers in the same pool many times.
582274,Twocoda,2011-05-13 01:56:00,4130,move upstream a bit ...the suckers are congregating to get the stray eggs from the bows..unless of course they are spawning themselves (which is likely) so move down stream to try to get the bows that are picking up the sucker eggs...fair catch a hen sucker and tie up some sucker eggs...you might be surprised...
582278,dhickey,2011-05-13 02:05:00,1038,Catch a few suckers and use them for chanle cats.  question..? does rotting sucker meat work for karp?  
582288,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-05-13 02:16:00,0,"i find that i can catch fish in the midst of suckers although often i don't catch much on roe when they are in the river.  2 nights ago i didn't get a sniff on anything but 4"" pink worms and big gaudy flies."
582292,ChrisK,2011-05-13 02:20:00,2772,Move downstream. Rainbows are probably feeding on sucker spawn
582363,bow slayer,2011-05-13 04:47:00,1074,"generally in a pool the bows will be in the tailout. If you spend more time fishing the tailout you should hook more bows than suckers. Now saying that does not mean there will be no bows in the head or middle of the pool,this is usally the best spots for dropbacks but you will hook into more suckers as well."
