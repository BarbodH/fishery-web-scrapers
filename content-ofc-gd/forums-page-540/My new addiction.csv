I've recently been learning trout and since the browns around here are slow i'd go in search of the elusive brook trout. Needless to say after staring at maps forever and talking to some friends, I ventured out in search of this beautiful fish. After a few failed attempts and wet feet i found them and needless to say, they are gorgeous. If it wasnt hazardous to their health i wish i could just stare at them outside the water lol.  Anyways, I'm hooked, having a great time exploring for these fish and even greater time succeeding.  Only had one good pic of a 9 incher but a beauty in its on accord.     Tight lines friends"

582311,redskullz,2011-05-13 02:37:00,55,"Yeah brookies are such a beautiful fish...and often the scenery that surrounds the creeks they lurk in, is just about as amazing! If you want bigger ones go north and fish some of the tiny lakes that are stocked in a canoe."
582314,camillj,2011-05-13 02:39:00,1988,Probably the prettiest fish in the most serene habitat ... a total real fishing experience ... once you get the taste for it you stay awake nights researching and planning your next trips - Welcome to the club !
