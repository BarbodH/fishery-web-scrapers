Thank god for the Croix warranty!  Here was her last fight...a banged up Gladiator of a buck  , fought like a Walleye on Heroin     and was released to fight another day. My best attempt at the Solopaddler smirk  "
582558,GreenCanada,2011-05-13 18:57:00,375,"It snapped in two spots to make it a 4 piece? Yikes if that's the case. Though, that is a beauty catch!"
582574,solopaddler,2011-05-13 19:43:00,8605,The solopaddler smirk?   Exactly how does a rod break into that many pieces? LOL!
582575,Pikeslayer,2011-05-13 19:53:00,1443,  Hmmm...... looks 'intact' in the photo. Did somebody do something clumsy  Slayer

582577,archie_james_c,2011-05-13 19:59:00,618,"Hahahah come on guys I thought you were steelheaders! 9 foot rod...2 pieces....I had the 2 pieces rubber banded together, went to slip it into the back of my buddies trunk to go to next pool, damn trunk lid slipped out of my hand and SLICE! The damn lid sheared my rod halves in half again!"

582741,solopaddler,2011-05-14 10:10:00,8605, I've got another rod for you bud just oozing with mojo.  Archie if you decide you don't want the Avid I'll buy it from you. It'll make a perfect live bait rigging rod for walleye.
