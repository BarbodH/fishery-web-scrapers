581967,aplumma,2011-05-12 11:10:00,6896,Thanks all for the wishes. I hope that at the age of 49 I can get past the paintball gauntlet with minimum damage. I did not do the birthday sucking in of the gut in front of the mirror thinggy I figured I would take the day off from that. Fishing is planned for the weekend I had too many people who needed plumbing done today to go.  :lol:   Art
581969,Tarzan's Jane,2011-05-12 11:15:00,1183,  You were not 49 last year???  I've often wondered about this and hoping maybe you can answer.....The milkman left his customers with white teeth...what does a plumber leave his customers?       I just wanted to make you smile...please don't answer that question.
