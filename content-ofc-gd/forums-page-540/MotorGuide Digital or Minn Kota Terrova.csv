581882,buckhorn250,2011-05-12 00:29:00,85,A friend has a four year old Terrova and stowing and deploying is no fun. Are the MotorGuide Digitals easier -says one hand stow and deploy? Any feedback would be appreciated
581883,workwear,2011-05-12 00:33:00,592,i would stay with the terrova......one word...IPILOT!!!!!
581885,scugpg,2011-05-12 00:36:00,1373,Terrova is so easy to deploy are you sure it isn't a powerdrive? Terrova is the best electric steer out there not to mention ipilot
581889,BFSC Kevin,2011-05-12 00:47:00,1351,yeah.. terrova is SOOOO easy to deploy... you might be thinking about the powerdrive.. now that one is a pain the rear.
