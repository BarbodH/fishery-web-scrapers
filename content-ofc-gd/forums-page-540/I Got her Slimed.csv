That will give us lots of fishing time We headed out at 9 this morning and caught our first fish in the new boat. Ya its a perch, but who cares it slimed the boat!!!!  We caught a nice meal of perch, then this little bugger hit. I havent caught a Barbotte(local for catfish)  They are sposed to be good, but i have never tried them, and have no idea how to clean or cook them. Finally, this guy hit my worm like a freight train.He wasnt the biggest pike i have caught, but who cares, its slime   Now some scenery.    So Do i get my man card back now, even if i use multiple emoticons to express how i feel  "

582656,danc,2011-05-13 23:49:00,4677,Good job Paul. Sounds like you're going to have a great summer.
582658,spincast,2011-05-13 23:55:00,3279,  or perhaps its just reloacting to a more central location?

582684,Live2fish85,2011-05-14 01:44:00,1633,Nice job Paul. Glad to see you got out and landed some fish in the new boat. Not a bad pike for the first of many to come I'm sure.
582686,Cudz,2011-05-14 01:59:00,2652,+1 for wearing the PFD. +1 for catching fish. A big +1 for that seet moustache of yours. -1 for the glove (you need to man up a bit on the glove front)  Congrats.
582689,irishfield,2011-05-14 02:03:00,26272,Do what ever you want Paul.. many are just jealous you're out there fishing and they're not!
582692,darsky,2011-05-14 02:08:00,586,I fished that area last July Paul. It was so weed choked outside of the small boat channel.
582694,mercman,2011-05-14 02:12:00,7054,"Clean as a whistle today D, Some new weed growth, but besides that, clean. There was a hole load of debris though. From logs to a dead deer"
