One guy had the 4runner for 12 years and 740k.  My diesel gets better fuel economy  city and highway and towing my lund. and room in the rear seat to fit 3 kid seats."
581834,Terry,2011-05-11 21:29:00,14456,my diesel gets better fuel economy too
581881,bassassin,2011-05-12 00:26:00,152,"I have an 02 xterra best vehicle i ever owned, rock solid! Pulls an 06 fisher total weight 2800lbs like nothing, have had it out in the middle of simcoe in February without issue. i mistreat it but she still always brings me home! 191k and still runs like she has 60k like when i got her in 05'. Take the X!!! "
581890,bassassin,2011-05-12 00:47:00,152, stick with the v6 3.3 xterra xe hes right i havent heard too many positive things about the supercharged model...
581993,SylvanOwner,2011-05-12 12:31:00,266,"I also have an 02 XTerra 4x4, only had it a year now but I would still say it's the best built vehicle I've ever owned.  Previously had a couple Explorers and Bronco II.  It's a 5 speed with about 170k on it.  I struggle to get 500km to a tank in the summer and less than 450km in the winter and I baby it.  Tank is 65 liters.  It's not the supercharged version (didn't want that) and it's pretty gutless.  I tow a 14' tinny with full floor and a 25h.p. motor, 1200ish lbs. fully loaded with fuel, batteries etc.   Pulls it no problem and doesn't use much extra fuel while towing.  It's great in 4x4 in the winter but absolutely terrible in 2wd - worst of all the suv's I've owned.  The rear seats are a bit of pain to fold down, the actual seat (part you sit on only) has to be removed and either left behind or packed in somewhere.  I've heard rumours of the head gasket issue but I know I don't lose any coolant or burn any oil....period.  Great truck until you have to put gas in it....."
581994,lookinforwalleye,2011-05-12 12:41:00,4399, Amazing designers can`t figure out how to make a seat! Before the wife bought her Journey we had a serious looked at a Ford Escape until we saw that you had to remove the headrests to fold the seats down!!!
582059,Fisherpete,2011-05-12 17:00:00,1814,"Funny you just mentioned the Escape headrests... I just got a 2011 Escape in March, and know where my 3 rear headrests are? In my garage in a milk crate LMAO! Got really tired really fast of having to remove them to fold those seats down... and now I can actually see something in my rearview mirror as well, they are in the sightlines pretty badly.... I can only imagine how bad it would be for a shorter driver than I!  Your Civic should pull a full sized bassboat with NO issues Henry!!! What are they rated to pull, at least a bag of groceries, so long as there is no potatoes in the bag... hee hee hee... a friend of mine has an older 4runner and loves it, he had a ridiculous amount of kms on it and it has never failed him."
582166,ohhenrygsr,2011-05-12 21:17:00,947, LOL hey man getting 550K on $45 worth of fuel @ 1.39 L is awesome.  This is a big step for me tow vehicle and double my gas payments   I'M FREAKING OUT TYPING THIS REPLY!!
582167,ohhenrygsr,2011-05-12 21:17:00,947,I saw a decent 2004 Nissan PathFinder I guess the MPG is still the same as a Xterra
581347,ohhenrygsr,2011-05-10 13:46:00,947,Anyone have one and how do they like it.  MPG etc...
581355,Fisherman,2011-05-10 14:09:00,7201,"Not exactly the same, but my son has a Frontier with the V6, 4x4.  He likes it, not a bad gas hog, winter it definitely sucks down a bunch more around town, on the highway at speed limits it does quite well, go beyond that and you can watch the fuel gauge move.  He's had a couple small blips with some sensors, seems like after market parts don't/won't work well for any amount of time.  He's looking at getting one with the longer box."
581361,lookinforwalleye,2011-05-10 14:29:00,4399,"There are a few OFC`ers that have them and from what I recall they love them, I am sure they will chime in. You`ll get about 25-30 mpg on the hiway and probably 15-20 in the city, which is about the same as my 2008 Jeep Liberty."
581364,lookinforwalleye,2011-05-10 14:41:00,4399,BTW the Natural Resources Canada site has a real good search tool for MPG on vehicles if you want to compare!
581374,The Urban Fisherman,2011-05-10 14:50:00,2050,"I had a 2000 nissan Xterra and LOVED it.  It's now my sister-in-law's truck and going strong with near 300,000 KM's on it.  I served me well the 3 years or so that I owned it.  The only reason we got rid of it was because we needed something that could fit 3 car seats for the kids.  I thought it was a little stiff on gas....until I started driving my 5.7L Hemi Dodge Durango... lol"
581384,bigbuck,2011-05-10 15:17:00,2449,www.fueleconomy.gov  It's a US gov't website that gives the EPA fuel economy ratings for vehicles that are current back to the 90's.
581404,ohhenrygsr,2011-05-10 16:00:00,947,"Thanks very much for the help guys.  I'm looking at the Acura MDX, Xterra and 4Runner"
581407,The Urban Fisherman,2011-05-10 16:05:00,2050," I was looking at the MDX's as well for a while as they have a third row of seating... in the end they were to pricey for me as I could get a WAY newer Durango for the same amount of money... but I did read a lot of negative reviews about the MDX.... of course there's always more negative reviews online than positive ones so you have to take it for what it is.  Good luck with the search - choosing a vehicle is always a tough one.  Also, my Dad had a early to mid 90's 4runner when I was a kid and that thing was indestructible - a solid reliable SUV back then.  Personally I'd go with the Xterra or the 4Runner if I had a choice.  They're work horses..."
581413,craigdritchie,2011-05-10 16:34:00,1586,"Buddy of mine loves his Xterra. He tows a big boat with it and has no qualms about driving off-road. I'm not sure what year his is, bit it's about the right vintage. This guy isn't exactly gentle with his stuff, yet the truck's never let him down.  I also have a co-worker who beats the tar out of his 4Runner at every opportunity. And, he just loves it. Interestingly, the 4Runner was the only Toyota model not involved in their recall troubles last year.  Both the Xterra and 4Runner are known to be reliable, dependable trucks with decent towing capacities and good 4x4 capability. Not so sure about the Acura since I don't know anyone who has one."

581567,ohhenrygsr,2011-05-11 00:15:00,947,LOL thanks for all the replies.  I'm going from a Honda civic to an SUV so i'm just freakin out a little bit with everything lol.
581573,BFSC Kevin,2011-05-11 00:36:00,1351,"how about the toyota rav4 with optional third row(if you are looking for that), v6, awd? towing cap is 3500lb with fuel economy at 25 mpg city and 37 mpg highway"
581669,Afraz,2011-05-11 04:43:00,250," I dont think the Rav4 comes with optional 3rd row seating, there is barely room in it as is. Maybe its the highlander you are speaking of ?"
581672,BFSC Kevin,2011-05-11 04:49:00,1351,rav4 does
581673,Freshtrax,2011-05-11 05:16:00,2215,my friend bought one two weeks after driving it outa the showroom he crossed a small creek with it about 2ft deep. the engine shut down in the middle. we towed it to the dealership and said it was not covered.  oilpan was FULL of water.  he dropped the keys on the counter and said thats fine i havent made the first payment yet.   this was right after  9\11 0 $ down.  it was a toomraider edition frontier.
581683,blue pickeral,2011-05-11 09:39:00,267,"Had 3 Nissan pickups - from 1989 onward to 2000 - and they got progressively worse each time. (kept giving me good deals on each one)  Will never forgive that company for manufacturing electrical connections to the fuel pump of three different metals. Add electricity and connector corroded with fuel pump shut off without warning. Connector inaccessable in fuel tank. Stuck in blizzard for hours.  After market parts rare, OEM parts expensive, service departments the worst I have ever dealt with.  Get the Toyota."
581694,Fisherman,2011-05-11 11:13:00,7201," Ya, and the Titanic rammed an iceberg, it was supposed to be unsinkable too.  I have my doubts about, ""crossed a small creek with habout 2 feet of water"" and  ""oil pan full of water""   more likely tried to cross the amazon at warp drive."
581696,Afraz,2011-05-11 11:17:00,250, LOL that was hilarious XD
581702,aplumma,2011-05-11 11:46:00,6896,Sorry but the Nissan name is aces in my book. I have owned Nissan when it was Datsun and presently own a 05 Titian all have been good to me. I have had recalls on it but what truck hasn't? All were handled professionally with concern to my time and a free loaner when needed. I guess Nissan Canada is different but I hope it is fixed they really are good vehicles.   Art
581723,Rustic-Fisher,2011-05-11 12:40:00,826,"Had a 2002 SC xterra,  head gasket went at 145k, SC(supercharged) only ran on premium fuel. WORST fuel milage I have ever seen in an SUV. Stay away from the S/C models."
581726,lookinforwalleye,2011-05-11 12:50:00,4399, But really small suitable for a small child or the dog!
581738,bigbuck,2011-05-11 13:32:00,2449,The fuel economy ratings on that vintage Xterra are pretty dismal. That is the same type of economy as a big Yuke or Suburban. I'd take the big fullsize V8 SUV over any of the Japanese made midsizes that come with a V6 if the fuel economy is comparable but that's just me.
581785,DRIFTER_016,2011-05-11 17:08:00,10439, I went from a Civic to an SUV too. Civic si to Pilot    :thumbsup_anim:
581808,BFSC Kevin,2011-05-11 19:34:00,1351,How do you like your pilot? I have a '06 pilot. Towing about 2500lb in D3 I averaged about 17.5L/100km
581815,DRIFTER_016,2011-05-11 20:22:00,10439," Mine's an '05. It's a great vehicle.    :thumbsup_anim: I can't say exactly what I get for mileage (I don't really check   ) I can say that on my trips to Alaska I get about 20-21 mpg on the hwy. Towing my boat (18' Fisher aluminum with a 90), I haven't checked but I only have towed a maximum of 30kms with it. I'm able to tow the boat in OD without the tranny hunting at all (weight is in the 1,800-2,000# range with trailer). I will drop to D3 in hilly areas if the tranny starts hunting though. I did tow my Rockwood Freedom 1980 camper to Alaska and it did use a bunch more fuel than when not towing but that was expected. It's now in storage in Alaska so I don't have to tow it back and forth."
