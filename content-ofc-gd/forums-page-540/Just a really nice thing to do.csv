Each year these guys stock a swimming pool in Hamilton with trout and invite hundreds of challenged kids and people with special needs to come out and catch a fish. The Hamilton Rotary Sunshine Club funds the whole works.  This is a really, really nice thing that these volunteers do every year, and they should be applauded for it.  Next year is the 25th anniversary. Wouldn't it be nice if this kind of program could extend into other communities across Ontario? Perhaps its a project some OFC types might be interested in piking up ...... just thinking out loud.  Click here to watch a video of this year's event."

The crowd was large and the fish were plenty, I did see a number caught while I was there but it wasn't fast and furious.  Here's are own Fish Farmer who helped out for a few days.....    My friend Tibor who's been there everyday.....    and a couple of random shots, you can see the bottom of the pool is black with trout.      and a video link from the local news paper....  videozone"

582672,HTHM,2011-05-14 00:58:00,4082,Kudos to the organizers of this event. It is nice to see individuals with special needs able to enjoy the thrill of catching a fish. The funny thing is my wife who is very involved in the care community that surrond this community has not heard very much of this event before.
