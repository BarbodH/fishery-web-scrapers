582203,MSBruno,2011-05-12 23:18:00,369,"Hi All,  Trying to start my '94 2-stroke 40 Johnson and I'm not getting any spark.  It crank's but it won't fire up.  The spark plugs are new.  Kill tether is on.  I feel like it's something simple, but I can't wrap my head around it.  Any ideas?"
582205,Sinker,2011-05-12 23:39:00,8692,"Check for spark, if you have that, check for fuel.  S."
582206,MSBruno,2011-05-12 23:55:00,369," I don't have spark.  I have the spark plugs outside the block, grounded to the block and I don't get spark when I crank.  I have fuel, it shoots out the spark plug hole when I crank"
582208,Sinker,2011-05-13 00:01:00,8692,"Well, it could be many things. You sure the kill switch is attached properly? Loose connection somewhere in the ignition? A blown fuse somewhere.......the list is endless.  S."
582210,MSBruno,2011-05-13 00:08:00,369, Kill switch is connected  The only fuse I see under the cowel is fine.  The fuses under the dash are fine too
582225,discophish,2011-05-13 01:06:00,392,"List too big to mention, but if all of the obvious seem fine, and your not lighting up on either coil, perhaps check the power pack.  My 2 cents worth.  Good luck with the solution"
582234,mukluk,2011-05-13 01:18:00,196,Sounds like the same problem my buddy had on his motor.Problem was the kill switch. Put an ohm meter across the two wires of the kill switch. With the landyard clip installed---- no continuity----open switch--- not a problem with switch; however move the clip and watch ometer for shorts With landyard clip uninstalled------continuity------closed switch; switch working properly-------no spark at plugs
582243,Kerry,2011-05-13 01:25:00,383,I'd try bypassing the kill switch and see if it starts then go from there. Kerry
582258,MSBruno,2011-05-13 01:36:00,369," I just tested the kill switch:  The landyard clips on and depressed the button on the kill switch.  I have continuity with the lanyard on AND off.  Should it break continuity with the lanyard off, like a reverse switch?  should I just cut the wires and see if it fires up?  will that give me the best result?"
582263,irishfield,2011-05-13 01:42:00,26272,The kill switch grounds the coil out when the clip comes out.. if it has continuity all the time then that is your problem. Unhook a wire and she'll fire right up. Replace the kill switch if you're driving with the lanyard hooked to your belt.. if not.. well.. don't waste the money.
582309,Freshtrax,2011-05-13 02:35:00,2215,rust in the kill switch.....seen it on many snowmobiles after storing for the summer....just wiggle it arround for a few min to clean it out>
582330,MSBruno,2011-05-13 03:00:00,369,thx everyone.  I'll try it tomorrow  Mark
582419,oldphart,2011-05-13 12:37:00,665,"~~Sound similar to what mine was doing, spent 20 some hour trace the power leads and finally took it to Weber's in Markham, and let Frank find it and fix it only cost 3 hours labour"
582437,Uncle Buck,2011-05-13 13:25:00,1000,pretty rare that both coil packs will go at the same time...  most likely the kill switch...
582461,MSBruno,2011-05-13 14:18:00,369,I cut the kill switch out and nothing  Any other ideas?
582499,fisher,2011-05-13 16:35:00,451," It sounds simple but I will mention it anyways (as it has happened to me).  Are your batteries fully charged and putting out enough juice?  If not, you may get it to crank but without enough juice it will not turn over.  Also, make sure your battery connections are clean/rust free/secure.  I live in Woodbridge too in case you need to try out a different battery."
582507,MSBruno,2011-05-13 17:06:00,369,"It's alive!  Thanks everyone.  Bad Ground + Faulty Kill Switch  Watch out fish tomorrow, rain and lightning stay away."
