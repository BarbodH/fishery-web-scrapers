581911,Live2fish85,2011-05-12 02:42:00,1633,"Well I got off the day to a bit of a crappy start today, I had a appointment with my Cardiolagist and after wearing a loop monitor for 2 weeks and the other office having the results for over a week and a half, I was told today that they can't really determine what the problem is forsure as they haven't sent the results from the loop monitor yet lol. So back I go in another 2 weeks and hope that they know or have an idea, it looks like my good job with full benefits is something I won't be able to go back to as it's to much for my heart to handle. Kind of a bummer first time my heart problems have held me back but oh well life goes on I can still fish. That is just what I did to. I stopped at Bills Bait and with the great service there I was lead in the right direction, I was set up with everything I need and stuff that worked. He gave me all the help I needed and it worked, I got to the lake at my parents around 2:30pm and had my line wet by 2:45pm.  Well after about a hour and a half and a few misses FISH ON. I got him in and he was a nice 30"" carp weighted 12.10 lbs.    After getting my line set back up and ready I throw it in and within another 15 mins WHAM another one takes, it was around the 30"" range but it was a 11.10 lbs Carp needless to say another great fight.    Well I got the line ready again and in it goes I landed another 1 about half an hour later and it was 28"" and 12.5 lbs. I did the same set up the line in it goes but didn't have and hit for over an hour, I wasn't done though as I could see them jumping around like crazy so I knew they were there and it was enough to keep my patience going. well it payed off all of a sudden without any warning on the rod Whack this thing just started ripping line by far the best fight I had of the day it was about 31.5"" and 16.4 lbs it was awesome I tie the line again to make sure of any week spots and back in it goes well not even 20 mins later another one and it was another great fight.  I finally got him in and it was a beauty 32"" and 16.14 lbs. I'll save you the pics off the others in between but heres the picture of the fight and the fish.  Setting the hook   Fighting it near the water    And then the results    All in all it was a great day in the end I landed 5 for 7 and it was my first time targeting carp. Thanks to the guy a Bills Bait with out his help I doubt I would have had the luck I did. I will continue to go for the carp as they are a great fight not the nicest looking fish but they are growing on me lol. This should also help my team lol. GO TEAM 10.  Chris"

581998,Live2fish85,2011-05-12 13:10:00,1633,"Thanks everyone, as for the 33"" that's awesome lol. Just means I will try harder today to beat that I am heading back up for some more carp tonight. My heart was alright tackling the carp thank god, I am lucky for that. My job was alot more physical I was lifting over 40 000 lbs in a 8 hour day. But hope I get a monster over 33"" inches and and water should be calm maybe some walleye tonight.  Chris"
