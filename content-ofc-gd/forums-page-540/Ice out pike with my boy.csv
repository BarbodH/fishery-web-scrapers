582229,irishfield,2011-05-13 01:08:00,26272,Very nice Simon! Just watched the video with Leah and we both said the same thing... you can sure tell when a kid grows up around the water.
582233,PikeMolester,2011-05-13 01:15:00,428,Hey Limey I'm working at a lodge on eagle lake..just got here 3 days ago. You should come by at some point during the season. Would be my first time fishing with an OFC'er...and it would be 1000+ kilos away from home lol
582235,Nipfisher,2011-05-13 01:18:00,2449,Great release Simon.
582245,splashhopper,2011-05-13 01:27:00,2931,kids are fearless.....
582246,limeyangler,2011-05-13 01:28:00,5204,  he's pretty good now Wayne...he did land in the drink the other day though...he was trying to launch his plastic sleigh and SPLASH...he was soaked through but only cried when he realised i was going to take him inside to change!
582250,irishfield,2011-05-13 01:31:00,26272,"The plunk in the water was good for him.... and just watching him on the rock with you, you can tell he's a ""water"" person and knows what it's all about already. This summer you'll make a swimmer out of him and you can rest easy."
582252,GBW,2011-05-13 01:32:00,8460,nice one Simon/Jack!
582268,Blue Lk,2011-05-13 01:47:00,337,"Very good vid of ""famous Jack"",both my boys grew up around the lake,the very best place to grow up,IMHO."
582270,Blue Lk,2011-05-13 01:51:00,337, Welcome to God's country. Eagle is a beauiful lake & a world class fishery.You will enjoy this summer for sure. Which lodge are you working at?
582280,discophish,2011-05-13 02:06:00,392,"Off to a great start Simon and family!  Isn't it great when it's just beginning, and that you know you have the entire season ahead of you!  Gotta love it"
582293,PikeMolester,2011-05-13 02:20:00,428,Loving it so far. Just need to get my non resident license so I can try n get some smallies before pike n walleye opens. I'm at Eagle Lake Island Lodge.
582375,limeyangler,2011-05-13 10:47:00,5204," Your on!  And if you get time any day soon to try for bass and pike...you could always pm me and tell me what time you are picking me up at the Eagle River landing...its a 15 minute ride from my place and i think thats where your camp picks up guests.    As one who works in  the 'social services' sector Blair, you of all people would know that allowing the fish to release itself is all about 'empowerment'    Not always a good thing....lol    Yeah...he has been to swimming lessons since he was 2 months old, gonna try and get him enthused about getting his head under with a mask and snorkel this summer...i know a lake where he could watch the perch and bass swimming around.    Thanks Geoff, hopefully the catches increase in size a bit for me this season!    Absolutely the best place...oh...and thanks for the link to the cottage website...interesting.    Absofreekinlutely Disco...i'm so pumped...only 9 more days and i'll be hitting Lac Seul...cant wait!"
