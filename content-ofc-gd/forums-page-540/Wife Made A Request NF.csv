582421,Live2fish85,2011-05-13 12:41:00,1633,Wow I have seen a few of your paintings and they are awesome I love art myself and I draw a ton I have the most respect for painters as I know how hard it is. I can't paint at all lol. Made on good painting in my life and wasn't like that. So hard to work colours together and shade with paint but you truly do a great job with it. Good work hope to see more. I thought you were going to say maybe you have heard of me Im from Canada's group of seven lol. Regarles that is some great work.  Chris.
582431,bushart,2011-05-13 12:58:00,2628,Thanks Chris---you are very kind  I post outdoorsy paintings on here just for something different--or add variety to the board.  Sometimes these places are just somewhere I'd like to be.  Thanks Again
582434,Live2fish85,2011-05-13 13:19:00,1633,"No problem I really like your art and wish I could paint like that, I love going to Algonquin and portaging in some lakes and just draw some of the beauty out there."
