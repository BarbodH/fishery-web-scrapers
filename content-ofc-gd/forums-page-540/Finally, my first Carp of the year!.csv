Today I went from 8-10am after a night shift.  5 takes, 2 well hooked fish on and one landed. 35.75"" x 26"" - My personal best. Not 100% on weight but I use an online calculator to estimate- just shy of 30# supposedly. And after having to lift it out of the water I believe it! It might be a bit of a heavy guess but it was definitely over 25. Really need to invest in a scale and sling as was previously suggested in a different carp post.    Switched from a method feeder to an inline bolt rig with 2 kernels of corn and one floating gulp corn on the hair for this outing. I could see some carp feeding in the shallows...very slowly and very deliberately. Might explain why I had so many short light takes. Friday the 13th rocks!"
582478,hammercarp,2011-05-13 15:04:00,964,Congratulations on your new PB. Nice lookin carp.
582492,Live2fish85,2011-05-13 15:59:00,1633,Nice one man. That's 2 monster carp in just 2 days. My carp I got yesterday was 37.5 inches and was 28.13 lbs so good chance it could have been 30 lbs mine was pushing it.
582528,Leecher,2011-05-13 17:48:00,7832,Nice  Congrats
582602,Victor,2011-05-13 21:27:00,1609,Great work! Persistence sure paid off.  Regardless whether it's a 30 or not I'm sure it put up a fun fight and it's a nice clean fish!
582620,Marko,2011-05-13 22:17:00,854,wow that's a big girl. Way to go man
582739,iCarp,2011-05-14 10:00:00,50,"That's a beautiful, fat, and clean fish.  Congrats on your new PB.  And thanks for the details about how you caught it.  I'm surprised that a simple bolt rig produced where the method feeder failed.  And I might just pick up some Gulp floating corn at Bill's this morning- brilliant idea."
582742,Photoz,2011-05-14 10:13:00,792,"Geeze . . ..  I'm feelin' kinda left out . . .  .   talkin' t'under dunders and rain out this way ALL weekend . . ..    no way I'ma gonna sit out on some lake shore with a 13' lightning attractor beside me!! BUT, look out NEXT weekend, I'll be unloading my whole arsenal . . ..    barbecued carp-burgers for all! These are some damn nice fish being posted. Just wait till the best carper of 'em all comes outta retirement, eh Twilight?"
582770,limeyangler,2011-05-14 12:22:00,5204,Beauty fish...very clean.
582805,baitrummer,2011-05-14 14:53:00,24,Congrats!
582815,mbosh1980,2011-05-14 16:51:00,349, Thanks.  I find the 2-1 rig helps to make it easier for the fish to pick up without really popping it up off bottom. Oh btw it leaks everywhere like every other gulp alive product. Ziploc bag is a must.
