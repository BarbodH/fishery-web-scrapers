Shallow, maybe 2-6 feet in places,with a deep ravine 20 feet, all along it. There are numerous small indents or bays filled with wild rice stalks along the length of it.I'm gonna cruise up and down this shoreline pitching spinner baits,top waters and some Handlebarz, for big Northern Pike And i am staying out till i'm slimed .The water was 52 degrees last Saturday so i figure they will still be shallow, soaking up the sun.We are gonna do the same thing tomorrow too, cause i'm taking the day off.Weather is sposed to change in the next 24 hours, with rain forcast for the next week. Any tips would be nice.  Paul  "

582074,manitoubass2,2011-05-12 17:38:00,11391,"jig and a minnow is always my first option.  I've had some luck with smaller shallow water cranks retrieved slowly, patterns depend on the water clarity and forage. I've also been slow retrieving a black/blue spinner bait worked against the current, just below the surface.  None above 30"" yet for me though, but these patterns have been producing"
