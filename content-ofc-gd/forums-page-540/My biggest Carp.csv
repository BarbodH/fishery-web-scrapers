I had the line in the water around 2:30 and by 3pm I had a fish on I knew it was a good one to as it nearly took all my line off the spool in the first run, I managed to keep it in before getting to the end of my line thank god. Well after that he didn't fight to good so I was sure how big he was until I got him near shore and then again there he goes not the whole line but a good amount after that fight he was tired out I think and came in fairly easy but it was a monster(at least to me). I have been carp fishing two times and this being the second in the 2 days of targeting them I have landed my PB carp lol, not only is he my personal best but the biggest fish I have ever caught. Got the heart going really good but well worth it in my eyes.  Heres a pic of the monster that was 37.5 inches long and 28.13 lbs.    That doesn't really show the true size of the fish so here is another 2 pictures.      All in all it was a slower day then the first that being the only one I caught, I had 3 on one snapped the line on the leader and the other just got off. I know they are Ugly looking and invasive but well worth fishing for them they give a darn good fight. Hope I will have a bigger one and some more pics soon.  Chris."
