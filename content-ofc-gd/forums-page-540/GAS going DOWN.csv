581854,Fish Farmer,2011-05-11 22:43:00,2234,"Were suppose to feel better, 6 cents. Man, do they think were stupid. 80 cents wouldn't be asking to much. The media has already told them to put it up for the weekend."

581861,Guest gbfisher,2011-05-11 23:21:00,0,   If you had status that might work but you still pay tax man. Unless you have friends.  There's nothing you can do about it. Well I guess complaining is something. They should bring back the Moped.
581866,glen,2011-05-11 23:33:00,2641,My new to me car is not that great on gas but boy does it look cool.
581874,Terry,2011-05-12 00:07:00,14456,"Moped, yeah they were ,,interesting.........  I am real glad I have a diesel now 15 cents a liter less then gas prices"
581887,Rich Clemens,2011-05-12 00:39:00,3131,"Funny how gas drops down my way.  $3.95 this morning and $4.09 this evening.  UNBELIEVABLE.   Glad my neighbor said he saw one station at $4.09 and the others still at $3.95.  So, a quick trip to the gas station before the others raised there.  93 bucks later - full tank."
