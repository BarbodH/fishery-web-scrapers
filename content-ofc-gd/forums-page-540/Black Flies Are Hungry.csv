582445,johnnyb,2011-05-13 13:47:00,3413,Good to know.... I wonder if Temagami will still be safe for the long weekend?  
582447,fishindevil,2011-05-13 13:55:00,6254,"we have some at sturgeon lake right now,and was talking to a guy in west haliburton yesterday he said they are very bad right now!!! so by next weekend they will be deadly!! i already have been bit several times just having a beer on the deck.....i hate them soooo much,and ya the skeeters are out too...."
582448,Muskieman,2011-05-13 13:55:00,2472, Don't count on it....  They were fierce here last night and are out this morning too... Temagami is just 50 minutes north of here...  Being a blood donor is a small price to pay for a weekend of fishing.  Randy

582466,4x4bassin,2011-05-13 14:36:00,1025,I found that when the sun was out they were deadly and when it was cloudy not so bad . So this is the only time I am wishing for a cool/light drizzle and a bit of wind for my lake trout trip next weekend. I do agree that if it is sunny and warm next week they will be at there peak by the long weekend !
582467,johnnyb,2011-05-13 14:38:00,3413,"  OH, well then I will be packing the bug repellant for sure.  Fine Cuban hand-rolled bug repellant  :D"
582479,Rich Clemens,2011-05-13 15:04:00,3131,Just heard from Kevin/Leslie yesterday and they're coming out up there.
582486,discophish,2011-05-13 15:27:00,392,"Ugg - you had to say the ""B"" word ...didn't you!  And sourced from Parry Sound ... g-r-e-a-t.  I was up last weekend and there were a couple around already at that time, the odd one or two.  Come next weekend I'm wearing my space suit with an O2 tank and all.  Houston ... we've got a problem"
582510,g_clot,2011-05-13 17:11:00,104,Is Off Deep Wood Sportsman the repellant of choice?
582516,Rizzo,2011-05-13 17:29:00,4754,"yup, its that time of year when you drink a ""filtered"" beer...filtered by the bug net that's over your head. It works great drinking straight through the screen"
582524,irishfield,2011-05-13 17:42:00,26272,"John.. they always come out Friday at noon for the long weekend. You can see them in a swarm, helping the PPark warden unlocking the gate to the campground!"
582533,aplumma,2011-05-13 17:53:00,6896,Time to ask your best friend state side to bring you a few 100 deet.    Art
582537,craigdritchie,2011-05-13 18:04:00,1586,With all the rain we've had this spring (and will continue to get over the weekend) it's going to be a really bad year for the little vampires.
582539,Handlebarz,2011-05-13 18:06:00,3790,Art I agree with you on that but I am a whimp and only 98.9% Maxx Deet that 100% stuff is not good for ya
582540,aplumma,2011-05-13 18:09:00,6896, If you drink it slower you can handle the 100%   Art
