581493,Michael_Brown,2011-05-10 21:22:00,411,"I will be at Rice Lake trying to give away over $69,000 in prizes.  http://www.ricelakespringfishingfestival.ca/  The panfish bite was hot this past weekend and the walleye seem to be everywhere. This is going to be a very good weekend for fishing Rice Lake.  Harrison bring some pain medicine, those big Rice Lake walleyes will try to rip your arms off if you keep jerking that bait.  Find a weedline in 6-10 feet of water, throw a jig or crankbait and hold on.  "

582465,ehg,2011-05-13 14:33:00,2666,"So walleye will open in FMZ 17(Kawarthas) at midnght tonight. I would check the regs before going. There were new limits that started last year. Walleye have to be between 35-50 cm(13.8-19.7in.)to be kept. With a conservation license only one can be kept, 4 can be kept with sport license.  That really lessens the amount of fish kept. Balsam has different regs where fish between 37-55 cm. can't be kept. Only one can be kept with conservation license, 3 can be kept with sport. Rather confusing but should be followed as CO's are checking. In years past i would have a run on Pigeon Lake that was decent. Walleye opener always seemed rainy and cool like it is this weekend. Always was a good time anyways."
582650,ehg,2011-05-13 23:31:00,2666,"4 and half hours until walleye opens in the Kawarthas. With a conservation license one smallish ""wet sock"" can be kept"
582652,GBW,2011-05-13 23:37:00,8460,"Sin, want to hook up?  My day tomorrow is pooched so right now I'm just relaxing with a beer, the Mrs and the kids.  how long are you going to stay out tonight?"
