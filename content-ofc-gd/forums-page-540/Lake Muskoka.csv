I grew up in Gravenhurst but I only ever fished bass and I don't really know any spots for pike any help would be appreciated.  Also does anyone no a site that gives the water temp for lake Muskoka."
580967,bigbuck,2011-05-09 14:03:00,2449,Any shallow weedy bay in that lake should produce. Look at a chart of the lake and go for it.

581928,camillj,2011-05-12 03:45:00,1988,Always saw some MONSTERS each spring in the bay near the resort just south of Glen Orchard ... I think it was called Enricos for a while .. anyhow .. you can actually fish it right off shore from Hwy 169 about half way down to Bala ... fish near the culverts into the swamp...not big numbers .. but some big snakes for sure !

We've never even bothered to leave Gravenhurst Bay because we were in a pretty small boat and were catching some decent fish right there. Not the giants you may get elsewhere, but we caught pike up to 35 inches just fishing weedy drop-offs and flats"

582433,Rizzo,2011-05-13 12:59:00,4754,"...up to 35 inches...most we got were your typical hammerhandles, but every once in a while got a decent one"
