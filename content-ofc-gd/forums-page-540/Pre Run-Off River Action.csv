581942,Jet,2011-05-12 06:52:00,364,The mountains here are still covered in snow and the big run-off here in the Kootenays is late. So fishing has been slower than I expect but still some some good times on the river. Wanted to share a few pics of my last couple of trips. The Bull Trout action has been slow but the Cutthroat bite has been pretty great. Too bad they don't get bigger here because they put up a great fight. Enjoy!                      Even my sister got in on the action with her first Bull Trout. Put up a great fight. She just might get into this crazy sport!     Cheers!
