Together with my buddies Cas and Robert and with Jon Bondy, an well know professional angler from Windsor area, we had a blast on Saturday may 7. Weather was awesome,sunny and 18 C, no wind from early morning to mid afternoon. We had continuous action from early as 7:00 am until way pas mid day. We where targeting walleye and we had an fantastic day..16 walleye in less then 8 hours. We where jigging in 15-25 ft of water, with strong current but we had Jon as a guide and his jigging technique for rivers worked awesome. This guy really know what he's doing. Thank you Jon Bondy for an awesome day of fishing!  http://i633.photobucket.com/albums/uu58/gino197/Detroit%20river%20walleye%20may%202011/DSC01284.jpg http://i633.photobucket.com/albums/uu58/gino197/Detroit%20river%20walleye%20may%202011/DSC01300.jpg http://i633.photobucket.com/albums/uu58/gino197/Detroit%20river%20walleye%20may%202011/DSC01301.jpg http://i633.photobucket.com/albums/uu58/gino197/Detroit%20river%20walleye%20may%202011/DSC01307.jpg http://i633.photobucket.com/albums/uu58/gino197/Detroit%20river%20walleye%20may%202011/DSC01308.jpg http://i633.photobucket.com/albums/uu58/gino197/Detroit%20river%20walleye%20may%202011/DSC01314.jpg http://i633.photobucket.com/albums/uu58/gino197/Detroit%20river%20walleye%20may%202011/DSC01315.jpg http://i633.photobucket.com/albums/uu58/gino197/Detroit%20river%20walleye%20may%202011/DSC01321.jpg http://i633.photobucket.com/albums/uu58/gino197/Detroit%20river%20walleye%20may%202011/DSC01322.jpg"
