Threw the fish in the livewell as always in the spring and brought them home alive....but after removing them and the overfill pipe that drains my livewell there was a LOT of ""stuff"" on the bottom of my livewell....I just thought excretions from the fish....so I grabbed my trusting garden hose to flush the ""stuff"" out...but on further review I noticed that they were actually small pieces of zebra mussel shells....anyone else experience this ???  I know down south they call some of their sunfish ""shell crackers""....maybe this is why..."
