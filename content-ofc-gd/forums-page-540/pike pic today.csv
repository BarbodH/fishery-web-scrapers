581914,beginner,2011-05-12 02:45:00,542,After I finish work today I decided to try pike fishing...

I dont know how to post pic like you guys and girls do...        
581918,NAW,2011-05-12 02:54:00,4022,"Where were you fishing for Pike?  Nice catch!  But if your cell phone died, how did you get pictures of the pike in the water   Or are those pictures of the smaller ones?  Looks like fun man.  Heading out this weekend for openner!  I can't wait  Posting the images from Photobucket is a sinch.. Instead of copying and pasting the link like you did.  Copy and past the IMG code..  The pictures will show up, instead of a link to photobucket.  ( think that's how..  It's been a while.)"
581920,beginner,2011-05-12 02:57:00,542, lake O took that pic before it died my phone... then after that I had the big guy but phone already dead   thnx for the tips N.A.W I finally did the picture right..
581921,jediangler,2011-05-12 02:59:00,1923,"Nice catch. Gotta love the rapalas.  I think he means his cellphone's battery died after taking pics of the little ones, so when he caught the big one he couldn't take a pic. I can't fish for pike yet as our season doesn't open till this weekend."

582145,jimmer,2011-05-12 19:54:00,2730,"Why don't you eat them? They are great once you learn how to clean them, especially in the cold water. There are many youtube videos to show you how."
582198,beginner,2011-05-12 23:07:00,542,went again today for more pikey..
