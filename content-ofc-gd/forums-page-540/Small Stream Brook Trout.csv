581276,jjcanoe,2011-05-10 04:00:00,744,"Well I got away on Saturday to do some brook trout fishing, I had to go solo since my usual partner decided he needed to see Larry the Cable guy at the JLC. So after working a 16.5hour day on Friday, I quickly drove home showered and tossed my gear in the truck.... a brief 2.5 hour drive got me to the side of the river where I was planning on fishing in the morning, parked the truck around midnight and tried to get some shut-eye, after laying down for 6 hours I might have managed 3hours or so of decent sleep........my alarm woke me up at 6am.  After I crawled out of my sleeping bag I popped the cover on the truck bed and put on my boots, (no waders required at this spot) already had my rod set up, reached for my vest, uh it must be under my waders.....ok maybe I tossed it in the back seat..... nope.......D'OH!!!!!!!!!!! still on the hook in the garage well I still had one spinner rigged up on my rod, and my fly rod as a backup, a few casts later, and nothing...... Headed back to the car and fired up the blackberry Canadian tire app..... nearest one was about 34 kms away and didn't open til 8am.. drove to the lakefront cottage my uncle rents for the weekend and at least had myself a good breakfast  off to CTC for gas and gear, (on the plus side gas was 131.9.... 2cents cheaper than anywhere else I saw) $30 later I was geared up and ready to roll.  second cast on the stream and WHAM! a nice 9""er  not bad for walking about 50 yards from the parking lot!  working my way upstream to a few spots where I did well on the opener and last year I got the big donut! (where are all the fishies?)  Got to my ""go to"" spot and on the first cast I saw a big flash and set the hook! 2 seconds later, snap! :yikes  big fish grabbed it and once it realized it was hooked turned and snapped me off with a shake of it's head,  4lb flouro line! Quicky re-tied with another spinner and on the second cast I had another nice one follow and watched it bump my spinner twice without taking it. I couldn't feel it hit but really wished I had a bit of worm on the hook, That would have made the difference for sure. Worked the pool for another hour and threw everything in my limited arsenal at the water and only saw one other fish (also with lockjaw)  Packed up and left the hole, for sure I would get them biting on the way back..... Next small pool upstream I managed 2 little guys around 7"" or so   headed upstream again and hit a few other pools that produced well for me last year but it was not to be this time.  Next pool I remembered from last year, I didn't get one last year but I did turn a few, so I figured I'd give it a shot..  2nd cast in another break off on a fish (maybe time to switch back to Mono for the extra stretch)  4th cast, Fish On!! and a big one! got it in with no probs(PHEW!!!) and wished I had my tape measure with me since It's one of the biggest trout I've ever caught out of this stream      got to play with my new camera as well but it's kind of tough to hold it with one hand and keep the fish steady and make sure it's in the shot, while trying to revive it at the same time!       after that I went up one more pool but I really didn't care if I got another, that was the last fish of the day and I felt like the day was a success!  jjcanoe"
581290,pikehunter,2011-05-10 10:45:00,1659,Nice pictures. Reminds me of a time when I was young. My father and I came across a tiny creek off a Muskoka gravel road. The stream was no more than 2 feet wide and it was full of speckles. It was a great afternoon. Thanks for taking the time to post.
581323,splashhopper,2011-05-10 12:38:00,2931,Good on u John. I heard from our buddy that the cable guy sucked! Gonna suck even more when he sees this post !  Lol
581340,fish_finder,2011-05-10 13:25:00,370,Good stuff JJ! The season has only just begun!
581360,johnnyb,2011-05-10 14:24:00,3413,"Can't beat that....looks like a great day.  In that first pic....are you just messing with us, or did you really tie a panther martin onto your flyrod?  "
581368,torco,2011-05-10 14:44:00,656,Great report.
581375,Basskicker,2011-05-10 14:51:00,421,I really enjoyed the underwater pics!!!
581388,asdve23rveavwa,2011-05-10 15:23:00,2690,"Love seeing the small stream ""speck"" reports.  Something I used to do all the time with my dad, but, haven't done in way too many years. Nice going"
581392,fish_finder,2011-05-10 15:27:00,370, Looks like a fly still stuck in the hook keeper.  The rod is probably there for size comparison
581394,Leecher,2011-05-10 15:34:00,7832,Nicely done jj    Congrats on your biggest... she's a real beaut
581395,redskullz,2011-05-10 15:37:00,55,"NIce brookies! I love small stream fishing for resident brookies, bows and especially browns. Nothing like nailing a dozen trout in an afternoon and having a deer walk within 10 feet from you."
581415,johnnyb,2011-05-10 16:47:00,3413,"  Good call -- I missed that the first time....now I see it...along with the spinning rod in the bottom of the pic  ""Upon closer inspection....these are loafers"""
581422,Jds63,2011-05-10 17:00:00,1365,very nice  .... love those stream specks ... nice underwater shot
581427,Joeytier,2011-05-10 17:17:00,3990,It's definitely a small panther martin with an orange fly on the treble.  I have the same one sitting on my desk in front of me.  Beautiful fish!
581429,GreenCanada,2011-05-10 17:41:00,375,"Those speck's look great! Thanks for sharing the photos, especially the underwater ones. Have fun with the new toy!"
581435,ehg,2011-05-10 17:51:00,2666,My favourite type of fishing That last fat brookie and the underwater pictures are impressive.  Thanks for posting!
581461,ctranter,2011-05-10 20:02:00,543,"I love those underwater shots, thanks for the report!!"
581531,jjcanoe,2011-05-10 23:03:00,744," LOL the flyrod was just for scale, and happened to be it the pic, got them all on my spinning reel!"
581823,Jacob,2011-05-11 20:57:00,186,Great pics!
581829,Familyfisherman,2011-05-11 21:19:00,188,"Some great pics there, thanks for sharing those!  I live here in Barrie -- pretty much in the center of town.  In the evenings my kids and I will walk 50 yards into the woods behind our home and catch specs -- biggest is 14 inches so far, but most are 8-10 inches...I say that cause I feel guilty that you're driving 2.5 hours and sleeping (poorly) in your truck to catch similar fish...although I do understand the remoteness and quiet is certainly a benefit.  Again, great pics of some gorgeous fish."
581832,jjcanoe,2011-05-11 21:23:00,744,"LOL!! no need to worry, there's plenty within a 20 min drive of me here in and around London but just not as many or as big."
581833,splashhopper,2011-05-11 21:25:00,2931,  hmmmmm  ????
582084,lhousesoccer,2011-05-12 17:53:00,442,Nice brookies!  What kind of camera do you have?
582202,Musky or Specks,2011-05-12 23:17:00,2710,Nice Brookie Thats got me pumped for my two weeks fishing up in the Nakina area.
582936,MJL,2011-05-14 23:21:00,2427,"One of my favourite reports of the season so far - Really nice stream specks   .  You're not the only one to forget a vest at home...like you, driving 20km to the nearest CTC for supplies was my best option...Both times"
