Had a lot of fish on the topwaters, some even made it in the boat.  We fished near lilly pads so that Ryan could catch some panfish.        The slop frogs worked better then the zaras because of the thicker weeds, but they were all small bass.  Then, there it was. The perfect spot. A tree over hanging the water. Another in the water. Lilly pads everywhere, but there is a hole in the lilly pads beside a big old stump. I zing a cast right for ""the hole""... and miss by almost 10 feet. The ""big bass"" didn't care. The one pound bass made a 5lb hole in the water.    And that swim?    Uncle and dad went, Ryan changed his mind.   "
