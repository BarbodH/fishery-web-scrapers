Just trying to figure out where to go on Saturday weather permitting of course! (I'd settle for somewhere other than there but I know the girlfriends dad is set on somewhere to try and pull out some salmon)  if anyone has some insight it'd be greatly appreciated!"
862426,BillM,2014-07-09 23:16:00,17367,I'm having deja vu..  There's another thread a few down with the exact same questions.
862433,leaf4,2014-07-09 23:29:00,2466,is that what bluffers is? never heard it referred to as that.

862440,leaf4,2014-07-09 23:38:00,2466,"Ah, learn something new everyday then! Still a ways away from Jordan harbour in niagara region, I'll probably try and talk him into Lake Erie bass & walleye lol"
862441,BillM,2014-07-09 23:43:00,17367,Did you get out this spring on the southern shore?  We had some slammers out there early in the season.
862442,leaf4,2014-07-09 23:54:00,2466,"Only been able to manage a handful of times this season out in the boat thus far and nothing really to write home about, lots of boats trolling, marking but not catching so I was beginning to wonder if it was us, the spot or any other sort of superstitious occurrence haha"
