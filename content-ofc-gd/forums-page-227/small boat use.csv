862037,FISHEYEZ,2014-07-08 00:03:00,49,"Hey everyone, so I was given a nice 9.9hp motor (freshly tuned-up) and bought a 14' aluminum boat. I have had my pleasure craft operators card for years, with a fair bit of experience. Anyway, after reading a bit of info, am I correct that I can put the boat in the water without registration/licensing? Without any identifying numbers? Thanks"
862046,Rich Clemens,2014-07-08 00:19:00,3131,"Not sure of the regs in Ontario, but here in PA, a boat that size, with gas motor, must be licensed and registered - registration numbers clearly visible."
862047,DRIFTER_016,2014-07-08 00:20:00,10439,I believe you are correct. If I remember correctly anything over 10hp needs to be registered in Ontario.  I know my first boat (12' with 5.5 didn't need to be)
862048,BillM,2014-07-08 00:21:00,17367,Anything under 10hp doesn't need to be registered.
862049,DRIFTER_016,2014-07-08 00:24:00,10439,Anything under 10hp doesn't need to be registered. Does that mean anything over 10hp needs to be registered?
862053,Fisherman,2014-07-08 00:36:00,7201,"Does that mean anything over 10hp needs to be registered? Ah, don't do it..they'll take your sparkplugs and make you row home.."
862055,Joeytier,2014-07-08 00:45:00,3990,"Oh, thats why 10 hp outboards dont exist . The more you know"
862130,AdamS,2014-07-08 14:00:00,161,"yes, you are correct based on this page.  https://www.tc.gc.ca/eng/marinesafety/debs-obs-paperwork-paperwork_boat_licence-1898.htm Just make sure you have the proper safety equipment."
