861586,Tim Mills,2014-07-04 14:56:00,476,I've got a friend is visiting TO from out of town who is looking to play 18 holes on a GTA course.  He is staying in Leaside.  He is looking to pay around $100 and play on Sunday.  Any courses you would reccommend in and around the GTA?  
861590,ketchenany,2014-07-04 15:32:00,3229,Check out cardinalgolfclub.com they have good rates.  Hwy 9 east of the 400
861591,quickme,2014-07-04 15:48:00,261,Ballantrae ( not maples of ballantrae)  would be a good place to play.  hwy 48 and just north of St. John's sideroad.

861709,Canuck,2014-07-05 12:15:00,491,"Right in the City the Don Valley Golf Course is a pretty nice course for a city owned course.  Its slow play though and you probably cant get a tee time on short notice, but he could try if he is a single."
861744,John Bacon,2014-07-05 20:58:00,3277,I am pretty sure that Parkview north east of Markham and Steels is public.  I am not a golfer so I cannot tell you if it is a good course or not.
861748,lew,2014-07-05 21:09:00,12766,I am pretty sure that Parkview north east of Markham and Steels is public.  I was probably the worlds worst golfer but Parkview was the course where I broke 100 for the one & only time in my entire pitiful golfing career.
861752,Old Ironmaker,2014-07-05 22:15:00,8243,"I would recommend Cardinal in Newmarket if that's consider GTA. You can easily play it to your own handicap with 3 18's I believe and more than 3 t blocks.  There are many, many good courses fro $100.00 around T.O. If a trip to Niagara is in the plans you can't swing a cat without hitting a great course for under $100.00. Also good courses around Ancaster and I highly recommend Carlisle."

When was that?  Did you drop by the fish hatchery that operated there from the nineties to about 2005 or so?
861778,bigmac1984,2014-07-06 02:29:00,193,"golfnow.com or underpar.com and then search the area you want... lots of great last minute deals on there, especially in the GTA."
861788,woodenboater,2014-07-06 04:02:00,2277,This is super close to Leaside but it's only 9 holes. Never golfed there but have walked it and it's not bad for something central.  http://www.flemingdonparkgolfclub.com
