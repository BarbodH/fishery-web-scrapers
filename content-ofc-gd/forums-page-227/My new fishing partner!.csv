861397,Gerritt,2014-07-03 02:16:00,6129,"After a ton of turmoil and a boatload of bad choices... I have had enough living a life of regrets...  During my downfall I pissed a lot of folks off... Including some of my friends here.  I won't get into details... But some have forgiven me.. Some have not.  For that I am sorry.  But given the fact I was at my bottom there was no where to go but up! I got some help, the professional kind.... And dealt with some the demons that have been haunting me.  Anyways, I remarried last June, to a great woman that was willing to take the time and over look my flaws that were caused by circumstance and the cards dealt to me.  Today I would like to introduce you to Crawford. Our son and little brother to Liam and the late Terrance.  There could not be a man happier on the planet right now as I am. From dangerous thoughts less then three years ago, to therapy, to family, marriage and now this!  I really think someone up there is looking out for me.  I have a lot to be thankful for.  Welcome, Crawford Philip Arno Aalbers to the OFC Family...      Mom and baby are doing just fine.  G."
