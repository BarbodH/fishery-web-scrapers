862000,Garnet,2014-07-07 21:47:00,2056,Turn unit on and get your hand on xduser. You will feel it clicking if it's working.
862004,landry,2014-07-07 21:56:00,1005,Those hybrid ducers often cause a rooster tail. If it is in the water and clicking it is likely okay. Check the settings on your unit.
862011,mercforever,2014-07-07 22:16:00,67,"will it click in the garage or only in the water,just turned it on in the garage ,nothing"
862013,BillM,2014-07-07 22:25:00,17367,"It will click anytime the unit is on, in the water or out it doesn't matter.   You sure you have the transducer cable installed correctly into the head at the unit attaches to?   What model is this?"
862017,mercforever,2014-07-07 22:32:00,67,"597di,been fishing last  couple of weeks with the electric up front,almost 100%sure the thing worked,gonna check the connections and possibly drop  it the water tonite,wont be able to start big motor"
862018,Roy,2014-07-07 22:33:00,13728,A picture would help.

862074,BillM,2014-07-08 01:42:00,17367,"Yelling at the BPS staff isn't going to help you... You need to deal directly with Humminbird.  Unless this unit is brand brand new, then just return it and exchange it for another."
862090,mercforever,2014-07-08 03:23:00,67,"bought it at the classic this spring,tried it out on the weekend,not so easy to take out,"
862092,porkpie,2014-07-08 03:45:00,2521,Call the service centre in North Bay.  Your transducer is likely pooched!  Thy have pretty good service and you'll be back in business relatively quickly.
862100,Old Ironmaker,2014-07-08 07:34:00,8243,"Hummingbird has always been good to deal with for me. Giving an earful to anyone will never get you good service. You get to someone who isn't offshore. Just recently it took me 15 minutes to give a young lady offshore my email address. I have a 3 foot rooster tail on one of my unit, reminds me to lower it 1/2"".  It's never fun to have to deal with any service person. Just yesterday I said to my wife I can't wait for the day I buy something and it actually works. Can you imagine having a job where every time the phone rings you know there is someone on the other line pissed, every phone call. And minimum or a poor wage at least. I usually start off by talking to the person about anything but my problem in a tone that they know I won't be combative. Doesn't work with the offshore guys, they think I'm nuts.Man I've received a lot of free stuff I didn't ask for on a warranty issue. Even an upgrade from a 5 series Hummingbird to a 7 series without asking. Once on a BBQ new grills, thermometer, drip pan and I needed a handle that cracked. Plus they sent me not 1 but 2 handles."
862207,mercforever,2014-07-08 20:35:00,67,basspro to radio world to bass pro to hummingbird usa to hummingbird ca to north bay.i wish basspro would of sent to north bay.hopefully ill get my new one by  the weekend.thanks for your input
