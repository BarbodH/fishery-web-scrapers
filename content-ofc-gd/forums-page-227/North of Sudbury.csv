I was wondering if anyone would be kind enough to share some fishing tips as I haven't been up there much. I'm not looking for anyone's honey hole, just a place with easier access where I can catch a few Pike and/or bass. I fish from a canoe mostly, so maybe some smaller lakes that aren't as well known?  Thanks in advance! JW"

Its been almost 20 years since I have lived up there but will give you the best advice. Go to Ramakkoâ€™s Tackle world when I knew it but now its ""Source for Adventure"" The guys there will put you on spots and you will catch everything you need http://www.ramakkos.com/"
