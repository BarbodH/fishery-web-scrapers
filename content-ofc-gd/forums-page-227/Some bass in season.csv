My brother got all of his on the zara and I caught 2 really small bass on a jitterbug. I forced myself to use a spinnerbait anytime I put the topwater down. My brother fished that hot opener and had all ready caught a handful of bass before me so his fish don't rank as high as mine, no matter how nice they might be.    First bass of the season for me.         Action shot   Last of the day before picking up the kids  "
861678,BillM,2014-07-04 23:53:00,17367,My oldman throws a Zara Spook probably 90% of the time    Nice fish!  That smallie is a tank.
861681,Pikeslayer,2014-07-05 00:20:00,1443,That Zara is killer for me too when hunting bass (rarely). Looks like your brother smoked ya Rob
861703,misfish,2014-07-05 08:26:00,29133,Some nice fish there Rob. I already have one tied up for today.
861716,Sinker,2014-07-05 13:50:00,8692,Spooks and torpedos are all I throw at bass......but I rarely fish them. looks like a fun day!  S.

861723,Roy,2014-07-05 15:30:00,13728,"Looks like a really nice day for you guys. Sunshine and topwater bass.  Maybe Jim knows something about this. I don't fish bass very often but when I do, top water is what I like. I have a bunch of spooks...small, large, old and new. I'm finding that the newer ones have a tendency to take on water enough that after 3-4 casts the bait won't float high enough and will no longer 'walk'. Is he getting that too? The older ones that I have are still flawless after many years of use. I can probably fix the problem with a little epoxy in the right place but I hate repairing new, out of the box baits."
861726,kickingfrog,2014-07-05 16:00:00,8333,"I don't know how new his are? The one he uses the most is ""newer"" (the one in these photos) and is a super spook I think but it might be 5 years old.  As far as I know he's never had one take on water. He has caught a lot of pike on it as well."
861740,Sinker,2014-07-05 19:17:00,8692,"Ive never had that problem either, Roy....  S."
861746,lew,2014-07-05 21:04:00,12766,Always enjoy reading your fishing tales about when you and your brother get out together Rob.
861754,Lape0019,2014-07-05 22:27:00,647,"Nice fish!  If you like the Zara, try the new Duo Realis Pencil 110. It is a little thinner but makes a lot of noise. I have caught some nice bass and pike on it. Also had a musky jump straight out of the water and miss. My heart skipped a beat when that happened!"
861765,BillM,2014-07-06 00:06:00,17367,"I love the Duo Realis Pencil 110's as well, killer killer topwater.  Sit nice and low in the rear as well, feathered hook is the ticket!"
861771,ccmtcanada,2014-07-06 00:51:00,7971,Nothing wrong with that kind of day!  Nice going guys!
861772,kickingfrog,2014-07-06 01:05:00,8333,"Three boys in the boat Sunday morning, my son will be joining us."
