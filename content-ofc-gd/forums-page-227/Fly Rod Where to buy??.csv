861781,bassjnkie,2014-07-06 02:50:00,1101,I'm looking for a 2wt fly combo.. BUT I can't seem to find a store that carries it.. Looks like 4wt is the lightest.. Where should I check??  Any help is appreciated..
861785,BillM,2014-07-06 03:25:00,17367,"2wt is pretty light, what do you plan on using it for?    Even small stream resident trout will put quite the bend in my 9ft 4wt."
861787,bassjnkie,2014-07-06 03:39:00,1101,Sorry I should have mentioned its stictly for pan fish..
861789,DRIFTER_016,2014-07-06 04:06:00,10439,I got my 2wt from Cabelas. It's one of their PT blanks. Nice rod & reasonable price. If you're looking for a good rod I'm sure any of the good fly shops can get to a Sage or other brand. I bought mine to use on the pond trout that I stocked out back of my place when I lived in Ontario. Caught rainbows to 6#'s on it. Unfortunately they no longer make them but there are other choices that are reasonably priced.  http://www.cabelas.com/product/Fishing/Fly-Fishing/Fly-Fishing-Rods%7C/pc/104793480/c/104721480/sc/105573780/Cabelas-TQR-Fly-Rods/712113.uts?destination=%2Fcatalog%2Fbrowse%2Ffly-fishing-rods%2F_%2FN-1102568%2FNs-CATEGORY_SEQ_105573780%3FWTz_l%3DSBC%253BMMcat104793480%253Bcat104721480&WTz_l=SBC%3BMMcat104793480%3Bcat104721480%3Bcat105573780#productChart  http://www.cabelas.com/product/Fishing/Fly-Fishing/Fly-Fishing-Rods%7C/pc/104793480/c/104721480/sc/105573780/TFO-Lefty-Kreh-Finesse-Fly-Rods/710839.uts?destination=%2Fcatalog%2Fbrowse%2Ffly-fishing-rods%2F_%2FN-1102568%2FNs-CATEGORY_SEQ_105573780%3FWTz_l%3DSBC%253BMMcat104793480%253Bcat104721480&WTz_l=SBC%3BMMcat104793480%3Bcat104721480%3Bcat105573780#productChart  http://www.cabelas.com/product/Fishing/Fly-Fishing/Fly-Fishing-Rods%7C/pc/104793480/c/104721480/sc/105573780/TFO-Lefty-Kreh-Signature-II-Fly-Rods/1309656.uts?destination=%2Fcatalog%2Fbrowse%2Ffly-fishing-rods%2F_%2FN-1102568%2FNs-CATEGORY_SEQ_105573780%3FWTz_l%3DSBC%253BMMcat104793480%253Bcat104721480&WTz_l=SBC%3BMMcat104793480%3Bcat104721480%3Bcat105573780#productChart  http://www.cabelas.com/product/Fishing/Fly-Fishing/Fly-Fishing-Rods%7C/pc/104793480/c/104721480/sc/105573780/Echo-Carbon-Fly-Rod/1570859.uts?destination=%2Fcatalog%2Fbrowse%2Ffly-fishing-rods%2F_%2FN-1102568%2FNs-CATEGORY_SEQ_105573780%3FWTz_l%3DSBC%253BMMcat104793480%253Bcat104721480&WTz_l=SBC%3BMMcat104793480%3Bcat104721480%3Bcat105573780#productChart
861802,dave524,2014-07-06 11:58:00,4508,"My panfishing uses some pretty wind resistant flies like deer hair and foam poppers, I'd hate to try and cast some of that stuff with a 2 wt. line. To a certain point you need to match the rod to the flies beiing throw and not the size of the quarry."
861805,Christopheraaron,2014-07-06 12:40:00,3525,"I think I have recommended the rod on every forum I'm a part of now and I'll do it again, the 2wt butterstick is an amazing rod, I've handled 14"" brookies on it no problem and can chuck and duck trout streamers all day with it if need be. It's an amazing dry fly rod, because it's fibreglass even if you try to smack the line down on the water you'll get a gentler presentation than any 4wt can give you. If you ever want to test cast mine let me know!"

To a certain point you need to match the rod to the flies beiing throw and not the size of the quarry. This is a very good point. My 2wt is used for fishing tiny dries on smooth water. Size 18 and below. IMHO a 2wt is more about the presentation than the size of the fish. For instance largemouth rarely get above five pounds but I use a ten weight IMX to fish them cuz I like to toss big hair frogs into the slop."
