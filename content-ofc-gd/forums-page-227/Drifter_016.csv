It was @ a hydro dam a couple of miles away. Seems a raven landed on one of the transformers got fried, burst into flames and ignighted the forest!!! The smoke has been thick all summer here. Woest I have seen since 1999.  The view here in YK this evening.   Over 1,700 square miles of the NWT has burnt so far this summer.  Fire Map http://www.nwtfire.com/cms/nwt-fire-map"
