Now I'm involved in a case with a CA,the MNR and the DFO with a species at risk situation. My question, keeping in mind that I'm a luddite, involves a PDF. I have been sent a map to mark up and show where the changes have taken place. Is there a way to do this on my computer or do I have to print it off,mark it accordingly and rescan it before its emailed off.  Here's the spot     Everything to the left in the video has been destroyed and plowed/cleared right down to the bank as well as a dock that now sits halfway out into the pool.  It's disappointing to say the least but for those who know me I don't get to worked up about poaching because fish can always reproduce if the habitat is there but habitat destruction burns my butt and I won't stand for it so something had o be done. I didn't take any after photos because the perps were there and I didn't want to start a confrontation. "

862029,BillM,2014-07-07 23:30:00,17367,"MNR will make them tear it up and pay for the restoration of the stream bank (Or at least I hope)  Some idiot did some work on the upper Notty without a permit either... Cleared cut a whole section, MNR was not pleased..  Now he's in big crap."

If you have Windows 7 or 8 you can use the snipping tool to do a screen capture."

Hate to be a pain."

The only thing now is I don't feel comfortable accessing this spot anymore as my vehicle is a good distance away in a very secluded spot at the end of a road allowance. Oh well let the furor die down and go back in a couple years I guess.
