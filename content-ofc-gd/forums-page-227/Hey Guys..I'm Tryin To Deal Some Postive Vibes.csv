(just east of Barry's Bay)---so a couple months ago he calls me up after seeing one of my ads and inquires about takin some of my Ced-Art works in his store on consignment.  So like many places it's been dead---today I picked up my stuff because I'm takin it to the road--anyway that's not the story.  This guy is like many of us----middle aged guy moves north to get away from the nuthouse and try to cut out a livin (how many here have dreamed of this?)  Now this person is trying real hard and he just needs to get folks in the door ------he's got a great gift shop with some unique things--and people just drive by??  I think he's feeling a little disillusioned about this venture---so I thought I'd throw this out there  If your up in Cottage country and drivin thru Wilno---and the wife is lookin for a quaint shop--maybe you can try it out  It's called ""Canoe Creek""---got a yellow canoe in front of store ---it's right on hwy 60 in Wilno---they even have Mennonite furniture  Now if this guy was'nt tryin at all---I would'nt give this a 2nd thought---but I'd hate to see a guy in need and not try and lend a hand---especially when he's tryin to help himself  I truly can respect the courage it takes to make this leap into business..  Again I have zero ties with this  Thanks"

861845,bushart,2014-07-06 21:32:00,2628,Thanks Lew  No it's across hwy 60---just a bit up the hill---think it used to be the red canoe cafe
861846,lew,2014-07-06 21:42:00,12766,"Yeah, I know the place your talking about now, about 1/4 mile east of the tavern. It's a beautiful part of Ontario and my Mom is from Killaloe just a few miles east of Wilno."
861850,bushart,2014-07-06 21:57:00,2628,Uh...Hey Lew---u sure we're not related----My clan is from this area
861851,lew,2014-07-06 22:30:00,12766,"Mom's folks worked as cooks in the bush camps in the area in the early 1900's, then built a hotel beside the rail line up in Chapleau. It burned down around 1918 and they moved to Killaloe where the rest of the family already lived.  This is the hotel in 1917.  My grandfather is wearing the white shirt, grandma is sitting in the chair holding my uncle Leonard and the little girl is my Aunt Mable. Mom came along in 1922.  "
861854,glen,2014-07-06 22:49:00,2641,Look at that sign.  The place had a pool.  Wow. Nice pic Lew.
861857,bushart,2014-07-06 23:02:00,2628,Cool  My mother was born in 21 in this area  my uncles used to work those logging camps  How did they end up in Chapleau??...long way from killaloe  ok here's a true story...somewhat of a family legend...and likely the basis for many jokes  My Grandfather's brother.....decided one day (likely in the 30's) that he was gonna walk thru the bush---to killaloe and grab a bottle (red root is the lore) now that's a good hoof---likely a 3-4 hour walk  So he makes it-----gets about 100yds from home---falls and breaks the jug  and we're still talkin bout it today
