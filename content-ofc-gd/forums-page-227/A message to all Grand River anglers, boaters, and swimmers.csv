The links will take you to a Grand River angling, boating, or swimming survey.  These surveys are part of ongoing work to manage water quality in the Grand River watershed and to protect the valuable ecosystem services that it provides. Completing the survey will take roughly 10 minutes.These surveys are being conducted by DSS Management Consultants Inc. and are designed to estimate the types, level and distribution of angling, boating, and swimming and their economic value within the Grand River watershed.  Your responses will help watershed managers to make prudent future decisions that will sustain angling, boating, and swimming opportunities.These surveys are for watershed management purposes only.  Your responses will not be used for commercial purposes nor will your responses be released to others for commercial purposes.  Your responses will be kept confidential and only aggregated results will be released to government agencies.  Your cooperation responding to this survey will contribute toward sustaining the valuable ecosystem services of the Grand River watershed.For further information on this survey, contact us by email at: [emailÂ protected].

Why not just ensure that the river doesn't get polluted, and that development is kept to a minimum to reduce run-off diversion, and the issues should take care of themselves. You maintain a healthy river that is good for all three groups they're concerned about."
861954,DSS,2014-07-07 17:11:00,3,"Hi Dave, thanks for the question and let me start off by saying you are completely correct. The goal of these surveys is to estimate the types, level and distribution of angling, boating, and swimming activities and their economic value within the Grand River watershed. In order to make informed policy recommendations one must have some indication of the economic services that the watershed provides and their use. These surveys are just one of the ways we are accomplishing this and when combined with other ongoing work, including those that you have mentioned, we will continue to work towards protecting water quality in the Grand River watershed.  Cheers!"
861965,Oggie,2014-07-07 18:30:00,588,"I wish other fisheries were as accessible and mapped out as the Grand.  I get tired of the No Parking signs popping up all over Simcoe, Scugog, Puslinch etc.  We've done a good job of balancing river use and the interests of landowners along the Grand IMO. Keep up the good work DSS. Dan O."

862128,DSS,2014-07-08 13:47:00,3," Yes, completely hypothetical.    DSS is contracted by Environment Canada as part of the Great Lakes Nutrient Initiative  Thanks for the questions! "
