Costco at Dixie Dundas had it marked for 199.99 today, got mine adjusted, they still had a few left. Solid deal if you can manage to grab one. Figured id post as they may be some looking into these high end coolers. No reviews as i haven't had a chance to test mine yet, its been sitting.  http://www.pelicanprogear.ca/elite_coolers.php  Ill be trying it out at the end of July, hopefully the ice will last 10-12 days. My old Coleman Extremes did pretty well. Held ice for 7-10 days."
