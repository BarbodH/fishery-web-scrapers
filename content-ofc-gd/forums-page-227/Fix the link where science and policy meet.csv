862143,Musky or Specks,2014-07-08 15:32:00,2710,The problem with that concept of coarse is that science is not done for fun. Science is now all about the research money. Which is why for every study that says one thing you can find a study that says the opposite. And once again it doesn't matter who is in charge politically we live in an Oligarchy not a Democracy and the rich and entitled will always dictate policy until we all stand up and demand change.(Crap now I'm back on a list again)
