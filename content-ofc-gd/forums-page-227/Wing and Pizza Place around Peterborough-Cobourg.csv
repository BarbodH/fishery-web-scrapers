862313,mikeh,2014-07-09 12:17:00,824,"there is a pizza place in Bewdley, park or dock your boat out front"
862315,Garnet,2014-07-09 12:30:00,2056,Bewdley Pizza is the best. Don't bother asking for exacter cheez.  Jim's Pizza in Port Hope main st and other locations in peterbourgh  is very good. Port Hope has a small dine in area.  And I've heard about a poutine joint across from MNR building Peterbough that is good. The turkey poutine was recommended.  The Railside is also a good dine in restaurant in Port Hope.
