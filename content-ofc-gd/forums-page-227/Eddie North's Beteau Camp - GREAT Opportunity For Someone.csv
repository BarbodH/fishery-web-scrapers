I don't have to tell anyone about the quality of the fishery at Beteau, it's well known.  Anyhow the week of July 26 to August 2 is available. There will be no one else in camp that week, you'll be their entirely by yourselves. That said whoever does jump on this must be able to fend for themselves.  Because it's last minute (there was a cancellation) the price is pretty killer.  If anyone's interested and has either a group of two or four give me a call or shoot me an email. Contact info is on my website (it's in my signature)  Cheers"
