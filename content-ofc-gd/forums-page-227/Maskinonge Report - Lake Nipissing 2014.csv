860955,doubleheader,2014-06-30 19:06:00,497,Fabulous pictures. When you can catch an eagle taking a pike for a ride or a crane catching a sunny that's persistance. The impossible would be Lew smiling

I will fish all day, but when I see something I want to take a picture of, the rod goes down and the camera goes up.  I've made it work out not too badly and enjoy it alot, but sometimes when I'm taking the pics I think, not going to catch a musky with my lure out of the water"
861718,blaque,2014-07-05 14:31:00,2419,"Lol,  exactly"
860789,Joey,2014-06-29 17:49:00,9122,"What a wonderful week at lake Nipissing.  We had booked at Lakair for the week, but as Lew mentioned, due to illness, Lakair is not opening this year.  After a search online, we found Maskinonge Lodge, formerly Lucky Strike Camp.   The owners, Regan and Goldie, are two of the nicest people we have ever met and took care of all of our amenities as soon as we arrived.  From launching the boat to getting ice and firewood, we felt right at home in the cabin overlooking the lake.  As much as I like Lakair, I have to admit, it was much more quiet at this lodge. Less boat traffic and you don't hear the trucks on the highway.   We arrived at about noon on Saturday with a nice drive up, no highway jerks to speak of.  We unpacked and settled in and after introducing ourselves to Regan, Goldie, their son Russel and dog Barney, we waited for Lew and Diane to arrive.  They got unpacked and we all decided to just take it easy and fish on Sunday.  We took a boat ride down to Lakair Sunday afternoon and went in search of Les or Kevin.  It was a sad sight to see the grass unmown and nobody around at a place we've all been used to being filled with laughter and mayhem.  We found them at the house, sat out in the yard and caught up on life.  The water was very high, as you can see in the pictures of the dock  IMG_1353 by Joeyfishing, on Flickr   IMG_1356 by Joeyfishing, on Flickr   Here is my most favorite picture of the whole trip  IMG_1357 by Joeyfishing, on Flickr   After that we headed over to Memquisit as somebody forgot their fishing licence and outdoors card at home (me   ) and for $20 they printed off both for  me.  After that it was off to Muskrat Bay, only to find barely any weeds.  I don't ever think I've seen less weeds in the lake. We fished for a few hours under the big fireball in the sky and then headed back for BBQ'd steak  We did fish just out of the lodge a few times and caught some pike, but there were no weeds to be seen there either.   Lew circled around and told me there was a bald eagle in the trees up ahead, so I got the camera ready and fired away in delight  IMG_4999 by Joeyfishing, on Flickr   IMG_5010 by Joeyfishing, on Flickr   IMG_5170 by Joeyfishing, on Flickr   He even gave us a show fishing for pike (which is better than we did all week   )  IMG_5371 by Joeyfishing, on Flickr   IMG_5409 by Joeyfishing, on Flickr   Lew and Di fishing next to us   IMG_5026 by Joeyfishing, on Flickr     This was our view every night from the deck  IMG_1359 by Joeyfishing, on Flickr    I don't even remember Monday, but Tuesday it rained most of the day.  We decided to fish ""pike alley"" and got skunked. We were all soaking wet and Ralphie was not impressed.  IMG_1399 by Joeyfishing, on Flickr   IMG_1407 by Joeyfishing, on Flickr   IMG_1411 by Joeyfishing, on Flickr   John and Barbara came for a visit and stayed with Lew and Di.  They will be coming up to join us in August and wanted to case the place out.   Didn't get any pictures for some reason but it was nice to see you two again.   The rest of the time was mostly spent either fishing or socializing or smacking bugs off your body.  The deer and horse flies were a  bit relentless.  Ralphie got bit under the eye on one of our walks and i had to give him a Benedryl just in case.   IMG_1422 by Joeyfishing, on Flickr   IMG_1423 by Joeyfishing, on Flickr    The rest are just random shots of the trip.  IMG_1368 by Joeyfishing, on Flickr   IMG_4822 by Joeyfishing, on Flickr   Lew and Regan  IMG_6252 by Joeyfishing, on Flickr  IMG_6177 by Joeyfishing, on Flickr  IMG_6156 by Joeyfishing, on Flickr   IMG_5796 by Joeyfishing, on Flickr   IMG_6461 by Joeyfishing, on Flickr   IMG_6463 by Joeyfishing, on Flickr   IMG_6498 by Joeyfishing, on Flickr  IMG_6502 by Joeyfishing, on Flickr   IMG_6506 by Joeyfishing, on Flickr   IMG_6534 by Joeyfishing, on Flickr      IMG_5838 by Joeyfishing, on Flickr    IMG_6444 by Joeyfishing, on Flickr  IMG_6432 by Joeyfishing, on Flickr      okay, and what the heck is this????????????????????  IMG_5644 by Joeyfishing, on Flickr     Oh ya, and the flat on the way home, good times   IMG_1437 by Joeyfishing, on Flickr      "
860794,Rich Clemens,2014-06-29 18:14:00,3131,Great pics Joey.  You always seem to be at the right place at the right time.    Maybe there will be a. Inch of weeds when we all meet up in August.    That's two great reports from this camp - sounds like the new owners are doing it right.   We want to stop in and see Kevin and Leslie as well.    See at all soon.
860797,lew,2014-06-29 18:49:00,12766,"I guess the best way to sum up our trip was we had a blast Joey, it's always fun spending time with you & Paul and as always it was great seeing John & Barb again too. Catching muskies is what it's all about, for me anyways, but if their not around we still always seem to have a fantastic trip anyhow and as long as Dianes catching the odd pike, she's having a ball.  As expected your pictures turned out excellent & if you don't mind, I'll borrow a few, specially the one of Diane, it turned out great.  Hope Ralphies feeling better, the bugs really seemed to zero in on the poor little guy.  Lousy luck  having that flat too.  Here's a couple pics I got of you guys just below the eagle.      "
860798,Gregoire,2014-06-29 18:56:00,1397,"Great pics, although for some reason there is a lack of slime. Thanks for sharing."
860801,John,2014-06-29 19:05:00,2956,"Great seeing you guys again even just for a day or two. Regan and Goldie are great people and look forward to getting to know them better in August. Quiet area of the West Arm with little boat traffic, very peaceful! Great pics as usual Joey. Lew, I guess that you and Regan didn't see a fish on Thursday? Joey hope Ralphie is feeling better."
860803,lew,2014-06-29 19:21:00,12766,"Lew, I guess that you and Regan didn't see a fish on Thursday?   Nope, not even a sniff John and we spent 6 hours looking, the extreme lack of weeds is just crazy this year and something I've never seen up there before.  We're gonna hook up for another day though when I'm at Memquisit in August and hopefully things have improved by then."
860804,Terry,2014-06-29 19:24:00,14456,looks like a good time
860819,spincast,2014-06-29 20:58:00,3279,great shots (as always) Joey - this one is spectacular   always good to get away with friends and just enjoy the simple pleasures
860822,Joeytier,2014-06-29 21:44:00,3990,"Amazing shots, especially of the heron feeding...just amazing.  I sort of skimmed over some of it, but no walleyes for the whole trip?"

860826,woodenboater,2014-06-29 21:55:00,2277,"Great report and photos Joey ! man, the docks at Lakair must been nuts during the 2/4 ! or totally submerged"

860896,Beans,2014-06-30 13:47:00,3339,Thanks for all the great pics Joey...makes me feel like I was right there with y'all...
860918,bigbuck,2014-06-30 16:17:00,2449,"The only musky caught was by the eagle!! Love the shot of Lew fishing with Dianne. Typical scowl!!! Too bad about Lakair, I was planning on heading up yhere one of these days. Hopefully the health issues get resolved, time, faith, perserverance and some just plain old stubborness are needed. Glad you guys had fun."
860924,Rodbender,2014-06-30 17:06:00,1027,Great pics and great story Joey  Now get rid of that neck strap for the camera my neck is hurting just looking at it check out the staps like black rapid and the like I love mine set it up so the camera is easy to carry with the tripod foot on the lens little bit of pressure on your fingers and a bit on your shoulder I can carry mine allday no problems
860927,lew,2014-06-30 17:09:00,12766,"Typical scowl!!!  C'mon Bruce, that was one of my better smiles"
