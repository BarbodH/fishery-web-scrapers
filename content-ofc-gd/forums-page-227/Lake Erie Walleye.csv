862101,Old Ironmaker,2014-07-08 07:53:00,8243,"Looking good there Corvette1. The pic fishing is really picking up here at Nanticoke as well. We haven't had the numbers you had there but good nevertheless. Starting to get the odd Coho as well. Haven't even seen one for years. It's hot at Pt. Bruce as well. Funny how they hardly even use spinners on the west side of the point, mostly all those crazy named Silver Streak spoons and plugs. We have our Dipseys and leadcore set at basically the same depth as well. Only one fish on the downriggers in 4 trips. Have you noticed bait balls and fish right on bottom? A pal at Bruce is seeing that as well. I thought maybe it was structure but it's not.  I've never seen so much high winds and wind shifts as this July. Lucky I can pick any day but it is tough for the working folks. Bud took a week of to go out longlining with us last week and only got out 1 day for perch with a NE, ENE wind. I only end up washing bait with those winds and swore last year to stop wasting gas. A few were out in those winds, netted a few but nothing to write about.  Good work."
862106,solopaddler,2014-07-08 09:41:00,8605,Sweet! Why bother driving all the way to Nakina on Friday? Speaking of which if I don't talk to you before then good luck and safe travels bud.
