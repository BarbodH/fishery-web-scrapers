862001,misfish,2014-07-07 21:50:00,29133,"Thanks again.  I have been pre tying the hook section. Have them hanging on my PC desk.All I need to do then is add beads and blades. Long ones,short ones,single and double blades. Im going to try triple willow leaf.  IMO, it will look like a school of minnows.  Hey,if you dont try,you will never know.    Is this how the musky guys start out? Catch a musky on a worm harness,and say hey,I can make them bigger and badder.    No offence fellas."

I like 14lb myself in the clear colour.  As far as clevises go I use the plastic quick change ones exclusively as it allows me to swap out blades easily and there's no wear on the line.  Knots are easy. Plenty of vid's on youtube how to do it, this one's not bad.    "
862140,adempsey,2014-07-08 15:14:00,1498,"I use Trilene Big Game 20/24lb.   It's cheap and effective.   You want a stiff line to keep things straight and moving.   I personally don't  think fluorocarbon makes any difference with respect to ""clarity"", but you can probably use a lower pound test line, relative to mono, to get the stiffness you need.  I use a folded clevice because they are cheap and work just fine.   If I want a different color I just change my harness.   Besides, it gives me the option to make a ton of them!!   Of course, I have so many now I haven't made any new ones in a long time.  I think I've made a harness version of every single color of the Reef Runner minnow baits, including the special editions.  Was a fun project.  "

I rig up a bunch ready to fish at home, in my favourite colour/blade/bead combinations, but I also keep a few bare hooks snelled so I can rig to conditions  only reason I like flat foam better to store the rigs, is because it sits nicer in my tackle bag...pool foam is a bit bulky"

In this link the end of the line comes out the bottom and in the image it is cut, in Brian's case it would go to the second hook.  It appears to come off the top of your hook B and may give it some weird action.

861484,kickingfrog,2014-07-03 21:28:00,8333,"    Plenty tied up. Most with quick change clevises. Spare blades, beads and weights inside the yellow tubes. I'll tie new ones on the water if I have to but I hate tying on the water. Too many fish to catch, a boat to control, too wavy and too cold to manipulate fingers for good knots. Compared to the space that all my lures take up a couple dozen harnesses and spare parts is negligible."

861486,Roy,2014-07-03 21:42:00,13728,"Nice Brian but there's another little thing you should look at.....if you're using two different size blades, always put the small blade at the front. The way yours are set up, the larger blade at the front will stop the rear smaller blade from turning. That's why spinnerbaits always have the small blade at the front. BTW, I make mine 3' to 4' long with a small swivel at the front."

861489,Spanky80,2014-07-03 22:25:00,152," Well,I made two.    What ya think?      I found some trout beads in my tickle trunk. The seem to work ok.   Look good Misfish!     Here is another link that might help with the 2nd hook orientation:  http://www.thebeacon.net/local-news/item/3229  I might suggest adding some smaller beads around the blades on the first harness, those large beads might interfere with your blades.  Last year when I used pre-made harnesses, I lost a few nice fish close to the boat, but now that I can choose a higher quality (and slightly larger) hook(s), seems to have made a difference...not that I've set the walleye world on fire yet this season."
861493,Sinker,2014-07-03 22:30:00,8692,"I like single blades, and never make them longer than 2ft. No need for where I fish.  I honestly find the simpler the better. My all time fav is silver hammered colorado blade with red beads. Catches everything that swims.  S."

Well I reversed the blades Roy,and now have a 6 inch harness.  I sure hope size dosent matter here.   Shane,they are both 12 inches long.. Wll they were before the correction.   Those I have lots of. One for the cell,one for the smokes and lighter,and so on..  Now back to tying."
861542,wormdunker,2014-07-04 08:48:00,1711,"Good job, I like 'em!  I tie mine 48"" long, I like to keep the baited hooks away from the swivel which is connected to the bottom bouncer = less hardware to spook the fish."
861575,Sinker,2014-07-04 13:26:00,8692,"Yes, off a bottom bouncer, 4ft is standard. I only use a bouncer in 20ft or deeper, and its not very often I have to fish that deep. Generally in water less than 15ft, a 1/4 oz bullet weight 2ft from the spinner will get you down where the fish are, with about 100ft of line out, trolling 1.3-1.5 mph.  I like them 2ft because most times the weight will catch the weeds, and the spinner will still be clear. Its a lot easier to manage a 2ft lead than a 4 ft lead in that situation IMO. I also find a lot of times when I hook a weed, I give it a good rip, and right when the spinner frees from the weeds is when the fish will hit.....there is a short pause as it comes off the weeds, and whammo!  S."
861594,DRIFTER_016,2014-07-04 16:18:00,10439,Don't forget to tie a few with Spin and Glows or floating beads for those times you want a little buoyancy to get your offering up off the bottom.
861625,brw,2014-07-04 18:42:00,101,"Agree I use 15 or 20 lb florouclear P-Line. Only real difference is the 20 lb is a little harder to snell b/c the diameter of the line is too thick for some hooks' eyelets as you try to double back to snell the hook. Both sizes acquitted themselves well recently after a week of pounding by both the rocks and walleyes of Georgian Bay. I was pleasantly surprised with their durability. Also, I have found that the easiest way to store is to slice a section of pool noodle about 3/4 to 1 in and thread the harness one per slice. The blade sits well inside the hole and you can stuff a bunch individually into a plastic tackle tray. This worked better for me than slicing a larger section and threading 5-6 per section."

861981,kickingfrog,2014-07-07 19:46:00,8333,"I rarely make mine with two blades, but lots do and never have issues. Just use enough beads to keep the blades far enough apart."

861355,Ralph Field,2014-07-02 23:03:00,1018,"I would use 15lb. floro,for the abrasion resistance as I find the clevises hard on the line. I would use a snell knot for the top hook and whatever you like for the bottom hook, which is tied to the tag end of the top hook."
861356,bare foot wader,2014-07-02 23:05:00,1354,"for open water I tie them on heaver line, usually 20 lb  durability is important so it's not frayed up after a few fish, but when I know I'll snag up more often I tie them on 12 lb, so when I snag I'll keep my bouncer, and tie them up with cheaper components, my open water rigs tend to have fancier blades/more expensive components  a piece of square foam at a craft store is cheap and makes you a few rig holders...pipe insulation too  learn a snell knot too"

861361,Burtess,2014-07-02 23:21:00,901,I have used 20lb XL to tie mine.  Also to reduce the clevis wear on the line make sure you use the folded clevis and not the ones with the holes punched through.  Burt
861364,mattp33,2014-07-02 23:38:00,290,Sounds like you are on the right tracck here.  I use 15-20lbs seagar flouro

861378,Joeytier,2014-07-03 00:58:00,3990,"All depends on the harness and what you want it for.  I just tied a couple small ones for speckles and used 4 lb mono.  For walleye and pike I usually prefer wire, but if you're insistent on line I would use XT in either 12 or 14 lb test"
861391,Fang,2014-07-03 01:42:00,1330,Go heavier flouro 15 lb or higher if your using the metal clevises and have some toothey critters around. I prefer to use the plastic quick change clevices as I feel they're easier on the line and I don't have to be limited to only color and size of blade I tie up. I have 15-20 snells tied up ranging on a couple different lb test and beads colors. Mix in some floating bodies too.  In walleye lakes up north I primarily use 12 lb flouro and ha a couple 15's as back up
861393,kickingfrog,2014-07-03 01:45:00,8333,"Snell knot is easy to learn. I usually tie a small snap swivel on the end to attach to what ever I'm using, 3-way or bottom bouncer.  I tie a few different set-ups. Smaller blades 10lb flouro now (but mono served me well for a long time). Bigger blades 15-20 lb flouro."

861414,fishindevil,2014-07-03 07:34:00,6254,Folded clevises all the way they will reduce line wear for sure and will not bend as easy and I mostly use trilene big game 14lb test !!!!!

Spacing of the blades is important too !!!!!!
