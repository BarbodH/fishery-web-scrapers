I know it was on fire in the spring.  Just hoping the action is still solid.  Will be heading there July 26 for 2 weeks!  woot  Thanks in advance"
862210,ONbuckhunter,2014-07-08 20:40:00,39,I launched at around noon today to do some prefishing for an upcoming tourney.  I got out and was stuck in a wicked wind and rain storm.  I was solo too so the instant I had a break in weather I wheeled outta there.  I casted maybe 25 times and landed two buckets and that's it. I'll be out at least 3 more times this week and one more time next weekend.  I spoke to a Cpl guys at launch and they only caught 4 walleye.
862286,AdamS,2014-07-09 02:21:00,161,I'd love to spend 2 weeks there...I was up there for the long weekend and fishing was ok. Didn't get to fish too much but me and a buddy caught a couple descent largies.  The people at the cottage next to us did well though. They brought back a couple nice 4+lber's. I asked around about the walleye but no one was really catchin them that weekend. It was ridiculously hot there though.
