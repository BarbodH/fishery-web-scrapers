I have narrowed my search to used boats under 4k, Aluminum with a deep hull, 16ft minimum,  40hp minimum.   I keep seeing the 16ft Mr Pike model by lund in this range and am hoping for the communities input on their experience with this boat.  I will not be fishing the great lakes but want something that can handle lakes up to the size of Nipissing and St Clair.  I would also fish the interior of Georgian Bay from Honey Harbor north from time to time, the 1000 islands and the Kawarthas.  Thanks"
861827,Steve,2014-07-06 18:12:00,2075,"if i recall correctly, mr pike were the widest lund boats for their respective length.  the mr pike is now a discontinued line of boats, but were top notch - and if taken care of, likely still is."
861828,grt1,2014-07-06 18:14:00,638,"16foot is a great length for general purpose fishing, if you are using a 40 hp motor it should move along quite well. if it's a lund, it should be serviceable for years to come. the aluminum boats just go on and on. I have a 14 foot skiff and it was made in the 50s and still floats (with a few rivets sealed) . you won't be disappointed with a lund."
861829,bushart,2014-07-06 18:21:00,2628,If I recall...Lund made a 16 footer with a floor in it----was much like their Alaskan---a step up from a reg 16 foot alum lund  Then I believe The Mr. Pike went somewhere closer to a Pro V style  So there's several animals out there that could be branded Mr Pike

861877,tizfun,2014-07-07 02:35:00,292,"My fishing partner has a 2001 Lund Pike 16 powered with a 115 hp Optimax... Runs strong, alot of room to fish out of because of it's width. Only thing is the console seems too far ahead for my liking and it doesn't leave room for the front deck.. Don't get me wrong here, there's room but I'm just comparing it to my boat as we fish out of both.  As for the price being under 4k. Guess it depends on how old you get, but I haven't seen any 1998 or newer in that price range..  You won't be disappointed if you find one.. they are very nice boats to fish out of..

861887,BillsTheBassMan,2014-07-07 03:27:00,932,Thanks for all the posts guys.  I like the sounds of the model.  The wide beam is reassuring.  Thanks for the link Tiz.
861889,tizfun,2014-07-07 03:40:00,292,"No problem... Here's a boat (Princecraft) that for the money, is a great deal... I had one years back and loved it..  If you're willing to make the drive, you'll never find one this cheap here...  http://www.lake-link.com/tradingpost/ad.cfm/71196/95-Pro-169-Princecraft/"
861898,bushart,2014-07-07 11:45:00,2628,Again...the Mr. Pike had several versions---I'm pretty sure the older models were very much like a 16 foot tinny Lund  the newer ones...get a different hull----and are like a Pro v deep v hull design-----if you find that model for under 4 with a motor---let me know cuz I'll buy 2
861920,BFSC Kevin,2014-07-07 14:16:00,1351,Yes.  I agree with bushart. I'm sure there were two versions that came out by lund. One like a pro v and one like a tinny.
