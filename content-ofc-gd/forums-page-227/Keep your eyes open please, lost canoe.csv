Lost canoe on the Burnt River If anyone on here happens to see a red fibreglass canoe floating around Cameron or in the Burnt River, please let me know. It was last seen on Thursday night a few bends down river from Burnt River rd, it can be anywhere by now. The water came up and took it away earlier in the week. Any help would be great, thanks."
