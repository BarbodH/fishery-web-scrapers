I have used Waltonian Inn before to launch but an email and two calls about a slip have gone unanswered. Hunter's Bay marina is the next closest option that I'm aware of but I figured I'd check here if anyone knew of a closer one to Greening's Bay, which is 2 bays west of where Waltonian is. Greening's Bay cottages does not allow use of their ramp and has no slips available."

You can also use the public ramp at the end of Birchgrove, but I have no idea what state it's in since I've only used it in the winter."
