861688,BillM,2014-07-05 01:04:00,17367,SWEET.  How do those rippin raps move through the water? Are they spastic? Was looking at them.  Very quick back and forth with the pivot point being the bottom of the lure.  Typical lipless crankbait action.
861692,Duckie,2014-07-05 01:21:00,305,"^ agreed.  what I really like about the rapala rippin raps vs all the other lipless crankbaits is that their finish holds up extremely well, they seem to cast even better for their weight and they seem to run a little more shallow than your typical lipless crank (as compared to say a rat l trap or rattlin' rapala) which allows you to fish shorelines and submerged weedbeds a little easier than with your typical lipless crank.  I am a big fan of these baits. esp. the white colour. its dynamite.  last fall I caught a huge salmon on the 1/2oz version, also in white.  I'm hooked LOL"
