862312,Terry,2014-07-09 12:15:00,14456,I found my line and lure wraped around my prop Lol Just kidding.  I don't know what it was
862321,BillM,2014-07-09 13:06:00,17367,Probably an Atlantic.
862331,fishnsled,2014-07-09 14:20:00,3520,Good fishing again gents! That mount looks pretty sweet Brian and at a fractions of the cost!
861823,misfish,2014-07-06 17:45:00,29133,"All I can say is,Terry put on a clinic Saturday  Simcoe smallies was our target.. I mention we should try an ice fishing spot where we knew there was a good transition. Sand shallow,then drop to weeds and rocks. He did well.Nice fish buddy.MAYBE, WE CAN TRADE HATS NEXT TIME. I caught two,but one was picture worthy.. Atleast I look good eh mang. The bite slowed right down so Terry says,lets do some rigg,n for lakers. The N/W winds were up there, but what the hell,lets go.The fishing gods must of been with him this day, or he had horse shoes up his   cuz man,his rod was loaded 3 times in an hour. First one fought like it was a 20 pounder. When it got to the boat,I say whatttttttt?    .Simcoe lakers are the best fighters bar none IMO.so we set up again and theres a bit of an issue with the trolling motor. As Terrys stretched out over the rigger board,his rod goes off again. I yell Terry fish,fish,fish,,,,,,,WHAT,I jab him in the ribs and say you got a fish on. (I never grab another mans rod) The line is peeling and peeling and there was no stopping this fish. Down to the end of the line and,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,he gone.  So grab another rod,rig it up and were off again.At this point I knew I was just out for a boat ride today,so sat back and caught some rays.So sitting there I see WHATTTTTT? Terrys rod is going off again. Hey Terry,ya,,you got a fish on,,,,AGAIN.It wasnt a bigg,n so I decided to take a short under water vid,then release it in the water.  I need longer arms."
861825,BillM,2014-07-06 18:02:00,17367,"I like that ice fishing spot as well, did pretty good there last year.   Good kill on the smallies!"
