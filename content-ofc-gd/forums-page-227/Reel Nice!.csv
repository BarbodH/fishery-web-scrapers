861727,Meely,2014-07-05 16:31:00,282,"    I came across these two reels and was wondering if anyone out in OFC-land can offer any info on them.  I haven't had time to research them on the net yet as I just got them and wont have access and time until tomorrow night.  Is anyone experienced in these reels? Year?  Worth? I see what looks like dates on them but am not sure.  The clickers , drag system etc all still work great. I'm not planning on selling them but would be interested to know if they are worth anything.  Shakespeare on left (also second picture): Markings: 1922  Wondereel Delux, Inglis Canada, Model GF  Pflueger on right (also 3rd picture): Markings: Nobby Mark, No. 1963 , Made in USA  Thanks for any info."
