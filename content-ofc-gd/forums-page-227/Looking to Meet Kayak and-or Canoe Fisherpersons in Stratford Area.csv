I'm new to the area. I enjoy all types of fishing, everything from lolling about with an ultralight and bobber for crappie, bluegill perch to pounding a steelhead stream all day in my waders. I'm teaching myself how to fly fish (could use some help). PM if you would like to meet or if you know of a good club in the region.  "
