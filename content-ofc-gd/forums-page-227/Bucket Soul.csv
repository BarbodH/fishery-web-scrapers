861522,MJL,2014-07-04 00:59:00,2427,"When it comes to bass fishing, I'm really an outsider looking in. I never did a lot of bass fishing growing up and I still don't - Being without a boat also doesn't help. I often feel lost wandering the isles of tackle shops when searching for lures to stock my tackle box with. I feel most at home on a fast flowing, emerald green steelhead river with a long rod in hand.  A couple years ago my friends taught me a little about frogs, senkos and jigs. I've slowly learned more about the habits of the 'green' bass and I quite like what I'm seeing  Largemouth bass by MJLeung, on Flickr  Zoom by MJLeung, on Flickr  Half & half bass by MJLeung, on Flickr  Largemouth bass by MJLeung, on Flickr  Bucketmouth by MJLeung, on Flickr  On the Senko by MJLeung, on Flickr  Silhouette by MJLeung, on Flickr  Backlit Bass by MJLeung, on Flickr  Largemouth by MJLeung, on Flickr  Going in for the kill by MJLeung, on Flickr  Morning frog action by MJLeung, on Flickr  Largemouth by MJLeung, on Flickr  Lipped by MJLeung, on Flickr  largemouth by MJLeung, on Flickr  It's not often that I'm the one in front of the camera...But today was an exception Grip & Grin by MJLeung, on Flickr  Although largemouth don't run like salmon or cartwheel and tail walk like autumn steelhead do, I'm having a blast with them. Watching them explode on a frog is pretty awesome.  I'm itching to catch some more...And I definitely have more pictures in mind that I'd love to take  Hope you enjoyed  Mike"
