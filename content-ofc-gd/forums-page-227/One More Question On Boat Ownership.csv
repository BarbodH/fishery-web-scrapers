862361,bushart,2014-07-09 19:08:00,2628,Thanks Gallie

862384,pikeyminnow,2014-07-09 20:38:00,18,Just make sure you keep a copy of the sales tax receipt for your boat. I bought mine about four yrs ago and just got a notice from the Ministry of Finance asking to pay the tax on the purchase price or provide proof that it had been already paid. Luckily I kept a copy. What a joke...doing someone else's job for them.
862386,bushart,2014-07-09 20:40:00,2628,Looks like he has 90 days to change ownership---maybe I'll fotocopy my document and just write sold across it or something

862443,pikeyminnow,2014-07-10 00:14:00,18,No....sorry. The buyer will have to pay tax and should keep the receipt. I paid the tax on mine when I transferred the trailer ownership. Had separate bill of sales for traer and boat.
862448,John Bacon,2014-07-10 00:35:00,3277,Don't let him tow the boat away with your plate on the trailer.  I think it is possible to transfer the ownership of the plate; but when I sold my trailer I just told the buyer that I was keeping the plate and he could apply for his own.  I was not about to take the risk of 407 bills or be held accountable for something he did with my plate on the trailer.
862450,bushart,2014-07-10 00:39:00,2628,Yeah--The plate stays with me
