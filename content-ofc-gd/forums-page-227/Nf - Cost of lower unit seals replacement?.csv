It caught me off guard in the fall and really hoped it was worn screw grommets...  Well after a new season start and a few trips around Balsam a quick check showed the same results.  Seen tons of video how to diy and just wondering on the pros and cons and what a mech would charge. I,m home next week with it in Hamilton and probably will start calling around."

861773,scugpg,2014-07-06 01:33:00,1373,I've had good dealings with Clarence at bay city marine in Hamilton.  If you're calling around they would be a good starting point. I'd rather have a mech do that job as they have the tools to pressure test etc after the job is done.
