861976,josappy,2014-07-07 19:23:00,11,"Hello all,  My name is Joe kerwin, I just got posted to CFB Borden, Originally from P.E.I  I am very new to fresh water fishing and am looking for locations around my are that are good for shore fishing. I heard Lake Simcoe but it seems to only be good if you own a boat. Also any tip you can give me on different lures to use or tricks that work for bass , pike , walleye it would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks for any information"
861982,misfish,2014-07-07 19:50:00,29133,"Welcome to the board .  There is some good fishing from shore here. Spring and fall are the best times.  If your into trout and salmon river fishing. You have  the two best rivers running through the base.  Fisherman on the board would be a good guy to get a hold of. He works on the base.    I always like to trade info for lobster,if you can get some fresh ones flown up.  Enjoy your stay,and dont take things personal here. Good bunch of members here."
862009,josappy,2014-07-07 22:07:00,11,"thanks for the info, i been going down too kingston a lot looking for musky but no luck as of yet"
862028,Musky or Specks,2014-07-07 23:26:00,2710,Welcome to the board. A lot of trout fishing over your way. If you ever wnat to meet up for some river smallmouth fishing over towards the Saugeen Wed-Fri I'm more than happy to give you a few spots
862032,josappy,2014-07-07 23:45:00,11,"awesome, sent you a message"
862246,captpierre,2014-07-08 23:03:00,2521,Welcome to the Board.  Get to know somebody with a boat that knows Simcoe.  All kinds of action there.  year round.
862270,Gerritt,2014-07-09 00:44:00,6129,If you get down towards the Trenton base I would be happy to show you around here some good shore fishing oppourtunities
862278,NAW,2014-07-09 01:39:00,4022,"Welcome aboard Joe!  I'm not much of a shore fisherman.  But there are plenty of good rivers around.  Just look for spots where all the cars are parked on the sides of the roads!  There's quite often guys on the board looking for people to join them for outings in their boats..  As well as get togethers.  They are always a good time, and you'll learn lots!  Keep An eye out.  If ya ever want to get out on the water, you can borrow my canoe for a day!  I've never met an east coaster I didn't like, so I'm assuming with out actually meeting you that your a decent guy..."
862280,josappy,2014-07-09 01:45:00,11,thanks all for the warm welcome.   there is no such thing as a bad east coaster :)  as long as you can handle the drinking
862292,NAW,2014-07-09 02:49:00,4022,No only can I handle it.......  I can keep up!!!!
862314,josappy,2014-07-09 12:21:00,11,No only can I handle it....... I can keep up!!!!  We should go fishing together then lol
862332,4x4bassin,2014-07-09 14:21:00,1025,"Welcome , great bunch here . I live in Mansfield just on the south/west side of the base , lots of good river fishing in this area . Spring and fall are the best times for trout and salmon . Like others have said Simcoe is a great fishery as well ! I would assume that you are an active member of the military and if so I believe you would have access to Mountain Lake at CFB Meaford (LFCATC Meaford)  I would look into that if I was you . I have had the pleasure of fishing there several times and it is worth it . Mind you I have not been there in a couple years , at the time it was a great smallmouth bass and walleye lake . At that time only military and members of east grey hunters and anglers were allowed access , and for all you ""Lurkers"" out there I wouldn't be trying to sneak in for a quick fish . It is a military base    Good luck !"
862362,josappy,2014-07-09 19:12:00,11,"i seen on base here we have a rod and gun club, not sure what membership prices are or anything, but ill have too look into it"
862364,mattp33,2014-07-09 19:26:00,290,you guys also have a 1000yrd range out there.  I shot 50 cals out to 1000 a few weeks ago
862367,Big Cliff,2014-07-09 19:44:00,6899,"Well welcome to the board although why anyone would want to leave PEI to come North totally eludes me. Oysters, clams, all kinds of fishing, lobster in season and some of the nicest people I have ever had an opportunity to meet. We went for a quick visit and if our boat house hadn't been destroyed by a storm we'd probably have spent our entire summer there.  At any rate, we are over in the Kawarthas, you are welcome to come fish off our dock anytime (walleye, bass, muskie, carp and a million pan fish). I won't make any promises but once things slow down a bit for me I'll even try to get you out in the boat.  Add my email to your list and let me know if and when you would like to come.

862368,josappy,2014-07-09 19:44:00,11,"yeah its not a bad little training ground here, petawawa was a nicer base IMO"
