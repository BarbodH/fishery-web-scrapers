Had a couple hours free Friday evening so after a quick atv ride to the local creek to empty my minnow trap. I hit a local shore spot.  I can almost always depend on a handful of small keepers from this spot so I was super surprised to lay into this 23"" fatty.  Normally I don't keep em this big but she made for an excellent breakfast  The minnow hole     And I spent the last two days at my girlfriends familys hunt camp 60 + km's into one of the local ZEC's.  saturday was spent cutting trails and laying gravel on the atv's but we snuck out early this morning to a lake trout lake known for big numbers of smaller fish.  It didnt disappoint and in short order we had a stringer full of these tasty little guys.  What they lack in size they make up for in flavour   we took them on gangtroll/williams rigs pulled behind bells and dipsys.        The wheels.  Had to use the winch to pull the rickety old tank of a boat out of the water   Many more plans for this area"

I didn't hear or see a single other soul all weekend and it's a madhouse during moose season And a lot less of the stupidity you see in Ontario...no inconsiderate people at launch ramps, no OPP waiting to fine you for not having your paperwork in the correct order, or for having a beer in your boat.  I love the ZEC's!  I do try to avoid them with the ATV during moose season..."
