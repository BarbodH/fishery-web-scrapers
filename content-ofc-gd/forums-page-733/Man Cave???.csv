427639,Muskieman,2010-01-30 17:37:00,2472,"...  Since I hab a colb and am not going fishing today..  I'm sitting in my {new to me saying for basement} ""Man Cave"" and looking around and wondering if anyone else has ""permission"" from their wife to claim such a space in the house to call their own.  I had a 2 bedroom apartment in the basement of my house.. a few years back we decided to not rent it out anymore..  I then had room to decorate it at will with all my stuff and build a little bar.  The only stipulation my wife has ..""No Brass Poles""  A few pics..           RFS "

427674,canuckjack,2010-01-30 19:20:00,121,"Nice cave, but that poker set is gonna need a bigger table to call home  No cave here yet, the kids have a lot of growing to do before I can claim the basement as my own"
427682,Muskieman,2010-01-30 20:02:00,2472,  The wall where the Muskie and Artie The Antelope hang is coming down before spring.... this will add another 15' to the cave... I already have plans for a poker table and a pool table and a more masculine paint scheme.
