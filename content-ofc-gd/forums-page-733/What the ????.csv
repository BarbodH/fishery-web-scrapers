428391,fishermccann,2010-02-01 19:30:00,655,"How come "" what do you shave with? "" gets so much traffic on a fishing website, don't we have grooming websites for that stuff?   WHAT THE ????"
428392,Roy,2010-02-01 19:32:00,13728,So let's see how much traffic this fishing thread gets.
428398,danbouck,2010-02-01 19:45:00,4380,Because it's useful information for the 90% of us who would like a better shave
428405,Headhunter,2010-02-01 19:56:00,5703,"I beleive that using a half and half Williams spoon to shave with, qualifies it as a fishing related post! Then there is always the user control option on your keyboard/mouse that allows you to not click on a thread. HH"
428408,DRIFTER_016,2010-02-01 20:06:00,10439,  Same with the Bowie knife fer cuttin' yer bait.
428410,Terry,2010-02-01 20:08:00,14456,I do think that having non fishing threads is not a bad thing as it keeps people reading when the fishing post are few and far between and it makes it more of a community  but it does somewhat upset me to see that type of thread get more responses then the fishing threads....it make me wonder
428419,fishermccann,2010-02-01 20:17:00,655,"O.K. now I know, thanks  .Just wondering why it got more hits than some of the fishing topics, thats all."
428421,fishermccann,2010-02-01 20:19:00,655,"Not to bad 100 hits with the topic, "" what the ??? "" good job folks!!!"
428423,asdve23rveavwa,2010-02-01 20:29:00,2690,"So, I wasn't the only one wondering about that one, eh? Oh, well....makes for some entertaining reading at times."
428424,JohnF,2010-02-01 20:29:00,3494, Just because we smell like fish doesn't mean we can't be well groomed.  JF
428425,Joey,2010-02-01 20:32:00,9122,Speak for yourself John!!!   
428433,Nemo,2010-02-01 20:49:00,727,More people have to shave than get out fishing. Hence the interest.  If I got out to fish as often as I shave I would post a lot more...LOL
428440,Governator,2010-02-01 21:11:00,879,Has there been consideration for an Off Topic sub-forum?  It would definitely keep the clutter down imo.
428444,ChrisK,2010-02-01 21:15:00,2772, Why fix something that isn't broke......
428453,JohnF,2010-02-01 21:31:00,3494, But what if everyone stopped reading the fishing threads?  JF
428534,danbouck,2010-02-02 00:41:00,4380,"  It's discussed bi-weekly, the guys who bring it up don't usually stick around"
428537,douG,2010-02-02 00:46:00,2693,"Roy, I know, I know.  Ask me, ask me!  Ok, the answer to your question is, 'Plenty'."
428707,LeXXington,2010-02-02 15:30:00,1928,"Cause fishing post, went out,  it was cold,  caught nothing, came home are not that exciting"
428709,JohnF,2010-02-02 15:40:00,3494, And shaving with a straight razor is so durned exciting.  JF
428713,BillM,2010-02-02 15:52:00,17367, It can be if you need to call 911 because of a slip  :)
428714,JohnF,2010-02-02 15:55:00,3494, I'm too old to still be looking for adventure. The idea of being one tremor away from oblivion is not for me. Mebbe in my youth. My Excel triple header is exciting enuf nowadays.  JF
