427912,MSBruno,2010-01-31 17:42:00,369,"Looking for some help here ....  I know it's recommended to flip the bail by hand, but the reel should engage the bail flip with the turn of the handle.  On the reel I have, the bail flip is engaged most of the time, EXCEPT when the bail is flipped open towards the handle.  I'm not sure if thats a week part and not enough sped or torque is generated with the bail open at the handle, but I would think that this is uncommon.  I have 2 older spinning reel (mitchell) and 1 has the same issue, but the other one allows the bail to flip wherever it is flip, even if opened towards the handle.  Advice?  Send back to Shimano?"
427929,tjsa,2010-01-31 18:25:00,1578,"Probably a weak bail spring, or maybe the lubricant in the bail spring area does not like colder temps. Could also be a binding issue between the rotating parts. I use some extreme pressure, low temperature grease in the bail spring area, and rarely have issues unless it's below -25C. There is probably some better products out there, but that's all I have needed to use."
