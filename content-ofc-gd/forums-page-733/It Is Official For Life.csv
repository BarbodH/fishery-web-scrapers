428298,anders,2010-02-01 13:54:00,1168,definite congrats....and to the rest of you as well
428299,bigugli,2010-02-01 13:54:00,6138,It took me a mass coronary. When I came around I was told I could quit now or I would be back on the slab next month. That was 9 years and 8 months back.  I do enjoy reading that others have found the means to quit without enduring severe consequences first.
428302,asdve23rveavwa,2010-02-01 13:57:00,2690,Way to go!  Seventeen months now for me.

428367,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-02-01 18:09:00,0,good job! i quit 2 years ago and it was the best decision i ever made.  i had only smoked for 15 years and it was exceptionally difficult to do.  i don't know how some of you lifers quit but it's awesome to see.
428379,DRIFTER_016,2010-02-01 18:41:00,10439,"Good for you, keep it up!!!! I have been smoke free for 4036 days now and have not smoked more than 100,000 butts!!!!! I don't know what that comes out to money wise but it is probably enough to buy a good new car!!!! I know up here the cost of smokes is insane!!! At $15 a pack it would save me $61,000 over that time!!!!"
428418,ehg,2010-02-01 20:16:00,2666,"Cigarette companies are kinda evil. Taking your money and knowingly, slowly killing you.  Stopped buying them in May 2008 and know i will never smoke a cigarette again. It is easier once you do other things like drinking water or eating decent snacks etc...  Keep it up Peter."
428434,lookinforwalleye,2010-02-01 20:50:00,4399,"Good for you Peter, I started on Champix this past Friday this will be my second go round on Champix I hope it sticks this time.  Just a word of advice don`t let your guard down I can`t count how many times I have quit for 2 or 3 months only to relapse. The last quit was with Champix and I was off cigs for about 4 months and one day driving home from work I had an uncontrollable urge for a cig and that was it I was done. Keep up the good work."
428439,Flappn,2010-02-01 21:09:00,245,I quite two years ago on Champix. Keep it up.
