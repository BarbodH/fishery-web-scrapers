428269,Jer,2010-02-01 12:42:00,1426,I was wondering what the ice conditions were like near Beaverton and around the north end of Georgina Island.  We are hoping for a trip next weekend to the perch grounds around there and were wondering if we would be able to drive my truck out there. Last year there was plenty of traffic in the area and with this recent cold snap how has the ice built up?

There was est 12 inches of clear ice, harder to say being in the hut.  didnt see any trucks or cars where we were, just sleds, ATV's and outfitters bombardiers.  The ice surface closer to shore had some bumpy broken up areas that refroze.  Pretty slow day, only caught maybe 35 between 2 fishing and kept 9.  Saw a whitefish est 15 ft down but couldnt get it to commit.  The shallower huts seemed to do better."

428338,myot,2010-02-01 15:51:00,131,Ice is a good 12'' in the perch grounds but there is 1 preasure crack about 1km of shore its small and packed down but could open back up at any time Dan
