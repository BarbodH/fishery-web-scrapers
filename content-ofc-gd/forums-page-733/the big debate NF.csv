428583,irishfield,2010-02-02 02:45:00,26272,type plasma into that search function.. the debate wasn't that long ago..
428587,BillM,2010-02-02 02:49:00,17367,"Depends on where the TV is going to be... Upstairs in the livingroom, lots of light go with a LCD.  Downstairs a bit darker, plasma for sure.  Plasmas will have glare issues in a room with lots of light, but they tend to have better black levels then LCD's...  You can't really make a bad choice with the TV's of today..."
428592,charlied,2010-02-02 03:04:00,584,"They say plasma is more durable.  Thats what I went with.  Go minimum 50 inch, they are so affordable now."
428599,pike slayer,2010-02-02 03:15:00,1177,"irishfield thanks i did use the search thinger and i actually found the old topic usually i cant find a thing using the search! seems like most ppl vote plasma now which im surprised at its going down in the rec room theres 2 windows which shine some light in during the day and thats it, i dont think it'll be a big affect on glare."

For a better cost/benefit  ratio, a Panasonic Plasma in a darker environment would be a great choice especially for viewing sports due to its higher refresh rate. Also the tuf screen on a Panasonic is great to have if you have children around. If a child throws a bowl or tennis ball at an LCD, theres a good chance that screen will crack.   A 40"" is cutting it a bit close to use 1080p so you might want to check a 720 at your viewing distance and see if you can tell it apart from a 1080p tv.  Grab yourself a cheap hdmi cable  (NOT MONSTER CABLE) and a blu ray player and you're good to go. Just remember that rogers is not using 1080p...yet and it cost extra every month for the HD channels. So in some instances you're better off with a 720p tv set especially if you're not going to pay for HD channels or use a blu ray player.  Personally I'd go with a 46"" for my viewing at 15 feet. Might want to set aside $300-500+ for a receiver and  some surround speakers if you are a movie buff. 5.1 sound is so nice to have."
