We caught 15 fish although yours truly had a tough day with a single 2lb fish all day.  It was worth it though! Please enjoy my video report!  http://vimeo.com/9134232"

428431,troutologist,2010-02-01 20:44:00,951,"Right on dude, great song for the background too, I havent broke that disc out in a while.   Got a view of your tracks from the plane today, clear skies over that area and I got the binos out to check things out.  Keep it up."
428435,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-02-01 20:50:00,0," Neat that you could see our tracks!  It was a really good hike and between the treadmill, the weekly hikes, and the wife imposed yoga I'm finally starting to get back in shape.  I've got the gear trimmed down to the point that I'm no longer sore the next day... no sore knees and no hip flexor. Take care up north."

428525,MCTFisher9120,2010-02-02 00:18:00,3761,"Neat little report man. The highlight of my Ice fishing career would be nice trout like that.  Some Day I hope.  Thanks for sharing, MTBF"
428608,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-02-02 03:23:00,0," on the particular line in the photos i believe he had only a minnow head on the snelled hook, although we also use worms and nymph patterns as well.  the one gent was using a worm, then another 6 inches of line down to a nymph rubbing right on bottom."
428610,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-02-02 03:25:00,0," I have to be organized like that because my brain doesn't work at 4 am.  I lay out my clothes in the order I have to put them on so I don't end up with underwear on my head in place of a toque.  Also, my wife likes it when I am ready to go the night before.  Apparently I sound like a bull moose in a china shop when I'm getting my stuff ready in the morning.  The fish were VERY dark in this lake, quite a contrast from the incredibly red fish we caught last weekend."
428631,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-02-02 04:01:00,0,"i forgot to mention, almost all of the fish were hooked in the tip of the snout and were released quickly.  3 of the fish caught were a little worse off and were kept for a delicious speck dinner.  i myself will be having tilapia instead."
428637,Sinker,2010-02-02 04:59:00,8692,Nice dark fish!! Your lucky to live up there man!!  S.
