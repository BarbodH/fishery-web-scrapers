How is the fishing on the lake? I haven't found out much other than that it has bass and trout.  Any info is appreciated,"

I concentrate on lake trout, you need the right gear to target them although the odd one is caught relatively shallow in the sunmmer.  A large number of brook trout were stocked awhile back, however I've only caught 2 and that was several years ago.  Its a beautiful lake (I'm biased) with lots of side trip opportunities into other lakes by canoe or kayak."
427340,torco,2010-01-29 21:35:00,656,"It looks great, we rented on Redstone last year and it sounds similar. I love the idea of getting a canoe into some more remote lakes. Hopefully we'll be able to get the week we want. Its tough for us to find the right cottage because it includes my inlaws as well as dogs."

427613,fishboy,2010-01-30 16:46:00,550, yep...smallies and lakers
