428240,CLofchik,2010-02-01 05:33:00,854," Bwhaa haa haaa Feel the awesomeness, it just radiates from this lure      Okay to be clear, I tore that one apart myself just to show the internal rust buildup if (when) you do get water inside.  What killed it was a tiny pinhole on top where a 5lb. pike chunked the crappy finish.  It was fish #3 on this particular lure and it was done after that.  Even drum are killing these things for me because the cheapo body flexes so much it separates and let's water in, which rusts the cheap rattles, which kills the lure.  "
428351,adempsey,2010-02-01 16:46:00,1498,"It's probably important to keep in mind that not all lures are going to behave the same even though they are the exact same model.  Some just have that extra bit of movement or something unique that gives them that performance edge.  I remember reading once that some pros get large number of lures to try from their sponsors and test them to find just the right ones - even though they may all be the same model.  I don't know if that's true, but I don't doubt it.  Anyway, this isn't quite the same, but for me it was my Len Thompson Canadian Flag spoon.  I used it for several hours on Canada Day last year trying to land a pike or walleye.   Unfortunately, I got hung up on a deadhead and my lure is now in a watery grave.  Was rather disappointed.  However, I will not give up!  I will purchase another this year and give it a whirl on Canada Day 2010!!!  Hopefully I can find one.  As for the Storm, I haven't used many of the plastics yet.  I bought a ton of them when they were like $1 a bag.  I have used the Kickin'Minnow with success, but haven't even really tried the swim shads much."
428427,musky66,2010-02-01 20:34:00,273,Could try carrying nail polish or super glue and if you notice any teeth holes- coat them to prevent leakage. X Raps have been great for Pike in the Muskokas. Smithwick Rogues outperform all others when I troll for Walleye at dusk! I agree though- the Storm swimbaits look great- but have produced nothing for me!

427554,Cudz,2010-01-30 14:21:00,2652,"Here is a pic of my most dissapointing lures.  None of these lures have caught me a fish.  I have used them all for substantial periods of time and I have owned them all for at least 2 years.  I do still try to use them because most of these lures cost me close to between $10 and $20 each Starting on top of pic. 1. Bass Magnet Eyecatcher (Canadian company.  I really wanted it to work but no luck)  Catches your eye, not fish. That goes for most soft swimbaits for me as well. THey look great in the water but fail to produce. 2. Lucky Craft RC 2.5 Bream.  Great action, no fish ever. 3. Sebile Magic swimmer.  Everyone on the bass tour raves about it.  I have used it countless times in the past 2 years and have come up with a big goose egg!!!!! 4.  Sebile flatt shad.  Used it (both sizes) and had a follow up once 5. Lucky craft wander.  Very rare lure that can fished many ways.  When it sinks it wobbles just like a senko  Often called a hard senko.  No fish! 6. Bagley's chatter shad.  I have owned it for 22 years and no fish. 7. Rapala clacking rap (or whatever it is called).  Used it all last year and nothing. 8. Lucky craft pointer 78 and 100.  I lost my 100 and the 78 has caught me nothing. 9.Lucky craft sasara minnow.  Looks great but does not run properly.  Does not have any action at all.  I realize that others will have had success with these baits but not me.  I am pretty sure that one of my lures here the pointer 78 is Steve Robotham's favourite jerk bait.  lol In this pic is almost $200 of non fish-catching plastic!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! "

I know they are supposed to be a classic baits, but I can't get it to do anything. I haven't quite given up on it yet. Maybe I just can't fish glider type baits. I was kinda disappointed with my Hellhounds and Phantoms too. 3. Double showgirls and double bladed DC8s in different colors. I have a number of lures that didn't catch a musky last year, but some of them didn't get a lot of time in the water. I threw these a lot, and nothing to show for it. I'd put on a single bladed Mepps and catch fish."

Ripplin' Red Fin.....I think I haven't caught anything on those.  Almost impossible to tune right.  Storm swim baits......the walleye will hit them every now and then but the hooks are too heavy and won't penetrate past the barb no matter how sharp they are.  Walleye Diver.....maybe it goes too deep for the walleye in my area.  Norman Lures fat lures deep diving.....not expensive but no fish so far.  However, there are no bass in my region.  Jointed Rapalas ..... been using them for years.....no fish.  I find a few of them here and there, put them in my tackle box and lend them to others....still no fish.

427403,CLofchik,2010-01-30 01:48:00,854,"We've all had that feeling, browsing the aisles of the local tackle shop when that one shiny thingamajig catches your eye through the bubble packaging.  The luminescent, holographic, flourescent, triple grip forged hook, patented salty feeding stimulant scent....you just KNOW that it will just slay the fish if only given a chance.  Then you take your new prize home, lovingly release it from the three layers of packaging, a major reorganization of your tackle storage is attempted just to find a suitable compartment befitting it's future status as the unquestioned slayer of all fish.  Tackle reorganization is aborted twice after girlfriends puggle takes off with a bag of PowerBait, but eventually accomplished when the beast is finally pacified.  And it catches squat, gets banished to the forgotten corners of your box and is ignored except for the occasions when it becomes entangled with other, producing, lures.  Since it's restocking, daydreaming time and we're all looking at picking up a few things before the sun comes out again, which lures did diddly squat for you last season?  Here's my three that I had high hopes for, but had my bubble burst by the cold wet slobbering fishlips of reality...or lack thereof.  Rapala X-Rap, some people manage to catch fish with them but I never had much luck with them.  I did okay with them, but my main gripe is with their longevity, these have to be flimsiest piece of crap I've ever cast with.  Even drum were stripping paint, flexing the hollow body enough to leak and generally thrashing baits rather quickly for their price point.  I even went so far to do autopsies trying to figure out how to extend their life.  The internal rattles...they're made out of mild steel, so as soon as you have a leak it's only a short period of time before they rust together into a solid lump of crud.  Wasn't impressed for a $10 overpriced bait.      BPS Nitro Suspending Minnow, I liked the last version as a suspending jerkbait and medium running crank, and basically as a replacement for the crap X-Rap suspending jerkbait niche.  Caught a pile of fish from early spring pike to staging Chinooks and everything in between, they were great baits.  So naturally as something that's become a bit of a theme lately they had to be ""updated"" and totally ruined them.  They run alot shallower than they used to, the lip is too small to provide much action using it as a straight crankbait and they don't suspend level at all.  The paintjobs are tough & purty but other than some dink bass I never caught much on them.    Storm WildEye Swim Shad, these just ooze fishiness.  When I first picked a pouch up I just knew they were going to be deadly, they look really really great AND they were cheap.  Never caught a darn thing on them.  And they smell.  I've got six pouches of 4"" & 6"" if anybody wants them.  "

Now that's surprising. Are you rigging them properly? You need a swimbait hook with lead on the shank so they run true..
