He leans over and asks his neighbor if someone will be sitting there.  ""No"" says the neighbor. ""The seat is empty.""  ""This is incredible,"" said the man. ""Who in their right mind would have a seat like this for the Stanley Cup and not use it?""  The neighbor says, ""Well, actually, the seat belongs to me. I was supposed to come with my wife, but she passed away. This is the first Stanley Cup we haven't been to together since we got married.""  ""Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that. That's terrible... But couldn't you find someone else, a friend or relative, or even a neighbor to take the seat?"" The man shakes his head. ""No,” he says. “They're all at the funeral.""  On a seperate note. Made it the Lightning - Anaheim game while in Florida. Made down the glass by the third period in a couple empty seats next the vistors entrance, Turn out that was the V.I.P exit as well where I ended up with free drinks, sushi and a little mingling with Canadian Olympian.  Stamkos shot goal  Do I spot the Leafs new starting goalie?  Corey Perry  Scott Niedermeyer wanted a picture with me, so what could I say? "
