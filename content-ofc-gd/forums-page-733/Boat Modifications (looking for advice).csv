428396,archie_james_c,2010-02-01 19:43:00,618,  I assume they would use a sub frame under the floor. I am waiting for Princecraft to email me back about this.   ****This is not something I plan to do right here right now.....it's more less just a small thought in the back of my mind.******  If I ever want to go to an open concept boat I will more than likely just sell this one and get the boat I want. I am just discussing a hot topic to occupy my (our) minds till the soft water season   .  Think of it as...cabin fever
428399,archie_james_c,2010-02-01 19:45:00,618,"    Hey look at this...someone who didnt just jump to ""LEAVE IT THE HELL ALONE"" or ""JUST BUY IT FROM THE FACTORY""  As Drifter says, there is a right and wrong way to do it. Am I ever going to do this mod to my boat? Not likely. None the less is it entertaining for everyone to discuss this? Probably...  Flame suit on..."
428438,lookinforwalleye,2010-02-01 20:55:00,4399,what a Doh head!!!
427977,archie_james_c,2010-01-31 19:50:00,618,"I know there probably won't be alot of advice on this topic, but I am getting my new boat in a couple weeks. A Princecraft Holiday.  What I would like to know is if anyone has had experience removing the middle bench seat of their boats. I've been toying around with this idea so I could do an open concept floor design like the Holiday DLX.  Has anyone tried this on their boats and did you find that you lost any hull integrity? I can't imagine it would lose any durability as the 2005 Holiday DLX was the exact same hull as the standard Holiday but as said, without the damn ugly bench seats.  Here's some pics to show what I mean.  Standard 2005 Princecraft Holiday (measures 16' 4""L and 83"" W)    2005 Holiday DLX (full open floor and pedistal seats)  "
427985,lookinforwalleye,2010-01-31 19:58:00,4399,While I am no expert I would think that removing the middle bench would affect the hull`s integrity anyways I would suggest you contact the manufacturer for the right answer who better to ask.
427988,SBCregal,2010-01-31 20:02:00,688,"It looks like the floor in the bottom boat and the pieces up the side may provide some of the strength you'd lose when you remove the bench seat.  Also consider the flotation foam that is probably under the middle seat, you'd have to think about that as well.  Isn't the amount  AND the position of the flotation foam important to keeping the boat level in the event that it is swamped? I'd think that removing/moving it wouldn't be a problem any other time, but if it does happen...you may be in some trouble, if not on the water itself, but with your insurance company if they find it's been modified.  ryan"
427990,dave524,2010-01-31 20:03:00,4508,"I would also expect that seat is filled with level floatation material, another reason to leave it."
427993,Big Cliff,2010-01-31 20:08:00,6899,"I wouldn't do it, the floor in the DLX has to add strength and rigidity + you'll have to put some sort of a floor in if you want to mount a seat. By the time you add up all the work and materials you are going to have to put into the project you'd probably be better off selling yours and buying what you really want."
427994,archer379,2010-01-31 20:09:00,277,^^^ i agree with lookinfor if you look at the open floor model it has the floor and sides i am sure there ae pices underneth to compisate for the missing seat
427995,glen,2010-01-31 20:11:00,2641,If it was and old boat i would take out the middle bench.  If it is new and cost you a lot i would not.  Boats flex a lot and it might crack the hull or loosen the rivets. Put a flat floor in and step over the middle bench.  Make a casting deck on the front deck.
427996,archie_james_c,2010-01-31 20:16:00,618,"thanks for the advice guys. my plan is to put a flat floor and casting deck on it. I was hoping to be able to rid myself of the bench seat somewhere down the road and put in a full flat floor and side rod lockers and storage.  As for the advice of ""selling yours and getting the DLX"", well...mine was 4000$ even and the DLX is 16, 800$  ."
428001,Guest steel'n'esox,2010-01-31 20:26:00,0,"If its a new boat Im sure you would void any warranties on the hull, by doing the chop chop thing"
428002,John Bacon,2010-01-31 20:29:00,3277," Is that supposed to read $16,800 for a Holiday DLX?  Are you comparing the Holiday hull only to a Holiday DLX boat/motor/trailer package?  There is no way that a Holiday DLX would go that much for just a hull."
428003,archie_james_c,2010-01-31 20:35:00,618,"  Im sure it was a package. But even still if you cut that price in HALF, its still *twice* as much as what I paid for my Holiday   And yes, I'm aware that removing the seat would more than likely void the warranty.  Let's just say this is more of something thats been bouncing around in my head, NOT a 100% set in stone gameplan ."
428004,Muskieman,2010-01-31 20:41:00,2472,Warranty Void for sure.... But if you do do  any modifications do the the right way.  maybe like this?.. I felt like screwing around with my paint program.    RFS 
428006,archie_james_c,2010-01-31 20:44:00,618,"  Randy this is EXACTLY what I was looking for and what I had in mind!!  My plan for the casting deck is a big honkin livewell and a baitwell. add a pedistal seat mount and a bow mounted trolling motor off the front. The ""factory bow mount plate"" looks fairly easy to replicate.  i was thinking of using 1/2"" pressure treated plywood covered in marine vinyl coloured to match the inside of the hull. What do you think about the wood?"
428007,lookinforwalleye,2010-01-31 20:48:00,4399,"Loss of structural integrity, loss of floatation,loss of warranty seems to be cut and dried to me.  I would also think that you would pretty much kill the resale value I can`t imagine anybody buying it after it`s been compromised."
428008,archie_james_c,2010-01-31 20:49:00,618,  So how is it that princecraft made the DLX model on the same hull?
428011,Muskieman,2010-01-31 20:58:00,2472,  My Tracker has the same layout and the side storage compensates for rigidity I'm sure  RFS 
428014,HTHM,2010-01-31 21:02:00,4082,"NEVER EVER use Pressure treated wood on an alum boat!!!!!!!! The treatment is corrosive and you WILL get a hole where the wood meets the metal. If you wish to use ply, use marine grade plywood seal it with an epoxy or fiberglass resin  (all 6 sides) and you will have something that will last."
428015,lookinforwalleye,2010-01-31 21:03:00,4399,they may be the same hull on the outside but not on the inside I think that should be pretty obvious looking at the pictures.  Like I said previously you should talk to Princecraft to get the right answer but something tells me they will give you an answer that you wouldn`t like.
428016,archie_james_c,2010-01-31 21:10:00,618,  Sorry I meant marine grade
428227,POLLIWOGG,2010-02-01 04:28:00,835,Any modification or added equipment to any boat in Ca. is suposed to be done to the manufacturers specifications.  Transport Ca. put out a guide book for the pleasure craft courtesy check and there was something in there about modifying a boat and I'm pretty sure thats how it goes. I would imagine there are a lot of guys here that could have insurance issues. Simple as pedestal seats that throw off the stability of the boat could be a problem.
428232,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-02-01 04:39:00,0,"at a minimum i'd be concerned with this drastically impeding the boats performance...at a max, i'd be worried about how dangerous this could be! lol!"
428237,DRIFTER_016,2010-02-01 05:00:00,10439,Not dangerous if done correctly.  The DLX will have foam under the floor and in the side pods. Remember don't foam down the center so that water can still make it to the transom. And as said Never Ever use pressure treated wood for this.
428238,bigfish1965,2010-02-01 05:18:00,3382,Do they use some kind of struts/stringers under the floors to reduce torsional stress? That center bench would seem to be a major player in the dep't.
428255,Jer,2010-02-01 11:14:00,1426,"I would be very careful modifying a boat in this way.  My first boat was a used Grumman 16' aluminum that had been modified just like that. The middle bench had been removed and a full floor & casting decks were added. Within a few years, the entire hull started to split right along the line of the floor and the boat would leak like a sieve. By the time I found the full extent of the damage, the boat was scrap. I was lucky the hull didn't just peel right apart while out on the water one day."
428342,DRIFTER_016,2010-02-01 15:59:00,10439,  Yes.  If he's going to do it right they are required and should be aluminum and glued & rivetted to the hull. They should also be tied into the structure for the side bunks and sides of the hull as well.
