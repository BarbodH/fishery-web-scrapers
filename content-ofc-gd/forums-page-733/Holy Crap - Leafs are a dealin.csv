428115,JohnF,2010-02-01 00:28:00,3494, Yup. I'm sure Burke just got on the phone after last night's game and told his counterparts with the Ducks and the Flames that he'd decided they were gonna do this trade.  JF
428133,camillj,2010-02-01 01:09:00,1988,"... I am am OLD leafs fan ... one of those dinosaurs who actually saw them win their last Stanly cup and still think of them as the top team in the league (over the very long haul)  ... but I gotta admit ... its getting harder to make apologies for them ... I hate to see Stajan, Blake and Hagman go ... but then I hated to see Sundin and Roberts go ... I am not sure Toskala can be be held accountable .. and I agree .. White was a serious candidate for MVP ... so anyway .. here we go again ... I am breaking out the gravol right now because the whole thing is making me sick"
428134,ctdd2006,2010-02-01 01:16:00,531,  lol!  Well said...
428137,lookinforwalleye,2010-02-01 01:22:00,4399,You should happy to see Blake go I am sure Burke is doing cartwheels.  It will be interesting to see how Gigeure handles the Leafs in abillity to play defense.
428143,Raf,2010-02-01 01:28:00,3495," no doubt he's played well and competes game in, game out, tough to see him go -- i wont argue that but, is he a number 1 or 2 defenceman? personally, i dont think so.  i also dont think he's a guy to build a defense around whereas I think phaneuf can/will be.  he's only 24!!  i guess we will see!  the leafs have enough 3,4,5,6 guys."
428175,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-02-01 02:31:00,0,white was incredibly consistent.  it's a big loss on the offensive end as well.  that was 50 goals they got rid of from the offensive end! burkie must have another move up his sleeve... still hearing kaberle for sharp straight up.  that would be interesting.
428191,Jds63,2010-02-01 03:13:00,1365,"not sure what impact we are going to see from the other new additions but here is Giguere's stats for the last few seasons  ....  2005-2006	DUCKS	60	30	15 2006-2007	DUCKS	56	36	10 2007-2008	DUCKS	58	35	17 2008-2009	DUCKS	46	19	18 2009-2010	DUCKS	20	4	8  the 3 columns are Games Played , Wins , Losses ....  06 and 07 looked pretty good but 08 and this year don't look that great ... and this year looks like Anaheim has given up on him ....is he supposed to be the Leafs new #1 or a backup to Gustavvson ?  I don't get it ..."
428197,SBCregal,2010-02-01 03:21:00,688,didnt he play for burke in anaheim in the seasons where he played well? Allaire was there at those times as well.
428212,love2fishhave2work,2010-02-01 03:50:00,212, I would have taken a broken stick and a pair of old skates for toskala.  Great moves today all around.
428246,MuskyGreenHorn,2010-02-01 06:26:00,158,"I grew up a leaf man but gave up on them years ago,  basically they just took out the trash and its about time.  There is still more to go... Burke and Wilson are the only ones that have enough balls to get anything done with the Leafs.  And for eeryone moaning about losing White, its easy to look good when you are compared to everyone else on the leafs roster.  Now if they could only get some fans who booed them when they sucked, they might some motivation.. So typical, every leaf fan defends them to the bitter end.... Ever been to a montreal or Pittsburg Game? The fans are Rithless and Its awesome. They get chewed out in public when they stink and then they smarten up."
428282,canadadude,2010-02-01 13:21:00,769,"Giguere has a Stanley cup ring and a con smyth trophy while playing for burke, he also is reaquainted with the best goalie coach he ever had so things may turn around for him big time. This will probably be the best opportunity he has to turn his game back on and reach the potential greatness he showed early in his career.As for Ian White his numbers are about the same as Phaneuf this year but phaneuf is having a bad season. I think White is at his full potential right now and I think Phaneuf is playing below his potential so straight up I think Phaneuf is by far a more effective player.  Why do leaf fans want to trade Kaberle so bad, he's by far the best defence men that team has seen in years, check out his numbers he's consistantly in the top 5 defencemen in the league, while playing on a dismal leaf team He stays out of the penalty box aswell, theres 25 other leafs I dump before Kaberle infact I'd be keeping that boy around for awhile."
428343,Jds63,2010-02-01 16:10:00,1365,"Well, seems like the numbers that the Loafs are on the hook for now is pretty big; A 7 million dollar goaltender ????  he better put up some wins !!! he's only got 4 this year ...   Excerpt taken from SLAM Sports The moves also give Toronto a pair of big-salary players. Phaneuf earns $6.5 million this year - the second of a $39-million, six-year pact - while Giguere will make $6 million this season and $7 million in 2010-11.  Sjostrom is at $750,000.  Asked about the salary cap situation, Burke said it was manageable.  ""At the end of the day, with this trade I think we end up pretty close to where we were,"" said Burke.  Hagman makes $3 million, Stajan $1.75 million, Mayers $1.4 million and White $950,000. Stajan and Mayers are unrestricted free agents on July 1, while White will be a restricted free agent.  Blake has two years left on a $20-million, five-year deal. He'll make $3 million next season.   http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Hockey/NHL/Toron...2685511-cp.html"
428574,jjcanoe,2010-02-02 02:27:00,744," I think Steve Simmons (Sun Media sports troublemaker Uh I mean writer) is trying to run him out of town the same way he did to Mogilny, Sundin, McCabe, and others.  If you read his chicken scratchings, anytime a player is slumping they're overpaid, and if they're doing well it's time to get rid of them and get what little value we can before the player is worthless again.  (nice recurring theme in his columns)  jjcanoe"
427903,Jds63,2010-01-31 17:17:00,1365,"The Flames have dealt Dion Phaneuf, Fredrik Sjostrom and Keith Aulie to Leafs for Matt Stajan, Niklas Hagman, Jamal Mayers and Ian White.    All right all the armchair analysts out there ... the crap just hit the fan in Leaf world .... let the discussion begin .... Good or Bad ?  Not sure what the results will be yet !! no details on draft picks or cost !!!    I also heard Giguere for Toskala"
427905,blarg,2010-01-31 17:22:00,289,"Burke snapped after watching the Sedins beat up on the leafs last night!    Well, they couldn't be any worse, could they?"
427906,uglyfish,2010-01-31 17:22:00,981,"lol i just posted the same thing. but didnt know the details.  im extatic to have phaneuf, but sad to see hagman go, cause he was really starting to pick up his play. stajan never played to his potential... but IAN WHITE????? there better be plans to sign him back in the off season, he was the best player on the team all year, hands down!!  im hearing giguere and a 1st rounder for toskola. personally, thats a VERY high price for toskola... a stick and 2 pucks seems more fair of a deal to me.. lol, but if burke got that, good on him."
427911,blarg,2010-01-31 17:39:00,289,"Giguere is going to cost the leafs more than toskala, and Ian white was going to be expecting more money that the leafs were willing to pay him.   Rumor now is Blake is in the deal and leafs get a first rounder along with giguere"
427917,uglyfish,2010-01-31 18:03:00,981,burke said he would take on salary to aquire draft picks. which is evident in the toskola-giguere  deal. white was well worth the raise he is gonna get in the off season. i really hope there is a deal in place to resign him in the off season. he has been their best player hands down all year. and last year as well. he plays both ends of the ice
427919,uglyfish,2010-01-31 18:05:00,981,"and for a team that cant score, trading ur leading scorer isnt gonna help that matter much. mayers was no shock as he requested a trade. and it was a matter of time for stajan. as he has been called out nurmous time this year by management."
427923,lookinforwalleye,2010-01-31 18:12:00,4399,Obviously Phaneuf is a quality defenseman but the leafs give up their 2nd and 3rd highest scoring forwards and a pretty good D`man in White. This will put more pressure of Kessel to score more goals.  If the Leafs can get Giguere that would help as Toskala just plain stinks and the Monster has proven one thing so far is that he is not ready for the NHL.
427924,smitter,2010-01-31 18:13:00,106,"Phaneuf is one of my favorite players. He's had a terrible year in Calgary, hopefully a change of venue will turn him around.  It will be great to see him in a Leafs uniform."
427927,uglyfish,2010-01-31 18:22:00,981,  i agree!! now we know the leafs will be looking for at least 2 top line forwards in the off season now. they need a number one playmaking center and another scoring winger
427934,lookinforwalleye,2010-01-31 18:32:00,4399,"Apparently the Giguere deal is done, Toskala and Blake.  I give props to Burke for getting rid of two overpaid bums and getting something useful in return albiet a big contract in Giguere who is having a sub par year."
427935,muskymatt,2010-01-31 18:32:00,2608,OMG....the leafs made a trade?????  Better get the parade route ready!!!!
427939,dave524,2010-01-31 18:44:00,4508,"Doing a rough head count , looks like a couple of Marlies are going to be called up to fill a few spots."
427943,uglyfish,2010-01-31 18:52:00,981,"i didnt know blake was part of that deal he just cleared some serious salary from the team. and salary from some totally useless players. i feel for the ducks though.,.. noew that have a high payed useless winger who plays well once every 12 games or so. and a goalie who cant stop a shot to save his life, has horrible positioning and some of the worst rebound control the game has ever seen!  now, if we can get rid of jeff finger and his 4 mil per year joke of a contract for a guy who was number 7 on colorados depth chart before ferguson signed him we'll be ok."
427945,solopaddler,2010-01-31 18:55:00,8605,"If true this deal is on par with the one that brought Dougie to the Leafs from Calgary. It seems Calgary has a history now of overspending to aquire Torontos dregs.  Also I'm amazed anyone picked up Blakes contract, wow. That's huge."
427954,holdfast,2010-01-31 19:12:00,1813,"OH my god, four Leafs to Calgary.  THE VIRUS IS SPREADING"
427965,Fang,2010-01-31 19:31:00,1330,Now what are we gonna get for Kaberle. I like these moves. A number one goalie for sure and someone on defense who can scare the crap out of the other teams forwards.
427975,SBCregal,2010-01-31 19:44:00,688,"From mapleleafs.com  Toskala, Blake, White, Hagman, Stajan and Mayers gone  Phaneuf, Giguere, Aulie and Sjorostom to Toronto  hopefully Giguere will be able to do something Toskala couldn't now that he is reunited with Burke and Francois Allaire (goaltending coach) With Toronto at the bottom of the league in goals allowed and 16th in goals for, maybe giving up a bit of scoring for some defence and a goalie isnt a horrible idea...we'll see"
428018,bucktail,2010-01-31 21:12:00,1857,"I love Phaneuf but how can this possibly help this team??????????????????? They cant score into an empty net! They need to get rid of Burke , they will soon have the lowest scoring team in leagus history!"
428022,jjcanoe,2010-01-31 21:18:00,744,"White, Hagman, Kaberle were my 3 picks for team MVP this year(I guess Kaberle wins by default now)  I hope they can get either White or Hagman back this off season They were seemingly the only producers on the team this year.  The Jiggy deal, is another example of picking up a star well past their prime (Lindros, Leetch, Francis to name a few)  jjcanoe"
428023,Roy,2010-01-31 21:19:00,13728, And so will team #4
428024,bucktail,2010-01-31 21:29:00,1857,Team 4 is in a rebuilding season!!
428030,atvaholic,2010-01-31 21:49:00,271,"Good for burk to get phaneuf, sad to see Ian white go. Didnt mind Hagman either but totally elated that Blake and toskala are gone! Still gonna be a completly tanked season, nobody can score. I hope giggy can stop a few pucks."
428091,Raf,2010-01-31 23:42:00,3495,"i like phaneuf lots.  only 24 and i think he'll figure into their future well.   i am sure he will return to his form of a few seasons ago.  for a rebuilding team, trading a bunch of 2,3,4 liners for a top 2 d-man is a good move IMO.  white was a good player but will never be a top 2 dman.  the others 3rd and 4th liners on any team besides the leafs."
428100,jediangler,2010-02-01 00:02:00,1923,Burke had to do something after last nights epic fail to the hands of the Canucks or else the papers and tv sports guys would be talking about that game all week. Now they will be talking about the trades and that game will be forgotten.
428105,uglyfish,2010-02-01 00:08:00,981,"  dunno what uve been watchin, but white has been their best player the past 2 years. and he could easily be a top 2 D man on any team in the league. hes as tough as they come, plays hard, hes excellant in his own end and smart in the offensive end. has a bullet shot, makes great passes and can skate very well."
