428548,bigugli,2010-02-02 01:18:00,6138,"With the Erie area ice firming up after last weeks thaw, it was time for some smelting. Been very busy the past 2 days. They are a bit smaller than last year's average, but there are still some good sized smelt around.   Even the son's squeeze was getting into the act and having a blast despite the raw winds   One of the piles to be cut and cleaned.   The reward at the end of it all.   Even when smelting I set out a minnow for the odd perch that might be around. What a surprise I got.  Saw this little nibble action so I set the hook expecting a dink perch. Felt this solid weight at the other end and it started to take off. Now the rig is one of those hand made jobs; an 18"" piece from a broken rod, a piece of wood,  one Southbend disc reel ( on clearance for a buck) 4lb line and a teardrop and minnow. So here I'm frantically trying to get the keeper out before the line snaps, then I'm trying to work this beastie in and palming this pathetic reel every time  it takes off. Every time he sees the hole he takes off again and I just let him. Finally, this time, I get him in.  What a blast. must have spent a good 10 minutes laughing. There is nothing so satisfying as seeing one of your own gadgets or creations working successfully. The evidence:   Anyhow, back to cleaning some more smelt."
