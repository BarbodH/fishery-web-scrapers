427961,tjsa,2010-01-31 19:24:00,1578,"what parts?????  never needed any parts for my old 10"" other than spare spark plug and blades. Same with my newer 2 hp 8"" model."
427966,Sinker,2010-01-31 19:33:00,8692,Any small engine repair shop should be able to get parts.
427986,Big Cliff,2010-01-31 19:58:00,6899,"Like Tjsa said, what parts do you need? If it is a carb kit I might have one here. Call me 705-328-0577"

428025,tjsa,2010-01-31 21:32:00,1578,"Probably are places that other guys can steer you to, but why not e-mail Jiffy directly. I did years ago looking for a place to buy some stickers to put on my custom made auger box, and they sent me almost a dozen stickers free of charge. Same thing happened when I e-mailed Daiwa direct about bail springs for a reel of theirs I had 4 of, not complaining, just looking for a retailer or authorized maintenance shop in Ontario. They sent me 3 replacement bail springs for free.  Worth a shot, or an e-mail."
