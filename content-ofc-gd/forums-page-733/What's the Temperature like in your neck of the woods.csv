427890,tjsa,2010-01-31 16:04:00,1578,"Since last Monday night, we have been in -25ish overnight lows to -16ish highs. Colder outside of Thunder Bay. Forecasted to be -22C overnight tonight, feels like -31 with the wind chill. -19C right now, high of -16C forecasted for today. Its not that bad with sunny skies and the wind does not get any more than 10 kmh, but when it gets to 15 kmh, it feels a lot colder."
427892,DRIFTER_016,2010-01-31 16:14:00,10439,  Since November we have been in -25ish highs. Most times colder a few times warmer.    Currently a balmy -33.
427952,Leecher,2010-01-31 19:10:00,7832, Sounds like a cold spell to me Tom.... hopefully it won't last too long and get back into seasonal temps later on   You must getting anxious to see the temps raise onto teens so that you can go out fishing hey Dave
427989,tjsa,2010-01-31 20:03:00,1578,"Jacques, the cold spell started just after christmas into the new year, then warmer temps reaching 0C overnight last sunday, then dipping down last monday to what it is now. Long range forecast looks like a warming trend starting wednesday, for how long, who knows. But, whatever, been dealing with it for many years up here."
427997,holdfast,2010-01-31 20:16:00,1813,"Do you really want to know? put it this way, when they say a high of minus 15, Ill put my skates on and give it a whirl till my toes freeze.  About 30 minutes"
427999,Leecher,2010-01-31 20:25:00,7832," Over here, it's been pretty warm so far except for the spells..... rivers, Ottawa and Gatineau aren't fully frozen yet in some parts which is really unusual for this time of year.  Today had a good 16""+ of ice on the lake I targeted compared to last week which was 13"".  Like you said ""who knows"" is what we have to deal with so far.  I don't think I would venture out on the big lakes up here simply because I don't know what the ice thickness is with this crazy weather."
428063,DRIFTER_016,2010-01-31 22:53:00,10439, You bet!!!! Won't be long  now. I've got some vacation time booked for the end of March beginning of April. A buddy and I are heading to the East arm of Great Slave to try and ice some giant Lakers. My buddy has one of these for us to hold up in when we're not fishing.    We will probably spend a week or so exploring out there and then hit some other big trout lakes when we get bored.
428072,Greencoachdog,2010-01-31 23:02:00,8163,It got up to 59*F for a couple hours here today. There was a piercing northerly breeze on the north side of the house... but the patio on the south side was almost like being in Florida!

427576,DRIFTER_016,2010-01-30 15:17:00,10439,"-31 right now in Yellowknife -36 windchill. Too cold for me to go out ice fishing. Could be worse though, it was -49 with no wind before Christmas. I usually don't head out when it's colder than -25. Guess I'm a wuss. I am getting a little ice fishing fix watching Bob Izumi catching bows and brookies through the ice."
427580,Leecher,2010-01-30 15:24:00,7832," :w00t:   Down here it's humidity that's killer.... gone up to 64% I'm same as you, don't go out when it's too cold.  Right now, where I'm sitting it's 22C and I ain't moving"
427622,DRIFTER_016,2010-01-30 17:02:00,10439,  52% humidity here right now so not quite as damp.
427648,Dabluz,2010-01-30 18:09:00,701,"We've had a rotten year so far in my area.  Winter came very late.  The Saguenay river does not have much ice and where I set up my fish hut, there is no ice yet and the area is closed.  So far, we got about 1/3 of the normal snow fall.  It's either very cold or too warm with rain.  Been in the - 20's all week.  Should get quite a bit warmer after the weekend."
