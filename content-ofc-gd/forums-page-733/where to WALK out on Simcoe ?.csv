Ice fished once lasrt year out of Beaverton with a freinds ATV.Just wondering where a good place to walk out from might be.Coming up from the south.I've looked at hydro maps and followed the threads.Is it worth my while to leave from the public parking @ Willow Beach?   Thanks"
428118,Fish Farmer,2010-02-01 00:41:00,2234,"You can walk out pretty much anywhere around Simcoe, were there is access. All depends what your fishing for. Just watch were you park!!!!! AND Make sure the ice is safe!!!!! Good Luck"

428305,Headhunter,2010-02-01 14:02:00,5703,"if it's perch you want, walk out from Gilford... start at 10-12 ft and work your way out as the day goes on... 20-25 ft by mid day. Be careful where you park there and yes... minnows are available there should you require. HH"
