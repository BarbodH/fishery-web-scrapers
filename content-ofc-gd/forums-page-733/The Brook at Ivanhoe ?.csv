427253,davew3,2010-01-29 16:13:00,430,Good day folks.  Well six of us are planning to rent the Brook for a week in July.  I see that other people have spent time on Ivanhoe.  Can any of you pass on any tips for our stay there? Not just fishing but anything else we could or should be aware of. It would be appreciated.  Regards.

Crankbaits produced some of our biggest eyes too, but the 1-5lb pike kept getting in the way.  One early morning we did really well slowly trolling worm harnesses on bottom bouncers against current.  That was our best day....numbers and size!"
