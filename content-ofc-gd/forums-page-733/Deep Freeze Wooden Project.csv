427959,Leecher,2010-01-31 19:23:00,7832, LOL  yeah it certainly can be used that way As for a name..... haven't decided yet but how's about Little PINKY   It sure did John   Batteries not included Chanco I'm not answering the second question   Very funny Steve     I'll just keep it for me then   Don't be afraid Chris.... the guys have a funny sense of humour and it's cracking me up   :lol: Thanks man!!!
427967,Leecher,2010-01-31 19:34:00,7832," Thanks Fish Farmer!!!  Haven't tried it yet, except for the sink test and yes before I had the front of it round, would lay on it's side.  Now I'm thinking, after adding three sets of the biggest treble hooks on it, will sit properly on the soft surface...... If I'm wrong, well it's going to be added to the trophy wall as an exhibition   It's coming Rich     Just be patient will ya   LOL Noted splashhopper!!!      LOL Glen..... I like LITLLE PINKY"
427969,Spiel,2010-01-31 19:38:00,9065,"I think you should call it ""The Intruder"", nuff said."
427972,Leecher,2010-01-31 19:42:00,7832, Ohhhhh my my my   Good one Chris I..... cough cough like it cough cough
427974,dave524,2010-01-31 19:43:00,4508,"Just a thought, I would think the wooden diving lips are adding floatation exactly where you don't want it, on the bottom. Maybe hunt up some clear lexan or acrylic material and cut out your lip on a jig saw and epoxy it into a fine saw cut, could help with the attitude in the water."
427978,Leecher,2010-01-31 19:50:00,7832,"  Good point Dave    I had a similar problem with the first one I made last year, the Little Woody.  What I ended up doing is drill a hole into the under side of the front part and inserting a cone shape lead, sealing it with epoxy...... it helped stabilize the lure after casting it...... might just have to do the same with this one."
427984,Spiel,2010-01-31 19:56:00,9065,  That's definitely something you should consider Jacques. Once the lure is constructed with a plastic type lip you can fine tune it by trimming as needed. Also if it ever breaks off it can be replaced with a little effort.
427992,Leecher,2010-01-31 20:07:00,7832, Thanks Chris   It make sense and will certainly consider it for sure
428020,bushart,2010-01-31 21:15:00,2628,Hey Jacques  Glad I did'nt volunteer to paint this project cause----accordin to legend-----Ya'd hafta paint it black

427735,Leecher,2010-01-30 23:19:00,7832,"Ok guys, mother nature is not nice to throw us in the deep freeze like that, so instead of going out and freeze my butt, decided to stay in the comfort of my home and hit the workshop  Been working on this project for the last week and today finally been able to apply a few coats of paint.  Now you probably seen this pic in my previous thread    These are the pieces I started with.... those are from the picture frames I did for my dad before he past away last year.  Had some left overs and thought I would use, so not to waste them.  Glued them together and after some thinking and measuring, proceeded to the band saw and cut out the outline I had traced..... here's the result Took a pic next to a 5"" one to give you perspective    Now big was what I plan on creating and big is the results    Not having the front of the piece round, had to improvise...... now for those that follow my wooden projects know what I mean.  After a tremendous amount of gluing and sanding, was not achieving  the results I wanted so had to bring in another product into play ""Plastic wood""  Several coats were applied and sanded and a couple of white coat, only to achieve this result    Another    Now all that's remaining is the color pattern so stay tune for an update..... will keep you posted Hope you enjoy Leechman"

427845,Fish Farmer,2010-01-31 13:09:00,2234,"Leech, have you tried them out? I made some body baits years ago, spent days on them to find out they just laid on there side when retrieved  . I did my trials in my neighbors pool.   He told me I had a real problem with my addiction of fishing,   casting in his pool. Some people just don't under stand.   Or maybe he was worried about his liner. Good work Leech on the first one ,but I don't want to comment on the last one, my wife seen me looking at your thread and said you guys are sick.   I still don't know what she was talking about."
