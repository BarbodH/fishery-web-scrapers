428194,johnston1010,2010-02-01 03:15:00,12,next summer I'm foaming at the mouth to do some bass fishing on some docks tell me whats working for you and what part of the lake is doing good.
428195,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-02-01 03:20:00,0,the flying lure!
428196,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-02-01 03:21:00,0,"seriously though, i'd say a spinnerbait or some plastics.  lots of the largie guys on here seem to dig the senko."
428198,BillM,2010-02-01 03:22:00,17367," My dad bought some of those  :)  But I gotta admit, they work pretty good!!!   Although I much prefer dropping a senko at the side of the dock and teasing those big bass out."
428200,Leecher,2010-02-01 03:25:00,7832," Can't help ya with the lake part.... I'm sure someone will chime in but as far as lures goes for bass, here's a few of them  BigO (white & chartreuse), Jitterbug (leopard green), spinnerbait (white, yellow,chartreuse) just to name a few..... powerbaits 5"" sinking minnow (black), 7"" minnow worm (pumpkingseed, cherry seed)  I'm sure there are other lures but this is what comes off the top of my head for bass fishing Leechman"
428257,Jer,2010-02-01 11:37:00,1426,"Apparently through the ice, all you need is a tiny teardrop jig with a Gulp minnow head. I got (and immediately released of course) a 3 lb largemouth just yesterday on Chemong. A bunch of perch and a few sunfish also liked the offering.  For summertime bassin'. it's hard to beat a senko-type bait, wacky rigged for flippin' under docks. Early morning and in the evening, throw a topwater like a Pop'R out there. Most of the lake holds good largemouth and smallmouth."
428263,Blake,2010-02-01 12:23:00,418,"Chemong Dock fishing can be awesome certain times of the year.  Look in the North/west areas and pick out the best looking docks and you should get a few heavy hitters there.  Baits that I have used with success are the Strike King Coffee Tube rigged weightless on a 4/0 hook, a 3/8oz Mop Jig in Black/blue/purple and also a Phenix C Worm in Black and bubblegum."
428332,lhousesoccer,2010-02-01 15:30:00,442,"Get some of these:  TitleShot Skip Jig  Match it with a 3"" creature bait of your choice, and learn how to skip a jig on spinning gear with 8-lb or 10-lb braid.  Hit every corner of the dock, hit every leg on the dock.  Skip it as far back as you can.  Let it sink on semi-slack line (so it doesn't pedulum away from your target) and watch for line movement.  You'll almost never feel the hit.  In shallow water under docks, bass can inhale and spit out your lure as it sinks before you realize anything has happened.  Practice and more practice.  But skipping is awesome once you learn how.  "
428337,mbosh1980,2010-02-01 15:50:00,349,not sure about chemong but a couple lakes over I had some good success with a wake-style crankbait. Cover lots of water and the fish aren't too wary of them yet it seems.
428499,bare foot wader,2010-02-01 23:02:00,1354,"I'd recommend being respectful of people's property....not saying nothing about your character at all, just giving ya a heads up is all....because odds are you will encounter a jackass out there....especially on chemong, I have lots of hours on that lake, lived in ptbo for 4 yrs....  if you see somebody out and about on their dock politely ask if you can fish it before hand.....if you're flipping jigs or whatever make sure you're decently accurate, try not to be bouncing off hulls and scratching somebody's gelcoat....  touchy subject and I personally can see the merit from both sides..."
428501,BillM,2010-02-01 23:08:00,17367,"  If someone is out on their dock, I don't even bother fishing it.  I just say hello and move on to the next."
