428233,Jeff_C,2010-02-01 04:47:00,50,"We had a great day on Saturday catching lots of fish from varying year classes. The smallest would have been 14-15"" and up to 29"". (I know of at least one even larger one that won the tug of war battle.) There were quite a few in the 5-7lb range. One angler caught his first walleye and his first pike! Congrats! The cold yesterday just made for rosy cheeks on smiling faces.  I will put up even more pics within a couple of days.  There has been lots of discussion around unsafe ice, and this is great. Even where there is 10+ inches of ice still, there are pressure cracks that you do not want to put a machine anywhere near. Seeing as the ice is pretty much void of snow, you probably want to keep your speed down as well when venturing around especially in the dark. If you were to come up on a pressure crack at a higher speed, you probably couldn't get stopped in time.  If you take your time, do your homework, and keep safety first, there are lots of places to fish with great ice that are holding fish.  Jeff                 "
