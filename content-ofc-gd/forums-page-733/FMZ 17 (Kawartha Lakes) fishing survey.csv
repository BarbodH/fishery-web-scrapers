Folks,  I just wanted to provide a quick   update on some initiatives we are working on to collect information associated   with the winter fishery.  The Kawartha Lakes Fisheries   Assessment Unit have implemented an aerial creel program that is collecting   information on a number of lakes across the zone. This is allowing us to get   counts of anglers and ice huts which will allow us to assess the use of the new   opportunities. This will continue throughout the rest of the   season.  In addition, the FAU and the   District are working on conducting some 'on-ice' angler creels, which involves   interviewing anglers about their fishing trips. We're trying to cover as many   lakes as possible and will continue to do this throughout the remainder of the   season.  The part that may be of most   interest to you is a voluntary angler diary program we have set up, which is   accessible on-line (www.fmz17survey.ca). We are hoping that   anglers (yourselves included) will provide information on their angling   activities. This is a pilot project and it will be interesting to see how much   feedback we are able to get. I'd appreciate if you would distribute the link and   encourage anglers to complete the survey after each of their trips. It should   only take 5 minutes or less to complete the survey and it will be interesting to   see what information that provides for us. All information, including   unsuccessful trips and information on incidental catches, is   important."
