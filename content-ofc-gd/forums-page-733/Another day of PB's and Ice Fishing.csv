427787,MCTFisher9120,2010-01-31 01:26:00,3761,"Went out to simcoe today with a few friends and rented out two huts and fished with minimal success. Caught only 2 fish 1 being a 11lb 5oz Lake Trout(PB) and a 3lb 8oz whitefish also a first for myself.  We were fishing in about 47-48 feet of water under the hit and had a great time with the friends.  Picture of the hut;   And the picture of me with the Lake Trout and the Whitefish, a friend wanted the whitefish and the laketrout was bleeding like crazy so my friend kept that also. I didn't mind but what a fight that was to catch!    Thanks for reading/viewing. Off to Couch tomorrow for some perch action! MTBF  O and sorry team, my sign was at home"

427827,MCTFisher9120,2010-01-31 09:14:00,3761,"O ya, lol. I keep forgetting it's not actually the start of the 2010 Tournament. We were just on Simcoe from what I was told, and they were caught on a 3 way rig the man called them. Heavy weight with 2 hooks on like 3"" of line in a triangle...let it sit on bottom and slowly bring it up from time to time."
