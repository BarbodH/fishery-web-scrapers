428407,Doop,2010-02-01 20:00:00,22,Does Ontario have a hunting forum? I am trying to find an outfitter to use for my 1st trip hunting trip to the provinces.  Thank you!

428451,JohnAB,2010-02-01 21:28:00,178,In Alberta here. Our main hunting forum is www.outdoorsmenforum.ca  Lots of people there to help you out. What are you looking to hunt for?
