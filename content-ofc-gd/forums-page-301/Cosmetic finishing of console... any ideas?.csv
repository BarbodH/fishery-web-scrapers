Anyways I'm looking for thin plastic corner molding to clean it all up.  I've seen 1/2"" plastic corners at home depot etc. and have seen the rubber stuff for bathtub/sink corners but not exactly what I had in mind.  Any ideas would be appreciated.  I've included 2 images - one of rocker panel and one of my idea...  Basically cutting the top off a plastic waste basket exactly 9"" X 12"" would be perfect but the dollar store isn't taking custom requests!  "
793128,SlowPoke,2013-06-17 19:24:00,2984,I would go with an aluminium J mold using the long side on the inner wall of the recess. Aluminium can be cut with wood blades so getting your miters shouldn't be too much trouble on a miter saw. http://www.eagle-aluminum.com/Aluminum-J-Cap--curved-face-drip-rail_p_186.html
