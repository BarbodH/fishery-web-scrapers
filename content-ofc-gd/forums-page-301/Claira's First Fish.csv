792937,The Urban Fisherman,2013-06-17 00:43:00,2050,"Well here's the report I promised.  My youngest daughter Claira has been on my case to get out fishing since the ice came off hte lake.  Our new vehicle doesn't have a hitch yet and we only had a short window to get out so we packed up the family and took Claira out for a little shore fishing.  There's a great little spot to take the kids on Longpoint and it's always loaded with small bluegill, perch, rockbass etc.  As soon as we dropped Claira's pink trout worm into the lake a solid 2lb+ largie smashed it and started spooling her little rod.  I grabbed the spool in a panic and you guessed it... SNAP.. her first fish would have  been a nice largie and but her dad blew it and it broke her off.  It's all good though because within a few minutes we had her tied back up and and at two years old she caught her first ever fish all by herself with zero help from Dad!! She was very excited but still wouldn't hold it, so big sis showed her how it's done.    We stuck around for about 45 minutes and the kids caught a whole bunch of little bluegill... not the Deer Creek giants we're used to, but hte kids had a ton of fun and it was good to get outside and catch some fish.  Here's my boy Luke with his first of the day..   Averie with a pair... ( one on her rod and one on mine while I was helping Luke un-hook his fish )    Mom even got in on the action a little today...    A few more fish.....          And it was time to call it a day!    Thanks for checkin out our report - have a great week!!  Cheers, Ryan"

792947,Musky or Specks,2013-06-17 00:56:00,2710,What a great fathers day. Averie is such a vet fisherperson.
792962,ccmtcanada,2013-06-17 01:19:00,7971,Absolutely love these kinds of reports!  Congrats on her first fish....but know it should have been a 2 lb large.  Lol.  Excellent report and happy Father's Day!
793019,asdve23rveavwa,2013-06-17 10:40:00,2690,Awesome stuff buddy! Pretty soon her and Averie will both be ferocious fishergirls!
793080,alphaalpha,2013-06-17 16:14:00,475,"Great report,  thanks for sharing.  My oldest boy turns two at the end of the month but he definitely isn't coordinated enough to handle a rod solo yet.  Shouldn't be too long tho.  -AA"

793168,wildeye rainbow,2013-06-17 22:46:00,123,Nice report. It brings back memories when I took the kids down to Pinafore for panfish.  WR
793175,Rich,2013-06-17 23:16:00,3927,Great report Ryan. Life is good.
793185,spincast,2013-06-17 23:47:00,3279,best catch of the day ... the smiles of our kids as they display their catch - cool report
793259,irishfield,2013-06-18 03:46:00,26272,"I've told you before Ryan.. thanks for these posts and bringing back some great memories that go with them for me. Super young parents, 3 kids... a duplicate of Leah and I about 22 years ago... but with the boy being the oldest. Enjoy it to the fullest!"
793271,Toad Hunter,2013-06-18 06:00:00,261,"more action than I've seen since Sept.  . I really can't wait to get out myself, but in 4 years when my wee boss is old enough to have him join me that will be the real thrill. Great roots your planting right there."
793303,The Urban Fisherman,2013-06-18 13:33:00,2050,Thanks for the great response guys!  Sometimes  I wonder wether or not anyone want's to see more pics of my kids holding little bluegill but I will keep posting for sure.  T-minus 5 days until you get a real bass report out of me.  This year is going to be Averie's first bass opener on Longpoint!
