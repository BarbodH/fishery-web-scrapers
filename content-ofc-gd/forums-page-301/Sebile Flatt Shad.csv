I ask because my sister picked one up for me and it being the shad style I figure what the hell, but it's a sinking lure with no spoon which is odd and the ring placement is on the top of the head instead of at the front.  If anyone has had any experience with these (good or bad) and a good way to utilize them let me know! watching their videos they say its good for rip jigging, trolling or just casting, so I'm going to try out any way I can, also they wrote if you snip the front treble it helps it a lot through the weeds if casting into them.  I'd like to target walleye with them so hopefully it helps! as the CC shad has been a staple in my tackle for them for some time now.  http://www.cabelas.com/product/Sebile-Flatt-Shad/704712.uts?Ntk=AllProducts&searchPath=%2Fcatalog%2Fsearch.cmd%3FN%3D0%26Ntk%3DAllProducts%26Ntt%3Dsebile%2Bfishing%2Blures%26WT.srch%3D1%26WT.tsrc%3DPPC%26WT.mc_id%3Dgoogle|fis_Hard%2BBaits_general|USA%26WT.z_mc_id1%3DsIFCRzqrR%26rid%3D20%26pcrid%3D12987128898%26gclid%3DCLiW6sKC6bcCFSJqMgodn2UA8A&Ntt=sebile+fishing+lures&WTz_l=PPC  Thanks for any input!
