I keep checking the weather and each time it changes all over the place. Hate the weather man, is it worth getting out for the second time but getting soaked while at it.. Ahh. Already missed the quite bass tourney because of work, sucks!"
792685,SirWhite,2013-06-15 18:42:00,210,Planned a half day trip up to Lower Buckhorn for tomorrow. Never been before. I've got three apps running all day tracking this storm. Might pull it off. Looks like the rain is concentrated in bands that have 2 and a half hour windows. Risky but big payoff coldfront possibilities.  Fingers crossed

792698,kickingfrog,2013-06-15 20:59:00,8333,I picked today because Sunday didn't look good for Simcoe.

792754,Dan668,2013-06-16 03:11:00,1120,"I know, my parents think im crazy wanting to get out to catch a fish in the rain. If only i lived closer, would hate to drive up there and have downpour like conditions."
