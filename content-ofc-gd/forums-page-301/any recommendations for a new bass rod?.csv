793147,boombap,2013-06-17 21:35:00,310,"Shimano crucial Or a cheaper route, st. croix mojo bass- great rod for the money"
793150,Dan668,2013-06-17 21:42:00,1120,dobyns savvy 733 or a shimano crucial.
793151,musky_hunter,2013-06-17 21:46:00,328,"The dobyns is more sensitive and balanced compared to the new crucial. I prefer the old ones. The new ones feels dead, lost its crispness."
793172,lookinforwalleye,2013-06-17 23:03:00,4399,"Stick with Shimano, a Compre or Crucial are nice rods and you won`t have to ship it to another country to get service.  Leason learned from another popular rod company(on this site for some reason) sure we`ll replace your rod pay for 40 bucks for shipping x 2 plus a 25 dollar service fee....blah blah in then end it was cheaper and easier to throw the piece of crap in the trash!  I will never buy another rod that is not made by Shimano!!!"
793180,Ainsley,2013-06-17 23:39:00,142,"I'd suggest jumping on a sale for a dobyns champion 733 or 734. I throw 5"" senkos on my dobyns champion extreme 743 and it feels perfect. The 7"" might be above the sweet spot on a 3 power rod."
793206,Lape0019,2013-06-18 00:50:00,647,"I would suggest the Dobyns Savvy 733 as well. The rod is quite nice and is pretty sensitive for that price of rod. If you can find a used one, a champion 733 or a dx744 would be amazing but you may have an issue finding one of those in your budget.  As for warranty, if the store carries the rod and you break it, hand over the 60 or so bucks and they hand you a new one no questions asked. I slammed a tip in the rod locker, told the owner of the store what I did and his exact words were, ""You wouldn't be getting a new rod out of shimano..."" If you believe it broke because of manufacturing defects, it works a little different but I don't think just because of their customer service, I continue to buy these.  Adam"
793208,Acountdeleted,2013-06-18 01:00:00,2562,I am a big fan if the Mojo bass rod I bought off of my cousin. (He sold it because he was nervous using something that expensive). I can't get over how sensitive it is.
793221,Believer,2013-06-18 01:31:00,40,A little bit cheaper but I'm really happy with my Abu vendetta
793228,croixed,2013-06-18 01:59:00,14,I suggest you go to a local tackle shop and pick the one that feels right to you.  Its a great way to get a feel too of how different blanks are from one manufacturer to another.
793230,jedimaster,2013-06-18 02:00:00,3472,"I thought he said limited to 150?  The crucials are on sale at fishing world for about 120. If I was getting a crucial for a weightless worm rod it would be a 7'2"" M XF. will also make a good drop shot rod. the MH Fast is also a good option for a worm rod if you fish weeds. If you are going into the 170-220 range I would take a look at the G.Loomis GL2 series. I have a GL2 Drop shot rod and I love it."
793314,BucktownAngler,2013-06-18 15:52:00,582,"do they sell dobyns at bps or sail? ive never seen one before...would like to get a feel for one  my last rod was a 7ft MH and felt a bit to light for the 7""s"
793332,lookinforwalleye,2013-06-18 17:45:00,4399,"not a lot of dealers around according to the web site there is one dealer in the GTA, Pro J tackle in Toronto."
793337,wkimwes,2013-06-18 18:11:00,76,"Fishing World in Hamilton carries Dobyns.  To be honest I wouldn't buy a Savvy series for jig and worms.  I find the Shimano Crucial more sensitive, which is on sale at Fishing World, which btw you could get a price match at BPS.  Show them the online ad from Fishing World or if you frequent a local tackle shop and have a good relation, I'm sure they will match it.  At that price, it's an even better prive.  In my opinion if you want to buy a bottom contact rod from Dobyns you need to at least go Champion.  The Savvy just seems dead in my hands.  Another rod to look at would be a Fenwick Elite Tech Smallmouth (although it isn't a 7' it's 6'9"") or take a look at the Fenwick Aetos, you can buy them at Sail 99.99 and 149.99).  They fish better than the price, not going to say they are GLXs or Champion Extreme, but both rods are built well and balances well with a lot of reels.  In my opinion the Elite Tech fishes equally to rods in the 199 range and the Aetos in the 200-300 range.  Oh just realized you are using it for Senkos, since it is a slack line presentation, you should be fine with the Savvy."
793348,BucktownAngler,2013-06-18 19:29:00,582,"does anybody have the link to the crucial sale at fishing world? i checked the site, but i dont see it at that price.  Thanks"
793349,salmon,2013-06-18 19:36:00,334,"IMO I would look for a used Shimano Cumara 7ft - 2 in I have one and use it for weightless wacky, incredible rod if you can find used. Light, super strong and casts exceptional.  IMO the new Crucials are not what they used to be according to guys on tackle tour."
793353,wkimwes,2013-06-18 19:54:00,76,"Looks like they aren't on sale anymore, they just were yesterday.  That sucks!  Sorry man."
793354,wkimwes,2013-06-18 19:55:00,76,"OH I did get an email from Sail though,  "
793365,JoshS,2013-06-18 22:07:00,729,"I bought a new crucial last year, feels weird... there are better rods out there. I'd give Bills Bait and tackle a call and see what they have if you're in the area. They'll order in anything and I'm sure they'll give you a great price."

793379,fishindevil,2013-06-19 00:14:00,6254,Go with a loomis GL2 I have 2 of them and about a dozen crucials for the money they are awesome !!! And shimano owns G Loomis now anyways !!!!
