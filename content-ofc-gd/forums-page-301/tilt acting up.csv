792996,workwear,2013-06-17 02:43:00,592,hey guys......was out on balsam yesterday.....while flippin in shallow water....i raise my motor.....10 min later i turn round and its dropped back to the down position......tilt wouldnt hold its position.............motor worked fine with the tilt....just wouldnt stay locked....  can anyone give any insight on this??........im thinking low fluid levels   thanks
792997,DRIFTER_016,2013-06-17 02:45:00,10439,You probably have a leaking seal. Most likely the one that seals the shaft of the tilt ram.
792998,workwear,2013-06-17 02:46:00,592,i guess its off to the mechanics...???or is it a n easy fix??

793003,fish_fishburn,2013-06-17 03:03:00,1311,Theres a screw with a flat tip on the pump thats used to raise the motor when the trim fails. Make sure its tight if its not it can be leaking down from the loose screw.
793009,SlowPoke,2013-06-17 03:37:00,2984,"This would be my bet. Just to clarify ""can be leaking down""; there won't necessarily be an external fluid leak there, a loose screw on the manual relief valve will allow fluid to ""leak"" past the valve.  If there's no sign of fluid loss in the T/T system, try tightening the manual relief valve as fishburn advised. These valves don't have a high failure rate but if it is defective, it shouldn't set you back too much."

793138,workwear,2013-06-17 20:21:00,592,thanks guys....ill try that first.....spoke to my mechanic...didnt like what he had to say.....
793412,workwear,2013-06-19 01:58:00,592,thank guys for all the info........i drained all the fluid and added new oil...cycled it a dozen times....problem solved.....for now anyways.....if she starts acting up then its prolly a seal....again thanks to all those that responded  btw priced out a new tilt and trim for my motor.....ouch!!!....1800.00 new
