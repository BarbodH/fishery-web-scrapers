792983,ccmtcanada,2013-06-17 01:48:00,7971,That's awesome!!!!  Amazing catch!  Now dad...I think he has proven he deserves a nice 6 foot spinning setup!

Ccmt, he already has a few spinning outfits, but he always asks to bring that lil spin cast lol. I should also mention he picked the bait, a simple Texas rigged worm with no weight, with 50km/h winds blowing right into our faces lol. The water was so stirred up i doubted we'd catch anything. Guess he proved me wrong!!!!"
