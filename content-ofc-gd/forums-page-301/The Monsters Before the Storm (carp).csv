793002,Rich,2013-06-17 03:01:00,3927,"What an evening. Nothing interesting to tell in technique. We set up on our favourite run on a Lake Erie trib for the afternoon/evening to try for the big girls. Regular canned corn on a three way swivel rig did the trick. Though we were losing fish left and right, which made it feel like a terrible evening... When we looked at the pics, we realized : today was epic!            Great evening on the water with a longtime friend."
793007,Freshtrax,2013-06-17 03:30:00,2215,Dam those fish are big and ugly
793008,ccmtcanada,2013-06-17 03:32:00,7971,Wow!  Those are huge!  Great going guys!
793012,hotsky,2013-06-17 04:11:00,400,Nice carp! did you use a hair rig or corn on the hook??
793022,Rich,2013-06-17 10:44:00,3927,"Thanks guys..  Corn on the hook. I've never liked hair rigs at all.  Last day out carpin there, I couldn't keep them off corn on a jighead. Yesterday it had to be a three way swivel setup to get the hook in them and keep it there."
793024,asdve23rveavwa,2013-06-17 10:50:00,2690,Some nice brutes there Rich. One of these days I'll have to target them.
793031,wildeye rainbow,2013-06-17 11:53:00,123,Nice ones!  I've been targetting them on my local erie tribs with a cornmeal mix.  Lots of fun on light tackle.  WR
