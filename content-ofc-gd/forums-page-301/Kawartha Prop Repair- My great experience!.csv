Looking for a prop that would provide more bow lift than my factory 17P Yamaha prop on my 18' Lund Alaskan w/ 75hp yamaha tiller  John @ Kawartha Prop Repair spent probably at least 2 hours trying a few different props with me. We found a good Stainless Steel 4 blade 15P that seemed to give me good speed and lift with little vibration. I was getting 35 mph @ 6150 rpm.. We figured that once I had my normal load in the boat It would drop to right at 6000 rpm.  2 aspects of this prop I did not like after running the prop on the may long weekend was we burned at least 1/4 tank more in fuel with less weight and below 800 rpm it sounded like the gears in the lower unit were not fully engaging until I hit the gas a bit.  I called John back and talked to him. He offered to let me try a few more different 3 blade props instead and also agreed to wait till my new Truck comes in so I don't have tow with the wife's little SUV again.. WHICH IS AWESOME!  These guys are the only shop that I could find that would even let me test a prop, let alone swap for another one if I wasn't happy.  He's even gonna balance and add a little cup to my factory prop for me for a small fee..  Kawartha Prop Repair is 2 hours from me, but I was so impressed with John's level of service. They will be my prop dealer from now on!!  Thank you John for the great service!"
