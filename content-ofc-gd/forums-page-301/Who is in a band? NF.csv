Anyway I  thought I recall there being a few people in bands here. Message me if you know someone or are in one thanks."
793357,ccmtcanada,2013-06-18 20:08:00,7971,"Message headhunter.  His band ""Road Gravy"" is awesome!  http://www.roadgravyband.ca/"
793360,jedimaster,2013-06-18 20:45:00,3472,"Thanks, message sent.  Whats wrong? I hear you have some magic fingers on the 6 string not up for a solo gig?"
793366,ccmtcanada,2013-06-18 22:13:00,7971,Lol.  One person on guitar and a voice a band does not make!!  I've seen Road Gravy live and they would be perfect I think!
793373,Big Cliff,2013-06-18 22:50:00,6899,I'm part Iriquois does that count?  Actually though I have had the pleasure of listening to ccmt play and it is beautiful. If he vouches for a band I would have no problem hiring them!
793465,Headhunter,2013-06-19 12:50:00,5703,"Thanks for the recommendation Cliff! Unfortunately Road Gravy will be on hiatus until October with some bad summer holiday planning having each of us off somewhere, until October! HH"
