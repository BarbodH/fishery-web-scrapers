792865,Bob,2013-06-16 20:18:00,370,"Maybe grass pickerel? Oops, didn't read all the posts first. We used to catch lots of them east of Toronto many years ago and called them grass pike. There are a couple of pickerel species residing in southern Ontario and most folks don't even realise it."
792901,Roy,2013-06-16 22:53:00,13728, Which 'pickerel' species are they?
792903,danc,2013-06-16 23:07:00,4677,I think he's talking about Chain Pickeral Roy. I'm not sure but I don't think there's any around Southern Ontario.
792907,Roy,2013-06-16 23:15:00,13728,"You're right, Dan. They're all up the north east US and in Quebec...might be some in Ontario but it's out of their range. They don't even come as far west as I am...I have to travel 100 miles or so east and south east to get them. It'd be interesting to know if anyone is finding some in Ontario."
792923,aplumma,2013-06-17 00:04:00,6896,We have chain pickerel in Virginia in selected water basins. It is about the furthest South I have heard of them being without special help from man or spring fed.   Art
792925,danc,2013-06-17 00:20:00,4677,So it's official. There's no Pickeral in Ontario. I knew this 100 years ago. Ok. Maybe 40 years ago.
793026,Rich,2013-06-17 11:18:00,3927,There is chain pickerel in Lake Erie.  AND there was recently an article about how Lake Erie's grass pickerel numbers are dropping on the north shore.  North shore.. thats us.
793286,Bob,2013-06-18 11:20:00,370,"Never heard of chain pickerel being caught in Ontario, just grass and redfin."
793290,Roy,2013-06-18 11:56:00,13728," Neither have I, Bob. As for grass ( sub species of redfin) and redfin, there are supposed to be a few, very few on the southern shores of lakes Michigan, Erie and Ontario however, due to their small size ( one pound maximum) I suspect that most fisherfolks would mistake them for juvenile pike."
793296,BillM,2013-06-18 12:21:00,17367,I think we can all assume that fish is an Atlantic.
793304,ehg,2013-06-18 13:35:00,2666,"I remember back about 6-7 yrs. ago a member (PatrickGG) posted a report where he caught a chain pickerel in lagoon at Leslie Spit (Lake O). It weighed about 8 lbs. It was the weirdest catch since they are not supposed to be here and it was fairly large.. No doubt it was chain pickerel , maybe crossed with pike. Wish i could find the picture or post here."
793316,Toad Hunter,2013-06-18 16:03:00,261,so wait - you mean walleye are NOT pickerel ?  - J/K.
791663,pics,2013-06-10 14:51:00,1268,The color of the water could be the reason the fish is so light...I bet if you put it in clearer water it would turn much darker... Looks like a Grand River or Binbrook fish...
791696,jbailey,2013-06-10 17:13:00,866,could it be a grass pickerel? don't they look rather similar?
791697,jbailey,2013-06-10 17:17:00,866,http://www.rom.on.ca/ontario/risk.php?doc_type=fact&lang=en&id=309
791698,Cloudy15,2013-06-10 17:20:00,141,"What if I bring my tank to the lake, then place it in the water put my fish in and then put cover on?"
791732,lookinforwalleye,2013-06-10 19:09:00,4399,Really???
791736,solopaddler,2013-06-10 19:25:00,8605," Funny story.  Long, long ago I once worked for Canadian Sportfishing. Hank and Italo were doing a bass fishing seminar at the CNE and needed live bass for the huge swimming pool set up in the coliseum. I was given a company truck and several huge coolers and was told to catch as many bass as I could (at one of my personal favourite bass ponds I might add) and rush them to Toronto. Being young and dumb I agreed.  Anyhow I caught probably 30 small bass and took off like a bat out of hell for the CNE. Italo had given me his radar detector and I was told to use it LOL!  I wheeled into the parking lot like an indy driver and backed the truck through the doors of the building, dumping the still lively bass into the pool.  Mission accomplished.  Next morning we all drove over early to set up and guess what? Every single one of those bass had jumped out of the pool and lay dead or dying in the aisles.  Those guys pushed the limits of right and wrong a lot back then. I was very fortunate I wasn't caught and charged with something myself. Still can't believe I did that, but when your boss tells you to do something and you're young and trying to get ahead, well......  I can laugh about it now."
791891,hotsky,2013-06-11 04:13:00,400,"That might be it, no? size 30cm looks about right and marking looks pretty close to the pic in that link."
791892,BillM,2013-06-11 04:22:00,17367,It's a juvenile pike.
791893,hotsky,2013-06-11 04:24:00,400,"Alright, if it's not raining I'll go back tomorrow and see if I can catch a larger one"
791894,Toad Hunter,2013-06-11 05:08:00,261, pffttt..I find it hard to believe those guys would partake in such unethical practices
791907,solopaddler,2013-06-11 09:13:00,8605," I know it's shocking isn't it.  I believe there's good in everyone, I truly do, and there's a lot of good in both of those guys. Besides which it's never a good idea to throw stones when you live in a glass house. No one's perfect myself included.  People learn, grow, evolve, and yes, change. (one can hope)"
792128,beagle dad,2013-06-11 23:55:00,224,seem a lot here are sure ..but I be counting the hole bottom jaw to be sure have seen lots of colour variations of musky  and this looks possibly barred or banded musky
792129,Rizzo,2013-06-11 23:56:00,4754,"Back in the 90's a buddy and I went to a Halloween party as Hank and Italo. Although the ladies in attendance had no idea who we were, I did snag myself a date that night"
792130,beagle dad,2013-06-11 23:58:00,224,sorry by holes I mean pores.....5 or less pike  6-9 musky
792131,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2013-06-12 00:14:00,535,"Was her name Barb, by any chance?"
792157,Cudz,2013-06-12 02:02:00,2652,Yipes.  Hope not.
792167,John Bacon,2013-06-12 02:44:00,3277, The bars on a muskie are darker than the back ground colour.  Pike on the other had have light markings on a dark back ground.  The fish in the picture has light markings on a dark back ground which would rule out muskie and tiger muskie.  Juvenile pike often have bars instead of spots.  I am still going with pike.
792185,Toad Hunter,2013-06-12 06:25:00,261," you know, I never even thought to ask Once I heard it was tact to my limit I canned the whole idea and now just have tackle shop minnows in there- with nothing to eat them"
792226,ehg,2013-06-12 14:13:00,2666,"  That is a great story!  They  were generous back then. I remember entering the Canadian Sportfishing contest in mid 90's and winning tons of stuff which i still mostly have. Even won Canadian Pike angler of year from going to Toronto harbourfront with boat. lol. Caught dozens of 34-40"" pike with CN tower in view. Remember Marc Travers.?  Oh yeah that is a 100% juvenille pike in initial picture here. lol"
792747,hotsky,2013-06-16 02:23:00,400,Got another little bigger pike there. cant really see the patters too well but it's also very light. btw I got it on a shrimp while fishing for bullheads.  
792759,northernpike56,2013-06-16 04:04:00,717,"it is a pike for sure. I seem to catch a lot of them around here that are the exact same size, color and pattern. They love mepps blk fury #2 and #3"
792762,Rich,2013-06-16 04:06:00,3927,Now that is enlightening. People keep telling me to try my catfish baits for pike and I never do. Maybe it's time to try again!
792763,Rich,2013-06-16 04:08:00,3927,May I ask was your bait on bottom or below a float?
792774,hotsky,2013-06-16 04:34:00,400,I used a float but the bait was on the bottom or inches away from it.
792775,Rich,2013-06-16 04:41:00,3927,Thanks I'll have to give it a shot at my pike spots!
791304,hotsky,2013-06-08 21:49:00,400,Got this today at a place 15 minutes from home (Hamilton). I was positive it was a baby pike but the pattern looks off...like a tiger or a musky.  Is it possible??   If I had an aquarium that bad boy would be coming home with me....  
791306,mike rousseau,2013-06-08 21:55:00,4661,Looks like a pike to me
791309,ehg,2013-06-08 22:07:00,2666,Ya pike. Pretty sure it is illegal to keep native species in an aquarium.  Probably wouldn't live long anyways.
791310,hotsky,2013-06-08 22:09:00,400,Never seen a pike that light or with vertical stripes :/
791311,kickingfrog,2013-06-08 22:19:00,8333,Pike all day.
791318,Moosebunk,2013-06-08 22:38:00,3970,Pike to me.  And if it came from that dirty water that'd be the reason it's light.  They get lighter too... Big Lake Ab silvers and the odd purple.
791322,hotsky,2013-06-08 22:46:00,400,"Thanks guys, that's my personal best  ."
791325,Locnar,2013-06-08 23:06:00,645,Rounded tail fin and colouring says pike. Striping says muskie. I'm gonna go with pike.
791326,John Bacon,2013-06-08 23:21:00,3277,I would say pike because it has light coloured markings on a dark back ground.  Both pure muskies and tiger muskies have dark coloured markings on a light back ground.  Pike have light markings on a dark background.
791335,kickingfrog,2013-06-08 23:50:00,8333,Juvenile fish do not always show the same markings as adults. Some salmonids are particularly difficult sometimes.
791336,Rizzo,2013-06-08 23:55:00,4754,...what he said. That's a pike.
791338,danc,2013-06-08 23:57:00,4677,It's a Pike. I can tell by the smell of it.
791351,Rich,2013-06-09 01:11:00,3927,"Definitely a juvenile pike, no question. A musky in that water would be white."
791365,Pigeontroller,2013-06-09 02:22:00,2793,Sub-manible poor count is the only sure way to tell with a fish that age.
791368,Rich Nelson,2013-06-09 02:37:00,332,Where did you get the nice Musky in your Avatar?
791379,hotsky,2013-06-09 03:53:00,400,"Georgan Bay,"
791385,DRIFTER_016,2013-06-09 04:30:00,10439, Better let BassPro know.
791426,ehg,2013-06-09 16:46:00,2666,"HaHa, I was gonig to phone cops but apparently BPS are licensed, lol"
791429,Rich Nelson,2013-06-09 17:16:00,332,Beauty fish. How big? Did you get her from shore?
791464,Rich,2013-06-09 20:41:00,3927,Actually the only illegal part is the live transportation from waterbody to aquarium. Haha
791476,ehg,2013-06-09 20:56:00,2666,That's true. I remember a  thread 5-6 yrs. ago about this and it was summarized by posts like 'who cares'. lol  Have caught 15 to 20 inch musky and the are silvery with dark markings.
791590,Toad Hunter,2013-06-10 05:56:00,261," this is true, you need a permit to transport it - AND it counts towards you possession limit (no joke- I looked into a couple bass for my back pond but decided against it after I found the last bit out )"
791591,mike rousseau,2013-06-10 06:01:00,4661,What if your fish grow beyond the slot and they're in you pond (possession) ???  Lol
791595,Stoty,2013-06-10 07:02:00,2910,"Def a Pike, but a cute little bugger!"
791630,msp,2013-06-10 12:43:00,1336,Atlantic !
