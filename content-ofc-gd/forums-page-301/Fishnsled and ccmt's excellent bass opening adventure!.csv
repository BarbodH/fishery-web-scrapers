792800,ccmtcanada,2013-06-16 13:17:00,7971,"Will and I had reserved yesterday to fish....thing is we had no idea whether or not to fish the bass opener or hitting Lake Ontario for some trolling.  With the weather shaping up the way it was, both looked very promising!  Seeing as we pretty much ignored bass last year, we decided to hit a Kawartha Lake and it turned out to be a great day!  The day started out a little bit cool, but soon we were fishing in shorts and t-shirts.  It's been such a cool and wet spring it felt great to simply enjoy summer weather fishing again!  On Will's second cast of the day, he hooks into a great largie!  He brings it close the boat and then it tail danced a little and got off!  He ""says"" it was at least a five pounder...but hey, without a picture we'll never know...LOL.  He did however, boat the first bass of the day...   We fished any and all structure we could find...but I wasn't having a lot of luck for the first hour, so I switched up to my confidence bait...a simple senko and it was the right decision!  I landed my PB largie...pulled it away from a stump in about 4 feet of water.   The numbers weren't crazy, but we consistently pulled out bass...most in the 1 to 2 pound range.  Bass fishing for me is usually a tedious exercise with only a few fish caught, so it was great to see some pretty steady action!  At one point we had a double header on.  Just as Will sets his hook and begins to bring it in, I get a nice hit as well! My fish is on the left...and as you can see is much bigger than his! LOL   Ok...so maybe I told him to do an arm extension a little on mine...here's his fish by itself....lol   In the early afternoon, the heat of the sun was increasing, but the bass bite was decreasing, so we decided to see what else was maybe biting.  I put on a big suick and began working that in about 10 feet of water.  Soon after I get a hit!  Guess what species of fish it was?? Yep...bass...LOL   I then put on my go-to spinner hoping to hook into a small muskie.  So of course I caught this....   The bass kept on biting too!   Finally, just as we were getting ready to leave, my trusty spinner lands me one of these...   Couldn't have asked for a better day out on the water.  Always a great time, rain or shine with you Will!  Thanks for a great bass opener!!  So, where are we fishing next?? LOL "
792803,Terry,2013-06-16 13:23:00,14456,looks like going for bass was the right choice ..looks like fun
792811,Roy,2013-06-16 14:47:00,13728,"Some nice fish there too, guys! Congrats on your opener."
792819,The Urban Fisherman,2013-06-16 15:13:00,2050,Awesome fish boys!!!! Thanks for the report!  Ryan
792820,danc,2013-06-16 15:14:00,4677,Beauty guys!!
792885,misfish,2013-06-16 21:28:00,29133,"You guys are rocking man. Great report Cliff. I can see a tag team match,. Misfish and Terry VS ccmt and Fishnsled.."
792897,spincast,2013-06-16 22:22:00,3279,that looks like a great day. Looking forward to some multi species days starting soon
792931,Moosebunk,2013-06-17 00:30:00,3970,"Will... ya kinda got schooled by the Hobbit this time.  I mean, ya got some nice bass but Cliff kinda went ape on the overall species count.  Fun times guys!"
792936,asdve23rveavwa,2013-06-17 00:41:00,2690,Great multi species day.
792944,fishnsled,2013-06-17 00:51:00,3520," After fishing the Kawarthas for over 25 years and my knowledge of these waters, it's like I'm guiding him. So do they really count as his fish??  Cliff certainly had a long over do great bass and multi-species day and I salute you!  We both did very well but I could only get the bass to look at my baits.  Going to go and clear out the local tackle stores of the hot bait that Cliff was using and hope he loses the one he had and can't replace it.      Thanks for doing up the report Cliff and we'll do it again soon!  Shall it be more bassin' or some shiny silver fish from the big water?"
792948,Moosebunk,2013-06-17 00:57:00,3970, I know you know brutha!
792949,The Urban Fisherman,2013-06-17 00:58:00,2050,I guess those big in-land browns and that real nice bow you caught last spring doesn't count either then eh buddy!?!? lol  Once again great report guys!!!

792953,fishnsled,2013-06-17 01:05:00,3520,"  It was a guided trip that I paid for and to which the funds went to a great cause.  So ya, technically not my fish but I really didn't care.  They sure were a treat on the BBQ."
792965,ccmtcanada,2013-06-17 01:22:00,7971,What kind of a guide makes his client navigate the boat using the trolling motor while he sits on his butt and eats lunch!?!??  I'm not implying anything....just sayin! Lol
792970,Moosebunk,2013-06-17 01:27:00,3970,Foreman... guide... same thing really Cliff. lol.   Man's gotta eat though.
792994,ccmtcanada,2013-06-17 02:37:00,7971,That sounds like fun!  We should do that sometime!  Right after you teach me how to use that center pin! (Which I haven't even out for steelhead in almost 2 years!)
792995,ccmtcanada,2013-06-17 02:38:00,7971,Whatever! Lol. I picked the lake that day so I think that disqualifies him for being a guide. Lol
793090,alphaalpha,2013-06-17 17:08:00,475,"looks like you had a great day.  I was out with a buddy but we couldn't get into much decent fish.  just two smallies throughout the day weighing 1.5 and 2lbs.  Tons of rock bass tho, they seemed to be EVERYWHERE!"
793101,fishnsled,2013-06-17 17:34:00,3520,"LOL!!  You're actually 2 for 2 when picking the lakes this year.  Might have to change your name to Carnac The Magnificent!!    We found lots of rockbass (aka W.G.S.F.), some big ones too, perch and bluegills as well.   It was a great day on the water with good numbers, decent size and variety."
793125,mattyk,2013-06-17 19:09:00,2110,Looks like a nice outing!
