Anyone know any good SM/Walleye Provincial Parks in Quebec that they would recommend?  Ive never been fishing in Quebec and really have no idea where to start.  Any help is much appreciated!  "
793318,chris.brock,2013-06-18 16:24:00,4053," check out La VÃ©rendrye, I've been there paddling and there's plenty semi- remote, drive to sites too, I don't think there's too many smallies though, more walleye and pike"

793427,can u fish,2013-06-19 03:10:00,326,I am also recomending La Verandrye good walleye fishing and pike i have fished the park for many years from a very young age as we had a cottage in Maniwaki and would make several trips to the park  in the spring and fall here are a few lakes that i would consider trying the Cabonga Reservoir wich  has easy access right off the main road into the park now if you want to go off the beaten path i would recomend willderness camping on Lac Nicolet this would also give you access to Lac Nichcotet the Grand the Dusty and Nine mile if you would like more info you can send me a pm good luck.  Cheers Mitch....
