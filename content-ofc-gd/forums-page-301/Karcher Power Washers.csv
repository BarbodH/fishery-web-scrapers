793376,captpierre,2013-06-18 23:52:00,2521,Costco has a Karcher Power Washer with a 190 Honda motor on sale $80 off for $319.  Is this a good machine?  Can't see any plastic on the pump.  Al metal/brass.  Thought I might pick one up.  Is there much to winterizing these things?

I would purchase this unit again and recommend. Puts electrics to shame. I bring mine indoors, but i would imagine you would need to winterize if you kept it where the temps dip below zero."
