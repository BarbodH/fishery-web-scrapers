Didn't need the toy, just a rope for him to play tug-of-war with his uncle. Enough fish to keep him happy and after 5 hours on the water the grown-ups were the ones who were ready to head home.           And at a busy lunch time launch there was only one bozo.  "
792691,misfish,2013-06-15 20:18:00,29133,Rob  Bozo? No never happens.LOL
792702,danc,2013-06-15 21:40:00,4677,Awesome Rob. I will have to get my grandson out soon as well. He looks to be the same age as your little guy.
792706,Roy,2013-06-15 22:29:00,13728,"Excellent report and pics, Rob. Things that make a family stronger......"
792715,kickingfrog,2013-06-15 23:10:00,8333,"All things considered on a beautiful June Saturday, one is almost tolerableâ€¦ But he was a beaut.  He's almost 4 and a half and if you post a photo of your grandson with a brookie bigger then anything I've even seen I'll quit.  The hope is he likes it now, and loves it when he's 15. I'll start working on his sister in a couple of years."
