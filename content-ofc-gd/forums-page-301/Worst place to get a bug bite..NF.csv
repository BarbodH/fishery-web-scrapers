792179,RDR,2013-06-12 05:35:00,125,Blackfly bites on the eyelids are the worst for me.  ADRIAN!!! ADRIAN!!!! CUT ME!!! LMAO
792184,Toad Hunter,2013-06-12 06:21:00,261," Thats almost more torturous than a knuckle bite.   x2 arch of the foot is pretty bad too, I have ""high arches"" so have a hell of a time trying to rub it on the bottom of the shoe"
792394,bigbuck,2013-06-13 12:35:00,2449,"Ankles. Nasty spots to get bit. During black fly season, I spray my whole body down with Muskol before I get dressed. Other than the lil buggers flying around my face, I find I dont get bit by them thankfully. For bad skeeters, I still have some paint thinner Muskol thats 95% deet from the 80's that I break out."

792440,Old Ironmaker,2013-06-13 17:11:00,8243,"That spot in the middle of the back you can't get to. There used to be a product called Calmitol that worked wonders and can't get it anymore. Shoppers sells something called Afterbite. I don't leave home without it. One in the car, truck, boat, golfbag and tackle box. As soon as you feel a bite or see one put a bit on, no more itch. As long as it's not in the middle of your back where you can't reach."
792466,Believer,2013-06-13 20:32:00,40,Ditto on the horseflies on your feet. Had one in between my toes.

792594,wkimwes,2013-06-14 20:35:00,76,"Knuckles, and ankles.  Somehow the mosquitos love to attack my ankles, just last week I had a row of 4 of them together, it made one big swollen heap.  Plus when I work out it gets irritated from the rubbing of the sock and shoe during my runs.  I had to stop it was so bad!"
792688,Toad Hunter,2013-06-15 19:04:00,261,"I remember about 4 years ago, I was at a cottage for a buddies batchelor weekend on Kamamiskeg (Berrys Bay) - after a LONG night of ""festivities"" and after everyone crashed, I canoed out to the swim raft and was casting away with no luck. Eventually the fun had caught up to me and I fell asleep on the raft, using my travel tackle bag as a pillow. Woke up after about an hour or so with the sun pounding away on my pounding head.. made my way back to shore only to have the ones who were waking up point out my neck and back were COVERED in bites, from everything from misquitos, flies and dock spiders I would imagine... made the hang over extra pleasant. I DID how ever eventually catch the biggest fish of my life that weekend a low 40's Northern -and of course I couldn't get a picture- but my brother and his friend witnessed it and were both blown away by the beast (maybe even more than I was) so it made it all worth it. Somewhere in that lake is a monster with some interesting piercings (as it took off with my mepps giant killer after shreading my 50lb braid (no leader  )"
792719,Dabluz,2013-06-15 23:26:00,701,"I spent most of my life hunting and fishing and nevertheless....I'm allergic to blackfly bites and mosquito bites.   I really swell up after getting bit.  Yes....the area around the eyes is a bad spot.  One bite and my eye swells up closed.  Other than the eyes, I think the worst spot is on the lips.  My mouth goes all lopsided and the itching lasts for at least 24 hours."

792879,Rod Caster,2013-06-16 21:13:00,5784,Went camping last night...everywhere is the worse place when your trying to sleep! Especially when it's those darn no-see-'ems that get through the tent mesh. Can't believe how bad the skitters were last night.
792888,danc,2013-06-16 21:35:00,4677,I'd have to say that the worst place to get a bug bite for me is in Nakina.
792893,aplumma,2013-06-16 22:05:00,6896,Down here it is not the flies or skeeters we have to contend with it is the Gnats that swarm over your head and bite. The bite doesn't do anything after the pinch/pain at the time of the bite but you can get literally 10 per min. at the wrong time.   Art
792895,danc,2013-06-16 22:17:00,4677,"A few years back I had a job in The Pas Manitoba. We stayed at a nice lodge on a beautiful lake. When we attempted to leave our cabin on the morning of our first day of work, we were met by a wall of mosquitoes. Never seen anything close to this in Ontario. We slammed the door shut and had to make a plan. We simply had to run to our truck as fast as we could through the mass of bugs. There were millions of them. When we returned to our cabin after work we were pleased to see thousands of dragon flies cruising in mid air and picking off the misquitoes. It was amazing. After dark the bats took over. Nature. It's an awesome thing."
792935,Moosebunk,2013-06-17 00:41:00,3970,On a fly-in must've been a blackfly that bit me on the pinna.  Sucked cause one guy was the worst snorer ever and that bite would irritate when putting the earplug in.  Scotch and Gravol helped take the irritation away though. lol.
793010,Toad Hunter,2013-06-17 03:41:00,261, Hey I thought I said leaving the genitals out of this..
791895,Toad Hunter,2013-06-11 05:18:00,261,"ok- so (leaving the genitals out of this one) -being the season and all, and being the avid out door enthusiasts we all are, I am sure we have all had em... So I was curious, where would everyone say is the worst place to get a bug bite.. I always seem to be a buffet and this year is off to a ""great"" start. (must be all the expensive beer in my veins). I would have to say the knuckle.. any knuckle. you can never seem to get a ""good scratch""."
791897,fishindevil,2013-06-11 07:04:00,6254,The worst is on your eyelid from a blackfly while you are sleeping in a tent !!!!!!!! The next morning it was like I got hit with a baseball bat !!!!! My eye was swollen shut and a big bruise it was nasty !!!! Took a few days for it to go away !!!!! And the itch was brutal ......
791900,sauce,2013-06-11 08:35:00,219,Eyelid sounds horrible.  Knuckle IS super annoying.  Neck is torture. They always bite close to the collar. Which is constantly scratching the bites making them swell and get painfully itchy.  Can't go shirtless when the bugs are thick.
791910,solopaddler,2013-06-11 09:31:00,8605,"The horseflies always go for my toes when I'm wearing sandals, those bites kill!  My dog got stung by a bee right on her bum a while back. Now all I have to do is make a buzzing noise and she jumps around wildly in a huge panic LOL!"
791919,NAW,2013-06-11 10:39:00,4022,There is one spot on my toe that gets bit at least once or twice a year.  In the exact same spot.  And my entire foot swells up.  Not sure why...
791921,mercman,2013-06-11 10:44:00,7054,"Now that painted a vivid mental pic for me this morning !! Dogs are so silly. My worst spot is behind the knee. Hard to scratch, and the skin is sensitive there and gets all irritated after scratching for days."
791925,muddler,2013-06-11 11:26:00,623,Middle of the back. That little spot where I can't seem to reach no matter how many contortions i do.  muddler
791926,boombap,2013-06-11 11:29:00,310,I would say anywhere on the foot is bad. I have 3 right now on my right foot and it sucks.
791930,woodenboater,2013-06-11 12:20:00,2277,"yup. eye lids, any knuckle and the feet. esp if it's deer flies targeting you"
791939,Locnar,2013-06-11 12:58:00,645,You said no genitals... well... fair enough. The worst is when you're droppin a load and black flies swarm your arse. The chafing... the horrors.
791940,TJQ,2013-06-11 13:02:00,7806,Eyes elbows and feet.. underneath.
791945,mrdylan,2013-06-11 13:15:00,111, Yup I have been hit by mosquitos down there and it's down right nasty.  Every time you sit down!! I also agree about the knuckle though too.
791957,Rod Caster,2013-06-11 13:53:00,5784,The area just above the belt and just below the shirt on my back. easy for the bugs to reach and sub-consious scratching makes it a real bad spot for me.

On a more serious note, my dog got into a ground nest of yellowjackets a couple years ago & got the crap stung out of his face. To this day, his right side jowel droops, & his eye doesn't close all the way. Dam bees..I HATE 'em!"
791965,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2013-06-11 14:28:00,0,right now i can't tell where is worst!  the past 2 weekends i have been absolutely destroyed by bugs while out fishing and i feel like my skin is on fire.
791968,jedimaster,2013-06-11 14:34:00,3472,Knuckle sucks. I got a bee sting on my hip once right where pants are supposed to sit. not a fun week.
791971,bow slayer,2013-06-11 14:45:00,1074,"on the head,for some reason the deer flies like to get tangled in my hair and bite on the head.A close second is the feet,when bit by the large black horse flies my feet swell,any swelling is an allergic reaction"
791982,woodenboater,2013-06-11 15:27:00,2277,"was fishing near the cut on the west ram last year and I swear, every deer fly musta been all over me. the feet were hammered, esp the second toe. unless it's absolutely searing, I'll always wear long sleeves, pants and socks now."

791993,Sinker,2013-06-11 16:13:00,8692,"For me its not so much where, but by what.  Blackfly bites don't itch me too bad for some reason,  skitters itch but go away quick.  A deerfly bite on the toes has to be the worste. Especially once your back to work, and have to wear safety shoes/boots. Pretty hard to scratch those ones!  S."
791998,kickingfrog,2013-06-11 16:32:00,8333,"I kicked a hive once walking in a field, I ran all the while flailing away at myself. My buddy thought I was having a ""episode"". I only ended up with a handful of stings. For a long time after that I would ""hear"" a buzzing every time I walked in high grass fields."
792038,nlpaintballer,2013-06-11 18:56:00,122,"I am one of those lucky people who don't get any reaction, other than bleeding when the blackflies take a chunk. I don't even react to bee and wasp stings anymore.  I was stung a lot as a kid, even stepped on a yellowjackets nest that was in a beaver lodge while fishing and had stings from my sock line to my underwear line because I was wearing shorts. It was 2 weeks before the swelling and itching went away, but that the last time I remember having a reaction to any kind of bite or sting."
792090,aplumma,2013-06-11 20:53:00,6896,Since all of the good places to get bit have been covered. I HATE it when you are drifting off to sleep and there is one stupid mosquito that makes a run at your ear and the buzzing noise gets really loud and then quiet.  Art
