My Hotmail account has been dicey lately, Howard wasn't impressed and actually wouldn't say a word to us when we showed up at 10:30, not 7, after not receiving my Email. The Americans coming out, also didn't acknowledge our presence I'm guessing because Howard told them the reason for their late departure was us. Some tension we don't really want on our vacation.  I can't really blame Howard, he had to make 2 trips and for all he knew my story about the lost Email was Bull, it did feel like being back in high school though  This grouse was like a rooster, sitting on a log behind the cabin, drumming at first light    Howard came in Wednesday to do some work. Hard feelings persisted, all he said to us was- ""Chris, why is the (kitchen) chair in the boat?"" me- ""for my bad back"" Howard- ""if it goes through the boat you're in trouble""  here's a gear picture, one thing interesting is the golf stroke counter, we use them to keep an accurate account of fish caught    There was a new member on the team this year, my nephew Teagan, the first evening he was happy with this 5 lb pike    damn, Monday was a rain day, I whip up a thunderstick and wave it at the sky to blow the clouds away    rain day plinking out the kitchen window    the water was still high and cold, Mike Borger was nice enough to give me a map with detailed spots and GPS coordinates, the fish weren't in summer mode yet and we had to start from scratch, Solo's best spot on the lake only yielded 1 whitie, no walleye at all   we had to work for our fish, they were scattered and hard to figure out, here's a 4.5 lbs walleye, released    tried to head up a creek to another lake that Mike had reached, a big tangled mess stopped us about 1/4 of the way up    more to come, I'm going to post this and edit in more stuff so I don't loose what I have..........  out running the storm  %5Burl=http://s949.photobucket.com/user/chrisbrock17/media/sucker_zps61e5691c.jpg.html%5D%5B/url%5D    some pike between 8 and 11 lbs    %5Burl=http://s949.photobucket.com/user/chrisbrock17/media/100_2333_zps13c9ed8d.jpg.html'>  %5Burl=http://s949.photobucket.com/user/chrisbrock17/media/sucker_zps61e5691c.jpg.html%5D%5B/url%5D  some pike between 8 and 11 lbs  %5Burl=http://s949.photobucket.com/user/chrisbrock17/media/100_2333_zps13c9ed8d.jpg.html'>  Team Deep Bay Group shot    a great trip, biggest walleye, 4.9 lbs, biggest pike, 10.7 lbs, 468 fish in total, well, the sun has set on another trip, I already miss being up there    more stuff added  you've heard of the Hungry Bear, here's the thirsty bear    4.9 lbs walleye    pike around 10 lbs    a triple header    pike on the scale    rapids on the Kowkash  http://i949.photobucket.com/albums/ad333/chrisbrock17/rapids_zps73656d2a.jpg"
792971,Musky or Specks,2013-06-17 01:27:00,2710,When you say Kowkash was in full flood does that mean you boated in from the Bridge?
792973,danc,2013-06-17 01:32:00,4677,Nice. Beautiful Grouse shot!!
792975,Moosebunk,2013-06-17 01:33:00,3970,"So far so good Chris.  MacClays, fishcounter, E-Trex and portable finder in one pic... that may as well have been my boat dood.  Too bad about the tense feeling with the outfitter.  Looking forward to more.  And the great grouse pic should be in a mag somewheres."
792981,chris.brock,2013-06-17 01:46:00,4053," yeah, boated in from the bridge   thanks Moosebunk, the MacClays was my Dads though (I ran out)"
793034,corvette1,2013-06-17 12:04:00,1765,awesome trip chris glad it all worked out
793058,NAW,2013-06-17 14:06:00,4022,"Great report Chris. A little Erie though..  We have the exact same fish finder, beer cozy, GPS, and we drink the same cheap beer!  Brothers from another mother I guess...  I believe we both run Bravo's as well.....  We've got to meet up and go fishing sometime!"
793066,chris.brock,2013-06-17 14:48:00,4053," we'll go fishing together and finish each other's sentences, it'll be easy for me to steal a beer or 2 out of your cooler, ""oops, sorry 'bout that, thought it was mine"""
793097,solopaddler,2013-06-17 17:23:00,8605,"Hey Chris, I'm not ""too"" surprised the main lake shoals weren't hotspots....but the inflow and outflow of the river should have been ridiculous! Sounds like you had fun regardless, although the weirdness from Howard is a bit of a downer. Too bad about that.  Looking forward to some more pic's, Aba will always be one of my favorite lakes.  Cheers"
793119,adempsey,2013-06-17 18:58:00,1498,Nice report!   Thanks for putting it up.

793483,Musky or Specks,2013-06-19 15:23:00,2710,Yep that looks like the Kowkash in full flood alright. Canoed it for 7 days at that color and it made the fishing suck.
793512,Rod Caster,2013-06-19 16:54:00,5784,"Great trip... that's a silly amount of fish, regardless of what you expected!"
793542,chris.brock,2013-06-19 18:31:00,4053, did you paddle down the Little Current too?
