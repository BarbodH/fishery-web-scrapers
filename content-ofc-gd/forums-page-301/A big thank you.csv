792914,Handlebarz,2013-06-16 23:26:00,3790,The 2013 auction to help fight cancer is now over I want to say thank you to all who have donated and bid on these great items.  This year you all raised $1432 that is going to the fish-a-thon for a cure.  Most items are already paid for so that is awesome. I can't wait for the event to get out and see you all again.  Cheers
