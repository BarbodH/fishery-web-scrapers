Because of work related issues I haven't had a whole lot of opportunty to get out for musky in the last 6 years, limited to a few small trips(one or two days). GBay musky require that you spend some time on the water and I just haven't been able to do it and have therefore gone fishless for the last six years.  This weekend was the Mississauga Chapter of Muskies Canada annual get together and my regular partner and I decided to go at the last minute. We were lucky enough that a couple of beds were still available in a cabin so off we went to enjoy the Georgian Bay opener and meet some new fellow musky anglers.  Twenty three anglers enjoyed relatively good success with 7 musky caught. The largest being 48 inches although a former guide not part of the friendly tourney got a 52"". Fish were caught on a variety of baits and the prize table was severly burdened before the draw was held.  The food was excellent and it was great to meet some new anglers.  We got a late start Saturday and didn't hit the water till after 9 am. I put on one of my favourite baits, a custom made 10"" Zoomr in Orange and black. The musky god's were smiling on me and my long draught was finally ended when on my 3rd cast of the day to a shallow rock Smash, throb, shake, weight. A fish. Knew right away it was a musky. There is just something about the way they fight compared to other fish.  Heres what a musky angler looks like after a long drought is finally ended.      It was only 40.5 inches but its awesome to have that monkey off my back.    Once again a big thanks to RiverHaven Resort for hosting a wonderful event and John Milotic and the Mississauga Chapter of MCI for putting it together."
