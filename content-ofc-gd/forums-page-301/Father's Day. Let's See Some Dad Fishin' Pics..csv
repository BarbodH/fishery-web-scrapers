792924,Moosebunk,2013-06-17 00:16:00,3970,"Great Father's Day dinner here at our place today.  Got drenched this morning catching lakers and brought one home for the BBQ.  Cedar planked the fish and smothered it with maple garlic butter scallops and shrimp.  Spent the afternoon looking through Dad's old photos which he scanned and put to Photobucket.  Wondered how I went so long up north only seeing him a couple times a year, yet since moving home in 09 it's been the best thing having him and mom close by.  He never really did teach me to fish at all, but nowadays it certainly is great teaching him a thing or two about it after he's taught so much, much more about life.  Happy Father's Day.     "
792929,Musky or Specks,2013-06-17 00:29:00,2710,That's awesome Bunk. Hope you get out many more times with him and teach the old dog a thing or two.
792933,lew,2013-06-17 00:39:00,12766,Your a lucky man to still have your dad around Drew.  My dad's been gone 16 years now but he was an avid fisherman & here's a favorite picture of him taken on a fishing trip back in the 50's. That old baitcaster he's using is the same reel I learned to cast with.   
792938,Moosebunk,2013-06-17 00:43:00,3970,It's those old pics that are the best keepsakes Lew.  Very cool shot.  That boat looks like it's made out of solid rock... but with wood gunnels.
792941,lew,2013-06-17 00:48:00,12766,"Yeah, that was a great old cedarstrip with a 25 HP Johnson Seahorse. Back in the day that baby was the fastest boat on the lake  Notice the twin gearshift handles for the motor, one for speed and the other for F-N-R and the steering wheel on the left side of the boat and originally, it was in the rear seat."
792945,Moosebunk,2013-06-17 00:54:00,3970,"Think I saw that motor on the Big Rideau this morning.  When the guy fired it up at 6:00am in Portland, the people in Smiths Falls felt tremors and the cloud of smoke wiped out an entire flock of passing geese. lol.  The guy sure did get 'er up on plane and tour outta there though. lol  Again Lew, it's a one of a kind.  Things aren't at all made like they used to be... or some could make them."
792952,danc,2013-06-17 01:05:00,4677,"My Dad. He's had his share of issues in the past few years, but he""s still here. I gave him a big hug today."
792955,The Urban Fisherman,2013-06-17 01:11:00,2050,"Great idea for a thread Bunk - I don't have any old pics of my dad in digital form but one pic that sort of stands out for me is this big old boot he caught at the mouth of hte credit river a couple of years ago.  It was his first time fishing for great lakes salmon and I had been trying to get him down south for years to try it out.  Finally the stars aligned, we only had a few hours in the morning to get out before volunteering for a kids fishing event and sure as crap my dad caught the only fish of the morning.  I wouldn't have had it any othe way!  ( sorry Dan haha )  He caught it on a livetarget smelt and the fish went crazy!!!  "
792957,The Urban Fisherman,2013-06-17 01:11:00,2050, wow that thing is huge! lol
792958,northernpike56,2013-06-17 01:14:00,717,"My dad doesn't fish, He is more of a golfing guy, but he always took me fishing whenever we went to a cottage when I was a little kid to get me interested in it, he's still the coolest guy I know +1 for the thread, great idea"
792963,danc,2013-06-17 01:21:00,4677,Yea I know. I don't know how many times that I've told him to get that belly toned down. He never listens.
792966,Moosebunk,2013-06-17 01:23:00,3970, lol.  Two tanks in that pic.  One for the oil and the other for the gas.
792976,ccmtcanada,2013-06-17 01:35:00,7971,"Here's a picture of my dad in 1961...   Once us kids were born, we'd visit a friends cottage where he taught us how to fish...   He was an outdoorsman at heart...here he is shortly before being diagnosed with cancer.    During a chemo break, he had enough energy to fish...so me and my brothers hired a guide for some Lake Ontario Lakers.  This turned out to be his last fishing outing, as he passed away 6 months later.  Hard to believe he's been gone 18 years now.   Thanks for starting this thread!  Made me smile to dig out these pictures again!"

793020,bigugli,2013-06-17 10:41:00,6138,"I sometimes envy you fellas. I didn't have a dad, but I had uncles who more than made up for it.  I just hope my son has lots of fond memories of me as years go by."
793059,The Urban Fisherman,2013-06-17 14:12:00,2050, Cliff - your old man was STYLIN' back in the day - even while he was fishin!  What the heck happened to you buddy? haha Thanks for the post
793060,The Urban Fisherman,2013-06-17 14:13:00,2050,LOL that's some funny stuff...
793063,ccmtcanada,2013-06-17 14:26:00,7971, What?  you don't like my new fishing shirt??? LOL 
793074,quickme,2013-06-17 15:50:00,261,Great Thread!!!   This father's day was bitter sweet for me.  Lost my dad last year and thought I was okay until Yesterday.  Went to visit him at the cemetery by myself and couldn't keep my emotions contained.   I did wake up to my boys wishing me a happy father's day and the best hug a father could get.  Sorry I couldn't find any fishing pics  http://i1244.photobucket.com/albums/gg571/quickme6/IMG_0671_zps53b75fb1.jpg  this is a pic of him and  I  http://i1244.photobucket.com/albums/gg571/quickme6/IMG_0673_zpsc3a747f7.jpg  A pic of him and his Grandkids on his birthday  http://i1244.photobucket.com/albums/gg571/quickme6/IPhonepics019_zps1cf09e8f.png  Proud dad with his boys on the ice  http://i1244.photobucket.com/albums/gg571/quickme6/IMG_1206_zpsa3460a9c.jpg  Hope everyone's father's day was a good one filled with memories and unforgettable times!   nick
793076,fishsevern,2013-06-17 15:57:00,112,"Like many of us my Dad taught me how to fish and was a few years since we last fished together.  Friday I drove up north and fished with my 7 year old son till noon.  Got back to the trailer for lunch and Mom & Dad arrived so we went out for a couple hours pike fishing.  I gave Dad my magic spoon and he caught a couple small pike.  It was good to fish with him again.  Besides the pike, he saw the biggest loon he had ever seen, the head was just massive, wish I took a picture.  He also never saw the family of 10 hawks on our lake but they made a special appearance that afternoon. Everything seemed to fall into place.  Happy Fathers Day!"
793192,Moosebunk,2013-06-17 23:55:00,3970,"Great pics and stories doods, thanks for sharing them."
793196,solopaddler,2013-06-18 00:25:00,8605,Here's a couple of fairly recent pictures of my dad.    Abamasagi two summers ago    Dusey River last June with my son in the background   And here's one of my uncle who passed away unexpectedly this past January. He had the biggest impact on my life when it comes to fishing and he's missed every single day.  
793240,Tim Mills,2013-06-18 02:32:00,476,Thanks for the thread my Dad died in 1993 and we had some great times together fishing. My Father around 1980. Bronte Creek was my favourite spots to fish with him. Some of you Bronte regulars may recognize the pool.  We had some good talks on the drive home.    My Dad and his buddies- Elliot Lake I think mid 80's.  He went fishing every year or 2 for about 40 yrs with these guys.  I'm surprised the plane could take off with all the booze on board.  My son Reilly and I Saturday on Tremont Island in the 1000 islands.  My buddies family has been have an opening day tournament since 1969.  He won it this year- report to follow.
793244,BillM,2013-06-18 02:36:00,17367,"My oldman with a big snake on the other end of the line.  There isn't anyone else I'd rather have as a fishing partner.    I drag him out everywhere, lol!    "
793246,Cudz,2013-06-18 02:45:00,2652,Hey Bill.  Do you only ask your dad to go fishing when it is raining?  LOL!  Nice pics
