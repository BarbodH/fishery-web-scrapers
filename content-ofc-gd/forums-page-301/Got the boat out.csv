792696,Terry,2013-06-15 20:39:00,14456,"well had to do some fishing So loaded up the boat and headed for the Kawarthas must be bass opener, 7am the  the ramp is packed the parking is full and the road with the no parking sign.   Full I squeezed in and off I went. I got one on and thought it was a fat little pike but when I went to remove the hooks in the water I saw it was a muskie,  I grabbed the camera but as things go ,it finished getting off before I could snap the photo.  I did a lot of   rip jigging but not a bite  tried a worm harness with a plastic worm and that was the ticket  I got 5 of them , nothing big but it was great to get out  sorry pictures aren't much but here they are           the folding boat does ok, but I will be happy when thry deliver the new boat  new date is june 22     "
