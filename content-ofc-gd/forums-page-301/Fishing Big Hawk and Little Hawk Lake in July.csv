Also, any recommended lures or bait that has worked for you. My friend has never fished.Any info on the lakes would be appreciated. Thank you."
792542,Sinker,2013-06-14 11:58:00,8692,I'm pretty sure there's bass and lakers in both lakes.  Tons of back lakes in the area too.  S.
792543,big guy,2013-06-14 12:07:00,414,"Yep, smallies and lakers and still the odd brookie around, my buddy caught a dandy several springs ago up in the fast water below the Nunikani dam. Nunikani Lake above Big Hawk for bass and lakers and a few smaller lakes off of it for brookies if you have a canoe.Good trolling lake, trolling the shorelines will produce bass, you will have to get deeper for the trout, but vertical jigging will work if you can slow your drift."
792682,og09,2013-06-15 16:52:00,2,"Thanks for the info guys.They have a canoe there so the back lakes will be fun. Any other info on which back lakes are good, as well as which lures were successful for you?Also, any pike or walleye around in that area?"
792794,big guy,2013-06-16 11:57:00,414,"Kashagawigamog Lake has walleye and muskie, Kushog has pike. It`s connected to St. Nora Lake, so I imagine they are in there also."
