793200,captpierre,2013-06-18 00:47:00,2521,My Lund dash trim gauge has stopped moving.  Stuck in down position.  Motor is a Yammy 115 4stroke 2007.  Is there an easy fix for this?  Can live without it but would be good to have it working again  Thanks for any info out there  peter
793220,NANUK,2013-06-18 01:31:00,797,"Check the trim sender cam bracket on your motor, They are prone to crack and a known problem with Yamaha, The good news is that Yamaha has corrected the problem a few years ago, the new ones are made out of stainless and cost less than $15 at your local dealer, The cam bracket is located on the steering tube in front of the motor, it looks like a black plastic hose clamp, visually it might appear to be OK but if you can move it by hand, it is broken, There is an inside and an outside tab on that cam/clamp, make note of its location, The inside tab goes in a little dimple on the steering tube and the outside tab is supposed to go under the sender unit's little arm, The sender unit is directly in front of that cam and looks like a little switch with 2 wires and a little spring loaded arm ( # 3 on the diagram below ) install a new cam/clamp same position as the old one.  This diagram shows the newer ss cam and screw ( # 1 and # 2 ) http://www.boats.net/parts/search/Yamaha/Outboard/2006%20and%20Later%204-stroke/F115TLR/BRACKET%202/parts.html# if your motor already have this ss cam, the problem might be with the sending unit or the trim gauge.    ."
