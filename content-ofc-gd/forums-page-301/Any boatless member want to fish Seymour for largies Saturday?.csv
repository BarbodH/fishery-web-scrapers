792439,hirk,2013-06-13 17:10:00,571,"it will be up to him if he wants to post pics etc.. old ironmaker i offered it to someone young becuase i thought it might make a great memory for them and they likely dont have the same opportunities as older guys, i wanted someone who truely would be pumped to go.For what its worth one of his parents are going with him."
792441,Old Ironmaker,2013-06-13 17:15:00,8243,Like I said I don't want to ruffle any feathers. I'm glad a parent is going along.

792435,Old Ironmaker,2013-06-13 16:54:00,8243,Why offer this opportunity to a young person only? I don't want to ruffle any feathers here but it would be a cold day in hell before I let my 15 year old go off with someone I don't know from Adam.
