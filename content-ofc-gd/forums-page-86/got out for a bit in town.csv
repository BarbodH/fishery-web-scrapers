Yesterday was better for numbers but today was better for the biggest fish.  All and all here are the numbers.  Yesterday 10x crappie landed, 1x blue gill and 2x rockbass.  Today was 8x crappie, 1x RB and 1x BIG pumpkin seed.  I think I'm finally starting to figure out crappie with soft plastics and I've never really targeted these fun little buggers.  Most fish were all palm size and well, I'd never keep any that size.  May try again Thurs is time and weather works in my favour..."

Did take one pic but it's still on my cell and not on the pc to share.  I don't use the mobile site and my luck the pic's to big a file
