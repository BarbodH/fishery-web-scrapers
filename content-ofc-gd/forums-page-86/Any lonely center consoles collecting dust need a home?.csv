I originally covered it in vinyl and it looked ok but a few years later its torn up and needs replacing. I bought a 1/8"" sheet of white plastic and been gluing and capping it and its starting to look good but started thinking maybe someone has a used one sitting in a backyard or shed/barn.  I don't need a huge whaler console but would pefer something like that.  The one problem I may have is that my steering hoses are pretty stiff and un-movable so some consoles just won't match up.  Just pm details (price/size) etc. and I'll get right back.  Thx."

Give me a size and I'll give you a price. With or without plexiglas wind screen.  Change those cables, now. You are going to be on the water and suddenly you can't steer, ask me how I know."
