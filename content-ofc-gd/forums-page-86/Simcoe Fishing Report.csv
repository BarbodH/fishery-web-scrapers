Caught 4 Smallies    biggest was 4.5 lbs    Also got my personal best 13"" perch, hit a big spinner bait thought I had a bass lol.    For size comparison:    Also bumped in to Misfish on the water and had a nice chitchat about his 5 lakes in 5 days trip report.  Awesome guy.  Cheers"

LOL  Was nice to meet you as well Mr. Governator. For the life of me, I cant figure out you young fellas.  ( did I just say, young fellas ) Hell, Im young too, at heart anyways. LOL. A nice easy paddle canoe and you got an electric motor to push ya around. LOL  Nice stringer of perch and yes, that area holds some nice bass. Keep it to yourself. If you do, they will be there  years to come to play with again. I did notice your choice of spinner bait. There are many spots on the bay to explore, and access with a toon or canoe. Pm when you need a shore launch area.  See ya on the water again soon  Tight lines"

Those 13"" Perch can put up a fight and fool the best. When I see green I think ""Oh my a nice eater Pik."" Then when I see she's a Perch, winner, winner Perch dinner."
