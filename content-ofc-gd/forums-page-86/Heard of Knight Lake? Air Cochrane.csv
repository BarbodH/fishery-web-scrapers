I have been on Mikwam, Haultain, Nettogami, and Edgar lakes with Air Cochrane.  Seem strange that there seems to be no information on this lake.  If you or a friend know anything about this lake I would very much appreciate any insight and/or reflections.  Many thanks in advance~Bret"

Otherwise, they just reopened that camp under Air Cochrane last year.  So, won't be much information around under them.  I believe it's a shallow very weedy lake.  Take a look at the bing.com aerial map of the lake.  https://binged.it/2vbZ7JG"
