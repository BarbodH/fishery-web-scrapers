1009743,Canuck,2017-07-24 01:30:00,491,"I am a novice mushroomer and I found these while walking the dog in a hardwood forest.  Growing on the soil, not on stumps or deadwood.  I am 90% sure they are chantarelles, but not 100% and I don't want to be sick.  Are any of you experienced enough to tell from photos?    "
1009748,KraTToR,2017-07-24 02:17:00,506,They look like it to me but id have to smell one to be sure.
1009749,Canuck,2017-07-24 03:00:00,491,They definitely smell sweet.  Maybe like apricots like they say. But not sure. Do false chanterelles smell sweet?
1009785,Sinker,2017-07-24 17:14:00,8692,They look like it to me too. I use this website a lot for mushroom I.D and info.  http://northernbushcraft.com/index.htm
1009789,manjo39,2017-07-24 17:44:00,354,No one has ever died from not eating a mushroom.

1009824,Canuck,2017-07-24 23:18:00,491,True. But not helpful. Maybe life saving though.
1009825,moxie,2017-07-24 23:24:00,1566,Ahh Cmon!!!! Cook em up and give em a try.
1009826,Canuck,2017-07-24 23:24:00,491,I read probably 50 web sites now and watched videos of foragers showing where they grow and what they look like. And how to tell them from false ones. I am getting close to 100% sure. I even bought some dried ones at Longos to compare the smell and look.  Nothing I have read or seen makes me think they are not.   I think I will fry up a couple and see. The false ones are supposedly bitter so should know pretty quickly.
1009827,moxie,2017-07-24 23:29:00,1566,Now that i think about it a buddy gave me a handful of shrooms a while back. They are from the Mushroomis Magicallis variety and will light you up for 8-10 hrs but since its been years since the last time i dared to eat a batch theyll stay wrapped up in my tool box.

Reminds me of this for some reason: 
1009843,Canuck,2017-07-25 04:13:00,491,"Ahh Cmon!!!! Cook em up and give em a try.  Well, I am either stupid or brave or smart to have done the research, but....  I reread again, and looked on line about false chantarelles and characteristics. Softer flesh, have actual gills, not an apricot fruity smell, and looked at more pictures. Getting pretty confident so.....  I cleaned and fried up about 1/2 cup with butter.  They smelled really good.  Not just mushroomy, but better.  Hard to describe, but really nice smelling.  I also rehydated a few of the dried ones from Longo's, then quickly fried them to see how they smelled compared to the fresh.  Pretty darn close.  Based on reading, if they are the false chantarelles, I may have hallucinations, and may get pretty sick, but won't die.  I am 100% sure they are not the jack o lanterns that are kind of close looking, but are actually poisonous.  So, here goes nothing.  Heated em back up and try one.  Holly crap, is this ever delicious.  Down the rest.  Fried up a couple more and had them too.  Try to get my wife to try some.  Nope - she tells me that she knew it would end like this.  Says tomorrow night if you are still around will try them (she could smell them frying).  Off to play hockey.  That should test my stomach.  Well, the verdict is in.... CHANTARELLES!  And looks like there will be a lot where I found them.  A pretty wide area and not too far walk from home to get them.  Cool.  Or I will die in my sleep and this will be my last forum post."
1009849,moxie,2017-07-25 14:09:00,1566,Hehehe. Just kidding buti do remember my mom putting a silver coin in the pan with the mushrooms and if it tarnished they werent edible and if it didnt tarnish ther were. Or was it the other way around?  Oh well.
