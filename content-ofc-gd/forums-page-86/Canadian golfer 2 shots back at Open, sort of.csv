Sort of. He was born, raised and lives in Irving Texas complete with his southern drawl. His father was born in T.O. and Austin has spent all of his summers with his Grand Parents outside of Halifax N.S since birth. He's as Canadian as I am American because my mother was born there. To read about Austin, who has been hitting balls since the age of 18 months the link is below. He has played as an American as well as Canadian. He's just a little guy that hits a straight ball. To say he's Canadian is a stretch I think.  http://www.sportsnet.ca/golf/person-interest-canadian-austin-connelly-set-make-open-debut/"

1009708,Old Ironmaker,2017-07-23 16:21:00,8243,"I don't have to walk sitting here. I'm a mess, plus got skunked Friday fishing. How does one throw a shoulder out fishing??"
1009711,dave524,2017-07-23 17:01:00,4508,"Yeah, growing up golf was always an upper crust, snobby gentleman's sport at a fancy private country club with strict dress codes, most blue collar workers preferred bowling and a few brews , colourful silk looking bowling shirts and bowling shoes with a matching ball bag. Somewhere around 1970 golf started to gain support among the working class and courses proliferated in former farmers fields,  I , for the life of me, don't see why,"
1009716,manitoubass2,2017-07-23 18:19:00,11391,"As an angler and Skateboarder, I really love golf.  You can't master it.  It has most of the elements of fishing too  And Canadians usually root for Canadians, so I get that  My personal favorite though is Jordan spieth. Not only is he a great golfer, but he's young, rarely drinks(youde be amazed how many pro golfers are drunks/alcoholics), and he tips his caddies very well"
1009718,manitoubass2,2017-07-23 18:47:00,11391,Aaaand just seen the news he won the British open.  Good on the kid. Wish I woulda watched  Sounds like he put on quite the she show in the final round
