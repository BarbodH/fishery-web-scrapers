1009324,PBenson,2017-07-18 01:37:00,154,Got out last week on the kayak and had fun with some smaller bass on the topwater frog at sunset. Hoping to get out for some bigger ones this week. Check out the footage of the blowups!  
1009331,GBW,2017-07-18 02:15:00,8460,cool vid.  thanks for posting.  have you ever thought of making a power pole type device to keep you stable?  I only ask as that was the 1st thought that ran through my mind on the 1st fish.  Never fished from a 'yak' before is why I ask.

I don't do this type of fishing a ton but it would definitely be super helpful.

1009371,GaryJ,2017-07-18 17:27:00,12,Thanks for the vid....going to go buy me some of them frogs for topwater'ing.
1009379,PBenson,2017-07-18 17:53:00,154,Definitely recommend it!
1009393,misfish,2017-07-18 20:27:00,29133,Enjoyed the vid. I have the same issue with my session 5. I think maybe the sound is hampered if I dont have the cube set properly in the holder. Can you elaberate on the mic thing you are talking about please.  Thanks for posting

Can you elaberate on the mic thing you are talking about please.  Thanks for posting  I have an external mic that I use which makes the sound quality much better than the regular GoPro mic. It also has a wind muff that cancels wind noise. I think it got water on it because it started only recording in one speaker, so I went and bought a new one. This only applies though if you don't plan on getting the GoPro wet. If you do, the GoPro mic is really your only option."

1009469,PBenson,2017-07-20 01:29:00,154,"Thanks, completely agree. Something about the explosions is so addicting. I can't wait to get back out there for more on the yak."
