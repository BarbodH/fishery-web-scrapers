They cancelled all of His insurance immediately, Home and Auto and what a hassle to get insurance from another company. My thoughts are an airtight from Kijiji. Good Luck Mike"
845236,mcdougy,2014-04-02 23:38:00,274,"Insurance company is after our group. We have/had a homebuilt woodstove/oven in our 1000sqft camp for the last 20 years. ""They"" are requiring something with a CSA/ULC tag on it, to continue ins. coverage.  I was wondering what stove you folks would reccomend, and or the type/brand to stay away from?  We use it as the only heat source, Keeping a pot of water warm, and the oven on the current stove is the only place we use to cook roasts and such.  We are hoping to keep the cost under $1000.  Have looked at some of the ""cookstoves"" but I am concerned in their capability to heat the camp? And wether you have to feed them wood REALLY often due to the small firebox?  There is a propane cook top in camp, but are trying to stay away from going to a propane oven as this camp is in the middle of no-where with no services. All propane is hand carried in on ATV's and boats and I was concerned a p. oven would use a fair bit of propane in the 1 and 2 week stays we have. (moose and deer)  Let me know what you have or would try?  sidenote: Annual insurance premium keeps slightly rising as they keep putting the replacement value of the camp lower....Bull!!!  Cheers MM"

845511,mcdougy,2014-04-04 04:45:00,274, Do you use the oven much?  We probably cook with the current oven 3-4 nites in the week.  But I have no experience. I guess it wouldn't use much more than a BBQ.

My 960 square feet is risk assessed to cost over 300k to replace if it burns down and it ain't no palace.

Get someone to take the WETT course... ""inspect and certify"" and shove that paperwork up their     .

845647,67ZL1,2014-04-04 23:48:00,51,I would go with a Pacific Energy or a Blaze King Princess model. Might cost more than a grand to find a used one but you'll be money ahead after using it for a season.

You might also ask your cook(s) to do more on the stove top and less in the oven (and I have been a camp cook at MANY camps!!!)  Another option, and this is not off the wall, we actually did this, is to move the cook stove outside and use the oven outside only.

845681,crappieperchhunter,2014-04-05 02:02:00,2582,I grew up with my folks having a very small cottage on the upper bruce. Had a wood stove but the cooking lighting and heating was all taken care of by propane unless you really wanted to run the woodstove. Even had a propane fridge which worked great but we didn't use it much...pretty much in the summer only. We went up there 12 months of the year. Dad had 2 100LB propane tanks and they lasted forever especially if you  used the woodstove for heat  as well.

Yes, we realize that WETT may be needed and thats not to big of a concern, as Fire SAFETY is a primary concern for all of us.  Irish, When you're talking money like that, yes, insure it.  But, don't be worried about keeping the price under $1,000.00...do it right  Your reminding me of an insurance agent I may know/ have known. You can do it right in that budget IMO with a used stove, were not gaining value/performance from purchasing a brand new one. Also Irish is correct in saying that although it is no palace it is insured for a replacement value of 178k.  2 years ago they had it at 190k. Were not too worried about the structure,it can be rebuilt. Its the liability aspect that is wanted/needed.

Doug  You sound like my inner self. All of these thingshave been talked about and are being considered. Our coverage is good until feb 2015. But their wanting pics of the existing setup and ulc tags. We could play games but are going to buck up and meet their needs. I grew up with my folks having a very small cottage on the upper bruce. Had a wood stove but the cooking lighting and heating was all taken care of by propane unless you really wanted to run the woodstove.

My suggestion would be convert to propane heating and lighting and cooking and keep the  woodheat for nostalgia or flip it the bird.  Everything for propane is already in place and plumbed safely. As well as wired for generator hook up. The place is in the middle of the woods and it seems kinda silly not to utilize the wood for heat especially. I am there for approx. 28 days a year, so cutting that small amount of wood is kind of fun and not much work on a sunday.    Thanks all for your ideas and experiences with different makes/situations.  Keep them coming. Matt"

I know what your saying and have a tough time writing the cheques without cursing a little under my breath.    In this case as well,     but at the same time, since the fact it is a homemade stove wont go away forever,  the way I am looking at it is : This will be safer hopefully and up to ""code""    I could yell scream and get ticked off, but thats not going to get me too far in this situation unfortuneatly/fortuneately. and I don't want anyones butt burnt from a fire."
