I've got 2 Plano liquid bait boxes and they are great. I use one box with new good minnow baits and the other one is my leeches and chewed up minnows and whatever I wanna soak for flavor.  I've got a new retail pack for a trip in a few weeks and I want to move it in to my Plano boxes. Do you guys keep the old juice? Or should I move the juice over to old bait box and keep one box fresh (this is what Im thinking)? Change them both out?  I always figured it all stinks but I'm curious what others are doing with the permanent liquid baits."

1009831,buick14,2017-07-25 01:36:00,741,"I have found when you mix non gulp plastics with gulp in the sauce, everything gets ruined over time.  Gulp baits become stiffer, and other baits deteriorate, change colour etc etc .  Otherwise, that brine lasts a long time so long as it isn't tainted by other non gulp baits.  And, make sure your gulps are always submerged, ie the brine should pretty much be to the top of your container !!!"
1009880,Joeytier,2017-07-25 20:21:00,3990,"If you have some leftover brine from a tub, top up any Gulp bags you might have to make sure everythings nice and moist.  They tend to dry out in the bag and become unusable after a season or two."
1009887,EC1,2017-07-25 22:19:00,930,"If you let the full juice air dry over time, it turns slightly more viscous and dark. Just enough to apply onto a bait like a jelly. Because of the water base, it doesn't stay on very well but I've watched aquarium fish eat it up like I poured down fish food. Do I use it? Almost never, but it stays in my tackle box...  I'd top up the gulp bags every so often because those bags dry over time whether you like it or not"
1009905,mattp33,2017-07-26 04:07:00,290,I just cleaned my garage out after a few years and all I can say is get rid of the old juice.  When it starts to leak it's BAD!!!  I find it swells most plastics I use and try to soak in it.   (Yamos)
