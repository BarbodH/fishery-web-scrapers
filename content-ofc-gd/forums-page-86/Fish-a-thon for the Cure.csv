It was my uncle that took me and my cousin fishing for the first time when I was around 7, he taught us to embellish that day too!! I will never forget that day, or him.  The website still shows last years, August 20th 2016. If anyone knows it would be HTHM, Albert. Come in please Albert, come in, over."
