1009008,tb4me,2017-07-15 05:58:00,3295,I have a Jonserd chainsaw. 16 inch bar. anyway ts time for new fuel lines...I remove the covers and primer then the carb. now its time to install new lines..lol ya  right. The big line in the back went in real nicely..Now the small one in the front. What a nightmare..I have the line cut on a nice 45 and the tube lubed up with some wd-40 and it wont go thru. Is there a trick? There has  gotta be.. Any advice would be awesome.. I'm almost at the point of hiring someone soon lol ... I wonder if there is some sort of tool that I can buy or borrow..
1009012,Big Cliff,2017-07-15 10:08:00,6899,"We use a piece of fine wire,  Feed the wire through the passage where you want the fuel line to go and out the fuel cap hole.  Puncture a hole in the fuel line right in the 45Â° cut you made in the fuel line (we just use the wire itself to do that) (push the wire about 1/2 an inch through the hole then bend the wire back on itself and wrap it around the main wire. Spray a bit of  WD 40 on the fuel line then gently pull the fuel line through using the wire.  If you still can't get it, plan a road trip to Lindsay, I'll do it for you no problem, no charge!"

1009037,Big Cliff,2017-07-15 14:33:00,6899,"I just did mine two weeks ago,It is a Mac 3818,just fed some mechanics wire all the way through the new line and bent back,cut on a 45,went through easy,good luck !!! Glad that worked for you, the wire we use is about the diameter of the wire you'd find on those tie wraps (but we use a piece about 8-10"" long) flexible enough to pull through but stiff enough to feed down into the gas tank and fish out through the gas cap."
1009041,tb4me,2017-07-15 16:18:00,3295,Brilliant! Thanks guys...worked like a charm..Ha to thing I spent 4 hours lastnight messing around with this thing..Did it in under 45 seconds...LMAO. Cliff Ill be in Campbellford in 3 weeks on Vacation..Not to far from you my man...
1009044,Big Cliff,2017-07-15 17:04:00,6899,"There is a trick you'll never forget, glad it worked out for you!"
1009045,grimsbylander,2017-07-15 17:06:00,3016,Slick! Don't you love learning one of those tricks that makes the impossible suddenly simple!
1009049,manitoubass2,2017-07-15 18:19:00,11391,Epic!
1009059,Old Ironmaker,2017-07-15 21:57:00,8243,  A big reason I am here. I even am polite here so I don't get banned.
1009065,Rizzo,2017-07-15 22:48:00,4754,wish I knew that. I once paid a guy $90 to replace the fuel lines...then sold my chainsaw for $100....good times
1009085,woodenboater,2017-07-16 01:30:00,2277,curious. how old is J'red and did the fuel lines go because of ethanol ? I try to run premium gas (Stabiled) in my Husqvarna but also have cans of TruFuel around if I'm feeling lazy  I'll also need to sharpie this wire trick onto the saw case lol

I try to run premium gas (Stabiled) in my Husqvarna but also have cans of TruFuel around if I'm feeling lazy  I'll also need to make sharpie this wire trick onto the saw case lol It was atleast 10 years old..Im sure it was ethanol but you cant complain about 10 years...
