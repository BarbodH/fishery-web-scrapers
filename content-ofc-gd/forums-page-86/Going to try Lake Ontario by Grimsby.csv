1009191,lovetofish,2017-07-17 03:23:00,500,"Hey guys, haven't been out on Lake Ontario in years. A buddy of mine was telling me that it has been great this year, so I figured we would give it a try. I think we're going to start out of Grimsby. Any helpful pointers would've greatly appreciated.  Thanks,  LTF"
1009194,Old Ironmaker,2017-07-17 04:53:00,8243,"LTF. I hear they are still getting fish close in off Port Dalhousie using Leadcore and planner boards with all the usual tackle. My brother got 3 nice Coho with the tried and true orange J-9 Rappala and a blue/chrome Little Cleo a few weeks ago. His buddy landed a good size laker on a Greasy Chicken spoon. Plenty of guys still fishing the pier there. Not Grimsby but close. They fished the edge of the mud line that was out a ways. No doubt with all the rain then, and still now I would presume."
1009201,lovetofish,2017-07-17 10:57:00,500,"So... if I don't have lead core and plainer boards, probably should look at a different plan?"
1009204,Old Ironmaker,2017-07-17 12:10:00,8243,Off course not. Do you have downriggers? Or Dipsy Divers or Jet Divers. I still use snap weights here on Erie. Just get down to the fish. They were about 40 feet deep he thinks. He was 1st mate.
1009213,KraTToR,2017-07-17 14:13:00,506,Check the south shore fishing reports on Spoonpullers.
1009220,lovetofish,2017-07-17 15:06:00,500,"I have a dipsy, but no reels with line counters. I do have an old rod with steel line, lol. no down riggers"
1009221,lovetofish,2017-07-17 15:07:00,500,"I also checked spoon pullers, 45-60' down"
1009223,Freshtrax,2017-07-17 15:35:00,2215,You can count pulls of line in a pinch when sending out dipsies. Each pull is about 2 ft . But to get down 50 ft you will need about 200 ft of line out.  Not fun on mono trying to trip a to dipsy with that much line out.  You have braided steel or single strand?
1009224,lovetofish,2017-07-17 15:42:00,500,Single strand
1009225,Old Ironmaker,2017-07-17 15:42:00,8243,It's not going to be easy to get down that deep without the right stuff. Go Bass fishing.
1009239,lovetofish,2017-07-17 17:05:00,500,Thanks for your help guys! Think I'm going to eventually invest in a couple of rods and reels with line counters so I can run dipsys. For tomorrow I think I will go to the Grand/ Lake Erie
1009253,porkpie,2017-07-17 18:22:00,2521,"Can do plenty damage with dipseys, but a line counter makes life way easier."
1009254,lovetofish,2017-07-17 18:31:00,500,"Next question. What is an affordable, good combo for this type of fishing?"
1009256,Freshtrax,2017-07-17 18:45:00,2215,Convector30 reel TDR rod.. 50 lb braided line or multitsrand steel.  Dont buy crap at ctc. It will explode on the first decent fish.
1009262,lovetofish,2017-07-17 19:14:00,500,It's funny you say that! I work at Canadian tire and was looking at the combos... lol But that's also why I asked
1009268,grimsbylander,2017-07-17 19:30:00,3016,Is vertical jigging for lakers a good alternative to deep trolling?
1009327,porkpie,2017-07-18 01:47:00,2521,"I'm pretty sure it would work well.  I never tried it because I've got riggers and they eat easy enough that way, but yah off Jordan I'm pretty sure you could get on top of them and do some damage!  Jigging sure works on Simcoe so why not!"
1009410,Freshtrax,2017-07-19 05:31:00,2215,On that note I've always wanted to try and get a salmon on slip float and live minnow.
1009414,AKRISONER,2017-07-19 13:07:00,5558,if you are trying to just punch some lakers without all of the gadgets id cruise around mark fish and drop a swammer on their friggin head just like ice fishing.
1009688,Rizzo,2017-07-22 19:01:00,4754,On that note I've always wanted to try and get a salmon on slip float and live minnow. Bingo! I would love to catch a fish 50 feet down under slip float...the thought has crossed my mind more than once
