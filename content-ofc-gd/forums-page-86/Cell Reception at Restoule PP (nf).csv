My girlfriends mom is in the hospital. We want to be able to get away to the campsite we booked for next week but we want to be able to keep in touching with her parents if they need us for anything.  I haven't been to Restoule in about 3 years and I legit can't remember if there is any reception. We are right on the lake in the south end near the dog park. Does anyone know if we will have service?  Thanks.

Closer to the lake the better.....if u have a waterfront site u will be good....u should have no problem at the dog beach area.
