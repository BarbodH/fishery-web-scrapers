1008704,Old Ironmaker,2017-07-11 20:13:00,8243,"The businessman that does exactly what you want to do is challenged immensely. With the property being somewhat remote he has to have someone on site in the long offseason for security as well as peruse the cabins to ensure they aren't destroyed by varmints. His office is a 2 hour or so drive away in Rochester NY. The main problem is finding someone responsible to do it. He has gone through more than a few ""caretaker/managers"" in the years he has had it. It seems when someone feels they are carrying the ball 24/7 and an absentee owner is reaping the rewards, whether real or imagined, people have a tendency to slack off or skim from the top.  It is a daunting task and I wish you the best of luck. But I do not agree it can be done part time and be successful as well. A quick Google search shows many of these places are for sale across Canada. Many have sold and people bulldoze and build McMansions on the former camps."

I have learned that 80% of all small businesses in Ontario don't make it through year 2, 80% of those don't make it to 4 years. The biggest problem I see today with small business in Ontario is that the rules are the same if it's a Mom and Pop operation or an international conglomerate that owns it, from a Health and Safety Committee and WHIMIS training for a receptionist to use Windex to paying 17 bucks an hour soon for someone serving a bottomless cup of coffee, that's a lot of Joe to cover an hours wages in a small resort.  How many pages was your business plan? It should be no more than 2. Operational plan and SOP's maybe is several chapters. People get the 2 confused."

The absolute top asset of any lodge is its reputation, which will include a strong percentage of repeat clients year after year.  Starting out without the reputation, and obviously without clients, let alone repeat clients, would be a very tough slog.  If a person really wants to get into this business, they should buy out an existing lodge.  Figure out WHERE you want to live, see who the top lodges are, and buy one of them.

There is a big difference catering to dedicated fisherman and hunters versus the MD that goes on a fishing trip once a year or the young family that wants a reasonably priced cottage vacation.  I highly recommend going to a few trade shows (e.g., the two big ones in Michigan) and talking to all the various lodge owners.  Even better, go work as a manager or other staff at one for a summer.  Getting and retaining staff is a huge struggle for many lodges in Ontario so I am sure you could find something."

1008533,Big Cliff,2017-07-10 07:43:00,6899,"Well first off welcome to the board and I like your handle, I was owned by a GSP for many years.  To answer your questions as best I can:  I have only been on one fly-in but guided for several years back in my younger days (a long time ago)  On my trip I chose house keeping because I wanted the freedom to eat what I wanted when I wanted, the idea of having to be back at a lodge for supper right in the middle of a good bite didn't appeal to me.  I chose fly-in because I wanted something remote for my son and I, no cell phones, no internet, and no one else around to bother us.  We had 14' aluminum boats with 9.9 pull start and padded swivel seats (two per boat) which was quite adequate for the lake we were fishing, It was a smaller lake, we didn't have long runs from our camp to get fishing, and we didn't have to worry about rough water. A cedar strip boat requires maintenance, an aluminum not so much.  Guides; I think are important especially if you are fishing big water or in something like the French River system where there are numerous hazards. In our case some very basic knowledge and a good map was all that was required.  Repeat or move around; well I have only ever done one fly-in and I won't be going back there but there are a few reasons for that. In the past though when i have gone on holidays and found a place I really like I tend to go back to where I'm comfortable rather than explore and take a chance.  Hope this helps, good luck!"

So its pretty standard 2- As for how you get there, what kind of operation do YOU want to run and your geographical location will support what you can do. Open all year for snowmobiles, just fly in fishing/hunting, or a nice little place for motorcycle/car tourists to spend a night in the summer?? 3- Id stick with the small boats, some guys have leases and deals with the local marina on boats and motors, trading in regular 4- Thats up to your clientele, Id have someone available to call if a guides required (who knows his stuff), sometimes I've run into older people who just want someone to drive the boat and do the labour not so much be a fishing pro. 5- Id say that 60%+ are repeat customers, and they book next years vacation before they leave.  Go on a couple trips and get some ideas.  Ive seen a resort run that was supported by people on driving tours and sightseeing, they would stay maybe 2 nights and move on. There was a big lodge and a restaurant, some small cabins. A couple boats- fishing was not the attraction. They were also closed in the winter.  Ive worked for drive in/boat in/ and fly in only operations. Some the only thing that was good was the fishing! lol Others run a great operation with everything in tip top shape and killer fishing and hunting.  IMO don't spread yourself too thin- Pick one thing and do it better than your competition. If you have 6lb walleye or 50"" pike advertise the hell out of it and thats what you do. If your cabins have a sauna and hot tub with a masseuse advertise that! If you have 400lb bears you better have 50 bait sights, etc"

So for me housekeeping cabin/cottage is what I look for; when searching for a new place.  #2 I've been to drive in, boat in and fly ins . It depends on what our needs and wants are when we're planing a trip. The place we've been going to for the past 5 years; is a drive to with-in an hours distance of a hospital. My brother has been fighting cancer and we need to plan for an emergency. The last fly-in we were on, he was in remission and got the green light from the doctor; we've not been so lucky the past few years. He's not able to go on the trip this year; but he's still fighting!  #3 16 foot aluminum boat with electric start, 20-25 hp 4 stroke, bilge pump, nav lights, basic graph, trolling motor, pivoting cushion seats and a floor. That IMO is the ideal small lake/river fishing machine and is the description of the rental boat we use at the lodge, we go to.  #4 Only ever hired a guide once; that was a few days into our trip to a new to us lake and we where not having much luck finding fish. Guess what; he took us to all the same spots where we had already been and still no real fish to be had. All we got from the guide was ""you guys should have been here last week"". LOL  #5 If we find a place with decent fishing, the accommodations and equipment are OK and the lodge owners treat you decent; we stay put and re-book for the next year's trip. We usually will make the decision to look elsewhere, if one of the requirements fail two years in a row.  Dan. "
1008605,Old Ironmaker,2017-07-10 21:18:00,8243,"I would say if you won the lottery go for it and hire a huge staff of young workers. Running a lodge is a lot like being a criminal, you don't start late in life and you won't learn it in school. Also like roofers, it's a young mans gig. It would be my last choice for a business really, especially as a retiree. I have seen many times an individual would like to make his or her hobby a business. It doesn't work out often. But you didn't ask for that advise, sorry.  Now having giving you my why not's I do like you are making a plan. In any business you can not be all things to all customers. Some can't boil water and for some half the fun is putting on great spreads and showing off your culinary skills, that would be us when younger. Now I want to be comfortable, big screen sat TV, AC, the works. A nice big boat, no 14'ers these days. 1 day on the water in a tinny and I'm done like dinner. Now if some of us old pharts plan a trip we are bringing along a few 20 somethings all full of phis and vinegar. It all depends on who you see as your clientele. Well off middle to older age sports fishermen or young working guys, and gals willing to ruff it a tad. It is difficult to cater to both in my experience."
1008608,Lord Letto,2017-07-10 22:11:00,70,"I've Only Gone With Family & Never Organized the Trip, But Here's My Experience & Thoughts:  1: The Places we went to, We Had to get our own Grocerys & Cook our Meals, No Roomservice or Restaurant, If I Were to have a Lodge, I'd Likely have a Small Restaurant as part of it if people decide not to cook, but if people wanted to Cook their own meals in their Cabins, they could.  2: Both Places were Drive in for my Family, For us that's the Best option, but if Drive in Wasn't a Option, then I'd say boat in, Maybe offer a Pick up Service or maybe have the Boat the Person/Group would be Renting available at a nearby Marina they can Drive to so They can Load it up & go to the Lodge, Unless they Own a Boat so they won't need to rent one, Just Launch & Go.  3: Both Places had 14 & 16' Aluminum Boats, 1 place had the Option of 9.9HP & 20HP Engines (Had to Pay Extra if you wanted the 20HP), the other only had 15HP Engines, All Had Electric Start & the 1 place with 2 engine options only had bench seats & nothing Really Extra on the Boat, the place with 15HP Only had like 4 Plastic Unpadded Folding Swivel Seats Mounted to the Benches & there was a Electric Bilge Pump on the Boat. Those are OK I Think but if Bigger Boats With more Options were Available for a Extra Cost, Then I Think that would be a Good Idea Also, Have some options for People to Chose From Based on their Budget.  4: Never Used a Guide & I Don't think there was a Option at the Lodge/Camp to get one, at least not Mentioned on the Site, But if it's a Option for a Fair Price, Some People may like that, More so if it's a Area they're nor Familiar with.  5: If we had a Good Experience We'd Likely go Back For Sure, Providing we have good Contact with them to Rebook the Following Year, If We Don't get any Reply back from them when the time comes then we'll likely try elsewhere."
1008612,aplumma,2017-07-10 22:56:00,6896,"I think your best bet to get the answers is to visit a few lodges as a customer and talk to the owners during the week. You actually need to see how much effort or man power it takes to make the part the customers see and make them feel good . One lodge had a dock mate who made sure that the boats were dry, fueled and baited before the customers woke up. It was a real nice touch and the owners were told how great it was. The truth was it was the dock mate who decided to set those standards and the rest of the place was in the dumper. Another lodge hosted a fish fry and a local band one night a week. There door was never closed and they will do anything you need kind of a family atmosphere. They work hard and have a great repeat business. The time they are not helping customers they are improving the camp both during and after the season. The amount of work they do is amazing only because they want to be there with a different group of friends arriving each week. It does not matter that the fishery is not as great as it was in the past and if he has time he will take the time to fish with different people at no charge in his muske boat and if it is to busy he will always circle a few places on his map for you to try. Now this camp they bought was defunked and had a bad reputation but their love of the life and the people made it a success. I guess I am saying make sure you are the right person for the job and make sure you understand what the job truly is. A lodge owner that can not truly make me feel like I am his friend and he wants me there for more than money will fail. I have been to many lodges and that is the difference between returning or look elsewhere for a lodge.  Art"

1008677,John,2017-07-11 16:13:00,2956,"Hi Birddogman and welcome. A lot of us on this site have had experience at different lodges, camps and remote outpost cabins. My initial thought is think about the amount of work both in season and off season and multiply it by 3 or 4 and then you might have an idea of what is involved. The off season work is often longer hours and more involved than in season. Docks, cabins, boats all need maintenance and that's assuming you buy a turnkey operation that needs little work to begin with. As Art says we have seen a lot. From operators that do little or nothing in maintenance and slowly lose business until the light goes on and they realize that they no longer have a viable operation, to those that spend countless hours 12 months a year improving and marketing their operation. Repeat clientele...is really up to you. Again, we have seen operations that were failing badly be taken over and within 2-3 years have large repeat business with clients booking for the next year when they check out. AP appeals to a smaller percentage of the population and the work involved to provide it is large, unless you are a masochistic chef...  .  I love cedar strip boats, the way they handle etc, BUT they involve a large amount of work to maintain. Most lodges and camps are changing over to 16' aluminums.  Don't want to sound negative in any way. This was a dream of mine many years ago but my head had to rule my heart at the time. You will need to dedicate yourself to it 24/7 to make it work, unless of course you are independently wealthy and are just looking for a hobby.  Good luck in whatever you decide."

Really nothing restrictive, but a lil over a million is not that much to rebuild/maintain a lodge as well as costs of operating  True, but with no mortgage you could whip the place into shape the first year and probably break even. With a quick calculation of occupancy needed to cover operating costs.........well ya know but now it's hindsight and ancient it's ancient history.."

Most lodges are manned year round to not only do all of the work you did not catch up on during the season making sure the customers are happy and tended too but to keep the damage down done by weather and people in the off season. You will rarely find a second in command that can take your place in the off season. I own and run a Plumbing company and I could not see trying to pay attention to both businesses because when one business becomes extra time intensive the other business will suffer. Can you at a moments notice leave your primary business to spend a few unplanned weeks because your camp staff quit? When your septic field fails can you line up a contractor from home and feel the job will be completed correctly? Now really complicate this by buying a remote camp where everything has to be flown in. Costs go way up and finding someone to run the operations correctly will be a tough job in itself. Now that he is there and he does a poor job before you catch it you are out huge bucks and now you have to put your primary business on the back burner. You finally fix the camp issue and now you have to repair your primary business because you ignored them while you were saving your other investment. IT is a pendulum that once swinging can easily get out of control. This is not to discourage you but to make you really think before you put your nest egg and your successful business on the line. Now weigh the reward you will never be rich from it. The assets you build will be difficult to sell in most cases. The friends you make will be priceless. So unless you are that special person who can be financially solvent in a case of failure and thrives on making other people happy then my opinion is to get 110 % feedback from people who have provided the vacation and not the people who received the vacation.
