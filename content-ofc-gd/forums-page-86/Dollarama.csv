1005268,SirCranksalot,2017-06-03 12:21:00,3291,I bought a knockoff plano type there but the latches were sticky.  The stock in the different stores seems to vary quite a bit. I have gone looking for items posted here but not much luck.

I have yet to use it on fish,as I haven't  caught  any since I purchased it. LOL  Took a wander in the same store I found my first and they had some 6"" left, so grabbed another. At the back tool wall, they had the larger 9"" one. Same price,$4. Had to get it, as I know it,s going to make a great roast and turkey carver.  If you like a sharp quality knife, I would advise grabbing these. Totally impressed.  The frog supply was pretty much history."
