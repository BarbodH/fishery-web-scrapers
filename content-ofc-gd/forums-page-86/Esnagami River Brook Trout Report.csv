973812,Joeytier,2016-06-15 19:13:00,3990,"Amazing, Chris.  I would definitely love that trip!"
973869,Freshtrax,2016-06-16 01:21:00,2215,"Awesome trip,   call me next time I love me a good bookie hunt. What was the biggest bookie of the trip?"
973875,ckewley,2016-06-16 02:39:00,699,"Eddie caught a real chunky one 4+  & I caught a nice long and fairly chunky, just shy of 22"" 4+, think Brock had one in that range as well. Think most were between 1-3+lbs. How did your trip go man?"
973881,Freshtrax,2016-06-16 03:56:00,2215,Still have 2 days of chasing trout left

974362,spinnerdoc,2016-06-21 01:50:00,556,Damn Chris that is a hell of a trip. Would love to fish that river with a float reel â˜º

974630,MJL,2016-06-23 18:57:00,2427,Great trip and report... it would appear that the only thing it lacked was sunscreen...lol  X2 on the sunsceen.LOL  Man those are beautiful brookies!
974635,manitoubass2,2016-06-23 19:49:00,11391,A guy I work with fishes this place and says its unreal(backed by your report chris)  I brought in some smoked sturgeon for the boys yesterday and he was talking about it  Really makes me wanna add it to the bucket list
974639,mepps,2016-06-23 20:04:00,1301,"Nice report, man! I hope to do a Borger adventure one of these days!"
974939,Moosebunk,2016-06-27 01:22:00,3970,"Lagavulin worthy report Chris. Those SPECKS!!!  Really enjoyed this one and man, you can write and snap some photos too. Cool that Adam made the trip as well.  Over 40 and a wee one at home but still just a big kid at heart who has to play outdoors."
974944,chris.brock,2016-06-27 01:43:00,4053," Thanks Bunk.  The word on the street is you were also being an over 40 big kid at heart, and your playground was Nipigon. Write it up, I wanna hear about it."
1009747,ckewley,2017-07-24 02:12:00,699,"Super nice guy & the camp is what I expected needless to say, I loved it! We went when some of the river was still closed, I'd love to go when it's wide open.....I still dream of the Brookies that were caught!!"

This trip was a bit different because we were on assignment for Mike Borger's publication, Canada Fishing Guide. I was going to handle the online report and Adam was slated to write the print feature. We all jumped at the chance!  I know Mike himself hasn't been on here in months due to too much negative feedback and honestly I don't blame the guy. He's given a lot to this board over the years and I get where he's coming from. Only the people close to him know how much effort he's putting into this passion of his. We're friends, I know him, and up yours to the jealous guys sitting on the couch typing crap.  Anyhow I put together a pretty extensive report (for me) that's now up on the CFG site. Have a look, it's pretty cool especially if you're into brook trout!  http://www.canadafishingguide.net/trident-lake-outpost-a-brook-trout-bonanza/"

Too bad about Mike not being around here anymore though, even though I am sure some of his reports will be scaled back due to the magazine.  Can't wait to read this one."
973589,the spirit of fishing,2016-06-14 13:26:00,141," Really enjoyed reading about your trip. Sounds like a great place to go. As Mike had said to you, it's the people that make the trip and it appears you had a good bunch of guys who all enjoyed the fish cooperating to make it even better. I'll echo what others have said that it's too bad Mike has decided to stay away from here. I understand a few rotten apples can leave a bitter taste when he's trying to share his great experiences. Just hope he realizes that the vast majority of us on here really enjoyed reading about his adventures and all that he contributed to the site."
973594,Sandbag,2016-06-14 14:07:00,533,Awesome report Chris.  I can't get over the colour of some of those Brookies.  Looks like you had a wonderful week minus the blackfly scars. lol  Cheers  Craig
