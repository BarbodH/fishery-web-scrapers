It was the first time I put my new boat in these conditions and for a 14' aluminum and a 15 HP motor, I was very impressed with the way it handled it! It's a Tracker V14 with a 15 HP Fourstroke Mercury. I ran the motor for 5 hours straight and used maybe 5L of gas. With running pretty far in choppy water. We managed to land 4 smallies, not too big and my uncle lost a bigger one. We headed west towards the provincial park and found a shoal on the way there. All the fish were caught in between 12-15' of water. We launch at the free launch in Port Maitland park and the people fishing from the piers were catching drum/sheep head like crazy!  Special thanks to all the board members for there advice, it made a huge difference in our day!  LTF"
