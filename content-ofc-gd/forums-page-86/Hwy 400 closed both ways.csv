1009570,kickingfrog,2017-07-20 19:48:00,8333,The 400 is closed both ways between hwy 9 and 88. Has been closed since about 2:30 this afternoon. That's gotta be a mess for anyone traveling in the area.
1009571,Rodbender,2017-07-20 19:58:00,1027,Info here  http://www.cp24.com/news/hwy-400-closed-north-of-toronto-after-dangerous-goods-spill-opp-1.3511876
1009572,Tjames09,2017-07-20 20:00:00,664,that area of the 400 is awful. Theres always accidents there. They need to re-engineer that section.
1009582,G.mech,2017-07-20 21:11:00,830,that area of the 400 is awful. Theres always accidents there. They need to re-engineer that section.  Some of the things I see people doing on that road tend to make me think that the drivers may need re-engineering more than the roadway....
1009583,SirCranksalot,2017-07-20 21:17:00,3291, Some of the things I see people doing on that road tend to make me think that the drivers may need re-engineering more than the roadway.... Quite!!
1009588,Fisherman,2017-07-20 21:49:00,7201," Some of the things I see people doing on that road tend to make me think that the drivers may need re-engineering more than the roadway....  Exactly, you could drive that stretch at 200 if there was no traffic.  Add traffic and a bunch of texting/phoning idiot drivers and you're just waiting for a crash."
1009592,misfish,2017-07-20 22:23:00,29133,Report is the liquid is paint thinners.
1009593,Fisherman,2017-07-20 22:43:00,7201,Wonder if that will soften up the road..

1009640,Raf,2017-07-21 14:52:00,3495,agreed.  they need to add some chicanes to this drag strip.
1009666,lookinforwalleye,2017-07-22 10:51:00,4399, Some of the things I see people doing on that road tend to make me think that the drivers may need re-engineering more than the roadway.... Indeed....Stop driving 140-160 kmh and stop jumping from lane to lane would be a start!!!
1009667,woodenboater,2017-07-22 12:46:00,2277,centre lane hogs is all I'll say. not as bad as left lane turtles but still...
1009671,Rizzo,2017-07-22 14:01:00,4754,oh man that would have been a total gong show
1009838,fishboy,2017-07-25 02:32:00,550,...it wasn't fun...fortunately the Waze app on my phone had me off at Mapleview heading south and from the 5th line I got to see all the guys going nowhere
1009844,DanD,2017-07-25 10:16:00,2223,"There's always some good that comes out of every situation.     â€‹Hopefully some of the people who received the water and whatnot, will remember when its their turn to help out?  Dan."
1009922,BillM,2017-07-26 13:57:00,17367,Indeed....Stop driving 140-160 kmh and stop jumping from lane to lane would be a start!!!  There's a time and place to speed on that highway and it's definitely not when there's a crapload of traffic.   The worst thing are the guys thinking that weaving in and out of traffic gaining them 10ft over the car behind them is some sort of victory?  lol
