We need a stinking permit here to change a toilet that is 100 bucks. Need to put in a temporary foam ring, remove the toilet for inspection and reinstall said toilet with a wax ring. They can take a Good Poop before I buy any permits for ANYTHING......."
1008769,dave524,2017-07-12 18:00:00,4508,"They can take a Good Poop before I buy any permits for ANYTHING.......  Bought here in '83, the neighbours on both sides and over the back fence are the same people that were here 34 years ago , permits are pretty much issued here for minor stuff with a discussion over the fence"
1008795,Old Ironmaker,2017-07-13 00:55:00,8243,"Why didn't you tell us earlier before we all wasted our time skick?    The problem with that Mr.G is this. The county is submitted a brief legal description of your property at the time of sale by your lawyer each buyer agrees to, ome of those 10 pages we don't read. When the paperwork is submitted to the county/city/town for a sale a brief legal description is then given. i.e. the property was sold in 84 and it was filed as a 1 story single family dwelling on a lot ABC with a single garage, including an out building of XYZ and 3 bedrooms and 1 bath, etc. etc. You don't get any permits since you bought and the legal description drastically changes, a 2 story 2 family home with a deck with egress of X feet by Y feet, 4 bedrooms, 2.5 baths 3 outbuildings and an in ground pool and a hot tub, 200 amp service etc. etc. etc. Guess who is going to explain themselves to the county? You. It's starting to happen around here. They wll get their coin no matter what, believe me. A neighbour had to do a lot of explaining to do last year, the deal fell through. Now he has a choice, put it back the way it was or go through a Nightmare getting it all inspected after the fact and beg forgiveness after paying fines up the yinga yanga."
1009232,captpierre,2017-07-17 16:26:00,2521,Thanks everyone for your input. I've been asking others and a local contractor about this spiral septic system and nobody has heard of one. I have heard that all counties will be inspecting all septics soon. If I put a shed on it I'll likely be in trouble. Might have to set up a tent  instead ?
1009240,Sinker,2017-07-17 17:22:00,8692,"All counties wont be inspecting septic systems. Its just not possible. What are they going to do, dig them up?? They can't even enforce their own by laws now.  If it was me, and its not, I'd already have it built without a second thought. I'd be more concerned about my neighbors than the township. They are the ones who will make the complaint.  I know this is probably bad advice, but it is what I would do without question.  S."
1009242,captpierre,2017-07-17 17:37:00,2521,I'm in Trent Lakes township. I've heard it from several sources that inspections are coming and probably waterfront septics first. Neighbors are fine with the shed where planned.
1008416,captpierre,2017-07-07 22:34:00,2521,"We want to put up a 9x13 ft shed that will have one corner on our septic bed due to space limitations at the cottage. The septic bed is about 20 yrs old. We bought the place 6 yrs ago. The bed is a deep spiral type. Apparently the pipe spirals down in a wide circle, about 15-20 ft in diameter down about 10 ft. The neighbor says he saw them install it. It's about 100 ft from the lake and 20 ft from the cottage which is closer to the lake. The shed is to sit on 2x2ft patio stones. At the 4 corners.  The corner in question will be 1/3  of the way into the spiral. I know you shouldn't weigh down conventional septic beds. Does anybody know anything about these spiral types? Will the shed work? No other place to put it. Thanks Peter"
1008418,cheaptackle,2017-07-07 23:22:00,849,"First thing I'd be checking is if you need a permit to put the shed up at all.  9 x 13 is 117 square feet and most municipalities require permits for structures over 100 square feet, with stamped drawings etc.  In making this enquiry you can, at the same time, find out how to get a photocopy of the as installed septic system to aid you in your layout.  We got the photocopy for a friend in Ramara for just about a buck or two as I recall (just needed to know where it all was).  Of note - it seems you can put up 10 x 10 sheds (100 sq ft) more than once, I've seen some places that look like shanty towns! Getting the layout will greatly help you in determining if you are actually going to be on top of it - the excavation may have gone as far as your neighbour remembered but the piping may well be out of the way.  I am in no way an engineer or such, but have worked in construction most of my life and I've learned that the best way to find out about issues like these is to talk to the building department even if you don't get the answer you want.  Get on their good side and you may find alternatives suggested to help you reach your goal.  Your only other alternatives are to engage an engineer ($$$$$$!!!) or play dumb, which can cost more than an engineer!   The local lumber store staff may also offer some insight but they, like me, aren't recognized as an authority.  Building Inspectors get a bad rep but they do know the codes and are really, when you think about it, there to protect you. Hope these few thoughts help you to find what you need and get the job done!  Good Luck!  Michael"
1008433,Woodsman,2017-07-08 09:50:00,1286,I'd think twice about asking the local government about a drawing of your septic system. If the former owner installed without a proper permit & inspection they may order it's removal. Why take the chance.

1008435,Garnet,2017-07-08 11:16:00,2056,"I agree with don't rattle the bushes.  I would build ""L"" shed not encroaching on septic. And never let vehicles drive over the septic bed."
1008439,Rizzo,2017-07-08 12:35:00,4754,people drive lawn tractors etc over septic...would corner of shed but that much heavier?
1008442,dave524,2017-07-08 13:04:00,4508,"people drive lawn tractors etc over septic...would corner of shed but that much heavier?  The soil above a septic bed needs to be able to breathe, solid concrete or compaction from traffic is a problem, also the laterals can only be to a certain depth, else it won't work properly. You can't put in a septic bed and then go raising the grade above it later, either."
1008444,Garnet,2017-07-08 14:01:00,2056,The shed not likely. The crap stored in shed constantly.

Ask for Bernie and say you're a long time enemy of yves.  I've never heard of this spiral type system. I guess the idea is that water will travel out in this spiral.... Not sure if this would work.  And as others have said, maybe it's not code so best to keep it hush hush."

He said they take less room than a traditional septic bed.  I don't really have any more information than the fact that they do exist."
1008449,G.mech,2017-07-08 15:37:00,830,"If you make your shed over over 10 square metres (107 sq. ft.) you are required by the OBC to get a building permit (your 9x13 is just over this).  If you go to get a permit, you will have to show your site plan with at least 5m setback from any structure to your tile bed which sounds like a show stopper.  Building on top of a tile bed is never a good idea but if that's what you need to do, you'd be best to spread the load as much as possible on patio stones to prevent soil complaction and make your shed a bit smaller to avoid the permit application.   I don't see a lot of other options."
1008451,Sterling,2017-07-08 15:54:00,477,"Crazy idea, how far does the shed extend into the septic bed? And do you need to have a stone in the corner? Could you offset multiple stones closer to the centre of the shed and get away with that? Know what I mean?"
1008473,Sinker,2017-07-09 02:06:00,8692,"I wouldny hesitate to build it, but thats just me. How are your neighbours? They are the ones you need to worry about....8f they complain."
1008534,Mister G,2017-07-10 09:08:00,1429,"Build the shed 9X11 so only 99 sq, then build the roof to over hang the walls by as much as 2 ft or more for LOTS of attic storage if need be.........now you have a shed that's under the 100 sq yet you still have plenty of storage in the attic area.  One corner of the shed wouldn't bother me over the septic area.........and don't forget, you can always roll the shed off that corner if need be by using PVC pipes under it."
1008613,aplumma,2017-07-10 23:05:00,6896,If you build it and it is on the septic field what is the reaction of the county? Where I am if you do this they can make you remove the building and condemn your septic field until you have it certified by an engineering company. $$$$ Personally I would not violate my drainfield because if it is damaged you are close to the water and that would be another can of worms if they can find traces of septic waste or bacteria in the lake.

1008724,Old Ironmaker,2017-07-12 01:32:00,8243,"Again G. Mech is 110% bang on. 20 years ago one could build anything on 6 Nations reserve any way they wanted. Not today all codes apply from the North American Building Code, OBC and all the way to individual County Codes and regs.  I wouldn't want to open a can of worms over a small shed and if I were I wouldn't risk a bed not performing or even failing over a stinkin' shed to hold a mower and a few shovels. Reward not worth the risk."
