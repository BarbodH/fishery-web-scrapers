I am sure that is not a lot to some of you on here, so i will contribute when i can.  I have fished east to west, and currently get to fish almost every day even if its ten minutes or so. Started out fishing local tribes around the Oakville area as a kid. At about the age of twelve i caught my first steelhead and from that moment on when the timing  is right i focus mainly on those buggers. During the summer i try to get out somewhere different every weekend and in the recent years have shifted my summer time focus to walleye. ahhh the bachelor life!   I have been fishing above big chute for the past 15 years or so.........all started with a girl I met up there. I have caught the odd walleye  over the years targeting bass and pike but have not been able to consistently put walleye in the boat, mind you I did not spend A ton of time targeting them as I did not believe the population was targetable. I love the waterway and would love to be able to catch a few more walleye. I have searched online for years for any info I could get my hands on. A few members on here have mentioned that they had fished it  so I figured I would reach out.  I would consider myself a  accomplished angler for almost every species. And am willing to give up my spots and times of the year to the rite people, and now that I have joined this site I plan on sharing my knowledge with others.   I have a friend up there that lets me pitch a tent for free whenever i want, so it is a very cost effective place for me to fish.  â€‹Headed up there again Monday Tuesday next week regardless to attempt to target them solely. I know there are not lot in there but any help would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks for having me on the site!"

1009446,grimsbylander,2017-07-19 19:38:00,3016,Hi and welcome. I've not fished above the chute much but fished below it a ton. Good luck!
1009451,GBW,2017-07-19 19:55:00,8460,Welcome to the site Doug. I have never fished the area you are talking about but a jig and grub may be the hot ticket.  Others may swear by a worm harness.  Good luck either way.
1009452,brooktrout88,2017-07-19 20:12:00,6,thanks guys!
