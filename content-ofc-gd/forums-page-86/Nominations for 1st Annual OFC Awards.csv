I miss them both. Those long phone calls and talks on the boat and on the deck with Brian I really miss. He was a ""Far away talker"". When he spoke he sounded like he was 50' away and he's 5 feet away in the boat. Soft yelling may be a way to describe it. I told him quit yelling, he yelled back ""I'm not yelling"" and he really wasn't. After all that time we shot the Bull I didn't know he ran his own D.J. service for years. Maybe that explains the soft yelling. I have not met many people that could keep up with him slamming back Beer I tell ya'. I don't know where he put it all and I never saw him blitzed. I put out a beer for him and I, go back in the cottage to get something and he's done. After a while I learned to give him 2 at a time. I once said ""Bri you can have all the beer you want here bud but 1 more and you have to sleep here"". ""With Ticha?"" he asks. I said ""no you can't sleep with her but you can scrub her back in the shower, I'll get you a step ladder."" We had a laugh. He was a funny guy. I miss the duffus."

Im thinking crap, he can't drive anywhere, plus he's gonna eat/drink everything I have lol  Runs to his truck, grabs 12 tall boys, cracks one. Talks about his truck for what seemed like 6 hours.
