1009720,popofish!,2017-07-23 19:56:00,41,"I've been trying out some Lake O trolling from my kayak for the first time this year. Considering I have no trolling experience whatsoever, I've managed to get into some fish almost every trip out so far. Aside from one 15lb chinook, I've yet to catch a larger salmon this year. I'm hoping it will happen sooon enough. I'm learning as I go. Here are some pictures. Enjoy!      "

1009722,popofish!,2017-07-23 20:22:00,41,It's pretty rewarding. You don't have the benefit of being in a large boat but you are much more involved in the trolling process. Especially if you are paddling like myself. A lot of guys have foot paddles and trolling motors so it makes things even easier.
1009724,misfish,2017-07-23 20:33:00,29133,"Welcome to the board  pv  What is your set up for trolling ?  How fast do you think you were paddling ?  Nice fish  As you can see in my avatar, I am a float boat guy as well. I do want to head down and give it a try. I like to fish GB casting."
1009725,aplumma,2017-07-23 20:52:00,6896,Very nice thanks for sharing. I troll with a yak on some local lakes and it is quite exciting when you hook up with a large fish.  Art

Nice fish  As you can see in my avatar, I am a float boat guy as well. I do want to head down and give it a try. I like to fish GB casting.  I use a torpedo diver clipped directly to my line to get my baits down anywhere from 30ft to 70ft. Right now I have 4oz and 8oz torpedo divers. They are fairly good when it comes to resistance. So far I've caught all my fish on straight spoons but I am starting to get into flasher/flies in hope of catching a bigger salmon. I use a Navionics phone app to measure my speed, which is generally around 2.5-2.8mph. Eventually I got the hang of how fast I need to go without anything but I still like the app because I can track my movements and mark where I've caught fish."
1009729,Freshtrax,2017-07-23 22:30:00,2215,That's awesome I'd love to catch one from a kayak.  Please put a big flag on your kayak .  You guys are really hard to see untill the last min during dawn and dusk.

You guys are really hard to see untill the last min during dawn and dusk.  I'm working on putting up a flag and lighting system right now. For now I'm just staying off the water when visibility is not good.
1009737,FloatnFly,2017-07-24 00:35:00,1640,awesome fish! but ditch the boga grips
1009758,singingdog,2017-07-24 11:38:00,1047,"Nothing wrong with a boga grip. Used correctly, it's a great release tool. I have used it on hundreds of fish, of multi species, with no issues at all."
1009765,Acountdeleted,2017-07-24 13:10:00,2562,"Very cool!  You are a brave lad. I took my kayak to the islands once, launched out of cherry beach and the wind picked up on my way back. Was a little scary.  Also some beauty fish there."

I think 3mph+ is preferred. But I'm sure you're somewhat limited on a kayak ."
1009770,popofish!,2017-07-24 13:39:00,41,"jeremy84 As you can see from some of the pictures, I am very careful to plan each trip out so that I am on the water only when the lake is dead calm. I track the wind and know when I can go out and when to stay home. Besides the safety aspect, it's just more enjoyable being on the water when there are no waves."
1009771,popofish!,2017-07-24 13:43:00,41,Sterling I can go faster than 3mph. So far most of my hits have come at that 2.5mph speed. I am still learning when it comes to that though. Last time I tried trolling a flasher/fly and ended up with a big tangled mess  I assumed it was because I was going too fast. Would you just troll straight spoons 3+mph or everything?
1009776,porkpie,2017-07-24 15:09:00,2521,I have been catching kings on meat rigs as slow as 1.9mph on GPS.  2.5-2.6 is a good clip while pulling paddles.  You often need to adjust speed to compensate  for current depending on the direction of your troll.  Some nice fish there!
1009923,BillM,2017-07-26 13:59:00,17367,"You don't have to go 3+mph to catch big kings, 2.5mph is fine..   You might get 3mph out of your baits (Or more) depending on the winds and current."
