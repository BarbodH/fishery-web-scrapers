1009141,Jen,2017-07-16 21:05:00,833,"Welcome Andrew, try emailing your pictures to yourself. Outlook will ask you if you would like to make them smaller, choose the appropriate size you need for here. Open the email, resale the smaller pictures and you should be golden.  I hope you truly enjoy the wonderful people on here. They have many talents beyond fishing! Talk, share and listen... you will discover for yourself what they are."
1009197,Old Ironmaker,2017-07-17 09:27:00,8243,Welcome aboard Andrew. I hope you enjoy your journey here. A lot of orb breaking here if you know what I mean.  Now as far as Bass having a lower I.Q. than other fish some Bassassins may not agree with you.

My first boat was a 14.5' Sea Nymth from there.  i actually got my boat off the owner of the company my dad runs, he bought it when he bought a cottage but never used it, its a 1992 (same age as me) thing is still like brand new. Im always down to fish or explore so when ever you want to come hit me up!.  ive never been into harcourt park since its private but its a 5 minute drive from my place haha. typical lakes up there i fish are cope lake, hudson (by canoe) elephant, benoir, baptiste, farqher and cardiff i want to get into more of the smaller ones thinking of buying a fishing kayak. we're on cope lake road so im familiar with cope the most."
