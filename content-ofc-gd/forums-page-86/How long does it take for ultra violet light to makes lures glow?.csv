1009468,Bill Shearer,2017-07-19 23:55:00,456,Thirty seconds to a minute is usually all it takes for the lures I use
1009581,aplumma,2017-07-20 21:00:00,6896,The 30 second charge will get it to glow a 2 minute charge will glow brighter and longer. Any longer than that the return is marginal.   Art
1009585,Bill Shearer,2017-07-20 21:38:00,456,Art is correct. What Ive found is that sometimes a bright lure catches nothing. Other times they want it bright. Probably depends on water clarity and lighting on the pier etc. So start out with a two minute charge and then work your way down to 30 seconds using ten casts as your base. Adjust from there
1009602,John Bacon,2017-07-20 23:52:00,3277,Thanks for the information.  Right now I am using it for trolling; so the 10 casts doesn't really apply.
