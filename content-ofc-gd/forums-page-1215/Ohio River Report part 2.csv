72015,mattyk,2007-05-15 22:45:00,2110,Well I was able to land my first paddle fish at the falls of the ohio river. Put up and very nice fight on light line. She was caught on a two inch jig. I was    also caught about 20 white bass and tons of skip jack herring. I also caught some type of a fish that i cant identify. I think it is a type of a carp. Any ideas?  Paddle Fish (she was returned back to the river to swim again)   What type of a fish is this? (some type of a carp?)   Skip Jack herring 
72020,Victor,2007-05-15 22:58:00,1609,that fish is so cool!! must have put up an amazing fight with those big fins!  would the 2nd fish be a smallmouth buffalo?  thanks for the pics!
72021,bucktail,2007-05-15 22:58:00,1857,Might be a buffalo fish but its awfully silver for one.
72033,solopaddler,2007-05-15 23:27:00,8605,"Cool looking paddlefish bud! The fish you can't identify is a quillback sucker, member of the carp family actually...."
72159,OhioFisherman,2007-05-16 10:00:00,6623,Nice job Matt!
72162,Rich Clemens,2007-05-16 10:09:00,3131,Attaboy Mike.  Never seen a paddle fish ... cool lookin' fish.
72166,gozwob,2007-05-16 10:54:00,34,cool paddlefish!!
72168,BryceBurzynski,2007-05-16 10:56:00,181,Congrats!
72169,Spiel,2007-05-16 10:57:00,9065,"....Now there's a combination of fish I can't say I've ever encountered, nicely done. My first thoughts on that second fish was that it might be a buffalo but I think Solopaddler hit the nail on the head.  (quillback)"
72181,Whopper,2007-05-16 11:31:00,2174,"That paddle fish is pretty cool Matt.  Good on you for catching.  After yesterday the river will be rising and muddy, got some much needed rain.  Whopper"
72187,ccmtcanada,2007-05-16 12:01:00,7971,"Cool!!! That paddlefish looks amazing...congrats on your first catch.  I also concur with solo....it's a quillback.  The buffalo was a good guess, but when I looked at a few pics, the shape and position of the mouth says paddle."
72199,mattyk,2007-05-16 12:49:00,2110,"I think your right solopaddler the second fish does look like a quillback. It was a strange combination of fish that i caught, and you never do know what you will catch in the ohio river."
72203,tonyb,2007-05-16 13:02:00,1637,I have paddlefish envy now...very nicely done on the mixed bag of unusual species!  Tony
72207,b2kptbo,2007-05-16 13:11:00,1505,"That paddle fish is very cool, have never seen one, great report..."
72209,Joey,2007-05-16 13:13:00,9122,Very cool looking fish.  Good going  Joey
72221,Raf,2007-05-16 13:31:00,3495,Nice job.  Those paddlefish look like they belong in the ocean.
72277,ehg,2007-05-16 16:26:00,2666,"Another great report of mixed species! Are there still muskies in that part of the Ohio River?  I think that paddlefish are filter feeders.  Very nice,  ehg"
72291,fishindevil,2007-05-16 16:51:00,6254,"WOW....thats quite a mixed bag of fish for sure.  ...congrats on that cool looking paddlefish,and ive never seen any of those before thanks for sharing,and great pics as well....cheers"
72439,mattyk,2007-05-16 23:12:00,2110,no muskies that i know of in the ohio river in this area.  Some of the smaller feeder rivers to the ohio river have muskies in them.
