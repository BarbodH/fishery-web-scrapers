I do have lots of Batteries .. so hopefully no excuses  And yes Joe ...

I just dont see jube-jubes and 20 yr old port working
72844,douG,2007-05-18 01:36:00,2693,"Milio, it's all up to you.  Just make it how you like.  Good luck, btw.  And, a ZEC is a Controlled Ecology Zone, like a provincial park in the rest of Canada.  Those French have a different word for everything."
