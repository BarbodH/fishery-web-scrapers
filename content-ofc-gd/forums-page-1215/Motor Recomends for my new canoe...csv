70353,Sawyer,2007-05-11 02:56:00,48,"Black Blade,  I have a 15 ft. flat back canoe.  Since 2004, I've had a minkotta 35 lbs thrust trolling motor.  It worked really well in small reservoirs.  It worked just fine for larger bodies of water (e.g., scugog).  The trick is, try and get the largest marine battery as possible.  Your canoe will be able to handle it.  I agree with the members on this board that your decision will be based on how you travel on the water.  At first, the trolling motor served me well as it was aligned with my purpose.  However, last season - my experience at scugog was awesome - but I wanted to go explor other parts of the lake and the trolling motor just won't cut it.  My purpose has changed.  This week I purchased a 2 horse power honda outboard.  I can only imagine how much water I can now cover.  Good luck with your decision.  Best,  Sawyer"
70408,danbouck,2007-05-11 11:04:00,4380,"  I agree If you fish Conservation Areas a lot, i would get an electric motor. Otherwise gas all the way."
70435,Black_Blade,2007-05-11 12:26:00,258," Saywer, did you get your 2 hp new?  Just wondering how much they go for, guess would have to go to closest marine dealer around here (have to dig out the yellow pages..lol)  Of course, still would have to put this proposed ""bill for purchase"" for a reading through parliament here and be prepared to argue my case..."

71069,Canoe2fish,2007-05-13 14:42:00,42,"I bought a 30lb elec. for my 14' Scott square stern. As sombody else said, its ok on calm day's. (then again its a heavy canoe with a wide beam, usually occupied by 2 adults) I still plan on buying a 2hp gas someday for some remote canoe camping and fishing...but for now its good for the conservation areas.  I'd like to put swivel seats in it also as its a PITA to sit sideways in a canoe to operate the throttle...pretty narrow & awkward. If I was only ever going to use just electrics on a canoe (for conservation areas or rivers), I think I would have chosen a lighter canoe that was more efficient for paddling or use it with a side mount set up for a trolling motor instead."
71202,Sawyer,2007-05-13 23:14:00,48,"Blackblade,  I bought my 2 horse power used.  The deal came with a dingie (sp?).  I bought the entire combination for $500.  The seller only used the motor 3-4 times one year. Her husband bought the motor 7-8 years ago and suffered a stroke the same year.  My buddy and I checked it out and it looks great.  A brand new honda 2 hp go for $1000.00 these days.  Check them out.  What I want to do is to take my trolling motor and mount it on the bow.  So I'll use the gas motor to get to the 'honey' hole and cover extra water on larger bodies of water.  While fishing the spot, my trolling motor kicks in....we'll see how it goes  -Sawyer"
71677,Dabluz,2007-05-15 01:19:00,701,"I have a 14 foot Sportspal.  I would say that you should buy a small gas engine for it.  Even a 4 cycle 2 h.p. motor weighs only about 30 lbs.....which is less weight than a battery and electric motor.  Then, buy a small electric motor.  They are cheap.  I use a 9 lb thrust 3 speed Minn Kota 15 and I can go against some pretty strong current and even at it's lowest speed, I find that it is still too fast for trolling.  However, a 30 lb thrust electric motor only costs about 130 dollars new.  I'm sure you can find a used electric motor real cheap."
72570,Black_Blade,2007-05-17 09:51:00,258,LOL here I am looking into getting motors for the canoe...but have yet to find out how good or bad it paddles yet
72601,Fly Me In Scotty,2007-05-17 13:15:00,34,I have a 40# Maxxum Minn Kota on the back of my 17' coleman square back. I mounted the swivel seats on and took it out to Guelph Lake.  I am very happy with the entire outfit right now. It is heavy with the battery and I know I wouldnt be portaging anywhere with that set up.  Down the line a small 2hp would be nice but for now I am on the water and  happy.
72648,Entropy,2007-05-17 15:46:00,747,"If you can swing it put two 4 hp 2 stroke mercs on the back use both for your high speed run down the lake,  only 1 for troling and possitioning.  "
72681,Dabluz,2007-05-17 17:06:00,701," I have the real old Sportspal....the one with the foam seats that are stored in the points of the canoe.  From a sitting position, it can be paddled.  When alone, the paddler must move towards the middle of the canoe to paddle and the canoe is quite wide plus there are the foam flottation cushions on the outside so it's better to sit near the edge of the canoe to make it tilt a bit and allow easier access with the paddle.  It's not a real easy canoe to paddle but most of the time, I paddle the canoe and rarely use any kind of motor.  The Sportspal's width makes it slow down faster between strokes and the outside finish on the canoe creates drag too.  I don't know if the Sportspal still comes with oar locks but mine has them and in heavy wind, using the oars is a definite advantage.  The Sportspal is not for paddling long distances or leisure sightseeing and exploration....it's a fishing canoe....and a great one for that purpose.  For slowly trolling a fly or lure while paddling, it's great and not tiring but it does not move fast like a sleek narrow long distance paddling canoe.  The best paddling position is in a kneeling position with your rear end just resting on the foam seat.  It's best to put down a good soft impermeable cushion on the floor of the canoe so you knees dont rest on any of the aluminum ribs that hold the foam carpet in place.  The Sportspal also has a tendancy to leak a bit.  Applying sealant to the interieur seams is a good idea.  The Sportspal is also easy to tow.  Use the towing holes that are found at either end of the double pointed Sportspal.  They are well placed closer to the water level and eliminate any wandering from side to side.  I like to rest my rod against the gunwale and in order to reduce noise or eliminate scratching the rod, I apply a strip of foam weather stripping.  It's cheap and easy to replace."
72682,Nemo,2007-05-17 17:06:00,727,Ok now you got he 2 hp how are you going to attach it to the canoe?
72683,Nemo,2007-05-17 17:07:00,727,Ooops my bad I see it's a sqaure stern. Carry on..
66133,BFSC Kevin,2007-04-30 15:38:00,1351,"I plan on finding a scanoe for myself aswell. but i have a 12footer with a motor and a 55lb maxxum minn kota... way more then enough but like everyone says, more power the better.. so i plan on using my 55lb maxxum on the canoe when i find one, then sell the 12footer and bump up to a 16footer.."
66210,jediangler,2007-04-30 19:34:00,1923,Well haulinbass I did buy a special mount for my fish finder transducer so that I could mount it to the bottom of my trolling motor. This way wherever my trolling motor goes my fishfinder goes too. It's great when using rentals. You can get one anywhere Eagle accessories are sold. When the water gets shallow the transducer comes up with the motor and is protected from rocks on the bottom. Other than that I used stainless steel bolts and lock nuts and drilled and bolted all the ribs in my Sportspal to the hull of the canoe. This keeps them from popping out while in the water or on the roof of my vehicle.
66625,Guest lundboy,2007-05-01 18:16:00,0,  I think you will be surprised how fast it will go!!  A 2HP on a canoe will make it go about 15+mph! Pretty scary in a canoe.
66745,tjsa,2007-05-01 23:33:00,1578,"I cannot comment on electrics, never used them. But I do fish in a canoe most of the summer. We carry it in, portage it, etc. lots of places, and gas is the only way to go up here. Mind you, I am talking about traveling many kms. up, or down rivers, portaging, etc.  Not uncommon for us to make a trek involving over 20 kms, so, batteries are not the way to go.  It all depends on where you fish, one lake, right off of the launch, electric may work just fine. Seen it used many times. For me, going back 3-4 lakes, gas is the only way to go.  I have a 3.3 mariner, my bud a 2.2 johnson. Take the cowlings off of them, and its basically the same motor, mine has a neutral gear, his does not.  Both use about the same amount of gas though. We just carry a 4 litre cas can for refills. Under full power, lasts us 14 kms approx. Trolling, about 4 hrs., and since we only day trip, the full tank on the motor, plus the gas in the can makes for a full day with reserve easily."
66887,Black_Blade,2007-05-02 03:56:00,258,"It seems that electrics are easier to come by and cheaper in the short term, but I am leaning to eventually scoring a little gas unit.  Gonna just keep an eye out for whatever deals show up in classifieds etc.  No rush, can paddle or oar it around for the time being.  Thanks for the detailed info, tjsa.  I am hoping to make a trip into Algonquin and other nice remote spots, at some point, hopfully my son will be into it but we'll see.  He's 15 and by that time I was out camping and fishing with my buddies without parents etc....but that was like 25 yrs ago too....have to compete with video games and computers nowadays"
66888,danbo,2007-05-02 04:06:00,2646,Two friends with paddles are kinda handy too!
66938,fishbait,2007-05-02 11:59:00,23,I have the same type and have a 4 hp with the gas tank on the top. great for back woods stuff
66991,Fly Me In Scotty,2007-05-02 14:04:00,34,"JediAngler,  Thanks for the tip. This is a great idea and I plan on doing the same. I also plan on putting in the comfortable seats with the quick release to make sure I can withstand a full day on the water.  Great thread.  It does sound like i also will be looking long term for a small outboard for diversity.  Has anyone done a canopy of sorts for their rig on this board?"
66997,Entropy,2007-05-02 14:17:00,747," My brother-inlaw also has a 4 hp merc on this kind of canoe, works great !!"
