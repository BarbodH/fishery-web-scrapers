72342,wildminnow,2007-05-16 18:55:00,27,going to be heading north from international falls to ear falls anyone have any places that are must stops either something to see or somewhere to eat.  Dont want to miss anything great along the way!
72355,rickster,2007-05-16 19:25:00,495,Which way are you heading to ear falls? Up the 502hwy through Dryden or up towards Kenora and then over to ear falls?
72371,wildminnow,2007-05-16 19:56:00,27,open to either way right now what would you suggest
72375,rickster,2007-05-16 20:05:00,495,Hwy 502 to Dryden is more of a remote scenic route but the highway is not in as good as condition. The Kenora way will put you through Nestor Falls and Sioux Narrows which have nice attractions to see. I am sure you will enjoy either way    Rick
