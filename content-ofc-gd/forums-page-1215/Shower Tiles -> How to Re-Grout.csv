I have been told I can simply re-grout them.  How does one do this?  What products do I need?  Any experiences doing this yourself?	Or, should I just call someone and have them do it (what would that be worth) ?  I would like to put a surround in but we first need to save some $$ up for fixing the garage.  So re-grouting sounds like the best solution to get us through the next 3 to 5 years.  Entropy"
72238,Gerritt,2007-05-16 14:16:00,6129,need a bit more info.. sanded or unsanded grout?  grouting is easily replaced and not expensive.   let me know.   Ger.

72243,Entropy,2007-05-16 14:27:00,747,  It is beige tile about 5x5 or 6x6 with a dull white grout in-between.  ??
72245,Gerritt,2007-05-16 14:31:00,6129,then it is more then likely sanded grout and hard as a rock....unsanded grout is alot easier to remove... go to home depot and get a cheap grout saw and your off to the races!  let me know if you have any more questions;   ger.
72253,Entropy,2007-05-16 15:11:00,747, Thanks very much for the info.  I guess it will be the week of July 16 that I will be able to do this project.  Thanks agian Entropy

Check to make sure none of the tiles are loose or you are wasting your time re-grouting them. To check just knock on them with your knuckle and you will hear the hollow difference from a tile that is well bonded to the wall.  Good Luck, Bob"
72257,Entropy,2007-05-16 15:21:00,747," There is one loose tile on the outside of the shower curtain, it is a part of the trim tile (if that makes sense).  It is long and narrow.  I guess I would just pull it off the rest of the way, scrape the adhesive off it and the wall and apply new adhesive.  Then do the re-grout. ??  Does that sound right?  Entropy"
72284,Billy Bob,2007-05-16 16:44:00,5865,"YES, you got the right idea.  I did a whole wall like that back in December. The long wall had over 300 tiles that had to be scraped off. I replace the wall board but I can tell you it was a BIG job scraping off all those tiles. Bottom line though was $80 in material compared to a $1000 or more if I had to purchase new tiles because the WHOLE bathroom is tiled and I couldn't match new tiles with the old tiles."
