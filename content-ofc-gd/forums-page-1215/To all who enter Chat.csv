To those who log into chat, please have your sound turned up. When people enter chat, and no one responds to your entering, we don't know you are there if we are surfing the intermet, or otherwise distracted. Typing in our username, and hitting the enter button, in chat, sends us a bleep through our sound cards to notify us someone else has logged in.   I missed Muskieman, and Corey just by a few seconds tonight, lol."
