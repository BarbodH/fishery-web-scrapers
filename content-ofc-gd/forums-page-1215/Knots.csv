I've traditionaly used the trilene because I know how to do it well, but find it hard on certain hooks, especially when your hands are cold. Used the polamar a few times with Fireline and hated it. I kept losing strikes when the line would snap at the hook (that was before anyone told me to wet the line before your tighten it as well.) I thought fireline worked well after it had been the water a few days but was very fragile until it balanced so I don't like it for use as leaders on spinner rigs that won't be in the water until you tie it on. Have had good success the past year with Shakespears Cajun Red. Casts well, trolled fine and not too much stretch."
72547,mikeymikey,2007-05-17 03:56:00,376,"i only use polamar because i can't remember how to tie anything else.    , what do you recommend for tie main line straight to lures?"
72548,Sinker,2007-05-17 04:01:00,8692,"Have a look at some of these.  http://www.animatedknots.com/  Personally, I use the improved clinch for everything, and never have a problem. With braid, I burn the tag end off, just in case it wants to slip a little, the burnt nub won't slip thru all the way. I find fluoro, you really need to get it good and wet before you pull it tight.

72551,Coach B,2007-05-17 04:08:00,18,Great site - thanks! I like how it walks you through it.
72560,GbayGiant,2007-05-17 05:20:00,1780,"I use the improved clinch for everything to, lol,  I didn't even know what it was called until I just looked at that site. Even tying leaders I just use it twice back to back, it never fails and works great with braid to. The funny thing is no one ever taught me any knots, I use to sit around and just make different knots until I found that one, now it's all I use."
72561,Hooked,2007-05-17 05:26:00,891,"I use improved clinch for mono and flouro mostly, uni for superlines, and I too also burn the end."
72565,OhioFisherman,2007-05-17 08:28:00,6623,"Improved clinch for me also, easy to tie and no breaking problems. I don`t use floro much just some vanish but used it on that also."
72652,fishindevil,2007-05-17 15:54:00,6254,"Great site,and over the years i have forgoten how to tie several knots,  well now i can freshen up again,thanks for sharing that site......cheers"
72662,Baius,2007-05-17 16:22:00,5,Just wondering if anyone uses instant glue on their knots?  I purchased a waterproof glue at CTC and some knot glue at BPS. Does it work?
72717,mattyk,2007-05-17 18:40:00,2110,"cool website, thanks for posting the link."
72749,Sinker,2007-05-17 21:05:00,8692,"I'm pretty sure I got that link from this site....so, don't thank me  It is a good one tho.....  Sinker"
72753,Black_Blade,2007-05-17 21:20:00,258,"great site...better than the one I was going to for refreshers.  I have used the Uni on my Power Pro and mono with no probs, but if it helps will try the Trilene for any floro leaders..."
