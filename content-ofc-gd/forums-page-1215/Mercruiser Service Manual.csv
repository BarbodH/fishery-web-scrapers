72353,barrystrs,2007-05-16 19:16:00,75,"I recently purchased an older boat that has problems.   I think the u joints are worn out and the water pump is leaking.  I tried to get a manual from the library, Canadian Tire, and went to a marina, the marina said they ordered one in the fall and it still hasn't come in.  Does anyone have an old one they would be willing to sell, or a suggestion where to get one?   It is a 1980 mercruiser 170 hp 4cyl ford.  The outdrive says 470 on it.  Thanks Barry 905 985-3215"
