The Rick Amsbury Memorial Pro Am Presented by Shimano Canada   Lindsay, ON – Fleming College Foundation in partnership with Shimano Canada and the Competitive Sport Fishing League will be hosting the 1st Annual Rick Amsbury Memorial Pro Am beginning at 8 am on Wednesday, August 1st, 2007 at Rivera Park on Sturgeon Lake in Lindsay, Ontario.  Amateurs will be randomly paired with one of 100 professional anglers including such legends as Bob Izumi, Dave Mercer, Rocky Crawford, Mike Miller and many more! The event will include a buffet dinner after the tournament, amazing prizes for the top 20 teams including a fishing boat, provided by Lund Boats, motor provided by Mercury Marine and trailer provided by ShoreLand’r Trailers! The evening will also include a silent auction full of one-of-a-kind items. The cost for each amateur is $350. Andrew Pallotta of the Competitive Sport Fishing League will serve as the tournament organizer. Rick Amsbury, was a leader in Canada’s outdoor community. He spent his free time fishing, hunting and selflessly teaching others about our outdoor heritage and the important difference our conservation legacy has made and continues to make to all Canadians. Rick dedicated his considerable professional talents and abilities to the Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters, helping to make them the largest conservation organization in Canada. As Executive Director of the Canadian Sportfishing Industry Association, Rick led the initiative with government agencies coast to coast to promote fishing to people of all ages – especially young anglers.  Funds raised through this event will be matched by the Ontario Government and will contribute to the Rick Amsbury Memorial Student Bursary Fund. This $2,000 bursary is awarded each year to a full-time 2nd year student in the Fish & Wildlife Program who demonstrates an active involvement in both hunting & fishing and is in need of financial assistance in order to complete his/ her studies.

72250,Terry,2007-05-16 14:46:00,14456,"it's on a wed......... 8am, guess some of the pros don't like to get up too early or it take s Bob a while to get through the timmies drive thru in the morning....lol  could be a fun day"
72255,Guest mistyriver1,2007-05-16 15:14:00,0,I fished my only Pro-am two years ago at a CSFL event on Scugog.  Had a great time.  My wife had arranged it for my 40th birthday.  Got to fish with Pete Bowman.  Andy (organizer) is a great guy.
72260,misfish,2007-05-16 15:25:00,29133,"Hey Roger,theres one in August as well.It,s called the Indy pro/am.  August 15th out of Goreskis ,on the Bog. Same one Misty was in Im sure.    CSFL"
72290,bowshep,2007-05-16 16:51:00,378,At what skill leave should l be at. l don't want to have the pro's draging me behind the boat. Peace Ken
72293,Terry,2007-05-16 16:56:00,14456,"if you can hold on to a fishing rod if you can hang on to a boat going 120kph then your skill level is good to go so go and have fun, you will learn more in a day then in 2 years of fishing by yourself"
72310,tundra,2007-05-16 17:31:00,18,I was thinking of giving that AM thing a try    but I'm going to have to wait til next year and plan my schedule better  .
72321,Steelcat,2007-05-16 17:53:00,191,One more skill you might need:  Net fish skill
72322,misfish,2007-05-16 17:59:00,29133," Right away you  should ask your pro if he/she would like you to net the fish. I tended not to,as I didnt want to be the guy that knocked the big one off.  bowshep,go for it dude.You will have a great time.Just the ride alone is worth the price of admission.LOL"
72325,bowshep,2007-05-16 18:13:00,378,l tried the web suite and something is wrong with the suite title    Peace    Ken
72326,motv8tr,2007-05-16 18:15:00,2587,"Would love to give it a try, I can only imagine how much I could learn, sadly, though I'm sure it's worth it, the cost is too steep for me at the moment.  If anyone goes, don't forget your camera and be prepared to give a long report  Maureen"
72328,misfish,2007-05-16 18:18:00,29133,
72361,brandon,2007-05-16 19:38:00,857,What's the deal with this wed morning stuff?  I have a feeling one key reason theres lots of am spots available is because most amateurs have jobs.  That's the reason I won't be signing up.
72379,huntervasili,2007-05-16 20:17:00,1604,shoot... i'd have signed up for sure except i will be in quebec till the 11th... Ohh well maybe the next one... thanks for posting this BTW
72382,misfish,2007-05-16 20:21:00,29133," Brandon I have no idea why,but atleast they are offering it.I would think because of all the series Andy runs,the weekends are all booked up."
72385,motv8tr,2007-05-16 20:29:00,2587,"  Brandon, I'm sorry you can't make it because of work, maybe you could get sick for that one day    . There are loads of people, myself included, who work weekends, and therefore miss out on most of these things and more, therefore having it on a Wed. can be considered a good thing, it's all a matter of perspective I guess.  Maureen"
72432,Nater,2007-05-16 23:01:00,68,To bad its just a 1 day event...any idea what time boats have to be in at?  Nate
72444,misfish,2007-05-16 23:23:00,29133,Check out the site dude.
72456,fliptheslop,2007-05-16 23:50:00,112,"Im in, who cares what day of the week it is, everyday fishing is a good day"
72460,misfish,2007-05-16 23:54:00,29133,Ya got that right.Just to bad this year those days are spread so far apart.  Have a good time FTS.
