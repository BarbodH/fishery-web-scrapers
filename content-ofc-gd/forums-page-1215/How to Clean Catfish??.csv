72311,rtrudeau,2007-05-16 17:34:00,57,"Thanks guys, Brian, I need to know how to get the skin off quick b'fore I filet it, Thanks for post though, Ryan"
72347,Daplumma,2007-05-16 18:59:00,1961,I fllet quite a few catfiah a year and was taught ot pull the skin off with pliers.I have since figured out it is much easier to filet them like and other fish just use a knife to remove the skin like you would a bass or walleye. Joe
72360,misfish,2007-05-16 19:38:00,29133,"What fun is there in that Joe.LOL  Never felited one before,guess I,ll give it a go.  BTW,Zehrs had a great cajun cat filet ,already for the fry pan."
72405,aplumma,2007-05-16 21:39:00,6896,I got the easiest way in the world to clean catfish. First you drop Joe off on an island because he has to pee. Then float the cooler of fish over to him and tell him you wont pick him up till they are clean. Works every time. I now have to beat him to the truck though other wise he charges me $20.00 for a ride home....   Art
