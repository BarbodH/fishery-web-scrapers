72192,setomonkey,2007-05-16 12:18:00,872,"Nice report, you are a lucky man to have a girlfriend who likes to fish and is game to hold pike or bowfin.  Mike"
70340,frozen-fire,2007-05-11 02:45:00,542,"So, after the awesome day out two days ago, my girlfriend and I decided to head back and try for some more. Decided not to go so early this time and head during the afternoon when the fish were more aggressive anyways. When we finally made it to the island, I was pretty surprised that there were sooo many people fishing. For some reason, I kinda felt that the fishing wasn't going to be as good. With people fishing on both sides of almost all the canals, felt like the pressure was up there.  We start casting with the same setup as the first time out, but this time with leaders. The black leaders really stood out, so I was worried that the fish would see this and not take or follow as readily. Was proven wrong though as after 15 minutes in, my gf gets a nice hit and brings the pike in. It however does a little flip before we're able to land it, shaking the lure off. Was a little guy, so it saved us the trouble.  A little while later, I soon get a hit and pull one in... nice way to start the day.    Couple casts later, another one! It was hooked very slightly, so I just brought it in and took the lure out with fish still in water.    It was really an awesome day weatherwise, which could possibly be the reason why so many people were out. Lots of cool wildlife to be seen as well. Lots of geese getting busy with the little ones.    And I thought that racoons living in tree trunks were just seen in cartoons or whatever...it was so cool hahaha.   I soon land another one. Biggest for me for the day at 27"" and 4 lbs.   After releasing the fish, my gf screams that she's got one on too, so I go and help her out.   She was on a role cause after like 2 minutes, shes' got something HUGE on... I could see that it fought like a monster. It was a while before the fish actually surfaced showing itself. Biggest one I have ever seen. BOWFIN!! 27"" and 6 lbs even. Such a cool prehistoric fish.     I land one more before we call it a day.    All in all, I would say that it was another great day and a cool unique fish as well!"
70342,irishfield,2007-05-11 02:48:00,26272,"Great stuff and she's a real keeper. Not many women...or even some of the ""men"" here for that matter.... will even touch a bow fin or a ling."
70343,huntervasili,2007-05-11 02:49:00,1604,Great report! looks like you had a worthwhile day on the water eh
70344,glirw,2007-05-11 02:49:00,200,Saweet !  Keep nailin' them man!
70346,frozen-fire,2007-05-11 02:51:00,542,"Oh yeah, she's a keeper hahaha."
70347,tbayboy,2007-05-11 02:53:00,1497,Wow thats one big bowfin.  Sounds like a perfect afternoon to me.
70349,Mike the Pike,2007-05-11 02:54:00,3421,Nice report great pics of the Ducks.nice shots of the snot rockets and Bowfin.  Enjoy your Shimano Stradic reel I apsolutely love it.Did it come with the Bob Izumi Rod and reel combo?  Keep up those great reports young man.  Oh and one more thing you should bring Urban Angler he seems to be a bit Rusty he needs lessons from a beginner like you.  WTG  MTP
70352,007,2007-05-11 02:55:00,537,Hey great report again.  Some really nice fish you got there.  That Bowfin is huge.  Your girlfriend certainly knows how to catch some good fish.  I wish I could get my wife to even hold a sunfish let alone something prehistoric like that! LOL  I wish I wasn't working and had time to be down at the islands every day.  Thanks for posting.  Cheers 007
70358,frozen-fire,2007-05-11 03:18:00,542, I got the stradic during BPS's spring sale event. Traded in a old reel and a got a sweet deal on it. Had to pay separate for the rod though. Shimano Compre...got a free hat at least
70360,frozen-fire,2007-05-11 03:22:00,542," I had to start her off with small panfish...then it went to lipping some big bass...now it's handling longer fish you can't lip... Funny thing though...she can handle the live fish no problem but totally freaked out and ran away when she snagged a HUGE dead carp. The thing must've weighed like 20lbs. I am unsure of it's cause of death...old age? Looked pretty fresh to me. She can't handle dead fish haha.  Gotta start making some dough soon, so not many more of these trips."
70365,Bassman27,2007-05-11 03:43:00,98,"That's awesome,you had a great day and great pics.Congrats  Bassman"
70372,xrap,2007-05-11 03:59:00,683,Nice report and fish dude. Pike opens this saturday for us   Loving the lures
70373,mikeymikey,2007-05-11 04:02:00,376,Oh that is just awesome (again) !!  Lucky to have a such cool (fishing) partner!  -------- What type/how did you work the lure?  -------  Oh and it must have been a lot of pike reports recently made a lot of people fish there
70375,xrap,2007-05-11 04:09:00,683,  The lure is a x-rap silver and black. You can fish it by retreiving it slowly or quickly or jerk it and make 2-3 seconds pauses.
70406,danbouck,2007-05-11 11:01:00,4380,makes me want to call in sick right now and go Pike fishing
70415,Steelcat,2007-05-11 11:35:00,191,"Judging from the clothings you guys wear in the picture, I think I saw you two landing a pike yesterday.  I think I was fishing too early yesterday, maybe I should go to the island in the afternoon like you instead of early morning.  Thanks for the report, makes me wanna try it out again."
70418,ccmtcanada,2007-05-11 11:39:00,7971,Wow!!! Another awesome report.  Some great looking Pike there....and that bonus bowfin....great job out there you two!  The pics are great...the weather was great...and the fishing was great....what else can you ask for?
70421,JEREMY,2007-05-11 11:44:00,300,Nice fish i really cant wait for tommorow now.I have a nice little spot just loaded with pike i hope it usually does. The only thing that would have made it a better day would have been gridlock playing on center island.
70444,mattyk,2007-05-11 12:40:00,2110,nice bowfin.
70477,Peps,2007-05-11 13:57:00,191,man o man i think i need to relocate my desk......you think the boss will notice?   great report!!!!!   Peps

70495,98Fahrenheit,2007-05-11 14:56:00,108,Good stuff bro!  You two heading out saturday for walleyes?

70547,jdmls,2007-05-11 17:22:00,575,"I really never considered fishing Lake O from shore until I have been seeing these posts lately. Good inspiration, plus maybe it will take a little pressure of the usual smaller lakes that get pounded on this time of year.  Keep it up my man"
