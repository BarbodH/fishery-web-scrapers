71914,fatherof3,2007-05-15 17:35:00,1769,Hey all. I am looking for somewhere to take the kids that will keep them busy. The rivers around Paris are really low with not much happening so needless to say the kids lose interest quickly. I was on the Brant conservation areas web site and it mentions fishing ponds with carp. I am not concerned with river access from here as you can just go to the other side and not have to pay a fee. If anyone has tried these ponds is it just carp or is there panfish. I just don't want to spend the money if it is not worth it. I just know if I don't get these kids onto any fish soon they could lose interest and I enjoy taking them out. Any help would be great and thanks in advance.

72265,mart,2007-05-16 15:51:00,93,I know there is a pond or oxbow near the back area of Brant Park near the river. I've never fished it though. I did see carp in there but not sure about panfish. I did notice lily pads in the pond so I'm sure there are other species in there.Maybe call the office and someone will have the answers for you.
