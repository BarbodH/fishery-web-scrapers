72109,eyefish,2007-05-16 01:48:00,135,Headed out to Rice for opener on Saturday with some buddies..fishing was ok not great but I have seen worse...we had 4 boats out there and managed 7 fish between us...all fish caught on crankbaits near drop offs. First picture is the biggest of the bunch..bout 3 lbs maybe.  Made it out to Scuggog last night after work with my brother..fishing was tuff but we did manage a couple fish...as a note to people who are planning on heading out in the future the walleye are still spawning...both of our fish came in water no deeper than 3 feet...Talked to a couple guys when we got off teh water and we were told that lots of guys are still getting them off their docks. Second picture is the big one from last night maybe 5-5.5lbs a nice fish for scuggog. Good luck all.  Todd

72216,Zib,2007-05-16 13:26:00,369,Nice walleyes. That first 1 sure is light.  I see you are like me when it comes to rods. You can never have enough fishing rods in the boat.
