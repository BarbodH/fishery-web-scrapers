72839,luv2drift,2007-05-18 01:14:00,147,I fished the mouth of a geogian bay river today and caught my first fish on a fly set up which was a rainbow.......AWESOME! never going back to spin casting!  In fact I caught six of them. All catch and released.  Anyway stupid question can you dunk your fly reel in the water while landing fish  if you have to or Does it matter if they see a little water.  I know centre pin reels it is a big no no.

72851,MJL,2007-05-18 02:01:00,2427,"In some form or another, my fly reels will eventually find their way into water (or mud) during the course of an average day of fishing.  Most reels nowadays are pretty much maintenance free...A quick rinse in the bathroom sink and a wipe down with a cloth is all I ever do after each trip."

72887,danbo,2007-05-18 04:47:00,2646,River silt & Grit gets into the bearings & causes jamming/grinding.
72888,FishFinder,2007-05-18 04:55:00,481,"ahh i thought you were talking about just regular water, seeing as islander has their reel underwater in their advertisements   main problem i have when i dunk mine is the backing absorbs alot of water making it a bit heavier."
