72870,Coach B,2007-05-18 03:12:00,18,I just got a call from my bro and instead of leaving for our Canada walleye trip this Sat we aren't leaving until Sunday!!! I've been ready for a month. My wife gave me crap just the other night since whenever we go on vacation I wait until that morning to pack but my bag is by the door and my gear is stacked in the garage ready to go! Good thing I spent too much on Mother's day.
