Anyways, we went out on Friday evening to see if there were any crappie or perch that wanted to visit our frying pan and we didn't get anything. Saturday morning we were out about 7:30 or so and hit several spots for walleye. I only saw one come up and decide he did not want my lure. Other than that, we caught a few perch, 1 crappie, and a half dozen OOS smallies. When we were getting ready to pack it in, what do I see coming up behind my Canadian Wiggler, a nice big FAT Kawartha muskie. 2 further casts and 2 more follows. I decided that was it, I did not want to take a chance at foul hooking him or hurting him. I figure I've got his number and I'll be back up there to catch him on or shortly after the opener. We did not bother to take any pics because what we caught wasn't worth it. I think that the cold front that came through shut the bite down. Hopefully we have better luck next time. BTW, fishing off of a 24ft pontoon boat is a very civilized way to fish. Lots of room to walk around, no getting in each other's way when casting and the like."
