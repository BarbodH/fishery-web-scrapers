70525,Patches,2007-05-11 16:25:00,48,"We were skunked on the walleye last night, so we switched to rock bass fishing and ended the night with 14lbs 4oz of the tastey spring rockies. "
70536,largemouth,2007-05-11 16:39:00,112,yummy!  good fighting fish for their size and even better tasting. Nicely done!
70538,Hooked,2007-05-11 16:48:00,891,"Nice job!  I have to say, Rock Bass maybe my favourite tasting fish."
70541,98Fahrenheit,2007-05-11 17:04:00,108,which area did you go to?
70544,Golfisher,2007-05-11 17:12:00,586,"How do the world's greatest sport fish taste compared to other fish?  More like walleye/perch, or closer to bass?  This may come handy when I get skunked on walleye opener next week."
70554,Patches,2007-05-11 17:39:00,48,Sarnia Bay was the Location (PM me for details).  And I think they taste like a cross between bluegill and crappie.
70557,GbayGiant,2007-05-11 17:47:00,1780,"Never tried them, don't know why, they probably taste good and hardly anyone keeps them, nice haul."
70564,turtle,2007-05-11 18:05:00,274,I find they are flaky like bass and tasty out of cold water.  I also find they hit anything but give up quick.
70646,pikehunter,2007-05-11 22:55:00,1659,"Caught a good one once while perch fishing, kept it and it went into the pan. Tasted OK. I figured why not try it? It's another panfish of a different colour that's all.  BTW, are you managing to keep the neighbourhood cat's, 'coons and skunks away from your patio with the lingering scent of fish on it?"
70662,Rizzo,2007-05-11 23:55:00,4754,nothin like a feed of rockers to start the season
71384,Patches,2007-05-14 14:25:00,48, I've got a 120lb Yellow Lab who does it for me.
71429,just2manylures,2007-05-14 17:41:00,144,I bet Rich is getting excited seeing those pics.  The Rock Bass King!
71486,misfish,2007-05-14 18:52:00,29133,"When we were kids camping we ate them all the time.Stringer of them along with a few smallies and a walleye or two.It,s all good."
71491,Headhunter,2007-05-14 18:58:00,5703,"I thought all Bass were flakes!   Cold water Rocketino's can be very good, if you can ever get the stench they give off, off of your hands! Been a long time since I ate one though... hmmmm... may not starve to death after all! HH"
71923,Patches,2007-05-15 17:58:00,48," The trick I use (for all fish) is rub your hands on stainless steel while the water is running.  Cabelas (and others) sell a stainless steel bar of soap that does the same thing.  Not sure the scientific process, but it works."
71937,misfish,2007-05-15 18:42:00,29133,"Those bars work great,even for getting the smell of gasoline off yer hands,or the scent of the mistress."
71938,ccmtcanada,2007-05-15 18:43:00,7971,"When I get home, I rub my hands on the stainless steel sink while washing...I'm just too cheap to go buy the bar....LOL."
71945,Headhunter,2007-05-15 19:03:00,5703,"Me to Cliff!  I believe it is also good for removing the smell of garlic from your hands. My wife thinks I have a thing for the kitchen faucet! Apparently, I'm rubbing it the wrong way! HH"
71947,Terry,2007-05-15 19:06:00,14456,ok this is going in a direction that disturbs me...lol
71948,ccmtcanada,2007-05-15 19:09:00,7971, LOL....(looking to the topic title....Rock Bass)....I think we are little off topic.  HH...I wash my hands and leave...no playing around at the sink for me....LOL.
71953,Golfisher,2007-05-15 19:31:00,586,"What do you know, you learn a new thing every day.  I gotta give this sink thing a try."
71954,Headhunter,2007-05-15 19:33:00,5703,"Yah, yah... Rock Bass... that's the ticket! HH"
72195,setomonkey,2007-05-16 12:41:00,872,I had no idea the world's greatest sport fish (WGSF) was a tasty treat too.  Mike
