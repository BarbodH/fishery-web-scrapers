72657,kayak fisher,2007-05-17 16:05:00,66,"Hey everyone, I am just gearing up for the long weekend!!  I am going up to Wadsworth lake, just south of Bancroft and I was wondering if anyone could provide me with some advice.  I am unsure of what division the lake is in (MNR inaccurate maps) so could anyone tell me what is in season there?  I believe there are whitefish and lakers in there, and they should be in season.  We will be fishing out of kayaks.  Any advice on how to catch these at this time of year?  Thanks!  I hope that everyone has a chance to get out this weekend."

72725,kayak fisher,2007-05-17 19:30:00,66,Thanks for the link!   it appears that lake trout and whitefish are open.  Can anybody provide any details as to how I might be able to catch them at this time of year?  I usually only ice fish for these species.  Any help is greatly appreciated....Thanks again.
