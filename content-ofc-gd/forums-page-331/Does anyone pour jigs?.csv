Since I couldn't find any online I tried to hire someone to pour them for me, it has been over a month and they still aren't ready so I'm looking for other options. If anyone is interested I need jigs (any style i can tie on, preferred minnow head) in sizes 1/8, 1/4, and 3/8 oz, I need them by next week, pm me for details.  Thanks, Christopher"
