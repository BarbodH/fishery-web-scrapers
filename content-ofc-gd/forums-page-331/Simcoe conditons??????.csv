766522,wallacio,2013-02-09 20:45:00,475,"The ice is in great shape in deep water areas...about 8-9"", no slush except near pressure cracks.  The snow is incredibly deep though, we saw multiple ATVs stuck and people on foot weren't getting far before they were exhausted.  With warm temperatures on tap over the next two days, it'll be a real mess out there."
766524,davey buoy,2013-02-09 20:56:00,5505,"Talking to a couple fellows who were out from Johnsons Beach.Snow fluffy,ice great,they just followed a couple packed down trails out."
766525,Terry,2013-02-09 20:57:00,14456,on the way back in I saw some slush where sleds had gone by  water comes up out of every hole I drilled so there will be lots more slush tomorrow  but tons of ice out there
766527,misfish,2013-02-09 21:10:00,29133," If Joey was out there,there must be.How were the bugs? LOL  Thanks for the posts ."
766528,Terry,2013-02-09 21:14:00,14456,they don't bug as much if you keep the top up and keep moving   lol
766548,LefroyFisherman,2013-02-09 22:33:00,602,"I was out on the sled at the 5th line, about 8 inches of ice, lots of snow, I wouldnt be out there on a 4wheeler."
766568,BillM,2013-02-10 00:05:00,17367,"I had to laugh at some of the ATV's I saw out there today.  Drive 10ft, get stuck..... drive another 10ft get stuck..."
766598,Joey,2013-02-10 01:33:00,9122," Yup, enough ice for me out there now  Yup, tons of snow.  Walking did not look pleasant!!  Snowmobiling was slow due to wavy mounds of snow, but not bad.  We played safe today and stayed away from known pressure cracks.  Was a beauty day to be out in that sunshine."
766600,BillM,2013-02-10 01:36:00,17367,"Yup, really nice out there when the wind died down and the sun came out!"
766603,ckrb2007,2013-02-10 01:47:00,449,"I was out off of the Gov. Dock at BBP..on my ATV. Made it out to my waypoint about 1.2km out, got stuck a couple times crossing drifts. 8"" of awesome ice. Went 4/6 on the lakers and 1/1 on whities. Had a blast out there. Report to follow."
766608,dheitzner,2013-02-10 02:00:00,314,"10-12"" off the west side side of Thorah, and tons of snow.  Felt like I was riding a seadoo on the way out this morning with all the drifts!!!"
766652,woodro,2013-02-10 06:07:00,168,"Fished kemp today near BBP. 103FOW. Marked about 15-20 fish throughout the morning and 4 large clouds of baitfish....SKUNKED! Tried everything in the box from, bad boys, white tubes, swim baits, Williams whitefish, jiggin raps in a variety of sizes and nothing.  fish were interested but but couldn't get them to bite.  What should I do when I see fish on the graph?  The ice was solid about 8-10"". Snow was deep so a pair of snowshoes helped for the walk out.  There were also a Bunch of machines on the ice."

766654,woodro,2013-02-10 06:12:00,168,"Hey ckrb2007, What did you do to get them to bite?"
766662,wallacio,2013-02-10 11:32:00,475," When you see fish on your screen, suspend your bait just above them.   If one is interested and starts to rise for it to investigate start reeling away fairly quickly and don't stop until it hits or breaks off the chase.    Some fish will follow for 20, 30 or even 40' before hitting.  If a fish breaks off a chase you can often get another shot at it by dropping your bait down again to where the fish is and see if you can get it to chase again.  Some days fish just aren't all that interested and few will give chase and even fewer will actually hit (yesterday seemed to be one of those for most)."
766665,woodro,2013-02-10 12:21:00,168,Thanks wallico!! I'll try it out and let you know how I did.
