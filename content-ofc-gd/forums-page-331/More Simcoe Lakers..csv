766209,BillM,2013-02-08 15:35:00,17367,"Decided to call in a personal day at work and chase a few greasy lakers around on Simcoe Wednesday..  Thanks to procreation, my partner in crime Davey hasn't been able to get out much.  However the stars aligned and Wednesday was the day!  Davey definitely had the hot hand today, I dunno how many he iced, but it was more then me!        We also both got into PB's...  There are some absolute COWS in this lake!      Notice the fin clip on this beast, didn't put it on the scale, but calling it 15lbs wouldn't be pushing it    Super thick!      Always a fun time Davey!   We'll be back at it in no time!"
766213,wallacio,2013-02-08 15:38:00,475,"""Thanks to procreation, my partner in crime Davey hasn't been able to get out much.""   LMAO!   Ain't that the truth!   I'll be taking care of that soon...snip!  Yipes!  That was honestly the most fun I've had in a while, it's always great to get out with you bud!   Thanks again for going through the trouble of grabbing your sled, it was definitely key to getting on the fish that day!"

766218,davey buoy,2013-02-08 15:51:00,5505,There some nice fish guys!!!!thanks for sharing!!!
766219,farsider,2013-02-08 15:52:00,456,"Nice!  Thanks for posting.  I hope they don't release the hounds on the amazing Herring forage just yet.  It is no accident Lakers are doing so well.  The success of all Simcoe predators in no small part depends on them.  Cheers, Mark"
766223,BillM,2013-02-08 16:02:00,17367, Lots and lots of bait out there.   We both had our graphs go crazy more then a few times because of giant schools of the things!   Now if we could only find the whitefish (Which seem to have disappeared apparently)
766232,Joey,2013-02-08 16:31:00,9122,"Wow great stuff guys, you did well"

766247,4x4bassin,2013-02-08 16:58:00,1025,"Great day guys , I can't believe the size of some of these lake trout people are pulling out of Simcoe this year . Like you said some real ""cows""  Simcoe is turning the corner and becoming a world class lake trout lake"

766262,Rod Caster,2013-02-08 18:01:00,5784,"Damn, that was gonna be my comment haha.  Great show out there Bill and Dave."
766269,kickingfrog,2013-02-08 18:14:00,8333,I got out after lunch on Wednesday for a few hours and didn't have one solid hook-up. Marked a bunch at 110 fow but couldn't get them to chase more then 10 feet or so.  Didn't mark much at 90-105 ft. Beautiful day though.
766270,WeedLine,2013-02-08 18:16:00,322,Nice job on the PBs. I got out  last week and the week before with friends and did quite well too.  Looks like you guys had some nice weather to be out. Great report Bill
766293,ecmilley,2013-02-08 19:34:00,2163,was up this morning to head out seen all the nice fluffy snow and decided to not find a pressure crack the hard way. wtg on pb and a stellar day on the hard water
