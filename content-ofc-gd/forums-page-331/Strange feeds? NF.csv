End result I made a za chucked full of ground venison sausage, mushrooms, sundried tomatoes, calabresee salami, and a ridiculous amount of mozzerella cheese. Wow....that was a good plan. It just came to me that I have never had pizza with venison? Any other creations out there that are not really the norm but come from the water or land??  "
766624,BillM,2013-02-10 02:44:00,17367,I would eat that.
766634,Nipfisher,2013-02-10 03:06:00,2449,Unopened beer? Yuck!  Pizza looks great.
766635,Christopheraaron,2013-02-10 03:07:00,3525,Theres a place in burlington that makes poutine with duck meat and foie gras (duck liver) wow that is good!
766642,irishfield,2013-02-10 03:31:00,26272,I hope it tasted better than the beer!! A nice Boddington's Pub Draft would have gone nicely with that....

I've made more than 25,000 pies for sure .( some of the best you'd ever have) I had a manager in BC "" Pizza Factory "" come to me one day and said "" put this on a pie "" He had handed me a sliced loaf of some sort , I chopped it up and added it to an ""all meat"" pie . ( Butcher can attest to this ) ... There was enough for me to make a free take home pie , so I added veggies and ginger , made my way home and we ate it ... Next day I ( we ) find out from Atwal that we had eaten DOG ! ( Akbash Hound ) ..  Hmm , quite tasty ... never again ..  Making pizza is an artform ... my favorite is a Rye crust , painted with EV Olive Oil , Ginger, Garlic , Mozza/ Feta (base)  cheddar on top , 4 kinds of peppers , 3 different onions , shrooms, pineapple , olives , ham + bacon +capa, red sauce as a dipper .  Ran the Pizza Man ."
