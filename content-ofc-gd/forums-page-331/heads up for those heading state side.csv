Then I was at Rochester Gander mountain store. on Jan 15, 2013, I almost bought the  $40 long 10' steelehead/salmon rod rated up to 17lb, a good deal which I did not buy since I already have lots of long rods, then no other deals worth buying. Prices are not as good as it used to be.  The US stores are controlling their inventory as we speak, especially with all the other US stores closing report. however, once they have real sale during spring, rods and reel can be price better than most Canadian stores. Their online stores are also killing their own retail outlet. Retailing is getting tougher every year."
