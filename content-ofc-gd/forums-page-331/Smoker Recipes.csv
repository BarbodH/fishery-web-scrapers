766024,BruceCfisher86,2013-02-07 20:14:00,49,"I just remembered this one, Its not for the smoker tho!  Lake Erie Monster  Texas Toast PineRiver medium cheddar Pickeral fillets(1/4pound) Mayo Fresh Jalapeno or Relish or Both Pepper. Butter  This is good for 2 sangys  Batter Pickeral and pan fry in oil/or deep fry. Darryl Cronzys batter is sweet! Butter TexasToast as you would to prepare a grilled cheese Prepare a tartar sauce with Mayo and Relish , Pepper and lemon juice . I replaced relish with a Jalapeno because I dislike relish, and it adds a bit of zip to the sandwhich. You can add both together. Preheat Oven at 350F / place buttered TexasToast on a baking sheet. Put 2 pieces of cheese on each slice, put 1 fillet on 2 slices Cook for 3 - 5 mins / Remove from oven and put it together. Serve with the tartar sauce you made, and your good.  I found this in a Field&Stream mag so yes, there were a few more things it called for in this recipe, and correct measurements but I have sinced lost the article and have just winged it a few times, and it turns out great. I'm sure you could add whatever for flavour."

This was my ""livleyhood"" for many years (educated in the trade, grad of Vancouver Community College) i still butcher / cure and smoke meat at home  i would not recommend using Nitrites unless you have an understanding if how they work and the advantages / dangers"

766094,Freshtrax,2013-02-08 00:17:00,2215,"My fav.  Beef rub.   Brisket , roast beef ribs  Rub meat with a quality Dijon mustard get a nice 1/4 inch coating on there.  Then add the rub.  1/2 cup salt 1/2 cup brown sugar 1/4 cup pepper Paprika 3 tablespoons Onion powder 3 tablespoons Garlic powder 2 tablespoons Chillie powder 2 tablespoons   Work it in good and let sit for 24 four hours in fridge. Bring beat to room temperature before smoking.   Roasts I cook to med rare in middle,  brisket and ribs it is important to take to 205 degrees to melt all the connective tissue. I smoke at no more than 250 degrees  While I'm smoking I baste every half hour or so with apple juice , red wine, shallots , mixture that was brought to a boil on stove and let cool.   I also usually put a bakin tin full of applejuiceninnthe smoker to keep the humidity up."

766794,Ice Fishing Ham,2013-02-10 23:14:00,83,"This is a recipe I use it was copied from this guy in the You-Tube video.   The fillets were dry brined (rub) in a mixture of 2 parts kosher salt to 1 part dark brown sugar for about 3 hours. Then rinsed and dried, then left uncovered over night in the fridge to dry further.They were smoked for 5 hours at a starting temperature of 150 and increased to 165 for the last hour. Hickory was used for the smoke wood.The results were great. The guys at work loved it. One of the best comments was from a fellow worker who grew up on the Rock, who said he really liked it and he liked the different texture dry brining made.  Start   Halfway   All done   "
