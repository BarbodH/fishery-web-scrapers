I know that I can probably dig the info out of google or some of the specialied shops but it'd be really nice to know what you guys think.Right now, my main unit is a Lowrance LCX 25C, It works well and I'm happy with it. At the bow I have an old Lowrance X-85. The X-85 has been gold to me for many  many years...very clear and accurate readings at all times.I would like  to have a unit to be able to connect to the LCX 25C. First of all I'd like to know if communication would be possible between the 25C and an HDS unit. If so... which would I be better off with as the 'slave' unit? The 25C is hefty..8000 watts. Any thoughts before I start digging. It'd be good if I could get this done for this softwater season.Thanks"

Here's a pretty good thread I found on another forum,  might wanna take a look.  http://www.bbcboards.net/lowrance-garmin-sonar-gps/175559-lowrance-networking-101-a.html"
