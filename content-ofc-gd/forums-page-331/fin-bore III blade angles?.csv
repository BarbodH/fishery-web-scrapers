765733,EC1,2013-02-06 16:50:00,930,"I found that when I replaced the blades, the auger goes back to normal, so I'm no help here.  If I was to lend my auger again, I'm gonna get the guy to drill me a hole right next to me so I know they know how to use it before I lend it to them. Sucks when your auger is destroyed before the end of the day and you can't move anymore."
765755,Jet,2013-02-06 18:05:00,364,Definitely sounds like something is bent out of angle as you shouldn't have to shim the blades at all.  Perhaps you can compare your auger to a good one and see where it might be bent and try adjusting it from there.
