759735,fishnsled,2013-01-16 17:39:00,3520,"Wax on...Wax off...Nice work guys!  Say hi to Brook for me, looks like that dog is learning some new tricks."
759743,mercman,2013-01-16 18:16:00,7054,"He posted that on my FB Group, and i said to myself ""Wow !!!! Thats as nice as a Spiel creation !!"" Then he told me you were teaching him   Good on you both. Chris is obviously a fast learner"
759748,John,2013-01-16 18:26:00,2956,Way too many Chris's on this board if you ask me........   Looks like a good one in the making guys...
759804,Live2fish85,2013-01-16 23:16:00,1633,"Thanks guys. I got one hell of a teacher, couldn't be better.  Thanks Chris"
759806,Christopheraaron,2013-01-16 23:23:00,3525,Can't wait to see this thing in person!
765449,Spiel,2013-02-05 17:26:00,9065,"Well Live2fish85 (Chris) came by yesterday afternoon to apply the final coat of finish to his rod and it's now done.  A job well done I must say for a first ever go at it. He hasn't seen the end results yet, well he has if he's reading this.  I've no doubt he's itching to get out and break it in.  Here you go Chris, congratulations, it has been fun.   "
765456,mercman,2013-02-05 17:44:00,7054,"Really awesome work guys !!! How does it feel to have a protege, Spiel? Looks like he is well on his way to carrying the torch !!!"
765463,kemper,2013-02-05 18:06:00,2232,Lookin excellent gents
765479,Live2fish85,2013-02-05 19:24:00,1633,"Man oh man I am itching to get out with that.  Chris I can't thank you enough, really appreciate the time you have taken to teach/guide me on my first build. Will cherish this rod for ever as it is my first and was taught by a master.  I am already talking to my grandfather about building my own piece similar to the one you have Chris, for building them that is.  Again, thanks Chris. I had a blast building this rod, never would it have looked half as good as it does without your help. Hanging out with you wasn't all that bad either haha. You are are blast to hang out with Chris, made building it that much more enjoyable and easy. Thanks for letting me use your shop as well.  Now you will have to fish it with me on the river. That is once you get some free time from all the builds you have on your hands.   Thanks all. I can honestly say that if you are looking at getting a new rod talk to Chris. The man is amazing when it comes to building rods. Don't think I will ever buy another store rod."
765497,aplumma,2013-02-05 20:16:00,6896,"Welcome to the club I am not even tempted by my buddies Gloomis rods any more. I think he is finding that my rods are very nice also he seems to get ""confused"" and picking up my rods when we are fishing in the same boat.   Art"
765523,I'mHooked,2013-02-05 21:52:00,525,"Awsome looking rod guys, way to go!"
765528,misfish,2013-02-05 21:55:00,29133,Nice finished rod Chris & Chris.

765674,lew,2013-02-06 08:15:00,12766,"Beautiful work guys, very nicely done !!"
765727,Ron,2013-02-06 16:41:00,1683,"Very impressive. I have no doubt in my mind that Chris would be an outstanding teacher on such a fine art.  Cheers, Ron..."
765737,fishindevil,2013-02-06 17:06:00,6254,looks awesome guys !!! wow....
765866,Live2fish85,2013-02-07 01:03:00,1633,"Thanks guys, appreciate it."
765926,spinnerdoc,2013-02-07 10:24:00,556,"Way to go Chris's, I think I was at Chris's house on the first day on Chris's build, I arrived after Chris left Chris's house  I love the rod my friend, LTF85 has got some skills  , and good on you Spiel for guiding him"
759157,Spiel,2013-01-14 19:22:00,9065,"I was asked by Live2fish85 (Chris) if I would help/guide him through his first rod build. Naturally I said ""for sure,"" but for convenience I suggested he come here and use my shop, my tools and my guidance rather than do it via PM's as he lives near by.  So after discussing what it was he wanted I ordered in the needed components and once all was here we arranged some convenient time for both of us to get together and begin the build. We're two days into it at this point. Chris has glued up the cork rings for the handle, wound on some guides and also shaped the handle and fitted it to the blank for gluing. I did the gluing of the handle to the blank in his absence but it is at this point it's all I have done outside of offering guidance.  I think he's done amazing!  Here's a few pictures of where it's all at to date  "
759162,Christopheraaron,2013-01-14 19:38:00,3525,Nice job guys!
759163,Live2fish85,2013-01-14 19:45:00,1633,Thank you so much Chris. I was dying to get a good picture.  Damn I love that so much haha.
759164,davey buoy,2013-01-14 19:49:00,5505,There's a lot pride I'm sure.Nothing like building something yourself  .Looks good.
759165,Canuck2fan,2013-01-14 19:55:00,1444,To my amateur eyes not only is it fabulous looking but since it is a Michigan handle it will extremely functional as well!!! Can't wait to see more.
759167,Ralph Field,2013-01-14 20:11:00,1018,"Looks great ,  and real nice of Chris to use his talents to help a fellow angler."
759187,misfish,2013-01-14 21:15:00,29133,"Thats a sweet handle. Whats that middle section?   Nice of of you Chris to offer up. Are you passing on the trade,as retirement is in your future?"
759188,I'mHooked,2013-01-14 21:22:00,525,Good job Chris^2 ! Nice looking handle guys.
759191,esoxansteel,2013-01-14 21:35:00,1307,"Looks like another master-piece in the making, with the guru of rod builders as the mentor,"
759192,aplumma,2013-01-14 21:40:00,6896,Chris and Chris good job I think you got an understudy.    Art
759296,spincast,2013-01-15 00:33:00,3279,. I was talking to Live2fish on the weekend - he was pretty pumped about this build - I understand why - nice work guys.
759353,Live2fish85,2013-01-15 02:36:00,1633,Thanks all. Appreciate it.
759355,Christopheraaron,2013-01-15 02:39:00,3525,"is it a float or a spey? Either way, again good work!"
759358,Live2fish85,2013-01-15 02:49:00,1633,Float
759359,NAW,2013-01-15 02:56:00,4022,"I'm assuming you are going to keep us posted with updates?  This is going to be a great thread guys!!  I'm gunna test out this ""follow this topic"" feature.  Rods looking great so far."
759362,Live2fish85,2013-01-15 03:02:00,1633,I will post some pictures of it finished if Chris doesn't. Hopefully some fish in them as well.
759365,NAW,2013-01-15 03:03:00,4022,NICE!
759408,Fish Farmer,2013-01-15 11:39:00,2234,"Looks great guys, can I come over and watch you build me another rod, I need more training"

759450,Spiel,2013-01-15 15:07:00,9065,"Thanks guys.      There's and expression I believe, something about old dogs and new tricks......."
759452,Jigs,2013-01-15 15:20:00,136,A teacher I had back in high school built rods and offered to build one with me once. It really helped solidify my passion for the sport. Seeing this brings back memories and makes me appreciate what he did. I have that rod still too.
759506,Skipper D,2013-01-15 19:19:00,1970,"yes , and then theres that one old dog you know , you can see some thing in him but you just can't put your finger on it ....... lol ."
759529,aplumma,2013-01-15 20:28:00,6896,I remember the first 4 Rod's Chris built for me all noble tools at a great price. The 5th one I offered to help and the price doubled. go figure. lol   Art
