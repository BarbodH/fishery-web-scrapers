766084,walleye wanderer,2013-02-07 23:53:00,64,What website do you use to store/link photos for your posts?  Cheers WW
766085,jedimaster,2013-02-07 23:54:00,3472,"Photobucket.com works well and is very reliable, has apps for android and iphone and is free. No real need to use anything else. There are other but why bother."
766090,pidge,2013-02-08 00:07:00,438,"What Jedimaster said. I suck at computers, but can figure out photobucket."
766092,Joey,2013-02-08 00:13:00,9122,I use Flickr and like it alot!
766097,Christopheraaron,2013-02-08 00:30:00,3525,"Photobucket is good, but be careful what you upload. They have the rights to the photos once you upload"
766105,Locnar,2013-02-08 00:45:00,645,"www.imgur.com ... it's also a website that shows the ""best"" viral photos collected from a variety of sites. Your images are personal and will not be shown on their ""front page"" unless you want them to be."
766113,BillM,2013-02-08 01:22:00,17367," Yup, great new layout and very easy for the non tech savvy kind of person."
766200,hammercarp,2013-02-08 15:14:00,964,Photobucket.
766203,shane,2013-02-08 15:23:00,652,All the 'cool' people use Flickr.
766206,BillM,2013-02-08 15:27:00,17367," Flickr is great, but it's more for photo enthusiasts rather then guys that just want to hotlink pics..."
766229,BillM,2013-02-08 16:15:00,17367," LOL!!   Flickr pulls the EXIF data depending on your account settings.  It also doesn't destroy the quality of the pic like Photobucket does.   If I want to edit/share a good pic, I'll edit in CS6 then link it from Flickr.   If I really don't care about the quality, Photobucket it is..."
766380,walleye wanderer,2013-02-08 23:32:00,64,"Excellent point Bill, I didn't realize that Flickr provided better qualityâ€¦thanks."
