They are pretty soft when dethawed so it is helpful to use a quick strike rig to make sure they don't rip a piece off.  Pike will hit amazingly large baits.  Routinely catch 20-24"" pike on 7 to 8"" sardines.  I want to try a big mackerel and see what happens.....  Burt"

Fire up the Q and while they're on there have the Mrs(if applicable) uncork a bottle of white wine and break out some olives, Asiago cheese and crusty bread.  Enjoy."
