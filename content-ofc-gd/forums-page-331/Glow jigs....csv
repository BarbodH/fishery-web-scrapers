765602,TJQ,2013-02-06 01:04:00,7806,"So with my new found interest in all things tackle related.. I have the opportunity to get some of these...Â  I've seen glow jigs before but nothing like this.. they come with super glow plastics too..  Where would you use them, my first thought was for trout, in the deep dark.. Think they would work??  These look like they came from a nuclear plant....  <object width=""420"" height=""315""><param name=""movie"" value=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbYvqaBrRhg?version=3&hl=en_US&rel=0""></param><param'>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbYvqaBrRhg?version=3&hl=en_US&rel=0""></param><param name=""allowFullScreen"" value=""true""></param><param name=""allowscriptaccess"" value=""always""></param><embed src=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbYvqaBrRhg?version=3&hl=en_US&rel=0"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" width=""420"" height=""315"" allowscriptaccess=""always"" allowfullscreen=""true""></embed></object>"
765604,Handlebarz,2013-02-06 01:09:00,3790,I used then for walleye with a twister tail. At night they seemed to make a difference I would use black tails.
765614,dhickey,2013-02-06 01:38:00,1038,Yep..  I checked out your site rather quickly yesterday and it just occured to me that I didnt see any flies or streamers?  You might want to check that out seing as the river season is fast aproaching? Just a thought.  Good luck and all the best  Don.

765640,DRIFTER_016,2013-02-06 03:23:00,10439,Glow jigs and plastics as well as glow tubes are kick donkey fer lakers and burbot. And yes I would use them.
765672,discophish,2013-02-06 06:13:00,392,Shhh!!  You're giving up the secret!!!  Charge them at night with a camera flash.  They would be even better with some googly eyes that rattle.
765696,manitoubass2,2013-02-06 14:15:00,11391,"I use glow jigs for almost all my ice fishing, while jigging of course. Not too much light penetration down there, even during the day. These one look pretty good TJ! I'd buy them if they are available in packs of at least 25"
765697,TJQ,2013-02-06 14:18:00,7806, Would you use them with no plastic tail  or with a plastic tail.
765728,kemper,2013-02-06 16:42:00,2232,I've always been a fan of using glow jigs (ice fishing size) for crappies at night in the softwater season.
765731,ecmilley,2013-02-06 16:46:00,2163,"they look great TJ use lots of glow through the ice tipped with just a minnow, in softwater with a 3""grub is deadly on evning weedlines"
765848,manitoubass2,2013-02-07 00:09:00,11391,"I would def. use them with grubs. I love using salted grubs. But I would also use them tipped with a crawler or live minnow, or even Gulp minnows.  But yeah, I still use salted grubs most the time, 2.5-4"""
765928,Rich,2013-02-07 11:19:00,3927,I would use them with whatever the situation required i tip them with...
