Weather's been so schizo this year: cold, mild, melting, cold, etc etc. now this stuff. thank god our mayor hasn't called in the forces yet lol. guess we're lucky it fell on a friday so most can leave the heavy lifting till saturday.  I'll be happy if there's this much in Algonquin if I head up for the family day long one."
766376,NAW,2013-02-08 23:14:00,4022,"Just got in for a good rip on the bravo!  With what we had before, and now this!  What a workout.  Tons of powder to play in!  Packing down the neighbours trails to they can cross country ski."
766377,jedimaster,2013-02-08 23:21:00,3472,"Well being in Toronto, I pushed 4 people that were stuck on my way to work and 3 on my way home... The best was a girl in a bmw with summer tires. I told her when she gets going don't let off the gas just keep it going and she can make it. Well I pushed and got her going and she was chugging up the hill. I got back in the jeep and passed her right as she got stuck again. I couldn't help but smile and wave as I drove by her. She was probably better off stuck in a snow bank anyway"
766384,Acountdeleted,2013-02-08 23:47:00,2562,"Debating if I should go to work or not. All season tires but our road still isn't plowed yet. I do like money but I also like my life, and going into the bar for what could be 2 customers isn't worth it."
766386,mr blizzard,2013-02-09 00:01:00,1589,"Glad to see you guys are getting some winter weather finally. enjoy some sledding,  For those of you who had traded in your snowblowers for a set of golf clubs, Buffalo Joe will fly a plane full  of Toros down but he can be pricey"
