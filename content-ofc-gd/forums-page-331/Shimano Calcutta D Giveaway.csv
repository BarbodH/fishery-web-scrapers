Today is a snow day for many of us up north so I figured why not spread a little warmth with The Snow Day Calcutta D Give Away (pretty cool name huh, I came up with that myself). If you want to win this bad boy just post a warm weather fishing picture here on Dave Mercer's Facts of Fishing to make us all feel a tiny bit warmer & 1 winner will be picked Monday morning! Hey, if you have not liked the Shimano Facebook page yet do it so the big wigs keep giving use cool prizes like this!""  "
