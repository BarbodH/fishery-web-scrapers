765910,dhickey,2013-02-07 03:53:00,1038,If I take a child under 16 fishing does that mean that Im alowed to have twice the amount of bait?  Saltydawg.
765912,Muskieman,2013-02-07 04:15:00,2472,In 2 different buckets .. but what are ya gonna do with 20 dozen minnows ?
765917,dhickey,2013-02-07 04:53:00,1038,Just wondering because I went through 2 scoops of minnows in 4 hours last saturday.
765919,Woodsman,2013-02-07 05:01:00,1286, Where do you find the requirement for 2 buckets?
765927,Rich,2013-02-07 11:17:00,3927,Two scoops is about 30-40 minnows.. in 4 hours?  So are you fishing for 24 hrs straight?
765929,Terry,2013-02-07 11:23:00,14456,the answer is ....no...you are not allowed extra  you are allowed the same number of bait as always and the child is allowed the their full count of bait  but you are not allowed extra and if the MNR sat and watched and saw you use 120 then  start taking from the childs minnows you could be charged  would never happen but........it is the law
765995,Woodsman,2013-02-07 17:28:00,1286,This is actually incorrect. There is no daily limit on minnows used only a possession limit of 120. Once they are used and gone (no longer in your possession) you can replenish your supply as many times as needed as long as you don't have more than 120 in possession at any given time.

766035,moxie,2013-02-07 20:54:00,1566,Rules and Regs only apply if you  follow them or don't and get caught.
766046,Muskieman,2013-02-07 21:50:00,2472,"didn't come out right , blame it on beer and a french accent , possesion limit is 10 dozen per angler , 2 anglers 2 buckets, right ?"
766088,Freshtrax,2013-02-07 23:59:00,2215, Bait guy must not like you.   My scoops are 50ish each
766162,Woodsman,2013-02-08 05:17:00,1286,I know of no requirement for anglers to have separate buckets. As far as I know if two anglers are fishing together they can have their minnows in the same bucket as long as they do not exceed the total amount they are allowed. Not the same as catch & possession limits for fish where each angler can only catch their own limit and can not help out the other angler on their limit.
766228,chris f.,2013-02-08 16:13:00,95,"must be separate buckets to make it ""easier"" for mnr to count and verify that you have the right amount and type of bait. i thought it was stupid too but..."
766401,dhickey,2013-02-09 01:17:00,1038,Thanks guys  I will keep this in mind.  But 2 buckets what a pain in the buttttt.
766407,BillM,2013-02-09 01:49:00,17367,"1 bucket, 2 separate minnow bags..."
