765626,chris f.,2013-02-06 02:24:00,95,"hey there guys.. i found my dads old jiffy under the cottage while i was up there last month. it had been under there for like 10-15 years, but he left some oil in the tank and the plug is clean. i want to get her running before the end of the season, but i don't want to wreck it. it still looks like it was just bought. any tips would be appreciated... i'm good with engine and carb work, but never worked on an auger.. thanks in advance, cheers"
765628,Joeytier,2013-02-06 02:39:00,3990,Fix it up and sell it!  Never liked Jiffy's...used a few of them now [all well maintained] and all of them were moody starters no matter what.
765638,irishfield,2013-02-06 03:19:00,26272,Mix some fresh 24:1 and give it a pull... then go cut holes in the ice!
765652,NAW,2013-02-06 04:18:00,4022,"If your good at carbc, then you should be good for any motor issues.  How does the blade look?  Motor may run good but if the blade is rusted bad, or is dull, it won't cut well.  Saw two guys both leaning hard on one gas augar on the weekend.  That's what it took to make it cut ice.  Either dull, or the in incorrect angle on the blade(s).  They can make it a real pain in the but."
765720,Freshtrax,2013-02-06 16:06:00,2215,"Clean the carbs good, put some fresh gas in it, and pull a way.     Not sure what the fuel pumps are on those but if it has a diaphragm it may be dried out and cracked."
765722,jedimaster,2013-02-06 16:23:00,3472,"I would pull the plug, clean carb, and soak it inside the cylinder with some deep creep or sea foam or something like that, let it sit, then pull the starter cord slowly make sure it gets fully lubbed up before firing it up. The rings will likely be seized to some degree and likely a fair bit of rust inside if it sat for that long.  No big rush to get it fired up so just  go easy on her and she will treat you well for a long time,"
765724,mikdor,2013-02-06 16:28:00,109,"If it were me I would go buy a carb kit and put it in and check to see if the gas lines are cracked, if the engine is not ceased You should be good to go. Good Luck Mike"
765726,ecmilley,2013-02-06 16:36:00,2163,"I agree with wayne, start with the simple will it run then fix it"
765730,Tybo,2013-02-06 16:45:00,1373,"Yep,Some fresh ready-mix and fire it up."
766149,waki5,2013-02-08 03:51:00,34,i agree with irishfield. mix some super 24:1 and start it up. today i started mine after 2 years of sitting. all i did was pour out the old fuel and put in the new. pulled the cord twice. primed till i could hear the fuel going in and on the third pull it started. i did this at 5pm and  plan on fishing in the morning. Thats what i think about my Jiffy. Never fails me. All i hope now is that i can find the fish tomorrow
766179,chris f.,2013-02-08 13:08:00,95,"lol... thanks guys, cleaned the tank, mixed new fuel, cleaned the plug, and primed her... 2 pulls and purrrr purrrr. they built thing better back in the day lol, i'll never get rid of this jiffy. thanks again for the help guys"
766188,wallyboss,2013-02-08 13:54:00,1095,Run a bit of Seafoam thru it and it'll take care of any residue left by the old gas.
766192,WeedLine,2013-02-08 14:28:00,322,"Hey guys, my Jiffy says to run the mix 40:1.    It's a model 30. Should I be mixing it 24:1?"
766193,BillM,2013-02-08 14:32:00,17367, Go by what the sticker says.
