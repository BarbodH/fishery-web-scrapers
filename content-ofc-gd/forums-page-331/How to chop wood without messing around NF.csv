766471,bdox,2013-02-09 14:45:00,329,Lots of talk of home heating and wood vs other methods on the board recently. Came across this video this morning and thought some might appreciate it.  
766472,davey buoy,2013-02-09 14:47:00,5505,Now that's the way to do it!!!!!!!!!!
766473,Christopheraaron,2013-02-09 14:53:00,3525,Great idea!
766484,nancur373,2013-02-09 16:13:00,1211,Providing you have a straight grain wood. Also out in the cold helps a lot too. But........this is the way to go... 
766486,misfish,2013-02-09 16:43:00,29133,That takes all the fun out of it.LOL  That is awesome.
766502,bigugli,2013-02-09 18:51:00,6138,I dunno?  I kinda miss swinging my 15lb maul and sending chunks of wood flying through the air. Got lots of peace and quiet that way as no one would come within 20'

766516,misfish,2013-02-09 20:33:00,29133,"Nothing like cutting and splitting,,to get an ole dog, buffed up there Lew."
766518,moemoe,2013-02-09 20:40:00,352,"just split 10 chord, that would have helped!"
766520,lew,2013-02-09 20:43:00,12766, And my wood supplier is buffed up very nicely Brian
