765739,mike rousseau,2013-02-06 17:20:00,4661,"Lol  This brings up a funny story...  When I was younger nature made its call.... So I hunkered down between a couple old boathouses... Grabbed some leafs... All is  good right? WRONG...lol ... My brother showed up a minute after I finished.... Then he looked in the water and said he saw a big crayfish....lol... I insisted it was no crayfish without saying it was my poop out of embarrassment.... Sure enough I couldn't tell him any different.,. And he was keen on catching this ""crayfish"".... Anyone who's ever caught crayfish knows you gotta grab em fairly hard.... In the end he almost puked once he squeezed the handful of waste....and I blamed a turtle until many years had passed and we could laugh about it..."

765750,NAW,2013-02-06 17:52:00,4022,"  I have never dropped a deuce on the ice before.  I spend at least 15 minutes on the can before every trip to make sure of that.  I have come home with some wicked stomach aches and absolutely destroyed my bathroom...  But have yet this crap on the Ice.  Not even when I was in Blair's hut, with a built in bathroom.  But the owner of the local doughnut shop / convenience store in Callender must HATE me!"

765792,bdox,2013-02-06 21:10:00,329,"Last year we drove up to Nipissing and ended up staying overnight on the ice, my buddy in his portable hut and me in the back of my old Blazer. I don't remember what we ate the night before but am I ever glad my buddy had the forethought to bring along some grocery bags and TP. We must have taken 2 or 3 turns each in the hut with a pail and bag. We ended up collapsing the hut and towing it to a new spot just to air it out."

765818,woodenboater,2013-02-06 22:39:00,2277,Am totally surprised to read very few bring TP with them on day trips. I always bring a couple of ziplocks with rolled up TP on river runs. Try getting out of a drysuit with 'neighbours about to bang on Door 2' kind of situation. And definitely make sure the 'workplace' is clear of your neck gasket ha ha. never happened to me but I can only imagine

It was really disgusting!  Dave Mercer also once mentioned a very interesting method for this when in a boat... think it involved a minnow bucket..."
765657,moxie,2013-02-06 04:45:00,1566,Bag it and take it with you when you leave?
765658,irishfield,2013-02-06 04:48:00,26272,That's the only correct answer... but I've heard and seen many others in partially drilled holes waiting for spring thaw.  Walk to shore and hang your  over a log.. well back from the waters edge.

765669,BillM,2013-02-06 05:40:00,17367,"Actually now that I think about it, I'm pretty sure I crapped down a hole when I was a kid fishing with the oldman!!   LOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  This thread is absolutely hilarious!!"

765703,Muskieman,2013-02-06 15:01:00,2472,"In my carefree teenage days , we were out on Nipissing in frigid cold in the wide open , the urge hit me , coffee and chili were the culprits , I jumped on my Safari 377 and headed to the nearest island , I admittedly b lined for a small cottage in hopes of using their restroom , I parked my sled in the back of a little cabin , with my helmet still on I decided to put my shoulder to the door , ( with full intent of repairing any damage ) the padlock busted open the door swung wide , OOHHH MY ! 4 burly men were sitting at a table playing cards ! The look on their faces !  At that moment , I totally forgot what I was there for , I sprinted back to my sled and made my way to the back channels of the French River , it took at least 5 minutes for the men to dawn their helmets and fire up huge sleds ... They never found me , but found and questioned my friends who were wondering where the hell I went ... They didn't rat me out ... Long story short I returned to "" Lucky Camp"" and repaired the damage with new hinges and a lock , I left the key on the front door .  Randy ."
765707,Rich,2013-02-06 15:21:00,3927," I know when we ice fish we have tendencies to eat a little less healthy than usual... Precooked sausages, venison steaks, frozen hamburger patties... Its easy to say ill just poop before I go, if you're not enjoying a fat smorgasboard in the hut. Lmao"

But as Rich said , NOT allways the case , and as you get old , maybe NEVER the case ,an icefishing  diet is , lets say not conducive to constipation and more likely leans towards anal leakage . I was out on the ice in a back lake and the chille dogs and beer hit my lower regions like a japanese bullit train .Ran to nearest island and hanging out over a log let go , now in the summer you can just reach out a grab a leaf or 5 to do clean up duties , but it being winter and no flora around I decided to sacrifice the boxers , it ment removeing all the lower layers , cold but I managed .. Back out on the ice someone asked me for a light , WHY I do not know but I had brought with me the gold zippo with the engraved bass and the I love you ,  my wife had given me years ago and was my pride and joy . Check all my pockets , NO ZIPPO !!!!! Where could it have gone , damn must had been when I undressed at the log .. Back to island and yes under the uglyest pile of dung , was my pride and joy , will leave the search in a allmost frozen pile to you readers to  amagine , never took it out icefishing  ever again .. and somehow  shall we say  ""THE BLOOM WAS OFF THE ROSE"" and still a great gift from the wife BUT !!!!! Was glad they banned smokeing in restaurants was hard after dinner to hear , Hey Capt you still got that zippo I need a light ..."
