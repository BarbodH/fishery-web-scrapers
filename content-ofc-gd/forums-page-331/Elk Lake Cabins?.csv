Did an afternoon trip to Elk Lake to take advantage of their beach... word to the wise, lots of leaches in the water! Jigs and worms for Pickereye and fishing ""golden hour"" (1 hour before sunset) netted us some nice Pickereyes and some fish frys. Chip wagon in Elk lake is a nice way to avoid cooking... HH"
