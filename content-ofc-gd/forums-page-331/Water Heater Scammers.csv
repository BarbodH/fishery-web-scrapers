There he is with his little plastic neck tag and the clipboard, Ontario Energy.  We're going around the neighbourhood to exchange water heaters.  Sorry I own mine, buzz off.   But, but, we have a good deal here,  sure you do, go to Sears and buy me another one.  I bought mine about 10 years ago, runs fine and I'm not paying well over $200 a year in rental.    Make sure you warn Granny and Grandpa if they're susceptable to these crows.  Maybe warn a couple of the other feeble minded ones too."

766079,pidge,2013-02-07 23:43:00,438,If not a 60 surely a 75 lol.

766121,EC1,2013-02-08 01:53:00,930,"Had that happen not long ago. They tell you that it's ""No Charge"" except for the rent.... Except there's like $700 worth of stuff you need to pay on the bill.  If you know anyone that's been scammed by that, tell them to look on their receipt. There is a number to call to cancel before it's too late."
766124,moxie,2013-02-08 02:13:00,1566,hehehe.
766125,moxie,2013-02-08 02:14:00,1566,    hehehe....
766148,chris.brock,2013-02-08 03:49:00,4053,"well put,  if anybody reading this is renting a waterheater, it's a scam, take the time, make some calls, and buy your rental or get out of the rental agreement  monthly payments can really add up over the years  these guys are snakes"
