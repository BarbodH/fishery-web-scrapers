763421,moxie,2013-01-29 15:18:00,1566,"Champix had me off the sticks for 5 months years back but the random piercing temple pains and the fact that I wasn't ready to quit ended that streak . Most use different coping mechanisms and/or combinations thereof . Then there are those that can drop the habit like trash. I dislike those people.....hehehe. Imo, Deciding you were ""ready"" to quit was the single most defining factor in the process and should be what you commit to in times of weakness. It can be a helluva nut to crack. A cousin of mine has been clean for 5 years and still has cravings at times. Keep at it and Best of luck.    Question. Have anglers ever really need an excuse to buy equipment?"

765936,muddler,2013-02-07 12:37:00,623,"There are 3 things that you have to try to control when quitting smoking. 1. Psychological addiction 2. Physical addiction 3. Chemical addiction.  1. Like all addictions, smoking is like your best friend. Always there and you felt better afterward. You belonged to an exclusive group...the smokers. Yup, it's in your head. That's what Champx and Zyban are supposed to help control. Both are mild antidepressants and one of the side effects is that they help block those good buddy urges by releasing some chemical (can't remember the name)in your body that make you feel better. Unfortunately there are some negative side effects too for some people. To make me feel good when I quit, I started fly tying. I got pretty good at it after a while and I have thousands of flies to prove it. Caught a lot of steelhead with them too. I keep focused on tying in the winter every time I had a chance. In the warmer months I took up wood working.I started to make book selves. I made my daughter a loft bed and a lot of bird feeders. I found that if I stayed busy and accomplished things that I didn't need a smoke as a reward. I fixed a pile of things in the house too. I also learned to cook a lot of different meals. Got pretty good at that too.  2.The physical addiction was the easiest part to control. You know the drill. Check the smokes before the variety store closes. The lighter is in your right hand pants pocket when you leave the house. The smokes are in your back pocket. The smokes are always on the coffee table on the same spot. You check them a least 10 times a day. You get the idea. A lighter that didn't work anymore was a major crisis. Well, I replaced all that with a water bottle. I found a little one (250ml I think) at a dollar store and I carried it around everywhere, even to the bathroom when doing my morning business. Didn't go anywhere without it. And I drank a pile of water. I guess that help flush out the nicotine in my system.  3. The chemical addiction didn't take too long to deal with. After a couple of weeks I felt that urge to smoke only when I was really stressed.  I started my evening walks. Everyday, rain or shine, hot or cold I go for a 45 minute walk. -29C is the coldest I'v walked in. So some of my neighbours have joined in and now we have a group of 4 guys that walk almost everyday. I bike almost everyday when it's warm. Need milk and bread, I just jump on the bike and go. Bring the water bottle. No more urges.  My weight went up about 20 pounds at first but slowly  I lost most of it. I don't feel any better than I did when I was smoking(my health was good then).  I learned to fly tie and now I am making trolling spoons for walleye. I found that if I didn't think about smoking I didn't.  Stay active and set positive goals for yourself. Aim high, you'll be surprised what you can accomplish. All the advice that these guys have given is so true. Once you quit, you will look back and laugh, ""What was I thinking....""  That was 15+ years ago.  muddler"
765997,mercman,2013-02-07 17:30:00,7054,"Day 19 for me, and other than the odd crave, its been pretty easy(touch wood). Two more weeks left on Habitrol patches, Step 1, then i step down. Spoke with the pharmacist, and to control the odd strong crave, he suggested the Nicorette Lozenge.It contains 2mg of Nicotine, same as a cigarette.So far, i ahve only needed 1. First thing i noticed, was that my cough is gone, and no more wheezing.Now my sense of smell is amazeing!! someone said i looked younger, but thats from the love, not from me quitting I started an excersize program before quitting, and am stepping it up a notch.Down 40 lbs, so hope i dont gain it back"

756817,Guest,2013-01-06 16:35:00,0,When it comes to the hardest thing iv done so far it would have to be quitting smoking.  I smoked for about 10 years and it caused severe asthma.  I still remember using my puffer after smoking a cig lol.  I knew I had to quit so I decided not to go cold turkey and use the patch.  Not many people can quit cold turkey and I wouldnt think it would be the greatest advice to tell someone to do it that way.  If you can then good for you.  There are things out there like champex and the patch that can give you an advantage.  Champex worked for my dad and the patch worked for me.  It took me almost 6 months to eventually quit cause I would stop then get drunk and start up again.  Another tip is to remove yourself from places where it might trigger you to have a smoke.  Mine was on break at work and I used to sit outside with the same people smoking.  I couldnt do that anymore so I had to sit with the nonsmokers.  Its been 2 and a half years and I still feel the urge and I have a feeling its never going to go away.  I also saved about $300 a month which is nice too.  Goodluck to anyone quiting and remember it gets easier everyday.  Thanks

I kicked the habit on Weedless Wed 31 years ago---probably the best decision I ever made.  There seemed to be some good news on the radio today.

762371,mercman,2013-01-25 04:00:00,7054,"I finally joined the ranks of non smokers. I was always too afraid to face the DT's. I quit drinking 24 years ago this may, and the DT's, sleepless nights drenched in cold sweats and dry heaves that followed for weeks afterward were always in the back of my mind.I could never be strong enough to go through that again. I finally, with the help of a close friend, said This is it. I picked up a box of step 1 Habitrol patches, power smoked my last pack of Players in about 6 hours, and slapped a patch on my shoulder. The combined nicotine of the smokes and the patch made me puke   but the next morning(last monday) i was fine. No edgeyness, no burning yearning for a puff, just a satisfied feeling that i will beat this.God willing, tomorrow will be 6 days smoke free.I never ever went even 6 hours without a smoke in my life.I started getting really worried last december, when i would wake up in the middle of the nite, smoke, then go back to bed.It bothered me that i couldnt even sleep without the urge takeing over. The patch does its job, and i feel comfortable and unaffected by the withdraw. Hats off to all you cold turkey guys. I am just not strong enough to do that. My mouth is still dry and tastes like an ashtray, but i have no desire to lite up at this point. IT CAN BE DONE !!!  Paul"

My advice to you is stay strong and don't let your guard down for a minute. I am trying the same. I am too scared I might actual enjoy that puff and restart."
762714,grt1,2013-01-26 07:17:00,638,"well, i finally got to the point where the smokes didn't taste good so i had my last cigar on the way home from work on Jan 16 at 1am. so tonight it has been 9 days without smoking and it really wasn't too bad, just the odd twinge and i have put away 10 dollars a day for every day i havent bought any.  tonight i come home from work and my neighbour who just came home from mexico had come over and brought me a package with 5 cuban cigars and one that has 4 cigars from mexico. what a bummer, i just know i'm going to get into them it will just be a matter of time. hopefully it won't put me back in the smoking trend again."

763202,Steel28,2013-01-28 18:04:00,160,I read through this thread and congrats to all of you who quit this habit and to all who provided their support and advice.  It's been 8 days for me quitting cold turkey. I'm 36 and smoked for 20 years. Most of the these years I smoked 10 cigarettes a day but for last year I smoked 3 a day but it was still very tough on weekends with few beers + my fishing/hunting trips.  I've decided not to icefish this year just to keep away from smoking habit  So far it feels great and I hope it will continiue this way. I've tried quitting before but always slipped after a few days.
763244,bassdreamer,2013-01-28 20:53:00,128,Congrats to all the guys that quit the nasty habit ! For me its been 27  cold turkey days ! Ive been smoking for 33yrs !

Zyban has also been known to create bad depression in users. My Doctor is convinced the only way to go is cold turkey with an aid like Nicorette or patch. I only know this as 3 years ago when Champix came out I tried it and quite. I stayed a non smoker for 2 1/2 years and as people have mentioned above the ""one"" cigarette got me right back into it. I have been speaking to my Doctor recently about quitting smoking again and she explained the above about Champix and Zyban to me and is reluctant to prescribe it again. Damn smokes. The weight that comes with quitting concerns me as well...but the last time I quit I stayed fairly active so I didn't pack on a lot of weight but I did put on a few extra pounds. No easy answer or way to quit."
750829,Old Man,2012-12-10 21:12:00,822," So true. I quit at age 20 for 7 years, a few cigars and I was back into it in no time. When I quit 16 years ago, I went into it with the thought that ""I was one puff away from a pack a day"". I will never take that one puff ever again."
750830,Fish Farmer,2012-12-10 21:18:00,2234,"I never smoked but a friend told me he put 5 old butts in a pill bottle and filled it with water, put the cap on and giver a shake. He put it in his pocket, every time he felt the craving, he opened the bottle and stuck his finger in and shoved some of the juice up his nose. Didn't take long for him to quite. Or it could have been the quadruple bypass they did when they opened his guys up. Good luck Rich. All the money you spent on that crap you could be driving a new ProV Lund. Just a thought Stick to it Rich"
750905,Ralph Field,2012-12-11 00:22:00,1018,"As I mentioned before I quit with the aid of Champix Dec 26 ,2010. On Feb. 13, 2010 I fell and broke my ankle and have since had 3 operations on it. Through quitting smoking and being very inactive ,due to my ankle, I've gained 40 pounds and developed type 2 diabetes . I often wonder if I should have quit with all that has happened since I quit."

You think you liked smoking?  Wait until you succeed at being a non-smoker!!!!  Rich, I was feeling the same thing....just wasn't enjoying it anymore....if in fact I ever really did.  I believe your receptors enjoy the nicotine, but beyond that there is nothing good to be gained from smoking....period.  Nothing....period.  I honestly couldn't put a single thing in the ""pros"" column.  I chose my 40th birthday as my quit day and will never smoke another cigarette in my life.....ever....period.  Tried many times before (cold turkey, ""weaning off"", Champix, bets with buddies, blah blah blah) but this time I win.  Determination, conviction and more determination is the best way IMHO, not to say others won't work - pick from the myriad of suggests above and stick with it.  ""Fight fire with fire"".  ""I won't ever smoke another cigarette in my life""....wish I had a penny for every time I've said or thought this since I quit, although I hardly ever have to now.  Repetition is what got us all into this mess so seemed like a good technique to get me out of it.  ""I'll never smoke after my 40th birthday"".  ""I won't ever smoke another cigarette in my life""  repeat repeat repeat....by saying these things to as many people as will stop and listen I've left myself little choice but to keep succeeding.  I sincerely wish you the best of luck but honestly luck has nothing to do with it, no matter how you choose to go forward.  It really sounds to me like you've gotten past the most difficult hurdle.....YOU WANT TO QUIT.  You have quit.  Stay quit.  Cravings are short.  Don't make this any more complicated than it needs to be.  ""I won't ever smoke another another cigarette in my life"".....beautiful"

Keep at er guys.  It gets easier.  I started jogging as well (if you can call it that lol)  That has really helped.  For myself, I found it too much to think about quitting as one big process.

I made rules to always smoke outside, when in college don't go get my jacket for a quick smoke outside which turned to always, and buy the poverty packs (15 smokes) after I worked my way down to 1/2 pack a day. Then made a rule to only smoke 1/2 a poverty pack a day. Then one day while outside freezing my bic I realized how much of a fool I thought I was. Paying more money for less smokes, freezing my bic, these silly rules, yellow fingers and teeth and threw the pack in the garbage and the extra 2 packs at home and swore to not waste anymore money or time or restart.

One thing that spurred me on was the birth of my youngest son. I couldn't justify exposing him and the rest of the family to second hand smoke. Standing outside in the elements didn't appeal to me.  These 2 posts have the ring of truth about them:---   I found that having a beer increased the urge. I recall taking unshelled sunflower seeds out with me when my wife and I went out to a PTA dance or whatever!! I needed something to keep my hands busy. Lunchtime at work was another hurdle. I started to jog on my lunch break so I didn't have time to smoke then.  Looking back I have often thought, like muddler, it was the best decision of my life.  An additional incentive is the $$ you'll save. Just think of all the fancy fishing gear yo'll be able to buy!      "

750349,funfishing,2012-12-09 05:26:00,147,"Congrats on getting the notion to quit...  The 2 step idea, of first getting off the habit by either using a vaporizer, patch or gum, sounds like a good plan, because you stop smoking first, then afterwards you just have to stop the nicotine intake. In university, I ""smoked"" fairly regularly for a semester, and made a $200 investment towards a good vaporizer. My lungs thanked me, and after I had my fun I sold it for almost as much as I paid for it.  There's a book out there for quitting, my neighbour read it and he said it brainwashed him into quitting. He successfully quit just with the book.  You also have to examine your lifestyle and your peers. Does everyone around you smoke? Friends, family, coworkers, significant other? If there's a lot of smokers in your life, you will have to have the resolve not to let others around you distract you from your goal of quitting.  It is quite sad to see some of the after effects of long-term smoking, research it like crazy and that should give you additional reason for quitting. Smoking a while back when there was less crap in cigarettes was one thing, but modern day cigarettes are really full of crap.  You can also try to find a good hypnotist. Uri Geller might not be available, but search around and you should be able to find one locally for a good price.  Last but not least your wallet will thank you...  My health collapsed completely earlier this year due to a few reasons, not from smoking though as I was never a smoker. You don't know how precious your health is until it starts to decline..cherish it and nurture and nourish your body while it's still strong..and you will live longer and happier."
750361,Rich,2012-12-09 12:11:00,3927,"Day 1: not so bad. No craving for a cigarette whatsoever yet, even with a cup of java down the hole. I think the best advice was the ""dont smoke in the morning"" rule. I thought about it and, in the morning, when i light up that first smoke, i usually crave a couple more before work. If i just dont have that ""first"" smoke.. HOPEFULLY i never get that first craving!  I cant thank you all enough for the support and advice. Im hoping this is the time i crush the habit, so i can spend just a little more on that 'other' habit of chasing fishies"

750428,ch312,2012-12-09 15:53:00,1590," smokers do stink VERY bad and when a smoker walks into a non smoking area (office, store, house, etc) it's often like someone just opened the lid of a dumpster, especially those who enjoy Rez smokes. but, i wouldn't go as far as calling it the dirtiest habit, hard drug users easily win that one. but, it is astonishing how many smokers have no clue how bad the odor actually is until they quit.  good luck to everyone who's trying to quit."

750678,Rich,2012-12-10 13:06:00,3927," I started because my dad and grandfather told me a cigarette was the only way to celebrate a big fish. And the guys on tv were wrong of course, smoking was harmless. True story.  But lots of people do things that dont make any sense. Its called human error. I dont understand why alcohol is a legal drug, or why people willingly consume it.. but there are new alcoholics everyday.  Im just glad i wont repeat the cycle of my dads side of the family, smoking for 30 years then dropping of a heart attack."
750679,Rich,2012-12-10 13:09:00,3927,"Oh and my dad always ate just as often as he smoked lol that never changed, but after quitting smoking he turned from all food to a straight up candy bar addiction. And THAT hurt him in a whole lot shorter period than smoking ever did"
750684,Fish4Eyes,2012-12-10 13:31:00,1022,Cold turkey is best. For cravings buy yourself a tub of sugar free candies and munch away to keep you busy. Don't drink for a few weeks either as cravings will only increase.

Don't smoke as much, but still....I ordered my e-cig it last week and hopefully should be in today.  I'll let you know how it turns out.  I have bought e-cigs at gas stations before and they are garbage.  Good luck."
750757,Squid,2012-12-10 17:45:00,1656,Champix worked for me and I have never looked back. If you fail with the cold turkey go see your doctor and get on Champix. It blcoks the nicotene from getting to the required receptors in your brain.

750179,fishinmortician,2012-12-08 14:55:00,100,"I quit cold turkey after 15 years. Seeing hundreds of people over the years pass of cancer and lay on my table finally made me clue in.  I'll never get those years back, but hope it helps me in the long run. Picturing myself on the steel table was a good realization! Find something that takes your mind off it like taking your rod and tackle box for a good bushwack. Best of Luck and don't give up!"
750181,ch312,2012-12-08 15:02:00,1590,"something i've observed over the years as a non smoker is that nothing will work unless YOU want to quit. the last two times you tried, did you have the same ""i can feel them wreaking havoc on my guts every morning, and i dont wanna be chained to them anymore."" feeling about the smokes? if not, it sounds like you're serious about it this time and you're ready to toss them. IMO, your mind is more powerful than any patch, gum, or pill.  here's to hoping you can drop the habit. your family, kids, and taxpayers will appreciate it  good luck  :thumbsup_anim:"
750182,ch312,2012-12-08 15:08:00,1590, i still can't wrap my head around the idea of people working in hospitals on terminally ill lung cancer patients and then going out for a smoke break...
750188,bigugli,2012-12-08 15:21:00,6138,I used to watch cancer inpatients huddling outside the hospital doors to have another smoke. Addiction is a powerful thing. It took a mass coronary for me to quit.
750198,ehg,2012-12-08 15:55:00,2666,"Seemed to me it wasn't really an addiction to nicotine that had to be conquered but breaking a habit of movements. Used to be wake up step outside for smoke, go to car smoke, drive smoke, come back from store smoke, etc... So instead of smoking would always grab water/pop/candy and eased away. After 25 yrs of smoking haven't bought cigarettes for 5 yrs or so now.  It is not so much the nicotine but habit of movement. Good Luck."
750199,muddler,2012-12-08 15:59:00,623,"Opps!  Congratulations. You taken the first difficult step. I used Xyban(it's like Champex) when it first came out for about 3 months. Eventually I found that I was down to 3 or 4 cigarettes a day. I then added the lowest dosage nicotine patch and the two weeks later I quit. That was Oct 6, 1998. I haven't had one since. As an added bonus I paid myself $5 each day. That was what a pack of smokes went for back then. One year later I walked into Angling Specialties with $1825 and bought an ANSPEC float reel ($650) a float rod and a pile of tackle. The only time in my life that I played the big spender. That fall I fished rainbows and I'd chuckle that I used smoke all this away.  This worked for me. I set a goal and stuck with it. There were many times in that first year that I wanted to light up, but with a little help from my fiends I hung in there. If I really wanted a smoke I used licorice as a substitute. I took up fly tying so that I had a hobby in the winter time. Been tying ever since.  I wish that I could say that quitting smoking was easy, it wasn't. It was all worth it eventually. I still have the float reel and I just have a tough time parting with it. I tie flies pretty well now and I feel great.  Good luck. You've made the  best decision ever in your life.  muddler"
750202,grt1,2012-12-08 16:28:00,638,"my dad once told me that quitting smoking was easy, he'd done it hundreds of times.  I'm in the same boat as you I should quit as the drs have told me i got copd. but it is going to take a lot of will power and perserverance.  i quit many years ago and all i did was put away the cost of 1 pack of smokes a day, that was abot 5 bucks, at today's rate, i would be putting away 10 bucks a day and watch my money grow.   I think this is the route i'll be taking, at least this way i can put money away for next season's minnows and boat gas."
750203,dhickey,2012-12-08 16:39:00,1038,Its one of the hadrdest things to do. Years ago I quit using a method desinged to break habbits along with ruducing nicotine intacke over the course of a couple monthes. It involves counting how many you have each day now devide that buy 17(hours of the day most people are awake) This gives you an average time(ex  17 smokes per day = 1 per hour) Now only have 1 smoke evey 1.5 hours over a 17 hour day. for week one. Week 2 go 2 hours between smokes. Continue this untill your down to 3 or 4 per day. By that time the taste of a smoke will probably be undesirable. quit all together.  ps. dont smoke first thing in the morning you have to wiat whether its 1 hour or 5 hours for the first smoke. Thats the key to breaking the habbits of smoking and reducing cravings.  Good luck  Saltydawg.
750210,Beans,2012-12-08 17:15:00,3339,"A couple of the best decisions I've made in my lifetime was to quit drinking (40 years ago) and smoking(25 years ago)...  Like you, I was smoking more and enjoying it less...  My wife's workplace was becoming a smokeless enviroment so I thought I would join them...Maribeth lasted 3 months but I'm still clean...(she later quit for sure a couple of years later after one of our grandsons fell asleep while waiting for her to come back in from the car)...  My route was cold turkey but no matter the method...  DO IT !!!  An old friend, who took a non-smoking class at a hospital told me that a craving only lasts two minutes and they keep getting further apart as time goes by so , I had the mindset that nothing, absolutely nothing was going to make me take a cigarette...I chewed gum or ate a gourmet jelly bean or a cold glass of something (OJ, AJ, Water, etc.)...anything to help me past the craving...  It wasn't so much as will power as won't power...  I wish you the best and remember to keep it simple...Just stop putting them in your mouth !!!"
750211,Old Man,2012-12-08 17:22:00,822,"For the wife and I, it was the patch. The patch got us through the chemical craving phase, after that it's breaking old habits, that's the hardest part. It's been 16 years now and we can't even imagine ever having smoked. You'll enjoy the freedom when you succeed. Wishing you success. Life is so much better without that monkey on your back."
750213,limeyangler,2012-12-08 17:28:00,5204,I was scared to do it for a long time....did not think i could.  Used the patches and found it relatively easy (my wife would differ).  Try the patches is my advice...there is a definite addiction to nicotine involved here....so this will help with the physical aspect of quitting.  There is a mental aspect that is in my opinion the key to staying stopped. Keep it simple...remember a craving is just a feeling that will pass.....do whatever you have to do do distract yourself...even just telling myself this helps me to ride out the cravings.  Its been a year and a half for me...i still crave them sometimes...but 99.999% of the time i dont even think about it....ITS AWESOME.  GOOD LUCK....ITS WORTH IT.   Oh...and another good thing...i have cash to spare for the first time in ages....the amount of new stuff i bought this year is amazing.
750219,DoubleDigits,2012-12-08 18:04:00,140," Read Allan Carr's 'Easy Way to Stop Smoking'  Follow the instructions, don't cut down, smoke and read and quit."
750223,Garnet,2012-12-08 18:28:00,2056,Your routines are the worst.  Start the car buckle seat belt and smoke.  Eat diner and smoke.  Land a fish and smoke.  Get a handle on how much food you eat. Ham Cheese Sandwiches on white bread and Cheeseburgers packed the lb's on me.  Actively will distract you from cravings just not food.  And cut your coffee down.

Some will say the best time to quit is at the beginning of a big life change.  As well as the physical, one must break the mental cycle that keeps you thinking it's time for a smoke."
750232,lew,2012-12-08 18:53:00,12766,"Before you quit smoking you have to be absolutely committed to quitting and if your not, you'll never be successful. Tell yourself your not gonna smoke again and then don't...COLD TURKEY.  I think all the books and patches and whatever else are just crutches, sorta like trying to teach a kid to swim with water wings on his arms.  I was addicted to those filthy stinkin things for 30 years but have been free for 22 years now.  Back in the early days of my fire fighting career we didn't always use masks to go into burning buildings, but would often just go in holding our breath and stay as long as we could or else smash a window out to get some air then get back to work. After the fire was out we'd come outside gagging, coughing and puking and the 1st thing we'd do was light up a cigarette.  Seemed normal back then but it just shows how much of an addiction those things really are.  Toss the smokes away Rich and  start enjoying life without them, it's not nearly as tough as you may think....as long as you REALLY want to quit."

750263,Jet,2012-12-08 21:00:00,364,"This might be replacing one habit for another, but have you thought about an electronic cigarette aka vaping?  I know many people who have replaced their tabacco cigarettes for e-cigs. As many of you mentioned, it's the physical habit of ""smoking"" that often is the hardest thing to overcome mentally when you try to quit.  This gives you that physical ""action"" without all the harmful effects of smoke.  I used to smoke and quit buying packs a long long time ago. However I still enjoy a smoke here and there, especially when fishing! I also exercise very regularly and can notice the cardiovascular difference when I smoke and don't smoke. However with the e-cig I feel literally no cardio diff at all.  I believe at the very least if you can replace tar ridden smoke for water vapor, you'll do your health a monumental favour in addition to not smelling like smoke or having that smoker's morning cough.  And winter's a great time to try quitting, as the cold can be a great incentive to stay inside. E-cigs leave absolutely no smell so using them inside is no problem in that regard.   Here's a good testimony for it.   <iframe width=""420"" height=""315"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/dFQm2G4mz3w"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>"
