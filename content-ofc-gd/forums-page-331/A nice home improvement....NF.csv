765382,wormdunker,2013-02-05 08:02:00,1711,"Lew I did a similar job with beams in the ceiling of my family room.    Used a torch to etch burn marks on the surface of the wood.  Applied a clear varnish to seal the wood.  Looked pretty good.  Would show u pix, but, I sold that house."
765389,lew,2013-02-05 11:46:00,12766,"wormdunker, I've seen those burnt beams before and they also look good, thanks for the suggestion. I used to store my last boat in a barn just down the road from here . The place was built back in 1850 and is loaded with square beams up to probably 12 X 12 and some maybe 25-30 feet long. The beams are still as straight as the day they were cut and everything is held together with wooden pegs.  I wonder if the farmer knows he's sitting on a small fortune  I also wonder if barns being built today by modern standards will still be standing strong and straight 150 odd years from now ??    "
765398,motv8tr,2013-02-05 12:54:00,2587,Very nice Lew!!!
765490,bigbuck,2013-02-05 19:56:00,2449,Very nice Lew!! We are kicking around the idea of putting a propane stove in the basement of the cottage to keep things semi warm and dry during the winter months. At least you don't need to keep the fire stoked all night long on these cold winter nights.
765499,Gerritt,2013-02-05 20:20:00,6129,"Very nice Lew, I really like the Ledge Rock (Owen Sound?) It really makes it a nice focal point, I too am undergoing renovations, the GF is not too happy about the house being upside down though...   but when they are complete it will be a new house.  What I am doing...  scraping paint off every room in the house as the builder did not use primer on the walls, before painting them in OIL based paint... the paint is coming off in strips... ugh what a mess... Re-taping every joint and skim coating all surfaces Stucco scraped from ceiling New textured ceiling is in place (Knockdown) New paint through out <--- this is where I am at now....  The whole house is carpet... all being ripped up New 3/4"" White oak being installed Honey colour in all the main areas, darker colour in the bedrooms... In a pet safe finish (Matte) New Doors and frames through out w/ casing Removal of old carpet baseboard and new installed through out..  its a ton of work and some serious $$ but in the end worth it  Next is the bathrooms and kitchen.... UGH..  Nice to see your finished product while I am living in a mess!  G"
765500,TJQ,2013-02-05 20:21:00,7806,Very nice Lew!!
765506,discophish,2013-02-05 20:49:00,392,Awesome job with this!  Looks amazing!  Really nice transformation  I will be installing wood burning inserts at some point in our two fireplaces.  I bought 2 very old barn doors that are 9'x5' and hanging them horizontally on either side of the fireplace.  Should look nice against the field stone.  I'm sure that the farmers are aware of the market value for barn wood these days.  I bet they have people knocking on their door every week!
765509,Spiel,2013-02-05 21:09:00,9065,"Looks beautiful Lew and labour free, a real bonus for us old guys."
765512,aplumma,2013-02-05 21:14:00,6896,Lew here is the finish of what I described  before           Art
765554,lew,2013-02-05 22:55:00,12766,"I like that board Art, it really does gve it an aged appearance.  Gerritt, sounds like you've got some very serious work ahead of you, hopefully you'll get most of it done by the time the nice weather arrives and good luck with it.  Thanks once again everyone for the nice comments."
765555,Gerritt,2013-02-05 22:59:00,6129,"If you are looking for a hand hewed beam Lew, let me know. My Uncle has a farm in Havlock... circa 1897.... and has a few kicking around."
765568,lew,2013-02-05 23:27:00,12766,"Thanks much Gerritt, I may just take you up on that if I don't find anything around here. I'm only 30 minutes from Havlock.  I'm looking for something 6x6 and about 75"" long, old and preferably  one that's been outside and exposed to the weather for a long time."
765569,nancur373,2013-02-05 23:28:00,1211,Awesome job.
765577,Gerritt,2013-02-05 23:48:00,6129,PM sent
765680,RangerGuy,2013-02-06 11:43:00,564,Very nice Lew!  I'm trying to convince my wife that we want a fire place in the basement.. Its not goin well haha!  
765683,lew,2013-02-06 11:56:00,12766,"She'll probably be very happy with it Greg, IF you can talk her into it."
765798,Squid,2013-02-06 21:21:00,1656,"Looks really nice Lew. Of course my preference will always be an open wood fireplace, yeah I know it is a waste of energy but so nice to sit in front of."
765807,Cudz,2013-02-06 21:59:00,2652,Like night and day!  It really modernizes your room.  Very nice
764735,lew,2013-02-02 22:51:00,12766,I have a wood burning stove downstairs in the family room and a wood burning fireplace upstairs in the living room. Never really liked the one in the living room though and decided to switch it over to a propane insert.  Here's the old    And this is the new insert.    Next I wanted to upgrade the brick so we decided to go with a multi-coloured Legerstone.    The stonework was finished yesterday and we spent today getting the room all put back together and we're both very pleased with the way it turned out.      Just thought I'd post the pictures incase anyone is interested in this kind of stuff.
764738,Twocoda,2013-02-02 22:57:00,4130,I always love seeing before and after pics of renovations....it looked like a great space before the reno but now its even better without the dust and such that the wood stove provided...Fantastic job!!! Whens the basement warming party?
764742,Whopper,2013-02-02 23:06:00,2174,"Looks good Lew!  We switched from a wood insert to natural gas log set and we absolutely love it. No more wood and mess in the house, even has a remote control."
764748,wuchikubo,2013-02-02 23:17:00,1114,"Great job Lew, if you did the brickwork, how long did it take? It's been a project to do on my mind too."
764749,Joey,2013-02-02 23:19:00,9122,"Looks really, really good Lew, great job!!"
764758,muskeybugged,2013-02-02 23:25:00,282,"Looks sweet, changes the whole complex of the room, great job!  Hate too see the new gas bill though.  none-the-less"
764762,lew,2013-02-02 23:29:00,12766,"Thanks folks, we're very happy now that we decided to change it all.  And Stan, no I didn't do it myself, but had it installed by the same company I purchased the stone from. They did the whole job in 2 days and really did an excellent job."
764763,lew,2013-02-02 23:32:00,12766, My whole house runs on propane and I've got a 1500 litre tank in the backyard so I should be good for awhile
764773,misfish,2013-02-03 00:00:00,29133,Thats SO not    LOL  I like the wood burners myself. Stone work looks nice.New age.Kinda yuppie.LOL  .
764910,Beans,2013-02-03 17:18:00,3339,Very nice Lew...I might look into doing the same to my wood burning stove...
764917,Roy,2013-02-03 17:35:00,13728,"Absolutely beautiful, Lew! I see  some Diane influence in there.  I did mine a few years ago...wood burning still but went from modern to rustic.  I guess you and Diane are getting younger and J and I are floundering into old age.  Hell, we even re-did all of our white leather upholstery to a flowery textile just to aggravate the kids."
764918,tb4me,2013-02-03 17:36:00,3295,Looks fantastic Lew..Congrats on a job well done my man!
764925,crappieperchhunter,2013-02-03 17:53:00,2582,I think it looks fantastic Lew. It sure is nice when a home reno turns out well. I bet you are spending a lot of time just looking at it. I know that's what I do when something gets spruced up and makes the place look better.  Careful though...cause now it looks like the walls might need a new coat of paint. You know what they say....give a mouse a cookie...
764926,Rizzo,2013-02-03 18:15:00,4754,wow that looks great!
764933,woodenboater,2013-02-03 18:34:00,2277,"I'm not one for gas fireplaces but that looks pretty damn cozy Lew. Hope the weather gets cold enough for you get lots of use out of it <wink, wink>"
764934,lew,2013-02-03 18:36:00,12766," Actually Norm, my next plan is to build a wooden mantle similar to what you have in your living room, but I'm thinking of an old weathered beam from a barn if I can find one. Your 100 % correct Roy, I wanted all white marble but as usual the wife always wins any decorating discussion and we went with the Legerstone. Course I'll never give in and admit to her that she was right.   The walls were just painted a year ago Steve, but I'm sure the Mrs. will find me something else to do as soon as she sees me sitting down for more than 2 minutes.  Thanks again everyone."
764971,Twocoda,2013-02-03 22:01:00,4130,When the Tornado hit Goderich awhile year i managed to aquire a beam from a fallen barn and used it on my fireplace....Spray the beam with insecticide and wrap it in plastic for a week to ensure there are no surprises hiding in the wood....Ive done a couple of fireplaces with beams and you must make sure you can anchor to the studs for additional support to the stone to carry the load....Beams are very heavy....If your fortunate enough to find some wooden pegs from the old construction ...they incorportate nicely into the the beam for hanging stockings at Christmas time....We put 5 pegs (one for each bedroom) I have better pics on my other computer of the finished product but here are a few of when i was putting it all together   
764998,lew,2013-02-03 23:35:00,12766,"That beam looks fantastic TC and is very similar to what I'm talking about.  I already have an existing cement mantle and am thinking of hollowing out a beam, cutting it to fit from every angle to fit over & hide the mantle, and fastening it onto the cement to give the impression of a solid beam. Once I get it formed, the actual wood parts will only be about 1"" thick and the beam will be very light compared to a full thickness beam, but will still appear to be a full size....hopefully.  I know what I'm trying to say, but it's hard to put into words but I'm sure you understand  There's a couple old barns around here that are basically falling down and I'm planning on going to talk to the owners and see if we can work something out.  "
765212,aplumma,2013-02-04 20:30:00,6896,"Nice job Lew it is such a pleasure to get away from burning wood in my opinion. You also can look into getting some 1"" X ?"" soft wood (pine or Poplar etc.) and having it sandblasted. You can get a very rustic look that will take a stain and have texture.   Art"
765231,lew,2013-02-04 21:01:00,12766,"Thanks Art, that's another option. Never heard of the sandblasting but I have considered building someting nice with dimentional lumber.  We don't use the fireplace for heat, but more for appearance when we have friends over, but it'll be nice now not having to carry wood into the living room."
765237,mr blizzard,2013-02-04 21:26:00,1589,"Lew it looks amazing, beautiful job.  The original pics of the room looked pretty darn nice, but the renovation is also very sweet.  The room has a lot of appeal. You can save money by doing it yourself but in the interest of time occasionaly it is nice to treat yourself and just ""gitter done"". Obviously money well spent. I am also glad my wife is out right now  lol"
765242,lew,2013-02-04 21:50:00,12766,"Thanks mr. blizzard, I like to support the local craftsmen sometimes."
765268,aplumma,2013-02-04 23:37:00,6896,My Grandpa made me a hatch cover table many years ago using this method and it removes the softer part of the wood and leaves the knots and deepens the grains of the wood. He then stained and sealed it and installed black 2 inch bands on the ends.   Art
765274,lew,2013-02-04 23:54:00,12766,"Never heard of the technique before Art, but it sounds interesting."
765376,Twocoda,2013-02-05 05:19:00,4130,"I put a 16 foot beam in for a customer a few years ago ...he supplied the 8""x8""x16' beam (paid 600 for it) I acquired an identical beam to his for a bottle of Scotch so it didnt hurt so much when i cut it down to 9 feet to accomadate my desired length Both are hemlock and very heavy....i have so many anchors in them that if there is ever a tsunami on lake huron ..the town may dissapear but his and my beams will still be there....there are many ways to achieve the look your after sounds like you have a solid plan..Good luck with the future project"
