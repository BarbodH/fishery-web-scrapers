456036,spincast,2010-04-14 21:44:00,3279,"Most couriers will assess a brokerage fee based on the value of the shipment as a declaration needs to be made. Sometimes, this can be as much as the value of the shipment - for instance I once ordered some flyers from the US DOT for a conference and they put a nominal value of $1.00 per info package. I ordered about 200, and the customs fees came to over $100.00. Terry nailed it for GST & HST. For the scoop from CBSA: http://www.canadapost.ca/tools/pg/manual/PGcustoms-e.asp from another all knowing(?) internet source: http://doesitblog.wordpress.com/2010/01/12/international-shipping-into-canada/  Wonder who many CCRA audit dudes are members........"
456138,Oggie,2010-04-15 01:07:00,588,"Terry is absolutely right! If they ship UPS (and they do!) or Purolator, bend over when the man in brown knocks at your door. The brokerage fee is unreal sometimes and it does seem to be determined by a monkey spinning a wheel of chance.  USPS does not charge a brokerage fee and it arrives Canada Post for no additional charges.  BTW the brokerage fee is a scam. It doesn't cost them anything to move the product over the border. UPS and Purolator are both under investigation for this bogus charge (second hand information).  Dan O."
456143,TC1OZ,2010-04-15 01:15:00,987," I ordered standard, so it will be coming regular mail. And brokerage fee's aren't a scam. My old boss is a customs broker for the trucking industry, and if he didn't get paid I'm not sure how his wife and children would eat. Terrible second hand information."
456151,Terry,2010-04-15 01:25:00,14456,some carriers charge a standard 7 bucks broker fee some like USPS doesn't charge broker fee  UPS screws us every single time with no rhyme or reason for the amounts they charge  IMO they are ripping us off because Canada isn't important to their over all business so they capitalize on us to off set local deliveries
456174,irishfield,2010-04-15 02:11:00,26272,"The post office DOES charge a Brokerage (Handling) fee. $5 is added to the GST and PST you have to pay on the value. Fedex charges $7... UPS = crown and anchor wheel, generally between $25 and $70. If it isn't made in the USA/Canada or Mexico.. and if Customs feels like it they'll get you for duty."
456180,adempsey,2010-04-15 02:18:00,1498," I only ordered from BPS a couple of times a while back so I don't recall for certain how they figured out the brokerage fee, but I do know I did not pay anything when I got my package.  They may have sent me my bill via email and required my confirmation prior to shipping, but I cannot recall.  Cabelas did list the brokerage fee on my order (it was  $3.50) and it's on the website for my last order.  It could simply be that everything I ordered was covered under NAFTA so I did not have to pay any duty.  There were times that I did have to pay the postman for taxes, but those were orders from Jammin Jigs or some other small shop.  Anyway, just my personal experience with about six $50 to $250 orders from BPS(2) and Cabelas(4).  So, not much experience there.  Regardless, it won't be much to be overly concerned with unless you ordered $1000's in lures from Lucky Craft."
456286,Governator,2010-04-15 13:04:00,879,"Picked up my bass pro wally marshall series rod/reel last night from Canada Post.  Never had an UL before, should be fun for the pannies.  It's 5'6 one piece and there was no additional charges."
458151,TC1OZ,2010-04-20 16:13:00,987,My original order was for $107.  My credit card was charged for $115.  The difference was the GST/PST & Duty.  They make the adjustment before they ship it. I believe if its a considerable amount they will call you before processing the order.  Not sure why everyone has so many horror stories. The process is exactly the same if I were to order it express.  There will be no fees when my package arrives tomorrow.  
458236,ctdd2006,2010-04-20 20:43:00,531,I wouldn't be so sure about no add'l fees!?  Good Luck.   They got me (me wife as it was a gift) on a hummingbird gps/fishfinder.  I think I paid $70 or so dollars for my gift when the man in brown or red and blue showed up!  Check your math on GST/PST on $107....certainly more than 8 bucks!  I really do hope you get it for $115 all in!  Let us know.  Kevin
458253,TC1OZ,2010-04-20 21:27:00,987,  I did. I believe they only charge GST (not PST as it was not sold in our province) and the duties are only charged on items that are not considered as NAFTA items.
455820,TC1OZ,2010-04-14 14:17:00,987,"Hello all.  I am about to put my credit card in for an order off of basspro.com and was wondering....  Looks like I might possibly be charged duties... any one have experience with this? My order comes to a total of $101, 20$ shipping, 6$ extra shipping for the rod. Then I found a coupon for $20 off when you order over 100$ (coupon code = save20a)  Go for it or just make the trip to the store?"
455821,Sudzy,2010-04-14 14:21:00,88,"You probably will be charged duty.  Just have to weigh the cost of shipping ,duty as well as your coupon code against the costs of gas/time driving down to the store and see what works out better."
455822,lookinforwalleye,2010-04-14 14:24:00,4399,BPS has a store in Buffalo don`t they? How far is Buffalo from Fort Erie.  Canuck Buck is par!!!
455824,TC1OZ,2010-04-14 14:26:00,987,  I just thought of that after I posted lol.  I'm basically paying 6$ for the shipping as the coupon code covers the cost of shipping. Sure as hell beats driving.  And the items I'm getting are a great deal!  Do I have to pay cash on delivery for the duties? Or how does that work?
455825,lookinforwalleye,2010-04-14 14:27:00,4399,"No store in Buffalo yet,future store!"
455827,TC1OZ,2010-04-14 14:29:00,987," Passports expired (75$ to renew) and I don't have the enhanced license upgrade (45$). So I can't enter the US right now hahaha.  As for the buck at par mastercard always has a great exchange rate!  So the nearest Canadian store is quite the hike, and they may not have everything I ordered! (as I pretty much ordered everything off the clearance page...)  Bait casting combo.. spinnners, buzz baits, top water, and some plastics."
455832,GBW,2010-04-14 14:33:00,8460,"Yes, COD when they come to your door."
455836,TC1OZ,2010-04-14 14:40:00,987,"  I remember a long time ago I ordered a leather jacket for a friend off ebay, and the brokerage fee on it was just as much as the order.... Is something like that going to happen here?"
455838,spooner_jr,2010-04-14 14:41:00,193,"I don't think you are charged duty, at least I haven't been.  They do collect the gst and pst on delivery."
455839,MCTFisher9120,2010-04-14 14:43:00,3761,"Not to sure with the rod but I've bought many items there(usually lures and terminal tackle) and have had to pay not 1 cent at the door. I pay online and it arrives.  Again, might be different with a 1-pc rod but ordering tackle has never been a issue with me"
455847,Governator,2010-04-14 15:00:00,879,"I ordered a 1 piece ultralite rod last week (my first online purchase from bass pro), I guess when it arrives I'll let ya know.  It was shipped friday."
455851,scugpg,2010-04-14 15:04:00,1373,Surprised BPS doesn't put in duties automatically. I know Cabelas and iboats.com do.
455856,Fang,2010-04-14 15:12:00,1330,From my BPS experience it's hit and miss. Most of the time with reels and lures I don't get duty charges. Last rod order from the states was with Albright and I think the size of the rod tube got that order hit. I ordered some reels from them a few weeks later at a higher $ value and it sailed through with no duty.  I always consider duty as a convenience fee for not having to get dressed and got out to a store.

I am fairly new to fishing and I cant afford a huge investment, so save the comments on how garbage the rod and reel probably are . Its my first bait caster and it looks the same quality as the crestfire combo they want $149 for at walmart. So getting all those baits and a rod+reel for less than what I would pay at Walmart...its a good deal I think?  I think this shopping excursion will set me up great for this years fishing tournament. Hoping to add some big numbers for the Bass and Pike come cottage time . Hell maybe even a muskie if I'm lucky   Now the waiting game...."
455863,TC1OZ,2010-04-14 15:35:00,987," And the fact that I spent the last hour browsing the fresh water fishing section of the basspro.com website while getting paid to ""work""."
455867,GBW,2010-04-14 15:45:00,8460,And don't forget the time well spent here too...
455869,TC1OZ,2010-04-14 15:53:00,987," Between this board and my local board... I don't know how I get any work done hahahahaha.  Good thing those tim hortons ladies don't actually call me with real technical issues   **EDIT***   Just realized the bait caster alone (item#38-360-724-00) on the website is $69.99, came up as $43.37 as part of the combo.  Rod (item#38-130-096-00) $34.99 on its own, came up as $16.56   So the rod and reel purchased separately off the website (currently stocked items) would be a total of $104.98  Those items combo-ed (item#38-952-142-09)  are in the clearance section for $59.94  Add all that gear and its still less than the rod and reel!!! Now that's a deal!"
455943,Governator,2010-04-14 18:17:00,879,Just got the slip that my package is in at Canada Post.  Will pick up after work and let you know if I have to pay duties (It's a rod/reel).
455947,TC1OZ,2010-04-14 18:19:00,987,  Exciting! I'm hoping some of my buzz baits will get me into some monster largies like your profile pic!  You always post the best large mouth pics! lol.
455950,Terry,2010-04-14 18:40:00,14456,"first there is no duty on most things from BPS that is what free trade with the USA s about, however you do have to pay gst .once HST comes into play you pay it..  if you have UPS shipping it they will act as your broker and charge you a broker fee that can be a few bucks or up to 3/4 of the cost of what you order, I think they have a big wheel they spin to decide how much to charge on each shipment"
455952,bdox,2010-04-14 18:42:00,329,"What you order depends on if you're charged duty/taxes. If you order a Loomis or St. Croix rod or something that is made in the states, there is no duty. Falls under NAFTA. Last week I ordered $350 worth of stuff (Chronarch D7 and some Lucky Craft jerks, all made in Japan) and got an email from customer service the next day asking me to authorize an additional $30 for duties/taxes. I was told BPS uses Russell A. Farrow Ltd for brokerage across the boarder. My visa wasn't charged until I authorized the additional charges.  I'm pretty sure this is only for items that are either made or assembled in the North America."
455958,TC1OZ,2010-04-14 19:07:00,987,"  hahaha I have no idea how they are shipping it. I just chose standard which says 3-6 business days. I'm hoping its just coming Canada post like Governators order. I have no qualms paying the GST its that brokerage fee that kills me!  I believe the free trade only applies if the item was made in the USA (or NAFTA country). So if the item was imported from china for sale in the US, then sold in Canada... I believe it would be charged duties."
455959,TC1OZ,2010-04-14 19:08:00,987," This is exactly what I wanted to hear!!!  I tried the online support, they just copied and pasted the website which clears up nothing! hahaha.  Thanks man! Love all the great help!"
455971,adempsey,2010-04-14 19:45:00,1498,"When I ordered from BPS or Cabelas I am fairly certain it was all charged to my CC immediately (shipping, taxes, brokerage fee) and never had to pay anything COD.  I always use USPS to avoid costly brokerage fees.  Cabelas lost my order twice though, but replaced it without question.  NAFTA would cover most things made in USA, Canada or Mexico."
456019,TC1OZ,2010-04-14 21:20:00,987, Basspro.com website says who they use for brokerage and it says fee's are calculated when the items are actually packaged for shipping. As a web designer I know how impossible it would be to integrate charging the exact brokerage fees for certain items and not others (due to origin of manufacturer). By the wording of the statement I assume maybe they used to charge a flat fee regardless if it was one item or more? Perhaps that's what Cabela's does?  I can promise you this information is current as I made the post before ordering and have learned more about the process since ordering.
