There are pictures in my temporary internet folder that don't show up when I look for them with Windows explorer, but they are definitley there as they appear in my digital camera viewing software.  Also, there is a cookie in there that I can't delete.  Any ideas or websites to reccomnend so that I can get rid of this?  There doesn't appaer to be any slow down of the machine, but I just want to get rid of these rather unsavory images.  Thanks."

Just uncheck the things you don't want deleted. I just delete everything in the CCleaner list.  muddler"
457661,jackal68,2010-04-19 01:17:00,68,hey dutch go to Avast! Download their home program. My brother in Law is one of the top guys at Globe and Mail on line. (oversee a pile of websites like tsn) and he told me to use it it is the best for a home outfit. Never had a virus it couldnt translate
457673,The JAY,2010-04-19 02:00:00,239,"Well, I can't say anything about Avast!, but I can recommend AVG free Download. It's all I've ever used, and all I ever install on folks machines when they bring them to me. You could also run the Trend Housecall online scanner. Both are very good, and free...."
457674,BillM,2010-04-19 02:05:00,17367,Avasti + Malwarebytes Anti mailware will take care of pretty much everything.

457698,bigfish1965,2010-04-19 02:37:00,3382,"Avira is the top rated anti-virus (free) out there. I doubt you have a virus, just orphaned shortcuts or unusual picture locations, Use Gleary Utitilies or CCleaner."
457701,Mykester,2010-04-19 02:56:00,241,"If you don't want to download anything, run this online virus scanner. It has worked for me in the past.  http://housecall.trendmicro.com/  Be sure to run it in IE though, it won't work on Firefox if I'm correct. It's a good scanner, whatever you can't remove you can find a special program to remove a specific trojan/virus/worm that Trend Micro will detect.  From the anti virus scanner suggested above, go with Avast, I've never used Avira but Avast constantly updates and its been good for me. AVG is overrated."

457709,bigfish1965,2010-04-19 03:20:00,3382, Reformating for some pic errors and a stubborn cookies is a tad extreme
457850,mpt,2010-04-19 17:22:00,158,spybot is also good.
457854,Paully,2010-04-19 17:41:00,712,Stick to fish porn and you'll never have these kinds of problems..
457951,Dutch,2010-04-19 22:36:00,831,"No porn, other than fish porn for me fellas.  I think I got everything cleaned up - useed CCCleaner and this was a help too:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxloLZQVZIs  Thanks for the suggestions."
