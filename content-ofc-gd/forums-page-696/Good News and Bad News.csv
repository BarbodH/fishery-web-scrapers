458133,LeXXington,2010-04-20 15:25:00,1928,Congrats Roger
458140,misfish,2010-04-20 15:55:00,29133,Atleast I still got Steve to talk to there.LOL  Good on ya Rog.FW is getting a great guy and also one that knows the buss.
458159,tightline,2010-04-20 16:34:00,322,Way to go Roger..Sounds like your fitting right in at FW..Congrats
458160,Headhunter,2010-04-20 16:39:00,5703,"Well, I for one am gonna miss seeing you at BPS! My wife still comments years later what a great smile you have and how wonderful you are to anyone who meets you. The folks at FW have gained more than just another sale associate, they have all gained a great person and I'm sure a friend. Good luck to yah Roger and if I ever get to FW, I'll be sure to say hi! HH"
458187,Rattletrap2,2010-04-20 17:39:00,1652,"Congratulations Roger! I know working for BPS was always on your ""bucket list"" and know you loved it there. I never really could understand how you made the drive from Grimsby to Vaughn for 5 1/2 years though. Must have been brutal! I make the drive every now and again from where i live and find it a long way....(ok, maybe not as long a drive as it is for Roy, but long enough for me!).  Fishing World is fortunate to get you!  Enjoy!"
458240,Lunatic,2010-04-20 20:55:00,536,"I hope you have a better attitude then those kids that work there. everytime i ask a question i get 2 different answers or i get ""ya"" or ""no""  are you getting any more power pro in soon? ya .......ok when? dunno,soon.  the older guys there are great. dont care for the younger guys."
458297,Ron,2010-04-21 00:05:00,1683,"Oh Man!....  It isn't often I get down Hammer town way. One person's loss is another person's gain. I can guarantee you this was my loss.  I always looked forward to the conversations we had in the isles. I don't think FW has realized just yet how much of an asset they have gained by having you on their team.  Good for you Roger!  Hey, I now have an even bigger reason other than Spiel (sucking up)  to come and visit the Hammer.  Cheers, Ron...."
458306,Radnine,2010-04-21 00:23:00,1538,  PM sent Jim
458416,bpsbassman,2010-04-21 13:04:00,941,"Thank you everyone for all the kind comments.  I do hope that I will see many of you (and many that I haven't met yet) in the store. Blake's right, I am ""slowly"" coming up to speed, but this old body can't even keep up to Blake with a bad back!! I always knew the store was busy, but have been very pleasantly surprised at just how busy it is!!  They do have many, many great deals!!  Wayne's comments were too funny.  Don't worry, the earth won't stop spinning Wayne.  I'm still a BPS Groupie!!  I still have 26 of the 52 stores to get to!!! The only problem is that I won't be getting discount on the 26 T-Shirts!!  Lew, you'll have to bring Diane down South to the Hammer,  lots of hugs still waiting  Ron, I too will miss our conversations,  unless of course you make our way to Fishing World.  We've got a pretty good selection of Musky tackle and maybe a few that you haven't seen"
457676,bpsbassman,2010-04-19 02:08:00,941,"First, the Bad News.â€¦.............................. After 5 1/2 years at Bass Pro Shops, I handed in my resignation. My last day was April 8, 2010.  It was a great run, from greeting the first customer in the door in November of 2004 right up until this year's Spring Classic that just ended.  I have made many new friends and acquaintances, many that will last a lifetime, and met many great OFNers over the years, but it is now time to move on. The job has been a blast, but the one hour plus drive each way finally wore me down.  My heart wanted me to stay, but my head said that it just didn't make any sense. Thanks for all the wonderful experiences Bass Pro, but it is time to move on.  And now for the GOOD NEWS!! My new employer will be......................... | | | | v | | | | v | | | | v | | | | v Are you ready??????? | | | | v | | | | v | | | | v | | | | v Fishing World!!!!  Yeehaaa!  I met with Jim and Mike and am really excited about my new adventure!!! Looking forward to working with Blake, Steve, Nick and all the rest of the great staff in the store! Come on in and say hi (and buy some great merchandise). Maybe now I'll get a chance to start posting more often!"
457681,TC1OZ,2010-04-19 02:13:00,987,Congrats!   It's always exciting starting something new!
457684,purekgw,2010-04-19 02:16:00,585,was at fishing world the other day they had a bunch of cotton cordells on sale 3 for $10
457685,The JAY,2010-04-19 02:18:00,239,"Well, the commute will be way easier on you, that's for sure! Congrats! I love that old Pop Shoppe building..."
457687,Beans,2010-04-19 02:19:00,3339,Hey Roger...I guess if'n you got to work for a livin' that's a good way to do it...  Me...I'll stick to retirement...the pay is no hell but you can't beat the hours..  Best of luck in your new endeavor...
457689,irishfield,2010-04-19 02:20:00,26272,Man.. the earth just might stop spinning.  THE BPS Groupie calls it quits....
457690,Dondorfish,2010-04-19 02:23:00,1000,Hey Congrats Roger - BPS's loss is definately Fishing World's gain. Will stop into see you one of these days.  Don
457692,bpsbassman,2010-04-19 02:25:00,941, Lots of Laughs Wayne!!!  Still a little hard to believe Not sure what to do with my 50+ BPS T-Shirts!! I have nothing bad to say about BPS especially my co-workers (and customers).  Its what kept me going all these years. I must say though that I'm genuinely excited about working at FW.  I've always loved the store.
457695,Joey,2010-04-19 02:36:00,9122,Congrats on the new job Roger.  I'll make sure to some visit you at your new employment home  BPS won't be the same without you tho  Joey
457696,John Bacon,2010-04-19 02:36:00,3277, What about your handle... will you be FWBASSMAN next week? ;-)
457700,bpsbassman,2010-04-19 02:47:00,941," With Jim and Mike, 2001 & 2003 CFT Team of the Year for starters    and probably two of the best Bass Fishermen in this country  :worthy: and guys like Blake and Steve in the store, I'm embarrassed to have my BASSMAN licence plates on my van. No way I could use the FWBASSMAN handle. Think I'll stick with my current handle"
457702,GBW,2010-04-19 02:57:00,8460,"Maybe ""Roger=Bass"" or ""Rojer@FW"" then?  Either way, cheers and enjoy!"
457706,mbac31,2010-04-19 03:12:00,904,"Got a chance to talk to you today Roger. Fishingworld is my favorite store. Jim , Mike, and especially Blake are great people. Looking forward to dealing with you there now for sure."
457735,Big Cliff,2010-04-19 07:46:00,6899,Really happy for you! Good luck in your new venture.
457736,lew,2010-04-19 08:42:00,12766,"Best of luck in the new job my friend, BPS is losing a great asset.  I spose now that Diane won't be getting her hugs anymore, she won't bother joining me on my annual Christmas shopping trip to the store again"
457744,Spiel,2010-04-19 10:30:00,9065,Well this is good news as I frequent FW and thus will finally get to meet you Roger.
457750,solopaddler,2010-04-19 11:13:00,8605,"Good move, that commute must have been murder.  I'm in there fairly regularly, looking forward to meeting you."
457751,Roy,2010-04-19 11:17:00,13728,"Sure, it's closer for you but it adds an hour to my six and a half hour drive for my yearly visit.  Best of luck to you Roger......you're surely a credit to anyone fortunate enough to have you on their team."
457752,pikehunter,2010-04-19 11:19:00,1659,Good for you Roger! That drive must have been horrendous to BPS. I just turned a great job offer down because I didn't want to do the drive from Hamilton to the Vaughan area daily at rush hour.  So business will pick up at Fishing World now with everyone dropping in to see you. Wise decision on F.World's behalf.
457799,Mike Pike,2010-04-19 15:30:00,1332,Hey Congratulations Roger!  I'll be sure to introduce myself next time I'm in the store. I'll be the guy who comes in to do more talkin' than buyin'!  lol
457802,TJQ,2010-04-19 15:32:00,7806,Congrats Roger!!
457811,Tybo,2010-04-19 15:51:00,1373,What. No more stuff being pushed through the back door. Best of luck to you Roger.
457992,John,2010-04-19 23:52:00,2956,Congrat's Roger. Will stop by for a chat.
458001,vinnimon,2010-04-20 00:36:00,2593,"Congrates man, I hope to see you there on my next visit.I love chatting with the 5 am chap on the weekends.Hes a hoot!lol"
458124,Blake,2010-04-20 14:40:00,418,"Well I know that when I found out Roger was going to be working with us at Fishing World I thought what a great asset and good, genuine person to work with.  I always thought it was funny when Roger would come in to the store and bring his 4 or 5 buddies in for a shopping spree. We would chat and he would say that Fishing World had a great selection and I would say hey you shop here you might aswell work here as a joke  So far Roger is adapting well and is apart of the FW Team.  Welcome buddy and here's too many tears of working together.  For all the OFC'ers please drop by and show Roger support and give him more time to talk than work"
