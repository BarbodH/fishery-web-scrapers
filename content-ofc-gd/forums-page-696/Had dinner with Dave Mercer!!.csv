453241,TJQ,2010-04-08 00:18:00,7806, LOL.. thats funny.
453247,TC1OZ,2010-04-08 00:26:00,987,"lol TJ, I'm going searching for Dave in St. Catharines tomorrow."
453248,Daplumma,2010-04-08 00:29:00,1961,That would be cool.I think that everyone here should try to get a pic of them and Dave with an OFC hat on.Maybe a random drawing to win something for those who enter their pic.Gerrit...no teabag pics. Joe
453257,misfish,2010-04-08 00:41:00,29133,"  I have a 5 dollar ft long three times a week.So good.   I was wondering though ,why  are they trying to make him look like Carwin?"
453258,aplumma,2010-04-08 00:42:00,6896,It seems Dave needs to eat a little more he looks kind of thin from the side. If you decide to take Joe up on his idea I think the Southern Contingency should be entered automatically.   Art
453259,Ron,2010-04-08 00:42:00,1683,"Geesh, I never realized how SHORT Dave Mercer is!"

453265,vinnimon,2010-04-08 00:50:00,2593,Oh! and the kids praying in front of him.
453266,danbouck,2010-04-08 00:54:00,4380,"A blind man once stepped on Dave Mercer's shoe. Dave replied, ""Don't you know who I am? I'm Dave Mercer!"" The mere mention of his name cured this man blindness. Sadly the first, last, and only thing this man ever saw, was a fatal roundhouse delivered by Dave Mercer."
453276,misfish,2010-04-08 01:12:00,29133,Dave cant move that fast.LOL
453330,Dave Mercer,2010-04-08 02:30:00,148,Sounds like a great contest guys! Here is what we will do for each person that posts a picture on here with them and my Subway cutout.

453392,Lunatic,2010-04-08 03:37:00,536,"Seems like a boring dinner,it looks like all he talked about was his boat"
453420,Moosebunk,2010-04-08 04:28:00,3970,"Rick's cooler than Jared, but I wouldn't say he's a better poster boy for the Subway diet. Haha!!!"
453457,vinnimon,2010-04-08 06:33:00,2593,"Well dave, All I have is an OFC mug and a facts of fishing shirt so far.Ill figure something out,should be fun though.MMMMMMMMM subway.Your boat, my driveway."
