457892,Slimeball,2010-04-19 19:42:00,30,"Riverview and Wajushk would be good choices as Randy stated. Keep in mind Riverview is a very busy Marina also. I stay at Lunge Lodge which is in sight of Wajushk, the price is right and they are very accomadating. Chaudiere Lodge which has a new owner this year is just across from Wajushk is a nice lodge but their a little pricey. French River Lodge on the Lower French has nice clean cabins and are pretty cheap, they are housekeeping only though..."
