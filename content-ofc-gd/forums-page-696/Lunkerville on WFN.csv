458220,Mykester,2010-04-20 19:09:00,241,"Wouldn't it be illegal in the sense that by rehooking it on a different line, you are using it as bait, which is illegal considering that bass are game fish? Sure, there's no ""intention"" but the way that it's been presented it can pass as being used as bait."
458223,TC1OZ,2010-04-20 19:16:00,987," Exactly... My moms boyfriend had a CO hassle him for a license when he was casting a barbie rod for my very young cousin (who is not physically able to cast a rod). He had one but he gave the CO a hard time as to why he had to show it (especially consdering the circumstances). And trust me the laws CO's enforce are written the same way the laws the Police enforce are written... to interpretation. He was basically told if he put bait on the hook, helped tie the hook, or cast for someone... you need a license.  Good point Mykester."

458232,kickingfrog,2010-04-20 20:15:00,8333,"Many states have much different rules then what some of us might be used to. Many are more liberal, some are not. Where was he fishing?"
458254,walleyejigger,2010-04-20 21:27:00,876,"maybe u should of worded it different, you shouldn't be asking ppl to prove that it's legal, instead, yourself proving it's illegal,  u keep stating you dont have a problem with it, but insist ""SOMEONE"" should have a problem,  the spoon in your pot is getting worn very quickly"
458259,TC1OZ,2010-04-20 21:38:00,987, Maybe I worded it horribly wrong...  I'm not going to lie I was at work and made the post while doing technical support haha.
458264,Handlebarz,2010-04-20 22:01:00,3790,I think the reason for some of the replies is that other shows have done this to fool people to think they know what they are doing but on the truly hard days there guides did not get them on fish so they do what they have to to get the show in the can. With Mike his show is about him not knowing a thing and it sounds like he played it like (heck I and getting out fished by a kid WHAT THE) then he did what he did as a joke on himself.  I don't know where he was fishing but there might not be a law on that as stated by others they have some different ways of doing things down south of us just look at them they let Glen fish with out a shirt and then tell about it now that is just wrong

458158,TC1OZ,2010-04-20 16:32:00,987,"Just wanted to stir up some conversation.. as I know how much of a problem some of you guys have with this situation..   The episode was the ""family fishing"" episode and he was out fishing for little pan fish with his daughter.  The host was fishing with his wife and daughter at the top of this small waterfall. The wife was razzing him about not catching anything. His daughter catches a little bass, and being a little girl he takes it off the hook for her.  He then turns into himself and re-hooks the fish on his line, tosses the fish back to the bottom of the waterfall and ""pretends to catch it"". Now I know this was all in good fun and I'm really not offended by it.   But isn't that illegal?   Discuss..."
458165,darsky,2010-04-20 16:49:00,586,yaaawwwwwwwwwwwwwwnnnnnnnnnnnnn
458167,TC1OZ,2010-04-20 16:50:00,987, Tired?
458168,Mykester,2010-04-20 16:54:00,241,I remember seeing something on the Food network where they were catching sturgeon at Algonquin and then took one home and prepared it. I thought sturgeon were closed year round?
458170,danbouck,2010-04-20 16:57:00,4380,"  Mike is a member here, send him a PM"
458180,TC1OZ,2010-04-20 17:17:00,987,"  I have no problem with it, thus I'm not going to send him a PM.  But I was just wondering isn't this technically the same as snagging a fish, re-hooking it, and pretending you caught it?"
458182,brifishrgy,2010-04-20 17:27:00,559, no its not the same as snagging a fish
458184,TC1OZ,2010-04-20 17:32:00,987," Well the fish was legally caught. Unhooked. Re-hooked on a different line. Thrown back in the water. And reeled back in.  Not exactly the same.  Looks like I made a bad post...  But am I wrong on this being illegal or not?  Correct me if I'm wrong, don't just tell me I'm wrong. Tell me why."
458188,John,2010-04-20 17:43:00,2956," I think in this case the operative words are ""stir up""......"
458190,TC1OZ,2010-04-20 17:45:00,987,  I haven't seen GCD around in the last couple of weeks.. Figure someones gotta stir the pot.
458192,John,2010-04-20 17:48:00,2956, And you see what happened to Glenn!
458194,brifishrgy,2010-04-20 17:52:00,559," the fish was caught legally, what was done after doesn't matter, some throw them back and some throw them in livewells or tow them on stringers for hours till they decide to kill them. as long as it was legally caught there was nothing wrong with what he did."
458196,TC1OZ,2010-04-20 17:54:00,987, I hope you never run into a CO. They are a little more firm on the rules.
458199,TC1OZ,2010-04-20 18:00:00,987,Sorry for this post... Didn't know I was going to ruffle feathers.    I just like discussing the laws that we live by.    Technically the fish was not caught by angling methods which is illegal. I was pretty shocked seeing this on TV. I guess we can turn a blind eye to some things.
458201,fish-miester,2010-04-20 18:06:00,864,dont you just love this forum for that.. you post a question and you get all kind of replies.. saying basically how your dumb for asking questions..  now I didnt see this episode.. but im sure if I did I would probably post the same question... and well I dont have an answer to give you.. but I guess the fish is a part of his limit.. though I am no CO.. so ..
458202,brifishrgy,2010-04-20 18:06:00,559,so what rule did he break then
458204,fish-miester,2010-04-20 18:13:00,864,  he doesnt know.. hence why he made this topic..
458205,Mykester,2010-04-20 18:15:00,241,"What he did was wrong and while I don't know if it's illegal, he should be frowned upon as doing that only decreases the fishes chance of survival, unless he was keeping a baby bass?"
458206,DanD,2010-04-20 18:16:00,2223,"Too bad Italo wasnt a member here; hed probably answer this question, from first hand knowledge. LOL  Dan."
458207,ehg,2010-04-20 18:16:00,2666,"Wow, wouldn't wanna bring you fishing with the kids. They would all be scared you would phone the cops or CO's or something."
458209,TC1OZ,2010-04-20 18:18:00,987,"  HAHAHA Thanks.  Finally someone who just answered the damn question.  I'm not sure either... Thus why I asked.  I just know that its illegal to pick a fish out of water with your hands, not sure what the rules are on re-hooking a fish on a different line and throwing it back in the water/reeling it in are....   I only posted this because I know how hard core some people are on this forum... ripping on people for throwing the fish back in rather than releasing them with care... or for keeping it out of the water for too long. But when someone on TV re-hooks a fish and huffs it back into the water attached to a hook and reels it back in....no big deal.  (To me it is no big deal, but some of the hardcore people should have a problem with this.)"
458210,ehg,2010-04-20 18:21:00,2666,again...
458212,Raf,2010-04-20 18:24:00,3495,
458216,fish-miester,2010-04-20 18:50:00,864,wow.. TC10Z Im with ya on this one.. one day people are freaking on people for dropping a fish into the water from to high up.. the next day they could give a crap.. must just be that its a beauty day and they are stuck at work so there a little grumpy..
458219,TC1OZ,2010-04-20 19:07:00,987," He didn't keep it. After he pretended to catch it again he just tossed it back in. Not sure if its illegal thus why I made the topic and put a ""?"" after the illegal fishing... I guess people are missing the point of my post and assuming I'm trying to flame this guy... Just wondering if what he did was right... doesn't seem right to me. Even if its not illegal he didn't show the fish any respect. A 4 inch bass deserves as much respect as a 42"" musky in my opinion.   Funny enough he was a good 4 feet above the water he toss the hooked fish back into, plus his height. I actually watched this episode on my lunch break at work and thought to myself... Man I bet people on OFC would rip this guy a new   if they saw what he was doing here...   ---------------------  I could care less, I'd do the same. I just posed the question if this was illegal or not. I know there are some hard core naturalists/conservationists who would take offense to this kind of action. And the fact that its not just some random guy.. this guy is on TV setting the example for anyone watching. Is that how you treat a fish?"
