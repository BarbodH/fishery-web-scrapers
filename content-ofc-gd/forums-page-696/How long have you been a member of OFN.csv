457557,ehg,2010-04-18 21:14:00,2666,Have been here long enough to remember Irishfield's first post
457576,Terry,2010-04-18 22:12:00,14456,long enough to name all these guys

457727,Sinker,2010-04-19 04:33:00,8692,I'm not sure myself. Somewhere around '02-'03. I coudn't even turn a cmputer on until then LOL.  I wonder who the first ten members were?  S.
457729,Gerritt,2010-04-19 04:43:00,6129,Well my son passed in 2002... (an important time marker for me) and was a member for a year or two before that...I think I was a member before he was born in 2000 infact..  Been here along time.... and have had one hell of a ride.  If I got paid for the hours wasted on OFC.. I would be richer then Bill Gates by now.  I rarely post fishing reports anymore due to the flack received in the past.. But there is NO other place I would rather be to shoot the crap amoungst friends.  Ohhh and my answer is common carp.  G
457961,Leecher,2010-04-19 22:55:00,7832," Well for me, going on my second year in July    It's safe to say that I'm still a newbie around here considering others that posted.  Leechman"
457049,Roy,2010-04-17 12:57:00,13728,"Yeah...I've been around a while too. Canadave and I go back a long way. His dad used to walk us to school.....he had no choice, he was in the same grade as we were."
457051,Roy,2010-04-17 13:00:00,13728," Who remembers the first pic in that spread? HINT: there was a dog in the picture.  And yes, I will forever be grateful to Brian for bringing Joey here."
457055,Terry,2010-04-17 13:10:00,14456,"was the dog in an inflatable boat?    <a href=""http://s25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/?action=view&current=all1.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/all1.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>"

457067,Carp,2010-04-17 14:17:00,1488,"Been here quite a while. Since '01 / '02 I think. Yes, many of the above mentioned names, and those not to be mentioned, are familiar to me. First fishing site I ever joined and still the one I most often frequent. Met many great people here, both online and in person.  Thanks TJ."
457069,Spiel,2010-04-17 14:21:00,9065,  What's todays date?
457074,Roy,2010-04-17 14:38:00,13728," Here on OFC we say ""Who's today's date."""
457082,Marty,2010-04-17 14:53:00,873,"I've often thought about Crudd.   Wonder what he's up to.  I was around for the original board. Some guy calling himself Muskiestudd helped me develop the muskie bug on the Upper French.    So many  upgrades I can't remember but I do remember the original board.   The funniest part was that ""he who has not been named"" won TJ's first ever contest, an all expense paid fishing trip.  That one burns.   There are very few names still here from the early days, mostly because there werent' many members at all.    It has been great fun watching this board grow and becoming such good friends with so many people from Canada. You know who you are.  My 7 year old son has explained to me that he is moving to Canada when he's old enough.   I just hope he has space for me in the boat.   Thanks guys.  Despite some of the crap over the years, this place is truly remarkable.  I miss Canadave.  He is truly one of a kind.  Terry, where's the last supper?"
457090,johnnyb,2010-04-17 15:06:00,3413,"Well my son just turned 10, and I remember discovering the board around the time he was crawling around on the floor....I remember AndyK's solo reports, and Canadave.  Over the years I would move, forget my login info, have to restart...but it's all good  "
457092,Spiel,2010-04-17 15:12:00,9065,"If I remember correctly Canadave had two rods, a brown one and a black one."
457093,Roy,2010-04-17 15:15:00,13728, His claim to fame was that he had used the urinal next to the one that Gord Sinclair had used at the CFRB studios. You gotta love that sense of humour. God bless him.
457100,jjcanoe,2010-04-17 15:59:00,744,"I'm not quite sure if this is the evolution of the old Zoo board but that was the first fishing board I was a memeber of.   Lost touch a bit for half a year or so around mid 2000 when I started trucking, when I returned to regular net use I was here, and have managed to hang around ever since.  Nov 16, 2006 was the day they made everyone rejoin again.  I do remember that!  jjcanoe"
457101,Beans,2010-04-17 16:00:00,3339, Sorry 'bout that Chief !!!  My memory is not much better...I know it was 28 December 2002 (I keep old calanders)that I met Big Cliff in living colour up at Airport Road to go icefishing so I joined OFC well before that...actually...I got an e-mail from Mikeo inviting me to the 2nd Lakair M&G so it must have been early 2002...  Met Jack and Jackie in person on the 16th September 2002 at Tim Horton's in Lindsay...He had a tin of pork and beans on the roof of his vehicle for identifiaction purposes...we had been corresponding via e-mail since way back in our Bill Dance fishing board days...  I was made aware of OFC from the old Simcoe board when I had a Kawartha Lakes question...
457191,bucktail,2010-04-17 21:24:00,1857,God I cant remember now. I guess its been almost 10 years! wow I am feeling old now
457192,Skud,2010-04-17 21:27:00,739,I joined about three or four months before the first Lakair get together. When did that happen?

457318,Squid,2010-04-18 02:38:00,1656,So nice to see some of the  old goats come out and post on this thread. Yeah we have lost some good people and some not so good who will remain unnamed. I believe that the board just celebrated its 10 th anniversary just a while back. Lets hear from some of the newer members on this board.
457337,Joey,2010-04-18 03:19:00,9122,Guess it was 2002 for me.  Went to the second Lakair G2G a bit intimidated to meet people off the *gasp* internet  Joey
457339,skeeter,2010-04-18 03:29:00,1907,then joey met roy and realized what they said about the internet was true
457383,Bear,2010-04-18 11:55:00,106,been so long I remember recieving a OFC hat in the mail ...... I think just for signing up
457396,Garry2Rs,2010-04-18 12:24:00,1425,"It was about 2000 or 2001 that I found this board.  I had been reading the Zoo board, but all I remember about them was they were always fighting...grin. When I came on board every Monday AndyK was writing about his adventures over the weekend.  He was so honest about his faux pas and, with his somewhat broken English, I would laugh until tears ran down my face! I still see Andy and hear from Mikeo and Canadave... Ah Yes! ""Those were the days my friend..."""
457410,Handlebarz,2010-04-18 13:08:00,3790,Been around 8-9 years ago it was when I had broken my foot and was off work I had found many sites but this is the only one that I am still a member (other then Ebay) I have made many great friends here over the years.  Thanks to all who keep this place going and the life long friends I have made here.
456749,Squid,2010-04-16 16:25:00,1656,Just curious on the demographics of the members here on the board. How long have you been a member?
456751,pikehunter,2010-04-16 16:33:00,1659,"Prop all total 6-8, maybe even 9? Never updated post counts or other stats when the board made changes so I've lost track."
456752,Raf,2010-04-16 16:35:00,3495,ya left out 0-1.
456756,Roy,2010-04-16 16:42:00,13728,"I don't know what the goal of this poll is...I can give you some pretty accurate numbers though. Almost 50% of our membership have been here 2 years or less. That is to say that they registered April 15, 08 or later."

456866,camillj,2010-04-16 21:34:00,1988,why ?  Whos askin ... is there some new kind of OFC Tax being considered ?  
456868,Ron,2010-04-16 21:37:00,1683,"I remember the very original board.  TJ was the only person who registered with his real name. Even then we thought it was a nick name! Gone are the days of Canadave, what's his name and BFI. Those were the few I remember. Out of those 3 Canadave was the greatest one. He stuck around for a long time. BFI was around for only a year, maybe 2. what's his name had to be the most colorful though. He could fly off the handle in a heart beat! There have been many that have move on from the original board. Some tried to start up their own board, often replicated but never duplicated. It is nice to see the board grow as it did.  It's nice to see every once in a while boards names from people of the past too. One that reminded me of the ""good ol days"" recently was musky man. I hadn't seen his name on here for a long long time. Nice to know you are still around!  LMAO!!! What's his name!!! gota like it! ha ha ha"
456869,Terry,2010-04-16 21:39:00,14456,I've been a member so long our computers only had punch cards and we had to mail the cards to each other to communicate
456889,Jer,2010-04-16 22:28:00,1426,"I got my first computer in 2001, so it must have been shortly after that.  Right off the bat there was something different about this site. I've never been a huge post contributor, but I bet there haven't been many days in those 9 years that I haven't checked the board at least once."

456922,Bob,2010-04-17 00:25:00,370,It's been years.  I don't know.  I'd have to ask if there are still records that go back that far.  I remember Canadave and he whose name mustn't be mentioned.  I believe it was the original board I signed up on.  I remember a frequent contributor photo spread that really wasn't very large.  I've always used my own name. Is the old photo page still around?  Anyone have it saved?  It would be fun to see it again.

I brought Misfish over here....and I think he brought Joey over from another site.....so does that count for anything? LOL"
