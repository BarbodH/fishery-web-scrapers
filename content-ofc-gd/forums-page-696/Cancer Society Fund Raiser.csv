They are doing a fund raiser for Cancer and have a goal of only $300.00. Anybody out there willing to help? I think this horrible disease has touched all of us at some point. Anything you might want to give...(no matter how small) would be greatly appreciated. Thanks a lot For checking this out. Happy fishing!!!

She heard about it and said whe wanted to do it. This last nine months a ittle neighbourhood boy of 4 has been fighting luekemia. The great news, thanks to programs like this, and the funds they raise he has beat it and looks to have a full life ahead of him  As for my daughter - right after her last cut she declared she was going to do it again.  donation done. Way to go girls!"

457851,irishfield,2010-04-19 17:30:00,26272,"Okay.. they're now over the top of their goal, but it doesn't mean that you/we can't keep giving. It would be hard to believe that nobody here hasn't been touched by this disease and no matter where/to whom you give it goes to the same cause... to find a way to defeat it!  I lost my father to Cancer way back in '86 (he was 59). Have lost my favourite Aunt and many others since, BUT I gave because I can't stand seeing a boy with his hair that long... lol"
457963,Jewelbee,2010-04-19 23:01:00,422,Thank you so much! I also lost my step mom to lung cancer 12 yrs ago. I'm so grateful that cancer research has given me Rick
