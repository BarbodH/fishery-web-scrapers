My ultimate goal for stealheading is trying to avoid using fish roe completely.  So I decided to tie some natural/realistic looking flies, I started with stone fly.   Speil inspired, but I think mine looks more like a crossbreed between a crayfish and a scorpion   And hopefully I can fool steelheads like this one with my new creations "
457017,alphaalpha,2010-04-17 09:23:00,475,nice work! good luck out there.
457019,Spiel,2010-04-17 10:31:00,9065,I'm both impressed and flattered.I think they look awesome and I've no doubt the trout will too.

457971,graham,2010-04-19 23:11:00,14,"Very impressive young_one. I'm guessing your legs are raffia or swiss straw tied and trimmed, thats a lot of work but they make an awesome realistic looking fly fly. I hope they work well for you."
457974,Leecher,2010-04-19 23:14:00,7832,Awesome work young_one Good luck on your trout hunt Leechman
