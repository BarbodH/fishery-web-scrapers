The game warden asked the man, 'Do you have a license to catch those fish?' 'Naw, sir', replied the Newfie. 'I ain't got none of dem dere Licenses. I don't need one. You must understand, by, dese here is My pet fish.' 'Pet fish?'  'Yeah. Dat's de trut' bye. Every night, I take dese fish down to de Cove and let 'em swim 'round for awhile. Den, when I whistles, dey jump right back into dese here ice chests and I takes 'em home.'  'That's a bunch of hooey! Fish can't do that.'  The Newfie looked at the warden for a moment and then said, 'It's de Trut Mr. Government Man. I'll show ya. It really works.'  'O.K.', said the warden. 'I've got to see this!'  The Newfie stood on a rock and poured the fish into the cove. Then he stood and looked out to sea.  After several minutes, the warden says, 'Well?' 'Well, what?', says the Newf. The warden says, 'When are you going to call them back?' 'Call who back?'  'The FISH', replied the warden!  'What fish?', replied the Newfie.  Moral of the story: Newfies may not be as smart as some city slickers on De mainland but by the lard tundering jaysus we ain't as dumb as some Government employees."
