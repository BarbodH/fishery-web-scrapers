457976,mattyk,2010-04-19 23:22:00,2110,Looks kind of small to me. Can't go wrong with a Shimano Calcutta 400TE.
457984,mbac31,2010-04-19 23:37:00,904,I have a few of them. What do you want to know about it. I'm using these for my bigger Swimbaits and Saltwater applications. I'm about to order 2 more.  I also have the Daiwa Ryoga from Japan. The JDM version of the Pluton comes in a Bay Jigging model. I love them and they will be a reel that will outlast alot of others. These are a different reel than the Calcutta.

457995,DANIMAL,2010-04-20 00:19:00,215,  I'm just looking for general reviews on them. How are they different from the Calcutta? Are they a lot smaller than the 400 model?
