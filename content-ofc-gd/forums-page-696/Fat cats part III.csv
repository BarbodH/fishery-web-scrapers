457196,Fisherpete,2010-04-17 21:34:00,1814,"Solo mission this time... 11 cats for the day. The last 40 minutes before dark was incredible... might even be the best 40 minutes of fishing I have ever experienced for any species. It took less than a minute to have a cat on each time I cast out during the hot spell... wicked fun. Biggest cat was 32"" and 15lbs, and of course, that is the one pic that turned out blurry lol... I love the bright yellow cats... check out the contrast between the yellow cat in the second last pic and the grey cat in the last pic... just too cool.  Learnings for the day:  1) Ten foot downrigger rods + netting big cats alone = challenge! 2) My cooler makes a great camera stand - now I know how to do my muskie shots in the summer 3) When the cats turn on, THEY TURN ON!  Enjoy the pics... I enjoyed making them                "
