457903,Afraz,2010-04-19 20:02:00,250,"Hey Guys,  I was wondering if presquile provincial park had any fishing opportunities for the shore bound angler, or perhaps someone with an inflatable who really can't go too far from shore. If there are opportunities to fish this location, then what kind of species can one get into ? what kind of techniques work best for this place.  Thanks  "

458119,ricoboxing,2010-04-20 14:05:00,398,I was at the park last week and didn't see very much shore fishing spots that looked good. Better off going a little east to Belleville or up the river (Moira I think).
