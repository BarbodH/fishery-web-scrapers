456842,Drock6687,2010-04-16 21:07:00,90,"So I have always loved fishing but untill last fall I had only caught bass and pike.  My uncle, a life long steelhead and brown trout fisherman took me out and I caught my first steelhead and ever since then I have been addicted....  My uncle told me that I need to get a longer rod (i was using a cheap 5 ft rod) so today I bought a 10 ft shimanco convergence salmon/steelhead rod... I paid $79.99 for it... does anyone have any expeirence with this rod?  Was that a OK price for it?  Thanks everyone~"
456854,JPD,2010-04-16 21:23:00,296,"Considering it comes with a limited lifetime warranty I would say you did great! Awesome starter rod. As you get more and more into it you may want top go longer and lighter but that rod will do a lot of great things for you, especially compared to a 5 footer!  Enjoy  JP"
456858,ecmilley,2010-04-16 21:28:00,2163,"you did great the convergance is a decent rod and 10 ft is the perfect starter length, just remember steelhead rods are like bass boats, always want another foot. goodluck and good fishin"
456923,MJL,2010-04-17 00:25:00,2427,"There are 2 rods in the 10ft range…1 that’s 10ft rated 8-17 and the other is 10’6” rated 4-6lb  I’ve owned the 10ft (8-17lb) since 2004 or 2005.  I bought it from Hooked and Tackled for around $85 when Jacky closed shop.  It’s a beefy rod with a slower, parabolic action (as far as heavier salmon/steelhead rods go).  Under extreme pressure, it will bend down to the handle with 12lb line.  I use mine for stalking carp in the shallows as well as pier chucking lures for salmon and steelhead.  It's a good rod IMO for those purposes.  It may be a little too heavy of a rod for clear water, small creek steelheading where you might have to drop down to 4-5lb leaders."
456938,Drock6687,2010-04-17 01:08:00,90, The one that I got is the10ft 8-17 now I just need to find a half decent spinning reel for it...
456948,Bondar,2010-04-17 01:42:00,817,   isnt there a rebate on right now for that rod ? 15 bucks off?   if your model number ends with an A like so CVCL106M2A you should have gotten a rebate card with it rebate goes till the 30th of this month just a heads up worth a try
456963,graham,2010-04-17 02:04:00,14,"Sounds like a good price for that rod but like MJL stated that rod might be a bit to heavy if you're planning on doing mostly float fishing or bottom bouncing in smaller clearer rivers which require lighter leaders of 3 to 6lb test. A lighter and longer rod will be more flexible and forgiving while using those lighter leaders and a longer rods gives you better line control. \  Remember that the lightest part of your set-up is not the main line but the leader and the heavier your leader is the less hook ups especially under clear conditions.  Sorry to be negative, but if I was you I would try to return it for a 4 to 8lb rod instead and go up another foot or 2 if you plan on float fishing in clear smaller rivers.  Get a reel with a super smooth drag and minimum line capacity of 8lbs /150yds  - check out the Okuma Inspira and US reels. I have 2 and really like them."
456969,vinnimon,2010-04-17 02:14:00,2593,"I used to have a canadian northern series for starters,and I broke it.I then picked up a convergence 12 1/2 ft im6.I use it for back up now, and still like it.I paid about the same for it.A good rod for the price,but not comparable with my raven rod.The conv I use with a spinning reel."
457014,Jackie,2010-04-17 07:50:00,124,"I agree with most people here that the rod would feel too heavy after several hours of use.  Check out some of the lighter models, especially if you plan to do a lot of drift/float fishing.  Or go with even shorter rod (like 8'6"") if you're only fishing small tributaries.  I once had a 12'6"" L action Convergence, and honestly I would quit fishing after a couple of hours on the river simply because it's too heavy to hold all day.  Or maybe I was just impatient..."
457015,jon0gaona,2010-04-17 09:05:00,3,"Regarding a spinning reel, go for the daiwa SS Whisker. Durable reel you won't regret."
457088,OhioFisherman,2010-04-17 15:03:00,6623,"No experience with the Convergence fly rods, but the spinning and bait casting models do the job, I have a few and like them. Ran into a close out sale here stateside and they had them marked down to 20 bucks so I bought6.  ""I once had a 12'6"" L action Convergence, and honestly I would quit fishing after a couple of hours on the river simply because it's too heavy to hold all day. Or maybe I was just impatient... ""  Heavier than a penn 209 loaded with a couple hundred yards of 20-30 pound test on a 6 foot solid fiberglass rod? Casting tackle up north back in the mid 60`s, 14-15-16 and I fished all day, dawn to dark."
457118,rapala14,2010-04-17 17:22:00,44,"My brother and buddy both have the 10'6 model and both really like it.  Mind you they are using it to cast hardware.  dunno what its like for drifting.  I havent handled the 10' that you have but i'd agree with the previous posters and say it might be a little heavy, unless your casting spoons off the pier.  But hey man, its your world, if it feels right to you and you like it... power to ya.  As for a reel, Shimano seharra is a clutch one to go with.  incredibly smooth drag, well built and just an all round great reel."
457665,chefboi17,2010-04-19 01:24:00,128,"i'm using a 12.6 right now with my drift setup, it is a bit on the heavy side, but it get's the job done at a great price"
457773,Jackie,2010-04-19 13:31:00,124,"Actually I just bought a 13' Shimano Clarus (CSS-130ML2A) rated for 4-8lb, Tennessee handle.  Will use it for shore fishing on Niagara.  Probably not as ""noodle"" as the 10'6"" or 12'6"" Convergence.  But I got it for only $59.99 at the Gagnon Sports yard sale."
