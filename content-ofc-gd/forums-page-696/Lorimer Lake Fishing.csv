Only got a chance to fish from the docks and caught one of everything probly. Pretty little though.  Went for a tour on the house boat and there was a lot of nice structured bay's.. Looked great for large mouth and pike fishing.  Pretty dissapointed i didnt get a chance to fish it like i planned, so make sure you let me know how you make out.  Good Luck."
386704,Guest Johnny Bass,2009-09-25 00:08:00,0,There is this bay and then there is a road and there is a river that goes across the road and to another lake. Anyways in that bay by the shore? Either early morning or late evening(In the summer is when I went) Is loaded with big pike. Every rock bass I caught was hammered by a big pike. I also had a rainbow follow a husky jerk but dont know how common they are in the lake. Hope this helps.
386987,capt bruce,2009-09-25 17:34:00,820,"I dont know about rainbows but theres lake trout ,Never fished there in the summer ,  A friend of a friend has a place there and we ice fished there for lakers a few years back we made out ok if I remember nothing huge but great red fleshed eaters in the 2-3 pound range , nice spot but probably busy in the summer as I remember the whole shore line was cottages no crown land ."

I believe that the Tim Horton's kids camp is still located on Lorimer Lake but didn't notice them doing a lot of fishin' when I was there. Lots of smallmouth and rockies around the islands and some big panfish in the back bays.
