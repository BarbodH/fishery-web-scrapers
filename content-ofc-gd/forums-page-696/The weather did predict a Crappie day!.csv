457678,TC1OZ,2010-04-19 02:11:00,987,Went out with Carpman3000 and Ed for some crappie.  The weather was predicted to be horrible for today! Thankfully that wasn't the case. Showed up around 11:45 AM and the fish were just biting. We were using 1/8 OZ jigs with micro tubes.  Here's my first crappie / first time using a tube jig successfully :   And another:   Here's one of Carpman3000's:   And my favorite type of bait the old worm got the biggest fish of the day. Ed reeled in a real slab at 12.5 Inches and 1Lbs :   We caught a total of 7 crappie and 3 blue gill in a matter of 1 1/2 hours. All and all I would say it was a successful outing!
