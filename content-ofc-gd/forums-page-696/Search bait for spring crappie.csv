458248,Musky or Specks,2010-04-20 21:19:00,2710,Headed out to fish a lake for crappie that Ive only iced fished before. Big lake and want a few choices in baits for covering water. Will have slip floats and tubes and jigs and live minnows. But was wondering if there were any faves out there for covering water.

458295,Slop,2010-04-20 23:49:00,151,"Unless the situation absolutely requires a float, then I will never use them.  Depending on conditions, eighth ounce jigs and 3 inch twister tails or minnow imitations are about as an effective search tool as you can get....besides, they are cheap. Small crankbaits and stickbaits are very effective as well providing Pike are not going to be a problem where you are fishing. Suspending models seem to work better than sinking or floating types. For both jigs and cranks, a slow, steady retreive with the odd pause will trigger strikes.  Where and when to search? That's a topic in itself."
