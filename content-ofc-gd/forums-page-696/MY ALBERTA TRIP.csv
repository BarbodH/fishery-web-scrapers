458005,DMASSE,2010-04-20 00:52:00,420,"Hello  Thought that I would share my trip to Alberta,  I have to go for some family matters but managed to find tons of free time to fish THE BOW, THE OLDMAN, 2 National Parks and tons of mountain lakes and streams.   Tons of fish caught ranging from CUTTHROATS, BULL TROUT, RAINBOWS,MOUNTAIN WHITEFISH and some others I didnt know what they were.  All were caught and released,  My guide didnt like taking pics of fish or even handling them so we used a release tool,  so that they can fight another day..  The pics are mostly scenery shots of the areas I fishined  BANIFF NATIONAL PARKS HERE I WAS USING A 10ft 7wt rod and swinging and stripping large flies like BOW RIVER BUGGERS     WATERTON NATIONAL PARK GREAT mountain view,  this area has about 100 stream that flow into this lake...  Hiking to a little gem spot    Tons of wildlife,  I saw Mule Deer, Mountains sheep (long horn) moose, coyotes, bears, elk, white tale deer. tons of hawks, eagles, first time ever a MAG-PIE  also I thought I was going crazy when I saw this Bird  a PELICAN  I talked to a warden and he said they fly here and usually dont make it back...      This is one of my fav shot,  its me fishing a stream 2 hours in the interior of CANMORE (atv's).  It was just amazing,  the fish were stacked up like cord wood, it was almost to easy...    More to come when I get my other camera out of luggage  Hope you enjoyed It  Dave"
