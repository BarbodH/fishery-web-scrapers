457914,Afraz,2010-04-19 20:46:00,250,"Hey Guys,  I was wondering if darlingtom provincial park had any fishing opportunities for the shore bound angler (McLaughlin Bay), or perhaps someone with an inflatable who really can't go too far from shore. If there are opportunities to fish this location, then what kind of species can one get into ? what kind of techniques work best for this place.  Thanks"
