457498,Afraz,2010-04-18 17:59:00,250,"I have a bunch on uncured fish roe, Chinook roe to be precise. I was going to make bait for trout opener but this year has been so retarded i dunno if its even worth making roe sacs anymore."
457545,Twocoda,2010-04-18 20:28:00,4130,"  what you proposed is an illegal action ...""if"" you want to ""give"" him some you can   ""Fish roe may be legally stripped (taken) from fish that are legally caught provided that the fish itself is not discarded and wasted. You may also give fish roe to other anglers for their use but an angler may not sell, trade or barter fish or fish parts including the eggs. Only the holder of a commercial fish licence or an aquaculture licence may sell fish roe."""

457965,graham,2010-04-19 23:03:00,14,Anglers Pro Shop in Orangeville sells really good rainbow roe by the half pound and pound. It is fish farm roe and it is lightly salt cured but works very good. http:/www.anglerspro.ca
