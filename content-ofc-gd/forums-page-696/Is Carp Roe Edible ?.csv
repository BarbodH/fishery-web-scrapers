457793,Toronto_Angler,2010-04-19 14:49:00,698,"Hey Afraz, I'm greek and in my family and every taramasolata we have used Cod Roe. I know on the internet it says that carp roe has been used but I've never heard of that...BTW if you've never had it you should try because it is delicious!"
457797,Harrison,2010-04-19 15:23:00,2202,"I was bet one year at trout opener that I wouldn't eat a handfull of Salmon singles.  I did, got a case a beer and a life time gag reflex everytime I get a good wiff of a popped single.  Awesome, since I am steelheader.  Carp scales are great guitar picks."
457901,Afraz,2010-04-19 19:56:00,250,"Lol i love Salmon Roe right out of the well you know, but its probably laden with way too much heavy metals, dioxins and what not. So thats why Salmon roe is strictly bait. I figured maybe carp would be alrite since its not a pelagic fish, sorta like a uglier nastier sturgeon ( i know beluga roe from Iran is a delicacy) Ihave no idea why i am comparing carp to beluga LMAO.  But anyway, my carp roe dreams have now been shattered i shall use the skein as water ballons XD"

457510,Afraz,2010-04-18 18:23:00,250,"Alrite before people freak out, and say its a trash fish why would you eat eggs of trash and what not. Bear with me, i googled Carp Roe Recipies and the results i got were for something called ""taramOsalata"" a Greek dish apparently which is simply fish roe usually Carp or Cod all mashed up mixed with herbs and spices. Now my problem is how do you remove the skein from the roe ? and for myself personally the black colored eggs really put me off unlike Salmon or trout Roe which at least look good to eat but is probably laden with DDTs and what not.  So yeah, is carp roe edible ? and if so what can you make with it, how do you prepare it ?  On another note what about panfish roe ? Say if you catch a mess of crappie/bluegill/perch and you find those yellow jewels inside could they be put to good use ? Bait or for table fare ?  Thanks"
457515,Roy,2010-04-18 18:34:00,13728,I make a point of never eating anything that comes out of a fish's anal vent. I don't care how exotic or exciting it might sound to you.
457519,skeeter,2010-04-18 18:45:00,1907,Then why do you eat what comes out of a chickens azz? ROY
457537,BillM,2010-04-18 20:01:00,17367," Dude, you must have failed biology class."
457540,skeeter,2010-04-18 20:14:00,1907,ok i give up ! where do you think a chickens egg comes from??
457541,TC1OZ,2010-04-18 20:14:00,987,lol @ this thread!  I wouldn't eat a carp
457543,Afraz,2010-04-18 20:21:00,250,"If you can't help, no point in mocking someone for trying not to waste fish Parts. I know what most of my buddies do with carp. Yep they make the grass greener. Or they trade carp for tackle with their asian buddies lmao. I have enuff tackle and no lawn. So that leaves me with either cook it or dump it back where it came from so it can continue destroying the habitat feeding of gamefish eggs and uprooting plants."
457544,TC1OZ,2010-04-18 20:27:00,987, I don't eat fish in general... I was laughing at the replies!
457548,bushart,2010-04-18 20:40:00,2628,C & R is the only thing to do with carp--then you don't have to worry about wasting flesh
457549,skeeter,2010-04-18 20:42:00,1907,"If you can't help, no point in mocking someone for trying not to waste fish flesh.  when did the fish flesh come into this topic????????????????? you asked about their eggs not the flesh........ "
457552,Twocoda,2010-04-18 20:54:00,4130," Fish roe may be legally stripped (taken) from fish that are legally caught provided that the fish itself is not discarded and wasted. You may also give fish roe to other anglers for their use but an angler may not sell, trade or barter fish or fish parts including the eggs. Only the holder of a commercial fish licence or an aquaculture licence may sell fish roe.   this is the second time i posted this information for you Afraz...hopefully youll get the hint that what you proposed in the other thread is illegal and the buddies you hang with are prctising illegal activities as well...."
457553,brifishrgy,2010-04-18 20:56:00,559,Yes .. eat em up
457559,Terry,2010-04-18 21:18:00,14456,I would not eat it  but yes ...eggs do come out the chickens butt
457561,bassman87,2010-04-18 21:25:00,586,tie giant carp roe bags and use them like waterballoons
457569,irishfield,2010-04-18 21:57:00,26272, You sayin Chickens don't have vaginas Terry...  
457572,Twocoda,2010-04-18 22:07:00,4130,hey ive been to Regina...oooops never mind
457605,Gman,2010-04-18 23:34:00,126,Carp can be smoked and it tastes great.  Haven't had any years.  I was first introduced to it back when we lived in Winnipeg.  Cheers G.
457609,Paully,2010-04-18 23:40:00,712, If you really think about it.. you're eating a chickens time of the month
457616,POLLIWOGG,2010-04-19 00:03:00,835,"My uncle used to sell them to the restaurants when he was a kid, the smaller ones made good halibut.  Fish house used to take them for the eggs."
457633,Afraz,2010-04-19 00:40:00,250,"  LMAO !!! ahahahhaha sounds like a great idea, heck the next time one of the fisheries officers pulls up i might just throw some his/her way, and den spend the next 20 years of my life in prison, for assualt with a biological weapon ahahahah.  Wow this thread just got out of hand, but seriously though. No one has secret carp roe recepies eh."
457644,Michael_Brown,2010-04-19 00:54:00,411,"Yes you can eat carp roe. Realize that carp are one of the most popular freshwater gamefish on the planet. Try search European and Asian recipes. Also panfish roe is excellent. I don't normally eat it, but I know a couple of people that would rather eat the roe skeins than the rest of the fish.  I have no problem with people trying non-game species for eating. Most are actually excellent table fare. Catfish and Ling would be two examples of fish that are not normally targeted in Ontario that are fanatstic table fare. In fact I have not harvested a walleye or trout in a few years, I have switched all of my fish harvest to panfish. Better eating, more numerous and the people I fish with are really good with bobbers.  If you harvest a fish, use as much of it as you can.  If your carp roe tastes like corn, your using too much chum."
457675,JPD,2010-04-19 02:05:00,296,I guess none of you have ever tried Taramosolata then? Great Greek traditional spread that involves Carp roe. I don't really eat fish but his stuff is amazing... Eddie's Steakhouse on Yonge just North of Steeles gives it to you as part of the pre meal snack with garlic bread to spread it on. Mmmmmmmmmmm  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taramosalata
457699,fishing,2010-04-19 02:39:00,167, I agree.  Many people might not feel like to try them though.
457726,Afraz,2010-04-19 04:31:00,250,"Apparently Taramosalata is a staple in greece, and you know the greeks are a smart bunch (well except when it comes to economics but thats a whole different ball game)"
457788,johnnyb,2010-04-19 14:38:00,3413,I remember trying Carp roe at a friend's house...he was Egyptian.  Had the stuff in a jar and liked to spread it on toast.  Wasn't horrible...
