457300,The JAY,2010-04-18 02:12:00,239,"I know I'm new here, and I'm not looking for anyone to give up a hot spot, but does anyone think/know if it's worthwhile trying to catch catfish off of shore in Dunnville? I haven't found a boat yet, and I would love to get in on the derby, but can you get them from shore? Thanks!"
457303,bucktail,2010-04-18 02:20:00,1857,"you can do allright from shore especially at sunset and night. You can fish right at Fishmasters orup near the dam.  Use some sucker meat and 3 oz siinkers and circle hooks,    Away you go!!!  "
457306,The JAY,2010-04-18 02:22:00,239,"Thank you sir, that's what I was looking for, and more!"
457311,uglyfish,2010-04-18 02:30:00,981,the past few years... several of the winning fish in the cat derby held by fishmaster have been caught from shore.
457321,HTHM,2010-04-18 02:49:00,4082,"Not only can you get them from shore, but Steve (Fishmaster) will give you good advice on how to fish for them as well. When y'all hook into a big kittie, it is a LOT of fun. Don't eat them over 7 pounds though...."
457327,The JAY,2010-04-18 02:54:00,239,"Okay, I'm sold. I'll have to take a drive out and introduce myself to Mr. Fishmaster... Thanks all!"
457425,Fisherpete,2010-04-18 13:59:00,1814,"Yup, just head to Fishmaster's place... I have seen some big cats caught from his shore this year."
457501,Afraz,2010-04-18 18:07:00,250,If not Steve's place there are other locations nearby. But Steve's place by far out performs all the others. Like BBQ island (water level way too low).
457615,vinnimon,2010-04-18 23:56:00,2593,"Dont forget to grab circle hooks and lead.I prefer the pencil weights myself.Esp if im up by the dam area.Have you figured the baitcastor out yet?.If you did, give that a go with the kitties.That would be fun!"
457691,The JAY,2010-04-19 02:25:00,239,"Yeah, a trip to the tackle shop is in my future. Never heard of circle hooks, and I don't have anything close to 3oz in a sinker, but that will soon be fixed. I'm also guessing my 10Lb Spiderwire mono won't cut it for these beasts... On the positive, I found a guy in Oakville that's giving away a 14' fibreglass, he's sending pics tomorrow, so I may soon be floating!"
457749,pikehunter,2010-04-19 11:13:00,1659,Also you can fish from the Grand Island BBQ and snuggle up close to the dam if you wish. Steve's is good too and you can also drive down to Port Maitland but mid-lower river up to the dam is better.
457790,The JAY,2010-04-19 14:44:00,239,What test line are folks using to catch these beasts anyway? 20Lb?
457822,Fisherpete,2010-04-19 16:28:00,1814,"I am using 50lb Powerpro on one reel, 17lb Trilene XT on the other. I like the Powerpro better as it casts a bit farther than the Trilene. So far, both lines have held up very well. You can get away with less than 3oz sinkers on the calm days, but if the wind is up or the current really flowing, the 3oz is good. If you are going to Steve's (Fishmaster's), he has all the hooks, beads, swivels and weights for sale at competetive prices, and even better, sells pre-made cat rigs. Just tie on and ready to go. Don't forget the cut bait!"
457866,The JAY,2010-04-19 18:09:00,239,"Thanks. From what I hear, the cut bait is THE key to it..."
457895,Afraz,2010-04-19 19:51:00,250,For some reason steve's cut bait always out performs our fresh cut sucker. As for port maitland i didn't think taht area wouldbe fishable for cats since most would have swam up stream.
458156,brifishrgy,2010-04-20 16:25:00,559," the distance from maitland to the dam isnt very far, they are spread threw out the river and dont stay in the same spots all the time, which is why moving frequently catches more fish."
