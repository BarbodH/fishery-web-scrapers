Seems Peter heard that myself and a few others were going to be there and he dropped everything and headed our way at the last minute. It was great to see them again and Charmine went one step further and made some of her homemade crab salad, a very delicious treat, very generous of her. Hopefully I can get up their way in the future.   THANK YOU!"
