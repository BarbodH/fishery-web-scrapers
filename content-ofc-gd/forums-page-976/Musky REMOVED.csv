241662,Headhunter,2008-08-20 18:37:00,5703,"Ok.... I guess I get it...no, on second thought I don't! What I mean is, I fully appreciate your decision to pull it, it is your right, but what I don' get is the attention issue and why catching a nice fish like that could possibly cause you grief. If that's what happened, I feel sorry for the Musky folks as isn't this what you are all striving for. Man, it's not like it was a steelie or something! HH"
