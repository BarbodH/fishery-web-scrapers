241772,solopaddler,2008-08-20 23:49:00,8605," John, based on your avatar pic you might be a bit older than me but I'll bet not by much. Unless you're employer hired toddlers to do claims work.."
241773,JohnF,2008-08-20 23:50:00,3494," 62 - Beat that, kid.  JF"
241779,solopaddler,2008-08-21 00:05:00,8605," Bingo, I'm 57!  Just kidding, you were right about the diaper thing    (but you look younger)  I was born under the sign of the fish on the ides of March in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty five."
241790,JohnF,2008-08-21 00:40:00,3494," I act a lot younger, to my wife's constant chagrin.  So I wuz on the money with the diaper guess. I was about 19 when I started with the claims adjuster.  JF"
241904,aplumma,2008-08-21 11:48:00,6896,Usually the insurance companies will cover the damage that is caused by the act or the damage to repair the issue but the actual incident is not covered. The damage to a fence or lawn is covered and the rental of the equiptment is too but the actual removal or repair is not. I have done water line repairs were the insurance company will pay for everything except the part and the time of the actual repair to a water line. So the owner was out 15 min and 5.00 worth of parts. go figure..... of course this is the rulling here in the USA and may have no relevents in Canada.  Art
241667,Joey,2008-08-20 18:53:00,9122,"Sometimes I believe in it, sometimes not.  I know a few people who I say Karma will always get them and it never does, they just go on be jackarses!!  As for the insurance company, what kind of malarky is that??  An act of God!!  I think they tried to fluff you off and unfortunately it worked Mike.  It's too late now, but I would have demanded action by them.  If it fell on your car you can darn well be sure they'd pay for that, how is this any different?  It was still the same act of God! What if you don't believe in God  I'm in the industry and between Paul and myself, we have had insurance companies try that line on more than a few sitations where it was not true and would be covered if pursued.  Joey"
241675,solopaddler,2008-08-20 19:02:00,8605,"  I don't know Joey you may be right, but my first call was to my broker, my 2nd was to my insurance company. Both told me the same thing.  Damage to my property would have been covered for sure, but the damage was minimal and my deductable is $500, so it wasn't worth it to put the claim in.  Cleanup of the mess wasn't covered at all...at least that's what I was told  ."
241686,douG,2008-08-20 19:37:00,2693,"I had a plumbing issue once with water damage to the living room.  New flooring and paint were covered, but not the plumber.  I think that this is the same idear."
241701,Roy,2008-08-20 20:35:00,13728,"When their's damage caused by plumbing, the plumber usually gets covered in it too."
241765,JohnF,2008-08-20 23:40:00,3494," I don't think you were conned. As frustrating as it seems, it's the way it is. If the tree had damaged your house it would have been different, but the tree cleanup would have still been your problem. It's years since I worked in Insurance claims but that's how it used to be when you were in diapers.  JF"
