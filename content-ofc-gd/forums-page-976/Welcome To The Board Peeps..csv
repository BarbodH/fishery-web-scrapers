98,Joey,2006-11-15 21:18:00,9122,Will I need a certain download to use the chat.  I could never get to work on the old board.  Thanks  Joey
101,bigfish1965,2006-11-15 21:26:00,3382,Yes Joey..you will need Java. I'll even find you a link for it.  http://www.java.com/en/download/index.jsp
241782,HTHM,2008-08-21 00:15:00,4082,"Even at the beginning Rick is helpful. Eight years ago. Maybe I have no right to do this, but I thought it may be interesting to go to the ""last page"" and bump one of the posts. No offence intended"
241783,Greencoachdog,2008-08-21 00:22:00,8163,"No more ""incognito"" chats???... what a bummer!!!  You'll actually know who you're chatting with... how boring is that???   ... so when Frank Sinatra signs in... it'll really be him???"
241784,tjsa,2008-08-21 00:25:00,1578,"Just tried it Glen, still the same as before."
241785,Greencoachdog,2008-08-21 00:30:00,8163,"yeah, i don't see the who's chatting thingy at the bottom of the board yet though....   ... all good things got to come to an end... and it's the same with the Wildwood Weed..."
241786,tjsa,2008-08-21 00:32:00,1578, I cannot find it either.

241843,Daplumma,2008-08-21 02:09:00,1961,"Some said it was a flower,others a weed,we never give it no thought.Then one day i was talkin to my brother and I bent down to get a weed to chew on.things got fuzzy and then got blurry and then everything was gone.... Joe"
241851,Greencoachdog,2008-08-21 02:48:00,8163,"I think the ""who's"" in chat is a good thing!  Y'all would not believe some of the characters I've met in there... I think Freakshow and the Alabama deer hunter even showed up one night with Harold and Kumar!   ... and I'm absolutely positive someone else has been signing in under my name, causing a bunch of trouble and then leaving!!!"
241883,snag,2008-08-21 05:20:00,1932,"    YOU SIR,  ARE A GENTLEMAN!     LET'S DANCE,     TICKLE ME WITH YOUR FINGER MUSCLES MAESTRO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  YOU HAVE NO MASTER    "
241962,douG,2008-08-21 15:36:00,2693,"Your strangest post yet, Snag, and that's saying something."
241971,HTHM,2008-08-21 16:16:00,4082,"Look at the time stamp, that may explain it..."
