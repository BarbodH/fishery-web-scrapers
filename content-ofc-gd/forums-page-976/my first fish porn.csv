241886,jace,2008-08-21 05:45:00,472,"I haven't posted any of my catches so i figured I should start.   The run is not too bad this year for me and I've been getting into these fish past few weeks.  They started out a little smaller but now they're getting nice and fat.  fresh sea run fish with a really wild fight.  for scale, the rapala knife has 9"" blade so it's about 14"" overall.  it's a coho..   "
241887,Ben_Daniels,2008-08-21 05:55:00,435,mmmm....salmon and ketchup  . Nice catch!  -Ben

241899,Greencoachdog,2008-08-21 11:28:00,8163,Looks like you shot it instead of caught it!
241909,silveradosheriff,2008-08-21 12:21:00,1025,Looks tasty to me....  :-)
241975,Leecher,2008-08-21 16:23:00,7832,Great report and pic j ace  Thanks for sharing Leechman
242026,limeyangler,2008-08-21 18:32:00,5204,that salmon is definitely calorifically challenged(fat)!
242027,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-08-21 18:32:00,0,Don't you know that fishing with dynamite is illegal in Ontario??Just joking.  Nice catch and thanks for sharing!
242033,jace,2008-08-21 18:40:00,472,"What makes fishermen happier than bloody decks, eh?   I've eaten fish every day for a while, i'm coming in with a few fish everyday, giving away a lot of it to friends who are trying to fill their freezers for the winter.   I think i'm just about done with my own keep of this fish, on average they clean out to 6-8# each and i need to save room for other species.    I believe the local coho derby leader is over 19#, it's too bad more people don't buy derby tickets.  If i'm lucky, i'll be able to get photo of a shot fish for you GCD.    I think all the hunting people would like it, just seeing it the first time was hilarious to me.  ..not to glorify the actual fish shooting part but the whole scenario of seeing a person pull out a handgun to land a fish."
242036,highdrifter,2008-08-21 18:41:00,2534,Nice!  Bloodiest fish porn ever though..  Looks like Freddy Crueger had a go at her before you did!!  LOL HD
242069,PatrickGG,2008-08-21 20:13:00,562,The pic would be a finish with a pair of Isotoners?
242073,blaque,2008-08-21 20:32:00,2419," sorry but did ya ever get one of those subtly funny things that has you laugh out of nowhere when ya think of it even hours later lol, it just popped into my head again after reading it earlier and im still laughing.......guy next to me at work thinks im a little loopy"
242074,StrealHeader,2008-08-21 20:41:00,56,Is it just me or did you slaughter a Chinook?
242104,Radnine,2008-08-21 23:00:00,1538,"So, if the blade of the knife is nine inches long, I am guessing that there was about three inches sticking out of the other side of the fish each time you stabbed it. How's my math?"
242111,jace,2008-08-21 23:19:00,472,"  it's a coho. Kings aren't running where I caught it.  It's a pretty big coho, is that why you think it's a king?   Check the length of the 1st ray on the anal fin and you can see the white gumline."
242119,jace,2008-08-21 23:26:00,472,"  way off.  The girth on this fish is probably 20"" and it's around 30"" in length.   I duplicated the image of knife, copy/paste/rotated it to match the position of the fish.  It looks like about 1"" coming out the other side.   It's big and fat for a coho, but not big compared to others i'm getting.  I should take more pictures but i don't really think of it..too busy fishing and getting the lines back in.    thanks for the funny comments from all the gore lovers out there.      blood soaked gloves and a pair of Bruno Magli shoes coming up."
242139,PatrickGG,2008-08-22 00:53:00,562, LOL! I never even Noticed it was a Coho if thats the case thats on bigun.
