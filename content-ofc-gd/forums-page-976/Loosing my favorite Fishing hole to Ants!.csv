225455,Anton Kanagasuntheri,2008-07-09 17:08:00,160,"Hi Guys,  I’ve been fishing in this particular spot (east end) for the past 10 years, great fishing. By this year Ants â€œredâ€ moved in and making my day a living hell   . At first I didn’t mind them, but now they are getting pretty vicious.  Last time I was there, I had a nice bit, I set the hook and fighting the fish, suddenly I get a huge bite on my neck, flick that Ant off, then I get a bite on my crotch, I basically threw my rod down along with the fighting bass on the end, ran around trying to remove my waders and pants to get that ant out!!!  Is there anything I could do to persuade them to move? Any local remedies or methods? I thought of buying a case of Raid and spraying the entire case on the area, BUT, I don’t think that’s safe for the environment and for the fish lives in the water… Please need help!   Thanks in Advance,  Anton"
225459,ccmtcanada,2008-07-09 17:14:00,7971,"Hmmm....raid wouldn't work for long anyways.  You need an insecticide that doesn't kill them right away....the workers take the poison back to the queen, where it will eventually die.  Go to CTC or Home Depot...check out their insecticide sections...most ones specifically for ants will have this slow acting insecticide.  Good luck!"
225462,ccmtcanada,2008-07-09 17:17:00,7971,"Oh yeah...forgot to add, that this is typically something you have to do repeatedly...one or two applications is rarely enough, since there could be multiple colonies in the area."
225467,MuddyWater,2008-07-09 17:22:00,218,those dam red ants have been destroying my fishing for many years every year i see them getting farther north on the east tribs. as for getting away from them i would stand in the water. ALTHOUGH i have seen them floating down the water and clinging to my legs ive been bit so many times i freakin hate them. the worst is stinging nettle with red ants on it jesus thats a painfull collision. i was pondering the thought of spraying raid onto my shoes or boots so they wouldnt climb on. those ants are some kind of invading species. im always looking at the ground one thing i have found if you look down and see black ants your safe. some areas have millions of red ants they eat eachother. here is some info on your enemy i hate them so much. http://creatures.ifas.ufl.edu/urban/ants/Myrmica_ruba.htm good luck!!! youll need it!!
225468,Nemo,2008-07-09 17:23:00,727,With all due respect I would try to find another spot. Let nature take it's course and respect their space.  IMHO spreading/spraying a bunch of insecticide in your favourite fishing hole doesn't seem like a good idea. Ministry may not appreciate it either... but hey what do I know..  my 2cents
225488,Headhunter,2008-07-09 17:58:00,5703,"Ant Be Gone comes in a tube that looks like Dristan Mist... just squeeze some in the area they are thick, they will lick the stuff up and take it back to the nest... has not failed me yet! Available at yer finer CTC stores. HH"
225491,Pachone,2008-07-09 18:08:00,276,"I've noticed this too, AS well as being a bite victim. DAmn"
225495,danbo,2008-07-09 18:11:00,2646,"Yep..need a new spot..they got you surrounded, out-numbered & mortally wounded already!  http://www.madcowprod.com/exterminators.gif"
225580,holdfast,2008-07-09 23:25:00,1813,Ah Keep fishing and take the pain.

225582,Greencoachdog,2008-07-10 00:05:00,8163,"Insecticides are very bad for aquatic life!!!  Get yourself a can of gasoline and pour a small amount on each mound, no worse than running a 2 stroke motor.  Don't light the gas on fire! It will soak in a little and evaporate, it will kill some of the ants and the ones that don't die will go deep into the ground.  I've been fighting Fire Ants for over 30 yrs.!"
225626,MoriaRiverMan,2008-07-10 01:26:00,314,windex glass cleaner.  Works like a champ
225665,Zib,2008-07-10 02:49:00,369,"Instead of spraying the area make up some ""sweet baits"" for them to enjoy while you are fishing then remove them when you leave. Mix 3 tablespoons of boric acid with 1 cup of warm water, and ½ a cup of sugar should make an appropriate solution that can either be put in a shallow dish for ants to get to or soaked up in cotton balls and set plastic around the nest. They will go back to the nest with the bait on them & kill there buddies in the colony."
225672,BabyHerc,2008-07-10 03:29:00,285, I'll agree with Nemo.  I have some spots that I love to fish but are chalk full of fire ants.  Tough it out like a man or go fishing at Glen Haffy for some stocked trout.  Wussies.
225674,Sinker,2008-07-10 03:31:00,8692,Oh man.....sceeered of a few little bitty ants? Come on.......man up dude!!! It'll heal!!  Sinker
225749,Billy Bob,2008-07-10 13:08:00,5865,What you need is a ant eater. Do you want me to send you my sister in-law. She will eat ANYTHING and has the girth to prove it
225750,Anton Kanagasuntheri,2008-07-10 13:10:00,160,"  I am an being a wuss, I've been toughing it out since May, but i am not a P.O.V from Vietnam to tough out bites on my nuts!  I am going to try all your methods, well most of it... its just too good of a spot for me to let it go.. I catch everything from Salmon, trout, bass, pike, sheepshead, perch, channal cats including carp at nights, this is like the one spot for all different seasons!"
225753,Uncle Buck,2008-07-10 13:16:00,1000,try regular salt... or Chalk powder
225767,tonyb,2008-07-10 13:56:00,1637,"Can't be much help, but I thought your handle and the title of the thread were kind of funny.  Instead of Fish on!.....in your case it is Ant on! haha"
225768,Anton Kanagasuntheri,2008-07-10 14:01:00,160,"  Hey Tony B, yes it is funny, I never thought of this lol this could be my new handle from now onn.. ""Ant On"""
225816,blaque,2008-07-10 16:26:00,2419,"THats hilarious you said that tony, i was about to post the exact same thing!!!!! Until i scrolled down to see  your post"
241699,canadianboy,2008-08-20 20:30:00,83,hey i know a solution baking soda and icing sugar half and half on a becel lid i put it at the cottage in the gardens it kills some instantl and some take it back to the ant hills
241708,Wild,2008-08-20 20:52:00,704,"Being a pro on the subject I can confirm that post #13 is the correct method, workers will bring the bait back to the nest to feed the colony and kill the queen. Borax can be purchased as '20 mule team brand' for laundry.  Greencoachdog if you want the best cure for fire ants  ever use pine oil?"
241714,BeRad3000,2008-08-20 21:23:00,65,Ya i know all about the red ants in the east end.
241811,highdrifter,2008-08-21 01:08:00,2534,"Ah yes.. sounds like you've met the shore fisherman's nemesis, the dreaded Fire ant!  We wade to keep away from those little beasties and they still manage to find us...  and they'll even hitch a ride for a while and sting hours afterwards!!  I feel your anguish.  Try mustard powder mixed with water.. It's an irritant more than anything, we use it to get worms before we'd out if we hadn't gone out worming the night before..  They squirm right outta their holes full speed..  It's pretty wild!  I'd like to see them suckers squirm for once.  cheers HD"
