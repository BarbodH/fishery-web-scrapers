Found out this week that my 19-year old ""Springbok"" was selected as the August winner in the 'Reader's Rides' section of the website.    After a quick email with Karl today, I headed on a short five minute drive to the Interstate dealer here in Ottawa, and picked up my prize - a pair of Deep Cycle marine batteries.  The owner, James Locke, was extremely kind and helpful, and had me loaded up with my free gear in no time at all.  (171 MacFarlane Rd., Unit C, 613-798-9700)    This is the second time I've won with Extreme Angler - picked up a trolling motor less than two years ago!  Give these contests a go - you never know when your name will be picked...  Thanks again, Karl - keep up the great work on the show - it is one of the better ones out there!  Good Fishing,  Justin"
