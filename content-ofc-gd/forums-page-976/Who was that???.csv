242175,HTHM,2008-08-22 02:30:00,4082,"I was puttin Lure Laundry back on the trailer when I hear, ""Hometown 50 cents a kilometer"" from a train. Had you jumped off the train I had a spare rod and seat along with the fact that I was marking a lot of salmon in the bay. A re-launch is as good as a launch in my opinion. Next time perhaps"
242212,ccmtcanada,2008-08-22 03:24:00,7971,"That's hilarious!!!  Hope you find out who it was...LOL.  Going back to your thread, JohnF, Tonyb, Lexxington, Fishindevil,  mentioned 50 cents....hmmmm.....could it be one of them?"
242214,HTHM,2008-08-22 03:26:00,4082,"I know it was not JohnF as we have met... you and I on the other hand have not, want to change that?"
242215,ccmtcanada,2008-08-22 03:27:00,7971, Always up for meeting new people!  You ever get east of Toronto?
242218,HTHM,2008-08-22 03:34:00,4082,It has happened....however the lovely and talented Bly is part of the equaison. Your boat or mine?
242220,Radnine,2008-08-22 03:36:00,1538,It was I Hometown. I was doing the Bayfront thing with the family (Will loves the Haida). It was our first trip on the trolley and it was thoroughly enjoyable. The only thing that stopped me from engaging in more OFC chat was the fact that my wife was giving me the “quit yelling at strangers from a moving trolley” look (you know the one). I am glad that you caught the reference. Did I hear you mention something about Saturday? Jim
242224,HTHM,2008-08-22 03:39:00,4082,I am flying out Sat to the rectangle province. Thanks for clearing it up!
242266,Radnine,2008-08-22 12:21:00,1538,"I love meeting OFC'rs. The last one was in the emergency ward at Henderson Hospital in the Hammer. One thing about working out of town, remember that everything that you do costs money. If you were at home you would reach for a newspaper or snacks out of the cupboard and it would be factored into daily life. When you are on the road you have to buy all of those things (while they are sitting at home), including things like entertainment etc. I imagine that you will be staying with your BIL, so the nickel and diming won't be too bad, but just remember to pay yourself and those at home who would normally count on you. How long are you gone for?"
242270,modny,2008-08-22 12:40:00,502,did u manage to land anything in the bay??
242275,HTHM,2008-08-22 12:52:00,4082,"Two weeks and no I did not land anything, saw a lot of big un's moving up , but when I reeled in there was a big ball of weed at the back of my cleo."
