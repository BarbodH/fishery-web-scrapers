The place I worked before where I am now was 880 _____rd the place I am at now 2580 and the place I was at when I got out of the forces was 1680. Well it just so happens that the place I was on my way to was also 880. So now things get really weird inside the bucket I was born on the 28th my 10 anniversary was 08/08/08 I’m 44 this year 4+4 is 8 and the year is 2008 in the 8th month and I’m driving a 98 vehicle.  My black and white bucket says no to hocus pocus mumbo jumbo but tucked away deep inside there somewhere in the depths something is telling me this is as it should be and I should really be looking at this.  So there you go how would you intemperate this phenomenon????????  Peter"
