Just finished the shingles. WHEW! Heck of a job to do by yourself. First time shingle job for me. Ya I have pounded down a few shingles before but I was the guy that the lead hand always yelled at ""GET ME MORE SHINGLES""  A bit more trim and another coat of paint the outside is complete. May work on the inside a bit this winter.   The next project is an old icehouse. The walls are a little tilted but ok. The roof is shot. But not this year, enough work this summer already. "

241832,Greencoachdog,2008-08-21 01:50:00,8163,Lookin' good Bernie!!!  Do I need to send you my carpentry and roofing resume?
241834,Mattones,2008-08-21 01:53:00,587,Great job man! I want to build my own little cabin one day.
241836,Daplumma,2008-08-21 01:56:00,1961,Good stuff bud.Been wonderin what you been up to. Joe
241837,Bernie,2008-08-21 01:58:00,3190, Now what would a southern guy like you know about an icehouse?  No resume required from you Glen. Anytime you want to come up and pound a few nails and do a little fishing you would be welcome.  Thanks  for the kind replies Mattones and Daplumma.
241901,aplumma,2008-08-21 11:33:00,6896, You all taught Glen what an icehole was so why not an icehouse.....   Great work Bernie glad to see you are not roaming the streets getting in trouble. The roof looks great and now that it is weather proof again you can take your time finishing up the interior.   Art
241928,Reef Runner,2008-08-21 13:37:00,980,Some real good handywork there Bernie.  Lookin' great!
241967,Headhunter,2008-08-21 16:02:00,5703,"Lookin great Bernie! I recall a smaller building, just ouside your cottage that sure did feel like an ice house the Saturday morning in February this year! I hope this means you get to do some more fishin now! Also, I tied up a few trailer hooks on some jigs last week up at Elk Lake... old school rocked! (But you already knew that!) HH"
241980,Bernie,2008-08-21 16:27:00,3190," Icehouses were even before my time. Maybe Glen could enlighten me on them. There is still some sawdust on the floor, but no ice.    Guess a heater in the backhouse will be required for some southern softies. Ya...more fishing coming up. Been doing OK though, been out a few times."
241994,ccmtcanada,2008-08-21 17:02:00,7971,Looking great Bernie!  You sure have been busy this summer....glad to hear you've been out fishing a few times this year.  Hope the summer has been a great one for you....hard to believe it's almost over already!!!
