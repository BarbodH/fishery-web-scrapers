I'll have access to a boat and fishing between 9am - 8pm. I already have some crappie spins, wobble glo lil corky, rooster tail, pickerel rig and squirmin squirt bait.  Thanks for any help"
241475,gone_fishin,2008-08-20 03:06:00,481,"are you fishing the big lake, or one of the inland lakes in the area?"
241674,bajangal,2008-08-20 19:01:00,7,Will be fishing both
241680,bajangal,2008-08-20 19:19:00,7,Where could I find fishing maps for Tobermory? I did some digging online but didnt find anything of use
241685,Paully,2008-08-20 19:32:00,712,"You should try the Sauble river, its not too far from where you are... Im going there in a month for salmon. Perhaps you may see some early runners! Good luck."
241767,JohnF,2008-08-20 23:44:00,3494," I was on the early ferry one morning recently and some guy trolled by in a tinny with what looked like a flasher running very shallow right tight alongside the ferry tied at the dock. I've dived at the Tub in a couple of spots in years gone by and frankly, I didn't see much worth catching close to Tobie.  JF"

241859,sconceptor,2008-08-21 03:09:00,146,"greybruceoutdoors.com has more info on the area.......... some teenager did well on Cyprus Lake right in the National Park last week.....he caught a good number (suprised me with his total) of walleye/pickeral using worm harnesses/leeches/minnows on a bottom bouncer.   Also worth the look at a photograph of this yacht that pulled into the Tobermory habour....about half the size of the cheecheemon.....some huge boats pull in there!  Off Dyers Bay the government docks used to be good to launch and head out for salmon/trout trolling......Back in the bay in OwenSound the salmon derby is starting and I'm not sure how far up the pennisula they go chasing salmon and trout to enter in that derby?  Don't really hear too much about trolling for salmon and trout off Tobermory and I wouldn't consider that area too good for bass/pickeral/pike along the shore line structure.   Inland lakes are okay, but nothing too spectacular."
