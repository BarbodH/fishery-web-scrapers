241780,charlesn,2008-08-21 00:06:00,551,"Maybe it's not that we're getting worse, but could the difference from 84 to now also have something to do with a lot of the less industrially developed countries getting to a point where they can focus on athletics?  I would look at China foremost as an example since I don't recall them being such a power in so many events back when I was a youth but now they are world-class in just about everything.  Australia has a big advantage over us since they are bred from the biggest and baddest of the criminals of the British empire...  lol  JUST KIDDING!  I mean sure India has precious few medals for their population, but what percentage of that population lives in poverty?  How many of them care that they won their first medal in boxing ever?  How many of them would trade that medal in a millisecond for a bowl of rice for their kids?  Sure I'd like to see Canada win some more medals, but I'd rather they put money in to our economy or towards getting the gas prices down because in the long run, whether Canada has 50 medals or 5, it ain't putting food on my table or fish in my livewell or really even affecting how much I love my country.  Charles  P.S.  I'd write more but I have to go eat a Big Mac to make up for misfish to preserve the Law of Conservation of Mass."
241788,John Bacon,2008-08-21 00:38:00,3277," 1984 was also a boycott year.  The Russians and other Eastern Block countries (with the exception of Romania) were not present.  This resulted in an inflated medal count.  I don't think that China competed then either.  If they did, they weren't the power house that they are now."

Its also a health issue.  When I went to school we had Gym class every day.  Then it went to three times a day.  Now in schools Gym is Optional if they even have it.  Kids now a days participate in Sports but don't compete in sports.  Unfortunately I also seen the deterioration in fitness in the Army Too.  No more Calistinics Bad for the knees, instead aerobics with music.  No more running in Combat Boots, bad for the legs.  The Standard Fitness level has also deteriorated since the augmentation of Females in the Combat trades.  Not so Bad in the Combat Trades but there are an awful lot of Fat Soldiers in Uniform that cant do their Duties.  As far as the Olympics, like I said if the money is the Problem, I would prefer to give it to the Sport than lets say//Culturism.  Maybe it doesnt put food on the table, but maybe it will save you money by not spending it on health issues."
241879,danc,2008-08-21 04:24:00,4677," This is not the time to whine about our athletes. In fact, this is the time to praise them. As a Canadian, I couldn't be more proud of our effort and that medals that we've won. Out of 208 weeks, you have 206 of them to state your complaints without disrupting our achievements. Please exercise that time frame. Attached is a graphic that should give you some motivation.   "
241882,holdfast,2008-08-21 04:57:00,1813,"Hey, never did complain about our achievements, or our atheletes.  Where the Heck did I complained about them.   What I have been saying is that we should be doing better, and could do better.  We are not just a so called Winter Nation or any other excuse.  You may be satisfied, I aint, thats all."
240236,darsky,2008-08-16 15:19:00,586,Congrats to TC for the 3 medals today. Great job!!!  More to come

240240,cranks bait,2008-08-16 15:45:00,721,Team Canada for WHAT?  Seriously.  I have not had time to follow any of the Olympics.  I need a little more help.  Boxing? Swimming? Biking? Ribbon Twirling?

240748,gone_fishin,2008-08-18 03:50:00,481," No, no, no.... Beer drinking, BBQing, and Donut eating!"
241472,Greencoachdog,2008-08-20 02:31:00,8163,Team Canada is up to 13 medals now... not too shabby!!!
241474,gone_fishin,2008-08-20 03:01:00,481," doesn't quite compare to the US's 79, but not bad for a country that focuses on mostly winter sports i guess. lol."
241488,holdfast,2008-08-20 04:07:00,1813,"See that's the Problem.  We don't and shouldn't focus on Winter Sports.  Its also no Excuse.  What you Cant weight lift, Play Volleyball, Swim, Run, Play soccer, Basketball, Gymnastics, indoor during the Winter.  We should be Competing with Australia, Poland and so on for medals.  One or two Gold Medals is not satisfying, we, this Nation has a problem when it comes to Competitions and fitness.  My kids got medals for participating because somehow its not productive to have a winner and a second place.  We are SOFT and Getting Worse."
241501,SlowPoke,2008-08-20 09:45:00,2984,"Oh yeah, it's that two and half week period when so many Canadians pretend to give a crap about the ""Modern Pentathalon"" and ""Synchronized Swimming"". I can't wait for the opening ceremonies to celebrate the commencement of the quadrannual inquest as to why our nations athletes continue to underperform. We'll hear about underfunded athletes. We'll hear about poor media coverage. We'll hear about .... Three weeks from now, it will all be forgotten. I find it odd that so many people can become so passionate about sport only to suppress their emotions for 200+ weeks. -Brian"
241509,Greencoachdog,2008-08-20 11:58:00,8163,"  I prefer to look at it on a per capita basis. Your country has 30 million people, the U.S. has 300 million. Your 13 medals would be 130 compared to the U.S. 79.  In my opinion the poorest per capita showing for a country is India with 2 medals for 1+ billion people"
241636,gone_fishin,2008-08-20 17:00:00,481, that would make sense! and that is definitely a poor showing for India... not that India has ever done very well at the olympics... i just looked up their history and the most medals they have ever won in a single year is 2!
241640,douG,2008-08-20 17:15:00,2693,"Our bronze medal hurdler, Priscilla Lopes - Schliep, who is 5'4"", bench presses 210 and can squat 300 lbs."
241724,holdfast,2008-08-20 22:13:00,1813,"  1984 Olympics at the LA games Canada had 44  If your going to play the Per Capita game, what would it give to the Aussies"
241727,Greencoachdog,2008-08-20 22:19:00,8163, With a population of 20 million and 36 medals... they're actually the leaders on a per capita basis!!!  GO OZSTRALIA!!!    ... and I'll bet she could pinch yer schnizzle off if she didn't like what you were doin!!!
241728,danc,2008-08-20 22:27:00,4677," Who really cares? All that I know for sure is that these medal winners dedicate their entire lives to their sport and put their entire heart and sole and everything else that they have into it. I watched most of them win their medals and I get most as emotional as the athletes themselves when they win.  Those of you that think that we should be winning more medals should know that the next summer Olympics is only four years away, and that track shoes usually go on sale in the fall."
241737,Greencoachdog,2008-08-20 22:49:00,8163,"  Well since Great Britian still kinda owns Canada, I'm sure they wouldn't mind if you claimed their medals too... for a grand total of 49 medals...  ... if that would make you feel better... because I know how much you love the British!!!"
241741,holdfast,2008-08-20 22:55:00,1813,"Dan C  , And you just confirmed what Ive been saying all along.  WHO Cares.  Certainly you don't.  As far as I'm concerned.  WE SHOULD DO BETTER.  It all starts with our youth.  Maybe you Advocate no physical training in Schools, or everybody gets a ribbon because we don't want to hurt the non winner feelings, or we don't compete attitude because it causes dissension, how about winning is not important (Bull).  As a very active person all my life and seeing today's youth go through the Military.  I think you better care.  We have a problem and its showing.  Im not satisfied with 2 Gold at this point, if it takes money, Ill be happy to transfer some funds from Arts and Culturism for todays youth.  Yea if I had the Talent I would buy a new pair of shoes, I was never afraid to work hard for anything and settle for nothing."
241742,Greencoachdog,2008-08-20 23:03:00,8163,   If they ever make squawking on the internet an Olympic Sport...   ... you'll have your gold!
241748,danc,2008-08-20 23:13:00,4677," You've missed my point entirely. My ""who cares"" is about our medal count. Isn't that what you're ranting about?  ""One or two Gold Medals is not satisfying, we, this Nation has a problem when it comes to Competitions and fitness.""  Like I said, track shoes...."
241757,Greencoachdog,2008-08-20 23:33:00,8163,  I think he'd actually make a better synchronized swimmer Dan!... Picture HF upsidedown in the water kicking his legs in the air...
