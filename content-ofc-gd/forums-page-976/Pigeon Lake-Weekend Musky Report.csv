241646,Meely,2008-08-20 17:36:00,282,"Hello Gang,  Sorry for the late report.....  Had friends come up to the lake with hopes of trying our Musky luck again last weekend. Man oh man was the fishing tuff. We fished for 5 hours Saturday and managed nothing but one major ""SWIPE"" at our lures. Boated NADDA !  Sunday, we tried our luck again and hit nothing for the first 3 hours. We then decided to try our luck on another section of the lake and within 30 mins, we boated 2 nice skis and one gorgeous pic. The pic weighed in just over 7 pounds and smacked a 10 inch believer. Unreal !!  Here are the pics:          Thanks for reading,  Meely"

241764,ehg,2008-08-20 23:40:00,2666,"At least you caught some decent fish there on Sunday. Congrats!  Was up there on Saturday as well and caught no muskies that day as well. Trolled the deep water north of Big Island for a few hours, before the wind blew up and forced us down to the back channel. Tried for bass with the usual spnnerbaits and topwaters on good spots. Nada! Caught some bass on grubs/jig rippin weeds however.  Think i saw youse guys, we were in reddish brown tinny up by Hurricane Point. No one else was really fishing there on a Saturday in mid- August.  Nice fish anyways, ehg"
