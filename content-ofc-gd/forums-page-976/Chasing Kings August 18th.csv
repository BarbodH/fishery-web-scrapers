241335,Jen,2008-08-19 18:13:00,833,Thanks for the congrats guys.  This season has been totally awesome for me personally with one fish after another.  I would have made number 10 on the list but I knew that there would be bigger fish caught... Although it would have been awesome to send a copy of it to my Brother... hehehe  A couple of days more to fish before the Derby is over... one never knows what will come next...  Life doesn't get any better when out on the water enjoying every moment that passes.  Cheers Jen
241337,kemper,2008-08-19 18:16:00,2232,Fish are starting to look darker...not too long until I can drift skein in the harbour and battle a king with 150 yards of line out on the pin!  What a rush!  great fish
