I am 18 and remember my first fish like it was yesterday, I was younger than the little guy and strapped into a carseat off the side of the road at cranberry marsh in Whitby. It was a catfish.  Those who know the area know that you cannot park there anymore because somone got killed at the side of the road, its WAY more busy now..."
