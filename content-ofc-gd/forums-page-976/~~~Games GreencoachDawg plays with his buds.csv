Finally, one woman turned to the other and said"" ""You know, I've been sitting here so long, my butt fell asleep!.""  The other woman turned to her and said: ""I know! I heard it Snoring!"""
241770,Greencoachdog,2008-08-20 23:49:00,8163,"Oldfart  and Sam, two elderly friends, met in the park every day to feed  the  pigeons, watch  the squirrels and discuss world  problems.  One  day Oldfart didn't show up. Sam  didn't think much about it and  figured maybe he had a cold  or something. But  after Oldfart hadn't shown up for a week or  so, Sam really  got worried. However,  since the only time they ever got together  was at the park, Sam  didn't know where Oldfart lived, so he was unable to find  out what had happened  to him.  A  month had passed, and Sam figured he had seen the last of  Oldfart, but one  day, Sam approached the park and -- low  and behold! --there sat Oldfart!  Sam was very excited  and happy to see him and told him so. Then he said,   'For crying out loud Oldfart, what in the world happened to  you?'  Oldfart replied, 'I have been in  jail.' 'Jail?'  cried Sam. 'What in the world for?' 'Well,'  Oldfart said, 'you know Sue, that cute little blonde waitress  at the coffee shop where I sometime go?'  'Yeah,' said Sam, 'I remember her. What about  her?'  'Well, one day she filed rape charges against  me; and, at 89 years old, I  was so proud that when  I got into court, I pled 'guilty' 'The  damn judge gave  me 30 days for perjury.'"
