242162,Clampet,2008-08-22 01:55:00,1947,"Awesome report GCD!! I like the way you explain the finder soundings.  That tree on the hump did look like a good spot. The Blue cat, can reach some good size I hear."

242247,Roy,2008-08-22 10:52:00,13728,Great report Glen. Glad you're getting good use of your structure finder. Your pics seem to be getting better with every report. Have you changed cameras?
242248,Victor,2008-08-22 11:06:00,1609," Ditto. I have a feeling that your PM box will be full in a few hours filled with ""No shirt please"", ""Why the %#$@ you wearing a shirt?"" messages.  Good to see you out catching still!"
