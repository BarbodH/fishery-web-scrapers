So I loaded my kit in the van and had the chauffeur dump me at the local pond Where I would meet some friends.  It did not take long to zero in on a good spot with a school pushing past our offerings every 15 minutes. We'd get 3-4 in quick succession then wait for the next attack. That went on for the next 8 hours. Many of the perch were cookie cutter fish in size and shape. Rockfish and his best of the day:   A few white perch that came to play   The next group of dinner guests   Of the 70 or so fish that were caught, 20 were kept"
302631,RickOnt,2009-02-07 02:15:00,669,That will be a VERY tasty Dinner!!!  Rick
302634,rockfish,2009-02-07 02:24:00,91,Getting lots of those dinner guests for another big fish fry Bruce.   I missed the morning fish but came out for the afternoon shift as I usually like to.
302648,Leecher,2009-02-07 02:52:00,7832,"Good job Bruce  Tell me, what's the bait of choice for them guest of yours?  Have you tried Gulp fish fry yet? Jacques"
302651,snag,2009-02-07 02:59:00,1932,Mmmmmmmm
302669,bigugli,2009-02-07 03:15:00,6138, Shinners and small pond chubs. Haven't tried the Gulp fry yet. The local store doesn't carry it. Might get some at the Fishing Show
302677,Leecher,2009-02-07 03:33:00,7832, Live shinners or small chubs really works great!!  Keep them reports coming  Hope you can get one at the show and try it out.... that stuff is lethal
302907,Joeytier,2009-02-07 20:11:00,3990,Are white perch the same thing as white bass?  They look quite similar to the ones I catch on Lake Ontario
302911,Greencoachdog,2009-02-07 20:31:00,8163," Not exactly, White Perch aren't really even a Perch, they're of the Temperate Bass family.  White Perch and White Bass are cousins (with the White Bass being the bigger of the two) and have been know to hybridize with each other.  White Perch= Morone americana  White Bass= Morone chrysops"
302915,misfish,2009-02-07 20:46:00,29133,Nice Bruce. What do the white perch taste like?Is there a difference between them and the yellow?
302918,Greencoachdog,2009-02-07 20:54:00,8163," White Perch taste similar to the White Bass and Striped Bass, not as mild as the Yellow Perch... but still real good eatin'!"
302933,The Urban Fisherman,2009-02-07 21:41:00,2050,Right on dude - very jealous.
303281,limeyangler,2009-02-08 15:19:00,5204,Nice going Bruce.  70 fish!!! Busy morning .  I had a couple lakers nibble at my 'fish fry' yesterday.   Good Job
303362,rockfish,2009-02-08 18:51:00,91,"Think Bruce has still been out in the slush the last couple days and trying the hard water.  The main difference between White Perch and White Bass (usually called ""silvers"") is that the Silver's 2 dorsal fins are not connected and the White Perch dorsals are connected. Not too sure on how they taste as compared to Yellow's cuz when u go to Bruce's fish frys, everything is covered in beer batter and everything taste good.  "
