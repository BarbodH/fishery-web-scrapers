303819,muskeybugged,2009-02-09 16:26:00,282,"Good question I thought.....  I drive through on my way to my weekend spot.  My bait shop is closed for the winter. Could of used some live minnows for the skunking we got this weekend. No response, strange. bump"
303821,kemper,2009-02-09 16:31:00,2232,"Not sure if its open in the winter but in the summer I go to the one just over the causeway on the way up the hill to Island Road.  No idea what its called, but I remember going there as a kid with my dad and the guy sold minnows/worms out of his garage I think. There may be better/worse options but I just go there out of habit"
303832,ricoboxing,2009-02-09 17:08:00,398, thats the only one ive been to. i think its called causeway bait and tackle
303895,e-z-out,2009-02-09 18:56:00,1052,  Your right thats what it's called. so far thats the only place i have gone this year for minnows.
303907,Ramble,2009-02-09 19:44:00,713,"i saw a sign for another place on the island, but i haven't been. Causeway is altight...little expensive, but a few dollars for minnows is worth it in my opinion i dont mind paying. He sells pinheads by the scoop, and shiners and dace by the dozen. I prefer the dace over the shiners. As i recall the dace were a little more expensive then the shiners.  Hoep that helps. -Dave"
