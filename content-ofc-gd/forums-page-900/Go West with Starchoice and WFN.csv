Looks like the wife and I are gonna be headed out to Vancouver Island this coming summer for 3 days of guided fishing in the Pacific Ocean for Salmon and Halibut. Here is a link to the resort we will be staying at. www.canadianprincess.com  Has anyone ever been on one of these trips that could tell me what we should pack and also what we should expect.  Thanks Nate  Oh yeah the fishing gear and $500 in food is included too."

283068,Hubbard,2008-12-23 02:37:00,22,"I know it's pretty sureal that I won I can't even explain how I feel because I have never won anything at all.  Funny thing is I never even considered entering the contest but thought to myself whats it gonna hurt to enter? now I am in the process of picking a date to go and confirming my flight, I also have not looked at the WFN website to see if they put my name up as the contest winner yet."
284625,Hubbard,2008-12-28 03:58:00,22,"Does anyone know what I should be expecting fishing wise out on the West Coast, I have never been out there and was wondering if anyone has been out there fishing for halibut & Salmon. Sorry to bring up an old thread but I am going crazy thinking about what to expect. Thanks Nate"
284633,BillM,2008-12-28 04:32:00,17367,Summer time = very good chance at catching a 50+ lb Chinook..  You are going to have an awesome time!
284784,Tom McCutcheon,2008-12-28 17:36:00,627,"Bring your appetite!!!  Probably rain gear and warm clothing. It can get chilly in the morning I bet. Most of the shows I have seen from out there, the clients were all wearing survival suits which I believe were supplied by the outfitter. Check with the outfitter they will tell you what you need.  Congratulations, catch a big one. If you tie into one of those halibut bring your muscles and a masseuse."

303628,Bly,2009-02-09 01:46:00,1556,"Congratulations!   Don't forget your camera!   Sorry, that is the only advice I can offer.   I hope you and your wife have a wonderful time!"

Its amazing there... sea lions swimming around right at the cleaning station. all shorts of beautiful scenery!  We picked the wrong guys to take us out and we were skunked the first 2 times out and finally picked up a good guide and landed 3, 30+lbs salmon !  Plus he took us to his shrimp traps and gave us a wack load of shrim for free !  I think your REALLY going to enjoy it, The best part about it is its.... FREEEEEEEE ! haha good luck !"
