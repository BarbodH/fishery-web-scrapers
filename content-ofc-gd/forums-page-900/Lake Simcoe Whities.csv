303386,Beans,2009-02-08 19:54:00,3339,Bring the lad out to the Fishing for Tyler Event at Innisfil Beach Park on Saturday 14 February...  Lots of good prizes in the draw after the fish winners have chosed theirs...  Williams Wablers or Williams Jigging spoons will catch both whitefish or Lake Trout as will Meegs/BadBoyz jigs...
