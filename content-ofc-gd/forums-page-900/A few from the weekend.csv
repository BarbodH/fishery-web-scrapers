Hit it up Friday on an exporatory mission, basically to make sure there was a trail in and to check for conditions of the lake. Everything was fine, a little slush but nothing to bother about. Ended up going about 7 miles up the lake till I hit a bottle neck between the 2 main basins. Set up shop. Action wasn't bad but not great either. Fished from 11 till 2 each day. Heres a pic or 2. All fish swam away          And heres a shot of my sidekick working hard to get one! "

303523,brkygetr,2009-02-08 23:54:00,425,I was in 35 ft of water where that pic is taken...I had holes out to 80 ft of water and that was only a matter of 15 yds further out. Nice steep drop.
