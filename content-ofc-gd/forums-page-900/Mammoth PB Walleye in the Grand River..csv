259878,gogu392,2008-10-20 01:06:00,142," Nope, from a rented old 10 "" aluminium boat. That fish put a nice fight. I had all the line 100m in the water when I got him. I was lucky to have a good line (braid 15LB) but the hook almost give me up. Was twisted and bended. I did not expect to hook such fish. Actualy is my first ever walleye.  As I said no fish finder."
260030,kennyman,2008-10-20 17:30:00,737,Sweet! Nice Eye Rap's. Beautiful colour. I drive over that bridge every Wednesday LOL.
303508,Paloon,2009-02-08 23:41:00,4,Wow what a fish...I've often wondered if the eyes come up this far upriver.  I've heard of eyes in the brantford area of the grand and the nith but not Cambridge.  And I can attest that it is in fact Cambridge as I recognize the old restaurant in the background.  What time of year was the beast caught?  Lets hope that there is a resident walleye population in the Cambridge area.
257924,jrego7,2008-10-13 04:39:00,37,"Got off work early on friday. Decided to go fishing. So I went out and spent some time catching a dozen minnows. Headed out to the Grand. Within a few seconds I was getting hits like crazy and also getting robbed. So I switched it up to a larger hook and Bamn started hooking into some fish. Landed a 2 lb walleye and a few smallies. One at about 1.5 lbs. I saved 2 minnows for a spot. Within minutes I get slammed in the rapid's, I'm like omg! What a BEAST! Within 20 seconds the fish was sucked dry of energy lol. It weighed 6.5 lbs and measured in at 26 1/4 inches.  http://img403.imageshack.us/my.php?image=img1118bd8.jpg  http://img122.imageshack.us/my.php?image=img1117cz1.jpg"

259680,gogu392,2008-10-19 12:05:00,142,"Talking about big walleye the below one is my catch in Bay Of Quinte on 12 May 2008. 4+ Kg - 9lb. I think is impresive mainly because I don't own a boat, not even a kayak, neither fancy fishing tools (fish finder, electric motor a.s.o.) Will take me sone years to get those but I will catch up some day. "
259708,Beats,2008-10-19 14:13:00,543,  You caught that fish from shore??
