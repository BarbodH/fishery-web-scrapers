303432,douG,2009-02-08 21:35:00,2693,Have you got an unbalanced load on the spin cycle?  Redistribute your stuff so it is evenly loaded around the basket.
303448,richyb,2009-02-08 21:59:00,774,"  No , I took out the load of laundry that was in it and put that wet stuff in the shower. I also drained out the water that was in there and tried to start over , it will put in about 2 inches of water then the lights flash and then it spurts little shots of water.   Thanks for the replys guys , I think ill go try sinkers solution of kicking it."

Google ""Kenmore washer light flashes"" or something like and you will probably find something helpful. There is really not a lot to appliances so if you have any mechanical ability at all and the right info you've got a fighting chance. Good luck, Jim"
