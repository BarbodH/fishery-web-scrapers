302022,bigugli,2009-02-05 23:57:00,6138,My kids made me try it on a dare. Only got 25 ft down the hill and a week to put my hip back in place
302079,Zubris21,2009-02-06 01:31:00,563,"Stay with rentals unless you really get into it.  The lines may be long to pick them up but the prices are typically reasonable and the equipment decent.   Make sure you take a lesson at least the first time you go.  It will take some getting used to of course.  Don't get frustrated trying to make you way around on the flats at the bottom of the hill.  It can be pretty tiring if your not use to it.  Once your at the top its easy, just point your skis downhill and let gravity do the rest!  Seriously, wide sweeping turns with a bit of a snowplow should manage your pace well enough.  One word of caution, Do not stop halfway down the run just over a lip.  I've nearly ran into many inexperienced skiers taking a break in a blind spot.  Feel free to stop, just use common sense in choosing your location.  Same goes if (when) you fall!  grab your gear and get it on quick or head to the side of the run."
302102,Nemo,2009-02-06 01:55:00,727,Take it easy and take a lesson. It's more fun that way.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac7l2Y2OogM
302386,NBR,2009-02-06 17:36:00,163,"Misfish,Take a lesson. I believe most recreational ski injuries occur in the first weeks, months or years of snow skiing. Yes, balance is similar except on the snow your weight needs to be distributed forward and turning is much different. My wife and I met snow skiing. I quit a few years ago but she is still at in something like year 48. Actually she is in Idaho right now finishing up a weeks trip. From there she goes to Colorado to visit with our son and his family and ski a few days.  When she gets back she is an instructor for an Adaptive program. This is a program for the handicapped. She will be skiing until shortly before we get ice out then she can mind the house while I fish.  If I remember correctly Irishfield was or is an instructor and can probably point you in the right direction. "
302410,Headhunter,2009-02-06 18:34:00,5703,"Ok... my turn... my wife and I used to ski.Did I enjoy it? Well truthfully this is what I found... I would freeze my   off going up on the lift. I would then sweat my    off going down the hill... repeat ad nauseum! Got old pretty fast! Worst part for me was standing on top of Blue Mountain, looking at that beautiful forzen bay and wondering how many fish I could be catching, if I was out on the ice... that and it's really hard to keep yer jig on the bottom, when your tavelling up on the lift! HH"
302412,BillM,2009-02-06 18:42:00,17367,"Can't give any advice on skiing, tried it once been snowboarding ever since (17 years and counting)  Wayne, lots of idiot's out there!  I've seen both kinds"
302421,Cast-Away,2009-02-06 19:18:00,790,"Brian, My wife and I have been skiing at Snow Valley for the past seven years while the kids are in lessons. They have an 8 winter weekend lesson program, so we have always made a day of it. This way the kids get to practice what they learned and have lots of fun while making the most out of our long Canadian winters.  Snow Valley has over 350 instructors and offers a great intro package. It is called Discover skiing. For $40 you get a rental package, 75 minute lesson and a 4 hour lift ticket for the bunny hill, which is all that you need for the first time out. If she likes it, you can go back for the Discover skiing 2 package. If she is comfortable, the instructor will take her on the longer runs.  They are the most flexible family orientated ski operation in all of Ontario. My 15 year old daughter became an instructor there this year after allot of training and full certification. She loves the job and loves the staff there. There are very professional people and really nice to all of their customers. You can't go wrong with this resort!"
302422,Flappn,2009-02-06 19:25:00,245,"I agree with some others, take a lesson. Even one will be a huge help. After that lesson you will be able to have a full day of FUN skiiing."
302423,Headhunter,2009-02-06 19:25:00,5703,Forgot to mention that Sport Check has all their ski equipment on sale at half price this weekend! HH
302431,misfish,2009-02-06 20:20:00,29133,"Im not buying nothing til I see if I like it.LOL Thanks all for your input.  I have heard great things about Snow valley .  Guess we,ll see what happens.  Thanks again."
302432,super dave,2009-02-06 20:21:00,323,My advice is make sure you have a helmet.  Dont want to have a serious head injury first time out. Position your skis into a V shape and put pressure on your right leg to turn left.  I snowboard now but thats what I remember when I used to ski.
302441,misfish,2009-02-06 20:50:00,29133," Yep,thats a given. I dont have the long flowing blond hair anymore."
302492,irishfield,2009-02-06 22:35:00,26272, Come on Joe... that ice ain't safe....not today anyhow!
303792,Paulus,2009-02-09 15:10:00,522," I can't agree more. In fact, lessons at any time, no matter how (in)experienced you are, are a good idea. I started skiing at 11, and although I had lessons at the beginning, I didn't try any new lessons until I was 25. I had accumulated several bad habits that, when removed, made me a much, much better skier.  The best skiing East of the Rockies is in Quebec, IMO. Mont Sainte-Anne and Le Massif are the best. Tremblant is ok, but it's owned by Intra-West (the same people who over-charge for lift tickets at Blue Mountain), so I avoid it.  I shouldn't say ""avoid."" I haven't been skiing since 2002 - which is when I came back from living in Switzerland for 2 years. I'm still suffering from the withdrawal; and now that I have a little family of my own... well... you know the drill  Anyway, some advice: Take lessons, start with ski's (not snowboard... can be very hard on your wrists), don't be afraid to fall... in fact, fall sideways on purpose a few times to get the hang of it (it helps to know how to direct your fall, and getting up after a fall can be a skill in its own right), and take a break when you're tired (best way to avoid injury). Don't wear jeans or anything like that, as you just get wet and cold: gore-tex snow pants and coat etc.  Enjoy a couple of beers at the end of the day, too. For whatever reason, they taste better ONLY on a hot day, fishing... go figure.  p.-"
301920,misfish,2009-02-05 20:41:00,29133,"The mrs,s an I, have been doing things that we have not done. Well shes done more then I.Eating seafood for her. The one thing I have always wanted to try was downhill skiing. I know we can rent them and all that.  Just need some pointers on the do,s and dont,s."
301922,GBW,2009-02-05 20:44:00,8460,"Have you ever water skied before?  I ask for balance and movement.  And remember, you are never to old for a lesson!"
301923,Terry,2009-02-05 20:46:00,14456,"I hear one of the members here was the youngest instructors ever in Ontario, maybe the world    myself if I ever find a lake with a hill I will try it down hill"
301925,misfish,2009-02-05 20:47:00,29133," I use to water ski all the time. The difference to me is I could let go of the rope and go down EASY. Dont think when I go down on the hard stuff,it will be so nice.LOL"
301926,GBW,2009-02-05 20:53:00,8460,"Same idea of keeping your knees bent and using your hips and balance to turn.  just don't cross the tips!  going down, wait let me reword that...  falling down isn't so bad as long as you go to your butt/hip and keep your hands out front."
301928,tinbanger,2009-02-05 20:55:00,1028,"Brian Give Snow valley a try one night .Tuesday to Thursday are less busy ( closed monday) Good easy hills to start you off . gettin on off to wropes or lifts can ebe the hardest . they have group lesson at pretty resonable rates, includes rentals.  If you have ever had skis on before ( x country or water) it will help .  TB"
301929,Roy,2009-02-05 20:59:00,13728,"Brian me brudder! I could understand you and your sweetie wanting to go out and do different tings togedder but by de lard tunderin', don't be strappin' lumber to your feet an throwin yeseves off a cliff! How about snowshoes? Cross country skiing maybe? I wouldn't even be offended if ya curled!"
301930,misfish,2009-02-05 20:59:00,29133," Hey Im not OLD.  Lessons well yeah,they might come in handy. Wonder if they have them for the  first time mogal guys?"
301931,misfish,2009-02-05 21:04:00,29133," Roy, I phoned Hardwood hills about that me brudder. For some reason,they dont allow you to sling a shotgun for the wabbits.   Thats where I was thinking Dave. They have the tube run,but,I did that behind a boat too.Now thats pain if you wipeout."
301934,GBW,2009-02-05 21:10:00,8460,"just saying, as if someone told me to take snowboarding lessons 15 years ago I would have said no way.  But now, you bet I would."
301937,solopaddler,2009-02-05 21:16:00,8605,"When I first started dating my wife she was really into it, I used to go skiing with her all the time. Never had any lessons but I was a natural and managed quite well,  'till one day when my overconfidence got the best of me.  We were at Ellicotville (or Alcoholville as I liked to call it  ) and I somehow ended up at the brink of their black diamond trying to decide yay or nay.  It was pure ice, no powder and peppered with nasty little humps and bumps. Not even the experienced skiers were attempting it. I figured....why not?  Anyone remember the opening shots on Wide World Of Sports where they show that clip of Todd Brooker (or was it Podborski?) crashing at Kitzbuhel where he goes cartwheeling end over end? Well that was me  . That was the last time I ever went downhill skiing LOL!  (No relevance whatsoever to your question, but just thought I'd throw that in there  )"
301940,purekgw,2009-02-05 21:19:00,585,snowboarding is BETTER!
301941,Roy,2009-02-05 21:23:00,13728,Have you considered ice fishing maybe?
301942,snag,2009-02-05 21:23:00,1932,"If you can find a cheap pair of ski's and boots, buy them. It will cover the cost of renting and save you 3hrs waiting in line!"
301943,GBW,2009-02-05 21:24:00,8460,I agree.  This is my 1st year on ski's in over 15 years because my 5-year old daughter wants to learn how to ski because of her friends.

I tried skate boarding once,on the advice of my youngest. My first trick was a heel flip over a very low curb(dont ask how low) I went over alright. Yep two days off of work.   Ya know what Roy,were doing that next weekend.Hope it,s not to cold.LOL This weekend is bowling. Yeah I done that before,but it,s QUALITY TIME.   Seriously. I do want to do this. We,ll be heading there saturday to see what it,s all about.Not sure if she will do it,but Im sure she,ll have a warm coco and a soft pillow for me to sit on.  Yes, there will be pics and a vid. I wouldnt want to deprive you all from a good laugh."
301954,GBW,2009-02-05 21:45:00,8460,"Oh, I'll be up in Barrie this weekend so I might just have to go by Snowvalley...  It's not hard, snowplow for speed, knees and hips bent and your hands in front of you like you are on a bike.  Just don't cross your tips..."
301957,blaque,2009-02-05 21:51:00,2419," Man, you fish some of the same steelhead waters as I (the kitty,18) and ski the same slopes (holiday valley) and ive never run into you lol. Small world i guess.  Skiin is my second hobby after fishing,........well snowboarding now. I skiied for about 10 years and once they started getting rid of all the mogul runs around here (kissing bridge, holiday valley.......in ny) i switched to snowboarding. We used to ski the moguls non stop almost every run. But for some reason, they have diminished over the years. THat was really the only real fun i had on skiis........around here anywya. Killington VT. was another story.......much more challenging terrain. So i dunno, i got bored i guess you could say and switched to the board and havent looked back. I actualy found snowboarding easier to learn than skiing. Its tough to get the body language down, but once it clicks, its clicks. Its alot more fun in my opinion, and its not just for the young guys who can pull Wicked (the good wicked) phat (the good phat) sick (the good sick) tight moves out in the board park..........theres a ton of old guys out there carvin it up nowadays. Id strap the board on and go for it."
301959,kentooley,2009-02-05 21:52:00,208,"Do yourself a favor  and take a couple of lessons. I never did, and picked up bad habits that took a long time to break. They will also teach you how to fall so you don't do any damage to yourself.  Have Fun!"
301982,irishfield,2009-02-05 22:47:00,26272,"LOL.. like has been said.. take a lesson Brian, and NO I don't have the patience for it anymore and you're too big for me to ski backwards and have you hold my pole handles. Never really did have the patience.. it just got me on the slopes for free and I did have the quickest advancement from beginner to advanced in the Rideau Valley ski club .....as I believed the bunny hills were impossible to teach kids to ski on if they can't get any speed to glide/turn. I took them straight to Tiger Express, at Calabogie, about day 3 ! lol  As for ""Snowboarding is better"".... I'd just wish someone would tell them they're supposed to share the hill as well. All three of us.. wife, daughter and myself.. got pinged off last Sunday night at Blue. I'm still sore. We used to do stuff like that as kids.. crude plywood boards with bindings... broken skis cut off to what you would now call skates.. mono skis with a plate and two bindings.. and all of them got us thrown off the hills. Now they've found boards cut their grooming costs so let it rip !... just wish we had of patented some of that stuff...."
301996,Fisherman,2009-02-05 23:16:00,7201,I think at your age group you should stick to skis that have a steering device and brakes attached........snowmobile.

I've got a nice set of 3 year old stuff, I don't use anymore.... If you are a size 10-10.5 boot, roughly 175 lbs should save you a few bucks. Good luck!"
302018,mikemcmillan,2009-02-05 23:49:00,50,"Experience tells me to tell you to ask for short ski's, a lot easier to control, turn and stop. It is easier if your relaxed. just  mho. Oh and by the way have a great time.  KW Mike"
