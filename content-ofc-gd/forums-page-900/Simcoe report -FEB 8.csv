About a 1 km walk but good ice conditions made walkin ok .Even some adventurous types drove trucks out.  Only a few perch for our troubles , although some of us were't trying too hard  MNR out in force ( 3 officers on sleds) were busy checking huts and such .Stopping as many sleds and atvs as they could that were coming in from farther out .  We are right on the flight path for the Hales fleet , love the look and sound of these things"
