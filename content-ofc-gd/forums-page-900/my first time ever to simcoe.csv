302686,purekgw,2009-02-07 03:58:00,585,"Finally  got out to simcoe for a day on the ice left home around 3:30am and got there around 6ish after getting lost (thank god for GPS) made it to the hut started off slow then around 11ish picked up a bit with perch. Then went dead  for a couple hours with the odd perch and crisco (i think thats what there called) then finally tip up get a little action like something bumping it up so i slowly lift up on the tip up and boom took off like a dart starts to come up and turns out to be a nice whitey, after almost losing it like 6 times down the hole finally get it up and boom  the other tip up goes off set the hook and it didnt want to move was like a brick after a little while finally starts to come up can see a little tail and it decides it doesn't like going up so darts down and hes gone have no clue what it was but he didnt want to see the sun. Over all a good day ill take some pics of fish in morning   :thumbsup_anim:   "
