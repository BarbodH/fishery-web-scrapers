SOOOOOOOOOO durty.
303318,Sinker,2009-02-08 16:59:00,8692,I hate fireline just because of that mess.  PP doesn't do that at all!!  Sinker
303330,Guest skeeter99,2009-02-08 17:36:00,0,"  PP does leave a slight residue, very minimal after a few times out there is basically none"
303333,young_one,2009-02-08 17:42:00,620,"PP for me does not leave any residue, just the obvious colour fading over time. I use both red and green, summer and winter. Its truly the super line."

303408,Greencoachdog,2009-02-08 20:57:00,8163,"    I find Fireline to be extremely nasty with the residue!!!... I think that's why they call it Fireline.. because it looks like you've been in a fire after casting that stuff for a day!!!... black junk everywhere, on me, the boat, the fish...  PP and Spiderwire are much cleaner!"
303410,TroutnMuskieHunter,2009-02-08 21:00:00,1362,    How's your writing skills and spelling in French Kemper???
303413,Greencoachdog,2009-02-08 21:05:00,8163," I thought the same thing!  ... but you've gotta overlook the Kemp dude, he's one of those fancy schmancy college boys that pulls his pants down every time he has to take a pee."

303416,Fishing 24/7,2009-02-08 21:14:00,709,ok ok i have a spelling probleme!!!!!!!  thats beside the thread!  stop beeing an    HOLIO!  now if you have something usefull to add please do.  Bashing me right into pieces wont help the probleme.  pm'ing  me the errors will.
303418,Fishing 24/7,2009-02-08 21:16:00,709,SOOOOOOOO  i have to go buy pp now...........................................   to bad i stocked up on the fireline .....  sick of the mess it leaves so POWER PRO it is!  thanx guys.
303420,irishfield,2009-02-08 21:18:00,26272,Just make sure there's power pro in the box. I just went to respool my ice rod with 4lb thick/15lb test Power Pro ice and (after stripping my spool off) I find some pri ck swapped the spool in the box for 4 lb Trilene ice line to save $10 !
303425,kemper,2009-02-08 21:27:00,2232,"Apologise for earlier comment, I wasnt aware of the language business."
303426,kemper,2009-02-08 21:29:00,2232,"I guess i should add something useful as well, I have only fished the fireline once or twice but the PP is great stuff and not too bad for the residue. a quick cleaning always helps out"
303444,Fishing 24/7,2009-02-08 21:54:00,709,  no harm done!   i have enough with my mother correcting me all the time!   apologie accecpted!
303515,jace,2009-02-08 23:47:00,472,"they all have it except the uncolored white gel spun lines (the natural color of PE fiber).   I would say ""Original"" spiderwire is pretty light on the waxy teflon coating also.   it all wipes off pretty easy anyways so you should pick a line that works for you rather than going by which one leaves the least marks."
303532,Whitespinnerbait,2009-02-09 00:05:00,2038,Power Pro ...is the way to go   :thumbsup_anim:
303540,Leecher,2009-02-09 00:12:00,7832,I second and third that
303564,Mike the Pike,2009-02-09 00:38:00,3421,I find fireline has too much slippige braid is the way to go in summer no good for winter as it freezes up.
303649,Maverick,2009-02-09 02:08:00,371,"I started using Fireline when it first came out, then switched to Berkley Whiplash. Whiplash is the best line I have ever used, never faded and was always strong. Had the same spool for 4 years and it was still as good as new. Conveniently they stopped making the Whiplash so I switched to Power Pro. I've used Spiderwire and the Stren braid but I still like Power Pro. It is a cleaner and rounder line.  I've heard good things about the P-Line braid, I will be trying a spool of that this season, anybody use the P-Line?"
303662,msp,2009-02-09 02:26:00,1336,Diawa has a new braid out this year. It looks really good. It is way more limp than Power Pro and Fireline. I think that I will give it a try. I use Fireline and Powerpro and have noticed that I get more residue from the P.P. It doesnt really bother me that much. I feel that each line has their advantages. I like both.
