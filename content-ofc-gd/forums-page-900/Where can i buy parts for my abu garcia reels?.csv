303301,jace,2009-02-08 15:57:00,472,"The ceramic replacement pawls are smoother than the stock metal ones...look for them.   Mike's reel repair on the west coast sells them through mail and on ebay.  sticking on the sides is a sure sign of a worn pawl.  If this is a fairly new reel, it might be from not cleaning the reel enough or not enough lube.  Dirt gradually gets pushed to the ends of the worm gear where it grinds away at the pawl and that will wear it out on any reel pretty fast."
303302,john vail,2009-02-08 16:01:00,67,go to their website you can order parts and download scamatics for your reel
303315,kemper,2009-02-08 16:53:00,2232,"Sounds like a worm gear to me, I had one go on me last season.  Not sure where you can get parts though, I gave up and just sent it in."
303319,Fishing 24/7,2009-02-08 17:00:00,709,   worm gear??????????   were is that located on the reel?  inside?  i just ordered the new pawl.  the ceramic sounds SWEEEEEEET!
303320,Sinker,2009-02-08 17:02:00,8692,"I usually have one or two of those go each season between a few abu casting reels.  I just buy a bunch of them, and replace them as I need them. They're cheap.  Sinker"

303327,irishfield,2009-02-08 17:19:00,26272,Well don't order online from Mike's reel repair on the west coast. Been waiting since Dec 15 for the handle retainer for my 700B that fell apart on the Niagara on the 13th. Can't even get them to return an email...
303331,TroutnMuskieHunter,2009-02-08 17:38:00,1362,"  Wayne...if you want, I'll talk to the folks at reel to reel and see if they have the part that you need!!...then I'll mail it to you.."
303337,irishfield,2009-02-08 17:43:00,26272,Thanks Steve... gonna give this guy a bit. First it was confirmed.. then back ordered.. then can't get a reply. Muskie openers a bit off yet...  Sad part is it's only $1.65 worth of parts and $7 postage! lol
303343,Whitespinnerbait,2009-02-08 18:03:00,2038,Notice how you don't see too many dudes looking where they can their Shimano reels repaired.....  Thats because their bullet proof...  :worthy:   And were always out...
303421,Fishing 24/7,2009-02-08 21:20:00,709,   you should look into those ceramic pawls... shimano makes them to!
303422,Fishing 24/7,2009-02-08 21:21:00,709,  wehere do you stock up on them?
303566,OhioFisherman,2009-02-09 00:44:00,6623,"I usually have one or two of those go each season between a few abu casting reels.  I have older Abu reels and have never had one go, one of the easiest spots on a reel to lube.  About the same amount of problems with my Abu`s as my Shimano`s, none."
303701,Sinker,2009-02-09 03:49:00,8692," I get the guy at my local tackle shop to get them for me. He can get anything!  Kawartha Lakes Bait and Tackle  I got $10 worth from him, and its nice little bag full. Takes 2 seconds to change them. The worm gear is the bar that the pawl runs back and forth across. AFter a while, they will wear out too. Keep that part of the reel clean and well oiled. I take it off and run a sfety pin thru the gears.......you'd be surprised how much crap comes outta there.
