303679,Sinker,2009-02-09 02:59:00,8692,"Yep, they're still frozen  Sinker"
303683,kemper,2009-02-09 03:03:00,2232,my buddy was telling me they were still locked up.  They will probably be open by mid next week....and BLOWN if i had to guess
303690,okumasheffield,2009-02-09 03:27:00,318,"I was hoping someone would say all rivers are open and somewhat blown ... in which, means I can finally wash my fishing gears sometime next week for the first time in months .."
303692,Sinker,2009-02-09 03:34:00,8692,"I'll bet that they don't even blow out next week with the rain they're calling for.  First of all, the weather guys are always wrong, and it prolly won't even rain. Second of all, if it does get mild with rain, it will prolly flow ON TOP of the ice thats there now. There is about a foot of ice on those tribs.........not easy to bust that stuff up in one thaw!!  Any takers??  Sinker"
303696,BillM,2009-02-09 03:39:00,17367,"There is always open water somewhere, you just need to find it"
303698,Sinker,2009-02-09 03:41:00,8692,Fish also swim under the ice!!! Drill a hole!!!!!!  Sinker
303703,okumasheffield,2009-02-09 03:57:00,318,Dont ask me why but I have always had fears about walking/standing/fishing on ice ...  I can swim .. but still ..
303705,kemper,2009-02-09 04:04:00,2232,"on a side note the 'geen and the sauble are probably somewhat fishable.  I can think of one other place, but im NOT givin that up"
303864,diggyj,2009-02-09 18:22:00,548,  I agree with Bill. There is always open water somewhere. It's just a matter of how bad you want it.
303872,okumasheffield,2009-02-09 18:29:00,318,"Ok, I will admit I am desperate. Please PM me!"
303881,BillM,2009-02-09 18:42:00,17367,"Go fish the Geen, check the flow charts out.  Just watch the ice shelves.  Although with all this warm weather it's probably blown anyhow."
303886,BITEME,2009-02-09 18:45:00,1968,Bows and Browns were had on silver williams jigging spoons on saturday Sunday the on the concrete same on bags river was getting kinda green will most likely be trashed today
303899,jwl,2009-02-09 19:09:00,1056,tonnes of chrome on the big river I fish
303927,Paully,2009-02-09 20:54:00,712,The east is still frozen solid... On my way home today i noticed the little Rouge river has  snow mobile tracks up and down the river! Are they even allowed to be in the rouge?... is'int it a park?
303995,Joeytier,2009-02-09 22:27:00,3990,"The small creek behind my house(pringle creek in whitby) is open in the faster.  It will be entirely open after the next two days of 7-8 degree weather I'm sure.  With any luck, Oshawa will be fishable Friday."
304000,Guest steel'n'esox,2009-02-09 22:31:00,0,"some open water on rivers with harbours, where the wave action keeps things from freezing, on some rivers up to 18 inches of ice no fears for walking on that stuff, take lots of warm weather and rain to open things up, as sinker said next week at the earliest, fish around but still spotty"
