Around 10:00am I decided to add a couple small hooks above my Buckshot with Spikes, it was non stop Smelt. I fished right off bottom and was hauling in 2 Smelt at a time ...around 11:00am I called it a day with about 200 or so SMELT ...I saw 2 Walleye  on the ice today on the way back in...  If you would like to get the Kids out for some fun and fast action head out in the Marina or the River as it's packed full of Smelt ...  "
