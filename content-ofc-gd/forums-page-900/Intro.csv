303305,chiefcat,2009-02-08 16:23:00,3,"Hello everyone! I've followed this board for some time now and am very impresssed with the variety of fishing and comraderie. I have fished for over 40 years- no species preference, hard water or soft- doesn't matter. Last outing was a week ago on Simcoe- 12 whities and 1 laker between three of us... my son (13) got into 3 whities himself! As far as soft watergoes- have never owned a ""fishing boat"", just a good ol' 12-14 foot aluminum. I made the jump to a bigger boat   - 17 foot Tracker Super Pro 1991, 40 HP Johnson, fishfinder, trailer, 2 downriggers, 2-way radio for $4500. Stored every winter in a garage. What do you think?  ANY THOUGHTS ON WHAT SIZE BOW MOUNT TROLLING MOTOR?"

303615,Radnine,2009-02-09 01:32:00,1538,"It sounds like it could be a little under-powered, but on a positive note you will not need to buy a drift sock. Welcome aboard! Jim"
