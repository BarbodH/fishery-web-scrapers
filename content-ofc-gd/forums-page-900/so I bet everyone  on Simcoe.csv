303167,irishfield,2009-02-08 03:51:00,26272,Whitie blood...
303171,walleyemaster,2009-02-08 03:56:00,325,whitie blood?...should be white not red
303185,mikeh,2009-02-08 04:20:00,824,Terry how far off bottom were you fishing? thanks for the video.
303219,medmart,2009-02-08 11:09:00,587,Great video Terry. I was out with Lloyd yesterday and we where talking about how you where bad luck for getting skunked LOL i guess we where wrong BTW we found your skunk  Rob
303232,b2kptbo,2009-02-08 12:48:00,1505,Good work...
303237,Terry,2009-02-08 13:01:00,14456,"ok yes the white dot that was in the top right side most of the time is my jig  I did the best at about 10ft off bottom, but I tried from right on bottom to 15ft off bottom  it was close to the same spot last week  I can't believe Wayne gave my spot away, dang there will be 10000 fish that spot next week during the tourney  and last but not lest, lloyd will have nothing to talk about now, who's the ""female dog"" now.....be,ach...LOL"
303252,Moosebunk,2009-02-08 13:33:00,3970,Terry caught a fish....???? lol.  I like the skidoo/hut set-up.
303261,solopaddler,2009-02-08 14:11:00,8605,Nice fish! You're almost tempting me to hit Simcoe today....almost. (leaving shortly to fish some softwater).
303264,Terry,2009-02-08 14:22:00,14456,"dang I zoomed in and enlarged it and dang it really was my spot   <a href=""http://s25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/?action=view&current=spot1.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/spot1.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>     LOL...ok maybe not"
303266,mistyriver1,2009-02-08 14:27:00,600,"Good stuff Terry, congrats."
303456,Terry,2009-02-08 22:20:00,14456,thanks Jim
303796,icedude,2009-02-09 15:18:00,459,  good stuff Terry   nice choice of tunage too  Cheers  ID1
303998,fishnsled,2009-02-09 22:30:00,3520,WTG Terry! Nice fish.   I bet you're happy with the sled for getting around in all that slush on the weekend.  Good looking ride.
302954,Terry,2009-02-07 22:18:00,14456,"Because I did, and it had to be easy fishing for me to get them  I only caught 2 kept one to eat lost about 3 more but they were moving through the hole constantly  I had the camera down and  could see them quite well, it didn't help me catch them  I used a portable DVR to record the fish but I think I had the quality set too low because I could see the fish and my jig much better on the camera st up then on the computer when I checked them out  the camera was about 10 feet above my jig in 85 ft of water  I made up a movie the first 15 seconds is hard to see then it gets better  next time I hope it's better I have my spot marked for next weekend at fishing for Tyler  so my movie isn't real good but the song is worth while listening to            if you look hard you can see the puffs of dirt when the jig hits the ground fish check it out but don't bite "
302956,purekgw,2009-02-07 22:22:00,585,are those all white fish because when we where there yesterday there where about 10 right under us at one point we got a couple up and they were cisco
302958,irishfield,2009-02-07 22:22:00,26272,Did ya paint a Red X or something on the spot???  I'll probably be late getting there next week... but I'll try to find you.  Great shooting Terry... about time you washed that stripe off your back ! lol Lloyd will be proud!  !! !!
302962,Terry,2009-02-07 22:25:00,14456,they were whitefish I saw the ones on camera that I caught and they were just average size I was seeing not the bigger ones which I didn't catch so pretty sure they were whitefish
302965,Leecher,2009-02-07 22:27:00,7832,Great report and pics Terry  Nice looking whitie.... congratulations Thanks for sharing Leechman
302966,Greencoachdog,2009-02-07 22:30:00,8163,"Great report, pics, and the song was better than the vid... but I did some of the fish down there!!!  There musta been thousands of them down there for you to have such a banner day eh!  There is certain art to usin' the self timer button on the camera... butt you got it in the end!"
302969,tinbanger,2009-02-07 22:32:00,1028,"thanks for the report Terry.  How were ice conditions ? any vehicles out there ,we are thinking of driving out from Beaverton . 2x4 drive only so we don't plan on wandering off trail .  TB"
302973,Terry,2009-02-07 22:37:00,14456,"there were lots of cars and trucks out there  but it is still warm out so the slush might be softening up fast, but was pretty good when I was out, frozen tight"
302976,tinbanger,2009-02-07 22:40:00,1028,thanks I am hoping the colder overnight temps will help  TB
302981,misfish,2009-02-07 22:48:00,29133,"You caught a what Nice going buddy. I think you put that song to it, to get me out there. But thats months away still.LOL"
302990,brkygetr,2009-02-07 23:02:00,425,Nice video...thats crazy. You would really think with that much action a few more hookups would have been par for the course. If I saw that I would be going NUTS... come on you stupid fish TAKE IT !!!!!!!! LOL  Well done and keep those bearings safe.  Cheers  By the way...what do you do with 75 ft of cable when you get a fish on??????
302991,Joey,2009-02-07 23:04:00,9122,Way to go Terry.  Looks like you're dialed in for next weekend.  Joey
302994,Fang,2009-02-07 23:09:00,1330,Nice one TerryMust have been a different part of the lake. I was out off BBP with 6 other guys and for 6 hours 1 3lb laker was put on the ice. We got checked by MNR for licenses and they said they'd only seen a handful of fish today.  Our walk out was slushy and tough! Maybe next weekend.
302996,Terry,2009-02-07 23:13:00,14456,I had a visit from the MNR too  so far I have not had a fis get caught up in the cable but it is only a matter of time  and will make life more interesting won't it
303000,Fishing 24/7,2009-02-07 23:17:00,709,this is SO amazing!  just like iv been imagine it !  the fish comes looks at it and never takes it!  this video is accutaly going to help me throughout the day while the bite is off.... there there... just swimming pass the lure!  great job on the whitie.  whats the title of that song?
303002,misfish,2009-02-07 23:18:00,29133,  Sure glad me and the mrs booked earlly with you bud.
303008,brkygetr,2009-02-07 23:32:00,425, It will for sure...just hope its not the big one!!
303022,Terry,2009-02-08 00:01:00,14456,I can't remember the name  I will see if I can find it

303029,trapshooter,2009-02-08 00:12:00,1234,Great report Terry.  Nice looking whitey for the table as well.
303133,Shelley Cooper,2009-02-08 03:00:00,394,"WTG Terry... nice fish... did you go out to the area we were at last week?  we were out and got our limit today too... same area... we stayed till about 3... it was starting to get pretty slushy out there.. and where it was hard with little snow, was melting pretty good... I almost fell a few times... you will probably need cleats tomorrow in some area's and water proof boots for the deep slush areas...  Stay dry and safe all.."
303142,RickOnt,2009-02-08 03:14:00,669,Hi Terry  That is the BEST!!!   Is that white spot your Jig/Lure???  Upper-Right  Thanks for Taking the time to record and post  Very Neat Rick
