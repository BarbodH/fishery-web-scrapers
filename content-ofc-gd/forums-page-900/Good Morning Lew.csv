302747,lew,2009-02-07 11:23:00,12766,"Good mornin to you too Paul  I've been up for a couple hours, but this board loads soooooooooooo slow for me in the early mornings lately, I don't bother posting much anymore."
302748,Terry,2009-02-07 11:27:00,14456,yeah it's almost impossible  to open threads in the morning every morning
302757,Beans,2009-02-07 13:06:00,3339,Can't say I blame you Lew...it took me damn near 15 minutes to reply to Big Cliff's thread last Sunday morning...
302758,Guest skeeter99,2009-02-07 13:15:00,0,yeah the slowness starts around 1 am and is done at 6 am  i can never get on even at work with a t1 connection
302759,Spiel,2009-02-07 13:29:00,9065,"....I share your frustration guys, a real pain in the ass! I don't know what to tell yous 'cept try sleeping in till 7."
302780,Guest skeeter99,2009-02-07 14:34:00,0,"is the website virual  (if is other machines using resources on host)  possible backups (I know veritas netbackup sucks resources on boxes)  it also could be a bad process running away using resources also  maybe try runing a trace log for a week and see what is going on  just some possible ideas  oh another thing to the admins I noticed a security flaw or (best practice issue)  on every website i try logging in with default to see if admins turned it off, on this site they are but one issue security wise not that it really matters is allowing the username to be the same as the password which in the real world is a no no!!  anyway  just some observations"
302793,nancur373,2009-02-07 15:22:00,1211,"HACKER, HACKER!!!!!!!......lol j/k"
302795,TJQ,2009-02-07 15:23:00,7806,Were gonna have another look into it... Im rarely on the board that early.  Ill get in touch with out host.  It may be the nightly backup.. the site is so huge.  Ill see what we can do.. thanks for your patience..
302797,Jer,2009-02-07 15:32:00,1426,"I mentioned this a couple days ago. During the week, my best OFNing time is when I first get up: 6 - 7 am. Lately, on some mornings it has been unusable. If you hi-speed guys are having trouble, imagine us poor dial-up users."
302817,Guest skeeter99,2009-02-07 16:28:00,0,  no I am not a hacker I do this for a living  just trying to help out and see some things the other admins dont see  and it is these very small deficiencies that hackers exploit and do alot of mess   2 mins worth of admin work  could prevent possibly a week being down after hacker tears apart the site
302818,Guest skeeter99,2009-02-07 16:32:00,0,"  TJ  if it is the backup get them to run a incremental backup during the week (uses way less resources) and a full once a week lets say maybe saturday night or sunday night into monday morning  this is what many major clients do to increase performance on their sites on really one slow day rather than 7  and once again it depends on the backup client  and really this is just a fishing site (not to beat it down) but one weekly backup is probably all that is needed rather than nightly, you may want to bring that up with your provider and it may reduce costs of running the site greatly due to less backups  just a thought  and many are doing that now to save coin  or instead og backing up the whole site determine what is most important if lost and only backup important or major portions?  all sorts of options"
302887,OhioFisherman,2009-02-07 19:44:00,6623,"Good afternoon Lew! I am awake again! Ya also have problems with the board loading late at nite, early in the morning, don`t turn the thermostat down so low!"
302917,lew,2009-02-07 20:49:00,12766," Wouldn't know about late night problems Paul, I have enough trouble staying up till 10"
303212,camillj,2009-02-08 05:46:00,1988,Pretty quick late at night ... Lew you just have to get up earlier
303223,Guest skeeter99,2009-02-08 11:51:00,0,  it happenens after 1 am to 2am dead slow does not even load not even worth trying to get on
