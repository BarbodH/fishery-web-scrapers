302445,snag,2009-02-06 20:53:00,1932,"Landed 2 Lost 2 Multiple follows   Beaver was letting me know that he doesn't care about me   Here is the spot that produced last time. It was a mix of new ice and old chunks. Not good.   I moved on to find anything that resembled open water.  It was a pain to avoid the random ice chunks while casting/retrieving and fighting a fish.   Big annoyance is frozen braid (I know, go mono. Never!) Then my braking froze inside my reel and my spool spun in all directions. I won't mention the guides freezing..... Many nests. AAAAAAARRRRRRRGGGGGGGG   I had a heart-in-my-mouth-moment today as I clawed the thin ice. There was very little surface to stand on. I looked for the ""bubbly"" rough ice to have traction. Not very smart. Had the tools ready again.   On these icey rocks, I had to lay back and used my body as a counter balance with a fish on.  C'mon baby   Yeah baby!   Join the party  Mild Surgery   Happiness   Tomorrows outlook looks awesome!  Good luck out there!  "

302451,Jon,2009-02-06 21:03:00,209,Hey - I'm the guy you ran into just before you left your car.  Sounds like you did quite well!  I should have brought my fishing stuff rather than my camera.  I hope you have as good luck or better next time.  Jon
302456,snag,2009-02-06 21:17:00,1932, Hi Jon!  Great to meet you!  Well I guess you know my secret identity! LOL  You were very nice. Shame I will have to kill you now.    Juuuuuuuuust kidding!  Drop me a line if you want to hook up sometime.  I'll have video and scale working this time I promise! LOL  Keep your rod in your car!  
302479,Raf,2009-02-06 22:11:00,3495,ohh boi.  that looks like fun.  i think it's time to start leavin the rod in the truck too.
302489,jace,2009-02-06 22:32:00,472,"Looks like a Pflueger.  they use felt drag material.  If you like using the reel in the cold, you might want to upgrade it with wet carbon based drag.  Looks like you had a great day.  You're pretty tough to fish that day because it was obviously so cold you froze your face off.  "
302497,Leecher,2009-02-06 22:41:00,7832,Great report and pics Grant Looks like you found the gator hot spot.... Congratulations  Beautiful specimens Thanks for sharing Leechman
302509,Bly,2009-02-06 23:01:00,1556,oooh I am jealous!   Well done Snag!   Sorry to hear that your beaver friend no longer cares about you.....I hear those animals can be temperamental at times.
302517,Raf,2009-02-06 23:11:00,3495,ohh my.. i just about fell of my chair bly.  i will resist.
302536,Joey,2009-02-06 23:50:00,9122,Another great lunchtime report Snag.  Why do you keep hiding that beautiful face of your???  Take and extended lunch and don't want the boss to know?  Joey
302549,Sinker,2009-02-07 00:09:00,8692,"Dude, you need a good set of ice cleats!!!  WTG on the gators though, you do very well with them eh?  Sinker"
302564,ccmtcanada,2009-02-07 00:25:00,7971,Hey Grant...so I shouldn't post pics of your face in here??? Like this one from last year??    Oh by the way...Snag is one tough guy...he doesn't even have a limp.
302566,diggyj,2009-02-07 00:30:00,548,"Hey Grant, another awsome report, congrats, way to go.  Dirk."
302599,tdotfisherman,2009-02-07 01:22:00,317,"Another unreal report! Whatever secret spot you've got yourself there, it always seems to be paying off.. Motivated by your last post, I got out today and did some Pike hunting, but everything was either frozen solid, or the spots that weren't frozen were severely wind-blown, and the water was dirty and dingy..  Keep the posts coming.. if I can't be catching em', I'm loving the reports of people who can!"
302629,rockfish,2009-02-07 02:11:00,91,"Cool pics Snag, had the Pike itch myself but not much open water around Hamilton here.   Enjoy the great stories u tell, always an adventure.  "
302642,snag,2009-02-07 02:35:00,1932," Great, now I can spend mooooore $ Thanks Ace, I just might do that. You were right. It's a pflueger   It's a crazy lil' hole right now! Wasn't always that way?   What Raf says. Plus I'm married. Land or water, I get no respect.   Good will power!   EXACTLY!  BTW- I preferred the Manho's   I do need cleats and I do like toothy critters (re: what Bly said above)   HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA HUH? AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA MY LEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG   Anything for you, Dirk.  Do me proud!   At least you're trying. Those spots will be jumping with the warm temps next week.   Thanks Rocky,  I think Hamilton may have a banner year too. Hopefully. Keep us informed."
302653,Moosebunk,2009-02-07 02:59:00,3970,A couple more beauties man!!!  You got this down to a science now.
303097,ehg,2009-02-08 02:21:00,2666,"Another successful lunch hour there SNAG! Inspired by your posts went looking for open water on the T.O waterfront for pike and found some birds instead. Didn't catch any pike but saw some interesting birds. Got out the baitcaster and casted x-raps for first time this year   Saw some of these nearby   Also saw a duck i've never seen before, black head, white sides and constantly diving   Anyways nice going on the pike Grant! Your posts inspired me to try as well."
303658,snag,2009-02-09 02:20:00,1932," Thanks Bunk! Guppies to the brutes in yer 'hood    You are a man of friggin' action  up to 54km winds that day and you persevered  I would have split!  As you know Erik,  I was wrong.  I'm hoping we have a rain cheque so that I can get some wisdom from you.  I have something esle planned.................. "

303778,snag,2009-02-09 14:32:00,1932," I think it was around the 3rd call that I thought, ""Heyyyyyyyy, wasn't he going on vacation????""  Then I had a laugh knowing that I took up all that space and upon your return all you'll here is some maniac giddy over some fish!!   Moral of the story;  Don't leave the country when the local fishing is on!  Check yer pm's too"
303779,highdrifter,2009-02-09 14:37:00,2534, Ya sure... leave it up to moi to go somewhere hot while you bring on the local fizz!!  Those messages mang...  You were soooo giddy with pleasure!  HAHAAH!!
