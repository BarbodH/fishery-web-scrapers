303074,limeyangler,2009-02-08 01:44:00,5204,"Hi All,   Had a brutal few days at work, was sooooo tired Friday night was not gonna go fishing today, but the body clock had me up at 6:30am. I was kinda considering going, then about 8am Lew called to see where we wee going. I had to go now.....lol.  We decided to stay local, no epic journeys, so Thunder lake it was.  Got there about 1:30 am, and not much shoing. Was about an hour before any action, and even then it was a tiny little guy for me.     ITS A START        We saw fish on the screen, but the bite was slow, i hooked into 2 nice fish and lost them in the next hour, and Lew landed a lunch for one.       LUNCH FOR TWO..... MAYBE 2  <embed width=""448"" height=""361"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" wmode=""transparent"" src=""http://i263.photobucket.com/player.swf?file=http://vid263.photobucket.com/albums/ii158/vishuscirquel/lunchfor2.flv"">      The next hour was Lew spent trying to coax what we thought was a Walleye on the bottom, I managed to get a 21"" and a 24""  in that time. Credit to Lew , he managed to get the fish that was messing him around for an hour...it wasn't a walleye but a baby laker....more like a sardine....lol.       CREDIT TO LEW...HE GOT IT TO TAKE THE BAIT AFTER AN HOUR TRYING......lol  <embed width=""448"" height=""361"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" wmode=""transparent"" src=""http://i263.photobucket.com/player.swf?file=http://vid263.photobucket.com/albums/ii158/vishuscirquel/thatsnotatrouteatsasardine.flv"">      THE BIGGER OF THE 2 TROUT I GOT WHILE LEW WAS BEING KEPT BUSY BY THE SARDINE       AFTER THAT IT WENT DEAD......we tried everything. Then Lew noticed his flag was up outside, and got another little guy, went back...should have kept it as that was the last fish of the day.....we did move at around 3:30, but had no luck at the new mark, called it a day around 4:30pm....slowish day...but we got supper.      I WOULD HAVE BEEN RUNNING....LEW TOOK HIS TIME WITH WHAT WAS TO BE THE LAST FISH OF THE DAY.  <embed width=""448"" height=""361"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" wmode=""transparent"" src=""http://i263.photobucket.com/player.swf?file=http://vid263.photobucket.com/albums/ii158/vishuscirquel/Flagup.flv"">"

303117,limeyangler,2009-02-08 02:41:00,5204,   Heehee....yeah...i did not realise i'd actually vocalised that until i watched the clip when i got home....a bit mean spirited....but it made me laugh too....guess i get a litle competitive....sometimes....but Lew gives as good as he gets.
