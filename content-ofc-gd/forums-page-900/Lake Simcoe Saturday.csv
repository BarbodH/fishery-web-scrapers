303017,rhare,2009-02-07 23:53:00,387,"well I had the luxury today of riding a sled  I'm usually a walker so it was a nice change. The plan was to hit the main lake and get to some old way points for some whities. The lake had a bit of slush but the ride wasn't too bad. We got to the spot and set up and started marking fish right away. Things where looking good. We fished 90fow with a mix of spoons and tubes and the action was almost none stop, but all laker's. Hey what can you do? Catch laker's! Dan and I iced 11 and lost... way more then we should of.We started to get worried that the ride back was going to be bad with the slush so we packed up and left     The fish still pounding....  Made a call and met up with a friend off oro. He had found a nice little spot and we all shared in some more laker's.All and all a pretty good day.  Almost forgot to mention that I caught a laker today with a spreader in its mouth and dorsal fin and side. lol After a little hook and line removal ( about 25ft) I sent him back feeling a little less restricted.  tightlines  Ryan Hare             heres a pic of the guy with the spreader "

I could of switched Spots with you,  The last 2 Days For me,Lots of Whities, But hard to find a Laker,  Good job getting that Little girl going again  She was not that big to break a line,  Travelling is going to be interesting over the next few days, By the time I am off shift again, I am hoping, there will be no snow or slush and we will be back on the Bike.
