303438,diggyj,2009-02-08 21:48:00,548,Headed out this morning to put a couple of hours in on the Big Lake to try my luck at some shore Pike fishing.  Spoke to another angler that was down there and he said that the morning had been very slow. Hopefully not a sign of things to come.  Spent a total of 2 hours on the Lake and came away with nothing. Conditions were great. A slight wind but very comfortable. The ice is melting very fast and there are huge chunks drifting by as you are retrieving your lure.  I think the front that moved through yesterday as well as the rain put the fish off today. Will give her another go this week. Hoping the fishing gods will be on my side this time.  Dirk.....    
303451,tdotfisherman,2009-02-08 22:09:00,317,Keep at it.. that looks like a great spot for late winter/early spring Northern Pike..  If you catch any fish this week do us all a favour and post a report

303485,rockfish,2009-02-08 23:09:00,91,Grreat day to be out to try anyway. Hope we have some open water spots soon out this way to try for the toothy critters. Sticking to a bit of ice fishing for now while my one arm heals up from a work injury but will hopefully be better soon.
