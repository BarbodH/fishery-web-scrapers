Well that changed so I rigged up the transom transducer to a mount in hopes that it'll work for the ice (using flasher mode on the Lowrance). I pretty much need to drill 2 holes for the setup though.  I have a few questions if anyone's tried this:  1. Will the Transsom transducer work alright like this? 2. Should I be fishing right in front of the unit? (so the transducer is just in front of my lure 3. How close should I be to the transducer for seeing my jig.  So far I seem to pick it up on the flasher, but would like to know what would be optimal in this setup (or should I just get a iceducer:))"
303351,irishfield,2009-02-08 18:22:00,26272,That should work like a charm..cuts down on your finder positioning choices.. but so do all the ice machines with the little swing out transducer holder. I've been drilling three holes when using my hut. Finder in center hole.. fishing the two outer ones. Marks everything... even a 1/16th oz jig a foot off bottom in 100 FOW.  I also prefer just using the normal graph mode... flasher drives me nuts.
303355,scugpg,2009-02-08 18:32:00,1373,So are 2 outside holes are inline with the center one and it reads ok? I tried it from the side yesterday and it seemed to read better than head-on like I did it today.
303356,irishfield,2009-02-08 18:37:00,26272,Looking at your picture your puck is on a slant. It has to be flat to get proper returns. May take a bit of playing to get it just right. Shouldn't matter if it's in the hole you are fishing or in one a couple feet away.
303358,scugpg,2009-02-08 18:41:00,1373," Yup I had it flat when I was out on the ice, it must have clicked up when I was fumbling to take the pic"
303361,irishfield,2009-02-08 18:46:00,26272,What model Lowrance are you using. I had a lot of issue with my 102C. It worked fine to about 40 FOW but then was hit and miss in anything deeper. I thought it was because I was using the transom transducer so bought the ice trans and it didn't change a dam thing. Then Lloyd played with the unit and finally reset the unit to factory defaults and fine tuned from there. Works beautiful now at about 74% sensitivity. Anything more is too much. Chart speed is 100%.. ping 50%
303363,scugpg,2009-02-08 18:51:00,1373," Its a LMS-522c. I've had it in 8 to 25ft of water and it seems to be working ok. I'd get some weird blips on the flasher once in a while, and my lure would take up a few feet of depth on the flasher, so I figured something isn't quite right. I'll try those settings next time I'm"
303380,Sinker,2009-02-08 19:47:00,8692,"Use the graph mode on that unit. I have no faith in the flasher mode. The graph will pick up everything for ya. Right hand side of the screen will be real time, like a flasher, everything else is just history.  Sinker"
303411,scugpg,2009-02-08 21:01:00,1373,Sinker I'll give that a shot if we can get out again after this warmfront coming in. Thanks guys
