301199,nodie,2009-02-04 02:59:00,34,"What do you guys rely on when jigging for those golden walleyes or aggressive crappies?  I'll stick with my cardinal 100u, nothing bad to say about it except the fact that they break easily when you leave them on your fish trap seat and sit right on them when you come back Good drag in cold weather and excellent line capacity   What do you guys think?"
301216,tknohpy,2009-02-04 03:16:00,162,"I use a Shimano Sahara 500 on a 24"" MH St. Croix Legend spooled with 10# Trilene Cold Weather line."
301223,bassman,2009-02-04 03:28:00,384,I've got a couple cardinal 100u's. Good bang for the buck.
301226,steverowbotham,2009-02-04 03:46:00,1800,I run Stradic 1000's on my jiggin rods and Cardinal 100U's on my live bait rods.
301228,irishfield,2009-02-04 03:50:00,26272,I run the $18.99 combos from CTC ! Cleaned up the drag and run it on the loose side..... Clean the grease out of the gears and oil (or the grease freezes and you can't turn the handle). Haven't lost anything YET ... including the 19lb laker last winter that was a long fight in -27 weather. Now that I seem to have been bit by the ice fishing bug... I'm sure I'll upgrade my selection of gear in time.
301244,BassAsin,2009-02-04 05:13:00,806,i have been using a mitchell 300X for 4 years now on a 36 in ron and never a problem and i am REALLY hard on them!
301246,Sinker,2009-02-04 05:39:00,8692,I use a variety of reels.  Diawa laguna shimano symetre abu 5500 shimano crestfire  and a bunch of other cheapies on the back up rods. They sure take a beating.  Sinker
301286,Uncle Buck,2009-02-04 13:45:00,1000,"Quantum Icon 20's... i have 4 of them and use them year round... big enough for open water fishing, and small enough to fit on an ice rod and balance well"
301287,trapshooter,2009-02-04 13:51:00,1234,Same as Steve - Stradic 1000's.  They get used 12 months a year.
301293,capt bruce,2009-02-04 14:15:00,820,"I have 2  Quantum  E10PTi-A , they work great"
301298,joonmoon,2009-02-04 14:49:00,528,"Okuma UL 10's for me, can't beat em."
301360,yo_guy,2009-02-04 18:06:00,111,I use Quantum Snapshot SST1 for ice fishing. Can't go wrong with this $15 reel?
302390,bluesky1713,2009-02-06 17:42:00,107,"Just bought a Shakespeare Agility 6820UL  Haven't used it on the ice yet, but it's really smooth, uses an 8 bearing system and the price was right.  I've only ever known Shakespeare to make rods, but it seems like a nice reel.   http://www.shakespeare-fishing.com/product..._spinning.shtml"
302428,buckster,2009-02-06 20:02:00,530,I've got a few sahara 750's on my jigging rods........one of the best reels for the money imo...  i also run a stradic both summer and winter.
302682,waterwolf,2009-02-07 03:47:00,556," due to the fact i recently surrendered my shimano symetrie to a steroid-junky  pike , just picked up a thrifty mitchell avocet .  8 bearings just don't know how the drag will handle big she-wolves and the cold. probably a decent ice reel for the investment. mitchell's are bullet-proof , might be a great ice reel ,,eh matt?"
302901,Joeytier,2009-02-07 20:06:00,3990,Has anyone used the new HT ice fishing reels with the spool that points towards to first guide?  They seem really nice.
303006,Fishing 24/7,2009-02-07 23:29:00,709,i found a OLD reel in my sisters basement........shimano1000 mint condition...  add it on a 10 $ STIFF C-TIRE rod.  #1 in thew world!
303284,limeyangler,2009-02-08 15:31:00,5204,"I dont fish crappies, but i have cappy combo reels on all my rods, lol, just switch 'em over in the summer.  I have always liked Shimano...i also like rear drag systems, gives you the opportunity to quickly give slack, also perfect for setting a deadstick presentation for Lakers with drag set to freespool.   I've had my eye on thess ones ( the small 1500 series) but they are only available in Europe.  love these reels"
303303,croixed,2009-02-08 16:16:00,14,I have a variety of reels I use:  1.  Daiwa Laguna's 2.  Daiwa Crossfire's 3.  Shimano Sedona's 4.  Shimano Sahara's 5.  Abu 100's  All have held up quite fine in the cold weather
