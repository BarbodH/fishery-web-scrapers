302541,Bernie,2009-02-06 23:58:00,3190,Well I hooked the trailer up but it wuz draggin' just a little at the front. The ball on the bumper wuz the wrong size too. So I had to adapt a taller bracket up.    It sagged out the tailgate a little so jammed in a 4x4 . By golly that helped a lot.    So now all I gotta do is load up the fishin' pole and a few jigs and away we goes.    You all got a place I can plug the tv in thar GCD?
