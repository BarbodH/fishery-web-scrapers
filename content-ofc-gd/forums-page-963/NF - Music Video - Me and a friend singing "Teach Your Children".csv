250282,solopaddler,2008-09-16 20:58:00,8605,That was awesome buddy!  How about switching gears a little. Metallica perhaps?
250337,Paulus,2008-09-16 23:27:00,522,"...oooo Metallica would be kewl. Ring me up if you need rhythm guitar  (p.s. love the new Metallica album & would love to hear your thoughts on that one)  That was an excellent rendition, and I've listened to it a couple of times... so far  Solo says to switch gears... hmmm.... why not try ""Picture"" by Kid Rock/Sheryl Crow? Or really switch gears and try ""Baby it's cold outside"" ?  Either way, I look forward to your next masterpiece!  p.-"
250343,Radnine,2008-09-16 23:40:00,1538,Does Hazel fish as well? What a great job and an amazing talent (both of you). Thanks for sharing that. Jim
250344,ccmtcanada,2008-09-16 23:44:00,7971,"Thanks again everyone!  We may get ambitious and try Leader of the Band by Dan Fogelberg....it's tough, but we'll see....."
250445,ccmtcanada,2008-09-17 12:24:00,7971," LOL...now that's funny....  She is reading this thread, and she sent me this for a response...  ""I suppose if you consider sitting by the lake on a lawnchair surfing on a blackberry ""fishing""....then I guess I do!!!!!!""  When I show her pictures of fish that bly and I catch, her stomach turns at the sight.  Explaining the fish cleaning process to her may result in her running to the bathroom.  She's ok in our books though cause she watches our youngest when we go to Lakair...."
250457,Beans,2008-09-17 12:59:00,3339,"Great job on that tune...  Maribeth stood here to listen...she thought I was playing a ""Peter, Paul and Mary"" tune at first..."
250465,Fishitrist,2008-09-17 13:14:00,6,"Very nicely done, thanks"
250468,snag,2008-09-17 13:33:00,1932,Hazels got a great voice.  That song sounds awesome with a female harmony too.  I'd like to hear you do a Bruce Cockburn tune.
250522,corvette1,2008-09-17 16:34:00,1765,nice job cliff that was awesome
250543,Tarzan's Jane,2008-09-17 17:44:00,1183,"I was singing right along....you two sound great together. I have a request as well, only I don't recall the name of the tune nor the artist...I guess there would be no sense humming it eh.  hehe"
250546,ccmtcanada,2008-09-17 17:57:00,7971, Thanks!  We will consider all requests...we just need a little bit more info
250746,fishinggeek,2008-09-18 04:04:00,325,"Music, marketing, economics, super dad, and fishing?  Does it ever end?  Great song!  What about a Dylan cover next?"
251256,misfish,2008-09-19 20:30:00,29133,Thats was awesome Cliff. I would have no problem cutting a song or two with ya. Do ya know any country.LOL
249663,ccmtcanada,2008-09-15 01:03:00,7971,"Sorry bout the non fishing post, but I wanted to share this tune.   This is a song that my friend (Hazel) and I worked on a little for that camping trip that Bly and I went on this past summer.  Singing around the fire is a tradition and this was the new song for the year.  It's written by Graham Nash (performed by Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young)...a classic song called Teach Your Children.  The version in this video consists of one guitar and two voices...although I do have a version that has a bass line and a second harmony line added.  Anyhow, here it is...hope you enjoy!  <object width=""425"" height=""344""><param name=""movie"" value=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l7ihoFFHiE&hl=en&fs=1""></param><param'>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l7ihoFFHiE&hl=en&fs=1""></param><param name=""allowFullScreen"" value=""true""></param><embed src=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l7ihoFFHiE&hl=en&fs=1"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" allowfullscreen=""true"" width=""425"" height=""344""></embed></object>"
249666,Daplumma,2008-09-15 01:15:00,1961,Great job bud.One of my favorite tunes. Joe
249668,Dano,2008-09-15 01:19:00,719,"Good stuff Cliff & Hazel, I've always been fond of that song. Cliff, the way you and Hazel sing together reminds me of the duo consisting  of Eugene Levy and Cathy O'hara as Mitch and Mickey in the fine film A Mighty Wind. This is by no means meant as an insult, I think they sing just fine together, thanks for sharing."

249670,OhioFisherman,2008-09-15 01:22:00,6623,"Nothing to be sorry about there, nice job on an old favorite."
249671,tibbs,2008-09-15 01:22:00,650,Sound great!
249673,hammercarp,2008-09-15 01:24:00,964,A great song and you did it very well. Thank you. I did enjoy it.
249674,danc,2008-09-15 01:25:00,4677,"Cliff, Cliff, Cliff.... I'm lost for words here Buddy. That was so awesome. I'll probably watch that video at least 100 times before I tire of it. You are an amazing man. You dedicate yourself and excel at whatever you do. You are a role model. Some day I'd like to shake your hand."
249681,Dondorfish,2008-09-15 01:33:00,1000,  Never cease to amaze me! Awsome job Cliff!   Don
249683,Bernie,2008-09-15 01:36:00,3190,"Years ago when that tune came out new(yes-before it was a classic) it seemed like a ho-hum tune. Guess headbanging stuff was more cool at the time  . Now CSN&Y are one of my favorites. What talent they were/are. You and Hazel did a wonderful rendition. It took over 20 minutes to download here on dialup, glad I did. Thank you."
249687,ChrisK,2008-09-15 01:40:00,2772,"Cliff,that is a classic,well done. You'll have to let Hazel know we all really liked her singing...  Thanx"
249692,douG,2008-09-15 01:51:00,2693,"Let me know when you might use a third voice there Cliff.  Put this one on the playlist for the next G2G.  A very fine blend, great tuning from you and Hazel.  Fine job."
249700,ccmtcanada,2008-09-15 02:06:00,7971,Thanks everyone for the comments!  It was a really great song to learn and play.....   No insults there Dano....those two surprised me BIG time when I saw that film!   Likewise Dan...would be great to meet you one day!  I feel the same way about the photos that you take....simply amazing talent.    Wow....20 minutes for a 3 minute song...LOL.  Thanks for the compliment and for waiting it out Bernie!!!  On the G2G playlist for sure!  Thanks.
249701,ccmtcanada,2008-09-15 02:07:00,7971, Thanks....will let her know!
249716,holdfast,2008-09-15 03:08:00,1813,"Wow that was awesome Cliff, Hazel has the perfect voice for that song. Rock on"
249720,jwl,2008-09-15 03:37:00,1056,"that's pretty cool, nothing like sitting around the camp fire jammin out a few ole classics..also a fine tradition at my trailer, or anyother outdoor event that happens and a few of us bring along somehting to beat a tune out on...thanks for sharing"
249859,ccmtcanada,2008-09-15 16:43:00,7971,Thanks again guys....I've sent Hazel the link to this thread so she can read the responses.  We are thinking of our next duet....any suggestions out there???

249916,MCTFisher9120,2008-09-15 18:57:00,3761,I don't know of the song but it is clear you and your friend can sing it. Nice job!
250006,MuskyBill,2008-09-16 00:38:00,311,"Wow, that was the highlight of my day...  Thanks for taking the time to learn/practice/record/upload & post it here, Cliff!!"
250013,PERCHER,2008-09-16 00:59:00,787,Cliff I dont know what to say but
250029,oxcowboy,2008-09-16 01:59:00,544,"cliff,  YOU ARE THE MAN!!!! awesome job on a great song.  your talent in everything you do amazes me.  jason"
250050,holdfast,2008-09-16 02:45:00,1813," Do you guys think you can cut a Matt Mays song, Like tall trees.  Did a utube and found out he was from Nova Scotia.   Sounded like from the south states when I first heard him.  If not a Pink floyd tribute to Richard Wright.  Thats all.  no pressure on Hazel."
250107,bushart,2008-09-16 09:59:00,2628,"Terrific job--I admire those that have musical ability--great guitar work  Now I'm a Neil fan----he did a duet with Emmy Lou Harris --""Wrecking Ball""---No expert but it may play into that style you guys got going there.  Bushart"
