248895,Jer,2008-09-12 14:37:00,1426,"  I'm assuming they sell gas in Buffalo by the US gallon (3.79L), not Imp. gallon (4.5L). Take into account the exchange and he was about bang on."
248896,fishnsled,2008-09-12 14:37:00,3520,"I'm off on vacation next week.  Needed boat gas, truck gas and filled a couple of   cans for the boat next week.  Total spent - $170.  The bonus - they were out of regular so they were giving the supreme for the cost of regular."
248904,jwl,2008-09-12 14:48:00,1056," I hear ya, I have a trip planned with a few guys next weekend...need to fill my van both ways,will be towing a buddies boat , and when there,I have 2 boats there that will need gas,the bigger boat costs about 20 bucks a day if travelling around, fortunately already have almost a tank there, who ever uses my 14 fter is lucky cuz I already have a full tank for that and it's good for a couple days. Is the rising price of gas going to stop us??/well no, I figure if I gotta worry about an extra 20 bucks for the trip in boat gas that I got way worse problems than trying to go on a fishin mission..the good part, we are carpooling in my van..but we will be using 3 boats..think about it, it will probably cost more money for gas in total than it will for everyone's food and drink the whole time...well depends on how the beer is flowing, but you get the point.  For the most part this summer has probably cost my family and average of about 25-30 bucks a trip to go to camp...probably an average of 100 bucks more a month to enjoy our summer fun."
248949,Billy Bob,2008-09-12 17:05:00,5865,Our gas in the Buffalo area is about $3.80 per gallon. It has gone down each and every week since the 4th of July. Here is a Buffalo Gas Station Site where you can find gas even cheaper. http://www.buffalogasprices.com/
248960,Wild,2008-09-12 17:42:00,704,It might come to the point that heading across the border will soon be worthwhile unless the canuckbuck drops again. The problem right now though is that if the hurricane wipes out any texas tea refineries look for gas prices to go higher.
248966,wgk36,2008-09-12 17:54:00,69,Tanked up here in Montreal yesterday at $1.279/L.  It's at $1.369 today.  I always try to fill up mid week.  They seem to jack the price before weedends and holidays.
249005,Tarzan's Jane,2008-09-12 20:30:00,1183,"For the first time in a very long time, diesel is cheaper than gas...I filled up at 122.7 (thank you God) and gas (unleaded) was listed at 127.9"
249032,Canuck2fan,2008-09-12 22:06:00,1444,OH OH here we go again. They shut down a major pipeline today so expect another increase according the McTeague but he doesn't know the amount.... He said on Duffy Live that it shouldn't be as big as last nights but it will still be significant.
249040,Photoz,2008-09-12 22:36:00,792,
249044,Wild,2008-09-12 22:44:00,704,Weekend prices are now posted plus look at the price for diesel in Montreal $1333.5 per liter!
249060,Billy Bob,2008-09-12 23:29:00,5865,"I hate to say it, but they are STICKING IT to you guys. Our prices as of 7pm are still holding at $3.80 per US gallon."
249103,Wild,2008-09-13 01:07:00,704,No kidding Billy Bob we know it as well. perhaps there will be a class action lawsuit in the works so everyone get receipts. Prices should be $1.00 per liter regular.
249131,oncogene,2008-09-13 05:14:00,154,"Don't the gas companies LOVE hurricanes or what. Just when the oil price is going down, here comes another hurricane to give them all the excuse they need to  jack up the price.... ""OMG hurricane, we'r scared and we'r gona increase the gas price so the pile of cash can give us more comfort.""    Becoz it's cheaper for the gas companies to pay-off the politicians to have their mouth shut, then to actually lower the price (or stop increasing the price)."
249132,danc,2008-09-13 05:18:00,4677,Filled up both tanks today for 1.10/liter.
249140,brickNblock,2008-09-13 10:44:00,598,We has gas out here Friday morning anywhere from 119.6 - 121.8 ...and on the Rez where I filled up it was 117.8. By late Friday most places were 136.8. Thats an average close to..Hmmmm????   about $0.17/ltr All because Ike may or may not hit shore.
249150,pigeonfisher,2008-09-13 13:45:00,696,Here in southern PA we are paying $3.39 per USG
249153,wuchikubo,2008-09-13 14:08:00,1114,"Drove by the pumps, it went from 135.2 to 138.2 since yesterday."
249158,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-09-13 14:53:00,0,"Somebody has to pay for the losses the American banks(which are actually European banks) have taken. And seeing that Canada's economy is stronger, looks like we will be carrying the debt.  The PC government is pro big industry(FOREIGN) and another lap dog for the elites. They have been preparing our country to be taken over by foreign investors.....  What a great system the super wealthy have. Invest OUR money. Make all kinds of money and their money is untouched and grows. And when they take a loss with OUR money and their gravy train starts to slow down? They make more money from the Federal reserve, which increases the money supply,lowers the currency value and increases inflation. Which means high prices.  More or less we work and pay for over priced goods to maintain the wealth of the super rich."
249321,charlied,2008-09-14 03:30:00,584,I was in New Jersey and New York City and they said it went up like .60 cents a gallon.  I guess it went up to $4.80 a gallon but in New York City it was still $3.89.  Crazy how 2 places so close can have such huge differences.
249323,hammercarp,2008-09-14 03:38:00,964,A guy from North Carolina on another fishing forum blames it all on us north americans for overbuying and hoarding gas!
250979,Wild,2008-09-18 21:36:00,704,Regular gas should drop to around $1.13 for Friday Sept19 so wait until after midnight if you can to fill up.
250985,JohnF,2008-09-18 21:44:00,3494," Well, I know that some of my southern US friends save up a bit of extra gas to run their gennies etc in the event of one of their hurricanes. I suppose if enuf folks squirrel away 100 gallons of fuel each, that might make a dent in the supply.  JF"
251056,cpguy29,2008-09-19 01:02:00,148," I think there might be some truth to that. Just take a drive in 401 rush hour traffic and you'll see how selfish Canadians are. 90+ percent of cars have one person driving in it. Why aren't more people carpooling? Because of individualism...everyone thinks of themselves, wants to be in there own little space, and dosn't want to put up with a little inconvience to save gas and money. Gas prices are based on supply and demand, less cars on the road equals less traffic, less demand for gas and lower prices. I have been carpooling for 3 years now. Every time I suggest carpooling to commuters complaining about gas prices I get a funny look from them. People need to be more forward thinking instead of stuck in their old ways."
251390,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-09-20 16:15:00,0," There is some truth to that, but not on the civilian level. After 9/11, The American military started increasing its oil reserves in case of war in the middle east and who has to pay the bill? The consumer. They say America has at least 4 years of oil supply should they go to war with Iran and oil supplies are disrupted.  China has also been building up their reserves, since Iran is a major supplier of oil to China.  So there is a good chance another world war is unfolding......Its all about Imperialism. Submit to the super powers or be destroyed.  Obviously there are other factors. All of which are a result of greed."
251480,cpguy29,2008-09-21 02:29:00,148,  Don't forget about Chavez. The corperate elite are gonna take a big hit now that he's taking control of the oil in his country. Definatley ruffled some feathers. Interesting how Russia is doing navel exercises off the coast of Venezuala. We'll see who's first Chavez or Iran. Perhaps Iran is too much of a threat to Israel for the US to be stiring things up over there. Something definately brewing.
248688,Wild,2008-09-11 22:22:00,704,"Gas is going up from 123.7 cents to 136.6 cents by Friday morning, according to Liberal MP Dan McTeague.  Dan has predicted the pump prices successfully  for quite some time so I consider the above warning valid.  Fill up today while you can.  http://www.mcteague.ca/WebPages/gas_price_today.htm"

248696,timmeh,2008-09-11 22:48:00,609,just checked again and this is true. But it's not related to the hurricane and oil prices dropped today. It's due to mark up by refineries - 20.9 cents above market value.
248701,Greencoachdog,2008-09-11 22:52:00,8163,  ... and that would be because I'm traveling to your lovely country next week!

248726,danc,2008-09-12 00:04:00,4677, We've been paying 136.6+ for a few months now already. 123.7 sounds like you've been stealing it to me. Must be nice. Can't wait for tomorrow's prices.
248729,Tarzan's Jane,2008-09-12 00:14:00,1183,Diesel went down 4 cents today in my neck of the woods...now sitting at 122.9   I'm just going to believe that it will stay like that until I can fill up.

248797,holdfast,2008-09-12 03:40:00,1813,"The day before Labour Day weeknd Gas here Spiked 9 cents to 139.9.  Of Course the Hurricane was on its way to New Orleans.  Well oil was being reduced daily and now its near $100.  But our Gas went down 2 Cents to 137.9.  This should be the Campaign issue but it ain't, something has to be done to control this fraud."
248798,timmeh,2008-09-12 04:12:00,609,You'd really think this should be a campaign issue. The first politician to put forth a plan to control this would be very popular right now. This screw job on the public is absolutely ridiculous.

On Wednesday the news report said that pump prices had dropped and gas prices were to go down to about $1.10 per litre in a couple of weeks....I see the news last night and they now say that prices are going up!!! This the very day after they say it's going to drop further!! What a load of bullcrap!!  BTW, I made it to the Pioneer before the hike and paid $1.21/L. After a 20 minute wait in the line up."

Gas cost for the days fishing for truck and boat, $131.00.   We're retired, and it makes you think. How long is it going to be before fishing will be a memory. Every time the gas goes up there's a new excuse. Lies Lies Lies. Example: price of aluminum is going up so I am selling my boat for more than what I paid. If I can find a buyer. You see all the boats out there for sale."
248879,Fish Farmer,2008-09-12 14:07:00,2234,Burt $ 1.10 is about $5.00 a Gallon. I didn't want to scare you bud.
