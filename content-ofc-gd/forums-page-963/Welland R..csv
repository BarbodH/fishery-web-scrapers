The great thing about rivers like the Welland, you never know what's gonna bite. The drill:  drift trolling with the wind. Gear: a 5' lite rod and 10lb braid. Weapon: Ugliboys harness.  The drift covered a 1/2 mile section of water. A few perch and rockbass interspersed with some of the following:      and my guest for breakfast  We would have stayed into the evening, but we could already feel our ears burning.   Would not want to upset our lovely wives, now would we?"

251471,bigugli,2008-09-21 01:29:00,6138,"On a beautiful day like today, you had better expect me to be going stir crazy otherwise I must have died. No chance on me getting grounded. I'm outright gnarly when I'm stuck at home. Besides, Mr Bill was there to make sure I didn't get into any trouble like falling out of the boat or whacking myself on the console again   As long as I have a chaperone all is good. As for the walter. The stocking program is paying real dividends.  I've caught fish in 4 year classes this year  with sizes from 11"" to 20"".  The pike fishery will quickly improve, as well, with the changes in the regs."
