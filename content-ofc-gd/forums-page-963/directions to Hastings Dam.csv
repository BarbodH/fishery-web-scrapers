251313,Pinch,2008-09-20 00:51:00,231,hwy 401 to cty rd 45 (2nd cobourg exit) go north for about 50km till you get to the bridge.
251314,commie,2008-09-20 00:52:00,29,i tried typing in 'hasting dam ontario'...in google map and no returns...  what should I type in?  if the shore fishing still good there?
251319,hammercarp,2008-09-20 01:13:00,964,You don't need to google anything. 401 east then north on 45 takes you right to it.
