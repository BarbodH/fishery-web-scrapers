250869,ehg,2008-09-18 15:57:00,2666,"Someone recently gave me a printer/photocopy/fax thing you plug in the computer. Not really into these technologies but i plugged it in and tried it out. It is brand new and it worked so i scanned some photos of fish from the mid 1990's. Thought i'd post them here to try the stuff further.  Tried the photobucket editor and pressed 'beautify' and it blurred my face. So i guess it did 'beautify'. A carp i caught on a shad rap in the winter.   A nice brown from around same time   Nice musky my buddy caught one fall day   Probably the cleanest, prettiest musky I ever caught.   So it all works. Put the pics of ex-wife on different website. lol... just joking  Enjoy, ehg"
250873,bucktail,2008-09-18 16:06:00,1857,Beautiful brown!

250878,BillM,2008-09-18 16:33:00,17367,I hope we add to those memorable pics this weekend!  That brown is a fatty!
250890,Mr. Follow,2008-09-18 17:07:00,34,Nice pics.
250900,Wild,2008-09-18 17:30:00,704,All nice fish EHG!
250910,blaque,2008-09-18 17:40:00,2419, That is pretty funny  So looks like you have the vessel in the water from your avatar tony........tis a beautiful thing
250911,snag,2008-09-18 17:40:00,1932,Great shots!  Kids today have no idea how hard it was to get a good pic.  You would never know if the pic was even good until AFTER you developed the film!
251054,Tarzan's Jane,2008-09-19 01:00:00,1183,  Ditto
251064,PatrickGG,2008-09-19 01:29:00,562,"That Brown is one Pig, Nice fish."
251085,ehg,2008-09-19 02:37:00,2666,"Not sure the brookies will be as big but we should do alright.  Those pics were taken on a $20 camera from back in the day. So was just hoping pic would turn out, would find out a little while later not instantly like these days."
251151,blaque,2008-09-19 13:56:00,2419," i remember those days, press click, and hope for the best......REALLY worrysome if you were on a trip of a lifetime, just wondering if all your beautiful pics were gonna be in focus, framed right, etc etc etc........drop it off at the developer and go home with your fingers crossed! I remember going to pick them up and hearing, you only got 21 pics out of your 24 exposure roll of film"
251203,jedimaster,2008-09-19 16:51:00,3472,"Yah I remember those days, but I don't ever remember having such a hard time getting clear shots with my old SLR Minolta as I do with my new digital automatic camera. takes me a dozen clicks before I get on prefectly in focus. Sometimes I get lucky but other times, I figure bah I got 4 gigs of space I'll just take 50 pictures of this 2 pound bass.  That silvery looking mud sucker sure is fat.  Nice Skii's btw."
251206,Reef Runner,2008-09-19 16:58:00,980,"very nice fish ehg!  that is one serious brown, thanks for sharing it!"
251323,majorlifts,2008-09-20 01:40:00,171,"OMG!! That was some good fishin, and some great weather we had, all the conditions were perfect. We caught those muskies the same day. By the way I must have laughed for at least 20 min on the beautify feature."
