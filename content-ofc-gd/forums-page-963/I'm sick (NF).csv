250760,Tarzan's Jane,2008-09-18 08:13:00,1183,"Is it ""feed a fever and starve a cold""   or ""starve a cold and feed a fever"".  I have a wicked sore throat and fever.  Was home yesterday, going to work today but will no doubt leave early."
250765,Spiel,2008-09-18 10:00:00,9065," ....Isn't that the same thing?  Starve a fever, hope you feel better soon. Sore throats and flus have already been through my house."
250767,fatherof3,2008-09-18 10:23:00,1769,"was just at the walk-in yesterday for sore throat,fever and sinus congestion.turns out I have a sinus infection,bronchitis and possible strept throat.I was ordered off work for a couple days and given antibiotics. I would get it looked at if I were you as it seems to be going around.hope you feel better."
250783,Randy,2008-09-18 11:27:00,115,"I think its feed a cold and starve a fever. The thinking being that fevers tend to also involve nausea. And if you eat when you are nauseated, you'll likely throw up."
250784,ccmtcanada,2008-09-18 11:29:00,7971, Ordered off work?  I think your recovery would speed up in fresh air....perhaps sitting in a boat  Hope you BOTH are feeling better soon!
250789,BITEME,2008-09-18 11:58:00,1969,Always eat no matter what ......FEED THE FURNACE!!!!!!
250795,Headhunter,2008-09-18 12:32:00,5703,"COLD FX!!!!!!!!! It works for some, it doesn't work for others! For me, it is the only thing I take and it works! Expensive, but as you're wallowing in your own personal misery, $30.00 doesn't seem like a lot of money to pay... does it!? HH"
250856,Ramble,2008-09-18 15:22:00,713,Starve a fever...feed a cold.  Lots of fluid and bed rest. Keep and eye ont eh back of your throat. If its strep you will get white blotches that look like hell early on. Then it goes red and you stay sick. you have to goto the doctor for strep or get into more trouble later on.  Go to the drug store and get some vit D and C. Both are instumental for the immune system. If you go ill tell you how much to take.  -Dr. R-
250880,Tarzan's Jane,2008-09-18 16:43:00,1183," hahaha....why yes it is the same thing...it was early and I was hurting.  I was basically told to go home..  Anyway...I am hungry, so I'm eating...then a little doh doh.  Thanks everyone...hope no one else gets this...especially the Lakair crew!!"

250884,Tarzan's Jane,2008-09-18 16:55:00,1183,  *hic...me having RUM...*hic Amazing how better I feel already ...
250885,Governator,2008-09-18 16:56:00,879,Nothing is worse than a sore throat except perhaps backpain.  Lay off the maple leaf deli
250918,mattmacewan,2008-09-18 18:14:00,18,"To answer your question it's actually neither.  Feed a cold & starve a fever is the old wives tale.  Like many others, this one has some physiologic basis with a tiny little bit of evidence showing this may have somebenefit wrt to different immune modulator stimulants.  But there are still questions if it actually makes you feel better (symptom relief).  Either way, your history is too small to say one way or the other.    Could be a simple cold but could also be something that needs MD tx like strep or mono.  Great thing about Canada is good fishin & free doctorin.  Even if you have to wait a little for both."
250949,Canuck2fan,2008-09-18 19:54:00,1444,"If your sore throat persists for more than 5 or 6 days you really should go see if it is strep or not. The infection if you have it can spread to other areas after your throat feels better and do some real damage.... The only thing that will get rid of strep safely is a full course of anitbiotics.  I find the hardest thing about having a sore throat is getting to sleep. Here is an old home rememdy that works for everyone who is brave enough to try it. Take a large glass of coke heat it in the mircowave, until it is really hot (it will probably boil though). Pop two tylenol cold and flu sip the warm coke and go to bed for 10 HOURS you will sleep like a baby and wake up able to handle the day....  (worse case senario is that you start liking warmed up coke LOL.)"
250980,camillj,2008-09-18 21:36:00,1988,Sore throat ... instant remedy .... and move the cold/flu to its next stage (without passing go) ... is to gargle with a half glass of warm water with 4 tablespoons of salt in it ... DONT SWALLOW ! ... spit it out .. sore throat which otherwise drags on ... goes bye-bye in a few minutes .... and then the nasty next stage (whatever that is) comes but it sure beats messing around for a couple of days with lozenges etc ... NEVER fails .... oh and I concur with the Neocitran/rye .... but I add a spoon of honey and tuck right into bed  ....then get up early and go fishin ... nothin cures a cold like a day on the water
250999,Moosebunk,2008-09-18 22:34:00,3970,"Trusted by good doctors and better nurses...  A very commonly used book http://www.mumshealth.com/ by GP's, NP's and RNEC's lists criteria to aptly score viral versus bacterial infections of the throat.  Streptococcal Score Validated in Adults and Children  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Symptoms Points  Fever (subjective or measured in office 38C +)                     1 Absence of cough                                                               1 Tender anterior cervical adenopathy                                     1 Tonsillar swelling or exudates                                              1  Age Younger than 15 years                                                    +1 15 to 45 years                                                                  0 Older than 45 years                                                         -1    SCORING:  0 or -1 points: streptococcal infection ruled out (2 percent) 1 to 3 points: order rapid test (throat swab) and treat accordingly to result 4 to 5 points: probable streptococcal infection (52 percent positive for strep on swab), consider empiric antibiotics.   Couple other points of interest.  If you have a cold, cough and congestion, your throat likely requires no antibiotic.  If you have the ""tickle"" that cause that nagging cough and resultants sore throat, your infected throat very likely requires no antibiotic.  Acute redness (like a stop sign) of the oropharynx and/or tonsils, especially with localized edema in that area, no cold symptoms, a feeling of death warmed over and a score of 4+ and you very well could have Strep throat."
