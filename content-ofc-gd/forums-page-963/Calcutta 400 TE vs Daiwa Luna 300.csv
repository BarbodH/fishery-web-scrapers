250992,brickNblock,2008-09-18 22:01:00,598,"Sorry I cant comment on the Luna300 but the Calcutta TE is one of my confidence reels, ......and Im a lefty so its 401. On the other hand,,Okuma has a nice reel similar to the Calcutta for about 1/3-1/2 the price and also one of my confidence reels.  Its the Okuma Induron 301   ($150) of pure magic. I do0nt know much about Luna as I had said but Shimano as well Okuma have better then great waranties.  my $0.02"

251119,jediangler,2008-09-19 11:39:00,1923,That Pluton costs $100 more than I paid for my kayak! Ouch.
251236,mattyk,2008-09-19 19:01:00,2110,Thanks for the feedback.
251299,Wild,2008-09-19 23:53:00,704,By the way there is a review on Daiwa models as well. I am kind of leaning towards the Shimano myself but let's see what new product improvements come out for 2009 http://www.tackletour.com/reviewdaiwaluna.html
251300,Pigeontroller,2008-09-19 23:58:00,2793,"Both are 2 of the best round baitcasters on the market. You will be happy with either, though the TE will be harder on your bank account by about $120!"
251304,mattyk,2008-09-20 00:18:00,2110,i went with the TE. Cant wait to give it a try.
251336,tnt,2008-09-20 02:24:00,63,I use a TE 401 and love it.  Bet you will too!
251340,danbo,2008-09-20 03:11:00,2646,It's the only Shimano I ever wanted! Lol..good buy.
