251238,pikeie,2008-09-19 19:23:00,380,i got to the rapids around 9 oclock to day.  i got to a nice hole and started castin and swingin my flys. second cast i see a pick up and a quickly get a fish on. now i havnt been fishing this river long and up untill today ive only caught a handful of pinks on the fly. but thi fish was pullin hard infact i had to chase the fish through a set of rapids so i wouldnt lose him. no one there had ever seen a pink fight like this every one was susprised when i finally landed it that it was a pink. anyways it was my new pb at 23 inches and way over 5 lbs. again i really have to find some type of camera. in the end today  went 10 for 12 with another two that some how got the fly in the hump lol. so far this has been my greatest day in the rapids
