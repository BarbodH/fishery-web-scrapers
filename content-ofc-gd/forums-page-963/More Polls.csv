250959,jwl,2008-09-18 20:19:00,1056,"didn't pick anything on the poll.....but I fish for pretty much anything that swims 12 months a year..for me there really isn't a beginning and end to fishing season...it's 12 months a year long, always something is in season to fish for, my 2008 season started January 2nd when I renewed my liscence"
250966,wolfville,2008-09-18 20:52:00,396,Hmm.....are canned corn and boilies artificial or live baits?
251011,gdelongchamp,2008-09-18 23:02:00,199,walleye
251013,Billy Bob,2008-09-18 23:06:00,5865,I fish for walleye but catch mostly galvanized pike
251389,hammercarp,2008-09-20 16:09:00,964, I asked myself the same question. I figure it's live since they are not artificial.
251399,steelheader42,2008-09-20 17:04:00,44,You forgot bluegills.....lol
251451,Rich,2008-09-21 00:02:00,3927,Mighty creek chubs!
251457,bigugli,2008-09-21 00:19:00,6138,You missed crappie and sunfish.
251477,Moosebunk,2008-09-21 02:08:00,3970,Favorites are pike and specks.  Followed very closely by anything else that swims.  For the fishing up here I use a fair bit of live/dead bait.  In dirty waters it often helps.  I like spring and fall fishing best.
251579,Dabluz,2008-09-21 18:54:00,701,I mostly fish for speckled trout and walleye.  They were not in the poll.
