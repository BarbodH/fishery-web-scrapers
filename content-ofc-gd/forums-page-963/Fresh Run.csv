Smashing eggs like Steelhead.    The Release, Like a torpedo after a little revival.    Alot of these little guys around in the 6-10"" range, nice to see for the future,....  "

251474,StoneFly,2008-09-21 01:38:00,574,"This run was a fresh one and the I beleive the first this area has seen this year for nooks as i have scouted it, as well as evidenced by the amount of rainbow smolts hittin flys and roe every second drift,...lol,...what i noticed different about this year in september is the lack of chub, not a single one today, but about 25 x 6-8"" rainbow smolts in 1.5 hrs. (and 2/3 on the nooks all clean and not a single snag and not a soul in site)...  Anyone have any idea why a fresh run of salmon at this time of year would also see so many rainbow smolts (which is great)  ... and no chub ?  In the past in this locale it was usually 1 for 1 for bow smolts and chubs when the salmon first arrive?  I mean, no chubs is great,..but it is better or worse for the river ?"
251500,MJL,2008-09-21 07:32:00,2427,Great catch!  Also got into the small rainbows on another trib this week (Lake O) but did see a few small minnow/shiner type of fish around with them.
251526,kemper,2008-09-21 13:41:00,2232,"I found last week that I was getting into a lot of smaller rainbow smolts like that and it was getting to the point of irritating. Switched up to a pink worm in the faster water and started hitting 15""-20"" like no tomorrow. Not only was it great fun but it also seemed like there was a REALLY healthy number of bows in the river"
