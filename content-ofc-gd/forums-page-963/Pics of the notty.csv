Moved on, took some more pics from a place I fish for steelhead in the spring.  Where my car is, there's usually about half a foot of water, no fall fishing here... yet anyways. Stopped in thornbury, water looked a lot better than the notty but I took a smoke break for about half an hour and heard/saw nothing. although there were two people with waders in the outflow.  Good smoke break it was.  *edit* it was north of 26, south of wasaga beach. If it's looked better somewhere else, pm me or post here.  "
