250936,legacey,2008-09-18 19:12:00,127,"Hey Sugarpacket.  When I was doing this, I had a thought;  This poll could have included ""do you have a local bait and tackle store?""  Kingston does not, Belleville is the closest and for some reason, they don't seem to last here.  Cheers"
250940,Governator,2008-09-18 19:34:00,879,If I'm going to a new lake or area then I use a local tackle shop as they know what works best on their lake.  Otherwise if Crappy Tire or Walmart has what I'm looking for then no need to drive 40min to bass pro shop.   EDIT: Being in marketing I think promoting the fact that you know the lake better than others would convince some to come in to the shop where they might not have otherwise.
250953,Canuck2fan,2008-09-18 20:04:00,1444,I think everyone here is guilty of buying from all and any sources LOL.
250962,jwl,2008-09-18 20:24:00,1056,"again didn't check anything off in the poll.  for me I guess it depends on what I am looking for,where I happen to buy it.  I can say that I pretty much buy somehting before everytime I go fishin, and that's probably 200 plus days a year"
251050,bassjnkie,2008-09-19 00:57:00,1101,"I don't buy from small shops as much as I use to. I buy from Bass pro and Cabelas, once in a while LeBaron. I mainly purchase online every day or every second day, the online sotres prices can't be beat, even with shipping. For my carp items it's all online mainly ebay.co.uk or Specialist tackle.  Hope this helps, Daniel"
251358,Billy Bob,2008-09-20 11:47:00,5865,My local tackle store went into Paint Ball crap and over the years completely did away with hunting/fishing equipment.  So he abandoned me      But that's OK because Cabela's is now my BEST friend
251363,silveradosheriff,2008-09-20 12:48:00,1025,"Cabellas and my local store fit the bill for me, with some LeB sprinkled in there...."
251453,Rich,2008-09-21 00:05:00,3927,"CTC has sucked my money away lately because I don't have any local shops. The one ""local"" shop is basically a minnow dealer."
251476,Moosebunk,2008-09-21 02:04:00,3970,I buy my stuff from about 1032.9 km away.  My local guy has two fish on his wall.  A maybe 7 lb walleye and a 3.5 lb speck.  When he told me the walleye is 12 lbs and the speck 5 lbs his lies began to fester in me like a disease.  Little by little I pulled away from anymore of the sickness.
251494,Jonaton,2008-09-21 05:19:00,72,You need an all of the above option in your poll..
251510,Billy Bob,2008-09-21 12:15:00,5865," Do you think he was giving you some ""BUNK""  LOL  When we had several local bait dealers here I could pick and choose to the one I wanted to buy my bait from but they ALL lied about almost everything when it came to fishing. One guy always gave a glowing report on the lake he was located on. Problem was if you paid attention he said the same thing every spring on where the fish were as well as summer and fall. He was a broken record. If he only spent a little time cleaning up the joint it wouldn't of smell so bad in there and he might be still in business today"
