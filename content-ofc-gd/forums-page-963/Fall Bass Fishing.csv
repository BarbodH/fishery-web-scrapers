251496,CLofchik,2008-09-21 05:42:00,854, Was that before or after he shot the 65lb salmon out of Bronte?  But the fishing has gone downhill in the last few years......now the average is only 30.......
251498,steverowbotham,2008-09-21 06:57:00,1800," And even that is a biased number based on everyone tossing the small fish and keeping only their biggest.  The Canadian tournament record is slightly under 30 pounds for 5 fish ....  29.7 or around that number.  That's almost but not quite a 6 pound average, and trust me, that is NOT an average day of fishing.  A 6 pound average for a lake as a whole is crazy talk, and I would pay big money (myself being a guide) to see a lake in Canada, or anywhere for that matter, where the average bass is 6 pounds."
251588,BillM,2008-09-21 20:18:00,17367,"  Hey Erik,  Once the lake 'turns over' you'll be able to catch fish on a topwater bite, even in the fall.  My last trip to the French River with my dad, that's all we used...   It was the 2nd week in October.  We have the same thing planned for this year"
251599,Jigger,2008-09-21 21:36:00,1237,"I don't get up too early in the fall and find smallies most active mid-day. A warm patch like SingingDog said will bring smallies up shallow to feed. As the water cools, I slow down and gradually go from a horizontal retrieve to a vertical presentation as the season wears on. Obviously, let the fish tell you in the end what they want. But as the water cools, look to use baits with less erratic movement and decrease speed while increasing depth.  And good luck with the 6lb avg thing. Even at this time of year with their bellies at their biggest, thats a VERY low % chance of happening."
251349,Sugarpacket,2008-09-20 10:07:00,82,"Most of people's ""4 pounders"" are 2 pounders. 4 pounds is a really decent fish, 6+ is a trophy.  As for fall, it can really be split into 2 sections. Early fall is when the bass are actually feeding heaviest. The water's still at a warm temperature and as it pushes lower to 60 - 65 the bass start filling their faces as much as possible. They do tend to move deeper but this isn't necessarily the rule. River/creek mouths can keep them in shallow and there are many roamers that simply follow the bait. If the bait is in shallow, they will be too.  Late fall is difficult. Water is frigid and the bass normally move very deep, and become sluggish. The water is lowered past their prime feeding temperature. Though they will still feed daily, it will be in a couple of short bursts throughout the day and the rest of the day will be spent trying to conserve the energy from that meal.  This being said, IMO lakes (down here anyway) are still in the late summer phase. Haven't seen a fall patterned bass yet .. but I don't fish smallies often either. I'm talking mostly largemouth.  Dang Sugarpacket staying logged in!!! This post was by Rich, lol"
251350,singingdog,2008-09-20 10:41:00,1047,"sugarpacket summed it up nicely.  On the shield, early fall can be one of the best times for bass fishing. Not only are they feeding activly, but are often schooled up - both LM and SM: find one and you will often get 3-4 fish in that spot. The trick can be finding these feeding bass. They will normally be shallow, quite often on the 'warm' side of whatever body of water you are fishing. I quite often find them keying on current as well. If they aren't feeding, good luck finding them. Smallies especially can become quite nomadic, moving around all day.  Average 6 lb? Do the math. That means that for every 3 lber you catch, you caught a 9 lber to balance it! Lord help you if you catch a 2 lber...."
251351,love2fishhave2work,2008-09-20 10:54:00,212," I will put your conviction to the test and we will prove to the board your point.  Are you a betting man?  I will pay you $1000 to take me to one of these back lakes and limit a 6 pound average.  Just in case the bite may be off that day, we can do this 3 times on any 3 lakes off your choice.  Are you up for it?"
251365,Rizzo,2008-09-20 13:01:00,4754,hahahaha 6 pound average in Ontario?? This post is hilarious. No way No How. Singingdog summed it up nicely with this comment   are there lakes where you may have a shot at a 6 pounder? Sure. but to average 6 pounds  is impossible.
251386,cram,2008-09-20 15:47:00,1733,There is no lake in the world with 6 lb average smallmouth.  Certainly not in Canada.
251432,Billy Bob,2008-09-20 22:20:00,5865,"I consider Lake Erie the BEST smallmouth lake not only in Ontario but probably the world and at the latest Bass Master Elite Tournament held in Buffalo 7/31 - 8/03/08 the top 106 pro anglers caught 1328 bass weighing 4138 lbs. That's a average of only 3.11  lbs.  Even a small hidden back lake that no one knows about is hard pressed to have a 4 lb bass average.  I don't want to call anyone a liar but maybe your numbers are a little messed up here. If not it's getting a little deep in here, where are my waders"
251433,Rich,2008-09-20 22:21:00,3927,"Plenty of people who don't bring cameras catch 6 pound bass all the time! Heck, my buddy at work tells me all the time how he shot a 14 pounder in his back pond with a bow. What skills."
251467,ehg,2008-09-21 01:03:00,2666,In the fall the bass go deeper. By mid-October I find it hard to find them. Forget about topwaters then.
