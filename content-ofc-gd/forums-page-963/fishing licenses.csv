251362,ccmtcanada,2008-09-20 12:44:00,7971,"This is what the regulations say....  1) Residents of Ontario and Canada under 18, or 65 yrs of age or older, and in possession of their birth certificate  2) Disabled Ontario and Canadian residents, eligible for and in possession of either: - A Canadian Institute for the Blind Card; or - an Ontario Ministry of Transportation Accessible Parking Permit  3) Ontario and Canadian residents in possession of their birth certificate and accompanied by and requiring the direct assistance of another person to fish and to follow applicable fishing laws due to a condition of mental impairment or a development disability , a learning disability or dysfunction or a mental disorder.  Those who qualify to fish without a license must follow the same catch and possession limits as a Sport Fishing License  If you are not sure, then either call an MNR office to ask and to get something back in writing, or just pony up for a $10 one day fishing license.  Good luck."
