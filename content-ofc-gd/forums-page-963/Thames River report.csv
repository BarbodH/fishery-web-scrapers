251640,Spaceman,2008-09-22 00:40:00,2,Yeah I know the web page is hurting. We lost all of our links and photos. I am currently trying to update them but I am not a Joomla expert. It's been by trial and error. The activities page is where you can find out what is going on and when. Heck for $20.00 you can even become a bonified TRAA member.  Space
250036,Beats,2008-09-16 02:13:00,543,"Went out and checked the water levels in some spots on the Thames tonight.  Started at Fanshawe lake and saw that my usual spots were flooded.  I fish from shore, so I need some room to get around and cast.  Left the lake and tried the river and had possibly the best success in my life on the Thames.  First off, let me say that before this year I had never caught a single pickerel in my life.  I made a post ( http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/index.p...c=22658&hl= ) a while back detailing that I had finally started to catch them in the lake.  Well, I started to catch 5 or 6 a night for a while there but they were all small.  I gave myself the goal of catching 50 this season.  Up until tonight I had caught 40 and every one was the same size.  All were between 10-12"" and 1/2-1 lb in weight.  Pretty tiny, but made up for it in numbers.  Gotta remember I am fishing from shore.  Well tonight I caught #'s 41, 42, and 43 and it has to be my greatest day on the Thames (not the lake!).    The fish are 16, 17, and 19.5 "" in length and have a combined weight of 4.75 lbs.  All caught on white power grub with a glow in the dark jighead.  Fished from 7-9 pm and all fish were caught between 8-8:30 pm.  I caught the smallest one first and was overjoyed that I had finally caught one of a different size.   An eater!  About 5 mins later the next biggest, and then about 20 mins after that the biggest.  I couldn't be happier.  I have gone out for I'd guess the last 7 years or so each spring with my dad and never caught or seen a pickerel.  So I had this coming.  The river owed me one.  On that note, not to be rude, but plz don't Pm me asking where the fish were caught.  If you can think of 5 spots or so on the river that hold pickerel, chances are I was at one of them:)"
250037,Casey123,2008-09-16 02:15:00,461,"Congrats,  Great Report!"
250040,PatrickGG,2008-09-16 02:25:00,562,Yummy.
250079,Beats,2008-09-16 03:54:00,543,Never having cleaned a pickerel before I think it turned out ok.  I remember watching a video years ago about removing an extra set of bones.  Found them pretty easily and removed them.    
250092,EC1,2008-09-16 05:46:00,930,"nice stuff, but next time before you throw away all the head tail and bones away, try the cheeks!  eater sizes have the perfect sized cheeks to eat, and man, they are probably the best fish meat ive ever had !  cheers!"
250093,Ramble,2008-09-16 06:11:00,713,those are going to be so damn good.  You know what i had for dinner tonight? Cheep Beef-crap on a bun and rice... I dang' hate rice! ... Want to come over for dinner? I can make some fine chips to go with that fish lol  Congrats  -R-
250098,SlowPoke,2008-09-16 08:47:00,2984,Well done Beats! I was just talking to another London OFNer tonight about some Thames spots... I really have to get my butt out there! I'm surprised you got into some fishable areas at all. I saw the Nith and Grand rivers overflowing and like chocolate milk tonight. -Brian
250108,modny,2008-09-16 10:00:00,502,i just drooled on my keyboard
250109,Paully,2008-09-16 10:18:00,712,NIce catch Beats! Like EC1 said... next time try the cheeks!
250115,Rich,2008-09-16 11:00:00,3927,"Agreed with the others - pickerel cheeks are the ""tenderloin"" of the fish world!  Nice 'eyes, certainly sounds like you had a great time. Glad also to see Thames pickerel numbers are getting better again."
250122,ChrisK,2008-09-16 11:12:00,2772,Just to add another note to parts of walleye that are quite tasty....We do a thing called walleye wings..Its a part of the fish that regularly gets tossed away after filleting. Its the big chunk of meat just below the gills that the pectoral fins are attached too or I think thats what those fins are called...We cut that out fins and all and fry them up in the pan with a fish crisp or whatever  batter coating available...Supprisingly enough there is alot of meat on them wings. Enjoy !!  Cheers !!
250125,b2kptbo,2008-09-16 11:19:00,1505,"Nice pickeral, good job on the cleaning..."
250126,fishing n autograph,2008-09-16 11:21:00,2540,"You could always do what i do......cook on a cedar plank....all you have to do is ""gut"" the walleye and remove the gills etc and you have the entire fish flakey....mmmmmmm walleye......   yeah, i know, i only caught one by Zehrs has them on sale usually!"
250127,Beats,2008-09-16 11:26:00,543,"  From watching Chronzy all these years I have seen and been aware of the eating of pickerel cheeks, ""wings"", and fins.  I was thinking of the cheeks last night for the big one and partially removed one piece but it seemed so small I figured that either the fish was too small or I had messed something up.  I know you don't get alot of meat but just a little scallop-sized thing, but I also couldn't remember the rule of thumb for what size of fish is best to take cheeks from.  I remember hearing somewhere that if a fish is rougly ______ in size, then it's big enough to take the cheeks from.  Either way, I'll make more of an effort on the next big one."
250153,Reef Runner,2008-09-16 12:57:00,980,"Nice catches dude!  Great job on the filleting, that's gonna make a tasty meal.  Congrats on the PB, all of them, lol."
250154,Headhunter,2008-09-16 12:58:00,5703,Way to go Beats! You've put in your time and are now reaping the rewards! Congrats man! I don't know where you were on the river and I don't wanna know! But I will say that you have earned your success! Congrats! HH
250170,tbayboy,2008-09-16 14:08:00,1497,Congrats Beats - nice to see efforts paying off like that.  Sure looks like a tasty dinner to me!
250175,Wild,2008-09-16 14:19:00,704,I'd say that's a pretty respectable job there Beats!  And the leftover parts for the fish are great for the garden so don't waste them.
250253,Tom McCutcheon,2008-09-16 18:33:00,627,Beats;  years ago I sharpened  an old table spoon in order to just scoop out the cheeks. Still works well whenever I get a chance to use it.  Tom.
250306,jjcanoe,2008-09-16 21:53:00,744,  I'm sure those fish were caught in one of the spots I mentioned to you Brian..  Good job Beats I remember that post where you outlined your plan for getting a hold of Mr. Walter in the Thames this year and It looks like you did really well.  jjcanoe
250403,Dano,2008-09-17 02:10:00,719,"MMMmmmm, thats a great report! Congrats on the fish."
250466,Leecher,2008-09-17 13:15:00,7832,Great report and pics Beats  Looks like your persistence paid off....Congrats on your PB Thanks for sharing Leechman
251276,Spaceman,2008-09-19 22:36:00,2,You can thank the Thames River Anglers Association for all the work they have done and are currently doing to create a walleye fishery in Fanshawe Lake and the North branch of The Thames. Without their efforts none of this would be possible. I also hope everyone is aware of the new regulations for Zone 16 now. Limits of 4 and 2 respectively with 3under 18.1 inches and 1 over. Conservation license is 1 and 1. I hope people are smart enough to limit their kill and don't kill their limit.  Spaceman.
251287,Beats,2008-09-19 22:49:00,543,"The fish pictured aren't from the lake or above the lake.  I am well aware of the TRAA's work and past projects and I have been considering membership for a while now.  I have met, and spoken with, many members whom I have randomly met along the river.  Most have been a great source of info for me with regards to learning more about the creeks, stocking programs etc of the Thames.  Too bad their website has been totally out of date for a really long time.  I have been checking it for months and all their past projects etc are dead links.  http://www.anglers.org"
251288,steelheader42,2008-09-19 22:59:00,44,I agree with spaceman.... Myself l would like to see it all Catch and Release but thats just my thinking
