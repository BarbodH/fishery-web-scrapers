The best action was late morning until past noon.  we caught a few ugly coho and jack salmon including a couple of brutes that tore drag and pulled the boat around for 5-10 minutes.  From what I saw another group of guys caught a few too, others not so much.  Thanks to Slowpoke for recommending the Heartland rod.  It performed great for catching and even for casting.  This one was not a contender for the largest but was the prettiest of the uglies:"

251493,SlowPoke,2008-09-21 04:53:00,2984,"I'm glad you were able to break in the new rod! They're a great rod for the money and the best part is, you can snap off the top three eyes and shoot pool with it. -Brian"

251624,forrest,2008-09-21 23:52:00,1032,  lol. I never thought of shooting pool with it but for $30 it would be worth a try.
