251246,tomO,2008-09-19 19:45:00,363,Is it worth stopping at the border to convert my american money into canadian. If I'm reading the currency converter right american's worth about 5 cents more than canadian.
251255,John,2008-09-19 20:27:00,2956,"My .02 here is to put whatever you can on credit card, you get the best rate of exchange that way. Or alternatively get Canadian cash from the bank machines here, there are lots of them. I would try to avoid using American $ as your exchange rate at most places will be non existent."
251303,TennesseeGuy,2008-09-20 00:08:00,957,"mudd, where are you going and when?  Should be nice up there right now."
251329,oxcowboy,2008-09-20 01:56:00,544,"dont change at the border, they will rip you off, in august, it was less for american.  i would recomend the credit card way or atm,  even some of the banks charge a fee, which makes it even money.  on xm converter it is always higher than what they will give.  jason"
251338,danc,2008-09-20 02:48:00,4677,I exchanged $500.00 Canadian for American today. Cost me $35.00. Tomorrow it might cost you $34.00 or $36.00. It's not worth worrying about IMHO.
251356,Billy Bob,2008-09-20 11:36:00,5865,Credit card is almost the best way but surely the most convenient way to go. My credit card company charges 1% to convert my money as do most other credit cards.  If you really want to go with cash the BEST by far is stopping at Fort Erie Race Track and going into the CASINO part. They ALWAYS give the best exchange rate and they are only 2 minutes from the Peace Bridge with easy in and out off the QEW. I have done this several times and if the wife is with me I let her play the slots for 5-10 minutes. A couple times she hit enough to pay for our fishing licenses
251371,JohnF,2008-09-20 14:13:00,3494,"Unless you're changing thousands of dollars don't worry about it. If you wait till you get to Canada and need to use cash most tourist areas will allow reasonable exchange and if you feel better about it, go to a bank and exchange some. There's always a little premium for exchange wherever you do it. As DanC said, for a few hundred bucks it'll cost you a couple of bucks each way. It's not worth worrying about.  JF"

251446,Billy Bob,2008-09-20 23:12:00,5865,I fished Big Gull Lake several times. Stayed at Kirk's Kove. The walleye and pike fishing was always good with smallmouth bass being on the small side. But I was always there in July.  Good Luck and give a report on how you do.   Bob
