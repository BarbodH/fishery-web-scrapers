251383,johnnyb,2008-09-20 15:17:00,3413,"So, I know it's really warm out and we have what looks like a fantastic fall fishing season shaping up....but soon there will be a portion of my evenings spent prepping the ice gear.  More importantly, I could end up being on the market for a new reel, so the more time I have to shop, the better. HERE's the question:  When ice-fishing...we're talking about the jigging rod here...do you prefer a spinning reel or baitcaster on your rod? whoops, I screwed up on that post...hit enter too soon and wrecked the poll!  Ok, so forget the poll....spinning or baitcaster?"

251400,limeyangler,2008-09-20 17:27:00,5204,"hey johnny,  i dont think its too early to think about icefishing....personally i cant hardly wait to walk out on the ice! Anyway.....i have never used a baitcaster before so i would have to say spinning reel...lol. I do however prefer rear drag systems, especially on the ice where  my usual target is large lake trout and whitefish. I like to leave the rear drag setting on its lowest setting which has the effect of freespool...so when the trout hits it can take line.....the ratchet whizzing off line is my bite indicator (love that noise!) and because i tend to use circle hooks on my dropper line set ups, you just pick up the rod without spooking the fish, gradually tighten the drag....the circle hooks set themselves....and there ya have it ,   trout for supper. As its not uncommon for me to be out there  in -40 degrees C (i cnt afford an ice shelter yet either  ) trying to adjust drag is easier with rear drag when wearing 10 pairs of arctic gloves....lol.     CANT WAIT TO DO SOME OF THIS  <embed width=""448"" height=""361"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" wmode=""transparent"" src=""http://i263.photobucket.com/player.swf?file=http://vid263.photobucket.com/albums/ii158/vishuscirquel/MVI_0233.flv"">     MY FAVOURITE ""DROPPER LINE' SET UP     Tanks for posting this topic.......cant wait!"
251403,jwl,2008-09-20 18:06:00,1056,"probably not much help, but all my stuff is spinning gear so that's my prefference, and always will be..I target eyes, and pike for my icefishing missions"
251404,Leecher,2008-09-20 18:23:00,7832,"I know that this reply is not what you had ask but this is the setup that I use down in my area. I use tip-ups that I make myself rigged with spools.  Here a couple of pics of the top      Here a pic of the top and bottom    You can ajust tension on the reel and sensitivity on the top by moving the nail up or down This model is my latest creation  and to answer your question, I have a jigging rod with a spinning reel but don't use often.  I prefer this setup.  Leechman"
251410,wallyboss,2008-09-20 19:19:00,1095,Spinning reels is the way to go I think.  Just got to be sure to buy good ones. With good anti-reverse and a good drag.  Put some good quality grease and oil in it and you should be fine.
251440,kemper,2008-09-20 22:57:00,2232,"Ice fishing?  The hell you say!?  Winter is a time for beer and wings! DANG!   oh, and busting the ice out of my favourite run to slam steelies..."
251455,Rich,2008-09-21 00:06:00,3927,Spinning for me. I just don't get enough sensitivity from a baitcaster's rather heavy line. Need all the sensitivity I can get when my hands are numb. haha
251459,Casey123,2008-09-21 00:30:00,461,"Spinning for walleye and pearch.  Baitcaster for Pike and Lakers.  Set up the baitcaster on a 32"" Rod and use 10lb braid.  Lets on hear anymore about icefishing till December..OK?"
251460,Hawg Hunter,2008-09-21 00:34:00,204,never too early to talk ice fishing lol i use a jigging stick(old school lol) but from being a guide on Quinte for almost 25 years ive noticed 95% of the folks i take ice fishing use spinning reels.  Taker easy  Hawg Hunter
251464,bigugli,2008-09-21 00:53:00,6138,Spinning reel or another homemade black spool creation.
251475,jwl,2008-09-21 01:43:00,1056,"I like this lil invention myself........spring loaded with 2 settings,one for light bites, one for heavier bites.....get a nibble it springs back like a moustrap.  Thought I would share seeing as there where some good homemade ideas on the table....here is mine  I gave this one away as a prize last season"
