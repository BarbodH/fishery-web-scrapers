251364,pikehunter,2008-09-20 12:51:00,1659,"I just opened an Email and thought that the poem at the bottom was good enough to pass along to other OFC'rs. Don't want to create a hoopla about the Carbon Tax, I just thought the poem was good.  Have a good weekend everyone and catch some fish!    I have to work and as I'm in my 5th day of an 8 day work stretch don't have the time to enjoy the great weather.  The Carbon Tax.  Politicians have, in the past, used that old bull%#$@ phrase of 'cutting taxes' to get you to vote for them. Now, Stephane Dion, has come up with a  new wrinkle on that old lie : Tax your heating oil and anything else you  burn to move your food and everything else that you have  always had in your life... but, he'll lower your income taxes.  CONSIDER THIS from a one person who has bothered to do the homework:  When a politician's lips move, I know he's  probably lying. Mr. Dion says his carbon tax will be revenue neutral. So, I went online and  found a carbon calculator and keyed in the annual energy consumption for our household and learned we produce 17 tons of greenhouse gas. Fully 60% of this usage is for electricity which we use to heat our home. I have already improved insulation in my walls and replaced my windows and doors; use the new 'twirley' lights and ensured that my appliances are all Energy Star products. In the past 20 years, these measures reduced my electricity usage from 24,000 Kw Hrs per year to 16,000 Kw Hrs per year last years. What is my reward for this improved efficiency? My power bill is unchanged from what it was 20 years ago. But, my power bill would attract a carbon tax of $104 in year one of Mr. Dion's plan and $ 416 in year four. My power bill would rise from $166 per month to $210 per month in year four. Since I live on a fixed income consisting of CPP and Old Age Security, my income tax bill runs at less than $200 per year. So, for my household, Mr. Dion's 'revenue neutral' carbon tax will cost me $416 per year less income tax reductions of about $10 per year. Revenue neutral? In a pig's eye! This is a tax on seniors living on fixed incomes. Well, Mr. Dion, you haven't got a snowball's chance in hell of ever  getting my vote. I hope everyone else takes five minutes to run the same calculations I did and vote to send this joker to the  political boneyard. Jon C. Coates -  70 Ridgevalley Rd. - Halifax, N.S. - B3P 2J9  Factual data substantiating this: 16.96 tons 60% of this is for electricity or 10.4 tons/year @ $10/ton in year 1 = $104 or $9/mo @ $20/ton in year 2 = $208 or $18/mo @ $30/ton in year 3 = $312 or $27/mo @ $40/ton in year 4 = $416 or $40/mo Income tax paid is $110/yr.    DON'T BUY INTO THE CARBON TAX !  DON'T BELIEVE ANY POLITICIAN FROM ANY PARTY!  PASS THIS ON TO EVERYONE IN YOUR ADDRESS BOOK IN  CANADA .  The Tax Poem  At first I thought this was funny...then I realized the awful truth of it. Be sure to read all the way to the end!  Tax his land, Tax his bed, Tax the table At which he's fed.  Tax his tractor, Tax his mule, Teach him taxes Are the rule.  Tax his work, Tax his pay, He works for peanuts Anyway!  Tax his cow, Tax his goat, Tax his pants, Tax his coat. Tax his ties, Tax his work, Tax his dirt.  Tax his tobacco, Tax his drink, Tax him if he Tries to think.  Tax his cigars, Tax his beers, If he cries Tax his tears.  Tax his car, Tax his gas, Find other ways To tax his ass.  Tax all he has Then let him know That you won't be done Till he has no dough.  When he screams and hollers;  Then tax him some more, Tax him till He's good and sore.  Then tax his coffin, Tax his grave, Tax the sod in Which he's laid.  Put these words Upon his tomb, 'Taxes drove me to my doom...'  When he's gone, Do not relax, It's time to apply The inheritance tax.  Accounts Receivable Tax Airline surcharge tax Airline  Fuel  Tax Airport  Maintenance  Tax Building Permit Tax Cigarette Tax Corporate Income Tax Death Tax Dog License Tax Driving Permit Tax Excise Taxes Federal Income Tax Federal Unemployment (UI) Fishing License Tax Food License Tax Gasoline Tax ( too much per litre) Gross Receipts Tax Health Tax Hunting License Tax Hydro Tax Inheritance Tax Interest Tax Liquor Tax Luxury Taxes Marriage License Tax Medicare Tax Mortgage Tax Personal Income Tax Poverty Tax Prescription Drug Tax Property Tax Provincial Income Tax Real Estate Tax Recreational Vehicle Tax Retail Sales Tax Service Charge Tax School Tax Telephone Federal Tax Telephone Federal, Provincial and Local Surcharge Taxes Telephone Minimum Usage Surcharge Tax Vehicle License Registration Tax Vehicle Sales Tax Water Tax Watercraft Registration Tax Well Permit Tax Workers Compensation Tax  STILL THINK THIS IS FUNNY?  Not one of these taxes existed 100 years ago, and our nation was one of the most prosperous in the world.  We had absolutely no national debt, had a large middleclass, and Mom stayed home to raise the kids.  What in the hell happened?  Can you spell 'politicians?'"
