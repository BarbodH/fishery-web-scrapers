251069,snagmaster,2008-09-19 01:42:00,250,"Johny bass and I headed up to simcoe last week to target largies and smallies. As of last week our summer smallie spots were pretty much dry...fish must have moved to 20 to 30 FOW already (fall pattern). We checked out a couple smallie spots with no luck so decided to hit up some flippin jig largies action. We caught four or Five in an hour or so. No real hogs, Biggest was 4lbs.      Only had about 20 min of daylight left and we wanted some smallies....went to a spot near by and got a double header...a 4lber and a 2.5lber...Nice way to finish an eveing fish      We had to work for our fish But was a great day on the water.  Thanks for reading and goodluck on the water."
