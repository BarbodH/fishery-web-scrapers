251198,Bernie,2008-09-19 16:28:00,3190,Today we had a couple older cars in. This 62 Vette is pristine. Would make it to Barrett-Jackson if the guy wanted to sell. 327CI and a powerglide.   The Firebird looks good from far but far from being good. Remember Smokey and the Bandit?  Had a 78 Z28. Wish I still had it. Just thought I would share.

251205,motv8tr,2008-09-19 16:54:00,2587,Not as sweet as the '58 Red with white that I covet but still very nice....now if you get a 58/59 300SL in the shop I'll break all speed limits to get to it  Maureen
251213,SlowPoke,2008-09-19 17:15:00,2984,"Very nice speciman Bernie, I'll bet it was a pleasure to work on! I think that Firebird would make it to Barrett Jackson - it's only 2400KM to MIami  I just saw a pretty rare bird two days ago... an orange 1973 SD455. Rare enough that I think it might be the one a friend of mine owned in Oakville about 20 years ago. Had a few hair raising rides in that car!  -Brian"
251215,Reef Runner,2008-09-19 17:18:00,980,"Drool!  Those are some very, very nice cars Bernie.  Wow!  That 'vet is one of my dream cars. Gorgeous.  My uncle retires in a couple years and he's gonna start to rebuild his all original '69 Roadrunner that had been in the garage since the late 70's, can't wait!"
251290,1Harringtona,2008-09-19 23:03:00,77,Those are some very nice cars so I thought that I would share my classic. its a stock 93 Honda Civic. LOL.      
251292,Muskieman,2008-09-19 23:10:00,2472,"Nice rides Bernie.....did you call ""B*N*ON' in the Bay for parts?  I like cars a little myself"
