My father called me today asking what is the best VOIP phone service in his area...so I said I had no clue...   So, is there any OFC'er out there in his area (Burnt River area between Fenlon and Kinmount off 121) that has a VOIP service that is either bad or great?  He's looking at a few VOIP providers (Vonage is the front runner) right now.  Feel free to post here or PM me, thanks all!  Geoff"

Since Voice Over IP is basically using your internet connection to make phone calls, therefore your father's internet connect better be not fast but stable.  Not sure if he is using cable or dsl internet but quality of the line must be fairly good and stable.  Especially upload too. If all works well, audio quality is better than landline, that is for sure.   If not voice quality could be lower with few side effects like slight delay, audio breaking up & sudden disconnection.  Most importantly, power goes out... phone goes out unlike landline."

Really cool feature is my voicemails are automatically emailed to me, so I can get them anywhere. You can also bring your phone with you to anywhere that has high-speed, which is kinda cool."
