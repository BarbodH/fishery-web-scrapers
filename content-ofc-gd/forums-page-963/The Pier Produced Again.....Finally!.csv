251086,ccmtcanada,2008-09-19 02:42:00,7971,"Well, Bly and I have been out 3 times to local piers in the past week without having any luck at all.  In fact, it seemed no one was having luck while we were out there.  Anyhow, we went out again tonight and began rinsing off our cleos and it seemed that it was going to be one of those nights yet again, but we know that eventually the skunk will be shaken off.  Tonight was the night.  After throwing spoons for about an hour, on one retrieve I feel what may be the bottom or maybe a weed.  We are fishing in about 25 feet of water so you just never know if you are touching bottom or not.  Anyhow, I kept on retrieving and about 3 seconds later I feel a distinct hit!  I set the hook and........nothing.  Damn it!!  That could be my only hit of the night.  I keep the retrieve going and about 20 seconds later, it slammed my lure.  I could tell right away it was a smaller one, but it sure felt good to hook into it.  Here it is....a smaller 32"" one, that had just started to turn colour....so it was mostly shiny. "
251087,Dondorfish,2008-09-19 02:47:00,1000,Nicely done Cliff  - persistance paid off . . . . . . . . . .  - and I promise - no nail polish on this one - lol     Don   
251089,tbayboy,2008-09-19 02:57:00,1497,"Nice stuff Cliff, persistance pays off after all!"
251091,salmon,2008-09-19 03:09:00,334,"Way to go Cliff This year it has been totally wierd, I have still to land one this year. Maybe this weekend Jose"
251093,Wild,2008-09-19 03:32:00,704,A respectable catch Cliff and it's a purdy one! Sure looks dark out there though how well does the LED light up the area?
251096,sharper,2008-09-19 04:16:00,279,"Beautiful salmon, hasn't really changed colors yet. Good Job!"
251099,mikeymikey,2008-09-19 05:24:00,376, maybe this sunday morning ?
251111,Tarzan's Jane,2008-09-19 11:11:00,1183,"Nice fish...I don't think it's small...well maybe a tad smaller than mine...in my dreams of course, in my dreams   haha"
251114,MCTFisher9120,2008-09-19 11:17:00,3761,Nice fish man.
251124,ccmtcanada,2008-09-19 11:56:00,7971," LOL...thanks Don...you've already let the secret out though....   The bite has been slower for me as well....keep at it though...still lots of time!      When I was fighting it and saw the light colours (almost chrome in the water), I was hoping I caught an early steelhead.  I was very surprised at the colour.  It was a lot nicer then the one I caught in 50 feet of water out in Lake on last weekend!"
251129,ricoboxing,2008-09-19 11:59:00,398,"nice job, if only i could stay awake that late!"
251132,tributaryhunter,2008-09-19 12:33:00,108,"very nice, one of these days i'll have to meet up with u for some steelie action"
251146,Leecher,2008-09-19 13:21:00,7832,WTG Cliff A real beaut for sure  Thanks for sharing Leechman
251153,BITEME,2008-09-19 13:58:00,1969,Your really liking that Poo eh!!!!!!!!!
251174,Reef Runner,2008-09-19 15:16:00,980,"Good job Cliff and a dandy fish.  If you could be hitting the bottom in 25fow, how fast are you retrieving those cleo's?  Are you letting it flutter, short retrieve, flutter? or constant?  I haven't had any luck on spoons yet this year, and so are the other fisherfolk I talk to, just wondering if you are using a specific retrieve to entice them chinny's."
251184,BITEME,2008-09-19 15:40:00,1969, slow slow slow if your losing 1 or 2 cleos a nite to the rock gods your doing it right
251186,fishinggeek,2008-09-19 15:49:00,325,"Nice one.  I can never manage any luck.  Any spoons cheaper than cleos that work?  Also do you move around a lot, or stay in one spot?  I'd imagine salmon move around a lot, so maybe I don't have to."
251189,BITEME,2008-09-19 16:10:00,1969,pick a spot and fish it and yes there are cheaper lures get glow in the darks with flouresent orange on half the face and find a flash
251195,Scott S,2008-09-19 16:23:00,203,"Nice fish Cliff. The Salmon have to be close to running now, and the bows not too far behind! Scoter"
251207,Reef Runner,2008-09-19 17:01:00,980,"Thanks Bite me, guess my problem is a quick retrieve.  On another note, it was last week since I attended, however, LeB's in Missisauga had a bin full of glo cleos on sale for $2 or $3 pending on size.  I got maybe 6 of them.  Check it out, maybe they're still around."
251209,ccmtcanada,2008-09-19 17:05:00,7971, Yep...Biteme schooled me in the art of Pier Salmon catching.
251210,Reef Runner,2008-09-19 17:07:00,980,"  lol, now you're schooling them salmon Cliff.  Good job and thanks to both of you!"
251211,ozaibak1,2008-09-19 17:12:00,401,"Hahaha a 'small one' I'd be so thrilled to catch that, nice job! Patience pays off I guess... it must be worth the skunks."
251270,salmon,2008-09-19 21:50:00,334," Your are a sick puppy. Stop following me aorund with that net LOL.  Save me a rock. I will not be as nice this time if anyone takes my spot while I am helping land someone elses fish. Watch out  Jose Calcutta 200B, St. Croix Avid 9 1/2 ft Calcutta 200GTB, St. Croix Avid 10 1/2 ft So watch out for my backcast (remember what happened last time?)"
