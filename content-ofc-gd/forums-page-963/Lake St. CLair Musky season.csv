He called and asked when the earliest date we could get out with a particular crew that he was reffered, and the earliest is Oct.25 ?????  to me that seems to be awfully late in the season.... but i could be wrong ?  So would it be worth it ?...$500 for 4 people ! Oct. 25 ?  Thanks"

251272,jwl,2008-09-19 22:14:00,1056,"Late Oct is a great time for musky fishin, many don't even start thier musky fishing season hardcore until October through the really crappy cold weather months until close, I know I will be trying a few places in October, I got my 3 biggest ever in 3 different Octobers"
251373,Rizzo,2008-09-20 14:27:00,4754,"if you got the $$$$, go for it. like others have said, october is great. I fish musky in the niagara right up to close in december (when the water isn't chocolate milk that is). I usually do the best in late October early november so you appear to be right on schedule"
251384,Carp,2008-09-20 15:22:00,1488,"You should listen to Rizzo. He's able to hook the same ski in the same spot, three weeks in a row and release it without having to put it in a net, in the boat or even use pliers. Now that's talent.  Sorry Rizzo. I'm still thinking about your adventure and couldn't resist taking another jab.   Definitely a good time of year for ski fishing. $500/4people. 125$ each doesn't seem too bad. Should be a good time. Don't forget to post and get some pics for us too.  Good luck lunker777 !!!"
