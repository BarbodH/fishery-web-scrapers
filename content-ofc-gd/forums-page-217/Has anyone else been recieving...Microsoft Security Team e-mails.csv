We've had them call here countless times and even called Sue a liar when she told them our computer was fine. That's when I got on the phone!!!!!!! Last time they called she told the guy to hold on for a second, she'd put him through to our fraud division; he hung up right then and there."

I recently had to verify my email by entering a code that they sent to a different email, they also provided the option of a text.  However, they did not send an email; the request only came when I tried to sign in.  They already had my email and telephone number; they request this info when you create an account.  Requesting someone else's email does not make sense."
