870103,John Bacon,2014-08-30 21:32:00,3277,It is quite surprising how far up on the rocks these boats can get and still look like boats.  I would have expected a lot more damage to boat that hit land that hard.

870112,DRIFTER_016,2014-08-30 22:56:00,10439,Had the same thing happen in Port Hope in the late 80's early 90's. The guy was coming back from the US and had it on auto pilot. He was drunk and passed out. He ended up in the park on the West side of the Credit.
870113,lew,2014-08-30 23:44:00,12766,Years ago my brother knew a guy in Brockville that was killed along with 3 buds when their off shore style racing boat hit some type of structure on the St. Lawrence River doing an estimated 100  MPH in the dark.
870120,fishindevil,2014-08-31 06:27:00,6254,The boat might have been stolen ?? Or they were drunk and took off !!!!! Or another Darwin Award contestant !!!!! ...... Another reason for the powers that be to keep on raiding insurance rates and licensing !!! Boats that big should be made to take additional courses like the power & sail course and how to operate the big boats !!! Most don't even know how to set their trim tabs anyways .... The gong show in action ..... Unreal ....

870157,Garnet,2014-08-31 16:06:00,2056,"I was working on a charter boat 20 years ago when a new boater with new boat launched in Port Credit and went east at 30 miles/hr until he hit the Bonnie Bra shoal in Oshawa. Basically beached the boat, which was very lucky. Another mile and he would have hit Oshawa pier dead on. In heavy fog."
