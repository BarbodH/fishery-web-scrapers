If you don't find anyone close by that can help you out, let me know! Thanks Cliff It may be time to replace it as it's our main entry point and it gets used a LOT! But here is the problem.   Here is my problem it happens more times than not  A Sears model opener 1/2 hp about 13 years old, I have two, but this one door get used extensively, it's our main entrance . . . .  Going up with a remote (in car) or push button outside or inside everything works fine. But on occasion(s) when I close it, it will go down and reverse right away OR go halfway and reverse this happens with all three wall inside, outside by the door and remote (in car) . . . I have aligned the sensors and they are free of any obstruction, I even cleaned the glass.  If I hold down the wall-mounted units it will close every time L  At times everything works fine for a while and then it goes back  . . ."
870573,Big Cliff,2014-09-03 14:03:00,6899,"Had the same issue, when the sun was shining on the sensor at just the right angle it would do that."
870576,ketchenany,2014-09-03 15:02:00,3229,"Had the same issue, when the sun was shining on the sensor at just the right angle it would do that. Well this happens even in the dead of night lol"
870581,ssminnow,2014-09-03 15:55:00,48,It sounds like your sensors need to be replaced.  I had the same problem a couple years ago.  I think I got replacement ones at home depot for about $30.  Quick easy fix.  You could also swap the sensors with the other opener first to verify if that is the problem.
870582,glen,2014-09-03 16:20:00,2641,Mine have done that too. Do you have a setting for closing force on the motor housing.   The door may be hard to close. Try disconnecting the door from the chain.  Then move the door by hand to see if it moves without binding.
870611,Big Cliff,2014-09-03 22:37:00,6899,Well this happens even in the dead of night lol How bright was the moon

870624,Gerritt,2014-09-04 00:47:00,6129,"Sounds to me like the limit switch is being tripped. Seen this myself with my own opener, and solved this issue several times for others all because of the same issue...  Springs over time become weaker, adding more force against the door. Adjust your limit ""switches"" or adjust your spring( add a couple turns)  Should solve your issue.  G"
870625,vance,2014-09-04 00:51:00,719,The same thing was happening to me and after trying a most of the things mentioned here I lubricated the track the wheels run in. The problem was immediately solved and the door was a lot quieter to boot.  vance
870658,ketchenany,2014-09-04 11:11:00,3229,As I mentioned it will be fine for a while and then go back to acting up  Vance what kind of lub did you use. I was told many years ago NEVER put grease in the track!  Cliff it was a super moon!
870665,vance,2014-09-04 11:47:00,719,I just used some wheel bearing grease that i had sitting around but just about anything would do.  vance
870669,Big Cliff,2014-09-04 12:20:00,6899,"I just used some wheel bearing grease that i had sitting around but just about anything would do.  vance Wheel bearing grease can get pretty stiff in cold weather. I often see snow blowers that guys have cleaned and greased up all nice in the fall, when it gets cold in the winter they can't understand why they are having trouble shifting them. A little light oil might be a better choice IMHO."
870674,lew,2014-09-04 12:29:00,12766,This is what I use on my door tracks and hinges and it works well.  
870681,manjo39,2014-09-04 13:16:00,354,"HI Kethanany,  I had the same issue.  I went to Burrell garage doors on Highway 7.  They sell a garage door lube in an aerosol can similar to what Lew posted.  Lube all the hinges, rollers and other moving metal parts.  Also I have a Chamberlain so not sure if its the same, but I adjusted the 'sensitivity' a little bit and it stopped the reversing half way down issue.  Failing that while your at Burrell ask what they recommend, they gave me some good tips when I was there."

As for putting grease on the track, I was told that any sand or particles that is kicked up will stick to the grease and actually damage the track."

The product I pictured above goes on as a clear liquid then dries and just leaves a slick surface with nothing for any gritty substances to adhere to.  Works well for me anyhoo."
870691,BillM,2014-09-04 14:31:00,17367,"Yeah, I wouldn't be greasing anything on a garage door."
870698,grimsbylander,2014-09-04 16:01:00,3016,This thread is reminding me I need a whole new door and hardware...UGH! I see dollar signs! I guess I should get it quoted as I have no idea what it'll run me.
