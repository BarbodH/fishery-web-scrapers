I fished my local rivers for years, enjoyed what I did....trout from opener until June.  Bass until the season ended.  I would take the odd lake excursion but was happy fishing 3lb smallies against the current.  Until it happened.....  Late last season I was bass fishing and hooked into a river musky....a small 40"".  I caught my second within 20 minutes.   My third and fourth came within weeks.  The long winter was spent collecting musky tackle (a very lucky kijiji deal helped).  I researched the species,  their habits, and waterways on an hourly basis.  That first Musky changed the game.....I found myself huddled in parking lots in January buying Legend Tournament rods from Fisherpete.  Compres at Tim Hortons from Rob Cadeau, talking Muskies to the point of hypothermia (I mean I could have just bought another coffee).  3 Lexas, 1 boat, 1 humminbird si, 5 rods, 1 kicker motor, and countless lures later I figured it was warranted I change my handle.  I drove 2 hours into thunderstorms to fish skis for a few hours this weekend as opposed to driving 10 minutes into clear skies to countless loaded bass holes.  For those who have offered their wisdom along the way it is more than appreciated.   Fisherpete (I now handtie 150lb flouro just off example of the leaders you gave me), Lew (your west arm stuff put the first ski slime on my boat), Speedtroll, and yes,  even Musky or Specks (sorry about the redd survey).  Report/Pics to come for when I figure out how to properly load them.  MuskyMotivated (Ryan)"
