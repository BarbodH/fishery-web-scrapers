869217,Consigliere,2014-08-25 13:51:00,121,"The unstable conditions of the summer are the entirety of the issue.  When cold fronts are coming through ever 2-3 days, the water never has a chance to stabilize and the schools of fish stay closer to the deep water sanctuarys and are very inactive.  The late spring should've been good to everyone but sometimes the fisherman tell the fish where they are supposed to be instead of finding them."
869218,mattybculp,2014-08-25 13:57:00,388,"I think what bill said is bang on.  I had some holidays in early august and it was when the weather really took an ugly turn. Cold, overcast, and windy, which played more mentally on me knowing the fishing would be tough. I Checked out some of the usual spots nothing was happening. So I took that opportunity to go off the board and spend some days scouting new areas and techniques and it ended up being an amazing few days of fishing ( largies, smallies, and walleye) I'm talking numbers and size all three achieved new personal bests both mid 5's for largies and smallies and a 29 inch walleye which on the tri- lakes is pretty decent. I went back out this Saturday to hit up some bass and was off the water by noon because I limited out and what was the point I had 16.6lbs for 4 fish.( which were all released of course.). Sometimes its better to quit when your ahead. Last year was great bass fishing, this year I have found it even better. I'm not finding them in pads or slop but weedflats in open water, but much deeper than last year. So I would say what ever your usual spots and presentations are, if your struggling, change it up, search for new water and try new techniques(as Bill M said), and the best part of it is for me, is that I just added 5 new spots to my milk run. It was definitely a confidence booster for me."
869244,mike rousseau,2014-08-25 15:08:00,4661,"Fishing is definitely different this year...  Funny thing is weed growth is amazing here...  Musky are biting like crazy...  But walleye seam moody.... Not on the same spots...  Not feeding at historical times... Not as many ""big"" walleye this year...  Other funny thing... All fish have been following bite windows like crazy this year... Very predictable...."
869261,glenner,2014-08-25 17:35:00,56,"Same with me, lots of work for fewer fish. Last year the numbers of walleye caught by my fishing buddies and I were really good, with the only problem being lots of fish caught that were over the legal size. This year started with good numbers but lots of smaller fishe being caught. Now, like many others are saying, August has been really tough fishing. Some reliable spots just haven't produced at all this season, while the best fishing seems to be in some areas that typically don't produce. The one constant has been Muskies, it's been hard to keep them off the line this year and I have lost a lot of worm harnesses to those toothy brutes."
869327,msp,2014-08-25 22:51:00,1336,"Im having a crappy season so far. Almost every day that I had to go fishing it was bluebird skies , no wind. Getting sunburnt fishing spring walleye and pike sucks. Not ideal conditions for any species."
869333,misfish,2014-08-25 22:56:00,29133,"HMMMMMMM  It has been different,that,s for sure,But cant say I can complain.  Been having a great fun year. Just waiting to get the pin out."
869374,fishdawg,2014-08-26 01:09:00,912,It's has definitely been the most difficult year in recent memory for Lake Ontario salmon and trout anglers. A consistent thermocline never set up and Fish have been scattered throughout the Lake and have been tricky to pattern. The proof is in the pudding if you check out results from all the major tournaments both Ont and NY. Many of.the best full-time pros have struggled to get 5 or 6 required mature salmon for their box.  On the plus side the bait (alwive) is flourishing.
869408,fishindevil,2014-08-26 07:44:00,6254,The walleye fishing was stellar in the spring but up north in Haliburton the rain came again & again and high water & cold temps and it sure changed fish locations & their feeding habits specially the lack of weeds !!! But man I have got some real tank smallies and have had  to work for them but that's fine with me and has made it a challenge for sure !!!!  The lakes and area I fish the fish are deeper for sure this year but once you get into a good program it's been awesome !!! Keep changing things up and trying areas is the key
869508,MrSimon,2014-08-26 16:52:00,217,"This year I really learned to use my electronics to find fish  .... and then I worked on my drop shot technique a lot.  I started really tweaking the settings on my graph and did a lot of research on how to actually KNOW what I'm looking at.  In terms of the drop shot, I dialed in my presentation, which required learning some new boat control skills.  It paid off big time.  I caught my personal best walleye and smallie on the St. Lawrence this year.  Its funny how the smallest things can make all the difference."
869644,Musky or Specks,2014-08-27 03:09:00,2710,So as an exammple here my fav smallmouth river this summer. The Lower it is the better    Guess I'm going fishing tommorow or I might miss it
869646,wall i,2014-08-27 03:47:00,48,Been a good year however the fish are in different pattern this year much shallower than in a more typical summer. I use slower presentations and choose my days more carefully. The flip flop in weather has been far more pronounced this summer but I try and go out on days preceeded by some stable weather.
870116,cynmar,2014-08-31 03:11:00,169,"It was a tough year , the 2nd week in July on the south shore of Nipissing the Big mother bass were still on the nest.  I couldn't believe it.  Pickerel were few and far and not even the perch were great.    Could also be because of the ghost gill nets they've been finding as well though."
870123,thegrumpyfisherman,2014-08-31 12:44:00,59,"Could also be because of the ghost gill nets they've been finding as well though.  They're still finding nets?  I went to South River at the mouth once this year in the spring, normally walleye everywhere there.  This year it was almost exclusively a sheephead festival.  We are so fed up with the lack of good fishing there we have found a new lake for our spring/fall trip.  Too bad for the lodge owners, unfortunately if nothing is done about the poor fishing they are going to really suffer."
870135,SirCranksalot,2014-08-31 13:35:00,3291,  My wife is even asking me why I am not going out as much this year   Only shows to go ya-----every cloud has a silver lining!!
870138,Garnet,2014-08-31 13:45:00,2056,fished 6 tournaments won 3 cashed 2 more checks things look normal for cooler year to me.
870147,James77,2014-08-31 15:08:00,175,"I've had the best fishing year of my life, possibly because of my new favourite lure.  I've had my personal best walleye and musky, bass has been slower.  (Lower Buckhorn)"
870148,Fisherpete,2014-08-31 15:14:00,1814,"Spring cats, carp and crappie were great Bass fishing has been average Muskie have been awesome Lake O salmon slow, getting ok numbers but no really big ones"
870212,Wagoneer,2014-08-31 23:39:00,118,"I think it's just a matter of finding the fish this year. It's been a messed up cold/late summer. I think the fish are also confused by it.  I've caught all my biggest fish this season while fishing for a completely different species. Biggest small mouth I caught trolling for musky, biggest pike I caught fishing for top water large mouth, biggest perch I caught while fishing for small mouth. It's just a matter of throwing away your usual techniques from other summers and trying new ones."
869065,thegrumpyfisherman,2014-08-24 13:21:00,59,"I've been reading a lot of comments since I joined that are suggesting 2014 hasn't been a banner year for more than just me.  Yes, I've been catching fish, but I'm really having to work my butt off for it.  Yesterday for example I spent 12 hours at Moon River/Woods Bay, and only managed 4 smallmouth and 3 pike, none of which were exactly trophys!  It's been like this since my spring trip to Onaping.  Mind you I only do inland lakes, maybe larger bodies of water have been better for some?  Even Nippissing this spring was mostly Sheephead which has never happened before to us.  I've read some suggesting weather as one possible culprit, any other ideas?  Is it a matter of the fish are there just not biting?  Are there less fish?  Are they just in different places than usual?  Or am I just a horrible fisherman lol  Tony"
869067,Musky or Specks,2014-08-24 13:43:00,2710,I've been using the excuse that it's a week year class for all species and I'm staying with that.
869069,glen,2014-08-24 13:57:00,2641,It is very sad because my kids don't want to go fishing. The fish are too hard for them to catch.  They want to go out fishing when we are up north and the fishing is good.  Tell me a story that is more sad then that.
869070,Dave Bailey,2014-08-24 14:09:00,1641,"It's been a very good year for me, but that might be because I've lucked into some opportunities that I might not normally get. Let's not forget that the cold spring pushed summer back by a a couple of weeks at least. We were at Killarney from August 9 to 17, and the mosquitoes were out like it was still July."
869073,Moosebunk,2014-08-24 14:27:00,3970,"I've been using the excuse that it's a week year class for all species and I'm staying with that.  Exactly. lol.   It's been a different year all around.  Winter laker numbers were down a little but getting on and off lakes with the big snow was trickier, and more days the hut was needed because of the cold.  Adds up to more energy spent.  Many people on Quinte had a banner ice season though...  Spring... when it finally arrived the timing was off.  Finished with crappie and bows before they even really got going.  Lakers were more scattered with the colder lake temps too, and the walleye were really weird.  Patterns were off, no doubt about it.  Had to work harder... adapt.  Sometimes it was too late.  Gar were about the only thing good to me this year, but they were harder to catch overall too.  Lots of long fish, but overall skinnier.  They were late and slow to put the feed on, and not a good spawning year either.  Only fished one day in the past two months at home.  Been traveling.  Slave great but nothing to compare to, yet Nipigon was different. Weed oriented big pike were tough, specks and lakers good though.  Hear the bass season isn't up to snuff for many, and that muskie in July were slow, but it's improving now.  Not sure how the salmon guys did overall, but judging by reports... it hasn't been a good year..  Fall fishing up next... hope it drags on with sunny, colorful days.  Looking forward to smallies, eyes and skis."
869074,LostAnotherOne,2014-08-24 14:28:00,956,Last year I think I caught a lot more so I think your on to something here bud.  I will call the ministry of natural resources in the morning:)
869076,Sinker,2014-08-24 14:32:00,8692,"The weather has been messed. Up and down like a yoyo all year. Tough winter, late spring, cool summer.....certainly not ""normal""....whatever that is.

869145,i2cool2fool,2014-08-24 21:21:00,349,I have had average success when out fishing this year. My issue has been the weather was poor the majority of times I was available to fish. I even had to cancel a few outings.
869147,landry,2014-08-24 22:18:00,1005,I have has a good summer fishing but I have gone half as often due to high winds. I fish St Clair for muskie and have been 8 times. 7 of 8 trips have been Good to excellent.
869159,Spanky80,2014-08-24 23:58:00,152,"2014 sure has been quite a bit slower for me, kinda relieved to see this thread LOL.  I was starting to take it personally.  Walleye has been slow in my home water (upper Ottawa River) as well as in a couple of the lakes we go to when the river gets too stupid.  Haven't been out as often as we'd like, the fiance and I are fair-weather fisher-folks.  Didn't miss the humidity but less wind and rain would have been nice.  There is always next year...I'm sure the ice fishing won't be too affected though."
869164,SuperDave,2014-08-25 00:44:00,204,"Definitely a tough season. The muskies have just started to show up for me, and the bass fishing has been lousy. Still caught some, but not like previous years. Someone mentioned sheephead ... I am the king of those things this year! I've never seen so many and have caught a couple of big ugly ones."
869165,John Bacon,2014-08-25 01:04:00,3277,Definitely a slow year for me.  I fish Lake Ontario a lot; others seem to have struggled as well.

869167,BillM,2014-08-25 01:07:00,17367,"Been a good season, going in expecting the fish to be in certain places like they were last year definitely isn't going to work however."

I gotta admit Spanky I'm glad to see others have struggled a bit as well, must be pretty bad for this many fisherman to admit they are struggling, being such a proud lot!  I'm still learning, so I asked based on what I've seen around me as well as what I've read.  To go to Massassauga off Georgian Bay and catch 6 small fish in 12 hours something must be up.  I'm pretty new to fishing but thats an area of Georgian Bay where even a bent needle with chewing gum should normally yield more than that!  I tried everything and probably covered 7 miles of water.  Last year the pike and Bass were literally jumping into my boat, makes me wonder where the hek they all are?  Out in the big water?  Thats my third trip since June and its been like that all three times."
869174,MCTFisher9120,2014-08-25 01:29:00,3761,"Been a good season, going in expecting the fish to be in certain places like they were last year definitely isn't going to work however.  I forgot that part, almost 80% of what I caught this year was 5-100yards away from spots i hit last year, fish definitely set up different spots within most areas."
869175,BillM,2014-08-25 01:30:00,17367,"Fishng the same old patterns day after day expecting the fish to be there because they 'should' be isn't going to work.  You've gotta mix it up.   The past two weeks I've been getting most of my big smallies vertical jigging out in open water because they are chasing shiners (Add in some bonus fat walleyes as well).   Did very well on Sat out in Parry Soud fishing weed edges in 10-14ft of water catching some giants on topwater (yes topwater, mid day, bluebird skies go figure)..  This year is definitely not like last year,  Weed growth is way off, water temps are down,etc..  The fish aren't going to be in the same places.  If you spend 15-20mins fishing a certain pattern and it doesn't work, change it up.   Sometimes I'll drive around for a good 15mins watching the graph before I even wet a line.   I love fishing, but I hate wasting time fishing patterns that don't produce.  My oldman gets pissed because we're constantly moving, etc but he doesn't complain when I'm slipping the net under a 6lb smallmouth he nailed off a weed edge fishing a popper"
869184,wkimwes,2014-08-25 03:01:00,76,"The bass fishing for me has been subpar.  Last year I was getting numbers and size, this year I'm not landing the fish in the same spots.  I've tried different areas, landed a fish here and there...I just can't seem to catch the pattern.  Usually I am nailing smallies and have yet to land one (well I didn't count the OOS Smallie).  All largies and pikes.  I'm perplexed!"
869194,bushart,2014-08-25 11:27:00,2628,Yep---survey says----2x the amount of casting for 1/2 the fish  Always remember one constant tho----these fish STILL have to eat----they're likely just doin it elsewhere  They cannot go forever on no grub
869196,i2cool2fool,2014-08-25 11:45:00,349,I don't skip meals and have the gut to prove it. I am sure fish are the same. Find the bait fish areas and you find hungry cruising fish.
869207,bigcreekdad,2014-08-25 12:54:00,546,"I fish the French usually 4 times a season. My first trip in late May produced some good walleye fishing, but only in areas of current. High water and weed growth even in normally thick weed bays was virtually non existent. Next trip in late June produced fabulous walleye fishing wherever there was some weed growth...but very few pike and bass. Last weeks trip was pretty lousy. Where I fished last August and caught bass all day on wacky worms, I caught so few I quit using them. Weed growth was minimal, and so were pike. Never saw a muskie, although I targeted them 3 or so hours a day at least. Only thing that worked consistently, but not constantly, was small poppers on ultralight.  I did see several otters....very cool and more than I've seen in years.  Going back in mid September to target muskies almost exclusively....hoping for better fishing."
869211,AKRISONER,2014-08-25 13:19:00,5558,"The year started pretty well for me, i even had a great day out on Canada day catching pickerels, which is usually a dead weekend by that point as things really slow down once the water warms up on the bay.   Made a trip to the Kawarthas in July and caught a boat load of fish, but really struggled with size.  And then things have come to a screeching halt. Ive put close to 30 hours in fishing since that trip to the kawarthas and all i have to show for it is 1 small mouth and 1 small pike.  I am hoping the continued high water levels in Georgian Bay (relatively) makes for a better run in the rivers come October/November...we shall see."
