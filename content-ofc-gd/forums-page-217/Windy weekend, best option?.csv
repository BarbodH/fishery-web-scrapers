I gotta get out somewhere this weekend and this wind is keeping me off simcoe   I don't know scugog all that well and it's really shallow...last time out to sparrow only got dinks.  Oh and bass are the target  Thanks"

Chatter baits with me secret trailer were the ticket today, got a bunch up the river on wacky rig as well. Finished off the day with a bigeye on a crawler harness at the mouth of the river just for kicks. All fish were returned.  Oh and if anyone gets a big musky or pike with a chatter bait hanging from it the bait is my dads lol Something hit it as soon as it hit the water and just peeled off line until the 15lbs floro leader snapped!  Great Lake!!!"
