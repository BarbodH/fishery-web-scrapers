Exactly, they are meat eaters, and any rodenticide is unlikely to work, Warfarin is a first generation rodenticide, developed in the 1950s and used so much since then that many rodents have developed a resisitance, that would be my last choice for a bait, many others out there more effective, ive been an exterminator for over 30 years and havnt used warfarin based products in at least 25 years, you need to get rid of the white grubs, remove the food the voles or moles will move else where"
870069,Gerritt,2014-08-30 14:12:00,6129,Thank you! After doing a bit of research it appears I have a mole or two making all these mounds. As voles apparently do not make mounds? So the moles are after grubs and not the grass roots? So many different theories out there it is confusing.  G
870070,crappieperchhunter,2014-08-30 15:20:00,2582,Black walnuts hulls might work. I know a neighbour of my parents swore by it for keeping all kinds of critters out of his lawn. Collect the walnuts if you have a source and make a tea and pore it on your lawn. A quick google search will get you all kinds of info. It is very toxic to certain things so use your own judgement.  I have no knowledge of or am I endorsing it's use. Just throwing it out there.

852837,wallyboss,2014-05-09 12:42:00,1095,"Actually you probably have only one mole doing all that damage.   What I did is sat beside my lawn and watched. Got to be real quiet though. And you will see it start pushing some dirt out of the hole.  Make sure you have a couple of shovels with you.  When you see it push some dirt out, watch and look where the trail runs from that hole.  all you need is to use the shovels to block his way out and with the other shovel start stabbing at the ground.  I killed one mole and I haven't seen a trail or a mound of dirt come up since."

All I need is a weekend where I'm not booked solid so I can spend some time out there fixing it!!!

Noticed last week a few holes, today just above my septic a 10 foot area has been ripped to shreds, and although no noted grubs in daylight, when I lifted some grass a strange beetle scurried away.  Not voles doing this, although the damage the OP photographed this spring was evident on the lawn here too. What's here now has to be the work of something bigger than voles... and I did catch whiff of a skunk a week or so ago.  Maybe hiding under the porch too.  Critters like these... KILL 'EM ALL!!!!"

Voles do tunnel and make foraging paths but seem to call a special place home. If you can find that place you can help make them move on. under sheds, under compost heap, so on and so on. Pretend your a vole and look for a reasonable spot to live. Then do whatever means are necassary to make them move on. or in short befriend a dude that works for Orkin or the such."

I had to replace some drainage lines last fall because they got in to them and jammed them up really bad...      I'm open to a more environmentally friendly solution..

You'll also get red flagged making every trip afterwards a guaranteed visit through the vehicle inspection area.
