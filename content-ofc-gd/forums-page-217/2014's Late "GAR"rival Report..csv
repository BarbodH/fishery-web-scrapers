870389,Moosebunk,2014-09-02 01:45:00,3970,"Looks like Rick, Pete, Bill, Chris & Rob will be up next spring.  ROAD TRIP!!!  Plenty space in the country here for pitching a tent and git'in yer gar on.  Bonfire, BBQ, beers and gar!!!   A lot of the guys who fly fish for them don't actually hook them, they just get wrapped up in the long streamers.   I don't think I've even had a fish turn on a streamer, even though it's 6inches from his face.  On flies you miss like 75% Bill... probably way more actually.  And waving the arms all about to cast oftentimes spooks them away.  Thing is, the clearer and deeper the water I find, the less chance you have of getting them to turn even if you present the fly well.  Those days after a wind had stirred up bays on the river to get them muddy, I find is best chance when gar are up sunning and visible.  You can move in closer on the fish and more accurately cast to them. Not only that, they can't inspect the fly as easily and they snap at it not knowing better.  Sometimes, they just keep following and snapping.  Best places to sink a hook, tip of the snout or back into the mouth cause inbetween is a crap shoot.  I remember getting them to hit a small, floating rapala, slow retrieve, just under the surface, Turkey Point,  That'll work Chris... no question.  But a slow retrieve rarely gets results actually, least not here.  Neither does too fast though.  The lure has to be moving and action just right, and rarely does pausing it beside the fish do anything but turn 'em off from biting it.   Same here. Twice this summer I encountered schools of them on the surface over 30plus feet of water. Nary a strike. The one time there were dozens of fish that we sat on for an hour casting everything we could think of trying to get a bite.  Rob... I have never fished or even seen them over that deep.  Maybe run the odd one over accidentally ripping up and down the river.  Again, if they were out over clear water they'd have been tougher to have bite regardless, but keeping at them is the right idea.  Have those lures run just by their eye the same distance as their snout is long.  Those fish must have been migrating to or from somewhere really, don't think they're really much for chasing after open water schools of fish at all... but then again...?   A mask while posing with a fish..........who does that!  Leah does that... and my goof buddy too."
870392,Moosebunk,2014-09-02 01:49:00,3970,"Great report MB - when you are ready to guide and its gar-time, can I ask you send me a pm with some openings?  I can make the time for a trip to that orthodontist  Surely Rick.  Will see what happens in the future."
870402,kickingfrog,2014-09-02 02:21:00,8333," So you know exactly what I'm talking about.   I'm guessing they are going after big schools of shad.   I've even brought out the 6wt and streamers and can't get one to go.  It's discouraging.  We had a lot of time to discuss what we were seeing. I wonder if they are feeding on something other then fish, because the ""rises"" were not like fish being busted on the surface. Or a social thing. At least that's what we told ourselves as we left after over an hour of trying to catch them."

870484,misfish,2014-09-02 20:22:00,29133,"Read the report this morning Drew. When I looked at the time,I had to booked it out to work.  Great report. Love the MARLEY pose.. Having fun. Nice.  Awesome photos as always dude.  Thanks again for taking the time."
870491,aplumma,2014-09-02 21:14:00,6896,Very nice report thank you for taking the time Drew. The gar over deep water are usually rolling to get air. They are catchable but are not actively feeding. The use of cotton corded jigheads or other methods that do not hook the fish but tangle in their teeth need to be used with caution if you are releasing them. Removing all of the fibers is needed so they can feed correctly.   Art
870496,Moosebunk,2014-09-02 21:44:00,3970,"Agreed Art, and thanks.  Hardly ever use rope but do have a couple rope lures with me every time out.  They work well, especially in really weedy areas."

With the O2 levels not an issue in the lake I never really thought of it though."
