869446,LucG,2014-08-26 13:05:00,779,"Went out last Friday in search of some good bass fishing and got treated with a trophy pike.  Started out the morning fishing a Lucky Craft Gunfish (topwater walking bait) and got several good smallies over and on the edges of deeper cabbage, 6-10 fow.  Once the sun came out and got a little warmer, I started targeting pads, grass and wood, and got a few good largies on a texas rigged creature bait.  As I was burning my bait back to the boat to make another flip, this giant northern pike hammered my bait right at the boat and made a line peeling run.  She measured 42"" and had a very big head and was really think. This is my first pike from Ontario that was over 40""       Look and the coloration of these two smallies. One was caught in the river on a sandy and wooden bottom, the other was caught in the weeds.    "
869448,jbailey,2014-08-26 13:12:00,866,wow nice surprise! that's a beauty gator. I guess the big ones are moving in as the water temps drop with this non-existent summer we've had
869449,lew,2014-08-26 13:12:00,12766,Huge pike Luc and some real decent bass to go along with her.

869452,LucG,2014-08-26 13:15:00,779,wow nice surprise! that's a beauty gator. I guess the big ones are moving in as the water temps drop with this non-existent summer we've had  This is what I was thinking. Even found a few places where the smallies have even started to school up. Is summer over already???????
