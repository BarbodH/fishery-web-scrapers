870293,mike rousseau,2014-09-01 16:36:00,4661,Hey everyone...  Gotta redo my floor in my boat...  Is there any reason I can't lay a sheet of aluminum instead of wood? Just a thought...
870294,bushart,2014-09-01 16:39:00,2628,I know guys that lay checkerplate aluminum---clean easy and they love it---lighter
870297,Sinker,2014-09-01 16:47:00,8692,"No reason at all..go for it! Just make sure its strong enough, or you add extra support....i know your a big dude!  S."
870299,mike rousseau,2014-09-01 16:50:00,4661,I know people that weld aluminum so I was hoping to add support as well as move seat locations...
870321,Sinker,2014-09-01 18:48:00,8692,Best floor going if you ask me. Cover it in vinyl and your set for a looooong time.  S.
870324,steelhunter,2014-09-01 19:39:00,81,Where would you get it thick enough to use I need to do mine as well
870343,SlowPoke,2014-09-01 21:25:00,2984,"It's much more expensive and won't be lighter than marine plywood. I used 3/16"" plate and 1/4"" angle for support. I just happen to be fishing with the guy that bought my old boat this weekend and the vinyl clad aluminium is 100% while the 3/4"" marine plywood for the casting deck is already deteriorating under the seat post mount after 6 years. If you plan on keeping the boat, go for it. Be prepared to support the plate because is will flex underfoot without adequate support."

870417,aplumma,2014-09-02 11:08:00,6896,A third thought is it will get hot in the sun. I removed a aluminum deck on the jetdrive and replaced it with wood and my feet are much happier.   Art
870554,mike rousseau,2014-09-03 05:06:00,4661,Think I'm gunna stick with wood...  I've got a garage lined up already for winter... Gunna limp till then...  That'll give me time to get carpet and other supplies  on sale maybe...  Another question tho... Rivets or screw down the floor...? Currently it's got rivets... It is an older aluminum boat that gets banged around in rough water enough so I was worried about screws coming loose... Not sure if lock tight would hold with all the banging...
870584,mpt,2014-09-03 16:34:00,158,"Paint the wood with mistake paint from your local big box supply store. 1 quart will do 2 4x8 sheets. Cover with carpet or http://www.defender.com/product3.jsp?path=-1|2276179|2276198|2276202&id=23708, lasts a long time."
870588,Sinker,2014-09-03 17:38:00,8692,"Do wood with vinyl. Scrap the carpet idea.  I screwed my floor in with stainless screws and they haven't budged. They are much easier to install than the rivets, just make sure you don't screw them down too tight or they break off.  S."
870600,tb4me,2014-09-03 21:41:00,3295,"Hey Mike, im in the same boat..lol pun intended. Cant wait till after Walleye closes to tear into my boat.."
870609,DRIFTER_016,2014-09-03 22:35:00,10439,"​My boat came from the manufacturer with all aluminium flooring. ​Way better than wood by far. All of the sub structure in my boat is also aluminium. Decking is .125"" (1/8"") and carpet covered in my boat. A lot of the West coast boats use aluminium checker plate decking with no covering."
