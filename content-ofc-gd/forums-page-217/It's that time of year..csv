I took a couple of buddies that were visiting Yellowknife to give me a hand and to put them on some fish hopefully. We got there around 10 AM and walked up to the camp to find that a bear went all Benihana on my tent. It shredded the fly and tent it's self to the point it's now going on the bonfire this winter. There was one hole that was bear sized and I guess he was inside the tent at some point. He didn't bother to mess with my sleeping foamy or the 2 plastic storage tubs holding supplies and sleeping bags etc. FYI there was absolutely no smelly stuff at all. Just TP, pillows and sleeping bag.  I don't know why it didn't go in my screen tent with the cooking tote and BBQ in it.  OH well, guess I'll toss up a quick and dirty sleeping cabin in the spring to sleep in and I'll be bringing the boom stick when I sleep there. This was the third bear issue here this summer. Last time I was up my neighbour put a big hole in a large bear and the time before I had one wandering around my property while I was cooking breakfast on Sunday morning. Time to get a bear tag.  My one visitor was Hugo up visiting from South Africa. Today he caught his first pike.    He also got his second, third and fourth."

870404,solopaddler,2014-09-02 02:48:00,8605,Aren't you supposed to be on your way to AK?
870475,DRIFTER_016,2014-09-02 19:18:00,10439,Saturday morning Mike. Won't be back until after thanksgiving.
870478,solopaddler,2014-09-02 19:48:00,8605,Awesome! Hopefully you don't get sick again this time.
870479,DRIFTER_016,2014-09-02 19:57:00,10439,Didn't get sick last time but they had 2 feet of rain in 2 weeks and closed the entire river to boats for a week. Still caught tons of fish though. As a bonus we were the only boat on the upper river the day it opened.
870483,solopaddler,2014-09-02 20:14:00,8605,Weird I have this recollection of you being sick for months after you got back from AK. Hopefully there's no repeat of the biblical rains.
870487,DRIFTER_016,2014-09-02 20:41:00,10439,Got the H1N1 Flu one year while I was there.
