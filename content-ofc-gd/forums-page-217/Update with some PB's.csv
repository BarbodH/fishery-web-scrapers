I've been able to get out fishing quite a bit and on July 25th I witnessed the birth of our first child, Henry.  He's doing very well, growing nicely and will be picking up a fishing rod to join dad in no time!  Last week I was able to get out with Graham Johnston, the owner of Imperium Baits and we did some fishing up in Muskoka, what a blast, I've added a video at the bottom from that day.  Thanks for viewing.                  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZyH4W5rBBI&feature=youtu.be "
