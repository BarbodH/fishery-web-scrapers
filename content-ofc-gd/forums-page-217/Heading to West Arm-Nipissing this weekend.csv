869536,lew,2014-08-26 18:49:00,12766,"  Can you guys post here some images of lures/bites you are using. I google what you all write but google results are so different and diverse I cannot figure out what exactly I need to buy.  Pike are insane and will hit just about anything you put in front of them and they don't care how big or small it is. This little fool tried to inhale a musky bait that was darned near as big as he was. There's hardly a day goes by on the West Arm that I don't get 1/2 a dozen dink pike on big musky baits  And if you can figure out the location of that flat rock in the distance behind me, there's often a  big musky or 2 just out in front of it...the rest is up to you  "
869542,doubleheader,2014-08-26 19:30:00,497,"There is a weedbed across from Lakair that has given up many a pike as well as one just west of the old Samoset lodge. Often you can catch walleye in both as well. Throw a small weedless Johnson spoon and hold on for pike. Walleye can be caught in the weeds on a jig and plastic or crawler. Between the islands west of Lakair leading into Warren Bay can be excellent for walleye, especially when the current is moving. Warren Bay itself is quite deep, so you'll fish the shorelines. Pike and walleye can be anyplace there are weeds. There are some underwater shoals around the periphery of Warren Bay. Do not rely on any map being completely accurate. Slow down, if you have a kicker don't lock it down. Going east under 64 bridge again can be good for walleye due to current. Watch for underwater shoal just SW of bridge like 25'.   I recently came back from 2 weeks (8/9-8/23) and did rather well for walleye in 20-25 FOW. My wife and I caught close to 60 walleye which given the conditions wasn't bad. Of those 11 were legal, over 18.2"". Our biggest was 25"", smaller than we normally get, but again conditions were bad. Water temp dropped 5 degrees in the 1st week.  Most all our fishing was east of 64 bridge around Squaw Island. Fish were located near underwater shoals and humps but not on them.  As was mentioned Porcupine Creek has been producing, we didn't even fish it. We prefer to pull harnesses using our bow mount."
869633,AdamS,2014-08-27 01:51:00,161,Experiment with different spinnerbaits. We caught a bunch of pike on a variety of colours while we were up there. For bass we had luck with crank baits and the occasional pike would hit them too. Also try jerk baits if your into that.  I'm +1 for a guide out there. The first day we were out we caught a few fish but the following day with the guide we caught a lot and he wasn't that expensive either. Good Luck!
870009,erexa,2014-08-29 17:27:00,13,"Second day here. Scanned the whole west arm, cannot catch a single fish here. Tried jiggs, cranks, spinning etc everything that I had. Does not work at all. Called the lodge cannot get hold of guides (("

I'll tell you what I'm catching fish on!  (I'll give you some hints already, white grubs, black grubs, and white Colorado blade spinner baits)"
870016,lew,2014-08-29 20:14:00,12766,"I'll be up there Sunday, at Memquisite for my first stay there!  It's an excellent place and you'll really enjoy it."
870020,Andy,2014-08-29 21:13:00,330,"Now now, settle down. If you've done any fishing at all, you have had days like that before. If you haven't had days like that, you either haven't fished much, or you are a world class pro. It takes time to learn a body of water. I have hundreds of spots marked on my GPS, and it's taken a lot of fishless days and many thousands of dollars to find them. If the only enjoyment you get out of fishing is catching fish, you might need a new hobby. Find one of the bays or long fingers around Warren Bay  and keep chucking away at the shoreline, laydowns and weeds with spinnerbaits, spinners or shallow cranks. Then move to the next one. Sooner or later a pike or bass will take your bait. Relax and enjoy your time on the water."
870026,Gallie,2014-08-29 21:37:00,1215,This sounds like some sage advice any angler could adhere to. Id listen to it. Good luck out there!
870056,Old Ironmaker,2014-08-30 07:26:00,8243,"All I can add is for your Walleye jigs add a stinger.  I don't think anyone can say "" use this brand of lure with this colour and you will catch fish"". It really doesn't work that way, it takes many hours and many dollars in tackle to zone in on a species.  And if the West Arm is anywhere close to like it is west of Callander Bay for rocks hidden just below the water. Do not, I repeat do not go out at night fishing there unless you know that water inside and out. Even then there is no such person that is an expert at not hitting a rock(s) and or ending up on a shoal with a foot of water covering it on Nip. I spent one very, very cold night just west of Bear Creek in a boat in May hung up on a large shoal. We had to wait until someone saw us in the morning. When daybreak came I was about 2 miles from where I thought I was, that was the 10th year fishing regularly there. And I took the bottom end of the outboard out to boot. We were going at trolling speed when we bottomed out thankfully. No way we were able to get that wooden Geisler off that shoal, no way.  Be careful man and good fishing."
870057,Bass Tard,2014-08-30 07:35:00,128,"Good advice here, guys!  I've been in the exact same situation, and it can be very scary!"

Heading out again now for walters"
870349,Dan668,2014-09-01 22:12:00,1120,It was ok for us.  Besides losing a prop and skeg lol.  No muskies to be seen.  Could not keep the pike off the line.  Two largies over 6lbs. A few small walters.  Thought we did ok for our first time in the area.  Too much water to cover.
869367,erexa,2014-08-26 00:40:00,13,"Heading West Arm/Nipissing this weekend  Will be staying at friends private cottage around Lakair Lodge area.  I know there is Walleye and Pike/Muskie in the area as well as some bass.  I am newbie, please suggest what lures/bites (if any) to use and where exactly to fish for Walleye? Not a big fun of muskie, but might fish for pike as well.  It's just not sure what type of lures, tackle are used for Bass, Walleye and Pickerel, what are the best times to fish for them etc. I always used worms and it seems to me worms attract lot of sunfish/panfish which I hate and other bigger fish never get onto my hook. So please can somebody answer my questions and preferably with some pictures of suggested lures, hooks, etc  1. What kind of bites/lures, etc are best for walleye, pike and bass (one two per each would be good enough)? Please give me some picture examples if possible. 2. From my experience walleye is fished at night and bass generally in the morning. Correct me if I am wrong and give me couple of more suggestions if possible. 3. If we need to fish at night other than a solid flashlight any special equipment required for that? We will be at night on the open lake so maybe some other stuff required/useful in these conditions  And in general whatever else you find you can suggest that I might find useful  Thanks a lot in advance."

869403,BillsTheBassMan,2014-08-26 03:42:00,932,"If you're in it for sport fish bass/pike, not many guys do and traditional bass tackle will work at all times of the day on traditional spots.  If you're in it for food I'm the wrong guy.  I haven't kept a fish in over 10 years."

We will be at night on the open lake so maybe some other stuff required/useful in these conditions  If your unfamiliar with those waters and your fishing at night without your friend, be very careful as some areas have lots of hidden surprises just below the waters surface that can put a real serious damper on your fun."
869426,Andy,2014-08-26 11:49:00,330,"I'm with Lew on this one, unless u are fishing just off of the dock. Sounds like u will have your hands full trying  out  different lures for different species. I have gone up there for years and I still don't go out at night. Lots of unmarked rocks, and if you find yourself too far away without a GPS, you'll get lost and it will get pretty lonely out there. All the islands will look the same at night."
869432,erexa,2014-08-26 12:19:00,13,lew and Andy thanks for the suggestions. We have a fully equipped fishing boat (including marine GPS). And we will be at least 2 (most likely 3 people on the boat) so should not have any surprises here concerning hands are full can't pay attention on where the boat is heading to.  But still guys can somebody tell me which lures are generally good for walleye/pike/bass ?

It's not what you can see that you need to be concerned about, it's what you can't see....Many of us have ""found"" rocks and shoals that ""were not there"" last year... Google is your friend....."
869437,Fish4Eyes,2014-08-26 12:37:00,1022,"I can provide some help on the walleye. White, pink and orange jigs (in order of my preference) tipped with worms has worked for me, as well as lindy rigs. I also had luck adding the same colour twister tail as the jig and tipped with worm. The key is to keep the bait moving. I like to put my trolling motor down and crawl along as slow as possible. Focus on depths in the 17-25' range and move shallower as night approaches. On bright sunny days in the afternoon, look for areas where trees cast a shadow in 25-30'. Fish all the narrows in that area, they all hold a variety of fish. If you are catching perch, it is usually a good sign that walleye may be around. If your catching rock bass, move on as there will be no walleye around. To get your hopes up, a co-workers father owns a place on the West Arm and says walleye fishing has been pretty good as of late. Good luck!  As for night fishing, be very careful if you dont know the area as others have said. I got spun around once at night in Warren Bay and had no idea where I was. Thankfully, I knew that there was a bridge near Lakair, so I waited for a vehicle to pass over so I know where I need to go. I would recommend you stay near the bridge at night for this reason. You may want to hang out there anyway at night . Just watch out for the big rock on approach to the bridge (Lakair side of the bridge). It is usually marked with a bleach bottle."
869438,lew,2014-08-26 12:40:00,12766,"Many of us have ""found"" rocks and shoals that ""were not there"" last year...   You've got that right John, do you remember 3 years ago when I parked my boat right on top of a rock, in the EXACT spot the GPS said was 8' deep and no rocks anywhere in the area.  Sometimes your GPS is just a fancy hood ornament."

869442,DanD,2014-08-26 12:59:00,2223,"I'm with pikeslayer, hire a guide for a half or full day. I thought I could read structure and find fish on my own on the West Arm. I did OK; but after becoming friends with one of the guides at the lodge; I went out with him on his day off. Man did he do some schooling; he took me to places where we just boated past and never gave a second glance. You will learn so much from them that it would take you years to figure out on your own. Nobody likes the idea of spending extra money; but a guide in unfamiliar waters is well worth it. Hit up some of the lodges in the area or possibly some of the people here can give a line on a good guide?  Dan."

869473,erexa,2014-08-26 14:16:00,13,The closest to our cottage is Lakair Lodge. Do they have guides there? Here is where we staying  http://postimg.org/image/rqc7ty4nt/
869477,lew,2014-08-26 14:29:00,12766,Not sure exactly which cottage your staying at John but I go thru that channel all the time and would certainly know the place if there was a picture.  Lakair Lodge is now out of business...sadly.  Memquisit Lodge is about 3 miles east of there on the north shore or you can go 2 miles up #64 and you'll see their road on your right and just go down there 2 1/2 miles.
869478,Raycaster,2014-08-26 14:30:00,528,"Getting a guide for the day was the best thing we ever did on Nipissing.  We spent the first 2 hours on Cache Bay snagging and tangling like 5 year olds. We hated the weeds but by noon we were ripping every lure through the soup like champs. Think we ended the day over 15 pike and a much learned appreciation for REALLY fishing with a smart plan and a better understanding of lake. I now head to the thickest cover I can find whatever lake I'm on.  I know everyone says ""not me"" but I 10X agree with the above posters about the rocks there! I swear we were in the middle of the lake in deep water when we took out a prop. Another time we were skating between islands and ended up on slate top in 1' of water bottomed out! We were very careful, had maps, and were warned several times. When locals each have 2 sets of extra props in their boat you should be very weary..."
869480,woodenboater,2014-08-26 14:44:00,2277,I've always liked Crankin Raps for pike and walleye (and white spinner baits). Know people who love burning spinner baits over vegetation for pike.
869483,erexa,2014-08-26 15:07:00,13,As I said because we are very close to where Lakair was (Look at the red cross on the map) we will most likely fish not in the main lake but in Warren Bay.  BTW is water good enough for kids for swimming for our kids or it will be too cold at this time of the year (it's a big lake it might be cold overall)?
869490,DanD,2014-08-26 15:14:00,2223,If your kids are anything like mine were when they were younger; they don't care if it's a cold swim as long as they're having fun. That being said I remember one time up there I had to pull my son and is buddy out of the water. Their lips were blue and they still called me a spoil sport making them come out for a bit. LOL  Dan.
