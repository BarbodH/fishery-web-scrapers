870087,misfish,2014-08-30 18:09:00,29133,"These weather reports are getting so bogus these days. High winds from the south by 9 am were called for.. Not really a concern here, as the south shore will be protected. Plan was, if to bad to hit the lake,then fly fishing the streams was the plan.  Up at 4 am, the front tree is dancing. Hmmmm. I had told terry I would txt him when I get to the water and see whats up in the morning. Can you say,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, Never mind. The bay was glass. High winds on the hill,and not a breath down on the bay. So txt him,  lets fish. Back and forth we go. Boat or toons? I said lets boat. Winds may pick up later.  We head out and hit one of my favorite bass spots on the bay.(Where I got my first PB 6lb) The last few years, it has not really been that good. Not sure why. it looks just like it has for 15 years. Sand patches,weeds,nice drop off. And it is still not that good. One fish and one missed by boat side that Terry swears, was a 8+ pounder. The look on his face I have to believe him. Quickly throw tubes around to see if it would hit,but to no avil. So we head to try some down riggn..   Lets say there were words used that cannot be shared here on this family site. When you see the depth finder shots,and say to yourselves,you guys caught no fish out there? NO WAY. Oh ya,no way dudes. UNREAL.  Pics from this days fishing.             A clean fat nickle.       OOPS me bad.     That,s not the pic ^^^^^^^^^^^^ I was  talking about,but it was funny at the time.  These are.. A little dark,but it was when we were out there. Im sure he,ll be able to lighten them up..    .I really like this one. Sun rise in the back ground was awesome.       "

870102,davey buoy,2014-08-30 21:27:00,5505,"Crazy morning here as well,hit the back side of the islands by 6:30,couple hits,couple rockies,couple perch.Not much showing till we got into the 30' depth.Wind brutal,couldn't keep a line straight.
