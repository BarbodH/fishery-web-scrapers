According to Barrie police, the male driver pulled into the lot at the Tiffin Boat Launch shortly after noon and parked the truck facing the water. At that time, police say a person needed to use the launch and when the tow-truck driver went to move his vehicle, there was a malfunction which prevented it from getting into gear. Police say the driver was familiar with this issue and crawled under the truck to rectify the problem. The truck's transmission kicked in at this point, according to police, and it began moving down the launch into the lake, running over the driver. A female passenger in the truck was rescued by someone waiting to use the ramp. Emergency crews responded and the truck driver was taken to Royal Victoria Regional Health Centre with non-life-threatening injuries. His passenger was treated at the scene. Both the Ministry of Labour and Ministry of the Environment have been contacted regarding an investigation. Police say the truck came to rest in approximately 10 feet of water off shore. In the early evening, crews were still on scene trying to salvage the vehicle."
