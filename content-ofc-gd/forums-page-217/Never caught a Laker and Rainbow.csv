870367,LostAnotherOne,2014-09-02 00:38:00,956,"Hi guys.  Just need a little advice on how to catch my first Laker and Rainbow.  I have caught almost every species except these two so I was hoping this fall I can cross them both off my list.  I'm looking for a place no longer then a 30 minute drive from Hamilton, when they cruise in, and what to use.  Please and thanks"

Can bronte creek produce rainbows or what about Burlington pier or Bronte pier.  I heard  theres lakers at fifty point"
870387,BillM,2014-09-02 01:36:00,17367,"I don't know how much of a laker run Bronte gets, but you'll be wanting to hit the piers with some hardware in the near future.  When someone is talking about 50 Point and lakers, they are most likely talking about fishing out in the lake (ie in a boat)"
