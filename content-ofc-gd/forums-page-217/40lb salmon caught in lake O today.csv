485772,Fang,2010-07-16 14:55:00,1330,46.38 with the new harmonized tax equals 52.41 lbs  we win!!!
485783,Billy Bob,2010-07-16 15:53:00,5865, Now wait a minute.....when Albany finally passes a new state budget we might trump that amount in spades...
485838,chessy,2010-07-16 20:06:00,610, you forgot the eco tax and with that much pcbs and other contamanats in that fish you sure can't recycle it
485847,bigugli,2010-07-16 20:32:00,6138,Only if you keep McGuinty down there with you.
485870,Billy Bob,2010-07-16 21:52:00,5865, Believe me...with this present administration we don't have room for him.
486000,SlowPoke,2010-07-17 06:30:00,2984," Yup, TonyB won last year and Percher the year before that. Let's keep the winning streak alive!"
486254,torco,2010-07-18 16:40:00,656,I am so excited to have a charter booked for mid august this year. With all the great reports its look like its going to be another great year for salmon on the Lake.
486271,siwash,2010-07-18 18:53:00,683,"  I don't mean to burst you bubble, but the problem with salmon fishing (more than any other type of fishing) is that it can completely change in a matter of hours, let alone days.. they are nomadic creatures and unpredictable. Unlike a walleye or musky, or bass, where you can be pretty certain they're gonna be within a general area (feeding on a shoal in the eve, dropping back to nearby deeper water at mid-day, etc...)  salmon might be off the shores of toronto Islands at this moment and in 12 hours they might be frolicking off the shores of Rochester  My advice is, don't get your hopes up too high and if you catch something that day, great... but the dedicated salmon guys have plenty of fruitless days, even in a ""good year"".. those guys who post pictures of big fat salmon go out regularly"
486276,fishinguypat,2010-07-18 19:05:00,547, bubble bursted?
486282,siwash,2010-07-18 19:20:00,683,  As in don't get to excited or get your hopes up too high...  It's an English idiom.
486295,The Urban Fisherman,2010-07-18 20:06:00,2050,Dude! Did I miss something or is there a picture of that beast anywhere? I keep checking back but all I can see is that 32 lber
486351,torco,2010-07-19 01:00:00,656,"My bubble is not burst. Grew up fishing for salmon every summer with my uncle on Lake Huron and Michigan. Have also gone on Lake Ontario charters and caught 1 fish and 20 fish, I understand how they cycle around the lake and can be gone in a flash. But you have to admit from looking at the size of last years fish in the derby and the size already caught this year, the chances of getting a larger fish appear to be looking up."
486389,siwash,2010-07-19 03:12:00,683,No pictures yet.. there was another near 40lb caught today!  39.9  what a year it's been so far!!!
486458,bdox,2010-07-19 13:42:00,329,
870052,pyro,2014-08-30 02:54:00,16,Nice fish I got a 23.6 salmon and 18 lake trout this year on my new boat
870054,NANUK,2014-08-30 04:40:00,797,Nice fish I got a 23.6 salmon and 18 lake trout this year on my new boat  Why dig up a 4 year old thread to post your current fishing report ?
870083,creditmaster,2014-08-30 17:58:00,190,thats a killer salmon ............ but  nothing compares to fly fishing for salmon in newfoundland!!!!!
870090,moxie,2014-08-30 18:43:00,1566,Nice to see.
870096,Terry,2014-08-30 19:38:00,14456, Why dig up a 4 year old thread to post your current fishing report ? AMEN
870104,BillM,2014-08-30 21:34:00,17367,ZALMONS!!!!!
485655,siwash,2010-07-16 01:00:00,683,Biggest fish from that derby in years.. been a great year  http://www.greatontariosalmonderby.ca/updates/
485657,BillsTheBassMan,2010-07-16 01:04:00,932,Whoa . . . I knew it was just a matter of time this season after talking to all my salmon buddies and seeing all the reports.  What a beast.
485659,asdve23rveavwa,2010-07-16 01:13:00,2690,Whoop there it is!!!
485662,Paully,2010-07-16 01:20:00,712,40 lbs is massive.. Imagine gettin one of them throwin a cleo of the peir!  I remember a OFC member won one of the weeks last year?...yes?
485671,Grimace,2010-07-16 01:34:00,2020,Awesome.  I say week 5 wins it with a 45.  A 40 in week 1 is just wicked.  It would be so cool if Lake O spit out a 50 but I think that is stretching it.
485674,Sinker,2010-07-16 01:36:00,8692,"It must have been feeding on the fleas  I figured there would be fish 40+ this year, but not in week one.  S."
485676,siwash,2010-07-16 01:39:00,683,I'm gonna catch the 50 lb
485688,eyefish,2010-07-16 02:30:00,135,keep in mind all that way back when i used to fish for salmon out there I'm going back 15-20 yrs ago there was talk of the 50 pound mark being broke all the time...its good to see that the big-uns are coming back
485690,asdve23rveavwa,2010-07-16 02:41:00,2690,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but, don't think any of them were ever confirmed...wasn't the official ""biggie"" around 47 or 48 lbs?"
485691,siwash,2010-07-16 02:42:00,683,47  but a 48 or 49 was caught in ny
485692,siwash,2010-07-16 02:43:00,683,there's a 50 out there
485694,BillM,2010-07-16 02:48:00,17367," When I was a kid, the winning fish of the Toronto Star Great Salmon hunt was always over 40lbs...  No doubt there was a 50lb'r swimming in the lake at that time.  I wouldn't doubt it if there is a 50 out there now.. These fish are huge and it's only the start of July!"
485722,eyefish,2010-07-16 08:29:00,135,47 and change I believe
485723,Billy Bob,2010-07-16 09:50:00,5865,NYS Chinook Salmon record is 47 lb. 13 oz.
485725,siwash,2010-07-16 10:26:00,683,there have been unconfirmed reports of fish exceeding 50 but the anglers didn't have scales and released the fish... i saw a pcture of one of these fish once and it was huge but.... take that for what it's worth!
485726,Roy,2010-07-16 10:36:00,13728,Ontario record is 46.38 lbs.
485727,Billy Bob,2010-07-16 10:48:00,5865, So we kicked your ass.....I think the lake should be changed to Lake New York...
485738,Fisherman,2010-07-16 11:24:00,7201, You better watch your tongue or we'll come and burn down part of the White House again
485742,Billy Bob,2010-07-16 11:38:00,5865, Only if I can help...
485745,asdve23rveavwa,2010-07-16 12:12:00,2690, Could be worse you could be getting taxed to death like us up here in Ontario!
485753,BillM,2010-07-16 13:21:00,17367,"I thank NYS for their stocking efforts, because if it wasn't for them Lake O wouldn't be in the great shape that it is."
485754,asdve23rveavwa,2010-07-16 13:27:00,2690,I'll second that statement!!!
485759,Billy Bob,2010-07-16 14:00:00,5865, But we're working on it....  :wallbash:
485760,Billy Bob,2010-07-16 14:01:00,5865, You're welcome my Canadian Friend....ENJOY and leave a couple for me to smoke...
485770,BillM,2010-07-16 14:41:00,17367, Will do!
