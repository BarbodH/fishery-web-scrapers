869190,cheaptackle,2014-08-25 10:26:00,849,I'd invest a couple hundred bucks in talking to a lawyer or accountant who specializes in real estate and taxes - you may very well be on to something if you can swing it financially and physically.  Not that much different from owning a main residence and a cottage but there may be both an income (tourism rental) and tax (write offs) advantage if you play the system correctly.  Good luck!

869195,woodenboater,2014-08-25 11:30:00,2277,I'd grab that like quick !
869201,Rod Caster,2014-08-25 12:21:00,5784,I was kidding about myself owning it! ThAt would be an insane amount of work to maintain!!  Maybe someone here is looking to move to the country?
869311,cheaptackle,2014-08-25 21:41:00,849,Why be kidding Chad?  It's only an hour from North Bay according to Google Maps - think about it!  Michael

That might be a real bonus! Close but not too close could push that property value through the roof!"

870095,Musky or Specks,2014-08-30 19:17:00,2710,"Chad I wouldn't trade your river for anything, well except maybe a few other brook trout rivers properties."
870097,Rod Caster,2014-08-30 19:40:00,5784,"Chad I wouldn't trade your river for anything, well except maybe a few other brook trout rivers properties. Agreed. Boom creek (the mattawa one) is far less productive than the river through my property.  I need to establish a good walking/atv trail down to the river... rather brutal terrain back there as it stands."
870114,HTHM,2014-08-31 01:47:00,4082,I need to establish a good walking/atv trail down to the river... rather brutal terrain back there as it stands. Who do I know that has connections with local excavating contractors?????
