870162,misfish,2014-08-31 17:04:00,29133,"The wind forecast and chance of rain today, had me thinking twice. Travel or just go and play. Well , I did play. Guess if your fishing and getting a good work out,it,s playing.  .The west wind  was making it a tougher work out then I thought it would be, but I managed just fine.. Traveled a good distance with just flipping and rowing. (told ya all. The electric will have it,s place.)  The toon is  becoming an addiction. I can say this, it has made me feel better about myself. No different then the tube,but I can travel further with the toon.  Two UL rod combos and one tray of tubes was all I was taking this morning. Just that,my flippers and oars.  I did some serious distance this morning, as you can see  by the red line on the map..  The green line is my next trek.  I want to do this run before lakers and whities close,,as I,ll be crossing over some good waters heading from Johnsons beach back to Minets point. Hope it,s calm waters for jigging. If not,well atleast i did what I set out to do.      So,is there something that will give me distance traveled ? (not looking at spending big bux)   BTW,FISHING SUCKED., The water is cooling off fast.  Probly take a few days for the fish to adapt to the temperature  change."
870163,Terry,2014-08-31 17:07:00,14456,any gps should do it  my handheld garmin would work for you
870164,misfish,2014-08-31 17:19:00,29133,any gps should do it  my handheld garmin would work for you  I was thinking something like what the walker/runners use. I just remembered I have a GPS unit some where. Need to get my thinking cap on to where it could be.
870167,BillM,2014-08-31 17:37:00,17367,"GPS is going to be your best bet.   It will keep track of all kinds of things (total distance travel, ETAs, etc)   And in case the fog rolls in and you have no idea where you are, you can get back to shore"
870171,misfish,2014-08-31 17:49:00,29133,"And in case the fog rolls in and you have no idea where you are, you can get back to shore  I,ll just put my nose to the air. If there,s a dog stand near by,I,ll find shore."
870215,FloatnFly,2014-09-01 00:08:00,1640,"going by your drawing there, you traveled approximately 15km, if you move your lines to land references, you can figure out 2 sides of the triangle, by using google maps, you can find the distance, and then its a simple calculation to figure out the 3rd side.  other than that, a gps with marine tracking would make that easier"
870218,Terry,2014-09-01 00:16:00,14456,I think it's more like 3.3 miles
870219,leaf4,2014-09-01 00:22:00,2466,"If you have a smartphone and can have it in a waterproof case, map my ride may work, it was made for biking etc but just goes off the gps, no data"
870247,fishindevil,2014-09-01 07:18:00,6254,Just about any GPS will give you that info and if that's all you want it for won't cost a ton either brian just start a waypoint from where you start & track that's all can't get any easier than that !!! It will give you your distance traveled and speed and if you go over a shoal or anything you can mark waypoints as you go !!!! Just a small handheld and put it in your pocket !!!! Attach a floating small bouy or something to it and you are golden some are waterproof as well but you don't need to spend a ton just a basic GPS will do man !!!! Cheers
870249,misfish,2014-09-01 08:52:00,29133,I think it's more like 3.3 miles   It felt like 15 km. LOL  Found my old Lowrance go gps.
870254,singingdog,2014-09-01 09:58:00,1047,"Familiarise yourself with the ""tracks"" function on your GPS. Before you go out next time, make sure that you clear the current track and reset the trip computer. Once you are done fishing, save the track to review later on. If you post it to a site like Everytrail, it will give you a very clear breakdown of distance and speed."

870316,Bill Shearer,2014-09-01 18:02:00,456,I will second the Map My Tracks app! Should be exactly what you need. Just make sure your case is waterproof or you keep it in a ZipLoc bag. You don't even need to be online!
870318,misfish,2014-09-01 18:10:00,29133,Try the My Tracks app on a smart phone .  Do I have to pay for that?
870319,Terry,2014-09-01 18:12:00,14456,it's free
