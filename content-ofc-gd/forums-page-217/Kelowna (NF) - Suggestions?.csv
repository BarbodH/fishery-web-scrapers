Wife mentioned I should go fishing while we are out there - sure!!!  Anybody fished out in that area?  I will be looking for a charter, as I won't have any of my own equipment - won't have a place to pack it, etc.  We will also be in Vancouver - so may think of Ocean fishing too.  Any suggestions/areas/charters to use would be great.  There August 30th to September 14th.  Thanks again.  Tupelo"
869858,Shloim,2014-08-28 19:21:00,515,"I have a friend who lives there, he's not a fisherman but I can ask if you like? He lives in Vernon 30 min away..."
869860,hutch4113,2014-08-28 19:23:00,374,Sure...that would be great.  Any help would be appreciated.  We are visiting with friends out there - so they may have ideas too.
869865,Sinker,2014-08-28 19:56:00,8692,"IF you've never done it, hit the Fraser River for sturgeon. Its worth it. I know its not Kelowna, but if your going to be in Vancouver, look into it for sure. Its amazing! The only place they measure fish in FEET!!  I went with STS guiding service. They were awesome! Great boats, gear and guides!  Next time I'm out there, I want to do deep sea fishing for halibut and Ling cod! I've done the sturgeon and salmon already.  S."

If you had a choice - Sturgeon Fishing or Salmon?  I know the Salmon are starting to run.  I can probably only do a day - so want to make sure I catch something.  I have always wanted to Sturgeon - just not sure how active it is (but I know it is exciting).  Thanks for the tip - will look them up."
869874,Sinker,2014-08-28 20:37:00,8692,"Id choose the sturgeon, only because I can catch all the salmon I want here in ON."
869920,leaf4,2014-08-29 00:44:00,2466,"I would definitely do sturgeon over salmon, and from past reports given with guides that's the best way to get setup and on fish"
869938,Sinker,2014-08-29 02:50:00,8692,"Yep, when I did thhe sturgeon trip, we caught a dozen or so fish. A lot of them were under 4', but several were over 5, biggest around 8. It was a blast. When you see a 6ft fish go airborne, your heart stops for a second!! Its awesome!  S."
869947,Whalebreath,2014-08-29 05:22:00,15,"For the Fraser your timing couldn't be better-with the right guiding outfit you can do Salmon in the morning & Sturgeon in the afternoon-fresh Salmon Roe is the best bait out there.  If you hit stable barometric conditions the Sturgeon fishery can be unreal but again you need the right guide Fraser Rivers guides have a well deserved reputation for not working too terribly hard many specialise in long boat rides and taking extra time to photograph small fish.  I have seen one outfit who I will not name take a full 90 minutes to monkey around dragging a mid sized fish across the whole river, slowly take pics, take a walk on the beach, splash some water around the deck and the slowwwwwwwly make it's way back to the original anchorage all the while my partner & I were nailing fish between 4' & 6' left right & centre and releasing them after brief violent fights.  If you want a recommendation shoot me an email [emailÂ protected]  For the Kelowna area you timing couldn't be worse there is some decent Trout action but by fall water is warm and levels low action almost nonexistent except for a brief early morning bite."
