Does anyone know of any other Canadian lure parts place where you might be able to get those minnow bodies?  I am looking at trying to make up some replacements for the original rapala floater minnow before I end up snagging up the last one in my box, maybe even dabble in making a few other lures as well, but I got lots to use up before I would need any others at the moment...lol."
