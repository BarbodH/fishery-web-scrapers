Back in '99 I bought a new Crestliner and the capacity plate said it was rated for 50 HP in Canada and 90 HP in the States.  I called CCG and they said Canada didn't think the boat should be rated for 90 HP even though it was designed in the States to carry that much HP"
870432,BillM,2014-09-02 13:57:00,17367,Kinda like our crash standards as well.  km/h vs mph.  Although now I think they've aligned those for both countries.

I still think that is a very rough deal, the want you to fight it for the overtime.  Funny story, I was out at OFC event for the pike tourney.  OPP came to check my boat in the little sea-doo we had 4 people on my boat. OPP does the life jacket check and tells me I need 5 life jackets and starts writing the ticket.  My family is completely confused and I start explaining we only need 4 life jackets as he continues to write the ticket looking down.  Finally he looks up in disgust and explains 5 people needs 5 life jackets. In a heart beat he realised he only see's 4 people starring down at him and was counting the front casting seat thinking someone was sitting there.  My cousin in very quick wit said to the OPP officer sir have you been drinking.  Ahhh good times"

He was not fined for not complying by having ""legal"" PFDs onboard, but rather the fact he wore a non compliant one?

I don't know the legislation but am guessing that carrying ""legal"" ones is one thing but actually wearing a non compliant one must be an offence?  If it is not an offence to wear/carry non compliant ones so long as a ""legal"" one is aboard, he broke no laws. It is easy to say......but he should fight it.  But its not my time and expense to do so, so it's easy to say that.  Better judgement on behalf of the officer would have saved everyone a lot of misery here."

Weren't casinos supposed to be helping to pay for our medicare at one point. Go to any casino at the end of the month and just look at all the cars lined up in the handycap spaces.

On the rock(s).  http://www.nugget.ca/2014/08/26/something-doesnt-belong   Shannon Unger was enjoying a bonfire Sunday night with a couple of friends at her Lake Nipissing home when she heard a boat speeding past her home. Hearing the sounds of motors zipping by is part of life when you live on the lake. But this was a little different. “It was dark, around 9 p.m., and we heard this boat pass by our shore and my husband commented that it seemed pretty close to one of the islands out front,” Unger told The Nugget Tuesday. “Less than 30 seconds after he commented we heard a massive noise. Scraping and smashing,” she said. “We all stopped. We looked at each other and said 'holy crap. Something awful has happened.'” Unger said at that point her husband and family friend jumped on the wave runner in the dark to try and find the boat in the water and assist those on board should they need help. “We couldn't find anything,” she said. “But it didn't occur to us or to anyone to look up at the islands. Who would have thought it was up on an island.” Unger said the next day they went back out and saw the boat teetering on an island on Lake Nipissing just off the shores around Rocky Shore Drive on the southshore. As of Tuesday afternoon the boat was still up on the rocks."

Inflatable PFDs MUST be worn (not just easily accessible) to count as a requisite PFD.

That being said I never wear a life jacket, unless crossing big water, and the moment I start fishing it comes off. But to fine a guy for having a tear in his jacket, when he has other jackets in the boat ? That's dirty! At least the guy took the initiative to put one on ( maybe he didn't notice a small tear in the back, I know some jackets can tear quite easily, and it easy to miss a tear that's not the length of the entire jacket) and then fine the guy? I have one question, you go into the water and are in bad shape, would you rather have A) No life jacket or  A life jacket with a tear in it. I think I may choose option B. So if the guy wasn't wearing a jacket at all he wouldn't have gotten a fine? It just doesn't make sense. If that's the case then they should fine everyone driving around with no life jacket on, cause I'm not sure, but I think it maybe safer driving around with a jacket with a small tear vs not wearing a jacket at all. I would have taken the fine but a piece of my mind would have been given, clearly a money grab. That cop should feel shame, a good warning a telling him to switch to one of the other jackets would have been the right thing to do imo."

The only people they may have been endangering were themselves, and it wasn't like they were flaunting the law, after all they were wearing jackets and had two spares. $240.00 is a huge some for some folks. I think that maybe a better outcome would have been a warning with an opportunity to get a compliant jacket. What I thought was really condescending was how the senior OPP kept call the offender ""buddy"" as he was lecturing him. I heard him say it multiple times, and they were too intimidated to tell him where to stick his ""buddy"".  On another note, however, long after the OPP had gone home for dinner, another boatload of people left the dock for a camping trip. They were extremely overloaded, even if all the gear were removed thety were overloaded with people, and it was obviously an unsafe situation. That father who intentionally put his family at risk so as to avoid an extra trip should have been caught and a heavy fine levied."

As for the over-loaded boat, I saw them leave the dock too and thought the same as you, that was very dangerous and the guy in charge put everyone else at risk. It was either 6 or 7 people in that 14' tinny including a couple small children with nobody wearing a life jacket, a large Golden Retriever and all their camping gear and there was only about 6"" of freeboard when they went out.

That's gotta be a boring job after awhile. Then you finally get the opportunity to get trained and join the marine unit and get to go boating for your shift instead of doing the cruiser thing that sucks cause its so boring. At the end of your marine shift your sgt says what did you do today and you tell him you emptied a couple of ticket books and a big smile appears on his face and he says we gotta put you on marine duty more often. If I was a cop and had the choice of hiway patrol or marine duty I know what one I would want to do. Our province is so broke and the easiest way to generate cash is by handing out tickets.

Yes, it would be relevant for any common sense application of the law, a quality that these a'holes seem to be sorely lacking!  It's a real shame that this garbage happens. The proper functioning of our society depends on most people having a respect for the law and its officers. This crap erodes that respect."
869499,GRINGO LOCO,2014-08-26 15:57:00,20,I think they should shoot him with xxxx and then shoot him for stinking!
869332,lew,2014-08-25 22:54:00,12766,"Hi guys, I was up at a  Nippissing lodge the last 2 weeks and a couple incidents with some other guests and the OPP marine unit had me wondering if they could have been handled differently.  1st was a man and his mother out for a boat ride.  They had all the required safety gear and both were wearing life jackets and had another 2 spare jackets in the boat.  The OPP  stopped them for the usual check and everything in the boat was OK except the life jacket the man was wearing had a tear in the back. The cop told him that was illegal and gave him a ticket for $240.  The jacket the mother was wearing was OK as were the 2 spares but the cop didn't care and told him he could fight it in Sudbury court if he wanted.  2nd incident involved another family and the same cop a couple days later.   The child had a medical check-up the previous week and weighted 48 pounds but they didn't tell the cop as they just wanted to get away from him.  In my opinion, $240 is alot of money considering everybody was wearing life jackets in both boats and everything else was perfect and I think a warning would have been sufficient in both cases and just tell them to both  correct the problem before coming out in the boat again.  Am I right or wrong with my thinking ??"
869334,Joeytier,2014-08-25 22:59:00,3990,"Oh boy, that's brutal!!"
869336,davey buoy,2014-08-25 23:00:00,5505,"I agree Lew,look like he was splitting hairs.Most likely trying to reach his quota?"
869337,Fisherman,2014-08-25 23:04:00,7201,Some are real nit pickers and some are real nitwits.  A warning would have sufficed at the very most.
869338,misfish,2014-08-25 23:04:00,29133,"Seems like a jack    to me Lew. Then again,maybe he,s been involved in some bad mishaps and takes the law to the serious point. PFD,s save lives.  As for the torn jacket,he is right, BUT, come on..They had extras. Then again,then had extras and should of known better?"
869340,bigugli,2014-08-25 23:06:00,6138,"Right now, just about every ministry in Ontario is on a ticket blitz.   Must be trying to find additional funds for the Wynne Wishlist, or the $20 billion transit plan. There have been 4 different provincial agencies blitzing the St Jakobs market this past month."
869342,leaf4,2014-08-25 23:20:00,2466,"what a d!ck! that's seriously messed up. how can you issue a ticket on a child because he doesn't look 50lbs I would understand if it was clearly 20lbs or in that area but come on, and against tourists to boot, way to ruin their vaca and good luck having them come back and spend more tourist dollars here."
869343,outllaw,2014-08-25 23:22:00,1232,"lew. the opp used there gestapo procedures here in l.s.clair. they made the news weekly. even the Windsor star ran an article. as cops say ..same m.o. . down here we swear they take folks to anal school train them that way. sorry if this offends folks but I have seen lots on the water,some of it pretty sketchy. those tourist have been slammed. . if the moderaters delete this I understand,but from the perspective you get more flies with honey not vinegar."
869344,kickingfrog,2014-08-25 23:23:00,8333,"On the face of it, it sure sounds like they are giving tickets and not expecting someone to come back and fight it.   In the first case if either of the other 2 lifejackets were ""legal""then the ticket is completely bogus.  In the second case I guess the ticket is technically legit but without a scale how does the officer know that the kids is 48lb instead of 50?   It's one thing if people are legitimately putting themselves or others in danger, or are egregiously contrary to the law, but this sure sounds like someone emptying a ticket book."
869345,grt1,2014-08-25 23:30:00,638,I heard a news item the other day on the radio where a group of 4 were charged by the officers on a fly in lake because they weren't wearing their pfds. I asked the officers in our detachment and they told me the life jackets had to be in the boat but it didn't matter if they were worn or not. the only exception to this is if they are the inflatable then they have to be worn at all times. now I see there was an ad on tv sponsored by the opp where they say the law has changed and the inflatable must be within an arms length of the person who is supposed to be wearing it.  this all sounds kind of like the left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing.
869346,Salmonidstalker,2014-08-25 23:48:00,265,"If the OPP deems the life jacket unsafe even if you're wearing one then you can be charged. Could it be handled differently, absolutely no question. I'm guessing bad weather this summer meant less boating, which means less income from fines on the water.  OR, the officer probably found other things wrong and let them off with a smaller fine.  I also agree with the law with respect to whether or not the officer deems the life jacket is safe to use.  I like to see enforcement, it means people are out making sure others are being protected. The word gets out fast with fines and with death on the water. People should put safety as a top priority, not fun."
869347,kickingfrog,2014-08-25 23:57:00,8333,So I can have 2 legal lifejackets stowed on the boat and wear nothing which is perfectly legal.  But if I have the same 2 lifejackets stowed and I'm wearing another that has a tear that gets me a ticket?
869350,Salmonidstalker,2014-08-26 00:06:00,265,My guess is the stowed away life jackets weren't proper fitting.
869353,Spanky80,2014-08-26 00:07:00,152,"The local OPP detachment in Petawawa has a sign out in front of their building where they put words of wisdom...early summer that had something along the lines of ""The only useful PFD is the one that is on you"".  I contacted the detachment and reminded them what the law was, and to please stick to enforcing the laws we already have, there are many of them for you to choose from.  It is sad what we have allowed as acceptable in this nanny province.  The level of enforcement on the waterways would NEVER be acceptable on the roads."
869354,LostAnotherOne,2014-08-26 00:08:00,956,"Totally agree with you.  $240 is almost the same amount as if you are caught texting while driving which is $280.  Both in my opinion aren't even close, but the OPP has to keep people in check cause it does save lives.  I also think they ran into the wrong OPP officer."
869358,Bernie,2014-08-26 00:16:00,3190,I agree with your thinking Lew.In most cases if they suggested putting on a different life jacket and trashing the old one would have been sufficient.They certainly are not making themselves look good in the eyes of the public. No wonder I and others take a different route when they are spotted in the area.
869362,Sinker,2014-08-26 00:20:00,8692,"The last time I was stopped by OPP they ran into my boat so hard that they almost capsized me. Water came over the opposite gunnel, it tipped me so much. I can walk the gunnels on my boat, its that stable.  They stopped us for a routine check while we were duck hunting, and tried to give my dad and I the gears for wearing camo mustang survival suits(we had other PFDs on board), then tried to give us a hard time about my 10 million candle spotlight not being able to float and wasnt water proof (I had the useless little light that comes in the kit as well....and it worked). My old man lost it on these clowns, and asked them to go pick on the next boat that had 4 guys with no lifejackets on. This was in December on the bay of quinte, and it was a nasty day!  They left. Didnt even ask for our hunting or firearms license....nothing. No appology for ramming us though. Jerks!  S."
869365,OhioFisherman,2014-08-26 00:23:00,6623,I would imagine it's a lot easier to write tickets on people less likely to travel a long distance to fight them? How many people will travel a long distance and spend more money on it than the cost of the ticket? They may just decide not to come back? That would be just great for the tourism industry?
869375,NANUK,2014-08-26 01:09:00,797,"So much for promoting tourism,"
869377,bigbuck,2014-08-26 01:29:00,2449,"Reminds me of Roscoe P Coltrane sheriff of Hazard County. People need to tAke the time to fight these types of nonsense tickets. Judges do not look kindly to police officers who issue them. I got a Bull ticket last year just south of Bala. I got pulled over, the officer told me I was speeeding (I was 5k over the limit) and proceeds to give me a ticket for failure to obey sign, looking in my rearview, I did not even see a radar gun on the dash. He didnt know how fast I was going and when he ran my plate and saw I was from out of town, he pulled me over and gave me a vague ticket. I took the time to go to court, the officer was shockeed to see me there, as soon as my name was called, the crown stood and asked to have it dismissed because of a lack of evidence. On my way out I said to the officer ' have a great day Roscoe'. He knew exactly what I meant and his face turned red. Great way to promote tourism."
869388,OhioFisherman,2014-08-26 02:01:00,6623,"http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/wearing-life-jackets-should-be-mandatory-opp-1.948856  Did they actually ever change the law, or are they enforcing non existent ones?"
869391,Joey,2014-08-26 02:16:00,9122,"I also agree with you Lew.   Sometimes you  get the good cop and sometimes you get the bad cop.   Certainly not worth driving up to Sudbury court to fight it so they know you have not much choice.   It's a shame some of them have to act that way, but sometimes they get the ""God"" complex and are better than everyone.   Hope they sleep well at night"
869392,Dara,2014-08-26 02:31:00,3052,My guess is the stowed away life jackets weren't proper fitting.   What possible reason could you have for GUESSING that
869399,thegrumpyfisherman,2014-08-26 03:02:00,59,"I got stopped by the MNR in South River in the spring, amazing the different approaches the two take.  The fellows who stopped me asked to see my two licenses and that was it.  Didn't ask for safety equipment or even to see in my live well.  Reminded me of the new Walleye regs and away they went.  Have yet to run into cops on the water but I'm sure my time will come.  Sounds like I'm better off stowing the life jacket, can't split hairs if its in storage!"
869409,lew,2014-08-26 08:48:00,12766,"Thanks for your replies folks and am happy to hear most are in agreement with me that both these incidents could have been handled in a much better fashion.  I've always been 100% pro cop and have been stopped many times on the water and have never had a bad experience with any of them, but a couple guys like the ones in my post can sure make the good ones look bad and paint them all with the same brush."
