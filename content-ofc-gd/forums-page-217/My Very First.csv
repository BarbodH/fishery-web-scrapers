870342,jackz905,2014-09-01 21:06:00,6,just bought my very first calcutta te dc was loving the reel till i put it to the test against some kings... didnt last very long the drag washers are all fried has anyone have this problem before...  i was wondering if its because a lil moisture got inside the reel im not sure how but i opened it up there was some moisture on the inside and no not grease
870348,esoxansteel,2014-09-01 21:58:00,1307,Might have something to do with the Kings
870352,NANUK,2014-09-01 23:00:00,797,"what size Calcutta ? I don't have a Calcutta but have a few Tekotas 600 that have seen their fair share of Lake Ontario kings, still very smooth drags going for more than 5 years. I can't imagine Calcutta having inferior drags than Tekota ? can you post some pictures of drag washers ? I would contact Shimano Peterborough, I am sure they will take care of the issue. or you can just upgrade to carbontex drag washers."
870353,Terry,2014-09-01 23:02:00,14456,I don't consider calcutta te dc a  reel to  catch kings on
870358,NANUK,2014-09-01 23:39:00,797,"I don't consider calcutta te dc a  reel to  catch kings on I agree, I just checked the specs & schematics of TE200, Max drag 10 lbs, there is only 1 drag washer on top of the main gear and a smaller washer under that gear."
870361,OhioFisherman,2014-09-02 00:15:00,6623,"I remember my brother going to Manistee Michigan a long time back and trying to fish for Salmon in the rivers there with Bass tackle, burnt drags and broken gears.  Bass tackle isn't really design to fish for species that make long runs.  "" I can't imagine Calcutta having inferior drags than Tekota  "" that reel does mention "" ""A trollers dream â€” the Shimano Tekota is the perfect cross-over reel for both freshwater and saltwater species, from walleye to tuna.""  I am guessing a Tuna gives a bit better fight than a walleye? A reel that will handle Tuna is probably much more suitable for Salmon fishing."
870363,BillM,2014-09-02 00:30:00,17367,"I don't consider calcutta te dc a  reel to  catch kings on  +1..   You lost the battle before it even began, lol."
870409,jackz905,2014-09-02 03:43:00,6,it has even max drag for fall kingsive used reels with 8lb max drag and no issues and lots of my friends use the te dc for them no problems just trying to find out if anyone has burnt out the drag washers on these reels but clearly you guys are thinking about out in the lake not off shore
870420,Gallie,2014-09-02 12:25:00,1215,I used my calcutta 400 te as a trolling reel for a while as i upgraded my salmon gear. Brought at least one tyee to the boat with it too. Different model but i had zero issues with it
870421,lew,2014-09-02 12:32:00,12766,I use TE's for casting but for trolling big baits it's a Tekota 600LC
870433,Sinker,2014-09-02 13:59:00,8692,I get the impression this is used for casting from shore?  S.
870441,glen,2014-09-02 15:00:00,2641,I have fried lots of drags. Did the mosture cause the drag to fail?  I doubt it. Drags are a consumable part.   Put a new drag in and have at those kings again.
870442,OhioFisherman,2014-09-02 15:00:00,6623,"http://www.tacklewarehouse.com/Shimano_Calcutta_TE_DC_Casting_Reels/descpage-SCTEDC.html   "" For the bass angler, this means you can reach places you've never reached before and more importantly, where no other angler has ever put a lure! It also means when you pull up on a point or flat you can be much more efficient and fan cast the entire area without ever moving the boat. It will also allow you to cast to spooky, shallow fish long before they ever know you're there. 5:1 gear ratio and an incredible 10 stainless steel A-RB bearings and one roller bearing makes this reel a dream to cast. For the ultimate casting experience the CalcuttaTE DC will take you places you've never been before and no other reel can match. """
870645,jackz905,2014-09-04 03:49:00,6,paln on does anyone know how much better the carbonex drag washers are compaired to the normal shimano ones
870652,NANUK,2014-09-04 10:34:00,797,"Night & day, compare to regular felt washers, Much better than shimano's dartanium drag. Dry or lightly greased with Cal's or Shimano grease with PTFE"
870833,jackz905,2014-09-05 03:55:00,6,does it add any extra to the max drag or does it just make it smoother
870850,NANUK,2014-09-05 10:29:00,797,"Both,"
