We had planned to camp out on an island in the tent for three days but the weather scuppered those plans. We opted for just a day trip on Saturday, but left by 7am so we could make the most of it.  Jack and me have developed quite the routine for our trips to Lac Seul, and he was super pumped to show and tell mum all about it!  This summer has been awesome in terms of time spent in the outdoors with my little dude. I always wanted him to love it as much as I do and for now that seems to be the case.  The Lac Seul routine is pretty cool and we added a few extra things to it this time which made for an action packed day that started with…………...      STOCKING THE COOLER UP WITH FRESH SPRING WATER            A FRESH, HIGH FIBRE, LOW  FAT ORGANIC BREAKFAST OF DEW CHILLED, WILD BLUEBERRIES…NOM….NOM….NOM.                       LUNCH WAS GATHERED IN NEAR RECORD TIME WITH THREE COMPETENT ANGLERS IN A BOAT ON THE FISH FACTORY THAT IS LAC SEUL            THEN BACK TO BASE CAMP TO PREPARE LUNCH……….                 …….AND GO FOR A SWIM             ……..AND COLLECT SOME COOL LAKE STUFF                                        FEAST ON FRESH WALLEYE                        ………….. WALK OFF A FEW EXTRA CALORIES                           GOT TOTALLY TUBULAR DUDE!                           ……..AND THEN ENDED THE DAY WITH ANOTHER FISHING SESSION             TOO MUCH FRESH AIR……LOL.              SOME VIDEO FROM THE DAY……….  "

870638,Sinker,2014-09-04 02:34:00,8692,Great report simon.  S.
870639,Nipfisher,2014-09-04 02:39:00,2449,Great day Simon. I love the picture of the plate of food against the backdrop of the lake.
870640,can u fish,2014-09-04 02:50:00,326,What a great way to spend a day and some awesome walleye fishing to boot.  Thanks for sharing Simon Cheers.....

I feel the name of the lake should be changed to ""Content in the embrace of Family Lake"" Thanks for sharing.  I hear ya, the novelty factor of winter has all but worn off now, it was brutal last year.  Lots of good memories from this year to get us through….then of course there is always ice fishing and snowmachines!  Great report simon.  S.  Thanks S!  What a great way to spend a day and some awesome walleye fishing to boot.  Thanks for sharing Simon Cheers..... Thanks man, Its back to school now for the dude and the evenings are drawing in, so It was great to get us all together on the beach before the snow flies.  That looks like an awesome spot Simon . That plate of food looked delicious by the way Thanks man. The food was good except for the fries…lol. I tried to be clever and save on space by using the prepared fries as an ice pack for the cooler. Basically cut the the fries the day before and placed flat in a ziplock bag in water into the freezer. Comes out like a flat freezer block. Great in theory, and it might have just been the potatoes i was using, but when thawed came out like pieces of limp rubber, and were like greasy rubber after cooking……"

870779,limeyangler,2014-09-04 23:42:00,5204,"Try blanching them in hot oil then freezing, you may be surprised by the results.  I always 'double' fry them (blanch first, let them cool while i coat the fish), definitely comes out better. But to do that and then freeze them is more trouble than its worth when i could just use an ice pack."
