870314,spincast,2014-09-01 17:49:00,3279,"Finally found a couple kings - G managed to show me up by landing his - my first about 15 minutes later gave me a choice - spool or horse - so I ponied up, he bucked a few times and spat the hook. Heartbreak The next hit just as I was changing up; by the time I reached for the rod, gone;  then another as I was readying to drain a coffee - hit so hard broke off the 40lb test - then proceeded to porpoise behind us twice as if to say, nyeah, nyeah, nyeah.  G's was too tired to revive so smoker city she is,   37 inches and 23 lbs - exact match for his PB from 2012.    Bite slowed down and the boat traffic picked up so we headed West  to one of my spots and hit 6 lakers in 20 minutes.  Then the sun came out and things slowed down. By then we'd had 6 hours on the water and called her a day        These guys were crazy energetic today    Gotta love holiday Mondays with overcast skies and west winds  "

870346,Rod Caster,2014-09-01 21:40:00,5784,Looks like you got the pike slime washed out of the boat.  6 lakers in 20 minutes?
870347,lew,2014-09-01 21:58:00,12766,G always seems to find the brutes !!!

870558,spincast,2014-09-03 09:32:00,3279,"Looks like you got the pike slime washed out of the boat.  6 lakers in 20 minutes? yep - we actually would have had seven - but one of the double headers shook off as we traded Rods..... some day soon maybe that 4 hour drive will tempt you?  G always seems to find the brutes !!! You got that right Lew - and a great touch with the rod - been a while since he'd seen a screamer like that one but handled her like a pro  Nice fish, must be a workout for a younger lad to reel in such a big fish It takes everything he's got when its net time that's for sure. He came up with some choice ones a few years ago when he got one of these on. I'll never forget his comment after his first 15lb+ laker - this thing bull-dogged him for a long time. He lands it, pumps his fists, takes a deep breath then looks at me and says "" Dad, I learned a valuable lesson with that fish ........ Don't put your rod between your legs when fighting a big one...... it hurts your balls""."
