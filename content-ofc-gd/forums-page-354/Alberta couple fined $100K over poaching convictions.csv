742515,NAW,2012-11-07 16:03:00,4022,"Yikes..  $100,000 and their hummer! Serves them right!  131 counts.  They dropped 110 of them because they plead guilty to 21. I wonder what the charge would have been if they nailed them for all 131..  $625,000 and their house?"
742518,tb4me,2012-11-07 16:28:00,3295,It should have been..From what I understand they were shooting them from the hummer beheading the animals and leaving the edible meat behind..Heres the kicker they were farmed animals...So not only is it poaching it should have been theft too.
