742381,dobee,2012-11-06 21:57:00,301,"Well, another golf season is over with! It was a pretty successful year, took down a couple team cash events & for the first time I ended up taking my golf club's Club Championship (Rebel Creek) this year. Golf takes up a majority of my time in the summer, which leaves the fall to make up for lost time.  This time of year is bitter sweet, golf comes to a close and but the fish start to take their migratory runs up our beautiful ontario rivers and streams. I've been getting my fair share of water time this fall.. Last weekend was a blast with my favourite river clearing up, with perfect conditions.  enjoy the pics & be safe out there!              "
