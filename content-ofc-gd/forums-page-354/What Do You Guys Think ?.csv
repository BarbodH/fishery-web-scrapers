Check out the scar on the side and small deformity on the tail . What are the chances of that ?  August 2012   End of September 2012 "
741996,Sinker,2012-11-04 04:14:00,8692,I would say for sure it is. Pretty cool! Think you can do it again??  S.
742002,davey buoy,2012-11-04 11:42:00,5505,What are the odds that's the only one in there?:wallbash:Lol.
742007,Twocoda,2012-11-04 12:48:00,4130,Sherlock Holmes of fish....high praise for finding you twice...
742008,Roy,2012-11-04 12:59:00,13728,"And to think, you'd have never noticed that if you didn't always hold your fish the same way.  Congrats."
742009,chris.brock,2012-11-04 13:06:00,4053,"pretty cool, did you catch the fish twice from the same part of the lake?  that's good proof of C&R working"
742010,chris.brock,2012-11-04 13:09:00,4053,the pelvic fins are getting pretty orange in the September pic
742011,Sharkbait22,2012-11-04 13:09:00,297,"The odds might be better than you think. I've had the exact same thing happen to me in 1994 with a 5lb from a large lake deep in Algonquin Park.  The fish had a scar shaped like a v just below the dorsal. Couldn't believe it.  Fish was caught within 500m of previous location but over deeper water.  Makes me wonder just how many fish are in these lakes and how eager they are to bite.   Good example of C&R. This sort of thing happens a lot with bass, bull trout, cutthroat, muskie more so in moving waters.  Did you let him go for another day, give him a name, show him the dinner table?"
742015,fishindevil,2012-11-04 13:30:00,6254,Ya that's awesome and it's 100% possible I did it this summer in a Haliburton lake with a sweet 4lb largemouth !!!! And he had a piece of his  anal fin missing and exactly one week later I caught him again !!!! I was blown away !!!!! I will show pics of it on my year end report !!!!! I took it as a good luck sign and yes it proves c&r works for sure my bass was caught about 25ft of a floating raft and in the same spot a week later !!!!! I will remember that forever !!!! And he was released again so maybe next summer he will be a5.5lb it bigger I cat wait !!!! Cheers
742071,Moosebunk,2012-11-04 21:02:00,3970,Nice!  But it only counts as 1 fish caught. lol.
742080,BillM,2012-11-04 21:24:00,17367,Fish is hungry!
742088,captpierre,2012-11-04 22:24:00,2521,He thinks:  Oh crap......not again
742116,fishinguypat,2012-11-05 00:53:00,547,I think he wanted to be eaten
742143,NAW,2012-11-05 02:20:00,4022,Very cool man.  There was a big old bass we used to catch time and time again as kids growing up on the Maitland River.
742250,4x4bassin,2012-11-05 20:38:00,1025,"This fish was caught in the same bay (40' flat) both times and was released. It is pretty crazy when you think about it because the lake is fairly large (1000 acres) and she has alot of water to roam but I guess there is something in that bay that she really likes and this proves C&R does work ! This lake gets very little fishing pressure so maybe we can get her three times , I will be looking out for those markings"
