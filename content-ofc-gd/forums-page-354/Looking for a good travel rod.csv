Its a 6 foot medium set up, 2 pieces that feels like its more like a medium light action-feels like its got half decent components a good balace and  at 40 for the combo I'm thinking this may be the set up Am I just getting sucked in by the whiteness of the rod and my cheap Scottish heart or would this fit the bill (thinking this rod gets used 4-5 times a year max) Cheers Gordy"

741321,Duckie,2012-11-01 12:21:00,305,"for a good travel rod (true travel) I use a 3 peice St. Croix premier that is 7 foot med. power and it comes in a nice codura covered PVC rod tube.  I got mine at bass pro several years ago for $200 I think.  I have taken it to mexico, the bahamas, cozumel etc. and caught snapper, baracuda, bonefish etc as it fits in a suitcase..  for a true travel rod, its a great option.  but its a 3 piece.  for a two piece rod, there will be more options."
741340,Christopheraaron,2012-11-01 13:13:00,3525,"Cheap combo that I got on the road, not an amazing rod but it has really smooth drag and decent sensitivity, the only thing is that it's only 5'6""  http://www.south-bend.com/products/combos/spinning/sb-eclipse-fiberglass"
741341,gordy28,2012-11-01 13:14:00,638,Fair enough - although I have numerous friends and family who work for Walmart - so I dont mind supporting them along with local tackle shops  In terms of value on a fly  - agreed - this would be a backup rod to my other combos that are all 1 piece set ups  Figured it was a silly idea - feedback seems to support it G
741352,DOS,2012-11-01 14:37:00,119,"For a back up rod who can go wrong with an ugly stick.  Yes you will lose sensitivity but they are all but indestructible. Get a half decent reel with it and you will have a great backup for under $100.  You also wouldnt mind lending this rod to a kid or a friend unlike a $200 St. Croix.  I have a 7' ML Triumph in a case under the back seat of my truck always, whole combo and case was about $150, absolutely love that rod...  RED"
741362,jayess,2012-11-01 15:23:00,187,"I picked up a St. Croix Triumph that breaks down into 5 or so pieces. Sounds like some other members received a nice case with their. Mine included a fabric ""roll-up"" case -- kind of like rolling up the pieces in a towel so very little true protection. Bummer on top of it all is that with a reel attached, the rod no longer fits in the case!  Other than that, nice rod -- unlike the other 2 St. croix rods I own. Love 'em!"
741860,gordy28,2012-11-03 11:09:00,638,Thanks guys will definitely check out the options mentioned above
742222,torco,2012-11-05 17:16:00,656,I wouldn't skimp too much on the rod and reel combo. If you are worried about breakage why not buy a nice travel tube or case for it.
