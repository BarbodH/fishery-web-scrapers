I only have access to a few right now, but, figured I'd post these for now.  Just to set up the story, a bit, when Craig first got this boat as a gift from his wife, it was literally a frame with rotted wood.  He completely rebuilt it purchasing all the materials up in Powassan.  She is finally ready to go (unfortunately I don't have the pic with the motor, and, totally finished boat yet) and he was hoping to possibly launch this fall.  Looks like a spring launch is more likely.  Five years, and, about 1000 hours of labour later!!  Think he is almost sad that the project is over, LOL!  Anyways, here are a few pics of the latter stages of the project.               I'll try and get some of the shots of both the rotted hulk it used to be, and, the finished product it now is, soon. They truly are a beautiful boat, and, I'm sure bring back memories for many elder members of the board."

742507,crappieperchhunter,2012-11-07 14:29:00,2582,"Having done a wee bit of wood working I can truly appreciate the effort that went into this project. I hope he is proud of his work and gets lots of enjoyment out of his ""New"" boat.  Thx for sharing with us and please share anymore pictures you might get."
742508,capt_hooked,2012-11-07 14:31:00,212,"Beautifull...!  Tell Craig,  I have 15 of these boats... He's welcome to come up this spring and fix them up for me...      the capt't  "
742527,Freshtrax,2012-11-07 19:00:00,2215,Hopefully mine will look half that nice come spring.
742530,Roy,2012-11-07 19:16:00,13728,"That's fantastic, Frankie! Thanks so much for posting this. Craig must be proud and he should be! It's a beautiful piece!"
742534,mike rousseau,2012-11-07 19:42:00,4661,Wow  Amazing work.... That'll be an heirloom to treasure....
742542,fishnsled,2012-11-07 21:04:00,3520,"Incredible!! It looks like it is in showroom condition.  Very nice to see Craig's labour of love, thanks for posting Frank. Which model is it?"
742544,mercman,2012-11-07 21:10:00,7054,Amazing !!!!!!!!! That brings back memories of my Gramps.His was almost identical.  Phenomenal boat .  
742654,asdve23rveavwa,2012-11-08 12:37:00,2690," Think he put a 60 hp motor on it.  Just enough oomph for when he needs it.    I'll let him know.  If it means fishing all spring, when he isn't working, he might be tempted!   Looking forward to seeing some pics of your job!!   Glad you enjoyed Roy!!  I'll try to get those other pics soon.  Craig is a very humble guy, but, I am sure he is quite proud.  He has done an amazing job, almost singlehandly.  Think Juli's brother gave him a hand, bending the strips (which is pretty darn hard to do yourself)   It's an 18 fter Will. I think it is the Nipissing...I'm sure Bernie could correct me if I'm wrong.    To everyone else, glad you enjoyed!  Anyone that fishes down at Long Point next spring keep your eyes open, more than likely you will see it cruising the bay."
