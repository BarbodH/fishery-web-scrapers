742682,jimmer,2012-11-08 19:45:00,2730,Does anyone know what this might be worth? My father picked it up at the end of the war when he was policing civilians who were not to be carrying weapons. Interesting piece.  
742683,jimmer,2012-11-08 19:47:00,2730,Can't figure out how to put multiple pics in one post. Can anyone help?

742686,jimmer,2012-11-08 20:13:00,2730,"Thanks, that's a great site."
742746,Twocoda,2012-11-08 23:59:00,4130,If your looking to sell...you should contact Lemmy (lead singer of the band Motorhead) he is a fanatic for blades and war memrobilia...
742799,SirWhite,2012-11-09 01:36:00,210,"That's wierd how Deutschland is spelt on the blade. LOoks like a ""hidden"" ss symbol? Piece of history there."
742807,Fisherman,2012-11-09 01:57:00,7201, And where are you seeing this?
742839,SirWhite,2012-11-09 03:24:00,210,"Between the t and c? its susposed to be an ""s"" but doesn't look like the ""s"" used earlier in the scribe."
742870,Fisherman,2012-11-09 12:00:00,7201,"There's no hidden ""SS"" there, that's the way it's written. There are other branches that have the ""SS"" engraved."
742872,bigugli,2012-11-09 12:33:00,6138,"During the postwar occupation, a lot of bartering went on between Canadian soldiers and the German populace. A lot of nazi contraband, weapons, souvenirs made there way back to Canada. Medals, daggers and lugers were the most popular. One family member, a stamp collector, obtained vast stockpiles of nazi postage in return for various military items, like food, clothing, medicine. One Canadian MO brought back hundreds of original pieces of Hummel figurines in return for off duty medical care."
742874,fishindevil,2012-11-09 12:55:00,6254,"contact the war heritage museum and send them the pics they will verify for sure,they would probly be interested as well...cool peice of history...  treat it with respect"
742887,jimmer,2012-11-09 14:36:00,2730,"I treat it well, but I think there was damage on the blade prior to me getting it. I treat it as well or better than my father did. Thanks for the input by everyone, I will contact the museum."
