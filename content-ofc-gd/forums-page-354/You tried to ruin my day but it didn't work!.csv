742735,Ron,2012-11-08 23:24:00,1683,"For those of you who have never fished the area in question, you have no idea on how the fishing is done. It is a narrow channel which has boat traffic going in and out of the river. it is a narrow passage as on the far side away from the pier. You have no option but to troll closer to the pier as that is the navigation channel. Unfortunately, there is limited space for both the shore anglers and the boaters."
742736,Live2fish85,2012-11-08 23:30:00,1633,"It doesn't matter if you are trolling or just heading out into the lake, they will cast it at you regardless. These guys doing it are morons. When I was there recently we had the same thing and we were just heading out to the lake. Not even trolling. One hit our boat, next time we went past I had a bulldawg on and as soon as one landed about two feet away I casted over hos line and snagged his lure. In the end he had to cut his line or I was going to have a new combo along with my new bulldawg.  As Brian said it is just a couple of them doing it and that was the case for us to.  Green Canada you really are annoying."
742739,lew,2012-11-08 23:34:00,12766," The details have been explained several times, why can't you understand what you've been told ??"
742749,Terry,2012-11-09 00:03:00,14456," you are right, I don't know. That is why I was questioning it. I am glad that I don't have to deal with that, I do have a mean streak in me  2 of the last 4 times I went to hit the river I sat and watched others fish rather then crowd in and fight for fish and room I like fishing too much to make it an anger sport....  but if the shore fishermen have to pull their bait as the boat goes by, shouldn't the boat have to pull their baits as they are going by the shore fisherman  it just sounds like the boat fisherman has all the rights and the shore fisherman can go to hell"
742759,phatpelkey,2012-11-09 00:19:00,78,"i will say the area is narrow and like others have said some casters do cast close to try and get the next boater to move a bit more, i actually seen a guy aim for a newer ranger boat and it land on the seat, luckily the boat owner seen it in time to rip it off the seat before it snagged, but i see alot of boaters run rigth against the pair(within 25 feet or so just to piss the casters off and doing so while staring at you with a smirk), so no one is really better then the other here, but as a guy who does not have a boat and is stuck to shore it does get a little frustrating when the boat guys try and ruin your fun when they have the abiiity of fishing any part of the water"
742762,Live2fish85,2012-11-09 00:22:00,1633,"Terry there is still enough room for the shore fisherman to cast and cover a decent chunk of water when the boat go by, they just choose to cast at the boats to be jerks.  We boaters move over as far as we can even if we aren't trolling through there. Yet they still cast at us."
742763,Terry,2012-11-09 00:24:00,14456," in that case they are morons, that is what I am trying to get a picture of in my head just how this is happening"
742772,misfish,2012-11-09 00:43:00,29133, Thought I was slow. LOL J/K
742773,GreenCanada,2012-11-09 00:43:00,375," Plain and simple, if you see someone tossing spoons, fish somewhere else or get there earlier. If I were to go toss spoons, I would move to a different location if there was a boat(s) trolling where I planned to fish. It's about simple respect for one another. If someone is just tossing spoons at boats because they hate boaters and/or the fact that they aren't getting their way, then they obviously are idiots. If someone is already fishing ""your spot"", then go find another one for the day.  With regards to your childish comment, it would be nice if you were able to discuss an issue with someone without them personalizing an attack. I gather that you must disagree with what I said, but why not intelligently discuss what I said instead of name calling? I'm just looking for a bit of maturity, not your respect.   More comments have come out after what I said and I understand more about the layout of the pier and water but there is still no proof that someone screwed the sidewall of their tire. I don't know the details of that as I wasn't there and it seems that no one saw anyone do it. We have only seen the details of one side of the situation explained and while I believe that most of what was written happened, I don't take everything I read at face value, but I do understand this situation was frustrating for all those involved."

742778,Live2fish85,2012-11-09 00:57:00,1633,  No one called the shore fisherman all morons. Just the guys that do the stupid stuff morons.
742782,Joey,2012-11-09 01:05:00,9122,"Reminds me of the Queenston drift.  Had a few baits chucked way to close to us when the drift sends you in close to the shore (nothing you can do about it, the current dictates where you go).  Had a shore fisherman offer to break our legs one time  Real sportsmanlike"

CO's were out also and guess who they had first crack at   no worries though on my endI kind of thought it was funny  Good to see your boat caught a fish Brian"
742287,spinnerbaitking,2012-11-05 23:53:00,1622,Very Nice & congrats FisherJuli's ski Tight Lines SBK
742310,fishnsled,2012-11-06 01:54:00,3520,Amazing the 's that are out there. Thankfully there are great people like yourselves around. 	Awesome fish Juli!! Congrats!! A definite win for team BFJ (Brian Frank and Juli!! aka - team Big Fish Justice!)
742317,FisherJuli,2012-11-06 02:59:00,125,"Thanks, guys- that fish was the biggest blast in the world. Sorry, SlowPoke for not providing ear plugs!!!  The day was fantastic, the fish was super-duper, the company was ridiculously funny.... It was a great day. I got a pb like I could never have imagined. That's soooo cool, I am still grinning like a dorkus!!!"
742334,DanD,2012-11-06 11:39:00,2223,It’s great that this nimrod didn’t spoil the day for you and what a way to host a fishing trip by getting someone’s PB.  Brian maybe bring that tire down to the shop. I know it’s not the best to repair sidewall damage; but if it’s a clean puncture? I might be able to put a combi radial patch in it and you can use it for an extra spare; a plain steel rim is cheap?  Dan.
742413,SlowPoke,2012-11-06 23:29:00,2984,"Great idea and was also suggested by jjcanoe. I didn't opt for a trailcam but did purchase a dashcam that will record and play back on the unit or upload to PC. High def and wide angle lens should see them coming and going. As an added benefit, I can use it for work!!  You're our man on the ground; please keep an eye out for us.  I was thinking the same. I have 2 sets of rims and rubber and it would make a good backup to the spare. See ya soon!"
742463,SirCranksalot,2012-11-07 03:45:00,3291,If you let 1 single dickhead ruin your day you're going to have a lot of bad days!!
742513,Moosebunk,2012-11-07 15:34:00,3970,Total crap Brian!  Wished you had of got your hands on him just after releasing the fish.
742646,glen,2012-11-08 07:47:00,2641,What made this guy mad enough to screw your tire?  I don't remember ever having trouble with someone shore fishing when I am I my boat. I can't figure this out at all. Nice fish though WTG.
742678,SlowPoke,2012-11-08 19:38:00,2984,"Not sure, Glen and I don't know if I ever will understand why it happened. I don't know if it was directed at me, another boater or just a random act of stupidity. I'll never understand why I need a hard hat to pass the pier either. They cast at trollers, hunters and boaters just passing through the narrow channel. My old boat was hit, I've been splashed and I can't count how many times a lure has landed within a few feet. Anybody that has fished down there from a boat can attest."
742680,misfish,2012-11-08 19:42:00,29133,Sounds like they felt you were cutting through their casting area. How narrow is this spot?   Nice fish foresure.
742693,SlowPoke,2012-11-08 20:26:00,2984,"If I had to guess, I'd say 120' and about 80' is navigable. The far side from the pier is 2-3' deep. With any sense at all they realize its shallow by the buoy markers. But then again, with any sense at all they wouldn't be chucking muskie lures at boats. I never have an issue with salmon chuckers on Lake Ontario. These guys are a different breed."
742695,BucktownAngler,2012-11-08 20:34:00,582,"big musky baits cast farther then smaller baits, and if i was fishing from shore (which i dont do) i would want to cast as far as possible to cover the most water.  not that im condoning their actions, or anything like that.  just throwing that out there"
742699,Terry,2012-11-08 20:43:00,14456,I too am not sure I am getting this . you shared the water with them all day..are you saying you fished within casting distance of them all day long?
742701,lew,2012-11-08 20:51:00,12766," You don't have much choice at that location Terry as it's right at the mouth of the Thames where it empties into LSC.  Because of the narrow channel boats have to come somewhat close to the shore and rather than letting them through without hassling the boaters, a few of the shore anglers like to be jerks and toss their baits as close as possible."
742702,SlowPoke,2012-11-08 20:54:00,2984,"That goes without saying. If 80% Of the folks down there casting can share the water with the boats, why can't the other 20%? Some of these guys will speed retrieve so they can get a second shot in. Most boats will give a wide berth either out of courtesy or fear; there's no need for target practice."
742705,SlowPoke,2012-11-08 21:00:00,2984,"Not necessarily. When boats fish the river, they may pass the pier every 15-20 minutes if they are fishing the mouth as well. The pier is only about 80' long but you have no choice but to pass it coming in and out of the river."
742707,Terry,2012-11-08 21:05:00,14456," without a doubt, the guy should not be throwing baits at the guys in the boat...  however   who has the right to fish there or more rights the guy in the boat or the guy on shore..I don't know...  I do know the way I handle things...if I am the first on on the spot fishing I feel I have the most rights so if I am first and on a boat , then the guy on shore needs to pull his bait each time I troll by  if the guy on shore was first I would move the boat as much as I could away from the guy and speed up to get away from him.. however if it was me and a guy was fishing from shore first, I would indeed go somewhere else....  a boat navigating through the area has the right ,but I do not feel that applies to a guy fishing from a boat and a guy fishing from a boat has to give way to a boat navigating through the area..  I don't know the details but I don't get it from what has been said....might be one of those things that you have to be there to get it..    I never got the Blair witch movie either so......"
742712,lew,2012-11-08 21:19:00,12766,"If there was lots of room Terry, it wouldn't be a problem but it's just not like that. The water on the east side of the channel is quite shallow so all boats have to move tighter to the west side where the shore casters are. As Brian said, most of the guys are good and will hold off on their cast if a boat is trolling thru, but a few just like to cause problems.  A bit of give and take goes a very long ways sometimes."
742715,Terry,2012-11-08 21:22:00,14456,"yeah I was typing while he was posting so I didn't see his reply, he did explain that"
742724,Handlebarz,2012-11-08 22:17:00,3790,This was not a problem 4 years ago. Yes there was a lot of people fishing there but the last 3 years there are some axe bags that try to splash or hit boats.  When most boats pass by they are 1/2 way across the river but the baits still keep getting chucked out there. Now there are some boats that go to close on purpose just like there are ones who make the extra long cast to be jerks.  Like everything there are good and bad. But in the end if a boat is passing by give them a break.
742727,SlowPoke,2012-11-08 22:25:00,2984,"On most days its just a minor issue and there are some inconsiderate boaters out there too... Running planer boards in the river, chasing a large muskie around the river in a 20' pontoon boat shouting ""it's okay, I know what I'm doing. I just using light gear!"" Ahhh good times."
742733,GreenCanada,2012-11-08 23:13:00,375,"  I gotta say I agree with you completely Terry... but like you said we weren't there and don't know the details.  I for one will likely take flak from others here, but I get buzzed quite often by guys in boats zooming past shore where I might be tossing spoons. They see me and don't seem to care that they are impeding my ability to fish. I typically fish the headwaters of Lake O tribs, so I'm not a typical pier fisherman. If someone in a boat was impeding my ability to fish from shore (especially if I was there before them), I will kindly ask them to find another spot, as they have a much easier time doing so and also considering the fact I was there first. If they continued to impede my ability to fish, I would have no problem tying on a old garbage spoon and huck it towards their boat. Sometimes people don't listen until they are being inconvenienced in the same way.  As far as the screw in the tire goes. Sucks that you got a flat, but I don't see the point in making accusations and the like without proof. It is quite easy to get a screw in a sidewall and I would chalk it up to a bad coincidence. Why not just say that you went out fishing and a person fishing from shore was irritated that you caught some fish just out of his reach?  Positivity breeds positivity..."
742734,HTHM,2012-11-08 23:19:00,4082,"Trim up, bow point away from shore and HIT it.   :devil:"
742156,SlowPoke,2012-11-05 03:49:00,2984,"I shared the water with you all day. I ducked your flying bulldogs. I dodged your Double D's. I let you watch us catch and release a big fat muskie just out of your casting range. I changed the tire that you drove a screw through the sidewall on my boat trailer. I went home and enjoyed a nice meal with my boat guests. You went home smelling of skunk, and whatever scumbag smells like. I win."
742157,BillM,2012-11-05 03:57:00,17367,"....and people thought steelheaders were a bad lot, lol."

742165,SlowPoke,2012-11-05 04:44:00,2984,They are too! Watch out if one of them drives a screw through your vest!
742166,Grimace,2012-11-05 04:49:00,2020,"Sounds like you had a run in with my buddy's ex old lady.  Seems like you came away fairly clean out of the whole ordeal.  :-)  Oh, and as a side note, there is absolutely no proof of any positive role Karma could play into this.  If the idea of Karma was true I would not think that 15 million children would starve to death every year world wide.  It is a lovely thought that some day that some deserving people would be showered with good fortune and horrible people would be challenged with the opposite fate but the simple fact of the matter is this is untrue.  If it were true than you would have to assume that the bad things that happen to innocent people are deserved and the riches that are bestowed the powerful are well placed."
742168,Toad Hunter,2012-11-05 04:56:00,261,"Karma is meant to be a balance of energies, Maybe slow poke was having too much positive and needed to be brought down a peg ?  - but it sucks some people are just scum bags."

As for the looser on the dock and his childish actions -judging from the expression on Juli's face, I bet her excitement just rubbed the fool's nose in the fact that you know how to catch em, and he dont.  You beat him twice - 1 by landing the ski and 2 by not letting that ruin your day."
742183,phatpelkey,2012-11-05 12:55:00,78,"are you trying to say somone purposely put a screw in your side wall becuase you caught a fish, i dont believe that"

We do know that it was deliberate, no way, no how, that screw got into that section of the tire any other way!  Sad that there are people like that in the world."
