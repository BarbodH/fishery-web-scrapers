742597,Freshtrax,2012-11-08 00:12:00,2215,I know of a stream in and about the alliston area that salmon and trout come to spawn in. It is only about 6 ft wide at times. It is completely blocked with driftwood and fallen trees in a few points. Does this affect the fish? Some seem to get through but when I say blocked its really blocked.   I could get the land owners permission to clean it up but I'm sure there are laws about this stuff. I's there a group I  Could get I contact with to organize a stream cleanup/restoration next summer or am I worried for nothing?

Permission from various agencies is usually required for this...from the conservation authority, sometimes right up to federal levels ie the DFO.  I'll send you a PM so we can talk in detail - I'll forward your concern to the group.  It's quite possible that they know about it already."

742613,Sharkbait22,2012-11-08 00:51:00,297,You might want to watch this video on the importance of large woody debris for healthy streams.  It’s about 30 mins long with pictures of ‘healthy’ debris jams and placements vs. degraded stream channels.  http://www.oregonwild.org/about/blog/in-praise-of-large-woody-debris
742616,Freshtrax,2012-11-08 01:02:00,2215,I ain't moving anything .  I sent an email to the nottawasaga steelheaders I will be taking some pictures in the next few weeks and sending those over as well I'm going to leave this one to the pros.
