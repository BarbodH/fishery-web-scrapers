She asks him why he is staring and he replies, ""I have a question to ask you but I don't want to offend you.""  She answers: ""My dear son, you cannot offend me. When you're as old as I am and have been a nun as long as I have, you get a chance to see and hear just about everything. I'm sure that there's nothing you could say or ask that I would find offensive.""  ""Well, I've always had a fantasy to have a nun kiss me."" She responds,  ""Well, let's see what we can do about that: #1, you have to be single and #2 you must be a Catholic.""  The cab driver is very excited and says, ""Yes, I am single and I'm Catholic too!""  The nun says, ""OK, pull into the next alley."" He does and the nun fulfills his fantasy.  But when they get back on the road, the cab driver starts crying. ""My dear child."" said the nun, ""Why are you crying?""  ""Forgive me sister, but I have sinned. I lied, I must confess, I'm married and a I'm a Baptist.""       The nun says, ""That's OK, I am on the way to a Halloween party, and my name is Kevin."""
