741862,gordy28,2012-11-03 11:17:00,638,Just wondering if anyone has experience with Canoe Canada and their fly in outposts or the paddle in cabin Interested in Quetico for our 2014 trip (someone's 40th bday ) Not to interested in fishing out of a canoe for an entire week though-love the fact that quite a few of their outposts have a main lake with boat fish but then many portage with Canoe or stashed boat options-especially little Gull and Namaygoos options Www.canoecanada.com Cheers Gordy
741868,solopaddler,2012-11-03 12:05:00,8605,"I've used them twice, but to rent canoes never for their fly in outposts.  Personally if I'm driving to Atikokan I'm paddling Quetico, no way I'm doing a fly in trip.  The fishing in Quetico is remarkable, plus it's the best flatwater paddling in the world imo. It's possible to plan a route with very few portages, just short liftovers around waterfalls or very short trails. Absolute amazing campsites and scenery as well.  The outposts look okay but they're not unusual in any way. Most fly in outposts in northwestern ON have adjacent portage lakes with boats cached on them."
741869,gordy28,2012-11-03 12:15:00,638,"Geez- almost feel like I should just PM you with all my questions Mike-you are a weath of knowledge I hear about the paddle and camp option- my concern is that I hate fishing out of a canoe-mainly because I suck at it... Plus I like a bed and a shower when I can get it But a few guys are very interested in Quetico-so this seemed like a good medium - the Little Gull option actually gets you into Quetico proper with a canoe for day trips As always-thanks for the help I'm actually building out a trip evaluation spreadsheet right now- 4 different options and then sub categories about specific lodges, links to reports etc as a way to get us down to a type of trip (fly in outpost, fly in lodge, drive/boat to lodge/outpost and paddlie trip). Cheers Gordy"
741914,bare foot wader,2012-11-03 16:09:00,1354,  building a spreadsheet??? must be an accountant or analyst lol  nice to know I'm not the only one who uses excel in his personal life
741949,gordy28,2012-11-03 20:04:00,638,"Close- I'm a marketing guy who started out working with analysts- definitely use excel for personal life-budgeting, packing lists - love it-keeps me organized lol"
741989,chris.brock,2012-11-04 01:31:00,4053,"gordy, give us a list (spreadsheet not required) of what's most important to you for your trip, I'm sure alot of people here would have some input that would be interesting, Mike especially"
742006,gordy28,2012-11-04 11:59:00,638,"Okay-cool idea thanks Chris We haven't as a group defined the parametres but here's mine: No more than a 9 to 10 hour drive from the GTA Limited to no other cabins on the lake Outposts have indoor showers, lights and running water Target species walleye and pike(smallies as well would be a nice bonus) Lots of fish w the opp to catch a trophy (walleye over 28, pike over 38) Like the idea of having portage lakes/rivers from your outpost-especially if its for a diff species Prefer a deep shield or even Balsam lake type lakes as opposed to shallow weedy ones Max budget of $1500 per guy all in (food, booze and outfitter cost) Some that have caught my eye-White River Air-Hambleton and Pickle in particular Hawk air-deluxe cabins, Kanipahow-Emabarass lake outpost, Lake Anjigami Ogis Point outpost Anyway-thanks to anyone who wants to post Oh-realize Canoe Canada is outside of the 9 to 10 hour drive-but interested because it covers off a lot of our wants and two members of our group really love the idea of exploring Quetico Cheers G"
742028,chris.brock,2012-11-04 15:01:00,4053," Mike probably mentioned Parks Fly In, Anjigaming or Abbey (can do some canoeing from Abbey into a few other lakes), Mike would know the most about Parks  http://www.outpostcamps.com/destinations/  here's one you likely haven't found, check out the chutes outpost, their website sucks and it's hard to find doing a search, really cool spot though, there is some small brookie lakes around that camp too   http://reocities.com/yosemite/forest/5502/page4.html  if you did the drive to Nakina (it's worth it I think), check out this place  http://www.twin-lakes-air.com/vanpoelelakeoutpostcamp.htm  private lake, but can boat out to a huge lake (other camps on the big lake, Kag), a private portage lake that's a good size, and access to pike, walleye, lakers and brookies, it's a rocky, deep, oligotrophic lake too (not a shallow dish pan)"
742221,torco,2012-11-05 17:12:00,656,"I'm an accountant, lol and always do my trip plans in excel. Too funny.  Happy planning"
742335,gordy28,2012-11-06 11:52:00,638, Thanks Chris-this is awesome and both spots have made it on yhe spreadsheet Parks is also on there Right now we haven't included many options. From Nakina-mainly because I'll max out at 7/8 days away and don't want to burn that much time driving We also are looking at the potential of blowing the budget up and doing either Kesagami Lodge or one of the Wilderness North Lodges (my father does one every year and loves it) Cheers Gordy
742511,adempsey,2012-11-07 15:16:00,1498,"  The Chutes always looked like an awesome place to me.  I tried to find information about it a couple years ago, but wasn't much on the net.   Do you know if it's still in operation?  This is the report I read on it that piqued my interest."
742675,chris.brock,2012-11-08 18:13:00,4053,"  I called them just less than a year ago, we were considering going there, the phone # worked, I talked to the owner, so as of then, it was still in business. I think a better website would help them out for finding new customers"
