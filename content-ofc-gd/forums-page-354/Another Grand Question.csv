741240,HyperActive,2012-11-01 00:02:00,56,"Been thinking about going down to the Niagara area to do some shore fishing this weekend. After reading a different post it made me realize the river maybe pretty wild and dangerous to fish from shore.  If that is true I think I may try the Grand for the second time. Last time I was out I threw Rapalas out for a couple hours or four with no luck at all. Then I threw worms out hoping to catch anything, only to realize the same fate.  I was underneath the bridge near the main street.  It was an awesome rainy day and just awesome being out there but I am wondering if someone will tell me if I am wasting my time using Rapelas there or not and possibly a better way to fish the Grand?  ON A SIDE NOTE!!!  I still haven't found the owner of the tackle box I found the first time on the Grand but I used to work at a high school and they had an after school fishing club. If it is still going I will donate the box to the kids."
741251,northernpike56,2012-11-01 00:35:00,717,I go to the top school in Halton and they still don't have a fishing club! So you could always give it to me instead
741252,northernpike56,2012-11-01 00:36:00,717,"oh yeah, what are you fishing for, and where? I have fished a few areas of the southern grand."
741264,Live2fish85,2012-11-01 01:08:00,1633,Good luck. The grand is super high.
741268,HyperActive,2012-11-01 01:33:00,56,  I was fishing for bass using cranks and I didn't venture too far from the bridge closest to Binbrook.  I was going to go to the falls using cranks but with having no knowledge as to the population of bass I didn't want to look like a tool bag taking up a spot and using lures for fish that may not exist there.  Maybe this w/e I will swallow any pride I have left and will start at the falls and put a day in following the river.  
741304,Toad Hunter,2012-11-01 05:14:00,261,up here around Kitchener/cambridge way I know the bass go nuts over black chatter baits. oops I've said too much
741308,Rich,2012-11-01 10:29:00,3927,I wouldn't touch the grand til it lowers. Wasted one day there this year during high water. Never again.
741314,Live2fish85,2012-11-01 11:46:00,1633,"I just came back from my parents place on Erie. The river is way to high, it actually looks like it should in the spring when ice is out."
741335,Mike Pike,2012-11-01 12:56:00,1332,"How are you fishing your worms HyperActive?  I like to use a slip float because it aids in casting and lets me hit more runs on the big river, plus I can make quick adjustments for varying depths.  Plastics work great too.  Retrieving a twister tail grub or plastic shad on a light 1/8th ounce jig head will keep your presentation above the rocks and weeds and should get you into a few.  Keep at it and good luck!"
741361,northernpike56,2012-11-01 15:22:00,717,tube jigs. or jigs tipped with some sort of minnow or worm work well too.
741414,Rich,2012-11-01 19:58:00,3927,I have not done well since september with a nightcrawler on the line there. Last good day tipping jigs with dead minnows was the ticket. cast and reel.
741539,HyperActive,2012-11-02 00:00:00,56,"Thanks to all for the great tips and suggestions guys,  I am going to learn how to rig my worms a bit better and take out the bait that was mentioned once the water lowers a bit.  It will be hard to put my cranks away sooner then I normally would but I guess that is part of the learning.  Thank you once again it is appreciated,"
741815,tb4me,2012-11-03 00:12:00,3295,The Grand is high and mighty right now..Carefull out there...
741822,vinnimon,2012-11-03 00:25:00,2593,"Thanks for the heads up,I was going to check it out in the am."
741827,hotsky,2012-11-03 01:21:00,400,I fished the Grand several times this year. I've had good luck with plastics (twist tails) but didn't catch anything big. After Thanksgiving when it got a bit colder I was there twice nothing showed any interest in my offerings.
742033,LeXXington,2012-11-04 15:31:00,1928,I went down to the lower grand on sat. Water was moving but not too bad. Stop in at fishmasters he has a protected area to launch and the staff gave me some great tips where to try.
742119,Rich,2012-11-05 01:02:00,3927,Anyone get any in the tourney?
