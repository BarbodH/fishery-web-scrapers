742473,ah_long,2012-11-07 05:39:00,354,"I just winterized my boat and put it into an off site indoor storage.  To ward off moisture, I put a few of those starbrite moisture trap thingy  As for the little pest that would like to call my boat their home, I'm using grated Irish Spring Original Soap under the recommendation from a Marina.  What do you use to make sure little animals stay away? mothballs? Bounce Dryer sheets? Irish Spring?"
742477,SBCregal,2012-11-07 06:47:00,688,"we used mothballs in our trailer the first year we had it.  in the spring we found plenty of mouse mess and several holes in the tent material not to mention the mothball smell for half the summer.  last yr we used bounce sheets and didnt have any mice problems whatsoever, and no mothball smell.  the week after we prepped the trailer for the summer (and took the sheets out)  i found a family of baby mice in the corner of the trailer.  i know i'll using the sheets again this year.  ryan"
742478,mike rousseau,2012-11-07 07:13:00,4661,Bounce sheets... Work so far...
742488,Dan668,2012-11-07 12:36:00,1120,Bounce sheets for me
742493,alexmedic,2012-11-07 13:25:00,186,A friend of mine recommended whole cloves.  I tried it this year in my boat.  Guess I will have to wait and see.....
742498,BillM,2012-11-07 13:58:00,17367,"Used bounty sheets in the Lund last year, zero mice (and my parents have a lot of mice outside of the house)  Will be using them again this year."
742500,sunfish1,2012-11-07 14:05:00,9,i have always used whole cloves works for me and the boat smells nice in the spring ..lol
742509,Garnet,2012-11-07 14:51:00,2056,Moth balls and Bounce sheets.  Then I spray my tires and trailer with a weak solution of bleach and water.  And the special treat I get mouse kill seed from TSC. Leave the box nice and flat if it's disturbed in the spring time to look around.
742520,Cast-Away,2012-11-07 17:32:00,790,I use moth balls but always have trouble getting their little legs apart for the harvest!
742521,captpierre,2012-11-07 17:34:00,2521,somebody posted last year that a mouse made a nest in a partially full box of Bounce sheets
742532,mike rousseau,2012-11-07 19:32:00,4661, All I know is mice did a number on my boat the first winter I had it... Started using bounce sheets and haven't seen a sign of a mouse in the past few years....  Take it however you want
742541,whiskywizard,2012-11-07 21:04:00,305," +1 I used cloves in a derelict garage where we had to store our belongings while waiting to close on a house. Lots of evidence that there were many mice there, but cloves kept them out of our stuff.  I have a friend who didn't really understand what cloves are and used cloves of garlic in a tent trailer. It didn't slow the mice down one bit but he says at least he didn't see any vampires that year."
742573,aplumma,2012-11-07 22:19:00,6896,I use the ultra sonic units so far in 3 years no mice issues.   Art
742588,bobkayla,2012-11-07 23:14:00,148,"irish spring!!!! its hits me like a ton of bricks when i pull the tarp up in the spring, no wonder the mice wont go in there"
742623,BillM,2012-11-08 01:55:00,17367," Bounce smells SO good when the tarp comes off in the spring, lol!   Gets rid of any lingering fishy smell."
742625,RickOnt,2012-11-08 01:56:00,669,Cloves will do the Job!
