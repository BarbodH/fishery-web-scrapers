742361,Harrison,2012-11-06 18:03:00,2202,"Sorry, I do not mean to sway the direction of this thread and turn it about fizzing.  However, if you are planning on fishing deep often, you may want to look into it.  Short on time to write about fizzing now, but a search will pull up lots of good info including how to and pro/cons.  Not my intent again, sorry."
