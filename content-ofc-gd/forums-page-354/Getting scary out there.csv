742346,BillM,2012-11-06 13:51:00,17367,"Jose, when was the last time that torque wrench was calibrated?   Might be your issue.  One thing I love about most German cars, no studs, just wheel bolts"
742350,kemper,2012-11-06 14:23:00,2232," I think Bill is right on this one - might be time for a new wrench.  I've changed a whack of wheels on Subarus (1999 Impreza, 2001 WRX, 2011 Impreza, 2012 Impreza) and never run into that problem."
742405,salmon,2012-11-06 22:58:00,334,"That was my thinking too but I have access to several torgue wrenches and they are all the same. I should clarify though that one of the newer stud did not snap when I was tourquing it. It just snapped after installing it, I would be at ease to see that the thread was stripped but snapping? Funny how it is always on the passenger side fron and rear nothing on the drivers side. I do now have an service apptt to change all the rear ones. The parts and service managers know my status on this situation. I think IMO it could be faulty material."
742409,BillM,2012-11-06 23:22:00,17367,Only other way you'd snap a stud off is uneven pressure when tightening..   Very odd.  I'd get them all replaced..
742411,SirCranksalot,2012-11-06 23:23:00,3291,"  I thought these people would know their stuff:  http://www.lowenhart.co.jp/en/pdf/manual.pdf    ""Driving after installation When installing new wheels or relocating the wheels, you should retighten the lug nuts or bolts to the recommended torque after driving about 100 kilometers. Regular checkups are also required to check the lug nuts or bolts for looseness.  As for the wheels with center cover or center cap, verify whether retightening is needed or not.""    "
742412,BillM,2012-11-06 23:29:00,17367, They do..  Re-tighten after 100kms or so then you should be golden.  Unless I missed the part where they said to check every 300kms.
742420,bare foot wader,2012-11-06 23:53:00,1354,"   Depends on what you consider a regular interval  fluids, lugs, psi...I check religiously, every week   a friend called me and said his wheel just started wobbling, told him to stay where he was and I'd be on my way....he had 1 lug left when i got there! and it looked the previous owner had painted the rim knowing/not noticing 3 lugs were already missing....since he bought the truck he had been driving around with only 2 lug nuts for about 9 months..contractor truck, heavy loads, on the highway..sketchy  picked up new studs and went to remove the last remaining nut, it sheared off like butter..he was very lucky it didn't give out on the highway...pads weren't looking much better    "
742421,BillM,2012-11-06 23:57:00,17367,How did that ever pass a safety?
742424,bare foot wader,2012-11-07 00:07:00,1354," no safety inspections in BC...we just moved west and that was his first truck out, bought an 82 silverado off craigslist....it was pretty surprising to learn there is no safety inspection, only required for out of province vehicles, makes sense eh"
742428,GBW,2012-11-07 00:20:00,8460,"hey jchau53, I have a 2006 Impreza and never had a problem here.  80 FT LBs and I'm golden with the OEM wheels.  even with the steel wheels for the snows I do the same.  I drive the car hard (just blew both head gaskets at 145KM on the motor) and rail turns like a gocart so maybe you got one hell of a bad batch? the only other thing I can think of BillM said."
742435,salmon,2012-11-07 00:58:00,334,"Thanks The specs calls for 85 to 89 ft lbs of tourque maybe I will dial it down a bit. I tighten then to 50 Ft in a star pattern then again to 85 Soon I will change to my winters and hopefully I do not here the snap (break). I love the subies this is the only issue I have had since the car was new 2005 (125,000km)."
742436,BillM,2012-11-07 01:02:00,17367," Wow man, that's scary."
742437,GBW,2012-11-07 01:07:00,8460,"Any alloy wheels should not go past 80 ft LBs no matter the OEM.  hence the 100KM (or so) check to see if still snug. I to do the star but I go finger tight, then again at 50 then again at 80 in the same pattern the 1st nut went on.  good luck dude with the snows.  I'm thinking of doing mine this weekend."
742440,DRIFTER_016,2012-11-07 01:11:00,10439, No safeties here either Bill.
742444,Fisherman,2012-11-07 01:20:00,7201,"Heck there's no cars up there, how do you torque the nuts on a dog sleigh.."
742452,GBW,2012-11-07 02:18:00,8460,:rofl2: good one!  PS: I don't want to know!
742458,kickingfrog,2012-11-07 02:56:00,8333," Very carefullyâ€¦ but the same way here. Lefty loosey, righty tighty."
742553,Locnar,2012-11-07 21:32:00,645,"If that was sabotage... that's one greasy, scumbag move. Hell, no one owns a fishing spot (unless it is on your property)... if someone manages to stumble across it, well... deal with it."
742607,nofish4me,2012-11-08 00:24:00,404," it might be that way now, but it wasn't always that. Hahaha"
742610,irishfield,2012-11-08 00:41:00,26272, Yah.. I still have two cars with lefty loosey and righty loosey on the same car! Generally they get snapped off by the first door knob without chrysler knowledge slinging an impact gun!
742651,Rich,2012-11-08 12:03:00,3927,People threaten to kill me and vandalyze my stuff all the time. Jealous
742026,SirCranksalot,2012-11-04 14:36:00,3291,Anyone else see this?? Scroll down to Oct 26 posting. http://www.canadasflyfishingoutfitter.com/blog/
742027,Cudz,2012-11-04 14:44:00,2652,wow!  that is nuts (no pun intended).  Who would do something like that and think it was a good idea?  Reminds me of those people who used to put spike into trees so people the people cutting down the trees with chainsaws would hit them and the chain would fly off with serious results at times.
742030,Grimace,2012-11-04 15:12:00,2020,Insanity.
742031,DoubleDigits,2012-11-04 15:19:00,140,"Quite a leap to assume that the diagnosis of this mechanic suggests murderous anti-fishing saboteurs are at work...This incident, in all likelihood, has nothing to do with fishing..."
742032,Burtess,2012-11-04 15:25:00,901,"A mechanic cannot say after the fact if this was due to someone loosening the lug nuts or not.  All it takes is different torques on each lug nut and one can start to lossen off.  As soon as one is loose many times the others will follow (personal experience).  That said, I would hope there aren't people around doing stuff like this!  Burt"
742034,kickingfrog,2012-11-04 15:31:00,8333,"Not putting it past some wackjob to do what is alleged, but I'd also have some questions. Namely was the guy's mechanic the last one to work on his wheels?"
742035,DoubleDigits,2012-11-04 15:32:00,140, Exactly.
742036,crappieperchhunter,2012-11-04 15:49:00,2582,Alot of assumptions here. To turn this into something that happened because a car was parked at a fishing location is way over the top.  Not saying it isn't a possibility. Just saying it's a little irresponsible to make those kinda accusations.
742037,Gallie,2012-11-04 16:16:00,1215,I cant remember how long ago but there was a few cars that had lugnuts loosened in the simcoe county area. They were done to random vehicles in the area. Im not sure anyone was caught or if a motive was determined. It never hurts to check your vehicle because there are some whackjobs out there
742039,irishfield,2012-11-04 16:23:00,26272,Geez Terry... we could have went public.. some bugger from Kinmount didn't like us fishing their lake and loosened my lug nuts.. damn near killed us by Coboconk !! There is no way in hell that the mechanic could make that conclusion if the wheel fell off! As noted.. he was probably the original installer. One piece of crud behind the wheel at torquing and you can still get this... We limped home on the three remaining studs after gingerly tightening them up. Two out of those three broke when the GM dealer went to remove the wheel  
742040,Roy,2012-11-04 17:04:00,13728,"Wow, this is how wars start.  What a bunch of garbage. It was surely due to the Bee Gees CD jacket left on his front passenger seat. Where do people come up with this stuff?"
742044,ch312,2012-11-04 18:24:00,1590," i agree, but i really wouldn't put it past some people that are trying to protect ""their"" spot.   who'd get charged? the guy loosening the lug nuts or the guy that caught them doing it and beat them with the tire iron they were using?"
742052,Fisherman,2012-11-04 19:17:00,7201," I'd just tighten their nuts a bit, never mind beating them.."
742053,SirCranksalot,2012-11-04 19:26:00,3291,Or nail their nuts to a stump and flip them over backwards!!
742066,BillM,2012-11-04 20:52:00,17367,"I took 4 out of the 5 off, I thought for sure he'd make it back home without issue.  /sarcasm"
742069,Terry,2012-11-04 20:58:00,14456, ah yeah remembering the good times...lol...sure were lucky
742070,Moosebunk,2012-11-04 21:00:00,3970,No substantial evidence of anything in that other than the guy's wheel came off.
742089,nofish4me,2012-11-04 22:29:00,404,"I had a trailer wheel come off one time and it was definetly caused by someone loosening the wheel nuts. No mistaken that fact.  The culprit even confessed.  Turns out, it was one of them sort of days and I forgot to put the final torque on them.    Hahaha(laughing now, it takes about 10 yrs)"
742138,Fish Farmer,2012-11-05 02:08:00,2234,"I lost a big Sheephead the other day, checked my line, low and behold, a nick in my line. I think Spiel had something to do with the loss. "
742187,SirCranksalot,2012-11-05 13:09:00,3291," It might be rash to jump to the conclusion that this was sabotage, but it's equally rash to jump to the opposite conclusion that it wasn't and dismiss it as 'garbage'. None of us know what happened and likely never will.  (BTW---Irish and others with Al. rims. The std recommendation is that you should check the torque on the nuts every so often---maybe 300km?. They are prone to loosening. With such a precaution I'm surprised they are allowed to be sold)   "
742189,Roy,2012-11-05 13:50:00,13728, That's absolutely correct. Sir.
742298,irishfield,2012-11-06 01:13:00,26272,"Yah.. I've been around for a bit! Truck came out of the GM dealer on Friday after 4 grand in service.. this was Sunday afternoon!  Lug nuts have been an issue since the days of guys trying to run Ford rims on Dodges in the 70's.. and the oversized pilot. That is the main issue with many custom alum wheels.. the center pilot is made too large so it can be a ""multi-product"" fit."
742324,BillM,2012-11-06 06:02:00,17367,"Aluminum rims don't require tightening every 300k...  Once you've swapped out your winter steelies, give them another tightening a few days later and you're good for the year.  There's also no need to torque the living crap out of them either..."
742338,Harrison,2012-11-06 12:11:00,2202,Well thats one way to spook some folks from fishing your river
742341,salmon,2012-11-06 12:41:00,334,"Once I swap over any rims either oem or steelies I re torque them to specs after 75 kms I have issues with them snapping in me though. Never used impact guns only torque wrenches. This is on my 2005 Subaru legacy, three snapped on right front and one right rear. I have changed all the fronts but the rear studs are a pain. I even had a new stud snap snap on me these were all bought from the dealership"
