741907,Gregoire,2012-11-03 15:26:00,1397,"A bulldawg or any other large plastic jerkbait would be a good lure. Don't be afraid to throw the smaller stuff as well. If you are tossing bucktails, and I would give them a go, make sure that you are slow rolling them, also try pausing and jerking them. You never know what might trigger a strike. One last thing, make sure that you have all of your release gear ready. Things can get a bit crazy with a musky on the end of you line. The small ones are especially fiesty. When you add in the instability of a canoe you need to prepare for the unexpected. If I was musky fishing from a canoe I would want handling gloves, hook cutters, jaw spreaders extra long pliers and a good sized net."
741909,Christopheraaron,2012-11-03 15:51:00,3525,here are my lures that could be used for muskie...   My link 
741911,Christopheraaron,2012-11-03 15:57:00,3525," got a net, hook cutters, extra long pliers, gloves, sounds like I just have to grab some jaw spreaders. And incase anyone was wondering that duct tape rod holder is long gone and i invested in  a salty."

741955,Sinker,2012-11-03 20:23:00,8692,  Its all good. I bet he doesn't see another boat if he goes there. Watch out for deer hunters though!  S.

741509,Christopheraaron,2012-11-01 22:53:00,3525,"Me and a friend from gooderham (near haliburton) are going to try for some walleye sunday, we'll have the canoe and can do short portages. We're going to try bark lake but after reading previous experiences there from some of the board members I'm a little sceptical (http://ontariofishingcommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=46564). I'd also love to get a musky for team 4, and then have a nice shore lunch of wallye, I've looked at haas, blue hawk, and confau but this guy says that none are that good, anyone have suggestions?"
741510,irishfield,2012-11-01 22:55:00,26272,"""Friend from Gooderham""... you admit that in the open?? LOL (don't worry, my Mother was one of the originals!)"
741511,Christopheraaron,2012-11-01 22:57:00,3525,  That bad? I'll live up there before down here...
741512,irishfield,2012-11-01 22:59:00,26272,"No.. If it had fit the plans, I would have taken over the family homestead on Glamour Lake years ago. Uncle died this summer.. guess my cousins will be getting the West shore now..."
741517,Christopheraaron,2012-11-01 23:08:00,3525, Looks like he also has some nice duck hunting real estate in the back...
741518,irishfield,2012-11-01 23:09:00,26272,Definitely... many hours spent playing in that marsh as a kid!
741519,Christopheraaron,2012-11-01 23:19:00,3525,you ever fish blue hawk?
741523,irishfield,2012-11-01 23:25:00,26272, No.. truth be told I never fished Glamour either. Wasn't in the cards when left at Gramma's every summer!   We shot stuff with guns instead.. lol
741526,chris.brock,2012-11-01 23:40:00,4053,"any of those lakes will likely be a little tough, I'd say Salerno would be your best bet for both walleye and skies, but it could be tough too"
741532,Christopheraaron,2012-11-01 23:48:00,3525,"Thanks chris, this might be a stupid question but what about burnt river this time of year?"
741568,chris.brock,2012-11-02 01:33:00,4053,"I'm only familiar with the Burnt River north (upstream) from Kinmount, if you're looking just to get a muskie (regardless of size), this would be a great bet, cast the shore and obvious cover with a small bucktail spinner, as for walleye, I'd guess you have an equal chance at the 50 million in lotto max tomorrow  I'm pretty sure I caught my first muskie in the Burnt north of Kinmount"
741572,GBW,2012-11-02 01:39:00,8460,G may know some too...  Correct. Best bet for a SKI is in kinmount.  Walleye and perch (snack food) might be a different tune so to say.  shore or boat fishing?  that depends on my reply to you C_K knowing when and how...
741576,GBW,2012-11-02 01:42:00,8460,"it's such a tight knit area to fish, some lakes get worked over hard!  PM me for more info"
741603,chris.brock,2012-11-02 04:24:00,4053,"one thing I forgot to add, if you try the Burnt for a muskie, retrieve fairly slow, and steady, the burning, top-water skipping stuff won't likely work this time of year, just my opinion"
741607,fishindevil,2012-11-02 10:11:00,6254,"try conteau lake for eyes,and yes thers a few decent size skis in there as well,just launch right at the dam and head right down the end of the lake where the deep hole is and work the edges !!!!"
741632,Sinker,2012-11-02 12:54:00,8692,"I've had a cottage in that area for twenty something years. If you want musky, head up to haliburton and fish head lake. You can get walleyes in there too. Pine lake, right in gooderham also has eyes. They're tricky to catch, but they are in there, and nice size fish too.  You'd probably have more fun fishing the put and take stocked trout lakes up there right now, that are open all year. This is the best time of year to fish specks and bows with an open all year season! Especially the bows!  S."
741637,jimmer,2012-11-02 13:18:00,2730,"That's a nice chunk of land Irishfield! Sorry you missed out on it.  I find the one thing that makes for a tough walleye/muskie bite in those lakes is the very clear water. An overcast day would help you and we have had plenty of them lately. Good luck, hope to see a positive report from you."
741825,Joeytier,2012-11-03 01:17:00,3990,No kidding.  Trout lakes galore in the area.  This is about the worst time to try and figure out a new lake for walleye and about the best time for year round specks and splake.
741826,Christopheraaron,2012-11-03 01:19:00,3525,Maybe a half trout half muskie day?
741831,Joeytier,2012-11-03 01:31:00,3990,"If you wanna smell bad for half the day, sure"
741836,Christopheraaron,2012-11-03 02:03:00,3525, As long as it's a fishy smell that'd be great!
741841,Musky or Specks,2012-11-03 02:45:00,2710,"Im going to second Head Lake for getting a ski. If there was one lake in the province I would guarantee a fish this would be it. Small enough for a canoe. try the bay with the down logs in it, other side of the lake from the town dock and then work your way back to the dock clockwise. Jerk baits will probably be the way to go and Ive had a lot of luck with jailbird suicks there."
741845,Christopheraaron,2012-11-03 03:13:00,3525,"Well, it was between head and 4 mile, I think head will be the ticket, team 4 just really needs a ski and we really need a shore lunch so I think it fits the bill, Thanks everyone! OFC comes through again."
741855,pics,2012-11-03 09:41:00,1268,"Loon Lake has muskie as well. As for Kinmount, you can boat up to 3 Brothers Falls for smaller ones. Some of the locals blame them for ruining the walleye fishing so they often get thrown up on shore. Just don't touch land for a pee. The inbreds that own the 1000 acres around there will come after you....."
741881,Christopheraaron,2012-11-03 13:42:00,3525,So just stand in the canoe and aim for shore?
