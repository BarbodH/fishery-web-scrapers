742121,davew3,2012-11-05 01:18:00,430,"So, was at Picton on Sat.  No envelopes for paying, nor an attendant.  So launched the boat along with everyone else and parked in the lot across the street.   Was out for 6 hours.  Skunked by the way.  Marking lots out  in front of the cement plant but no takers. So get back and pulled out the boat, get ready to go and notice a white piece of paper under my wiper.  A 2 day $20.00 bill for parking.  By the Picton Bay Marina !!  Thier notice says ""Fair is Fair"" I called and the lady says  "" we don't know how long you were there so that's the way it is ""  How many others got this?   Is this something new?  I will be calling Picton city hall Monday to see what this is about.  I was and am willing to pay the launch fee as stated at the ramp.  But if they do not have the materials or the staff why do they think they can just bill everyone $20.00 ?  I will post a follow up later.  Regards"

742195,Pickeral eater,2012-11-05 14:21:00,155,I got one as well. My buddy said everyone parked there got one.  Btw one pike for us over 2 days of fishing.
742219,SylvanOwner,2012-11-05 17:02:00,266," uh, maybe patrol and ticket vehicles in the lot every day???"
742220,davew3,2012-11-05 17:11:00,430,Well I just called the Town's recreation dept and it appears the lot does belong to the Tip of the Bay marina.  Even though it is not posted.  I recommended that he look into this.  I am still on the fence about paying this as I was only there 6 hours and they are billing for 2 days.  Regards
742226,ecmilley,2012-11-05 18:14:00,2163,don't pay really what can they do about it
742229,mike rousseau,2012-11-05 18:22:00,4661,Yeah what can they do...??? Stick it to em.....  Maybe next time they'll tow your vehicle.....
742231,Gerritt,2012-11-05 18:27:00,6129,its only 20 bucks.... pay it and consider it the next time you decide where to launch..  G
742236,superdad,2012-11-05 18:54:00,353,Hey there  I posted the fact of the $20.00 tickets at Picton Launch ramp and here are the replies from the people close to Picton  http://forum2.quintefishing.com/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=15398&sid=fedbab2715c3e3150ca94eb066f68efb  F Y I  David  aka  Superdad
742238,Roy,2012-11-05 19:23:00,13728,Thanks David. You're always helpful.
742245,camillj,2012-11-05 20:33:00,1988,Heh ... you should see what they charge at the airport
742249,Fish Farmer,2012-11-05 20:38:00,2234,"If that was the case, parking in the lot that belongs to the old Tip of The Bay building. That has nothing to do with the ramp parking lot or street."

742254,davew3,2012-11-05 20:43:00,430,The trucks parked on the side of the road pointing uphill got tagged as well.   Only those few who fit into the ramp parking lot did not.
742666,davew3,2012-11-08 15:54:00,430,"Well I am curious as to what happens this weekend.  I have been watching the posts on another site.  This should be interesting.  Good fishing everyone,  looks like decent weather on the way."
