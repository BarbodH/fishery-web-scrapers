742862,mike rousseau,2012-11-09 07:36:00,4661,I just read this ...  http://domino.city.cornwall.on.ca/Active/Development/egenda.nsf/965d04e85bb82eb4852573ae007b4532/dc20dfab4b6d2406852579510067df1f?OpenDocument
742863,fishindevil,2012-11-09 09:15:00,6254,Time to get Ron to weigh in on this issue ??  Is this in your area mike?? Sounds like a storm of backlash is a brewing....
742865,Rich,2012-11-09 10:18:00,3927,I went to school with the secretary who signed this! Lol
742868,Skipper D,2012-11-09 11:50:00,1970,"  It is in his area FD , and its a strech of about ten miles wide ......."
742871,bigugli,2012-11-09 12:18:00,6138,"For those that fish the area, time to pressure mayor and council. I've just sent my letter of displeasure."
742879,ccmtcanada,2012-11-09 13:44:00,7971,The document was dated in 2011 so it's been in effect for over a year already.
742881,Christopheraaron,2012-11-09 14:04:00,3525, Even if we're just finding it now that doesn't mean we should just stand by while they take away our rights?!
742892,mike rousseau,2012-11-09 15:19:00,4661,In all honesty I read the document and agree with it for the most part....  I've called the police several times because I couldn't launch my boat do to people swimming and loitering around the boat launch....  I do think this should be seasonal however.... Because the 2 marinas listed are popular fishing spots in the spring when boat traffic is at a minimum.... As well as ice fishing...   And the Eco park listed has a small man made stream that has created a fall spawning run for the few trout and salmon we have in the st Lawrence... And this bylaw will protect those fish...  The way this reads to me is it isn't city wide...  Just a few small locations that are really busy with boaters... And Cornwall literally has miles of public shoreline to fish...
742893,ccmtcanada,2012-11-09 15:30:00,7971," All I'm saying is that no one can weigh in on the passing of the by-law, since it's already done.  Ammendments can occur if they are willing to open the issue back up again.  Seems they perhaps snuck it through without anyone noticing!"
742900,kickingfrog,2012-11-09 16:54:00,8333,"""WHEREAS, fishing within the Rotary Eco Gardens is considered a public and environmental nuisance""  Come on. They might have legitimate reasons for these bylaws but surely some better wording could be used."
742941,Rich,2012-11-09 23:20:00,3927,"It is a nuisance when people start drinking, littering and vandalyzing while they're bored the fish aren't biting. Unfortunately i see it way too much. After these idiots show up, its wrecked for everybody."
