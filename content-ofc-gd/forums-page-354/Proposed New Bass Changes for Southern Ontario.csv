When you think of all the past introductions, intentional and accidental, and how long some of these species have lived in Ontario it does make you think about what native really means.  Non-natives are treated a little like second class citizens despite many have net positive effects."

I think we have to remember that New York has an early Bass  ""Trophy"" season with 1 as the limit. It's in the lake and there's lots of fishing beds too. Still, there's lots of big fish out there. Personally I think opening the season is good if someone actually knows it won't decimate the fish. It's probably good some places and damaging in others. Hopefully they open the places where it's all good."

741992,John Bacon,2012-11-04 02:05:00,3277, Introduced species may be more accurate. They were introduced into many Ontario lakes starting in the 1800's. There were very view lakes in Ontario that had bass populations prior to these stockings. The introductions happened so long ago that many assume that they were always here.

742020,fishindevil,2012-11-04 13:47:00,6254,In areas where there is a big goby population it should stay the same. !!!!

741529,Live2fish85,2012-11-01 23:44:00,1633, You are correct there. You are forgetting about places like the Niagara and Erie that have awesome bass fishing and the same spawn and so on we would. The fish off Myers don't seem to be affected to much and it is a zoo over there in early spring during spawn.
741530,Rich,2012-11-01 23:45:00,3927,Yes the growing season is several weeks longer on the east side of the niagara river

All through this time I catch and release a lot of Bass.  In NY State some lakes are open for ""Catch and Release Only"" prior to the regular opening.  I think this is a very good idea.  I don't eat Bass anyway, but I feel that this is a big first step in converting fish killer folk to the joys of CPR."
741704,jimmer,2012-11-02 17:31:00,2730,"This is the third time I have come into this thread to say something only to delete what I wrote. I will just ask, do we really need an extra week if there is any chance it will jeopardize another population of fish, especially in the Kawarthas? Why mess with it? Yes the bass are booming right now, but that can change quickly. Ten years ago the walleye were booming, I can't say that about them now. (See very few small fish now)"
741714,SmokestackLightnin,2012-11-02 18:27:00,390," Overharvesting and habitat loss led to the change in the walleye.  I don't see that as an issue for the bass.  The resource could probably sustain an earlier opener or even a C&R season.  And don't forget they are not just proposing an earlier season start in 17, 18 and 20.  But also a later close in 18 and 20 which holds some very fine, if not some of the best bass waters in the province."
741731,jimmer,2012-11-02 19:29:00,2730,"I could accept an early C & R, but this summer I saw more than usual being kept to replace the lack of success with walleye. People love to eat fish and if the walleye aren't there in numbers they will switch their target, which is well within their rights. It just really concerns me to extend the season earlier."
741735,Rod Caster,2012-11-02 19:48:00,5784,"Go ahead and open them year round in Zone 11 ...other than a small cross section of people (Parents with small kids, Tourneys and C&R guys) most people don't fish for bass at all. ...and why the heck are bass closed during the winter in the first place??? I've heard of maybe two people accidentally catching bass on the ice and you can bet bass would not get a lot of ice fishing pressure even if open season.  The only bass people really keep up here are white bass and they are not even listed as a sport fish in Zone 11! haha, and from what I understand they are actually natural to Lake Nipissing!  Darn SMB have ruined some of the lakes up here, including some trout streams in Algonquin park which are quickly slipping away, so I'm not too keen on them... why would a desireable fish like splake/rainbows be open all year and bass are closed during winter when people don't target them anyway...haha, seems so stupid to me.  I can understand wanting more restrictions in south and/or Ottawa area regions, because of the much higher fishing pressure towards all species, but anywhere north of haliburton??  "
741739,SmokestackLightnin,2012-11-02 19:59:00,390," For splake it's because they are a ""put and take"" species."

741456,Joeytier,2012-11-01 21:23:00,3990,"That was an informative read.  I would definitely back a year round season, but given their economic importance that will never happen."

741458,Live2fish85,2012-11-01 21:33:00,1633,I don't think a year round season would hurt the bass at all. It has worked in the state's without any real problems.
741461,BillM,2012-11-01 21:40:00,17367," The US has a lot longer of a growing season then we do up here.  I don't think opening bass all year would be a good idea, but a week or two earlier then it is now most likely wouldn't hurt anything."
741463,Christopheraaron,2012-11-01 21:42:00,3525," it works in new york too though, i guess close them to ice fishing and have a year long softwater season?"
741464,ecmilley,2012-11-01 21:43:00,2163,actually I think an all round open season would have economic benefits for most of ontario and  would help walleye populations in certain areas but given I now have an open all year panny fishery and decent walleye/bass/musky on my lake.  i am thrilled to get the edge off a week earlier for bass
741466,ecmilley,2012-11-01 21:48:00,2163,"i agree with the week or two, but longer growing season can be in debate, carolina has a longer grow but new york is marginal, central/southerontario grow season is longer or the same as wisconsin or minnisota but also research has proved that shorter growing seasons translate to longer life in fish so it would be a case of 6 of one 1/2 doz of the other, i think lake champlain could be a model for central/soouthern ontario bass fishing"
