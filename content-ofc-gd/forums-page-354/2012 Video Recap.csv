Lots of boat problems this year prevented me from fishing as frequently and put guiding to a halt.  I still got out lots and made lots of memories before calling it an early year. Here's a video recap of my season, enjoy!  http://youtu.be/NRVxKtBjl4A"

742269,Roy,2012-11-05 22:18:00,13728,Great report Steve. Sorry to hear about your boat problems but we all know tons of guys who had no boat problems at all and didn't catch one tenth the quality fish you caught. Keep at it....you're an inspiration to lots of folks and thanks for sharing your 2012 recap.
