742107,hotsky,2012-11-05 00:25:00,400,Just came from Binbrook a little earlier and man the water was like pea soup! Zero viability couldn't even see my lure inches under water. Not surprising after all the rain we had I guess...  Does everything look like that right now? I was planning on trying out a new lake about an hour away and would hate to go there for nothing.
