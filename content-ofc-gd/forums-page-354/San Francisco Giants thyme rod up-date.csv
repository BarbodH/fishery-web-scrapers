Thank goodness for cheap Yankee beer...hahaha.  A couple of weeks ago I shared some pictures of a new rod with a San Francisco Giants theme.  Since then it has been out fishing, and caught several fish, while awaiting some art work that was out of stock.  Last night it got finished off.  Inlaid logo in butt cap...    SF Giants logo inlaid on fore grip.    Tiger wrap detail     My friend is almost as happy with the new rod as with her team's World Series win!"

742634,Garry2Rs,2012-11-08 03:47:00,1425,"Thanks guys.  I have a new green coloured Tiger Wrap in the works.  It's on a 6'6"" Medium weight (783) Spin-Jig blank, rated for 8 to 15 lb. line and 3/16 to 5/8 oz. baits. This rod will feature the new Micro-Wave spinning guide system and a new style of one-foot hook keeper.  So far I have turned and installed the cork grips and finished the decorative wraps.  The missing parts should arrive early next week.  This might be my prettiest rod yet! I will post pictures when it's finished. Garry"
