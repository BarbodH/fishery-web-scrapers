Co-hosted by the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence Cities Initiative and the Canada-Ontario Invasive Species Centre, the Forum is in response to growing public concerns about the risk of Asian carp establishing in the Great Lakes.  ""The potential threat to the health of our shared Great Lakes from the invasion of Asian carp cannot be countered effectively by any one jurisdiction,"" said Hon.

Key players from the U.S. and Canada will discuss Asian carp control strategies, the nature and extent of the issue, current efforts to stop migration, planning for the future, and what individuals can do to stop the introduction of Asian carp to the Great Lakes.  ""The Great Lakes represent an important economic and cultural asset for Canada and the United States. We are firmly committed to working together with our partners to protect this ecosystem and the industries and individuals who depend on it,"" said Hon. Minister Gail Shea of Fisheries and Oceans Canada. ""As Asian carp are not yet established in the Great Lakes, we are taking action now to prevent their introduction into the Great Lakes in the future"".
