Sourced from http://www.nugget.ca/2012/11/07/a-hunters-dream  A pair of local hunters have their sights set on hosting their own show on the Wild TV network.  Nipissing Township residents Michael Taylor and Shaun Leduc will be competing against teams of hunters from across the country for free air time and the chance to launch their own show on The Search, a reality television show set to air in the spring.  “It's an opportunity of a lifetime,” said Taylor, 49, an avid outdoorsman who wants to showcase Northern Ontario hunting to the rest of Canada.  With footage shot and presented by the contestants, The Search will feature various hunts by multiple people in different parts of Canada.  Taylor and Leduc, who call themselves the Northern Assailants, will compete against teams such as Prairie Assassins, Team Prairie Storm, Team Killbilies, Outlaw Outdoors, and The Replacements. And the two have been busy this fall filming bear, moose and deer hunts in preparation for the show.  Taylor said it's been a labour of love for the two who consider hunting a lifestyle. And he said they hope to showcase that in their footage, showing the highs and lows of the sport and how it's an activity involving friends and family.  “It has been a dream of mine for many years to be one of the pro hunters you see on TV -- living a hunter's dream,” said Leduc, 34, noting The Search is an opportunity for the two to break into a hard-to-crack industry. “I've been following hunters like Michael Waddell and would love to be a full time hunter/guide in the future. Even a pro camera man would be great.”  The winner of the show will receive a quarter of airtime at no charge from Wild TV to get their own show going. Viewers will help decide who wins by going online to vote for their favourite team. According to the show's website, 50% the votes will come from viewers and 50% of the vote will be done by special guest judges that are involved in the outdoor industry. The Search is produced by Nature Productions Canada, which shows include Hitmen Canada and The Bear Whisperer.  Both Taylor and Leduc hope their brand of hunting will resonate with television audiences and they're asking for local support through online votes when the show airs in the spring, plus any sponsorships to help offset related to filming and travel.
