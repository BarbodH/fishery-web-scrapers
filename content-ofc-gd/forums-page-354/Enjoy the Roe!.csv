742433,alexmedic,2012-11-07 00:44:00,186,"It is amazing what one step can mean.  Today while fishing the notty, I quickly learned that 1 step in muddy waters can make the thigh high water, become chest high!  After i caught myself and quickly waded to shallower water, I watched two full roe containers drift down the river.  So if anyone comes across a container full of rainbow roe or a container full of salmon roe - enjoy!  Unfortunately my secret added touch to each sac is now out there for discovery  But on the bright side, I'm still alive.  Be careful out there, the undercurrent is crazy right now!"
742434,BillM,2012-11-07 00:46:00,17367,"I've gone for a swim in that river on more then one occasion.  When it blows out, it creates a whole bunch of new holes"
742450,ketchenany,2012-11-07 01:53:00,3229,"memeories of a dear friend floating down the Bighead in November, yelling, save my rod! Waders filled with water is not the best thing at this time of year."
742451,SirCranksalot,2012-11-07 02:10:00,3291,I like on the river. I'll keep my eyes open!! Thx for the tip!
742474,kemper,2012-11-07 05:40:00,2232,I've taken a swim in most of the bigger systems up North. Not enjoyable.  Although my last swim in the Saugeen was a complete hoot for those across from me. I'll remember to set the hook with less aggression next time I'm standing on a rock in waist deep water...
742481,misfish,2012-11-07 10:00:00,29133,"Glad to hear you got out of that. I did it as well. The water was so cold. Scary stuff.  And ya,the water is pretty fast right now."
742482,Twocoda,2012-11-07 11:05:00,4130,Note to Ten90- Take roe out of containers before chumming  Still a Notty virgin if you didnt get your willy wet
742494,alexmedic,2012-11-07 13:35:00,186,"Definitely a close call.  I figured by now the roe is somewhere out in Georgian Bay!  A few seasons ago, I recieved this as a Father's Day gift: http://www.llbean.com/llb/shop/36466?feat=sr&term=wading%20staff  I never really used it until yesterday, but man I was glad to have it.  BPS makes their own version now.  Much cheaper, but I could not comment on the quality .."
742496,misfish,2012-11-07 13:51:00,29133,"Old ski pole, does the trick as well."
742497,BillM,2012-11-07 13:57:00,17367," Yup, make sure you get a cross country ski pole, longer then the downhill versions."
742501,kemper,2012-11-07 14:14:00,2232,"Sail in Oshawa has extend-able hiking poles on for $20 right now, and they come in a 2 pack.  For 10 bucks each my buddy and I both got a wading staff, and that makes the $100+ Simms model even more hilarious."
742505,Roe Bag,2012-11-07 14:28:00,246,My ski pole cost me a swim in the Saugeen. I was fighting a fish and turned to walk out toward the bank. Didn't realize it but it was tethered to my belt and dangling diagonally across my shins just below my knees. Feet got tangled up in it and down I went. Rod in the air with one hand and doin' the sidestroke with the other. Not a nice place to be.  On the oher hand it has proved it's worth many times over on lots of other occasions.  Don't leave home without it!
742516,SirCranksalot,2012-11-07 16:10:00,3291,"Some folks wear an automatically inflating PFD when wading deep rivers. (With the rocks on the Bighead a hardhat might be a better idea, lest you get a big head)"
742517,kemper,2012-11-07 16:18:00,2232," I went head first into the Biggie last December. Not a fun thing to do, and made me realize really quickly that my gear was sub-par. I was lucky, and righted myself quickly before I get into deep trouble but I could have just as easily cranked my head on a rock and taken the long swim.  Now I wear a wading belt on my waders, a second belt on my jacket, carry a staff, and my cuffs are as tight as possible whenever I wade bigger water. This proved to be a good strategy during my Saugeen swim this year."
742524,Twocoda,2012-11-07 17:54:00,4130, Ill bring the camera ...let me know when your fishing on the Geen again....i absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE the entertainment of the water folies (fallies)..sometimes more fun then fishing...
742531,FishTracker,2012-11-07 19:17:00,47, Thanks for the tip!  I'll check out the Sail in Burlington to see what they have.
742536,kemper,2012-11-07 19:54:00,2232," Would have liked this one - set the hook into a good fish while I was standing on a rock in fairly deep water. I was using the pull of the fish to stay balanced on the rock, until the fish came right at me  Went backwards like a falling tree"
742537,misfish,2012-11-07 20:09:00,29133,  Sounds like a great place to go and take vids and do a documentary .
742572,Twocoda,2012-11-07 22:19:00,4130, i would be lying if i said it never happens to me...but just the other day a guy did a somersault in the current while trying to walk out to the rockpile...(no camera)   i just love the look on their faces when they get up to see if anyone saw what just happened...my recent fall wasnt that bad...i changed to my studded waders and had super grip on everything i stepped on so it gave me a great sense of security and confidence that I didnt have to look down to see where i was walking (water was dirty) well i tripped over the largest bolder in the river and went forward... both arms up to my pits got soaked...and of course EVERYONE was standing watching...
