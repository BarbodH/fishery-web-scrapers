I didnt expect them to shine here in open water because the conditions that exist in the southern US that made them huge dont apply here for the most part but I bet they will be deadly through the ice,just bend the wires out,thoughts people?"
742380,BucktownAngler,2012-11-06 21:42:00,582,not much different then a spreader  
742396,Handlebarz,2012-11-06 22:34:00,3790,Will be killer on perch use 4 with minnows and small spoons on the others
742410,BillM,2012-11-06 23:22:00,17367,I expect a lot of tangles.
742422,Freshtrax,2012-11-06 23:58:00,2215,I bet the lakers would come from miles to inspect.
742438,hirk,2012-11-07 01:07:00,571,Im thinking it would fish much different than a spreader because of the swivels and longer arms.Im think it might make a great slow jigging setup
