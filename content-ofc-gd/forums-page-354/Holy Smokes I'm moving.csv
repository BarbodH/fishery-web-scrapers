741622,Rizzo,2012-11-02 12:01:00,4754,"Well, we're leaving Barrie area, moving to Kitchener for work. Around here I've enjoyed hitting quarries a couple of times a summer to catch the odd pike or bass with my kids. If anyone were willing to pm me any quarry tips for the Kitchener area my kids would love you. I see there are a lot of them out that way, and since I have limited time to test them out, any hints would be appreciated. Anyone who wants to know any little secrets around Barrie feel free to pm me and I'll help where I can."
741626,Christopheraaron,2012-11-02 12:16:00,3525,"Well theres bloomingdale ponds but really they are almost dead, someone will help you out I'm sure."
741627,lew,2012-11-02 12:20:00,12766,"Good luck with the move Roger, guess you won't be spending much time chasing muskies around these parts anymore ??"
741634,misfish,2012-11-02 13:09:00,29133,"Roger,is there a better flow of customers out that way?  Best of luck to you and your family."
741642,Canuck2fan,2012-11-02 13:45:00,1444,"Kitchener area has lots of river fishing close by, kids will have no problem catching ""something"" in a lot of spots... And you are only about 1.5hrs or less from some of the best steelheading, perch and bass fishing in the province on 3 of the Great Lakes."
741647,SirCranksalot,2012-11-02 14:16:00,3291,"My buddy and I floated down the Grand near Glen Morris a few years ago and had the best bass fishing ever. I think we caught around 25 in a few hours, some goo ones too."
741711,SlowPoke,2012-11-02 18:06:00,2984,"Great news Roger, I hope we can hook-up sometime!"
741712,Rizzo,2012-11-02 18:21:00,4754," ...sad but true Lew. We will likely still make the drive to Pigeon once or twice a year, but I'll have to come up with a different plan. I'll let you know when we're going to be there!"
741774,Rizzo,2012-11-02 22:26:00,4754, ...oh Brian...I'll miss you
741851,glen,2012-11-03 04:47:00,2641,Good luck with your move Rizzo. I have enjoyed your posts from up here.
741856,Handlebarz,2012-11-03 10:25:00,3790,Roger since you will not be heading up there fishing with Lew you can come down to LSC and have a seat in my boat
741872,Rizzo,2012-11-03 12:28:00,4754,"now you're talking Mike! Maybe I can ride shotgun with you until I can upgrade my own boat. Currently I have a lighter weight Princecraft (162 s/c with a 50) that I worry might be a little light for LSC. And with SlowPokes offer I'm sure I'll be back catching toothy esox in no time. Speaking of which, when does season end down there...we move on dec 14th. If closing is the 15th I'm sure my wife would LOVE it if I went fishing instead of unpacking. Last year I ""unwinterized"" the boat just before closing, broke through an inch of ice for about 100 feet to reach open water but closed the season with a 46 incher on Balsam)"
742075,Handlebarz,2012-11-04 21:06:00,3790,15th is closer I hope to get out if there is open water. It's been many years since I on Dec 15th
742097,nofish4me,2012-11-04 23:06:00,404,"Just figure on adding 1.5 hrs to get to your favourite spot, and go anyway.  Unless your favourite spot was south of Barrie."
