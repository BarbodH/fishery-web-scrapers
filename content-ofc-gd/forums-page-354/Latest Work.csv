A couple months ago I built a 9wt Rainshadow spey rod, which is a pleasure to fish but an absolute beast in anything but the biggest flows in Ontario. This got me thinking, and I decided to add a 6wt to the stable.  I'm still a long way from being on par with some of the builders on here, but I think the build quality on this one is much improved from where I have been.            The dust is on the wraps, not in them...    Stay tuned, a spey conversion as well as a float rod rebuild are in the works as well.  Cheers,  Kemper"
