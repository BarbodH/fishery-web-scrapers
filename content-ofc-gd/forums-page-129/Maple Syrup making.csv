965589,Sinker,2016-04-07 12:56:00,8692,I should get a sap tsunami here today. Hoping anyways.  S.
966293,moose,2016-04-13 15:10:00,266,Collected 230 litres of sap yesterday as trees started to run again
966324,Rod Caster,2016-04-13 20:52:00,5784,"Yep, started up again today as well. Hoping for a flood over next week"
966354,Sinker,2016-04-14 02:16:00,8692,I finished 6 more litres on sunday. Iys slowed down around here but its still flowing ok on my bush trees. I should have enough for one more boil by end of week then taps are coming out. Im over 40 litrs finished now..... sick of it now lol   S.
966629,north560,2016-04-16 14:22:00,38,"My trees are starting to run now, got 4gals of sap yesterday, time to start cutting the dead trees around the house for wood for the stove then we can start to boil."
966630,Sinker,2016-04-16 16:22:00,8692,Its still running down here too. It just won't stop!!! I have 320l of sap boiled down to about 70 but I have been working so haven't had time to finish it.  Make it stop!!!  S.
966658,Rod Caster,2016-04-16 20:44:00,5784,"Ha! That's crazy! I'll pot an update tomorrow, no time right now"
966710,Rod Caster,2016-04-17 12:37:00,5784,"I'm gonna go collect this morning to boil down what's left of approx. 220L ( I par-boiled some the other day). There is still a lot snow in the bush, and some trees are really pushing out the sap still. My goal was 15-20 L of syrup, I'm at 11, and should get at least 5-6L from this boil, so I'm in the wheelhouse and very happy with be season and how much I've learned. Everyone says it's been a great year for syrup, so hurray for that.  Funny though, some trees actually stopped running on the first real nice day, even with -2 at night. They just shut down and I don't get it. With the crazy nice temps, I feel like the trees should be winding down as of today, but I would never have thought, that with perfect temperature swings, and 2 feet of snow in places in the bush, that the trees would be shutting down. Especially with the southern guys just finishing up now, I should be 1 or 2 weeks behind.  Some of my trees were tapped before March 15th, has anyone experienced trees self-healing?? I feel like if I drill a new hole, the tree will start running again, but then again I don't want to drill a hole for nothing or risk injuring the tree. The first year I did this, I drilled the trees in early march, and when the run started, the trees were seemingly choked back, so I re-drilled a few, and pow! the sap flowed great. Any thoughts on this?"
966722,moose,2016-04-17 17:55:00,266,we pulled our taps yesterday after collectng over a 1000 litres of syrup tues to yest and the boil hac been none stop we boiled around 4500 litres and 100 plus litres of syrup
966728,Sinker,2016-04-17 18:47:00,8692,Nice! Where are you located?

966780,Rod Caster,2016-04-18 12:19:00,5784,"My second batch, was very light, much lighter than the 5 previous batches. ...???"
966887,Sinker,2016-04-19 02:07:00,8692,"There are a ton of reasons for colour.  I just finished my last 4 litres.   DONE!!  lost count of the final tally, but somewhere around 45 litres from 46 taps. Great season but glad its over!! I still have a bunch of work to do cleaning up gear and storing it all away.  S."
966958,Rod Caster,2016-04-19 17:49:00,5784,That's a great return for 46 taps. I'm at 20 for 34 so far. Im not sure if the trees still have any sap left in them. Will find out later today
966971,Sinker,2016-04-19 19:34:00,8692,"Turns out it was only 44 taps. LOL.....either that or I missed a few on pack up. Regardless, 44 buckets are cleaned, dried and put away for next year.  S."
967745,north560,2016-04-26 13:34:00,38,Finally the sap is running getting 4gals per day hopefully by Saturday can start to boil and pull the taps.About time.
964437,Sinker,2016-03-30 11:02:00,8692,Its been going crazy here. Over 500l in 36 hrs!!
964438,moose,2016-03-30 11:31:00,266,Sap has been running non stop since Saturday  night Running out of storage while boil go on Strapped battles to atv to collect sap In horseshoe valley area
964441,SmokestackLightnin,2016-03-30 12:01:00,390,Running like crazy here too.
964469,Sinker,2016-03-30 16:20:00,8692,"Ive been boiling non stop since monday. I have all my storage containers empty now and in the pan, so ready for tonights collection. Ive lost count of how much syrup ive made but im around 18 or so litres. Looks like lots more to come."

964478,Rod Caster,2016-03-30 17:26:00,5784,I'm boiling today. Looking for another 3 or 4 litres of syrup ...total should be around 7 litres so far this year.  It's running good but the rain and upcoming cold will once again slow things down... I'm pretty such the peak of the run hasn't started yet here
964543,Rod Caster,2016-03-30 23:49:00,5784,Do you guys ask restaurants to save pails for you? One of the country styles puts their buckets beside their dumpster and I pick 'em up. All food grade and free. Dumpster diving isn't just for raccoons. So far they've given me nearly 30 pails
964544,crappieperchhunter,2016-03-30 23:56:00,2582,Do you guys ask restaurants to save pails for you? One of the country styles puts their buckets beside their dumpster and I pick 'em up. All food grade and free. Dumpster diving isn't just for raccoons. So far they've given me nearly 30 pails  Good idea. I used to do a lot of carp fishing and needed buckets for my feed. Kawartha Dairy in Bobcaygeon gave me all the food grade buckets I needed just for asking. Maybe some syrup guys could squirrel some as well.
964647,Sinker,2016-03-31 17:55:00,8692,"So in 4 days I've finished 16 litres. I have 160l boiled down to about 50 litres now. Have to finish that tonight.  25.5 litres finished, might have 30 after tonights finish.  I need a break. I hope it doesn't run for a few days!!  S."
964689,Rod Caster,2016-03-31 22:35:00,5784,"I just finished 7L of fairly light coloured syrup, down from approx 220L of sap. I'm very pleased and surprised at that ratio. I wonder if my de-icing of the buckets helped"
964720,Sinker,2016-04-01 02:54:00,8692,Skimming ice will help for sure. That is a really good yeild. How are you dtermining when its syrup?  I collected another 180l tonight. Just make it stop already!!!  I have boiled thru 220l and just keep adding. 20l/hr. I will have a mega batch when im done. 340 litres of sap in one boil.  S.
964740,Rod Caster,2016-04-01 12:35:00,5784,"20l/hr. That's a good boil down rate. I was getting closer to 10. For the next boil I'm going get my rocket stove up and running, and double boil.   I use a hydrometer with the Baume and Brix reading. Last year I estimated/calculated I was getting close to 35:1 ratio. Maybe some trees have better concentrations of sugar???"
964804,Sinker,2016-04-01 17:54:00,8692,"Oh yeah, the yeild varies all the time. Sometimes I get 33:1, other times I get 40:1.....You can get a device to measure sugar content as well. I haven't gone that high tech yet though....lol.....I use a thermometer and a hydrometer, but I can get it really close by eye. The hydrometer doesn't lie though.  The hardest part for me is filtering. I had a few batches this year that I filtered too hot and ended up with a layer of ""sludge"" on the bottoms of the bottles after it settled out for a couple days. I don't care myself, its harmless, but I don't like giving that stuff away, so I re did those batches. If you filter above 190 degrees the syrup can still create nitre (maple sand) after its been filtered, so I let it cool to 190 before I filter. It takes a little longer to get thru the filter, but it comes out crystal clear every time.  What are you using for a filter? I use a wool ( or felt, whatever it is) bucket filter with 3-5 pre-filters. Once it starts getting clogged up I remove a prefilter, and keep removing them until its all through the filter. I find the bucket filter works a lot better than the cone filter....for me anyways. The cone filter always gets clogged up sooner than the bucket filter.  Anyways, just filled all my propane tanks....again....off to boiling lol  EDIT: I meant to say that I have tried using two burners, but for whatever reason I still get the same evaporation rate, so I just stick to the one heavy duty burner and use A LOT less propane. I had it figured to about 1 tank per 300l of sap. That's pretty efficient for propane I think. What are you boiling in?    S."
964900,SmokestackLightnin,2016-04-02 14:17:00,390,"I use a felt cone filter, I purchase a new one every year at Atkinson's.  I think I will try a bucket filter next year as the cone filter does clog up, but it's efficient.  Also line it with 2 layers of pre-filters.  Does a decent job but I also filter it when it's hot so I get the sugar sand at the bottom of the jar.  Adds character is what I say, you know it's not commercially made then."

I had it figured to about 1 tank per 300l of sap. That's pretty efficient for propane I think. What are you boiling in?    S.   Filtering is starting to be an issue for me, only because I'm getting better at this and clarity is starting to matter for me. I use the woven with paper pre-filters and try to pass the sap through it as many times as possible throughout the boiling stages. I didn't know about the 'hot' filtering issue, so that's great info! I'll use that.  The best way I found for removing the sediment, is to leave the batch sit overnight, then decant off. Wow, does that eliminate a lot of impurities and it's super simple. I transfered very clean sap (from 220L boiled to 10L) into my finishing pot after an overnight sit and the batch turned out very clear, but I still found some white/foggy deposit , different than the grey/brown sand I normally get. I suppose I should have cold filtered before I transfered to my finishing pot. Can you filter the syrup just before or just after it's complete, or will it just stick to the filter??  For boiling, I have a 50L stock pot and a 65,000BTU banjo style burner. I find it uses too much propane, but I need to do calculations to find the optimum fill level, otherwise I overfill it and it slows down the rate. It's all about air-surface area ratio, so I've read. I'll sometimes use a second turkey boiler and a 20L pot if I want to double my rate.  Also...I've been playing with a rocket stove I built last summer. Take a look at the pics. After a couple adjustments, it easily boils the 20L stock pot and I feed it with small sticks. Nice and easy and cheap! I hope to eventually boil everything down using rocket stoves              First batch on the right, it never settled. The second batch on the left settled very nicely the next day. I can't figure out why the earlier batch is darker!? "
964906,Sinker,2016-04-02 15:09:00,8692,"Filtering between boils is a waste of time. I've learned that the hard way. One filter at the very end at the right temperature is all it takes to get perfectly clear syrup every time. I used to waste time filtering all the time too, and it did nothing to help clear up the syrup. Boil your sap until its syrup with no filtering, let it cool to 190 degrees and then filter it once with the prefilters and wool filter, removing prefilters as they clog. The cloudy stuff you are getting is nitre, and is formed most when closest to syrup, but only at temps above 190 degrees.  When I collect I pour my sap through a funnel with a very fine screen into water jugs, then boil, and filter the final product once when it is finished syrup.  I find if I get a full pan (100l), and boil it all in one shot, my syrup comes out the lightest, and clearest. If I keep adding it gets darker. I like the dark stuff myself, but right now i am adding to my boil because I have way too much sap to deal with. I am afraid to even look at my buckets today LOL.  Evaporation rates are all about surface area and heat. The larger the surface area, and more heat, makes for the best evap rate. I use a 2ft x 2ft square pan that is 12"" deep. One burner is most efficient for me for propane use. I add 20l to the pan every hour or so. Since I boil in my garage, I put a big fan by the pan to blow the steam out the garage door, and it seems to help with evaporating as well. I have had people stop and knock on my door thinking I have a fire in my garage several times LOL  I can't believe the snow you guys have there....wow.....looks like you have plenty of season left there!!  Great pics! That rocket stove looks interesting too. Add a small blower to that and you would have some serious heat!!  S."
964907,Sinker,2016-04-02 15:12:00,8692,"I don't care about the skim at the bottom of the bottles either. Its perfectly safe, and probably healthier too lol  I really find the bucket filter works better for small batches. The flat bottom seems to make a big difference.  And yes, if you filter at a lower temperature, you will have nice clear syrup every time. Try it.  S."
964909,Sinker,2016-04-02 15:15:00,8692,"Another trick I use is to put a grate over my pan, and sit my propane tank in the steam. The steam keeps the tanks from icing up, and makes a much, much better burn. You can also keep the tanks in a container of warm water to prevent ice up. Once they ice up, you lose a lot of BTU's.  S."
965317,Sinker,2016-04-05 13:51:00,8692,"Finished 7 more litres last night. Nice dark thick batch.  Getting a break now. Might get a bit of sap this week, but daytime temps aren't quite warm enough.  S."
965427,north560,2016-04-06 15:04:00,38,"My sap is at a stop weather too cold maybe this coming week, 16 taps and only 5gals collected so far that won't even give me 1 qt after boil down."
965512,Rod Caster,2016-04-06 22:57:00,5784,"Even with the cold my trees are weeping. I'm thinking next week, when it warms up, I'll be scrambling to keep up"
965528,cheaptackle,2016-04-06 23:47:00,849,"Well of course they're weeping - some guy keeps punching holes in 'em, you'd weep too! Sounds like ya need to start selling some at the end of your driveway.  Michael"
965536,Rod Caster,2016-04-07 00:23:00,5784,"Ha!! Don't get all tree-hugger on us   The end of my driveway is actually the worst spot to sell anything, I get one or two cars per month driving by house"
965538,cheaptackle,2016-04-07 00:32:00,849,"Me? Tree hugger? When both arms were working I was the nastiest dude with a chainsaw y'all ever did see! But I took 'em down quick like, didn't torture 'em punching all those holes in 'em, humane that's me. It's gonna be interesting to read how much you get on the next cycle - it's almost as if you're getting a double season this year the way the weather's been. Next time I see ya you'll probably weigh in around 300 lbs after swabbin' up all that syrup with pancakes, waffles...  Michael"
962281,Rod Caster,2016-03-13 13:30:00,5784,"It ran great yesterday. 34 buckets out by 2pm, over 20L of sap. I expect better today... gonna be a beautiful day!"
962447,Sinker,2016-03-14 13:57:00,8692,"I was away the last 5 days, but had a friend collect my sap. I wasn't expecting anything because the over night lows didn't look low enough, but I came home to 200l collected, and still have a lot of buckets on trees that are half full. I'm hoping to get another 100l when I collect tonight.  So far have only boiled once. 100l that yeilded 2.5L of syrup. Nice golden colour to it though. Love the first batch!  I will be boiling the next two days non stop.  S."
962911,Sinker,2016-03-17 19:12:00,8692,"Total so far is 9 litres finished. I'm hoping this weekend will bring one more good run so I can get up to my usual 15 or so litres. Keep in mind I doubled my taps this year, and I am running way lower on sap collection. Not a good year by any standards for my area.  How's everyone else making out??  You northern guys should be ok I would think? No?  S."
962912,Joeytier,2016-03-17 19:41:00,3990,"-10 tonight, -16 tomorrow night so it'll be shut down for the weekend."
962913,Sinker,2016-03-17 19:54:00,8692,No daytimes above zero?
962917,Rod Caster,2016-03-17 20:56:00,5784,"From 34 taps Ive collected just over 100L thus far.  The cold will stop it for a bit before the real run starts. It looks like it'll be a good year. I'm hoping for 10L minimum, 15 or more if the season is extended"
963207,Rod Caster,2016-03-20 13:18:00,5784,"Boiled down 100L yesterday. Finishing it up this morning and hoping for 2.5 to 3.5 L of syrup. We have LOTS of season left! Even at -1 daytime temp, the sap is running and we still have 2 feet of snow out there."
963209,Sinker,2016-03-20 13:42:00,8692,Not much happening here. Daytime highs aren't quite high enough to get a good run. Slow and steady day by day. Hope to have enough for a good boil next weekend. Looks like it may keep flowing for a while down here now. The weather forcast keeps changing in my favour.  S.
963214,Rod Caster,2016-03-20 14:49:00,5784,"Good, you were worried it would be a short season. You may end up doing well  Do you guys maintain the forest, ie manage the trees for optimum  growth and sunlight exposure?"
963221,Sinker,2016-03-20 15:27:00,8692,"No....well, not yet.  This is my first year in this bush. Its a friend of mines place, that I kind of got addicted to the whole maple syrup thing. We have big plans for next year. Its a 10 acre bush. Hoping for 2-300 taps next year and a new evaporator. 6x2 Lapierre wood fired. Right now we have 146 taps on buckets with a 4x2 flat pan on propane, and a 2x2 finishing pan on propane. Gotta get wood fired next year for sure. Been saying it for years now lol  S."
963357,north560,2016-03-21 13:33:00,38,"Well the cold weather has shut down my trees, no sap for 3 days only 3 gallons of sap so far. Hope it gets better weather soon as we will be busy with other jobs soon."
963381,Sinker,2016-03-21 17:14:00,8692,"Same here. Shut down. I get a little sap at mid day for maybe an hour or two but not enough to bother collecting,and only the sunny trees. Kinda sucks. I was hoping to be going crazy this week with sap, but its not happening.  I've finished 9l of syrup and have no sap at the moment.  S."
963416,Rod Caster,2016-03-22 01:06:00,5784,"Cold attacked us too. Same as Sinker, my trees run for a couple hours if they are exposed to the sun. We got 3L from 110l of sap, then a jar broke and we ended up with 2.5L.  What do you guys get for an evaporation rate? I got around 7L per hr. My propane tanks kept freezing up so my burner didn't run at optimum all day"
963465,Sinker,2016-03-22 12:47:00,8692,"I get about 16l/h on mine, but I put a grate over top of my boiling pan and keep my propane tank on top of the rack to keep it warm. It makes a HUUUGE difference. I also have a really good burner. Its a really old one, but it pounds out heat. I wish I knew how many BTU's it was, because any of the new ones I've bought don't even compare. I can fill my pan with 100L and finish it on one tank of propane easily. So for about 15 bucks I make about 2.5L of syrup.    S."
963467,Rod Caster,2016-03-22 12:54:00,5784,"That's really good. I clearly need to watch for freezing tanks then  I picked up a burner base that has a banjo style burner and is 65,000 BTU. When it goes it goes but I also need to keep my 50L pot less full to get optimum evap."
963469,north560,2016-03-22 13:07:00,38,"We boil the old fashioned way, we have a wood stove made from a water tank someone welded a square frame on the top just big enough to fit a big roast pan on it works great and you clean up all those dead trees around the yard."
963473,SmokestackLightnin,2016-03-22 13:24:00,390,"This year I put out 40 taps and they have stopped flowing here as well.  So far I have done 2 boils of around 450 litres of sap and bottled almost 15 litres of syrup. I use a propane fueled 3 burner camp stove.  I have a 300 litre stainless steel evaporator and a shelf right below for the propane burner.  I finish on a single burner and a large stainless steel pot.  Couple of notes regarding this year, first quite a bit of sediment in the sap.  I filtered twice and still had small amounts of sugar sand in each jar of syrup.  Good news is that it has settle to the bottom of the jar and is not affecting the syrup.  Second, a nice amber syrup so far this year, great flavor and as always really sweet.  It makes it all worth it when you taste the final product.  Hopefully 1 more run for me so that I can get some darker syrup that I use in marinades, sauces and brine for smoking.  Good luck to those doing syrup this year. "
963477,Sinker,2016-03-22 13:47:00,8692,"Filtering is always a PITA for me.  I did one batch this year, ran it thru my wool filter with 3 prefilters. The 4 litres that came through were bottled, the rest that didn't come thru I put back in the pot, and cleaned my filter, 3 new pre filters and ran it through again. The first batch had maple sand, the second didn't. Weird stuff.  The first batch I did, 100l of sap, made almost 3l of syrup that was almost like honey. Beautiful stuff, and no problem filtering it.  S."
963718,Rod Caster,2016-03-23 23:51:00,5784,"Have any of you guys tried your hands at birch syrup? I heard the sap runs fast, I might collect some just for a few drinks of the sap."

964221,Sinker,2016-03-28 19:41:00,8692,Wow....sap overload here now. Collected 280 litres in the last 24 hours.....and its still running like crazy. This season is turning out to be much better than i thought and its a nice slow and steady pace.....until now lol
964227,SmokestackLightnin,2016-03-28 21:19:00,390,"This weekend was a boomer.  Overrun with sap now, boiled like crazy till the rains came.  One more boil this week to make 4 for the season which is more then enough.  Won't store anymore sap, just empty the pails.  Hopefully it slows down soon."
964238,Sinker,2016-03-28 22:08:00,8692,Im keeping every last drop i can get this year. Going home to nfld this summer and most of it is coming for the ride. It will make a great bartering tool for seafood lol.  S.
964293,Rod Caster,2016-03-29 02:59:00,5784,"Syrup for seafood. Good deal on both sides!  I wasn't home Saturday, then on Sunday two of my buckets were overflowing. Never had that happen before.  I partially boiled my sap on Sunday, I'll finish it this weekend with whatever I collect over the rest of the week.  We still have 1.5 feet of snow in the bush, this season is far from over for me!"
959019,fisher,2016-02-23 01:41:00,451,"First year tapping some maple trees.  Been doing some research and wondering if anyone has some tips to share.  I have one that I read about. With the cold weather and the sap freezing a bit, I googled what affect the ice would have on it and how long I could store it until I got enough to Boil.  Apparently the water in the sap forms ice first leaving the unfrozen part more concentrated with sugars.  They say you can skim the ice off so there is less water in the sap, resulting in a faster process when you finally boil it down. Anyone have any experience trying this?  Also read you can store the sap for up to a week as long as temps don't go beyond 8-9 Celsius.  Looking forward to hearing ideas."
959021,chris.brock,2016-02-23 01:54:00,4053,"I'm not an expert at all, but I've kept it for 2 maybe 3 weeks, cool, shady spot, on snow, before boiling.  How many trees and what are you using to boil it?"
959026,fisher,2016-02-23 02:01:00,451,Only 6 trees this year. Small operation.  Hoping to get 120 litres by Sunday for my first batch whcih should yield me 3 litres of syrup.  Plan to boil it over an outdoor fire pit in a 60 litre large pot.  I'll keep adding sap to the pot as it boils down.   Hope to get it done by end of day.  I'll adjust depending on how it goes.
959035,Rod Caster,2016-02-23 02:52:00,5784,"Sap is running already!? Wow. My trees won't be ready until mid to late march if I'm lucky.  I kept sap for a couple weeks at a time by burying the full buckets (lids on!) in the snow; but my conditions are likely quite different than yours.  And, yes, go ahead and skim off the bit of ice on top. The sap freezes too so don't be too zealous and start throwing out frozen sap. One of my favourite things to do is to grab that small chunk of floating ice and drink any liquid dripping off it.  I can't wait for syrup season!! Good luck"
959042,Sinker,2016-02-23 04:12:00,8692,"We are tapping this weekend.  Yes, skim the ice off, but only if it is a skim. Any more than a skim of ice and its sap....you dont want to waste a drop of that!!!  I am surprised you even have sap flowing this week. Temps dont look good for my area anyways.  Im hoping to join forces with a buddy of mine this year. I moved from my last place with the maples and now dont have any. We are shooting for 100 taps this weekend.  S."
959069,fisher,2016-02-23 14:24:00,451,It was flowing on Saturday and Sunday but let off a bit yesterday.  I am in the GTA and the weather was great this weekend. Going get cold again according to the forecast.
959078,Sinker,2016-02-23 16:11:00,8692,"Yeah, I don't count on getting anything until at least mid march this year around here. 120 litres from 6 trees is a lot of sap. I hope you get it, but I have my doubts it will happen.  I boil over propane in an 80l flat pan. Takes me about 6 hours. I like to start a batch and finish it all in one shot. I find when I add more sap to a batch the quality goes down for some reason. The first run of sap makes the best syrup!  Love this time of year!   S."
959306,SmokestackLightnin,2016-02-24 15:19:00,390,"For those who were prepared the first run of sap happened this past weekend.  Some of the major players in my area were ready and have already boiled off their first run, earliest they have ever done that.  The long range weather looks like things will be stopped for a while, but you can still get your taps in as the next run will likely be longer and provide syrup of similar quality.  As mentioned by Sinker, the first runs of sap produce the best syrup.  I also suggest you not add sap to your boil.  A friend of mine who also produces at home was doing this and there was a noticeable difference in the taste of his syrup compared to the syrup I produced.  I would suggest pouring it off and filtering it into another pot for a finishing boil.  Depending on your volume you can boil off a number of batches to the almost syrup stage and then do a finishing boil with the number of batches.  That should not affect the taste or quality.  Welcome to the fraternity and good luck fisher in your efforts.  Keep us posted of your efforts."
959844,Joeytier,2016-02-26 17:26:00,3990,"We got another foot of snow Wednesday night, and there's 60-70 cm forecasted over the next 4-5 days and overnite lows from -14 to -19 and nothing above zero in the long term.  We have a TON of snow in the bush considering how late it was to show up, so this season might not end up being much earlier than last year if things keep going the way they are.  Not that I'm complaining..."
961467,Rod Caster,2016-03-08 13:20:00,5784,"how far north have the runs reached so far? I was going to hold off tapping until next week, but looks like things are lining up for an early run."
961473,Sinker,2016-03-08 14:53:00,8692,"We are running here now, but have no overnight lows coming to keep it flowing. What I collect today could very well be the end of it for me. This winter has sucked so bad for conditions!!!!!! GRRRR!  We collected 120l two weekends ago, collected 110l last night, and hope to have the mother of all runs today. 146 taps....most I've ever had out, and the least amount of sap EVER. Crazy. I hope we can get a couple more runs in but its not looking good for me here.  I guess I will get the boat ready....  S."
961474,Sinker,2016-03-08 14:53:00,8692,"The way its looking, you should tap asap and get every drop you can.  S."
961476,Rod Caster,2016-03-08 15:22:00,5784,You may be right. We still have 3-4 feet of snow in the bush. But that will change quick.
961481,Sinker,2016-03-08 16:31:00,8692,Its changing hourly here now. My bigger shaded trees have started running today.   S.
961487,irishfield,2016-03-08 17:30:00,26272,"Trees are tapped and running here in Penetang... other peoples trees that is, I don't have that much ambition !"
961491,fisher,2016-03-08 18:52:00,451,Managed to make 1 litre of syrup couple weekends ago using 40 liters of sap.  Have collected 60 litres more since (most of it in last two days) and should get a bunch more by end of the week.  Thanks for all the tips. And good luck with your batch. 
961524,Rod Caster,2016-03-08 22:33:00,5784,"Nice light coloured syrup!  Still four feet of snow in my bush. I tapped 5 trees and nothing starting, still ice at the base of the trees"
961550,lakerguy,2016-03-09 01:48:00,224,Sap ran all night last night and all day here. Stratford area. Going to start boiling tomorrow. Have about 2500 litres of sap now.
961574,north560,2016-03-09 12:40:00,38,"Heading to the bush today to start tapping,lots of rain yesterday and the weather did not drop last night, hopefully it will drop tonight. Tapping some new trees this year with any luck the weather will co-operate and we can get some sap this year suplly getting low in the cupboard."
961578,Rod Caster,2016-03-09 13:08:00,5784,"Where are you located North560? I'm close to North Bay. We also got the rain last night, and some +3-+6 temps this week."
961580,Acountdeleted,2016-03-09 13:17:00,2562,"Man, I'm envious of you guys. I long for the days when I can move out of the city and do stuff like this.  Think anyone will mind if I start tapping the trees in High Park?"
961582,Rod Caster,2016-03-09 13:22:00,5784,"We are planning a boil party in late March or early April. It's not so much a party as a few guys collecting sap, wearing t-shirts in the snow and drinking beer. Join us if you can!"
961584,Acountdeleted,2016-03-09 13:28:00,2562,Sweet. I think I can make it. I missed you guys this winter. Hope everyone is doing well.
962126,north560,2016-03-12 14:00:00,38,"Hi, we are located about 3hrs northeast of you in Gowganda. Tapped some of the trees but the weather is not co-operating."
962159,Rod Caster,2016-03-12 16:54:00,5784,I'm just about ready to hit the bush and tap 20 more. I'm betting the run has started today or yesterday .. We'll see
