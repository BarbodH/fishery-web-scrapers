968146,FrankTheRabbit,2016-04-30 20:02:00,479,"Thanks to Stoty, I'm a proud owner of a Made In Canada IMX SJR783S, but with the 2nd guide missing. I honestly thought it was a 782, but the blank is in such good condition, I'd like to enjoy it in its entirety. The conundrum is this: Any MH applications is handled well with my casting setups, so having a MH spinning rod is quite redundant. Trying to figure out what I should do to this nice rod:  A.) Spend $20 or so to have someone tie on the missing guide (were they Alconite inserts?)  B.) Strip all the guides and update them with SiC inserts  C.) Strip the rod completely and employ someone's expertise to build a casting rod out of it (I've never owned a custom rod before)  I realize that option C would cost a pretty penny, but I've heard some good things regarding Made in Mount Hope IMX blanks and would like to have that piece of history in my rod stash. And knowing this, Peterborough Shimano would probably replace the rod with the current model IMX, so that as an option, is out of the question.  So...what to do???"
