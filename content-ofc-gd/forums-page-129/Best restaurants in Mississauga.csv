967664,Acountdeleted,2016-04-25 20:33:00,2562,"Fish and chips at 5th street and lakeshore is the best on the planet. (I don't know the name we just always call em 5th street)  Fire pit at hurontario and Britannia is my fave for burgers  Skyway jacks on Mississauga road and Britannia makes a huge breakfast.  If you like sushi, heart sushi on Britannia and Mavis is really good."

967845,Acountdeleted,2016-04-27 11:46:00,2562,"Oh! I totally forgot, the Live Bait and Ale house out in Milton just off of the highway is amazing. We had one of the OFC meetups there before. I never thought I would like a veggie burger but they had a black bean burger there that was probably better then most beef burgers around. Its worth a look."

967903,Canuck,2016-04-27 23:17:00,491,"Halifax Donair in Milton since we are way out of Missisausage now. But to really appreciate a donair, you need to drink beer all night then go to the Palace till closing and eat one on the walk home dripping the sauce on your shirt and shoes. Nothing better, and you can still taste it in the morning.(Anyone that spent time in Halifax at a younger age will know what I am talking about. Halifax Donair is authentic though)."
