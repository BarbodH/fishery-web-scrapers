When I traded it in at Total Battery, the guy asked what I did to keep it that long.   Off season it stays on a VDC maintainer, constantly.  None of this once a month stuff.  Treat them right and they'll last a long time."
967985,glen,2016-04-28 19:58:00,2641,Ok.  Nice work. Now what did you catch?
967989,Big Cliff,2016-04-28 20:27:00,6899,You killed it? Why would you do such a thing to such a fathful friend?
967993,Fisherman,2016-04-28 21:22:00,7201,"Ok. Nice work. Now what did you catch? I got absolutely nothing, went east, west, south to Grape Is, up to the north side boat docks, shallow, deep.  You can still see down about 16 ft, nothing."
967994,Fisherman,2016-04-28 21:23:00,7201,You killed it? Why would you do such a thing to such a fathful friend? Beyond life expectancy by a wide margin.  It doesn't owe me jack squat.

Im the same way, in that theyre on trickle all year! especially after an outing with alot of trolling motor use. Time will tell. They actually come inside the house over winter. Damnit, they sound like pets now.    lol"
968023,Terry,2016-04-29 12:37:00,14456,Batteries don't like to be trickle charged. That's fine to maintain but not for charging.   You need 5 or 10 or  15 amps to do it right
