968059,wkrp,2016-04-29 20:58:00,656,Anyone know where I can source lead. I need it to balance my boat .  The setup in my boat does no allow me to redistribute weight from one side to the other. All I can do is to add weight to the port side. Any other ideas out there
968062,G.mech,2016-04-29 21:10:00,830,Find a friend....I  have the same problem.

968078,Sinker,2016-04-29 22:29:00,8692,"I moved my battery compartment in my boat to accommodate this problem. Sitting on the starboard side running the tiller with both batteries on the port leveled it out. But when I get people in the boat, they always seem to get too far to port and counter my efforts LOL....  S."
968081,spincast,2016-04-29 23:14:00,3279,"sand. locate it at  a point that will deliver the most counter balance. Because of the way it flows to fill a space, it is a great solution to a balance issue. I put 100 lbs in the bow under the deck, in a box, lined with plastic to keep it dry to help offset the weight of a 115 and 20 (both 4 strokes) hanging off the back of a  176.  so far, so good"

968113,crappieperchhunter,2016-04-30 12:39:00,2582,A bucket of water with the lid on.  S. What I do in my tinnie when I'm solo so I can get up on plane easier. On good days that same bucket has a feed of fish in it when I return home...so it gets double duty.
968114,Bill Shearer,2016-04-30 12:52:00,456,"You could  get scrap lead wheel weights from a tire shop pretty cheap if you decide to go that way. Lead shot is far too expensive, but a source is Hummason in Ancaster, ON."
