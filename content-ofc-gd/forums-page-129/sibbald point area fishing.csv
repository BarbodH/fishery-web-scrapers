967286,huzzsaba,2016-04-22 15:36:00,884,Heading for a day trip to Sibbald point Provincial Park today just to check out the park.  Wondering if there are any places close by besides the park where I can get the kids into a few fish.  Feel free to PM me.  thanks
967291,quickme,2016-04-22 16:03:00,261,head to the launch and you can cast out from there.   Haven't been this year but i've done that a few times in the past with my kids.
967293,dave524,2016-04-22 16:18:00,4508,"Long ago I spent a summer in Jackson's Point doing survey work for the old Dept of lands and Forests, if you can find access to the Black River in Jackson's Point or Sutton you can catch just about anything there, also, but not for kids maybe, if you want to do some bushwacking I got a lot of specs in the upper Pefferlaw Creek."

You could be right , I seem to recall a sanctuary for a time on the Black to protect Pickeral during their spawning season, are there even any pickerel left in Simcoe? Like you can't seem to find it either, thought it was below a dam ?  Edit: My bad, it was the Pefferlaw that had the sanctuary I recalled from Hwy 48 to the dam in town.  At least that one is still on the books."
967396,huzzsaba,2016-04-23 10:17:00,884,"Thanks for the recommendations!  We spent a few hours there yesterday and it was nice. Probably wouldnt camp there but great for day use Was a little bit windy and saw a quite a few people on the water with their parachutes (whatever they are called lol). No fish to be caught but saw tons of minnows (thousands literally) right at the shoreline.  Its nice to have a park that charges only $6 and allows you to stay for upto 4 hours.Thank you Sibbald point and Ontario parks!  Black river did look promising but like mentioned, it would probably be hard to find a access point since its surrounded by private properties."

Yeah, that could be a problem. I was on a summer job doing a woodlot survey for the Dept of Lands and Forests, they put us up in a cottage on the Briar's Country Club and we got to eat at the club house on the gov't tab, so we got to fish the golf course property, best summer job I had"
967405,Beans,2016-04-23 15:28:00,3339,We used to catch tons of perch in the spring off the docks at the marina in Jackson's Point but they closed off the docks  and the main dock because of too much damage...lots of minnows to be had with a small scoop (kid's butterfly net)...
967437,Dutch01,2016-04-23 21:22:00,1431, Edit: I should probably add it's a sanctuary just in case anyonle doesn't know..
