I have the Android version but my Samsung Galaxy 10"" is very sluggish and the battery life is poor.  Bought the original Canada lakes for Android (my phone) a few years back for $15 and we all got shocked a year later having to buy the new $50 HD edition because the original no longer worked and was not supported.  Anyways went to purchase the IOS version and noticed it is $75!  And then noticed it has in-app purchase of another $50! Navionics+ = $35  Am I going to have to spend $75 to find out I need the Navionics+ or other features also?    Hey, I'm a fanboy of Navionics mobile apps from the beginning but YIKES!  "
