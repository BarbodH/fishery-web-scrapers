967236,tb4me,2016-04-22 03:57:00,3295,So I just recently picked up 2 1000 liter  food grade totes. I have them hooked up to collect rainwater off my house. I want to install a pump and a garden hose for watering my garden. When i was a kid my grandpa had something similar in setup. I was a large tub full of rainwater with a pump and hose. What I cant figure out is that when you turned on the hose the pump automatically started and shut off with the squeeze of the handle. I would like to do this myself..Anyone here know how to do it? I cant seem to find any info online either.
967238,Freshtrax,2016-04-22 04:09:00,2215,You want a pump that is high volume low pressure.  The switch any old switch will work just have to run wire to it .... Only other way would be to use a pressure tank and pump when the pressure drops the pump kicks on.
967246,dave524,2016-04-22 10:50:00,4508,"As a kid (50's 60's) , neighbour was a market gardener with a fairly large green house for starting plants. He collected rain water for green house use, it was all gravity fed, you wouldn't need the water tanks elevated very much over the height of the garden.   Edit: I'm thinking drip irrigation and soaker hoses rather than sprinklers which would require more pressure and are less efficient."
967249,DanD,2016-04-22 11:45:00,2223,"What you want is an on demand water pump. Its a pump that is switched through a pressure switch ; that when you turn the hose/tap on the low pressure is felt and that trips the switch, turning the pump on, RV's use them so that there is no pressure tank. You can get them in either 12VDC or 120VAC. I have an account with a wholesale RV parts supplier and can get a 12 volt dc for around $65. (List $117.) and a 120 volt ac for about $175. (List $316.) The 120 would pump 3 gmp @ 55psi. The 12 volt would pump 2 gpm @ 30 psi  This is the 120 Volt pump; the 12 volt looks about the same.  Dan.  "
967358,tb4me,2016-04-22 21:50:00,3295,This is exactly what I was looking for..Perfect. Im thinking 12 volt would be best that way I can run it off battery and solar panel..    dave524 I have plumbed in a dual outlet at the bottom of the tank..One for gravity drip irrigation and one for a pump for a watering wand..I cant wait to get my hands dirty..I already planted onion beats radish and peas in the soil..Cant wait to see what I get.
967360,aplumma,2016-04-22 21:56:00,6896,yup you can also check out marine washdown pumps I have one on the boat and it is 12 volts. You also will need a place where the pump is protected from the weather they will short out if the motor gets wet.  this is the one I have.  http://www.westmarine.com/buy/west-marine--4-0-washdown-pump-kit--13997978  It has a filter as well as quick disconnect which makes it easy to bring inside after you are done.

967834,Freshtrax,2016-04-27 01:51:00,2215,Cool did not know these existed.
967840,Hoppy,2016-04-27 11:35:00,95,Here I thought these setups were only for growing cannabis.
967842,BillM,2016-04-27 11:40:00,17367,"I need to get a rain water collection setup done this year.  Screw paying the city to water my grass, lol."
967924,pics,2016-04-28 01:54:00,1268,I had a similar set up when my wife and I had an off the grid cottage in Kinmount.. the pumps are the same as the ones in an RV. The best thing about them is that they are repairable!!.. I will be setting up a rain barrel high enough off the ground to give me room to fill a pail under it.... Gardens do very well with rain water..

967933,DanD,2016-04-28 08:14:00,2223,No that is not an on demand pump; it would need to be manually turned on and off.  Dan.
