967403,fishnguy,2016-04-23 14:39:00,96,Just curious if anyone has used the sonar scans and community edits on the Lowrance HDS units.  I can't get these to load on my HDS 7.  Anyone have similar problems? Thanks
967407,NANUK,2016-04-23 16:25:00,797,what Navionics card are you using ?
967412,fishnguy,2016-04-23 17:31:00,96,"I had the gold, then purchased the update card which is supposed to allow community edits/sonar charts.  I downloaded the map area I wanted off the Navionics site, but it won't display any of the sonar charts on the unit, just the old chart."
967414,NANUK,2016-04-23 17:44:00,797,"Best thing is to call or e-mail Navionics, they are usually very helpful"
967416,fishnguy,2016-04-23 17:51:00,96,Will have to call on Monday.  Was hoping someone knew an easy fix in a pinch.  Thanks
967417,Terry,2016-04-23 17:53:00,14456,make sure you got them on the map took me a few tries before it worked right

967537,Kerry,2016-04-24 20:10:00,383,You cant beat you tube for learning the use of your HDS unit and navionics.Just browse through some of the tutorials. Kerry
967546,Mister G,2016-04-24 20:51:00,1429,I have a HDS7 Gen 2 Touch unit and have a Navionics Premium card that works great.........just got the  new unit in early March and had no problems with it reading that card or the Insight mapping that came with it.  What HDS7 unit do you have. Maybe I can walk you through it......

967561,Dan668,2016-04-24 21:53:00,1120,"As others said,  fish n chip in settings.  I hate navionics,  got a hotmaps platinum two years ago,  and of course you cant do the 99 dollar upgrade to navionics+,  but with every other possible card you can,  even competitors  cards.  What sense does that make. So,  now i have to buy another navionics + or sell my gen1 hds8 and upgrade to share maps"
