967584,tb4me,2016-04-25 00:31:00,3295,Hello to all online tonight.. I was wondering if anyone has any tips on finding a good creek with sucker minnows? I want to use them for pike in zone 17...I live in Brantford and Cottage in Campbellford. So places around these areas would be awesome..If you dont mind sharing please feel free to PM me if you want.  I like to think im resourceful but I haven't yet been able to find a place. so any advice would be much appreciated.. also do you use a net or just barbless hooks and a worm?

My neighbor had great success with them this weekend up there..He bought his in Toronto somewhere.. Yikes I hope he unknowingly is not spreading the VHS virus around..
