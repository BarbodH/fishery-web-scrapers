So now I've got 5 days off, a backpack of gear and my St Croix UL and fly rod ready to rock.  Any one have any ideas? There's 4 of us, we are hoping to hike or canoe into some fishing. Kawarthas is one option I think. Any insight or suggestions would be great. Hell, if you've got some land with a trout pond I'll listen"
967761,Tom McCutcheon,2016-04-26 15:00:00,627,Only thing open in the Kawarthas is Pike and Pan Fish at the moment. Walleye open in roughly 2 1/2 weeks. You could try some of the smaller Provincial Parks and resorts/campgrounds in mid to Southern Ontario where Trout season has opened
967762,BillM,2016-04-26 15:04:00,17367,I'd go resident trout hunting in Grey/Bruce.
967764,Dara,2016-04-26 15:40:00,3052,I would say Lake Superior PP but I don't think the ice is out there yet either
967777,Freshtrax,2016-04-26 17:05:00,2215,Queen Elizabeth wild Lands may be out of ice.
967822,Moosebunk,2016-04-26 23:54:00,3970,"Dunno if the Frontenac Park lakes are open for lakers and specks but, it's closer by. You could check it out. Water temps around there on deeper lakers are sitting around 50 to at most 55 right now, the trout be shallow."
967846,bow slayer,2016-04-27 11:53:00,1074,"check out sauble falls pp....should be some steelies around plus there is resident browns,rainbows and brookies. The park is open for camping. Plus you will be close to saugeen also."
967895,gaspumper,2016-04-27 21:20:00,393,There updated site says Tea Lake is open on April 28 2016
967923,Joeytier,2016-04-28 01:44:00,3990,I'd go resident trout hunting in Grey/Bruce. Yep.
