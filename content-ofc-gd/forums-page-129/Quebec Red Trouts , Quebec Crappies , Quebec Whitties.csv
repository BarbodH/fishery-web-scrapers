967474,Joeytier,2016-04-24 01:59:00,3990,"Amazing, but are those Quebec reds or specks?  Great fish either way.  Our trout season opened yesterday up in 13 too, would've tried to sneak out on a small lake if I wasn't stuck at work, ice is damn persistent this year!"

Our trout season opened yesterday up in 13 too, would've tried to sneak out on a small lake if I wasn't stuck at work, ice is damn persistent this year! Yea those are Specks. The real Quebec Red is actually a landlocked Arctic Char that has evolved into its own subspecies over time. Salvelinus alpinus  It's a common misnomer used on the Quebec side. The real one doesn't have those spots or square tail of the Speck. Nice fish and pics though regardless Kev. A great day fishing to be sure.  Cheers"
967526,Joeytier,2016-04-24 18:17:00,3990,"Yes you are right.  Apparently there are a couple lakes around here that have them, bucket list fish for sure"
967586,BassMan11,2016-04-25 00:51:00,583,Was on the Quebec side as well poking around looking for open water. It will be a couple weeks yet with these low temps before those mountain lakes are ice free. Nice report.
