I'll be driving into New Liskard Sunday night and making my way up and across to Thunder Bay, then into Kenora, Ears Falls, Rainy and back up to Pickle Lake.. I'll be making stops along the way for hotel stays but I want to do some fishing this time.  I can't pass this up.. I've always want to come up this way and what a better way to do it than with work covering my trip  Can anyone help me out here ?   What's open ?  Where to go ?  I don't care if it's from shore or in a boat.. I'll rent if I have too.    I don't want hot spots just some action..  PM me if you'd like to share..  I'm so looking forward to this..  Thanks, Tiz (Bill)"
968117,BillM,2016-04-30 13:22:00,17367,I'm wondering if you'll still run into some ice.
968120,Rod Caster,2016-04-30 14:07:00,5784,Lakes are still iced over up to 100% around north bay.  I'd be all over the north shore of superior fishing any public shoreline and river you can find for rainbows.
