965400,manitoubass2,2016-04-06 13:01:00,11391,I kinda like the idea since they both have access to huge walleye!  But darn is that a tease to split it into 3 episodes
965473,Old Ironmaker,2016-04-06 18:44:00,8243,"SPOILER ALERT !!!!!!!!!!!!!   I was a bit disappointed in episode 7. Taro makes that show. The Manitoba guy is definitely imitating the Linder's when he goes into his Chicago accent. I was impressed that they jury rigged the impellor in the parking lot. I wouldn't know where to start but now I do, that I liked. Wouldn't one need to put some type of sealant between the bottom end and the shaft housing?"

Yes i was bummed to see they don't have Paul and Taro in the tie break, makes sense but 2 teams isn't quite as exciting.

966274,Rizzo,2016-04-13 13:16:00,4754,once they got that 31 incher I woulda bolted out of that spot and come back later in the next period. Go take a nap then or see if you can find another spot. Why sting all the same size fish at once...then again what the heck do I know...maybe a 31 incher is very beatable out there...guess we will find out in upcoming episodes
966309,netminder,2016-04-13 17:26:00,514,"While watching the fish porn in the last episode was kinda fun, it was a little underwhelming overall. I'm not sure about the next few episodes either. Watching guys night fish in poorly lit conditions isn't all that exciting when they're only targeting one species. They better set a record or something in the near future lol"
966333,huzzsaba,2016-04-13 22:10:00,884,By far team Manitoba are the most entertaining

966388,ehg,2016-04-14 14:16:00,2666,This Uncut Angling 39 hours is best fishing show have watched in years.  The twins caught dozens of 27 inch walleyes and Team Manitoba huge 30+ inchers.  Amazing walleye fisheries out that way. Looking forward to the future episodes. Should be close.
966393,manitoubass2,2016-04-14 14:47:00,11391,"Both places are known for huge walleye.  I wouldnt be surprised to see a 33-34"" walleye.  Best show out and this contest is awesome!"
966402,Dutch01,2016-04-14 15:43:00,1431,"I agree with the prevailing sentiment, this is a great show and is much better than the typical ""infomercial"" type fishing shows."

Funny thing was they had this absolutely amazing tackle shop. It had everything  And at the reel station they had this lookbook of fish caught in the area that blew my mind! It was all tiny lil walleye, sauger and pike.  Left me baffled"
966495,bpsbassman,2016-04-15 01:00:00,941,Been watching the episodes as soon as they come out with my 18 year old Grandson.  Great bonding time and excellent show! Getting us both pumped to get out there.

967141,Old Ironmaker,2016-04-21 13:33:00,8243,"Yes of course Geoff, short bites. Duh. A stinger is a must on Nippising for Pics and when you are loosing fish regularly anywhere. A small box of stingers is always a good idea, usually I use a light small treble that won't take much of the lure's action away."

All of it quite different from the norm and entertaining. Would love to fish any of those waters at any point for anything."
968033,AKRISONER,2016-04-29 14:04:00,5558,"wow even more depressing, i looked into where they were actually fishing and then showed my dad the show, and sure enough he and a buddy used to fish the same lakes in Toba every June."
956257,manitoubass2,2016-02-05 14:13:00,11391,Im with ya lol
956384,LostAnotherOne,2016-02-05 23:48:00,956,Just finished watching all the episodes and sure hope more is to come.  Maybe they will have an Ontario team.  Sign me up.  There's a few guys on here I wouldn't mind teaming up with.
956385,Steve,2016-02-05 23:51:00,2075,"I know what you boys mean. When Manny was battling that huge pike, he had the fish to the gears...heavy rod doubled over....then I saw him go for the drag....thought NO don't do that...I mean, he likely wasn't tightening the drag, rather letting off it a bit....no sooner he did that the fish popped off!!! I've done that a number of times...big fish on...let off the drag....fish off. Shows that the fish simply wins every once and a while.  You can tell Manny simply has natural skills...he makes it look easy, almost like he isn't trying...but he nailed the big walleye in the river on the minnow spread, nailed the big pike (which he lost) in the last episode, caught the big crappie, and also nailed the huge sturgeon ... what a heart breaker that sturgeon was...you knew with five or six floating buoy markers that handling a huge sturgeon would be trouble....  Aaron Wiebe is a fish whisperer. The way he explains his fishing decisions is second to none. Manny's Pike, Crappie, and Sturgeon were all as a result of Aaron's excellent guidance. But Manny had the skills to hook the fish in all three cases. (just unlucky to lose two of the three).  I could watch this series forever. (and yes, I'm totally game for a fun attempt of our own this spring/summer)"
956421,manitoubass2,2016-02-06 06:41:00,11391,Totally agree but those are baby sturgeon lol  A good lake sturgeon is a good 45 minute fight
956422,Bondar,2016-02-06 06:55:00,817,"IMO  think he lost that pike cause his drag was loose you can hear it when he sets, you watch the first few cranks he's spinning the handle and rods going slack. Later on when they are crappie fishing Aaron ask him to check for a tight drag...."
956423,manitoubass2,2016-02-06 06:59:00,11391,This is gonna get big.  This is a fishing show!
956440,Steve,2016-02-06 14:48:00,2075,"Bondar, I re-watched it...and I think you are 100% correct. Drag was too loose to start, then was tightening it up...which means the second he took his hand off the handle of the reel the extra slack was created - fish off.  Well, the show has got my blood pumping enough....I'm heading out on Lake Ontario tomorrow for a winter troll.  :)"
956659,rob v,2016-02-07 22:05:00,535,"Very entertaining series and I think that may also be part of the allure (together with the things already mentioned) it's a series/story that gets your attention and keeps your interest.  I'm really enjoying it, and like someone else already mentioned, shows you that even these guys loose fish from time to time."
956664,Fisherpete,2016-02-07 22:26:00,1814,"Just watched all five episodes. Wicked show, very entertaining and funny. All of them have incredible skill. Going to Swiss Chalet now...  I'd totally be down for this, bit of a multi-species guy myself, and not afraid to get down and dirty with the coarse species!

I thought the Shimano team would be talking a run to Erie. It is spring yet they boated and measured a Smallmouth. I know it isn't the end of June by where the fish were holding according to Paul, who is obviously the team Capt. I can't be positive but I know you didn't need winter wear last June's opener. They didn't do well here, how can you go to Erie for Pics and forget line counters, Dipsys and or leadcore home? Oh I forgot what my wife keeps telling (yelling at) me "" It's a TV show!!"".  I like the Maniotba guy when he breaks out into his best Al Linder Chicago accent with a sprinkle of Minnisotian.  I like it."

No spoilers because I haven't watched the last episode yet but those are the guys I am cheering for. That Weibe guy must have an education in freshwater biology. The way he talks is like an encyclopedia of knowledge. I'd love to be in the boat with that guy for a day and just pick his brain, even if he is a little dorky."
957052,AKRISONER,2016-02-10 15:53:00,5558,"weibe reminds me so much of me and my fishing buds lol. Yes we are dorky as hell as well. I totally get their humour, it may not be for everyone.. but i know for a fact that id get along with those guys insanely well.  Also...netminder, it sort of his his manitoba accent...however he throws it on thick on purpose and I personally find it hilarious.  Taro's poem at the end of the last day had me in tears lol.  The dock perching was also epic, that totally reminded me of something that me and the buddies would do ahahha. One of my favourite parts of the whole series.  Please whatever you do, do not cast doubt on the ""reality"" aspect of this show...the premise of ""uncut angling"" is that they dont cut stuff to just make themselves look good...the classic catch the biggest fish of the entire show at the end of the show when its clearly dawn on the first day of fishing.  In regards to the (bass regulation part) Team Shimano clearly talk about catching their bass on the american side because they arent in season in canada yet...  In regards to your comment about the temperature, the guys wardrobe completely changes from the beginning of the show vs the end...why? well according to environment canada, on Saturday the high was 29 degrees in toronto, and then a low pressure system moved through (which it did on the show) and the high temperature on Sunday was 11 with a low of 7...so yes you would be wearing a full suit cause that would feel damn cold after it being almost 30 degrees the day before.  This is absolutely by far the best fishing show I have ever watched, most impressive in the last episode is how they read the water to find fish. The fishing geeks bloody drove around in a tinner, found some good water, anchored up and then proceeded to basically catch absolutely everything using a worm and a hook. Shows just how good these guys are."
957057,manitoubass2,2016-02-10 16:29:00,11391,Thats how you river fish! It teaches you alot!  If you would get along with these guys then we'd have a blast together!!!  This show has been awesome! Cant wait to see what 7 brings!!!

965326,BassMan11,2016-04-05 15:40:00,583,Just a reminder that Episode 7 is supposed to be out today. It will be interesting to see what happens.

965397,netminder,2016-04-06 12:43:00,514,"Not sure I'm fully for the idea for the playoff. The whole show up to this point was about multi-species and now they limit it to ONLY walleye? Kinda lame, IMO. They could have picked a different target species for each period or something. Mix it up a bit.  Not saying I won't watch. It's still entertaining"
954941,netminder,2016-01-26 13:54:00,514,"This is actually a pretty entertaining show even if a few of the hosts are some of the most annoying people I've ever seen. The one guy in Ontario with the laugh? Holy crappie.  Anyway, it's really cool to see guys target fish that would typically be considered junk any other time you hit the water. I think I've actually learned more watching this than I have in about a year of watching fishing infomercials on Saturday mornings."
954943,manitoubass2,2016-01-26 13:57:00,11391,Its really amazing to see how many fish they can succesfully target in the same darn spot lol.  I only have one spot like that and its got no trout???  Spoiler alert            That friggen brown! Wow!
955060,Freshtrax,2016-01-27 02:58:00,2215,"we should create teams and do our own this summer, something small like 20 dollar buy in.  All fish must be potographed with newpaper with the date or something."
955064,Old Ironmaker,2016-01-27 03:47:00,8243,"I just came up for air after watching the first 3 episodes. I have to say it has to be the best fishing show I have seen in very long time that I can say I really like. No 100K boats, there isn't a bank of electronic screens, ipilots, Power Poles and gadjets they flog on other shows and tell us we need them on our boats to catch fish. It really is refreshing to see all that STUFF isn't needed to catch fish. All 3 teams are entertaining and can be irritating too. My crew on the golf course and in the boat are always telling me to take a shut up pill, imagine if Taro and I were in the same boat (insert Taro laugh here). Paul Castellano knows that Niagara and mouth of that river like no one else and he isn't moving from it. They could jump in the truck and hit the Grand River in an hour and bound to get Bullhead, farm animals and monster Cats make a 5 minute run to Erie and catch monster Piks and 14"" Perch, that is if he wanted or needed to. That Niagara is some fishery holding everything right here in our backyard for many of us. The guys in Sask and Manitoba had to put a few hundred K's on their trucks going lake to lake. Team Manitoba has shown everyone that thinks they need to buy 20 buck Live Target baits a few things. Most of their fish were caught on 99 cent Pickerel rigs, 2 at a time. Real fishing for the real common fishing people like us, except Mike Borger of course.  I am going to watch what I believe is the finally now. It is nice to see the producers of this series doesn't fear the corporations that may be possible sponsors in the future, like Swiss Chalet and Mc Donalds. ""You didn't ask me to supersize that!!! And I hate Swiss Chalet, they aren't even Swiss."" I love it."
955066,Old Ironmaker,2016-01-27 03:49:00,8243,"You beat me to it Freshtrax, that would be fun. All you would need is a camera and a tapemeasure. Don't even need a boat."
955067,manitoubass2,2016-01-27 03:52:00,11391,Fourth episode is not the finale. But its as good as the rest!

955072,Old Ironmaker,2016-01-27 04:32:00,8243,"Watched episode 4, love it. I guess there is more to come. Who do you think will take it. My money is on team Shimano. I don't know if it's fair though since they can use 2 rods each on Ontario and get to cross the border and fish the US waters for Bass. I wonder why they aren't called Team Ontario? It was hilarious when Taro wouldn't touch the Bullhead, a pro guide that is afraid to handle a fish, that's funny."
955073,Old Ironmaker,2016-01-27 04:35:00,8243,"When ever someone in a meeting suggested a new project that person was usually told they are the co-ordinator. Great idea Freshtrax you will be a great coordinator, how can M2B2 help? Seriously though it won't be that tough a task. There will be a few hurdles as in many folks here work weekends so having it on a specific weekend may mean a few can't participate. Also some may not want to put in 20 bucks which doesn't mean others can't, those that aren't in a side bet just win bragging rights. It won't be a difficult task. I am willing to help Rick and yourself."

Fished through the entire night ... and kept going all morning.  watching Manny battle that huge sturgeon was tons of fun!  paul and taro pulled more bonehead moves, this time forgetting the trolling gear while attempting to catch the biggest walleye on Erie. They also forget the trolling gear the day before on Lake Ontario trying to fish for salmon, lol. Was awesome seeing them get that 24"" walleye rip jigging in 30' of water though.  my money is on Team Saskatchewan, but had Manny landed the monster sturgeon, I think Manitoba would have had it in the bag.  best fishing show ever."
956226,adempsey,2016-02-05 04:10:00,1498,"There will be no episodes 6 because I ran Taro over with a train.  Sorry, it had to be done."
956245,Fishwilly,2016-02-05 12:47:00,206,"we should create teams and do our own this summer, something small like 20 dollar buy in. All fish must be potographed with newpaper with the date or something. Just an idea but how about donating the proceeds from the pot?"
956254,AKRISONER,2016-02-05 13:57:00,5558,"is it just me, or is the best part of the show watching them fail?  Just to know that it isnt just me lol"
954287,Fishwilly,2016-01-21 11:51:00,206,Has anyone caught the first 3 episodes on their YouTube channel. Really entertaining fishing competition. I've fished with Taro before and always get a kick out of his crazy laugh.
954294,mark demmery,2016-01-21 12:45:00,68,"i got caught up yesterday. watched all 3. great competition with some top notch multi-species anglers. Paul and Taro are hilarious, polar opposite personalities in the same boat for 39hrs!! lmao."
954298,AKRISONER,2016-01-21 13:44:00,5558,"been a major uncut fan for a while, so this series has got me pumped. ive been so busy lately i havent been able to catch up, but the first ep is awesome.  A lot of people hate weib cause hes a dweeb but I find him pretty funny and probably the best fishing show host out there. The guy gives the straight dope and would rather live in his mom's basement than sell out."
954302,Brettiop,2016-01-21 14:09:00,279,"Sweet series so far, I don't know who to root for!  I'm leaning shimano i think"
954304,porkpie,2016-01-21 14:27:00,2521,I stopped watching fishing shows because of all the product pumping.  Got to the point that there where more ads than content.  I'd go fishing with that dude any day.  I'll have to check out the new episodes.
954312,PUMP KNOWS,2016-01-21 15:29:00,937,"I can't wait for next weeks episode!  ""Addicts lie... don't tell Paul I ate Mcdonalds"" ""Taro, you hungry?  You want breakfast?  Mcdonalds?""  ""Black Weenie""  ""Banking Sand""  All classic"
954323,AKRISONER,2016-01-21 17:18:00,5558,"I stopped watching fishing shows because of all the product pumping. Got to the point that there where more ads than content. I'd go fishing with that dude any day. I'll have to check out the new episodes.  Start watching uncut angling...he makes a point of not pumping his products, hes only using what he uses because it actually works. He rarely points out that he is using a specific bait and will even complain about certain products if he thinks they are too expensive, and will suggest alternatives to save money."
954334,Joeytier,2016-01-21 20:29:00,3990,"Watched all 3 so far!  Excellent series, great concept and lots of laughs, far superior to anything on TV these days."
954336,landry,2016-01-21 20:36:00,1005,Great show. How could anyone not like Weib. He's hilarious and a true innovator and not a sellout.
954371,Lunkerhunter,2016-01-22 03:13:00,455,Best show out there. Extra gravy baby
954384,ckewley,2016-01-22 12:30:00,699,"Love the show, credit Weib for putting me onto Kanalgratisdotse , the best YouTube channel IMO!"
954396,AKRISONER,2016-01-22 14:25:00,5558,only two things i like banging...banging sand and banging bass
954404,Joeytier,2016-01-22 15:19:00,3990,"Their channels awesome too, the collab video between the two is hilarious"
954407,Steve,2016-01-22 15:51:00,2075,"So I watched the three episodes last night. As a multi species angler myself, who targets every fresh water fish that swims, I think the Uncut 39 hrs of Angling is the best fishing I've ever seen on TV.  Favourite highlights so far:  - Paul and Taro starting so late Saturday morning (Talk about confidence, lol) - Taro getting shut out of McDonalds for filming. - Manny from team Manitoba just absolutely kills me. - Paul is the best fisherman I've ever seen on TV. The way he moves from species to species with confidence and expertise is second to none. - Taro is like Manny, absolutely hilarious. - Love how Manitoba and Saskatchewan plan on fishing through the night...Paul and Taro, not so much.  :) (again, over confidence).  Truthfully, Manitoba and Saskatchewan wouldn't have a chance of winning this if Paul and Taro fished more seriously. They could have gotten the King first thing Saturday morning (if they were actually fishing) and would be able to get some big cats on the grand fishing Saturday night (if they weren't sleeping, lol).  Niagara River / Niagara Bar / Lake Ontario, for multi species angling, is likely the best spot in all of Canada. Manitoba and Saskatchewan anglers have to keep changing lakes / waterbodies to hit their multi species needs.....Taro and Paul COULD Have done it with just the Niagara River / Lake Ontario and the Grand River.  And ... I have to say it again, Paul's ability to fish multispecies is second to none. So far they have 3 way'd, casted, jigged, fly fished, downrigged, dipsy'd, and planer boarded - all without going back to shore!!!!  I can't wait to see what ""day two"" brings...we'll see if Lake Diefenbaker will save team Saskatchewan. If they hit a mutant Brown, Bow, and Walleye, they just might be able to pull this off. (and I kinda hope they give Team Ontario a run for their money, as Team Ontario could have fished smarter).  THIS is what fishing TV should be all about!"
954437,AKRISONER,2016-01-22 20:32:00,5558,"totally agree that the great lakes are like cheating when it comes to multi species angling.  The frigging guys catch a tiger musky by accident lol ridiculous  I think of my days fishing in manitoba, we caught ling, walleye, pike, perch, lakers, suckers and whiteys...and that was pretty much it.  Meanwhile on Georgian bay, to catch walleye, perch, pike, smallmouth, largemouth, bullhead, white bass, bowfin, gar, salmon, lake trout, ciscoe, crappie etc etc etc could literally be done in a 20 square kilometer radius in one day...no joke.  I do expect the manitoba and saskatchewan boys to catch an absolutely monster pike and walleye.  Im also really hoping manitoba gets a mooneye just because."
954449,RJackson,2016-01-22 23:30:00,113,"Steve,  When I started watching this I knew you'd get a kick out of it too.  It's well done and entertaining.  Hope Pops is doing well!  RJ"
954481,Bondar,2016-01-23 06:15:00,817,"It's a great show, and niagara is an incredible fishery!! We're lucky to be so close to so many species and year round boat fishing . The out come of this show is the best part no trophy, cash prize. Rods donated to kids getting into fishing no matter the outcome everyone wins"
954634,manitoubass2,2016-01-24 20:03:00,11391,I cant find the last episode????  Great contest and great show!
954641,adempsey,2016-01-24 21:18:00,1498,Watched them last night. Can't wait for the next episode!  Lovin' it!
954645,manitoubass2,2016-01-24 21:22:00,11391,I hope they post it soon!  If your not too familiar with the show go watch the bloopers real!???
954659,Joeytier,2016-01-24 22:19:00,3990,Episode 4 should be released tomorrow.
954681,67ZL1,2016-01-25 01:15:00,51,What I really like about Uncut is that Aaron and his buddies don't have 50k plus boats that most of us will never be able to justify buying. I've met Aaron at Cabela's in Winnipeg a couple of years ago. I had no clue who he was at that time. We Bull'd for over an hour about fishing. He was very down to earth and not full of himself. Couple of days later I saw his show on WFN and almost fell out of my chair.
