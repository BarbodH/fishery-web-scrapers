My old one is over 30 years old now and will be heading out to the cabin to hold my cabin tools, This big girl will be replacing it and should hold a bunch more tools than my old one that is completely stuffed. Still have tools everywhere that wouldn't fit in the old one. Should clear up a bunch of space in my tiny little workshop. As a bonus it was on sale over $1K off and because I put it on my CT credit card I get to spread it out over 24 months with no interest and I got $70 CT Money on the card to spend elsewhere. It's a win, win, win!!!!  "

968279,DanD,2016-05-02 11:41:00,2223,Still remember when I bought my first Mac Tool's tool box; I was 17 or 18 then. I was so proud to tell my Dad that I got it cheep at $1800.00; he asked what tools came with it? When I told him that it was an empty box he flipped. LOL Used that box up to about 20 years ago; had to replace it when the bottom rusted out. The replacement was around 10 grand and yes it was empty as well and it was my wife that flipped out on me that time. LOL  Dan
968283,leaf4,2016-05-02 13:12:00,2466,"Nice box! My brother has 2 he's a licensed mechanic, so his first one he bought as an apprentice, a snap on half that size then a beastly mac tools one when he got licensed, also helped the tools guys that go around to the shops had some killer incentives at the time too"
968287,icceman,2016-05-02 13:54:00,36,My pride and joy. 
968289,Dara,2016-05-02 14:02:00,3052,Nice tool box but why is it in the kitchen?
968293,DRIFTER_016,2016-05-02 14:57:00,10439,Nice tool box but why is it in the kitchen?  What? You don't rebuild sleds and motorcycles in your kitchen?  That's the closest room to my tiny little shop with enough space to unpack and assemble it.
968309,cuzza,2016-05-02 17:13:00,467,Does it fit through the shop door?
968310,DRIFTER_016,2016-05-02 17:15:00,10439,"Does it fit through the shop door?  Yep, it's in it's new home and filled with tools."
