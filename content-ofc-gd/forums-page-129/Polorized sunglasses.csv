For me that means in a few years my glass lenses will most likely be clearer the if I had got plastic...  That was my train of thought   Im talking the effect to the eyes.  You can get scratch proof lens, but that cost a fair penny. I use to get it when I needed glasses."
967024,FrankTheRabbit,2016-04-20 02:16:00,479,"Got my Costa Cortez shades today with the copper 580G lens. They're actually noticeably lighter than my Smith Optics, despite both being glass lens. The frames are made in Taiwan using a lightweight nylon material. My SmithOptics are from Italy. By the feel of it, the Smith Optics seems to have the better quality.  Since I got them just now, I couldn't test them out in the sun, but I still used my computer monitor to test the polarization of the lens.  As can be expected, the lens was able to create a complete black out effect with no distortion or uneven polarization. Smith Optics and Costa certainly have quality lens. There are also some neat looking vents on the outside hinges of the frames for venting. They're quite small so I don't know how effective they will be to prevent fogging on the inside,  One thing that I could possible take away from, is the fit. Costa's website lists the Cortez frames for a large fit, but they still feel a bit tight. My Smith Optics are also on the large fit size, but they actually feel more suited for my big melon. I'll update the circumference here so other people may use it as some sort of guideline on fit.  I'm looking forward to the morning to see how they perform in the daylight.  "
967048,Raf,2016-04-20 12:50:00,3495,"i typically buy shades online but going into a store and fitting different frames on my melon is critical.  when it comes to fishn glasses, the less opportunity for light to come in the sides top or bottom of the frame, the better -- which is why I find the wraparound bugeye style to be best.  just a matter of picking the frame model that accomplishes this best."
967413,misfish,2016-04-23 17:40:00,29133,"Holly, what a pair of shades. My left eye was so relaxed wearing them today fishing the rivers. I didnt have one bright flicker the whole time wearing them. Even the drive home, my stigment didnt even bother me. Im so glad I bought these Maui,s."

965472,FrankTheRabbit,2016-04-06 18:44:00,479,"Thanks for the feedback about the 580 lens, fellas. I know it's probably better to ask about it considering the waters here would be different than the States and I'll start getting info regarding frames and fit. But looks like I'll be looking for glass copper lens too.  I love my SmithOptics shades (both polycarbonate & glass lens) and they've been the best I've used to date. Customer service was top notch, no questions warranty. Although, I'll always be curious to know how the Costas will compare.  Grimsby: A friend picked up a pair and at one point, I was seriously debating plunking down the $$$ for a pair of them. At the time, $100 for a pair of shades kept me away...until finding out how some were more than double for a pair of NUMA optics.  It'll also be interesting how my eyes will react with different lens and for all I know, my eyes may not even be able to discern the difference between the two. Everyone's eyes are different.  Mike: Enjoy your new shades man! One of the best investments to make, which is so underrated by many."

Luxottica is apparently the world's biggest supplier of lens to manufacturers. They include most, if not all, luxury designer sunglasses, like Armani, Dolce Gabana, CK, Nike, etc. And they also include brands such as Rayban, Persol, and Oakley. From what I know, MJ, Costas, and Smith Optics do not use lens from Luxottica. Some use trivex lens and others use another polycarbonate lens called CR 39 monomer plastic. I'm no chemist, so I dunno what that means lol.  Anyhow, you can check up Wikipedia for all the brands that Luxottica supplies their lens to."

The optical quality of the lens is much better in a high end pair than a cheap pair. Less eye strain is the biggest plus health wise while the much sharper lens and better optics allow you to see much better into the water.  When I put on a cheap pair of shades the image I see is fuzzy and out of focus compared to good quality optics. I actually get headaches when wearing inferior glasses. Same was true for me with safety glasses for work. I couldn't use the bulk, cheapies at work and had to purchase higher quality ones in order to be able to do my job without eye strain and headaches."

No more burning eyes or headaches while on the water either.

They are definitely better than the cheapies that  I used to have, but no idea how to compare with Mauis, Costas, etc. The Costa 580G lenses are pretty famous for being amazing.  Two notes that may help: - bigger is better.....make sure they're big enough to properly cover your eyes/face - bronze/copper is good all around on ontario lakes, but the saltwater guys (on clear water) almost always have greens, I think.  May be worth looking into that.   The Costa site has a guide to lense colour.  Blue and green are for harsh direct sunlight that you get in the tropics  silver mirror, most versatile, cloudy days  gray, everyday, natural contrast  copper driving, variable light  Amber for dawn and dusk.  Light conditions are constantly changing. to get the most out of Costa lenses, it's important to choose the right color. We offer six lens colors that range from low-light like dawn to extremely bright light with blinding glare."
965177,netminder,2016-04-04 14:43:00,514,"I have to agree with the silver mirror in the above chart, but would also say copper is most useful if you're fishing dirtier/muddier water.  As for price point, the total cost doesn't matter as long as they're actually polarized. Most of the time once you're over the $100 point you're paying for the frames and/or the brand. Even though I spent like $200 on the Ray Bans in my avatar, I still managed to have them fall out of my shirt pocket and 3 m deep into a sanitary manhole. Although they did last me like 3 years to that point, longer than any pair of sunglasses to date, and the only time up until then that I've spent more than like $50 on sunglasses. If I spend more money on them I'm going to take better care of them."
965184,PBenson,2016-04-04 15:48:00,154,I got my first pair of costas recently and I won't be buying any other brand maybe ever. They're incredible.
965186,Lape0019,2016-04-04 16:01:00,647,"I've had Oakley, Muai Jim and Revo as my higher end glasses. Not all of the oakleys were polarized but they were all comfortable to wear all day if need be.  This is my experience  If these are specifically for fishing (that you would wear every day maybe...), a good set of polarized glasses that fit well to your face will be better for you. The less light that gets behind the frames, the better the clarity and better you can see. there will be glare with polarized glasses but nowhere near as much. if you can block out any light from the backside, that glare is virtually gone.  If these are an every day set and you will use them for fishing from time to time, any brand will do. The Maui Jims were comfy and did a great job. I ended up leaving them at a restaurant so replaced them with Oakley fishing specific straight jackets.  The Oakleys were the comfiest to wear and had great clarity. The Maui were light and flexible but let a lot of light in (it was the model I chose) and the Revo ones had a coating on them that repelled water ( it was called the water lense).  I'd buy another paid of Oakleys ( I actually just bought replacement lenses for the straight jackets as they are that comfortable and would buy another paid or Maui Jims in a heartbeat. I don't think I would buy another paid of Revo glasses.  If I wanted to try something new, it would be the Costa glasses with the actual glass lenses. Every review I read is always about how clear and durable they are. I just haven't seen a fram I like."
965188,JoshS,2016-04-04 16:26:00,729,"I think they are all pretty good in terms of quality lenses and seeing in the water. Definitely make your decision based on comfort and warranty service. Especially is you are going with a ""premium"" pair. Nothing worse than pressure on your temples, fogging, slipping, hat hitting sunglasses, or bad service.  I have cheap pairs and a pair of hobies which are super comfortable,but the finish on the frames isn't holding up after 3 years. Also have a pair of carrera's. I've put those up against oakleys and a few others and all performed around the same seeing in the water."
965189,BassMan11,2016-04-04 16:32:00,583,"If you are going to go higher-end go i'd Maui Jim. I'd say the difference between Maui Jim, Costa del Mar, or Oakley from a performance or look standpoint they are all fairly similar. But once you start reading reviews and learn about excellent Maui Jim's customer service is in comparison to the other brands is a pretty easy decision.  I picked up a pair of Peahi's with the glass and HCL Bronze lenses earlier this year. By far the most comfortable and best fitting sunglasses I have ever owned. IMO of course."
965193,kickingfrog,2016-04-04 17:00:00,8333,"Sure but the point is there is zero difference  between sunglasses except price and name. Zero, none, nada. This isn't lighter components or better build. This is one of the biggest mark-ups in retail, save for designer handbags."
965198,Lape0019,2016-04-04 17:41:00,647,There is zero difference when it comes to blocking out UV protection. There is a major difference in clarity between a $30 pair of glasses and a $200 pair of glasses. Is the price difference worth it? It is to me.

This isn't lighter components or better build. This is one of the biggest mark-ups in retail, save for designer handbags.  Couldn't be further from the truth. The pics I posted on the first page shows the difference between quality lens and cheap lens, despite the H20ptix costing $49 and getting them for $26 on sale. You can see the H20ptix lens didn't have full polarization. Near the corners exhibited a rainbow effect. The SmithOptics lens blocked out 100%. I'm sure the competing brands (Oakley's, MJs, and Costas) all do the same thing. You can certainly try it by rotating the shades in front of your monitor to see how much glare gets blocked out.  Also, the coating on the lens can differ between the premium lens and the cheap ones. The cheaper ones tend to scratch off and also wear out over time. On Smith's page, they show how their lens technology is different by embedding the polarization film into the lens. Also, the tapered lens removes any distortion. For prescription glass owners, if you have thick glasses, you'll notice that the corner visual quality gets distorted.  If some of you are interested in lens tech from Smiths. I'm sure Oakley's, MJs, and Costas are similar. Just scroll down to see the illustrations. http://www.smithoptics.com/us/techsunglass  The science behind different lenses.

965202,bare foot wader,2016-04-04 18:22:00,1354,"UV protection isn't the only criteria imo, and there is still a difference in that department too between cheap vs premium  lens quality makes a big difference in eye strain on a 12+ hour day, just like spotting game with cheapy binos, you'll never hear a single hunting guide tell you cheapy binos will cut it, eye glasses shouldn't be any different.....quality lenses reduce eye strain and especially in a water environment you're exposed to more glare...I feel my eyes are worth the money to splurge on glasses  I like the maui jim pehai, actual glass lense vs polycarbonate, I wear them 90% of the time...I have some oakleys with dark blue lenses for general cruising around on bright days  my buddy said he thought he was watching a steelhead a while back, rapala glasses, handed him my maui's and wait a second, there's two there!"

965210,Old Ironmaker,2016-04-04 19:15:00,8243,"No glasses on my boat, no fishing. I always carry a few extra pair of polarized sunglasses onboard. I once buried a hook in my brother in laws eye. We were getting off the boat and a worm harness let go from the rod. He opened his eye and the hook just fell out. Lucky. I know many that don't wear glasses or shoes onboard. I thing that's just being irresponsible. A guy I knew almost lost his foot with an infection from fish slime or whatever gets into a small cut on the hands or foot."
965214,craigdritchie,2016-04-04 19:33:00,1586,"Sure but the point is there is zero difference between sunglasses except price and name. Zero, none, nada. This isn't lighter components or better build. This is one of the biggest mark-ups in retail, save for designer handbags.   Not so.  Lenses are made from all sorts of different materials. Some are much more optically correct than others, which means far less eye fatigue. Some lenses scratch easily, others don't. Some are more resistant to impact, like a split shot or a spinnerbait zinging your way after some fish shakes the hook in mid-jump. Some lenses are much heavier than others, and other types are more resistant to fogging. There are even more differences in frames. Some are heavier, some are lighter, different materials take more abuse than others, some have spring-loaded hinges so the arms won't snap off if they get extended the wrong way.  It probably is true that some fashion brand sunglasses may cost a lot more than they're worth. But saying that there's no difference between any of them is just foolish. That's like saying all fishing rods are identical except for name and price.  Makes no difference to me ... I'm stuck to wearing prescription ones."
965221,Bass Tard,2016-04-04 20:00:00,128,"I have two pair of Spy polarized, and recently got a pair of Arnettes.  I'd recommend either, both very high quality.  My first pair of spy polarized are over 10 years old and still look as good as the day I bought them.  I'd also like to throw out there to the guys who are ""hard"" on glasses and break them a lot, good quality glasses can take quite a beating before they break unlike cheap ones.  I've sat on mine countless times and they're still just fine.  They've also spent an hour at the bottom of the pickerel river, until some kid lent me his goggles and I could go down and find them.  Good quality glasses are totally worth the extra money, if you're arguing otherwise, I'd venture to guess you've never owned a pair of good glasses.  As been said, you've only got on pair of eyes.  Its almost like arguing that you don't need snow tires because you've always been fine without them.  Doesn't make it right.."

There are tests that layman like us can do that will show vast differences in lense quality. Maui jims have the highest quality lenses available, some others are good of coarse as well."
965226,kickingfrog,2016-04-04 20:32:00,8333,"Plastic and glass. The coatings can make a difference but money has virtually nothing to do with the quality.   If prescription eye glasses are marked up hundreds of dollars for a brand name, and they have individually ground glass lenses what do you think the cost of mass producing sunglasses is?  Sure there is garbage out there, as I said before, and you do have to compare. The information is there, ignore it if you will but don't suggest that I have to."

So far I'm very pleased with them and the lenses are great for the dollar value.   Time will tell if they hold up.  I only buy amber lenses.

965076,SylvanOwner,2016-04-03 20:48:00,266,"I got a pair of Smith Optics ""Parallel Max"" a few years back and really like them.  They have interchangeable lenses and came with 3 sets, only 1 was polarized but I've used the others (clear and a light rose) for night skiing as I don't like goggles and like the cold air on my face.  By having them interchangeable it gives you options on different colors for different sky conditions and also means you can just replace the lense if you get a scratch rather than the whole pair of glasses.  Don't give up on the cheapies though, if you're tough on glasses or accident prone I've had several pairs over the years that I thought were just fine.  Beware of just how much you are paying for the ""brand"" and not necessarily much improvement in quality.  I'm not exactly sure how you do this short of pooling the OFC Community....  .  Is there such a thing as an unbiased optician, they are going to push the product they have in their store.  Maybe an optometrist who doesn't also retail?"

I sent them in for warranty and I received a new pair of Terrace shades. Customer service might be worthwhile to consider and I've had nothing but good things about them.

The grey are best on the water if it is sunny I like the bronze for driving or hazy days. I always go for the glass lenses the trade off for the best optics is they get heavy on the nose but they are also more scratch resistant. I'm cheap when it comes to buying clothes but I don't mind buying expensive sunglasses 1 full day in the boat and the value of quality sunglasses is very obvious to me.

They are definitely better than the cheapies that  I used to have, but no idea how to compare with Mauis, Costas, etc. The Costa 580G lenses are pretty famous for being amazing.  Two notes that may help: - bigger is better.....make sure they're big enough to properly cover your eyes/face - bronze/copper is good all around on ontario lakes, but the saltwater guys (on clear water) almost always have greens, I think.  May be worth looking into that."
