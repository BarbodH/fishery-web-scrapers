968151,landry,2016-04-30 21:50:00,1005,Beans. I am sorry for your loss. I bet you have some great fishing memories with her.
968219,Beans,2016-05-01 14:15:00,3339,The one memory I recall is when she wanted me to take her ice fishing around the middle of January but she was 8 1/2 months pregnant so No Way ! My first grandson was born the 29th of January...LOL  Another is when she caught a 5 lb. bass on the white rubber mouse I gave her to fish in the swampy part of the park...She went all around the park showing it off to everyone... Nobody had the heart to tell her that bass season didn't open until the next day...LOL
