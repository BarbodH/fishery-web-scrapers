967927,DRIFTER_016,2016-04-28 03:45:00,10439,Been too busy with the cabin. I only got out fishing twice this winter. Now I have to fix my sled and get my boat ready while waiting for ice out. The sled has to be done now as I don't want to have to fix it up while waiting for ice up in late October. The weather outside is much nicer now.  I'll be getting the boat out as soon as there is some open water to fish though.
