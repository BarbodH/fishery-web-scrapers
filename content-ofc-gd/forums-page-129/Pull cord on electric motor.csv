968188,mike rousseau,2016-05-01 11:25:00,4661,Hello everyone  On my electric motor there is a pull cord to deploy it....  The original broke years ago and I replaced it with some cheapi parachute cord... I have to replace it 1-3 times a year!  It's annoying especially if it breaks before I have a chance to change it  Has anyone found a good meterial that will last to use?  It's really tricky to replace... As the tie is inside metal tubing with a small access hole to the tie point...
968189,Big Cliff,2016-05-01 11:36:00,6899,"If you have to replace it a couple of times a year there is likely something else wrong, I'd be looking for a burr on the tube or flywheel. CTC has replacement pull cords for lawn mowers which should do the trick if everything else is ok."
968190,mike rousseau,2016-05-01 11:51:00,4661,I'll check for a burr but it seems more like sun damage... The rope is always really faded when it breaks
968193,Sinker,2016-05-01 12:19:00,8692,Try some synthetic winch rope. It wont break.  S.

968196,ecmilley,2016-05-01 12:42:00,2163,Try and break that

968202,John Bacon,2016-05-01 13:27:00,3277,There are after market electric motor pull cords available.  I purchased one from Cabelas or Bass Pro in the US as few years ago.  A product designed for that purpose may last longer.
968229,aplumma,2016-05-01 15:27:00,6896,Get a lawnmower pull cord and then wax it. Take wax and melt it in the microwave and then pour a small amount on a rag. Take the rag and dip it in the wax and wipe down the cord..   Art
968230,manjo39,2016-05-01 15:39:00,354,I have the same issue.  The stock cord has snapped on me and now the cord is too short.  I'm going to try this DIY solution.  Much cheaper than the aftermarket cord solutions.  
968248,Fisherpete,2016-05-01 18:21:00,1814,Pfffffftttttt stop cheaping out Mike and drop the $2500 for a self-deploying Ulterra  Oh yeah they break often also  Nevermind lol
968253,kickingfrog,2016-05-01 19:31:00,8333,I had a vision of someone trying to pull-start an electric motor.
968255,farsider,2016-05-01 19:50:00,456,Just get Bubbles to give you a boost from his lawnmower.  Eh Ray?
968302,Carp,2016-05-02 16:40:00,1488,"I was a little baffled as to how you pull start an electric too. ..........until I read on.......  If your boat is out in the sun often, it can make the cord dry and brittle, but not as often as you're claiming. As mentioned, there must be something rubbing/fraying the cord for it to fail that frequently."
