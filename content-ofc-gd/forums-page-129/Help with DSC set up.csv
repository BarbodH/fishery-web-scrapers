967543,spincast,2016-04-24 20:34:00,3279,"Looking for some wiring help: want to connect a HDS 7 gen 2 to a Standard Horizon  DSC GX1000S VHF Here's what the Standard Horizon  connection chart shows:  White - External Speaker (+)       ................    Connect to externla 4 Ohm Audio speaker Shield - External Speaker (-)         ..............    Connect to 4 Ohm Audio speaker Blue - NMEA Input (+)                 ...............    Connect to NMEA (+) output of GPS Green - NMEA ground (-)             ..............     Connect to ground of GPS Purple - NMEA Output (+)          ................     Connect to (+) input of GPS   Here's what the HDS Chart shows;  HDS                                                         Device  Green RX (-)                                             Transmit (-) Orange RX (+)                                          Transmit (+) Shield (Ground)                                         Ground Yellow TX (+)                                             Receive (+) Blue TX (-)                                                 Receive (-)  This is a NMEA 0183 set up.  I tried pretty well everything I could think of based on these descriptions, and the radio continued to read  NO POS. From the radio green purple and blue are a set, white and shield are a set.   Both radio and FF  need NMEA 0183 version 2.0 or higher to communicate. The HDS is set to communicate by default   anybody done a similar set up?  "
967560,G.mech,2016-04-24 21:42:00,830,"I have a very similar setup.  You only need two wires, I will go dig out my manual after supper, I made my own diagram after going through the same routine.....stand by."
967566,G.mech,2016-04-24 22:17:00,830,"Okay here is it, mine is a GX1000S as well hooked to Lowrance HDS:  It is not at all clear in either manual but you hook the Radio NMEA Input (+) [bLUE] to the HDS TX (+) [YELLOW].  Connect the Radio NMEA (-) [GREEN] to the ground wire on the HDS and you're good to go.  Just double checked my wiring on board to be sure and that's all there is to it.  The purple wire on the radio is not used nor are the wires for the external speaker.  Hope this helps."

967571,misfish,2016-04-24 22:59:00,29133,"awesome, thanks!  When your done Rick, you can rig my toon.  Good luck with the hook up bud."
967572,G.mech,2016-04-24 23:05:00,830,"awesome, thanks!  Well let's not get too hasty....wait to see if it works first!"
967579,spincast,2016-04-24 23:34:00,3279,update at 6..... one day this week. patience pool is drained for today
967702,spincast,2016-04-25 23:33:00,3279,"G.Mech - I tip my hat to you sir, thanks "
967711,G.mech,2016-04-26 01:05:00,830,"Bravo Zulu (well done) to you on the hookup!  While I was crawling under my dash to verify the wiring on my boat, I found the GPS wire that came loose on my Smartcraft gauges last year and now they are firing on all cylinders too!    I think it was good karma because I had no real intention on sorting that one out without a good reason."
