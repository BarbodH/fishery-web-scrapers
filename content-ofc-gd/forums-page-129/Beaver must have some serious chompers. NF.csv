967540,wkrp,2016-04-24 20:21:00,656,Rumour has it that when a beaver is cornered it will bite off its own genitalia.
967548,SirCranksalot,2016-04-24 20:54:00,3291,Or he might bite off yours if you're the one who's cornering him! Ouch! Watch out!!
967552,manitoubass2,2016-04-24 21:11:00,11391,"I see this often, beavers are awesome engineers!  Highly skilled animals.  Off topic but one time as a youngster, me and two buds were coming home from the bar drunk.  In my neighbours driveway stood a beaver???  We played around abit and its smackin its tail on the pavement.  Next thing ya know its chasing us.  Word up, beavers are pretty fast on dry land so yeah, dont screw with them.  Super cool animals!"
