967647,Dara,2016-04-25 18:59:00,3052,"I made it out for a bit of fishing.  Wed night was smelts. Too dark for pictures so this is Thurs night.    Then since work is so slow they make me take Fridays off so we went for perch. Ice was supposed to be out but we had to break a bit. Some cold on the water with the breeze. Got a few fatties, 13"" almost      Then Sunday was lake trout and whitefish day  Had to break ice then too    and almost sunk the boat because the ice knocked my plug out..over the floor before I noticed something was amiss    this is my trail I made on the way out...only boat there.    But I got a fish so it was a good day    going to be a couple weeks before I get out again..gotta pick sonny up from school next week"
967649,Acountdeleted,2016-04-25 19:08:00,2562,Wow. Great day. and kudos for toughing out the ice and cold.  I got out a bit on Saturday but Cooch and Simcoe were a little to windy for my Kayak so I only fished for about 15 minutes before I called her a day. Was still nice to get out on the water.
967661,Sinker,2016-04-25 20:01:00,8692,Pretty wild that the ice pulled the plug out....never had that happen before. Lucky your bilge worked LOL. I always have a spare plug in the boat brand new in the package.  Thats dedication at its finest!  S.
967663,Dara,2016-04-25 20:32:00,3052,I had the plug tied to a small rope in case I hit a log or something. I guess the ice ripping around yanked the rope enough.  I would have been gunning it to shore if things didn't work out quick I was almost out of time to be able to lean over the back and get the plug back in...
967673,Moosebunk,2016-04-25 21:32:00,3970,All that for a fish Dara!?!?!  Of course.
967686,Rod Caster,2016-04-25 22:01:00,5784,Nice smelt feed! Did you get a couple pails worth it just enough for a couple meals?
967703,Joeytier,2016-04-25 23:39:00,3990,"That's a great weekend, nice fish all around.  Were the perch from George?"
967739,Dara,2016-04-26 12:14:00,3052,"Just a couple inches of smelts in the bottom of the pail...enough for a feed and a bit of bait for pike and lake trout. Down around the bays at Pine Island Joey.  Really wasn't that much work Moose. The boat breaks the ice just fine and the cold just means you wear a jacket and pants. There was no rain and no wind Sunday, didn't even need to anchor to jig in 80fow..just that silly plug issue made me a tad nervous for a few minutes. And, every place I fished is less that an hour from getting in the truck to getting in the boat."
967741,porkpie,2016-04-26 12:40:00,2521,Sounds like a good long weekend of fishing to me!
967752,msp,2016-04-26 14:16:00,1336,Nice boat ! I have the exact same one. I insert the drain plug from the inside.
967755,Dara,2016-04-26 14:29:00,3052,"It was on the inside originally but its in a hard spot to get at. After this, I'm putting it back inside and carrying a spare in case it comes out on the inside."
967794,DRIFTER_016,2016-04-26 20:02:00,10439,I put mine on the outside but use this type: http://www.canadiantire.ca/en/pdp/shoreline-marine-brass-twist-drain-plug-1-in-0792427p.html#.Vx_Ij_krJhE Much smaller chance of it accidentally coming out. I also carry a spare at the helm in case of emergencies. And a couple more packed away in one of my storage areas for good measure.  One of these would be even better but a bit of a pain to remove and replace. http://www.canadiantire.ca/en/pdp/shoreline-marine-garboard-plug-0792432p.html#.Vx_JC_krJhE
967796,Dara,2016-04-26 20:26:00,3052,Thanks drifter. I kinda like that t handle one. I will be carrying a spare from now on. I rarely ever take the plug out because the boat gets stored inside and doesn't get rain in it. Bilge pump takes care of anything when I'm in it. It sure got a workout Sunday...ran for 20 minutes at least
967843,can u fish,2016-04-27 11:40:00,326,That was quite the weekend you had Dara I am sure you could not get that plug in fast enough thanks for the report and photos.
