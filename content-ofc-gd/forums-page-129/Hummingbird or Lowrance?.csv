But you should probably contact Lowrance or Radio World if you want to be 100% certain.  From what I understand the new MotorGuides have much better control than the MinnKotas.

Ive decided what Im gonna do though. Im gong to put my old 570 bird on the bow and a new unit 7"" at least at the helm. So while waiting to go to AO I noticed that radio world has the Hummmingbird 959ci HD DI on sale for $899 down from $1415. Thoughts?"

967827,landry,2016-04-27 00:50:00,1005,That price isn't so amazing though as in the winter the 999 SI units were $999 at Sail. I have the 859 unit. It marks fish well and marks jigs in water over 60' better than my lowrance did.
962302,Steve,2016-03-13 15:50:00,2075,"From my experience, even the new HDS models still only gets two to three years on them before the sensitivity starts decreasing.  The biggest cause is the towing/trailering....If you don't cover up the bottom of the transducer (ie, with a sock, or similar) the gravel and dirt/dust will start to scratch the base."
962303,grimsbylander,2016-03-13 15:55:00,3016,Go to a shop(s) and play with multiple units of both brands on demo mode. This will not replicate on the water performance but it'll give you an idea of which layout you prefer. Your personal satisfaction of the performance difference between the units will depend more on you than the units. I know fellows with $2500 units that never take time to learn them (either brand) and then blame the graph. It's a very competitive market with no secrets between HB and Lowrance. Try to look past some of the myths you'll read posted and just buy one you feel comfortable with. That way you'll invest the time up front to understand it and maximize its usefulness for your style of fishing.
962305,Old Ironmaker,2016-03-13 16:18:00,8243,It's like asking which is better Chevy or Ford? For what you describe to need I believe Hummingbird of which I have for my main GPS/Sonar. I also have Lowrance on the front and a second screen at the helm which is an old Garmin. I like the Hummingbird for it's simplicity and value for the dollar. Yes get the largest screen in your budget.

I just can't get a bird to do what my lowrance units do. Sure you pay more, but you get what you pay for.  I also know a few people with broken down humminbirds.

You can't do that on a bird, you just get an option to pick from a menu.

961888,porkpie,2016-03-11 01:26:00,2521,"I've owned humminbird, lowrance and now raymarine.  The early hbirds where junk, but they've come a long way in the last ten years.  For ease of operations in a push button format, I'd say humminbird is pretty hard to beat.  I had a 597 and it was a great unit, I currently use a 385 on the ice and on the tinny at the cottage.  I love the Raymarine touch on my boat, and its really easy to use, but they'll set you back a bit more than your budget.  I never really liked the lowrance elites all that much, but my older lowrance greyscale x85 and x15 where great units.  I think the new lowrance elite 7 TI touchscreen is pretty cool, but again a bit more than you want to spend.  The humminbird helix 7 is on sale with a rebate for $700 and change at bass pro this week.  That includes side imaging and all the bells and whistles.  If I had to pick in that price range, I'd probably go with one of them!  The screen is amazingly bright too and all the familiar humminbird controls.  My non expert 2 cents."

961947,Fishwilly,2016-03-11 12:28:00,206,Another vote for Humminbird. I use a 858 for trolling lake Ontario and it provides all I need.
961953,BassMan11,2016-03-11 13:23:00,583,I have a Lowrance Elite 7($699) at the tiller and a Helix 5 DI ($325) at the bow. I find for 2D sonar the Lowrance looks a lot better then the Hummibird. Down imaging is good on both units. The Helix is much brighter and easier to see from anywhere in the boat.  I like both units and you really can't go wrong with either brand imo. For your price point I would go with the Helix 7.

Both are easy to use if you take the time to read the manuals but the edge will go to Humminbird for customer service. Go do a search for Lowrance customer service and you will see what I mean.

Check them out carefully tho, the list of features changes drastically once you get in to the Helix 9.  Also, some come with compact transducers, some with the HD.

About 2 years ago I was fishing Lake Erie out of Point Abino and met up with my brother in-law who was in his boat. We were slowly trolling with our TM pulling worm harnesses for walleyes.  I kept finding scattered walleyes laying on the bottom and would circle them to get them to bite. Brother in-law kept saying he didn't see anything on the bottom with his Hummingturd..............I shared some of my catch with him.

962293,landry,2016-03-13 14:48:00,1005,I have owned both. Many say Lowrance marks bottom fish better. This is not true. If you turn your sensitivity up too high in a Bird the. Fish will be hard to see and show as bumps. If you turn it down then they will show as green and yellow bumps with a red blip just like a lowrance. The touch screen is better/faster for marking a quick waypoint off to the side on side imaging though.
