967748,captpierre,2016-04-26 13:45:00,2521,Thanks Jimmer. Didn't know about the size limit.
967836,ehg,2016-04-27 05:56:00,2666,"Try throwing float/ white panfish tube jig along very north shoreline from Hurricane Pt. towards Bald lakes. Right along north shoreline is little shallow mud bottom fingers 2-5 ft. of water. Now is good time for searching by flipping float along shore.   Thanks. I'll give it a try in about 10 days when I'm up again.  That is a good weekend. I remember in past these late April/early May weekends as  feasts of Crappie, morels and fiddleheads. Gourmet wild harvest.Yum,Yum."
967910,captpierre,2016-04-28 00:17:00,2521,So I understand the jig for crappie should be just under the float.  6-12 inches. Does the same apply to spring gills? I'm thinking a little lower. What about dropshotting? Or casting mini cranks.
967915,crappieperchhunter,2016-04-28 00:57:00,2582,So I understand the jig for crappie should be just under the float. 6-12 inches. Does the same apply to spring gills? I'm thinking a little lower. What about dropshotting? Or casting mini cranks.  Depends on water depth. I fish both species the same depth wise....usually about half the water depth.  3 FOW I fish 18 inches under the float...5 FOW I fish 30 inches under  the float etc etc.However if I'm specifically targeting gills I don't use plastics I just put about a 1/4-1/2 inch chunk of worm on a bare 1/32 OZ jighead.  I mostly use unpainted jigheads only because that's what I have. Gills don't seem to care about jighead color. I use worms for 2 reasons. One... gills definitely go after worms more...they seem to like having meat. If you are using plastics the gills will hit them for awhile and then stop if you don't move. They seem to get used to the plastic and stop hitting it. They will not stop if you are using worms. Reason #2.... gills tend to tear plastics up. You will go through way more plastics fishing gills then crappie. I just find it very annoying having  a gill pull the tail off a new plastic body on the FIRST CAST. Happens all the time. My routine for gills is I take 3 whole dew worms when I go out for them. I never need more. Even if you are getting bit every cast 3 worms will last 2-3 hours. A dozen worms in the fridge last me 4 weekends at the cottage.
967918,captpierre,2016-04-28 01:17:00,2521,Thanks for this. And taking the time. Will gettum.
967951,Beans,2016-04-28 14:53:00,3339,Eeewwww !...chopping up dew worms...not my cup of tea... my great grandson thinks that is great fun...but gotta admit it does produce lots of bluegills...
967962,GBW,2016-04-28 16:10:00,8460,There is just something to/about a live worm that makes most fish want to eat it. maybe they should make a worm sent spray vs crayfish and or garlic...
967965,BillM,2016-04-28 16:35:00,17367,"I've never found crappie to be on a worm bite, plastics for sure.  Now gills, sunfish and rock bass?  Worms all day."
968110,ecmilley,2016-04-30 11:37:00,2163,"worms or pinhead minnows on cold front days seem to get the crappies going, but otherwise jigs and maribou always come through for me"
968116,crappieperchhunter,2016-04-30 13:01:00,2582,If I'm fishing an area with crappies and gills I always start with plastic. I let the fish dictate how my day will turn out. If I start getting bigger gills the plastic comes off the jighead and a chunk of worm goes on.  In all the years I have fished this way I have caught maybe 3 crappie once the plastic comes off and none of these 3 incidentals where big enough to keep. My experience has always been they have no interest in worms at all. Perhaps my worm offerings are to small for them to be interested in.
967401,captpierre,2016-04-23 13:18:00,2521,Got the cottage open. Nobody out on the lake. No panfish hangin around the dock. Tried for crappie in past springs with no luck. Never catch one fishing for eyes. Catch lots of bluegills under floats in shallow bays. Is there a decent crappie population in the north end?
967404,Beans,2016-04-23 15:19:00,3339,"There was before they opened the lake for ice-fishing...First spring afterwards the crappie dropped right off...They are still around but nowhere near the numbers we used to catch...  I don't get around much nowadays except down to the shoreline at our park and haven't had a bite in two outings...water is too cold yet...Normally, in years past this weekend would have been the opening week of fishing on the lake and that is when we did well for crappie until the pickerel season opened then the crappie fishing died off..."
967408,NANUK,2016-04-23 16:30:00,797,"You want water temps around 50 deg, target dark bottom bays with brush pile and structure like docks etc. depending on water temps you can almost site fish them."

967462,captpierre,2016-04-24 00:55:00,2521,Thanks. I'll give it a try in about 10 days when I'm up again.
967463,captpierre,2016-04-24 00:55:00,2521,Thanks. Will try that.
967465,ecmilley,2016-04-24 01:02:00,2163,Lots and lots. Not as good as a couple years ago keep moving around you ll find them
967466,crappieperchhunter,2016-04-24 01:09:00,2582,Catch lots of bluegills under floats in shallow bays.  Why don't you stick with the bluegills? I like catching crappie...don't get me wrong....but for a feed of fish I will take gills every time over crappie. If I am catching both....like in an area I fish on Little Bald....I just let all the crappie go and keep gills for a fish fry. If you haven't gave them an honest try your missing out IMHO. And they are easier to find and catch ALL summer long.

We were catching 4 gills to every crappie all day long.
967476,Dan668,2016-04-24 02:04:00,1120,"Ive never really fished for panfish. Got one 5 years ago,  a crappie, that was 15"" on a bass jig lol. This was caught on north pigeon. The size shocked me.  Ive used 3"" grubs before with some success, should i be downsizing? May take a friend to catch a feed,  maybe the first time i keep a catch!"
967501,206,2016-04-24 13:03:00,563,Water temps still down the bluegill have moved in but the crappy seem to be a lil shy still. Water temp comes up you'll get more crappy shallow.

Fairly soon after we moved up this way I was crappie fishing near an OFC'Rs father and noticed all he caught was slabs...we were using 1 1/2 inch grubs and tubes but his were about 3 inches...I guess he knew sumpin'  we didn't...LOL"
967589,KawarthaGuy,2016-04-25 01:28:00,46,Had luck in the Blind Channel a few years back w tubes under a bobber.  Also surprised to see that the channel has been closed off and no longer navigable from end to end.
967591,captpierre,2016-04-25 01:31:00,2521,Thanks. Don't know where the Blind Channel is. Never heard of it
967595,KawarthaGuy,2016-04-25 01:42:00,46,"Hey Captain,  This map shows the Narrows heading into Buckhorn.  The Blind Channel runs off the Narrows on the north side.  The water is shallow w lots of wood you can cast to.  Should be good now.  I was there on Walleye Opener and still caught Crappie."

Who wants to keep something that small? But once I learned a few spots where you can consistantly get larger ones 7.5 inches and up and  actually ate a few I realized I liked them much better then crappie and really it only takes a couple more  fish to make a good feed.

It's also important to remember that there is a specific limit in zone 17 for bluegill over 7.1"".  I think an angler is permitted 30 out of their overall limit."
