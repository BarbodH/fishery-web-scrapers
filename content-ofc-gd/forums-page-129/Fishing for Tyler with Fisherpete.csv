What a super nice guy and hell of a fisherman, unfortunately the fish could have cooperated a bit more but we still managed 9 fish and had a mixed bag of weather so a succesful day and made a new friend, helped a charity and put 9 in the boat!!! Massive day thanks Pete!!!!"
967499,aplumma,2016-04-24 12:59:00,6896,Just as I suspected another happy friend of Pete. Thanks again Pete for your generous donation of your time and thanks to Shloim for supporting Tyler.   Art

967609,Big Cliff,2016-04-25 12:03:00,6899,9 in the boat great to hear you had a wonderful day!
967618,Fisherpete,2016-04-25 14:19:00,1814,"Thanks again Sheldon for your generous bid. The fishing wasn't crazy but we did manage 9 and you and Mike put a few nice ones in the boat, 17 3/4 and 15 being the best 2. The evening bite was pretty solid from 7-10pm - the boys in our second boat landed 6 fish in a row all over 15lbs at one point. My brother in my boat managed a PB also at 18. I'll post the pics here today or tomorrow. Cheers!  Pete"
