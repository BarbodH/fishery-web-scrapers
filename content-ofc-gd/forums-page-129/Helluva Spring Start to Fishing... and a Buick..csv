I need to borrow that one, I'll give you due credit for it for sure.  That Buick is identical to my Dad's he bought back in 2001. Century. Great car for her, not sexy but very nice safe solid car. The 3.8 can not be killed. Keep an eye on the torque converter. Change tranny fluid every 80K. The only problem he had was the harmonic ?? can't remember right now Oldtimers disease, balancer maybe. I drove it down to Florida and back for them every year for 8 years, great ride, cushy, well like a Buick. Not bad on gas either."

I'll be keeping an eye on things for her and she'll hopefully be responsible with the car and, respectful of the privilege to drive and the new freedoms that will allow her. Agreed, do think that the car is a great starter and those seats are like Lazyboys compared to most car seats today, I'd have been happy to have it at her age.  Her late Grandmother who's car it was, would be happy to see her in it as well. Summer was hoping for either a Mercedes, BMW or would even settle for a Mazda but instead she gets what most other kids don't, a tape deck in a Buick.  Looking forward to driving as her passenger so I can dig out some tunes from my youth."

967376,Joeytier,2016-04-23 00:28:00,3990,"Nice job on your first brownie excursion, they are a ton of fun and wicked aggressive this time of year.  Now go find your red(horse) whale."

Didn't come to mind ti'll after when I got curious. It went home with me though, five of them did. And cleaning it I'd have to say it was probably about 22 give or take, and fat with eggs.  You're right though, what a great muskie bait that could have been alive. Now stripped it's laker and pike candy.  Nice job on your first brownie excursion, they are a ton of fun and wicked aggressive this time of year.  Now go find your red(horse) whale.  Thanks! And yeah, I might have to go find those big reds yet."
967477,emjay88,2016-04-24 02:57:00,70,Great looking steelhead! Hard to beat the fight of a spunky fresh chromer!!
967706,BassMan11,2016-04-26 00:15:00,583,Great report Bunk. Thanks for sharing.  51000k on a 16 year old car is quite something lol. I am sure your daughter will love it.
967774,Moosebunk,2016-04-26 16:57:00,3970,"Great report Bunk. Thanks for sharing.  51000k on a 16 year old car is quite something lol. I am sure your daughter will love it.  My Grandmother passed in November at 90 years of age. She was still golfing and curling a little into her late 70's maybe early 80's, and always grew a great garden of fresh veggies. She lived in town and would walk everywhere and always for everything, unless the sidewalks were slippy with ice or snowed in. She fell asleep one night and didn't wake the next morning. The perfect way to go, just as she lived.  But the car, yeah it sure got little use from a woman like her... Summer already loves the fact that she's no longer so trapped at home in the country anymore and has more freedom to roam."
967790,BassMan11,2016-04-26 18:47:00,583,Sorry to hear Bunk. But yes that is probably the perfect way to go.. if there is one.  I remember that first car freedom... it is a glorious feeling.
967815,bigbuck,2016-04-26 23:25:00,2449,Nice pics Bunk!! Your daughter will love to hate her car. It will be cheap reliable and comfy transpo for her. I've got an '03 Regal that has been ridiculously cheap and reliable for me.
967817,Moosebunk,2016-04-26 23:34:00,3970,"She took me for a short ride in it tonight Buck. Those seats are soooo comfy.    She asked me to go jogging with her as she needs to cut two more pounds to make her fight weight for a Ju Jitsu tournament this weekend. Hadn't run in a couple years and after a couple miles before supper, probably won't run again for a couple more. Sweating is exhausting.  Best part was after we finished, she drove my dead arse home while I just sat in a comfy seat."

LOL  Will go for walks, hikes, climbs and crawls anytime, but jogs and runs require just too much... lol  Now if I was her I'd want a BMW too, why not?  But as her dad I'd rather see her work hard for those bigger and better things. And she has been, so hopefully she gets to that place on her own some day. Until then, she'll be riding in that beauty old Buick.  Thanks Bri!"
