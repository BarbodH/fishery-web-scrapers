Anyone else notice this? Never had a problem with any of their transducer cables being pinched.

967382,Big Cliff,2016-04-23 01:11:00,6899,"Something doesn't sound right; my cable comes off the top of my transducer, Are you sure you are reading the instructions correctly?"
967399,wkrp,2016-04-23 12:34:00,656,Take a look at the manual and you will see what I mean . I had no issue with my installation because I ran the cable beside the mounting bracket.
