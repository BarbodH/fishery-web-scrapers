968052,Can_38,2016-04-29 19:41:00,152,Started to use the atlas to simply look around and discovered 'general use' areas on my home lake near Minden.  Curious what the situation is when the atlas clearly shows a plot of land as 'general use' but it has an established cottage with dock etc.. Is the Atlas simply wrong?
968073,hunteronwheels,2016-04-29 22:01:00,112,they probably have a crown land lease for a portion
968093,chris.brock,2016-04-30 01:14:00,4053,"No, the leased lands (like for hunt camps on crown land) show up as private lands in this atlas.  I think those are actually little crown land plots (general use) BETWEEN the cottages. This website is super handy."

968181,Can_38,2016-05-01 03:14:00,152,I was looking to take the son out for a camp night on a piece of crown vs. In cottage.  Some good general use spots ex: islands have cottages.
