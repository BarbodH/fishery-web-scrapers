967883,SirCranksalot,2016-04-27 18:24:00,3291,The Notty is definitely a navigable waterway---NVCA publishes a canoe route map for the river!
967889,BillM,2016-04-27 19:05:00,17367,I'd bet the Ganny is also classified as the same.   Would be interesting to hear what a local CO thinks.
967890,esoxansteel,2016-04-27 19:41:00,1307,"They have float your fanny down the Ganny from Sylvan Glen right through Twomeys property so i guess its all condsidered navitatible, especially when the town thinks they can make a buck, or Twomey can sell a gallon of maple syrup, its all dollars and cents, at the expense of the annual steelhead run, as the Fanny Float many times coincides with the peak of the run. Why anyone would pay a landowner like Twomey or anyone else looking to profit, big bucks to fish for marked up, skinny, tail worn, spawned out kelps, is beyond me, shear utter looganism IMO"

967521,misfish,2016-04-24 17:48:00,29133,"I had to go into Angus to get the grandaughter and was early, so made the right turn before the bridge. I guess the owner has had enough and I for one, do not blame them. Big red dots on trees,no tresspassing sign and a chain across the walk entrance. Talking to a local that was fishing on the edge of the property line, he said the owner had enough. From what I heard, an angler that was fishing the already posted no tresspassing further down, was asked to leave. His response was not friendly.So now you have a 50 yard shore line to fish on the north side of the bridge. WELL DONE,WELL DONE.Keep this crap up, and you will lose the south side as well. Myself I dont care, as I dont fish there. It dose sadden me the ignorance of people and the ones that feel the need to leave thier trash behind.      "

967535,Kerry,2016-04-24 19:56:00,383,"I personally don't know why people have to take anything at all with them that they would throw away as an afterthought in this day and age.I go fishing I use a thermos and my lunch is packed in a bag which is used to take anything loose with me.I don't bother with live bait anymore with all the bio products available.I use the same philosophy whether I am shore, boat or ice fishing. Property owners have only one way of curtailling the problem and that is to block it off to public access and of course this doesn't just apply to fishing as it is the same problem wherever use of private land is allowed for public trails too.They do have the right to protect their investment, just sad that some elements feel they can trash the world and walk away.

The land was open to all back before I moved to Barrie 25+ years ago. They even let people use thier home property to store thier tin boats to launch on the Notty. About 15 years ago, they tried to make things easy for those that felt the need to leave trash. They put out large steel drums for trash and even put a porto potty. Sign posted, keep it clean. Last chance. Saddley, some dicks decided it would be fun to set the porto on fire. This was the end of above said. CLOSED OFF. From then til this past fall, the rest was open. Now like said, CLOSED CLOSED CLOSED TO ALL.  I have a nice private public allowed, access spot that has been posted, KEEP IT CLEAN OR LOSE IT. Shame if they do, as it,s a spot I like to visit a few times in the fall. I can only take so much trash out with me the few times I visit it."

Its amazing the odd spots you will find trash or where a party went on in some weird part if the bush. We even found a couch a few years back and I had to wonder how it got in there? Its thick enough bush its hard to walk through for 5km, howd a friggen couch get out there lol"
