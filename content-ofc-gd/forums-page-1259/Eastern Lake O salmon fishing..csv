42746,Eddyk,2007-03-03 22:41:00,195,I started salmon fishing around Port Hope last year and loved it. In a couple of weeks Im moving to the Rideau Lakes north of Kingston. My question is do the salmon run in the eastern extremes of Lake Ontario. The lake basically ends just west of Kingston.

42799,Smokey,2007-03-04 00:25:00,1278,I know they catch them off Brighton and Quinte area so I can't see why they wouldn't be that little bit further.
42877,POLLIWOGG,2007-03-04 04:33:00,835,"They get a few showing up early July at Main Duck . Try to search the Kingston Charter boats, I think one of them is U -catch em or something like that, if you can find one of their web sites you might get a good Idea of where they fish them and what times of year. As far as I know the Kingston boats makes the run to Main Duck or trailer to Wellington but I don't see why you couldn't find them closer to Kingston."
42925,Eddyk,2007-03-04 12:33:00,195,thanks guys. Irishfield. Ive already driven to the village of Charelston and it has a beautiful boat launch in a park and the lake is dotted with islands and bays with very few cottages. It looks great.
