42871,danc,2007-03-04 04:14:00,4677,"You guys are too kind. It was only a for fun contest that takes place monthly on my photography forum. I only posted my result because it was a fishing photo. Thanks again guys.  Anyways, some of you wanted to see the winning photo for the month. So, here it is. Remember, it isn't a fishing site. It's a great photo.  "
42875,bpsbassman,2007-03-04 04:24:00,941,"A great photo, but yours was way better!! Probably was the fact that Spiel was in the picture which dropped it down a rung. Well deserved bud.  Your photography is always number one on this site."

42612,danc,2007-03-03 16:24:00,4677,"It was just for fun, but I was thrilled to get second place in a photo contest hosted by a photography web site that I frequent. The theme was ""Other Hobbies"". So I entered a photo that I took last fall when Spiel and TEP were here. In the photo are TEP, Sis and my friend Joe out for an early morning troll.  It's nice to be recognized by your peers. Here's the original.    And the award that I won.  "

42707,danc,2007-03-03 21:30:00,4677,"Hey, thanks everyone. I guess what makes this special for me is the fact that the good people at this particular web site have a passion for photography and their pictures are showing their other hobbies. For me, fishing is my passion and the photography is my hobby. There are some very good photographers that belong to this site. It's kinda like an OFC for photography."
42723,pameladallaire,2007-03-03 22:04:00,470,I think you should expand your entering into bigger contests Dan.  I think you would be surprised how good you are compared to some.  You have a very good eye for photography!  Pam
