This movie is non-stop action, whacked out camera work, heart pounding audio and truly laugh-out-loud scenes and dialogue. Never seen anything like this. Watch this movie, tell me what you think and then watch it again... gotta go, time to watch it with the directors commentary.  -Brian  http://imdb.com/title/tt0479884/ Plot summary for Crank (2006) advertisement Chev Chelios is a professional assassin working for the West Coast crime syndicate.
