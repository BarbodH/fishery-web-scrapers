41893,irishfield,2007-03-02 01:38:00,26272,Here's the panned out shot to give you more prospective on the location    and John..what am I gonna do with you. Shawanaga Inlet looking in towards Point au Baril Station
41899,GbayGiant,2007-03-02 01:48:00,1780,Told you wouldn't even know if it was my home town.  I fish that area all the time. Hahaha.
41906,fishforfun,2007-03-02 01:56:00,105,"The Shawanaga pic was a tough one too, so directly to the right would be Dillon and Shebeshkebong Bay? As for the panned out shot still no go and to think we boated out of Wye Heritage 20 yrs ago!"
41907,irishfield,2007-03-02 01:56:00,26272,"Should be quite a few here that know the last one above. Generally where huts first get put out in the Midland area.  And John...I sure hope you can at least read a map...or leave bread crumbs or something....  I really like this one..entitled ""First Tracks""  "
41916,GbayGiant,2007-03-02 02:06:00,1780," To funny. I really stink at these birds eye views, but I can navigate this whole area at night with one eye shut, except for that one rock I hit last year (jk)  I'll have to start learning the names to, I feel bad because people out in their boats stop and ask me where certain things are and I have no idea, even though I do know how to get there but don't remember the names..lol   Unless they have a map."

Now if someone can name the bay in the picture above I'm sure at least 800 people here would love to see an end to this stupid thread....   ...including my wife that has watched me do nothing else for 24 hours!  Last hint...that is one of only two remaining grain elevators in the Midland area.
41924,tinbanger,2007-03-02 02:20:00,1028,Midland Bay = No Muskie
41926,irishfield,2007-03-02 02:23:00,26272,No Dave....I already posted the other elevator over in Midland Harbour    ..so this one is and what's the bay?
41927,tinbanger,2007-03-02 02:27:00,1028,well I was half right !  Been there just can't think of the name  TB
41932,tinbanger,2007-03-02 02:36:00,1028,Last guess  Victoria Harbour ?  TB
41934,irishfield,2007-03-02 02:41:00,26272,"I'll give it to you Dave just to end it...that is the Victoria Harbour marina in foreground...Grain Elevator is Port McNicoll and the bay is ""Hoggs Bay""  I've got one more picture....shows the thin gene pool over Six Mile way.. Note the sled path carefully...  "
41989,JerseyDog,2007-03-02 05:30:00,190,"To funny. I really stink at these birds eye views, but I can navigate this whole area at night with one eye shut, except for that one rock I hit last year (jk)  ONLY ONE ROCK? ALL OF LAST YEAR? THAT'S DAMN GOOD."

42064,AzuluSpookd,2007-03-02 13:50:00,348,Whites Falls...nice thread wayne....I like the pic of my work....
42106,irishfield,2007-03-02 15:11:00,26272,That's the dam on Six Mile...flowing into Gloucester Pool. Where the road runs from the 400 to Severn Bridge.  Open water running on a sled is one thing...but where you're gonna get pulled under the ice when you fall off another..  Glad I could bring you back out of the wood work 'Spookd !
42264,majorlifts,2007-03-02 21:54:00,171,"Thats what I like about this board Im always guaranteed a good laugh.  Only thing is I think a new pair of drawers is in order when Irish is about, damn near piss myself laughin."
42285,irishfield,2007-03-02 22:41:00,26272,My problem is I'm never sure if they're laughin with me...or at me ....

41728,irishfield,2007-03-01 20:25:00,26272,Nope the second shot is taken looking South/East..and you can see both Penetang and Midland Harbours in the top of the picture...heck I can even see the narrows to go into Matchedash Bay on the horizon.  So now that Martin has gone to dig out his GBay Charts....in the first picture...that is Beausoleil Island in the top right qt of the picture and I'm headin East at this point..
41734,Rob,2007-03-01 20:32:00,467,Awenda PP Kettle lake  Rob C
41740,irishfield,2007-03-01 20:37:00,26272,Park is correct and sorry..just grabbed my own charts and didn't realize that was called Methodist Point Figured that would be over by Methodist Island LOL. Lake is wrong though. Kettle and Pine I believe are the two lakes in the park. What is the bigger lake to the right of them.
41742,fishforfun,2007-03-01 20:41:00,105,Dang had to climb in the attic and get my Richardsons chart book out! Rob knows his stuff other than fishing with you in the fall haven't boated this end of the bay in 10 years.
41746,irishfield,2007-03-01 20:44:00,26272,"LOL Martin..and what did I just post... ""now that Martin has gone looking for his charts..."" LOL  And there are two correct answers to the name of the lake in question..."
41749,Rob,2007-03-01 20:47:00,467,"I love to fish around thunder bay and Christian Island, awesome salmon fishing, and very close to shore. Too bad so many poorly marked gill nets. Irish, other than Cedar Pointe, where else can you launch a boat (14') around that area? Love to start going back up there again this year, but that launch at Cedar Point is brutal.  Rob C"
41758,irishfield,2007-03-01 21:04:00,26272,"Not sure where else, if any you can launch Rob. Don't think there is a launch on the Sawlog Beach end of Champlain Road. Cedar point is your only safe hope in a 14'r though with the shelter of Christian Island from the main lake  The Lake in the picture is Farlain Lake or Cook's Lake for the older folks that know it. I lived on it in a cottage, without indoor plumbing, the first year we had the plant in town. Leah hand dug a tile bed, I renovated the whole place and drove a sand point well. 20 years later I wish I still had it.  This Island is a favourite for bikini watchin and swimmin. Someone may wade out to you and say ""$10 for mouring on Indian Land"".  "
41764,fishforfun,2007-03-01 21:20:00,105,"Beckwith Island, spent many nights swinging on the hook there."

Thunder Beach looking in and Thunder beach looking out with Christian Island left, Beckwith right and Hope Island behind it...and open water as far as the eye can see. That ship will be breakin out of Midland Harbour in no time...   "

41824,irishfield,2007-03-01 23:08:00,26272,"LOL WJ...not much to hit up there and the airplane purdy much flies itself..or at least it seems to after 12 years in the same bird.  I'm confident most here know that last picture is the longest fresh water beach...Wasaga and Woodland and Bluewater closest in the shot..  What is the name of the ""bump"" in the beach's curve?"
41825,GbayGiant,2007-03-01 23:08:00,1780,"Cool pics Wayne, you could probably take a picture directly over my home town and wouldn't know what it was.  It's a whole new perspective with the birds eye view.  Was there another fish under that Montreal Canadians flag ?"
41832,fishforfun,2007-03-01 23:24:00,105,Spratt point.
41837,irishfield,2007-03-01 23:32:00,26272,You still got that chart book out Martin? LOL  Name the two islands in this shot  
41844,fishforfun,2007-03-01 23:46:00,105,Not a visible land mark but from our fall troll Present and Snake? It gets a lot tougher when arial photos are north of Parry Sound then the memory is put to the test with so many bays and Islands!
41847,irishfield,2007-03-01 23:52:00,26272,"Yes correct..Present in the foreground..snake the little strip of trees and midland harbour in the far right.  We can do the whole GB coast up to the French if you like...LOL  Got a couple left. What ""bay"" is this  "
41851,GbayGiant,2007-03-02 00:01:00,1780,Just a question Wayne. Almost every day out fishing I see at least 1 or 2 planes fly over fairly low and I usually always wave. ( I'll keep an eye out for your green machine )  Do you see us waving ?   Grew up in the Beach area a didn't even get that one.
41856,fishforfun,2007-03-02 00:13:00,105,Ok got me don't recognize it at all   Sailors don't spend a lot of time on docks LOL.
41859,irishfield,2007-03-02 00:21:00,26272,I wing wag back to a lot of fisherman that wave. Depends where you're looking at the time I guess as to whether they'll see you or not.  Still waiting on the picture above...but just for you John.. where is this?  
41862,irishfield,2007-03-02 00:25:00,26272, I have another shot panned out that would give it away pretty quick ! It's a popular venue for early season ice fishing....
41433,irishfield,2007-03-01 03:21:00,26272,"Sure now you tell me Mikeh ! LOL  Double light there actually...or at least there was the last time I paid attention.  As for the picture..no I said Georgian Bay, after you've gone well past Admiral trolling. I put the Six Mile to Gloucester in the ""new boat/six mile"" thread.  Also note the slush in the picture. The only lake that didn't look tretcherous for slush is Six Mile..so stay on the trails if you're heading out on the lakes.  ANOTHER hint for this one. Use to be an exit off hwy 69 named after this spot..."
41461,JerseyDog,2007-03-01 05:44:00,190,"That's South Bay Honey Habour, up to Baxter Lake.  Oh, and the fishing is terrible there. Not worth the bother."
41518,fishforfun,2007-03-01 13:16:00,105,Is that the entrance to Go home Bay?
41521,trapshooter,2007-03-01 13:25:00,1234,"You forgot Honey Harbour Boat Club next to Admiral's.  That's where our family keeps our boat wayne.  We've got a cottage on Portage Island, just around the corner from Franceville!  It's yellow, can't miss it."
41536,Squid,2007-03-01 14:10:00,1656,Four dead fish!! That is funny Wayne!!
41566,irishfield,2007-03-01 16:10:00,26272,Yep Jersey Dog knows the spot....and yah don't bother..there's no fish there..no bass on the shoals of Jack's Rock either LOL....rope might be my bait of choice in the bay shown.  Here's the next one..EASY  
41567,Raf,2007-03-01 16:15:00,3495,"I heart driving by there every single time Wayne.  Everyone else in the vehicle, no matter how many times they've gone by will turn their neck westwards."
41573,trapshooter,2007-03-01 16:21:00,1234,"Is that at port severn, just south of Muskoka Rd 5 at the 400?"
41584,JerseyDog,2007-03-01 16:33:00,190,I say Waubashene with a view into Matchedash Bay. No fish there either.
41593,irishfield,2007-03-01 16:42:00,26272,I do the same thing to this day Raf. Always look out to see if the place on the island to the right is STILL for sale. Yes this is the lock out of Little Lake/Gloucester Pool into Georgian Bay...flowing under the 400 bridges. You can see it a bit in the picture...but my full size picture has an neat optical illusion to it. Looks like snow is flowing out from between the two roadways and the channel to the left actuall looks like a waterfall flowing from the Gbay side down into the area between the locks and the bridges.  Oh and remember that area between the bridges and the locks is a sancutuary for part of the season guys..at least the area where the bypass flow is coming in from the right.
41605,irishfield,2007-03-01 17:09:00,26272,"What were you saying Jersey Dog....    This is looking in at Waub and Matchedash Bay. The ""clutter"" in the lower part of the pic is around a hundred huts. Anyone fishing here be very cautious of the extreme current under the ice here. Could be a foot thick where you're standin and 2 inches three feet away."
41619,irishfield,2007-03-01 18:03:00,26272,"Okay..this one isn't really fishing related in any way...well one OFC'r works there...but  When I'm flying kids on Young Eagles flights I always say ""Hey Look....the Penetang Ferris Wheel fell over"" !  "
41621,lew,2007-03-01 18:06:00,12767,Maximum security prison
41626,irishfield,2007-03-01 18:14:00,26272,"Yes and no Lew. The older building in the foreground is Oak Ridges..prison for those that claimed to be insane when they committed their crime. Basically the most dangerous offenders in Canada..murderers etc. The ""ferris wheel"" is the new super jail for 2 years less a day and for holding scum like the mother that killed her two kids in Barrie last year while she awaits trial.  Midland Harbour in top of pic and I took the shot from about where your Dad rented the cottage years ago.  Here's a better shot of the entire PRIME Penetang Waterfront property...that we effectionately refer to as the ""Penetang Hilton"" around here. At least they don't come up from Barrie on Tuesdays to do labotomies(sp) anymore.....  "

41641,irishfield,2007-03-01 18:52:00,26272,LOL Tackle Buster...right answer... 20 hours late! That's why I typed find the lastest picture before answering below that shot of the marine rail.  Now...do you guys/gals want me to continue...or should I just shut up now???
41663,fishforfun,2007-03-01 19:23:00,105,"Heck we've got near white out conditions here in G'town. So I will spend the next few hrs cancelling hockey games all over the province. Why not, gives me something to do between calls"
41666,irishfield,2007-03-01 19:27:00,26272,"Well I really should get into the shop and do some work...but it is 2:30 already..what's the point!  The ""Honourable"" Paul Martin is visiting what for the winter...  "
41670,fishforfun,2007-03-01 19:30:00,105,The grain elevators in Midland.
41675,irishfield,2007-03-01 19:37:00,26272,Yep ADM Milling. Smells like porrage most of the time on the waterfront.  BTW..here's a better shot of the mural for those that have never seen it..    Which OFC'rs house is this with the BIG fence around the yard.  
41677,lew,2007-03-01 19:37:00,12767," Our cottage was actually right on the north shore of the bay Wayne, sorta kitty-corner from the prison.  There's a big white wooden cross on the shore, supposedly marking the spot where the indians killed some Jesuit priests back in the day.......we were about 500' west of the cross.  Be great to see an aerial picture if you have one."
41684,irishfield,2007-03-01 19:46:00,26272,I didn't type that too clear Lew. Midland harbour was in the top of the picture frame. Where I was in the airplane when I took the picture was right over top of the cross location on the North shore of Penetang Harbour where it dog legs out to open waters...about where you dad rented your hideaway.  Best I can do for now Lew. Will get a closer shot of the shoreline if I get out again.  and looking North up Penetang Bay to the shore you were on 
41690,lew,2007-03-01 19:54:00,12767,"OK Wayne, thanks, I've got it figured out now, it's a totally different perspective from the air.  We had a few good years up there when we were kids.  I actually took my bike up there a few years ago and toured the whole area. Started in Penetang and went up the west shore to where the cross is, then back to town and up the east shore to the hospital.  Lots of changes, but plenty of good memories too."
41699,irishfield,2007-03-01 20:01:00,26272,So..Which OFC'rs house is this with the BIG fence around the yard.  
41712,fishforfun,2007-03-01 20:09:00,105,Big fence with razor wire Roys or any mod LOL. No must be Maureens.

41353,Tybo,2007-03-01 01:32:00,1373,Would it be in the Port seven area.
41357,irishfield,2007-03-01 01:35:00,26272,Darn Paul..you want the location...not okay when I gave it to lew but now you want it..LOL  Closer to say Honey Harbour...
41359,lew,2007-03-01 01:40:00,12767,"hmmmm, I've trolled right past the front door of that place a couple times with gbfisher but darned if I know what it's called.  Waltonian Inn maybe ??"

41371,Bernie,2007-03-01 01:57:00,3190,I cant tell. Somebody deleted the name on the building.
41373,Rob,2007-03-01 01:59:00,467,Don't know the name but it is the marina around the corner (north) of Dellawana Inn. I know cause I passed out on top of the roof of that marina with some friends that worked there back in the mid 80's!! Crazy Days!   Rob C

41277,lew,2007-02-28 23:23:00,12767,Kirkfield ??
41279,irishfield,2007-02-28 23:28:00,26272,Nope..right idea though...

41282,irishfield,2007-02-28 23:34:00,26272,Yes Lew..it's the Big Chute Marine Rail out of Glouster Pool into the Severn System. Severn Bridge I guess is the village.  I'll finish my supper and dig up another one...
