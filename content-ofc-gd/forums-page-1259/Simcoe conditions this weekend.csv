42165,tbayboy,2007-03-02 17:49:00,1497,"Hey everyone, hoping to hit the ice this weekend but wondering what all this snow/rain/slush/warmth is going to do to the ice.  Anyone have any thoughts on whether the conditions will be dangerous this weekend anywhere (I'll be walking so near shore stuff)?  Sean"
42173,irishfield,2007-03-02 18:08:00,26272,Gonna be real wet out there if Barrie got what we got last night. 7 or 8 inches of soaking wet snow and freezing rain on top. Add to that a nuclear melt down out there at about 5C right now and that's going to equal HUGE slush on top of what was already there. Stick to the hard packed main trail and fish beside it would be my bet.
42187,tbayboy,2007-03-02 18:50:00,1497,"Your probably right, following a sled trail out along with some very waterproof boots, maybe I should drag a little tinny out and float in it ."
42204,ryanheritage,2007-03-02 19:47:00,180,bring lots of plastic bags......... it might be the only way to keep your feet dry..I don't think its a good time on the ice this weekend. oh yeah wear a life jacket.
42229,misfish,2007-03-02 20:51:00,29133,"I havent been on the lake for a couple of weeks.  After shoveling and plowing snow this morning  ,I would say theres going to be LOTS of water under dat der snow.It,s going to be sloppy out there,and by the looks of the forcast temps,it aint going to harden up anytime soon.  And to add,all that wieght is going to push the water up out of the holes.  Care and caution out there."
42241,BFSC Kevin,2007-03-02 21:10:00,1351,"aw man, i was hoping of heading out for tomorrow morning. from the looks and sounds of it, doesn't seem like a bright idea.. shucks!"
42262,tbayboy,2007-03-02 21:49:00,1497,"I'm starting to agree with you Kevin, think I might just take a wait and see approach .  Maybe it'll be better by Sunday, if anyone does get out or heres any hands on reports please let us know.  Sean"
42282,tinbanger,2007-03-02 22:27:00,1028,"Just got back in (Minets point area )and the conditions are fine,very little slush and its supposed to cool down on the weekend. Go for it it'll be gone in a few weeks 1/2 doz perch and a few Smelt for our troubles.  TB"
