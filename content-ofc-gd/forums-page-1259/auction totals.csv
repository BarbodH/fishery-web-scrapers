42596,Ron,2007-03-03 15:46:00,1683,I don't understand why it was pulled either. Maybe it could have been locked and people could see who the winners were.
42597,Gerritt,2007-03-03 15:49:00,6129,"my guess is it wasnt pulled just set to invisible until the winners have been contacted and arrangements made etc.... It would be nice to see a thread that posts the winners name, and they amount the winning bid was. My guess is we will see this thread shortly.   Gerritt."
