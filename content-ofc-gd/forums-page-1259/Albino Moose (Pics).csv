42268,Basskicker,2007-03-02 22:05:00,421,My Uncle from back home (Newfoundland) sent me these pictures.  Simply incredible...I have seen over 500 moose...but never albino. The chances of seeing 1 albino is extremely rare.....but 2 on the same day....unbelievable.  Hope you enjoy these......  Jason

42272,Gerritt,2007-03-02 22:15:00,6129,nice to see they were shot with a camara... and not a rifle... just because they were an exceptional specimen.  Gerritt.

Here's a video film ""supposly at the groundhog river bridge""  Quote:  LOOK A White Moose !! This is a white albino moose I filmed near Timmins Ontario Canada. This is the only white moose I've ever seen! CHECK IT OUT!! there is also a brown moose beside it.  http://www.metacafe.com/watch/376286/look_a_white_moose/   @Pam,  Maybe you know the whole story about those moose around out place"
42468,Northhunter,2007-03-03 04:50:00,214,They aren't albino's. They are regular moose with a recessive gene.  Now you know
