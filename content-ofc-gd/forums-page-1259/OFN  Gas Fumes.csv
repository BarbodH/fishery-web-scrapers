42503,dsn,2007-03-03 11:26:00,1018,  Thanks for the insight. Sure sheds some light into misjudging the situations. I guess this is one part of our resources that we are running out. Along with some other unknowns ahead.  dsn
42537,Carp,2007-03-03 13:39:00,1488,I think we should start fishing closer to home. Don't want to take off on a long drive if there won't be any gas to get back.
42541,Guest Trophymuskie,2007-03-03 13:43:00,0,"The thief's will never built another refinery or increase storage as that's their excuses for ripping us off. You guys already forgot last year when we were getting ripped 1.35 a liter for absolutely no reason whatsoever? How about seeing the price go up 10 cents every long weekend?  It's a scam plain and simple, look at the record profits the oil companies are making. It's about time to government shuts the doors down on all incoming oil and sets regulations. Yes we can buy small cars but gas is a necessity just like food is. No gas means no work, no food for most of us.  And I own a big truck because it is needed for both of my businesses, no big truck = no work for me.  And how come when you here on the radio that oil is going up on the market it takes but minutes before you see prices go up at the pumps but when the price goes down it takes days to make it to the pumps?? It's just like out great government you have to pay them now but if they owe you well you have to wait."
42547,aplumma,2007-03-03 13:55:00,6896,"Would it help if we actually called it demand and supply. We demand more fuel (gas and diesel) than they can supply. The US has not built any new refineries in the last 17 years and we are using fuel faster than they can refine it. Between the  ""we don't want it in our back yards"" people and the cost of building the refineries not to mention the epa guidlines we are in trouble. Sure their is lots of profits now for the gas companies because they don't have the expense of building the refineries yet however when  the goverment is not sitting in the gas companies corner then some things are going to change IF the public demands it. This is the same thing as tobacco when the public voice became to small (lack of smokers) the price went thru the ceiling. We all know what the answer is we all are just not ready to pay the price by using less gas by all methods including giving up our big motors and fishing in our back yard. I personally am not fed up enough to sell my truck and boats or give up driving up North to fish with my friends.   Art"
42555,dsn,2007-03-03 14:25:00,1018,"Hey trophymuskie, I just thought about something. You mentioned last years $1.35+ gas prices. Its true we had those pices back then. And nothing such at a refinery went up in flames. You would figure a lost refinery would make prices soar up to those prices but it didn't . ???  Does make me wonder why the prices where so high then, and nothing such as a lost refinery caused them. With a lost refinery the prices are under $1.35. Shouldn't it be the other way? If we lose a refinery the prices should be $1.35+ mean while its lower than that now. I'm not saying that it should be up but just a thought.  Cause it does make sense if the prices where $1.35+ and we lost a refinery. Not when we haven't lost anything and the prices were $1.35.   Everything is ass backwards  (as they say at my work place."
42611,topraider,2007-03-03 16:20:00,30,"There is a conspiracy all right, but its not what some of you might think..  The oil company conspiracy is - Keep gas prices in Southern Ontario and the GTA low!  The oil companies know that raising the prices to where they need to be right now would cause a political firestorm, even though a $1 a litre is what many Canadians from other parts of the country paid before any fire. From afar, Ontarians might appear to be a bunch of whiners.  If the price was raises to $1.25 a litre, people would use less, and  new supplies would come in from our neighbors, so no shortages would exist.  The choice is, cheap gas or shortages.  Ontario only refines about 2/3 of the gas it uses. Refineries are dirty and make big messes. Maybe that's Ontario's way of exporting our pollution. We need more refineries, how about a big one in Dan McTeagues riding of Pickering, that way he doesn't have to go as far to do his price gouging investigations."
42724,Joey,2007-03-03 22:05:00,9122,Just saw this in the Toronto Sun today.  Wonder if it will work.  boycott gas  Joey
42749,irishfield,2007-03-03 22:46:00,26272,No Joey...it will cause exactly what is going on right now. Cut one guy off...everyone buys somewhere else and then their scheduled fuel delivery truck arrives a day tooo late.... station runs out...panic buys start..same sheeet that's going on now.
42750,Corey,2007-03-03 22:48:00,355,"Ya know... nobody seems to quite understand what is the root cause of this fuel shortage. In truth the shortage is the direct result of CN Rail. Because of the strike by the CN conductors, they cannot get enough fuel into Ontario by rail. People keep talking about refineries, but this has very little to do with our fuel shortage. Believe me, the refineries in Ontario hardly produce enough fuel for Ontario's use. The majority of our fuel is brought in on rail cars, as well as the unrefined fuel used by the refineries.  If people want a company to complain to about this, call CN and ask why they can't work out a descent agreement with their unions, ask why they make it impossible for trucking companies to get in and out of their depots.  The fuel supply shortage started happening when the CN conductors went on strike, it just took until this last week for gas stations to start running dry. Anyone who drives a truck hauling sea containers in and out of the Brampton CN yard will know what I am talking about. For the record, I don't drive a truck, nor do I have anything to do with it or with CN. I just know a lot of people in a lot of industries.  cd."
41985,bigfish1965,2007-03-02 05:05:00,3382,"SO if it is so expensive, why y'all still driving big trucks? Don't buy it..plain and simple. It isn't a scam, it is supply and  demand. Everyone got stupid and panic bought and  the price went up. If everyone went out and bought ten heads of lettuce today, what would be the price of lettuce tomorrow? Gasoline and lettuce onlycost what someone is willing to pay. If you want someone to blame, have a look in the mirror. YOU SET THE GAS PRICES. The supply will come back. And we ship most of it out cause we drill and refine more than we can use. But if you ship it here from Alberta, how much would it cost then? You guys are funny sometimes. There are towns up north that only have Esso stations and since they have no alternative, they must buy from Esso. Esso must, in turn, take gas from around here and send it there."
42036,aplumma,2007-03-02 12:34:00,6896,"It does all boil down to the economics of supply and demand. Look at the price of gas at the marina it is alot more than at the gas station even though(here in the states) the 28% road tax is not applied. That means if the price was the same as the gas at the stations their is a 28% built in profit plus the 50 to 75 cents a gallon added on. Yea I know their is more insurance and special handling and containment but it does not cost that much more. It is just a matter their is less places to buy gas or you can haul it to the boat but that is a pain in the butt. As long as the pack mentality is to get gas now and get as much as you can then we make it scarce. The answer is to use the gas as you need to and fill up when you need to and the pressure will lessen and so will the price. If you like to drive the big truck and the boat that sucks gas then you need to see that you have an expense that other chose not to have. It's like smoking or drinking  no one has to do it however it is something we enjoy so we do do it. I am guilty of having a big truck and a boat and now a really big boat however I have decided that I will be able to afford to buy the gas to play with these toys that I enjoy. So make the choice either get a smaller car, consolidate trips, stop using the boat or car pool we all have options that we chose to exercise or not.   Art"
42037,huey graphite,2007-03-02 12:37:00,362,No conspiracy.....just supply and demand and the demand is high.
42054,crusty,2007-03-02 13:38:00,83,"You would all be happy to know while watching my RRSP's dwindle in real time yesterday, The banner on the bottom of the screen read ""TORONTO REFINERY NOW PRODUCING AT 50%"". This fiasco should not last much longer!  On another note, while in Mexico last week our tour guide for the day pointed out that all the gas stations were the exact same company. Mexicans buy gas off government run gas bars. In fact, they do not even post the price you are paying! He said there price was around $2.80 a gallon.  Could you emagine the buying power of all of canada, or all of the US, if we took on the Sieks as one mabye they would bargain more fairly!  Wasn't ESSO or PETRO owned by the government just a few years ago, ""the free market sytem will encourage lower prices for the consumer"" MY ASS"
42142,fishindevil,2007-03-02 16:57:00,6254,the big oil companies are all in bed together and are all crooks plain and simple....its a very complicated issue with no resolve in sight   i curse them everyday
42192,Puckhead,2007-03-02 19:16:00,377, Exactly
42224,Blake,2007-03-02 20:46:00,418,Supply and demand.  We need the supply and they demand payment.  Hopefully it won't be like the road warrior movies any time soon.
42351,holdfast,2007-03-03 00:30:00,1813,"Bull Bull and more of it.  Ontario gas prices are bouncing like a yo, yo, in the last 2 years. Totally out of Control.  Dont tell me there is not greed, Lack of Control, and purposely using any excuse to raise prices.  Only recently, long weeknds, storms, (a fire) has bounced prices beyond any reason.  The supply and demand theory is lame. Government must control this, but they are afraid.  Lets hear more excuses.  You really believe this is all legit.  Remember the ice storm, some companys, including Canadian Tires in Quebec Upped their Naptha prices spongeing on a dire situation for their own pockets. You dont think the oil companys to the gas station manager will sell theyre mother to fill their pockets.  Here in the oil Patch, Cops, Politicians, you name it, leave the companys alone.  They reek of money and power.  Biggest blizzard in Sk for this generation did not stop the ploughs from cleaning oil leases and roads getting to them."
42365,GbayGiant,2007-03-03 00:55:00,1780,"I agree it's supply and demand that's obvious, but I look at them the same as crack dealers except the gas companies make a slightly larger profit.  And yes I will be getting my gas fix as usual."
42375,Roy,2007-03-03 01:25:00,13728,We had a Shell refinery close down here recently. They're using that as the reason for  tight supplies. Yeah....right...I like my Jeep and my cars but I could still manage quite well without them. Shut'em down...Let's see who lasts the longest.
42501,Deano,2007-03-03 10:12:00,767,"As I syayed in the other post last week, I drove a fuel tanker for the last year and a half. We were running low many times and had to travel to whatever load rack that had fuel to fill our trucks, we ran low all summer long and was always trying to catch up. You would be surprised the amount of fuel which is being used at even some of the smaller gas stations. One small town station I delivered to had about 6 days where they went through 50000 litres in a day. That's almost one tanker full, and this is in a small town. I did some calculating and we were (around the clock, 4 drivers, 7 days) delivering 2,000,000 litres to the sudbury area, and that was only forone company. There is no consriracy, the demand is so huge, no new refineries have been built, and as I stated before, it's gonna get worse before it gets better."
