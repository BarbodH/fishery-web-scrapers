41792,FishFinder,2007-03-01 22:16:00,481,"Well we set off this morning at 5am despite the storm that was on the way. After arriving to our spot there was no one in sight, which is really rare considering the place we were fishing ( the photoshopped backgrounds must be working  ). We missed a few because of slush and ice but heres the ones we managed to hook and land.. Mine   Wishin I Was Wishin's bow..  Had a Nasty Lamprey Scar to it...   And my first OFC tournament entry, 27"" great lakes trout.    The drive back was terrblie, taking almost 3 hours, atleast 4 cars in the ditch within the first 20 minutes of snow starting to fall !! "
