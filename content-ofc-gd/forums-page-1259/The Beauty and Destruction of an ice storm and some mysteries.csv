42421,fishindevil,2007-03-03 02:51:00,6254,"very interesting pics,oh and those dino saur eggs are small ice chunks that have been worn away bashing on the rocks and worn smooth just like the rocks on the shoreline.....cheers"
42425,urbanangler1990,2007-03-03 03:04:00,933,amazing pics!!! looks outta this world! hell feezing over maybe? LOL
42505,dsn,2007-03-03 11:31:00,1018, Ah so thats how they got there huh. Interesting. I was wondering why they look so smooth and round. Hard to picture that they were huge ice chunks before. But it does make sense.  Thanks dsn
42522,Rich Clemens,2007-03-03 13:08:00,3131,"Very cool shots.  Ice Storms can be beautiful for pics, but even more so destructive.  Those are amazing pics."
42531,ccmtcanada,2007-03-03 13:27:00,7971,"Here's a few from my way...not after this last ice storm, this is from previous storms, the cold weather and spray from Lake Ontario...awesome sights.  Nature can have beauty...even in it's destruction.      "
42552,dsn,2007-03-03 14:13:00,1018,ccmtcanada I have seen alot of shoreline ones but found that the sand turns the  m all brown. Yuck!!
42561,Dano,2007-03-03 14:41:00,719,Cool pics guys. Ice can be created in some real interesting forms. Thanks.
