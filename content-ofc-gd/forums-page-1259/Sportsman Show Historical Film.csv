42383,Kawartha Kev,2007-03-03 01:33:00,281,With the upcoming Toronto Sportsmens Show I thought I would check out the website to see what they had planned to see if it was worth going to this year. On the site they had some old footage from the  1954 Sportsmens Show I thought some people might be interested in and might remember not that I am old enough for it but there might be some on oldtimers around here that might enjoy it.  Unfortunately the quality is not great and neither is my computer as it doesn't seem to play well for me anyway hope you enjoy it.  Here is the link just look for the 1954 Vintage footage http://www.sportsmensshows.com/Toronto/events.htm  Enjoy Kawartha Kev
