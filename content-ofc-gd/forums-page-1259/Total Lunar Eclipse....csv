42444,Kawartha Kev,2007-03-03 03:47:00,281,Hope the sky is clear should be interesting heres another link to the upcoming lunar eclipse  http://www.spaceweather.com/  Kawartha Kev
42447,douG,2007-03-03 03:53:00,2693,"Take a look to the east  late tomorrow afternoon, around 4:30 or so.  A much better show for Roy and those on the least coast"
42489,ehg,2007-03-03 06:25:00,2666,"This will be a daylight event, coloring the moon copperish. The only March full moon is called 'Full Worm Moon'.  ehg"
42526,Rich Clemens,2007-03-03 13:15:00,3131,"It looks like I'm in for a cloudy day.  Unfortunately, those of us in the states won't get the 'big show', just an over-shadowing / colorized moon.  Shucks !"
42690,ehg,2007-03-03 20:43:00,2666,This moon thing should be happening over next couple of hours if you can see through clouds.  ehg
42695,danc,2007-03-03 20:59:00,4677,"Nice and clear here today. I'll be out with the camera starting at 6:40 tonight, attempting to photograph the moon over Lake Superior. Wish me luck.."
42701,lew,2007-03-03 21:07:00,12767," I've been waiting to see this eclipse Dan, but it doesn't look like it's gonna happen as we've got a very cloudy day down here, so your pics may be the only chance we get....make em good"
42703,Roy,2007-03-03 21:19:00,13728,"Good luck to you Dan, and as Lew said, it's going to be way too cloudy here too. But then, with YOU taking the pics, there's not much sense in anyone else trying.  :-)"
42705,danc,2007-03-03 21:25:00,4677,  LOL Roy. Actually the moon is very difficult to photograph. The high contrast between the moon itself and the black background make for a difficult shoot. But it will still be somewhat light here when the eclipse takes place. And I don't expect the moon to be as bright as it normally is when it is lit up by the sun. So I'm being optimistic here. The entire event only lasts 20 minutes. I'll be off in an hour or so.
42717,Rich Clemens,2007-03-03 21:52:00,3131,Good Luck DanC.  Post a few pics if you get them.  We're socked in here in southern PA with snow flurries.  Won't be able to see a darn thing.
42725,pameladallaire,2007-03-03 22:07:00,470,"My brother is an astro-photographer, his reason for living!  I'll phone him tonight and ask if the skies were clear in Ottawa.  Pam"
42759,Whopper,2007-03-03 23:11:00,2174,"Got that right Dan I've been working on a good shot the last two full moons, haven't gotten it right yet. Good Luck and looking forward to your pics.  Whopper"
42777,urbanangler1990,2007-03-03 23:56:00,933,"this sux, im gonna miss it to0, cus of clouds!! boooo, good luck dan! show us what we missed lol"
42780,ccmtcanada,2007-03-03 23:59:00,7971,"I'm not a photographer by any stretch of the imagination, but I attempted to take pics of a lunar eclipse back in Nov 2003.  I used a cheap Kodak 3.1 megapixel camera...played around with the exposure settings and came up with a few shots.      Not the best shots, but without having telephoto lenses, and using the digial zoom by accident, this was the best I could do...LOL.  I know that Dan will post some AMAZING shots later, but for those of you in cloudy areas, this will have to tie you over til then. haha"
