42427,BFSC Kevin,2007-03-03 03:06:00,1351,"hey boss, think it is possible that you scan the flyer? i can't seem to find it.  I have a curado.. don't seem to know how to use it right.. every 5 or so casts there's a big birdnest.."
42455,Hooked,2007-03-03 04:08:00,891,Anyone know how I can get this flyer delivered?  Or is it only delivered to Vaughn and surrounding area?
42460,setomonkey,2007-03-03 04:18:00,872,I think this the link for the spring circular at the BPS on Hwy 400:  BPS Spring Circular  Mike
42462,Weeds,2007-03-03 04:26:00,782,"That link is for the ""Cabin Fever"" sale; ending march 4th. The Spring sale Bucktail is talking about must be for something different about to start. Funny, was just at Bass Pro today and bought my Abu C3, didn't realize other deals were about to start."
42519,mattyk,2007-03-03 13:03:00,2110,Shimano U.S. pulled out of the reel trade in progam this year south of the border. I was mad I was planning on getting a nice discount with the real trade in program but it was a no go. What can you do.
42605,Blake,2007-03-03 16:05:00,418,Buy a Curado they are AWESOME!!!  I have 2 of the 7:0:1 and they were great last year.   Kevin PM me and we can chat I will help you set yours up for ya.  The new Curado300 for you musky guys is also a fantastic reel.
