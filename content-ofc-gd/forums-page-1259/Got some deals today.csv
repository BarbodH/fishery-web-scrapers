They still have lots o plastics left, which is primarily what I got, along with some Owner treble hooks, #2 n #4, and some slip bobbers.  They still had some steelhead rods left, Gloomis, and baitcast rods, and next to no spinning reels or crankbaits.  So if you need some plastics, fishing line, or a steelhead rod, its worth checking.  Never checked the hunting stuff out either."
42210,Spiel,2007-03-02 19:54:00,9065,....Thanks for the heads up Ted. Care to lend me some money?
42230,xrap,2007-03-02 20:52:00,683,Where is head pro gear?
42237,Hooked,2007-03-02 21:07:00,891,"  Haha, now thats a good one Chris.       And xrap, ProGear is located on Upper Ottawa past Stone Church.  Think you thought heard was apart of the name, but its something I heard."
42239,Gerritt,2007-03-02 21:08:00,6129,"I figured they would go outta business...AGAIN!.... their customer service was garbage... I think this is the third time he has gone bankrupt.... Funny yanno... keep doing the same thing over n over and expect the result to change, not likely going to happen   Perhaps he NEEDS to stay out of business now..  Good riddance ProGear.  Gerritt."
42243,xrap,2007-03-02 21:11:00,683,"thanks, and do you know what time there open to?"
42245,Hooked,2007-03-02 21:16:00,891,"No, your gonna have to give em a call for that."
42249,Mike Pike,2007-03-02 21:17:00,1332,"Thanks for that Hooked.  A bit out of my way but I may drop by.  It's a shame when a tackle store closes but, honestly, I thought they had closed a long time ago.  They never really promoted themselves and being tucked away up there on the east mountain, I think most of us had forgotten about them."
