This morning, I drove 2 m way from a downed hydro pole, plow went beside it, I figured it would be ok, down the road found out it was 'live'. (better not do that next time, just incase)   Also, gave a farmer a ride to his house, had got his plow truck stuck twice, and his tractor was stuck in another driveway. Was walking to get 'the big one'.   Lost power last night, wife is at home keeping warm with the wood stove.   Not many people at work, I should have stayed home too. Roads weren't that bad though.   You making out ok?   Entropy"
