41861,Crazyhook,2007-03-02 00:25:00,1154,"brinnging a spinning rod for smaller fish and bait catching, my abu 7000 in case something big is around and my 8 weight fly rod to try for bonefish. Got my gotcha's, crazy charlie's, crab flies and a few others. For Cudas macks and Jacks I brought a bunch of Xraps, zara spooks, skitter walks, yo zuri's, rapalas. As well as a few bags of gulp! small jigs, hair jigs and a bulldawg! ( because I can!)  any other suggestions for fishing Cuba ( Cayo coco)"
41879,setomonkey,2007-03-02 01:01:00,872,"No ideas, Jamie, but I'll bet you have a good time!  Post a report when you get back...  Mike"
41884,GbayGiant,2007-03-02 01:17:00,1780,"Good luck Jamie. I've always wondered what a musky tackle box would produce down south ? Bulldawgs ? Why not, I would like to try some huge spinner baits south, they seem to work on everything else."
41954,Crazyhook,2007-03-02 03:12:00,1154,"I brought a bunch to florida last time... no luck  got the comment "" Ya fishing for Marlin"" a few times though"
41957,Joey,2007-03-02 03:18:00,9122,"Do you have your Ontario Fishing Community.com paper and a tape measure     Oops, guess the fish you'll be catching down there won't qualify  Have fun Jamie.  Take LOTS of pics.  Joey"
41987,charlied,2007-03-02 05:09:00,584,go to the kitchens and ask for shrimp....and just put on hook....thats what they were getting Baricuda on at Krystal Laguna in Cayo coco...getting them in the lagoon
41988,sirfish,2007-03-02 05:19:00,175,There are other lagoons to try on Cayo Coco . The Melia at the south end has a lake area that is teeming with what look like bass also on the south of the Krystal is an area on the ocean like a rock pile that has an awesome view try letting a line out there saw lots of fish there while snorkelling one was a huge cuda. Saw the boats come in with some huge Mahi Mahi also. have fun get lots of pics.
42063,Crazyhook,2007-03-02 13:50:00,1154,thanks everyone!  Question I have an 8 foot rod case? would I be able to bring that on the plane?? have a good 8 foot rod that would be perfect and in the same case I can fit a small spinning rod and my fly rod can fit in my carry on...

42070,huntervasili,2007-03-02 13:59:00,1604,I have brought my one piece rod on the plane in a tube... I dont think it could be a carryon bot you could probably chech it as a piece of your luggage
42085,Guest gbfisher,2007-03-02 14:20:00,0,Ony one comment  NIGHT FISHING OFF BRIDGES!  you have PM
42101,Crazyhook,2007-03-02 14:49:00,1154,"  I can  hand them as offerings to the locals! better not, they may think I can walk on water after tasting a vanilla filled for the first time"
42135,1leggedangler,2007-03-02 16:28:00,364,Have a great time and hope the weather is awesome for you.
42136,lew,2007-03-02 16:41:00,12767,"I spose this means our trip to Ashbridges tomorrow night is cancelled , eh Jamie ??"
42182,Crazyhook,2007-03-02 18:23:00,1154,Yes Sir!   tradiign in the big smog for the big tarpon! hope you understand
42223,Smokey,2007-03-02 20:45:00,1278,Have a great trip Jamie. Make sure you bring us back some pics and stories to go along with them.  Mike
42402,keith,2007-03-03 02:02:00,15,jamie-just to be on safe side> if you check in a rod holder  tube make sure you  stick an ID  sticker on  side of tube/the regular string one sometimes get torn off. also good idea to put a sticker with the flt no and hotel   name /address in cuba on side/ also good idea  put ID tags on 2 different places on bags in case handle breaks along with baggage tag  . (if you have ID on bags they can always match  your name  and flt no..) Have a good flt!
42535,Guidofisherman,2007-03-03 13:33:00,206,"I stayed at the Krystal resort. See the Sunquest desk and ask for fishing with Orlando. He will take you to a tidal channel for a variety of fish. That is the best spot. Bring some extral tackle to leave as they can't get much there. If fishing on your own, try the rocky point to the right. I saw lots of grunts and cuda.  "
42545,Eddyk,2007-03-03 13:54:00,195,Jamie. Do you have to buy a special license to fish in Cuba ?
42551,Crazyhook,2007-03-03 14:11:00,1154,"no license required... thanks everyobne for the tips, can't wait to reel my reel sing!"
42553,Bly,2007-03-03 14:16:00,1556,Just wanted to wish you safe travels and good fishing!   Looking forward to your report and pictures!   bly
42564,Chris,2007-03-03 14:47:00,405,Have a great time man and bring back lots of pics please
42570,lew,2007-03-03 15:06:00,12767," Don't worry about it Jamie, we'll make up for it on the Ottawa this summer"
42580,Crazyhook,2007-03-03 15:26:00,1154,I will have pics for sure.... I have read that there are some sharks just past the reef. Can't wait to see the locals face when I put a hook into the back of a cuda and send it out  :)
