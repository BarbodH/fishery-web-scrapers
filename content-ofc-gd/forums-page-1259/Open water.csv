42474,Castmaster,2007-03-03 05:13:00,86,The Detroit river is all open water. My local ramp at the upper mouth of the river is also wide open as of today. St. Clair is still pretty frozen but I 'm taking the boat out Sunday to pull some wire for some early spring eye's.  Last year this time I landed a 9 1/2lb walleye as my first fish of the year. I'am so darn excited!!! Could it be Sunday right now please?
42485,GbayGiant,2007-03-03 06:12:00,1780,"That's awesome having open water already, good luck.  Just a question, don't they have a closed period to give the fish some time to spawn ? It just closed here the other day untill May."

42494,charlied,2007-03-03 07:13:00,584,you can always venture down to the Niagara river...she is open...LOL
42539,ccmtcanada,2007-03-03 13:40:00,7971,"Just checked the regs... Detroit river is in zone 1 (according to the exception list for the area), so Walleye are open all year in that area.  Lucky you!!!  Go Get EM!!!!"
42626,Castmaster,2007-03-03 17:11:00,86,Detroit river and Lake St. Clair open all year.
42652,GbayGiant,2007-03-03 18:53:00,1780,Not fair......lol.. If you look at a lot of record fish they were caught full of spawn very early in the year but most places in Canada have closed periods during those times. The walleye spawn right beside my place and I see some monsters in there but they shrink a lot after the spawn.  I'm jealous that's all.
