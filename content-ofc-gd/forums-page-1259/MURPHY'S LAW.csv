Left to themselves, things will only go from bad to worse.  If there’s a possibility of several things going wrong, the one that eventually go wrong is the one that will do the most damage possible.  Mother nature ALWAYS sides with the hidden flaw.  Mother Nature is also the worst birch imaginable!  If everything appears to be going very well, you have obviously overlooked something!  D  A  F  F  Y  N  I  T  I  O  N  S   A  R  C  H  I  T  E  C  T  S   Architects are people who know a great deal about very little, and who go along knowing more & more about less and less, until they reach a point where they know practically nothing about everything. E  N  G  I  N  E  E  R  S   Engineers, on the other hand are people who know very little about a great deal. They keep learning more and more about less and less until the reach a point where they know practically nothing about just about everything.  C  O  N  T  R  A  C  T  O  R  S   Contractors start out knowing practically everything about everything, but end up knowing nothing about anything, due to having to associate with architects and engineers far to much!"
