I went out about an hour before the eclipse was supposed to start and took a bunch of photos while the sun was setting. I got some nice shots then. When the moon finally appeared, my camera wouldn't function properly. I couldn't make any manual adjustments. I was forced to use settings that I wasn't comfortable with. I guess that it was exposed to the cold for too long. It was darn cold here with the wind chill.  I might have a couple of decent shots. I'll do some post processing in the morning and post my results."
42872,Handlebarz,2007-03-04 04:19:00,3790,I could have had some nice shots of the snow but no moon here if it had been last night we had clear skies and saw a nice almost full moon then.
