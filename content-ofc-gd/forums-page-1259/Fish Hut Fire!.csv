Back to pick him up in  a couple hours and was greeted by Parking lot full of emergency vehicles. Turns out a hut further out (east ) in the bay had caught fire , and Matthew was the one who placed the 911 call!  Hope no one was hurt  TB"

42361,misfish,2007-03-03 00:49:00,29133," L M A O   Im guessing a sunk in hut and no way to get it out,or some vandals.Happens every year."
42368,Ron,2007-03-03 01:12:00,1683,You will be seeeing this more and more as the season comes to an end where huts have to be removed. Last year out on the whities grounds there must have been at least 3 huts up in smoke. Some people are just too dang lazy to maintain them from freezing in the ice and the only way as far as their concerned is to put em up in flames. No concern for anyone. Tis a shame.
42371,motv8tr,2007-03-03 01:15:00,2587,I too hope no one was hurt...way to go Mathew...  Maureen

42573,Headhunter,2007-03-03 15:11:00,5703,Perhaps they just couldn't wait to get their limit of Whities smoked! They were hungry and a little pro-active with the smoker! HH
