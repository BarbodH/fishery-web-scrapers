42583,nelly,2007-03-03 15:28:00,256,Reading Cliff thread on last year walleye season got me depress (LOL). Congrats to all you walleye fisherman and lady on landing some nice eyes. Last year was my worst year for walleye. Tough and only afew. No trophy but did manage a couple for the dinner table. Went with Plan B-back to basic. Took up panfishing and did alot of searching for crappie. Bingo as I was able to locate a school of them during the spring.  Enought of me rambling on. Surfing on the net I came along this neat video. Look at the background for the musky or pike near the 1:55 mark.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQlZ2lLjtm8
42588,ccmtcanada,2007-03-03 15:32:00,7971,Very cool video!  Thanks for posting it.  Some pretty big ones there from what could tell.  Sorry to depress you!! LOL.  The pics ppl have posted there were VERY impressive...this video just adds to the anticipation for the season opener.

42609,dsn,2007-03-03 16:13:00,1018,now I see why they are so hard to catch for me that is. They seem to like small bottom out indents in the sand or bottom as holding spots.  dsn

42680,nelly,2007-03-03 20:25:00,256,Could it be the Scugog River between Port Perry and Lindsay? (LOL) Maybe that is why the walleye fishing is tough on Scugog Lake. They are hiding in the river at the end of the lake and not the town. Don't forget about that musky? who is also feeding on walleye.
