41966,Blake,2007-03-02 03:48:00,418,"March 2 is a year that my mom passed away.  Many of you know how close I was to her and this week has been a very emotional week filled with tears. Friday the 2nd is going to be very hard for myself and family.  If you could just give a quick thought to a great lady, best friend, Nan, wife and mother.  She is sadly missed and treasured by all of us.      Thanks Blake"
