We just didn't know we were getting low . The reason for that is purely geographical.  Our OIL is located in Alberta, Newfoundland Saskatchewan and  B.C.  Our DIPSTICKS are located in OTTAWA , ONTARIO"

42528,Rich Clemens,2007-03-03 13:20:00,3131,There's always a reason ... many of which I just don't understand.
42543,Carp,2007-03-03 13:45:00,1488," Having so much oil in this country, we should be paying a lot less for gas. Just greed. Pure and simple.  When we start using alternate fuel sources, I guarantee the price of gas will come down. I heard the big oil giants keep buying the rights to new and alternate fuel technology so we have no choice but to keep buying their oil products. Smart business move, even if we don't like it much."
42645,jeffw,2007-03-03 18:28:00,267,I work for petrocanada and I can tell you there is definately no gas shortage. The reason we pay so much for gas is because alot of our crude oil is sold to the states where they refine it and sell it back to us at an inflated price. And as everyone knows more than half the price of gas is tax. Cheers Jeff

42737,Daplumma,2007-03-03 22:28:00,1961,I f y'all would construct some refineries you would be up to your ears in cheap gas.For that matter the US should build some more and drill in Alaska and we not be worried about the middle east. Joe
