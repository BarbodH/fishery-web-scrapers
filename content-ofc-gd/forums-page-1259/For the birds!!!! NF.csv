The birds came from every direction!! Landing in their hands, in the seed bucket...and one even perched itself on bly's hat.  Here's a short video of their visit..... <BR><BR>  <object width=""320"" height=""240""><param name=""movie"" value=""  "

41781,Garyv,2007-03-01 21:50:00,547,I really enjoyed that.  We have many bird houses and in winter a couple of feeders in the birch tree by one of the front windows.  The wife and I sit and watch the birds almost every morning.  I use watching them for serenity before facing the normal day.
