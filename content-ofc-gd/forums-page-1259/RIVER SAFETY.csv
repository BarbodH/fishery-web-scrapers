42391,Gerritt,2007-03-03 01:48:00,6129,am I the only one not shouting?  Gerritt.
42392,GNODDY,2007-03-03 01:48:00,163,Not true Clampet I went down after work today to take a quick look for the morning Lol. But CC is right watch yourself the rivers are fast and can creep up on you. I must say though there isnt as much Ice as I thought there was on the rivers
42399,GNODDY,2007-03-03 01:59:00,163,haha Your funny man I love some of the stuff you put down on this
42401,huntervasili,2007-03-03 02:01:00,1604,Common Sense is really important out there no matter how Experienced you may be... Fast flowing water doesn't distinguish between seasoned anglers and beginners... I know when I go out I keep an eye on water levels especially near dams and during melts...
42412,Frankypro,2007-03-03 02:35:00,63,  Perhaps the differnce between having stories told about you or you being around to tell fishing stories yourself.   GOOD TOPIC CANADIAN_COPPER!  Clampet    I don't know of any icon that says nervously funny.  Oh sorry Gerritt  shhhhh.
42441,Bly,2007-03-03 03:39:00,1556,"  Good Topic!  With the warm weather and the rain, Ccmt and I decided to check out some local tribs.  The ones in our area were completely blown with high, fast moving water.  Saw large chunks of ice, and an approx. 100 ft long dock floating in from Lake Ontario.  The sheer power of the current being displayed was amazing......definitely nothing to play around with!   Play safe Bly"
