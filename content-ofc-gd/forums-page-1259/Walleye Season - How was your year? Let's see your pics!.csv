42478,hogsmally,2007-03-03 05:21:00,21,"Caught several nice fish this year.  These are on another great lake (not Quinte).  They were caught within 10 minutes of each other in 5 feet of water casting cranks.  The big fish is over 12 pounds, the other one isn't far behind.    "
42509,DT10Sam,2007-03-03 12:01:00,480,"Well the hard water season was great this year even though it was a short season. Here is a pic of our employee Glen Hales with a male walleye.    A pic of Glen with Dan. The walleye that Glen caught was a 12 lber and it was released.    Dan with his personal best 13 1/2 lber.    Hope you enjoy these and we are all just waiting for the soft water season.  Regards, Sam"

42622,The Urban Fisherman,2007-03-03 16:56:00,2050,"My only two Eyes of 2006 and I caught them on a sunday afternoon fishing with my then pregnant Girlfriend and two dogs down @ the CREDIT RIVER, in Port Credit......I was just as shocked as the rest of you!  Sorry the pix aren't better - at the time I only had the camera on my cell phone because I wiped out a week or so earlier and ended up swimming in lake O, with the digi cam in my pocket.  This was the first one, a beauty @ 4lbs.   The pair, I caught them back to back - the smaller one was 3lbs   The fillets!   Dinner - in case you're wondering they were MMM MMMM gooood - and that glass on the upper left hand side isn't just ginger ale! mmmmm "
41683,ccmtcanada,2007-03-01 19:44:00,7971,"With all the awesome Walleye reports from the Bay of Quinte and Lake Ontario this year (on both soft and hard water), I was wondering how your season went?  For division 8 (Lake Ontario), the season ended yesterday.  Bly and I went out for one last shot at them last night...but we were skunked!  The water was very murky and the surface kept icing up a little, so we couldn't get our crankbaits down.  We weren't expecting to catch anything, just wanted to get out that last time.  Bly and I had an awesome year...fishing along the shore of Lake Ontario.  They were all caught with artificial bait...mostly crank baits, but a few with jigs and spoons.  Fishindevil took me out on his boat trolling for them back in November and we caught a few real nice ones.  Here's our PBs from last fall.  Blys PB was a 15 pounder, 31"" long and a whopping 20.5"" girth   My PB was this 14.5 pounder, 32"" long, 19"" girth   Here's my only Walleye that I caught during the day...LOL.  Caught on Fishindevil's new Lund!   Let's see your pics!  Cant wait til it's warm enough to fish comfortably again....come on spring!!!"
41706,irishfield,2007-03-01 20:05:00,26272,"Mine from BOQ this fall.  31.5"" fishing with Lloyd and Dano in a typhon  and the 28 I caught the next day with just me and Dano out in my boat "
41727,lew,2007-03-01 20:24:00,12767,"We only fish for pickeral for a couple weeks in May while were waiting for musky season to open, but it's not so much what we catch, but more, who you catch them with.  Always the best trip of the year for me....Quinte in May with the boyz          Won't be to much longer now !!"
41729,ccmtcanada,2007-03-01 20:26:00,7971,You got that right Lew...that's why I'm looking foward to Lakair this year!
41732,lew,2007-03-01 20:29:00,12767," Guaranteed your gonna luv the Lakair trip Cliff, thats my 2nd favorite of the year"
41752,SlowPoke,2007-03-01 20:55:00,2984,"Had some numbers this year, not many bigguns... 5.5lbs might be the best   "
41775,fishdawg,2007-03-01 21:40:00,912,"Hit Quinte a few times this past fall (& winter)  first trip in October I set a new PB 11.5lbs  went again in mid Nov, a fewnice ones, but nothing over 10....  but with the cancellation of an  early Jan. ice trip we went back & I upped my PB a few more ounces    does this photo look like it was taken on Jan 6?   I really enjoy Quinte - it treats me well"

If you get a chance to go out with him.Do it you will be more than happy. WE had 14 fish from 6 am to 12PM biggest being probably a 14-15lber got off at the net.        tightlines  Gnoddy
42030,ccmtcanada,2007-03-02 12:15:00,7971,"WOW!! Some awesome pictures here.  It's not all about size...as Lew said, but the experience that goes with it. Keep them coming...cant wait for soft water again!!"

42097,SHAD,2007-03-02 14:42:00,134,"We did pretty good last year.  Eye fishing started around July and went to December.  This year might target them a bit from the opener and see what we can do.  Here's a few pics.        Keep some    Release some    Longest of last year, my heaviest too  "
42206,Steve,2007-03-02 19:50:00,2075,"My boat faired ok last year for Walleye. I'll save you pics with my ugly mug, however, here's some guests holding some quality fish.              Nothing beats getting a long time walleye guy onto their first 12+ pound fish."
42213,Fishmaster,2007-03-02 20:10:00,920,Here are a couple cathes from Port Maitland Lake Erie this summer when i had a chance from chartering to get out with some friends ..   
42233,GbayGiant,2007-03-02 20:57:00,1780,"CCMT, this post is just an excuse to show of those little Wally's you and Bly get....lol jk  Here is my longest of the year caught directly under my dock in May on GBay, the pic does no justice but it was 32.5"" and freshly spawned out so it was a little slim.  Very nice fish by the way fellas.  "
42242,drufis,2007-03-02 21:10:00,45,First year seriously fishing since I used to do it with my dad when I was about 10.  My first Walleye pulled out of Rice Lake.   
42247,muskiebobsr,2007-03-02 21:17:00,49,Hey Gbay how many Muskie do you catch off that dock?  Looks like a place I would love to fish at.  Good Fishing All.  Bob
42259,GbayGiant,2007-03-02 21:36:00,1780,"I've only landed one musky off the dock 48-49"", but have seen quite a few and some bigger ones eat the walleye off my hook at the surface, they tend to be in there out of season up here so I don't try to catch them off the dock but they like jigs and minnows sometimes."
42260,ccmtcanada,2007-03-02 21:46:00,7971," LOL...from what I gather GbabyGiant, your fish was longer than mine and blys....haha.  Great lookin eye you had there!  All the pics in this thread make me wish it was soft water time NOW!!!!  Thanks to  everyone contributing pics!!"
42265,GbayGiant,2007-03-02 21:54:00,1780," Well, I pinched the tail for the extra 1/2 inch."
