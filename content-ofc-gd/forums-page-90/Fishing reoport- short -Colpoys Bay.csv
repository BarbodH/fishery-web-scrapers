1006205,Bill Shearer,2017-06-12 21:00:00,456,"Sounds like ""normal"" as the self policing goes.... Kind of like the inmates running the prison?"
1006220,moxie,2017-06-12 22:00:00,1566,  Edited to add; Sorry to hear your outing was uneventful. At least you got out on the water.Better luck next time.
1006454,CRUD150,2017-06-14 20:02:00,87,"Thank you. It was the best weather day of fishing we have had this year.  I hope for the sake of the sport fishing in the area, some efforts can be made to enforce some changes. Changes with respect owed  to the sport fishing clubs that work so hard to put fish back into the water."
1006471,Old Ironmaker,2017-06-14 21:39:00,8243,"Sorry to hear the no fish report. I hear you about the nets. We battle dodging commercial nets all summer here on Erie in the prime fishing spots. Watching them unload tons of sportsfish on the docks make me want to cry, and this is all legal. In 1 single net I see more incidental catches of very big Smallies and even Pike in the Walleye nets than I can catch and release in 5 years here. Some Bass would be my personal best. Just tragic.  Heading up there Sunday afternoon. Winds don't look great but I might as well bring the boat. Wind and weather reports change from day to day.  Better luck next time Crud. By the way what were you fishing for?"
