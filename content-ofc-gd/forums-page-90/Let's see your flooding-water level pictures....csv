1004522,ccmtcanada,2017-05-25 17:41:00,7971,I've seen a few threads here and there showing flooding or high water levels.  Thought it may be interesting to combine pics in one thread.  I saw the pics floatnfly posted about the Whitby pier...and I was blown away!  So let's see them!  What's the status of the water level in your area?

1004668,ccmtcanada,2017-05-26 17:29:00,7971,After the rains yesterday I took a drive down to the Whitby pier.....first ran into this on the way down on Brock Street....   Turned around and went the long way around and when I got there I was amazed at the water....it's usually 3 feet below the pier.      
1004669,AKRISONER,2017-05-26 17:30:00,5558,anyone have any photos out of the kawarthas?
1004671,OhioFisherman,2017-05-26 17:44:00,6623,Rain predicted here for 7 of the next 15 days! It's slowing down?
1004673,BassMan11,2017-05-26 17:53:00,583,Lake O is ridiculously high at the moment. Here are some picture of the Niagara-on-the-Lake Sailing club from a couple weeks ago. Believe it or not it's even worse now. Tonnes of damage to the buildings as well as the docks and boardwalk. The highest water ever recorded there.

Looks like a small school of carp in the bottom picture?
1004678,BassMan11,2017-05-26 18:15:00,583,That's correct. They are there everyday from what I hear. Also they have seen some small Pike sunning themselves as well in the parking lot.
1004691,ccmtcanada,2017-05-26 20:39:00,7971,Crazy crazy pictures!!!  Those carp in the parking lot is pretty amazing to see....
1004739,Sinker,2017-05-27 16:23:00,8692,"Yeah, lots of water. Oshawa and cobourg beaches are underwater. Bowmanville lakefront homes are totally flooded...its crazy.  The kawartha's are high, but not flooding.  S."
1004754,esoxansteel,2017-05-27 21:05:00,1307,"For the charter guys tying up to docks will be difficult to impossible, especially at Port Hope, gas pumps at Port of Newcastle under water,"
1004762,FloatnFly,2017-05-27 22:28:00,1640,a lot of lake o boat launches are closed as well

1005471,mikeh,2017-06-05 19:23:00,824,"THE Rouge Park at the end of Lawrence ave east , the water is at the bottom of the hill before you go down to the parking lot, this was 3-4 days ago."
1005590,Sinker,2017-06-06 14:46:00,8692,"Fished rice on sunday. Levels are back to normal spring level. Weeds are crazy high. I think they grew to the top of the high water, then they let all the water out, so now its crazy thick with weeds!!"
1005612,jimmer,2017-06-06 16:59:00,2730,This was my shoreline before the water dropped.  I usually have a 1 1/2 foot drop to the water. That is my boat launch which is usually clearly visible without the high water.  I have the wood on the dock strapped with bungie cords so it wouldn't float away.  Back down to normal conditions and the weeds are going to be ugly this year.. 
1005618,Dara,2017-06-06 17:53:00,3052,The way we are dumping water from Lake Superior its not going to get any lower downstream either But it ain't raining...sunny and hot for the next 2 weeks
1005627,mepps,2017-06-06 18:54:00,1301,"here are a few more!  Yesterday @ Stoco Lake, Tweed. There is usually a beach on the right side...   Humber Bay Park West, Etobicoke boat launch late May   Center Island, Toronto late May "
