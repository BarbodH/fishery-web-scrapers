Im still learning, but I enjoy this great fishing art. Fish were not big and I didn't care., Lots of walking and the right arm got a work out. Keep your dirty comments to yourselves. LOL      JR, If you see this, please PM me."
1006059,Terry,2017-06-11 19:29:00,14456,"nice, great little fishes there"
1006106,Joeytier,2017-06-12 01:48:00,3990,Awesome.   I'd  rather do that with light gear than rub shoulders for steelhead.
1006118,misfish,2017-06-12 10:03:00,29133,You got that right Joey.   Looks like a road trip for some bass fishing this weekend.
1006119,FLEX ROD,2017-06-12 10:17:00,394,Looks like you had fun Brian.  Thanks for sharing.  FLEX - John
1006131,AKRISONER,2017-06-12 13:52:00,5558,nothing like the fight on the fly...love it
1006134,Tom S,2017-06-12 14:04:00,362,Looking good. Nothing like first cast first fish.
1006145,BillM,2017-06-12 14:29:00,17367,"Nice Brian!  If you're catching future steelhead, make sure you pinch the barbs"
1006150,cl_fishin,2017-06-12 15:14:00,138,"Nice,..I too enjoy small stream trouting, look like you had a fun day"
1006163,misfish,2017-06-12 16:03:00,29133,"Thanks guys  Ya Bill, I thought of that, but didn't have a pair of pliers, but if I did, they might get off. LOL J/K. I also think I should of stepped up from a #12 to maybe a #10 to get bigger fish? Like I said, still learning. The last area I fished, I will be returning too. Seems I have this Friday off all of a sudden.  There is miles and miles to explore there. Never know what you'll find when you take a Sunday drive."
1006165,Rattletrap2,2017-06-12 16:37:00,1652,Fantastic outing! I would take those little trout over putting up with crowds to possibly get bigger ones too.
1006168,Tom S,2017-06-12 16:44:00,362,"Nice Brian!  If you're catching future steelhead, make sure you pinch the barbs  Pinch them anyhow before you hook yourself. Bound to happen eventually if you're fly casting."

Never know what you'll find when you take a Sunday drive.  a 12 to a 10 wont make a difference in the size of a fish, i've had those little guys take a #6 fly, and then perfect drift guide is getting 26"" fish on a #18 fly, all depends on whats in the pool, and how aggressive it wants to be  for little fish like that, should consider getting a little 2 or 3wt rod, they tend to be shorter (7ft range) instead of the 9ft, makes it easier for getting into those little streams"

I know theres lots of little places you can fish in your area Mr.B. Then again, that was 35 years ago. Probly swallowed up by development by know.    a 12 to a 10 wont make a difference in the size of a fish, i've had those little guys take a #6 fly, and then perfect drift guide is getting 26"" fish on a #18 fly, all depends on whats in the pool, and how aggressive it wants to be  for little fish like that, should consider getting a little 2 or 3wt rod, they tend to be shorter (7ft range) instead of the 9ft, makes it easier for getting into those little streams  I will look into that FF.

Those little drys and nymphs love to catch ears and necks, my worst was a size 1/0 Deceiver that caught just behind the webbing between my thumb and fingers. Sharp hooks mean they don't hurt going in, pinched barbs mean they don't hurt coming out."

I also have a large brim hat.  I was wearing it in my Saturday video. Just didn't wear it Sunday, as I only have a head mount for my go pro. I dont trust that bill clip I have.  Need to get a shoulder strap holder for it . I always have my shades on. I have enough troubles with my peeps. I do not need another issue to deal with.  Comes with the territory.

1006243,FloatnFly,2017-06-13 01:39:00,1640,"only been fly fishing for about 6 years, but have had the benefit of learning from some very experienced fly fishermen, been able to pick their brains so to say.  next step for you is fly tying, thats where the real fun and satisfaction begin, to land a fish that took something that you made."
