Both have very little experience so I figured a day of panfishing and maybe some decent game fish possibilities would be nice.  Balsam comes to mind as a good choice even though I've never fished it.  We just want to rent a basic tin boat.  I know Rosedale rents but their boats are pricey and more than what we need.  Any other renters on that lake that rent basic boats?   Any tips on fishing it would be great, too!  Thanks in advance.."

Balsam can get rough on the weekends with wind and large boat wakes. If you choose Pigeon, you can check out Buckeye right in Bobcaygeon in the canal."

1005733,Musky Plug,2017-06-07 16:30:00,398,There was a marina in Coboconk across the street from the Home Hardware that used to rent boats. Not sure if they still do or not. Work a try if you're set on going to balsam.
1005749,bigugli,2017-06-07 18:49:00,6138,A good alternative would be L Dalrymple. Roughly same distance and a lot fewer obstacles to navigate with good panfish. The resort on the west shore rents daily boats and were not pricey last time up

Would like to confirm before driving 1.5 hours.  I just hope these places are open on weekdays.  We are heading up tomorrow..
