1005456,CRAPPIE,2017-06-05 15:48:00,213,"I called Rogers already and they said ""contract done for this WFN channel"" . I am so lost now and I watched this channel everyday."
1005470,guastels,2017-06-05 18:53:00,22,I was told that Rogers and WFN could not come to an agreement during their renewal and Rogers decided not to carry it.
1005472,Mike Pike,2017-06-05 19:34:00,1332,"I have Cogeco in Hamilton( partially owned by Rogers )and still had WFN as of this morning.  I hope it stays.  I have it on nearly 24/7.  It's great, even if only for background."
1005477,GBW,2017-06-05 20:34:00,8460,"We all recall Shaw and rogers posting ads ""FX not available on Bell"" (is now) so maybe that's a new marketing plan for the Sat companies then to have new customers.  Duno but they had negative ads in the past so why not bring them back up (with WFN of course) to win some new tv customers."
1005483,dave524,2017-06-05 21:10:00,4508,Bell Fibe you have to get the BE$T package to get it or add it on as a $ingle Channel
1005484,GBW,2017-06-05 21:15:00,8460,Bell Fibe you have to get the BE$T package to get it or add it on as a $ingle Channel You can get ANY package and add it for $4.  Why pay for best when not needed?  You can add any channel to any package.  EG: Good + WFN = happy with rate and what you want.  Right?  Why pay for best when not needed for the 1 channel?

1005512,Old Ironmaker,2017-06-05 23:45:00,8243,"I miss the days of Red Fisher and Babe Winkleman. Now Red he was one crazy skilled angler and TV personality all in one. His favorite saying on the water was ""Pass me the Crown my friend"". I remember the one show he staggered into the camp fire. They must have not had enough bucks to pay someone to edit it out because there it was in full Black and White for all to see. Babe and his wife nearly came to blows one episode when he had one too many Old Milwaukie. She always had a spot at the end of the show demonstrating to all the ""ladies"" how to cook your man a great meal. She was frying Crappie and he said, ""that's perfect because you are a crappy cook"". I miss the days of TV when there was no such saying as politically correct."

1005312,John Bacon,2017-06-04 02:41:00,3277,The wold fishing network channel is gone and do U know why Rogers took this channel out?   I think the official answer was low viewership.
1005314,Woodsman,2017-06-04 03:35:00,1286, I think the official answer was low viewership. Bull Rogers doesn't care about viewership only profits generated.
1005315,GBW,2017-06-04 04:00:00,8460,Bull Rogers doesn't care about viewership only profits generated. true but I bet the free preview is over hence why they cannot set it now. If it was me I'd have done something very simple and gone to the WFN site to see what was up...  But that's real easy to do...
1005316,GBW,2017-06-04 04:01:00,8460,"Oh my, the site works!  http://www.worldfishingnetwork.com/"
1005317,lookinforwalleye,2017-06-04 04:28:00,4399,WFN was free for the month of May   Free is still too expensive for WFN.....
1005324,Fisherman,2017-06-04 12:17:00,7201,  Free is still too expensive for WFN..... 
1005325,Rizzo,2017-06-04 12:23:00,4754,I had it free for a month a short time ago and noticed The Musky Hunter was not part of the line-up anymore...that was disappointing
1005333,John Bacon,2017-06-04 14:42:00,3277,"Bull Rogers doesn't care about viewership only profits generated. True, but the two are related."
1005334,tizfun,2017-06-04 14:48:00,292,"Spoke to Rogers yesterday wondering why it was removed as I just looked over our bill... He said that they make changes to channel packages from time to time and WFN wasn't viewed as much as others...  I asked are they compensating anything of the channels missing from my Adventure Pkg I pay an additional 10.00/month for ??   Hope, nothing...    Welcome to Rogers....."
1005390,GBW,2017-06-04 21:09:00,8460,funny that a buddy   got a call from a person today and the caller changed over all his service's over to another company because of WFN.  So a $4 channel lost that company $200 a mth.  Makes for a great business case to drop it in my eyes...
1005402,davey buoy,2017-06-04 22:27:00,5505,"I gave it up watching a year ago,think it was a package my wife liked a part of. Don't miss it a bit"
1005404,bare foot wader,2017-06-04 22:46:00,1354,I think the explosion of youtubers and vimeo channels the past 3ish years really took over and dominated vs cable channels...imo the content trumps anything on the cable channels
1005406,mike rousseau,2017-06-04 22:54:00,4661,Looks like WFN and Wild tv are gone from Cogeca  Error code has been on all day  I'll have to call tomorrow as I lay rxtra for those 2 channels
1005409,leaf4,2017-06-04 23:48:00,2466,100%.  you don't ​have to​ sit through 10 minutes of commercials​ to watch 5 minutes of watered down fishing that's really just another commercial lol
1005421,Old Ironmaker,2017-06-05 02:08:00,8243,"I canceled it 5 years ago. The kid on the phone said it's only $1.99 a month Sir, I told him that he wants to pay it for me I'll keep it otherwise cancel it. It was frustrating watching the crap on there. 30 minute TV commercials other than a few good ones like the ""Tarpon Tour"" then they stopped showing that. Al Linder was my Guru when I started fishing, when I saw his new series I wanted to cry, if I want religion I'll go to church or watch the 700 Club or call some of my in-laws."
1005422,manitoubass2,2017-06-05 02:14:00,11391,"I fished with Al. Funny thing, he doesn't talk about religion at all. We hit up 5 mile pre fishing for the fort Frances bass classic for hours.  Before that, I had met him a year or two prior at the bait shop, same scenario. He gave my son a box of brand new clackin raps for free.  He's an awesome guy. Never understood why his show ends the way it does???"
1005426,Old Ironmaker,2017-06-05 02:29:00,8243,"It was maybe before he became reborn when you met him. I met him in T.O. 20 years ago and he sure wasn't religious then in the least, he sure didn't act like it."
1005427,manitoubass2,2017-06-05 02:33:00,11391,"That was about 7 years ago. He was already ranting on tv  He's keen to have a drink and a puff too.  But to be fair every ""pro"" I've fished with is.  It's like the pga but not quite as bad. Pga golfers, if your not a drug addict/alcoholic your outta the loop"
