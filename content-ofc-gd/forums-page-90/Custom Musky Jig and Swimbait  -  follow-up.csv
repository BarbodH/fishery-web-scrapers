1004009,landry,2017-05-20 02:18:00,1005,"  Last Fall, I posted a swimbait with a spinner blade that I poured at home. It was rudimentary but worked great and got me one especially fat 46"" musky last Fall.  I have spent the winter making molds of other baits and an improved mold of my swimbait. I will likely post some in the classified section but a few guys expressed some interest in the swimbait last Fall. If anyone wants one the just send me a PM and we can talk colours, price...  Anyways - jig is similar to Bondy bait with a heavier insert and .062 stainless wire. Action, balance and fatigue on arm is VERY similar to Bondy Baits - cause let's face it - he nailed it. Mine is more realistic and will be painted and can be custom ordered.  The swimbait has a removable Colorado blade, is slightly bigger than a Shadzilla and will also be painted. It has a great belly roll and tail kick.  The two baits pictured are just a taste -  still need eyes and paint touches. The silver sparkle is WAY brighter in real life. Gonna look great with a white belly and darker or chartreuse back."

1005910,Old Ironmaker,2017-06-10 02:11:00,8243,"Are you the ""Man With the Plan"" landry? Nothing better than doing something you would do for free. Not a Musky guy but they sure look like Esox magnets to me. Get in touch with Dan Columby and get him to try them, a member here and a highly experienced and respected Nipissing Musky guide. nipissingmuskies.com. If they are as good as they look he will know and will be a great ambassador for your product. Networking is the key to getting a new product out onto the market. I want to see these in every Canadian Tire, Bass Pro, Cabela's and Sail stores across North America. If you could use a partner contact Dragon's Den producers. Why not? I have a buddy who's brother went on there with a better, and ridiculous, Dog pooper scooper. They where the Steelworkers from Hamilton that had a chocolate bar coming out the fake Dogs end unit and Mr. Wonderful ate it. They didn't get a deal but are making some sales for 2 retired guys just because they got 7 minutes of priceless national marketing. Why not, get on the phone."
1005914,landry,2017-06-10 02:45:00,1005,Thanks guys. Really appreciate the compliments. I poured a ton of time into these over the last six months.  Like everything it was harder to get the perfect action and balance than I expected and of course I learned the most from the regular design screw ups.  For now I am selling small quantities to help cover my start up costs. I only have one of each mold so making large numbers isn't possible now.  I have a friend who has Chinese manufacturing contacts and he wants me to run a large quantity too. Lol. But to be honest it's like an art project for me and I really got into it for the love of fishing and as a creative endeavour. I just love Heli-Dawgs and I wanted a paddletail bait with a spinner idea which didn't exist for musky. I have a couple evil plans for other baits too. I still have my wooden masters and may make more molds this summer.
