One of the kids told his dad he wanted to go too and his dad texted me and so the plan was born. Turns out John knows this part of Lac Seul like the back of his hand so we exchanged a few spots between us. Jack and Zack had a great time too. Fish were still really shallow, between 2' and 7' FOW. Got to play with the drone too, some nice shots of our shore lunch spot of 'Secret Island'.  "
