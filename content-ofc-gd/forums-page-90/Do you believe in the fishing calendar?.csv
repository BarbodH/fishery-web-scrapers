1006329,Rattletrap2,2017-06-13 15:59:00,1652,"I'm a believer in the lunar calendars. I had a Fishntime watch from Casio that showed the major and minor periods each day. I also remember an old Hank Parker Outdoors episode back in the '80's where he said to pay attention to wildlife around you when getting ready to launch your boat. If the chipmunks and squirrels were out running about and the birds were actively flying around, then this was a good indication that all creatures would be doing the same, including those under the water. This would mean that fish should be active and away from cover feeding and cruising around. If it was the opposite, they might be shut down close to cover. I would think this has a lot to do with the weather and barometer, but also the magnetic pull of the moon. Makes good sense to me to be aware of what is happening in nature while we are out enjoying it. Hank was also a hunter and he made a lot of sense of things."
1006336,G.mech,2017-06-13 16:39:00,830,"The general consensus of the scientific community is that fish cannot directly sense changes in atmospheric pressure.  The pressure the atmosphere exerts on the surface of the water is only a tiny fraction of the pressure exerted on the fish by the water above it.   The 100 year record high & low pressures in this area are 31.04  & 28.30 "" Hg (inches of mercury) respectively.  Doing some math, this equates to a 2.74 "" Hg or 37"" of water difference between the extremes.  Typical swings are less than half of this.   So if a 3 foot wave passes over a fish or the fish swims up or down in the water column by 3 feet it would feel exactly the same change as the 100 year extremes would exert.  Since the fish cannot tell the difference between water pressure or air pressure, it really can't tell whether the barometric pressure is changing or the depth of water above it.  All that being said, the fish do seem to sense changing weather patterns in a number of other ways including light, waves, clouds, etc so they should be smart enough to know to come in out of the rain even if we don't!   I'm not sure about the calendar/moon thingy but I know the bright moonlit nights keep the walleye feeding."

Dont know if I have cared much for moon phases, because if i get the opportunity to fish Im gonna fish it...  Weather on the other hand...can sometimes put a ""damp""-er on things...it doesnt mean Im not gonna fish it...it just means I should know what to expect while I am out on the water."

Lol  Weather it's barometric pressure or not, there is something about it that turns on a frantic feed For sure. I would also suggest that it probably starts up to two hours earlier. Here's another for sure. I first learned to fish Lakers from an old childhood friend in the early 80's using leadcore or copper and gang trolls. I really fell for trolling back then as we explored Kipawa for many years, and its still is my preferred technique. He told me way back then that thunderstorms turn Lake Trout off big time and was he ever right.  Even the next morning could still be dead. And it's not the lightning, it's the thunder. Go figure that one eh? I wonder if it happens on the great lakes too for other species?  Cheers"

I mean , there's no way I could have done something wrong and gotten skunked right! In the end I think it comes down to right place at the right time with the right bait and putting it in front of their face enough."

I myself don't believe them but my dad seems to thing they are accurate. I've seen him not want to go out on beautiful days just because the little fishy on his calendar says its not suppose to be a good day. Hogwash I say!"

November to Feb I have the blues (until i retire to somewhere warmer)  However, I will say that fishing for kings after a full moon on a clear night in July has proven to be a great way to wash lures for a few hours, more than once.

1005790,Joeytier,2017-06-08 05:11:00,3990,That's pretty well what I was gonna say.  Absolutely the lunar cycle plays a role but its only one piece of a huge puzzle.
1005791,fishindevil,2017-06-08 10:06:00,6254,the moon cycle def matters but I base my fishing success more on the weather and barometer more than anything and depending on what species im after it can make a huge difference as well as the water im fishing weather or not its clear water or stained....but still anytime to go fishing is a bonus and I wont let any 1 thing be my decision maker and usually just go for it....in all types of weather....and because I have crewed on a salmon charter for many many years as well as grew up fishing walleyes you have to be good at adapting that's the bottom line .....

Cheers  But we know Smits that most muskie guys are nutcases. lol  Kept track of moon phase for about the first 9-10 years of keeping a fishing journal.  In that, catches or best guesstimates of catches were also recorded.  That's a long period of time to detail actually.  Full and new moons are best for walleye and pike numbers caught / activity of fish.  That said, (like it has been the case for muskie too in more recent years) the last quarter moon has been good for bigger fish."

I will assume they are based on the lunar phases which I do believe have an impact on fishing. But as said above, I think weather conditions play a more important role.  The trick here is fish eat in all conditions. You just need to change presentations for different conditions. Once you sort out what works in different scenarios, that calendar wont matter anymore.

Last year on the super moon we slayed birds.  I don't plan my fishing days on the lunar calendar, but when it is a good day, I will make sure I am in a good spot for the max times for sure.

Barometric pressure is way more important for me. If a storm is moving in, im doing my best to be out. If your on a good spot before the storm hits, the fishing is usually insane! Of course you gotta be safe with that too, make sure you can get out before the storm hits etc. But that's hands down my favorite time to fish"
