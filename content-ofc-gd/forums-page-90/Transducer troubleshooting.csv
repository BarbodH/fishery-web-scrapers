1006121,Mister G,2017-06-12 12:04:00,1429,"That's not a smidge. Is it level to the surface when not at WOT? You may be receiving a picture when stopped that is nowhere under the boat, especially in deep water. I agree 1.5 to 2"" is not a smidge but I'm thinking he's over exaggerating.......but so what if the sonar beam is shooting a bit forward and even slightly ahead of the boat in deep water.....if your trolling this is helpful.  Bottom line, tilting the back of the transducer down a little corrects the problem of not having any readings at high speed which could be a VERY dangerous situation in unfamiliar waters.  Glad to hear he got it going.........."
1006158,Old Ironmaker,2017-06-12 15:42:00,8243,"Yep Mr. G. better tilted down than up but I was taking the inches tilted literally. In 10' of water no big deal in 300 feet of water depending on cone angle you may be 100's of feet in front of the boat. I know someone a lot better in arithmetic than I could even figure the exact number.  You could mark fish well before your presentation gets to it trolling. It may be advantageous actually when running full out to see what's well ahead of your boat. You will get a shallow water alarm before you hit the shallow water, which depending how fast you are going is usually too late."

I concur all  your above points.........the only problem could be that the fish arks will not be perfect but rather 3/4 or 1/2 arks and so what........the most important is high speed reading, I sure we can all agree on............or . . . . . . . . . .LOL"
1006229,b_cdot,2017-06-12 23:16:00,270,"Compared to where I had it with it tilted up slightly, 1.5 inches got it pretty level with the hull. I will post pics asap and you can see. 1.5 inches really isn't as much as you might think compared to how it was. If its angled towards the front of the boat it is very minimal and probably negligible for the water I fish."
1006230,b_cdot,2017-06-12 23:20:00,270,And maybe you might be right. Maybe exaggerating. I didn't have a ruler just tried to get it more even with the haul and slightly and i mean slightly tilted down.
1006231,b_cdot,2017-06-12 23:25:00,270,"That's not a smidge. Is it level to the surface when not at WOT? You may be receiving a picture when stopped that is nowhere under the boat, especially in deep water.   That is the exact reason why I had it tilted up slightly before because with the transom of the boat being lower at rest I was trying to do a rough compensation to get a straight down picture. It worked good at rest. I could see my jig right under the boat in 40fow jigging right off the transom. But once I got up on plane I'd lose bottom pretty quick. I want the best of both worlds its some super fine tuning for that transducer if you ask me."

1006303,b_cdot,2017-06-13 14:51:00,270,I figured it out lol

1006324,Mister G,2017-06-13 15:39:00,1429,here it is It looks VERY good IMHO......
1006337,G.mech,2017-06-13 16:43:00,830,Is it the small transducer you are concerned with or the large structure scan one?  The SS one doesn't look bad but the small one is too high...if the manufacturer is right it should have the horizontal centreline of the transducer even with the bottom of the boat.

1006389,b_cdot,2017-06-14 00:46:00,270,Might take a pic from the back. Be a better view
1006391,b_cdot,2017-06-14 00:50:00,270,The normal skimmer works great at high speeds when its hooked up. I leave it connected as a backup in case totalscan has problems.
1006654,b_cdot,2017-06-16 04:26:00,270,this is a pic of the transducers relative to the haul line. Great readings at high speed (40+mph) now 
1006655,b_cdot,2017-06-16 04:32:00,270,tilted down a bit from the first pic. They are picky transducers. Very fine tuning
1004944,b_cdot,2017-05-30 04:13:00,270,Just bought a Lowrance Totalscan transducer the start of the year. I noticed when travelling 30+mph I lose my sonar view completely and sometimes my depth reading. Even when traveling 10-20+mph it's a crappy sonar picture. My old transducer would pick up great views at higher speeds. I could tell when I was travelling over a weed bed or a drop off going 40+mph. Not anymore. Has anyone had this problem? Could it be mounted wrong? I was told to try and have half the transducer below the hull and the other half above... if that makes any sense. Here is a picture. Any suggestions? 
1004946,Dan668,2017-05-30 05:06:00,1120,"Not the same transducer, but similar in size, my lss-2 is mounted about 1/8"" above the bottom of the hull. But it's only used for down and side imaging.  The manual for the total scan states to mount even with hull so I would try raising it a tad."
1004947,b_cdot,2017-05-30 05:13:00,270,That's likely less than an inch. They are picky transducers I guess. I know its likely due to water turbulence but man it's gotta be so exact or youre screwed.
1004961,porkpie,2017-05-30 12:10:00,2521,Mine is the same and it throws a hella big rooster tail into the motor as well.  Love the unit otherwise!  I'm going to raise mine as well.
1004980,Dan668,2017-05-30 16:18:00,1120,"Mine throws a big rooster too, they fixed it on the totalscan transducer which uses a newer bracket. I have to pick one up as it's compatible with my lss-2.  Water turbulence is most likely the issue, these long ones don't like to be mounted below unlike the skimmer transducers."
1004982,JoshS,2017-05-30 16:27:00,729,If you used to get good readings at 40mph that seems like an anomaly to me. That's possible? I've never seen it.  I thought getting a reading at 25mph was pretty good....  No interference on the screen over 10mph would seem pretty good to me. But I'm not a fishfinder guru. I get a lot of interference on mine when travelling at any speeds and loose it around 20-25.
1004983,DRIFTER_016,2017-05-30 16:52:00,10439,I have two big Garmin ones to install on my boat this weekend. Going to be fun trying to tune these things. My current skimmer transducer on my old Lowrance has no issue reading bottom in 300' at 35-40 MPH. My Elite 5 DSI loses bottom at 20 MPH. Hopefully these Garmins read at speed or I'm gonna have a whole herd of finders on my console!!!!
1004993,Garnet,2017-05-30 17:35:00,2056,I think those rivets are fine.  Is that other transducer in use. And if so the wires are likely together. bad bad bad.  Are the transducer cables mixed in with a bunch of other wires. bad bad bad.  Are your units wired thru fuse panel. bad bad bad.  Does your transducer cables lay across your battery's bad bad bad.  Yes I'm sure it's poor installation.
1005006,porkpie,2017-05-30 19:01:00,2521,"They may have hoped to, but I don't think they did.  Either that or my install is bad bad bad lol."

1005041,DRIFTER_016,2017-05-31 00:20:00,10439,  What transducer did you get with your Garmin Drifter ?  My Echomap Chirp 93sv unit has a CV52HW-TM and my Echomap 74Ssv non-chirp unit came with a GT41-TM. They are different frequency units which is good for interference. Going to use the 74sv for navigation and the 93sv as a finder. The non-chirp ducer is twice the size of the chirp one.  
1005063,Dan668,2017-05-31 03:54:00,1120,"Damn, maybe I'll save my $80, expensive bracket."
1005066,Garnet,2017-05-31 10:14:00,2056,Lawren works at Radioworld has a tutorial on good fishfinder install. Maybe check with Misfish.
1005068,NANUK,2017-05-31 10:38:00,797, Do you plan on using them in US and coastal waters ?
1005086,Mister G,2017-05-31 14:09:00,1429,EASY FIX in about 2 minutes or less.......  Simply loosen transducer adjustment and tilt the back of the transducer DOWN just a little bit so it now throws the sonar beam slightly towards the bow.........this will insure a constant flow of water over the ENTIRE surface of the transducer......high speed reading at ANY speed......
1005093,DRIFTER_016,2017-05-31 15:32:00,10439,Do you plan on using them in US and coastal waters ?  No I don't but they were on sale. I bought them for the Quickdraw as none of our waters are mapped.
1005097,b_cdot,2017-05-31 16:02:00,270, Great discussion everyone. Thanks for replies. I just recently tilted it up thinking i would get a better view of structure scan when traveling at low speed due to the transom sitting lower at those speeds. Obviously that was probably my big mistake. I tilted it down slightly. I will follow up with results. I can see how a slight tilt of the transducer can really increase turbulence and disrupt clean water flow across it evenly.
1005101,b_cdot,2017-05-31 16:42:00,270,JoshS I am talking about my 2D sonar not structure or side scanning. With proper installation your 2D sonar shouldn't lose bottom at higher speeds.
1005522,Wheels,2017-06-05 23:58:00,28,I am having the same iisues
1005542,porkpie,2017-06-06 00:58:00,2521,"I raised my totalscan just a touch and am getting a decent reading at 35mph.  Good enough for me.  Spray issue is reduced, but still present."
1005886,AdamS,2017-06-09 22:35:00,161,I noticed something similar on mine. I've only tried it out once but I noticed I lost my depth reading when on plane.. Well the map was showing 20ft and the depth was showing 1.5..scared me for a second but fortunately the fish I caught shortly after made me forget until now. if I can get out tommorow I'll check the sonar part. Let us know how it works with the ducer tilted down.
1005925,b_cdot,2017-06-10 03:56:00,270,"Way better. Tilted it down literally a smidge 1.5-2"" and its all good!!"
1005934,Old Ironmaker,2017-06-10 07:20:00,8243,"I had a huge rooster tail on my Humminbird when I installed it a few years ago. Went on their site and talked to a customer service tech. They actually sell a rubber insert that fills the void in the bracket. Humminbird said they are free but rather than wait for it from the US I bought one for 5 bucks at the Marine dealer. Buddy had the same issue on a new Garmin and he simply filled the void with 3M 4200. His rooster tail went away as well. I have a Bird sonar and a Garmin on the dash. I adjusted both while in the water one day with my dive mask, PFD and fins on then buddy took the boat out at WOT. Got both to read at high speed and accurate trolling. No other boat traffic anywhere close that day and had my dive flag with me."
1006110,AdamS,2017-06-12 02:53:00,161,Glad to hear it was an easy fix! I didn't get out this weekend but next time I go I'll be doing the same.
