I see one of those fancy broil burners in the back ground.   Cut your potato wedges and put in a bowl with about a tablespoon of olive oil, a splash of balsamic vinegar, a sprinkle of dried parsley and I usually just season with some Lawry's seasoning salt but you could use Cajun or your favourite Mrs. Dash. Toss the potatoes so they are covered and grill over heat for 20 to 25 minutes, I usually grill with everything on low and the lid just cracked, that's my hi tech rock in the foreground for keeping the lid ajar, the thermometer will read about 375 to 400 like that.  I use that enamelled tray a lot for all sorts of grilled veggies. The burner in the background is a ceramic rotisserie burner, works real good too , just remember to put a drip tray under the meat to save a mess. It's just a CTC Centro that I got when I retired in 2008 but I've been really pleased with it."

1006395,Dutch01,2017-06-14 01:06:00,1431,"I like to cut zucchini, peppers onions etc into chunks, toss in oil and your favorite spices and  grill em up. After they're done put them in a glass bowl with a half chevre of goat cheese. Cover with foil and let it melt in. It's super good."
1006507,smitty55,2017-06-15 03:33:00,928,"A cast iron fry pan also works great for veggies on the grill. I was shown this method well over 20 years ago. I was kind of skeptical at first when he told me about the method but I sure am glad I tried it.  Fill pan with cut up potatoes, onions, garlic cloves, peppers, shrooms, carrots etc. Add maybe half a cup of zesty Italian dressing, mix and dot with butter. Grind some fresh pepper over top and spice as you like and then sprinkle well with fresh grated parm. Cover with foil and into the closed grill or use a rock to prop open a bit.  Timing is the key, I like things just starting to brown in the pan, usually I'll check progress around the 30-35 minute mark. Sometimes I'll take the foil off for the last 10 minutes. Plus the whole pan can go on the table, serve from it and things stay hot for a good while in case of seconds. You will definitely be impressed. And you won't do it just once I can safely say.  Cheers   Edit: As for the OP I've got a good story lol. My wife can be a bit blond at times. One of the first times I brought her out to my country home 25 minutes from Kanata we went by a small farm and there were some horses running free in a 50 acre field. So she's all excited and says ""Oh look. Wild horses."" I rest my case."
1006510,Old Ironmaker,2017-06-15 06:20:00,8243,"Rather than spice them the way you like please try Montreal Steak Spice for all your veggies and meats. It is our house ""spice"". We use that s^%* on everything as the hot sauce lady says. Don't add any salt or anything, it's all in there and all perfectly balanced. Just try it once, please. I have a non stick BBQ tray with holes in it with high sides that is supposed to be a fish BBQ pan. That's what I use for the BBQ veggie stir fry. I don't put the soft veggies like mushrooms, zucchini and eggplant until the harder vegs like carrots and potatoes start to get fork soft. I just give it wash with a soft cloth and dish soap. It is seasoned now like a Wok.  The goat cheese which my wife loves is going in a bowl covered like you suggest tomorrow, great idea. If it wasn't so late the Q would be fired up now."
