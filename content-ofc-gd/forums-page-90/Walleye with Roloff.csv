Got out for an hour or so in the evening the other night, headed to a midwater reef on Wabigoon that will take your skeg off in low water years. Fished in the 4'-9' range close to the drop and was rewarded with numerous small walleye, pretty much a fish a cast on bobbers and jigging 1/8oz lead jigs. Tried a variety of baits as you can see in the video, leeches were the best that evening.  "
