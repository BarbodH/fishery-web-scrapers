1005228,Garfisher,2017-06-02 14:18:00,229,Balsam never needed a slot. It had fabulous amount of fish in every year class. The problem was they used trap nets that sat in 8 ft and went to shore missing 99% of the walleye. You're right they should have set gill nets so that they could cover more areas (and remove those walleye instead of being able to release them)

Seems there is...""I believe that there is a wealth of knowledge that longtime residents and anglers can provide to science"", and then he quoted passed along ideas and observations.  But what is surprising to me is all the personal reports how the walleye fishing is at it's peak ever or getting to it's peak in all the lakes even though Skugog is closed and the other lakes have slots.  That doesn't compute with what the MP states unless either all the lake have had a fantastic rebound at the same time or personal reports could reflect a bias.  Not that anyone is doing this in this instance but I might just report the fishing as being better than it is and crap all over those who manage the fishery if I were at all fearful my lake would be closed or get a slot that I didn't want.  I love hearing those first hand reports and rely on them for my personal fishing but in the end give me the cold hard data for management issues. "

""  I am old, so maybe a clearer picture of the chain of events? Or just a different view of them?  Walleye fishing in Lake Erie went to heck in the 50's, fishermen from Ohio, PA, NY, Mi and other states headed north to catch them. Once the rebound in Lake Erie started the need to travel hundreds of miles to catch them became unnecessary? I know very few people that used to head north for walleye that still do."

So do other zones but FMZ17 is rather close to most in the GTA and less travel time vs going up the 400.  Also the Trent water mgt is key to making sure the walleye egg's are not left on dry land as they open up and move water from lake to lake.  This is part of the problem and why Scugog is closed for walleye.  Over fishing and not managing water levels properly.  Maybe it's time to start talking stocking or review the slot in place?  I do not know.  However I do know that most of the walleye I caught last year and so far this year are over the slot.  Last year I'd say 70% were out of the slot and most over the 50cm mark.  I back this James person's ideas to from the brief read on the links."

I was happy with what I saw on the lake I fish.  It looked good for future opportunities.

I really don't think the tourney does a lot of damage, but a lot of it depends on conditions. If its too hot, its bad, bad, bad. I've been catching lots of over slot fish for a few seasons now, loads and loads of unders, and more than enough keepers to have a meal any time I want. I've caught some of the biggest walleye ive ever caught from the kawartha's the last couple years. These lakes are constantly changing, and the fish are constantly adapting.

How can you literally have two totally different sets of logic for the exact same species in place within 200km of each other...  I personally dont see how allowing people to harvest the biggest fish is good for any fishery. You are literally destroying the gene pool. I shudder at the thought of people throwing 2 lb 16 inch pickerels back while keeping a 9lber. Bloody ridiculous.

I am personally of the opinion that keeping big fish is the wrong way about things. The most important fish are the fish that are spawning...if they continue to spawn and are protected, there should be a concern about the fact that some of smaller ones are being taken. They represent the biggest portion of fish at that point. Pickerel live a long time and it doesnt take long for them to start going over slot...once they are there why stop them from growing to their full potential?"

With a S-lic you get to keep 1x over 50cm and the others must be in the 35-50cm.  with a C-lic no over/under.  That could bring a better balance as Sinker was saying, let's the smaller ones grow up as the big old predator is removed.

I see the 30 inch eyes that come out of the inland lakes and the fish look old ugly and haggard.  the two biggest eyes we caught on Gbay were 8 and 9lbs respectively...both were not over 27 inches long and both were absolutely spotless. They looked as healthy as any of the hundreds of small fish we caught. I find it very very difficult to believe that these perfect specimens of walleye are in worse spawning shape than the big haggard monsters that folks are pulling out of the kawarthas.  you be the judge...this fish doesnt even have a nick on its fins    Im convinced that there are plenty of 10lb+ eyes in lake huron/georgian bay and if such is the case, no one is going to convince me that a .5lb 16 inch fish is already starting to get into the prime of its life and will be done and washed up once it grows another 4 inches and gains another 1.5lbs"

I was there at closure and there was a lot of anger that the Feds were taking away the fishery. None of the fishermen I saw and talked to were lamenting the ""delay"" in the ban. So that's the problem with first hand observation, in that you can have two totally different accounts of the same thing and sometimes that isn't an innocent thing. Strictly going on the opinions of others to make huge decisions can lead to incredibly bad decision making such as the US pulling out of the Paris Accord today.

I was fishing all the Kawrathas 40 years ago and you could catch tons of 16 inch walleye. Today fishing is better in that you never know what your next bite will be. In practice for Canada US I caught 2 over 5 a 6 and a 7.5. Rice was the same Tri lakes a little balanced fishing.  They need to get something wrote by Crossman or change will never happen. He is the guy that wrote the green book on species. You will hear direct Quotes from his book at every meeting with MNR.
