1005607,_al87_outdoors,2017-06-06 16:41:00,22,"Hey all, Just thought I would share a photo of my 2017 opening day musky and introduce myself. I have been a member of the forum for a few years but am just getting into posting and sharing. My dad, a.k.a rattletrap 2, has been on here for years and now that I am such an avid outdoors woman with a thirst for knowledge he said this is a place I might like to spend some time.  I fish regularly, for any fish but have a real passion for slaying musky these days. I am also a novice bow hunter, looking to get more into it this coming fall.  A big thanks to Mike over at handlebarz lures, and his double 8s in a custom colour from the muskey oddesey I was able to bring this beauty bruiser aboard within the first half hour of my opening day up in the kawarthas.  I look forward to sharing and learning from and with you all. "
