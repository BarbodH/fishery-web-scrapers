Here's a pic of a Small Fish my Youngest Niece Caught, when I 1st saw it I thought it was a Minnow of some kind due to the Size but afterwords looking at the Picture, I think it's a Young Smallie?:   & Here's 2 Pics my Sister in Law took of me With my Crappie, My Youngest Niece Photobombed one of them:  "

1004164,Lord Letto,2017-05-22 21:52:00,70,"Hi all, 1st post here since 2013 before me & my family went up to the French River.  Anyway, IIRC I Haven't Went Fishing since then, but we'll be going up there this year for a week around the Canada Day Long Weekend, I think it's Rainbow Camp we'll be staying at though so it'll be a different part of the French this time (Was at Loons Landing last time, that's on Dry Pine Bay, this time when we go up it'll be the North Channel). To prepare for the Vacation I went & bought a Rod & Reel of my own last week, a Shakespeare Catch More Fish Walleye then yesterday me, my brother & uncle went & got our Outdoors Card & Sport Licence (1 Year for me & my brother, 3 Years for my uncle). To wet some line the family went Fishing today on the Conestogo River, 1st Stop was Glen Allan where we Fished for awhile but had no luck, then we drove around for a while looking for another spot. We ended up stopping just outside Wallenstein at the Line 86 Bridge, after a while of fishing, my youngest niece got the 1st catch of the year, a Small Catfish:  I Had a few nibbles but no luck, hopefully me, my brother & uncle can go back there next weekend while my sister in law & nieces are gone to Girl Guide Camp, maybe we can use lures next time instead of Bobbers & Worms, i'm itching to try my Silver Honeycomb Williams Wabler, seeing as Bass is OOS & I caught a Walleye & Pike in the past, my target next weekend if we go is a Brownie (Brown Trout)."
1004165,TJQ,2017-05-22 22:05:00,7806,Welcome Back and good luck!
1004184,chris.brock,2017-05-23 02:30:00,4053," Welcome back.  I've fished out of Rainbow Camp for many years, the same week you are planning to go. PM me for a couple of tips if you want. Great scenery, great owners, you're going to have fun. Say ""Hi"" to Noella."
1004195,LittleWorm,2017-05-23 05:21:00,122,Welcome back to the forums. Im also new here but have discovered it is full of awesome people willing to help you improve your fishing game. Any questions just ask and someone is always there to help you.
1004810,Lord Letto,2017-05-28 19:24:00,70,"Me, Mom & my Uncle went back to fishing yesterday, spent some time there but no luck, more bad luck for me as I decided to try using a lure. Couldn't find my Silver Williams Wabler so Ended using my Perch Storm Kickin' Minnow, after some practice casting it out & retrieving using stop & go/lift & drop it ended up snagging on the bottom but my Uncle ended up getting it free, done more practice while my uncle was gone back to the Jeep to try putting a lure on for him to try, while he was gone I ended up getting snagged again & in the process of trying to get it unsnagged the line broke & I lost the lure, instead of risking losing another lure I went back to hook & bobber. Today we went back again, I ended up having some nibbles but that was it, my Uncle on the other hand ended up catching a Small Perch (I Think? I say small, but I haven't seen a normal sizes Perch, but it's bigger than the small things I caught 4 years ago on the French River):   We kept it with plans to maybe cut it up to use as bait instead of worms (However in hindsight after some Research, I'm not sure if it's allowed or not, if it's a Yellow Perch then likely not, at least not the edible parts, the uneatable parts (Head, Fins, Guts, ETC) could be used, but if it's a Trout-Perch then it can be used as a Bait Fish.) After that we kept fishing for a while with no luck. While we were packing up getting ready to leave though I looked around In the water & came across something I thought was a school of Tadpoles or Minnows, but my uncle said it could be young/baby Trout with thorns on the side? I tried to take some pics but it was really hard to identify them so I didn't bother keeping them. then shortly after that we saw some kind of animal swim across the water & climb up on the shore & run off, my Uncle ran off back to the Jeep not knowing what it was & I caught a glimpse of it (Looked Black to me?) but couldn't get a good look to identify it & my Mom didn't see it, our guesses are that it was either a Otter or a Mink. While loading up the Jeep I Took 2 pics of a sign that's in the parking area there: Species (Stocked Brown Trout, Northern Pike, Stocked Walleye & Smallmouth Bass):  And a map (We were at Spot #4 on the Map):   Here's a pic from last weekend I didn't think about posting before, a Heron we saw when we got to Glen Allan:   I also confirmed with my Brother that it's Rainbow Camp we're going to for the Canada Day Long Weekend, cottage & boat w/ Motor is booked & deposit is paid for the week, It's just a matter of everyone going to pay their share of the costs.  We might be going back Fishing after supper, but I doubt it."
1004811,OhioFisherman,2017-05-28 20:10:00,6623,"The little fish appears to be one of the many types of minnows, if you continue fishing work on your fish identification and laws, there are various size limits and species limits."
1004813,Lord Letto,2017-05-28 21:01:00,70,"The little fish appears to be one of the many types of minnows, if you continue fishing work on your fish identification and laws, there are various size limits and species limits. Yep, your correct about it being a Minnow, IDK Why I thought it was a Perch. As for type of Minnow, I'm thinking some kind of Shiner due to the Forked Tail."
1004822,Lord Letto,2017-05-29 00:13:00,70,"Went back with my Uncle after supper (Got there about 10 after 6), Managed to Get my 1st Catch of the Year That's also the 1st Catch with my new Rod, it was a Minnow of some kind, different than the one my Uncle caught earlier today: "
1004823,Rich Clemens,2017-05-29 00:25:00,3131,Good luck at Rainbow.  My wife and I have been going there every year for at least a dozen or so years now.    We'll be there in mid-September for a week of chasing Muskies.  That little stretch has treated me quite well over the years.
1004828,chris.brock,2017-05-29 00:50:00,4053, Those are creek chub. Good you got out and posted a report. Nice job!
1005311,Lord Letto,2017-06-04 02:36:00,70,"Another Update: Went Fishing by Myself Today, got Dropped Off at the Fishing Spot Today to do 3-3.5 Hours of Solo Fishing, and Long Story Short, I only caught 1 Fish & I got a New Lure Yesterday that I got about a dozen or so casts with before I left with no luck. The Fish I caught, Not Sure if a Small/Young Smallmouth, or a Sunfish of some kind, if a Bass it was my 1st Bass, either way I released it cause I know Bass is OOS & I'm not interested in keeping Sunfish:    As for the New Lure, I wanted a Top Water Lure for when I go Fishing there, so I went to Canadian Tire Yesterday & Bought a Lunkerhunt Kraken Popper with the Eruption Scheme: http://www.lunkerhunt.com/kraken_popper.html Never used it till like the last 15 minutes or so with no luck, was mainly Fishing with Hook & Bobber with Worms on that was bought like 3 Weeks ago so need to be used up."
1005328,Old Ironmaker,2017-06-04 13:16:00,8243,"Welcome back. You have Rock Bass there. There are no restrictions on them and I can tell you they get to a nice size and they are tasty if you eat fish. I know new lures are expensive and I hate loosing them too. But if you want to catch some bigger fish on the French you have to risk using them rather that a float and worm. Buy some worm harnesses and a few weights and troll them on the French. Much less expensive than basic plugs and spoons. If you are set on still fishing buy some good ""pencil"" floats and stay away from the plastic Red and white bobbers. A sportsfish will feel the mass of that bobber when hitting you bait and spit it out. I do like still fishing in Florida for Sea Trout when we fish off the piers, and we always still fish for Perch."
1005338,Lord Letto,2017-06-04 16:01:00,70,"10-4 on the Rock Bass, I'll keep that in mind. as for lures, I already plan on using them up at the French (I Have a Spoon, Spinner & that new Popper I got along with 2 Jig Heads with some 3"" Powerbait (Grubs & Minnows) & a Night Crawler Harness rig), it's just where I'm fishing for now(Conostogo River at the Line 86 Bridge outside Wallenstein) isn't Very deep so it's safer to use Hook & Bobber or Top Water Lures. Any inexpensive Pencil/Slip Floats you guys recommend? I was looking when I got my new Lure at Canadian Tire but I'm not sure what to look for when it comes to Bobbers/Floats, I'm currently using a Orange (Foam?) Bobber that my brother had."

1005359,manitoubass2,2017-06-04 17:40:00,11391,"I use Northland personally  But jigs are jigs. Only difference really is weight, colour and the hook quality.  Get whatever ya can. I'd get some 1/4 and some 3/8 so so can fish shallow or deep. Obviously a 3/8 cast alot better and you can fish them shallow as well, you just need to speed up the retrieve.  For grubs I'd get 3"", in black, white, chartruesse, etc just to have a variety. Any brand will do really."

I probably wouldn't bother with 1/16th ounce jigheads, unless you are getting them from a specialist source the hooks in them will most likely be too small,1/8th to 3/8ths should be good, and for most fishing black or white works fine."
1005381,Lord Letto,2017-06-04 20:14:00,70,"10-4, thanks for the Tips.

1005383,manitoubass2,2017-06-04 20:29:00,11391,"Just get a nylon stringer at Canadian tire. There blue and coat like $3  Is it safe to say your a novice?( I don't mean any offense)  I have tonnes of tackle I can donate, much of it brand new. I usually give it to kids, but im out with an injury for the season and can't fish, would make me feel good to help ya out!  Im not shipping jigs though lol, cost a fortune"
1005385,Old Ironmaker,2017-06-04 20:36:00,8243,"Just don't buy anything from Red Wolf. They are cheap Chinese products. You can always tip your jig with a piece of worm or minnow along with the grub you choose. I don't want to tell you how many ""thousands"" of dollars worth of lure most of us each here own. You are going to loose some, guaranteed, it's all in the cost of fishing, just like loosing golf balls when golfing, it's gonna happen. As far as a stringer buy a good steel clip stringer and stay away from plastic keeper types. Fish will get off them. I've seen grown men cry after lifting the stringer to find 1/2 the fish or all got off. I'd rather use a rope. You a lucky guy Rick.  Call or email the place you are staying, they will answer all your question you have for the rentals etc.  You are in a great location for fishing. I know we here are very happy you have chosen to share in the addiction we all have. Welcome aboard."
