1006070,DRIFTER_016,2017-06-11 22:43:00,10439,"My buddy bought this boat late last fall. He bought it without a motor and the trailer needed lots of work. Let's start with the trailer. We lengthened the tongue 3' redid the bunks, replaced all the bunk hardware, installed a different winch tower off a different trailer. We also replaced the tongue jack, winch cable, lighting and all wiring as well as adding stainless boat buckles and galvanized guide-on's. Lastly we repainted the whole trailer with truck bedliner and added a spare tire carrier.  Onto the boat. I installed a 2016 off lease 90hp Merc from the same dealer I got mine from a few years ago. Also added the MercMonitor gauge, controls etc. Completely rewired the boat and built a new helm station to replace the 1980's vinyl one. I used scratch resistant Lexan painted from the rear to match the boat and backed it up with plywood. I installed a switch panel with built in breakers to run the electrics. Also installed a new horn, bilge pump and bilge pump control panel as well as the sonar out of his old boat and my old VHF and antenna. And finally on the transom are a new set of Smart Tabs trim tabs to smooth out the ride and allow the boat to plane at lower speeds.  Today we had it out for it's maiden voyage and it ran great!!! With the tabs it will get on plane and stay there at 12-15MPH when you pin the throttle at 20 MPH it just jumps up and rockets!!!! Top speed was 38.4MPH on the GPS and I should be able to get 1 or 2 more when I do a little tuning on the tabs. As a bonus I got my dock installed as well!!!                      "
1006075,porkpie,2017-06-11 23:18:00,2521,Good lookin boat!
1006092,leaf4,2017-06-12 00:26:00,2466,Nice work that is a sweet setup!
1006104,LeXXington,2017-06-12 01:30:00,1928,wow nice work
1006105,Joeytier,2017-06-12 01:40:00,3990,That is a clean machine.
1006109,livinisfishin,2017-06-12 01:57:00,661,That's identical to my boat but looking pretty sweet!
1006113,Old Ironmaker,2017-06-12 03:36:00,8243,"A StarCraft and a Merc, it doesn't get any better. Great job."
1006116,Dan668,2017-06-12 04:04:00,1120,"Very clean, looks great!"
1006152,DRIFTER_016,2017-06-12 15:25:00,10439,Thanks guys. I'm pretty happy with how it turned out.
1006154,Old Ironmaker,2017-06-12 15:33:00,8243,"Dave I just noticed how that boat is tied to your dock. Or you just parked it like that to get pics maybe.  That Eagle painted the same Ferrari red would be off the chart. Ferrari calls it ""Sangua Rosa"" blood red.  Trivia of the day, Ferrari has more than 20 shades of red."
1006156,DRIFTER_016,2017-06-12 15:37:00,10439,"Dave I just noticed how that boat is tied to your dock. What happens when you get on shore winds? Or you just parked it like that to get pics maybe.  That Eagle painted the same Ferrari red would be off the chart. Trivia of the day, Ferrari has more than 20 shades of red.  It was tied like that as we were there to install the dock. This is what it looks like now and how you park the yacht.  "
1006167,Rattletrap2,2017-06-12 16:43:00,1652,Very nice work! Looks great!
1006188,Can_38,2017-06-12 18:41:00,152,"Good work, the dash looks amazing."
1006190,Tomcat,2017-06-12 19:07:00,395,Nice work on the boat!  I would appreciate learning the steps you took to install the dock.
1006196,DRIFTER_016,2017-06-12 19:54:00,10439,Nice work on the boat!  I would appreciate learning the steps you took to install the dock.  pretty simple really. I store the one section on top of the shore mounted ramp. I just slide it out and put in the pins. I then slide my main section off a large sloping piece of shoreline granite and float it over to the dock and put the pins in. Then I just have to attach my 4 chains and a weight off the end. Takes about an hour and I can do it by myself. It's always nice when I have a second set of hands though.
1006199,misfish,2017-06-12 20:22:00,29133,"Starcraft boats, the older ones, cant beat them. Nice fix up Dave. Looks sweet."
1006235,Tom S,2017-06-12 23:55:00,362,I really like the look of the back-painted lexan dash. Looks super and should hold up well.
1006508,LittleWorm,2017-06-15 05:17:00,122,Excellent job!
1006509,Old Ironmaker,2017-06-15 06:03:00,8243,"That Lexan is amazing stuff, is it expensive Dave? I just picked up a 72' Vespa, would it look amazing done in Lexan or what? I would pick one of the more than 20 Ferrari reds. Looking for a second scooter or replace my old Harley. My lady just got her bike licence at the age of 52. I'm so proud of her. Once she gets on a real bike she may reconsider a Honda 50. Then I don't have to ride down the lakeshore incognito!"
1006572,DRIFTER_016,2017-06-15 17:17:00,10439,I don't know pricing as my buddy has the stuff at work and we used a piece out of the offcut bin. The stuff I used is called MakroloAR. It is abrasion resistant and UV stabilized. Check with your local glass shops for pricing and availability. Full sheets are gonna be very expensive so hope they have small pieces or offcuts.   http://www.sheets.covestro.com/Products/Americas/Makrolon/Makrolon-AR.aspx
