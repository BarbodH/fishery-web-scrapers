1005430,Carp,2017-06-05 02:41:00,1488,Yup !  Just saw this earlier today in their flyer. Great deal !
1005431,Woodsman,2017-06-05 02:44:00,1286,Yes great deal. I use that crap in everything.
1005432,Lord Letto,2017-06-05 03:11:00,70,I use that crap in everything. Automotive Franks RedHot?
1005436,Old Ironmaker,2017-06-05 04:14:00,8243,Tune up in a can. I have some but never used it. The instructions on the bottle are so small I can't read it with a magnifying glass. How much should one use? I think my tank is around 15 to 20 gallons. Float is stuck it either shows full or 1/4.
1005455,Rattletrap2,2017-06-05 15:28:00,1652,Really good deal! I bought some in the US a couple of years back and thought I got a great deal at $6.99 per can US.

How much should one use? I think my tank is around 15 to 20 gallons. Float is stuck it either shows full or 1/4.  This won't help you much but I've used it straight out of the can into the carbs and I've mixed it in the fuel.  From their website...
1005462,Old Ironmaker,2017-06-05 18:19:00,8243,"Thanks Grimsby, that is clear. You can't use too much (sell more Sea Foam), so 1 can in the full tank should be fine and a splash in the kicker tank. I was wary of using too much.  Many Marine Gurus on iboats forums think it is a marketing scam, not just Sea Foam, all the tune ups in a can. I don't know. I have never used it in the 8 years I have had the engine. They say it can't hurt, like a placebo. I have a few cans I picked up on sale last season so I'll use it.  Do you guys find any difference at all or is it for peace of mind?"
1005464,Woodsman,2017-06-05 18:23:00,1286,"Yes it has smoothed out many engines for me including boat motors, chain saws & lawn mowers. Works on both 2 & 4 strokes."
1005467,Old Ironmaker,2017-06-05 18:32:00,8243,"Good to know Woodsman, thank you."

I have never used it in the 8 years I have had the engine. Do you guys find any difference at all or is it for peace of mind?  Well, I didn't use the gas power washer last year, so it had half a tank of 2 year old gas with Seafoam treatment in it. I know it is not truly a stabilizer but I topped it up with fresh Seafoamed gas and started on the second pull and powerwashed all the house siding   Not recommending this a standard practice but I think it played a big part of me lucking out on not having to get into a carb cleaning or big repair bill."
1005513,Wheels,2017-06-05 23:50:00,28,Yes
1005518,Old Ironmaker,2017-06-05 23:54:00,8243,The Sea Foam went in today before I forgot. If we get anymore rain and the lake gets any higher I won't have to launch the boat to cast to the fish.
1005533,mike rousseau,2017-06-06 00:16:00,4661,Thanks for the heads up
1005897,moxie,2017-06-10 00:39:00,1566,Use it everywhere. Havent winterized my boat as well as other small engines  in years
