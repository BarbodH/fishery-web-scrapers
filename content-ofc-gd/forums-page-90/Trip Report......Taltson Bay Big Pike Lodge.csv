873257,NewHips,2014-09-19 22:59:00,111,"Wow, incredible stuff! I believe you'd be hard-pressed to find a better pike fishery anywhere in the world based on this report. Did you spend any time targetting other species? Well, they do offer a Lake Trout trip, which I believe is pretty far from camp. I tried for some Walleye, but was the only one in camp to get any (3). What was surprising is that the walleye weren't in the river. Although most people really don't fish for them, one of the guides said he had never caught any near the rapids. Maybe just a spring time spot?"
873273,Joey,2014-09-20 01:27:00,9122,All i can say is wow.   Super photos.  What a great trip!
873470,chris.brock,2014-09-21 23:40:00,4053,"A lot of effort to get there, and likely a few dollars too, but those giants are definitely worth it, awesome fishery and part of the country, thanks for the report"
873485,moxie,2014-09-22 02:33:00,1566,No doubt a Trip of a Lifetime. Thanks for sharing. Really enjoyed that.
873487,Burtess,2014-09-22 02:45:00,901,"Holly crap!!!!  What a trip and report, absolutely fantastic!  Burt"
873580,NewHips,2014-09-22 18:42:00,111,"Thanks, everyone................this trip will be hard to top, that's for sure. I'm in the process of adding my 3 day trip report from Hearne Lake, not quite as exciting as this one."
873634,scuro2,2014-09-23 00:30:00,904,"...may be so...include lots of pics and detail, any far north fishing really interests me."
873675,Hank Jr,2014-09-23 11:59:00,146,Nice fish loved the pictures . Thanks for sharing
874217,lunkerbasshunter,2014-09-26 23:44:00,2585,omg wow
1005846,Moosebunk,2017-06-09 12:22:00,3970,Resurrected!!!  Because it was only just found for the first time.  Awesome read.  That'll get the pike slime juices flowing.
1005852,mistaredone,2017-06-09 15:45:00,913,Incredible!!!
1005853,BillM,2017-06-09 15:54:00,17367,I need to fish here.
1005856,grimsbylander,2017-06-09 16:30:00,3016,"Great report, great pictures and fantastic fish! Congrats on a successful trip and thank you for sharing!"
1005858,Old Ironmaker,2017-06-09 17:17:00,8243,"Unbelievable. I believe it so I should say simply amazing. For some reason I don't remember reading this report 3 years back, I would have remembered for sure. That has to be the most productive Pike fishing I have ever heard of f\rom anywhere in my almost 40 years of fishing for them beasts. And I thought we hammered the Pike in the Long Lac area years back, nothing like those numbers and size. The accommodations, scenery and Northern Lights would be worth the trip, world class fishing a major bonus.  Thanks to the OP for giving it and thanks to Mr. Moosebunk for bumping it. Man my bucket list is getting long."
1005873,DRIFTER_016,2017-06-09 21:01:00,10439,Missed this post originally as I was crushing chrome in Alaska. Too bad I wasn't in town. Coulda had a drink or two. Taltson is a wicked fishery. They also have good trout over there and there are big Inconnu caught every year.
1006410,lunkerbasshunter,2017-06-14 03:59:00,2585,wow that is like a dream trip amazing  Cheers
1006480,Rich Clemens,2017-06-14 22:49:00,3131,One awesome report.  The trip of a lifetime.    Thank You for taking the time to put this together.
1006487,aplumma,2017-06-14 23:36:00,6896,Thank you for taking the time to write the report it was an excellent trip and I am envious of your good times with your son.   Art
1006498,bobowski,2017-06-15 01:37:00,360,Wow. That's an amazing trip. I don't know if I could ever go there because when you get back home and fish your home waters it would be a joke compared to that.
1006579,wantabigone,2017-06-15 18:11:00,97,Fantastic report-thanks for posting (and for moosebunk to resurrect). This area is on my bucket list-likely will not happen for another 7 years.  What week did you go to the lodge?
1006641,moxie,2017-06-16 02:23:00,1566,"Anglers ""Heaven on Earth"" . Wow !! Great report. Thanks for sharing."
872882,NewHips,2014-09-17 03:20:00,111,"After some research on my part, I finally had it narrowed down to Taltson Bay Big Pike Lodge or Lac La Martre both out of Yellowknife Northwest Territories. After talking to various people from fishing forums, I choose Taltson Bay. Flying out of Knoxville TN. Stopping in Chicago, Calgary…….Yellowknife, 2600 miles total one way. I was meeting my oldest boy, who lives in Honolulu a couple days early, as these were the only days he could use his frequent flyer miles. The Northwest Territories had had its worst fire season in over 30 years, Since early June and the beginning of the Northwest Territories fire season, there have been 333 fires that have burned over 2.8 million hectares of land (6,918,950 acres). By the time we arrived the smoke had cleared, we talked to a local that said one day he couldn’t see more than 20 feet, the air quality index was off the chart.Yellowknife, and the adjacent river and bay on Great Slave Lake, derive their names from the knives once used by Dene of the area. The blades were fashioned from naturally occurringcopper gathered along the northern reaches of the also aptlynamed Coppermine River, near the Arctic coast. Now diamond mines are their main resource.Day 1 Landing in YellowknifeThere were plenty of cabs around, we were staying at the Bayside Bed and Breakfast which is located in Old Town, in sight of Air Tindi the float plane base. Ate at the Dancing Moose Cafe, arctic char burger,fries and wine.My son got in after 10pm, early bed.Day 2Not much to do in Yellowknife, but did some last minute shopping, rested up and set the alarm for 11:30pm to see if the Northern Lights were out. They were, as Yellowknife sits under the Aurora Band.Not to bad for my first attempt, this was in the backyard of the BB.Day 3Had a nice day, we walked up to Pilots Monument which overlooks the Back Bay of Great Slave Lake.For supper we went to Bullocks' Bistro, had the Kingfisher Sampler, pricey but worth every penny. Really had a fun time, the cook looks she came out of the 60's and pics of the Caribou head and goofy hats & chainsaw. (sorry no pics). My son had the Bison Steak, excellent as well. With a couple drinks each our bill was $120. I would do it again if I had the chance.Stayed up to midnight, but the Aurora was weak.Day 4Our flight scheduled for 11:00am was right on time. Joining us were 5 others in one group, so 7 total in camp. We flew Air Tindi,Flew in a Caravan, seats about 12, I believe they said it costs 3 million, really a nice plane. Flight took about 45 minutes.That's the camp, sits at the end of the Taltson River where it flows into Great Slave Lake. It didn't take long to unpack and get out fishing. Within the first couple hours we had already popped 6 Pike over 40 inches, many fish in the 35-39 inch range.Best for the day a 44 inch. 40 fish total, very aggressive and hard fighters.Day 5Cloudy and rainy most of the day, sun came out when we were eating lunch. I swear the entire week the wind would change directions every 2 hours. I had discovered the cabbage was starting to die off, a lot of the fish were out in the sand flats, maybe 200 yards or so from the weeds. I had my GPS so every time we got a big fish I put in a way-point.  This pattern held up all week, I believe they were following the whitefish, so I had my milk run every day, without the GPS this was impossible. We could cast troll or drift, whatever we felt like. Big spinner baits were the ticket, Grinders, and some homemade (Rips Lures) on Ebay worked great.Buchertails, savage gear/ big plastics were excellent.One day I used a giant flatfish Crome/Chart. that was literally destroyed in 2 days. One fish tore my Savage Gear hard body in half. Big baits are the ticket up there, leave your #5 mepps at home. Double 8's and double 10's spinnerbaits always drew them in. Wait to hear about the night bite !!!!! For the day we got 9 over 40 inches with a 44.5 the biggest.   http://youtu.be/HgBo3C4zkk4  Day 6 Another cloudy rainy day, fishing was great, hits or fish most every cast, many doubles as well. 7 big fish in the morning with a 43 inch, 2- 41 inch in the afternoon and a 45 inch at night. Their is a after supper bite that occurs in the channel (about a quarter mile long) about 10 foot of water. Most of the guys use big Bulldawgs, I mean the magnum size, 14-16 inches long.I only had one big one with me and a couple of smaller ones (12 inches). You troll the channel until past dark. In one night one guy in camp had 9 fish over 40 inches. My son used a big Believer that brought in quite a few. Best day of fishing I have ever had.      Clear skies tonight.....the Northern Lights will be out.                 Quite a day to say the least. Day 7 Morning started off cloudy and looked like rain, the camp decided to head up the Taltson River to the Falls, a 27 mile journey. My son and weren't guided, we didn't have to go........but why not. I knew if we didn't we would be sorry.     We raised numerous big Pike to no avail...........I did manage a beautiful marked fish as we were heading back.    One guy in the group got at least 4 big ones using a Shadalicus with a 3/8 oz jighead.      For the day only a few fish caught, but 4 big ones,    The Northern Lights were out again.........      Day 8 Warm and wind died down, morning bite was good, 40 fish with 2-41 inch fish          For the day we got 60 fish, 9 big fish with a 47 inch at night.This one night the camp had a 49...48...2=47.....3=44...and quite a few aver 40. All I can say is WOW.        http://youtu.be/poN1v7_opY0  http://youtu.be/BeR5jU_K2F4    http://youtu.be/6xQYVPg-BS8  Day 9 Wind and cold all day 30 mph from the N/W.....big waves total loss of the day. 5 fish for the day with 2 over 40 inches.  http://youtu.be/R6J4VxRjehw  Day 10 Last fishing day.......I was in the Zone, for the day 75-100 fish....... 15 fish over 40 inches 3=45 in. best day ever in my fishing life. Longest drought was 15 minutes, many doubles. My Savage Gear was on fire today along with my Flatfish. The night bite was incredible, you couldn't land them fast enough. Using 2 giant Bulldawgs we boated 8 huge fish before 8:00pm. I had a monster boat side that was huge, estimating 48-50 inches, it literally broke my fish gripper in two pieces with a head spin. We had her unhooked and was ready to grip her when she broke free. A thunderstorm moved in, with hail as we headed back to camp..........What an experience!!!!!!!!!!!! We lost at least 2 hours of night bite, easily 3-4 more big fish to be had.                   Day 11 Time to pack up and say goodbye. Cloudy and cold, some sleet. Plane was arriving at 10am.                   What a trip.................cross one off my Bucket-list. If you want Big Pike this is the place, feel free to contact me for specific information. Thanks for watching..................New Hips          "
