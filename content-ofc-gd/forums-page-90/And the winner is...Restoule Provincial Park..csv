1005587,RAO,2017-06-06 14:26:00,13,"A couple of weeks ago I created a post about where to camp with my wife and young boys.  After looking at your replies and doing some research I have settled on Restoule Provincial Park.  The idea is to do a bit of everything. Fishing, boating, biking and swimming.  Any pointers on how to fish Restoule or Stormy and the connecting lakes?  Not looking for specific spots just something to point me in the right direction.  Also does any one know how the bike trails are there.  Thanks  RAO"

1005742,Dan668,2017-06-07 17:55:00,1120,"One of my favourite parks. Great fishing in any of the lakes. Haven't been in two years, last time I went found Muskies left on shore on the river. Was pretty pissed. What are you looking to fish for?"

1005801,RAO,2017-06-08 15:43:00,13,"Dan668,  I have two young boys 10 and 12 who both like fishing.  I am targeting anything that bites ie pike bass walleye.  I am also thinking of spending my fishing time on the Stormy lake side.  I will also be trailering a 14' aluminum boat."
1005802,Dutch01,2017-06-08 16:13:00,1431,"Fyi guys, I'm pretty sure Stormy has a 20hp limit."
1005807,Dan668,2017-06-08 19:55:00,1120,"Yes there's a limit now, it's too bad. That's why I haven't been back even though its one my favorite places to fish"
