1005571,scugpg,2017-06-06 11:25:00,1373,I need to ship a rod cross province and was wondering what the easiest way to do so is. Was thinking of some plastic tubing from a hardware store with caps on it with the rod wrapped in cloth inside. It's quite long at 9ft so not sure which carriers will handle this too. Hoping some have experience on here to share.  Thanks
1005572,FloatnFly,2017-06-06 11:45:00,1640,ask spiel how he ships his rods
1005574,DanD,2017-06-06 11:57:00,2223,"I make a rod case out of 3"" PVC pipe; one end cap and one threaded cap; that I got at home depot. Glued it together put the rod(s) in and then dumped a bunch of shipping popcorn into the tube. Had Purolator courier it for me to my destination. Made it out of PVC rather then cardboard tubing, for the fact I didn't know how rough the purolator handlers were going to be.  Dan."
1005577,AKRISONER,2017-06-06 12:45:00,5558,PVC pipe all the way.  Been hauling rods around like this for years
1005581,BillM,2017-06-06 13:03:00,17367,"Yup, PVC is the way to go."
1005582,SirCranksalot,2017-06-06 13:19:00,3291,"Yup---ABS works too!  I have used PVC for years when travelling---travelling up N with a bunch of everyone's gear piled in the vehicle or boat, even on planes(about the only thing an airline can't damage. (For getting run over by a forklift ABS is prob better!  )p"
1005588,scugpg,2017-06-06 14:35:00,1373,That's great folks I'll go the Pvc route. Thank you!
1005605,Spiel,2017-06-06 16:30:00,9065,"Yes, PVC and bubble wrap around the rods at either end (taped in place) to keep it centered in the tube.Funny enough I did get a shipment of blanks once (PVC) with forklift tire marks across it, every blank inside destroyed including an irreplaceable blank from Batson as it was the last one they had of an older model. Ya, I was pissed."

1005665,Tom S,2017-06-07 00:37:00,362,"PVC with test caps on the ends, and rod wrapped up securely and the ends cushioned so the rod can't knock around. Not going to be cheap at that length.  I was told last time I dropped one off at the post office that they do tack an extra charge on for round items and tubes, as they tend to roll off the conveyor belts and cause extra work. I was going to look into finding a triangular mailing tube to go around the PVC next time to see if I could save that charge."
1005697,DanD,2017-06-07 10:45:00,2223,"Not going to be cheap at that length.   Home depot  3"" X 10' is $17.22.  https://www.homedepot.ca/en/home/p.pvc-3-inches-x-10-ft-solid-sewer-pipe---ecolotubesupsup.1000659635.html  Dan."

I meant the shipping. I've done a couple rods in 60"" tubes, they ended up being about $50 to ship to the states. 102"" + is not going to be a cheap shipment."
1005730,Spiel,2017-06-07 16:09:00,9065,"Like I said, should have used ABS!  But it was shipped to me, not from me.  $55.00 to ship a 58"" tube this past Monday from Hamilton To Brooklyn, NY."
1005737,DRIFTER_016,2017-06-07 17:18:00,10439,At 9' I'm pretty sure it will have to go courier as I don't believe Cpost handles items that long.

Look around at tackle swaps or yard sales, Fenwick at one time used a plastic triangular tube for their rods, bought a few from Greeny when he had the rod business in Mt. Hope."
1005752,Old Ironmaker,2017-06-07 20:00:00,8243,"I have an expandable rod holder I bought from The Outdoor Store, it's that old and shipped it a few times with both Fed Ex and Canada Post. Also shipped golf clubs to Florida. Cheaper then paying the extra weight on a charter airline."
1005754,Bill Shearer,2017-06-07 20:33:00,456,"I've shipped rods to Alaska and BC as part of extra sports baggage a few times in a 4"" ABS rod tube. Not had any issues. I padded rods with bubble wrap for extra insurance. If the baggage handlers wanted to ruin your day no amount of packing and tube strength will matter.  Years ago on a direct Air Canada flight from Montreal to Vancouver, a baggage truck managed to smash 4 rods in a ABS tube. We could see the tire marks on the tube. Apologies were not offered, and pursuit of damages was a waste of time."
1005781,scugpg,2017-06-08 01:39:00,1373,Yeah some initial quotes from sw to nw Ontario is looking around 60-70 not including piping.....
1005785,buick14,2017-06-08 02:02:00,741,"Absolute pain. Shipping prices in Canada vs USA is obscene. I think I used to ship UPS , but it's been a while.A strong schedule 40 abs is durable as hell , but costs more (a lot more). Lol forklifts are heavy, have short wheel bases, and weight displacement/transfer is different then an automobile that is equiped with shocks and tires! lol so I can't say it will withstand that, but you can definitely drive a sedan over it!As stated by spiel and others-pack the but and tip with bubble wrap , and in a few other places throughout the length of the rod. You want it to have no movement up or down/side to side , aside from what the bubble wrap affords, BUDD."

The AC agent warned me that they were not responsible for damage in those 'non-standard' containers. I was tempted to say that I was using those containers so even AC couldn't damage them. I guess I was wrong.  When I was working we had a big honkin chunk of metal(with some moving parts)  shipped back to us from a test facility in the US. Some cowboy forklift driver in the Atlanta managed to drive into it---- presumably at a good speed as the quite sturdy wood crate was smashed to bits!"
1005821,KraTToR,2017-06-09 00:44:00,506,"May be cheaper just to use cardboard and pay for the insurance.  I've received several rods from the US in cardboard boxes w/o any packing. They arrived fine. I've also had a golf club shipped that way and it was destroyed. Graphite shaft..lol  Its its going to get run over, not much will protect it."
1005871,aplumma,2017-06-09 20:28:00,6896,There are two grades of PVC available to customers one is schedule 40 ridgid PVC VS schedule 40 foamcore. PVC. The foamcore has not for pressure written on the outside and is cheaper. Foamcore is easier to damage and you will find it is cheaper if they have both types. The ability to crush of PVC and ABS is about the same in fact ABS is not easily found in the US nowadays. The use of a FIP fitting with a plug on both ends will make it stronger and easier to get the rods in and out.   Art
