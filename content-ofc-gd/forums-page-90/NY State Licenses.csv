As an non-resident it costs $50 per year for the freshwater fishing license and I get to pick my effective date! So this year, my license is good from today until next year June 6, 2018. You always get your full years money's worth as opposed to it expiring on December 31th regardless of when you buy it. Nice. For residents it's even better, they can buy a lifetime license for $460 for anyone between the ages of 1-69 years old. Wish they had this here 30 years ago. They can then get a symbol added to their drivers license so they don't have to carry a separate fishing licence. This includes hunting licenses too.  Small things but very progressive!"

1005727,porkpie,2017-06-07 15:55:00,2521,Valid from date of purchase is a new thing in the last couple years.  The $20 reduction is pretty cool also!  Not to often you see prices going down!
1005808,SuperDave,2017-06-08 20:02:00,204,I usually call the DEC in April to renew. The service is professional and they usually have it mailed to me within a week. And no stupid outdoors card needed. Just a license.
1005809,Bill Shearer,2017-06-08 20:11:00,456,Lesssons to be learned by Kathleen and her money hungry crew!
