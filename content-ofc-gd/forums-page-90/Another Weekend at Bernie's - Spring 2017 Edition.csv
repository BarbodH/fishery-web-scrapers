1005553,ccmtcanada,2017-06-06 02:25:00,7971,"Three times a year, a group of us is lucky to be invited up to Bernie's paradise up on Lake Nipissing.  Why he keeps inviting us back, I have no idea....but I'm sure glad he does!  This trips cast of characters included Headhunter (Joe), Fishnsled (Will), Rubin and myself.  Will, Joe and Rubin arrived at my place at 640am Friday morning and we started our trek north.  We knew the weather wasn't going be great on Sunday, but we were hoping to spend some time on the water on Friday and Saturday.  Our trip was up was unevenful, and we arrived at the island around 1030am.  After some quick conversation to catch up since we were all together last, some sandwiches for lunch, we decided to hit the water in search of some walleye or pike.        We got back to the cottage around 530-6pm and had a jerk pork roast....courtesy of Joe!  We are truly blessed with great food while we are up there.  You might say saying ""bless you"" was a common occurrence, much to the chagrin of Rubin....  We went back out after dinner to see what we could find...caught a lot of small walleye, but one time I pulled up this BLUE perch!  It was very odd....but pretty cool to see    Me and this little guy admiring the sunset view!!!     We headed back in at sunset and relaxed and chatted the evening away....we were all pretty tired from the early start we had that morning!!  Saturday morning came, and for once we actually made it out on the water before noon!! LOL.  It was a little chilly, but the bite was on....couldn't quite catch a keeper, but we had a few that were very close.             If you look really really closely at this picture....enlarge it about to about 10x magnification, you can see that Joe caught a fish!  At least we think it was a fish....   We headed in around noon for lunch.  Will was going to barbecue some home made burgers....and by then we were all pretty hungry!  First, the grill, which hadn't been used in about a year, needed cleaned up a bit.  I asked Bernie if he had a scraper.  He said ""Of course I do"", then proceeded to pick up his garden rake....    After lunch (probably 2/3 pound burgers), we headed back out and fished until the sun went down.  Here's a few pics....         Then, Will brought all the fun to a stop.  After bringing a walleye into the boat, it thrashed all around and did this....   A quick snip with the cutters, and Will was fishing again in about 5 minutes  We stayed out til it got dark again...   That was the end of our fishing....we watched a few Jays games, watched Nashville beat Pittsburgh, and even found time to watch a few movies.  Sunday was an iffy day weather wise....so we had some lunch and hit the road!  Another chapter of the Weekend at Bernie's chapter has closed.  Great company, great friends, great food, great time fishing....cant beat it!  Bless you guys....these weekends are needed to keep sane in today's world!"

1005844,dave524,2017-06-09 11:47:00,4508,"Crushed aluminum foil works quite well.  Put the grates on the steel bed of the landscape trailer  and hit them with the 3200 psi gas power washer, re-oiled the cast iron and good to go. Thanks for the tip on the foil, it should work in between, wife is pretty anal about clean grates, me , not so much"
