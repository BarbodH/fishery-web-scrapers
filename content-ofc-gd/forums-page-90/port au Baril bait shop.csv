1005705,Cast-Away,2017-06-07 12:50:00,790,If not there is Huronia Bait in Fesserton right off of the 400 south of Waubaushene.
1005723,Cosmos,2017-06-07 15:22:00,588,"If not there is Huronia Bait in Fesserton right off of the 400 south of Waubaushene. Thank you, its another option for sure."
1005724,Headhunter,2017-06-07 15:26:00,5703,"There's a bait shop on 69, just north of the hwy 69 bridge over the French. If I recall correctly, just past the Hartley Bay road, on the east side of the hwy. Sorry, can't recall the name of the store. It's in the basement of the owners home. I also think that the store at the Key River and 69 sells bait. HH"
1005725,Lord Letto,2017-06-07 15:37:00,70,"Not sure, but maybe the French River Trading Post or one of the Lodges in the area got some to sell, I'd call around to ask. Good Luck on the Trip."
1005728,Raf,2017-06-07 15:58:00,3495,"you are going to get gouged anywhere you stop at that corner.  if it's your only choice, it's your only choice but i'd look at other options mentioned already"
1005731,zenon11,2017-06-07 16:22:00,75,"I drove by last week around 11pm. It was closed, but the lights were. I'm betting it's open."
1005732,Musky Plug,2017-06-07 16:26:00,398,"Yes, he should be open. Can always call the shell gas station they might be able to help. Or like mentioned before call around to local places in the area you're going, they might be able to help as well. Good luck!"
1005738,OhioFisherman,2017-06-07 17:33:00,6623,"http://www.baitnet.com/search.php   There also used to be a bait store right in Parry Sound?  TAYLOR'S ICE & BAIT (705) 746-5495  Too many years ago for me, that might be the place?"
1005748,tizfun,2017-06-07 18:45:00,292,Yes...  Drove by there last Monday afternoon on my way home from Sudbury and it was open...  He's a little pricey.. but his bait has always been very good.. Good luck...
1005750,Cosmos,2017-06-07 18:56:00,588,Thank you guys.
1005751,Freshtrax,2017-06-07 19:55:00,2215,Also one on the highway near the native rez. On  the way to the French across from lcbo. Nice old lady In there she must be 90.  She is funny when she catches giant sucker minnows from tank with bear hands.
1005753,SmokestackLightnin,2017-06-07 20:02:00,390,"you are going to get gouged anywhere you stop at that corner. if it's your only choice, it's your only choice but i'd look at other options mentioned already  Isn't that the truth.  We now stop at the Magnetewan First Nations, there is a new Esso and Tim Hortons.  Even the price of gas at the shell is 10 to 15 cents a litre higher then Shawanaga, Magnetewan and the Parry Sound Service Centre."
