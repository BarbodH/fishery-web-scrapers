I can't get out of the city for a few weeks to fish other waters, but am itching to at least fish for something so the piers are my best bet.  Given that bass season is closed for now, is there anything else that I can catch off the piers with a worm and hook?  I know piers like port maitland, there are a variety fish (walleye, perch, catfish,sheephead and the list goes on), but as far as I know lake Ontario piers are only known for the usual salmon,steelhead and of course carp.  I did remember seeing someone catch silver fish (probably silver bass or white perch) on a spoon, but that was a rare sight.  Any insight would be appreciated. Basically just want to relax and fish without suspicion that I am targetting bass. Maybe I have to get into carp fishing lol.  if only they can open bass season earlier by a few weeks .  they are all over the place!  Thanks"

1005780,buick14,2017-06-08 01:35:00,741,"Take your worm and fish.  If you are in an area where you see bass redds, leave and move on. There are tons of opportunities for in season fish in lake o while casting an earthworm that don't involve OOS species.  There are way more species eager to hit that are in season vs OOS.  Fish my friend, but be respectful of our resources."
