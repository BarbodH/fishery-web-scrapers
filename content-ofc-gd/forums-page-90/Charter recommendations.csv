1005927,b_cdot,2017-06-10 04:00:00,270,I live in the chatham kent area and have fished steelies in erie. I want to turn it up a notch and get a group together for the big O. Looking for a good charter out of the GTA for some big kings and also some suggestions on time to book. Thanks
1005929,Old Ironmaker,2017-06-10 04:07:00,8243,"Look at Fish Masters, a member here and a great record of guiding. If no fish he will give a great rate for a second trip. The days of guaranteed fish are long gone. He goes out of St. Catherines this time of year. Then Erie for our monster Walleye latter in the summer I believe."
1005931,Freshtrax,2017-06-10 04:30:00,2215, niagarafishingservices.com  Mr Rohr has my vote.   Got me hooked on kings a few years back.    But if it's solely big kings look out of buffers or Whitby in July August.
1005932,b_cdot,2017-06-10 04:34:00,270,We get our fill of big walleyes this way. Looking for a chance at some kings.

1005977,GBW,2017-06-10 17:18:00,8460,Can always look at Lloyd from U & ME Guide Service.  He has a FB page and posted here may a time too.  His posts are not of charter days when he posts but his own fun days with the boys when he was posting here.
1006000,bow slayer,2017-06-10 19:24:00,1074,"Lower lake Huron has some great salmon fishing and is a lot closer to you,may not have the numbers or size of Lake ontario but some good fishing none the less."
1006017,Freshtrax,2017-06-10 23:37:00,2215,Can't even compare the two fisheries.  Night and day in my opinion.
1006022,b_cdot,2017-06-11 00:40:00,270,"That is also an option, if you have any recommendations for a Huron charter id consider it. Thanks"
