1048536,Out4Trout,2019-08-19 15:43:00,98,I got her stopped on the amber before the white line... 
1048537,glen,2019-08-19 15:46:00,2641,Ya but the boats over the line so you still get a ticket. Makes you wonder what was holding it on the trailer
1048539,Cast-Away,2019-08-19 17:46:00,790,"The Dodge got ""RAMMED""!"
1048551,Old Ironmaker,2019-08-19 19:50:00,8243,"Cheap tie down ratchet straps rated for a few hundred pounds from Princess Auto. I see it all the time and just shake my head. When I had a slip at the marina I would see guys with cheap straps used as tie downs all the time. I mentioned it to a few guys, some were thankful but most basically told me to mind my own business of which I now do. I've even seen ropes with nice little knots in them. Some boats didn't even have that. Oh that's what those  things are for?"
1048552,misfish,2019-08-19 20:16:00,29133,"Something not right. Trailer has bunks, No skid marks from the truck tires, so that tells me no high speed sudden stop. If it was on rollers, ya ok maybe. Also you cant hurt a Ram like that. Ford ya, I can see it. LOL "
1048561,DRIFTER_016,2019-08-20 00:37:00,10439,Dental floss would be my guess. ??
1048562,BillM,2019-08-20 01:26:00,17367,"I'm guessing the boat was hit from behind and launched over the truck,   No way that was from a hard stop."
1048563,dave524,2019-08-20 01:28:00,4508,Actually the boat isn't over the line  https://fingerlakes1.com/2018/07/22/pickup-truck-crushed-by-boat-after-it-comes-free-from-trailer-on-sr-104/  edit: few more pics and info  PS. I'm obviously retired and have too much time on my hands LOL    https://www.motor1.com/news/258331/boat-smashes-truck-towing-it/ https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=10155699867558008&id=42557798007 
1048564,BillM,2019-08-20 01:52:00,17367,"I would have LOVED to see this in person, lol!"
1048574,singingdog,2019-08-20 11:26:00,1047,The flimsy aluminum ladder on the stern look perfectly intact. I don't think the boat was hit from behind.
1048578,Terry,2019-08-20 12:22:00,14456,"if you look at all the photos and the size of the boat , I think the ram held up pretty well, I wonder how one of those aluminum made trucks that a tool boxes rip holes in  them would have stood up"
1048616,NAW,2019-08-20 21:01:00,4022,looks like he just used the mooring ropes to tie the boat to the trailer.  Not sure what those ropes are rated for.
1048617,Big Cliff,2019-08-20 22:31:00,6899,Just couldn't wait his turn at the ramp?
