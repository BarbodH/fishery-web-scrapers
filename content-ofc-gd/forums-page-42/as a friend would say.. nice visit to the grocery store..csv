1048284,OhioFisherman,2019-08-10 15:17:00,6623,"Keep in mind I haven't fished in years, during the early 80's you could troll, or cast baits like Erie Dearies, nuggets or even Rattle Trap style lures. I used to catch them throwing blade baits near the rocky areas of South Bass, Kelly's Island and the other western basin Islands. Finding them wasn't that hard back then even without great electronics, on this side all you had to do was look for the "" school "" of boats casting or trolling for them. They had a habit of suspending and we did a lot of long line trolling lures like wiggle warts and hot n tots for them, the smaller ones were kind of like logs, once they got over 4# or so a better fight! LOL almost like a sheephead! Lake Erie walleye on the move, but trophy fish still being caught: Aug. 9 Fishing Report - cleveland.com"
1048285,OhioFisherman,2019-08-10 15:22:00,6623,Now if they would stop commercial netting of Perch the numbers might bounce back?
1048333,J Roelofsen,2019-08-12 07:52:00,84,With the Walleye numbers absolutely exploding the perch are scattered and changing their habits. I've heard stories of them suspending much higher in the water column. The commercial netting doesn't help but I wouldnt expect any big increase in perch numbers with them being on the menu of the massive Walleye population. And those Walleye numbers aren't dropping anytime soon! Heard a story the other day that it's looking like the 2019 Walleye hatch is likely going to put the massive 2018 hatch to shame ? Josh
1048156,Freshtrax,2019-08-07 00:26:00,2215,"My first time out on erie for eyes ever.  Had my dad ( bit of a meat hunter lol) and my brother with me . we got em patterned pretty quick,  a few went back , most went in the cooler. Bigest of the day was 27.5 and 8 lb  not bad for 4 hours in the afternoon on a bluebird day     "
1048157,BillM,2019-08-07 00:30:00,17367,Nice!  If it wasn't such a haul I'd bring the oldman down there.  Action on Erie this year has been incredible from what I've been hearing.
1048158,muskybw,2019-08-07 00:41:00,116,"nice wally & stringer of eyes ! i have a friend out of STANLEY, the wally fishing this summer is incredible, so he says.  ps. i have eaten 3 feeds of them, with my miss vicky malt vinegar recipe."
1048159,Freshtrax,2019-08-07 00:42:00,2215,It was a gong show   couldent keep lines in the water.    Like i said ive never been before only fished erie for bass but it was a riot. lines down at 1:30 and back to kitchener and fish cleaned before the sun set.
1048160,chris.brock,2019-08-07 00:46:00,4053,"I bet you guys will be back, and pretty soon, lol, that's a beauty haul"
1048162,Rizzo,2019-08-07 01:06:00,4754,wow what a mess of fish. My understanding is the last couple years have been fire out there for eyes. You proved it
1048165,bigugli,2019-08-07 01:27:00,6138,Erie has been fantastic. Good to see you had a great afternoon.
1048174,Rod Caster,2019-08-07 02:31:00,5784,Nice stringer! Looks like a Nipissing photo from the 70s.
1048181,misfish,2019-08-07 10:07:00,29133,"Nice fish and no disrespect Andrew when I say,  the on fire thing will be done if this is done by all anglers out there. Reminds me of pictures back in the 40,s and 50,s. Hey,it,s your right."
1048184,DanD,2019-08-07 10:29:00,2223,"Angler with sport license 6 walleye in your possession. Commercial fisher with nets full on a daily routine, until quota is met and that's only if they're not doctoring their books. Sorry man; but who's doing the damage to the fishery? Dan.  "
1048186,misfish,2019-08-07 10:54:00,29133,"Forgot they commercial fish out there, so I guess take what ya can when ya can."
1048187,Freshtrax,2019-08-07 11:00:00,2215,I hear ya.. i almost didntt post that  pic.  for this reason.   like dan said below theres multipal comercial boats out of most ports in canada on erie literaly netting tons of fish daily for your local sobys We Went one time and caught a limit.  I dont feel the least bit guilty apart for the one  lager fish that wouldent revive.  If this was an inland lake completely different story.  I dont understand how theres so many fish with so much pressure but there is actualy talk of increasing limits for recreational fisherman in the future.
1048189,Rod Caster,2019-08-07 12:12:00,5784,"Obviously you are a mindful fisherman. If the fish #'s were at risk the keep limits would either drop prior, or immediately after; the MNR has some pretty good levers for managing our fisheries. All decent fishermen are aware of the risks of keeping/injuring too many fish... the problem 'back in the day', just like the olde market-hunting years that almost wiped out ALL of our wildlife, was that people thought that the resources were unlimited (the bison will eventually come down from Canada they said!), plus there was no real oversight. All that to say, good luck tomorrow and the day after and the day after... PM me the back to back to back to back drooping string of fish with more and more family members involved, followed by pictures of frost-burned bags of fish"
1048191,J Roelofsen,2019-08-07 12:38:00,84,"Ohio was smart enough to realize the value of the sport fishery and banish the commercial industry. Guess where Ontario sends a majority of the commercial catch now!?.....yup, right across the border to our neighboring great lakes states. Stupid. Theres plenty of fish out there for everyone right now but if history holds true they'll continue to raise commercial quotas until its too late, the fishery will crash and we'll be waiting for a miracle spawn for the fishery to recover like it thankfully has the past couple seasons. The outlook right now is very, very promising but I have little faith in the management of the resource. Josh"
1048192,misfish,2019-08-07 13:10:00,29133,Are you friggen joking here ? They do not have a handle on anything.
1048193,J Roelofsen,2019-08-07 13:17:00,84,Everyone that fishes Erie can take limits every time out and it will have little impact on the population. Estimates put the #'s at or above 130000000 walleye in the lake right now. And this springs spawn could easily ad another 50000000+ to that total. No amount of recreational fishing is gonna put a dent in those numbers. Josh
1048194,misfish,2019-08-07 13:31:00,29133,"That is crazy numbers. Thanks for posting this. I had no idea. Have atter then.  Simcoe does not get that close to any fish here. If anything,numbers are going down."
1048195,Reef Runner,2019-08-07 14:04:00,980,See nothing wrong with keeping your limit and staying within it; especially on Erie.  Nice haul!
1048203,porkpie,2019-08-07 16:44:00,2521,"Congrats, but be careful it’s addictive.  I’ve been dragging my boat down 2 plus hours each way every week for a few years now the fishing has been so good."
1048214,grimsbylander,2019-08-07 21:45:00,3016,"Congrats on a great day. I'd love a load of walleye too! The problem with the picture is simple and has ZERO to do with Freshtrax. Ethical people will stick to the limits and follow the rules. But...this is the internet, where idiots come to get their bright ideas. lol By Freshtrax just acknowledging his reluctance to post the pic tells you he's a stand up guy. Good on you! PS I think I really need to trade my bassboat for a walleye boat!! "
1048215,Freshtrax,2019-08-07 22:28:00,2215,i think im safe.  it was fun but it dosent scratch the itch like the big kings do for me.   the dipsie rips went quite as ferocious lol  
1048267,captpierre,2019-08-09 23:42:00,2521,Amazing. So it’s only a trolling thing on Erie? I hear they come in like logs Do they run in suspended schools or are they scattered on the bottom? Can you jig for them? ErieDearies?
1048268,Pikeslayer,2019-08-10 00:41:00,1443,The 50’s...... We need more stringer photos!!!
1048271,Freshtrax,2019-08-10 02:54:00,2215,"the bigger ones were fiestty.  i trued to run the lighest gear i could. ran spinning gear off the riggers.  but dipsies and leadcore we were just winching em in.    the bottom was  stacked like cordwood with fish but had to run the baits up about 20 ft to get bites.   this was my first time walleye fishing erie i just went into it  with an open mind ,  once we had a bite or two started feeding em what they wanted."
1048272,Freshtrax,2019-08-10 02:55:00,2215,"lol  Funny guy Sy.        the only reason dad wanted that photo was ""to get a photo like grandpas"""
