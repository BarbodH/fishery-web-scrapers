Guy is dead and the guess is cardiac arrest, haven't seen anything on the news yet. Sad to see stuff like that happen!"
1049042,Rizzo,2019-08-30 00:10:00,4754,yes...not every car going off the road is a drunk driver or distracted driver...equipment failures and medical emergencies can lead to some very serious consequences as well. My condolences to those affected
1049047,OhioFisherman,2019-08-30 00:52:00,6623,"Yes Rizzo! I guess the cab of the pickup truck was buried in the branches of the pine tree, no one even knew some one was inside until the police came. Lost a lot of friends and co workers over the years to sudden medical conditions. "
