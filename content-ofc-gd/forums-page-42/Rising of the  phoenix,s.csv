I am not sure the pic,s do it justice, but I could see the phoenix,s rising. If you look long enough, you will see the beak and wings. No I am not crazy nor do I puff the magic stuff.LOL        I had one chase in 3 hours moving about. 1 chase and 1 fish. Oh and YUP, left the inflatable behind again. Damit. This is why I have the foam jacket always on the toon with a whistle attached now. I knew I felt naked this morning while heading out.  I am always in a rush to get out there. Need to slow down ole man.    like I said, I only had 3 hours to float about to  fish  as I had pork to smoke,peppers to char for a friend. I,ll save that for the cooking thread.  "

1048545,Old Ironmaker,2019-08-19 19:25:00,8243,"On the 1st pic just left of the rods line above the horizon I see a Salmon jumping. The next 3 pics are wonderful. That cloud formation sure looks like a Tornado formation. I would have not taken the time to take it until I got me arse off the water. Fantastic photos Brian. There are hundreds of thousands, millions I should say smart phone users that never knew they had an eye for photography until the technology was available. In the old days you bought a roll of 36, took them, paid 50 cents or more to develop only to find 10 or more were duds. Today one can take 1000 pics and with a flick of a finger delete 999 basically for free. Now anyone can be a pro. Just ask my niece who is a pro photographer with 5 years of post secondary education for it under her belt. She does amazing work.  She gives tours at a Niagara Winery to pay the bills. 60 years ago professional photographers had to have a 1st job to survive, nothing has changed much."
