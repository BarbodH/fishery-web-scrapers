1048709,dave524,2019-08-23 12:10:00,4508,Miss that Handlebarz guy ?
1048716,Reef Runner,2019-08-23 14:00:00,980,All nice fish.  Have to get down there someday.
1048717,NAW,2019-08-23 14:04:00,4022,"Ahhh, the good old days before the locked elbow pose!  Great pics man!  Edit..  Not sure what spell check was doing on that one...."
1048727,Old Ironmaker,2019-08-23 18:29:00,8243,"Muhahhhaaa.Where you been man, new lady friend? That will keep you busy. There aren't any Musky left on LSC, zero, zip, ziltch. Don't bother going."
1048728,NAW,2019-08-23 19:05:00,4022,"I still lurk a lot.  But I have a new job, and I can't be on here all day at work like I used to be?"
1048731,Old Ironmaker,2019-08-23 20:24:00,8243,"I can't believe how many here post all day when they are supposed to be working (Terry, Brian). Ah man I digressed once again after saying I wouldn't just the other day to Art. I have deleted 95% of the post."
1048732,misfish,2019-08-23 20:35:00,29133,?
1048733,Old Ironmaker,2019-08-23 20:45:00,8243,"Nowhere as often as ManitouBass2. MB2, come in please, MB2 come in please, over. I found out through another member here he is OK then he texted me. He's fine. I was on a few other sites regularly and haven't posted there in years. I only got kicked off of 1, actually I kicked the proprietor out not he me."
1048738,Pigeontroller,2019-08-24 00:37:00,2793,I like to hold the smaller ones out sometimes for effect!    
1048739,Rizzo,2019-08-24 00:57:00,4754,I get out there a couple times a year....but figure people get bored of pictures of 36 inch muskies that seem to grace my boat out there! You got some real beauties though. I did go around a month ago. Fished around 6 hours and my buddy was bored so we left. Just a dirty pike for our efforts. That's a looong drive from Guelph for 6 hours fishing and one jack to show for it.
1048740,Pigeontroller,2019-08-24 01:43:00,2793, Its an even longer drive from St. Catharines!
1048742,Old Ironmaker,2019-08-24 02:26:00,8243,We put an offer on a place 15 minutes from Lake St. Clair. They wouldn't budge so no sale. I might never be home but I would only be 15 minutes from the shack.
1048750,lifeisfun,2019-08-24 12:10:00,99,What happened?
1048753,grimsbylander,2019-08-24 13:16:00,3016,All great looking fish there. St. Clair appears to be a very healthy musky factory so I hope it gets looked after. I know those musky have lots of 5 lb smallies to eat!! Lol Seriously considering making a move to a Ranger walleye boat...620 or 621. St. Clair musky would follow shortly afterwards. ?
1048761,porkpie,2019-08-24 13:58:00,2521,Your a bass guy aren’t you?  Do it do it do it do it ??
1048763,Old Ironmaker,2019-08-24 14:09:00,8243,"I don't care how big or small a fish is, it's a fish. A goby after 5 hours of hitting the water hurts though, I don't count them as a fish."
1048772,dave524,2019-08-24 16:01:00,4508,"In years gone by he was a frequent contributor here with lots of St.Clair musky pics, guess not enough time like Solopaddler. He is still around  https://www.handlebarzfishing.com/"
1048776,grimsbylander,2019-08-24 17:36:00,3016,Oh!!!! I was one more do it away from pulling the trigger!!! Lol ?
