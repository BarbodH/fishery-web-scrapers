Where can we chuck spoons this year??"
1048834,Old Ironmaker,2019-08-26 20:18:00,8243,I would presume it has to do with high water levels if there isn't any construction. I stopped at Pt. Maitland on Erie when it was extremely windy a few weeks ago because I saw the emergency guys hi tailing it that way towards Maitland. Anyone on that pier would have been blown off if they weren't tied down. I didn't hang around as there were no cars in the lot. The water was up 50' into the lot and no way to launch there with the 3' waves smashing on the ramp. They would have if they were sure someone was in peril. Look at long range forecasts not just when venturing out.

The piers at Port Dalhousie in St. Kitts are also closed due to active reconstruction I believe. Not my fish , but the Grimsby pier has produced some slob browns in the past "
1048838,Old Ironmaker,2019-08-26 21:21:00,8243,"Some good news out of the joint prov. and state Great Lakes commission. I know they have a big long name but I don't have the strength to recall it. I read on the weekend water levels are predicted to drop if the precipitation amounts this coming winter and spring hold true. I'm sure if I Google enough some scientific group monitoring water levels will have a different outlook. POTUS isn't wrong about everything he says. Who do you throw tax money after, those correct, those sometimes correct and those almost never correct?"
1048839,Old Ironmaker,2019-08-26 21:24:00,8243,Dave the only thing I am positive of in 84' was where we lived because I did the math and I turned 30 that year. My kid brother lives off of Lake St. He said Pt. Dalhousie is underwater. Only a few weeks ago they took the grand kids to the carousel. Only the little boats were above water.

As I said in another post high water has ruined all of the places I fish in spring/summer. Even impoundments like Montsberg are unfishable, not so much because of water levels but because the precipitation has washed fertalizer/cow poop into the water causing massive overgrowth of weeds. It basically sucks right now."
