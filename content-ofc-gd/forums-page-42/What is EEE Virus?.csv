For 3 days they are talking about this illness EEE.  that has required hospitalization and in some cases has caused death in humans and has killed a horse in the Boston area. Never defined the acronym for the decease nor the bug it is transferred by. Tic's, mosquito's what? Terrible journalism. W5, who, what, when, where, why. Grade 9 journalism."

Guess it reared it's head again. Edit: SVS, oldtimers acting up had it confused with West Nile well maybe they are quite similar, O.I. here is what your local goobermint has on the subject  https://hnhu.org/health-topic/eastern-equine-encephalitis-eee/"

Another thing to google, West Nile, everyone knows West Nile. The millennials and gen Xers are speaking to us as they speak everyday. In acronyms. LOL, ROTFLMAO. Or L2M. Laughing to myself, that's one I made up myself today. Or MUM2D."
