1043987,captpierre,2019-05-04 15:38:00,2521,Posted last year my 2007 trolling motor would cut out at more than 1/2 of full speed. Lots of you guys said get a new pedal. Got one off Amazon. Tried it this morning. Budda boom!  Runs like a champ. Different design. Hope it lasts.  Thanks everyone for your help  
1044036,North Channel Cottages,2019-05-06 00:49:00,18,That's awesome. Watch out fish!
1044037,HTHM,2019-05-06 04:45:00,4082,How much was it and could I get a link please?
1044039,b2kptbo,2019-05-06 10:32:00,1505,"Had the same problem with 2 Powerdrives I owned, try not to leave in rain or wet and if you cover your boat the heat can affect it as well..."
1044046,captpierre,2019-05-06 13:38:00,2521,"Just search Amazon ca. They changed the connector from the pedal to the motor in 2007,  I believe. From a flat connector to round. I think it was about  $120. A bit more at Bass Pro."
1044050,jimmer,2019-05-06 14:19:00,2730,I'm still pissed at Minn Kota for not making an adapter for this pedal to use on the older models. Glad it worked out for you though.
1044053,AKRISONER,2019-05-06 15:12:00,5558,i still wonder that if with a little wizardy you could make it work. I mean the wiring between the two units cant really be that different can it?
1044056,jimmer,2019-05-06 15:29:00,2730,"It probably could be rewired, but I'm not a wizard. LOL"
1048221,hutch4113,2019-08-08 14:45:00,374,"It appears that my pedal just bit the dust as well.  Glad you posted this, as the symptoms appear the same.  Not getting full thrust - and now no turns to left or right. I am debating a new Pedal - or going with Co Pilot.  How as the Pedal run for you, now that you have had it for a while?"
1048229,captpierre,2019-08-08 19:17:00,2521,"Runs perfect, Hutch.  New pedal seems more robust Now wishing I had a hand held remote and more importantly the anchor feature. Some new players in the trolling motor market now. I’ll wait and see what happens next year or 2.  I might survive till then. ?"
1048242,DRIFTER_016,2019-08-09 03:56:00,10439,I don't even know if the peddle on my V1 works. Haven't used it since I added copilot. Just use the remote now. ?
1048250,Fishn Technishn,2019-08-09 11:04:00,198,"Had this problem a few years ago. Decided it was time to upgrade to Ipilot. WOW!!! SO GLAD I DID!!! It is truly REVOLUTIONARY! Feels like you have been set free! Can control the Minnkota from anywhere within range. Even the dock! Grandkids LOVE Poppa's ""Magic boat!! I can have the little ones in the boat and I can ""tell"" the boat to turn left/go straight /stop etc. Very entertaining at least for me! Best option though is the ANCHOR button! Keeps u on spot as long as you have enough power to overcome wind or current. Mike"
1048347,jimmer,2019-08-12 15:29:00,2730,Did you have to change your connector from the flat one to the round one?
1048354,captpierre,2019-08-12 22:39:00,2521,No. Fortunately my V2 had the round connection
1048368,jimmer,2019-08-13 14:38:00,2730,"That makes it easy, I hope those pedals are a step up from the older ones.  It sounds like it. Happy fishing! However, I was kind of hoping to find someone that made the new foot pedal work on one of the older power drives."
1048426,Sinker,2019-08-15 14:43:00,8692,"Me too. My V1 pedal is starting to go. I guess if I dont find a used one somewhere I'm outta luck, eh? That really sucks. Time for I-pilot I guess. Better blow the dust out of my wallet.....ouch! "
1048427,jimmer,2019-08-15 16:07:00,2730,I'm holding out as long as I can after shopping around.  You're right about the ouch!
1048428,msp,2019-08-15 16:41:00,1336,till that one breaks down. went through 3 in ten years.
1048431,jimmer,2019-08-15 19:09:00,2730,Me too.
1048433,Sinker,2019-08-15 19:29:00,8692,"Yeah, I'm on my third as well.....and last apparently lol "
1048453,jimmer,2019-08-16 16:36:00,2730,I wonder how many good electric motors are going into the trash because Minn Kota decided not to support those models anymore? This throw away society gets to me sometimes.
1048501,206,2019-08-18 16:41:00,563,"I got 3 pedals out in garage all in various states of disassembly...I had the co-piolot on my old 40lbs and added the I-piolot to the 55lbs on my boat currently, not sure i could ever go back to a foot pedal lol "
1048530,jimmer,2019-08-19 13:39:00,2730,"So, are they compatible with the older power drives? I don't think they are."
