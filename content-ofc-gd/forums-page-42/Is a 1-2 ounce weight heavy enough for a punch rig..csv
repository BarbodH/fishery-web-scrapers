1048301,BillM,2019-08-11 13:27:00,17367,Heavier the better.  1/2oz is a bit light.
1048302,Bassin15,2019-08-11 14:11:00,19,Thanks.
1048324,David Chong,2019-08-11 23:02:00,836,Really depends on how heavy the cover that you're trying to penetrate! I usually start with a 5/8 oz. Ultra Tungsten bullet weight. Will use up to 2 oz. weights if need be!
1048326,grimsbylander,2019-08-11 23:59:00,3016,"1/2 is borderline ok for pads. As soon as you get into any floating mat, I agree with the other gentleman...1-2oz"
1048334,Bassin15,2019-08-12 11:31:00,19,"Thanks everyone, went out yesterday with the 1/2 ounce and it was tough getting it through some spots but i made it work, i don't do alot of punching so never needed a big weight.  Thanks for all the help."
1048335,AKRISONER,2019-08-12 11:50:00,5558,"i always try 3/4 tungsten when i can, but sometimes even it wont punch through really heavy stuff. Its rare 1oz tungsten wont get through unless you are really really in some greasy stuff. Generally if you are good enough at flipping you can hit the weak spots in what you are flipping through."
