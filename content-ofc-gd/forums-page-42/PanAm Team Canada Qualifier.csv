1048982,David Chong,2019-08-29 13:12:00,836,"Just wrapped up the PanAm Team Canada qualifying event on Lake St. Francis and my partner Rob Lee & I finished up in 2nd place! This qualifies us to compete on Team Canada at the upcoming 2019 PanAm Bass Championship to be held in Cornwall in Ottawa! Team Canada consists of 8 two person teams with captain, Bob Izumi & his son Darren being one of them! The is also the next step to competing at the World Black Bass Championship! The competition at this event was super tough requiring I’ve a 20 lbs. average per day to make the team! Throw in constantly changing weather with 5 straight days of east winds makes thing challenging! But this is one of the best Smallmouth Bass in the world! We weighed in 22.94 lbs. on day 1 to sit in the 2nd qualifying position and followed that up with a 20.26 lbs. bag on day 2 to maintain that spot! Every fish weighed in was a Smallmouth with numerous ones over 5 lbs. Scott Lucky & Andy Kinstler won the event with 44.6 lbs over the 2 days! Keys for our finish in this event were my Skeeter ZX 250 with the ever so reliable Yamaha 250 SHO to get around safely and quicker on this tricky body of water. My new Garmin EchoMap Ultra electronics loaded with the Canada LakeVu G3 charts complete with Navionics data enabled us find the structure & fish to make the team. Tackle-wise my Daiwa equipment loaded with Sunline perform flawlessly! Ultra Tungsten weights for Carolina rigging & drop shotting were critical to get that bottom feel in that heavy current! Z-Man Diesel Minnows & Trick Shot we’re our & the Smallies’ baits of choice! LOL My Skeeter live Wells, G-Juice, Oxygenators & V-T2 vents kept our fish alive & healthy! Fizzing our fish and adding ice also made a huge difference! They were all released to fight another day! Can’t wait to compete against the teams from the US, Mexico, Costa Rica, Puerto Rico & the First Nations in Oct.! Proud to wear the Maple Leaf again!     "

1048993,OhioFisherman,2019-08-29 15:06:00,6623,"Congrats David! That looks like the St. Lawrence River to me. Just curious, deep water fish? I watched last years elite series on the St. Lawrence and was kind of surprised to see a Carolina rigged lizard thrown in that for smallies."

1048999,David Chong,2019-08-29 16:16:00,836,We’ve been using a Carolina rig in heavy current for about 8 years now! The Elites are finally starting to catch on!!!
1049000,David Chong,2019-08-29 16:21:00,836,"Sorry, our fish were deep but the winners fished shallow!"
1049001,OhioFisherman,2019-08-29 16:30:00,6623,"No sorry s needed, depth is a relative term anyway, on Erie I was usually in 17 to 22 feet of water, and a lot of guys thought that was shallow."
