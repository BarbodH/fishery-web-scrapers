1048700,OhioFisherman,2019-08-23 02:34:00,6623,Just imagine how good it might be and stay if they banned commercial netting on all of Lake Erie?
1048702,Old Ironmaker,2019-08-23 03:03:00,8243,"Then it wouldn't be fair my Buckeye pal.I don't think I'll see it in my lifetime. Gino, my wife pointed out that the guy in photo's 5 and 6 could be my twin. She might be right. I don't think I have a recent, 25 years, pic of me without my hat and shades on and I'm not holding a fish. I'll look."
1048703,OhioFisherman,2019-08-23 03:19:00,6623,"Toxic algal bloom shuts down Columbia Road Beach in Bay Village That beach is only a couple of miles east of where I used to live in Avon Lake, the lake is facing a lot of challenges, doing everything possible to protect the fishery and water supply seems fair to me?"
1048704,gino,2019-08-23 09:58:00,400,Bring out the picture.?
1048735,Old Ironmaker,2019-08-23 21:37:00,8243,1000's of pics on here and I can't find one with me without shades and a hat on. I don't want to post a 15 year old pic 40 pounds heavier than now. I'll ask my wife if she has any.
1048764,Old Ironmaker,2019-08-24 14:13:00,8243,"A few years ago fishing Perch at Port Burwell buddy caught a jhet black 12"" Goby. I was told that's what the original sizes were when they first were found in Erie. I found an article saying the same thing."
1048765,Old Ironmaker,2019-08-24 14:15:00,8243,"This is the latest pic I have. If I find my phones patch cord I'll take a new one. Notte Bene, I locked my elbows! Not bad shape for 65. "
1048774,gino,2019-08-24 16:22:00,400,nice! Good size walleye ?
1048818,Squid,2019-08-26 11:18:00,1656,We will see what the government does. I am sure that they will close this office down.
1048851,Old Ironmaker,2019-08-27 01:57:00,8243,Like the article states Chatham is about 45 minutes from the Wheatly office. Chatham is only  20 minutes to Lake Sinclair. That move doesn't effect us much as Wheatly is where our CO's are stationed to the 3 hrs.and 12 mins away now to 3 hrs. and 57 minutes away if the office is moved to Chatham.
1048854,dave524,2019-08-27 10:37:00,4508,"When I worked for the ministry O.I. in the '70's you had a big MNR office in Simcoe and another in Fonthill in Niagara, I believe both are gone now, this downsizing has been going on long before the recent change in provincial government."
1048856,Squid,2019-08-27 11:17:00,1656,Its just the beginning with the present government. I can see them cutting back on environmental protection of our lakes and rivers and cut backs to the natural resources ministry next year. If one believes that this is not the case then you live in a glass house. For me its a non starter if a sitting government starts to play with our  natural resources.
1048875,Old Ironmaker,2019-08-27 18:14:00,8243,"It isn't just the PC's doing the downsizing of the MNR, the Libs had done it when they were in power. I bet it can go back to the NDP too. Not many tax paying Ontarians give a hoot about the MNR anyway. Please read my response above. Ask the majority of Ontario taxpayers if they would rather have a tax hike or have funding cut in the MNR I know what the answer would be, including so called environmentalists."
1048910,Squid,2019-08-28 11:11:00,1656,I don't care about who is in government I care about the resources. I would rather have a tax hike to save our natural resources and I am sure that you didn't s[peak to a majority of Ontario taxpayers.
1048931,Old Ironmaker,2019-08-28 21:30:00,8243,"I would say you are in the minority Squid but I may be wrong, I often am,"
1048934,dave524,2019-08-28 22:46:00,4508,"In my years with the Dept of Lands and Forests , then the Ministry of Natural Resources, not really sure of the new name, think Forests worked it''s way back into the name. It was my impression that under a Conservative Government they viewed hunters and fishermen as allies while the environmentalists that supported Liberal government policies tended to view hunters and fishermen as the enemy, just saying . Be careful what you wish for."
1048940,Old Ironmaker,2019-08-28 23:48:00,8243,I would have thought the opposite Dave. The libs being the tree huggers and the PC's big business that want's to forest and mine.
1048968,Squid,2019-08-29 10:55:00,1656,Again with the politics. I don't care and I am not here to argue. Just making a point that its stupid to even consider moving them. Thanks
1048622,gino,2019-08-21 00:35:00,400,"Hi there! Looks like a great year for walleye fishing and Erie is one of the best places to go for them . Been lately on a few occasions my buddies and we limit by noon every single time . It didn't matter if it was wavy or still, trolling was the ticket. We had several double header, even a few triple headers... Cheers! Gino        "
1048624,Old Ironmaker,2019-08-21 00:58:00,8243,"Took you until noon Gino? You guys must have gotten out late. LTM. I actually got in a boat last week and we went out of Nanticoke. Ran out to 50 feet of water, lines in the water at 8. 3 man limit and in by 11:00. It was ridiculous. That's a keeper fish every 8 minutes. Good going Gino. Some of those you have are the best eaters. Averaged about 3.5 lbs."
1048626,gino,2019-08-21 01:16:00,400,Lol..it was noon when I checked the clock...??. A lot of them got back to swim .
1048627,OhioFisherman,2019-08-21 01:41:00,6623,https://www.cleveland.com/sports/2019/08/lake-eries-fish-of-the-future-have-arrived-aug-16-fishing-report.html?fbclid=IwAR21Pm-F5IZRViZC7sCviGvPjB6cGiV-HsO7JOEd74AVCWYXLDlOCcMs1ac Nice catch could you tell what they were eating? That article mentions Emerald shiners are hard to come by on this side of the lake.
1048628,J Roelofsen,2019-08-21 04:54:00,84,"About 35mins for a limit out there before work tonight. Tried to take my time and sort for a limit of 4-5lb fish and ended up with 3 in that range along with 3 more @ 30+""! Not ideal but fun all the same. And I marked alot of bait out there tonight that I'm pretty sure we're Shiners. But yeah, in general Shiner numbers are way down. Josh"
1048631,dave524,2019-08-21 12:01:00,4508,With that many Pickeral I wonder why ?  I wonder if it will go the way of Lake Ontario with the average size of fish going down ? Over the years the biggest salmon has lost almost 10 pounds because of the collapse of the alewife population.
1048632,muskybw,2019-08-21 12:04:00,116,"Gino, great share, fantastic pics, and some really big wally's !"
1048633,gino,2019-08-21 12:13:00,400,"I found one perch in the 3.5 lbs walleye. A few shiners in the others, but not many. This walleyes were hungry, bite was aggressive"
1048634,J Roelofsen,2019-08-21 12:18:00,84,With the Zebra and Quagga mussels fully established throughout the great lakes nutrient levels have dropped across the board. Less nutrients and less prey fish could quite likely mean slightly smaller top end sizes for Walleye than what we saw in the 80's and early 90's. I just saw an article the other day regarding this year's Lake Ontario Alewife surveys.....not looking promising. Josh
1048635,dave524,2019-08-21 12:22:00,4508,"On the other hand as one that has fished Erie for 60 years, long before the Goby and Zebra Mussels,  6 is the new 4 when it comes to smallies ."
1048637,J Roelofsen,2019-08-21 12:39:00,84,The Gobies certainly help those Bass pack on the pounds! But even the average Goby size has been cut in half from what it was little more than a decade ago. It will definitely be interesting to see how their population holds up to the Walleye explosion. Josh
1048641,OhioFisherman,2019-08-21 14:00:00,6623,"Thanks gino, just was wondering if shad were becoming more of a food species for the walleye with the apparent shortage of Emerald shiners,"
1048643,gino,2019-08-21 14:52:00,400,"Ohio Fisherman, Erie has potential when u think about the lake as being shallower then all the other big lakes..it's the forage that sustains the walleye population. I think walleye will adapt faster , shad would definitely be a bait that walleye will eat for sure. Perch population is still healthy, I caught 3 jumbos,  all 3 of them over 13 inches while trolling for perch. Will see, time will tell...I saw over 100 boats in 2 days over a small are we've been, everyone got the limit, many walleye were released , bite was hot all day long."
1048649,OhioFisherman,2019-08-21 16:36:00,6623,"That size issue could be location also, we fished the western basin during the 1980's in the summer, the average size was 2 - 4 pounds, you could catch a limit in a hurry, but if you were looking for bigger ones you usually had to head east."
1048651,OhioFisherman,2019-08-21 16:49:00,6623,"Agreed, but the forage sustains a lot of species, there needs to be a healthy balance? I have seen huge schools of shad on this side of the lake that although not full grown were too big for perch and crappie to eat."
1048652,gino,2019-08-21 17:11:00,400,You're right. Balance will be the key.
1048658,misfish,2019-08-21 21:26:00,29133,Wheres the stringer shot ? LMAO J/K You guys have a great thing going on there.  Nice day out Gino.
1048665,gino,2019-08-22 00:49:00,400,"Thanks, Brian. Was great, indeed."
1048667,Whitespinnerbait,2019-08-22 01:05:00,2038,Great pics of those walleye.......???
1048671,BillM,2019-08-22 05:11:00,17367,I plan on hauling down the boat on Friday to see if the oldman and I can bag a few walleyes on Erie.  Should I launch out of Nanticoke or Colbourne?   Does it even make a difference this year as far as the fish are concerned?
1048673,gino,2019-08-22 09:54:00,400,"Bill, I spoke at the launch(P Burwell) with several fishermen...2 of them went from Nanticoke last week and did very well. Looks like if u are in 40-50 ft of water you'll get them . Just go! Post some pics. ?"
1048682,G.mech,2019-08-22 14:12:00,830,"Both Nanticoke and Burwell are on fire and I hear Maitland is good too but I haven't been myself.  I've been fishing Nanticoke south of the shoal the last few weeks with quick limits every trip and some nice sized fish.  Most fish are 20"" or so with a few in the 7lb range but not much in between.  There are some smaller ones too but they get released for next year.  They are moving deeper now and my last two trips this week we did best in 75-100 fow with 6,7,8 colour lead cores.  Others prefer dipsy divers or downriggers and they are all working too.    Crankbaits such as ripplin redfins (darker patterns) or spoons (greasy chicken wing, pink panties, blueberry muffin etc) are both producing, I don't think I've changed a lure in 4 trips.  You can launch in Port Dover or Nanticoke, it's a bit further to Dover but the ramps are far better; both are $20 bucks."
1048683,Squid,2019-08-22 16:09:00,1656,Interesting read. https://mnrwatch.com/ford-is-endangering-lake-erie-with-foolish-decision-to-move-conservation-officers-inland/
1048686,Old Ironmaker,2019-08-22 18:55:00,8243,"I would choose Nanticoke Bill. The fish are everywhere I hear but are moving west as they do every year. I think many of these Pics are locals fish based on their smaller sizes. Good luck. I don't have to tell you to check the weather and wind sites. They are even catching them in a NE and even due east wind. Unbelievable. Stopped by ""The Fish Shack"" just up creek from Hoovers Marina where he slips a dozen boats. Everyone limited out that day in 60' of water. You could launch there for 1/2 the price as Hoovers in the past but his dock wall is under water."
