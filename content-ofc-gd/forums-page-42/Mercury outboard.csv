1048983,Sinker,2019-08-29 13:13:00,8692,"I wouldn't even consider a boat with a merc. I almost did, because it was a great deal, but my gut told me otherwise. Go to the east coast and count how many mercs there are, compared to yamaha. ....or any coast for that matter. S."
1049017,Ralph Zettler,2019-08-29 20:47:00,10,I could be wrong but my 2013 40hp 4 stroke is a yamaha power head
1049025,lew,2019-08-29 21:48:00,12766,"I'm heading to the East Coast next Tuesday Shane, I'll try and get a count LOL"
1049052,Moosebunk,2019-08-30 01:49:00,3970,"Nobody ran Mercs where I lived in the north for 10 years, NOBODY!!!  Everyday crossing the river for work with the boat taxis never remember seeing one.  All Yammies or Hondas for reliability.  The odd Rude.  In Nunavut too, Mercs don't even exist, have yet to see one.  Sea goers don't choose them, it's mostly Yammies then Honda.  These people don't have access to Marinas and certified mechanics.  They can't get warranty work done without paying $100's to even  $1000's to ship a motor out.  They choose reliability. Been going to Nipigon for 10 years, sometimes 2 or 3 times a year.  Pay attention to what's at the docks.  Yammies outnumber Mercs 2 or 3 to 1, no Bull.  Guys on big water seem to know.  Honda is popular too Guided and fished with Mercs on fly-ins... half the time something was annoying about these motors and my next report coming was same thing with a BRAND NEW Merc. Visited Plummers this summer, all new Mercs there, couple of the veteran guides were wishing otherwise.  Main complaint, they won't slow troll smoothly, constantly needing attention to throttle. My good, good buddy, certified mechanic with Merc and Yamaha motors with the local dealership I use, recommends Yamaha as he notices far less service hours are needed for these motors. All good enough to sell me on the brand.  Sold the last Yamaha with pushing 3000 hours after 8 seasons, only let me down once cause after 5 years of not changing the impeller, owner neglect got the better of me.  Would likely never choose anything else but Yamaha. "
1049097,Sinker,2019-08-30 20:43:00,8692,"Theres the east coast, then theres the real east coast....you going all the way to the island?  Take pics of all the yammies, hondas, and etecs. The number of mercs will be slim.  S."
1049099,Old Ironmaker,2019-08-30 22:00:00,8243,"When I see programs on TV from far away places there are Mariners everywhere. I was told our Mariners were Mercs with Yamaha bottom ends and Mariner cowls, not so I have come to learn. I do believe Mercs get a bad name for breakdowns because there are so many out there. Most all the outfitters I have come across had Mercs in their fleets, many still do and those things are going on 30 years old. Maybe I didn't see and Honda or Yammies because they weren't selling them in the early 70's. Bunk wasn't fishing then I bet, not born even. Man I'm getting old. So old the Feds are giving me money this October and so old I still use a Mitchel 300 and mono on it."
1049100,lew,2019-08-30 22:18:00,12766,"We're going thru the States then New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and PEI but not hitting The Rock although I for sure want to do that trip one day."
1049102,Sinker,2019-08-30 23:07:00,8692,"My 93  40hp mariner is a yamaha engine, merc drive. Made in Japan. I replaced it with a new 40hp yammy this year, but old faithful is still running as good as ever. The new one is a dream in comparison though....so smooth, quiet, and trolls like a dream! S."
1049103,Sinker,2019-08-30 23:07:00,8692,"You should! Its like nowhere I've ever been, and I've been coast to coast! S."
1049109,lew,2019-08-30 23:21:00,12766,I sailed along the north shore of the island back in my Navy days and saw a couple iceburgs but that's a close as I got.
1049121,Old Ironmaker,2019-08-31 02:31:00,8243,I remember you had a Mariner Sinker. So my 94' Mariners the 15 horse kicker and 115 OB must be the same. Both as solid as ever. The 15 is actually louder than the 115. I sure wouldn't turn down a new 150 Yammy  4 stroke but sure don't need one.
1049122,Old Ironmaker,2019-08-31 02:38:00,8243,We are driving to the brother and sis in laws in mid September. Going to take the ferry at Bar Harbor to Nova Scotia. They are right on Mahon Bay. They said you can see the now famous Oak Island from there place. I've been to Sydney but never saw anything but the motel and the inside of the steel plant. Want to go to Cape Breton and take a ferry to Newfoundland. I can say I've been to NFLD because I asked the flight attendant if I could get off the plane on the way to Europe back in 88'. Once I have been there for more than 5 mins I can call it the Rock too. Cod cheeks here I come.
1049128,lew,2019-08-31 11:15:00,12766,I bought a new boat with a 90 Merc 4 stroke back in 1999 and drove that boat long & hard for 10 years and never had a single issue with it. 10 years later I sold it to a bud and he's been driving it long and hard since then and never had an issue with that Merc until 2 years ago when it went in the shop for it's 1st repair in 18 years. Nothing wrong with 18 trouble free years on a motor that's seen a LOT of use.
1048692,gino,2019-08-23 01:26:00,400,"Hey everyone, I am trying to see some opinions about a 2014 Mercury 25 hp 4 stroke outboard motor...the owner says it has around 400 hours of operation.  But runs good...to me it sounds like high hours...what you guys think? Thanks!"
1048693,DRIFTER_016,2019-08-23 01:49:00,10439,400 hours is not high for 4 stokes. We used 30 hp 4 stoke Mercs up at the lodge I worked at and they probably had 2000 hours or more when they were replaced. I believe once you get over 1200 hours they are starting to get up there.
1048697,porkpie,2019-08-23 02:25:00,2521,I don’t consider that particularly high hours.
1048698,OhioFisherman,2019-08-23 02:30:00,6623,"https://www.thehulltruth.com/boating-forum/446047-what-considered-lot-hours-outboards.html A lot of variables, a 25hp motor may not have been on a boat with a bow or transom electric motor and was the only source of power?"
1048705,gino,2019-08-23 10:02:00,400,"Thanks Dave, now the question is ...should I replaced my 2003 Yamaha 15 hp, 4 stroke with this 25 hp Merc? My boat is rated for 30 hp max. I might looking to get some more speed when loaded.  Yamaha is just perfect, can't complain...just looking for some more speed. Thanks!"
1048706,gino,2019-08-23 10:06:00,400,"Good read, thanks ?"
1048707,gino,2019-08-23 10:08:00,400,Another question would be...how much mph would I gain if I change from a 15 hp 4stroke to a 25 hp 4 stroke?? Is it worthy? I have a 14 ft aluminum boat. Thanks!
1048712,Sinker,2019-08-23 13:11:00,8692,That would be a major downgrade imo.  Mercs don't hold a candle to yammies.  S.
1048719,DRIFTER_016,2019-08-23 14:28:00,10439,You should gain some top end as well as better performance when loaded. As far as Sinkers claim of Yammies being that much better than Mercs I don't believe it. Sorry Sinker We had Mercs and Yammies and they were equal in performance and reliability. I would not recommend Honda's though as we tried a batch out at one of the lodges and the lower units were much less robust than the Yammies and Mercs. The lower units would blow apart itf you hit rocks while the others would hold up well under most impacts. 
1048720,dave524,2019-08-23 15:50:00,4508,Doesn't Tohatsu / Nissan make just about everything under 30 horse for everybody now ?
1048724,Old Ironmaker,2019-08-23 18:13:00,8243,I was told Yamaha make the bottom ends for Merc. You will get noticeable performance with 10 extra HP Gino. A 25 HP is 64% more than the 15. Think of it that way. Check my arithmetic I just woke up. Put in a shift at the Niagara Casino last night. I should have stayed home. I'll look for a pic without my shades and hat on Gino pisano mio.
1048741,John Bacon,2019-08-24 02:01:00,3277,"Tohatsu makes/made small Evinrudes, Mercury, Nissan (I'm not sure they're still available), as well as their own brand.  I believe that Honda, Yamaha, & Suzuki make their own."
1048744,Old Ironmaker,2019-08-24 03:12:00,8243,Tohatsu is who again? 
1048746,porkpie,2019-08-24 04:24:00,2521,A Japanese company that is one of the largest manufacturers of outboard motors in the world.
1048754,grimsbylander,2019-08-24 13:21:00,3016,"Personally, if your boat is rated for 30hp, I’d hang on to your Yamaha until you decide to upgrade and then go to a 30hp. Wouldn’t be overly concerned or influenced by brand opinions."
1048770,Sinker,2019-08-24 15:04:00,8692,"No need to apologize. I just haven't had good experiences with Mercs. All Brands are good, and they all have lemons. I had no trouble with my 1993 40hp yamaha built Mariner, and just repowered with a 2019 40hp Yamaha. The old one is still running like a top, and hanging in my garage. I just can't bring myself to sell it lol I really like the suzukis too.   S."
1048771,OhioFisherman,2019-08-24 15:30:00,6623,"10+ addition in horsepower is a big increase in smaller motors, you would be 5hp from doubling your hp. Prices and resale value for what you have and want to get?  On a bigger motor I wouldn't go crazy spending for 10 more hp."
1048787,gino,2019-08-25 00:36:00,400,"Thanks for replies, guys. ?"
1048900,chris.brock,2019-08-28 00:49:00,4053,"It seems like it's shrouded in secrecy who tohatsu makes engines for, you can do all the googling you want and never figure it out, you've gotta have the engines side by side and pull the cowls off and take a look to figure it out any brand can be great or be a lemon, but I've had good luck with Yamaha over the last 40 years, I just had a brand new merc cause us grief at a remote outpost last week, that seems pretty typical from what I've experienced with merc over the years  "
1048902,ecmilley,2019-08-28 02:03:00,2163,They all have there moments Ive seen more.problems in Merc mostly because there's more of them. Most issues I've had over years weren't manufacturing issues but rather operator has a screw loose
1048909,dave524,2019-08-28 10:09:00,4508,I have found that sometimes an increase in HP when both engines are built on the same block is marginal in reality compared to the same increase if there is a corresponding increase in displacement.
1048958,chris.brock,2019-08-29 02:24:00,4053,"that's interesting and makes sense the same block could have a bigger pistons and bigger displacement kinda interesting too, the new Suzukis the 9.9, 15 and 20 are all the same block, same bore and stroke, 327cc, and they all weigh the same "
1048960,Old Ironmaker,2019-08-29 02:57:00,8243,"My 15 HP Mariner kicker weights the exact same as my buddies Merc 9.9 does, 100 lbs. Size matters but there are 500HP V 4's out there, or even higher. In cars, maybe boats too. 400 hrs. for a Merc is just breaking in. If I was to upgrade HP I would go max for the boat. There will be a line up of boaters looking for your 15 HP Yammy. Sell it and get yourself a 30HP fill in the blank _______."
1048970,dave524,2019-08-29 11:14:00,4508,"Often if you look a little closer at the specs you will see the higher horsepower comes at a higher rpm when they are the same displacement, they tune them to run a bit faster for the increase in HP.  which does very little for acceleration and time to get up on plane."
1048977,David Chong,2019-08-29 12:35:00,836,400 hours is nothing for a four stroke engine! I’m a big Yamaha guy and have run their big block 4 strokes for many years with no major problems at all!
