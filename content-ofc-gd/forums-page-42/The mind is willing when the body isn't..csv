I can't even carry 1/2 sheet of drywall solo now. The frustrating  thing is trying to help my wife do something construction related  that I know is the correct way but she insists she can do it better ""her"" way. I know there is more than one way to skin a Cat but using a rock to skin it is just plain wrong. Then after 30 minutes of her trying it her way it took 3 minutes doing it the right way ""my way."" Ohhhh man!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
