1048588,Big Cliff,2019-08-20 14:36:00,6899," Ok, so the only thing missing is the kitchen sink LOL. My son and I had another wonderful weekend, did some fishing, exploring, and harvested some beaked hazelnuts. My CFMOTO is a year old now and I have to say I am super impressed, some of the trails we explored this weekend were through some pretty rough therein and this thing just eats it up. The power steering sure is a blessing for these old arms! We actually managed to wind our way through some very old logging trails, some places where there were no trails and managed to work our way up to a place called Tower Hill which according to Siri is 280 metiers above sea level. What a beautiful view and you could litterer see for miles , it was like being on top of the world. The beaked hazelnutsÂ  were something new to me, I never knew they existed until my son pointed them out to me, all these years living in the country and they are all over the place and I didn't even know. When I finally knew what to look for I was amazed at how many there were. If you've never tried them you are missing out, it's a bit of work but well worth it. Yes you can teach an old dog new tricks LOL. The catching was a bit slow this weekend, the best producer was a pink worm, it caught pike, large mouth, perch, some huge rock bass, and even a sunfish that had to be the smallest fish ever caught on a hook. Seriously, this thing wasn't more than 1 1/4 "" long and it attacked a 5"" plastic worm, talk about attitude? Next weekend it's off to visit some lakes I use to fish about 50 years ago, we didn't have ATVs back then so it was quite a hike to get back in to them. According to my son there is now a ""sort of trail"" but we'll be able to ride our bikes in to these lakes (I know I wouldn't be able to walk it anymore). Really loving having this little 2.3 Honda outboard, without it fishing some of these out of the way lakes would be a lot more challenging. Anyway, that's enough for this weeks report, I'll try to get a few more fish porn pictures for nest week.      "
