1048310,misfish,2019-08-11 18:16:00,29133,On charge every time I come off the water. Along with the trolling battery.

1048315,Fisherman,2019-08-11 19:55:00,7201,More for the little gel cells for winter.
1048321,Canuck,2019-08-11 22:14:00,491,Lead acid batteries will fail much earlier if you leave them partially charged for any length of time. They should be charged back up full every time after you use them to get the lead out of solution and back on the plates.
1048323,David Chong,2019-08-11 22:59:00,836,My batteries are always put on charge as soon as it gets parked.The beauty of having a 4 bank on board charger!
1048336,AKRISONER,2019-08-12 11:53:00,5558,"yup, onboard chargers arent even that expensive these days. For the cost and convenience they probably maintain your investment, especially if you are buying good batteries, or for a guy like Dave Chong hes probably gone full Lithium?"
1048343,Sinker,2019-08-12 13:39:00,8692,Put them away fully charged and clean. Good to go.  Boat batteries are either in use or being charged.   S.
1048346,Terry,2019-08-12 15:14:00,14456,Some how I think it was for icefishermen and their portable units he was giving the tip to and it was a good tip I put my finders and underwater cameras on charge and my electric auger too
1048360,ecmilley,2019-08-13 04:38:00,2163,All my batteries always on charge. My portable FF battery I put on charge once a month
1048509,206,2019-08-18 18:22:00,563,got to a lake last week only to realize i removed a battery to charge on big charger and it never went back in...
1048512,Old Ironmaker,2019-08-18 19:11:00,8243,"I have learned enough about batteries to write a book. My best advice, never let them go below 20%. Most batteries have a limited number of charges from dead or less than 20%. The number of discharges determines the cost of the battery. Also when buying a new batteries manufacture date.  Retailers will always flog the oldest batteries they have. Like buying milk. I put the receipt in a good Ziplock freezer bag and duct tape it to the side of the battery. I can never find receipts for returns. I do it with most stuff I buy, my wife has receipts going back 26 years."
1048513,misfish,2019-08-18 19:29:00,29133,I have been using the same battery going on 7 years. It is used for 9 months of the year. I charge it after every use. Weather it be 2 hours or 8 hours.  I still have 4 new ones that have yet to be used. Nice to have friends in high places. Or might be low places.  ?
