With that said,the wind was to be light out of the N/E. With a continuing  cold front that started yesterday. I get to my launch and the wind is more then just a bit light, but still do able on the toon. Temp was 8 deg which warranted the use of the hoodie this morning.   It was a cool rolly ride to say the least.   The sky was looking like it was full of lava. Another great sight to behold.      Not really marking a bunch of fish, I was force to move a ton. Would mark, drop and they would be gone. The amount of bait was super crazy all morning. I could see the shinners on the surface. Would explain the terns diving all around me. Fish were tight to the bottom all morning. A cold front will do this here. Also the current was really whacked. I was still and my line was 45 deg going east.   After being out there for 4 hours moving about, I hit my last spot I had locked on the map and has produced. I was going to sit til it was time to get off. The current seemed to have died and I knew this would be a good thing. Well that decision payed off. I really like using my swim baits for the chase game,but a buddy tells me he has been getting them on the vibrato. SO, I drop one down, 30 ft from bottom. Letting the rollers do all jigging motion, I just sat and watch the screen. It was only 5 minutes and this red line comes streaking from the depths.  I didn't have to crank much as it was on the bait like stink. It was a good battle. At first I thought it was going to be that trophy laker. Dove right to the bottom an stayed there just thumping the rod down. He had my toon turning left,then right. I am pumped. Finally I start to gain a bit. Then the rod goes slack. No lost him. Reel and reel and the rod almost gets ripped out of my hands. Dives back down. These lakers are crazy crazy. I eventually get it top side, get the vibrado out of it,s yap,quick pic and back down he went. Not the size I thought for the fight he gave, still a respectable Simcoe greaser. As much as I like the big fight, it would be nice to hook up with some smaller ones for a change. Maybe Sunday morning. Oh it,s another Sunday morning..............      Long read for a single fish, but I am just sitting here doing nothing anyways.LOL    "
