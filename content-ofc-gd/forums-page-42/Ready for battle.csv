So off the water early, head home, fix pin hole leak, grab my fall weapons of choice, clean,spool with fresh line. Soon my babies, very soon,you will be reunited with me and the river,,,,,,,,,,,,,,  Theres that Whisker SS I was telling ya about in the reel thread.

1049159,MJL,2019-08-31 21:46:00,2427,"Daiwa Whisker SS? At school, our teacher told us that’s what the dinosaurs used to fish with before they went extinct. You must be ancient. ? "

1049163,misfish,2019-08-31 21:59:00,29133,LOL Great to hear from you Mikey. Be seeing you soon bud. There is a skunk tied on to that rod BTW.
1049164,misfish,2019-08-31 22:02:00,29133,"I have 2, gen 2 ones. The black 3,s models Dave. And extra spools. It was the one to have in the 80,s. Bought at K-Mart in Brampton $45.  I have not used them in 30 plus years. Sitting collecting dust.  Had to edit due to years forgot. LOL"
1049165,dave524,2019-08-31 22:07:00,4508,"I had a green 4 and a beige 3, think the beige one was an Abu not an original Zebco, lost both in a break in to my van at Queenston, Had to replace them with the same Abu black ones you got with the skirted spools and that infernal line clip that quickly got removed."
1049166,misfish,2019-08-31 22:14:00,29133,I found a green 3 at a garage sale probly 83. Guy said a he would take a buck for it. Nothing wrong with it. I flipped it a month later for $270. You wont get that now a days. LOL
1049169,Old Ironmaker,2019-09-01 00:44:00,8243,I don't see many sunrises as of late. But drove into a beauty of one this morning on my way to a golf tourney east of our place.  Very similar to the one you posted today Brian. Magnifico.
