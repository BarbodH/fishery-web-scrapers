I did a DIY repair that got me through the season, but it's leaking again. i'll probably just try another DIY repair after calling the place in Oakville, they wanted $100+ an hour + materials. Wouldn't give me a fixed price(on a patch?). Anybody know a place or person that might be a reasonable cost? I'm in Niagara, so hopefully some place nearby.."
