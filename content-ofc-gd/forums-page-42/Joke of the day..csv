A great way to start a day with a good yoke. Do you have one? One of my faves. A guy goes out with the boys and gets hammered, he pisses his pants, again. He tells the guys, ""My wife is going to kill me, I pissed myself, again!."" His buddy says "" No problem Pal. Put a 20 buck bill in your shirt pocket and tell your wife that some drunk pissed on you and gave you a 20 to cover the cleaning bill."" ""Great idea.""  he says and heads home. She greats him and flips out because he has done it again. He says "" Honey it wasn't me, some guy pissed on me and gave me a 20 for cleaning."" She reaches in his pocket and pulls out 2 20's not 1. ""Why 2 20's you drunken fool?"" "" I can explain that no problem Dear, he crapped in my pants too!"""

It was a very hot day and the ceremonies took place outside in a local grandstand. The Mayor was surprised to see that Chretien was wearing a large fox fur hat, despite the heat. After a while the mayor leaned over and spoke up. ""Excuse me, Mr. Prime Minister, but I can't help wondering why you are wearing that fox hat when it is so warm?"" Chretien shrugged. ""Well, you know 'ow it is"", he replied. ""My wife, she is da dresser in da family, so I always take 'er advice. If I go to de Maritime, she say 'Wear da toque'. If I go to Calgaree, she say 'Wear da stetson'. Dis time she ask me where I go; I say Flin Flon. She say 'Flin Flon! Where da fox hat ??' So I did!"" "

The doctor came in and said, “Well, I’ve got some good news and some bad news.  The bad news is that you have an inoperable brain tumor.  The good news is our hospital has just been certified to do brain transplants and there has been an accident right out front and a young couple was killed and you can have whichever brain you’d like.  The man’s brain costs $100,000.00 and the woman’s brain costs “30,000.00.”  The patient could not help but ask, “Why such a large difference between the male and the female brain?”  The doctor replied, “The female brain is used."

1048567,Old Ironmaker,2019-08-20 03:59:00,8243,It made the rounds today. My wife told me she got some giggles at work this afternoon. One reason I like joke of the day is I can never remember a good joke. Nothing worse than wasting peoples time telling a joke and you can't remember the punch line. It's exactly how you feel if you are on stage and can't remember your line. But if I read it in the morning I can remember it for a few hours anyway.

1048581,HTHM,2019-08-20 12:57:00,4082,"On a planet far far away, there lived a race of aliens called the Trids. On this planet there was a mountain, and atop the mountain was a tree which hosted the most delicious fruit known the the Trid race. But there was a problem: there was a cave near the top that was home to a monster, and every time the trids tried to climb to the top of the mountain, the monster would run out and kick them all back down. The trids became tired of this, and so they contacted Earth to ask for help. Earth didn't find this to be that big of a problem as they were at war and dealing with many different things, so they sent over a rabbi. The Trids were happy to have any help they could get, and so they gladly accepted. The rabbi arrived and wanted to get straight to business, calling all of the Trids to the base of the mountain. A lot of them were too frightened, so only some showed up. The rabi led the Trids most of the way up the mountain, only to have the monster come out and kick all of the Trids down but not the rabbi. Frustrated, the rabbi went to the Trid village and told them that in order to get to the top, they would all have to show up and work together. The next day more Trids showed up, but not all of them were there. The rabbi sighed, leading them up to have the monster once again kick down all of the trids, but leave him standing. The rabbi went back to the Trid village and told them that if every single last Trid wasn't in attendence the following day, he would return to Earth without helping them. The next day, every single Trid was there. The rabbi smiled and started leading the Trids up the mountain, this time quite confident that they would make it all the way up. But as usual, the monster ran out of his cave and managed to kick every single Trid back down the mountain, once again leaving the rabbi standing. The rabbi went to the monster's cave and asked ""Monster, why do you only ever kick down the trids, but always leave me standing?"" To which the monster replied ""Silly rabbi, kicks are for Trids."""

He walks into a grocery store and walks around in amazement at all the stuff he could buy there. Heads to the meat section and see's people buying these things called ""sausages"".

The next day he tells his wife, honey I bought these ""sauce-ages"" on the mainland, they seem to be all the rage. I'm going out fishing, but when I get back, I'd like to try those ""sauce-ages for dinner. Off he trots out the door.

He looks at the ""sauce-ages"" and there is nothing there but a pile of skin and a puddle of grease. He asks his wife ""what happened to my ""sauce-ages""?

The guy from Corona sits down and says, “Hey Senor, I would like the world’s best beer, a Corona.” The bartender dusts off a bottle from the shelf and gives it to him.  The guy from Budweiser says, “I’d like the best beer in the world, give me ‘The King Of Beers’, a Budweiser.” The bartender gives him one.  The guy from Coors says, “I’d like the only beer made with Rocky Mountain spring water, give me a Coors.” He gets it.  The guy from Guinness sits down and says, “Give me a Coke.” The bartender is a little taken aback, but gives him what he ordered.  The other brewery presidents look over at him and ask “Why aren’t you drinking a Guinness?” and the Guinness president replies, “Well, I figured if you guys aren’t drinking beer, neither would I.”"

1048648,Reef Runner,2019-08-21 16:05:00,980,"A man was stopped by a game-warden in Northern Algonquin Park recently with two buckets of fish leaving a lake well known for its fishing. The game warden asked the man, “Do you have a license to catch those fish?” The man replied to the game warden, “No, sir. These are my pet fish.” “Pet fish?!” the warden replied. “Yes, sir. Every night I take these here fish down to the lake and let them swim around for a while. I whistle and they jump back into their buckets, and I take em home.” “That’s a bunch of crap! Fish can’t do that!” replied the warden in disbelief. The man looked at the game warden for a moment and then said, “Here, I’ll show you. It really works.” “O.K. I’ve GOT to see this!” The game warden was curious. The man poured the fish into the river and stood and waited… After several minutes, the game warden turned to the man and said, “Well?” “Well, what?” the man responded. “When are you going to call them back?” the game warden prompted. “Call who back?” the man asked. “The FISH,” the warden said sternly. “What fish?” the man asked."
