I only had one of the large 5""+ ones and caught a ton of trout on it before I lost it due to operator error. ? 	I looked for replacements but was having a hard time locating them as they seem to be discontinued now. 	I did manage to locate them and placed an order with SAIL.ca  	Just checked and there are none of the colours I bought left.  	Good thing I bought a ton of them. ? "
