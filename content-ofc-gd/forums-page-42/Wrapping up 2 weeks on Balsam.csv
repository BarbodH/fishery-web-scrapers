My boat is slow so I have been hanging around Southbay and Ant Island.  Fishing has been ok but not great. I put ALOT of hours on the lake these 2 weeks and besides the 7-8 pikes I lost 4-5 including a bass. Never seen a wallaye these 2 weeks which is unusual. I can't totally be disappointed as being lazy I threw out a wallaye harness and worms and trolled back slow from Southbay. Caught a 42"" musky on the cheap CT walleye harness, took pics and had a healthy release. Makes me laugh thinking of all the $30+ musky lures I have for those Lake St. Clair trips. Here are some pics, didnt bother with pike pics although they were decent 24-28.  Everytime I see this island it reminds me of that island you could see infront of old Stelco before going over the skyway bridge in Hamilton.  Pictures are unedited without lensflares/chromacrushing or colorgrading, I think mother natures makes it perfect already.    The pikes were great meals.   ""Toothy"" was released and swam away reminding himself to never be tempted by a $2 walleye harness again. "

1048485,Raycaster,2019-08-17 19:52:00,528,"Would make another thread but during the 2 weeks actually figured out the Terra Nova would keep you on a straight path using the standard Auto Pilot. I have cursed for years using the advanced Auto Pilot. I know the difference between the 2 so always assumed the advanced was better. Well, the standard Auto Pilot works perfect or me now!"
