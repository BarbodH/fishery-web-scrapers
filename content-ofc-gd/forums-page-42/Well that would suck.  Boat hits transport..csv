1049059,lew,2019-08-30 12:06:00,12766,Guess he forgot to hook his safety chains up after he forgot to secure the trailer to his car properly. Luckily it was just a small boat.
1049067,mamona,2019-08-30 13:31:00,597,"Like you said, Luckily it was just a small boat. 	I never start driving without double checking if boat is secured, trailer properly hooked up, all lights working. Maybe he tried to steal the boat? "
1049074,KawarthaAngler,2019-08-30 14:22:00,273,Probably just an honest mistake.  My old man did the same thing to our utility trailer 2 years ago ... but thankfully the chains were attached which saved us a lot of grief.
1049075,LeXXington,2019-08-30 14:28:00,1928,I was saved once by the safety chains after a huge pot hole bump at low speed.  Always remember those chains
1049076,lew,2019-08-30 14:35:00,12766,Just guessing here but I'd imagine he'd be charged by the police for the unsafe hook-up.
