My hook up rate is well below 50%, but the blow ups are so much fun, I don't really care. Best bass so far has been a 19"" fat largie. How late in the year have you successfully fished the pads? Do they lose oxygen like other weedy areas? "
1048585,OhioFisherman,2019-08-20 13:53:00,6623,"I fished them until late September at Pointe Au Baril, I assume they deplete the oxygen content as they die off and break down, but I don't know how much of a factor that is. Location and luck always seemed more of a factor?"
1048604,Old Ironmaker,2019-08-20 17:14:00,8243,"Right until the end of Sept depending on the water temps. You can see them dying off just like the stuff in the flower gardens in Fall. Or until I caught them all. Love fishing slop for Largemouth, mostly done in Florida, not much die off but there is some even there.  Have even caught the odd Walleye under the pads in Fall here. It's been a while, I miss that style of fishing, flipping the slop too. You should try that while you are there."
1048605,kickingfrog,2019-08-20 17:30:00,8333,Right until I start hunting in mid September.
1048644,slopster,2019-08-21 15:20:00,7,In the Kawarthas I've caught largies into October after the leaves have dropped off and all that's left is stems. I think water temp is a bigger factor that time of year. So long as the forage base is there.
1048645,SirCranksalot,2019-08-21 15:39:00,3291,"They seem tohide in the shade of the pads when the sun is out and the water temp is warm. Cools off mid Sept, IMO"
