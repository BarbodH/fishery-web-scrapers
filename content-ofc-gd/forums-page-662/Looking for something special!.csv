481261,Big Cliff,2010-06-30 19:53:00,6899,"OK, my 65th birthday is coming up in January and I would like to do something special in the way of a fly in fishing trip so I am looking for some ideas.  Here is what I am looking for:  First class all the way, superb fishing and accomodations with a guide and camp cook and I don't mean some schmo that makes a good stew, like I said first class!  I don't want to have to clean a fish, wash a plate, or cook anything. All I want to do is go and fish till my arms hurt, eat until my belly hurts, (and if I feel like it, drink until my head hurts).  This is going to be a ""once in a life time"" for me and I would like it to be something I can always look back on with fond memories. So, where better to start than right here.  Lets hear your ideas and thoughts onn this one."
481265,alexcba,2010-06-30 19:59:00,634,not sure if your into trout and salmon but my cousin went out to langara lodge out in bc and had the time of his life. i was thinking about taking my dad there for his bday and get him into some monster west coast fish.  http://www.langara.com/site/  what ever you decide i hope you have an epic time cliff.
481269,misfish,2010-06-30 20:02:00,29133,"Cliff, I have been looking at visiting lake esnagi. It,s fly or train and from what I have been told by the members here,lots of fish and great place to go. I figured it would cost both Betty and I about 2300 for a week at first class.Truely a trip of a lifetime."
481270,solopaddler,2010-06-30 20:10:00,8605,What species of fish would you prefer? How far are you willing to travel to the jump off point?
481275,Big Cliff,2010-06-30 20:23:00,6899," Trout, walleye, salmon, species isn't too important and I'm not a ""record"" kind of guy, I'd be happy with good numbers of decent fish. I have fished the West coast and a lot of points in Ontario and Quebec. Loved salmon fishing but the numbers were few, sizes large.  How far would I be willing to travel to the jump off point? Either coast is within limites. The most important thing to me is the quality of the trip 4-6-8-24 hours are just small numbers in the whole picture."
481280,g_clot,2010-06-30 20:37:00,104,"I'd go redfish, snook and tarpon fishing inshore flats, offshore and maybe some on the fly down in the keys.  Although - BP may have killed that dream.  Does that count as a pain and suffering lawsuit?  lol  "
481285,solopaddler,2010-06-30 20:52:00,8605," Okay then, so basically anywhere in Canada for any species LOL!  Starting in the east I'd take a close look at Minipi lodge in Labrador for giant brook trout:   http://www.minipilodges.com/  In Ontario we have many outstanding 5 star fly in lodges for walleye and pike. Here's just a couple I'm familiar with:  http://www.esnagami.com/  http://www.leuenberger.ca/kag.htm  Manitoba has God's lake and river for trophy fish of several species (walleye, pike, lakers, brook trout)  http://www.godsriverlodge.com/  Also in Manitoba is Knee Lake, a trophy pike factory:  http://www.northstarresort.ca/  The NWT has the legendary Plummers Lodge on Great Bear lake. Truly 5 star, lots of big lakers and fly outs for char:  http://www.plummerslodges.com/  BC has many fine 5 star salmon lodges. This is one of the best:  http://www.langara.com/site/?id=4"
481292,Tybo,2010-06-30 21:31:00,1373,"Cliff, If you really want to go big time. Black Marlin fishing off the coast of Australia."
481298,Spiel,2010-06-30 21:44:00,9065,  I'd be all over this one if the choice was mine.  Regardless of what you choose Cliff I hope it becomes the fishing trip of your dreams.
481300,craigdritchie,2010-06-30 21:48:00,1586,"The real question is, how much do you want to spend?"
481302,Musky or Specks,2010-06-30 22:02:00,2710,I know a few people who have done Plummers and they said it was the best thing they've ever done. Don't forget the grayling fishing.
481310,TDunn,2010-06-30 22:26:00,680,"I'd be going to a lake trout lake on either slave, great bear or athabasca. Many of my friends have guided Here on Athabasca. Ive seen the pictures and videos and its definitly once in a lifetime....Any of the trophy lake trout lakes are....Plus huge pike and grayling as mentioned above!  TDunn"
