482011,JohnF,2010-07-03 21:44:00,3494,"Well, I went fishing today with a new fishing buddy, actually a new neighbour in our condo, and whilst standing in the river suffering from heavy rod anxiety decided the Cumara had to happen. So after we got home I scurried over to the Fishing Store and picked up the Cumara .... oh, and it seemed a shame to put any of those heavy reels I have on such a nice light rod, sooooooo ...    That's a little bitty Stradic (the darned kid wouldn't sell his) with 14# braid on a 7'2"" Medium weight Extra Fast action Cumara.  And here's my new fishing buddy Lloyd. For you old farts who remember the Mercy Brothers, a country kinda group, that's the drummer brother.    So all in all that's a pretty good day. New friend, new rod and new reel. No fish though.
