481858,Cudz,2010-07-03 04:08:00,2652,I have 2 reels spooled with braid and I want to use them on Lake O for salmon.  Do I have to run a mono of fluoro leader or is braid fine?
481862,moemoe,2010-07-03 04:20:00,352,"What type of reels? You can definitly use braid for dipsey divers, and in if necesssary on riggers, but mono helps absorb some of shock and keeps the fleas off which are just beginning to show, If you were going to run spoons of the lines, I would use a florocarbon leader"
481863,Cudz,2010-07-03 04:28:00,2652,The reels are abu Garcia 6000s.  Thanks
481893,Fang,2010-07-03 12:18:00,1330,Capacity is the most important thing. If your 6000's have 20-30 lb braid. You'll do fine. Run 5 or 6 ft of mono leader 20lb. 200 yd or more capacity is a must
