481815,gdelongchamp,2010-07-03 00:32:00,199,Nope. I was there one year and we rented from the lodge/marina at the other end. Killarney Lodge? Boats and motors were fine.
481817,Dave Bailey,2010-07-03 00:43:00,1641,"Yeah, just found their web site this morning. Looks like about six of one, half dozen of the other. No need to rush our decision, we've got a while yet."
