481722,Tdel,2010-07-02 18:47:00,393,"  When I troll for pike with spoons I usually find the weed beds and troll along the edges.  Test the action of the spoon to make sure you have the right trolling speed on the motor set before letting the line out completely.  If the speed is too fast your spoon will not stay down and start surfing. It will also twist your line.  If the action of the spoon is too slow pike might not show interest in it at all.  After setting the speed to get the action out of the spoon that you like, every now and then steer a zig zag pattern. Your spoon will speed up on one of the turns and slow down on the other turn. This will give your spoon a different look to the fish. Williams Whitefish is a spoon I like to use when trolling for pike. A large Red and white Daredevil is another one.  Tom."
