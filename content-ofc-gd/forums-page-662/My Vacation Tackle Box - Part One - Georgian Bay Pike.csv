478992,g_clot,2010-06-24 13:12:00,104,"I had luck earlier this season with the XR-10 in gold, boated two around 30"" in an afternoon.  The Husky Jerk in clear perch as mentioned earlier.  Koppers LIVETARGET perch or Herring.  Mepps #5 Black Flury in the red or chartreuse have a sturdy reputation there as well.  Last but not least, Northlands In-Line bucktail spinner in black and red."
479153,BillsTheBassMan,2010-06-24 19:49:00,932,"@ Nipfisher:  You like Rapalas as much as I do apparently - I've got 3 Trays of the things and that doesn't include the ones that are too big to fit in the trays.  You like firetiger more than me though   I prefer normal perch patterns, though firetiger plays its roll in stained water.   Yeah, I have 2 of the LiveTarget that I forgot to metion (as they were in my vest) - I can't wait to fish those baits in a water where they are meant to be fished.  Apparently those things are flying off the shelves wherever they are sold, despite the hefty price tag.  I bought a bluefox vibrax 6 bucktail spinner on sale for 8.99 (12.99 at CT).  It's firetiger - a musky or big pike bait.  I'm going to buy its twin in silver (spinner) bucktail (black & red) as well.  Thanks for the advice."
479165,g_clot,2010-06-24 20:14:00,104,  Got yourself a good deal there - whereabouts if you don't mind my asking?
479171,BillsTheBassMan,2010-06-24 20:26:00,932," Fishing Fanatics in Waterloo - They're listed at 9.99, but I get 10% off of everything."
479296,Nipfisher,2010-06-25 03:11:00,2449,"I mainly fish Nipissing and it is very dark (silty) water. Firetiger works well here for pike. In the one shot I have 3 of the Johnson's Woodchopper baits. They sit on the water and with the slightest pull the rear prop spits up water. I have had some nice fish on them. I'm looking for a 48""-50"" this year. I have a buddy who is a guide and I think I'll actually pay him."
479320,a.cortellessa,2010-06-25 04:19:00,142,"Rapala taildancer number 9 for walleye and husky jerks for pike, a bit bigger id say. Big bass will hit them as well."
479514,BillsTheBassMan,2010-06-25 20:48:00,932," Sadly, I don't think we're going to dedicate too much time on Walleye on this vacation.  As we don't know the water that well, we fear that we'll have to dedicate too much prime fishing time to find honey holes.  For now the HJ8-HJ10 will have to suffice as I dont want to drop the $40 on 4 more Rapalas - I generally just get them on Ebay in the off seasons as they are much cheaper."
482020,adempsey,2010-07-03 22:30:00,1498,"Not required, but you might consider some pike flies.  I tried some on my last trip and had some fun.  I used my spinning gear with a spin bubble and tied the fly on using some Tygear leader material.  Just something different.  Cheers."
482168,Radnine,2010-07-04 11:28:00,1538,Take a book. The fishing is crap everywhere this year. Jim
482170,TC1OZ,2010-07-04 11:53:00,987," Here, here! I was at my cottage in parry sound and I usually get nice pike on the regular but only a few and they were the tiniest I've caught in my life."
482205,ctranter,2010-07-04 14:56:00,543,"I went to my cottage in the Parry Sound area as well, and the Smallies were definitely off.  Normally I have the lake to myself, but 4 other boats were on (I'm assuming they were campers), and all reported slow fishing over the 3 days I was there.  Very disappointing to hear its the case elsewhere, but I'm sure it will pick up soon."
482209,TC1OZ,2010-07-04 15:07:00,987," I'm worried, the cribs left by the old boat house on the front of my island had ZERO rock bass and usually you are trying to reel in fast over the crib to avoid them.... And there were only a few smallies around the island and not too many in a smaller back bay that usually has 100's... I just hope it was the weather   There were about 20 big spawning smallies around my island on the May 24 weekend, I saw them when I took the kid around in the canoe. And I was getting decent sized pike then.... Probably just a bad week for fishing!"
477919,BillsTheBassMan,2010-06-21 23:45:00,932,"Hello Folks,  I'm counting down to my week-long cottage rental on Sans Souci (Frying Pan Island) in Georgian Bay.  The area is loaded with fish from Rainbow to Salmon (sparingly) to Lakers, Bass, Walleye, and apparently some Alligator Pike!  I'm going to do a little series leading up to the trip of the selected weapons for each species.  Those of you who have tackle suggestions, technique input, or general comments, feel free to share them!    (I'm having problems uploading the other two images - I'll try to add them shortly!)"

477927,alexcba,2010-06-21 23:57:00,634,"seems like your all set. lol that wally diver is a killer!!  if i could recommend anything else it would be a few perch colored x raps, and maybe 1 or 2 silver x raps or husky jerks."
477929,BillsTheBassMan,2010-06-22 00:08:00,932, The Husky Jerks and X-Raps are in there - but they just didn't show up that well.  My perch baits are shad raps of various sizes.
477933,backbay,2010-06-22 00:20:00,773,"HJ 14 in Perch and glass, same with XR 10a ans 12s. This time of year, a larger Big O in Natural Crawdad wouldn't hurt. either. Good luck, it's a great place you're going to!"
477941,Musky or Specks,2010-06-22 00:52:00,2710,Some big ole pork trailers for those spinner baits
477943,ctranter,2010-06-22 00:56:00,543,"I need to get me one of those duckling baits, just to freak my fishing friends out."
477948,Paully,2010-06-22 01:09:00,712, That purple Minnow Rap on the right side is great for walleye in the deep water current..
477981,Dozer,2010-06-22 02:03:00,896,"Yummy, looks like you've got a great arsenal.  Those rapala slashbaits really move, I just picked up a couple and damn are they ever cool."
477982,SBCregal,2010-06-22 02:03:00,688,pliers and jaw spreaders!!
478013,BillsTheBassMan,2010-06-22 02:53:00,932," You really must be old  You know what, I'm going to give the pork rinds a try . . . all my pre-1985 fishing books rave and rave about the Pork Rinds."
478021,BillsTheBassMan,2010-06-22 03:03:00,932," I buy old tackle boxes loaded with lures from people and that little number was in the bottom of one - I have yet to fish it, but will give it a few casts for kicks."
478024,BillsTheBassMan,2010-06-22 03:04:00,932," Sweet, thanks.  I love the perch patterns, they generally do really well for me.  HJs are my favourite Rap, though it's close with the X-Rap."
478026,alexcba,2010-06-22 03:05:00,634,lol better hope a mother duck doesn't try to adopt it..
478040,RudeBuoy,2010-06-22 03:26:00,28, What... pulling out a box full of live baby ducklings wouldn't freak 'em out?
478261,troutboy,2010-06-22 19:23:00,125,Get a size 4 mepps aglia spinner in fire tiger colour.I use them all the time up north here and get a ton of pigs.
478282,BillsTheBassMan,2010-06-22 20:00:00,932," Yeah  I knew the spinner section of my box is a little low, as I don't often go for Pike.  I'll bite the bullet and get a few."
478323,wallacio,2010-06-22 21:08:00,475,"Williams Whitefish spoons - when trolled at the right speed so they are ""thumping"", big fish will absolutely smash them!  "
478325,fishnsled,2010-06-22 21:13:00,3520, I'll second that. Trolling or casting.
478359,IndySKS,2010-06-22 23:06:00,134,Wana sell the duck ?
478751,BillsTheBassMan,2010-06-23 21:14:00,932," You can PM me with what you want to pay for it   For at least another week, it is unfished!  Picked up a few more baits for the vacation, but denied the Williams Whitefish, as to me, it appears to be a Daredevil Spoon for $9.  Ryan"
478797,ciceri,2010-06-23 23:34:00,535,Spoons are all you really need.
478881,Nipfisher,2010-06-24 03:06:00,2449,Here is a few shots of some of my pike stuff. Not too many spinner baits. Mainly crankbaits and about 80% are Rapala.         These 2 shots are of spinners I had made for me. They'll get wet for the first time in the next couple of weeks.       Spoons are in another tray
478961,fish_fishburn,2010-06-24 12:23:00,1311,A Johnson Silverminnow is a good choice as well. Also in shallow water around wood and rocks try a spoon and retrieve it really fast so the spoon is on the surface creating a nice topwater commotion. If there is big pike around the strikes will be violent.
