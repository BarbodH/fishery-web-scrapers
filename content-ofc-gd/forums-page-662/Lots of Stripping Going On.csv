481915,Tybo,2010-07-03 13:48:00,1373,"I would go the helicoil way.Just make sure you glue the coil in. If not,It could and eventually will back out in plastic or composite. No rust or oxidation to hold it in."
481691,TC1OZ,2010-07-02 17:06:00,987,"Well the topic is a bit misleading  But I'm having an issue with my Minn Kota Trolling Motor.  The mechanism that stops the shaft from going up and down has stripped, the bolt that's used for tightening it can just be pulled out by hand!    I bought this used from someone, and I had it out on the water several times with no issues. Just happened this weekend when I was out on the water. I have no idea if its under warranty and I think Minn Kota has shut down till after the 4th...  I figure I could buy a bigger bold to just re-thread it...?  While I was out over the holiday I just used some duct tape on the bottom once I got it lined up... but it just looks like trash! (it did work however)   Anyone else experienced this what did you do to fix it?   (thanks in advance)"
481693,misfish,2010-07-02 17:20:00,29133,Look into having a helicoil put in.CTC has them.Cheap do it yourself.
481694,Fish4Eyes,2010-07-02 17:22:00,1022,"That turn handle thingy can't be too expensive. I would just replace that, assuming the threading is ok. And stop reefing on it"
481695,TC1OZ,2010-07-02 17:23:00,987, Will have to stop by on the way home... Haven't seen anything like this before.  Thanks! I knew posting on here would get me more ideas!
481696,misfish,2010-07-02 17:26:00,29133,You could also just drop by any machanic shop and have them do it quick.
481697,TC1OZ,2010-07-02 17:28:00,987, $28 for the plastic replacement :   $78 for the metal replacement :   Not to mention taxes & shipping.  I only paid 100$ for the motor & battery.  I'm sure some other people have ideas too! But this helicoil looks like what I need.
481699,TC1OZ,2010-07-02 17:29:00,987, That's the only place I could find that sells the parts.... Anyone know of anything in Canada?
481703,Fish4Eyes,2010-07-02 17:47:00,1022,call aikmans and see if they have any parts trolling motors they can take it off of.
481706,DanD,2010-07-02 18:06:00,2223,Could you not MacGyver it and use an automotive hose clamp around the shaft above the stripped out collar?  Dan.
481708,fishinfool,2010-07-02 18:11:00,366,"Hey tc10z  http://www.helicoil.in/helicoil.htm   Check out this site so you know exactly what it is you are doing with the Helicoil. Don't overthink it, they are really easy to install just make sure you use the right sized bit for the coil you are installing.  Good Luck."
481710,TC1OZ,2010-07-02 18:14:00,987," You can... I mean I ""fixed"" it with duct tape, but its a hack job. And the hose clamp would for sure qualify as a hack job.  The main issue with that ""fix"" is when the boat is going with the engine the trolling motor will catch in the water and fly off to the end (possibly ripping off the controller)... Lots of adjustments to get it to operate safely that way.  I'd rather do it right (and cheap)."
481711,Fish Farmer,2010-07-02 18:17:00,2234,"Had the same thing happen to mine. I fixed it by installing a nut on the inside. Takes a little bit of work but mines better than new. You have to take the top off which is the control handle so you can get the clamp off. You disconnect the wires inside 1 black 1 red, 1 white 1 yellow. After clamp is off you take the insert out and the little piece that the thump screw pushes on. I took a electric soldering gun and melted a counter sink hole around were the thump screw comes through on the inside to fit a nut. I got a nut the same size and thread as the thump screw. Make sure you don't melt to much, a little at a time. Once I got a bit of a hole the size of the nut that the nut would stay I put the gun on the nut so the nut would melt into the plastic. I found a longer bolt the same size to help keep the nut in-line with the hole. The nut doesn't have to be right flush because there is enough play. I also knock the pin out of the tilting part, made it allot easier. If you live in Hamilton you could drop by I'd show you mine. They should have made them that way. A friend of mine has the same problem and I'm sure there's lot with the same thing. I'll post a wiring picture in a couple mins.        "
481713,TC1OZ,2010-07-02 18:28:00,987," Excellent. I read on several forums they send you the same part to replace it with... And even if I get the part back under warranty I think I'd rather do something like what you did. (since you have to take the head off the unit anyways)  I don't understand why they make the part like that... Its obvious that you need metal on metal... All it takes is one or two twists with pressure on the wrong angle and shes a goner!  I look forward to seeing your pictures! After I mow the lawn I'll have to get searching for a nut to fit the bolt and plug in the old soldering iron!  That helicoil looks like it can get expensive to buy the entire kit (more than the entire replacement of the transom mount).  I think the project will be fun, and at the end of the day if I totally screw it up I can just buy a new mount....."
481715,TC1OZ,2010-07-02 18:34:00,987,   Are we talking about the same part???  
481720,DanD,2010-07-02 18:44:00,2223, Sorry man; it was just a suggestion and yes not a great one; hence the MacGyver comment. LOL Dan.
481721,Fish Farmer,2010-07-02 18:45:00,2234,"Yes we are, Your lucky that you didn't lose the thump nut in the water like my buddy. I was luck as you, it stripped in my hand. Just watch you don't melt to much. that piece is thick where the thread is. Just go easy. I wish I could be there to help. I hope you understand what I posted. I'm going out to take a picture of mine, after shot. Be back in a couple Min's. Picture is a little blurry, see the the nut inside.       "
481723,TC1OZ,2010-07-02 18:50:00,987,"  You don't have to! I re-read your first post and I understand.  You were showing me the wires so that I could re-connect them again! I always bust out the digital camera if I have to disconnect something and it goes in a special order (or not obvious) or I lay the parts in the order in which I removed them.  Thanks again, I look forward to this little project!  I as well stripped mine in my hand, I was so angry I wanted to just chuck it but I was smart enough to ask my friend to kindly place it in my fishing gear!  "
481724,Fish Farmer,2010-07-02 19:10:00,2234,"Did you see the nut picture? I think my motor is a little older than yours ,but almost looks the same. Mines a 30 LB thrust, my pin looks a little heavier. I knock it out with a smaller bolt and hammer, mine came out pretty easy."
481725,TC1OZ,2010-07-02 19:21:00,987, Yes sir! Thanks again. I'll let you know how it goes tonight!
481727,archer379,2010-07-02 19:24:00,277,you could try a 2 part epoxy then drill and tap it
481729,Fish Farmer,2010-07-02 19:28:00,2234,"Good luck Bud, Now I got to get my   in gear, Spiel and myself are headin out Salmon fishin. Probably another post later, I hope with some fish"
481730,TC1OZ,2010-07-02 19:29:00,987, But you are still screwing a metal bolt into an epoxy/plastic thread.  With my beefy hands I'll strip it 10 times faster than I could do that repair!
481731,TC1OZ,2010-07-02 19:29:00,987, Good luck! I'm gonna post my report in the next couple of hours from my vacation. Stuck at work for now
481732,Twocoda,2010-07-02 19:45:00,4130,Give it some Viagra and it will go up ....but it might not go down for 4 hours...  Sorry couldnt resist...
481911,Fish Farmer,2010-07-03 13:34:00,2234, Didn't know what you meant. But I reread and it did make me laugh.
