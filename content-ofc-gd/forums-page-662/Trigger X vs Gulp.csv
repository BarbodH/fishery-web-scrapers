481430,FlyGuy5,2010-07-01 13:36:00,101,Trigger X all the way
481433,EC1,2010-07-01 15:07:00,930,"Never tried the spray by trigger x, and had only one experience with the gulp spray. I guess I would say the gulp spray works, but I'm not keen on the super watery formula.  In the plastics department though, Gulp takes it by far...Well, since I've only caught a couple of fish with TriggerX while Gulp is like my go to plastic."
481435,alexcba,2010-07-01 15:20:00,634,"never tried trigger x so i wont vote. i find gulp spray and plastics work great tho. i used to use berkley attractants with most soft plastics, and found that worked well when you stuff a little cotton in a tube jig or bullet weight on a worm harness just holds the scent longer. yet to try it with gulp but it'll happen this weekend."
