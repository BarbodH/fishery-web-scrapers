After a huge meal at The Mandarin to celebrate 2 kids graduating their respective schools, and a 3rd going off to start Ranger Camp, I was a bit stuffed, a lot lethargic, and not up to doing much that required movement. My wife was in a similar situation and just wanted to watch a movie, and suggested that I go and do a little fishing. I know of a great little spot on the Grand where some nice folks have stashed a couple of patio chairs, and excessive movement wouldn't really be an issue.  I arrived at the spot and saw more than the usual number of vehicles, so I figured spots may be at a premium, but lucked out as no one had grabbed the chairs!  I hooked up a bottom bouncer and worm, figured I'd drown him and see if any Cats, Bass, or Walleyes were in the neighbourhood, as I'd had some of each in the prior week. After the second drift down the channel, I got up to re-cast and resume my 'nap'. A nice guy a few feet over decided to take this as a chance to have a chat with me. While talking about the Holiday/work/etc I missed my target for the cast and ended up in a little backwater. Started bringing the rig back in, and thought I caught up on a submerged tree I was trying to avoid. Then the tree started head-shaking and heading into the channel!  Like I mentioned, I was not prepared for this. Ultra-light rod, 6LB line, no leader, no net... Oh, and I was standing on a steep bank 3' above the water. Crap! After 15 minutes of fighting, trying to get my phone out of my pocket for one of the guys that materialized to snap a picture (No camera either), sliding down the bank, and 5 good runs for deep water, I had a beauty pike at the bank, and she was finally tired. Instead of jumping into the water to grab her, I tried to lift her head out of the water with the rod so I could grab her behind the head.... Snap....  I've never heard 5 guys all yell the same expletive in such unison...  Well, despite the fish escaping before I could get a shot for posterity, and bragging rights, that was by far my best fish of the season. At least so far.  There are some really big pike in the Grand, and now I'm a believer...  And next time, I'm going fully equipped..."
