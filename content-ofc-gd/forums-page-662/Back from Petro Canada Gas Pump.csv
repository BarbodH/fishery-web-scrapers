481348,young_one,2010-07-01 01:25:00,620,"96.4 cents minus 2 cents off using Petro Credit Card The gas price tomorrow is 104.4 cents Price I paid 94.4 cents  $160 to fill up both car and boat, approximately 170L  $177 vs. $160 I saved $17 dollars fighting for gas and zigzagging through the gas war at the pump tonight.  Not a lot of money to some, but look at it this way, its 3 new fishing lures!"
481354,Fisherman,2010-07-01 01:39:00,7201,"Ya, it was a nuthouse at all 3 pumps in town today, Mac's ran out before lunch, No frills ran out of regular and sold the mid/premium at regular cost and the Pedrocan was lined up out to the road all day."
481357,danc,2010-07-01 01:43:00,4677,78.0 where I bought my gas today.
481360,mbosh1980,2010-07-01 01:48:00,349,topped up at 96 something at 6am today.  Didn't want to deal with the insane lineups I saw later.
481372,DRIFTER_016,2010-07-01 02:20:00,10439,  HST sucks!!!
481374,Duckie,2010-07-01 02:49:00,305,"I really don't understand how people will line up forever to save a few dollars filling up, when the HST, starting tonight at midnight, is here for good.  or, at least for a few years.  I'd rather spend that time fishing  it sucks, and we are all stuck with it"
481389,Mattones,2010-07-01 03:58:00,587,I was going by the Gas station and remembered to fill up! I pulled in as someone was leaving. The guy beside me was filling up his older viper!
481391,livinisfishin,2010-07-01 04:02:00,661,Hey danC where abouts are you paying 78c/l
481393,shan&jay,2010-07-01 04:27:00,55,im sure all the extra money generated from hst will be spent on a wothwile cause  instead of g20 riots there should have been hst riots but the government did a good job at keeping it under the radar im sure moast people never  knew about it  until a month ago like me  
481401,SBCregal,2010-07-01 07:12:00,688,i dunno where you gotta be to not know about it.  seems every time i turned on the radio somebody was talking about it.  it shouldnt come as a suprise at all i'd think.
481403,SlowPoke,2010-07-01 07:50:00,2984,"Paid 90.4 including 5 cent discount this morning. Saved a bunch on 165 lts in the Suburban considering my discount runs out at midnight + the 8%. I just wish I had the vent installed on the boat tank, I would have put in another 75 lts."
481416,musky66,2010-07-01 11:16:00,273,I'm sure some folk spent more in line idling than they saved at the pumps.
481434,BillM,2010-07-01 15:17:00,17367,Dan's buying fuel from the rez!!!   lol
481487,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-07-01 21:49:00,0,"How they can get away with implementing a massive tax increase like that I don't know. For real there should be a protest down town.  Not to mention now we have a vehicle tax of $60 a year to own a vehicle! Tax grab after tax grab after tax grab, when will the people say enough is enough here in Canada???"

481544,Fisherman,2010-07-02 01:24:00,7201, Why not ask how many voted Lieberal in the last election by a show of hands up.. or do you suspect there's going to be a lot of people with short arms right now.
481612,JimC,2010-07-02 10:20:00,86,"  Oct 11th, 2011, is the date for the next Ontario provincial election .. mark your calender; I did, and I bet a lot of other Ontarians have as well.  I wonder how many folks know that Dalton McGuinty's HST Tax grab on the following four items, are exempted in British Columbia's HST rules, namely:  1. Hydro    2. Home Heating    3. Gasoline and   4. Rec activites like Golf (that was the last straw for me).  btw,  I filled up on Tuesday at a Kitchener Petro Canada and cost of reg. was 92.2 ... this morning ... 102.0    so that's 7.5 cemts for Dalton and another 2.3 cents for PetroCan.   What a joke"
481832,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-07-03 01:37:00,0, Do you think it really maters who you vote in whether Liberal or PC?? Name one politician that was elected that didn't funnel money into their pockets?
481836,CLofchik,2010-07-03 02:10:00,854,   Happy Canada's Day...now bend over while we kick you in the teeth.
