481682,Spiel,2010-07-02 16:26:00,9065,I'm heading out of the canal launch (Hamilton) later this afternoon with Fish Farmer. Anyone got any tips or starting points after the big blow?
481687,tonyb,2010-07-02 16:50:00,1637,"The surface temps are chilly, so you may not mark many fish as they will likely be near the surface.  Fish in the the 35-60 foot depths anywhere from 80 feet to 150 feet fow and if you find baitfish, work the area over  There were some crazy currents out there yesterday, so if you have a depth probe use it to determine the direction of the current and troll into or with it to keep the lures from being blown to one side or the other.  If you don't have a depth probe, just try different directions until you hookup and then repeat what works.  May see you out there after work today.  Tony"

481834,John,2010-07-03 01:58:00,2956, So how did you do???
481841,Spiel,2010-07-03 02:42:00,9065,"Well we didn't get skunked. Nothing big landed, though I had my chance with a big ass rainbow that made a fool of me. I believe it was 5 boated for 7 on.  Fish Farmer may have a few pics of the little ones we kept for the BBQ."
481843,Roy,2010-07-03 02:47:00,13728,WTG!!!!! Don't tell chessy though.
481983,Joey,2010-07-03 18:17:00,9122,"Wow, Spiel caught fish!!!!!  "
