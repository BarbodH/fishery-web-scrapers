So we're google mapping lakes that are close to my parents new house in case I'm able to convince Ginny to head out in the boat for a couple of hours tomorrow.... Has anybody ever fished Whitson lake or Onwatin lakes?  Would 1 or the other be worth a short trip?  I'm looking at Whitson because there's a beach for the kids, but Onwatin is closer by and smaller, which means the fish could be easier to find! hah  We got a new potty for Averie for the boat, and she tested it out on our 7 hour ride north! hahaha no more peeing in a bucket!   K9's Ridding Coach!   Northern ontario sunset   Northern Ontario wildlife haha   And a northern ontario fire - Man I LOVE being here.   Any advice on local lakes from local folks would be great, otherwise I'll just post what happens!  Hope everybody had a great Canada Day and enjoy your weekend!  Cheers, Ryan & Family"
