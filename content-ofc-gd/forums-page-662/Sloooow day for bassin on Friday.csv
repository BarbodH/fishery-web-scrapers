481963,splashhopper,2010-07-03 16:28:00,2931,"Dang, I was all pumped up to go fishing on my favorite lake on Friday with my friend Dutchy.  I was sooooo pumped that i woke up at 3:30am  Finally fell back asleep and then woke up late.  Had picked up my ""new to me"" 12 foot tinnie the evening before and was looking forward to cruising around looking for bass and pike.  I should have known the fishing was gonna be poor when i discovered that my little boat had a leak in it... and we were not even in the boat yet!   Oh well, I do grouting for a living and had plenty of sponges to keep dutchy busy!  Five hours later and we only had a couple of taps on the heavy worms and two blow ups on the top water.( nothing hooked though)  On our final lap around, we came across Spinnerbaitking and his friend. ( the ""highlight"" of the day )  Being new to car topping a tinny, i soon learned that if you have a leak in the boat, you want to be at the bow of the boat when you flip it over, or at least taller than the guy who is helping you  . Got a good soaker.  lol Dutchy damned near dropped the boat, he was laughing so hard   lol  The real hilight of the day was seeing a reminder of a simpler way of life as we were leaving.  ( can you say- "" the lucky sperm club""    )"
