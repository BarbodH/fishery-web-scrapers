481437,pikeie,2010-07-01 15:25:00,380,"Hey everyone! ive been having a great year on LOTW agian, i cant belive how fast this summer is going by! The fishing was interesting the first few weeks of the year with the really warm weather we were experiencing. We had to change our tactics and patterns to what we would be using and where we would be fishing further on in the season. Once i found the fish ive been on them ever since! the walleye bite has been fantastic with many fish in the high 20's and many numbers, some days boating over 200 walleye or more. The early serson northens were fairly slow because of the warm water i missed the really shallow water fishing. But ive still boated quite a few over 40"".                    And since muskie opend just a week ago ive been out targeting them qutie a bit and so far ive caught 5 this year i only have pictures of three of them at this moment lol but most of them have been small all around 40"".      This is my biggest so far this year, i hooked it but let the kid bring her to the boat! you should of seen the look on his face when he saw this beast! this was also his first muskie! not a bad way to start lol      Anyways i hope you guys and girls enjoyed some of these pictures! Hope all of you have a good summer, ill post back as much as i can.  Matt"
