481324,danbouck,2010-07-01 00:07:00,4380,That's weird!  I've had rock bass swim after cleaning them but that's only when you do a perfect job
481325,Spiel,2010-07-01 00:08:00,9065,"LMAO off at, and I quote, ""the fish is moving but it's dead."" Okay......"
481328,pike n' whities,2010-07-01 00:22:00,131,that's so....... creepy. hahaha.
481333,Burtess,2010-07-01 00:36:00,901,I just barfed in my mouth a bit.....  Burt
481335,g_clot,2010-07-01 00:43:00,104,"I just showed my girlfriend, I've never seen her laugh so awkwardly..."
481336,Guest gbfisher,2010-07-01 00:44:00,0,Must have been the lemon. ouch....
481339,Pigeontroller,2010-07-01 00:54:00,2793,Kill 'em again!!!
481340,Leecher,2010-07-01 00:58:00,7832,Must be when she added salt that triggered a reaction Don't think I'd eat any of it
481351,mbosh1980,2010-07-01 01:31:00,349,that was moderately horrifying
481359,lunkerbasshunter,2010-07-01 01:46:00,2585,ok that was disturbing yet Im still giggling about it haha  Cheers!
481381,Cookslav,2010-07-01 03:23:00,1457,"Dogfish?...more like Zombiefish. Yup, I'm gonna have nightmares now LOL!"
481384,alexcba,2010-07-01 03:32:00,634,thats wild!  now was that a dog fish from the shark family or a bowfin? i didnt think people ate bowfin.. saw one get opened up and that thing stunk to high hell.
481387,Cudz,2010-07-01 03:48:00,2652,"She sounded like she was from liverpool or Manchester or Further north in England, Maybe Newcastle (I shouldn't guess).  Limeyangler would know.  I think maybe it is more the shark dogfish than a bowfin.  Maybe it is a common name in england for another type of fish"
481397,gdelongchamp,2010-07-01 04:54:00,199,"I wonder, will they still wiggle after frying them?  If you cut them in half will all the individual pieces continue to wiggle ?  Never mind, I don't want to know the answers to those questions.  Yeah, that would turn me off to eating those things."
481408,alphaalpha,2010-07-01 09:12:00,475,I never had much desire to eat one of those in the first place but that definately sealed the deal.
481409,mbosh1980,2010-07-01 09:43:00,349, Except zombies die once you remove the head or destroy the brain! Maybe the movies have it all wrong...Great now I need to rethink my zombie plan!
481418,NAW,2010-07-01 12:09:00,4022,I was looking forward to eating some fish this weekend...Now....Not so much..
481427,fisherman7,2010-07-01 12:48:00,325,I'm going to barf! Call a priest!!!!!
481579,bigfish1965,2010-07-02 03:10:00,3382,I think it was just small currents of electricity in the foil which was triggering the obviously very fresh fish nerve endings.
481684,mpt,2010-07-02 16:38:00,158,If the aluminum foil is over an electric stovetop burner any fresh fish will do that. When the electric burners first came out there was a big problem with fresh frog legs. People were getting hurt.
481737,Twocoda,2010-07-02 20:07:00,4130,Great !!!!!!! just freaking GREAT!!!!!!!!!! back to sleeping with a night light again ...
481900,limeyangler,2010-07-03 12:58:00,5204," definitely Liverpool or Manchester area accent as you say Cudz.  So since there are no bowfin that i have ever heard of or seen in the UK,  those are definitely the shark type Dogfish tails (i've skinned and ate a few myself...they never did that though)   This is the fishy right here   "
