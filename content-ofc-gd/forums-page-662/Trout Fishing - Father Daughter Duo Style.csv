481459,Leecher,2010-07-01 19:06:00,7832,"What a great way to celebrate my 47th today by sharing the shoreline with my daughter   The plan was to get Mélissa into her first trout and she manage to land it     When I woke up.... temperature was 11C with a 13km/h wind from the West and 100% humidity.... perfect  Left home at 6:00am and got to destination around 7:45am.... right away rigged my daughter's rod with a floating jig and worm, mine with a dropshot type rig with 2 hooks and worm.  Here's Mélissa manning the fort while waiting for the byte    Here she is with her very first speckle.... real proud of her    and of course I got into the action too    The next pic I thought I had hooked into the biggest trout    Red horse..... man did it ever put up a great fight  Around noon we called it a day and head back home. We went 3 for 10 and spent quality time together   PRICELESS Hope you enjoy Leechman"
481462,tjsa,2010-07-01 19:16:00,1578,"Great stuff Jacques, glad you and your daughter got out. Small specks are always great to catch."
481464,BigGuppy,2010-07-01 19:20:00,19,"Good for you man. That's one of the best parts of fishing for me, spending time with the kids. We don't have a boat but it's great sitting on the shore. It's always funny when my daughter comes. She's 3 and within 10 minutes she's off chasing a butterfly or picking flowers or something!!! Looks like u had great day."
481466,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-07-01 19:22:00,0,that last fish is a trout!  it's a whistling trout! looks like a fine day!

481481,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-07-01 21:13:00,0,"Sounds like a birthday well spent. Should try fishing near that cauldron, if there is water flow, there should be some decent brookies hanging around there. Thanks for sharing."

481565,Leecher,2010-07-02 02:29:00,7832, Thanks Johnny!!! On the left hand side of the cauldron is a 30' drop off but the wind today was blowing toward where we were..... bringing lots of bait fish on shore. That is why I decide to setup there. Very good point and will keep it in mind for future outings   Thanks TJ!!!   Thanks COPPER!!!   I have a pretty good idea   Thanks Jim!!! Today was a blessing in itself and I'm glad my daughter join me.... so proud of her   Thanks Joey!!!   Thanks splashhopper!!!   Thanks Victor!!!

I had a similar experience with my nephew on Father's Day - he's 6 and caught his first ever trout - a 8"" brown!  Cheers Ryan"
