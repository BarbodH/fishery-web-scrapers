( that picture does not do the fish justice at all)  Then our friend was up with a bunch.  I was ill prepared and brought the wrong rod ( stiff bass rod  )  Our buddy lent me his old 6""light action rod and I was soon in on the action as well.  The two-way radio was going all morning with limits being caught at different depths.  I guess it was the perch god's giving us all a break after the dreaded HST kicking the day before.  These were biggest perch I have ever seen that didn't come from a grocery store!   All in all, we filled a 5 gallon pail with jumbos and had a nice little meal that night.    Can't wait for the pickerel run on Erie..."

482138,GoneFishin,2010-07-04 06:09:00,349,Nice catch. I had the chance to fish them 4 years ago out there and it was crazy. We were pulling up 3 jumbos at a time on pickeral rigs! I'm hoping to go out again really soon.
