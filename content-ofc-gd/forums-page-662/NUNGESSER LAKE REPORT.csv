467137,kgeary,2010-05-17 12:55:00,82,"Weekly fishing and weather report (SCROLL DOWN TO SEE THE LATEST REPORTS AND PICTURES)   MAY 22-29 CONTINUED GOOD WEATHER AND FISHING TONY SCHAEFER AND HIS GROUP CATCHING SOME BIG PIKE Sunday they had two 40 inch pike a 41 and a 43. will post pics soon TONY NOVALONY AND HIS GROUP HAD A BUNCH OF 25-28 INCH WALLEYE OFF EAGLE POINT. pics soon  JOHN BACHBURGER AND GROUP HAD AT LEAST ONE 40 INCH PIKE AND SOME BIG WALLEYE.  HAYDEN, SEANNA AND BRADY CAUGHT A BUNCH OF GIANT WALLEYE EVEN SOME RIGHT OFF THE DOCK. I took the kids out for a few hours. Seanna had a 25 incher within the first 30 seconds. She ended up and with a HUGE walleye Hayden caught a 29 incher. They've both caught several over 30 in the past but still get a thrill out of these big walleye.     Haydens friend Brady caught his largest pike ever.     Then after supper they caught a bunch off the dock. It was a great day.        Thursday, May 20, 2010 MAY 15-22 -HOT WEATHER HOT BITE  So far the walleye seem to be in all the typical spots. Definitely ahead of past years but just think of what the fishing would be like a few weeks ahead and you won't have any problem. The Dragon flies came out Wednesday, the Tiger Swallowtail Butterflies (Yellow butterfly for short) are out. So that means????___that the shiners will spawn in a few days. Which means???____that the pike and walleye will be in the shallow reeds near creek mouths. Have fun. Any black flies will be quickly taken care of by the dragon flies. Of course there are almost zero mosquitoes here on the island because it is all sand so there is no standing water which equals no mosquittoes. yahoo!!!   RON AND DAN CONTINUE TO HAMMER THEM Greens narrows, Eagle nest and all over North bay are loaded with 24 -26 inch walleye in 3-10 feet of water. Of course there are plenty of littles one as well. Thursday afternoon Ron landed a beautiful 40 inch pike, which he pulled out of the edge of the reed line. Then in the evening Ron got a nice 38 inch pike. Carl had a HUGE walleye follow his rapala just like a Pike he figures it was well over 30 inches. The guys continue to catch lots of walleye right close to camp.         DIXIE MOORE CATCHES THE LARGEST PIKE OF HER LIFE. Dixie Moore caught a 43 inch Pike, her largest pike ever. I wish we had it on video from the stories they told and the excitement still bubbling over when they returned for dinner I'm sure the video would have been fun to watch. There were several good comments, apparently the fun started when they went for the net and realized it was hanging nicely in the cabin and then something about throwing the ___ needle nose pliers overboard. Then there was all that blood on the floor of the boat (and it wasn't the fishes). See that great smile in the picture? It was still there when they left camp (without their rod case) and will most likely still be there when Dixie gets back to Iowa. I wouldn't be surprised if she sends that photo to the nice lady at the DesMoines Register.         Cal Wicklander has been fishing Canada for 30 years and was amazed by the number of big walleye. His comment "" where I used to fish I caught hundreds of 15 inch walleye. At Anglers Kingdom I can't remember catching ONE that small., What a walleye lake"".  MAY 15  Beautiful weather, fish biting but hardly any guests. Everyone was too worried about a late ice out and didn'w want to commit to the 15th. Ice went out APRIL 16 Here is a pic of some ice piled up on the island the day the ice went out.   Hayden caught a nice big Momma about 10 minutes into the season    Hayden has already been swimming.    A big difference from May 15 2009      so we're about a month ahead of schedule according to the weather and natures calendar. The yellow pollen from Jackpine trees is already on the water, Poplar leaves are out. The Dragon Fly nymphs are near shore and should be emerging soon, the Yellow Tiger tail butterflies should be out in a few days as well.  The walleye are in 3 -15 feet and pretty well all over the lake. The water is about 2 feet below normal and about 4 feet below last fall. It will be an interesting year fishing wise.  We have two groups arriving today and will start fishing in ernest.   I will try to keep you updated as the season progresses."

467154,solopaddler,2010-05-17 13:22:00,8605,How about the pike? Are they still in the shallows near the creek mouths?  What are water temps?
467501,kgeary,2010-05-18 12:59:00,82,"   The water temps are already in the high 50 low 60s pike and walleye still in 2-3 feet but alos out in 10 even 15 feet.   Dave had a 28 inch walleye and Dans group had a bunch of 24-27 inch walleye in 3-8 feet. ""couln't keep em off"" was his comment."

Monday- June 14 was clear and calm by all accounts the fishing was slow However the Walleye Wizard continued to hammer the walleye, boating about 75. Not bad for a slow post cold front day.

Tom Bangert, Kurt Brueninig and Mike Enge “We didn't catch 3 fish under 23 inches today and we caught over 50. The three of us probably caught 150 over 23 inches this week the biggest was 26. Hundreds of smaller ones. mostly 12 to 20 feet once in a while we'd get one in 8 the ""S -turn"" was the most productive. the Biggest came from north of ""The Wall"" All along the face of that bay every pass And if didn't get a bite all I had to do is start the motor It was fun, we spent all day there and it was out of the wind (wind was East and South) Even in these nice big boats I didn't want to be out in the wind today.""  Wednesday June 16- Overcast with some rain in the afternoon. Water temp at 65 F. Calm to some strong winds. Ken Nichols I just wanted to drop you a note and thank you for a great week at Angler's Kingdom. We found the staff to be courteous and attentive. The boats were large and well equiped and the fishing was excellent. John and I have been going to lodges in the states and Canada since 1984 and you are the first that actually gave us a guided tour of the lake. I am trying to get my son-in-law and another buddy to join us on our next trip. Thanks again and have a successful season.  Thursday June 17 Steady winds from the east.

Have a good season!  Todd DeMoss    Fairly good weather with water temperature at an average 65 F. One minute you have the sun blasting at you and the next, it's raining. But that did not deter the fishing up here. Phil Roede caught a 43'' pike right off the dock here at camp. He also caught a 39 and 40 on the same day within 10 minutes apart. Everyone else did very good averaging 30-40 walleye a day per group. We had a full house this week.   "
