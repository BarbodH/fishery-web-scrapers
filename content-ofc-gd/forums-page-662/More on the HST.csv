481837,JohnF,2010-07-03 02:11:00,3494," You ever heard what they say about assumptions? Apparently not.  Well listen up and I'll give you the quick lesson in HST. The HST is going to hurt my business as much or more than any business in Ontario. I am not pleased that it's been done but smarter people than me (and  obviously you) have determined that in the big picture it actually is good for most businesses. That's not to say it's going to be great for the consumer. I've taken the trouble to research it and now I get it. You on the other hand are apparently happy to follow the braying crowd and spout second hand opinions you haven't bothered to research or understand.  I'm saying we should all suck it up because we're stuck with it. It's a done deal and we've got to live with it. The alternative is to sound like a bumbling idiot who has no idea of what he's really talking about but since a lot of other people including politicians are saying it let's jump on the bandwagon and look cool. You're living proof that partisan obfuscation works. Call me out when you've taken the time to understand the problem.

482123,John Bacon,2010-07-04 04:20:00,3277, The increase in fuel costs does not really effect businesses.  The extra 8% tax that they pay is simply deducted from the tax that they have to remit to the government.  For example if gas was previously $1.05 a litre including GST and has now increased to $1.13 a litre including HST.  They previously would have deducted the $0.05 / litre from the GST they remitted so the effective cost to them was $1.00 per litre.  Now they will deduct $0.13 / litre from the HST they submit to the goverment so the effective cost to them is $1.00 / litre.  Consumers get stuck paying the extra $0.08 on our gas.  One of the impacts of the HST is to shift tax from business to consumers.
482128,John Bacon,2010-07-04 04:36:00,3277," 1.) There was no double, triple, etc. taxation on PST as it was only paid by the end user.  I.e. we paid PST on the cars we bought but the dealers didn't have to pay PST when they purchased a car from Ford or GM. 2.) Manufacturing equipment was already exempt from PST.  So Ford and GM never had to pay PST on the equipment that they purchased for their assembly lines. 3.) Ford, GM, and their dealers used to pay PST on office furniture.  Now they won't have to.  The PST that they paid on furniture purchased before July 1st will not be refunded; they just won't have to pay it on furniture purchased after July 1st.  The savings will not be immediate, and they won't be 40% of the cost of a car.  p.s.  When Nike introduced their Pegasus model running shoe 25 years ago it sold for approximately $110 pair.  Now after 25 years of inflation it sells for about $110 pair.  It would appear that Nike has in fact passed some of their savings on to us."

482237,DRIFTER_016,2010-07-04 16:44:00,10439, Actually they just shifed production to China and lowered quality. So you are paying the same for a product of lesser quality. The lesser quality means that the product will wear out sooner and you will need to replace it sooner. So if the new off shore manufactured product lasts half as long as the previous higher quality product you will actually be paying twice as much for the same longevity. So your new shoes are actually $220 for the equivilent of the 25 year old ones.
482251,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-07-04 17:03:00,0," Who benefits? The same people that own your government. The wealthy. They are making ridiculous amounts of profit, making things dirt cheap in China, and selling it for top dollar in North America. Its like shooting yourself in the foot, I agree, but investors no longer care about long term investments. Its about making quick returns(overnight) on your investments.

482259,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-07-04 17:10:00,0," This says it all....  To be more precise, its shifting tax from the provincial funds(P.S.T)(which is the people's tax money)to the businesses. Basically the businesses are getting more of the consumers(tax payers) money. And the provincial government is getting less. Which means less money for the government for stuff like social programs, health care, ect..."
482261,Governator,2010-07-04 17:12:00,879,"I've been a small business owner for 6 years.  This HST hurts us badly.  I don't do cash jobs, I'm 100% legit across the board.  We pay the GST (Now HST) that we bill our clients each quarter to the Government.  Put it this way, if I do $30K in sales in a 3 month period I have to write a GST cheque for $1500 to the Government of what we invoiced out, not collected.  Now we have to pay $3900 on the same sales.  Basically without a cushion of money in the bank it makes it difficult for small business to make these payments on time.  On top of that our quotes now are obviously higher unless we lower our own cost to balance it out to the customer.  It's a lose lose for my business and I don't see how we benefit.  Just creates added stress and less profits."

Well, it seems to me the best thing for us all to do right now is suck it up and move on. If you feel really strongly about it express yourself in the next election. But pay close attention to the promises the other parties are making about rescinding this tax. I have a pretty good hunch they won't be doing anything like that.  Yeah, it sucks that I have to collect an extra 8% or $800 on a $200,000 sale assuming a commission rate of 5%. Keep in  mind though that there is no set commission rate in Ontario so I suspect a lot of smarter realtors aren't going to blow a listing for a few hundred bucks. Commissions have always been negotiable before and now we just have one more factor to throw into the negotiating equation.  And as for new homes, at least under $400,000 there's a pretty substantial rebate in place. Eventually if the builders play fair most of the extra should actually disappear. Naturally some of them will take advantage of the circumstances to pad the profit margin and let the govt take the heat for it.  The long and short of it is that all the pissing and moaning in the world won't make the new tax go away. The provincial govt is stuck with it and so are we.  As much as it pains me to admit it the new tax is probably the right way to go. It's about time the governments started paring away some of the bureaucratic lard. Now, once we get used to it, we'll just have one tax collection infrastructure instead of two and for many of us with deductible expenses it'll one day be to our advantage. Talk to some of the business people you know. Odds are pretty good they'll tell you they like the tax for a whole bunch of reasons.  Don't let the politicians wind you up against the other party over something they themselves wouldn't change and almost certainly would have had to do themselves if they'd been in power. In reality the extra tax is really only on a limited number of things that weren't already subject to the two taxes.  If you want to put some heat on somebody over this start asking some of the product suppliers if they're reducing prices to reflect the provincial tax change. How many products will you be paying the new tax on when the price you're paying still includes the 8% from the old tax collection system?  Sorry if I've let any of you down with my lack of angst but I'm just grinning and bearing it. It's not great right now but it's nowhere near as horrible as some of the opposition politicians and special interest groups would have you believe.  JF"

I also see more places willing to talk $$$ and getting away from using the cash register. On that note I was talking to a older girl this week about her small place that she runs and to see how this would help her in her eyes it does not help her and the first thing she had to do was fork out more $$$ on a new cash register then make up all new cards for her place as the old ones had gst/pst spots and so much more.

481588,John Bacon,2010-07-02 03:33:00,3277," The savings would apply to items that purchase that are not for re-sale; i.e. computers, tools, shelves, etc.  Businesses are general exempt from paying PST on goods that they purchase for resale but they do have to pay PST on good that they buy for use by the business.  These will effectively be tax free because of input tax credits.  In theory, the businesses will pass these savings on to the consumer by lowering their prices."
481613,cynmar,2010-07-02 11:02:00,169,"  Not sure I agree because I don't see any government paring down, I believe it was the PS.T. department that not only kept their jobs moving to the HST section but their union got them a nice fat severance pay because they lost their job with P.S.T. prior to going to work the next day under the H.S.T. Didn't even move their damn chair. Now that is just wrong. I see a lot of service companies are going to either lose revenue or be faced with decreased profits and the associated cuts. I own a janitorial company and we are faced with no increases. In some cases, we have been asked to eat the increase in tax, as prior to July we only charged G.S.T. Decrease in profit, no investment in equipment , employment to training.!! Growth stagnates. I know I am sounding extreme and as you say the other parties are no different. We have to look at a different regime where people expect less from the government and we can perhaps force them to pare themselves down.  Bill"

If companies passed down the savings Nike would be selling shoes for 15 dollars because of all the money they saved getting children in sweat shops to do the work for basically nothing.  Did the prices of cars drop 40 percent on the first?

Therefore the new pst component of the HST is a tax on a tax like the GST has been all along.  As for who you voted for - does it really matter? Is there any reason to think the politicians with the red flag or the orange one or whatever will treat us any more fairly. Remember this new tax has come about through the complicity of a red party at one level and a blue party at another. It's all about politicial party obfuscation. Is there any logic to saying we should all vote Liberal federally and PC provincially? Can the two levels of party really be seen as different entities with diametrically opposed ideologies. The Ontario Libs will wear the horns for this HST when in fact it was the PC's that imposed it through what amounted to financial blackmail to the tune of billions in transfer payments. I'm not pro-Liberal here but I'm not sure it's fair to lay all the blame on them. They may just be making the best of a bad situation. By that I mean looking for ways to get more money out of us while pointing the finger at the Canadian PC's for making it happen.

If we weren't going to be paying more through the HST, we would be paying more income tax - it is as simple as that.  Until the govvernment, whether it be Liberal, NDP or conservative can figure out a way to control spending, the only other alternative is to increase taxes or other revenues (fines etc.).  There is a spending problem somewhere along the lines, but no government wants to cut services to save money. A huge percentage of the budget is healthcare - no government will cut service there. Public sector wages - nope, unions are too powerful. Education - get a life, the teachers will go mad if wages are cut.  The HST is a necessary evil with the way spending is out of control. In the purest form it is just another way to redistribute wealth. Those that make more, spend more and will pay more tax, both HST and income tax. Those tax revenues are then used to pay for social programs and healthcare that benefit all levels of income earners.  Yes, the result is some things are now taxed more heavily, but for the majority of items, the tax rate stays the same - it is just the more popular items that people use more of (e.g. gas and heating oil) that get the most attention. For most people the impact is probably smaller than a 0.5% increase in income tax would be (though I doubt there'd be nearly as much backlash about income tax rates going up 0.5%)  Am I happy about the HST - no way, but unfortunately there is no way to stop it. The Liberals will get voted out over it, that's certain, but I guarantee no other government will come in and repeal it without an offseting increase in income taxes."

481826,Dutch,2010-07-03 01:09:00,831," The only thing you can do with the underground economy is report the offenders.  Many that partake are not the kind of people you would want doing business anyway.  If they cut corners on taxes, just think of the corners they cut in actually doing the job!  The underground econ. costs us all money as it takes tax revenue directly from healthcare and everything else legitimate taxpayers support.  The underground econ. is the reason our taxes are so high as it is.  All the government has to do is introduce rewards for reporting these people and we would be further ahead.  If everyone were to legitimately pay the taxes they owe, we wouldn't be in the situation we are in with such high income and excise taxes.  Next time anyone says they will accept cash, you should get a discount of at least 40%, not just the 13% HST.  Think about the income taxes the fraudster is saving as well.  We should have a forum on OFC to report underground econ. to Michael Brown - I'm sure he would be interested in paying a visit to unscroupulous business owners."
