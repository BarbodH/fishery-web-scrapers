What to do.Lloyd grabbed a rod and a lure to fish then with no luck.Spincast tried to reach in,I said no!

Anyway we headed off and shortly into the trip we hit fish,more fish, and more fish!It was awesome!Weve all done 5 rounds with a couple big chinnys and bows.The largest was julies at 21 or so lbs.Congrats on that one!If Im right 29 fish in total. Ill let the rest continue with the story! Thank you kindly Lloyd for a great day out,as well as spincast,frankie65 and his wife. I had a blast today with you guys.This one I will never forget!

482036,vinnimon,2010-07-03 23:48:00,2593,  The porn is coming very soon!And right now I feel like im rolling over waves in my chair.First time ever!
482038,Marko,2010-07-03 23:50:00,854,Glad to hear that you guys had a good fishing day and lots of fish caught. If Port Hope was not so far i would have joined on one of those trips for sure. I can relate to dropping keys in the water. One day i was fishing off this bridge and dropped all my keys in. It was about 5 feet deep and took me 20 minutes to snag them with a small mepps haha.  Looking forward to pics!
482042,vinnimon,2010-07-03 23:56:00,2593,"Gotta few for team 1,pics are fuzzy in the camera.I think the lense was slimmed!1 bow and 1 chinny to enter."

482106,asdve23rveavwa,2010-07-04 02:38:00,2690,"I will post a full report including lots of pics tomorrow...too tired right now.  Was a pleasure meeting both Vinnimon and Spincast (Vince and Rick)...always a great time with Lloyd, the amount of fish hooked, caught, and some released was bonus.  Glad it was you that brought up the being late and dropping the keys, Vince, LOL!!!  Things happen for a reason sometimes, and, Juli looked at it as the chain of events that led to her catching her PB Chinook today. Heading to bed, big report tomorrow, while some fish is on the smoker!!!!!!"
482107,bigugli,2010-07-04 02:48:00,6138,They don't usually hold up a man sized fistful of keys. My cousin lost his in 150' of water.
482151,Roy,2010-07-04 10:29:00,13728,"OK OK cut to the chase....where are the pics? And you arrive a half hour late, drop your keys in the water then expect all the others to wait while you retrieve your keys? You gotta know that many lesser dudes would have left you there Vin."
482188,asdve23rveavwa,2010-07-04 13:13:00,2690,"Hang on there, Roy...I'm working on the post right now.  You want pics, I've got about 20 of them loading to photobucket as I'm typing this.  Vince is never going to hear the end of the late/key incident, lol!  All worked out in the end."
