481548,Joey,2010-07-02 01:41:00,9122,"That's great, wonder if we saw you out there.  Looking forward to the pics.  We got 3 so obviously did not fish in the same spot, or we were there at different times as they were not so plentiful for us.  Joey"
481559,icefisherman,2010-07-02 02:13:00,952,"  OK, just to add the ""supporting photo material"" as George has summed it up nicely . Just one small correction (George is forgiven here)  but the big ones and most of the fish caught today were Chinooks (not Cohos). You can see that on the photos bellow. Next time we'll start with a on shore crush course on ""recognizing your fish"" first For someone who doesn't do this (like me bi-weekly)  he sure did great fighting some pretty good size monsters All big ones went back in the drink swimming nicely only kept few smaller ones that are now in the brine for tomorrow smoking session Anyhow - enjoy ....pictures don't do enough justice to those nice/silver/healthy fish....       Cheers, Ice Fisherman"

481685,icefisherman,2010-07-02 16:43:00,952," Nice seeing you at the launch Tony...tried calling you on your cell to see how you were doing during the day but couldn't reach you...oh well...next time, the show is just starting  Cheers, IceFisherman"
481738,Twocoda,2010-07-02 20:16:00,4130,Nice shootin ....the lamprey mark on the side of the one fish leads me to believe there is a lamprey problem from other posts as well  the fight of a healthy chinny is one of the best feelings in the world!!!...now if it HAD of been a Coho as stated ....that might have topped the chinny especially at that size  Good on ya !!!
