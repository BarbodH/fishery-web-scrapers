481515,Joey,2010-07-01 23:24:00,9122,"Nice to have a day off and celebrate Canada Day the way it should be celebrated, outside and fishing  Headed out from Oakville and as we are just about to leave harbour to go onto the big lake we hear someone yell ""PAUL"" from shore, it was Peter (Biteme)!  Motored over and had a nice chat with him.  Offered to take him out but he said he had ""chores"" LOL.  Fishing was pretty slow, but I managed a nice 28 incher.      She had a nasty hitchhiker, who didn't live to see another day          Then Paul got a little shaker.      Peter warned us that there were lots of shakers and that most of the time it was hard to tell they were even on.  We fished for a few more hours with nothing and then Paul reeled in all the lines and sure as Pete said, one had a shaker on.  Don't even know how long it was on for.    Anyhow, Fish - meet my BBQ        Happy Canada Day everyone!!  Joey"
