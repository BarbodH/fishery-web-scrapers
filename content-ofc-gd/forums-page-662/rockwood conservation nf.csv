482003,ironstone74,2010-07-03 20:24:00,201,"I used to work at Rockwood, the lake is a little small and very scenic.  The caves are cool but not all that much to them to explore.  There is a large pothole in the rock in the bush behind the caves which is worth the hike to check out. Nice beach and hiking trails.  They used to stock the lake with rainbows; I don't know if they still do...  Paul"
