521892,brifishrgy,2010-11-21 03:16:00,559,I started fishing the river again after 15 ish years and I notice a ton of garbage lying around and remembered the last couple years someone had organized a creek cleanup. Is it happening this year? if no one has brought it up yet is anyone interested in going down and cleaning it up for a couple hours?
521893,irishfield,2010-11-21 03:21:00,26272,tonyb was involved.. PM him maybe??!
521899,brifishrgy,2010-11-21 03:39:00,559," sent him a pm, If I remember right (doesn't happen very often) he did it one year then someone else did it last year , did a forum search back to around the same time last year but didn't come up with anything."

522213,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-11-22 13:18:00,0,so did you just become this years organizer?
522236,cuzza,2010-11-22 15:42:00,467," Not sure if that was directed at me? I saw this on another forum a while back - unfortunately I couldn't make it this time, if there's another one, I'd happily lend a hand for a few hours.
