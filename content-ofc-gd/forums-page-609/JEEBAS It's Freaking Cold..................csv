We hopped into the car with the outside temp hovering at -28 degrees.  :woot: We left the main road and traveled 5 KMs down a side road where we turned onto a 4X4 trail and drove for another 4.5 KMs through some pretty challenging obstacles before parking and heading down a quad/snowmachine trail on foot for the final kilometer of the journey. I wish I had photos of the one sketchy spot I had to negotiate. My buddy said I had about an inch of clearance between the front bumper and ground and my passenger back wheel was in the air while decending and I heard my trailer hitches draw bar hit the ground when I pulled up and out of the ravine.      This is what greeted us at the end of the trail.    I think we landed about 10 or 12 decent lakers between 2 and 4 pounds or so (nothing big but we lost another 15 or more) and my buddy had one pike in the 10# plus range on for a second. Seems I took a lot more pictures of my buddy than I got of me. The hot lures were airplane jigs and white tube jigs tipped with shiner minnows.              We kept 3 for the table and put the rest back.      It was an excellent day and we were comfortable in my 2 man cube with my 14,000 btu sunflower style Mr. Heater cranking. I don't think we would have lasted an hour without it. The wind started to blow about 20 kmh around 1:00 and the wind chill would have been in the -40 range. We got back to the truck after the sun had set and air temp was -29C. We were fishing in 18 to 20 feet and had 4-5 inches of ice under us.  As I'm sitting here in my living room watching the Leafs game on the big screen I'm still not thawed out and I'v been home for an hour and a half!!!!  I can't wait until next weeks adventure!!!"
521860,irishfield,2010-11-21 01:29:00,26272,Very Nice Dave !! Hope we don't have to drill for fish for a little while down here though...
521901,Carp,2010-11-21 03:43:00,1488,Very nice lakers. Good eating size. Mmmm.  -28 C Wow !!!
521912,WeedLine,2010-11-21 06:55:00,322,"Thanks for the report. Now I want to go icefishing. Can't wait. I never caught a laker so shallow trough the ice. Do you usually fish in those depths up north or is it a good early ice pattern only? Anyways, thanks for the detailed report. Keep it up and stay warm."
521924,spinnerbaitking,2010-11-21 12:31:00,1622,"Great Report, not looking forward to the ice coming down here yet, still trying to get the boat out Richard"
521948,TroutnMuskieHunter,2010-11-21 14:13:00,1362,I got cold just reading your report
521955,DRIFTER_016,2010-11-21 14:34:00,10439, Usually I like 30 to 40 feet but this spot is part way down a steep drop. It is only a few yards from 50 FOW.
521963,xkempx,2010-11-21 15:12:00,84,"-29....wow, I'm taking the boat out on Monday...   High of 9 tomorrow"
521970,TennesseeGuy,2010-11-21 15:28:00,957,"You are the most honest Canadian I've run across.  You actually admitted that you were cold.  I enjoyed your report, but probably won't be heading up that way until the sun starts warming up a bit."
521972,Leecher,2010-11-21 15:37:00,7832,Great report and pics Dave Nice lakers!!! Congrats to the both of you's Thanks for sharing Leechman
