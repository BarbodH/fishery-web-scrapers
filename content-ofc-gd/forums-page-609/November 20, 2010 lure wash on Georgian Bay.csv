521863,irishfield,2010-11-21 01:44:00,26272,"Had to bail on the BOQ trip due to the logistics of Jen's chemo schedule being changed... but I still really needed a fishing fix. Contacted a certain individual that told me ""last minute"" notice was good 'till 10pm Friday night. I skipped the customer stuff Friday and got the boat ready for Muskie hunting instead.. and at 2:30 I contacted said individual to find out that he was now out as he'd forgot it was his wife's birthday!!     .almost got those locks changed...  Sent glen an email and luckily he was online.. 10 minutes to find a babysitter and he was in. We were on the water by 9:10am this morning and crossing the open water between Midland and the back channel was interesting to say the least. 35K gusting 58K directly out of the North. 6 to 8 footers rolling in no certain pattern.. was a fun ride and by drain plug at end of day we probably took on 50 gallons of water. Video never pays conditions justice!!  Trolled a good 45 miles today in all sorts of contours and structure and came up with nothing but a GREAT day on the water. Thanks for sharing the day Glen and giving me a much needed breather from reality for the day. It also got the new engine oils spread around and the the fuel stabilzer thru the systems, so that was great as well.  Hopefully we can get out again before the ramp freezes in !  <object width=""640"" height=""385""><param name=""movie"" value=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NshMrSMBzRo?fs=1&hl=en_US""></param><param'>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NshMrSMBzRo?fs=1&hl=en_US""></param><param name=""allowFullScreen"" value=""true""></param><param name=""allowscriptaccess"" value=""always""></param><embed src=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NshMrSMBzRo?fs=1&hl=en_US"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" allowscriptaccess=""always"" allowfullscreen=""true"" width=""640"" height=""385""></embed></object>"
521864,HTHM,2010-11-21 01:49:00,4082,That is some nasty looking weather you were going through!
521865,tomO,2010-11-21 01:49:00,363,Looks like your boat handles those waves well.
521866,irishfield,2010-11-21 01:52:00,26272,"Glen is glad we put the side curtains in !!  22 foot lund.. with a 56"" bow depth and we still took on a lot of water! Been out in worse though.."
521868,Terry,2010-11-21 01:53:00,14456,good to see you got out fishing  no planks

521870,mercman,2010-11-21 01:55:00,7054,"Ride em cowboy !!!  I was telling Vin the other day, that we all look like weathered cowboys.Take away the boat and give us a horse and we would probably still feel at home !!! that musta got the adrenalin pumpin wayne !!!"
521872,irishfield,2010-11-21 01:58:00,26272,Just another day on the water Paul.. I've been bobbing around out there since 1981. I've put waves completely over a 26' full cabin Searay stuffing the nose straight in and had the wave roll right up over the bow and windshield almost swamping the boat.
521873,tomO,2010-11-21 01:58:00,363,bout the biggest waves i've been in down here were 4 footers in a fast moving storm. That was enouh for me in my boat.
521877,misfish,2010-11-21 02:11:00,29133,"Pounding waves with a cover,,,,,,,,,,, Did ya have a heater too? LOL"
521878,irishfield,2010-11-21 02:12:00,26272,"YEP.. but i never did light it! lol No point in leaving stuff you have at home....  The funny part of the day.. well two of them.  #1 watching 3 guys spend over an hour and a half trying to get unhooked from a submersible cable!  #2 driving by a buck in the field, just before Marty passed us in his truck after leaving here from hunting!"
521897,Guest gbfisher,2010-11-21 03:37:00,0,I bet that certain individual missed out. An hour on a lure? Cheap buggers.    Hand it over to the bay and move on.   ps....marty....go sit where wayne tells ya too and forget about the carrots.
521902,irishfield,2010-11-21 03:50:00,26272,..LOL.. wait 'till I tell him he needs to shovel them all up when he's done!!!
521907,Leecher,2010-11-21 05:13:00,7832,Sounds like you guys had a good time riding them big nasty waves    Always great to share time in the boat with friends Thanks for sharing Wayne!!! Leechman
521933,TroutnMuskieHunter,2010-11-21 13:19:00,1362,How come your windshield wipers aren't working Wayne???
521968,irishfield,2010-11-21 15:25:00,26272,I forgot that option Steve!!  ..and a little cold and nasty for this kind to be out.  
521973,TroutnMuskieHunter,2010-11-21 15:40:00,1362, 
522177,fishhunter,2010-11-22 03:27:00,604,well glad to see you got on the water Wayne. Would have much rather had you in my boat helping land big gold things. I knew what you had on your plate so all good and we will do it next year god willing. I wish your daughter all the best and we will talk soon.
522230,bigbuck,2010-11-22 14:58:00,2449,"Looks like you gave the bilge pump a workout that day along with your sphincter muscles. Quite a bit of pucker factor there. Still, looks like fun battling the waves. I've been out in 4-6 footers in that water and it can be very interesting to say the least."
522250,misfish,2010-11-22 16:49:00,29133," As long as you have a consol in front of ya,it,s ok,,,,,to stuff the odd wave,right Terry"
