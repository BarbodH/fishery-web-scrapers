521135,TC1OZ,2010-11-18 06:44:00,987," Dario has never heard of OFC, he entered at the subway. We know so much about Dave's Facts of Fishing site/contests because he partnered with this forum to get lots of traffic from a very promising market!  I bet all the OFC guys would try to low ball him anyways, since we know he got it for free!"
521500,perchslayer666,2010-11-19 16:54:00,280,"Man, I would have sold that boat too if I had won it. You could get a really nice multi-specie boat, well equipped, plus some new gear, savings, perhaps a down payment on a new towing vehicle.... Lots of new toys.  Besides a boat as flashy as that would be a definite target for thiefs and general morons at the launch every time."
521531,I'mHooked,2010-11-19 18:44:00,525,What's Dave been using for a ride since?
521532,misfish,2010-11-19 18:53:00,29133,"I could leave Kbay with that boat, and be fishing in 15 minutes on Couch."
521533,MCTFisher9120,2010-11-19 18:54:00,3761,If i put my boat(lets pretend the same boat) up for a contest I would hope that the winner would keep and use the boat even if they could only manage 2 or 3 trips a summer with it....rather than somebody the the biggest wallet.
521539,Drew_10,2010-11-19 19:14:00,111,"Too bad it's not worth 45k, not even close."
521545,misfish,2010-11-19 19:49:00,29133," Whats it worth Drew? 36,000 ?"
521685,kyle7273,2010-11-20 02:17:00,65," Dave claimed it was worth $75,000 when the contest was going on."
521753,Dave Mercer,2010-11-20 15:04:00,148,"Hey All, I hope everyone has been catching a few fish. As far as selling the boat it does not shock me at all or bother me one bit. The winner has 3 very young boys and it's not really the right boat for him.  As far as the price Drew 10 you may want to check bass boat central out, all of the same model boats are selling for 45-54 in U.S funds. The boat had a full MSRP of $75,000 when brand new but as we all know boats are an even worse investment than a car but a lot more fun lol. So I think his price is fair.  Take care all and go fishing!!!  Dave"
521758,I'mHooked,2010-11-20 15:17:00,525,"So most importantly Dave, What are you screemin' around in now?"
522077,fish-miester,2010-11-21 22:40:00,864,     maybe he wasn't trying to win the boat.. maybe he just wanted a fishing rod or a camera  (just kidding)
522083,Drew_10,2010-11-21 22:51:00,111,"I stand corrected, the boat seems to be fairly priced.  I didn't realize that the engine was one of the new SHO models.  Still tough to compete with the boat prices in the states."
522252,xkempx,2010-11-22 16:59:00,84,"3 young kids in the house...45,000.00 would be a big help...I have 4 kids in this house. and trying to sell my winner bass boat at $1,900 is a little extra money too...Maybe he will trade me boats....Maybeeeee....lol"
520687,xkempx,2010-11-16 23:31:00,84,"Got looking on kijiji and came across this Skeeter boat for sale...So i looked and its Dave Mercerâ€™s.....  $ 45,000.00  Its A Nice Skeeter  Kijiji....click here"
520695,EC1,2010-11-16 23:38:00,930,"It's pretty much expected. Not very many people out there can upkeep such a big boat, especially feed it the gas it needs on the 250.  Either way, here's the chance for someone to get a boat at a great deal! Just gotta win the 20 million 6/49 tomorrow!"
520699,Terry,2010-11-16 23:43:00,14456,"I don't think that is the problem at all he has to sell this one to get the new one most likely bigger and longer  or it might be that it's just too stained with subway sauce, so it's time for a new one  or that one special bait bucket might have splashed on the deck"
520700,irishfield,2010-11-16 23:44:00,26272,That is kijiji... is it really for sale?
520701,misfish,2010-11-16 23:46:00,29133,"So the person that won it is selling it?  There has to be a new rule in the contest. Those that really, really want to win Daves boat and cherish it, need only apply.  As for the gas,it,s peanuts on that motor."
520702,SRT8 smoker craft,2010-11-16 23:47:00,1107,pretty sure thats the guy that won it not Dave selling it if I remember correctly it was a dude named Dario that won.
520703,skeeter,2010-11-16 23:48:00,1907,"Hey Dave, buy it back and give it to someone who will REALLY appreciate it.  i can think of someone"
520707,misfish,2010-11-16 23:53:00,29133,"  Yeah,like a guy who spent probly over 600 bucks in subs to enter  ,,,,"
520708,scugpg,2010-11-16 23:54:00,1373, Correct sir http://www.factsoffishing.com/blog/contests/hook-line-subway-winners/
520709,skunked,2010-11-16 23:54:00,41,"no, i think that a while some guy won it..and he's selling it.. i wonder why, other then the 45K If I were Dave, Id think unfaithful fan...unless its an emergency for the money or hes downgrading to something more affordable or something like that.."
520710,irishfield,2010-11-16 23:55:00,26272,"I would have sold it as well Brian, if I'd won it. Son  stuffed that ballot box almost daily. Not the kind of boat I would ever own.. but I'd sure take it for free!"
520712,EC1,2010-11-16 23:56:00,930,"Man, there's plenty of us that would love to have won that boat...I hope someone on OFC gets it this time, so there probably won't be any more buying and selling of the boat."
520717,misfish,2010-11-17 00:02:00,29133," Ah like they say,it just takes one ticket to win.   Wholesale to me right? LOL"
520743,xkempx,2010-11-17 00:45:00,84,Under 50hrs on the thing too....Wow he must not fish...Wife filled out the ticket for him...LMAO
520749,dave524,2010-11-17 00:52:00,4508,"I'd sell it too, maybe that boat is not suited for his type of fishing, I'd quickly turn it over for a 22 /24 foot walkaround cuddy cabin with riggers and offshore gear, just sayin"
520772,xkempx,2010-11-17 01:26:00,84,O.k true
521065,TrippyJai,2010-11-18 00:11:00,28,I'll probably sell it as well and use the money to purchase a smaller boat that is more suited for me. That boat is more than I would need. Use that extra money to use some sweet sweet gear!
521074,misfish,2010-11-18 01:05:00,29133,"  It,s still wrong. This is my opinion. You are trying to win a bass boat that Mercer owned/was sponsered.It,s right there in front of your face. WIN DAVES BOAT.  Ok Im just jealous.    But really?????????"
521077,xkempx,2010-11-18 01:19:00,84," I don't know what i thiink...Selling a prize that you tried to win ""boat"" ....Its not like winning the hart and stroke lotto and you DON'T know what your prize is going to be....."
521083,smally21,2010-11-18 01:30:00,993,you win the prize you can do what you want with it.
521087,NAW,2010-11-18 01:35:00,4022,"I'm sure thousands of people who have never fished a day in their life entered that contest, just cuz they might win somthin worth a few $$.  IMO..  If I won a subway plastered bass boat, I'd be selling it too..  But it would be on the OFC classifieds, not Kijiji  Man..  45 grand.  That's a nice general purpose boat, some hunting gear, spending money for the wife, and a little savings to boot!   Edit:.. Multi purpose boat = deep hulled fishing boat that my wife can sun tan it while I fish!"
521088,ccmtcanada,2010-11-18 01:35:00,7971, I got this Terry! Ewwwww!!! LOL   
521096,DRIFTER_016,2010-11-18 02:12:00,10439,  Or a fine down payment on one of these.
521109,TC1OZ,2010-11-18 03:23:00,987,"$45k is a lot of money for some people (probably not someone who can afford richmondhill) and like someone said... he won it, he can do w/e he wants with it!  Grats Dario!   And he won this a while ago... he probably used it before it got too cold out!"
521126,pikehunter,2010-11-18 04:52:00,1659," Me too. Got all the boat I need right now, however I would have posted it for sale in OFC classified first as I would want someone on the board to have 1st. crack at it."
