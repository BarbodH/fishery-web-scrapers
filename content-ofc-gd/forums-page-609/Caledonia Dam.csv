521168,Court R,2010-11-18 13:54:00,213,How's the steelhead fishing been?
521184,cuzza,2010-11-18 15:19:00,467, I didn't catch anything last time I fished there and didn't see anyone else get anything either
521224,tb4me,2010-11-18 17:21:00,3295,lol I drove by there aout 10 days ago...You could have walked across the river on the shoulders of the fishermen..Way too crouded for my likeing..
521485,Fish4Eyes,2010-11-19 15:50:00,1022,Drove by yesterday and saw nobody fishing.
521491,Court R,2010-11-19 16:25:00,213,Thanks guys
521536,solopaddler,2010-11-19 19:06:00,8605,There's fish ladders on either side of that dam. It's illegal to fish within 75' of it. It's right in the reg's yet everyone does it.  People have been charged there before although obviously it seems to be accepted practice and a blind eye is turned.
521542,Roy,2010-11-19 19:30:00,13728,"Mike, you can repeat that message till the cows come home. Some people will never ever read the regulations. A few others will read them and never abide by them and yet others will try to read them but will always claim ignorance."
521548,cuzza,2010-11-19 20:02:00,467, Yup - there area signs all over the place and in fairness when I was there everyone was fishing well away from the dam (me included!)
521551,Court R,2010-11-19 20:09:00,213,"Just asked for a report, didn't say I would be fishing right at the dam."
521588,Roy,2010-11-19 21:56:00,13728, I don't recall mentioning any names. But if you feel it applies to you then.....
521604,cuzza,2010-11-19 22:11:00,467,...and with 451 Views and 9 Replies there are probably quite a few folks keeping an eye on this who it would apply to
521619,laszlo,2010-11-19 22:47:00,487,Some weird smells coming from that dam. With so many places to fish...why go there?
521628,solopaddler,2010-11-19 23:16:00,8605,Sorry Court I guess I assumed you were asking about fishing right at the dam.  Most guys down there do.  My apologies.  Laszlo is right too. If it's steelhead you're after there's way better fishing in other areas especially a bit further downstream.
521629,HTHM,2010-11-19 23:18:00,4082,I was in Goderich today and saw two guys returning from the river with two very nice steelheads in hand. Pity I was working.
521712,Rich,2010-11-20 11:34:00,3927,"The dam is accessible, I'm sure that's why he planned on fishing that area. Not everyone likes walking 400 miles in a cold river for some stupid trout."
521740,skunked,2010-11-20 13:50:00,41,"Maybe 4 miles,  you do it for the conservation part of it, or the 'hunt' for those steelies, I for one love it, fall winter and spring, and I never break a law, its really quite easy not to. if the trout is stupid , why fish for it and break the law to do it.... well those breaking the law fishing at the dam are stupid too."
521771,Smed,2010-11-20 16:37:00,20,Fishing at the dam has been quite poor this year (at least from what I have seen) I havent even seen a bow the last 3 times.  I was hitting fish a month or 2 ago and not even one since.  Smed
521783,Court R,2010-11-20 18:08:00,213,"No problem,just was thinking of trying something differant, been fishing the US tribes the last few weeks."
521784,BiggFish,2010-11-20 18:18:00,40,"Hey Court R,  I have not had any luck at the dam area but have had really good luck and consistency up stream towards Brantford.  Been out 4 or 5 times in that area and likely averaging two fish an outting.  Rapalas, husky jerks and spoons.  Chad"
521913,tributaryhunter,2010-11-21 07:09:00,108," hey chad i lost my cell phone 2 weeks after talking to you, send me a pm i'll give you my home num bud"
521934,Rich,2010-11-21 13:21:00,3927," You don't have to fish within 75M of the dam to be in an accessible shore fishing area in Caledonia. Therefore, nobody needs to break any laws, or waste time 'hunting' steelhead.  I don't fish steelhead really at all anymore. I have a real problem with tromping through fish nests to disturb a natural migration of fish. I for one, think it's ridiculous guys can walk across trout eggs all season but heaven forbid a guy catch and release a bass in April.  BTW fishing at Caledonia is very slow this year. Early runs put fish way upstream. Good reports even further than Brantford from some people this year."
