521070,Moosebunk,2010-11-18 00:51:00,3970,"If people concentrated on the really important things of life, there'd be a shortage of fishing poles.  How true is that..?   The fall fishing photos saved in the home archives are beginning to stretch the vault walls so, I figured it was in best interest to spend a little time investing in a less wordy but full picture report.  This season has been really cool... not the weather so much, that has been kinda hot, not the wind either as it's been constantly a blow, but the fishing for me has been cool.  A real test at times but good fun learning new things.  September ti'll now has been a consistent mix of attempts for local bass, big river muskie and Quinte walleye.  The report on the three would give a mixed grading of a D- for muskies, B for bass and an A+ on BOQ eyes.  The greater motivators have been a determination to learn new tricks on new waters, and at the same time share experiences with friends.  What can be a detriment is being indecisive with the number of options, not having enough midweek partners to turn too, and still not having a solid work schedule to plan things out how I would like.   There won't be any muskies in the report.  Five trips out to three different bodies of water; including a totally new area to me, saw not a fish come over the gunnel.  I finished the year for them in early October, decidedly wanting to make the switch at that time to BOQ walleye.  Next years plans will likely see me trying harder to improve on the fishing during the summer months which there was more success this year.  The bass have been on and off, most days on though.  Where largies have failed there have been a couple days when smallies and eyes have saved the day.  Other times out, the largies have been on fire.  A best afternoon in early November had 60+ largies hooked and a dozen or so pike, while an early October outing proved outstanding for bigger smallies.  Seven times out for bass this fall, only twice were the fish unco-operative.  Lastly BOQ.  First outing in early October with my father was a bust.  The bigger fish hadn't really come home yet but I was just chomping at the bit to test the new gear and myself.  During the next four weeks I ended up sharing two days in TonyB's boat with him and Aaron, and then later during two more separate outings I shared time out once with Grant and once with an old friend visiting from Yellowknife.  At BOQ excluding day one, the four days on the water have totalled a pretty solid 56/64 with 29 fish being walleye.  And of course the word is out about Aaron's remarkable record-breaking sheepie which I thoroughly enjoyed experiencing with him and Tony.  My first year really taking a crack at this has been pretty fun and rewarding.  The coming weeks should hopefully allow for some more walleye, steelhead and maybe a few more bass and/or inland trout.  As I sit here typing this though, a hizelluva north-wind blows to remind me that the fall is near end.  On the shelf at home here the ice gear sits ready, the ATV and Bravo have been prepped, and thoughts of winter trips begin to get planned.  Onto some pics...   THE BASS.                        THE WALLEYE.                                  FRIENDS WITH FISH.   Tony.         Aaron. (with his enormous sheephead)         Grant aka Slop.         Dan. (with new PB walleyes and a first sheephead)         A FEW SCENIC SHOTS.          So there.  That empties the vault for the fall.  Not a usual story type report cause I suffer from S.A.D. and am exhausted of late from playing too hard.  Those heading out to try their luck for the big eyes, good luck to yas.  Fish safe and stay warm, careful on the new ice to come.  Bunk."
