521240,bushart,2010-11-18 18:24:00,2628,OK all the Pervs that thought this was something else------to the back of the bus  With deer season well on it's way I thought I'd show you a new painting I'm working on---Just got the antlers done today and the deer underpainted---it'll be a while yet  I'll post when it's done.  
521241,Guest gbfisher,2010-11-18 18:27:00,0,Don't let Marty shoot it.....BANG!!!...

521251,Smarty Pantz,2010-11-18 19:15:00,203,Very beautiful
521555,bushart,2010-11-19 20:27:00,2628,Figured I'd give one more update as it now looks more like it should.  Again will post when done  
521620,misfish,2010-11-19 22:53:00,29133,Now your adding some nice color Bush.  What size is the canvas your painting on ?
521636,bushart,2010-11-19 23:29:00,2628,48 x 16 Bri.  This foto does'nt do justice to this painting---when I walk by it--that deer stares at me.  I always said I would never paint deer as so many artists' do  But if I ever did---it better be perfect---lets say I've been close to many so there's no room for error.  Let's put it this way---It's turnin out good enough I'm considering limited edition prints.  Like I said--I'll let you guys know what it turns out to be.
521639,misfish,2010-11-19 23:36:00,29133,"Looking forward to the finish.  Nice work,"
