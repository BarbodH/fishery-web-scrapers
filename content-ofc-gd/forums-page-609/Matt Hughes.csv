522016,darsky,2010-11-21 18:49:00,586,Wow !!  Under 22 secs. I was just settling into my chair then POOF its over. Matt-I think its time to retire from MMA
522031,misfish,2010-11-21 19:59:00,29133,"  That was quick and not forseen thats for sure. Lucky punch on the button.  The big question is,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,How did Jackson win that????????????"
522040,Bernie66,2010-11-21 21:12:00,123,
522041,Bernie66,2010-11-21 21:15:00,123,It's called age. Same thing happened to Liddell. It catches up to you no matter how good you were.
522043,misfish,2010-11-21 21:30:00,29133,"Theres always one good fight left in ya. Age has nothing to do with it. Look at the older tapes of UFC. He got caught,thats it."
522059,SBCregal,2010-11-21 22:02:00,688,"he almost sounded like he was contemplating retirement by the way his post-fight interview went.   cant wait for the jackson/machida rematch... jackson said it himself, he got whupped"
522069,misfish,2010-11-21 22:27:00,29133," There ya go. Fighter admits,and the judges see it the way thier told."
522080,SBCregal,2010-11-21 22:45:00,688,at least now machida has come out on both sides of a really poor decision.
522081,bucktail,2010-11-21 22:48:00,1857,"I read an interview with him before the fight that he said he would rather stay at home with his family and hunt and fish ( cant blame him ) but it  sure ddint sound like his heart was in it. Brian is right you cant judge anything on 22 seconds, but it does sound like he is done."
522099,misfish,2010-11-21 23:17:00,29133," Hunt or fish,or get yer face bashed in??????????????? Iwould  fish and hunt too.LOL"
522181,miller,2010-11-22 03:48:00,223,"bj does better at 170 he has more power, in all that time against frankie edgar he couldn't get the finish but in 21 seconds he makes matt hughes look like a nobody, pretty impressive. as for the rampage machida fight i definatly thought machida had that in the bag but it seems the way the judges scored rampage's aggressiveness is what did it for him. if machida shows more aggression earlier on rather than being elusive for two rounds before turning it on he would be a more popular fighter and most likely wouldn't have lost that decision."
522194,steverowbotham,2010-11-22 11:03:00,1800,"BJ Penn came out very motivated and caught Hughes early.  Who knows how it would have gone if the fight lasted longer,  I wouldnt say its time for him to retire, he was riding a 3 fight win streak leading up to this one and looked phenominal against Almeida.  The thing with the Rampage/Machida fight is that the 10 point must system is not effective in MMA IMO.  I had Rampage winning the first 2 rounds then Machida destroyed him in Rd 3.  In UFC's 10 point must system, I had Rampage winning.  If it was PRIDE rules, where you score the whole fight, I would have given it to Machida"
522210,dobee,2010-11-22 13:14:00,301,"hughes was on a nice winning streak and hes gets KO'd and everyone says he too old? LOL!!!!  he got caught! it happens, he will be back and he will win a few more for sure.. dunno if he will make a run at the title again but he still has the skills to win in the octogon."
522399,readfisher,2010-11-23 01:56:00,7,"What happened to Matt Hughes:  He likely had some spoiled eggs for breakfast that day that spoiled the rest of his day and cost him the fight.  He was quoted later on as saying ""now I can't afford to replace the spoiler on my race car, you know the one on the back that everyone sees weather they like it or not'."
