522145,Cudz,2010-11-22 01:29:00,2652,I have fished there a few times.  Not right in Edmonton but about 1-2 hours north.  You can fish waubman or pigeon lake which are closer to Edmonton and offer decent fishing.  Most lakes in and around the city are a bit shallow.  The North saskatchewan holds decent fish but it is very seasonal and access can be difficult.  I really can't help you but there is a good fishing shop called the fishin hole and I believe it is in the west end.  I am sure they can help you out.

Loads of pike and walleye- I was amazing by the average size of the walleye while down there. Just wrote a blog about my trip  http://www.wfn.tv/blog/Jamie/ , In january you will have to drill.. getting cold there! have fun. Looking forward to your report  Jamie"
522448,Cudz,2010-11-23 03:34:00,2652,THere are lots of good walleye in Alberta.  You are rarely allowed to keep any.  I guess that is why they have a great walleye fishery all over the provice.
