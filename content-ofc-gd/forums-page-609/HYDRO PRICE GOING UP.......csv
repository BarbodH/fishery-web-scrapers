522341,Billy Bob,2010-11-22 23:36:00,5865, See now you really discredited yourself with made up facts and Bull....  Read this young man.....http://www.buffalonews.com/wire-feeds/24-hour-national-news/article249519.ece
522346,mercman,2010-11-22 23:53:00,7054,"  BB, we talked about this before.On our dollar coin we have a LOON, not a LONN.Hence the name LOONie. We dont want people callin ya a redneck, right Ok....now carry on. The Canadiasn economy is so attached to the US ecomony, that we could slide a curly hair between the 2. If the US economy goes teats up, the Canuck economy will without a doubt sink right behind it.So as long as thats true, i want Billy Bob to be mt best friend."
522347,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-11-22 23:54:00,0," OH boy! Supply natural gas for the next 50 years!lol They will probably start slant drilling to steal Canada's gas like they got Kuwait to do to Saddam after Saddam took them out of the loop!  ARTICLE:A drilling boom has been under way since 2008 in the Marcellus Shale, a vast underground geologic formation that extends from West Virginia and eastern Ohio through Pennsylvania into southern New York. Some geologists estimate it could yield enough natural gas to supply the entire East Coast for 50 years.  I also hear the area is radioactive and it will be very difficult to extract the gas. Let me know how that works out for you.LOL  The only thing you got going for you is Alaska.  Hey wait a minute. I was joking about the slant drilling but look at this!  Combining a new process of horizontal drilling with a technique known as hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, drillers are unlocking vast deposits there and in other formations around the U.S. such as the Barnett Shale in Texas - a boom that could ensure cheap and plentiful natural gas for many years to come for homeowners, factories and power plants.  Horizontal drilling hey?? Sounds sneaky!!!But hey. America is an empire built on stealing resources from other nations for next to nothing.  Never mind fracking. The rock is full of uranium and pyrite. And the locals have enviornmental concerns.  ARTICLE:""If anything, there are more votes against it,"" he said Tuesday.  ARTICLE:Rolf Hanson of the Associated Petroleum Industries of Pennsylvania, an industry lobbying group, said: ""I for sure don't see this as, 'All of a sudden things are going to be rosy for the industry and we're going to get a free pass.'""    Oh and tell me again how the Fall of the American economy would bring Canada down also? And brag about the strength of the American dollar.lol"
522352,mercman,2010-11-23 00:00:00,7054,"  Thats a pretty scarey place to be sitting man.How long do you think it would take the Yanks to absorb us as just another state.Push to shove, the survival instinct is the strongest of our primal instincts, and history shows that what they want, they get.its better we share now rather than give it up later.The way i see it anyways."
522353,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-11-23 00:03:00,0," I dont think that is true. Sure alot of our exports to America would cease, but so would our imports from China.Which means we could start producing things on our own. We have the technology and the resources.  America on the other hand, without Canadian aid would take forever to pick itself back up. Once their economy does a nose dive, we could use them for cheap labour.lol"
522355,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-11-23 00:07:00,0,Hey. I noticed you didn't have anything to say about the worlds greatest nation.  The US dollar is at par with the Loonie. Secondly? The international community is losing confidence in the dollar as the international reserve currency. If that were to happen? Your dollar would do a nose dive. The only thing propping up the dollar right now is that Asia is buying American debt and reserve currency.  No comment?

522374,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-11-23 00:54:00,0,"  Well they are already annexing us as we speak. But rather than total annexation, they are keeping us separate to exploit our weaker dollar(cheap labour).  Actually, America lost both wars with Canada. Thanks to help from the British.  All we need is a few nukes as deterence.  Hey, I dont mind sharing with our neighbours. What I do mind is being taken advantage of."
522385,mercman,2010-11-23 01:23:00,7054,"  I don`t know about cheap labor.Canada has one of the highest paid workforces in the world.As far as the British go, the came to our rescue because we were a colony back then.I doubt very much if they would be willing to stick thier necks out for us now. As far as Nukes, did you live through the cold war and the Cuba crisis. I did, and i am scarred to this day by the fear and uncertanty that i lived through. Being shown how to put a gas mask on and how to curlup into a ball to try and hide from the blast and EMP, at 7 years old.No 7 yr old should have to live that. We need to spend money in hybrid technology. bio fuel, wind and sun energy.Hydro based electricity,passive solar energy and other non polluting renewable and sustainable energy sources. THEN WE KICK  AND GET OURSELVES INTO A POSITION OF POWER OVER OUR OWN LIVES.  but the money hungry goats posteriors running our GOV will never let this happen"

522434,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-11-23 02:59:00,0," Really? Don't you remember when Mulrooney made the free trade agreement? And he was shipping in all kinds of cheap labor that was willing to work for cheap(China, India, Pakistan)? Manufacturing jobs took a big hit. They started hiring immigrants at $7 an hour. Which before that the average was $10-$12. Now its back to $10 but alot of them are hiring through these American job agencies, which dont have to give you raises or pay you benefits(this used to be automatic). Absolute Bull!!!!They save money on that alone.  If America dared attack Canada? Do you think the international community would just sit back and watch? The nukes are insurance. Its not like anyone would engage in a nuclear war. No one would win.  I totally agree with switching to alternate energy but the stinkin rich are making too much money off oil and electricity and wont convert unless they find a way to market the altertnative energy for the same amount of profit they make now or more."

Its funny you should mention that. When my family went to Mexico for a few weeks? I was left to look after the house. I deciced to turn the heat right down(in the winter), since I was never home.

522458,knightfisher,2010-11-23 04:59:00,237,"  Went on a tour of the Sir Adam Beck hydro plant here in Niagara a few years back. The guide told us that 80% of the hydro produced goes directly to the states. Then sold back to us at a higher rate if we need it. In regards to our other natural resources, most of them have been sold off to other countries/corporations. The basic necessities of life which most are on their way to private hands will be the down fall of our standard of living. What has happened to Greece, Ireland, and Portugal is next, is what we can expect here. But before that happens here, most of the middle class, that's most of us, will be wiped out. Google has a ton of information, if one can stomach it.  Agenda 21 and or 1984, just around the corner.  We the people have the power to turn this around, but that would mean giving up our current life style, and actually taking responsibilty and getting others doing the same, contacting our MPs forming peaceful protests, running ads in the paper etc. Requires lots, and lots of work.  You willing to give up your current lifestyle and putting your nose to the grindstone and getting others to do the same.......  Hey I would love to talk and recommend more on this subject, but I have to watch the end of the game, and get the latest scores.....  A lot of cheap talk, as we bend over, with out even asking our handlers for some K-Y jelly."

I was listening to a radio show last week and they were talking about the price difference of premium gas here in Canada and the good US of A the gentlemen said it`s simple Canadians will pay anything so we charge accordingly.

I would like someone to explain to me why I, the simple residential user is being forced to subsidize industry's electricity hunger? If time of use is correct and the peak demand periods are during the day, when most of us are not home, why am I , the lowly resident getting hit between the eyes paying for industry's energy requirements. The ""debt recovery tax, as far as I recall, was instituted to help pay off the shutting down and maintenance of our nukes, you can thank Bob Rae for that. Salaries at OPG are amoung the best in the province, the ""leadership"" are also well paid!

I tried saving money on electricity by using my fireplace and wood stove. Insurance company ruined that one. Never ending. The common man can't win and it's not getting any better. They should cut the salaries retroactively of the clowns that allowed us to be under charged for electricity. I am sure they are all still employed and cant wait to retire on their fat salaries. They are probably getting a cut rate on electricity anyway.

522322,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-11-22 22:47:00,0," That sounds more like it. The fact that people believe that they actually subsidized electricity for all these years is hilarious.  The only good thing about privatization is, we'd get to get rid of these over payed government workers, that keep crying for more money!! Then we would give it in one lump sum to the CEOs like in America.  The fact that they are saying the Hydro Canada was losing money, is a bunch of crock, so they can sell us off to the highest bidder and put money in their pocket. My suspicion is that even though they said they didn't privatize it? They did. WHich would explain the ""private companies"" involved.  I heard Niagara alone was supplying enough energy for Ontario and half of the northern parts of the North East USA. Thats probably why we pay more for our own electricity. To subsidize American Hydro. Its funny how a problem in the OHIO grid blacked out Ontario too......  These figures of Nuclear plants costing in the billions is a joke. Canada's first plant cost like 90 million, 40 years ago. I doubt its anywhere near $1 billion. But like everything the government pays for, it usually over pays people for services(as a thank you for campaign donors and supporters.) Plus they put tax payers money back into their pockets.  We need more nuclear plants, since they closed down two and we only have 3 running.We should open up some more biomass plants to take car of the garbage problem also."

522327,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-11-22 23:00:00,0," I doubt that very much. We are a resource based economy. We wouldn't get hit as hard. Canada has everything it needs to sustain itself. The USA depends on Canada for Oil, Hydro, Natural gas, ect...  The reason why our economy is tied to the USA is thanks to free trade. Mulrooney sold us out. Which is not surprising, since him and Bush belong to the same millionaires club.  Now foreigners are buying up everything in Canada.Foreign corporations now run the show.  I want McGuinty out(not that a conservative would fair any better), but I want a Liberal(preferably French) prime minister. Or we will be talking Chinese and east Indian soon."

Why is all of Northern USA homes being heated by Canadian resources? Obama is saying they will lead in alternate energy sources but so far, nothing on the horizen.

521608,scuro2,2010-11-19 22:20:00,904,"Ontario did price out two plants at $26 billion dollars and thought better of it. Cost overruns are common with Nuclear Power, as are shut down plants, or plants working at a reduced capacity. Then there is the issue of the cost of decommissioning plants and getting rid of the nuclear waste. Canada's nuclear power plants produces hundreds of thousand tons of tailings each year along with 85000 radioactive spent fuel bundles.  Where do you think Ontario Hydro's 20 billion dollar debt and the 0.7 ¢/kWh debt reduction charge on your monthly bill came from? Do you actually believe that new Nuclear Power plants are the cheaper long term option...or even the cleaner option?"
521614,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-11-19 22:35:00,0," Oh I get it! Rather than increase our electrical capacity? Lets just keep supply's low so we can overcharge! That way they dont have to spend any money and they can increase their profits!!!  And why has natural gas gone up and has become at par with electricity? You going to tell me its because of gas shortage too?  We can be producing all kinds of electricity out of natural gas for cheap, not to mention all kinds of other alternate energy we have already going on. But that would get in the way of profits. Why spend money when you can make money right?  I believe Power plants are a great investment. Our population will just keep growing and growing, and if this trend continues, they will just keep increasing the costs. With the Bull excuse, they cant keep up with demand!  This is just plane robbery. This is not supply and demand! This is control supply so we can manipulate the prices."
521622,aplumma,2010-11-19 22:56:00,6896,The one thing I have noticed when I am visiting Canada is the availability of power to some really remote places. I have seen some of the islands on Nipissing that had a fishing shack made of plywood and tarpaper with power run to it. Down here in the states they estimate the amount of power you will use in 2 years and anything above the estimate the builder has to pay up front. I have a house that is 200 yards from a main road and if they could run it overhead to within 250 ft of the house and then go under ground for 1000.oo but if I wanted it underground all the way with a transformer and concrete pad it would cost me 6500.oo   Art
521623,irishfield,2010-11-19 23:02:00,26272,"We pay for those runs too Art. I was into $17,850 by the time I had one power plug in the hangar. $4350 to add one span down the concession road.. and then 1400 feet of 30KVA underground, the cement vault and $1700 for the transformer.  You can pay extra to get some kick back if anyone ever wants to go further with the line (within 5 years). So those Islands.. the first guy pays to get it to his.. and when the next guy comes along Hydro gives the first guy some money back and charges the next guy full price.. etc as it works it's way island to island.  Overhead.. you pay for your line/poles from the property line.. Hydro will pay for a pole transformer (but not one on the ground vault) and they even credit you for the wire to get across the road if the power line isn't on your side of the concession."

CTV News: Bruce Power got millions to not produce electricity ‘The people of Ontario paid Bruce Power nearly $60 million in 2009 to not generate electricity for the province, CTV Toronto has learned. A deal between the nuclear generator, a private company, and the Ontario Power Authority (OPA) sets out a guarantee for a certain amount of power to be purchased -- even if it's not needed. The technical term is called surplus baseload generation. The agency agreed to pay Bruce $48.33 for each megawatt hour of electricity that was not needed. In 2009, demand for electricity was down in Ontario, largely as a result of the recession. This meant Bruce's nuclear reactors weren't operating at full capacity.

As for conservation I do my part. I do not drive one day a week!  I don't see why we PAY FOR NOT producing . . . and yet we have these pricing structures.  Doest it cost more to generate in the daytime than at night? Hell, I worked the night shift many, many, many years ago; we got paid more! I'm sure the guys working nights at Niagara/elsewhere are not paid by the KW/h or they would want the mid-peak or on-peak shift.  Maybe he should change his name to McScrewyou.

Took me quite a long time (over a year) to figure it out and convince someone there that they made a big mistake.  I was first told to call an electrician because surely there was nothing wrong with the meters.  There was nothing wrong with the meter itself, it was labelled wrong....I had been paying my neighbours for over 2 years.  (I own one of 11 condos in a three story building)  When all was said and done - they owed me over $700.00"
521467,lookinforwalleye,2010-11-19 14:14:00,4399, We had a guy come to our warehouse in Brampton the other day wanting to do the same thing must be big bucks in it.
521480,Fish4Eyes,2010-11-19 15:07:00,1022,"To put the solar panel profits into perspective, a buddy of mine works for oakville hydro and said that a 3000 ish sq ft house will get you about 800-900$ a month. The solar panel installation for a house that size is probably 70k. It would pay for itself in about 10 years and then it would be all profit. If the system were to breakdown in that time, im pretty sure they come with 20-25 year warranty.  I am on a smart meter and my current billing is not that bad as I watch my usage. You would be suprised the difference it makes to wash/dry your laundry and use your dishwater during off peak periods. My off peak usage was 650ish kw/h, which is more than I would use during peak and mid peak times. I have a 2000ish sq ft house with a high efficiency furnace and my last bill for 2 months was $212. I keep the house at 22 degrees when we are home and 20 degrees when not home and when sleeping (they say you sleep better when its cooler btw). I also have a 20+ year old stove and 2 fridges running that are 10+ years old. My previous bill for 2 months that I got before the 212$ one was 300 and that bill had 6-7 weeks of steady AC use to keep the house at 23 degrees. My next purchase will be a gas stove and I bet that will shave an additional 20-30$ off the bill as you usually cook supper during peak times. Watch your usage people."
521481,12footspringbok,2010-11-19 15:08:00,459,My work just put up 48 panels last week. It will take them roughly 6 years to pay off the cost of the panels then its pure money in the bank....

They are going to keep raising bills till they complain it is unsustainable and if we dont privatize it, prices will continue to increase, While putting money in their pockets, for slling off Canada's assets, one by one. Now that all these companies have been allowed to subcontract and buy electricity from Hydro, and sell it to us, for an added cost, obviously. And you wonder why Hydro is going up. Hydro is much cheaper to make then what they are charging us. Yet it still continues to rise.  Whats there excuse for natural gas? It used to be 10X cheaper then electricity and now it is at par with electricity almost. Thank enbridge(privatization) for that one. The Americans pay cheaper then us. What robbery...  I'm all for this green energy, and if we would pay for it and make our lives easier, then that would be one thing.

Based on past owners usage my equal billing is 200 a month, I don`t know what their habits were but I guess we`ll see in a couple of months if that 200 a month is realistic number for us. We tend not to be wasteful and I have replaced all light bulbs with CFL`s and replaced the thermostats to allow programing and apparently the new thermostats are much more efficent. We try and save with small things knowing they will add up like use the toaster oven instead of turning on the big oven and not leaving the TV and lights on when not in use. The one advantage that I can see with the EBB is that I can shut everthing off in the house and only heat what we want, currently we only have two baseboard on in the house and that is in the living room and master bedroom, and I am thinking of shutting them off and using portable heaters.
