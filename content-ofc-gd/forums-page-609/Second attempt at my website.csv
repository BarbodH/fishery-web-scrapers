520752,Roy,2010-11-17 01:00:00,13728,"Good stuff, Mike. I just connected your banner to your site. You seem to have a few patterns that scoring more than others....you should call those ""Powerbarz""."
520761,aplumma,2010-11-17 01:09:00,6896,Good job Mike I like the website now it's time for the orders to start rolling in.  Art
520764,mercman,2010-11-17 01:13:00,7054,Nice job Mike.Let the orders start rolling in. Good luck.
521800,mercman,2010-11-20 19:47:00,7054,the 3 new patterns look like killer baits !!! think i'l order 1 of each and use them in the spring on my very first muskie hunt
521802,misfish,2010-11-20 19:57:00,29133,"Hey Mike  Where did the name ""Confusion"" come from?"
521819,radar,2010-11-20 20:52:00,138,Looks good!
521850,Handlebarz,2010-11-21 00:00:00,3790,Thanks a lot Roy its working great. I like the Powerbarz I had some thoughts along that line for the different sizes 8's would be Sissybarz (smaller but still kick musky butt) 10's dragbarz (they pull the drag like a mother) but I could not get much more thought full to come up with powerbarz or I might have gone there LOL. I guess 10's would make great powerbarz and 13's could be the true dragbarz great for pulling the drag trolling them.  Thanks for the orders guys Paul I will have the parts after the new year for the 2011 baits.  Brian I can make bass sized inline if ya like what colors are your fancy? Brian the wife was looking at the bait the first time I made it and said that looks confusing to me what is it called??? I replied Confusion now I guess??? so she was named from then on.  Thanks Terry Gerritt Art and Radar

522191,Handlebarz,2010-11-22 10:16:00,3790,Thanks Richard and Jaques. The site was the first one I have done but they do make it easy with the templates it just took some time to find them and then add all my stuff to it.  I hope to have some more parts and pieces by the new year for the double 10's so I will keep you up to date for sure
