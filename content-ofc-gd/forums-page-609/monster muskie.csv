522115,esoxansteel,2010-11-21 23:32:00,1307,"  That was the first thought that came to me as well, the pic is in infisherman have a look havnt heard anything else on this fish where as McNairs fish was all over the news, other fishing boards etc in no time"

522123,irishfield,2010-11-21 23:55:00,26272,Only fitting that GB gets that video back up in this post...  Just so much suspicion and question in the Muskie world... it's just another fish!
