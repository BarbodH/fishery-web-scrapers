522103,Dave Bailey,2010-11-21 23:22:00,1641," No, they are an introduced species."
522144,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-11-22 01:20:00,0," Well B.C. is a bit too far for me. Its like if they had a cormorant problem, its up to the locals, not me to stop it. Here in Ontario, I am local. And cormorants are a local nuisance."
522146,mercman,2010-11-22 01:33:00,7054,seagulls prey on cormorant eggs and young.Ive noticed a drop in seagull population locally.I wonder if this is happening elsewhere and whether there is a tie here.  
522150,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-11-22 01:54:00,0," Chipmunks are eco friendly and so are snakes. They consume rodents. Cormorants are destroying trees and gorging on fish fry.  What the heck is it with all these people wanting to protect cormorants, I dont know!"
522155,mercman,2010-11-22 02:22:00,7054,"http://www.on.ec.gc.ca/wildlife/factsheets/fs_cormorants-e.html  Bob posted this on page 1 of this thread.Did anyone actually read it.It states that cormorant populations in the great lakes has been declining steadily in recent years. Here is an excerpt. ""In recent years, the explosive growth of the cormorant population has definitely slowed. The largest colony on the Great Lakes, at Little Galloo Island in Lake Ontario, showed a 31% decrease in numbers of breeding pairs between 1992 and 1994. In 1994, the cormorant population of Lake Ontario decreased by 6%. This was the first such decline in over 15 years. In 1992, Newcastle Disease Virus killed up to 30% of the young cormorants in several colonies. These population declines and disease outbreaks are signs that other factors are starting to have an impact on the population. Thus it seems unlikely that the cormorant population will continue to grow as it has during the 1980s and early 1990s.  According to fisheries biologists, stocks of the smaller prey fish have been decreasing dramatically in recent years. This decrease in the cormorants' food supply is probably already contributing to their decline on Lake Ontario.""  Its a long read but if you are going to argue for the death of a species, then read a little on it first.  "
522178,Grimace,2010-11-22 03:33:00,2020,Chipmunks are eco friendly is my new favorite line.   An Eco system is based on the fact that the animals would be Eco neutral.  Fluctuations should not be met with knee jerk reactions.  It will all even out in the end.  Or it might not.  99.9 percent of all animals that have inhabited this earth are now extinct.   Evolution is carrying us on it's back. Roll with it.

521324,Dave Bailey,2010-11-18 23:50:00,1641," As far as I know seals are not eating Atlantic cod, their primary food source is Arctic cod, which are not fished commercially. And if seals were the problem, why were the Grand Banks full of cod when Europeans first arrived, and nobody was bashing them over the heads then? One thing that seems apparent is that the present policy of culling seals and hoping that the cod stocks recover hasn't worked. Maybe the seals are eating something that competes with Atlantic cod for food or spawning beds, and giving the seals free rein to eat the competitor(s) might help the stocks recover. I would propose stopping the cull for a 10 year period, if the cod stocks recover, fine. If they don't we scratch our heads. If they plummet then we can blame the seals again and re-instate the hunt. As it is now we don't know. I think it's time to do some science."

Make it like the good old days... if you wanted to eat fish you'd have to go out and catch one.. Least in Canada anyway..  I mean though suckers are considered coarse fish, you often find them in chinese markets labelled as ""Northern Canadian Mullet"" labeled wrong.. and how sustainable is a take and take fishery..  I doubt the MNR goes around stocking commercial fishing grounds with coarse fish fry.."
521417,Dave Bailey,2010-11-19 03:37:00,1641," There's no way I would go with a ban on Great Lakes commercial fishing unless the science says that it's unsustainable. It has been going on for years and a lot of people and communities depend on it. For sport fishers to say that it is bad for us is selfish. Let's concentrate on cleaning up the ecosystem and doing some proper studies, I'm certain that commercial fishing can carry on."

I, for my part, am expressing an opinion. Uneducated and educated opinions can further discussion, and I believe discussion is worthwhile. I am not trying to change peoples minds, rather trying to make people think about something they may have not thought about before.  I agree that a controlled study may be the best way to go about finding out if the cormorants are the problem. Culling may indeed be an option. I just wanted to point out that the attitude of finding scapegoats rather than diagnosing the problem is dangerous and will not solve the problem. Please do not mistake me for a radical environmentalist. If it was proven that killing cormorants would improve fishing I would be all for it, as angling is a passion of mine. I just think we need to consider what we can do ourselves to change our behaviour before we look outside of ourselves.  If you read the article that introduced this topic it talks about how cormorants will eat larger fish than we would commonly believe (and I believe this article is from the uk). A previous post talked about how cormorants are dangerous because they feed on smaller juvenile fish. To me this indicates that people are looking to blame and find an easy answer outside of themselves.  I guess I am really sensitive towards this issue, and am not expressing myself clearly. I do appreciate most of the the opinions that are being expressed."

If they are just expressing opinions or based on anecdotal evidence than they generally will probably will not solve the problem. I think I have expressed my opinion on this topic clearly."
521626,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-11-19 23:11:00,0," Here are a few things for you to consider.First, they were not here in big numbers. Now they are everywhere. Now would you say they are having a negative, positive, or neutral effect to our lakes and environment? Some person noted they are here because the forage can sustain them. FOR NOW! After they wipe out the forage they will start moving to a new place to rape and pillage. Do we wait for them to entirely decimate an area?  You said.""If it was proven that killing cormorants would improve fishing I would be all for it, as angling is a passion of mine."" Never mind angling, which it is clear they are an invasive species, since they did not exist in such large numbers or at all in the past. What about the trees? Have you seen what they do to trees? You dont need a PHD to know they are destroying the environment. Just look at some of the islands they have overun....  Those are the negatives, What are the positives?  The fact of the mater is the government doesn't like dishing out extra cash when they dont have to. That is why they have been dragging their feet. I say we make them nest? Torch the nesting grounds, and then its open season on cormorants(shot guns)!"
521647,Afraz,2010-11-19 23:51:00,250," According to your logic, everytime a species evolves or finds a niche that it can exploit it is considered invasive and thus must be destroyed. I wonder what the cormorants think of us lol.. As far as invasiveness is concerned we colonized every single part of the world because of our dominance. Now if a species is capable of doing something similar we disallow it because it threatens our superiroity ? comeon.. they are birds lol.. doin whats birds do.. feed and poop..  There weren't that many people in Canada in huge numbers, does that mean we should have put a ban on immigration and child birth thinking that our resources would be put under stress ?  As far as i am concerned its just natural selection.. let nature play itself out.. if we want to fashion the evolution of our planet and enviornemnt based on our own image and the like thereof than there is no stopping the inevitable.. but for the time being..leave the cormorants alone and worry more about the guys who haul 12000 Lbs of fish catch 10000 over their limit and get slapped with a  2000 dollar fine, still making tonnes of cash even after paying the fine (my numbers may be off but most of you have an idea what i am talking about)..."

We are the superior species. If a species was able to conquer us, we would have no choice. Though the rule of any species, is cater to our own before any other species.  I'm surprised you and P3TA haven't started the ""lets save the Mosquito and Cockroach"" movement. After all, they are just insects.  If our resources were under stress and we brought in immigrants, we would have to have the dumbest leadership on the planet. And why do you keep comparing people to cormorants as if they were the same thing?LOLIts natural for them to come here and take our food, though its not natural for man to stand by and do nothing about it. They are an invasive species and all invaders should be dealt with.If waiting for them to deplete our fish life and destroy our trees is nature playing itself out? I am not interested.  Its like some pickerel fishermen kill Musky in lakes, so they don't compete with the walleye. If your a sport fishermen, you may have a beef, but if you eat fish, you'd be all for it no? Never mind let nature take its course. It makes sense to kill the competition. That is man's natural instinct, when there is depleted resources. They are depleting our resources, so my natural extinct is to wipe them out. Man over cormorant."

If cormorants had always been around here in the numbers they are now it would be considered normal. The fact is that the current range expansion is a natural event, species expand and contract their ranges all the time as environmental conditions change. And if you read my article carefully you would understand that I do not say that we should do nothing, but what I believe we should not do is a knee-jerk reaction. It should be obvious to anyone that something has changed to allow them to expand, so let's find out what it is. If we find out that they are chomping down on round gobies and the fry of asian carp, would you then still feel like exterminating them? And when P E T A comes calling, as they surely will, we may find ourselves fighting on three fronts - cormorants, P E T A, and public opinion."

521161,Dave Bailey,2010-11-18 13:36:00,1641,"Oooooh boy, this could lose me a few friends. Here is an article I wrote a few years ago, but never got around to submitting to anyone. If you decide to read it please do so from beginning to end before dashing off a critical diatribe, and take the time to digest it.  ===========  Cormorants are ugly! (but leave them alone)  Perched above a scrawny neck, on a head which waggles to and fro like a frenetic robot, are a pair of beady eyes which hardly seem adequate to peer past the inelegant hooked bill. The black feathers adorning the body are not particularly sleek or glossy, rather, they perpetually look as if the owner has just emerged from a sooty chimney. In flight they present a crooked profile, and when in the water they ride low, as if they are constantly on the verge of sinking. They waddle on land like an inebriated goose, and their unholy cackle is unmusical and grating. Their vast colonies are bleak guano covered rock piles denuded of vegetation, with stick nests adorning bare dead tree branches reaching in vain for sunlight from which they can no longer gain energy.  As you can probably guess I am not enamored of the double crested cormorant, not the least reason of which is that it seems to be having a negative effect on one of my favourite birds, the black crowned night heron. The heron is much prettier, but appears to have a preference for the same sort of nesting areas that are now being usurped by exploding cormorant populations. And it is that population growth which is being viewed with alarm by many in Ontario, an understandable reaction but one that may be misplaced in its proposals about how to handle the situation.  A few decades ago cormorants began expanding both in numbers and range at a staggering rate, and can now be seen in almost every body of water in southern and central Ontario, including urban ponds of only a few acres extent. Sportsmen are worried that they may have a debilitating effect on fish populations, and have been clamoring to have controls in place before fish stocks decline.  Is this level of concern warranted? Possibly, but in the rush to judgment let’s not simply think that lowering cormorant numbers will bring us back to the halcyon days when fish abounded in our lakes and rivers. Because they still are.  There are two misconceptions that I have heard directed at the cormorants, both of them so easily dismissed that if any of you are using them I advise you to stop before some kid fresh out of a grade 6 environmental studies class tears you to shreds. The first is the claim that cormorants are an introduced species. Balderdash! Nobody ever went out to a cormorant colony, fired a net over it, bundled some into a truck, and released them in Ontario. They have always been here, albeit in smaller numbers a few decades ago, and at one time that may have been much more numerous than they are today. The second accusation is that they will eat everything. No, they will not. As a predatory species with a rather catholic diet they may eat almost anything, but that is not the same as everything. Any predator exists in balance with its food resources, and once cormorant populations reach a certain level they will be kept naturally in check by the availability of prey, and there are indications that in some areas of the province they may have already reached that point, and may be declining slightly. Simply put, they cannot eat everything.  So what is the reason for the growth in numbers? Whatever it may be it isn’t the bird’s fault, cormorants just doin’ what cormorants gotta do, or for that matter what any animal has to do - eat, breed, and survive. There has obviously been some radical change in circumstance which is allowing them to do it better than before, and that is what we need to address. Have they benefited from the clearer waters brought about by the influence of a true introduced species, the zebra mussel? Cormorants are sight feeders which need to see their quarry, and anyone who grew up during the fifties and sixties will remember that trying to find your nose in front of your face underwater was well nigh impossible in those days when phosphate pollution had algae blooming so thick that you could almost walk from Toronto to Rochester without getting your ankles wet. Okay, an exaggeration maybe, but the water in the lower Great Lakes back then could charitably be described as ‘opaque’. Presuming that a hunting cormorant could even swim through the thick fibrous mats of algae, they would be hard-pressed to see the fish they were after.   What have we got to complain about?  Sport fishers have it better today than at any time in history. Fibreglass or carbon fibre rods are lightweight, exceptionally strong, and sensitive to the slightest nibble. Modern high-tech reels are on a par with anything NASA could produce for a mission to Mars, smooth in action and reliable, and they are spooled with monofilament or braided line that is light-years ahead of whatever primitive twine Izaak Walton used. Fish finders and hand-held gps units enable us to locate the best areas in a lake with hardly a glance at a map, and there are many resources available in print or on the web to help us before the season even starts. Step into a high powered boat that has a shallow draft, a live well, and a quiet 4-stroke engine, and get yourself to your honey-hole. Reach into your tackle box for the latest plastic grub, scented to attract fish better than live bait. Stocking programs by governments and sports clubs have ensured that desirable species are kept at sustainable levels. Halcyon days indeed, but we seem to be worried that cormorants are taking our fish. Well, they are not our fish any more than the cormorant’s fish (not even the stocked ones really, we went and poured them into a lake), and in fact they are a lot more important for a cormorant, which doesn’t have the luxury of a local supermarket. And if, as is often claimed, anglers are mostly practicing ‘catch and release’, then we’re obviously not doing this for the filéts.  Which is worse?  By picking on cormorants we may be playing into the hands of something more insidious and more of a threat – P E T A and its ilk. If we press for cormorant controls based on our own desire to remove them as competitors then they can more easily sway the public with the idea that we are heartless killers caring nothing for the other denizens of the wild, and we would need to expend resources fighting back. Why not save our energies by not giving them a battle that will have to be fought? Cormorants don’t care if we catch a fish or not, and they will never actively try to prevent us from fishing. They don’t care what we eat, and they will never try to force us to avoid food which our bodies have evolved to eat and turn us into vegetarians. Cormorants will never parade with placards at bass tournaments, handing out brochures slandering us and our lifestyle. Cormorants are blindly going about their business as part of the natural order, P E T A et al are willfully promoting an unnatural, unscientific, and indefensible agenda designed to further their rather twisted view of how we should behave.  =============="

521187,Gregoire,2010-11-18 15:41:00,1397,I find it funny that as humans we are constantly looking to place the blame on causes outside of ourselves. Accusing cormarants of lowering fish populations in lakes in Ontario is similar to accusing seals of wiping out the cod population on the Grand Banks. If we ever realize that humans are responsible for 99% of the changes that occur in ouor environment than maybe we will change the way we act as opposed to looking for scapegoats. I do not see how a rational person can blame poor fishing in an area on a bird. Just my two cents
521190,Terry,2010-11-18 16:02:00,14456,well I think everyone knows that humans are a/the major factor  but eliminating people just doesn't sit well with most  we are the dominate animal on earth and are self-aware so what is left is to control the numbers of animals to match today's environment and our needs  it is a balancing game..but we are top of the food chain

This persistent myth speaks volumes to me about the nonsense that has been put into peoples heads about the natural world/environment. The cormorants arrival here in the last century and their great success at exploiting the great lakes ecosystem is a perfect example that we (people) are not the only creatures to upset the balance of nature ( I believe that this whole idea of the balance of nature is simplistic hogwash ) . It was perfectly natural for the cormorants to migrate here and for them to exploit and effect the great lakes environment. It is also perfectly natural that we are concerned about this and take measures to control their population. An egg oiling campaign every spring would do this and provide work for people. I think cormorants have been studied enough.  By the way. Every spring one of the spots I fish for carp is about 50 m. from a cormorant nesting site. It stinks, but I get a kick out of watching them. They are here to stay."

521250,Gregoire,2010-11-18 19:11:00,1397," I do not think anyone but the most radical environmentalist would recommend eliminating people. What I am saying is that instead of blaming animals, or anyone else, we need to take responsability for our actions. If we accept that the way we act inflences fish populations, we will be more likiely to change. If we balme somehting else, and do not accept that we are part of the problem, then we will keep finding scapegoats, because nothing will change and the problem will not go away. Arguing that cormorants are decimating fish populations in the great lakes is like arguing seal populations caused the collapse of the cod fishery in the grand banks."

521261,Lungelarry,2010-11-18 19:46:00,294,"By the way. Every spring one of the spots I fish for carp is about 50 m. from a cormorant nesting site. It stinks, but I get a kick out of watching them. They are here to stay.  The carp or the cormorants?????"
521266,cwpowell,2010-11-18 20:19:00,265," The carp or the cormorants?????     Probably both, ha. I wouldn't eat a carp even if I was a cormorant, especially from Hamilton."
521270,hammercarp,2010-11-18 20:54:00,964,Lungelarry  Both.   Get used to it.  cwpowell  You're right. Good idea.
521271,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-11-18 20:58:00,0," Terry is right. We cant stop the fishermen from fishing(only regulate), but we can stop the comorants.  Would you like it if fishermen started keeping everything they caught and that means 1 inch perch? Well that is what these comorants are doing. They are attacking the food chain at the bottom end. If they keep consuming the small fry, how will they grow up to spawn? Maybe we should put a slot limit for the comorants to follow.lol   Not to mention they are destroying trees(That's even worse then destroying ther fish). I wonder what I would prefer, nice leafy trees, nice shade and a healthy forage for the fish or comorants. Its a no brainer.  Death to the comorants!"

521306,blarg,2010-11-18 23:14:00,289,"  What i find funny is people like you are so quick to blame people but unwilling to consider the solutions that people come up with.  True, we have a greater impact on the environment that just about anything else but that doesn't mean we bury our heads in the sand and ignore the problems, even those we might have created.  Btw, the seals didn't decimate the cod stocks, but they could be making it recover more slowly or perhaps not at all, if we hadn't over fished the cod it wouldn't matter, but pretending that those cute cuddly seals don't eat a ton of fish won't make the problem go away."
