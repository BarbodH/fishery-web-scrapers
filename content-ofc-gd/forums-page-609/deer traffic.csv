I'm so lucky the didn't chose the moment I came up on them!   Just a reminder to keep your eyes peeled and heads up! They are moving heavy in rut now!!!!"
522289,jbailey,2010-11-22 19:54:00,866,a friend of mine's father saw a deer jump off the QEW bridge over the credit last year... huge fall
522290,spinnerdoc,2010-11-22 20:06:00,556,i was fishing about two weeks ago and i saw a deer didn't know if it was a male or not but i was very close to it then out of nowhere this unmistacable male showed up and faked a charge...i never ran so fast in my life
522295,Rod Caster,2010-11-22 20:30:00,5784,  wow. Is your gear still on the shore?
522321,spinnerdoc,2010-11-22 22:42:00,556,i was hiking back to my car so my gear was all tucked.
522329,Canuck2fan,2010-11-22 23:03:00,1444,I used to travel about 1100Km a week on my bread route and more than once it wasn't the first deer that the other driver could see that they hit.... Each time it was the one that came out of the field chasing the does that they wound up hitting. If you see one there are likely more around.

The one guy only had his car for about a week.  Patsy also came close to one last week.  Lots of blood spatters and carcass' along the highway."
522378,misfish,2010-11-23 01:04:00,29133,  Rich I have heard many stories about the carcass on the side of your road ways. Crazy.
