USE 2 pin timers one for the transfer switch and one for the Charger, a Transfer Switch, 2 deep Cycles, Inverter a charger and a few relays and you can charge your batteries at night when the rates are cheap and use them during the day."

522282,jedimaster,2010-11-22 19:19:00,3472,The loss waas calculated for me by a top engineer at H1. Its still worth it.
522283,jedimaster,2010-11-22 19:19:00,3472,Of course that depends on how much electricity you use during the day.
