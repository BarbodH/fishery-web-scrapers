522130,Leecher,2010-11-22 00:07:00,7832,"After looking at brandon's post about the Bondy Baits shoot, was inspired in displaying the ones I built this weekend from Luremaking.com I know you've seen them but wanted to get a group shot of them all  Confidence goes a long way when firing the first cast into the water and I always use the same baits where ever I go....  I don't know why I have so many different lures in my tackle box cause some never get use and some get overuse.... here's my confident collection I made.... from cranks, spinnerbaits and slip float rigs.... enjoy!          What's your go to lures when fishing??  Leechman"
522138,mercman,2010-11-22 00:42:00,7054,impressive selection Jacques.You've become a true professional baiter.One might even say you are a Master.

522176,splashhopper,2010-11-22 03:25:00,2931,  My go to baits are:  1)top water scum frogs  2) Crankbaits  3) Senkos   I just may try making a few of those slip float rigs myself. I like how you packaged them individually too .

522273,Leecher,2010-11-22 18:41:00,7832," I love the way you worded your reply lol  Thanks Paul!!!   Thanks GoneFishin!!! much appreciated   Thanks splash!!!  The slip float rigs are very easy and cheap to make.... You'll need small hooks, pill size floats, plastic beads and mono or fluro lead depending on the species of fish you are targeting    The ones I made are for brookies so 36"" 10LBS mono lead is all I require for them little gems   Thanks Simon!!!  just fill in the form and mail it back to me   Thanks corvy!!!   Thanks Chris!!!   Thanks Terry!!! can't wait to try them   Thanks Rod Caster!!!  No, I haven't received any calls from BPS yet    Yes the chartreuse tiger pattern is the ones I will be using first next year"
