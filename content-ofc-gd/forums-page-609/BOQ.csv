521881,Terry,2010-11-21 02:24:00,14456,"We woke up to high winds  37 k and gusts to 57km so we waited till there was a bit of light before we headed out  we tried to stay on our fish from yesterday but could not do to the wind gusts. We kept trolling and after 4 hours we get our first hit, a jumbo perch.  Another hour goes buy and we start to think we may have that smell of walleye skunk but a rod goes off once again and its a big walleye but we loose it.  The smell of skunk starts to come back. 15 min later its fish on for 2.5 hours  We went 16 for 20  and I matched my PB with a 13 and a half pound monster with a 12.5 and a few nine and tens also today   most of the smaller boats hand a hard time staying on the fish do to the wild winds.     Heard Paul had a big pike to the net..there is a story going around that women on a boat is bad luck..but that is another story    and another and another    <a href=""http://s25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/?action=view&current=DSCF4041.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/DSCF4041.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>  <a href=""http://s25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/?action=view&current=DSCF4039.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/DSCF4039.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>  <a href=""http://s25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/?action=view&current=DSCF4038.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/DSCF4038.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>  <a href=""http://s25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/?action=view&current=DSCF4036.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/DSCF4036.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>  <a href=""http://s25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/?action=view&current=DSCF4050.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/DSCF4050.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>  <a href=""http://s25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/?action=view&current=IMG_3017.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/IMG_3017.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>  <a href=""http://s25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/?action=view&current=DSCF4048.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/DSCF4048.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>  <a href=""http://s25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/?action=view&current=DSCF4045.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/DSCF4045.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>"

522169,fishhunter,2010-11-22 03:01:00,604,What a great crew I had this year. Made my job very easy to stay on fish and have a very relaxing weekend.  Wayne every day we put a rod out for you and look forward to having you back on the boat next year.  Not having you and Dano out with me this year was a very strange feeling for me but we will have next year.  Get well Dano A.K.A BUBBLE BOY   LOL and good Luck Wayne with your daughter.
