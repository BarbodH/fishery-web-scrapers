522039,archer379,2010-11-21 21:11:00,277,Dave Mercer was at the Chapters book store here in Peterborough. The daughter and I headed down to get are copys of his new book to get them signed. We were the first ones in line and then stuck around for a bit until the line died off and got to spend a few minutes talking with him which was great but for the daughter made the big score of a tee shirt and a bobble head of Dave. She is going to have the best show and tell monday at school. I hope the pictures work
