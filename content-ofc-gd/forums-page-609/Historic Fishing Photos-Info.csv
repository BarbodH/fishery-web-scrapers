Here are a few links to photos and some things I have found. 1: a fishing trip photo album from 1928 http://members.shaw....easefamily.html 2:a map from the early 1900's of the ""Nepigon"" river http://members.shaw....magnifymap.html 3: the only video I know of, that shows the ""Nepigon"" prior to 1923 There is more historic stuff under other drop-down tabs about the famous river. Enjoy....Alan"
