522136,kickingfrog,2010-11-22 00:30:00,8333,Tough to say anything when you're grinning ear to ear.

522157,Gerritt,2010-11-22 02:28:00,6129,"  Shhhhh... we are not supposed to tell... for fear of torture... I was trying to keep Mike calm all weekend... I did my best...he was only holding you... but I cannot control him on OFC... please do not antagonize him further, for I fear I cannot stop the ball from rolling beyond my physical control..  Best have mom make 5 times the noodles as some sort of peace offering..   G  (PS I protected you all weekend... and not even a kiss on the cheek LOL! )  hope you had a great OFC G2G brother. Hope to see you at another!"

522164,fishhunter,2010-11-22 02:50:00,604,"Well I'm glad you all had a great time. It was a fun 3 days with all the gold as a bonus.  Its to bad everyone (OFC memebers) were not staying at the same place. Maybe next year we all can stay at the Picton Harbour Inn.  It was nice meeting some of the OFC people for dinner Sat night for dinner at JJ'S.  The boat is home now and ready for the barn this week after a few small things are done to her.  The bags are almost packed and ready for 7 days of relaxing times in Punta Cana Dec 2.  The girl friend and myself are in need of a holiday and yes a couple of those will be fishing  I thank everyone that made my season a great one and look forward to starting again May 7, 2011 on the Bay of Quinte."
522167,asdve23rveavwa,2010-11-22 02:55:00,2690,"Well done guys!!!!!!  I was darn close to calling Lloyd for that open spot.  Congrats Terry on the new PB!!!  Enjoy the time in Mexico, Lloyd!!!  A well deserved break...hope you and the girlfriend have a great time.  Looking forward to an ice fishing excursion together soon!"
522168,Gerritt,2010-11-22 02:56:00,6129,"Lloyd, have fun in PC!!! it is a blast! Are you heading out with Mike? He is awesome, did 3 charters with him in PC. Hard to go wrong!!! what are you chasing?  Nice to see you put the lads on fish!  G"

522180,danc,2010-11-22 03:45:00,4677," You're an amazing guy Lloyd. Not only can you find any and all fish in Lake Ontario, but you're the only guy on the planet to have discovered Lamprey in Lake Nipigon. None have ever been seen there before or since your visit."
522182,irishfield,2010-11-22 03:49:00,26272,His diver probably had it stuck on his suit from the last trip Dan !!
522183,GBW,2010-11-22 03:56:00,8460,I see that barn in the background...
522186,corvette1,2010-11-22 04:09:00,1765,awesome 3 days of eyes congrats to all of you
522187,danc,2010-11-22 04:16:00,4677,  lol Wayne. 70 mile x 40 mile lake and Lloyd found the only lamprey in the lake in his first hour on the lake. Impressive.

522225,Fish Farmer,2010-11-22 14:35:00,2234,"Man, you guys did good, So that's what a Walleye looks like And I had my boat put away. Looks like it's coming out early, like next week."
522275,Headhunter,2010-11-22 18:43:00,5703,"Nice job use guys! Some really sweet fish there and Terry, I think you deserve to beat up that old PB... you've earned it! I wish we could have made it out to where you were fishing, but those winds were simply too much for our 16 ft boat and by the time they switched up, we didn't have time to get out very far. Missed seeing you guys this weekend... all I can tell you is that you would have been proud of the Perfect Vue contingent as we managed to maintain OFC's reputation for being ""over served"" when more than one of us meet! LOL HH"
522276,Pigeontroller,2010-11-22 18:47:00,2793,Nice Eyes!  And some pretty good
