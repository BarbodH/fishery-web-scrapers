522056,NANUK,2010-11-21 21:59:00,797,What type/make of rod ?
522105,esoxansteel,2010-11-21 23:24:00,1307,"most rods have a piece of rubber at the bottom section where the tip joins at the ferrule its likely fallen into the blank where the diameter is larger, and it wont wont come back out as the diameter at the tip of the butt section is smaller then the rubber piece, if the rod has not buttcap and just cork you could drill a samll hole in the centre and it should fall out at the bottom then just cover the drilled hole with a new cork ring or plastic wood the same colr as the cork"
