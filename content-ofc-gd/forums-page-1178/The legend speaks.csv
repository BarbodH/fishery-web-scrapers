95148,Terry,2007-07-17 20:42:00,14456,you have entered the twilight zone .............   so how many people read this thread and part way through  stopped and tested their corn flakes for drugs..cause you just couldn't follow the thread....so you figure something was spiked with LSD
95151,Greencoachdog,2007-07-17 21:09:00,8163,I believe alot was lost in the Franch to English translation.
95156,Deg,2007-07-17 21:47:00,51,That's it Marc ...I'm really ticked at you now.  I tell you how I feel about myself and you post it on the board.  Last time I spill my inner secrets with you bud.  No more couch sessions in your boat.  Do you own a boat or borrow Roy's (he never uses it)??  a.k.a ...The Legend  P.S.  Any hints on how to catch the first muskie ... that bunch at Lakair aren't any help.  A rookie caught more than they did.  Right Cliff.

95217,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-07-18 00:20:00,0,I wonder why Marc would post this? Other than amusement value. At times I found it hilarious. Its obvious someone is envious of Marc's accomplishments.
95226,Cookslav,2007-07-18 00:37:00,1457,Yup.... You successfully confused me No idea what this is all about.

95247,Bear,2007-07-18 01:22:00,106,hey i resemble that remark   <_<  <_< only happens when  I get caught short in the boat  strange thread for sure  Bear
95252,Guest Trophymuskie,2007-07-18 01:32:00,0,   And Roy the 8:35 minor produced a pig or should off if the client had set the hook  I guess it's the downside to casting for muskies with unexperienced anglers.
95310,Nemo,2007-07-18 03:09:00,727,Gerritt that clip is hilarious I spit beer on my laptop. LOL.
