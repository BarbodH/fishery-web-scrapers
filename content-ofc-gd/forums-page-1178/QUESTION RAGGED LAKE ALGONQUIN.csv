95767,solopaddler,2007-07-19 13:18:00,8605,"Yes, excellent smallmouth fishing. Classic shield lake, so light line and natural coloured tubes and twisters work well. Live baitfish including crayfish aren't allowed, but an air injected nightcrawler on a lindy rig would be deadly for the deeper structure if they're fussy. There's catchable numbers of lakers as well, but you'd likely need to troll for them with wire line this time of year."
