95653,Rich,2007-07-19 02:07:00,3927,"Well dad and I dropped the bass boat in locally today in hopes at some largemouth. We were not disappointed.. though no big ones our total in about 2 hrs fishing was 8 bass. 6 for me, 2 for dad. Almost all on spinnerbaits, a couple on chatterbaits.  Was a good way to spend the afternoon after a long work week!    "
