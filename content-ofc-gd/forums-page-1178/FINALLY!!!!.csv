Ravine Rat had sent me a message about a 17.8ft Smoker Craft that was for sale on another board... we contacted the seller and went to see it yesterday, both Chuck and I were off by noon....so we contacted CrappieSteve and headed for his place.. We arrived at Steve's a little early to go see the boat, so Steve gave us a nice tour of his place before heading for Niagra Falls...  Here is the add on it and a pic of the guys checking it out... 1998 Smoker Craft 178 Fazer, 1998 115 Mercury elpto(LOW HOURS), 1998 Ez-Loader galvanized trailer with a spare. Full stand up top with side windows and back curtain. New(2006) Minn Kota 65lb thrust autopilot with copilot remote. Dual large live wells with timers, Guest on board 2 bank charger 10/10, 2 deep marine cycle batteries, 1 starting marine battery. 7"" Fish strike 2000 with GPS and color fish finder, hummingbird 100fx fish finder. 2 Big jon down riggers with mounts and 2 side mount rod holders. Outboard motor bracket rated for up to 20hp, and a boarding ladder. Radio/cassette player with speakers. All the safety gear is included. $15500 obo  The boat.   Checking out the moter   After leaving a deposit for the boat, Steve took us to view some beautiful sites of the Niagara Falls area.... Steve, you make a great guide, thanks for all your help and guide services and a great evening...  Here are a few picture’s of the area's that Steve took us too... what a beautiful area... I've been to Niagara Falls before, But never taking the time to view the area. I can't wait to go back for a whole day of it...  The Whirlpool    The whirlpool jet… boy, would I love to take a ride in this…  Steve say’s its pretty expensive, but it still looks like a blast…   The cable-car that brings you across the whirlpool… it looks so cool in person..   and here’s another area he took us too.. We’re looking right across at the USA…   After some site seeing we headed back to Steve’s for some Pizza and brown pops to celebrate… What a great afternoon/evening we had… Thanks again Steve…  We are planning to pick the new boat up on Friday or Saturday, …. We are so excited to have finally found something we want, we can’t wait for the weekend to come…  We arrived back home around 11 pm last night to find our wonderful neighbors enjoying a drive-in Theater in their own back yard... lol What a funny site this was.... We are so lucky to have such great neighbors, we couldn't have picked them better ourselves..  "

95632,Another Canadian,2007-07-19 01:06:00,41,"Hope you enjoy your new boat.  I have a 99 178 Fazer with a 150 Honda.  I used to have a 115 Honda on it (long story on why I switched).  You should be in the low 40's at wot with the 115.  If you have any questions about the boat, I can try and answer but you made a good decision on the purchase and price appears to be fair.  Good luck with the fishing!"
