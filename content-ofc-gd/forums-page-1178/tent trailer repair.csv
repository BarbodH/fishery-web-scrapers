My first guess was a rock hit it on the way home last week from restoule. But after sometime to think I remember last wednesday morning when we started to pack up it was extremly windy. After I removed the screen room the wind picked up the awning and threw it up over the top of the trailer with the pole hitting the roof hard. Well I never noticed the crack until today. It will need to be filled then fiberglassed. Does anyone know of someone in the London area that would do this type work. I would do it myself except I want to sell it so I want it done perfect. thanks or any suggestions."
