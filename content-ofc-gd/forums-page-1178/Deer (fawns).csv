95775,Peps,2007-07-19 14:07:00,191,"I know we have some hunters on the board, but this question is for everyone.  in your travels so far this summer has anybody seen any fawns out with any doe's?  last year around this time and in the years past i probably would have seen atleast 5 fawns through out my travels, this year i haven't seen 1 and i'm on the road alot and travel through prime deer country.   Peps"
95780,misfish,2007-07-19 14:18:00,29133,I seen 2 spotted ones.Saddly they were lying on the side of the road.  Anyone see the ones that were on the news last night? Cute little things.LOL
95781,Fish Farmer,2007-07-19 14:24:00,2234,"I seen 2 Fawns the other day on a back road near Jacks L. One ran out in front of me, just missed it. the other stayed in the ditch. I've been seeing lots of deer this year. You need to travel those back roads slow."
95797,Victor,2007-07-19 15:59:00,1609,i saw one swimming on lake dalrymple last weekend ... didn't know it was a fawn until i posted up my report  
95801,evster,2007-07-19 16:05:00,367,"I have seen a bunch, none at the farms I hunt but I have seen lots out in fields while driving.  I have also seen a lot of bucks in velvet, but none at my hunting grounds   ."
95802,Canoe2fish,2007-07-19 16:06:00,42,Too many trained Golden eagles in your area?  I've seen a few and almost hit a doe a couple of days ago.  Tons of coon & skunk road-kills ithis year it seems.
95817,Jay T,2007-07-19 16:27:00,282,"I am also a hunter, mostly compound bow and muzzleloader. I have seen 8 fawns so far and lots of bucks in velvet. I see on an average of 6-8 per day on my 2 hour journey down to TO. I already hit one but no damage was done just clipped her hoof. Also getting ready to put in a new food plot for late fall. September 15 I got my 5th fly in moose hunt and fishing trip booked and just can't wait   . I got a 900lb cow moose 4 years ago 47yrd perfect shot she didn't go 20 yrds, and we got a 52"" bull same night man what a long night that was, but OH SO worth it."
95826,Corey,2007-07-19 16:44:00,355,Was golfing in Burlington 2 weeks ago and a Doe and Fawn went walking across the 16th fairway. I wish I had a gun.  cd.
95834,nautifish,2007-07-19 16:56:00,1416,We have alot of deer in my neck of the woods and i mean alot. I have seen many does and fawns on my travels close to home this year.
95869,lew,2007-07-19 19:00:00,12767,I saw a doe & 2 small fawns standing at the side of Hwy 11 just south of North Bay last month coming down from Lakair. They weren't 20' away from the road and didn't seem the least bit concerned as they happily munched away with Mom.  I think I smiled all the way home after seeing those little guys and their proud Momma
95884,Peps,2007-07-19 19:20:00,191,"glad everybody has seen some, my timing must be off   or maybe they are just hanging around my tree stands   Peps"
95896,Whopper,2007-07-19 19:42:00,2174,"Seen a couple fawns the other day, didn't get a pic though. I see deer everyday pretty much in my travels, here a couple small bucks that I watched the other day.    "
95907,Victor,2007-07-19 20:08:00,1609,that seem to be a beautiful spot to sit in a canoe and wet a line whopper!
95911,Bernie,2007-07-19 20:14:00,3190,Stopped for two that wanted a good look at the front of my pickup on my way into work last week. My brother has also seen a few in his travels. They looked very healthy. Nice to see the fawns.
