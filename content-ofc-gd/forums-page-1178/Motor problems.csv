I'm wondering if anyone has any suggestions/recommendations/ for a shop that will fix it in the downtown Toronto to Oshawa area?  It's a 1995 Dodge Caravan with a 3.3.  I just bought it off my grandfather for next to nothing and figure it's worth spending some money on it.  He had the tranny rebuilt a couple of months ago, new exhaust, and the body work done on it last year.  The van is mint.  Well it was a couple of hours ago.  Thanks for your help."

95798,fishboy,2007-07-19 16:00:00,550,Ouch-hope that doesn't put too much of a cramp in your plans.
95853,fishnsled,2007-07-19 17:59:00,3520,  I've still got the truck so towing the boat is not a problem.    It's just the unexpected repair bill.    When are they ever expected anyways??
