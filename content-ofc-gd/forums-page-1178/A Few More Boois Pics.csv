He's third generation Booi on Trout Lake and something of a legend in those parts.      He does this neat party trick involving a double-bladed axe that he keeps in the fishcleaning hut.        I didn't believe it until I saw it.  Thanks again to Connie for your help in planning the trip."
95417,TennesseeGuy,2007-07-18 15:15:00,957,"You're welcome.  Thanks for the photos.  Jim picked up the skill from his dad, Ron Booi."

It occurred to me after seeing this post that anyone needing information about the Red Lake area should bypass all the middle men and contact Connie directly. Connie certainly seems to have his finger on the fishing pulse of NW Ontario.   addendum: It also seems to me that Connie is somewhat of a Red Lake area legend in his own right."
95420,Whopper,2007-07-18 15:29:00,2174,I heard of that before Doug but never witness that myself either Thanks for showing!  Roy there is something to be said for your statement. A lot of knowledge between the ears of TG  Whopper
95455,Nemo,2007-07-18 17:11:00,727,Is that what you call a Booi Knife??  Man that axe has got to be sharp. That Jim fellow seems like quite the character.  Bet he would have some tales to tell.
95606,Greencoachdog,2007-07-18 23:22:00,8163,Somebody buy that poor feller a fillet knife!!!... or are the knife and axe kept around for people that complain about their bill at the end of their stay?
