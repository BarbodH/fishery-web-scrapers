95852,jediangler,2007-07-19 17:54:00,1923,Just bought a minn kota fishing barometer for my family trip to Pigeon lake. Anyone know the altitude (number of feet above sea level) of the lake. You need to set this according to your region before accurate readings can be read. I looked on the weather network for Bobcaygeon and googled a few ideas before I gave up. Then I thought of asking the OFC community. I'm sure someone must know this fact. Thanks.
