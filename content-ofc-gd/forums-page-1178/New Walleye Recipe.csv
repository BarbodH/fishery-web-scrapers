95608,solopaddler,2007-07-18 23:25:00,8605,"Yeah yeah I know, I'm morphing into Martha Stewart here  , but trust me it's delicious!  Baked Walleye In Sour Cream  Salt and Pepper 1c Sour Cream 1 3lb Walleye, filleted 1/4ts Thyme 1/2c grated Parmesan Cheese 2tb Finely minced onion 1/2c breadcrumbs 2tb soft butter 2tb lemon juice 5 strips of bacon  Salt and pepper the fish. Mix minced onions and butter and spread on both sides of the fish. Lay the bacon strips on the bottom of a shallow baking dish and lay in the fish skin side down. In a bowl mix the sour cream, thyme, grated cheese, bread crumbs, and lemon juice and spread mixture over the fish. Bake at 325 for 30 mins, give or take.  Mmmmm..... (side note: it just scored me major brownie points with my wife....something to consider if you're married  )"

95624,Shelley Cooper,2007-07-19 00:15:00,394,LOL... I'm married....I think I'll try it....  Sounds yummy...  Thanks for sharing...
95625,Nemo,2007-07-19 00:18:00,727,Filleted with Skin on or off?  Sounds good I have evrything in the fridge but the Walleye - dang.
95628,solopaddler,2007-07-19 00:45:00,8605," Well actually the recipe called for ""scaled, filleted and skin left on"" I was too lazy to scale the fish and didn't want to leave the skin on so I used regular fillets and it tasted great. Still put skin side down so they don't curl up though.  (If you're close to Dundas stop by, you can have some of my fillets  )"
95630,Nemo,2007-07-19 01:00:00,727,Thanks Solo I will keep that in mind. Maybe I'll bring some Steam Whistle and you can demostrate your technique.....

95636,Daplumma,2007-07-19 01:13:00,1961,"Hey Dawg..ESAD!I got yer Suzy Homemaker son!By the way,sounds like a good recipe but not too many 3 lb walleyes here. Joe"
95646,Greencoachdog,2007-07-19 01:38:00,8163,"   If I remember correctly... there weren't that many Walleyes of any size for you on the West Arm either!!!   btw... glad to see you're feeling well enough to ""try"" to insult me... was gettin' worried about ya there for awhile."

95675,solopaddler,2007-07-19 03:03:00,8605," Sadly, there's some truth to that statement, although I still fish way more than all my other married friends combined   . Looking forward to the day when my kids are old enough to join me as well."
95701,lookinforwalleye,2007-07-19 10:50:00,4399, I don`t think you need Walleye with all that other stuff on the Walleye you probably couldn`t tell it`s a Walleye anyways!
