95656,GNODDY,2007-07-19 02:19:00,163,Takin the wife out fishing this weekend and can't decide where to go. I live in Oshawa and dont mind driving an hour or so. We usually fish Rice only because we have a cottage there but I want to try something else. Any tips would be great and knowledge of a boat launch would really help as well. I am sure on of the kawarthas is where we will end up but just not sure where to go for a launch spot.  Cheers  G noddy

You can be on Scugog at launch in town or Cesarea in 1/2 hour-better choice most years for weeknight get away. Were close to Kawartha's-bottom of Clear lake launch puts you on Stony also-just past Young's point lock.  Pigeon-Buckhorn etc are all an hour and half pulling a trailer-lots of options.
