But this is the first full week I have had off in 5 years years and it feels great!!!  Out with the kids at the park, fishing, swimming, went down to BPS for a walk around - might even have a few pops tonite!!!  May be the last time I get this much time with my kids for a long time - but all in all  -  feeling better - NO STRESS  So - gonna keep looking for a job, but also enjoy my time!!!!  Even have time to scout for the fall deer season -  Still looking though - if anyone hears of anything on the north of 401 to Barrie area - keep me posted. - thanks   So  todayI am off to get some whitefish - and relax  Later . . . .
