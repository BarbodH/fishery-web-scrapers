He sits in the back of the room, drinking a sip out of each one in turn. When he finishes them, he comes back to the bar and orders three more. The bartender approaches and tells the Newfie, ""You know, a mug goes flat after I draw it. It would taste better if you bought one at a time.""  The Newfie replies, ""Well, you see, I have two brothers.  One's in Come by Chance and the other's in Cornerbrook. Before I left home, we promised each other that we'd drink this way to remember the days when we drank together.  So I'm drinkin' one beer for each of my brothers and one for meself."" The bartender admits that this is a nice custom and leaves it at that.  The Newfie becomes a regular in the bar, and always drinks the same way.  He orders three mugs and drinks them in turn.  One day, he comes in and only orders two mugs.  All the regulars take notice and fall silent.  When he comes back to the bar for the second round, the bartender says,  ""I don't want to intrude on your grief,  but I wanted to offer my condolences on your loss.""  The Newfie looks quite puzzled for a moment,  but then a light dawns in his eyes and he laughs.  ""Oh, no, everybody's just fine,"" he explains,  ""It's just that me wife and I joined the Baptist Church and I had to quit drinkin'."" ""Hasn't affected me brothers though.""  Hope you enjoyed! HH"
