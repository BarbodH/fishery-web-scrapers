So, now I got a little catching up to do.  A couple of weeks ago, I went off to the Grand River downstream of Caledonia to wade the river for some Bass.  The morning was pretty warm and the skies blue.   I threw on the waders and rigged up my rod with a small slip foat and stared to drift the pools and runs with crawlers.  Although I didn't manage to catch any giants that morning, I did hook into a bunch of 10 to 12 inch Smallies which the river is famous for.   Standing waist deep in a pool with a Smallmouth on the end or your line jumping at eye level gives you a feeling of hand-to-hand combat.  lol   They use the current to their advantage and I can't imagine a more fun way to spend a morning.   I was joined by another couple of anglers who took their place on the river near me.  I watched one of the fellows catch a release a nice 4lb (?) Catfish and I was a bit envious.   Plenty of fish to keep it interesting including Smallmouth, one Sucker and, of course, plenty of 'The World's Greatest Sportfish!'   I think the best part of the outing was when I hooked into the walleye, though.  It only measured a foot but it was the first walleye I had caught in several years on the Grand, so it was a welcomed sight on the end of my line.   Well, certainly no bruisers on this day but a good morning on the river, none the less.  Cheers!"
