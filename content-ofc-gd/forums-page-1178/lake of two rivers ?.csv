Decent SM bass.. caught a 3lb once... use jigs or fat raps near drop offs  there lakers too...and since it's been a coolish month, you should still be able to get em near the surface while slowly trolling along in a canoe - caught one in July on an AC shiner few years back...also try williams half-half...and add some drop weight ir other weight...maybe even a 3 way swivel and drop weight"
