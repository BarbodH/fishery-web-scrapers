93448,John,2007-07-12 19:57:00,2956,"Anything works for me Tony, except it'll have to be after 8.30 if it's before August 14th. No prob either way just save some for me.........."
93453,bigbuck,2007-07-12 20:45:00,2449,"I'll definitely try to come out, depends on work commitments and if the zookeeper lets me out to play."
93713,tonyb,2007-07-13 18:18:00,1637,"So far looking like the 31st, but it's spread out pretty evenly...Should we look further ahead into August or September?  Maybe we could have another swill in September?..Then go night fishing for Salmon from the Pier after to work off the chicken wing & beer coma before driving home (The Firehall is literally across the street from the lake)"
93714,John,2007-07-13 18:23:00,2956,One a month would be swell!
93728,bowshep,2007-07-13 19:04:00,378,"have one in July and every two months after that, have it in different locations to have more people comming out for the events if it is closer to their home. who ever lives near the location can pick out the swill house. You can also be talking deals with the swill house because of the numbers of people that show up. Maybe have OFC product to sell maybe a door prize of fishin stuff. Maybe start up a conservation group or a action group.  Peace Ken"

95146,tonyb,2007-07-17 20:39:00,1637,You could organize one for the Southwestern ON folks Nauti...All you need is a place that has cold beer and hot wings...shouldn't be too hard  Tony
