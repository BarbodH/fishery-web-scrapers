95763,BLACKFISH88,2007-07-19 13:11:00,191,^^^^^Now this man knows his beer Moosehead for sure  Sleeman honeybrown and I also enjoy a heineken every once in awhile as for the cheap beers I enjoy the BOH. Most will turn up their nose at the BOH but I love it.
95787,Fish Farmer,2007-07-19 14:51:00,2234,"There all good, but some taste better than others. My pick Coors Light."
95794,fishergirl72,2007-07-19 15:38:00,455,"My favorite is Coors light or Corona. I cannot have regular beer at all, I have a few sips and then get a whopping headache for some reason, so I have to stick to the light."
95799,fishboy,2007-07-19 16:03:00,550,Steamwhistle and Moosehead are nice beers but the best deal out there now is Brava.
95804,Canoe2fish,2007-07-19 16:08:00,42," I love that stuff! Too bad I have to drink that cheap light beer though. (If I have to drink water instead of real beer, I opt for cheap)"
95846,English,2007-07-19 17:44:00,90," Sure will john, looking forward to knocking the froth off one soon  In the summer, if we ever have one this year, I really like Magners Irish Cider, astonishingly expensive but tastes like angels dancing on your tongue, bottle of that poured over a half pint of ice mmmmmmmmmm. The breakfast lagers you can keep them, Carlsberg, Heineken, Fosters etc most of the english beers are only fit for cooking with. The real ales are something else old peculiar and old thumper, Spitfire et al,  says it all really i get a head ache just ordering them :whistling  Regards Clive"
95849,rickster,2007-07-19 17:49:00,495,I will probably get flack for this but a cold Blue light for me please and if I am watching my pennies I will get Lakeport
95866,scuro,2007-07-19 18:50:00,386," Set a limit on Christmas presents, make your own coffee, hang out your clothes to dry,...but never skimp on beer and buy Lakeport!"
95876,blaque,2007-07-19 19:13:00,2419,Coors light around the camp fire in the summer.......One tall cold Black and Tan after hitting the slopes!! (guiness and bass ale on tap) Its almost like a cold coffee
95881,rickster,2007-07-19 19:17:00,495,"Set a limit on Christmas presents, make your own coffee, hang out your clothes to dry,...but never skimp on beer and buy Lakeport!  Well said scuro"
95883,John,2007-07-19 19:18:00,2956," I heard that summer was a mere dream right now, hope things improve soon as I will be over there in a month or two. I'm pretty much a real ale man myself to wash down those Lincolnshire links............"

95957,bronzeback,2007-07-19 22:32:00,30,Stella would be my first pick closely followed by Guinness.  Some of the cheap domestics are surprisingly good.  Lakeport Lager is my current choice when pennies count.
95962,PatB,2007-07-19 22:47:00,104,"Jack Daniels... Sorry wrong thread...........  Out dining on wings, Rickards Red..."
96029,Muskieman,2007-07-20 00:10:00,2472,"I used to drink Molson EX, i rediscovered Red Cap last summer, pretty good if you ask me or probably any Ale drinker , get this they still come in stubby bottles, and now have Bob&Doug McKenzie labels on 'em, take off EH! pretty much any Ale is my choice, followed closely by ""Training Beer"" like Corona ,Sol ,Carib. I also like the imports from Germany and Holland. and i cannot forget ""La Fin Du Monde"" and ""Maudite "" wich are brewed in Quebec. If you go out west you can also count on a good ale called ""Kootenay"""
95567,steve_paul,2007-07-18 21:39:00,658," Not sure about a varied palate Nemo but I sure hope if that is stocked in your fridge you always have a good supply of TP on hand at home.  Myself, I am cheap and prefer the $10 savings every case - Laker Lite here (have to maintain this panther like physique some how)"
95569,kennyman,2007-07-18 21:43:00,737,"I like Caffreys and Bass. I also tried a Czech beer last week. It was pretty good. Called Czechsov or something like that. (No, not from Star Trek LOL)."
95570,lunkerbasshunter,2007-07-18 21:46:00,2585,coors light here!
95572,Corey,2007-07-18 21:53:00,355,"There's only 2 kinds of beer... beer ya pay for and beer ya don't. The second kind is the best.  If I am buying beer, I am buying Blue, grew up on it. With that said, I have been known to enjoy 50 and OV. MGD and Kokanee have been beers of choice in the past while bar hopping. Coors light is a goto beer when you are out. Pretty much every bar has Coors Light on tap.  Depending on the company coming over, I will occasionally buy Lakeport as well, if we are drinking for the sake of drinking."
95574,John,2007-07-18 21:57:00,2956,
95575,John,2007-07-18 21:59:00,2956," Oops, let's try that again. I'm with kennyman on this one. Waaaay too much carbonation in""all yall's beer""."

95589,motv8tr,2007-07-18 22:28:00,2587,"Hmmm...well being Irish, I honestly prefer Guiness, but since you can't get real Guiness out of a bottle or can I'd have to go with Rikard's Red, and the cheap beer of choice is a cold Coors light.  marueen"

95604,Gerritt,2007-07-18 23:19:00,6129,"For you IPA guys.....  I like IPA's as well... and a couple others. If you think  Keiths is so-so you will Love Maclays!!! and it is cheap less then 30.00 a case.. and it is made by Sleemans.. Imagine that! Sleemans makes a discount beer   I have turned many a friend onto Maclays..  Next time your at the beer store ask for it. It will be WELL worth it.  I also like Guiness, Kilkenny, Smitwicks and a bunch of other darks... but who can afford em!  Gerritt."
95609,JerseyDog,2007-07-18 23:26:00,190," No worries, I'm 35 and I've probably had enough for the both of us."
95610,Ben_Daniels,2007-07-18 23:36:00,435,"Im not a big fan of Canadian beer, soo budweiser... but when im in the states i really like Michelob AmberBock."
95612,xrap,2007-07-18 23:43:00,683,"Canadian beer sucks, tastes too much like water. I'll stay with Polish beer, Lech is my choice."
95613,fishdawg,2007-07-18 23:43:00,912,"been a coupla months since we last a saw post like this... nonetheless, I love my beer. Lately I have been with the DanC programe been drinking Brava the last coupla months - a good summer beer put out by Lakeport McLays is good as well as is Laker & Lakeport Red are both decent & a fave lager of mine Alberta's Best (another buck'a beer)  when I am in the pub & drinking draft I treat myself and have Keiths, Creemore or Kilkenny"
95616,Nemo,2007-07-18 23:48:00,727, Hey Steve no probs with either brand on the way in or out.  You just haven't acclimatized to it yet.  Laker though that's a different story...  Laker Lite never tried it but if it gives you a panther like physique I might just have to get me a case.  You only have so much time alloted to drink Beer better make it the good stuff.
95618,daisy_girl58,2007-07-19 00:00:00,116,"Well guys  I am putting in my 2 cents.....I love the beer my husband makes here at home....Our freinds even love it! We have lagers-dark or bock (my fave)-red-wheat-cream......Now I can not hardly drink the store brands, but if I do it is Richards dark beer.....  Lorissa....Cheers!"
95621,Moosebunk,2007-07-19 00:11:00,3970,"When home from work it's Moosehead time, and if quite sunny and hot then a Corona with lime. A Molson over Labbatt's is pretty much a crime, yet if it's a pint at the bar then whatever saves a dime."
95626,moosehead,2007-07-19 00:37:00,90,Moosehead for me
95634,fishindevil,2007-07-19 01:09:00,6254,"Gerritt,you are right...macklays beer.  ....its really good people dont know what they are missing,oh wellat least we know right!!!!!! cheers,oh ya im going to get some right now thanks gerritt"
95674,Crazyhook,2007-07-19 03:02:00,1154,still trying to find one I don't like!
95676,Mike the Pike,2007-07-19 03:06:00,3421, You got that right Mike my beer of choice is Labatt Blue $22.34 a case of 24.I can buy it at the corner store around the corner 200 metres away. The reason beer is so high in Ontario is because you have beer stores with Goverment workers.And thats the way it should stay preserve the Ontario jobs.I will take orders for lakair next year  MTP  LABATT BLUE.TRADITION
95680,Burtess,2007-07-19 03:19:00,901,"Honestly I don't know how you guys drink Lakeport, taste like donkey piss to me!!  For a mass produced Canadian brew I will take an Export   any day of the week.  I tried Steelback when I portaged through Algonquin (plastic bottles) but this stuff is like wet socks!  For a staple that you can drink in the summer, winter, chilled or warm, Warsteiner kicks ass....., German though....  Burt"
95681,Marty,2007-07-19 03:28:00,873,"Raf, I can tell you've been hanging with JP.  What's the word on Kokanee?  I had it for the first time last year and it wasn't too bad.    I prefer Blue."
95684,scuro,2007-07-19 03:45:00,386,"Beer.  I've sampled many. It would be a crime not to mention GERMAN beer. With 6 hundred indepedent breweries they have come up some great beers. Virtually any German or Chec beer is good. It's a quality thing. In both countries no ingredient besides hops, water, and barley may be used. It was a law they introduced back in 1516 called the Reinheits Gebot. Germany did not allow any imported beer into Germany that did not follow that law, I'm not sure if they still follow this practice. This law barred out all English beer but not Guinness. All major label US and Canadian beer add adjuncts. Then again so do Belgium beers but they do it increase the quality of the beer, not to produce more profit. My favorite beer is Pilsner Urquel. My favorite domestic beer was Upper Canada when it first came out, then they changed it and ruined it. I will drink most beers as long as they are cold. I will not drink any beer produced by Dave Nichols and generally any beers made in Hamilton which almost always suck."
95757,Bitsmith2k,2007-07-19 13:03:00,396, great beer..
95497,Bcee,2007-07-18 19:35:00,25,"Just curious.  I am a Molson Golden fan, but domestically (US based) I am drinking IPA beers, very hoppy.  2 best, IMHMFGDO are DogFish Head 90 minute IPA and Great Lakes Commander Perry IPA.  Which Canadian beer are you drinking and are IPA's becoming more popular in Canada?"
95501,English,2007-07-18 19:40:00,90,Sorry British officionado passing through  STELLA is the beer of choice here

95508,Nemo,2007-07-18 19:46:00,727,"India Pale Ale = IPA  but I will second on the Stella in Summer and Kilkenny in the cooler months. As for Canadian beer OV, Kokanee. How's that for a varied palate."
95509,John,2007-07-18 19:47:00,2956,India Pale Ale........  Stella!!!!!!! wash your mouth out Clive!
95511,Headhunter,2007-07-18 19:48:00,5703,"I like all beers, as long as they ""taste cold"" LOL IPA is India Pale Ale and yes, Labatts still makes it and it's now becoming trendy to be seen drinking any IPA beer! Edit... you guys are to quick for me! HH"
95512,misfish,2007-07-18 19:48:00,29133,Oh I forgot about SCHOONER. Me bro likes that.

95529,ozaibak1,2007-07-18 20:12:00,401,"Canadian beer eh? Well definately better than American beer, however I find the popular big 2 (Labatt, Molson) to be a NATIONAL SHAME.  I like Moosehead, most of the honey browns especially sleemans, Coors if u can consider it canadian since they merged, I dont like Rickards at all. I like Lakeport, I havent tried too many Canadian beers I tend to stick with European or tropical flavors."
95530,mrdylan,2007-07-18 20:16:00,111,I'm Canadian and I like Bud.  Sorry everyone lol

95535,joefish,2007-07-18 20:28:00,165,I'm with Raf!!!!!!!!!!!!
95542,misfish,2007-07-18 20:53:00,29133,"Steam whistle great pilsner,but gives me a headach after 6."
95549,danc,2007-07-18 21:15:00,4677," 6 Steam Whistle is about all I can afford. What is that stuff, like $42.00 a case?? No thanks. My favorite beer is anything that doesn't cost me more than $26.40 per case. And there's a good selection of them these days. I think there's 3 or 4 on Ontarios top 10 sellers list right now."
95558,solopaddler,2007-07-18 21:23:00,8605," Yeah, it's pricey, but then how does one put a price on perfection? When I head to my cabin in N/W Quebec ALL beer purchases are done there. For those that don't know beer is waaay cheaper in QC compared to Ontario. 24 cans of Coors cost me $19.99 when I was there last week. If you look around you'll find it even cheaper on sale. Bottles are even cheaper... Gotta love Quebec if you're a beer drinker!"
95562,Weeds,2007-07-18 21:31:00,782,I figure having a bad beer is a lot like having a bad day while fishing. A pretty rare occurence. They all good..
95563,Woodsman,2007-07-18 21:33:00,1286,I like Lucky. Actually enjoying a couple right now.
95566,danc,2007-07-18 21:36:00,4677, Ditto. And ditto.
