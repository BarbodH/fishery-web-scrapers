96149,MJL,2007-07-20 04:02:00,2427,I haven't fished North Tea lake before but if it's a typical shield lake - like many of the other lakes along the highway - you can't go wrong using soft-plastics that imitate leeches and crayfish for the smallies (eg. black curly tail jigs and brownish-coloured tubes).  I have also done well using the standard Rapalas and twitching them on the surface in the early morning and at dusk.

White and black grubs alwasy a go to for me in APP for Bass.  Lakers you want to be deep this time of year 30 - 45 feet.  Good Luck and let us know how you do.
