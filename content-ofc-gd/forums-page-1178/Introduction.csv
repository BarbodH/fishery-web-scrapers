95665,pat,2007-07-19 02:36:00,1,Hello I have been a member for quite a while and thought I should finally get around to introducing myself! My name is  Pat and I live in Hamilton. I have always been into fishing but found that I would go a few years not getting out there so last year my wife and I purchased a small boat and I referbished an older Roadtrek camper van. We have spent most of our vaction weeks fishing since then and found the postings on this site a real help!! Looking forward to adding to the discussions when I can! Thanks!
