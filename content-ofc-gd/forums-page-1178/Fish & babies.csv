They always ask "" HOW BIG WAS IT ???    HOW MUCH DID IT WEIGH????  Would it not save lotsa money to at that point just havem stuffed & mounted on the wall ????   No clothes, no shoes, no college fund.  Might be enough saved to buy a NEW BOAT   Just kidding, I wouldn't trade any of em in.  Well then again; a NEW BOAT"
