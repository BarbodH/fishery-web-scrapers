From what I've heard, fishing 15-20ft of water off the south shores of the lake should produce some, I will be starting out at Bewdley on a cheap rental boat with no trolling motor.  I am considering using minnows on a regular hook, spinners tipped with worms, spinners tipped with minnows. Do I have the right approach? Or would you recommend anything else, I'm most comfortable fishing soft plastics would these work?  Thx for any help."

95951,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-07-19 22:19:00,0,Great article Ranger!I have never had big pickeral numbers on Rice. Once I watched a guy rip jigging and was catching one after another. He was just drifting and ripping. Not sure they if were all pickeral but sure looked like it.
95984,solopaddler,2007-07-19 23:06:00,8605," I've targeted walleye several times on Rice and at least for me rippin' a bucktail jig through the weeds (not so much edges, but big weedy flats 10-15' deep) has been BY FAR the most productive technique. It's kinda hard to get the technique down, somewhat similar to working a jerkbait back to the boat. I like a short, stiff spinning rod and 10lb mono when fishing this way... Probably any quality bucktail will work, but these are the ones I use, with black/green/white colour being especially effective on Rice.  "
95993,solopaddler,2007-07-19 23:16:00,8605,"Didn't realize that ranger posted that article he wrote about rip jiggin'   , I missed it as I scrolled through the post. That's some great info there!"
