The TRAA gang met up at the hatchery at the crack of 7 this morning, about 10 guys dragged themselves out of bed to be there on time, (I was not one of them) My wife elbowed my at 6:50 this morning and asked me if I was supposed to be fishing right now  D'OH!  get dressed, hit timmies, get to the river  at about 7:30 and the guys were already geared up and headed down . This year started off with slow with the guys getting a few smallmouth, and then a few silver bass and then a few walleye, After about 2 hours of drifting single eggs, I decided to switch up to some plastics I brought and get me a nice bass or 2.  That didn't happen, but seeing that it was the Trout derby I did manage one small walleye about 10-11"" on a 5"" soft plastic swimbait. About 10:45 I cast out into the faster water and just as I flipped my bail closed line started screaming off the reel Fish On! I hadn't even started reeling yet.  Here's the results.  Some times it pays to sleep in!  Thanks to Beats for taking the pics for me       jjcanoe"
