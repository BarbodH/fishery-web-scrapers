397974,bigugli,2009-10-31 01:05:00,6138,"We had a whole colony in the farmhouse decades back one winter. They started chewing through wires. Put out a live trap, baited with peanut butter, in the summer pantry. They'd get trapped at night and some wound up as squirrelsickles by morning. IT was down to  -20 a couple of nights. By the time we were done we had trapped and released 15 or so plus the squirrelsickles."
397978,GBW,2009-10-31 01:14:00,8460,"never in the house or cottage, just in the boat house.  let me tell you, when they get in there and can't find a way out or food look out.  I opend the door (hadn't been there in 2 weeks) to see the fishing rods all over the floor and this wee guy/gal dead at the boat doors with it's head up to the door.  I guess it noticed it was stuck, freaked out and went full speed into the door and died.  so far, that's 2 this year that have done that..."

397986,crappieperchhunter,2009-10-31 01:27:00,2582,Black squirrels in our attic 3 years ago...don't know how many...just heard them skampering around UP THERE. The little buggers took ALL the pink blown in insulation  and piled it up in one corner of the attic above my daughters bedroom...making a nest I suppose?The rest of the attic was void of insulation.  I took a radio up there with and extension cord and left it in there with the volume turned up high for 2-3 weeks. Haven't seen them since. Guess they didn't like my radio station
397988,BillM,2009-10-31 01:29:00,17367,"Red squirrels are the best..  There are a couple around my parents place that have been there for a while.  No fear at all..  When my dad refills the bird feeders, they get about 2-3ft away from him and squak up a storm!"
397990,redneck666,2009-10-31 01:30:00,563,"lol well my neighbour feeds the black squirrels and now on occasion when the blacks arent around he feeds the reds. he's got this little box set up with a lid on hinges so the squirrel just flips up the lid climbs right in grabs a few peanuts and runs off. and when there are no peanuts left in the box they wait at his door. this guy is damn near 100 years old and he's in fantastic shape! only looks about 76..... does everything himself except for cook cause he lives with his daughter.  just thought i'd share that, lol."

398318,hawkeye,2009-11-01 14:42:00,162,"We had a chipmunk in the basement a few weeks ago. Unfortunately I have 3 cats and I couldn't trap the little bugger before they did what cats do. This is the first live critter these cats have seen. The reaction was humorous, but nor for the chipmunk. The Norwegian Forest cat was on it in a minute, the Maine Coon rocked back on her haunches and then took up the chase. Our big male siberian.......... ran up the stairs"
398346,OhioFisherman,2009-11-01 16:58:00,6623,"Had a chipmunk in a cabin we rented in Pointe Au Baril one time, a trail of grapes and an open door got it out."
398383,oates,2009-11-01 22:34:00,151,"yes, two of them, scratched the carpet beneath a door, wrecked, ate bottom of door wrecked it, pooed all over the place. I was trying to hit them with a bat by the end of it, had no mercy."
