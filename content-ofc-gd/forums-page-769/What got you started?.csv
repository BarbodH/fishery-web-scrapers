396854,mojobass,2009-10-27 23:01:00,34,I started by just seeing a local fisherman fishing at a pond fishing for carp. My cousins and I decided to make our own fishing rods with broom stick and tied rope on to a safety pins with bread at the end and started to catch carp at a local pond with my cousins when we were 8.
396858,irishfield,2009-10-27 23:14:00,26272,"I think growing up with the Rideau River flowing past our back yard had a lot to do with it. We swam in it or fished it almost every day. Really wonder what we were thinking swimming in it 40 years ago...    It's, somewhat, cleaner now..."
396861,MCTFisher9120,2009-10-27 23:17:00,3761,Papa and Dad didn't get alone for a long time so My mom got the idea to get them fishing together. Guess who came with? I was about 5 or 6 when I went and it was Lake Scugog as I remember. Caught a pumpkin seed from the picture in my mind.
396888,laszlo,2009-10-28 00:25:00,487,"For me it was when I was 11 years old living in a very small town (Scotland Ontario) with very little to do. My best friend at the time Chris and I would ride our bikes around finding endless ponds, lakes, rivers and creeks. For 3 summers we fished almost everyday. Eventually I stepped away from fishing to discover new things but over the last 5 years the passion has come back and I'm loving every moment.  Now I just have to learn how to fish for Steelhead. Let's just say it's been a bit of a struggle but I still have plenty of fight left in me. Believe me, all of you will know when I have success (a report will quickly follow)."

396907,mikeh,2009-10-28 01:32:00,824,"I had an aunt and uncle who owned a cottage in the Port Mcnicoll area and I spent about 5 weeks of the summer there plus every weekend , and fished alot . When I was 16 they bought me a boat (12 foot aluminum and 6 hp chrysler) and I fished as long as it wasn't rough. I'd get up in the morning and go catch my minnows and go fishing, the bass and pike were plentiful back in those days. It's still one of my favourite places to fish."
396913,ciceri,2009-10-28 01:43:00,535,"Like everything, my bestfriend (my dad) got me started."
396968,Dabluz,2009-10-28 03:15:00,701,"I started real early too.  I was 2.  My dad would stand me up in his pack sack and we would go creek fishing for brook trout.  Went walleye fishing when I was 3 and mom never knew how dangerous that spot was.  Fishermen can no longer fish from that spot....too many fell into the rapids and drowned.  Went fishing almost every time my dad went.  Then, when I was about 5, I started to go fishing by myself.  My dad was a travelling salesman in those days.  I either fished for chub near the house or took my bike to fish in a big creek about 2 miles away for turtles, chub and sheephead.  At around 8 years old, we moved to Ottawa so I did a lot of fishing from shore for bass and catfish.  We moved to Amherstview just outside of Kingston when I was 16.  From age 8 till age 20, I did a lot of fishing and camping and hunting with my Dad and sometimes with him and his buddies.  Anyway, from age 8, I did not need help, kept a low profile, bought my own stuff etc, took care of myself and didn't bother anybody so I was always invited to tag along.  When in Kingston, I often went fishing by myself on Lake Ontario.  I used to carry the 7 1/2 Evinrude, tank and fishing equipment to the lake and borrow a small aluminum boat or just fished from shore.  I'm 62 now and still fish at least 3 times a week, year round.  My son fishes quite a bit and my daughter likes to fish but her husband doesn't fish.  My grand daughter who is 5 has been fishing with me since she was 2.  Contrary to my Dad, I like to eat fish often.  I guess he ate too many fish during the depression.  He died about 15 years ago."
397052,tonyb,2009-10-28 15:16:00,1637,"You guys have some great stories!  For me it all began as a kid peering into the water off the end of the dock at my grandmas cottage on Manitoulin Island and seeing fish hiding out in the rock cribs supporting the dock.  Nobody really fished in the family, so I was on my own to learn and experiment, so I went searching for gear and found a rusty metal tacklebox with various scraps of tackle and hooks and an old baitcaster with dacron line on it in the garage that was collecting dust and cobwebs.  I tied a hook on it and flipped rocks to find critters for bait that I would impale the hook.  One day I finally caught a fish, a smallmouth bass. I remember it darting around and really pulling hard and even jumping! my heart was racing and i finally dragged it into the shallows and picked it up to admire how cool it looked, I even ran up to the cottage to show everyone what I had caught...and that day was the start of my lifelong addiction to fishing.  We are truly lucky to experience all the beautiful things that occur when you are on the water fishing, a lot of experiences most people will never have in their entire lifetime.  Keep fishing and see you on the water Tony"
397131,Dabluz,2009-10-28 21:02:00,701,"I'm surprised at how many young guys that have never done any fishing.  Somehow, they end up going fishing with me.  I guess the fact that I have been involved with a bunch of associations, been on t.v. and newspapers and even in schools plus the fact that I was an auxiliairy conservation officer and taught gun safety and now in a bunch of discussion forums has been the reason I meet so many newbies.  Anyway, most of those young guys in their mid twenties have become maniacs and good fishermen too.  I always try to get them to bring their wives and show them that it's more important for the wife to have fun at first, if they want to be able to go fishing more often.  The good thing about going fishing with a person with lots of experience is the fact that the learning curve is sharp.  I've had some guys who I took shopping for fishing stuff because they didn't even have any to start with.  So you can imagine when you start out with decent equipment and you get to go fishing where there are fish....the fishing disease takes hold real fast.  When I take kids fishing, I give them a lot of stuff to keep.  When I met my wife over 30 years ago, she had 9 brothers and sisters.  None of them ever went fishing or camping in their lives.  They all hated winter.  Now, many have cottages and every weekend....all year round, they go to their cottages and all have VTTs and snowmobiles.  Winter is welcome now.  If you do an internet search for ice fishing on the Saguenay River (pÃªche blanche au Saguenay) you will see that it's a huge tourist industry.  Yep.....I was the one who started it all, a little over 30 years ago.  I was the first one to punch a hole through the ice and catch cod, halibut, ocean perch, ling cod, etc etc, in the deep salt water parts of the Saguenay river.  Very few people have actually started by themselves."
398209,raptorfan,2009-10-31 22:18:00,126,"thanks for all the fantastic responses.  Was great to read something about everyone, rather than an arguement about the tribs and how to fish them.  My impression of the forum sure has changed back to what it was the first day I joined."
398392,oates,2009-11-01 22:52:00,151,"My first fishing experience was in 1989 I believe, I was 9 at the time, It was pouring rain (that isn't a factor where I'm from, it rains 265 days a year, that is, days where precip. is recorded), or as we call it 'lashing', It was with my grandfather, he was around 72 at the time, strong as an ox (worked in the shipyard that built the titanic), we fished of a dock, must have been 30ft to the water, fishing for I don't know what in the North Sea (between N. Ireland and Scotland) on N. Ireland's North East coast. He was having great trouble with the reel I remember, cursing at it here and there, lots of tangles must have been old line. We fished for about 4hrs in pouring rain, as we were leaving, around 20 or so sea lions popped up and started squaking at us, no wonder he didn't catch anything!  Fast forward about 19 yrs to Canada, a friend of mine asked me to go with him, for me, it was more about getting out and about, not so much fishing. We were looking for a spot to fish near Rice Lake, eventually we found a near empty campground, at the bottom was the Otanabee (hope I got that right) River, which drains in to Rice Lake. We looked for someone in charge, no one around, so we began fishing, I didn't know how to cast but he showed me, I was throwing out live minnows on a hook, the water was choppy, about 10 mins in, I hooked in to a walleye, didn't really know how, i just felt a tug and got him in, maybe 1.5 lb - he didn't catch an walleye, just a bass (out of season, went back in).  As we were leaving, he was cleaning the fish, then his car alarm went off, I said 'that's it, you've done it now' and next thing buddy comes down on his ATV ordering us out and something about cops. I remember the excitement of that catch, intrigued me, in the last two years, I have been fishing a lot, learnt a lot, its quite the science and great stress relief - so in summary  a- the thrill of the catch (first time out!) b- wanting to explore my roots (grew up on an island with fresh and salt water fishing, both my grandfather and uncle were in to fishing, mainly trout/salmon)"
398420,Radnine,2009-11-01 23:40:00,1538,"I guess the fishing/boating/cottage thing set in with me when I would go to Bobcaygeon with my buddy Mike's family. I have written about it before on here so I will save all of you the gushy romanticized details. But some of my fondest life memories are of the those trips with them. Later when we were older, my buddies and I would go on our own and rent cottages to fish, but would mainly drink and play cards. I mean, we would fish, but looking back it was no wonder that we never caught anything. But my recent complete immersion into the sport was inspired by the relationship between my brother-in-law and his son, and the relationship that I hope to have with my son. Since getting into fishing in a bigger way I have enjoyed many trips with my family, my brothers-in-law, and with just Will and I. And now when I go with the boys, we still drink and play cards, but we also catch some fish! Life is good. And this thread is great! Thanks for posting. Jim"
398455,Bernie,2009-11-02 00:34:00,3190,Where I grew up as a young lad I thought everybody HAD to fish. I got quite sick of fishing actually. But in my late 20's got back into it in a big way. I still go fishing but not as much as I used to. Almost 53 now.
396611,raptorfan,2009-10-27 00:58:00,126,"It is always interesting to find out how people come to love certain hobbies, objects or what not.  I thought it would be nice to hear others stories, and thought I would share my own in the process.  I grew up in a single parent family, just my mother and I.  She was rather unestablished in her adult life when she had me, so we spent our first 4 years of my life living at my grandparents house.  My grandfather was an avid outdoorsman, loved hunting and fishing.  Every weekend he would be out at some special fishing hole, and alot of weeknights as well.  They lived in Falkland, Ontario which is just a stones throw from the Grand River, Nith River, Hornors Creek, Whitemans Creek, and lots of other waterways.  My grandfather was also an honorary lifetime member, and executive at the Brant Rod and Gun Club, as well as a long serving member of the OAHA.  He tried to pass his love for fishing on to me very early in life, and it worked.  We would go down to a small pond across the road to get minnows, then hit some spot.  My first major memory though came on one of our very frequent summer camping trips.  We would usually go north for a few weeks in the summer, but this one week really sticks in my head.  I was about 4 years old (1982), and we went north to his favorite campground, Restoule Provincial Park.  The whole family went for this particular trip, which was the norm, and my grandpa brought his boat up as well.  I had never been allowed to go out on the boat when we were camping, until this particular trip.  I guess my constant bugging finally got to him.  So he took myself and my two cousins out for a morning on Lake Restoule.  In the couple hours we were out, we must have landed 60 sunfish and rock bass, it was absolutely amazing.  We have pictures kicking around somewhere of that day, and my smile was past ear to ear.  Then, on our way back, he took us to a river that starts out of Restoule.  There was this gorgeous waterfall that seemed to be 100 feet high to me then (although now I know it wasn't).  We casted our worms and bobbers in for about an hour, then I hooked into my first ever pickerel.  It was only about 11"", but the excitement of catching a ""real fish"" was enough to hook me for life.  After this trip, my grandpa took me fishing with him every weekend, and north every summer.  I will never forget this.  We had many great outings, and he shared many of his secret holes with me which unfortunately now are either dried up or don't hold much for fish due to overfishing.  When I was a pre teen, my grandfather was diagnosed with altzheimers and we were not able to go fishing much anymore.  At this time though, my mother and I had relocated to Waterford, Ontario so I had some fantastic fishing right on my doorstep.  Sadly though, I didn't get to share many of these fantastic fishing times with him, although he was in my thoughts every time I was out on the water. He deteriorated pretty fast in the end, and finally succomed to 9 strokes in 7 days on August 15, 1995.  In recollection, this was about the time I stopped fishing.  At the time, I attributed it to getting older, girls, partying, and college.  Thinking of it now though, older and wiser I guess, I think part of me died when my grandfather passed.  The past few years have brought a flood of memories back for me of these days.  I am married now, have 2 kids of my own, and many members of my married family have a passion for the outdoors as well.  We go north every summer near timmins for pike and pickerel.  I went for the first time about 6 years ago, and the bug has slowly come back every year since.  Early this spring, I realised how important those times with my grandpa were on the water, and I started to look at my own children.  My boy doesn't show much interest at all in fishing, but he does come north with us guys most summers just to be in the boat, and my little girl always wants to do whatever daddy is doing.  She has come out with me many times on the Grand or in waterford this summer, and although the results haven't been fantastic she is always very loose lipped the whole way home, and cannot wait to go again.  Hopefully in 26 years, when she hits 30, she will remember these times as fondly as I do.  So, anyone else got their start to share?"

396641,bigugli,2009-10-27 02:27:00,6138,"Born into it in our family.  Fishing is a way of life, not just recreation.  Apparently I've caught fish since I was 2. Did the same with my kids. The son won one of the big prizes at the St kitts Catfish Derby at 3. Spending a good chunk of my childhood in the ""Skokers"" had its benefits. First thing in the morning checking the trot line for a pike, then check the bait traps. Bobber fish til breakfast was ready. When we moved to Toronto (YECHHHHH!), skipped a lot of school on Fridays to head up to the uncle's for another weekend on 6 Mile. Gram and Aunt Lily were as proficient as the men with a rod and reel, as is my Mother, and now, my daughter. As Finns we feast on fish, hence the need to be fishing all the time. Fried, baked, stuffed, pickled. Pike was mainly for ""fish head soup"". Only my Gram and aunt would clean the fish. Apparently us men wasted too much flesh.   Had a clothes line strung up where we hung gar skulls to dry over the summer months."

396648,johnnyb,2009-10-27 02:44:00,3413,"Great topic, Raptorfan  I remember my first fish, maybe age 4? 5? OFf the dock at my Dad's parent's place on Lake Muskoka.  I remember the loud click of the massive brown Zebco spinning reel....I remember my dad saying ""reel reel reel reel!""  And out came a sunfish, and everyone made a big deal of it.  Soon I was (reluctantly) lipping my first rock bass....but the trips to that cottage ended, as Papa died, and Nana had to sell the cottage.  Nobody in the family was able to keep it, so, we spent the next few years roaming the provincial parks in rv's and pop up trailers.  It wasn't until we got a cottage on 3 mile lake (the one near Utterson) that I clearly remember the fishing bug becoming permanent.  As soon as someone said ""hey, you don't have to sit around here...you can go down to the lake and fish""...that was it.  I never understood why my older siblings would complain that there was nothing to do up there....we had a lake!! We could fish!!! Every Friday night, we'd stop at Ellwood Epps...grab some worms....and all weekend, I would work my shoreline spots for countless panfish.  Then we got the little tinner...and I could work more shoreline!  And troll!!!  Still remember sitting in a car-repair shop in Huntsville for the afternoon, and my Dad and I walked next door to a convenience store to kill time...he bought me a copy of Field and Stream.  I read the thing repeatedly...being about 9 or 10 by now....and dove headlong into a host of new techniques...which had me saving money to buy lures...which I still do now Ahhh....good, good memories"

396673,holdfast,2009-10-27 03:36:00,1813,"My old man did, inadvertently I would say.  I was about eight years old and we had a huge snow fall and I was bugging him about buying me a snow shovel.  I guess I pestered enough that he told me to look at the fishing stuff in the catalogue.  Anyways he inherited an old trailer on Lake Champlain VT where I would live for eight summers. That Spring he gave me a stick, hook, nut and a leaf for bait.  So I went to Peanuts dock ( Our American neighbor) and dangled that thing in front of a couple of rock bass for two days.  I guess Peanuts felt sorry for me and gave me a worm for bait which in no time, I caught my first two fish.  Yup, put them in a pail and waited for Dad to come back from work a few days later to show him.  Yupper, WHAT A SMELL. Peanuts, who was probably in his late 60s would be a person that I would always remember and be grateful to this day.  A Prince of a Man."

396676,pike slayer,2009-10-27 03:52:00,1177,"Unlike most of you i wasnt born into fishing. My buddy nate was like you guys born into fishing and always went with his father and grandfather. One friday night my buddy nate calls me and asks me if i want to go ice fishing. hes like we'll go out by searchmont and we'll go across a couple lakes and through the bush and i was jacked to go cause i just bought my first snowmobile and thats all i was thinking about, riding untouched powder and flying across a lake. Well i did exactly that and we stopped, set up lines and we hung out and we caught alot of fish. we caught probably 20lakers. he gave me my 2 holes and he had his. it was such a thrill running and pulling up fish. it turned into a competition and we had a blast! That summer Nate called me about fishing again saying that his dad and him had plan a fishing trip but his dad got called into work and wasnt gonna be able to go. Seeing is how we had such a great time ice fishing i really wanted to go out summer fishing. That evening we ran over to crappy tire, i bought a $30 rod/reel a couple lures and we were set. We camped out for 2 days at a lake had lots of beers and laughs and he showed me the ropes and we caught a pile of walleye and bass. After that trip i was offically hooked to fishing. After that just about every weekend my buddy nate and i went out. I started researching different techniques, lures, places, etc. and i was into fishing more then my buddy nate. but my buddy always had an open mind and full of adventure. We tried sooo many new lakes, tried every lure in the book and we were really honing in our skills. I have slowly become nates guide haha!! i truely thank him for showing me the first few set of ropes!"
396677,cowanjo,2009-10-27 03:55:00,249,I would like to say I caught the fishing bug from my dad - i can remember catching fish for dinner whiting (Salt water fish white fillet) - i remember shoving the bait in some fish mouth he caught on the bank - not sure the minnows (mullet) liked it or he did either.  i spend days now trying to make my son interested but fishing in canada is too easy - he sits on the dock and catches fish after fish. maybe he has the expertise.  This year he caught his first musky trolling for walleye wasnt big but all by himself age 7.  If anyone is really interested I spent my summers in a place called south west rocks NSW Australia - romantic name awesome fishing - i caught mullet (Bait) for people who paid me in the summer (They tried to catch a mulloway) - i will never forget the loaves of bread i bought - i used inside as bait and ate the rest.  thankyou for this topic i live in canada now miss my family in australia especially my dad who made me who i am
396721,John,2009-10-27 12:56:00,2956,"I wasn't born into it either. Dad wasn't a fishermen. His first, or second love, depending on who you ask was motorcycles and cars. My uncle, Mom's youngest brother was a fisherman and belonged to a few fishing clubs in the North of England where I grew up. He took me fishing in the rivers and streams regularly. Mostly float fishing (and you steelheaders think you invented it), and the odd fly fishing trip. We moved to a house near a pretty good 2 mile stretch of river when I was 11 and I spent almost every free moment there until girls were discovered and that spoiled everything. Another uncle, (Dad's brother), got me into sea fishing. He owned a 38' ex lifeboat that we took out to the wrecks in the North Sea in the Summer and fished off the beaches and rocks in the winter. Came to Canada when I was 21 got married, kids came soon after and didn't fish much for the first few years. Once I discovered the amazing resources that this wonderful country has, I was ""hooked"" once again and have been ever since. I guess I didn't get my kids into it early enough as they don't have a lot of interest, however my 9 year old grandson seem to have it in his blood."

396723,backbay,2009-10-27 13:07:00,773,"It was a family thing for me. Shooting, hunting and fishing were my dad's favourite pastimes. I can remember practicing my fly fishing cast in the front yard when I was about 10. My brother started tying his own flies when he was about 12, and does a lot of fly fishing for pike these days. For years I would fish once or twice a year, but got back into it with a vengeance about 5 years ago, thank goodness."
396729,Jer,2009-10-27 13:39:00,1426,"My Dad was never a fisherman, but had a passion for camping, cottaging and canoeing. We spent many summers camping around Ontario, rented a cottage on the Bonnechere for several years, and weeks at a time at my uncle's cottage on Pigeon.  The fishing just came naturally. My friends and I spent a lot of time down at the Credit river as well, (this was before Erindale park was really developed) catching chub, small bass and the odd trout.  Everywhere we went I just always wanted a fishing rod in my hand.  In my mid-twenties, I had the opportunity to move to the Peterborough area, bought my modest house on the lake when they were still affordable and hope to be here til the day I die."
