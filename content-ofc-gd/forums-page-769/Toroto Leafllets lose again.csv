398524,F7Firecat,2009-11-02 02:45:00,347,What is it  42 years of rebuilding or so.....................LOL
398529,Twocoda,2009-11-02 03:03:00,4130,It truely pains me to say this but ....the laughs did play a heck of a game last night ...sure they lost ...but they didnt lean back on the blades at all ...and if it wasnt for the fluky banked goal scored against them ...they possibly might have won....the game kept me awake and on the edge of the seat .....thats alot more then i could say for my flames
398552,PikeMolester,2009-11-02 06:46:00,428,Ole ole ole ole!
398562,Billy Bob,2009-11-02 12:23:00,5865, These things take time......just look at the Buffalo Bums....errr...Bills.....it's been 10 years since they have played in the post season.
398565,blaque,2009-11-02 12:43:00,2419,"I posted this directly after the game friday night in another thread, only BillM recognized the compliment  ""So what happened to your guys team? DIdnt look like the leafs everyone always rips on to me? lol  They put the heat on my sabres for sure in the third.  Miller stole the game from you guys.  But hey, ya gotta admit your leafs worked it tonite  Go Sabres ""  Sabres let their guard down to the wrong team.......unfortunately, they let it down even more severely the following night with a 5-0 loss to the Islanders and a Ryan Miller Yankin"
398622,Governator,2009-11-02 15:17:00,879,"Well I was pretty bitter to see Toskala in net on sat against montreal, but I think the reason behind it is that if the monster played 3/4 nights he wouldn't be playing at the home game in Toronto on Tuesday where they haven't won a game yet.  Also, it really bugs me when people make remarks like ""I'm not a fan of the leafs anymore because they suck"".  That's horrible and those who say that aren't real fans.  I hate people who just jump on the bandwagon when a team is winning."
398648,blaque,2009-11-02 16:51:00,2419," People get ticked, i think at some point..........ya just get fed up with it and investing all that time and money into a junk product. At some point ya gotta throw your hands up. I know im a die hard Bills fan........but i find myself finding better things to do with my sundays than watch a team that refuses to try and get better. Theres a difference between being a bandwagoner and being a die hard that is so passionate about it that they get so frustrated and furious , that they make  comments like ""im not a fan anymore"" Sounds like thats the issue up there, is that theres too many that suport ticket sales that just dont care if they are winning, they just want to take the clients to the games. You need MORE people saying, this team stinks and i refuse to pay for a ticket anymore. You need more people throwing their hands up and saying this is enough. Im stepping down from being a leafs fan. I wouldnt calll that bandwagon. Id call it fed up and not going to take it anymore. And i can relate with my football team who ive invested many sundays of my time and many dollars, and countless emotions on over the years and an owner who refuses to recognize that something needs to change"

398800,F7Firecat,2009-11-02 23:18:00,347,"  TIME.......TIME.... TIME ....... how about a life time, I am 37 years old and what have the leafs done in my lifetime,  JACK SQUAT!  LEAFS SUCK!"
398094,Billy Bob,2009-10-31 13:46:00,5865,"I don't want to start anything, OK maybe I do. I see the Leafs lost again and this time to my Buffalo Sabres......NOT GOOD.....BTW are you guys still interested in buying the Bills because no one here wants them anymore......."
398110,jediangler,2009-10-31 14:34:00,1923,I hear the Bills may be going to L.A. to play in that brand new stadium   .
398112,timmeh,2009-10-31 14:43:00,609,"You know if the Bills could just put together a respectable offensive line next year they may surprise you. They've got some decent, young skill players and their defense isn't that bad. But their O-line is just a sieve.  And I think that opening game loss really hurt them. If they could have held on that would have given them a ton of confidence and who knows...but this season is probably lost.   As for the leafs...they're still a joke, but as long as leafs nations still believes (for reasons I can't understand) in what they're doing they will still continue to ice bush league teams."
398114,[emailÂ protected],2009-10-31 14:48:00,290,I switched my allegiance to the Hamilton Coyotes.
398116,BillM,2009-10-31 14:59:00,17367,"  BB, did you watch the game?  Miller stood on his head, the rest of the Sabres didn't help him much...  He also needs to thank the iron behind him.  I think the Leafs hit 3-4 posts lastnight?  Sometimes the bounces just don't go your way, lol.  And we still don't want the Bills!"
398118,lunkerbasshunter,2009-10-31 15:02:00,2585,yeah the leafs actually have played well the last few games.  Not saying that they are great or anything but they outplayed a buffalo team that  is one of the top teams in the league so far.  The monster will keep us competitive this year but sadly no playoffs this year  cheers!
398122,BillM,2009-10-31 15:17:00,17367," Yup, playoffs are a wet dream I'm sure.  If things keep going the way they are, the next couple of years will be extremely interesting."
398125,Guest gbfisher,2009-10-31 15:24:00,0,the Leafs lost again  and you expected something different?.....
398144,charlied,2009-10-31 17:01:00,584,I wouldn't say Buffalo doesn't want them.....they sell out or almost sell out every home game!  Thats far from wanting the team there.  I go to Buffalo all the time and people are wearing Bills clothes everywhere.  On that note  GO BRONCOS GO!!!!
398154,Rizzo,2009-10-31 18:09:00,4754,I'm a major leafs pessimist...but they have looked decent the last few games. Was really impressed with the short-handed goal in the last minute last night to tie the game...made losing in ot tolerable
398159,bassmaster4,2009-10-31 18:24:00,801,some fans you are...
398162,Radnine,2009-10-31 18:43:00,1538," I agree, they have looked much better as of late. Buffalo looked completely awful last night which is a bummer because I have watched a couple of their games this year and they have looked like they were flying out there. I was looking forward to them skating circles around the Leafs and it didn't happen. The Leafs are starting to look like that team that will finish tenth or eleventh again. Brian Burke just looks dumb. I will also say again that I felt like I was watching Leafs TV instead of a stand-alone network. Joe Bowen knows what side his bread is buttered on for sure. Evertime the Leafs carry it across the blue line without going offside warrants a ""holy mackinaw!!"" from Joe. Jim"
398173,grt1,2009-10-31 19:51:00,638,I got an email the other day from a guy who said Hamilton is still without an NHL team and they were only 1 game behind the LEAFS
398186,Bernie,2009-10-31 20:38:00,3190,"Bulletin  Toronto Hydro is warning customers of the rotating winter power blackouts that are expected to occur on:   November 2009 Tue, 3 Nov 2009 Sat, 7 Nov 2009 Tue, 10 Nov 2009 Sat, 14 Nov 2009 Sat, 21 Nov 2009 Mon, 23 Nov 2009 Mon, 30 Nov 2009  December 2009 Mon, 7 Dec 2009 Wed, 9 Dec 2009 Sat, 12 Dec 2009 Mon, 14 Dec 2009 Wed, 16 Dec 2009 Sat, 19 Dec 2009 Mon, 21 Dec 2009 Sat, 26 Dec 2009  2010 information to Follow   This is a province wide alert. The lack of power seems to consistently occur just after 7 pm on Saturday or 7:30 pm weekdays and is attributed to the excessive power required to run the goal judge's light, behind the Leafs' net. Sincerely Yours, Toronto Hydro   GO LEAFS! - SOMEWHERE!"
398188,JohnF,2009-10-31 20:50:00,3494, D'ya suppose it's just a coincidence that Hamilton is now talking about a new sports facilty to replace Ivor Wynne? I couldn't tell if it included a hockey arena at the requisiite level to accommodate an NHL team. Hard to believe they'd do it just for a Canadian football team.  My apologies to Solo and the other 2 TiCat fans.  JF
398252,siwash,2009-11-01 02:36:00,683,"the Leafs have outplayed every team over the past 5 games.  They have had few breaks and a bunch of really bad calls against them  They are better than than their record indicates.   Check back in April. I am certain things will turn around   As for Mtl, they will NOT make the playoffs... they were thoroughly outplayed by the Leafs again (second time this seaon)  They are small and basically a one line team (and a marginal line at best)   The future is bright... good prospects and excellent yooung goalie and a very committed management team  Cup contenders within 3 years"

398327,Billy Bob,2009-11-01 15:07:00,5865, You have to live here and not just drive through to get a feel how the fans feel about this BORING team....they all hate the coach on now the owner for not firing the coach.........the offensive line will get better but we still don't have a QB.....Edwards is afraid to throw the ball down field......the fans hate him too......listen to our radio sport station here WGR550 it can be heard online at this link......http://www.wgr550.com/pages/3306947.php  The best thing that can happen to the Buffalo area is the Bills leave.
398328,F7Firecat,2009-11-01 15:11:00,347," Cup contender in 3 years LOL  Ya like thats gonna happen, first they have to make the playoffs, howm any years has that been.........  Keep the faith loyal Leaf Fans, sell out the ACC all season. Your just gonna get what you have always got and that is a half rate NHL team if you keep supporting the leaves. MLSE dont care about winning, its all about the $$$$$$$$$$ and Leaf fans are the sugar daddy."
398333,ch312,2009-11-01 15:26:00,1590,  if the above were true....shouldnt they be winning?  the leafs suck plain and simple.
398335,BillM,2009-11-01 15:50:00,17367, Have you watched the last two games they've played?  Down by 2 against Montreal only to come back and tie it with like 2 mins left?  Similar to what they did against the Sabres?  I forgot you can't play a great game and still only come away with 1 point..
398351,ch312,2009-11-01 17:20:00,1590," if they were a good team they'd be winning. its funny when you hear people saying ""did you see how good they played"" or ""they managed to tie it up"" or even ""the leafs played a great game last night"". what these fans fail to realize is that a good game for toronto still isnt good enough to beat other teams. unfortunately for the current worst team in the league, close only counts in horse shoes  the leafs sure are lucky they have such loyal fans who stick behind a team that will never make it to the finals and likely has the highest ticket price in the league...."

You realize this is a rebuilding stage right?  I don't think anyone is expecting them to come out and win the Stanley Cup..  A good game was them coming back from a 2 goal deficit to tie it and go into OT..  What do you call that?  crap hockey?  Perhaps you don't have any hockey sense at all, but it's pretty easy for me to realize what is and what isn't good hockey."
398443,Radnine,2009-11-02 00:12:00,1538," Bill, your kidding right? How many rebuilding years have we been through? I think even the Leafs don't use that term anymore because they have worn it out. Steelheaders, sheesh"
