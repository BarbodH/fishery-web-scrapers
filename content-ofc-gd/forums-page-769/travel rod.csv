399009,super dave,2009-11-03 17:08:00,323,Anyone know where i can get a travel rod for a decent price in the GTA?  I know BPS has some.  Just looking for some other options.  Thanks.

Snag is a huge proponent on them and says they're the bees knees for snot rockets!!  Call ahead to avoid any surprises...  If you're planning on chasing baby tarpon and bones, you might wanna look into something with a bit more pep.  St-Croix makes a 3 piece Premier that would be ideal, and it comes with a pvc case.  I bought one as a back-up for my trip to Cayo Coco last Febuary and it was perfect for small tarpon and cudas!!  Good luck.  HD"

Shakespear telescopic, 6'6, M, Spinning = $10-20 3. Gander Mountain 6'6, M, 4 piece, spinning= $20  I recommend the Browning I bought the other 2 in the States  I have bought and broken the telescopic CT rods. Don't bother. Yes, they sell shakespears but the ones I have from the U.S are better/stronger I also don't recommend the 4 piece Quantums at Lebarons.  I'm sure you can find some strong telescopics around here. Consider the telescopic Carp rods too.  The main thing about the telescopics is that the tips will break more when they are collapsed and in transit!  Buy some extra tips!  Good luck!"
