398913,ohhenrygsr,2009-11-03 04:20:00,947,I would just get the Quantum Hot Sauce or even the Ardent complete reel cleaner.  They are designed for reels

398929,Dabluz,2009-11-03 05:10:00,701,"Hot Sauce is too thin for spinning reels.  They do not have any fast moving parts anyway.  Lithium grease is perfect for the gears if the grease is consistent enough.  Ordinary sewing machine oil is perfect for the line guide and the handle.  Most spinning reels never need to be greased anyway.  I have a Shimano Symetre 2000 that I bought over 10 years ago and it is so smooth that if I place the handle at horizontal and unlock the anti-reverse, the reel will slowly spin (either way) until the handle is down in the vertical position.  I use this reel everytime I go fishing and I go fishing at least 3 times per week all year round.  I use this reel for ice fishing too."
