399077,justinsalmon,2009-11-03 19:54:00,5,no plans tomorrow so heading downtown to spend the day fishing. Just wondering what to use for bass/pike/ trout at this time of year? thanks

Trout is extremely rare to catch in the thames, but they are in there (ask jjcanoe)  If you find deep pools try casting crankbaits that are noisey...its really shallow though...had my boat in there on the weekend and it was 2-3ft on average depth"
