396960,Matt15,2009-10-28 03:05:00,107,"This fall I decided to strictly target musky. I'm pretty new to musky fishing and have only caught a few in the last few years. I think that my patience and determination has really started to pay off this fall. The first musky was caught in the middle of September on a 8"" walleye believer (casting). the second fish was caught just before thanksgiving on a super shad rap, perch colour (trolling). The third fish was caught this past Sunday on a 8"" walleye believer (trolling). after the last few outings i don't want to fish for anything else but musky, and maybe the occasional pike.        "

397141,musky66,2009-10-28 21:24:00,273,Musky fishing is like that- I got bit by it in 2000 and haven't looked back since. I do well in the Kawarthas and finally managed a big girl in G Bay a few years back. Love 'em!
