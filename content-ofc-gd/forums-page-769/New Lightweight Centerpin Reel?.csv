I would LOVE to switch to a more LIGHTWEIGHT pin - Anyways, while searching on the internet I came across this reel called ""HBE Singularis 130 5""OD Carbon Fiber Centerpin""... My question(s) is/are this/these...  1) Does anyone know if this reel would be made available anytime in stores? (The only info I can find is off a website I often frequent, but not have yet joined their forums)  2) Does anyone know if any lightweight reels you would HIGHLY RECOMMEND to other pinners? (aside from above mentioned)  Thanks Folks, A2F  Incase you are curious as to what this pin looks like - here are a few links...  http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_hFbuukmLkmE/SsyS...PA050003(2).JPG http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_hFbuukmLkmE/SsyX...lerie_06_xl.jpg http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_hFbuukmLkmE/SsyY...-h/DSC_4500.jpg"
398582,getnjiggywithit,2009-11-02 13:20:00,18,Nice looking reel! I bet it's light!  The foot looks interesting does it swivel?  I saw a pin a while back where the whole reel swiveled 90 degrees and the reel could be casted like a spinning reel and then swiveled back to work like a regular center pin!
398585,solopaddler,2009-11-02 13:22:00,8605,"The carbon reels are new. Personally I wouldn't take the chance on them yet. There's a couple of incredibly light reels on the market that I can reccomend however. Bob James light, and the Raven Vectra SST-3. Between the 2 I'd probably lean towards the Raven. It's a bit cheaper and is incredibly light..6.7oz.  You can see both of them here:  http://centerpinangling.com/centerpinreels.html"
398592,River Rat,2009-11-02 13:38:00,161,"No the foot doesn't swivel. They are made in Swedan but the rep is local in the GTA. There is no risk involved due to the reels being new but they are very differnt from what you have gotten used to. I have had both versions in my hands and it's not for me.  There are plenty of reels out there, too many to suggest what is best for you. I bought a vectra years ago for being light but the quality was not good IMO..sems they have gotten better sinece then.....take your time and research, try some out at the shops or with buddies.  Cheers  RR"
398607,craigdritchie,2009-11-02 14:43:00,1586,"Just watch you don't go too light on the reel. I recently played with a prototype carbon reel that was hanging on an 11-1/2 foot IMX, and it made the rod feel awfully tip-heavy. Unless you fish exclusively with 9-foot rods, you need some weight in the reel to balance the stick."
398887,canadian_copper,2009-11-03 02:41:00,925,I ALWAYS GET A CHUCKLE OUT OF THIS. WERE TALKIN OUNCES HERE LOL UNLESS YA HAVE A MEDICAL CONDITION I DONT THINK ITS REALLY GONNA MAKE A DIFF. BUT LIKE THE OTHERS SAID THE RAVEN AND BOB JAMES ARE GOOD REELS. ONLY THING ID BE WEARY OF IS LIGHTER WEIGHT USUALLY MEANS WEAKER METAL. NOT GONNA NAME THE REEL BUT WHEN IT FIRST CAME OUT I BENT IT WITH SQUEEZING IT IN MY HAND.JUST BE CAUTIOUS ON WHAT YA GET. LIKE I SAID WERE ONLY TALKIN OUNCES HERE.
398893,kemper,2009-11-03 03:01:00,2232,"A super lightweight reel isnt really necessary, that said I own a Raven Vectra SST3 and I love it to death. I am careful with it because I have heard you can bend em...but I havent had any such problems. Just last week it took down a 40"" chinny on the credit without any bending issues."

398908,kemper,2009-11-03 03:52:00,2232,  she was fresh!  How was NY dude?
398944,dave524,2009-11-03 11:24:00,4508,"Depending on how you hold and operate your rod and reel, the fact that there is really no backplate and the spool appears to sit quite a distance from the reel seat may not work for you."
