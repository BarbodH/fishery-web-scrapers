398521,Matt15,2009-11-02 02:41:00,107,This summer I bought an old Penn Peer 209 reel at a garage sale for ten bucks. It looked like it was in decent condition. I thought it would be an alright trolling reel for musky for now and then probably be a backup. I'm wondering if anyone has this reel and can tell me if its normal for the line not to come out very easy when you in gage the spool. the line doesn't come out by itself wen the lure is in the water. I had to like pull the line out with my hand. Is there any way to fix this problem? Does the reel maybe have to be oiled and greased? I know the reel didn't cost me much but i thought it would be a nice little project for me to fix. Any tips or suggestions will be greatly appreciated. Thanks
