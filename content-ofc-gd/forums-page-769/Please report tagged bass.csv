Without those recaps being called in the program would be nowhere ... and in the long run it will benefit all of us die hard bass anglers.  A voicemail to the MNR number from someone catching a tagged bass and reporting it - was left over the weekend. First, thanks to that person for doing so ... The only problem is that the caller left a tag number and the general location but no further details. Please guys ... for this program to be a success we need to know the following:  Date of Catch Size: (even approximate - most of you here are good estimators) Angler: One tag or two - both have unique numbers Tag numbers Tag Color Condition of fish Released or kept:  Please try and get in the habit of bringing a pen and paper with you incase you're lucky enough to catch a tagged bass - and remember if the tag is covered in algae scrape it away with a pen knife until the number magically appears!  Thanks for your help!  Wil"
