397902,bigfish1965,2009-10-30 21:20:00,3382," My quoted remark was not of distaste or disapproval, it was of astonishment. I know this are of the province is supposed to have an extreme population of coyotes now, so seeing a visual like that is something that puts it into perspective. My recollection from SSFC is that coyote population control is pretty much an excercise in futility since they will always breed to food supply. Moles, voles, field mice and rabbits are in good supply with the last two wet winters. Coyotes (in this area anyway) are actually helpful since we have little other predators, but their increase in numbers is concerning."
397925,siwash,2009-10-30 22:45:00,683,"  There are a lot.. and I'm ok with controlling pop. But I would say that without our control measures, they would cull themselves... by starving themselves one they eat all the prey... it does happen in remote areas where predator/prey relationships are dependent on one anther..  i suppose that we don[t have that much time...  anyhow the posters are entitled to their opinions... I try to take a balanced approach recognizing that people in certain parts of the province, especially farming communities aren't fond of yotes..."

398812,ch312,2009-11-02 23:40:00,1590, when the coyotes eat all they can in an area they start feeding on livestock. its simply to costly for many farmers to coyote proof (they will dig under fences) their properties so the coyotes would just have a hay day on live stock. its also been documented that small game populations will sometimes increase after coyotes move in the area. they pretty much just make up for the loss to coyotes. makes sense i guess.  and no this is not a huge waste of fur. the hides have likely been stretched and dried out already and put in storage for the winter and this was a pic they staged before taking the fur to auction. that is a LOT of money sitting right there and he put in a lot of time to get those animals so i doubt he'd waste em. last i checked the average coyote hide was going for $25-$30 at the toronto fur auction.   anyone wanna take a count to see how many he has up there?
397270,Skud,2009-10-29 01:23:00,739,A lot of good Fur Stoles going to waste. 
397289,Spiel,2009-10-29 01:56:00,9065,I'd say that's excessive. The guy probably has a testosterone deficiency!
397321,muskymike,2009-10-29 02:59:00,772,slightly excessive no?  disgusting actually.
397324,oxcowboy,2009-10-29 03:03:00,544,i can think of a couple more that should be on the ol barn!  jason
397327,barracuda,2009-10-29 03:08:00,41,Maybe he needed insulation for his barn?
397446,bucktail,2009-10-29 14:51:00,1857,Yah that's just disturbing. Who has that much free friggin time?
397450,bigfish1965,2009-10-29 15:00:00,3382,How can that be real? The population density would have to be beyond belief for that many kills.
397451,hotrod,2009-10-29 15:03:00,103,
397455,bigfish1965,2009-10-29 15:23:00,3382, Yeah we saw that yesterday. We were commenting on the hundreds of hides on that barn (not the need to kill those coyotes responsible for killing that girl). I call shenanigans on the pic.
397456,capt bruce,2009-10-29 15:26:00,820,"Dont know about that Rick , theres no limit ,no season in some states you just sign up and shoot away , his living room is lined with baby seals.Whats the bet HE DONT belong to P3TA  http://www.state.sd.us/applications/gf77vo...ntersIntro.aspx"
397459,bigfish1965,2009-10-29 15:33:00,3382,All I am saying is that the population density would have to be phenomenal. Take your average hunt here and the success rate and then figure out how many times greater it would have to be in order to have a barn covered in them. Don't know how long they would last out there like that so don't know how many years that could have taken.
397463,capt bruce,2009-10-29 15:38:00,820,Ric they even have tournaments wouldnt take too long to fill up the barn with these numbers  http://www.coyotehunter.net/forums/viewtop...=a&start=45

397541,cityfisher,2009-10-29 20:46:00,959,can you imagine owning a dog and leaving it out int he yard before that guy got started? or letting your young kids out to play....in some areas they are GROSSELY over populated...
397545,Dara,2009-10-29 20:56:00,3052,  holy crap..they have a forum for everything
397565,outllaw,2009-10-29 22:48:00,1232,nuttin wrong with burning a few coyotes. have at em boys. windsors full.. a few stray cat pelts wouldnt hurt either.

Bob (the nut case in NY)"
397693,dave524,2009-10-30 02:14:00,4508,"Used to hunt yotes in the late 70's with a crew and sent them to the fur auction in North Bay. They were worth about $50 a piece back then and I was making about $8-9 an hour, which was decent money at the time. Even with the lower fur prices of today looks like a good paycheck there.  Edit: if you have ever cased out a yote I don't think they are being wasted."

397778,NAC,2009-10-30 13:36:00,369,someone should introduce the hunter to cormorants.
397836,ch312,2009-10-30 17:12:00,1590,"lol...some of the comments from the ignorant are quite amusing yet sad at the same time...   ""testosterone deficiency"" ""disgusting"" ""who has that much free time"" ""how can that be real"" ""holy crap..they have a forum for everything""   some places have far too many coyotes and with practically no natural predators we need hunters and trappers to keep the populations in check. if it werent for these men and women killing thousands of coyotes every year there would be much less wildlife in the bush and a lot more livestock being lost. it is nearly impossible to get rid of all coyotes in an area which is why there are no seasons or bag limits in most areas."
