I know the Benelli is a fine gun, and the one I am thinking of getting would be brand new. But an opportunity to purchase a Beretta has come along and I am thinking that a semi-auto would be a smart choice, even if it used. Plus, it's a Beretta. Can't go wrong. The other bonus is that it is cheaper since it's used - $700 (tax incl) vs $450  I tried doing a google search on the 301. I didn't find a lot of reviews, per say.  Any thoughts/opinions?  Thanks!"
