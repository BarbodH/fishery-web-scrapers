I have a spot in mind on the lake (20' to 30' drop off) so my intent was to cast to cover more water rather then troll.  Now, I was wondering how deep can I get these lures casting, waiting then reeling in?  Are the walleye still going shallow later in the day to feed?  I haven't been there in a few weeks...  I'll be hunting walleye and if lucky musky, thanks.  Geoff"
