The big fish, which was later released back into Lake St. Clair, tipped the scales at 48.5 pounds.  The musky was caught by Tony Jaros of St. Clair Shores.  Jim Fleming of Wyoming, a fishing charter captain and director of the Michigan-Ontario Muskie Club, was in charge of the weigh-in at Cove Marina.  ""It was a monster,'' he said. ""It set an all-time record for the lake.''  Fleming said several giant muskie have been boated in the past week, weighed and released.    Cheers  Craig"
