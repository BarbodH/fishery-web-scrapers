398579,solopaddler,2009-11-02 13:14:00,8605,"I normally shy away from the popular streams on a weekend but Sunday was just too tempting. A big slug of rain had spiked the water flow up north. Looking at the Environment Canada flow rate graphs, the rivers shot straight up on Sat. With no rain overnight and knowing these rivers clear and drop on a dime I knew Sun would be good. Arriving in town well before sunup we grabbed a coffee and proceeded to check a variety of popular access points. Many anglers had had the same idea as huge numbers of cars were everywhere. A little disheartening but not entirely unexpected. Fortunately almost 30 years of fishing this particular river has provided options. We drove further up stream to another access and found some solitude and fish. The morning was crazy, we put a large number of fish on the bank, all bright chrome and full of fight. Twice I had fish hit so hard my float was ripped 3' sideways across current, pulling my rod arm forward in the process. Just wild! Fish were caught on a mix of white and chartreuse roe bags to start with. Once the water dropped and cleared by mid-day and more anglers arrived on the scene the fishing slowed considerably. We scratched out a few more fish by scaling down tippet and hook size and switching up to both live and pink worms. That's a great tip actually: If you know there are fish in front of you but they're not hitting, change things up. Even if that's simply matter of tweaking your rigging, do something.  I don't have a ton of pic's, but did manage to snap a few:         The glory hole.     My buddy walking a fish downstream in the afternoon with 2 frustrated anglers in the background.       Now is the literally the best time of year if you're looking to get out, I anticipate the first couple weeks of Nov all year long.  If anyone's interested the new reel is amazing. Startup is unreal and for a larger reel (it's 47/8"") it's only 8oz in weight. Very, very, very impressed!   Cheers,  Mike"

398641,DRIFTER_016,2009-11-02 16:21:00,10439,  You have one of those every Thursday!!!!
398644,dobee,2009-11-02 16:30:00,301,as always i love your reports.. makes me seriously jealous everytime!
398649,solopaddler,2009-11-02 16:56:00,8605," Jay it's a Riverkeeper, model is the ""Frogwater"". The builder is an Ontario guy, lives near Tavistock. He made a run of 20 I believe with another due to start early this winter. Somewhat similar to the Mykiss but lighter and the clicker mechanism is unlike anything I've ever seen.    Not true!!!!!! Unless I'm dragging my 2 wee ones along with me. (If I fish on Thurs or Fri I have to pay for daycare)"
398652,trapshooter,2009-11-02 17:03:00,1234,"Good show Mike.  Some beautiful fresh chrome there, for sure."
398658,highdrifter,2009-11-02 17:15:00,2534,"I see ya got your new toy..  She looks great on that Rainshadow!!  Tried the new Lamiglas this weekend..

398667,solopaddler,2009-11-02 17:48:00,8605,"  Right on bud, glad to hear you got out with the new stick!"
398668,BillM,2009-11-02 17:51:00,17367,"I think I might look into one of those fancy reels.  I need something light  Mike, the green matches your eyes!"
398701,elusive,2009-11-02 19:48:00,77,  Thats so true. Nice fish and nice pics bro.      - Vick
398706,super dave,2009-11-02 19:58:00,323,Another new reel?  You are such a gear junkie!  I'm just jealous.

398818,aniceguy,2009-11-02 23:54:00,1094,"hay who's that good lookin guy walkin down river, wonder why those guys were frustrated...looks like someone was having a moment"
398826,steelhead hunter,2009-11-03 00:29:00,152,hit that same spot thurs afternoon and fri morning gin clear and  nothing except some old boots what a day or 2 can do around there  at least some one got some crome there
398827,Musky or Specks,2009-11-03 00:31:00,2710,I use to miss so many classes at Guelph when I would get the call from a landowner up there that the river would be on the next day. It can produce absolutely stupid amounts of fish. Nice to see you could get into them.
398829,msp,2009-11-03 00:34:00,1336,LOL......That just doesn't sound right?
398833,BillM,2009-11-03 00:40:00,17367, It wasn't supposed to!!
