Got out there around 10:30 and started in one spot and about 5 minutes in, Raptorfan went for a swim...  I had a good laugh but Karma came back to me as I went head over heels over a log and almost down a steep embankment.. good times.. lol.  We saw 2 in the water, one was fighting his way upstream through a shallow stream trib and the other was just hanging out.  We drifted a couple different baits in front of him but he looked in very rough shape and he spooked and took off.  Raptorfan did catch a tiny rainbow smaller than the hook he was using, beautiful coloring on these guys.   All and all, it was a learning experience and we need to read up on proper techniques as what we were doing didnt seem to work  Creek fishing is alot of work. Walking through bush and trying to maintain balance in the fast rapids.  Time to do some reading...."
