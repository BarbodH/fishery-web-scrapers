398746,Jet,2009-11-02 21:21:00,364,Mine feels small now compared some some of those Lunkers! Great job guys.    
398817,steverowbotham,2009-11-02 23:54:00,1800,"I honestly did not have a great year for BIG fish.  I caught a lot of good fish, but nothing mind boggling  There's still a month left on Simcoe, I'll get my Will Smith (7 lbs) for the year  "
398834,Cudz,2009-11-03 00:41:00,2652,I am hoping to get a 7 this fall as well.  Managed to just nose 7 last fall and judging by the length of my moustach it was well into Nov. when I caught her.  Still time.
398905,rickster,2009-11-03 03:38:00,495,no giants this year but lots of decent fish

399111,jimmer,2009-11-03 21:22:00,2730,A great year for bass fishing in my books. These are a couple from the kawarthas. Largemouth at 6.4 and the smallie at 4.11.
398359,MCTFisher9120,2009-11-01 18:38:00,3761,"Hello All!  This year for myself and some friends has been fantastic for catching big large and small mouths! Share your PB bass this year with us, bring back some smiles and memories.  I know for myself every time I look at my biggin I grow a giant smile across my face. What have you learned this year that has helped you improve your bass fishing, new techniques etc, and what are you looking forward to next year?  For me, spinnerbaits and jigs will be my new techniques to try next year. Tubes, poppers, and topwater frogs have been my ""go to"" baits this last summer. And I know for some, there is still some bass fishing left to go.  Just wanted to see some of this summers big bass that Ontario has shown us! Thanks, MTBF"
398362,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-11-01 18:47:00,0,No weight but she was nearly 22.5 inches...

This thing was huge and put up a helluva fight!!!... it took me like 20 minutes to get it to the net!!!... the pic doesn't do it justice, not at all!!!  btw.. it isn't a Black Bass, but it is a ""true Bass""... those Black Bass are actually Sunfish!!!   P.S. I guess we can expect you to recap your 2009 year into 2015 if you don't do any better Mike?"
398454,Dutchy,2009-11-02 00:32:00,416,"largest I caught, bear in mind I am 6 foot 3 "
398457,Greencoachdog,2009-11-02 00:36:00,8163,"  Yeah!... I'm 7'-2"" and can hide a Basketball in my hands!!!"
398464,BillM,2009-11-02 00:45:00,17367,"I honestly don't think I've caught a bass this year.  With an insane work schedule in the summer, one fly in trip, another trip up to Nipigon, then steelhead season there hasn't been much time for bass.  :EDIT: I caught some big ones while up at the camp with Mike, but those were OOS so they don't count."
398472,irishfield,2009-11-02 01:00:00,26272, Sure they do and I bet there's even pictures!!
398474,Greencoachdog,2009-11-02 01:03:00,8163,   what kind of avid fisherman would take pics of an OOS fish???
398475,jediangler,2009-11-02 01:06:00,1923,"This is the biggest I caught this year. No PB but not bad for the Grand river. It was 19.5"" and hit a jig. "
398481,Fishing 24/7,2009-11-02 01:21:00,709,  5.7 lbs  and my first on the flip/pitch
398483,BillM,2009-11-02 01:25:00,17367,  I think there is one pic!  I better burn it before the MNR comes knocking on my door  It's sad to think that's the only bass I tangled with this year.
398490,irishfield,2009-11-02 01:32:00,26272,Aren't they open all year at Mike's anyhow?? They are in Ontario from Liskeard North.
398491,BillM,2009-11-02 01:34:00,17367," See that's the thing, I thought they were open on the lake we were fishing, Mike told me they were still closed.  So I dunno.... regardless they all went back in the drink."
398492,fishhunter,2009-11-02 01:35:00,604,i should get credit on 50% of that one lol well maybe 25% it was your plane they were hiding under lol
398495,Greencoachdog,2009-11-02 01:42:00,8163,"   ... that's ok Lloyd, we all know Wayne can't catch decent fish unless Leah or someone else is there to help him!... it's a ""given""!!!"

398526,ehg,2009-11-02 02:50:00,2666,Nice smallmouth caught near end of summer... 
398527,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-11-02 02:56:00,0,gorgeous smallie dude.  how big was that bird?
398540,Cudz,2009-11-02 03:53:00,2652,Nothing big yet this year. Caught lots of 4+ pound bass this year but only one over 5 (so far). this was 5.3 pounds. I will be out again in the next 2 weeks so I should crush that if all goes well. 
398555,laszlo,2009-11-02 11:08:00,487,19.5 inch Smallie caught in July. I'm guessing 4lbs (up for debate)  
398586,MCTFisher9120,2009-11-02 13:23:00,3761,"Huge fish ehg! And lazo, I think that bass would weigh between 3 and 3lb 8oz.  I caught a smallie that was 22"" long and only weighed 3lb's 4oz because it was ery very skinny, yours seems to have some more girth to it.  Both great fish, You two Dr.  MTBF"
398587,LucG,2009-11-02 13:26:00,779,"This was my biggest of the year. Caught him on a drop shot. 18.5"" Smallie    And on the same day I caught my favorite bass of the year. Look at the pattern on this guy.  "
