398386,fishnpro,2009-11-01 22:38:00,93,"Hey guys, I have a lot of loose roe that I froze just under a month ago. When I took it out today the eggs are a clear yellow and it takes a lot of pressure to break one. Also they barely even smell at all. I have never had this happen to me and I have been steelheading many years now. Has anyone else ever had this problem? What can I do to soften it up a little? any info you guys can give me will help me out. thanks   -Fishnpro"
398391,BillM,2009-11-01 22:49:00,17367,You could soften them up with a soak in luke warm water...
398434,bow slayer,2009-11-02 00:05:00,1074,sounds like they were over cured in cold water. I would use them the way they are. If you want try soaking them in warm water with some salt to soften them up.
