Weather co-operated and so did the fish, i dunno what is under that one hole but wrong word, shes a hot spot forsure, cant wait to check it in spring with the depth finder. That way we can know exactly what it is we were sittin on. Good times."
299353,jwl,2009-01-30 10:22:00,1056,"that looks like some great fishing,funny how that happenes some times when one of the holes gets most of the fish."
299378,corvette1,2009-01-30 13:29:00,1765,nice looking fish congrats
