Tarpon fishing is something that I have always wanted to do and so I told my girlfriend it was time we went. Unfortunately she could only get a week off so I said why don't I head down a week early and get that nasty fishing business  out of the way first and then she could meet me down there for a tour of the country. (white water rafting on the east side, tour of the volcanos and jungle tour on horse back in the central basin, the 5 days on the Pacific beach with an island hopping trip on a catamaran. she agreed bless her wonderful heart.  I figure I will need a month or so to recoup. I am heading to Silver King Lodge which is supposed to be the best Tarpon Lodge down there. Anyone have any experience there or just Tarpon fishing in general? I am going to take some tackle musky rod down and give it a whirl. They do supply gear but just wanted to feel one on my gear.  should be fun.  OK that is enough drooling guys. I am taking the movie camera so when that huge shark takes a run at one of my Tarpon I will post it for you!"

We didnt do any tarpon fishing, but we stumbled upon a fishing village near Santa Teresa on the Nicoya Peninsula.  The fisherman will take you out for free if you let them keep the fish.  It's a commercial thing, it helps them out!"
299369,John,2009-01-30 12:59:00,2956,Have a great time Rob. Take plenty of photo's.
299371,Spiel,2009-01-30 13:03:00,9065,....Tarpon! Man I'm envious.   All I can say Rob is go and have a great time and bring us back lots of pictures.

The tackle the Charter Captain used was Medium heavy and Heavy action Spinning gear, 7 foot rods with a reel that had enough line capacity if you hooked up with a large fish.  We drifted the lagoons and mangro trees with live anchovies.  I hooked up with 5 fish and only landed 3.  The biggest fish I landed was around 25 lbs.  I did have one very large fish on, guide estimated it around 100 lbs. but I was spooled by the time the guide was able to get the boat started to retrieve some line.  Amazing how fast they can strip line.  The second fish lost was in the 50 lbs. class but was lost after an amazing jump.  I was in awe of seeing this fish clear the water that I forget the cardinal rule, bow to the king.  I would definetly target them again if ever given the opportunity.  They fight like a smallmouth on steroids.  Best of luck if you get out.  Tom"
