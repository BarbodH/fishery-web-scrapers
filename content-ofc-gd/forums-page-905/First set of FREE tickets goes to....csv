298013,xeon,2009-01-27 03:39:00,350,"Feb 13-16th 2009  Actually wait I technically won. But theres only a 50-50 chance im headed down south by the 15th anyways (weather and ride dependent), so its not worth the risk of a set of tickets going to waste. Throw them in the Auction for Tyler if its still running, or if its not give them to the next guy down."
