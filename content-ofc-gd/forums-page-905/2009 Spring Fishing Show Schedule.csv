298961,diggyj,2009-01-29 14:48:00,548,"Thanks alot TJ, just what I was waiting for, now I can narrow it down to when I want to go and how I want to see. Any exhibitor list yet?  Thanks. DIRK.....  Your lucky GBW, my wife volunteered to come with me on Valentines Day. I think she wants to keep tabs on how much money I spend. I just tell her I am doing my part to help the faltering economy."
298983,GBW,2009-01-29 15:10:00,8460,"Well Dirk, mine might be coming with me for that very same reason... I don't have a pink hat like Pete or even an OFC one for that matter.  I guess I better find my Team Rapala one..."
298989,bigugli,2009-01-29 15:15:00,6138,"Judy insists on going to the show with me every year, and enters every free draw she can find.  I just have to listen to telemarketers for the next 6 months  We have fun"
299006,tdotfisherman,2009-01-29 15:31:00,317,Wow.. great names indeed.. I gotta get myself to see a seminar by Saric..
299012,Dave Mercer,2009-01-29 15:35:00,148,"Hey Guys, I hope to see you all there on Sat and Sun. Just noticed they have me on there as doing a seminar on Monday but I will not be there on Monday. So I hope to see all the OFC'ers there on Sat and Sunday and please make sure to say hi.  Dave Mercer"
299030,Pete Maina,2009-01-29 15:56:00,213,"So I'm supposed to be there at 10 am on Sat?  Com'on GBW, you gotta be certain you get one of those pink hats dude (I can see I'm gonna have to bring extra - besides the one for Roy  ) ... you can glue a Rapala patch on.  Be great to see you all there!!!! And be good to see you Dave on Saturday ... looking forward to it!  Pete"
299032,Raf,2009-01-29 16:00:00,3495,Nice list of speakers.. not sure if I'll make it but it'd be nice to see Mr. Pink Hat and Mr. Saric speak again.  You guys need to talk Dick Pearson into coming as well - really enjoyed his talk at the Muskie Oddyssey a couple of years ago.
299052,lew,2009-01-29 16:28:00,12767,"I'll definetely be sitting in the the Pete Maina seminar on Friday, and probably be hanging around for Gord Pyser too.  Would also like to listen to Saric too but it's just too crowded there on Saturdays.  Raf, your right about Dick Pearson too, his talk at the Odyssee was excellent."
299074,GBW,2009-01-29 17:11:00,8460,"A pink hat for me Pete?  HAHA, thanks.  No need to glue anything on it.  I just said I would wear my Rapala one as it is the only fishing hat I have... Geoff"

299094,Green bastard,2009-01-29 18:23:00,2,Are all these guest speakers going to be at the bps spring show or the toronto sportsmans show?
299097,Pete Maina,2009-01-29 18:28:00,213,"Be great to see you again Lew!  (Gee Geoff, I just don't understand this resistance to pinks hats. They're cool!   )  You should have a great time if it's your first trip to the show. Be sure to say hi if around Fri. or Sat.  Pete"
299099,TJQ,2009-01-29 18:35:00,7806, Spring Fishing and Boat show... here...  http://springfishingandboatshow.com/
299100,GBW,2009-01-29 18:35:00,8460,"HAHA Pete, maybe if we tell everyone it's not pink it's the colour of Salmon (the tough fish) it won't be so bad..."
