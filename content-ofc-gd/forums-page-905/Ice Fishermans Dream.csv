299576,solopaddler,2009-01-30 23:50:00,8605,Dave (DRIFTER 016) sent me this link today and I figured I'd share it with you:  http://cgi.ebay.com/ICE-CASTLE-RV-ICE-FISH...1|39:1|240:1318  Pretty wild eh?
299593,JeffBornFishin,2009-01-31 00:29:00,260,Two questions:  what does that monstrosity weigh   and how are you supposed to tow that out on a deep snow packed lake
299594,Beats,2009-01-31 00:32:00,543,"That is beyond ridiculous. ""Will arrange for local pickup only (no shipping)."""
299603,Zebco,2009-01-31 00:58:00,123,"Go down to places like Minnesota or Wisconsin and you will find the big trailers are the norm, not that fancy but they have had trailers on the ice for years."
299610,Fisherman,2009-01-31 01:12:00,7201,"I don't think that ""hut"" would last 1 week on Simcoe unless someone stayed in it full time.  That would be a prime target for the cretins that cause havoc on Simcoe in the winter. Can't leave a hut locked or anything in it. If they can't steal it, they smash it, or run into it with an old poop truck."
