299088,Dozer,2009-01-29 18:04:00,896,"For sure thats possible!  My frog that lives in my pond ate a sparrow once, couldn't even fit the damn bird all the way down!  Peice of wing and foot were still sticking out.  Amazing photo you've got there."
299089,Dozer,2009-01-29 18:06:00,896,"Forgot to add, that pike was still hungry after having that duck in its system ( which looks like its been eaten in the last day or two ).  PIG!"
298301,steverowbotham,2009-01-27 23:57:00,1800,Pikeducken???  
298302,rbaquial,2009-01-27 23:58:00,968,LOL!! That'd be an interesting taste!

298304,Greencoachdog,2009-01-28 00:01:00,8163,Don't eat the Ducturden!!!
298305,rbaquial,2009-01-28 00:03:00,968,Wait.... Did that pike have that DUCK as a MEAL?! or... are you proposing a PIKE-DUCKEN type meal?
298306,misfish,2009-01-28 00:05:00,29133,"Thats just ducky.  Im working on a recipe right now.I,ll get back to ya on this. HAHAHAHA"
298318,walleyejigger,2009-01-28 00:31:00,876,"i've seen this happen a few times, but they were smaller ducks, ducklings actually  the food chain in action"
298320,Leecher,2009-01-28 00:41:00,7832,Unbelievable.... I've heard of gators eating ducklings before..... but never seen one That duck looks like it's full grown..... what was the length of that pike?  Thanks for sharing Steve
298328,Abberz,2009-01-28 01:01:00,140,looks more like a black bird to me
298331,Abberz,2009-01-28 01:06:00,140,never mind just saw the duck head....wow thats pretty cool
298332,Daplumma,2009-01-28 01:07:00,1961,Would be cool if it were a Cormorant
298338,misfish,2009-01-28 01:15:00,29133,"Ok I got one   Recipe that is   First ya all fillet the pike. No bones. Then you add some garlic and chives to a pan of EVO. Now place the pike in the hot pan and fry.5 minutes each side. Meat should be a nice white flaky texture. Now remove ,  smother with garlic butter. Now for the duck,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Im still working on that one.................Throw it threw the window.LOL"
298340,Abberz,2009-01-28 01:21:00,140, Boil it in the pike guts?
298369,camillj,2009-01-28 02:46:00,1988,Ya dont see that everyday .. specially durig the hardwater season ... that must be the endangered sub-glaciel-diving-non-migrating species of duck !
298372,steverowbotham,2009-01-28 02:48:00,1800," LOL. I didnt catch it, I had the pic sent to me today"
298394,Cudz,2009-01-28 03:35:00,2652,Do you think it is legit Steve?
298395,Zubris21,2009-01-28 03:37:00,563,thats a wild picture.  I would be really surprised to find that in a pike belly.
298398,steverowbotham,2009-01-28 03:39:00,1800,"Hard to say... about 8 years ago on Dalrymple I watched a fish eat a duckling off the surface in the narrows... A whole duck, I would think its a good possibility."
298399,johnnyb,2009-01-28 03:42:00,3413,"I hit a back lake for largies that has produced 3 bass with birds in their bellies....increase the size of the fish, the bird, it makes sense."
298403,GBW,2009-01-28 03:52:00,8460,"That's how you know there are hungry pike and or musky around, when the ducks go missing...  I have heard of this may times but never seen a pic as I would guess most fish to be big enough to eat a duck (no matter the size) would be full for a few days so decomp. would be worse then this.  Either way I know it is possible (like a bass getting a frog) and that's a cool pic!"
298565,fishinfool,2009-01-28 17:15:00,366,"We have a cottage on Balsam Lake and every year my sister gets all mushy about feeding the ducks that have had babies. There are usually two or three groups of families with ten or more little ducklings following mom and dad. We would go up every weekend and each weekend the duckling count has gone down until there are only 3 or 4 left. I just don't have the heart to tell her where they are going to.  Two summers ago I was fishing a back bay full of stumps one morning with my wife and I saw a small duck trying to take off from the water in the back of the bay, it was trying for all it had to get off the water but was a little too young or perhaps it was sick, directly behind it was a huge wake of a very large Musky that followed it about 30 yards around a bend and then I heard nothing. I told the wife but she just laughed and said ""No Way"" Wish I could have got that fish to bite. LOL"
298566,jwl,2009-01-28 17:25:00,1056,"mmmmm....smells like fish, tastes like chicken   I have witnessed muskies taking ducklings off the water a few times while sitting around the boat club in Chippawa where the Welland River and Lyon's Creek meet at the mouth.  Every season there are small famillies of ducks and ducklings milling about, if it's been quiet in there and not much boat traffic coming in and out I have seen for example a mother duck with 7-8 ducklings swimming about, then out of no where..a big SPLASH!!!!, the mom duck goes nuts and when things calm down 1 duckling is missing."
298764,Jigger,2009-01-29 01:29:00,1237,Good 'ole Pikled Duck. Don't see that too often.
299040,Fishnfiend,2009-01-29 16:08:00,357,"I have seen goslings get munched on Dalrymple.  The only way to know if you have a fowl-eating fish is to check it's stomach contents (kill it).  So, for those that catch and release, just assume that you caught the biggest/baddest predator in the lake and let it go (after a pic of course)."
299048,Headhunter,2009-01-29 16:23:00,5703,"Brian, try cooking the duck down first, then use the duck fat to fry the Pike... HH"
