297055,Zebco,2009-01-25 16:07:00,123,"I'd go deeper and look for people who are going to the same spots everyday, they are probaly on fish."
297056,shane,2009-01-25 16:08:00,652,Chum with neon noodles.  The fish will find you.
297069,Guest gbfisher,2009-01-25 16:44:00,0,They can be in 20 fow and  110 fow at the same time. Food dictates where they will be. Certain spots are better than others like shoals and flats. You have to keep looking for them until you find them like GCD said. If you fish a spot for longer than 15 mins and dont mark anything MOVE!!! Keep moving until you get on the fish. The next time yer out. Start where you left off. Was out yesterday and limited out before 10 am....myself anyway.   The others with me didnt do as well but did catch fish. Other people only 50 yards away didnt mark any fish while we marked consistently all day until we left. We walked out by the way. Keep at it.
297092,Sinker,2009-01-25 17:13:00,8692,"Yep, mobilty is the key. Don't sit and wait for them to come to you, go to them. If your not marking within 30 mins, keep going. I like to stay away from crowds, the middle of nowhere seems to work best for me. I usually head out past all the groups, and start in the middle of nowhere......nobody around for miles. I never fish structure.......just the middle of nowhere......kinda wandering aimlessly. I usually move about 500m at a time.  I find the williams brings them around, the badboys get the job done..........so far this season anyways.  Last year it was the williams all season, the year before it was set lines........every season is different...locations, baits, jigs........just keep atter.  Sinker"
297094,misfish,2009-01-25 17:25:00,29133,"Like most have said,MOVE AROUND. If you do find them,try to keep your excitment to a limit,or you,ll have a crowd around you.   Where have you been fishing? This would help with directing you. I got no probls giving some spots."
298660,codered,2009-01-28 22:14:00,123,"  Thx for the advice guys .. I started fishing on monday left shore on the sleds @ about 8 am  moved around every  half hour.
