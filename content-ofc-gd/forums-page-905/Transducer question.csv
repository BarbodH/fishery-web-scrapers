298378,Spinpin,2009-01-28 03:09:00,12,"Hey all, searched but can't find any info.....just bought a x67c and was wonder about turning it on without the transducer in the water. Will this harm the unit?...I've seen vids on ice fishing where a guy pulls his vex transducer out when fighting a fish....thanks for any info"
298386,Pigeontroller,2009-01-28 03:22:00,2793,Won't hurt it. I've turned my Lowrance unit on in my boat many times...
298417,River Rat,2009-01-28 04:28:00,161,na you're ok......  RR
298424,Sinker,2009-01-28 05:12:00,8692,Mine seems fine when I forget to turn if off when I pull it out of the lake
298680,NANUK,2009-01-28 22:54:00,797,"I asked the Lowrance rep the same question at the Boat Show , the answer was "" Doing so for a prolonged period like for several hours or a whole day might fry the transducer"" Joss @ Angling Outfitters told me the same thing as well."
298683,Sinker,2009-01-28 22:57:00,8692,"Yes, if you leave it on for a long time, it will get hot, and may cause damage. I've left mine on long enough to drain the battery in the boat, but still works fine. It was a cool fall day though.......maybe that helped? I know icefishing, its not gonna get too hot!!! LOL  Sinker"
299237,Spinpin,2009-01-30 00:17:00,12,"Thanks for the replies, i can't wait to try tthis ice machine out....been reading a lot about it and looking forward to catching more fish though the ice..........enjoying this forums info.....thanks again"
299358,Vanselena,2009-01-30 11:07:00,269,"  If this were true then UltraSound equipment, car rear sonar, robotics, which use the same technology, would also burn out."
299520,Bitsmith2k,2009-01-30 20:43:00,396," pretty sure if you use an ultrasound without the lube, it can/will burn you and burn out the unit.."
