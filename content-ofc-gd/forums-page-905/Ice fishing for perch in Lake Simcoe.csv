299117,mclovin655435,2009-01-29 19:23:00,6,Going ice fishing for perch in Lake Simcoe. does anyone have any tips?
299150,Terry,2009-01-29 20:53:00,14456,I was hoping  you  were giving the tips   I like to find some weeds  15 to 30 ft  move after 15 minutes if you don't get into fish
299151,Riparian,2009-01-29 21:00:00,269,"What kind of tackle have you got? Id bring some really small ice fishing jigs, a small spoon and a jigging rap.  are you fishing from a hut or are you mobile?"
299155,RickOnt,2009-01-29 21:09:00,669,"As Terry and Rip have said  Find a weed line and keep moving till you get fish, a  small Jig such as the Genz Worm tipped with a Maggot/Waxie or Imitation re Gulp Alive,  Or Minnow Head.  Or the Smallest jigging Rap in Perch or Glow color.  The last time I was out for Perch off Gilford they were in 22-28 FOW.  Have FUN  Rick"

I always use one ultra light with 4lb test size eight or so red hook and minnow, with two small splitshot, and one the other line i'll jig with a small spoon or badboy type lure. As already mentioned if you arent catching move and keep moving till you find em."

299394,mclovin655435,2009-01-30 14:08:00,6,Thanks to all for the reponses. I'll be fishing from a hut(Mitchell) and will be out over night. Thanks!
299408,Riparian,2009-01-30 14:47:00,269,"ok, so you will have a bucket of minnows with you. Send them down on a small jig and wait for the bite. If they arent biting, downsize your jig. If that dosent work, try tipping a spoon with a minnow or minnow head."

299481,Fisherpete,2009-01-30 19:07:00,1814,"If you are fishing for perch, I'm not sure that overnight is the best time... I don't think they are very active at night. I have fished until around an hour past dark, and found that they shut down around then. Anyone else have any experience with perch at night?"
299508,cityfisher,2009-01-30 20:12:00,959,"The perch arnt very active at night.. id stick to Small minnows and grubs, and move often until you find THE SPOT"
