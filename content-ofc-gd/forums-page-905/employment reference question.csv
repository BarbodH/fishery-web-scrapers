299402,Beans,2009-01-30 14:34:00,3339,"""It is our opinion that you would be lucky to get him to work for you !""  Sueable ???"
299422,Headhunter,2009-01-30 15:27:00,5703,"Not likely Beans... it's simply not worth it to a company to pursue these types of things. It's too expensive, even for companys that have legal retainers. Most will chalk it up to experience... and some folks wonder why companies take so long making hiring decisions? You can expect the life cycle of a hire to be even longer in this economic slow down... every hire is now under a microscope. HH"
299429,Uncle Buck,2009-01-30 15:35:00,1000,"so what's the difference with a bad product/service rant...  lets take snowfari ice fishing...  basically the rant a while back has hindered his financial standing, what keeps him from turning around and sueing all the negative nay-sayers???  as a business owner, i'd appreciate someone telling me the truth about an individual and do the same to others...  If i've let someone go/or someone left, why wouldn't i share this info?  all the time/training/screw ups i've had to swallow due to an uncapable/unloyal worker, why would i want someone else to go through the same dissappointment i did?  on that note, i've never called anyone inregards to checking someone's references when hiring an individual...  my logic is the individual knows who/where he's wronged a company and therefor won't put them down as a reference anyways... now whats the point of me calling them and listen to a guy brag about how great an employee/worker he was... if he was so great, why'd he leave...  main thing i look for is loyalty... if someone is constantly changing jobs, year here, year there, there's a reason he's constantly changing jobs...  bottom line is a resume is mostly B.S./lies. you see how/what a person knows when they start working  It's a shame that all these laws/policys are in affect to protect the employee, what about the employer?  buddy decides to quit, he packs his tools and leaves... if i want to let him go, it's 2 weeks notice he has to get... where is my 2 weeks notice, apparently that doesn't matter... only the dude who gets up and leaves has rights...  i know not all people are like this, but out of the 50 or so that we've had here, only 3 or 4 have given 2 weeks notice"
299433,DRIFTER_016,2009-01-30 15:52:00,10439,"  I have always given notice when leaving a job. It's only right and it was how I was raised. It's not right to leave an employer short, unless that employer is a total   then it's OK"
299436,Headhunter,2009-01-30 16:07:00,5703,"U.B., welcome to the world of the employer! As I mentioned earlier, the laws in this province are skewed towards the employee... You are not hiring machines, your hiring people and we all know that people are nuts! LOL HH"
299557,Radnine,2009-01-30 22:36:00,1538," Wow, talk about one sided. For every employer being affected by the situation you have painted, there has got to be 1000 people that got screwed over by employers, no? Why do you think that rules are were put in place (or for that matter, unions or labour laws)? I think that human resource types need to keep in mind that they too are only employees, and only human. Jim"
299250,Rizzo,2009-01-30 00:46:00,4754," well said! There is lots of good information here. Although he made my life extremely difficult, I harbour no ill will and would never deliberately spread misinformation in order to ""get back at someone"". I'm not about getting even. What I would like to be able to do (in a world without lawsuits) is just be able to tell the truth! For certain roles he would be ideal, for others you would be nuts to hire him...but even telling this, what does it benefit me? I will stick with confirming dates of employment and leave it at that. Thank you all for your advice."
299361,Chris,2009-01-30 11:34:00,405,Gotta admit.....I am shocked and surprised that an employer can actually be sued for telling someone else the truth about a past employee. Political correctness taken to new heights!!! Unbelievable.  
299386,Headhunter,2009-01-30 13:50:00,5703,"It's the way of the world ChrisS! There are reasons for it, some valid, others, well, I think you can surmize what I'm getting at... it's typically people who expect to get more out of life, than they are willing to put into it.. if ya get my meaning! HH"
298887,Big Cliff,2009-01-29 09:50:00,6899,"After being an employer for many years I always appreciated (and kept confidential) any honest referances that I got from former employers.  Being a smaller company a ""bad hire"" could cost us a lot of money, money that we couldn't afford. I was always very careful when phoning for referances to explain; who I was, that no written record was being kept of this conversation and that it would never be shared with anyone outside of this conversation, I would outline the job description, duties, and responsibilities then ask if they thought the person being considered would be an ideal candidate for such a position. Their response wasn't as important as their atitude in responding.  When being called for referances I would only confirm that the person had worked with us, if they were a really good employee and left for a valid reason I would always mention that to the caller and indicate that if they were to ever want to return we would do our best to re hire them. If they were not a good emplyee I would simply state that I really couldn't stay anything more for legal/privacy reasons and fear of reprecussions.  That usually got the message across loud and clear."
