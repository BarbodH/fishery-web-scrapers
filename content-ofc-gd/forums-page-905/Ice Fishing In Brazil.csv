298877,young_one,2009-01-29 07:51:00,620,"Very cool, I would never thought there's water under grass/bush/soil, what ever it looks like. They are catching fish much bigger than what I caught through ice. (catfish of similar class?) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr0hdY_94K8 Brazilian Ice Fishing"
298912,Beats,2009-01-29 12:58:00,543,"That's wild.   COuldn't figure out what they were doing for the first min or two.  Actually, I'm still not sure."
298914,Roy,2009-01-29 13:07:00,13728,"Thanks for the link, Young One. We tend to get caught up in our own little world never giving much thought to what other folks around the world are doing. As long as I can discover and learn, I'll be a happy dude."
298918,coreyL,2009-01-29 13:14:00,15,thats pretty crazy best part about that is your holes never freeze up
298924,e-z-out,2009-01-29 13:30:00,1052,makes me want to try that one day. Ok it's time to get some sleep and then hit the ice on simcoe
298928,Leecher,2009-01-29 13:49:00,7832,Unbelievable.... I'd never thought there would be water under that grass and mud I wonder how deep the water is under that  They seemed to know what they were doing and hit the honey hole Thanks for sharing young_one Leechman
299558,Leecher,2009-01-30 22:56:00,7832,Bump.... Check it out guys.... amazing!!
299577,xeon,2009-01-30 23:54:00,350,That was so cool. Nice looking fish too eh?
299589,highdrifter,2009-01-31 00:19:00,2534,"I'm like wwhaaaaaaa??!  Thought he was yanking out tasty lilly roots or something..  Then it made sense..  Your typical bog situation, only tropical!  Great pattern on those fish and that's pretty vivid coloration for something that spends most of its time in the dark.  KEWL!!"
299590,purekgw,2009-01-31 00:24:00,585,i know what im tryin in my backyard in the spring
299592,MJL,2009-01-31 00:29:00,2427,"Totally awesome! Those fish in the vid look like tiger shovelnose cats.  I have always wanted to catch those along with other big Amazon cats like the red-tail, jau and the giant piraiba which have been recorded to over 500lbs.  My dad is from Guyana and he used to fish for catfish there when he was a kid. Would absolutely love to do a trip down to South America in the future.  Thanks for posting"
299595,hammercarp,2009-01-31 00:35:00,964,Here's one that goes along with the theme of this thread. It shows the origin of kite fishing. It's a great example of human ingenuity.http://tobi.gmu.edu/tobithings/fishing/baldwinkitefishing1977.pdf
