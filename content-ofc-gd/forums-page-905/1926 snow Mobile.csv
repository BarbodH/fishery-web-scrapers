298797,purekgw,2009-01-29 02:14:00,585,i can see my foot getting sucked in
298803,solopaddler,2009-01-29 02:25:00,8605,"That's amazing, the mode of propulsion is ingenius, way ahead of it's time. Surprised the concept never caught on."
298805,BassAsin,2009-01-29 02:29:00,806,it certainly is an excellent concept and well ahed of its time but i think it would have caught on had the use of tractors not gone out the window. or jsut not enough people could afford?   none the less very very clever.  Matt
298807,solopaddler,2009-01-29 02:39:00,8605,"And here's the modern day ice machine that no one can afford LOL!  <object width=""480"" height=""295""><param name=""movie"" value="""
298810,DRIFTER_016,2009-01-29 02:41:00,10439,"Man, that's pretty slick. I could use one up here."
298812,Sinker,2009-01-29 02:46:00,8692, My thoughts exactly!!  Pretty slick rig for sure!!  Sinker
298816,Bernie,2009-01-29 02:50:00,3190,A more modern version could work well on thin ice and water for rescue.
298822,JohnF,2009-01-29 02:59:00,3494,"  Does that thing make anyone else think ""Buck Rogers""?  JF"
298849,Dozer,2009-01-29 03:50:00,896,Lets see them do some tricks on that Snow-Motor.
298901,Spiel,2009-01-29 12:06:00,9065, So when do you start construction Bernie? It's a pretty sound looking concept.
298948,irishfield,2009-01-29 14:37:00,26272,"Man.. my Zetor will never look the same, off to the shop! lol"
298972,bigugli,2009-01-29 15:02:00,6138,"A machine well ahead of it's time.  Great concept, but came out in 1926, just prior to the depression, when few would have money to spend."
299013,Bernie,2009-01-29 15:35:00,3190, Let me see......Maybe Wayne could make up the pontoons. I will get the power train together. Thinking a 1200 4 stroke Rotax would be the ticket there. Belt drive to reduce the weight and simplify. Build it to keep center of gravity low to reduce risk of rollover. Ya it could work. Question the sideways slide thing though?
299076,Dano,2009-01-29 17:14:00,719,That is pretty cool. Felt sorry for the horse though.
299162,Abraxus,2009-01-29 21:23:00,104,"Actually that isnt that far fetched.  The Russians were working on similar technology in the 40's and 50's.  Several prototypes were made and then the idea was disgarded.  Having said that, check out the following links for other wild snowmobile ideas that others have created.  http://www.darkroastedblend.com/2007/03/cu...nowmobiles.html  http://www.darkroastedblend.com/2007/12/un...nowmobiles.html  Some are cool, others are just nuts!

299239,BUSTER,2009-01-30 00:21:00,1336,Iam sure the horse kicked that owner when he had a chance!
