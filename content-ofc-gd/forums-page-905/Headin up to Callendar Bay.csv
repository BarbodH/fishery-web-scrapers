298723,Brian,2009-01-29 00:31:00,33,"Hey guys and gals,  Headin up to Callendar Bay on Sunday AM for a couple days to try for some eyes.  I was just wondering if anyone knows how much ice there is?  Will I need to get an extension for the Jiffy or will it be OK without?  Has anyone been up and had any success?  Thanks,  Brian"
298740,BassAsin,2009-01-29 01:01:00,806,been havin lots of success from hearing buddies talk and ice anywhere from 16-22 inches across the bay.

298982,icedude,2009-01-29 15:09:00,459,24- inches of solid safe ice when we were up last weekend  you should be fine without the extension but..our auger head was pretty close to the hole so maybe yes   lol  your call  Have Fun  Paul www.lake-simcoe.ca
299010,BassAsin,2009-01-29 15:32:00,806,"i would bring the extension anyhow just in case you end up in a shack and need to drill a hole inside,   remember the height of the floor brings you off the ice 12-20 inches."
299029,Sherriff,2009-01-29 15:55:00,252,"Was there last weekend.  We struggled.  Two nice eyes in the slot so they had to go back.  One nice pike and a few decent perch.  We caught tons of mud puppies, many more than previous years....  Good luck, hope it turns on for you.  Had many fish come up on the flasher and look at our offerings but they would not commit....
