299495,Headhunter,2009-01-30 19:40:00,5703,"Hey Folks! Considering getting out on Cooks Bay on Sunday and have a couple of conditions questions: 1) Anybody driving their vehicles on Cooks yet? (4X4) 2) How much snow is on Cooks now?  Thanks, HH"
299516,Terry,2009-01-30 20:31:00,14456,"they were driving trucks on cooks  but there is a fair bit of snow now which is weighing heavy on the ice, so when you drill holes water is coming up from the holes which does cause slush fields , but that is second hand info, and you might be fine if you are running out to the main fishing areas where the snow has been compacted by the traffic"
299566,Sinker,2009-01-30 23:23:00,8692,"I can't speak about cooks, but there is a good bit of snow out from JP, and all the way to beaverton, so I would think its safe to asssume its the same all over.  Trucks were out from JP yesterday, but they were struggling to get around. Looked to be better off the main path actually.  Sinker"
299584,Headhunter,2009-01-31 00:07:00,5703,"Thanks Terry and Sinker! My main concern is snow depth, I don't want to get my truck stuck, that more work than I care for! If the snows too deep, well I'm back to the same problem! Man I'm gettin lazy as I get older! HH"
299621,luv2drift,2009-01-31 01:32:00,147,just fyi The ice formed quit strange this year on cooks and the thickness varies everywhere from how the winds blew the ice in and on piled up.  I drilled a  hole three days ago that was 4 inches.......  Use at own risk.
