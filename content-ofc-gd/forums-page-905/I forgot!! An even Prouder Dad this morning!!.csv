299002,bigugli,2009-01-29 15:24:00,6138,"WTG.  Only one problem for you TJ.  Once she's good at it, she'll be bagging all the game and guess who'll be doing all the cleaning? Part of the Daddy duty when we share our fave pastimes with the kids."
299049,capt bruce,2009-01-29 16:26:00,820,"My son and my wife took the course together and when we told friends they were like hes a kid and shes a women , huntings gross and we can understand you  but them .That was  a few years ago and  now when I look at the close relationship my wife (35+ years and going strong) and my son and I have , I really belive alot of it comes from the bond we made from all those hours spent out doors HUNTING and FISHING together. The lessons about respect for fire arms ,the respect of takeing a life for food , of the wonder of nature , I can go on and on  about this , so for all those people that told me hunting is gross I NEVER HAD TO WORRY ABOUT MY SON JOINING A GANG OR EVER POINTING A GUN AT ANOTHER PERSON . So good for you T ,you and your daughter will spend countless hours together , time that others only WISH they had with their familys ."
299056,Leecher,2009-01-29 16:34:00,7832,That is great news TJ Congratulations to Jaden and you  Happy hunting!! Leechman

299189,Daplumma,2009-01-29 22:27:00,1961,Good deal TJ..Thats worth a few more pounds(kilos)in the old freezer.My daughter passed her exam years ago but never went hunting after getting it.She founds boys I guess but the boys had to respect that she could hunt them down like the rats her dad said they were.Way to go Jaden.
