298160,Raf,2009-01-27 16:34:00,3495,you're a terrible terrible man  like a pusher!!  i better consult the accountants first.  thanks though!
298161,ccmtcanada,2009-01-27 16:37:00,7971, Come on...everyone has one...everyone loves it...just do it....  No problem....just let me know...
298341,Big Cliff,2009-01-28 01:29:00,6899,"The power of OFC, last night I couldn't find one any where, tonight I pick pne up at Cliff's hand delivered from Toronto. I really appreciate all the effort Cliff and naturally the visit with the family!  Thanks again!"
298376,ccmtcanada,2009-01-28 03:04:00,7971,No problem at all Cliff.  You'd have done the same for anyone else here if you could help them out with a problem!
298407,GBW,2009-01-28 04:00:00,8460,Good to see one Cliff helping another Cliff out.. now go get fit!  Um er I mean go USE the Wii fit and have FUN with it...
299421,Carp,2009-01-30 15:27:00,1488,"  That's great news Raf. Bad news for the fish. I can just imagine the excuses: - .....""but honey, it wouldn't be nice to let Raf go fishing by himself."" - ""Oh, by the way, Raf asked me to give him a hand at the lake this weekend."" - Saturday....um...well....I'm kinda busy. Raf has some new equipment and asked me to help him figure out how to use it."" - Raf was all set to go fishing this weekend, but he's having problems with the car.  Let me know if you need any help with the move-in. I have trailers/mini vans, etc. Sending you a pm with my cell # bud.   I didn't get back to you quick enough about the Wii availability in my area Big Cliff. Glad to hear it all worked out and you got your Wii. Enjoy it!  cheers"
297813,Big Cliff,2009-01-26 22:06:00,6899,"Been trying to find one, Wall Mart Peterborough  sold out, Zellers Lindsay sold out, Future Shop Peterborough sold out. No one seems to know when they will be getting more. Boy for a country that is supposed to be in a recession I am amazed that games would be so hard to find! Anyone know where I might find one? I don't like the idea of ordering on line but would from a reliable source."
297816,misfish,2009-01-26 22:28:00,29133,Guess I better back off on the posting of these dinners eh Cliff.
297818,xeon,2009-01-26 22:32:00,350,"Just ask walmart when their going to have them in. Also you could try EBgames (online too), look in the yellow pages for game stores aswell. I think The Source may too. Futureshop.ca or Bestbuy.ca may aswell. Maby even Tigerdirect.ca.  Think that about covers it. And if none of those work, well, there is no hope.  OH get the NEWEST ravin rabbits game, its like the only other game you can use the wii fit for and its awesome. And it is the only game you can play with your butt."
297819,ccmtcanada,2009-01-26 22:33:00,7971,Cliff...I'll check around Toronto and GTA east...if I can find it I'll gladly purchase it and bring it up to you...now on to the search....
297823,walleyejigger,2009-01-26 22:34:00,876,"our future shops sux @$$, so now i order anything i want from them thru futureshop.ca"
297834,nancur373,2009-01-26 22:48:00,1211,EB Games in Mississauga (Mavis/Britannia) Has 5 consoles left. Was in there today. All Futureshops in Mississauga are out but are told they will be in on Friday.  Curt
297835,GBW,2009-01-26 22:49:00,8460,Cliff you can order from the web site and have it sent to your local store for pick up too.  Let me know if you do not have one yet in a few weeks as I plan on going to Fenlon Falls area in 3 or so week and I can try and help out too.  Geoff
297841,Big Cliff,2009-01-26 22:58:00,6899,"Thanks gang, looks like ccmt might have a line on one for me. We'll keep you posted.  Brian, I thought you said you have been loosing weight eating all this good food."
297849,mikegta,2009-01-26 23:04:00,39,i assume by fitness you mean the wii fit and not the fitness coach game???? i had a handful of the fits and just sold the last one to a friend but i think he has changed his mind and is looking to sell it(ill ask him)  there is a good skiing/snowboard game that works with the fit as well  i got them from toys r us.   if my friend is is not selling or has already sold it i can talk to my mother in law as she works for ups and can tell me when and where they are being shipped   pm if you are still looking
297858,Silo Buster,2009-01-26 23:25:00,81,Some Shoppers Drug Marts actually have them.
297859,Big Cliff,2009-01-26 23:27:00,6899,"I guess you are right, it is Wii Fit (golf and a bunch of other games). And yes, we are still looking!"
297860,GBW,2009-01-26 23:29:00,8460,"Cliff, do you have the normal Wii unit already?  or do you need the Wii + the Wii Fit?"
297862,mikegta,2009-01-26 23:35:00,39,"i hope i didnt confuse anyone(or maybe i am confused)lol  the nintendo wii is the game console(golf,bowling,fishing .......... ) the wii fit is a balance board  add on(exercise,skiing,snowboarding and alot of balance games)  mike"
297874,GBW,2009-01-26 23:59:00,8460,That's why I asked what I asked too Mike.  If we all went out looking for the Wii fit add-on and he had no Wii console to use it with then we would be feeling a bit foolish...
297875,Big Cliff,2009-01-26 23:59:00,6899,"No, I'm sure it is me that is confused LOL. The Wii consol with the golf, bowling.... is what I am looking for to start with. So many options?????  GBW We don't have anything yet."
297884,GBW,2009-01-27 00:06:00,8460,"Thanks Cliff.  So you are after a ""Wii console"" and the ""Wii Fit"" is an add-on-option.  The fit is a balance board and if you are thinking the Wii will help you get a work out then spend a few more and bet the ""Wii fit"" balance board and a game for it.  Sure the ""Wii"" on it's own can help but it's just games that you can do with little movement.  My wife uses the ""Wii Fit"" every other day for her work out now and she loves it."
297887,motv8tr,2009-01-27 00:08:00,2587,The toys R us in Barrie had at least three of them last Monday...you might check with one in your area....I'd offer to pick one up for you but don't have the money  Maureen
297918,misfish,2009-01-27 00:57:00,29133,"We have been Cliff. Working out has kept us, Wii fit LOL."
298057,Big Cliff,2009-01-27 09:22:00,6899,"OK, now that I know what it is I am looking for, Wii consol and the Wii fit to go with it LOL Let the hunt continue. I am going to try Wallmart in Uxbridge today and a few other places, if anyone finds one, give me a call on my cell phone 705-928-8899  Thanks  Cliff"
298081,jediangler,2009-01-27 13:22:00,1923,Before x-mas they were getting 48 wii fits at Best buy. I got to the store 10 minutes before they opened to see 150 people in line. Bought a brand new one off Kijiji for $140. Probably from someone who was in line ahead of me that morning. It is a cool toy for sure.
298095,Carp,2009-01-27 14:02:00,1488," I live @ Brittania & Mavis in Mississauga Cliff. We have EB Games, Best Buy and Future Shop @ this intersection. I'll check them out & get back to you."
298126,Raf,2009-01-27 15:26:00,3495,"sounds like you don't want wii fit. you just want the wii console and wii sports (baseball, golf, boxing, bowling, tennis) - great game.  hey carp, we're gonna be neighbours as of this wknd."
298154,ccmtcanada,2009-01-27 16:22:00,7971,Toys r us at Yonge and Eglinton has about 30 in stock...minus one!!  I have it for you Cliff...I'll see you later tonight when you come to pick it up.  I'll PM you directions to my place.
298155,Raf,2009-01-27 16:23:00,3495,i wish you hadn't told me that cliff..  might be minus two.
298158,ccmtcanada,2009-01-27 16:29:00,7971, It's just across the street...want me to get you one too??? LOL.
