I know I couldnt do it but I have alot of friends that worked there through highschool and didnt mind the pace of it all.  If youre looking for another job in highschool head to your local grocery store, easiest job you will ever have and a lot less stressful (part time jobs should NOT be stressfull)  good luck bud, I know as soon as I got a job I started buying fishin stuff all the time!"
