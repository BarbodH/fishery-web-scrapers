298895,singingdog,2009-01-29 11:35:00,1047," I agree with you about car/handheld units. There is a difference in some higher-end handhelds in terms of sensitivity, and the ability to pick up reflected and distorted signals. Something like the 60cx will get a good signal in places that cheaper units may not. Not an issue on the water, but great in terrain or thick trees."
298461,ChrisK,2009-01-28 13:00:00,2772,I have a Garmin 255W. Its great and I can take it on land or water....If I spent more time in the bush I would of opted for one of the smaller Garmins but this 255 is a do everything workhorse.It also comes in a 250 which is not as wide.  Good Luck !!
