194115,bassslinger,2008-04-29 23:46:00,21,That's a great post. You will get a lot of life out of a reel if you maintain them like that. One thing I find handy is using my air compressor with a blowing attachment. It makes stripping the old crud out of the gears and bearings easy. Just make sure there isn't any small parts that can go flying. Hold a cloth or paper towel around the part your blasting. I use liquid wrench for stripping the crap off. Works good. Mike's Reel Repair is the source for most schematics if you happen to loose the one for your reel.
194236,fishnsled,2008-04-30 02:43:00,3520,That's some awesome info there!  Thanks for taking the time and putting it together.

299084,kemper,2009-01-29 17:48:00,2232,"Yep, Ive done it as well. Takes some time out of your day and eases the mind a little.  I prefer doing my pin though.  Open, three screws, POP, degrease, POP, sewing maching oil, three screws, close.  Total time, 3 minutes lol"
184292,goteeboy,2008-04-09 04:12:00,175,"yeah, one of these days i'll do the baitcaster, but you can see some from tackletour which will also reconfirm the grease/oil question.  but the reason the oil/grease makes sense to me is that, you want the bearings to roll as smoothly as can be.  and the viscosity of grease would just slow it down, whereas with gears, you want stuff that will stay in the teeth of the gears.  at least that's what i've read.  i have read some mix oil and grease for gears to make it even less viscous.  but for the bearings, oil. i guess the confusion comes cuz we always pack grease into our wheel bearings on our trailers, but there you are dealing w/ a lot more wear/tear and the smoothness doesn't matter as much. anyway, my two and a half cents  http://www.tackletour.com/articlereelmaint...urecordpg2.html"
184428,holdfast,2008-04-09 16:57:00,1813,Thanks your right as to the confusion ref wheel bearings.  I always thought that since the reel is sealed in grease with bearings so would the bearings in grease.  Im wrong but Im glad Ive been told the proper way.  Good thing I havent touched a reel since before the Balanced Rotor days.
184439,Reef Runner,2008-04-09 17:07:00,980,WOW.  Awsome post and some great how-to there.  Thanks for taking the time to share.  It'll save some here $$$$ for sure.
184442,ccmtcanada,2008-04-09 17:16:00,7971,Excellent post!  I may practice on one of my reels that I no longer use to make sure I don't mess anything up on something expensive...  I'll be taking TONS of pictures as I take it apart though...that's great advice.
184714,goteeboy,2008-04-10 02:11:00,175,"yeah, about 15 yrs ago i took apart a middle of the road shimano baitcaster and as far as i know its still apart, God rest its soul. but back then i had absolutely no idea what i was doing and no aid of the internet to read up and learn. but now i'm pretty confident that if i can take it apart, i can put it back together. i also found that my daiwa tierra spinning reel was a bit more complicated than the typical shimano."
184732,mepps,2008-04-10 02:29:00,1301,nice work!
184742,Maverick,2008-04-10 02:52:00,371,"Nice, I might try this with one of my crap reels, no way I'm doing that to my stradic though!!"
184814,corvette1,2008-04-10 12:25:00,1765,great info thanks for taking pictures that will help a lot people
193913,muskymike,2008-04-29 19:02:00,772," Going to attempt my Stradic tonight, will let you know how it goes."
