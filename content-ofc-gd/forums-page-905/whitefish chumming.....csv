296679,codered,2009-01-24 17:32:00,123,Fishing simcoe  last few days  and while cleaning a whitefish yeasterday   went in to the stomack  and to my surprise found spagetti noodles . have you ever heard of chumming with  noodles? I have heard of barley salted minnows even corn butt spagettie noodles?
296683,Fang,2009-01-24 17:41:00,1330,"AAAAHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!  Finally the secret is out. We've been doing this for years. Take uncooked spaghetti and break it into teeny pieces- no bigger than 1"". Cook thoroughly and drain. Put into a ziploc bag and here's the secret part. Don't tell anyone  Go to the grocery store and in the baking area you'll find NEON food colouring. To the ziploc bag add in a few drops of whatever color turns you're crank. I usually have 2 bags with me, one green, one orange or red.  Many days if I do take a whitefish home, I've found some of my chum inside the stomach. One bit of advice though, only put down a small pinch every 30 minutes or so. You want enough to just keep them around not fill em up. The bits of spaghetti seem to glow on the bottom when you drop a camera down"
296684,centerpin_drift,2009-01-24 17:43:00,94,"Up at our lodge in temagami we had people chum with everything you could imagine.  We use to chum our huts with hundreds of pounds of salties but some people didn;t think that was enough, and added everything from barley, corn, noddles, bread and even chicken bones down the hole in efforts to bbring the whities in.  The salties where the only thing that worked, and when we dropped the aqua view down at different times, the lake bottom was covered with poop people had dropped down the holes.  All the whiteys and lakers i caught out of our huts had stomachs full of salties, and on occasion barley, but the noodles and chicken bones just cluttered up the bottom."
296686,Sinker,2009-01-24 17:45:00,8692,"Yep, it works. I find Mr. Noodles are the easiest. Just break them up, boil them for a minute, and your golden.  Whities aren't the smartest fish around. They'll eat anything if you put it down there for them.  What Fang said about the quantity is bang on. You want just enough to get them interested, not feed them. If I stop marking fish on the graph, I'll put a little bit down. Sure enough, as soon as it gets close to bottom, here comes the fish agian. I like to just pop the air bladder out of live minnows myself........especially if I'm using them for bait too!! Just 5 or 6 is all you  need at a time.  Sinker"
296704,johnnyb,2009-01-24 18:36:00,3413,veerrrrry interesting!  *note to self: buy noodles and dye
296746,GBW,2009-01-24 20:52:00,8460,I was thinking the same thing...
296808,TroutnMuskieHunter,2009-01-24 23:02:00,1362," Hmmmmm...with this freezing cold weekend, I'd stick to noodles and rye myself"
296828,Terry,2009-01-24 23:45:00,14456,"just remember, it is really easy to sour the area if you use too much"
296832,Rich,2009-01-24 23:56:00,3927,Does this work for other species? I know I've used salties & bread crumbs to bring in perch and crappie.
296907,anders,2009-01-25 02:57:00,1168,quick tidbit for you guys as well.  Dont chum with corn...although it works wonders fish can not digest it and they will plug up there intestines and die.
296929,centerpin_drift,2009-01-25 03:30:00,94,"good tip anders.. ive cut open many bows with giant abses in their intestines with a piece of corn right in the middle of it.  ive also seen many stocked trout ponds where the owners bait and chum with mass amounts of corn, gotta wonder if they are doing any good or just causing harm."
296980,young_one,2009-01-25 06:08:00,620,"Being Chinese Canadian myself, and Chinese New Year is here. Will the whitefish take my white rice? easier to chew, smaller to digest."
296981,centerpin_drift,2009-01-25 06:18:00,94,rice is difficult to digest too.. why dont you just try NOT chumming with everything in your pantry and fish like everybody else
297018,codered,2009-01-25 14:06:00,123,"Thx for the replys guys  .. i just thought it was  strange to see noodles out there.. going out monday once again  to try my luck . ""im leaving the spagaeeti at home  "" may need to eat it for dinner...."
297067,POLLIWOGG,2009-01-25 16:40:00,835,"This is how a guy told me to chum...  You take a can with the top cut out, put a hole in the bottom to thread a line through so what you have is a can on a long line. put your chum in with a stone and cover with a tissue   held with rubber band. You lower the can down to the desired depth and give it a jerk to rip open the wet tissue and your chum is all right where you want it.   Ive never tried it."
297173,GBW,2009-01-25 20:58:00,8460,now you have me thinking.  I bet if you were to use pasta soaked in hot sauce the fish would come and then PREFER your bait after one sniff of your chum...
298864,irishfield,2009-01-29 04:46:00,26272,Mr. Noodles... I dropped mine at lunch today... and got a Whitie shortly there after! LOL
299073,Zebco,2009-01-29 17:06:00,123,Sure it isn't intestines?  I cleaned alot of fish and the bigger ones all have a noodle looking sack in there gut?
299254,codered,2009-01-30 00:51:00,123,for sure it wasent intestines it came from the gut sack...i played around in it for a while  and  yup it was spagettie  ...  no meat balls i was hoping for surf and turf.....
299318,walleyemaster,2009-01-30 03:38:00,325, i dropped my line down the hole and i got a bowl of mister noodles..thanks wayne
299521,fishermccann,2009-01-30 20:46:00,655,"I got a bowl of Mr. Wayne, thanks  Noodles!"
