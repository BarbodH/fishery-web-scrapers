But I am recovering (disobeyed doctors orders to not do any shovelling and paid the price in a big way). So listen to your doctor and make sure your relatives have internet and cable before you stay with them...thats what I learned this month Good to be home guys!

I am betting that they will refuse to even acknowledge that traumatic DoS attack foisted on us by he who must not be named.  It was pretty turvy, not to mention topsy as well, also.  As you can see, they almost got things back on an even keel, but still, I feel a lot better knowing teh webmaster is back."
