299153,Stoty,2009-01-29 21:07:00,2910,"Now that I have your attention...lol.  Just wondered if anyone has had success fishing Okeechobee?  My buddy just offered me a 12 day trip, staying at his grandparents place, to fish Okeechobee from March 18-29.  We will be launching out of Clewiston, and running in his 21ft Ranger with 225. So anywhere on the Lake is fish-able.  Obviously the lake is pretty weed-choked, but just wondering if anyone has found a certain technique(s) seem to outproduce others?  Cheers, *Stoty"

299174,Stoty,2009-01-29 21:32:00,2910,"LOOOOL, thanks dude"
299181,Kirk,2009-01-29 22:06:00,347,Don't let the ex hear about any new found wealth...LOL  Nothing brings a dog back into the bushes with her nose on the ground than the smell of money.
299183,darsky,2009-01-29 22:10:00,586,no matter how warm it is-DON'T dip feet in the water
299187,GBW,2009-01-29 22:18:00,8460,"Stoty, check out Scott Martin's site as I think it's his home lake so there may be tips there...  just guessing though..."
299192,Radnine,2009-01-29 22:33:00,1538, How did you score alimony?
299235,Greencoachdog,2009-01-30 00:08:00,8163,Live Golden Shiner fishin' is the way to go for the big boys!!!  Artificials won't catch much over 3 lbs.... unless you hook a Alligator on a buzzbait!
299276,holdfast,2009-01-30 01:36:00,1813, I almost lost my noodles on that one
299279,holdfast,2009-01-30 01:38:00,1813,"  Just wondering out of curiosity, With or without Bobber.  Seen one of the shows where they used a Ballon."
299299,Jigger,2009-01-30 02:29:00,1237,I'm living vicariously through you Stoty. Have an awesome time man!
299337,rbaquial,2009-01-30 04:23:00,968,"I remember watching a couple TC shows of doing SHINER FISHING at Lake Okeechobee...and as HOLDFAST mentioned, they were using BALLOONS as their bobbers...? Hope you have fun!! Report back to us with pics... I heard there are PIGS in that lake!"
299380,Stoty,2009-01-30 13:38:00,2910,"Ya, I've done the whole live shiner thing, but this time, my buddy and I are going with only artificials.    P.S - Let's just say that my (soon to be) ex-wife, has A LOT more to lose than I do! So...if she wants to play hardball...so be it! I will end up with a 21ft Ranger, brand new SUV and my own house!"
299385,Greencoachdog,2009-01-30 13:48:00,8163," I'd go with BIG plastics then, 12"" plastic worms and 8-10"" plastic lizards!"
299390,Stoty,2009-01-30 13:57:00,2910,"Both of which, I do not have living in Ontario! haha Thanks GDC, I'll have to keep my eyes open at the Spring Fishing Show in a few week!"
