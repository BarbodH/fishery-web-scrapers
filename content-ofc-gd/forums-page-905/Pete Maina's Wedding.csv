296635,GBW,2009-01-24 16:03:00,8460,Well Pete I wasn't sure if you wanted one of you with a fish or this one...   
296673,Roy,2009-01-24 17:21:00,13728,"I put the fish one up. If he steps outta line, up goes the rake pic merged together with Marc's kilt pic."
296758,Pete Maina,2009-01-24 21:07:00,213,"Good afternoon. Too darn cold to    - today ... my favorite: below zero and windy.  Yikes! I'm good with the pink hat and all - but goodness, please, please ... no merging with Marc and that silly kilt.  I'll be good, I promise."
296976,Markystang,2009-01-25 05:56:00,131,Congrats! All the best in the future for the two of you!
297033,Dano,2009-01-25 15:27:00,719,"Congratulations Pete, I wish you and your lovely bride all the best.  I gotta admit though, I was kind of hoping John Gillespie was going to step into the hole in the ice, that would have been perfect."
297078,David Chong,2009-01-25 16:56:00,836,AMAZING & pretty cool!!!!
297141,Pete Maina,2009-01-25 19:46:00,213,"Thanks a bunch folks. It sure was a great time and a memorable experience with some great friends.  (Ah comon' Dano ... you know we'd all miss the Gillesp's soft voice)  You know, that raking pic sure looks good about now ... ready for spring already here."
297254,Dano,2009-01-25 23:25:00,719,"No, no Pete, I didnt wish him any harm, just thought it would be funny to see him tripped up with a soaker is all."
297608,Pete Maina,2009-01-26 14:55:00,213,"Hey Dano,  Oh no worries man ... didn't really think you meant John any    ills.  John is actually fairly consistent providing funnies (which he sure did at the wedding, as his wife Trish would routinely shower him with warnings   ) ... I've been lucky enuf to have tons of laughs in the boat and on ice over the years ... possibly the most infamous was his falling down in the boat while setting the hook ... ending up with an armload of baits, still smiling, laughing ... and we got the fish"
297634,Jessy F,2009-01-26 15:35:00,3,Congratulations!!!  What a awesome way to do it!!!
297949,Pete Maina,2009-01-27 01:51:00,213,"Thankyou so much Jessy  (Again), gonna be great to see many of you in Toronto in a few weeks."
297967,Joey,2009-01-27 02:39:00,9122,"Awesome, congrats Pete.  That's a great video.  Joey"
298345,Pete Maina,2009-01-28 01:45:00,213,Hey Thanks Joey! Hope to see you in Toronto
298891,Marc Thorpe,2009-01-29 11:09:00,621,"I know why the bride is smiling  So take the photographs, and still frames in your mind Hang it on a shelf in good health and good time Tattoos of memories and dead skin on trial For what it's worth it was worth all the while  It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right. I hope you have the time of your life.  Congrats to both of you  Beauty words Bly"
295754,JenTavolacci,2009-01-22 14:26:00,68,Hi OFNers!!!  Pete got married on New Year's Eve and it was filmed for the John Gillespie's Waters & Woods show. I know you can't get that show in Canada so I have put a clip up on our website of a great scene that you all should get a kick out of. Here is the link: Pete Maina's Wedding Clip  Enjoy!!!!  -Jen
295756,BillM,2009-01-22 14:30:00,17367,HAHAHA!!!!   Congrats Pete!!!!!!!!!!!!!  (Although I was expecting pink hats  )
295759,Bly,2009-01-22 14:35:00,1556,"May God be with you and bless you. May you see your children's children. May you be poor in misfortune, rich in blessings. May you know nothing but happiness From this day forward   Congratulations!!!!"
295768,tbayboy,2009-01-22 14:52:00,1497,"That's great, congratulations to the happy couple!"
295793,Abberz,2009-01-22 15:55:00,140,Hilarious....did Pete cut his hair for his wedding you think?
295802,Roy,2009-01-22 16:05:00,13728,"PETE!!! Now THERE's a personal best you'll never be able to beat! Congrats to you both! I have a question for you though. Does the Gillesp dude have to be with you ALL the time? That's a keeper clip for sure. Thanks so much for posting that, Jen. Gunna be smiling here all afternoon now."
295807,John,2009-01-22 16:26:00,2956,Well done Pete. Thanks for the vid clip Jen.
295847,Pete Maina,2009-01-22 18:45:00,213,"Hey OFNers,  Happy New Year & Happy Winter  Jen let me know she posted this up here. Thanks, or at least I think.  Thanks for the kind words all. Love your post specifically Bly. Thankyou!  Here is a link from blog of lady (great friends; her husband Jim one of the best ice anglers I know), Hannah Hudson, who did photography (scroll down for some wedding pics). Many of you Canadians can appreciate the Polar Bear plunge pics too http://www.stonehousephoto.blogspot.com/  Possibly some of you here will be able to see Gillespie's show ... I did watch a preview of full show John sent across last night ... funny stuff.  Yeah Roy, John G. usually is with me pretty much everywhere I go. (You're just glad he's not at your place drinking your beer   ) Thanks for the thoughts though man.  And hey Roy, and all you OFC'ers - am I gonna see you at the show in Toronto in February?? I'll be there the 13th & 14th ... and would be great to see you!!! (And Roy, I've got a pink hat for you buddy.)  Pete"
295854,BUSTER,2009-01-22 19:45:00,1336,congratulations !!!!   see you at the febuary show.

295883,Greencoachdog,2009-01-22 22:07:00,8163,MARRIED???   I didn't even know he was pregnant!!!   Congratulations Mr. and Mrs. Maina!!!
295920,douG,2009-01-23 00:18:00,2693,"That was in poor taste, GCD, but it was still funny.  I also wondered about the Kentucky Waterfall.  'O! SQUIRREL brother, Your tail, my hair, We are one. Yet I must eat you.'   Congratulations to your happy Bride, and good luck to you both."
295934,Pete Maina,2009-01-23 00:41:00,213,Great. Look forward to seeing you there Buster!  You folks are great ... you're right about GCD's comment DouG ... funny.  Thanks Guys.
295941,misfish,2009-01-23 00:46:00,29133,Only in Canada EH.LOL WTG Pete. You got a keeper there.
295969,TJQ,2009-01-23 01:56:00,7806,Congrats Pete... see ya at the show!!
296011,smbhunter,2009-01-23 04:08:00,186,Congratulations Mr and Mrs Maina.  See you at the show. Will you be at Bass Pro for the Fishing Classic again in March?  All the best. Take care.
296013,GBW,2009-01-23 04:24:00,8460,Congrat's Mr.Musky um er Mr and Mrs Maina... Love your info on the show and with luck I'll be at the TO show in Feb. to say hi and thanks. Cheers!  To many good years for you both!!! Geoff W
296015,GBW,2009-01-23 04:26:00,8460,"PS. Pete, why don't you hit up Roy or TJ to get you a nice avater for you..."
296167,JenTavolacci,2009-01-23 16:20:00,68,A don't think I mentioned that I fixed the song samples from Rockin' Fish Tales. You can listen now. GREAT SONGS! I love the Catfish one.   Listen Here to Rockin' Fish Tales  -Jen  ggrrrrr! I just fixed what Pete is talking about below.
296182,Pete Maina,2009-01-23 17:06:00,213,"Hey Thanks all of you!  That's great to see that many of you will be making the show in Toronto.    Be great to see you all!  SMB, I'm still not certain on the Bass Pro store. I may be spending the Sunday there, while I'm up in Toronto. As far as the spring classics, it appears unlikely at this point. There are so many new stores ... it appears I will be at both the Cincinnati & Rossford stores in OH, and the Detroit store on classic weekend.  Good idea GBW ... say Roy or TJ ... whadduya got for an avatar, EH?  (FYI that I checked out the samples Jen, and for some reason the ""skunked"" song plays The Next Bite song ... others seem fine.)"
296201,GBW,2009-01-23 17:49:00,8460,Here's a good one... 
296273,wuchikubo,2009-01-23 21:22:00,1114,Congrats Pete!!!  Carole's words were great (I'll have to remember those somewhere.)  May this be the start of many great memories together to come.  Stan
296309,OhioFisherman,2009-01-23 22:37:00,6623,"Great! I got married in park on Lake Erie, a Gazebo near the launching ramp. Wife wouldn`t let me go fish though.  Congrats to you and your wife Pete."
296354,Pete Maina,2009-01-24 00:05:00,213,"HI,  Seems like that would work GBW.  Thanks a bunch Stan, and yeah Carole's words were nice.  That's a great story about the launch ramp Gazebo wedding ... no fish eh?  Thanks for the kind words.  Pete"
