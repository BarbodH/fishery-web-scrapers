299234,Leecher,2009-01-30 00:06:00,7832," I just googlemap ""lac des deux montagnes"" to see where it was and man that's a big body of water Any decent size eyes in that lake and what other species can you target??"

297280,Leecher,2009-01-25 23:59:00,7832,"Well guys the plan today was for Whitespinnerbait , Fishing 24/7 and I to head out to Lac 31 Miles and try for the first time for whities.   Left home at 7:00am, temperature was -24C and little overcast.  Snow was lightly coming down while driving.   Got to destination at around 9ish and just before driving onto the lake..... a couple of these guys stop for a quick snapshot    A doe and her fawn.....  There were tracks everywhere  24/7 knows a good spot on that lake but unfortunately for us the path on the ice road to that spot was covered in deep snow and being in a sunfire did not venture there    Instead we tried another spot.... got setup and did not take long for Kevin aka Fishing 24/7 to hook into a beautiful laker..... but no pics of that one, back she goes..... OOS  Then it was Paul's turn to hook into a decent fish but never seen the color of it because his line got snapped  Kevin got another laker and back she went..... we moved to another location near some islands in about 20 FOW.... I managed my first laker on a Swedish Pimple tipped with a white Gulp fish fry..... back she went  I got into another and lost it at the hole      Kevin took some shots while I was fighting it.... here they are        Man that thing was huge and fortunately for her she spit my spoon at the hole..... Then not long after Kevin hooks into his first whitie     and what a beauty    Took another shot of it    All in all was beautiful day, caught 7 lakers and one whitie Thanks Kevin and Paul for a fun day..... we'll definitely do it again Hope you enjoy Leechman"

Le plan d'eau est très bien aménagé et ils sont en abondances  Merci encore!    Thanks weedline.... Much appreciated!"
297526,Whitespinnerbait,2009-01-26 12:03:00,2038,Sure was a beautiful day to be outdoors.....    Man the Lakers were on fire !!!!!!!!  Since 24/7 gauranteed his girlfriend that he would be bringing home whitefish for supper..    I settled for a meal with a t-bone and not a y-bone       Here my catch of the day....      The Three Amigo's .
297534,solopaddler,2009-01-26 12:58:00,8605,"Good job lads! My place in QC is infested with whitefish as well. Although I havn't been up in the winter very much, the few times I have I've never been able to locate numbers of them.  I have caught tons of them in late June when the mayflies hatch in the evening. My entire bay is teeming with rising fish then....  One of these days I'll figure them out! Good luck to you guys hopefully you can crack the code."
297539,wallyboss,2009-01-26 13:07:00,1095,Good job the Amigos!!!!
