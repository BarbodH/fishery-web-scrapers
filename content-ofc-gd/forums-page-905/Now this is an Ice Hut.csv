298987,GBW,2009-01-29 15:14:00,8460,WOW!!!!
298992,bigugli,2009-01-29 15:19:00,6138,I wouldn't be home til it was time to pull it off the ice come March
299016,johnnyb,2009-01-29 15:41:00,3413,"Seen that one around for a while now...it's amazing.  There was an even better one on YouTube, but I can no longer find it...basically a tranport trailer done right up...called it the Bellagio or something...named it after one of the big Vegas Casinos...."
299019,coreyL,2009-01-29 15:44:00,15,im speechless on that one its like ice fishing in your living room
299020,Lunker777,2009-01-29 15:46:00,866,hahahah HOLY !!!! that is awsome ! Makes me want to move north where there is a decent ice season !
299035,Abberz,2009-01-29 16:04:00,140,Any builders or handy people out there who might know what it would cost to build something like that?
299038,LeXXington,2009-01-29 16:08:00,1928,"LOL, thats better than my college apartment"
299106,rob v,2009-01-29 18:47:00,535,"That would be a nice unit to have,  the bad thing about it you wouldn,t want to leave it out on the ice for fear of somebody helping themselves to all the goodies.  comfortable while you,re using it but probably a bother to have to keep an eye on !"
299124,diggyj,2009-01-29 19:46:00,548,That is one sweet looking setup. Does't mean they are catching fish though.
299125,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-01-29 19:52:00,0,if it had a keg fridge i could live in it.
299157,BUSTER,2009-01-29 21:19:00,1336,"wow thats the best hut i've ever seen, i've saved every photo!   if i copy a hut , thats the one!! perfect setup.."
299165,lunkerbasshunter,2009-01-29 21:24:00,2585,that thing is awesome!  i could really get into ice fishing in that thing!  Cheers!
