It is only rated for safe operation at 0 celcius, but it performed well the other day in -17C. Any way, the fish did not dissapoint, and i got to give a shout out to 2 young Youtube fans of mine, they are gonna be super excited, makes me smile.  "

1037906,Joeytier,2018-12-14 01:15:00,3990,Where's the expedition?
1037923,limeyangler,2018-12-14 16:01:00,5204,"It’s in the yard, we hardly have any snow so I am taking the quad, it’s waaaay better on gas. Also the temps have been mild and on one of the trails there is a beaver dam and stream that goes across the trail. It is usually frozen but not this year, and when it’s not frozen it is usually only a couple inches deep but it’s up to the wheel arches on the quad this year, not really wanting to go through it on the Expedition ."
1037927,jimmer,2018-12-14 19:03:00,2730,Do you ever see anyone else out on the lake?
1037928,limeyangler,2018-12-14 20:33:00,5204,"Thanks Brian, don't know why, but sometimes I paste the link and the video thumbnail shows, sometimes not."
1037929,limeyangler,2018-12-14 20:35:00,5204,"Oh yeah, the tracks that you see in this video are mostly mine, but on this trip out there were new skidoo tracks that were not there a few days before. I work lots of weekends and I'm off during the week so have the lakes to myself a lot."
