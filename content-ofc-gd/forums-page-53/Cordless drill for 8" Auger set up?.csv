It's a little overwhelming.  have a older 18v dealt and also a 20v dewalt ion. What's your guys cordless set up?"
1038493,SirCranksalot,2018-12-30 14:34:00,3291,"Many recommend at least 700 in-lb for a 6"" so more, of course, for an 8"". Milwaukee have 1200 in-lb drills---fairly expensive though. There are often pkg deals with drill plus batts posted online. Google is your friend! "
1038494,BillM,2018-12-30 15:26:00,17367,I've got my Dewalt 20v on a 8in finbore and after a few holes (Depending on ice thickness) she'll start to smoke a bit.  I'd definitely look into the M18 Fuel line if you wanna turn that thing all day without any issues.   Early season ice however (6-8in) cuts through like butter with no problems.  We're talking 12-18in where it will start to overheat.
1038495,G.mech,2018-12-30 16:00:00,830,Lots of input from last year on the topic here: https://ontariofishingcommunity.com/topic/85612-will-an-18v-drill-turn-an-8-auger/?page=3
1038496,misfish,2018-12-30 16:07:00,29133,"8"" with fuel gen 2 brushless through 10"" of ice. 10 sec    Same set up through 18"" of ice. You need to lift and clear when you got thick ice. With the 8"". I have gone to a 6 now and it,s like Bill said. Cuts like a hot knife through butter.   "
1038500,porkpie,2018-12-30 18:04:00,2521,I run a fuel with a 6 inch auger.  It will make Swiss cheese of ice.  I ran a 6 inch on a standard Milwaukee compact with 500 inch/lbs for a couple of years with no problems whatsoever.  I only upgraded to the fuel because I wanted a hammer drill anyway and Home Depot had a special last year with an impact driver and 5ah batteries.  It’s pretty awesome and I can get 50 holes on a charged 5ah battery through a foot of ice and that was with the Milwaukee compact.  Haven’t tried it with the fuel. My buddy uses the dewalt but he was already invested in dewalt tools and batteries.  He runs a 6 inch as well but I don’t think he’d chance the 8 due to plenty of user feedback that the dewalts can’t handle the 8 inch for very long.
1038501,BillM,2018-12-30 19:19:00,17367,"I can get about 10-12 holes in fairly thick ice with my DeWalt 20v and the 8in Finbore before she starts giving me problems.  If you want something to run and gun all day, M18 Fuel is the easy choice."
1038508,Garcia96,2018-12-30 20:57:00,45,Thanks for all the replies everyone! For the guys using the 20v dewalts is it the $130 one or the 400? Ixr I think it's called.
1038513,misfish,2018-12-30 22:16:00,29133,"Do not sell out the dewalt so fast. Last year walking out at 6 am, both Terry and I came across a set up left behind. Turned out it had fell off a smitty. I was able to get a hold of the owner. Need less to say, since I found it,I thought why not give it a try. Sitting out on the ice for 12+ hours over night, it worked just fine and cut my holes for the morning.LOL It was a 20 volt drill. "
