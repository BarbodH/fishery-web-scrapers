Will have to do a video of this, was a spur of the moment kinda thing so did not have my cameras, but got a snap with my phone as the sun set.  "
1038003,SirCranksalot,2018-12-17 14:11:00,3291,"Hey, folks, for those of you living close to Simcoe ""Don't try this at home""!!?"
1038004,AKRISONER,2018-12-17 15:17:00,5558, you mean to tell me the scugog locals havent brought out their pick ups yet?
1038007,BillM,2018-12-17 15:58:00,17367,My old ZR2 having some fun out on Simcoe a few years back. 
1038013,misfish,2018-12-17 21:16:00,29133,"Remember the days when I could launch the chevette at Tiffin launch and go all the way to Keswick. If I got stuck,get out,leave in drive and just push it out. LOL Not as fancy as your trucks though."
1038016,GBW,2018-12-17 22:57:00,8460,I really like that ZR2 trim package on that truck!  Lots of nice looking accessories for it too!
1038017,David Chong,2018-12-18 01:17:00,836,Beautiful looking truck! I'd stay off off lakes up here for a while!
1038024,Sinker,2018-12-18 14:20:00,8692,"I""m keeping my boat ready for Jan. 1st opener here lol"
1038025,limeyangler,2018-12-18 14:54:00,5204,"Yeah, they did a good job, a nice upgrade from my 2006 Colorado. I get random people coming up to me commenting on it being a nice truck. It was not cheap though, spent waaaaaaay over budget, but hey, we are here for a very short time in the grand scheme of things. WOW, 'id miss my winter adventures. saying that I'm done with winter by the end of February and there is still at least 2 months to go by then?"
1038032,huzzsaba,2018-12-18 22:14:00,884,so do you fish from the comfort and heat of the truck??  Nice truck btw
1038036,GBW,2018-12-18 22:55:00,8460,"Oh and check your truck for the following:  #18-NA-351: Unwanted Deployment of Roof Rail Airbag, Driver and Passenger Lap Pre-tensioner Deployment - (Dec 5, 2018)  It's a new one and not all VIN's are affected."
1038044,limeyangler,2018-12-19 00:40:00,5204,"I got my notification a week ago, my VIN# was affected."
1038053,GBW,2018-12-19 03:28:00,8460,It's just a software update.  Don't go 4x4'ing if you don't do the update ASAP as the A-B may pop on a stiff bump.
1038054,limeyangler,2018-12-19 03:31:00,5204,Would make an interesting video....lol. 
1038093,GBW,2018-12-19 22:50:00,8460,"HAHA, you might end up a bit dizzy from the impact but hey, your call...  LoL"
1038126,pics,2018-12-20 18:55:00,1268,I had an 07 Colorado.. Most reliable truck I have ever owned and I still see it driving around town..
1038130,Raf,2018-12-20 21:59:00,3495,Nice.  Is yours the diesel?  I have a 17 non-ZR2 with the diesel.  Love it!
1038133,limeyangler,2018-12-20 22:35:00,5204,"Mine is gas, ZR2s have a similar hood to the diesel."
