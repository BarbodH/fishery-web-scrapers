1037827,singingdog,2018-12-12 12:25:00,1047,"Have seen folks out on several lakes this week. Talked to one group: 5"" of good ice on smaller lakes with no current."
1037830,chris.brock,2018-12-12 13:22:00,4053,Good to know. How much snow is up there? We are trying to choose a lake for tomorrow.
1037845,misfish,2018-12-12 19:20:00,29133,"Tomorrows Thursday, work day, what the hell ?"
1037846,ketchenany,2018-12-12 20:13:00,3229,I was home today!!! Don’t like Wednesday choice for this week.
1037848,chris.brock,2018-12-12 21:34:00,4053,"just burning off the last of my vacation days before the end of the year, if I don't use'm, I loose'm, you know how it is Bri How much snow in the bush in Barrie?"
1037851,singingdog,2018-12-12 22:54:00,1047,"Really depends on where you are. 10-15 cms, with a crusty base in lots of places. Get very far north and it is deeper."
1037856,Joeytier,2018-12-12 23:38:00,3990,"8-9"" on most backlakes, great for sled travel and the snow conditions on the trails are great!  It's been a great start to the season for conditions so far this winter, in stark contrast to the awful fall we had."
1037857,misfish,2018-12-12 23:40:00,29133,"Not much up here. Melting fast. As for holidays, I guess I am kinda lucky that way. I still got like 12 or so weeks again. I used up 10 weeks back 2 years ago, when I had my retina detachment. Trying to burn them off slowly. LOL  Safe outings Chris."
1037875,Jds63,2018-12-13 14:38:00,1365,"Hey Chris give me a call if you are up on Sunday .... made an ice rink at the lake last weekend ... 5 inches of ice off the dock, middle of the lake is sketchy"
1037879,AKRISONER,2018-12-13 15:06:00,5558,"was on Gbay this weekend...had 6 inches of solid black ice...obviously anywhere with current still is extremely dangerous, but we got on the ice and the fishing was on fire."
1037949,chris.brock,2018-12-15 01:26:00,4053,"we're back now, I will have some free time between X Mas and New Years, we'll keep in touch we had 3 inches of mediocre ice near shore, 5 inches of soft snow over a couple inches of crusty snow in the bush and snowing pretty good today"
1038089,maker a laker,2018-12-19 21:46:00,33,"Fished Fri-Sunday on North Pidgeon Lake, just south of Minden. South end was solid 5-6"". Middle was only 3"" thick when I stopped drilling holes. North end flooded between Sat AM and Sat PM, fully 1/2 the lake turned black with 1-2"" of water on top of the ice. There was not that much rain Friday ,mostly wet snow, so there had to be a large amount of water coming up through pressure cracks, or creek runoff. Less than half the lake was fishable so ice conditions still not stable. More cold weather required at this point.    "
1038098,huzzsaba,2018-12-19 23:51:00,884,anyone ice fish Halls lake in Haliburton? heard mixed reports about this lake.  Mostly small lake trout from what I hear.
1038105,chris.brock,2018-12-20 03:23:00,4053,Halls freezes up later than the smaller lakes. I think there's better lakes to choose in that area.
1038118,SirCranksalot,2018-12-20 16:00:00,3291,We were in that area yesterday and most of the big lakes were still open or nearly so  i.e the ones we saw along 35.
1038121,Jds63,2018-12-20 16:47:00,1365,"saw guys fishing and ripping around on sleds last weekend !!! on Green Lake by West Guilford .... there was open water by the current areas .. thats crazy if you ask me , but locals figure they know what they are doing I guess ..."
