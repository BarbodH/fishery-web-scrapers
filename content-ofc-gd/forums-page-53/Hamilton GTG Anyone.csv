1038236,Spiel,2018-12-23 15:58:00,9065,"Possibly depending on day, time and location."
1038237,Loonietoon,2018-12-23 16:03:00,1450,At the Legion in Stoney Creek if we can get in.... Dave? Cheap beer ?
1038241,HTHM,2018-12-23 18:17:00,4082,"Depends on the day and time. Set a time and place, and be done with it. Those who can make it will, those who cannot won't."
1038244,Loonietoon,2018-12-23 23:49:00,1450,Need to see if we can get into the Legion in Stoney Creek...This coming Saturday if so there say 1.30pm or so. Waiting for Fish Farmer to pipe in
1038277,Loonietoon,2018-12-25 03:09:00,1450,Canceled cannot  find a place or interest as Usual
1038284,Fish Farmer,2018-12-25 15:06:00,2234,"You can get in the Legion anytime its open Kalvin, you don't have to be a member. Sat. they have entertainment till 5 pm. in the club room. No food though except bar snacks. Come By Chance maybe a better spot or Ale House, just a thought. Hard to get something going around this time of year because of family things going on."
1038293,Loonietoon,2018-12-25 18:03:00,1450,"That is why l tried to set it up between so some that do work can make it out for a few hours, members complain about wanting to meet others on the board and when we try to set something up not to many show only the old member. So l decided to cancel it out. ? Sorry"
