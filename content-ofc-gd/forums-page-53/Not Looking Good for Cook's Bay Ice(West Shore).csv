1038384,David Chong,2018-12-28 02:54:00,836,Had to head up to Innisfil today so I stopped at a few Cook's Bay access points and it doesn't look good! The east wind was blowing pretty good and oddly the further north I went the less ice there was! And with the forecasted weather for the next couple of days is not going to help! We're going to have to wait a little longer Misfish! I guess if we're going anywhere this weekend we better go further north! LOL Stay safe out there!

1038394,David Chong,2018-12-28 14:37:00,836,Our weather just gets crazier & crazier but it's the winds that need to die down along with the colder temps! Hope that you & your family had a Great Holiday Season!
1038395,misfish,2018-12-28 16:50:00,29133,"If we get a a few days of no wind and -10 or more, the whole lake would set up. I have not seen any mist/steam ,coming off the water for a long time. It,s ready to harden up.  I know my feet would like a break from the waders and the cold river waters."

1038403,Fisherman,2018-12-28 20:40:00,7201,"Well tell you what, you stick out your feet and we'll get out our spud bars and give them a poke and watch you dance like a cod jigging ______. ?"
