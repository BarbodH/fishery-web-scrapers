1037322,OhioFisherman,2018-12-02 02:43:00,6623,"Time is running out, but they are pushing 14 pounds now. There will a couple of happy people with new boats."
1037325,Old Ironmaker,2018-12-02 06:45:00,8243,"14 lbs. is a big fish even here on Erie, even Quinte under the ice. It has been very calm here for the last few days here on the north shore at least. Last week Ore boats were being tossed around. I had Zebra mussels on the deck. This lake can be a beast without warning. November is our high wind month. There is a Walleye tourney on Erie every summer, the 444. I think it means 4 days, 4 men, 4 locations, or something close. The north shore tourney is out of Port Colbourne on the east end of Erie. The other 3 are on the US side. The Pt. Coulbourne tourney is sold out months before the date, it was $400 per boat a few years ago when we entered and got blown off the lake in buddy's 21 foot StarCraft both Sat and Sunday, the first few days was like glass, they aren't the big money days. Don't quote me but each location is a 40K first prize. There plenty of pros every year with $100,000 or more barges. I don't know who won the CDN event this year but for the previous 2 years local guys here took the prize. I met the kid that won 2 years ago and his boat was a 17 footer with 4 on board. Better be organized for that and 8 lines, and the boat owner was a massive young lad, had to go 250 or more .  If his 3 mates were even close to the same size it would be cramped a tad and the water line had to be high to say the least. Let us know when the numbers are in my Buckeye friend Johnny D."
1037336,OhioFisherman,2018-12-02 17:06:00,6623,"LOL, John it's a beautiful late fall day here, sunny and bright and the temps will be pushing 60, although they are calling for storms and wind later on in the day. It's looking like one of the nicest days weather wise in the last month, and the tournie ended at 8 am this morning. The weigh in station was supposedly open all night for last minute fish entries, it was raining and blowing last night here so the numbers are probably final? big fish in the open 13.745  30.50 inches and in the kids 11.275  31 inches, better weather might have changed those numbers a bit over the course of the tournament, but I doubt by a lot, maybe a pound or so, it's Erie and those numbers are pretty good for a walleye anywhere? Ya Lake Erie can be a beast any time of year, it doesn't take much of a sudden storm to get it moving. I still recall going out one late fall day years ago smallie fishing and having the fog roll in, we were only fishing less than a half a mile from shore and luckily could hear the trains passing on shore or we wouldn't have known where shore was, I put a compass in my boat before the next trip out. Kind of mixed emotions about this, it's nice to have great walleye fishery close by, but just from experience in my own family and circle of friends it has changed tourism to Canada, very few people that I know that used to make an annual trip up north still do. Different strokes for different folks? The scenery and Canadian experience was always worth the trip for me, good fishing or not."
1038665,OhioFisherman,2019-01-03 17:23:00,6623,Incidental catch from the fall brawl. https://www.toledoblade.com/MattMarkey/2018/01/06/While-still-grand-record-trout-fish-leaves-angler-about-81-000-short.html
1038666,dave524,2019-01-03 17:57:00,4508,"Most would guess the NY State record Laker would be a Lake Ontario fish, nope, Lake Erie as well. The guys fishing the upper Niagara for trout and pickerel during the winter get some slob Lakers there as well."
1038668,OhioFisherman,2019-01-03 18:20:00,6623,"Going back a lot of years to when they used to stock salmon here, my brother and my dad were out one day trolling deep for them and dad got a 4-5 pound lake trout, as far as I know they are a rare catch in my area of the  lake. Also saw a pic of a guy netting a muskie in the fall brawl, another pretty rare fish in this part of lake erie."
1038669,porkpie,2019-01-03 18:35:00,2521,We caught lakers off the lighthouse at long point this summer when trolling for pickerel.  Surprised us but apparently not that uncommon!
1038670,dave524,2019-01-03 18:42:00,4508,"I was the Park Naturalist at Long Point Prov. Park for 2 seasons in the 70's, the deepest point in Erie is just off the tip of the point."
1038671,OhioFisherman,2019-01-03 19:19:00,6623,"Pork, just guessing that long point is at least 100 miles east of the areas I used to fish, deep water so more common?"
1038673,porkpie,2019-01-03 20:24:00,2521,"I don’t know, it was a surprise to us but apparently not to some other guys we talked to at the launch.  We weren’t even dragging bottom at the time, maybe 35 down over 80."
1035456,OhioFisherman,2018-10-19 00:48:00,6623,http://www.lakeeriefishingderby.com/2018-fall-brawl.html Not a bad prize for first place.
1035457,grimsbylander,2018-10-19 01:01:00,3016,Very nice. You don't see many Warriors in this area but they're great boats. I'd be happy with that beast.
1035458,OhioFisherman,2018-10-19 01:17:00,6623,"I don't know much about them myself grim, but it looks like a good boat for walleye fishing here on Lake Erie. They get some real pigs on Erie here this time of year, it will be interesting to see how big of a fish wins it?"
1035472,jimmer,2018-10-19 15:00:00,2730,Looks like a great boat to me.  I'm sure there will be some real local ringers entered in that Derby! I hope it goes well for them weather wise.
1035474,dave524,2018-10-19 15:16:00,4508,"Growing up , the world record was listed as a 22 1/2  pound fish from the mouth of the Niagara on Erie , fishing is better now than then but 14 is about as big as I have heard in the last 20 years.  If I was getting a walleye boat for Erie it would be a 20-22 foot walkaround cuddy."
1035476,OhioFisherman,2018-10-19 16:12:00,6623,""" Anyone can participate from novice to professional angler and have a great time with a chance to fill the top 5 payout spots! "" No need for ringers, it's a wide open event, and I am guessing some charter  captains that spend a lot more time on Lake Erie may have an edge? Many years ago I went out with my dad and my brother for walleye one day, off in the distance I could see something that looked like an island, so I asked my brother what island was that? In  a place I knew didn't have any, no island, boats, it was a circus, people casting, people trolling and seemingly not enough sense to stay out of each others way. Luck will still be a factor! Ya, weather will be a factor, Erie can get dicey quick, and this time of year it's no joke."

1035484,misfish,2018-10-19 17:31:00,29133,I  Thats a sweet boat for sure. That is a serious first place prize. WOW.
1035505,OhioFisherman,2018-10-19 23:20:00,6623,http://www.cleveland19.com/2018/10/18/lorain-county-will-award-angler-biggest-walleye-caught-lake-erie/ It looks like they are trying to make this an annual event?
1035515,OhioFisherman,2018-10-20 15:03:00,6623,"LOL, a shore fisherman in the lead! but I don't think a 7.45 walleye will hold it long?"
1035532,OhioFisherman,2018-10-21 15:56:00,6623,"Actually it seems to have been an annual event since 2011, if you go to more on the heading you can see the yearly results and fish pictures."
1035570,OhioFisherman,2018-10-22 02:53:00,6623,"The bank brigade is still in the lead with an 8.45 fish, and with the storms this weekend it wasn't a boating weekend! Still like 40k people without power in our area, high wind took down a lot of trees and power lines. Just guessing that a rattle trap is still a go to bait for the fall walleye bite from shore."
1035616,AKRISONER,2018-10-23 14:02:00,5558,"man, am i the only one that thinks they ruined a really nice boat with that ugly green evinrude and crappy stickers? If you are going to slap 100 decals on a boat, at least make them match the colour scheme."
1035624,OhioFisherman,2018-10-23 16:07:00,6623,"LOL, but the price is right? 1 walleye? It just has to be the biggest one? They updated the prize list, some serious cash for  2 - 5, and even 1st in the kids division gets a boat."
1035625,AKRISONER,2018-10-23 16:51:00,5558,"$100,000 boat with a bunch of crappy miscoloured stickers and some random green accents... I bet the $20,000 looks better lol i mean at the end of the day, what do you expect from a walleye guys on lake erie, they arent neccesarily graphic designers or guys with a great taste for looks...but thats an expensive as hell boat that look damn good on their own. Look at the one they have on the warrior website...looks like a war machine with nice styling."
1035628,OhioFisherman,2018-10-23 17:27:00,6623,"LOL, ya Akri, the one on their website does look a lot better, even with a Yamaha on it. If I was spending my money on a boat I wouldn't want it decal-ed up like a clown car. Now if someone wanted to give me one for a 30 buck investment? I could probably live with it. I remember some years ago guys from the board used to have a meet and greet fishing expedition at the Bay of Quinte and catch some hog walleye. You would think a tournament like this one might be popular in that area? 4k entries, and the entry fee is basically chump change? If you wanted to increase tourism and extend area resorts business season? A lot of people might be interested?"
1035630,jimmer,2018-10-23 18:17:00,2730,"I don't know.  I find the fall walleye fishing on Quinte very hard, so I wouldn`t stand a chance.  I went to one of those meet and greets once and there was a total of two walleye caught and by the same angler. LOL"
1035631,OhioFisherman,2018-10-23 18:53:00,6623,"jimmer, no idea how the walleye fishing works on Lake Ontario or even on the north side of Lake Erie, so it might not be a workable plan? One of my brothers was much more informed and equipped for walleye fishing on Erie here, but the fall spots don't seem to have changed much over the years here since the rebirth of walleye fishing here. A fall frenzy for walleye on the north side of Erie?"
1035632,Tom S,2018-10-23 19:08:00,362,I think the term you're looking for is 'butterface'.

1035886,Acountdeleted,2018-10-31 12:21:00,2562,Is it just me or does the top kids prize make no sense? Congratulations! You won a boat! You can't legally drive it....... here ya go!
1035893,OhioFisherman,2018-10-31 15:09:00,6623,"LOL, yep no sense! a tiller! https://www.boaterexam.com/canada/education/preface-en.aspx Ohio Boating Laws & Regulations | Boat Ed® Your boating laws aren't much different than ours, which may be the reason for the 40hp motor? I  was tooling around in a small boat with a much smaller motor though when I was young, gives a kid a chance to gloat? dad's car, my boat?"
1036156,OhioFisherman,2018-11-06 15:37:00,6623,"Now those weights are starting to get serious! Looking at the weights and lengths is interesting, some fat fish? Those big ones don't seem to have much trouble finding food?"
