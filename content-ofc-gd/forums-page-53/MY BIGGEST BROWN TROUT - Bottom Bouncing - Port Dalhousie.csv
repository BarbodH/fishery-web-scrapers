1038162,misfish,2018-12-21 21:14:00,29133,"Nice fish We use to fish across the other side at the old factory. Crazy number of browns back then. That was in the late 70,s early 80,s."

1038175,BillM,2018-12-22 00:47:00,17367,"Fatty.  I remember fishing all the way up to the dam as a kid.  On the other side by the 3 falls and that center section sticking out in the middle, lol.   Hooking a chinook and having it spoil you was a common occurrence."
1038176,misfish,2018-12-22 00:59:00,29133,"I,m sure we met at sometime in the past.LOL"
1038180,PUMP KNOWS,2018-12-22 01:47:00,937,yup and it looked to be a fresh one too  Lots of small ones caught today but I've seen some tanks caught this season  Thanks  Thanks.  Have you gotten to fish it the last few years?  Thanks.  My buddy managed to get a bigger one on our next outing.  I can't believe how big they get.  All the way to the dam?  That's crazy.

1038206,OhioFisherman,2018-12-22 17:46:00,6623,""" yup and it looked to be a fresh one too  "" When I was young I was fishing with my neighbor and his dad off a Cleveland area pier and he caught a sheephead with one hanging on it that didn't let go, it was the last fish that one ever bit! I have seen their bites on a few fish, even on a catfish at Pointe Au Baril."
