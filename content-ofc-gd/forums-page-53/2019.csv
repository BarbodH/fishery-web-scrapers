1038569,Old Ironmaker,2019-01-01 10:11:00,8243,We are hoping 2019 is better than 2018. LostÂ  too many friends and Family last year. It's the cycle of life but it still sucks. We here are hoping all our OFC friends a great year. Wouldn't it be nice if everyone treated every day like it was the Holiday season? I've always said that.
