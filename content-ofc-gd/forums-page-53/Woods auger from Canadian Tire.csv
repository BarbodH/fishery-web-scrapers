1038298,verno,2018-12-25 22:58:00,178,"Anyone have any info on the Woods 43cc gas auger from Canadian Tire?  My wife and kids spoiled me with one of those and an eskimo hub for Christmas. I know it has to be a rebranded something else,  I'm just looking down the road when I have to replace parts etc at how hard that is going to be?  From the picture on the box it appears that a lot of the parts on the outside are plastic."
1038300,Fisherman,2018-12-26 00:04:00,7201,"No info but I'll bet most of the different brands all come from the same building but different doors, slightly different handle and paint.  There's a number of brands that all use the 33cc engine, again probably all interchangeable parts.  Unfortunately the amount of plastic used keeps increasing."
1038301,GBW,2018-12-26 01:34:00,8460,Congrats on the cool gifts and I'd bet the parts are the same as Eskimo
1038302,porkpie,2018-12-26 01:34:00,2521,"Take a look at the manual and see if there is any reference to Ardisam .  They are the parent company to Eskimo augers, and have been making the rapala gas augers since they came out as well as a few others."
1038316,Dutch01,2018-12-26 16:56:00,1431,"It's a virtual certainty that the Woods 43cc has the same Ardisam engine as my Rapalav43cc Vortex (Ardisam makes 90% of auger motors). Mine runs GREAT but only after I replace the stock Torch brand spark plug. If yours has one change it out ASAP. I also recommend TruFuel from Canadian Tire. Other guys are going to blast me here saying it's a waste of money, but I use one $10 can per season so I'm not worried about saving an extra $4 by mixing my own gas. Other than my auger has been great and no issues for years now."
1038334,Fisherman,2018-12-26 20:17:00,7201,"Ya, it's a waste of money.  How long has the tru fuel been sitting on the shelf?  Mix small quantities (1L) of non ethanol and synthetic 2 stroke and you'll be fine. ?"
1038335,misfish,2018-12-26 20:39:00,29133,PHOOY. LOL
