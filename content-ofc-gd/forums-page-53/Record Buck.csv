1037938,Old Ironmaker,2018-12-14 22:35:00,8243,Looks more like a Maple tree on it's head. Not sure how I feel about taking a massive animal like that. But I don't hunt. There's no catch and release in hunting. Using a camera is close I guess. Was he too old to breed?

1037957,Old Ironmaker,2018-12-15 04:58:00,8243,"I thought so. Never seen such a huge rack, not on a Deer anyway."
1037970,cisco,2018-12-15 22:26:00,597,"That is just a 'non-typical rack. They measure them completely different than a typical rack. If you Google non-typical whitetail deer racks on youtube and look at the pictures you get some idea.Â  Canada has many too. Also youtube explore Florida Maquis re the Venezuelan thing from another perspective. He is an ex-US soldier and has numerous posts about the goings ons down there. Oh, and the world record typical whitetailed deer is actually a Canadian deer taken by Louis Milo in Saskatchewan about 20 years ago and it is at the Bass Pro Shop in Vaughn right above the gun shop. A full body mount!!!! Hardly anyone knows its there.The most famous deer in history outside of Rudolph. (a reindeer I know LOL!)"
