The good, a custom Sage Float Rod donation build with the proceeds of the raffle going to the LHFC, to support their hatchery program.  http://www.lakehuronfishingclub.com/  	The bad, a rod that after several days of fussing with the wood components of the fore grip I've decided to scrap it and start again.
