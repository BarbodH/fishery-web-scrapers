1037102,cisco,2018-11-27 22:27:00,597,As long as you shoot up and in an inland direction there should be no issue. But common sense should be used for sure. Maybe eagles or other species would visit to eat hat's left after the shooters have left. So I agree steel is best.

1038239,pike slayer,2018-12-23 16:13:00,1177,Go on these islands put some c4 on it. Wait for the birds to return then kaboom! All the pieces of bird go into the water feeding the fish.
1038476,Out4Trout,2018-12-30 01:08:00,98,"The cormies will be hunted deliberately I can certainly assure you. If this passes before April, the bass boats need not worry, as we will have the local lake cormorant free long before end of June (there are only around 30-40 birds on my local lake). They really aren't very hard to hit, much easier than a woodie. They fly in straight lines and don't maverick easily. Any wary ones that escape will soon vacate, not knowing which of the boats has the hunter in it. The days of nonchalantly sitting in a tree 100yds from my boat will be over, which means their communal nesting islands will no longer be used. The best ammo option, and already used during culls, is 22 Quiet subsonic, but that will not be permitted so 12g steel it is.  Bring it on"
1038633,davis,2019-01-02 20:00:00,128,came across a video similar to this one recently of a bird downing an entire bucket of fish in seconds. ? crazy!!! 
1038637,Tootsie II,2019-01-02 22:24:00,162,"I do hope these Reg's get approved. In the last 2 years, I've spotted at least 2 of those darned things on either Sinclair Lake or on the Grassy River between Sinclair and Kapiskong Lake about 25 Km North-East of Shining Tree. I've love to help maybe delay their spread into the Grassy River system although it's probably inevitable."

1036941,Fisherman,2018-11-24 18:48:00,7201,"I think the closest I've ever got to one is maybe 150 yards and with steel shot, even lead,  you'd have better luck with lottery tickets.  Waste of time as far as I can tell."
1036942,grimsbylander,2018-11-24 20:11:00,3016,I love it when I'm flying along and a dumb-azz cormorant pops up ahead and flies along with no real sense of urgency...then they realize they can't fly 60+mph !! LOL I'll take out the front pedestal and install a turret!!
1036943,cisco,2018-11-24 20:26:00,597,"Anyone who knows anything about waterfowl hunting knows it's near impossible to shoot many in a short period of time. All the armchair cormie killers here can find this out at any time. Just go and 'make believe' you are hunting them. Then say how many shots you'd have got inside of... 40 yards/metres.  Keep in mind a few dozen per outting per hunter among allot of other hunters is what is needed at a minimum to get a local pop'n down a wee bit. Go, then tell us how you did. IMHO not enough to harm the local pop'n even if multiplied by 100. Layout boats circling where they roost is probably best. They'd be low to the water. Still that's allot of layout boats and which only allow shooting about 110 degrees around.   Once the birds learn then odds get way worse. These are smart animals. "
1036944,misfish,2018-11-24 20:45:00,29133,That was my point Chris  BTW  Nice to hear from you.
1036945,dave524,2018-11-24 21:01:00,4508,You are never going to reduce the population enough by shooting them to have any effect on numbers but by being able to shoot them we will able to discourage them from colonizing sensitive areas and maybe reduce the breeding success by forcing them to abandon nests.
1036946,misfish,2018-11-24 22:09:00,29133,"So like the old  tale of,, Never release the first fish,as it will go down and tell the rest you are there, and they will disperse.. LOL  "
1036960,Sinker,2018-11-25 14:12:00,8692,"I disagree. I think if you had cormorant decoys they would work them real good at the right time of year. I know I could have shot many boxes of shells at them just this fall alone over my duck spread, easily.  Duck decoys, not so much, but you put out a spread of cormorant decoys, and its game on! S."
1036963,Garnet,2018-11-25 16:18:00,2056,Was salmon fishing and came very close to hooking a cormorant around neck. Little more luck and there would be horrible accident judge sir.

1036984,cisco,2018-11-25 23:37:00,597,"Shane, you like shooting and eating ducks and geese.  You also enjoy walleye, musky fishing and eating among other things like crappie and turkey and deer...  Hard enough time getting out there for these.  To spend the money on dekes, steel shot and to find the time to chase cormies...... Few could/would do it. I sure wouldn't. But I'd sure be happy to enlist as a volunteer for MNR/DFO/CWS to take my old lead shot rounds and join a group to blast nests for a bit. You want to go shoot them? No problem with me. But to look at the proposed Bill vs common sense IS a big difference re getting the numbers under control. IMO as said these birds aren't dumb fly-through young migrants like many of the waterfowl we shoot. They learn quick from what I've seen. Some heros will go and shoot a bunch and brag...... enter the antis.  If you and the few others who would carve or buy cormie dekes and then find the time to DISCRETELY (no pictures) shoot some, fine. IMHO this sure it won't do the job. I bet some would even pay to be on a guided cormie hunt. But in general terms the gov't needs to be honest and to be going with a better solution than to put heat on hunters. "
1037005,HTHM,2018-11-26 03:24:00,4082,How about rock salt at the nests? Or an inert substance like vermiculite or perlite.
1037010,cisco,2018-11-26 10:06:00,597,"Aerial spraying of a percentage of nests would be how gov't would do it if forced to do it themselves. But again, what impact on other species would be a concern. Fake eggs replacing the wild ones is also good idea, but to get into the nests is the general problem. That's why the lead-shot idea came to mind."
1037012,pics,2018-11-26 13:15:00,1268,Birds clue in pretty quickly when it comes to hunters. The first time they are shot at it sticks in their mind. We may have to get creative.. My buddy shoots European house sparrows at his feeder so he has very few around but it doesn't affect the other birds because they know that they aren't the target..
1037014,ch312,2018-11-26 14:27:00,1590,"A cull, which is what this is with a 50 bird limit, is the best option and most cost effective for reducing populations quickly. You guys should be thankful the government is actually considering saving money by allowing hunters to kill some cormorants instead of the usual business of the government hiring someone to do the job. I doubt anyone is going to be targeting them and this is simply a matter of letting waterfowlers shoot some cormorants if the opportunity presents itself while they're out for ducks and geese. Landowners won't need to shoot very many before the rest of the birds catch on and move away for good as birds learn quick after they've seen their buddies get shot. "
1037016,Sinker,2018-11-26 14:31:00,8692,"I'm all for hunting these dirty birds. I'm not saying there will be hunters out in masses, with boat loads of decoys setting up killing them in piles, but at least if we can shoot them while waterfowling it would help, even just a little. I just want the protection removed from them. I'd shoot every single one that came in range, and if I found a spot that had a few, I""d set up on them just for fun. Do I think hunting them is a good way to control their population? Nope. Not at all. Is it better than nothing? Absolutely. Would I invest in some gear to target them? Hell yeah I would. The bottom line is more needs to be done to control these vermin, but being protected isnt helping. I think this bill is the first step to removing protection, so its better than nothing, and I fully support it, and I hope all anglers and hunters do as well.  S."
1037020,Garnet,2018-11-26 14:47:00,2056,I think it should be a requirement to tie a rock to each corrmerant shot with bio degradable cord for turtle bait. Circle complete.
1037022,AKRISONER,2018-11-26 16:04:00,5558,"theres enough of these buggers around that in a good blind in a ""commorant area"" you are sure to bag a few, Once again I have no idea what the regular duck hunter would do with the the dirty bird, but for real, sitting in a duck blind out on the water, they might help pass the time a bit lol"
1037060,cisco,2018-11-27 00:32:00,597,Going forward with the proposed Bill means we are stuck with the cormies. UNLESS under it shooters can descend on the rookeries and scare off the adults and blast the nests during breeding season. I will work with anyone here on this. I have a boat. Would rather use lead. Maybe since we are shooting nests we can do this.   
1037071,dave524,2018-11-27 10:24:00,4508,"Forget about lead near water where there is a chance of waterfowl ingesting it when feeding, heck, we even have to use steel on woodcock in a woodlot or field shooting waterfowl in grainfields miles from any waterbody."
1037078,grimsbylander,2018-11-27 13:29:00,3016,"If you're out scouting for cormorant hunting spots this spring, be careful you don't ""accidentally"" step on their nests."
1037079,Sinker,2018-11-27 14:04:00,8692,No need for lead. Steel shot works fine.

1036844,DanD,2018-11-21 22:32:00,2223,How convenient it is to dump this issue onto the hunters? It won't cost the ministry a dime and if this proposal is passed and doesn't lower the population of birds; they can say we gave the public a chance to make a difference. More politics then remedy!  Not sure what else can be done; but putting a bird that is worthless as table fair is idiotic.  By proposing this the ministry is acknowledging there's an issue with these birds. They need to put their big girl's panties on and get out there themselves fixing this problem. Dan.
1036850,porkpie,2018-11-21 23:37:00,2521,"I agree Dan, but it's a start I suppose.  They are also proposing to amend the FWCA to allow cormorants to spoil so that will remove the table fare concern and put them squarely in the nuisance category.   They've also change the initial bag limit of 10 to 50 it seems.  Too little to late if you ask me."
1036868,AKRISONER,2018-11-22 13:42:00,5558,"lol this law may get the old man the up and go to get his hunting license once again. Hes always dreamt of heading out to one of the millions of rocks that these greasy buggers congregate on and just peppering em with pellets. He thinks he could hit 6 birds with one shot lol. Honest question though, what the hell do you do with the damn carcasses. No one is gonna wanna eat those dirty fish birds."
1036874,Sinker,2018-11-22 15:14:00,8692,Time to start carving decoys!! I could have shot thousands of these by now. Wish they were legal to shoot years ago. I will certainly be spending some time practicing my wingshooting with these dirty birds.  S.

1036914,cisco,2018-11-23 10:34:00,597,Dumb idea. Too little too late. All it will do is further lower the image of hunters as mean-spirited killers with no regard for life. The antis will eat this up and proudly show any and all piles of dead birds they can track down. The answer isn't just shooting but rather the destruction of eggs/nest shooting their tree nests. OMNR and DFO should be doing this quietly. I recall when the issue of controlling deer in Federal parks came up and the gov't decided to not let hunters do it but used their own personnel. Guess they like shooting deer but not cormorant nests. Fed and prov officers should have a plan as to where and when and how to attack specific roosts during nesting season. It's part of their job IMHO. Rather they would lazily sit by as hunters do the work and take the heat. They should also develop means to use the carcasses perhaps as fertilizer. What do rendering plants have to say? Can they use carcasses for something? Has gov't even bothered to research any of this? Deer hides are collected........ and I know MNR doesn't like dealing with the stinky things. Gov't is playing hunters as fools on this one. On a problem gov't has been denying and hiding and is therefore partly responsible for. Wild life officers are out there anyway and should know where and how best to deal with the roosts.   
1036918,Garnet,2018-11-23 14:17:00,2056,I agree with you 100%. Pass me the shotgun they are messing with the wrong guys fishing.

1036927,porkpie,2018-11-23 21:20:00,2521,"Grandpa and his buddies let me shoot a couple mergs  when I first started hunting.  Then he made me clean them and cook them.  Then I got to eat.  The big commons where the worst... Well, lesson learned I guess!  I did run in to some guys on cooks bay a few times at least 15 years ago that shot all they could and said they loved em!  They where from the Rock and I guess they liked the strong flavour."
1036928,cisco,2018-11-23 21:41:00,597,Oh and the same net-canon devices could easily be set up on the rocks the birds frequent. Used them on turkeys so why not cormies? Hunters/anglers/others could still serve as volunteers to help gov't officers do the work. Good way of screening the 'I wanna shoot sumfin!' weirdos out of the volunteer helpers would be to make them aware that before they get to 'shoot sumfin' they must dispatch a certain number of the trapped birds  humanely by hand. Hopefully some gov't types in positions of authority read this and can get some perspective on what to do. Heck right now many municipalities are quietly kerosening Canada Goose eggs. 
1036929,Rodbender,2018-11-23 22:27:00,1027,Best answer right there Birders are already against it cause of other birds nesting at the same time with the nets the other's can be released  BTW I am not a Birder I'm a Photographer so I look on Birder sites to see where cool birds are
1036930,Fisherman,2018-11-23 22:39:00,7201,"It's going to cost prospective hunters some serious cash,  no lead shot.  Ever try to follow one in a boat, damm things fly faster than my boat will go and they are very wary when you try and sneak up on them.  Maybe someone can come up with a way of genetically sterilizing them."

1036937,cisco,2018-11-24 15:59:00,597,"I recall in the 1980's there was serious concern that the cormies would disappear. Huge media uproar happened when some drowned in commercial fishing nets around Bay of Quinte. Well IMHO that pop'n crash may have been from the DDT/mirex/? that was found to be thinning eagle eggs. A resulting ban on the egg-thinning stuff may be why the cormies have exploded. Or perhaps this and the usual case of a pop'n crash due to disease that flows through it. But to try and genetically engineer a solution may be bad for other species if in a consumable format. (Eagles and such also eat same stuff). To capture and introduce a genetic modifier to birds would be a long-term solution since the treated birds would be unable to affect the breeding of other birds. I suppose a spray treatment of nests may be able to get into their system, but again, eagles, osprey, other species landing on the nests would also be affected. The best way to 'treat' the nests is to have shotgun pellets go through. AND since the nests are being shot then no need for steel shot. Volunteers/wild-life officers can dig out the old #4 shot and use full chokes to easily destroy/perforate 'the nests'. Also from what I hear the cormies do not like being disturbed and so the adults leave before the roost is arrived at. They can return to twig-infused omelettes. The Feds just need to pass regs allowing such 'treatment' of nests. Hey and this is just off the top of my head. Anyone in wild-life management paid by taxpayers should be able to fine-tune the idea. Maybe they already have a plan that they quietly want but are afraid to go forward with. Biggest concern to me is that many wild-life management people are into the 'let's get nature back the way it was' mindset. They want nature to take its course and not control native species like the cormies. This is who is standing in the way of anything being done. These are the folks who are denying the cormie impact of fisheries. They are happy to lie about things to attain their end objective. Their mantra is ""The  end justifies the means'. Politicians/Ministers need to know the truth about what is going on. They won't get it from their underlings."
