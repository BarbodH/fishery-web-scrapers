1037627,bobowski,2018-12-07 14:56:00,360,I'll be there. Looking forward to it.
1037641,BillM,2018-12-08 00:35:00,17367,I'll finally be able to pick up some of your warez
1037648,David Chong,2018-12-08 12:12:00,836,Looking forward to seeing everyone there today! Doors open at 9 AM! Please stop by the HT Booth and say hi!
1037656,misfish,2018-12-08 18:19:00,29133,"Thanks David ,made her day. All she could talk about. Look what David gave me. LOL    The show was well, ok. I was hoping it was going to be better then last, but seemed to be the same. There were a few retailers there and yes,they were blowing stuff out the door price wise. Not sure I want to see a meat stand when I first walk in to an ice fishing expo, but there it was.  For me,the show is about seeing the new and meeting up with buddies and shooting the breeze.  I met  up with Chad ( Chuck Enwinde ) this morning. We made a sweet trade off. Finally. LOL Met a a couple of guys I never met. They just asked if I was the loony tooner. I said ya,but I don't have a pen to sign my autograph guys. LOL Had a good chat with guys that appreciated my videos. The granddaughter and I enjoyed our time and we were off across the street to see the jolly ole fella. Not before I picked up my 12 tarts. My gawd they are so good. Ole Santa made my day by saying, smile, your DAD , is going to take our picture. LOL  Time well spent with my granddaughter. "
1037696,misfish,2018-12-09 16:59:00,29133,"Did another quick tour this morning. Not as busy as yesterday. Managed to run into some old friends. Leon. The creator of the Simcoe bug . Still laughing about the day he helped get my truck unstuck 20 years ago. Then this santa looking guy pops up. MR.B, Rattletrap. Have not seen each other in many years. Met his daughter from the board here,al87_outdoors . Wonder gal.  Now to start looking for some ice to fish on. The bug has gotten a hold of me. "
1037700,Fisherman,2018-12-09 18:41:00,7201,"I thought you might be out on the Lake by the condo, 1 walker and 2 huts out on the west end.  One was a red hut."
1037746,KawarthaAngler,2018-12-10 15:55:00,273,I enjoyed my visit to the show.  Hopefully as the years pass it will grow.  It would be nice if there were more vendors there.  Maybe a combined show of ice fishing and winter hunting?  That may result in more diversity and a greater attendance.  Just a thought. I posted several pics on my Instagram account. -> 
1037811,Rattletrap2,2018-12-11 22:10:00,1652,Nice to see you there Sunday Morning Brian! Thanks again for making us aware of the show. I really had a good time and spent some money too! All three of us did! Any chance to get out and listen to some good seminars and browse some tackle on a cold winter day is worth it to me! We did stop by Cabela's afterwards as well and was very impressed with Santa there.
1037967,David Chong,2018-12-15 20:27:00,836,"Had a great time seeing and talking to everyone at the Canadian Ice Fishing Expo! Hope those that were able to take in my seminar enjoyed it, especially those who took pics of the spots on Lake Simcoe that I hi-lited on the screen shots of my Navionics app! LOL They are good areas!!! "
1036298,misfish,2018-11-10 23:38:00,29133,"It,s on for the 2nd year. There were so many great deals last year. Come on up and say HOOOOOOWDY http://www.canadianicefishingexpo.com/"
1036300,OhioFisherman,2018-11-10 23:53:00,6623,"LOL, we have snow on the ground here! So your ice up there must be a foot thick by now?"
1036301,misfish,2018-11-10 23:57:00,29133,"Come Jan 1, I,ll take that Paul. We have had high winds and snow flurries. Nothing sticking around."
1036305,OhioFisherman,2018-11-11 00:13:00,6623,"Just a trace here Brian with winds up to 40 mph, although our typical eastern Ohio snow belt along the lake could get 6 inches. The weather here the last couple of weeks with cooler than normal temps and a lot of windy days makes it pretty easy for me to understand the sort of slow changes in the leader board of that Lake Erie walleye thing going on now, it hasn't been great weather for boats to get out on Erie, and with up to 10 foot waves crashing against the shore line at times it limits that too! Hope you get some good ice, I know a lot of you guys enjoy that kind of fishing."
1036317,irishfield,2018-11-11 01:44:00,26272,"Been a long time since it was ""Molson Park Drive""."
1036318,Fisherman,2018-11-11 01:44:00,7201,Have to keep a spot open for that.
1036321,misfish,2018-11-11 02:06:00,29133,"LOL Back when,the park held the CFGM country jamberie. Big Jim Miss the drive through beer store .LOL"
1036338,Meegs,2018-11-11 11:43:00,249,Looking forward to the show! Been getting ready for months! Make sure you stop and say hi 
1036348,Old Ironmaker,2018-11-11 15:09:00,8243,"Anyone out on this side of the lake would be suicidal with all this wind. All the Marinas, all 3, are empty of boats now. It has been an early exit this year. I haven't been on the lake since Sept. 1st. I even remember the Baseball tourneys we had there. We even played a few games in between sampling the sponsors products. Funny how we were always out by Saturday afternoon. No one was going to play on a Sunday morning after Saturday night. A rookie actually stole home for a run and I thought the old guys were going to beat him senseless. He was bewildered until told why."
1036349,grimsbylander,2018-11-11 15:50:00,3016,I still call it Molson Park Drive lol
1036352,Rattletrap2,2018-11-11 16:54:00,1652,Thanks for the heads up B! I have never heard of this show but will put it in my calendar and try to make it!
1036361,misfish,2018-11-11 19:16:00,29133,"Yup, come meet the man himself. "
1036379,Loonietoon,2018-11-12 05:07:00,1450,I do not REMEMBER SAYING I Would be THERE ???
1036382,Acountdeleted,2018-11-12 13:06:00,2562,Dang. I'm going to miss it again. Moving day on the 8th and we always see the father in law on Sundays. Ah well. Probably best to miss it this year with my knee anyways.
1036455,Tjames09,2018-11-14 03:43:00,664,"Went last year, it’s a small show. Couple small vendors. Probably better off just a trip to cabelas In the area lol."
1036456,buick14,2018-11-14 10:57:00,741,"I was contemplating going, but not anymore.  Thanks for saving me a drive !"
1036457,misfish,2018-11-14 11:13:00,29133,"For the 1st  it was pretty good . This is a ice fishing show, not a sports show, so you are there for ice fishing. With Over 50 Exhibitors under one roof  this year, I am looking forward to it. Although I really do not need anything, it,s good to meet up with friends and  my granddaughter cant wait."
1036458,bobowski,2018-11-14 11:45:00,360,I found the show decent last year. Some interesting new products and lots of information to be had. Not very often do you get that many ice fishing experts under one roof. Looking forward to going back this year.
1036486,Tjames09,2018-11-14 19:19:00,664,"Its good if you live in the are, but I wouldn't drive 90 minutes for it. There are some good vendors there specifically for ice fishing though. Last year I made a day trip out of it and hit up all the stores in the area. Heres a picture they posted of it last year to give people an idea of the size of show.  "
1036515,KawarthaAngler,2018-11-15 15:35:00,273,A true Angler goes to any show they can ;) Looking forward to checking it out. Not much else happening on December weekends anyways.
1036708,David Chong,2018-11-19 20:31:00,836,Looking forward to the 2nd year of this event! It was pretty decent for it's first go last year and I'm sure that it will be better this year! I'm flying on Fri. from the B.A.S.S. Team Championships on the Harris Chain and coming right up to Barrie and the SHOW! Drop into the HT Booth and say hi! I'll be presenting a couple of seminars on stage as well! Look forward to seeing everyone there!
1036711,misfish,2018-11-19 21:02:00,29133,Granddaughter is all happy happy David. Dont forget your tie for the pic.LOL
1036718,David Chong,2018-11-19 21:36:00,836,"Make sure you bring her by the booth, I'll have something for her!!!"
1037624,misfish,2018-12-07 14:38:00,29133,"Doors open at 9am Saturday. Who,s going ?"
1037626,KawarthaAngler,2018-12-07 14:49:00,273,Yup.  A friend and I should be for a couple hours after lunch on Sat.  Looking forward to the outing.
