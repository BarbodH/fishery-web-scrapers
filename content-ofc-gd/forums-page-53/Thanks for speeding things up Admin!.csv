1038330,aplumma,2018-12-26 19:55:00,6896,Thank you we are investing quite a bit of money lately as well as having Chad being our IT guru to get the site both secure and more fun to enjoy. This new path is the shot in the arm we have been looking for and to be honest it would have not been possible if Chad (blueye) had not stepped up and helped us so much. So give a thank you to Chad for all that he has done.  Art
