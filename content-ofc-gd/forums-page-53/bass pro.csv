1038309,captpierre,2018-12-26 14:53:00,2521,Thanks. So they price match?
1038328,pics,2018-12-26 19:48:00,1268,I was at Sail recently.. . Buckshot spoons I like were 5.50 plus 20 % off.. Sails 5.50 regular price was less than the sale price at Cabela's.. Bass pro isn't much better.. They are 8 something at Walmart and almost 10 bucks at Canadian Tire..
1038331,misfish,2018-12-26 19:56:00,29133,Was at Cabelas this morning for boxing day. YAWNNNNNNNNN
1038358,pics,2018-12-27 17:07:00,1268,Sail has 20% off all fishing and hunting gear with exceptions on a few things of course.. Excellent prices on ice fishing items..
1038364,misfish,2018-12-27 18:50:00,29133,Cant spend BPS/CABELAS gift cards at sails. LOL
1038365,misfish,2018-12-27 18:50:00,29133,Sails needs to come to Barrie.
1038372,limeyangler,2018-12-27 23:05:00,5204,"Cabelas and Bass pro are a rip off. Cabelas seems to think it is a fashion brand name and expects you to pay likewise but on everything not just their clothing. Bass pro also sucks. I you would expect a small local retailer to be more expensive than the big box stores, I don't find they are. With the purchasing power these big stores have there should be way better pricing. The Cabelas in Winnipeg is shocking. They are very expensive and have hardly any stock either on site or online, my last visit to Winnipeg I never even bothered going."
1038382,AKRISONER,2018-12-28 02:45:00,5558,"Hit up sail today, better pricing than crappy can, cabelas and bp  and today it was 20% off git  a reel glove neoprene reel cover for $4 jackall rythm waves for $5.50 an pack northland buck shots baitfish style with the rattle, $4 a pop yamasenkos $9 a bag that’s unbeatable considering Canadian tire now charges 12 a bag"
1038397,misfish,2018-12-28 16:59:00,29133,I remember paying $4.99. Inflation is killer. LOL
1038398,lew,2018-12-28 18:07:00,12766,"I joined the Fire Dept in '68 with a salary of $100 a week and that was considered good money and your right Brian, inflation is a killer LOL ?"
1038405,misfish,2018-12-28 21:15:00,29133,Me thinks I started kindergarten that year. LMAO
1038420,GBW,2018-12-29 03:26:00,8460,"Since selling my truck I decided to go back to a manual ice auger.  I can pick one up this weekend at Sail for $65 (after tax!) for a NORDIC TELESCOPIC DRILL 6"" or ship to my door for $80 (again after tax).  No other store in the area comes close to this...  Deal end Sunday for those in need..."
1038427,Backcast,2018-12-29 14:58:00,12,I agree with the current discount  at SAIL of less 20% on most fishing stock and 15% off electronics and motors their prices are hard to beat . Its not like there every day price is inflated either .If SAIL follows the same pattern as last year this will be the last chance at 20% off. Last year during the spring fishing shows and other promotional events the max generic  discount was only 15%.  Good time to  stock up if it fits in the budget.
1038621,jimmer,2019-01-02 15:52:00,2730,"I always swore by yamasenkos, but have since refused to buy them for those crazy prices. I have found a few others that sink at the same speed and seem to do fine. Can't find my favourite colour though."
1038628,Backcast,2019-01-02 18:18:00,12,I still swear by the original senkos but at roughly 10 dollars Cdn a pack it hurts a little more especially when you loose a new  senko to a rock bass or a 10 inch bass. Inflation and a depreciating Canadian currency impacts the price we pay for everything. I assume your 4.99 senkos was around the time the Canadian dollar was on par with the U.S
