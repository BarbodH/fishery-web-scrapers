One method many fisherman employ is to drink their beers fast enough they don’t freeze. But Smith said this method requires an extra step of preparation. “If you’re going to blast a case between you and your buds on the ice, you absolutely must have a bottle of Fireball on hand for the late afternoon,” he said. Smith said burst glass bottles are especially tragic. “You may be tempted to just eat the beer slush, but you will cut up your gums and lips on broken glass something fierce.”"

1038107,DRIFTER_016,2018-12-20 03:35:00,10439,Schnapps works too. Up here you need to throw yer beer in a cooler and toss in a bunch of chemical hand warmers or it'll be froze by the time you git to yer fishin' hole.  ?

1038132,misfish,2018-12-20 22:24:00,29133,"No worries here Bill, next 5 days booked on the river. Care to join? Work for 2 after,then well, see what happens then, but I think it will river still."
1038134,HTHM,2018-12-21 00:26:00,4082,"Silly people, the way to prevent freezing beer is to suspend it by the plastic six pack ring in the ice hole. Then hopefully a cormorant will get entangled in the plastic ring and drown."
1038135,David Chong,2018-12-21 00:48:00,836,That's too funny!!!!
