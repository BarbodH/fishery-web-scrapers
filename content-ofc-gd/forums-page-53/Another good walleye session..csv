Bite was half an hour later than last time, probably because of the clear bright conditions. Got some nice walleye and some bigger ones this time, a 25” and 22” with three just under 18” and a pike, not a bad hours fishing if you ask me. "

Then when I tried to open it my lap top shut down. The bottom right of the screen said ""F1 reboot"" or something similar. Strange."
