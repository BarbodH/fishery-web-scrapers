1038587,Terry,2019-01-01 18:10:00,14456,lol it is better to pose that question on this forum 
1038592,misfish,2019-01-01 19:59:00,29133,LOL
1038593,wkrp,2019-01-01 20:03:00,656,Duh!

1038596,porkpie,2019-01-01 20:15:00,2521,"I really don’t see the need to post something from another forum over here, other than a need to knock someone.  If your really need to know why, maybe send the guy a private message to satisfy yourself.  There is no point to this.  While the forum is a little slow, it doesn’t need this kind of traffic."
1038597,Terry,2019-01-01 20:50:00,14456,"But I totally got his point if I bought something from a store and also needed an accessory for it, I would not leave with the product without the accessory or knowing where to buy it i would not just hope the internet people would have the answers even  Pierre  Elliott Trudeau said about half of what people post on the interweb is a lie."
1038600,porkpie,2019-01-01 21:26:00,2521,People ask for help everywhere.  On every forum I frequent people ask for info on something or other.  Often info they could google or call a store about.  What’s the sense of this post on this forum other than mud slinging for no reason.  He could’ve mocked the dude on the other forum if he wanted to.  Answer that question reasonably and I’ll mail you a new in package AC shiner!
1038603,Terry,2019-01-01 21:44:00,14456,Well you are right there.  But I only responded  to the post    As did others
1038604,misfish,2019-01-01 21:59:00,29133,PM address soon.  Do you have the rainbow shiner one ? J/K.
1038605,porkpie,2019-01-01 22:02:00,2521,"LOL, I probably do somewhere in the basement  Brian!"
1038606,Fisherman,2019-01-01 23:53:00,7201,"Knock someone, some people may need a minor knock to get the thought process activated.  If the particular person had said, I checked with stores A, B and C and struck out, I usually make the effort to go look and give them a direction.    If I stuck a sore nerve with you,  there's always a tylenol in the medicine cabinet."

1038616,glen,2019-01-02 14:48:00,2641,Where are the fish biting that the ice is so thick you need an extension
1038625,Fisherman,2019-01-02 16:29:00,7201,"Ya, when I looked at the auger, it already has the telescoping feature, if you add an extension the crank part might be above your head unless you're 5 foot 24.  The only time I ever needed an extension was in Manitoba,  mid december and the handle went to the edge of the ice and I wasn't through yet,  some of the locals had a good chuckle.  But, being in friendly Manitoba,  they poked a few holes for me and I was grateful."
1038629,porkpie,2019-01-02 18:55:00,2521,The fellow that initially posed the question on another board is using a clam plate which  is quite short when used with an auger on its own.  I made an extension for mine primarily so I didn’t have to bend over to drill holes.  Ice thickness didn’t have much to do with it for me anyway.
1038630,misfish,2019-01-02 18:58:00,29133,Short legged guys like terry and I don't have a problem.
1038634,PUMP KNOWS,2019-01-02 20:23:00,937, haha
1038635,PUMP KNOWS,2019-01-02 20:37:00,937,"I should've rephrased my question to the original post. I bought a Sail branded auger and clam plate to go with a milwaukee drill.  I was looking for an extension for the drill because its short when attached to the clam plate. From what the Sail associate told me, they never carried an extension for their own drills. I was hoping maybe someone would know which brand extension would fit in a Sail branded auger.  Thanks porkpie for the help"
