I can't imagine how much sugar was in it. Those pics are cool JoPa. Is it just me but the new generation of Law Enforcement seem to have chilled since I was younger . Even when interviewed now they speak like normal people unlike the military like verbiage stone faced they used 30 years ago. Very polite as well now, it wasn't always that way. Maybe it's all the cameras on them."
