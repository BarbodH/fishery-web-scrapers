1038221,DRIFTER_016,2018-12-22 22:47:00,10439,This is the regular buddy heater not the little buddy. It is in between the little buddy and big buddy. I have one I use when I'm using my popup camper late in the year. A lot better than running the furnace in the camper.

1038229,David Chong,2018-12-23 12:41:00,836,Great deal! I bought one last year at the same sale price and I already have one! LOL
