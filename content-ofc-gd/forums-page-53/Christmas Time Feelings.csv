Rick and Dianne."

1038188,captpierre,2018-12-22 14:36:00,2521,"Very fine words, JoePa.  Sorry  about the loss of your wife and the emptiness you feel this time of year. It’s a tough time of year for  lots of folks that don’t have close family to gather with. Lets do our best to reach out to those in our circles that need some love. Merry Christmas"
1038359,pics,2018-12-27 17:23:00,1268,The loss of a loved one is really tough the first year without them. Too many of my friends have lost family members this year. I have a friend who died in an Atv crash and she left a 5 year old daughter and an old friend lost her 14 year old to suicide recently.. I was scheduled to work on the 24th and 25th nights but I was fortunate enough to have the seniority to take vacation days.. I missed the chance to make the big bucks on Christmas day but money means nothing if you miss too many of them with your loved ones..
1038360,Fisherman,2018-12-27 18:13:00,7201,"You said it well,  unfortunately I lost another good friend last friday to cancer, I was lucky to see him before he passed away.  Money doesn't buy memories and when they're gone, it's final.  Cheers to all."
1038366,lew,2018-12-27 19:01:00,12766,My son was killed 12 days before Christmas back in '04 and Christmas has never really been the same since then. The pain diminishes but never really goes away.
1038385,Loonietoon,2018-12-28 02:55:00,1450,"I know how it is Lew. Diane died 7yrs ago Jan 16th, 2012 and if it was not for my kids l would have lost it all together. Cancer is a terrible thing for anyone to go through. Lost my mother 6 months 5 days and 7hrs later. Christmas is never the same."
1038390,Beans,2018-12-28 13:18:00,3339,Jackie (Nanook's wife) was saying the same thing last time I heard from her...It will be 8 years since we lost Jack tomorrow...
1038391,lew,2018-12-28 13:27:00,12766,"Hard to believe it's been 8 years already Norm, Jack was a good guy. "
1038530,bigbuck,2018-12-31 12:37:00,2449,"Merry Christmas. This year was tough at our house too, we lost my dad in the late spring and it wasn't the same without him. Christmas is about spending time with family and remembering those that have left us."
