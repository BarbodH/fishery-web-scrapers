1038270,misfish,2018-12-24 21:32:00,29133,"I woke up early this morning and had this tingling feeling in my toes. It almost felt like I had happy feet. I got up, grabbed the waders and tied bags from a month ago , and decided to go  for a walk with pole in hand.  I knew the water was going to be high and cold, but a walk on this day was what I must do. I sat looking at 0 degree temp on the dash. Open the window and no breeze to be felt. I make the walk from the truck ,down a  fresh snow covered path. Not a single print from human or animal. Once I got close to the waters, I start to see hoof prints. Santas reindeer ? The sound of silence is through out the bush. Not a single peep from a bird,a hoot from an owl, not even a branch quiver from a squirrel. Very strange I thought. I get to my spot and the water is as expected. High, but the color is to my liking. I sit for a bit,having a sip of my java,assemble my pole and reach for my bait. In a distance I hear a faint whistling sound. Then all of a sudden,there was a flock of about 12 or so whistlers. They fly over head at such a speed. Behind them, another flock and then another. Then silence again. I start my quest to cast and to try and  hook up. This went on for an hour without a single hit. As I am scanning the area down the river a bit,I see a wake coming my way along the shore line.  By the looks of it,I could see it was something of great size. I paused my drifting, stood still and waited for it to approach nearer and nearer. I knew what it had to be and did not want to scare it off. As it swam nearer and nearer,I could see the large black form. It was only feet from me when it came up. Yes,mr/mrs beaver was making it,s way. He/she surfaced right in front of me. He/she, just held there in the current still like. I didn't move. The moment was so surreal. The beaver stayed in front of me for what seemed like minutes. I took in the moment we had and it was time to say farewell.  Off the beaver went, further up the river. With that wonderful thing behind me, it was time to start drifting again. Trying different presentations throughout my morning, I was still not able to hook up. Not even a swing and  miss. As if I was done with nature, I was greeted by a loud mouth chirpy chipmunk . You would think I was fishing his hole the way he was blasting me. After about 5 or so minutes of him running up and down a pine tree, yapping and yapping at me, he went on his way. Thank goodness, as he was disturbing my peace and quiet. Getting to the point of thinking it,s home time, I hear a snap. I'm like, ok ,whats this. I stood like a statue. Then a snap again. With the snow on the ground,it was hard to tell what was. I swivel my head very slowly in the direction of the sound and there they were. 2 young deer. These might of been the same ones I seen in October, but who knows. They came from the same direction as before. I stood still,and waited. As before, they came down,drank from the rivers edge. They looked my way, but never seemed to think I was danger. After about 5 minutes drinking and a bit of nibbling on tree limbs , they walked away from me and crossed the river. Same as they did before. They got out of the water,shock like a dog would do,and they were gone. Never once did they raise their tails as an alert sign. After a few more drifts and no hooking up still, it was time to pack up and call it a morning. I did not hook up this morning with a fish, but I did hook up with nature .Being one that enjoys the sport of hunting, it was very appreciating to have been graced with the presents of wildlife,while just being out there enjoying this fantastic morning.  The word I'm looking for I think is ?   APPRECIATIVE."
1038271,lew,2018-12-24 21:46:00,12766,Best story I've read in a long time bud !!
1038272,spincast,2018-12-24 22:05:00,3279,"its been so over used as to have lost its meaning - but we used to call that awe. An overpowering feeling that speaks to the soul. Great story. I love those moments. They provide a cache of the mystery of life we can touch when we need it the most Merry Christmas.  (and not to distract from the great story, yes, the loss of birds has become disturbingly noticeable in the last  few years. )"
1038273,Terry,2018-12-24 22:24:00,14456,Good story  But what no pictures of the birds and beaver and chipmunk and deer. Oh my Lol
1038274,Fisherman,2018-12-24 22:34:00,7201,"Ya, sometimes it's just worth it to see nature going by."
1038275,crappieperchhunter,2018-12-24 22:44:00,2582,No fish....what a waste of time? Just kidding Brian. Those type of days are the best and the reason many of us get out of bed at ungodly hours to spend time outdoors.
1038281,Beans,2018-12-25 14:01:00,3339,Nice post Brian... It shows to go you that there is more to fishing than catching a fish...
1038285,GBW,2018-12-25 15:12:00,8460,Damn chipmunks...    You had a better day than I did...  Merry Christmas Mr B
1038286,ketchenany,2018-12-25 15:13:00,3229,"Thank god you didn’t catch a fish, that story would have gone for another 1/2 hour! You are lucky that the beaver didn’t slap his tail. The day is over when that happens.  Food reading B"
1038291,misfish,2018-12-25 17:05:00,29133,"This morning I had the camera at the ready, and not a single critter came by. Go figure. LOL"
1038303,Rizzo,2018-12-26 03:03:00,4754,Whenever I go fishing and catch nothing my family thinks I am wasting my time...I should have them read your story. Sums up really well how catching fish is often just a bonus
1038320,akaShag,2018-12-26 17:55:00,2073,Thanks for the read. The word that comes to mind is:  spiritual Merry Christmas bud. Doug
1038322,misfish,2018-12-26 18:05:00,29133,I was leaning towards that Doug.
1038323,misfish,2018-12-26 18:07:00,29133,Do they eat Musky Rog ?
1038387,Moosebunk,2018-12-28 03:41:00,3970,"If you gotta have a time out fishing with no fish, you want it to be a time just like that one. :)"
1038417,Rattletrap2,2018-12-29 01:04:00,1652,"I'm kinda thinking like Shag (Doug)......spiritual is a good word to describe it, but appreciative works too! Great story B! Hope you had a great holiday season with the family! Brian"
1038431,Old Ironmaker,2018-12-29 16:22:00,8243,"Great tale. It's a keeper. There's a word, keeper. Cause you will be telling it for a long time."
1038447,CK88,2018-12-29 20:05:00,1,"Great story, and well told. My best fishing buddy and I have a word we have been using lately: Grateful. I have been writing it on my wrist when I get to my desk each morning. It helps me to remember how truly blessed I am; to have a good job, family AND be able to fish with good friends. All the best to everyone!"
1038470,SirCranksalot,2018-12-29 22:00:00,3291,"And, like a good wine or a big fish story, it will get better with age!!? I think you had a Zen moment, which are a lot better than a seniors' moment!!"
