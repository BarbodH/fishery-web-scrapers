1038401,Jds63,2018-12-28 19:45:00,1365,"yeah Simon, i got the Yamaha Kodiak and want to use it on the back lakes this winter was looking at the GPS ram mounts for ATV's , saw some of your vids with ATV , I know you also use your sled a lot so was wondering if you had any special accessories for your ATV that are designed more for winter ice travel"
1038402,Fisherman,2018-12-28 20:37:00,7201,A pair of these for sure. https://www.amazon.ca/Heat-Demon-215048-Clamp-Heated/dp/B00SJX4U8I   A good quality windshield is also recommended for those brutal windy days.
1038404,rob v,2018-12-28 20:50:00,535,great video - thanks for sharing.   now i'm hungry !! 
1038424,limeyangler,2018-12-29 12:15:00,5204,"I agree, I had those installed when i purchased my quad, considering I have no windshield they are essential!   Fish fries rule!"
