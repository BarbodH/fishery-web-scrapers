1038410,boombap,2018-12-29 00:10:00,310,"Honestly man, these day's it's hard to go wrong with either Humminbird or Lowrance.. especially when comparing the lower end units like you mentioned. If your just looking for a simple graph with some extra options it's hard to beat what you have picked out. A lot of guys will argue this like it's chevy vs ford vs mopar in the 70's.. brand loyalty means nothing nowadays and all units have ups and downs. For the money this is hard to beat https://www.cabelas.ca/product/107619?productVariantId=298593&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAsJfhBRCaARIsAO68ZM7YxfmaUjvC06a8537HlWtnLEA_Qdw43Y5sufSgR5WdoKpRHtwaK00aAsosEALw_wcB"
1038411,misfish,2018-12-29 00:12:00,29133,"Good to hear from you Rob. Long time  I have a saying about finders. KISS I have my 4x elite and 5x elite. Simple machines to use, once you figure them out. My new addition, bird 598 is a brain scratcher for me, but getting there. It,s got fancy things like di.si. GPS as well,  it is a nice feature. First for me. Always used land marks.LOL  Anyhoo, I know I was no help, but nice to see ya here."
1038418,tomkat,2018-12-29 02:37:00,246,I just bought a Lowrance as it was a very good sale price but all the newer models I looked at were very user friendly. The best thing to do is go to bass pro and play with all the ones in your price range. The guy I talked to there was very good and informative. I bought a Lowrance Elite I like the touchscreen and the price was right. GPS sonar combo with side imaging
1038421,Loonietoon,2018-12-29 03:47:00,1450,"Rob, Get a hold of Monty or Jos at Angling Outfitters in Woodstock... They will help you out a lot ...Best thing is free upgrades whenever needed and they know their stuff. Free Seminars in the Fall also. Tell them what you are looking for and they will help you. Hope this helps"
1038422,rob v,2018-12-29 04:06:00,535,thanks -  that's exactly what I've done -  and that will likely be where i purchase something.  just hoping to find someone who owns one of these units and get some firsthand intel
1038425,b2kptbo,2018-12-29 12:17:00,1505,Had the HOOK4 with Navionics (2017) easy to use and I liked it...
1038428,Garnet,2018-12-29 15:19:00,2056,"Took my buddy to Angler Outfitters when looking for fish finder. My buddy said to Monty ""I cant decide weather to buy 7 or 9. Monty walked over turned the 7 on and turn 9 on. Pretty funny and we all know what happened."
1038434,Old Ironmaker,2018-12-29 16:44:00,8243,Great info for you above. All I can add is get the largest screen in the budget.
1038437,rob v,2018-12-29 18:17:00,535,I assume the 9 was purchased ? 
1038448,Garnet,2018-12-29 20:18:00,2056,You assume correctly.
1038478,tomkat,2018-12-30 01:21:00,246,Shop around they couldn’t come close to the price I got on elite 9 totalscan.
1038482,misfish,2018-12-30 01:59:00,29133,"I wonder how the guys like I, are making out, using lesser $ finders are doing?  Are they further behind ?  NOT  "
1038484,tomkat,2018-12-30 02:09:00,246,Sometimes it’s worth it to spend a bit more for certain things. A large screen on a sonar gps combo is nice to have especially when your eyesight isn’t what it was lol!
1038485,misfish,2018-12-30 02:37:00,29133,"True dat. Other then that, show bottom,fish, Im good.Work the rest."
1038487,tomkat,2018-12-30 03:30:00,246,Looking forward to trying side scan never tried it before
1038488,bobowski,2018-12-30 04:48:00,360,I have used the Elite 5x for a couple of years. It has worked great for me.
1038523,porkpie,2018-12-31 02:53:00,2521,"If you fish Erie, use it to mark walleye schools off the side (they will show up) mark waypoint and troll over them at targeted depth.  It’s unreal!"
1038556,tomkat,2019-01-01 00:41:00,246,That sounds good I thought it would be good for marking structure while I am trolling. Hopefully find some spots and create some routes
1038580,Old Ironmaker,2019-01-01 15:25:00,8243,"And I have been told side scan is useless here on Erie. Why wouldn't it be useful here? Especially with planners. Now I know who is full of it, again. I will be in the market this year for new electronics after I heal up. I'll will be going strait to Woodstock. I have talked to Jos a few times and he knows his stuff and doesn't make you feel like an idiot like some places do."
