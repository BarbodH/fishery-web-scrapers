1038622,TJQ,2019-01-02 15:53:00,7806,I would have expected to see more minnow poop lol

After dark we heard noises on the porch, and there was a momma racoon and her litter fishing in the minnow bucket, they are a lot more skilled at catching them than your cat! Explorers? no idea how they knew there were fishing that bucket, but they had no problem getting the lid off."
