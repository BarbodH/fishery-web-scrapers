944446,chris.brock,2015-11-13 00:53:00,4053,"Picked up another Bravo long track , 93,last winter, it's been somewhat neglected by it's previous owner.  On the snow, under load, it would make an ugly clunk sound and it felt like somewhere along the transmission, skip or slip then hook up again.  I brought it home from the cottage, so I could look it over in the shelter of my garage. Everything I thought might be the problem looks fine, cogs, track tension, chain tension, chain gears, jack shaft, motor mounts etc.  I have an idea, but would like to hear some people chime in.  I miss Bernie being on here more often"
944447,Freshtrax,2015-11-13 01:17:00,2215,may want to service the clutches.

944451,Ksword,2015-11-13 01:35:00,40,I would look at track tension/drive sprockets condition - sounds like the sprockets maybe slipping. Edit - sorry..didn't fully read the part about you checking this...  Earlier post about secondary would be next on the list...
944456,Freshtrax,2015-11-13 02:01:00,2215,Also check the front trailing arm on the skid carefully make sure it's not cracked.

944469,fishnsled,2015-11-13 03:40:00,3520,"Jack shaft Bearings. Does the Speedometer still work?  I had this problem 2 seasons ago.  I was a light clunking as it would start out and then would be fine.  Last trip of the season and the speedo stopped working about 20k from the truck.  Service for last season was the bearings and shaft. drive belt, no goughing  I'll assume you have checked the belt but could be as simple as this."

I'm hoping u guys r right, because that's what I was thinking. The belt is worn but so was the belt on all my piece of crap sleds in the last 25 years.  any other input is appreciated"
944480,Freshtrax,2015-11-13 05:03:00,2215,Tear down the secondary clean and replace buttons.     If I remember they are a bit of a pain to get off on a bravo. Unlike most sleds they require a puller you can rent one at crappy tire for free.
944481,Sinker,2015-11-13 05:36:00,8692,Id change the belt before tearing apart the clutch.  I bet thats what it is. Our VKs at work are the same way when its time for a new belt.  A worn out belt can also mess up your clutch.  S.
944492,lakerguy,2015-11-13 12:08:00,224,is it a ratcheting noise you hear?  If so could be your drive cogs are slipping under load cause their worn maybe
944498,hutch4113,2015-11-13 13:21:00,374,"I had something similar on a Polaris.  When I would give it the beans, I would get a clunking/gear grinding sound.  Ended up taking it apart - issue was with the bearings on the drive shaft -  not that they were bad or anything, but there was a bracket that holds them to the chassis of the sled. The person who had ""worked"" on the machine the previous winter, had put the bracket only on one side - so nothing was stopping the bearings from shifting under load.  So when the torque hit - the bearings moved - which allowed the drive shaft to the track to move - which allowed the drive wheels on the track to move.  By the time I found it - it had actually started to eat a hole in the chassis.  Anyway - ended up replacing the bearings (had it apart so why not) - put the holding bracket on properly, with one piece on each side of the chassis to keep the bearings in the center.  Replaced the drive wheels (again - why not).  When back together it was a rocket, with no slipping."
944517,NAW,2015-11-13 14:20:00,4022,I didn't realize you could break a Bravo..  Weird.

Take belt off elevate sled and spin track by handnmake sure its free then work backwords from there"

944600,Freshtrax,2015-11-14 00:06:00,2215,There should be a trailing arm on the rear skid.   I broke mine on the bravo that's how I know. when I did the drive cog skipped. Under heavy load.
944959,simonl,2015-11-16 13:32:00,28,"If your speedometer isn't working that's a dead give away that the driveshaft bearings are done and ready to grenade themselves. Once the bearings start to fail, the driveshaft does not turn true and snaps the sacrificial drive pin that drives the speedo cable. I would bet the clunking you are hearing is the driveshaft flopping around under load. It is hard to feel play in it by moving it with your hands because track tension holds it in a fairly firm position at rest."
