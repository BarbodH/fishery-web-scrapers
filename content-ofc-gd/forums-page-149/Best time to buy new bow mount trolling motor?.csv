945003,bawbag,2015-11-16 19:46:00,48,Looking to upgrade my bow mount for next year. Just wondering what the best time is to buy. Do they go on sale in the winter/spring? Any where I should keep an eye on?
945028,Bondar,2015-11-16 23:41:00,817,Angling Outfitters in Woodstock will get you the best deal. If your going with Minnkota they usually have a $80 rebate for a few months of the year
945033,Dutch01,2015-11-17 00:52:00,1431,Spend $25.00 on a LeBaron membership and you get 10% off regular price. I got $175 off of my Terrova that way.
945035,G.mech,2015-11-17 01:19:00,830,Sail has 15% off sales quite regularly.  Their price on Minn Kota stuff is very competitive to begin with and when you save the extra 15 points you can't beat it. I shopped around all last winter and that was the best deal going including shopping in the US.
