945256,KraTToR,2015-11-18 18:53:00,506,Started packing the boat away today and I just can't do it!  There has to be at least one last trip to be had...  Was out on LSC for a spectacular day on Monday but the temp and wind forecast has me thinking that was the last big water day of the year..  I haven't fished for walleye since May so it would be nice to go out and try to find enough for a dinner.  Obvious choice is the Kawarthas.. being from Kitchener I don't want to drive much over 2 hours.  BOQ is just too far for a day trip..  Thoughts?
