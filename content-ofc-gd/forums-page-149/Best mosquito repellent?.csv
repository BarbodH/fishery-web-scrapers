From the Smithsonian:  http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/victorias-secret-perfume-works-great-mosquito-repellent-180957270/?no-ist  Anybody who comes home from a fishin' trip smelling like Victoria's Secret perfume deserves whatever he gets.
945032,aplumma,2015-11-17 00:51:00,6896,i am sticking to the deet 100.  Art
945046,Acountdeleted,2015-11-17 02:36:00,2562,This is an easy one. Watkins cream. Except no substitutions.  This is from 3 years tree planting in Hearst Ontario. The only thing that worked.  And you couldn't get me to trade it for a good bar of the same weight on some days.

And you couldn't get me to trade it for a good bar of the same weight on some days.  I agree with Jeremy, in fact I have 3 bottles in my cupboard in my washroom, You can find it at most Canadian Tires although it is under the name ""The great Outdoors"" now but Watkins is still on the label  Jeremy forgot to mention to get it in lotion form  "
945055,Rod Caster,2015-11-17 03:52:00,5784,"Well, I guess the secret is out now  For the record, Fall and winter are the best repellents"
945066,mike rousseau,2015-11-17 05:48:00,4661,A fellow tree planter eh...  I planted in fort Francis/ Kenora area...  And I agree... Watkins lotion was by far the best...
945067,manitoubass2,2015-11-17 06:26:00,11391,What?  And its fort frances lol
945072,bow slayer,2015-11-17 15:06:00,1074,"brand name is Combat,100% deet,a couple drops and nothing comes near you and I have tried Watkins,cant compare to the Combat."
945076,Garnet,2015-11-17 15:19:00,2056,I'm not wearing VS perfume at any fish or hunting camp.
945083,smitty55,2015-11-17 16:02:00,928,"brand name is Combat,100% deet,a couple drops and nothing comes near you and I have tried Watkins,cant compare to the Combat. I agree. Huge difference between 28% and 98% deet. I recently got 4 bottles from the states. Repel 100 and Maxi Deet. I'm good for a long time now. Just have to be careful around plastics with that stuff.  Cheers"
945085,manitoubass2,2015-11-17 16:23:00,11391,"There is a good reason deet works so well, its friggen toxic.  Might as give yourself a blast of agent orange while your at it?"
945088,dave524,2015-11-17 16:38:00,4508,"There is a good reason deet works so well, its friggen toxic.  Might as give yourself a blast of agent orange while your at it  As a kid we swore by stuff called 6-12 think it was made by Union Carbide, worked great until they found it caused birth defects and all sorts of nasty stuff. taken off the market."
945097,manitoubass2,2015-11-17 17:19:00,11391,Ah I think that might be the stuff I found in my grandpas old tackle box.  Did it come in a small glass jar?
945100,aplumma,2015-11-17 17:24:00,6896,Place deet anywhere except exposed skin. Works like a champ and you will not have to worry about how toxic it is.   Art

945102,manitoubass2,2015-11-17 17:26:00,11391,Yep thats the stuff!  Smelled horrid(mind you i dont know how long it was sitting in there? Im guessing late 50's early 60s)
945106,manitoubass2,2015-11-17 17:30:00,11391,"Thats better then directly on the skin but some WILL still reach the derma and penetrate.  A t shirt for example is just fabric, an amount of the spray will go right through it.  More will come as you sweat, say on a hot day."
945107,BillM,2015-11-17 17:41:00,17367,"I drink deet and just sweat it out, best way to protect against the bugs."

Im guessing late 50's early 60s)  that would be the time frame I used it, another that worked but don't see it mentioned much anymore was  "" Muskol "" think it was deet based."

945122,mike rousseau,2015-11-17 18:52:00,4661,Apparently you can make far from birch bark... It was on a documentary I watched...
945124,fishnsled,2015-11-17 19:01:00,3520,"Watkins has proven to be the best for the stable flies out on Lake O.  One application and good for the day where as the spray stuff was only good for a couple of hours, if that, at keeping them away.  Haven't used 100% DEET in years but it worked really well."
945135,Rod Caster,2015-11-17 20:12:00,5784,Cool. I'm going to look into that. My wife likes making all natural products and I like cutting trees
945202,bigugli,2015-11-18 01:18:00,6138,Just bring a mosquito magnet out on the water with you. You will be unmolested. The human mosquito magnet/sacrtifice gets all the unwanted attention.
