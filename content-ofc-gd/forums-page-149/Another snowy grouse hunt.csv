He got to shoot his bow a bit while we were gearing up at the start of the walk... the grouse have nothin' to fear from him for now, but we did come home with the same number of arrows.    He found a rib bone that some critter must have dragged away from a kill as we didn't see a single sign of anything else in the area. Shortly after my brother  got a grouse and our bird dog retrieved it...    ...and wouldn't let anybody else carry it the whole day.   At the end of the day we tried a group shot in the same spot where the bow and arrow photo was from.  "
