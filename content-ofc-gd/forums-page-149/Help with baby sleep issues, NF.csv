944013,SuperDave,2015-11-09 21:16:00,204,"I say welcome to parenthood. Been there done that with both my boys. 1st had chollic (sp?) and cried for hours. 2nd was breastfed and always hungry. didn't sleep through the night for 3 years I kid you not! Then when we decided to put them in the same room, they slept while we lied awake wondering when he would wake up! LOL!! I don't know who coined the phrase ""sleep like a baby"", but that person was wrong."
944017,manjo39,2015-11-09 21:40:00,354,"Hi Chris,  Read Dr. Ferber's  2006 edition of his book Solve Your Child's Sleep Problems.   Dr. Ferber explains a method of self-soothing and ""progressive waiting"" which encourages you to frequently comfort your child during the sleep training process.  There is some controversy about the method as people who oppose don't agree with letting your baby cry for any period of time.  There is also a lot of misconceptions.  It is at least worth a read (get it at the Library).  I learned a lot by reading it (even about my own sleeping pattern).  Good luck!"
944021,solopaddler,2015-11-09 22:09:00,8605," No need for that.  You're not the first who's suggested that, even if it was a joke...  There's maybe 8 people on this entire board I'd feel comfortable making that comment to without fear of reprisal. You are one.  Anyhow, yeah it was a joke, my apologies.  Now if you'll excuse me I'm babysitting my 2 year old nephew and he won't stop wailing. According to research from leading scientists who used orphan toddlers from Mongolia in a clinical trial, a tiny amount of cannabis oil added to the formula REALLY settles them down! I'm going to give it a shot."
944033,chris.brock,2015-11-09 23:46:00,4053,"This is cool, a baby advice thread may get locked, I like it!    Fidel, your rebuttal to Rick and Mike???     If you want some of the methods that our doula gave us, shoot me a PM and save yourself the money for useful things like a nice new ice auger or fish finder.  Too late, the money is gone. Very generous though, thanks.  If anyone reading this is considering a sleep consultant (doula), PM me, I'll just copy and paste you the whole program to you.  Someone else mentioned this, and I agree, the parents hire doulas because they get an actual person they can talk to, that will support them and hold their hand through the whole process.   Thanks everyone, we (my wife read all this too) learned a lot, but the feeling of being in the same boat and the positive comments are huge."
944035,misfish,2015-11-10 00:08:00,29133,"Well Chris I am only going to add this, as it,s been 33 years since we had our last one. Both boys were the same. Being new to parenting, we kust wanted to hold them and cuddle them when they would cry. We were told to let them cry. It,s was a, cry wolf sort a thing, attention thing, so we were told. I stood by it,but the mrs,s would go and pick up the child. It took a bit to get her to leave the boys to cry. After about 15 -20 minutes,the sound of silence was there. This is where I got nervous at times and would go to look in on them. A sneak peak in the room,listening for breathing, I could hear they were sound a sleep from a  wee snoring. Thats me boys. I dont remember how many times we went through this, but , it seemed to work well. I still caught myself checking in with them, but it all ended well.  There seems to be a common thing here. SUPPORT. That goes both ways.  Good luck bud."
944044,Rustic-Fisher,2015-11-10 00:49:00,826,"My kids are 5 and 2 , both were HELL during the night at that age, We did did everything you could imagine to remedy it ! Straight up ...........

944084,reelingMachine,2015-11-10 06:02:00,29,"Hi Chris.  We are at 6 month and 2 weeks now. No formula so far, only breast milk with some cereal and veggies. We do not want to push him to sleep entire night since breastfeeding at night stimulates milk production. Fed 2-3 times during the night in average, more often not long time ago  Just some small things we believe may help him to wake more often. We celebrated 6 month, wife ate some cake, man, what a night we had, crying after every 30min - do not mess up with sugar, avoid. Wife dreams when she can drink coffee again. But same with tea, if she drinks it in the evening - be ready for a worse sleep. Perhaps try tea with camomile around 6pm. With our older son who refused breastfeeding from the day 1 we gave him a bit of water during the night. Water is not good for the first few months but when cereal and veggies introduced it may be ok in small amounts. We think water may help stomach to rest at night while giving a feeling it is full, eventually brain sees no sense in waking up just for water  Make sure the room is not too chilly and well ventilated, he may just need to get warm."

Seriously though, as far as i'm concerned, there is no way to make a baby sleep (are boy is a savage) - I feel like those expensive sleep coaches 'work' because the child grows out of that habit - it will happen eventually with or without them. For us it was about 9 months of garbage sleep. the baby is now 1.5 and sleeps a solid 11-12 hours and gets himself back to sleep when he wakes up (90% of the time anyway).  Wish I had a better answer!"

944819,ch312,2015-11-15 12:28:00,1590,"Four pages of replies and not a single mention of teeth? Incoming teeth can turn the best little angel of a baby into a devil, especially if there are multiple teeth coming in. Our oldest is 2 1/2 years old and the baby is nearly 8 months. The exact same thing you're talking about happened with the first and is currently happening with the second. The only thing you can do about it is mommy and daddy need to nap during the day until you're out of this stage.  As for supplementing with cereals and formulas, nothing is better for baby than breast milk. The foods you're feeding could also be the culprit. I've never understood why some parents are in such a rush to get their kids eating food and it's almost as if some think it'll result in a bigger, better or smarter baby when it couldn't be farther from the truth. Many from across the pond will give nothing but breast milk for the first couple years.  Breast fed babies wake up more often during the night, especially while teething. Everything is normal and I would fire the sleep consultant.     I'm getting neutered in March. Now she's trying to convince me to get her knocked up before then....    "

944859,muddler,2015-11-15 17:40:00,623,"My son did that for about a year. Soft music (Puff the magic dragon was my favourite), a snuggle and many sleepless night for me worked most times. I found that a lot of active time with my son got him to sleep better at night most days. Sometimes a long ride in the 4 runner would work. Got stopped by the cops a few times at 3:00am, funny they all seemed to understand and sympathise with me. Wouldn't trade those times for a million bucks. Eventually buddy started to sleep through the night. At 17 (years) now I can't seen to get him up in the morning. Gonna try"" Puff the magic dragon"" in the mornings (lol).  I even enjoyed changing drapers. It would take about an hour and I usually was a mess afterwards. We'd giggle and laugh at everything for hours. Didn't get much done those days, but what a blast.  Enjoy every bit of the kid as he grows. Before you know it there grown up and gone. It's not such  a big deal, part of parenting.  Just my 2 cents.......muddler"
943958,OhioFisherman,2015-11-09 13:11:00,6623,"Had the same issue with my daughter, although not quite as often as you per night. On a regular visit to the family doctor she said to start feeding cereal just before bed. She said baby was waking up hungry...and cereal keeps the belly full much longer than breastmilk or formula. It worked like a charm. Six hours of sleep almost instantly!! She was 8 months old as well....so chances are your son will tolerate it just fine.  As I recall we did the same thing, they just were hungry. We started giving ours baby food on the advice from our doctor at a younger age than normal.    Puppies might help? LOL"
943962,Sinker,2015-11-09 13:43:00,8692,"We did the cereal before bed trick. Worked for my daughter, but my son, who is now 13, still doesnt like to sleep at night lol  Support your wife. She needs it.  S."
943963,Lape0019,2015-11-09 13:46:00,647,"I've got two at home. one is 9 and the other is 4.  The 9 year old was sleeping through his nights at 6 months only after switching to formula. The wife wasn't producing enough milk. Once we started formula feeding, it was great to finally get a full night of sleep. I was also harder on the wife when it came to going to check on him. We knew he was not hungry and he didn't need anything from us. Worst case, I would go in, put the blanket back on and stick a soother in his mouth, turn on his fisher price mobile (Little fish thing with water in it attached to the rail of the crib) and walk out. He would be back out in 5 minutes. He also learned to turn that thing on himself around 11 months.  The 4 year old was a different story. We switched to formula at 3 months but this little girl did not sleep through the night until she was 2.5 years old. The only difference I can see is that I let the wife coddle her a lot more.  So in the end, I would have to agree this is more of a comfort thing than anything else. nut know every child is different and although some of our suggestions worked for us, they may not work for you.  My advice, let the kid cry it out for 5-10 minutes. It should be long enough to know that no one is coming yet short enough to know if something is wrong.  Good luck! I surely do not miss those days but it does get better."
943966,Headhunter,2015-11-09 14:25:00,5703,"Here's what worked for us. I would do the last feeding in the evening, sending my wife to bed before the baby went down. I would feed the baby formula, which every doctor will tell you lasts longer then breast milk. Mom and baby would sleep until 2-3 am, breast fed and back down until 7:00am. Crying is excellent for lung development and should not be overly discouraged. Based on the OP, it sounds to me like that baby is waking up hungry. HH"
943969,Gallie,2015-11-09 14:33:00,1215,"I feel your pain chris, my girl is around 13 1/2 months old now and the last month has been rough, she had troubles around the 8-9 month mark as well but the switch to formula fixed that. At this point shes in a transition where she is re learning how to go back to sleep, we used to just walk in and give her the soother back and down she went, now she wakes up at 930 every night and refuses to go back to sleep. We have tried everyrhing with no succesfull pattern emerging. Last night she was up at 930, finally asleep again at 1200 and then awake at 200-400. Just ridiculous lol. If this persists after trying the extra feeding or the switch to formula the best bet is to talk to the pediatrician or the family doctor for help. Hope this helps a bit, you are not alone lol Sweet dreams"
943970,Headhunter,2015-11-09 14:45:00,5703,Another thought... don't let the baby sleep too long during the afternoon nap. Hour to hour and a half max. Just enough to take off the edge. HH
943971,Gallie,2015-11-09 14:47:00,1215,"I wanted too add, we bought a video monitor from walmart for around 120 and it is very useful in determining when and if we should go into the babies room, if shes laying down and cries a bit she will usually go back to sleep. If she gets up to standing in the crib to scream we go in right away. It does make a difference when you can see what shes doing when shes crying."
943972,jimmer,2015-11-09 14:56:00,2730,"My wife and I went through this with our son. We seemed to be up every couple of hours. Our pediatrician said that if he had a full belly that we should ignore and he would go back to sleep. We covered our heads with a pillow and listened to him cry for over an hour. It was the hardest thing we ever did, but he went back to sleep and the crying was less frequent every time he woke, until he was finally sleeping through the night. It took a couple of days, but we were finally over the up every 2 hour shift."
943976,grimsbylander,2015-11-09 15:26:00,3016,"Oh boy Chris, our first kid almost killed us! Here's the process we used and it was great. Feed him a small serving of cereal 30 mins before bedtime. Breastfeed right at bedtime, beside the crib so he'll learn what's coming next. Put him to bed, and walk away. Get an egg timer ready! As soon as the crying starts, set it for 5 mins. You need a timer because 5 mins of hearing your baby cry will feel like 2 friggin hours and you or you wife will go in after 1 or 2 mins. If he's still crying after 5 mins, go in with a cool washcloth. Don't pick him up! Just wipe his face, tuck him in and let him know you're still there. Then, walk away again. Get the egg timer ready! Chris, my son was up every damn hour for months and months. We did this and he slept through the third night! It's hard as hell to hear them cry but they are training YOU to come when they cry. My son threw up the first night! They have some serious stanima! Pick a time like a Friday night when you can tackle it without worrying about getting up the. Next day for work. Remember, he's not starving to death, he's teaching you to come when you're called! Good luck!!"
943977,cram,2015-11-09 15:29:00,1733,"Just keep doing what you're doing.  Every baby is different, and before you know it this stage will be over.  One idea though - you can pump breast milk and still use the bottle at night.  At the very worst you end up sharing the duties and giving your wife a break. Plus you're likely to get ""fuller"" milk into his belly (vs the more watery stuff he's getting if just taking 1 min sips here and there).  Plus, if it's more about soothing (which it sounds like it is), then a bottle is going to be less satisfying and he may grow out of caring about it as much."
943978,solopaddler,2015-11-09 15:31:00,8605,"Aye, but did ya include a wee dram of Scotch??"
943979,manitoubass2,2015-11-09 16:05:00,11391,The scotch is for daddy???  Fish oil and undenatured whey protein isolate will work wonders. Plus lil fisher will get extra immunoglobulins to enhance mommas milk. And the tryptophan will help regulate sleep cycles as it will produce extra melatonin production for both baby and mom
943981,Headhunter,2015-11-09 16:18:00,5703,A light touch with a rubber mallet will also work.... and doesn't leave a mark! LOL HH

With an upcoming family try coming up in a few months, we decided to invest in the services of a sleep doula and it worked.   but basically your paying someone hundreds of dollars to someone that is going to  to give you comfort that you are going to do the ferber method on your child.   she had several techniques on how to do it and it did seem to help.  simon only cried for maybe 5-10 minutes before falling back asleep.   by about a week, he's was sleeping through the night again.  If you want some of the methods that our doula gave us, shoot me a PM and save yourself the money for useful things like a nice new ice auger or fish finder."

943995,manitoubass2,2015-11-09 19:10:00,11391,"The most important thing is to share the responsibilty.  Yes its tiring at first. But with proper nutrition youll get used to it quick and wont need much sleep to perform anyhow.  If I can raise 6 kids, ages 5 through 14, work, fish, hunt, forage, cook, play hockey etc then you can do it as well.  Really need to look at proper nutrition and food as fuel.  I have my days too, im not a cyborg. But they are few and far between.  If I need rest the wife understands, and vice versa.  The biggest plus is my job(although long hours) is super easy.  Our quota is rediculous lol but i cant complain. I need 40 RTKs a day, I can do that in 3 or 4 hours. Then I sit in a truck and study/post on here lol"

943997,highdrifter,2015-11-09 19:27:00,2534,"Scotch?!  Jesus..  That method may have been common place in the past, but make no mistake, it's the last thing you want to give your baby.  The missus and I went through the same thing Chris..  There are two types of babies..  Those who are signalers and those who are self-soothers.  Some babies have the uncanny ability to sooth themselves straight from the get-go, and some need encouragement.  Ours was a signaller, and it was only when we had just about reached wits-end that we sought help..  Heck, being our first child, we just didn't know any better..  And the advice that I can give you is this..   Believe in your baby.  Don't loose patience and above-all, support your wife.  Be an observer, in a sense, learn your babie's cues.  Also, resist the urge to pick her up and comfort, nurse, what have you...  You can provide reassurance and comfort, make them feel that they are in a safe place.  I got into the habit of signing, adjusting my pitch to my boy's decibel level...  even a long, steady shooshing sound worked well.  You have to let them cry though, forget the notions of tough love.  Check up on them every once in while and stick to it!!  Lastly, don't lose hope.  It will get better.  cheers HD"

When our second was born I would have to hold Brenda back from always going to Leah every time she'd make even a little peep in the night.  Before long, 90% of the peeps and more just lead to one kid going back to sleep, and we'd learn to sleep right through most too.  Good luck bud.  There's no easy answer though for every parent.  You guys will surely do well regardless of how you handle things."

943933,mr blizzard,2015-11-09 01:53:00,1589,"Chris at the end of theday u will be fine, u and your wife survived the miracle of birth, u have won a lottery  trust me"
943935,manitoubass2,2015-11-09 02:09:00,11391,You know what my suggestions are Chris but this is pretty normal.  My first boy was exactly the same as yours.  We had to take shifts. I was young then and it exhausted us.  Every child after that was pretty easy
943936,Rod Caster,2015-11-09 02:21:00,5784,"We had same issue. At 7 months, my wife's mom came over and helped ""sleep train"" the baby into a 7-7 sleep schedule. Basically she just supported my wife and let the baby cry (a few more details I'm likely missing) . After 5 days she slept 7-7. Still does. The baby just wants mom and mom feels heartbroken to hear the baby cry. Nothing spectacular but still it's hard for a first time mom to just change things on a whim without someone knowledgable offering support, although getting a decent night sleep is the best reward, for both"
943937,Canuck,2015-11-09 02:23:00,491,"Our second never did sleep through the night and would wake up crying and colicky.  It was only when he was 3 or so we found out he has a lot of allergies including eggs (he outgrew that), and peanuts (that will be with him for life) and a bit of lactose intolerance.  The doctors said that mom's diet can impact the baby through breast milk.  We think that was the issue at the time.  If its any consolation, they all do eventually sleep through the night (until they are teenagers, and then the staying up all night starts all over again)"
943940,Roy,2015-11-09 02:41:00,13728,32 OZ per 24 hours? I'd say that's pretty good for a Ford.  He'll grow out of it Chris. Just be supportive of your wife.
943942,ccmtcanada,2015-11-09 02:46:00,7971,"Had the same issue with my daughter, although not quite as often as you per night.    On a regular visit to the family doctor she said to start feeding cereal just before bed.  She said baby was waking up hungry...and cereal keeps the belly full much longer than breastmilk or formula. It worked like a charm.  Six hours of sleep almost instantly!!  She was 8 months old as well....so chances are your son will tolerate it just fine."
943947,i2cool2fool,2015-11-09 04:03:00,349,"A lot of good advice and comments here especially from Roy.  I recall the same time period Chris. It was a tough age to parent and to have a clue of what to do as a first timer. I would never wake a sleeping baby but when my daughter woke up around 11 PM, I would load her up good with a 8 oz bottle of formula. We didn't breastfeed and it gave me a chance to help out. I am a good bottle man - for me and the kid! You may want to consider a pump/bottle approach and help with the feeding during the night on weekends, etc.  Your wife will love you even more if you are able to help out more in any way that helps her get more rest.  Good luck! We are all pulling for ya!"
943948,solopaddler,2015-11-09 04:13:00,8605,Pretty sure we had this exact conversation right after Jack was born. Find a good formula and fill him right up before bedtime.
943949,Gerritt,2015-11-09 04:19:00,6129,"Lol Roy, Crawford (Ford) only gets the bottle just before bed. Helps mom get about six hours of sleep. He's 16 months now, so he drinks it on his own now.... The first 9 months were tough though... I slept in the spare room (due to shift work) and Ford co-slept with Lyndsey.  Once he got on the bottle and filled up, life for her got a lot better..   Chris, not every baby is the same.... In only offering advice from my own personal experiences  G."
943950,bigugli,2015-11-09 04:28:00,6138,"My daughter is going through the same thing with 5 month old Savannah. On the breast, and she don't want the bottle.  Yes some of it is the comfort/security thing. grandaughter will only sleep 1/2 hour on her own in her crib before she is crying for mommy. She just has to let her cry a little longer each time."
943952,chris.brock,2015-11-09 12:05:00,4053,"Thanks everybody.  Mike,  we did try that without any results. Our pediatrician said that theory isn't true, can't remember his reasoning .I've heard others say it works for them though."
943954,alexmedic,2015-11-09 12:33:00,186,"Who ever invented the saying ""Sleeping like a baby"", should get a kick in teeth!  I remember the same thing when my youngest was that age.  It may not seem like it will end, but it will.  I would keep trying the bottle and that way both of you can share the responsibility a bit.  If you can swing it, hire a housekeeper once in awhile, to help your wife with the stress levels.  I remember your feeling.  The worse for me was the occasional feelings of resentment towards my baby, followed by extreme feelings of guilt for feeling that way.  Man, parenthood is a crazy ride.  That being said, I could never picture anything else!"
943955,adam lancia,2015-11-09 12:41:00,234,"We had to start bottle feeding our daughter very early on, she was only 3 weeks old. It actually helped her latch and has really made our life a lot easier, though we didn't know it would at that point. We would feed her cereal for dinner and give her either a bottle of formula when we put her down. She was able to hold the bottle herself at that age. That's what worked for us but our daughter has been a pretty good sleeper so your mileage may vary. When she was going through a tough sleeping period, she was sleeping in our room and I had the bottle warmer and a small thermal bag with 2 bottles of breastmilk or formula (we stopped breast feeding when she was 4 months old) at my bedside. I would warm the bottle and feed her, allowing my wife to get some rest."
943957,wallyboss,2015-11-09 13:09:00,1095,"The problem we had with our first was that he was taking his nights for his days.   He'd sleep most of the day and be awake every hour or so at night.   Somebody told us to try an ""old Wives Tale""   When the baby gets up at night carefully take him and flip him backwards 3 times!!  Sounds stupid but it worked for our baby the very next night he slept from 10:00pm to  6:30am."
