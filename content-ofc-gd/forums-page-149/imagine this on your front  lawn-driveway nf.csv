On Friday, Bill Tyra and his son, Josh, captured two moose duking it out in the Goldenview Park subdivision in South Anchorage.  My son and I had front row seats, says Tyra, who first captured the video above from behind a vehicle then moved to a nearby ledge.  The rut, the season for moose mating, begins at the end of summer and peaks in early autumn.  Behaviors emerge that have been dormant for the past year as moose engage in rituals related solely to reproduction, according to the National Park Service. Their uneventful lives quickly become hectic as bulls compete for breeding rights and cows seek out mating overtures from bulls.  In Tyras video, the two moose duke it out from one side of the street to the other, before eventually going their separate ways.  NPS says the bull moose are well-equipped to fight and during the rut, the neck muscles of bull moose expand to twice their normal size"

They will scrap anything that moves, including the swingset that one appears to have stuck in its antlers lol...  My pops once nearly got in scrap with one in his pickup!"
944547,Beavertail,2015-11-13 18:37:00,331,"Cool video. I don't like birds crapping on my vehicle, couldn't imagine those two brutes wrestling in the driveway!"
944552,NAW,2015-11-13 19:25:00,4022,That's wild!!!
944562,misfish,2015-11-13 21:25:00,29133,Cool  Not sure if that was a take down or slip. LOL
944565,DRIFTER_016,2015-11-13 21:49:00,10439,"MEH!!! Just a couple of moose dancing. No big deal. You see that kind of thing a lot in AK.  This is much more dangerous than a pair of rutting bucks in your driveway. A grizzly bear killing a moose in your driveway!!!!  Imagine trying to explain that one to the boss.  ""Uh, hello boss. I'm going to be late to work. I don't know how late, a grizz just took down a moose on my driveway!!!""  "
944567,misfish,2015-11-13 21:59:00,29133,"Dave, I can see a freezer full of moose and bear there.LOL"
944569,LostAnotherOne,2015-11-13 22:35:00,956,Nothing beats a good scrap.
944571,leaf4,2015-11-13 22:43:00,2466,"Lol I wonder what happened with the rest of the moose, would that be fit for consumption seeing as the bear only had a snack? Haha that would be weird"
944573,LostAnotherOne,2015-11-13 22:50:00,956,Grizzlies are the worst.  They don't know the meaning of a quick kill.  Just ask Timothy Treadwell.
944694,captpierre,2015-11-14 18:05:00,2521,That's unbelievable! Who needs TV? How the heck did it end up happening at a home. Was the moose seeking refuge near humans? Brutal end for the moose. I guess they all end that way sooner or later.
944886,DRIFTER_016,2015-11-15 22:43:00,10439,"That's unbelievable! Who needs TV? How the heck did it end up happening at a home. Was the moose seeking refuge near humans? Brutal end for the moose. I guess they all end that way sooner or later.  There are moose and bear everywhere in Alaska. Every spring in Anchorage cow moose come down out of the hill to calve in peoples yards because it's ""safe"". A lot of the time the bears follow them to snack on the mooselets!!! Every year there are bear maulings in and around Anchorage.  Moose also feed on peoples trees and flower gardens. In the fall they will even come up on your porch and eat your jack-o-lanterns.  This video was taken in down town Anchorage.    "
944887,DRIFTER_016,2015-11-15 22:53:00,10439,Moose in by buddies front yard this morning in Anchorage.  
944907,captpierre,2015-11-16 00:07:00,2521,Cool. So are there too many  for the hunters to take? Everybody has  their freezers full?
944911,DRIFTER_016,2015-11-16 00:26:00,10439,Cool. So are there too many for the hunters to take? Everybody has their freezers full?  They have very strict rules for the hunt. They don't allow cow or calves and the bulls must be of a certain size to harvest them.
