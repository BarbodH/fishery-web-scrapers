945131,lookinforwalleye,2015-11-17 19:49:00,4399,That would be 36 MPG....me thinks your Ram fuel economy thingamajig is messed up a tad...
945134,Terry,2015-11-17 20:09:00,14456,my 4x4  v6 ram is close to that when i drive with a light foot   (which is almost never)  but my wife gets that kind of mileage when she drives my truck
945147,Dutch01,2015-11-17 20:58:00,1431,"No one in particular.... wait were you talking to me or the ""other"" Dutch??  I'm confused  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
945164,KLINKER,2015-11-17 22:58:00,256,"So whats the top speed , somewhere around 400kh?"
945297,Fisherman,2015-11-18 22:57:00,7201,"So you want hand calculated mileage.  2004 Ram 5.9 6 spd stick 4x4,   157,761 km, 20496.87 liters, works out to 20.96 imp mpg.  I suppose if I drove more highway, I'd easily break 22-23 mpg."
944864,misfish,2015-11-15 19:32:00,29133,"I keep boasting about the great fuel consumption Im getting,and today I decided to show instead of just talk.  Im not a heavy foot guy. I will put it just above the limit and keep it there. I see no need to be speeding everywhere. I get up early enough to get to where Im going and arrive in time anyways. If I need to get up and go, the 3.6 gets going .  RPM,s are so low with the 8 speed tranny. 1200/1250 rpm at 83kph.       Sure beats the crap out of the F150 I had.      "
944870,Fisherman,2015-11-15 20:31:00,7201,"That's pretty good, amazing what an 8 spd will do for mileage."
944872,FloatnFly,2015-11-15 20:48:00,1640,"my needle sits like that too when i take my foot off the gas.  but seriously, my f-150 sits around 1500-1600 rpm at 80km"
944875,BillM,2015-11-15 21:23:00,17367,Got 21mpg US out of the oldmans Duramax on our trip out to Brockville last week.  Funny what not pulling a boat will do for mileage

944895,Joeytier,2015-11-15 23:15:00,3990,"That's good mileage.  Small, low 2wd trucks driven easy will usually get quite good mileage.  My 02 v6 tundra used to get over 20 on the highway."
944916,Fisherman,2015-11-16 01:17:00,7201,I could put your tundra in my my box and still get over 20.  Toyotas have to have the lousiest mileage of any pick up.
944918,Joeytier,2015-11-16 01:21:00,3990,"The Titans are probably even worse.  That Tundra blew up years ago, my Sierra is substantially worse"
944922,chris.brock,2015-11-16 01:32:00,4053,"What truck, Dakota or Ram 1500?  That's almost 29 mpg.  Come on Bri, you reset it and coasted down a hill. My wife's  Fiesta averages 33."
944923,irishfield,2015-11-16 01:34:00,26272,I think his computer has a malfucktion myself!
944937,Dave Bailey,2015-11-16 03:38:00,1641,"Couple of weeks ago I was pulled over on the 401 by OPP. He said a trucker had wanted him to see if I was okay to drive. Reason? I was the only one doing dead on 100km/h. I was well east of Toronto, traffic was light, and I stayed in the right-hand lane. No problem going around me if anyone wanted to. I told him I was on my way to Cornwall, and doing the same 120km/h as everyone else would suck a lot of gas. He agreed, and said have a nice day."
944939,leaf4,2015-11-16 03:47:00,2466,"Lo that's a new one.... Couple weeks ago I was driving to Ohio for a concert, in some pretty heavy rain around 9am we were coming through Pennsylvania somewhere on the way to some shopping place and some guy in a 04 camaro came ripping past us probably doing 130+ and then proceeded to veer in and out of the lanes and almost off the road entirely multiple times, he pulled over, stopped to pee and we passed him, then not 5 minutes later he's flying by us all around the road still and at this point we had called the cops and it seemed like we were bothering them with the call ""could he be tired?"" They asked even LOL"
944946,Skipper D,2015-11-16 05:31:00,1970,"Another good one on fuel , the 2001 2500 Ram V10 , you would never think it hearing V 10 but you have to try one to believe how efficient they are ."
944962,misfish,2015-11-16 13:54:00,29133,"It,s the Ram Chris. When I do my weekend trips,I always reset. Check on the numbers when I get to my local. Average 60-100 km one way.  Theres nothing flucked up Wayne.LOL"
944963,Dutch01,2015-11-16 14:08:00,1431,"My best 100km in my 2015 Silverado (5.3 V8) was 9.1 l/100km. Lifetime average over 18,000 km's is 15.4....I'm kinda heavy on the throttle though.  :\"
944972,lookinforwalleye,2015-11-16 15:31:00,4399,that`s his downhill MPG`s Wayne wait till he comes home uphill....
944973,BillM,2015-11-16 15:33:00,17367,"Hand calc your mileage over an entire tank, MFAs are usually extremely optimistic."
945048,Dutch,2015-11-17 02:52:00,831,"Not questioning the source of the info, just the measurement by the computer. Thats 28.685 mpg - there's just no way thats realistic."
945064,Dutch01,2015-11-17 05:16:00,1431,"The 9.1L I recorded over 100km was mostly downhill (not a joke), at 90kp/h on cruise control, at 3am with no traffic all the way home from the lake. Not exactly real world conditions, but it is possible."
945111,misfish,2015-11-17 18:08:00,29133,To whom are you referring to Dutch?Me?
945117,irishfield,2015-11-17 18:30:00,26272,"I think what the masses are saying Brian, fill the truck... go drive 100 or 200 km and see how many litres you can put into the tank again after the drive and do the math to see what the litres / 100 km says. While I'd love to believe that mileage I, as do others, suspect your flow meter is baffed and if so would get it fixed while under warrantee."

945123,fishnsled,2015-11-17 18:55:00,3520,"Funny what not pulling a boat will do for mileage You're telling me.  This weekend I towed the boat (empty - no seats, gear, trolling motor batteries or gas - it was just the hull, main motor and starting battery) 200k and it was 39L of fuel to fill it back up. (truck was empty as well)  The same 200k not towing coming back was only 22L.  It would be interesting to see what your hand calculated mileage is compared to the computer Brian.  Hopefully it's close as those are some awesome numbers."
945126,misfish,2015-11-17 19:09:00,29133,"See, now I understand. Thanks Wayne.  I did do a  trip this summer, Barrie to Gooderham and back. That time I was told by the computer, I got 7.8 /100. Terry was there as well.  I believe it is correct.  I,ll do the fill up thing and see what happens.  EDIT TO ADD  There is a economy thing I have switched on. Not sure if that makes a difference or not. At those low RPM,s I can see the great milage."
