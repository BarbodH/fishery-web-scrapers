945908,Fisherman,2015-11-22 12:41:00,7201,"Not so much accumulation last night coming back from Collingwood, but 3-4 inches of heavy slush will suck even the heaviest of pickups toward the ditch.  Quite the ride to say the least."

945284,4x4bassin,2015-11-18 21:58:00,1025,For those lucky or unlucky folks (depends on how you look at it) that are heading out this weekend to do a little fishing be aware that the Georgian Bay snow belts are expecting 15-30 cm of snow Friday -  Sunday . Special weather statements have just been issued for the Parry Sound area and down through Muskoka . The area will probably be expanding along with some weather warnings being issued in the next day . Be prepared for winter driving conditions in this area over the weekend .
945289,irishfield,2015-11-18 22:13:00,26272,"Why I cancelled Thursday and Friday fishing. Leah and I have been busting our butts, until we can't stand up, getting our firewood out of the bush and piled before it's lost in the mess. Figure we have two more 8 hour days, just to get everything that I have cut and split on the ground loaded / out of the bush and piled.  I'm just hoping they're very wrong...  .... just  looked at weather. It shows no accum for Friday, less than 1cm Sat and 1 to 3 on Sunday (for Midland anyhow!)"

Today it said ""a few clouds"" under current conditions. In fact, there was no blue sky visible nor had there been for several ours. If they can't get 'current conditions' right how are we to trust their forecast!!"

I have a bit of weather knowledge along with some friends in the "" industry""  some times these guys are wrong but most of the time they are always on top of weather events in the area . Having said that , some squalls for Friday and some system snow for Saturday followed by more squalls Saturday night into Sunday . Storm is still building on the west coast but should intensify as it moves east ."
945426,hutch4113,2015-11-19 21:07:00,374,"Guess the Canadian guys changed their minds?   From Environment Canada (only selected area around Barrie, but alerts so other spots in Ontario):  3:41 PM EST Thursday 19 November 2015Special weather statement in effect for: Local snow squall activity likely tonight into Friday just east of Georgian Bay. Snow heavy at times on tap for late Saturday into Sunday morning for Grey Bruce and Central Ontario. For regions just east of Georgian Bay: showers are forecast to change to flurries and local snow squalls late tonight into Friday morning as temperatures drop behind a cold front. Although significant accumulations are not expected at this time, heavy flurries and local blowing snow could reduce visibilities. Travellers should prepare for winter driving conditions.Snow squall watches may be required as the event draws nearer.For Grey Bruce and Central Ontario: a low pressure system developing over southern plain states of the United States is forecast to track northeast into Southwestern and Central Ontario. Current guidance indicates that the system could potentially give total snowfall amounts of 10 to 15 cm.There is still uncertainity in the intensity and track of the system and Environment Canada will continue to monitor the situation and update the statement.Please monitor the latest forecasts and warnings from Environment Canada at www.weather.gc.ca."
