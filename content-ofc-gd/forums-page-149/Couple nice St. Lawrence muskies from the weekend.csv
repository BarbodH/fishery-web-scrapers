944293,Fisherpete,2015-11-11 22:32:00,1814,"Headed out with Mike for another round on the Larry... first spot of the day, third cast in Mike lands a solid fish casting... Due to the wind we mainly trolled for the rest of the day, and I was rewarded with this beauty, my longest so far this year. Heavy, clean fish.  Thanks again Mike - can't wait until the next episode!  Pete      "
944304,DaveRoach,2015-11-11 23:09:00,202,"Wow great catch Pete, Mike....."
944305,captpierre,2015-11-11 23:16:00,2521,???
944306,irishfield,2015-11-11 23:17:00,26272,Nice guys!
944307,spincast,2015-11-11 23:22:00,3279,nice fish. You put a few miles in for that one
944311,chris.brock,2015-11-11 23:50:00,4053,"3rd cast eh, after that you guys probably thought you would catch another 15 for the day.  You guys don't toot your own horn but consistently put big fish in the boat."
944316,Fisherpete,2015-11-12 00:24:00,1814,"Rick - my trip odometer at the end of the day read 819 km... so yeah it's a bit of a trek lol... but well worth it. Chance at a true giant every time out, and Mike's a blast to fish with! He even knows where you can stop for world's best lasagna right on the water! Dave, Pierre, Wayne, Chris - thanks. And Chris - usually when you get bit that fast I find it to be a bad omen - it's happened tons of times to me that you catch one in the first spot of the day and then nada. Sometimes that sunrise bite is your best chance!"
944317,Rizzo,2015-11-12 00:29:00,4754,"Nicely done. I agree about the early success being killer on the rest of your day. Went to St. clair a few weeks ago, raised a fish maybe 3rd cast...didn't have a sniff the rest of the day. Worst part...as soon as I mentioned this to my buddy (how this often happens) it was on our mind the rest of the day...and it came true. Your 819 km is easier to take when some nice fish were boated"
944337,livinisfishin,2015-11-12 02:26:00,661,Sweet fish!
944340,moxie,2015-11-12 02:33:00,1566,Good to see fish posts. Nicely done guys.
944352,mike rousseau,2015-11-12 16:53:00,4661,"Thanks for making the drive down again Pete... Great guy to spend a day in the boat with...  To bad we couldn't run ""the monstrosity"" more... Lol...  Looking foreword to the next lasagna lunch with you... I might just have 1-2 more musky days in me before I start hunting big fall walleye..."
944353,manitoubass2,2015-11-12 16:57:00,11391,Awesome!!!
944354,lew,2015-11-12 17:00:00,12766,"If you get out that way again Pete have Mike take you for a Philly Cheese Steak, you won't need to eat again for a week LOL"
944360,AKRISONER,2015-11-12 17:21:00,5558,"s - usually when you get bit that fast I find it to be a bad omen - it's happened tons of times to me that you catch one in the first spot of the day and then nada. Sometimes that sunrise bite is your best chance!   Pete, im going to have to agree with your statement...as painful as it is, the scenario we ran together was much more enjoyable and rewarding (at least for me lol)  especially because i was 30 hours deep into the hunt by the time i got one.  It might be a bit more painful to catch one instantly and then have narry a nibble for the next 9 hours."
944365,msp,2015-11-12 17:30:00,1336,Nice fish guys ! Let me join you next time
944366,Fisherpete,2015-11-12 17:30:00,1814,Lew last summer when I was down there I knocked down the philly cheese log AND a big order of poutine with it... It hurt so good... A year plus later my ribcage has almost returned to it's original shape. Love being able to stop right on the water and grab a meal.  Pete
944370,Gallie,2015-11-12 17:35:00,1215,Nice skis boys! I cant wait to get out again myself i got 7 day streak to break...
944374,fishnsled,2015-11-12 17:46:00,3520,"A couple of very nice fish for your efforts, good stuff!"
944399,PBenson,2015-11-12 18:58:00,154,Nice job guys
944579,cowanjo,2015-11-13 23:25:00,249,"Pete is a great guy and works hard at musky fishing, he gets so many great looking fish and giants!"
944627,Dusky,2015-11-14 02:07:00,310,Nice fish!! For me  819 km should be a breeze for a fish like this
944986,Handlebarz,2015-11-16 16:35:00,3790,Nice going guys
