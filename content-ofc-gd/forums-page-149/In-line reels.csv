944658,Lukasaurus,2015-11-14 14:07:00,19,"Bought a Frabill 261 last year for perch fishing and just love it. You push the free spool button and your small perch jig free falls to the bottom, you have to stop the spool when you hit bottom or it will keep spinning and you have a mess on your hands. These are great reels, and no line twist. I picked up an Eagle Claw this year, looks to be the exact same reel with a different finish. Thinking about getting the Frabill 371 for lake trout, I love the free spool and no line twist."

944988,Fisherman,2015-11-16 17:16:00,7201,Can't remember the model I got but it has silky smooth release and the drag is fine too.  I'll add model when I get home. It's a #8 Cold Gear inline reel.
