945846,misfish,2015-11-22 00:00:00,29133,"I have only been there once,and did not fish. Was there on a visit to a OFC member. I did get to see the river. It is huge. Any tips on where to fish ( via pm of course) I would be very thankful."
945848,mitch seguin,2015-11-22 00:02:00,98,"http://www.cedarcourt.ca/reservations/  I have not stayed there; however, I have read good recommendations."
945853,SirCranksalot,2015-11-22 00:38:00,3291,"The only time I went I stayed at Huron Haven. Cheap, seemed clean, nothing fancy. Is there a Tim's in town? Is the pope Catholic?? Google maps will show you locations.  The only accessible place I know of is below Denney's dam. No need to say that on a PM. It's where everybody knows and goes to. I you want to get within 100 ft of the downstream boundary be ready for combat fishing.  There are prob more fish caught at the Geen than anywhere, but also more fishermen.  PM me if you need more detail."

No recommendations for accommodations unfortunately, it's within driving distance for me.  It is for me as well, just a 6 hour round trip. I would like to have a place to stay the night before and be on the river fresh. If the fishing is good,I would like to stay over night and do another days fish."
945871,solopaddler,2015-11-22 01:58:00,8605,Stay with Dave and I Brian. Duh!!
945872,misfish,2015-11-22 02:06:00,29133,"Stay with Dave and I Brian. Duh!!  I was just asking Mike. If it didnt work out, I was still going. Lots of water to fish on the way back home."
945893,MJL,2015-11-22 04:17:00,2427,"Brian, you could always just lay down beside the river. The sound of flowing water will soothe you to sleep  Doesn't get any closer to the river than that! First crack at the prime pools!"

945921,SirCranksalot,2015-11-22 14:56:00,3291,First crack at the prime pools!  Yep. And when you have to push the other guys away they are all downhill so you have the advantage. Maybe they'll all fall like dominoes!!

There wouldn't be docks were I am speaking of, we'd park and sleep right at the famous Legion Hole, one bridge above HWY.26, fish the waters of Beautiful Joe Park or upstream on the Bighead Conservation Area Land"
945945,misfish,2015-11-22 18:05:00,29133,"Me bad,missed that Legion thing. You still need to camp out there to get a spot. I seem to leave early in the am,but still dont get in.LOL  I was talking at the mouth area. 90% of them were steel workers back then. Theres now a outer break wall and the local says it has ruined the bottom of the river there. Too much silt setiment."
945950,ketchenany,2015-11-22 18:55:00,3229,"B, me too! Either at the Park or at the 'orchard'. Back then if you had the right vehicle you could take your chances and actually drive down to the river and camp, too muctch garbage and party crap stopp d that and a gate went up! nIce days. The last time I was there the walk down was great getting back up well not so great! Enjoy  the Geen, loved the river, it can get really cold with the wind coming up from the lake."
