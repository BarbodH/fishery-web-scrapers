As I'm heading to Ontario in a couple of weeks I may not get out until I return in January.  We are behind last season as far as ice production goes. The ElNino thing has kept us pretty toasty up here, well relatively.  Here is our local ice report from last weekend.    And the amount of ice we had last year at the same time.  "
945321,Gallie,2015-11-19 01:32:00,1215,"Awesome, hopefully you get out before you go!"
945329,solopaddler,2015-11-19 02:38:00,8605,Not awesome. Please leave it behind when you when you come to visit.
945335,DRIFTER_016,2015-11-19 03:50:00,10439,Not awesome. Please leave it behind when you when you come to visit.  I'll send it down after we have crushed a bunch of giant chromers Mike.

945549,mr blizzard,2015-11-20 13:57:00,1589,Dave I am going to punch some holes this weekend
945561,DRIFTER_016,2015-11-20 15:33:00,10439,Less charts more fish!  Wish I had time to drill holes. This weekend I have maintenance to do on my snow blower and I have to clean the inside of my truck for the drive to Ontario in 2 weeks. Next weekend I will do maintenance on my sled and trailer and maybe take a rip around on it. Then I have to finish cleaning the house and get gear ready for the trip. Doubt I will punch a hole until January 9th.
945563,Toronto_Angler,2015-11-20 15:42:00,698,You're driving down? That must be quite an adventure
945565,DRIFTER_016,2015-11-20 16:03:00,10439,"You're driving down? That must be quite an adventure  Yep, bringing the pup with me and have a bunch of stuff to pick up from Dad's place. He downsized again this year and has a few hundred #'s of tools for me to bring back here. Plus, they don't let the dog fly during the Christmas break and renting a car for a month would not be cheap."
945584,DRIFTER_016,2015-11-20 17:25:00,10439,Frosty today.
