945538,fishindevil,2015-11-20 09:58:00,6254,Not you Joey but there is many inconsiderate people who think that the local school yard is their dogs personal place to have their daily dump !!! Ya right where hundreds of kids play and win a kid falls in it they have to usually be sent home parents called and many times one of them must come home from work to get their kid !!!!!! It happens fairly often !!!! I know you would not do that at all but many do and they might be having a problem like that at that school but yes she obviously seen you on the sidewalk not on the school yard !!!! But yes she overreacted for sure !!! Glad ralphie is better !!!! Don't let it bother you too much      Shawn
945540,DanD,2015-11-20 11:52:00,2223,"Many people who work in an environment, where they have authority over others (like a teacher's over their students); forget that this authority ends with their students. They are so use to being in charge and obeyed without question; that they take this mentality with them everywhere, thinking they can order others about. This person who confronted you Joey, needs a reality check and you may be the person to give it to her! Something like a simple question; ""who in the hell do you think you are, ordering me about"" should be enough to clue her in?  Good news about Ralphie  Dan"

945543,Terry,2015-11-20 12:48:00,14456,so is the sidewalk school property  or town property
945555,Headhunter,2015-11-20 14:32:00,5703,"I'm not really clear on where you were Joey, but I can tell you that within the Toronto board, dogs are not allowed on school property, ever! Too many people as mentioned above, use school yards to walk their dogs and as we all know, not everyone is a ""good dog owner"". It's yet another example of the few messing it up for the many. If you were on school property, than the person who confronted you legally has the right ask you to leave. Even if you were cutting through to get to public property, you can be asked to leave. I hope this helps? HH"
945419,Joey,2015-11-19 20:55:00,9122,"So I'm walking Ralphie, one of our usual routes, down a street which leads to a community centre that has a parking lot that a school shares. There is a sidewalk.  I never go into the school yard, just stick to the sidewalk, then to the baseball park and down the path.  Been doing it for 4 years now.  Today, which apparently was ""kids get out of school time"" this woman comes up to me, a teacher I'm assuming, says ""Excuse me, we don't allow dogs on our property, and especially at this time.""  I said, I'm on the sidewalk and just walking to the park.  She told me to leave now.  I thought what nerve.  How is it ""her"" property.  Do I not pay school taxes etc.???  I left so angry I'm still fuming.  Okay, rant over."
945420,manitoubass2,2015-11-19 20:56:00,11391,"Sidewalk im assuming is fairgame.  Shake it off, not worth your frustration?"
945421,misfish,2015-11-19 20:56:00,29133,You should of dropped her J and just kept walking.
945428,Fisherman,2015-11-19 21:15:00,7201,"Sidewalks are on public property, I would go back, see the principal and then the school board to give her a dressing down."

945435,Rodbender,2015-11-19 21:28:00,1027,Ralphie c-o-c-k leg now
945436,Rodbender,2015-11-19 21:30:00,1027,You should of dropped her J and just kept walking. LOL
945437,Joey,2015-11-19 21:32:00,9122,"How's Ralphie doing now Joey, the eyesight still holding up ??   He's great Lew, thanks for asking.  Took him for a follow up eye exam and the pupils are dialating like they should be. He is seeing just like normal.  I'm so happy"

I'm so happy  That's such great news Joey considering only a couple weeks back they said his sight was gone for good.  Really happy for the little guy and looking forward to seeing him again in June."

I'm so happy  Im happy to hear this, but thought it was uncureable? If they can fix me,they can fix anything.  Still say you should of dropped her and kept walking. LOL"

LOL  Actually, the vet apologized and said ""sorry, wrong diagnosis.""  I may drop her, except I've taken my animals to her for the last 30 years.  I guess 1 wrong diagnosis may not be a reason to be hasty in dropping a vet you have trusted for years.  He had an ear infection that pushed on his optical nerve.  After 3 weeks of ear drops, his eyesight came back.  I'm just to happy about it I have to thank the Lord!"

We paid big$ for meds for him for what we were told was kennel cough. Each time she would  press on his thoat, he would gag. After a few days of watching him, we found him biteing at the dresser and eating the wood. Had a camera put down and yup, sliver of the wood in his throat. Stupid dog .  Giz is still giz here. He barks and dances around til we pay attention to him.  He really likes dry roasted peanuts. Not too many though. I need my fill..LOL"
945469,spincast,2015-11-19 23:23:00,3279,"glad to hear Ralphie is getting his sight back, that's great! As for the meeting with the twit.....  Hopefully she isn't helping form the way the next generation thinks."
945470,Ralph Field,2015-11-19 23:28:00,1018,Glad to hear your Ralphie has his sight back. Definitely talk to the principal unless it was the principal that approached you.

I'm so happy  That is wonderful news, so glad to hear it You should of dropped her J and just kept walking. You have way too much class for that! How about just walking by their again when the kids are getting out and if she tells you to leave again, give her one of your big beautiful smiles (you can throw in the one finger salute too if it makes you feel better  ) and tell her to call the cops then just keep walking!"
