944272,jimmer,2015-11-11 20:20:00,2730,Another Sudbury photo. This was my uncle Mike who I have been compared to in regards to being hooked on fishing. I never did get a chance to fish with him. He died young.

944277,manitoubass2,2015-11-11 21:08:00,11391,"Old photos are the best! Such a different time, and mentality like you mentioned.  I have a musky photo of my wifes grandpa ill try to find.  All my gramps photos are with my dad.  They had huge stringers. Before the roads were built they biked to spots and had a little tinny. They hammered em on just a hook and minnow"

945149,jimmer,2015-11-17 21:23:00,2730,This is one of me at Sturgeon Lake back in the 60's. The boat on the left is one my father built from scratch. 
945152,lew,2015-11-17 21:37:00,12766,"I've posted this picture a few times before but it's one of my favorites.  This is my dad fishing back in the 50's but I have no idea where it was taken.  That old baitcaster rig he's using is the rod & reel I learned to fish with and that's the boat I 1st learned how to drive.  Notice the steering wheel is on the left side of the boat and there's 2 levers for the controls, one to put the motor in gear and the other for throttle.  "
