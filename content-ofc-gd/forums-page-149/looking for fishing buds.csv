945270,Beans,2015-11-18 20:02:00,3339,I don't fish more than a couple of hours at a time now-a-days due to a bad back and legs... Ever since I had to scrap my twenty year old Ford 150 I use a cane and electric scooter to get down to the shoreline to wet a line... The place where I bought a mirror for the scooter gave me a homemade cane holder which I find holds my rods and flag quite nicely... It also doubles as a hitch for my steel garden wagon to haul my gear and chair...(I need to sit to cast and fish)...
