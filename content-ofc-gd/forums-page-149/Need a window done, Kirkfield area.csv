945811,GBW,2015-11-21 21:38:00,8460,"I need a window done at my sisters in Kirkfield and it's about 25.6 x 39 but she's not 100% sure on the 25.6 part but the 39 she's sure on. Been quoted already but I feel it's way to much. So, anyone able to help here? Full install done for the quote including any drywall work please PM me. May need a bit of siding to make it ""Purdy"" outside too..."
