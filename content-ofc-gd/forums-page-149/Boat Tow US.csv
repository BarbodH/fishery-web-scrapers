I know the company is US but the info about insurance and such is excellent for us Canooks too. This poor guy got screwed over twice in two years getting his boat towed because of breakdowns on the water.  http://chrisflintfishing.com/blog/caution-anglers-freshwater-pirates/#.Vkzv4xUuHmM.facebook

945367,KLINKER,2015-11-19 16:43:00,256,A power and sail squadron course could have saved this guy thousands and should be the first thing on his to do list.
945378,Big Cliff,2015-11-19 18:06:00,6899,Not that it affects me but it was well written and could save someone a pile of money!  Thanks for taking the time to post the article.

945414,DRIFTER_016,2015-11-19 20:42:00,10439,True. I would have used my TM to run around to the leeward side of the island.
945443,BillM,2015-11-19 21:46:00,17367,After reading that he doesn't seem very smart.
945445,aplumma,2015-11-19 21:52:00,6896,I have been a member of US boat for years and with their tow program and insurance policies they have protected me 100%. They also watch the government and advise on laws and their effects on the boaters of America.  Art
945471,landry,2015-11-19 23:34:00,1005,Bad decision to beach it. But he did get screwed.
