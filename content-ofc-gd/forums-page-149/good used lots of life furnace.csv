945782,lew,2015-11-21 14:16:00,12766,Paying for something over time is never the best option but if your without heat now it may be something to look into. No idea what the monthly costs would be but I'm sure a furnace company could work something out for you.  And with the proper type of furnace no chimney is neccesary.  Hope it all works out for you.
