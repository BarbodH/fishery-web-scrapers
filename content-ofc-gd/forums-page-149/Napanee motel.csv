945933,mike rousseau,2015-11-22 16:23:00,4661,Hello  Heading to quinte in the morning and looking for a hotel...  Last year we stayed at twin peaks but the parking lot was tight for a truck and boat...  Don't care about quality... Lower the price the better.... Just need 2 beds and a parking lot that'll handle a boat no problem...  Hoping to stay in Napanee cause we have options for what ramp we drove too  Thanks

945946,mike rousseau,2015-11-22 18:12:00,4661,I loved it there but if there is another boat or 2 booked we are screwed for parking...  Looking at the royal Napanee Inn... $69 a night across from the A&W/gas station just off the 401

946007,Lunkerhunter,2015-11-23 18:27:00,455,picton harbor inn isn't bad. its about 80 bucks a night I think.  merland park is  awesome if you want a cottage. a bit more expensive but cottages are nice and full amenities. boat launch and docks also  twin peaker is ok. lol is Ali still running it? that places gives me the shivers. hahah too many rough nights(partying) at that place for me.  ive also stayed at fox motor inn. its ok. similar prices as the twin peaker.
946022,Sinker,2015-11-23 20:56:00,8692,LOL....been there done that. Does it always smell like a leaky septic bed or is that just when I stay there? lol  S.
946046,mike rousseau,2015-11-24 00:18:00,4661,This royal is just what I was looking for...  Very happy  Thanks everyone
