941087,misfish,2015-10-22 15:54:00,29133,Seen that else where Paul.  Massive fish.
941088,AKRISONER,2015-10-22 16:01:00,5558,im guessing improved stricter regulations on fishing is allowing these fish to grow in size...  Keep the regulations tight!  Its a shame that this fish was killed for verification purposes. oh well.
941089,Acountdeleted,2015-10-22 16:07:00,2562,Wow. I gotta get to Michigan.  Agree with Arkansoner. I'd want that fish to spawn as much as possible.
941106,captpierre,2015-10-22 17:20:00,2521,Likely an old Broad and not much spawning going on anymore.
941109,Cloudy15,2015-10-22 17:40:00,141,"ya sad it was killed. Question tho, since it was 27.5 vs the old record of 24.5 was this fish even close to it's max weight?"
941114,Acountdeleted,2015-10-22 18:47:00,2562,I thought it was reverse. Previous record was 27.5 and this one was 24.5? Means it was a fat fish.
941118,LostAnotherOne,2015-10-22 19:01:00,956,Hopefully it was released.  Hate to see a pig like that kept.
941119,Dara,2015-10-22 19:13:00,3052,He was even in a Bass boat when he caught it

941156,OhioFisherman,2015-10-22 23:22:00,6623,"http://www.fieldandstream.com/blogs/field-notes/michigan-angler-lands-state-record-9-pound-smallmouth  Big fish, plenty of pictures and witnesses, I don't think I would have kept it for a mount.  "" He was even in a Bass boat when he caught it "" and fishing in a bass tournament!"
941209,Jigger,2015-10-23 10:32:00,1237,"According to Kathrin Schrouder, the fisheries biologist who confirmed the record catch, Gasicel plans on having the fish mounted. Had it not been a potential state record, [Gasicel]told me the fish would have been released unharmed, says Schrouder.  In this day and age, who gets a skin mount? Just silly IMO."
941211,Rizzo,2015-10-23 11:40:00,4754,Zoinks what a brute

Im not a believer of killing fish for mounting purposes with the replicas that are available these days. But!.... if its dying anyways for verification purposes, why not get a mount? What else do you think you should do, throw it in the trash?"
941237,Steve,2015-10-23 13:41:00,2075,"of course you get the skin mount, lol.  if your going to keep it, which I would have as well, record or no record, skin mount it is for me.if your keeping the fish (for whatever reason), don't waste it. Mount it, pay the good price for a good skin mount, and take care of it...it'll last decades as well....  another option is to get a replica made, but using the kept fish as the mold...that way it is an exact replica of your fish.  congrats to that anger...what a fish!"
946025,grimsbylander,2015-11-23 21:24:00,3016,"What a horse. If he was a tournament angler as it appears, he caught and released a lot fish over the weeks, months or years previously. If he was going to keep a fish, this was the one. Good for him!"
