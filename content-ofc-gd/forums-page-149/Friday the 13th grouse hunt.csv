944692,kickingfrog,2015-11-14 18:04:00,8333,Long road trip for a day of birds with my brother. Didn't see anyone else the whole day. My brother got 3 and I never pulled the trigger. That's grouse hunting.  Spruce grouse hen in his right hand.   Me just walkin' through the woods.     Last bird of the day while I was trying my luck off-trail.  That's the smirk of a little brother who has 3 birds to zero and got the last one whilst I was slugging through the think stuff.
