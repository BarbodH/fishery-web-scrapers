944671,bigugli,2015-11-14 16:34:00,6138,Went to market this morning and was greeted by snow in Kitchener at 6 in the morning. Of course the weather meatheads are assuring us that we should not be seeing any snow in the near future.
944672,lew,2015-11-14 16:43:00,12766,Just a light dusting up my way Bruce and it's all gone now but if that's all we get this winter I'm good with that LOL
944674,captpierre,2015-11-14 16:59:00,2521,How is St Jacobs these days. Haven't been there since the fire. Did they rebuild? Bigger?
944675,bigugli,2015-11-14 17:03:00,6138,How is St Jacobs these days. Haven't been there since the fire. Did they rebuild? Bigger? There is a plastic dome structure where the old building stood and a much bigger wooden structure on the east side just before the livestock yard.  We are certainly kept busy outside.

944686,Joeytier,2015-11-14 17:35:00,3990,"Back lakes around here were already skimming over this time last year, and we were drilling thru 5 inches on December 2.  Bet were gonna be at least 2 weeks behind this year, 4 days of 8-12 degree highs next week means the boat gets an extra lease on life."

Some are only showing 2-6 inches while others are hinting at more than a foot for some regions in Southwestern Ontario.gasp emoticonBlizzard like conditions are also possible late Saturday night and throughout the day on Sunday as the wind gusts could get pretty intense, even possibly reaching borderline severe. Brace yourselves, winter is coming.   "
