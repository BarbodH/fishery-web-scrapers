945379,Beavertail,2015-11-19 18:11:00,331,Haha! That's funny!! Here kitty kitty.... That video has to be a joke.

Ya i know made a copying mistake.HaHa  They are way out west....not many there either(1,000) but lots of videos, people whip out their smartphones faster out west. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeWM1eiWil4"
945381,Sinker,2015-11-19 18:22:00,8692,"The first one I saw was at Lingham lake. Pretty isolated for southern ON. The second one was about 15km from where this one was spotted. I live about 4km as the crow flies from this one, so it could have easily been the same cat.  Once you see that tail, there is no second guessing.....and yeah, gone like a ghost. No way your getting a photo.  S."
945382,glen,2015-11-19 18:27:00,2641,MNR.    Look silly with denial.  I wonder what else they hide.

945466,Whitespinnerbait,2015-11-19 22:51:00,2038,"Lol....Like just how many cougars are out there ?  A handful,Hundreds,Thousands ?  Yet no pics ?  Dead ones and still no photos taken, I'm sure the skeleton is still there!! RIGHT ???"
945475,manitoubass2,2015-11-19 23:44:00,11391," I would have loved to take photos, but like I said, no cell phone(this was roughly 14 years ago we had a dead one on the weigh scale), and AGAIN, good luck. If national geographic photographers came( or other pros) they would find them zero doubt in my mind.  Last thing I think of heading 90 km up cedar narrows road is ""i better have a camera ready to see an animal that jumps clearly across the road in one bound to photograph it""  Juveniles seems to be the easiest to catch with their curiousity.  Full grown good luck.  If you have deer in the area and other small game, im willing to bet cougars have been or are in the area.  Heck im sure many here have walked right past them."

Dead ones and still no photos taken, I'm sure the skeleton is still there!! RIGHT ??? Last confirmed cougar in Ontario was Creemore in 1897.  Watched all the youtube/smartphone videos and the western mountain lions aren't in any hurry to bolt. They seem to relaxed almost stalking, not taking off scared. They are apex predator.  Need pics/video please in this smartphone world."
945488,manitoubass2,2015-11-20 00:20:00,11391,"In the west the landscape is totally different and theyvebeen there for who knows how long?  Im assuming these factors make a difference, it is logical."
945574,ehg,2015-11-20 16:37:00,2666,"Lol....Like just how many cougars are out there ?  Since i have the time, i decided to research this cougar stuff a bit.  Seems possible that one or two male mountain lions have made it across the prairies looking for females.  And yes Manitoubass2 your area would be first safe area to hide in, if they made 1000 mile journey across gun infested American hunters etc...  There could be a couple of male lions, not many. Very interesting, scholarly Phd written article suggesting one or two (not many) even crossed through eastern Ontario. Well worth a read if interested. Need to read whole article.  Again a couple maybe made the traffic, gun infested guantlet. http://www.mountainlion.org/featurearticleeastwardho.asp"

944739,captpierre,2015-11-14 20:38:00,2521,"Sure looks like a cat to me, Lew. Not a dog tail that I've ever seen."
944742,manitoubass2,2015-11-14 20:40:00,11391,Looks like it to me as well but its either still young or sick. It appears to be pretty small

944747,irishfield,2015-11-14 21:02:00,26272,"That's the problem with these Cougars Chris, they always like to show off their best side!"
944748,manitoubass2,2015-11-14 21:09:00,11391,Out of the ones ive seen chris they are so fast in the wild you would never get a picture unless you were on some national geographic trip.  And once they hit the bush they are totally invisible  Im guessing soon well see some on trailcams
944752,Beavertail,2015-11-14 21:24:00,331,"That pic really is the ""cats a--"". Not a great shot but at least it has a long tail, is the right colour, and looks feline. Definitely not a dog. Comparing it to the size of the trailer tire, it does look quite small. If only you could see the head of the animal!"
944757,Sinker,2015-11-14 21:46:00,8692,"This is right in my neighbourhood. I hope I get to see it. It wouldnt be the first one I seen. I saw another one within 20km of this one, and im positive it was a cougar.  S."

944835,esoxansteel,2015-11-15 14:27:00,1307,"Ive seen 2 in Peterborough, one off Atckinson Road in a field, and the other toward Emily Park, quite possibly the same cat as they do have a large territory, a farmer in Downeyville by Omemee had one on a trail cam with one of his chickens in her mouth, as he told the MNR and they would not believe him so he put up a cam, and now they believe"
944847,Freshtrax,2015-11-15 16:02:00,2215,Wouldn't suprize me I saw one 2 min outside Kitchener crossing the frozen grand last winter.   Father in law has his fair share of cat stories from 65 years in the bush near  smiths falls
944948,fishindevil,2015-11-16 09:10:00,6254,"There have been several reliable sightings like someone mentioned above by farmers in the Kawartha lakes area especially by downeyville which is 10 mins away from me and another friend of mine who lives on his farm about 2 miles away had seen 1 a year ago as well and he knows what they look like as he shoots raccoons and coyotes and can as he had livestock and he swears he seen one and notifies all the farmers in the area but nobody reported it to the MNR as they are farmers and know the MNR is  mostly non- believing that they are around as to not panic the public there have also been a few deer carcasses found in some pretty unusual places ..... Places that a coyote or wolf would not have left it there ??? And we have them here as well as black bears too and with the crazy early hours I keep for work as well as fishing & sledding I hope I do catch a glimpse of one that would be so cool .... The old farmer says they were also seen back in the early 80""s in the same area and with the explosion in the turkey population and lots of deer he thinks that's why they are being seen again !!!! And he had had livestock of various times for almost 60yrs"
944952,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2015-11-16 09:37:00,535,"My mom and her neighbours saw two of them fighting each other right in her neighbour's driveway, in the Paudash area. It was too dark to get a photo of them but pretty distinguishable. This was....2-3 years ago? Her neighbour saw one again last year as well.  A woman I work with says she knows a farmer who shot one, can't say for sure if it's true. Apparently he told the MNR it was after his livestock, they refused to believe him/do anything about it. So he told them he was going to shoot it. They said he can't do that, so he asked them again if they'd come out there and do something about it. Nope. So he shot it and told them to come pick it up. She didn't say he was charged with anything."

Too small almost dog like. Cougars are Mountain LIONS.   You would think with everyone having a smartphone that a good real picture would show up.

They are super predators for a reason, if they dont wanna be seen, odds are you wont see them, and if you happen to see one, it isnt gonna be for long"

They are so fast youde never have time to bust out a camera.  Bush is just too thick here In NW ontario  Maybe in a mountaines region and a long lense but here its just not gonna happen.  Where did you see one sinker?  And im with ya, i seen them so i know. I dont care much if anyone believes me"
