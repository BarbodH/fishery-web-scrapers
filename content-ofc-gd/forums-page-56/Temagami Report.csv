1034568,LostAnotherOne,2018-09-30 18:28:00,956,Just got back Friday from our annual weeklong trip up to Temagami.  The wife and I rent a houseboat and head off the grid.  Snowed a little the first day.  Lots of rain too.  Temps were at 60 throughout the week.  All fish were released to live another day.  34 incher caught trolling shoreline in first hour. New PB  28 incher for her.  Nice battle 37 incher.  Love the feeling when it hits and you know its a bigger one.  21 incher.  She caught 5 walleye.  I caught 1 lol. 17 incher.  Little guy but caught using light action ice fishing rod.  41 incher.  Fish of the year for me.  Was fishing in 50 fow for smallies.  Using white tube jig with no leader lol.  Fishing gods were looking over me on this one.  
1034570,BillM,2018-09-30 18:47:00,17367,Those are some nice thick pike!   Good job man.  I love that initial hit then nothing but weight   You know you've got a biggun
1034582,chris.brock,2018-10-01 02:05:00,4053,"I like the initial hit and then the pike just casually swims off like my 20 lbs braid and arched rod don't exist, lol. It looks like a successful trip! Did you rent a houseboat and tow your fishin' machine? I'd love to try that."
1034584,LeXXington,2018-10-01 13:13:00,1928,looks like a successful trip ?
1034586,AKRISONER,2018-10-01 14:49:00,5558,"did you tow your fishing boat behind the houseboat? 50 FOW with a 41 inch pike...ahahaha i bet you had a few moments where you were thinking you were going to get spooled. Gotta love pike when you catch em  deep, they run and you sometimes think that they will never come back as the drag screams away lol."
1034589,LostAnotherOne,2018-10-01 16:48:00,956,"Thanks for the replys guys.  I do tow my 14 footer behind behind it.  Third year doing it and it gets me so pumped up every time.  I rent the houseboat through leisure houseboat rentals.  Great people who run it.  Just tie the houseboat up to shore or island for week then cruise around in your boat.  With rental, booze, food, gas its around 1500 for the week."

1034981,Woodsman,2018-10-09 22:42:00,1286,Did you get back to Cross Lake. Great area. We were there on Wed.
1035244,japper,2018-10-15 13:02:00,31,"Nice, I spend about 3 weeks a year on that lake, usually base out of Finlayson so fish mostly NE arm, houseboat idea sounds fun. Any lakers?"
1035271,LostAnotherOne,2018-10-15 20:28:00,956,"No lakers this year.  Tried, but no success.  Will be on next years report."
