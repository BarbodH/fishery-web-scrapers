1035069,DRIFTER_016,2018-10-11 01:07:00,10439,I got most of my lumber for my cabin through a smaller lumber yard here. Not too much choice as we have Home Hardware Building Center and the smaller guys Igloo Building Supplies. Probably didn't save a ton but the quality and customer service were worth it. You can check smaller lumber yards in your area and see what they are like.
