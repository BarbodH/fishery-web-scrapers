1035504,captpierre,2018-10-19 23:04:00,2521,I’m realizing how much warmer a cork handled rod is to hold in the cold weather.  Compared to a rubber/foam synthetic handle. Trolled for hours today. Without gloves there’s a big difference. You rod connoisseurs like know this already. New to me. Water is gin clear and 53 F today on north Pigeon Might be the last go at it this year. Long term weather forecast is not encouraging Peter
