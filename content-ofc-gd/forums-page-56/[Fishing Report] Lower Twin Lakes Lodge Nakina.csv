Day 1: Walleye Lots of fish caught in the 15""-19"" range.  We got our 4 man limit.  Fish fry tor lunch.      Day 2: More walleye and a whitefish We tried trolling for pike but no takers so we went back for some more walleye.  I also caught my first whitefish of the trip.    Day 3: Brookies Today we woke up to frost and fog.  Our goal today was to get into some brook trout at a local stocked pond.  We only got into a few but I caught my first brookie.      Day 4: More Brookies Today we went out again for more brookies with the owner John and he guided us.  It was a huge difference between yesterday and today.  I must've caught over 20+ brookies, all on lures, spinners and spoons.  I wish I took pics of the bigger ones but it was hard to stop to take a pic when the fishing was hot.    Day 5: Exploring near by lakes Today was calling for rain so we decided to go exploring.  We drove around side roads to look for bush chickens but they were scarce.  Google maps lead us to a small lake with some shore line access.  My goal for this lake was to cover water and look for my first pike.  Fish on my second cast, it started to peel drag and I could feel the head shakes.  When I got it closer, I can see it was a laker.  My buddy also caught a whitefish after.     Day 5-7 Was pretty much all same and I barely took any pictures.  Here's what I managed..      The morning we had to leave for Toronto was a snow day     I wish I could've explored all the surrounding lakes but time felt like it was going by fast.  I'm hoping I can make this trip again next year. Lower Twin Lakes Lodge made us feel at home and I would recommend this place to anyone. "

1035627,AKRISONER,2018-10-23 17:01:00,5558,been following your trip on FB and the grams  man the colour on some of those brookies is next level. Gotta love the easy fishing where you get bored of catching so many walleye. Thanks for posting

1035646,Chuck Enwinde,2018-10-24 04:22:00,247,Agreed #metoo.  Gord Ellis wrote a good article about the brookie fishing in some of the small lakes in that area a few years ago.  It's been stuck in my head ever since.
1035674,PUMP KNOWS,2018-10-25 02:34:00,937,I tried to update everyday while I was there but I would get random reception.  I found I'd get best reception while I'm on a boat in the middle of the lake. Brookies are beautiful fish and they taste good too. I wish I did more trout fishing I'll have to search for that article.  I wish the brookies in the rivers were open.
