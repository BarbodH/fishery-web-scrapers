1035556,captpierre,2018-10-21 22:40:00,2521,Only about 1/3 the size of spring show. Wont bother with fall show again
1035561,Fisherman,2018-10-21 23:51:00,7201,"Only for millionaires, hard enough to pay seasonal camp fees never mind land tax, hydro, jump through the hoop sanitation rules etc.  I think it would wiser to rent for a week or two per year and scratch the itch."
1035562,OhioFisherman,2018-10-22 00:08:00,6623,"LOL,and some of those places that are great "" in season "" aren't so great to own out of season?"
1035564,chris.brock,2018-10-22 00:29:00,4053,How busy was it? I don't mind a smaller show but I don't like a gridlock of people.
1035565,captpierre,2018-10-22 00:30:00,2521,I hear you but not sure I agree. We’ve had our cottage now for 6 yrs. It’s been great for our family and now the grandkids.  It cost a pile of money but fortunately has appreciated by 50% since purchase. We spend most of our weekend and holiday time there. We rent it to people we know  3 weeks per year which pays most expenses. I live frugally otherwise. Been a good thing
1035566,captpierre,2018-10-22 00:36:00,2521,Got there Sunday(Last day) 2 pm. Not busy at all. Some end of show discounts but nothing great Spring Show is far better
1035662,Tjames09,2018-10-24 20:01:00,664,lots of water front properties still go for ~300k. No need to be a millionaire; which really isn't that big of a deal anymore since every regular house in the GTA is north of 1 million now anyways. 
1035664,pics,2018-10-24 20:54:00,1268,I had an off-grid cottage for 5 years and I enjoyed the spring show but we sold it and never went back.. It seemed to cater to a market that was way above our budget..
1035670,captpierre,2018-10-24 23:44:00,2521,A lot of expensive clothes and Gucci bags walking around for sure. Different crowd than Sportsman show
1035682,porkpie,2018-10-25 18:56:00,2521,"Not nessecarilly.  Sure, I couldn't afford to buy our family cottage.  It was bought on prime land not to far from the GTA 40 plus years ago.  It's worth a lot now.  I've looked around, there are still affordable places if you are willing to travel a bit more or buy a water access or don't mind being on a river accessing a lake etc.  But there are definately some cash barriers for premium property's or popular locations, especially for someone paying a millions bucks for their principle residence as well."
1035685,Jds63,2018-10-25 19:39:00,1365,a friend of mine bought a 4 acre property near Wilberforce for 16K … not on water but there is a lake with a public boat launch just down the road and  lots of other lakes close by .. helped him clear some land and put up storage shed/bunkie and the road is publicly maintained plans to sell house in GTA in a few years and is already planning to build a small house to retire  …
