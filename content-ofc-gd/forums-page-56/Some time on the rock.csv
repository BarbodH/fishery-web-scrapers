Stayed away from the hoards and just found a nice quiet place to myself. Hot coffee,terns diving for shiners,loons doing the same. Seen 3 lakers swimming around the rock piles. Lots of dink perch to be had, but was a nice way to spend a few hours this morning.Â  Chunked up some shrimp and pressed some salt in it. Seems to work. LOL      "
