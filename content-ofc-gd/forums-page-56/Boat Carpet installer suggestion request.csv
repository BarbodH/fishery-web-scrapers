1035249,mistyriver1,2018-10-15 17:00:00,600,Hi Everyone  Just wondered if anybody had any suggestions for businesses that would install new carpet in your boat.  I'm pondering getting this done but can't seem to find anything from my friend google.  I live north of the GTA but am open to driving a bit if necessary.  Thanks in advance.  Jim
1035250,lew,2018-10-15 17:29:00,12766,Good to hear your still taking care of the old girl Jim
1035253,mistyriver1,2018-10-15 18:03:00,600,"Absolutely Lew !! You know it will be 10 years since I bought her from you.  Ill have owned her longer than you next year.  Boat still runs great, it is the perfect layout and she has lots of good karma. Got a new cover for her this year so am thinking about getting the carpet redone.  Corey got himself a 17 foot Lund this year (dual console)....Still like fishing in the Crestliner better.   "
1035254,Whopper,2018-10-15 18:10:00,2174,Blast from past lol. It's been at least 10 years since since I fished out of that Crestliner ? WOW That boat has served both of you guys well
1035257,lew,2018-10-15 18:47:00,12766,"Here's the day it became official Jim, really has been a long time. "
1035258,mistyriver1,2018-10-15 18:59:00,600,I remember that day very well. Scary thing now Lew is I am probably that much shorter than Ben Great memory for sure 
1035261,lew,2018-10-15 19:24:00,12766,"It'd be great to see Ben & Cory again, hard to believe how they've grown now."
1035262,misfish,2018-10-15 19:30:00,29133,Say what Nice to hear from you Jim.
1035263,misfish,2018-10-15 19:34:00,29133,"Think Im about the same. That boat catches musky off the bow, and bass off the stern."
1035264,lew,2018-10-15 19:41:00,12766, I think this was the 1st time Phil 
1035265,mistyriver1,2018-10-15 19:43:00,600,Thanks Brian...hope all is well with you as well ! A pic of Corey's boat....it's alright lol  
1035266,mistyriver1,2018-10-15 19:44:00,600,I remember that !!! and I know what lake too !!
1035269,Whopper,2018-10-15 19:55:00,2174,"Your right Lew, that was the first time and first muskie too ☺️ Jim I know you know where that is lol, the last picture I saw of the boys I couldn't believe my eyes, Cory needed a haircut and Ben was a giant. BTW, I still fish out of the same shirt ?"
1035289,bucktail,2018-10-16 11:54:00,1857,I need to get the same thing done as well. Just plane wore it out!  
1035291,Loonietoon,2018-10-16 13:07:00,1450,Happy to see you are still around Jim...?
1035298,KawarthaAngler,2018-10-16 13:56:00,273,"I live in the Peterborough area and started to look into getting boat recarpeted a year ago.  I found there weren't any places that wanted to take on such a job.  I ended up doing the work myself and doing it in pieces.  So far it has gone well. I purchased my marine carpet from https://www.jtsoutdoorfabrics.com/ I talked to a couple local flooring stores and they only sell outdoor carpet.  It isn't the same.  It doesn't have a rubber backing and it doesn't have a tight weave.  Definitely purchase quality marine carpet if you go that route.   One of the stores I talked to told me a fellow asked them to recarpet his boat.  Because it is so much labor I was told that even though it was only approx $400 in material the bill was still upwards of $5K.   It just depends on what type of boat you have and how much is carpeted. For me, I'm just replacing the carpet on the horizontal parts that I walk on.  Those are the areas that are a problem.  The sides of my boat are fine and so I'm not doing the sides (it's a Fish & Ski boat, so every damn inch of the inside is carpeted).  I could not get same colour so I picked black which now gives the boat a 2-tone look and it looks fine. I found I need to replace the wood because its rotting.  I didn't plan for that, so that adds to the job.   I just use the old piece as a template and cut a new piece.  Just need a jig saw, a scroll saw and a power drill.  There are lots of YouTube videos on this.  They are a good resource if you want to give it a try. A couple pics from when I was doing the bow section.   "
1035309,mistyriver1,2018-10-16 15:03:00,600,Thanks for the reply Kawartha angler.  Nice job on your boat.
1035310,mistyriver1,2018-10-16 15:04:00,600,Hope all is well Sir
1035334,Loonietoon,2018-10-16 20:38:00,1450,Doing well Jim... Now retired and now own a 2005 16.5 Crestliner Sport Angler with 90 merc   
1035335,Loonietoon,2018-10-16 20:39:00,1450,2nd Crestliner l have owned ?
1035345,misfish,2018-10-16 22:11:00,29133,Nice ride Kelvin.
1035349,Loonietoon,2018-10-16 22:46:00,1450,Thank you... had to put that smooth ride seat in for my back ... expensive but worth it?
1035352,boombap,2018-10-16 22:52:00,310,Do it yourself man.. it really is easy once you get the hang of it. It's not worth w.e your going to pay a shop to do it.
1035360,irishfield,2018-10-17 00:08:00,26272,When you pull it all out and do new wood Jim.. wrap it all in vinyl and forget about it for the rest of your life!! Ditch the permanent carpet and add some snap ins if you like. Love mine. I roll the snap in carpet up and store before the Fall Musky hunt begins..  
1035365,Rattletrap2,2018-10-17 01:39:00,1652,"Nice to see the great workmanship on the re-carpeting job! I'm really smiling from seeing some old names from the past on this thread! Jim, Lew, Whopper, Kelvin, Wayne.......It's like old home week! lol"
