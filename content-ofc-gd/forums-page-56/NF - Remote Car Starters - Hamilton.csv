1035394,Raycaster,2018-10-17 22:14:00,528,I promise this is the last NON-FISHING post for awhile. Don't want to abuse the awesome feedback here but truth is... its awesome that someone on this board is always able to help out on every subject. I'm a hobbyist computer/electronic guy but the last remote start kit I installed was over 5 years ago and if I remember correctly I made a note never to do it again. It was a Ford kit involving over 10 wires and splicing into several car spaghetti looms under the dash.  I now have a 2016 Ford Edge SEL and wonder if things have changed to make it harder or easier DIY. I looked quickly on Amazon and the first couple kits seemed to have a cutoff of 2014. The Ford dealership quoted me $599 with a smile. I put out a few other emails to Hamilton Installers but still waiting for replies.  If anyone has had any luck with these lately for DIY or can suggest installers please let me know. Thx.

1035397,Raycaster,2018-10-17 22:25:00,528,I think its always tricky due to having to work around the security. I was able to install on my old Freestar but it was brutal trying to match wiring coloring that didn't exist etc...

1035402,misfish,2018-10-17 23:20:00,29133,So my truck is basic.2014. Just a key to enter and start. NO FOB. Can I get an remote starter with a fob?
