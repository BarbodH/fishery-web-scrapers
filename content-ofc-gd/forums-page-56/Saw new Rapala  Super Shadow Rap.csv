1034530,OhioFisherman,2018-09-29 03:35:00,6623,"https://www.ebay.com/itm/New-2018-Rapala-Super-Shadow-Rap-16cm-77g-lure-for-large-predators-COLORS-/192449665143 Just for a look, 6 1/4 inches and 2 3/4 ounces? Limited info on them here, they seem to be a European market lure?"
1034532,Snidley,2018-09-29 05:11:00,620,"They are  Euro lures. Colour names  like Roach, live Roach and Mirror Carp says Europe for sure. You would not believe what a disgusting slimeball a Roach actually is. The goo literally drips off them. European Bream and Tench are also unpleasant animals. They do get big pike over there but I don't think they get them in the big numbers we do here. In the video on Rapala.ca it looks like they are a sinker not a floater or suspender. They do look nice for that type of huge lure"
1034559,adempsey,2018-09-30 04:08:00,1498,"I almost ordered a bunch of those Super Shadow Raps, but had to restrain myself. They look really nice. The X-Rap Peto looks sweet too.    "
1034571,Snidley,2018-09-30 19:41:00,620,TYhose Peto look like a big fish catcher in cool water.
1034580,Garfisher,2018-10-01 00:59:00,229,"I ordered one on eBay way back in the spring (in Artistic Burbot) and fished it the only time I've fished muskies this year back in June. It has a pretty wicked action to it when worked and it casts really well. Ended up having a bass or something maybe 3 times the size of the lure take a swing at it, and then ended up missing a fish on it a little later. I've been getting the urge to toss it lately come to think of it haha"
1034885,KraTToR,2018-10-08 02:48:00,506,"Picked one up at Natural Sports today - they are $20.  Small and heavy, should cast a country mile.  Apparently you can rip it or jerk it with a slow sinking action... I'll report back if I get any takers..."
