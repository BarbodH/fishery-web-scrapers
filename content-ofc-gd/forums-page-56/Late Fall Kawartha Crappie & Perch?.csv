Anyone do any late fall Crappie or Perch fishing in the Kawartha's?  I've done spring Crappie fishing and guys will talk about it (and some of the fishing shows cover it) but don't hear much about late fall.  A friend of mine mentioned it to me a couple years back.  I've tried it a bit and not had any luck.  Anyone try it and have luck?  If so, any tips? Thanks!"
1035592,BillM,2018-10-22 14:57:00,17367,I find crappies move shallower before turnover.
1035602,KawarthaAngler,2018-10-22 17:13:00,273,Thanks BillM. I understand they are quite temp sensitive. In the spring once the water temp is just right I know they move into the shallows. What water temp would play a part of them coming back to shallower areas in the fall?  I haven't been on the water in a few weeks so don't know what the temp is at the moment.

Temp is mid to low 50's if not less."
