1035047,misfish,2018-10-10 20:57:00,29133,"The tv is 5 yo. Works great. All of a sudden got an issue with the power on. Takes a bit to finally get it on. Unplug,plug back in numerous times. Have to use the push button on the side of the tv. Oh and the converter works ( once the tv comes on ), so it,s not the batterys.   I really think this is a easy fix, but thought I would ask all my friends here first if any one else has had this problem and if they got it fixed. Really don't have a grand to burn on a new tv. Ya theres cheaper ones out there, and ya, get a couple of years for 3-4 hundo is a deal I guess.  Sorry for the NF, but had too.  B"
1035048,grimsbylander,2018-10-10 21:11:00,3016,"Brian, will the power button on the remote turn the TV off once it's on?"
1035049,ketchenany,2018-10-10 21:16:00,3229,Try anew HDMI cable. They are troublesome.
1035050,misfish,2018-10-10 21:19:00,29133,Yes
1035051,misfish,2018-10-10 21:37:00,29133,"Albert, how would this effect turning on the tv?"
1035053,ketchenany,2018-10-10 22:00:00,3229,"Mine would turn off while viewing it! Giggle the cable and on it came. Called Rogers and they told me to change it. Bought one for 12, dollar store  3. The cheap one is fine. Find out I already had two spares. This worked for me."
1035059,misfish,2018-10-10 22:31:00,29133,Well we have a new one here. Just found it.  Will try it later. TV is working and the voice is coming on. I dont want to here those nasty words. LOL  Will post out come later.  Thanks
1035082,misfish,2018-10-11 11:09:00,29133,Swapped it out this morning Albert. No change. I think I will take it in.. Worth 30 bucks to have a look see.
1035084,Headhunter,2018-10-11 12:56:00,5703,"Best guess Brian is that you have a wonky power supply in the TV. Likely, it didn't like the spikes sent through the lines during one of our many thunderstorms and your power supply has taken the hit. It Samsung is anything like Panasonic, the power supply module is around $500 to replace. I'd be looking at Costco for a replacement and buying the 5 year extended warranty for $60. Sorry to be the one to pass along bad news... HH"
1035086,misfish,2018-10-11 13:46:00,29133,Ya Joe. I have noticed my BRAND NEW PC has been wonky about the same time. Everything is on power bars.
1035098,Headhunter,2018-10-11 15:53:00,5703,"Power bars are useless for power surges. In order to get real power surge protection, you need to spend big bucks! A $15 power bar is  not going to be able to do that for you. A power condition will do that, but $$$$$$! You may have an opportunity to get some money back from your power supplier in Barrie, if you can show them that their dirty power is what killed your TV. A quick call to your provider will give you the info you need. Good luck Brian. HH"
1035125,KawarthaAngler,2018-10-11 20:21:00,273,Got a used 50 inch tv that I just took in for a servicing because it would not stay on. The fix was re-soldering connections on the power supply. $100 job. A lot less $ and wasteful than looking at a new TV.
1035126,misfish,2018-10-11 21:32:00,29133,"New Samsung hooked up, WITH POWER SURGE protection. Walmart had a great deal. 42"" HD 7. Got warranty as well. If we get 5 years out of it for the price I paid, way ahead of the game. I will take the other in to have a look see. If it,s a cheap fix, it will go on the wall in the bed room. LOL  Thanks guys  Now to get through friday, and I am fishing 9 days straight."
1035127,misfish,2018-10-11 21:40:00,29133,"Let me guess, DON'T TURN IT OFF. LMAO  We thought about that . LOL"
1035128,grimsbylander,2018-10-11 21:46:00,3016,I never said that!! Though now I wish I'd thought of it! Lol
1035134,ketchenany,2018-10-11 23:20:00,3229,If it doesn’t work out use the glass from the OLD  TV on top of the smoker and get rid of the cardboard.! A TV in the bedroom will cut down on your  ‘fishing’ time! ?
