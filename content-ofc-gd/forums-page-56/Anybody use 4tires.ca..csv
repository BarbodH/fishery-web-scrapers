1035268,Fisherman,2018-10-15 19:54:00,7201,"Just checked Michelin Defender, still cheaper at Costco and if you run into problems you can go back to Costco along with free balance and rotating.  I don't see too many 4tires.ca stores anywhere. Same for winter tires, WS80 Blizzak for car, $10 a tire cheaper at Costco."
1035281,chris.brock,2018-10-16 01:32:00,4053,Is there actual brick and mortar stores? I thought they were totally online. I looked into sellers like this and tirerack.com etc but ended up at CT. Costco is probably an even better option like Fisherman mentioned.
