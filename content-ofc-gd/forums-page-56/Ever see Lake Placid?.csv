1034967,Mike Pike,2018-10-09 18:08:00,1332,"Crazy!  I'm gonna guess it escaped or was release from a reptile zoo or somewhere.  We had a similar situation happen in Hamilton a few years ago.  It made the papers too. And yup, I DID see Lake Placid and it's one of my all-time favourite movies.  Great special effects and funny as hell! "
1034968,OhioFisherman,2018-10-09 19:06:00,6623,"LOL Mike, ya my kind of movie! but the story actual is even crazier, sounds like someone set it out to die with it's mouth tied? shut. http://www.cleveland19.com/video/2018/10/09/fisherman-rescues-foot-alligator-cold-waters-lake-michigan/"
1034970,Mike Pike,2018-10-09 19:53:00,1332,It gets stranger and stranger.  It's gonna be interesting to see if they can figure out the story behind that little gator and how it got there.
