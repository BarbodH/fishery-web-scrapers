1035719,Terry,2018-10-26 23:30:00,14456,any 24v 40 + amp stud type circuit  breaker should work princess auto should have them
1035720,OhioFisherman,2018-10-26 23:47:00,6623,"I have no idea what marine stores you have up there, one of the ones in my area lists this product. BLUE SEA SYSTEMS 40A Marine Grade Short Stop Circuit Breaker | West Marine Does it have to be an exact match? One of your marine stores may carry them?"
1035721,cheaptackle,2018-10-27 00:43:00,849,"Any type of 24 volt dc 40 amp breaker or fuse will do the job.  I'd say get the breaker, re-settable just like in a house.  Michael"
1035733,Garnet,2018-10-27 11:29:00,2056,"Stereo stores have them. Princes Auto, nappa  , CARQUEST. The battery side contact little harder to find. "
