I never knew there were even musky in there, but I'll be going out with a few guys who have more experience than I do. Appreciate any general tips for this area, general locations or lures that I should try. Thanks!"

1034412,KawarthaAngler,2018-09-24 19:15:00,273,"I landed a small muskie on the Otonabee river along a weed line throwing top water just before sunset in mid August.  It was one of the many areas where there is a shallow, lillypad loaded bay.  I simply stayed along the outside edge and was throwing weedless jig hunting for bass.  This one evening there were a few splashes in the lilypads and I said to my co-angler ""I think muskie have come into the shallows to feed, I'm going to throw a top water along the edge"" ... 2nd cast and BAM.  Landed a small muskie. I haven't been back on the Ontonabee since ... but that was my experience."
1034522,KraTToR,2018-09-28 16:54:00,506,Anyone been on the river lately?  I'm interested to find out what the water temp is at these days...
1034525,Sinker,2018-09-28 22:17:00,8692,"I havent been on the river, but the lake I was on on wed was 65, and the musky were chompin. We went 4 for 6.  S."
