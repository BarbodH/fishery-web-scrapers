We got a foot and a half of snow the first week of October, last year was the 3rd week. At least I got my boat put away in time this year! No raking leaf piles and jumping in them with Jack ,  instead we just built our first snow fort at the weekend. And its COLD! Last 2 weeks has not seen temps much above 0ºC, and some of the small ponds have already got shore to shore skims.............................        Bird hunting also took a hit like last year, which is a shame because before the snow fell it was looking like a banner year, I only managed to get out with the kids from work, but each time we went, we got our limit and saw 20+ birds.        Fishing is still good from shore, turnover happened real quick this year, and the lake I like to go to shore fishing is already on its downward trajectory in terms of the bite as the fish slow down. Still enough to keep me going back, although ice on the guides makes it a challenge some days. All I can hope for is perhaps 1 shot at crappie in the boat on our lake if my schedule permits, otherwise all there is left to say this year is BRING ON THE ICE!   "

1035434,misfish,2018-10-18 19:02:00,29133,Nice Simon. I had a couple of deer visit me this morning on the river. I like the latex gloves as well. I use black ones. I have been wetting my hands then putting them on. Also don't use tight ones. One size up works great.Seems to work for me retaining heat.
