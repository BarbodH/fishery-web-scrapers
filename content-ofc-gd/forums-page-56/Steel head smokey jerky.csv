1035696,iFish4real,2018-10-26 12:37:00,386,I'll trade you some moose jerky for some of your fish ?  
1035708,misfish,2018-10-26 17:04:00,29133,Who can say no to that trade. Nice looking jerky Casian.
1035731,smitty55,2018-10-27 04:43:00,928,Yea looks good for sure. I've always cut my jerky cross grain and narrower strips so I can rip a piece off and then work on it. You prefer it it that way I take it? I bet it takes a lot more jaw work lol.
1035736,iFish4real,2018-10-27 12:59:00,386,"Not at all. They're very thin strips and moose was young so, very tender jerky..."
