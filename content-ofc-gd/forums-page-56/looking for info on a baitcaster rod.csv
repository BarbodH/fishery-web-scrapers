1035463,hotsky,2018-10-19 03:04:00,400,"Sorry for the noob question , but Im looking for some into on a Shimano compre baitcaster rod. model is CO-76XH. I know it 7.5 feet...extra heavy? whats the ideal use? too thin for musky I think, too short for salmon... and is this something of any value or is it a walmart special cheapo rod?     "
1035465,Chuck Enwinde,2018-10-19 04:53:00,247,Bass in or near cover would probably be it's primary use.  Might work for pike or muskie depending on the action.   Not a Walmart cheapy - probably in the $100 range.
1035468,buick14,2018-10-19 11:24:00,741,"Super old rod, maybe one of the first compre’s. as chuck said pitching flipping worming in cover.  It looks like a spinning rod handle.... its value now isn’t very much, unless it’s new or like new with the tags for a collector.  Used condition under $50"
1035475,Lape0019,2018-10-19 15:55:00,647,"I'd have to echo what others have said. I have owned two compres and this rod is older than either of them.  Definitely a model in their bass lineup put would handle pike and smaller muskies fine. Length and lure rating would be ideal for flipping/pitching, possibly punching and for sure frogging depending on the taper. These rods aren't something you will find at Walmart or most Canadian tires but they are not cheap. I think their current price is in the $120-$150 range. The ones I had were nice for their time for sure. I sold them a few season after getting them for $50-$80 dollars."
1035478,BillM,2018-10-19 16:18:00,17367,You could use that as a heavy cover bass rod or a jerkbait rod for muskie/pike without issue.
1035811,bow slayer,2018-10-29 13:20:00,1074,"i own 3 compres 2 spinning rods and 1 baitcaster rod ,good rods all in the 150 new price range."
1035837,Reef Runner,2018-10-29 17:48:00,980,"I've owned a few compres over the years.  Still use a jig and worm in medium.  That's an older model for sure, later models were black/dark green.  in addition to use as others said, I'd believe that would be a good stick for tossing spinner baits."
