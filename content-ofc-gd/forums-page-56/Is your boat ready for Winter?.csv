1035618,bigbuck,2018-10-23 14:53:00,2449,Mine is away for the year. Every mechanic that has ever gone near my lower unit has always cheaped out and gone with either Dino or semi synthetic. I always use synthetic. Canadian Tire being the best source. You don't want water in those lowers boys. The condition of the gear oil speaks volumes about the condition of your lower unit.
1035781,Mister G,2018-10-28 15:14:00,1429,"My E-TEC is effortlessly to winterize.....I put Evinrude's 2+4 gas treatment in the tank for the last couple of times out ...Then run the motor on Winterization Mode (less then 2 minutes)  either at the launch before pulling the boat out or in the driveway and the power head is good to go as the motor fogs itself. Take out the lower gear case screw and check for water........never any yet. DONE OH, I also grease my Dexter Trailer Hubs until only new Lucas Red N Tacky grease comes out. Each hub almost takes a full 14 oz tube. As far as the livewells, I just crank the boat all the way up on the trailer and they self drain........sometime I will use my compressor to blow out the feed lines and drain but nothing ever comes out after the boat sits up high for a few days. BTW I can still fish and just rerun the Winterization Mode again and again if need be."
1035392,irishfield,2018-10-17 21:57:00,26272,"'Tis the season... at least check your lower units for water by simply removing the lower plug and seeing what comes out first. Oil you're good, water.. well no! Both of my engines upper and lower oils changed, plus fuel and oil filters on the Verado, and the live well and power wash pumps anti-freezed and capped. Ready for the Musky season if I find the time... You should have already had some stabilizer in your fuel on the last boat ride, but if not add some to the tank at least for storage.     "
1035403,DRIFTER_016,2018-10-17 23:32:00,10439,Put mine away a couple of weeks ago.
1035406,crappieperchhunter,2018-10-17 23:48:00,2582,Still have a solid month of chasing perch on simcoe before my baby gets put away for the winter. And I have stabilizer mixed into every tank of my gas.  BTW nice looking work Wayne. Your fishing stuff will outlast you if you keep looking after it like that.
1035407,Rizzo,2018-10-18 00:12:00,4754,don't talk that way! Got out in the boat this past Monday in the crazy winds and have a couple more trips planned still. Right now looks like end of November will be my last time out
1035408,irishfield,2018-10-18 00:35:00,26272,"Looks like 2 out of 3 missed my point! I'm not done either, I generally fish even after I have to take the plow truck to the boat ramp and plow it myself. I always do the oil BEFORE we have freezing weather, as it will only take one good cold night to crack that lower unit if you have water in it!  .. and CPH, the boat just makes me look good. She's got 10 full summers sitting in the water, as we missed two summers chasing Jen around.  "
1035409,DRIFTER_016,2018-10-18 01:09:00,10439,??? 
1035410,DRIFTER_016,2018-10-18 01:12:00,10439,
1035426,Garnet,2018-10-18 17:44:00,2056,I'm on Irish schedule . Around Nov 15 I add critter kill  blocks from TSC with peanut butter . Put the tarp on . I've been river fishing  for 2 months so ramp that up. Hit the ice. I recommend retirement
1035428,AKRISONER,2018-10-18 17:53:00,5558,good thought on the lower end oil...might have to get on that this weekend.
1035432,BillM,2018-10-18 18:23:00,17367,Lots of muskie fishing to do still.   Boat isn't get winterized just yet.
1035441,Dan668,2018-10-18 20:01:00,1120,"Yep, just need the damn winds to go away."
1035447,lew,2018-10-18 20:49:00,12766,"Just think of the winds as ""musky chop"" LOL"
1035448,BillM,2018-10-18 21:05:00,17367,Wouldn't that be nice.
1035450,Whitespinnerbait,2018-10-18 21:38:00,2038,"Question here, If there was water in the lower end would the oil not leak out and visible in lake or river?  "
1035451,irishfield,2018-10-18 21:51:00,26272,If you were paying attention possibly. Blow a shaft seal or have a loose vent screw / gasket and water being heavier goes in and oil comes out. I did a ladies 15 HP merc on the island next door before she went home this Fall and her entire lower unit was full of water... zero oil. Dropped it at the marina for her so they can pressure test and re and re seals as I had no time for it.
1035452,Rizzo,2018-10-18 21:54:00,4754,"for those of you who do the lower unit now, but then fish a few more times, do you change it again later? Or do you just do a quick check? or maybe you have the luxury of heated garage?"
1035453,irishfield,2018-10-18 22:01:00,26272,I do all the oils now Roger and then Musky fish. Bonus is that when you finally winter store everything is coated in clean oil.. not the full seasons used. Quick check for water on final bed'y bye! 2 minutes to pop the lower screw and put it back in. Oil will barely drip out while water will flow with the upper vent screw still in place.
1035455,DRIFTER_016,2018-10-18 22:14:00,10439,Will be very milky too.
1035467,Garnet,2018-10-19 11:13:00,2056,If you do have water pop that foot off and take it to repair guy. They love winter work and you stay out of spring madness.
1035469,mikeh,2018-10-19 14:46:00,824,"the picture with the anti freeze, is tat how you put anti freeze in the live well lines? I have to do mine and wondering what the procedure is?"
1035470,irishfield,2018-10-19 14:51:00,26272,"Yes, I have through hull pumps. Turn on pump, add antifreeze until it comes out in the live well /  power washer hose. Many just let their boats drain, but consider if it doesn't completely and the pump cracks...  your boat sinks!"
1035485,Headhunter,2018-10-19 17:44:00,5703,One can never be too prepared Wayne! HH  
1035486,Terry,2018-10-19 17:54:00,14456,"oh no, up in smoke again"
1035498,DRIFTER_016,2018-10-19 20:10:00,10439,Is that hose tucked in yer pantaloons? Cause you look like a pretty fart smeller!!!  ?? 
1035500,irishfield,2018-10-19 21:29:00,26272,"Thanks for the larfs Joe!! I came prepared that year to drop in on you BOQ guys!! How you guys slept there is beyond me. Man I had some pounds on me then, dropping the Pepsi from my diet took car of that, now steady at 185lbs. Think I was 225 there..."
