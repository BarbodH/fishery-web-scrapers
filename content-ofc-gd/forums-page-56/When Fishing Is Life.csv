He was driving and on the way we saw a couple of questionable towns to which we joked were pretty ""greasy"" well my buddy says, ""phhh wait till we get to scugog, scugog is greasy"" and i laugh and reply ""we shall see""  Well what do you know, the very first thing we see as we pull into scugog is a guy on a ride on lawn mower towing a bow rider down main street....Confirmed Scugog...to quote bubbles from Trailer Park Boys is ""Greeeaaaheee-e-e-e-sy"""
