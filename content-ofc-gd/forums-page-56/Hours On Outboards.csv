1035131,Musky Plug,2018-10-11 22:36:00,398,"Yes, I like that idea.  Yes I've taken a look at a couple and the pictures were deceiving. The Interior carpets weren't in great shape and neither were the interior compartments. Yes I've been told to check everything with a fine tooth comb and make sure everything is in working order."
1035163,Garnet,2018-10-12 13:13:00,2056,There is buddy's story and the story the boat is telling you. 
1035165,Lape0019,2018-10-12 13:51:00,647,"All advice I have read here is great but I seem to be missing some rather large pieces of information. Everything states is generally great advice but the size of the motor must be taken into considerations as well. You have stated the motors are Honda 4 stroke and Yamaha (I assume 2 stroke because of the age). What is the HP rating of these motors? What is the HP rating and length of the boats you are looking at that these motors are attached to? Getting the compression tested and the leak down test done will tell you a lot about the motor but it doesn't mean everything. Being these motors are 13-15 years old and are still kicking, they should be alright. Bring them to a mechanic and see if you can get an hour count by RPM range too. It may not be possible because of the age but unless you ask, you won't know. If most of the hours are closer to WOT but the compression and leak down test come back good, I wouldn't be concerned if the hours were in a range I was happy with. If they don't come back good, I would more than likely walk away or take that into the consideration of my offer. The size of the motor would be key here too. Are we talking a 50HP or a 250HP? One is more likely to blow than the other if not treated properly as well as be more expensive to replace/repair. For me, if a 13-15 year old boat had anywhere between 300-450hours on it and passed all of the tests, I would be happy. I know how I use my boat and have about 20 hours on it this year so if this ends up being my average, I will be at about 350 hours in that timeframe (assuming 15 years here and my season is not over yet. If you are able to provide any information on the boat itself as well as the HP of the motors, I may have more thoughts of what you should be looking for.   "
1035172,grimsbylander,2018-10-12 16:12:00,3016,"My exact point earlier. To me, hours matter on a 115 and up...who every asks hours on a 9.9 lol If you can't pull the hours from the motor, don't bother asking. Whatever the motor is, just get it checked out by certified brand specific mechanic. Not by the owner, not by you, and not by a buddy of a buddy. Too much money on the line to gamble just to save $100 up front. Even a ""simple"" compression check is useless if it's not done correctly so why even bother doing it?? Outboards are definitely in the penny wise pound foolish category."
1035194,Musky Plug,2018-10-13 12:28:00,398,Both motors are 4 stroke. The boat that has the 115hp is 17ft and rated for 125 max hp. The other with the 90hp was 16.5ft and I’m not sure about the max hp as it was already sold before I had a chance to look. I also was going to take it to a Honda marine mechanic in that area to have the appropriate test run.
1035308,Lape0019,2018-10-16 15:02:00,647,"Sucks you missed out on one of them but the other should still be a viable option. The smaller outboards seem to stand the test of time better than the 150 and above category. As long as everything checks out on the remaining boat and it is what you are looking for, you should be good to go.   "
1034791,Musky Plug,2018-10-06 16:40:00,398,Hey guys looking for some advice. Currently looking at possibly purchasing a new boat one with 115 Honda 4stroke and other Yamaha. Both boats are around 13-15 years old. Both are in visibly good condition but how many hours would be considered to many on a boat of that age? 
1034793,Fisherman,2018-10-06 17:09:00,7201,"Too many, all depends on previous use and how the owner treated it.  I gave a 20 year old Honda 25 to a family member, it needed a new gasket in one spot, that was it.  When the mechanic looked at the internals, he told me it looked like new, no wear on the cams or valves, 100% compression.  I used the Amsoil synthetic and that motor probably had 2000 hours on it.  I'm not one to start a motor and immediately try to go warp speed, let things warm up a bit and go moderately before cruising."
1034794,LostAnotherOne,2018-10-06 17:43:00,956,Bought a 14 footer with a 20 Yamaha behind it 3 years ago from a member on here.  Both were made in 96 and works great.  All depends on how it was looked after over the years.  Good luck
1034796,Garnet,2018-10-06 19:36:00,2056,Start with a compression test.
1034799,HTHM,2018-10-06 23:22:00,4082,And then a leak-down test  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leak-down_tester
1034801,captpierre,2018-10-07 01:45:00,2521,As far as I know. Hours don’t reflect RPMs. Big difference if trolling vs WOT.
1034807,Old Ironmaker,2018-10-07 03:20:00,8243,"Exactly as above by catpierre. I wouldn't buy a low mileage car from someone that uses it at the track or drags every weekend. I  have a saying, ""Never buy a snowmachine from someone in the Arctic and never buy a boat from Florida."" For anyone looking to buy a watercraft I strongly suggest going to iboats.com. and searching there then asking questions. Search first and if you don't find your answer then ask a specific question. There is a sticky under General Boating that is a great list of things to look for on a used boat/engine. https://forums.iboats.com/forum/general-boating-outdoors-activities/boat-topics-and-questions-not-engine-topics"
1034822,Musky Plug,2018-10-07 16:15:00,398, I'm assuming I would have to take it to a mechanic in order to check those?
1034823,Musky Plug,2018-10-07 16:17:00,398,What does WOT stand for?
1034824,Musky Plug,2018-10-07 16:17:00,398,"Thanks Ironmaker, I will check it out."

1034848,Garnet,2018-10-07 18:41:00,2056,compression is easy testor at prince auto $10. Take all plugs out keep them in order. install tester. flip safety switch so no power. Now turn motor and the needle will go up. Record number press button releasing pressure. do all cylinders in order. The rule is 10% no more.
1034876,Old Ironmaker,2018-10-08 00:22:00,8243,"Check compression by taking out 1 plug at a time.  Equal compression above 100 pounds per  square inch (PSI) is great. But just a single compression test doesn't determine a good engine. A good start yes. You need to also check the bottom end for metal fatigue. Best is to drain the bottom end gear lube and check for metal filings and or a milky consistency which indicates water in the gear lube. The upper vent plug is magnetic on 90% of outboards (OB) and inboard outboards (IO). Filings may be stuck on the plug, not good. Marine engines running while on a water line in a driveway is not under load. It might just sound fine but running any boat under load in the water is the best test. A marine mechanic will charge you around 100 bucks to do this and more before you buy. If a seller isn't willing to tow the boat or have a mechanic go to the boat I would run away from the deal. The best thing this mechanically challenged former Steel worker did was to take a small engine repair course. It has saved me a few grand in paying Marine dealers to do simple tasks over the years such as simple compression tests, maintenance and winterizing.

1034896,Musky Plug,2018-10-08 14:38:00,398,"Read this and it reminded me of a girl a used to know  I will have to look into this, thanks.  Thanks Ironmaker. Yes I wouldn't buy a boat without taking it to a mechanic or a water test."
1034901,Tjames09,2018-10-08 15:54:00,664,"I don’t know. If I was selling my boat I wouldn’t tow it at my expensive to a marine mechanic and have it left there for them to look at it. If someone wanted to bring a mechanic with them be my guest. But I wouldn’t have someone I didn’t know draining my gear oil to check things, whose replacing the oil, whose responsible for getting rid of the oil now?  I wouldn’t write off a boat if someone wouldn’t drop it off at a mechanic. Boats on kijiji that are priced well get mutiple offers to view in the spring. You can’t take it a mechanic for everyone that’s tire kicking."
1034903,Musky Plug,2018-10-08 16:42:00,398,"I agree i wouldn't want some random trying to do these things however I'd think if you wanted to sell it then that's something that you would do? Also why would you leave it there? Wouldn't you want to see what comes of the inspection?  Not taking it to a mechanic for me would be a deal breaker. That would say to me that there may be potential issues with the motor. I'm not that well versed in outboard mechanics and would prefer someone who is trained have a look, before I spend a bunch of my money on what could be someone else's problem. I agree that you can't take it to a mechanic for every potential buyer however you should be able to weed those people out and try to deal with only serious buyers.  Also if you do end up taking it to a mechanic, would it not be possible to get the things that most people would want checked it writing?"
1034906,DanD,2018-10-08 16:59:00,2223,"I agree here. If the seller is willing to have this inspection done; it would making the sale much easier. Spend a hundred bucks and tack it on the price of the rig. If the shop that's doing the inspection has a good rep; the potential buyer could go and speak to the company about their findings. Just like selling a car, have it certified and offer up all service documents you have; it'll sell twice as easy."
1034924,grimsbylander,2018-10-08 22:27:00,3016,"Talk to the owner and work out a mutually beneficial agreement to get the motor checked out by a same-brand service dealer. No offense to anyone on here but I've yet to read instructions that are complete for a proper compression test and they're not the same for every motor! Tell the owner you'll pay for his towing costs and if you don't buy it, you'll give him the mechanics report. It's a win win. As far as hours go, yes it depends on maintenance and ownership but also on the motor size and model. The 4 strokes are getting huge hours even in 250 class range whereas 2 strokes in the same range far short. Research the reviews on the two motors choices you have in front of you and see what you can pick up. Good luck."
1034933,mistaredone,2018-10-09 01:55:00,913,"I’m in the same situation but I’m looking at a fish n ski boat.  The 2005 225 I’m looking looking at has 185 hours but dealer maintained, he paid For the diagnostic report. Seems like the kinda person that’s stay on  top of things. The onther one is a 2005 Stratos 486 150 with only 50hours but they guy doesn’t know his boat and doesn’t maintain at a dealer/marina   I’m leaning towards the the 225 as crazy as that sounds sounds. EITHER way I’ll have a mechanic look at it. That’s a deal breaker for me. HAVING A hard time  WTH yhe app sFOR SOME REASON I’ll post aha in once the once worked out worked out"
1034940,porkpie,2018-10-09 09:07:00,2521,"If the motor is a 4 stroke then 180 hours is peanuts.  Heck I hear even the opti-pops make it to 1000 hours sometimes.  A 4 stroke that is well maintained with good compression should run for 1000's of hours.  I have a zuke with 450 hours on the dial.  I've read reports of many commercial suzukis, yamahas and Hondas in excess of 6000 hours plus.  Most guys won't mind taking a boat to a marine mechanic if you are paying as that tells them your not just a tire kicker.  The exception is the spring.  I sold my last boat in the spring, and had way too many guys interested and calling/emailing me to mess around.  It sold same day to the first guy  that showed up.  You will have better negotiability in the fall."
1034941,Mister G,2018-10-09 10:12:00,1429,"Always, I repeat ALWAYS take a used boat for a test ride I would also mention to TEST RIDE the boat in question.......bring along a couple of heavy set buddies and FILL the livewells up to see if the boat is properly power by the outboard and not under powered. You can take the engine to any mechanic but it's the TEST RIDE that will tell you a LOT and see if the boat leaks too."
1034943,Garnet,2018-10-09 11:08:00,2056,You are just starting. You need to look  at the nuts and bolts under the cowling. Motor work can't be done  without leaving marks. Look at the block if you see odd bulges with spider cracks. Same with lower unit cone.  Previous blow ups. Get in boat and walk every inch. Most important get under the boat. Everything tells a story.
1034946,grimsbylander,2018-10-09 12:43:00,3016,That Suzuki @ 450 hours is almost broken in!! lol Great motors.
1034949,Chris J,2018-10-09 14:14:00,44,"I would not purchase a boat based on an hour meter or a printout, there is a lot more to it than that.  Some good advice in here as to what to look for but hours shouldn't be make or break."
1035054,Tjames09,2018-10-10 22:06:00,664,"I agree with the comments above. I think you can see a lot of things visually yourself or with a good water test. with a good visual check everything in all the compartments, everything underneath you don't initially see. Check for mold, cracks, things rescrewed together. Test all the wood by walking and seeing if there are soft spots. I mean you can tell if a boat is cared for pretty quickly with a visual inspection. When I bought my boat I looked at A LOT of boats. I could tell instantly if a boat is cared for or not. Boats show weathering pretty badly when left to the elements and not cared for, stored properly etc. After a good visual inspection and good long water test is a must. Test everything on the water test to. Test the live wells, test trolling motor, test the lights, test it all. Don't rush.  I think those things will go a lot more than hours on a motor."
