Not sure what the ruling is for if the fish is foul hooked by accident (not deliberately snagged) .  can they be kept? or given away?  I know port hope is next level craziness lol, but last month I saw the guy next to me bring in 3 fish all hooked in the side, and they were all kept. I tried to look up the rule but was not able to find it.  thanks in advance."

1035205,LostAnotherOne,2018-10-13 16:56:00,956,Oh this post reminds me of the good old times catching carp at Cootes Paradise in Hamilton
1035219,BillM,2018-10-14 14:29:00,17367,That's called flossing.   And no you cannot keep the fish.
1035220,huzzsaba,2018-10-14 15:12:00,884,thanks for all the replies and clarification. In my mind that's what I thought the rule was.
1035224,John Bacon,2018-10-14 17:57:00,3277,"Actually, a flossed fish is legal as long as its hooked in the mouth.  Although, flossins is frowned on, it would be too difficult to enforce a law that attempted to separate fish that were flossed versus fish that bit a lure or bait.  But, hooking it in the body is called snagging; not flossing."
1035225,BillM,2018-10-14 18:18:00,17367,"My definition of snagging, is finishing up your drift with a little bit of a hookset.   Flossing is tossing your rig out there waiting for something to swim into it.  Mouth, tail, ass, whatever.   To me it doesn't matter where it's hooked.  Still flossing."
1035228,grimsbylander,2018-10-14 18:45:00,3016,Correct by definition.
1035231,chris.brock,2018-10-14 23:26:00,4053,"Lead by example Huzz, if you were to foul hook and land one, say in a pretty loud voice ""well I really hoped to keep this one (NOT), but it's fouled hooked so I will put it back"" and let it go."
1035232,huzzsaba,2018-10-14 23:39:00,884,"Thanks John, Bill, Grimsby and Chris for your replies.  Chris, will definitely take your advice!"
1035233,John Bacon,2018-10-14 23:48:00,3277,"No, flossing is specifically getting the fishing line in the fish's mouth.  	Think of flossing your teeth.  The floss goes in one side of your mouth and out the other.  That's where the name comes from.  If the fish swims into your line and ends up with the line going in one side of its mouth and out the other, then the fish has been flossed.  	Any attempt to hook a fish somewhere other than their mouth is snagging regardless of actual technique."
1035234,BillM,2018-10-15 00:29:00,17367,"John, I get ya and I know where the definition came from.   My definition is more of a technique then where the hook ends up"
1035235,porkpie,2018-10-15 00:34:00,2521,"Chinook salmon hooked in the mouth in a river aren't much fun.  Hooked in the side or tail they are nothing but a pain in the can.  My advice is to buy cheap hooks and break off snagged fish.  It's easy enough to line em in the mouth in those shallow troughs at port hope if that's your thing, no reason to snag em, and your back and arms will thank you at the end of the day!"
