After probably 8 or more trips to the west arm and French river over the past 12 years I finally was rewarded. LOL Great weekend and the folks running the lodge are top notch! Riverrat Spinnerbait does it again!   "
1035255,Whopper,2018-10-15 18:11:00,2174,Well done Matt
1035259,Hank Jr,2018-10-15 19:04:00,146,Nice fish the Upper French has been tough for us our last couple trips . See some real hogs just can't get them to eat . Thanks for the report

1035293,Moosebunk,2018-10-16 13:10:00,3970,You have great water in your backyard... but it'd be hard to beat the scenery and excitement of traveling with friends to a northern muskie lodge. Solid reward bud!
