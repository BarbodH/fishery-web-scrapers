I would put Mtl and below out of the picture being 10 pts back. its gonna be a monumental challenge to make that ground up... So make you picks. Who will be out an why?  I am thinking Ottawa and Florida. Reas for  florida is I think Washington will pull up there boots and pull ahead of Florida and not look back, and winnipeg would just be such a cool story so I think they have the motivation... this puts Florida on the outside.... The Sens, I just don't think they can keep anything together, they are slumping at the wrong time of th year. COldest team in the last 10 games with only 3 wins."
665461,davey buoy,2012-02-11 00:36:00,5505, I don't think I can even guess at this point.Far too long to go yet with those teams.
665473,jedimaster,2012-02-11 01:15:00,3472,Very little changes after the trade deadline in terms of who's in and who's out.... A bit early to put money it? Yep... But to make a guess... Whoever drops back now is gonna fade away quickly is my guess.
665489,Gregoire,2012-02-11 02:57:00,1397,The east us pretty even. Anybody in 10th on could go on a run a move way up. Only a leafs fan would count the Habs out. I actually wouldn't mind seeing Montreal miss the playoffs for a few years. Unlike some teams I think they could draft well and manage to not trade away draft picks.

665564,kickingfrog,2012-02-11 16:06:00,8333,"As of today, from a match-up perspective the Leafs have only two teams that would be very difficult to beat in a series:  Boston straight-up Pittsburgh with a healthy Crosby  Doesn't mean I think the Leafs will easily make the play-offs or even win a series. It just means I don't see how they have a chance against those teams.  Predictions are almost pointless, but fun."
