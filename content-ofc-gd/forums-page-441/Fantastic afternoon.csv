Went down to the wall and broke up the ice enough to put a line out in 3-4 ft of water. First fish was in 5 minutes.  There were a few of these  and some of these  and a massive school of these    Caught well over 50 and the smallest were 8"". Kept enough for 2 meals. It were a very busy 3 hours."
665481,Joeytier,2012-02-11 01:47:00,3990,Awesome!  Nothing like a feed o' slabs.  Wish i could say i've gotten into the jumbo pannies like that this winter.
665482,pics,2012-02-11 01:48:00,1268,The big crappie looks to be a white...nice catch
665483,Live2fish85,2012-02-11 01:48:00,1633,Very Nice. Sounds like a great afternoon.
665494,icefisherman,2012-02-11 03:17:00,952,"Great job Bruce. Was there enough ice where you were and how is the ice down to the spot we catch those smelt each year? I'll be suprised if ice is good but who knows....maybe we should go get some crappie instead of smelt this winter?;-) Jordan was asking me about the smelt the other day so I though I should ask you....  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
665496,vinnimon,2012-02-11 03:25:00,2593,"Thats awesome Bruce, esp due to the lack of ice. On another note, you are very considerate man, making them fishies wait for dinner and you leave them something to read"
665505,bigugli,2012-02-11 04:15:00,6138,"The ice I fished was 1/2"" thick. There is no ice at the smelt hole so far."
665506,limeyangler,2012-02-11 04:58:00,5204,Nice slab Bruce!
665510,Garfisher,2012-02-11 05:41:00,229,"Very nice crappie (especially the white crappie), well done on finding a school of them from shore."
665531,crappieperchhunter,2012-02-11 10:59:00,2582,Good job Bruce  You deserved a better day after that disaster of a perching trip last weekend  I hope your giving Robert the gears for not tagging along.
665532,Roy,2012-02-11 11:40:00,13728,"Good stuff, Bruce. Quite the variety on the menu there."
665545,livinisfishin,2012-02-11 14:43:00,661,Great report! That is an excellent variety of fish caught!
