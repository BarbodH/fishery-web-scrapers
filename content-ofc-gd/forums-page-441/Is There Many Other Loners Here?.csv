663769,bushart,2012-02-05 17:35:00,2628,Yes Skip----Warm...Quiet...Peaceful summer days
663778,mercman,2012-02-05 19:08:00,7054,Thats one of my favorite paintings Bush Speaks volumes in it's serenity.
663951,Moosebunk,2012-02-06 06:13:00,3970,"Had heard somewhere that in only 4% of the world can a man be on land and find himself 100 miles or more from a human settlement of sorts.  Anyways... kinda get where you're coming from Art.  It's been hugely important and something I've looked forward to in past years especially, to plan and then get off the grid into the bush.  It's experiences like that, being alone, which have always felt  therapeutic, defining, deeper and inspiring.  When those purposeful escapes are encroached upon by others, oftentimes there can be a sense of loss for that moment.  There's plenty time in our lives given to others during work, play and home-life.  But personally, without alone time (and especially that alone time when getting way out there away from people) I don't feel inspired or tested in the same kind of ways."
663959,bigugli,2012-02-06 07:41:00,6138,"Solitude is , more than anything else, a state of mind. Some of us need to cut ourselves off entirely from the civil world to achieve that state of peace. It can be exhilarating, I must admit. Like going out for that dawn paddle/row knowing you only share the lake with the loon. Not disturbing the serenity with the sputter and whine of an outboard motor. I may not always be able to find places in Niagara without that background noise of civilization, but I do find isolated niches where I am the only soul around. Free to focus my thoughts or empty my mind and drink in my surroundings."
663969,limeyangler,2012-02-06 12:11:00,5204,I need to get away from people so i can have a proper conversation with myself without interuptions!
663974,bushart,2012-02-06 12:51:00,2628,When I'm way off away from people in the bush----it does give the opportunity to collect your thoughts and plans without distractions  Any hunter will tell you---the woods are fairly quiet for the most part when you 1`st walk in---but sit quiet for only a few minutes and it all comes to life again---but for the most part---short of being treed by a bear---they mind their own biz and carry on  Maybe it's the wonder of just watching it all that we enjoy---nature conducting itself as it has always done.  One of my best memories---years ago when I was in a lot better shape---up in the north----I was hunting all morning---walked for hours on a cool fall morn with my pack on my back---remember finding a perfect log pile and eating my lunch----miles and miles away from anyone---just sitting in the sun--it was perfect---and I would recommend this on anyone's bucket list.  And now of course I sometimes think----If I broke my leg--alone back there---how that might have turned out---no cell phones then---not that they'd work there----but I did'nt and it's a perfect memory.  Yep
664144,COUNTRYBOY,2012-02-06 21:39:00,130,  I THINK BEING A FISHING NUT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE FISH. IT HAS TO DO WITH THE SOLITUDE....AMEN
664156,bushart,2012-02-06 22:30:00,2628,Yes CB--wether it's hearing the river run across the rocks or waves lapping on shore---we all need this to nourish our souls
664300,mike rousseau,2012-02-07 03:42:00,4661,Carp fishing is probably my biggest get away... Not far from civilization... But I have a few spots where nobody would find me... Nice ... Quiet... Only noise I hear is carp splashing and the wind blowing... Lots of afternoons in April and may spent napping in my luxury carp chair with the sounds of birds chirping and fish splashing...  Can't wait for April...
664305,Skipper D,2012-02-07 04:02:00,1970,"I know what inland out there that you would be hidding behind . Its ok , i would never disturb you .... just watch out for the red,white and blue Bayliner ..... lol ."
664309,camillj,2012-02-07 04:13:00,1988,"Me .. I thinks ... its not how far away you get physically ... but how far you get away mentally ... had some pretty good solo times right under the QEW on one of my happy places ... with bows, browns, salmon .. and deer ... and not a soul in sight"
665511,Toad Hunter,2012-02-11 05:49:00,261,"wow, I'm only coming up on 30 and feel the same way, I actually just finished reading ""One mans wilderness-the dick preonneke story"" and it almost was enough to bring a tear to my eye by the time I finished his journal entries and his reflections.. i recommend this for anyone who hasn't read it (or heard of it)"
665514,Dabluz,2012-02-11 06:15:00,701, That must be a pretty big creek.  More like a small river?  To me a creek is something that you can almost straddle and has about 1 to 4 feet of water.
665515,Dabluz,2012-02-11 06:32:00,701,"I'm lucky in the fact that I only have to go about 30 km north of Chicoutimi where I live and there are no more cities, towns or villages.....all the way to James Bay.  Yes, if I go north east or north west, I will either end up in Fermont or Chibougamau-Chapais but north of Chicoutimi, there is nothing.  After about 60 km, cottages are rare and there are a few lumber camps and outfitters but there is mostly free land.  I like wilderness camping a lot and I don't have to go very far to be alone for a weekend.  Using my GPS, there are thousands of lakes near the lumber roads and there are no trails to these lakes.  During April and May, I can snowmobile to these lakes and do a bit of ice fishing for brook trout.  I am always alone on these outings because no one I know wants to go.  The fishing is usually fantastic.  During the summer, these lakes are hard to reach because of the rough terrain, fallen trees, heavy bush.  Fishing from shore is impossible because of the trees and brush over-hang the shoreline.  The forest is too dense to portage a canoe.  I like fishing alone.  I even prefer fishing alone.  Next best thing is fishing with my wife.  Yes, a person alone could get into bad trouble when he or she is far in the bush but what better way to die."
665535,bushart,2012-02-11 12:38:00,2628,"That's what my cousin used to tell me Dabluz---""At least you'll die happy"""
663497,Big Cliff,2012-02-04 16:45:00,6899,"You need to live where we do, about the only noises you hear around here are the loons, coyoties, that sort of thing. We are lucky I guess, deer still wander through our yard from time to time and most of the people that live around here are quiet and respectful of each others privacy."
663502,lew,2012-02-04 17:20:00,12766," Same thing over this way Cliff, nice & peaceful with about the only noises coming from the critters wandering around.  Now if I could just get the locals to put rubber tires and those darned buggies goin down the road past my house it'd be even quieter  "
663503,mike rousseau,2012-02-04 17:25:00,4661,i just go icefishing on the sketchiest looking ice i can find...lol... nobody follows me...lol
663504,bushart,2012-02-04 17:33:00,2628,I don't know Lew----he looks pretty rowdy
663511,lew,2012-02-04 18:16:00,12766," Yeah, darned trouble makers"
663515,Tootsie II,2012-02-04 18:51:00,162,"There still are places in Northern Ontario where you can get away from it all if your not afraid to load your gear in a boat and cross a lake of go up or down a river and are willing to rough it a bit. I know I'm going to upset some people, but nothing represents the modern intrusion into the bush to me more than those ""darn"" ATV's. I have no problem with them being used to draw fire wood or water or pull out a moose, but when I see the number of people who let their 10 year olds rip around on them and tear up what were once good walking trails, I see red. There is one old logging road near Timmins where my Dad and I spent many long hours walking together with our dogs in the Fall and I'll bet Dad is spinning in his grave because of what the ATV's have done to it. One of the ironies about this area is that for the years we walked it, we were also wlaking on a gold mine. There is now an operating underground gold mine extracting ore from under that trail. I to am a type of loner, even if my remaining years are limited. Hopefully, Mr. Harper will let me start collecting my OAS this Fall. LOL!"
663516,Blue Lk,2012-02-04 18:58:00,337,"Bush,NWO is still a great place to live. I spent almost the first 40 yrs of my life in Dryden,but could never live in a town/city again. 2 hours in a big city & I have had enough.  This is the deck veiw where I spend my winters.   And this the deck veiw where I spend the other 3 seaons.   Life in the north is Great."
663517,crappieperchhunter,2012-02-04 18:59:00,2582,I'm in Oshawa but am from the country. I am still amazed at how close relatively undisturbed spots are for those that make the effort. It might not be what it used to be...I can't argue with that... but peace and solitude AND good fishing are not to far away...especially if you are lucky enough to be able to sneak out midweek.
663521,bushart,2012-02-04 19:14:00,2628,I hear ya guys  I actually fished Blue Lake in the bay one time--caught a bunch of smallies if I recall  I know it's beauty country---but family reasons pulled us east
663542,bigugli,2012-02-04 19:57:00,6138,"I'd relocate back north in a heartbeat. Sadly, the Mrs wants no part of that, so I'm content where I'm at."
663559,Fishnwire,2012-02-04 20:48:00,983,There have been times I've gone to my camp by myself for 4 or 5 days in a row and never spoken to or seen another human being the whole time.  It's nice to be able to do that but eventually I get lonely and the sound of an approaching quad is something I long for.  Without talk radio on Sirius satellite I'd go nuts.
663594,Oggie,2012-02-05 00:01:00,588,You really have to go deep into the bush and over a few long portages to ENSURE peace and quiet. If you can reach it by boat or atv good luck!! Its weird when there's No noise. Unsettling at first. dan o.
663644,Skipper D,2012-02-05 03:02:00,1970,Perhapes later in life you will find no noise to be your Medicine ...lol
663652,MCTFisher9120,2012-02-05 03:11:00,3761,"This is why I take my few weeks off every year and head out to my Grandmothers out in Eastern Ontario. Even though in the last 3 years people fishing the lakes I do has increased. I can still walk down to my boat on any 5:30am morning and have the small lake to myself, my boat being the first across that day. It's very different here, I got out to Sturgeon lot's last fall and liked the fishing but not the people. You can not have a small boat on that Scugog River coming out of Lindsay or you might die. Gonefishin and I went there a half dozen times last year and every time it's the same thing. Bigger boats and ignorant people. Honestly, in the ""no wake"" or at least speed zones. Those people in the big fiberglass boats fly by every time and yes they watch us turn our boat to face there waves even before they pass us. Still we take the waves and flip the finger every time.   All thing's aside, Kesagami gave me another perspective on this world. Being up north not needing to know a thing in the world but what's for dinner when u get into shore was great. Loved the ""life"" up there.  MTBF    * Dam, I need to get out bass fishing."
663705,bushart,2012-02-05 12:20:00,2628,yes----when numbers of boaters when up--so did the percentage of ones who should not be on the water
663707,Roy,2012-02-05 12:23:00,13728,I think that most if not all fisherfolks have a bit of a loner streak in them at the appropriate times.
663709,bushart,2012-02-05 12:29:00,2628,It's probably because we're more evolved Roy....well that's my story anyway
663711,Roy,2012-02-05 12:34:00,13728, Tell that to the UFC/NHL/NFL/CFL/NASCAR crowd.
663746,nofish4me,2012-02-05 15:13:00,404,"Now, I heard some sort of Canadian expert say, that a person in the US can never be more than 20 miles from a road. He also stated that in Canada that a person could be 100's of miles from a road. Just repeatin' what I heard, from an expert."
663750,bushart,2012-02-05 15:30:00,2628,Maybe they mean the fly in spots???  Oh well maybe we should be happy just to be alive-----and from what I understand is---the only reason I am alive is......  Chuck Norris allows me to live
663751,Oggie,2012-02-05 15:31:00,588, It is already!   It's just getting hard to find the silence anymore so I've become accustomed to the constant NOISE. Dan O.

663764,mercman,2012-02-05 16:57:00,7054,"I have been following this thread for a couple of days. Brought back so many memories from days gone by. I thought i would share a place, where i spent many many summer days, soemtines alone, sometimes with dad. Dad was born and raised in Jones Falls Ontario. His dad worked on the locks there, as a carpenter in the winter, and guided on White and Sand Lakes in the summer. He would trap beaver and Muskrat in the fall and spring. His mom worked at the Kenney Hotel in the laundry room. The Daughter of the owner, i knew her as Miss Kenney, was my kindergarten teacher When i lived in Kingston. I havent been back there in almost 40 years, but the images in my mind are still vivid. I fished Sand and Whitefish Lake with my dad, as a kid.It was then, and still is now, my idea of peace and beauty.I would spend hours sitting at the top of the stone arch dam, looking down at the water leaking for the turbine supply tubes, watching the tree tops swaying in the breeze. Have a look at my idea of heaven on earth. I would love to get back there, and relive all the best of my childhood.Maybe fish some spots that i use to with Dad. Have a look.The place still looks exactly as it did 40 years ago.The Kenney hotel is the building in the background of the 3rd photo. http://www.rideau-info.com/canal/videos/vid-05-jonesfalls.html"
663766,bushart,2012-02-05 17:08:00,2628,"That's Cool Merky-----man I wonder if we knew just how those times would be remembered  Comes up lots in my life  Even called it ""Back To The Farm""  "
663767,Skipper D,2012-02-05 17:11:00,1970,On further obervation of this thread Bushart we can come to the conclusion that cabin fever is at its high with most  urning for those bright days of summer ..........................
663338,bushart,2012-02-03 21:42:00,2628,"Ok....My next b'day I'm going to be 51  Been fishing since I was 6 and hunting since I was 15.  And by practicing these things---one part I always, always treasured-----the ability to get away from rat races and crowds of people.  When I was a kid I used to visit my uncles farms and that was great---heck one still did'nt have hydro and it was fun to go outside and pump water to drink from the well.  But in recent memory---my little hideaways are slowly leaving---Constantly running into all kinds of folks pushing in farther and farther.  It is getting harder these days to just do simple things---I used to be able to walk down some country roads and never see a vehicle---now you need orange not to get hit  The lake I live by---in the summer I have to see if there is yet another tournament going on (which is most summer and fall weekends) because you would'nt get a parking spot  Even in Northwestern Ontario--where you'd think there was enough room-----nope---trophy deer gets shot and people are going in droves. Met a guy from Michigan years ago on the crown and he made out like I was trespassing on his land. etc. etc.  I know the world is changing---and yes--I'm reaching dinosaur status---but I'm just a little sad sometimes to see it go.  Then it's a little compounded when I consider stuff like this by David Suzuki (maybe a board bro can help me again with this link)  K i'm done feelin sorry for myself now.  "
663341,Big Cliff,2012-02-03 21:52:00,6899,"When I lived up in French River many years ago I use to love taking my rifle or fishing rod and just walking off into the bush, never knew where I would end up or when I'd come back out.  There are still many places you can do that sort of thing but you do have to go further North to find them. I'm 66 now and can't quite go for as long or as far as I use to but I still love just going and sitting in my deer stand for hours at a time and watch nature do it's thing."
663344,bushart,2012-02-03 21:57:00,2628,Thanks Cliff and I hear ya---- years ago I remember setting up a spot where I knew this buck was hangin around---took like an hour to walk into--and yup here comes buddy on his 4 wheeler stoppin by wantin to ask me questions  Guess my fault--I should have bought a 4 wheeler to get further away
663346,DRIFTER_016,2012-02-03 22:03:00,10439,"Still plenty of room to get away from it all once you leave the center of the universe that is Ontario.    :tease: I am often out on the land and do not see another soul. Even in the far North you can't completely get away from civilization though. I have been 100's of kms from the nearest town and you can't get away from plane traffic. All you need to do is look up and you can see the contrails of jets and sometimes you can hear them even though they are flying at 35,000 feet."
663348,BillM,2012-02-03 22:08:00,17367,Lots of places to escape even a few mins out of Barrie..
663351,GBW,2012-02-03 22:13:00,8460,I live in the Whitby area and it's brutal out here.  I love the time I do get to go fishing alone or with friends as i just tune out and be...  When it comes to this time of year it's hard to find peace on the ice as the closest ice is Scugog and everyone knows it's a zoo at best.  I would rather sit in 'Sin city' (Sinclair's hut) and fish then go to a b-day party of some sort (beer involved or not!).  I just love to get away and try and clear my mind; fish or no fish.
663357,bushart,2012-02-03 22:56:00,2628,I guess we still can find little spots--my advice----keep it quiet
663364,cynmar,2012-02-03 23:12:00,169,"Just turned 60 and I agree, although with older age comes the ability to zone out and nobody notices. Go to the local lake, find a nice spot with a tree, line with a bobber in the water and ignore everyone. Hearing is going so it's easier."

Ones that I don't have to drive a day to get to!"

663395,asdve23rveavwa,2012-02-04 00:58:00,2690," I hear you on that one.  Small creek within a half hour drive of Kitchener produced a 17 & 16"" speckle trout for me in ""the good old days"".  In fact one creek even closer than that would consistently give up 12"" specks with the odd nice resident rainbow."

663464,Dave Bailey,2012-02-04 13:12:00,1641,"I hear ya. One of the things that killed my first marriage was not just my ex, but her family. To them there always had to be hoards of people around, and the discussions always had to be about their huge family. I have always valued solitude, and when I used to go out on my nature walks on a Sunday afternoon, instead of being at the in'law's place getting all the latest family gossip, they thought I was weird. Some people just cannot understand that there is a great difference between being alone and being lonely. Trekking through the woods with my binoculars and camera made me feel alive and connected to everything around me. Sitting in their living room with half a dozen of them made me the loneliest person in the world."
663467,Skipper D,2012-02-04 13:42:00,1970,"Call me lucky , i grew up with dead silence in the country where we lived . Funny i took a girlfriend there i was dating from Toronto who had never been out of the city , thought it would be a great thing for her to expeirance , we arrived and shut the car off and i aked her to step out and listen ,  i then could'nt get out of the car fast enough to find out what all the screaming was about , there she was with both hands over her ears screaming like mad saying it hurt , can you belive that , silence hurt her ears . I was'nt long getting rid of her i'll tell ya .......... lol . Silence is golden in my books and getting harder to find in this world , but like you say , if you look you can still find small pockets of it here and there . I did a test one time to see just how much noise we live with every day , at the time i live out in the country with dead silence but there was some thting that buzzed in my ears and i wanted to see if i could make it stop and hear complete silence , i got it when i shut the main breaker of in the house and cut all the power off , its surprizing how much noise our houses make . The wife and i vacation every year as many times as we can in the mountains of Quebec just to injoy the silence . Think we're nuts , come with us some time and you be the judge ."
