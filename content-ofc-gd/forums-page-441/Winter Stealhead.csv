Fish was hiding in the deep pools....largest about 8 Lbs....water and air were cold though....I guess it is to be expected in February....but not cold enough to get enough ice on Simcoe....those whities are getting fat for sure....May 15 can't come soon enough )  Few shots from the day....not easy to take pictures with cell phone when you are alone....                    Cheers,  Ice Fisherman"

665114,livinisfishin,2012-02-10 00:09:00,661,"Just curious how do you tell the natural fish from the stocked ones , are the stockers all tagged?"
665193,icefisherman,2012-02-10 03:34:00,952," Depending on the body of water...some are tagged many are with clipped fins....the ones caught this time were all naturals with all fins present.  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
