664853,Tdel,2012-02-09 10:35:00,393,"Several years ago I went out to check the mail on a really cold day in February and couldn't open the lock on our community mail box.  I thought the lock was frozen so I bought some lock de-icer and then tried to heated up the key and free the frozen lock.  No luck what so ever.  So I waited until the weather was a a little above 0C which was about a week later and still no luck. I waited for the ""mailman"" to arrive at the mailbox and asked him for my mail.  He asked me if I was having a problem so I explained to him that I couldn't open my mail box and he said it must be frozen.  He tried to open it and couldn't. He had to use his master key to get the mail out of my box.  I asked him to change my lock and he said he couldn't.  He said I would have to go to the Post Office and let them know why I wanted my lock changed.  I did that and the postmaster told me to just go to the mailbox and wait for the mailman to show each day and ask him to give me my mail until the weather heated up. I told the postmaster that was just nuts. I worked shift work and couldn't always be there waiting for the mailman to show up. The postmaster then told me that I had to contact the mailman and ask him to change the lock. So the next day I spoke to the mailman and explained what the postmaster said. He said he couldn't do it until the postmaster told him to do it. I asked him what kind of flunkies work down there.  Now I am really getting upset when the mailman told me this little nugget.  He said I don't know why there is so many problems here with these mailboxes.  He said a woman down the street was complaining too about her mailbox because she just moved in and wanted the locks changed on her mailbox. She said the keys weren't returned by the person who use to live at that address. He said I changed her lock and gave her the new key to it. She asked him when was the lock on her mailbox going to be changed because the key he gave her did not open the box. He told me he had already changed her lock and didn't know why she was complaining.  When I heard this I told him you must have changed my lock and not hers. He swore up and down he didn't make a mistake. I had to go back to the postmaster and demand that my lock be changed.  It was like talking to people that are housed up on the hill.  Almost two or three weeks later my lock was changed after many trips to the post office, talking to the postmaster, being told that it would be changed and wasn't, etc. etc.etc. After all that, the postman still told me he did not make a mistake. One of the times I was talking to the mailman about my lock he dropped some mail in the slush and picked them up and just threw them on the floor of his van. He didn't even put them in the box.  A couple of months later the mailman knocked on my door to ask me if I could give these multiple packages to my neighbour because he was not home at the time. I did it as a favour for my neigbour. My neigbours are getting my mail and I am getting theirs. Thank God that is only two or three times a year. My mailbox is only used now to receive mail and what I receive is only minimal.  I no longer mail anything. Their last strike was the straw that did it for me.  Oh one other thing .........quite a while back my income tax cheque was stolen. The officer I spoke to said they were investigating the Post Office because there were several Government cheques that did not make it to the proper addressee in town.   Didn't mean to hijack this thread with this lengthy post but this is also a rant I have. I just thought I would share."
664857,Billy Bob,2012-02-09 11:20:00,5865," SO, other then a couple of these small concerns.....are you satisfied with your mail service....  (That's the kind of question they might ask you)"
664900,fishing n autograph,2012-02-09 14:40:00,2540," Yeah its called mischief under and mischief over.... Its never called ""willfull damage"" anymore"
664931,irishfield,2012-02-09 15:48:00,26272," Generally yes.. agreed.. but look up one section 429.. explains what Wilful damage is to cover what 430 says about wilful misconduct causing damage, etc. The RCMP still lay and prosecute as Wiful damage...as recent as 2012.  BTW.. it was an attempt at humour given your position.."
665107,Tdel,2012-02-09 23:41:00,393," They don't talk to me and I don't talk to them.  I am happier that way. I have lived here for 42 years and have never been asked ""Am I satisfied with my mail service.""  By the way the mailman causing all or most of my problems is no longer there. Probably retired or could have been fired ........ who knows.  I don't really care."
665420,Photoz,2012-02-10 22:08:00,792,"As a 25 year letter carrier I could likely tell you (true) stories that would curl your hair about what is expected of us, when we deliver the mail. Right now I'm sitting at home except for 2 hours a day of physio for a knee replacement, caused by someone to dam cheap to fix their front stairs! We have lotsa stuff to walk around, climb over & under out there. First . . . .   what would you consider an acceptible error rate (we ain't perfect) for delivering mail . . .   90%? Or maybe 95%? how about 99%? On and average day, I delivered roughly 1200 letters, 400 larger envelopes and maybe 10 small parcels about 1600 pieces of mail to 425 points of call . . .   if I had a 1% error rate, that would be 16 wrongly delivered! I rarely had any . . .   2 . .   maybe 3 per week. We are out there in -20 weather & +90 degree weather, raging blizzards . . .    downpours where you couldn't see! People leave good ol' 'Rover' to run loose (I carried 'bribes' in my satchel) he wouldn't hurt a fly, yeah h h h. Oh yeah, I had 2.5 hours to sort, tie out, bag & get those 1600 pieces of mail on the delivery truck to take 'em out to my walk. As for wrong addresses, a lot of letters come from other countries . ..  they either have a terrible time spelling street names, or even writing them in English! This is my favourite story though . . . .    I once received a letter 'To My Nana, Mrs. Bernstein North York Canada and the CORRECT POSTAL CODE . . . .  it automatically came to my walk, and Mrs. Bernstein always got me a lovely card at Christmas, I didn't matter there was no money in it, the card musta cost her $10.00 . . . .    no problemo . ... SHE GOT HER BIRTHDAY CARD FROM HER L'IL GRANDAUGHTER in Latvia, and right on time! When I wrecked my knee I had to give up my letter-carrier's job & work inside, sorting mail on the midnight shift. Yes, there are a few REALLY bad apples out on the 'beat' but thousands who are good people, like yourselves, just trying to make a living! There must be THOUSANDS who read this board . . . .  they have all had a chance to relate their postal horror stories in this thread . . . .   how many did? I rest my case! And Big Cliff, your carrier represents far more people than some I'm hearing about!Lovely to hear about!"
665422,irishfield,2012-02-10 22:21:00,26272,At least he got you off your ass and up to the keyboard Steve!!
665437,Photoz,2012-02-10 22:54:00,792,Yeah h h h . . . .    I DO check in and 'skim' most days. The knee is ALMOST as sore now as it was back in mid-November when it was done. I'm startin' to get just a wee bit worried . . . .    the normal time for this is about 5 to 8 weeks?
665438,DRIFTER_016,2012-02-10 22:58:00,10439, I would be going in to see the doc. We have a lady here at work who had hers done not long ago and it's infected and she is going to need to be operated on again.
665456,nofish4me,2012-02-11 00:13:00,404,"I love Canada Post. It's easy for me to get to and the Postmaster is a local person. I'll give my best Canada Post story. Well, it was coming up to Christmas time and the wife has family all across the country. She decides to send everyone a particular, framed (glass in), picture. Well, now I learned along time ago, not to ever criticize her (I've been making my own lunch for over 20 years). Off they all go, there was only one out of five that arrived with broken glass.  They were wrapped with only one layer of bubble wrap, and brown paper. I figure Canada post did a good job! All the courrier companies have their particular boundries, etc.. There is a Purorlator Depot 30 min round trip from my house, but I fall into the zone that takes me 1.5 hour round trip. So, I definetly prefer Canada Post. I, just today, sent out a 1 lb package, that included some paperwork and some Beef Jerky from the Calgary area. I figure the $8.00 it cost me to send it, was money well spent. The feller that gets it won't have to drive 30 min's each way to pick it up at a depot of some sort (since he works away from home and can't answer the door bell).  Just my take on things."
664531,fishing n autograph,2012-02-08 02:26:00,2540,"Ok...so it takes a lot to get me angry......but this takes the cake.  Many of the members on the board know that I'm an autograph collector. I use the postal service all the time and have seen a steady decline in decent service. Before I moved in to my current pkace I had several great letter carriers who I could talk to and who took care of the stuff that was delivered to me.  Since I moved to where I have a communal mail box, I have had letters containing protected photos forced into the small pigeon hole where they become bent and destroyed.  Lately I've noticed things not arriving. Today I found out why. An hour ago (I'm at work) a heavy set man rang my door bell and my wife checked the door but didn't answer. The guy was delivering my mail that was delivered to his house. I could have lost 8 valuable photos.  Not only that, I've been receiving other peoples mail for more than a year.  I don't know who is dropping the ball, but I've placed a ticket to CP, but I doubt that will solve anything....  Ok. I'm done...."
664545,mercman,2012-02-08 03:22:00,7054,And they wonder why people are using the mail less and less. Plus they just increased stamp prices
664546,fishing n autograph,2012-02-08 03:25:00,2540,The price is killin me too lol
664562,NANUK,2012-02-08 04:27:00,797," Same here, I have been getting other people's mail as well, who by the way live on a totally different street about 1 mile away. I wrote ""Delivered to wrong address"" on the envelope and put it back on top of my mail box for the mail carrier to pick it up, well that got him upset and he left a note in my mail box saying (in caps) ""STOP WRITTING ON OTHER PEOPLE'S MAIL, WE ALL MAKE MISTAKES"" I totally get it about being human and making a mistake, but doing it every week, twice a week is not very comforting, makes me wonder how many of my important/personal mail is being delivered to other people. We never had that problem with previous mail carriers, and I am sure they were humen too. Like you, I placed a ticked to CP as well and assured them that I am not in the habit of writting on other people's mail unless it is delivered in my mail box and need to be re directed to their rightfull owner. This has been going on for a couple of years now and not much has improved so far, I still get the wrong mail delivered to me. Hope you have a better luck, please keep us informed with the outcome."
664570,Ice Fishing Ham,2012-02-08 09:37:00,83,"I've had same problems as well and more.  Mail deliver to me from 2 completely different streets with same number. They also get my mail. Now if I get their mail I circle the address in red marker and write “TRY AGAIN” and put it in the mail box at the post office.  One post man would either drop the blue elastics on my drive way or leave them in my mail box. I saved them for a month (17 of them) and went down a saw the post office manager and gave them to him and told him the problem, it stopped.  Now for the best. A friend was staying at the house, the post man delivered the mail as he left he took a  piss on my fence. She called me at work about this, I came home and once again I visited the manager. He didn't believe it so I told him to come and have a look evidence was still on the fence and the yellow snow was the real give away, not to mention his foot prints. He changed his tune at that point and said he would look into it.  It's unfortunate that these things stand out and make the post office look bad. There are many good mail personal but since they do a good job you don't see them. It's only the bad things that make the news."
664571,Billy Bob,2012-02-08 10:37:00,5865,The most famous mailman tells you how to deliver the mail......

664577,spincast,2012-02-08 11:31:00,3279,"When we moved to our new neighbuorhood (six years ago now), CP lost all our mail for 3 weeks. I was in the midst of dealing with my Dad's estate, and of course all the bills and other crap you go through when moving. Contacted CP daily. Useless. I finally contacted the ombudsman, who within 48 hours had the situation rectified. If you dont get satisfaction in your current communications: My link Good luck These days if I have to ship anything of value, I do it via expresspost of courier - then at least we can track it through the system and see where they lost it."
664624,wallyboss,2012-02-08 14:49:00,1095,"I live out of town a bit and last Winter I noticed that some weeks I would receive no mail in my mailbox at all, then the week after I would get a load of mail. One day that I was at home I noticed the mail delivery man show up and I asked him why. He said that he doesn't deliver mail when it has snowed because he doesn't have snow tires on his car. I told him that I follow the rules et out by CP and that I keep the access to my mailbox cleared of snow every morning. But he said that he doesn't even come out when it snows. I reported him to CP and by the next week they had cancelled his contract. I ahve not had any issues ever since."
664633,Big Cliff,2012-02-08 15:04:00,6899,"Well, so far touch wood, we have had excellent service from CP out here, in 11 years I think we might have twice had a piece of mail addressed to someone else stuck in with our mail but I'm sure not going to complain about that.  In fact a couple of weeks ago, the lady that delivers our mail actually came right to the door with a package for me because it said ""do not bend"" and she couldn't get it into the mail box without bending it. She didn't have to do that at all. With that kind of service being the norm, I'm inclined to cut her a little slack if there ever is an issue.  FishnNAutographs, you need to find out what your mail man drives, if he is that careless with the mail he is probably a careless driver too.  Just saying"
664646,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-02-08 15:44:00,0,"quality and care suffers when cutbacks and labour disputes cloud the morale of workers.  i've noticed that my CP delivered packages are taking longer and longer since harper made cutbacks.  that said, i keep a path cleared from my house to my neighbours for the postal guy and my mail is always delivered correctly... haha"

664662,Dozer,2012-02-08 16:59:00,896,"The clown delivering mail around our neighbourhood is no better.  Really, all you have to do is look at the number on the house and match it with the number on the envelope, then, in most cases, you walk up the driveway and place in mailbox.  Common sense isn't so common sense anymore."
664669,Tootsie II,2012-02-08 17:12:00,162,"Unfortunately, and I'm not justifying lousy work, Canada Post has beat their mail contractors over the head so bad the last few years from the point of view of pay rates and working conditions, that many of the contractors who have stuck around just don't give a ""poop"" any more. I know one of them who still does care but he is about ready to tell them to ""shove it"". In our area in Ontario, many contractors who knew their routes and their clients really well aren't even allowed to deliver the mail to them anymore if it only has a R.R # on it. It must have a fire number or other identifier on it."
664681,fishing n autograph,2012-02-08 17:37:00,2540,"I received an ""email"" from CP saying that the ticket has been resolved.  Other than that I have no idea what was done, or what is going to change"
