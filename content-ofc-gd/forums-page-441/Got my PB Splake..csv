Lost another good one at the hole, not great for a whole day out but at least the weather was nice.  Still 2 ices in some parts of the lake, this winter weather is getting ridiculous.  Still having difficulty really nailing them though - I've been out a few times and get the odd bite, but it's nothing like I read about.  Don't know if I'm just hitting the bad days since the setups seem really standard.  Oh yeah, and the dogs got to the tail before I got the camera - fish came out undeformed   "

665459,Joeytier,2012-02-11 00:27:00,3990,"Dude, that's a tank!  You're right about splake fishing not being the slam-fest that some articles/people would have you believe, but you usually end up in a pretty spot while doing it."
665470,BUSTER,2012-02-11 01:12:00,1336,"Nice catch,,I've yet to bag One."
665550,Rod Caster,2012-02-11 15:03:00,5784,"Good one Dan. Nice dark-hued fish there.  That would be my PB as well, had I caught it!"
665664,NAW,2012-02-11 23:53:00,4022,Nice job Dan!  Healthy looking fish.
