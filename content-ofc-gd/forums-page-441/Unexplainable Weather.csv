665132,Sharkbait22,2012-02-10 00:40:00,297,"This weather is so so. I guess it could be worse.  Although I’ve caught fish, I haven’t had a great day yet.  This sunny mild weather just makes me think of end-of-season fishing for whites and lakers. This year looks like a bust though I’m still hopeful I can take a week off near the end if that lake (Simcoe) finally freezes over.  Ended last year on a high note.  Think I have them dialled-in and was really looking forward to a few good days.  Pretty disappointing.  Hope we don’t get yanked around with unseasonably cold weather come March 15th ... a traditional time for steelhead.  Too bad about the sap Sinker.  I hope your prayers come true!"
665134,Rizzo,2012-02-10 00:53:00,4754," ...nah, we paid for it already last year with ridiculous amounts of snow    OH NO NOT SYRUP!!!My annual expenditure on syrup will go from $3 to $5"
665135,12footspringbok,2012-02-10 00:57:00,459, I had a good conversation about this topic with my old barber last week.  I remarked how fast people forgot about extreme winter seasons both hot and cold. He laughed and told me he doesn't argue with customers that keep talking about the warm weather this winter like its something new. LOL He went on to ryme off a bunch of years that were really warm.  I did some interesting reading a while ago about the deep water horizon oil spill messing with the gulf stream and possibly causing extreme weather patterns. Over in Europe right now they are having a crazy cold winter...
665144,Sinker,2012-02-10 01:28:00,8692, You really stretch that ounce of syrop
665156,backbay,2012-02-10 01:58:00,773,":clapping:That's pretty funny! I have the worst spring fever imaginable. It's at least a month ahead of usual, and I seem to think that break-up is just around the corner. Never mind that May 1 isn't getting here any faster.... There's some work to do on my buddy's cottage; I'm hoping we can open early so it's all done before fishing time. Here's hoping!"
665157,ketchenany,2012-02-10 02:01:00,3229,"I have extended family in Rome and they got snow last week, I got an email that 60 km east of Rome where I was born they got two feet, a cold winter was  +4 when I was there. The last time they had a decent snow fall was in 1956, my dad built a snowman for us and then we came here  a few years later, seen it very year since!  I started my snow blower in October, bought a NEW shovel and there they sit! Not an once of gas used.  There is always next year."

665414,Jigger,2012-02-10 21:38:00,1237,"I just keep thinking that ill need to add an extension to the father-in-laws dock. Water levels have been an issue the last few years and without the meltoff, we could be in for even lower levels than weve become accustomed to.  Jet stream also gets my vote."

665441,spincast,2012-02-10 23:04:00,3279,one of those years I guess. Drove by the local strawberry farm today - fresh layer of straw spread out over the fields. Done usually see that till....April?
665450,DRIFTER_016,2012-02-10 23:46:00,10439, Pretty much.
665490,Bob,2012-02-11 02:59:00,370,"One year in the early 80s, the ice was off and I was fishing Elliot Lake on the 15th of April. Mid 90s, we had a spring that didn't see ice out until a couple days before the May long weekend. If it comes early this year, I'll be a happy camper. So will the light of my life, the other day, she suggested we hook up the boat and tow it around for an hour just to feel good."
665491,BillM,2012-02-11 03:01:00,17367,"It's happened before, it will happen again..  Next year when we are getting hammered with -20 temps and 4ft of snow you guys will be missing it, lol!"
665022,Twocoda,2012-02-09 20:42:00,4130,Just wondering of anyone else i wondering WHY we are having such a great winter....do you think its the elnio/ninya effect??? is there any truth the the earth tilting on its axis from the Japan quake last year???? or maybe the radiation from the meltdown of the Japan Nuke Plants.....  What i do know is Im absolutley LOVING it....it feels like spring everyday....Its really hard to believe its Feb!!!!!       
665024,jedimaster,2012-02-09 20:47:00,3472,I don't think anyone included all the scientists actually has the answers. All I know is i am stocking up on Zombie Max ammo just in case the appocolypse is near....   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQWb-5nblx4

665075,Twocoda,2012-02-09 22:41:00,4130," interesting...if the weather does turn back to ""normal"" for this time of year and all the prematures dont make it ....i wonder if this will lead to a cancelation of a hunt in the near future...doubtful though ....cuz there are still way too many geese around"
665077,Twocoda,2012-02-09 22:43:00,4130, my neighbour is 89 years old and he has never seen anything like this in his lifetime for this area...
665080,solopaddler,2012-02-09 22:50:00,8605,"Being a weather guy these things are cyclical. I can show you similar snowfall amounts and mild temps from eons ago.  Don't think El Nino is a factor this year. More of an El Nada this year. Neutral on that front.  I believe Mr. Rice is correct in that we're being heavily influenced by the jet stream.  My personal opinion is we'll pay for this winter next year. Warmer surface temps in the great lakes will spawn some vicious lake effect snow. Enjoy it while it lasts LOL!  People that live in traditional snowbelt areas that don't own a snowblower yet, consider grabbing one now, it's a buyers market."
665081,lew,2012-02-09 22:51:00,12766,"Whatever's causing this weather, I like it.  I was out in the driveway this afternoon and was actually standing in mud, and that's lots better than snow & ice"
665085,Twocoda,2012-02-09 22:55:00,4130, i was thinking mother nature was paying us back with this for the last two years...showing a little mercy....i could definatly get used to this type of winter...

665100,Sinker,2012-02-09 23:32:00,8692,"You guys who think this weather is great, are going to eat those words at some point. Its supposed to be winter, not spring. The sap is running in our sugar bush every day. I gotta get my ass in gear and get the gear out before I miss the best part of the run!! Its crazy! Geese are migrating, and some are sitting on nests....whats going to happen when the temps turn cold?? Its gotta have a negative effect on wildlife somehow. I don't like it, and I hope this nice weather goes away and doesn't come back till mid april!!!  I pray every night for -20 temps and 3 ft of snow!!!!   S."
665103,Twocoda,2012-02-09 23:39:00,4130,i read an article the other day about the low yeild of syrup that is expected because of this weather...syrup is going to skyrocket in price....Alberta is already preparing for losses for the farmers due to the lack of snow out there...i wonder if the vegetarians are going to be forced to eat meat with no veggies to be had...of course im joking ....
665108,bigugli,2012-02-09 23:41:00,6138,"Warm winters like this happen. In the early 80's we had a few wimp winters. No snow til February, very little safe ice, 1/2 the HCSA trails were closed. A Minden dogsled derby, or 2, that trucked snow in from Quebec. 65F on XMas 83 in the Sault,..... I also remember freak snowstorms in May. Most recent was 2 years back in Orillia. Extremes happen, what is different is the severity and extended time frames."
