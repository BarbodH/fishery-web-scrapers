We normally fish sturgeon lake and stay at Fish n Rest but we wanted to try something else this year. We were thinking either scugog, rice, buckhorn or pigeon lake.  Can any of you guys recommend a good place with at least half decent cottages on the lake? Websites, phone numbers or any other information would be great.  Thanks."
