665063,irishfield,2012-02-09 22:16:00,26272,Was in Walmart today buying up the rest of their old style 5 gallon fuel cans and while browsing the sports section found what is called an NBA 3 in 1 Carry Sack. $7.98 .. fits the power head very nicely and it's breathable so the fuel fumes won't be an issue.
665101,Sinker,2012-02-09 23:35:00,8692,The power head for my auger is snuggled deep in side my floater suit......doesn't even need gas....no fumes....and always starts on the first try! Super light to carry around too!!  S.
665102,irishfield,2012-02-09 23:37:00,26272,  Oh.. it needs gas Shayne... just a totally different octane!!
665105,DRIFTER_016,2012-02-09 23:40:00,10439,  And the fumes can be horrible depending on the fuel used!!!
665129,Tom McCutcheon,2012-02-10 00:38:00,627,Are you saying his catalytic converter needs work?
665140,cheaptackle,2012-02-10 01:12:00,849,Was a catalytic converter available or does it run on leaded?  Michael
665142,Sinker,2012-02-10 01:23:00,8692,"Come on, you guys all know the smell NEVER gets out of your floater suit........and if it does....you need to inhale deeper  S."
665215,Ice Fishing Ham,2012-02-10 09:34:00,83,"Good idea Irishfield, I'll check Walmart today. A few years ago I stocked up on the old style gas cans as well. They new ones are slow."
665220,wormdunker,2012-02-10 10:38:00,1711,Thanx for the info.  I want to get one cause sometimes gas/oil blows back on me as I'm driving my ATV & stained my floater suit.  My auger is mounted on the front of my machine
