665678,Spouph,2012-02-12 01:13:00,115,"For the most part I have been doing well for eye's this hard water season, but the last two weeks I have had eye's on camera eyeballing my minnow but not taking.  It is frustrating, so I drove all across the lake to find anyone that was still in their huts fishing to find out their all having the same slow down which is normal.  However one guy said that the walleye are losing their teeth.  He seemed dead serious so I did not call shananigins just smile and said really.  I have never heard of walleye dropping their teeth, so I wondeer if there is any truth to it.  It would explain the slowdown, on every walleye lake that I have fished.  I have always believed the slow down to be from a lack of oxygen because of the weeds decomposing, which happens on scugogg and low light conditions from snow pack, but not from the tooth ferry.   let me know what you think"
665679,Roy,2012-02-12 01:14:00,13728,Depends on the hookset.

665739,Twocoda,2012-02-12 03:19:00,4130,usually happens while they are learning to walk....
665742,Frank,2012-02-12 03:30:00,74," Hahaha!!  Although the quoted post was hilarious and I ALMOST spit beer on my laptop, I am so gullible and would have probably believed that walleye are losing their teeth until I got home to google questions like crazy."
665765,mercman,2012-02-12 04:55:00,7054,i am totally verklempt
665777,Spouph,2012-02-12 11:16:00,115,"I got thinking that mabey there is somthing to this after all.  What about a softening or shedding like a snake, not actually loosing thier teeth but a period when the teeth are growing, mabey those eye's have a sore mouth.  It seems far fetched because their mouth are so tough.  But the timing is right to have growth after a month of active feeding.  That old french man sure got me thinking.  Help me get to the bottom of this if anybody knows any one who could answer this.  If you catch an eye check the mouth ot pretty good wiggle one of the teeth and see if it says ouch.  lol."
665779,Spouph,2012-02-12 11:21:00,115,  over come with emoition........ you made me look it up.  this is my new word of the week.
665791,mike rousseau,2012-02-12 12:59:00,4661,We got walleye last night with plenty of   strong teeth...
665799,Billy Bob,2012-02-12 13:58:00,5865,No....they don't lose their teeth....but I know MANY that lost their fillets and cheeks....
665807,kickingfrog,2012-02-12 14:23:00,8333,You'll hear the same thing about pike in the summer. Pure Bunk.
665809,Pikeslayer8,2012-02-12 14:41:00,336,"This is the time of year when walleye's mouths are very sensitive.  That's why I pre-chew my bait a bit before putting on a hook.  The best are a good saltie.  Just a few good chomps are all ya need to properly tenderize your bait.   Now, don't try to use a blender as its very hard to get on a hook.  Catch a goby, just a few chomps will turn it from a round head to a mush-head goby.  Leeches are the best to pre-chew as they are much tougher in consistency.  However, just hate it when my wife says to me ""Is that licorice in your teeth or are ya just happy to see me""."
665873,mercman,2012-02-12 20:25:00,7054,"  Between you and Rizzo, yer gonna kill me from laffing"
665874,Pikeslayer8,2012-02-12 20:49:00,336, I realize their are a lot of heavy hearts around here and mine is no different.  Sometimes it is good to smile and laugh.
665891,Spouph,2012-02-12 22:03:00,115,"Unbelievable it worked, I pre chewed my bait and son of a gun the walleye were taking it.  Actually I just used dew worms on a jig and slowed it down and got mid day deep eye's to bite.  Funny  though I did check out their mouths.  Surprisingly no cavities."
665892,Pikeslayer8,2012-02-12 22:09:00,336, Now that's funny. One question though.  How did ya pre chew them dew worms with just the one tooth?
665893,Spouph,2012-02-12 22:12:00,115," a lotta gummin, and 12 at a time, helps if you leave a bit of dirt, texture"
665895,Pikeslayer8,2012-02-12 22:17:00,336," Ok,  Ok you win!  I've got coffee streaming outta my nose. Thanks for the laughs, Spouph"
665901,Whitespinnerbait,2012-02-12 22:44:00,2038,"Walleye will start losing there teeth, when Chickens start losing there lips  :blink:"
665919,Spouph,2012-02-12 23:40:00,115,"  I can see it now, 10 cent buffalo chicken lip nights at the local pub."
665921,Billy Bob,2012-02-12 23:42:00,5865, DAMN....how many time to I have to say it....BUFFALO'S Don't have WINGS....
665925,skeeter,2012-02-12 23:53:00,1907,Now I know the secret!!! I'm going to the dollar store to buy some teething rings so I can catch them damn walleye!!!  :tease:
665927,SirCranksalot,2012-02-13 00:01:00,3291," Yeah, they got 'em the same time chicken got balls!(Chicken balls---now there's an oxymoron if there ever was one!)   "
