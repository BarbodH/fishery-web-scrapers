665527,hawk-eye,2012-02-11 08:20:00,141,Ive got a mid 80's aluminum with a mid 80's 40hp evinrude that is in need of a new steering control. Just wondering what your thoughts are on Rack and Pinion vs Rotarysystems.  Ive been shopping arround for a new one and found that the racks and rotary systems are about the same price. Is one better than the other or is it a personal preferance thing? Im just not sure if Im missing out on something?  Input is apreciated  Thanks

The rotaries take up less room behind the dash but the non no feed back ones tend to turn by themselves when idling and you let go of the sterring wheel. The NFB unit actually has a built in clutch that holds your course while you are setting lines, dropping your down riggers etc. I have the Safe-T II but they make nother rotary and a rack and pinion unit too.  <iframe width=""420"" height=""315"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/w4B0eSHiIzM"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>"
