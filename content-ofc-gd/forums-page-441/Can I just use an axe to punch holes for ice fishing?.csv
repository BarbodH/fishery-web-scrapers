665629,Weeds,2012-02-11 20:50:00,782,"I'd planned on doing a little ice fishing tomorrow on Chemong most likely; probably close to the causeway where I've seen some huts. I've just noticed that my two piece auger is messed up, the handle is squashed and the 2 pieces won't thread together.  I've got a firemans axe, axe blade on one side and pick on the other.  Providing the ice is not overly thick (or thin) I should be ok, no? Considering this will be my only outing of the season I don't really want to spring for a new auger. Thanks"
665632,Gerritt,2012-02-11 20:54:00,6129,should be fine... why not look for old holes.. and bust them open to make your life easier.
665633,davey buoy,2012-02-11 20:57:00,5505," I would think that the rough edges could cut your line,but if you make the hole big enough that shouldn't even give you a problem,have a great day!"
665647,bare foot wader,2012-02-11 22:04:00,1354,"I grew up using a hatchet my first few times ice fishing...it works for sure, takes a bit longer and not as pretty...the edges wont hurt your line"
665651,Raf,2012-02-11 22:31:00,3495,attach a lanyard to the axe and arm.. i could see it easily slipping into the depths.
665653,Fisherman,2012-02-11 22:42:00,7201,You could also make like Rumpelstiltskin and stomp a hole in the ice..
665661,danc,2012-02-11 23:36:00,4677,Have a look at limeyanglers recent post.
665662,paul_614,2012-02-11 23:49:00,168,"Just remember, as soon as you break through the bottom, the hole will fill with water. Be prepared to get wet getting the rest open."
665665,Billy Bob,2012-02-11 23:55:00,5865,"You can virtually use whatever you want to make a hole in the ice....  But remember what Forrest kept saying.....""Stupid is as Stupid does""...."

665670,Rizzo,2012-02-12 00:23:00,4754,"drink lots of tea, coffee and coke then go out to the lake..."
665672,ckrb2007,2012-02-12 00:31:00,449,Ask the clown who keeps chopping 2'X2' holes around shanty bay and not marking them. Buddy is out there every day working like Paul Bunyan. There's my rant for the day.
665677,hhpeter,2012-02-12 01:07:00,6," hahaha saw him a few times this week ....he's making a hole every 30 minutes, hard working guy for sure...."
665684,Dutch,2012-02-12 01:30:00,831,Use the holes from the 3 vehicles that have gone through the last couple of days.
665712,sleepjigging,2012-02-12 02:34:00,207,No. It's a ridiculously wet and messy affair. The final hole will only be 1-2 inches wide.  Personal experience.  Jiggy
665773,fishing,2012-02-12 07:39:00,167,"I will use old holes or ask someone else drill me a hole or two.  If use an axe, near the end I will bring a hammer to hit the axe so the water will not get me. I may also bring a shovel with me to make the final hole bigger."
665786,Fish Farmer,2012-02-12 12:16:00,2234, So that was your hole I was fishing in the other day and I washed my coffee cup out in it
665801,Billy Bob,2012-02-12 14:04:00,5865,"Best thing to do is tell a little lie.......go to wherever you're going to fish and ask another angler with a auger if you can use it saying, I forgot mine and I drove a long ways and still would like to fish....now when you do this, look for a guy with a new POWER AUGER...."
665822,pics,2012-02-12 15:14:00,1268,"Thats how I got started with ice fishing...just remember though, if you must chop with an axe do it away from other fishermen....nothing more irritating than thump,thump,thump......"
665872,mercman,2012-02-12 20:21:00,7054,  Ya silly little man!!!!
665885,Weeds,2012-02-12 21:46:00,782,"Thanks for all the replies. Axe worked pretty well, opened up a few old holes as suggested. I was surprised at the thickness of the ice, looked close to 12 inches. Initially nobody else was out there to irritate; was damn cold."
665907,crappieperchhunter,2012-02-12 23:21:00,2582, Exactly   My folks had a cottage  with no water. We took our own water for drinking but used lake water for doing dishes and having a shower. Had an old Irish Spring commercial like shower outside...it was awesome. Anyway chopping a hole in the ice to get water was a huge PITA and that was only to make a little hole to get potable water. A hole big enough for fishing out of would be one sweaty slushy wet chore and I would not wish it on my worse enemy. If you do give it a try Raf's idea about a lanyard tie off would be a very good idea.
