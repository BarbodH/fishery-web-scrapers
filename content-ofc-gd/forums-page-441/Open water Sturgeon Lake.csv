664901,Big Cliff,2012-02-09 14:43:00,6899,"Where the Scugog River enters into Sturgeon Lake has just opened up in the last couple of days, that is several weeks ahead of the normal. Last week there were cars driving around out there. I have a feeling this could be the earliest ice out we have had in the eleven years we've been living here. Anyone venturing up this way, please be careful. Where there was ice one day, there is open water the next."
664905,ecmilley,2012-02-09 14:50:00,2163,"thanks for the warning cliff, i am guessing your talking about where it comes through the channel between the airport and snug?"
664927,Big Cliff,2012-02-09 15:27:00,6899,All the way down to Lunge Haven and then some!
665123,captpierre,2012-02-10 00:26:00,2521,Dropped in at the cottage northeast arm of Pigeon.  All iced up.  No huts seen.  Water levels down a foot from the fall.  Gagnon Narrows wide open for about a km.  Same at Buckhorn.
665131,Rizzo,2012-02-10 00:40:00,4754, ...she ain't over yet (but I think you're right)
665143,Sinker,2012-02-10 01:25:00,8692,Any open launches
665230,Big Cliff,2012-02-10 12:38:00,6899,I wouldn't be surprised if the one in Lindsay is open.
665348,manjo39,2012-02-10 18:00:00,354,Thanks for the update Cliff.  We're heading up this weekend and will heed the warning.
665400,Big Cliff,2012-02-10 20:42:00,6899,Just heard today that two guys were in their ice hut when it broke through the ice. Fortunatly they got out ok. Seems they opened up the locks in Lindsay allowing a lot of water to flow down the river which undermined the ice where their hut was. They were driving cars and truck out there just a couple of days before that.
665451,lew,2012-02-10 23:49:00,12766,Heard on the Peterboro news earlier today that a pick-up went thru the ice on Chemong up near Curve Lake last night but it sounds like they got out OK.
665540,Rizzo,2012-02-11 14:03:00,4754,"I bet that open water is gone this morning, man is it cccoooooolllldddd out there"
665542,Sinker,2012-02-11 14:11:00,8692,"Yeah, probably skimmed over enough to gather a skiff of snow, so now its even more dangerous  Anyone want to bet someone goes thru it over the weekend??  S."
665551,Big Cliff,2012-02-11 15:08:00,6899," Two days of this cold and then back above normal again for a couple of weeks at least. Even the nights aren't getting (apart from last night and tonight) anywhare near as cold as they usually do for this time of the year.  Last year at this time we had a good 24"" of ice out in front of our place, this year might be 14"" and that is with no snow cover at all."
665575,Rizzo,2012-02-11 16:49:00,4754,ya this stuff is scary. Guys who don't know it was open 2 days ago will be in for a dangerous surprise
665658,Big Cliff,2012-02-11 22:51:00,6899,"That is why I wanted to post it on here, if it even saves one person from going through it will be worth the time."
665669,Rizzo,2012-02-12 00:21:00,4754,"Good call Cliff. There's a spot I want to fish next week-end, I went first thing this morning to have a look...open water. Wouldn't surprise me one bit after the next 2 days its frozen next week-end, so I wanted to see today where it was at. Definitely not going there next Saturday!"
