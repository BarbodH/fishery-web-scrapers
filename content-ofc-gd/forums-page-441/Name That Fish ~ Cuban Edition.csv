You must have hit a good window with the tides or something, cool! Ah, don't worry about the line and lure, I have more of those somewhere and I hardly used them. Glad to see you get some enjoyement with those saltwater Rapalas... While it lasted lol"
665172,Cudz,2012-02-10 02:46:00,2652,"Hey Mike.  Nice fish.  A grouper for sure.  I don't want to hijack this thread but take a look at this old post I made. http://ontariofishingcommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=34796&st=0&p=369361&hl=hamour&fromsearch=1entry369361  Those grouper I used to catch are called Tawina Grouper and they look very similar. Their local name in Abu Dhabi and Dubai is Hamour.  Awesome tasting fish.  Very mild and very white meat.  Melt in your mouth.  Would have been nice to have some grilled grouper for sure!  They are like tanks.  I have had them hit the line, pull about 50 yards and just sit in a hole at the bottom of the sea without a hope of pulling them out with my 30 pound test."
665177,Dutch,2012-02-10 02:52:00,831,"Whatever kind of grouper that is, it's a hawg.  Thanks for sharing."
665435,Paulus,2012-02-10 22:48:00,522,"MIKE! DID YOU BRING SOME CIGARS FOR ME??? NO???!?!    Ha! But maybe you'll accept one the next time I offer  Dude, I took a long shot and googled ""fishing grouper in cuba,"" and I came up with this - among other things:  http://fishing.solwayscuba.com  According to the chart at the bottom, it may have been a red grouper.  But I also ran into this, on another forum, that talks about yellowfin grouper and it seems even more likely, especially since it hints at big variations in colour:  http://www.tribenwater.com/forums/tribenwater-marine-field-guide/199-know-your-groupers.html#post442  Beauty fish, regardless!  p.-"
665692,The Urban Fisherman,2012-02-12 01:52:00,2050,Awesome fish and awesome trip!!! Thanks for the post man.. Someday maybe!  I was going to say it looks like a colorful version of the baby Goliath grouper we were catching in Florida.. But everybody else beat me to it! Good work!
665823,Moosebunk,2012-02-12 15:17:00,3970,"Hey... don't know how I missed this one!!!  Gotta say Mikey, it's not everday vacationers down that way with packed rods even catch a fish, let alone some greats like that grouper and bones.  But I don't know how you could do it.... cause those cigars along with some Montezuma's Revenge woulda had me swirling it outta both ends all week. lol.   I did eyeball Joanne's bum for just a second too... sorry, but you put it there. lol."
662519,solopaddler,2012-02-01 18:06:00,8605,"As many of you know I recently spent a week in Cuba with the family. Overall a great trip, fishing was decent and a Monte Cristo #5 with a double shot of 10 year old Havana Club is pretty hard to beat.  I had some decent success on small bones and one surprise permit wading some nearby flats and casting small jigs. As well there was a nearby boardwalk that spanned the entrance to a large salwater lagoon. We caught a multitude of small colorful scrappy little fish using mostly bait under a float.  But two fish stand out above all, one was caught and one was lost. Both were hooked right off the beach amazingly enough and I drew quite a crowd of gawkers both times.  First fish hit hard and almost spooled me. Ultimately I was successful landing it, Joanne snapped a couple of quick pic's and back she went.       Can anyone tell me what it is? A Cuban lifeguard tried in broken english but the translation was difficult.  He did say some people will keep these fish to eat but that they could be poisonous.  He said they feed the fish to their goats or dogs first. If the animals eat the fish then it's dinner time LOL!  About an hour later I hooked a second fish that hit like a freight train and spooled me. Never did see the thing. It took 300yds of 40lb braid and was gone.  Pretty amazing (Sorry Aaron I lost your lure and all the line you lent me LOL!)   Here's a few more pic's from the trip just for fun.   Brendan fishing on the boardwalk    Nearby point I had some pretty good success fishing off    Beach   Joanne and Brendan relaxing together by the pool   Me on the beach with cigar and rum. "
662521,adempsey,2012-02-01 18:09:00,1498,"Nice trip!  Makes me rethink heading south instead of north all the time.  My wife would probably prefer that - although, that means she would be coming with me, might need to really ponder on that one!  I would guess that fish is a Yellowfin Grouper.  Definitely a grouper of some sort.  Cheers!"
662523,asdve23rveavwa,2012-02-01 18:14:00,2690,"Sounds like a good time, Mike.  Fishing,and, fun in the sun...doesn't get much better."
662525,quickme,2012-02-01 18:17:00,261,i think its a strawberry grouper..  Went last summer and didn't have the same Luck.  looked like a really good time!
662526,Jds63,2012-02-01 18:19:00,1365,"good to see some sun again ... you are a man of many fish, Mike !!!!"
662554,Pikeslayer8,2012-02-01 19:33:00,336,"So, Solo is on the beach drawin a crowd again!  Anybody suprized?   Far as the fish is concerned...............Cuban Missile Crisis......Part Deux.  What a tank!  As an American, man, do we have a screwed up position on Cuba.  Thanks for sharing."
662555,Spiel,2012-02-01 19:39:00,9065,"Looks like a good time Mike.     I was going to say the same thing as FishLogic, looks just like the 45lb Yellowfin Grouper my Uncle had mounted. Not toxic to the best of my knowledge."
662560,Harrison,2012-02-01 19:52:00,2202,"Very Jealous Mike, looks like a great time.  As for the fish name, I'd take a guess, but my Spanish is very limited and I doubt it is called a ""Cervesa Senor"""
662561,DRIFTER_016,2012-02-01 19:53:00,10439, They can contain paralytic shell fish toxin due to their diet.
662569,Spiel,2012-02-01 20:18:00,9065,"  Thanks Dave. I knew that Grouper themselves were not a toxic/poisonous species so I Googled your response, makes sense, thank you.   One of the links I perused....  http://www.doh.wa.gov/ehp/sf/pubs/pspfactsheet.htm"
662583,BillM,2012-02-01 21:23:00,17367,Spotted grouper is my guess.
662592,johnnyb,2012-02-01 21:41:00,3413,Sweeeeet vacay!  I was kickin' myself for not bringing the gear to Cuba a few years ago....but the Cohibans soothed me
662599,Rizzo,2012-02-01 21:50:00,4754,"man do I miss ocean fishing. The power of the fish make a smallmouth bass look like a pansy. I once hooked a sailfish about 100 feet from the boat. Mate told me I've got a 45 minute fight on my hands. Didn't believe it until the thing was hundreds of feet away in a matter of seconds. Next 30 minutes was earn a foot, give back 11 inches...by the time I finally got it to the boat I was sooooo done with it!"
662603,solopaddler,2012-02-01 21:55:00,8605,"So it's either a Strawberry, Yellowfin or Spotted Grouper or possibly a ""Cervesa Senor"".  There was a large, loud Italian tourist nearby who said ""Ayyy...whassa da beeeg deal? Eees just a beeg oogly feesh!!   (When the Cuban explained how the fish could be toxic all I could think of was Homer Simpson and puffer fish LOL!)"
662621,rhare,2012-02-01 23:10:00,387,love it!  can't wait to get back myself
662643,ccmtcanada,2012-02-02 00:19:00,7971,That solo pose seems to work with all fish!!  Looked like a fantastic time Mike!!!
662688,richyb,2012-02-02 01:50:00,774,Hey thats the same place I was in december. I was standing on that blue bridge kicking myself in the arse for not taking a rod. I did the deep sea fishing tho and got a dorado. What part of the beach did you get that big guy ? I was eyeing up those rocks off the lookout point and figured that would be a good spot.
662701,Live2fish85,2012-02-02 02:06:00,1633,Awesome report as usual. That fish is a beast.  Also sounds nice drinking all that rum and relaxing.
662702,spinnerdoc,2012-02-02 02:12:00,556,"They beat me to it, but I'd say some kind of grouper. Looks like a great trip Mike. Been to Cuba once at Varadero, to my dismay I did not bring a fishing rod, the wife would've killed me if I  had"
662709,solopaddler,2012-02-02 02:20:00,8605,  HA! Go figure eh? I was right at the very end near the rocks. The fish took me for a bit of a walk down the beach through a bunch of swimmers. Totally freaked everyone out.  A few times I paid the 3 pesos or whatever it was to gain access to the hiking trails on the point. One trail lead to a really deadly spot on the other side that had deep water right off shore.
662741,4x4bassin,2012-02-02 03:24:00,1025,"Looks like a good time Mike , is that the beach at Luna Y Mares, Holguin ,it sure looks like it. I have been there several times and have always seen people fishing around that rocky point. I have walked around there and it sure looked good for fishing,I always wondered what if I brought down a rod ,well by your report I guess I will bring one down with me next time, if i'm allowed Too bad you didn't get that big one in , i'm sure you will be thinking about that fish for a long time !"
662760,corvette1,2012-02-02 04:30:00,1765,"congrats mike on your trip, looks like every one had great time"
662779,limeyangler,2012-02-02 07:16:00,5204,I was gonna say grouper too.  Great pics Mike...looks like heaven!  That little point you had succes from looks awesome...brings back memories of my Antigua trips.
662791,Musky or Specks,2012-02-02 11:34:00,2710,Looks like a great time Mike. Thinking of going to Key West next christmas with my son for some cuda fishing.
