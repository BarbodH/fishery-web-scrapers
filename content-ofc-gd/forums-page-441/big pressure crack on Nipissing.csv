""As you can see in one of the pics the ridge is inverted leaving a pond that could swallow a truck,"" Kervin writes. ""The crack has surface water most of the length.""  Another pressure crack runs north from Lonely Island and is about 15 feet high.  Illustrating the height of the crack is Kervin's fishing partner Kerry Elliott.  ———  Nugget.ca will update this story with comments from the OPP."
