Last year was the first year, and despite being held on Superbowl weekend, and a blizzard, it was still a good show. Might be worth the drive for the musky nuts on here as it is far closer than the shows in Milwaukee and Chicago (which are also awesome shows by the way). It's in Monroe, Michigan which is about 40 minutes from the Ambassador bridge southward. Directions are on their site www.michiganmuskyshow.com"
