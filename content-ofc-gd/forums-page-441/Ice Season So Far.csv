664079,trapshooter,2012-02-06 18:18:00,1234,"Been slacking with reports this season so it's time I got caught up.  So far, a great season on the ice.  Started on Nov 26th with first ice specs.   Around the same time our splake lake firms up and we're on the ice chasing them.   Next up, Lac Seul walleye!   Here's my buddy with a beauty!   More walleye..       My favourite fish to chase in the winter though are lake trout.  Here's a few beauties that me and my buddies have caught.                A few other species that come up the hole from time to time...  Couple humpback whitefish.  Colours couldn't be any more different from these 2 fish caught from different lakes.      Couple big pike too!      Got into 1 school of smallies as well.  Season open year round in NW Ontario!!   That Rattlin' Flyer Spoon has been my go-to bait this winter.  Caught everything on it... walleye, lakers, whitefish, bass, pike.  Looking forward to lots more winter here in the NW."
