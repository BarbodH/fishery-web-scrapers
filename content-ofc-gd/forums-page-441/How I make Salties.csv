661741,fish_fishburn,2012-01-29 19:42:00,1311,"I usually do about 10 dozen at a time. I just dump em in a large ziplock bag and add lots of coarse sea salt. After about 6 hours I drain off all the liquid and then add some more fresh salt to them and store in te fridge. The salt extracts any liquid from them so I like to pour it off then they dry out really nice. No rocket science here fellas, easier to make then a peanut butter sandwich. Been doing it this way for years, works good for big sucker minnows as well."

A much smaller fish probably only 0.1 mg per day & do not use salt at the dinner table.  I explained to the doctor about the amount of salt in a bottle of beer, he threw his hands in the air & left!! HA HA"
662311,fishermccann,2012-01-31 22:07:00,655,Only  120 minnows allowed in possesion.
662417,Dabluz,2012-02-01 05:12:00,701,"I've tried salted and unsalted smelt and have had better luck with unsalted smelt.  I freeze the smelt by placing them on a large flat plastic tray....not touching one another.  I place the tray in the freezer and about 1 hour later, the smelt are frozen hard.  I then place them in a plastic bag and then back in the freezer.  The smelt remain separated and it's easy to to take the number of smelt you want to use.  I admit that when I added the salt, I almost immediately put the smelt in the freezer.  Maybe I should have left the smelt in the frig for a day or two before freezing them and therefore let the salt penetrate more into the smelt."
662477,Billy Bob,2012-02-01 15:46:00,5865, Come on....are you telling me they have someone counting your minnows while you are fishing.....  120 is a lot though..
665442,Leecher,2012-02-10 23:11:00,7832,Sorry for the pics being removed... got Photobucket warnings about reaching bandwith quota and to go pro    The hits weren't even from this site   never going to pay to host my pics anywhere on the web   Keep us posted of your results!!!   Been doing my version for the longuest time too and works for me   Not in Québec   The reason I use wax paper... minnows don't stick to it
665446,zenon11,2012-02-10 23:27:00,75," How long does it take for the salties to be ready? Just a few days or 3 weeks?  Thanks for the recipe, I'm definitely going to try it out!"
665447,Leecher,2012-02-10 23:29:00,7832, Not long... overnight in the freezer and your good to go
660941,Leecher,2012-01-27 03:02:00,7832,"Just thought I'd share how I make them since I had to do a batch tonight   All you need is sheets of wax paper, pickling salt, ziploc bag and minnows.  First cut sheets of wax paper into 8"" to 10"" wide, stagger 4 to 6 minnows in the middle    Cover them with salt and don't be shy    Fold the paper over them and each side and place into ziploc bag    Make sure to remove air as much as possible from the bag and place into the freezer and that's it your done  When your ready to go fishing, take as many as you want... when you return, any left over can be place back into the freezer no problems  Tight lines Leechman"
660951,NAW,2012-01-27 03:33:00,4022,"Thanks for posting.  I've been messing around with Salties for the past few years, and haven't got it just right yet.  I'm gunna do it your way from now on!"
660973,manitoubass2,2012-01-27 05:28:00,11391,such a good idea!  I'm def. doing this  Thank you
660984,beginner,2012-01-27 07:25:00,542,"I havent try this yet, but thus this salties applied to smelt?? I have smelt in the freezer that I got from smelt fishing last spring... and which species do I used this from?? pike, laker or whitie?  thnks bfisher"
660997,wormdunker,2012-01-27 10:44:00,1711,"I've used this method as well.  I then break them up into smaller pieces to chum a hole.  This does work while perchin.  I chum a hole with a few salties & shortly afterward the bite is on.  ""Hold on with both hands"""
661000,Billy Bob,2012-01-27 10:49:00,5865,When I had a bait shop years ago I would just dry them off on newspaper (paper towels add up) and then salt them with non iodine salt and bag them...we never froze them....they are preserved already with the salt....freezing them seems to make them mushy....try NOT freezing them and you will see they hold up better and for a LONG time.  But we did store them in the frig...
661019,Hoppy,2012-01-27 12:29:00,95,my question is why salt them at all? this was done back in the day so they wouldn't rot without freezing them. do fish like the salt or something? i just freeze mine for chumming salt free.
661057,Homer Is King,2012-01-27 14:45:00,305,Thanks for the info.  That's a nice tidy technique.  I've never done it but my buddy catches minnows in the spring and then salts them.  He puts a couple dozen in a sandwich ziploc bag and salts them heavily and freezes them.  We then us the salties to chum holes when we ice fish.  It really brings them in.  Salts is supposed to be a trigger for fish.  A lot of the plastic baits now come packed in salt.  I don't know if it's all hype but it does seem to bring the fish in.  We have caught fish after chumming a hole that have a belly full of salties!
661091,Cosmos,2012-01-27 16:51:00,588,"I am putting minnows in salt for couple days, after that I am washing them and drying on news paper for 30 minutes. All minnows are going to plastic box and in my fridge. I am not keeping them in freezer, because after freezer it's hard to keep them on the hook."
661097,Billy Bob,2012-01-27 16:56:00,5865," You should just leave them in the salt......put them in a plastic bag or whatever and place in the fridge.... everyone is making too much of salted minnows....DRY them off and place in salt, then place in fridge...nothing more really needs to be done.....except go fishing and catch a fish..."
661118,Leecher,2012-01-27 18:01:00,7832," Your welcome Nick!!! I've been doing this for years now since up here, we can't use live bait... They preserve well in the freezer and when thawed, they're nice and firm... they don't become mush   Your welcome Manitou!!!   Bfisher, you can use smelt if you wish but not the ones that you have in your freezer... get a new batch.  As for what species... I use them for pike, walleye, perch, trout, etc...  They're good for all species of fish      Billy, they actually don't freeze completely and they don't turn to mush when taken out of the freezer.  They are firm.   Hoppy, why not? plastic bait like Yum products are salt based... fish definitely like salt and I don't chum with them, I bait my hooks with them.   Your welcome Homer!!!  Salties works great for any species of fish.  I use them only for hard water fishing to bait my hooks... come spring, I use live leeches or dew worm.   Cosmos, never had any issues putting them into the freezer... they're actually firm and keep very well on the hook."
661123,Oggie,2012-01-27 18:10:00,588,Can you use frozen minnows in Quebec? Dan O.
661125,Leecher,2012-01-27 18:18:00,7832," Yes Dan, only dead or frozen ones in the zone I'm fishing."
661134,Fishing 24/7,2012-01-27 19:09:00,709,THE SECRET IS FINALY OUT THERE!   i was wondering when you would share your SLATIES secret.  but know that i know it.   watch out HERE I COME!  trout AFTER brute AFTER beast after BIGGUN after REDS after WHITIES after BROWNS after CROMERS! HAHAHA  where do i buy the small minnows jaques ?
661136,Leecher,2012-01-27 19:23:00,7832," LOL Kev!!!  You can go to Dépanneur ""Chez Ti-mine"" on Jacques Cartier street along the Ottawa River"
661173,Fishing 24/7,2012-01-27 21:38:00,709," WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!  i dont know that place iv never been there!  jaque do you still have some spare wood tip ups in your basement i might need an extra 5 , if so how much??????"
661185,GBW,2012-01-27 22:17:00,8460,Good tip my friend. when I had minnows in the fish tank and they died (or died out on the ice in the bucket).  I would take them and throw them in a margarine container full of salt.  kept it in the garage and Sinclair and others that have used them can attest that they work.
661200,beginner,2012-01-27 23:13:00,542,"thnks leechman... one more question, the smelt in my freezer, can I used them? or I have to get the fresh one?"
661203,Leecher,2012-01-27 23:40:00,7832," Chez Willie Kev... you've been there many times Just ask for the smallest ones and you're good to go I have a few tops but no base... they're mine but for a good price, I might think about it   Thanks Geoff!!! They sure do   Your welcome bfisher!!!  I'd definitely get a fresh unfrozen batch"
661214,Pigeontroller,2012-01-28 00:15:00,2793,Isn't that much salt bad for their health?
661221,Spouph,2012-01-28 00:29:00,115,"cool but do they catch fish, I mean compared to live bait"
661224,lovetofish,2012-01-28 00:36:00,500,"Try this put a rock in a milk carton, put a scoop full of pinheads in the carton with water and freeze it. Then when u get out there, peel off the carton and put the rest down the hole. As  they defrost, the minnows fall off and it lasts for a while. Never tried it, but i will on sunday.  Lovetofish"
661229,Mike the Pike,2012-01-28 00:40:00,3421,And I thought you were making your own Rod Holders lol 
661308,Leecher,2012-01-28 03:52:00,7832," No, not really... it harden their skins and firms them up good   They most certainly do Spouph... I've caught plenty of fish of different species with them   Never tried this method before but sounds like chumming to me... could be good    If you try, let us know your results   LOL Mike... Rod holders... now there's a possibility"
661656,lovetofish,2012-01-29 13:32:00,500,Made the frozen minnows... But not gonna end up going fishing today :-(
