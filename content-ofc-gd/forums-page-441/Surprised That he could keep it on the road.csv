665052,GBW,2012-02-09 21:53:00,8460,they DO fly!?!?!?!  just not out of a WKRP helicopter though...
665054,DRIFTER_016,2012-02-09 21:55:00,10439,My buddies brother use to drive truck for Consumers Distributing and one night he had a great horned owl crash through the passenger side window and end up on the front seat. But that wasn't the worst part. Before he could get the truck stopped the darned thing came to and started freaking out inside the truck!!!!

665095,Sinker,2012-02-09 23:26:00,8692,"I was behind a woman in a honda civic that had the same thing happen. Lucky for me the turkey was still in pretty good shape, and she didn't want it  S."
665096,Nipfisher,2012-02-09 23:29:00,2449,Would be funny if the driver was drinking a Pepsi.

665197,Dozer,2012-02-10 03:41:00,896,"The placement of those feathers in the first picture is somewhat questionable, but it is wet outside.  Regardless, my dad hit an eagle with his rig, cost a bit of coin to get the body work done."
665198,dave524,2012-02-10 03:42:00,4508,Wild Turkey and Coke is not a good mix
