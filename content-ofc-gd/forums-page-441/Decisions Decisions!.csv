665466,BUSTER,2012-02-11 01:01:00,1336,If i wasn't on the wagon it'd be a cold case of Sleeman Clear
665471,Twocoda,2012-02-11 01:13:00,4130,Moosehead dry used to be great too...but i havent had it since i left the Maritimes 
665480,ctdd2006,2012-02-11 01:45:00,531,OV...premium lager!  Sez so on the label! lol  All I drink!  Cheers.
665484,Joeytier,2012-02-11 01:52:00,3990,OV has gotta be the best cheap macro lager ever.  Love that stuff!
665487,Bob,2012-02-11 02:44:00,370,"In the time and place I grew up, lager was classed as a ladies drink. Real men drank ale. Always enjoyed stopping for a beer at the Clinton Tavern, they had the coldest draft around and usually Molson Export. Long time ago. I can remember the days when if you were in a hotel and asked for a ""Blue"", you got a Molson Stock Ale. That was before Labatts purloined the nickname for their Pilsener. A lot of these brews mentioned here, I've never tasted ( or even seen for that matter ).  Don't drink a lot of beer anymore, makes my glucometer mad at me."
665499,dave524,2012-02-11 03:43:00,4508,"In my younger years Molson's Golden was an ale, somehow it is now a beer, what's up with that"
665503,irishfield,2012-02-11 03:58:00,26272," Well horses only live for so many years... Ale probably died, the new horse must be named Beer!"
665504,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-02-11 04:12:00,0,"LOL @ IRISH!    Lately I've been drinking Mill St. Tankhouse Ale for after fishing or while I'm watching hockey, Bud light for a nice cold and refreshing albeit watery beverage (cheap 30 packs in Sault Ste. Marie,Michigan), and St. ambroise apricot beer as a once in a while treat."
665316,Headhunter,2012-02-10 17:05:00,5703,"I had been making plans to get my two kids out for some Perch on Simcoe this weekend, it would be their first time ice fishin. My 9 year old son has been itching to get out and my 8 year old daughter is pretty keen as well. However, given that we would be white bucketing it, with no shelter, I have been forced to postpone this trip until next weekend given the forecast temps and high winds. I don't want to turn them off on their first trip by freezing their little ba doop do's off on their first try. So, I have decided that we will stay home this weekend and I will do my best to find the bottom of some beer bottles! (2012 has not started off very well!) So my biggest problem is.... yup, lager or ale? What do you guys suggest??? HH"
665317,Live2fish85,2012-02-10 17:08:00,1633,"Some good Mill St. Lager. That will go down nicely in these colder temps. Enjoy, I will be out on Simcoe just sheltered in the warmth of my hut."
665318,asdve23rveavwa,2012-02-10 17:11:00,2690,  I suggest you change your pic to a Max Webster album cover  asking that question.
665321,Nipfisher,2012-02-10 17:16:00,2449,Labatt Blue is a nice PILSNER.
665322,Headhunter,2012-02-10 17:16:00,5703,"Not one to nitpic, but that would be The Kim Mitchell Band.... HH"
665324,asdve23rveavwa,2012-02-10 17:18:00,2690,"  Oops, I went a little too far back  showing my age."
665325,Headhunter,2012-02-10 17:18:00,5703,"Thanks... I find pilsner's to be too sweet... that said, a nice cold box of the ""numbers"" (50) has it's appeal! LOL HH"
665329,backbay,2012-02-10 17:23:00,773," I think I remember it being called Labatt Pilsner back in the 60s. For me, I'll tend towards ales in the winter. (Fullers London Pride, Old Speckled Hen, Mill Street Tankhouse, and lately Crazy Canuck by Great Lakes). Summertime a whole different bunch of lagers or Pilsners, Especially Urquell. . Cheers!"
665331,Spiel,2012-02-10 17:28:00,9065,"Knowing you like I do Joe I'd say Steam Whistle, nasty beer in IMO but good enough for you.  Or perhaps some lemon wedges......"
665332,BillM,2012-02-10 17:28:00,17367,Hockley Black and Tan for me!
665336,Headhunter,2012-02-10 17:31:00,5703,From the guy who drinks Carling!!!!!!! Lemons are an important source of vitamins and fibre.... HH
665338,Moosebunk,2012-02-10 17:36:00,3970,"Like that Mill St. choice.  Maybe if the unseasonably warm temps keep up you should take Corona, some limes, sandals and your banana hammock! lol."
665340,Nipfisher,2012-02-10 17:39:00,2449,  No pictures PLEASE.
665343,danbouck,2012-02-10 17:43:00,4380,kronenbourg 1664 for lager  Mill Steet Tankhouse for ale
665347,Rod Caster,2012-02-10 17:59:00,5784,Lake of Bays Pale Ale  Muskoka Premium Lager  ...you'll find like your at the cottage with both
665350,Rod Caster,2012-02-10 18:03:00,5784,"  Ugh, no offense, but that tankhouse ale was enough to put me in the outhouse. It's almost as bad as Red Racer Pale Ale..."
665351,cuzza,2012-02-10 18:03:00,467,Winter is a good time for Fullers ESB  
665354,Twocoda,2012-02-10 18:07:00,4130,get both and tell us which ones you liked better....>>>>>I SOLVE PROBLEMS<<<<<<<  Cheers!!!
665358,asdve23rveavwa,2012-02-10 18:18:00,2690,Winter = stout  Guinness all the way.
665359,kuhaman,2012-02-10 18:21:00,503,"Lakeport honey for me, cheap and tolerable LOL"
665363,John,2012-02-10 18:23:00,2956, Yikes....
665364,John,2012-02-10 18:24:00,2956, Now there's some good stuff right there........just sayin'
665396,Twocoda,2012-02-10 20:32:00,4130,Sinclair this stement is wrong on sooooooooooo many levels....but i have to give it up to Steam Whistle for the innovation to duplicate the pine car fresheners into an alcoholic beverage....
665399,fishnsled,2012-02-10 20:40:00,3520,    He's just showing his age John....   Edit - Should add this - If you can find it around it's worth a try. Barley Days Brewery Some LCBO's carry the product or if you are out the Picton way just stop in. Hours and map.
665460,Joeytier,2012-02-11 00:33:00,3990,"February is stout season!  Just finished up a bottle of Lake of Bays Mocha Porter.  Also keep an eye out for Great Lake's Brewery's Red Leaf Ale [red ale similar to Rickards but far better], Black Creek Porter, as well as Creemore's UrBock.  All excellent craft-brewed Ontario beer."
