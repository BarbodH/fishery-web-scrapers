665090,spinnerbaitking,2012-02-09 23:08:00,1622,Has it been decide were the money will go Fisheries or Charity just asking SBK
665155,shoemaker,2012-02-10 01:56:00,12," For this project, there seems to be several support for the Tyler Event and I have already contacted Elisa....so its for young Tyler.  I hope down the road we can do another project for a hatchery program...maybe a hat or jacket or something else. My preference would be not to use the OFC and just use something generic like Angling Community or something.....just a thought."
665166,Roy,2012-02-10 02:32:00,13728,"Yes, all shirts sold will be for the Fishing for Tyler event. All monies will go to Tyler. Shirts or any other items not sanctioned by OFC will not be sold through our community. Remember your mantra ""Giving back to the community""."
665174,shoemaker,2012-02-10 02:50:00,12,"Hi Everyone,  Just a quick update. I contacted Elisa and she is working out the details on the payment. Hopefully i can have an answer tomorrow. Meanwhile, the price of the shirts will be $10. I tallied up everyone's order but missing many shirt sizes. Please have a look and fill in the blank. Maybe someone can police these members just to see if they are still interested.  I have not receive any art yet...but simple is the theme. Elisa did mention she may have a sponsor for the shirt....i think it would be nice...more money the better.  In terms of disbursement, Rod Caster - maybe you can get in touch with Elisa also, develop some type of centralized system....there has been a few that has offered to help to look after certain areas. This would save the shipping charges. Or if the member wants the item shipped...just add the postage to the price of the shirt. Or even better, pick them up at the event. But someone needs to be in charge of the name list whom has paid and what they are getting.  Any thoughts?"
665184,bigugli,2012-02-10 03:06:00,6138,Picking up the shirt at the event sounds good.
665190,Nipfisher,2012-02-10 03:26:00,2449,Large Grey or Black for me.  If local members want to go through me I am cool with that. I will collect from this area and place 1 order for shirts.
665229,Big Cliff,2012-02-10 12:35:00,6899,"OK, anyone in the Kawarthas, Pickering, Oshawa, Ajax, Uxbridge (or points in between or in those general areas) that want me to pick up their shirts and deliver them for free. PM me with the number of shirts etc. and your address. I will pre pay them, pick them up at the Tyler event, and deliver them to you and collect the money the following week."
665232,shoemaker,2012-02-10 12:40:00,12,"  My bad, stupid me thinking community first."
665234,shoemaker,2012-02-10 12:53:00,12,"  Hey Big Cliff, I can drop them off in your local. Please pm me your contact. Anyone else that wants to rep the other areas, I can drop them off to you also.  I am still missing many sizes....please see attachment. So far black is the colour of choice. Tyler Ts Size Colour summary.pdf"
665247,radar,2012-02-10 13:45:00,138,"If it helps to keep things straight, I've pm'd Big Cliff and will put my order through him. Don't know if you need to take me off the main list. 2 shirts - 1 small, 1 medium (don't care what colour but if you need me to choose - grey)  And thanks for doing this"
665251,NAW,2012-02-10 13:59:00,4022,"I see I'm on the list, but no size.  Mark me down for a Large please.  If there are going to be two be two colours, then please up me to 2 large shirts, one black, and one a different colour.  But only if there are two different colours to choose from."
662298,Big Cliff,2012-01-31 21:22:00,6899,"Well, I'm all for the idea and I would be willing to take care of the distribution/collection for the Kawarthas area.  As far as where the money should go; This will be our 8th year supporting the Fishing For Tyler event. The money we would raise from the T-shirt venture isn't likely going to make much of a dent in any of the hatchery programs but could make a significant contribution to one little boy who really does need our continued help and support.  For those that don't know, Tyler doesn't get much help from our goverment programs if any at all. Every year the bit of money we manage to raise to help the French family get Tyler the treatments he needs gets put to very good use. For those that have been involved over the years and seen the wonderful progress Tyler has made the reward is ever present and carried well within our hearts.  Kudos to you for stepping up to the plate and trying to do something to make a difference! I'd really like to meet you some day and buy you a cold (or hot) one whatever your choice might be."
662387,radar,2012-02-01 02:17:00,138,I have not been able to contribute to Fishing for Tyler so would love to see it. Strong OFC logo presence would be nice. I'm in for a shirt or 2. Anything with OFC and charity I'm good for.
664636,Big Cliff,2012-02-08 15:12:00,6899,Just wondered where this whole project is at? Anything being done or has it just been dropped!
664647,Roy,2012-02-08 15:47:00,13728,Yes Cliff it's certainly a worthwhile project. I have asked Shoemaker to contact Elisa French to make arrangements for the Tyler event.
664661,shoemaker,2012-02-08 16:50:00,12,"  I contacted Roy yesterday and this morning i received the admins blessing so we can proceed with this project.  First, we need to determine which charity the money should go to? I am fine with a hatchery or Tyler's event. Someone previously posted that the money going to a hatchery will not really make a significant difference and would provide a better impact if it was going to Tyler's event. I agree with this and my vote is for Tyler's event.....hope everyone is OK with this.  Second, can someone do the administration of collecting the money and logistics of disbursing the shirts....i am terrible at this. I think this person should be an admin or someone whom has belong on this board for a long time and well known in the forum. There are a few that has volunteered, any comments or thoughts or suggestions as whom should take on this part?  Third, timing....if we agreed its going to the Tyler's Event....we need to move fast in getting the money and shirt sizes. I need to order, print, and disburse these items and require a few days to complete this.  Fourth, art....what would you like to see printed on the shirts? If i can get some suggestions i can do up some layouts/options and narrow down the choices. I presume we want to keep this simple on a basic white short sleeved shirts. I suggest we use Hanes or Gildan 100% cotton, both are decent quality and good value. I will disclose my net cost and recoup this cost only, I will provide my invoice to the person in charge of money. OFC can have the charity receipt for tax purposes....i don't really know how this works.  I too would like to get this going and with some help and support, lets do what we can.  Any feedback, comments or suggestions are welcomed but timing is of essence."
664693,Roy,2012-02-08 18:49:00,13728,"Shoemaker, get in touch with Elisa French at the email address that I gave you and if she agrees to this, she will get you the logo for the shirts. Elisa will probably be in a better position to tell you how many shirts you need etc."
664742,Big Cliff,2012-02-08 22:13:00,6899,"If the money is going to Tyler, you can count me in for 3 shirts minimum. Graphics; I would suggest.  Ontairo Fishing Community Fishing For Tyler 2012  But you can count me in for whatever for a minimum of three.  Now, if anyone in the Kawarthas wants to get involved I would suggest Earnie at The Shop would be an ideal place to drop of funds and collect shirts. He is a long time OFCr, in a good location, and a true die hard fisherman. Sorry Earnie I did this without your permission! Apart from that, I would be most willing to step up and do it."
664747,mattybculp,2012-02-08 22:37:00,388,where is Ernie located ?
664756,MrChamp,2012-02-08 23:24:00,6,i would love to see us support Ireshfield and his daughter by supporting a hospital or cancer society of his choice. Just a thought i will also help others.
664758,camillj,2012-02-08 23:36:00,1988,Not to Hijack the T-shirt thread ... but I just wanted to declare ...I would pay AT LEAST DOUBLE face value for good leafs tickets should any kind donor put them up for auction as a TYLER fund raiser offering ... auction or whatever
664763,NAW,2012-02-08 23:50:00,4022,"I'm in for a 1 shirt as long as they're not WHITE!  Make them black, or brown, and dark blue, green, whatever, just not white.  I never wear white shirts fishing  Maybe a logo like..  OFC.. The facebook of fishing!"
664784,Skipper D,2012-02-09 01:01:00,1970,"Real glad this is going to happen "" the T-shirt thing"" to which ever cause . Some one let us know who do we contact to place our orders , give our shirt size and give the money too ."
664803,Live2fish85,2012-02-09 02:15:00,1633,"I agree with Cliff after hearing it stated that way. The money raised most likely wouldn't really effect the fisheries that much. That being said I know how much of a pain in the A$$ our government is with helping the people that really need it whether it be helping with meds or housing whatever. I think it would be great to see the money help the family out and Tyler, specially as we have been helping for awhile as it seems. I will be in for a couple shirts as well. Another thing I agree with is the colour thing. We should do a few colours because I as well I am not fond of white shirts as I tebd to always get a stain on them."
664830,shoemaker,2012-02-09 04:03:00,12,"I contacted Elisa about the t-shirts and she is very excited and will help organize the process. We will work out a few details and I will let everyone know how it will play out next day or two. She has a friend that does photography and will provide the artwork to us. Its good to see everyone's support...you don't know me and I don't know you.....makes it even more exciting for me.  Talk is cheap so pony up everyone. I just did a quick tally and below are those who has committed, if i made an error or missed someone....pls let me know. The numbers next to your handle is what you requested. Next minor detail is sizing, please let me know your sizing. The shirts are pre-shrunk 100% cotton, no need to up-size...sizes from sm - 5xl. As for colour, you have about 60 colours to choose from....i suggest we go with 1 colour so make your selection and majority wins, lets keep it simple. I need everyone's input and money (to be determined where to be sent) by Monday February 20. This only gives me a few days to place the order, screen it, and get it to a destined local by 23 or 24 very latest.  If you have any questions or comments please let me know.

665061,Rod Caster,2012-02-09 22:13:00,5784,"How about this: one person to collect the orders (sizes, how many, shipping address, email address/phone number). That ""broker"" would also receive the funds through their paypal account (or cheque) and that ""broker"" would then forward the printing fees to Shoemaker. The $6 charity money would also be forwarded to Fishing for Tyler by the ""broker"".  Shoemaker would ship all the shirts in one lot to the ""broker"".  Anyone placing an order would let the broker know where they want the shirts shipped; the buyer would have to pay extra for shipping. Buyers can also purchases for multiple people. For example, Nipfisher could place an order for 10 people in North Bay. Those people would then pick up the shirts at their leisure/availability by making plans with Nipfisher.  I figure a single shirt would cost $4 regular post to ship. So if the shirts cost $14: $4 goes to printing, $4 goes to shipping and $6 goes to charity. If the ""broker"" makes a bit of extra cash, because there are a lot of multiple orders they can just add that to the charity purse.  What do you guys/girls think?   "
665069,bigugli,2012-02-09 22:30:00,6138,Cheapest Canpost parcel rate is $8.40
665072,Rod Caster,2012-02-09 22:36:00,5784,"  Thanks for checking, Bruce. It may be possible to get a single shirt as a ""small package"". But that also costs over $5. So yes, shipping costs would be higher than $4. Idealy, our ""broker"" would live near Shoemaker which would further reduce shipping costs and simplfiy the logistics."
661979,shoemaker,2012-01-30 17:35:00,12,"Hi OFC Gang,  I have read many posts and visited this superb site often but never really participated in any discussions.  Hows this for diving in....just wondering if there would be any interest in printing up some t-shirts and sold to those that would be obliged to buy them on this forum and 100% of the proceeds after net costs will go to some type of charity. I would print them for free, someone can come up with the design/artwork, and another can do the administration of collecting the monies. I have some down time and wanted to give something back to the community. There was a post on the homeless and I did some work for The Good Shepperd and this kinda put the thought in my head, of course it can be any charity.  I know there are alot of ppl out there hurting and just wanted to see if there were any interest in pooling some ideas and do what we can. What i had in mind is if the net cost of the t-shirt is $3, we can silk screen a OFC (with proper permission) or other designs and sell it for $10, the $7 can go to 1 or more charity of choice.  This is just a thought, any comments or feedback welcomed.  Shoemaker"
661986,NAW,2012-01-30 17:53:00,4022,"I think it's a good idea, and would be interested in buying a t-shirt.  Welcome to the board eh!"
661987,spinnerbaitking,2012-01-30 17:55:00,1622,"Great idea I personally would like the proceeds to go back into the Fisheries maybe some School Hatcheries or one of the many Fish Hatcheries that are in the Province, last year our Team #7 The Rod Benders bought shirt when we won the OFC Tournament with team logo on the front & 2010 Champs-OFC Team#7 The Rod Benders More Inches Per Rod on the back, lots of comments this past year & I'm still wearing my 2 Thanx & Tight Lines SBK   Oh Ya Welcome to the Board"
661989,Jds63,2012-01-30 17:57:00,1365,sounds like a nice idea .... I would buy one .. if its works with the admins
662017,Nipfisher,2012-01-30 19:26:00,2449,Welcome to the board Shoemaker. I would be interested in buying one. If we get the permission my suggestion is we keep the shirt design really simple.

662091,Rod Caster,2012-01-30 22:56:00,5784,"Top notch idea. I'd purchase one for sure.  We don't use the Ontario Sport Fishing Logo on this site and swag from that site seems to have all but disappeared and the Logo at the top left of this page is a bit...well...underwhelming, so I don't know what we would use as a logo. If we came up with some art, I agree with Nipfisher that it should be kept simple. Maybe ask Bushart to come up with something using ""Ontario Fishing Community""???  I'd help with Admin, but I think it would be easier for someone in Barrie or Toronto, or somebody nearby you, Shoemaker."
662096,Locnar,2012-01-30 23:18:00,645,"Hell yeah I'll take a shirt! I like nipfisher's idea of keeping it simple, maybe just a fish (which ever species you so chose) with OFC printed below/above/beside it. I also do like the idea of putting some of the money back into the fisheries, gotta put some back to replace the ones taken."
662110,ccmtcanada,2012-01-31 00:10:00,7971,Count me in for a shirt
662113,bigugli,2012-01-31 00:21:00,6138,I'd be in for a shirt. Funds to Tyler sounds like a great idea. Caricature of an unspecified admin in a pink tutu come to mind
662122,Handlebarz,2012-01-31 00:40:00,3790,One suggestion before you make all the shirts have people pay for there orders to which ever long standing member is holding the cash that way they are paid for and your not sitting there with 200 shirts and no one buying them. This will also give you a correct number to make and not be left with to many extras this has happened in the past to many times.  Great idea for sure I also like the idea of helping out some hatchery or school project that is in direct relation for our fishing future.
662128,Rod Caster,2012-01-31 01:24:00,5784,"Maybe gather a few popular Charity selections and then put them in a poll? So far we have....  Fishing for Tyler. A specified hatchery program. The Good Sheppard. etc..  Same can be done with two or three T-shirt design ideas.  Once these are decided, we could pick a ""Fund Collector"" and begin taking orders. Like Mike just said, collect the orders and money for a couple weeks or a month, then print the shirts..maybe make an extra 10 for stragglers.  I'd probably buy two or three...they'd make for great prizes at next year's Nip G2G."
662138,Live2fish85,2012-01-31 02:19:00,1633,I would take a couple for sure. There are lots of charities but I also agree with the hatchery program. There are plenty of charities for good sheppard and thing along those lines and things like heart and stroke but not many for the fish hatcheries and we are all on here because we love fishing.
662144,shoemaker,2012-01-31 02:36:00,12,"Some good ideas on keeping it basic and simple. Good points on the prepaid orders, otherwise i would have to peddle these from boat to boat.  I have attached an image just for viewing, still awaiting word from admin if we can do this or not. We can use this or a bass or any logo...its wide open. In terms of collecting money i fully support someone that has been a member here for a long time to take over this part. One thing to note is the shipping/delivery of the shirts...to save money maybe hookup at Tims or at a few central local to disperse the shirts.  As charity goes, I suggest we select only one unless there is a sizeable amount that can be divided up. OFC can have the donation receipt...not sure how the tax thing works.  Good to see the support.
