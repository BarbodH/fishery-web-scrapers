665877,ketchenany,2012-02-12 21:06:00,3229,  Is it the one with the TTC streetcar? Great place to stop on the way th Sauble Beah with the kids!
665880,Fisherman,2012-02-12 21:15:00,7201," Well I'm betting that it's definitely NOT the DQ. I know Teds Range Rd Diner, but that's off 26."

662767,bigugli,2012-02-02 05:00:00,6138,"There used to be a number of great Mom & Pop places along the old 69, but are all gone.  Still French River Trading Post is decent. The Haven in Pointe Au Baril used to be good. Webers is just a tourist trap serving undersized burgers at an inflated price. They were good once, but that was decades back. Almost forgot, big brekkies at the Husky just off the 400, and the restaurant at Tudhope Pk not to bad for brekkie either."
662768,crappieperchhunter,2012-02-02 05:09:00,2582, X2 for that. My folks used to have a place in Tobermory and that burger stop was always part of the plans on the way through. I have not been over that way for 6-7 years now so I don't know if it is still there. But it was one of the best burger joints I have ever been in.
662784,wormdunker,2012-02-02 10:34:00,1711,"If travelling east from Sudbury to North Bay on Hwy 17 there's a place called Kate's Restaurant, is an excellent breakfast. Just a small place, owned by Mennonites, so most of the food is home made.  Very friendly staff.  I was there last Saturday on my way to the annual M&G on Callandar.  Best toasted western I've ever had.  I'ts approx 4 km east of Hagar.  Randy U must know this place."
662789,Musky or Specks,2012-02-02 11:28:00,2710,Danny's gets another vote from me. Been stopping there for nigh on 15 years now. Food is awesome and the waitresses aren't hard to look at.
662810,Jer,2012-02-02 12:53:00,1426,"If you're ever fishing the Tri-Lakes, Jesse'e Tap & Grill in Ennismore is always worth a visit. I second the Peppermill in Carnarvon, for simpler fare in the area the Millpond is a good bet."
662827,Dave Bailey,2012-02-02 13:28:00,1641,"Okay, going through a few more Restaurantica posts. I'll just report on the ones near or on the way to fishing spots.  The Ponderosa, 12 Front St. in McTier, had a lovely breakfast there a couple of years ago.  Just Eddies, 598 Atherley Road, Orillia, right near the narrows.  Falls View, 9 Lindsay St., Fenelon Falls. Not fine dining, just family place, but excellent variety of dishes. And you can't beat sitting right beside the falls!  The Mill Cafe 12 Bridge St., Thornbury. Had a venison stew there that was divine! They have an outside deck beside the water.  The Riverhouse, right beside the Severn Falls Marina on Big Chute Rd."

And as for Dan's entry for the best Chicken Parmagana... I'll have to go try it and see if it's better than the Village Idiot at Dundas/McCaul in TO (across from the Art Museum). Or maybe it's just the pints of Fuller's London Pride that gets me in there..

If you're coming down the 401 by toronto and want a great sub, nothing really beats Belly Busters just south a few blocks on Yonge St.  The chip truck on #28 south of Stoney is pretty good too."

662606,kickingfrog,2012-02-01 22:01:00,8333,"I first thought about this while driving 1100kms to my fly-in fishing trip this past September, and another post reminded me again.  What are your favourite places to eat at while on the road? It's getting harder and harder now with the 400 series hwy and the proliferation of chains to find a good spot to get good eats.  To be honest, I don't have much to offer because the two places we used to stop at between T.O. and North Bay (the part of the province I've traveled the most) are no more.  The only one I can think of is Stolley's (sp?) in Kingston. It's not on the hwy and is actually down by Queens university. Good burgers and great fries. One problem is that the clientele is predominately students and if you're older than about 25 a large group of them can be a bit much at times. An early Lunch on Saturdays or Sundays can be funny 'cause the all the kids will hung over hard."
662607,irishfield,2012-02-01 22:07:00,26272,Antonio's in South River - good lasagna and sandwiches.  Chinese in Temagami - Helen and Terry's place - don't even have to tell her what I want.  Rob Roy's Pub & Restaurant in Smiths Falls - main drag.. right where the bridge starts on west side of street last building heading south  ..or Gerbo's right across the street for nice Greasy pizza.. a delicacy for me since the '60's !

662619,Rod Caster,2012-02-01 23:09:00,5784,"Dan, the restaurant at the french river trading post is pretty good. In gravenhurst, there is a new restaurant that offers the FRESHEST food around! They are only open certain times of the day so they can get their ingredients. For the life of me I can't remember its name, its on the main stretch, left hand side as you enter northbound from hwy11. The GBay whitefish was fantastic!  Dannys Justa Pasta near South River, on Hwy 11 is good too.  Man, I travel so much that I have tons of good spots, unfortunately my memory for restaurant names is terrible.  Oh, if your ever on St. Josephs Island, go to The Lighthouse!"
662620,Acountdeleted,2012-02-01 23:10:00,2562,Mkiio's in Hearst Ontario. Best burger I've ever had in my life by far.  #2 on my top burger spot is Gilligans in southwest Ontario (its a chain).  Apache burger is right near my place but I've never been.... maybe I'll take the girlfriend this weekend.
662628,Rod Caster,2012-02-01 23:29:00,5784, You like burgers?
662633,DRIFTER_016,2012-02-01 23:35:00,10439, There's a really good restaurant in Meaford that makes a killer home made burger too. I can't remember the name though. Little place on the left side of the road when heading through town on your way towards Owen Sound. It's right in the heart of town seveal blocks West of the river.

Not the nicest looking place, but they serve the BEST suicide hot wings ever!!   If you like the hottest chicken wings, try these if you're in the area.  HOTTT WINGS!!  You have to order the hottest they have!   I also like the hottest wings from Moose Delaney's in Huntsville. So, we often eat there when we stay over in Huntsville chasing Splake in the Spring and Fall.   One place that I finally tried a while back was Weber's on Highway 11.  It really wasn't very good and I don't know what all the hype is about.  You want a good burger?  Try Golden Star on Yonge Street in Thornhill (just north of Steeles).  You have to order the homemade burger (the other one isn't very good).  AWESOME burger!   Beats Apache hands down IMO (Although, I like the Apache bun). "

Indoor and outdoor hot tubs (all year long) good rooms, pool.  Great McGuffin photography all over the place. Not a bad spot to get cleaned up and relax. Kinnawabi Pines - good food but be prepared to wait and wait. There's a German place on Pancake bay that is great and another in Bruce Mines.  The Voyager near the Batchawana is ok for burgs. Nothing like the Wildcat or Bullocks in Yellowknife, although the Wilno Tavern on a Tuesday night is alright. Seems like the small diners with character are disappearing."
