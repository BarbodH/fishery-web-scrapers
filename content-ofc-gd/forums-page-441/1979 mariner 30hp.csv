665467,tomO,2012-02-11 01:02:00,363,"I got a chance to buy it for one hundred dollars been in storage a couple of years but he said it ran when it was put away. I pretty sure its yamaha built but being so old I'm not sure if it's worth messing with, any one have or had one? 689-301932 is the model number. just curious."
665469,bigbuck,2012-02-11 01:12:00,2449,"For a hundred bucks, even if it doesn't run you should be able to get it going for a couple of hundred. Those old two strokes were smoky and hard to start but they ran forever."
665472,mike rousseau,2012-02-11 01:14:00,4661,if your handy with small engines id say go for it...  make sure it runs...  i sold a late 80s  9.9 johnson for $900 a couple years back... so if it runs... 100 bucks is a good price...those old motors are great if they are in working order when you buy them...
665501,Sinker,2012-02-11 03:49:00,8692,"If it ran when it was put away, it should run now. Try and fire it up. I bet it runs fine.  S."
665517,Dabluz,2012-02-11 06:40:00,701,"Wow....great deal.  I'm sure that the old motor will work fine with just a bit of work.  Compression test, new plugs, new oil, carburetor cleaning, gas filter and a good visual inspection.  I have a few old motors and they are easy to work on and have no complicated parts.  Even if you don't need it or want it, you can make a good profit with it.  If it's beyond repair, you can make a profit just from selling parts on Ebay."
665528,hawk-eye,2012-02-11 08:22:00,141,Be careful....parts can be hard to find.
665530,Dave216,2012-02-11 08:55:00,3,"First post but not the last. I have been watching waytoo long. Take lots of pictures if you take on the project. It will help you,us watching and others trying to help you on this site. I picked up a 1957evinrude 5.5 running but in need of help, lots of help. I picked up all sealsbearings bushings carb kit and all the advice from Klaus Marine (great guy atthe counter for older stuff). Took apart and REALY put the 5.5 back together. Irun it on a 12 ft. and have never had a problem besides it should run on 16:1. "
665640,tomO,2012-02-11 21:40:00,363,Ok thx all I'll try and and get it started. Dave 216 are you saying that the mariner runs on 16 - 1 mix?
665671,captpierre,2012-02-12 00:29:00,2521,I thought Mariners were just Mercs in a grey cowling?
665693,tomO,2012-02-12 01:53:00,363,the older ones were first made by yamaha.
665694,tomO,2012-02-12 01:56:00,363,"Oh and the first snag I've run into is I can't get it shifted into reverse, and the starting rope pulls hard and doesn't come out very far."
665695,Big Cliff,2012-02-12 01:58:00,6899,"If it has compression it is probably worth fixing! Apart from that spark and fuel is all it needs, both easy fixes if need be."
665697,Big Cliff,2012-02-12 02:00:00,6899, Could be a lot more wrong with it then.
665844,Sinker,2012-02-12 17:00:00,8692,"Is this a tiller model?  It won't shift into reverse if the throttle is turned past shift. BAck the throttle off on the tiller handle, and try shifting.  It also won't pull over in gear. Might be stuck in forward.  Have you drained the lower unit? What did/does the oil look like? Maybe it won't shift because it has water in it, and its frozen?  IMO, it is worth fixing. I have a 40HP just like it, and its bullet proof. I can't seem to kill it.  I""m assuming this is a 2 cylinder, 2 stroke? You sure its a 79? Long shaft, or short shaft?  I have a buddy with one that is a long shaft, tiller. I""m not sure of the year of his, but its older than mine. They are all pretty much the same. Engine is yamaha, drive is merc. Most parts for mine come from a yamaha dealer. The merc guys can never figure it out!! Great motors!! His 30hp almost keeps up to my 40...on a bit narrower hull.   S."
665847,tomO,2012-02-12 17:18:00,363,"Yea its a tiller but the arm isn't on it but I have it I haven't paid him anything yet .I told him if I got it started I would and he's ok with that,  its on the basement floor so I really haven't started on it just messed with it a little. It's a 2 cycle long shaft. It shifts into forward and neutral ok and I was on line checking the serial number and I think it's a 79."
665851,Sinker,2012-02-12 17:40:00,8692,"MIne will shift into forward or neutral at any rpm, but for reverse, I have to have the throttle down to the shift(slow) postition on the tiller handle for it to go.  It sounds like there is a catch there that is stopping it from going into reverse.  I'm curious what the lower unit oil looks like.  Maybe put a few drops of oil down each cylinder and give it a few pulls. Might loosen it up enough to get it running.  S."
665855,tomO,2012-02-12 17:58:00,363,"Ok Might be a few days before I can get into it, thx to all."
665863,captpierre,2012-02-12 18:55:00,2521,My Dad has a Mariner 40hp 2 stroke from the 90's.  Is it at Yammy powerhead too?
665871,Sinker,2012-02-12 20:17:00,8692,"Yep, it will be mostly yamaha. Mine is a '93, 2 cylinder, 2 stroke.  Its a 50:1 mix, and use good oil.  S."
