I'm launching from Lasalle Park in Burlington and going out into the lake from there.  Are there any good areas in this area of the lake?  Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks"

Dipsy Diver Flasher Down rigger Stacker  Those are just some words off the top of my head, but if you don't know what they are, you have some reading to do.  Try http://www.spoonpullers.com  As for your launch location, they're out there, but that part of the lake doesn't generally heat up for a while."
