187094,Handlebarz,2008-04-14 18:29:00,3790,Ron you have a good name and you know there are alot of people that will come out when needed I am glad to here that it went well here.
195206,Ron,2008-05-01 23:09:00,1683,"Once again I would like to thank all of you for your generous donations. Through the web site and mail ins, Our family has raised over $3000.00!  Thank you very much!  The Waumer walk went with out a hitch! The weather man was definitely on our side. You couldn't have asked for a better day. It goes without saying this brings people out in the masses. Not having an accurate tally on participants, I can assure you there were well over 2000 participants on the walk. Julie Wamsley did a spectacular job on organizing, that's for sure! My hat is off to you Julie.  Awareness is what this is all about, I think the only function down here larger is our Water Front Festival, which draws a crowd from all around.  Julie and Dennis' determination, dedication and personality speaks for itself.  Here is a link to some of the photos taken by Pete Fisher, one of our News Paper photographers. (Thanks Pete)... Northumberland Emergency Services  Cheers, Ron..."

185879,Ron,2008-04-12 03:55:00,1683,Wow!  The donations have been over whelming! I really want to thank all of you for brightening my nieces last few days!  They are just amazed on what a couple of forums can do!  My one niece Kari asked me to forward this:  I would like to thank everyone for their support in fighting ALS. With your support and help we will find a cure. It means the world to me to fight this disease that is not only taking away my Dad but also my best friend and hero. Words will never tell you how grateful I am. Thank you again and your generosity will never be forgotten.  Kari Spry    Most of the important things in the world have been accomplished by people who have kept on trying when there seemed to be no hope at all. â€“ Dale Carnegie   I personally would like to thank you all too!
