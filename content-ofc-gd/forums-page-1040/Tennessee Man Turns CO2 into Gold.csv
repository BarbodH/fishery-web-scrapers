195072,jonnybass,2008-05-01 19:27:00,346,What's this?
195074,TennesseeGuy,2008-05-01 19:29:00,957,"Good move Roy.  Your plan sure beats whining about prices.  September 29, 2005 while driving through Minnesota heading for Red Lake I bought a little over the minimum purchase of Vanguard Energy Funds and it's returned enough for my family to buy fuel (at today's price) for seven years of driving.  No law states I can't invest more.   ................................or I could buy Ford, General Motors or Chrysler.  Duh...."

195146,TennesseeGuy,2008-05-01 21:30:00,957,"Good for him.  Somebody wants to buy them, go for it.  I'll bet a beer he hasn't sold any to you.  He might make a good son-in-law."
195153,OhioFisherman,2008-05-01 21:42:00,6623,"LOL Connie, the beers waiting. I am still living in the 1960`s, I burned 20 bucks worth of gas last month. Heck a good son in law is one that keeps a roof over my daughters head."
