Other than that getting out in our boat on Kawartha Lakes as often as possible....and of course our usual shore fishing jaunts during the week after dinner.
194727,Billy Bob,2008-05-01 00:37:00,5865," Houseboat, great time. Did that 2 times in the Kawartha lakes. Even caught a couple muskies by accident but no size to speak of. I fish mostly walleye and walleye and when I get bored with walleye I just go walleye fishing"

194734,jahmad,2008-05-01 00:42:00,5,"My most memorable trip was to the mouth of Harmony Creek after ice out, I seen L2P / 'Sweet 15' down there with a 15ft cane rod resting on a ledger, and he had his old black loomis duck taped to the butt of the rod. I asked him what he was fishing for and he told me it was an Ancient secret. I learnt a lot from him that day about old world fishing. It shows you do not have to travel far to learned about other cultures."
