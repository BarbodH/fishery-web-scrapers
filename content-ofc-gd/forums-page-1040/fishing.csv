Im only 17 so my dad wont let me drive all over the place, but these were GB tribs and im sure that the lake o tribs are twice as bad.  i was just wondering if anyone could point me in the right direction as to where to fish, through a PM of course, or would consider meeting up one day to show me the ropes (and possibly my dad too, lol).  it seems like no matter how many spots we drive to, we never catch fish, even if people around us are hooking into them.  thanks in advance, hopefully someone is willing to point me in the right direction.  Mike"

Weekends are usually busy at all the well known spots this time of year.  I'm sure someone will PM you with a good spot to try. The spots I know will be the same that you experienced. Sorry.  Also, if people around you are catching fish you know that they're there, so maybe you should look to see what baits they're using and change it up.  Good luck!"
