195455,Sinker,2008-05-02 14:16:00,8692,"Are you positive it was a goby, and not a sculpin?  Sinker"
195458,Mark Kulik,2008-05-02 14:21:00,348,"The sculpin almost identical and there are lots in Simcoe, but unfortunaley test netting have confirmed their presence, so it very well could have been a goby-he did the right thing to yurn it in, the goby have a 1-piece-fused pectoral fin where the sculpin are 2 separate ones."
195505,Whopper,2008-05-02 16:17:00,2174,You think the smallmouth on Simcoe are big now just wait until they make the gobies a staple of their diet
