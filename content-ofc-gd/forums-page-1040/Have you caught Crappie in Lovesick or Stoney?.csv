With the high cost of gas I'd like to fish closer to home. I don't want your spots, I just want to know that I'm not wasting my time. Thanks for helping. Garry2rs"
194966,Hookset,2008-05-01 15:14:00,367,"Yes to Crappies on Stoney. Had a blast at my friends cottage fishing all night off his dock. Outta the lake right into batter and oil. Damn they are delicious. Same as most lakes in Ontario, the Crappie population continues to grow. Definitely not wasting your time.   Hookset."

195012,radar,2008-05-01 16:46:00,138,My brother caught a huge slab up by the dam in most northern part on Lovesick(Ducks bay??? or something like that) . Right in front of the campsite at the dam. Been a while since I was there. The owner's at Ardagh said he's heard of them being caught but didn't really know of anyone coming up to target them.
195018,Billy Bob,2008-05-01 16:55:00,5865,"YES to Stoney, last mid June fishing for walleye with black bucktail jigs and very large ones at that"
195042,nelly,2008-05-01 17:44:00,256,"Have caught afew crappie on Stoney but not the mother load and they were half decent size. I have had better catch on Pigeon and Buckhorn and some 100+ day. Timing is everything and long as you find one. keep working around the area. They can also be very tight in some spots. I will try to keep my eyes open for Bean.  Stoty, where is your cottage on Stoney? Will not be able to get out until walleye season."
195047,Stoty,2008-05-01 17:54:00,2910,I am actually on Clear Lake. Also some BIG crappie in there!
