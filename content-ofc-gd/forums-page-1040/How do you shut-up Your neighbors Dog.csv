195167,OhioFisherman,2008-05-01 22:00:00,6623,"Dogs are kind of like kids, you want good behavior out of them you have to put a bit of time in with them, a lot of people want dogs but don`t want to put in the time...  I was a truck driver, a lot of different stops, and dogs, a bag of bones can do wonders, carry a few in the pocket and talk nice to the dog throw him a bone, most don`t bite the hand that feeds them.  3 dogs at home, they get nervous when someone or something is heading for their space. The bark at the horses next door, the horses ignore them and they get over it, they bark at the neighbors dogs that enter the yard, then want to go out and play with them.  They bark at the neighbors, then go over and make friends."

195172,irishfield,2008-05-01 22:08:00,26272,I'd say Cory was commending Garry2R's for getting it right...  and...  Dang Gerritt.. guess I'm a smuck. Our Lab spent 13 years outside... free roam of 120 acres and to the best of our knowledge never crossed the fence line.. always there to meet us at the back door when we drove in the laneway..... happy to curl up in a snow bank at -30C.. and you couldn't drag him in the house to change that. And he didn't bark at anyone or thing.. other than the odd night when a Coyote strolled to close to the house and he made sure they knew who was boss. Most dogs where bred to be outside dogs before people started using them like surrogate children. Think back 25 years if you can and compare how many people had a dog in the yard vs the house back then.
195175,Clampet,2008-05-01 22:14:00,1947,"I think the big problem is too many people living too closely with no space. Irish has a lot of space so he can have a dog roam about, but city folk are all crammed together.  It makes fer a lot of stress."
195177,Gerritt,2008-05-01 22:16:00,6129,"Wayne, You are correct.. Some dogs are meant or want to be outside. Sorry I misspoke and posted my comments in a rush... having a 2 year old pulling on you shirt constantly can do that to you..  But there is a difference between a lab (full of hair and fat) wanting to be outside, compared to a dalmation, jack russell or Doubermand(sp?) in -30 degree weather .. Did you provide the dog with a suitable shelter? Knowing you I bet he had a palace to get out of the elements in.. or if it got to uncomfortable for him he would come to the door... Not to mention you did not keep him chained on a 20 leash with nowhere to find natural shelter...  My family had a hobby farm for years.. and the Dog NEVER came in.. but had full run of the barn and had access to it..... this is alot different then being confined in a 30x30 back yard with a chain link fence...  That is what we see here.  G"
195180,irishfield,2008-05-01 22:22:00,26272,Had a big Iglo.. and never went in it. Snow bank = happy. When he was 10 and getting slower I put a doggy door in the hangar and he went in there to get out of the wind... laid on three layers of cardboard and a furniture moving blanket. Still -30... but no wind. He liked the radio on too.. lol  Clamp-it talks of room to roam vs stress of city folks dogs. Like many things maybe we all need to sit back and look at the big picture. If that environment is too stressful.. should we be putting the animals thru it?? Nothing erks me more than seeing a couple King Sheppards coming out of a one bedroom apartment.
195192,Garry2Rs,2008-05-01 22:51:00,1425,"Hi Cory; Yes my thoughts are based on Cesar Millan's theories. Anyone who has watched the ""Dog Whisperer"" will recognize those parts. I was so impressed by his show that I bought his book. Garry2rs"
195209,dsn,2008-05-01 23:11:00,1018,I think the dog treats from a grocery store should be safe enough. But Lets see what she decides to do.    Thanks for all the amazing responses.  dsn

195314,Gravyboat,2008-05-02 02:30:00,44,"Hey, there's this cat around our place that keeps spraying our house doors.  This, in turn, causes our house cats (both fixed females) to pee by the door.  This cat is owned buy the lowlife accross the street, but not cared for.  I've thought of a few things.  A 2x4 with nails in it... anti freeze... a bag of rocks.  Anyways, as you can tell, no good ideas.  So I called the SPCA.  They said they won't get the cat.  I said, can I live trap it.  They said yes, BUT if the cat is hurt in any ways (and by hurt, they mean that even a stressed out cat is hurt), I could be charged.  So, I said this, and I quote... ""So you won't come get the cat, but if I trap the cat, and bring it to you, and its hurt or tramatized, you'll charge me?""  They said yes.  So I replied ""So what you're telling me to do is trap the cat myself, put it in a bag with some rocks and throw it in the river at night?""  They got a little annoyed."
195320,huntervasili,2008-05-02 02:37:00,1604,  Now that there is funny. I am not a cat lover
195412,brickNblock,2008-05-02 12:38:00,598,"I've always been a dog owner since I was a pup........ My wife the same as are all our children...we love dogs! Every now and then you either own or come across a dog that is a barker. Currently and for the last 6 years we've been proud owners to a 90lb Black Lab/Rotty cross. Our property..(Not near as big as some)...is an an acre without fences, a river on one side and a highway on the opposite side. We get along with all the neighbours for the most part as folks do.....but there was a time I had to have words with one that is immediately beside us.  This neighbour would and still does throw our dog BBQ leftovers everytime he BBQs.....you'd figure my dog would love him silly. Because of that one day I had words with the neighbour....... Our dog agressively barks at him for about 10 seconds every freaking day....then stops. The neighbour and I laugh about it..and he laughs at the dog for doing it but he wont step onto our property anymore either unless I have walked him onto it myself. I figure my dog is doing his job...WELL! He is also allowed to roam our property and also never leaves it at anytime..... The dog is brought in every night tho.....sleeps on the floor on my side of the bed....but, is certainly my wifes dog and protector. The neighbour would never come to our property again if just my wife is outside..I like this too! Funny thing tho....the dog will not/does not bark at the neighbours wife or visiting older kids of theirs...lol. For your problem...if youve already spoken to the neighbours without success. You best start my calling the by-law officer first.... 'Squeaky wheel"" gets the grease they say. I'd deff. stay away from feeding their dog anything including treats or anything else if the dogs owner is not there to see it...PERIOD. I'd do more then bark at you if you did."

Perhaps they were annoyed because they had plans to fish that body of water and had little or no intention of casting for or to, a burlap bag... unless the bag contained marshmellows of course. HH"
195447,Kirk,2008-05-02 13:57:00,347,"How can the SPCA know if a cat is stressed out?  Do they have a therapist that conducts an interview?  Or do you just check for overt symptoms, like the cat is chain smoking and is more irritable?  Other thing is how can SPCA tell how long a cat has been in the trap?  impossible without unbiased and credible witnesses, or would they just ask the cat?"
195454,Billy Bob,2008-05-02 14:14:00,5865,Would throwing a cat in a burlap bag filled with rocks turn him into a catfish
195511,maybe,2008-05-02 16:39:00,307,"I've got to chime in to back up Rick & Garry.  They've hit the nail on the head - this woman needs to learn about how dogs communicate.  They want to cooperate, and don't just yap for the sake of being noisy.  My chosen guru is Dr Stanley Coren, from the show ""Good Dog!,"" companion site ""Good Dog Zone,"" and several books.  Not only has he done a wealth of research into dog behaviour, and proven to be a very gentle & successful trainer, but he's also a Dr & professor of human psychology.  I think that puts him in an excellent position to understand the animal, and translate its world into human terms.  Coren's book ""How To Speak Dog:  Mastering the Art of Dog-Human Communication"" is absolutely brilliant.  I've always gotten along well with furballs, but the difference was night and day once I read this.  It's not unusual for me now to walk into a house with an ""uncontrollable"" dog, and have it behave politely.  FWIW, dogs tell their pups to pipe down by using one soft, low-pitched bark.  I use the word ""enough"" in a low voice without much punch in it.  Amazes me how many people start yelling at the dog - to the animal, it looks like the human's barking its head off, so they must be doing the right thing by barking themselves."
195101,LeXXington,2008-05-01 20:04:00,1928,"I surpised that someone has not mention this, Find out the dogs name and how the owners tell it too be quiet.  Dogs bark when at people to alert the master, tell it too be quite and show athority, You would really be surprised how many dogs think your in charge and listen.  ~ Treats also help"
195117,Clampet,2008-05-01 20:44:00,1947,"Just wondering - why are all these dogs outside. If they are pets, shouldn't they be inside?"
195121,Gerritt,2008-05-01 20:52:00,6129,  Do you not like to go outside?? Dogs require exercise and fresh air... just as humans do.  They also do their business outside....  G
195125,danbouck,2008-05-01 21:01:00,4380,I have a hard time getting my dogs to come back inside.
195130,Garry2Rs,2008-05-01 21:07:00,1425,"Dogs are pack animals. They need exercise, discipline and affection to be happy and well adjusted. Just like children, dogs need rule, boundaries and limitations...you can call this leadership. Many owners provide lots of affection, but very little exercise and discipline and almost no leadership. In the absence of this strong pack-leader the dog will assume that role unwillingly. This puts terrible stress on the dog, who now feels it must guide and protect all the family members... Since it can't control it's ""Pack"" it becomes increasingly neurotic...seeing everything as a threat. Barking dogs are often those ones who have assumed this role of pack-leader and are feeling tremendous stress. Sadly, talking to the owner might be pointless.  They are not good dog owners and pack leaders...they are not in control of their dog! If they were, the dog wouldn't be allowed to bark at things beyond it's own yard! Meeting the dog and establishing a relationship might work. If you do decide to go this route, the rules are no talk, no look, no touch. Move into the dogs space with confidence and stand still, without looking at the dog, talking too the dog or touching the dog. The dog will come to you and smell you.  Yes they will pay particular attention to your butt! When it's ready, it will initiate contact or simply move away.  The owner can then call the dog over and intoduce you. Remember to ""Walk Tall"" stand upright, with shoulders back, and ignore the dog while it checks you out. You want to appear as a strong leader who owns their own space. Dogs recognize this strength.  Afterward, they will not feel threatened by your strong presence next-door. Garry2rs"

195135,Clampet,2008-05-01 21:16:00,1947," Something wrong with you (again)? Of course, dogs go outside. But they should be brought in afterwards. Do U leaver yer dog out all night?"
195138,Gerritt,2008-05-01 21:20:00,6129,  huh?? wrong with me??  and any person that leaves their dogs out all night is not a caring or responsible dog owner..  G
195154,Billy Bob,2008-05-01 21:44:00,5865,Some dogs are just uncontrollable and that's just that. Just like some people are uncontrollable.  No one should have to put up with constant dogs barking at all hours of the day or night. PERIOD.  I have had several dogs in my lifetime with the last one for 13 years. Good dog owners don't let their dogs constantly bark at any hours through out the 24 hour day. Some people work nights and have to sleep days. Once we start justifying why it's OK for a dog to bark for hours on end we have failed as dog owners. And I don't care if they scare off so called burglars once in the blue moon because they are scarring off the quality of life daily for everyone else.  If communication fails between the owner and the local authorities I wouldn't hesitate to take the manner into my own hands.  I hope you can get this resolved and start enjoying the back yard again.  Bob
195157,Clampet,2008-05-01 21:46:00,1947," Is that all you can contribute, some snide little remark, you must think yer relly smart. Better stick ta the hard drives."
195163,mbac31,2008-05-01 21:56:00,904,"  My wife would sooner leave me outside than my dogs. I have less roghts than them. Dogs are like family, still they are just dogs but very easy to please.  One of my beagles gets angry and hides my shoes when I dont take him out with me. They are funny creatures. I bring them out to the park, or even just to the corner store for milk if I have to, keps them happy."
194580,JohnF,2008-04-30 21:07:00,3494," There, ya went and drug up another memory.  Way back when I was a neophyte real estate salesman I was scheduled to do an open house at a place in the country on a miserable snowy night when no one in their right mind would venture out to look at houses. I arrived at the established time, used the provided key to get into the house (the owners had gone out for the evening) and set up my materials. Then I went to the basement recroom (where the tv was ) and settled into the comfiest chair to wait out the clock.  Time for a little background - these folks raised St. Barnyards, big sumbitches that did stuff like pulling in the Iditerod for fun. They took huge pride in telling how one of their pups was one of the Cujo dogs in the movie of the same name and that particular thought was first and foremost in my mind as I sat in the near dark in their funky little basement. The movie wasn't that old at the time.  Back to the story - so I'm sitting watching the only channel they've got on their antenna in those days when I hear this kinda huffing snotty noise from beside my chair. At first I thought it was just the wind but then I heard it again. It sounded too juicy to be just the wind. I twisted around and looked down between the chair and the wall -  - there was the biggest damned St.Barnyard I'd ever seen - bloodshot eyes that could have transfused the victims of a double bus collision, a head that would overflow a bushel basket and enough snot to supply all the Pike in Lake Ontario dripping from his nose. I'm glad I was younger then, because my heart went into instant hyperdrive. All I could think was CUJO.  It's just a funny recollection now, but it was over the top scary that night. I was actually afraid to move for a while. I even offered up a little prayer that some potential house buyer would just walk in and the behemoth would go after them, at least long enough for me to escape.  You may have gotten the impression by now that I'm not a big time dog lover - you'd be exactly on the money, and that was a crappy experience. Mebbe ya had to be there to understand.  JF"
194584,mikeh,2008-04-30 21:13:00,824,"I'd suggest talking to the neighbor. Maybe calling the dog by name and getting him used to her voice. I wouldn't suggest feeding him anything unless it was cleared by the neighbor. Another idea might be to get to know the dog by petting it when the neighbor is present again getting it to know her voice.  We had a dog as kids growing up that would bark at the neighbor, in his yard until he came over to pet it at the chain link fence."
194592,Tinman,2008-04-30 21:19:00,376,"We used the treats and it works, dogs are creatures of habit, you feed it each time you come out, they eat and are good with ya"

If I'm home I put a stop to it, if I'm not home most of the neighbors just tell the dogs to shut up and they listen.  The neighbor behind me who is most affected has taken the time to talk to me and get to know the dogs, and now they go running when she comes out as she usually has a cookie for them   they've also managed to get the new girl who is very nervous to take treats and she goes and lies down when they tell her to be quiet....most neighbors here also know the dogs names.
