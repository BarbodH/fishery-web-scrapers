The announcement  where it will be held will happen tomorrow morning. I guess most news outlets will have the location. Good luck if you get in on this one.  Hey Cliff (ccmt) have you got the scoop, my daughter is not home. LOL"
195215,jonnybass,2008-05-01 23:21:00,346,  1)I wonder how long the line-up of cars will be. 2)I wonder how long before they run out of Gas!
195229,irishfield,2008-05-01 23:46:00,26272,5oth anniversary celebration for gas bars.. Time for Leah to call her Godparents and get the scoop!
195318,ccmtcanada,2008-05-02 02:32:00,7971,"First I've heard of it....I can find out tomorrow.....  Mind you, because I work for the company, I cant tell you where unless it's public knowledge....LOL."
195339,irishfield,2008-05-02 03:15:00,26272,"Is the first gas bar still there..don't think so?? If not will probably be one close to it I'd think....  First gas bar opens at Yonge & Church in Toronto. Gas bar customers receive discount coupons, later known as Canadian Tire 'Money', redeemable in merchandise at Canadian Tire stores. (1958)"
195370,motv8tr,2008-05-02 10:18:00,2587,"It's a City TV promotion, only one station and I think it's at Mavis just south of the 401, end at 9am I believe, just throw on City TV or 680 News.  Maureen"
195371,Roy,2008-05-02 10:39:00,13728, So what year was it that they straightened out Church street so that it no longer crosses Yonge?
195374,Gerritt,2008-05-02 11:08:00,6129,"it is in Mississauga.... and the lineups are hundreds of cars..    Friday, May 02, 2008 - 07:00 AM By: Carl Hanstke and 680News staff   Click here to find out more!    A Mississauga Canadian Tire gas station is offering half price gas. Police are directing traffic while hundreds of people are lined up for 68 cents a litre at the corner of Mavis Rd. and Britannia Rd. The event is sponsored by Breakfast Television and 680News is there.  One person told 680News, ""I am sure I will save save $20.00 for my car, so it is well worth the wait for me.""  Another person driving a Hummer told 680News that is he is willing to wait as long as it takes, in order to cut his regular $140.00 in half.  In general it seems that the bigger the gas tank, the longer people are willing to wait.  G"
195401,Stoty,2008-05-02 12:17:00,2910," I'm sorry, but if you can afford to drive a Hummer, then you can afford the gas to put in it. Suck it up rich boy!"
195444,Pachone,2008-05-02 13:49:00,276,Yeah I heard on the news this morning that it was down to 63 cents a litre at Canadian Tire Gas Bars. LINE UPS down the street and Police officers were governing it because there was fights over gas i remember when we thought 60 cents was the end of the world
195463,irishfield,2008-05-02 14:29:00,26272, LOL Roy... twas thinkin that when I copied and pasted...
195464,irishfield,2008-05-02 14:33:00,26272, Stoty... have you ever priced a hummer to see they really aren't that expensive compared to many SUV's and burn gas no differently than most. And no I don't own one.. not into vehicles design with a straight edge ruler.
195472,SlowPoke,2008-05-02 14:45:00,2984, You prefer something more curvasious? 
195476,irishfield,2008-05-02 14:52:00,26272,LOL... I only drive those as an actor Brian !
195477,BillM,2008-05-02 14:52:00,17367,Idle in line for hours to save $20..  Some people just don't get it.
195482,Stoty,2008-05-02 15:01:00,2910,"I meant the real hummers, not the ""H3"". I agree though, HORRIBLE looking vehicles."
195484,irishfield,2008-05-02 15:03:00,26272, I doubt the army is lined up for fuel in Mississauga...
195486,Stoty,2008-05-02 15:07:00,2910,"LOL, I knew someone would say that!  Not the Hum-V's, the H1's  "
195568,jonnybass,2008-05-02 19:44:00,346,I think he's talking about the Hummers before GM injected it's inferior genes into the line.
