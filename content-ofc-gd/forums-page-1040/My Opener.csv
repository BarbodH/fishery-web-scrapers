194232,Paulus,2008-04-30 02:33:00,522,"I'm so tired I can barely keep my eyes open.  Hit three rivers since Saturday, and here is a portion of the results. Thank the GODS for the rain we had Monday. It helped!  Hope everyone had a good opener, too!  Enjoy the pics             cheers! p.-"
194233,MJL,2008-04-30 02:39:00,2427,Beautiful!  Especially love the first two pics but all the fish are gorgeous.  Congrats on a successful opener.  What kind of camera did you use to take the pics?
194235,ccmtcanada,2008-04-30 02:43:00,7971,"Man....you not only catch fish, but the pics you take are AMAZING!  One of the best on this board in my opinion.  Awesome report.....awesome fish....just plain awesome."
194248,PickerelHunter,2008-04-30 02:56:00,100,awesome awesome pics.  Still yet to try this steelheading thing.
194251,canadian_copper,2008-04-30 02:59:00,925,NICELY DONE BRO
194278,solopaddler,2008-04-30 08:54:00,8605,"I agree, excellent pic's, very sharp. As far as what camera Paul used, I'm not sure, only know that it's a huge ungainly thing that's a pain to lug around and requires it's own personal backpack  . (the results are pretty sweet though)"
194295,fatherof3,2008-04-30 11:29:00,1769,"awesome shots,congrats on all the fish"
194338,Paulus,2008-04-30 13:49:00,522," Thanks MJL  The camera is an old Minolta Z1 (with 10x Zoom). Minolta's digital cam arm was bought up by Sony, so I'm afraid these aren't around anymore. Mind you, I hear that it was their best model overall. Later models had defects. It's still an excellent camera, even though I dropped it in the water last year (argh!!!!  ) and there are a few water spots that show up in the lens whenever the sun shines in it at a certain angle. Still, better than nothing!  p.-"
194340,Paulus,2008-04-30 13:54:00,522," Hehe, you make it sound like a bazooka, Mike!  It's definitely not pocket sized by any means. But I've abandoned the backpack in favor of just tucking it inside the top of my chest waders. Easy access, quick snap, release fish.  Thanks for the compliments everyone, I'm glad to find people who appreciate my pics  Heading out to another trib soon. Hopefully there'll be more where that came from  p.-"
194359,Golfisher,2008-04-30 14:38:00,586,Beauty pics!
194369,highdrifter,2008-04-30 15:05:00,2534,WOW.  Best fish porn ever..  That second shot is making me feel kinda funny..  mmhhmmmm  thanx! HD
194798,Paulus,2008-05-01 02:35:00,522," Thanks Drifter. It's only the second time I manage to make that kind of shot work. Both were in the early morning, so maybe lighting has something to do with it.  This one (below) took me more than 20 minutes to land & must've been more than 12lbs. She would have been more for sure, in the fall. I couldn't believe that the tippet held as long as it did, or the hook which basically slipped out after I got her in. One of the best battles I've had in a long time: ""mmmhhmmmmmm"" as you so truthfully put it    p.-"
194821,bpsbassman,2008-05-01 03:22:00,941,Those are absolutely amazing shots Paulus.  Unbelievable colours on those beauties. Well Done!!
195027,jdmls,2008-05-01 17:07:00,575,"well worth luggin the big camera around.....as Cliff said, your steelehead pics are pretty much second to none on this board.....I try some of the effects and angles you and Mike take but I am far from getting anything this good...my 6MGPX digi just doesn't have the capabilities ,and being a novice at photography doesn't help....GREAT POST keep it up  I think I found a new wallpaper "
195058,mepps,2008-05-01 19:08:00,1301,great photos!
