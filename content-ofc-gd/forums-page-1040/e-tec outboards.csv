195384,Randy,2008-05-02 11:22:00,115,Going into my 2nd year with a 50HP etec. No problems so far. Nice quiet motor and very fuel efficient compared to by old 2 stroke.

195522,Reelpro,2008-05-02 17:25:00,73,"Into my 2nd yr with a 200HP on a 22' boat. Motor is awesome, less fuel consumption than an eqaul size fourstroke. Quiet, no smoke, sips oil.  If it holds together, will be best 1 yet.  did hear of a 2007, with 500 plus hrs, that blew the powerhead. Guy that was chartering daily on Erie.  [emailÂ protected]"
