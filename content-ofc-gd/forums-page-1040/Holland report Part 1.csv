Nice airline for a flyin trip   Over the Atlantic somewhere east of England   Setting up on the beach for some low tide night fishing   This reel was an Okuma but most were Shimano 10000 just huge reels   All set up waiting for fish. The rods are on stands about 5' high. We were using about 4oz weights and a home made kind of super sized double pickeral rig (weight on the bottom 2 dropper lines)   One of 5 small cod we caught. I got this guy and another about the same size. Too early in the year for sea bass.   Saturday afternoon we went to one of the shipping channels near Europoort (Europe's largest container port)   Little John working hard with a big casting rod   Watching the ships come and go   Theo and John with the only cod we got, one of three we saw caught that day    jjcanoe   Part 2 to follow"

Did you hit up any of the Herring carts? Mmmmmmmmm.....  Again an awesome report!  Ohhh yeah the WC Soccer game had me torn! But I am more Dutch then Portuguese as my mom is adopted...
