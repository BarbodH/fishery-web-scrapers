I will provide some burgers and hot dogs, pop and coffee, bring your spouses and kids.  Please give me an idea if you will be coming and how many so I can make sure to have enough food and stuff available.  Big Cliff"
194737,Sinker,2008-05-01 00:52:00,8692,"I can't say for sure Cliff. My dad is going to be here this weekend. I""m not sure what his plans are yet. I know he's itching to get at his boat at the marina, so if we're in the area, we'll come by and see if your still around.  If anything changes, and I can make it for sure, I'll let ya know for sure.  Sinker"
194739,ccmtcanada,2008-05-01 01:01:00,7971,"Bly and I will be there with our little one....  My checklist is chest waders, fishing gear.....anything else?"
194741,Dondorfish,2008-05-01 01:08:00,1000,Hey Cliff - i plan on being available - but I don't have any waders - could I still be of assistance?   Don  
194745,ccmtcanada,2008-05-01 01:12:00,7971, Hey Don....  What size shoe do you wear?  I have an extra pair of size 9 waders.....
194747,Dondorfish,2008-05-01 01:13:00,1000,   LOL - Size 9   Thanks Cliff   Don  
194749,ccmtcanada,2008-05-01 01:14:00,7971, Done then...I'll bring them up!!  See you Sunday Don...looking forward to it.
194750,Dondorfish,2008-05-01 01:17:00,1000,I'll be coming from Fowlers Corners if anyone needs a lift along the way.  Don   
194752,Big Cliff,2008-05-01 01:20:00,6899,"I also have spare waders, size 10 I think! I have all the tools we will need. Sinker, even if you can't get here to help, bring your dad by for a visit and a burger, the work won't take long but the G2G lasts until the last one leaves.  Beans, I could probably use some help on the BBQ if you are available!"
194766,Sinker,2008-05-01 01:45:00,8692,"  If we're up there on sunday, we'll stop in for sure.  I may be able to make it to help, it just depends what the old boy wants to do that day. I'll let ya know for sure either way.  Sinker"
194830,Beans,2008-05-01 03:35:00,3339,"I will more than likely be there...  I think Meely and Tony may drop by also if'n they are not too busy at the ""Manor""...  I'll throw my waders in the back of the wagon...size 10 methinks..."
194868,motv8tr,2008-05-01 10:27:00,2587,Sorry but I'm back to work that day   Hope all goes well for you ...  Maureen

194873,wuchikubo,2008-05-01 11:17:00,1114,"Hey Cliff,  It doesn't appear that I'll be able to make it as the Misses had already made plans for the family. Unless it changes, I'll have to meet up some other time.  Stan"
194927,ecmilley,2008-05-01 13:57:00,2163,"Cliff can't promise right anything right now, but if I get what needs to be done around my place sat night sunday morning I'll be there to lend a hand"
195173,Big Cliff,2008-05-01 22:08:00,6899,"Many thanks to all, looking forward to seeing all that can come even if it is only for a burger and a visit! There isn't a lot of work, just too much for one old man LOL."
195179,nancur373,2008-05-01 22:19:00,1211,Whereabouts is it guys? If it's not too far the wife and I could help.
195205,JeffBornFishin,2008-05-01 23:06:00,260,"TangledLines and I can come out Sunday.  Yes we are married  Will be nice to meet everyone, give a hand and have a visit.  Got one set of waders to bring.  Send a pm where you are located."
195241,Big Cliff,2008-05-01 23:59:00,6899,"Address is 313 Snug Harbour Rd. Lindsay  It is off Hwy 36  If coming along 401 going East exit 115/35, go North and follow 35 to first set of stop lights, that will be Hwy. 7. Turn right on 7 for about 1.5 km (first set of lights) which is 36, turn left on 36. go North on 36 about 9 km to Snug Harbour Rd. Turn left on Snug Harbour Rd and continue for about 3.5 km to 313. Phone is 705-328-0750 I would like to start about 10:00 am so we can get the docks in and enjoy some time together. Bring your kids and fishing rods if you would like, there are plenty of pan fish to be caught right off the dock. I'll have burgers and hot dogs, pop and coffee or tea. Burgers and hot dogs will be served around noon. Stay as long as you like, G2G ends when the last person goes home LOL.  About the only rule we have around here is no smoking in the house. If it gets cold or too wet, there is lots of room in the house to warm up or dry off.  Please RSVP if you are coming so I can make sure we have enough food.  Cliff"
195251,nancur373,2008-05-02 00:42:00,1211,Thanks for the directions. The wife doesn't want to drive that far on Sunday. Her and our 15 month old son have been very sick this week. Getting better now but they're not the most energetic. I'm sure you'll get plenty of help.
195272,Big Cliff,2008-05-02 01:13:00,6899,"nancur373, thanks for thinking about helping, there will be other times. Hope both your wife and baby are feeling better really soon!"
