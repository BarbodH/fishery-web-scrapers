195640,Gerritt,2008-05-02 22:18:00,6129,Wow! Either he did not have a Cow/Calf license... or his heart was beating to hard and fast to pull the string back.... the bloody thing had the bolt in its mouth!!  Crazy!  G
195642,ccmtcanada,2008-05-02 22:20:00,7971,"Incredible footage!  Once it got up close and personal, I was really hoping I didn't see that animal go down.  Great find...thanks for posting the link."
195643,DanTheMan,2008-05-02 22:21:00,257,"If you really look fast at the end, I beleive he pulls back his bow then, hard to tell, but I think he does/ Could you imagine your hearbeat!!! (lol)"
195644,jonnybass,2008-05-02 22:21:00,346, OMG!!!  That moose actually licked the arrow!!!  I wonder if the guy shot the moose after that. I would have let it go just for being so bold!
195648,tip-up,2008-05-02 22:25:00,94,"That's wild! WOW  She deserved to walk back into the bush   ...Well, I would hope. I have been able to walk right up to a few wild deer on a neighbors property and actually touch them on the head without them dashing off. Someone must be feeding them.  That's really cool. Thanks for sharing."
195651,misfish,2008-05-02 22:28:00,29133,"Thats what it,s all about.Up and close and a memory that he will never forget. Loved it 110%."
195656,Gerritt,2008-05-02 22:34:00,6129,  Seen this before.... and it is the worst clip on youtube.... I wish the lion took his bloody head off... PS... one guide that has a decent shot.. all the rest are amateurs. Hope it made a nice carpet..  G
195659,ccmtcanada,2008-05-02 22:39:00,7971,"You ever see those insurance ads on TV recently?  The ones about how some people ""Really dont like insurance salespeople?""  One of the has a guide telling a bunch of scuba divers that the sharks swimming around were actually dolphins, and sends them all in the water.  He then throws raw meat all around them and takes off.....  The other one I believe is the people are on safari and there are lions and other BIG cats around.  As soon as he finds out that they are in insurance, he tells them to disembark...go and pet them....they are really friendly....  Anyhow...off topic I know, but Gerritt's post reminded me of it...."
195660,SlowPoke,2008-05-02 22:42:00,2984,I would have missed the shot from that range.
195662,tip-up,2008-05-02 22:45:00,94,"LOL, I seen that coming. Sorry for this Dan, I will remove the link. For your information the lion was a problem cat in the area and had taken a few lives before it was shot down ...then again, all youtube clips have a new story...I don't think it was the worst video on YouTube...I guess if the lion were to maul the hunter it would have made for better action right???"
195664,danbo,2008-05-02 22:48:00,2646,Tres magnifique!!

195671,walleyejigger,2008-05-02 23:06:00,876,"good stuff Dan, checked out some other videos,  ""Quelle course"" is a great laugh, aven't laughed that hard in a while  ""Peche magnifique"" is pretty neat too although unlawful (commentary is awesome if you understand french)"
195675,Tinman,2008-05-02 23:30:00,376,thats was some great footage!
195689,Mike01,2008-05-03 00:06:00,378,That is amazing...
195742,Paulus,2008-05-03 02:26:00,522,"Foudroyant, Dan. Je ne l'aurais jamais cru autrement!!!  I loved it & watched it several times. That's what it's all about. It must have taken incredible calm to just let her walk up like that. Here... just the tip  l'orignal a du se dire apres ca... 'crisse, ca a passe proche!'  p.-"
