195033,jdmls,2008-05-01 17:14:00,575,"Two reasons :  -one cause this fish came out of a hole that I have tried every year on the opener and has never produced fish in the late afternoon...She took a worm in the last place I would of suspected fish to be sitting..what a suprise when i set the hook !!  -second cause my Islander fit into the pic so nicely, LOL....  "
193858,l2p,2008-04-29 15:57:00,346,Post your favorite opener pic from this year.  Wasnt my biggest fish but this one hit during a hard rain we got saturday afternoon along with the thunder and lightning. Soon as i tamed her the clouds opened up and the sun shined through just for this pic.    *Btw if anyone wants to hook up this week and doesnt mind pickin me up from scarb pm me i can throw down for some gas.*    l2p

193888,Billy - Curtiss,2008-04-29 18:19:00,241,"Man, I'm daft! Somebody please enlighten me?!"
193890,Stoty,2008-04-29 18:21:00,2910,"Hey man,  Use the ""Insert Image"" button that is just above the text box, where you enter your post. (to the left of the Smiley face) Then just copy and paste the image URL in there."
193901,Billy - Curtiss,2008-04-29 18:35:00,241,"'Sorry, dynamic pages in the  tags are not allowed'  This is all I get. I don't understand. I was able to link to my photo bucket page before."
193902,Stoty,2008-04-29 18:38:00,2910,"Ohhhh, ok. Its a dynamic page because of the & sign in the URL. You need to have a direct link to the picture eg (www.yourwebsite.com/images/Picture.jpg) The facebook URLS are all dynamic because Facebook is too large to have individual pages for every members pictures.  Try uploading the picture to photo bucket or some location where you can give the direct link.  (Hope this makes sense)"
193903,Victor,2008-04-29 18:38:00,1609,billy - curtiss --> i don't think you can paste facebook pics here ... people who's viewing it needs to be logged onto facebook... not sure though... i tried pasting the link you got into my browser and it asked me to log in.  I caught my first ever steelhead on sunday as well ... fish took off before i could get a pic though
193905,Billy - Curtiss,2008-04-29 18:46:00,241,"It won't even let me post it from my photo bucket account. This is frustrating.  <img src=""http://s166.photobucket.com/albums/u114/Bloodsurf/?action=view&current=IMG_4085.jpg"">  "
193907,Victor,2008-04-29 18:53:00,1609,here ya go  
193908,Billy - Curtiss,2008-04-29 18:54:00,241,"Yes! Thanks dude! Now, how the heck did you do that?!"
193909,Victor,2008-04-29 18:55:00,1609,"when you click into your photobucket page ... on the right you will see that it gives you 4 different ""link options"" ... i.e. ""Shared URL"", ""Direct Link"", ""HTML code"", ""IMG code""  what you need here, is the ""IMG code"" ... when you do a post, just copy that line and you'll be fine. As it already has the  tags in it, you won't need to click the ""insert image"" button as what Stoty told you.  if you have more problems, let me know"
193910,Victor,2008-04-29 18:56:00,1609,"o by the way, nice fish!  i can't tell you how excited i was when i got my first one either !"

194215,kemper,2008-04-30 01:43:00,2232,  Not because of the size...because of the battle she gave me!
194249,ehg,2008-04-30 02:57:00,2666,Casted a Panther Martin for about 15 minutes on Sunday afternoon. Caught my first brookie of '08. Thing about it was that it took about 30 minutes to drive from downtown Toronto to spot where it was caught. 
194270,l2p,2008-04-30 06:08:00,346,"nice brookie. youd be surprised how much ""brookie waters"" are within a half hour drive from toronto. keep the pics comin!"
