195594,MuddyWater,2008-05-02 21:07:00,218,after some adventuring in parts unknown me and the cuz found mr and mrs speckle trout that were happily waiting for our worms. and a small brownie peace  
195595,jonnybass,2008-05-02 21:10:00,346,"Nice fish. Are fish like the ones you caught generally only found way up stream? Also, was the brown a resident brown or a fish that's ""growing up"" before heading back to Lake O and how can you tell the difference?"
195603,MuddyWater,2008-05-02 21:22:00,218,brookies around here are natural and reproduce only in streams. most browns will get to a size of around 2lbs and take off downstream to lake O. some browns hang in streams for a long time like the 4-5lb resident i got last year and my camera battery died LOL seriously.
195605,l2p,2008-05-02 21:27:00,346,"nice fish, and yes in most cases brookies can only be found on the head waters of the creeks. from what ive noticed most lake run browns lack the orange dots and halos that most resies have."
195607,johnnyb,2008-05-02 21:29:00,3413,beauty brookie!
195608,jonnybass,2008-05-02 21:29:00,346,So I'm assuming that specs and Steelhead don't ever share the same water at the same time. That's what I meant by wayyyy up stream.
195615,l2p,2008-05-02 21:41:00,346,it depends on the trib your fishing. sometimes the steelhead are not aloud that far up(dams) but witnessed one case where a buddy of mine actually hooked a brookie in a pool full of steelhead.
195620,MuddyWater,2008-05-02 21:50:00,218,i caught a small brookie while bow fishing below the tracks in a eastern trib!!! IT HAD LAKE COLOURS!!!! makes you wonder doesnt it?
195635,Billy - Curtiss,2008-05-02 22:11:00,241,Them specks sure are purdy!

195704,canadian_copper,2008-05-03 00:31:00,925,NICE FISH BRO!!!
195736,ehg,2008-05-03 01:58:00,2666,"Ya it does make you wonder. Fished for brookies and resident browns for last 25 yrs. and have seen their range shrink immensely especially in Ganaraska tribs. Something about opening up upper reaches of tribs. for rainbow trout,(which are introduced, almost invasive) which has out competed native brookies for habitat and food.  Catching a lake run 'chrome' brookie shouldn't be unusual, thats the way it was before urban encroachment, introduced species, and too many people.  Nice fish, that first one is big.  ehg"
195754,kemper,2008-05-03 03:23:00,2232,awesome!  Ill be heading out myself tomorrow morning in search of some speckles
195761,Ramble,2008-05-03 03:54:00,713,Beautful fish. Congrats
195764,Musky or Specks,2008-05-03 04:04:00,2710,Do your steelheading on the tribs of Superior and we always catch brookies while fishin bows.Thats a nice brace of specks there muddy
