195267,Roy,2008-05-02 01:07:00,13728,"Well, I think that everyone has been very tolerant with the hockey scrimmages on here. I know that passions flare at this time of the year, every year, and I'm sure that everyone undestands that. However, being a bigot in this community is not acceptable. Holdfast, I've said it before, folks are not jumping down your throat because you served our country and everyone appreciates it. Get over it Bud. It was your choice. If you don't like a particular brand of human being, that's your choice also. But, NOT in our community. Get some help Bubba."
195268,workwear,2008-05-02 01:07:00,592,remind me to never bring up the habs or marshmellows ever again
195270,jonnybass,2008-05-02 01:09:00,346,Who are the bigots on here and who are they racist against???
195271,danbouck,2008-05-02 01:12:00,4380,  Note to self: Keep hockey and steelheading to myself
195273,jonnybass,2008-05-02 01:13:00,346,I'm sooooo confused
195278,Greencoachdog,2008-05-02 01:21:00,8163,... soooooooo? Does anybody on this thread ever go fishin'?
195297,Gerritt,2008-05-02 02:00:00,6129,"Wow..... Just Wow.... Holdfast... we all know you do not care for Europeans... you have made that well known on probably 80-90% of your posts... somehow you find away to slam them in any given topic.. While I appreciate that you have served our Country (as Roy stated) you are out of line here as you are in many of your posts... Being a Canadian of European decent myself (Both Parents right off the boat) I find your comments no better then those that complain about other races on this board... the only difference is you are colour blind... you hate anyone not born in bum truck Alberta, in a trailer down by the river... I have let my feeling known to you in the past that you are a racist weather you think so or not... you are a bigot and a racist... it is ok.. you probably cannot help it..   No Different then Bashing Natives, Asians, Blacks or Muslims for that matter....   Tell you what.. Here is a white bucket.. shove it up your  G."

195308,bigfish1965,2008-05-02 02:18:00,3382,"If it becomes impossible for you guys to talk hockey without your brains becoming dislodged from your brain stem, please refrain from saying anything. This thread is done and so is any hockey thread that gets stupid...even remotely stupid. This is just immature and stupid. Grow up."
195082,Stoty,2008-05-01 19:38:00,2910," HAHAHAHAHAH   Penguins....thats true they are not a physical team, but they dont have to be. They know how to handle physical tams. Thats the difference between them and MTL. Yes PHI will get beat by PIT next round for sure.  Being down 2 games to 1 in PHI...thats not the right time to give a wake up call. Look what is cost them."
195084,lookinforwalleye,2008-05-01 19:39:00,4399,  I figure game 7 should be over at about 9:30 next Tuesday I expect your humble appology no later than 10 PM. LOL
195085,lookinforwalleye,2008-05-01 19:41:00,4399,  Okay Your crazy!!!!
195086,xrap,2008-05-01 19:42:00,683,"  Ofc, I'm a leafs fan!!!!!!"
195088,lookinforwalleye,2008-05-01 19:45:00,4399, You have my deepest sympathies!
195093,anders,2008-05-01 19:54:00,1168,"How come no talk of a rangers come back?   lol....  I think the penguins have been fortunate to face mediocure (sp) goaltending so far these playoffs, and when they run into Philly, i think they are going to be a little surprised, and by the time they figure it out, they will be on the outside looking in.  Like it was said before, you can get a lot of shots in a game but if they arent quality shots, the goalie is just going to get a lot more comfortable back there.  when a goalie doesn't get tested as much he isnt as sharp.  was it a good idea to start Halak...i think so, Price has only won 2 games since game 4 of the opening round."
195097,jonnybass,2008-05-01 19:59:00,346, best spot for suckers
195107,Headhunter,2008-05-01 20:12:00,5703,"Philly has taken quite a few hits in the last couple of games and I'm wondering if they will be able to keep up the pace that they have established against the Habs. As last nights game wore on, it seemed to me anyway, that the Philly players were starting to look tired and the physical beating they have been laying on the Habs looks to be taking a toll on the team. Montreal on the other hand appeared to be scared, beaten and demoralized! As far as out shooting the Flyers is concerned, the Habs have Jason Blake syndrom... shoot from far out and hope! HH"
195110,misfish,2008-05-01 20:23:00,29133," I totally agree. They seem to have that""old school hockey""going."
195133,xrap,2008-05-01 21:12:00,683,  Thanks Marshmallow man
195142,Billy - Curtiss,2008-05-01 21:25:00,241,"I happen to think that Pittsburgh will totally decimate Philadelphia. They barely got by Ovechkin and the Capitals. They cannot contend with Crosby, Malkin and Hossa. I guess we'll see how she all goes down soon enough. Stoked for the games tonight!"
195145,xrap,2008-05-01 21:29:00,683,"Yes they did barley beat the caps but the caps were 9-1 in thier last ten games of the season. You  can never judge the playoffs, who remebers the 8th place oilers few years ago? Made it to the finals!"
195148,jonnybass,2008-05-01 21:31:00,346, No problem Marshmallow Nazi
195156,misfish,2008-05-01 21:45:00,29133," Are you NUTZ. (nothing personal here) Sid the kid, will whine like a pig, when he feels the hurt Downey will put on him. Mario,Mario help me. HAHAHAHAHAHA"

195162,muttfish,2008-05-01 21:54:00,20,"you knew the habs couldn't have much gas left after they let the bruins back into that series, the flyers are too physical for the habs, guy should have left price between the pipes because this totally undermines his effort and confidence, the habs are done in 6, the penguins have too much talent and just enough grit and size to get past the flyers in 5, detroit won't get past dallas, the penguins win the cup in 6"
195166,misfish,2008-05-01 22:00:00,29133, 5  GOOD LUCK WITH THAT BET 
195168,jonnybass,2008-05-01 22:04:00,346, Or irrespective.
195243,Stoty,2008-05-02 00:00:00,2910," Oh you mean when he jumps off his feet, or slu-foots him? Mr. Laraque might have something to say about that. I HIGHLY doubt Downey will touch Crosby. But he is guarenteed to give the Pens at least 1 power play per game!"
195248,misfish,2008-05-02 00:28:00,29133," Now that was funny right there.  Yes, Mrs. Laraque  might get a smack,n as well."

195073,carll2,2008-05-01 19:28:00,443,"first of all look at the penguins and there not quite the physical team!!! speed is what counts in the new nhl..and even if the flyers win pittburgh willl have a fun time ripping them in half just like they did to the sens and rangers..as for guy good work on benching price no better way than to try and wake your team up and get your point across, now its up to the players...definately not a cup year for us but then again most of the team are inexpirienced, look at the penguins last year eliminated in the first round...its just lack of expirience no biggie"
195078,xrap,2008-05-01 19:35:00,683,"If Philly  passes, or I should say when they get passed Montreal I think the'll give Pens a really tough time. Call Me crazy but I think Philly is going to the finals?"
