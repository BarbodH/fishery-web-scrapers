Can anyone recommend areas where I can fish from shore for pike? I am located in Barrie.... and will drive up to 1.5 hours. I would really appreciate anyones advice. Thanks!

195697,irishfield,2008-05-03 00:17:00,26272,Actually Hoggs bay is between Port McNicol and Victoria Harbour.. but what's a few miles ! LOL  Shore fishing it is tough though.. pretty much limited to casting from the old Grain Elevator yard in Port. Into Port...go right to the end of the street. Street goes left and Elevator Harbour is on the right. Not sure how much access there is anymore though.. Lock your car twice!
