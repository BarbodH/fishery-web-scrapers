Everyone past 15th has some ground to make up fast if they want to get into contention.  Pretty much every Sens fan is near the bottom and basically out of it - which is totally shocking...  The battle of the Pylons is heating up.  Puckhead's Pylons (13th) had a comfortable lead over Kennymans Pylons (11th) for a good stretch and all of a sudden Kennyman's Pylons have inched ahead by a good 33 points...  Damn.  The Pylon war will be bitter and decisive, sure to go down to the last game.  Plenty of time left to get into the top tier - even for you Sens fans... I picked up almost 310 points the other night."
