I have no experience with trolling or using down riggers and just herd of planner boards... could someone explain how these things work? Ive been explained it but havent seen them in action or used them...could someone provide more info / Diagrams? Thanks! - Pachone"
195465,SlowPoke,2008-05-02 14:33:00,2984,Tin cans can have downriggers too!  Planer boards take your line away from the boat but are similar... replace the cannonball with a board that wants to pull away from the boat.

195470,Billy Bob,2008-05-02 14:43:00,5865,Not to confuse you even more but Dipsy Divers are like a downrigger/planer board combo and has really caught on in Lake Erie for walleye and Ontario for trout/salmon.  They are now my favorite as they are also the least amount of work (i'm a lazy fisherman at times)   not to mention they REALLY help catch fish
195493,Pachone,2008-05-02 15:42:00,276,Great Information. But i dont understand howw downriggers release whens theres a hit? do planners do they same thing? hows does it keep it in? i need to see one in my hands..
195495,douG,2008-05-02 15:51:00,2693,"Downrigger releases look like a clothespin - the line pops free on a strike.  Planer boards can work the same way, sorta.  Do some googling, the truth is out there."
