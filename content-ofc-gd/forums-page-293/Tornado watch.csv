799060,jedimaster,2013-07-19 21:53:00,3472,Entropy I will be on Lake of two rivers. Where are you?
799061,misfish,2013-07-19 21:57:00,29133,"Nick  I have seen funnels Nick. I remember watching my sons football game, and one player yelled funnel. I never seen so many kids and parents run for each other. SCARY STUFF MAN"
799062,Terry,2013-07-19 21:58:00,14456,big tree swinging wildly over my boat is making me nervous
799063,206,2013-07-19 21:58:00,563,"round 2 here in Port hope its  a lot darker and nastier then the one an hour ago, power is flickering as I type, police scanner reporting a tree down as I type as well!!"
799065,misfish,2013-07-19 22:00:00,29133,WARNING ARE BACK. SIGHTING IN BRADFORD.
799066,misfish,2013-07-19 22:03:00,29133, Get out there and cut it down. PROTECT THAT BOAT AT ALL COST.
799068,Tim Mills,2013-07-19 22:06:00,476,"Storm coming thru mississauga now- warnings for area's north of here orangeville, grand valley etc."
799070,206,2013-07-19 22:10:00,563,The second wave came hard but has calmed right down. Hope the good stuff stays to the north!!
799072,Tim Mills,2013-07-19 22:13:00,476,"Nippising getting hit hard, my buddy says the camp down the road from Bear Creek Cottages lost 4 cottages to falling tree's. Hope the people there are safe."
799074,NAW,2013-07-19 22:22:00,4022,"I saw some video from Calanadar, looks a bit messy!"
799081,spincast,2013-07-19 22:41:00,3279,"It just passed by us with a darkening of skies and a quick temp drop - but no funnels. We've been through two of them - 1 camping at Arrowhead when it passed through Barrie / Huntsville - took out several tents and campers all around us but we were unscathed. The next one we were  in Carnarvon about 10 years ago. Weather had been just like this - days of ridiculously hot humid weather. We were lucky that time too - next to a scenic look out and it bounced off the lookout and landed on the other side of the lake doing massive damage.  The kids were blowing bubbles in the driveway: the bubbles  were gently floating going in one direction, stopped dead still for a couple seconds and then went in the complete opposite direction at an incredible rate - it looked like one of those cartoons the way they took off. Then the rain started, in 30 seconds the rain was so fast and hard it was horizontal. It looked like a white sheet had draped across the windows. We huddled in the broom closet in the middle of the cottage. 10 minutes later came out to a war zone. Tree on the van, the cottage next door on either side of us and a forest of trees tossed like match sticks on the far side of the lake. Incredible power."
799102,misfish,2013-07-20 00:14:00,29133,"Holy crap Dave. Thats some crazy stuff.  Just as I start to type,kaboom,thunder,look out and it,s coming back. Thought it was heading TO way?"
799105,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2013-07-20 00:25:00,535," Didn't you just get a new boat, too? You've even got me worried lol."
799114,Tdel,2013-07-20 01:12:00,393,"We lost power for approx. 4 1/2 hrs here in Penetanguishene.  High winds, rain, thunder & lightning. Trees down and Hydro trucks out and about throughout town. Temperature dropped in a matter of minutes from 32C to 20C. Temp started climbing after the sun came out (intermittently) to around 25C and it was very humid."
799117,Big Cliff,2013-07-20 01:37:00,6899,"One touched down in the Kawarthas. Actually I can be more precise, at 313 Snug Harbour Rd. My neighbor now has a new boat house on his property, unfortunatly it was mine. He watched as it picked it up three seperate times then just threw it sideways and on it's side. Lifted the boat right off the marine railway and dumped it on it's side. Boathouse is a write off, he isn't sure but doesn't think there is too much damage to the boat. I guess Sue and I will be cutting this vacation short and heading for home Sunday morning."
799120,woodenboater,2013-07-20 01:49:00,2277,"wow, hope the boat is ok but I guess it could have been worse. time to get the chainsaw out and process some firewood ?"
799125,workwear,2013-07-20 02:03:00,592,sorry to hear that cliff......if ya need a hand...lemme know!!

799144,Entropy,2013-07-20 03:58:00,747,Sorry to hear Cliff.
799168,Sinker,2013-07-20 13:56:00,8692,"Hey Cliff, if you need a hand with anything, get in touch. I'm working the next 9 days straight, but I'm free most evenings. Please, don't be afraid to ask for some help, I'd be happy to do what I can.  S."
799182,Beans,2013-07-20 16:20:00,3339,Damn the luck Cliff...Sorry to hear this old friend...  You must live in a tornado alley...  Seems to me you had a tree come down on your garage not too many years ago...
798990,misfish,2013-07-19 17:33:00,29133,"There are warnings and watches every where in Ontario,BC and Quebec. This is going to get crazy  Not only tornados,but severe winds and thunder storms.  Be safe all.  http://www.theweathernetwork.com/alerts/ca/on"
798991,lew,2013-07-19 17:41:00,12766,"I've been sitting out on the back deck watching this system develope Brian and it sure looks like it could get interesting.  I spose we could all use some much needed rain, but we sure don't need the storms that may come with it."
798992,Rich Clemens,2013-07-19 17:42:00,3131,Sounds like I may be in for a very intersting trip coming up there tomorrow.
798994,jimmer,2013-07-19 17:52:00,2730,"It should be gone by then. They say the temps are dropping tonight, so should the threat of tornados."
798996,Rich Clemens,2013-07-19 18:04:00,3131,Yeah - but it is probably heading down my way.  
799000,Roy,2013-07-19 18:21:00,13728,Tomorrow looks not too bad for you Rich.
799001,misfish,2013-07-19 18:26:00,29133,We have had a lot of high winds today. Along with 4 power surges. I think this is the hottest day so far in the plant. A constant 42 since 9am this morning. bring on the relief.
799005,NAW,2013-07-19 18:42:00,4022,Power is on and off here too B.  Might be in for a wild night!
799006,NAW,2013-07-19 18:44:00,4022,Wife just called and said a Tornado just hit Owensound!
799013,davey buoy,2013-07-19 19:19:00,5505,27 and horseshoe valley  rd. Apparently one touched down
799015,misfish,2013-07-19 19:22:00,29133,"That was an intense drive home from work,even though it was only 15 minutes. Sun skies,turned black in minutes. Heavy rains,and wild winds. Temp at departure of 37 deg. 15 minutes later,25..Getting dark again,it not over yet.  Finally got to turn the air off."
799018,jedimaster,2013-07-19 19:37:00,3472,Just packing up to head up to Algonquin for the weekend. maybe we will stop in barrie or gravenhurst for it to blow over before continuing. Anyone up Barrie - Huntsville?
799021,Muskieman,2013-07-19 19:47:00,2472,a pal just told me that Barrie just got a touchdown as well
799022,jedimaster,2013-07-19 19:50:00,3472,We will be two or 3 hours likely til we hit barrie so hopefully things clear up by then.
799025,misfish,2013-07-19 19:58:00,29133," Is it true they sound like a train???????? Cause I heard a steady noise,that was wierd,but could see anything for the heavy rain."
799027,misfish,2013-07-19 20:12:00,29133,"Just like that,the winds die,the rain stops and the suns trying to come out. Mother nature is so cruel,but have great respect for her."
799029,misfish,2013-07-19 20:21:00,29133," Nothing confirmed here as of yet Randy,and I got rock 95 on. Gravenhurst may have had one."
799032,Cudz,2013-07-19 20:31:00,2652,"That was intense.  I remember back in 1985 when tornado came through and crushed us here in Barrie.  It was darker at that time. Today during the worse part of the storm that just past, I happened to be driving through allendale (that is where the 85 tornado hit).  Not cool.  Managed to get home and in the basement.  Would not be surprised if one or two twisters touched down. Temp went from 35 to 23 in about 15 minutes.  I bet the waterspouts on Kemp were crazy"
799034,Cudz,2013-07-19 20:34:00,2652,Looks like Toronto is going to get hit later this aft/eve around 7pm by another cell
799037,misfish,2013-07-19 20:42:00,29133,  Yer good to go now Jed. Warnings lifted. Have a safe and great trip.
799038,Moosebunk,2013-07-19 20:43:00,3970,Storm is upon us here in Lanark County.  Hoping to not have to pick the gravel out of the ditch again after another driveway washout.  Too much rain this year... but the grass has never been greener.
799046,misfish,2013-07-19 21:10:00,29133,"Spoke to soon Drew,it,s back. Yes the grass sure need it,and the local river could use a good drink. The season is soon."
799050,Entropy,2013-07-19 21:21:00,747,"We are too, where you camping? "
799054,NAW,2013-07-19 21:42:00,4022,"I hear ya about the wild ride home Bri!  I got a call from my wife saying she was heading to the neighbours storm cellar with my 10 month old boy...  So I left work immediately.   Driving up the 400, gettin of at horseshoe, and I hear they just sited a funel cloud at 27 and horseshoe...
