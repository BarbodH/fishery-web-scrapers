Only stayed 4 hours in a heat wave with my girls in tow, largies were non existent and smallies were tough for me.  Walleye guys where trolling through the narrows about midway through the lake that morning.  Closer to the S.W. end in the basin are some shoals and one smaller island.  Smallies found around there on sonar in good numbers with a few dinkeroos caught... water was very clear.  If fishing there again I'd try dropshotting..."
