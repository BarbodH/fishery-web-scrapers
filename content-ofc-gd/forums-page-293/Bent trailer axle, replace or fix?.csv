799482,BillM,2013-07-22 15:58:00,17367,"Looks like the trailer axle took quite the hit on our fishing trip last week.  I thought it might have just knocked the axle out of alignment but after looking at it today the axle is bent.   Blew a tire just north of Parry Sound on the drive home and pretty much destroyed the other one due to the alignment being way out of wack (toe)   So now the question is, new axle or get the current one straightened?    I don't even wanna know what ShoreLand'r is going to charge us for a new one    Of course the hubs and everything else are welded in, so no salvaging those either!  If anyone can recommend someone in the Barrie area I'd appreciate it."
799484,DRIFTER_016,2013-07-22 16:24:00,10439,"Bill You should be able to get one at places other than Shorelander. Need to know the weight rating and length as well as the distance between spring perches.  2000# axles: http://www.princessauto.com/pal/en/2000-Lb-Axles/1100-310-005-005-005.c  3500# axles: http://www.princessauto.com/pal/en/3500-Lb-Axles/1100-310-005-005-010.c  And these guys are located in Milton: http://www.cerka.ca/axles.asp  The axle replacement is easy. Jack up the trailer, put stands under the frame, undo the Ubolts holding the axle to the spring and lower the axle. Revers this procedure with the new one."
799486,BillM,2013-07-22 16:32:00,17367,"Thanks Dave, I'm assuming ShoreLandr uses a standard drop axle for their trailers that I should be able to pick up anywhere.  Oldman has already pulled the axle from the trailer, I'm going to take a run up there tonight and check it out for myself.  I'll probably bring it back with me tonight and drop it off at a local shop to see if it can be straightened.  If it can and I can get it aligned properly, I'll be happy.  If not, I'll replace it."
799500,SlowPoke,2013-07-22 17:44:00,2984,"Define ""bent"". Some axles have camber arc built into them.  This axle is normal... "
799502,BillM,2013-07-22 17:54:00,17367,"This axle doesn't have built in camber on either side.  It's a standard drop axle, which is now out over an inch in the middle, lol  I've got an appointment at Barrie Frame and Alignment on Wed, we'll see what they say."
799503,Sinker,2013-07-22 17:54:00,8692,"Try and find an axle with EZ lube hubs. Greatest thing ever, google it. I put one on my trailer a couple years ago.  I got mine from eastons, on hwy 115 northbound, just north of newcastle for a really good price. They will build to suit as well. Worth a call for sure!  S."
799504,BillM,2013-07-22 17:55:00,17367,Thanks for the info Shane!  I'll give them a ring as well.
799505,Sinker,2013-07-22 17:57:00,8692,The EZ lube hubs are worth it alone. Think I paid right around $200 for my 2000lb axle with hubs and bearings all set to go.
799506,Sinker,2013-07-22 18:00:00,8692,Try here.....  http://www.cerka.ca/catalog/EZLUBE.asp
799509,BillM,2013-07-22 18:11:00,17367," Wow that's a pretty good price.  I'll see what the alignment place has to say, if it's more to get it fixed I'll just replace the entire thing.  Those EZ-Lube hubs sound great."
799513,fishnsled,2013-07-22 18:45:00,3520,"If it was my choice I'd just go with a new axle, good piece of mind when driving down the highway.  I'm certainly no expert when it come to this but does the metal get weak (stressed) where the bend has happened? If bent back, would area be as good as new or are there some flaws?  Just curious."
799514,BillM,2013-07-22 18:48:00,17367,"I haven't the slightest idea, this is why I'll let the pros deal with it.   If they say the axle is toast, then I'll replace it."
799515,Sinker,2013-07-22 18:51:00,8692,"I tried to straighten my bent axle, and it did work....for a while.....until I hit another pot hole. Then it pretty near snapped right off, and the opposite tire was so out that it blew not far down the rd.  Replace it. Even if just for piece of mind.  How heavy of an axle is it? Square, or round? That will make a difference too.  S."
799516,BillM,2013-07-22 18:57:00,17367,"Square axle, 2000# if I'm not mistaken."
799517,DRIFTER_016,2013-07-22 19:00:00,10439,"Yeah, Bill Definitely go with the easy lube hubs if you are going to replace it."
