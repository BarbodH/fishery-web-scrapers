My in-laws watch my son and daughter so I thought I would give them a break for a couple days this week, my daughter is in camp this week but off for a week later this summer while my son is still in another camp ( have o figure out something to do with her for a couple days, maybe the beach and a mani/pedi day for her). Well we went to Port Maitland in the morning but not much biting other than Gobies ( the seagulls were well fed). We left and spent a couple hours at the Binbrook Conservation Area and this is what he hit on his last cast of the day with just a worm and hook.    I don't know who enjoyed the one on one time more, him or me? Was very hot out though and had to call it early."
