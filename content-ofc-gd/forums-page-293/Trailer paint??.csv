I just finished doing some welding & repairs on my boat trailer, next job is to paint it.  Can u recomend a good quality paint?  I've tried tremclad & armour coat but the rust eventually reappears in a short period of time.  Approx a year ago there was a report on this board of a high quality 2 part epoxy paint available at a dealer in Hamilton.  The guy stated it was rather expensive but lasted a very long time.  A fellow worker reported another product.  It's a spray can type of plastic paint available at Home Hardware.  If you want to change colours apparently you can cut it with a knife & peel it off like a banana skin??  Anybody here use this product?  Thanx for recomendations."

798850,DRIFTER_016,2013-07-18 22:20:00,10439,I would just have it done with spray on truck bedliner. That's what I'll be doing to mine when I redo it. Regular paint of any kind just doesn't hold up.  You may want to contact local shops that do spray in bedliners and see how much they charge.  If too much I would get some of this and do it myself. I will be going this route because there are no local places here to get it done.  http://www.duplicolor.com/products/bedArmor/  Comes in spray and roll on versions  http://www.duplicolor.com/products/truckBedCoating/  The only problem is it's black. To get coloured bedliner you would need to see one of the local shops.  Line-X does colour bedliner.  http://www.line-x.ca/index.php?page=home
798862,lew,2013-07-18 23:03:00,12766,"I called Line-X about doing my last trailer and they couldn't give an exact quote without seeing it, but said it'd be somewhere in the $700 range."
798877,Ainsley,2013-07-19 00:36:00,142,I'm not sure about sourcing it but I used marine paint on my trailer.  We use it to paint structural steel where I work. It is an amercoat product (5154 rings a bell but don't quote me on it) We get it in pails from PPG.
798893,Twocoda,2013-07-19 02:08:00,4130,2 part epoxy primer PPG DP40 has a rust inhibitor in it...then top coat with anything...acrylic enamel....
798895,boombap,2013-07-19 02:13:00,310,"A 2 part epoxy paint will do the job, maybe the best job if the prep is done correctly.  Noahs boats sells a few kinds.  A cheaper solution as stated above is to use bed liner.  Edit: If you can afford it, line-x is hands down the best thing to do if you plan on keeping the trailer for a few years. My old man had it done to his bed on his gmc canyon, that stuff is tough as nails and looks great."
798896,vance,2013-07-19 02:24:00,719,I was told by the line x dealer in oshawa that bed liners are porous and will let the water thru and if that is the case I can see the metal rusting under it.I was going to use it to seal my leaky old boat but I didn't want to waste my money.  vance
798918,wormdunker,2013-07-19 08:01:00,1711,Thanx for the replies.  I do like the looks of the truck bed liner (Line X)
798929,Roy,2013-07-19 11:24:00,13728,"While it's nice to have a clean, new looking trailer, I would be concerned about coating a trailer with some of the products on the market today. While I have no scientific evidence on this stuff, it occurred to me that if the product is flexible and doesn't crack, you'd never be able to detect a stress crack until it was too late. I regularly check the trailer for bolt tightness, cracks etc...and it would probably worry me more than anything else if I couldn't see the actual condition of the metal. What do you think?"
798953,outllaw,2013-07-19 13:54:00,1232,tremclad and a roller. cheap but very tuff. the oilbased. not water based.
798961,Ainsley,2013-07-19 14:22:00,142,I did primer and tremclad on mine two years ago and the rust is starting to poke through in a few spots.
799026,farsider,2013-07-19 20:05:00,456,"If you want to keep the trailer for a few years, use POR15 on all the rusted areas, then topcoat the rest with something less expensive.  Auto restoration guys swear by it.  http://www.canada-por15.com/index.htm  Cheers, Mark"
799151,wormdunker,2013-07-20 08:34:00,1711,farsider Thanx for your suggestion.  I just read their info.  Sounds like a good product.  Bonus - a retailer is only 30 minutes from my home!
