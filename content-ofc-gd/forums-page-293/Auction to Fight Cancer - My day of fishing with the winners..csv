I had offered up a day of Salmon fishing to help raise some some money for the Fish-A-Thon For A Cure through the Auction to fight Cancer.  The winning bidder was Cassandraï»¿ who was happy to give this as a birthday gift to her husband Fred.  The ""8 hour day"" was split up into and evening fish and morning fish the next day and turned into more like 11 hours.  It's tough to stop fishing when they are biting.    We boated 15 fish I believe and lost a bunch more.  A nice mixed bag of rainbows, chinnies, and the highlight for me,  an Atlantic!   Here's a few shots of our adventure.        Nice fish.     Fighting a fish and watching the sunset.    Another nice one.    End of the day.    The next morning and setting the bar high.    A very nice surprise and a first in my boat.    Ending the day with a double header of smaller bows.     Just a great couple of days for a great cause.  Be sure to check out the Fish-A-Thon post that is pinned and make a donation or get some sponsors and fish it!!"

798738,fishnsled,2013-07-18 15:23:00,3520,I think you might be better to book a charter with Lloyd.

798839,misfish,2013-07-18 21:28:00,29133," Terry and myself have the same problem out on Simcoe. Their just clicking away with their cameras. I have to slap Terry upside the head,when he poses. Trying to take all the credit. LMAO  Nice report Will.."
798974,fishnsled,2013-07-19 15:27:00,3520,"Thanks Ron and Brian.   I can just picture Terry pulling up the leg of his shorts to show off a bit more leg, tossing his head back.....  Although I'd rather not see that in person, I feel for your embarrassment Brian.  LOL!!"

799012,discophish,2013-07-19 19:18:00,392,"Umm ... on second thought, I think I will just read the reports when they become available.  Not sure what you guys get up to out there, but it sure sounds like there is way more to it than I am comfortable with!  My camera just accidentally flushed down the toilet."
