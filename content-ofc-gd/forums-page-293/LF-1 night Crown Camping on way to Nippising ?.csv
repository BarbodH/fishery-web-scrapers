798905,Tim Mills,2013-07-19 02:51:00,476,A buddy invited me up for a couple of days fishing at Bear Creek Cottages on Lake Nippising Sun afternoon-Tuesday morning.  I am planning to leave Sat at 2:00 pm and camping/fishing for 1 night along the way.  I'm taking a small jon boat with a 6hp.  I thought maybe Crane/Blackstone or trying to access something by boat from Britt or Key River?  Is there a place on the way to Nippising you would recommend to crown land camp/fish for 1 night?  Thanks in advance for any advice/suggestions.  Tim
