796670,misfish,2013-07-05 18:28:00,29133,"Wheres muskymatt PRAISE ELFIE  The biggest story of the day however might be Daniel Alfredsson who is leaving the Ottawa Senators after 17 seasons in the nation's capital. According to TSN Hockey Insider Darren Dreger, the long-time Ottawa captain made the Senators aware of his decision on Thursday night and will sign a one-year, $5.5 million contract with the Detroit Red Wings. Last season, Alfredsson scored 10 goals and 16 assists in 47 games. He also added 4 goals and 10 points in 10 playoff games. The native of Gothenburg, Sweden has spent his entire career with Ottawa, scoring 426 goals and adding 682 assists in 1,178 games. The 40-year-old veteran was originally selected in the sixth round by the Senators at the 1994 NHL Entry Draft.  This is ensane   The Red Wings also landed former Florida Panther centre Stephen Weisswith a five-year, $24.5 million contract.  Weiss, the 4th overall pick in the 2001 draft, played in just 17 games for the Panthers last season due to a wrist injury but had scored at least 20 goals in each of the three previous seasons. Heading to Ottawa meanwhile, is left-winger Clarke MacArthur who signed a two-year $6.5 million dollar deal with the Senators. MacArthur, who was originally drafted 73rd overall by Buffalo in 2003, scored eight goals and 20 points for the Maple Leafs last season."

796692,Jigger,2013-07-05 21:01:00,1237,"So let me get this straight... The Leafs sign Bozak, who has only broken 40pts once and has never potted 20goals, and Clarkson, who makes Komisarek look like an Olympic speed skater and averages 29 pts per season to contracts in excess of 4 mil each? In the process lost Clarke MacArthur who signed for 2, not 7, years at a little over 3mil per? Its official, I threw up all over myself."

How many times last year did we see the camera show Garbo's eyes looking like fry pans on the bench? I also have a suspect that (and I have no evidence to support this) he may have been a poor influence on some of the teamates. Again, just a feeling I have! HH"

796622,kickingfrog,2013-07-05 16:17:00,8333,A 40 year old who produces 50 points maybe this year. Easy for the sens to replace. Difficult for fanboy to replace.

796643,Jigger,2013-07-05 17:01:00,1237,Glad Komisarek got a deal so quickly.
796644,fishsevern,2013-07-05 17:03:00,112," Was thinking the same thing....don't they understand yet?  Horton especially with all his injuries and getting a 7 year contract, risky business."

796505,Jigger,2013-07-04 22:41:00,1237,"Since joining the team in 08-09, has 208pts. Second only to Kessel in that period 253pts. Widely regarded as an upper-tier 2C, has the heart of a lion. Leafs in 29th as far as cap space goes with no awesome free agents out there to throw money at.... Stupid move. Watch them sign Weiss to a hulking contract. Or worse, give the same contract to Bozak. Wouldnt be surprised if Grabbo signs on with the Hawks before sunrise and has a banner year."
796506,kickingfrog,2013-07-04 22:54:00,8333,The talk is the coach doesn't want Grabo.
796511,Jigger,2013-07-04 23:13:00,1237,Undertsandable since he didnt know how to use him last year. No surprise that it would've been his worst point total since joining the Leafs. Coaches can either bring out the best or the worst in players. Thought Grabbo would have redeemed himself in Carlyles eyes after his play against Boston in the playoffs. Still in disbeleaf.
796512,BillM,2013-07-04 23:15:00,17367,"Man, I don't like that Grabo buy out.. He's a the best corner person they've got..  Not a lot of points (this year at least) but his play in the playoffs like Jigger mentioned was great.  Stupid stupid stupid!"
796513,Dan668,2013-07-04 23:24:00,1120,"Ton of giveaways, always knocked on the ground, Couldnt buy a goal in the playoffs, -10, ill pass. Not consistent, potential health condition? Also carlyle doesnt like/play him. So keep a guy for 5m to warm the bench?"
796517,BillM,2013-07-04 23:31:00,17367, Post up his last full season stats and see if you still don't want him on your team.
796522,kickingfrog,2013-07-04 23:43:00,8333,"Grabo was overpaid by a million or so but he was a solid forward and not all of what he contributed can be measured easily with traditional stats. I'm certainly not heart broken by the buyout, but on the other hand I'll judge it based on who, and for how much, they get this summer."
796523,Jigger,2013-07-04 23:48:00,1237,"Carlyle misplayed Lupul out of town in Ana as well. Looking at it from that point of view tells that neither of them (Lupul in Ana and Grabs now) were very good defensively. Still fuming over the buyout and dont think Weiss, who is only a marginal upgrade at this point for a guy picked 4th overall, is the answer. Neither is Bozak. I really think Carlyle made a poor decision here, but am really appreciating the fact that Nonis is holding everybody accountable. Gonna miss 94. Loved watching him buzzsaw all over the place. Some lucky team is going to get a very motivated player at a very reasonable price.  Have to add, search out Jonas Siegels twitter. Grabs parting words on Carlyle made me laugh"
796524,Dan668,2013-07-04 23:48:00,1120,"Previous stats don't mean anything. A 5m player should be consistent. It's obvious Carlyle doesn't like him, so what's the point in keeping an overpaid player who won't preform to his abilities. I'm sure another team will pick him up for less quickly"
796525,Jigger,2013-07-04 23:56:00,1237,Heres the Siegel piece. Wasnt twitter...  http://www.tsn.ca/toronto/blogs/jonas_siegel/?id=426967
796526,BillM,2013-07-05 00:07:00,17367,I hope Nonis isn't trying to build this team up with FA's...
796539,jedimaster,2013-07-05 00:59:00,3472,What fa's? There isn't a whole lot out there. Certainly not a big center like we need. We missed one already.
796540,BillM,2013-07-05 01:08:00,17367," Well yeah, that's my point, lol."
796541,jedimaster,2013-07-05 01:10:00,3472,honestly as far as grab goes I can see both sides. He was a good heart player. The problems lie with his lack of Defense and awful face off percentage. If the coach has a vision of x and o and you are playing Y expect to sit or get shipped out. He didn't fit the team mold the coach is trying to build. Plain and simple. Its that he was bad at times he was the best on the ice. Just didn't fit.
796548,kickingfrog,2013-07-05 02:08:00,8333,Oh oh. Could be a bad day in the capital come morning.
796564,danc,2013-07-05 02:53:00,4677,"Nothing to add to the thread, but I ran into Eric Staal at gas station today. Was kinda cool."
796591,jbailey,2013-07-05 12:43:00,866,"Ouch, someone's a little defensive.."
796595,Jigger,2013-07-05 13:21:00,1237,"Of all the possible guys that the Leafs could get today, the only guy that interests me a little is Horton. Even then hes injury prone and might not have the wheels to keep up. No to Clarkson or Weiss. Nonis left alot of cap room but is going to end up with alot of poor contracts 3yrs down the road if hes not careful. Hopefully he finds something on the trade market."
796600,kickingfrog,2013-07-05 13:59:00,8333,Talk is clarkson might get 7 years at 6 million per. That's nuts. Tell me again how its the player's fault.
796602,Headhunter,2013-07-05 14:09:00,5703,"Garbo is a walking example a concusion. Does anyone really think that he could continue to take/absorb the kind of punishment he was taking and continue to be an effective player? How many nights did we all sit around the TV watching him getting slammed? Would you invest $20 mill in a player who many times, didn't know his own name at the end of the game? IMHO, getting rid of Garbo was a shrewd move. HH"
796604,Raf,2013-07-05 14:48:00,3495,grabovski is a winger forced to play center due to the lack of depth the leafs have at that position.  his faceoff % was poor and he played out of position.  i think buying him out was a good move since we are ok on the wings.  problem is there is nobody worthwhile available at that coveted center position.
796605,BillM,2013-07-05 14:49:00,17367, How many games did Grabo miss because of concussions?   Find me a player for the Leafs that worked harder in the corners then he did during the Boston series.  I'm willing to bet you can't.
796609,tb4me,2013-07-05 15:22:00,3295,Praise Alfie  ...The Sens suck so bad even he is now leaving.   Told the team last night he wont be back...Looks like Detroit are in the mix for his one year of service....
796610,BillM,2013-07-05 15:26:00,17367,"So the Leafs have 24M left and still need to sign Kadri, Franson, Gunnarsson, Bernier and Fraser.   I wonder how much they'll have left after they've signed... 12 M or so?"
796163,Jigger,2013-07-03 00:02:00,1237,Puh-leeze. Kessel could pot 30 with McClaren as his C.
796165,BillM,2013-07-03 00:13:00,17367, Did a teenage girl hijack your account?  So dramatic.
796167,kickingfrog,2013-07-03 00:21:00,8333,They might have Briere signed in a little bit. And he would fit in perfectly.
796168,kickingfrog,2013-07-03 00:23:00,8333, And Bozak shows up at both ends of the rink and wins faceoffs even when he's not producing points.
796169,manitoubass2,2013-07-03 00:24:00,11391,IMO leafs should def try to sign bozack for 5. A big name would be nice too but im not convinced its needed. Last year was a great year and showed a ton of promise. If the leafs need to improve anywhere my focus would be the defense
796170,Broker,2013-07-03 00:35:00,482,That would be HUGE for the habs in my opinion!

Guess we'll see in a few years.  http://ca.sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nhl-puck-daddy/martin-brodeur-announces-son-selection-nj-devils-classic-023742760.html
795953,kickingfrog,2013-07-01 21:00:00,8333,"Oh ya, and Tim Thomas is looking to play somewhere this coming season. What do the Islanders do?"
795962,BillM,2013-07-01 22:56:00,17367,"Tim Thomas, lol."
795963,Sebastian,2013-07-01 23:25:00,208,I'm curious how Luongo will like playing for a team that was trying to get rid of him and solely blame him for the 2011 collapse to the Bruins. Unreal draft. Free agency will be even better! I think Lecalvier will be heading to Montreal.
795966,BillM,2013-07-02 00:18:00,17367," Yeah, I can't see Lou enjoying that scenario much.  As for Vinny,. Montreal seems like the place he'll end up."
795971,kickingfrog,2013-07-02 01:15:00,8333,Vinny is 6 inches too tall to play forward for them.
796024,lookinforwalleye,2013-07-02 13:19:00,4399,"Ya Rob not sure if there would be a stall that he will fit into!!! Not sure if he will end up in Montreal, not sure if he wants the attention."
796027,jedimaster,2013-07-02 14:06:00,3472,"Would be nice to see him in Toronto. I like bolland as a third line center, Vinny and kadri as 1 and 2 centers."
796028,jedimaster,2013-07-02 14:08:00,3472,Dipetro is bought out.
796053,kickingfrog,2013-07-02 16:22:00,8333,Ya I can see how the anonymity that a hockey player has in some/many US cities would be appealing.
796058,kickingfrog,2013-07-02 16:51:00,8333,Glendale votes tonight on coyotes future. Coming back to Canada soon?
796124,kickingfrog,2013-07-02 22:45:00,8333,Vinny to Philly.
796130,jedimaster,2013-07-02 23:06:00,3472,Yah heard the spill on the radio. It sure would be nice if the leafs could land one of these big guns.
796131,Jigger,2013-07-02 23:06:00,1237,"If they had a goalie it would make sense?  Edit to add: maybe one of Couturier or Schenn could be involved in a trade for a goalie or an upgrade on D? Otherwise, seems a little sideways to give a banged up VL a full NMC for the full five. Figured Holmgren wouldve learned his leason with Bryzgalov."
796137,BillM,2013-07-02 23:14:00,17367,Lets get Bozak signed and I'll feel a lot better.
796141,lookinforwalleye,2013-07-02 23:21:00,4399,"Does not surprise me in the least philly is a good place for him I am guessing the habs and other teams were smart enough not offer a 5 year deal, and please somebody tell me how Holmgren still has a job as a GM after the mess he has made of goaltending situation, Briere, Carter, Richards etc."
796145,Jigger,2013-07-02 23:33:00,1237,Not sure if serious...
796147,kickingfrog,2013-07-02 23:37:00,8333,Komo bought out.    No answer.  Bozak is a solid centre. My worry is the $ and term.
796148,Jigger,2013-07-02 23:41:00,1237,Not exactly sold on that. Especially if the term is 8yrs which is the latest as per tsn. Bozaks numbers are awful when Kessel is taken away.
796150,BillM,2013-07-02 23:42:00,17367," Go find them another center, lol."
796152,davey buoy,2013-07-02 23:43:00,5505,I'd like to see Bozak signed up as well. At least get that out of the way.
796153,kickingfrog,2013-07-02 23:43:00,8333,"I don't want anybody for 8 years. Chicken and egg, Kessel misses Bozak as well."
796154,BillM,2013-07-02 23:45:00,17367,Definitely not an 8yr contract..  5yr? Sign him up.
796161,Broker,2013-07-02 23:58:00,482,"The habs need to make a couple signings this Friday. They need some players to get them through the playoffs.. Prust was one heck of a player, hopefully they make more smart moves like him."
795692,kickingfrog,2013-06-30 14:12:00,8333,"Lots moves expected today. My big questions are: Are the Avalanche bluffing with the #1 pick? Does Bobbylou finaly move? Where does Vinny sign? And to a lesser extent, Who, if anybody, drafts Martin Brodeur's son."
795694,BillM,2013-06-30 14:17:00,17367,"Been waiting for the Draft day!   Should be interesting...  Interested to see where Vinny goes and if Roy has any say in the #1 pick like he thinks he does, lol."
795696,kickingfrog,2013-06-30 14:21:00,8333,"I think, or would hope, that the coach and GM are on the same page. Not good to play team poker with one guy bluffing and the other guy playing straight."
795697,BillM,2013-06-30 14:24:00,17367,Agreed 100%
795699,Sebastian,2013-06-30 14:37:00,208,"Reports are saying Schneider getting moved is more likely than Luongo. Vinny, Letang, Briere, Horton, Bryzgalov. There are some big names out there."
795708,kickingfrog,2013-06-30 15:44:00,8333,And some of them can even play.
795711,Sebastian,2013-06-30 15:55:00,208,Letang resigned with the Pens
795713,davey buoy,2013-06-30 16:02:00,5505,The rumour I  heard last week about being traded to leafs.The leafs wanted to give up to much imo. Good for Chris!
795748,kickingfrog,2013-06-30 20:04:00,8333,Holly       !!!!! Guess who's going to NJ. Did not see that coming.
795749,BillM,2013-06-30 20:06:00,17367,"NJ definitely got the good end of that deal, Vancouver should have asked for more."
795751,kickingfrog,2013-06-30 20:12:00,8333,They were offered more for Bobbylou last summer and overplayed their hand.
795753,BillM,2013-06-30 20:20:00,17367," Would you want Schnieder traded to another team in your conference?   I wouldn't, lol."
795754,misfish,2013-06-30 20:26:00,29133,"Look how happy papa is. Papa hand hands of stone,kid has hands to score. GO FIGURE."
795757,kickingfrog,2013-06-30 20:30:00,8333,"Luongo could have been moved last summer for more. The Canucks would not have been tied to that long contract, they would still have ""their goalie of the future"" and they would have had more talent and more NHL ready talent. The Canucks overplayed their hand and all they have to show for it is a #9 pick and an contract that that goes for 9 more years, or 18 if they buy him out."
795766,BillM,2013-06-30 21:02:00,17367,Having Lou as your #1 goalie isn't a bad thing is it?
795770,kickingfrog,2013-06-30 21:09:00,8333,"He's 34. He's under contract for 9 more years (50 plus million dollars). For over a year his GM, coach and many fans have not wanted him. I think he checked out at the end of the season, if not sooner. Luongo is a solid goalie, his cap hit isn't bad, but the term is awful."
795774,misfish,2013-06-30 21:38:00,29133,Apparently his is pissed about the trade. I think Vancouver is sticking it to him. TAKE THAT.
795775,BillM,2013-06-30 21:44:00,17367,"He's got 50mil coming to him over the life of his contract, what's to be pissed about?   If he wanted to be the #1 in Van, he got his wish."
795776,misfish,2013-06-30 21:54:00,29133,"IMO He may be number one now. I feel for the fans,and the team players."
795783,kickingfrog,2013-06-30 22:31:00,8333,He is not responsible for this situation. The Vancouver management and ownership bear the burden. They signed him to the deal and then signed Schneider without a plan.
795784,misfish,2013-06-30 22:34:00,29133,"No matter, Schneider is the big winner here. I,ll bet he,s happy."
795786,BillM,2013-06-30 22:41:00,17367,Bolland to TO!!!!!!!
795787,kickingfrog,2013-06-30 22:44:00,8333,"Ya, replacing one of the best goalies ever will be a breeze. At least no one will be in the arena to watch… if they stay in Jersey."
795788,kickingfrog,2013-06-30 22:47:00,8333,And they only gave up guys named Who.
795791,BillM,2013-06-30 22:49:00,17367,"I really hope they don't do something stupid with Bozak, because Bolland can't replace him, lol."
