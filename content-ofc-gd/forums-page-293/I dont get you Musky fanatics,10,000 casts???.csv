798301,Rich Clemens,2013-07-15 22:11:00,3131,"I think the 10,000 casts is for the larger ones     (yes - I'm still casting for the 50 and I would think I am well over that 10,000 mark.   At least, near the end of a single week, it sure feels like it.  None the less - congrats.  I lovbe to catch them - no matter the size."
798306,Pigeontroller,2013-07-15 22:32:00,2793," By better people right?  I felt disrespected, what can I say...A simple 'no' would have sufficed, I didn't  need the sarcasm guy..."
798307,Pigeontroller,2013-07-15 22:35:00,2793," Hey Pike-whacker, sorry I disappointed you again, lol....Ironically, I'm much less of a 'out-spoken' type than a much loved OFCer ex president of Muskies Canada...And to answer your second question, not me."
798308,aplumma,2013-07-15 22:37:00,6896,"Yea you should see what Lew did to me when he took me musky fishing. He tied a cinderblock with 2 hooks on it and told be to just keep casting it to his ""special holes"". After about 30 minutes I told him I didn't want to ever catch a muskie and he said under his breath ""Mission Accomplished"".  Thanks Lew......   Art"
798311,Rich,2013-07-15 22:46:00,3927,Lol .. great report and thread.
798313,misfish,2013-07-15 22:49:00,29133,"There was no disrespect intended. I was wondering why you asked when I noted,a a different lake. When you asked if it was Simcoe,I knew,you didnt read the report. Never take for granted I guess. Maybe I should of posted,,,,,,,,,,,  Happy fishing to you Dax."
798315,Terry,2013-07-15 22:52:00,14456,I just want to fish......
798317,misfish,2013-07-15 22:54:00,29133,"Shut up.who,s talking to you anyways."

798360,Freshtrax,2013-07-16 04:25:00,2215,How did it taste? I heard Muskie tastes like lobster
798520,mistyriver1,2013-07-17 01:50:00,600,NIce report Brian.  Good to see you and Terry getting out...    I see some folks haven't changed...
798763,Bassassins,2013-07-18 18:25:00,111,That post made for an entertaining lunch hour ... Great report! Comical thread!
797960,misfish,2013-07-13 22:24:00,29133,"East wind was blowing when we arrived,the chop was about 1ft. Not knowing this lake very well,having only fished it twice for bass,I was thankful to have a great guide. Ali Bolly. Man this guy had marks all over the lake where he caught fish. To me this was MONEY.  Lots of tap tap taps on the harnesses,,but nothing to show.  We move to another spot. No tap tap taps. Ok,this is where the big fish live. After about 20 minutes of the harness,I switch up to a vibrax.Bolly puts on a body bait.  Start our troll. Oh my,I get a solid hit. Dinner????? Nope,in the slot limit,16.25. No pickeral bacon wraps.     Give the vibrax another go for a bit,nothing,so reworm the rig and out it goes. 30 ft behind the boat. Sitting there chatting away,and wham,no tic tic,just a wham bam. Fights on. Oh it,s a big pickeral. As it gets closer to the boat,I see a green streak go by. Oh my,it,s a musky. Ali says no,it,s a pike. I say (cant say what I said here. It,s a Musky. YAHOOOOOOOOOOO  After a short battle,it was landed.      You musky guys are doing it all wrong..   RIBBING,just in case you dont know me.  Ok truth be told,Ali and i were pickeral fishing,but this little guy(only my third ever,first two were with long time member Garry 2r,s) smacked my worm harness. It was a great battle. I could feel the braid ripping through the weeds,had to pull him out a few times.  Heading in,we hit our first spot that had lots of tap tap taps. Ali showed that you always go back to where you start.It was one that could of been taken,but we decided not,and left him to live another day.    All fish released to play with another angler another day. The cast Misfish,played by misfish  Ali Bolly,played by Terry.      Terry is nominated for outstanding Bolly giude service.  A fun day to report      "
797961,Terry,2013-07-13 22:32:00,14456,well we're half way there......lol  I don't know where that east wind came from  most likely the east  it was a good day on the water
797962,misfish,2013-07-13 22:35:00,29133,well we're half way there......lol  Still LMAO about that one. and on the half way back. HAHA
797987,dhickey,2013-07-14 00:27:00,1038,Well then. How many cast would you be willing to make or how much time would you be willing to troll?  The average musky fisherman  spend on average 75 hrs looking for something to talk about.
797990,misfish,2013-07-14 00:38:00,29133,"  Hence my point,which you failed to see,,,,,,,,LMAO  RIBBING,just in case you dont know me."
797999,Pigeontroller,2013-07-14 01:21:00,2793,Simcoe?
798003,misfish,2013-07-14 01:31:00,29133,"  Ya,thats it."

798014,Joey,2013-07-14 02:52:00,9122,"Awww, what a cute little fishy you caught there B  Nice hat Ali"
798031,mike rousseau,2013-07-14 11:07:00,4661,"Yeah... There always easy to catch until your trying for em.,. Lol....  Looks like a fun day... And looks like terry's boat was a great investment... Lots of good stories so far..."
798039,Pigeontroller,2013-07-14 12:51:00,2793,I didn't ask so I could race up there and target them Illegally bozo...Maybe because you regularly post Simcoe reports and if that had been Simcoe that very well could've been a stocked fish from 2012!    Thanks for the answer though...
798042,lew,2013-07-14 13:08:00,12766," Is this what he's calling his musky Joey ???  jeeeez, I thought that was his bait  "
798044,Terry,2013-07-14 13:12:00,14456,I knew why you asked
798078,misfish,2013-07-14 15:36:00,29133, Now thats funny.
798081,Pigeontroller,2013-07-14 15:51:00,2793,"Yup, I called you a CLOWN."
798082,misfish,2013-07-14 15:54:00,29133,"Been called worse Dax. Like water on a ducks back.   I can see though,you didnt read the report.If you did,your question wouldnt of been asked.   East wind was blowing when we arrived,the chop was about 1ft. Not knowing this lake very well,having only fished it twice for bass,I was thankful to have a great guide."
798084,Roy,2013-07-14 16:06:00,13728,That picture was taken yesterday. I'll bet that fish is much bigger by now.
798090,Tim Mills,2013-07-14 16:18:00,476,Enjoyied the report and the banter
798091,misfish,2013-07-14 16:25:00,29133,"Thanks guys. I just thought a fun report would make some laugh.  Lew,I know you throw bigger baits then that one I caught.LOL   LMAO Roy."

798104,misfish,2013-07-14 17:35:00,29133," LOL I know. Need to get over yer way and do a fish together. Back of the boat is still open for bass guys?   Terry,thats too funny. Im glad I didnt get raked for a bad hold. I was very gentle with it."
798105,Roy,2013-07-14 17:39:00,13728,"BTW, that's a very bad hold.   Are you happy now?"
