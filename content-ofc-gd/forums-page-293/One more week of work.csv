798217,Roy,2013-07-15 10:22:00,13728,"Then I'm off for 3 weeks. I don't have a lot planned but my first stop this year will be Lakair. I'm really looking forward to seeing some friends up there. Fishing, relaxing, catching up with friends works for me. Anyone in the area next week please feel free to drop by and say hello."
798218,lew,2013-07-15 10:45:00,12766,Have a blast up there Roy and all I ask is that you leave a couple slimers for me for August.
798219,Roy,2013-07-15 10:48:00,13728,HA! Thanks Lew. I hadn't planned on bringing very many muskies back for the freezer.
798223,aplumma,2013-07-15 11:20:00,6896,Well you know how afraid the muskies are of me Lew. I will be drowning a few lures and will try to ruin Rich's record like I did yours Lew.    Art
798232,Rich Clemens,2013-07-15 12:56:00,3131,Alright ...  I'll stop by and say hello on the way to my boat - just have the coffee on will ya 
798233,Rich Clemens,2013-07-15 12:58:00,3131,Me thinks I'll have a couple day's head start on ya - but I guess it really only takes that one cast.     Looking forward to seeing everyone after a couple years now.  Ya'll have a safe trip. 
798368,Roy,2013-07-16 11:01:00,13728,Was talking to Leslie this morning and she says that there are no fire bans in effect but one may be coming as it is very dry.
798393,fishsevern,2013-07-16 13:56:00,112,"Hope you get your fire because the evenings just aren't the same without.  Last year's ban in the Muskoka's was brutal.  This past Saturday I had a campfire with Honeymoon Suite playing a concert 2 minutes away from us. Cooking dogs, drinking beer, and the Suite playing = Good times!"
798503,solopaddler,2013-07-17 00:50:00,8605,"3 weeks off? Good for you Roy, enjoy yourself!"

798686,Rich Clemens,2013-07-18 09:22:00,3131,Randy:  I'll be pulling in sometime mid/late afternoon this Saturday - staying until the following Saturday. I believe Art and Joe will be arriving sometime on Tuesday.
798696,Roy,2013-07-18 11:24:00,13728,Sunday is the best travel day from here but I probably  won't leave until Monday morning. It'll depend on how much I can get done between now and Saturday night.
798701,Rich Clemens,2013-07-18 11:55:00,3131,"What I saw on Wolseley's Facebook page, it sounds like they must have a fire ban in place down there.   Not sure if it right now - or a little earlier in the year.  Hope we'll be able to have a few evening camp-fires and some truthful story tellin' "
798716,Moosebunk,2013-07-18 14:08:00,3970,"Three weeks Roy!!!  Man, hope the heat fizzles down to about 24C for ya, little mix of sun and cloud, full moon for 3 weeks,  and hooks setting into anything with gills every minute."
