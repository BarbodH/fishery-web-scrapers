798831,Walleye72,2013-07-18 21:16:00,156,"I recently purchased a Tracker boat on a Shorelander trailer. I recently read about needing the correct 4-way or wrench to remove the tire in case of a blowout. In preparation for an upcoming trip, I walked out to my trailer to investigate and found the lug bolts blocked by a cover of some kind.  Is that simply more decorative hubcap or something with a purpose? And how do I get that cover off. I pulled on it and twisted it and it didn't seem like it wanted to come off.  This is probably a very noob post to have to make, but this is all new to me.  Thank you very much.  Bill  "

On the inside of the cap - each of those prongs fits around the lug nut underneath it.. Loosen up and pull it off straight back towards you. Fit back in place and give her a tap to get her back on there good
