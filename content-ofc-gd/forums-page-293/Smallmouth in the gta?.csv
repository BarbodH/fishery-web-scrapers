799377,Rich,2013-07-21 19:32:00,3927,"There's that big lake on the south side. Ontario, I believe its called?"
799380,davey buoy,2013-07-21 19:43:00,5505,"Smallies like structure,lots of structure around Toronto shores. Good luck!!!!"
799382,ehg,2013-07-21 19:56:00,2666,You are best off to pick a large river/creek start at the mouth and walk upstream tossing small spinners into deeper obvious pools.
799443,Mistaflyboy34,2013-07-22 04:00:00,29,Ha that's pretty funny
799460,Rich,2013-07-22 12:35:00,3927,"Lol, sorry I stay away from GTA like its the plague, but if I lived there I'd be all over the harbourfront. I have walked the shore in hamilton harbour and connected with smallies, T.O should be no problem. I hear the mouths of creeks and rivers are good in the summer, makes sense if there is fresh inflow it will attract bait."
