What do you guys think the best way to catch the walleye in there would be? I can also boat there but i prefer to stay in the lake. Slip floats + minnows after dark, any suggestions? Thanks Matt."

I fish a bridge for pics and we just drop a hook, sinker, and minnow and just jig it.  Its basic ,nothing fancy, but we catch them that way.  If you cast out with the minnow, just twitch it in off bottom slowly.  Watch the line for the pick up, thats the key."

Thanks for the help, im going to try that spot tonight at dusk doing exactly what you said. Oh ya also i was fishing the mainlake today vertical jigging around an island got what i thought was the biggest walleye ever on, turned out to be a 5 lb channel cat lol"
798804,jimmer,2013-07-18 20:18:00,2730,That's the best technique for that type of fishing. Don't forget the bug juice!!!!!!! or you won't last long.
