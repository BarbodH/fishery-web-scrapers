799097,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2013-07-19 23:52:00,535,Impossible to tell exactly how big it is from pictures alone but it's a very big fish regardless.
799101,glen,2013-07-20 00:12:00,2641,"Look at Williamson's fish online.  The 53.5"" was to the fork not total length."
798620,TJQ,2013-07-17 22:19:00,7806,Ive been sick for the last few days so forgive me if someone else has already posted this...  http://www.fieldandstream.com/blogs/field-notes/2013/07/wisconsin-angler-releases-possible-world-record-muskie    
798621,Jigger,2013-07-17 22:25:00,1237,"Pre-spawn, 64""? Monster indeed! I was going to comment on the jacket, but it was caught in May, not today."
798625,lew,2013-07-17 22:32:00,12766,"Saw that on another website this morning TJ, a real brute for sure !!"
798626,captpierre,2013-07-17 22:34:00,2521,Heck of a fish.  Hopefully it survived
798632,Crazy Ivan,2013-07-17 23:29:00,184,Nice fish but 72 lbs? No way.  It looks bigger because he's reaching for the camera instead of holding it against his body.
798633,leaf4,2013-07-17 23:31:00,2466,"holy crap that thing is huge! on 17lb test none the less, what a catch"
798634,Rich Clemens,2013-07-17 23:47:00,3131,Now that would fill up anyone's pants.
798639,fishindevil,2013-07-18 00:10:00,6254,Yes I seen that fish on Facebook a week or so ago !!!! She is a big one !!!!! Wow....
798642,glen,2013-07-18 00:22:00,2641,"Thanks for putting it up TJ.  Nice one. My pants are 36"" so if they don't fit it's a bigun."
798643,fishsevern,2013-07-18 00:23:00,112,"All it takes is one bite at the right time, at the right place, with the right lure, with strong enough line, and a way to get them into the boat (or shore).  Easy for that guy."
798645,porkpie,2013-07-18 00:28:00,2521,"  Thats a big fish, and he isn't holding it that far away, you can tell by the angle of his right arm.  However it is not a 72LB fish, I agree.  Hell of a catch though!"
798648,glen,2013-07-18 00:39:00,2641,Hard to tell true size of any fish from a picture. I've had people think my 40s are bigger then my 50s.
798667,Joey,2013-07-18 02:37:00,9122,"What a monster.  I don't think he is holding it out toward the camera, his arms are bent.  That thing would weigh a ton and be too heavy to hold out.  Looks pretty dang heavy to me and if that guy weights say 200 lbs and that fish is half the guy's size it could definitely weigh 72 lbs.  The head of the fish even looks bigger than his head"
798682,mike rousseau,2013-07-18 07:17:00,4661,"Not to high jack but this was also boated recently... 57.25"" by Mike Hulbert   "
798698,Rich,2013-07-18 11:43:00,3927,"""The head of the fish looks as big as his head""  ""He is not holding it towards the camera at all""  Two statements that conflict a little. Lol  What a monster! I dunno about record class or anything like that, but it sure is a trophy musky.  Being able to tell how long or heavy from that pic/hold would be completely impossible."
798950,Crazy Ivan,2013-07-19 13:32:00,184,Here is a big fish photo that makes it easier to judge the size. This one was 65lbs. Scroll up and compare it to the Wisconsin muskie.  
798951,lew,2013-07-19 13:44:00,12766,"Ivan, that 65 pounder was disputed by many people too. I doubt there's ever been a big musky caught that wasn't disputed by someone and is the exact reason why many musky anglers never even bother posting pictures of their catches."
798952,outllaw,2013-07-19 13:51:00,1232,LEW yer dead on that one. more often then not guys don't show trophy catches...
798954,Moosebunk,2013-07-19 13:58:00,3970,"The minute you say ""trophy"" anything, whether it is or not, the eyes of some will just roll for different reasons.  You or someone mentions ""record"" breaking and that's even worse.  Heck, I've known people that will end friendships over such things.  Big ole ski this one is... to him it's both a trophy and his record I'm betting."
798955,Lunkerhunter,2013-07-19 14:10:00,455,solid fish for sure! and from shore!!!
798956,lew,2013-07-19 14:11:00,12766,"And more often than not, the guys doing all the name calling are guys who've never caught a big musky themselves...funny how that happens."
798978,captpierre,2013-07-19 15:51:00,2521,gotta love those wide angled lenses some guys use
799093,ehg,2013-07-19 23:37:00,2666,"It is a big, old fat musky. Nice surprising catch.  If you look at O'Briens 65 lb,. 58 by 30 inch fish or Williamson's 61 lb., 53.5 by 30 inch fish. they are way bigger than this supposed 64 inch fish."
799094,Jigger,2013-07-19 23:45:00,1237,"I dont know the length or girth of O'Brian or Grover. Without that info, it is impossible to judge their fish against each other."
799096,TJQ,2013-07-19 23:47:00,7806,Trophy or Not... its an awesome fish.
