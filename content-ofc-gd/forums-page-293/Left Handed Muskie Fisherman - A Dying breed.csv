798926,Rich,2013-07-19 10:33:00,3927,How accurate can you toss a lure with your left arm?  That's the point of switching hands. Not ease of turning the crank.
798940,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2013-07-19 12:33:00,535,I've got a revo toro high speed in left hand retrieve. I don't know why they discontinued it.
798942,Believer,2013-07-19 12:42:00,40,I have the Daiwa Luna for casting and Okuma Coldwarter for trolling both in left. They're doing pretty good so far this year. The luna pulls in double 10's no problem.
798945,Lunkerhunter,2013-07-19 13:04:00,455,its good to see im not the only one but what a pain in the ass. I was hoping to get a low profile reel and I didnt want to end up with a round reel in the lower end of the market.  I can sort of reel both ways but as many of you i hate switching hands when casting and have much more power holding the rod with my right hand. i would much prefer to use my left to reel with.  I have several set ups for different baits/styles of fishing. the reason i wanted a reel to pick up the line quickly was for a single application. just like bass guys who have different combo's for each application of fishing.  If anyone who is a lefty wants a reel for twin 10's and big baits the toro winch is the ticket! and they still make them in left hand retrieve for now anyway.  i will definetely be picking up a 400 lexa when they come out in Canada and check out the Avet reels as mentioned above. i would LOVE to see the tranx or similar in a left hand model but im probably dreaming.
798959,BucktownAngler,2013-07-19 14:18:00,582," i was looking into them, and after talking to some guys i was talked out of it. apparently the retrieve is too slow. how do you like it?"
798960,lew,2013-07-19 14:21:00,12766,"If some of you guys would just learn how to fish properly and crank with your right hand the way your sposed to, you'd save all this hassle of looking for hard to find reels."
798964,Lunkerhunter,2013-07-19 14:31:00,455,"i have a winch paired with a sling blade and use it pretty much strictly for twin 10's etc. i find it to be very easy to bring in the big stuff and i can still burn the bait under the surface with ease.  that being said i only use it for that and not much else so if you wanted it for more than that the NaCl or calcutta may be a more rounded out reel for your needs.  and lew, hahah! easier said than done"
798969,JoshS,2013-07-19 14:53:00,729,"It's not high speed but the new Calcutta D comes in lefty and it's a pretty nice reel that's versatile enough for all round use. I don't think you want to use the Curado's for jerkbaits, doesn't seem strong enough with all the hard jerks it'll take. My Curado EJ is still holding up after some abuse but feels like it's not going to last forever and I still only like it for lighter baits."
798984,OhioFisherman,2013-07-19 16:10:00,6623,http://www.ebay.com/itm/New-Shimano-Corvalus-CVL401-Fishing-Baitcasting-Reel-/190820520876   http://www.ebay.com/itm/Shimano-Cardiff-Baitcasting-Reel-CDF401A-LH-/200632999452   http://www.ebay.com/itm/SHIMANO-Calcutta-CT401D-Left-Hand-/310529192941   http://www.ebay.com/itm/NEW-Shimano-Calcutta-Conquest-401-Left-Handle-Spinning-Fishing-Reel-SVS-Japan-/271168769460
798759,Lunkerhunter,2013-07-18 18:02:00,455,"so apparently reel manufacturers have started to forget or ignore the fact that there are still musky fisherman who reel with there left hand and like high end reels. I am currently in the market to pick up a new muskie reel and i was hoping to get a high speed reel for my jerkbait rod. I was hoping to get a low profile reel with a high gear ratio.  i have several Abu Garcia Revo Toro's in the winch model and the original Toro model. I was really hoping to get a Toro High Speed to round out my set ups. well i was in for a surprise when i started to look for a tackle shop in GTA to pick up a high speed reel.  I called everyone from JB's to Gagnons including the big box stores and nobody had a high speed reel in muskie size! shimano makes the tranx which is right hand only, and the curado EJ  which is also right hand only.  Abu Garcia as i mentioned makes the Toro High Speed but its right hand only.  so i was left with one option the Daiwa Lexa 300 HSL which is left hand retrieve and reels in 32 inches of line per crank. the only downside is it is still a bit small(comparable in size to the curado 300) Thankfully fellow musky nut Stacy at protackle sorted me out and i think i have found a suitable replacement.  Since when did left hand retrieve get left in the dark with no reels/models? is cost/profits steering reel manufacturers to just simply stop producing high end reels in left hand retrieve? how many fisherman on this boar reel with there left??  I did a bunch of research to see which reels pick up the most line per crank so if anyone else is looking for a high speed reel, here is the line per crank for the following reels. I thought i would share it with the community.  Revo Toro 60 High Speed - 30.9 inches Revo Toro 60 NAcl - 26 inches Revo Toro 60 Winch - 22 inches Shimano Calcutta 400D - 27 inches Shimano Curado EJ - 32 inches Daiwa Lexa 300HSL - 32.4 Inches  Daiwa is also going to release a 400 series Lexa with a power handle and it brings in 37 inches per crank!!"
798762,bare foot wader,2013-07-18 18:23:00,1354,"I feel your pain, wish shimano made trinidad's in LH"
798765,kickingfrog,2013-07-18 18:33:00,8333,I understand your frustration but until the last 20 years or so left hand baitcasters did not readily exist in the first place.
798767,Roy,2013-07-18 18:52:00,13728,"I use lefties but I don't think it much matters when you're trolling. As far as casting reels go, I just don't think that high speed reels are efficient for muskie fishing."
798775,Fisherpete,2013-07-18 19:18:00,1814,"Since you are a dying breed, and can't get reels, I would like to help you out by taking all your St Croix LT rods. That's what friends are for.  Seriously though - I don't get it - and am curious to know the reel makers reasons. It must all come down to profitability. Write them a stern-worded letter stating that they are a bunch of ""handists""!  Pete"
798776,SylvanOwner,2013-07-18 19:21:00,266,"I'm a left-handed cranker as well and just use AbuGarcia 5501.  24 inches per full handle rotation, I think.  What ""suitable replacement"" did Stacy find for you?"
798777,aplumma,2013-07-18 19:24:00,6896,Funny I am a lefty in every thing I do except for baitcasters... It feels natural to use my left arm to control the rod not crank the real. I will say the lexa 300 is an excellent reel. Mind you I use it for saltwater and big cats the muskie has so far eluded me on my trips up North. On a side note the okuma Clarion which I don't know if it is made as a lefty is an excellent reel if you can switch to the round body reels.    Art
798787,bare foot wader,2013-07-18 19:47:00,1354,"that's exactly right, I'm right handed, so I prefer my dominant hand (stronger grip, slightly more coordination) to hold the rod and impart action and reel with my left, non dominant hand...I can get by wtih right handed trolling reels though...except for saltwater/sturgeon, I back the drag off slight more than I usually would, not a biggie but paying top dollar for a reel I would prefer left hand"
798795,Christopheraaron,2013-07-18 19:59:00,3525," Yup. Always get a laugh watching guys reeling righty where they have to switch hands every cast, left is right!"
798799,Joeytier,2013-07-18 20:11:00,3990,"I'm right handed and couldnt imagine using a right hand retrieve baitcaster.  Even using righties for trolling is very awkward, and i couldnt imagine switching hands every cast..."
798815,scugpg,2013-07-18 20:38:00,1373,have they came out with a decent left hand trolling reel yet? If only they would make a lefty tekota...
798816,boombap,2013-07-18 20:42:00,310,"I'm right handed but reel with my left. I tried a right handed reel before and it felt very awkward.  Mind you, when I'm shooting pool I hold the cue with my left and balance with my right. I'm weird"
798840,lew,2013-07-18 21:29:00,12766,"I'm right handed and reel with my right hand.  Do whatever the heck feels best to YOU, not what somebody says you SHOULD be doing."
798847,BucktownAngler,2013-07-18 21:58:00,582,"i feel your pain, im a righty too, and need a LH crank. ive been trying to find something ""tranx-like"" in LH for double 10s.  was doing some research on the Avet SXJ MC...still not too sure about it yet though   im using a LH Okuma coldwater trolling reel. im sure its no tekota, but i love it. caught a nice 43"" last weekend on it"
798848,Bondar,2013-07-18 22:08:00,817,Avet ?
798851,bare foot wader,2013-07-18 22:25:00,1354,"avet reels, actually entirely made in the US, they make high end round casting reels, especially known for multi speed reels, used a lot for surf and salt fishing, have a cult like following for sturgeon too, they're a bit pricey and kinda hard to find...they might also make a reel with dual drags, on each side of the spool, can get up to 100 lbs of drag pressure, if not avet, it's another us reel company that makes a dual drag  I just wish shimano made the trinidads or tekota in LH...I don't understand the guys who flip/cast with their right hand and then swap over to their left hand lol but to each their own"
798854,davey buoy,2013-07-18 22:36:00,5505,"Don't even know I'm doing it,seems normal  to me lol.And a spinning reel I crank with my left.Odd but it works for me ."
798855,Bondar,2013-07-18 22:36:00,817,"They do make a dual drag , its the Raptor model also a 46"" per turn retrieve I believe"
798859,Dan668,2013-07-18 23:01:00,1120,"I was eyeing an Avet, but am not sure of its performance. Think i may just grab a toro nacl, even though im not a fan of Abu reels."
798861,SirWhite,2013-07-18 23:02:00,210,"I'm a lefty and starting to get into Musky fishing. Right now I'm using the C4 5601 and it feels cheap after reeling in my Revo STXs. Just doesn't feel sure of it itself hulking in my Belivers and D10s. I was looking for the hs Toro 61 as well and discovered its a ""no go"" itd be nice to pick up all that line quicker when jerking and trolling.  You wanna sell me your old Toro?lol"
798864,lew,2013-07-18 23:09:00,12766," The C4 is a poor choice for cranking large musky baits, specially the big bladed ones and forget about burning them.  A good choice is the Abu 7000 as it's inexpensive but does a very good job. Huge spool and power handle makes big baits a breeze and it's also excellent for jerkbaiting and taking up slack in a hurry.  Not fancy or smooth, but it gets the job done."
798875,Raf,2013-07-19 00:12:00,3495,that new daiwa 400 series in left sounds like just the ticket  i am/will be using an avet this year when i get a chance to get out.
798899,Rich Nelson,2013-07-19 02:29:00,332,Got to see the new Daiwa Lexa 400 at Icast. Very nice reel for the price!
798900,Nipfisher,2013-07-19 02:29:00,2449,"I use a left hand retrieve Shimano Castaic on a 7'2"" Compre Musky rod for casting and also have a right hand retrieve Currado on a 7' All Star Bad Boy rod. I have to switch hands twice using the currado set up as I switch to cast then reel with the right hand then switch again for figure 8 and cast.  My trolling rod is also right hand retrieve, it is a Shimnano Calcutta on a 8' Compre Musky rod.  I am not efficient reeling in with my right hand and certainly can't burn baits but I feel I do get a bit better every time."
798902,mike rousseau,2013-07-19 02:33:00,4661,Yup... I'm hanging on to my lefties... Have a Curado 301 and a quantum cabo that both work great...
