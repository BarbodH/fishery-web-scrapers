799318,FloatnFly,2013-07-21 14:19:00,1640,"so i got out to the pier last night to see if any salmon are lurking yet, no deal.   but i did have an issue with my line, the spool of line started to free spin on the reel spool, 15lb braid p-line  has anyone else had this issue on a spinning reel?  on a side note, unspooling and respooling line with no flashlight and then trying to tie a surgeons knot in the dark, is nomt recommended lol, had to use the light from my ipod to try and see, only lost about 20yrds of line due to the birds nest from unspooling"
799320,Roy,2013-07-21 14:37:00,13728,Put 10 yards of mono on there first. (during daylight)
799322,DropShot'r,2013-07-21 14:50:00,62,"I suspect that you tied the braid directly to your spool. Braid tied directly to a spool will spin.  You should either take the line off the spool to the knot carefully( a big yard is the best) and add a piece of electrical tape over the knot then crank everything back up. This will prevent line from spinning. Or add some mono to your braid to fill the spool up properly, then remove all the line from the spool and attach the mono to your spool first then reel back up. I do the latter. With 150yd. spool of braid as the norm I have my reels set up with enough backing that 75yds of braid fills the spools properly. this way I can fill two reels with one spool of braid. My new baitcasters have holes in the spool to attach the line and this eliminates line spin.  Good luck, Steve"
799328,Rich,2013-07-21 15:13:00,3927,"Yessir as suggested you need some backing! Hockey tape, electrical tape or mono work, but ya gotta have something there."
799330,manitoubass2,2013-07-21 15:30:00,11391,"All these suggestions work. One thing ill add is you can tie braid directly to a spill by just tying a simple overhand knot, then wrap the line two or three times around the spool, then tie a second overhand knot."
799338,FloatnFly,2013-07-21 16:10:00,1640,"I'll go with the tape over the knot idea, since this is my salmon casting outfit, i'd like to keep as much braid on there as i can"
799392,davey buoy,2013-07-21 21:15:00,5505,Where I knot the braid on the spool is where I attach the electrical tape.Haven't had one rod slip yet.
799458,BillM,2013-07-22 12:27:00,17367,"Electrical tape or a few yards of mono will work just fine.  Lucky you didn't hook up with a fish because you would have gotten spooled, lol!"
799463,FloatnFly,2013-07-22 13:10:00,1640,  lol i woulda put on my cloth glove and started hand lining  or try to snap my fluoro leader
