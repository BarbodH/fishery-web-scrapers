798709,Old Ironmaker,2013-07-18 13:36:00,8243,"Wonderful Dave. Perch are not hitting like before the heat wave and east winds here at Nanticoke either. Got many dinks yesterday and a few over 9"". 1 former Stelco guy with me yesterday did get a beauty at 14""s. Should be 20 over 9"". Love those big Erie Pickerel though, don't want any fish just leave me the cheeks please.  All we talked about was prescription medicine, I'll see your 500 milligrams of Crestor and raise you 1000 milligrams of Metformin! Used to be Sex, Drugs and Rock and Roll!"
