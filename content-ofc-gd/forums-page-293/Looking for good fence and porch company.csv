798596,RangerGuy,2013-07-17 20:01:00,564,Anybody know a good contractor. We have a rather large yard to fence and would also like a new porch.
798597,lew,2013-07-17 20:06:00,12766,"If you tell the troops where you live Greg, it'll help narrow it down."
798603,misfish,2013-07-17 21:22:00,29133,"I was thinking,if he offered up steaks baked taters and brews,he would get a crowd from here and have it done in a day."
798609,Roy,2013-07-17 21:45:00,13728, I was thinking the same thing.
798624,Sinker,2013-07-17 22:30:00,8692,Location would definitly help.
798627,RangerGuy,2013-07-17 23:02:00,564,"Hey guys,  You guys are funny LOL!  I'm in the Richmond Hill area."
798628,Fisherman,2013-07-17 23:19:00,7201,"Better be good steak and taters otherwise the fence might be a bit snakey and the porch a bit on a tilt... Oh ya, and don't get the guy with the glasses, his fences are crooked.."
798658,danc,2013-07-18 01:35:00,4677,Such projects aren't rocket science. Ever thought of doing it yourself? I'm sure you'd get lots of good advice here and save yourself a small fortune too.
798671,Sinker,2013-07-18 03:42:00,8692,"How much fence are we talking here? What size porch? I could do it al, but richmond hill is too far. If. Your having a fence building party, supplying the whiskey and steaks, I would consider it  Check your pm's  S."
798679,Twocoda,2013-07-18 06:28:00,4130,"Come on guys....he said RICHmond Hill...money to burn...lol..,,at least get some lobster and scallops out of the deal"
798699,RangerGuy,2013-07-18 11:45:00,564,"Money to burn... really? because I live in Richmond hill....  Reason I'm not doing it myself is time and size.. I have done everything myself in this house (with help from friends when needed) kitchen,bathrooms, plumbing,drywall, stud walls etc and currently building basement.  Do all my own car repairs, recent projects was an entire brake job on my 1990 Chevy pickup front to back including all lines, rotors,calipers,master cylinder etc.., u joints , bearings etc. in the driveway.  I am very capable of doing this myself and will probably do my garage less the concrete pad myself.  We have a large back yard fence will be roughly 225 by 65 wide.  We want a standard privacy wood fence for one side and 6' chain link for other 2 sides,  So if anybody knows a good contractor that would be awesome!"
798925,Rich,2013-07-19 10:27:00,3927,"From the title of this thread I thought you were looking for people to come hang out by your fence, lmao"
799090,leaf4,2013-07-19 23:12:00,2466,lmao after reading it again it would make sense... hahaha.
