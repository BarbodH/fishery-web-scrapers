In fact I probably have only put about 5 hours on my motor this year  But it's been a year filled with memories for sure. Winter was work work work. As many of you know I work for an elevator manufacturer. We were lucky enough to have people notice our success and had a spot on both the Discovery Channel and HGTV so far this year.    I didn't make it ice fishing once but managed to keep the kids occupied by going to over 10 hockey games, going to Comicon and hanging out with friends. Seems my kids have the most fun when we go out with Ryan (The Urban Fisherman)      For those that don't know, we were lucky enough to have a booth donating to us by The Spring Fishing & Boat Show staff   Thanks to all the guys and gals that stopped by to say hi.    When spring came around we did find a little time to hit the water.      Jacob is getting old enough to drive the boat without any issues now   Now I get to troll and let him drive!     I managed one day out on the water with friends, trout opener. It was an awesome day of laughing, catching fish and more laughing.    How's this for stretching your arms out.     One of the biggest reasons we barely got out fishing was because Jacob started playing football (full contact). It was some of the best days to date watching him go from not knowing how to play at all to playing running back and running the ball. Highlight for sure was watching him knock down 2 kids, break 4 tackles and run the ball in for a 60 yard touch down. He starts travel ball in 2 weeks again! BTW he just turned 7 and plays against 7 and 8 year olds.      Work was getting extremely stressful so we packed up the truck and drove to Lake Superior Provincial Park for the July long weekend (yes the weekend). It was exactly what I needed. We basically just hiked for the entire weekend.          The trails weren't exactly flat and groomed. It was awesome. I was really proud of the kids. We did about 8km the one day and it was not easy. But there is nothing like sitting on top of a waterfall and not hearing a thing other than the water.              I love that park and would love to visit more often!  I have also been lucky enough to see a few bands in concert this year... I saw Rush, Chevelle, and Alice In Chains so far and have tickets for Black Sabbath in August  Looking forward to the 5th Fish-A-Thon next weekend and then a week long backcountry canoe trip in Temagami with the family the next weekend."

799331,spincast,2013-07-21 15:33:00,3279,I know the feeling well. Great report - that looks like the Sand river trail at LSPP - what a beautiful hike. Did you make it all the way to the end? A beauty little spot to sit and reflect. Small world - the sponsor for your son's team - my workplace. still almost half a summer left to get out on the Bay.
