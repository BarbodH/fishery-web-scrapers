I have cleaned and checked all connections but still have the fault. I also switched the leads so it would be connectedt to the second battery and the fault followed the leads.
799091,captpierre,2013-07-19 23:27:00,2521,had the same problem.  batteries 7 yrs old.  check the in line fuse. could be blown.  battery could be bad
799095,DRIFTER_016,2013-07-19 23:47:00,10439,"Yep, usually a blown fuse if it's doing that. If the battery is old and not accepting a charge it can boil dry and blow the fuse. If the battery is OK it could also be a short of some kind."
799104,sofabed,2013-07-20 00:23:00,119,I actually switched the fuses and both batteries accept a charge from ther other bank on the charger. It's a 2 bank charger for a 24V electric
799109,DRIFTER_016,2013-07-20 00:38:00,10439,Sounds like a charger issue then.
799149,wormdunker,2013-07-20 07:53:00,1711,"Yup could be bad batteries.  Sulphation is the culprit.  Sulphation is a process of the electrolite sticking to the lead plates, which retards the charging process & now the battery cannot accept a full charge.  Go to www.batterystuff.com They have an excellent tutorial on batteries, chargers & accessories."
799233,sofabed,2013-07-20 23:06:00,119,Thanks for the advice. Today wafted fishing I plugged the charger in and both banks are charging again. Must be a connection issue
