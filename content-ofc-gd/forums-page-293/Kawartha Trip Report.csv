799024,muskylund1,2013-07-19 19:58:00,18,"My brother, nephew and I spent July 6-13 on Lower Buckhorn fishing for Bass and Muskies. The Bass fishing was good, but not great. We caught lots of quality fish in the 1-2 lb range and a few in the 2-4 lb range. Muskie fishing was very good with 21 Muskies boated for the week. Largest was a 47"" Muskie boated by my 13 year old nephew Ben on the first night. We had only been trolling for about 5 minutes when he hooked that Kawartha beauty. It was his first Muskie ever. One of our goals for the trip was to get Ben his first Muskie, but I had no idea it would be such a nice fish.  Of 21 Muskies boated, 11 were caught casting and 10 were caught trolling. All of our trolling fish were taken in the evenings from 7:00 to 10:00. Productive trolling lures were Wiley Headshakers, Wiley Deep Divers and 10"" Jakes. Productive casting lures included bucktails and large soft plastic swimbaits such as Kickin Minnows and Swimmin Joes. For casting we focused on the deep weedlines of large main lake weed beds. For trolling we focused on the Southern end of Deer Bay in the 15' to 25' depths. The Muskies were relating schools of suspended baitfish that were 6' to 10' down over deeper water. There seemed to be an evening peak each night during which large schools of baitfish would get very thick and high in the water column. Experience tells me this is usually because they are being chased by predators.  I hope you all enjoy the pictures.  Tom    "
