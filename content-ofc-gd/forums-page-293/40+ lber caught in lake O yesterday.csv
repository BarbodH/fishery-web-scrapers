798344,siwash,2013-07-16 01:40:00,683,He's right... most years the biggest fish are caught in the first two weeks... Keep in mind that mature king salmon stop feeding in August and start running the creeks by the end of August and right through Oct. I've caught quite a few big kings in August and rarely if ever do they have batifish in their guts or poop in their intestines. They bite out of aggression in August.

798761,HookNrelease,2013-07-18 18:22:00,85,can you imagine how big the 46 lb plus would have been in 2002 had it been caught the first week and not the last week
798809,siwash,2013-07-18 20:26:00,683, Those eggs are well formed WELL before the summer even starts... they just loosen up by late summer...
798908,Freshtrax,2013-07-19 03:00:00,2215,Anyone got a link to a pic of this beastie
798911,siwash,2013-07-19 04:10:00,683,It's on spoonpulles.com... second page...  A 38 lbs was caught too apparently.. yesterday... no pic and the dude does not have a derby ticket... that would have won the weekly prize
799083,Sinker,2013-07-19 22:45:00,8692,"The 38 would only win the weekly, if the 40 holds out until the end.  S."
799128,John Bacon,2013-07-20 02:17:00,3277,  It doesn't work that way any more.  You have to catch the biggest fish of the week to get the weekly prize.  The tournament is 7 weeks long and 7 vehicles are awarded as prizes.  So the 38 pounder would still only be second place regardless of whether the 40 pounder holds.  That has still got to hurt though.
799130,misfish,2013-07-20 02:26:00,29133,"What hurts the most is the entry fee. Can remember when it was the Sun derby,25 bucks and great prizes. Molson big fish."
799134,John Bacon,2013-07-20 02:52:00,3277," Yeah, especially if you want to take someone out for one day."
799148,siwash,2013-07-20 05:26:00,683,i remember when soda pop was  a nickel...
799167,Sinker,2013-07-20 13:53:00,8692,"Read the rules.  If the 40lber holds until the end, he wins the great grand prize....Toyota tundra. That brings all the week two entries up one spot, because you can't win a weekly, and the grand prize.  So, if the 40lber takes it all, all the week two top ten entries will move up a place accordingly.  S."
799179,steverowbotham,2013-07-20 15:38:00,1800,"Congrats to TonyB, thats an awesome fish and prize!My fiancee, Kelli just took 5th place for this week with her 32.74 lber , her new PB !!  I'm pretty excited for her, and a little jealous she gets to do the fish off without me! LOL"
799209,John Bacon,2013-07-20 20:01:00,3277,    I have posted the relevant rules below.  I would say my original statement is correct.  Based on the rules below I don't see the 2nd biggest fish of the week getting a weekly prize.  There are 7 vehicles awarded in a seven week tournament.  Your interpretation would require 8 vehicles to be awarded in a 7 week tournament.   1.Great Grand Prize. There will be one Great Grand Prize awarded to the participant who enters the heaviest salmon overall in the tournament.  1a. Grand Prize. There will be six Grand Prizes awarded to the participant who enters the heaviest salmon in each of the six remaining weeks of the Tournament. The winner will be ineligible to win any other major prize.
799230,fishinguypat,2013-07-20 22:42:00,547,A friend of mine caught a 34 lber this week but wasn't registered in the tourney.. the big boys are out there
799232,Sinker,2013-07-20 22:46:00,8692,Keep reading rules.  The guy with the biggest fish in the derby does not win two prizes....its quite clear.  Biggest fish over all from any week wins great grand prize.....that same person does not win a weekly prize.  Understand?  Its all in the rules.  S.
799234,Pikeslayer,2013-07-20 23:12:00,1443,Tournament is 7 full weeks. 6 Matrix + 1 Tundra = 7 'grand prizes'. Entries from the 'tundra winning week' do not move up a place accordingly. That would require an additional Matrix.
799274,John Bacon,2013-07-21 02:33:00,3277, Nobody said anything about one person winning two prizes for one fish.  I am not sure where you are getting that from.  The discussion was about whether the second largest fish of the week would win the weekly grand prize if the largest fish of that week turned out to be the largest fish of the derby.  The second largest fish would still only be second place; but the winner for that week would get a nicer truck than the other weekly winners.
798033,siwash,2013-07-14 11:31:00,683,That the first 40+ salmon from Cdn waters in years...  That guy should win it...
798038,captpierre,2013-07-14 12:38:00,2521,incredible!  piss your pants size
798055,FloatnFly,2013-07-14 14:10:00,1640,"don't be surprised to see more 40lb + salmon this summer, specially when they start to produce eggs"
798056,wormdunker,2013-07-14 14:12:00,1711,"Where did he catch it?  Pleez don't tell me ""right by the lip"".  LOL!"
798061,Sinker,2013-07-14 14:32:00,8692,"Weighed in port hope.  There was one entered last year as well. They're out there, and even bigger.  S."
798065,206,2013-07-14 14:55:00,563,I heard the rumor in town here last night. That would be quite the fish!!
798083,Ralph Field,2013-07-14 16:05:00,1018,"Hope he was entered in the tourney, as it may be the largest fish entered."
798085,Sinker,2013-07-14 16:07:00,8692,"Ya, it was entered in the derby, and its on top as of right now. Might hold out, but I know there are some big fish out there this year, lots of bait, and they only get bigger from here on out! Don't be surprised if there are bigger fish entered!  S."
798086,Roy,2013-07-14 16:08:00,13728,"Is it still at rumour stage or is there documentation somewhere...a pic perhaps? It'd be nice to see.  OOPS, sorry Sinker...hadn't seen your post."
798092,captpierre,2013-07-14 16:34:00,2521,"Anybody know if a money fish like this gets checked for added weight like lead, rocks stuffed inside?"
798093,Spiel,2013-07-14 16:36:00,9065,Daily updates for the GOSD here...........  http://www.greatontariosalmonderby.ca/updates/
798096,Roy,2013-07-14 16:48:00,13728,Thanks Chris.
798099,fishindevil,2013-07-14 17:01:00,6254,"Yes the fish is kept frozen and verified and given back to the guy a fish of that size is checked !!!! That's an awesome king for sure !!!! Hope he wins ... There will still be some monsters weighed in at port credit and bronte yet. !!!! Those fish will gain 1-2lbs a week from here on in !!!! Great sign to see a 40 in the derby !!!!!! Cheers to the guy !!! ""Clink"""
798100,chessy,2013-07-14 17:07:00,610,bet you that fish is chalked full of golbies thank god for the round golbies as they are making the fish bigger and healthier
798102,captpierre,2013-07-14 17:23:00,2521,didn't think Kings feed on gobies on the bottom?
798107,Sinker,2013-07-14 17:52:00,8692,"Gobies??? hahaha  I doubt it! These are open water fish, that feed on schools of baitfish. They don't hang around port hope harbour eating gobies!!  A mature chinook can gain 10 lbs in a summer. That's a lot of gobies! lol  S."
798108,Sinker,2013-07-14 17:53:00,8692,"And yes, fish gets checked for sure. Also, the fisherman can be given a lie detector test if there are any questions.  S."
798113,Roy,2013-07-14 18:44:00,13728,A lie detector...pretty sad state of affairs when you need to go that far for a fishing tourney.
798114,misfish,2013-07-14 18:52:00,29133,"Seems to be a hatchery fish.  Just pasting what I read.  It was a huge salmon,  with an Adipose fin Clip which suggests that it was aHtchery rasied fish.     Theres a reason for that. You be surprised me brudder what one will do to win ."
798119,jace,2013-07-14 19:05:00,472,some derbies check otoliths for identifying heat marks and also genetics tests.  It's nothing to ship a fish in from across the country/state or from another water system if the prize is big enough.
798121,fishindevil,2013-07-14 19:46:00,6254,Those kings are feeding on alewives and just gorging !!!!! They don't eat gobies off the bottom !!! I wish they did .... The 8lb smallies in Erie and simcoe are eating gobies !!!!!! The kings ply the open water and chase down schools of baitfish !!!!
798122,captpierre,2013-07-14 20:00:00,2521,fishermen lie?
798172,boombap,2013-07-15 01:09:00,310,^ lol
798230,Fish Farmer,2013-07-15 12:35:00,2234,"As the derby progresses the fish start getting smaller. That fish has reached its prime. now it's down hill. Every year that happens, the largest fish is caught in the first week."
798325,FloatnFly,2013-07-15 23:27:00,1640,  so you're sayimg the females get smaller as they GAIN 5-10lbs in eggs???
