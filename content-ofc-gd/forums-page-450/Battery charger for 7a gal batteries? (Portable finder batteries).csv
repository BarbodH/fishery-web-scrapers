657142,BillM,2012-01-16 21:33:00,17367,"I've had the worst luck with these chargers...  The one that came with my Humminbird portable pack lasted 1 year, my replacement just died on me today.  There's gotta be something better out there...  What are you guys using?"
657145,misfish,2012-01-16 21:41:00,29133,Home hardware has a 1.5 amp charger. I use this for mine.
657148,johnnyb,2012-01-16 21:45:00,3413,I always used the one that came with my Aqua Vu.....misplaced it so I went to a hobby shop and got a new one for $10.  Just a big fat plug with a red LED on it and alligator clips...nothing fancy
657149,Terry,2012-01-16 21:47:00,14456,well sadly enough you have little choice but to use that type of charge most bigger chargers will not recognize 7 amps as needing to be charged .
657150,DRIFTER_016,2012-01-16 21:50:00,10439,"Bill you can always pick up one of the CTEK 3300 chargers. I think these little guys would be perfect for charging smaller batteries. They are a little spendy but seem to come on sale every year. If you can find it the Marcum DCS 100 is a good charger, but is now discontinued."
657156,scugpg,2012-01-16 22:01:00,1373,CTEK 3300 works great on them - and it will do larger batteries too.
657168,irishfield,2012-01-16 22:23:00,26272,"Bill.. I'm sure you don't have to look toooo far around the house. You want between a 300ma and 750 ma x 12 volt DC transformer to charge a 7 Ahr battery. I use a 1000 ma one for my double 9Ahr's I use in my finder... it's the charger for my 10 million candle power flashlight.  300 ma to 500 would be perfect... and the general size of all those wireless link adapters that I'm sure you have access to many of....  REMEMBER.. once that green light comes on on those Aqua View, Hummingbird, Marcum etc ""chargers"" comes on that it doesn't shut off... it continues to BOIL your battery!!"
657173,DRIFTER_016,2012-01-16 22:26:00,10439, Unless you buy one of the multi stage ones like the Marcum DCS 100 or Vexilar V-410.
657175,Sinker,2012-01-16 22:27:00,8692,"I have been using the same charger I use for my deep cycles for 4 years now on mine. Works fine.  Its a nautilus deep cycle charger. Just set it on 2A charge, and wait till the little green light comes on, then go fishing.  S."
657176,BillM,2012-01-16 22:28:00,17367,"Wayne, I could definitely bastardize a normal wall charger   Lots of those around the house!"
657177,Roy,2012-01-16 22:29:00,13728,"Same as a security system charger, Bill. I just swap mine out when I need a battery. They're always fully charged."
657192,irishfield,2012-01-16 22:51:00,26272,  It's all you need and will charge them nicely and at the correct rate. If you want to make it pretty (if you're using a homemade case)... I think I still have some male and female black and red sockets and plugs around here to put on the case and cord. Otherwise just go into the Source or similar and get a couple alligator clips.
657206,aplumma,2012-01-16 23:15:00,6896, You know that is genius to think of that Roy. A free charger and your alarm system battery tested frequently.   Art
657215,Rob,2012-01-16 23:34:00,467,"I use these chargers, these work great and they go on sale quite a bit for about 40 bucks.They have auto shut off and have a 3 year warranty.  Rob C"
657218,misfish,2012-01-16 23:41:00,29133,"  Nice avatar.  Who,s fish btw?"
657225,Rob,2012-01-16 23:45:00,467, Come out and I'll show you how!  Rob
657389,Lunker Larry,2012-01-17 15:31:00,122,Could you be overcharging the battery? My Marcum says to charge 2 hrs for every 3 hrs of use. Although the charger is very low ouput (500 mA or 1/2 amp) it can damage the battery if left on for extended periods of time after the charge cycle is complete.
657400,BillM,2012-01-17 15:58:00,17367,"Larry, it's very possible.   I put both my batteries on my big charger lastnight, set it to 2a and it took a few hours to charge the one battery.  Other battery might be toast, I could hear it boiling and quickly unplugged it."
657598,Lunker Larry,2012-01-18 01:54:00,122,If the battery is boiling it sounds like it is fried. The charger battery is unable to accept the charge but the charger doesn't know it and keeps on pumping juice to it causing it to boil.
657619,bubbles,2012-01-18 02:38:00,591,"   Yep, me too. This post has me confused, I just kept thinking....just use your deep cycle charger"
657620,fishnsled,2012-01-18 02:39:00,3520,  Wayne has got it here. I was told this many years ago when using a charger on a snowmobile battery. My sled buddy said to used nothing over 1 amp. When buying a battery for my GPS to use why traveling on the sled in the winter the place (Total Battery in Barrie) Total Battery recommended this charger (link from another site.) Enerwatt It's been working like a charm for the last 3 years and the battery is still fine. I think I paid about $25 for the charger
657621,BillM,2012-01-18 02:44:00,17367,"Bubbles, that's what I did lastnight and it worked like a charm..  I think that's exactly what I'll do in the future."
658056,jim,2012-01-19 14:10:00,124,Hope this isn't a repeat.  Sail in Oshawa has 7amp chargers for 14.95.
