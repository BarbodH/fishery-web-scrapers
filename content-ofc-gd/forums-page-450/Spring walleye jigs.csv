657260,Roy,2012-01-17 01:15:00,13728,"I started making some of these recently. These are 1.5 ounce buck tail jigs....a standard tie with a few dark vertical lines in the buck tail using an indelible marker. Add a trailer of some kind to them for the short biters and I'm in business. You have to go much smaller in the summer but in the spring and fall, these are great here. Fifty or sixty and I'm good for the season.  "
657262,kickingfrog,2012-01-17 01:17:00,8333,Sure are purdy. I know they would catch fishermen.
657264,Terry,2012-01-17 01:21:00,14456,they are pretty bet they work well too
657265,Roy,2012-01-17 01:22:00,13728,There's an area just off the shipping channel east of here where they're particularly good.
657268,irishfield,2012-01-17 01:27:00,26272,What's the retail on them....    I know a place where the waves grow bigger than the specks... that they'd work welll on tooooo
657271,Rod Caster,2012-01-17 01:36:00,5784,"Great looking buck tails Roy. 1.5 oz is fairly heavy, those must be some good sized walleye your catching with them.  And, I thought all markers were inedible... Oh wait I think I read that wrong"
657272,Roy,2012-01-17 01:42:00,13728,You're kinda right. These a special dual purpose markers. Both indelible AND inedible.
657279,mercman,2012-01-17 02:07:00,7054, You are a real MASTER at making those baits Bud !!! 1.5 oz because of the current Roy?
657283,Roy,2012-01-17 02:13:00,13728,"Yes Paul but also in the spring and fall, there are a few spots that hold very good sized fish and these jigs with a trailer do the job. More than half the fish fall to the trailer. You can buy them almost anywhere in those sizes (up to 6 ounces or so actually) but I kinda like whiling away the cold season messing with them."
657285,mercman,2012-01-17 02:21:00,7054,"we gotta get us some then, don't we?"
657286,Roy,2012-01-17 02:25:00,13728,Can at least give it a try eh?
657288,mike rousseau,2012-01-17 02:29:00,4661, Youd be surprised...  I only run 1oz jigs or bigger due to current...  I get fish of all sizes... They hit and don't let go...   Really nice baits Roy
657327,lew,2012-01-17 10:18:00,12766,Very impressive work indeed Roy !!  You've been turning out some really nice baits in the last few years.
657328,Billy Bob,2012-01-17 10:30:00,5865,REAL PURDY Roy.........I make my own jigs also....use to make them for sale to local bait and tackle stores years ago....it's a nice hobby for the winter that buys a lot of fishing gear come spring.
657329,Roy,2012-01-17 10:37:00,13728,"Thanks Lew, means a lot coming from you. Yeah Bob it's a good pastime because almost anyone can make them. You don't need a lot of space and you can pick it up or leave it without having to setup tools or anything. I don't sell them though."
657366,corvette1,2012-01-17 14:24:00,1765,awesome looking jigs Roy
657369,Moosebunk,2012-01-17 14:31:00,3970,Looking good Roy.  Tying is a great hobbie too... doing up 60 jigs takes the cap off the laquer bottle that many more times too.  Wooooo hooey hoo fun!!!
657393,Leecher,2012-01-17 15:48:00,7832,"They look great Roy At 1.5oz, it's the perfect weight to get down on bottom in the area you are fishing And I agree, always a good idea to add a trailer / stinger for the short bitters Thanks for sharing Jacques"
657433,Harrison,2012-01-17 17:04:00,2202,Sharp Roy!  1.5oz would be really nice for rip jiggin the thick arse weeds on some of the Kawartha's.  Nice little work out too.
657473,fishindevil,2012-01-17 19:25:00,6254,they look awesome roy !!!! well done...
657531,TennesseeGuy,2012-01-17 22:30:00,957,Beauties.  Truly the work of an artist.
657571,esoxansteel,2012-01-18 00:48:00,1307,"  They look great Roy, any GPS coordinates on the hotspot, or is it somewhere East of Montreal but before the Atlantic Ocean"
657576,Roy,2012-01-18 01:05:00,13728,"Sure, I have no problem with that. How about this? Latitude/Longitude:     Degrees, Minutes, Seconds: 46째 3' 40"" N 73째 4' 14"" W   Decimal Degrees: 46.061째 N 73.071째 W   UTM Coordinates:  18T 649228 5102652   Topographic Map Sheet Number: 031I03"
