657325,Mikeyfish,2012-01-17 07:14:00,21,"  I have been to your site and I see you like aluminum. I'm starting a new build in the next day or so and you might a have some answers for me. I'm building a 6 x 14 foot aluminum paddle boat, ice hut, for thin, slush or no ice. I want to skim across thin ice and without stepping on the ice and use this also in the summer. What do I need to put on the aluminum to make it side without sticking to the snow or icing up. I don't want anything that will give me a keel ,The bottn must stay flat. I'll draw a picture soon of the platform to see what you think  Mike"
