657074,mercman,2012-01-16 16:58:00,7054,"This question has probably been answered somewhere in here, but i cant find the answer. As an out of province angler(im in Quebec) with an outdoors card and yearly sports licence for Ontario, can my wife fish with me, under the same license, and share a quota?"
657078,kickingfrog,2012-01-16 17:12:00,8333, Simple answer: No.
657087,mercman,2012-01-16 17:49:00,7054,  Good !! That means i get to fish by myself in Ontario!!! Hope she doesn't see this though
657089,Skipper D,2012-01-16 18:07:00,1970,  ..... wheres the defibralator  .... sorry Paul .....
657108,Joey,2012-01-16 19:27:00,9122,"Just got my 3 year in the mail today and as Terry says, what a relief I won't have do deal with any incompetence for another 3 years.  Can't understand why they still have the same outdoors card picture, that Smallie we've had forever now.  Would be nice to get a new pic on it"
657109,kickingfrog,2012-01-16 19:33:00,8333, Like a carp pulled though an ice hole?
657110,mercman,2012-01-16 19:39:00,7054,"  Just remember Skip, you can't fish anywhere you want, with an Outdoors card and Ontario License. Well YOU can, but most of US cant"
657122,Skipper D,2012-01-16 20:34:00,1970,
657132,Raf,2012-01-16 20:59:00,3495,i used to buy them 1 year at a time but going forward i think i'll do 3 years.  this year my card expires (and if i am not mistaken they are good for 3 years) so I get a 3 year card and 3 year license.
657139,Twocoda,2012-01-16 21:15:00,4130,Every 3 yeara for me ....one less thing to deal with in life ...if they had a ten year ...i would probably get that
657154,kickingfrog,2012-01-16 21:57:00,8333,Would you even need the whole ten years?
657217,Dutch,2012-01-16 23:40:00,831,"   Do you guys cheat on your taxes as well?  Some information for you - license money is the only funds in the MNR budget that goes directly to fund Ontario Sportfishing Enforcement and protection.  So, it's not extra money, or cheating them from money, it is taking away from the resource we all love and cherish.  I always buy a sport fishing license and always have, since I turned 18 and needed to buy a license.  I always try to buy 3 years at a time, just to avoid the hassle of renewing.  Since I now fish with a BASS club and have done a couple of tourneys over the past couple of years I have needed the sport license, but before that time, a conservation license would have sufficed.  I bought the more expensive license because I have always known that money goes directly back to fishing, unlike some other fees that the government charges.  I dislike the conservation license aspect of Ontario legislation.  It makes no sense, there is no less work that has to be done depending on how many fish you want to keep.  I encourage those that can choose betwen a conservation license and sport license to buy the latter - the money goes directly back into our passion."
657224,lew,2012-01-16 23:45:00,12766,I've always purchased the 3 year sport simply because of the convenience.
657239,spinnerbaitking,2012-01-17 00:13:00,1622,"I always bought 3 yr Sport fishing and small game, even though we hardly ever eat Fish & haven`t hunted for a number of years, hopefully I`ll take up Bow hunting if I can stop fishing for Bass before the end of November lol SBK"
657248,Billy Bob,2012-01-17 00:33:00,5865,I don't buy one......they cost too much....
657284,Twocoda,2012-01-17 02:13:00,4130, lol....yep....still haver 19 years to go before its free to me....unless they will honour my mental disabilities and give me one earlier...
657302,skeeter,2012-01-17 04:06:00,1907,"I buy the 3 year for both my wife and myself. As said before, LESS headaches including the one that a lot of people are going threw with this fiasco of the new format that they are implementing now.."
657341,Jer,2012-01-17 12:24:00,1426,   ...if at all possible.
657343,Billy Bob,2012-01-17 12:27:00,5865, Tell him Jer.....you're just trying to get back some that they stole from you all year long....
657345,wantabigone,2012-01-17 12:50:00,97,"I get the 3 year, always have. Saves on time(not having to do it every year) and if there are any price increases in the meantime i save a bit."
656740,Bob Devine,2012-01-15 05:57:00,251,Just curious what most do when buying their fishing license. Do you buy a 1yr or 3 yr and why?  I buy a 1 yr license because we don't get a discount and why give the government extra money.  Like most I frequent numerous shops to pick up a license at my convenience.
656742,GYPSY400,2012-01-15 07:10:00,191,"I usually buy 1 year, but this year my wife surprised me with a 3 year sport as a Christmas present.. Should get it in the mail sometime in Febuary!  I think from now on I'm going to go with the 3 year as the last few years I've been having to make "" one more stop"" before going out on the first trip in the spring.. Seems I always forget that small detail!"
656747,Terry,2012-01-15 10:24:00,14456,I get a 3 year cause it's 2 less times I have to deal with the morons doing the licenses that alone is worth the price
656748,pikehunter,2012-01-15 10:39:00,1659,"Last renewal I bought a 3 year for my wife and myself, that way I beat the HST ! That was the only reason, figured it was the easiest and only legal way to cheat the government out of some tax money...even if only for a few bucks."
656749,Roy,2012-01-15 10:52:00,13728," Good point Terry. I always get a 3 year sports as well but I seldom keep fish. I haven't got my Ontario license for this year yet but it'll only be a one year because apparently the Ontario government think that as of July this year, I'm too old to pay. It's a super deal and you should appreciate it cause here in Quebec, they knock a whole $2. off a one year license once you hit 65 years of age and we've been dealing with cash register receipt format forever.  And while we're on the subject of permits and such, not being an Ontario resident, I have no say but I find the sportsman/conservation thing a little bewildering. Whether you're fishing for the pleasure of fishing or fishing to bring something to the table, you're still using the resource and therefore should be paying for a full sportsman license. That's should be especially true for non Ontario residents... in other words, if I'm fishing someone elses turf, I should be paying my way. I know that this might open up a can of worms but it's my opinion now and has been for a while."
656750,Skipper D,2012-01-15 11:18:00,1970,"I understand what your saying and i think your being to honest Roy , is it not ok for every one to pay once , then be able to go fish where ever in this perticular country ?"
656751,Roy,2012-01-15 11:27:00,13728," Well sure, every Province needs their natural resource revenue so take the 13 jurisdictions and multiply it by $30 or so and you have a fishing license that costs you $390. for a year. It's a little steep if you're fish one or two Provinces eh?"
656752,Skipper D,2012-01-15 11:39:00,1970,  Each jurisdiction recieves its funds from the same place dose it not ?
656753,Handlebarz,2012-01-15 11:50:00,3790,3 year sport. I just started buying it when I started musky fishing this way I don't have to deal with the people who get mad for others targeting musky with a conservation license. I rarely keep fish and with dad passing it will be down to almost 0 from now on unless I am asked for them
656754,Roy,2012-01-15 11:53:00,13728," Ok folks, I think we're losing this one. Pass me the electric paddles! CLEAR! Oops...cleanup in aisle 42."
656756,Skipper D,2012-01-15 11:59:00,1970,"Am i right in  understanding what your saying , is every angler is to have a license for each jurisdiction , and that my reasoning of paying once per person and fish where ever is incorrect . I just don't like paying over and over for the same thing is all ."
656757,Handlebarz,2012-01-15 12:02:00,3790,Oh yeah I forgot the most important part my reason for a 3 year is the same as Terry I was sick of the hassle of getting a sticker and with 1 place in Chatham (city hall) it was a pain as they just did it on line for you but you had to answer all the same questions.  Or I could drive 20 min to get it. So three year it is from now on 1 time renewal online and done with them.
656759,lew,2012-01-15 12:06:00,12766, Thanks for that Roy
656765,okumasheffield,2012-01-15 12:46:00,318,I always get 3-years to beat ever-increasing costs (for everything) in this world even though it would only make more sense if any discount available
656767,Garnet,2012-01-15 12:57:00,2056,"Every 3 years I get a renewal notice, walk into to house and phone."
656768,NAW,2012-01-15 13:01:00,4022,"^X2^  The price seems to go up every year.  I get 3 year sport and 3 year small game.  It ends up saving you a few bucks, and you don't have to worry about buying a new liscence every year.  Mine was $163 for 3 years.  $54 a year."
656771,Rod Caster,2012-01-15 13:25:00,5784,"Skip.. The money from provincial fishing lisences goes into the Provinces ""account""; it doesn't go into a Canadian ""account"". Each province (fishing jurisdiction) is responsible for itself. Since each province does different things with their fishing resources, they have to charge seperate and different fees for a license. Hope this helps.  I buy the one year because I'm cheap. And also because the option of a 3-yr wasn't available to me online. I don't know why."
656774,kickingfrog,2012-01-15 13:43:00,8333, Same here. I've also switched to the 2 year licences sticker for my car for the same reason.   The only problem is remembering which year it expires. I usually have brief panic attack every December or January.
656780,bubbles,2012-01-15 14:13:00,591,"I buy the three year, it's one less thing I will forget to do."
656782,Woodsman,2012-01-15 14:24:00,1286," Three year option is only available on the year you renew your Outdoors Card. I just renewed my card & fishing license for 3 years. Every year in the past it has been a big hassle to get your new license & be ready for New Years day. In the past the MNR has been late getting the stickers to the retailers & now with the new system many places are still not on-line line due to training issues. Also with the hassles of the new system many places just said screw it, as it's not worth the hassle for them."
656789,Skipper D,2012-01-15 15:05:00,1970,"  RC ,thank you thank you thank you , now 'i'll be able to hold a conversation with the best of them should it ever come up again ."
657049,dsn,2012-01-16 15:28:00,1018,I always go with the 3yr. Buy and Forget it!
657056,Tootsie II,2012-01-16 16:03:00,162,"Up til last year I always bought 3 yr Sport fishing and small game.  Because I hit the magic 65 this year, I only bought 3 yr small game and 1 yr Sport last year. Now I have to go buy a one year Sport to get me to August. Why the ""darn"" government didn't stay with the sticker system is a real mystery. Some consultant probably made a gazillion dollars talking the gov't into this new system where you also have to carry another piece of paper. I'm being polite here so as not to get the moderator(s) angry at me!"
657057,SlowPoke,2012-01-16 16:07:00,2984,I buy it a year at a time. I figure it gives me a couple extra opportunities to visit with Steve at Lambeth Rod & Tackle!
657062,Woodsman,2012-01-16 16:25:00,1286,"I believe the reason behind ""the new system"" is so that all information will be available to the CO's on the computer system. Under the older system when a sticker was sold (in particular at a private retailer) it would not be entered into the system until the paper work was sent into the MNR. Many retailers would hold on to the paperwork until they had quite a few to be sent in. When the MNR received them someone had to be paid to enter the information into the computer system. Under the new system the information is entered at time of sale. Also under the older system it was possible to have the paperwork backdated to cover up an offense. That is one of the reasons you very seldom had a ""fishing without a valid license"" charges laid. It was far simpler to lay a charge of ""failure to produce a valid license"". Proof of this offense was far simpler as whether there was a valid license or not if it wasn't produced it was an offense. Penalty for ""failure to produce a valid license"" is not softer than ""fishing without a valid license"". I don't expect this to change much even though they will be able to confirm a valid license far easier."
