651274,canadadude,2011-12-28 00:52:00,769,"Hey bud, I framed houses for 5yrs and built well over 200 houses and never once used plywood for sheeting on exterior walls. In fact you have to go back 40yrs to find plywood sheeting,good exterior paint should seal it fine, it'a an ice hut not a castle, if in 5 yrs it needs alittle TLC then give it revamp.If you listen to all these internet carpenters you'll be rebuilding the thing 100x over and it'll cost thousands of dollars. Remeber it's an ice hut not a permanent residence."
651354,Fishnwire,2011-12-28 13:08:00,983,"  Yeah, but when you build a house, don't you cover that chipboard with tar paper, and then expect that to be covered with some kind of siding?  I can't remember seeing too many houses with nothing but painted OSB as an exterior.  I've seen a few sheds like that, but not old ones that still look good.  By ""a little TLC"", what do you mean?  If the chipboard has taken on water, swelled or started to break down...another coat or two of paint isn't going to help.  You'll be looking at ripping off the bad stuff and replacing it with new.  If you use OSB again, you'll just be doing it again in a few years.  Why not take it off now, salvage it for your shelves or interior paneling, and use something that will last a lot longer?  It might not be a ""permanent residence"", but there's no reason you can't build something that will last a darn near a lifetime.  Also, just because it's ""[only] an ice hut"", there's no reason it has to be a piece of junk."
651367,Fish Farmer,2011-12-28 14:22:00,2234,"A house is different than a fish hut. You can use what you like, like I said before. I'm just suggesting with my over 30 years building them. Just remember don't leave anything in your hut you don't want stolen, block it up with pieces of wood, not cement blocks, which I have seen.   Keep an eye on the ice conditions for your hut off time. If you leave stuff outside your shack, the wind has away of making things disappear. Ventilation with your heat sources, we want to see your reports not your name in the obits. GPS and compass for whiteout conditions. Enjoy, good fishin, see you on the ice."
651414,Billy Bob,2011-12-28 17:25:00,5865,Have you ever notice that after a wind storm the new homes are missing vinyl siding and shingle on their roofs while the much older homes are intact....ever wonder why that is....most times it's because the newer homes are built with cheap chipboard that doesn't hold the nails as well as plywood....you get what you paid for.  BTW many builders here have now gone back to plywood for roofs and siding....
651416,Gerritt,2011-12-28 17:37:00,6129,"I have been a carpenter for 10+ years, and in the trades for close to 20... cookie cutter homes are built with OSB for sheathing etc... however high end custom (the ones I built) are ply.  But I guess I am an internet carpenter... what do I know...  G."
651418,TDunn,2011-12-28 17:49:00,680,"I'm in the trade also....  bottom line - osb is cheaper/less quality ply- more $$/ better quality  Maybe try some housewrap if you keep the osb and add reflectors?  Anyways, good luck in your shack this winter!  oh and Billybob your siding nails should be hitting studs anyway! haha    TDunn"
651509,lovetofish,2011-12-29 00:22:00,500,"Wow guys.... Didn't mean to start an argument... lol.  We decided to continue with the build and if she needs some TLC in a few years, then so be it.  Got some work done on the roof yesterday, lookin pretty good!!!  The boys and myself are really starting to get excited now!!!  Hear are a few pics..  http://i867.photobucket.com/albums/ab236/lovetofish123/2011-12-27224706.jpg http://i867.photobucket.com/albums/ab236/lovetofish123/2011-12-27224649.jpg http://i867.photobucket.com/albums/ab236/lovetofish123/2011-12-27223920.jpg  Ps.  That is ply on the roof  Were still going to add a roof vent and cover the roof with aluminum. And lots of staining and styrofoam work to do   lovetofish"

657001,Billy Bob,2012-01-16 12:16:00,5865,It looks like it's coming along very nicely......do you have a launch date ?
657044,lovetofish,2012-01-16 15:18:00,500,"Still waiting for enough ice... Hopefully this weekend, but probably next weekend"
650737,lovetofish,2011-12-24 16:24:00,500,"Hey guys. We've been building this hut since September and its coming along quite nicely.  Of course I have gotten some ideas from some of the posts on the board.  It is 12x7, the walls are framed with 2x2, covered with 1/4"" chip board, 1"" styrofoam  http://i867.photobucket.com/albums/ab236/lovetofish123/Wallbuilding.jpg http://i867.photobucket.com/albums/ab236/lovetofish123/Photo-0013.jpg   The floor has 2x10"" runners on the outside  that are connected with 2x4's, we used 2x3's to tie them all together.  There is 3.5"" of insulation in the floor covered with vapor barrier and aluminum.  http://i867.photobucket.com/albums/ab236/lovetofish123/Unpaintedfloor.jpg http://i867.photobucket.com/albums/ab236/lovetofish123/Johnnypainting.jpg http://i867.photobucket.com/albums/ab236/lovetofish123/FinishingSkiis.jpg http://i867.photobucket.com/albums/ab236/lovetofish123/AluminumFloor.jpg http://i867.photobucket.com/albums/ab236/lovetofish123/AluminumFloor2.jpg http://i867.photobucket.com/albums/ab236/lovetofish123/Benches.jpg http://i867.photobucket.com/albums/ab236/lovetofish123/2011-12-18200534.jpg http://i867.photobucket.com/albums/ab236/lovetofish123/2011-12-18200600.jpg  Were planning on building the roof on Tuesday.  Hope you guys like it!  Merry Christmas.  Lovetofish"
650741,Sinker,2011-12-24 16:59:00,8692,Nice job!~!
650748,RickOnt,2011-12-24 17:43:00,669,"You guys are doing a Great Job!!  It won't take much to heat with all the insulation,  Where are you going to put it? once we get Ice.  Rick"
650749,lovetofish,2011-12-24 17:46:00,500,Start out on cook's bay.... Whenever we get ice. And then move it to IBP later in the season
650756,RickOnt,2011-12-24 18:13:00,669,"Thats a good plan, Once you are set up you can always use it as your base camp and do some running from there.  Rick"
650883,gaspumper,2011-12-25 04:18:00,393,Going to be a nice hut.One question the insulation you put under the floor will it not get water logged and be 150lbs heavier?
650884,lovetofish,2011-12-25 04:25:00,500,Theres vapor barrier and aluminum in between the insulation and the ice... So i hope not
650886,Fishnwire,2011-12-25 04:36:00,983,I seriously considered chipboard for mine...its so much cheaper than ply.  I was worried about it not holding up though.  That stuff really doesn't like getting wet.  Are you going to cover it with anything or treat it?
650888,lovetofish,2011-12-25 04:41:00,500,I'm hoping 2 coats of exterior paint will seal it up
650889,Fishnwire,2011-12-25 04:55:00,983,"If it was just me, I probably would have done that, saved a few bucks and been fine.  My Father-in-law in old school though and has a hate-on for OSB.  I'm going to use it for the ceiling paneling and maybe for my shelving and bunks though.  I'd use it for the wall paneling but I don't want to look at it all day (on those rare occasions) when the fish aren't biting."
650908,dickie,2011-12-25 13:35:00,64,"Nice Hut. Whatever you do, do not let the water level reach the bottom of your insulation because you may think it is waterproof, it is not. That insulation acts like a blotter and even a very small hole can suck up a lot of water. Worse yet if it does get wet, it will never dry out. Good luck in your ice-fishing season."
650910,Terry,2011-12-25 14:18:00,14456,great job
650911,lovetofish,2011-12-25 14:21:00,500,"Thanks for the tip. Were planning on jacking it up, once its up there. Theres 9 inches of clearance, hoping to have the hut long off the ice before that."
650964,bassjnkie,2011-12-25 23:38:00,1101,That's a really nice and well built hut.
651012,lovetofish,2011-12-26 05:07:00,500,It sure helps my buddy daniel does framing for a living!
651016,wkrp,2011-12-26 12:45:00,656,Thats a real fish  palace.
651034,lovetofish,2011-12-26 16:05:00,500,It sure helps my buddy daniel does framing for a living!
651101,Fish Farmer,2011-12-27 02:40:00,2234,"I'd stay away from that chipboard. I used it on my hut and in a couple years it swelled up and started to rot my frame, plus it got heavier. I striped it down and went with plywood then covered it with aluminum printing plates."
651104,lovetofish,2011-12-27 02:58:00,500,Did u paint it?
651123,Billy Bob,2011-12-27 10:24:00,5865," I hate to say it but I have to agree with the Farmer here.....you may get a 2-3 years out of chipboard but it will find the moisture and swell on you.  Here's what I would of recommended for the walls and roof and it would have been much lighter also. For the floor either a 1/2"" exterior grade plywood or marine plywood would of been my choice.  http://www.mccauseylumber.com/ppup.html"
651126,Fish Farmer,2011-12-27 10:49:00,2234,"Paint only locks in the mosture, I had put 3 coats on mine. You can use what you like but I'm just trying to give you a heads up."
651145,bigugli,2011-12-27 14:52:00,6138,"When I was building houses, we refused to ever use chipboard. Would be perfect to use in Arizona and southern California. Here in Canada, moisture is a serious problem, and chipboard degrades quickly."
651148,lovetofish,2011-12-27 15:02:00,500,Do u guys think its best to rip all the chip board off now and use plywood?
651157,Billy Bob,2011-12-27 16:05:00,5865," I would, especially if you screwed in the chipboard as at least you can still use that board for some inside projects around the house....makes good shelving in the garage and basement....but once it starts to absorb moisture it swells and become scrap. Sorry, I know that's not what you want to hear.  Bob"
