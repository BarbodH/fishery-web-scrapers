The place looks different and has awesome snorkeling and diving(want to get certified).  Anyone been? thoughts?  Anyone went fishing? any recommendations?"
657521,barrystrs,2012-01-17 22:06:00,75,"I went snorkeling there.  I was only there a few hrs, but one of the nicest places I have ever seen.  I would like to go back and stay a week."
657525,Rattletrap2,2012-01-17 22:22:00,1652,"I'll second that opinion! I was there as part of a cruise last March. We spent the day at a secluded local beach and loved it! We snorkelled all day out to a reef that was loaded with fish. I think I still might have our drivers card somewhere. I went outside the ships port to find this local guy and he showed us some amazing places for a real good price. He picked up his wife, kids, and a nephew along the ride back from the beach and he showed us where they lived and such. I had a great time and would love to go back there for a week as well."
657573,Spouph,2012-01-18 00:52:00,115,"My parents stayed there on a little island a couple of years back they tried to get me to go they were baiting me with a bunch of fish pictures, they had some big ones,  what they were I don't know.  They said alot of big barricuda when snorkling, they also said they were fear less  the cuda would swim right up face to face.  I skype them once a week they are in mexico right now, but pm me if you want any additional info I could ask them but be specific, and I will do the best that I can.  They absolutly loved it there That I know.  enjoy your trip."

Pricing is $80/hr and includes all food, beer, soft drinks etc. Ny buddy Andrew is here in YK to work the ice road again this winter and he and his wife live in Roatan.  He uses Aaron to take clients for him when his boat is down."
657643,highdrifter,2012-01-18 03:48:00,2534,"Stayed in West Beach last year and spent the week chasing permit.  Great permit waters but a little deep for bones.  Good snorkeling, awesome party atmosphere too.  Ask for Greg at Sundowner's bar.  Good friend of mine and he's a hardcore permit fly fisherman.  Shoot me a pm if ya want.  cheers"
657656,solopaddler,2012-01-18 10:30:00,8605,    So go to Sundowners and ask for either Aaron or Greg LOL!  It's an incredibly small world.
657720,cityfisher,2012-01-18 15:34:00,959,Thanks Guys!! to the sundowner i go !!( not the one in niagara)
657721,BillM,2012-01-18 15:38:00,17367, You definitely don't wanna be fishing at the one on Lundys Lane
657724,HTHM,2012-01-18 15:43:00,4082,  It smells like fish there for some reason though.....
657949,Rattletrap2,2012-01-19 02:14:00,1652,"The place we liked best was a small restaurant named ""Beso's"". It is just down the road from Sundownwers right in Half Moon Bay. The snorkelling there was fantastic and there are some very reasonable places to stay there...including one owned by a couple from Quebec."
657957,DRIFTER_016,2012-01-19 02:54:00,10439,Make sure you pick up some of this while you're there. I've been told they have a 12 year old version as well.  
657973,highdrifter,2012-01-19 03:37:00,2534, So true..  It's a perfect spot!!
