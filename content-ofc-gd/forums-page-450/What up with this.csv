656819,aplumma,2012-01-15 18:01:00,6896,Brian go to this site and download ccleaner it will clear out any thing stuck in the memory. It will speed up your computer also without any danger to any programs. You also might reload your browser it may be corrupted. Go to delete programs and check to see if it has a repair option first.  I use both Firefox and Chrome to get into the internet with no issues. The Firefox uses a lot more memory than the Chrome and Chrome has a better plug-in setup than others.   Art
656895,GBW,2012-01-15 22:50:00,8460,it only does that to me on my laptop running IE9 and nothing else.
656896,misfish,2012-01-15 22:53:00,29133,Got it back. Not happy with the down load though.   Things were so much simplier back a year or two.
656898,GBW,2012-01-15 22:56:00,8460,I just gave up and wouldn't reply from my laptop.  so then I would have to get off my lazy   and go to my main home pc to read it and reply.  hence the lack of replies to PM's...
656899,Roy,2012-01-15 22:58:00,13728,"Brian, don't run Internet Exploder and you won't have that problem."
656901,Leecher,2012-01-15 23:01:00,7832," Which version??  You most likely not running the latest... I've only ever had issues when I upgraded to their latest and greatest  So now, running Google Chrome and don't have any issues anymore   and faster too  Until Firefox fixes their bugs... It's Google Chrome for me"

656779,Jer,2012-01-15 14:12:00,1426,"Started with me as soon as I upgraded to IE9. Roy was to look into it, but it's still the same, it won't allow you to pick from the drop-down menu on your profile link, just sends you to the profile immediately."
