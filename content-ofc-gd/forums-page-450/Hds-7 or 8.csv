656982,bucktail,2012-01-16 03:38:00,1857,Has anyone out here used both...... Stoty???  Going to pick up a 7 or a 8 this spring Gen2 that is. Wondering if the extra screen and short cut keys are worth the extra 600 bucks.  Any expierenced users I would love to hear from.  Darren
656997,Dan668,2012-01-16 10:37:00,1120,"Bought a 7, wish I got the 8. Will be getting the 8 in Feb when the rebates come out"
657024,Lunkerhunter,2012-01-16 14:00:00,455,danbob what makes you wish you got an 8?
657025,RickOnt,2012-01-16 14:07:00,669,Is it worth waiting to get the Gen2?
657027,BillM,2012-01-16 14:10:00,17367,You're getting a higher resolution with the 8 compared to the 7 (800x600 vs 640x480) also almost 2 more inches of screen size.  That's quite the bump!
657037,Dan668,2012-01-16 14:54:00,1120,"Screen size, if your using more than one feature (downscan, gps, structure scan), I find the 7 small after using it for the season  Gen 2 are out already I believe, I'm grabbing one, the structure scan being overlayed on the map looks awesome, easier to interpret too. If your buying an 8 and lss I believe the rebates will be 300, which is pretty good"
657055,bucktail,2012-01-16 15:55:00,1857,"Didnt realize there was a resolution difference, tha does make a big difference. I hink Gen 2's don come out  to march. They have to clear he invetory of older ones first.   Thanks guys  D"
657435,scugpg,2012-01-17 17:11:00,1373," Unless you are using structurescan, I think the Gen1 is the better choice at this point. Gen2 is noticeably faster but the Gen1 with the lastest update isn't as slow as it once was.  Depends on your upgrade plans too; maybe get a Gen1 for now, and move it to the bow when ready for a Gen2 for the main unit.  The big feature with Gen2 is the structuremap, at least so far. With the faster processor etc there may be more in store for this model down the road. But its like anything with new technology.  Gen2's are out in the US right now.  If I had to choose I would go for the 8, more screen real estate and access to quick buttons would be really nice. Split screen doesn't give a lot of room"
657453,I'mHooked,2012-01-17 18:16:00,525,I think I hear the sound of an HDS-10 calling your name...Shhhh...Do you hear it? 
657480,Gman,2012-01-17 19:54:00,126,"I have 2 HDS-8 gen1 units with no complaints, love'em! Love the hot keys to, otherwise you have to go thru the menu items each time in order to adjust colorline, sensitivity, frequency etc.  Had Joc from Angling Outfitters out to speak at our Straitline Anglers club back on January 3rd and he gave us his professional take on the new gen2 units.  I would recommend giving him a call to get his thoughts 519-935-5494. I think they're a little ""gimmicky"", if you want to spend the money on a new unit take a look at the Simrads, 20% fast and brighter.  Cheers G."
657493,scugpg,2012-01-17 20:18:00,1373," Yes and since they are also Navico, they look to work with structurescan and other Lowrance devices. They are up there in price but the cool factor is 100%. They most likely have similar hardware as the Gen2's, but with better screen resolution and a touchscreen. Not sure how nice the touchscreen would be on the water though  Simrad NSS"
657505,Dan668,2012-01-17 21:02:00,1120,"Why do you believe the gen 2 units are ""gimmicky"" ? Id like to know as i havent used them first hand."
657523,bucktail,2012-01-17 22:07:00,1857,"Gman just checked out that Simrad unit, pretty sweet. I really want the structure map as I do 2 big trips every year where there are no maps available. Have to find out if a discounted second Sirrius subscription can be one for the Unit. I measured y dash and the * will just fit on my swivel mount"
657829,archie_james_c,2012-01-18 20:04:00,618,"Shortcut keys, better split screens, dual memory card slots, and a bigger screen makes the 8 the clear winner. I own a 7 and my boss runs the 8 and I gun with him regularly and use his. I wish I bought the 8..."
