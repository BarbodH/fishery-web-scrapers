I'm not sure why, I just felt the need to jump full into the social media. http://ontariooutdooradventure.blogspot.com/  Does anyone else on OFC blog about topics, fishing or otherwise?  Good excuse to research topics that I find interesting and write about them. If nothing else I might expand a few into full articles and get back into outdoor writing.      For some reason the edit program will not let me type O F N. Changes to OFC."

654022,mpt,2012-01-06 17:48:00,158, I'm writing a blog for the local paper. No pay involved. They want me to write more and try to do it on the same days of the week. This supposedly generates more interest. My son told me to blog like a social media entry instead of me trying to write magazine articles all of the time. The articles are in my head but don't get on paper often enough. It's a constant juggling match with myself.
