657368,Moosebunk,2012-01-17 14:28:00,3970,"Great news Chris.  Heckuva time for you but it's good hearing you're on the mend and heading home.  More full days and nights ahead with your daughter, and steelhead just around the corner."
657374,Live2fish85,2012-01-17 14:46:00,1633,Thanks alot guys I appreciate it. I can't wait to sleep in my bed.
657377,mercman,2012-01-17 14:58:00,7054,"WTG Chris !!!!! go easy on yourself, and give yourself time to heal!!! Glad things are getting better Bud.   Paul"

657566,Skipper D,2012-01-18 00:35:00,1970,Take good care Chris
655310,Spiel,2012-01-10 18:22:00,9065," Ask for something stronger Chris, T3's are highly over rated as a pain med IMHO."
655311,fishnsled,2012-01-10 18:31:00,3520," X2  There has to be something they can give you to keep you comfortable. I'd be asking the doctor today what the plans are if you feel things are getting worst and when they are planning on doing something about it. Squeaky wheel....	It certainly sucks that you have the flu on top of this, but you'll be fine.  I'll keep a spot open in the boat for ya as well. Pm me when you are feeling up for it and we'll make something happen.  Speedy recovery!"
655328,Live2fish85,2012-01-10 19:23:00,1633,Thanks guys. I did getting somethibg stronger but even it doesn't last very long. I had a lung specailist come see me and she sent me for a CT so it should be to long before I figure this crap all out. I an sure happy I am in here now and the nurse I have today is so hot and actually listened to me. Took me telling 3 nurses the pain was so bad before they helped me. I don't know how some nurses have jobs still. I am in idolation and I have nurses come in with out aprons on and they don't clean there hands properly nothing kinda makes you wonder.
655352,aplumma,2012-01-10 20:23:00,6896,You can ask someone who visits to get a few bottles of hand sanitizer to keep in your room. It should help keeping the bugs down. Keep the faith and get well soon.   Art
655354,Live2fish85,2012-01-10 20:31:00,1633,Thank Art. As for the hand sanitizer there is lots of them around. I have one in my room and one in the hallway outside my room plus every ten feet there is another.
655363,mercman,2012-01-10 21:02:00,7054,  That stuffs pretty good mixed with ginger ale too !!!!!  JUST KIDDING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I sure hope you feel better soon Chris !!!
655370,Live2fish85,2012-01-10 21:36:00,1633,Well another quick update. They just got the results back to me and the pain is due to the blood and my ling is scaring they said I may have only 95% of ny lung function but they said it won't effect me. Also said that I should be able to play hockey and all the sports again.  So that is the best news I have heard in a while. I am also getting taking off the blood thinners to stop the bleeding but I will be in here for another week at least and the pain will last a few more days but they are keeping me on the narcotics they have me on.
655375,Spiel,2012-01-10 21:42:00,9065, All sounds very encouraging Chris. Get out of Iso and I'll come back for a proper visit!
656292,mercman,2012-01-13 16:05:00,7054,You awake now Chris?
657000,Live2fish85,2012-01-16 12:05:00,1633,Hey there all a quick update. Well I have been takin off the blood thinners finally and the blood had slowed down. I do still cough up some but not nearly as bad as I had it before. The pain in the lungs is not nearly as bad as it was for a few days there and I have stopped taking all the morphine and other pain meds. So in a sense it looks like things maybe turning around. I only need to get good enough in the docs eyes to get out. I have been in here for 12 days straight now and out of the last 20 days I have spent 17 of them in here lol. Not that I am complaining as people have it much worst. I also finally got to see my daughter yesterday which was the first time in awhile and all I can say was it was much needed nothing like getting that big hug and kiss from the most important thing in your life.
657002,Skipper D,2012-01-16 12:20:00,1970,"Well you wont get a hug and a kiss from me , but i am glad things are moving ahead a bit for you ."
657003,lew,2012-01-16 12:29:00,12766,Good news to hear your feeling better and I'll bet seeing your daughter after awhile had alot to do with it !!
657006,solopaddler,2012-01-16 12:34:00,8605,"Very glad to hear you had a visit from your daughter Chris!  Now work on getting yourself out of there.  Regarding our conversation last week, I have something waiting for you when you do get out.  Sometime in March when the rivers break up we'll get you out steelheading.  Cheers"
657007,Live2fish85,2012-01-16 12:35:00,1633,Thanks Ron and I am glad theres no kiss from you lol. The though are much appreciated though.  Lew you are a 100% right. She is just 2 and she ran in with a big smile and giggle. It sure made me feel great.
657013,Live2fish85,2012-01-16 12:51:00,1633,Thank you Solopaddler.
657014,mercman,2012-01-16 12:54:00,7054,"Nice to hear Chris !!! No one loves us like our kids, eh? Plus a bonus trip with Mike is really something to look forward to!!!! Keep on healing my friend!!!"
657017,Live2fish85,2012-01-16 13:02:00,1633,Thanks Paul you got that right. Kids are the best thing that is forsure.
657330,spincast,2012-01-17 10:39:00,3279,Good to hear you're on the road to recovery man. One more benefit for you and your lungs - by the time you get out of there you will have kicked the smoking habit. The trip with Solo will be a sweet way to bring in the new soft water season Take care and get better soon -
657336,Roy,2012-01-17 11:42:00,13728,"Hang tight, Chris. Do what the docs tell you to do and in no time you'll be out enjoying quality time with your daughter then that fantastic first fishing outing with her. Stay well."
657347,Skipper D,2012-01-17 13:00:00,1970,"Ok every one , i think he's ready for some hospital jokes..............."
657351,limeyangler,2012-01-17 13:20:00,5204,good to hear you are on the mend
657352,Live2fish85,2012-01-17 13:36:00,1633,Thanks guys. You have all made it all that much better while being in here. I finally got the best news yet and they are going to let me go today. I still have a long road to recovery and I will be back in a couple weeks for more test and CT scans and xrays but they think I will be better off at home with less chance of getting something. Plus a load of stress off. I can't wait to be able to sit on my couch and watch tv and to sleep in ny own big comfy bed but more then anything to see my daughter everyday and to give her a kiss goodnight again. I don't know how people can stay for so long in here I feel the pain I have been here two weeks straight and the only way I have got through is from my family and friebds being here all the time they could and also you folks here. Thank you to all who came and visited I truely appreciate it.  Now I need to work hard to be ready for my steelhead trip with solo. That is a goal for me lol.  Thanks a ton guys and gals.  Chris
657354,mike rousseau,2012-01-17 13:44:00,4661,Great news!!!!!
657355,lew,2012-01-17 13:45:00,12766,"Great news Chris, just don't overdo anything and do exactly what the doc tells you to do."
657363,solopaddler,2012-01-17 14:13:00,8605,Great new Chris.
654047,Harrison,2012-01-06 19:20:00,2202," Ha!  Two words, Angry Birds.  I am not a gamer in the least, but it is addicting."
654051,Live2fish85,2012-01-06 19:27:00,1633,I had it on my phone for awhile and I got bored of it. I do have 2 fishing games on my phone from the apps. One is a deep sea fishing and the other is a bass fishing.
654053,Skipper D,2012-01-06 19:31:00,1970, Your in the cardiac ward right ?
654057,Live2fish85,2012-01-06 19:51:00,1633,Yea I am. Got some off the best cariologist taking care of me.
654061,Skipper D,2012-01-06 20:06:00,1970,Have you run into a little blond haired nursey call Maranda ?
654065,Live2fish85,2012-01-06 20:16:00,1633,Umm I honestly don't remember there names very good. I do have and see lots of blonde nurses.
654075,Skipper D,2012-01-06 20:26:00,1970,"  If you do get her then i'll know your in perfect hands .... lol and if so tell her uncle Ron says Hi . Take care for now , i have to get back out to the shop and finish what i was doing , lunch break is over ."
654078,Gerritt,2012-01-06 20:36:00,6129,"If she is hot, and well built... get me her number  where about are you in the General... I am in that area regularly.."
654352,Live2fish85,2012-01-07 19:13:00,1633,Quick update. Talked to the Doctor today and they are still hoping that the  tear in the heart heals on its own but they also noticed that there ix a small blood clot in there to so they are keeping an eye on the clot and the tear. For now I got to just relax abd not walk around to much causing my heart to work to hard. One good thing is I got to watch a good hour of un-interupted fishing.
654358,mercman,2012-01-07 19:23:00,7054,well you better listen to the doctors or we wont get fishing together some day
654361,Live2fish85,2012-01-07 19:29:00,1633,I agree Paul. This summer when I am better I will come your way and stay at my sisters in Ottawa and we cab get out. I also want to get out with Mike to for some musky.
654364,Gerritt,2012-01-07 19:31:00,6129,where about are you in the General... I am in that area regularly.. and could pop in for a visit if you are up to it... are you allowed coffee? how do you take it? or I sneak in a couple beers LOL  G
654368,mercman,2012-01-07 19:47:00,7054,  We should book him together for a day.
654398,Skipper D,2012-01-07 21:44:00,1970,  x's 3 ......lol
654431,Live2fish85,2012-01-07 23:12:00,1633,We should do that.
654432,Live2fish85,2012-01-07 23:13:00,1633,Gerritt I am in the Cardiac Ward on the 4th floor
654442,Gerritt,2012-01-07 23:31:00,6129,"and I just wander the halls yelling ""Chris? Chrrrris!"" LOL  G"
654450,Pigeontroller,2012-01-07 23:46:00,2793,"Chris, consider yourself invited out for a day of Muskie fishing with me as well!"
654470,Live2fish85,2012-01-08 01:27:00,1633,That would be awesome to Pigeontroller. I would love to get put with you and learn some things.
654653,Live2fish85,2012-01-08 20:42:00,1633,Well quick update. When I thought I couldn't get worst I got the flu. This morning I woke up puking my brains out this morning. They tried giving me gravol through IV but it didn't work. After that they gave me meds that are givin to people on Chemo to keep them from getting sick.
654662,mercman,2012-01-08 21:02:00,7054,"Dang !! Its getting so hospitals are breeding grounds for virus and germs They closed most of the emergency wards down here cause of viral intestinitis and flu. Keep your spirits up Bud,"
654666,Live2fish85,2012-01-08 21:13:00,1633,Thanks Paul. Your correct about that to. The hospitals are breeding grounds for these viruses doesn't help either that stupid people come to the ER with the flu.
654675,mercman,2012-01-08 21:43:00,7054,"The wife and i are starting to get over a bad bronchial virus.We caught it when my nephew brought his sick kids over at Christmas. They are both in daycare.Walking snot factories The wife is hit harder than me, and she went to 2 clinics here this morning. Both are booked completely for the whole day. Seems everyone is sick with something or other."
654686,Live2fish85,2012-01-08 22:39:00,1633,Yea big time there is a ton of flu and viruses that are going around here. I can see going to the doctors with bronchitis and so on as it is a nasty cold. I have been there myself and those symptoms are worst then the flu.
655305,Live2fish85,2012-01-10 18:16:00,1633,I just want to update you all. Last night  I was having some real bad lung pains. The blood I am coughing up seems to be worst and the pain is so bad T3 arent even touching my pain.
653827,dheitzner,2012-01-06 02:09:00,314,"Tough break but as said, stay positive and work towards getting out on the soft stuff this spring; the fish will still be there. Hope that you're feeling better soon!"
653834,Jewelbee,2012-01-06 02:15:00,422,Hope your home with your family soon.
653872,Leecher,2012-01-06 03:15:00,7832,You're in good hands Chris    Get well soon
653894,woodenboater,2012-01-06 04:18:00,2277,Hopefully this is something they've seen before and that the course of action will have you out of there tout de suite ! Musky opener is still a few months away
653901,Live2fish85,2012-01-06 04:40:00,1633,Thanks guys. Yea it is something that they see the odd time. It is a complication from my surgery. They have me drugged up good right now trying to keep it all under control.  I can't wait for musky opener.
653905,Skipper D,2012-01-06 04:56:00,1970,"So with all of us posting to you , when do find the time rest .....lol"
653909,l2p,2012-01-06 05:55:00,346,keep ya head up bro!
653912,Skipper D,2012-01-06 06:26:00,1970,"  SHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh .. lol , i guess from the time i posted that one , till the time he replys again should give us our answer for that one ."
653916,Big Cliff,2012-01-06 09:34:00,6899,"Hope you get this all sorted out soon! Oh, and I'm always up early too so I'll gladly act as a back up chatter if you need me LOL."
653932,Live2fish85,2012-01-06 12:35:00,1633,Thanks Guys. Ron you are right. I actually got some sleep last night which is a surprise as the old guy next to me speaks no english but screams alot. They did a good job of sedating him though I would say.
653933,mercman,2012-01-06 12:43:00,7054,Marnin Chris So whats for breakfast today?
653935,Spiel,2012-01-06 12:57:00,9065,"Well Chris I've spent more time in the General in the last two years than I care to remember. But having done so I know your in good hands, you'll be just fine."
653939,corvette1,2012-01-06 13:04:00,1765,get well thats all that counts hopefully no surgery
653940,Live2fish85,2012-01-06 13:10:00,1633,Well Paul as I usually get Cheerios with  a brain muffin haha. That is until my wife gets here. She usually brings me a bagel or something. Seeing as I don't like milk lol.  Chris your right about that. The general is by far the best place to be. Much better then St. Joes or anything towards the falls. I have also been here more in the last two weeks then ever. Only time I was in a hospital longer was when I was a new born an I was in Sick Kids in toronto for awhile then moved to Mcmaster. Spent over a year of my first two years of life there. All I can say is thankfully we have OHIP and some amazing Doctors. Thankfully that isn't something I remember but will never forget.
653950,woodenboater,2012-01-06 13:53:00,2277,"OT and kinda doesn't really need an answer since it's obvious I 'spose, but hospitals now allow laptops in rooms ? R u using a stick ? I know they don't really stress mobile devices anymore unless one is in certain wards.  good luck and stop eyeing the nurses"
653952,Skipper D,2012-01-06 14:01:00,1970,"  Chris i was wanting to say , maybe it was because every one here posted the poup out ya yesterday ....... lol , and if so that was a good thing , heres to having your self a good day today ."
654000,Live2fish85,2012-01-06 16:10:00,1633,Thanks Ron. I hope to have a good day to. So far I have bad migraine and the man next to me acreams all the time. On top of that I can inly take tylenol which doesn't tend to help.
654002,Harrison,2012-01-06 16:15:00,2202,Get yourself better Bud.  The fishing sucks.  All the best.  Phil
654015,Live2fish85,2012-01-06 17:18:00,1633, Thanks Phil.  Like I always say. Any fishing is better then no fishing. I should bring my xbox and tv and just play my Bass Pro Shop fishing game lol.
654018,mercman,2012-01-06 17:40:00,7054,Maybe these will keep you busy for a while Chris http://www.worldfishingnetwork.com/fishing-games.aspx
654036,Live2fish85,2012-01-06 18:49:00,1633,Thank you Paul. Those should help kill some time.
654038,Skipper D,2012-01-06 18:53:00,1970,Are you up and about or do you have to stay still ?
654041,Live2fish85,2012-01-06 19:00:00,1633,I have to try and stay still. They want me to relax. The tear in the heart keeps bleeding and the more I push it the less hance it heel and then I need surgery.
654044,Skipper D,2012-01-06 19:10:00,1970,WICH HOSPITAL ARE YOU IN ?
654046,Live2fish85,2012-01-06 19:15:00,1633,I am in the Hamilton General.
653587,Live2fish85,2012-01-05 15:53:00,1633,Just thought I would let you all know it looks like the Hamilton General is going to be my home for awhile. I can't seem to stay away. Last night I was feeling some discomfort in my chest again and the feeling like my lungs were filling with mucus and when I coughed it was blood. The doctors say it is a complication from the surgery and my valve is bleeding into my lungs.
653593,Nipfisher,2012-01-05 16:11:00,2449,Hoping you get better soon. Hosp. is the best place for you now. Don't take any chances.
653605,tb4me,2012-01-05 16:29:00,3295,"Oh thats not good..Wow, get as comfy as you can..You are better off in hospital. Get well soon.."
653613,Rod Caster,2012-01-05 16:48:00,5784,Best of luck... hopefully we post some interesting topics to give you some good reading.  
653615,mercman,2012-01-05 16:51:00,7054,dang !!! keep ust up to date Bud.
653617,Live2fish85,2012-01-05 17:00:00,1633,Thanks guys. I will keep you up dated and Chad I hope so to. An it is forsure the best place for me and it is a great hospital. Thankfully we have no ice or this would be even harder to sit in here.
653620,mike rousseau,2012-01-05 17:10:00,4661,You need to chat I'm a stay at home dad...  I got loads of time to talk fishing to keep your mind on the good stuff...  PMs welcome...
653621,lew,2012-01-05 17:10:00,12766,Sorry to hear about your set-back and hopefully they get everything straightened out soon.
653622,limeyangler,2012-01-05 17:14:00,5204,get well soon dude....like the others said...best place to be.
653624,Live2fish85,2012-01-05 17:21:00,1633,Thanks guys I appreciate it. Mike I may take you up on that.  Isn't a stay at home dad the best job. Since my heart messed up in April that is what I have been doing and I love it. It will be nice to get out so I can actually see my daughter for more then a day.
653653,mike rousseau,2012-01-05 18:49:00,4661, I can imagine...  It is a great job to have... I wish I could trade places with my girlfriend tho... Due to our situation I had to take the stay at home job... And she had to go back to work... Almost immediately...  But I was able to fish an awful lot...  : )
653654,Joey,2012-01-05 18:51:00,9122,"Wow, that's tough, sorry to hear that.  Hope you feel better soon and they get this all cleared up for you.  Joey"
653661,uglyfish,2012-01-05 19:22:00,981,all the best chris! hurry up and heal up so we can get out fishing!
653665,aplumma,2012-01-05 19:33:00,6896,Aww shoot man that's to bad on the setback. I'm glad to hear you are getting the help needed to get back on your feet though.    Art
653701,Live2fish85,2012-01-05 21:28:00,1633,Thanks a ton everyone. I hope that this is figured out soon.  Darryl I hope so to all I can say is I hope it doesn't take another surgery to fix it all that will mean is longer recovery and with my wife about to pop out our second I need to get back to work.  That was the other bonus for me Mike as well I got to fish alot more and spend lots of time with my daughter. I would have much rather been working though rather then no income as our government is mental.
653731,spincast,2012-01-05 22:39:00,3279,Hey Chris - sorry to hear about the set back. I'm sure they'll have you all sewn up and ready to change dirty diapers in no time though bud. Take care of yourself first - then you can take care of the family.
653737,bushart,2012-01-05 22:57:00,2628,Take care Buddy
653756,Live2fish85,2012-01-06 00:07:00,1633,"Thanks guys a quick update, I was told that the CT Scan showed I have bleeding from my heart that is going into my lungs. For now they are putting me on meds to try and stop the bleeding. Hopefully it works."
653759,NAW,2012-01-06 00:11:00,4022,Good luck man.  I hope they get all of this figured out.  I hope you're out of the hospital before safe ice!
653767,Skipper D,2012-01-06 00:28:00,1970,"Hey Chris , from now on i am gona call you Mr Timex ...lol , only you know why i can talk to you this way while  others wont ... if your up in the midlle of the night and i am as well i'll let you know in the status box and we can chat , your in good hands  and i am rooting for ya ..........
