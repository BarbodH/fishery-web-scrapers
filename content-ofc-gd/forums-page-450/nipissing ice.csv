657895,kickingfrog,2012-01-18 23:06:00,8333,My concern is the snow that has now fallen on the ice and the resulting slush possibility.
657921,Nipfisher,2012-01-19 00:17:00,2449,  P.M.d you.   My guess is that slushy areas got worse...but they are avoidable.   I didn't get out today but will be at the hut tomorrow. I can update you then.

657956,kickingfrog,2012-01-19 02:45:00,8333,Thank guys. My brother has changed his mind/schedule. Now that there is two of us we've booked a day hut.
