656858,lxt,2012-01-15 20:21:00,7,"hey guys, new member to the site, just wondering if anyone has been out on cooks bay this season and if so how is the ice condition/ water depth and what type of fish are in there, any help would be great  thanks guys."
656863,northernpike56,2012-01-15 20:49:00,717,"probably not much ice up there but i really have no clue. the main species people target there is perch but there are also probably some sunfish, crappies, and pike kicking around as well."
656874,Woodsman,2012-01-15 21:27:00,1286,"I was out there yesterday on Cooks Bay. Much of the rest of the lake is not safe yet. 3 1/2"" of solid very hard ice. Lots of noise as it was making ice all day & with last nights cold I would guess it would have added close to an other inch +. Fished straight out from Gilford in 13 1/2 fow & the bite was non-stop. For the day myself & a buddy must of caught close to 500 perch. Most in the 6""- 8"" range with a few bigger ones including a 13 1/2"" one George got. Yesterday it didn't matter what you threw at them as they hit everything we tried. I mostly stayed with different jigs as minnows were not needed & I didn't have to keep re-baiting. We both brought enough of the larger ones home for a good meal. We also caught about 5 herring each all between 14""- 16"". Don't confuse these with whitefish as the season for herring is closed on Simcoe.  Best Wishes: Rick"

656942,Freshtrax,2012-01-16 00:34:00,2215,I was out today. I caught some tank perch. 10 over ten inches with the biggest at 13.  And about 150 under ten inches went back down the hole.  I wouldent venture further north than gillford. Lefroy was open water yesterday @4pm. Today @ 4pm its 1/2 inch of ice as far as the eye can see out into the main lake basin.
656943,BillM,2012-01-16 00:35:00,17367,"Man, that's way to dicey for me..  I'll wait till Feb, lol... Be careful out there boys!"
656944,Freshtrax,2012-01-16 00:38:00,2215,I was on 5inches 1km due east of gillford rd today bill.  She was really noisy today. Felt like earthquakes going on all day.
656946,BillM,2012-01-16 00:47:00,17367,5inches isn't bad at all..  I fished on  just over 3inches early last year on the north side of the lake....  You never get used to that noise
656948,Rizzo,2012-01-16 01:12:00,4754,"I was out front of southshore centre a couple of years back doing the charity event on Kempenfelt Bay when the loudest rumble I ever heard went through. All 867 people with me let out a big gasp, and then a whole bunch of laughter"
656986,Locnar,2012-01-16 04:20:00,645,"Hmmm, still seems to risky for me... maybe in a week or two. Anyone happen to know if Canal has any ice on it yet?"
656990,Freshtrax,2012-01-16 05:51:00,2215,Its all about comfort and if your not a local or familliar with the lake and icepatterns i cant blame you.... My rule  rule of thumb for snowmachines is six inches.  And foot travel is min is 3 with 4 bieng exponentialy more comfortable.  No idea on the canal sorry.  Whatever you do do not go much north of hwy 89
656999,turtle,2012-01-16 11:59:00,274,"Anyone happen to know if Canal has any ice on it yet?   I walked on Canal Saturday to check ice but didnt fish it.  6-10 inches of ice on the n-w side of the lake, going east toward the causeway/island less.  The depth where I checked was 4 FOW or less. On Friday there was alot of open water in the current areas near the causeway and along the channel, much closed up by Sunday."
657004,12footspringbok,2012-01-16 12:31:00,459,I was out yesterday with a friend. Think we were the farthest north in about 30 fow. A good 4 inches of ice and lots of perch. The ice was awful noisy until about 11am. That one wave that came through at about 10:30am and shifted the ice about 2-3 feet was a little nerve racking LOL...   Good to be back on simcoe.
657047,cityfisher,2012-01-16 15:23:00,959,went out the keswick side yesterday... didnt go to far out... around 8 feet...bunch of dink perch... none of any size.. marked 6 inches in one spot

Is there any public access up that way? The only public access I know is on Centennial Park rd. You think the little deep pockets are frozen over enough?"
657076,J-M,2012-01-16 17:10:00,65," Oh yah, I remember that. I've been icefishing for a number of years now and that was by far the loudest rumble - not only that, it felt like the ice dropped about half a foot and came back up. It was crazy. I remember the fishing completely died off after that!"
657100,turtle,2012-01-16 19:16:00,274,Is there any public access up that way? The only public access I know is on Centennial Park rd. You think the little deep pockets are frozen over enough?   I was at a rental cottage there and dont really know the lake or access points.  That's why I was out testing ice.  Closer to the causeway and current areas was open on Friday so there wouldnt be much ice where it did freeze over.
657289,Marko,2012-01-17 02:34:00,854,I plan on going ice fishing for the first time in my life in a week or two......im gonna soil myself if i hear ice making that noise LOl
657290,kickingfrog,2012-01-17 02:47:00,8333, Better have some diapers.
657291,irishfield,2012-01-17 02:53:00,26272,Terry has some spare.. slightly used.. underwear from Sunday if you're interested! LOL
