654800,wormdunker,2012-01-09 10:07:00,1711,"Does any one know how I could paint my gear storage box with camo colors?  Is there a decal/stick on type of material I could use?  I just bought a new ATV that is green & tried to match a green paint for my storage box with no success.  I thought of buying brown, green, black, tan paints in small cans & & just start painting with different size brushes on the box.  Any input is greatly appreciated.  Thanx Wormdunker"
654808,Roy,2012-01-09 11:45:00,13728,"If you really want it camo, don't use a brush. If you were proficient with an airbrush you could use that but the easiest is with rattle cans. Using four colours. This kid's example will give you the idea.   <iframe width=""480"" height=""360"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/6q6D7Njvedo"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>"
654810,lew,2012-01-09 11:55:00,12766,If that kid ever leans his gun against a tree he'll never find it again
654811,Billy Bob,2012-01-09 12:40:00,5865,"I have used cheap spray paint to camo several things....look for flat colors (not glossy paint)....the three colors I like to use are flat black, red primer and  flat green. A fourth color could be gray primer. Only problem now is I can't find the stuff I camo'd....LOL"
654858,Djeep,2012-01-09 14:59:00,199,"Camo duck tape can be found at some places. ct in lindsay has it in the hunting section. cheap, easy alternative."
654874,bassjnkie,2012-01-09 15:32:00,1101,I know some companies like Yamaha have camo kits for their quads. Or search eBay for camo vinyl rolls.
654896,richyb,2012-01-09 16:17:00,774,walmart has paint marked camoflauge. Theres a couple different browns and greens and greys that are flat to use as camo. I have seen people paint something then place a maple leaf on it then spray over that with a different colour.

655535,Sinker,2012-01-11 05:40:00,8692,"If your painting plastic.....or anything for that matter.....look for the Krylon ultra flat spray cans. Its good stuff, and sticks to anything really good.

655694,Harrison,2012-01-11 20:52:00,2202, I would contact someone who wraps truck or boats.  They may have some scrap pieces laying around to do your box.
