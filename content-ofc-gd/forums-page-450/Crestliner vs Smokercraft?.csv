657125,Roy,2012-01-16 20:38:00,13728," I don't doubt that you could buy the welded hull and have a super boat, Mike. But something to consider is that should you have a hull problem while up there with the wife and kids on your yearly vacation, it'd be a snap to repair a few rivets as opposed to a cracked hull. You at least would not have lost you and your family's vacation time."
657126,irishfield,2012-01-16 20:39:00,26272,  I know some guy that could even be talked into flying in with parts and tools.... for a steak and a beer!!
657128,Roy,2012-01-16 20:42:00,13728,I would have added that to my post but you told me not to say anything!
657130,irishfield,2012-01-16 20:47:00,26272,LOL Roy.. I even have the coordinates in my flight bag. Guess Mike was preplanning....
657131,HTHM,2012-01-16 20:49:00,4082,Forget both of those boats and buy my Ranger.....
657144,solopaddler,2012-01-16 21:37:00,8605,"The first hand feedback from you guys has been appreciated. I'm still talking with both guys though, nothing's been done yet.  Thanks again!       If something like that happened when I was there I have at least 3 other boats that belong to friends at my disposal, so no big deal.   Assuming you have a normal summer this year with no unexpected tragedies I expect to see you at some point. Always have steaks in the fridge.     Not the style of boat I need buddy."
656506,Billy Bob,2012-01-14 13:11:00,5865,"Both are ""sub""-par boat......get yourself a good GRUMMAN and be done with it.....only boat manufacture the makes both boats and planes so everyone here should be happy....  BTW it's a well know fact that Grumman owners at the best fishermen....so you may or may not qualify....LOL  Bob"
656511,danbouck,2012-01-14 13:39:00,4380, Just saying
656516,Grimace,2012-01-14 14:12:00,2020,"I am on my third welded hull.  The first two cracked.  The manufacturer (not Crestliner) and dealer I bought from were incredible.  They gave me a new hull twice.  The 2006 hull cracked, they gave me  2008 hull.  It cracked, they gave me a 2010 hull.  It seems so far that this one is holding up.  Two seasons under it and dry as a bone.   It better be anyway because the manufacturer has changed the transoms starting in the 2011 line-up and I would have to buy a long shaft to fit on it.    They have pretty much said that this is the last one their giving me.  Just for the record none of the cracks have been my fault.  I would feel much better right now if my boat was threatening to pop a rivet or two, then I could just replace them.   At least I didn't buy a Cracker, I would still be stuck with the leaking hull and they would blame me for 'rough trailering'.  Either way, I hope you really enjoy your new boat.  I will never forget how excited I was to buy mine."
656519,Sinker,2012-01-14 14:20:00,8692,"  What was the cause of the riveted hull splitting?? I've never heard of a split riveted hull before, so this is interesting to me.  And please don't say they ran it aground, or hit a shoal, or dropped it off the trailer. That doesn't count!  S."
656521,Sinker,2012-01-14 14:27:00,8692," What kind of boat is this?? I'd sell it and move on. How long have you had this 3rd hull? Good lord, I'd be afraid to take that boat anywhere!! Get rid of it while you can, and get something riveted. I don't know of a single welded hull with no broken welds. There is always a weld busted somewhere, whether its minor or major. It only needs to let go once and your sunk. These things tend to happen very quick, and always when you least expect it. I'd rather have a leaky riveted hull myself.  I""m not into buying things that are known to break. Who cares if you get good service from the dealer, I want a boat that's going to last me, and not fall apart. How long were you out of a boat while waiting for the new one(s)?? That's crazy, I'd be fighting for a full refund the second time around.  What if you were out with your family, and the hull split open, and the boat sunk?? What then?? Do you think the dealer would compensate you for the death of your family?? I don't. Get rid of it for your own safety at the very least.    S."
656523,Grimace,2012-01-14 14:37:00,2020,If I could do it over again I would buy a riveted hull.   Unfortunately I can't do it over again.
656527,Muskieman,2012-01-14 14:55:00,2472,If it matters I have a 12 yr old RIVETED Tracker and I pound the snot out of it..... Still dry as a bone.    I agree that ALL welded hulls are prone to cracking... not just the Trackers.  Randy
656528,walleyemen,2012-01-14 14:56:00,316,"Daves had great service from his manufature, 3 new boats is amazing service, and i can personally atest that he very much so takes great care of his boat, i owned a tracker and lost my shirt and was forced to buy something else, which i might add am very happy with!good luck on your purchase and yes i""ll be the first to say if you can afford it ""buy a lund""!!!!"
656558,Cookslav,2012-01-14 17:48:00,1457," My boat ain't pretty, but it is a 1967 starcraft Falcon...just repaired 3 rivets this year for the fist time. I'd call 45 years of functionality a pretty good track record I suppose"
656569,Radnine,2012-01-14 19:20:00,1538,I wish that I had bought a Lund just so I didn't have to continuously defend buying a Crestliner. Sometimes being an innovative trend-setting border-pushing industry leader is more than one can bear. Crestliner must feel the same way Jim
656571,BillM,2012-01-14 19:22:00,17367,"Mike, I don't think you can make a bad choice either way.."
656575,esoxansteel,2012-01-14 19:46:00,1307,"The lines on a welded boat look nicer Mike, but ill take the dependablity of a riveted hull anyday, My 1993 Tracker Deep V 17 is riveted and has never leaked, or had a loose or popped rivet.  "
656587,fishnsled,2012-01-14 20:22:00,3520," x2  I've had my Crestliner for 10 years now and would buy another tomorrow. It gets used pretty much every weekend from April to December on smaller lakes to Lake Ontario. Is it a perfect boat, no. I'd change the lay out and will most likely do that when the time comes to change the floor. For my needs and my budget at the time, it was the best bang for the buck I could find."
656590,lew,2012-01-14 20:38:00,12766,I drove a Crestliner for 8 or 9 years and it was an excellent boat. Sold it to a friend who's had it for 3 years now and it's still an excellent boat.  I'm on the water more than most folks and never had an issue with it.  I know a few others with Crestliners and their all happy with theirs too.  Never owned a Smokercraft but have fished out of a couple and they seem like good boats too.
656738,Bernie,2012-01-15 05:44:00,3190,We have sold the Crestliner for several years now and have not had one back for a hull crack that we have sold.  We did get one in that had been sold elsewhere and was obviously abused but it was still looked after by Crestliner.  A very good company to deal with.
656763,solopaddler,2012-01-15 12:41:00,8605,Thanks a bunch guys. You havn't made my decision any easier LOL!  I'm leaning towards the Smokercraft at this point but will still consider the Crestliner if the price is substantially lower.  Both guys are currently at the boat show looking to upgrade to something bigger. I suspect one or both may be motivated to sell fairly soon.
656788,moparhawk,2012-01-15 15:05:00,146,"Maybe the best part is you can't make a bad decision between them. I will say this for my riveted Smokercraft Promag.(98) When it was a couple years old I hit one of those stumps about 8"" under water and damaged the bottom of the boat. Took it in for repairs and they had to remove the interior and replace a bunch of rivets and repaint. Its been like 8 or 9 yrs since and not a drop leaks in. It did cost the insurance co over $3000.00 dollars but thats why you buy insurance. A welded boat would of been a complete loss."
656793,bigbuck,2012-01-15 15:31:00,2449,"Which one has the better layout and rigging for your needs?? They are both great boats, they both are well built. Also, which works better for your wallet?? With 60hp 4strokes, they will be miserly with fuel. Whichever boat you decide on, enjoy it!!!"
656795,Billy Bob,2012-01-15 15:46:00,5865," OK,  you dangled the carrot out in front of us saying the great service this manufacture supplied to you....SO WHO BUILT THIS BOAT AND STOOD BEHIND IT SO WELL  ?!?!?!?...after all you did say it NOT a Tracker Boat....enquiring anglers want to know...."
656799,Grimace,2012-01-15 16:06:00,2020,"Lowe. Awesome boat.  The layout is impeccable.  It cuts water brilliantly.  It's sharp looking.   It's really nice and wide compared to the other aluminums (just like the crestliner). The dealer I bought it from was fantastic.  Having said all of that, it is still gut wrenching thinking about how two hulls got cracks.  Anyways, good luck with your choice Mike.  Smokercraft and Crestliner are both quality boats. I would take the riveted hull with all other things being equal."
656801,Billy Bob,2012-01-15 16:11:00,5865, I always like the Lowe boats but I never knew they were welded hulls....are all their hulls welded or just some of the newer models ???
656803,Grimace,2012-01-15 16:22:00,2020,I think all of them.
656821,fishdawg,2012-01-15 18:07:00,912,"I have a 16' '04 Crestliner Canadian tiller. Original owner.  Doing some renos/additions and a complete clean-up to it this winter. At the same time Ive pulled up all my floorboards to have a peak at the hull 'et all. I'd say its all in 90% great shape. No wet foam, marine plywood is great, as is the transom. The only blemish Ive got are 3 broken support welds that hold up one of the side platforms.  Ive been very happy with the boat the last 8 seasons. i pretty much use it 9-11 months of the year. Mostly now on Lakes Erie & Ontario and the Niagara river. Its been through a lot of various conditions and weather but its holding up well. Its also stored indoors when not in use.  The dealer i used was Proctor marine in Simcoe (Hwy 3). Very pleasent dealing with them & thankfully havent had to go back yet."
657081,brw,2012-01-16 17:24:00,101,"Solo: If all else is considered equal between the 2 boats, I would consider the one with the wider beam. Like you, I have 2 kids and the wider beam makes a difference when you have 3 in the boat. my lund has a 95 in beam and many of my fellow hard core fisherman who also have boats remark at how much they like the wider beam. even a few inches seems to make a difference. Food for thought. Nice problem to have!!!"
657101,Fish4Eyes,2012-01-16 19:17:00,1022,"Given that young children will be in the boat Mike, I would not even think twice and get the riveted hull."
656452,solopaddler,2012-01-14 01:29:00,8605,"Hey guys, I've been looking at boats for a while now and am pretty close to pulling the trigger on one.  I've been looking for a 16-17' aluminum deep V with a full windshield, stand up top and a 50-90 horse 4 stroke.  It's going to be used at our water access camp in QC.  Anyhow I've got it narrowed down to either a Crestliner or a Smokercraft. Both were bought new in '06. Both seem very well taken care of, both have 60 horse 4 stroke Merc's and the price on each is pretty close.  In your opinion which is a better boat? I'm partial to the Cresliner with its welded hull but the Smokercraft is pretty highly regarded as well.  I'm having a hard time deciding and need a nudge eith way LOL!"
656454,Rizzo,2012-01-14 01:31:00,4754,whichever one is not a tiller
656455,irishfield,2012-01-14 01:32:00,26272,"Well I'd take the riveted over the welded 9 times out of 10, but you knew that already..... but which ever boat has the layout that you like the most is the way I'd head...  In either case... the kids won't be happy with 60Hp when they decide they'd like to wakeboard!"

656466,solopaddler,2012-01-14 02:15:00,8605,Thanks for the input everyone!     The layout in both is almost identical.  Why don't you like welded hulls Wayne?
656467,Pigeontroller,2012-01-14 02:17:00,2793,There's a reason they rivet Aircraft fusilages(sp?)
656472,Raf,2012-01-14 02:33:00,3495,The one with the yamaha.. ohh wait.  They're both fine boats.  Sorry it's not much help.
656474,DRIFTER_016,2012-01-14 02:46:00,10439,  The metal around the welded area is weakend by welding and if the welder uses too much heat it is more prone to cracking. Replacing a popped rivet is less of a problem than having the boat welded back up.
656477,bushart,2012-01-14 03:34:00,2628,I've had excellent service from my Smoker

656479,dave524,2012-01-14 03:40:00,4508," Saw a buddy have that problem with one of the early Crestliner weldeds, maybe 1990, started cracking immediately adjacent to the welds in several spots. Didn't get any satisfaction from the dealer, said he ran it too hard in rough water which was possibly true to some extent. Luckily he was a welder at a steel mill with lots of tickets and repaired it at work on weekend and sold it to a duck hunter with full disclosure of the problem. Since then welded boats scare me"
656481,Stef,2012-01-14 03:50:00,63,"I've owned both Smoker and Crestliner hulls over my life, my last 2 boats have both been Crestliner and both with the 60hp 4-stroke.  I don't think there is a lot of difference in quality in either, they are both good.  Consider the width of the boat, wider at the transom will support the weight of a 4-stroke better (even though the 60 is pretty light as far as it goes) and get on plane quickly and a reverse chine is a benefit that will give a nice dry ride.  I'd look for this over rivet/weld differences, both boats are probably lifetime hull warranty anyway.  Motor condition may be a factor, engine hours are maintained by the engine and can be read by a dealer.  Prop/skeg  condition may be telling.  If they both come out equal, what colour do you like better?"
656482,irishfield,2012-01-14 03:59:00,26272," Provided that Crestliner isn't providing the same USELESS lifetime warranty that Tracker does when it comes to guaranteing (sp) their ""welded hulls"". Tracker only guarantees the weld it self.. so when it cracks right beside it (where ANY weld does aluminum or steel) they tell you to go pound salt.  Mike.. Dave covered my reply... welding weakens the material beside the weld, and there is no way of knowing it happened, well..until it cracks open. Lew had a GREAT life out of his Crestliner and now Jim and the boys are enjoying it as well. Haven't heard any real horror stories on Crestliners but I could write a book on Trackers.. so maybe Crestliner/Brunswick have put a little more thought into how things are formed, welded and where things are braced to take the loads.  Welding of aluminum itself... I have no issues on things OVER .100 thickness.. like Stanley's with nothing thinner than .125 in their construction.  BTW.. we're riveting boats in Temagami.. starting next week !"
656483,Radnine,2012-01-14 04:02:00,1538," Yes, because they don't have to be waterproof. Jim"
656484,irishfield,2012-01-14 04:05:00,26272,"  Say what? There's 13,500 rivets in my floats (that don't leak)... and they also pressurize the ""aluminum tubes"" that soar thru the skies at 36,000 feet you know! Those pressurization cycles are harder on things than any lake pounding will give."
656485,Radnine,2012-01-14 04:13:00,1538,"I am fine eating food with two sticks, why would I try a fork? I am fine with a typewriter, why would I want a word processor?

Crestliner all the way!! or Smokercraft. Who really cares (for the amount you are likely to use it)? But to buy a riveted boat just because that is all that 9 out of 10 people have ever known is wrong. A riveted boat will leak if you keep it long enough, your welded boat will leak if there is a factory defect. Over. Jim"
