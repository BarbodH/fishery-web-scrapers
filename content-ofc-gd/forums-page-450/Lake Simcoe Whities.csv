653383,uglyfish,2012-01-04 23:49:00,981,"great video aaron, im dying to try for some whities on simcoe! if ya ever want a tag along, id love to spend a day with u on the ice learning how to get them whities!!"
653397,danbouck,2012-01-05 00:46:00,4380,Just put it on the tv and loved it. Great job
653400,Rod Caster,2012-01-05 00:51:00,5784,I like the tip ups.. not to fancy but very functional! That auger cuts like butter! Mine used to cut like that but it's been beaten up quite bad...time for a new FinBore. Great video... makes me feel like I'm there with you guys.  
653454,limeyangler,2012-01-05 03:47:00,5204,Great vid Aaron...i'm heading out Saturday for my first whitie outing this year...hopefully we get on 'em like you did.
653899,Bassnbows,2012-01-06 04:36:00,58,Very Nice. Is it that time yet.
653978,SirCranksalot,2012-01-06 15:24:00,3291,"Nice video, Aaron!  I watch very little TV---do you have a show on TV somewhere?"
654023,Spiel,2012-01-06 17:49:00,9065,Good stuff Aaron and Tony.  I'm pretty sure the last time I ice fished whities was with you (Aaron) and Don and all I could manage was Lakers.
656814,Toad Hunter,2012-01-15 17:27:00,261,"nice video Aaron ! I've actually followed your stuff for a while now, I really enjoy that you still manage to get excited over fish, no matter the size or species, unlike a lot of the other shows on WFN, most of the hosts seem to have a ""oh another one..."" kind of attitude. my gf Natacia works with your buddy Tony, and she thought it was cool when I told her that you've actually filmed on ""our"" lake (Kashagawigamog) - I look forward to taking her out on the water for some ""real"" fishing, compaired to Puslinch or the Grand, and hope to nab her (or my self) a couple skis  (quick question if you don't mind, when you guys were filming, were you more towards the NE end of the lake ?)"
656959,Rizzo,2012-01-16 01:41:00,4754,that was a great watch. Nicely done guys
656994,Freshtrax,2012-01-16 06:52:00,2215,Hey i built one of your tipups last nightits really fun to watch it bounce i had so much fun handinining perch on cooks today with it .....its bin a while and i landed atleast a hundred fish so i have lots of practice for the big lake
656995,Freshtrax,2012-01-16 06:54:00,2215,Ps. The mainlake skimmed today.
657029,BillM,2012-01-16 14:12:00,17367, 4 degrees tomorrow and 25k winds.   Say goodbye to that ice!  LOL!!!   We should make a pool as to when we are going to get out on the main lake.
657034,DoubleDigits,2012-01-16 14:45:00,140," The 14 day outlook looks pretty terrible. Looks like my new lx5, pop-up, heater, boots and lures will have to wait it out a little while longer..."
657292,Aaron Shirley,2012-01-17 02:54:00,655,"Hey, thanks again everyone. I do enjoy fishing combined with video production. Glad you enjoyed it!  Knuguy, I am not on TV. I post videos to my YouTube channel as a hobby only.  Toad Hunter, you hit the nail on the head. They are there in the fall. Summer is a different story.  Hey Speil, I remember that day. We all got our butts kicked by that old guy that walked out 3 miles, fished for a half hour, then walked all the way back in with his limit lol. He caught more fish in a half hour than we did all day! That was amazing to watch how he jigged them with a rod in each hand so differently.  What's also amazing, is that I can remeber such fine details from a fishing trip from years back, but I can't for the life of me remember what my wife told me yesterday!"
657308,bigugli,2012-01-17 04:16:00,6138,"Baked whitefish is really quite simple. Scaled and gutted fish with a belly slit. We love stuffing that mixes dried bread chunks, crab/ shrimp, a diced onion and melted butter . A spice mix of salt, pepper, sage and savory. Blend it and fill the cavity, then sew it up. Rub a little butter, salt and lemon juice on the body, and wrap in tinfoil."
657315,vinnimon,2012-01-17 04:30:00,2593,"nice shooting aaron  Shoot, I remember that day  First time ive had the corlions to drive where ever on the ice"
652814,Aaron Shirley,2012-01-03 03:10:00,655,Here is a Simcoe whitie vid I did with TonyB for you to watch while waiting for the ice to firm up   Or you could just take out a boat haha. Enjoy.  Simcoe Whities
652816,kickingfrog,2012-01-03 03:18:00,8333,Premature posting?  I see no video?
652828,DRIFTER_016,2012-01-03 03:55:00,10439,"Yep, me thinks you forgot sumpin' Aaron."
652829,Aaron Shirley,2012-01-03 03:59:00,655,"LOL, sorry, forgot to add the link!  It's there now"
652837,Roy,2012-01-03 05:13:00,13728,"Absolutely epic video, Aaron and Tony. Lots of action, lots of tips, two smiling faces and a whole lot of fun. I thoroughly enjoyed all of it and hope I can get to see more.  Both of you, be well.  ps. That cameraman of yours is no slouch either."
652839,OutdoorDan,2012-01-03 05:48:00,325,"This is such a great video, Aaron.  Very professionally done and extremely informative!  Thank you for posting this."
652860,12footspringbok,2012-01-03 12:00:00,459,I remember a day towards the end of the season last year where someone had a hard time keeping those whities hooked up....  Soon enough we will be on Simcoe.  Till then I'll have to keep going a little further north.
652861,Terry,2012-01-03 12:15:00,14456,nice video  like I wasn't itching enough to get into some whities  now even more
652873,BillM,2012-01-03 14:42:00,17367,TonyB is a superstar!   Nice job boys!
652874,Harrison,2012-01-03 14:44:00,2202,Mint!  Well Done.
652889,Jds63,2012-01-03 15:10:00,1365,Great video and lots of excellent tips ... thanks Aaron and Tony
652957,Aaron Shirley,2012-01-03 20:44:00,655,"Thanks for the kind words guys. It was a fun day.  LOL Terry. I've been putting that video together in my spare time after my kids go to bed for 2 months. Now there is no ice to get out for whities! To make matters worse, I got a new Frabill Trekker Shuttle for Xmas and I have to wait to try it out. Good thing I also fish the Niagara in the winter"
652959,COUNTRYBOY,2012-01-03 20:52:00,130,GREAT VIDEO...I WISH THAT WAS SOMETHING YOU SHOT YESTERDAY...DAMN WEATHER
652962,EC1,2012-01-03 21:10:00,930,"Thanks for sharing! Was great to see how other people do it, since I get rejected almost everytime by the whitefish.  Your show should definitely be on TV instead of some of those other ones out there. Shows that show nothing about presentation and clips begin the moment fish are hooked up are absolutely junk."
652969,esoxansteel,2012-01-03 21:19:00,1307,"   Absolutely agree, I cant believe some of the so called fishing shows that make it on TV"
653133,OutdoorDan,2012-01-04 04:15:00,325, This for sure.  Your video had so much useful tips and information.  The stuff on TV is just blatant product placement and advertising.  This is on top of the fact that you were nailing fish on a lake that is accessible to everyone whereas many fishing shows are done in remote locations where anyone can catch fish.
653176,Billy Bob,2012-01-04 11:22:00,5865," I can't agree more.... your video not only is entertaining but also very educational....that was something that years ago the In-Fishermen shows were famous for....now almost all shows on TV bore me with their product pushing bull....Keep up the nice work...  On a different note I REALLY enjoy smoked whitefish and consider them the BEST that can be had....however, I have heard that they are a great baking fish, although I never had them this way....I would like to hear how you guys cook them other then smoking as I always considered them a very oily fish that made them great for smoking."
653258,adempsey,2012-01-04 18:13:00,1498,Thanks for the video!  Can't wait to get out there.   Loved seeing the HDS in action on the ice.   Makes me wonder if I should change over from a flasher.  I might even try using a Rapala jig for whitefish this season. I usually stick with the other horizontal jigs and Williams spoons.  Nice DIY tip-up (or is it a tip-down?) as well.  Cheers!
653293,mike rousseau,2012-01-04 19:52:00,4661,Looks like a blast...  Never caught a whitey or a laker...  I smell a trip...
653312,tb4me,2012-01-04 21:05:00,3295,Great show Aaron! Loved  it..thanks!
653338,MJIG,2012-01-04 22:04:00,227,That was a really great video and I learned a few things from it too.  Nice work!
653351,Live2fish85,2012-01-04 22:39:00,1633,Awesome video. I can't wait for there to be some ice.
653355,Joey,2012-01-04 22:47:00,9122,"Simply Awesome Aaron, great stuff"
653358,Homer Is King,2012-01-04 22:51:00,305,Great video!! Very informative! I've GOT to get out there this year!
653367,d_paluch,2012-01-04 23:08:00,343,awesome video!  maybe this winter I can catch something other than perch through the ice with the help of the information in that episode!
