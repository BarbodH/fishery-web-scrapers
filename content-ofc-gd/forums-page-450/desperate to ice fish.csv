657083,kickingfrog,2012-01-16 17:38:00,8333,"Well I'm going this Saturday, 'cause I can't the next weekend. My usual partner in crime is out and so is Simcoe. I'm looking at maps and I'm driving north long before sun-up.  I may even drive all the way to Nipissing just for the day."
657086,irishfield,2012-01-16 17:48:00,26272,"There is safer ice closer to home Rob. 10"" on the Sound "
657088,DRIFTER_016,2012-01-16 17:49:00,10439, That's dedication!!! I'm lucky as I have only to walk out the front door and hop on the sled. Plus I get to start in eary November and finish in May!!
657090,Fish Farmer,2012-01-16 18:09:00,2234,"My buddy and myself are fishing Gilford tomorrow Rob, might be a little closer. I'll report how we made out. From what I've been reading, lots of small Perch being caught. We have a BIG itch to scratch"
657092,Rod Caster,2012-01-16 18:12:00,5784,"Not interested in Little lake or even Huntsville area? Nip has been productive this year, so maybe its worth the trip... Good luck, I feel bad for you Barrie guys this year."
657093,Skipper D,2012-01-16 18:21:00,1970,"I  ice fish thru all you guys this winter , i never was one to go on the ice and always said that you would never catch me ice fish but , i found myself yesterday morning out in the shop with a pail of frozen water i found practising dilling hole in it with my half inch drill and laughing , i hope this is not a sign ............ keep it coming boy's ."
657099,johnnyb,2012-01-16 19:13:00,3413,"By Saturday I think there will be lots of good ice closer than Simcoe.  I was chasing lakers, albeit unsuccesfully, in Muskoka on this past weekend."
657106,kickingfrog,2012-01-16 19:22:00,8333," I have, and will, consider it.   Ya your posts, as well as others, do not really help me get through these mild winters.   I figure this is a good chance to try something different anyway. Who knows, I may end up down there after all.    I've done Little lake every other time Simcoe hasn't froze and it does not hold much appeal anymore. I've been scouting the Huntsville/ Bracebridge/ Minden area map as well.    Just going a little stir crazy I guess."
657162,NAW,2012-01-16 22:13:00,4022,Lots of ice around Simcoe County.  No need to do a long trip.  G-bay has lots of back bays froze up.  Lots of Musoka lakes are ready to go too.
657361,johnnyb,2012-01-17 14:10:00,3413,Could be a big pile of snow and slush in Muskoka by the weekend now  
657437,kickingfrog,2012-01-17 17:21:00,8333,Ya if it does turn cold I may pack the skates just in case.
657651,landry,2012-01-18 05:12:00,1005, Why not hit Simcoe - it should be fine saturday if the wind does not wreck it. East side of Cook's has 4 - 5 inches. If it survives the rain and wind tonight it may be thicker by Saturday as it is cold till then
657666,fishindevil,2012-01-18 11:45:00,6254,they are ice fishing in the kawarthas big time lots of safe ice too !!!!
