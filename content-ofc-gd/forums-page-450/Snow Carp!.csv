The weather forecast was for high winds and rain turning to snow but I liked the rising temperature the south wind was bringing. When I got there I found that snow and ice covered the banks which are steep and rocky.    This was not a safe situation so i checked out some other spots but ended up going back to my original spot. With the application of a few buckets of gravel I had a safe place to land fish  I took a while before the action started. I banked four fish before I decided to head home. Here is one of the four.    The day turned out to be pretty decent. The rain stopped when I set up and eventually the winds calmed down as well. All in all a great afternoon on the bank. Oh and one more thing, puffs rule!"
