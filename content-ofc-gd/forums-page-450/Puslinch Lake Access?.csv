658333,landry,2012-01-20 01:53:00,1005, There is info in a puslinch topic - look back a few pages. Enter off townline near the roundabout but on the hespeler side.
658334,luclarochelle,2012-01-20 01:54:00,37,"Alright thanks Dan, I really hope they find a way too get Puslinch back up and running. I will hopefully be getting out to Belwood sometime soon too get some nice eyes!!"
658336,luclarochelle,2012-01-20 01:56:00,37," Okay thank you, I will have too check that out! Do you ever fish Puslinch? If so, do you target crappie or perch?"
