658118,bow slayer,2012-01-19 16:26:00,1074,I have an older polaris cover that will fit a late eighties up to mid 90s polaris snow machine. It was used on an older trail but would fit any of the older 500s as well. It is well used condition but it is better than no cover and the price is right...free.
