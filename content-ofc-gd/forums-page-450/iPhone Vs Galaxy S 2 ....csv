658298,bassjnkie,2012-01-20 00:54:00,1101," I was worried about that, how is the built in screen protected. I have to say the phone will well worth it.   The case is for the S II Skyrocket, exactly the same as the LTE."
658300,lifeisfun,2012-01-20 00:56:00,99, I actually like the built in screen protector
652614,backbay,2012-01-02 14:08:00,773,"My iphone 4 serves as a mobile office, and does well at it. I used to use a Blabckberry for work but when I left I got the iphone. I can't comment on other brands but the iphone does well for me, save for the fact that autocorrect can sometimes be a pain, and I think my old BBY was a slightly more powerful phone. With the apps and features these days, I can't imagine that either Samsung or iphone wouldn't serve you well."
652620,craigdritchie,2012-01-02 14:23:00,1586,"You have an iPhone now. Why switch to a knock-off?  Let's face it, that's precisely what the Galaxy is - hardware and software alike."
652636,BucktownAngler,2012-01-02 15:31:00,582," dont see how its a knockoff, since it has better hardware and software.  my buddy went to get the iphone 4s, was playing with the siri at the store, and told me most of the functions wouldnt even work because were in canada.  he then went and purchased the galaxy s2"
652738,ctranter,2012-01-02 21:57:00,543," Knock off?  No way.  It's hardly a knock off as it was released half a year before the 4S, and still has more powerful hardware, better camera, and the best part is you don't get your boys in a vice, which is exactly what buying an Apple product means.  External memory slots to increase the digital capacity... Tons and I mean TONS more freeware apps including completely fresh operating systems... More customizability and control across the board.  I ditched my stock OS, installed a new Boot OS and overclocked my phone to 1.5ghz.  That's nearly 30% faster than the 4S.  I also cleared all of the garbage ""filler"" that phone companies preload on all phones (Bell apps, ect...)  If you want a a great phone that serves most basic user needs, get an iPhone.  If you want a great phone that allows you much more freedom and less restrictions, get an Android."
652759,Live2fish85,2012-01-02 23:47:00,1633, It can't be a knock of seeing as there software is just updated to have the voice to text that the old galaxy has.
652812,craigdritchie,2012-01-03 03:07:00,1586,"Galaxy's graphic interface (including the whole swiping with your fingers thing) is a dead knock-off of Apple's OS.  Whole concept of a full-facing touchscreen is also a dead knock-off of Apple.  Samsung has added some features that Apple omitted, but no question they have taken Apple's approach and tweaked it. They didn't create anything original whatsoever."
652830,Dan668,2012-01-03 04:02:00,1120,"And apple stole the touchscreen interface from nokia..my brother just bought the iphone 4s, siri isnt that good imo, doesn't even work half the time, just like the galaxy counterpart. Both need some work, but id rather type and do the stuff myself. I have a blackberry just because 90% of my contacts are on bbm, but will be getting myself a quad core android phone when they are released."
652834,Live2fish85,2012-01-03 04:51:00,1633,"Apple didn't create the full touch niether I had a HTC that was touch well before IPhones came out. Mind you is was a piece of crap it was still out long before the IPhone. I would say IPhone copied the dull touch screen and made it better, that is until Samsung came along and made a better device."
652835,Dan668,2012-01-03 04:54:00,1120," I think i  may have had that same htc device haha, smashed it after 2 months. I tried to convince my brother to go for the galaxy. He ""knew"" it was the better phone, but prefered the smaller screen of the iphone."
652927,cityfisher,2012-01-03 18:10:00,959, i went from iphone to S2 and wouldnt go back..... My wife thinks my S2 screen is too big .. she wants the 4S... mostly because it comes in Pretty White ..lol
652929,lifeisfun,2012-01-03 18:39:00,99," Hehe, that's funny that you think that Apple is the master mind of all inventions This was a favorite phrase of Jobs: ""Good artists copy; great artists steal"""
652936,craigdritchie,2012-01-03 19:15:00,1586,"Never said Apple invented everything. Where did you get that idea? But there is no question they were first to bring the current mobile OS technology to market in a useful way. By doing so, they created something useful. Galaxy, and other knock-offs, are all doing the same basic thing as Apple, rather than come up with their own original ideas.  As a business strategy, there's nothing wrong with being a follower instead of a leader. If you want to follow a follower, then be my guest."
652937,BillM,2012-01-03 19:24:00,17367,"For being a leader, it sure took Apple a long time to figure out 'cut and paste'  "
652940,Live2fish85,2012-01-03 19:29:00,1633,IPhone is also a follower then seeing as my old HTC was out well before the IPhone. It also could do any thing the IPhone could other then the apps. Yes it was a piece of crap but it was out a few years before IPhone. I am not saying IPhone are garbage still the second best phone probably but Samsung was the first with the voice to text and IPhone copied that. The only thing that the Androids copied was the Apps and even they are better. IPhone has very few free apps and the ones they do are garbage. Any app that is for money the Android has as well. Again IPhone is a good phone that copied another phone and made it better then Samsung improved what the IPhone didn't think of. Even the IPhone copied Samsung to have the voice recognition. Other then that they are pretty much the same. So IPhone didn't invent the Touch Screen the copied it and improved and then Samsung did so from them just making it better. I think the biggest thing is people feel above others and like they are better because they have an Apple product doesn't mean they are the best.
652954,Carp,2012-01-03 20:33:00,1488,I have a Blackberry and love it. It does everything I need and more. Battery lasts a long time too. I can't comment on the other devices because I have no experience with them.  Good luck !
653005,lifeisfun,2012-01-03 22:04:00,99, You got that wrong they were only the first company that you noticed. You will find devices that used that same technology before.
653006,lifeisfun,2012-01-03 22:05:00,99,You got that right
653093,Pope29,2012-01-04 02:15:00,29,"Apple was good at getting technology to the forefront.....truth is they just bettered a lot old technology and marketed it very well. No one owes Apple anything....RIM introduced a lot more technology and hold way more patents than Apple and Samsung holds 10X more.  Remember when IBM made all the computer hardware....where would we be now if not for competing hardware factions. BTW IOS and Android were both built upon Linux/Unix, both open source software."
653094,BillM,2012-01-04 02:19:00,17367,"Unix isn't open source   SunOS, HPUX, BSD aren't given away for free..."
653102,Pope29,2012-01-04 02:52:00,29,"  Ok...loosely licensed then....I'm sure SunOs/Solaris is open source, the other two I'm not that familiar with. There are several Unix flavors that are free. Unix has a huge family tree."
653123,BillM,2012-01-04 03:42:00,17367,"You are confusing Unix and Linux... Both based upon System V, but completely different when it comes to licensing."
653136,Pope29,2012-01-04 04:30:00,29,Yeah..anyway.....
653138,BillM,2012-01-04 04:36:00,17367,Think of this as a learning experience
658247,bassjnkie,2012-01-19 22:42:00,1101,"So thanks for all the suggestions and I went with the Gaxlaxy s II. I am really loving this phone and will never go back.  I want to protect the phone, so I was looking at the Otterbox Defender. If anyone has this case please let me know what you think of it? And, Any suggestions on good apps? Thanks."

651964,bassjnkie,2011-12-30 23:27:00,1101,"So I'm up for a phone upgrade and would like some user opinions. Presently I am using an iPhone 3G and had no problems with it.  I am looking at the iPhone 4S, but very interested in the Samsung Galaxy S 2 LTE. So hopefully I can get some opinions on these phones. Any help appreciated.  Daniel"
651965,aplumma,2011-12-30 23:30:00,6896,Iphone 3 is my current phone and I am very happy with it.  Art
651969,Live2fish85,2011-12-30 23:47:00,1633,I have the Samsung and it is an amazing phone. I know a bunch with Iphones and a few with the new Iphone 4s which is a joke. They bring it out as an upgrade to come equal with the old galaxy and have the voice to text. Try the Galaxy you won't be disapointed. I went with it and love it.  The galaxy also has a bigger screen and is thinner.
651973,OutdoorDan,2011-12-30 23:53:00,325,"I have the Galaxy S2, and it's great.  Very thin, huge screen, and it is extremely light.  Also the exterior of it seems very durable.  The Iphone can't do anything that the GS2 can't do, and I think physically the Galaxy is a better phone, and depending on how savvy you are, you will have more options with an Android OS.  It also tethers great if you ever need a computer with an internet connection in a remote place.  The only negative I can think of is actually that it's so light for its size sometimes I feel like I might drop it."
651979,scugpg,2011-12-31 00:02:00,1373,Hear good things about the s2 and ice cream sandwich is coming out soon and make it even better. S2 for sure
651981,FishAbout,2011-12-31 00:05:00,106,I have have the Samsung Galaxy S 2 and like it very much. I bought the otter box for it and seems to very durable with it on it.
651982,JamesG,2011-12-31 00:07:00,32,"I have a galaxy S and really like it.  I'd be looking at the Nexus if its availible on your carrier, or if its out shortly, i'd wait"

652003,workwear,2011-12-31 01:50:00,592,the new bolds are touch screen......
652009,Dutch,2011-12-31 02:23:00,831,"If you have other apple devices, like an imac or ipad, then it would be nice to integrate the iphone with those.  I have the GS2 and it is a great device.  I don't even really use it as a phone that often.  I like it more as a handheld computer, to use the apps.  Blackberry is in its deathroes avoid at all costs."

652016,mike rousseau,2011-12-31 02:34:00,4661,I live on my iPhone...  Awsome device...  But if your phone is still good... Why not wait to get a new one...  You might end up getting a good deal or a better phone in a couple months...

Doesn't matter which one you get.....the capabilities of these things are utterly stupifying LOL. I went from a flip phone to a phone that is a gps, a flashlight, a wackload of video games, a level, a photo editor, heck I can play and record my guitar thru the dang thing"
652087,Ice_ice,2011-12-31 07:59:00,18,".. I'm like the 3rd guy on here with IPhone 3. Never had a problem with it. And before this one I had every phone out there, including Blackberry piece of crap. I would have to agree with the other IPhone 3 users: why bother with getting a new phone? Why? P.S. Friendly joke : IPhone 4s ... Why don't they just say it "" IPhone For Ass "" lol get it?"
652097,Live2fish85,2011-12-31 11:45:00,1633," I agree about the Blackberry phones being crap. Even for business as if you have hands bigger then a child typing is limilted. Also IPhones a good but S2 is better, the only problem about Samsung is they are one of the main companies putting these wonderful turbines all over our Province."
652107,PAZE,2011-12-31 12:25:00,132,"I was never an apple fan till I tryed this phone out, Apple is so much more advanced then everybody else, you can say what you want, people who are putting there phone above iphone wont admite they bought a peice of crap. iPhone is the only way to go, theres not EVEN a close second. Every other brand is a copy, look where phones where a few years ago to now, and there ipad, who was the first and everybody else just followed suit. Do yourself a favour and by the iphone you wont ever look at an other phone again. RIM was king for a while and even competed with apple where are they now? now galaxy or whatever you call them? This is not an opinion its a fact. Buy an iphone.  Paul"
652124,Live2fish85,2011-12-31 13:47:00,1633,If IPhone is so far ahead then why did they just release the 4S which was only upgraded to voice to text. The old galaxy was out before the IPhone 4 and and it had it I believe that is so they could keep up. He was looking at a good phone which no one said IPhones were crap but not the best no more. So maybe you should try it before commenting I have used both and would take the Galaxy hands down. If your a materialistic person then buy an IPhone to fit in lol.  Also Blackberry was the first smartphone meaning IPhone copied them. Just with vast improvments. Then Samsung showed IPhone.
652129,vinnimon,2011-12-31 14:07:00,2593,"I for one can only comment on the i phone, and Im very pleased with it. Im no puter guru nor did I care for cell phones at all.  I have the iphone 4 3g, its exteremly convenient and easy to use. I do like the fact that i can use my laptop without any cords attached.  My other cell is much like a blackberry and I dont really care too much for the screen size and the tiny buttons. To each their own, i like my iphone:thumbsup_anim"
