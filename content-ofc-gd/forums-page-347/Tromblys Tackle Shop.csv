It's on page 13 listed at $299, would be a super price.  Instead of leaving rubber launch strips through Angus, I made the phone call,  like usual, if it looks to good to be true, it is a misprint.    Ah well saved the time and gas and maybe someone else that was looking to get one cheap."

750712,Fisherman,2012-12-10 15:19:00,7201,"It ended up being the wrong picture, the wrong model and the wrong price.  I'm not saying bait and switch,   but ya never know."
750897,richyb,2012-12-10 23:55:00,774,There always seems to be a misprint or 2 in their flyers. They have lured me in to buy shotgun shells a couple of times that are the wrong picture shell length and shot size.
