750239,Roy,2012-12-08 19:17:00,13728,"I didn't hit the ice one time last season. This year I promised myself that I'd get out as often as I could if the ice is safe enough to withstand my heavy, muscular body. Last week I went through what I thought I had as ice fishing gear...not a lot.  I have two manual augers but I'm sure I can rub the blade edges and not even scratch the skin. I won't change the blades cause there's always that angle thing and the blades are almost as much as a new auger. As for tipups, we're allowed 10 here, I either lost them or, at least I can't find them. I ordered a few from a new guy on the block here. Jigerr Jigging Sticks. Actually, it was a recommendation from TJ and so I looked at the site and the stuff looks great...good price too. I just need to ice a few fish this winter. I'm certainly not hardcore on the ice thing but I really enjoy it. Take look at the Jigerrs in announcements and tell me what you guys think. Thanks for any and all advice."
750267,mike rousseau,2012-12-08 21:26:00,4661,If you think your blades are toast... Then you have nothing to loose.... Just take a file and freshen up the edges.... If it works great... If not then buy new blades...  10 tip ups.... That's crazy.... I gotta start ice fishing Quebec... We only get 2 lines here period..... And 5 tip ups and 3 rods in NY state....
750269,esoxansteel,2012-12-08 21:39:00,1307,"  Thats why Roys so lean and muscular, lookin after 10 tip-ups must be quite a chore, when you run into a school of fish"
750270,misfish,2012-12-08 21:45:00,29133,Finbor 3. Nuff said.
750279,Rod Caster,2012-12-08 22:23:00,5784,Yup and blades are only 15 to replace
750318,Sinker,2012-12-09 02:08:00,8692,"I replace the blades on my manual auger every year, whether they need them or not. They're not expensive. You can get a set for pretty much any auger for less than $30. There is nothing worse than an auger that won't cut....just get the new blades. You won't regret it!  S."
750440,Leecher,2012-12-09 17:46:00,7832,"Roy, those Jigerr's look pretty slick... Compact, light weight, well designed & doesn't require a base, just a stick to hook them up with the strap provided... If I was to buy one of those, I'd probably rigged them with a small reel with a drag system so that when they're hung on the stick, enables me to set the drag for added sensitivity    Too many times I've seen a tipup go down, run to it and when you get there fish is gone because too much resistance.  As for your augers, give the blades a good refresh with a hand file making sure you keep the same angle on the blade.  I've done this a few times myself but when they just don't cut right, replacing the blades was the solution to this problem.  Good luck with your hard water season! TJunkie"
