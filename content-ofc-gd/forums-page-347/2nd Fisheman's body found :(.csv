750716,Joey,2012-12-10 15:36:00,9122,Was sad to read this in the Toronto Sun this morning  My condolances to the families  http://www.torontosun.com/2012/12/09/body-of-2nd-fisherman-recovered-from-lake-huron
750722,NAW,2012-12-10 15:48:00,4022,Very sad news.  A 14' boat on lake Ontario.  I have never fished lake Ontario before.  But that seams a little risky.  No?
750728,DRIFTER_016,2012-12-10 16:07:00,10439,  Done it quite a few times back when you could fish the outflow at the Bruce generating station. Put in @ the launch and run the couple of miles to the station. Always wore my floater suit though.
750730,Live2fish85,2012-12-10 16:08:00,1633, I have been out on Lake Erie and Lake Ontario in a 12' and 14' tinner and as anything it is a matter of common sense. Don't go out when there is much wind and don't push it.  Very sad news that is for sure.
750732,bigugli,2012-12-10 16:14:00,6138,"Locals have been running the east shore of Gbay and the north shore of Huron in small boats forever and a day. L Simcoe can also get quite brutal for a small tinny on the wrong day. Its a risk they are willing to take. I've had relatives make that mistake, but lucky enough to survive."
750735,fishindevil,2012-12-10 16:33:00,6254,They were out of Stoney and kettle point First Nations they said !!!! And yes I have fished Lake Ontario for many years in 14ft tinnies but not when it's brutal weather that's for sure.... It goes to show it can happen in a second specially this time of year as well ...
750748,Cookslav,2012-12-10 17:27:00,1457,Dang...sad news  I've been out in December many a time in a 14' or 16' but not in the open waters of Huron. Even on smaller bodys of water like Quinte the weather is always top of mind and IMO a floater suit is manditory. That being said...they were out a mile from shore in Huron and found 2 days later...a floater suit would have done little to prolong the inevitable in that situation.  My biggest worry when out on the weater this time of year is mechanical failure... Who knows these guys may have only intended to be out 100 yards and had a motor fail.... So many things can go wtong out there this time of year.  My condolences to the families...especially this time of year

Must respect Georgian bay as well.Can sure turn nasty with little shelter. And as said,a mechanical breakdown and a off shore breeze,lookout."
