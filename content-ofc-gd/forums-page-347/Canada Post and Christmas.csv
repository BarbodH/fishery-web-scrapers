749517,Roy,2012-12-05 23:20:00,13728,"Around Christmas time every year I always used to joke ""Don't mail your Christmas cards out too early because Canada Post is liable to get them mixed up with last year's cards."" Well, I'm here to take all of that back and to congratulate them this time. Monday morning this week (the 3rd) I went to the post office with twenty individual letters to Santa Claus from some kidlets that I know. Today, Wednesday the 5th, it seems that all or most of the children received a personal letter from Santa Claus. I don't know how they did that but thank you Canada Post and of course thank you Santa."
749519,aplumma,2012-12-05 23:23:00,6896,"Glad to hear that Roy I know the kids are excited about the thoughts of Santa and greatful fortheir ""elf"" he has to watch over them the past year.   Art"

749580,cram,2012-12-06 04:19:00,1733,"People complain about the mail, but i'm constantly amazed by how fast some stuff comes through the system...especially now when it should be choking on volume."
749581,Nipfisher,2012-12-06 04:21:00,2449,"  Roy, Just doing what you do for the kidlets you know....you're better than Santa."

749608,Roy,2012-12-06 11:54:00,13728," Yes I heard that. Quite the hardship for your kids, eh?"
