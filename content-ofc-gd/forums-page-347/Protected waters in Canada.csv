750366,singingdog,2012-12-09 12:26:00,1047," I agree. I wasn't defending the recent change, just trying to clarify it.  I brought this issue up on OFC almost 2 years ago, and it didn't raise a peep. Go figure."
750374,Rod Caster,2012-12-09 12:52:00,5784,"I was in rant mode haha. I thought you had explained it well.  Its funny how people are reactive and not proactive against these things, including myself."
750380,jedimaster,2012-12-09 13:14:00,3472,"Personally I don't think the fed should have much to do with certain bodies of water. Some that go between provinces, or countries yes, but ones that are contained within a province should be regulated at the provincial and municipal level. No different than land, roads sewage systems, water treatment, electricity etc... if you have ever had to deal with water development the same things you need to do provincially uou have to de federally and in many cases also on the municipal. So to say that the waters are now unprotected is outright false and blatantly liberal propaganda. Now one could argue some things should be in the hands of feds versus provinces of course but why in both? It""s jist extra fat imo."
750385,Rod Caster,2012-12-09 13:24:00,5784,"Even inland and provincially bound lakes are part of larger watersheds. If the feds don't have a say in overall water development then we have a fractured system. The ontario MOE and the federal Environment Canada operate completely differently. Its not necessarily liberal propoganda becasue we don't know how these changes will affect water protection. Do you think the provinces has completely filled in the gap, so quickly? Its more than just a shift in control, its a chance to remove science and research from the process. The feds do not like environmental science if you haven't noticed yet.  By the way, not all environmental proponents are liberal, shake your head for trying label and divide people."
750390,jedimaster,2012-12-09 13:47:00,3472,"I am not trying to divide anyone but to say that the waterways are now unprotected is false. The provinces already regulate the waterways that the feds were also regulating. The overlap in paperwork, bureaucracy and waste is amazing. Not all lakes and rivers travel between provinces or countries. If you notice I did say that those that do should be regulated federally. In fact there are still lakes and rivers that are regulated federally. Did you know that there was consultation with the provinces to what lakes and rivers were kept in federal hands? Also nova scotia did make any requests to keep there lakes and rivers under the arms of the feds. In fact all of the provinces were consulted with and not one asked for any additions to the list.thechronicleherald.ca/novascotia/224737-ottawa-to-ns-cry-me-a-river  Once I find the actual list if there are some lake that I think should be federally protected that aren't I'll be contacting the provincial govt to ask questions. This is truly something that I think falls in the lap of the provinces. Nt for everything but for many of them yes."
750395,bushart,2012-12-09 13:59:00,2628,"As Megan Leslie stated in that link I posted  This is all about more removal of waterway protection making Northern Gateway easier to pass  1st omnibus budget---lets change the fisheries act  2nd---lets change nav water act  ""and By the way, not all environmental proponents are liberal, shake your head for trying label and divide people.""  This is true---but being this is a non-political thread---we can only think it---cause pretty sure the Right is not inviting too close of scrutiny about now    """
750397,jedimaster,2012-12-09 14:08:00,3472,"Who do you think would have a better grasp on what would affect a particular lake or watershed? A provincial govt that is accountable to those in the immediate vicinity of that watershed or those that are creating blanket regulations across an entire country. What works for BC won't necessarily work for Ont or NS. There is now removal of science or environmental from the process. All of that still remains as it always has with the provinces and municipalities. If you have ever dealt with any water project the most strict constraints are within the municipal level. The federal paperwork is just a rubber stamp. The regulations were loose and for the most part irrelevant and almost always overlap. Another thing to consider is who is more reachable and accountable to you as a fisherman? The feds, provinces or muni's? I have always had betted luck getting results and response from smaller govts."
750400,woodenboater,2012-12-09 14:20:00,2277,and one wonders if closing the ELA was part of this plan all along...
750401,bushart,2012-12-09 14:24:00,2628,  Yup  Keep the masses ignorant of facts---and call it cost saving measures
750542,Rod Caster,2012-12-09 22:54:00,5784," That is correct as a whole, but the MOE/MNR has a different role than the DFO or Env. Can. Different agencies with different mandates. There isn't much in the provincial legislations relating to public water access or shoreline protection/development. Ontario regs have more to do with water quality standards.   Trust me, the DFO has (had) teeth. I've had to deal with them before with work. The overlap is actually good for protection because  the Municipal and/or provincial regulators are sometimes left in situations that are beyond their jurisdication (or the problem is unprecedented), at which point the feds would step. There is definitely a reduction in protection here, it's not total, but there's less than there was. It's a matter of time before a case emerges where the gap is truly visible."
749932,Nipfisher,2012-12-07 17:02:00,2449,"This IS NOT intended to be a political thread. Please do not make it so.  This is about fishing and protected waters and shorelines. I live in North Bay and our city was in support of the changes that could now allow for development along the shores of many once protected lakes including some in Algonquin Park. The City of North Bay feels that this will increase tourism in this area. I do not support it.  The act now provides a list of federally protected waters â€” three oceans, 97 lakes and 62 rivers.  Here is the CBC article on it. http://www.cbc.ca/ne...udget-bill.html  Lets have some discussion on how it can /will impact our favourite little lakes."

750013,Rod Caster,2012-12-07 22:06:00,5784, Hahaha  can't a guy turn a catchy phrase without being called out   A lot of rivers and lakes are now exposed to development.... I'm guessing the next step is to sell valuable crown land or increase township sizes.
750014,BillM,2012-12-07 22:11:00,17367,"This is just at the Federal level though, it says nothing about Provincial laws in place to protect the rivers or lakes."

750097,dhickey,2012-12-08 03:02:00,1038,I think certian parts of the world should be protected regardles of economic gain. Central Afica/parts of South America/Northern Europe/North and South poles/ the list is virtualy endless.  I guess I am a Redneck tree hugger afterall???

750101,nofish4me,2012-12-08 03:10:00,404," So, I'm out of the loop again, exactly how is it that the 2.499 million lakes and rivers became unprotected?"

750105,bushart,2012-12-08 03:19:00,2628,"  The republicans in power packaged it up nicely and stuck it into yet another omnibus budget bill  The environment just gets in the way of $$$ with these guys  Wonder why the First Nations Chiefs protested on Parliament hill the other day and attempted to force their way into the house of commons??  Next----question----now China buys Nexen--they'll want ""Their"" oil to the coast-----any bets on how it gets there??"
750145,singingdog,2012-12-08 12:15:00,1047," It has to do with the definition of ""navigable waterway"". According to the old law, any navigable waterway was protected under federal law. ""Navigable"" was such a broad term that pretty much any stream, river, or lake that you could get a canoe down was identified as navigable. The old law was rooted in the traditions that established the country: trapping and moving goods by canoe. Any development (culvert, bridge, wing dam, dock....) on those navigable waterways were subject to federal regulation, including environmental assessment plans.  What the Harper govt has done is redefine ""navigable"" to reflect current industrial reality: goods are moved via huge ships now.  The 2.5 million lakes and rivers are not ""unprotected"", they just aren't protected under the navigable waterways act. Provincial and municipal regulations still apply."

750193,Rod Caster,2012-12-08 15:33:00,5784," Unfortunately, the MOE has already been cutback bigtime and is dealing with a young and inexperienced laborforce. A lot of what they learned over the years with regards to the Provincial laws and nuances has essentially retired or quit. They are stuck re-training and making a lot of amateur mistakes, wasting resources and essentially losing the ability to properly regulate affairs. Now that these previously Federal tasks are downloaded onto the provinces, it'll further dilute their ability to regulate.  The silliest thing is that many rivers and lakes are inter-provincial waterways which means the provinces, all with different environmental legislations, are stuck arguing between themselves with no overseeing powers. Who owns the Ottawa River? How the hell do you regulate that properly when Quebec and Ontario may have their own ideas of what is right. When they get into a big fight about this or that, who is gonna step in now? As far as municipalities, they typically don't get into environmental issues because of the fear of crossing into Provincial or Federal legislation and getting into lawsuits. Hopefully, from these changes, if anything, municipalities will pick up some of the slack.... but I doubt the Feds intend to contribute funds for this.  Things that are beyond provincial borders should be regulated by the Federal government.....duh  I wonder how this will affect water access, whereas before if I could canoe a river, I could use it (unless special provisions exist).... not sure how that changes now. I don't think the provinces have water navigation legislation."
