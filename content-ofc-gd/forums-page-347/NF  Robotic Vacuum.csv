750638,captpierre,2012-12-10 03:51:00,2521,Just got back from our son's in Ottawa.  He has a robotic vacuum and he and his wife love it.  The wifey was all over it.  Thinks she would like one for Christmas.  Anybody use one?  Peter
750655,moemoe,2012-12-10 07:18:00,352,"bought one, a roomba and returned it, you still have to move all the furniture out of the way for thing, might as well vacuum your self by the time you clear all objects"
750868,captpierre,2012-12-10 22:20:00,2521,was wondering if they were a gimmick but they have been around for a while

Works great on hardwood. Not so good on other textured surfaces.  If you're a clean nut, they are good."
750947,Twocoda,2012-12-11 03:11:00,4130,We actually have two of them...one upstairs and one downstairs...personally i think they are great...with 4 animals in our house... dog and cat hair is a thing of the past...we run them daily and forget about them until they tell us they need to be plugged in...mind your battery to the machine though...run it dead and charge it full everytime
