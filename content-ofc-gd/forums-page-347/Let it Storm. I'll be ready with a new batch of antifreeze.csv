750532,Leecher,2012-12-09 22:30:00,7832,Nice stash Bruce   Your secret is safe with me
750585,John,2012-12-10 00:52:00,2956,I'm closer than either of them Bruce you can hide it in Burlington I have a nice cool spot...
750586,Joeytier,2012-12-10 00:57:00,3990,That sounds fantastic
750612,bigugli,2012-12-10 02:04:00,6138,It just would not be Christmas without a good mixture of traditional brandies. To go with the elderberry I have a bottle of Napoleon and a bottle of Lingonberry.  Just right for keeping the chill off.
750620,crappieperchhunter,2012-12-10 02:30:00,2582,Your stash always looks good Bruce   Thx for reminding me about  festive season traditions. I will have to get out for our  annual bottle of dark rum  and a couple of cartons of eggnog...oh and I better check the spice rack for nutmeg too
750623,bigugli,2012-12-10 02:40:00,6138,Had my first glass of nog this evening as a wee reward.  Hopefully we get to share a nip or 2 from the recipe out on the ice this winter
750625,crappieperchhunter,2012-12-10 02:58:00,2582,  Sounds like a plan my friend
