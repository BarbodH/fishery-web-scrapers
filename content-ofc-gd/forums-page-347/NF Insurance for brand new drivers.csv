Cost to replace was about 400 bucks. Insurance on glass over that time period, about 3000 bucks. And if you're creative, you can still get your glass paid through insurance by vandalism.

750107,Luke V.,2012-12-08 03:27:00,286,When I first started driving I paid 120/ month on a 2002 2dr cavalier. Dad owns the car and I'm the primary driver. That was when I was 18. Now I have 4 tickets 2 with points Drive a 94 Dakota. Dad owns the truck and I pay 254. Neither of these has collision or fire or thelft. Liability only. Being only 21 I have looked at going on my own. Latest quote I got. 250/month. Fire theft and collision plus 1 million liability. ( this is once my driving record is cleared) Your getting hosed in my opinion. Where you live should not dictate how much you pay. Go find yourself a broker. You should be able to find better insurance rates. Good luck with the hunting. It's a pain in the butt.

Oh well, I said to him. Last fall, same thing with another apprentice. These guys are racking up the points against their license renewal and insurance. And while we are getting paid by the hour to drive. I don't get it. I just sit back, watch the speedometer, and wait. And laugh. They also tailgate on the highway while doing 100 kph+, and rarely, if ever come to a complete stop at a stop sign. Wanna know why insurance is so high for young people? Just come for a ride with me and one of my apprentices some day. Each and every one of them should not have a license."
750109,DRIFTER_016,2012-12-08 03:58:00,10439,"  Of course it should. If you live and drive in the Toronto area you have a much higher chance of A:/ theft or break in B:/ getting in an accident due to the much busier roadways than say me who lives in an area with 18,000 people. The city of Toronto has about 150X the population of Yellowknife. If you also take into account the number of people in the surrounding area (GTA) as they drive the same roads, the number increases to 300X the amount of people.  Lets just pretend all of the people in both cities drive. You could surmise that people in the GTA are 300X more likely to make an insurance claim than someone in Yellowknife.  Se where I'm going with this? So even though you're 300X more likely to make a claim than I am you aren't paying 300X what I am.  But if you live in an area with increased probability of having to make a claim you should have to pay more. It's an increased risk, no different than the guy with 4 tickets who pays more than the fellow with a clean driving record, or the 18 year old kid who is much more likely to get in an accident than the 50 year old father of three.  Insurance rates are based on risk and where you live either increases or decreases your risk.  Lesson over."

749445,Fish4Eyes,2012-12-05 17:30:00,1022,Try www.kanetix.ca and see what kind of quotes you get there. Its hard to find much better than what is on that site from my experiences. I lucked out and qualified for TD Meloche Monnex group insurance. They can't be touched for their prices IMO. If his moving address is Toronto then that is part of the problem too. People in TO pay quite a bit more than folks in other areas. It will also help if your son books and acquires his G license ASAP. I believe he has to wait a year from when he gets his G2 to qualify to take the test. The spots get booked up quick so I would book exactly a year from the date he gets his G2. Buying an older vehicle will help as well if you insure it with only liability. Hope this helps.  Alot of people I know left State Farm because they doubled their rates for no reason. I would be weiry.
749461,funfishing,2012-12-05 18:52:00,147," Surprisingly Belair ended up quoting me much lower than TD Meloche Monnex so I went to Belair.

In other words youâ€™re legally able to drive and a victim of an accident that youâ€™re liable for is covered to continue on with compensation. Yes high risk for you to choose this option; but an option that would be available; others around you (people youâ€™re liable to) are still covered. Thatâ€™s the essence of this law; so that innocent people are monetarily compensated, if you have a brain fart. With things the way they are, independent insurance companies know we are forced to deal with one of them and as a collective they charge us as they please.  Dan."
749585,John Bacon,2012-12-06 04:51:00,3277,"The vehicle you drive makes a big difference to the rates. But don't assume the insurance rate is going to based on the price of the vehicle. The liability portion of the insurance is usually the majority of the cost of insurance. The price of your vehicle does have anything influence on liability because that is for paying for damage to other people.  My wife's insurance increased by over a $1,000/year when we replaced the Aerostar with a Pontiac Wave. Insurance companies track the accident histories of different vehicles and use that information to determine rates. I assume that the Pontiac Wave (same as Chevy Aveo) is expensive because a lot of young people drive them.  It definitely pays to get a quote before making the purchase. You may be able to save money be getting a nicer vehicle if that vehicle type has a low accident history. I.e. a truck or van may actually be cheaper to own that a Chevy Aveo because of better insurance rates."

749351,Canuck2fan,2012-12-05 01:27:00,1444,"Ontario is unique for auto insurance because the Insurance industry here pay out the most of any jurisdiction in Canada and they LIKE doing it too. This is still true even with the reductions in our coverage from 2010 that were supposed to drop our rates.  Here is the condensed version of facts that makes auto insurance a BAD deal for customers in Ontario. A while back the insurance CEO's sat down the boys in parliment and told them they were going to stop covering autos..... Unless the province guaranteed them a 12% return AFTER ALL THEIR claims were paid out. The reason they demanded the 12% ""profit"" after claims and ""claims only"" was because at that time they could have put the money into bonds and made around a 12% return. Politicans being stupid agreed even though there were two major flaws with this arrangement.  First with the 12% being guaranteed AFTER claims that meant that for the next renewal the insurance company could raise rates to meet any shortfall to top up to 12%. It also meant that if an insurance company cracked down on fraudulent or any claims paid out for that matter they would actually HAVE to charge customers less the next year. Now they might be greedy but insurance companies aren't stupid because the margin of 12% on a million after claims doesn't look as nice on the bottom line for shareholders as 12% on a billion!!! So at no time do they have ANY incentive to cut payouts on claims dispite what they might want us to believe, because the math doesn't lie.  The second flaw with their argument about needing 12% to match would they would have gotten in the bond market is two fold. Firstly, they would NOT have HAD any money from auto claims to put in the bond market if they stopped insuring cars, but the politicans didn't seem to grasp that part. Secondly now in the bond market if you are a frigging investing savant you might get a 3% return? So now the companies are enjoying about 8 to 10% more than they could in the bond market. Of course they have to cover the losses they took by diving into the junk mortgage market a few years back.  So until a government gets the stones to say to the industry sink or swim without the 12% guarantee after your claims are paid out, our rates for auto insurance will continue to sky rocket, because the more they spend out the more they can charge the following year. Also if you don't get insurance the government will charge you and the industry will punish you with even higher rates when you do knuckle under."

Statefarm tacked on multi vehicle, house and good student discounts ( over 70). When I turned 18, statefarm let me go on my own and allowed me to keep all these discounts."
749356,Steve,2012-12-05 01:35:00,2075,"i don't work in auto insurance, but working in the industry has allowed me to pick up a couple tips.  - shop around. every year. know your details. for auto know your ticket history. no point in having someone quote you something that isn't correct, cause they likely will run a check, and your picing will change. just be upfront. for property know the age of your roof, wiring, other upgrades, anything that will make your property more attractive.  - if you do have a broker, and they can't get you a price you feel is good, then don't be afraid to shop around just your sons policy. I mean you might have a great relationship with your broker; maybe a long time deal and you don't want to move all your policies. Well, you don't have to. Call some direct writers. BelAir Direct, PC, heck, really shop around. You may be surprised that you find a single home for your son without having to change the rest of your policies.  - increased deductibles. if your son is driving an older car, with the cost of insurance, just request the highest property deductible. At least $1k. Yes, in the event of a claim, he's paying a grand, but heck, he's paying a lot more than that anyway. I can confirm that our company provides a rate break at 21 and 25. As well when you get married, or become common law. If he is only being Insured for 3rd party liability only, consider lower limits. Not something that I love to suggest, but $1m (instead of $2m) might be an option.  - distance driven per day. make sure the broker is asking you the distance driven. your son works in toronto which may mean he isn't driving far distances per day. as such, his rate should be lower. I believe our companies greatest discount is when you confirm less than 15km's per day.  - driving school discount. most companies will offer discounts for folks who have passed an accredited driving school.  oh, I'm paying $1,750 annual on a 2003 Yukon SLT w/ col, comp, $300 ded, and $2m Liab.

749411,davew3,2012-12-05 14:05:00,430,Do you have any relatives that live out in the country that he could move to?  On paper anyways.
749413,workwear,2012-12-05 14:09:00,592,  ive often thought of that....but he will STILL  one day need to get insurance...so the old saying goes...pay them now or pay them later  remember....insurance companies require you to disclose how many license drivers live at that address...  he needs to be placed on a policy otherwise it aint gonna count towards his so called experience

749420,John,2012-12-05 14:53:00,2956," Yep this is the way to do it. Our kids were listed as occasional drivers from 16 on. For 2012 F150, 2010 VW wagon, 2008 Princecraft and homeowners insurance around $350 a month."
749432,Freshtrax,2012-12-05 16:24:00,2215,Malory insurance brokes in Barrie always get me a fair deal.
749439,DRIFTER_016,2012-12-05 17:05:00,10439,When I moved from Ontario to the NWT in 2005 my car insurance instantly dropped 75%!!!! It went from $4k/yr to $1k/yr just by moving. I felt like I had won the lottery when I went to change my insurance over.
749444,ch312,2012-12-05 17:28:00,1590,"at 18 i finally got my license and got quotes on an early 90's ford tempo that were $300/month on a $500 car   ended up getting a roadmaster and paid the ridiculous insurance for a few months. i ended up with a roadmaster that cost $300 /month. my dad was with state farm so i called them to see if they'd give me a discount if i switched to them to be with the same insurer as my dad and it saved me a few bucks a month.  then, i found a nice little tidbit...listing myself as common law rather than single dropped my yearly rates by over $1000.   within 2 years my $300/month rates on a junk car dropped to $160/month for a newer dakota with full coverage. their theory is people who are in a serious relationship are more mature and less likely to cause accidents.  9 years and 3 speeding tickets later my house, truck, atv, and motorcycle (newly licensed with a xt250) are $260/month with full coverage.   FYI...state farm still gives a discount at 25. but, because i already had the marriage discount applied, when i turned 25 my rates only dropped $7/month. they said this would have been a much bigger drop if i wasn't already listed as common law.   another FYI for state farm customers. they offer a 15% discount (on top of the driving school discount) for drivers under 25 who are willing to watch a safety video and keep a driving log. this could result in huge savings for many new drivers..."
749307,davey buoy,2012-12-04 23:56:00,5505,"In a past thread We talked about the G1,G2,G graduated licensing system. Well my oldest son if all goes well,gets his G2 test in a week and a half. He is 23 now,24 end of January.We made two calls for quotes on car insurance. The first $7,749 a year,the second $7,123 a year. Wow, I get the brand new driver thing,but he has a chance to get a 2003 4 door Mazda sedan for a real decent price,certified,e-tested,no rust etc. Wants to buy it cash to not have another monthly bill. The first quote works out to $646 a month and that is PLPD only,nothing else. That's more than his rent a month. How do young people afford a new car,payments,full coverage of insurance,rent etc. Boggles the mind. Doesn't help he lives and works in TO. Anyone else been through this insurance bull with any of there kids recently?,and anyone know of a company or two with better rates? Any help would be appreciated. On a side note my youngest goes for his G2 a week later.He's 19,can't even imagine his rates."
749310,jayess,2012-12-05 00:07:00,187,"I was a career student until 25 and having done the later degrees in Toronto, I didn't need a car. Aside from putting off driving until 25 (supposedly rates significantly drop off at this age), it's really tough on young drivers.  I wish I could say i've heard of a solution aside from waiting or going for an M1 instead."
749311,Joeytier,2012-12-05 00:08:00,3990,"Wow, that is truly awful.  My first year of insurance [at age 20] was around $4000/year with a 2002 Tundra.  How is his so much higher?"
749312,bare foot wader,2012-12-05 00:08:00,1354,"he needs driving experience on his own insurance plan...TO doesn't help...the rumour/myth about dropping rates when you suddenly become more mature at the age of 25 isn't true either (at least not for me, with a squeaky clean record)  the cheapest solution for your 19 yr old, assuming he lives at home, is dad is primary and son is secondary driver...cheapest rate that way, after 1-2 years switch over to his own plan...if you're willing to risk your rates assuming he won't cause a claim  and I would've loved to find rent cheaper than 646 when i was in TO!!"
749316,workwear,2012-12-05 00:09:00,592,it is insane!!!totally insane....my daughter insurance rates are close to 3200 a yr...she is the principle driver on the car....that hurt!!  well my son just started driving and as an occasional driver I AM PAYIN  1800 a yr for him...  one thing i wonder tho is....why is it so cheap for insurance in the states...and why dont american companies come north and give us great deals...
749319,workwear,2012-12-05 00:11:00,592,oh by the way shop your insurance around...go to insurancehotline.com...you would be amazed on rates  ive learned to never be loyal to any insurance company..i check every year at renewal time...and i manage to save  good luck
749322,davey buoy,2012-12-05 00:16:00,5505," The younger goes to college in TO as well. Only in his first year,2 more after that. He'll probably come home for the summer and maybe do the occasional driver on one of my vehicles. He has no plans for a vehicle till his schooling is done."

749324,Roy,2012-12-05 00:21:00,13728,"Well how much is auto insurance in Ontario for a person with a clean record...45 years old,, driving umm say a new Corolla or any car in that price range? Is it that outrageous?"
749325,workwear,2012-12-05 00:23:00,592,wife drives an 2008 altima....clean record...pays bout 1500.....same car same scenario state side..600....why!!!!
749326,BillM,2012-12-05 00:26:00,17367,"No need for full coverage on a 2003 anything.  If he works and lives in Toronto, he should be making Toronto wages.  If not, then he really needs to think about moving."
749327,davey buoy,2012-12-05 00:31:00,5505," Well Roy,I'm 51,First vehicle is a 2008 cx7 turbo,all wheel drive fully insured.Second 99 4x4explorer sport PLPD only. $216 per month for both.Two drivers,my wife or I either vehicle.I think the young fellows are getting a bad rap without even proving themselves first. Not fair IMO."

749330,workwear,2012-12-05 00:38:00,592,your partially right randy....IF your daughter lives with you...you HAVE  to report her on your policy....but if she reside some where else she doesnt need to be  disclosed and yes she is covered..

749333,aplumma,2012-12-05 00:42:00,6896,"Insurance in the States can be expensive depending on what area you live in. I would be charged $200.00 difference if I lived just one county over. The big breaks here are age 21, Married and no tickets. We also get discounts for the number of things you insure with the company. I would think it is similar up North?   Art"
749335,irishfield,2012-12-05 00:45:00,26272,"Roy.. I have FULL coverage on my F150.. replacement (as it's financed) etc. It also has my youngest down as an occasional driver ""at school""... $1100/YEAR!  Davey Buoy... there are bonuses in having kids that want to drive at 16!.. and having them listed as occasional drivers since, to show continueous insurability before they go out on their own. If that fails.. make sure his drivers licence is changed to a new address and he ""borrowed"" your car!"
749337,davey buoy,2012-12-05 00:46:00,5505," Somewhat similar here,25 WAS the magic number,no tickets,accidents as well, multi vehicle discount or a discount for adding home,boat etc."
