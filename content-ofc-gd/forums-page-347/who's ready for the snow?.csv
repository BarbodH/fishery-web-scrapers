749347,Bernie,2012-12-05 01:17:00,3190,"This is an old one, but it still works well and gets me across the frozen lake without a problem. Just can't be in a hurry.    It will go through some slush, just don't stop in it.  "
749352,NAW,2012-12-05 01:27:00,4022," Sled needed some work after that.  I forgot to close the powder flap on the front.  Sucked in a TON of snow.  I didn't realize.  The snow melted a bit, then when I turned my sled off, it all froze!  EVERYTHING was frozen in a block of ice.....  Simcoe two years ago."
749524,IndySKS,2012-12-05 23:45:00,134," Yea that was so very long ago, i got the 4 stoke itch last year and got that sled. Completly different world than the old touring sled. Lets hope for snow this season"
749530,fishindevil,2012-12-06 00:11:00,6254,"There's always snow !!! Sometimes you just have to trailer to it !! I still managed 2,700km last year on my sled and I rode half the winter near bobcaygeon and lots in Bancroft and of course petawawa deep river area !!! And seeing how a good winter in central Ontario is aprox 13 weeks long you will only get out of it what you put into it !!!! Bring on the snow !!!!!!"
749538,BillM,2012-12-06 00:32:00,17367," Nick, did you make that rear auger bracket yourself?  That's the only thing I'm missing on my sled.  I'd love a setup similar to yours so when I'm ripping around by myself, there's no need to tow anything."
749549,Fishenforcer,2012-12-06 01:25:00,18,It's for sale....getting new ATV  http://toronto.kijiji.ca/c-cars-vehicles-ATVs-snowmobiles-snowmobiles-MXZ800-See-Pics-W0QQAdIdZ437431310 
749559,NAW,2012-12-06 02:16:00,4022,"  Ya.   It kind of morphed over time.  Started as a simple storage box for tackle/finder/etc..  then rod holders, then a tow hitch, then the auger rack.  This year I need to add a feature to mount my spud pole!  If I had to do it all over again from scratch it would look a little different.  The bravo has a small gas tank, so the box was designed to fit a 5 gallon spare gas tank.  The Auger brackets where easy to make.  Some steel plates, and square tube welded together."
749619,azebra,2012-12-06 12:56:00,168,you only wish you had this ride!!  lol  j/k

749806,Nipfisher,2012-12-07 02:56:00,2449," Hey Wally, I have the same sled. 1993 Skandic II 503R. Your is not as beat up as mine is, but I swiched out the metal skis for plastic mountain skis. Makes it alot better in the slush. Where do you live?"
749832,Wally,2012-12-07 04:17:00,28," Eastern Ontario , the Skandik replaced my Crusher, "

749196,DRIFTER_016,2012-12-04 15:49:00,10439,This was 2 1/2 weeks ago. Since then we have added close to another foot.  
749197,NAW,2012-12-04 15:51:00,4022,"Took her for a rip the other day to go fetch my ground blind.  The foot of snow we had earlier in the week collapsed my blind, and ripped big opening in the side.  Sled started on the 3rd pull, and ran like a charm!  89ish Bravo.  Gutless machine, but I love it!  I can lift the back (or front) with one arm)        "

749250,Freshtrax,2012-12-04 19:20:00,2215,  mine is a 1998 700 0n the inside.   just the hood is 600.   the thing just wont die.   i think instead of buying new one im going to swap an edge skid into it this summer and put a 136 track under it.  i love this sled.  it got some clutch work this summer and a few new studs.

749281,davey buoy,2012-12-04 22:13:00,5505,"That was a sled to be reckoned with in it's time.I had the 1981 SRX440,liquid cooled,no slouch either"
749284,misfish,2012-12-04 22:23:00,29133,Hey Sin.Thats got the darth look. I had the cheeta with the tank on the back.That was one heavy sled.
749285,Joey,2012-12-04 22:25:00,9122, That's why I bring Paul along
749295,Handlebarz,2012-12-04 22:38:00,3790,I loved the winter when I lived in Sudbury but these last few in the SW corner of Ontario have me spoiled and enjoying not shovelling or charging through slush ice freezing rain or snow.  I guess I an not ready at all. I do wish for snow East and North of the Chatham area
749299,Basskicker,2012-12-04 23:02:00,421,"Sorry, no pictures yet, but I'm picking up my 2013 Skidoo Expedition Sport Ace 600 on Friday!!! Certainly going to be a step up from the 1994 Artic Cat Jag 440."

749306,i2cool2fool,2012-12-04 23:56:00,349,Hey Indy. I see you upgraded since we have been out sledding many many moons ago.  I still have my old 1990 beater Yammy Phazer and still in the Thamesford area. Almost time for a sled upgrade.
