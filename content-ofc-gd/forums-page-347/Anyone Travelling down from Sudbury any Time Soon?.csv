750274,Joey,2012-12-08 22:09:00,9122,"As the title says, anyone coming down, passing through or anything like that from Sudbury down to the Richmond Hill/Toronto area any time soon?  I'm trying to purchase an Otter Ice Fishing Shelter and them damn yanks won't ship it to me (no offence to our Southern Contingent   )  Closest place I've found that has it in stock is in Sudbury.  Not sure if it would cost me more in gas both ways or to have it shipped  A pick up truck or van would be needed as the guy says the sled part of it is 6'6""  I will pay your gas one way if you are already planning on coming down this way anyhow  Thanks and PM me if you want.  Joey"
