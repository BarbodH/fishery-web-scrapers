750546,Leecher,2012-12-09 23:03:00,7832,"I must say, that sled looks pretty slick Simon   I can't wait to see a video of you riding it    Over here, been the same snow wise... just a dusting     and ice wise, not much around either   rivers are wide open and back bays have a skim on them  Trout season opens on Dec 20th and hoping I can go but the weather's a little iffy right now   got's some more time to wait I'm afraid  All this to say, we don't have snow or good ice but you have a snow machine and good ice but no snow I wish you good luck this season and be good... if you can't be good, be careful TJunkie"
750624,Basskicker,2012-12-10 02:53:00,421,"Up here in Manitouwadge....we got a solid 6-8"" ice on most lakes, but we lost all our snow....making GREAT ice though....been -15 to -20 the last few nights.  Kinds sucks though Simon, I'm in the exact same position as you.....picked up my 2013 Skidoo Expedition Sport 600 Ace on Friday and had to drive it across bare spots to get it into the backyard  :wallbash:  Jason"
