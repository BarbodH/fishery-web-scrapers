Its served its purpose but its time to move on......  thoughts? cost estimates?  suggestions?  thanks,  kf"
749984,irishfield,2012-12-07 19:26:00,26272,Stowmaster folding Muskie net. You'll never go back...  make sure you get the storage bag as well. Ask Santa for it.. gonna set you back about $220 for the net and try to get someone to throw in the $30 bag. Brian at JB's did for me a few years back.
749993,mike rousseau,2012-12-07 20:02:00,4661,"When I looked to upgrade from my starter net.... I decided to buy a good mesh and put it on the frame I already have... Absolutely love it...  I put a beckmen flat bottom style pen net (fin saver?) on my frabile power catch frame...  I know others that have done the same and love it as well....  I've used a bunch of different net set ups and I find flaw with most... Mine is lightweight.... Great mesh.... And big enough to bag a 50+ incher but still easy to handle by yourself.... Those HUGE nets like the ""big kahuna"" are a pain when your by yourself and take up a LOT of room in your boat...."
749995,cram,2012-12-07 20:10:00,1733,"I have the frabill version of the stowmaster and it's been great.  Picked it up from Lebarons - they had to special order the size, but price from what i remember the price was quite good."
749996,trapshooter,2012-12-07 20:13:00,1234,"Beckman Pen FinSaver all the way.  Lightweight, strong, huge bag with FinSaver mesh.  This is Kickingfrog's 49.5"" muskie in it....    And here's another view of it with yet another 49 and change inch muskie from this fall.  "
749997,lew,2012-12-07 20:26:00,12766," I'm the same as Mike, I always preferred the Frabil frames but found the Beckman pen bags much better. I purchased the Beckman bag & put it on my Frabil frame and it make the best all-round musky net I've used.  The old Frabil bag    And the new flat bottomed Beckman pen net on the Frabil frame.    It's always good when you have the best of both worlds !!"

750005,lew,2012-12-07 21:22:00,12766," The Kahunas are nice nets, but as mentioned by Mike earlier they can be a brute to use one handed when your fishing alone."
750006,cram,2012-12-07 21:31:00,1733, Power Catch Big Game is PLENTY big.
750007,Handlebarz,2012-12-07 21:41:00,3790,"I am another who loves my Beckmann Finn saver net I have landed many musky by myself with it the biggest was 52"" it's alot easier then the big kahuna and the small mesh is awesome.  If you wait for the muskies Canada odyssey you should find some good deals there I know a bunch of guys who have bought them there. You can also check out all of the different nets to see what is the right one for you.  Cost less then $200 I would guess"
750016,darsky,2012-12-07 22:16:00,586,"""with yet another 49 and change inch muskie from this fall.""  Is Seul full of 49 and changers ?  Frabill came out with a Stowmaster copy this year. Don't know the price tho'.  Like Irish I bought my Stowmaster at JB's and I got 15% off for being with Muskies Canada"
750018,esoxansteel,2012-12-07 22:22:00,1307,"Check Stacy at protacklemuskyshop and see what he has, if you are an MCI member a discount will come your way"
750045,bigbuck,2012-12-08 00:00:00,2449,Stowmaster. I had no problem using it while fishing solo. The bag is nice to have if you move around or stow the net often in the garage/man cave.
750059,K_F,2012-12-08 01:11:00,107,Waiting for the odessy sounds like a good chance to handle several nets.....I will definately need one I can handle solo.  Thanks
