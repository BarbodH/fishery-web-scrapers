749148,GreenCanada,2012-12-04 04:05:00,375,Thanks for sharing your adventure. I hope to one day be able to experience something similarly epic.
749170,Guidofisherman,2012-12-04 13:24:00,206,Just awesome. The colors on those fish and the blueness of the water is simply amazing. I can only dream. Thanks for sharing. Alan
749193,ehg,2012-12-04 15:45:00,2666, Most spectacular fish ever. Like a brook trout on steroids. A pinnacle of fishing in Canada. Must had been a blessing being there.  Remember these from before but thanks for sharing again.
749346,Whopper,2012-12-05 01:11:00,2174,I remember the first go round  and enjoy it just as much this time.  Thanks for sharing!

748828,Moosebunk,2012-12-03 01:58:00,3970,"""OLD BAG IN THE CORNER""  by Larry W.   My buddies avoid my seat on the boards For every meal that we have in camp, And the young guys help me push out my boat, In the mornings down the slip-way ramp.  The young fellows save the cigars they receive, And always bring them back to shore, From their boats after supper To my seat by the radio room door.  They've named a place on the lake for me, A landmark all must pass, And I wonder now, just how long This connection with me will last.  For now I stagger under the shore lunch box, When I carry it to my boat's cuddy, Yet sometimes I feel it lifted from me And stowed away by a younger buddy.  And I don't suggest any fly out trips, Nor an overnight stay at some bay. Nor a thirty mile steam to a sure hot-spot, Nor a trip on a dark, windy day.  I'm exempted now from the air cargo hold, ""Leave the bags for a much younger man!"" And the firewood run is no longer my job But I can help out the cook when I can.  And far places that took me years to learn, Using maps, and compass and nerves. Are now fished by new guys with a GPS, Whilst they stare at the fish shaped like curves.  They'll never have to tail Jimmy D or Reg Starr For miles in the Arctic's strong glare. Just a couple of numbers, two tanks of gas, And unless there is ice they'll get there.  So it's easier now for me to retire, To accept someone else has my boat. To wish them success when they're on the water And not whine, nor be jealous nor pout.  Yet I still can't unpack my old dirty bag, With it's pliers and long fillet knife. For as long it sits there, all set to go, They attest to an old bush guide's life.   -End-      In the not too distant past I have written a few words now and again which spoke of Larry.  Bren and I met him on our first trip to Great Bear Lake in 2008.  Larry was a big part of our experience in the Arctic.  His stories, his demeanor... and a truly seasoned fishing and bush guide of 45 years from 1964 onwards, (and with 20 years spent angling for the world's biggest lake trout) one could probably say he was family to the fish Gods.  He treated us to an other-worldly experience.  Bren was smitten with the man, while I more in awe.  A one-of-a-kind soul, and at the same time a man who chose a living which many an angler would aspire to have, living a lifetime on the water.  Each autumn our copy of ""The Arctic Lure"" published through Plummers arrives in the mail.  It was in this years issue the above words from Larry had been put to print.  Retired I believe in 2009, 70 years of age, or so, I couldn't help but take some time to remember Larry, and to also relive some moments during what still remains the greatest trip of my life.   With downtime here at home during a soggy day.  The boat put away and Christmas lights up, before finishing what is the tradition of looking back on the fishing year at hand, I instead found myself leafing back through all the old photos of trips to Great Bear.  More specifically, the Tree River.  The Tree is just one of those places that has taken such firm roots in my soul.  A week doesn't go by that the place and it's treasures aren't thought of.  It's almost a curse to have visited the Tree, it haunts and continually pulls you to go back.  A few of our photos not shown before online, along with some other unseen pictures sent along from two friends met and whom shared time on the Tree with Bren and myself, I thought to upload our extras, dust off the oldies and put together this pictorial of the five days fishing experienced while visiting a true heaven on earth, the remote and beautiful Tree River and home of the Arctic char.    TREE CAMP.   Simply perfect.  Delicious meals, hot shower house, small tackle shop, guide cabins, guest cabins, and a main lodge for lunch and breakfast, all situated on the river's shoreline, 100 miles from the nearest town and five miles from the Arctic ocean.                           THE WILDLIFE.   A barren tundra home to the Arctic wolf, muskox, caribou, grizzly bear, fox, ptarmigan, golden eagle, peregrine and many other animals, it's in the lakes and rivers which swim enormous lake trout, grayling, and the world's greatest runs of the anadromous and giant Arctic char.             SETTING TO FOOT ON THE LAND.                   PLUNGING DOWNSTREAM TO THE OCEAN.                            Continued..."
748830,Moosebunk,2012-12-03 02:00:00,3970,"BEARING UPRIVER THROUGH THE CURRENTS.                                   BIRTHPLACE OF CHAR.   About 10 miles upriver from the Arctic Ocean, and after passing through a series of rapids which have taken the lives of men, the majestic, ""The Falls"" roars.  In the clear and icy cold pools below, the largest char in the world spawn each fall.                    FISHING THE TREE.                                  Continued..."
748832,Moosebunk,2012-12-03 02:01:00,3970,"TO CATCH ARCTIC CHAR.   My dream fish.  A fiery red char thriving within the harshest of cold at the ends of the northern forests.  Like a salmon or steelhead of age, an ocean strong fish but with roots tied to the tenacious and long-lived, lake trout, as well as the wildly beautiful speckle.  Cannot wait to hold one again some day.                                    THE ARCTIC LURE.   A little publication which is wisely titled, although these fish themselves would be reason enough...  Can’t imagine what it’s like for a man such as Larry who put his life into fishing and decades in the Arctic?  Not a week goes by that I don't think of the Tree, and my visit was only just a glimpse by comparison...  Gotta love the places fishing will take you.                            2008 & 2011.

Through Plummer's Lodges... and...  thru a good education, smart career choices, hard work and an understanding & loving wife.     The second time, by all that again plus giving friends & anglers."
