We had some amazing trips, a great camping trip which will now be a yearly thing, PB's were broke all over the place by the kiddos, and most importantly we enjoyed each other and nature .  Here are some pics, for you all to enjoy (I know I sure enjoyed them)        Taking out the local kids for a shore bass!      my boys PB pike!              My daughters first camping trip!!!  "

750141,spincast,2012-12-08 11:28:00,3279,Great report. Wish I had a place where fish like that could be found from the shore. Those kids are grinning ear to ear - says it all
750142,Handlebarz,2012-12-08 11:56:00,3790,Awesome year good on ya for getting a bunch of kids out fishing. I sure do miss fishing Sudbury for shore walleye like that. Thanks for the recap.

750196,Rod Caster,2012-12-08 15:42:00,5784,Some real nice walleye slabs there!  How were the fall walleye on the Rainy this year???
750242,manitoubass2,2012-12-08 19:40:00,11391," We have a big family, but not THAT BIG!!! lol, your post had me chuckling!    Yes, great spots indeed! Thank you! Right back atcha    Yeah, since all our kids love to fish, shore fishing gets the nod most the time so nobody gets left out. We're super lucky to have such good spots  in our back yard. Keep the kids happy, and everyone else will be happy too! lol   Your welcome!!! It's fun fishing with the kids (no egos to deal with!) hehehe    Some seasons are better then others, and it changes every year. But at the end of each year it always averages out and ends as a great year.    It was tough RC, but mainly because I worked alot more then previous years. We still managed some really good fish however. The water was really low all year, and it made it really tough to track down active fish constantly  (walleye). Bass numbers were insane right from ice out to late fall, but very few fish this year around the 5lb mark (which are giants around these parts). Seen alot more musky this year too, which is pretty exciting!   "
