749695,TJQ,2012-12-06 20:42:00,7806,Doing a little research for an Ice Fishing Client of mine!! (Multiple choices are ok!!)
749700,aplumma,2012-12-06 20:51:00,6896,Black orange and white 1/16 jigs. The closest I come to ice fishing is fall Crappie fishing Down here we don't have safe ice.     Art
749704,Christopheraaron,2012-12-06 20:58:00,3525, I'm guessing ice
749715,TJQ,2012-12-06 21:19:00,7806,Summer or winter.. just your first thoughts..
749717,Billy Bob,2012-12-06 21:25:00,5865,It all depends on what species you are targeting and what the WATER TEMP is...and of course water depth   Walleye...once they starting eating bugs and crayfish...ALL BLACK...mostly 1/8 oz.  Smallmouth Bass....see above  Crappie......usually chartreuse or white....1/32oz or 1/16 if I'm in them heavy.  Almost always using 4# mono line on a 6' LIGHT spinning rod.
749736,Rich,2012-12-06 22:35:00,3927,Definitely species dependant for me
749758,Joeytier,2012-12-06 23:47:00,3990,1/8 oz [will rarely go over 1/4 oz] WHITE
749760,Bernie,2012-12-07 00:03:00,3190,"Glow in the dark pink and white, but that wasn't a choice."
749768,fishindevil,2012-12-07 00:42:00,6254,1/8 and 1/4  but will use 3/8 for the current and in spring 5/8 for the mighty Ottawa river !!  and black or white heads for lake trout and orange or chart for eyes and crappies !!!!
749815,Ron,2012-12-07 03:13:00,1683,I use em all right from 1/64oz to 3/8oz. All colors too.
749827,Rich,2012-12-07 04:09:00,3927,Wait a minute.. where's the PINK?
749828,TJQ,2012-12-07 04:16:00,7806, Good point...
749916,TJQ,2012-12-07 16:38:00,7806,What about airplane or teardrop jigs??
749921,Rich,2012-12-07 16:42:00,3927,"Airplane jigs exclusively, chartreuse, for pike through ice. I have one permanently tied on my windlass."
749929,Moosebunk,2012-12-07 16:50:00,3970,"White, black, pink, chartreuse, orange.  Pike liking the orange/white.  Trout pink/white/black.  Walleye chart/black/pink... that's my experience anwyays.  1/4oz most often.  3/8 in the dirty, deep and fast. 1/8 for sparse weed weedlines."
749933,TJQ,2012-12-07 17:05:00,7806, What size??? 1/8 or 1/4???
749938,Roy,2012-12-07 17:10:00,13728,"Voted. black, white, chartreuse and yellow in 1/4 and 3/8."
749939,Rod Caster,2012-12-07 17:11:00,5784,I'm the only one with blue jigs. I bought some a Gramps with silver flecks and they've done really well. Very unique color combos with blue jig heads... And don't fish see blue really well?
749950,Old Man,2012-12-07 17:29:00,822,When fishing for walleye on our lake my order of preference is:  1 - pink 2 - white 3 - yellow 4 - orange 5 - green  1/4 oz generally but will use 3/8 oz as well.
749958,Billy Bob,2012-12-07 18:03:00,5865, I prefer the bullet shaped jigs I pour myself...similar to these moulds...  http://www.cabelas.com/product/Do-it-Darter-Jig-Mold/743505.uts?Ntk=AllProducts&searchPath=%2Fcatalog%2Fsearch.cmd%3Fform_state%3DsearchForm%26N%3D0%26fsch%3Dtrue%26Ntk%3DAllProducts%26Ntt%3Djig%2Bmoulds%26WTz_l%3DHeader%25253BSearch-All%2BProducts&Ntt=jig+moulds&WTz_l=Header%253BSearch-All+Products
750000,jimmer,2012-12-07 20:48:00,2730,"Pink head and white body hands down. 1/16oz - 1/4oz depending on the conditions, depth and structure. That's for gamefish."
750146,singingdog,2012-12-08 12:18:00,1047,"Question is too broad. I use everything from 1/16 oz jigs for trout to 1 oz jigs for musky and deep lakers. Colours? Pink, white, green, brown, black, olive......and then there are all the mixed colours."
750149,Rich,2012-12-08 12:20:00,3927,1/4 90% of the time
750166,aplumma,2012-12-08 14:18:00,6896,The question is what size and colors do you use the most of . It is to help someone adjust inventory so he has a better chance of having what the masses want on hand. There is no wrong answers here.   Art
