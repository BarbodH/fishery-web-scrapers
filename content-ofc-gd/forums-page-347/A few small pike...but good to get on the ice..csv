Well.....not quite tropical....but definitely warmer and less snowy than is normal for this time of year.  Anyway....got onto the ice for an hour and a bit this afternoon, a good 8"" of ice on the small lake i went to, lots of little pike but no walleye. Certainly beats thinking about how i cant ride my new snowmobile!   The ice was BOOOMING today....watched as cracks appeared right under my feet....scary as hell....but fun too.  So...ice season is on from here on out....temps look set to resume normal service from now on....still not much snow in the forecast....but there should be enough on the lakes for slider and cooling purposes by this time next week.      WAS GREAT TO GET BACK ON THE ICE   <iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/sX_ThpY-xjM"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>         "

750120,Muskieman,2012-12-08 04:30:00,2472,"Can't wait ... + 6 here today , all ice is gone ... Dang"
750124,danc,2012-12-08 05:39:00,4677,"You had a better day than I did in Dryden Simon. Went to fix the boiler venting at the new school and was told by Mr. maintenance manager that if I didn't have a gas fitters ticket, I couldn't touch it. Apparently he has one. So I said see ya. Told him that you could get a gas fitters ticket in a Cracker Jack box. Started packing my tools and then he begged me to do the fix. Bottom line, I tightened a few hose clamps and all is good now.  Oh. And congrats on the Pike. Did you get the maps installed?"
750125,manitoubass2,2012-12-08 05:47:00,11391,Sweet dood! This gets me amped!!!

750170,Blue Lk,2012-12-08 14:36:00,337,"Simon,you mentioned the ice was ""booming"" in your post. I spend the winters about 200yds from Eagle Lk (just across the road),was out for a smoke  on the deck last night & the ice was screaming,the forcast looks good for making some decent ice."
750171,limeyangler,2012-12-08 14:38:00,5204, It was kinda cool listening to the Goon here last night too. In bed listening to the ice boom in the dark is awesome.....I LOVE LIVING HERE!

750281,Joey,2012-12-08 22:34:00,9122,"That's just mean Simon   .  I can see you being grumpy cause you can't ride your new sled, but c'mon, you're killing me here"
750283,Terry,2012-12-08 22:39:00,14456,"I think he is kidding us there, there is not ice in Ontario   great to see people getting out but it hurts"
