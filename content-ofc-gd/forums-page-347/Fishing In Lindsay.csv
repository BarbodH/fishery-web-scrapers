301279,Freshtrax,2009-02-04 13:14:00,2215,monster pike ..lake dalrymple... sturgon lake..used to have good pickrel fishing..not so sure any more.. scugog river has LUNKER largemouth and musky
301401,ciceri,2009-02-04 20:21:00,535," yup!!     i got a few pics of bass to, 4 pound plusers."
301426,MCTFisher9120,2009-02-04 21:30:00,3761," I'm not sure about the river but Lake Scugog in port perry had some very decent bass fishing, with my snakes and jigs i caught 4 nice bass(2 on each) I think the weights were 2.8, 2.6, 2.7, and a 3ld'r...witch in my opinion was pretty good for shore fishing in port perry lol. I would love to fish the river!  But i did work for those fish, i had at least six times walking the shores where i would only get a single bite or nothing at all"
301447,ciceri,2009-02-04 22:15:00,535," I'll let you in on something for fishing scugog river on shore, POPPERS ARE YOUR BESTFRIEND!!!! haha"
301451,MCTFisher9120,2009-02-04 22:33:00,3761, good to know
303952,MCTFisher9120,2009-02-09 21:17:00,3761,"Cool thanks for the info, i'm sure people there will be into fishing and i will be able to get some first hand info on where to fish, im 99.9% sure i am going to Lindsay-Fleming College now.  Thanks again"
749592,troutadrenolin,2012-12-06 06:55:00,2,hey i was wondering the same thing is there a good spot around this time of the year for musky or anything i just wanna catch a fish in lindsay its been a wile
749593,Garfisher,2012-12-06 07:25:00,229,I honestly doubt you would get anything in the river at this time of the year. Your best bet may be to wait until the ice comes unless you have access to a boat. I'm sure you could find some panfish or even the odd bass or muskie on Lake Scugog.
749595,troutadrenolin,2012-12-06 08:20:00,2, heyy can u show me some good spots around lindsay
749609,Acountdeleted,2012-12-06 12:03:00,2562,"  First off, Congradulations. Second, you will love the course. I took 3 years and it was fantastic. A lot of really passionate teachers who love what they do.  I've seen some big bass come out of the scugog river. Thats your best bet. If you can drive, there are a few good shoreline spots on Sturgeon Lake and a few really good spots at Pigeon. Good luck!"
749611,Roy,2012-12-06 12:11:00,13728,"This thread is almost 4 years old. But yeah...congrats again, Mike."
749687,super dave,2012-12-06 19:14:00,323,"  Not sure if you'll get this post Spooled but I canoed into Emily lake from the top end and it was a big disappointment fishing wise, but a great day for a paddle with the father in law.  we decided to go downstream and take out at the road which was much closer but it looked like someone had filled it in and we were not able to reach the road even though it was only 50 yards away.  very frustrating, especially when you're starving."
300275,MCTFisher9120,2009-02-02 00:11:00,3761,Old thread...
300276,SBCregal,2009-02-02 00:12:00,688,congratulations on getting into school  not sure about the area though.
300282,Big Cliff,2009-02-02 00:20:00,6899,"First congratulations!  Second, give me a call when you get settled in and I'll show you plenty of places to fish in the area. 328-0750"
300286,MCTFisher9120,2009-02-02 00:22:00,3761, Page Bookmarked. Thanks for the info.
300290,Rizzo,2009-02-02 00:29:00,4754,if you drop one of your classes and take the refund you could afford a little fishing boat and have time to use it(not that I would recommend such an action )
300292,ciceri,2009-02-02 00:30:00,535,theres trails around the school that lead to the river.
300309,Radnine,2009-02-02 01:14:00,1538,Hey!! Congratulations Mike!! That's great news. I know squat about fishing in that area but it sounds like Cliff will take care of you. Which course did you finish up deciding on? Jim
300314,brandon,2009-02-02 01:30:00,857,congrats man....what program did you get into?  theres a bunch of us fish and wildlife grads kickin around here...i'm sure you'll get some good info on places to fish.  I had most of my luck just in the river.....or make friends with somebody with a truck/boat and hit simcoe or scugog
300315,danbouck,2009-02-02 01:33:00,4380,No idea where to fish but congrats!
300316,MCTFisher9120,2009-02-02 01:34:00,3761," I got into the Fish & Wildlife Technology program! I want to take a additional college course after this, but i'll make that decision once i need to."
300327,Ron,2009-02-02 02:05:00,1683,You will have to speak with Marc Newall. See if you can't volunteer with the Muskie rearing program. Tell him Ron Reyns sent ya.  When do you start your courses? I fish for Muskie up in that neck of the woods often and we could always hook up.
300339,ciceri,2009-02-02 02:16:00,535," record low of muskie caught for me on the river last season, it was weird."
300345,steverowbotham,2009-02-02 02:34:00,1800,"There's lots of good fishin around ... scugog, scugog river, sturgeon lake"
300500,Zubris21,2009-02-02 15:16:00,563,"congratulations on getting accepted.  It's a great feeling!  Don't know anything about fishing in the area, but I'll check in with my buddy who graduated from that same program a couple years ago.  I'm sure you will meet a few like minded (fish-minded) folks through your program to go out adventuring with!"
300638,Photoz,2009-02-02 22:30:00,792,"I guess we'll teach him how to catch carp, eh Cliff? (Ya know any good spots?)"
300723,chickenhawk,2009-02-03 00:46:00,612,"if i'm there, i can show you some spots for steelhead and salmon, i also know of a couple brookie streams, i got accepted to fleming too for the fall semester, jus not sure if that is where i am going to end up.....but when you move up there.....put up a post and we can maybe get togetther for some fishin.....   Hawk"
300729,holdfast,2009-02-03 01:05:00,1813,seems Fishing Canada did a Brooktrout fishing in the Lindsay area.  I believe it was the Little fella Pete Bowman.  Get yourself some Topo maps and explore.
300791,JeffBornFishin,2009-02-03 02:32:00,260,Sounds like an interesting program...a good choice.  Here is a link to the program for any one else that is curious.  http://www.flemingc.on.ca/index.cfm/go/pro.../cstrm/1099.cfm  There is also an interesting video with respect to a Musky project.  SSFC Frost campus sure has changed since I spent time working there back in '94.  Where does the time go?  Enjoy your time there as it goes by real fast!  If you have a set of wheels there are endless fishing spots in the area.
300797,Joeytier,2009-02-03 02:37:00,3990,"The locks right in downtown Lindsay can be decent if you're willing to rub shoulders with guys.  I remember when I was 12 or so, I went down having never caught much in the way of walleye before and hooked two right off the bat."
301016,jediangler,2009-02-03 19:06:00,1923,"Caught my first musky in the Scugog river in Lindsay when I was 12 yrs old. It was where the old railway bridge crossed the river. The locks are your best bet right in town for walleye. You are within an hours drive of any of the Kawartha lakes so keep your priorities in line. When my Bro, Joonmoon, went to the college he spent too much time fishing and not enough time studying."
301022,joonmoon,2009-02-03 20:06:00,528,"Ya ya ya  I know I know..  .The locks are right in town and the river will hold lots of fish all year. Mind the regs as the season closes early in the fall. When school starts get your books and your kits and register and all that. Then get down to the river and explore, lots of decent water to fish. Look up Big Cliff, you won't be disappointed. Good luck with school, you won't need luck to fish."
301023,ciceri,2009-02-03 20:06:00,535," theres spots to catch steelhead, salmon, and brook trout in Lindsay? Would you have to drive there, or is it like biking distance from town or....?"
301064,scugpg,2009-02-03 22:53:00,1373," Hey did Mark used to teach at I.E. Weldon?  Try fishing at east or west creek just outside of Lindsay, always had decent luck there.  Side note - has anyone fished Emily lake near Dunsford?"
301067,steverowbotham,2009-02-03 23:01:00,1800,"You've got to drive for salmon and steelies ... but bowmanville, port hope, oshawa, pickering etc.... really arent that far, and there's always students making the trip... trust me"
301149,chickenhawk,2009-02-04 01:52:00,612,yeah there's always someone headed to Lake O tribs.....other than that there is lots of brookies around the Lindsay area....in the winter Lake Scugog is close by as well as Gull Lake is about a 45 minute drive from Lindsay.....i think Lake Simcoe is not far either.....not sure tho....you will have to check that out
