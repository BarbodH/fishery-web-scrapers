750499,davey buoy,2012-12-09 20:26:00,5505,Hard to believe the pigeons can't see the fish that close to them. There some smart fish!!
750516,Leecher,2012-12-09 21:11:00,7832, I find this fascinating the way they adapted to this new way of eating
750518,Christopheraaron,2012-12-09 21:15:00,3525,Cool! Those pigeons must be pretty strong to get free...
750519,davey buoy,2012-12-09 21:17:00,5505,Kinda reminds me of the killer whales and the seals.
750520,Handlebarz,2012-12-09 21:18:00,3790,Cool to see that cat fish act just like any other cat stalking a bird
750561,Leecher,2012-12-09 23:42:00,7832, I think their lucky to get away   Yep... they'll beach them selves to get to the food   Very true Mike!
750562,Christopheraaron,2012-12-09 23:43:00,3525,Live target pigeon?
750636,Leecher,2012-12-10 03:49:00,7832, Could very well be Christopher   Only thing missing is the treble hooks
750746,Marko,2012-12-10 17:13:00,854,Size 4.0 circle hook with half of a chicken hanging off of it or a 3lb sucker Get the camera ready too lol. Catfish have been around for thousands of years...i think they adapt well hahah.
750767,iFish4real,2012-12-10 18:13:00,386,"mu grandpa was telling me stories about fishing for big cat fish, back in Europe, tying up the line with a big hook to a duckling and let it swim  I don't think cat fish are very smart, they just go for pretty much anything  killer whales yes, very very smart here's a little video if you haven't seen the whole documentary ""Orca killing school""  "
