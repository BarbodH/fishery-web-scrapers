Been busy at it and didn't get to fish as much as I should of but still had a great year, now time to get some Perch for the freezer too soon  The first trips out like every year were some Pike fishing with my good buddy. Fishing wasn't even close to as good as last seasons opening day Pike but we still caught a good pair of fish I remember. One bite me while rolling a spinnerbait behind the boat.    Here's Rick with another decent fish   Not to long after Pike opener I was on my way to New York to fish Chautauqua Lake with a awesome group of people. The trip was handed down from the boss to me this spring, I got to head on a trip with the Shimano reps and higher staff, a few sponsored pro's like JP DeRose and Simon Frost to name a pair as well as a few store owners from shops across Ontario. It was the most fun I think I've had and I learned lot's from these guys. Pro's really are good at they do and they all fish so differently, really something everybody needs to do even as a co-angler in a tournament.  Anyway on to the pic's, I got a temp license and was able to fish for Smallies as part of there catch & release season. Water was cold I remember in the 50's so cranks, jerkbaits, dropshot ruled the fishing there.  Got to fish with Dave on afternoon 1 in the rain. Showed me how to fish a senko a million ways haha, here's a nice smallmouth   Showing off a largie   Day two I got to fish with jp and blake. Here's blake with a tank smallie   Myself with a decent one   Nik with a 6lb smallie on the dropshot.   One for me   And another, this one was bigger haha. Came from 8ft of water   Next and last day of that trip. Here was the departure the next morning...pumped as hell   PB smallie for me, have to credit some of it to JP  couldn't thank them enough for having me on this trip, I had a blast , the product testing was fun too:P   After that I was busy as hell as gear was coming through then but made it out to Sturgeon twice with friends from work. We fished in the wind the one day and the rain the other. Nothing but small smallies the entire time. I wasn't controlling the boat or pounding docks but man didn't figure much out then.  Later in the summer we made our trip out east for a short week this time around. And after a dry hot summer I picked the week when it rained every single day haha. Kept the temps down but it was a touch bite some of the time when the storms were coming through.  Double header first pair   Little brother chillin in the downpours   Cranking the rocks and kept catching snot rocket's. Fun fight in 20FOW tho   The shore fishing off the campsite is awesome to say the least. Here's my dad   Chunky fish using the 4-stroke as a trolling motor pitching plastics  Still at Kesagami in my mind I think I was   Threw that fish back then worked the stretch another 10' and found this near 4   Froggin at the parking lot   Here's the young one with a nice topwater fish, have him a 6'8MH to use for the week and he got a few like this. Was proud and so was he   Big largemouth of the week came off the bank in 2FOW. Threw the frog out a mile and this one crushed it, heard the Cumara creek a little but in the fish came     Fun times   Another shore fish   Sunny morning finally, out we went   Fish missed the frog on 3 casts to the same spot, 4th time he took it down. Never swung so hard but nice 4lb fish   Average fish this year it seemed   Crankbait Pike   The last morning of the trip was a fun one. I went with my uncle and little brother. Here's a big chunky largie I got off the start   My uncle caught a nice bass after that and then we had no luck for awhile...I was frogging this stretch and this fish just made a wake like ive never seen and took my 1/2oz bait down. I had 60lb braid spooled this year so heavier than my 50from last year. I pulled back and this fish came at us in a hurry. I didn't feel it's weight until the last bit of the fight, the pad edge is 6ft deep and this fish pulled straight to bottom about 3 times and the flex in the rod and me leaning brought it up, did the death roll then I grabbed it.   That frog was down it's throat and the line was around 3 or 4 teeth. Didn't fray. Kudos to Sunline FX2 froggin braid, cast's awesome has barely any color loss and just was a hit for me this year in the 50lb and 60lb.  One last bass and the trip was soon over   On to work now and September wasn't far away   I rented a cottage for a few days and got to fish during a cooler time of year. The frog went away and out came the 1/2oz t-rigged plastics, shakyhead's, tubes anddirty senkos. Fishing was slow, just had to fish lot's of water between bites but enjoyed the time I spent up there. Going for a week next year in September I think.  Action shot bringing in a small largie, mom was quick on the camera haha     Little Pike   Double header   Another nice bass   Went over to the shore spot for a fish with the Senko since the cover had moved out and got one bite   Working the pads seemed to be key, held the heat a bit and was only cover around  1 small bass  2 small bass  3 small bass   Got out for a few hours on the last morning and it was cold out. Worked 2 points with a jerkbait and a tube, then went over to some shoreline with pads in 6 and 8ft...worked a senko on a mile long cast. Was a 1 bite morning, produced a awesome largemouth. Got the net out, fish was ice cold...was a nice taste of fall fishing. Excited to do it a little more next year   Next season is going to be a blast. I am planning a trip with some friends to head to hopefully a fly in lodge next spring, a 2 week camping trip in August over the teaser this summer and more time in the fall  Thanks for having a look, really makes you miss the boat and the quiet out on the water    Now time for some water to freeze up, its Perch time MTBF"
