I tend to use the nickel and gold finish, but I have a few others that work.  My all-time favorite perch jig.  I use it with various Gulp products with excellent results.  Biggest problem can be finding them."

I like the perch pattern ones with the bright red-orange dot under the neck, straight silver, or there's a perch stripe pattern with gold plating. I only am refering to the vertical drop jigs with the chain at the bottom, not the other Hali's.  I know a guy in Toronto that has tons, but ya they are hard to find.  I also buy em when I find em"
