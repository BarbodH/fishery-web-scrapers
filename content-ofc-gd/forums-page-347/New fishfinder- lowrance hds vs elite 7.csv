I was looking to upgrade and have been reading alot about the new lowrance series. My question is comparing the new elite 7 vs the hds gen 2 series 7 or 8. I now its tough to compare a product that hasn't been released yet, but the questions arises as cabelas has a decent offer on the 7.  http://www.cabelas.com/product/Lowrance-HDS-7-Gen-2-Base-Kit/1436950.uts?Ntk=AllProducts&searchPath=%2Fcatalog%2Fsearch%2F%3FN%3D%26No%3D40%26Ntk%3DAllProducts%26Ntt%3Dlowrance%26Ntx%3Dmode%252Bmatchallpartial%26WTz_l%3DHeader%253BSearch-All%2BProducts%26WTz_st%3D%26WTz_stype%3DSP%26form_state%3DsearchForm%26recordsPerPage%3D20%26search%3Dlowrance%26searchTypeByFilter%3DAllProducts&Ntt=lowrance&WTz_l=Header%3BSearch-All+Products  In reading about the new elite 7 http://www.lowrance.com/en-US/Products/Fishfinder-Chartplotter/Elite-7-Broadband-en-us.aspx  The elite 7, form what I can see is basically the same for quality and power, both having 250 rms and actually a high quality screen with 800 x600 pixels, and the elite 7 has broadband technology. I usually fish lake o with a little georgian bay and sinclair thrown in. So I don't need the hds for the net working capibilties of the hds series, so what do you think?"
750677,ecmilley,2012-12-10 12:51:00,2163,"it look like the elite is really just a gen1 hds minus a couple features, if that will do the job go for it"
750681,Lunker777,2012-12-10 13:17:00,866,I have been thinking about trading my two HDS7 for a new Elite 7.... I'm told it uses the same plugs for sonar and power so it would be a pretty easy swap.  I would like to get the DI w/o having to buy the LSS unit. I don't want to drill more holes in my boat if I don't have to ! haha
750688,Roy,2012-12-10 13:39:00,13728,It'd be good to also check out the Elite's compatibility with the charts you now have as well.  I kinda like to have a unit on the market for 6 months to a year before I buy.
750930,moemoe,2012-12-11 02:20:00,352,"the most appealing part for me is the broadband sounder for deep water kings, I am hoping there is higher quality, less interfernce"
750951,craigdritchie,2012-12-11 03:42:00,1586,Consider HDS Gen 2 touch screens as well. More info in this thread.
