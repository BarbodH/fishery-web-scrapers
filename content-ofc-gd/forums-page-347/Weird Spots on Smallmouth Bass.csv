749207,GreenCanada,2012-12-04 16:32:00,375,"I just came across this short album (4 pics) of a smallmouth bass someone caught recently in the United States. I was intrigued by the size and colouration of the spots, but came across an article that talks about what the spots might be. Hopefully, this is of some interest to folks here, so I wonder, have any of you come across something similar? Care to share some pictures of other weird/unique occurrences?

749213,darsky,2012-12-04 17:04:00,586,I get bass like that every late fall. Its a cold water thing
749219,Walleye'm Fishing,2012-12-04 17:16:00,310,I saw someone post an Algonquin report on another fishing forum and he caught a walleye that had those exact markings. I'm also curious to know what they are. The fishing report in question was at the end of June so the water wouldn't have been that cold...
749221,Rod Caster,2012-12-04 17:19:00,5784,Looks like a bad felt-marker prank to me
749228,NAW,2012-12-04 17:43:00,4022,I've seen it before on catfish out of Simcoe.  
749233,bigugli,2012-12-04 17:58:00,6138,Seen it before on mudcats
749240,randaller19,2012-12-04 18:38:00,2,I have seen this a few times. We caught some Smallmouth in Simoce this fall with smaller black markings on them. I have also caught a few out of the Otonabee River in Peterborough. It didn't seem to hurt the fish in any way. Its a bit odd though. 
749305,misfish,2012-12-04 23:48:00,29133,"I know there was a thread here years ago about this. There was an answer. I have been searching,but to no avail."
749363,NAW,2012-12-05 01:47:00,4022,I posted something about black spots on catfish from the Holland River..  But there was no real solid answer as to what was causing it.  Not sure if that's the one your looking for Brian?  http://ontariofishingcommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=56586&st=0&p=617589&hl=catfish&fromsearch=1entry617589
749370,ChrisK,2012-12-05 03:05:00,2772,I've caught smallies out of Long Point Bay that had that black coloration on them and that was about 25 years ago.
749372,solopaddler,2012-12-05 03:14:00,8605,"A couple of viable theories.  One it's possible the blotches may be associated with catch and release fishing. They may be affected negatively where they were touched when out of the water and it's part of a skin or slime repairing process.  Second, increased pigmentation in animal tissue is a natural defense mechanism against heavy metals and other contaminants."
749434,SmokestackLightnin,2012-12-05 16:40:00,390,"  Most likely the cause, especially high iron count in the water."
749440,darsky,2012-12-05 17:09:00,586,"  All possible. However, I personally have been on smallies from June to late Nov for many years now and I see these markings on St Lawrence bass EVERY late Fall and I have no memories of this occurance during warm water periods. Leads me to form a cold water conclusion."
749602,Rich,2012-12-06 11:12:00,3927,"I've caught largemouth with those spots as well, usually in very cold water. I think it may be a form of fishy frostbite... At least thats what my grandpa told me."
749631,Rizzo,2012-12-06 13:50:00,4754,they are wannabe barracudas! Can you blame them? Mr barracuda is tough as nails and pretty cool looking with his black spots
749669,outllaw,2012-12-06 17:15:00,1232,pigmentation is genetic normally.
749692,Acountdeleted,2012-12-06 20:37:00,2562, that looks like a cuckoo catfish released from somebodies cichlid aquarium...
749694,jimmer,2012-12-06 20:42:00,2730,Have seen it on largemouths and I think that I head it comes and goes.
749747,richyb,2012-12-06 23:05:00,774,He wanted to be a peacock bass !
