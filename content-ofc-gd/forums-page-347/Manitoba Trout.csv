749036,troutologist,2012-12-03 20:32:00,951,"I got out after some stocked trout this weekend on 6"" of ice! Glad to be back on the hard water and really proud of this brown trout...my best by far.  Also had a chance to do some experimenting with the new style of ice reel out on the market, boy its just like centerpin fishing, when these trout get hooked they run and its a blast. About as close as you get to pinning for bows and browns on the prairies!  Anyways a little primer for you folks, take care on the ice and do your best to exercise caution and patience as things freeze up.    "
749040,GreenCanada,2012-12-03 20:56:00,375,Interesting setup and awesome looking brown!
749041,davey buoy,2012-12-03 20:59:00,5505,"Nice brown,but kinda liking the reel!!!. What make and model if you don't mind."
749042,troutologist,2012-12-03 21:00:00,951,  Thanks! Its an Ice Spooler by Clam.
749044,Spiel,2012-12-03 21:04:00,9065,"A couple of sweet fish Jay.  Certainly leaves me hoping I get on the ice this year, been too long!  "
749046,craigdritchie,2012-12-03 21:31:00,1586,Sweet looking broon. But six inches of ice already? Gaaaaaaa! This is why I don't live in Manitoba!  Spring won't get here soon enough.
749048,misfish,2012-12-03 21:38:00,29133,Nice looking brown. That reel have a drag system?
749049,troutologist,2012-12-03 21:44:00,951,"It does have a drag system, but it is fairly light, I believe mostly designed for panfishing. I backed it right off and did my best to keep up with these bullets."
749051,misfish,2012-12-03 22:08:00,29133,Thanks Jay.
749069,Joeytier,2012-12-03 22:40:00,3990,"Amazing!   I also use a small fly reel for the troots and perch round here...super fun stuff.  A 16""er could bust yer knuckles easy!"
749079,fishindevil,2012-12-03 23:17:00,6254,"Great lookin brown hay !!! Wicked color on it for sure,and a very cool looking reel too !!!! Thanks for sharing wish I was there too they have snow !!! Lol"
749080,kickingfrog,2012-12-03 23:19:00,8333,I never thought about it much but I never would have though there were browns in lakes in Manatoba. Nice fish.
749084,FisherJuli,2012-12-03 23:29:00,125,Very nice fish- and it's cool to see that much ice already! I'm inspired... Bring on the freeze!! :-)
749089,Joeytier,2012-12-03 23:57:00,3990,"Like rainbows, browns and tigers have been stocked in many, many pot lakes all throughout north America."
749111,troutologist,2012-12-04 01:16:00,951,"Ya not exactly what you think about in MB, a program called FLIPPR is responsible for creating a world class still water trout fishery in the western portion of the province. Lots of hard work goes into keeping these lakes viable for trout (e.g. aeration)"
749119,Walleye'm Fishing,2012-12-04 01:58:00,310,What a beautiful specimen and through the ice to boot.
749126,bare foot wader,2012-12-04 02:20:00,1354,"beauty brown! well done  I picked up on using fly reels for some ice jigging a few years back, nearly eliminates line twist and plus it's just fun to fish with, pretty popular in the US  if you're into it, check out the 13 fishing multiplier ice reel  http://www.idofishing.com/forum/showflat.php/Number/1181592/fpart/1/13-fishing-6061-multiplier-reel-photos"
749142,Nipfisher,2012-12-04 03:52:00,2449,"Real nice trout through the ice Jay. I have two models of reels that are similar to the clam reel you showed although not as pretty. I started using a Micro Ice reel made by HT about 6 years ago but found the spool was too small. Then I found these ""no name"" brand reels and I like them alot more. The drag system is inside the reel and the center button releases the spool much like a fly reel. You can set the drag to full / half / or none by spinning the clickers. They are all composite and don't freeze.      Full drag    Half drag   Free spool "
749188,troutologist,2012-12-04 15:04:00,951,"Interesting reel, this is my first time trying one out and had a blast. It certainly adds to the challenge of fighting the fish."
750084,S.M.05,2012-12-08 02:39:00,145,"Very nice inland brown. Wish we had something like FLIPPR around here(Tripliods, steelhead crosses, tigers, etc.).  I have been planning to take a trip out there with my airmiles for many years now, maybe next yr."
750091,irishfield,2012-12-08 02:56:00,26272,GREAT stuff Jay!
750132,TDunn,2012-12-08 07:42:00,680,Nice jay! Solid brown!
750135,Moosebunk,2012-12-08 08:27:00,3970,"A) Great brown Jay.  Not sure when ya did head out that way, but I don't remember reports from Manitoba from you.  They'll be welcome here man, those fish out there are crazy good lookin'.  Small fly-roddin' reels and the like are becoming more popular I guess.  Little to no line twist, as said.  Will be buying one soon to try out.  C) SMO5... yes Mikey.  I'll go with ya if I have to.  Can we do catfish too though?"
750342,troutologist,2012-12-09 04:10:00,951,"Been out for a few years now...just let me know what you're coming!  Heading out on L Wpg in the truck for the 1st time tomorrow after some greenbacks...can't wait, scouted today and theres a solid 14-16"""
750347,Joey,2012-12-09 05:03:00,9122,"Wow, beautiful brown!  Congrats"
