749910,Bassassins,2012-12-07 16:17:00,111,I am not looking past this ice season - still very excited!  However I have 2 weeks to take for vacation from the 3rd week in march to the end of april.  I would really like to hit the runs down near Port Hope / Cobourg in spring... Would that be possible in that time frame? Which 2 weeks would you take?  Thanks for the advice.  Smooth
749915,Rich,2012-12-07 16:33:00,3927,I'd pick a time when the season is open.. just me though..
749934,Moosebunk,2012-12-07 17:08:00,3970,"Rich makes a good point Rob.   It's kinda too bad that's the choice time of year you have for your vacation.  It can be hit and miss as to what's biting on the valley.  Knowing you're mostly shorebound, I'd think the later the better (safer) for opps with trout and other species."
749935,Reelaction,2012-12-07 17:08:00,33,"My choice would be go early. You may run a higher risk of a washed out river but there should be fewer people around.  And if this spring is like so many others, the best you can hope for at the end of April are tired old dropbacks.  PS. The fewer people that realize there are stealhead opportunities before the end of April opener the better"
749936,BillM,2012-12-07 17:09:00,17367, Might wanna read those regs a bit closer.  Parts of that river are open all year.
749941,Nipfisher,2012-12-07 17:13:00,2449,Lots of pike fishing options.
749943,Rich,2012-12-07 17:16:00,3927,"I meant for more options to fish than the few open areas. Its nice when you have the whole river as an option. I misworded my reply, my bad."
749969,Bassassins,2012-12-07 18:36:00,111,See I am learning something already - really wish I would have taken a week this fall to go down.  Will see if there is anything else available for spring..... Thanks guys.  Smooth
750019,esoxansteel,2012-12-07 22:31:00,1307,"If you want to fish more areas, then you have to take the end of your holiday time in late April, if you can take the first week in May id do that two. last year pickings were slim by the last week of March in the lower stretches, with the bigger runs coming 2 weeks earlier, but again your fishing from the SOUTH side of the CNR bridge to the lake, which some people just cant read the Regs, and prefer to poach and harvest steelhead under the bridge."
750534,msp,2012-12-09 22:37:00,1336,Early to mid March is prime time on the north shore of Lake Ontario for steelhead. Lots of options too. All the rivers should be prime.
750538,solopaddler,2012-12-09 22:42:00,8605,The earlier the better. March is one of the best months of the year for steelheading.
750545,Christopheraaron,2012-12-09 23:02:00,3525," If you want to fish only the mouth of the ganny then go ahead, but that doesn't sound like much fun."
