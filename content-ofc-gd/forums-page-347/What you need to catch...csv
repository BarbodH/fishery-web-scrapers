749900,Billy Bob,2012-12-07 15:39:00,5865,Real Fishermen catch fish.....not gadgets.....
749913,Rich,2012-12-07 16:26:00,3927,"So if all that gear is necessary WOW ive been lucking out for spring carp for 20 years now! I mean, i need a slingshot, landing net, mat, specialized holders, feeder rigs, boilies, flavored maize.. but SOMEHOW those technical savvy carp have been hitting hooks and corn all these years!"
749920,BucktownAngler,2012-12-07 16:41:00,582,youre the sucker with tens of thousands worth of gear when corn & a hook have been working for 20 years   what point are you still trying to make here?
749922,Rich,2012-12-07 16:43:00,3927,"That it's not necessary. That it's your preference how you do it. My point hasn't changed, nor has people's lack of understanding."
749924,BucktownAngler,2012-12-07 16:46:00,582," so if its our preference how we do it, why are you telling people what they do or do not need?  pot calling the kettle black"
749925,Rich,2012-12-07 16:47:00,3927,"I think corporate sponsorship may be standing between communication barriers here. So believe the hype, or believe real people, or figure it out for yourself, or continuously spend your time pissing people off on internet forums. It's your life ( a pretty sad one if thats your hobby) but - lifestyle is also your preference. Thats the fun of life."
749926,Rich,2012-12-07 16:49:00,3927,"Now i'll go live my life, and others will continue wasting theirs with moronic replies."
748982,azebra,2012-12-03 16:32:00,168,"well, his walmart line get as stiff as a... board this time of year. his drag cant hold anything over 2 lbs and he mentions he feels more and can cast further. and has more confidents..."
748984,azebra,2012-12-03 16:43:00,168,"I remember a time many years back, I strung up a good spinning rod and reel the exact same as my girlfriend mickeymouse rod from when she was 9 or 10 years old. well, different line but the same jig.execpt she choose to paint pink nail polish spots on the grub.  as I tested her rod to see if it would cast out, fish on, I cast again, fish on! we then switched rods, and I fished my rod in the same place and manner, nothing hit. but they were all after her mickeymouse line.. so its really all up to the fish on what their going to eat or not. i recall anothre time i was 12 or so, i found a heap of old line tangled in a bush along a lake, it had an old half rusted spoon on it..still have the spoon. i was throwing it in by hand and catching perch and bluegill, there were some guys in a boat a couple hundred feet out, they yelled some good words my way and i felt great to outfish the experts back then, by hand."
748988,Rich,2012-12-03 17:17:00,3927,So if he honed his skills he could catch fish with that rod then.
749003,bare foot wader,2012-12-03 18:03:00,1354," LOl so why have 2 rooms filled with tens of thousands of dollars of gear?   some people like using nice gear, doesn't make them any better or worse than anglers with basic gear"
749004,danbouck,2012-12-03 18:11:00,4380,"If fishing with the bare minimum makes you happy, use it and enjoy it.  If fishing with the best equipment makes you happy, use it and enjoy it.  Read Wayne's signature"
749159,Rich,2012-12-04 12:08:00,3927,"You read that i have 2 rooms full of gear, and stopped there? Pretty sure i've explained myself, and this post more than enough. If you still dont get it, and for some reason feel this is a personal shot at you or a friend, i dont care. You're an incommunicable human being, and i'll have to just hope you smarten up. Peace ."

749174,misfish,2012-12-04 13:54:00,29133, I like QUALITY     AMEN
749182,Steve,2012-12-04 14:28:00,2075,"I'll offer a different view.  buy quality equipment - but use it!  rods and reels can be used for more than one purpose.  I'm quite confident that the fishing I do would destroy ""average"" gear.  However, if the reels I use work for three or four different types of fishing/species, it can be justified that much easier.  Big water fishing doesn't take kindly to poor drags on reels."
749187,richyb,2012-12-04 14:47:00,774,My biggest trout was landed through the ice with redwolf line and by hand. My biggest bass was landed with a push button reel and a 20$ quantum rod. Biggest pike was on one of those $29.99 shimano combos. Ofcourse that was years ago before I got all of the new fancy gear but the big money combos now havent helped me break my PB's.OH and I almost forgot my PB muskie was caught on a 6' med action rod with 10# mono. I guess I didnt have to buy the 7'med hvy with 50#power pro but atleast now I get most of my snagged lures back when I haul the logs off bottom lol.
749190,bare foot wader,2012-12-04 15:09:00,1354, LOL thanks for the advice
749621,azebra,2012-12-06 13:08:00,168,"i might know this guy related to my family, and he has a workshop/garage larger then his house, full to the shingles with rods, baits, guns, ammo, bows, scopes.. motors boats, probably easily over 100rods, a collection from his youth over 50 years ago...he uses probably 75% of it all throught the year, and when not in use, their great conversaation pieces and eye candy. i even got a 9 year old to cound the treble hooks hanging from the boat.. he stopped at an even 600 lol kids..."
749623,SirCranksalot,2012-12-06 13:15:00,3291,"  Yeah, but did he still want to borrow your good   stuff??"
749627,lew,2012-12-06 13:31:00,12766," I've been fishing for about 60 years.  I have an expensive boat and I tow it with an even more expensive truck.  I use very good rods & reels and my favorite combo is worth $700.  Most of my musky baits are fairly expensive and I have some worth $100  I don't buy anything cheap.  I catch alot of fish.  If that makes me an armchair expert, so be it.  Is there anything wrong with that ??"
749628,Spiel,2012-12-06 13:41:00,9065,What I need to catch fish and what I prefer to use to catch fish are entirely different things.
749637,Rich,2012-12-06 14:16:00,3927,"I cant believe people took offense to this post, really. Dudes are pm'img me some harassing stuff. Didnt mean to insult or offend anyone. Bye ofc, yet again. Grow the heck up."
749641,Rich,2012-12-06 14:26:00,3927, First post. Re-read before freaking out.

749875,Squid,2012-12-07 13:13:00,1656,"Pretty sick people if they are PM'ng you about this thread. I was almost brainwashed into believing that you do need very expensive gear to be a ""good"" fisherman. That is complete horsepoop!! You do not need top end of anything. Its FISHING not CATCHING. If  you want to catch fish then buy a big net or use TNT!! I was fishing with a guy, that is no longer a friend, using a walmart set up that I paid 60 bucks for. He had a Stradic and a Fenwick combo that cost 500 bucks. I clearly remember him saying to me that he could not believe that I was catching fish with that combo!! I out fished him that weekend  I guess for some it is more of a status symbol than anything else."
749886,lew,2012-12-07 14:08:00,12766," Then I spose your $$$$ huge, top-o-the-line,  10"" gps/sonar unit sitting on your consol is just a cardboard replica eh Pete ??   :lol:"
749890,Sinker,2012-12-07 14:25:00,8692,"  There is a big difference between needs, and wants.  Do you really think that big graph catches more fish?? I doubt it. It may help find them, but the angler still has to know how to catch them.  P.S....my little 5"" lowrance will mark the exact same fish as the 10"" screen  S."
749898,Squid,2012-12-07 15:27:00,1656,Yes Lew I was lead to believe that that is what I needed. I would not buy that unit today for those dollars.
749899,Squid,2012-12-07 15:33:00,1656,"I remember clearly back in the day folks advising that we need 130 lb flurocarbon leaders and 80lb braid with a minimum of a shimano compre or st croix rod and a calcutta reel etc... Really, I have one and its nice and all but its not the end all of fishing. I bought it as a gift to myself for my 25 years of marriage. Would I but another one? No way, not worth the money. Guys on St.Clair have been fishing with 65 dollar rods, 50 lb mono and a small selection of baits for years and they still catch monster muskies without all of the expensive gadgets."
747891,sleepjigging,2012-11-30 02:35:00,207,"The more I have learned, the less I bring with me. I used to have a tackle box with a random assortment of ""I better have one of theses"".  I don't have a boat but I wish I had one. I go shore fishing, when the fish come to shore.  I use whatever catches fish. I like using plastics, but there are times that live bait is king.  I readily admit that I don't have the expertise to APPRECIATE high end equipment.  However, if you can go to a spot where there IS fish, and if you can put something in front of the fish that it will eat, the rest is just making sure that the hook stays in its mouth long enough for you to haul it in. Then comes the bragging of the catch to you buddies.  And that is what you need to catch..."
747902,SirCranksalot,2012-11-30 03:44:00,3291,"From the beginning I thought Rich's post was quite tongue in cheek. Even this seemingly innocuous post seem to  get the flaming going!! Long way to spring, folks. In the meantime, chill."
747915,Roy,2012-11-30 04:40:00,13728, Name me one that's weighed in pounds. Unless you're saying that a 3 ounce rod is 0.1875 of a pound.
747917,nlpaintballer,2012-11-30 05:59:00,122,"I don't have much money to spend on fishing, so I try to put it where it counts. St. Croix premier's for my rods, stradic/ci4's for spincast, revo toro's for muskie and currado for baitcast. Not top of the line, but gear I know will last, and will handle early spring to late fall/early winter conditions.  I make my own leaders, spinnerbaits, bucktails, and even carve my own lures to keep costs down. I won't spend over 10.00 on a lure unless it's for muskie, and for years I only bought my spinnerbaits at the fishing show where you could get deals on them. I own a crap load of Rapala's but I don't think I will ever buy a live target lure, especially their frogs.  Don't get me wrong, it is still a sickness because all I fish is pike, muskie, and a little bit of bass, but I still carry 18 large trays stuffed with lures in an XL bass pro bag.....not including my muskie lures. I carry a lot of doubles/triples because it sucks if you are nailing fish with a certain pattern and have no backup if that one gets lost or damaged.  Spending the time on water with someone willing to teach you the techniques is also key, or else you have to do a lot of research followed by trial and error."
747927,Rich,2012-11-30 12:29:00,3927,"They can't chill though, armchair experts must argue, every time fishing information is posted. This makes them feel better about being poor, weekend anglers."
747965,ehg,2012-11-30 14:51:00,2666," Was at Petawawa R. in Algonquin this summer. Caught bass, musky, and channel cats on Rapalas, Live Target, jigs/sassy shads w/worm (no minnows allowed). Couldn't catch a walleye however. Thought about it afterwards and came to conclusion that simple worm, splitshot, and slip bobber setup at night in spots will be used next time. Worm, boobber,sinker simply might be ticket there."
747978,Moosebunk,2012-11-30 15:24:00,3970,"Tend to put less into gear than maybe I could, and more into gas and trips that get me to where the fish are.  Buy more mid-range, good gear.  Know enough people with tonnes of their money invested into expensive or massive amounts of stuff they rarely if ever use.  What they'd have been better off investing in IMO, is actually going fishing.   Won't be taking any NRX's and Stella's to the grave, only life and experiences.    Quit stirring the pot Rich. lol."

There was a member here who is no longer with us, whose sig said ""lures are designed to catch fisherman"". I can't help but think that this has a great deal of merit. I also find that those of us who have other ""hobbies"" that take away some of our disposable income, tend to be more conservative in their approach to gear purchases... I know that I can quite easily walk past a row of rods, reels or lures, but put a nice shinny guitar in front of me and I guarrantee that I will stop, have a look and start gassing! (GAS - Gear Aquistion Syndrom) Gas pains can lower the amount of oxygen available to the normally logical mind.

So we bring everything we own, in case we need that lure/rod...  Sleepy"

Muskie opener a couple years ago was fun, 20km plus and my first time out on a larger lake. Only had an electric at the time, so I got a lot of looks from people wondering what the hell I was doing on Balsam with just a trolling motor in high winds.  Little did they know it was a 74lb thrust.  Lost my first good ski at boat side because I didn't have a net. Went and bought one the same day so I wouldn't have a repeat of this.

747813,aplumma,2012-11-29 22:36:00,6896,It is funny over the years my brother and I have collected a good bit of tackle to fish for pike up North. The majority of the lures were bought not knowing what worked and what didn't. We continued to haul a monstrous amount of lures up North over the years and a pattern began to form and it eliminated about 50% of our stash of lures. We continued to haul the bulk of the lures with the thought that what IF..... we needed THAT ONE to catch fish and low and behold last year it happened the one lure that worked great was the lowly Williams Wobbler. The point is planning the trip and sorting through the tackle sparks the memories of fish caught with this lure and not with that one are priceless. We still carry to much tackle with us but you can bet we have 3 of the really good ones in the box one for me one for Joe and one for our new friend we meet on the water.  Art

I was under the impression you were saying that all  anyone needs are the basics and expensive/lots of gear doesn't help.....  And i made it clear if this wasn't the case that I AGREE with you....  I'm not hating..... Just different opinions...  I feel a rookie should get good gear... And a wide variety of tackle... Then figure out what they like using the best for their location and species of choice....   But that's my opinion....

747593,BucktownAngler,2012-11-28 22:39:00,582,  yes! very true
747596,Rich,2012-11-28 22:45:00,3927, Sometimes it's good to go back to basics is all i intended with the post. The only person I could see being offended by this is a self admitted armchair expert. We all start somewhere.

747607,BucktownAngler,2012-11-28 23:06:00,582,lol these are funny terms.  i dont see how it applies though. thought it refered to people acting tough on the internet?
747614,BillM,2012-11-28 23:16:00,17367," It's pretty ironic you make a thread about 'getting back to basics'  then tell us you've got tens of thousands of dollars wrapped up into gear..   I don't even have close to that amount tied up, including the boat!  LOL!"
747616,Rich,2012-11-28 23:22:00,3927,"Getting back to basics saved my day of steelheading yesterday. It brought this up.  My 3 boats together value into $10,000 range. I rent a 3 bedroom apartment.. 2 bedrooms are ""fishing rooms"" . Lol rods, gear everywhere. More of a weakness than a necessity. I cant go through a fishing aisle without dropping two hundred bucks. Lol much of it is unopened and will likely be donated to future fishathons."

The most important thing in fishing is to go where the fish are. By that, I mean you need knowledge/experience.  Sleepy"
747619,Rich,2012-11-28 23:28:00,3927,"True dat! Whether the experience is 30 years of walking banks or 30 years of bass boats, both know the behaviour of the same fish, the exact same!"

747635,Walleye'm Fishing,2012-11-29 01:22:00,310,"I agree with Rich.  For walleye fishing, I have all kinds of expensive crank baits  that work well but the cheaper lures always outperform 8-15$ lures. Very cheap jigs with inexpensive plastics often yield 20+ walleyes in a few hours of fishing.    For brook trout fishing, I have all kinds of expensive crank baits, spinners, spoons, worm harnesses... This year, I caught 6 brookies over 3 pounds (including a 6 pounder) using a 3 dollar flashing spoon and a worm. "
747638,Joeytier,2012-11-29 01:30:00,3990,"This year, I successfully pared my tackle down to a small, 3 compartment flambeau shoulder pack.  I have everything in it that I could possibly need to effectively fish for the 10 + local species of fish that I actively target throughout the year.  Truly makes you realize how much you can do without and not affect your outcomes."
747662,fishing,2012-11-29 03:15:00,167,"Could not agree with you more, Rich. It's not so much about what you use, it's all about where the active schools of fish are."

I prefer to be with someone else, but I can't seem to find anyone around here that fishes as much as I do (or did..). But I still have lots of fun when I'm alone. And my wife does count because she steers the Sportspal where I want it, freeing me up to focus on casting and retrieving."

A billion tiny split shots. A billion tiny hooks. 9 dollar floats. A $300+ centerpin with an average 5 year learning curve. A purse full of fresh eggs, which have to be taken and frozen very specifically or they are garbage.  What you actually need: a fishing rod, hooks, sinkers, roe or live worms for bait.  Bass  Told: $30,000 + bass boat. Truck to match. Minimum 5 rods, more expensive the better. Thousands of dollars in lures. Livewell, net, push pole, power pole, electric motor. 80lb braided line.  Need: fishing rod, hooks, sinkers, bobbers, minnows or worms - or plastic variations.  Ice fishing  Told: clam flipover hut, sled or quad, truck to get it there. An insane variation of colored jigheads and spoons. Live minnows, waxies, maggots and mousies. A power auger. Deadbait, tip ups, flasher, lcd and underwater camera.  Need: spool of line, hook, bait, auger or spud.  Its all your preference how you do it. Thats the fun of fishing."

747485,ehg,2012-11-28 16:45:00,2666,"Seemed the best 'bow fishing for me was back in the 80's when they had cheap spinning gear. Fresh roe helped. Best bass fishing was from cheap tinny where i wasn't scared to go into shallow, rocky areas.  Getting out fishing was way better than sitting at computer wishing i was fishing."
747498,funfishing,2012-11-28 17:13:00,147," Worms and roe bags do a fine job sinking on their own, and are presented more naturally with the flow of the water without sinkers.  Even you're overestimating the requirements"

747509,bare foot wader,2012-11-28 17:32:00,1354,"  ""army of armchair experts"" is interesting terminology...lol  you can make anything as simple or as complicated as you like...competitive sports for example, carbon sticks, custom skates, advanced nutrition and training, etc, etc...or just a frozen pond, wooden stick, skates and a puck (frozen toes of course)  you get to a certain point or skill level and then you can truly appreciate high end gear IMO...is it needed? no, of course not...does it make you better? sometimes  put me head to head jiggin walleyes with a glx stick and braid vs anybody with an ugly stick and mono and I'd bet money I'd hook more 99% of the time   like you said, personal preference, as long as you're having fun..."
747512,mike rousseau,2012-11-28 17:40:00,4661,  That's fine if you wanna catch the bare minimum available to you....  But there's a lot of gear that really does help you catch more fish....  I don't fish bass and trout but I'm sure someone with a variety of TOOLS to catch fish.... On average.... Will smoke the worm and hook fisherman...  All depends on what you want out of your day fishing.... I'm always trying to learn and get better and catch more fish on a daily basis... I do this for personal reasons... Some its money.... Some just wanna be at the top of the game in their area.... Some wanna eat more fish...  I have a $400+ dollar rod to troll walleye... Could I get by with a $20 rod...yes... But has the $400 dollar rod helped me catch more fish... YES it has... I can feel things with this rod that cheaper rods won't detect....
747517,Headhunter,2012-11-28 18:06:00,5703,"BBR, I went on an ice fishing trip to Nip a few years ago... it was my firt trip to Nip and I was excited as all h e l l to do it! Myself and the other guys who came up, brought countless tackle boxes, numerous rods and you name it, cause we were gonna be ready for what ever we needed to catch fish. I watched the guy who invited us up, use a wooden stick with 20 year old mono tied to the end, a jig and a minnow catch fish after fish, while us tackle junkies just sat there and stared. Now I'm definately not the brightest guy on the planet, but it didn't take me long to realize that if I wanted to catch a fish, I had better copy him. Funny, now when I go up for a weekend, I bring one rod (two if were ice fishing), one tackle tray and have at 'er! KISS works for me! HH"

But the reason I do and will continue to spend on decent equipment is durability. I may catch the same # of fish on the first day with cheap gear, but over it's lifetime I will catch more fish with quality gear. It can cost less to buy something once than replacing it constantly."

747585,Rich,2012-11-28 22:00:00,3927,"First off, i have tens of thousands invested into gear for all species.  But. When a first time ice fisherman is told his first trip, without a vex and a clam hut, he wont catch a dang thing.. he might not ever have a first trip.  Food for thought today.  Ps i catch as many trophy bass in a season from my inflatable as my dad or grandfather ever did in their $65000 bass boats, and many more species they never mastered.  What did they teach me to get me where I am? The basics."
747586,craigdritchie,2012-11-28 22:03:00,1586,"Back in the '70s I took a tour of the Garcia fishing rod factory. Back then, they made four different series of rods. There was the entry-level Blue series, and the more expensive Green series. The Brown series rods were a notch even above that, and provided you had lots of money, you could go all-out and buy the top-of-the-line Black series. They were pretty sexy rods, I must admit.  People swore up and down that the Brown rods and Black rods were worth the considerable extra cost. They had better feel, better balance, and all sorts of other intangible benefits. But after the factory tour, I learned that in reality, they were all the same. The only thing that was different was the colour of dye used on the blank. Handles, hardware, resin and glass cloth were all otherwise absolutely identical.  On a trip to South Korea two years ago, I did a couple of other factory tours. I can tell you that not much has changed.  I always buy good quality equipment, but I am very careful to not get caught up in the marketing hype. You usually get what you pay for - but not always."
