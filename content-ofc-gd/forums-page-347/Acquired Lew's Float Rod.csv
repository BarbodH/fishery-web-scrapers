I got the rod for cheap but knew that Lew's made rod's many years ago and just now were brought back into the fishing industry with new reels so far.  Anyway I wanted to share some pictures of the rod, who know's if I'll ever use it  Here is the info I know, I have been searching all over the net and can't find a value or picture of a similar rod. Hope to get some info on when it was made etc..  Lew's ""SG"" Graphite Speed Stick"" SGN-2116ST 11'6"" Noodle Action Made in Korea 1/16oz-3/8oz 2lb-10lb  Pictures  Handle section   Logo   Once More   First Guide   Model Info   Put together it feels light and fairly crisp. Guessing it's from the 80's or 90's. Really not sure. Hope to hear some info on this one.  Tightlines guys,  MTBF"
750458,lew,2012-12-09 18:44:00,12766,I saw the title of your post Mike and the 1st thing I thought of was that I don't remember selling you anything   :lol:
750461,workwear,2012-12-09 18:53:00,592,i bet it catches alotta muskies................
750468,MCTFisher9120,2012-12-09 19:07:00,3761, lmao
750479,davey buoy,2012-12-09 19:44:00,5505, First thing I thought:P.Lol.
750524,GBW,2012-12-09 21:47:00,8460,"It's old, used and was worth $20 new so I'll give ya $5 for it..."
750525,Rich,2012-12-09 21:49:00,3927,Lew would never use such cheap equipment IMO
750526,GBW,2012-12-09 21:53:00,8460,He hever did if you read the post.  the 'brand' is Lew's....
750536,Rich,2012-12-09 22:40:00,3927,I know. I was continuing with the other humorous posts. Wow. Ofc.
750541,esoxansteel,2012-12-09 22:49:00,1307,"    LMAO I dont think you would use a rod weighted for 2 to 6 pound Lew, a little lite for muskies"
750543,esoxansteel,2012-12-09 23:00:00,1307,"They were out in the late 80s and early 90s, and were distributed by Normark in Oshawa, i did have 2 blanks that I built, one 12fter, and one 11 1/2 fter, bought the blanks for 25.00 each, there was a 13fter that is still sought after to this day, the factory guides looked like fuji hardaloys from the pic, definately not as desirable as a custom built 13ft Lews, but if you got it for a decent price your ahead of the game, if you get LEW to autograph it, the value will go up 10 fold. LOL"
750566,GoneFishin,2012-12-09 23:56:00,349,"Sweet find mike, I always kept my eye out for one. We should go out for crappie next spring I'll bring my cormorant. Nothin like noodlin for crappie haha"
750567,MCTFisher9120,2012-12-09 23:57:00,3761," Ah i see, well I'll probably never use it but its nice to have  haha lews autograph would be great lol"
750568,MCTFisher9120,2012-12-09 23:58:00,3761, sounds like a plan
750570,kingofthesteelhead,2012-12-09 23:59:00,140,"had a 13 ft lew's which i used for about 20 years until a good portion of the tip broke off,was an awesome rod used exclusively for steelhead.Bought it used with a green cardinal 3 on it for $150."
750633,GoneFishin,2012-12-10 03:35:00,349, That combo would get some of the old school float fishermen drooling
750687,GBW,2012-12-10 13:39:00,8460,Never noticed your try at humor.
750726,camillj,2012-12-10 16:02:00,1988,"Heh ... and I was thinkin .. jeeze I can't imagine Lew down-trollin a 10"" Believer behind one of those things ... but I'm sure the fight would be interesting !"
