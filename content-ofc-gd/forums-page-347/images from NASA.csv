749831,NAW,2012-12-07 04:17:00,4022,"I like the last night shot of the entire planet.  It always amazes me the vast areas of black.  Absolutely no pun intended at all.  But Africa has very few clusters of lights large enough to see from space.  Himalayas, South America, etc..  Basically from Northbay up.  So much to explore."
749863,spincast,2012-12-07 10:18:00,3279,very cool. the composite of the world is striking Too bad half of those lights in the big cities are probably on in empty buildings though
749868,whiskywizard,2012-12-07 12:35:00,305," Yup - fascinating.  Look at North Korea. Almost totally black, with a bright band of light along the guarded border."
749878,BillM,2012-12-07 13:19:00,17367,"North Korea, lol."
749889,Roy,2012-12-07 14:16:00,13728,What struck me is North America. The US is ablaze and Canada is lit up for about 100 miles all along the border. Everything else in black except for one light visible in Yellowknife....undoubtedly Dave tying rabbit fur late into the night.
750011,mercman,2012-12-07 21:48:00,7054, LOL !!! I was thinking the exact same thing.
750021,iFish4real,2012-12-07 22:35:00,386," their communist ""Earth Friendly"" program works very well"
750022,iFish4real,2012-12-07 22:38:00,386, that's because 90% of Canadians live within 200km from the border
750031,Roy,2012-12-07 23:22:00,13728," Thanks, I didn't know that. I'm learning all kinds of things here!"
750036,aplumma,2012-12-07 23:39:00,6896,  Check it again tonight Roy I will blink my lights twice at 8:00.   Art
750099,Rich,2012-12-08 03:09:00,3927,Dont go into the light!
