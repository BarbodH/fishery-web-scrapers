750058,Luke V.,2012-12-08 01:05:00,286,So I have had the trolling motor on the back of my tinner for the past few years. After upgrading a couple months ago to a bigger 55lb model with a longer shaft I figured it was time to mount it on the bow. I already have a casting platform in the bow. So why not the trolling motor.  Pics of the platform     Trolling motor mount. I welded it up with some scrap I had around the shop.  Mostly 1 1/2 x 1 1/2 angle iron  Pics        Feel free to ask any questions. I'll let you know how it works in the next few days.  Tight lines. Luke
750060,davey buoy,2012-12-08 01:13:00,5505,That's pretty nifty Luke. Amazing what a little engineering can do. Can't wait to hear your review:good:
750066,workwear,2012-12-08 01:40:00,592,i would love to have that work shop!!!!!  and a very nice weld job there
750068,irishfield,2012-12-08 01:42:00,26272,Nice welds!! .. ran about 100 feet of bead today myself!
750070,Luke V.,2012-12-08 01:46:00,286,Ummmm I'm not so sure those r nice welds.  But thanks! Seems like my schooling payed off for that lol
750072,bare foot wader,2012-12-08 01:51:00,1354,"sharp looking toothpaste welds there....thats how my shop teacher described a good weld, ""looks like tuthpaste son""  great looking setup...boat and shop"
750075,Luke V.,2012-12-08 01:53:00,286,Thanks. Shop is 24x32 inside. Heated and insulated. Makes those longer winter days seem short. I was able to even get cable this summer out here. Oh how I'm spoiled. Lmao
750087,Muskieman,2012-12-08 02:50:00,2472,Good Job ! 
750184,GBW,2012-12-08 15:13:00,8460,great idea and it looks like a good design and job.
750197,Luke V.,2012-12-08 15:54:00,286,"Thanks GBW, Randy  Figure I'll add a little more detail. I didn't want to drill any holes in the hull. So the two upper bolts on each side act as a clamp into the gunnel. The third bolt (bottom) sits just below the gunnle. This prevents it from flyin off if it were to come loose. It also can't slide back because of the angle of the bow. And can't slide forward because of the kleet plate on the bow."
750200,bobkayla,2012-12-08 16:02:00,148,welds look fine to me built to last
750208,chefboi17,2012-12-08 17:05:00,128,"Looks great, I'm planning on building something identical pretty much for my Starcraft. I'm not sure if the 36"" trolling motor shaft will be enough though"
750278,EC1,2012-12-08 22:18:00,930,Nice job there. I've been thinking about doing that to my canoe as well.
750503,Luke V.,2012-12-09 20:38:00,286,"  My boat is a Starcraft SF14. The trolling motor shaft is 39.5"" long. Not sure if that helps you...."
750763,chefboi17,2012-12-10 18:04:00,128,"The pics alone help out greatly, and I'm pretty sure we have almost identical boats, mine is a seafarer sf14"
