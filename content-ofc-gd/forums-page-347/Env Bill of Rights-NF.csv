For example water taking permits, air emissions, dam building etc etc. It allows the public to comment on things that they may not agree with. It's a good way of holding companies with bad track records or with possibly intrusive proposals, including government amendments accountable and in check. Let's say some company is planning on storing waste at a facility near your house....you can send a comment or question like ""will they be collection groundwater samples"" or, ""will they ensure that odours will not be emitted"" to a Ministry which will investigate and/or force amendments to the proposal.   I'm not peddling anything specific here, it's a public service and may be of interest to those who like reading these things. Makes for good lunchtime reading when you've already read everything on OFC.  My link"
