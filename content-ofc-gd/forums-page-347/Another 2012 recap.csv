750723,asdve23rveavwa,2012-12-10 15:48:00,2690,"Good stuff, Chris!!  Too bad we never made it out for some of those smallies!  Hopefully next year!"
749879,Live2fish85,2012-12-07 13:26:00,1633,"Well the season started off with a bumpy start. Had a heart surgery in Dec which was a complete bust, didn’t work but caused complication which had me laying in a hospital bed for a month. Oh well things happen get on right. Well I was out fishing on Lake Simcoe 3 weeks after getting released, not bad since I was told it will be more time before I am recovered haha. I will say it had its times where I was in a lot of pain. I was high on pain pills the hole time just to get past the pain, oh well it is worth it to be fishing. Things got better though and I was back to normal and fishing lots. I’ll will save the words and give what everyone wants, pictures.  Thought this is good for a laugh haha. Minutes before surgery, best thing is the meds they give you haha.    Here ya go,        Some open water,                                                      Hope you enjoy.  Chris     Hope you enjoy.  Chris"

750121,Pikeslayer8,2012-12-08 04:46:00,336,I don't get it Chris.    You have yourself some unsuccessful heart surgery and then turn around and  put a giant beatdown on about every species of fish available.  You are some kind of stud fisherman.
750131,Twocoda,2012-12-08 07:03:00,4130,Excellent recap Cappy....IF you have to go through another heart surgery make it clear to the Docs that they are interrupting your fishing time  On a side note...its been a pleasure being on your team... for my first year of participating in the Tournament ...you set the bar pretty high for any future Captains i may have...Thanks Chris
750134,Skipper D,2012-12-08 07:55:00,1970,"Hey Timex ... looks like you beat out a lot of us , nice going dude ."
750140,ChrisK,2012-12-08 10:35:00,2772,Wow! Great compilation of your season. Hope your ticker is feeling better. Picked up that squirl tale yet
750148,Live2fish85,2012-12-08 12:19:00,1633,"Bill you are to kind, thank you  very much.  Dave thanks as well. I thought I was actually a garbage captain haha.  Thanks  skip haha. My heart is like a Timex haha crap. Wish ii had a Rolex haha.  Thanks Chris, I did get it and have got a bunch done up. I will send a pic your way to see if they look proper. Thanks again."
750151,Live2fish85,2012-12-08 12:30:00,1633," Thanks. They rarely open people up for heart surgeries any more from what I am told. You are correct as well. I had 2 stints in my leg in the groin, one in the other leg at the groin and one through my neck. Messed up part is that when I had my first surgery of this procedure I woke up and they were removed. They now keep them all in until after surgery and when you wake up. It was a messed up feeling having them removed and feeling them all haha."
750158,solopaddler,2012-12-08 13:14:00,8605,What a great year Chris! You did well.
750164,Live2fish85,2012-12-08 14:01:00,1633,Thanks Mike.
