Worst hunting weather I’ve ever experienced. This trip was taken because we didn’t get a moose tag, went to visit a friend on private property. I now have booked the two weeks off in November for another rifle hunt.  I’m struggling choosing an area to go and try.  Does anyone have recommendations east of Sault Ste Marie, I don’t think driving out to Dryden/Kenora will be an option. Bruce mines ? Thessalon?  	I don’t want to know where your best spot is.. just would like recommendations or advice  thanks"
