Thankfully my brother (and the group) stepped up to the plate and pulled together a report They headed into Algonquin for 2 nights - Happy Ilse and Merchant Lake via the Opeongo shuttle All in all they had a great time, caught some fish, tried new gear - jealous I wasn't able to make it https://www.northernjacks.com/post/the-opeongo-shuffle Cheers Andrew "

1076418,gordy28,2021-10-04 11:48:00,638,Doug I know the guys made the meals themselves this time and by all accounts they were great.   I have found that we are starting to gravitate towards easier meals for our trips as opposed to decadent.   We just had a planning chat for our fly in next summer and a few of our more complicated meals got gassed for easier but hardy ones.  Re no smoker ribs this time instead a good pre made chili    Less time cooking and more time fishing and beers at the fore I guess lol Cheers Andrew 
1076421,akaShag,2021-10-04 13:12:00,2073,"Thanks Andrew, for adding to my education.  I did not know that a person could freeze-dry their own food.  I still don't think I would go back to that kind of meals, but home-made is going to be better than dried cardboard in a foil pouch.............just add water and grumble.........🙄"
1076444,gordy28,2021-10-05 11:53:00,638,"No worries.  Yeah I think home dehydrated food is the “new thing”.  Dehydrators are relatively cheap, you control what your eating and the ore bought meals are not cheap Andrew"
