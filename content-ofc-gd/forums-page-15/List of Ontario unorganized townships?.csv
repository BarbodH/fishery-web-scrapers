1076157,misfish,2021-09-22 20:08:00,29133,What exactly is this ?
1076158,Weeds,2021-09-22 20:12:00,782,And why? …never mind. Did a little reading. Interesting.
1076160,Jmeyer,2021-09-22 20:34:00,83,"Unorganized townships are just areas with no local government or services, land in Unorganized townships are in demand because of low taxes and no permits required but tread carefully because anything built still needs to be done to code and if the area falls under a waterway or conservation authority they can make you take it down. The taxes are paid directly to the province but if you need police, fire or ambulance service that comes from a organized township then you may be billed directly. Municipalities have been in the courts with the province for years over costs incurred by servicing Unorganized areas. Highways through these areas are generally provincial /federal or maintained by logging or mining companies."

We have a cottage association which we are all part of that collects approx 60 dollars a year from the land owners which goes to road maintenance and a volunteer fire department( we have a fire truck and properly trained crew) We also have a heli pad and a fantastic boat launch."
