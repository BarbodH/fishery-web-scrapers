1076748,captpierre,2021-10-21 20:57:00,2521,"Just winterizing my 2007. Â Noticed a crack on the port side at the rear above the prop. No crack on the opposite side. Gear case oil is clear like honey. Tried muscling the lower unit forward and backwards and crack doesnâ€™t seem to move. I hit some rocks hard 11 yrs ago. Skeg , prop and mid section of engine damaged. Repaired by dealer and has been perfect since. $4500. What should be done? Â Can this be welded? Â Try JB Weld? Â Or watch it. Iâ€™d appreciate any advice.    "
1076749,Dara,2021-10-21 22:52:00,3052,The vertical cracks don't look real bad but is that horizontal one a crack or a paint seam. Thats serious if its a crack
1076753,Fisherman,2021-10-22 01:00:00,7201,"Good eye but I'm hoping it's a paint seam.Â Â  I wouldn't get too excited about the vertical one, maybe a bit of bondo splitting away."
1076755,BillM,2021-10-22 02:10:00,17367,Saw this on the Lund Facebook group.Â  Looks like a paint crack to me.
1076756,captpierre,2021-10-22 02:14:00,2521,Hoping itâ€™s just paint. A razor blade doesnâ€™t go in further than paint. ðŸ¤ž
1076757,Dara,2021-10-22 02:20:00,3052,Try to get somebody to do a dye penetrant inspection on it. If you know anybody that does inspections for work it's pretty easy I'm too far away to help
1076769,wkrp,2021-10-22 20:57:00,656,I would carefully sand the paint down to the bare metal. If it is cracked you will see it as a dark lines in the metal. Looking at your photos the other side of the engine has no marks or lines . In my opinion if you had cracks in that area you would see the mirror image on both sides
1076771,Dara,2021-10-22 23:08:00,3052,"And if the lines were actual cracks, I think the bottom end would have dropped off by now"
1076772,captpierre,2021-10-22 23:26:00,2521,Thanks Gents. Iâ€™m going to sand it down. If itâ€™s just paint will I need to prime the bare metal before Yammaha paint?
1076774,DRIFTER_016,2021-10-23 02:58:00,10439,Prime with an etching primer for aluminum.
