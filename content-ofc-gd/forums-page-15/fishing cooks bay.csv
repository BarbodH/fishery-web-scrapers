I've not put a lot of time in yet so that's all I can help you with."
1075940,frankliuzzi,2021-09-09 17:07:00,10,thanks for your input 
1075946,BillM,2021-09-09 23:45:00,17367,I'd find the deep weed edges and start there.   I'll assume the boat you're renting has a fish finder?
1075951,frankliuzzi,2021-09-10 12:19:00,10,"thanks bill,not sure if the boats have a fish finder."
1075970,captpierre,2021-09-11 00:46:00,2521,Troll the deepest weeds you can find. Lure should run just above weeds. I always had luck west shore of Snake Island. Perch imitation always works on Simcoe. Don’t forget steel leader. Yap spreaders. and gloves.
