1076364,GBW,2021-10-02 22:44:00,8460,check pm
1076378,AKRISONER,2021-10-03 12:33:00,5558,He definitely does. Heâ€™s doing his own thing though. Been focusing on the st Lawrence but Iâ€™m sure you could get him to run the tri lakes again. gbw probably gave you his number but if not let me know and Iâ€™ll send you it.
1076483,Freshtrax,2021-10-07 04:43:00,2215,Yea where did Pete get to. Fished Sal.on with him o ce and had a blast.
1076484,LostAnotherOne,2021-10-07 10:08:00,956,He was probably just tired of having to go through 30 messages in his inbox a dayÂ ðŸ˜†
1076492,AKRISONER,2021-10-07 19:17:00,5558,"hes around fishing still, just not on the forums anymore. He switched careers and went into the trades a few years back so I think it keeps him pretty darn busy."
