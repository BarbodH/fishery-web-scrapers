With a trolling motor it's pretty good though.   More of a worse case scenario I guess.  Side-to-side in a wide transom would really suck"
1006798,scugpg,2017-06-18 00:37:00,1373,I had a 14' square back and ran a 50lb traxxis off it with a 12v battery at very front. Was the minnkota power center battery box. Worked great. Didn't like paddling it but wasn't too bad.
1007171,Governator,2017-06-22 14:31:00,879,"So what's your guys marine battery recommendation for the trolling motor?  They seem to vary so much in cost, Group 27s in the $125 range at Walmart to easily $300+ elsewhere.  I sort of think for my canoe set up I don't really need the AGM no maintenance battery unless I'm missing something.  I'm assuming just look for the most amp hours I can afford or wish to carry lol?"
1007173,porkpie,2017-06-22 15:17:00,2521,I'd run longer cables to the front for weight distribution and spend $135 on the Walmart group 31.  I'm pretty happy with the one I have.  My new boat came with optima blue tops but I'm pretty sure that when they die I'll just replace em with Walmart batteries.  I'm of the opinion that you can't have too much battery.

Yes a 31 is heavy, no question. If your planning on backcountry fishing a small outboard and gas will be lighter."

1074196,Everglunch,2021-06-22 13:14:00,1,"Guys, what seats would you recommend for an Old Town Rogue River 154?"
1074203,Lillian50,2021-06-22 15:08:00,1,"Suppose you are speaking about seats and boats. My story is that one month ago, I bought an Old Town Rogue River 154. I installed three seats from Welugnal, and I mounted the motor to the stern. You know, it was pretty hard to find a suitable engine. But it's awesome when you have good neighbors who know their job better than me. Welugna seats I chose because my wife insisted that she needs to feel comfortable everywhere and anytime, so a canoe is not an exception. So, I trusted outdoorlifecafe.com recommendations on choosing a durable and comfortable seat for my canoe."
1074218,Hack_Fisherman,2021-06-22 21:50:00,720,"I have a squarestern with a 30 lb thrust troller on it. Works great, can troll slow all day on a group 27 if not windy. what I find to be a PITA is 1) the motor locks down. I’ve hit rock shelf’s twice and it’s not a happy moment. They should swing free like a kicker does in forward gear. I don’t use it enough to look at modifying. 2) the damn tiller handle is right behind my back. I almost think I’d prefer the motor to be mounted off to one side. Maybe if I lost some of my 24 pack I’d be better off.   EDIT: I just learned that a simple mod is to rotate the control head 90 degrees to one side so it’s easier to use. “Duh, why didn’t I think of that moment!” Since my boat is currently full of holes (rivet replacement) I might actually dig out the canoe and try this mini mod.

I added seats hung on brackets from the gunwales.  For a low center of gravity!Since i fly fish a lot, for added stability i made up some retractable stowable outriggers. I can stand and cast. Very stable!  "
1076524,pics,2021-10-09 13:01:00,1268,The transom mount motor just screws on once you get to the lake.  If it's a flat back I'd just go with gas. Lugging a battery won't be fun unless you spend big on lithium.
1006367,Governator,2017-06-13 19:29:00,879,"Hey Guys, been a while.  I'm picking up a Sportspal canoe this weekend with the intention of adding a motor to it in the near future (probably 30lb thrust range).  Anyway, curious what your side mounts look like (DIY guys?), where you store the battery and is it ok for it be exposed to any water or does it need to be in a box?  Thanks"
1006394,Joeytier,2017-06-14 01:05:00,3990,"Spent many hundreds of hrs in a sportspal with an electric trolling motor.  Battery definitely doesn't need to be covered, just more of a pain to bring a case with it.  If we were two in a canoe the battery went under the seat but on solo missions I would push it as far up towards the middle as the cables would allow and added some rocks in the bow.  Depending on what you plan on doing with it, a gas motor may be a better option."
1006403,PickerelHunter,2017-06-14 02:08:00,100,"I've gone with both, electric and gas in the past.  Both have their pro's and cons.  For the electric, go with what Joeytier said....I have mine in a battery case, as well as extra long cables for front canoe placement of battery.  In terms of the actual side mount, it was very simple.  Will take you a few minutes and cost very little.  The canoe at the moment is buried under the deck but for now take a look at this video, I basically followed this but I used 2x4 for all pieces.  Has held up really well for over 5 years now.  "
1006413,pics,2017-06-14 07:06:00,1268,Sportspal has a motor mount that they sell with a canoe but I find them a little weak for my 2hp . I use an aftermarket mount that's a little heavier to carry but it's sturdy.. I can't post pictures right now though. If I was going to put an electric motor on I wouldn't use a box for the battery.

I have a 50lb thrust Minnkota, and when it's windy and you have two guys in the canoe it makes a difference.  I also have a 3.5hp outboard.  It will darn near plane it out.  If you are buying new I'd look at a wide transom rather than a pointed end boat.  Especially if you intend to use it mainly with a motor."
1006422,BillM,2017-06-14 13:11:00,17367,"Yup, you want a squareback for sure, makes life a lot easier if there's going to be a motor strapped to it all the time."
1006423,Governator,2017-06-14 13:22:00,879,"Thanks a lot guys, great info here.  What about paddling in a squareback?  Is that difficult?  Probably comparable to the average 12' aluminum?  I figured the double pointed would give me the flexibility of fishing the small lakes I hit and still be able to easily paddle compared to a wide transom. Even though it'll mostly be used with a motor I wouldn't mind the occasional short canoe trip to Algonquin or Temagami.  Not sure how the wide transom handles for paddling but I've also gotten myself in to many scenarios where the motor broke down, out of gas across a lake (or at a campsite) that we've had to paddle our way back (sometimes in bad weather) which isn't fun but I think should be easier in a pointed canoe especially when if I'm solo."
1006425,BillM,2017-06-14 13:32:00,17367,"I've paddled a lot of squarebacks, sure it's not the ideal situation, but it's not the worst either."
1006428,porkpie,2017-06-14 14:36:00,2521,"They actually row ok believe it or not, and sportspal sets them up for that.  No sportspal that I've ever met has paddled very well, that includes my buddies old double ender that we used to duck hunt out of.  They are lightweight, easily repairable and pretty stable rigs.  I enjoyed fishing and even hunting a couple of times out of mine last season.  I only use a motor, either electric or gas, but I did test out the oar situation and it works well enough!"
1006431,SirCranksalot,2017-06-14 16:03:00,3291,"A couple of comments-  When I went solo using a motor I added extensions to the lead so I could put the battery up front for ballast.  Don't use rocks for ballast. Use a big jug/pail completely full of water to avoid sloshing. Water, unlike rocks, are neutral buoyancy and won't sink your boat in a mishap. A big block of wood might be even better."

1006469,Old Ironmaker,2017-06-14 21:18:00,8243,"My buddy had a nice 18' Sportpal with a flat transom. He did try a 30LB electric but it wasn't enough to move the bigger canoe well and found himself in full throttle too much which killed the 12V too quickly. He went to a 55lb Motorguide and even though 24V the batteries would last longer with the 2 of us at around 440 lbs total weight plus stuff including an extra 100 pound battery. The batteries lasted longer than my knees and back.  If you are going to do this go with more thrust than 30 for sure. And I would take the construction hints from the guy in the video with a grain of salt. I had to laugh when he said the wood only gets wet when he uses the canoe so no wood treatment necessary. Then he says use washers if you want. OK, just bring an adjustable. I always spend the few bucks extra for stainless hardware when it comes to the boat. Nothing more frustrating tome than to see a nice job and rusting hardware. Trex decking cut to size might be something to use rather than lumber. 2 pieces of Trex laminated together would be very stable and look clean. I think they are 1/2"" or 5/4 thick."
1006485,EC1,2017-06-14 23:18:00,930,"I own the 14' sportspal with a transom back which was modified by one of the members of this forum - can't remember who. In the back, you can put a 2hp to hit about 10km/h which isn't bad. You can go through 10k zones at full throttle lol.  In the front, I bought one of those BPS Trolling motor mounts and just clamp it across the front to have a tiller bow mount trolling motor. This way, you actually have a lot more control than the trolling in the back. Battery goes behind the front row of seats. I did wear out the front a little bit doing this, but i don't see it breaking anytime soon.  http://m.basspro.com/Bass-Pro-Shops-Canoe-Motor-Mount/product/67133/"

1006496,Old Ironmaker,2017-06-15 01:21:00,8243,All nice set ups. I really like the rod holders Smithy. Amazing what one can do with some plumbing piping.  Lucas I told you that I grew up in the same story and a half style home in Hammertown when you showed pics when you did a reno a few years ago. They must have built a few thousand on the mountain and the east end at the end of WW2.  Not too top heavy with the seats in the canoe Lucas? How's the new place?

The 2hp Yamaha is nice and light so it doesn't cause the canoe to tilt too much.. If it was up to me I would have a wide transom as well and use whatever one works best for where I am going to fish.. I definitely wouldn't want to carry a wide transom very far through the woods.. The only mod I am plan on doing this year is to add a removable carrying yoke..
