1076077,floater,2021-09-18 00:31:00,220,Just got back from Bisco. Great fishing trip. The Sultan Road was in better shape than most roads in Toronto. No issues at all driving in the 70 Km to D&D cottages. Nice cottage with Bell Express view for the one rain day we had. We trolled mostly bottom bouncers with worm harnesses and managed to land over 60 pickerel between two guys. Biggest was 18 inches and allot in the  14 to 17 inch size. Manages a few pike as well with biggest about 30 inches. Its a really big expanse of lakes up there with.many km of boating.  Not our highest number of fish trips but worth a trip back. Next time we will go back in the spring and hope for more pike.
1076078,Hack_Fisherman,2021-09-18 01:58:00,720,Thanks for sharing. What we’re their cottages and rates like? assuming housekeeping units?
1076080,Terry,2021-09-18 11:16:00,14456,I looked at their website not very useful unless they have more then one website could you share price and what you get in a package thanks 
1076108,floater,2021-09-19 11:28:00,220,"We stayed in Cottage One. It was 60 bucks per night per person. It sleeps ten to twelve, if there are two couples, or ten if just guys.  Cottage has hydro. Baseboard Heat and hot water tank. Lots of hot water. Water is from lake so bring your own for coffee. Bell Express View. New screened in porch. You can leave your boat in the water at the docks. The docks are about 80 meters from the cottage in a sheltered bay. There is a fish cleaning hut with hydro so I charged my boat batteries every day. There is a general store in the small town that sells booze and beer and some other necessities.  Very pricey though. You can get gas at the store and there are other guys that sell ice and worms and minnows scattered throughout the town.  The owner didn't mind how many or how few stayed in the Cabin. By the end of the 9 days there were only two of us. This may be different in the spring but not sure."
1076113,Hack_Fisherman,2021-09-19 16:41:00,720,Thanks for posting. This place is on my bucket list! do you know what they charge for boats? Mines pooched for the rest of the season
1076121,Terry,2021-09-19 23:29:00,14456,Thanks for the info
1076127,floater,2021-09-20 13:45:00,220,Boats were 50 bucks per day plus gas. He had 5 gallons for 45 bucks so bring gas! You can fish as close as the railway bridge. It's only about 600 meters from the dock. All the locals jig there in the evenings. We trolled bottom bouncers across all points and only did a little jigging.
1076131,Hack_Fisherman,2021-09-20 22:40:00,720,"Was the cottage like a big open dorm full of bunk beds, or does it have a bunch of bedrooms? Is it comfy enough for families or is this a real basic roughin it type place? I don’t care if it’s the ritz...just want to know if this is a guys weekend spot or good enough for a family trip."
1076135,floater,2021-09-21 12:20:00,220,Three bedrooms. One had a double bunk beds. One had a single bunk beds and the third had two sets of single bunk beds. The two futons in the living room fold down.
1076136,Terry,2021-09-21 12:38:00,14456,Sounds good
1076159,mikdor,2021-09-22 20:24:00,109,I stayed at a nice little operation the last three years it is very reasonably priced and will accommodate 4 people and Ed will put You on the fish. Give him a call at 705-239-0809 You won't be disappointed.
1076163,Terry,2021-09-22 22:47:00,14456,.Do they have a website   and a name please  
1076164,misfish,2021-09-22 22:50:00,29133,"Ed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,  "
1076165,Terry,2021-09-22 22:52:00,14456,You think their fishing  camp is called Ed interesting.
1076166,BillM,2021-09-23 02:08:00,17367,LOL @ Terry
1076169,floater,2021-09-23 12:43:00,220,"Our guy told us there are only four operators on the Lake. His is D& D cottages and they have a facebook account. There is the Sportsman lodge, Ritchies End of Trail and there is Grey Owl cabins that has a few boat in only cabins with solar power fridges and lights."
1076171,Terry,2021-09-23 13:27:00,14456,"Thanks, it’s funny none of them have pricing on their website I almost always go with a lodge that shows their price. It makes it much easier to make a discussion rather then talking on the phone and writing down price hoping  you asked all the right questions"
