Walked as far as he could, think he,s about a foot shorter then you. LOL Know the spot ?  How about now ? LOL  We both got the Frogg Togg hell bender waders. I have to say,for the price, $165 tax in, free delivery Amazon ,they are not bad at all.Â  Do not know you are wearing waders. Very nice fit .   I was there very early, who the hell knows why. Maybe it was due to my first trip to this spot this season and really like it. Up at 3 am , there by 4 am,3 timmies til day break.LOL  Managed 1 eater on a 6mm pink bead. I am really getting into this bead thing. Absolutely amazing, how they catch fish . "
