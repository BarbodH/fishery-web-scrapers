1076785,atvaholic,2021-10-25 15:28:00,271,"Just wondering what y'all have for any roadside assistance that covers a trailer? Was on an ATV/fishing in the middle of nowhere (as usual) Had a near bad experience where the trailer came off the ball recently, and it somehow pulled/broke the trailer brake wires. Going to consider some roadside assistance incase I cant get my machines home."
1076786,Fisherman,2021-10-25 15:39:00,7201,"If I'm not mistaken CAA has an option for that in the future.   Why can't you get the trailer home on a ""careful"" drive and then get the wiring fixed.  Pretty easy to do."
1076787,Cosmos,2021-10-25 15:53:00,588,I have CAA RV Premium - that one will take care of trailer as well.

1076789,atvaholic,2021-10-25 18:12:00,271,"We did manage it. It just got me thinking. The trailer came off the ball, if the tongue mechanism was broken I wasnt getting my ATV's home."
1076790,Fisherman,2021-10-25 18:20:00,7201,"Depending what kind of mechanism the couple has, most of the time it's the 3/4 inch nut under the coupler latch that needs tightening a little bit.  The whole latch mechanism can be replaced on those.    Another point, 10-12 % of total trailer weight including load should be the tongue weight,  lack of that can pop the hitch off."
1076831,akaShag,2021-10-28 19:43:00,2073,Same.  And good folks to deal with when you are broken down at the side of the road.
1076843,Ron,2021-10-28 23:00:00,1683,"I have nothing but praise for the CAA Plus I have and will be a lifetime member. I blew a wheel bearing in Nipigon to the point of no longer having a usable axle on the trailer, I had to kick the tire on to launch the boat. CAA covered the cost of hauling my trailer to Thunder Bay to have a new axle installed."
