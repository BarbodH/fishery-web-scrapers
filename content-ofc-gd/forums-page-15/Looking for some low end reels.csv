1076517,atvaholic,2021-10-09 00:01:00,271,Looking at some low end reels for the kids in the 1000 and 2500 size. Had a few Pfleugers but they let me down. looking for something that is half decent and will last more than a couple of seasons. Any experience with:  Shimano Sienna Shiman FX series

They have been bullet proof and work today as well as they did when I bought them. I'm pretty sure they where $29.99 each plus tax. If you can find them somewhere I think they will work well for you  as long as you are going after smaller fish and don't need large line capacity."
1076520,glen,2021-10-09 11:30:00,2641,I have a few   Shimano Sienna and FX series reels.  I use 4-8lb mono on the cheaper reels.   So I don’t brake them.   	they have been working great for years. And lots of small mouth.   	most of my reels are shimano.
1076579,porkpie,2021-10-11 15:17:00,2521,My kids also use the Siennas.  Surprisingly decent reels at a low price.  I also use the smaller ones on almost all of my ice rods.  Good stuff!

1076697,AKRISONER,2021-10-17 20:56:00,5558,Another vote for the sienna. I run them on all of my ice fishing gear
