1076114,smitty55,2021-09-19 17:21:00,928," You could try looking back in this thread for the video, it was posted already. As was already posted as well is that a big boat like that doesn't need to be going very fast to kill someone. Did you even read all the posts here before making all these assumptions?"
1076115,dave524,2021-09-19 17:53:00,4508,"There is actually video from earlier that day at the O'Leary dock where his wife docks the boat and does up the lines also pulling out later she is at the helm and appears to be very proficient with the boat, Kevin on the other hand sits at the back like he is clueless, I really think she is the mariner in the family edit : I like how she takes the stern light from him LOL "
1076116,Spiel,2021-09-19 18:17:00,9065,"So, took the to time to install the rear navigational light in broad daylight knowing they would have a post sunset departure. 	Seems forward thinking to me."
1076118,woodenboater,2021-09-19 19:24:00,2277,makes me wonder if O'Leary married into an old Muskoka family. Linda looked pretty at ease docking etc..
1076123,porkpie,2021-09-20 00:50:00,2521,"Wow,  video evidence is pretty compelling.  Bet Oleary is happy that both he and his buddy had expensive security systems! "
1076124,chris.brock,2021-09-20 03:11:00,4053,"no, I don't read all this stuff, don't care to kevins boat hammered the gas and was getting on plane in the pitch black night that video of mrs oleary bouncing the boat into the dock with the date and time stamped on it just makes me laugh, what a façade, what a joke justice denied!"
1076125,Rizzo,2021-09-20 12:40:00,4754,gotta admit...I was thinking the same thing. Is it so hard to change the date on your recording equipment and film a video a day or 2 later? I also found it weird that buddy on the dock doesn't touch the boat at all and lets it bounce off the dock. Every person I know would stop the boat from hitting the dock not just stand there like a dummy doing nothing (unless they were told...don't do anything).
1076129,Dara,2021-09-20 21:04:00,3052,That says it all  You saw him on Tv a couple times so his wife is guilty cause he has a few dollars. 
1076130,BillM,2021-09-20 22:08:00,17367,"Sad all around.   Being out in the middle of a lake, at night with zero lights on is asking for problems.   That's just carelessness.  If there's a lawsuit, I won't be surprised if it's against the owner of the boat who got hit by not following the laws in place for navigation lighting."
1076201,Canuck,2021-09-25 12:50:00,491,"I stand behind what the court decided.  There are multiple causes of any accident, but the other boat was stopped mid-lake, and had no lights on, which is against the relevant law, and that was the primary reason for the accident.  And speculation that the other video was tampered with is ridiculous, pure speculation.  I don’t like him either, but leave it to the courts to assess evidence."
1076251,chris.brock,2021-09-27 03:46:00,4053,his wife wasn't driving the wrong word boat! if 2 people weren't dead I wouldn't care
1076252,chris.brock,2021-09-27 04:12:00,4053,"I've boated and snowmobiled my whole life after dark, if you can hardly see you don't outrun your lights or outrun what you can see there's late night canoeists, x country skiers on the ice in the dark, hardly visible fish huts, they all have a right to be out there if you're under power you're liable, the rich silly got off in this case, and I wouldn't care except 2 people died "
1076256,woodenboater,2021-09-27 12:50:00,2277,exactly this 
1076258,lew,2021-09-27 13:21:00,12766,"Yup, if you going a sensible speed in the dark and keeping an eye on the water around you with a flashlight there shouldn't be a problem."
1076262,glen,2021-09-27 14:53:00,2641,Stub toe in dark blame coffee table.
1076272,Spiel,2021-09-27 18:19:00,9065,"How stupid do you have to be, to be sitting in an unlit boat in the dead of night while you can hear another boat approaching and not turn on some form of lighting to make your presence known?  	Oh wait, they couldn't hear another boat approaching or see it approaching with navigational lights on. Why would that be?"
1076295,Rizzo,2021-09-28 21:41:00,4754,"My guess is they didn't hear the boat coming because they were probably drinking (or other?) and having a good ol time. Maybe even had some music on. Stargazing takes darkness, not quietness! Not seeing the boat coming? I guess if you are staring up at the sky you wouldn't see a boat coming."
1076316,jonasdry,2021-09-30 14:12:00,63,"Have you seen a video of him actually driving the boat? None of the videos yet have shown anyone but her driving the boat. I suppose ""that one time"" he was driving it?"
1076031,lew,2021-09-14 15:17:00,12766,"Been watching a bit about this verdict this morning and according to the judge it was determined the other boat had no lights on and Linda O was not speeding and wasn't drunk. Seems to me there must have been some amount of speed to hit the other boat hard enough to kill 2 people but I wasn't there and didn't witness the crash. I'm not a judge but have spent an INSANE amount of time over my lifetime fishing in the dark and IMHO driving a boat after dark without using a flashlight to see what's in front of you is just asking for trouble. I couldn't begin to know how many times I came across people fishing with no lights on the boat and I'm sure I would have hit some without a light shining in front of me. Again, just my opinion but it seems to me if your driving a boat in the darkness without a flashlight and you collide with an anchored, unlit boat you should be held at least partly to blame. I doubt many people would drive down a dark hiway without headlights and I really don't see a difference. Just wondering what others may think ?"
1076033,Canuck,2021-09-14 16:20:00,491,"I also run at night in my boat, but in pitch dark, you can’t use a flashlight to drive because it kills your night vision and only illuminates what is in the beam.  For me, a light shortens the distance you can see, not the other way around. I agree that speed had to be a factor though.  You should never drive faster than you can see (strange way to say it, but you know what I mean).  I think the biggest reason she got off was the fact the other boat did not have its anchor lights on.  That is a law that is there for the exact reason that its hard to see boats at night that don’t have the normal nav lights on. Since the people were star gazing, I expect they went out for a nice night and turned off the anchor/nav lights to be able to see the stars better.  Resulted in a horrible tragedy.  Who knows if they would have been seen if the lights were on.  We’ll never know I guess. We all need to ensure we have the proper lights on your boat if you are out at night."
1076034,lew,2021-09-14 17:51:00,12766,We're all entitled to our opinions but I was just referring to myself when using a flashlight and for me it worked great for many decades and as stated above it helped keep me from hitting other boats.
1076035,smitty55,2021-09-14 18:52:00,928,What I find the most alarming is that even though the stargazers had no lights on in their boat they must have heard and seen the other boat nearby and yet none of them had the common sense to at least turn on some lights or shine a flashlight at the other boat to let them know there was a boat anchored. Something still doesn't add up. 
1076037,Spiel,2021-09-14 21:41:00,9065,"There's a reason why navigational lights on a boat are designed not to interfere with the vessel operators vision and yet still provide visual acuity to the where abouts of other vessels operating at night.  	I have more than once admonished a passenger for shining a flashlight about if I had not directly requested them to do so.  	In short, an unlit boat is a boating hazard."
1076038,porkpie,2021-09-14 21:58:00,2521,"Late night booze cruise is a possibility. It’s not unusual on cottage lakes to see an unlit pontoon and hear the clink of glasses and laughter.  Stargazing, avoiding attention, call it what you will.  I’ve seen it many times on the family cottage lake.  Mind you, who takes a shot of booze when returning to the dock after a late night collision when your son has just called 911.  I’d say their is negligence on both sides here.  Truth will never come out because there is too much money on both sides!"
1076039,Terry,2021-09-14 22:57:00,14456,"A boat the size of theirs would do major damage even going 10 km I was trolling out from picton one night  and all but ran into a boat that was sitting with no lights , we ( the 4 of us) could not see the boat  none of us drank any booze and about  15 ft from the other boat we heard them yell and still couldn’t see them we stopped and drifted into the boat but used our hands to push off to not do damage   I agree with the outcome of this ruling  "
1076042,AKRISONER,2021-09-15 11:30:00,5558,"I personally believe her sobriety is based on a technicality, but nearly impossible to prove due to the circumstances. I also believe the people that got hit are totally negligent as well for parking a boat at night with no lights on. Heck, unlit boats are nearly impossible to see at twighlight if they get up against the shoreline. Multiple times I’ve seemingly had boats just appear out of nowhere after cutting to the middle of the lake after being near shore after the sun has gone down with no lights on. a tragedy is what I would call this on all parts. Two people are dead because people didn’t follow the rules."
1076044,John,2021-09-15 13:53:00,2956,"I have my own strong opinions on this tragedy. Who was actually driving, alcohol, speed and of course MONEY to afford the legal council of Greenspan...... and have had from the start of the investigation. I have no wish to share them in detail here as this is the type of thread that goes South quickly. 'Nuff said!"
1076045,dave524,2021-09-15 13:59:00,4508,"Our media and the O'Leary's are at opposite ends of the political spectrum, the press was in a hanging mode but justice prevailed."
1076046,craigdritchie,2021-09-15 14:18:00,1586,"It seems like everyone has an opinion on this, or an opinion of the people involved. Putting that all aside, the security camera video evidence is crystal clear. https://youtu.be/KaQwdSekfQg At the 1:35 mark you can see the O'Leary's boat appear, with its lights on. At 1:53, it hits the other boat. At 2:10, the other boat begins turning on its lights. Regardless of who has money and who doesn't, the one thing that cannot be disputed is that the boat Mrs O'Leary hit did not have its lights on. The court got it right, fault lies with the operator of the second boat. Everything else is just window dressing. "
1076050,Canuck,2021-09-15 20:02:00,491,"I had not seen that video before.  Its very clear.  I agree with you 100%.  And it actually looks like the O'leary boat was not going at high speed.   Maybe a bit too high for a moonless night, but if they know the lake I can see why they might be running at that speed.  Its rarely just one mistake that causes tragedy, but I will bet that if they had their lights on, there would be two people alive today."
1076055,pics,2021-09-16 07:39:00,1268,Before I saw the video I had assumed fault was with Linda O'Leary. I  also assumed that the boat that was hit would be after some big bucks... you know what they say about assuming....🤦‍♂️
1076068,captpierre,2021-09-17 11:13:00,2521,Pretty sure this isn’t over. No criminal charges but civil suits are sure to follow.
1076069,lew,2021-09-17 11:18:00,12766,"As I said in my original post, if someone on the O'Leary boat had taken a second to scan the waters ahead once in awhile, none of this would have happened. No deaths, no injuries and no lawsuits. Sad deal all around."
1076070,captpierre,2021-09-17 11:25:00,2521,I guess the court was trying to decide whether a crime was committed.  For sure it would have been wise to proceed more slowly and scan appropriately for the conditions.  But foolishness is usually not a crime.  But where is the line 🤷🏻‍♂️
1076071,dave524,2021-09-17 12:12:00,4508,"Seems the police almost crashed doing a re-enactment and they had radio comms between the 2 boats, they cancelled the re-enactment cause they deemed it too dangerous.

1076079,glen,2021-09-18 02:52:00,2641,If you can’t see while driving on the lake how do you keep from running into shore?  Lots of unlit stationary objects to run into.   	lf your driving down a road in a car do you speed up if you can’t see? If you rear end a car in poor visibility who’s at fault? If you run into a stopped object you are going too fast. 
1076081,John Bacon,2021-09-18 15:05:00,3277,I also find that a flash light makes it harder to see at night.  Especially if the person shines it down into the hull of the boat. 
1076082,Sinker,2021-09-18 15:20:00,8692,"I do a lot of running at night. I find the best thing is a hand held spot light. One that plugs into your main power, not a rechargable one, they always die when you need them most. I run with my bow light on, and I shine the spot light as needed to scan for anything in my way.  I use a bright spotlight, if you can't see me coming, your blind, or asleep. I also agree that running with too many lights is blinding, especially if there is any fog, or mist coming off the water, its brutal. Can't see anything. Those nights I run with just the bow light, and use my spot light as little as I can. I don't know why everyone assumed O'leary was guilty. That video tells all for me.  S."
1076083,lew,2021-09-18 18:07:00,12766,"Exactly the point I was trying to make Shane, scan the area then turn the light off again, not running down the lake with flood lights on and trying to light up the other side of the lake."

1076104,smitty55,2021-09-19 03:34:00,928,"Wow, you must know Kevin quite well to make that assumption. So according to you the people in the boat that was hit didn't even see the driver?
