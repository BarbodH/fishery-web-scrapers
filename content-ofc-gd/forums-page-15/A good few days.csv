River will be blown again for the next 5-7 days .¬† Seems many had the same idea. Never seen so many guys during the weekdays. We managed to catch our share of nice fresh fish. Smoker is getting a work out now. I have been having a lot of luck with the bead set up, but there are a lot of swings and misses with this set up. Some fish hit it so fast,you swing and well, on and off. I was getting a bit frustrated at times,but hey,that's fishing. Something came to me this morning . Something that worked well for me many many years ago. BOILED EGGS. I have a small bag of singles I kind of over cured . How much you ask ? Well, I could bounce one on the floor and I could catch it mid air. Like those super balls way back.LOL So get a pot of water boiling, toss in a spoon full and low and behold, the perfect single egg . These go on the hook instead of putting a bead 2"" up from it. They had a nice dot on them which was perfect.¬† Light starts to show and floating time it was. 2 drift in,I am hooked up but came off. I am on to something here. Well I was, but was 0-3 first 1/2 hour. Then it happen, The float goes down,set and game on. Real nice battle . With trees and logs around, these fish have the advantage. Really had to work the power of the rod to keep them at bay.  Had a great few days fishing with my sons buddy's, as he had to work. For a change,it was me telling him about the action, not the other way round. LOL Few fish from the days. Not to worry about the 3 fish shot. 2 were mine, the other was buddy,s. We just had them on the same rope.           "
1076661,John,2021-10-15 16:14:00,2956,What size and type of hook Brian?
1076662,misfish,2021-10-15 16:29:00,29133,single egg #8 - #10 John
1076666,kuhaman,2021-10-15 20:10:00,503,Nice man!! I can fire up my smoker if you wanna bring them by !!!!üòÅ
1076667,misfish,2021-10-15 20:26:00,29133,"LOL My son will be up your way next week to fish the Geen. Think it is a King Of The Drift thing. Asked if I wanted to head up. One of these days I will. That water is a whole different animal to fish. Also,I do not think my knee could take the walk and pressure, from that fast water. Last thing we both need, is for him to be fishing me out of the water. LOL"
1076668,kuhaman,2021-10-15 20:34:00,503,"The geen truly is a magnificent multi species fishery, Spent many a day in my younger years drift fishing for steel and bottom fishing for kitties."
1076669,OhioFisherman,2021-10-15 20:48:00,6623,"Brian, you're using a 8 - 10 size hook for stealth reasons? Hard for me to tell by the eggs pictures, but will they handle a size 6 hook? They are drifting under a float, it may not hurt to try? might keep them hooked better?"
1076670,misfish,2021-10-15 21:00:00,29133,"8 and 10 work just fine Paul.¬† Not really looking for more hook ups, as what I am using works fine. It, is just part of the game. I like the smaller hooks as they do not stand out . The eggs I am using, will hide the whole / 90% of hook. I will get a pic on my next outing. Decided to boil up the small batch of hard shells I had, so will have lots for the next couple of months."
1076678,Rustic-Fisher,2021-10-16 13:14:00,826,NICE!!!¬† those singles look deadly!
1076679,aplumma,2021-10-16 13:54:00,6896,"Very cool Brian,¬† Down here we don't have cold water fish I need to get the darn border open again so I can see my buds to go fishing. Art"
1076707,porkpie,2021-10-19 04:29:00,2521,"Try cooking your singles in muriatic acid pal.¬† Looks like a fresh egg, but hard enough to put on a hook!"
1076717,LeXXington,2021-10-19 20:06:00,1928,wow very nice fish
1076722,John,2021-10-20 12:07:00,2956,You know I'm a fan of going smaller right?
