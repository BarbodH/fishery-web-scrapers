1076299,Snidley,2021-09-29 16:25:00,620,This guy wants $10 per lure. He's in Oshawa area https://www.kijiji.ca/v-view-details.html?adId=1574164641  They are on Kijiji all the time. Not really hard to find. Now try and find a Jackal Geronimo Magnum. That's hard to find

1076733,Nemo,2021-10-21 02:26:00,727,Le Baron's price tag. Haven't seen one of those in a while .

1076743,irishfield,2021-10-21 15:26:00,26272,"YEP, regular $3.04 each and on sale below that!"
1076745,Nemo,2021-10-21 17:00:00,727,Spent plenty of money there over the years but I loved going in there and browsing.
1076751,irishfield,2021-10-21 23:31:00,26272,Still fishing with my Berkley lightning rods and a baitcasting reel that I bought in LB's in 1984 !

535721,vinnimon,2011-01-07 03:22:00,2593,"I was reminded of a lure I once had and cant seem to find in all the tackle shops Ive visited. The beno im looking for specifically, is like the one in the pic, it was all black with yellow eyes. It may have had an extra joint as the one in the pic Its been a while! If anyone has one, or comes across one, please let me know! I prefer one from the 70s to early 80s. Ive searched the antique markets as well! Thanks in advance v  "
535726,asdve23rveavwa,2011-01-07 03:34:00,2690,"Don't have that one, but, I've got the old yellow with black spots, just one jointed segment.  By the way, check your e-mails, Vince."
535727,Old Man,2011-01-07 03:34:00,822,"I had a similar Beno, but orange in colour with black spots. My wife snagged and lost it a couple of years ago and I've looked everywhere for a replacement. I had great luck with it on smallmouth."
535734,OhioFisherman,2011-01-07 03:51:00,6623,"http://shop.ebay.com/?_from=R40&_trksid=m570&_nkw=beno+lures  The company that used to make them, Mill Run Products was located in Cleveland. I have no idea if they are still in business."
535738,vinnimon,2011-01-07 04:07:00,2593,"  thats where I got the pic from, the black one exactly, except with yellow eyes! I never seen another one for sale since I lost mine in the 80s"
535750,OhioFisherman,2011-01-07 04:52:00,6623,"vinnimon, I can find nothing to indicate the company is still in business. They were a small company with a limited product line, and the fall of walleye fishing here in the 50`s and 60`s hurt them I would imagine. There were also similar looking lures, flatfish, lazy ike, canadian wiggler that were bigger companies.  My best guess that finding one would be ebay, garage sales, flea markets. As I recall I used to deliver to them back in the early to mid 70`s, but really haven`t seen there lures for sale even here for a longtime.  We did use them on trips up north back in the 60`s and 70`s."
535758,John Bacon,2011-01-07 06:00:00,3277,They have had quite a few owners.  They have always been a favourize of mine.  They were defintely still being sold in the 90's; I am not sure if they are still made.    Here is some info.  http://lureandmore.com/viewtopic.php?f=362&t=3705&start=10
535788,Garnet,2011-01-07 12:52:00,2056,The old Beno was incredible. You can cast and crank them through the thickest standing grass. Was my go to bait on Scugog.  I've had a friend that's into the BBC tackle board looking for 2 years no luck so far.
535789,solopaddler,2011-01-07 12:57:00,8605,It wasn't that long ago I ordered 2 dozen of the things online direct from Luhr Jensen.  Did a quick check and it appears Luhr Jensen has dropped them from their product line.  As mentioned ebay will be your best bet.
535830,johnnyb,2011-01-07 14:46:00,3413,There is one wedged under a rock on 3 Mile Lake near Utterson....hooks might be a bit rusty now as my buddy lost it 20 years ago.  He still goes on about it....loves the Beno
535935,asdve23rveavwa,2011-01-07 17:55:00,2690,"Back in the day...okay waaaaaay back in my pre-teen years, the yellow/black spotted Beno was our go to walleye (pickeral) lure.  I'm glad I still have one of them from back then just for sentimental value."
536200,spincast,2011-01-08 00:00:00,3279,Okay - so we have a few talented lure makers on the board from what I've seen in some of the postings... looks like this could be a winner........ any takers....?
536202,linweir,2011-01-08 00:02:00,202,Very good lure. Scugog musky and walleye love them.
536217,vinnimon,2011-01-08 00:26:00,2593,"When I lost this lure in the late 80s, i went back to purchase another one. No one had one, some never carried it . I may have purchased the last one in this area  It may be easier to make one, than to find one as such. But I will keep searching!    "
536234,Fisherman,2011-01-08 00:38:00,7201,"I don't suppose you mean one like this:My link I got that in 1968 at Big Pauls Sporting in Pickering, one of the first lures I ever bought."
536240,vinnimon,2011-01-08 00:41:00,2593,"  yes sir, except like the one I posted above."
536247,Fisherman,2011-01-08 00:44:00,7201,"Vinnimon, I believe they were called a Beno Eel. There's 2 on ebay."
536251,OhioFisherman,2011-01-08 00:48:00,6623,"Yes, Beno eel, they had a very snake like movement in the water."
536254,tomO,2011-01-08 00:51:00,363,I've got two solid black with yellow eyes but they both only have one joint.
536268,lew,2011-01-08 01:09:00,12766,I caught my 1st ever musky close to 40 years ago on a Beno Eel while fishing for pickeral. I don't use it anymore but I've still got it tucked away in a tackle box around here somewhere. Seems to me it's green with spots on it.  Used to catch alot of fish with an orange one too.
536836,Loonietoon,2011-01-09 01:47:00,1450,Vince I also lost that particular Beno eel in the colors Yellow W/black dots as well as the orange w/black dots as well as the green w/black dots... best lure I ever used.. Dame that company for closing up. Checked with so many different people Told lots of luck trying to find any.. Lost all of mine at Dunnville around the docks..
1030599,CptCheesesticks,2018-07-03 05:40:00,1,"I caught my very first walleye with a Beno at 6 years old with a perch patterned single joint that my Dad gave me back in ‘87. To this day, I still have it. It’s hanging from my mirror in my truck. Also have a few I’ve been afraid to use still kicking around in an old tackle box. Walleye used to go mental for these things.  p.s. I realize this thread is 7 years old, but I’m just glad to hear stories from other people that enjoyed these lures as much as I did. You can still find plenty on eBay, some still in original packaging.   "

My brother law is pretty shady corrector  tattoo  artist ,scrapper pulls into driveway with this tackle box and couple  junk rods with the story helping a buddy. All the tackle run of mill junk. Except the 6 beno's.  And they aren't for sale."
