1076322,georginaisle,2021-09-30 16:34:00,42,I'm looking to buy a fly combo and don't know if 6 weight is too small or 8 weight is too big It will be used mostly for trout 2-8 lbs
1076329,misfish,2021-09-30 19:50:00,29133,I use a 5 wt for those small river fish . 9 wt for those big feisty fall runners here on the notty .
1076331,georginaisle,2021-09-30 22:21:00,42,So I guess a 6 weight is what I need
1076333,Spiel,2021-09-30 22:43:00,9065,A 5 or 6 weight is a good place to start.  	For reference where I convert Spey Rods to Float rods for Steelhead they're almost exclusively 5 and 6 weights.
1076346,BillM,2021-10-01 14:34:00,17367,6wt would be be the ticket.
1076353,woodenboater,2021-10-02 00:51:00,2277,"I liked 5 or 6 for trout on smallish streams/rivers. 8-10 (sinking tip) for bass and pike, when you eventually go that route"
