1076610,glen,2021-10-13 03:05:00,2641,I wonder how big the fine is.
1076617,Slingfisher,2021-10-13 15:23:00,8,"A CO would not have checked the freezer without reasonable cause.  IOW, he didn’t just randomly check someone’s freezer.  Someone tipped him off.  Probably someone tired of people keeping more than their limit.  This fish story sounds a bit fishy."
1076618,glen,2021-10-13 15:51:00,2641,The judge asked how long it will take to pay the fine. The guilty said I don’t know. It depends on how good the fish are biting.
1076621,Manfy,2021-10-13 18:09:00,7,It's not a big story and it's real cause guess what everyone it's our story my parents story and they have never been fined before. We do not catch more than our limit and if you actually read the comments I have wrote back it all makes sense 12 fish are mine my husband's And my 10 year old son 4 each wow that's in limit everyone We don't use darn nets we're not dumb This is the truth so there ya go He got caught with them all in our family cottage freezer The game warden was an idiot and would not take any story even the truth so yeah we're fighting it and we will win Thanks for all the stupid comments Instead of help
1076622,akaShag,2021-10-13 18:14:00,2073,"This is the Internet, Sunshine.  Ask a question and you will get lots of opinions and comments that might not be what you wanted.  Just sayin'..."
1076623,AKRISONER,2021-10-13 18:36:00,5558,"Step 1. Makes Internet Thread Step 2. Gets Replies Step 3. Sarcastically thanks everyone for their ""stupid"" comments on their internet forum thread. you cant make this kinda stuff up lmao"
1076625,kuhaman,2021-10-13 19:27:00,503,One detail you are missing is why the C O's were even there????
1076626,kuhaman,2021-10-13 19:31:00,503,"Stopped them, what?  Were they transporting the freezer?? lol"
1076496,Manfy,2021-10-07 23:07:00,7,"Hey everyone ! I need your help There is a situation I need to get clarified here Both my friends have fishing licenses and they left there fish up at there parents cottage, well there parents got caught by a game warden and are getting charged for possession over limit. They lawyer says for my friends to sign an afidavid saying they left there fish up there. Should I tell them not to sign as charged might be less for there parents but now come back on them for leaving there catch there ???  "
1076497,Fisherman,2021-10-07 23:35:00,7201,"I suspect there's more to the story than shown.  If A and B left their fish at the parents cottage, the parents can possess the legal limit of each person giving it to them.  No licence required.  How many did they leave?"
1076498,Terry,2021-10-07 23:41:00,14456,"Even if you gift fish  to a person that person can not possess over a limit so from the little info you gave, they are guilty"
1076499,Manfy,2021-10-08 00:05:00,7,They didn't gift any they just left there 4 fish up there and went home
1076500,Terry,2021-10-08 00:22:00,14456,"And the home owners are in possession mom not saying it’s right but it is the way the law is a judge May believe they were going to come back for them and go easy on them but I wouldn’t count on it we were told that if we wanted one car to transport all our fish in the cooler from a fishing camp  while some people were in other vehicles, we would have to have them packaged in individual bags sealed and with name address and phone number . Types of fish  and numbers  of fish "
1076503,Manfy,2021-10-08 02:06:00,7,Thank you helps alot
1076560,akaShag,2021-10-10 23:58:00,2073,"WHY would the game wardens be checking out somebody's cottage???  COs have a lot of work to do, without checking up on cottage owners who may have somebody else's fish in their possession....and BTW why would they suspect this?  Definitely more to this story than what is written here. "
1076562,John Bacon,2021-10-11 02:19:00,3277,But two people each leaving a daily limit of fish would not put them over the possession limit…
1076564,irishfield,2021-10-11 03:53:00,26272,Unless they already had their freezer full...
1076568,Terry,2021-10-11 12:39:00,14456,exactly. Even a couple of fish of their own  would do it
1076570,glen,2021-10-11 13:26:00,2641,How many fish over limit?   	if it’s a lot if could be a big fine.   	you say the parents were not over limit until other fish were left so two extra limits? I would not sign anything because that doesn’t take away that the law was broke.   	they broke the law and are guilty.   	pay fine.   	id like to here the rest of the story.  Did they pull the Gill nets.
1076571,akaShag,2021-10-11 13:29:00,2073,"OR if they have no fishing licence, AND are not yet 65 years old......"
1076572,Fisherman,2021-10-11 13:34:00,7201,Maybe someone else got tired of the over harvesting and made a call.
1076574,John Bacon,2021-10-11 13:57:00,3277,"Actually, a license is not required to possess fish.  I think that there must be more than two limits of fish involved here.  Plus, the CO/Game Warden must have suspected something in order for them to inspect the freezer to begin with.  I suspect that there is a little more to the story than what we are being told."
1076575,akaShag,2021-10-11 14:02:00,2073,"I did not know that one could possess game fish without a licence, but that makes sense.  If I give a feed of fish to a friend who is shut-in due to a health condition, she does not need a licence.  Not that I asked her about this.... But yes there is more to this story.............."
1076578,porkpie,2021-10-11 15:14:00,2521,"You should not tell them anything.  The lawyer they supposedly have should advise them.  I've seen plenty of f@#ckery in my day, and it sounds like some is afoot."
1076584,Manfy,2021-10-11 16:09:00,7,There were no nets its a cottage for family other family left there limits there so one person got caught with all fish Unfortunately they were not based and tagged right
1076585,Manfy,2021-10-11 16:12:00,7,There was no news evolved It's a family cottage so multiple people stay there There is a deep freezer so instead of taking the fish home they left them there and headed home is it ilegal to leave ur fish there if u have a fishing license do they have go always go where you go
1076587,Big Cliff,2021-10-11 16:52:00,6899,Exactly how many fish over limit are we talking about? Something had to triger the CO to investigate so either someone complained or they observed something that made them suspicious.
1076588,Fisherman,2021-10-11 16:55:00,7201,If you leave multiple possessions in the same freezer then they must be packaged to be able to make an accurate count and labelled with individual ownership.
1076589,Chris J,2021-10-11 17:44:00,44,Quite the story.
1076590,glen,2021-10-11 18:40:00,2641,What started the  investigation?
1076602,Manfy,2021-10-12 20:59:00,7,They were fishing in a small town in  Ontario and the game warden that stoped them also lives there apparently he is well known there
1076603,Fisherman,2021-10-12 21:38:00,7201,"Somebody must have told him something, they just don't randomly check peoples freezers"
1076604,glen,2021-10-12 22:38:00,2641,I guess the warden thinks they are guilty. Hopefully it’s not a big fine. Pay it and move on.
