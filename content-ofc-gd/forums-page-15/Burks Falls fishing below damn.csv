I thought this would be a good area, but weâ€™ve been skunked every time. Anyone familiar with this area and know if there are fish here? Or does anyone have any tips on where to take a four year old shoreline fishing in this area?  thanks mike"

The river is moving fast there but off the right hand side of the bridge there is an eddy. I caught nonstop fish out of that little pool right off the bridge. They were only rockbass, sunfish and some tiny smallies...but any kid would be fine with that! If I remember correctly you can carefully walk down and fish from the shore too...I just chose to fish off the bridge. Worm under bobber with 3 feet of line gets em every time."
