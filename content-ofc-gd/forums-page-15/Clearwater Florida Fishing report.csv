Outside the usual Whiting, Jackfish and Catfish off the surf I was able to get out on the boat for some nearshore for some Snook and Bull Redfish hunting. While the Bulls weren't having any of what I would throw, the Snook were on fire! Landed two including my personal best 42inches and got cut off by about 5 more as they dove and broke me off before I could bring them up. Awesome time and cant get to go back in May for some Tarpon!  "

1076695,Toronto_Angler,2021-10-17 19:39:00,698,Would be worth it to see you bring in a Tarpon in the toon!
1076696,misfish,2021-10-17 20:45:00,29133,"Bring the video camera. New, OLD MAN AND THE SEA movie. LOL"
1076715,BillM,2021-10-19 18:16:00,17367,"Awesome! Love shore fishing the Clearwater area, you never know what you're going to end up with.¬† ¬†How are the charter rates down there these days?"
1076716,Toronto_Angler,2021-10-19 19:55:00,698,"Wasn't bad but also wasn't cheap lol, 475USD plus tip for a morning for a single. I think thats about the going rate for singles or doubles. Fun day all around"
1076719,Rizzo,2021-10-19 23:47:00,4754,Great pictures!
1076724,mamona,2021-10-20 14:07:00,597,"Same here... 475USD would keep me by the shore, very pricey"
1076725,AKRISONER,2021-10-20 15:18:00,5558,"Amazing photos. Always wanted to catch a snook, haven‚Äôt managed one yet"
1076728,akaShag,2021-10-20 18:13:00,2073,"me neither.¬† Mind you, I have never fished for them.............üòÅ"
1076729,aplumma,2021-10-20 18:51:00,6896,You can fish for them but I got a better chance of catching a freshwater shark¬† than you getting a Snook up North. lol
