I thought maybe it was a snag,but after landing,the white sac was in the corner of the mouth. Crazy runs.  Funny how one river system is starting to transition from salmon to steelhead and another still has a good run of salmon still flowing in. After the rain this morning with the south wind blowing ,there was wave after wave, coming up."
