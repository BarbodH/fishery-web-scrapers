1076801,Spiel,2021-10-26 23:05:00,9065,Well it's definitely outdoor related. Deer antler supplied by a dear friend (as well as one of my machine lathes) for his next custom rod build. 	This is the progress so far.......        
1076802,North Channel Cottages,2021-10-27 02:14:00,18,"That looks great, how many hours you figure to complete it?"
1076803,Big Cliff,2021-10-27 10:02:00,6899,So beautiful ❤
1076806,John,2021-10-27 12:41:00,2956,"Awesome Chris, as usual!"
1076807,Spiel,2021-10-27 12:44:00,9065,There's about 3 hours in the reel seat and butt cap.
1076808,Ralph Field,2021-10-27 12:44:00,1018,Always stunning work !
1076809,mitch seguin,2021-10-27 12:48:00,98,Looking forward to seeing the completed rod.
1076810,mamona,2021-10-27 14:12:00,597,Same here. I am impressed.
1076814,Bill Shearer,2021-10-27 20:10:00,456,"Well done as usual, Chris! "
1076816,misfish,2021-10-27 20:58:00,29133,"This part of the seat will be the signature . You could of turned the whole thing down and just had bone, but with this left, that is very very cool. Really really like that Chris. Fly rod ? "
1076818,Spiel,2021-10-27 21:09:00,9065,Thanks Brian. It's going to be strapped to a 13' CTS float rod.
1076820,misfish,2021-10-27 21:42:00,29133,Nice
1076834,Ron,2021-10-28 20:47:00,1683,Very impressive on how you got the portion of untouched antler to showcase the seat. Will you ever get the aroma of burnt bone out of the shop?
1076844,Spiel,2021-10-28 23:04:00,9065,"Thanks Pal. I get lucky sometimes and the stink, well I can assure you, you don't get used to it.  lol"
