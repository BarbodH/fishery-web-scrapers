514221,Bernie,2010-10-23 15:49:00,3190,There are marine batteries and deep cycle marine batteries. Differently designed. Deep cycle are generally used for trolling motors. It must be a deep cycle to be able to withstand a deep discharge/recharge. The plates on the inside have a different design to be able to withstand this.
514554,splashhopper,2010-10-25 00:58:00,2931,"So, it was TOO warm to try out the new bed heater.  It only got down to 10C where I was for the weekend. I was plenty warm enough in my sleeping bag.  I did buy the alligator clip/cigarette lighter adapter at CT for $5.95.  Will provide an update on the next cold snap when I need the heat.  Thanks"
514093,splashhopper,2010-10-23 01:15:00,2931,"AS the trouts season is on for me now, I will be van camping in some cold nights.  I will be using my sleeping bag that is rated for -20c along with a a foam pad to go under it. I also bring an old comforter just in case.  I am wondering about using my old slip on car seat heater that I plug in to the cigarette lighter. It has two settings and works like a charm.  I was thinking about putting it between the foam pad and the sleeping bag. I can plug it in to the rear plug accessories plug in my van as well.  What I am wondering though is about draining the battery in the van down. It is only 30 days old and I know these are not meant for draining fully like a marine battery.  So, should I re-wire the seat cover with two alligator clips and hook it up to my 12volt marine battery or should I just plug it in to the cigarette lighter and then boost the battery off the marine battery if need be?  Thanks for the support.  Splashhopper"
514095,GBW,2010-10-23 01:22:00,8460,As a safety thing I wouldn't bother with that heater unless you know it's going to get DAMN cold.  If it does get that bad then use the marine batt.  but that's just me.
514097,BillM,2010-10-23 01:25:00,17367,That little seat heater isn't going to make a dent in a car battery.
514105,xkempx,2010-10-23 01:38:00,84,"alligator clips and hook it up to marine battery....It will hold a better chrage for days/nights...If boost from marine battery to car batt. it will drop every time to 10.2, - 9.6 volts... My guess"
514108,smally21,2010-10-23 01:43:00,993,"yes, you can"
514111,splashhopper,2010-10-23 01:45:00,2931,"hmmmm???  mixed results so far.  The seat heater can make my backside sweat on the coldest of days, with the regular heater on of course.  I am just looking to keep the chill off with this pad is all, not looking for toasty warm  BTW, they have the exact same on one on sale at Crappy Tire this week for $9.995 if you are getting older like me and like to warm your vehicle up for a few minutes and then sit on a warm   seat."
514113,irishfield,2010-10-23 01:48:00,26272,What I always did camping... I had two marine batteries in the back of the vehicle. While driving they were plugged into the cig lighter charging.. at destination they ran our portable cooler until we could get plugged in or thru a night if necessary. Moving on the next day batteries get recharged.. repeat.
514117,splashhopper,2010-10-23 01:53:00,2931," Did you attach them to the marine battery with alligator clips? Or is there an adapter that I can buy at CT to plug the seat in to and then to the marine battery ? AS you may guess, I am not very sound on electrical practices. Grout and tile I know a thing or two about. lol"
514118,irishfield,2010-10-23 01:57:00,26272,What I had was... a female plug-in on the marine batteries ( ie: an external cig lighter socket). When driving I had a dual male end cord that would plug into the vehicle socket and the battery socket. When parked... you unplug the (charging) cord and then plug your male cord from the heater you want to use into the marine batteries socket. If they are dead come morning.. plug that dual ended cord back in AFTER starting the vehicle.
514120,splashhopper,2010-10-23 02:01:00,2931, That sounds very simple to do.  Could I buy those plugs at CT or at princess auto then ?
514122,irishfield,2010-10-23 02:03:00,26272,Defintely CTC.. princess auto most likely as well for less money.
514124,mercman,2010-10-23 02:05:00,7054, a little bit too much info here Ron  happines is a warm tushy
514125,Muskieman,2010-10-23 02:06:00,2472,"Bang On!!   Randy    That didn't work..  I tried to ""multi qutoe"" XKEMPX  & Irish's 2nd post."
514126,splashhopper,2010-10-23 02:07:00,2931,  Thanks Irishfield....  Ia ppreciate the quick and simple answers
514127,splashhopper,2010-10-23 02:08:00,2931,"  Kinda pasty, eh !"
514129,mercman,2010-10-23 02:13:00,7054,  you're allowed. i got heated seats in my ranger.500 dollar option but i'm old too so i like a warm butt too
514137,SlowPoke,2010-10-23 02:35:00,2984,"Charging your marine batt from the accessory outlet is fine but when you disconnect it and hook up the seat heater, make sure you have a fuse inline.... probably 20 amp but check what the seat heater calls for."
514140,irishfield,2010-10-23 02:42:00,26272,It should have one right in the male plug in socket..
514150,SlowPoke,2010-10-23 03:00:00,2984,Yes but he was also talking about aligator clips direct to the battery.
514153,irishfield,2010-10-23 03:09:00,26272,Yah.. I hear ya! Hard wire that female cig socket to the batteries wing nuts.. Fuse holder should be in the male plug in end (or inline in the wire as you suggested Brian) to the heater. The fuse for the vehicle cig lighter socket will cover the charging wires.
514176,splashhopper,2010-10-23 11:32:00,2931,now that is what I call service... thank you to both.... i will try to do this today and post my results.... hope i don't look like a poptart after I hook it up
514177,splashhopper,2010-10-23 11:38:00,2931,Thanks again Irishfield and also to Slowpoke.. I am heading out now and will let you know if I turned in to a poptart after hooking this deal up !
514178,splashhopper,2010-10-23 11:39:00,2931,  I just tried to as well   .... will try to learn that feature on a later date... going fishing now
514184,Fisherman,2010-10-23 13:08:00,7201," You have answered your own question, starting batteries are NOT meant to be used as a power source to drain down, use the marine DC batteries and recharge either while driving or when you get back home."
514209,skeeter,2010-10-23 14:57:00,1907,princess auto has both of the extensions you are looking for and cheaper then ctc.
