514375,Raf,2010-10-24 03:13:00,3495,
514378,misfish,2010-10-24 03:41:00,29133,Im hooked and waiting for the REAL HURT to come.  Thanks G.
514380,Toddyc20,2010-10-24 04:03:00,141,got it working now.  thank you for the help Gerritt
514381,misfish,2010-10-24 04:10:00,29133,"How do they think this is the biggest fight for Lesner? Stop trying to sell the sport. Carwin was the closet tough guy,and he didnt do the job."
514382,misfish,2010-10-24 04:17:00,29133,"Here we go.   IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIT,S TIME."
514384,misfish,2010-10-24 04:26:00,29133,"WOW,Im in AWWWWWWWW.  Didnt expect that."
514385,Gerritt,2010-10-24 04:29:00,6129,me either... Wow! see that cut.. ouch!
514388,Twocoda,2010-10-24 04:40:00,4130,ha ha ha ha ..wonder how Lesner likes the real fighting now ...back to the WWE entertainment for him ...Cain is a fighter for sure ...and Lesner didnt stand a chance
514389,Raf,2010-10-24 04:42:00,3495,"cain did good  maybe learned something from the carwin/lesnar fight; don't get too excited and gas - instead, pick your shots. lesnar does not like getting hit.  back to the wwe brock.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDmdf46JZZ0&feature=player_embedded"
514390,xkempx,2010-10-24 04:42:00,84,Yep you said it right......
514394,Twocoda,2010-10-24 04:53:00,4130, i could have swore i seen Lesner tearing up out of his good eye ...god am i glad that clown is dethrowned ...honestly i thought it was a joke to even let him in the UFC without even working his way up for a title shot
514397,Cudz,2010-10-24 04:58:00,2652,Cain is fast and strong despite being a small heavyweight. I knew as soon as Lesner Bull rushed him at the start and did not get the takedown it was going to be a tough battle.
514398,Raf,2010-10-24 05:10:00,3495,
514475,Terry,2010-10-24 18:54:00,14456,"yeah, that was disappointing.... I thought it was going to be a tough fight for him but..WOW"
514477,bucktail,2010-10-24 18:56:00,1857,The results of this fight will hurt his career more then the physical injuries. His opponenets will see he has an average chin at best and will not be as intimidated as in the past. Life just got alot harder for Brock Lesnar in MMA after this.
514479,misfish,2010-10-24 19:17:00,29133,Hes a ground and pound wrestler.It didnt go that way for him. Big guy with no chin.
514566,Nipfisher,2010-10-25 01:23:00,2449,That cut may be dangerous now. His cheek could continue to rip below or above the scar tissue every fight from now on. There was a guy on my hockey team whose chin was a mess from from so many cuts on the same scar.
514572,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-10-25 01:32:00,0,Where can I see the fight?
