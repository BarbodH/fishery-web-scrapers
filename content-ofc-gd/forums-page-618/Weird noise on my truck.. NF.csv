513624,jedimaster,2010-10-21 16:33:00,3472,"just get some aftermarket headers, they are cheaper than new exhaust manifolds"
513640,POLLIWOGG,2010-10-21 17:26:00,835,"Pair of stainless shorty headers  of E-bay for under $300 Stock exhaust will fit but you have to screw with the flange on the pipe, headers are bigger. Better still Couple of Cherry bombs and your good to go.  Climb under it after driving it and check the universals, the caps will be hot if they're starting to go.  Brake adjuster cable falls apart and gets ground up on old F250 fords, take it apart and throw them away. Parking brake cables stick and drag the brakes, throw them away too."
513642,DRIFTER_016,2010-10-21 17:35:00,10439,  Not that there's anything wrong with that.
513648,JohnF,2010-10-21 18:03:00,3494," You beat me. manifold was the first thing that occurred to me. As for where the sound seems to be coming from I've decided that if it sounds like a rear end noise, then it's for sure from the front, and if it sounds left, it's for sure right.  JF"
513691,Gerritt,2010-10-21 20:32:00,6129,"wow you guys are funny today! Don't think I would suit the pink gloves as much as Joe did however  Anyways I have taken it to a buddy that is a backyard mechanic but really knows his stuff. He believes it is a U-Joint that is the culprit, based on the sound alone and the vibration of the truck at highway speeds..  We did not see a crack in the manifold..  it is funny.. if I pull away from a stopped position slowly.. I do not hear the noise.. but if I give it a little gas the it is! tick tick tick.. and it is VERY noticeable.  John, you are correct.. it sounds like the rear.. but it is in the front... had this same issue with brake squel last year.. I swore it was the rear.. but alas it was indeed the front.  from what I have been told U-Joints are a PIA on Ford trucks.. the part is cheap.. labour not so..  G"

The one built later in the year has obvious thinner metal parts, broke both drive shafts and rear shackles. Had to rob the older one for parts.

514083,vinnimon,2010-10-23 00:35:00,2593," The ticking in the engine usually a bad plug or cracked head in #3 or #7 cyl! Ive seen happen on fords 4.6 ltr plenty of times. Right bank 3rd cyl, head crack. Starting at the spark plug hole! The crack will have a circular pattern!Some times blowing the plug out. I think gerrit has a u joint or slip yoke issue.Thats if his rear end is shacking!"
515133,Bernie,2010-10-27 02:56:00,3190,Sorry I missed this Gerritt. I was away hunting last week. I'd say U joint as well from your description.
515143,4x4bassin,2010-10-27 04:04:00,1025,I had the same problem with mine and it was a rear u joint .

She is 8 years old.  and the brakes were done last year or so..  I noticed a sound lately I have never heard before..  it is a loud tick tick tick, when I accelerate from a stopped position.. to my ears it seems to be coming from the rear..  it is loud and pronounced.. but seems to dissipate after I get to 10-15k or so..  any thoughts?

512581,Whitespinnerbait,2010-10-17 22:14:00,2038,I'll bet the Farm its a bad U joint....most likely the one at the diff
512585,misfish,2010-10-17 22:27:00,29133,"Maybe it,s a buum.A what?A buum.Ya mean a boam? Yes,a buum."
512586,danbouck,2010-10-17 22:30:00,4380,A squeeking is usually a u joint but in my experiance a ticking is usually a cylinder missing (bad plug)
512587,irishfield,2010-10-17 22:34:00,26272,Didn't even think of it 'till dan said that.  2 years ago when Terry and I left Fort Erie after fishing Muskie.. I had a tick.. thought it was a collapsed lifter as it would go away after awhile.  My right side exhaust manifold was cracked right in the center... once it heated up and expanded it would stop ticking!  Look thru your right wheel well Gerritt and see if your exhaust manifold is cracked. Check the other side toooo.  Your F150 has the same triton as mine (2003)..
512589,misfish,2010-10-17 22:42:00,29133," Didnt both sides have cracks Wayne?  G, also check the manifold bolts.Mine corroded to nothing and did this aswell. I was having fun in my first post.I should know better.........."

512592,misfish,2010-10-17 22:56:00,29133," My left one went first at 120k then the right at 134k.And yea,they had to be drilled and eze outted aswell."

Two weeks ago started as a tic again, pulling the bassboat out of the water and the tic is now sounding like a tank. Under closer inspection the right side is pooched and needs to be replaced. But not till i;m done hauling my firewood. It sounds pretty cool tho haha"
512607,Ron,2010-10-17 23:38:00,1683,4.6 engine = cracked exhaust manifold - driver side.
512609,HTHM,2010-10-17 23:41:00,4082,"Turn the radio up louder....... Another possibility is the rear end differential. Check the fluid, and that drivetrain is bulletproof, my van had 427,000 on it when I sold it."
512625,Fisherman,2010-10-18 00:28:00,7201,"All those ""flawless fords"" and the truth slowly comes out, crack manifolds, cracked brake drums, collapsed lifter, and a buum. No that's what it does just before it totally quit..buum."
512626,irishfield,2010-10-18 00:31:00,26272,LOL... you know it's the only issue I've had with my 2003. One cracked exhaust manifold. I can't even come up with a good reason to trade it in on a new anything.  And I'm not easy on mine.. here's what we were doing to it Monday.   
512629,Gerritt,2010-10-18 00:34:00,6129,Great... what am I looking at to have the exhaust manifold replaced? any estimates before I take it in?
512632,irishfield,2010-10-18 00:38:00,26272,You should be able to see it really easy thru the rubber flaps in the wheel well.. especially in the dark with it running.  I think mine was around $700 for one side new manifold and bolts.

513608,Roy,2010-10-21 15:31:00,13728," Reminds me of the story of the guy who gets pulled over by the police and the police tells him "" Do you realise that your wife fell outta the truck a few miles back?"" To which he replies "" Oh, thank God, I thought I was going deaf!"""
