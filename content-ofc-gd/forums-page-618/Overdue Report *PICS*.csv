Been taking some time off to look for full time work as the guiding thing has slowed significantly since labour day.  Had a few guides in the past few weeks and the fishing has been steady.  It's not on fire anymore, but we're managing decent numbers of good fish still.  Mostly dragging tubes and dropshots in the 25-40 foot range now.  Fished another tournament on Georgian Bay last Saturday with a good friend Brian Gardy and we managed to take another 2nd place finish... I forget who pointed out my apparent fondness of the 2nd place this year but its becoming more and more apparent. I had our club classic at Lake of Bays on Thanksgiving Saturday.  Big fish were hard to come by but we got lots of fish throwing topwaters which is fun this time of year and we placed 3rd. I'll attach a bunch of fish porn to make up for the lack of report.  I'll offer half price charters to the forum members starting Oct 30 through to the end of season.... Good fishin!      "

I have friends and family - how much will it cost them to come along?  Thanks. PM me back if you don't want to / cannot answer on the forum."

514502,steverowbotham,2010-10-24 21:58:00,1800," Dont remember exact weights, we only had around 13lbs and winners were under 15.  Not many big fish to come by but lots of scrappy 2-2.5's and some lakers to boot"
