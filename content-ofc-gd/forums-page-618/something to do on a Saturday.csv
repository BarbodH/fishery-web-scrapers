514737,Terry,2010-10-25 19:52:00,14456,LOL that's the one  I can't remember the name of it it has a familiar scent
514783,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-10-25 22:48:00,0,Rice lake??
514789,splashhopper,2010-10-25 23:05:00,2931, That would be better than returning from a guided tour by the Steelyourstuffcre.com guys!
514271,Terry,2010-10-23 20:51:00,14456,"I woke up and saw the wind was down and it wasn't raining so I hooked up the boat and went to a secret local lake. I can't say the name but I heard "" it has more people fishing it every year, than all people fishing all the lakes in Manitoba "" I fished for bass and caught bass  I fished for perch and caught lots of perch  I fished for pike.........did I mention I caught lots of perch   the bass were biting pretty well as long as you cranked slowly, I guess I shouldn't say what lure I was using I heard some people don't like too much info given     tons of perch on secret baits      the average size was about the one in this picture but I can't say just how big they were      I guess I shouldn't say how deep I was fishing but I can say that my HDS5 was working well       it was a nice day on the water             there was a memorial of the guy guy that drowned recently, it made it very difficult to launch the boat by myself, but got it done with out disturbing the items left by friends  when I came back in someone was arranging the flowers and taking care of all the items, then 2 more came to pay their respects I guess it's a good way to let the family know he was loved             "

514666,Mike Pike,2010-10-25 16:00:00,1332,"I don't usually ask this Terry, becuase I know people are very protective of their spots and techniques, but could you please tell me what you were using and the lake you were on?  Please feel free to PM me.  Thanks."
514699,Terry,2010-10-25 18:28:00,14456,"I don't think it would be right to say I was on simcoe and I wouldn't even consider telling people I used a 2.5"" gulp minnow on a 1/4"" jig and the rapala DT for bass.........  so I will not PM you with the info"
514705,Headhunter,2010-10-25 18:37:00,5703,"Terry, based on the pics, I can just barely tell that you are using some kind of hand cream to negate the effects of wind and rain on those supple hands... care to PM me the brand? HH ps... I still have those pink gloves if your interested!"
