I am fishing as a co-angler against 199 other co-anglers ! This is my first year of competitive bass fishing and I only have 4 other tournaments under my belt so needless to say, this is a pretty big deal to me ! haha First place in this tourny is a 198VX Ranger with a 200 E-Tec !  I guess I'm asking for some wishes of luck from our great OFC community !!! haha and I promise, If I come back with the boat behind my truck .... all of you are invited to fish with me !!!!!!!!! hahah  Ill report back in 5 days !!!  Talk to you soon !"

514906,Lunker777,2010-10-26 12:35:00,866,"Thanks everyone !!!!  I made it back safe and sound.... with out a boat though ! hahah  Day 1 - Good partner, we travelled 79 mile to our spot... so 158 miles round trip ! haha thats a looooooooooooonnnng trip on the boat ! The fish didnt turn on till late, we only had about an hour left to fish... we both only managed 1 keeper. But that one keeper was good enough for 48th place out of 152 boats. 2 lbs 3 oz. ! hahahah  Day 2 - Well.... its tough to stay positive when you meet your boater for the day and he asks... "" Do YOU know anywhere to fish on this lake ??? "" ....hmmm.... needless to say it was a pretty slow day... basically we studied a map while waiting to take off and fished areas we thought might be good. I blanked on the second day, as did my boater.... so home I came !!!  All in all it was a good time !!! It was great to fish a new lake, well two new lakes... KY Lake and Barkley Lake. Resevoir fishing is a whole new ball game and I will be back."
