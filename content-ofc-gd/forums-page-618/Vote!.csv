514590,John Bacon,2010-10-25 02:15:00,3277,I beat the crowds and voted last Sunday.
514604,irishfield,2010-10-25 03:13:00,26272,I should have done that John.. as matter of fact the whole family should of. Due to unforseen circumstances we're all in Toronto for the next few days and can't vote tomorrow. Sure gonna suck if our own 27 year old son loses a seat on Penetang council by coming up 5 votes short..... (he's not even going to be able to vote for himself)
514617,snoil,2010-10-25 11:44:00,139,"Gerritt.Not sure about Hamilton but i do know who i'm voting for  mayor of Tronto,  councillor in ward 6 and school trustee."
514635,Governator,2010-10-25 13:30:00,879,I got an automated message last night @ 8:03PM from the current mayor here looking to get reelected.  Is that not illegal?  I thought automated phone calls & telemarketing could only be until 6PM on weekends.
514636,ehg,2010-10-25 13:30:00,2666,"Joe Pants, just sayin'"
514704,jbailey,2010-10-25 18:37:00,866, agreed.
