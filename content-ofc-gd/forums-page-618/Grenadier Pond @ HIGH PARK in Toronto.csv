514473,fisher12,2010-10-24 18:41:00,81," No, it's just that it's one of the closer fishing spots to me. So I can go a few times next year, but I am trying out different spots because I am pretty new to fishing, any information about fishing spots in my area would be greatly appreciated (Mississauga and surrounding areas)  The furthest I went to was Lake Scugog so far, but planning to go to Lake simcoe soon for ice fishing in February."
315386,rbaquial,2009-03-10 00:14:00,968,Just wondering if anyones been around the area to see what the water is like.  If its still iced-over or not? I plan on heading there tomorrow morning...  Thanks!
315388,ADB,2009-03-10 00:19:00,444,"I haven't been around  there to see, but a smaller lake I checked out was still frozen, even along the shoreline.  What are you going to be fishing for, anyways?  Pike?"
315408,rbaquial,2009-03-10 00:45:00,968,"Yeah, I'm hoping to.... (Pike)"
315509,SERG,2009-03-10 03:41:00,10,"Hello. I never been there , can you fish from shore? and what kind of fish is there ? Thanks."
315512,rbaquial,2009-03-10 03:51:00,968,"Yeah, there are a lot of places you can fish from shore - supposedly that place holds some bass and pike...(depending on season)... if you send me a PM along with your EMAIL ADDRESS, I can send you a .PDF file of places in Toronto that are good for 'Shore Fisherman' - its on the MNR website too."
315573,Bitsmith2k,2009-03-10 12:19:00,396,looked frozen over when i went by this morning..  be careful
315582,capt bruce,2009-03-10 13:04:00,820,"Was there yesterday working and its still frozen ,(we're doing alot of inprovements to the pond and building a classroom , lunch area ,for students to come and study the pond after we finish,this will be the first hay bail constructed building in toronto) but the ice is thinning around the shore wont last much longer . we are doing lots of work on the pond and surrounding area and I made sure I used my imput to make sure when we're finished the pond will have 3 very nice shoals for bass spawning and more ares for access for fishing. working in Storm water management has its good side ."
315588,rbaquial,2009-03-10 13:22:00,968,"Awesome stuff Capt. Bruce!  Can't wait to hit the area once its all complete!  PS: As you can tell, I didn't end up going fishing this morning!"
315604,highdrifter,2009-03-10 14:10:00,2534,"See it every morning on my way to the office... She's still frozen over.  Looked sketchy too.  If you're planning on heading that way, ya might as well check out the lake side.  You'll have open water even in the sheltered areas, where you'll most likely find them.  Any flats with good weed growth will hold pike this time of year too.  Happy piking!  HD"
326391,Anatz,2009-04-05 01:02:00,74,"The ice is out but the fish has not moved in yet. Late April, you would be able to catch sunfish, crappie and perch.  I'm developing a website dedicated to this pond since I go fishing there like 4 times a week during the summer.  www.grenadierpond.com"
326408,rbaquial,2009-04-05 01:45:00,968,"w00t!! Awesome Anatz!!  EDIT: You gotta let us know when its up!  I've never fished outta that pond, but would like to give it a shot sometime."
326539,Anatz,2009-04-05 14:28:00,74,I'm actually going to try the pond today using pieces of shrimp. Hopefully they would start biting by now. I'll let you know how it goes
326655,RuNnYoOzE,2009-04-05 19:19:00,270,"I would love to check out the pond but seriously my local has loads of open water to fish...seems crazy to drive to Toronto to fish , unless it is to meet some people...always nice to fish with someone!"
326719,Weeds,2009-04-05 22:40:00,782,"I thought pike was closed till May, no?"
514259,fisher12,2010-10-23 20:16:00,81,"What are the best lures/ baits for this pond? I used worms and a bobber, only caught tiny bluegill."
514260,fisher12,2010-10-23 20:17:00,81,Did anyone ever try SouthWest pond (the pond west of Grenadier pond)?
514279,Roy,2010-10-23 21:38:00,13728,"Fisher12, don't push your luck."
514283,Guest gbfisher,2010-10-23 21:45:00,0,"Heyyyy,,,,Little buddy.   Glad ya took my advie with the bobber and worm set up. It is fishing after all and ya don't always catch the big one. Good on ya for giving it a try....Keep at it.   "
514287,misfish,2010-10-23 22:13:00,29133,I remember the peacoaks and lamas.I was 7 or 8 at the time. Feed the ducks in the small pond there and also watched guys with remote power boats.
514318,fisher12,2010-10-24 00:28:00,81, Honestly worms are the only thing I ever caught fish on. And I've actually been using worms for months. I actually was referring to when I went fishing 4 or 5 weeks ago.
514321,Beans,2010-10-24 00:48:00,3339," When I was a young lad playing hooky from grade school, we used to get some minnows there using an old piece of curtain to use in the big pond...  Back then (60 years ago) we called it Catfish pond...don't know why, never saw any catfish in our net...   "
514334,misfish,2010-10-24 01:20:00,29133," So I seen peacoaks and lamas,you seen dinasours?"
514355,livinisfishin,2010-10-24 02:13:00,661,Blah
514439,Guest gbfisher,2010-10-24 14:33:00,0,  Worms are 'it' when yer young and still learning. Maybe you could hit your old boy up for some allowance to purchase some lures. Although little fish will still hit big lures as well. Stick with ole faithfull. Worms and bobbers rule... You fish the pond often do you?  I was at the park last week on a feild trip with my kids class. Just about your age....
514450,Beans,2010-10-24 15:28:00,3339,  Sheeeesh...Thanks Brian...Just 'cause I can remember when Yonge Street was a forest...  Respect your elders you young whippersnapper !...
