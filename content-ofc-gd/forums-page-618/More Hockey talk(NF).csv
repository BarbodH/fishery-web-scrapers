513933,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-10-22 17:22:00,0,"Man the leafs looked a little tired! They didn't pick it up until the third(Thats two games in a row).  They got outshot for the first time. Even though the ranger defense was blocking shots galore.  The only reason we didn't smoke the Rangers last game was one word. Lundqvist. We should have ate them with their back up goalie. They don't even have Drury!  The two goals scored by the rangers were a result of weak man to man coverage. As I stated before. The defense have to play the body more. They were walking into our endzone with ease. We couldn't get into their endzone because their defense men would get physical at the blueline.  Thats why our powerplay is having a hard time setting up. But once they do, it looks good. They just have to work on the onetimers. Not enough shots or opportunities(Rebounds).  We have to start mixing up the lines. Did I hear correct on the TV? Versteeg was on the 3rd line in Chicago?"
513945,jbailey,2010-10-22 18:02:00,866,"i don't know whats goin on with phaneuf he can't seem to get his shots off, and the transition play last night was really slow, hopefully they can pick it up next game."
513958,Kinger,2010-10-22 18:48:00,351,"I noticed for the last two games they have been shooting into the opponent's shin pads and pants.  Gotta get the puck to the net, then good things happen."
514012,bassmaster4,2010-10-22 21:11:00,801, i agree with you lebda is not looking good at all. I am getting frustrated watching him play he makes poor decisions and takes untimely penalties.
514027,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-10-22 22:18:00,0,"Funny how you guys should mention that. My brother, and he watches hockey religiously(Not only leafs but every single game). And he said the same thing.  I dont know what the heck he was doing on the ice in overtime to begin with!Thats Wilson's error. You cant really blame the kid for a bad ref call. And he did get another stupid penalty yesterday.The guy is just an average bottom of the barrel, NHL'er.....  But with what I seen? You cant blame one guy. You have to blame the team......"
514303,tb4me,2010-10-23 23:22:00,3295,This is a good thing.
514349,jediangler,2010-10-24 02:03:00,1923,OUCH!!! outshot 40 - 15.
514353,bassmaster4,2010-10-24 02:10:00,801,"poor defensive play by the leafs tonight. way too many odd man rushes given up on bad pinches by the defensemen i noticed that against the rangers as well, last three games have been hard to watch. Has me thinking what if those first four games were just a fluke."
514363,jedimaster,2010-10-24 02:41:00,3472,well it was a vety lack luster performance tonight. i am hopibg this is not a sign if things to come. i hope they are in a funk and not comming down to earth. if they play every game like the last 3 versus the first three we are in for another rough season
514364,ontariofisherman,2010-10-24 02:41:00,52,I would say there roll has come to an end
514387,jediangler,2010-10-24 04:39:00,1923,"I think the ""roll"" is just picking up speed, as they go downhill   ."
514432,JohnF,2010-10-24 13:27:00,3494, One of the announcers made what might be an important observation last night about Versteeg. He averaged 5 minutes less per game with Chicago. Factor that in with the increased presssure on him to play to first line expectations and it might help to explain why he's struggling. Or maybe it's just another lame excuse. I dunno.  JF
514441,trevy727,2010-10-24 14:55:00,351,"The leafs blew their load early, they're done! Where's the hero Clarke Macwho been for last couple games? They aren't going to make the playoffs again. Go Rangers Go!"
514499,lookinforwalleye,2010-10-24 21:34:00,4399,Didn`t take long for the wheels to fall off the bandwagon!!!
514535,muskymatt,2010-10-25 00:02:00,2608,Bwahhahahahhah....aaaaaaaaahhahahhahahah..ohohoh.....hahahahahaha...bwahahahahhahahahahah....  I'm crying here....bwahahahahahhahah...   This thread is sooooooo good I'm going to copy and frame it and hang it on my office wall.....bwahahahahhaha  what happened to the parade??????????????
514543,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-10-25 00:26:00,0," Gunnarson didn't prove any better. He played the puck and got burned twice, and Phaneuf? Whats his plus minus now? Not playing the body is to blame for almost(if not every) goal.  We're gonna make the playoffs. We just have to make a few adjustments. Wilson's gonna go soon, and Phaneuf has to learn to play the body. He does have a good one timer though.  Musky Matt. What place are your Senators in again, in our division? Oh ya. LAST!!!LOL Where are the leafs? FIRST!  We should beat Florida but Boston will decide what kind of a team we are."
514547,muskymatt,2010-10-25 00:35:00,2608,  Make the playoffs....   you keep telling yourself that  Senators....yeah they are awful right now but I can admit that and not expect them to win the cup 4 games into the season...  Beat Florida....  ...who can't???  Boston will decide cause they have your top picks....  
514552,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-10-25 00:53:00,0,  LOL Like I said. We will see come playoff time! And no one was planning the cup parade. We're in the process of rebuilding.  As far as Boston? We will see how that trade works out! So far Kessel's got 6 goals! He's gonna have more goals then the entire first line of the Senators.LOL
514555,muskymatt,2010-10-25 00:59:00,2608," Yeah Macarthur has 6 goals, Kessels has 6 goals and the rest of the team has 8 goals...good luck with that!  How many did Macarthur get the last 2 games??"
514558,lookinforwalleye,2010-10-25 01:08:00,4399," I would not take Florida lightly, but you can take the Sens lightly!!!  Sorry MM I couldn`t resist!"
514569,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-10-25 01:25:00,0," I didn't mention Macarthur but he is already doing way beyond what was expected of him. I expect Kaberle, Phaneuf, Armstrong, Kulimen, Vertseeg,  and Grabovski to pick up their scoring. We need to mix up the lines.  Only time will tell!"
514591,Roy,2010-10-25 02:16:00,13728,"I moved to Toronto in '61 and the Leafs took the cup in '62, '63 and '64...It would be a small price for the Leaf organization to buy me a house in Toronto today.  Just sayin'...."
514822,bassmaster4,2010-10-26 00:53:00,801,musky matt im getting sick and tired of your chirping if your going to chirp a team make sure your team is doing better before you go and run your mouth. Thank you
514847,muskymatt,2010-10-26 02:20:00,2608, Not gonna happen...sorry!  no matter how bad the sens are doing I'll still irk the forever irkfull laff fans...  40 years of sucking deservers razzing.....on any level...  
514900,jbailey,2010-10-26 11:48:00,866,this is getting personal haha
