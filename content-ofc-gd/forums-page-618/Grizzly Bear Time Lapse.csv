I'm still just trying to get all the photo work done with first before I work on doing the write up.  And one of the things I did with the photos, was make a time lapse.  I did the same thing a while back with photos from a Wide Mouth Mason and ZZ Top concert that I shot so I figured I'd do the same with bear photos....so here it is-6 days worth of photos in under 2 minutes...enjoy! oh..and watch in HD!
