514516,Kwan,2010-10-24 23:00:00,132,"Shore fishing from bewdley was on absolute fire two nights ago.  I've never seen so many fish come up from shore before, in such heavily fished areas.  Lots of walleye and catfish- incuding two which looked to be in the 3-4 pound range.  I nailed a walleye at scugog night fishing last week as well as this week, but i only have a pic of one of them.  We took a boat out from Bewdley and well, there doesnt seem to be much bass and we didnt get any luck with the walleye.  I want to explore more of Gore's and the otanabee come next spring!  Here's some pics from the last two outings   I lost my freakin crankbait i've ben getting them on at night... and its a no-name from China that is not sold here noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo   now I gotta buy a real one and cross my fingers fishing with it    I guess crappie still exists after being so heavily sought after by us shore fishermen.  note that live minnows no longer work for them at shore at night by the people i see fishig all the time.  it's almost like evolutionary- those that bite a minnow on a hook are all fished out haha. i got one on a 3/8 jig and 3 inch curly tail (what? i know) and my buddy got these on 2 inch gulps. on avg 8-10 people fish every night at the shore spots i go.  i want to find some more tranquil ones   enjoy"

514583,Kwan,2010-10-25 01:55:00,132,we got em in the middle of the night close from shore and took pics in the afternoon on the boat (yeah I know)

514944,fisherboy,2010-10-26 14:47:00,48,Nice job.  I have been fishing Rice Lake nonstop every week this season and seldom catch a crappie.  But then I don't night-fish and perhaps that's why.  Need to battle the cold some time before the season ends!
