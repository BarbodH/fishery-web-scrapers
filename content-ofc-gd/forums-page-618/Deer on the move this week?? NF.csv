514570,bucktail,2010-10-25 01:27:00,1857,Thinking of taking the week off and trying to get that buck that I posted. I have a feelin they may start moving once this full moon is gone. Any ideas guys??? Rattling and doe in heat scent?
514616,Bigworm,2010-10-25 11:41:00,119,Too warm yet! Maybe towards the end of the week when it cools down a bit. Haven't had a buck come in to the grunt tube or rattles yet this year and that is strange for me.  Mark
