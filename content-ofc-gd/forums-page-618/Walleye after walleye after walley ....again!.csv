Jig and Minnow was the bait, all the fish sitting in an 18' hole, nothing biting either side really, a bit better than the day before, a fish a cast still just bigger on average with a nice 21"" thrown back (eagle lake slot), had a great supper on Thursday, now i get to treat my work colleugues to lunch today too.  EAGLE LAKE PT.II    BEAUTIFUL COLOR ON THESE FISH      SUNSET TO THE WEST AND MOONRISE TO THE EAST AS I PACKED UP TO LEAVE     "

514235,Terry,2010-10-23 17:17:00,14456,Hi Maybe you can help me I am looking to buy a house in your area and a job in your area and a fishing partner in your area   I guess I had better tell my wife first.......  ok never mind  good report
514242,SlowPoke,2010-10-23 17:40:00,2984," What type of job will YOUR WIFE be looking for while you're out fishing? hehehe Simon, you're living the dream of many 'round. Enjoy it (but not sooo much!)"
514249,tb4me,2010-10-23 18:25:00,3295,Awesome as always Simon..Hey how do you hook your minnows? Whenever I use minnows n jigs like that they come off or I kill them putting them on. I dont know if im doing somthing wrong or if its the weight of the jig head. Thats some fine lookin red line too!! Thanks again
514266,Joey,2010-10-23 20:30:00,9122,"Sooooo unfair Simon  As usual, great video and report.  Joey"
514270,limeyangler,2010-10-23 20:50:00,5204,"  There was a good thread about minnow hooking on here just last week i think, some really good tips for hooking. Personally when jigging I put the point of the hook through the mouth of the minnow then out the side through the gill plate, then twist the point upwards and hook through the back by the dorsal fin.  as for that red line, i thought i should replace the braid i'd had for a while on that reel, and decided to try Power Pro instead of fireline...wow....i'm sold...awesome line!"
514273,Leecher,2010-10-23 21:08:00,7832,"Holly bejesus Simon, you certainly got them golden beauties dialed in  Talk about fish being stacked up in an 18' hole   one after the other..... unreal dude    It looks like them pickerals are just like sardines  Loads of fun I bet.... keep up the great work   and thanks for sharing!!!  Jacques"

514492,GBW,2010-10-24 20:47:00,8460,"All I needed to see was ""Walleye after walleye after walley ....again!"" and that it was posted by you Simon to get my attention.  Now that I have your attention, I hate you.      I need to get out fishing...      I'll read this later as I just had to tell you, I wish I was there..."
