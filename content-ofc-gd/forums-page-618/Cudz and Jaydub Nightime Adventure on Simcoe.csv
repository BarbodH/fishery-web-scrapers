That is pretty warm for this time of year. I immediately pull over to the side of the road  and text Jaydub to see if he is up for some fishing after 8 pm. I went night fishing by myself last Monday nad although I marked loads of fish I managed to only catch 2 good size rock bass. Losts of fish chase but not many commit to the bite.  Quite odd. Anyway, we are on the water no more that 3 minutes and I have a good bite.  I manage to get it to the boat but it jumps and hits the boat and gets off.  It was a good smallie but I did not land it.  Fishing tonight was slow but with the weather being perfect it was still fun. Managed a couple rock bass, perch and some smallies.  Jaydub with a little smallie    Cudz with a nice  big smallie "
