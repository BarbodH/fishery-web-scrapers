514584,spinnerbaitking,2010-10-25 01:56:00,1622,"There was a school of fish swarming the surface so I threw a crank bait over a caught this, it put up a nice fight  Not sure how many we caught but it was non stop pretty much all day  20"" Smallie 5lbs 11 oz  Moe's nicest one of the day  Hope you enjoyed the pictures"
514586,Roy,2010-10-25 02:04:00,13728,"Can't tell from that pic, Richard. Did it have 4 spots or so behind the gill plate in the upper quarter of its body? If it did, it's a shad.  Some really nice fish there, congrats!"
514592,spinnerbaitking,2010-10-25 02:16:00,1622,"I didn't notice any spots but it was very slippery & quite hard to hold on too, here's a picture of it's mouth "
514595,rufus,2010-10-25 02:31:00,267,Mooneye perhaps?
514597,Roy,2010-10-25 02:33:00,13728,Not a mooneye.
514598,kickingfrog,2010-10-25 02:34:00,8333,The tail sure looks like a shad in that first photo.  So I guess you can put me down for a definite maybe.
514599,timmeh,2010-10-25 02:45:00,609,could well be a gizzard shad.  Did you notice if the back of the dorsal fin was particularly long?
514601,mercman,2010-10-25 02:46:00,7054,chad. looks veri much like this one http://www.tnfish.org/PhotoGalleryFish_TWRA/FishPhotoGallery_TWRA/pages/GizzardShadDouglasNegus_jpg.htm
514603,asdve23rveavwa,2010-10-25 03:11:00,2690,"Gizzard Shad, almost 100 % sure...did it smell like hell?  Juli caught one in the harbour at Kincardine a year and a half ago...thought it was a whitefish when she first had it on."
514613,Rich,2010-10-25 11:12:00,3927,Gizzard shad. Usually find a lot of them this time of year near warm water outflows.
514614,spinnerbaitking,2010-10-25 11:21:00,1622,Ya that picture looked like it & it did smell Thanx every one Richard 
514619,Musky or Specks,2010-10-25 11:45:00,2710,Yup looks like a gizzard shad. Use to catch a ton of them back in the day when you could fish right up in the outflow at the bruce nuke.
514620,bushart,2010-10-25 12:03:00,2628,Atlantic  Ya'll know you wanted to say it!!
514638,ehg,2010-10-25 13:41:00,2666,Gizzard Shad don't hit lures they are vegetarians or plankton feeders. Have accidently snagged a couple over the years at warm water outflows where there are tons.
514674,Jon,2010-10-25 16:52:00,209,100% sure it is a gizzard shad.  I've seen lots sampling fish in Lake Ontario around Toronto.  Jon
514681,spinnerbaitking,2010-10-25 17:26:00,1622," The one in the picture was hooked beside the mouth on a Strike King Red Eye shad white & the second one we caught was in the back fin, way to much slime & smell on them to keep trying for them, but it didn't smell as bad as the Gar we caught in the summer Thanx for the replies even the Atlantic one"
514728,asdve23rveavwa,2010-10-25 19:21:00,2690," The one that Juli caught last year, actually hit a Little Cleo...the hooks were right in it's mouth.  I have the photo at work, and, will post it tomorrow.  I was totally surprised."
514819,Rich,2010-10-26 00:30:00,3927,They will hit tiny bits of worm on a hook... that's about it. Anything hitting the bait would be mooneye or goldeye.
514830,ehg,2010-10-26 01:49:00,2666,Any gizzard shad caught are accidentally snagged. They are phyloplankton filter feeders exclusively. This is explained in this article. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_gizzard_shad
514841,asdve23rveavwa,2010-10-26 02:15:00,2690,"I'll post the pic tomorrow, guys...you tell me what it is."
