Please take a moment and help vote for a great project that , with you help, will help Bruyere take seniors fishing. Please share this with other anglers and let's give back to the community and to those that helped start our passion. Please vote and spread the word, Thank you Jamie  http://www.avivacommunityfund.org/ideas/acf7859"
