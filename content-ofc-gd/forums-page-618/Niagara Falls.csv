514130,Muskieman,2010-10-23 02:16:00,2472,"I was in Niagara Falls for a few days this week, and while visiting the falls , I noticed a school 50 or more fish (2x the size of a Seagull) in a small pool near the foot of the falls, I assume that they were a Salmon of somekind...  Can someone educate me please?  Thanks  Randy "
514158,Musky or Specks,2010-10-23 03:31:00,2710,This time of year probably lakers.
514216,Rod Caster,2010-10-23 15:34:00,5784, 2x the size of a seagull = 10x the size of a squirell= 2 gallons of beer= 4x the size of a goats brain. Is my math correct?
514225,TerryC,2010-10-23 16:32:00,196,"Either Lakers or Steelhead, where exactly is this little pool you speak of? lol  Clarence"
514228,Muskieman,2010-10-23 16:58:00,2472," If you can manage to get down there, please tell us what you caught.  Right here.    Randy "
514231,TerryC,2010-10-23 17:05:00,196,I'll bet the maid of the mist could get within casting Range. Probably would be a tough hike down.  Clarence
514237,kickingfrog,2010-10-23 17:23:00,8333, Even tougher getting there from upstream.
514498,Billy Bob,2010-10-24 21:31:00,5865,They are Southern Ontario Sewer Trout.....  Go to McDee's to see how they taste...
514561,bucktail,2010-10-25 01:13:00,1857,"I once saw a massive fish 5 foot plus roll there in that exact spot, sturgeaon I assume."
514563,Nipfisher,2010-10-25 01:16:00,2449, Funny stuff RC.
514618,bigfish1965,2010-10-25 11:45:00,3382,Carp. Lots of them down there.
514623,Carp,2010-10-25 12:48:00,1488,"Lakers, bows, browns, salmon, carp............ Take your pick ! They're all in there and many other species too. My guess is salmon at this time of year."
514639,canadadude,2010-10-25 13:44:00,769,"my guess salmon, great fish'in hole there if you don't get tossed out.A few locals have access but it's not like years ago when it was no problem fishing there"
514644,Muskieman,2010-10-25 14:23:00,2472," How did they get down there? On foot? Or by boat?  Say that it were by boat, could you get tossed out ,if so why?  Randy "
514677,Spiel,2010-10-25 17:13:00,9065,"  On foot Randy, I assure you there is no way to get there by boat.   "
514680,Muskieman,2010-10-25 17:22:00,2472,  On foot ?... unreal!!  You'd almost have to be a skilled 1/2 Billygoat mountaineer/angler to get down there.  What prevents you from getting ther by boat?  Randy 
514682,Muskieman,2010-10-25 17:27:00,2472,Oh!    :stretcher:  I just checked out the satellite images on Google Maps... I now see why you can't there by boat...you can't seen to go anywhere upstream from the Whirlpool.  Randy 
514683,SRT8 smoker craft,2010-10-25 17:28:00,1107,The whirlpool keeps you from getting there by boat or actually the 10' wall of water at the top of the whirlpool rapid. Italo does a show right there every couple of years I think with permision you can go down the maid of the mist parking and access the river that way .
514684,Spiel,2010-10-25 17:30:00,9065," It's not even safe to go to the whirlpool by boat unless you're on one of the tourist jet boats.  But up by the falls there is a set of stairs (somewhere) that'll take you down to the ""Maid of the Mist"" docks, from there I guess you Billy Goat it."
514809,bigfish1965,2010-10-26 00:05:00,3382,"There is a road down to the Maid of the Mist...fished there many times..awesome spot. The road splits and goes down to the old hydro station there where you saw the fish, Randy. Since 9/11 you gotta be chummy with security to get down there. It is worth whatever bribe that gets you in, though."
514817,Aaron Shirley,2010-10-26 00:27:00,655,Some people have tried to get to that fishing spot by boat and jetskis over the years without much luck. Some even got creative and tried their luck in barrels
514828,BillM,2010-10-26 01:34:00,17367,Some wicked smallmouth down around the Maid of the Mist docks...
514930,canadadude,2010-10-26 14:00:00,769,Best Steelhead hole on the entire river IMO.
