I decided to replace it with a Burl Cork handle that I glued together. I then opened up the 1/4"" hole to 9/16 to get it set on a mandrel for turning. After hooking it up to a lathe I sanded it down to the size (1.35 inches tapered to .80 at the butt). The butt of the rod is finished with a Walnut butt cap that my Pops and I made to complete the job.  The rods beginnings    The thread work Chris made for me    The handle I turned    The Walnut butt cap     Art"

515159,misfish,2010-10-27 10:25:00,29133,  Only married a couple of months and your looking at other guys butts.  Nice job Art.
515164,aplumma,2010-10-27 11:39:00,6896,Chris thanks for the praise it means a lot to me I was not sure I could do justice to the quality of the rod it was installed on.  GBW you win you can have the title of the nicest butt in Canada but you got to get a female to vote for you to qualify.  I however will retain the title of the nicest International butt. Thanks Joey  Art
