Hook tangles will be handled by styrofoam plugs ove exposed hooks. The idea is to have the baits rotate on the hooks as the lid opens and closes. Any feedback is welcome. I am trying to improve the idea, if you like feel free to copy it for personal use.  Front veiw     Top view  "

One problem with yours is the fact that when you go to close it they will sometime get caught on the lids and get broken hooks, lips, etc. Also the holes are to big, they will bounce out and get snagged everywhere, and I mean everywhere.   They can cause a freekin grenade of a mess sometimes. Make th holes smaller. get yourself a peice of an old  tire tube that you are able to stretch across the entire section of the baits. Snapping in at both ends. This seems to work the best."
