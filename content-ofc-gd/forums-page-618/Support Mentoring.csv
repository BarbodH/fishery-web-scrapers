There are always 30 or more children waiting to be matched with an adult role model.  One of the largest barriers is funding.  The organization is embarking on trying to secure some funding through The Aviva Community Fund contest to help recruit more volunteers for mentoring programs. They would appreciate the help of OFC Members.  All you have to do is follow this link and register so you can vote for our recruitment idea.  There are no strings attached, so please help us in our quest to assist children with reaching their full potential. http://www.avivacommunityfund.org/ideas/acf5552  Thanks, Jimmer"
