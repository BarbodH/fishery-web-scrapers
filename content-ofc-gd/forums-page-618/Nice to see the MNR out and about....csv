To my surprise and Averie's excitement we were checked by an MNR officer.  He's new to the area and was out and about learning the tribs and trying to catch illegal steelheaders!    Luke was clapping and cheering on his big sister lol   They caught some fish...   Luke didn't want to hold his fish up for a picture haha   But Averie was very excited to have her picture taken with our local CO   And after a couple more of these...   We were on our way!   Enjoy your weeks!  Ryan & the kids!"

515035,splashhopper,2010-10-26 20:35:00,2931," I was thinking the same thing Dutchy.  Isn't he the guy that looked at YOU when you told him what you are educated in  It was ALL YOUR FAULT too !  But hey, that particular CO was a very reasonable individual and earned both of our respect that day."
