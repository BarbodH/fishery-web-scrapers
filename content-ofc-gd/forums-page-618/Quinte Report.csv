We trolled as far as the Cave, then we heard 1 walleye was caught near the plant so we trolled all over the triangle for the next 2 days. The 1 Walleye my buddy caught was just as we went by the ferry. Talked to a few guys and the fishin wasn't good. I hope our next trip in Nov. will produce  . Still had a great time, lots of laughs"
