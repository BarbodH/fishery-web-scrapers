1067872,georginaisle,2020-11-27 00:47:00,42,I just booked 4 days on temagamiÂ  with loon lodge I've never ever fished temagamiÂ  and was hoping those with experience could chime in with some tips. I especially want to fish ling and Walleye at night 
1067892,LeXXington,2020-11-27 21:15:00,1928,Extra tie down hooks for your ice hut little windy at times...Â  Good auger as the maps are never correct on depth location. Never caught a ling there and walleye is always a surprise
1067900,irishfield,2020-11-27 22:48:00,26272,"The new owners of Loon will take great care of you! BUT, I can't stress it enough to you, other than the packed trail to Loon's huts.. DO NOT even think about travelling on the lake at night.  Blue coloured firefox spoon seems to be a treat for Pickeral.."
1067913,smitty55,2020-11-28 04:04:00,928,"I take it you've met Adam, and his family. He did a bang up job on White Lake for the dozen years he was there after his dad bought Cedar Cove resort and creating Adams Outfitters and building it up bigger and better each year. Last three years he ran a derby for charity. His new bungalows I believe were relocated to Loon lodge a week ago. Not sure what the previous owners had for shacks. https://www.facebook.com/adamsoutfitting/ When you speak of not going off the roads at night is it because of sketchy ice in some areas or is it more related to pressure cracks and ridges? Cheers"
1067920,irishfield,2020-11-28 18:13:00,26272,"More related to huge slush fields that for the past 10 years or so have been a yearly thing. Bad enough at 8AM in -32C. I'm fairly certain it would be a death sentence at night... That, and even if on the packed trail, and snow falling and a strongÂ wind and it gets really easy to miss a trail marker and get turned around. Has even happened to us and can get a little dicy trying to find the shoreline to follow it, hopefully, home. I CAN NOT stress enough how important it is to carry a compass!    "
1067921,irishfield,2020-11-28 18:17:00,26272,"BTW.. Lexxington is having a heart attack just looking at the pictures! Georginaisle, email Adam and ask him what baits you should have for Ling. Not something we target in our group. We're after submarine Lakers for the most part..."
1067923,georginaisle,2020-11-28 20:57:00,42,"Thank u for the replies fellas! I wouldn't even think about travelling at night on an unknown body of water,bad idea for sure! I might do a day in a day but,but either than that I'll be sticking to the bungalow. I'll email Adam and quiz him on tactics"
1067925,LeXXington,2020-11-28 23:05:00,1928,now you tell me ðŸ¤ª
1067926,georginaisle,2020-11-28 23:08:00,42,Who makes the Firefox spoon?
1067932,irishfield,2020-11-29 02:43:00,26272,"FIrefox.... don't know for sure, pretty sure it's a trade name on the package. BLue/silver or Green / Silver. Swedish pimples work as well.."
1067935,mitch seguin,2020-11-29 13:30:00,98,He may be referring to Bluefox spoons
1067937,georginaisle,2020-11-29 16:54:00,42,"I can't find any Firefox spoons on Google,so I assume he meant blue fox too"
1067942,lew,2020-11-29 21:48:00,12766,Maybe these https://www.joom.com/en/products/1513661721485276404-63-1-26193-3810769836
1067945,irishfield,2020-11-29 22:40:00,26272,"Yah that's close Lew, guess I'll have to dig out my icefishing box and see if I can get some pictures. They're not Bluefox, although I'm sure similar shape and colour would work as well."
1067946,misfish,2020-11-29 22:53:00,29133,"Since you,ll be out looking,look for those udder lures. LOL"
1070624,georginaisle,2021-02-17 23:44:00,42,5 days...getting pumped!
1070628,AKRISONER,2021-02-18 03:11:00,5558,For burbot dead stick a minnow on bottom deep edges was marking a bunch in 45fow on the weekend. They havenâ€™t quite moved up to spawn yet.
1070693,akaShag,2021-02-21 01:59:00,2073,Agreed.
1070695,georginaisle,2021-02-21 02:28:00,42,Deep edges?
1070696,AKRISONER,2021-02-21 03:17:00,5558,I was marking a bunch in 48 fow on a ledge that goes from 17 to 85 fow
1070698,georginaisle,2021-02-21 04:07:00,42,"Oh,ok.thanks for clarifying"
1070699,georginaisle,2021-02-21 04:08:00,42,I thought ling were bottom feeders?
1070700,georginaisle,2021-02-21 04:11:00,42,A question a little off topic but are there zebra mussels in Lake temagami
1070701,akaShag,2021-02-21 13:20:00,2073,yes.
1070723,irishfield,2021-02-22 00:16:00,26272,NO and lets keep it that way! Spiny water flea.. Yes.
