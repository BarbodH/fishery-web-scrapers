1071151,misfish,2021-03-11 19:09:00,29133,"This is something I wanted try since a buddy posted on another board. It is the stomach and esophagus from a white fish. I was told it is like calamari. So today I gave it a go. I will say,I am a fan. Cleaned and rinsed and soaked in salt water for a few hours. Dry with paper towel,trim and fry. DANG, that is some good stuff.       Like the saying,what wont kill ya,will make a stronger."

1071180,Terry,2021-03-12 14:17:00,14456,I donâ€™t think it would be illegal you can gift fish to anyone you want and he can gift back so not illegal
1071181,mamona,2021-03-12 15:02:00,597,This thread started really nice. Somehow it is evolving towards horror story.
