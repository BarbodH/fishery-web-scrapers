1070826,Hack_Fisherman,2021-02-28 18:44:00,720,I’m starting to gather info on building my own lures. I’ve watched a bunch of great videos. Looks like a great way to be involved in the hobby in the off season. any of you guys build your own? I’d be interested on good sources for supplies and quality wire forming equipment that won’t break or break the bank. I want to make everything from small spinners to large Muskie lures and Salmon/Laker spoons. Lyman style copies too. some of the wire formers look like they don’t work all that well. I’d like to be as pro as possible.
