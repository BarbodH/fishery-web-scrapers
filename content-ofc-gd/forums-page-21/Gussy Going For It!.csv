1070796,AKRISONER,2021-02-27 14:09:00,5558,"For those of you interested, Jeff Gussy Gustafson of lake of the woods is leading the bassmaster elite in Knoxville Tennessee on day 3 of 4. he’s already got a limit on day three fishing winter pattern smallmouth in the Deep South! Really awesome stuff. Only one other canadian has ever won one of these events. To win an event in the south for a canadian makes it even cooler. Gussy even said during his weigh in interview after day 2 that he has been waiting for years for the right conditions and lake for an opportunity to fish the way he is, which is the same way he’s dialed in on them early spring on his home lake. you can watch the coverage live all day here  https://m.bassmaster.com/video/bassmaster-live"
1070797,SmokestackLightnin,2021-02-27 15:30:00,390,"Watching a bit of it on Bassmaster LIVE.  He is one of the only anglers fishing vertically, looks like he's targetting smallies.  https://www.bassmaster.com/video/bassmaster-live "
1070799,BillM,2021-02-27 15:51:00,17367,It would be nice if they actually showed some footage from the leader instead of guys catching nothing tossing crankbaits
1070800,Whopper,2021-02-27 17:10:00,2174,I have a real problem with him being able to come down here and fish when I can't come to his country to fish. Anywho good for him
1070801,AKRISONER,2021-02-27 17:17:00,5558,Big difference...it’s his job. He’s not pleasure fishing. They travel and quarantine and then have stayed down there fishing the elites for a month now.  travel Isn’t restricted for business purposes
1070803,Whopper,2021-02-27 17:58:00,2174,"His profession is a moot point. You and him have options that aren't afforded to me. You or your fellow Canadian could get on a plane fly down and pleasure fish for a month if  wanted too and turn around and go home, quarantine for 14 days and he's good to go. Meanwhile you have outfitters in NWO and else where that will be lucky to survive with no tourism in sight."
1070804,BillM,2021-02-27 18:47:00,17367, I guess that's something you'll need to bring up to your local member of government?
1070805,Terry,2021-02-27 19:40:00,14456,Same can be said both ways with hockey players football baseball  basketball each were allowed in each country
1070810,OhioFisherman,2021-02-27 21:43:00,6623,It will be interesting to see if that smallmouth pattern holds up?
1070814,AKRISONER,2021-02-28 02:00:00,5558,A local posted on bass boat central that there’s always fish there. They are clearly wintering there and stacked up. You gotta hope that something catastrophic doesn’t happen to make the fish disappear on him on championship Sunday. a 7lb lead helps a lot that’s for sure
1070816,fishdawg,2021-02-28 02:44:00,912,Anyone with a good link for FS1 coverage?
1070817,AKRISONER,2021-02-28 02:58:00,5558,"Agreed, the “live coverage” isn’t as good as “bass live” with the entire crew."

1070835,OhioFisherman,2021-02-28 21:51:00,6623,Congrats! nice to see it held up for him. 
1070837,BillM,2021-02-28 22:28:00,17367,Talk about a dominating win.   Nice job.   surprised no one else was fishing that pattern.
1070841,AKRISONER,2021-03-01 00:29:00,5558,Zaldain tried on day 1 he was actually at the spot before gussy and zeroed  they said to win that tournament exclusively with smallmouth was impossible
1071032,woodenboater,2021-03-08 00:46:00,2277,"The Globe and Mail is not the place you'd expect to find stories on bass fishing but there ya go. Marty Klinkenberg writes about Gustafson's win. https://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/article-jeff-gustafon-reels-in-100000-catch-down-south/?utm_medium=Referrer:+Social+Network+/+Media&utm_campaign=Shared+Web+Article+Links  I think Klinkenberg also wrote something about urban fishing around Toronto, last year.  A few years back the Globe's Cathal Kelly wrote a side splitting piece while riding shotgun with Ike Iaconelli. will post the link to that laffer after I search for it. fwiw, I  met Cathal and he is so far from who one would expect to cover the Bassmaster, bespoke trench coat, tailored suit, nice leather shoes..."
