1049181,Rizzo,2019-09-01 13:01:00,4754,"Glad to hear SOME success stories coming out of this. Never been madder in my life than when I went through this process. Although we never got all our $ back from xwrp (only a portion), when the dealership changed hands we got some repairs done for free...repairs we DELIBERATELY had not done because we didn't want to void the warranty. Either way...keep at it all of you. For each of these success stories I bet there are many who just lay down, give up, and let these people (xwrp/car dealers) scam them"
1066543,Heebs,2020-10-14 15:37:00,6,"I'm going through this exact same issue right now. XWRP has everything they need, and I got denied and won't get my money back as well. I've contacted OMVIC at this point and they told me to connect with the dealerships' manager and see if they can do something. If not, I will proceed with small claims court because I have every single e-mail, phone call and documentation since 2014 and will try my damn best to get my money back as I should've without having to fight for it1!!!"
1066553,Snidley,2020-10-14 21:07:00,620,"Good luck HEEBS. Depending on the judge Small claims can be a great option. I have used it successfully myself. This whole thing is a great example of how our government lets us all down at virtually every turn. OMVIC was set up to protect consumers from fraud at dealerships and related industries. You could not find a more blatant fraud than this particular transaction and their best effort is to send the consumer back to the fraudster. How outrageous.  On the other hand if the dealership does anything that would affect the government themselves, like holding inventory for more than a year and not remitting HST as an example, they would be all over it with fines etc. Lazy, useless and incompetent are just some of the adjectives that come to mind regards OMVIC. Thieving dicks would come to mind for Chrysler and their dealer network."
1066566,Heebs,2020-10-15 11:43:00,6,"I'm just so bummed out as well. I bought the extended warranty as an ""insurance"" also. I'm very mechanically inclined and can do any work on a vehicule, but with the first time ever buying a brand new vehicule, I didn't want to screw around on thousands of dollars worth of work if the motor or transmission went to hell. Therefore, the promise to get all my money back if I don't use it in the extended part was a no-brainer for me; So I thought!! Even 5 years in, my oil filter housing started leaking oil, and because I had only about 1 year to go to get my 4000$ back, I decided to take the top of my motor apart to get to the oil filter housing and spend my time and money to fix myself; It was easy, but I only did it because I had 4000$ coming my way shortly! If anything major would've happened in the next year...it is what it is at that point, and I wouldn't been out the 500$. I understood all my cards and how I was playing them. That's right! you read it right....I am getting soaked for 4000$!!!!! All paperwork was sent within the first 60 days. XWRP replies saying the dealership letter needs to come from the selling dealer. So I contact them, get it and send it out. Then they reply I need to provide maintenance records of at least 1 oil change per year!!! Now this pissed me off because when the warranty was sold to me, I made sure with the salesperson that I can do all my own oil changes and he assured that it's all good and it wouldn't make no difference!! Luckily I was able to prove at least 2 oil changes per year with all the paperwork recorded in my maintenance book. Then I got the denial letter comes in as I expected at this point because, to me, it was obvious they were just rolling down the script and trying to find the next possible thing I probably wasn't able to provide and claim that as a denial! This denial letter states I had passed the alloted kilometers throughout my contract, which was 120000km at the end of april. This is the interesting part; My last oil change was mi-may, which I jotted down the 126000km I had then.....BUT this does not prove in any way what I had kilometer wise at the end of april; Nor I or do they know at this point! So I'm getting denied on something that no one could prove at the time the denial letter was sent. If that was an item that was enough to deny a claim, wouldn't they want me to go get a dealership record on file with my kilometers on it...... Right now, I'm going to see where all this goes with the dealership, but having every single piece of paperwork, e-mail, phone conversation log and everything else in between since april 2014, and this ridiculous denial letter, I'm not far from going to small claims and see what happens. Everytime I went to the mailbox since april 2020, I was 100% sure I had a cheque waiting for me, but then I open the letters from XWRP and am completely chocked at the responses with a gut wrenching feeling every single time!!! All this to say, if anyone has any tips for me along my journey....feel free to contact me privately please, I would truly appreciate it!!! Cheers to you all and hopefully we can help others going forward to understand what they're in for if they sign that paperwork with the expectations that were promised to us!"

1066576,DanD,2020-10-15 13:57:00,2223,"I would start the court proceedings and have WXRP served with the court date. That'll let them know that you're not going away. They'll most likely (Not a 100% sure thing) approach you with a settlement offer. If they do it's usually a week or so before the court date. Again if they do offer a settlement, I would seriously consider it. Weigh-out all of your out of pocket expenses, time off work, court costs (if you do not get a judgment against them); add these expenses to their offer and see what you are really giving up be taking the settlement. Another thing to think about, even if you win a judgment; all that means is that the court agrees with you, that they owe you. Small claims does not/cannot force them to peel off a cheque. It's up to you to collect payment. If they still want to play games and not pay; it'll mean another court date for a detor's hearing/examination. If you do not win that battle; you'll likely never see your money. I been through both of the above scenarios and I'm still waiting for my money from a 20+ year old judgment. In the meantime get all your paperwork in order and wright out a script and practice how you're going to present your evidence. Make 2 copies of your evidence, one for the judge and one for WXRP's lawyer. Making sure the judge's copy matches yours; as in order of sequence; he'll be able to follow along easily, as you make your presentation. Screw WXRP and shuffle the pages. LOL Dan "
1066580,Snidley,2020-10-15 14:34:00,620,"Dan is right on all counts. In court what's in writing is paramount. Clear delineation of your case is also important. An expert witness is also a huge benefit. Knowing beforehand if the adversary is ""collectable"" is your first move. This is an old story, be sure XWRP is still a viable operating business before you proceed."
1066582,Dutch01,2020-10-15 15:23:00,1431,"Dodge is obviously aware of these issues and still pushes this scam through their dealer network.  Time to vote with your wallet and never buy another of their products.  You might love your RAM truck, but you are supporting scammers.  You'll love your Chevy or Ford too after you adjust to the difference."
1066592,Snidley,2020-10-15 16:23:00,620,"Most people in the car industry, especially the used car industry, know that Chrysler or FCA make crappy vehicles and the management use trickery to flog their junk. They are not the only ones, but probably they are the worst in North America. It's been that way for a long time and it's almost like a long term training program within the network of building and selling Crycos that you will build crap, you will employ cheezy sales and marketing tricks and in the end, the public will get burned. With that said Toyota, a fantastic manufacturer, had a very similar issue with International Warranty back in the 90's. Huge swaths of consumers got burned in International's bankruptcy and Toyota and other makers, let the consumer twist in the wind. Bottom line, if it sounds too good to be true it is to good to be true and not just in the car industry. What's most disappointing in all of this to me however, is the response of OMVIC. It's just another reminder that the government in Ontario, Canada, Toronto, St Catherines, etc are basically populated by, run by, dicks. They will screw the public virtually all of the time. Sometimes it's well hidden, sometimes its as obvious as can be. This case is transparently obvious to anyone but the losers at OMVIC, a department of the Ontario government."

1066615,DanD,2020-10-16 15:25:00,2223,All automotive (or any other) large manufacturer and their policies have faults.  	We as the consumer have to make informed purchases. If you get burned in a purchase (sorry but) it’s your fault. It’s not like 50 years ago where you could take a person by their word. Because they likely had a hand in building that product. Most salespeople today work on piece sales. They’ll tell you anything you need to hear to make a sale. Knowing that they’ll never have to back up that sales promise. A complaint moves up the chain of command.  	But we also have the internet; to use as a benefit. Research the crap out of what you’re interested in and who you might buy it from. That’s what I meant if you get burnt on a purchase is your fault.  	Dan.
1066618,Snidley,2020-10-16 18:14:00,620,"Dan I agree you have to protect yourself and this has always been so. Consumer fraud was actually far worse in the past artisanal workforce not withstanding . Stock fraud, product fraud, food fraud, medical fraud was outrageously prevalent in the past. Truthfully consumers of the past were remarkably gullible, much more so than today. It is also true that we  have far better resources, but not perfect resources these days than in the past. Perhaps someone who has gone through the process at a dealership can explain to me their thought process when the pitch was that you get a warranty and at the end of the day you can also get ALL of your premium  back. To me this has obvious flaws as a presentation, especially at a car dealership. A Chrysler dealership at that. Can you guys that have been through it tell me what the salesperson actually said in response to the obvious question I'm assuming someone asked, which is how is this offer even possible."
1066705,spooner_jr,2020-10-21 03:56:00,193,"Just started going through this myself.  Bought a Ram in August 2015, didn't want the warranty as I told the salesman I'd put 100km on it in three years.  He told me I should still buy it.  I asked if I could get the refund when I hit 100km, he said no, you have to wait the full 5 years.  Sent in all the required paperwork and with 160km on it, I was denied the refund as the warranty expired before the end of the term.  Called the salesman when I got the letter and he says he didn't sell it to me, that I bought it and should have done my due diligence. "
1066706,Snidley,2020-10-21 04:12:00,620,I'm guessing they are not working hard on customer loyalty. I know a Ford dealer in a small town and he tells me that you have to be very careful about how you treat people in town. I guess he's wrong.     
1066716,Heebs,2020-10-21 12:55:00,6,"Hey Snidley, Here's a e-mail conversation I had with my salesperson 2 years after I bought the van. I was still led into getting al my money back. He also lied to me and said the warranty was through Chrysler Canada. Me: ""Ok, then one of my questions is: Is my extended warranty through Chrysler Canada or through a thrid party company? I want to read all the fine prints about the promise I got from you for getting all your money back if there's no warranty work between the standard and extended warranty. I'm hearing more stories of people not getting their money back and I'm not a fan of this possible situation."" Salesperson: The warranty is indeed through Chrysler Canada.  The only case that you wouldn’t get the money back would be if you used the warranty during the 4th or 5th year.  Just be sure to come and see me before the warranty is up and I can make sure that you qualify for it. Me: So quick recap. Here is the Basic warranties below, and my extended warranties everything for 6 years? SO, bumps up basic by 3 years, and powertrain by 1 year.    I may use the warranty as needed until may 1st 2017 / 60000 km for all my basic stuff, and until May 1st 2019 / 100000km for powertrain And this will not affect anything on the refund part. If for any reason what so ever I use the warranty between May 1st 2017 and May 1st 2020 for basic, or between May 1st 2019 May 1st 2020, That will void any refunds what so ever?  Make sense?  Sorry, just need to confirm because it would be very misleading if I don't use the warranty throughout these years and don't get my money back. Salesperson: That is correct.  As long you as you don’t use the warranty during the “Extended” portion.  Keep in mind, something as simple as a light bulb or a loaner/rental vehicle could case you to lose the money back portion.  But like I said, please make sure to come and see me right before the warranty is due.  I can help make sure everything is done correctly.   I made sure at my damn best to make sure I did everything right to get my money back....... And they still deny it, but based on assumptions! I'm stumped."
1066733,Snidley,2020-10-21 18:04:00,620,"When you go to court be sure to take a certified copy of this email conversation. The salesman clearly was lying. By the way did you ever ""go and see him"" prior to claiming your refund ?I would also make the general manager of the Chrysler dealership aware of this email, since his salesmen are using a fraudulent lie to sell the product. In the end I don't know why OMVIC doesn't get involved especially with the clear fraud of claiming this is a Chrysler product and not a third party product. This is a huge legal issue to be sure."
1066734,Heebs,2020-10-21 18:06:00,6,Appreciate the feedback. What's a certified copy and how to attain that? I'm calling OMVIC again shortly.

1066760,Snidley,2020-10-22 02:21:00,620,"I  talked to a dealer friend of mine and let him know about this scam and he said that a friend of his with a Chrysler product has this warranty. H e was not aware of the issues but we both agreed that it probably would be best to use the warranty and forget about the refund for his friend. My dealer friend says that most problems with warranty's are that they pro rate what they are prepared to pay for repairs so that frequently there are out of pocket expenses even when the warranty does pay something for a repair. Another issue is the transfer of the warranty to a purchaser when the warranty is still technically in effect There are frequently registrations required and registrations usually require registration fees as well as penalties for failure to register, like the warranty is void if not registered. My friend ended up on the losing end of a warranty because there was an exclusion in the warranty transfer wording that excluded transfer to a car dealer from the private seller. It was a problem since the car in question was a Jaguar, a car that usually needs warranty work, expensive warranty work. At the end of the day my friend uses a company called Global and he says he has not experienced problems with them. He often puts a Gobal warranty on his high dollar Euro cars in his lot inventory just in case there are expensive issues. Lubrico was another warranty company that he felt was legit., a word I would not use for WXRP or for that matter, Chrysler/FCA."

1044287,iceguy24,2019-05-10 21:15:00,1,I bought this extended warranty when I purchased my vehicle thinking it was a no-risk option - I'm covered if something major happens but I can get my money back if I don't use it.  I paid for small repairs that would have been covered personally just to keep the warranty refund option intact.  I never put through any claims.  I just tried applying for a refund only to find out that I missed the 60-day window after the warranty period ends to make the request (this is day 93).  I'm furious!  What bothers me even more is that I exceeded the mileage allowance for the warranty about a year and a half ago and tried to ask for a refund then since I was no longer under their coverage - but they told me I had to wait until the warranty term lapsed!  I'm really angry!  I won't consider an extended warranty like this again!

First, please bear with my english (english is not my mother tongue).  I had the same problem last May 2019. They (Xwrp London) insisting that my warranty refund claim is voided because i exceeded on the kilometers before it reach the expiration date of the warranty refund contract. So i asked them to find and read the clause on the contract that states that my warranty refund claim will be voided because i excedeed the mileage. They cant answer my question but they arrogantly insisting that may refund claim is voided and the decision is final. After a couple of weeks of telephone arguments with Xwrp London office. What i did is, i talk to the dealership manager where i bought my car and the XWRp contract. I told them my situation, and ask them to back me up against Xwrp London to get my refund. At first they refused to help me. There reason is that i should go after Xwrp London not them. So i informed them that i will file a claim against them (Dealership) and Xwrp London. And then Tadddaaaa!!!! The Managers tone of voice changed rapidly. They agreed to pay me the amount that i paid for the Xwrp contract. Good luck to all."

1039837,Snidley,2019-01-29 17:56:00,620,"Virtually all new car dealerships have an F&I administrator and they all offer after purchase packages because there's way more profit in the finance, warranty, rustproofing etc than profit in the sale of the car itself. Yes the dealer principal can make loads of money from bonus programs and incentives from the OEM's but they never seem to count that revenue when looking at day to day operation of the business. Kickbacks from financial institutions, huge markups from warranties and  chemical aftermarket add ons like rustproofing, fabric protection make for a very lucrative day to day opportunity for dealers. These business factors drive the consolidation of OEM brands under dealer groups. This is what pundits are talking about when they discuss consolidating multiple brands under one back store at a dealer group. The problem, as always, when business ""improves"" operational efficiancy is that the consumer gets screwed virtually 100% of the time. This is what has happened here, the dealership made money (probably 50%) the warranty scheme made money (the other 50%) and the consumer got screwed (lost 100%)."
1040442,Mbshizzie,2019-02-14 15:20:00,3,I went through this last summer/fall...my advice would be to see a paralegal or file a claim in small claims court.
1040455,iionly,2019-02-14 16:46:00,9,Mbshizzie how did you deliver the claim to the company? Did you bring it there personally?
1040456,Squid,2019-02-14 17:04:00,1656,"I told my salesman , when I bought my 2016 sierra, (3rd truck with him) that if the finance guy tries to sell me anything besides completing the sale, I will walk out the door without buying a truck there. Sure enough my salesman told the finance guy and when I sat with him he teased me about taking extended warranty and quickly said he was just teasing....Be upfront about it. Let them know that if they attempt to sell more stuff, electric rust proofing lol or extended anything is when you get up and walk out if they do not listen to you the customer."
1040473,Rizzo,2019-02-14 22:49:00,4754,definitely doing that next time!
1041045,unamused,2019-03-02 20:45:00,7,"Hi everyone, I have been through a similar experience with XWRP extended warranty scam. I got mine through Mazda when I got my CX5 in 2013. I had never purchased an extended warranty until that day. I was told that I would get a full refund if I didn't use it. I thought what the heck, for the sake of losing out on a wee bit of interest, why not? This February, I went to the dealership to begin the refund process and asked them if they had a copy of the contract (at that time I couldn't find mine...but found it later). They said they didn't keep copies after 2 years. I thought what the hell, how can you not keep contracts that last 6 years for, I don't know, 6+ years. Anyways, luckily I found mine, but this foreshadowed more trouble coming. I did get the letter from the dealership stating that I did not use the extended warranty. They uttered not a peep about going over alotted km. I faxed the pages as required to XWRP. I called them to confirm they got them. They did. I asked if there was anything else required. They said no. Then a week later I got a letter asking for the maintenance reports. I was getting ticked by now. I managed to get the report and fax that off. A week later I received notice that I did not qualify for a refund as the contract must expire ""by time only.""  I had driven over 300k in the 6 years. If I had known that going over 120k would be an issue, I never would have purchased the extended warranty.  I have gone back to the dealer and tried to get their help. As you would expect, they were friendly, perhaps mildly sympathetic, but could not help.  I have started a complaint at BBB and emailed The Star's ""The Fixer."" Next step is to get after XWRP and after that start a small claims file. "
1041051,tomkat,2019-03-03 00:58:00,246,Doesn’t say anything about mileage under terms and conditions? So many scams these days. Seems odd that manufacturers would allow this to tarnish the brand and the dealerships.
1041052,unamused,2019-03-03 01:12:00,7,"Hi Tomkat, no it is not spelled out there, for sure. ""expire by time only"" is about as vague as you can get. Apparently, Mazda is now offering an extended warranty with a different company. I asked to see the contract and it is spelled out in clear terms that going over the allowable km will cancel the contract. Additionally, if you do qualify for a refund, you'll get less than 70% back. I'm going to go out on a limb here and say it's probably due to the blowback they have gotten. "
1041076,Rizzo,2019-03-03 23:00:00,4754,"if you look at the first one you hi-lited it says it must expire ""by time only""...they got you. Its usually a 5 year 100,000km warranty or something like that. Your warranty expired at the 100 k mark...but you weren't allowed to apply for your refund until the 60 month mark...and your warranty was long over by then. This is the fine print that is NEVER mentionned by the salesperson. How people sell this crap knowing you will get screwed in the end is the part that really gets me. This is why I had MORE of a beef with my dealership than I did with XWRP. At the end of the day both are clearly dishonest"
1041084,unamused,2019-03-04 01:04:00,7,"There is nothing on the page about the 100k km limit though. I agree with you, they are both dishonest scammers."
1041122,Old Ironmaker,2019-03-04 22:54:00,8243,"Someone mentioned there is more profit in the ""add ons"" that a sales guy will try and convince you is a must. They make even more $$$ doing dealer service. I had the brakes lock up on my Silverado out of the blue air a last summer. Their price for the fronts was no less than $2500.00. I had it done by my guy that is recognized by GM for warranty work if any for around 1500 bucks. Still ridiculous but it's 2019 not 1989. I would have done them myself with help back then. When we bought the new truck in 011' the manager gave me the pitch. When he got to the undercoat (scam to me) I got up and said I better cancel the sale. ""You just told me that brand new truck is going to rust within 7 years, I don't want to buy a rust bucket!"" I thought he was going to stroke out. They offer these deals on used cars as well."
1041123,lew,2019-03-04 23:47:00,12766,"I bought a new  F150 Lariat pick-up this past spring and it was about the best buying experience I ever had with a new vehicle. They gave me the price, I countered and we went back & forth a couple times and the deal was done and we were both happy. Never once was I pressured to buy a single extra including extended warranty and the only extras I did get were the ones I asked for and I had them included in the price. Very pleasant buying experience and nothing like the horror stories related in this thread and if anyone else is looking for a similar deal go have a talk with Country Ford in Bobcaygeon. "
1041126,chris.brock,2019-03-05 02:05:00,4053,"I still wish you guys would take these snakes to court and swing for the fences. If you've got your stuff together, there's no way a judge could screw up on this one."
1041128,unamused,2019-03-05 02:35:00,7,"I have written formal letters of complaint to both Mazda  and XWRP.  They have limited time to get back to me with a resolution. (full refund). If I don't hear back, the next step is a formal OMVIC complaint and small claims court."
1041129,chris.brock,2019-03-05 03:02:00,4053,"That's cool, I've said it before though, I wouldn't bother with letters, emails, complaints, and added stress, it would be straight to the court house and asking for $25k for the refund, plus stress and aggravation and loss of quality of life for the whole ordeal."
1041131,Old Ironmaker,2019-03-05 03:56:00,8243,"You have it served by a Sheriff, we still hived them 10 years ago."

I am positive the sales guy said to himself, ""Save my breath, this guy ain't drinkin' the Cool Aid."" I just watched an episode of Drive TV, Canuck show, and Ford offers no less than 950 different versions of the F-150. Please make up your mind Ford.  Please don't tell anyone but this Chevy driver actually likes the look of them now. I bought the Chevy because it was 10 grand less than the similar F-150 my neighbour paid. PS. I was just outside Burleigh Falls a few weeks ago picking up a vehicle a buddy bought. The area has changed for sure. Maybe you haven't noticed because you live there, big changes compared to the 80s. But what hasn't including Mullets? Lovesick Lake Camp looks so small today. I still have flash backs going down the rapids and going over the Falls at 2AM, no boat, just drunk. That was 2 trips to Emerg within 24 hrs. got hit by a cab outside the ""I Can't Remember Hotel "" and the white water rafting sans boat. The town Prince Philip went to College."

1039142,chris.brock,2019-01-12 05:18:00,4053,pm me if you're interested in using small claims court
1039143,Kverde,2019-01-12 05:42:00,7,"Couldn't agree with you more Rizzo! Having trouble sleeping, can't believe I fell for this scam.  Was trusting Dodge/Chrysler to steer me in the right direction. Thanks again for the support."
1039144,Kverde,2019-01-12 05:44:00,7,"Thanks Chris, I might just take you up on that offer.  I'll keep you posted."
1039171,Rizzo,2019-01-12 23:58:00,4754,"Ya I called Chris too when I was going through this. Fortunately I never had to go to court...I ended up getting 2000 out of the 2500 I was owed so left it at that...same as you...was losing A LOT of sleep. At the time I really needed that refund and had ""budgeted"" it. Was a disastrous experience to say the least"
1039178,Kverde,2019-01-13 02:18:00,7,"Same here Rizzo....Made some decisions based on this refund.  The transmission blew at 108,000km.  Decided to keep the van and have it repaired knowing we had $2500.00 coming our way.  At this time with four kids and a couple in university we are feeling this loss.  Plan is to take this one step at a time via email only because I’ll have a tough time keeping my cool over the phone plus want everything in writing.  If we don’t get the money I want to at least ruffle some feathers to prevent others falling for this scam.  I knew without a doubt I would hit the 100,000 mark in about 3.5-4 years, I should not have been sold this."
1039181,chris.brock,2019-01-13 03:44:00,4053,"emails and internet posts won't really ruffle any feathers, and not getting your money should not be an option, if you want to go the small claims route, I'll serve the papers and we'll go to court together, I just abhor Bull scams like this"
1039185,Rizzo,2019-01-13 13:43:00,4754,"I did emails, faxes, phonecalls...you name it. I was absolutely relentless....because I was very skeptical when I bought it...couldn't believe I fell for their scam. When the lady at Dodge sold it to me I actually told her ""If this doesn't work out...I will be your worst nightmare"".  I am a man of my word. They tricked me, got my money, I was not going away without being an immense pain in the butt.  After all, I did warn them I would be incredibly annoying if it didn't work out as they promised. And I was. All phone calls I made I took notes and recorded the day/time/who I spoke with. Right now I would say your bigger beef is with the dealership...they should never have sold it to to you."
1039186,Rizzo,2019-01-13 13:49:00,4754,"I even had one of those ""consumer protection"" tv groups tee'd up to go interview Dodge about why they were not helping me....then I got a good chunk of the $ back. I had been having chest pains from the stress/anxiety....just decided to let it go for the sake of my health. Also had a case set up with their governing body...let that go too. I guess that squeeky wheel expression worked in my case. But it never should have come to that."

I received a response from the dealership and they are calling Xwrp on Monday. Thanks to Rizzo and member iionly, the info they provided on this thread has lead me to the “denial reason”.  Which is very vague and indicates when the contract expires but does not state the refund will not be issued. This is what the contract states.... ”Warranty Refund” means a Warranty Refund program in which the underlying Warranty Contract must expire by time only.”  So it has expired by time, issue my refund! "
1039193,iionly,2019-01-13 17:19:00,9,Let me know how it all goes. I still havn't gone through small claims court for this as it was making me so angry I had to stop for a while. But there is a 2 year limitation period. I'm planning on going via this route soon. I will be using the letter given to me by the dealership that states mileage is not a reason to deny my refund and the slideshow that I posted as well. I intend to get 100% of my refund.
1039198,Rizzo,2019-01-13 18:54:00,4754,"Go get em! If anything good comes of this there have been 10,000 views to this post...hopefully that prevents others from being scammed...or it stops car salespeople with a conscience from selling this scammer policy"
1039210,chris.brock,2019-01-14 00:31:00,4053,"It's not just the money, it's the stress and headaches I can see Rizzo, iionly and Kverde have gone through that really ticks me off. iionly or Kverde, if you want a wingman, pm me, I'd enjoy helping out, like I said before I've been through the process, I had a dealership and Ford Credit screw me and then blame each other so I served them both and let the judge figure it out, and figure it out he did"
1039217,smitty55,2019-01-14 03:05:00,928,"I must say this has been a very interesting thread that I've enjoyed following. It really ticks me off too hearing about these corrupt dealerships and credit agencies that have to damn well know that they are screwing folks and for the most part can get away with it against the average Joe. Great on you guys for fighting back and recouping your coin. I strongly suggest taking Chris up on his offer, his ruling could even set a precedent for your own issues. Lastly, if it was me that had to go through this crap I would still be super ticked even if I got all my money back and I would want to get back at them for sure. Obviously for one citizen it's hard to go against big corp, but this sounds like the perfect issue for the investigative news media to latch on to, like Market Place or The Fifth Estate. Can you imagine the potential class action lawsuits. I can't imagine a better revenge ? Good luck guys. Cheers"
1039228,ch312,2019-01-14 15:32:00,1590,"Devils advocate time... Is it really a scam when the customer chooses to sign papers without reading and fully understanding what they're signing? You admitted to not reading and understanding the contract you signed, something that is quite common when people are excited about buying a new vehicle and is likely something dealerships count on. I wouldn't call this a scam, I would call it taking advantage of people who don't exercise due diligence.   It boggles my mind how many people are so eager to put their signature on legally binding paperwork without understanding what they're signing. According to an old highschool buddy at the dealership we bought an SUV from last year....""Most people don't even bother reading the contract, they just want to sign and drive away.""   "
1039230,iionly,2019-01-14 15:43:00,9,"I read the paperwork completely. The wording  does not say that it would be invalid if you go over100k. Furthermore, the signed letter that I have by the dealership and the slideshow also contradict what the xwrp company is saying. xwrp is scamming people 100%. The original company went bankrupt and this new one is trying to save money by defrauding people. You are not being devils advocate if you are uninformed yourself."
1039237,Rizzo,2019-01-14 18:53:00,4754,"I also read it completely. There was no reason for them not to give me my money back, that is why they eventually gave me 2000, after a MASSIVE fight.  So now I am out $500. Am I gonna take them to court over 500? No...too much trouble. That my friend is an absolute scam. Try to steal my 2500, but if you know I am gonna put up a fight, just give 2000 back to shut me up and make it so I won't go to court. The clause they referred to in my ""denial"" letter didn't even exist! Over and over I asked them to send me proof of this clause in my contract...nobody ever did. In my case it was a clause that I had to provide service records. This clause was NOWHERE to be found, yet it was what they tried to use to not give me my money."
1039241,Snidley,2019-01-14 19:38:00,620,"The overall truth about aftermarket extended auto warranties is that it is an industry that runs companies for a limited time and then they go bust leaving customers in the lurch. It started years ago with International  Warranty which was mainly offered by Toyota dealerships. The Toyota reputation basically smoothed the way forward for most Toyotas leaving dealerships with an extended International Warranty. When they went bust it was a massive shock to the automotive marletplace. Think about it, if Toyota's can drive a warranty company out of business what possible chance would a warranty company have when the vehicals in question are Chryslers. Add in a 100% refund of fees paid for the warranty 4 or 5 years later and I would say that fraud would be 100% of the business model. Similar to financial advisers that just fought tooth and nail to have their scam NOT covered by a fiduciary obligation to clients or health clubs that refuse to do business without a credit card or direct monthly deposit from your bank account. With these industries basically there is no business model that does not include fraud as a mainstay of the business. When you look closely  virtually EVERY business includes some sort of fraud or chicanery to make the $ come in. This weeks Marketplace just exposed 50 to 70% rebates (a polite name for kickbacks) on pharmcuticals and Imams writing up unregistered wedding contracts for guys wanting a second wife. So the best advice for consumers is to consider every business transaction they get involved with as an opportunity to get scammed and then, to govern themselves accordingly."
1039259,John Bacon,2019-01-15 04:03:00,3277,Did you mean pharmaceuticals?  Are they somehow involved in a second wife?
1039261,chris.brock,2019-01-15 05:16:00,4053,"I don't buy that. These guys read their contracts, the reasons for getting denied the refund aren't even in the contract, and the salesperson repeatedly, verbally guaranteed the money would be refunded if the warranty wasn't used. To suggest they were naive isn't fair. This is obviously a total scam, fraud."
1039265,Snidley,2019-01-15 09:14:00,620,"Illegal rebates on pharmacuticals of up to 70% of retail and , as a separate story, illegal 2nd (and actually up to 4)wives  sanctioned by rouge Imams with pre printed contracts of marriage that apply to second wives but those same  marriges are never registered so go undetected. Bet they cost however. Amazingly bigamy is a 5 year sentance here but these dudes are not worried. And of course why would they be, who has the jam to confront Imams anymore."
1039342,BillM,2019-01-16 16:50:00,17367,How did a thread about XWRP warranty scams somehow turn into a thread about rouge Imams?   Stay on topic man.

1039718,tomkat,2019-01-26 16:55:00,246,My policy is never buy extended warranty for anything and so far it has served me well. When I buy a new vehicle as soon as I sit down I tell them no service plans no extended warranty no rust protection fabric protection paint protection blah blah blah. They always look at me like they can’t believe it and I am the first person ever to not buy all that crap lol!
1039788,Rizzo,2019-01-28 16:21:00,4754,"Tomkat that is also my policy...had never bought an extended warranty on anything...until this one. And I was adamant I didn't want it. Didn't even want to hear about. The salesperson convinced me to listen. ""Don't use the warranty, you get all your money back"". That was a type of ""insurance"" I was willing to get. If I had a huge repair bill I am covered, if I don't bother using the warranty then I get my 2500.00 back...all I miss out on is the interest that 2500 would have earned me in 5 years...in other words nothing to lose! We even had one $500 repair that we didn't get fixed thru warranty because we didn't want to jeopardize our refund. When it came time to get my 2500 back this is NOT how it all worked out. Not only will I refuse these sales pitches in the future...I will literally laugh when offered it."
1027926,Rizzo,2018-05-05 22:12:00,4754,"Good luck iionly. I also was never warned about going over the limit in kms. We did after an IMMENSE amount of screaming get a partial refund from xwrp...They gave us $2000 out of the $2500...just enough for me to let the matter rest. To be honest I am sTILL ticked at how the Dodge dealership dealt with me thru this whole process. They were horrible and did not give a crap about helping one of their customers. I may still file complaints against the lady I have dealt with. Terrible that you have to go to court to get your money. My understanding from Dodge is take xwrp to court and you will win...just sad that they sell this stuff to their clients knowing the grief it will cause you. Where do they find people who can do this job, knowing they are screwing you, and then sleep at night?"
1027929,iionly,2018-05-05 22:22:00,9,"Yeah they offered me about 33% of what they owe me. But I won't accept that. I want my full payment. The way they work is to deny and hope that no one will fight it. I still may put out for a class action suit as I'm sure it was more than just a couple of people that xwrp has screwed over. I even found some of their training slideshows that give an example of a situation where a customer goes over the km but are still eligible for a refund. they state in the slideshow that the customer just has to wait for the 5 year anniversary of the warranty to receive the refund.   slide 45 of this slideshow here: https://www.slideserve.com/brendy/today-s-market The xwrp guy pretended that he was trying to help me in the beginning. saying that he would do what he could and go to bat for me. complete Bull When I told him he would be going to court he said no problem. I don't yell at people, but he had me close to doing it. either way I know I will win, it just sucks that I have to go through all the effort to do this when it should have been a simple here's the info, here's your refund."
1027930,iionly,2018-05-05 22:27:00,9,and did you get the refund through xwrp or did the dealership get it for you?
1027937,Rizzo,2018-05-06 01:50:00,4754,"Dealership did not do squat. Wouldnt return my calls wouldn't return my emails...basically said screw you, we got our cut not interested in helping.  I eventually got the 2 k from xwrp but like I said there was a LOT of yelling and anger on my part. I bet the xwrp guy who said he would help you was Walter. Some of them were confrontational, Walter had me believing he was on my side...pretended to care pretended to be nice. He isn't. Just his way of trying to act like the nice guy...but then they still decline your claim. Like I said, not sure where they find these employees. Which dealership you deal with? Dodge as well?"
1027942,iionly,2018-05-06 03:23:00,9,"Yep it was Walter who was pretending to help me out too. And same dealership that you dealt with, Waterloo Dodge is where I bought my van. Don't even get me started on the bait and switch that they pulled when I bought my van. That was a nightmare so I shouldn't have expected anything else. However,  will say that the lady who sold me mine did at least write a letter for me explaining that the warranty was sold to me under the premise that mileage would not void the warranty. This guy Walter is just a real tool. He really made me mad. I know that if I were to go to a judge with my information I will win the case so as soon as they receive the plaintiff's claim for small claims court they will most likely offer to settle. However, I will take nothing less than 100% of what they owe me. I won't let them get away with the crap they have been trying to pull on so many customers."
1027944,Old Ironmaker,2018-05-06 03:55:00,8243,"Yep you made the deal in a Chrysler dealership office with a Chrysler employee being paid by Chrysler and then when you need to deal with something you find out it is a second party you must deal with some office at doesn't have an address . I don't want to say it's only Chrysler because all the big car dealers and small Mom and Pops sell you the product from a second party. They all have Insurance companies that all deal with all the big 3 and all the European and Asian manufacturers. My wife recently bought a used Kia from a Ford dealer and wanted her to sit down for 30 minutes with the dealers business kid to go over the myriad of extended warranties. I said to him to not waste his time and more importantly hers and mine to sell he insurance policy. The 20 something year olds response was basically we couldn't buy the car unless he could go through the entire pitch. I told him to go see the Sales Manager we just made the deal with that we are cancelling the deal and she wants her deposit back, go, now, hurry up, I'm hungry. We just walked out while he was looking for him. But was only doing the job he was given and I respect that, but No is No thank you. I actually called back to ask a question about the paperwork he gave her and never received a return call. I know what As Is means, I watch Judge Judy. By the way she and we are happy with the Kia Optima after 2 months. More than 1/2 the fuel consumption on that 220 HP 4 banger than my 1/2 ton Chevy, at least, probably more. 2 fill ups a week in winter with the 4X4 when she drove it daily for her safe winter commute, now she passes gas stations for 2 weeks and it never goes below a quarter."
1027954,Rizzo,2018-05-06 16:33:00,4754,"Knew it had to be Walter. Guess they train their staff to play good cop bad cop...he gets to pretend to be the good cop...then screws you over like the rest. Well if you go to court I would be pleased to help any way I can. Do me a favour...name Waterloo Dodge in the suit as well. They know FULL WELL what is going on, yet they continue to sell this warranty knowing their clients are getting screwed. I would be pleased to join you in court or do whatever it takes to show these people you can't treat people like this"
1030913,Mbshizzie,2018-07-09 23:11:00,3,I think I'm going to have the same fight on my hands....just recently sent them the paperwork minus the service records...I'm wondering if it's worth arguing with them or going straight to a lawyer....any tips would be appreciated.
1030916,iionly,2018-07-09 23:26:00,9,Well I would go to a lawyer at the first sign of them fighting you. Trust me they do not want to honor this warranty. I still havn't sent this off to my lawyer. I know they will lose in court though. I have even found more information on the internet to back my claim. The biggest hurdle will be the actual serving of the claim to the company.
1030920,Rizzo,2018-07-10 02:01:00,4754,"Make them show you the clause that says you have to provide service records. I went LINE BY LINE through all the documentation with one of their managers...eventually they caved. Took craploads of emails and phonecalls before I got a manager. Have your warranty book in hand as well. Mine said nothing about service records. They have some bogus line about ""what is not covered"" section... it also says nothing about service records. Good luck. There IS a clause that gets them off the hook if you have gone over 100k so definitely don't send in records if you are over 100k! If you are under 100 k and have all the records just send em in. My problem was we didn't keep the records, and when I sent some in they always insisted on more"
1030926,chris.brock,2018-07-10 04:36:00,4053,"why pay a lawyer? do it yourself A lot of people assume that once they have won a claim they automatically get they money. Nope. The laws suck. I won a claim against the Terrace Ford in Burlington snakes. I had to show up in the showroom a few times, it's not until I made a mild disturbance in front of other customers that they finally handed over the cheque. It was some hassle and stress but I think it's better than paying paper pushing, money grabbing lawyers. "
1030927,iionly,2018-07-10 04:43:00,9,"I'll be going to a lawyer for 1 reason. It won't go to trial. The company knows that they will not win, therefore they will settle. However, I believe that it will require being served with a plaintiff's claim drafted by a legal representative. I say this because I personally have sent them a letter of intent and their response was to offer me 33% of the amount owed. Keep in mind that I have gone to school to draft these letters. Once they receive the letter from an actual lawyer they will settle."
1030938,Mbshizzie,2018-07-10 14:34:00,3,Thanks for the  insight Rizzo...Im in the exact same boat as  you...I have some service  records but am missing some and this place doesn't keep historical records like that. I think my best bet is to argue that it doesn't say anywhere that I have to provide service records
1030939,Snidley,2018-07-10 14:45:00,620,Going to a lawyer over small amounts like this is usually counterproductive as the lawyer will eat up all of the money owed and judges /ajudicaters often take a dim view of showing up in small claims with a lawyer. I suggest a paralegal with experience in automotive. More cost effective. Still no results/response  from  OMVIC?This seems like a gross infraction of automotive consumer law to me and dealing with car dealers who cross the line is their mandate.
1030972,chris.brock,2018-07-11 03:28:00,4053,"screw the letter of intent, $75 to file your personal claim (no lawyer) and they will collapse, why give most of your money to a lawyer? Your talking about settling too. They're snakes, scammers. You don't have to settle, you should be totally refunded plus expenses. I've used small claims 3 times, no lawyers for me, won every time because I was scammed and the judge could see that. When they would lie in court and I would get angry the judge recognized who was telling the truth."
1030974,Old Ironmaker,2018-07-11 09:00:00,8243,"Chris is absolutely right, no need whatsoever to pay a lawyer for small claims court. I too filed 3 claims in Small Claims. Settled for about 80% twice outside the court room with the defendants lawyer and got in front of a Judge once and won. The problem with the case I won was it was a bogus contractor that had no way to pay up. You should file suit against both the dealership and the warranty scammers. I have an extended warranty with I don't even know who when I bought the Silverado brand new off the lot. I better dig it up because I have not had a claim either and may be eligible for a refund too. I have every service record since new. The dealer only did 2 oil changes and some brake and rear end work under new car bumper to bumper warranty. I have gotten all the service records for anything ever done, only tires, a battery and oil service in 7 years. My guy recently sent me PDF's of everything ever done to the truck. A big reason I go to 1 shop and only 1 for service for both vehicles, I'm big on that. No need for a lawyer. Bring suit against the dealer and if the judge says you need to go after the other guy it only costs you 75 bucks, easy for me to say I'm retired and have time to do that. If you insist on representation go the Paralegal route."
1032923,sfishy,2018-08-22 17:04:00,1,Rizzo the xwrp is not a dodge product. and the stipulations that were told to you when you bought it were correct! Do not beat up on the poor lady that is also being sidlined. The xwrp company went bankrupt and the insurance company is using every tactic they can to not pay out
1032952,Rizzo,2018-08-23 01:58:00,4754,"Poor lady that is being sidelined? I do not know what that means. I DO know that the lady who convinced me to buy...when i was adamantly refusing to even listen...was an employee of DODGE. They did not bring in an insurance rep. A Dodge employee sold it to me. A Dodge employee profited when i bought it. And that same Dodge employee, who now manages the dealership, would not even refund to me the portion they themselves kept. They KNEW i was being screwed. At a minimum they should have apologized and offered me back the portion that they themselves profited. I would have walked away thinking ""what an upstanding operation"". Sadly they did not offer me anything...which is incredibly short sighted on their part. They had a chance to keep a customer happy. Not only did they lose me, i tell others of my terrible experience. They could have broken even...give me back the portion they kept. Instead they have chosen to take a loss...my future business with them and all the people I talk to. It still boggles my mind that they did not at least try to make things right"
1032954,angelcanon,2018-08-23 12:24:00,11,"Hi Rizzo trust me when I say your not the only 1 to have fallen for this, these companies use what ever tactic nets them the most money, if you want something from these companies you'll get it if your spending money, but god help you if your attempting to get something from them even if your owed."
1039114,Kverde,2019-01-11 22:18:00,7,"I’m the latest victim :( So glad to come across this group to get feedback and advise. Bought a 2014 Dodge Grand Caravan to drive to and from work and back and forth from Toronto to North Dakota to visit family.  When purchasing vehicle, they suggested this warranty due to excessive km’s we would be using.  We have 4 kids and have to be really careful with our money.  When we reached the 100,000 km mark I spoke to the dealership about getting my extended warranty money back and they said we had to wait till the 5 year mark passed.  Five years or 100,000 km which ever is reached last.  I have patiently waited and submitted my claim on the 5 year anniversary date.  Just got my letter declining my request because they said it was based on km’s not time.  I would never have bought it, I knew I would reach the km’s prior to the five year mark.  I was sold it because I would be using a lot of km’s. So upset, we were really counting on the money."
1039117,Old Ironmaker,2019-01-11 22:38:00,8243,Another victim. Based on this thread when my brother bought his brand new Ram last month he referred the seller to this thread based on what I have learned from Rizzo's dilemma and my recommendation. The guy at the dealership didn't have much to say other than his insurance was the best. Yea right.
1039120,Rizzo,2019-01-11 22:46:00,4754,"Sorry to hear that Kverde. We were never told that if we went over the 100 k that we wouldn't get our money back. Only thing we were told was ""If you don't use the warranty you get all your money back...including taxes"". When I was fighting for my claim I did notice some wording that made me realize that if I had gone over the 100 k before the 5 years, they could decline the refund. Never noticed this in the beginning, and it certainly never was mentionned. Only found that info once they declined me and I read everything over 20 times trying to figure out what basis they had to screw me. You may be in for a tough battle because there is a tricky little phrase there about exceeding 100 k before 60 months is up (at least my documentation had that ""out"" clause for them). What dealership did you buy from?"
1039127,Kverde,2019-01-12 00:38:00,7,"I bought the van at Woodbine Chrysler in Markham, Ontario.  I have placed a call to them and they said they have never had an issue with the program and will look into it tomorrow.  I am extremely disappointed and feel like I’ve been cheated and misled.  I will fight it the best I can.  One of the comments made here mentions a slideshow that may help me.  Thank you all so much, can’t tell you how much this forum means to me right now.

1039141,Rizzo,2019-01-12 04:19:00,4754,"interesting...never saw that slideshow before. Although it never says ""the refund will be given"" it certainly doesn't say there is no point to apply for your refund. If that were the case (going over voids the warranty) it should say it plain and clear right there. You go over in the 4th year...don't even bother applying"
1026825,LeeC,2018-04-17 19:32:00,3,"Chrispy, Out of curiosity, do you recall whether your refund included the cost of the warranty refund application (in my case, $395 + tax), or just the cost of the warranty + tax? All of the paperwork seems to indicate that the refund includes this cost, but they told me that it wasn't part of the refund. Had I known that I was going to pay $500 to possibly get $1000 back, I probably wouldn't have bothered signing up for the warranty refund in the first place. Thanks, Lee"
1026826,Chrispy,2018-04-17 19:38:00,168,"Hey Lee, It was just what I paid for the warranty....I think it was around $2500.00 bucks I got back so I don't think the tax was included.....after all the crap I went through to get the money, I took what I got and was happy I didn't get ripped off totally....the guy that I buy my vehicles helped me get all the receipts from the dealership and even faxed them in for me.....I went back and gave him $250 bucks in Keg and Liquor store cards....so ask the person that sold you the vehicle if they are still there.....might be able to help you out a little.....  Chrispy!"
1026828,Old Ironmaker,2018-04-17 20:47:00,8243,"Any update on the issue Rizzo? As someone said this thread has a common thing throughout. Chrysler vehicle and service issues. Each and every person I know well that has one is not happy. One good pal had the tires rotated and a few weeks later a wheel came off, yes he torqued them, he is a retired Class A mechanic. Lucky no one was killed. Plenty of fender damage and a new wheel, tire and lug nuts were required, he fought with Chrysler for months to no avail, including hiring a Lawyer. He almost fell over when he got the estimate for 1 wheel, rotor and lug nuts, the nuts were 70 some odd bucks each, Wowza. I had an 02' Intrepid I leased and bought out. That thing cost me a pretty penny as soon as the warranty period was over, 3 transmission communications modules, whatever that is, at $1000.00 a pop. You couldn't pay me to own a late model Chrysler, OK maybe a Hellcat."
1026839,Rizzo,2018-04-17 22:31:00,4754,"Update is this...tonight I send an email to the General Manager of Waterloo Dodge. She is the one who promised up and down the warranty is NOT too good to be true, and that truly, if you don't use it you get all your money back. She is also the one who I have been butting heads with (they won't stand behind what they sell...just tell me to hire a lawyer then I will get my money). I am going to propose a reasonable settlement because at the end of the day I want this nightmare over. If she refuses? I have many many plans, one includes taking both her and Dodge Waterloo to court if it has to go that far. But many things up my sleeve. Crazy thing is, if she had just helped in the first place (not told me that I am irking her, not telling me she is too busy to return my call,  not telling me to hire a lawyer, not hanging up on me) things would have been totally different. They are their own worst enemy. Help me get my money and you have found a loyal customer. Basically tell me to get lost? You have formed an enemy and a tenacious one at that! Don't these businesses understand you are ruining yourself if you don't solve people's issues?"
1026841,Snidley,2018-04-17 23:25:00,620,"Back in the day Toyota dealers used to sell an extended warranty called International Warranty. It was NOT in any way affiliated with Toyota other that they seemed to be the largest, but not only, group of dealers selling it. That was a great warranty that did pay out, EXCEPT when  they went bust, leaving everybody holding the bag. As I remember there was no recourse through the dealers and there was lots of bad blood, but people kept  buying Toyotas. Now imagine a warranty company that goes bust covering Toyotas, with no refund ever offered re non use of warranty service and compare that to a warranty that covers Chryco's AND offers a refund in the unlikely event that the warranty is never used and I give you TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE.  Hopefully Rizzo gets his refund but I think anyone who has read this post should consider NEVER buying vehicals from or extended warranties  for Chryco/Dodge/Jeep or the Koreans, or the coming Chinese brands. Needless to say if Russians still sold cars in Canada they would be super suspect too. Many in the car busines would also look askance at Nissan, Mazda, GM and Ford as well but that's a big chunk of the Automotive business. Even the Germans do not make cars as reliably as in the past and I've heard lots of complaints about engines in Honda/Acura as well. I will add that Honda small outboards are suspect. My buddy bought a 2017 Honda outboard that had rpm issues out of the box and after much back and forth re fixing the motor Honda gave up and said they could not fix a brand new motor. They have offered a complete refund that has yet to be paid with dealer comments saying it's a problem with all 2017 Honda's up to 9 hp. Makes it hard to carry a positive mental attitude about modrern manufactuing. Auto finance/back office has always been a den of thieves to a level that would curl your hair."
1026843,G.mech,2018-04-17 23:58:00,830,"This has absolutely NOTHING to do with 'Chrysler' (who is actually FCA now) service issues.  If you read this through carefully, it is a third party warranty company that the OP has his beef with because he DID NOT use his warranty which seems to me indicates that he hasn't had any serious issues with the vehicle..  The dealer however doesn't seem to want to help him out which is the sad part."
1026847,Snidley,2018-04-18 02:55:00,620,"Same guy that bought the Honda outboard has a Ram diesel 2500 for towing 3 snowmobiles and, at work, a welding rig. He has had nothing but trouble with it but there are very few options for his circumstances. You want to buy an FCA product keep this thread in mind  and remember the stink starts at the head and moves down. If you have options look elsewhere, and at all times beware of backoffice closers at car dealerships. That's where they make their money and it is always at the customers expense. Warranties are best when offered by the manufacturer but if you talk frankly with Chrysler/FCA dealers they will tell you that there have been numerous issues with factory warranties FOR THEM. This should not effect you as a retail customer but keep this issue in mind when you have a warranty issue and they can't find or solve the problem. In there car business there are many ways to skin a cat. You are the cat."
1026849,Old Ironmaker,2018-04-18 03:16:00,8243,"You need to relax man. I DO NOT need to read  anything carefully as 'I'm not being paid to pay attention. Relax will you, it's a discussion forum for God sakes and nothing more. Will there be a test?"
1026857,G.mech,2018-04-18 10:10:00,830,"Okay, make you  a deal...... I will relax if you try thinking twice before posting comments that are barely relevant to the conversation at hand because you don't get paid to read the thread.  How's that???  I don't get paid to relax either but I could give it a try I guess, I'm pretty flexible."
1026859,DanD,2018-04-18 10:49:00,2223,"This is a question not a statement. Doesn't this dealership (Not Chrysler) have everything to do with this. They are the ones that sold the warrantee and profited by the sale, to the customer. This may not be a good one but here an example of what I'm trying to say and this really happened. I sold an engine that I bought from a machine shop. There's an issue with the engine and the machine shop won't repair it. My customer wants to sue the machine shop; but is told (By his lawyer) that he'd have to sue me; because I'm the one that sold it to him. I would then have to go after the machine shop; if I wanted compensation. So if Rizzo paid the dealership; are they not the ones to honor the contract? Maybe there's a waiver that releases the dealership in the signed contract? Dan."
1026862,Rizzo,2018-04-18 12:33:00,4754,"you are with me Dan. The dealership keeps telling me to go after xwrp (which i have, trust me). Since I am having troubles with xwrp...I go back to the source. The dealership took my $, the dealership convinced me this was a no risk situation etc. Not to mention, the dealership (according to my contract) kept $1800 and xwrp got $465. The dealership made the promises, the dealership made the big profit, hence I have chosen to pursue them. And yes, my feeling is that if the dealership wants to pursue xwrp for whatever they had to pay me, that is up to them"
1026866,Mister G,2018-04-18 12:51:00,1429,You're SCREWED and you know it...........LOL........JK........I hope.

1026877,John Bacon,2018-04-18 14:54:00,3277,"  Ethically, I would agree with DanD.  Chrysler should honour the terms of the agreement that they sold.  If they chose to outsource their warranty to an unethical company, that's their problem.  They should go after the warranty company to recover the funds that they pay out to their customers.  	Similarly, I think Toyota should have honoured the extended warranties that they sold to their customers.  It's not the customers fault that Toyota chose to outsource their extended warranty to a financially unstable company.  	Legally, I am sure that they have covered their behinds and are not liable.  I just don't think that it's an ethical way of doing business."
1026880,G.mech,2018-04-18 14:59:00,830,"I agree John B, my point was that it's not an issue with service department, poor service, or wheels falling off etc.    The dealer (ie sales department)  should help get this resolved whether they are legally obligated to do so or not; it's called customer service."
1026883,jimmer,2018-04-18 16:26:00,2730,"So, I'm learning from this conversation that extended warranties from contracted companies might not be a good idea. I don't think I have ever bought one other than my wife insisting on it once with a used car.  I thought it was a waste of $$$$. Good luck Rizzo, I hope you can recoup some $$$$."
1026884,Snidley,2018-04-18 16:28:00,620,"I will repeat. You are the cat. Do not expect the car dealersahip to be helpfull as this is not in their best interest, burning customers with shady financial instruments is in their best interest and consequently this is what they will do today and in the future. It has always been so in the auto trade, including at Toyota dealerships. Hopefully for Rizzo pressure can be brought to bear by OMVIC or the courts or even the consequences of consumer pressure.  The lesson to be had here is that finance, be it at car dealerships , at chartered banks, financial planners, brokerages, or insurance entities is a frightfully unethical business built and run by scoundrels and sanctioned by our authorities. This is unlikely to change now or ever. As the saying goes ""man is wolf to other man"" Protect yourself as best you can by resisting any sales inducement that seems to be a ""no brainer"" or too good to be true in your favour.  ESPECIALLY IN FINANCE"
1026903,LeeC,2018-04-19 00:37:00,3,"Yes, one way to view this is that warranty refunds are a scam and Chrysler is complicit in peddling this deceitful product. Another possible take-away for anyone following this thread is this: if you buy an extended warranty (with or without a refund option), you MUST keep meticulous service records. I was lucky to get my refund, but if I had an issue and needed to use the extended warranty I would have been just as screwed. It says on the back of the warranty contract that it is the owner's obligation to maintain service records, but I simply didn't read all the fine print when I was buying the vehicle (they bury you in paperwork, and I'm sure few people read everything)."
1026904,Rizzo,2018-04-19 00:51:00,4754,the back of the contract says service records will be required for repair work. It does not say it will be required for warranty refund
1026905,chris.brock,2018-04-19 01:13:00,4053,"  It wasn't an extended warranty thing but I took both Ford Credit and Terrace Ford Burlington to small claims because they played the same game and blamed each other, both giving the run around. The judge nailed Terrace with the full amount and court costs. pm me if you want, then maybe we could chat on the phone, I don't want to see these snakes win and continue screwing people"
1026910,Snidley,2018-04-19 04:10:00,620,A couple of things Rizzo. I would be interested in hearing what OMVIC has to say about this issue. I find it hard to believe that you are the only agrieved consumer burned by this scam. Also I have in the past had issues like this get resolved when a notice to appear turned up at the dealership and the warranty provider. I think that these pricks don't realy take a complaint seriously until such time as court paperwork turns up and they have to prepare a court defense. Small claims can offer a solution and there are cost effective paraleagals that specialize in small claims. A succesful claim would include reasonable legal costs in addition to the disputed amounts.
1026911,John Bacon,2018-04-19 04:19:00,3277,One way?  You mean there's another way to view it?
1026913,DanD,2018-04-19 10:36:00,2223,"My daughter's coworkers will not comment on this, unless they had a chance to review the contract. She suggests to fine a law firm that offers a free consultation. Even a letter of intent from a law firm; could be enough to get them moving? Dan"
1026919,BillM,2018-04-19 13:55:00,17367,I still think your issue here is with XWRP and not the dealership.  I think you're going after the wrong people.

The last one says I went over the mileage, however it was sold to me stating that it can only expire by time. So if I went over 100k before five years I still can claim the refund but I have to wait until the 5 year anniversary. I even have a letter from the dealership stating that this was the terms that i agreed to. So I'm going to take xwrp to small claims court. I will be filing sometime this month. I just need to get some input from a paralegal to help me with the claim. Have you resolved your  issue yet?"

1026360,Old Ironmaker,2018-04-13 20:08:00,8243,"Like each and every insurance provider including Workers Compensation it is procedure that they deny each and every claim that is before them. My sis in law worked in the Insurance business as a claims adjuster with a national firm and without even read the details a standard form  letter denying any claim was sent out the insured. You have to be like a Dog with a bone, don't give up. They want to make it such a Hell dealing with them they want you to tap out, don't. Being relentless in this type of Bull has served me well over the years. You have to work your way up the chain of command. Many times I wanted to give in, like I said don't quit. I have 3 times taken Corps to Small Claims court. only once we went before a Magistrate, and that lasted 10 minutes before she ruled in my favour. $10,000.00 max in Ontario for small claims. I think it was $75.00 to file 10 years ago."
1026361,GBW,2018-04-13 20:11:00,8460,"I work at Lindsay Kia in the service department and I am not on commission, salary.  We ONLY tell the customer what is needed and when.  If the car is not fit to leave (brake pad's less than 2mm and falling apart) we tell them.  If they do not do the work we get a signature they refused.  You know Dan, must be more than 3mm pad for a safety.  The service manager has been calling shops all over including other Kia's and well, our door rate is the lowest around and we have some very high reviews all the time.  Not all dealers are bad, trust me.  Kia Canada is doing audits to all locations (currently, ours today) to ensure there is no funny business. Rizzo, sorry the hear this and good luck.  I hope you get it all sorted out ASAP!"
1026377,Rizzo,2018-04-13 22:48:00,4754,"Dude I am relentless....so yes I have contacted OMVIC. Normally I am very mild mannered but this has me super ticked off. The way they convinced me to do it, when I told them over and over I wasn't interested in it, is what really has me miffed. Sales lady flat out lied (or made a mistake)...but if its a mistake do you not do your best to make things right for your client? I have started a file with omvic, but have not made it official. Still trying to give time for Waterloo Dodge to do the honourable thing."
1026388,LeeC,2018-04-14 01:25:00,3,"Rizzo, I feel your pain. I'm going through the exact same thing. Purchased Dodge Caravan and warranty (with warranty refund) from Chrysler dealer in 2013, was told I get my money back if I don't use it. Sent all the required paperwork within the 60 days of warranty expiration, and they came back asking for service records. I had spotty records as best, but was able to gather the necessary proof of oil changes. When I asked where it stated this was required, he referred me to exemption 3c on the warranty refund program application which states that the warranty refund is void if ""the Applicant has caused the Warranty Contract to become invalid for any reason identified by the ""Exclusion"" or ""What is Not Covered"" section of the Warranty Contract"". On the back of the Warranty Contract (which Chrysler calls the Service Contract), it states that it is the owners responsibility maintain proof of all maintenance records. What a joke. They are using a loophole to get out of the refund. Their claim is that failure to provide maintenance receipts violates the terms of the warranty, thus invalidating the warranty refund. In my case, I was fortunate enough to be able to obtain oil change records (one of which I did myself, so a photo of the screen showing the oil was purchased the Canadian Tire had to suffice). Earlier this week, I received my refund cheque (a small victory). Of course, the amount they refunded didn't include the warranty refund application fee, even though it clearly states the definition of ""Refund"" is the purchase price of the warranty contract, to a maximum of $4000 (the same maximum they list in the purchase price box, but not the same amount the refunded). I'm trying to fight that battle now, but thinking my only recourse is the BBB. When I called fearing I didn't have the necessary paperwork, the guy on the phone suggested I write a letter explaining that it wasn't made clear that maintenance records were required, and he would ""fight for me"". If all else fails, you could try this. In the end, the frustrating part is that you DIDN'T USE THE WARRANTY, so the maintenance records aren't relevant. I feel your pain, because I went through the same thing. I'm very frustrated that my dealer didn't make it more clear how important this was. Best of luck to you, I hope you can stick it to them. Lee"
1026402,Rizzo,2018-04-14 03:10:00,4754,Thanks Lee. I continue to battle on!
1026408,ecmilley,2018-04-14 03:37:00,2163,All warranty company's are a pain to deal with. Get chrysler gold plan.warranty no.hassle can run part numbers and labour ops at work station for coverage and.get customer back on rd as quick as possible. You have a eco diesel just get rid of it there a turd anyway regardless of what anyone else thinks not only emissions but under built bottom. Ends changed more engines than I can count for connecting rod failures
1026427,Rattletrap2,2018-04-14 16:17:00,1652,"Dan, I know we drifted off topic a bit here, but you have every right to be proud of your business and record with your customers. I have been in the service industry all my life, but never for myself. I did work for mostly private run companies though. None of them had any interest in running a business with your philosophy though. I never understood that. One has been in business for 96 years. They just believe that when they screw someone over..... there are plenty more fish in the sea! Seems to be true! I would think a harmonious relationship with customers would make for a far more rewarding career. "
1026429,Old Ironmaker,2018-04-14 16:39:00,8243,"The BBB is a toothless organization. I wouldn't waste my time with them. My Chevy is still under extended warranty and I'm not the greatest record keeper. That is why I deal with 1 garage and only 1. Yes I may miss a few sales on oil service but I'll take the hit. I asked for my service records from day 1 and they emailed me each and every one in a PDF. The 3 previous services were at the GM dealer, what a joke, 1.5 hrs to change oil and filter and a quick visual inspection and 15 bucks more. Nice fancy waiting room with WiFi though."
1026442,Snidley,2018-04-14 17:22:00,620,"Seems to be one issue in this discussion that permeates the thread, Dodge/Chrysler. Maybe that's a signal to refrain from purchasing anything from this firm. When I was in the car business years ago this firm was a subject of  many negative issues and on many, many occasions. This problem was corporate as well as at the dealer level. Rot starts at the head and migrates down the body, so to speak."
1026450,Lape0019,2018-04-14 18:48:00,647,"Just as an FYI, I was offered the same warranty when I bought my 2013 Chevy. I turned it down as I put too many Kilometers on a vehicle in a year to even worry about extended waranties. Sucks for the OP and anyone else caught up in this. Hope you get this sorted out!"
1026666,DanD,2018-04-16 10:21:00,2223,"GBW. I was talking about the sales staff; sorry if you took offence. My wife is a service adviser at a GM dealership and no she's not on commission either. She been so pissed at the sales people for tell un-truths, just to make a sale. Then the customer comes into service and have to be told; that no their vehicle can't fly. Dan."
1026688,Mister G,2018-04-16 13:24:00,1429,If you purchase a extended warranty with the thought of not using it and getting all your money returned it would have been better to place said amount that this product cost into a interest bearing saving account and then if repairs were needed the money was there but if no repairs were needed you have full access to YOUR money plus interest over the years. It's called a win win in my eyes. BTW I never take out a extended warranty for anything. I hope you get your money back ASAP..........
1026715,John Bacon,2018-04-16 15:29:00,3277,"Realistically, they cannot afford to give every one who doesn't use the warranty their money back.  They need that money to pay for the people who have major repairs.  The only way they can stay in business is if they can find excuses not to refund the warranties.    It's obviously not the most ethical way to do business, but they cannot make this offer without there being a catch somewhere."
1026824,Chrispy,2018-04-17 19:24:00,168,"Hey Rizzo, same thing happened to me....bought the extended warranty for my Jeep, traded it in after 5 years and bought my new Dodge Ram......went to put in for my money back and had to jump through hoops.....stayed on it, talked to some pissy little Dude a couple times.....I let him know that I work in IT and I am going to go out to social media and let them know about their piece of @#$% company.......about a month later after sending in yet another bunch of service receipts I got the full payment....was a real pain in the you know what.....my wife kept telling me don't even bother, you are not getting your money back, she should have known better I am like a Bulldog when it comes to MY money....keep it up Brother!!  Chrispy!"
1026218,Rizzo,2018-04-12 01:01:00,4754,"Bought  an extended warranty back in 2013. Initially adamantly refused to even listen to the sale pitch. Lady (and I use this term loosely) convinces me to listen...she swears up and down ""don't use the warranty you get all the money back"" Stupid me. I buy it to the tune of $2500. Now I am fighting tooth and nail  with Waterloo Dodge to get my money back and nobody willing to pay up. And no, I did not use the warranty. Dodge is refusing to help, Saying the problem is with the insurer (xwrp). I have already jumped thru the hoops XWRP is sending my way and they keep looking for loopholes. Sad thing is, I sat with a Dodge rep,,  gave my money to Dodge rep, signed a contract with a Dodge rep,... and what does this same sales person tell me now? Hire a lawyer, Apparently her unhappy customers hire lawyers to get back the money they were promised. Craziest thing? That employee is now the manger. Do car dealerships reward dishonest actions with promotions? Has anyone else heard of this or am I the only one being poorly treated by Dodge refusing to stand by their word?"
1026221,BillM,2018-04-12 01:12:00,17367,"After a few mins of searching,  you apply for the refund directly with XWRP.   XWRP gets confirmation from Dodge that you did in fact have no warranty claims and mails you the cheque. What part of this are they saying that you haven't fullfilled?"
1026224,Rizzo,2018-04-12 01:52:00,4754,"Exactly. We did everything they asked... there are 4 or 5 things they ask you to send in...so we did. Then they send me a letter saying we are declined because we did not provide all service records. Of course, they never asked for these service records to be sent in the first place! Just instant decline. So now I am left trying to track down all service records for a 5 year old van. This isn't the easiest...one place we used is out of business, etc etc. Pain in butt. Having a hard time getting all the records...one of our oil changes was in Myrtle Beach! All Dodge said when they convinced me was ""don't use the warranty, you get your money back""."
1026225,BillM,2018-04-12 01:54:00,17367,"Oil changes aren't under warranty though..   Why are they asking for receipts for oil changes? Read this, apparently from a dealer.  All Dodge has to send them is a statement saying you haven't had any warranty claims.  The fact that they're asking for service records makes no sense.  http://forums.redflagdeals.com/merged-chrysler-dodge-jeep-questions-answers-897070/6/"
1026228,Rizzo,2018-04-12 01:57:00,4754,"...and out of that $2500, Dodge actually got the bulk of it is my understanding...xwrp only a few hundred (I have been fighting this for weeks now, probably 40-50 calls and emails to both xwrp and Dodge)Yet this Dodge employee is basically saying, yes I took your money, yes I told you don't use the warranty you get your money back, no I am not going to help you get it back you are on your own I got my commission"
1026230,Rizzo,2018-04-12 02:00:00,4754,"Bill I sent that statement in that we had no warranty work, that was one of the initial 4 or 5 things we knew we had to send. Why do you think I am so ticked and posting it here! I told them the same thing...oil changes have nothing to do with it. If I WANTED warranty work, then I can understand why they need proof I maintained the vehicle. All I want is ""you don't use the warranty you get your money back"""
1026231,BillM,2018-04-12 02:00:00,17367,"I'd stop dealing with Dodge, they aren't the ones that you're going to get money from.   XWRP is."
1026232,Rizzo,2018-04-12 02:08:00,4754,"Bill I am pursuing both relentlessly. XWRP has no right not to refund my money so of course I continue to fight with them, and Dodge has been lying to me so the fight continues there. But why should I have to fight? Dodge never told me this would happen, and now that it is, they are doing nothing to help. You DO NOT just get your money back when you send in the documents they request. If you did, I would have my money by now!"
1026233,chris.brock,2018-04-12 02:31:00,4053,"Why sweat it? It's $75 to register a small claim in court. I've done it 3 times, easy process. I wouldn't bother with their Bull. Put the dealership and xwrp on the form."
1026234,Rizzo,2018-04-12 02:41:00,4754,"Thanks Chris. I actually did look into that option a week or two ago. The site I looked it up on said there are court fees but it didn't say they were only $75! Here I figured it was gonna be hundreds to file a claim. This is a great idea if they don't eventually relent and give me my money. This has been a massive headache, has caused me stress and lack of sleep.  I have documented 40-50 emails /phonecalls. Will I only be able to go after them for the $2500 they owe me? Or because of how this is eating me alive can I go for more? I never get angry, very mild mannered, but in the last three weeks I have yelled in anger at several employees at both xwrp and Dodge.  This is clearly having a very negative effect on me"
1026235,BillM,2018-04-12 02:44:00,17367,I'm in agreement with you 100% man.  You shouldn't have to go through all this Bull if you've never had a warranty claim.   Should be a 10min deal. Keep us posted!
1026236,chris.brock,2018-04-12 03:02:00,4053,"$75 to file the claim, you get a pre-trial discussion thing with all parties and a mediator (it's usually solved by then), another $75 if it goes to trial, total $150 but the judge can make the other guys pay that 150. Sure, throw in a figure for stress and aggravation, worse case scenario the judge denies it. I bet they would buckle shortly after you served them the papers."
1026244,DanD,2018-04-12 12:08:00,2223,"I've been dealing with these aftermarket warrantee companies for years. Most all require that proof of maintenance is supplied every three months or 5000k. I usually fax it in for my customers, so they don't forget. I'd be very surprised that its not stated on your contract somewhere. Likely in the most inconspicuous tiny text; mixed in with all the legal Bull. I had one lady's claim declined, on a blown transmission; because the vehicle was 1000klms over the oil change interval. I asked the adjuster what the hell does an engine oil change have to do with the transmission?  His reply was that during the oil change, an issue with the trans could have been seen and prevented it from burning out. It's Bull but that requirement was in the contract, she signed. Dan."
1026249,Rizzo,2018-04-12 12:41:00,4754,"nothing on the contract I signed. I can understand if I wanted warranty work done they would require proof of maintenance, but this is about ""don't use the warranty, you get all your money back"""

1026258,DanD,2018-04-12 13:09:00,2223,"I don't want to argue; but that right there tells me that, that clause must be in the contract somewhere? It may be worded in a way, that it'll take a lawyer to decipher??? If it is and I'm only saying IF it is; then they can claim you're in breach of contract. Dan."

1026270,jimmer,2018-04-12 16:32:00,2730,What the heck do maintenance records have to do with whether you used any of the extended warranty???? What a joke.  I can see why you are so frustrated.

1026272,jimmer,2018-04-12 17:18:00,2730,I didn't think you were defending them. These stories make it tough to put any trust in dealerships and garages though.
1026276,DanD,2018-04-12 18:08:00,2223,"Dealership yes, 75% of the work force are sales people and most of them don't know the difference between a headlight or a tail light. They're there working on commission and are trained on how to sell crap. Independent garages that are not also used car lots, generally are fair (if they are competent to do the repairs); but like in any other service industry; there's always a few bad apples that make us all look bad. Not to brag (yes I am) but I've been in business running my garage for 33 year. There's only the three of us here and we're all licensed. (I trained my two mechanics right from their apprenticeships) I also have an active customer base of over 4800; I'm quite proud of keeping that many customers happy and coming back year after year.
