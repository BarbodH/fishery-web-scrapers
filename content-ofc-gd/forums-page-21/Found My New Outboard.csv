1070524,floater,2021-02-11 21:32:00,220,Holy Crap!! At a weight of 1260 lbs that would sink my 20 foot Whaler!!
1070534,dave524,2021-02-12 10:32:00,4508,Good excuse to get a 420 Outrage¬†ü§£
1070535,Old Ironmaker,2021-02-12 12:33:00,8243,"Yep, might need to add a few layers of plywood to¬†the transom.¬† If they build it they will come as they say. Beats maintaining multiple power plants I would guess. Hey look at me inserting stuff!!!!!"
1070536,Duckie,2021-02-12 13:43:00,305,they wont sell to anyone with over a 4 inch pecker
1070537,AKRISONER,2021-02-12 13:44:00,5558,"those giant boats with 12000000000 horsepower always make me laugh because their top end is rarely over 70mph. Theres a point where the weight and drag/hull design cant gain anymore speed. Hull matters so much more than power once you get going over 70mph. Thats why bullet bass boats will do over 100mph while a ranger struggles to get over 80 with the same motor. Speaking of going fast, wanna see something terrifying? "
1070538,dave524,2021-02-12 15:10:00,4508,Old enough to remember when tournament BASS boats were limited to 150 horse and manufacturers were badging 150's very conservatively for the market. 
1070541,Moosebunk,2021-02-12 15:29:00,3970,Merc dealerships are gonna need bigger garages and taller mechanics.
1070643,Hack_Fisherman,2021-02-19 01:16:00,720,I almost bought one but The wife wouldn‚Äôt let me sell the house
1070648,Dara,2021-02-19 15:05:00,3052,At .4 mpg you would need a 100 gallon tank to get to your cabin 
1070650,grimsbylander,2021-02-19 17:32:00,3016,"Diminishing returns is true for cars as well. It‚Äôs expensive chasing that extra 5mph. Hull design is all about compromise and trading speed for comfort. Guys post those ridiculous ‚Äúmy boat does 80mph loaded and handles 4 footers easily‚Äù lol Bull¬† 	40 years of fishing Gbay, Erie and Ontario... can‚Äôt say I‚Äôve ever seen a Bullet. Allison‚Äôs and Chargers, yes."
1070655,AKRISONER,2021-02-20 00:23:00,5558,"There‚Äôs a guy in my town that actually did a full refurb on a gambler...kinda weird, the guy just left the thing out in shambles, uncovered through the winter, batteries laying in the driveway a stainless prop laying on the ground in his garden. Kinda funny like a hidden gem, I‚Äôd walk by and see the prop and laugh cause if people only knew how much that prop was worth to the right person...anyways I‚Äôd walk past it every day walking my dog and at one point was honestly gathering up the courage to leave a note to the guy saying ‚Äúhey I‚Äôd like to know more about the boat and whether you‚Äôd like me clear up the space in your driveway‚Äù to me if the pro xs on the back ran I could easily sell my skeeter and find myself in a 20 foot gambler with a pro xs and be up money. this plan quickly folded when all of a sudden the console was ripped apart and compartment doors were missing. I wasn‚Äôt sure if he was gutting it or what. But then all of a sudden a ultrex with livescope showed up on the front of it and then all of the compartment doors came back re-carpeted. The guy totally refurbed the thing and it‚Äôs beautiful. Oh well that was the end of my dream lol"
1070658,grimsbylander,2021-02-20 01:23:00,3016,I love the look of the old Gamblers. The sleek nose section jutting out and the low profile console look awesome. Those things can run too!
1070659,AKRISONER,2021-02-20 04:09:00,5558,"To this day, this is the sickest boat I have ever seen   "
1070660,grimsbylander,2021-02-20 04:26:00,3016,Nice. Could land a plane on that front deck.
1070667,AKRISONER,2021-02-20 16:36:00,5558,"You know you have absurd space when you are like, to hell with it, I want to mount the TM straight to reduce air drag hahaha the stance of that boat is just absolutely insane to me. Ahhhh if money was no object eh? Lol"
1070690,grimsbylander,2021-02-21 00:24:00,3016,"Check out the Bassboat Restoration section in that other place I showed you. It's nuts what some guys can do to older boats. I mean, strip them down, separate the top cap right off, and refinish the entire hull's gelcoat including a colour change. It's quite impressive. Do a Gambler search too. "
1070732,Duckie,2021-02-22 15:05:00,305,I bet with that 250HP that boat could get 100 MPH
1070736,AKRISONER,2021-02-22 16:04:00,5558,"nope, they will do 80 comfortably though with a passenger and tournament load. Gambler/Sterling hulls are basically designed to not lose any performance with load. So whether you are by yourself or with your tournament partner and all of your gear you barely lose any speed.¬†There arent too many 100mph hulls on the market. Bullet is the main one, and the ones that get to 100 are strapped with either tuned/modified 250's or 300+ The other company on the up and up is ballistic boats. They now have a standard package boat with a 300 and the owner put a 400 on his."
