1070944,Northerner1212,2021-03-04 01:24:00,23,Thanks for letting me join seem like a great group the question I have is I was reading the regs about ice fishing it says Any 	spring-loaded device which sets the hook for an angler may not be possessed within 30 m of any waters. 	Does this include automatic fisherman and other rod holders that hold the tip down and release when fish strike .? thanks 
1070945,GBW,2021-03-04 01:29:00,8460,The JawJacker is legal.  There are many posts here annually about the matter.  Just look for any key word and you should find it.  This site's been around so long Christ was still a cowboy...
1070946,pics,2021-03-04 01:35:00,1268,Bass pro sells the jaw jacker so I assume you can use it..
1070948,smitty55,2021-03-04 02:30:00,928,So long as it's a loaded rod doing the hookset there is no issue at all.

1070951,Rizzo,2021-03-04 12:58:00,4754,it is the other ones that should be illegal! Quick hookset prevents swallowed bait
1070960,LefroyFisherman,2021-03-04 22:25:00,602,"Wow Rizzo, I never actually figured there was a reason for the automatic hook set stuff til you said that about prevents swallowing the bait, the makes a lot of sense lol! Figured it was lazy fisherman lol"
1070963,Rizzo,2021-03-04 22:42:00,4754,"personally I don't actually think any of 'em should be illegal, but if some kind of tip had to be...I would vote for the one you have to go over and set the hook yourself. I will admit when I was a young lad we would sometimes get distracted (beer involved) and who know how long it was before you noticed the flag up. Good thing pike seem to swim around forever before they swallow it, don't actually remember deep hooking a pike. Largemouth? Different story. I have caught a few bass this winter that have swallowed the bait and I set the hook as quickly as I could get to tip up."
1070964,Fisherman,2021-03-04 23:23:00,7201,First thing you have to look and read.  Are there any springs in/on that product?
1070988,Northerner1212,2021-03-05 17:16:00,23,I was wondering if the consider the rod it’s self as a spring ?
1070989,irishfield,2021-03-05 18:05:00,26272,If it was downrigging would be illegal..
1070993,Fisherman,2021-03-05 22:53:00,7201,"Why, same set up more or less, rod is cranked down to put tension on the line to the release clip."
1070999,irishfield,2021-03-06 03:27:00,26272,Read it in context ! He asked if the automatic fisherman was illegal ...
