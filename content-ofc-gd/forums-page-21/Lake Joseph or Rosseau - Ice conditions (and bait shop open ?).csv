Now to my point, I've been staying home (not at the cottage) just outta respect for the locals ... they dont need my city-boy germs ... ok maybe also because there wasn't much safe ice ... but with our ""lockdown"" soon to be lifted I figured I'd go north and at least shovel off my roof a bit. BUT while I'm there I HAVE to get out on the big lake(s) for some lakers. Would most appreciate any feedback on the conditions (ice/slush/fishin) ... pm's welcome too (and .. does anyone know if Bait on the lake is open ... if not is there somewhere on the way up tha t can sell shiners ? Thanks and tight lines !  "
1070617,lew,2021-02-17 17:37:00,12766,Can't help with your question Jon but good to see your still around and doing well.
1070620,camillj,2021-02-17 18:01:00,1988,"Thanks Lew .. been a LONG time ! Hope you are doing ok as well ! Last time s=we spoke you hung up your legendary musky rods ... have ya had any ""relapses"" ?"
1070621,lew,2021-02-17 18:08:00,12766,No relapses at all Jon and I don't miss it at all. I've had plenty of offers and did go out once for a few hours but the enjoyment wasn't there and I never went again. There's still a small group of us go up to Nippissing every year but now rather than going out fishing we sit on the shore and talk about about it instead LOL
1070622,camillj,2021-02-17 18:41:00,1988,I hear ya Lew ... to be honest .. I'm not sure if you remember but I caught the 'prospecting' bug a number of years ago ... so now I spend at least a 100 hours in the bush looking at rocks for every hour on the boat ... but Im still a dedicated speck chaser ... and I still have the sit out (alone)  in the cold ice fishing sickness too
1070626,Rizzo,2021-02-18 00:38:00,4754,"I had friends on Rosseau a week ago, they said they had around 5 to 6 inches of ice. This was not too far from Windermere. So the ice was decent...but apparently they didn't have any luck with the fishing (were after lakers and walleye)"
1070627,AKRISONER,2021-02-18 03:06:00,5558,I’m guessing there’s plenty of ice to walk on. Might be slushy with all of the snow though
1071240,camillj,2021-03-14 14:57:00,1988,"Thanks Guys .. was up last week and got a couple small ones ... Ice was great .. about 12"" ... not sure now after that big thaw now though"
