All were tight to the bottom. Was fishing a mud/muscle bed .PROBLEM, herring were quicker then the whities at snatching up the midge. Was tempted to retie without the drop,but I was having fun, and thought,one of those whities might beat them to it. Well that didn't happen,but another tie that has proven it works. Arsenal is growing. Grubs,worms,shrimp and now midge.     Edit to add  Stoked that my boy is kicking it with my ties as well.  "
