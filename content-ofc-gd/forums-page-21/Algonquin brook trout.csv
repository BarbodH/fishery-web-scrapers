1070779,Ken L,2021-02-25 21:12:00,1,Looking for a spring canoe loop in Algonquin park.  Like to spend 2 days getting into park. 2 days to fish. Then leave. focus is on brook trout. appreciate any help.
1070785,glen,2021-02-26 15:59:00,2641,Who wouldn’t want to do that trip.  But the level of comfort stops me.  I just can’t get enough gear in a canoe.   	anyway your probably going to just pick a route that looks good and go.  People don’t give the Brookie spots out to easy.

1070815,Dozer,2021-02-28 02:37:00,896,"They associate with well oxygenated, fast moving water in Spring.  Bigger fish will have the prime spots.  You might be surprised at how shallow you get them.  Not to say you can't catch them anywhere else.  Follow BillM's advice, har dto do for a 2 day loop but best of luck."

In the spring, you WILL experience black flies, in numbers that have to be experienced to be believed. Good luck. Doug"
