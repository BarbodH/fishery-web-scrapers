1070710,Sinker,2021-02-21 20:46:00,8692,"You should make some wire worms. Whities chow them down. I've never tried them on simcoe, just don't have to, they are the dumbest fish in the province LOL.....perch love em too.  Lori and I had our 4 whities in 12 mins on tuesday last week. Fished 1130-2 and put 10 or so on the ice. Slept in, and got home for dinner. Great day. Headed out again tomorrow.  S."
1070713,AKRISONER,2021-02-21 21:23:00,5558,"I really need to add the Cheater as part of my arsenal. It just makes so much sense when jigging deep fish, especially fish like laketrout that can be anywhere in the column"
1070714,Moosebunk,2021-02-21 21:47:00,3970,"So essentially it looks like maybe a little red marabou tail, red thread and the clear wrap?  I like this tie Brian, did up some bloodworms when learning back in the early 2000's but none as durable looking as that, and mine were without the little bou tail that likely comes to life down there.  Nicely done!"
1070720,misfish,2021-02-21 23:03:00,29133,"My spots are limited as a walker and with a knee that feels like it wants to break off, my spots are limited Shane . Lucky for me,I have learned over the past few years, some shallow spots that the whities hang.  I was sitting over 22 fow. I have some tied copper wire with red beads . Thanks Drew I use red mallard and rabbit zonker for the body and tails, and yes, they flair out really nice just sitting still. I tie a brown grub that has worked as well . Looks like a fresh water shrimp. If I could keep the herring off while the whities are with them, that would be a bonus. Those buggers grab it so fast. I will take a picture later this week to show how nice they look in the water. The ribbing and UV resin, does add durability, and you are very close with the tie.  Thanks again B"
1070750,Sinker,2021-02-24 14:56:00,8692,"We were fishing 25ft. I don't go deeper than 40ft anymore for anything in that lake. Lost a laker monday, but they have been kind of scarce for us. S."
1070754,misfish,2021-02-24 16:38:00,29133,On a shoal ?
1070759,Sinker,2021-02-24 19:14:00,8692,"No, just off shore in the rocks. S."
1070760,akaShag,2021-02-24 21:26:00,2073,I sure miss fishing Simcoe!!!!!
1070761,misfish,2021-02-24 21:53:00,29133,"Just like me . I have to admit though,I have been having some luck in the mud bottom. Probly why the worm is working for me ."
1070762,RickOnt,2021-02-24 21:56:00,669,Hi B That tie on the high hook is very impressive and it works!! Got to Simcoe last week for a couple feeds of Perch. Have not ben out for the Whities yet but will. Cheers Rick .
1070763,misfish,2021-02-24 22:52:00,29133,"Hey Ric, thanks bud. Good to hear from ya . My ole haunt is still not producing like it use too, so been going back in time sorta speak . Remember that spot where I was getting herring the same size as the whities ? Well , been fishing that area again . They be there bud ."
1070766,PUMP KNOWS,2021-02-25 01:01:00,937,Sweet!  What are you I’m using for the bottom bait?  Have you noticed more interests on the blood worm fly? I recently just added the Raven worm in red to my arsenal.  I thought of using that to a drop shot for skittish fish
1070773,misfish,2021-02-25 10:07:00,29133,"All the normal stuff . Meegs,vibrado and williams , a couple of my own tied jigs . They all stir the bottom up ."
