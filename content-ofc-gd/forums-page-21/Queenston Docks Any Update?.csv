1070280,antonio77,2021-02-03 21:14:00,32,Hello everyone  Does anybody know if they are still closed? Can't find anything online. Thank you
1070282,Alumacraft,2021-02-03 22:23:00,139,I went for a drive a week ago for a look and it was still closed. I don't think anything has changed I'm local and I haven't heard anything about it opening up. I'm pretty sure that the upper launch ramps are still open but don't quote me on this one. I didn't drive up there for a look.
1070339,antonio77,2021-02-05 14:26:00,32,Thanks ;) Looks like no fishing in the area at all.
1070376,Steve Piggott,2021-02-06 14:45:00,196,Drove by yesterday still closed 
1070442,antonio77,2021-02-08 16:00:00,32,Thanks Steve! So frustrating about that closing. Everyone is keeping the distance and still... not allowed to enjoy the fishing
1070443,Rizzo,2021-02-08 16:04:00,4754,oh yes those 30 lb barricades would most certainly keep me outü§´
1070479,Pigeontroller,2021-02-09 20:38:00,2793,I bet hand cuffs and the back seat of an Niagara Regional Police cruiser would though!

1070483,misfish,2021-02-09 22:31:00,29133,Crank it.LOL
1070633,antonio77,2021-02-18 15:25:00,32,morning everyone any news on this one? Did they open or still restricted?
1070689,fishdawg,2021-02-21 00:00:00,912,I heard from a good source early April after the pay meters are installed. I dont mind the pay meters.¬† But to keep them closed now is beyond ridiculous.
