1071161,GBW,2021-03-12 02:03:00,8460,"Hey all. So there might be a store closing close to me. What would you pay for all the fishing items in the pic? Baits, scent, lures, line and rod rack. Not my place. I am thinking of making an offer to buy the fishing gear is all "
1071168,Big Cliff,2021-03-12 07:47:00,6899,"That would really depend on what you are going to do with it, if all it's going to do is collect dust then why buy it at all? If you are thinking of re-selling it then is the potential profit worth the time and effort? Is there enough stuff in there that you are going to use and really need to justify buying a bunchÂ of stuff you might never use?....... Many questions would need to be answered before I would consider what it's value would be to me."
1071170,Old Ironmaker,2021-03-12 10:43:00,8243,"WhatÂ I would pay would depend onÂ what's on the shelf and as Big Cliff said what you plan on doing with it, use it, sell it or watch it gather dust, simple as that. Are they Rappalla's or Chinese knock offs? Etc. etc. Regarless no morfe than 15% of retail price. I would pick through it 1st then sell the balance. DO NOT open the packages."
1071177,LostAnotherOne,2021-03-12 13:32:00,956,If it was me I would offer him $50 for the line and weights and see what he says. Â LooksÂ like there are a few more spools on the bottom left of the board.
1071178,glen,2021-03-12 13:41:00,2641,$300 and remove all and leave the space clean
1071185,Headhunter,2021-03-12 16:47:00,5703,Hoe much are they willing to pay you to store all that stuff? How long has it been hanging there? Is the line even usable at this point? These are questions I would be asking. HH
1071188,BillM,2021-03-12 18:11:00,17367,How much of that stuff is actually going to be useful for you?
1071190,OhioFisherman,2021-03-12 19:43:00,6623,This! You can fill a barn with stuff you will never use.
1071203,GBW,2021-03-13 01:31:00,8460,"My thought was buy the lot at a bulk discount (with luck) and sell the items I won't use (or kids derby donations), such as that line.Â  But they have lost my interest by resoponding to others and ignoring my MSG's and public posts asking for info.Â  So now I am not willing to help him make a buck and me save a buck.Â  Thanks all."
1071210,Rizzo,2021-03-13 13:38:00,4754,the most desirable things in that picture are a Dr. Pepper and the chicken carcass in the bottom left corner of fridge.
1071219,Big Cliff,2021-03-13 15:48:00,6899,"I really think thats a smart move on your part, a lot of that stuff looks like low end and you would have a hard time getting rid of it at almost any price. I have a box full of stuff that I bought over the years because the price was right, much of it has never even seen water but I might use it some day ðŸ˜Š"
