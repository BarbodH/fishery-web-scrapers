1071425,gordy28,2021-03-21 23:46:00,638,My group had the experience of booking a trip in August 2019 for August 2020 Needless to say what we thought we were doing and what we ended up doing were two different things Yet this trip was one of my favorites - mainly because we ended up going (at a few points we were sure it wasn't going to happen) and because once at the outpost life felt relatively normal With much of Canada still being in various stages of lockdown I thought it may be helpful to share how we managed it https://www.northernjacks.com/post/planning-your-fishing-trip-during-the-pandemic Cheers Andrew
