1070629,smitty55,2021-02-18 04:54:00,928,"I wasn't going to bother commenting but when it was called a Laker I just had to lol. The one main characteristic that separates Greys from other trout and hybrids is the much deeper forked tail, which that fish does not have. Nor does is have a true enough square tail to be a Speck so my vote is Splake.Â  Looks just like these and plenty of other pics I've seem guys post on some fb fishing groups I'm on. "
1070631,Old Man,2021-02-18 14:32:00,822,Tail makes itÂ lookÂ like aÂ Splake to me.  Edit: Didnâ€™t realize it was a Zombie post. I really have to start checking the date.
1070632,Sinker,2021-02-18 14:37:00,8692,"Ok, so all you guys saying splake, you realize splake are sterile, and don't reproduce, right? Where would this fish come from? Its clearly not very old. I don't see anything pointing to speck at all. No red spots, no blue halos, no square tail. Hence, the reasoning it is a laker. It has many laker characteristics, and came from a body of water with natural lakers. I find this stuff interesting, but to say its a splake makes no sense to me. Where did it come from? S."
1070634,Spiel,2021-02-18 15:43:00,9065,100% Brookie and it certainly appears to be a hatchery raised fish.
1070636,dave524,2021-02-18 18:31:00,4508,"a dozen or so years ago this fish was lifted on the Credit, several AutumnsÂ in a row, has to be a Laker cause we all know there are no Specs in Lake Ontario "
1070637,craigdritchie,2021-02-18 19:56:00,1586,"About five years ago I was at the Old Mill Dam in Toronto shooting photos of jumping salmon. A day or two later I noticed a small fish in the background of one of the photos, so I cropped in as much as I could to see what it was. To my shock, it was a brook trout.   Picture quality is horrible because it's enlarged like crazy, but it's still unmistakably a brookie. No doubt about it. If they show up in Lake Ontario tributaries, then why not Georgian Bay?  "
1070638,akaShag,2021-02-18 20:45:00,2073,"Bear Creek is a tributary stream of the Pine River, which is a tributary of the Nottawasaga, which empties into Georgian Bay.Â  Bear Creek did have a natural brook trout population, don't know if that is still the case.Â  There were also brookies in some of the streams on the Bruce Peninsula, flowing into the Pottawatomi and Sydenham Rivers, which flow into Georgian Bay via Owen Sound.Â  That was back in the 80s, I have no idea if there are still specks back there or not.  And I'm not that sure how to spell the full name of the Pot. ðŸ˜‰ Doug"
1070640,porkpie,2021-02-18 21:39:00,2521,"Holy Necro post. Â Anyway, could you catch an adventurous brookie in Georgian Bay? Â Of course you could. Â Many of the streams feeding tributaries of Georgian Bay are littered with brookies. Â The bay is also littered with lakers. Â A splake? Â I havenâ€™t caught one up there since probably 2001. Â Back in the 90â€™s youâ€™d catch them pretty regularly to the point it was sometimes a nuisance In the fall Â because the float would drop and youâ€™d be hoping for a bow and it would be a splake. Â So I doubt this very old post is a pic of a splake. Â Anyway, my 2 cents."
1070641,Fisherman,2021-02-18 22:00:00,7201,"A number of years ago, 5 or so, they were still catching them in the small pools just beside the north impact area."
1070642,misfish,2021-02-18 22:12:00,29133,"Yes, have caught them in Bear. As recent as last year. They are not really big, but if there are small ones,there has to be a few big ones ."
1070672,Sinker,2021-02-20 17:42:00,8692,"I never doubted you could catch a speck there, and if that was a speck i wouldn't be surprised, but its a laker.Â  Show me one key ID feature of a speck on that fish....??  S."
1070673,smitty55,2021-02-20 17:52:00,928,I've caught more Lakers than all other trout combined and I've never seen one ever that had a tail like that with so little fork in the tail. Hence why I say it's not a Laker. 
1070674,porkpie,2021-02-20 17:54:00,2521,?? Â I donâ€™t know what it is man. Â Just saying itâ€™s probably not a splake. Happy Saturday!

1070679,Sinker,2021-02-20 20:01:00,8692,"Sorry, not directed at you, personally....lol. "
1070680,Sinker,2021-02-20 20:03:00,8692,"Ok, so what speck features do you see? I see a lot more laker than speck. I don't see any speck at all. No square tail, no red spots, no blue halos, no black mouth.....?? Looks like a stocked laker thats been in a pen for a while and rounded off its tail to me.  S."
1070681,Sinker,2021-02-20 20:04:00,8692,"Beleive me, I've caught tons of lakers, and specks. TONS. Why do you think thats a speck? It doesn't even have a square tail. No spots, no halos, no black mouth. I'm not arguing, just find it weird that everyone says speck, when its nothing like a speck to me. S."

1070686,dave524,2021-02-20 21:38:00,4508,"Caught all 4 too, Lakers both L. Ontario and the Haliburton strain , even a difference there. Lots of Specs and when the stocking programs in HaliburtonÂ went to Splake, them too, during the change, both in the same lake at times, even a ton of those Laker backcross Splake in the Bighead and Beaver during the 80's/90's. The tail doesn't look perfectly square drooped over the rock but isn't near as forked as a full blooded Laker and I find most Lakers have a somewhat laterally compressedÂ head compared to a Spec and the jawline does extend as far back as a Laker, Lakers have a pretty big yap on them compared to a Spec. Doesn't look Laker to me, early spring Specs are not nearly as colourful as later."
1070697,smitty55,2021-02-21 03:55:00,928,"Sinker there's an awful lot of variation among Splake, they can look more like Specks or more like Lakers or a combination of both. None of them have a forked tail like a Laker. Also male and female look different and the age of the fish makes a difference as well. I agree that's not a Speck or a Laker, which is why I say Splake."
1070709,Sinker,2021-02-21 20:43:00,8692,"So, where did the splake come from? They haven't been stocked in there for decades.  Its a laker boys. A young one.  S."
1070727,Chuck Enwinde,2021-02-22 12:06:00,247,"Splake can occur in the wild just like tiger trout or tiger muskies.Â  They are infertile so the don't propagate but they can occur. As for the fish pictured - my guess is a female spring brook trout.Â  TheyÂ hardly have any markings a lot of the time, and they have that little crease in the middle of the tail that can make it lookÂ slightly forked.  Here'sÂ a big female from last spring.  "
1070729,Fisherman,2021-02-22 13:58:00,7201,"What is it,Â  a frankenstein of human meddling by no other words."
1070731,Spiel,2021-02-22 14:48:00,9065,The markings in the tail and dorsal fin don't agree with your assessment. 	Also juvenile Lake Trout have a very noticeable forked tail.
698653,GreenCanada,2012-05-22 20:17:00,375,"I need some help identifying this trout. I was out shore fishing Georgian Bay this past weekend and happened to land this nice 13"" brook trout. I was kind of surprised as I was expecting a rainbow or maybe a small laker.  Now I'm not too sure if it's a speck or a splake. If you could offer your expertise it would be greatly appreciated!  "
698657,Fishing yoda,2012-05-22 20:34:00,29,"looks to me like a splake.. the colors and the square tail leed me to believe what you got there was a splake, now mind you some brookies aren't very colorfull but at a first glance looks like it to me."
698661,jigsnreels,2012-05-22 20:40:00,133,I thought a brookie had more of a square tail than a splake...
698769,GreenCanada,2012-05-23 01:37:00,375,"A higher resolution photo    My vote is for speck, but I haven't heard of anyone catching a speck in Georgian Bay before...  hmmm"
698772,Gregoire,2012-05-23 01:42:00,1397,Looks like a brookie to me.
698781,Joeytier,2012-05-23 01:55:00,3990,"The slight forked tail and all-white spots make me think splake, but their snouts usually aren't so stout.  I believe Gbay splake stocking ended a very long time ago, but apparently they will successfully spawn on the odd occassion.  I believe it's a splake."
698788,northernpike56,2012-05-23 02:01:00,717,Looks like a brookie to me.
698817,dave524,2012-05-23 02:56:00,4508," The splake that were stocked in Georgian Bay last were the laker backcross splake, splake X laker, definitely not one of them, they were quite laker like in appearance. I would say a lake run spec."

698927,Christopheraaron,2012-05-23 13:50:00,3525, Another nickname for a brookie is squaretail.

Can't really go by the spots, as there seem to be several different variants."
698936,johnnyb,2012-05-23 14:18:00,3413,When in doubt......Atlantic
698938,wallacio,2012-05-23 14:24:00,475, Correct.   Splake backcross stocking in Huron/GB stopped in 1995 which is well before the life span of the fish in the OP's picture.   Currently Splake are only stocked in inland lakes in Ontario.

699041,GreenCanada,2012-05-23 21:24:00,375, That's some really interesting information.
699111,camillj,2012-05-24 02:06:00,1988,Id actually say laker
699118,danc,2012-05-24 02:22:00,4677,"I can definately see a couple of red specks amongst the spots on the side, so there is some Brook Trout in there for sure. The thing that throws me off is the pale fins and the rouded edges on the tips of tail. I've caught my share of May coaster Brook Trout that look just like that. Very silver and pale. But it seems to me that the fins should have more color in them and a more pronounced leading white edge."
699139,GreenCanada,2012-05-24 05:27:00,375,"There is definitely some Brook Trout in it, in my opinion. Blackened mouth, both internally and along the lips. White leading edge on fins, with red specks and blue halos.  It really is one of the more interesting specimens that I have caught.  My thought is still more Brookie than Laker, but most likely it's a hybrid of some sort.  Anyone ever catch a Brook Trout in Georgian Bay?"
699171,wallacio,2012-05-24 11:56:00,475,I caught this one in a GB tributary while targetting Steelhead.   I can't say with absolute certainty as it was caught in a tributary that does hold resident Brookies but it was also likely a lake-run fish given it's appearance (washed out colours)...very similar to your fish.  
699176,Spiel,2012-05-24 12:04:00,9065," I've caught lots of spring resis Wallico that resembled yours in colour that also had the apparent black grubs, I'd guess thats a resi too and a big one!  I think the first fish pic in question is a Brookie though, but it looks like some sort of hatchery or net escapee."
699189,dave524,2012-05-24 12:34:00,4508," There is a least 1 male brookie that has been lifted in the fall in the cage on the Credit on muliple occasions, being fall the pics I saw his colour was very intense though. There are a few lake run brookies around."
1070599,Barry Willis,2021-02-16 21:59:00,180,"That is not a speck. SpecksÂ have a square tail as well as halos around their spots especially on their back.Â This fish has a slightly forked tail. A lake trout has more of a forked tail than this fish.Â It's a splake. I have been fishing for them regularly and successfullyÂ since the 70's. Regardless, nice fish."
1070607,Dara,2021-02-17 00:30:00,3052,"From what I have read, there is no way to tell if a fish is a splake or not by outward appearance. You need a scientific knowledge of anatomy and a sharp knife.  A few years back I was fishing a splake lake between Christmas and new year day when trout season opens, but splake is year round. We caught a fish and couldn't be sure if it was splake or spec so we released it  After this I researched a bit and found that it is impossible to determine even for a CO. Thus,if a lake has been stocked with splake, all trout in that lake are specs and you can't be charged for OOS fish"
1070610,BillM,2021-02-17 03:35:00,17367,Let's hope in almost 10 years since this thread was started we've come to the conclusion that this in fact is an Atlantic.
1070611,Terry,2021-02-17 12:28:00,14456,Greencanada has beÂ on this forum since 2014. So Iâ€™m pretty sure heâ€™s not going to give a damn what kind of fish it was at this point
1070619,Sinker,2021-02-17 17:44:00,8692,"Me too. I dont see any speck in there at all. Pure laker. Makes sense where it was caught too. If that was a coaster brookie, you wouldn't have to wonder what it is, you would know right away. S."
