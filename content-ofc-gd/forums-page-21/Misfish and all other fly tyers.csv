1070769,Fang,2021-02-25 01:28:00,1330,"The bottom looks like natural hair but the top two looks synthetic, reminds me of polar fur/ hairÂ or some name similar.Â Still great stuff for streamers and walleye jigs"
1070774,misfish,2021-02-25 11:03:00,29133,I double checked and it is Icelandic sheep.
1070777,misfish,2021-02-25 17:25:00,29133,
1070778,dave524,2021-02-25 18:02:00,4508,"I tied a bunch of smaller streamers with calf or kip tail, looked similar."
1070780,Gil Levesque,2021-02-26 01:46:00,103,"All are natursl hair! Note skinÂ patch attached! Whatever it is, im gonna tie up some pike flies with it! Or at least try to !"
1070818,Dara,2021-02-28 03:59:00,3052,My wife makes me socks from Icelandic sheep wool. Could try that
1070820,singingdog,2021-02-28 12:23:00,1047,The top 2 look like Icelandic sheep wool: very kinky. I have never seen Icelandic sheep wool as straight as the bottom one. The sheep wool is great for long streamers. You can get away with very small amounts of it as it 'breathes' a lot in the water.
1070840,Gil Levesque,2021-03-01 00:01:00,103,Thanx all! Cheers!
