Also don’t feel so crazy spending this off season researching as much as I have been, clearly it pays off.  Great read as always ! @Moosebunk"
1070724,mepps,2021-02-22 02:21:00,1301,"Another great read, glad I got to be part of this ongoing journey! Here's top all the big fish yet you  come!"
1070725,Bill,2021-02-22 02:21:00,140,Enjoyed reading this. Thanks.
1070728,Rizzo,2021-02-22 13:34:00,4754,some great fish pics! Pretty sure I bumped into you at Petit Dragon that year you went to L St C the first time

1070733,mamona,2021-02-22 15:14:00,597,"Another inspiring article. I truly appreciated ""lessons learned"" section."
1070735,glen,2021-02-22 15:28:00,2641,Great read as always.  It’s fun to see how big a fish you can catch.  Sometimes you see one in the water that is bigger then any you have landed.  But one of my favourite Andy sayings is “they are all good fish. “
1070738,JoshS,2021-02-22 18:47:00,729,Sweet write up. Got through a bit and looking forward to the rest. Thanks for sharing and all the detail. Good luck 2021!
1070755,Moosebunk,2021-02-24 16:55:00,3970,"Quite possible. That is where Andy and I stayed both times.  Well, he certainly didn't want his photo taken with anything less than a giant... or have his photo taken at all for that matter.  Hard to know for sure how he feels about sizes but one thing is for certain, he loves the muskie game.  Thanks for reading fellas."
