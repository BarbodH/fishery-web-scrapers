I donâ€™t know anything about it except itÂ appears to be a salt water type of reel. Â Wondering what I can do with it.Â  https://m.tackledirect.com/penn-purii6000-pursuit-ii-spinning-reel.html Do you guys think it would be up to the task for muskieÂ or Great lakes salmon? It just looks too big for pike and bass. "
