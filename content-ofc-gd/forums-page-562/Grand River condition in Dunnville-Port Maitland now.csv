563175,Live2fish85,2011-03-18 22:12:00,1633,You can catch a bunch in there in there early spring but I was at the lake today and when I went over the Grand River the water is still high the ice has mostly cleared from what I seen but not great conditions for fishing so I'm going to my local spot out there for some fishing. I would say another week or 2 and you will be good. But make sure of the regulations because the Conservations Officer's are down there often and you don't want to get caught fishing out of season. But the catfish will be in soon and there good to catch also at this time of year they are great to eat.
