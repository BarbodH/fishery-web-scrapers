562183,msp,2011-03-16 00:34:00,1336,Im not talking about getting rid of my fishing partner....... Just wondering if anyone has any recomendations on a product that can remove the nasty film that has encrusted itself at the waterline of my boat. A pressure washer and elbow grease just wont cut it. Thanks for the imput.
562191,Guest gbfisher,2011-03-16 00:45:00,0,Elbo grease. Vim or muratic acid. Most places use muratic acid to clean that hard to get off scum from your hull.
562197,irishfield,2011-03-16 00:50:00,26272,"What he said.. I always had good luck with Starbrite hull cleaner on my painted aluminum boats. I'd pull the boat out in Temagami.. spray it off in Sundridge to get the major stuff and then when I got around to it spray the hull down with Starbrite and hit it with the hose here at home. The starbrite eats the algae and the hose keeps it from eating into your paint!  Last fall I scrubbed the boat immediately, with a bent head sponge floor mop, as it was pulled out of the water (after 5 months in the lake). It's as clean as it's ever been, so once you get it clean it's a lot easier to just keep it that way by scrubbing it immediately when wet."

562235,dhickey,2011-03-16 02:22:00,1038,be careful with the acid. it can go bad real quick. get your mixture rite!! have lots of water on hand/hose is good /have a freind with you if you have never used acid before. just a word of caution.

562553,msp,2011-03-17 00:15:00,1336,Good tips. I will look for Starbrite. I will probably stay away from the acid. thanks Guys!
562558,danbouck,2011-03-17 00:30:00,4380,"Starbrite is Oxalic Acid and Ethylene Glycol. Don't breath it in but like others say, everything melts off."

562567,Bernie,2011-03-17 00:50:00,3190,I prefer Slimy-Grimy to Starbrite. Comes in a powder. Mix it in a pressurized spray can.
562583,FishAbout,2011-03-17 01:41:00,106,We use slimy grimy where I work and it works great.  Just don't miss a spot when spraying it on or it will leave runs.  Spose to be safe for the environment.
562586,GBW,2011-03-17 01:47:00,8460,spray-9 for everything else.
