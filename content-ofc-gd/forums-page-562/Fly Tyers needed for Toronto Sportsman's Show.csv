560419,thatleetboy,2011-03-10 22:53:00,143,"I have volunteered to do a couple of shifts at the Toronto Sportsman's Show. There will be an area where Trout Unlimited is teaching kids how to tie flies...  I know that Bill Christmas is still looking to see if he can find a few warm bodies to help teach the kids. If you've got a couple of extra hours, it will get you free admission to the show once your teaching shift is over.  I don't think you have to be a master tyer to do this... hey, they're taking me. I believe the fly that is being taught is a woolly worm.  If you want to get in touch with Bill and see if you can help, either contact him directly, or send me a PM or email, and I will put you in touch with him directly.   Cheers"

If you want, you can read my post about it here...   Best of all, I met some experienced anglers who promised to take me fly fishing!    (cuz I really need the help...)"
563108,thatleetboy,2011-03-18 19:42:00,143,  That is so cool!
563170,Billy Bob,2011-03-18 22:08:00,5865,"If ""jig tying"" were also being taught and I was much closer I would do it in a heart beat....we need to keep our youth interested in the Great Outdoors (and I don't mean the movie).....you never know what will trigger a kid's attention to get involved.  Come on guys....time to belly up to the bar.... Bob"
