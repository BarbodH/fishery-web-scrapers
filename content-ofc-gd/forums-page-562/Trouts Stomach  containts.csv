562268,Skud,2011-03-16 03:33:00,739,Don't know if this has come up before but the trout I caught today had gobies in it. Has anyone seen this before?  
562269,irishfield,2011-03-16 03:34:00,26272,Sure it's not a Sculpin??
562270,camillj,2011-03-16 03:37:00,1988,mmmmmmm .... sculpinnnnnn ...

562281,MillerPhoto,2011-03-16 03:56:00,147,"Sculpin have a wider more broad head with their eyes more on top of their head. The one in the above photo has a narrow head, eyes more on the side, also a vary narrow mouth. I would bet its a Round Goby."
562290,richyb,2011-03-16 04:11:00,774,The way to tell between a goby and a sculpin is the pectoral fins ... a goby is joined at the bottom as one single fin... a sculpin had 2 seperate fins ... Fishing off of oro line 9 this year I found a dozen or so gobies in the whitefish I caught. First I have ever seen of them in simcoe.
562295,OhioFisherman,2011-03-16 04:41:00,6623,"Big fish eat little fish, they aren`t real selective, if it`s an easy meal chances are it`s gone. Most of those appear to be what we call lake or emerald shiners here. The one in the middle does appear to be a gobie, but could be a sculpin. I have caught steel head with shad, perch, emerald shiners in their bellies here, and sometimes one heck of a lot of them."
562323,12footspringbok,2011-03-16 11:21:00,459,Had a few lakers on simcoe spitting up gobies this year and cleaned a few whities with them in their stomachs too.  So i decided to try and make a goby imitator only tried it two days and it will need some more work but it produced.... 
562376,tonyb,2011-03-16 14:23:00,1637,"Yes, Gobies have been in Lake Simcoe for a couple of years now.  Clearly, the attempt to eradicate them with the use of Rotenone a couple of years ago has failed, as expected.  On a positive note, the Round Goby has directly contributed to the world class Smallmouth Bass fishery on Lake Erie.  Lake Simcoe fish species will certainly capitalize on this new food source in the same way, at the expense of introducing higher levels of contaminants into fish up the food chain.  The reason why...Round Gobies will consume Zebra Mussels, and Zebra Mussels are filter feeders constantly consuming and storing contaminants.  Everything is connected  Tony  P.S. Sculpins are a pretty rare catch as they are not aggressive like Gobies, but here is a way to tell them apart.  "
562381,fishrking,2011-03-16 14:58:00,24,On georgain bay we had an extremely serious baitfish crash a few years back.  I believe one of the saviors for many of the sportfish was the round goby.  I've caught everything from steelhead to whitefish and lakers that were stuffed with gobies.
562383,DoubleDigits,2011-03-16 15:03:00,140," I recently read an interesting article on In-Fisherman that suggests that while the gobies have fattened mature fish, overall, numbers are way down. http://www.in-fisherman.com/content/state-smallmouth/3  I'm not an Erie bass fisherman, so I don't know either way.

562408,uglyfish,2011-03-16 16:32:00,981,"Still plenty of smallies in lake erie, both big and small!"
562415,tonyb,2011-03-16 16:50:00,1637," Interesting read, thanks for that.  This is the problem with invasive species, there is no roadmap or risk analysis that can be used to determine the future impact on the fishery.  All we can do, is go with the flow, and capitalize on fisheries that benefit from invasives before they crash (or not?)  Tony"
562492,misfish,2011-03-16 20:18:00,29133,Did ya fry up the smelts?  Sculpins Doug.  I asked pretty much the same question acouple years back.
562615,BassAsin,2011-03-17 06:08:00,806,"we dont have the Gobie problem up north here YET   so i dont know, but do ya have a pic of that there trout ya caught?"
562617,Roy,2011-03-17 09:57:00,13728, I believe that that would be Skud's entry in the Team #9 NGL trout category. A fine fish indeed.
562628,Harrison,2011-03-17 11:32:00,2202,I have to stop getting so excited when I see these titles from Simcoe fish. I have to acccept I am probably not going to get my original wedding ring back.
562630,steverowbotham,2011-03-17 11:52:00,1800,"I caught a bunch on Simcoe this year with gobies, they're definitely in there good now and the fish are taking advantage!"
562644,The Urban Fisherman,2011-03-17 12:52:00,2050,"guaranteed they'll eat gobies! I've caught Steelhead on a piece of half rotten shrimp taken out of a $2.99 shrimp ring... I'm betting a swimming goby looks a little more tasty!  They look a lot like the sculpins I used to catch as a kid on Manitoulin Island tribs...  those same tribs were loaded with Raibows who were surely eating the sculpins, also bottom dwelling fish like gobies..."
562679,timmeh,2011-03-17 15:05:00,609," Thanks for posting this. I've always kind of wondered if this could happen. Of course those fish that were already mature when the gobies really took off fluorished. But future recruitment is a different story. Are we going to see a crash in smallie populations in areas like Erie and Simcoe? Fishing is so good now no one would believe it, but the same could be said prior to the crash of many fisheries, including great lakes salmon.  Maybe at least this should be a nudge that we need to ensure we're protecting spawning fish to make sure they can guard the nests."
562874,daryl0815,2011-03-18 01:29:00,225,"I would say its a goby, but I am no expert.  The gobies are definitely here to stay, so I am glad that other fish are eating them.  I work at the nuke plant, and you should see the goby that got caught in the intake screen, it measured 15 inches long! and almost a pound I would say, crazy to see..."
