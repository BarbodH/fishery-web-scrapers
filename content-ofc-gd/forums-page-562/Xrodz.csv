After lots of research, learning Sage no longer makes its 3113M CP, not wanting a GLX 3 Power and for something nicer than a Lamiglas X113, I came across many positive discussions about Xrodz.  Xrodz  I am very interested in their 13 foot centerpin rod, but finding reviews has been tough online. Anyone here ever fish these rods? They are made by Jim Mercier formerly Fetha Styx.  This rod has a carbon fiber rear end, counter balanced with a Alps triangle reel seat and a 10‚Äù Eva front end covered with Shark Skin. The guides are TICH plated 316 stainless steel with zirconium rings. There are 4 double foot guides then the remaining 10 are single foot guides of the same material.  Thanks,  -j"
