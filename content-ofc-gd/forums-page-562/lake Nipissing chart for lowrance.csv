563184,aplumma,2011-03-18 22:37:00,6896,I am looking to see if someone can give a review on the current version and if they recommend it. I know Bernie has in the past said the accuracy is poor on some of the versions. If you can add which version/year  or other info it would helpful  thanks  Art
563275,Nipfisher,2011-03-19 02:08:00,2449,"Art, I have the Navionics Lake Maps HotMaps Platinum Canada ""C"" from 2009 I believe. It is a micro sd card and it says MSD/HMPT - C6 VO1.22 Not sure if that helps you but I do know that Lake Nipissing is not one of the featured lakes on it. I have found some errors on it including an entire island missing in Callander Bay.  To be honest I really had no clue how to use the HDS last season but I think I figured it out this winter. I'll practice a bit more and test it on a few trips down the French River and into the West Arm this summer."
563293,Bernie,2011-03-19 03:01:00,3190,Is it possible to load Mapsource to a Lowrance? I have the Mapsource Lake Nipissing chart loaded on a hand held Garmin Rino and it's the same Lake Nipissing map I have on the cottage wall. It's right on the money and shows everything the way it should be. I'm seriously considering dumping the Lowrance for a Garmin.
563357,Rich Clemens,2011-03-19 15:01:00,3131,"Art.  I too have the Navionics HotMaps Premium. MSD/PREM E6  Vol 1.22 Mine is from 2007.  I pretty much use it for Navigation purposes only.  I do use it to know about where shallower areas are and in somewhat handy last year up at Lakair.  Couple errors I found - like markers the wrong color.  Thought about getting a newer version, but the recent additions would not help much in the areas I fish up that way.   I have an old version of Map Create for Canada, that I made some maps from.  Although this only shows shoreline contours - no depths and such.  Again, primarily for navigation on unmapped waters - which the French River has not been mapped.  Not sure I helped ya much, but this is what I have and how I use it.  See you guys in a few months - coming in late Friday afternoon."
