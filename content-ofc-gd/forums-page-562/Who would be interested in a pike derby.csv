563065,oldphart,2011-03-18 17:57:00,665,"~~~~Note to self, Turn off the Alarm Clock, next year guys"
563077,misfish,2011-03-18 18:29:00,29133,Sry about that OP.
563090,Billy Bob,2011-03-18 19:04:00,5865, There's always take out.....JUST KIDDING....
563092,irishfield,2011-03-18 19:10:00,26272,LOL Bob.. haven't gone there in 30 years.. no point ordering now.
563095,Billy Bob,2011-03-18 19:13:00,5865, You just don't like Tipping....(heard through the grape vine)...
563118,Terry,2011-03-18 20:12:00,14456,DAMN
563182,Cudz,2011-03-18 22:35:00,2652,Too bad.  Was looking forward to it.
563198,misfish,2011-03-18 22:58:00,29133,Sorry again guys.Feel like a real heel pumping this up and it turned out to be a no go.
563199,asdve23rveavwa,2011-03-18 23:02:00,2690," Don't sweat it, man!!  This time of year the ice is so dicey anywhere south, it's a crapshoot."
563211,Cudz,2011-03-18 23:32:00,2652,"That is not your fault.  I thought the shoreline would stay too but yesterday and last night was too warm.  No biggie, now if this ice can melt really really fast we might be able to get some pike fishing from the boat before the end of the month rolls around.   well not likely but it would be nice."
563289,skeeter,2011-03-19 02:40:00,1907,Damn. Daniel and I were really looking forward to it.. Oh well crap happens. I guess we wouldnt want to run behind a factory and grab a few skids to throw down on the 4 feet of open water????? Just an idea.
563291,dhickey,2011-03-19 02:47:00,1038,sunday works for me . its cold enough to hold the ice tonite? ill jump the shore line to get out 1 more time.
563325,oldphart,2011-03-19 12:18:00,665,"~~~~With my knees I don't jump, but if the lake breaks up early, my boat is ready to go, just have to put the batteries in."
563404,kickingfrog,2011-03-19 18:20:00,8333,"Too bad, cause today's weather would have been perfect for late icefishin'  I may hit some shore fish tomorrow."
562779,kickingfrog,2011-03-17 20:49:00,8333,"Calling for some showers tonight, but that's it.  Ice should hold."
562792,misfish,2011-03-17 21:54:00,29133,"Anyone local with a gas auger to give a hand punching some holes.I,ll be there around 2pm.40 or so holes should do. Swiss cheese come to mind.LOL"

562803,misfish,2011-03-17 22:09:00,29133,"Put yer reading glasses on bud.  Yes ,same spot as before."

562905,fishnsled,2011-03-18 03:25:00,3520,Wish I could make it. Sounds like it will be a great time. Enjoy and take lots of pics.  I'm hoping to get out on Sunday.
562907,irishfield,2011-03-18 03:28:00,26272,It looks like I may still be sleepin alone by Saturday am.... so I may just make it down Brian. Now if my cuddle bunny comes back home Friday night.. I'm out for sure ! lol
562915,HTHM,2011-03-18 03:49:00,4082,I hope for your sake she hops on up home!
562917,irishfield,2011-03-18 03:58:00,26272,
562923,Cudz,2011-03-18 04:38:00,2652,Brian I can't help drill holes friday.  I have no probs deilling holes for people on Saturday though.  I have a manual auger but it takes me about 30 seconds to drill a hole.
562929,misfish,2011-03-18 09:11:00,29133,VERY WARM THIS MORNING  
562958,Governator,2011-03-18 12:44:00,879,  There is actually no snow left on my property when I woke up this morning (minus some snow bank stuff).  Be safe out there.
562977,irishfield,2011-03-18 13:47:00,26272,-6C over night Brian.. it'll tighten it all up for the am.
562984,oldphart,2011-03-18 14:05:00,665,"~~~Anyone know what temp. they keep the beer at in Hooter's, last thing we need is warm beer to ruin the day"
562995,misfish,2011-03-18 14:38:00,29133,TTT
563003,irishfield,2011-03-18 15:00:00,26272,You not got a 2x12 plank bud??
563005,asdve23rveavwa,2011-03-18 15:07:00,2690,"No sweat, Brian.  Maybe next year!"
563008,misfish,2011-03-18 15:15:00,29133, Not wanting to risk anyone getting hurt Wayne.
563038,Billy Bob,2011-03-18 16:41:00,5865,"Actually, I take that as good news......maybe some crappie fishing is in store next week...  :clapping:"
563047,NAW,2011-03-18 16:59:00,4022,What's going on for tomorrow then.  Cancelled..??
563048,irishfield,2011-03-18 17:01:00,26272,Brian edited the subject.. it says Cancelled... and he put this in the first post.  SORRY EVERYONE. JUST DID A VISIT TO THE SPOT AND THERES 4 FT GAP OF WATER AT THE EDGE. EVEN THE MARINA DOCKS ARE SHOWING WATER AROUND THE EDGES OF THEM.GUESS THE RAIN DIDNT HELP.
563050,misfish,2011-03-18 17:06:00,29133,"Thanks Wayne. With the wind also,the ice could shift making an even wider opening at the shore."
563053,NAW,2011-03-18 17:11:00,4022, Wups..  Missed that.  Next year!
563054,irishfield,2011-03-18 17:12:00,26272,You could still go to hOOters for a beer !!
563055,misfish,2011-03-18 17:16:00,29133,Hooters and beer at home.
562159,asdve23rveavwa,2011-03-15 22:50:00,2690," LOL, fingers crossed for favorable conditions."
562214,Skud,2011-03-16 01:23:00,739,Todays warm weather did not effect the ice at all. The holes actually continued to freeze over. 16 inches of solid black ice under 6 inches of white ice
562232,dhickey,2011-03-16 02:09:00,1038,any room uot there 4 salty? dindnt make it out today. ???
562450,Terry,2011-03-16 18:48:00,14456,so how is it looking
562453,misfish,2011-03-16 18:57:00,29133,"Still good bud.The rain did nothing to the shorline,,,,,,,,,,,YET.More rain called for thurday but we should be good to go. I,ll be punching holes Friday after work."
562632,NAW,2011-03-17 12:12:00,4022,"I cleared up me weekend..  I'm in for some pike fishin.  What's the deal with bait?  Still being supplied?  Included in the $5 entry fee, or should I bring some spare change?"
562650,Cudz,2011-03-17 13:40:00,2652,ok. I am back in as long as access is good and I will have to be done at noon.
562657,misfish,2011-03-17 13:54:00,29133,"  Yes dear.  Chris if you want,meet me down there friday around 2pm.Thats when I,ll be punching holes.  Also the bait shop has pike minnows for those that need.  The out of towners know where were fishing?  Exit onto Bayfield off the 400. Turn right and go right down to the lake. Make a left.You will see hooters.Thats where you park.  Have to make a run will check the ice while Im out."
562682,skeeter,2011-03-17 15:15:00,1907,"There is going to be 2 more added to the list for saturday. My son Daniel & myself.  Are pike minnows the go 2 bait, how much are they?"
562688,skeeter,2011-03-17 15:32:00,1907,"Hey Oldphart, you still want to go?"
562691,misfish,2011-03-17 15:40:00,29133,"Not sure there Skeet on the price. I just hook large shiners myself, in the tail.."
562712,perchslayer666,2011-03-17 17:03:00,280,"If the shoreline ice is good when you do your test tomorrow I might be able to come down, and bring a friend...  Is the fishing good there? How do you think the perch action will be?  Hopefully it's good to go, would love one more kick at the can."
562740,misfish,2011-03-17 18:50:00,29133,"Shore was good today. Fishing is well fishing.Thier there or thier not.LOL  Perch will be there,pike cruise the area."
562742,asdve23rveavwa,2011-03-17 18:57:00,2690,"I'm 50/50, depends on a possible steelhead outing.  Really surprised the ice is holding up."
562744,misfish,2011-03-17 18:58:00,29133,"It,s still cool with the breeze here.And didnt get that pounding sun they called for."
562746,oldphart,2011-03-17 19:04:00,665,"~~~Yep I'm still up for it, check your PM bud"
562754,Billy Bob,2011-03-17 19:24:00,5865,Sounds VERY tempting....if it was only closer to me....hope you have good ice and weather.  Bob
562758,NAW,2011-03-17 19:43:00,4022,I just called my fishing partner.  He'll be joining us too.
562759,misfish,2011-03-17 19:47:00,29133,"Shaping up to be a good G&G folks.  It,s a bit of a hike for ya Billy I know.Thanks."
562760,irishfield,2011-03-17 19:52:00,26272,"7am on a Saturday.... man that's like Lloyd o'clock...  I prefer... 9 O'clock on a Saturday, regular crowd shuffles in...."
562762,asdve23rveavwa,2011-03-17 19:58:00,2690, LOL...Lloyd o'clock would be more like 5:30 AM.
562765,Terry,2011-03-17 20:01:00,14456,lets not get silly there  7 is early enough  now can I run my skidoo up from innisfil to the bay
562767,asdve23rveavwa,2011-03-17 20:08:00,2690," Definitely early enough, especially if travelling 2- 2 1/4 hours to get there!! What's the depth of the water that tight to town?"
562769,misfish,2011-03-17 20:13:00,29133,20-40 fow is where Im drilling.
562772,Governator,2011-03-17 20:19:00,879,I've had the flu since last friday and I'm finally starting to feel better now.  This sounds very tempting but I think it's best I pass.
561427,misfish,2011-03-13 20:37:00,29133,"SORRY EVERYONE. JUST DID A VISIT TO THE SPOT AND THERES 4 FT GAP OF WATER AT THE EDGE. EVEN THE MARINA DOCKS ARE SHOWING WATER AROUND THE EDGES OF THEM.GUESS THE RAIN DIDNT HELP.        A few years back I use to hold a fun pike derby here in Barrie.This is when lakers and whites are now closed,but perch can be caught there aswell. It,s just a fun half day event.7am-12pm. A day to M&G and have fun. 5 dollar entry,one winner.Longest fish, not wieght.The walk is like 2 minutes,just out from hooters.Ya we can have a cold one after were done.Holes will have been drilled before you arrive ,not sure about bait,as I havent checked with the local shop or been to Jacobs this year,but will give a call if thiers enough intrest."
561466,dhickey,2011-03-13 22:34:00,1038,sounds like fun. i can bring pike minnows up. i will double check that 2moro.
561507,Rizzo,2011-03-14 00:48:00,4754,"lets call me a ""possible"" (might have to work). Penny usually has pike bait over at rack & reel"
561508,Cudz,2011-03-14 00:54:00,2652,a definate maybe
561511,BillM,2011-03-14 01:00:00,17367,"Brian, you should be steelheading"
561573,misfish,2011-03-14 10:20:00,29133,"  I have to use up the gas in the auger Bill.After that,it,s river time."
561641,Beans,2011-03-14 15:04:00,3339,Maybe next year Brian...  Great times were had previously...    Even Lew joined us the first year (no pic tho...damn)
561652,lew,2011-03-14 15:40:00,12766," I remember that day well Norm, lotsa laffs despite the torrential downpour all morning.  Nice burgers in Hooters afterwards though"
561654,misfish,2011-03-14 15:53:00,29133,  That was not the best day. Terry found out his suit was no longer water proof aswell.
561670,Skud,2011-03-14 17:01:00,739,I may be good to go. Hope the shoreline ice holds up with the warm weather coming.
561751,kickingfrog,2011-03-14 19:45:00,8333,I'm a definite maybe. We'll see what this week brings.
561756,misfish,2011-03-14 19:56:00,29133,"  I stopped by and had a look.Shoreline is solid for now.I,ll be keeping an eye on it as the week goes by.Still cold enough at night to keep it tight I think."
561776,NAW,2011-03-14 20:58:00,4022,A strong maybe for me.  Depends on how much work I can get done this week.  I'll know thursday.
561859,Rizzo,2011-03-15 00:10:00,4754,I'm out. Gotta work Saturday
562025,oldphart,2011-03-15 16:14:00,665,"~~~Love to get in on the action but stuck in Ajax with no transportation, anyone in Ajax wanna give it a shot"
562078,johnnyb,2011-03-15 19:17:00,3413,I'm a healthy maybe....would be great to meet some more OFC'ers...and I have a pile of deadbait that needs to be used up.
562093,asdve23rveavwa,2011-03-15 20:04:00,2690,"Sounds like fun, would love to get out one last time, but, how will the ice be after 9 and 10 degrees, Thursday/Friday? Also, how is the parking there?"
562096,misfish,2011-03-15 20:09:00,29133,"  Ya I seen the temps and rain aswell.Looks like it will be a last minute call.As for parking,LOTS."
562098,kickingfrog,2011-03-15 20:13:00,8333," The ice? We'll have to see, the temps for the short term shouldn't hurt it too much, but the rain in the forecast might.  There is lots of free parking spaces on a Saturday at this time of year.  Edit: Wow I type/think slow."
562099,asdve23rveavwa,2011-03-15 20:14:00,2690," See how things pan out over the next few days, if the ice stays solid enough, I'd be interested...if not, I'm leaning towards some chrome."
562109,misfish,2011-03-15 20:23:00,29133,"There is lots of ice out there. It will be just the accessing part,but it,s cold enough at night I dont see there being an issue."
562111,asdve23rveavwa,2011-03-15 20:30:00,2690," If the ice and access are good, and it's within walking distance from shore, count me in."
562114,Terry,2011-03-15 20:36:00,14456,"not sure yet but I might be able to make it.........I guess we have to walk, no skidoos......walk I don't know"
562119,misfish,2011-03-15 20:58:00,29133," Tell ya what,I,ll tie a rope to yer angle and drag yer   the 200 ft.Hows that?"
562121,misfish,2011-03-15 20:59:00,29133," You wont even break a sweat Frankie.Hell if I drag Terys   ,I wont even break one.LOL"
