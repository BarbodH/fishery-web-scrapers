562705,Bob Devine,2011-03-17 16:45:00,251,The satellite pics show there is plently of ice 2/3 on Lake St. Clair and some in Lake Huron which means walleye fishing is just around the corner. I usually get the boat in the first weekend of April and this yr is shaping up to be on schedule. Fishing is usually a bit slow to start but a good chance to land a trophy. As the water warms and mid April rolls in so does the action. Most of the shows that you have seen on TV with good action have taken place from April 15-30th. At this time of yr you will have walleyes in all stages of the spawning process and the river will have a million or so walleyes to catch. Remember to fish smart and practice selective harvest.  
562707,Terry,2011-03-17 16:48:00,14456,nice  wish I lived closer would love to get out there to fish for them  I can't wait to get the boat on the water
562710,The Urban Fisherman,2011-03-17 16:54:00,2050,Took the kids out to check the creek last night... I've been watching those images as well to see when the ice pops out of the bay - we just need a good strong north west wind to blow it out and I'll be in the boat!  
562716,fishrking,2011-03-17 17:11:00,24,This could be the year I make it to fish spring walleyes on St.Clair - fingers crossed.
562720,Mike Pike,2011-03-17 17:22:00,1332,I read about wading for walleyes on the St. Clair river in 'Ontario Out Of Doors Magazine' a couple years ago.  I've been wanting to travel down and give it a go myself.  Has anyone enjoyed walleye fishing the St. Clair in waders?
562726,bubbles,2011-03-17 17:54:00,591,"I am getting the itch myself, did a drive by today to have a look.  Looking like we will be floating out there in about a week!!!"
562729,Mark Kulik,2011-03-17 18:06:00,348,That is a ton of fun and lots of nice Eyes-hope to make it down this spring!
562730,lookinforwalleye,2011-03-17 18:07:00,4399,Soft water anything will be great!!!
563076,Bob Devine,2011-03-18 18:28:00,251,Looks like you got your NW winds Ryan. Bubbles with all that ice I think it will be more like two wks April 2 but I have been wrong before.. Mark that was fun fishing together that day and others.. lol Have you learned how to make ballon animals HAHA. Let me know I have some days off during the wk we good get out. For those looking to make the trip south it is about 3.5 hrs from the Big Bass store in Vaughan to the marina.
563171,camillj,2011-03-18 22:08:00,1988,Nope but we used to wade for pickeral right in the heart of Lindsay (bout 35 years ago) ... yellow bucktails and blue jointed rapalas were the thing back then.
563173,Billy Bob,2011-03-18 22:11:00,5865,With walleye close here in NYS until the first Sat in May I will have to make do with LOTS of crappies until then...
