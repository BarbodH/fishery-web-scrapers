The 9.0 magnitude quake (the fourth-largest recorded since 1900) was caused when the Pacific tectonic plate dove under the North American plate, which shifted Eastern Japan towards North America by about 13 feet (see NASA's before and after photos at right). The quake also shifted the earth's axis by 6.5 inches, shortened the day by 1.6 microseconds, and sank Japan downward by about two feet. As Japan's eastern coastline sunk, the tsunami's waves rolled in."

563220,NAC,2011-03-19 00:17:00,369,moving the earth's axis by 6.5 inches is pretty impressive!  How'd that affect all your GPS locations??
563231,skeeter,2011-03-19 00:43:00,1907,"I would guess that your gps locations would be out by about 6.5"" Of course that would only effect your way points."
563244,dhickey,2011-03-19 01:08:00,1038,it truely is mother nature at her finest. to think that all of the continents move at a rate of 2 cm per year. and what can we do?   nothing. but help those that fall victim.   truely is humbling.
563245,mercman,2011-03-19 01:10:00,7054,I dunno Skeets !!! 6.5 inches can make a HUGE difference.
563253,skeeter,2011-03-19 01:31:00,1907,"6.5"" alone, stands by its self. 6.5"" MORE makes a Huge difference, both horizontally and vertically !!"
563257,canadadude,2011-03-19 01:36:00,769,"It will be non negotiable, 6.5 inches is nothing in the entire earth, the earth is billions of inches. Your GPS locations may be off by 0.OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO6 can all of you adjust."
563259,canadadude,2011-03-19 01:43:00,769,your GPSmay be out 0.00000000000000000000000000001 .....better call somebody to calibrate.....the sky is falling
563263,dhickey,2011-03-19 01:49:00,1038,hey skeeter.  its here.  the sky is falling.  i saw a pig flying by my balcony while i was looking at the moon.     
563270,mercman,2011-03-19 01:59:00,7054, You bin smokin that wildwood weed again
563272,Guest LivingLegend,2011-03-19 02:04:00,0,Im about to pass some gas that will shift it another 6.5................. what was in those meatballs???
563273,dhickey,2011-03-19 02:05:00,1038,ill turn off my computer first!
563276,canadadude,2011-03-19 02:09:00,769,"after the tsunami Japan's coastline rose by 8'5 feet, due to the earthquake, the pacific shelf increased the coastline by 8'5. This is significant to anyone using GPS all previous data is irrelevent at this time. The one Pacific plate lifted the other to an average of 8.5' which to most of us we relise is a large change. Just think in the Kawarthawas if all of a sudden your 8.5' higher, although it is relative to Ocean depth the contours and such are way out of wack right now"
