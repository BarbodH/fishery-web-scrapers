Thanks to the time change the kids and I were able to eat supper and run out to check the water levels and get some fresh air before bed time.  The flooding has gone down but its still over the banks in some places!  Wont be long before all that water pushes the ice out and we'll be in the boat on the bay!  Flooded fields along the creek bank   Still over the banks in some places   Won't be using the bridge anytime soon   Pretty high and fast..   Anyways getting the itch something fierce!  Cheers, Ryan & tha kidz"
