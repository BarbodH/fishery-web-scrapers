I had just released a dink and started to let the jig fall back down the hole when I saw a thick red mark on my vex. I closed the bail, jigged twice and the fish slammed it! Peeled line and fought well. I think it was checking out all of the comotion with the earlier dink because she was under the hole right after I sent the small guy back. It was a high pressure day, no clouds, didn't expect anything special. Ended up icing 16 fish between the two of us. Bait shop was out of minnows, so salties tipped on tubes and spoons was on the menu.     All fished were released."
