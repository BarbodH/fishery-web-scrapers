562951,Lunker Larry,2011-03-18 12:32:00,122,"I used to use them quite regularly for smallies but for some reason, maybe a few slow days of no action on them, they fell out of use. Might clean the rust off some this summer and see what transpires. I have both Rapala and Cotton cordells baits, and tended to have more successon the Cordells. No rhyme or reason other than maybe the size, colour or rattle.  Ref Japanese lures. You'd be hard pressed to sell me on that idea. I've fished the north where we would toss our silver cigarette paper out and pike and trout would hit it. I have a friend who used to make spoons out of....well..spoons! And they worked as good as any manufactured bait."

559245,DoubleDigits,2011-03-07 21:43:00,140,"   Who mentioned live bait? I guess because I questioned your logic, I must be an idiot redneck (because I guess live bait is for rednecks??). Most would be too embarrassed to display that kind of snobbery, but I suppose true snobs couldn't care less.   Don't you think that research and craftsmanship went into designing classic, time-tested fishing lures? Poor rubes like me have done OK with them. Its all about confidence, and clearly for you, that doesn't come without paying a steep price. To each his own. I would say good luck fishing, but it doesn't sound like you need any."
559255,PainInTheBass,2011-03-07 21:57:00,102," Is there any data to suppor this claim?  Or, is it all anecdotal, or even based on company advertising?  When ripping rattle baits, or when using any reaction bait for that matter, do you know for certain that fish see more than a profile?  How do you then explain spinnerbaits' effectiveness?  Or a spoon?  Other tangible differences can tilt the odds in the angler's favour, such as different vibrations or rattles.   Different hydrodynamics to alter the fall can also have an effect (as you did indicate).  However, to make a blanket statement such as that, with no evidence in light of the success many have had with domestic lures is going to incite some strong reactions."

They fit the bill for a bait that can be allowed to run deep with a little ""drop time"" and long line.  Usually on or around the May long weekend the trout begin to go a bit deeper...in a slow bite the rattle of the rattle'n rap is Just what the doctor ordered when the spoons are not pulling their weight"
559434,fishindude,2011-03-08 06:18:00,220," Well, they're lipless crankbaits so yes, I would say your regular crankbait rod would suffice  These lures are intended to be retrieved with a softer rod with good parabolic action based on my catches, and having the softer rod allows the thin wire trebles better chance of hooking up with the fishies"
559439,Live2fish85,2011-03-08 07:18:00,1633,"Snidley I don't need to by some expensive Japanese Lure to catch bass I fish bass from first day it opens until it close and for the most part it's how you present it that matters not the colour of the eyes on the lure, if something isn't working, change it up until you find what is working. I don't think that if your throwing a Rapala crankbait and the fish aren't hitting but you throw some expensive Japanese crankbait of similarities to rapala it's going to hit. They aren't going to hit the lure more because it's 20 Dollars."

559459,craigdritchie,2011-03-08 12:33:00,1586,"One option is to throw lipless cranks on a heavier spinning outfit and fish them like a jig. It's obviously not something you want to try on a snag-infested bottom, but it's a great way to locate active fish on open areas, like when they're scattered over sand flats. Works great on shale too (think Erie)."
559472,PainInTheBass,2011-03-08 13:08:00,102,"I prefer a MH fast action rod for my lipless crankbaits because i do tend to throw them around weedbeds, burning them over, trying to tick the tops of the weeds.  I find that the fast action and MH power help me to rip the lure free.  I had tried them on my mh moderate-fast crankbait rod, and didnt like the action for this application.  However, you may actually like the action.  It is all a matter of preference."

I got to throw it a little bit at Lake Toho last month, and found it to be quite weedless for a libless crankbait.  This is due to the wide head, which I am sure is also teh reason for the the vibration even on slow retrieves.  It appears to be a very flexible lipless crankbait that I will throw alot this year.  I also really like the finishes on these lures.  I like them alot so far."

That is fishing for Smallies to I have had luck with largemouth to. But I really like them silver with the blue top and red/orange bottom is a great one on Lake Erie. The Cotton Cordell Spot is a great one a few sizes is good to they work in shallow as well, Under certain conditions. Good Luck."
559057,solopaddler,2011-03-07 12:04:00,8605,"One of the all time best search baits imo.  Sometimes they don't want a super loud rattle though.  Many of these baits are made with a much more subtle rattle, sometimes that's the key."

Like anything though, you don`t go fishing with one lure? Sometimes they are hot sometimes there are better choices in your lure selection. A great search bait, but a spinnerbait can be also, and is more snag free."

559109,Snidley,2011-03-07 15:40:00,620,"Rattle traps are like any other hardbait, there's a time and place. With that consideration I personally never use anything but hardbaits for all species and still do well virtually every time out and in heavily pressured waters. I think that for many anglers their lack of success  is rooted in throwing baits that the fish are conditioned too. Cordel spots and Rattlin Rapalas have been around for 25 years. Same goes with Bill Lewis rattlers. They were good a decade ago. Try Lucky Craft LV300/500, LVRs, Evergreen Buzzerbeaters, Yozuri Hardcore Drums, Jackal TN 50,60,70. First thing you will notice is that these baits look much different (ultra realistic)and are offered in loud rattle, soft rattle and silent as well as 3 or 4 sizes. They are designed to fall with a shimmey and some will rest on bottom without falling over (for jigging). If you really want to catch fish go to the absolute king of this style of bait and bag yourself some Viper Design Risebackers. They are configured so as to come through weeds like no other hardbait and in early season they will load your boat. Like all artificial presentations fish will become conditioned to lures they get caught on or see their fellows get caught on and if you rely on the same lures that thousands of other anglers use, like Rapalas, Cordels etc. then you should expect to do poorly. I'm constantly amazed that this basic fact of fishing eludes so many anglers. I guess it comes down the $$$ but the same guys trying to catch fish on inexpensive lures will own a $50K truck towing a $40K boat burning through large amounts of $1.35/ltr gas just to get there. Then they tie on a cheap unrealistic looking lure that the fish have seen a thousand times and wonder why no luck. Bottom line is that rattlers work, for all species but not all the time. This means you have to have backup plans for when they don't want a fast moving, or loud, or big, or small or bright, or ghost etc. Finding out what they want IS the fun."
559120,mercman,2011-03-07 16:34:00,7054,"10-4 Snidley Always fun trying to outsmart your prey. I will be trying out a lure this summer that i'm sure no one has used in the waters where i fish.

That's funny. Sounds more like a case of not spending enough time fishing a certain type of bait, and building confidence. Just curious... on a given day, on a random lake in Ontario, how many 'cheap' lipless rattle baits do you think a bass sees? Is the knowledge about certain lures passed down from generation to generation? How often do these discerning bass chuckle at the stupid looking Rapala only to slam a $20 japanese lure??"

559168,ehg,2011-03-07 18:19:00,2666, I swear by RattlinRaps for fishing multispecies out of warm water discharges in midwinter. Almost use them exclusively there.  On a windy day this past summer tried slow trolling RattlinRaps along 10 ft. break and hammered smallmouth by surprise.They are now part of my bass chucking arsenal. A Badonk-a-Donk is purely a topwater not a lipless crankbait.
559175,fishindude,2011-03-07 18:40:00,220,"I'm actually quite fond of the smaller ""junior"" sized rattle baits, run these over the tops of weeds and HANG ON!  For the common sized rattle baits, I agree that they are good search baits in deeper water and are great for calling the fish in. I like working these baits with a steady retrieve, and also reeling in the slack line and sweeping the lure back with the rod, then reeling in the slack again and repeat; I find this method produces the loudest rattle out of the bait depending on how hard your sweep the rod. It all depends on the mood of the fish, temperature, conditions etc."
559190,Snidley,2011-03-07 19:29:00,620,"Clearly Double Digits likes common lures. Thank goodness after all there's always live bait. For the rest of the guys here, there's a reason top anglers use Japanese lures when money is involved or they want to max out their success. Bottom line is if you are satisfied with Rapalas or any other ""domestic"" lures you are missing LOTS of fish virtually antwhere you fish around the GTA or even southern Ontario. Same goes for quality spinnerbaits over the 3 for $10 ones you see on bait store racks. Quality lures take research and execution to manufacture, just like cars, boats, clothes etc. Even in remote locations where the fish are not conditioned quality Japanese lures will consitently out fish Rapalas and the other American hardbait products (except Hildebandts of course) This is somthing virtually all dedicated high profile anglers know (but frequently do not tell to the general public)"
