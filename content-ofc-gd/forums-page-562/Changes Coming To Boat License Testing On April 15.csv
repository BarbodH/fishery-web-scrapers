Effective April 15 the procedure for Internet testing will change, and and the number of questions on the exam will increase to 50.  It's still nothing more than a stupid cash grab, but if you need the card you may as well get it now before the test becomes longer, apparently a bit more difficult, and quite possibly a little more expensive."
