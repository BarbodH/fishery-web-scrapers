562724,mercman,2011-03-17 17:38:00,7054," Thanks for that John !!! When i see my brother next time, i am going to see if he will part with som of his old crank baits and such. I know he has tons of them in boxes somewhere.I love the nostalgia of the old stuff. I used to have a Sigma, back about 25 years ago just like that one."
562731,Lunker Larry,2011-03-17 18:12:00,122,The old Mitchels reminded me of the one I had. If I let it sit with line on it the line would crush the spool. Happened 2 or three times before I gave up on it.
562748,mercman,2011-03-17 19:08:00,7054, WOW !! What kinda line ? Mono?. These 2 have been sitting for at leas 25 years without being used and the spools are perfect. I even have 4 or 5 extra spools.
562752,TroutSlayer,2011-03-17 19:22:00,64,"Great shots Mercman! Here's a few of mine old clunkers. Some are my ""go to"" reels still today. I thought I posted these already, but can't find them.                   ["
562766,mercman,2011-03-17 20:05:00,7054,"Whats the Mitchel with the cone shaped bobin?? Never seen one like tha before. What was it used for. The zebco4, was another i used to own. I cant belive i sold them all, years ago for a 24 of molson"
562774,TroutSlayer,2011-03-17 20:27:00,64," The ""wedding cake"" Mitchell was built for tournament casting. I still have a fair number of Cardinal 3 and 4 models:  "
561414,mercman,2011-03-13 20:06:00,7054,"Thought some of you may be interested in seeing some old reels and metal lures that belonged to my Dad. First is a Phlueger Pakron 3178 he used for lake trout way back....in the 60's-70's     Mitchel 300 and 301   a Shakespeare President 1978 on a Denco  Tiger Claw worm rod     Some old spoons.No clue what they are or what they were used for   Acouple of really small reels that must have been considered ultrallite 30 or 40 years ago. Cant make out the manufacturer.     Enjoy, and feel free to input if you recognize anything, or have any info.  Paul"
561418,HTHM,2011-03-13 20:11:00,4082,WOW! I love seeing old tackle.
561420,kickingfrog,2011-03-13 20:16:00,8333,Thanks for posting.
561423,vinnimon,2011-03-13 20:31:00,2593,"Nice, thanks for posting Paul. I have the exact same mitchell 301 and I was eyeing an eagle claw rod for riggin at the bait shop yesterday. Looks just like the one you posted but bigger."
561426,MCTFisher9120,2011-03-13 20:34:00,3761,"Hey man awesome pics, I too like seeing old tackle. Perhaps we can turn this thread into a ""show and tell"" of old tackle and rods/reels. This lure was my Papa's moms and she passed it down to him...she passed away a number of years ago but I now have the possession of this cool piece of history. I took a quick look and didn't see a date on the package. Any guess as to the approx year?  I  got the old rapala in it's original case with the price tag on it...love that thing...here are too many pics of it                      Hope to see some more, out of curiosity what value do these old mint condition baits have?  Keep em coming,  MTBF"
561436,Bernie,2011-03-13 21:00:00,3190,Cool stuff Merc. You have to wonder how some of that old equipment even worked.  Dad has some old stuff around his place too. And maybe a few rarely seen interesting ones as well. Maybe I'll take a few pictures this summer when I think of it.
561456,ckrb2007,2011-03-13 21:43:00,449,I love the old price tag on those old rapalas. lol $1.85.
561464,mercman,2011-03-13 22:28:00,7054, Thanks Bernie.  Dad would be awe struck if he could see some of the newer technology of todays fishing tools.Those 2 mitchels caught a lot of fish Bernie.He used them for years and years before he got his first Penn round baitcaster back in the late 80's early 90's. He had a 12' alunimun and an old Elgin motor.It was my job to bail I miss him terrible.
561550,Leecher,2011-03-14 02:23:00,7832,Awesome Paul Love seeing the old reels and spoons Fishing apparel sure has evolve some Thanks for taking the time and share those memories with us!!! Jacques
561555,dhickey,2011-03-14 02:32:00,1038,nice pics.  brings back times of sitting in the boat bourd out of my mind as a child checking out my dads stuf.  when i get my picture problem worked out ill post some of his tackle.  i could use some help with posting pics.  kinda new at this.  nice mercman very nice!
561557,highdrifter,2011-03-14 02:42:00,2534,That's a really cool collection..  My old pop never really fished much but he did like dumpster diving and picked me up a couple from a garage sale once..  They're sitting proudly with my other babies on a glass shelf in the living room.  The ones you have should be showcased in a nice cabinet!!  Thanks budday!
561561,BassAsin,2011-03-14 02:51:00,806,that hasn't changed much has it?   maybe one decimal place is all. lol
561562,BassAsin,2011-03-14 02:52:00,806,cool pics paul.  i still use a mitchell 300 on one of my rods   the 301's seem to be much more rare.
561576,bigugli,2011-03-14 10:47:00,6138,"I only retired my 300A a few years back, and have since found me another solid 300 that I will use for catting. As for those small level winds, they were your normal bass and walleye reels in the day. As a kid I learnt to fish with one. Black line, bobber and hook off uncle's dock."
561578,mercman,2011-03-14 10:56:00,7054,"Thanks Guys My Bro got the bulk of his gear. since he was into fishing more than me,at the time.He said he will give me a bunch more next time i see him"
561582,OhioFisherman,2011-03-14 11:38:00,6623,"You have to have the perspective on things back in the day, two bucks was easily a half hours pay for most people. I believe some of those baitcasters are older than the 60`s. Hard for me to say exactly what was being sold up there though back in the late 50`s and early 60`s, I was still fairly young."
561589,Harrison,2011-03-14 12:24:00,2202,"Great stuff.  Is the one spoon on the right a ""Abu toby""?  If so, it could be worth something.  Looks like an original Williams there too.  Mike, that rapala is a nice keep sake.  Not worth alot yet, but could be."
561591,Headhunter,2011-03-14 12:44:00,5703,"Nice collection... in many cases, the box is worht more than the lure, so i would be very careful with it. As mentioned, it should be put away in a safe place, unless and until you decide to part with it. HH"
561620,mercman,2011-03-14 14:16:00,7054," Not sure if it is an Abu Toby, i will look at it tonite. The williams is original though. I have a feeling a couple of the older bait casters belonged to my grandfather, but i'm not sure.  Thanks for all the info Paul"
561638,Harrison,2011-03-14 15:01:00,2202," Can't tell 100% by the pic as it looks alittle thin, but the oringal Tobys can sell for over $100 bucks."
561667,JohnF,2011-03-14 16:43:00,3494,The second one down from the sppons might be an Ocean City level winder. A friend of mine has one by that name.  Now you've got me interested. I have a bunch of my Dad's old reels and a few rods. I'll get some pics and post 'em soon.  Also a few about 20 yrs old that I bought for my kids. No idea if they're any good. Probably not but perhaps someone here will recognize them.  JF
561673,mercman,2011-03-14 17:14:00,7054,That would be Great John
561890,Glaucus,2011-03-15 01:05:00,48, The Shakespeare President was the top of the line model. Here's a description of your reel from a 1949 catalogue.  
561899,mercman,2011-03-15 01:21:00,7054,Thanks Glaucus  I had no idea it was that old Wow top of the line back then too.
562723,JohnF,2011-03-17 17:24:00,3494,
