562587,nofish4me,2011-03-17 01:49:00,404,"Have you ever read the title on a thread and mentally formed a response, only to find out (after reading thread) your answer wouldn't apply. For instance, the topic ""2 Greys"" with pictures, I half expected to see pictures of Wayne and Roy. Then, there is the topic ""Boat scum removal"", my reply (before reading the posts), would have been to throw the buggers overboard. Anyone else formulate responses in thier head before opening topics?"
