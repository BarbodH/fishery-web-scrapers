563006,asdve23rveavwa,2011-03-18 15:11:00,2690,Gotta love the north!!!!!!  Now if I could just move our distribution center up there

563040,ehg,2011-03-18 16:48:00,2666,Great pics and report Amazing brookies!
563056,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-03-18 17:17:00,0, Still lots of snow last weekend although I think they got pummeled by rain this week.  We didn't actually make it to GW but we got those bigger fish from Moulder... and here I thought it was just a swamp! Heading back to try something easier this weekend!  Luc
563067,troutologist,2011-03-18 18:01:00,951," Good luck this weekend.  Apr 20-25, shirk all responsibilities...its going to be steelhead madness.  Prepare yourself. The soundtrack"
563069,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-03-18 18:11:00,0," After all the housework this fall/winter I'm pretty sure I'll be well into ""shirking"" by then, and it will likely continue until the brookies stop biting in june.  Snowpacks this year should help fill the reservoirs that were so empty last year..."
562802,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-03-17 22:09:00,0,"Saturday I headed north with two friends for some backcountry brookies.  We made a 2 hour hike into a chain of lakes we were familiar with and weren't disappointed.  We caught somewhere over 30 fish for the day including some real fat fish from the one lake.  Each of us kept a limit of small/badly hooked fish and we released just as many.  Not a lot of pics to share but of the unfortunate souls that became dinner.  Back up north for some spring fishing this weekend!  There's also a few other pics taken from various snowmobile trips/drunken weekends at camp...  Dr. Sal  Some nice brookies   A slow but steady February produced a lot of days like this at camp   I finally got my wife and son on the sled... note the potty on my lap!   One day we drove into a fly-in lake.  We didn't catch any brutes, but we lost track of how many of these we caught   My cousin with a few fish at camp.   Another little laker with a VERY bright coat   A natural brookie on a lake with predominantly namaycush   A nicer speck caught on the stocked lakes near town "
562806,Terry,2011-03-17 22:23:00,14456,nice  looks like fun  wish I had some back lake brookie lakes around here
