I will fish whatever days but noticed many years ago that best days and  PB's were caught on couple of days around full moon. Figures that this 'super moon' occurs when fishing is least possible for most. A few things are still open, so good luck to steelheaders near Great Lakes, panfishers on ice or whoever has someplace and something to fish for. The bite is usually good during daylight but sucks at night during full moon. Good Luck"
