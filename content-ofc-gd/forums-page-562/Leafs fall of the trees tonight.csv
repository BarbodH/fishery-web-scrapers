562992,Governator,2011-03-18 14:27:00,879,"They'd basically have to go 9-1 last 10 games to reach 90pts, the so called magic number to the make the playoffs.  Ain't gonna happen.  After NJ lost last night they need to go 10-2 which is possible the way they play.  I'd say only NJ has a legitimate shot at making it in."

563070,ctranter,2011-03-18 18:13:00,543," Because Reimer can score goals, right?"
563152,Jer,2011-03-18 21:33:00,1426,  No...but the team plays better in front of him.
563169,Live2fish85,2011-03-18 22:07:00,1633,"I'm a die hard leafs fan and always have been. I grew up watching them and will probably die watching them lol, due to a heart attack because they are useless lol no just kidding but they won't make the playoffs I have said that since the start of the season. But I think with Burke there in a few years they will be a good team and hopefully make the playoffs, One good thing though is that I don't have to worry about them cutting in to my fishing time lol."
