Drop in for a chat, ask questions, buy a button or just talk about fishing Rice Lake this spring.  Great discounts on accommodations and boat rentals with many of the Rice Lake Tourist Association members offering special festival rates from May 14-June 19 during the Rice Lake Spring Fishing Festival.  I will be in our booth #454 in the fishing section. Looking forward to meeting everyone."

562671,superdad,2011-03-17 14:31:00,353,"Visited the Show on Wednesday and thoroughly enjoyed the day. We spent almost four hours walking and talking to people, some I hadn't seen ortalked for over 20 years.  The show was reorganized from last year and held many more things that would appeal to younger attendee, teh Canadian Army had a large display and interactive area for differnt ages groups and there was much shouting and cheering at the fish pond when someone landed a trout....  The fish tank and the speakers were all very good with good attendance also.  Lots of fishing tackle and outfitters and agencies to talk about the outdoors.  Good show and will bring the grandsons next year.  Cheers and good luck to those involved with the show and attending on a daily basis  David  aka  Supererdad"
