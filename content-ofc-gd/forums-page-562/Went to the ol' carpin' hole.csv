I took a drive to my local carp spot to find a horrible sight        There are quite a few dead carp all over. Looks like I will have to find a couple more spots. Enjoyed a nice walk anyway and the kids are getting excited for some warm weather and fishing      "

562378,hammercarp,2011-03-16 14:26:00,964,That sucks about the pond. Looks like the kids enjoyed the day outdoors though. If you think you have the itch. I go crazy this time of year. The carp angling club that I am a member of has guys from the southern states posting pictures of the 20's and 30's they are catching in places like Tennessee and the Carolinas.

562517,Marko,2011-03-16 21:24:00,854,Thats not what i wanted to see! I got couple of nice ones there last year. I am sure there are plenty left behind...
562551,danbouck,2011-03-17 00:11:00,4380,I walked the entire creek and there were no spots deep enough so let's hope they come in from the river.
562581,The Urban Fisherman,2011-03-17 01:37:00,2050,You inspired me to take the kids down the road to big creek tonight... Like the rest of the gang said... They'll be back!
562778,Trevor0179,2011-03-17 20:44:00,65,wow that looks terrible man there were some big old fish in there that sucks!!!!
