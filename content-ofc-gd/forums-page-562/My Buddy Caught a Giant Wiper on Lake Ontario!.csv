557921,ehg,2011-03-04 15:08:00,2666,"Aaron, very few people fish this spot mid-winter but i do so this is interesting to me. Have caught lots of big oddly timed fish there mid winter like chinook, pike, and the walleye in my avatar. The possibility of a big wiper increases the excitement. Searched the stocking records for striper/wiper in Great Lakes but found nothing. http://www.glfc.org/fishstocking/exactsearch.htm  Kind of mysterious this catch as well. Thanks for bringing it to attention."
563368,YakDreams,2011-03-19 15:43:00,3,"lurker here.  One thing I've often wondered. If you look at the satellite view on Google maps you can see a canal connecting Lake O with the mighty Hudson which is an awesome striper river. ....just a thought, not sure if they'd come this far...  Neil"
557248,Aaron Shirley,2011-03-02 21:04:00,655,"I just learned that a buddy caught a 15lb Wiper on Lake Ontario in January! He sent me the photos and story, very cool! I didn't even know there were wipers in Lake Ontario until now.  Here is a link to the whole story, enjoy: Giant Wiper Caught on Lake Ontario"
557250,mercman,2011-03-02 21:09:00,7054,Awesome story about an awesome fish.Mother nature is umpredictable indeed  
557251,asdve23rveavwa,2011-03-02 21:10:00,2690,"What a great story, and, I can just imagine the excitement on that boat!"
557255,Grimace,2011-03-02 21:18:00,2020,That is awesome.   I would have loved to see that Lake Trout. Very cool story
557259,Rod Caster,2011-03-02 21:25:00,5784,Very cool story. Imagine beating the white bass record by over 12lbs! It must be like catching a 15lbs crappie.
557260,Aaron Shirley,2011-03-02 21:25:00,655, Lake trout? What story did you read? lol
557264,Grimace,2011-03-02 21:28:00,2020,He got to see the world record lake trout at the museum. It was preserved.  He was given a tour of the museum when he dropped the wiper off.
557267,kickingfrog,2011-03-02 21:31:00,8333,Never mind.
557268,Grimace,2011-03-02 21:37:00,2020,"Sorry for the confusion.   The ""that's awesome"" and ""very cool story"" comments were for the Wiper.  The Lake Trout comment was for the museum."
557272,Roy,2011-03-02 21:42:00,13728,Dang....striper and wipers are a protected species all the way up the St Lawrence. They're not once in Lake O? I got some reading to do I guess.
557275,d_paluch,2011-03-02 21:47:00,343,wicked fish! I caught one...but I think it was a white bass..and was only about 4/5 inches long
557277,Jacob,2011-03-02 21:48:00,186,Great story. That's an awesome fish!
557281,beginner,2011-03-02 21:52:00,542,wow that is a beast!.. good story...
557283,Joey,2011-03-02 21:54:00,9122,"Wow, that's too cool!"
557315,camillj,2011-03-02 23:11:00,1988,wow .. ya just never know what Lake O gods will serve up !!!
557350,pikehunter,2011-03-03 00:39:00,1659,Fantastic!  Never heard of a Wiper before.
557356,vinnimon,2011-03-03 01:01:00,2593,Thats one giant whopper of a wiper  
557374,Joeytier,2011-03-03 01:51:00,3990,I usually hear of one or two of those getting caught out there every winter.  What a PIG
557384,ehg,2011-03-03 02:10:00,2666,"I think i know where that fish was caught and have fished there very often over the years. You have to launch a small tinny off a beach to get there at best time when all launches are frozen over. Over the years have caught everything there mid- winter, atlantics, chinook, rainbows, pike, largies, smallies, walleye, all the coarse species but mainly browns and white bass.Have even seen a 30 lb musky caught there. The white bass are like this one Dude caught.  A wiper of that size being caught in L.Ontario freaks me out. Never heard of striped bass in the lake where did this come from?  I have to get past my disability and get out there next winter.  WOW! Thanks for post."
557431,JoshS,2011-03-03 04:29:00,729,Very cool!!!
557437,Bob Devine,2011-03-03 05:56:00,251,"The Ont record Wiper was caught on the Detroit River 21 lbs http://www.ontariofishing.net/fishrecords.html Temperate Bass Hybrid 21.18 30.0 25.0 5/14/2006 Salvatore Oddo Algonac, Michigan Detroit River Lead Jig  Looking at the numbers 3 record fish have come out of the Detroit River."
557438,hawk-eye,2011-03-03 07:14:00,141,"Fantastic fish, congrats on the catch."
557582,ehg,2011-03-03 19:05:00,2666,Where did the wiper come from? Do some states stock them in the Great Lakes?
557627,jimmer,2011-03-03 21:41:00,2730,Does this mean that there are stipers in Lake O?
557882,Aaron Shirley,2011-03-04 13:07:00,655,"Hey Bob, my buddy did find out about that Ontario record from the DR. What a beast. He was disappointed when he heard, but his fish is still a great fish and very rare. Thanks for the info, I only knew about the record, I wasn't aware that other wipers were caught in the Detroit River. Bob, do you know how prevalent wipers are on the DR? Did Michigan stock wipers on the DR or a connecting watershed?  As for your question Egh, I have no idea! I didn't know wipers even existed in the Great lakes until now. I would like to know more about the Detroit wipers myself if several have been caught in the DR.  I know the white bass population on the Great Lakes is prevalent, but haven't heard of wipers until my buddy's catch. I was speaking with Marc Thorpe the past couple days, and he informed me that stripers have been re-introduced into the St.Lawrence River the past 5 years and are protected in the St.Lawrence. It's possible that a stray striper got into Lake O and got it's freak on with a white bass? In Marc's words, it could have been interracial sex hahaha. Got that this morning, thanks for that one Marc, still laughing  Another possibility is that a wiper migrated from the Detroit River? I don't know how prevalent wipers are in the DR? One thing I do know, is that wipers are very rare in Lake Ontario. If I had caught that beast, I would have thought it was a white bass as well. A striper or wiper would not have even been a thought.. until now!"
