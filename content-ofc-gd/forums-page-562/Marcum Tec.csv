562477,Terry,2011-03-16 19:32:00,14456,"I broke the plug end of my Marcum color underwater camera it was totally my fault and well past warranty I emailed them to get a part number and to find out where/if I could buy a replacement part  Well they were quick to answer the email and asked me for my shipping address as they were going to ship me the part  for free  even free shipping  they sure didn't have to do that, but they did  my hat is off to them. great service and I would say the best color underwater camera on the market today  I am a happy camper thanks Marcum  we need more companies to follow their lead"
562479,DRIFTER_016,2011-03-16 19:38:00,10439,Last year I had to send in my LX-5 for an issue and also had great service from them.    :good:

562489,Terry,2011-03-16 20:06:00,14456,what of breaking things..LOL what are you saying....LOL
562495,misfish,2011-03-16 20:23:00,29133, Now that right there is funny.  He even breaks pedistal seats too.
562497,icefisherman,2011-03-16 20:24:00,952,"Yes Terry,  Marcum has been well known for their great products and for top customer service as well. Couple years ago I dropped and broke the charger for my LX-5 ...called them, told them the story, asked where can I buy new one......same thing they asked for my address and sent me a new charger free of charge and free of shipping charges too.... Can't ask for much more from a company.  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
562503,crappieperchhunter,2011-03-16 20:50:00,2582,Thx for posting this Terry. Someday I'm going to upgrade from my Vex FL8...and things like this really have me thinking about going Marcum next time.  After the brutal/none existent customer service I just experienced with bass pro in Vaughn it is nice to hear a GOOD customer service story.
562505,misfish,2011-03-16 20:56:00,29133," Let me know when you do Steve. Im sure a Tims card wont do though, Im sure."
562522,crappieperchhunter,2011-03-16 21:38:00,2582,I'll keep you in mind Brian. When I part with my stuff I figure I have gotten my use out of it and my moneys worth...so I usually don't try to get rich. A Tim's card just might be the ticket.
562648,Tdel,2011-03-17 13:37:00,393,I also had a great experience with Marcum customer service. The Marcum product I bought was missing a part and after contacting Marcum customer service the item was at my door step two days later. Takes longer than that for me to send a letter to Hamilton.
