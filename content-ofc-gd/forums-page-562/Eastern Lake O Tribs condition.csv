562568,esoxansteel,2011-03-17 00:50:00,1307,"  Went 1 for 3 with 3 inches visibility, and more rain came just as I left, fishing was slow on the trib I was on, with my fish coming from pocket water, and runs, ganny was even dirtier, and almost totalled when I left their, with floating grass and branches starting to come down the river. Should have went west but thats another day"

Kidding around, but all the rivers/creeks clear out different.  You HAVE to have a look for yourself.  My fishable water may be different then yours."
