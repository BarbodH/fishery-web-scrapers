Its 40$ to walk in the door, and I personally prefer to spend that on some tackle. I will give Le Baron some credit for the $2 off. Ill definatly be at the BPS Classic next weekend."

562076,wayne,2011-03-15 18:59:00,6, Nice!  I can see why that $19 has become a trigger issue for sure! Sounds like the sportman show is going to have to reinvent itself or BPS competitors are going to have to find a better way to market themselves. Do the OFNers get together @ the BPS classic? Would love to meet a few of yoyu experienced cats at the show!
562909,John Bacon,2011-03-18 03:31:00,3277," OFAH did pay the rent on the hatchery for five years and spent money improving the wells.  Yes, they didn't do everything they way MEA would have liked but let's not lose sight of the fact that they have provided significant funds towards the hatchery over the last five years.  The Sportsman Show has also provided funding to the hatchery.  I am not sure of the exact figure provided to the hatchery but I believe they have made over $35 million in donations to various causes since the beginning of the show."
562911,HTHM,2011-03-18 03:40:00,4082,"Thats only because we can't tie the noose fast enough..... But then again, I'm so far out of the loop, I didn't even see the rope"
560801,Ron,2011-03-11 22:03:00,1683,"It will be option #2 for me. If I can't get out fishing somewhere, I'll be more than happy to spend my 20 + 10 (split on parking) for a day of entertainment. I will look forward to watching the dog shows, speaking to the reps on their new products, look at new product. If I am lucky, I will be able to compare products without having to go to several different places. I don't ever plan on going to these places to expect a deal... on tackle. If I was in the market for a boat, ATV or some other big ticket item, then yes I would expect a deal. To say the show is a rip off, you are right, best for you not to go as you will only get in the way of people who really want to spend the time on learning how to be more successful angling, hunting, etc... To say there are no deals to be found, how about you buy more than 20.00 - 50.00 worth of product from one vendor. I know I will be putting about 500.00 - 800.00 into someones till.  Cheers, Ron..."
560814,DRIFTER_016,2011-03-11 22:35:00,10439,  Don't forget the sausage and sunglass vendors.

560829,ah_long,2011-03-11 23:35:00,354,lebaron would be starting their no tax sale tomorrow.. it's worth noting that they will have the Shimano Symetre FJ/RJ marked down to $75... picked up the 1000 and 3000FJ already
560832,chessy,2011-03-11 23:41:00,610,are they not the same ???

560958,ld17,2011-03-12 04:17:00,319,I stopped going years ago.  It seems more and more there is less to do with fishing and hunting and more to do with all other out door sports.  The price to get in and park is to much for me.  If you can afford to go have fun.
560962,ah_long,2011-03-12 04:44:00,354," can't do, it's a special hence you can't stack the no tax"
561036,Live2fish85,2011-03-12 14:41:00,1633,Yea I have been going with my grandfather also my fishing mentor. But since they have been asking as much plus parking and walking to far is out of the question for him so we wold likely pay 20 dollars on top for parking. We don't go anymore I do miss it. But I still get out fishing with him lots.

So maybe if you know your admission fee is going towards helping outdoor sports, it may not be as difficult to part with $19.00."
561104,Billy Bob,2011-03-12 17:44:00,5865," If that is true, then at $19 per head, it sounds like a VERY high price...."

561144,Live2fish85,2011-03-12 19:37:00,1633,"Yea kinda sounds like they just want more money for there pockets, any non profit organization takes alot out of it. When the Tsunami hit Thailand and surrounding areas I seen on a Documentary that Red Cross only shipped a quarter of what was donated I can't remember the amount it was still a lot donated but where the other three quarters went is well hidden in pockets I bet. Kinda sad that some people can be selfish like that. I understand people need to make money but some of them are living the high life and don't want to truly help any one but there pockets."

Ya, boat and RV dealers can afford it but the little guys cant anymore. Which brings me to this,,,,,,,,,,,,,Why isnt BPS there? Why does LaBarons hold a no tax event during the show? Hell LaBarons was always at the entrance of the show.NO MORE. SHAKE YER HEAD. One can walk throught the show in an hour or so.Heck I walked through the spring show in 3 hours.Ya did it 3 times,just looking to meet other OFNER,S.Tickets were free or else I wouldnt of been attending.I know I keep saying ""BACK WHEN"" but that was when the show was the show.ENTERTANMENT.Ya spelt it wrong.  nough said."

561227,OrangePeal,2011-03-13 00:04:00,37,Don't ask me how much but I know that they have been donating to Ringwood Hatchery to help out operations.  Jack
561231,chessy,2011-03-13 00:15:00,610, we had that discussion already  one member from that group came on here and told us they screwed the feed up and made them join a orgnization they had been vollenteering for years but had to join a group .. they begged the organization to buy differnt feed . they ended up takeing money out of there own pocket to buy feed... oh ya that organization charged them a  handling fee to pay for the food .... non profit my ass
561294,canadadude,2011-03-13 04:06:00,769,"your confusing the Sportsmen Show Corp with OFAH, the Sportsman Show corp only provides grants. They have supported Ringwood with grant money also Orillia Perch Festivals, Kids fishing Days and Credit River Angler Association just to name a few. If you have an event and wish to apply for a grant you can do it on there web site, who knows they may help you out.  The OFAH is the group your refering to in your post not the Sportsman Show corp, they are two completly different identities"
561331,chessy,2011-03-13 13:50:00,610,you are correct . but are they not partners in alot of these things. ???  if you hang around dirt dont you become dirt???  i will call monday morning and get there finacial statement for 2010 as it should be open because they are non profit . and if i am wrong i will be the first to oppologize
561346,MJL,2011-03-13 15:27:00,2427,My dad and I will be going again this year. I get off work at 5 so we'll be doing the after 5pm for $5.  I work downtown anyway so travel and parking isn't an issue.  The only thing I really want to get down there is a spool of Raven mono. We'll mostly just be going down for a walk and to pick up some free sausage and smoked meat samples

560467,BUSTER,2011-03-11 01:40:00,1336,not going
560468,mercman,2011-03-11 01:42:00,7054," I'm with you on this Bob. With the internet, and WFN, you can stay up to date on the innovations in the industry, right in your own living room.Plus, with all the major sporting stores syncing their sales around these shows,there is really no reason to attend them either. I saw no real bargains at the montreal show a few weeks ago, and will not be going back next year."
560469,chessy,2011-03-11 01:42:00,610,saying this tounge in cheek... come on guys come out to suport a not for profit corparation . the cnss is not for profit.. but they went corporation so you cant see where they spend there money
560470,MCTFisher9120,2011-03-11 01:42:00,3761,  Haha
560472,ColdH20guy,2011-03-11 01:44:00,312, this makes no sense?
560478,MCTFisher9120,2011-03-11 01:49:00,3761, Non profit doesn't mean they don't take the money to pay for things...like the event. You can not simple put a excuse on it to spend the $20 for the show and as other's said 10 or 15 for parking on top of that. Gouging the price because they have people attend so they know they will pay. I suspect a drop in attendance this year and a price drop next year.  I guarantee.
560486,bigugli,2011-03-11 02:00:00,6138,"Some of the regular tackle shops are not going to be there either. Just means more space for the T-shirt, first aid and sock vendors."
560494,beertech,2011-03-11 02:07:00,118,Yeah i heard grimsby tackle and fishing world are not going this year.  Myself i prefer the spring sales at the local shops anyways  
560517,mercman,2011-03-11 02:57:00,7054,  The only tackle retailer we had this year in Montreal was LeBarons. No Sail or any of the other great shops we have locally. I think the cost of booths plus declining attendance is keepinu the bigger players away. I did notice that there was a booth where they were selling Tupperware and bed sheets Figure that one out. At least the cost was only 13 bucks for tickets.
560525,Roy,2011-03-11 03:09:00,13728," Paul, you'll never see Le Baron and Sail (Baron Sport) in the same building. You've got to know the history of those two companies. We'll talk about that sometime."
560533,kickingfrog,2011-03-11 03:26:00,8333," This year and last it has moved to the metro convention centre on front street. No free parking, but it is on the transit line and GO.   There is a family pass depending on how old, and how many, ""children"" you have."
560534,bigugli,2011-03-11 03:26:00,6138,"I can date my visits to the Sportsman show back into the late 60's.  Several years back, the Sportsman show was a different creature. There were a lot more mom and pop lodges, tackle shops, small independent manufacturers, etc... at the show. The mezzanine was all small retailers back then. Gradually, the small vendors, and some of the larger ones, were all pushed out by the big dollar. Seems there is not that much that is centered on fishing and camping."
560535,BillM,2011-03-11 03:29:00,17367,"I remember the days when it used to be held on Dixon Rd at the International Center.  That was always a great trip with the oldman when I was a kid.  So much stuff you could barely take it in during a single day.  Now it's just more floor space with less vendors, reminds me more of a car show then a fishing show.  No thanks."
560544,fishdawg,2011-03-11 03:47:00,912,"no thanks i prefer local small town shows and tackle shop  ""open house"" sales instead"

And what an insult, you have to pay almost as much to get your car in the gate as it costs for yourself...and your car didn't even ask to go!  Loved it as a kid and a teen, it was an indicator to the end of winter too, but not at that price!   I'm in my fifties and only remember it being at the CNE, never on Dixon Rd., sure you're not thinking of the fishing show?"
560590,solopaddler,2011-03-11 12:04:00,8605,I avoid the spotsmans show like the plague for all the reasons mentioned.  However....this year I'll be helping out Eddie at his Attawpiskat River Adventures booth.  If anyone does happen to be going stop by and say hello.
560600,Randy,2011-03-11 12:49:00,115," The Lebaron coupon does say that photocopies not accepted, I assume therefore you must get one directly from Lebaron and not proint one out off their website. This this correct?  BTW, doesn't Lebaron normally have a no tax sale at Sportsman Show time?"
560608,SmokestackLightnin,2011-03-11 13:34:00,390," Exactly what Charles said.  The Convention Centre sucks for large shows, especially when they have it in the two areas.  I think last year we looked at all the displays in one area then we walked, took a street car, went down 4 escalators, grabbed a cab and finally took a rickshaw and made it to the second area."
560612,Grimace,2011-03-11 13:42:00,2020,  That made me laugh.  My father and I went by Caravan.  Camels get really cranky when they are hungary.

I kinda want to go, but yeah the $40 to set foot in the place (+parking) drains the excitement for me.  If it's any consolation, the Hot dog vendor outside serves up some of the best sausages and fries ever  Still on the fence about going...."
560690,Bernie,2011-03-11 17:33:00,3190,It's been a long time since the last sportsman show I was to.  If it is any worse than the last one they should pay you to go.

560722,Roy,2011-03-11 19:00:00,13728, It's called the Loose Moose.

Ya right  It was $10 just for my slice of pizza and pop on top of that. I'll spend that $$ on lures at BPS during the classic."
560340,adempsey,2011-03-10 19:53:00,1498,"Wow, that does seem like a lot.  If you don't go for the seminars and other events you're definitely better off going after 5PM when it's $5.  At that price, I really think they should include a bunch of free raffle tickets or something at least since not everyone goes to the events."

I parked at Yorkdale Mall and lied to the parking lot monitors - the mall ain't open early in the morning so tell em you're going to the Tim Hortons - and took subway down from there.  I got in to the show for free thanks to a friend with a booth there.  I still felt ripped off.  lol  In my opinion, the better deal is the BPS Classic - it has free parking, free entrance, better speakers, better deals and the mall is nice for the family.  Then again, $19 for a day of exercise and entertainment isn't that bad when you consider a movie is like $13-$14 for 90 minutes or so.  All just my personal opinion of course.  Charles"
560444,Snidley,2011-03-11 00:27:00,620,I never go anymore but when I did go i found that there is free parking at Ontario Place just acros the Lakeshore Rd. . A short hike up and over the bridge for sure but I like walking and $15 to park and $19 to get in is a no go for me. Come to think of it $19 is a no go period.
560446,wanafish,2011-03-11 00:34:00,3,I have not missed A Toronto Sportsmen show in many years as I was involved one way or another with the Gold Whistle.  For me to go with my family would be about $75.00 just to get in the door.Plus gas plus a beer and a slice of pizza we are easily into a 150.00 dollar day. So I think I will go to BPS or better yet somewhere local to spend $150.00 or maybe more..I really dislike BPS but the guest speakers maybe worth the trip...
