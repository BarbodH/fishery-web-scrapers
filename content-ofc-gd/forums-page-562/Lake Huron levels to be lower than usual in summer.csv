Powerful storms early in the winter drew a lot of moisture off of Lake Huron, said Bryan MacKenzie, Commodore of the Sarnia Yacht Club: “Water levels do look low. Certainly, lower than normal, I would say.”  The club must dredge the main passage from its harbour to Lake Huron each spring, an operation that’s impacted by water levels and requires permission from 12 regulatory agencies, he said.  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ most recent forecast predicts the depth Lake Huron could decrease seven to 12 inches from last summer’s 569 feet (173 m).
