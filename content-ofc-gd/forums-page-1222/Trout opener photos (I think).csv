He floats with roe most of the time and I usually use spinners, plugs and spoons. For steelhead he out fishes me most of the time, but I like fishing by feel and spend too much time looking around to watch my float properly anyway. We had the typical early start, spooked a wild turkey out of its roost and had another fly overhead as my brother was fighting his first fish.  So it looks like I've figured out how to manage the photo size to upload, but are there some tips on how to improve the picture quality assuming the original photo(s) were good?  I don't think I'll get out this weekend: Saturday wedding, Sunday visiting relatives.   "
