67834,Terry,2007-05-04 16:07:00,14456,but that question is will there be OFNcommunity  stickers and what not or do we go with the OFC site stuff?
67837,Hookset,2007-05-04 16:12:00,367,I ordered and received mine within a week. Got some for my boat / Jeep. Good quality. Use the soapy water method to adhere them. It's all good. Oh ya. Got a hat too but it didn't make me any prettier.  Hookset.
