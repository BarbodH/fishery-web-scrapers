67507,HookNrelease,2007-05-03 20:24:00,85,anyone drive or driven a Yukon XL with the 5.8L and have any input as to actual gas mileage? looking at a used one for moving the boat and kids around:) cheers ian
67518,Terry,2007-05-03 20:48:00,14456,if you have to ask you can'...............lol  about 11c/15 h mpg...us gal.  at best
67519,1leggedangler,2007-05-03 20:49:00,364,$75.00 to $85.00 to fill and around 400 to 425 km's depending on city or highway. Thirsty girls but a nice ride.
67527,spanky,2007-05-03 21:35:00,195,"makes me appreciate my neon, 35L gets me 500km..... too bad i can't even tow an empty trailer with it lol  yep, my quality of posts are lacking"
67546,Fisherman,2007-05-03 22:08:00,7201,"5.8L eh?  I've heard of a 4.8, 5.3, 6.0 and the 8.1  Unless someone grafted a Ford to a GM"
67581,irishfield,2007-05-03 23:25:00,26272,5.7 litre = a 350 CU in GMC  And 1legs about right with a mix of highway and city. Strictly highway...my trip to Ottawa from Penetang and back out to Carleton Place last Thursday... $93 & 1.05/litre...in my Sierra. Same running gear/weight etc as the Yukon.  ..and what Terry said.
67597,JerseyDog,2007-05-04 00:05:00,190,Horrific.
67687,mikeymikey,2007-05-04 07:16:00,376,"if you are thinking about buying a SUV like yukon i am sure you have no problem paying for gas  right?  Ooops, sorry you were asking about milage.  sorry."
67697,Marc Thorpe,2007-05-04 09:56:00,621,  Does your Neon come in 4X 4 or 1X1
67742,Fish Farmer,2007-05-04 12:00:00,2234,"I have a 96 Tahoe 5.7 and I get 21 miles to the ca gallon (HWY) just got back from Orillia pulling the boat, 4 guys and back loaded with eq. up and back from Hamilton $70.00 for gas at a $1.03 litre. I don't want to know city . I figure thats petty good."
67748,spanky,2007-05-04 12:10:00,195," 1x2 of course, splurged for the extra option you know... can go mudding in it, but the underside of it hits everything and it gets stuck easy... got rid of them stupid creature comforts too, like power window and locks, tilt steering...  but i still get 500km to a tank and i'm happy about the 30mpg+ i get on it, especially while the gas companies have ass all bent over the hoods of our vehicles!!"
67818,Steve,2007-05-04 15:01:00,2075,"From the time my Yukon (2003) was driven off the lot, until this morning into work, it takes an average gas consumption.  As of today, it is at 16.8L per 100K.  Hopefully that gives you an idea....it averages and factors in towing, city driving, and highway driving (non towing)....  Use it as an approx estimate."
67822,Squid,2007-05-04 15:28:00,1656,Mine gets 23MPG pulling the boat. Keep it under 2000 RPMS and it will suck less gaz.
67845,lookinforwalleye,2007-05-04 16:57:00,4399, 21 MPG that`s impressive for that beast I can`t get that towing with my 6 cylinder Explorer heck I am hard pressed to get that without the boat on the back.  Any driving tips?
