64634,outdoorguy61,2007-04-25 16:49:00,220,"Personally, I would opt for the Bancroft area as my own suggestion. It is generally reasonable in price and has many fishing options.  outdoorguy61"

Chain of 3 lakes.....nice beach, floating raft, nice pub with pool table. I have a cottage 10 mins away, and I spend more time fishing elephant than I do on my own lake!  Sinker"

68027,wolfville,2007-05-05 05:29:00,396,"Kashaga Lodge on Kashagawigamog 5 min from downtown Haliburton. Ken will treat you good. Good fishing for pickeral right off the dock at night, good fishing for LMB and SMB in a canoe, also supposedly good for muskie (we only managed a small one, but that's not what we intended to target anyway).  And the price is very reasonable with convenient location. We have gone there two years in a row, will likely go back there again this year."
