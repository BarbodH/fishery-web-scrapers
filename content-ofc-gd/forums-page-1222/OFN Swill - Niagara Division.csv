I was sure that I had met John before, asked him if he knew Buoy Benson.  ""That was me on the old board!!""  Okay,  okay, so I had talked to him at a couple of Swills in Oakville!    That was a long time ago!  He seemed just as nice as Buoy Benson     It was also a real pleasure meeting your much better half John.  You've got the green light, now get out there and buy that boat!! It was great to see Joe Fish and son Alex.  Funny, last time I saw him was the night I sold my last boat Hawg2.  Tonight I meet him again after just selling Hawg3.  See you in four or five years Joe! It was great to finally have a good chinwag with Tracker (Don).  Sonny is a class act and was great meeting him tonight.  Also found out he was Jen's brother!!  Sorry we didn't get much chance to talk Jen.  And last but not least good ole Loonietoon.  Nice seeing you again Kelvin.  Geez haven't seen you since............last Saturday. If anybody's ears were ringing its probably because we were talking about you.  Took this picture of Tracker so everybody would know what he looked like!   Jen, Loonietoon, Sonny, moi, Joe Fish, John's wife (dang I'm no good with names, sorry), Joe's son Alex, Tracker, John and Jen's friend (did I say I'm no good with names, sorry)   And reverse order....   We'll have to do it again in the fall!"

67661,Dondorfish,2007-05-04 02:15:00,1000,"I had a great time! But Roger - think there might be something wrong with your camera - really makes my hair look grey! Was nice to get to meet Joefish and his son, sonny, loonietoon, John and his wife, and to see Jen again - she has a million dollar smile!  And Roger - well what can I say - never dull when he's around! Thanks for organizing such a great night for all of us.  And I agree - chicken wings were great - havta say - they beat the firehall!  Took a few pictures - but I played with the camera and screwed up my settings, so they aren't that good:   Joefish and son    John and his wife ( sorry John - next time say cheese! )     And the 3 stooges ( had the rest of us in tears ) Loonietoon, Sonny, And the man himself - Roger    And last but not least - Jen   Thanks again all - I had a great time and can't wait for the next one!!!  Don"
