67496,kickingfrog,2007-05-03 19:45:00,8333,"I came across this board about a week ago while looking for some fishing information.  My story is not much different than most of yours, I'm sure. I've fished all my life and many of my best memories are about or formed around fish, fishing, and fishing trips. While I'll angle for just about anything and everything my budget is only so big and my time finite.  Main species targeted are small stream trout, river steelhead and salmon, walleye, pike, smallmouth and largemouth bass and pan fish. The majority of my fishing is done in and around Simcoe County, although I am from North Bay and still make it ""up there"" a few times a year. I don't fish as much as I'd like, but more than some think I should. My other hobbies/ interests are often connected to fishing: canoeing, photography, camping and birding. I'm a bit of a loner when it comes to most fishing, camping and canoeing, but my brother and I do get out quite often as well.  My wife is a great sport when it comes to my endeavours and does come along sometimes, and really enjoys herself, but she also understands my need to get out and ""be at one with nature"". Take that for what it might be worth.  I'll try to post some photos although I'm unsure about making them ""fit"" because of file size. I may be asking for some photo editing tips soon.   Rob"
