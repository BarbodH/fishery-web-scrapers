68028,Jonaton,2007-05-05 08:10:00,72,Due to time constraints i will not be able to make it to the island this Sunday. i was looking at maybe heading down to Tommy Thompson at check out the spit area. Has any one had much luck with pike down there. not asking for spots at all just about wether you have had any success. Thanks in advance for any replies and good luck to all of you heading out this weekend.
