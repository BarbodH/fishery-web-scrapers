67463,Landlocked,2007-05-03 18:15:00,171,If you owned a 17 foot Lund Pro-V and the cottage you go to for several weeks out of the year didn't have a dock what would you do...moor the boat or nose it in on the gradual sloped sandy beach?  I used to moor my little 14footer but am now a little more concerned now that I have a larger boat and a few more $$ invested!  Thanks once again!!
67465,specktacklure,2007-05-03 18:17:00,56,beach it !!you probably don't want to go swimming.I have the same scenario and recommend beaching it is just safer and more secure.
67466,Headhunter,2007-05-03 18:17:00,5703,"With that much money invested in a boat, I'd consider the following; -build a dock! -rig up a ""temporary dock"" that can be moved Not so concerned about the sandy beach, but what will happen if you do pull it up on the beach and a few boats go by and their wake fills up the back of your boat... not that I know anything about that! HH"
67470,Terry,2007-05-03 18:27:00,14456,there is an anchor system that lets you pull the boat to shore to get on or off then it springs back out away from shore..but I can't remember the name of it I am sure someone will know what I am talking about
67473,Raf,2007-05-03 18:34:00,3495,anchor buddy is what Terry is refferring to.
67477,Pigeontroller,2007-05-03 18:42:00,2793,"Consider getting your feet wet. Anchor it nose out a few feet off the beach, tie the stern in on both sides...Docks are overated, its more fun when there isn't one, assuming its sheltered from wakes/waves...  You can get an anchor buddy from Andy K. at http://www.muskystriker.com/shop/ms_shop.htm"
67478,ccmtcanada,2007-05-03 18:42:00,7971,Here's the link...looks pretty cool....  http://www.anchorbuddy.com/
67480,aplumma,2007-05-03 18:48:00,6896,I have an anchor buddy and it works really well. I also use it when the current on a river is swift but not to deep to get it to hold anchor while fishing. The bungy effect keeps the anchor from losing it hold due to wakes and stray currents.  Art
67483,Landlocked,2007-05-03 19:03:00,171,You guys are awesome...now I can sleep at night not wondering what the best solution would be!!
67499,irishfield,2007-05-03 19:55:00,26272,Andy...take some wood with you and build a set of bunks on the shore if it's deep enough. If not the anchor buddy is your best bet to keep the US bought treasure in good shape.
67737,blaque,2007-05-04 11:57:00,2419,"If i owned that boat, Id launch it, fish it, retrieve it, trailer it back to the cottage, feed it lunch..........put it in for a nap, and sing it a lullaby to make sure it felt loved LOL!"
67875,Cast-Away,2007-05-04 18:41:00,790,"I've had an Anchor Buddy for 3 years now and swear buy it. I just toss it out and it holds even in sand because the bungie cord takes up all of the shock. I tie up the boat with the bow out and tie the stern to shore. Then when I want to get the boat, I just pull in the line from shore and the anchor line goes tight.  I once anchored the boat in 3 feet of water on Lake Huron in 3 foot waves and the boat did not move at all!  Andy from Muskie Striker has a few left for sale I believe. If not, you can get them from Boater's World through their website."
67887,glen,2007-05-04 19:48:00,2641,I put a plank down and pull the bow up on it.
