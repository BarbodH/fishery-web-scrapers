66739,Gerritt,2007-05-01 23:22:00,6129,"Terry, using your computer to run a trace route is more accurate as it is your computer sending the packets.  not sure if you know how to run a traceroute or not from your pc...  Start, Run, Type in ""cmd"" and hit enter at the prompt type in ""tracert website or ip"" hit enter  It will show you from your PC to the site you want info from, which is a good thing incase your ISP is to blame.  You can also use ""ping website""  from the same command window.  if you already knew all this, my post was a waste of time  If yah didnt you know now  Gerritt."
