67814,lew,2007-05-04 14:51:00,12767,"It took me 2 minutes just to open this thread and reply to it.  I've had a problem with this new board since it started last November. All the other sights I go to are lightning fast, but some days this one is so slow I just turn it off and forget it."
67815,bigfish1965,2007-05-04 14:53:00,3382,I have contacted the hosting company and requested this issue be fixed or move us to a new server. Very unacceptable. All things on tis end are as they should be. It is very frustrating for me cause there is nothing I can do.
67819,shawnf,2007-05-04 15:05:00,46,Tell the mods to stop using the server for downloading porn!  hahahha  
67826,Raf,2007-05-04 15:39:00,3495,al gore please fix the internet!
67827,Raf,2007-05-04 15:41:00,3495,Who provides the hosting Rick??

67962,dsn,2007-05-04 23:57:00,1018,yep same here as usual. Even with all the programs cleaning out all the trash from my computer its still slow.   dsn
67972,Roy,2007-05-05 00:20:00,13728,All's much better now. Mine is almost instant response.
67987,icedude,2007-05-05 01:10:00,459,no problems here--she's a fast pussy cat!  Take a Kid Fishing  ID1
67988,tbayboy,2007-05-05 01:18:00,1497,Yep fast at home now too (was bad here even when it was good from work).  Nice job yelling at 'em Rick
68006,Gerritt,2007-05-05 02:34:00,6129,"Seems to be ok for the time being but this problem seems to be sporadic. It is definetly not ALWAYS slow... just seems to be at awkward times. it is weird... and no there is nothing any of the Mods here can do about it... other then move use to a new server...Internet slowdowns happen it is a fact of life... we refer to it as Bottle-Necking.... the sad reality is... if it is indeed a bottle neck there are only a couple of options...such as life on the internet......... wait till the host where the bottle neck is located, fixes it... reroute the way we access this site... (highly unlikely) or move the the site all together to a completely different host..  Yes it sucks when you are unable to access the mother-ship...  and as much as I gripe about how slow the site has been there is little we can can do.... unless the server is moved.... which costs $$ and results in downtime as the dns servers update etc....   lets hope it get fixed soon..  but again there is little the site admins can do...  Gerritt."
