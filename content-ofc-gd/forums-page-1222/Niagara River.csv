67685,charlied,2007-05-04 06:44:00,584,"apparently the Lakers have been pretty consistant out on the bar...from what I have heard, I have no boat so...LOL.  Rainbows are spread all over the place...they maybe mixed up with the late spring...who knows.  I would try drop shotting minnows or white tube jigs for the lakers...but you probably all ready know that...hope this helps!"
67805,tonyb,2007-05-04 14:19:00,1637,"For targetting the Steelhead in the river, you will want to use a typical 3-way rig with 3/4oz to get your offering down to the bottom, in the strike zone.  Roe, Emerald Shiners, and artificial immitations of the aforementioned will be your ticket.  For the Lake trout out at the bar you can use the same set-up, but shiners or artifical immitations of minnows in the 4"" size should be ideal.  You can also troll deep diving crankbaits and when they are ticking bottom (not dredging it) you will have an ideal presentation for the Lake trout.  I would also recommend that you get a N.Y. State fishing license so that you can fish some of the better drifts in the river that fall on the U.S. side.  Same with fishing at the Niagara Bar, you will want to be able to fish on the U.S. side as well.  It is good piece of mind to abide by the U.S. regulations, the patrol boats down there are equipped with M16's!  Tony"
