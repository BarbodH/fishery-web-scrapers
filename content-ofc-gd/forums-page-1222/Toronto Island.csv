67356,PatrickGG,2007-05-03 12:47:00,562,Center Island sits in Lake O i was just wondering would it be Section 4 or Section 8?? I am asking this question in regards to pike opener on center island.

67365,PatrickGG,2007-05-03 13:13:00,562,Thanks! I was just making sure every time i look at the map regulations its hard to determine if its 4 or 8.

67790,Guest lundboy,2007-05-04 13:48:00,0,"As a side topic still regarding Centre Islands,  are they considered part of Toronto Harbour and require a harbour License? I always wanted to give them a try, but don't want to bother having to get a harbour license.  If they aren't, where would be the best place to launch to avoid the harbour?"
