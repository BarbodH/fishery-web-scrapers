67561,Pinch,2007-05-03 22:36:00,231," The boat was probably used as a 'mothership' they troll and set the hook on the boat then get in the kayak and go for a ride.  As for no life jacket, to each his own, he does have the boat right next to him, and there is the argument that people go surfing, windsurfing, swimming, and scuba diving without life jackets and that is the norm.  Having said that I always wear mine, but thats because Im always out alone."
