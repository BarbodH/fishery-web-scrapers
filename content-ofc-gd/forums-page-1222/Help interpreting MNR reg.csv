Can anyone help me out here?  I'm trying to get out for a bit of shore fishing while I'm here visiting the area  Cheers!"
68085,irishfield,2007-05-05 15:32:00,26272,Division 16 is strictly Georgian Bay
68086,Jacques,2007-05-05 15:35:00,97,"Ah OK.  I'm guessing Ramsay Lake, here in town, is in 15 then.  That makes it crappie and perch fishin' for now sounds like!"
68087,irishfield,2007-05-05 15:44:00,26272,I don't know for sure on that. Just know 16 is GBAY.  I think you were trying to decide on whether Sudbury is 15 or 18
68088,irishfield,2007-05-05 15:50:00,26272,According the exceptions to the regs.  Ramsey Lake - City of Sudbury - McKim and Neelon Twps Division 18 Fish Sanctuary Jan1 to last day in Feb  ...so from that I'd guess 18 ! And therefore you can fish for pike if they're in there...
