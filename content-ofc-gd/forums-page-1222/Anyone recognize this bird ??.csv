Everytime I go into the yard he heads for the trees, so I had to take this picture from inside the house and shoot thru 2 windows so it's not very clear.  About the size of a robin with a totally black head, and his whole back, including the top of his tail is also black with white markings mixed in.  His entire underside including the bottom of his tail is pure white and there's a large, very vivid red patch on his chest.  He's also got a thick, heavy looking beak but I doubt it's any kind of woodpecker..  My bird identification book is up at the lake but I'm curious as to what species he is.  Any ideas ??  "
