You will either be dragging a spoon or stickbait behind your canoe, using an inline weight or three way dropper to target the 5 - 15 ft depths.  Use a long line behind you, 30 or 40 meters at least.  A sonar unit would let you find deeper fish, which you can fool with a jig and grub.  Good Luck to you on your trip."
