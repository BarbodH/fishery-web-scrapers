67505,brandon,2007-05-03 20:12:00,857,could be JP Derose? not sure tho
67525,misfish,2007-05-03 21:25:00,29133,It is our own JPD. It sure looks nice eh.
67549,charlesn,2007-05-03 22:13:00,551,That was JPD on his way to do some crappie fishin'.  He called me from the road to tell me how nice it felt to be driving to a fishing destination while I was chained to a desk with no hopes of fishing for a week or so.  He is a cruel man with a pretty boat.  Charles
