67622,moosehead,2007-05-04 01:00:00,90,"Ok since my boat has suffered some damage i am thinking of getting a new one, what do you guys think about the Lund Classic 1660 SS?  http://www.lundboats.ca/1775_1660_classic_07.html  I have always wanted a Lund boat and i guess i should have done it right the first time instead of settling for less, only live once right."
67623,irishfield,2007-05-04 01:02:00,26272,It's a great boat and some of the guys here have the exact model.  Before you jump let me know.... as I'm pretty sure my marina has a 2006 sitting in the showroom...
67627,moosehead,2007-05-04 01:11:00,90,So does the marina i was at today. Would the marina you are talking about be Temagami Marine? Maybe i should compare with the price i was quoted today.
67631,Daplumma,2007-05-04 01:13:00,1961,Check the hull for cracks before ya buy it!!Best of luck with it bud. Joe
67632,irishfield,2007-05-04 01:14:00,26272,Thats why I said before you jump...I can get you a better price than you calling them. They may have a new 2007 as well...didnt' see exactly what they brought in to meet their 2007 dealer quota as they were still wrapped.
67646,PERCHER,2007-05-04 01:34:00,787,I own a 2005 classic 16 tiller.Its the exact same boat but a tiller.I powered mine with a 50h.p Merc four stroke.They are great boats with a smooth ride do to the IPS hull.Nice and stable and handle big water well.I use mine on Lake Ontario for salmon with no problems.I highly recomend the lund classic series.You cant go wrong with a Lund.
67654,tinbanger,2007-05-04 01:52:00,1028,"we have the 1775 classic and with almost 100 hours on it year one and no complaints. Good warranty coverage as well ( replaced drivers seat , tearing at stiches) TB"
67658,Mike the Pike,2007-05-04 02:06:00,3421,I am fishing in one this weekend a very nice boat.Stable smooth IPS hull lots of room a good bang for the buck .Too bad they didn't have them when I bought my Lund.  MTP          Wish I had one.
67673,krawler,2007-05-04 03:44:00,167,I was considering the classic but went with the Alaskan SS.  the classic seems to have less room inside due to the casting deck and rear storage space and console.  hull is stronger on the alaskan and alaskan is a little cheaper.  i went with a yamaha 75hp.  either or both boats are great!!
67691,lew,2007-05-04 08:36:00,12767,"It looks like a good boat, but do yourself a favor now before you order it,  and step up to the 1775 with the larger corresponing motor......probably a 115 ??  It'll be a few $$$$ more initially, but a year from now you'll be thanking yourself you made the jump.  There's a HUGE difference between a 16 and a 17, without too much difference in $$$$"
67695,Greencoachdog,2007-05-04 09:20:00,8163,"I was thinking the same thing Lew, it's amazing how much difference another foot or so makes in boating comfort.  Ya can't go wrong with a console!"
67719,silveradosheriff,2007-05-04 11:09:00,1025,Nice Boat for sure - you may want to consider a model with a wider beam though.
67725,Mike the Pike,2007-05-04 11:35:00,3421,  The 1660 has an 84 inch beam and the 1775 has an 85 inch beam plenty wide my Lund SSV has a 73 inch beam and it is plenty.These boats are very roomy for there size.  MTP
67738,silveradosheriff,2007-05-04 11:57:00,1025,"73 inch beam, that's cute."
67743,Mike the Pike,2007-05-04 12:03:00,3421,  Oh I forgot to mention my boat is 18.5ft long  Is that cute?
67749,silveradosheriff,2007-05-04 12:11:00,1025,"I'm sure it is a fine vessel.  I was simply offering my opinion that Moosehead may want to consider a wider boat, not that a 84"" beam is problematic.  Anytime you can add some length or some width, it is a good thing.  "
67763,tinbanger,2007-05-04 12:34:00,1028,"1775 max hp is 90.  Plenty HP for what we use it for . 43 mph top speed.  Good for tubing and sking as well .I'm 6'2"" and 220 lbs ,pulls me on skis no problem.  TB"
