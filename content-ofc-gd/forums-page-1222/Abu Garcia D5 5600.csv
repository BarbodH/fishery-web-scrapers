I have bought Ambassadeur Reels since the 50's (the old red 5000) and have not been disappointed with them, but I was disappointed with  this reel.  I had a number of backlashes, since it did not have Mechanical brake to prevent overruns.  It only has the magnetic brake or""Smart Mag"", which has very little effect on the spool and adjusting for the weight of the lure.  I could not recomend this reel, even on sale.  Abu Garcia advertise this reel as ""the World's Easiest Baitcast Reel"", which is false advertising.  I still have my old red 5000 and still works a good as it did 50+ years ago.  That is a good solid reel."
