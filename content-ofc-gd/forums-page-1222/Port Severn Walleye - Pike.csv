I have fished it in the summer for smallies and the occasional pike, but I was wondering if walleye and or pike come up to the locks to spawn this time of year.  Has anybody fished it this time of year ? any info appreciated ? THANKS"

67637,irishfield,2007-05-04 01:21:00,26272,I was just gonna say...watch the sanctuary..but went to read the regs first. What do they call that area Andy...cause it ain't listed under Georgian Bay

67660,jdmls,2007-05-04 02:10:00,575,I dunno. To me it looks like its in the right section. Guess I am gonna have to call the ministry tomorrow to find out for sure. Hey AZULUSPOOKED What's this about from under the bridge ( i assume the 400) to the locks is a sanctuary ??? 
67663,irishfield,2007-05-04 02:21:00,26272,"I guess three lads that have fished Gbay, out of the sound area, for over 20 years could very well be wrong...but better cautious than fined! I think the 69/400 bridge is to div 16/4 kinda like the railroad tracks are to Lake O and it's tribs. The locks would make more sense,,,but....."
67664,jdmls,2007-05-04 02:29:00,575," Good point, you guys are probably right ...."
67667,irishfield,2007-05-04 02:33:00,26272,Call the Midhurst office and find out for sure. Could be urban myth...  705-725-7614  It is the perfect spawning ground in there though...moving water and shallow...so MNR may have taken that into consideration when drawing the line years ago.
67775,Guest gbfisher,2007-05-04 13:26:00,0, Yes........... Try the Phone!    HEY MARTY!!...How's them bevies goin down!!??
