67455,crappiesteve,2007-05-03 17:58:00,220,"Nice looking Jigs Brian,and how many do you have :dunnoThet would work for any other fish as well.I could see a huge Walleye on one right now.  Steve"
67462,misfish,2007-05-03 18:14:00,29133,It just got out there Steve. Just another bait for you guys to throw around.LOL
67467,GbayGiant,2007-05-03 18:20:00,1780,"Do they come in 11"", lol, still to small for me.  Perfect for Pike though."
67468,Terry,2007-05-03 18:25:00,14456,"Available in 12"" (Shadzilla) and 9"" (Shadzilla Jr)  The soft plastic Shadzilla can be use for trolling or casting. The tail action has a very unique action. Rather than the normal side to side movement you might normally see on a pogy tail style swimbait, the Shadzilla tail actually rotates and causes the body to roll back and forth mimicking a swimming baitfish. We also produce the 7"" version without a jighead.  12"" Shadzilla - $16.99 9"" Shadzilla - $10.99   will that do"

67547,crappiesteve,2007-05-03 22:08:00,220,"Brian,the thought never crossed my mind bud.  Steve"
67564,misfish,2007-05-03 22:42:00,29133,"Yea I know Steve.Sorry bud,just had a moment and I withdrawed my comment."
67592,Rizzo,2007-05-03 23:48:00,4754,"look yummy.  Remember to have a flame thrower of some sort to re-attach tail after first chomp, otherwise makes for a pricy disposable bait."
