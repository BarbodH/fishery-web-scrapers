67336,JEREMY,2007-05-03 12:07:00,300,The second fish it looks like you guys were really happy with.All that white stuff on it.lol Way to go as usual.
67355,ccmtcanada,2007-05-03 12:46:00,7971,Scott...wow...I'd consider 6 a great day...esp how spooky and picky they are right now!!  All those fish have great colouring...it's amazing how fast they go back to those colours after the spawn is done.  You are right about the rain though....need some colour in the water!!
67395,tonyb,2007-05-03 13:50:00,1637,"Nothing worse than having them jump and show themselves to you like that.  It is difficult when the water is that clear, the fish can see you almost as easily as you can see them.  Do I sense a night report coming from you soon Scott?  Tony"

67475,Paulus,2007-05-03 18:38:00,522,All those fish are refugees from upriver anyway. They even see your float & they freak. Know the spot well. Good on you that you got into some!    p.-
