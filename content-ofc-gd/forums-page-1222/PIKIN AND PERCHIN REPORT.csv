67423,snagmaster,2007-05-03 16:20:00,250,"Hey guys its been a while since i posted a report because ive been busy at school but with summer vacation in full swing im back on the water. Finished school last wednsday and since then went out for perch on simcoe twice and out for Pike once......All three days were non stop action ....I love the spring   The first day of perchin was great and we boated over 60 perch and atleast 25 of them were over 11inches ,the biggest being close to 14.  The second day of perchin the action was even better and close to a hundred in three hours and atleast fifty were over 10 inches, we caught a couple that were 13.  Went out yesterday for some pike. It was a beautiful day but a bit windy . The fish were biting thats for sure but i was rusty on the hook set. I went 8 for 14 on mr pike....OUCHHHH. my buddy andrew caught one pike and four huge bass hunting for the toothy criters......In total we boated 9 pike and six huge bass in the process. Dont wurry they were released boatside as they are out of season and on there beds. The biggest pike was 31 inches and we only caught one under twenty eight....not bad Me with a pike about eight pounds  Another one about the same size   It was a great couple days on the water and it will only get better as the water temps climb"
67428,steverowbotham,2007-05-03 16:29:00,1800,"congrats on the perch, but i hope you realize that pike season is still closed for another 9 days, assuming you were fishing Simcoe.  check your regs, or post where you were fishing, because pike is still closed in most parts of Ontario."
67430,tonyb,2007-05-03 16:35:00,1637,Here we go again  Tony
67431,snagmaster,2007-05-03 16:38:00,250,you have to read your regs ....lol .....pike opens on gbay May 1st....lol ....
67433,irishfield,2007-05-03 16:42:00,26272,He didn't say he went out on Simcoe for pike...and that sure doesn't look like Simcoe landscape....Hopefully I'm right. Pike is open on GBay!  Beat me snag...I knew you knew what you wuz doin.
67435,Raf,2007-05-03 16:45:00,3495,hows about we don't ASSume.  Ontario's a big place.
67436,steverowbotham,2007-05-03 16:46:00,1800,"sorry dude, you had mentioned Simcoe in the post and I misread it.  Just trying to keep the fishing legit know what i mean.  Nice pike though man."
67442,Terry,2007-05-03 17:19:00,14456,"good to see people getting out but  must say I read it twice because first time I thought it said perch and pike on Simcoe but after rereading I noticed that he really didn't say where he caught the pike, but rather had  perch simcoe and pike all in the same sentence....Like many speed readers and get it wrong if you don't go back and double check.........lol nothing like getting people going on a thurs."

67593,irishfield,2007-05-03 23:51:00,26272, I haven't had great luck YET. We'll be back home unfortunately when you'll be up there. Pickeral have spawned already on Lake Temagami and Cassels Lake...so they'll be out into deeper water by the time you get up there for sure. I'm hoping they are still holding close to the spawning areas when I get up..but cant' fish'm till the 19th unfortunately.
67609,iceguy,2007-05-04 00:39:00,341,Here's a sample of some fish I caught this past week. http://video.google.ca/videoplay?docid=4847164986692447446
