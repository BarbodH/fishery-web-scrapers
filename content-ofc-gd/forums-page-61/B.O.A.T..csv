But I had a tournament this weekend and... went to plug in the bow light and the plastic receptacle snapped right through the bow lol went to fish...fished all day i personally didnt get one qualifying fish...on the way back i notice something ever so slightly seemed off, looked back...no water pumping...impeller is blown. Call my buddies to come tow. tow to the docks, go to throw in the trolling motor...to drive it to the ramp...its dead (wires somehow came loose...easy fix, opened up the panel and rewired, already done) put the boat on the trailer, go to plug it in to charge bank 3 on my charger is smoked.  good times ahahaha ?  funny when i got back for a beer at the trailer, the guys were razzing me about how bad of a day I had...i said ""i had about as bad of a day as you can have fishing...which is still a pretty damn good day"""

1031277,DanD,2018-07-17 13:00:00,2223,You do know that BOAT is an acronym for Bust Out Another Thousand.  Dan.
1031285,KawarthaAngler,2018-07-17 14:25:00,273,Sounds like your boat was struck by lightening one day when you didn't know it.
1031288,lunkerbasshunter,2018-07-17 16:03:00,2585,ouch not a fun sounding day! Hopefully next trip/Tourney is much better! Cheers

Took us about 45 minutes to troll back in, couldn't see a damn thing/bugs kicked our ass."
