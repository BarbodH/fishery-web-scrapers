1030754,captpierre,2018-07-05 21:30:00,2521,Got out just before front came in.  Thought I’d get a few. Nada. Never seen the lake so warm 
1030756,Rizzo,2018-07-05 22:01:00,4754,we were at pigeon a few summers ago and saw 82...never saw 84.5...that's a bath
1030760,cheaptackle,2018-07-05 23:04:00,849,Get that transponder moved away from the motor already!  Just kidding!  This heat wave had to have some effect sooner or later.  Michael
1030766,John Bacon,2018-07-06 01:24:00,3277,Lake Ontario was over 24 celcius on Tuesday.  Pretty much the same tempertature from Bluffers launch to 300' deep.  	The water actually felt pretty cold along the bluffs on Saturday.
1030783,fisherman7,2018-07-06 13:46:00,325,Upper Buckhorn is 80f this morning
1030791,boombap,2018-07-06 17:34:00,310,"Cold front rolling in tonight, maybe it will turn them on."
1030793,AKRISONER,2018-07-06 17:56:00,5558,anyone got an idea of where the thermocline is sitting right now up there? im guessing it breaks off after 15 feet or so right now its not that late in the season yet.
1030922,riddickulous,2018-07-10 02:26:00,27,"What is the impact of this high water temp? Warm water holds less oxygen, so the fish will either have to go deep or find vegetation like pads? Warm water should increase activity too since bass are cold blooded. Maybe the trick is to fish early mornings or late evenings."
1030925,chris.brock,2018-07-10 04:10:00,4053,"no, but from the captain's graph it looks like only the top 5' are soup warm all fish, not just bass, are cold blooded I don't know why, but early/ mid July is just a tough bite around this latitude  "
1030931,AKRISONER,2018-07-10 12:35:00,5558,ill be up fishing a tournament in that neck of the woods this weekend. with water that hot the trick is to going to be finding where that nice cool water intersects with structure. slow things down and as mentioned above try and fill the livewells early. gonna be a tough bite in the afternoon.
1030934,LeXXington,2018-07-10 13:24:00,1928,"wow, bath water is right"
1030940,grimsbylander,2018-07-10 15:17:00,3016,"I'm not sure why the concern for warm water? It's only surface temp and the largies on Pigeon will be loving it. If there is healthy weed growth, those fish will ""bake"" themselves in water as shallow as 6"". Smallies will be deeper and mostly unaffected by the surface temp. Oxygen levels play a bigger role than temperature. Cold water can hold more oxygen but because bass prefer the warmer water, they stay as long as possible up shallow. I don't care if it's 90+ degrees..if there's healthy weeds, there's active largies. I wouldn't be thinking thermocline in conjuction with a eutrophic type lake such as Pigeon."
1030951,captpierre,2018-07-10 19:17:00,2521,Temps back to around 80F.
1030953,grimsbylander,2018-07-10 20:24:00,3016,"Along with a couple cooler nights, I suspect that has something to do with wind speed and direction over the past few days as well. Breaking the surface will drop the temp."
1030954,AKRISONER,2018-07-10 20:50:00,5558,85 is an issue especially for tournament fishing. Mortality rates can get pretty nasty when the water is that warm. Plus...fishing deep is just not as fun as that shoreline top water bite!  Oh well offshore fishing it is! thats where tournaments are won anyways
1030955,grimsbylander,2018-07-10 21:16:00,3016,"I understand tournament fishing lol Mortality rates and even tournaments for that matter are different topics again. And if we're if we're talking largies, as I was, they'll live in a bathtub with an aerator."
1030964,misfish,2018-07-10 23:37:00,29133,"This pass Sunday, I noticed that Simcoe water levels have dropped a foot already. Surface temp was 78.  This was in the bay here."
1030967,chris.brock,2018-07-11 01:31:00,4053,"In warm, shallow water with lots of weeds, on a sunny day, photosynthesis can really pump up the dissolved oxygen to way over saturation. I remember sampling as a student, DO saturation was around 8 mg/l and we were measuring 14 in the hot, shallow water."
1031237,lunkerbasshunter,2018-07-16 18:08:00,2585,On our lake the water is 81 it got as high as 85 July 4th.  What dropped the water temps we think is have wind from a storm.  Stired the colder water underneath up and water temps dropped 10 degrees.  Now back up to 81 as of Saturday night. I find as long as the water temperature stays steady the fish will bite.  When its up and down is when the fishing really starts.
