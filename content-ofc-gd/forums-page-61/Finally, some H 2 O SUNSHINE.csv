I was not enjoying the smoke and haze in Pointe Au Baril all weekend, and then to top it off, people are lighting fireworks. I friggin wish i could have seen where they were coming from, I woulda had the OPP and bylaw enforcement all over them.  Can you believe that though, you can literally see the smoke from the fire and then you think its smart to light fireworks.... man?"
