1023292,OhioFisherman,2018-02-21 19:59:00,6623,"It's interesting how locations and personal experience can dictate lure choices? A surface lure here would be about last on my list for targeting smallies. I caught a lot of bass at Pointe Au Baril on surface lures, but I can't recall any of them being smallies. The 90 mm size looks smallie size, just guessing a 110 mm would be too, but I didn't see that size in a knock off. The 130 looks more largemouth - pike sized to me, but it could work for crazy smallies?"
1023295,AKRISONER,2018-02-21 21:09:00,5558,"shame you are retired from wetting lines ohio...i would take you out and show you how to put 20lbs in the boat in the early season using spooks no problem.  Once the middle of August hits the topwater bite vanishes...but June...look the hell out.  My PB was caught on the weekend following opener using a zara spook jr, stupid me didnt weigh it...you can call it a 2lber if you want. I know it was the biggest ive caught.  [/url]"
1023297,OhioFisherman,2018-02-21 21:45:00,6623,"LOL, it was a forced retirement! I know there are good ones there, and I would still rate PAB as my favorite place to fish!"
1023305,BillM,2018-02-21 23:33:00,17367,"My oldman loves the Zara Spook Jr, probably his fav topwater bait.   Some days it's what the fish want, some days it's not."
1023336,OhioFisherman,2018-02-22 16:50:00,6623,"Part of the fun of fishing to me Bill, figuring out what lure was going to work on any given day. You can look like a hero one day and a zero the next?"
1023338,BillM,2018-02-22 17:00:00,17367,"Absolutely man, patterning out the fish is the best part!    and my oldman wonders why I've got 6 rods at the front of the boat"
1031215,SaugaPikeSlayer,2018-07-16 13:02:00,48,"Had what I consider great success first time using one after work at a Toronto marina. Senkos, paddle tails, and square bills werent catching anything. Hooked up 3 smallies in under an hour once I started tossing the WP. Used a 90 Perch. My only issue with them is if anything gets stuck on the rotor, the body starts to spin and if you don’t have a swivel your line will twist. They only work well where there is no crap floating on the surface. As well, the front hook would occasionally catch my line. I’m going to switch it out to #6. Otherwise highly recommended. Wish I had one earlier. "
1031216,BillM,2018-07-16 13:15:00,17367,"Run heavy mono instead of flouro for a leader, it doesn't sink and won't snag that front hook."
1031217,OhioFisherman,2018-07-16 14:09:00,6623,"A short shank treble the same size may help? Possibly the mechanics of your cast? Mono will sink, I used big chubs and shiners under a slip float, one of the issues was figuring out if I had all the slack line in from them wandering around, and I was usually using 14 - 20 # mono. If you need your line to float? that stuff will work on it too."
1031224,SaugaPikeSlayer,2018-07-16 15:36:00,48,That’s cool. Will have to try it out. Does it affect the invisibilty of fluoro? I have about 18” of 20# fluoro leader on braid.
1031226,OhioFisherman,2018-07-16 15:59:00,6623,"LOL Sauga, the bad thing about fish traveling in schools? they are learning? No idea, my experience with fluoro was limited to berkley vanish and that not often, just usually didn't see a need for it. Really no issues with vanish either, except that it seemed to get nicked up easier than mono around areas with the zebra mussels, and that may have been just me fishing lower and slower during a tough bite."
1031235,David Chong,2018-07-16 18:05:00,836,"They have their place and time! Very popular in the Mid-West, still prefer a walking style bait like a LC Sammy or Yo-Zuri Pencil. On bodies of water where there is a good schooling shad bite, they are every effective."
1031325,Sterling,2018-07-18 11:56:00,477,"There's fluoro and then there's fluoro ""leader material"". I didn't know there was a difference until recently. The fluoro ""leader material"" they sell is incredibly rigid and wants to spring out of your spool, so be careful with how much you put on. Personally I'm a big fan of fluoro. This pike was caught on a whopper plopper earlier this year. It was wavy, cloudy but I was antsy to try it out and got this baby on my 2nd cast. "
1022929,OhioFisherman,2018-02-15 04:08:00,6623,Hot or hype? Thoughts?
1022930,Dan668,2018-02-15 04:39:00,1120,"I used one for a single outing last year after receiving it, caught a bunch of bass. So the early consensus, i like it."
1022932,OhioFisherman,2018-02-15 04:52:00,6623,"I can certainly see where it would have it's uses, and up there with pike and muskie around it doesn't look like a steel or flouro leader would hurt the action."
1022995,Musky Plug,2018-02-15 21:11:00,398,"I like them, have caught a few fish with it. More pike then bass though from my experience although I do use the bigger sized ones. I'm looking to get my hands on a small one and I use a flouro leader,  doesn't impede the action at all."
1023000,kickingfrog,2018-02-15 22:27:00,8333,"It's part of the my arsenal. I have both sizes. I feel that the smaller one is too small for regular smallmouth use and the bigger one is just a little too big, but too small for regular muskie tossing and tough to use with muskie rods. My first open water choice is almost always a super spook, but the plopper is a good choice is two anglers want to through different presentations."

1023004,OhioFisherman,2018-02-15 23:22:00,6623,"Yes Brian, there are a couple of other sizes out there too, a 90mm 3 1/2 inch and a 110mm 4 1/2 inch?

1023008,OhioFisherman,2018-02-15 23:41:00,6623,Every lure is a pike lure up there! LOL
1023009,misfish,2018-02-15 23:51:00,29133,YUP.
1023011,Musky Plug,2018-02-16 00:05:00,398,"Lol, they'll eat just about anything."
1023015,Raf,2018-02-16 00:20:00,3495,"it's a bass size version of a top raider (musky lure) which work great for pike/muskie/big bass you're right, a leader doesn't hurt it one bit."
1023016,OhioFisherman,2018-02-16 00:28:00,6623,"Raf, correct me if I am wrong, but haven't the top raiders been around for a long time?"
1023017,Raf,2018-02-16 00:29:00,3495,"absolutely, they've been around for a very long time."
1023018,OhioFisherman,2018-02-16 00:31:00,6623, I thought I had heard that name in the distant past! 
1023019,Raf,2018-02-16 00:33:00,3495,the pacemaker is another very similar bait that has been around for a long time.  not sure which one's the chicken and which one's the egg.
1023020,OhioFisherman,2018-02-16 00:38:00,6623,"OK, can't say I recall hearing of that one though."
1023023,kickingfrog,2018-02-16 02:33:00,8333,They do fish the same way but the sound is different from a top raider. To my ears (for what that's worth) the top raider has a more metallic sound while the wopper ploppler is more melodic if that makes sense.
1023031,OhioFisherman,2018-02-16 05:03:00,6623,"Yes it makes sense to me kick, kind of like a buzz bait with and without a clacker blade on it? but they both sound more metallic to me also. So what's old is new again?"
1023039,kickingfrog,2018-02-16 15:22:00,8333,"small wopper plopper super spook big wopper plopper single bladed top raider   When I bought my woppers the only 2 sizes were the 2 above. It sounds like they might have move sizes now. The size of the small is ok for me but it is very light and not as easy to cast with my usual topwater baitcast set-ups. The bigger wopper is just a bit too thick in the body for me, for smallmouths. The hooks are much thicker as well and  don't stick bass as well as other hooks."
1023041,AKRISONER,2018-02-16 15:37:00,5558,still prefer the spook over it any day of the week.
1023043,OhioFisherman,2018-02-16 17:00:00,6623,"Kick, I am pretty sure the sizes on them now is 90-110-130-190. I got a couple off of Ali Express to have a look at           https://www.aliexpress.com/item/ALLBLUE-Whopper-Popper-Topwater-Fishing-Lure-13g-9cm-Artificial-Bait-Hard-Fishing-Plopper-Hook-Soft-Rotating/32848403111.html?spm=2114.10010108.1000014.5.607b37dctrg7DS&traffic_analysisId=recommend_3035_null_null_null&scm=1007.13338.80878.000000000000000&pvid=7e846603-26d9-48b2-9642-bb885887bdec&tpp=1 A 130 and a 90, the 130 at like 1 1/3 ounce is heavier than just about any lure I used for bass here. The 90 from that seller isn't quite as deep in the body by the front hook as the original, so it may seem even smaller. The hooks are sticky sharp and finish is very good, on the 90 though the gap between the body and tail section seems a bit sloppy to me. An easy fix might be to strip a piece of insulation off a wire a similar size to the wire shaft, split it a place it between the ball and wire coil on the back."
1023258,BillM,2018-02-21 05:42:00,17367,"That looks like a TopRaider I toss for muskie, because I love the sound it makes..  I still haven't caught a damn muskie on it though"
1023261,OhioFisherman,2018-02-21 06:42:00,6623,I'm pretty sure the bottom one is a top raider Bill. I used to like the sound of a jitterbug coming across the water.
1023275,BillM,2018-02-21 15:33:00,17367,Jitterbug is also awesome.   I might have to try a few of the ones you posted for smallies.  Seems like something you can cover a lot of water with quickly (Opposed to most topwater lures)
