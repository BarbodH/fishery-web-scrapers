Yamaha Portable Outboards At some point over the weekend five brand new Yamaha portable outboards went missing from Pirate Cove Marina. Models and serial numbers are: F2.5SMHB #6EG1010675 F2.5SMHB #6EG1011633 F4SMHA #6EC1012914 F8SMHB #6FWK1009248 F15LMHA #6AGK1053480  Lund 14' Tinnie and Merc 25 Stolen from Village Marina in Honey Harbour was a 14-foot Lund tinnie registration of ON3824730, with a 25 HP Merc, serial number of OR685588. It was on a silver Easy Loader trailer, serial number of 1AEAAKMB7FA014142 with Ontario licence plate L1298Z. Here's a photo:    It's a good bet some or all of these items will wind up on Kijiji before long. Please call the OPP if  you run into any of this stuff, I'm sure the dealers would love to get the stuff back. Cheers "

Unfortunately their will always be a market for hot items. Even from businesses that appear to be reputable. I knew of a camp operator up north that had stolen property 40 years ago, i.e. boats and motors. He did get busted for possession of stolen property, he just claimed ignorance and got off lightly in my opinion."

1030997,Fisherman,2018-07-11 15:25:00,7201,then you'd be polluting the lake with human garbage.

1031025,Carp,2018-07-12 05:30:00,1488,"Tie them up in swamp with no clothes on and let the skeeters, black flies and leeches have a feast."
