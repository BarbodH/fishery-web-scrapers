I was wondering if anyone knows anything about the lake, and whether it will be worth me bringing some gear for us to fish from shore with... Thanks in advance!"

1031201,adam lancia,2018-07-15 20:36:00,234,"That's all I've found too. I was hoping there might be a few on here who might have fished it a few times. Worst case, I bring some soft plastics and hope for the best. Thanks!"
1031344,Mike Pike,2018-07-18 18:57:00,1332,"Hey Adam, good luck exploring.  I wouldn't go by anything you find on Hook and Bullet, though.  I dunno where those reports come from but the species are usually waaaaaaaaay off."
1031354,Woodsman,2018-07-19 03:47:00,1286,"""McCarthy lake in Stratford﻿ ""? Stratford Ontario? I use to live in Stratford (and now live about 1/2 hr away) and never have heard of it. What place are you staying?"
1031386,grimsbylander,2018-07-19 15:56:00,3016,It's more of a pond..maybe 300m in length. It's just east of town off Forest Road. My guess is Forest Motel for the win! lol
1031408,Woodsman,2018-07-20 01:21:00,1286,grimsbylander that was also my guees. Not a serious fishing place. Years back it did get a few trout stocked but no idea how recent. My guess is a few panfish.
1031413,huzzsaba,2018-07-20 01:53:00,884,best people to ask are the owners of the motel.
1031628,adam lancia,2018-07-24 13:33:00,234,"Yup, Forest Motel is right. Just a couple of little bluegill were biting, and I'm not sure if there are any bass in there. It's just about choked with vegetation."
