1031053,floater,2018-07-12 16:42:00,220,Other than the Kipawa forum is there any other english forums for the rest of the Zecs in Quebec? Googled but all in french and I failed french in school.
1031058,Fisherman,2018-07-12 17:12:00,7201,"Failure was not an option with my old man.   I sent them an email to see if they have an anglo website, I'll post if they answer."
1031065,OhioFisherman,2018-07-12 17:32:00,6623,"LOL, no press 1 for English feature? tyranny!"
1031066,jimmer,2018-07-12 17:33:00,2730,What would happen if you failed???? 
1031067,Joeytier,2018-07-12 17:34:00,3990,"There are no forums designated for the zec's in english or french that I'm aware of.  However, every zec website is in both english and french."
1031068,Joeytier,2018-07-12 17:35:00,3990,"And you can just call the office of whatever one you're interested in, they will likely be able to help you."
1031090,Fisherman,2018-07-12 22:05:00,7201,"A beating beyond recovery,  came in handy for me,  spent 6 years in Quebec with the Military,  became bilingual."
1031091,Fisherman,2018-07-12 22:06:00,7201,"Got an email back from them,  no English version at present but they're working on it."
1031112,floater,2018-07-13 12:31:00,220,I was hoping for an english forum that talked about all those lakes way back in over those crappy washboard truck beating roads.
1031117,jimmer,2018-07-13 14:19:00,2730,I wish I could speak French.
1031142,Old Ironmaker,2018-07-14 03:18:00,8243,I got 28% from Madame LeBlanc in grade 12. My wife got 92% in French in Grade 12.  I can carry on a so so conversation in Fort Coulange and she can't say hello in French.
1031145,Fisherman,2018-07-14 13:07:00,7201,"Strange how you can get good marks but can't function.  Reading writing and comprehension, were easy, conversation was a little harder, school parisienne  french is nothing like quebecois."
1031349,Dabluz,2018-07-19 00:16:00,701,"If anyone needs help getting information for any of the ZECs, I can help.  One thing for sure is that if you want good fishing, the ZECs further north are your best bet.  I worked on the ZEC Martin Valin for about 10 years and the fishing is great.  The guys at the gate are helpful.  They are the ones who enter the fishing statistics each night.  Some lakes open late in the season to ensure excellent fishing for brook trout.  There are only brook trout and no other species of fish in this ZEC so excellent fly fishing all summer. "
1031352,Fisherman,2018-07-19 01:56:00,7201,"Wow, wondered what happened to you.  My brother in law runs one up on Mont Valin, Le Malin Pecheur , Pourvoirie du Lac Pierre.  My sons have both gone a number of times and had a great time."
1031359,Sterling,2018-07-19 12:11:00,477,"Not sure about other browsers, but with Chrome you can right click the page and hit ""translate"". Works fine on those french websites such as quebecpeche. Dabluz I used to live in matagami and fished the Nemaska area quite a bit, fell in love with the place. Do you know the area at all?"
1031378,Dabluz,2018-07-19 14:50:00,701,"I got sidetracked for a while.  Strangley enough, after getting a nicer boat I did not go fishing as often.  Was in a new blues band.  I'm having a very hard time with this site.  It is extremeley slow.  I type stuff and sometimes takes a minute for each letter."
1031379,Sterling,2018-07-19 15:09:00,477,I highlighted that problem today here:  You'll have to enable adblock for now.
