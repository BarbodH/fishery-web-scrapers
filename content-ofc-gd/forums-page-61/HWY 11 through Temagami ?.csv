A group of us are going up to Elk Lake in a few days; we usually run strait up 11 to New Liskeard and then head west on 65 to Elk Lake. Has there been any road closures on Hwy 11 or 65, going up to and through Temagami and North of that? I don't want to put our group at risk or be in the way of response or fire fighting crews. Dan.
