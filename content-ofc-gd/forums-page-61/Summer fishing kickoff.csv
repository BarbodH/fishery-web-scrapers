So, I hate spring...... not really, but it’s when my work is busiest. Between getting full time and a raise, I can’t really take any time off for fishing so this is usually my longest drought and the itch was getting bad.  I finally got a day off and decided nothing was going to stop me from fishing. Channeling my inner Brian B I got up at 3am to head out. I had always wanted to fish Canal lake, got there and the bridge/boat launch was closed. Well scratch that. Fished another lake that was close by and had a bit of success. (Pic 1)   Fiahed until noon then headed up to the cottage. Between my mom and I at my favourite spot, the fishing was consistent all weekend. (Pics 2 thru 6) I had the most success with Senkos. Mom was using crayfish coloured cranks.  We headed back on the long weekend, figuring for sure that it was too hot for fishing. The fish were biting pretty consistent in the morning (pics 7-9) my fiancée came out for the night fishing (she refuses to get up early on days off). 5 minutes into getting to the spot, she gets a bite. As she is reeling in, I get a hit. I legit can’t remember the last time i’ve had a double header (pic 10)  I wanted to get one more ‘cute’ pic for my Facebook profile (us millennial do that kinda thing) so I go to kiss my fiancée while we are holding the fish. Needless to say the fish did not approve (pic 11) back Into the water the go. All fish were released to fight another day and the itch was scratched. At least for a little bit.             "

1030896,Acountdeleted,2018-07-09 18:09:00,2562," Haha its only an ewwww when its the fish you are kissing. ? Haha I used to post with photobucket before. It worked great with embedding the pics. This new format is great because I can post from my phone and skip a step. But from what I can tell, no embedding sadly. Thanks bud. I'm glad she enjoys coming with me. Now I just need to figure out how to make sure she doesn't outfish me. Thanks. Was a great outing. Always a good sign that summer is here."
1031026,Cando,2018-07-12 07:28:00,90,You can still get to the public boat launch on Canal Lake. Go into Kirkfield and turn left at the new stop sign. Follow the road under the kirkfield lift locks and there sho be a D1 detour sign to take you you to the boat launch. You can also launch your boat at Sunset Cove Marina and it is a short boat ride into Canal lake.
