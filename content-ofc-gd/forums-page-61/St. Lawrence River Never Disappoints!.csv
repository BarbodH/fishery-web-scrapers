The SLR is an incredible fishery!! I've been going there the last 4 years now and each time it's amazing! Here are the highlights:  Believe it or not... that LM is 3.1lbs! Smallie weighed in at 5.2lbs! Makes the LM look like a dink!  My reaction when I landed the Smallie! hahahahahaha Video of the fight: Click here to watch   Gators-a-plenty on the SLR!   The wifey with a 10.3lb Sheepy! They look so similar to Smallie's under the water... we thought she had a record-SM on at first!  Few pictures of the views:   "
