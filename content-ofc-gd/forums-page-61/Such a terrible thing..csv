1031125,DRIFTER_016,2018-07-13 17:16:00,10439,Lots of drivers put dash cams in their trucks to help protect themselves when car drivers screw up and cut them off or cause accidents. 
1031127,Old Ironmaker,2018-07-13 19:00:00,8243,"When someone apologizes to me for being delayed a few seconds I say the few seconds may be the time I will be late coming to an intersection that some transport blew through the stop, they may have saved my life by delaying me. Or vice versa come to think about it. engineering there is the sinusoidal curve, when more than enough factors meet at the bottom of the curve at the same time is the ""stars aligning"" for a catastrophic event."
1030986,woodenboater,2018-07-11 13:06:00,2277,"you can bet they're going to consider making it an all way stop. and overhead flashing light and/ or rumble strips. also if there's not already one there, a sign warning of a stop ahead."
1030988,lew,2018-07-11 13:33:00,12766,I think I posted way back around the beginning of this thread that I saw a women...I think a meteorologist...being interviewed on TV and she was saying the sun was bright and was at a very low angle at the time of the crash and he would have been driving straight into it. Just my thoughts but I have a feeling that may have been why he didn't see the stop sign & I doubt there's anyone anywhere who hasn't driven into the setting or rising sun and still figured they were OK. I honestly do believe though that this was nothing more than a terrible tragic accident and I don't believe a long harsh jail term will really do any good. I'm certainly not condoning what happened but just giving my opinion but I've certainly been wrong before. ++++ Edit to add I also seem to remember one of the news reports saying there was a flashing red light by the stop sign ++++
1030990,crappieperchhunter,2018-07-11 13:41:00,2582,Never understood the concept of roundabouts...until a few starting popping up around here.  PITA the first few times I used them but easy peasy now. Throw a round about in at that intersection or any other intersection that has similar problems and this will NEVER happen again. 
1030991,grimsbylander,2018-07-11 13:59:00,3016,"I wouldn't say never. If that was the first time he'd driven through that area how would he know there was a round about? If he missed the stop sign with a flashing red light, would he have seen the round about or plow right through? I'm not sure how a round about compensates for someone that didn't see the intersection?"
1030993,crappieperchhunter,2018-07-11 14:34:00,2582,"You can not go straight through at a roundabout..the center is all cement. And if they built the roundabout with the whole center actually being a say 3-4 foot high cement barrier...high enough for everyone to notice...but low enough for everyone to see over, it would be safer still....IMHO. No solution is perfect but I think this one would be  a very good option.  At the end of the day we have all made mistakes while behind the wheel. 30 plus years ago I was turning left at a stop sign onto a 2 lane each way highway. Coming back from a round of golf with some work mates to go pick my wife up at work. 100% sober...never had a drink. In a hurry because I'm running late...I just zoned out when I approached the intersection. Slowed down and then just turned left onto the highway. Screeching tires brought me out of my trance...as a car zoomed by me on my right. Turn just in time to see the driver giving me the death stare as he zoomed by. If it was a one lane each way highway I'm sure we would have both been dead because he would have had no choice but to hit me. I think of this EVERYTIME a story like this bus crash comes up.  We all make mistakes. We don't always get away with it without consequences."
1030994,grimsbylander,2018-07-11 14:46:00,3016,"I agree with this. It was the NEVER statement earlier I didn't quite understand. The UK has a lot of round abouts and they have their share fair of accidents too. The bottom line is, when the human brain is in control, crap is going to happen...regardless of how many precautions are put in place. The problem with rounds abouts is, once you enter them, you have the right away and tend to not concern yourself with vehicles approaching. Plus you're looking/steering around the inside of a circle and away from vehicles approaching on your right. I wouldn't want to get smoked between a vehicle that came in full tilt and that 3 foot cement wall either. Accidents are called accidents for a reason I guess."
1030995,crappieperchhunter,2018-07-11 14:59:00,2582,"I meant never in the sense that the visual aspect of seeing a roundabout from a great distance as this would have been...would have at least made the driver slow down.....so a collision would have been avoided or at the very least at a much slower rate of speed. However you are correct, some of us dumb humans will always find a way to mess things up. So there is really no such thing as never."
1030996,dave524,2018-07-11 15:24:00,4508,"IMHO there is nothing wrong with this intersection, it is the same as thousands of other intersections where a side road crosses a main thoroughfare in rural Canada. Bottom line is some one screwed up and a bunch of kids paid the price.  Let's install rumble strips at every stop sign in the country in that case,  what do they say ?? "" you can't fix stupid "". But they will throw some money and effort at fixing it for appearance sake."

1031007,dave524,2018-07-11 18:50:00,4508,"we had roundabouts over 50 years ago, OI will remember the one at the QEW and 20 HWY. Navigated it a many times early in my driving career. "
1031024,chris.brock,2018-07-12 03:27:00,4053,"There's an uphill stretch of the 401 heading west near Kelso that if the sun is setting on a clear day, traffic pretty much comes to a stop because it's hard to see. That's what drivers have to do if they can't see. I saw the interview of a  parent who was following the bus at the time of the crash and he said the sun wasn't a factor. He was actually there and not some meteorologist surmising stuff in front of a camera.  "
1031029,RickOnt,2018-07-12 11:46:00,669,"Yes  The sun in my eyes  Is a Bull excuse, If you are running down a highway with a fully loaded rig and you can't see   you better slow down, and absolutely for sure slow down if you are unfamiliar with the road."
1031042,BillM,2018-07-12 13:38:00,17367,"To play devils advocate here, how does someone driving a completely different way say the sun wasn't a factor?  If you don't have the sun directly in front of you sure it's not going to bother you at all, lol."
1031043,grimsbylander,2018-07-12 14:17:00,3016,"I thought the exact same thing and let's face it, if I were a parent and saw that, there would be NO acceptable excuse....and I can't say I blame them one bit."
1031044,Terry,2018-07-12 14:43:00,14456,"a terrible thing but i have ran through a stop sign and a red light  no excuses , just some how didnt see it.  so that could be me or many other people i know"
1031045,BillM,2018-07-12 14:46:00,17367,"I'm sure we've all had brain farts when driving, I know I have.   What sucks is the result of this guy not paying attention/being blinded by the sun/whatever."
1031047,Old Ironmaker,2018-07-12 14:56:00,8243,"That's the reason we have a local Golf Tourney every Labour Day weekend and give 100% of the $$ raised to the person we have the fund raiser for whatver they wish.8K last year. 10 years ago I found out that the CEO of Juvenile Diabetes Canada If I recall was making around 2 million a year, yea right non-profit! Non profit my butt. Oh this site is driving me nuts, nothing seems to work, please Blue *16, Mayday, 911. We had 2 ""Traffic Circles near where I gre up in Hamilton, the bottom of Flock Road and Kenilworth S. and at Queenston Rd. and Main St. I caouldn't count how many in southern England and other places across the World. They work there, why not Canada. Can you spell paradigm shift reluctance?"
1031049,Old Ironmaker,2018-07-12 15:31:00,8243,"There are 3 different types of driving, City, highway and country. City is gridlock driving, highway is gridlock driving 120K, then there's country driving, speed limits, flashing reds and yellows and stop signs are ""suggestions"". Our county, Haldimand, has less than 50,000 citizens, not all drive. We don't have a 400 100K max highway  It seems weekly there are fatalities on our roads. A Selkirk stop is to look as far down the road and just blow through. I don't even see the person in front tapping the brakes on, many times, more like all the time unless traffic is coming. It's as dangerous as driving the 401 bumper to bumper doing 125KPH. Many stops here like the corner of Fisherville Rd. and Indian Line, RR3, the intersection has a 30 to 40 degree angle to it. You have to face the oncoming lane at a big angle to get  sight line. If you don't, and many don't you are playing chicken. No one but Grand Pa Hoover does less than 110, and me. I get the finger doing 95. Mostly from truckers that do business at Nanticoke Refinery or Stelco. They think they are on the QEW or 400 series. I bet its the same in rural Sask."
1031092,grimsbylander,2018-07-12 22:09:00,3016,Did you think that individuals that work for non-profits org work for free?? LOL
1031101,SirCranksalot,2018-07-13 01:50:00,3291,In my area there are 3 or for successive 4 way stops  followed by 1 that is not 4 way. The 'experts' are puzzled as to why there are so many accidents at that intersection!!! 
1031103,chris.brock,2018-07-13 02:04:00,4053,"That's a valid statement. I still think he gave a bull crap excuse. From my driving experience, it's a pretty small window, with the right conditions, in the morning and evening when the sun is blinding. And when the sun is blinding,  you can't see anything. So if he was flying along blinded by the sun, he's a careless idiot."
1031111,grimsbylander,2018-07-13 12:30:00,3016,"Those are also valid points. It is however possible that the stars aligned and the conditions existed. And also possible, and more likely, that he is a careless idiot.That's the strange thing about this situation...the excuse that is being offered supports a greater degree of carelessness? It's one thing to simply just not see another vehicle, we're all done it...it's another to say I was perfectly aware of the fact I couldn't see a damn thing, yet proceeded without hesitation. Are we not taught to drive to the conditions? Snow, traffic, fog, SUN...this determines speed, not the little signs along the road. Still tragic and will remain a mystery."
1031113,woodenboater,2018-07-13 13:04:00,2277,be very curious to know if the trucking company had a dash cam on that rig.
1031118,BillM,2018-07-13 14:32:00,17367,"That video should never be released if that's the case, and from what I've read, the trucking company consisted of two trucks, not a big company at all (Which has also gone out of business) Pretty sure it was the drivers cousin that owned it?"
1031119,OhioFisherman,2018-07-13 14:38:00,6623,"Just my experience with trucking companies, and I worked for a number of them over a 30+ year driving career, they didn't normally have anything on them that the law or a union contract didn't require. I seem to recall seeing that that company had a total of two trucks? They were probably lucky to keep tires on them?"
1028562,LostAnotherOne,2018-05-18 16:48:00,956,Thats true.  Just seems a little high of a charge and i might be still a little rattled with the whole tragedy.
1028566,BillM,2018-05-18 19:10:00,17367,"The people that are working with this money to make sure it's properly divided are most likely not working for free either.   I don't see GoFundMe as making $$ off this tragedy, it's their business model."
1028567,LostAnotherOne,2018-05-18 19:30:00,956,"All im saying guys is that every penny donated should be going to the families and not into anyones pocket.  GoFundMe has a great business model and Humboldt wouldnt have gotten that much money without it, but it should be run as a non profit organization."
1028568,SirCranksalot,2018-05-18 19:56:00,3291,It sounds like they are doing what they can to make it fair. No doubt that not everyone will be satisfied despite anybody's best effort.   http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/humboldt-broncos-memorial-fund-announcement-1.4667572
1028569,OhioFisherman,2018-05-18 20:21:00,6623,"Exactly, their percentage is clear."
1028572,John Bacon,2018-05-18 21:05:00,3277,Why should GoFundMe be run as a not for profit?
1028574,OhioFisherman,2018-05-18 21:22:00,6623,Compared to some other alleged non profit charities the  percent actually going to the people in need is pretty stellar?
1028577,SirCranksalot,2018-05-18 21:55:00,3291,Yup Here in Canada major charities such as cancer have a big administrative overburden so that the recipients get a whole lot less than 90%
1028740,DRIFTER_016,2018-05-23 22:25:00,10439,"Update on the GoFundMe site today regarding the dispersion of funds etc.  To our donors,  We'd like to take this opportunity to clarify how the Humboldt Broncos Memorial Fund Inc. (HBMFI) and the HumboldtStrong Community Foundation operate as two separate entities.   HBMFI:  The money donated to this GoFundMe page will be distributed by the HBMFI only to the 29 families of those who were injured or who lost their lives.   In 2015, the Government of Saskatchewan enacted law regarding crowdfunding donations known as The Informal Public Appeals Act. The HBMFI was created solely to oversee the fair allocation of the GoFundMe funds for their intended purpose, according to the process dictated by Saskatchewan law. While the HBMFI will work as quickly as possible, this legal process merits careful attention and should not be rushed.  The GoFundMe raised a total of $15,174,900. After the deduction of fees necessary to cover the cost of third-party card processors, and the safe and secure transfer of funds (2.9% plus 30 cents per donation), the net amount which HBMFI anticipates receiving is $14,676,373,94. 100% of this amount will go to those who were injured, and to the families of those who lost their lives. All of the caring officers, directors, legal counsel and advisory committee members will serve the HBMFI without compensation, and all additional services necessary for the operation of the HBMFI will be contributed free of charge.   The HBMFI have ensured the families are aware of this process and its ongoing commitment to ensuring their financial needs are served, whether that’s through the continued facilitation of insurance payments, or your donated funds.  HumboldtStrong Community Foundation:   In the wake of this tragedy, the Humboldt Broncos have also received generous donations through other outlets outside of this GoFundMe. These funds will be managed by a separate non-profit organization called the HumboldtStrong Community Foundation. The funds within this Foundation are not connected to the GoFundMe in any way. Instead, they will support a broader range of individuals and organizations affected by the crash of the Humboldt Broncos team bus on April 6, 2018, and the aftermath thereof, including but not limited to: Humboldt Broncos’ players, employees, families, and volunteers; first responders and emergency services personnel and other teams, athletes, related organizations and communities.  The Humboldt Broncos’ family is #HumboldtStrong and united and will remain so as we move forward together in support of those affected by April 6."
1028913,DRIFTER_016,2018-05-28 20:54:00,10439,Awesome news!!!! https://www.tsn.ca/player-paralyzed-in-humboldt-bus-crash-going-to-u-s-for-treatment-1.1096915
1030792,AKRISONER,2018-07-06 17:52:00,5558,Chris...you got your wish hopefully justice gets served. It really seems to my like the RCMP took their time with this to ensure that their case was very very solid. https://www.cp24.com/arrest-made-in-connection-to-deadly-humboldt-broncos-bus-crash-1.4002904
1030795,Old Ironmaker,2018-07-06 20:03:00,8243,During the RCMP Press Conf. this afternoon announcing the over 30 charges the spokesman said they had 125 officers and staff investigating from day 1. They made sure every i was dotted and every t was crossed. Before we get a lynch mob together and hang the accused ask yourself if you have never blown a STOP sign or gone through a red? I have and have been very lucky. When I was 17 with a new licence I passed a stopped School Bus on a very busy Hamilton street. I cried like a teen right there and then and thanked God I didn't kill a child. I can tell you I never did that again.
1030796,BillM,2018-07-06 20:32:00,17367,An accident is an accident.  I can't imagine what that truck driver is going through.  However justice needs to be served and we'll see what happens.
1030797,grimsbylander,2018-07-06 21:08:00,3016,"What this teaches us is just how important it is to be conscientious while driving. We all break laws every day when we drive above the posted limit, roll through a stop, or what seems to be very popular now, cruising through traffic lights really late. It doesn't seem a big deal because we generally don't get caught and it doesn't end with the horrific results mentioned above. But it could and that's what we all need to remember. I'm as guilty as the next guy and thank heavens I've never been on either side of that type of crash. Charges? Sure, but nobody wins here."
1030802,SirCranksalot,2018-07-07 00:35:00,3291,"No doubt justice must be served but I can't see it bringing any comfort to the families of those who were killed, or anyone else for that matter."
1030944,DRIFTER_016,2018-07-10 16:35:00,10439,"I don't know what to think about the ridiculously low bail amount  the fellow is out on. Just $1,000. I would think it would be a bit higher considering all the lives ruined. I sure hope this doesn't turn out like that case of the child molester at the West Edmonton Mall wave pool. ?"
1030946,AKRISONER,2018-07-10 17:06:00,5558,"remember bail is set on a basis of risk of not appearing and potentially re-committing the crime. Remember, you dont pay bail at all if you simply show up on your court date. The point is that there is no reason to force this guy to borrow money to pay his own bail. He isnt going to be driving, and theres obviously little to no risk of him not appearing. The guy isnt a ""career criminal"" hes a person that made an absolutely horrific mistake and used poor judgment. Big difference between the two."
1030948,grimsbylander,2018-07-10 17:41:00,3016,If i was driving that truck I'd  be a bigger risk to myself than anyone else. I can't imagine the emotions on all sides.
1030949,BillM,2018-07-10 18:34:00,17367,"He's not a danger to the public, what should his bail be set at?"
1030971,chris.brock,2018-07-11 03:09:00,4053,"I think the RCMP took their time so emotions and the lynch mob would calm down. My whole issue with this was Canada seems to have become overly politically correct, too racially sensitive and over accommodating. $1k bail? Hopefully they took his passport and he has a gps tracker ankle bracelet thing."
1030975,Old Ironmaker,2018-07-11 09:26:00,8243,"Obviously the Judge didn't think he  was neither a flight risk or likely to repeat the offence. I don't know if his licence has been suspended, has it?"
1030979,HTHM,2018-07-11 12:12:00,4082,Let's not forget: Innocent until PROVEN guilty

1030982,mikeh,2018-07-11 12:44:00,824,I wonder if they are going to make changes to the intersection?
1030985,AKRISONER,2018-07-11 13:00:00,5558,"most definitely they will at minimum put rumble strips, a flashing stop light...something. Any time you see a big time fatality like this usually the problem gets addressed with larger warnings etc."
1028321,SirCranksalot,2018-05-13 22:16:00,3291,"I'm with Bill on this one. Anyone with a conscience will be tormented by this for the rest of their life, regardless of who was at fault. I have heard stories---friends of friends kind of stories but some, if not all must be true----of drivers  who tortured themselves when they were not at fault. One of those was the man who killed a kid just up the road from my sons' school. The driver had no chance---- the kid jumped out in front of him----but the driver's life was forever changed, and not for the better."
1028322,chris.brock,2018-05-13 22:34:00,4053,"Harold, this driver was definitely at fault in this case. ok, I'm going to say it, a non white guy accidentally killed a bunch of young, white hockey players. Because of our politically correctness and wanting to accommodate and not offend anyone, the rules seem to be different for this incident. "
1028323,SirCranksalot,2018-05-13 22:39:00,3291,"Ok, I won't argue that he was not at fault. And if he was criminally negligent in some way he will need to be held accountable for that. My point was that any punishment imposed by the state will be minor compared to the punishment his conscience will give him -----assuming he's not a psychopath."
1028324,woodenboater,2018-05-14 00:27:00,2277,"but a driver following the bus isn't seeing the same view as the trucker so that's moot to me. ymmv. and everything will come out, guaranteed. this is too high profile for it to disappear into the paperwork. and charges will be coming if facts determine there was no reason he couldn't stop. I'll wait for the reconstruction team to figure out why it happened. I hope they're handling this case with extreme caution."
1028326,HTHM,2018-05-14 01:32:00,4082,"Which is precisely why it is taking so long for the investigation to conclude. The RCMP have their finest on this case,  I am certain of it."
1028327,chris.brock,2018-05-14 02:02:00,4053,"dude, he was there, we weren't, he said the sun was a non factor. Regardless, if the sun was a factor, why is he driving fast and blowing through stop signs if he can't see? I think the investigation is pretty straight forward and has been over for quite a while Albert.    "
1028328,SirCranksalot,2018-05-14 02:04:00,3291,I'm sure you will hear more if criminal charges are laid. 
1028329,chris.brock,2018-05-14 02:17:00,4053,IF criminal charges are laid? He man slaughtered 15 kids
1028330,Old Ironmaker,2018-05-14 02:25:00,8243,Do you have information no one else has? Is this a case of guilty until proven innocent?
1028332,chris.brock,2018-05-14 02:39:00,4053,"umm, if you miss a stop sign?? probably guilty, that's reasonable I would say  "
1028338,RickOnt,2018-05-14 11:47:00,669,"You can make up all the excuses you want, But bottom line the truck driver went through a stop sign in front of a bus and 15 people were killed"
1028349,AKRISONER,2018-05-14 14:40:00,5558,"as far as i was aware, if you commit a traffic violation which causes an accident, you get charged with careless driving at a minimum. There is 0 doubt the guy blew a stop sign, because if he didnt, he wouldnt have hit the bus going that fast. Hence, i think we can all agree that charges will definitely be laid, its just a matter of to what degree. It doesnt matter if theres, black ice, you are driving at night during a blizzard, you are required to drive according to conditions. So even if the sun was right in his eyes causing him to blow a stop sign, he is still guilty of careless driving causing death...if he couldnt see, he was supposed to slow down to a safe speed, thats how the law is written, theres no way around it. I got into an accident 10 years ago where i hit black ice and ended up crashing (i was admittedly inexperienced with driving during a flash freeze) the only reason i didnt get charged is because the person following me was able to confirm that we were driving exactly the speed limit and I didnt hit anyone, i just crashed into the ditch. Had I been speeding or committed any other driving infractions, i was going to be charged. Thats how driving laws work, its like rear ending someone, if you rear end someone you are always at fault because you were not leaving enough space or driving according to conditions."
1028352,zenon11,2018-05-14 16:47:00,75,Seems to me that it’s a stretch to assume because it may not have been a white truck driver (I have no idea) that it’s different. I thought any accident has to be investigated fully before any info is released. Just seems normal to me. No need to get all worked up about claiming political correctness when it’s just plain due diligence.
1028379,Whitespinnerbait,2018-05-14 23:10:00,2038,Exactly !!!.........enough said right there.
1028380,BillM,2018-05-14 23:44:00,17367,"No one is denying he blew the stop sign.    Was he under the influence?  Tired?  Blinded by the sun? The reason makes a huge difference.   Like I said before, accidents happen and this guy is going to have to live with it forever."
1028382,SirCranksalot,2018-05-15 00:40:00,3291,What's the point of all this speculation?? Why assume anything about the identity of the driver or his negligence. Trials in our justice system may leave a lot to be desired but they are still a whole lot better than trials by social media!  
1028384,chris.brock,2018-05-15 02:03:00,4053,my original point was the negligent truck driver is being sheltered and I don't agree with that. 
1028385,mikeh,2018-05-15 02:17:00,824,"hopefully they make changes to the intersection, either a four way stop or a stop light. I don't know for sure but it seems like the trees right at the intersection stopped them from seeing each other (expropriate the land and cut down the trees)."
1028387,SirCranksalot,2018-05-15 12:23:00,3291,Would they normally release the name before charges are laid? 
1028392,woodenboater,2018-05-15 13:30:00,2277," drop the trees (which shouldn't make a diff if one has to stop anyways, unless right of way driver is absolutely smoking) but rumble strips would be better as it's audible and you feel it so it gets your attention. or possible an overhead flashing red. I'd put money down that there will be a coroner's inquest into this accident after the court case wraps up."
1028393,RickOnt,2018-05-15 14:04:00,669,"In the Marco Muzzo incident, 3 years ago,  a Grandfather and 3 grandchildren were killed. His name was released pending charges."
1028395,DRIFTER_016,2018-05-15 14:47:00,10439,Rumble strips leading up to the stop signs would do the trick. The trees don't matter if the East/West traffic actually stops at the stop sign. You can see fine if you stop as there is about 30' of clean ditch before the trees.

1026941,lew,2018-04-19 18:24:00,12766,This was in a local paper this morning and to me it really says alot.  
1028251,chris.brock,2018-05-12 04:14:00,4053,"I know it won't bring back the lives lost, but why did this tragic story fade away with the truck driver, the culprit, sheltered and kept out of it?"
1028253,LostAnotherOne,2018-05-12 11:51:00,956,I want to know if hes going to be driving again.  Not sure if they can pull his license thou.  If he was drinking yes.  No remorseful person would ever get in a truck again.
1028255,woodenboater,2018-05-12 12:32:00,2277,news cycle keeps moving. also the Toronto van murders was huge news. something else will dominate the news soon
1028261,Old Ironmaker,2018-05-12 13:27:00,8243,"I have always wondered if seat belts on buses may save lives? I have seen video of children flying through the air smashing themselves against the ceiling and the metal components inside a school bus during a collision. There was a debate as to whether seat belts on  School Buses was going to be mandatory in some jurisdictions including the US but transportation companies were concerned with the added costs. Nothing came of it. Seat belts have to be better than nothing I would think. Safety of buses has never evolved like autos, why?."
1028288,chris.brock,2018-05-12 23:38:00,4053,I think the police and the media are keeping the truck driver in the shadows purposely. I think a lot of Canadians were pretty emotionally involved in this tragic story and would have wanted blood if they knew why the truck driver did this and who he is. 
1028289,LostAnotherOne,2018-05-12 23:47:00,956,No doubt Chris.  I have a feeling why and its probably the best move. There could possibly be retaliation against a certain community.
1028290,DRIFTER_016,2018-05-13 00:13:00,10439,There have been lots of instances of people buying their class 1 licenses out West as well. Not saying that this is what happened here though. It was also the guys 2nd day on the job. It's going to take a ton of time before the investigation is complete as well.
1028291,SirCranksalot,2018-05-13 01:19:00,3291,has it been established that the truck driver was at fault? 
1028292,LostAnotherOne,2018-05-13 01:31:00,956,Good point.  Everything now is just speculation.
1028294,John Bacon,2018-05-13 01:32:00,3277,"The truck driver had a stop sign and the bus driver didn't.  They are still investigating, but unless the brakes failed on the truck, it seems unlikely that they could come to to any conclusion other than the truck driver being at fault."
1028295,chris.brock,2018-05-13 01:58:00,4053,"I also have a feeling why, but I'm not sure it's the best move to cover stuff up because I think everyone must be responsible for their actions and this country might be a little over accommodating. Telling the whole story might save lives too. Say it was distracted driving for example, people might think twice about doing it now."
1028296,SirCranksalot,2018-05-13 02:00:00,3291,Thx---I didn't know that. 
1028306,Old Ironmaker,2018-05-13 04:38:00,8243,It is all speculation as to the root cause of this tragedy until all the investigations are done and I would think there will be a Coroners Inquest . I know the trucking companies here in southern Ont. can not get experienced drivers behind the wheels of both small and big rigs. The pay is almost minimum wage if that. Not sure about out west. The owner had only 1 driver at the time of the accident and his fleet was 2 trucks only it has been reported. I don't know if this means anything and I might get blasted for being politically incorrect but the majority of drivers of these old hoopdy dump trucks and smaller rigs I see on the roads out here can hardly speak English and haven't been here in Canada for long.  There may be unique challenges these guys face. I will bet dollars to donuts these guys are on the roads longer than they are supposed to be without down time and proper training and I bet many aren't even qualified.
1028309,BillM,2018-05-13 14:14:00,17367,"I really don't wanna speculate to be honest.   Even if it was his 2nd day on the job, what happens if he gets blinded by the sunset and didn't know the roads?  That's an honest to god accident they'll he'll need to live with for the rest of his life.  Still wanna lynch him for that?"
1028320,chris.brock,2018-05-13 22:07:00,4053,"A parent following the bus said the sun wasn't a factor. The point is, I don't think the story is ever going to come out. We don't know the details, but the driver was negligent for sure. As for lynching him, maybe, I don't think saying ""oops, sorry about that"" is good enough. We have laws and penalties so stuff like this doesn't happen."
1026043,jimmer,2018-04-09 16:55:00,2730,Agreed.
1026046,BillM,2018-04-09 17:54:00,17367,4.8mil+ in the GoFundMe account.  Unbelievable!!
1026047,misfish,2018-04-09 17:55:00,29133,True. Many a times.  I digress on my statement. He will be living with this for the rest of his life.
1026048,DanD,2018-04-09 18:02:00,2223,I agree that this is tragic for all involved; not matter who's at fault. Just hope all that survived can get through this without lasting misery. Dan.
1026050,muskymatt,2018-04-09 18:29:00,2608,I was in tears the whole show last night. You could feel the pain and anguish of the people. Heartbreaking! 
1026051,AKRISONER,2018-04-09 18:48:00,5558,"not much to be said...my cousin is a billet family for players on the Flin Flon Bombers in the SJHL, the relationship that he builds with the kids is incredible...this tragedy is just devastating far too many people. So very very sad."
1026053,Whitespinnerbait,2018-04-09 19:45:00,2038,Good point...never thought of that
1026055,DRIFTER_016,2018-04-09 20:00:00,10439,My friend here at work knows most of the victims. Her family owns a farm about 10 minutes away from this intersection. Her parents used to billet players as well until they got to be in their late 70's early 80's. Her sister and brother in law still run the farm today.  Wait for the accident reconstruction crew to figure out what happened. There obviously needs to be some safety upgrades at this intersection as there have now been 21 deaths in just two accidents. It has stop signs and flashing lights but could either use rumble strips on approach to the signs or traffic lights. I think rumble strips would be fine as they warn of the stop ahead.
1026056,DRIFTER_016,2018-04-09 20:09:00,10439,Up to almost $6 million now.  
1026057,lew,2018-04-09 20:24:00,12766,CBC National did an hour program early this morning and they interviewed a meteorologist who said at the time of the accident the sun was only about 21 degrees above the horizon. Obviously she didn't say that caused the accident but I spose if it was in his eyes as he was travelling west it may have hindered his vision making it tough to see the stop sign. I'd guess most of us have experienced poor visibility heading into a low sun.
1026059,206,2018-04-09 20:56:00,563,wife was just saying they miss identified one of the deceased. Can't imagine being in anyone involved shoes ....what a tragedy
1026062,buick14,2018-04-09 21:02:00,741,Very very true.
1026063,muskymatt,2018-04-09 21:11:00,2608,Doesn't matter who or how or why. All that matters is the broken lives in a town with 15 less than the 5800 it had. Should be a god given right to not have to live through the passing of a child. So absolutely tragic. 
1026065,lew,2018-04-09 21:23:00,12766,I've been through it Matt and it's the absolute worst thing a parent can experience and I can't even imagine how many family members and friends are going through it right now.

1026092,DanD,2018-04-10 10:46:00,2223,"I Agree but like the saying and hopefully it is so with this; time heels all. I also know what it's like to loose loved ones; in 2012, with in a 10 month time frame, we buried 6 family members. Ages ranging from 38 to 84; my dad being the eldest. Two brothers and a sister; it was a year from hell. I think of all of them everyday; i'm still sad that they are gone; but the pain in my heart has lessened. Dan"

There doesn't seem to be any skid marks noticeable from the tractor trailer rig trying to stop. Just speculation on my part. We will have to wait until the RCMP have finished their investigation to know what really happened.

I hope we don't try the guy through the court of popular opinion until all the facts come out and if need be he gets his day in court. It has already started though.

If, hypothetically, the trucker ran the sign, wouldn't the front end and cab have been totalled as well  It looks like he caught the front right quarter of the bus, judging by the way the bus is peeled. Can't imagine being a first responder to this and they're going to need help as well.  this Roy MacGregor column says it all... https://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/article-the-humboldt-tragedy-fifteen-dreams-shattered-when-that-truck-and-bus/"
