476919,ctdd2006,2010-06-18 02:19:00,531, Agreed!  Been there...done that and happy!
476920,krawler,2010-06-18 02:23:00,167,"Outlet Bait and tackle, good deals but shipping is high, imo."
476932,pigless,2010-06-18 03:49:00,22,"Can try the bargain bin section on cabelas.com or the clearance section on basspro.com, sometimes they have some pretty good stuff on sale. But you'll need to account for customs & duty coming over the boarder. Sometimes it's still worth it though."
477024,mepps,2010-06-18 15:18:00,1301,"I made an order from OverStock bait with a friend - they dont usually ship to Cananda unless its over $100 The selection isn't huge, but there are some solid pike/musky lure for a good price.  http://www.overstockbait.com/"

1031054,DevinCoons,2018-07-12 16:54:00,3,"did not notice how old the post was guys + I had 10 beers after landing a 20lb Pike at the lake Lake Charlevoix last night, what a battle it was. And yeah your number one place would be www.overstockbait.com ? even 8 years ago it was mentioned already"
1031077,Snidley,2018-07-12 19:31:00,620,"If you live in southern Ontario there's always Angling Outfitters in Woodstock. Depending on what you want he has an incredible diversity of lures for everything that swims (especially Musky stuff)  and he also has over $200k worth of closeout stuff he bought in the US at cents on the dollar. Lots of his stuff is expensive but the closout stuff in incredibly cheap ( if it's what you need) and it's a destination well worth visiting if you are down that way. The owner, Jocylyne, is incredibly knowledgable about electonics if you need help there as well."
