Lake was glass,no bugs and I was the only one out there at 4:30 am. LOL I started the early morning jigging a wiliams spoon to see if what ever was in that pack of bait 20-40 fow down. Nada.  Maybe I will try lowering my fugi cam next outing to see what the hell these fish are. I get, many watch my videos and well on this day, I had some visitors and that is cool, AND, everyone kept their distance from each other. Even had 2 passers byes say they enjoy my vids and would not even think of setting up close. Just glad to see the fish are around. Watched one guy catch a laker using live minnows. Cool. The first fish of the morning was a HUGE fish. I came in around the 70 fow mark.It was a huge thick red line. I reeled up from the bottom quick. When our paths crossed, I just kept reeling. It turned on a dime and chased me. When I reached the 40 fow mark, he smashed it. That is when all hell broke loose. It just dove to the bottom. I was at this fish mercy. The fight back was very different then I have been use to. The amount of head shakes was nuts. After a bit of a battle, I got stupid and tried to put the brakes on him. He gone. As the area seemed to have a few anglers, I moved a few hundred feet away. Traveling on the toon on glass water is so nice. I mark 2 fish, drop the bait. Bait gets to 50 fow and the 2 marks come screaming up.  I just stopped the bait. No chase ensued. One of the two, just latched on. Man these lakers were full of piss and vinegar this morning. My poor reel has taken a filtered try again please kick,n these past few weekends. "
