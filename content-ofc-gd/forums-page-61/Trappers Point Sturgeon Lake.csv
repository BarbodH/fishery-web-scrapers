I was wondering if anyone has stayed at trappers point in the past. We are still trying to gather any information we can on sturgeon lake. Especially the north/west end where trappers is. We also will have use of boats on some of the out lakes in the area. Can anyone shed some light on the area around trappers and the area lakes around sturgeon and savant?Â  Any info would be enormously helpful. Thanks in advance.  Scott stay safe and good fishin!!"
