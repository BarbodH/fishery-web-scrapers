1031214,gil,2018-07-16 11:29:00,41,Got to replace some leaking rivets on my mmirrocraft 16. Where would i get rivets. I only need maybe 50. 3/16x 3/8in. Any  leads much appreciated. Im in Niagara area. Thanks.
1031220,Hack_Fisherman,2018-07-16 14:38:00,720,"Spaenaur carries them. Part number PR – 102 has a grip range of .251” To .375” Part number 310–380 has a grip range of .376” to .500” 5056 aluminum body, closed end, dome head.  saying that, this has a coated steel mandrel. Not ideal for a boat sitting in water. (mine is dry stored so it wouldn’t bother me so much) if you know supply of all aluminum closed end rivets, could you please post it here? I need some also"
1031251,DRIFTER_016,2018-07-16 22:15:00,10439,I use Hanson closed end blind rivets Stainless mandrel/ Stainless head. Much stronger than aluminium and no rust. I dip them in marine sealant before installing so I get a perfect seal. They also have the aluminium mandrel/aluminium head rivets you were asking about Hack. As well as stainless mandrel/aluminium head. https://www.hansonrivet.com/rivets/blind-pop-advel-rivets/closed-end-blind-rivets/ 
1031313,cisco,2018-07-18 02:15:00,597,Before replacing I would just rebuck the existing ones. Might be all you need.
