1031373,grimsbylander,2018-07-19 14:22:00,3016,Awesome! I got a ride in one as a kid. I still remember driving down the boat ramp and out onto the lake! lol

1031388,OhioFisherman,2018-07-19 16:08:00,6623,"LOL, pretty good sized front and rear casting platforms though? Stopped for ice cream on the way home from the boat long ago and there was 3-4 of them in the parking lot, must have been some kind of club meeting."

1031410,John Bacon,2018-07-20 01:37:00,3277,"Did they have steel ""hulls""?  They may go down pretty quick if they've been exposed to a little too much salt. "
