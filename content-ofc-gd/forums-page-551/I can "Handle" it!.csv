572703,Roy,2011-04-15 21:34:00,13728," Cliff, even if he's donating that rod, technically it's still his."
572718,Marko,2011-04-15 21:55:00,854,Float rod and pier casting rod are yours for sure. Rest is anybody`s guess really
572722,GBW,2011-04-15 21:59:00,8460,bass and one of the two flatline rods are for others.
572725,Big Cliff,2011-04-15 22:01:00,6899," Shut up Roy, I need some new OFC decals!"
572731,misfish,2011-04-15 22:09:00,29133," Roy,show repect to yer elders."
572733,GoneFishin,2011-04-15 22:13:00,349,"Those are some nice rods your building there! Wish I had the cash for a custom rod.  If I had to guess I would say the musky rod, light action rigging and, I'm thinking maybe you caught the itch and are making your self some nice flat lining rods. The rest I could easily see you having clients for this time of year."
572734,Roy,2011-04-15 22:13:00,13728,"AHHHHHHH Cliff, I'll send you a coupla decals if that's all it is. But, they'll be addressed to Sue!"
572738,John,2011-04-15 22:26:00,2956,I'm gonna say the flatlining rods the rigging rod and the muskie rod are yours.... (I know who the float rod is for).....
572889,Spiel,2011-04-16 12:47:00,9065,"    GoneFishin has it right as did you John but you weren't first, I will treat you to a beer though next time we get together.  GF, PM me your address and I'll get them decals out to you. Oh and it ain't a new ""itch,"" just adding some new options to the arsenal."
572893,Spiel,2011-04-16 12:54:00,9065,  Handles are generally personal preference Brian. Some guys like rings so they can put (move) the reel where they like and some guys want fixed cause they know exactly where they want the reel. Personally I stay away from rings on all my rods with the exception of ice rods.
572894,John,2011-04-16 12:55:00,2956,That's OK.............. if you need some company at any time testing out the new trolling arsenal just let me know
572926,solopaddler,2011-04-16 14:51:00,8605,My handle looks fabulous bud.  If anyone can guess which one is mine you win....a free Tim Hortons coffee (pick up in Hamilton only).
572932,kickingfrog,2011-04-16 15:01:00,8333, Your handle is second from the top... and don't ask how I know what solo's handle looks like.
572942,solopaddler,2011-04-16 15:37:00,8605, Winner!  I owe you a coffee.
572962,Fish Farmer,2011-04-16 16:45:00,2234,You still trying to design a special rod for me.   Your making me feel left out  . It's going to cost you a new decal or
572967,Big Cliff,2011-04-16 17:02:00,6899," OK, so that is Sue Bignell 313 Snug Harbour Rd. Lindsay, ON K9V 4R6  Oh, and I'll be there when she opens the package so just watch what else you put in there LOL."
572970,Spiel,2011-04-16 17:07:00,9065," Can't say I blame you Cliff, good chance Roy will be in the package."
572975,GoneFishin,2011-04-16 17:28:00,349," Haha, awsome, I can always use some decals   I had a feeling you were going to say that lol. I don't recall seeing reports from you flat lining trout so I assumed maybe you just started. It's my first year trying for trout out in lake O, and by the looks of it, (if I get a bigger boat) bass might be taking a back seat this year. Hopefully I can manage to get some riggers by summer  What are the specs of the lining rods your building yourself? Personally I would love an 8 maybe 9 foot rod with parabolic action out there that I could bend in half on a rainbow haha, bring the best part of float fishing to the lake!"
572988,aplumma,2011-04-16 18:04:00,6896,  He already designed the perfect rod for you but Mattel already has the patent on Barbie and Barbie like products...   Art
572989,kickingfrog,2011-04-16 18:05:00,8333, And the prices just went up. I'm winning just like that charlie guy.
573010,Spiel,2011-04-16 20:15:00,9065," The two balnks I'm building for flat lining are both Lamiglas (glass) 8.5' steelhead blanks rated for 8-12lb test, medium fast action. The light rigging rod also a Lamiglas (glass) is also 8.5', but it's a flyrod blank, 8 weight, totally parabolic but truly too soft for flat lining."
572606,Spiel,2011-04-15 17:44:00,9065,   From the top....  A Great Lakes flat lining rod (x2) A float rod A musky rod A bass rod A pier casting rod and .... A light action rigging rod.  The best part is 4 of them are mine.  The sad part is I'll be busy building them for the next week or two.
572612,Lunkerhunter,2011-04-15 17:54:00,455,they look great spiel. are we supposed to guess which ones are yours? lol
572614,Spiel,2011-04-15 17:58:00,9065,  Thank you.  And sure why not.....LOL  Lets see who can get it right.
572617,GBW,2011-04-15 18:01:00,8460,where is the one with my name on it?  they do look good too.  the Musky and Pier rod's are foe others...
572620,Spiel,2011-04-15 18:06:00,9065,"I'll tell you what, the first person to guess which 4 rods are mine will get an a couple of OFC decals from me.  Oh and GBW, you're incorrect."
572624,GBW,2011-04-15 18:09:00,8460,hummm...  the float rod and musky rod are for someone else then.
572626,Guest gbfisher,2011-04-15 18:12:00,0,first second third and fifth are yers?
572627,irishfield,2011-04-15 18:15:00,26272,Da Musky Rod and Bass Rod have no place in a Spiel arsenal !
572628,Nipfisher,2011-04-15 18:15:00,2449,My guess is the bottom 2 are not yours.
572631,GBW,2011-04-15 18:17:00,8460,that was my next guess
572636,Guest gbfisher,2011-04-15 18:25:00,0,I can understand that about the Bass Rod but with the other?...maybe there was progression...
572645,mercman,2011-04-15 18:42:00,7054,"I'm too new to tell by a handle, but if what i heard about you is correct, the first 3 are yours.And the Muskie rod is mine and the Pier casting rod is yours also.  "
572652,Spiel,2011-04-15 18:55:00,9065, Are you certain?
572653,irishfield,2011-04-15 18:55:00,26272,Fairly !
572654,Spiel,2011-04-15 18:57:00,9065, Then you'd be wrong.
572657,irishfield,2011-04-15 18:58:00,26272,Okay.. so the bass rod and the pier rod aren't your then..
572658,Terry,2011-04-15 18:59:00,14456,I thought muskie and bass too
572659,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-04-15 19:03:00,0,"the float rod reel seat is pretty fancy schmancy mr. spiel. i just finished my first casting rod for a friend of mine.  guide placement seems tougher than spinning rods... at the moment i'm working on a 6' speck rod for myself and a 6'6"" med-heavy for another friend.  still takes me quite a while for each guide but i'm finding myself to be pretty picky with how it looks... apparently much pickier than my chums!"
572660,Spiel,2011-04-15 19:05:00,9065,"Hint....  The bass rod is being donated to are good friend Ryan, c/o - http://www.ofncommun...showtopic=51642"
572661,Spiel,2011-04-15 19:06:00,9065,"  My worst critic is me Dr, get used to it, it'll make you proud in the end!"
572662,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-04-15 19:09:00,0,that makes me feel a LITTLE better about the 2 hours I spent on one guide the other night.  by the end my eyes were crossing trying to burnish my sloppy tag ends... the next day i made a flawless wrap my first try.
572665,Spiel,2011-04-15 19:13:00,9065,"  LOL....when I get to that point Luc I get up and walk away, tomorrow is always a better option when frustration gets a hold of me."
572679,Roy,2011-04-15 20:14:00,13728,Best hint I can give anyone is to not rely on what Spiel fishes for.
572682,Big Cliff,2011-04-15 20:21:00,6899,"OK, I know you already have a float rod, and since you are donating the bass rod, I'm going with 1, 3, 5, and 6 for you.  Do I win? Do I win?"
572694,misfish,2011-04-15 21:04:00,29133,"Chris a question on the float rod handle if I may. I have noticed guys with fixed seats.When it,s made,do you have the reel to make sure the rod is balanced/the seat is in the right place? I like the ring handles,as I can use different reels and balance the rod by moving them.  BTW they look very nice."
