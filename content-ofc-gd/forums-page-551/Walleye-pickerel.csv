It seems that some folks are not into smirks and chuckles. Walleye, pickerel, dor√©..... it's called communication. As long as the people you're speaking to understand what you're talking about, there shouldn't be a problem. A rose by any other name... Hey, and it could have been worse. It could have been called by its true accepted name which is ""zander"". Look it up, it's been verified.  Smile, it's Friday, have a super day everyone!"
