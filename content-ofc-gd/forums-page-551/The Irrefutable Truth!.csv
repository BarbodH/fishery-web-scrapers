572329,Michael_Brown,2011-04-15 00:22:00,411,"  Would not work even if they wanted to try. They have been similar efforts in the past to wipe out established invasive species, never works. Once they are there it is too late. They are harmful fish when they are invasive but once they are in, start working on the next lake.  Most pike in Balsam are 3 inches long, not 3 feet, hard to wipe out non-angling size fish with regular tackle.  The good news is the wallee population  has come back nicely in Balsam, you might even find some pickeral or Dore in there depending on what generation or province you come from.  Watch out for the pike perch and you may catch the elusive logperch if your lucky.  http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/460315/pike-perch  http://www.rook.org/earl/bwca/nature/fish/percinacap.html  "

572670,dave524,2011-04-15 19:19:00,4508,"In 1941 the name Walleye was still a pretty new handle for what was called most often a pickeral.  http://www.ontariowalleyefishing.com/walleye-biology.html  Fishing Lake Erie out of Port Colborne in the 50's with my dad, he simply referred to them as Yellows and Blues, short for Yellow and Blue Pickeral, the Americans just the other side of the Peace Bridge called them yellow and blue pike. Dad was darn good pickeral fisherman, he always trolled with a Pfluger "" Rocket"" trolling reel loaded with about 15 lb. monel wire, 3 way swivel , appropriate weight on a dropper and usually either a June Bug spinner or a Gibb's Tee-Spoon spinner with a crawler on a longish lead. He'd produce fish all summer even when others couldn't get down to them."

Dore is a colour, golden brown like roasting a marshmallow to perfection (although i like mine charcoal). I find it funny when English people call them Dore and say thats what they are called and get confused when i tell them thats the French word for walleye/pickerel."
