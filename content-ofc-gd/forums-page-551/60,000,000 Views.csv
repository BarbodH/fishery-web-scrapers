571944,Roy,2011-04-13 21:51:00,13728,"Back on December 12th 2010 I predicted that our new board would hit 60,000,000 views around mid March 2011. Well folks, it appears that we'll hit that number in two and a half days. Seeing as March has 31 days, that's about as mid March as you can get. I feel so gifted.  Thanks everyone for being a part of this great community of ours and contributing as much as you all have."
