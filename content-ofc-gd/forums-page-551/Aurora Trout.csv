573048,TJQ,2011-04-16 21:39:00,7806,"One of the things that I've devoted some time to is the saga of the aurora trout. There's really not a whole lot published on these fish and I was very excited to be able to reprint something that I don't think anyone has seen in a very long time, an actual story about a fishing expedition into the wilds of Ontario 70 years ago to find these elusive fish.  It really is a great read about how persistent these US visitors were. The story is a nice long read and if anyone is interested there's a link below. (I even threw in a couple of vintage ads to set the mood!)  http://www.auroratro...Trout-Trip.html  "

573093,TJQ,2011-04-16 23:53:00,7806, Thats a fact....

573158,Musky or Specks,2011-04-17 03:11:00,2710,Nice read Ive been twice now and haven't had a touch either time. To far to travel Ive decided that at the time of the year they are open I'd rather musky fish.
