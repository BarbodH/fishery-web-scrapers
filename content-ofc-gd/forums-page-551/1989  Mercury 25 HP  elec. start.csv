571998,lenray,2011-04-14 00:03:00,18,Have a couple of questions.  What brand name of spark plug and the gap????  What is the little toggle switch next to the choke?????  Thankyou
572005,Rattletrap2,2011-04-14 00:29:00,1652,"I had a 1986 20 HP Merc. My guess is that the plugs are permanently gapped (forget what they call these). There is just a centre pin and the threaded part of the plug surrounds it and is separated by an insulator. I would think you are referring to the kill switch that is on the motor. It must be pointed up to run. The tether is most likely missing, but if it was attached, it would knock the switch into the ""down"" position if it was yanked off the switch."

Take you old plug out and cross reference the # at CTC for all brand options of plugs.They should be pregapped from factory.A good thing to buy is a Merc manual by seloc."
