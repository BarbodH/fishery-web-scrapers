After 20 minutes of trolling around I noticed the average water temp was 38.  Then I found the mother load.  It was amazing to see was 1 degree warmer of water produced.      They were biting soooo light.  The only thing you noticed was just a slight weight difference in your rod tip.  However, they were plentiful.  I caught well over 50 in 2 hours and ended up bringing just over 20 jumbos home for dinner."

572473,skeeter,2011-04-15 11:50:00,1907,"Great report!! 2 questions for you, what time is dinner and where do you live?"
572497,Pikeslayer,2011-04-15 12:34:00,1443,"  WOW! IT'S A DOUBLE RAINBOW!!!  sorry, couldn't resist. Slayer."
572501,perchslayer666,2011-04-15 12:41:00,280,How did you get those screen shots?
572526,umKthxbye,2011-04-15 13:53:00,247, Camera and Photoshop is my guess. I do it like that too to only have the image i want and not the other background junk.
572545,Rizzo,2011-04-15 14:47:00,4754,I know that spot
572555,NAW,2011-04-15 15:18:00,4022,"I think i saw you launching at Tiffin on my way into work..  Your the second person this year to launch from there, that I've seen, and I drive by there at least 6 times a day..  I've hit the shore twice this week by the marina with a bit of luck.  Bitting ""light"" is an understatement!  Thanks for the report.  I think I'll head out one day next week once my trailer is re-built."
572583,alexmedic,2011-04-15 17:09:00,186, Actually it's an option on the HDS.  It snaps a shot of the screen and then you transfer it over via SD card.  It is really cool if you want to snap a bottom alongs with a nav. screen.
572584,alexmedic,2011-04-15 17:11:00,186,"  I launched from the city marina.  I always seem to have bad luck with those crazy steel walls at Tiffin!  If you do go out, don't worry about travelling too far from the launch though (hint hint   ).."
