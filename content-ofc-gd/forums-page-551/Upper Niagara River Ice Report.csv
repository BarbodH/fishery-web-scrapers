572607,chilli,2011-04-15 17:45:00,199,http://www.youtube.com/user/wildniagara  I'll be adding a video tonight of the river after the first few booms came out. This video was 2 days before that. Just a few cormorants in this video for your pleasure. The Upper Niagara River will be shot for at least a week now.

572863,chilli,2011-04-16 04:20:00,199,Did anyone lose a prop out there
573258,chilli,2011-04-17 15:05:00,199,OK no cormorants in the sequel. I think the nasty breaker chased them away   If you like my video's please subscribe.  BTW the Upper is toast for awhile but it's got a nice stain so if you can find an opening hit it
573268,Twocoda,2011-04-17 15:30:00,4130,excellent footage....im thinking i would like to see this in person  Thanks for taking the time to share this

Actually that wind probably prevented a clean flush and it will now take a lot longer. In the long run its probably better for the lake as it will keep the temps down longer and the Niagara River will hold the big trout longer
