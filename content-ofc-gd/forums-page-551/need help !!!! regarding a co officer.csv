My grandfather did it for years out of Port Dover. But I wouldn't just point fingers a the Canadian side in the states you can keep a fish that is spawning. But I don't agree that Commercial fisheries take the amounts they do. I think they need change things big time so that we can have the fisheries that we do."
573120,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-04-17 01:39:00,1107," Not trying to pick on ya Wayne but I took your word as the gospel LOL and got proven wrong on another board so I checked the MNR site and found this .   •Possessing more fish than permitted by your fishing licence or the fishing quota. Catch and retain and possession limits may vary by region, fisheries division, individual body of water, or even parts of a body of water. You must determine your “daily” fishing limit for the waters you intend to fish and follow these limits. Remember you may only catch your own limit – there are no provisions for “party” fishing or for excluding fish that you may have consumed or plan to consume that day.  so the OP's problem was admitting he caught over his limit not that their fish were all in 1 bucket which had nothing to do with the fine had he said he only caught part of his limit he would have been OK.BTW I went through the 2011 book and there's nothing about ""party fishing""."
573134,irishfield,2011-04-17 01:58:00,26272,"Sorry SRT.. but the issue is ""possession"". If you put two guys limits in one bucket and you're carrying the pail then you have too many fish in YOUR possession. Many have been nailed walking off Simcoe ice in that situation.  ""Party"" fishing is simply a term for doing what he admitted he was doing. Attempting to fill 3 peoples limits by catching and keeping more than his own personal daily limit.  I can't comprehend what anyone was able to prove wrong with that diagnosis, in accordance with Ontario Regs, in this situation."
573141,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-04-17 02:25:00,1107,"if your in a group and all your limits are in the same bucket, as long as all anglers are there the fish are not in your ""possesion"" just because your carrying the bucket or charter captains would get nailed every time they unload there coolers. I am sure the fine was for over his limit because he admited to keeping more than his limit to try and fill the other guys limits just my take on it next time I talk to a CO I will ask I seem to get checked more than anyone I know LOL see them all the time just goes to show ya how easy the regulations are to understand"
573148,muskymike,2011-04-17 02:51:00,772, So would it be okay then if both guys where holding the bucket together? One each had a hand on the handle? Therefore the possession would be cut in half no?
573157,strik,2011-04-17 03:11:00,175,  So i know that this is getting to far  but what if we did have them both in a sepret bucket and i got out of the car and went inot a store would the fish now not  be in the possession of the guy sitting in the car?  I have fished for years out of a bucket and never did i get charged.  Howewver i never caught aything to put in the bucket  lol

I read your above post 3 times and I'm a little confused...are you trying to say you don't agree that the commercial fishing boats should be allowed to gill net or are you saying you don't agree that they in deed take walleye and perch by the thousands ?  In NYS we are not allowed to fish walleye until after the spawning season.....but I believe you are correct with the State of Ohio allowing fishing during the spawning season.  As far as gill net size.......they use a certain size gill net to target the species they are after....nothing new there.  Bob"
573187,Big Cliff,2011-04-17 10:53:00,6899,"I think this whole thread has gone way out in left field. The guy was honest, he made an honest mistake and asked an honest question and he has taken a real bashing for it.  To be quite frank, I've been just as guilty as he was without realizing it, Sue and I have gone out fishing, she has caught her limit and continued to fish, we throw all our fish in the one live well in the boat. I didn't realize we were doing anything wrong. We've never taken our full limit but always thought we could.  I have also fished with other members of this board who shall remain nameless where they have given me some of their fish so that I would have enough for a feed when I got home. Technically we were guilty of party fishing too I guess, we just didn't get caught.  I and these other people respect and abide by the rules but I never realized that we couldn't give someone a couple of fish because that is what this boils down to.  BRF, I suggest you go to court on this one, let me know when and where, you can call me as a witness to the fact that the rules are ambiguas! I am 65, been fishing my whole life, never been charged with anything always try to abide by the rules. If I found them hard to understand then I'm sure many others do too.  And the rest of you, instead of bashing this guy for a simple mistake, why don't you offer to go to court too and testify on his behalf? If the rules need to be changed or laid out more clearly then lets do something to help make that happen.  Flagrant abuse is one thing, an honest misunderstanding is another!"
573239,MJIG,2011-04-17 14:25:00,227," I'm pretty sure that giving away fish is legal, as long as all the fish given away are counted against the single catcher's daily CATCH limit and his total catch (fish HE caught and removed from the water and did not throw back) does not exceed his daily CATCH limit. The ""given away"" fish also decrement the recipient's possession limit immediately.  If Joe catches 4 walleye one morning where the daily catch (and possession) limit is 4, I'm pretty sure he can legally give his skunked fishing buddy Fred 2 of the walleye. Joe cannot legally catch any more walleye, nor can he give any more walleye to Fred (or anyone) because he has harvested the maximum amount he is allowed for the day.  Fred, on the other hand, could go out fishing that night and legally catch and keep 2 more walleye (but not 4, because his POSSESSION limit will have been reached - 2 from Joe, 2 caught = 4). Even if Fred ate the 2 fish Joe gave him for supper that same day, he couldn't keep more than 2 fish until after midnight (start of a new day).  --"

The CO asked how the fishing was. First angler replied, ""I got 3 splake and my buddy got one"". Conversation continued and then the CO asked the angler to accompany him to the cruiser so he could write the guy a ticket on the extra splake. The CO is right and he is just doing his job. You forced his hand when you answered incorrectly.  I don't think livewells need to be separated but they sure want your answer to be legal and logical when they take a look.  Dan O."

573275,Fisherman,2011-04-17 15:47:00,7201,"I think one of the biggest problems is that a lot of anglers fail to read all of the applicable finer points of what is prohibited.  A simple step to get to those points can be accomplished by going to the MNR website(Fishing) and typing short question into the search feature at the top, i.e, ""Party Fishing"" and it will give a number of responses such as follows: Possessing more fish than permitted by your fishing licence or the fishing quota. Catch and retain and possession limits may vary by region, fisheries division, individual body of water, or even parts of a body of water. You must determine your “daily” fishing limit for the waters you intend to fish and follow these limits.

As the licenses can be sold by non-ministry staff & most are (ie: Canadian Tire, fishing/tackle shops ect.) if the retailer has not forwarded the paperwork to the ministry & or the ministry has processed it yet you may have a valid license that they have no access to validating. A charge of ""failure to produce a license"" (onus on you) is not the same as "" fishing without a license"" although the penalties may not seem to tell it."

572849,Woodsman,2011-04-16 03:15:00,1286,It depends on what record your talking about. It will not appear on a criminal records check but will appear on a check of your drivers license records if it's a speeding ticket. IIRC it's there for 3 years. Not sure haw long a Fish & Game Act convictions remains on file. Liquor License Act convictions are also available to the police if they decide to check them.

572508,Guest gbfisher,2011-04-15 13:01:00,0,As the rules Stand now. If you're fishing Muskie with a conservation license and happen to pull the fish out of the water to take a picture like just about every fisherman does. You can be fined. Same goes with pulling a fish out of the water for a picture if it is in a slot or under the leagal size of Muskie that can be kept. I say they can fine you. I doubt all CO`s would but you are left with the fact that you can be fined when taking unnessasary time to release your fish after it was caught. It is a sad fact regardless. Having to go to court to prove yourself innocent may even have you walk away with the same fine with the arguement that will entale.   As for adding more to another persons limit after you have reached yours.....Give your head a shake!  I still say that fishing has got to the point where an average person cannot just go fishing without the fact that they could be charged with an ambiguous fine.  Im done...
572522,umKthxbye,2011-04-15 13:42:00,247,Challenge it in court for a reduced fine and to have it removed from your record. If you plead guilty with an explanation the judge will cut the fine in half if not more. I always contest my parking tickets and never have to pay anything since bylaws never have proof that i was in violation which i never am. Just cuz your at fault doesn't mean you cant fight it and have a lesser fine.

If your limit was 6 fish you were done after your 6th fish.  Catch and release came along when the fish were too polluted to eat in an effort to increase tourism.  There are 2 references to culling here, is culling more than your limit now legal? I didn't think it was."

My mistake and I paid the fine and all is done. It happens, pay your fine and get on with your life. I went to court anyway and had the fine cut in 1/2.

My question is, if you guys were fishing together and the fish were all in the same pail, how did he know that you were over your personal limit?"
572422,sirfish,2011-04-15 05:36:00,175,"Good point GoneFishin,It would be safe to say that most are guilty of keeping fishing after thier limit, But of course the ""notme"" gnome in all of us will defend us. What I don't get is..Having ""the groups"" catch in the white bucket is the same as having the groups catch in a livewell,which is OK....double/double..Hmmmm . Another thing is did the CO watch him catch and count all his fish?,I think not. We might have an interpretation issue here. This is a matter that is worth a court date.You might be surprised at the result. Curious to hear how it turns out. Bye the Bye..IMO .why is it when a thread like this is posted a guy is made to feel like the sacraficial lamb?"
572434,Terry,2011-04-15 09:10:00,14456," well sure, if he wants to take a day and go to court, I don't think they will change the charge but they will reduce the fine..  what criminal would try to get off or a reduced sentence ....."
572438,Fishnwire,2011-04-15 10:25:00,983,  That's what I don't understand.
572439,bigredfisher,2011-04-15 10:31:00,300,"I was honest, and said how fish were split up.... But he never counted the fish.... As I offered"
572443,mercman,2011-04-15 10:59:00,7054,"a mistake is a mistake.At least BRF was honest a forthcoming with the MNR.There are tagging systems available for culling, with differnt colored tags.You could get a couple of these, and use them to identify the fish when more than 1 person in the boat with you. I think it was an honest mistake, made by an honest man.If not i'm sure he would never have posted that here."
572447,solopaddler,2011-04-15 11:10:00,8605,"Considering the circumstances I don't think what you did was horribly wrong.  Connie was right though, you picked the wrong forum to complain in.  Do as Bill said, go to court and talk to the crown, it'll be well worth your while."
572455,pikehunter,2011-04-15 11:22:00,1659,"Just as Fishlogic said.  Go to court, explain your case and hope for the best.  It never hurts to go over the regs wth a fine tooth comb and then try to remember them. The C.O did do his job so you can't falt hom for that. Like everything else in this country you have to understand the laws. For your sake I hope you don't end up with a record and that is why if you are right or wrong you have to put together a good defence for court. Good luck to you and next time read the regs. If you don't get it then ask here or even better get proper clarification first.  BTW nothing wrong with a conservation license but follow the lower limit rules. I have bought both, one time I get the sport and next time renewel comes around and I say to heck with it I never keep the limit so why bother. Then I get the conservation permit and wish I bought a sport. Go  figure eh? Right now I'm on the 2nd. year of a 3 year conservation permit."
572459,lew,2011-04-15 11:36:00,12766," Your allowed to fish for them, you just can't keep one."
572463,lookinforwalleye,2011-04-15 11:40:00,4399," Lets not have this debate again!   No where in the regulations does it say conservation license holders are not allowed to fish for Musky, unless they re-wrote the regs this year!"
572464,Spiel,2011-04-15 11:41:00,9065,  That's why I get a sportsman license Lew.
572466,strik,2011-04-15 11:42:00,175,.why is it when a thread like this is posted a guy is made to feel like the sacraficial lamb?     WOW the two best things said  This is going to change how I ice fish no more pail for us it was so easy to toss the fish in one pail for the way home.  It seem the only reason he was charged is because he told the Co   he could have Lied and said some of his catch was his dads   Wish it was time to go fishing  Best of luck all   
572468,lookinforwalleye,2011-04-15 11:45:00,4399," Probably because a law was broken, perhaps it was an honest mistake but hey the CO was doing his job!"
572472,skeeter,2011-04-15 11:47:00,1907," I agree with mercman on this one! POOP happens. Go to court, you cant win if you dont go.  ""What about conservation license holders....not allowed to fish for musky?"" If your license says ""O"" fish then no you cant. That would be the same as saying, I dont have a fishing license but I'm not keeping any fish so thats ok.  your right Spiel, i should have added  , if the regs say catch limit 0."
572474,Spiel,2011-04-15 11:50:00,9065, Wrong.
572477,HTHM,2011-04-15 11:56:00,4082,"OH!, LOOK a can of worms....let's open it!"
572478,lew,2011-04-15 11:57:00,12766," Absolutely Chris, ya hafta keep those big girls legal for the BBQ"
572484,aplumma,2011-04-15 12:07:00,6896,The truth of the matter is the C.O. is not judging you as guilty he is taking a report from what he sees and hears and putting it down as a violation. The decision is the judges as to your guilt or innocents.When you bought the license you were given an opportunity to see all of the rules and by signing the license you are telling them you understand and will comply with the rules. It is up to you to know the rules to prevent you from getting a ticket from the C.O. If you do not read the rules or if you did not call them for clarity on a rule then you are guilty. Send them the $180.00 and don't waste a days wages in court on top of it.Getting a ticket is not personal it is one man doing the job you hired him to do with the money you spent for your license.   Art
572485,lookinforwalleye,2011-04-15 12:10:00,4399,"    All you guys that think you can`t Musky fish with a conservation license please show me where it say this, if you would actually take the time to read the regulations you will see it`s quite the opposite!"
572487,Fisherman,2011-04-15 12:25:00,7201,Amen Art
572488,Tom McCutcheon,2011-04-15 12:25:00,627," Correct Lew.  With a Conservation License, they have to be released boatside. Once you bring it in the boat for measurements and pictures it is now in your posession and against the regs."
572489,cheaptackle,2011-04-15 12:26:00,849,"Go to court. Plead guilty with an explanation. Say you were wrong, have further researched the regulations and found out where you were wrong and have ALTERED YOUR FISHING HABITS ACCORDINGLY. The worst case scenario is what you already know - fine and conviction no matter what. The best is a ""suspended sentence"", keep your nose clean afterwards and no fine, no record unless you re-offend. I was young once too, that's what I did and have been doing ever since with no further reprisals. Oh, and make sure you do alter your habits and don't re-offend, I have no experience with that aspect....  Michael"
572490,Pikeslayer,2011-04-15 12:26:00,1443,Looks like it's going to be a miserable weekend weather wise. Wet & windy all over.
572494,express168,2011-04-15 12:31:00,327,"  Truth is the CO doesn't need to prove the over limit, the simple fact that neither of those fishing could identify which fish in the pail were theirs they are all in violation of the regs and you have technically violated the limits by not being able to identify which catch is yours.  Unfortunate situation, but a violation is a violation whether you were aware or not."
572346,bigredfisher,2011-04-15 01:43:00,300,"hey i was at scugog today. i was with my dad and another buddy from the board making our limit 70 (i have a conservation licence). We were all thowing the fish we were catching into one pail, anyways my question is can i not catch more than my limit and ""give"" them to my dad or buddy as long as its within their limits??? It was a 180 dollar fine and i dont need this crap on my record(i am one to pick up garbage, take mine with me,and volunteer in fish lifts and such).... what can i do here?? am i in the wrong???"
572347,irishfield,2011-04-15 01:45:00,26272,"""Party"" fishing is illegal in Ontario... they got ya fair and square!  Also.. everyone needs their catch seperate or immediately identifiable. Paper punch thru a tail fin would probably hold up in court."
572349,lookinforwalleye,2011-04-15 01:51:00,4399,"Like Wayne said no party fishing, nice to see our Co`s out doing there job!"
572353,Big Cliff,2011-04-15 01:54:00,6899," Sorry, yes you are in the wrong! If I may ask. Why did you buy a conservation license anyway?"
572354,Nipfisher,2011-04-15 01:54:00,2449,You had to stop fishing(or target another open species) when you reached your limit. Why do you only have a conservation licence?
572355,vinnimon,2011-04-15 01:55:00,2593,"Catching and keeping beyond you limit ,hmmmm? Then to pass them off,,,,,,NO! Im curious as if there is a special permit to do so threw the mnr. Like a group tag . Hmmm...."
572358,bigredfisher,2011-04-15 02:00:00,300,i bought the conservation cause i dont normally keep fish.
572359,irishfield,2011-04-15 02:02:00,26272,  LOL.. but this time you wanted to be able to catch and keep 4 to 7 times YOUR limit??!
572360,Terry,2011-04-15 02:05:00,14456,bottom line is you broke the law......  you would have a hard time fighting it in court
572361,bigredfisher,2011-04-15 02:05:00,300,no i gave my dad some to fill his limit (i was geeting more)
572363,lookinforwalleye,2011-04-15 02:05:00,4399,  Ya thats a big
572364,spinnerbaitking,2011-04-15 02:08:00,1622,"I believe once you catch your limit you need to target another species or quit fishing, quit keeping one short of your limit just to be sure your legal SBK "
572365,bigredfisher,2011-04-15 02:08:00,300,by the way never said i kept 7 times my limit
572367,Ron,2011-04-15 02:12:00,1683,GUILTY!  Book em Dano.
572368,Nipfisher,2011-04-15 02:13:00,2449,  That's what I thought SBK. You can catch and release before you reach your limit but not after...except if fish are alive and in a live well and you are culling to keep the best fish for your limit?  I'm guessing your dad nor EC1 knew the regs either. It was a mistake but you'll have to pay the fine.
572370,TennesseeGuy,2011-04-15 02:17:00,957,"Hey Pal, you picked the wrong forum to make your confession.  These boys can be brutal."
572376,BillM,2011-04-15 02:28:00,17367, No he won't..  He'd be silly not to go to court and plead to a lessor charge or at least a reduced fine.  They'll give it to him without issue.
572380,mercman,2011-04-15 02:34:00,7054,"I have no doubt that you made a mistake, and were not intentionally keeping more than your limit.But the MNRs have heard it all before, and that is why you got the ticket.When i am fishing with someone, i always ask to see their permit, so i know what kind they have, and i always try to be aware of the regulations in the area where i fish."
572381,adempsey,2011-04-15 02:35:00,1498,"If you can, I would just challenge it.  It sounds like it's a first offence and maybe you'll come out for the better as a result.   It can't get worse besides the potential time away from work.   Honestly, I don't think you purposely were trying to break the law and what you were doing seems logical to most people.  Unfortunately these types of laws are in place because there are people who would take advantage of it - give fish to each of their family members etc to ""reset"" their limit.  At least the CO didn't confiscate your gear.  Good luck!"
572385,Fisherman,2011-04-15 02:47:00,7201,"Well they did take advantage of it, and it would appear that neither took the time to read the regs concerning party fishing.  You see it pays to read and heed rather than hope and be a _______. You fill in the blank."
572392,EC1,2011-04-15 03:08:00,930,"I guess I have to make an apology too for not knowing that you can't put everyone's fish into the same bucket.  BUT, at the same time, I don't think I've ever asked someone what type of license they're holding. Nipfisher, I think it's a little bit of an assumption that I don't know my limit though.  There was a total of 57 fish in between us, I took 18, and the rest were Bigredfisher and his dad. If the numbers we counted were correct, there should be 39 fish in their possession (under the 40 that was legal).  I apologize for not making 100% sure of our limits before hand. I had an awesome time today...but this pretty much turned that upside down."
572397,kickingfrog,2011-04-15 03:18:00,8333,"I know party fishing is against the law.  In the past, I also cannot guarantee none of my fish have counted against my boat mates fish or vis versa. I'm not as pure as most it appears.  We now use a stringer with 4 marked hooks each, as wall-eye (you can kiss my   on the word censor) on Nipissing is about the only place we are likely to keep a limit.  Edit: Try spelling wall-eye without the hyphen and see what happens. It's one thing to be wrong and ill informed but childish, come on."
572400,ADB,2011-04-15 03:24:00,444,"Sometimes inexperience is exactly that...inexperience.  You gotta learn sometime.  I've been fishing for years but I never knew that you had to keep your fish seperate from the fish of the other people in the boat.  Then again, I hardly ever keep fish anyways.  Seems like an honest mistake to me.  If you believe their numbers, at least there were under the aggregate limit between the three of them."
572407,brifishrgy,2011-04-15 03:38:00,559,time to go pick up an extra white bucket and a hole punch for when I am in the boat   and ya a wall-eye will always be a wall-eye no matter what these sensors say
572413,fishindude,2011-04-15 04:31:00,220,"Glad to see the CO's doing their job, seems as if there is almost a daily report of them out there lately  Sorry to hear about your misfortune. I, like many others here as well, was unaware of the regulations regarding the limits and this so-called ""party fishing,"" just another perk to this forum. Will definitely keep this in mind next time I'm group fishing and keeping a limit."
