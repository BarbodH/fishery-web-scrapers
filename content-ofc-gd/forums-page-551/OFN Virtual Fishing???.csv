I got to thinking in my downtime about an idea that may help alot of anglers, but also generate some posts from other board members, which is always a good thing.  Ok, Here is the idea. Every week, we post up a body of water in Ontario. We post up the days time, conditions, etc, as well as one species of fish. Then members can chime in about what they would do to have a successful outing. The member could be vague, but emphasis would be put on being as detailed as possible.  This way members of the board could ""get into another anglers mind"", so to speak. I think it would be an excellent learning tool. At the end of a pre-determined time frame, we could then vote on a member who had ""the most helpful contributions"", and that member would earn a prize package.  Any thoughts? Ideas etc? Feel free to chime in  Maybe I just had a few too many and this is actually a horrible idea? lol"
