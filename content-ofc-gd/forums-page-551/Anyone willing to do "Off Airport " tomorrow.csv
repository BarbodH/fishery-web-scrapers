572920,nofish4me,2011-04-16 14:32:00,404,"Temagami, or grass strip behind Cobalt Truck Stop, or there is always Englehart Airport. Wife needs to get to Cobalt tomorrow. She always said, she would never fly with me and she's stickin' to it. Hahaha This is gonna cost me, somehow, I know.  Just thought I'd post, that, she wouldn't ever fly with me, I'm sure she wouldn't go with someone she didn't know (well maybe she would) Hahaha"
572956,vance,2011-04-16 16:26:00,719,I will phone my ex and see if her broom is still working.  :rofl2:  vance
572959,irishfield,2011-04-16 16:39:00,26272,Does hers do IFR Vance... as they'll need it tomorrow!!  Temagami... 20 inches of ice still on lake!  Cobalt... is that grass strip even still there or useable?  Earlton.. be quicker to just drive to Cobalt in the first place.  If you time it right.. just land on #11 and pull into the truck stop on the corner.  Heck NF4Me... it's just a nice 4.5 hour Sunday drive !
572968,nofish4me,2011-04-16 17:05:00,404," 4.5 hrs., form Barrie area, I agree. I've made the trip 3 times in the last month. I don't mind the drive, have done it many times in all weather for many years, but I have noticed the lack of trucks, etc. on the road. I swear, no matter what, if the trucks aren't truckin', the economy isn't as good as we are being told."
572971,irishfield,2011-04-16 17:10:00,26272,Check my camp when you go by.....
572976,nofish4me,2011-04-16 17:29:00,404, Place was still there last weekend. Ice was still at the shore. Snowmobiles loading up and heading out. Someone bought all the choclate cookies at Subway.
572978,Nipfisher,2011-04-16 17:33:00,2449,You can stop in and visit us in North Bay?
572981,nofish4me,2011-04-16 17:40:00,404, I told her to take her own. She didn't see the humour. I'm gonna pay for this.
572995,nofish4me,2011-04-16 18:24:00,404," Thanks. I'll keep this in the back of my mind. It's always nice to travel and know that you're welcome to stay somewhere, if need be. By any chance, you wouldn't happen to know a Matthews, the one that owns the tranny shop."
573020,Bernie,2011-04-16 20:32:00,3190,"I know Paul Matthews. He operates the auto repair shop there, not the transmission shop."
573075,nofish4me,2011-04-16 23:07:00,404," First time I met him, we were both living at Laurentian U. (a long time ago) Been a long time since I've seen him, always think of him when I drive up 11 and see his shop. Actually stopped by his brothers shop in New Liskard, last weekend.  Wife decided on the Northlander, time's an issue, but the $400 extra to fly only part way (North Bay), makes the train much more palitable. (I'm of Scottish heritage)"
573079,irishfield,2011-04-16 23:16:00,26272,Train is.or was.. not in service !!! Derailment on the 12th and they were busing from North Bay to Cochrane!  http://www.ottertooth.com/Temagami/News/11/derailment.htm
573102,nofish4me,2011-04-17 00:19:00,404,"  Yes, that's correct. We concidered this and it's hard to get any closer than the the train stop, but the Bus will actually be several feet closer."
573246,nofish4me,2011-04-17 14:41:00,404," Nipfisher, did I make you nervous?  Not sure why, or how, I interpreted that to mean stay. Hahaha"
573284,nofish4me,2011-04-17 16:00:00,404,"Can't seem to insert media from this Laptop. I've had this song in my head all morning. It doesn't really apply, but the end result is the same. It's an old Roy Clark tune; Thank God and Greyhound She's Gone.  I will surely miss her by the end of the week though."
