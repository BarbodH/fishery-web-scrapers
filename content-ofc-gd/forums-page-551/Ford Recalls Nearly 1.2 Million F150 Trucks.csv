573040,BillM,2011-04-16 21:25:00,17367," Why would GM try and reinvent the diesel after the 6.5?  That might probably be the worst engine, ever.  Instead they get a tried and true powerplant with the Duramax and combined it with easily the best transmission on the market.  If you ask me, they did it right."
573049,Fisherman,2011-04-16 21:44:00,7201,"If they had been really smart they would have married Cummins and then wouldn't have had to pay out the extra for Isuzu, but noooo, they had to be stoopid and after that last fiasco I had, I'd rent a non GM taxi with a hitch to pull my boat before I bought another(any) GM product."
573051,BillM,2011-04-16 21:52:00,17367,"I'm sure GM is really heartbroken about the fact you won't buy another GM product   The Duramax/Allison combo is killer, at least they learned from their mistakes."
573109,Billy Bob,2011-04-17 01:04:00,5865,Maybe not heartbroken.......but they did go BROKE....  I know I learned my lesson never to purchase another GM vehicle...

573453,johnny13,2011-04-18 00:21:00,38,"if you look at my profile picture, look at the type of truck. never gave us a problem."
573456,danc,2011-04-18 00:25:00,4677,"Air bag light has been on, on my 96 for a year or so now. I guess I'll get it fixed to get through the next 15 years til it dies."
573458,johnny13,2011-04-18 00:30:00,38,why do you need an airbag? they don't go that fast..
573462,danc,2011-04-18 00:31:00,4677, Cuz it might save my life?? DUH!!!
573465,johnny13,2011-04-18 00:39:00,38,"Air bag light has been on, on my 96 for a year or so now. I guess I'll get it fixed to get through the next 15 years til it dies.  don't wait another year DUH!"
573468,danc,2011-04-18 00:46:00,4677, Wish I could take back my 30 years of driving before airbags were invented. I'd probably still be alive.
573473,johnny13,2011-04-18 00:59:00,38,Wish I could take back my 30 years of driving before airbags were invented. I'd probably still be alive.  Why are you dead?
572158,craigdritchie,2011-04-14 15:29:00,1586,"Ah yes, another month, and another vehicle recall. You would think that at some point, one of these guys would figure out it's cheaper to build the vehicle right in the first place.  The latest - Ford is recalling nearly 1.2 million 2004 to 2006 F150 pickups for faulty air bags. Click here to read all about it."
572161,misfish,2011-04-14 15:39:00,29133,"WHEW, mine a 97."
572162,Rich Clemens,2011-04-14 15:44:00,3131,"Whew ... my 2009 should be safe. But, I did get a notice about something wrong with the door handles.  Waiting a follow-up notice when the parts are available."
572166,Mike Pike,2011-04-14 15:56:00,1332,Impossible to keep pushing out millions of vehicles without having any problems years down the road.  I judge the manufacture by what they do once they find out there IS a problem.  Fixing the vehicle and providing a loaner as good as you can expect.
572169,lew,2011-04-14 16:05:00,12766, My 2010 is safe too Rich but I'm also affected like you on the door issue. I had a letter from Ford saying the parts should start becoming available in May.
572170,Squid,2011-04-14 16:16:00,1656,Ahhh  nothing like a GMC
572172,lew,2011-04-14 16:30:00,12766,You won't be laffing so much when the wheels fall off that clunker Pete
572190,Squid,2011-04-14 17:34:00,1656,
572193,Peps,2011-04-14 17:37:00,191,just made it here 07 for me
572213,blaque,2011-04-14 18:17:00,2419,2010 here and havent heard a peep about door handles???
572285,Beans,2011-04-14 21:54:00,3339, And mines a 1995...too bad the recall isn't for rust...   
572310,skeeter,2011-04-14 23:38:00,1907," Don't worry Lew, just leave the window open and pull the Dukes of Hazard entry !!    A Ford with rust??"
572418,Fish Farmer,2011-04-15 05:05:00,2234,"One thing with the Fords, they don't want them on the rezz Looks like I have to drive mine with my ATV helmet with shield till I get it in 05 here, haven't got my letter yet. Mite have to push my seat back."
572462,TroutnMuskieHunter,2011-04-15 11:39:00,1362,04 here and no letter yet either....guess I'll drive around with a sharp knife by my side.
572520,Billy Bob,2011-04-15 13:33:00,5865,Happy TUNDRA owner here....
572543,kenzy31,2011-04-15 14:46:00,261,"hmmm.. guess that's why my airbag light has been on for nearly 2 years!  scanner returned no faults both times i had it checked though so i wasn't sure where to turn.  mine also has a specific flash pattern before it stays on solid but what i was able to find online didn't match my particular pattern.  hopefully Barrie Ford can fix the problem with no hassle, maybe throw in a 2012 'Stang for a loaner"
572558,blaque,2011-04-15 15:33:00,2419, More than happy F-150 owner here.
572560,Billy Bob,2011-04-15 15:36:00,5865,Some are much easier to please then others....
572565,lookinforwalleye,2011-04-15 16:01:00,4399,  So you are the guy who bought a Tundra!!!
572582,Billy Bob,2011-04-15 17:06:00,5865," YEP, that's me sitting head and shoulders above you while I cruise by your local repair shop as you pray they can fix your truck...again..."
572691,blaque,2011-04-15 20:52:00,2419,"They all break down, this one was on the way home from the dealer with 400 miles on it  "
572698,Fisherman,2011-04-15 21:16:00,7201,"400, that's not that bad, I didn't have 100km on my last truck when it started its routine of constantly breaking down, the marvellous GM 6.5 state of art electronic fuelled diesel.  Right from day one to the bitter end, and if GM was the last western block truck maker, I'd by a Mahindra from India.  If it wasn't for Isuzu, GM still wouldn't have a reasonable diesel."
572983,johnny13,2011-04-16 17:55:00,38,"should have bought a Chevy. but dont worry fords are through away vehicles. there like a tim hortons coffee cup through it out and buy another one. at least they've circled the problem!! http://www.google.ca...p=10&ved=1t:429,r:2,s:0&tx=92&ty=31    http://failblog.org/...-flawless-fail/"
