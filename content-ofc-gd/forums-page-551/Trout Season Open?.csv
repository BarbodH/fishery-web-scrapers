573319,Twocoda,2011-04-17 16:53:00,4130,confirmed!!! make sure you read the regs of the stream your going to be fishing...so you dont end up fishing in a sanctuary
573326,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-04-17 17:13:00,1107,  I'm pretty sure it's been worded the 4th saturday for a few years now hopefully most of the once or twice a year opener fisherman will miss this and wait till the next saturday
573336,tributaryhunter,2011-04-17 17:46:00,108," lets hope so, i doubt it though, it should be good this year, being their coming up later, and it hasn't been warm enough yet"
573354,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-04-17 18:54:00,1107,  Yeah lots of fresh fish around I kinda hope the waters high and dirty to protect the big girls that are still on redds should be a good year though.
