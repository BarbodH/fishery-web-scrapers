566602,Moosebunk,2011-03-27 20:19:00,3970," Right On Dan!  It would certainly be a trip that would find its way back home here to Ontario, and one report that would be owed ""big time"" to many.  Less than a week of hoping to hold on.  Support if you can with any votes.  Thanks.     Dave... liking the Innis & Gunn of late."

566624,darsky,2011-03-27 20:58:00,586,Bunk-is it a certainty that you WILL get the trip if your article ends up with the most votes??
566648,Moosebunk,2011-03-27 21:59:00,3970," To quote the contest rules sent in email to past guests...  ... ""The story with the most ""likes"" will win a trip to any Plummer's Lodge, anytime in the summer of 2011.  Contest closes March 31st...   That sounds like a ""WILL"" to me Darsky."

563222,Moosebunk,2011-03-19 00:22:00,3970,"Hi All.  I have a huge favor to ask anyone and everyone who has ever enjoyed a Moosebunk report.  I need your ""like"" which is basically a vote.  For a number of years I have pumped out fishing reports to several Ontario fishing boards.  It's a labor of love, something I do for myself as much as others.  Countless hours as many know, have gone into writing and sharing photos online with other anglers.  One report in particular always stood out as my favorite, and that was when Brenda and I shared a trip to Plummer's Arctic Lodge in the NWT.  The original report I spread online for everyone was 90 photos and 11,000 words.  Quite an undertaking.  After that post, Big Jim approached me to ask I rewrite that report into 3000 words for his magazine ""Just Fishing.""  We had to settle on a 6000 word piece to be run over two issues.  I donated what was arguably my best written work to Jim for this, in thanks for him for running the article.  Later, Plummer's asked if they could use my online report for reprint in their magazine Arctic Lure, I was happy to grant this request.  Some time passed when later a friend of mine caught my picture in a magazine.  A char photo was an advertisement for Plummer's.  Just in that trip experience alone I have worked a ridiculous amount of time and enjoyed every minute.  17,000 words and 90 photos is equivalent to 7-10 feature articles in a magazine like Outdoor Canada.  My payment was simply the satisfaction and pleasure of it for myself and others.  PLUMMER'S ARCTIC LODGES HAS A STORY CONTEST ON RIGHT NOW AVAILABLE TO PAST GUESTS AND I HAVE MADE A SUBMISSION.  ALLOWED 750 WORDS I HAVE DESCRIBED MY 2008 TRIP THERE AS THE CONTEST GUIDELINES REQUEST.  THE PERSON'S STORY WHICH RECEIVES THE MOST ""LIKES"" AT THEIR WEBSITE, WINS A RETURN TRIP.  IT'S AT THIS TIME, I BEG ANY OF YOU TO PLEASE GIVE ME YOUR VOTE AND ALLOW ME TO RELIVE PLUMMER'S AGAIN, SO I MIGHT RETURN BACK TO YOU ALL WITH ANOTHER GREAT STORY TO TELL.  GO TO THIS LINK PROVIDED AND BELOW MY STORY WHICH IS TITLED,  ""LYING BENEATH THE DREAM GIVING TREE.""
