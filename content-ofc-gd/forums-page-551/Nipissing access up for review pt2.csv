A staff report is expected to set out exactly how and when the review will be conducted. It comes after municipal politicians asked staff to complete a review of city owned accesses and make recommendations about how best to utilize the lands.  The issue is expected to be controversial with some council members open to looking at the possible sale of access points that aren't well used or that have been taken over by abutting homeowners. Others members, meanwhile, have already vowed not to sell any public access points.  There are approximately 45 city-owned access points. Some are road allowances, including those encroached upon by abutting property owners, and others that haven't been maintained."
