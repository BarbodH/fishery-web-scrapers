573372,vinnimon,2011-04-17 20:12:00,2593," Nice to see you again as always Bruce, as well as loonietoon. I was like a kid in a candy store Way too tempting too go nuts on new to me gear. It was also nice to chat with Jose as well  Out of all the hats that were there, my youngest had to pick out a bright orange hunting cap To each there own I guess."
