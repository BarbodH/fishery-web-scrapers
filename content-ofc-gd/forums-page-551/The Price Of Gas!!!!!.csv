573163,Musky or Specks,2011-04-17 03:30:00,2710,It a small thing but if everyone did it I believe it would have some effect. I put only 10 bucks worth of gas in my vehicle at a time unless I'm going somewhere. Decreasing demand is the only way to hurt the oil companies.
573170,John Bacon,2011-04-17 04:17:00,3277, How is that going to decrease demand?  You will just have to fill up more often.
573195,mrpike,2011-04-17 12:27:00,151,IAM not voting at all until. I hear them talking about the gas prices.  ITS TIME TO DO SOMETHING.    WANT to really mess them all up ..     	VOTE for the   BLOC. 	HELL YA!!!.

573212,Terry,2011-04-17 13:30:00,14456,well everyone could just write on their Ballot I vote For Lower Gas Prices Diesel too  that would screw them up

Plus it costs anywhere from about $6000.00 more (Honda) to $12,000.00 more (Volt) to save from up to $250.00 to a max of $1000.00 a year on fuel costs? Or trade in your guzzler, at a cost of $10,000+ and save maybe $1200.00 to $1500.00+ a year on fuel. I'm gonna keep driving my Montana van, slower & a lot less, and save a few bucks. When I bought it new, (2008) it cost about $75.00 for a fill-up from near bone dry, yesterday . . . 	$117.00!  P. S.  Has ANYONE out there ever checked out the cost of the replacement and availability of the hybrid battery system?"

If you can manage not getting arrested long enough, the station will close down....YOU WIN!!!!!!!!! now you need to drive out of town for gas  jjcanoe"
573241,Burtess,2011-04-17 14:27:00,901,"My situation lately is going to reduce my fuel costs by about $120 per month.  My '04 Buick LeSabre (24.2mpg calculated) was written off a couple weeks ago (not my fault yay!) so I bought a '11 Chevrolet Cruze with a manual shift (so far 32mpg average after 1500Km).  I drive about 60,000Km per year so this will drop the costs.  At the same time the company increased our mileage allowance by 5Â¢ per Km..... so its getting cheaper for me to drive even though the fuel prices are going up up up....  Burt"
573243,Terry,2011-04-17 14:28:00,14456, well  I traded in a gas guzzler for a diesel burner.....  first week I saved 57 bucks in fuel........so each month I will save enough to pay the small loan I took out to buy the used(new to me) fuel efficient vehicle.... plus it is 8 years newer so it should have less repairs and more dependable ...  in some cases it makes sense to get rid of the money pit...
573431,John Bacon,2011-04-17 23:37:00,3277," A colleague of mine was told that it would cost $7,000 to replace the battery in a Prius.  I am not if she had accurate information or not."

572819,danc,2011-04-16 01:46:00,4677,Light Sweet Crude Oil is a commodity. It's price is dictated by the stock market. Either jump on the bandwagon or don't. But complaining will get you nowhere.
572820,timmeh,2011-04-16 01:50:00,609," Bingo. Unfortunately I agree with you, not the best way to get lower prices but this is what will happen. I think we're going to see this up and down cycle for the next few years or so."

I see a nation with fewer people paying taxes and a lot more crime. A lot of people will have little other choice."
572869,rdjrowley,2011-04-16 09:15:00,13,The oil companies are going to charge all they can get from all of us. My question is why we pay more than customers in the good old USA. Mr. Harper states we are better off (Bull)!. He gets elected because of the big money from Alberta and Corperate greed. These people will cost us many more thousands of jobs and much more if they are in power and don't stop this fraud.
572870,Big Cliff,2011-04-16 10:09:00,6899,"It is in our government's best interest to see prices kept high, we are taxed on a percentage of what we spend, the higher the price, the more we pay in taxes. I don't have the exact number but I believe it is something in the range of 15 billion a year as of last year. If prices were to drop to $0.50 a liter they would loose billions in tax revenu. You are going to pay it one way or the other.  Same thing with tobacco sales, they spend millions of dollars to make us believe that people shouldn't smoke but tax you on the stop smoking aids. Taxes on tobacco currently provide about 7 billion a year to the government coffers.  If they really wanted you to stop smoking they'd be supplying the stop smoking aids for a fraction of what they cost you now or at least remove the taxes on them. Think about it? How many billions would they loose in tax revenu if smoking was reduced by even 50%.  Someone has to pay for all those big pay cheques and fat pensions that our politicans get, When prices go up they just give themselves raises, we just dig deeper.  Democracy as far as I am concerned is just a dictatorship with many heads. Doesn't matter who you vote for, the end result is always the same! They can lie, steal, cheat, take kick backs, line their pockets, and there is no accountability even when they are caught."

I don't remember last time i walked into a grocery store and spend under 70 bucks and walked out with nothing but basics really.  Its retarded that you need 300 dollars to fill up 2 jeeps and a boat when it takes you a week to make it after everybody takes their cut. There will be a tipping point again and another recession will come and us people will suffer.  It just cant continue going like this for too too much longer
