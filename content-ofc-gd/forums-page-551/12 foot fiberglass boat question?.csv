I didn't get the ownership is that going to be a problem?What do you need to fish legally at night from it lights flares etc any answers would help its my first boat."
572877,ChrisK,2011-04-16 11:51:00,2772,"Canadian Tire sells a boaters safety kit in a small bucket  that has everything you will need other than life jackets,oars and an anchor with the correct length of rope. The second link below also has an anchor in its kit if I'm not mistaken. You can also buy clamp on bow and stern lights for night fishing. http://www.canadiantire.ca/AST/browse/5/SportsRec/Marine/MarineSafety/PRD~0790041P/Fox%252B40%252BMarine%252BSafety%252BKit.jsp?locale=en http://www.canadiantire.ca/AST/browse/5/SportsRec/Marine/MarineSafety/PRD~0790043P/Fox%252B40%252BDeluxe%252BMarine%252BSafety%252BKit.jsp?locale=en http://www.marineengine.com/products/accessory.php?in=1144259 http://www.marineengine.com/products/accessory.php?in=1142603  Not sure about the ownership and registration on a 12 footer. I'm sure someone will chime in...."
572890,mercman,2011-04-16 12:47:00,7054,"As ChrisK said, CT has kits available really cheap this time of year.Dont forget anchor and suitable rope. Here in Qubec at least, you do not need to register a boat with 9.9hp or less motor.The trailer however, needs to be plated and registered. If it is already, you need to transfer it to your name."
572921,Pikeslayer,2011-04-16 14:33:00,1443,"http://www.boaterexam.com/canada/  Sorry, not trying to be a smarty pants , but all your boating related questions can be found on the above link. You will need your operators card anyway, so this would be a good opportunity to start the study process. As far as insurance goes, you need to have registered ownership to insure it for sure.  Regards, Slayer."

572929,johnl,2011-04-16 14:56:00,197,"if i'm just throwing it in the back of my truck so theres no trailer and putting a 9.9 hp motor or less on it do i need the ownership ,i'm pretty sure i don't need to ensure it?"
572943,ChrisK,2011-04-16 15:41:00,2772,"John, I just bought a 14ft square stern fiberglass canoe and I'm not doing anything special with it other than puting some horsey's on the transom some day. I do have a boaters card though and thats the only thing I'd be concerned about in your case."

572993,Fisherman,2011-04-16 18:20:00,7201,"Proof of ownership of some sort is required, bill of sale from the last owner or from a dealer.  Go read the regulations and then you can't say "" someone told me"" or ""I heard""  go read. Does the licence prove the ownership of my pleasure craft?  A licence does not prove that you own your pleasure craft. You must carry separate ownership documents with you."
573002,POLLIWOGG,2011-04-16 18:42:00,835,"It might be a good idea to license the boat, without a set of #'s it might be a cop magnet and if it is already licensed and has #'s they should be updated to the new owner.  You'll also need the operators card, try The Canadian Power and Sail Squadron in your area. And you'll need ID with a picture so any fishing license or operators card can be linked to you. Those safety kits are bare minimum so don't be afraid to upgrade a bit."
