212340,007,2008-06-07 20:26:00,537,"Guys,  You've got it lucky.  Over here in the UK normal unleaded petrol (gas) costs 1.15 British Pounds per litre, which at the current exchange rate ($2 = 1 GBP) equals $2.30 per litre!!  While there might be some difference in salaries over here I'm certainly not paid twice what I was when I worked in Toronto doing the same job so in comparison we've got it much worse than you guys!  I believe of tax we pay on petrol over here is about 70% of the cost.  Just spare us a thought next time you fill up at your price!  Cheers 007"
212389,danc,2008-06-07 23:55:00,4677,I paid $1.06 last night. Thanks to Sis's magic card. $1.21 without a card on the res that is a half mile from my house. $1.35 or so everywhere else in town.
212390,danbouck,2008-06-07 23:58:00,4380, Yes but it still saves money if I get it 20 cents less when the price is lower
212867,holdfast,2008-06-09 01:57:00,1813,"You'll be in my thoughts next time you guys Riot, that's the only way government would listen.  There are some thinkers up here in Sask that want a board of inquiry on why prices are up. The excuses of more consumption by China, or Low oil stocks do not justify the prices.  The stock exchanges are jumping prices up on assumptions.  Again no justification.  Unlike you guys in Europe, we Canadians travel long distances to work as we are mostly Rural Nation.  So if anybody says it could be worse, look at Europe, they deserve, well Ill be nice. One last thing, oil comes out of our ground, changes hands outside our country, then comes back to our pumps, to rob us again."
212022,Clampet,2008-06-06 22:28:00,1947,Just a heads up.
212024,Canuck2fan,2008-06-06 22:30:00,1444,OK but umm why is it going to go DOWN to 1.30 at midnight?
212026,misfish,2008-06-06 22:32:00,29133,"Dont care,govermint dont, so why should I.  Think thier talking about gas prices. LOL http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnsXi0zBzoc...feature=related"
212056,Marko,2008-06-06 23:19:00,854,"wrong word crooks, its never enough. They have made enough money in 4 months this year to last them for 50 generations, why do u feel the need to make more, isnt that enough???? Read in the news yesterday, some lady was arrested down south i think for setting couple of gas stations on fire. She said she was trying to do something about gas prices so she set gas pumps on fire LOL. Suprised not more people are doing it, or doing anything really."
212058,dsn,2008-06-06 23:20:00,1018,They were predicting gas prices this 2008 summer would hit $1.40 in the winter months of 2007. So it's getting up there.
212065,Mike the Pike,2008-06-06 23:26:00,3421,Welcome to my world Paul $1.41 here in Montreal it was $1.45 Wednesday.  When is the bubble going to bust   GREED GREED GREED  I smell economic slow down
212077,danbouck,2008-06-06 23:44:00,4380," I saw that as well. Most of what they were saying was Bull i think. They don't take into consideration the repairs for excessive starting at every light after you shut it off etc.  The guy said ""You can buy a thingy to plug into the thing that the mechanics use to fix cars that tells you your mileage"" I turned it off after that!"
212150,MoriaRiverMan,2008-06-07 01:31:00,314,"Same guy probally smokes ,drinks and eats fast food"
212152,danbouck,2008-06-07 01:33:00,4380, I'm confused!
212154,MoriaRiverMan,2008-06-07 01:36:00,314,"im not suprised you are.  In a simple form.  A guy who is using the lightfoot method to save gas and what ever methods he can come up with is the same guy that is more in likely throwing his money out the window on butts,booze and fast food!  Get the point yet?  Or want it in picture form?"
212159,danbouck,2008-06-07 01:41:00,4380,"  You deserve one of these  So a guy who likes to save money on gas must drink, smoke and eat fast food. That's a new one!  Please in the future if you would like to insult me keep it in PM format."
212160,TJQ,2008-06-07 01:43:00,7806,"http://www.hypermiling.com/  Ill tell ya what though......  usually when I go up to my camp, I'm travelling at 105-115.  It takes me 3/4 of a tank to get there.  the last couple of times, theres been no rush to get there, i set the cruise control at 90 and when I get there Ive use a very little more than half a tank.  I figure if i can keep the lead outta my foot, over the sumer, i will get one if not two extra trips to camp on the same dough...  they are not kidding when they say you can save fuel if ya just slow down a bit.  still stings everytime I fill up the truck..."
212161,MoriaRiverMan,2008-06-07 01:44:00,314,  Dont be so sensitive Danny
212162,danbouck,2008-06-07 01:46:00,4380, In my suburban setting the cruise at 90k makes a huge difference. I can make it to Espanola using a 1/4 tank.  EDIT: Great Link T.J.
212176,brkygetr,2008-06-07 02:00:00,425,here in the Fort its been $1.30 for the past month or so... I came out here last May and paid EXACTLY $1.13 a liter for about 7 months and then in feb things started to creap up...believe me those of you who are still back south got a break for a while. We all are gonna have to pay the price untill that water fueled car becomes a reality...and that IS truely the reality of it Its gonna cost me a lot this fall to hunt!!!! There is a LOT of bush roads out here.
212188,charlied,2008-06-07 02:51:00,584,"I cleaned out my truck today and found a receipt from Feb/08....gas was $ .98.9.....I am not paying as much as you guys up north for fuelbut it was 1.27 today, thats a huge money....cost me almost $20 more to fill...LOL.  Oh well, I started getting out my bike and now bike to places which are only a 5-10 minute drive, it just takes 30 minutes now...LOL.  I just drive my truck when I go to work and thats it now. Maybe I will save enough over the summer to leave town on a recreational tour...LOL.  But I wouldn't trade my truck in for anything!"
212199,Tarzan's Jane,2008-06-07 03:21:00,1183,"I can only speak for myself and maybe a few others...but for sure cutting back and planning for rough roads ahead is definitely a wise way of thinking...""prepare yourself"".  I am the sole controller of my finances...I know everything...and therefore I know where I can squeeze..but honestly...with the price of oil up, everything else is following...just look at food prices...some of the specials you see now...are great...but when they return from special, you can bet the price will have increased....I just know this because of the work I do and that's all that has to be said.  Yep...some pretty good sized bumps coming!!!   Yet one must think even further and  see brighter times too....I am visioning a promotion for myself.....  Sink or Swim...I prefer to Swim."
212204,Carp,2008-06-07 03:31:00,1488,Time to find a job within walking distance from home.
212207,charlied,2008-06-07 03:43:00,584,"LOL nice, walk to work and save all your gas money for fishing trips.  The gas issues are one of the reasons i am getting out of Factory Work and gonna go into  a career that is very stable and does not have Lay- offs like Factories do, and of course pays better, LOL!"
212248,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-06-07 12:15:00,1362,I'm working from home now a lot more than I have been and I can't believe (nor can my manager) how much more productive I am and I'm saving a crap load of money by not using my F-150 traveling to the office and back everyday!!!  Gas prices will affect everything....I just had a tandem load of logs dropped off at the house so I can starting cuttin and splittin firewood for next year  ....price went up from $850 - $900 (21 face cords or 7 bush cords) because of the price of diesel .....but I'm still ahead compared to what the heating oil costs are!!....
212254,Greencoachdog,2008-06-07 12:21:00,8163,Try filling your tank up with WATER!!!  I read in another thread that internal combustion engines run like a Striped   Ape on just plain water!!!

212311,sharper,2008-06-07 17:14:00,279,My car requires premium gas
212315,ccmtcanada,2008-06-07 17:34:00,7971,Hah!!  I live in a great area!!  Gas here didn't got up to 1.36.  Just filled up for a bargain $1.349  
212316,danbouck,2008-06-07 18:16:00,4380,One upside to a 175L gas tank is that I can wait a month if I want to buy more gas!
