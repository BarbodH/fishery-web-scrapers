212645,SBCregal,2008-06-08 17:55:00,688,"hey all  I am looking at picking up a set of polarized sunglasses for on the water and was wondering which lens is better.  Is there a difference between an amber, gray or yellow lens.  I believe the yellow lenses would be good for low light conditions.  I'm unsure of the differences between gray and amber.  thoughts?  ryan"

212653,Joey,2008-06-08 18:20:00,9122,I like the grey or green.  The amber is too bright for me.  I find you can see through the water better with the grey or green also.  Joey

212730,jediangler,2008-06-08 21:42:00,1923,Amber is for overcast or rainy days so you can still see through the water without them being too dark. Grey or green for sunny days.
