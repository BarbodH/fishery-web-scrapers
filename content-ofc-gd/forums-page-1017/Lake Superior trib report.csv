212569,danc,2008-06-08 15:28:00,4677,"I finally found the time to get out for a few hours yesterday. A Lake Superior tributary was my destination, hoping to find a few late season Steelhead. I was actually unsure if I should have even went because of Fridays record rainfall around here. If you watched the Weather Network at all on Friday, then you probably saw one of the many reports about the devastating storm that we experienced. To give you an idea, here's a few photos from the area that I borrowed from a local news website.        My biggest concern was that the water would be chocolate milk. As it turned out, my concern was somewhat justified. The water levels were fine because this particular is controlled by Ontario Power Generation, rather than mother nature. But what is normally a crystal clear river had only about 2 feet of visibility because of runoff.  This is normally a trickle that leads into the river.    Anyways, my step son Pete and I were there and tried to make the best of it. Despite the conditions, it was a rather nice day to be out in the boat anyways.    Fishing was tough. We only managed to catch a few Lake Trout and a surprise Walleye. The Steelhead that we were looking for were nowhere to be found, although we lost several fish that we didn't get a look at. Perhaps we had a Steelhead or two on the line, but who knows. The Lakers were scrappy fish that averaged a few pounds.    One of the Lakers had a Lamprey attached to him. Damn, I hate those things.    Here it appears to be smiling at me. But I got the last laugh.    The highlight of the day was seeing two Moose swimming across the river not too far from the boat. As I motored around a corner in the river, I saw two objects in the water that I knew didn't belong there. At first I thought that it was a couple of logs, as there was lots of debris in the river from the rain. Soon after I realized that it was a couple of one year old twins. It's always nice to see a Moose or two. I was impressed with their power as they swam across the heavy current with ease.      All in all, it was a pretty good day."

212578,Musky or Specks,2008-06-08 15:40:00,2710,Dan C enemy of Lamprey everywhere. Thanks for the report and at least you caught some fishing under tough conditions.
212580,Whopper,2008-06-08 15:45:00,2174,"Good report Dan, glad to see ya get out on the water  Good pics!  Thanks for sharing!"

212595,Greencoachdog,2008-06-08 16:16:00,8163,Great report and pics Dan!!!  The only way I'd wanna hold one of those Lamprey's is with a pair of vise grips and a blow torch!!! Those things are absolutely disgusting!!
212599,scuro,2008-06-08 16:21:00,386,"Nice report, thanks for giving us a taste of fishing a different part of the province."
212600,camillj,2008-06-08 16:22:00,1988,Great pics Dan .. cant wait to see some of those Nipigon Coasters ... boy the markings on the backs of those lakers are just like the big brookies.  Thanks for sharing
212615,douG,2008-06-08 16:38:00,2693,"Dan, thanks a lot for posting those pictures.  That was some serious water you got there, I recall your post announcing 8 cm of rain, that's gotta be plenty.  Lampreys make me think of that Star Trek episode with the planet eater.  I hate em.  "
212627,misfish,2008-06-08 17:20:00,29133,"Very nice pic,s Dan. TFS Bud."
212633,b2kptbo,2008-06-08 17:34:00,1505,"Cool report, thanks..."
212636,Joey,2008-06-08 17:43:00,9122,What fantastic photo's of the moose Dan.  Even if I didn't catch any fish that would have made my day  Those local station pics sure tell a story.  Just shows you how strong mum nature can be when she wants too.  Great report.  Joey
212637,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-06-08 17:43:00,0,Sounds like another great adventure in the Great North! Thanks for sharing.
212647,Moosebunk,2008-06-08 18:02:00,3970,"Ughh!!! ""Sick"" and sick lamprey shot Dan.  Catchin' anything in that kind of flood would be a tough task.  Ya did alright dood.  Thanks for the report, and careful on those roads. lol."
212705,tbayboy,2008-06-08 20:27:00,1497,"Cool stuff Dan.  I was suppose to fish the Kam (River near Dan's area for those of you knot familiar) Saturday but we bailed when we saw the huge current and the massive amount of trees and shrubbery being dragged along in the current.  Gonna give a different rivera a shot tonight before I fly back tommorrow, fingers crosed."
212847,danc,2008-06-09 01:07:00,4677,Thanks for the replies people. Sean. I had a look at the Kam on Friday night. What a mess. I wonder how the fish can survive in that mud. The rain was much needed though. Lake Superior is down about 8 inches last I heard. This will help.
212975,rickster,2008-06-09 12:25:00,495,Great report Dan good to see some young moose around. Water is high here too Rainy River is up about 6-7feet right now Makes for a little tougher fishing but great for cruising..don't have to worry about any rocks just the odd log floating downstream
212980,ccmtcanada,2008-06-09 12:28:00,7971,"Dan...what a great report!  That's some serious flooding in those first pics.  The conditions were tough and you didn't get into the bows, but you sure know how to boat fish!"
212998,Victor,2008-06-09 12:50:00,1609,Some good pictures! Haven't seen a closeup of a lamprey like that. Thanks for sharing!
213137,solopaddler,2008-06-09 18:30:00,8605,Beautiful scenery and some nice fish! You sure do live in a great part of the province..
213169,Spiel,2008-06-09 19:39:00,9065,....Now that is some serious water! Anyone try to cross?  Oh and good job on the fish.
