213086,theRJ,2008-06-09 16:48:00,55,"I was fishing on Sunday morning when i realized that something was missing from my reel. Apparently at some point I lost the cast control cap (the little screw on cap beside the handle) It does not seem to have any really negative affect on my casting but I definately want to replace it. I have a Quantum Energy PT X-Metal (model E861XM I believe) Where might I find a replacement cap, I tried quantum's part website but couldn't find my reel in their lists, and what it might cost me?  Thanks RJ"
