212387,brickNblock,2008-06-07 23:47:00,598,"Newangler, you've had a lot of greeat suggestions Bud. John said........ Get a hold of buddy who sold you the boat and get him to show you if theres a lil trick to starting it...generally is on older motors. and, Brian (misfish)...those older motors dont all have the kill switch and are difficult to get parts for""... If thats the case you really need to get a motor a little newer for sure. I just got rid of the motor off my tinny...it was an 18hp ev and talk about something that would turn you off fishing all together....a real pain to get started.......WELL< I love fishing...so i got myself a newer motor. JMO"
212398,glen,2008-06-08 00:44:00,2641,Did you get it running?  If not try this.  Put motor in neural put throttle all the way forward open vent on top of gas cap prime bulb until hard turn key motor starts catch big fish post on OFC
212411,idesign,2008-06-08 01:19:00,149,  thx buddy. the vent on top of cap is fixed.I asked my bro to try to open it but it doesn't.Also tried pliers&wrench to open it but it looks like it is fixed to cap.pls let me know.thx
212414,glen,2008-06-08 01:37:00,2641,I had a tank the same as that one.  There is no vent screw on the top so just turn the gas cap back 1/4 turn.  This will let the air in the top of the tank.
212415,idesign,2008-06-08 01:40:00,149, k i will try that and will let you know tomorrow the results.thx for reply  is there any way to test the motor without taking to lake.let me know.thx
212416,danbouck,2008-06-08 01:43:00,4380, get some muffs and turn on the water or put it in a barrel  
212418,ccmtcanada,2008-06-08 01:44:00,7971, Fill a big garbage can with water and put the lower end in it.  Just be sure to make sure the water level goes higher than the water intake or you could ruin the lower end quickly.  Make sure the motor is peeing when it starts.
212598,idesign,2008-06-08 16:21:00,149,Thank you very much for all suggestion members gave me.I appreciated very much.My outboard finally started today and it is running great.Yesterday we didn't chocked the engine so it was not starting.Today my bro some how figure out how to chock and in first try the outboard started.I am very happy today.Once again thx to all who replied    
212606,oxcowboy,2008-06-08 16:28:00,544,"GREAT,  glad ya gotter going,  hope ya catch lots fish.  jason"
212607,misfish,2008-06-08 16:29:00,29133,"Thats great news. Enjoy.  I am surprised that the screw thats in the pic,on the cap,does not turn."
212614,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-06-08 16:37:00,0,I love happy endings and OFC is certainly a great community!!!!
212646,idesign,2008-06-08 18:01:00,149, Yep .It is thx guys
212659,danbouck,2008-06-08 18:46:00,4380,Great!  Now go Fishing
212268,idesign,2008-06-07 13:57:00,149,today morning i went to Bluffers Park to test drive my new boat.i changed the fuel.changed gear oil.every thing set. fuel is also coming.outboard was tuned up last year before winter. but when i try to start the engine it cranks but not starting.any know what could be the problem.let me know.thx thx   it is Johnson 28hp outboard.
212269,danbouck,2008-06-07 14:02:00,4380,carb could be gunked up. Did you use a fuel stabilizer before winter?
212270,ccmtcanada,2008-06-07 14:03:00,7971,"I've had some starting issues as well....  Check the spark plugs and wires.  Make sure there's a good connection there.  Check the plugs as well...they may need changed.....and also check the gap measurement...even if they are new.  Your manual for the motor will tell you what that gap should be.  Is this new gas or is it from last year?  If last year, did you use fuel stabilizer?  Explain what you did before you tried to start it....did you use the choke?  Did the motor start and then sputter right out?"
212273,perodimi,2008-06-07 14:08:00,124,"I always check the obvious. Did you prime the bulb? Even then, I find if you over prime, you can flood the engine. If you smell gas, try starting with the choke off and the throttle wide open until it catches. The next obvious one is the kill switch. Most have a lanyard attached that many of us don't use so make sure the switch is on. Lastly, some engines have a fuel shutoff valve so obviously that too should be on unless you have it connected to an onboard tank. Memart and I found that out the hard way. His kicker runs off his main tank with the engine fuel valve in the off position as it bypasses the built in tank, go figure.  Cheers,  Peter"
212275,idesign,2008-06-07 14:11:00,149," hey buddy thx for quick reply.  i just put new gas this morning and added oil.this is all i did.the guy i bought boat said outboard was tuned up last year before winter.i can see fresh grease every where.i checked spark plug also it  looks brand new. when i try to start it just cranks and not start.no sputter or anything.it looks like motor is trying to start but last moment it doesn't. the guy i bought boat said just put new gas and it will start for sure.so should i take to marina or try to change spark plug again .let me know.thx  also can u tell me what this mean ""gap measurement"" .i am not sure what ur talking about.i also dont have manual for outboard.thx"
212276,jwl,2008-06-07 14:14:00,1056,"is it a pull start or key start?????   if a key start you say it cranks but won't fire...is the kill switch on or off???..easy to mix up, had that prob before..my kids when younger would goof around in the boat alot fishing from theboat cuz of course that was way cooler than fishing from the dock..and sometimes when goofing around they would hit the kill switch...then I told them they couldn't fish or sit in the driver's seat any more..lol  also did ya choke it/or use the ""cold start lever""???or could be your battery not cranking out enough starting power  could be the plugs as well..take one out, have a look, had probs starting my 9.9 first 2 trips out this season, would take 8-9 pulls to fire up, then would run like a champ..last trip i cahnged the plugs and she fires first pull every time now."
212277,danbouck,2008-06-07 14:15:00,4380,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spark_plug  Did you SEE it run when you bought it? If not you should probably take it to a shop IMO
212282,MoriaRiverMan,2008-06-07 14:22:00,314,Quck thought.....  Check kill switch  Been there before
212285,oxcowboy,2008-06-07 14:48:00,544,is the vent to the gas tank open?  just a thought been there before.  jason
212286,MoriaRiverMan,2008-06-07 14:53:00,314,  Dans got the right idea..  
212301,idesign,2008-06-07 15:59:00,149,sorry looks dumb but i am not sure where the kill switch is.i have attached pic.Can some1 check and tell me if everything looks ok.  forgot to mention.i also put brand new battery .         
212302,Cookslav,2008-06-07 16:23:00,1457,"Check your control cables to, and ensure they are pushing the gas as it should. If he tuned the engine he may have been manualy pushing the throttle, and choke whil testing it. Easy to check... Just pop the lid, and watch to see if the controls move as you push. If it appears to be lacking motion get a freind to turn the key and manualy push the throttle in bursts to get it started, pleeeeeze ensure you keep your fingers away from the engine If it still doesn't start try over pumping your gas a bit to ensure you have gas flow...check to see if your flooding, leaking etc.... If thats working fine I suggest you clean the carb, if it still don't start change the plugs. and then....take her back, or to a mechanic. Could be your starter?"
212303,BFSC Kevin,2008-06-07 16:27:00,1351,the kill switch should be at the controls. did the guy not give you the lanyard?
212304,idesign,2008-06-07 16:32:00,149, all i got was key and boat off course. i can return it.i bought from my co worker.i got every thing for $580.  if it not start i will take to mechanic.if too expensive to repair i will give it back. let me know what to do.thx  Is there any from Scarborough can help me out.I can meet you at Bluffers Park tomorrow morning.let me know
212305,Zamboni,2008-06-07 16:43:00,235,"Basically you need fuel+spark+compression to run. Lets assume comp is ok for now-can you check if plugs are wet (fuel) and you have spark?  If no spark look for simple things first, kill switch....is shifter in neutral etc. Move blk shifter and see if it clicks into neutral, eliminate the simple things.  Where are you?"
212306,idesign,2008-06-07 16:47:00,149, i live on Brimley & Lawrence thx
212307,JohnF,2008-06-07 17:07:00,3494, Why not get your co-worker to show you how he starts it. Maybe you're just missing something in the operation or maybe he knows some little trick that makes it work.  JF
212308,misfish,2008-06-07 17:07:00,29133,"I may be wrong,but I dought theres a kill switch for that older model?????????????? Looking at that tank,the air bleeder is closed. Thats the little turn knob on top of the cap. It,s got to be turned full open.  Not to be rude or negative,but I would try to get something that is in the late 80,s or more current. These older motors can be a real hassel and hard to find parts for. JMO"
212312,idesign,2008-06-07 17:14:00,149, thx i will try that. when i pump the gas it leaks little bit by the pipe connecting to outboard.do u think this is problem.actually i had to go work today so hopefully tomorrow morning i will try out all suggestion i got from members.i will let you know what happens.  i still cannot figure out where the kill switch would be.thx  any more suggestion is welcome
212313,oxcowboy,2008-06-07 17:23:00,544,"check the vent, looks closed.  jason"
212314,idesign,2008-06-07 17:30:00,149, thx.i will try that. also i put brand new battery.does is need charger or when you run outboard it charges by itself.let me know.thx
212318,forrest,2008-06-07 18:23:00,1032,  Check with the store you bought the battery from.  Almost always they are on the shelf charged and ready to go. You will still need a charger over the winter months...a trickle charger will keep the battery fresh.  forrest
212319,danbouck,2008-06-07 18:23:00,4380,The battery should charge while the motor is running. If the motor was cranking than it is not a battery issue.
212370,danc,2008-06-07 22:31:00,4677,"Pull a plug, ground it to the block and see if you have spark. That's the first thing I'd do."
212373,gaspumper,2008-06-07 23:01:00,393,"Is your fuel line running the right way?Check the arrow at the primer bulb the arrow should be pointing towards the motor. I dont think you have to worry about a kill switch on that old a motor,I have a 25hp like that one and it has no kill switch."
