Monday. Because of the size/length of the shipment it had to be sent via air but I am still surprised how quickly it got here. I split the order up and sent all the other items via regular means. I saved about $25, but now I'm thinking I should have just bit the bullet. I guess I'll see how much longer it takes for the rest of the order (usually 7 days)  It's Christmas in June!"

213220,glen,2008-06-09 21:14:00,2641,We aint going to wait that long.
