212971,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-06-09 12:20:00,0," For real! There is obviously Interest in hockey, judging by the amount of views. If people don't like the NF posts? Don't read them. And reply to the fishing posts, so they get pushed to the front of the page. Seems like the NF posts are very active and are staying on the front page so there is obviously interest in them.  Just because Stoty lives and breathes hockey, doesn't mean that he hasn't contributed to fishing topics.  Hockey is over......so may the Soccer posts begin! Italy is playing the netherlands today!"
212976,Stoty,2008-06-09 12:26:00,2910," THANK YOU! I dont recall seeing any reports from a few of ""those"" people recently...  Exactly!"
213021,Spiel,2008-06-09 13:44:00,9065,....Back to the fishing folks....
211561,MoriaRiverMan,2008-06-06 00:57:00,314,Just asked a simple question......  Then the loud mouths crawled out from there holes as normal.......  Could have just gave a reasonable answer...........but no.......  Questions are just loud mouths bait !!!!!!!
211574,paulyboy83,2008-06-06 01:30:00,54,"It would be a crime to not have the HNIC theme anymore.  I don't even really watch it because it's usually the leafs playing, but the song is a Canadian icon.  My wife even let me have it played as we entered the hall at our wedding reception!  PB"
211641,holdfast,2008-06-06 04:39:00,1813,NICE   thats awesome
211649,JohnF,2008-06-06 05:13:00,3494, SSSHHHHHHHH!!!!!! The composer will want her 500 bux.  JF
211651,Guest skeeter99,2008-06-06 06:52:00,0,"it's about time they got rid of it   time for the changing of the guard   come on guys be honest, you really cant say u like that after all these years   It just reminds me of don cherry and all his crap!!!!  the hockey mouthpiece of north america"
211668,Chris,2008-06-06 10:48:00,405,Cherry says it like it is.....not like the politically correct Bull we have been force-fed from the bleeding heart types. I have more respect for Don than all of our political leaders combined.  
211701,Stoty,2008-06-06 12:09:00,2910,"  Where you dropped on your head as a child? Cause that is crazy talk! That song is lengendary. Don Cherry, even though he is sickening sometimes, doesnt sugarcoat anything and speaks whatever is on his mind. I guess lots of people just dont like hearing the truth.  And yes, MOST true canadians LOVE that song even after all these years."
211728,holdfast,2008-06-06 13:05:00,1813,"I agree 100 percent. The Song, Cherry, TRUE CANADIAN Themes"
211733,Moosebunk,2008-06-06 13:11:00,3970,"Don't mind a little hockey threadage.  Some guys around here don't seem to really fish though, all they do is talk hockey.  Maybe now that it's summer we'll see some fishing reports and threads from them......"
211738,capt bruce,2008-06-06 13:18:00,820,"Leave the song alone , Like Stoty said its only 500 bucks a pop , chump change to the leafs organization (NHL )and the tax grabbing CBC. Cherry , the song , the maple leafs ,and yes MORIA guy FISHING good or bad (or in the case of the leafs sad so so sad ) ITS CANADA , ask anyone in CANADA to regonize any one and you will get a correct answer , CANADIAN INSTITUTIONS ."

212081,MoriaRiverMan,2008-06-06 23:47:00,314,  That would be the big mouth no it all's!!!  They know who they are!!!  Probally sorten there hockey cards right now!
212101,danbouck,2008-06-07 00:27:00,4380,"I think it's time for this thread to go back to the original topic before it gets locked. Some of the ""KNOW it all's"" wanted to discuss the hockey theme."
212108,MoriaRiverMan,2008-06-07 00:39:00,314,But getting locked gets it off the main page and allows for the fishing info
212114,danbouck,2008-06-07 00:44:00,4380, I guess you just don't get what this community is all about!  http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=20294
212119,MoriaRiverMan,2008-06-07 00:50:00,314,It more appears were divided into two groups !!!  Real men that fish and others that post drama  Im more pulling the hockey guys chains than anything  but it is a pain when watching a fishing thread and have to dig and scroll to find it hidden in the NF threads.  either way..........its nice to see the leafs win the cup  LOL
212143,maybe,2008-06-07 01:16:00,307,"It's toast.  I don't understand how changing a jingle is a life-altering crisis, but nobody seems to give a darn about the guy destroying a huge chunk of BOQ shoreline and dumping PCBs on the walleye."
212147,MoriaRiverMan,2008-06-07 01:26:00,314,"  Now there's a topic worth talking about and educating people about.  but goodluck..........   the dan to don bla be bal hockey tune at the start, end or where ever it is in a hockey game is a big deal"
212172,maybe,2008-06-07 01:57:00,307,"Well, I did try.  One reply, and it dropped off the front page."
212295,lazybum,2008-06-07 15:34:00,142," Yeah, what nerve they have trying to rip off the good ole CBC which is partially funded by you and me . Why should the CBC pay that ransom? And the music owner knows that all the bleeding hearts don't care if the CBC has to pay so long as it doesn't come out of their pocket directly.  The solution is for all the bleeding hearts to chip in $20 bucks each in a pool and buy the music outright and then donate it to the CBC. 100,000 people x $20 = $2 million.  Not enough? then get 200,000 people to chip in.  As the saying goes.. put your money where your mouth is.  I'm offering a different point of view to balance things out on this one-sided discussion   ."
212327,highdrifter,2008-06-07 19:11:00,2534," Stoty... you're freaking possessed man!!  Ever consider joining a hockey board?  Seriously, other threads are getting pushed back before we can read em cause you're using the board as a chat room.  It's a bit much.  Fire away..  HD"
212346,JohnF,2008-06-07 20:49:00,3494, It's okay. Bass season is almost upon us. Hockey will soon be just a distant memory.  JF
212922,holdfast,2008-06-09 05:10:00,1813,"But wait, the Leafs got a new coach"
212956,scuro,2008-06-09 11:40:00,386," Come now, Cherry as a demigod? I see those outfits he wears and think all he needs is the orange wig, red lipstick and red nose and the transformation would be complete. Bozo the angry clown.  Besides if he was perfect what is he doing working for the nationalized communist CBC?"
212966,Stoty,2008-06-09 12:08:00,2910,Its funny that the people who cant stand hockey posts.....are replying to them! Kinda like peeing into the wind now isnt it.....doesnt make much sense!

211332,wallyboss,2008-06-05 16:57:00,1095, It did say  NF on the post ?? just don't read theones that say NF and you will never be offended!!!
211352,ccmtcanada,2008-06-05 17:22:00,7971,Getting rid of that HNIC theme is like changing the tune to Oh Canada for me.  I think there will be a revolt out in hockeyland if this happens.  Oh wait...if we change the tune of Oh Canada to the HNIC theme...hmm....
211371,workwear,2008-06-05 18:02:00,592,i wouldnt worry bout our national anthem...(hnic theme song )...goin anywhere soon...this is just a tactic for negotiations i think....i grew up with that song...and every saturday night before the game starts i sing a few bars to my son and he knows its time to watch the best ever game in the world.....i wouldnt worry guys...ill bet itll be back next year  if not..cbc should lose the rights to broadcast any hockey game!!!!
211373,ketchenany,2008-06-05 18:05:00,3229,"Hey CCMT revamp the OFC Anthem and put in a bit of Hockey and submit it to the CBC for $50 a pop, it's worth try!"
211381,1leggedangler,2008-06-05 18:28:00,364,"Give the man his $500.00 a game and move on with it! Would never be same without it, usually the best part of the games especially for us leaf fans."
211382,Stoty,2008-06-05 18:30:00,2910,I totally agree!
211384,Stoty,2008-06-05 18:32:00,2910,"Or....since the leafs make $1.9 million PER GAME just on ticket sales alone..... get them to fork over the $40,000 to give to the guy!  $40,000 - thats only about 10 tickets to 1 game. LOL"
211460,MoriaRiverMan,2008-06-05 21:56:00,314, Not offended at all....... Just these threads push the other Fishing related threads your watching down and make harder to find thats all.  Be a good idea for this board just to make a NF section.  Be a win win situation wouldnt it
211531,danbouck,2008-06-05 23:41:00,4380,mmm... beer and pepsi   Scroll bar is on the right side! ---------------------------------->>>>>>>>>  took me a while too but I finally figured out how to skip threads
211533,holdfast,2008-06-05 23:45:00,1813," Why dont you join the saskatchewan fishing forum then.  Totally Boring.  Now to answer your Question, NO.  As far as not playing the hockey night in Canada theme that is Iconic to us Canadians.  Why not , take away hitting, fighting, christmas trees, next will be Bacon and Eggs.  But hey, lets keep Coranation Street."
211541,camillj,2008-06-06 00:05:00,1988, And yet .. despite the NF in the title you're in the thread not only reading but WHINING (er posting)
