I normally take them up to pigeon lake, where we have non-shop pan fish action.  Was Possibly looking to go to Lake Scugog, however had not had much luck in Port Perry.  Can anyone provide me with any suggestions.  I'm located by Pickering, anything within 30-45 minutes would be great.  My little 4 year old is extremely impatient.  OH, forgot to mention, there will be no boat involved.  Thanks for the assistance."
