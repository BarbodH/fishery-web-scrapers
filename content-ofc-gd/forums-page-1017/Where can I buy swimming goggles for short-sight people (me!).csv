212873,Flyboy,2008-06-09 02:11:00,26,"I shared your misery in finding a working pair of goggles that nobody seems to carry - not even in large sporting goods stores. Give the store (listed below) a try. You can get individually different prescription (>7.0+) 'eyecup' for each eye. The 'eyecups' are assembled into a slick racing swim goggles with a strap/bridge kit which you have to buy separately. The cost is around $50 for the whole ordeal. I have a pair and am quite happy with them. The only shortcoming is you'll have to wear the Fishman goggles to see while lounging by the poolside unless you have your glasses handy .
