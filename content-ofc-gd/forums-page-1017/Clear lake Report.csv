213064,mike hagan,2008-06-09 16:05:00,50,"The bite was on ,thanks to Lew on Kawartha launch. Started out  heading south down the west shoreline from launch at 5.30 and tied on small shad perch ,slow trolling in 10,20 fow. 2 Minutes in hook into first eye.not big but good start.Turned around and trolled again and right in same spot caught another eye . 2.35 lbs. Down goes the electric and start casting big for about 1/2 hr nothing. Start trolling again .Just past the second point another eye.Stop and start jigging ,hook another eye , still not big 1.75 lbs . Looks like another good spot for Skis,start casting big again Giant perch raps 8 "" and Black/red musky killers. Good drop off Gravel beds,cabbage patch ect. 6 Fow dropping down to 20 fow ,again no luck. Quick jot down to Young's point and first bay on west shore out of channel Nice looking bay with rock shoals and cabbage bed 6-10 fow start casting 6 "" rap ripping threw the weeds and hook into a Oss Sm. Changed up to muskie killer and moved out too 10 FOW and caught another Sm. Moved out of area but Nice to know for season opener. Headed up to the east shore and started trolling the big bend ,marked a lot of bait but did not hook any , tried casting the wind shore line again nothing, headed to some sheltered back islands just north of the bend .Started casting big bucktails , into shallow 6-4 fow stups and logs 2 more Oss lgm. Moved out of area. Question to all when you are in a area fishing for Skis and you catch bass do you stay and keep trying or do you move out . Me personally move out of the area even though it looks promising for Skis. Headed further in to east shore on the other side of the islands .and started trolling with a chartreuse spinner bait with 6-8 fow heavy weeded area, and caught 3 jumbo perch ,10 inches and fat. Threw in big single bladed willow spinner ,only thing to get threw the weeds and nothing. Went back to the big bend on the east shore and started trolling 8 "" deep diving stick bait. in 15-20 fow where I was marking fish just off the windswept shore. Again 2 Oss sm. Didn't want to catch any more bass, getting late in the morning so on came the big deep diving 10"" perch rap and started trolling up to the Stoney Lake markers in 20-30 FOW ,nothing happening , turned around and started trolling back to the marina through the islands mid channel and just as I past the last island to the marina finally hooked into a small but good fighting Ski . 32 "" but chunky .weighing in at 8.12 lbs. days done 12.30 pm got to go. All in all a really good day fishing for never fishing the lake before. Water temps 67 deg. trolling speed walley 1.8-2.0 mph musky speed 3.0 mph. TMI but hope this helps some next time out. Will post pics. when I figure out how to post ."
