212757,Smokey,2008-06-08 22:43:00,1278,Yeah I hope everyone is safe there have all ready been reports of funnel clouds spotted in the London area.  Be safe everyone and watch the news for updates
212767,kickingfrog,2008-06-08 23:03:00,8333,Things are just starting to look ominous here in Barrie. Now where's my kite?
212781,dsn,2008-06-08 23:16:00,1018,This just happened about 15mins ago the thick dark blue clouds move across steeles east ward not down towards the GTA. Only the rain headed downthat way cause it was such a wide band of heavy rain.    This is taken from the West of the GTA out from my window. But its all clear sailing now.    dsn
212784,JohnF,2008-06-08 23:20:00,3494, Don't put on the sunscreen just yet. It's very dark here in Stratford. The rain's a-fallin' and the thunder's a-rumblin'. You should get it in a bit.  JF
212787,Joey,2008-06-08 23:23:00,9122,"Yes, the second band is coming through soon, and should be worse than the first.  I'm hoping I can get my bar-b-quing doing in between.  Time to go flip  Joey"
212791,danbouck,2008-06-08 23:27:00,4380,First Batch wasn't bad but it is black and thundering here! Should be a good show. At least the pool will fill up faster!  EDIT: Pouring now!
212793,kickingfrog,2008-06-08 23:28:00,8333,"I love watching big systems role through, as long as I'm safe in my house. On an island, surrounded by big white pines and water with only a tent... very scary."
212796,danbouck,2008-06-08 23:32:00,4380,
212807,dsn,2008-06-08 23:47:00,1018,I can see the second band moving in from a distance getting dark blue. Looks like there is third band too later on in the evening. 
212810,danbouck,2008-06-08 23:50:00,4380,I guess they are telling people in Brantford to go to their basements.  Can anyone confirm this?
212812,fatherof3,2008-06-08 23:57:00,1769,"it is pretty nasty in Paris/Brantford.It comes down very hard then stops with lots of lightning.As far as the basements,yes people are being warned.Very windy here for a bit."
212821,Gerritt,2008-06-09 00:14:00,6129,I have never seen winds like this before! insanity! the wind driven rain actually hurts!..  I think it is best to avoid any of the windows in the house.  G
212824,Mike Pike,2008-06-09 00:16:00,1332,"Wow, central Hamilton is getting rocked right now!  The high winds are just a shakin' the big ol' maple trees in the hood and my street is running like a river.  Wow, all this in a matter of minutes.  Sheesh!  Nature.. go figure."
212836,MoriaRiverMan,2008-06-09 00:38:00,314,Nice and hot here still and no rain or wind yet
212840,JohnF,2008-06-09 00:44:00,3494,Interesting. Here in Stratford it got dark and rained a bit with some thunder. The ground is already drying and the sky is clearing.  JF
212842,Gerritt,2008-06-09 00:49:00,6129,"John & MRM, I do not recall seeing a storm like the one we just experienced in a very long time.. I was about ready to send the family to the basement... Alot of large old tree in VERY close proximity to my roof top...  And they are saying there is more to come.... Great..  G"
212843,MoriaRiverMan,2008-06-09 00:51:00,314,hmmmm Hope it misses me............have huge tree's all around my house......  And spent whole weekend fixing the last of the flood damage!!  Dont need a tree on house!
212844,fatherof3,2008-06-09 00:53:00,1769,quiet here now but heard there is still more coming.
212853,danbouck,2008-06-09 01:10:00,4380,Just took a drive to Paris. Cleared up now but I could see a lot of clouds coming from the west.
