212333,Greencoachdog,2008-06-07 19:24:00,8163,"Disassembly, cleaning and lubricating will fix your problem."
212479,jace,2008-06-08 07:12:00,472,"  also the possibility of a bent or seriously part somewhere, a ripped torn or worn drag disc..    Rear drags are not the best or smoothest design anyways which is why they all but abandoned that idea a few years after trying it out.  the top dollar reels have never had rear drag for this reason..the best place for a spool's drag is right on the spool, go figure."
212481,BabyHerc,2008-06-08 07:36:00,285,"I'll agree, almost all rear drags will stick or slip a bit.  Regardless, do what Greencoachdog said.  Get a small screwdriver, some degreaser and some reel grease.  Disassmble the reel and clean your innards, then reapply grease according to manufacturer instructions."
212910,POLLIWOGG,2008-06-09 04:23:00,835,"Thanks guys , Ive cleaned it and light oiled it before , maybe grease is the answer."
212947,Greencoachdog,2008-06-09 11:25:00,8163, Grease everything on a spinning reel! Save the oil for the baitcasters.
212954,Musky or Specks,2008-06-09 11:37:00,2710,Im going to guess a bad drag washer. Burned out because you used the reel for salmon or steelhead fishing. Probably needs some new parts. Rear drag reels cant take the punishment of those long runs.
213072,BabyHerc,2008-06-09 16:18:00,285," Good point, but a bad washer would give the reel no drag, would it not?"
