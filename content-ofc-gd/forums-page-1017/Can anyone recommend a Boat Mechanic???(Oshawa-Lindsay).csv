So I called my mechanic and only found out that he’s retired.  Can anyone recommend  a reliable/ reasonable tech in Oshawa, or Lindsay area that I can take my boat to?  What a bummer on the Musky openr   ….  Thanks folks."

He's always done a great job, and gets it done fast.  I've tried numerous places from durham to Lindsay, and they are the only ones who keep me coming back. A family run operation, thats been going for a long, long time.  Just google them for the number.  Sinker"
