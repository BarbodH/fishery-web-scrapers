213030,John,2008-06-09 14:35:00,2956,Great start to the season Lew. See you at Lakair.
213031,LeXXington,2008-06-09 14:40:00,1928,Excellent report. Nice too see you got one early in the season great way too start.
213049,Greencoachdog,2008-06-09 15:31:00,8163,"  I said that because I too have been accused of having ""trained pet"" fish, trained to bite only my lures and pets because I don't hurt them and always put them right back.  It almost is like they're your trained pets when you've been fishin' a certain spot for years and you know what and when they're gonna bite... but it doesn't work nearly as well if you always keep what you catch."
213053,fishnsled,2008-06-09 15:39:00,3520,"Great start to the season Lew, thanks for the report."
213138,solopaddler,2008-06-09 18:32:00,8605,"Nice read Lew, thanks."
212701,lew,2008-06-08 20:16:00,12767,"Muskies often become very active  in that transition period as the sun breaks the horizon in the morning and again as it sets below the horizon in the evening, so yesterday morning I wanted to be casting to a favorite spot at the precise moment the sun rose.  The wind was blowing fairly strong from the s/w so I positioned the boat downwind and let it push me to the ""spot on spot"" I've often had luck with very early in the morning. This particular place is no bigger than a house yet it has 2 small points that very often hold a fish.  The sun was  about 1/2 exposed above the horizon and I'd only made about 10 casts as I tossed a black / chartreuse bucktail at the target and sure enuff when I got to that magic spot, there was a nice boil as the bait hit the water and then that beautiful solid hit I've been waiting for since last December.  It wasn't a big fish, maybe 40-42"" but it was a nice way to start off the 2008 season and get my new Calcutta 400TE slimed and ready for another year on the water. I don't take many fish pics anymore and seldom even measure them now, so as soon as she was un-clipped she was off to swim another day.  I moved on to another favorite spot and had a follow from a mid 40's but she wouldn't commit and then I had another fish take a swipe at a figure 8 but missed it.  Muskies can be very predictable critters and it's nice when a plan is formulated and a fish is caught within 10 minutes and exactly when & where you thought it would happen. Sorta makes it all worthwhile when a plan comes together.  We had friends coming to the trailer at noon yesterday so I spent the day with them and this morning I had some firewood to stack so I never got on the water again, but the season has started off well and that's all any of us can ask for.  Hopefully everyone else enjoyed the musky opener as much as I did, it was a long time coming."
212706,misfish,2008-06-08 20:30:00,29133,"Hey Lew great report.

212879,Greencoachdog,2008-06-09 02:19:00,8163,"I think it'd be pretty safe to say that the fish that made it into the inside of the boat was one of Lews ""trained pet"" fish, prolly got released with a mouthfull of smoked Anchovy treats!  Good on ya for gettin' out and makin' sure they were ok Lew!!!"
