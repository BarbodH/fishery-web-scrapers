212746,GNODDY,2008-06-08 22:36:00,163,Had a charter booked with U&Me Guide Service on June 21st and I cannot do it now. I have put down 175 for deposit so the remaining is 400. Split between 4 people is 100 bucks each. Let me know if anyone wants to take this over as I won't get my deposit back.  Cheers   Geoff
