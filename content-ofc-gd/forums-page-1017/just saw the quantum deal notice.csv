I saw the first ad about a week ago, the Energy PT and Tour edn PT baitcasters for $100 and $120 respectively which is roughly 1/2 the normal price.   This would make 4 or 5 retailers with the same price reductions.  Quantum must be getting ready to roll all new lineup for the summer and don't want their distributors to get stuck with a truck full of older models.  It's definitely a good deal for those who like quantum unfortunately, that doesn't include me.  Maybe i'll like their new stuff."
