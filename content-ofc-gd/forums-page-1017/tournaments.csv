The North Bay Bassmasters has club tournies throughout the summer, and members enter as boaters and non boaters and everybody pays $25 to fish with the money split up to the winners. It's a draw format so you fish with a different partner at each event. The Temiscaming smallmouth anglers have a tournament series also that has events on Trout Lake and Nipissing as well as a bunch of other lakes."
