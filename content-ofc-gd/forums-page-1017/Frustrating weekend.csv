NORMALLY THEY WOULD REDUCE IT, The Cop HAs to do his job, but he is not there to rip people off, chances are he will not show up.  If the cop is not there, you are off the hook.  I had a $45 ticket once for not having enough padel, decide to fight it and when the time comes and I reach the Arbitration, he was confuse why a padel and I said it was for a boat, he asked me how much I want it reduce. I was kind of Dumbfounded, and said $25, he said go pay for it at the cashier."
