Head west until you hit Belle River Rd. and turn right this will get you right into Belle River. Hope this helps some one out if you know of someone coming down this way please let them know.

212145,taper,2008-06-07 01:20:00,611,Mike if we go the way you described can we turn left and cross the 401 on the Belle river road to head to Colchester or do we need to get South of the 401 at Tilbury.
212180,Handlebarz,2008-06-07 02:08:00,3790,Yes you can still cross under the 401 that is not shut down from what we saw but I think it might be later when they start to rip out the over pass mid june. Will try and remember to update this for people heading this way
