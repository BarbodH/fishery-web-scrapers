211886,bassfighter,2008-06-06 16:28:00,366,"I am just wondering what is the surface water temp at any Kawarthas lake. Any lake such as Rice lake, Balsam, Stoney, Bukhorn, etc...... will be fine.  I can assume they are almost the same temp at this time of the year.  Has it gone up past 60 degrees  Thanks for any feedback"
211889,Stoty,2008-06-06 16:45:00,2910,"yes, its over 60 in Stoney. Should be about 63-65 now."

212672,bassfighter,2008-06-08 19:24:00,366,"Thanks for the report.  Water sure warming up fast, the weeds will be growing up soon and better fishing is yet to come.  Anyone tried swimming on the water yet? With the heat we are getting in couple of days, who has tried so far?  We are planning to head out tomorrow monday and wind forecast will be calm and temp a little bit cooler.  We will cross our finger and hope the fish gets more active then."
212955,Jer,2008-06-09 11:39:00,1426,"The kids were swimming on Buckhorn all day yesterday (including a 1 1/2 and a 2 1/2 year old). Water temp at my dock was 72 in the morning, 78 by late afternoon.  I'm on a fairly shallow bay, 5' to 6', and have noticed the surface temp can vary hugely day to day depending on the weather and is rarely as cool as the main lake."
212981,ccmtcanada,2008-06-09 12:29:00,7971,Sturgeon yesterday afternoon was around 72F in about 6 to 8 ft of water.....around 68 in deeper sections.
