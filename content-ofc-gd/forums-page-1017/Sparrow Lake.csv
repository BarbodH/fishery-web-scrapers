It was a pretty tough bite I thought, only landed 9 fish and lost a few, one giant, but thats fishing. Congrats on the 5th place, come out again next year, its a good event, and weights are usually a bit better than what they were this year.  Last year we had 12 something and came 9th."

212668,misfish,2008-06-08 19:16:00,29133,It was just to show board members Steve.LOL
212695,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-06-08 20:10:00,0,Congrats on the great finish!!! But you guys must be fishing the wrong side of the lake!!! I always fish the same side of Sparrow. The south east and the fishing was spotty with hardly no weeds. Never catch numbers but catch pike averaging in the 7-9lb range!!! Last year had nothing but Musky follows in the area at pike opener!  The north end produces the hammer handles and I am now exploring the west end. Maybe next year I will join the tournament!
