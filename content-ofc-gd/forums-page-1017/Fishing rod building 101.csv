213003,kickingfrog,2008-06-09 12:57:00,8333,"So I've thought about building my own fishing rod for a while. Recently I needed to replace the tip top on a muskie stick and because of its size and my distance from a quality tackle store that carried the proper size, I decided to get a whole rod kit shipped as well as a guide replacement for the muskie rod.  The rod is a one piece spinning outfit with a fast tip and medium power. I ordered it (on the internet) on Friday and will post when it comes in. I really should have started this in the winter but at least the basement is really cool in the summer.  I've never done this before and I've already received much useful advice from some of the members here who have done this before. Thanks guys.  I plan to post the steps/ stages as I go. This might be quite entertaining... in a kitten with duct tape stuck on its paws sort of way."

213016,kickingfrog,2008-06-09 13:34:00,8333,"I used Cabela's, I've ordered other tackle from them and have been happy with the experience. Always interested in giving a local/ Canadian business a chance, so if anybody has some other rod building options pass them on."
213019,Spiel,2008-06-09 13:41:00,9065,....I'll be happy to offer any assistance and guidance you may wish to solicit.
213022,Stoty,2008-06-09 13:47:00,2910,I will take you up on that offer! Where is a good place to get rod building supplies in Canada?
213023,Spiel,2008-06-09 13:52:00,9065, That is a good question and since my supplier is closing it's doors I also would like and answer to that question. Anyone?
