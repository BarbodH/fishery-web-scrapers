212457,Mattones,2008-06-08 03:55:00,587,Today I bought a new rod and I asked the guy at the fishing store what I would need for carp fishing. He set me up with the items I needed for carp fishing also gave me 50% off a bag of natural bollies. I went out tonight and just before I dropped my line in the water I saw two large carp swimming along the dock.  Are these bollies I bought any good still? I'm guessing they have been sitting there for a while in the package. The guy also told me to put cornstarch or something it my ''carp feeder''. Does anyone actually use one of these 'carp feeders'' and a bollie?  I'm a newbie to this soI'm sorry if any of my question sound dumb.

212472,Victor,2008-06-08 05:21:00,1609,"do up a search on google, you'll find lots of info. Many people use feeders and bollies. Only thing is that it might be tough fishing for them right now ... temps has finally gone up and they have started spawning. When they spawn they don't eat. Give it some time and try again!"
212495,ccmtcanada,2008-06-08 11:10:00,7971,Feeders and boilies are what Bly and I use for carp.  Carp can be very choosy at times....one day they cant leave your stuff alone and the next they are off feeding....keep at it!
212509,Beans,2008-06-08 12:50:00,3339,"I like to add a couple of kernals of softened maize along with a boilie on my hair rig and I use a ""feeder""  I bought a new bag of D.A.M. boilies this spring and am about to grind the remaining Nash boilies I have left over from two years ago and add to my ""ground"" bait...Next lot will have either ground Cat Chow or Dog Chow...Haven't decided yet..."
212626,Mattones,2008-06-08 17:17:00,587,Awesome thanks for the replies everyone. I am going to be heading out in a few moments after going to Longos and buying some stuff for my feeder. Canned Corn? Wouldnt the can corn just fall out of the feeder as its mixed with liqiud? or do i just toss it on the water.  I'm pretty confused about what I shoud be using in this feeder.
