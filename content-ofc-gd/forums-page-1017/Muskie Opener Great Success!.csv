212466,Minnow,2008-06-08 04:47:00,177,"Headed out for muskie opener today, left the house at 3 AM and we were on the water by 5:30 AM  Started throwing bucktails and spinners and within the first 10 min at the weedbed I get a massive fish follow my bait to the boat!  I throw out the cast again and work it slower through the same area, BAM! Fish on first muskie of the season and not a bad fish at all! After we brought her to the boat she measured 44 inches and was thick healthy fish. Didn't need much reviving took off right away and after this fish we only saw one more follow and that was it for our muskie opener! At least we didn't get skunked and I did get a PB so I can say that I am very happy! Also the Ranger has been muskie slimmed for the first time and definately not the last!  Here is a pic of the fish  "
