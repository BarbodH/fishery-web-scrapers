211041,JeffBornFishin,2008-06-05 00:21:00,260,"Well done Holdfast!  I declined the SRR option when I left the CF in 1992.  Wonder how much the program has changed since that time.  I was told you keep your kit, could be activated at any time, one full week training/exercise a year and something once a month.  Your experience will be a big benefit for the Regiment.  Where does the time go eh?"
211140,holdfast,2008-06-05 03:37:00,1813,"Basically if you opt for Supplementary Reserve upon Release, the Military will hang onto your docs up to 2 years.  It makes volunteering easier for everybody as you go directly back in to either the Reserve or Reg forces.  The only thing they allowed me to keep was my ceremonial uniform (CFs) and footwear.  What I did was in February, I contacted the North Sask Regiment, and it seemed that a few pers knew me as I probably taught them or they were part of my staff when I instructed in the Battle School. The Commanding Officer then contacted me said he heard a lot of good things about me, and then stated although I am not Infantry he had a position for a Combat Arms Warrant Officer in which I could fill.  You have to realize that a Unit has so much of a Budget and they're just not going to take anyone as they are also responsible for pay and any other expenses incurred.  Basically, if you re-enrol, you have to fill a position in which the CO must request through Brigade.  As far as obligations, I am not to sure, but you definitely have to show up so many times at a certain period of time otherwise your contract is ripped.  Presently the Canadian Armed Forces are so Tasked, that a Reservist has an excellent chance to fill in as a Reg force member for a certain period of time up to a two year contract.  This includes over Seas Missions, especially Afghanistan.  But the good thing about it, is that you have a choice.  Unfortunately unlike the Americans, you can loose your job at home, as our employers are not legally obligated to keep you if you go on the call of duty.  It is so hard to get a reservist trained as their priority is either their job or schooling.  But the training they do get is exactly the same as a Reg Force however some courses may be shorter which can become a problem."

211669,Pike_Nut71,2008-06-06 10:57:00,18,"I'll be finishing my 20 years Regular Force service in April 09. I have enjoyed the time and look forward to many more years service as a reservist. I had three tours, Bosnia, Kosovo, and the Middle East. There is no other job like it. I thank you all for your kind words of respect, as I recall the days when the military was not as well regarded.  Tony"

210488,holdfast,2008-06-03 23:15:00,1813,"Just got a call today from the Reserve Unit and finally the paperwork has made its way back to the Unit.  I will be enrolling in an Infantry Unit, keeping my Combat Engineer Cap Badge and Rank that I had before I retired about a year and a half ago.  Since I kept myself on the Supplimentry Reserve list, I would of only had 2 years to make the desision.  Good thing that I have been working out since January as I will have to pass the Pysical tests which I am quite confident I will excell for my age category.  I will be proud to give and offer my services and experience to the young soldiers that have bravely answered to the call of duty for this country.  They are the people I have the most respect for in this country."

Dan aka WB  My brother in Law was the RSS( Reg Force) Training Warrant for that same Regiment till recently. Hes currently working in NDHQ. Your son would know who he is if you told him that he is a Big Guy with a French Last name. Ive also met the RSM (Might be former) through my Brother inLaw. Go figure, he was my Sgt in Bosnia, I his second in Command, he ended up being my best friend, introed him to my wifes sister, now my in Law. Your son picked one of the most challenging and dangerous trades in the forces. I am sure that he has enjoyed some of the unique skills that he has learned. My hats off to him  He is actually leaving as soon as school is over for Gagetown, for his QL 1-2-3. And he will do his QL 4-5-6 next summer. I don't think that he wants to make it a full-time career though for now. He is starting college in the Fall to join the Police forces. But I wouldn't doubt that he will change his mind sooner or later."
