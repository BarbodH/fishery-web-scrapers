I was targeting perch.. managed to get 9 keepers .. fished the peir again Sat morning (2 hours) and got another 7 keeper perch (quite a few dinks)  .. there were hitting hard but just not in thick yet ... hopefully by next weekend .. decided to troll the river since the perch werent cooperating .. the first trolling pass I ended up getting 2 pics and a channel cat .. not a half hour later I got a few more .. ended up getting 5 eye's, 3 channels, and 5 sheetheads ... went to a friends place but he wasnt home (Mudcat festival weekend) so I headed to his inlaws and couldnt get a parking spot for the van and boat so i went back to his place anyways .. cleaned up my fish and decided to have a little walleye fry    after a feast and a beer I headed back out to the peir .. got another 7 perch for the table .. again the sheepheads were getting slaughtered .. Sunday morning I started trolling early .. didnt get any keeper walleye but did catch a few cigars which is good for the future of the Grand .. managed to get 4 sheetheads, 4 channels (even a biggen) .. a smallie, and even a rockbass    realeased this one in front of my friends daughters bobber .. she was fishing in the Mudcat kids derby  next weekend going to get my son out for some perch fishing .. hopefully they will be in thicker by then"
212794,danbouck,2008-06-08 23:30:00,4380,Great Report! I hope to get down there soon if the calendar co-operates.
212818,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-06-09 00:07:00,0,Great report and nice cat. What were you trolling with? Live bait(worm harness) or crank baits?
212829,Mike Pike,2008-06-09 00:25:00,1332,"Great report, and pics.  I dunno why but I really like when folks post pics right down to the fish fry!  Mmmmm...  Anyhoo, nice to hear that some folks are haversting sheephead.  Can't bring myself to take one home for the table but that's my own predudice.  I saw an old Babe Winkleman episode( when his wife used to do a cooking section in it ).  She prepared a sheepshead and yup, it did look good enough to eat.  It sure would take the pressure of some of our other game fish too."
212833,mattyk,2008-06-09 00:36:00,2110,nice looking cat!
212846,brifishrgy,2008-06-09 01:07:00,559, Crankbait .. in the firetiger variety
212852,brifishrgy,2008-06-09 01:10:00,559, I cant bring myself to do it either .. but when you think about it they have the same diet as a walleye .. still cant do it though but I know a few who have tried it and say its ok
213004,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-06-09 13:03:00,0," I once went fishing with a guy that wanted to keep sheephead on the grand. I let him keep only a few telling him he probably wont like them, but he loved them! He wanted to go get more!"
