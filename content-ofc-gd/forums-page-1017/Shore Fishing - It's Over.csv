212602,Clampet,2008-06-08 16:24:00,1947,"Yeah, that's right, save yer gas money if you plan on driving any distance to a shore fishing spot, cause the heat will have driven most if not all (well maybe except carp) fish species to the cooler depths to escape the heat."
212619,BabyHerc,2008-06-08 16:52:00,285,"I disagree, water temps are low to mid 70s, which is not too hot just yet.  Maybe 2 or 3 days of this weather and it's time to hit the beach sans fishing rod."
212623,Ryan Landry,2008-06-08 17:11:00,128,"We were catching eye's at 1:30 in the afternoon on saturday in the kawarathas. My buddy even caught his pb at almost 8 lbs and 30"". All were caught off shore.  Ryan"
212625,Mike the Pike,2008-06-08 17:16:00,3421,Well temps here in Montreal on the St-Lawrence were 61 F lower than usual for this time of year.Of course we do live more North lol.  2 walleyes caught yesterday close to shore by boat were both caught in 6 ft of water on a hot sunny day.  Paul if you move around you can find the fish especially in the evening.Unfortunately you will have to burn more gas  Good Luck on your next outing.
212628,Greencoachdog,2008-06-08 17:22:00,8163,"At night and the wee hours of the morning will be good from shore, during daylight hours for Sunfish."
212675,EC1,2008-06-08 19:32:00,930,"I wouldnt say its over at all, but i have to agree with you that the fact that the fishing from shore has slowed down tons. when i was out last night, the panfish were still on, and you will just need more patience with your time from shore. Fish swim, and theyre not going to stay in the same spot for their entire life. Btw, the weather is hopefully going to be like how it was forecasted, and it should liven up the shore fishing once again in the next week."
212799,MCTFisher9120,2008-06-08 23:40:00,3761,"Shore fishing works good for me all year round. Personally i don't think it affects the bass. Not being use to boat fishing i fish from shore all year long, i have cought bass in under foot deep of water. As long as there are weeds to give off oxygen the bass are fine, as for pike, musky etc....im not to sure. Up at Baptist Lake near Bancroft i have seen Large Musky  just cruising the shoreline in the heat of summer. It depends on the species and the structure of tha area."
212801,crappieperchhunter,2008-06-08 23:42:00,2582,Not sure where you fish Clamp-It...but we catch eyes from shore ALL season long up in the Kawartha's.
212819,Mike Pike,2008-06-09 00:13:00,1332,Shore fishing never ends if you enjoy fishing rivers!
212863,Guest gbfisher,2008-06-09 01:48:00,0,  Is that so..... sorry to hear that.
212882,Greencoachdog,2008-06-09 02:27:00,8163," I think it'd be pretty safe to say that Wall-ices from shore during daylight hours will be a pretty tough go for the next couple of months... but what does it matter to someone that's just gonna skulk around the ceement pond anyway?  Catfish on the other hand really like the warm water and will take the Wall-ices place, find some clean water with Catfish in it and you'll be throwin' rocks at them scrawny Wall-ice!!!"
212886,kemper,2008-06-09 02:56:00,2232,Not even close to done for me...actually where I fish is still a little chilly for the best fishing...
212997,Greencoachdog,2008-06-09 12:49:00,8163, ... and then one day when he was fishin' for some food...
213048,ccmtcanada,2008-06-09 15:26:00,7971,Bly does pretty good with great eater sized browns thru July and August from shore.
213069,Greencoachdog,2008-06-09 16:12:00,8163, Bly is the Brown Trout Queen!!!  ... and I remember exactly what kind of bait she was using!  ... hope I wasn't s'posed to keep that secret!
213122,tdotfisherman,2008-06-09 18:03:00,317,"Speaking of Brown Trout, the shore action is really starting to heat up around Lake Ontario for them. Plenty of nice sized Pike still kicking around as well (25-30"" ers), even with the very high heat.."
213185,LeXXington,2008-06-09 20:09:00,1928,The big lake water is still cooler that it should be.. just means the flea's will be a little late this year
