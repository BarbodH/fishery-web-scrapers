405911,StoneFly,2009-11-27 01:46:00,574,"After a couple appointments this morning, I decided I was gonna hit one of my favorite tribs and Im glad I did.  Although it had rained and the water was up and a little dirty, the bite was on.  Lost a few due to logs and poor hook sets, but managed a couple also.  Went 6/11.  Dropped my camera at the last hole on the way out as it was getting Dark and didnt notice until about 10 minutes later,...went back and there it was 12"" under water, lol.  It was time for a new one anyway.  Surprisingly the Card survived.  Who Knew?  lol.              "

405953,raptorfan,2009-11-27 03:48:00,126,sweet fish man.......looks like a fantastic day to me.  Good Job
405956,[emailÂ protected],2009-11-27 04:17:00,290,Nice Fish.  You gotta get a Waterproof camera  I picked up an Olympus Stylus Tough 6000. Works 10 feet underwater
405961,KelfuN,2009-11-27 04:24:00,246,save some fish for me!!! i can't get out till saturday..
405966,StoneFly,2009-11-27 04:30:00,574,"  Even though it was under water for atleast 10 minutes,...i just popped the batts back in and it actually turned on, but no screen,...lol....im drying it out a little more to see what will happen, but you are right, the next cam is waterproof for sure....however if this 2004 3.2 megapixel comes back to life after that it deserves some more pics..."
405969,BassAsin,2009-11-27 04:34:00,806,"hahaha    ""hunny i accidently dropped my camera in the water""   i need a new one    i wanna hear how that one goes over lol  good lookin day out a few nice lookin ones too."

405996,solopaddler,2009-11-27 12:17:00,8605,"Some solid fish there, nice job. I destroyed 3 cameras myself before I bought my current waterproof and shockproof unit. It's really nice not having to worry about wreaking it anymore."
406022,silverstreak,2009-11-27 13:48:00,146,Nice Chrome. Let your camera dry out and it might work again. Same thing happened to me.
406187,tributaryhunter,2009-11-27 22:00:00,108,"nice chrome bud gongrats, hopefully i get some tom"
406223,Leecher,2009-11-27 23:19:00,7832,Great report and pics StoneFly Got to love last minute decisions and getting into some beauties Great job and thanks for sharing Leechman
406290,bowshep,2009-11-28 03:38:00,378,Nice Job Mike... Since your camera is down l will finally start catching... Then again it might not mater
406291,Gerritt,2009-11-28 03:42:00,6129,"put that camera in a large bag, then fill the bag with rice... enough to cover the camera... and leave it for a few days or longer  G"
406292,BillM,2009-11-28 03:47:00,17367,Nice fish!!  Water rarely ruins electronics... It's when you turn them on when still wet that does  I dropped my SD780IS in the drink while on a trip to Mike cottage.. a bowl of rice and 4 days later I was back in action.
406298,Dutchy,2009-11-28 04:56:00,416,"Beautiful looking fish. Looks like a quality fishing afternoon.  I dropped my camera in the Maitland and it had a fuzzy screen for awhile, but dried out eventually. Pity, I really wanted to get a new camera too, but oh well, I cannot justify it to myself no matter how I try"
406869,StoneFly,2009-11-30 02:24:00,574,"Thanks for all the tips on the wet cam guys,...I made the mistake of turning it on several times before i read the posts,...lol...HOWEVER,..it is now 3 days later,..I poped the batts in and it seems to work ok,..thanks again,...hope to be putting it to good use soon.  Too bad my lady wasnt coming over tonite,..coulda tested it out ...."
