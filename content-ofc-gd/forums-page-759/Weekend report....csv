It swam beside another guy out in the middle of the river and he said it was at least 30 inches...  I fought it for a couple minutes and it took me across the river where it proceeded to snap (?) my leader.  I'm beginning to wonder if I should switch knots. I've been using the improved clinch, and I think its slipping.  Maybe next outing I will use the Davy knot.  Anyways, on Saturday tribhunter and I walked all the way down a creek.. Long walk  Today, I decided to walk up the creek and learn to read the water.  I must say it is pretty fun just walking along the water mapping out where fish should be and all the little nuances.  I don't really like creek fishing as I didn't have any success... I have only hooked into fish in the bigger rivers.  So thats pretty much what I have to say... I hope next time I go out I can land multiple fish...    Oh ya, and if anyone finds a pair of silver XPS sunglasses with brown lens floating somewhere let me know"
406825,StoneFly,2009-11-30 01:18:00,574," Spit on your knot before you tie it,..nothing wrong the clinch if you tie it right,..whats your leader?"
406829,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-11-30 01:26:00,0,"given the absence of a drag on a pin, i would think this could just be learning the ropes of a manual drag... busting off steel is par for the course."
406841,BillM,2009-11-30 01:44:00,17367,"Yup, just gotta take it easy on these fish when you get them hooked.  Let them play out in the current all they want, you can't horse these things...  If I can, I like tying a palomar knot."
406856,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-11-30 02:00:00,0,"i do too.  i think because of the thinner diameter, a palomars double passthru is advantageous. that said, i still snapped off 2 of 7 this weekend...it's inevitable..."
406957,[email protected],2009-11-30 13:59:00,290," I think at that time I was using 4.5lb Raven fluoro   I went to tie on some 4.4lb Frog hair, and I noticed that CPA sent me 4.4KG frog hair.. (10lb) lol....  Gonna have to email him to see what we can do."
406974,Greencoachdog,2009-11-30 15:07:00,8163, Yeah Buddy!!!... been using the improved clinch all my life!!!
406980,[email protected],2009-11-30 15:29:00,290,  How many times do you wrap it around the line?
406987,BillM,2009-11-30 15:49:00,17367, With flouro?  6-7times..  Also use an improved clinch if you have to tie a clinch knot.
406992,[email protected],2009-11-30 15:58:00,290,"  Yeah I use the improved clinch.  I'm not sure if its breaking or if its slipping.  The palomar knot looks good, but tying in in the middle of a river seems impractical.  Davy knot here I come!"
407022,young_one,2009-11-30 17:54:00,620,"If it is the knot issue, I only stick to 2 knots.  hook(snell knot)---leader---(parlamor)swival(parlamor)----mainline http://www.animatedknots.com/snell/index.php""]Snell Knot[/url]  Make sure you wet the knot before tightening"
407029,BillM,2009-11-30 18:32:00,17367," What's the line look like?  If it's not curled up, it's most likely snapping and not coming undone..  I have no issues tying a palomar in the middle of a river, quicker then a clinch for me..  The Davy knot looks awesome, I'll try that out on Wednesday."
