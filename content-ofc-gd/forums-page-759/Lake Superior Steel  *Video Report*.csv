406857,troutologist,2009-11-30 02:00:00,951,"RIGHT ON!!  I likes it alot.  Keep up the good work. Old shaky boots will get the camera down yet.   Didn't realized you guys did that well. Talked to winger last night, but we were into it out at camp and the details are fuzzy!   That seam is generous this fall!"
406863,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-11-30 02:05:00,0," This week the water was so low I was able to fish a half dozen new holes... Seems every likely spot had fish. That seam is definitely good and I've got a weight/float rig that seems to work...  Maybe the reason winger didn't lead you to believe we did that well was because he didn't do well again. The steelhead gods got it in for him this year...  He landed one fish that was about 8 inches and that was his excitement for the day.  As a result, he was too slow (didn't care) to man the video cam for most of the fish.  He got his grumpy face every time i'd set the hook into one..."
