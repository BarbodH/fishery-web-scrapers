406930,singingdog,2009-11-30 11:22:00,1047,"Great report, awesome fish!  Word of advice....keep those lakes to yourself. I have a few of those and learned the hard way to not let anyone else in on them. All it takes to change a lake like that forever is one boat with 3 guys that like to keep big fish."
405513,Fishing 24/7,2009-11-25 22:18:00,709,"Well With all of Spinnerbaitkings's report He got me thinking .........SLOW DOWN YOU FOOL.  I took his advice and started to Find the Big ones!!!  Took my Work buddy with me for the ride!  As we get on the lake, i tell him how we always get a fish on the first cast....  He took the first cast...... FISH ON! unbelievable.    Its a Pike and the only one of the day.  Then i head out on the hunt.  Flip a YUM Brown Crayfish  on a rocky drop of and land my first of the day!    SWEET BRONZY!    A LA justin hoffman style!  This is Sly first small mouth outting of the year...  Its never to late to learn new stuff so i teach him the techniques..... He picked up FAST!    BOOM. his first! CONGRATS!  The bite is slow.... is this because im working my bait to fast.... YES!!!!  i slow it down a bit... SMACK he takes it.    Sly takes a cast right beside my honey hole... SMACK!  He lands one.    Well now we have it made !!  We leave this spot and hit one of my favourite part of the lake. ...  i call this point '' nickel point''  Let the YUM fall on the drop and i set the hook.    This one was feeding heavy!  Cristal clear lake........    Switching spots to the '' nickel'' point was the best idea i had.  Bass were STACKED one on top of the other.    FRENZY!!!    4 bass BACK 2 BACK!  had to take another shot of this one.... BEAUTY!    Then i switch it up a little bit.  i decide to go for pike ...  so i cast a 1 Oz chartreuse spinner bait from Northam...... let the bait copter in 15 FOW  Then i started to reel it in ... SLOW... i Feel a THUMP!  set the hook..... dead weight..... pike ?!!?!  Nope a 4.11Lbs Small Mouth Bass!!     Northam # 1    Then it was SLy's turn....  He flip's the crayfish on a drop that goes from 15 - 30 FOW.  Sets the hook hard and the fight is on...  He lands this beauty of a FOOTBALL!      This fish regurgitated a small pike !    release the beast!  Great day to be out .   The forecast was suposed to be rainy and 15 km/h winds....  but ended up beeing drizzle with NO wind!    to mother nature .  I LOVE YOU!"
