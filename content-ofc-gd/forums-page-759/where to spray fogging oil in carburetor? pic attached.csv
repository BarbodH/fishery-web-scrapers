407059,aniceguy,2009-11-30 19:35:00,1094,remove the plugs shoot a stream in for 5 seconds per plug turn the engine over but dont start it thats it
407061,Fish4Eyes,2009-11-30 19:39:00,1022,"Ive been reading, and its saying to fog the cylinders as well"
407078,Fang,2009-11-30 20:07:00,1330,best to do this with the engine running (need water mufflers). You basically spray into the carb until the motor starts bogging out ready to stall. Shut the motor down and then take out the plugs and spray a bit in each cylinder. I crank it over once more just to move the pistons around - don't fire it up again though or it will brun off the fogging.  With that you'll be good till spring. Don't forget to add gas stabilizer to the tank too!
407079,Daplumma,2009-11-30 20:10:00,1961,"You need to remove the ""filter""and spray into the the carbs until it is choking out.Cut off motor and pull the plugs.Squirt some into each cylinder and turn motor over by hand. Joe"
407081,aniceguy,2009-11-30 20:15:00,1094,with my fuel injected engines I have had I just shot through the plugs no where else....
407087,Jer,2009-11-30 20:28:00,1426,"There should be a ""tire valve"" type fitting somewhere on the other side of the motor. The fogging can from OMC, sorry BRP, has a fitting that threads right on that valve. Follow the directions on the can and you're done. You shouldn't have to remove the air filter or the plugs."
407088,DanD,2009-11-30 20:30:00,2223,Both ways are a good piece of maintenance but fogging on a 4 stroke is about the only way you’re going to get oil on the valve guides and stems. A 2 stroke’s valuing already has oil on them via the fuel mix. Just remember liquids do NOT compress; so be careful not to spray too much of anything at once; it’s amazing what 1500rpm and a hydrostatic lock can break or bend. LOL  Dan.
407137,Sinker,2009-11-30 22:59:00,8692,"I've never fogged a motor in my life, and I haven't had any issues with mine. I think its over rated myself.  S."
407282,Fish4Eyes,2009-12-01 13:09:00,1022,"For those who still need to winterize, take a look at your choke switch, the ""maintenance valve"" is attached directly below it (on some motors) it looks like a tire valve, like mentioned above. Saved me alot of work. Lower unit screws requiring a 2-3mm depth flathead is another story.....lol."
