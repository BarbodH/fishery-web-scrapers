406339,troutologist,2009-11-28 17:23:00,951,"The last few weeks I have been out piecing together a late fall trolling pattern for giant esox. We've had a few great days and have been beat by the fish other days. Trying to get a giant muskie on film has been difficult, with the big ones being caught when the camera is not in the boat....  Lots of big pike though, these fish are gorging on bait. Sometimes you've got to have faith in the deep water....  Not many pics on my camera but a sampler from 42fow....slammed a crazy crippler in firetiger.    Pic doesn't come close to doing it justice. It was FAT!"
406340,walleye_man,2009-11-28 17:26:00,135,THAT IS A MONSTER congrats
406346,johnnyb,2009-11-28 18:02:00,3413,"Nicely done, Jay...you have to get someone to put the camera in the boat without you being aware of it if you want to get the monsters on film.  Not that the pike you're holding in that shot isn't a beast..."

406862,troutologist,2009-11-30 02:04:00,951,"  I'll be out this winter and next year, we'll get together for a fish.    Agreed, can't wait for ice.     Thanks for the words folks....fish was not down 42 feet down around 25....the lure of the fall has been that crazy crippler. It did for 2 more muskie today...stay tuned for the pics we ran into a couple nice fatties today."
