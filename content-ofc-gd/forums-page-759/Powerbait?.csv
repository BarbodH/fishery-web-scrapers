I love these little tubes...awesome on the ice for a range of species....i've even caught big(ish) Lakers on them. Can anyone send me a link to a store (Canadian preferably) where i can purchase these online?  Thanks   Simon ( still waiting for the ice  )"

406641,Greencoachdog,2009-11-29 18:42:00,8163,"Hey Simon!... If you can't find the tubes, give the Berkley Gulp Fish Fry a shot... but get the 2 inchers, the 1 inch are too small in my opinion.  They're available at BassPro."

I find 'em all the time @ Canadian Tire & LeBarons.  EDIT: I think I've seen them @ JB's Fishing Depot too  *I'm going there tomorrow after work... I'll hopefully remember and report back*"
