Which by myself I cant afford. So I have been left with 2 options. 1- get a roommate or 2- move home.... Im 24 and I really dont want to move home !  SO im looking at the room mate option....  Im just lookin for some advice for people that have gone through this ??? What kind of things to look for or cover before agreeing to someone moving in ?    I know its not fishing related but I need to some help quick.... Thanks !!!!

Cash a week before month end for their half the rent.. so you can cover the cheque at first of month. No money, they're out.. no second chances. Minimal ""sleep overs"" otherwise their's (or your) portion of the rent becomes 66% . And don't limit your choices to a guy... daughter and her male apartment mate get along great in their seperate rooms. Both are ""attached"" to others..."
