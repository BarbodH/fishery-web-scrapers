406281,Fisherman,2009-11-28 02:54:00,7201,"I have the Medium Ice Cabin, 2 person, only I didn't get the bench seat or 2 swivel singles, I'm going to make something for this winter instead of folding beach chairs.  The sled is made of thick poly, hardly any flex, the top material is pretty thick too, sewn in attachment goes all the way around and simply snaps on, no screwing needed, the superstructure is made of square poles, they expand and collapse without problems.  I see the info sheet says 90lbs, maybe a mistake or I'm getting stronger(highly doubt it).  Get the extra runners, they take up a lot of road wear, got mine at BPS for about $35, they should last 2-3 winters.  I made my own tow bar, I have my MIG for that.  So far, no complaints compared to that Pile of Bovine Excrement from Frabil the year before.  It's long enough to accomodate the Jiffy auger.   Unless you have someone with seamstress qualifications, maybe get the custom cover too, keeps your kit in and snowbanks out."
406294,GeorgeJ,2009-11-28 04:10:00,207,  Fisherman where did you buy it? seems like they don't have many distributors in Ontario
406309,Fisherman,2009-11-28 12:30:00,7201,"I called their 1-800 number, bought direct from the factory in the US and paid the shipping rather than to buy from the dealers in Northern Ontario who were a bid more than greedy.  There is one place somewhere around Toronto, another distribution center, however I could never connect with them on the phone."
406328,watertight,2009-11-28 16:20:00,50,"George J , I think Pro Tackle in Wallaceburg sells otter ice huts. (519) 627-8600."
406332,troutologist,2009-11-28 17:13:00,951,"  I agree comletely. Thats the reason I bought the sled, to expand my opportunities as well as make going to camp in the winter easier. Never had a power auger, though with that much ice you'd be crazy not to have one. Late season we drill 3 feet or so, most of our deepest ice is really punky and not solid, due to the big dumps of snow, so its not that bad. Plus I have a 6"" auger which chews pretty quick.  Dave, let me know if you want some GPS points of some spots in the east arm. Ive got a bunch of reefs marked and also quite a few ice out bays, there are definitely preferred ones that the trout are in at ice out, so I assume they'd be nearby during the later winter.  ....to icefish the east arm of slave i'd walk!! Then probably wait for the sea lift to come out for a ride back in August!"
406348,Mike the Pike,2009-11-28 18:07:00,3421,Its only leg and arm power for me as I only get out a few times per year .  My son pulls the sled full of fishing gear and I pull the ice hut out onto the ice.  We have an 8 inch hand auger that builds and rips the biceps.  MTP Bring on the ice.          
406380,johnnyb,2009-11-28 19:39:00,3413,"Oh my goodness.... I didn't think ice-fisherman bickered about anything...but we have a new topic -- who's sled is best?!?  Stuck at work and can only picture my setup in my head...can't access any pics from here to post   But I go on foot most times, pulling the 2-seat fish trap with buddy heater and tackle inside.  If the 5-ton plow is on Temagami, then I take the Jeep out there   Easy to drive out somewhere between Manito and Bear Island, park, and wander off to start drilling holes.  The 8-inch Normark hand auger is still fine with me...new blades in it's 3rd or 4th season had it practically pulling itself through the ice...and where I go I usually have to deal with 3 feet tops."
406440,DRIFTER_016,2009-11-28 23:30:00,10439," Last spring I drilled through 64"" of hard black ice!!! I have an 18"" extension for my power auger and still needed to drill down a few inches on either side of the hole to clear the handles and punch through the last 2 or 3 inches of ice.  I'd love a bunch of GPS coordinates!!!!!! Thanks!!!! You have a PM."
406493,Dara,2009-11-29 02:01:00,3052,"I got away from fishing the last little while. I hit the trails a lot. Still get a couple fishing trips in, but there is just something about winter going by fast that gets me going.  About4500km a year.  "

405788,GeorgeJ,2009-11-26 20:49:00,207,"I'm setting up for ice fishing for the first time this winter, so far I bought a used Argo, a new ice auger and a couple of rods. I still need a ice hut, I want a portable not sure if I should get one with a floor or what other options to look for. I'm not sure what else as far as equipment I will need, so considering the time of year and inspiration from pxtyson's thread I think it be great to see what others are using for equipment and how they are getting it to and from their favorite ice fishing hole!"

I beat the crap out of that hut last year with 60+ days of ice fishing.  The tent material is okay, but the runners were destroyed and the sled itself even cracked.  The sled is too shallow for the conditions up here.  Oh yeah, and the cover was completely destroyed. haha.   That auger isn't mine, I'm getting a 10"" Eskimo for this season."

406101,DRIFTER_016,2009-11-27 16:23:00,10439,  You're screwed if you get stuck?? I have yet to get mine stuck other than once on the lake. If I get stuck in the bush I'm in serious trouble as my sled has a 1000cc 4 stroke and weighs 700 pounds dry!!!! It goes like a Raped Ape though!!!!      Also it has the power to get me out of slushy situations in a nano second. It's pretty comfortable too.    I have a winch for it but haven't installed it yet. I'm going to build a new rear bumper for my sled with the winch built in.

406115,troutologist,2009-11-27 17:12:00,951,"Enjoy those big sleds lads...when im not on the GV snowshoes its the tundra.  No trail...no problem....get stuck lift the back end with one hand.....no snowbank or ramp to get it into the back of the truck....lift it.   I don't have to go 100mph to fish i just go where the big sleds can't.   Snowshoes are still the best method, anders can attest it keeps the riff raff (besides me) away. Also the only time the shoes have trouble starting is after a night on the town."

406256,troutologist,2009-11-28 01:20:00,951,"No I fully suggest you keep your awesome sled. I'll keep on breaking trail into my lakes and getting stuck, mired in slush, not being able to spin the track and spend my day pulling it out. But amazingly managing to get there and back and catch fish, good thing theres no mountains around the Soo or I'd be snookered for sure though. Snowshoes being too much work for folks is why I use em....wolf tracks and otter slides are all you should see on the lake."
406259,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-11-28 01:30:00,0,"Sleds are fun for riding trails and puttering around but when it comes time to fish I'm on foot. I'm still young, it's good for me, and I experience fishing better than most people see.  Plus it's good to go a day without some fluorescent coloured yahoo ripping by you on a sled."
406273,DRIFTER_016,2009-11-28 02:13:00,10439," The one time I got stuck was trying to climb over the snow berm at the edge of one of our ice roads. The snow under the crust was all corn snow and it just blew out. I would have hit it with some speed but I was pulling a boggan and didn't want my ice fishing stuff spread all over the place.   Troutologist There is nothing wrong with snowshoeing into lakes, I have friends up here that do it all the time. They're a bunch of Tundra Huggers though!!!     Anyone that uses a hand auger to go through 4 feet of ice after snowshoeing 10 km into a lake is a few fries short of a Happy Meal in my book. Myself, I would rather spend the time they spend walking into a lake I can sled into, FISHING!!! One of my favorite fishing lakes is a 40km round trip, you can walk in if you like. I have a week long fishing trip planned for the East Arm of Great Slave Lake at the end of March. It's a 400km round trip. Feel like walking 400kms with camping and fishing supplies for a week? I thought not. Besides I'm too old and fat to be doing all that walking, snowshoeing, hand augering crap any way."
