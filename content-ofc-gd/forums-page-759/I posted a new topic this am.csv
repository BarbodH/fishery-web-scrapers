I know that I did hit the right button because it didn;t take me to the review screen. This is the second time this happened to me.  This one really bugged me because it was story of my adventures in learning to use my float reel yesterday,.. never occurred to me to copy the post.. just in case...   If anyone knows how to search in the site or on my PC to find it, I would appreciate it.  Thanks  Splashhopper"
