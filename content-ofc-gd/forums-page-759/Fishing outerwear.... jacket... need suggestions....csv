406761,Burtess,2009-11-29 23:28:00,901,"I am looking for a jacket to wear fishing.  A light insulation would be good, not heavy, as I prefer to layer up underneath.  Water repellentcy would be beneficial, but I have rain gear for really rainy days. It will be used when bush bashing and wading in the fall/winter.  Number of pockets is not really important as I wear a hip pack and usually carry a backpack as well.  What have you found to be good???  Burt"
406783,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-11-29 23:55:00,0,"i would recommend a gore tex wading coat.  if you like spending money, simms makes incredible stuff..  i myself wear this coat:  http://www.cabelas.com/cabelas/en/template...rset=ISO-8859-1  it's water repellent, cut nice and high for deep wading, has waterproof cuffs for release shots, and is very affordable. you won't get a better coat for this price.  the waterproof zippers are seemingly high quality, and function well even when my digits are frozen.  it was cold and snowy yesterday and i was perfectly comfortable all day.l    good luck on the coat hunt."

407025,troutologist,2009-11-30 18:07:00,951,I'll third the G3...unbelievably lightweight and tough. Cabelas had these on sale a while ago...  I also really like my older Cabelas Guide Wear jacket. Its been bombproof.
