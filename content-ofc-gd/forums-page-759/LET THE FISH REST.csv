406445,Steve Piggott,2009-11-28 23:58:00,196,I like fishing for bass from October to May on lake Erie U.S side.Lots of fish and nobody around.It dose not seem to hurt that fishery. It also show that the bass feed all year long.I think they should close it from May to the end of July. When bass are nestig and protecting there young..
406490,fishhunter,2009-11-29 01:52:00,604,I say kill all the Muskie and give us big Asain Carp lol  You dont needs lures just a boat and a crash helmet lol

406514,Slop,2009-11-29 03:21:00,151,"24/7 ....Rick, aka Admin...copy and paste wizzard and member #2 on this site is not the backyard you want to be pooping in.  I think all that has to be said, has been said and then some."
406517,Harrison,2009-11-29 03:22:00,2202,Can't wait til December next year for even bigger giants!  
406529,trapshooter,2009-11-29 03:51:00,1234,Bass should be open year-round in all of Ontario as the are here in NW Ontario.
406567,badman187,2009-11-29 06:23:00,28,Thanks for the comment snapper face stick to making useless lures insted of comedy.
406568,Leecher,2009-11-29 06:30:00,7832, Do I know you??? What you been smokin there son   :blink: I was just making a comment..... sounds like you need some type of therapy to chill out
406569,BassAsin,2009-11-29 06:34:00,806,"that crap just isnt needed here and neither are you, time to grow the hell up and realize your opinion is completly looked at as a bad one learn to take a bit of critisism and you may make it a little bit farther in life.  I think it's time for ya to toss this    Rick.  and i dont think that;s an opinion that will be rejected by others.  Matt!"
406571,Dabluz,2009-11-29 06:56:00,701,"I can understand a person's concern for a species of fish.  But, smallmouth bass in Ontario are doing fine with the fishing pressure they have now.  Not many people eat them and they are a hardy fish.  Too many bass can actually be detrimental to the fishing quality because they tend to stay small if there are too many of them.  On top of that, small bass do not feed on large prey that are most often nuisance fish to begin with.  When the nuisance fish get large, they do a lot of damage to the biomass and the bass have a hard time regaining their place in the structure of the fish population.  Here in Quebec, the smallmouth bass are much smaller and from what I can see, more people eat them than in Ontario.  Catch and release is not as popular in Quebec as it is in Ontario.  Luckily, bass have a great survival rate after getting caught.  As for feeding, they don't seem to have any problems in that department....all the bass that I have seen were quite plump.  North Western Ontario.....seems to me to be about the furthest north that bass are found.  Are these natural waters for smallmouth bass?  Maybe not protecting bass in that area would be good for brook trout and walleye who are in their natural habitat.  I am not a biologist but I do know that there is more to the management of sport fish than arbitrairily (spelling?) all sport fish equally."
406573,badman187,2009-11-29 07:23:00,28,Grow up really?What is your assumtion of someone being grown?I live in a house have a truck and a boat.If you have any other pointers for me I would love to hire you as a personal life coach
406575,Roy,2009-11-29 11:37:00,13728,Let's just chalk this one up to inexperience on the OP's part.
406343,badman187,2009-11-28 17:50:00,28,"I know our season for fishing is short enough but maybe thats why the fishing is so great in Ontario?It must be putting a huge strain on a fish especially a smallmouth that has just been hooked in the middle of november,now that fish just fought for its life and wasted all that energy its been saving up.Oh ya and regurgitated all that food its been tryin to store,so know how is that fish supposed to catch up before a cold front hits?Let them rest"
406349,timmeh,2009-11-28 18:08:00,609,"Not sure about bass specifically but a lot of fish actually fair better when released into cooler water than warmer water. I think one of the reasons bass fishing is good in Ontario is the closed spring season which allows a successful spawn.  Also I think the amount of people who continue fishing bass past thanksgiving is pretty low anyways. Keep in mind while you'll see some posts on boards like this, overall most fisherman are the fair weather types and give up much earlier."
406350,Terry,2009-11-28 18:09:00,14456,as long as you catch them in less then 30ftof water they do great when released this time of year
406351,Mike the Pike,2009-11-28 18:13:00,3421,They get a rest when few start venturing out in their boats.Then the ice fishing season starts.  fishing is to give people a rest clear your head and decompress.  If people fish this time of year good for them I am all for it.  The very little fishing pressure in November will not change anything.   MTP
406354,badman187,2009-11-28 18:20:00,28,Sorry thats what I meant if you give them time to spawn why not give them time to eat and survive a winter?
406356,Roy,2009-11-28 18:27:00,13728, Well then maybe we should give them time to take their offspring to swimming classes and not fish for them at all. There's a middle road to all of this though.
406357,badman187,2009-11-28 18:30:00,28,Ya they do when they are guarding the nest you have plenty of time july august september
406358,Roy,2009-11-28 18:33:00,13728," I guess we should do that with all species of fish, eh?"
406360,cram,2009-11-28 18:40:00,1733,"I don't knwow what the timing is, but once they get schooled up in pods for the winter it might do them some good to leave them be.  There's a reason we don't ice fish for them in the winter.  Or, at least don't keep them in livewells for pics later (or if you do, don't move them to another location....they are schooled up for a reason)."
406363,pikeie,2009-11-28 19:01:00,380," Just sayin not all of ontario has a closed spring bass season   Northwestern ontario for example! bass are open there all year... well except for december 24 lol, i never understood that haha. and the bass fishing up there is still unreal! i went out plenty of days this year and nailed 50 plus smallies! but im not sayin that all of ontario should have a spring season!"
406368,Slop,2009-11-28 19:10:00,151,"Would that be the canadian thanksgiving or american?. In previous years zone 18, the one I mostly fish, Bass were closed on October 15th. This year it has finally been extended to November 30th and I gotta say.....I don't have a guilty bone in my body for picking on these fish before ice up. It has been an exceptional fall for numbers and size....never having to fish any deeper than 12'. I also like the fact that there is very little pressure on these fish in comparison to summer months.  With the fair weather angler, cottager and hunter out of the picture, the Bass are actually getting a rest."
406400,badman187,2009-11-28 20:24:00,28,Really?Your catching more and they are bigger?It wouldnt have anything to do with them being hugry and putting on weight for the winter would it?Canadian thanksgiving
406402,Billy Bob,2009-11-28 21:00:00,5865,"I haven't kept a bass of any kind in over 30 years so I can't see the harm in it. Of all the game fish in my state and in Ontario I would say smallmouth are the most abundant by FAR....so why do you want to 'rest' the smallmouth and not walleye or trout or pike or muskie, etc........"
406413,badman187,2009-11-28 22:03:00,28,Rest them all then didnt mean to discriminate sorry haaaaaaaaaa
406419,BassAsin,2009-11-28 22:36:00,806,oh do i know i guess you dont fight forest fires from april to october like myself and get 4 days off every month.  enoy the monday to fridays do ya?
406420,BassAsin,2009-11-28 22:38:00,806,is the spring season up that way not catch and release only during the spawn?
406421,irishfield,2009-11-28 22:41:00,26272, New Liskeard North.. open all year with same retention limits. Should be the same everywhere.. they are over populated most everywhere.
406423,BassAsin,2009-11-28 22:44:00,806,you just say that because you catch them in 80fow of water downrigging for lakers wayne! hahaha   they are becoming overpopulated big time.
406424,bigfish1965,2009-11-28 22:50:00,3382,"Catching them in July and August does far more harm than catching them now. Smallies are very prevalent everywhere and even where fishing is allowed all year, there is no shortage of them."
406425,gone_fishin,2009-11-28 22:58:00,481,"Well, this may just be the most ridiculous thread that i have ever read... LOL. A fisherman not wanting to fish during, quite possibly the best time of the year to fish... less boat traffic, No cottagers or PWC/power boats... Also, the vast majority of anglers out at this time of year are True Sport-fishermen! i don't see ANY harm in extended fall seasons... that being said, i am really looking forward to fishing the kawarthas late fall next year!!!"
406427,Greencoachdog,2009-11-28 23:01:00,8163, ... and if you'll read this board in Oct. and Nov. you'll see that there are quite a few folks that can't catch a Bass to save their green toothed granny in cold water... try as they might!
406428,irishfield,2009-11-28 23:04:00,26272,Let me get out a couple more times before the season ends for Muskie.. before you want the season shortened for them as well. Your better halfs name isn't Pam by chance...
406432,badman187,2009-11-28 23:12:00,28,"very good how did you guess?Thats to bad you dont get anytime off monday to friday is great,maye rethink your career choice if your complaining.That is a very honorable occupation.So ill fish all summer and you keep the forests under control"
406434,bigfish1965,2009-11-28 23:22:00,3382, You could also rethink your hobby if the idea of fishing for bass is so bothersome..
406435,brifishrgy,2009-11-28 23:23:00,559," you might want to rethink you forum choice if your complaining and take up knitting .. ""no sheep were harmed in the making of these mittens"" .. coming to a fishing site and telling people to stop fishing for the beloved smallmouth cause they need time to rest .. give it up and join a P3TA site"
