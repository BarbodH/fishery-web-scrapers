406888,Garry2Rs,2009-11-30 02:48:00,1425,There is a free parking lot behind Hutch's. I had good success fishing in the canal that leads out from the boat ramp.
406918,ld17,2009-11-30 03:32:00,319,tons of free parking all over the harbour.  Short walk and you can fish many places.  Right now you won't catch any panfish.  You might get some perch behind the discovery centre.  It's deep there 30+ feet.  So use a bit heavier jig or it will take forever to reach bottom.  I fished the harbour all summer right up till last week.  Not many panfish this year.  Lot's more bass and pike.  Most of my goto spots were dead for panfish.  Other years I remember catching lots more.  I think you will have a tough time down there right now.  Good luck if you give it a go.

407232,ld17,2009-12-01 03:45:00,319,october and most of november has been good for pike.  Lots of ways to catch them.  This is the first year in a long time that I've seen good size pike come out from there.
