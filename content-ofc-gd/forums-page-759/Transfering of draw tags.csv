406645,irishfield,2009-11-29 18:52:00,26272,Get it right from the horses mouth Brian.. call CO's Wayne Lintack or Rick Williams. If you need their direct cell #'s PM me !
406703,Fang,2009-11-29 21:48:00,1330,Brian  I'm pretty sure transferring is only for group allocations like moose. As far as I know transferring of deer tags is not done.
406897,paulyboy83,2009-11-30 03:02:00,54,I just finished my hunter safety course and we were instructed that the only tag that is transferrable is a moose tag that has been applied for by a group.  Deer tags are non-transferrable.  PB
