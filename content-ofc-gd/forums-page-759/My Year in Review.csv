My first ever lake trout caught in April.        Last time I ever fished beside Sonny May 2009.You will be missed my friend.                  Percher's prize catch.                     Ah my favorite take a young lad fishing never caught a pike in his life and he lands an 8 pounder. He also caught five pike that day.                  Well thats all until the hard water season.
