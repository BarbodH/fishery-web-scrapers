407006,Fishnwire,2009-11-30 16:43:00,983,"  I could just as easily say if the company was serious about my safety then they would provide all the equipment needed to ensure that I am working as safely as possible.  Having the option to use whatever safety equipment you yourself choose to pay for and having whatever you require provided for you are obviously not the same thing, and the latter is clearly preferable to most if not all individuals.  You're right that ""a lot of companies require you to supply your own safety gear.""  Most non-union shops I've worked for do just that, while every unionized outfit I'm familiar with provides all necessary equipment at no cost to the employee, so thanks for proving my point.  You and I must be two very different people, because I would consider the thousands of dollars of safety gear I need to to my job a very ""big deal.""  The fact is that unlimited free access to the newest and best safety equipment available, as apposed to having to scrounge up whatever you can on your own dime, is a clear example of how (in my experience) working for a unionized company is safer than working for most non unionized ones.  You guys can try to ignore the obvious with illogical arguments all you want but from my experiences, in at least this one example, I happen to know that it is true."

407241,ch312,2009-12-01 04:14:00,1590,"  your strong belief in unions is from your own ignorance. either you are making up stuff as you go or you seriously dont know what the ministry of labor is for and why the CSA and ANSI are around.  Any contractor with more than half a brain would never let an employee work without a harness when its required. the employee would get a stiff fine and the employer would be paying out the ying yang for allowing it. if you do not feel safe you simply report to your supervisor that equipment needs to be replaced or it isnt up to par. if you get fired you simply report to the ministry of labor and let them have fun with your employer. i can speak from experience...the ministry of labor and revenue canada are the last people you want on your tail if you are an employer. just ask my old boss who had to shut down for not playing nice  you feel safer in a union environment? i work for a non union company and often find myself hanging 20 stories up. with my fear of heights i am the last person that would have a job like this unless i knew it was nearly impossible to fall.    i have worked on the same sites as union guys and its quite comical watching them work. i've never seen grown men get so bent out of shape if they start a break late or have to move something heavy themselves. i must say that is very rare though because there are usually 3 others standing around. maybe something is different in union factories, but when it comes to union guys in construction and landscaping you rarely see every guy on site doing something and there is never anyone around after 5. another funny thing i've noticed on different sites is union workers go by seniority rather than experience. seems like the total opposite of the logical thing to do, but all you have to do is think ""union"" to fully understand.  about that concrete company i mentioned before....  when it was non union the guys worked hard and applied themselves daily to earn raises and vacation time. when the union moved in they all became lazy because they knew there was nothing the boss could do about it. in a union you are typically a complete slacker and rely on the union to ensure you get a raise rather than working hard to earn it. in a union you are taught to abuse the system to get it YOUR way.

406792,JohnF,2009-11-30 00:31:00,3494," The way I see it, if there was no Walmart in town there'd be others stepping up and offering employment for those who'd lost jobs. So why not have the benefits of Walmart prices and the jobs as well. I'm afraid that all a union adds to the equation is short term employment at slightly better wages. Ultimately the jobs are ruined by the union and I no longer have the good prices. How many folks are willing to settle for short term employment hyphenated by fruitless strikes culminating in loss of jobs? Dunno what the pay scale averages are under the unions any more but I'll bet it's getting to be better in the long run without union involvement. Of course the union serves a purpose for those who aren't saddled with union dues etc but wouldn't all purposes be served by having a union shop in a town nearby where the press will make a mountain out of any threat strikes. That threat carries over to the non-union sector and helps keep the employers fair. Non-union workers must love the union guys. Long live the unions.  JF"
406808,Fishnwire,2009-11-30 00:56:00,983,"  That's exactly right.  A lot of times non-unionized workers can get compensation close to or as good as their unionized counterparts simply by threatening to go union.  The smart employer realizes that he is better off to give the employees what they're asking for and keep the union out, than allow it in and be forced to make those changes anyway.  A lot of people point to this phenomenon as proof that unions are unnecessary but the opposite is true.  If the non-unionized employees didn't have the choice of becoming unionized, they wouldn't have the leverage to demand the higher standard, not to mention the higher standard wouldn't exist in the first place."
406828,JohnF,2009-11-30 01:24:00,3494," Well, strictly speaking it's the threat of unions that works for the non-union shops, not the unions per se.  JF"

No benefit to the union shops in my company. The union shops make the same but pay union dues so actually take home less. We all get the same compensation packages/benefits.  And as far as Walmart goes....thank god for them. About 20-30% of our print volume is for them. In todays economy we have worked overtime almost every weekend this year and lots of that is due to Walmarts new store openings.  Not to mention I shop there as well. As I mentioned I am a printer. I wear crap cloths to work cause they just get ruined anyway. I can buy track pants for $10 at Walmart instead of paying double, triple or more somewhere else.  Best quality no..but I'm happy paying $10 for ""throw away"" cloths. In the long run Walmart works for me on many levels.

If you don't like the employment opportunities they offer go elsewhere.  Would I want to work there...no. But if you are going to ""settle"" for working there I don't think it is fair for you to whiz and moan about the conditions. It is what it is. Many many companies have temporary or part time staff. It is a norm in todays world. I don't like it at all, but these companies are following the laws that our government made. I can't see how you can blame them for that.

406883,Fishnwire,2009-11-30 02:43:00,983," I'm sorry, but you are absolutely incorrect.  If you had worked as a tradesman in an inherently unsafe environment for both union and non-union companies as I have, you would know that to be a certainty just as I do.  Non-union contractors are often able to do jobs cheaper because of their loser adherence to those standards.  When I didn't have papers and was attempting to gain experience in the field, I often did things on the job that I was uncomfortable with, because I knew that there were dozens of equally unskilled guys ready to do it if I didn't want to.  If you have never been employed by someone who would think nothing of firing you if you made any trouble for him, while not being in a position to risk being fired, consider yourself lucky, but understand that not everyone has it as good as you do.  A lot of guys know that their boss would think nothing of replacing them and simply lying about the reasons for doing so if faced with having to provide the appropriate level of health and safety adherence.  When I worked for a non-union contractor I was expected to buy my own fall-arrest safety harness and lanyard or do without.  At Inco I am given the best money can buy and instructed to throw it away and get a new one if any part of it shows any sign of wear or distress.  Regardless of its condition it is replaced yearly.  I could go on and on with similar examples.  Trust me, I've feel safer every day on the job since I got on with a union company.  There's absolutely no doubt about that.  The other thing is that the ""Health and Safety Act"" merely sets out minimum standards.  Often they don't come close to going far enough and in most cases, could be improved.  I don't know about you, but when it comes to my safety, I'm not always satisfied just doing the minimum.  Often they represent a compromise between maximum worker safety and maximum production.  Unionized employees are able to hold the company to higher standards more effectively than a single unrepresented worker.  Worker represented joint health and safety committees are the norm in every unionized shop I'm familiar with, and I never even heard the term health and safety committee until I joined a union.  It's not ""propaganda""...its a fact."
406899,Fishnwire,2009-11-30 03:05:00,983,"  I could just as easily speculate that GM could have continued to pay its employees excellent wages if their execs hadn't choked the company to death with so many bad decisions.  Which one of us is right would be purely a matter of opinion.  You want to compare the ""$$$$"" the execs are paid and what the workers do?  The top execs often make 2000 times or greater what their average unionized worker makes.  I wouldn't say that is ""nothing compared to what is doled out to the workers.""  Also, I don't know what you do for a living, but I'm sure you don't have your pay ""doled out"" to you, that kind of suggests you didn't earn it.  These guys earn a paycheck the same as me and presumably you."

I would say yes.  Do they treat there employees fairly? I'd say not, ask a employee that spent 22 years in a upper management position that had to make many people cry while walking out the door nuff said.  A union shop intitles a employee to work safely for a fair wage, be free from harassment by the company and it's managers.  Now whats wrong with that?

You're clearly trying desperately hard to find some part of what I've said to pick apart, and if that's the best you can come up with, it should be obvious to you to stop trying.  Why rely on the company to supply it?  Because they're worth several hundred dollars for one.  Did you think they were free?  Why would I feel better about my safety if I pay out of my pocket?  I see the harnesses that these contractors wear...some of them are a decade old and ready to fall apart...that's because they keep using whatever they have because they don't want to spend the money.  If I was being paid as little as them, I wouldn't want to either.  Secondly, if two companies have workers doing the same job, and one expects its workers to supply their own harness or do without while the other company (in part due to union demands) makes harnesses mandatory and supplies them at no cost to it's employees....it's not hard to assume which company is serious about safety and which one must of us would prefer working for.

406555,Paulus,2009-11-29 05:44:00,522," I dislike Walmart and unions alike. Both take advantage of a situation whereby they can either pay people less for the work they do, or get more money from working people while providing a questionable service - where either strong government (or community) support or honest corporate management would ensure that fair salaries were paid for work rendered. Both skew the balance of things, salary wise, imo.  But entities such as Wal-mart make unions necessary. Canada didn't get all the unions it has by accident. They came into existence exactly because employers were irresponsible in providing fair salaries, benefits, etc... You need only look up ""Tommy Douglas"" on google to read up about that. Corporatism has a bloody history, in Canada.  But at the same time, I think unions can over play their value. Having lived in a country where unions are illegal and the poverty level was 48K/year, I can tell you that responsible government is the key.  But... oh yeah! responsible government? in Canada?  Tax more! Offer less!  p.-"
406602,Fishnwire,2009-11-29 14:33:00,983,"  How subtle an attack on my signature.  You're not correct though.  The company began an extended maintenance shut-down in May which was scheduled to last until near September.  Most of us were to be laid off for that period and the strike didn't start until near the end of July.  I often don't agree with the tactics my union leadership employs, believe me...that said, if it wasn't for the right to collective bargaining, I wouldn't have compensation and benefits even worth fighting for.  As a tradesman I know that my non-union counterparts make, on average, 30% less than I do.  Those numbers don't lie.   In our case, the company (which is highly profitable) is demanding large concessions from its employees.  If your boss was making money hand over fist and one day he told you he wanted to pay you significantly less, how would you feel?  The simple fact is that unless you have the training, experience, and qualifications necessary, and actually hold a particular job, it's really hard for you to say what someone who does should be comfortable earning.  I don't know what you do, but I'll bet you think you should earn more, and chances are you deserve to.  I almost certainly can't do your job and/or don't want it...besides, I don't have that job, so my opinion on appropriate compensation would be completely meaningless.   When I was an uneducated, unskilled young man I worked at a non-union hotel as a maintenance guy for close to minimum wage.  I had few if any other options.  The company (at the time INCO) I now work for was on strike then as it is now.  I remember having absolutely no sympathy for those striking workers.  I thought that they already made many times what I made, and that they should be happy with that.  I even took some amount of selfish, spite-filled joy from knowing that these guys were stressed out and suffering from the kind of financial hardships that I did all the time.  the thought of them already being so much better off than me, but wanting even more made my blood boil.   The internet didn't exist back then, but if it did I would have even been so smug and bitter about the whole situation that I might have written ""lol"" at the end of a post I had written mocking their struggle.  I wouldn't have admitted to it then but I was jealous and bitter that I hadn't made other choices that would allow me to be a candidate for better job and a better life.  I know a lot of people dislike unions for a variety of reasons (or at least they tell themselves that they do) and a lot of those reasons are quite valid.  But I also know from experience that for at least some people, their feelings surrounding the whole issue stem from little more than a basic character flaw common to human nature called envy.  You told us what you thought about the stricking workers at Vale, so I thought I'd take a second and let you know what this stricking member thinks.  I did my best to remain respectful, and I think I did so.  You're entitled to your opinion, and I'm entitled to mine.  The big difference is that my opinion gets counted in the form of a vote on the contract and yours does not."

406604,Fishnwire,2009-11-29 14:51:00,983,"  You are exactly right, sir.  That's why I stated I was only saying ""what this stricking member thinks""."
406605,BUSTER,2009-11-29 15:02:00,1336,now since your off ...go fishing and post a report!!!  
406607,Fishnwire,2009-11-29 15:15:00,983,  I have to go work on my broken trailer so I can get my quad in the bush.  I hope to finish today.  Just waiting for my Father-in-law to finish his chores around his place and I'm going to meet him at my buddy's where the trailer is parked.  Don't worry...I got PLENTY of fishing in this summer.    Best season ever.
406623,ch312,2009-11-29 16:57:00,1590," i guess you really cant  i never have or will work at timmies or walmart, but that comment was totally uncalled for.    many years ago we actually needed unions to make jobs safer and to ensure people werent getting worked to death. now the only thing unions are good for is protecting lazy workers.  a large concrete company with 40+ employees that i use to work for went union after the workers voted for it. all they thought about was making more money. less than 2 years later they will be closing the business because of all the union Bull. the company had been making big profits for over 10 years and shared those profits by handing out big christmas bonuses, work clothes/boots, and having christmas parties were more than 100 people usually attended for all you can eat/drink."
406638,Whitespinnerbait,2009-11-29 18:28:00,2038," Not me , I wish they would open more of them ....  Put all those little stores out of buisness ..you know the ones that way way overcharge for everthing..."
406649,fishermccann,2009-11-29 19:22:00,655,"People just want to pay as little as they can for ""stuff"" even if it is crap!"
406666,walleyejigger,2009-11-29 20:24:00,876,"  very well said fishnwire, stand strong"
406680,ehg,2009-11-29 21:10:00,2666,Likewise.  Between Canadian Tire and Loblaws everything is available and better quality and cheaper. Whenever at Walmart felt like i was cattle being herded and exploited.
406697,misfish,2009-11-29 21:37:00,29133, TY
406701,Billy Bob,2009-11-29 21:45:00,5865, If this was true then they all would close in Canada........but I have a feeling Walmart will be open longer then both of them....
406743,Fishnwire,2009-11-29 22:58:00,983,"  I don't know who was the first person to come up with this line of thinking...you hear it over and over again.  If I had a dime for every time someone (who doesn't belong to one) has uttered the phrase ""unions have outlived their usefulness"" I wouldn't care about working for a living because I'd have all the money I'd ever need.  The simple and obvious fact is that unions are still needed (perhaps now more than ever) simply to maintain those gains have been fought for and earned by working people over the years.  This notion that companies would continue to pay union wages and maintain the kind of health and safety standards that don't exist outside of union shops should they not be forced to through collective bargaining is beyond naive.  If their feet weren't being held to the fire they'd like nothing more than for things to go back to being more like they were before unions existed."
406744,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-11-29 22:59:00,0,"questioning walmarts ethics is no better than questioning nikes. they have made their fortune on the backs of slave/child labour, part time workstaff, not paying benefits, and yes, keeping out the unions.  how are they going to hire all part timers and not pay benefits if the union gets involved?"
406746,Fishnwire,2009-11-29 23:03:00,983,  So if a Walmart sized business which competes with the company you work for (assuming one exists) came to your town you'd be eager to see your boss put out of business and you out of a job so your customers could get a better deal?  I am fairly certain your tune would change pretty quick.
406748,Guest gbfisher,2009-11-29 23:11:00,0,good on them....
406760,misfish,2009-11-29 23:26:00,29133," This sounds like something I have heard over and over again aswell,,,,,,,   Give me, give me,then when they want some back,,,,,,,,,,,, I think you get the pic here.   Whats the old saying,,,,,,,,  You made yer bed,now sleep in it.    As I have said many times,I have worked on bothsides.I,ll take the non, thanks.  We can argue about this til the cows come home.  Enough said."
406762,irishfield,2009-11-29 23:28:00,26272,Come on Brian.. tell the truth.. you just don't want the prices going up for shells in the hunting department! lol
406763,holdfast,2009-11-29 23:30:00,1813,"Walmarts put my wife to work and my two daughters.  They also put a couple of Disabled to work too. Theyre low prices also puts competition to the other retailers.  They might of put a few family businesses out of commission, but they sure higher more employees.  They also have a great fishing department.  They are the only store in this city that I can buy CDs and Music DVDs"
406764,misfish,2009-11-29 23:30:00,29133, I get my pop to make reloads.
406324,Billy Bob,2009-11-28 15:21:00,5865,"They organized a union in Quebec and Walmart just closed it's door.......good, bad or just ugly ?  ?  ?  http://www.buffalonews.com/145/story/875941.html"
406329,BillM,2009-11-28 16:25:00,17367,Didn't a Walmart shut down in Arizona recently?
406331,bigfish1965,2009-11-28 17:08:00,3382,I wish they would close all of them.
406341,Roy,2009-11-28 17:28:00,13728,"Well, in case anyone cares, I was cheering for Walmart in that particular incident."
406364,craigdritchie,2009-11-28 19:02:00,1586,"That seems familiar. Did Wal-Mart not shut down another store when the employees wanted to unionize? I seem to think that was last year or maybe the year before, and also in Quebec."
406369,Fishnwire,2009-11-28 19:15:00,983,"It's not like I've shopped there very much in the past, but I sure as heck WON'T be shopping there in the future.  If they had attempted to keep the location open but were not profitable because of the union, that would be one thing, but they didn't.  The thing is they knew that the location in question WOULD have remained profitable, so they shut it down to avoid setting that precedent.  The clear winner in this story is the Quebec town that has managed to rid itself of it's local Walmart.  I'd love to see the same exact thing happen here in Sudbury.  Even with their low prices on crappy merchandise, Walmart is not a net benefit to the communities it does business in.  Goggle the words ""Walmart"" + ""evil"" and learn a little about how they treat everyone they do business with.  Any person, organization or entity that gets in the way of Walmart's increased profitability is thoroughly destroyed.  They use their awesome power to leverage every possible cent they can from their employees, suppliers, and the very communities they operate in.  The way Walmart is run is a testament to human greed, and reminds us that for some people, enough is never enough."
406371,Terry,2009-11-28 19:19:00,14456,"well yeah but closing their  doors, is the only way to keep a union out and as long as they can open another one in that town then everyone got what they wanted"
406372,Roy,2009-11-28 19:20:00,13728,"hmmmm   That might have been the McDonalds debacle, Craig."
406375,danbouck,2009-11-28 19:33:00,4380,"If my place ever decided to join a union we would shut down instantly.  I like Walmart, it has kept me out of the poor house (somewhat)."
406377,Fishnwire,2009-11-28 19:33:00,983,I thought this was a new store closure.  It's just a decision handed down regarding a store closure in 2005.  I might be partially wrong then because the company is claiming that location was not profitable.  That claim seems somewhat dubious to me...I'm sure Walmart has creative accountants and lawyers on their payrole.  Who knows?
406383,Fishnwire,2009-11-28 19:47:00,983,"  At the mine I worked with a guy that had previously owned his own electrical contracting company.  His employees voted to go union and he did just what you are suggesting, he shut the business down immediately.  He absolutely refused to run a union shop, which he was totally within his right to do.  The funny thing is that after he did so, and needed a job himself, the first job he applied for was a job at INCO, which is unionized.  I couldn't help but wonder why he thought his employees didn't have the right belong to a union, but that it was OK for him."
406387,Whitespinnerbait,2009-11-28 19:56:00,2038,  Yeah did they ever teach Wal-mart a lesson ....  They put themselves out of a Job......   Kudos to Wal-Mart...
406391,Fishnwire,2009-11-28 20:03:00,983,"  I wasn't refering to the employees (sorry, I thought I'd made that clear) although they're probably better off working for who ever opens up to fill Walmart's void in that particular market.  I was refering to the town itself that no longer has a Walmart draining dollars away from its local economy."
406401,Billy Bob,2009-11-28 20:50:00,5865, I would have to say that is a safe assumption since the store is closed down.....
406406,JohnF,2009-11-28 21:49:00,3494,"The problem with this whole us 'n them thang between the pro-union and anti-union sectors is that in the end it's just like the politicians we love to hate - it smacks too much of what's best for the party and too little about what's best for everyone.  Okay, I'll admit up front I'm not a union sympathizer. I believe that back in the day the unions did a good thing for the downtrodden wage labourer but today it's come full circle to the point that unions have become the bullies and the only way to fight them is to keep them out of the shop. That's what Walmart is doing and I can't say I blame them. It's not out of the question that Walmart is a hardnosed employer but if the unions had used a little restraint and good judgment in the past in how they worked their end of the deal they might have kept the door open to being in all the shops that needed them. They've been guilty of overkill and it's costing the labourers of the world now.  Dunno what the answer is but the unions have screwed themselves. They're a dying breed, and that's a fact. Look around at how little sympathy they have outside of self pity.  Kinda like politicians today. Anyone here really feel a whole lotta love and trust for them any more?  JF"
406414,Bernie,2009-11-28 22:04:00,3190,"When I finished high school I went to work for Sears. 4 years in a warehouse getting in shape and making good bucks (for around here at the time anyway). Then got on driving transport for them for the next 6 years, it was a great job, benefits, decent pay and a future pension plan. But some dudes were disgruntled about some trivial stuff and started talking union. That was January 1985. We got the news in February, moving operations to Barrie guys, where do you want to go?, we are shutting North Bay down. It was pretty tough to take at the time but it all turned out a whole lot better for me anyway."
406418,Fishnwire,2009-11-28 22:27:00,983,  I thought it was obvious I meant all Walmarts...I don't even live in the town where this took place.

Well since you're a Wal-Mart hater, I guess you've never seen the people that work there... most of them couldn't work somewhere else. Tim Hortons can only employ soo many people in a town yanno.  As far as the Wal-Mart shoppers go, they'll just drive to the next closest town that has a Wal-Mart and shop there... taking their tax money with them!!!  Those union wannabe's really helped that town eh!"

Wal-Mart isn't just a shopping experience... it's a CULT!!!  ... as for the the people that don't like Wal-Mart, we'd appreciate it if you wouldn't shop there... it makes the checkout lines shorter... and we didn't want to shop with your nasty  anyway!!!"
406497,pikehunter,2009-11-29 02:07:00,1659,"Say what you will about unions. Sooner or later many of us will be working in a Walmart because that's the only jobs that will be left!  Working environment at that company is the pits. Low pay, crappy hours, lousy shifts and morons for managers (well some at least). Not only that but full time is considered 28 hours a week...not 40 as you would expect. This gives them the advantage of cutting back on hours in the fall of the year and after the Xmas season is said and done. They can still consider an employee full time so they can avoid many problems associated with cutting back.  Do Walmart employees need a union to stand up for their rights? I would say yes they do, if you disagree then go ahead, try working for them. I tried it for a month, full time too, got in a disagreement with an idiot manager who had her head stuck up in a cloud and told her to stick it. Just wasn't worth it. I did it for a change from what I had been doing figuring it would be interesting to explore and investigate the company from the inside and found I didn't care for it even though I had a lot of respect for the late Sam Walton and how he made his company the largest in the world but no body knows what anyone puts up with until you have walked a mile in their shoes. Too bad the union didn't win as it would certainly have looked good on Walmart."
