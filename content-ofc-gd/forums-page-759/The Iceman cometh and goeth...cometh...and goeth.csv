Usually its like clockwork........things start to chill off around mid September.......October is Fall.... 2nd week inNovember starts the minus temps with the gradual ice up happening and fishable ice by no later than the first week of December.  Not this year....   I keep taking pictures of what appears to be the start of ice up, only to have wind and plus temperatures disipate whatever ice formed the day before. Its actually started now, and i went to put my pictures in order to make up a post.....lol...was gonna be an impossible task.  The pics go back to 6th of November, and the dates from the camera are all jumbled up, but they were nice pictures so i thought i'd stick 'em together in no particular order with some music.  If nothing else its a nice tune for a Sunday morning.   "

406625,limeyangler,2009-11-29 17:01:00,5204,  I saw the first truck go across on the 12th last year......like you say Bushy....maybe a boat.
406628,Mike the Pike,2009-11-29 17:13:00,3421,I wish mother nature would get on with it. The transition period is so boring.At this rate we may have to take the boat out.
406717,Leecher,2009-11-29 22:20:00,7832,"Ohhh man.... I really thought I was going to see a first hard water report when I saw this thread Not disappointed one bit.... Cool video Simon     The hard stuff is coming, just a matter of time  Thanks for sharing Jacques"
406725,JohnF,2009-11-29 22:28:00,3494, Mebbe it's just me but somehow there's nothing Marleyesque about ice water.  But yer right. It's a nice tune. Is it Bob?  JF
406751,grt1,2009-11-29 23:15:00,638,"Yup it sure is a crazy year, I reviewed our records on when the bay we are on froze and since 1990 when we moved to Gullrock, the latest was Nov 27th.  I was going to toss a line in this afternoon and give it a try, but somehow a nap got in the way,,,go figure. we get a skim around the edges in the early morning and the wave action takes it out before noon.  Looks like it will be nip and take to get some really safe ice before christmas."
406791,limeyangler,2009-11-30 00:27:00,5204,  I dunno....dont get much cooler than Bob Marley in my opinion....lol
406794,JohnF,2009-11-30 00:33:00,3494," OK. Good, no, great answer.  JF"
