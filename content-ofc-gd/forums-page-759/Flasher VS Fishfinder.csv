406095,Uncle Buck,2009-11-27 16:14:00,1000," It's better for me... i like it more... i've taken my lcd sonar/flasher and i wasn't too impressed...  3 colors as opposed to way more....  interference/screen clutter...  I can screw up the screen on an lcd sonar/flasher with my marcum... by fishing to close...  i don't have that issue with my marcum...  it's personal preference again...  like i said, if i wanted year round use, i'd by an lcd sonar for ice fishing, i'll stick with my flasher..."
406108,Vanselena,2009-11-27 16:56:00,269,"This issue comes up every year.  For those that have a LCD unit and want an iceducer we can make them for any sonar unit. Send me a PM. Your cost will be $60 plus shipping. We will need to know make, model and what cone angle you want.  Matthew"
406110,pooch,2009-11-27 16:59:00,139,"Great info, thanks. I just purchased a Humminbird Ice 45, and I'm thinking of returning it. I like the idea of seeing what's passed by your bait when you weren't looking.  Anyone using a fish finder with GPS and maping chips? Any problems?"
406149,limeyangler,2009-11-27 19:02:00,5204, Oh....lol
406152,Vanselena,2009-11-27 19:09:00,269, It seems that flashers are the way to go for ice fishing but LCD is better for year round fishing. Now if you had a 600W RMS lcd unit then the marcum unit would be all screwed up since the power output is more then 2X. On that note if you want to fish alone then my suggestion is to get a 1000W RMS unit and you won't have to worry about anyone fishing anywhere near you...LOL
406160,Uncle Buck,2009-11-27 19:46:00,1000,i've fished next to humminbird 787 and have cause very noticable interference on their screen it's 4000W compared to my marcums 2000W
406163,Vanselena,2009-11-27 19:53:00,269,"  That's interesting because it means that either yours has greater then 2000W of power or the Humminbird is less then 4000W of power. At 4000W the element would have to be 2"" because a 1"" element could not handle that kind of power at least not for long. If the humminbird has a 18 degree cone then it cannot be 4000W of power. You may have opened up a can of worms here."
406164,Roy,2009-11-27 19:59:00,13728,"It's all becoming clear here. I have an 8,000 watt unit which explains why I often have military aircraft above me when I'm fishing."
406166,Vanselena,2009-11-27 20:04:00,269,"I just checked the specs on a 787 and they show the cone angle at -10db which is way outside of the industry standard of -3db. In other words they are trying to make their fishfinder appear to have a wider cone angle, very suspect. It is likely the 4000 Watts P2P is on the 83khz and not the 200khz side. So given this information I could see how a marcum would mess with this humminbird unit."
406168,Vanselena,2009-11-27 20:06:00,269, :lol:
406241,limeyangler,2009-11-28 00:17:00,5204,my unit says its 800w....i started tying my flouro leaders straight to the mainline braid because i was picking up the micro swivel at depths upto 80'.....might have picked it up at deeper depthsa but i dont fish anywhere that deep (yet).
406624,mbosh1980,2009-11-29 17:00:00,349,"  ok, i finally found a video that showed me how the flasher models work.  Its a bit long, but around 6 mins in is a good display of seeing fish actually come up and hit a jig."
405450,basketclam,2009-11-25 18:03:00,115,"I've got a question that may seem basic to some.  What's the difference between a flasher and a fish finder?  I don't have a whole lot of experience with either, but I am more familiar with fish finders.  As near as I can tell, a fishfinder has some sort of LCD type display that identifies depth and suspended objects, sometimes may have temperature or other functions included whereas a flasher just looks like a round dial.  How the heck does it work?  Is a flasher specifically for ice fishing?  What are the advantages of one over another?  Any constructive feedback would be appreciated."
405454,mbosh1980,2009-11-25 18:17:00,349,"I'll go ahead and second this... It will be my first season ice fishing (yay zone 17!), and I'm trying to absorb as much info as possible before jan 1. I suppose I could just use the google button on the old interweb machine, but where is the fun in that!"
405458,wallyboss,2009-11-25 18:32:00,1095,Lots of info in this link  http://vexilar.com/pages/support/support_tips.html  What I like the best about my flasher is that it is real time no delay.  The cold weather doesn't affect it at all.  You might have a lot of arguments on this thread.  Because it's like   Ford or GM???    So once you make up your mind on a Flasher you'll have to ask  Vex or Marcuum.  I say VEX all the way.   On my boat my sonar in teh bow is setup on the flasher mode.  By the way if somebody tells you that he has a flasher and he shows up looking like this I wouldn't invite him to sit in a shack with you. 
405459,Hud,2009-11-25 18:37:00,140,What are good intro models of Vex for ice fishing?
405464,lpu_ofn,2009-11-25 18:53:00,29,"Personally, I like Fishfinder which can be set to flasher mode too"
405469,wallyboss,2009-11-25 19:19:00,1095,Fl-8 is a good starter one but if you fish for walleyes a lot you would want the FL-18 which as a zoom for bottom separation.   But if I had the money I would upgrade to an FL-20 today.
405484,Hud,2009-11-25 20:21:00,140,sweet thanks Wallyboss
405492,limeyangler,2009-11-25 20:42:00,5204,"  This suggests that LCD units have some kind of lag due to cold weather....ive been out in -25 without my shelter and i'm telling you all....there is no lag on my fish finder....the screen did not freeze and break.....Ive fished side by side with a vex and no interference.....I have posted numerous videos of my Lowrance x67c in action if ya dont believe me...lol....too many myths perpetuated about flashers v. lcd fishfinders usually at the expense of LCD fishfinders as a tool on the ice by folks who use flashers.  At the end of the day have a look at both, they will both put more fish on the ice for you...i like my LCD because i use it in graph mode...it has a flasher mode....but i prefer the graph mode. I can zoom in on any part of the water column, have split screen zoom mode...lots of stuff...flashers now also have these features. What i really like about my lcd fishfinder is i use it as my main fishfinder on the boat as well.....so for $ 360 i have a summer and winter outfit....i'm happy with that."
405499,Jet,2009-11-25 21:09:00,364,"As Limeyangler said, I've also fished in minus 25 weather with my Humminbird 343C with no freezing problems and no lag, confirmed by instant hits as I've hooked numerous Lakers chasing or coasting along the bottom and slamming my lures. My finder also has a flasher mode, but I also prefer the graph with live vertical flasher on the side. Gives me the benefits of both devices and its nice to see past readings if a fish moves out of range.  Its portability is also an added bonus for those who would like/need a finder for the boat, especially if you like to rent or can borrow a boat."
405502,LeXXington,2009-11-25 21:14:00,1928,I use my LCD without issues. I wish it had a little more power for the depth but all good for me.
405509,irishfield,2009-11-25 21:53:00,26272,Finder all the way. No issues.. -34C and great to walk back and see that a huge hook just went through to get you paying attention..or the fact a fish came up to look at your bait. Flasher.. you have to stare at it all day and watch the coloured blips.  
405514,camillj,2009-11-25 22:19:00,1988,I'm with Wayne et al ... since I normally am running around tending half a dozen lines for my not-so-keen 'guests' I am happy to swing past the lcd and see what I missed ... besides I am never really sure what I think I saw on the flasher

405575,Fishnwire,2009-11-26 01:35:00,983,"The one problem I have with using my finder through the ice is that I my transducer is bullet shaped (made to troll) and getting it to point straight down is not as easy as transducers that are designed to point straight down.  I'd be interested in hearing what you fellow ice-finder users do to combat this problem.  Secondly, last week I was fishing for crappie off my the docks of a marina on the French.  I was using my Humminbird 565 (it has a real-time sidebar) and was not picking up the fish these other guys with those ""Showdown"" LCD flashers were.  Also, even with the sensitivity turned all the way up, I couldn't always see my little crappie jig.  This might be because my transducer wasn't properly alinged...I just don't know"
405593,limeyangler,2009-11-26 02:17:00,5204,"It sounds absolutely like a transducer issue. I got my fishfinder around February time 2 years ago....needless to say they were out of ice transducers that late in the season.  They put one on order and i just went home with the unit that came with the bullet style transom mount  skimmer that is very similar to yours. I still used that one till the ice ducer arrived....i bought a $6 kids goalie stick at CT.....cut the blade off so i just had the aluminum handle with the wide part of the stick to mount the transducer bracket on.  I lined up the bottom of the trans ducer with the bottom edge of the stick exactly as you would with the bottom of your boat hull, drilled holes in the aluminum stick part....inserted a 14 inch bolt screw thing i found knocking around in one of my cupboards and attached 2 old 4oz sea fishishing sinkers where the aluminum met the wide part of the goalie stick, the weights helped to level the stick out as it was half plastic so would float off centre...then would lose signal.  When i got the ice transducer 3 weeks later i had the chance to use it still and could tell no difference between my hocky stick contraption and the new self weighted and centering iceducer, the only difference being the portability of the latter.....lol...also got far fewer strange looks with the icetducer than with the sawn off hockey stick out on the ice.  Whilst the hockey stick and other variations on that method work great....its really nice to have an ice transducer..less bulky awkward, stores easy, less space etc......Humming bird do an ice transducer for your model......click this link fishingwire and check it out.   HUMMINGBIRD ICE TRANSDUCER FOR A 565 UNIT"
405603,basketclam,2009-11-26 02:29:00,115,"Thanks for all the feedback guys.  Looks like the general consensus is that I can get a fishfinder that does everything a flasher does.  Maybe not as well, but close to it.  And I may have to fiddle around to get the transducer set right.  Do they make anything with an interchangable transducer, one for looking straight down through the ice and one for trolling?"
405607,Raf,2009-11-26 02:34:00,3495,"fishnwire, a regular transducer will work just fine.  align it the same way you would in a boat.. flat or parallel to the water. it ""sends"" the signal out the bottom of the flat part.    i can usually see a tiny jig in 80' of water with my eagle fishmark 320 and get frustrated by the lakers coming up to take a look at the bait then falling back down.  (yes another vote for fishfinder)"
405615,Fishnwire,2009-11-26 02:48:00,983,"limeyangler and Raf...thanks for your feedback.  I don't mean to hijack the thread...but the info you are giving is probably equally useful to the original poster.  If not I apologize.  I have a similar setup to the hockey stick, and I know how to align the transducer, but ensuring it is pointing straight down is tricky because it is made of wood and tends to float a bit.  I'll try adding weights to get it straighter.  Does the transducer have to be below the bottom of the ice, or can it be located part way down the hole?  How much was the ""iceducer""?"

I also used it for ice fishing last winter and it thrived in temps so cold I could barely keep the hole from freezing...in a portable hut.  I decided to purchase an ice tranducer this past week so that I could mount the regular transducer in the hull of my kayak.  This model also includes the flasher option, but I haven't been able to get comfortable with it."
