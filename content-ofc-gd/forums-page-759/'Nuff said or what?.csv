406461,Radnine,2009-11-29 00:40:00,1538,  This justifies the cost of the boat and the TV. Jim
406463,Leecher,2009-11-29 00:41:00,7832,Right on Jim I think you got yourself a serious fishing partner Leechman
406464,Terry,2009-11-29 00:45:00,14456,yup life is good
406468,irishfield,2009-11-29 01:01:00,26272,Yep.. Like Terry says.. Life is good !  I still have some of those from my kids (now 22/25/27)... ranging from the old cars to airplane rides. Hard to throw that stuff out...
406469,misfish,2009-11-29 01:01:00,29133,Nothing better then being told yer loved Jim. Very nice.  Why is the page split?
406470,vinnimon,2009-11-29 01:07:00,2593,"Cheers to you jim,I receive the same from my two girls all the time.My oldest received an A plus on the fathers day outing trolling for pickerel an at school project for fathers day.I was skunked and she nailed one.My good luck charm.At binbrook ice derby ,she had third place and dead center on the photo,for that ice tourney 2 years ago."
406480,Joey,2009-11-29 01:33:00,9122,Classic  Now just get him into porshe's and you can justify that too
406481,Twocoda,2009-11-29 01:35:00,4130,it may justify the boat and tv...but they pale in comparison to the justification of being a Dad....and that is worth a hell of alot more then a boat and tv but the rewards are priceless...  Keep the drawings for when he going to be a father...   you must be bass fishing cause i dont see any downriggers
406482,uglyfish,2009-11-29 01:37:00,981,"haha, thats awesome"
406513,bigugli,2009-11-29 03:18:00,6138,That's a wonderful image to see.  Just don't ruin him for life and teach him to be a Leafs fan
406540,splashhopper,2009-11-29 04:20:00,2931,you should send that to media departments at:  Crestliner  and  The NHL
406545,BassAsin,2009-11-29 04:35:00,806,"great to see Jim, enjoy it now cuz we grow up quick."
406566,Jonny,2009-11-29 06:15:00,1380,"Good stuff!  Besides the obvious feel-good value, it's always interesting to see what details kids pick up on.  I have a few drawings like that from when my boys were small, and I treasure them."
406587,TroutnMuskieHunter,2009-11-29 13:12:00,1362,Ya gotta love it Jim!!....kids are awesome!!
406613,limeyangler,2009-11-29 16:00:00,5204,Wow!  Kids are sooooo sweet!  Thanks for sharing that with us
406917,Fishnwire,2009-11-30 03:30:00,983,When I get stuff like that from my kids is makes me somewhat regret how horribly I have abused and neglected them over the years.  Just joking...I don't even have kids.  All kidding aside...that's totally awesome.  It makes me wish I had someone to draw pictures of me.
407002,LucG,2009-11-30 16:35:00,779,I love it how he specified it was a Crestliner with a 60 hp motor. (Y)
407158,T Fisher,2009-12-01 00:10:00,139,That's a great picture it brings back many memories of my little Girl and Son that are now 22 & 20 priceless.
407206,backbay,2009-12-01 02:46:00,773,"That's great! Keep it around, I bet you'll never get tired of looking at it."
407207,TJQ,2009-12-01 02:50:00,7806,Thats really nice!
