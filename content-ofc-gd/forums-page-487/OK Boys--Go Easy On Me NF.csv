623197,mercman,2011-09-20 19:39:00,7054,Its cute as a button Well done Bud !!! I Love the old tree.I find bare trees have so much more character than trees full of leaves.I often use them in my digital art to create atmosphere.

623826,Beans,2011-09-22 15:00:00,3339, You would probably like these two water colors and painting by a friend of ours Ruth Mudge...the water colors were a wedding gift and I purchased the painting as it reminded me of our old barn at Lake Scugog where I spent my boyhood summers...      I like your painting Bushart...well done...
