622883,ckrb2007,2011-09-19 18:54:00,449,Raising a beer to yet another season of disappointment.
622887,asdve23rveavwa,2011-09-19 19:03:00,2690,And so it begins..........
622890,manitoubass2,2011-09-19 19:07:00,11391," Hey, it's a good reason to have a few more beers     "
622891,bushart,2011-09-19 19:08:00,2628,Oh---it's so on
622895,manitoubass2,2011-09-19 19:14:00,11391,"Reimer won't play until the regular season starts. The management knows that if he were to play, he'd take a slap shot off the foot and miss the season with a severely sprained baby toe .  At least this way he won't get injured until the second or third week of the season"

622940,lookinforwalleye,2011-09-19 21:17:00,4399,"Somehow it seems too early to be talking hockey, I just hope the leafs have a nice even start in the first 10 games, 5-5 or 6-4. don`t want to see a 2-8 or a 1-9 as we will have our members jumping off the bloor viaduct, as long as they loose the first against the habs all is good!"

623036,Rod Caster,2011-09-20 01:06:00,5784, My sentiments exactly; except the leafs part. Go Phx and to a lesser extent the  Jets.

623055,danc,2011-09-20 02:14:00,4677,My buddy Dion phoned me this afternoon and told me that he was wayyyy pumped about the game tonight. I told him that I was busy and to get lost and to call back next week or so.
