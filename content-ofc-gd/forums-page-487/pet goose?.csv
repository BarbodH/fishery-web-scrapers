623895,Miracon,2011-09-22 17:11:00,200, LMAO!  C'Mon Guys...He's family now!!!!

623905,irishfield,2011-09-22 17:24:00,26272,This would be his smoking buddy...
623910,Grimace,2011-09-22 17:38:00,2020,I have not read this thread except the original post.   I would lead it into my old lady's closet.   As I am watching TV I would have a warm smile when I hear her shrieking.  Lol.  But that's just me.
623913,Miracon,2011-09-22 17:43:00,200, MAN...you guys are a tough crowd!!!! Haha!

623922,capt bruce,2011-09-22 18:22:00,820,"It goes without saying that the Big Sittin' Goose Decoy Blind, a product that we are hopeing to market soon, is designed for hunters.I think you will be able to make one out of this  situation The hunter reclines in a sort of beach chair, then pulls the giant goose body down over his face, making himself virtually invisible, except for the fact that his arms and legs and gun are clearly sticking out. The idea is that when geese fly overhead, they look down and think: Hey! There's a person down there engaging in an act of perversion with a giant goose! Naturally the geese want to fly down and take a closer look. Anybody would. Just a thought , you lie down goose on head and all goose hunters here that show up get their limits , win win , at least for the hunters and the goose , sorry about you tho ."
623924,mercman,2011-09-22 18:29:00,7054," Mercman. ....i have his address.Just google mapped him and the Goose is sitting beside his driveway right now.LH side, near the Butt pile"

623935,capt bruce,2011-09-22 18:59:00,820,Speaking of geese or is it gooses. A little something my old dad taught me .  what can a goose do that a duck can't and a lawyer should?    Stick his/her bill up their ass
623972,Rattletrap2,2011-09-22 20:41:00,1652," Does anyone recall a number of years back when the City of Toronto slaughtered something like 2,000 Canada Geese along the waterfront in their idea to feed the homeless and clean up their waterfront? Only after they had 2,000 dead geese on their hands, did someone decide to test the meat! It was found to be unfit for human consumption! These are not migratory birds that feed on grains. They eat crap along the waterfront and reside here all year round. Their food and water sources are polluted."
623983,GBW,2011-09-22 21:11:00,8460,I'm not near the water front or down town TO.

624000,Rod Caster,2011-09-22 22:01:00,5784, I had a great laugh at that photo! I guess nobody heard me
624004,GBW,2011-09-22 22:11:00,8460,Oh I did too LOL at the pic's.  But I didn't want to keep bringing the post back to the top.
624092,Sinker,2011-09-23 04:17:00,8692," Interesting. I've looked and looked, but can't find anything about this. Do you have a link or anything??  S."
623679,fishing,2011-09-22 01:22:00,167,Geese behave like dogs. They can differentiate people from each other. They can tell friends from  strangers. I believe that the goose likes your family members and she thinks that you are all nice.
623682,ccmtcanada,2011-09-22 01:28:00,7971, Time to get it a bed for it GBW!!!!
623695,Roy,2011-09-22 02:08:00,13728, Good idea. He might not like goose down though.
623702,GBW,2011-09-22 02:48:00,8460,gone for a smoke and no bird!  going again in a few then bed so who knows if it will show up...
623703,GBW,2011-09-22 02:49:00,8460,That's it!  I'm going to bring it to BOQ and stick it in your room!  AHAHAHAH
623705,irishfield,2011-09-22 02:54:00,26272," Well Geoff.. you seem to be out there having a smoke on a constant basis, maybe he's only out for a smoke after sex !"
623713,Rattletrap2,2011-09-22 03:29:00,1652," Yep, 4 pounds of crap, per bird, per day! The kids will love playing in the yard! NOT!"
623715,GBW,2011-09-22 03:36:00,8460,maybe that's whay it's out hanging with me.  I can only do so much in a day...
623718,Miracon,2011-09-22 03:51:00,200,"OK...this is NOT from me (I'm on the ""pet"" side! Haha!)!! Rob (worse half) told me I have to add this to the other recipes being offered...  BEST Goose Recipe EVER!  Marinade the goose in wine (minimum overnight) Put it on a cedar plank. Put it in your oven at 450 degrees. When its done, take the goose out. Throw it in the garbage, and eat the cedar plank. Best timber you ever tasted!"
623748,jbailey,2011-09-22 11:46:00,866," interesting, i currently do storm water sampling in toronto"
623768,GBW,2011-09-22 12:35:00,8460,"no goose at all yesterday, woohoo!"
623774,Miracon,2011-09-22 12:42:00,200, I'm actually kinda sad about that!!! Wanted to see more pics of him!  Haha!
623775,GBW,2011-09-22 12:45:00,8460,"with my luck, it's there now honking for me to come out."
623779,Harrison,2011-09-22 13:02:00,2202, beauty.
623832,Sinker,2011-09-22 15:13:00,8692,"Was it healthy? I mean, could it fly? Early goose season was last week....maybe it was injured? It could have very well lost its mate, and now doesn't know what to do with itself, but any good goose hunter would call that one right back and drop it beside its mate for good  Just sayin....  S."
623836,GBW,2011-09-22 15:19:00,8460,"it was/is healthy and it can fly.  feel free to come and geeeet it next week when the season opens again...  PS, I think I'm in the no gun zone of Whitby..."
623840,solopaddler,2011-09-22 15:23:00,8605,"Just as an aside to this topic, are there any restrictions or guidlines on eating local waterfowl like there are for fish?  Something like a hunters version of The Guide To Eating Sportfish?  I can only imagine how gross and toxic a lot of these urban geese are."
623841,Sinker,2011-09-22 15:24:00,8692,"yeah, you are. I've had a few run ins with the DRP hunting around Brooklin. Most of those guys don't even know the discharge by-laws. One morning we had 5 cruisers roll out into our field with guns drawn   I will never understand what they were thinking that morning!!! They left quick once I pulled out the discharge by law though!!  S."
623844,capt bruce,2011-09-22 15:33:00,820,"PM me we probably know alot of people in common , Im old now and dont get out in the field anymore , You work for city or consultants ? I looked at your pic and I dont think I have seen you around  but the pic is not to clear for these old eyes , anyway PM me , its a small world hope Im not your boss lol."
623847,Harrison,2011-09-22 15:36:00,2202," Similair experience, we were called out of the field once and as we walked up to them in Camo, with shot guns, 2 labs and a spread of 100 plus decoys they asked us these exact words.  ""What are you doing?""  Those who know me, know I couldn't let that go.  So I responded.  ""This is a classified training exercise, we are readying our Canadian geese for when they enter the US fly zone""  After laughing they checked us out and ruined our hunt.  ""what are you doing""  I mean seriously."
623848,Sinker,2011-09-22 15:38:00,8692," Not that I know of, Mike.  Why would you think they are gross and toxic? They feed on grain for most of thier lives, shouldn't be too much toxic material in there for them to ingest.  I could see it in diver ducks that are gorging on zebra mussels though.  I grind 'em and make pepperettes with most of my geese. Ducks I do the same with some of them, but I like to pluck the nice ones and roast them whole.  I'm still fine after a lifetime of eating them, so they must be ok?  S."
623873,GBW,2011-09-22 16:32:00,8460,If it's back any time soon I'll see if it will follow me into the back yard for safe keeping...
623881,ketchenany,2011-09-22 16:48:00,3229, GBW doesn't need anymore wood
623882,Miracon,2011-09-22 16:49:00,200,"Geoff, the backyard idea is great! Listening to everyone else on here, I'd be concerned about anyone who knows where ya live!!!"
623885,GBW,2011-09-22 16:56:00,8460,"yup, walleyejack.  Any anyone of them is more then welcome to the goose."
623436,GBW,2011-09-21 14:26:00,8460,"Hey all.  So Monday night I go out to my garage for a smoke and as I'm standing there watching tv I hear a honk.  I look down and there is a goose right beside me like he'she's begging for food like a pet.  I look around and open the green bin and give it some lettuce, it wasn't interested in it.  This thing was so interested in what I was doing it let me pet it.  So I get it out of the garage, close the door and head off to bed.  The next morning (yesterday morning) it's out there and decides it's going to follow my wife and her friend as they go for the morning run.  It flew out in front of them, then landed and waited for them to catch up and it did this over and over.  So, last night I'm walking dog and we happen to walk by the goose (I didn't see it at first) and it decides to follow us home.  So I let my dog check it out on the driveway.    After a few min. of that the dog lost interest (to bad I didn't get the start of them playing in the vid).  So it decided it was going to sit down and have a rest.   Then it decided I was too far away from it so it came up to me in the garage (again!).   After getting it out of the garage the Mrs and kids came home and decided to check it it out too.   Now how do I get rid of this goose?  It's been in and around the area for almost two weeks now I've been told."
623449,solopaddler,2011-09-21 14:37:00,8605,It's obviously imprinted on you and needs guidance.  Hop in your car and head for California.
623452,Rod Caster,2011-09-21 14:41:00,5784,  Put some grains in the oven and open the door.
623464,GBW,2011-09-21 15:05:00,8460,"I bet it would!  It was standing on the steps in the garage waiting for me at the door when I ran in to get something.  hummmm, roast goose..."
623466,NAW,2011-09-21 15:11:00,4022,Looks blinded in one eye.  Maybe it's just the camera angle.  Geese are weird like that eh.  I don't know how to get ride of it.  You could train your dog to attack it every time it comes on your lawn.
623470,TennesseeGuy,2011-09-21 15:24:00,957,Since it's alone it may have recently lost it's mate.  Tough time for a goose.
623471,highdrifter,2011-09-21 15:25:00,2534, HAHAH!!
623472,northernpike56,2011-09-21 15:25:00,717,are you allowed to kill them in ontario? ive had problems with them as well...

He had a farm outside port perry . They would stay with him in his pond untill they were big enough to fly away , some would return now and than but they returned to the wild (if you can call a gooses life in the big smoke wild )but was funny to see these birds following him around in his yard we used to call him Father goose ."

623511,TennesseeGuy,2011-09-21 16:50:00,957,Geese keep weeds out of your garden.  They cause a problem with young corn since they think it's a weed.  I'd like having a goose for my garden and a goat for my lawn.
623549,mercman,2011-09-21 18:42:00,7054,  Ya silly Goose .........
623550,ketchenany,2011-09-21 18:42:00,3229,"Problem solved  I'm out there October 7th to help my daughter move just in case!  *  (10-pound) goose, cleaned and trimmed with innards removed * Sea salt * 1 orange, quartered * 1 lemon, quartered * 1 apple, cored and quartered * 2 tablespoons goose fat * 1/2 cup scallions * 2 tablespoons grated ginger * 2 cups blackberries * 1 tablespoon sugar * 1 tablespoon soy sauce * 2 cups Zinfandel * 2 cups chicken stock  Directions  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Wash the goose thoroughly inside and out. Dry well with paper towels. Prick the skin with a fork or fine skewer (this helps release the fat during cooking) and generously rub all over with sea salt. Stuff the bird with the cut fruit. Tuck the wings under so they are not exposed. Add 1/2 inch water to the roasting pan and position the goose breast side down in a roasting rack. Place the pan in the oven for 45 minutes. Check the bird while it's roasting to make sure the water doesn't evaporate or the goose fat will burn. After 45 minutes, take the goose out of the oven. Turn it breast side up and prick the skin again. Carefully remove the excess fat by tilting the pan and using a baster. Add another 1/2-inch of water to the pan. Continue to roast for another 2 hours.  The goose is cooked when its juices run clear when the thigh is pierced with a skewer. If they are at all bloody, roast for a further 15 minutes and check again. To be sure the goose is cooked, insert a thermometer in the thickest part of the thigh. It should read 170 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer. Remove from the oven and let it rest for 15 minutes.  Pour out excess fat leaving about 2 tablespoons. Add the scallions, ginger, blackberries, sugar and soy sauce. Saute for 5 to 10 minutes until the blackberries begin to break up and the juices are released. Add Zinfandel and reduce by half then add the chicken stock and reduce by half again. Pass sauce through a sieve and discard the pulp. Serve with the goose."
