623258,Rich,2011-09-21 00:11:00,3927,"10 days left in the season to enjoy the inland versions of the salmonoids everyone is after! I much prefer a quiet afternoon on a lazy river, looking for residents than the shoulder-to-shoulder, litter, snag, argument, rudeness fest that is steelheading.  Anywho, if you're gonna go after the inland fish.. don't forget the white spinnerbaits. ;-)  "
623262,rocheleauc,2011-09-21 00:17:00,205,great pic!
623269,ChrisK,2011-09-21 01:07:00,2772,That right there is one sweet looking trout and on a spinnerbait to boot !!
623389,johnnyb,2011-09-21 12:44:00,3413,"Methinks I've seen that background many times over in your reports this time of year   Nice work, once again"
623428,asdve23rveavwa,2011-09-21 14:12:00,2690,"Beautiful brownie Rich!!!  Good point on lure choice, and, thinking outside the box. As far as your steelheading comment...that is why I stay away from most of the more popular locations.  Rather hook half (or less) as many fish, but, enjoy it 10 X more.  For that matter, I find myself fishing for them off certain less crowded piers as much as I do in rivers the last ten years."
623442,Leecher,2011-09-21 14:30:00,7832,Nice one Rich Those spinnerbaits are phenomenal
623455,LucG,2011-09-21 14:47:00,779,I would have NEVER though about using a spinnerbait on trout!!!!
623478,fishindevil,2011-09-21 15:31:00,6254,nice brown rich !!! cheers man
623486,bushart,2011-09-21 15:39:00,2628,Nice Rich  Your lucky havin Browns around--I never had thrown a spinnerbait either  Hear ya on the insanity they call steelheadin---I think they need to calm down and have a beer or somethin
623488,eman,2011-09-21 15:46:00,101,white spinner - never would have tossed that. Maybe an inline Bluefox
623807,Rich,2011-09-22 14:23:00,3927,"Honestly, my arsenal for browns has changed so drastically since I started as a kid. My go-to used to be a 1/8th oz 5 diamonds spoon. I don't even own one anymore. Small spinnerbaits (Mini-Kings), 2 1/2"" jerkbaits (Rebels), Crappie senkos, Gulp Minnows, gobies & angleworms (for specks) and 3"" white grubs are my whole tackle supply for trout now. Jerkbaits are my fav way to fish 'em, more of a summertime bait though. This time of year the quick moving baits in the runs seems to be the most productive method.  And if nothing works, drift a live chub minnow under a float in the deep holes, hold on tight.  Thanks for the comments everyone!"
623823,cuzza,2011-09-22 14:57:00,467, I was thinking the same thing but they hit big rabbit strip streamers which have the same pulsing action so I it makes sense (I'm a non-elitist anything goes including flies fisherman ). Will have to get some of the smaller ones and give em a go. Nice fish and a nice looking spot Rich  As for steelhead - like Frankie I avoid the crowds which normally just involves a bit of a walk
