623639,Fang,2011-09-21 23:52:00,1330,The wife and I were driving around last weekend and went by Direct Buy in mississauga. Decided to check it out as we are doing a basement reno. Had to schedule a one on one visit before being allowed to see any of the goods. Right there it started to smell fishy. Well tonight I get a full on pressure phone call to set a time to come in and go through an hour and a half orientation THAT WILL SAVE ME HUNDREDS OF $. After being interrupted several times telling her I'm too busy to spend a whole evening without any evidence of their pricing offer she basically insults me for not being smart enough to realize what a great deal I'm missing. Boy I really want to call back and book my appointment. What a great sales pitch! I wonder if I could sign up for a time share with them
623643,coreyhkh,2011-09-21 23:59:00,163,Dont its a scam and you end up paying more.  Cbc did a story on it http://www.cbc.ca/marketplace/2009/the_price_cut_promise/main.html
623645,Terry,2011-09-22 00:00:00,14456,it is high pressure sale to get you to buy their membership...... I signed up to try the key to win contest they often had..then I found out I had to sit through the very lone sale pitch.....NOT so I don't know......much about them
623711,Rattletrap2,2011-09-22 03:20:00,1652,"RUN Forest, Run!  I don't have personal experience with them other than one similar to what you experienced! I wouldn't let it go any further than that one annoying conversation I had with them on the phone."
623712,Miracon,2011-09-22 03:26:00,200,My Brother-in-law has a membership. He says he would never do it again but has gotten some great deals in the meantime. I will get more information from him for you in the morning.
623720,ctranter,2011-09-22 03:54:00,543,"If it looks, smells, feels fishy.... it probably is.  Your intuition is your best friend."
623746,Fish4Eyes,2011-09-22 11:44:00,1022,What exactly are you doing to your basement?
623753,smally21,2011-09-22 11:55:00,993,"i get a kick out of their adds  We bought this 30$ tile for 21$ from direct buy! - meanwhile its 8$ at the home depot.  direct buy justs starts out with enormous price tags, knocks 'em down and makes you think its a deal. don't let you 'share' your membership with anyone else. membership fee is ridiculous.  many ways to get better deals."
623785,206,2011-09-22 13:24:00,563,The wife and I were invited to the open house....after the speaches and video presentations i thought i was in!  Then came the price  the basic membership was like $1500 and that only gave you limited access to a few manufactures they deal with....the more you pay the more catalogs you can shop from.  We walked out...I have a hard time paying costco the 65 dollar membership
623792,Oryx,2011-09-22 13:41:00,186,"  Direct Buy bases their price upon the Manufacturers list price. I know this as I am a purchaser for a large plumbing supply wholesaler and Direct buy is a customer of ours.  Personally, I would not buy anything from them.  A smart and savvy shopper should be able to get close to the same deal by negotiating with showrooms and direct distributors of the product."
623809,ricoboxing,2011-09-22 14:24:00,398,"my sister and brother in law have a membership, so if i ever feel like buying over priced furniture or appliances, i will just buy it through them."
623812,Miracon,2011-09-22 14:34:00,200,"I just talked to my Brother-in-Law with the membership. He said he wouldn't do it again but has got some great deals and some not so great. He says it's really only good for people who have a lot of renovating to do and furniture to buy. Otherwise, he doesn't feel it's worth it and won't be renewing."
623821,motion,2011-09-22 14:49:00,403,It's a scam. Run..............
624014,lplp,2011-09-22 23:06:00,83,"Reminds me of the time we were in puerta platta ,, and we got suckered in for condo seminar, after awhile the guy realized we were there for the free booze they were offering and came up to us and said ,you guys are just here for the free bottles of rum arent you,, we said yes ,he gave us our bottles and said goodbye ,we said thanks and what time tomorrow."
624019,Billy Bob,2011-09-22 23:17:00,5865,Did a time share presentation near Disney years ago....had a great breakfast there and then came the Bull...he kept telling me how great the golf course was going to be when finished.....he asked if I golfed...I said no but I hunt and fish....I said the lake didn't look big enough to fish in but I would love to shoot some of the waterfowl in there....he couldn't accomidate my wishes so he let us go with some FREE (my favorite 4 letter word) Universal Studious tickets...  ...lesson learned...don't invite a Redneck to a time share presentation...
624025,pikehunter,2011-09-22 23:33:00,1659,"Take all the previous advise seriously.  Used to work for a window and door company who was one of their suppliers. A scam indeed! The membership fee is in the thousands! And is not a lifetime membership either, the membership fee alone is enough to renovate a bathroom. At least my bathroom, and I'd have money left over for a small holiday."
