623138,NAW,2011-09-20 14:26:00,4022,"My hunting partner and I hit our blind early Saturday morning for the opening day in our area.  Woke up at 4, in the boat by 4:30, at the blind by 5, flipped the canoe at 5:30. Blasting birds at 6:30, limited out by 8.  The first flock that came in was 5 strong.  My hunting partner dropped 3, and I hit the other 2.  Great start to the morning.  Half way to the limit, and we've only fired 5 shots!  We ended the day with 8 woodies, 1 mallard, 2 teel, and 1 accidental mud hen (not picture worthy)    Hope nobody gets offended seeing some pictures of daffy all shot up..       The birds were FULL of pin feathers, so we ended up skinning most of them.   "
623141,LucG,2011-09-20 14:35:00,779,"Nice shooting and good eats! I'm an avid grouse hunter, but I havent tried waterfowl YET. Thanks for sharing!"
623143,Roy,2011-09-20 14:36:00,13728,"You guys did good, Nick. I know that spot."
623147,misfish,2011-09-20 14:50:00,29133,"  Nice shoot,n bud. It,s those cold morning and a warm barrel that gets your blood flowing."
623149,mike rousseau,2011-09-20 15:00:00,4661,Nice shooting fellas...  Those ducks look tasty...  My brother pounds ducks around here... Can't wait for the duck peperettes....
623252,Terry,2011-09-20 23:51:00,14456,"nice going     which spot,...the BBQ........LOL"
623254,misfish,2011-09-21 00:02:00,29133,"Never tried them on the BBQ Nick,sure look good.  I always skin my fowl weather it be ducks or geese.Wrap in bacon and throw them in the oven. Geese come out like a good roast of beef,ducks taste the same. Going to give the BBQ a try for sure."
623267,NAW,2011-09-21 00:52:00,4022,"Duck is excellent on the grill.  Skin or no, they taste great both ways.  With no skin, I just keep basting them in BBQ sauce.  My geese I cook two ways.  Slow cooker, with lots of sauce and a few slices of orange.  Once their done, you pull them apart just like pulled pork, and make a sloppy Joe, or wraps.  The other good way is to make jerky out of them, as long as you cut 90Â° to the grain.  Oh man, my mouth is starting to water..  Can't wait till Saturday to do it all over again"
623268,Billy Bob,2011-09-21 01:00:00,5865,Looks like all young birds....but SWEET.......  Our season doesn't start for over a month from now....
623313,NAW,2011-09-21 02:31:00,4022,"Ya.  They where mostly young birds.  The hen mallard was decent.  Hoping to knock down a few colorful drake woodies on Saturday, depending on where I go."
623336,beginner,2011-09-21 04:05:00,542,wow and wow
623339,Sinker,2011-09-21 06:25:00,8692,"I didn't get out for the central opener yet, but we put a hurting on the geese a couple times to get things started       Got a mutant goose too........pretty cool!     congrats on a successful opener Nick! Keep the reports coming!  S."
623344,Billy Bob,2011-09-21 09:32:00,5865,STOP you 2.......you're killing me here......  Found out yesterday I and my partners were not picked AGAIN to hunt opening day on the federal reserve....FRUSTRATING.
623390,NAW,2011-09-21 12:51:00,4022,"I was wondering how you've been doing this season Sinker.  Nice pile a grease there.  I have two breasts from last year in the slow cooker as we speak!  Never seen a goose look like that before.  Looks like a giant hen mallard / goose cross.  If you ever need an extra gun when your in the field, let me know."
623504,Sinker,2011-09-21 16:36:00,8692, You should be booking a canada hunt up here next year for our early goose season to get things rolling. I know this guy who could get you out  S.
623562,Billy Bob,2011-09-21 19:24:00,5865,How much is a hunting license and what kind of hassles is it to bring a shotgun over the boarder ???
623683,NAW,2011-09-22 01:32:00,4022," I don't know anything about bringing a gun over the boarder.  I can tell you what I paid for my licenses.  You need a small game hunting license for the year.  I think that's about $30 (i do the three year thing, so I'm not sure what the yearly cost is).  Then you need a Migratory Game Bird Hunting Seal.  that's about $20.  I'm sure the non-resident pricing will be a little different.  Here's a few links.  Might have to copy and paste.  http://www.ec.gc.ca/rcom-mbhr/default.asp?lang=en&n=99FDEC59-1  http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/en/Business/FW/Publication/MNR_E001275P.html"
623827,Sinker,2011-09-22 15:01:00,8692,"The license is reasonable, but I'm not sure about the price for non res. Getting the gun over the border isn't too bad either, from what I hear, but I've never done it. I guess you have to fill out some paperwork, but its supposed to be pretty straight forward.  A couple buddies of mine drove down to Texas for a turkey hunt this spring, and the border guards didn't even ask to see paperwork for any guns, even though they told them they had them in the truck!  S."
623851,basketclam,2011-09-22 15:42:00,115,"A couple nice sets of pictures there folks.  Haven't been out yet this year due to work (same old story), but I've got an itch that needs a scratch real bad."
623933,Billy Bob,2011-09-22 18:49:00,5865,Got out today.....my old fishing buddy Don called and invited me to hunt Canada geese at the last minute.....not great but pretty good....only 2 small flocks came over and we bagged 9 birds in all....1 had a leg tag.  I actually got 3 birds and that's pretty good for me...
623943,Nipfisher,2011-09-22 19:39:00,2449,Pretty sure I could get a limit of geese with my putter out on the local golf course.
623953,NAW,2011-09-22 19:54:00,4022, Nice.  9 birds out of 2 flocks.  That's good shooting!
624093,Sinker,2011-09-23 04:20:00,8692,"Atta boy Bob! Good shootin!  S,"
