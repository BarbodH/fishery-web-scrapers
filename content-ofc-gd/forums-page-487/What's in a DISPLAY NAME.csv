More specifically your display name (username) and how or why you chose it. Some are yes very obvious, but those that are more obscure, please share if you like.  Mine, it's a play on words from a CBC radio host during the afternoon drive. Been listening to him for a couple years and really enjoyed his show and music and my buddy also messes up his name all the time. He thinks it sounds like ""registerfry"" (his name is Rich Terfry and fellow hosts and guests poke fun at the name). This is also the same guy (my buddy) who penned Patrick Swayze's song ""She Breaks The Wind"". Kinda caught on and I added ""fly"" cuz I started fly fishing before spin.  your turn, and here's hoping the rain eases up, only 7 days left..."

CMT are my initials...and I wasn't feeling all that creative when I joined this community.  I added a ""C"" at the beginning because that was my work logon ID at the time.  My original name here was ccmtcanada...but dropped the Canada after a while."
