623623,hunterjoe84,2011-09-21 22:44:00,52,"I recently bought a stealth cam and have had it set up since the 13th of september and these are the pics so far.  I had a lot of night pics as well, however the infrared was turned off.    "

623691,NAW,2011-09-22 01:51:00,4022,Dang..  Gunna be a fun season.  Does that big boy come around much on the Cam? or only the one shot?
623693,richyb,2011-09-22 01:58:00,774,Holy shiitake mushrooms that buck is a beast ...
623694,Rob,2011-09-22 02:04:00,467,"I don't know if it's going to be that good, that big buck looks like he is giving that camera a big raspberry!  Nice shots!  Rob C"
623708,Skud,2011-09-22 03:00:00,739,Great to see a big buck moving during daylight hours. I can only get pics of mature bucks during the night
623760,LucG,2011-09-22 12:22:00,779,"Nice shots! Your going to love your cam! I began using one three years ago, and not only has it opened my eyes to what goes one when we're not around, but it improved my hunts as well.  One tip that I got when I bought mine that was very useful, was to buy two memory cards. This way when you want to check your pics, simply swap out the cards. No need to remove the cam, or make a trtip back to put the card back in.  Good luck this season!"
623765,oldphart,2011-09-22 12:31:00,665,"~~~Great shots bud, keep posting up come shots"
623770,Harrison,2011-09-22 12:37:00,2202," That's because it's not hunting season yet!  Very nice buck you have on your property there.  Looks like a smart bugger, he's already mocking you."
623782,cjgraham,2011-09-22 13:10:00,104,Wow what a nice buck. Good luck 9 days away from the opener!
623800,hunterjoe84,2011-09-22 14:02:00,52,He is actually eating an apple in that shot. I really hope he shows himself next weekend!!  I have only had the cam since September 13 so that is the first time I have seen him.  Just after I set up the cam I went back to the store to buy a second card for that reason Luc. The less scent there the better!!
623853,basketclam,2011-09-22 15:44:00,115,"Real nice pics!  If they don't put a smile on your face, you've got no pulse."
623952,jedimaster,2011-09-22 19:51:00,3472,"too bad you didn't have the GPS option...  nice buck, I just bought a cam for the first time. I am gonna go up this weekend and set it up."
623969,misfish,2011-09-22 20:38:00,29133,"Nice, real nice. I,ll bet it,s back a bit from the roads and where they feel not threaten. Lots of good cover and easy get away to huge cover if need be.   TFS"
624056,bucktail,2011-09-23 01:07:00,1857,Dude the mass on that buck is awesome!!  Good luck!!
