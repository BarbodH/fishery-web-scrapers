Never caught a laker before but I've formulated my plan.  Hate to say it, but gonna drop some Japanese titanium jigs on em.  With the streamers and ribbon coming off this thing, the fish will think its Chinese New Year."
624239,BillM,2011-09-23 17:40:00,17367,"Figure out the water temp, if the lake is in turnover mode, you'll be able to catch them anywhere from top to bottom."
624242,solopaddler,2011-09-23 17:47:00,8605,"Have a great trip bud.  Caribou is a very deep, clear lake.  If it's post turnover fish deeper than you normally would.  I'm not usually a proponent of live minnows (most times it's not necessary), but big minnows on a simple live bait rig or a jighead work wonders this time of year.  They've saved my bacon more than once after the lake turns over."
624244,Pikeslayer8,2011-09-23 17:54:00,336,"  Thanks Solo, Typically just a crawler or leech guy, but I'll go get my minnow bucket.  Hopefully, I'll find some frozen Cisco on my travels.  Your third trip is coming right up.  Tight lines to you and yours."
624266,solopaddler,2011-09-23 18:47:00,8605," Try and get some 4-5"" chub or sucker minnows enroute. They'll definitely pay dividends with larger fish at the very least.  (You'd need a stinger hook for sure)  Banner year for me. Leaving on my 4th trip Tuesday early am. Nakina here I come."
