623402,johnnyb,2011-09-21 13:09:00,3413,Nice!  
623421,Kanuck,2011-09-21 14:04:00,13,What did the sign say??  Thanks
623437,lookinforwalleye,2011-09-21 14:28:00,4399,  Check your PM
623477,Terry,2011-09-21 15:31:00,14456,good  who is Craig Smith?
623481,capt bruce,2011-09-21 15:34:00,820,Guess hes the sign taker down guy ???
623482,GBW,2011-09-21 15:34:00,8460,Craig is the CO for that area.  He checks my folks lake too.
623498,bigugli,2011-09-21 16:12:00,6138,Nice to see it finally being dealt with. A call to the TIPS hotline got nowhere a few years back.
623513,lookinforwalleye,2011-09-21 16:57:00,4399,  I did not realize it has been going on that long!
623514,Rod Caster,2011-09-21 16:58:00,5784,Glad to hear it.
623515,lookinforwalleye,2011-09-21 16:59:00,4399,"  That is correct, very nice guy very approachable!"
623601,bigugli,2011-09-21 21:33:00,6138,It seemed as though it was an issue many wished to avoid back then. Of course extended internet exposure of the problem sure made it a public issue in a hurry.
623605,Rattletrap2,2011-09-21 21:44:00,1652,"Gord, Good on ya for taking action on this! I met a young CO on the lake quite a few years back that was a real decent hard working guy. I wonder if it is the same guy. He had dark hair and used his own legend boat if I recall?"
623618,GBW,2011-09-21 22:07:00,8460,"Yeah, he's a cool guy. young_one and I were fishing, he came up to us at the ramp asked us ""you wouldn't mind showing me the walleye just to be sure, would you?"" and of course we let him measure it.  he's a real nice guy and I added him to my cell, he even gave my his other cell # just in case I needed it."
623620,ehg,2011-09-21 22:13:00,2666,"Since that activity was improper, awesome that it was addressed.  Was checked by the young CO in Legend a couple of summers ago on Head Lake. Mentioned that we noticed someone coming off lake with about 7lb. walleye. Way bigger than new slot limit. He mentioned he liked the quality of our tinner. Nice guy"
623698,Dave Bailey,2011-09-22 02:32:00,1641,"Good work! I wonder if we'll be hearing any reaction from the 'Lake Dalrymple Anglers Association', or whatever it was."
623897,lookinforwalleye,2011-09-22 17:16:00,4399,  Sounds like the same guy Brian!
623899,lookinforwalleye,2011-09-22 17:19:00,4399,  I highly doubt it I am thinking the good people of Lake Dalrymple will let now live and let live!
