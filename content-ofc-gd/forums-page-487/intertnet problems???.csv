I recieve my phone & internet through a Rogers Rocket Hub. Due to where I live, I get a weak signal, yet sufficient to provide me with constant service. Since May, I noticed it getting worse, dropped calls, internet froze/no signal etc. I called Rogers, and they said that due to the number of ""summer"" residents, that demand on my closest tower is increased. This ""overloads"" the tower and causes the problems. I called Rogers and after 3 calls at almost an hour a piece, I've recieved 2/3 off my monthly bill until the issue resolves itself, or until they do whatever to the tower to accomodate the extra pressure. Seeing as I called last month, and the issue's been since may, they retro'd my rebate back. 95% of the time, my service is fine, it's only here and there that it is an issue. Yes i spent a lot of frustrating time on the phone, but it was worth it."

Finally got a decent stick, Sierra 360, from Telus with a plug in antenna which helped immeasurably. Like yourself, service slows down considerably with increased cell traffic, but is pretty good early in the morning and late in the evening.  I did not subscribe to a 'plan' for any of them."
