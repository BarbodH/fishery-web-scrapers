ARE YOU SERIOUS we just drove through the craziest trail with high hopes to pop out at someones cottage... well i geuse that turned out to be a good thing since the guy knew exactly where the lake was we were heading for... thanks again if your out there haha so we drive one minute down the road and see this little atv trail going into the bush... this must be it without eaven thinking we unload the boat and start are crazy portage atleast 1 km through the bush to be treated with the most beautiful sight in the world... a lake so back to the truck we go to get the trolling motor, battery, rods ect. that was a crazy hike i swear my arms were going to fall off from that battery... so we fish the lake for the couple hours we have of light and geuse what not a single bite..... we saw fish jumping and swirling on the bait fish we ssaw them on the fish finder but not a single bite all that work for nothing... we head back to camp empty handed but leave the boat there for day number two.... revenge again we get to the lake fish for a couple hours see a ton of fish jumping... not a fallow nothing so i heard there was another lake that we can portage to from the one we were on so why not we arnt catching fish here lets go so we portage away and start fishing... after about 5 minutes my floaat flys down i set the hook nothing... danm reeling in i see this huge flash and the biggest brookie i have ever seen in my life missed my worm... ok thiss lake has some active fish in it lets do this about a hour in with nothing to show mickey hooks this skinny little fellow on a spinner  awesome the skunk is off our targeted fish is deffinitly in here so were going drifting the shore line and i throow my float into a patch of weeds all of a sudden my float flys down again this time i hook up and i get him close to the boat here we go this is my biggest brookie... he takes one more run... hits the trolling motor prop.... and shes gonzo deffinitly a 16 inch plus fish so we float around more no hits nothing and we get this hunch lets try some jigging in the deeper water a couple more minutes go by and this chunk of a speck goes into the net mickeys biggest speck proberolly 14 inches   minutes later i finally break my skunk and land this 13 incher   jigs for the next few hours with nothing to show and headed back to poratge our way into the main lake  ill be back up this weekend trying to get the ones i had break off hope u enjoyed my long winded report guys"
