We generally have lots of success for Bass but have only managed to land one walleye (still in the learning stage). If anyone has any tips for spots, bait or anything else it would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks Lukas,"

(Search ""pink don't stink"" on OFC) The same year I got last place in the Stoney Lake combo tourny haha. Well technically we ""didn't finish""... Hit a rock and killed the motor.  Actually I think that tourney is next weekend, or the following."
620985,beagle dad,2011-09-13 12:25:00,224,there is a underwater spring south side of clear half way down the lake  walleye stack up there you can usually tell where it is by the fog that rises fron it in early fall smoke twisters  black pepper will get them
621157,canada414,2011-09-13 19:34:00,40, Yup that's the stoney the tourney is next weekend too

623303,chachi1984,2011-09-21 02:12:00,7,"might be a little late but u can use the info for next time, I used to fish on clear alot,  but not the best fishing spot.  over the span of 3 yrs we landed our share of nice walleye.  average were anywhere from 15-20 inches easy and every summer someone would land some nice monsters too.  over the years we prob landed 5-6 25-30 inchers no joke. best spots we found were off the main channel staight out from youngs point across from the green cottages we got some nice walleye off the red marker in the weeds  another great spot and prob the best  producing area is halfway down on the north side you will see a cottage that looks like a castle you cant miss it. 15-20 feet deep and there are alot of weed beds also the bottom drops off.  it goes from 30ft real fast to about 10-20 and that's where we cought alot of walleye.  we used white mr twisters and they seemed to hit just before dark,  seems like there's an hr window where the action will just pick up.  it will go from being dead to none slop."
