623604,Harrison,2011-09-21 21:43:00,2202,"Good fishing and thanks for posting Mike.  That area is getting more and more publicity over the last few years. Know of a few boats heading out there this fall for the first time.  Getting quite the buzz.  Trade ya a Musky Day for a Steelheading one, their even!"
623609,ctranter,2011-09-21 21:52:00,543,Nice fish!!  We rarely see musky reports like this anymore and they are always a pleasure to read.  My gf didn't believe me that freshwater fish get that big in Ontario.. until I showered her these pics.  She's going to think twice before letting her Yorkie go for a swim!  cheers
623641,mike rousseau,2011-09-21 23:52:00,4661,  ill think about it...  leaning towards yes...
623654,mistyriver1,2011-09-22 00:35:00,600,"Some beauties there Mike.  Congrats, haven't fished down that way in years, time for me to get back there.  Thanks for sharing.  Jim"
623660,Musky or Specks,2011-09-22 00:44:00,2710,OH MAN So worth the blood. Thanks fer the sweet dreams.

623860,fishnsled,2011-09-22 16:05:00,3520,That was 2 hours VERY well spent.
623331,mike rousseau,2011-09-21 03:18:00,4661,Well... Tonight was the start of my break from walleye...  For the next month or so I'm going to be targeting lunge...  And tonight was a great start... We boated 3 musky in 2 hours...  1 trolling and 2 casting  And the big girl hit boatside before my buddy could even start a figure 8... We both saw the take... It was intense  They were 50-40-40 inches                  And my reward...
