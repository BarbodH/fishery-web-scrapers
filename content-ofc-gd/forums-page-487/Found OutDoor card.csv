622824,GBW,2011-09-19 15:10:00,8460,I found R. Sheppard's outdoors card if anyone knows him msg me
622947,whitbyboatguy,2011-09-19 21:54:00,130,or you could give it to MNR if they are willing to send it to the owner. the odds of finding the owner here are almost nothing.
622949,misfish,2011-09-19 21:56:00,29133, You would be surprised what this site can do.
622951,irishfield,2011-09-19 22:00:00,26272,Well Geoff... there only appears to be about 6 or 7 R Sheppard's on 411.ca   Start with the one closest to where you found the card. One is in Jackson Point...
622953,Roy,2011-09-19 22:11:00,13728,"If those 6-7 numbers don't pan out, there's an R. Sheppard in Australia and another in Sri Lanka. Sounds like a long shot I know but if you want the numbers, PM me."
622958,whitbyboatguy,2011-09-19 22:22:00,130, I am always surprised when the site takes a long winded way of accomplishing something (OK...less and less surprised). The phone call thing is the best it is going to get for a personal touch.
622963,danbouck,2011-09-19 22:39:00,4380,"I woudln't say long winded, probably took less time to post than your reply"
622965,misfish,2011-09-19 22:42:00,29133,"   YA SEE, THERE YA GO.  A member has come through with advise to help find the owner.And I,ll bet GBW, will do his best."
622971,GBW,2011-09-19 22:58:00,8460,"Dude's in Japan!  just kidding...  I'm not long winded whitbyboatguy, I just have lots of wind...  now wouldn't you be happy if I posted it and it was your card?"
622978,whitbyboatguy,2011-09-19 23:15:00,130, Many threads on this forum are.  I would consider myself fortunate that I was able to find the person holding onto my card instead of turning it into the MOE to return to me in time for weekend fishing so I would not have to buy another one.  If I found the card I might call the R. Sheppards in the phone books before turning it in.
622982,whitbyboatguy,2011-09-19 23:21:00,130,.....and after I got it I would be thankful that someone actually did something with it instead of throwing it out or kicking it into the water.
623123,johnnyb,2011-09-20 13:04:00,3413,Oh that reminds me...if anyone is on the river between Little and Big Missisnaibi lake....my card is in there somewhere....but it's expired now so you don't have to call me if you find it
623350,Billy Bob,2011-09-21 10:00:00,5865,Last August I found a credit card at the MGM Grand casino in Vegas....had a Asian name on it the best I could tell...turned it in at the front desk of the hotel. I hope that person got it back without having a heart attack first.
623462,lplp,2011-09-21 15:03:00,83,"If he has luck like me , he probable threw his card away and said ,what a waste of money ,i dont catch fish anyways ,here you go to the fishing gods and good riddens,see ya,, i am never going to fish again ,, dam where did i put my card i think i want to go fishing.."
