487425,scugpg,2010-07-22 11:23:00,1373,Awesome deal on an awesome charger http://www.canadiantire.ca/AST/browse/4/Auto/BatteryChargersAccessories/BatteryChargers/PRDOVR~0111522P/CTEK%252BMulti-use%252B3300%252B3.3A%252BBattery%252BCharger.jsp
487428,SlowPoke,2010-07-22 11:29:00,2984,I bought this charger on your recomendation and it's outstanding! I might get another one too!
487429,Fisherman,2010-07-22 11:34:00,7201,"Off to the store, hopefully there's one left for me, they definitely work."
487442,Fish4Eyes,2010-07-22 12:31:00,1022,This charger was recommended to me by a guy who works in the Interstate warehouse. Said its one of the best out there.
487572,scugpg,2010-07-22 22:52:00,1373,I have two already....I'd like to buy a spare but with a 5yr warranty I'll probably be ok.  This is the best charger I've used and Optima acknowledges it as one that works well.
487573,scugpg,2010-07-22 22:53:00,1373, Glad its working bud....when we going fishing!
487672,ohhenrygsr,2010-07-23 06:21:00,947,is the sale over not listed on sale on the web  never mind found it on the E-Flyer  Ahh Crap the Sale Ended Yesterday
487676,SlowPoke,2010-07-23 09:48:00,2984, How about tonight? Give me a shout after lunch (have to sleep)
487678,scugpg,2010-07-23 10:50:00,1373, I'd love to but the weather isn't being nice http://www.theweathernetwork.com/weather/caon0383  Need to buy anything at AO? We could maybe do a trip out there tonight or tomorrow instead.
487838,SlowPoke,2010-07-23 18:19:00,2984,"I can't think of anything I need and that's the most dangerous time to go to AO; you usually end up buying something you want. I think I should take a pass and tinker with the boat. Drop by if you're passing through, show me whatcha got!"
487909,ctdd2006,2010-07-23 23:18:00,531,...read this post last night and went to CTC today to buy it!  Unbelievably they had it in stock but the sale ended yesterday and I had to pay full pin if I wanted it!  I'll wait a little!!!
488082,knightfisher,2010-07-24 21:23:00,237,I picked up the CTEK charger today. I just called around and asked if they would still honor last weeks sale and was told yes. So you can still get it for 40% off if you do the same. Great charger from the reviews I read on the net. Plus CT is giving a 5 year exchange warranty. Can't beat that!!!
488099,Fish Farmer,2010-07-24 23:43:00,2234,They gave me a rain check at the Queenston store Hamilton yesterday $53.99
488339,Guest LivingLegend,2010-07-26 00:47:00,0,"Was reading the back and it says recommended for automobiles, whats up?"

488440,Guest LivingLegend,2010-07-26 12:38:00,0,Ok but is it good for deep cycle charging? It mentions smaller boats but thats it.......guess its  a good dal for the other stuff it mentions............
488444,knightfisher,2010-07-26 12:53:00,237,"First, thanks scugog for letting us know this was on sale. Never heard of CTEK before. LL, printed on the first page of the CTEK user manual, ""professional charging of starter and deep cycle batteries"""
