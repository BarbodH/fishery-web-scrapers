623298,ccmtcanada,2011-09-21 01:59:00,7971,"So, how was your 2011 soft water season?  Did you get out as much as you usually do or did other commitments keep you off the water or shoreline?  How would you rate the fishing overall?  Were the numbers there compared to your average?  If you caught a PB, post a pic for all to see again!  Share some thoughts here!  I didn't get out nearly as much as I would have liked too...a little more than last year and a lot LESS than a few years ago.  Overall the fishing has been below average for me...numbers per trip way down for me.  I did however work on bass fishing and managed to improve a little there!  I'm looking forward to fall...to play with the trib steelhead, hopefully a few big walleye, and a nice chunky fall muskie!"
623310,mercman,2011-09-21 02:20:00,7054,"Oh Ya...Its been a good season !!!! Since i got my new boat, this has been my nest year ever   Got my first Musky ever.That was a sweet day indeed.  My personal Best Walleye  Got to eat some fresh walleye  Did some great LMB fishing   Pike were always in the picture  Ahhhh Perch  Busted a prop   Yup, its been a great year so far, but its not over yet."
623311,ccmtcanada,2011-09-21 02:26:00,7971,GREAT stuff mercman!  I've really enjoyed your reports this year
623328,Skipper D,2011-09-21 03:06:00,1970,"HOLY,  ITS A TRUE FRENCH ONE ALL RIGHT , DA GUYS GOT DA RED ONE , DA BEST CALIRE IN A BOAT YOU CAN HAVE ....man that sure is nice ."
623332,solopaddler,2011-09-21 03:19:00,8605,"Are you involved in marketing Cliff?  Regarding the last question, what if you already have gargantuan pb's for all species?"
623357,asdve23rveavwa,2011-09-21 11:04:00,2690,"Good year overall.  Average number of trips, maybe slightly less due to some house repairs/reno. Got to fish some new water, and, did manage one PB...big greasy 31 1/2"" laker    Time for some perch, my favorite fish to eat, then bring on those November steelies!!!!!  Also hit a numbers PB for walleye...37 in one day.  Amazing what those northern waters can cough up."
623358,mercman,2011-09-21 11:04:00,7054,  Then ya just have to keep sharing them with us
623361,ccmtcanada,2011-09-21 11:10:00,7971," Mike...you know what I do for a living lol, but this is for pure interest sake!  And regarding the PB, if you didn't get any you shoud have chose ""I forgot my camera""!!!"
623367,mike rousseau,2011-09-21 11:21:00,4661,I hit a pb for numbers... A couple times... My new pb for numbers of walleye is 35!!!  And I'm ahead of pace to hit 500 walleye this year!!!!
623377,fishindevil,2011-09-21 11:57:00,6254,"did awesome this year,sveral walleyes over 7lbs,a new personal best for largemout,and caught at least a few hundred walleyes with one more trip to go on the thanksgiving long weekend,so that will be another 100 walleyes to the list..."
623388,johnnyb,2011-09-21 12:38:00,3413,"Hmmm....no true pb's for me this year...but managed to get out a fair bit.  Pretty much every weekend, which sounds like a lot, but only a few hours a day here and there.  It wasn't as much as back in the day when I was a teenager with no job and all summer to fish....but..considering I'm married with 2 kids...I did allright I did however manage to rekindle my love of bass fishing and learn a few new techniques, after spending the last couple seasons trolling for lakers.  Actually.....maybe there was a pb....got a 26"" laker...not my biggest ever, but my biggest trolling so far.  Also fished my first tournament...it was just for fun with a few guys...but there were real bassboats involved, and competing against other fishermen was awesome...changed the way I worked the water for the rest of the year. Took a car-camping trip to Temagami that was a bit of a letdown fishing-wise, although I watched my cousin absolutely shatter his pb pike with a nice wide 36""er...that was awesome. Will get out a handful of more times up in Muskoka/Minden, plus one killer trip for stocked, year-round brookies in October...that has potential to be the highlight of the year...so I'm totally fine to let summer hurry up and end!            "
623395,lew,2011-09-21 12:57:00,12766,"I don't fish nearly as much as I used to,  I just seem to have alot of other stuff going on these day. I used to average around 70-100 muskies a year so maybe I just wore myself out  This  is my largest fish so far this year but BIG fish season is starting and we do a few fall trips every year to BIG fish waters, both in Eastern  and  Southwestern Ontario.  "
623400,Jer,2011-09-21 13:06:00,1426,"Fished around home (Buckhorn & Chemong) about the same as most years with a couple camping trips (Lakair & Crotch) thrown in.  Overall, I'd say it was a pretty good year. Although no PBs were caught, except for my buddy's 7lb pickerel on Chemong, most times out we caught some quality fish, especially for bass with lots of 3 1/2 to 5 pounders over the summer.  We always struggle for fish in the fall, but soon it'll be time for jumbo perch off the dock in the evenings with always the chance for a big pickerel looking for a snack. We usually don't catch much but a good excuse for a fire and some beer."
623407,slightlyhuman,2011-09-21 13:25:00,29,"had a great summer, got to do a lot of fishing in a rock quarry so i got pretty spoiled, but still got some decent fish back at my parents in the kawarthas.  CANT WAIT to get out on kempenfelt for some late season smallies!  5lb smallie from shore.  4lb largie    these bottom 3 are the same 6lb HOG "
623415,Beans,2011-09-21 13:36:00,3339,"So far this year has been a not so good one...Cold spring kinda put a kibosh on the crappy fishing and the carp afterwards was a bust at the point this year...I think CPH caught the only one there...My back and legs have been giving me a lot of grief so never got the Tin of Beans in the water but I doubt I would have used it much during those real hot summer days...the only luck I had was at my friend Ron's swims for carp...best day I hooked five and landed two and the day there with Meely, Zen, and Maribeth we hooked four and landed two...Yesterday I was skunked for the first time since last June but I got to be net man for a new chap who has netted most of mine the past six weeks so I guess that is fair...The nice part about fishing at Ron's is parking beside the river and not having to cart all our gear for a long distance...too bad it isn't closer to Bobcaygeon (50 kms)...I usually fish there when I have another excuse that takes me to P'boro like yesterday's doctor appointment...  Not sure if this was a PB as the picture does not show how thick it was across the shoulders...  "
623422,solopaddler,2011-09-21 14:05:00,8605, But that implies a certain level of incompetence.    BAH! That's a good morning.    
623432,Leecher,2011-09-21 14:24:00,7832,"For me it was a very slow year fishing wise.... Early spring I always target speckles cause it's the only species that is open and always look forward to a nice snack lol  Caught lots of them this year but were on the small size... between 6"" and 8"" for the most part.  I did manage a PB laker 24"" which was nice and a PB whitie 22""  A few SMB's and LMB's and that is about it for this season... Now that fall is coming, I'll be looking for another kind of PB... the kind with 4 legs and fur Leechman  P.S. Edited to say: Check the tournament section for my 2 PB's"
623447,cjgraham,2011-09-21 14:35:00,104,PB Walleye 10lb 34in on May 24. Started out fishing almost every day then I got married in July....been out maybe 5 times since then...    
623458,registerfly,2011-09-21 14:58:00,198,"For our (13 yr old son and myself) first real fishing season, I'd say we fished quite a bit. Not the numbers quantity wise like some of you but learned our fair share. Bought a guide pontoon in the early spring and wasn't able to get her into the water due to a crappy May, but once we did it was like both days each weekend. Mainly smaller lakes and reservoirs. I would have to say the young guy has a knack or passion for the sport. Outfishes me and the buddies this year, and looks like the patience is setting in. Blow by blow of the season.  Ice fishing mainly Simcoe. This season we are all geared up with hut on order and new heater (we're wussies in the cold) WaterFalls Lodge trip-great LMB/SMB/and pike. 3.5 days of complete fishing. Rice Lake walleye opener, brought home 8 between a couple guys and many SMB that went back in L Ont charter ended up bringing in plenty of salmon and rainbows. Kid got the largest again just under 30lb or so. Island Lake, Scugog, Mounstberg, Valens, Ken Whillans, we hit them all multiple times. Would have to say majority of fish were pike and LMB.  Thanks to fellow member Roger, spent almost a full week up at his beautiful cottage fishing SMB and pike to end off August. Kid won the min derby we there too.  Been hitting the Grand and Credit as of late with good success. SMB and freshwater tarpon (mooneyes I was told) on the Grand. Beautiful browns on the credit.  that leaves us with steelies for the fall.  enjoy the rest of the season, might post up some pics later on if I can."
623473,msp,2011-09-21 15:26:00,1336,"Spring pike and trout has been amazing for me this year.Bass fishing has been fun with great numbers of fish averaging 20 fish per day. A few good fish over 4 # to be had but not the size that I had last year. Still lots of time for the fall giants. I fished 5 new lakes this year which is always fun , challenging and exciting. I will post a year end re-cap when the open water season comes to an end.  Hope everybody has a great fall."
623494,fishnsled,2011-09-21 16:07:00,3520,"This year got off to a very slow start while the boat was in the shop. Then Dad past away, finally hit the water mid June. Slow start with smaller fish but some numbers. A trip to Eddie's on Beateau Lake helped get the size and numbers up.  Smaller fish seems to have been my theme since then for some reason. Haven't had the drive to fish as much or as often this year and have missed a few weekends. Normally missing a day on the water would drive me crazy, this year, not so much. Hoping for a banner fall season though."
623501,manitoubass2,2011-09-21 16:24:00,11391,"So far, this has been a great season for me and my family! Itès just getting to the good part of the season, so were far from done yet  Its been a numbers year though, for the most part. I got a PB pike, which I was really stoked on, since I just started taking pike fishing seriously this year.  Ive been out fishing just as much as last year, maybe 150 times .  This year I wanted to focus on some new techniques, which I did. I also refined some older ones! And, I wanted to take two of my boys out more and let them try alot of new things now that their getting better and better as anglers. Basically this year I was letting them pick cranks to fish, last year, they didnt get to do that very often. All my kids got PB of some kind, which is awesome. And they got to see some different species, like sunfish, crappie, rock bass, lakers and bluegill. Oh yeah, sturgeon as well.  My proudest moment this year was my oldest boy landing a 6lb laker from hit to finish! Made me very proud. Still waiting on the pics from his grandma though.  Its been a great year thus far. Now its time for big walleye and feedbag smallies!"
623529,asdve23rveavwa,2011-09-21 17:36:00,2690,"  Man, I can't wait for the year that I can get out 150 times!!!!  Although I could probably swing it if I went to the local reservoir all the time,"
623531,manitoubass2,2011-09-21 17:42:00,11391," lol, Im just making up for the five years I could barely get out at all. The past three years have helped alot, lol   "
