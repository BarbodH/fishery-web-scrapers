623288,Tootsie II,2011-09-21 01:37:00,162,"A word to the wise. When my daughter took her driver's ed course, her instructor told her if you ever hit a deer or any other large animal, you should always say that the it jumped or ran into the path of your car. Apparently some cops have been known to ""split hairs"" and if you say that you hit it, they say you therefore did not have proper care and control of your vehicle and they will try making a careless driving case out of it. Then also if he does that it could make any insurance claim for damage to your vehicle very difficult. Even if the case gets tossed, you've still had a hell of a headache to clear yourself."
623305,Dara,2011-09-21 02:14:00,3052,  The secretary kinda liked the gold reciever on it...I guess its all what you're used to
623394,Headhunter,2011-09-21 12:54:00,5703," Well, here in ""The Big Smoke"", if one of my employees brought their gun to work, the first thing I would ask them is, is your gun going to make us any money? Because really, work is about making money. That may be considered a bad attitude north of 17, but in reality, that's why we work. And if one of my employess brought in their; -fishing rod -model car/airplane -guitar etc..., I would have the same attitude. That my friend is the opinion of a ""Big Smoke"" dweller. HH"
623398,Dara,2011-09-21 13:02:00,3052,  Yep..gotta make money to pay the McGuinty taxes and power bills
623413,Headhunter,2011-09-21 13:35:00,5703,"Yup and it's gonna get worse... just found out that Uncle Dalty has already signed off on charging us HST on smart meters. Yes, you read that right, he has approved an HST charge on using smart meters, which, btw, they insisted on installing at our homes... HH"
623416,solopaddler,2011-09-21 13:46:00,8605, Half of my office is already off on stress leave.
623448,Waterfowlr,2011-09-21 14:36:00,19,"As always...lots of ideas and assumptions....but Fisherman is correct.  MNR state that if you want to keep the black bear, woodland caribou, white-tailed deer, American elk, or moose,  YOU SHALL report the acquisition immediately to the nearest MNR office.  This can be as simple as calling the MNR and letting them know the details and where the animal is being kept.  If a CO wants to come and inspect it, they might and you are then covered. If you don't want the deer and it is dead and not suffering, you can just leave it in the ditch.  Usually someone else will come along shortly and claim it...or as stated a few times...Call another OFNer.  As for Police.  They cannot give you permission to have the deer, etc... even though they sometimes think they can.  Always call the MNR and get the permit of reporting!  You might need the Police though for the accident report if damage was done!  Cheers!"
623456,HTHM,2011-09-21 14:51:00,4082,That's understandable.....they work with you.
623487,jedimaster,2011-09-21 15:46:00,3472,"Not that hard to skin a deer. We usually hang it head pointed up. cut around the neck through the skin, then down the center of the neck all the way to where you cut the abdomin to get the gut pile out. (Oh yah do that first).  cut the butt hole out, and tie it in a knot then pull it out from inside.  Try not to puncture any of the organs. Then do the same as the neck for each of the legs, and start pulling the hide off.  once its pulled off, you can clean up the meat  and get all the hair off. Now just follow the bones and cut the pieces of meat off. There is a tenderloin inside the rib cage by the spine but its usually real small in a doe. Looks similare to if you go to a grocery store and buy a pork tenderloin. The back strap is the nicest cut in a deer for steaks. Its allong the spine on the ooutside. The thighs make good roasts, and the rest of the meat we tend to use for either ground venicine, peperettes or sausage."
623546,capt bruce,2011-09-21 18:32:00,820,"Glad to hear you were not hurt, I posted a while ago about my incounter with a 10 point buck . my poor honda civic was written off ,deer came into front seat via windshield ,I was luckie enough to escape with a few stiches in my leg (antler went thu calf in and out )But you know that deer tasted beter than any I have eaten , opp gave me deer ,the officer who took my to hosiptal delivered it to my house skined and gutted the next day . Like I said glad to see you were not injured ."

622976,Gerritt,2011-09-19 23:10:00,6129,"Well last night I hit a doe... No damage to my truck (thank god for Fords metal bumper) other them a bit of fur... nothing wrong to the truck..  it was a decent sized doe, feeding @ an apple tree that is right beside the road   :wallbash:     (Low ditch where the apples collect when they fall..)Hence the deer collect here...  What are the rules when it comes to this? I do not have a hunting license.. but I do enjoy venison.  I was unsure what to do.. and had no room in the back of my pickup, given the hard one piece tonneau cover, and it being rammed with tools.  I did stop, inspected my truck, and made sure the doe was not suffering.  Nor do I know how to properly dress a deer...  So I was at a loss....  This morning the deer was gone... I assume someone has filled their freezer...  What should I have done in this case? knowing that I love a good feed of venison... would the meat even of been any good?  Thanks,  G."
622979,lew,2011-09-19 23:16:00,12766," Your lucky Gerritt, my daughter hit a deer last year and did $7000 damage to her car."
622983,misfish,2011-09-19 23:22:00,29133,"With the cool temps these past days,the deer would of been fine til the AM. If you hit a deer and report it right away,it is yours.Just have to wait for the Local police or OPP to show up.  I hear ya tho bro on the hard chrome bumpers.  Dang,if you only lived closer."
622985,Terry,2011-09-19 23:24:00,14456,you can call the police/mnr in many areas they have the phone number of someone who will come and claim it  you could all the police/mnr and claim it yourself if you wanted too
622987,Bob,2011-09-19 23:29:00,370,"Might have been some bruising at point of impact but most of the meat would have been fine.  At one time, if you hit an animal, you could claim it and take it home but I don't know if laws have changed lately. Best thing would have been to call police and report it, they'd likely tell you to take it with you anyway. Saves calling a cleanup crew. Dress a deer same as a rabbit, just on a larger scale."
623001,Whitespinnerbait,2011-09-20 00:01:00,2038,Keep on Driving
623027,NAW,2011-09-20 00:42:00,4022,"Like Bob said.  You likely would have had to toss some of the meat, depending on what part of the deer you hit.  But you would still be able to get a pile of meat from her.  Glad to hear you didn't cause any damage to the truck."
623028,Musky or Specks,2011-09-20 00:46:00,2710,You must report any collision to the police. Yes you can keep the deer. Voice of experience. Thank goodness it was the company limo and not my car.
623029,Fisherman,2011-09-20 00:47:00,7201,"Legally to claim it, you must call the MNR, report a deer strike, they will send you a letter that gives you authority to possess the road kill.(Sort of like a tag).  At the same time call the local police, they will or should give you a file number for reporting it that will give proof of an accident should the MNR question it.  I've done it a number of times. Then comes the 10 minute job of dressing it, finding a safe place to hang it, slice, dice, bag and tag it for the freezer.  I'm sure one of the ""neighbouring"" OFNers would give you a hand for a burger or two."
623031,NAW,2011-09-20 00:52:00,4022, Absolutely!!
623037,misfish,2011-09-20 01:06:00,29133,"Not true. Man I hate this part.Hate to argue a point with a friend. Today you need to call the locals or OPP. We had one hit here on Essa rd. The local cop shot it(after it was hit by a car),and a passer by took it,with the cops permission and the person that hit it."
623041,Dara,2011-09-20 01:33:00,3052,"Grab your knife, knock the backstraps out of it and leave.  When I'm running 17 north I carry an axe and a knife with me just in case a semi hits a moose."
623073,fishinguypat,2011-09-20 04:09:00,547,the laws are you make some deer sausage.
623080,Jewelbee,2011-09-20 08:38:00,422,"Yes.. Around here, report it and it's yours:) Had 2 men show up at my door one night, just hit one.(A neighbor told them to come see me) I was licensed at the time and put her out of her misery and field dressed her for them...Had a good laugh at 2 big men gagging too LOL!!!!!!!!!!!"
623086,solopaddler,2011-09-20 09:34:00,8605,  That right there is the difference between northern and southern Ontario.  Can you imagine some A-type yuppie speeding down the QEW with an axe and a knife in the back seat of his beemer just in case he comes across a dead moose?  
623087,Billy Bob,2011-09-20 09:50:00,5865,Rule #1 Call BILLY BOB.......  that's what we call road kill pot luck dinner..  Our deer season using rifles/shotguns begins on Nov 19th and runs for about 3 weeks...but our deer season using Buicks runs all year long...
623088,Handlebarz,2011-09-20 10:05:00,3790,Around here some of the police know the wifes cousin really well (yes he is a good guy just friends of the police) they know that Dennis will come out and take care of the road kill he has got many deer that way. My favorite one was when he saw a car hit a deer he pulled over right away but so did a cop she was just young and new to the force. He explained to her what he would do with the deer and he would put it out of its pain before he sliced it up (my words) but she insisted that she shoot it after getting the shakes from her hand she finally killed the thing I guess she just wanted to shoot something and that was a good place to start. I wonder what the others of her police force called her when she filed the report for firing her gun???
623097,Fisherman,2011-09-20 11:38:00,7201," From the Ontario MNR website:  What To Do With Road Kill If You Accidentally Hit Wildlife on the Road    Every person who acquires the carcass of a black bear, woodland caribou, white-tailed deer, American elk, or moose SHALL report the acquisition immediately to the nearest MNR office."
623098,Rod Caster,2011-09-20 11:39:00,5784," Haha too funny. If a suit in a Bimmer got caught with an axe in his car, he'd better have a good explanation and several credible witnesses on stand by.  Up here, especially in the fall, fresh roadkill does not last long. Often you'll see a lineup of guys in Mattawa tuxedos (orange gear) waiting for the cops to clear the carcass. I once called my bro to a fresh scene and he got himself a few nice flanks. FREE MEAT! By the way he is from Mattawa hahaha"

623156,Dara,2011-09-20 16:35:00,3052,"  You think thats funny?  How bout this.  The other day, a guy I work with walks into the office carrying a gold plated 45 cal lever action rifle...not in a case.  He walks through the main office and into my office and holds it up and says...hey...like my new gun.  I look up and say...wow, that ever pretty.  A couple days later I have my 270 bolt on my desk messing with setting up the scope with one of the supervisors.  This is pretty standard stuff around here.  Try doing that downtown big smoke"
623161,Billy Bob,2011-09-20 16:59:00,5865,When I went to high school we got one legal day off to hunt per year...all you had to do is bring your hunting license to the principals office and request what day off you needed...
623175,solopaddler,2011-09-20 18:09:00,8605,  Sounds like an episode of The Office. (redneck northern version  )  Also a place I'd like to work.  Down this way swat would be called LOL!
