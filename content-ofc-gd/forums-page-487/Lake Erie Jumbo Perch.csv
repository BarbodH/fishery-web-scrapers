623202,Joey,2011-09-20 20:01:00,9122,Now there's a nice feast.  Well done
623256,Billy Bob,2011-09-21 00:08:00,5865,THANKS guys and gals....but it's really nothing that special....more of a tease to get you out from behind them there computers and behind your gunnels to catch some fish.......now go CATCH a FISH...  Bob
622426,Billy Bob,2011-09-18 10:05:00,5865,"Fished from about 8am till noon and between the 2 of us we caught 33 jumbo Lake Erie perch...largest 14"" caught by my partner John...he had the hot hand yesterday...  First spot we anchored we caught about a dozen and decided to move in a little before calling it quits....the slight move payed off in big dividends (perch)....other boats started to creep in on us but it was no use...we had the once forbidden bait because I made a special run on Friday to the Niagara River and dipped my own Lake Erie Emerald Shiners....when we left we gave our extra bait away to the 3 sorry souls in the boat closest to us...they bought golden shiners from the bait store near the launch...BIG MISTAKE....here's hoping all our bait shops switch over to the ""GOOD STUFF""  soon...    Fishing depths and exact locations available upon PM requests only.  Now go catch a fish, Bob"
622438,danbouck,2011-09-18 12:06:00,4380,"  I don't leave without the ""GOOD STUFF"""

622465,Skipper D,2011-09-18 14:11:00,1970,"Honey ! put the Bass back in the fridge , Billys got some real nice perch he wants to share ............. lol ....lol .

622469,Rod Caster,2011-09-18 14:32:00,5784,Placing them in buckets is very harmful to the fish.... putting them in your stomach is just cruel.
622637,crappieperchhunter,2011-09-18 21:56:00,2582,Nice perch porn Billy Bob  :thumbsup_anim:    I'm hoping to hit my honey hole for the first time next Sunday.  Enjoy the fish fry.
