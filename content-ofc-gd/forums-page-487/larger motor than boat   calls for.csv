623158,Dara,2011-09-20 16:49:00,3052,  sounds like you have enough weight in scrap aluminum there to buy yourself a new motor and go fishing rather than work on stuff
623296,Michael_Brown,2011-09-21 01:56:00,411,"If anyone finds a police boat that is outfitted with the proper HP rated engine please let me know. Hard to find HP stickers on those boats. Last one I looked at should have been powered by a 75hp, engine installed looked like nothing under 150hp. Of course they don't need to worry about insurance, just loosing the boat off the trailer in public.  Please complete the Darwin awards application before launching your new Starcraft rocket."
623333,lookinforwalleye,2011-09-21 03:24:00,4399, Ya and if he slaps that 80 on the old starcraft he`ll have a bunch more scrap to add to the pile!
622680,hirk,2011-09-19 00:11:00,571,"The transom may handle it fine, max coat guard ratings are determined via a formula that take length and width into account, the problem you may run into is that structurally the boat was not built to run that fast and therefore may =loose rivots, cracks etc in the hull."
622682,vinnimon,2011-09-19 00:25:00,2593,"  Tim, Wayne has described my feelings about it bud.She runs great on the 40 hp."
622702,walleyemen,2011-09-19 01:36:00,316,"Really,what the heck are they used for then lol! we had a guy from our club that had to have the tag changed by the manufactur before he could use his boat or get any insurance on it, maybe it was the insurance factor, i see skinnys point about the weight, but man the torque thats going to inflict on that transome is going to be the insane, skinny god luck and let us know how you make out! Man i hope that boats not a tracker.......!lol"
622713,BillM,2011-09-19 02:10:00,17367,"Man, I can't imagine a 16ft tiller with a 80 on the back, lol!!!!  60 sure, but 80 is pushing it."

622732,Skipper D,2011-09-19 02:58:00,1970,"If after trying it and all works well and you like it but are afraid of getting checked out by you know who while your on the water one day , peel the decals off it and redecal it with the right hp # for the boat , but you did'nt hear it here ."
622733,woodenboater,2011-09-19 02:59:00,2277,Not something I would run but could the transom be beefed up with stronger knee braces or is this basically a non starter to begin with ? I know I would feel a bit spooked running 80 horses on a 16 foot tinny cuz I'd wanna see how it felt wot which would be a real bad idea.
622736,Sinker,2011-09-19 03:06:00,8692,"I have a 16 starcraft widebody tiller, and there is no damn way I'd put an 80 on it!! My 40 Mariner is a perfect match for that boat. She handles like a dream!  S."
622754,mugsmuffin,2011-09-19 11:34:00,17,It's not so much the weight as it is the torque on the transom
622777,Fish Farmer,2011-09-19 12:38:00,2234,"80 HP on a 16'tiller is a accident going some place to happen. I have a 50 Honda on my 16' Princecraft Holiday tiller and it's scary by myself. If you heading into the wind, it wants to take flight"
622848,DanD,2011-09-19 16:30:00,2223,"It’s not just the transom but the bow that’s also going to take a beating. Max horse power also means limiting the boats speed and the amount of pounding the bow will have to take. Believe me I’ve been there; when I stuck a 40 on a12 footer. Man did she come up on plain in a hurry and all was going well, until I hit about a 2 foot wave dead on and then the boat got real directional all of a sudden? I mean the thing would dive in the direction you were attempting to go to; didn’t dare sneeze or you be going the opposite direction. Didn’t know what happened until I loaded the boat back on the trailer. You know how the bow usually bellies out from the centre line; well this one was now bellied in; I mean it looked like a highway snow plow the V type. I don’t think anyone could have bent it in more precisely then what that wave and speed did. It also took one heck of a lot of pounding to get it somewhat back in shape; let alone welding in webbing to hold it there.  Dan."
622859,irishfield,2011-09-19 17:22:00,26272,Yep.. water becomes pretty hard at speeds the hull wasn't designed for !!  (but I don't mind writing the invoices!)
622862,lookinforwalleye,2011-09-19 17:32:00,4399,So ya think we convinced him guys?  Dan had a good idea fix it and sell it and put the money towards a smaller motor or that motorhome the wife wants!
622910,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-09-19 19:44:00,1107,"Skinny  when you overpower a boat some work just fine and some are immposible to drive and dangerous .The max hp ratings are kinda all over the place my boat is rated max 125hp but lund makes several 17'6"" that are rated for 150hp  my boats longer and the same width but lower HP rating and some 16'ers are rated for 75hp so 80 isn't that insane but I definately wouldn't put a 250hp on my boat"
622915,lew,2011-09-19 19:57:00,12766,"And to keep things interesting, my last boat was a 1650 Crestliner with 2 different horsepower ratings with both indicated on the capacity plate of the boat.  U.S. Coast Guard rated the boat for 90 HP, which it had, but Canadian Coast Guard only rated it for 50 HP.  I called CCG and was told Canada always under rated the maximum power but didn't know why. He did say though, that if I exceeded the 50 HP rating and had an at fault accident with the boat, I would probably have a hard time getting the insurance company to pay any $$$$."
622923,misfish,2011-09-19 20:36:00,29133, And boy does that boat fly with that 90. I was totally impressed how it kept up to you Lew.

622943,Canadiancontent,2011-09-19 21:39:00,2,"In addition to damaging the boat I would be carful not to over rev the 80HP motor at high sped as you might not have enough ""load"" on it with that light boat."
622952,Roy,2011-09-19 22:05:00,13728,"I'm having trouble imagining an 80 horse Merc being light than a 40 horse anything. Mercury only manufactured 80hp units between 1960 and 1989. So your ""newer/lighter"" engine is between 22 and 51 years old. That is a heavy motor. I would not take a chance."
622961,danbouck,2011-09-19 22:34:00,4380," I can see it, the 40 is a 1962 I believe."
623009,skinny,2011-09-20 00:07:00,442,the 40 hp is a 66 but looks the same as my 61 spare I have too the 80 hp will be prob a test run and sell I'm thinking or maybe it will be saved for a new hull (in my dreams)  the story I got on the 80 is that the bottom end was removed to do  impeller and a bolt got broke so it never got put back together i ckecked and it has a new impeller. Still havn't found the broken bolt (haven't looked much) the power head turns over. pulled the plugs and loaded it full of 2stroke oil  (no real clue as to how long it sat). She will smoke alot when she starts but been there before.  I keep this up and I'm going to look like a outboard shop curently have 59 gale 12hp  (needs coils) 12hp elto (parts motor for gale) 18hp Nissian (for sale) 62 9.8 merc (needs check valves for fuel pump ) 61 evenude 40 man shift (just got running needs carb clean) 66 rude 40 electric shift  (incurent use on boat) 80hp merc in basket now

622606,skinny,2011-09-18 20:58:00,442,ok I have a 16ft starcraft tiler i have been runing a old heavy 40hp this is the max size the hull is rated for.I just aquired another motor (needs work) but it's a larger hp rating . the bigger motor is lighter than the old one. i'm thinking of runing the bigger motor cause i don't have to run full out.  what issues might I encounter
622607,irishfield,2011-09-18 21:00:00,26272, OH.. you'll run full out just to see how fast it goes! Don't kid yourself...
622608,fish_fishburn,2011-09-18 21:01:00,1311,How bigs the motor?
622610,Terry,2011-09-18 21:06:00,14456,"any insurance will be void  but if the transom is strong enough, then .......and I have done it and lived to talk about it"
622611,mike rousseau,2011-09-18 21:06:00,4661,"im not sure...  but i dont think the weight is the issue...  i think it has to do with keeping the ""ride"" of the boat safe and balenced...  not sure tho...   id love to hear a real answer to this question..."
622612,vinnimon,2011-09-18 21:07:00,2593,"From my recolection it ran pretty smooth. I would just leave it alone, its at its max rating anyway."
622616,skinny,2011-09-18 21:16:00,442,it does work good but this is newer motor merc 80hp so yes lots bigger I know but like i said no need to go to full out i was thinking it being lighter would be better too
622617,mike rousseau,2011-09-18 21:16:00,4661,Is there a problem with your 40?  That's what I have on my 16 lund... Gets 25-30 mph depending on what we eat at lunch...lol
622620,fish_fishburn,2011-09-18 21:19:00,1311,"K if it's a 90hp tiller. Don't do it. It depends how solid the boat is etc, running the river or on a lake? If its a 60 and you feel confident your piloting skills are up to the match, go for it. Were not talking insurance here, save it for another thread."
622621,skinny,2011-09-18 21:21:00,442,insurance I don't use it
622623,fish_fishburn,2011-09-18 21:23:00,1311,Oops 80.....I wouldn't.
622624,Terry,2011-09-18 21:25:00,14456,double the HP   maybe not  I can't see this as a good idea
622627,mike rousseau,2011-09-18 21:32:00,4661,A 16 tiller... 80hp... I'd say no go...  I've been driving motorized tiller boats since I was 7-8....  And the max I'd put on my 16 lund would be a 60... And  I have a bow mount and two huge deep cycle batteries in the front of my boat for weight...
622635,skinny,2011-09-18 21:52:00,442,the merc weights less than the old evinrude that I have hanging of it now (yes I checked it) So the weight issue sould be ok. just toying with the idea maybe it will be only to test out the 80
622639,fish_fishburn,2011-09-18 22:00:00,1311,Better let me test it for you to make sure it's okay. What was it going on again?
622642,vinnimon,2011-09-18 22:07:00,2593,"  Will the stern handle the thrust from an 80 hp? Tempting as it can be, i would pass on it bud. You can always toy around with an 80 hp waterbug"
622650,fish_fishburn,2011-09-18 22:23:00,1311,"Starcrafts are a good boat. Give er a spin, just not W.O.T. from the get go. Experiment with placement of weight, if it has potential. Also play with the motor settings. Tweek everything,and if you like it, giver gas man. Just remember tethers, and a good P.F.D. I know this kinda stuff isn't for everybody, but I gotta thing for speed too."
622652,HTHM,2011-09-18 22:34:00,4082,Is the bigger motor a tiller as well? If so I would say too much HP. If you are converting to a console then maybe.
622655,skinny,2011-09-18 22:48:00,442,any motor can be a tiller you just need to add a handel
622656,glen,2011-09-18 22:51:00,2641,Have a welder on speed dial.  That's a good way to crack your transom.
622663,HTHM,2011-09-18 23:04:00,4082,  Glen does have a point it may result in a baroque transom.....
622664,walleyemen,2011-09-18 23:10:00,316,"The problem is the maxium h.p rating on the tag on the boat, if the police, mnr pull you over and see a 80 h.p on a 16 ft tiller guarantee they will check, as well as if you have a accident, and no insurance, if the boat is registered and 16 footer i,m sure by law it has to have at least liability insurance."
622665,irishfield,2011-09-18 23:13:00,26272,"In Canada there is no requirement to abide by the Max HP rating on the boat.  There is also no requirement in Canada to have insurance on a boat, although it's like playing russian roulette with 3 bullets in the gun."
622668,lookinforwalleye,2011-09-18 23:32:00,4399,"  I take it that means the 80 hp is not a tiller and your just gunna slap a handel on it, gunna slap a set of throttle cables on it too?  I say go for it   just make sure you do the following:  Have a camera boat following you taking video so when the torque rips the transom apart and you sink you have something to send America`s Funniest maybe some coin in it for you. Don`t have your family in the boat with you, make sure your insurance is paid up!"
622669,danbouck,2011-09-18 23:33:00,4380,No Tim!!! Make it look and run like new and sell it. Use that money for a 40
