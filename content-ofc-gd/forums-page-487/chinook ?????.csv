622540,chessy,2011-09-18 18:27:00,610,i was not there when my son caught this but it has a head like a pink.... but too big to be one .... what do you guys think  
622544,mike rousseau,2011-09-18 18:30:00,4661,now thats a beak...  the only time i ever saw a kipe like that it was on a brown... but i cant really see the colors of that fish at that angle....  somebody with more expertise will figure this one out im sure...
622546,TerryC,2011-09-18 18:33:00,196,Might be a COHO?  Clarence
622560,wallacio,2011-09-18 18:59:00,475,Coho for sure.
622563,dave524,2011-09-18 19:02:00,4508,yep buck Coho
622565,Spinpin,2011-09-18 19:03:00,12,identifying features from the pic....colors of gums and inverted upper jaw
622566,misfish,2011-09-18 19:09:00,29133,"Koho ya,but man ,is it early for these runs,or is it just me?"
622582,Fisherman,2011-09-18 20:07:00,7201,"Take a close look at the tailfin with the picture expanded, does nobody else see the spots on the lower half of the tail?"
622584,mike rousseau,2011-09-18 20:24:00,4661,Spots on the cheek as well
622586,solopaddler,2011-09-18 20:30:00,8605,Nice coho.
622589,misfish,2011-09-18 20:35:00,29133,  Mud?
622604,spoon,2011-09-18 20:55:00,74,Hoco salmon
622672,Familyfisherman,2011-09-18 23:39:00,188,Obviously one of the rare Chinohos we've all read so much about...  Good thing you released it...it would surely taste simply awful
622696,BillM,2011-09-19 01:15:00,17367,
622700,ChrisK,2011-09-19 01:26:00,2772,Be it a coho or a chinny that is one mean lookin kipe on that buck. Your son must of been proud to land that bad boy.
622794,Bob,2011-09-19 13:03:00,370,Maybe it's a pinook? These hybrids were first identified in the St Mary's River in 1992 and have characteristics of both pink and chinook but the white gums are typical. Not real common but they do show up where both pinks and chinooks spawn. What area was this fish caught in?
622816,tipupesox,2011-09-19 14:28:00,167,Coho .............
622819,myot,2011-09-19 14:49:00,131,Most of the Chinho's that have been caught are next impossible to tell with out genetic testing it seems like each year the New York DEC goes through this with a reported world record Coho.  BTW nice Coho  Dan
622835,12footspringbok,2011-09-19 15:36:00,459, Theres no doubt that there has been interspecies relations going on in the great lakes between salmonoids.  I've caught a couple over the years that didn't 100% meet the criteria of of species or another. Last fall my friend caught what I'm almost positive was a pinook on southern Gbay.
622857,chessy,2011-09-19 17:10:00,610,this fish was caught in the ganaraska river .. we used to have pink salmon runs years ago... but not in the last 15-20 years...  trying to get guy to send a bigger file of fish.. i was not there and am pissed was not.. . might be able to post a bigger picture of fish  
623050,Paulus,2011-09-20 02:01:00,522,"It's a coho for sure. Here's a slightly clearer pic of one from last year. The snout is pretty much the same.    Nice fish, though. Good catch!  p.-"
623273,chessy,2011-09-21 01:15:00,610,thanks guys
