Despite the lack of fish on Lac Seul this trip, it was still an awesome day off in beautiful NW Ontario....just what my soul needed.   I DECIDED TO TRY OUT MY UNDERWATER CAMERA HOUSING TODAY TOO....LOL....WITH MIXED RESULTS....BUT ITS A START!                     <iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/9s94EtV1daQ"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>     JUST AFTER TAKING THOSE SHOTS OF MY NEW GADGET, I NOTICED THE BAMBIS FEEDING WITH MUM OUTSIDE, ALWAYS COOL TO SEE.       FALL IS DEFINITELY HERE, THE CHICKENS WERE EVERYWHERE ON THE TRIP UP.         THE WIND HAD JUST STARTED TO PICK UP (CONTRARY TO THE WEATHER REPORT...SURPRISE SURPRISE) AS I ARRIVED AT THE LANDING.       I DECIDED TO TRY TROLLING CRANKS AFTER SEEING LOTS OF REPORTS ABOUT IT, NO LUCK, BUT NICE DAY TO CRUISE ABOUT FOR A COUPLE HOURS.        AFTER A WHOLE SERIES OF ISSUES THAT PUT A DENT IN MY INTENDED PLANS, I MANAGED ONLY 2 MORE WALLEYE (SMALL). BUT SOME NICE SIZED SMALLIES MADE UP FOR THAT.          GOT BACK TO THE LANDING AT DUSK...ONLY ONE OTHER CREATURE THERE, NOT LONG BEFORE HE'S GONE SOUTH NOW.         HERE IS THE VIDEO FROM THE DAY  <iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/idf0ZRC7E9E"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>"
