623558,johnnyb,2011-09-21 19:11:00,3413,"I wonder if the water has to be a certain temperature for the baits to release any of their potential holocaust-inducing contents?  Do they come out while the plastic is still in a firm state, or, is it basically a waterproof capsule of sorts that won't break down until it is melting?  Love the steelhead video btw!    "
623565,camillj,2011-09-21 19:39:00,1988,Jeeze if I knew that using minners would make my shlang bigger .. I'd a started years ago ... oh wait ... I only use minners !!!!!
623590,Jer,2011-09-21 20:58:00,1426,   So I guess it doesn't work then...
623594,jedimaster,2011-09-21 21:14:00,3472,  Wouldn't it be a good thing if fish spawned early in there lifecycle? What? Just sayin....
623619,GBW,2011-09-21 22:09:00,8460,I do NOT want to know how you know or where this could be going!
623242,whitbyboatguy,2011-09-20 22:54:00,130,"Plastics are known to leech toxins that cause various reproduction issues.  Especially soft plastics.  BPA is one of thos toxins that recently got a lot of publicity.  I know there is a lot of junk in the water already.  So with all the Senkos, Trigger-x etc. that gets put into the system every year (essentially now garbage)....what is the down side for the fish and other creatures that live there?"
623244,cjgraham,2011-09-20 23:12:00,104,I can't see too many of these making an impact. Most toxins predominantly settle to the bottom. The macro invertebrates and bottom feeders I would say are more at risk then anything
623245,mercman,2011-09-20 23:18:00,7054,I was under the impression that most soft plastic baits were bio-degradable and environment friendly.  edited to add  This looks like a thread that Garry2rs could help us answer.
623249,Whitespinnerbait,2011-09-20 23:42:00,2038,Don't worry about the little things in life
623251,cram,2011-09-20 23:45:00,1733,"It's a really good question.  Would eventually get into drinking water, albeit in tiny amounts."

623265,kickingfrog,2011-09-21 00:28:00,8333,One of the major Canadian mags had a piece about plastic baits IN fish just this spring. My intertnet is down so I can't find the link.
623266,lookinforwalleye,2011-09-21 00:43:00,4399,"Next time I catch a fish I`ll ask him if he`s not too tired from running that 52 km marathon,weigh-in,photograph!"
623270,mercman,2011-09-21 01:07:00,7054,  
623284,GBW,2011-09-21 01:28:00,8460,Yeah I read that too and it was the plastics made up to the last 2-3 years.  The new stuff does break down much better.  I keep a cup holder open in my boat for all 'dead' baits so they are not on the bottom.
623285,irishfield,2011-09-21 01:29:00,26272,Plugs the fishes ass up tight and they continue to eat and get big.... so catch 'em before they croak !
623295,Bob,2011-09-21 01:55:00,370,"I could be mistaken but I thought BPA was used to make plastic stiff so wouldn't be used in soft baits. Just another one of those things that radicals get riled about.  If it worries you, don't use them."
623301,cram,2011-09-21 02:08:00,1733,"Soft baits have (or at least used to have) a chemical called phthalates in them.  Not to sound like a ""radical"", but phthalates are a big deal.  Ever notice little girls going through puberty way younger these days?  Phthalates.  They do a lot of other bad things and are  about to be banned in children's toys in canada if htey aren't already.  Not sure how large a source fishing lures represent (assume it's tiny), but i wouldn't be just chucking them into the water if you can avoid it."
623304,camillj,2011-09-21 02:14:00,1988,"went snorkelling a few times this summer and came back with a handful of plastics that were conspicuously lying on bottom ... long after the hooks had rusted out.  Caught a 5lb laker in thye hardwater season .. and along with about 5 minnows in her belly was a 6"" Senko - partially digested ...  Just sayin"
623316,whitbyboatguy,2011-09-21 02:33:00,130,"  I check my fish for lead jigs etc in the belly. Have not found any yet but since the kids eat them too I am extra cautious.  Berkley won't say what is in Gulp...just that it is biodegradable AND who said phalates are a big deal? You are right, they are. : ) and according to this article they make up 50-80% of the bait:  http://www.recycledfish.org/blog/stewardship-tips/stewardship-tip-alternatives-to-soft-plastic-baits/  How many plastics are in a lake? Read the article. Personally, I bought some once and I feel bad about using them so I don't.....maybe I should sell them."
623319,whitbyboatguy,2011-09-21 02:39:00,130," BPA is used in making plastics that are clear, tough, pliable. The radicals are better informed than you. I am glad it was banned from MOST drinking containers (I think it is still in pop cans).  But if you want some a chemical that mimics estrogen (I don't know maybe you want a smaller unit and soft breasts) or you want you boys to grow up a little further on the feminine side....drink and eat all the foodstuffs lightly laced with BPA you can get your hands on. A little goes a long way from what I read."
623320,Dara,2011-09-21 02:40:00,3052,"  Ok, I'll bite...if your internet is down, how did you post this"
623321,Dara,2011-09-21 02:42:00,3052,  that would just put them straight into the water...how bout just not using them
623325,whitbyboatguy,2011-09-21 02:50:00,130, I think you came up with that thought after you hit your head on the wall.:  1) If they did not buy mine they would go to the store and buy them and put the same amount of them in the water. 2) By buying mine they don't use up the sources supply and the source would not need to make as many. Overall less plastics in the system.  Hey if I could not find a buyer that used them on a regular basis I would be happy.  found that In-Fisherman article someone mentioned: http://archives.in-fisherman.com/content/biodegradables-bass
623387,Rod Caster,2011-09-21 12:33:00,5784,"With all them boys wearing skinny jeans I often wonder if that is the direct result of smaller gonads.... definitly not much room in there for a full pack. Plus, how would they be able to run if a bear chased them with all that restriction. I agree with the OP, lets ban skinny jeans.     ... seriously, this makes a good case for using minnows and worms instead of plastics, which is basically what they try to replace. If you ever have to defend yourself to an ""articifial"" fisherman this is how it would go..  Artifical guy: you need live bait to catch fish? pffft you: Enjoy your tiny gonads buddy. Articial guy: you: That's right."

623496,bassmaster4,2011-09-21 16:09:00,801,i think that lost hard baits due to snags would pose a bigger problem
