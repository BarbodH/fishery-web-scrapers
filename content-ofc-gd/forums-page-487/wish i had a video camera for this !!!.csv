623517,fishindevil,2011-09-21 17:05:00,6254,"i was just on the 401 in ajax on the way to pickering on my lunch hour,and i was in the far right hand lane,just crossing duffins creek bridge and i seen 2 guys,litereally dragging a half decayed big very dead salmon down the shoulder of the highway....too funny....they looked like they were going to hitch hike too....too funny"
623520,asdve23rveavwa,2011-09-21 17:17:00,2690,"  Hopefully they try and eat it...one way to ""weed out"" the weak and stupid"
623521,Brettiop,2011-09-21 17:19:00,279,Yummmm!
623522,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2011-09-21 17:20:00,535,  Shore lunch! Just have to fight off the crows...
623523,bushart,2011-09-21 17:21:00,2628,I hear The white tail is the best part mmmmmm.
623526,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2011-09-21 17:29:00,535,"  The maggots add a lot of flavour too.     See, this is why I don't pick up hitchhikers, they always have a duffle bag full of rotten fish.....at least I hope it's fish."
623530,crappieperchhunter,2011-09-21 17:40:00,2582,My neighbor used to do that. Cept he was draggin the carcass home to bury under his  rose bushes. Musta worked his roses where beautiful. He used to try and convince me I should do that for my Asparagus patch. I did it once and concluded that the effort required was not worth it.
623532,ccmtcanada,2011-09-21 17:42:00,7971, I agree!  I don't like Asparagus...LOL.
623533,Raf,2011-09-21 17:44:00,3495,i'm guessing its headed for their garden  nobody is that hungry.
623535,adolson,2011-09-21 18:04:00,783," Wrap it in bacon and bake it for a bit, you'll change your mind! But then, that works for just about anything."
623536,ccmtcanada,2011-09-21 18:08:00,7971, That's because when you do that it becomes a bacon dish!
623538,solopaddler,2011-09-21 18:15:00,8605, Wanna bet.  Bank mutants love eating rotting flesh.
623540,mercman,2011-09-21 18:20:00,7054,You sure they weren't extremely tall raccoons?  
623569,camillj,2011-09-21 19:51:00,1988,I do ... but it makes my pee smell
623578,ctranter,2011-09-21 20:21:00,543,"I've seen entire families leave rivers with a shopping cart filled to their limit with some of the nastiest, blackest, rotting salmon that I've ever seen.  I asked, ""what are you going to do with those?"", to which the only reply I was given was ""...soup"".  I don't take pity on people that give themselves cancer."
623592,Harrison,2011-09-21 21:00:00,2202,"Forecast calls for rain, maybe they need boots."
623621,HTHM,2011-09-21 22:33:00,4082,"I saw Dave Mercer on the 407 today on my way home from work, does that count for anything?"
623649,mercman,2011-09-22 00:15:00,7054,   You guys kill me
623802,Beans,2011-09-22 14:04:00,3339, Hmmmmm...salmon flavoured asparagus...a whole new taste treat...  I stopped by last Sunday but Debbe said you were sleeping...didn't want to disturb you...I know how you need your beauty rest...   
623869,Fish4Eyes,2011-09-22 16:21:00,1022," It's true, its ridiculous how bad it smells. I pray people don't stand beside me at the urinal at work some days. They'd be thinking what the hell is wrong with this guy. Little do they know im on a mission to well being"
623890,mercman,2011-09-22 17:02:00,7054," I said to myself, ''Myself'' i said ''Remove asparagus from the list of foods i may eat someday.Don't want stinky pee''"
