Mine is to the point where the GPS is more or less useless for drifting. It gives me a MPH reading, so it is still seeing the satellite, but the cursor and the trail do not keep up. Any thoughts? Thanks, Jim"

623376,miller,2011-09-21 11:56:00,223,when you launch from the ramp start up your finder and give it a minute or two to get a solid lock before you start moving. other than that and updates i got no suggestions lol.
623378,scugpg,2011-09-21 11:59:00,1373,In the System settings there should be a spot where you can see how many satellites its locking on. maybe its not getting enough signal.  My first action would be make sure its up to date.
