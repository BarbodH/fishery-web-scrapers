High, green water brimming with fresh chinook made for an action-packed evening.  I managed at least a half-dozen or so beautiful chinook on bright coloured flies and jigs.    Throughout the trip, I kept noticing steelhead running and gunning between the chinook, and scored my first chromie of the year.  A FAT 23-24 incher.  Definitely the highlight of the trip.    Bring on the cold weather!  tight lines"
