623299,Bob,2011-09-21 02:05:00,370,Great lures.  Super action.  The light of my life and I have been getting some great pike and bass action on them this summer. I have a bunch of them left over from my charter fishing days on the North Channel of Huron. Latest update on their website is less than a week ago so they're still around.
