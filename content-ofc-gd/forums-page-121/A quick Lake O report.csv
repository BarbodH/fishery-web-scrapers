We are at one of the stressful times right now but what has made it rather fun is some of the people from around the globe that come to our work place to work on some of the specialised equipment. One such gentlemen is up from Arizona and working with him over the course of 2 weeks has been great so Bain (sleepsjigging) & I decide to take him out for some good old Canadian fun & fishing. We had a plan to take him up to Balsam Lake but plans changed due to me having to work so Bain took him to Simcoe & they caught various pan fish & some bass. So on the day I knew I wouldn't be involved at work we decided to take him out on the big blue & to say he is hooked is the understatement of the year. We were hoping to get into some Kings but they wouldn't play this day however the Bows showed up & put on some of the best acrobatic displays I've witnessed on the big lake. Just a fantastic day & wiped the stress away............ now back to the grind!

We picked through small 5 lb Chinook for a few hours then found some warmer and also danced with rainbows and cohos.  They sure are a Blast when they are smashing stuff in the top 25 fow,  we ad a bunch launch into the air 50 ft off the back of the boat before we knew they were hooked"
