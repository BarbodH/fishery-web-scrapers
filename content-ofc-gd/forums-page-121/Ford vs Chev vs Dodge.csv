975834,DRIFTER_016,2016-07-08 00:54:00,10439,The problem with drop in bed liners is that they move and eventually rub the paint away. If you have your vehicle oil sprayed or under coated the bed will still rust out from the top down if you don't take the liner out occasionally and touch up the areas where the rubbing is occurring. This is not an issue with a sprayed in bed liner.

The Tundra's rear end did the same kind of thing when going over the expansion joints on concrete roadways and bridges. Only way to stop it is to slow down. They changed body mounts on the Tundra to fix the issue. Don't think that will work on the 250 though.

FLEX  If you are paying cash then used might work out for you. However if you have to finance a large amount at all, buying used will probably cost you more per month as there won't be any 0% options for used...  Also finding a GOOD value used truck of any make is pretty tough around here when the U.S. dollar is so high. The good ones seem to go over the border the second they go on the market from here, or the private sellers want you to pay enough for them to drive a brand new truck, while you take over their problem child...."
974402,porkpie,2016-06-21 11:56:00,2521,"There is no such thing as 0 percent financing.  If you walk in and pay cash you will always get a better price than taking the 0 percent option.  No one lends money for free, it is just a marketing gimmick.  Very often the cash purchase price is enough to more than offset the financing cost of taking out a bank or credit union loan, because not everyone has 40k in their sock drawer."

I haven't owned a Ford, Dodge or Toyota, so I'm not going to put them down.  Good luck with whatever your do choose."
974459,grimsbylander,2016-06-21 20:58:00,3016,"Pointless thread. It's been debated on every forum since online forums were invented. Stating which truck is best is as dumb as saying which ones are crap. The big 3 roll 700,00 new trucks off the line each year, we buy one every 3 years...maybe, and that qualifies people to judge an entire industry. LOL  My perfect truck would have the style from one, the interior from another, the powertrain from yet another and the reliability from a fourth. Until that's possible, pick one you like the looks of and roll the dice...just like everyone else."

974467,DRIFTER_016,2016-06-21 21:51:00,10439,"YOU started posting complaints about Toyota or did you forget......  I only posted a positive showing Drifter that the Tundra he's thinking about getting crossed over the 1M mile mark. Tundra's do have issues like any other vehicle. You will find the most issues with the 1st and 2nd gen Tundras. The big issues were the frames rotting (recall), 2nd gen 5.7 air pump issues (warranty extended to 10 years), bed bounce in gen 2's due to too stiff a rear suspension (recall). Dodges have electrical, engine and transmission issues. GM's have electrical as well as some engine and brake issues. Ford's have differential, engine and suspension issues.  Don't know if the 150's do this but the 250's do and it looks like it sucks pretty bad.  "
974469,misfish,2016-06-21 22:01:00,29133,Ford has a recall out on brakes right now. Brake master cylinder and possible booster.
974483,dave524,2016-06-21 23:22:00,4508,That Ford F 250 death wobble looks identical to when the steering damper went south on my '68 VW Beetle
974213,FLEX ROD,2016-06-19 21:51:00,394,"Well as luck would have it my Toyota Highlander got totaled on me last week, yes I was in it but fortunately I walked out of it with just being banged up from the air bags, thank God.  So it is time to replace it, with the fact that I will probably be building a new house soon the idea of a pick-up is not that crazy, but I have never owned one I really don't have a clue on what to look for.  Not looking at new, probably 3 - 4 years old, I will need it to seat 4 and 4 wheel drive / not full time .  I really am lost in this department, I will drive all 3 tomorrow but would love to get some feed back as to what you folks have had and or have and what you would be looking at.  If I decide not to go this route, my decision will be really easy, Toyota Highlander here I come.  Help please, and many thanks in advance,  Thanks, FLEX"
974214,porkpie,2016-06-19 22:01:00,2521,"I'm running a 2010 f150 with a 4.6L since new.  It's been a pretty good truck.  Previous to that I had a 1997 Chevy with the 305.  Also a very good truck.  The only weak spot I've heard of from other ford owners is the occasional blown tranny.  Happened to a buddy of mine on an 06, and I've heard of it happening to a friend of my main fishing buddy, apparently that was an 09.  Otherwise they seem to run pretty well.  The dodge sure does look nice, but I know nothing about them.  Ford or Chev are pretty solid though!  If you have the driveway space, go for the 6.5 foot box (ford) or whatever Chevy offers as the mid length box.  I can get a full size atv in mine with the gate closed.  Make sure you get running boards!"
974215,Old Ironmaker,2016-06-19 22:09:00,8243,"I am so happy you weren't injured badly. Now I have owned all 3 pick ups. I am a Chevy Silverado guy. I bought my first brand new for me vehicle from a dealer in 2011. A Chev Silverado. The same F 150 was $15,000.00 more, same for the Ram. I am a best value for my money kind of guy. In my opinion the Chevy was the best value. I now have 95,000 K on it and it runs and looks like new. My next door neighbour Jim bought his F 150 the same year and he paid over 17K more for it than I paid for my Chevy. He has more bells and whistles that he never uses than my Silver Bullet. It runs well but not 17K more well. I didn't even look at the Dodge Ram as a very close friend has a 2009 and is going on his 3rd tranny. I chose the crew cab full 4 door with a smaller box because I am kind to my passengers, tons of rear leg space. I love my Chevy. Plus from the money I saved I bought a 19 foot StarCraft with a 115 Mariner. I had it before I bought the truck. I can't even feel it behind my Chev. It's the small block 8, 4.8, but I have no complaints. I did the mileage thing last month and am getting 13 without the boat and 15 Lts/100 K towing, not bad I think as my wife's Altima gets 9 LTS/100K. It doesn't have the on board fuel calculator but for 15K savings I can use my dollar store calculator.  Good luck shopping."
974218,leaf4,2016-06-19 22:14:00,2466,"If you plan on renovations definitely get a 6.5' or full 8' box, you'll see generally everything is at least 8 feet in length and depending on what else you'd be getting into (structural) longer than 8.  As far as brand goes for me its a no brainer to get an f-150, I know a lot of old Chevy's that cost a looottt of money. The girlfriend works at a Chev dealership and just last week there was an 09 Silverado with 131,000km needed a new engine all customer pay they didn't goodwill any of it"
974219,GBW,2016-06-19 22:24:00,8460,"Um,keep this in mind (below)...  I have a 2007 Ram and other than my recent breaking system issues (all fixed now) it's been good.  I'd still consider Toyota and Nissan trucks too if going all in on a newer one... https://youtu.be/BTm2F4ysQrE"
974220,davey buoy,2016-06-19 22:29:00,5505,"I am a ford guy,neighbour bought the club cab and a 8' box.That is one big truck lol.4 wheel and nice tires/rims.I have room for one,but how many do?.Good luck on what you buy!!!!That was a F150 The 6' with the tail gate down would be 8' I would guess,that would do?."
974221,Fisherman,2016-06-19 23:18:00,7201,"Had 2 GM's never buy another along with 3 brand new ones at work that I'll unfortunately have to drive.  ATV is more comfortable.  Ford, like riding on a bloody milk crate.  Last 2 are RAMs and wouldn't hesitate to buy another.  Toyotas may be reliable but they are no where near economical.  I'm over 30 MPG with the current ECODiesel."
974222,Terry,2016-06-19 23:27:00,14456,"I wanted a chev but they were way out of my price range checked out ford and ram, the ford was 7000.00 more for the same features as the ram ..the ford dealer kept saying apple and oranges but he couldnt tell me why . he did say over and over that the f150 is the best selling truck I went with ram and so far I love it and have not had any problems....touch wood...lol"
974225,Gallie,2016-06-19 23:46:00,1215,"I got a 2016 f150 xlt 5.0l and i love it, great mileage,smooth ride,and tons of power. As for the aluminum i guess you shouldnt throw toolboxes in on their corner lol. My buddy has had his 2014 ram 1500 for a couple years and he beats the crap out of it, has had some shifting problems and noise coming from the tranny but dealer says its nothing lol. Other than that its been pretty good to him. Chevs are great if you can afford them and dont mind the tires breaking off?"
974226,Dutch01,2016-06-20 00:03:00,1431,"I have a 2015 Silverado LT and I love it.  The small bock 5.3 has loads of power and torque, and it rides like a dream on the highway."
974227,chris.brock,2016-06-20 00:11:00,4053,"Dumb video with the cinder blocks being dropped. Aluminum with a drop in bed liner is the way to go.  Sounds like you need a vehicle ASAP, but if you could get by somehow until the late fall, the remaining 2016's get price slashed when the 2017's are out."
974228,Dutch01,2016-06-20 00:15:00,1431,The Chevy uses a lot more high strength steel than the ford and only weighs about 200 pounds more. I think the aluminum hype is a bit gimmicky.
974229,DRIFTER_016,2016-06-20 00:19:00,10439,I wouldn't buy any of them. I've had Ford and GM vehicles and my folks have had a few Dodges. I owned 1 GM and that was all it took to put me off them for life. Dodges are crap too. Lot of electrical and tranny issues. Fords are the best of the bunch but I still wouldn't buy one. I will be replacing my current vehicle in a couple of years and will be getting a pick up. A Tundra!!!!
974231,Freshtrax,2016-06-20 00:49:00,2215,My 2010 supercrew ford has been   bulletproof and its been to hell and back.  165 k so far no major repairs. Average 14l/100

974247,Joeytier,2016-06-20 09:50:00,3990,"They're all good, and they're all pieces of junk  I have a 13 Sierra, 64 k hard kms (harder than what most trucks see in a lifetime) and all I've had happen is a blown lightbulb.  I don't give 2 craps about anything other than reliability and 4x4 capability though, which my Sierra has in spades.  There's no clear winner.  If you're coming from a highlander, then your lifestyle probably doesn't require an overly tough, rugged machine so just about any of the models out there would fit the bill for you.  Try em out and pick what ya like best."

Some how I knew that this was going to happen, that I would have feed back on all 3 and be scratching my head at the end of it all   .  I will be driving them today but my gut without sitting in one was right off the bat was to go to the F150, will see how it feels. As I do need to get one quite quickly time is an issue so I hope that I will have a better idea later on today...... stay tuned for more questions.  Thank you,  FLEX"
974252,DanD,2016-06-20 11:26:00,2223,"It's to bad AMC was gobbled up by Chrysler. They use to take the best of the ""big three"" and build bullet proof drive-trains, suspension and brakes. It just to bad they couldn't keep the bodies from rusting apart on those Jeep pick ups. I think you'll likely turn away from this suggestion; but what about a full sized van? No you're not going to get 4X4; but I think they are a lot more versatile. Cargo or passenger with removable seats; you'll have the most secure (out of sight of of mind) and weather proof, people/cargo hauler. A buddy of mine went that route with a Chev G10 that has the 4.8 Vortec. No problems pulling his boat and he's rigged up a rack, that all is rods are hung off the ceiling of the van; no more stepped on broken tips. If your want of 4X4 is trouble free boat launching; I helped him weld up a 2"" receiver to the front of the van. If he's at an iffy ramp, he connects the boat trailer to the front of the van; now his drive wheels are high and dry and he's never admitted to getting stuck? LOL  As for which manufacturer; everyone has their own issues with their fleet of trucks. Research what those issues are and whether there is a maintenance schedule that can be followed to prevent that issue from happening. Chev 4X4 for example; are/were famous for chewing up front differential carrier bearings. The fix; change the diff oil every 25K and the bearings will last forever; well almost. LOL  Dan."
974255,Terry,2016-06-20 12:04:00,14456,It's funny how many people  say their truck is the greatest but the only way they defend it is by putting down the other makes.  And still have nothing good to say about their truck
974257,BillM,2016-06-20 12:12:00,17367,"Each of the big 3 have their issues.  Although if you're looking at new, I don't think you can go wrong with either of them."
974258,dave524,2016-06-20 12:41:00,4508,"As a long time pickup owner and home owner, I'm sold on staying with an SUV type vehicle with a good trailer hitch and getting a landscape trailer with box at least an inch bigger than a sheet of plywood and capacity to handle a yard of crushed stone or topsoil. Works way better for me.  edit: I don't worry about the box on the trailer, had a front end loader dump lots in it like in the commercial. Occasional coat of tremclad and all is good. The load height is also a lot better for shoveling off a load of topsoil to a wheel barrow than constantly climbing up into a pickup and being able to drop your load and unload at your convenience is nice. Just saying but I guess a guy needs at least 1 pickup in his life, I did."
974259,FLEX ROD,2016-06-20 12:47:00,394,"Unfortunately I am not looking at new, I would like to keep it under 25k pre tax and see what that gets me age and option wise.  But first I have to figure out which truck first and then start price shopping, I do not want the price to dictate rather reliability and comfort and  then price.  FLEX"

974281,Bernie,2016-06-20 15:12:00,3190,"Worked on them all. As far as the ""big three"" are concerned, find the best deal that you are happy with and drive it. They all can be awesome and all can be miserable lemons. Yes even imports can have issues, but are generally more reliable. Last long term pickup for me was a 96 Ford. Cost virtually nothing in repairs over 10 years I owned it. 280,000 km. Was a deal so I bought it. Currently run a 2006 Chev with a 6 litre engine. Again it was a deal so I bought it. I love the power and the Allison 6 speed trans. Not too bad on fuel as long as you stay off the hard throttle."
