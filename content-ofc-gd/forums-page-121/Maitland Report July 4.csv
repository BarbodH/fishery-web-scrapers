975648,Old Ironmaker,2016-07-05 20:19:00,8243,Did you leave any for us Dave? Too windy for me yesterday plus my body was done after going 0 for 2 Sunday out of Nanticoke and taking a good pounding coming back in after we trolled all the way from the creek to my place. We did get a few nice Smallies in front of the cottage though in 15 feet of water bouncing tubes. Way to go Dave.

Nice trip and they look to be about a 3 lb. average.  Got me too!  I kept wondering about the two guys and 12 hrs , 16 walleye - wasn't adding up somehow - glad you noticed it so I could go back and (with glasses on) see it too - great job on both the catch and blending the photos!   Gotta love all that!  Michael"

Johnny, It was our lucky day. over 12 hours in the sun and those dam bugs was brutal, my buddy is suffering today, his face has all blistered."

975735,Joeytier,2016-07-06 19:25:00,3990,"Beauty!  Walleye for days, there.  Your neighbors must like you."
975753,Old Ironmaker,2016-07-06 22:54:00,8243,"Luckily no bugs here so far, Bruce is loaded with them buggers. I have never been bit by the May Flies, what were they that they bit?  As far as size, a 5 pound Pic here is a small one and I agree 100% the smaller the sweeter. This must be the only fishery where we hope the Walleye is a small one which would be 5 pounds. My smallest last year was 8."
