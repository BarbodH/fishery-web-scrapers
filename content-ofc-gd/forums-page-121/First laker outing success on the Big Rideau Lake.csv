And it didn't take long to get hot, thankfully there was a nice wind to keep it bearable.  Ian and I launched out of Murphys point and started jigging on one of my favorite spots but the fish just didn't seem to be interested. So, we moved to spot B. Wasn't long before Ian had this nice 6lb Laker on and man did it give up an awesome fight on his light tackle. I'm guessing but it was at least 5 -7 minutes of dogging and runs. He was pumped.    We started to jig some more but it wasn't long before I suggested a switch to downrigging. Not 20 min later this pig slammed a 3.5"" Mooselook spoon. Not quite the fight of Ians but when it came into view there was some wooohooo's all around. 10 lb 11 oz piggie.    Then it got hot, stupidly hot, and we left! Happy but we left. "
