Someone's been charged.  http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/moose-riders-youtube-fort-nelson-1.3660913?cmp=rss    A year after a video was posted to YouTube showing a man riding a moose, two Fort St. John, B.C., men have been charged under the Wildlife Act. The video, shot from a motor boat, caused an uproar on social media. It shows a moose being chased across a shallow body of water, before a man jumps onto the animal and rides it for 15 seconds before falling off. Others on the boat can be heard laughing.  In a Facebook post Thursday, the Conservation Officer Service says that a yearlong investigation has led to two suspects being charged with three counts, including harassing wildlife, attempting to capture wildlife and hunting big game while the animal is swimming. The men were tracked down after the body of water in the video was identified as Tuchodi Lakes near Fort Nelson. The men — who were not named — are due to appear in court in Fort Nelson on Aug. 8."

975474,Bernie,2016-07-03 21:25:00,3190,Last week while standing on my dock I was watching a mallard with her little ones cross from one island to another. A pontoon boat came along with a group of young males aboard. The spotted the ducks and veered to run them over. They turned to late to hit them and turned around to chase. I yelled loud enough that they heard me and stopped the chase. They took off. I watched which way they headed to find out where they were staying. I hopped in the boat and caught up with them. I then could see the camp name in the boat. I went and spoke with camp owner so he could speak with them about it. Said they were from the Toronto area. Why do people do stuff like that. They were all old enough to know better.
975477,Fisherman,2016-07-03 23:11:00,7201,Why do people do stuff like that. They were all old enough to know better. Because their fathers never kicked their butts hard enough.  Bunch of loosers.
