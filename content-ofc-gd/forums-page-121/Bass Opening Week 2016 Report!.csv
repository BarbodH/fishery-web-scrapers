The bass were somewhat challenging at times early in the trip however although numbers were not the case early on I was finding decent fish and as the week progressed I found more fish exploring new water. Punching matted cover was the key this trip most of the time. Using a bully grass devil a black and blue punch skirt and a 1oz weight i just picked apart thicker matts under the hot sunny conditions. In the mornings we used a topwater walk the dog style bait and managed to catch smallies daily even creating a flurry one morning putting 4 in the livewell in 10 minutes. Enjoy the pictures my dad managed to get his first smallie this trip of a decent size so that was exciting for him. As well my uncle caught his first nice largemouth on a flipping jig and bait caster.  Day 1 was a grind boat traffic was wild to say the least for north eastern ontario, regardless I caught little fish all morning and then once the sun got high I got this nice largemouth from under a matt.
