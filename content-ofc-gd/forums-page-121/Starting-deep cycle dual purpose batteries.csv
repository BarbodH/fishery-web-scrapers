975748,mike rousseau,2016-07-06 22:49:00,4661,Hey gang  Due to a great friend I was able to upgrade my trolling motor from an edge 50 12v to a maxxum 70 24v  I want 2 smaller deep cycles but the size 24 at canadian tire are dual purpose  Will 2 of these do the trick?  Or do I have to get 2x 27s?  Suggestions please  Thanks
975757,Raf,2016-07-06 23:35:00,3495,The 24 size will not last very long before needing recharging  Plus I've had poor luck with that particular model 24 size duAL purpose.  2 batteries in 4 years.  I used it as my starting and graph \ lights battery.
975764,ecmilley,2016-07-07 00:59:00,2163,True dc will be much better for that application. Moving up to 27 series usually involves. Nothing more.than a couple battery trays. You may want to upgrade the circuit breakers for the trolling motor
975765,mike rousseau,2016-07-07 01:02:00,4661,Even the size 27 are dual purpose at CT now

You may want to upgrade the circuit breakers for the trolling motor  Actually, a 24v motor will draw less current than a 12v motor.  If he had a proper breaker for the old motor, it should be fine for the new setup.  "
975771,Bondar,2016-07-07 01:49:00,817,I've been using the ever starts from Walmart for 2 seasons now with no issues they've been great but I have 2 group 29. And I use a 27 for my starting and electronics
975774,ecmilley,2016-07-07 10:05:00,2163,You may have to ask at ct for them to order in dc batterys. But is there a walmart or costco in the area. Or carquest all carry dc batterys
975780,captpierre,2016-07-07 12:47:00,2521,Don't forget Costco.
975782,Sinker,2016-07-07 13:24:00,8692,"Go to a proper battery shop and get a real deep cycle battery. The costco batts are good too, if you can find them.  S."

975787,grimsbylander,2016-07-07 13:50:00,3016,I've had good luck with a dual purpose battery but ONLY for starting and electronics. Do as suggested above...make the effort to switch to group 27's and you'll never have an issue. My outboard died once and I went from the mouth of the Upper Niagara to Crystal Beach on MAX. Still had time so we fished the inner bay for another hour. 36V from group 27's. No such thing as too much when it comes to you batteries.

975815,mike rousseau,2016-07-07 21:05:00,4661,Breaker?  No breaker... Wire through a plug direct to the battery
975816,mike rousseau,2016-07-07 21:06:00,4661,Yes there is a Walmart... I'll try there first as I get a discount
975819,John Bacon,2016-07-07 21:17:00,3277,"Breaker?  No breaker... Wire through a plug direct to the battery  A circuit breaker is recommended.  However, I did go for about 14 years without one on my old boat without a problem.  If you are re-wireing anyway; you might as well do it right and include a breaker."
975830,mike rousseau,2016-07-07 23:35:00,4661,Oh ok  Been using trolling motors for 20 years without  I didn't know people used em  I'll look into that
975831,Bernie,2016-07-07 23:46:00,3190,In the event of a short circuit without a fuse or breaker is a receipe for disaster. The only way to escape a fire on a boat is to jump in the water.
