976031,John Bacon,2016-07-10 01:02:00,3277,"The TRCA is seeking input on the proposed water front project which runs from Bluffers Park to Highland Creek.The deadline for the current round of input is July 12th.  If you are a shore angler who would like to have them include some fishing nodes; or, a boat angler who like them to include some boat access (I have had to turn around a leave Bluffers without launching because there was no parking), then you have a few days to let them know.There had been consideration for a full marina on the scale of Bluffers Park.  But that has been shelved because Bluffers currently has vacancies.  They also cancelled plans for a small boat launch near Highland Creek because of access issues.  Personally, I am going to suggest a boat launch near the Guild Inn.https://trca.ca/conservation/green-infrastructure/scarborough-waterfront-project/public-consultation/  https://trca.ca/conservation/green-infrastructure/scarborough-waterfront-project/"
