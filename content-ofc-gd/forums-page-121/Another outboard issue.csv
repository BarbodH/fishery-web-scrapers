Ran at WOT for extended periods  Went to start my motor at the last spot and nothing... No slow turn or anything... And my trim wouldn't work...  Ended up getting it started with a rope and when I touched the trim button the motor shut down  Got off the water and when I got to the gas station the trim worked again so I turned the key to see if it would turn over and nothing... Then the trim wasn't working again either  I checked all the fuses already  Sonar is reading 12.4 I think... And first dip when I turn the key or try to trim... All my pumps are powered fine...  When I turn the key halfway to the ""run"" position I can hear some faint noises so there is power getting in  Any suggestions?  Thanks  Mike"

975546,Gallie,2016-07-04 22:17:00,1215,"Sounds like it could be a loose wire or a ground issue. Just went through this on my big boat. Also check the cables going to and from your battery for corrosion or damage, a cable could even have loosened off a bit. Hopefully some of the mechanically inclined can help a bit more. You could use a tester to check for the amount of juice you are getting to your starter, just because you are getting power doesnt mean you are getting enough to turn it over. Good luck mike"

975548,misfish,2016-07-04 22:23:00,29133,Cool video Dave.  Now I want to fish with this guy.LOL
975553,mike rousseau,2016-07-04 23:13:00,4661,"Got it down to a battery issue  Jumped my truck to my outboard cables and everything worked  My battery connections are tight... Clean... And coated in electrical grease...  Gunnar test my battery.., it's only 14 months old"
975557,ecmilley,2016-07-04 23:45:00,2163,Yes test your battery regardless of age to start. Then if.u.have a multimeter i suggest you start by gigling all wires for a loose condition then if the checks.out start voltage drop testing
975558,ecmilley,2016-07-04 23:45:00,2163,Start at your solenoid bat+ the trim should get its power from there too
975560,Gallie,2016-07-05 00:14:00,1215,"For what its worth i wont use any sort of grease on electrical connections any more, it gets dirty and becomes more of a detriment than anything else."
975577,wdodgetruck,2016-07-05 01:53:00,27,Also check the volts when the engine is running . should have 13 + volts .
975579,DRIFTER_016,2016-07-05 01:55:00,10439,Also check the volts when the engine is running . should have 13 + volts .  Should be about 14.2 volts running.
975596,dave524,2016-07-05 10:59:00,4508,"Seeing it worked all day and failed late in the day, maybe look at the alternator, could not be charging and the battery was down from not being kept up."
