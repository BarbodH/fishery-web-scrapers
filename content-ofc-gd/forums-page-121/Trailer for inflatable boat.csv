975874,DanD,2016-07-08 13:37:00,2223,"Try Kijiji. There's usually a number of them for sale.  Like the one below; found it on the first page of 247 hits, when I searched utility trailer.  http://www.kijiji.ca/v-cargo-utility-trailer/london/12-foot-utility-trailer/1179970111?enableSearchNavigationFlag=true  Size wise it would fit the bill; strength wise, probably more then you'd likely need?

975907,mamona,2016-07-08 17:26:00,597,Thank you for ideas guys Regarding Kijiji (haven't checked CT yet): for $900-$1000 I can have brand new EZ Loader http://www.ezloader.com/adjustable/trailers/personal-watercraft/  I thought it is just too much considering my needs and value of the boat
975911,Old Ironmaker,2016-07-08 18:31:00,8243,We have several small trailers at the shop yard that would fit the bill. Our gang bought several boats to repair/flip or to part out and a few had trailers that were swapped out by the original owners are too small for the boats that came with them. PM me if you wish. Location is west of Dunnville if you are interested.
975974,GBW,2016-07-09 03:11:00,8460,I have one that holds my 14' tinny and can hold a 10 and 12' zodiac as I had a 10' one and sold it.  trailer is located in the Fenelon Falls area and will tell you a price and condition over the weekend if interested.
