975592,ONbuckhunter,2016-07-05 04:34:00,39,"Dark Coloured swim jig, and a dark coloured spinner.  Pitch till you puke, and work weed flats with a spinnerbait or a swimbait and you should run across some buckets.  The lake is full of them.  Its mostly a smallmouth lake but still lotsa big buckets all over the lake."
