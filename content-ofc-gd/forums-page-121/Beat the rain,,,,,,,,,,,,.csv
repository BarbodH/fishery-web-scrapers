Unload and fished for 3 hours. Lots of pound and a half fish. Lost a a nice tank. Knocked it off with the net. No matter, managed about 30 fish in the limited time. A few pics. Good mix bag lake. A fun lake to fish.    Just park and slip the toon in and go fishing. Everything on the white spinner bait. BOOYHA.          "

975358,misfish,2016-07-01 20:55:00,29133,Thanks fellas.  Was well worth the early rise. I was to have breaky with the parents in the morning. Figured I had a few hours to get a fish in before then. Me pops an early riser aswell. I was on the lake at 5ish. He texted me at 5:30. Breaky is ready. LOL  He kept things warm til I got off the lake.
