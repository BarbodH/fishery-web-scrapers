I've read all about the rocks, so I'll be trying to maximize the time on the electric motor for sure. Can anyone tell me if one launch is better than the rest, as far as being closer to the best fishing areas? No point having to drive farther than I need to and risk dinging the lower unit...."
975237,Tom McCutcheon,2016-06-30 20:19:00,627,The launch on Gilchrist Bay (Little's Marina?) is about mid way point of the lake. It isn't a bad launch and I think it is $10.00. I can't comment on other launches as I have never used those.
975251,Dutch01,2016-06-30 22:19:00,1431,"Awesome, thanks Tom. I'll look into that one further."

Cheapest launch on the lake, and a decent launch in a sheltered bay, Carveths will be close to 25.00 with launch and parking, not sure about McCrakens but i assume close to the same pricing as Carveths, lots of opportunities for all species in Gilchrist Bay, and some great deep water humps once out of Gilchrist Bay, with a 18 foot hump just after you exit Gilchrist Bay"

975435,Dutch01,2016-07-03 02:13:00,1431,Got it! Thank you.  I paid $10 to Launch and park today which is reasonable imo. $25.00 is pretty crazy.
