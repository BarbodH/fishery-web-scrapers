975571,hunteronwheels,2016-07-05 01:23:00,112,ok so last year i started using low profile casting reels now i am looking for a lefty 5 to 1 reel hard to find now my question is is casting a round reel the same as a low profile or will i need to spend a month in the backyard learning to cast it ( with a pair of scissors lol )
975575,supercharged115,2016-07-05 01:49:00,8,I use the Abu Garcia C3 with the left hand reel and never had a problem....set your tension with every bait you put on and cast away...the only issue I have is casting into the wind and just adjust less spool tension for that....great reel though!

975636,AKRISONER,2016-07-05 17:24:00,5558,no difference what so ever...in fact casting my big C3 is way easier than casting my low pro curado.
975637,dave524,2016-07-05 17:35:00,4508,"no difference what so ever...in fact casting my big C3 is way easier than casting my low pro curado.  exactly, now if you are talking about the old Langley's and Inglis/Shakespeare's , round endplate, direct drive , knuckle dusters I learned on you may want to bring the scissors"
975638,bow slayer,2016-07-05 17:36:00,1074,"I prefer my round reels to my low profile ones,I have a shimano Calcutta TE200DC  that not one of my low profiles can touch ease and distance wise."

975708,hunteronwheels,2016-07-06 13:03:00,112,cool thanks for the info
975731,musky_hunter,2016-07-06 18:17:00,328,love them round reels...  
975750,Smokercrafty,2016-07-06 22:50:00,227,I think you get the idea. No difference at all. Just more of a challenge tossing lighter baits against the wind. (With either style) I enjoy my Cardiff over my low pro though.
975796,hunteronwheels,2016-07-07 15:38:00,112,ok thanks all you convinced me round reel it is
