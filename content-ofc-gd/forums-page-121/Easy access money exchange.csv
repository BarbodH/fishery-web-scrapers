975503,John Bacon,2016-07-04 16:26:00,3277,Are you converting U.S.$ to Cdn$?  I think that any bank branch can do that.
975506,seanik,2016-07-04 16:38:00,38,"We will be converting US$ to Cdn$, Looking for an exchange place not far off our route with decent rates. Also would be great if we could buy non-resident fishing license close to exchange.  Seanik"
975507,aplumma,2016-07-04 16:46:00,6896,Fishing licences can be purchased on line here you need the sportsman card as well  https://www.ontario.ca/page/fishing-licence-non-residents-canada  Any bank in the US will order cash but it is not usually  on hand so allow a day or two. Check with any major airport as well they have it on hand.   Art
975509,OhioFisherman,2016-07-04 16:59:00,6623,"Like Art says, just from days of old, most bank branches didn't have enough Canadian cash on hand. In smaller towns and burbs here stateside it is even more of a problem finding Canadian cash, most I dealt with would get it for you.  An auto club location might have some ideas? Do people still use travelers checks?"
975511,John Bacon,2016-07-04 17:19:00,3277,"It may be easier to make the exchange in Canada.  All Canadian banks will have Cdn$ on hand; and I would think they will all accept US$.  I am not if there will be an issue for a U.S. resident who doesn't have an account with the bank.Any large town or city will also have specially exchange centres.  They may have better rates than the bank; but you would probably need to be exchanging quite a bit of money to make the rate difference worth going out of your way to find one.  You could get your money exchanged at Pearson Airport; but that will be a pain to get in an out; and they probably won't give you a good rate.  p.s. Many stores, etc. will accept US$.  They may not give you a good rate though."

975514,Rich Clemens,2016-07-04 17:37:00,3131,"Duty free is the only one directly along your route.  Used to be one along the QEW at St Catherine's, but I think it has closed down.    Maybe someone else knows for sure.    Canadian banks will exchange currency and you may get a little better rate than duty free.  Unfortunately, duty free in the US side has limited parking if you are towing a boat.   Couple times in the past, I could find no parking and went on to St Catherine's.   I have been buying my Canadian fishing licenses online as Art suggested.    I print off a couple copies, in case one gets lost or damaged.  I keep en extra copy in the boat and one in the truck.    Also save off a copy as a PDF and have it in my email - Just in case.  Maybe overkill, but I dont want to have to buy another one"
975515,Rich Clemens,2016-07-04 17:40:00,3131,"We have also exchanged US for Canadian funds at local banks and never had an issue.   Some places may want some form of ID, so I just take along my passport.   You should have no issue doing this.   Many lodges accept US currency and give a fair exchange as well.  Good luck"

975520,John,2016-07-04 18:09:00,2956,You will aways get the best possible exchange rate by using either debit or credit cards to purchase the majority of items. Bank cash exchange rates are marked up 2-3% minimum. Carry maybe $100 in Canadian currency just in case. Don't use currency exchanges or you will get royally ripped.
975521,Dusky,2016-07-04 18:19:00,310,"Once you get off from 407 to 400, you can get next exit for Vaughn Mills mall. Mall is on your way not a detour. At Vaughn Mills you can get your fishing licence at Bass Pro and can exchange money at Calforex Currency Exchange (their rates are usually better comparing to major banks)."
