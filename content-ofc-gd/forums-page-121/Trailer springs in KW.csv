975047,porkpie,2016-06-28 02:31:00,2521,"One of my leaf springs is done, so I'm going to be changing both out.  Looking for a good spring shop in kitchener/ waterloo or even better anywhere north of KW.  I know I can get leafs at princess auto but I'd rather deal with an independent spring shop if possible.  Time is of the essence, I leave for north bay on Monday.  Thanks for input!"

975167,porkpie,2016-06-29 20:23:00,2521,"Well if anyone needs a spring job done in the KW area, I can reccomend First Class spring and suspension in Breslau.  I was tied up with a brake job and serpentine belt on my truck at home and didn't figure i'd have time to replace the springs on my trailer.  They did the job quickly and for exactly what they quoted.  I was pretty pleased!"
