Been disappointed at the lack of flavour coming from gas grills. Have considered going back to a Weber kettle charcoal grill So I listened to the Traeger pitch. Sounded too good to be true. $1000. And the sale is over in 2 days. $200 more anywhere else. I never buy anything major without research. Whipped out the phone and snooped around for comments.  Most  rediculously positive. Have to buy expensive hardwood pellets but the results are great and easy. Pulled the trigger. Figured with Costco's return policy can always bail. Anybody have any experience with Traeger smokers?"

I have eaten a metric crap ton of smoked stuffed jalapeños and various other poppers and tasty good stuff.  Everything has been fantastic, but I have no idea how easy it is to operate as I'm usually half lit by that time of the night.  The food tastes great though!!"

HAHAHAHA  I just checked out the web site and all units look to be built well and have a good design.  If I was in the market I'd consider one.  I do have a buddy who has a big green egg unit (2x the big and the small) and swears by those units.  The Treager looks like less less effort / work to make a nice smoked / cooked meal then the Egg though."
