I am hoping to do a fair bit of fishing.  Has anyone fished it before? I've head it's fairly decent for small mouth?  Any suggestions?  I am planning on renting a canoe at the park, pretty sure that  means I won't be able to fish early mornings.  If anyone is local and wants to rent me a canoe, I'd be very grateful and jump all over it.  Thanks in advance for the feed back!  Bret"

If it works the same as other parks, once you rent it it's yours 24/7 until you return it.  And according to the park web site, Mayflower Lake, behind the office, is stocked with rainbows."
