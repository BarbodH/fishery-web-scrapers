975519,PUMP KNOWS,2016-07-04 17:53:00,937,Here's one we caught on the weekend  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhG9WD9xagg
975522,PUMP KNOWS,2016-07-04 18:25:00,937,"Always wanted to fly fish them, haven't got around to it yet. I usually fish them in the pin.  Carp on the pin is fun too.  Just put on the clicker and wait.  Nice catches!"

969803,PUMP KNOWS,2016-05-16 00:21:00,937,Here's my first carp of the year...    Caught using a boilie with a fake imitation corn on a hair rig.  Feel free to post your carp pics here. 
969862,Dutch01,2016-05-16 15:53:00,1431,We were fishing for perch/walleye on Saturday when my Bro-in-law hooked into this one:      It put up a heck of a fight on a medium light rod with 6# test!
969874,Mike Pike,2016-05-16 16:47:00,1332,I want one!  My one expedition went unrewarded last week.  Congratulations guys.

969934,Locnar,2016-05-16 20:48:00,645,"I caught the laziest carp ever last week. It was a fair size, about 30"" and probably 12lbs, and didn't go for a single run. Just some lazy meandering and half assed swimming around. I was wondering if they've started spawning and it was tired? Or if it was an unhealthy fish? All the other carps I've caught in the same spot have been brawlers."

970217,Dutch01,2016-05-18 17:36:00,1431,"Thanks, but that was my Bro-in-law. I was not so lucky - at that spot. We moved spots and I had walleye for breakfast the next day, so all's well that ends well!"
970283,Ron,2016-05-19 02:16:00,1683,No shortage of them in some areas!   My first mirror. 
970284,Fisherpete,2016-05-19 02:19:00,1814,I'll have some pics to add after this weekend ?
970448,MJL,2016-05-20 17:33:00,2427,"Did my first carp trip of the year yesterday. Was slower than what I'm used to for this time of year but got into some nice fish. Ended the day by taking a selfie.LOL  Carp Selfie by Mike Leung, on Flickr  "
970452,Mike Pike,2016-05-20 17:56:00,1332,Now THAT'S a selfie!  Billiant shot Mike!
970854,PUMP KNOWS,2016-05-24 14:26:00,937,Nice pic Ron!  I still need to catch my first mirror.  MJL - Sweet pic!

970868,MJL,2016-05-24 16:46:00,2427," Special camera for that effect?  Or is it an attachment/selfie stick for any camera?  Amazing photo!  For most of my underwater photography, I use a Canon 7D DSLR + Canon 8-15mm f/4L fish-eye lens in an underwater housing. In this case, I was just holding the camera housing in my left hand and holding the fish with my right. I also used a pistol shutter attachment to make pressing the shutter button easier. Here's a pic of my housing (without the pistol attachment).  "
970894,PUMP KNOWS,2016-05-24 17:41:00,937,I always wondered how they were done.  Thanks for sharing  PB from the long weekend  
970920,Mike Pike,2016-05-24 19:30:00,1332,"Wow, that's another beauty Pump.  Good shootin'.  You barley get your hand around the tail.  Nice specimen."
972602,PUMP KNOWS,2016-06-06 19:37:00,937,Carp on the fly  
972661,AKRISONER,2016-06-07 15:52:00,5558,"hey pump, been watching you on instagram, loving the fly carp vids...and was that a bowfin you caught there on your last one?  what kinda flys are you tossin for them. I found a local carp pond out here in BC and am considering giving err a go."
972830,PUMP KNOWS,2016-06-08 16:04:00,937,"Yup, it was a bowfin.  Here's the fly I like using for carp and bowfin.  I don't know the name of the fly but he told me they were made for bonefish.  "
972837,AKRISONER,2016-06-08 17:28:00,5558,from the video it looks like you were nymphing for the bowfin as well?
972904,PUMP KNOWS,2016-06-09 01:23:00,937,I just sight fish for them.  I try to present the fly close to their faces and see how they react.  You can tell if they're interested when the fins are wiggling.
