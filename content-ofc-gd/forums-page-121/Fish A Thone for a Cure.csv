975742,The Urban Fisherman,2016-07-06 21:57:00,2050,"Hey boys,  My apologies for not being on the ball with regards to the Fish-a-Thon so far this season.  I've had some major changes going on in my life and it's been a grind to find time to get things going.  I'm hoping to start the big push really soon and I will absolutely keep my OFC family in the loop!  Thanks so much for checking in!  Talk soon!"
