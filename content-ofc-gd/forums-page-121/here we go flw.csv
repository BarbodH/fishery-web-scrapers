975869,Old Ironmaker,2016-07-08 12:59:00,8243,Tournaments have been getting some heavy criticism as of late. I hope all play by the rules and everything goes well. Tourneys like this bring some much needed revenues to areas like Rice. Good luck and first and foremost be safe and have fun and out there.

975878,AKRISONER,2016-07-08 13:50:00,5558,Tournaments have been getting some heavy criticism as of late. I hope all play by the rules and everything goes well. Tourneys like this bring some much needed revenues to areas like Rice. Good luck and first and foremost be safe and have fun and out there.  out of all of the tournaments I have seen the FLW does the most to ensure the livelihood of the fish population.  What gets me are the bushleague tournaments hosted by xyz resort or even trailer parks that hold fishing tournaments for residents where there is literally no proper fish weighing and holding apparatuses.  The FLW is the least of our worries.
