975462,misfish,2016-07-03 16:35:00,29133,"Day three of fishing and Im pretty much torched from the sun.LOL     One of my favorite ways to catch active buckets, is to boil a spinner bait. I was throwing top water at first and getting  fish, but I had to  grab the spinner bait and start boiling with fan casts. It,s a great way to fish over weeds and cover alot of water. Shallow or deep water, this method is very effective. I managed a few this morning this way.  I  was lucky enough to get a video of one hitting and landing it.      This one was over weeds in 12 fow.     Hope everyone had a great fishing long weekend like I did.      "
975463,Terry,2016-07-03 16:40:00,14456,"nice great to get on the water i haven't bothered taking many  pictures but got a double header and I was the only one on the toon, so I took a bit of a video  "
975464,misfish,2016-07-03 16:46:00,29133,That was way cool.
975468,Joeytier,2016-07-03 17:51:00,3990,I love burning spinnerbaits across the top.  More versatile than a buzz bait that's for sure.  Boil it across the weeds and slow it down when you come into a pocket...

975472,aplumma,2016-07-03 21:02:00,6896,I made it to pond X today and the pattern was topwater what a blast. We then switched to burning spinners but the final answer was sencos in the weed holes for big bass.   Art
975473,misfish,2016-07-03 21:22:00,29133,"Funny how you guys say BURNING. Im not burning these baits. I hold the rod high and just retrieve the bait under the surface. Im not burning it, just making a wake boiling effect ."
975495,aplumma,2016-07-04 13:32:00,6896,Ahh we call that bulging. A light spinnerbait subsurface with an occasional breaking of the surface. Burning is a heavier spinner subsurface retrieved very quickly back to the boat. Chopping is retrieving back and stop cranking to make the lure helicopter then resume retrieving. Flaring is retrieving with an irregular cadence such as 4 cranks slight pause repeat with different number of cranks. Lots of different ways to fish a spinnerbait for sure.  Art

975499,fish_fishburn,2016-07-04 14:48:00,1311,Spinnerbaits are awesome but my favourite search bait for buckets in the weeds is ripping a white mouse back to the boat
975501,Terry,2016-07-04 15:23:00,14456,Looks Like a 45'deg angle to me. So all is good. Lol
