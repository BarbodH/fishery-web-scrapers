975388,HTHM,2016-07-02 11:23:00,4082, You really shouldn't abuse you balls like that. We were all teenagers once....
975443,Dabluz,2016-07-03 04:01:00,701,The cheapest downrigger weights I can find in my region cost 50 bucks.  They are plain round lead balls.
973854,Salmon crazy,2016-06-16 00:10:00,4,I Thought I would share this new rigger weight that just got released from POW Casting. I was so impressed that I had to buy 2 of them. They are 10lbs weights. I really like the narrow profile and they are made in Canada. Cant wait to try them this weekend.   
973855,Fisherman,2016-06-16 00:14:00,7201,Post #1 and maybe just some advertising?
973857,Salmon crazy,2016-06-16 00:33:00,4,No Just a happy customer I'm more of a reader then a poster. I was reluctant to post this. For my first post  but I was to excited not to share my new rigger weights.
973859,Canuck,2016-06-16 00:42:00,491,Looks like it will be nose heavy and maybe run squirrelly.
973860,captpierre,2016-06-16 00:48:00,2521,Cost?
973865,Salmon crazy,2016-06-16 01:09:00,4,They are 75.00 till the end of the month from the shop I got them from
973868,Freshtrax,2016-06-16 01:19:00,2215,Nice looking weight . I've chatted with the owner on another forum seems like a good guy. Made in kitchener or Cambridge I belive . I just can't spend 75 on a weight    I buy used and on clearance .
973870,Terry,2016-06-16 01:24:00,14456,"too much for me and i dont think it will track well,"
973891,BillM,2016-06-16 11:54:00,17367,They're definitely cool looking.  Looking forward to your review.
973894,Sterling,2016-06-16 12:29:00,477,"They look good but do rigger weights actually attract fish? I think practicality is #1 when talking rigger weights. Terry makes a good point with tracking.  Side note, their website could use some TLC. The store (https://powcasting.ca/index.php?action=store) actually gives a red flag to which I had to manually add a security exception."

Weights absolutely attract fish, especially the sharks..  I've had lakers hit the canonballs, so they must be doing something"
973904,Gallie,2016-06-16 13:37:00,1215,"They look pretty cool but i have had issue with fish and pancake shaped weights in the past, on rough days or when fishing near other boats where tighter turns may be necessary they like to cross. When 2 rigger weights get tangled it is a nightmare to sort out, ill stick to my balls thanks?"

973911,Freshtrax,2016-06-16 14:29:00,2215,I have a pair of Ridgeback rattlers...some days there the ony thing in the boat that catches fish no intrest till they go down then the screen lights up.
973919,Gallie,2016-06-16 15:24:00,1215,"You could be right bill, the heaviest we have ever fished was 12 lbers but most were 10lb. We started with manuals and could have cranked in 20s if we needed but when we got an old set of electric big johns they struggled with the 12s so we just fished the 10s. We have never tangled once using balls."

974036,captpierre,2016-06-17 16:30:00,2521,Gravel road? Makes em even more itchy.
974587,Salmon crazy,2016-06-23 10:30:00,4,I got to try them out last weekend they track and are balanced better then I thought. I tried to take a video but it was to just to sunny.  
975263,Dabluz,2016-07-01 00:18:00,701,"I just bought a used boat and it has a manual downrigger on it.  I've never used a downrigger before.  From what I have read, a 10 lb ball is the one to buy first."
