975152,jedimaster,2016-06-29 14:25:00,3472,How big of water will you be on? Champions can handle some really rough water. I have riden a few older champs. The Princecraft will be more comfortable on smaller waters (like kawartha size) with 4 people. but fewer than 4 people and the champion will be a more solid ride and much better fishing platform.  As for fuel mileage. If you run both boat at 40mph (likely 3/4 throttle cruising rpms on the champ) and wot on the princecraft you will see rather similar fuel consumption. bass boats are fairly efficient cruising hulls of course if you cruise at WOT then yah you will burn as hole in your pocket. IF you run either WOT of course the smaller boat will get better fuel mileage.  IMO if this is a fishing boat I would go with the champ. If its a family boat I would go with princecraft.
975154,John Bacon,2016-06-29 14:49:00,3277,"The right boat would depend on the type of fishing and any other uses you intend.I do a lot of open water trolling with down riggers, etc., the Princecraft would better suit my needs.  If most of your fishing is casing the shallows for bass, then the Champion would be better suited to that type of fishing.  The Princecraft would also be better for cruising around the lake with your family too."
975161,Bass Tard,2016-06-29 17:52:00,128,"I don't like old fiberglass boats, my vote would be for the princecraft.  But what do I know, I own two ""cracker""s..."
975179,Old Ironmaker,2016-06-29 23:04:00,8243,"Those 2 boats are entirely different. For running and gunning the Bass boat, for a general ""Fish and Ski"" family run about the Princecraft. You may already know that for any given boat just a foot longer equates to a much roomier boat. For me my boat serves it's purpose. I can take 3 others out with me for a nice boat ride. I move the seats around and I can have one on the bow casting and one on the casting platform at the stern, if still fishing for perch I can have the 3 of us comfortably. Take 2 seats out and we run 4 rods longline trolling with myself and another maximum. If it's versatility you want a 17 to 20 foot aluminum is your boat. You need to decide what ""purpose"" you want before buying. Ask around here and get yourself invited for a day and see what you like best or go to every showroom you can and get in the boats with the number of folks you see yourself out with for a day. A pal bought a 20 foot Ranger Bass boat and was surprised how little space there is once 2 persons and he are aboard."

975186,JoePa,2016-06-29 23:54:00,179,I hear you guys but - I bought my 17 ft deep V Tracker new back in 1991 - I paid close to 10K for it - it has a 40 OMC on it - I had no problems with it at all - still have it and intend to keep it for a long time - on the motor I have never changed the impeller on the water pump - from what I read it is the newer welded hulls that are cracking and buyers are not getting satisfaction from the customer service - if I were to buy a new boat it would be a Lund - I've fished in a couple of these boats and really liked them - I actually priced one last year just for kicks - getting one with everything I wanted would set me back around 33K -

974856,porkpie,2016-06-26 13:36:00,2521,"If I where looking at boats, I'd look at starcraft, Lund, princecraft or Crestliner.  All have a good track record of building quality boats.  There are other brands but those 4 are a good starting point.  I have a preference for Lund.  I believe I have a pretty good all around boat, a 16 foot 50hp combo.  It does a lot of things well with 2 guys in the boat, sometimes 3 can be tough depending what your doing and it's sometimes limited by big water, but I've had it on the main basin of Simcoe and the Great Lakes in good conditions.  You could get something similar for under 10k.  If your plan is to fish big water or regularly put 3 in the boat then go bigger.  Other people have covered the flaws to look for."

974895,Old Ironmaker,2016-06-26 20:01:00,8243,"Tracker boats are an entry level boat and are sold under powered. Once upgraded to the power they should be the prices are in line with a better boat. As they say God is in the details. I have looked at Trackers sitting outside of Bass Pro in St. Kitts On. and the detail and quality of ""some"" of those boats are deplorable. On one every hold was full of water from rain, welds that looked like a poor apprentice made the passes, and this is a showroom boat. I don't want to offend a Tracker owner but they are the Lada's of pleasure crafts."

974975,jedimaster,2016-06-27 17:55:00,3472,"It really depends on the brand, aluminum versus tin. If a tin boat your best off to stick with Lund, Princecraft and Crestliner. If fiberglass (bass boats and fish n skiis) I would definitely kick all chopper boats off the list. So fiberglass its either hand laid with sheets of fiberglass or they have a form and spray in fiberglass and vacuum press it into the form(Chopper). These are boats like Nitro, Astro etc... Skeeter, Ranger etc..are hand laid fiberglass. They will last well into 40 and 50 years as long as they are kept care of. Chopper boats can start to run into issues very soon after new. Given your price range Your going to be into older boats. JMHO. As for age cutoff. With a tin boat I would try and be 30yrs or newer if its one of the above brands and really and age if its a hand laid fiberglass boat. Be weary of any welded aluminum hull. For motors, the older Yam motors are the most reliable.  Again this is just my opinion."

975048,slidehammer,2016-06-28 02:42:00,28,"check the condition of the carpet, try to get a feeing of the floorboards. Stand in the boat and if you feel any soft spots, if the floor needs changing. check the wiring, if it looks neat, thats good, if it looks all spliced, then be aware. check the bilge pump and listen weather it turns on smoothly and quietly and also the pump for live well. check the electronics if they operate and the holders are not cracked. check the lighting and the trolling motor if there is one. make sure the troller works. check the age of the batteries for starting and trolling check the trailer tires if they are worn and see if the trailer is equipped with bearing buddies. does it have a spare? check the prop look for bent and dents and unscrew the lower unit gear oil screw to check condition of the oil and for metal bits on the screw. most the top issues are bargaining items and not real deal breakers and can be fixed or replaced for reasonable amounts depending if yu can do it yourself. the one thing that is most important is to have the motor compression checked. if compression varies by more than 10%from one cylinder to another or there is no compression, the motor will need major expensive work."

975090,Korber,2016-06-28 20:01:00,79,"I will chime in but most people have covered what you should look for. Johnson/Evinrude motors are well built and have surplus parts available, sometime to consider as all things break. You can get into an older aluminum boat and be fine given a: the boat was a quality product to begin with; ie Princecraft, sea nymph, creastliner, Lund as more as mentioned above. b: is how it was taken care of, so look it over well check for welds and anyone re riveting the gussets. Check the transom as well its a big thing. If you're handy the condition of the seats and such are not a big deal as they are easily replaced. A friend of mine has a small boat dealership / small engine shop just outside of Bancroft I am sure he can put you together something older, but nice, for $2000-$3000 range. I know he currently has a nice Lund bowrider with trailer for $5000. PM me if you are interested.  Good luck with your search."
