There's a lot of noise made on a few political threads here (and I concede that I make a disproportionate amount of the noise!), but those are few and far between. What I mostly see here is a bunch of people united by our passion for fishing and our love for this land. I'm thankful to be a Canadian today. This is a special country.  Have a great day everyone.  Dutch"
