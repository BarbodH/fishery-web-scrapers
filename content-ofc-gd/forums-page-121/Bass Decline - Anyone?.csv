If you could only get a 3lb smallmouth out of that school look for schools of bigger fish. Being an LSC smallmouth fisherman you will find that certain times of year you will see schools of fish and catch 50 2lbers and they are all the same size and you begin to wonder where all the big ones are. The big ones are somewhere else and it's up to you to figure that out. I can't agree more with Mister G.

975723,dave524,2016-07-06 16:53:00,4508,"One thing I noticed over my years is that Largemouth started showing up in a lot of lakes, like oligotrophic lakes in Haliburton that were previously Smallmouth only,  in the late 70's and increased in numbers. This type of lake was not really largemouth habitat , I suspect well meaning cottagers were the source of the fish  but in spite of that they thrived for a while, perhaps the largies are naturally in decline in some areas that they really were not suited for."
975724,KraTToR,2016-07-06 17:03:00,506,"my thoughts are that the smallie population has benefited from the zebra mussel and goby situation.  They are visual feeders and the cleaner water in the great lakes and Simcoe benefit them. Plus add a (new) food-source that they love and there you have it.  Regarding largemouth, we are at their most northern range.  If you look at their habitat down south there really isn't that much of it here.   Add in the lower water temps and shorter season and you have a pretty good recipe for the OPs concerns.  For example, long point lake erie has substantial largemouth habitat but they are seldom targeted as they are more difficult to catch and there's no size bonus over the smallie.  The season opener derby this year showed that the winning largemouth was about the same size as the winning smallie."

The new generation of anglers do practice more catch and release but the they also keep bass unlike their fathers IMO.  Our cottage lake will be great for several years as the cottagers have agreed to release bass in our small lake.  Then a visitor to the lake discovers the resource and the lake gets hammered for a summer.  The large bass are hard to catch for a few summers but they do recover.  It's pretty cyclic actually.

I woud think that the 1.3% refers to that died in the tournament boat livewells or in the livewell of the release boat.  I don't think they would have any measurements for post release mortality.  I don't know the survival rate is for the bass that they release; but I am sure that some of the must die.  Some of the culled fish may die after release as well.  Or, some unethical participants may ""cull"" a dead fish.  So, I would agree that the real mortality rate is higher than the 1.3% claimed.  But, I am not sure how much higher it is."

975500,AKRISONER,2016-07-04 14:55:00,5558,"Ok, perhaps I am totally out to lunch here, but I have a serious question for all of the bass anglers out there. Is it just me and my friends, or has there been a massive sharp decline in large sized bass and even species over the past 2 years.  Here is my hypothesis and supporting piece of evidence.  Hypothesis: The record cold and winters that we had 2 years ago severly impacted the population of aging bass and in some northern locals nearly eliminated populations of largemouth bass. Or a natural culling cycle is occuring.  -In the years 2008-2013...it went without question that in the Pointe Au Baril area, i could consistently catch largemouth bass in certain honey holes that I could frequent. No harvesting of bass was ever done in these spots, nor did I ever witness other anglers specifically targeting these fish in these locations over a 6 year period of time. That was until last summer where I became totally perplexed by the decline in the largemouth population in the Pointe Au Baril area. Last year I caught a grand total of 2 largemouth bass in an entire year. -The MNR was conducting a study in the Pointe Au Baril area of fishing rates and catches for the entire year. I routinely ran into the MNR every weekend I angled for the entire year. The one student (I cant recall his name now) was in the boat every weekend and by the end of the summer his weekly visit to my boat always included some additional fishing talk. I sure enough inquired to him about bass catch rates and he indicated that out of the entire year, he had a grand total tally of 4 largemouths being caught in the entire PAB area by all anglers over the course of the entire year. (incredible)  -My main fishing homie has a spot on upper buckhorn. He consistently fishes every single weekend from bass opener until thanksgiving. Last year his largest fish was a 3.5 largemouth bass. The trailer record for the entire year was 4.5lbs and I would put their family catch numbers for the year well over 800. The pattern has held this year and he has yet to break the 4lb mark. In previous years it was without question that him along with with father and dads best friend would consistently boat 4lb bass with at least a few 5lbers all the way up to 7 lbers on an annual basis.  - I spent approximately 45 hours this past week targeting smallmouth bass. I would estimate that myself along with my fishing buddy boated over 60 fish over the course of the week. Out of these 60 fish, the largest was 3lbs 1oz  I was just reading a report and noticed that fisherpete said he fished rice this past weekend and caught 25 fish and the biggest largie he could muster was 3lbs...Ive also had some PM conversations with other members here that consistently boat big bass and they had indicated that the size of fish was way way down.  so I put this out to all you bass fishers out there...is something going on? Is this just a natural cycle? Did those 2 unusually cold winters do something or am i just cookoo?  Where the Nicklebass at Tho?! holla at me!"
975502,John Bacon,2016-07-04 16:24:00,3277,"I think the cold season would affect the bass population.  They grow slower in cold water.  A lot of the large bass from a few years ago are gone.  The medium sized bass from a few years ago may not have grown much (and thus, didn't become large bass) due to the cold weather.  Many lakes may have also lost a couple of year classes because the young of the year may not have made it through the winter."

975524,jedimaster,2016-07-04 19:35:00,3472,"I have been gone from Ontario for a few years and I have now been to a few lakes this season. The lakes I have been to are sitting up a lot differently than what I remember. Weed lines have changed, Water clarity is different, the bass have been spawning later as well. A late spawn gives that year class a shorter growing season. Different weed lines and boating pressure not just fishing pressure have an effect on fish populations. There are still big bass in the lakes but they can be tricky to find. Some weed patches are completely gone, some are much more dense.  Cooler summer temperatures,, shorter growing seasons, changes in lake structure and cover, increase in boating, increase in fishing. For example the tri lakes are housing so many tournaments its unreal. From the opener alone until now, there have been 5 tournaments that I know of. FLW, Might Mucks, an invitational, I think there was a Bass Federation as well and CSFL has two separate ones on the 9th and one on the 10th. When tournaments relocates hundreds of bass right after spawn on lakes it will have an effect on finding fish for certain."

Im not going to get in to the white bucket thing, but when you see so many filled with everything, it,s going to take it,s toll. They have every right to take thier limit. Not only them, but any one with a stringer full.  I havent seen the big hawg buckets in a while as well. Smallies on the other hand, well, my reports have shown they are out there.  I think the smallies are a heartier fish then the buckets. Less seems to bother them weather and temp wise. They will suspend in 100 fow and search for food. Buckets dont . Not that I have seen anyways.  I still think it comes down to pressure and keep and not release. Buckets are easy prey for shore anglers.  Again, this is JMO.  Edit to add,,,,  I was talking to a buddy at work. He and his family had a great weekend catching large mouth on thier small lake. Something like 20 were kept for a fish fry. 20 may not sound like a lot, but that 20 that wont be contributing to the future. Something to think about."

A lot of lakes that don't have pressure the fishing has been fantastic as expected.  Fishing the heavily pressured lakes like the kawarthas its the other way around.  The fish are healthy and big, but you really gotta work hard and fish hard to find them.  That's why you see big bags from tourney anglers, they are working their butts off  pre fishing and patterning which is different than only having a weekend to fish here and there. Way to many anglers harvesting bass, and I have no prob with people taking some for a meal.  But the limits need  to be dropped and a slot limit implemented.  Some of the lakes I fish recently had pike invade and that's hurt all species.  Lake Seymour being invaded by water soldier has changed that lake.  So there are lots of scenarios that affect certain waterbodys.  In my humble opinion."
