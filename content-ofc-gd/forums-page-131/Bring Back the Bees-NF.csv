965533,FloatnFly,2016-04-06 23:53:00,1640,"lets do this.  free wild flower seeds available.  also, do not spray your dandelions in the spring, its the first source of food for honey bees.  https://bringbackthebees.ca/  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fbMQUVYuRQ"
965537,Rod Caster,2016-04-07 00:26:00,5784,"My lawn is a dandelion haven in the early spring, I love seeing tons of yellow for a few weeks. I only cut when the dandelions have turned to seed.  I can't believe there are municipal laws against growth of 'weeds' like wildflowers. I just shake my head at the pointless vanity  Once my wife stops getting pregnant we'll raise our own bees too."
965539,manitoubass2,2016-04-07 00:42:00,11391,"Ah the horrible dandelion!  Smh  Leave em bee?and use em when ya can. Teas, wine and salads"
965590,Sinker,2016-04-07 13:03:00,8692,I'm considering getting a couple hives this year to see what its all about. Something to do at the very least.  S.
965593,Headhunter,2016-04-07 13:24:00,5703,My son's Bearded Dragon loves dandelion leaves! Can't wait to get out on the lawn and pick him his breakfast vs buying chopped Kale from the store! HH
965598,crappieperchhunter,2016-04-07 13:52:00,2582,The bees must love our cottage in Bobcaygeon. Almost more dandelions then grass in the spring.  One of these years I'm gonna try to make a batch of dandelion wine. I've already done some research on the internet....it actually looks pretty easy.
965602,SirCranksalot,2016-04-07 14:18:00,3291,Years ago I read an article about farmers growing dandelion commercially in the South. The biggest problem they were having was the intrusion of grass!  I loved that irony. The definition of 'weed' is purely subjective.  Give it a few years and it will be the trendy thing on salads and sandwiches in yuppified neighborhoods in the GTA.    Once my wife stops getting pregnant we'll raise our own bees too.   Maybe if someone had 'splained the birds and the bees to you that wouldn't have happened quite so much!
965619,Rod Caster,2016-04-07 15:54:00,5784,I just googled birds and bees. Graphic

965693,Fisherman,2016-04-07 23:30:00,7201,I get mine from Maguires in Minesing.  Tastes a 100 times better than that liquid sugar with food colouring.
965699,Sinker,2016-04-07 23:45:00,8692,Sounds like a great spot for some hives. I have a few buckwheat fields close to my place. Makes the best honey apparently.

Makes the best honey apparently.  tempting, but with a young daughter around, i don't her bugging the hives.  theres a couple pear trees, an apple tree, i think apricot or some other weird fruit, some grape vines.  downside is it brings the wasps around"
965703,manitoubass2,2016-04-07 23:54:00,11391,Oh man our last house had a few plum trees and it sure atracts hornets/wasps
965744,MistyHollow,2016-04-08 11:13:00,21,"As a youngster.....yes a very long time ago........ I kept bees with the old neighbour across the road. 12 hives that we gathered from  producing jars of all natural honey. I became allergic to stings, he past on and I still play with bees.  I have had a wild hive in a red oak trunk for the past 8 years on the farm. The hive has split twice, and getting ready to do so again, so this year I am putting two top bar hives up in the hedge for them. I might add that unlike commercial hives I have yet to have a hive die off over winter in this tree.  Dan"

965799,aplumma,2016-04-08 18:38:00,6896,A hive will range for 3-5 miles to gather nectar.   Art
