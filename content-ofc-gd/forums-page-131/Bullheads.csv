Worms out for picking is unreliable..no offence intended...seeing as that was possible 3 weeks ago here in Oshawa. Plants seem to be a better barometer. I go by my tarragon plants in my herb garden. when they are about a foot high I head out bullhead fishing, in this area. With this cold weather they have not even poked out of the ground yet  Edit to add and perhaps help answer azens question better.... like mentioned  by fishwilly ...keep an eye on the dandelions in your area. I'm guessing a minimum of 2 weeks away."
