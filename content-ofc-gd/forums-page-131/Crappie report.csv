965124,bigugli,2016-04-04 01:23:00,6138,"Despite all the up and down temperatures, I have been getting out int the Niagara area for some slabs. Not a typical spring by any measure. Have not had any on fire days. Mornings being too cold, the crappie don't turn on until the last 2-3 hours of the day. When they do turn on they are plain crazy, smacking anything that moves. Bucktails have been working great. Caught one that swallowed my float."
965128,kickingfrog,2016-04-04 02:23:00,8333,"Swallowed your float? You might want to set the hook sooner.  It's fun when they're hot eh. It will be soon here, I hope, soon."
965140,Old Ironmaker,2016-04-04 03:50:00,8243,"I would have to shovel the snow to get the boat out. We have about 4"" and counting up to now. This weather is just ridiculous. 2 weeks ago at Cayuga Golf Course the parking lot was nearly full and folks out with shorts."
965176,crappieperchhunter,2016-04-04 14:38:00,2582,Nothing doing at any of my spring shore fishing crappie or perch spots yet Bruce. Glad to hear someone is getting out and getting bit.
965179,netminder,2016-04-04 14:46:00,514,Nothing doing at any of my spring shore fishing crappie or perch spots yet Bruce. Glad to hear someone is getting out and getting bit. Same here. Ice and snow have meant I might be chasing trout before I find time to go for crappie.
965222,aplumma,2016-04-04 20:05:00,6896,here are a few crappie from down South in  Lousiania I really miss being down there because the crappie are huge.     Art
965230,misfish,2016-04-04 20:51:00,29133,"Those are crapzillas.  I waiting for this winter to end to try a small lake. Between the rivers being blown and cold/windy days, it,s hard to get out any where up here."
965882,bigugli,2016-04-09 16:41:00,6138,"Got out for the evening bite, yesterday, ahead of this latest cold front. Got a few blacks and whites in the 10'' range. I'm sure this latest front will have things screwed up for another 4-5 days."
965888,Acountdeleted,2016-04-09 18:06:00,2562,Wow! What monster crappies. Great haul.
965931,manitoubass2,2016-04-10 13:35:00,11391,Wow!!!
965982,mike rousseau,2016-04-10 20:52:00,4661,Just got my crappie gear organized... I've got 22 creeks and canals in an 8.5 mile stretch of shoreline marked out on my navionics to explore...  I really wanna find a spot of my own by boat so I can go and relax and enjoy myself... Take the kids without worrying about guys cursing and littering in front if them...  I've got a buddy that wants to explore with me next weekend...
966001,misfish,2016-04-10 22:35:00,29133,Looks like there will be some great weather coming for next weekend. Hope to finaly get out for some slabs. I dont like fishing around that stuff either Mike. Theres no need for it. Hope you get the kids out to a good spot.
