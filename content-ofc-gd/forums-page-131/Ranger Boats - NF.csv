965796,hirk,2016-04-08 18:28:00,571,"I'm looking for a big water boat for Erie.  I love the StarCraft.  I viewed 1 in Chatham, a 1989 offshore 22' for $10,000., I should have jumped on it, but didn't.  If you know of one for sale in very good condition, please PM me.  Thanx I know of an Islander for sale, or did you want an open boat?"
965797,aplumma,2016-04-08 18:34:00,6896, What seats did you put in it Art?    The seats are made by tempest  they have held up very well and the cushions have remained firm. I mounted them to the box lids to keep the storage area water tight. They have hinges to flip the two full seats and the center seat flips up and down to access the back of the boat easily without stepping on the cushions.  The pole seats are the same manufacture and I think the butt seat is from bass pro but I am not sure it also might be a tempest.   Art      
965801,grimsbylander,2016-04-08 19:09:00,3016,^^^ Those seats look great Art. I like the bit of storage underneath as well.
965819,aplumma,2016-04-08 20:59:00,6896,Sorry the 3 seat set for the driver passenger and jump seat are from Wise http://www.wiseseats.com/#!blast-off/cui8.The post seats are from Tempress.    Art
965853,Freshtrax,2016-04-09 02:19:00,2215,I have a 22 ft but would like a big aluminum for traveling .  Not in the market this year.
965858,wormdunker,2016-04-09 09:55:00,1711,"Thanx hirk.  I'm leaning towards a closed deck with a small cuddy just to have extra storage space for jackets, rain suits, even a porta potti .  PM me the info on the Islander please.  There's a 22' Offshore for sale but up in Earlton which is an 8 hour drive for me."
966116,craigdritchie,2016-04-11 22:05:00,1586,"I perceive Starcraft to be below Lund, Princecraft, alumacraft and Crestliner. That's my perception not fact - am I wrong? Enlighten me.   Starcraft makes a great boat, which is why you see so many older ones still on the water.  All but the smallest Starcraft fishing boats have the aluminum I-beam type of internal frame that give the hull strength. When the economy took a dump some of the other other brands stopped doing this in order to cut costs, while others now only have the I-beams in their top-end boats, not all of them. No wonder you don't see it mentioned in their ads any more.  I like how the wood transom on Starcrafts goes all the way to the floor, and not just across the top where the motor bolts on. On some boats, it's just sheet metal below the engine mount. Cheaper, for sure, but not very strong.  I like that even small things like cleats are through-bolted on Starcrafts, and not just screwed on as is the case for many (if not most) other brands. Through-bolting is much stronger, and won't pull out when stressed.  I like the way Starcraft sprays the foam flotation in between the hull and the deck, so it expands as it cures and completely fills all the cavities. It gives the boat a quieter ride, and it prevents rain water from pooling in there and forming mold. Some other brands just pour the foam in, then screw the deck on top, leaving gaps underneath. That's where deck rot begins.  I also like that Starcraft is still a family-run business, still owned by the same family that started it in 1903. The people that run the company are boaters and fishermen, not accountants and lawyers looking for ways to cut costs.  How's that for a start?  And no, I'm not on the company payroll. But I do like the product. If the right six numbers ever show up on my lottery ticket, that 2050 STX will be in my driveway the same day."
966124,landry,2016-04-11 22:38:00,1005,Thanks Craig. I have a nice ride now but will be buying again when I retire. Btw - I was not criticizing the brand in any way. Good info that I will one day use when making my next purchase. Landry
966170,wormdunker,2016-04-12 12:40:00,1711,"Thanx for the info Craig.  All good points to look at in my search.  Bolt through cleats simple, but a very important feature.  Nice also to know it's a family run business."

966190,fisher,2016-04-12 17:03:00,451,"I owned a 1992 StarCraft up until 2 years ago and it didn't leak one bit up to the day I sold it.  Those rivets held tight, even after banging into docks and the like over the years - especially the latter years when I was teaching my son to boat.  That was one of the reasons I replaced it with a new Smokercraft (same family as Starcraft)."

On some boats, it's just sheet metal below the engine mount. Cheaper, for sure, but not very strong.   my 1997 Lund pro fisherman is like that...I've contemplated that concept before, would I really notice a difference in how the boat handles on the water? only a 90hp on there"
965523,grimsbylander,2016-04-06 23:34:00,3016,"There's always a lot of conversation about boats, the costs, warranties, etc. and thought I'd share this because as a Ranger customer and fan of their products, I thought fellow boat owners would find it interesting. On another site I frequent, there is a post from a guy that owns a 1998 Ranger with a 225hp on it. Not sure if he bought it new but 18 years later, he is having a transom issue. When he stands on the outboards lower end, the transom flexes 1/4"". Not good, serious repair money. He contacted Ranger and they said, drop it off next week and we'll fix it, no charge. Failures like this don't happen very often and is likely due to the way the boat got treated but it amazes me that they'll do that for a customer."
965531,buick14,2016-04-06 23:49:00,741,"I think they might have that pultruded transom which was supposed to be bulletproof. Good on them for following through regardless ...that's what u want when u pay a premium for a boat even buying used. ""Oh u didn't buy it directly new from us? Can't help you"" only hurts them in the long run."
965559,wormdunker,2016-04-07 02:16:00,1711,Wow!  That's awesome!
965567,irishfield,2016-04-07 03:29:00,26272,Tracker and Legend could learn something from that...

965610,craigdritchie,2016-04-07 15:18:00,1586,"That's why I like Starcrafts. When they say lifetime warranty, they really mean it."
965650,Old Ironmaker,2016-04-07 19:38:00,8243,"It's a ""limited"" lifetime warranty from StarCraft on the hull and structure. Just as is for Lund. Like house shingles the depreciation is huge."
965652,Sinker,2016-04-07 19:50:00,8692,"The trick is they build them right, from the start, and have very few warrantee issues.  Mine is bullet proof.  S."

965686,aplumma,2016-04-07 22:42:00,6896,"I run a 1989 Ranger and it has been flawless in the build department. I chose that year because they changed the pad in 1990 for a smaller wet surface. I have been out in some nasty weather and have not felt scared and with upgraded seats my back has not been jammed even riding the caps of the waves. ( the factory seats back then where 2"" foam on plywood). The only thing I dislike is gas was cheap back then and the original motor is a 6 carb 150 2 stroke that burns 4/5th of a gallon a minute at full throttle. I looked into changing it out but at $11000.00 plus for a new motor I think I will wait till it blows up some year in the future. lol   Art"

I love it. But I wouldn't hesitate to trade it for an equal value Starcraft.  And if it wasn't for my love for large mouth bass slop fishing, I would have likely went with a Starcraft off the top. It is a superior open water / big water boat.  Starcraft makes a very quality boat. (and much better than Alumacraft!!)"
