Every year this group of men and woman volunteer their time to help tow countless broken down boats back to the saftey of the harbour, and assist in rescue operations . I've got an brutally old unit I was going to donate but figured I'd put the feelers out for something better.  Of course with the donation you'll recieve a full tax receipt. Feel free to PM me for their info, or possible leads on a unit to help these guys out. Thanks Ryan"
