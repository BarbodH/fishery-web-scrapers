The other (Merle Haggard), unfortunately past away on his birthday.  It was band practice (I use that term loosely?) so we (The FishGuts) honored Bud with a cake and honoured the Great Mr. Haggard by trying a few of his great songs (Okie from Muskogee, Branded and Sing Me Back Home). Thanks for the music Hag, and thanks for continuing to be an inspiration to me big brother."
