966463,John Bacon,2016-04-14 21:48:00,3277,I hope some IT people can help me with an issue.I am trying to use an Amazon server for a software development environment.  The Server is running Windows Server 2012 R2.  The server came with SQL 2014 preinstalled.Windows authentication is not working when I try to sign into SQL.  Is there a defaul user ID / Password for opening SQL on an Amazon server?
