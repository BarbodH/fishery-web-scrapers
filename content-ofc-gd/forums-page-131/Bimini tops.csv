965978,boombap,2016-04-10 20:42:00,310,Pick up my boat in a few weeks and I'm looking to get a bimini top.  What should I expect to pay for a custom made one? 16ft boat w/ windshield and 80in beam.  Can anyone recommend some places.. preferably in the GTA?
965980,mike rousseau,2016-04-10 20:45:00,4661,"They're expensive  Buddy paid around $2,500 for one for his 20' Pro V"
965985,2 tone z71,2016-04-10 21:10:00,1311,800.00 for my 17 ft lund same as he charged me last yr for my cover
965987,mike rousseau,2016-04-10 21:27:00,4661,You talking full enclosure or just a roof?
965990,2 tone z71,2016-04-10 21:47:00,1311,Just a roof Mike
965991,mike rousseau,2016-04-10 21:49:00,4661,Hsousa  Are you looking for a full enclosure or just a roof top?
966000,boombap,2016-04-10 22:32:00,310,Do you have something for sale?  I'm looking for just the roof but if something comes up who knows.
966005,mike rousseau,2016-04-10 23:08:00,4661,No just wondering why you said custom... That's why I was thinking you wanted full enclosure...  There's plenty of Bimini tops out there that you just buy the right width and hook it up...
966008,DRIFTER_016,2016-04-10 23:27:00,10439,You can save a ton by buying one through Basspro or Cabelas and installing it yourself. I got mine from Cabelas on sale for about $300 with a set of rails so I can slide it forward when in use and back when not in use. That way it lays just in front of the motor instad of in the middles of my rear casting deck.
966010,CBB,2016-04-10 23:42:00,10,Wished you were closer to me as I have one that came on my Lund Alaskan and has never been used. I find they are a pain if fishing as they obstruct both your sides and overhead. It is basically a Sun Shade that catches the wind

It is basically a Sun Shade that catches the wind  Ditto, I had a Bimini for my old center console, hated it, only used it in extreme conditions. It negated all the advantages of the center console with all the attachments to the gunnels. If I had it to do over I'd go with a T - top."
966067,glen,2016-04-11 17:03:00,2641,Yep I thought about it. Then bought a hat.
966071,fish_fishburn,2016-04-11 17:11:00,1311,Give these guys a look. www.anp.ca I used them last summer and am happy with the product I got from them.

On my buddies (RIP) 22 foot starcraft tin boat; I wired in a couple of removable fans. Fans like you'd see on the school buses. The combination of the bimini and the fans; we were good, not matter how hot it got out on Long Point Bay.  Dan."

Not to mention when it decides to rain cats & dogs."

966249,shimano19,2016-04-13 10:36:00,196,I have one that's practically brand new that I'm looking to sell. How do the measurements work. Not really sure how to advertise the specs
966279,Freshtrax,2016-04-13 13:36:00,2215,I know I couldn't survive many days on Lake Ontario without my hardtop.   You will find the shade priceless at least a few days a year.
966287,BillM,2016-04-13 14:34:00,17367,"I don't think you want a bimini, you want a full standup top.   Had one made for our Lund (1700 Pro Sport) it was $1600 or so.  This included a cover for the bow area, both sides with windows and a full rear cover as well (It basically covers the entire boat, lol.  Here's ours with just the top section on, really nice to get out of the sun and still easy enough to set riggers/dipsys, etc.  "

Not really sure how to advertise the specs  Width is usually adjustable ie 74""-82"" (gunnel to gunnel) Height is from the mounts to the top when up ie 54"" There are 3 bow and 4 bow tops (3 or 4 cross braces) 3 bow are shorter in length than 4 bow units (6' as opposed to 8')"
