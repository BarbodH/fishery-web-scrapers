I typically fish around the Timiskaming dam, however i know it is a fish sanctuary for pickerel so the Opening date is June 15th instead of the 3rd sat in May.My question is, where is the border of the fish Sanctuary? If i launch from the Dam, how far up the river do i have to travel to be able to fish? ..... Not sure if i can wait until the 15th to head out hahah"

Also, June SIXTEENTH is the opening day.  Also, the Temiscaming dam is currently being rebuilt, so a new ramp was built directly across from Thorne (just before you get to the bridge).  I live just down the road so msg me if you have any other questions."
