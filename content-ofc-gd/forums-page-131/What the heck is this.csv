966477,kickingfrog,2016-04-14 23:40:00,8333,Tidying the garage a bit today and I found this on the floor behind the boat. It looks so familiar and yet I don't know what it is or where it came from/how it got there.    
966481,cheaptackle,2016-04-15 00:05:00,849,Looks like parts of a receiver for a scotty type rod holder to me.  Michael
966490,GBW,2016-04-15 00:31:00,8460,I was going to guess an adjustable rod holder part too.  the kind that you lift and turn and push down to lock the angle in.
966496,kickingfrog,2016-04-15 01:03:00,8333,That makes sense. The boat came with one but I swapped it out for my salty. I put it on the back shelf.

Too worn and looks like too soft of a plastic for that from the pic"

966531,Old Ironmaker,2016-04-15 05:59:00,8243,"Yep, he's not just an idiot he's the Village Idiot. It a DNA thing as it was passed down the gene pool from his father who retired as the previous Village Idiot. We aren't talking about guys with both oars in the aqua. The real funny thing is that boat has been parked for 3 years now doing a full resto on it. He wants to pull the 70's wood panelling off the recroom walls and glue them together to put in the floor it might just work however I had to remind him he RENTS the place. We know it doesn't leak because it has 3 feet of pond water in it. That's amazing actually that is hasn't split wide open with the ice. I have some stories about these 2. I should call them acquaintances. Ooops hi jack alert level 3."
