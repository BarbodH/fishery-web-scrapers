I've played around with them last year with some success. I dab a little salmon oil on the egg when I start. Other than that I just dead drift them on a 6lb florocarbon leader and a #6 short hank hook about 2-3"" below the bead.  Any suggestions (secrets), do's and don'ts for using these would be appreciated as I'm new at using these baits.  Thanks, muddler"
966315,BillM,2016-04-13 18:27:00,17367,"Don't go crazy with the hook set on them, I usually do a slow lift when fishing beads and my hookup ratio went way up.   Also, this time of year I always carry a few red worms as well.   Even minnow imitations..  Spring is the best time of year to switch up your bait selection for steelies."
966321,muddler,2016-04-13 20:38:00,623,Thanks. I'll try that slower hook set.  muddler
966322,MJL,2016-04-13 20:49:00,2427,"I fish beads just like any other bait, fly/jig or lure below the float. I would tone down the hook sets though. Beads are far less water resistant than roe bags and if you miss on the hook set, be prepared for a bead/hook combo flying back at you at warp speed.LOL"
966323,misfish,2016-04-13 20:51:00,29133,"Im hooked on the bead now. Never not have one on my line now. I will move it up 12"" from the hook when I want to just drift a bag or worm. I have had them hit the bead even up that high and drag it down.  Im pretty stoked about my 3 new glass bead lots.  Cant wait to give them a try these next few days.  Natural    Boiled single    And frosted white    "
966325,Garnet,2016-04-13 21:11:00,2056,I go to the bead when it's gin clear and bright sun. There hook up % is awful but a bite is better than no bite.
966326,DRIFTER_016,2016-04-13 21:15:00,10439,Beads? . . . . . Beads don't work!!!    What size beads and hooks are you guys using that your hooking % sucks? My bead hookup rate is North of 90% and maybe even 95%. I run larger hooks with beads and I run beads from 6mm to 16mm depending on conditions and what fish I'm after.
