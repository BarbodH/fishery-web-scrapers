Every year I look forward to go fish this area with about 10 buddies who have all spent most of their lives guiding across Canada and some who still are. As a person who loves to fish but was never able to make a career out of it it's pretty amazing to get up there with these guys watching old videos and hearing stories of their adventures across Canada catching massive fish.We made the ten hour drive from Sault ste Marie up to Oba ontario where we still had 3 to 3 and half feet of ice just about anywhere we looked ....far cry from what we had down here this year. First day out a smaller group of us who went up early got into about 300 small pike who for some reason were all over the pickerel grounds. The weather has been all over the map just before we went up making the fishing ""slow"" for up there and the fish were not where we expected.The next day we went up river into kaby lake ....the largest lake in algoma. Again we had beautiful weather but everyone had to actually work a bit to get their limit of pickerel which is a bit of a suprise up there. I managed a nice 22 inch pickerel with a few large pike caught and a ton of perfect eaters. One of the highlights was when a pike spit up a large burbot and a huge bald eagle came within ten feet of our group to swoop down and eat it ...of course the massive fish fry we had that night was pretty good too. Trip of a life time for sure and luckily I get to go every year with an awesome group of guys.If anyone here is ever looking for a destination with amazing walleye fishing ...amazing guides and a great camp I can't recommend these guys enough.

965321,Browns,2016-04-05 14:22:00,7,Pike fishing that felt like perching wasn't our dream haha a lot of hammer handles that day ...but can't ever complain about catching fish.  Once we were able to take the river up into kaby we found most of the pike hand been filling up on burbot. Most of the pike that day had at least one in them and a few spit them up after being caught.

Based on the stories, if it wasn't so far to go for our annual fishing trip we'd probably go there instead!  Looks like a nice haul and a good time on the ice."
