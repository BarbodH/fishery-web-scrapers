965413,Can_38,2016-04-06 14:10:00,152,I narrowed my search down to the Humminbird Helix 5 DI/GPS until I noticed sail has a Garmin unit (Echomap 55DV) on for the same price.  I have made the decision that side imaging is not for me so lets leave that out  Anyone running a Garmin unit or could provide any feedback on this decision?

The Helix i believe is not compatible with Universal Sonar on Min Kota's where as the Garmins are, but with Down Imagining you will have to use the sonar that comes with the package to get the benefits of DI, also it will be more beneficial off the transom then off the bow mount, where you can scan structure and mark waypoints, as the transducer is always in the water, instead of the bow mount where its in and out of the water, in when fishing out when moving from spot to spot"
