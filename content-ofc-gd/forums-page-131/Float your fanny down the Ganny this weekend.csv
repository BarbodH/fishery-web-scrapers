966101,esoxansteel,2016-04-11 21:01:00,1307,"35 years of altering, impeding and molesting the annual spring spawning run of Ganaraska River Steelhead, and 35 years of the MNRF for allowing it to happen, and doing nothing about it, while hundreds of man made water craft, tear up gravel beds, and push spawning Steelhead off their beds, and people tramping through the spawning beds as their crafts become stuck on the gravel and shale. Again this assault on the river by hundreds of people who dont give a rats ass about the river or its fish, and will leave their garbage and broken water craft scattered all over the riverbanks, and also the people who come to watch will do the same, and with the warmer temps predicted, fish will be up on spawning beds in large numbers."
966105,FloatnFly,2016-04-11 21:19:00,1640,"it used to be earlier, but it changed a couple years ago due to the river being frozen over.  no reason they couldn't do it earlier this year.  good news i guess is that the fish really aren't moving due to the water being too cold"
966125,mike rousseau,2016-04-11 22:49:00,4661,We have a canoe race here annually on a trib during the walleye spawn... And the heaviest spawning area is at a small dam where a lot of canoes flip over and the participant have to walk around on the spawning grounds...  Been going on a long time

I'm not saying the race is a good idea but here was our experience:  We scraped the bottom a few times with the hull and dinged it a few times with our paddles but, like most canoeists, we try to avoid doing either as it (a) damages our eqpt and ( slows us down. We didn't see any canoes or kayaks overturned except below the dam. We portaged around the dam as did everyone else that we saw.  The was the expected mayhem with the 'crazy craft' below the dam, but on the upstream section it seemed like quite an orderly canoe and kayak race.  Maybe the water was particularly high that year. I simply don't know."

I simply don't know.  Last year. one of the Crazy crafts had to redo the bottom of there craft with more orange plastic fence as it was completely gone from rubbing the bottom .. i have no issues with canoes or kayaks .. it when you get 10 to 20 people on a craft and they drag the crap out of the bottom"
966256,Garnet,2016-04-13 11:36:00,2056,If we get the air temps Thurs and Fri most of the fish will go thru. Doesn't help the reds below.
966296,Richard S.,2016-04-13 15:27:00,75,"Guys, there are still a ton of fish that spawn from Canton south through Sylvan Glen and even below that, now because the temps below the dam in town get too hot throughout the summer most if not all those fry will parish, so that is a mute point. I do however hope the Liberals are able to change fisheries act because i will be making some inquiries with the DFO and MNR, because if you read the act, it states that it ""prohibits the harmful alteration, disruption, and destruction of habitat"". Now, i'm no genus but all that happens when all those rafts blow through the shallows dredging up the bottom, especially on low water years.  Rich."
966328,esoxansteel,2016-04-13 21:38:00,1307,"All good points yes, and while crazy craft scraping the bottom of finished redds is likely the biggest impact, also the canoes and yaks that dont scrape bottom, but still push fish off redds by spooking them, and we like to think they would return.  If it cant be stopped, it should be moved as Chessy said to a time thats not disruptive to the spawning steelhead run, moved it to September, and let them muck with the Chinook run instead"
966336,Freshtrax,2016-04-13 23:25:00,2215,Or July and mess with none of them
966339,Salmonidstalker,2016-04-13 23:42:00,265,I imagine they do this in the spring because of the volume of water. So changing it to summer or fall wouldn't get them down the river. I think this event should be cancelled all together. Between this event and the gong show in the fall below the dam the river looks and is treated like an amusement park. Not a natural resource.
966353,Sinker,2016-04-14 02:14:00,8692,They do it now to celebrate the flood in 1980 when the dam blew out.  All it is is a money grab for the town.  S.
