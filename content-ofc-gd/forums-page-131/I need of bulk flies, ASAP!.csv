966406,GBW,2016-04-14 16:21:00,8460,Anyone know where I can get 50 to 60 fly fishing lures (like a wollybugger) ASAP near Lindsay? Need that many of the same as they are going to be attached to a memorial card. My bestfriend whom I call my sister lost a loved one on Tuesday morning to cancer and fishing is something he loved.  So they want to attach a lure to each guests card for the memorial.  Any help would be great.  I'm in Lindsay and right now she's in Orillia

966410,FloatnFly,2016-04-14 16:34:00,1640,Ummm try either east Hill outdoors or sail in oshawa.   Only 2 places I can think of immediately.   Outside of ordering them off a website. Or try getting a hold of kypefish quality flies.  Hes local.  May be able to meet up with something quick
966416,GBW,2016-04-14 17:05:00,8460,thanks!  I already PM Matthew from Kypefish and all the TO wholesales are out of stock for that many of the same type and size...  This is going to be harder than I thought...
966420,BillM,2016-04-14 17:36:00,17367,Try reelflies.ca
966426,adempsey,2016-04-14 18:11:00,1498,"What about BPS?  It's not that far from Orillia.   They have a bunch of pre-tied flies in the fly shop.  Although, I haven't been there in a couple of years.  There also a lot of tackle shops near Orillia, like Epps and Trombly's, but I don't know if they sell flies.  Even Canadian Tire sells flies.  You can get a package of six for $7."
966430,GBW,2016-04-14 18:35:00,8460,"Thanks again all and I got hooked up with a person who is placing a rush order in for me with his custom flies!!
