965941,leaf4,2016-04-10 16:17:00,2466,That is actually very cool
965943,Gerritt,2016-04-10 16:25:00,6129,I have a buddy that builds them as well..... Wicked little stoves
965951,Fisherman,2016-04-10 18:19:00,7201,That's quite the stove.
965976,chris.brock,2016-04-10 20:40:00,4053,My craftsmanship is much better.  
965979,cheaptackle,2016-04-10 20:44:00,849,Ya know if we all chip in a dime or two we could get Chris another length of chimney pipe so his feet could be warm too...  Just Kidding!  Michael
965988,farsider,2016-04-10 21:38:00,456,"Lots of examples on Youtube.  Go as elaborate or Brockian as you want!  Cheers, Mark"
965993,SirCranksalot,2016-04-10 21:55:00,3291,My craftsmanship is much better.    So does that meet the local fire code???
965996,G.mech,2016-04-10 22:08:00,830, So does that meet the local fire code???  once you cut the side out of tank to let the propane out it's perfectly safe & legal!

966025,Shloim,2016-04-11 02:08:00,515,Personally i like the way you situated the cardboard box with the dry kindling nice and close to the opening of the stove...
966026,SirCranksalot,2016-04-11 02:16:00,3291,"I bet he could roast his nuts in that hut (Chestnuts, y'know, like roasting on an open fire)"
966027,chris.brock,2016-04-11 02:41:00,4053,You guys go ahead and have your laughs while I'll be fishing with the ambience of a crackling fire warming my balls.
966037,Fisherman,2016-04-11 11:29:00,7201,We're all just jealous of your comfy hut.
966050,SirCranksalot,2016-04-11 14:57:00,3291,"When I see the inside of that hut ""ambience"" is not the first word that  springs to mind, somehow!!"
966051,Crackerjack,2016-04-11 15:02:00,34,cool idea!
966096,esoxansteel,2016-04-11 20:40:00,1307," So does that meet the local fire code???   Up in the boonies Chris makes the firecode, the laws and homeland security"
966097,manitoubass2,2016-04-11 20:42:00,11391,Looks like a good hut to me Chris???
