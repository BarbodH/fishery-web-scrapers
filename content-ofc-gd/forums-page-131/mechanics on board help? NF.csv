I understand that you wont have the equipment to do this; I just want you to know that there's an easy way for a shop to tell you whether it is or is not contaminated fuel. Here's what the fuel system cleaner tool looks like.   Just a few simple steps for them and the fact that your vehicles (with help) still run, will make this test even easier. Disable the fuel pump, connect the hose from the injector cleaning tool to the fuel rails schrader test port Attach the arousal can of cleaner to the tool, Adjust the pressure reg to the required pressure for your fuel system and start the engine. Once the suspected bad fuel has been used up and the cleaner gets in there, the engine should begin to run normally; if it was contaminated fuel.  Dan."

The ones that look like a scuba diver's tank. Like I said redneck and you'd need to make sure the hose from the sprayer to the fuel rail can handle the 45-60 psi needed. But here's how. Pull the fuel pump relay (In the under hood fuse/relay box) and make sure the pump does not run (listen at the tank) while trying to start the engine. Disconnect the in-coming fuel line at the fuel rail. Connect sprayer hose to fuel rail; securing with clamps Add a couple of liters of gas to the sprayer. Pump up the sprayer until it becomes quite hard to pump. Attempt starting. If it starts, allow the suspect fuel in the rail to be used up and fresh fuel from the sprayer is being fed to the injectors. If it begins to run ""normally"" you found the problem and you're now draining the fuel tank and lines. My first fuel system cleaning kit was just a glorified weed sprayer; but made from material that was not affected by gasoline. For a one time use, any sprayer would likely do?  Dan.     "

I have had a couple customer's cars over the years; that were directly & indirectly hit. One was written off by the insurance and the other, we were allowed to repair. Didn't know what was going on with the one we repaired; it came in as a no crank & battery dead. After finding that the battery wouldn't take a charge and replaced; there were still no communications with any of the modules (computers). Then I noticed that the radio antenna was chard and twisted up like a pig's tail. Called the customer and asked if there was a storm in her area. She said yes, the pole light in front of her house was hit; which took out most of the electronics in her house. Ended up replacing 90% of the modules in the car, along with the starter and alternator. The funny thing was, the radio survived and that's where the lightening Via the antenna came in?  Dan."

Did someone sugar or water my tanks?  When you start them the vehicle just shakes and sound like its starving for gas. Rpms go up past 3000 just touching the peddle.

Cheapest also...."
964147,manitoubass2,2016-03-27 23:00:00,11391,???  Thanks for any/all advice.  If it was just straight up bad gas Id tend to think id hear about it as I know probably 50 people that fill up at the same place everyday(but it is possible)  Guess im SOL till tuesday
964149,ecmilley,2016-03-27 23:07:00,2163,"g   Sorry, but the first and easiest thing to do is hook up, it's a no brainier especially when his vehicles are telling him their sick..... Cheapest also....  guess everyone must have a scan tool code reader these days and still don't mean squat if you cant understand how diagnosis the code, no I can open a fuel line pretty quick and cycle key in my driveway, code reader don't tell u its bad fuel best you get is p0300 multible misfire which is wide open to causes but thought he wanted a professional opinion oh well"
964152,manitoubass2,2016-03-27 23:41:00,11391,"All good bud, that helps. I suppose I should call insurance before syphoning???  Just in case? What the heck does a guy do in this situation?  Since both vehicles did run for abit before crapping out the next day Im assuming some damage is done?"
964153,manitoubass2,2016-03-27 23:55:00,11391,"I am going to get a reader too. Dads bringing it out tomorrow.  Be a good thing to have regardless.  Ec, what happens if I find water in the fuel? If that indeed is the issue.  Or am I just screwed?  Legally and for my vehicles..."
964155,Terry,2016-03-28 00:07:00,14456,"most times drain gas,  put in new gas run seafoam   reset codes buy gas else where in the future"
964158,Pigeontroller,2016-03-28 00:23:00,2793,I would never mess with someone's stuff...Even people that completely irritate me!
964160,manitoubass2,2016-03-28 00:36:00,11391,Good man?  Sending my love???
964169,smitty55,2016-03-28 01:37:00,928,Rick I'm thinking that your nasty neighbour got someone to sabotage  your vehicles. But as mentioned it's probably bad gas. Try a bottle of gas line antifreeze first.  Cheers
964180,manitoubass2,2016-03-28 04:19:00,11391,"EC is helping me out!(thanks bud!)  I hope thats not the case lol. Id prefer not to think that way.  Funny thing is, everyone I in this area gasses up at the same spot(including our work trucks) so it does kinda make the mind wander abit.  But who knows? Maybe its just crap luck/bad timing and something unrelated all together.  We shall see on tuesday"
964181,GBW,2016-03-28 04:27:00,8460,"Glad to hear he's willing to offer free advise as he is MY mechanic and helps me out all the time, and is a great fishing bud too!"
964182,manitoubass2,2016-03-28 04:32:00,11391,Yessir! It is very much appreciated.  I ever head up your way we'll have to share a boat!  Thanks to you too GBW!
964184,Smokercrafty,2016-03-28 07:15:00,227,"Picture this scenario, where i work, at a shop rate of almost $130, could you imagine telling a customer we ""think"" it's bad fuel, so we'll start with a fuel sample, break the locking clip for the fuel line, and now tell the customer we haven't figured anything out yet, but to start, we need to order a fuel line. God knows how expensive parts are nowadays.  Hope you solve your issues Manitoubass.... I'd be interested in knowing the outcome.  I was just giving you the steps we follow to triage issues."
