966081,Sinker,2016-04-11 19:25:00,8692,Happy and legal are two different things though.  Do I have to count canned ducks as part of my possession? What about rabbits? I am not sure.  What If I make them into pepperettes or jerky? Are they still considered to be part of my possession limits? Whats the difference with canned meats?  S.
966082,BillM,2016-04-11 19:27:00,17367,It's a great question to ask.   Personally I think if it's still in your possession it counts (No difference then having a freezer stuffed full of fish)  shouldn't really matter if it's in a can or not.
966083,akaShag,2016-04-11 19:27:00,2073,"I am interested in hearing what MNR has to say as well. I can a lot of things, and wonder if it is still considered to be in possession once its canned.  I assumed your fish were considered processed, meaning prepared to eat. It kinda hard to can fish in a way that they are easily counted, so I would love to know what they say.  S. The issue is transport.  If you process the fish for immediate consumption, ie where you are staying, you do not have to prove to a CO the species, size and numbers.  If you transport jars of canned fish this is problematic.  As for your jars of fish at your house, yes they are considered to be part of your possession limit, same as fish in your freezer.  In practice it would be exceptionally unlikely that a CO would inspect your freezer.  But last time I looked, the only peace officers that had the power to search without a warrant were COs.  To the best of my knowledge, nobody has taken that ""Charter of Rights and Freedoms"" challenge to a court with jurisdiction.  It is basically impossible that a Charter challenge would fail, provided appeals courts would give leave to appeal.  That might cost the person who was charged an enormous amount in legal fees, of course...."

965085,cl_fishin,2016-04-03 21:29:00,138,"I saw alot of interest in Whitefish through the ice over the winter, so I thought I would share some pics/info on how we target them in the openwater. Each fall a group of us travel north to camp and fish a variety of lakes/rivers, for a variety of fish species (Brook Trout, Walleyes, Pike, Salmon), and one of my favorite parts of the trip are when we target Whities. These fish are plentiful , fight hard, and are excellent healthy (high Omega 3 content) table fare if eaten fresh or canned (I find freezing them turns them to mush). As the water cools in the fall these fish will move into the bays to take advantage of shallow water forage, which makes them a lot easier to target then when warmer temps keep them out schooling over vast deepwater flats. We look for them in 15-20 FOW in mucky/sand bottom bays out beyond the deepest weedline edge, where they will be feeding on nymphs, minnows, worms etc. Using our centerpin Steelhead outfits we present tiny ice jigs with waxworms with sensitive slip floats a few feet off bottom, the long rods are important to pick up enough line quickly on the hookset to stick these light biters. Here are a few pics from last fall and a very old video,  I hope to redo the video this fall documenting the canning process better.......canned/jarred Whitefish is amazing              Here is the very old video, and the picture quality is poor, but the info is still good. I do hope to redo/update it with some of my newer gear, and better explain the canning process. Because its an old video I apologize for the ""plug"" at the end, but that jig doesn't exist anymore anyway  "

965342,Joeytier,2016-04-05 18:13:00,3990,"Awesome stuff.  Would love to try putting this into practice,  just tough to find lakes with a strong population of them, since no one around here targets them.  How did you guys get onto this technique?"
965379,cl_fishin,2016-04-06 02:29:00,138,"Awesome stuff. Would love to try putting this into practice, just tough to find lakes with a strong population of them, since no one around here targets them. How did you guys get onto this technique?  We learned the basics of the technique from some older guys that camped on one of the lakes we fish ( I have learned to listen closely to old guys,... a lot of wisdom comes with those grey hairs). We then refined it abit combining some newer tackle components, like slimmer more sensitive floats, jig styles, Fluorocarbon leaders, and a few other tweeks. But realistically the biggest challenge is finding areas the fish are using. The nice thing about Whities they often surface, jump and swirl on top when in shallow water feeding and give away their locations, spending time driving around with your graph will help you find them too, but again this time of year we always look for mucky areas outside of weedbeds in fairly large bays. Most lakes that have Whitefish tend to have lots of them, as they are rarely pressured too hard"

I would really like to try them in June again when the big flies are hatching, surface action just at dark is a lot of fun, they often cruise just under the surface and you can see their backs cutting through the surface at times"

Fillets we did not eat at camp, bringing them home rather than throwing them out (also an offence of course), and you can't put skin back ON to a skinned fillet....  the CO did not see things that way and my buddy paid a fine for half a dozen crappie fillets."
965683,Musky or Specks,2016-04-07 22:26:00,2710,My trips to Labrador @ the Canada Day weekend the whitefish are going crazy for flies. Hard to get a good drift for the Ouananiche and brookies when you flies dont even drift 3 ft down river and you have two or three whiteys on at once( I fish three flies on a line when allowed. Also have had great dry fly action for them in the evening on Manitou Lake in Algonquin @ the 24.
