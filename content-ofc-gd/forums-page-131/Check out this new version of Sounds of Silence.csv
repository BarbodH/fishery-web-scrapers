965511,misfish,2016-04-06 22:40:00,29133,Just watched this off of Conan.  Live is awesome.  
965513,Terry,2016-04-06 22:59:00,14456,"just had to make me listen to it again didn't you I really did not want to like it I consider Paul Simon more then just  a singer song writer hes a poet and a story teller and more he wrote that song in the 60s when folk music was in and the way to tell a story I loved the song this now has a harder edge to the song and damn it ,it was done every well so I guess Im saying I like it"
965514,irishfield,2016-04-06 23:00:00,26272,LOL

I think of all songs that have been redone, this one is right at the top.  Wonder if he can do an Elvis song?"
965545,leaf4,2016-04-07 01:27:00,2466,"Live version is even better than the recorded one!  I'm liking David dramains new direction in music (second band to Disturbed called device) and this.  I saw them in 2012 at HeavyMTL and I will be seeing them again this summer at the same festival, should be good!"
965554,smitty55,2016-04-07 01:47:00,928,"Just listened to different parts of it and didn't care for it all. All the same monotone and too slow. I still have the 45, and the flac album. But to each their own eh.  Cheers"
965661,BassMan11,2016-04-07 20:26:00,583,The live version is better and it is very well done. But........... come on
