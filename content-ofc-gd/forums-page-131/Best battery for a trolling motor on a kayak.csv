It weighs a little more than a tonne but I'll guarantee you it'll last pretty much a full day pushing a kayak around with a full charge. I go for 4-5 hours at a time and hook it up to the charger when I get home and it's barely under half charge, and that's running it pretty much constantly when I'm on the water. Priced right too."

965415,Acountdeleted,2016-04-06 14:13:00,2562,"Hey guys,  Although it doesn't look like spring is coming with the weather we are having, I want to get prepped. The missus has told me that she refuses to get in my kayak again until I replace the Trolling motor battery (the old one stranded us on the wrong side of the lake too many times.)  I was wondering what you lads say is the best one for this instance. Preferably we would like one that can be run for longer periods of time as its our main method of propulsion. If there are any ones that can push a trolling motor for 4 hours off of a single charge that would be ideal.  http://www.canadiantire.ca/en/pdp/motomaster-nautilus-group-27-starting-deep-cycle-battery-0102799p.html#.VwUZV_krKM8  I think this was the brand I was using before and it was ok. As always, trying to save a few bucks. Its becoming apparent at this point it may have been easier and cheaper just to get a a 2.5 HP gas motor from bass pro.   Edit: Our trolling Motor is a Minn Kota Endura C2 with 30 lbs of thrust."

965417,John Bacon,2016-04-06 14:37:00,3277,"The bigger and heavier the battery, the longer the charge will last.  The 800 number in red on the left gives you an indication of the charge that the battery can hold.  It is usually proportional to the size and weight of battery.I have had better luck with Walmart and Costco batteries than I have had with Canadian Tire batteries.Recharge the battery as soon as possible after use and keep the fluids topped up (preferably with distilled water)."

965421,John Bacon,2016-04-06 14:48:00,3277,Remove the caps (rectangler ones on top of the battery in your link) and pour distilled water in.The plates should be completely covered with water.  I usually fill to the bottom of the cylinder at the bottom of the cap (you should be able to see what I mean once the cap is off).  There will be six different cells to check.  I don't have to fill them very often.Some of the more expensive batteries are sealed won't have removable caps.

Would be nice to save the $200 or so I'm looking to invest.  I don't mind the weight too much. The 12' Frontier that I have once held me and 2 of my 200 lb buddies. Me and the missus wouldn't sink this thing if the battery were the size of the boat.
965433,porkpie,2016-04-06 15:36:00,2521,Walmart Grp 24 on my nucanoe frontier 12.  Should easily push you for 4 hours of moderate use.

The last straw was when we were about 10km away from the launch on Rice Lake last year. The motor died so we started paddling. She was a trooper but about 30 minutes in called it quits. So I paddled while she trolled."

965477,Acountdeleted,2016-04-06 19:14:00,2562,Launching the boat is expensive. Hence why I got a kayak. Hence why I'm looking for the best deal on a battery.
