A 2015 internal audit found that the law firm knew the identities of the real owners of just 204 of 14,086 companies it had incorporated in Seychelles, a tax haven in the Indian Ocean.""  Some people are looking for a rock to crawl under. WTG Iceland."

965563,scuro2,2016-04-07 02:42:00,904,"The CRA is like a dog on a bone with info like this. It's not just a bank account # but rather 90 million documents were dumped. I have no doubt there are a few voluntary confessions happening with the CRA right now. The CRA will also love this on the deterrent angle, they will go that extra mile. Cheaters will always cheat but it aint no long term money making strategy!  "

965732,glen,2016-04-08 03:09:00,2641,"""Say you own a mining company, for example, and have concerns about one day being sued for potential environmental problems. Keeping money stashed away in a trust can potentially stop future creditors from getting everything. But offshore trusts offer an extra layer of protection.""  So hide your money so you don't have to pay what your sued for. Go to jail."
965733,irishfield,2016-04-08 03:18:00,26272,"Just an extra layer Glen. You can do the same thing with funds and not even leave Canada, just put them into a Life Insurance company's investment fund with a named beneficiary. Nobody can touch them even if you decide to claim bankruptcy. It's nothing new and a common theme for anyone that takes that big life gamble and takes all their hard earned savings and starts a new business."

965736,irishfield,2016-04-08 03:26:00,26272,"Remember there is nothing illegal about making 10 million dollars in Canada, paying your taxes on it and then taking what is left over and putting it in a bank account in Antigua, Isle of Man, etc, or apparently Panama and letting it sit there. If they're not paying you interest there is no fowl."
