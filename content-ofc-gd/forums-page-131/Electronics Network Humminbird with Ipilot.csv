I am reading I will need a hub for this setup, but cant find much info on how to set these components work together. I assume the two Sonar will be on the starting battery and the trolling motor on its own. Any help with wiring / network set up or diagram would be a great help.  Thanks in advance for your time, effort and knowledge.  Dave"
