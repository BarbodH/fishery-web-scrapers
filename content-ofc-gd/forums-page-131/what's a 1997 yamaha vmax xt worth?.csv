Please view this ad:  97 Yamaha v-max 500xt for sale or trade , http://www.kijiji.ca/v-snowmobile/hamilton/97-yamaha-v-max-500xt-for-sale-or-trade/1152263259   Thanks for any and all input as I really have no clue!

965887,chris.brock,2016-04-09 18:02:00,4053,$1500-$2000?  I agree.  Ask him how many kms.  Still a very tough sell this time of the year.
965902,Joeytier,2016-04-09 22:16:00,3990,"Vmaxs are great sleds that whole their value pretty well, one of those in excellent shape with bigger liquid cooled motor could probably fetch 2500+, but since it's fancooled I wouldn't pay more than 2 in late fall, wouldn't pay more than 1500 right now.  Good sled though"
965912,Sinker,2016-04-10 00:12:00,8692,I was going to say 1-2000 bucks.
965920,leaf4,2016-04-10 01:29:00,2466,"Decent, maybe something to consider to flip for some cash cause I don't even have $1000 invested into my canoe setup,maybe 700 so that's a pretty good return...  Thanks boys"
