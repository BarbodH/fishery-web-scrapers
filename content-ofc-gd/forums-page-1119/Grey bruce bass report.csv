135196,DANIMAL,2007-11-20 22:58:00,215," I fished a small lake in the grey bruce area yesterday. I know this lake really well, been fishing it my whole life. There are 2 spots where 30 fow cuts in a little bit closer to the main dropoff where almost all the big smallmouth winter. Got out on the water and took a temp. 39 F. Perfect, the smallies would be in there wintering spots.<BR>Fished my first spot and cought about 15 and they started getting tough. So I tried my other spot and cought about 10 and they got tough. Whent back to the first spot and cought a few more then packed it in because it was getting dark. All fish were 2.5-5.0 lbs The fish were not picky. They hit almost anything as long as it was presented slow and on bottom. I kept track of my 5 biggest just for fun 4.2/4.2/4.4/4.4/5.0=22.2 lbs. My best small lake bass day yet.  http://i239.photobucket.com/albums/ff1/dano44/100_0131.jpg  http://i239.photobucket.com/albums/ff1/dano44/100_0130.jpg  http://i239.photobucket.com/albums/ff1/dano44/100_0129.jpg  http://i239.photobucket.com/albums/ff1/dano44/100_0128.jpg  http://i239.photobucket.com/albums/ff1/dano44/100_0121.jpg  http://i239.photobucket.com/albums/ff1/dano44/100_0123.jpg  http://i239.photobucket.com/albums/ff1/dano44/100_0125.jpg  http://i239.photobucket.com/albums/ff1/dano44/100_0126.jpg"
