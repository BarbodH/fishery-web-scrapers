The fishing was tough, with few caught... and well today was a bit rough on the bones...  Had it not have been for the great company (friends) It would have been miserable the whole time...  what a disaster of a lodge...  but we all persevered and made the best of it!!  it was nice to see that EVERYONE got out fishing that wanted too... and everyone was well fed on Saturday... man what a feast!!!  again Shawn, it was nice to meet you and I would be more then happy to fish with you anytime...
