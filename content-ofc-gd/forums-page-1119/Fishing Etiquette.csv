135103,Kirk,2007-11-20 18:47:00,347,"Actually PF, its FLOGGING a dead horse.  I wondered where the phrase beating a dead horse originated from...I should have known as I still have a Sex Pistols album in the basement  Beating a dead horse From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to: navigation, search ""Flogging a dead horse"" redirects here. For the Sex Pistols album, see Flogging a Dead Horse. Look up beat a dead horse in Wiktionary, the free dictionary.Beating a dead horse is an idiom which means a particular request or line of conversation is already foreclosed, mooted, or otherwise resolved, and any attempt to continue it is futile. In British English, the phrase is usually rendered as flogging a dead horse.  The first recorded use of the expression with its modern meaning is by British politician and orator John Bright, referring to the Reform Bill of 1867, which called for more democratic representation in Parliament, and which Parliament was singularly apathetic about. Trying to rouse Parliament from its apathy on the issue, he said in a speech, would be like trying to flog a dead horse to make it pull a load. The Oxford English Dictionary cites the Globe, 1872, as the earliest verifiable use of flogging a dead horse ,  For..twenty minutes..the Premier..might be said to have rehearsed that..lively operation known as flogging a dead horse. [1]   [edit] Earlier meaning There are claims that the phrase originates in 17th century slang, where a ""dead horse"" was work that was paid for in advance, e.g. ""His land 'twas sold to pay his debts; All went that way, for a dead horse, as one would say.""[2]. Unfortunately, the Smythe quotation is a red herring. He was simply referring to what was already known as the ""dead horse month"", or the month of no pay, and how difficult it was to get work out of the men during the dead horse month.[citation needed] This attribution confuses ""flogging a dead horse"" with an entirely different phrase - ""to work (for) the dead horse"". This phrase was slang for ""work charged before it is executed"". This use of 'dead horse' to refer to pay that was issued before the work was done was simply an allusion to using one's money to buy a useless thing (metaphorically, "" a dead horse""). Most men paid in advance apparently either wasted the money on drink or other such vices or used it to pay debts.  Historically, it was common practice to pay a ship's crewmen in advance for their first month's work, which they would usually have spent prior to even boarding the ship on which they were to work. For the first month on board, therefore, they felt as though they were working for nothing, and so they were not terribly motivated. After approximately one month, ships out of the British Isles reached the Horse Latitudes. The problem here is that there is no mention by Smythe of the Horse Latitudes or any explanation of why he supposedly used the phrase ""flogging a dead horse"".

134838,Bojangles,2007-11-20 01:03:00,46,"If you are a Steelheader or not... you should know what I call ""THE ROUTINE"".  If guys are crowded up in a pool and they are 5' or so away from eachother it wouldn't be a bad situation at all. You just simply cast in order from the guy at the bottom of the run to the one who is at the top. I remember fishing in a crowded area with 7 experienced steelheaders along the rock wall at the icebreakers (guess the river) and none of us got into a tangle for 2 straight hours of fishing. I noticed that those who don't know 'the routine' and come into a crowd really screw up drifting time until they leave.  Have respect for others. I normally go up to someone kindly and I ask if I could join them in fishing a pool or a run. When they do say yes we usually get caught up in a conversation and we just drift casually.  Show some respect on the riverbank and you'll earn your spot on a drift."
133050,Basskicker,2007-11-13 03:23:00,421,"I have NEVER said anything negative before on ANY board and I hate to rant, but..........  I realise that I DO NOT own the river, or the spot for that matter.  However a little fishing etiquette (respect for other anglers) on your part would be greatly appreciated in the future.  We both know that fish hold in that ENTIRE stretch of river, you could probably put 50-60 anglers one one side of that river........why is it that you and your friend choose to fish so close when there is over 500ft of shoreline?  You guys simply walked up, and through your lines in right where we were fishing like we never even existed.  You impeded on my drift on several occasions.  You were that close that if I set the hook to the left I would have hit you.  As you say....."" Lots of room to fish down there and I didnt have any idea I was intruding on your space? kinda limited room to cast from there but an ample amount fo water.""   You have to remeber there is MAYBE 15' of land to cast to that spot. I dont see it as greasing at all when there is a good 120' of water to drift...not like its shoulder to shoulder""  These are your words, exact same situation on 2 different days with 2 different people.  Limited room to cast?  Come on man, there's an entire section of river.  I can't speak for others, only myself.  Maybe a simple hello, how's it going......do you mind if we fish here....would go along way.  Listen man, just have a little respect for others on the river, treat other's like you would like to be treated.  As for the pics.......if you can recognize the river and the spot from the pics then you have already been there before.  I'll be down there all day Wednesday if you would like to join me.   Enough about that.....I've been working on some new custom handpoured baits lately....what do you think?      Jason"
133051,JerseyDog,2007-11-13 03:26:00,190,"Last month I was fishing for salmon in BC. For most of the trip we were pretty spread out but on the last day we headed up to the ""Limit Hole"" which was the last fishable pool before the sanctuary.  Anyway, I've never seen anything crazier. There were fisherman every 5 feet or less casting into this pool. It was like a war zone. You'd see 10 casts fire out at the same time and as they floated down, another 10 would go right over them.  For a while, FISH ON would get everyone to bring in their lines but as the light started to wane, people just kept firing their casts over everything.  There was lines in the water, casts from both banks, triple headers, huge fish randomly jumping through the whole mess, tangled lines, fish being landed, gutted, cooked, guys going, more guys coming, etc. It was a total zoo.  And the best part was, maybe there was 50+ guys there, and not only locals but tourists as well, from all points on the globe and with all the tangled lines, casting over someone else's line, etc. in five hours or more, I did not see one person get the least bit upset. They'd just untangle you, or you would untangle them and keep casting.  The salmon (maybe three species of them and HUGE) were stacked 10 deep in this pool and it was smiles all around.  As much as its hard to believe, it was about as much fun as I have had fishing in years."
133053,huey graphite,2007-11-13 03:27:00,362,"Nate,  Over the past week I have read many threads that turn into pi$$ing matches and the common denominator has been your involvement. Rather than, just going away, why don't you stick around,  try to co-operate and you'd be surprised at what you can learn from this great bunch on OFNers."
133054,solopaddler,2007-11-13 03:30:00,8605,"Okaaay....maybe it was personal  . Hey Jason, check your pm's bud."
133055,Nater,2007-11-13 03:30:00,68,"Sure there is plenty of water but we both know that the area you guys were fishing is the holding spot and there isn't much room... Like you said you don't own the river so I dont see how we should have asked permission?  I think there is plenty of room down there for lots of guys to fish as it isn't exactly a fast flow.  All depends what you call ettiquette, had the shoe been on the other foot I could care less if you guys wanted to come down and fish off the point, and i wouldnt be upset if you didnt choose to tell me your lifes story because not everyone is social.  Nate  I'm sure I'll see ya wednesday"
133056,ccmtcanada,2007-11-13 03:31:00,7971,"Jason...I have to admit that I couldn't figure out why they decided to fish literally 5 feet from you either that day I was with you, when we were the only two on that entire stretch of water.  But then again, some people I dont understand.  Those plastics look amazing!!!  Imagine if they work...never having to tie roe bags ever again!!!"
133145,Kirk,2007-11-13 15:22:00,347,"This thread is the reason why God created BOATS, I could elaborate further."
133153,Rich,2007-11-13 16:36:00,3927,Wow great advice Bunk. Just beat up whoever annoys you. That would make the fishing community look even better wouldn't it. Jesus christ.
133154,solopaddler,2007-11-13 16:37:00,8605, I agree. He also gave us a mind and a pair of feet. We all have the option of walking further to find solitude....
