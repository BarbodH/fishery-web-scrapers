134508,Loonietoon,2007-11-19 01:13:00,1450,If you are willing to travel to Caledonia??? you will get better service at Grand River Vets.. Been taking my dogs there for over 15 years.. very caring hospital even call to check on your animals after Surgery... more than my surgeon ever did when I had surgery.. go figure
134526,Corey,2007-11-19 01:49:00,355,"When I lived at home, we took my sisters cats to the place across from Fiesta Mall, if that place exists. Somewhere right near the Dairy Queen, they did a very good job on the cats for what we were getting done. The recovery time was almost nothing.  I can't say any of the dogs have ever been there though."
134529,Gerritt,2007-11-19 02:01:00,6129,  I would second Grand River Veterinarian clinic.  I grew up in Mount hope and had dogs all my life (til' marriage).. they are good folks and were always fair and respectful.  Gerritt.  PS... I hope that beauty of a lab makes it out just fine... she is a good looking ol' gal.

134609,Spiel,2007-11-19 11:24:00,9065,....As a new dog owner in east Hamilton I've had my pup at Kingsway Animal Hospital (1770 King St. East) three times this past month. Service has been top notch though I have nothing else to compare it too. I've heard that they may be a tad pricier than others but it's close to home.
