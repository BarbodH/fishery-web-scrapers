134731,douG,2007-11-19 19:03:00,2693,"Glen left Merland Park around 11 am on Sunday morning.  He seemed refreshed, with intelligent plans to take it easy on the way home, even spending the night in a hotel.  With a total driving time of about 22 hours, we might see a post from him late tonight, but more likely sometime tomorrow."
