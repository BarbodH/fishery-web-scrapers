Photos to come once I finish off the role of film.  I just got a bow from a friend to use for the rest of the season.  Does anyone know if I can buy an additional deer tag still.  Fire up the Grill & Plug in the 2nd Freezer !! It's Hunting Season !! Entropy  ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++    Got My First Deer Yesterday !!  I managed to leave work at a fair time yesterday and got to my deer hunting grounds.  I was there for an hour watching 2 fields.  One I have permission to hunt and the other I do not.  I was keeping my attention on the field which I had permission to hunt and then all of a sudden a deer shows up in the next field!  It took her about 10 seconds to move on and she was on legal ground!!   I lined the shot up but at first did not have a safe backstop  so I lowered my shotgun and then she was gone, and reappeared just past a small clump of trees, now with a perfect backstop.  I had the backstop, a good ‘vitals shot’ and took it.  Success! She quickly went down.  I’ll post the pics once I get them off the 35 mm film.  Fire up the Grill, It’s Hunting Season !! Entropy"
