It was starting to freez over in the calm water and the water temp in the main river was only 32-33 F.    I tried a number of different baits and tekniques and the only thing I could get them to bite was a tube dragged really slowly but steady on bottom. They would bite only the tentacles on dark or solid colours, but would eat subtle or transparent colours. I ended up hooking 4. and landing 2 both nice ones at 18'' and 19''.  The 19'' "

134711,Mike Pike,2007-11-19 17:19:00,1332,"I noticed that pattern several weeks ago on a Grand trib in the KW area.  They definately don't wanna chase anthing fast but still wanna eat.  Switching to a tube jig( rigged weedless )and dragging it slowly on the bottom caught a few fish for me too.  Not as big as your two beauts yesterday, though!  Congratulations and thanks for the report and pics!"
