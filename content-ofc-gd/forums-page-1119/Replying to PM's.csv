134398,Beats,2007-11-18 14:49:00,543,I second Ron's reply and I am almost positive that this is what your problem is.  I have also done it in the past.  The carbon copy box just appears to be the appropriate size for typing your message body so you don't bother scrolling down to see that the actual assigned box is further down.  I've done it a few times myself.
