The only cell phone number that I had was Bill Parker's and I called and got his voice mail and wanted to let everyone know that I could not attend for Sunday morning.  I was pleased to see everyone Friday night and it certainly was a pleasure to meet new OFners well at least new to me.  Whenever you are coming to the area send me a PM and I will see what we can do to get together and do some fishing and swap some stories.  Best regards, Sam"
