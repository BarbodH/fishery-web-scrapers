Been out once this year and that was the weekend after opening day lol....  Anyway, i'm glad to be back and will be hopefully fishing soon now that Izzy's a little older. I'd post pics but I can't figure out how to do it on the new board lol....  Take Care   Dave  formerly known as Kitfisher"

Also I'm glad to hear you finished your training, how's the new job?  Where abouts are you working?  Looking forward to your reports.  Maureen"

Unfortunately I missed a lot of the important stuff while I was gone. i was there though for the first ultrasound and the birth, but everything else I missed. I do feel guilty about it but there are some sacrifices that we all have to make and fortunately my wife was very understanding lol...  I work out of markham and during my patrols i've found a few nice spots on the Rouge River......haven't fished though lol"

I don't make it out to Markham much these days, but if you see a grey sportage with my name on the plates, say hi   As for posting pics, it's fairly easy... just look Here it should help you.  How's the sports memorabillia sales going?  Maureen"
