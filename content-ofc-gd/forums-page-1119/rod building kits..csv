But if you if you don't mind shopping online there seems to be plenty of options here....http://shop.mudhole.com/s.nl/it.I/id.67/.f  As for help, I'd be happy to help. You can PM me any questions you may have."
134634,MJL,2007-11-19 12:58:00,2427,"Angling Specialties sells basic stands, motors and components.  They mostly sell Sage and Lamiglas blanks but I'm sure they could order other blanks if you ask.  Mudhole and Cabelas are other options."
