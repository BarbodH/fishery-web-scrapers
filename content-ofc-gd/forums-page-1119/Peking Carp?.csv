134182,dsn,2007-11-16 20:01:00,1018,Yesterday I was out searching for pike with no luck. So I went to check out a carp location I used to fish. I wasn't sure if there was any carp there at this time of year. As many tell me the carp has moved deeper into the warmer waters. But I decided to give it a try. It was a cold morning wind 27km/hr and a -3 degrees.  Chummed a bit. The water was so clear that you can even see the corn to the right of this bush. You can even make out where the bollies are and what colors they were.   Nothing like radio active corn. This was the second location I chummed. (below)   Then I seen a shadow move in. Cause the clouds moved in also and everything was dark. Then this white stuff started coming down.   Move white stuff. The carp took the bait and slowly moved half an inch. The rod slowly bends. I set the hook and the fight was on!! Or was it? The thing didn't fight must at all. A slow tug and the battle was over. It didn't even go for a 5 foot run.  Couple twists here and there and the battle was over.       All the shots above was exactly how the battle played out. Its like fishing for catfish. I guess I'll leave these guys alone. Their no fun anymore. Not to mention extra slimmy. They weren't this slimmy in the summer. I could bearly hold him up.  Then these fellows moved in and my day was over. I guess with the clear water they can spot the corn from the CN Tower.  There goes the dive bombs!!   Hey MJL remember this guy?  How's about now?  I decided to make the best of it so here comes the peking duck pictures.    I thought some action shots would be cool.      By the time they got though my chum muddy waters was the result. Couldn't see a thing.   Dinner time.

134203,dsn,2007-11-16 21:50:00,1018,  yeah they look alot better on a hook than they do in water. 
134204,dsn,2007-11-16 21:51:00,1018,"  yeah after I landed that one, I said ok time to go. LOL "

134226,007,2007-11-17 01:53:00,537,Nice duck shots!  Never seen a carp caught while its snowing - you're a hardcore carp addict!  I had given up catching a fish from the GTA now the cold weather is upon us - but maybe I should head down your way for some carp after all!  Is that where I think it is? I won't say a thing.   :closedeyes:  007

134418,mikeh,2007-11-18 20:03:00,824,Great action shots with the fish. also is there something stuck in that one ducks beak?
134428,dsn,2007-11-18 21:37:00,1018,  There's always 2008 
134430,dsn,2007-11-18 21:39:00,1018, Well lets say if they dive for food they are liable to pick up the wrong peice of corn. Then  to fly way.
