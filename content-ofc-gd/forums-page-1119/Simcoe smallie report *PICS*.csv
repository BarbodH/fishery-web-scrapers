Ah what the hell, 5 people on the boat, I've seen crazier, and the boat is rated for it.  We drove up to Simcoe to do some smallie fishin, and I remember why I love Simcoe and why I love smallie fishin.  No real big fish today, but enough to keep everyone entertained.  Tubes in about 35 feet of water did the job today.  We caught fish shallower, but they were all very small, and too many perch nibblin away, deeper was the way to go.   Kelli with a couple   Robyn with her first Simcoe smallie   myself with a couple average size fish.  Like I said, no tanks today, but it sure felt good to get into a few of them.  Its not very often that Simcoe is that calm this time of year."
