134648,rhare,2007-11-19 14:13:00,387,"great report man, always look forward to see'in how you did on the weekend!"
134663,solopaddler,2007-11-19 15:10:00,8605, Thanks for the laugh bud
134665,ehg,2007-11-19 15:13:00,2666," Some of those photos are magnificent.  Good to see you sharing.  Thanks,  ehg"
134667,bigfish1965,2007-11-19 15:18:00,3382," If this was sarcasm, here's an idea....keep it to yourself. I'm pretty sick of this kind of crap. There's a very small group of troutters who are so insanely xenophobic and  completely insecure that I have to wonder about your mental health. If this was not sarcasm, please ignore the previous sentence."
134669,tbayboy,2007-11-19 15:22:00,1497,Beautiful pictures again and the report just exudes the excitement you felt.  Please don't let some paranoid fools ruin it for the rest of us that love reading reports like this.  Oh and PM me the GPS co-ords when you get a sec ok
134677,solopaddler,2007-11-19 15:38:00,8605," Oh it was, he made it abundantly clear via the pm last night   .  The thing is I ""think"" I know who the guy is and criticism of any sort from him is laughable. Rolls off my back like water on a duck.... Me? I'm not just a steelheader. I have just as much passion for pretty much every single freshwater fish. I love fishing, and if I take pride in anything it's being a multi-species angler.  These elitist guys that have blinders on for everything but steelhead, own 25 float rods and every fancy float reel that comes down the pipe, and then get bent out of shape when they see a post like this......well I've got no time for crap like that either. If I was naming trib's or posting backgrounds, then fine fire away, but c'mon otherwise get a life!"
134680,Bly,2007-11-19 15:42:00,1556,Beautiful pictures Mike.....really enjoyed them and the report...awesome to have days like that!
134685,Lefty,2007-11-19 15:49:00,14,Great Report and pics. What a great way to start the week.  Thanks for sharing.  L.
134741,Paulus,2007-11-19 20:00:00,522," Not that far from it, really. I've been fishing with Mike well over 10 years and his knowledge and skill in the art of catching steelhead are nothing short of professional. But Mike is also a great all-round fisherman, for all the species that are available in Ontario and Quebec.  I also feel envious when I see all those pics and all those fish, because I wish it was me  But they are very tastefully presented, with no backgrounds to give away where they were caught.  So, get out there yourself & catch a few. It will help ease your pain!  Regards, p.-"
134757,aniceguy,2007-11-19 21:16:00,1094,"Been on quite a few trips with Mike, the guy is honest to a fault, generous beyond belief and can pound the snot out of those fish.....The drives are classic as Mike has seen more Ontario water then much of us combined and his recounts of some of the trips make the drive well worth it.  Anyone fishing with Mike for a day understands the deal...Nice Pics Mike!!"
134759,solopaddler,2007-11-19 21:23:00,8605,Enough already......please  .
134791,steve_paul,2007-11-19 22:47:00,658,"Great report Mike, Thanks."
134793,Roy,2007-11-19 22:52:00,13728,"Just a super report, Mike. I know you're not the type to let anyone get you down. Just remember that 99.99999% of the folks here love your reports."

134811,Joey,2007-11-19 23:44:00,9122,Man what beautiful fish.  Very well done  I'm kinda starting to like the month of November myself  Great report and awesome pictures.  Joey
134462,solopaddler,2007-11-18 23:38:00,8605,"Man oh man I love the month of November! We had a bit of a drive this weekend so we decided to leave Friday evening for our destination: Fleabag Motel located amidst steelhead central, LOL! The place was a bit of a rathole, but hey it's somewhere to hang your hat, a great place to socialize with other fishermen, and we were nice and fresh for the onslaught which ensued Saturday morning  . The river had risen due to snowmelt a couple of days before and we were hitting it on the drop, bang on the nose. Couldn't ask for better timing really...... Saturday started a wee bit slow due to the turbid water, but by around 10am right through both days it was fish after fish with many double and triple headers. Initially fish were caught on oversized chartreuse ""choker"" bags because of the water clarity. Once things cleared up pretty much anything you wanted to use caught fish, LOL! I used and did indeed catch a bunch of fish on Jason's (Basskicker on the board) hand poured steelhead baits. Thanks buddy they were awesome! The egg clusters caught a few fish, but the pink worms were killer!  Here's a few pic's from the weekend:                                                                            Lots of fish in pristine surroundings and a lot of laughs shared with a couple of good friends. It just doesn't get any better!  Cheers,  Mike"
134463,mattyk,2007-11-18 23:40:00,2110,"wow, looks like a great trip! Thanks for sharing with us."

134471,mikeh,2007-11-18 23:54:00,824,"fantastic shots showing the colors of the fish, I really like the zoom in shots, thanks for sharing."

134487,Rainbow nut,2007-11-19 00:44:00,3,You're the best steelheader ever. Wow.
134495,solopaddler,2007-11-19 00:55:00,8605,
134500,fatherof3,2007-11-19 00:59:00,1769,"great report and fish,congrats on another good outing"
134515,wuchikubo,2007-11-19 01:30:00,1114,"Obviously another awesome outing.  Since I got skunked today on BOQ, those pics are going to keep me awake thinking, I should have gone chrome hunting.  Thanks Mike for the post."
134541,PatrickGG,2007-11-19 02:24:00,562,"Wow! Thats a fun 2 good days of fishing, Thanks for sharing those nice pics and some nice looking hens."
134544,danc,2007-11-19 02:27:00,4677,Just awesome Mike. You are the man!!!
134549,FishFinder,2007-11-19 02:40:00,481," Dont let them get you down mike, I enjoy reading your reports and do think you are an awesome steelheader. Experience shows."
134567,MJL,2007-11-19 03:15:00,2427,Catching that many fish should be illegal!  Fantastic report as always SP.
134569,ccmtcanada,2007-11-19 03:19:00,7971,"Mike...you did it again!!!  Wow...awesome fish there again.  Oh yeah....rain on Tues, Wed and Thurs...where we fishing this week??? LOL  Congrats....must have been really cool landing all those fish!"
134621,solopaddler,2007-11-19 12:13:00,8605," Not looking for kudos, but thanks. Nothing more than being excited about my trip and wanting to share, (a least with some of you). Fact is I don't normally bother with this many pic's but one of my buddies this weekend is an excellent photograher and was willing and eager to take the pictures, something which rarely happens.  In any case the guy with the thinly veiled criticism pm'd me with a comment about all the extra crowds I'll be sending to the river.  I've recently attempted to post only pic's with no background....unless you were fishing with me on the weekend does anyone here really know for sure where I was? You might have an idea, but you'd most likely be wrong. I'd bet on it.  BTW, if anyone else has a problem with my posts I'd appreciate it if you were upfront with your criticism and why. Sarcasm is pretty obvious."
134628,b2kptbo,2007-11-19 12:37:00,1505,"Beauty, gotta like it..."
134640,Moosebunk,2007-11-19 13:30:00,3970,"Woweee Zoweee you're my Steelheader Jethro Tull Steel Monkey.  I can't believe that pathetic collection of rainbows.  I mean, c'mon... learn to fish man.  Why is it everytime you wet a line Mr. SuperSoloPaddler that you have to pass off 20 pics of the same fish your buddy obviously caught for you.  Do you and your little steelheading wizard friends; and that hobbit CCM, only fish at fish farms?  I'm looking soooooooooooooo forward to your next big false report there Solo-Izumi wannabe.  Borat says NOT!     "
134644,suds,2007-11-19 13:59:00,70,Few things are better than a weekend away steelheading with the buddies. Thanks for sharing your fun. Please keep it up!  cheers suds
134645,ccmtcanada,2007-11-19 14:00:00,7971," LOL Bunk.  Great.....why dont ya just tell everyone where I fish....geez.  Mind you, we dont get many visitors to the Shire, so I'm not too worried about it."
