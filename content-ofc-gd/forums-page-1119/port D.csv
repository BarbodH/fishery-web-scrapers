Saturday night the guys and I went down around 8PM on the east side, an abundant amount of fish jumping I have never seen anything like it, anyway hooked up my three way and attempted to perfect the bottom bouncing technique, not bad for a first timer lost a couple rigs.... Switched up to a Berkley power worm, pink in color FISH ON!!!!!! FISH GONE!!!!!!! broke my line I think maybe my knot skills weren't up to par for these giants...As the evening progressed the fish continued to put on an air show, a few guys joined the party and were getting lucky with the spoons, switched up aswell but skunked...... Midnight called it quits......5 am back down to port, thank god for Timmy ho's got there and I wasn't the only one with fishing on my mind cause there were a good number there already I was told this is normal..... I set up shop under the footbridge on the west side with the roe in tow but spent more time tyeing rigs then I did bouncing, got tired of it so I through some hardware on..... I saw lots of guys flashing with spoons so I did the same........ No luck again for me, but saw lots being caught I stayed till 1 pm and here is where the story gets good boys I was tossing around a 4 inch spoon and in between a cast I had got it tangled, as I tried to fix the line my glove caught one of the hooks in the process of unhooking myself I snapped a hook off and it seemed to move through the water a little funny but I was to lazy to change the spoon, I continued to pitch this crippled spoon into the water oh and by this time nobody was on the west side due to the fact that most of the fish that morning had been caught on the east side, I saw a man with a net that morning hauling in all the days catches for the boys I don't know if the pay this guy but he never fished I dont think and he grabbed for everyone, anyway so I got me a seat all by myself and as I was limping this spoon along out of nowhere a hugh steel head decided to give me a go so he grabs my spoon swims towards me then turned and went DOWN with the spoon at this point my line was no longer connected to the spoon, the fish took it and left me with the line blowin in the wind (sounds like a Dylan tune) once again the lesson here is learn to tie a good knot...... I spent last nite learning the rapala knot and the palomar knot Perfected!!!!!! heading to port friday nite for battle will post report if I survive......"
