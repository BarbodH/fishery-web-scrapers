Been into this sport since the age of 3 and now 17. My season seems finished this year as i usually fish in the Kawarthas unless if i go somewhere else.  I also have a question about how i can start fishing next year. The dams i have usually fished at opens the day when walleye season opens. Crappie and perch did happen to be open a month earlier than the walleye season, so where can i go to fish for crappie and perch? Do i have to be out on a boat? or be somewhere that is nowhere near a dam?  Thanks in Advance"

If you hang around here long enough, you just might meet some new mates to fish with and learn a few tips...some members will share places if you PM them but will not divulge the info here on the forum...I hope you understand why..."
134459,Rich,2007-11-18 23:30:00,3927,"Fish down here.. panfish & pike open year round, walleye has a longer season (I think it's closed for a month), lots of carp to keep you occupied as well.  Bass is open 15 days longer too  (til Nov 30th)"
