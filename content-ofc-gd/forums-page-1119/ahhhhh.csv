135165,BFSC Kevin,2007-11-20 21:51:00,1351,i know there is whitefish during the hardwater season that are easy to get... not too sure right now.. i haven't been there in a while.. how about the smallies right now? how they are doing around the keswick area? i could try and head out there.. .. since my entry was a largie...
