133595,Roy,2007-11-14 16:42:00,13728,Merland would know which cabin the Dawg is in. I also think that Sam might know. He can also bump the redneck's truck and the alarm will go off....instant redneck.
133618,Tybo,2007-11-14 17:32:00,1373,They put alarms on Fords? and what for?
133622,Whopper,2007-11-14 17:39:00,2174, Thought the same thing Paul but after looking at his ride and being a Chevy guy I thought is was really nice. Don't tell him that though
