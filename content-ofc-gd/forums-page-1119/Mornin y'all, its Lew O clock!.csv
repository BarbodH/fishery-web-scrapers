Gotta love newborns, have to admit, she is a cutie, wish I had a digital camera to show y'all.  Oh well, sick day tomorrow, whoops, I mean today, and if I'm lucky, some fishing this afternoon!  Have a great day.  Man, am I tired."

134942,BFSC Kevin,2007-11-20 10:08:00,1351,"Morning! Geez, I can't even believe I'm up at this time.. must be because of waking up three days in a row at the G2G at this time trying to get a early head start..."
134943,Hooked,2007-11-20 10:16:00,891,"  Hahahaha, dang, I missed it!  Don't know how you guys get up this early....on purpose.  Thanks.   yeah, its like I forgot, or purged it out of my memory from my first one, he's older now and he was well worth it 10000+fold already, and she will be too!  Can't believe it, just cracked open a beer to celebrate the hand-off to the wife, whew hooo!!!  I'm free, now I sleep, wake up, and fish.....yeah right.  But ya never know."
