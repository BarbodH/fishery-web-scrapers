134433,Corey,2007-11-18 22:12:00,355,"Hey HF,  Sorry nobody got back to you... it was a good time, but I don't think many of us will ever go back to Merland Park again. That is the most unorganized and poorly run and poorly maintained place I have ever been.  cd."
134434,lew,2007-11-18 22:22:00,12767,"Sounds like things have taken a downward turn since I was last there, sorry to hear that."
134439,Gerritt,2007-11-18 22:43:00,6129,"Lew,  It was complete and utter chaos... the words to describe it I cannot utter here...  In one word...(ok three)  screw you Merlands.  Gerritt."
134441,BFSC Kevin,2007-11-18 22:46:00,1351,"HEY HEY.. Gerrit, you're back already?  I just stepped into my girlfriend's in Scaborough...  Yeah.. Hearingfish, you don't want to head outt o merlands... no good.. peice of... but I had a good time meeting all the folks and putting the names to some faces! I'll post up a report soon once the pics get uploaded...  kevin... errr shall i change it to wally kev now?? lol.. i'm going to try to hit the BOQ again a couple times before storing the boat."
134449,Gerritt,2007-11-18 22:55:00,6129, give me a call when you have a weekend free... I wouldnt mind at all spending a couple of days fishing with yah..  if your boats not ready we'll use mine.  G.
134451,BFSC Kevin,2007-11-18 22:59:00,1351,"I'll see how the boat goes and my schedule... I'll probably just take the boat in to get the impeller changed, even if its not broken because I don't have a clue when the last time it was changed, been atleast 3 years so I might aswell change it now."
134452,Gerritt,2007-11-18 23:05:00,6129,ok man let me know
134520,wuchikubo,2007-11-19 01:39:00,1114,"The only reason I was looking for the coordinates was to meet up on the water, since my friend had decided to launch at the public launch in Picton.  I did manage to meet Fishnsled and Headhunter when I swung by at about 2:30pm.  I wish I could have gotten there earlier to say hello to the bunch.  We got on the water at about 8:30 am and fished until 2 pm, two stolen minnows on my buddy's drop shot rig, one light bump on my set up (plastic, and most likely a perch). My 7 year old son fell asleep on the boat waiting for some action that never happened.  Disappointing, 2 years in a row. Unfortunately, I don't think I'll be able to convince anyone (and probably myself) to try again next year. Too long of a drive, too inexperienced on the BOQ, and only able to make it on Sundays.  I hope Glen did catch a walleye, especially after such a long drive.  HF"
134521,Corey,2007-11-19 01:42:00,355,"I'm pretty sure some of us are going to do a summer trip for a weekend or long weekend up there next year HearingFish. We'll most likely stay at Mohawk Bay in Deseronto or on Hay Bay somewhere, place I am more familiar with. You are more than welcome to come up on the Sunday and fish with us. We'll get some fish up in the waters that I know.  Corey"
