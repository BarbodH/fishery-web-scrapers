134732,bucktail,2007-11-19 19:07:00,1857,"Depends on where you are going to be hunting. Find the local MNR office and they will tell you what seals are available. In some of the southern units you can purchase up to 7 tags for the year. These you have to buy at the office itself. Otherwise a standard deer tag will do. The ministry publishes there handout every year and can be found online here.....http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/MNR/pubs/pubmenu.html#hunting  Depending where you live the hunts are either , bow, shotgun or rifle.. Then you have to find some land to hunt on. Do some driving and polite knocking on doors and hhopefully soon you will be on your way!"
134736,Doop,2007-11-19 19:37:00,22,I actually live in Texas and was hoping to hunt either back home in Iowa or in Canada next year. I am really not interested in guided hunts...i'm more of a do-it-myselfer  I certainly don't mind doing a little friendly knocking because that's how I gained access when I lived in Iowa...but I'm not sure I'd have time for that.  Maybe the first year could be a scouting year....I guess.  I'd have a tough time convincing my wife of that though! LOL  I'll check out that website and see where I it takes me.  Thank you!
