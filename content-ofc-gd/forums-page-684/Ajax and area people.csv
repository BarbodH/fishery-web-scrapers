466294,fish-miester,2010-05-14 02:00:00,864,all i can think of off the top of my head would be frenchmans bay in pickering or hayden shores in whitby
466296,skeeter,2010-05-14 02:02:00,1907,yes to fishmeisters suggestion and duffins creek if you want to try for rainbows and suckers.
466298,Twocoda,2010-05-14 02:03:00,4130," thanks fish meister...ill do a googe earth thing and see what i can find ....on these spots...im not taking the boat down there ,,,,just going to bring the long rods and pin for a few hours...probably with little sucess as the water levels must be high with all this rain ...or should i bring spinning gear for chucking hardware ?"

466355,GoneFishin,2010-05-14 04:14:00,349,I would try frenchmansbay. There probably won't be any trout in duffins  and there's lots of cat fish carp and pike in frenchmans. Either way good luck.
466371,young_one,2010-05-14 05:32:00,620, MY SPOTS! How's the rainbow count GBW?
