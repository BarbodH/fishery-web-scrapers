466517,doubleheader,2010-05-14 17:04:00,497,"Lew, possibly a bear, although it would have to be a pretty constipated one. Most of the bear scat around our neck of the woods looks like a pie filling with berries and such. As for black bears not eating fawns, a rather exhaustive study in PA showed the #1 predator of fawns was black bears not coyotes, and while black bears generally eat berries, nuts and the like, they are very opportunistic and definitely will prey on fawns."

466551,shane,2010-05-14 18:45:00,652,"I remember one time, out in B.C. on the north part of Vancouver Island, my girlfriend and I were hiking down a dried up creek bed and we heard some crashing in the bush about fifty feet behind us. We turned to look just in time to see a big, full grown deer jump out of the bush and take off full speed up the creek bed away from us. Then, there is more crashing noise, and this big black bear jumps out of the bush and stopped on the creek bed and looked at the deer running away on him.  I'm sure that this bear was chasing that deer. The scarey part was when the bear saw that the deer was getting away, he turned his head and saw us standing there and then took a few steps towards us.  Like he was going to come after us instead.  But then he stopped and stood up on his back legs and had a good look at us for a few seconds and then finally turned and disappeared into the bushes. I almost left my own 'sample' right there."

466161,ChrisK,2010-05-13 21:17:00,2772, More than likely bear dung...As for the deer poop bucks dung looks more like a solid pile and the doe dung looks like larger size pellets so if thats a buck its gonna be a big one and seeing that you have a good population of deer there it wouldn't suprise me if you have a big buck or two hanging around in the area...  Cheers !
466162,Paully,2010-05-13 21:25:00,712,  I've seen nuggets like that in the rouge valley in north scarborough.. unless there is a population of bears living in the rouge i'd say its a large buck.  http://books.google.ca/books?id=k4oLmXx80jIC&pg=PA15&lpg=PA15&dq=buck+scat&source=bl&ots=ki5SCXz38t&sig=Py35CBNc33KTkB-i48t_9NI1FtA&hl=en&ei=T27sS8DQKIOKlwf4rei0CA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CBQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=buck%20scat&f=false

I'm no expert on animal poop but I'm still going with a bear just from the shape and size of the droppings, which are actually much larger than they appear in my original picture.  Someone mentioned possibly a dog but I've owned dogs my entire life, including a very big St. Bernard and nothing compares to this. I've never seen a coyote big enuff for it either, but I spose it could be a large wolf but to be honest I don't even know if we have wolves around here....15 miles north of Peterboro. I've been hanging around these parts for more than 50 years and have never seen a wolf. I did hear alot of howling after sunset last night, which isn't uncommon,  but I'm pretty sure it was a bunch of coyotes.  Anyways, it makes for an interesting discussion, thanks for everyones opinions."

Some with cubs. One ate a bar of English Lether soap we had outside. So it is entirely possible they are in your area. That said, I'm sure I've seen spring deer scat like that.  They are on grass right now and don't form the pellets well. Kinda mushy. Cut it open. If you find hair it is likely a bear."

It's definitely a bear's...  but if you want to make sure.... jab at it with a branch and see if there's any fur or fruits in the middle....  Bears are mainly carnivores and will eat just about anything.... they will kill and eat fawns (4 - 5 each year), that is why the does, when giving birth, will eat the amionic (spelling here??) sack and lick it's offspring until dry and cannot omit any smell.  And also why the fawns have spots so to camouflage themselves with it's environment.... they are pretty hard to see.  I know you have lots of deers around cause of the pics you posted in the past when you moved to your new house.  Having them around and bears, I'm sure the old grumpy is scouting for some fresh food.... fawns are his target and trust me they have a pretty acute sense of smell.  If I was you, I'd keep my garbage cans under locks too. Hope this make sense and helps you out. Leechman"
466088,JohnF,2010-05-13 19:26:00,3494,Did you check it to see if it tastes like bear food or what? That's how the serious trackers do it.  JF
466091,Big Cliff,2010-05-13 19:34:00,6899,"Male bear 400 lbs +/- a bit. (a sow will have her cub(s) with her and wouldn't likely come that close unless she was really hungry and she will be looking for high protien right now because of the cubs. She wouldn't bother with bird seed) and has been enjoying bird seed either from your place or somewhere close by.  Stop feeding the birds (there is enough natural food for them now anyway) and do not leave any food scraps around even in a garbage can or in your garage.  They usually won't bother a person unless they are startled or cornered, they will choose to run away if given the chance. If you do encounter one, do not run from it, stand and face it, just like a dog, they will chase after you if you run away because to them you are just game trying to escape! If you stand and face ityou pose a threat to them, they will escape if they can.   I have hunted bears for nearly fourty years, been between a sow and her cubs on many many occasions and never once have I been attacked. They have always chosen to leave even to the point of leaving their cubs behind."

There scavangers so they will eat meat but don't hunt it, they survive mostly on plants, berries and dead stuff. In Ontario we have Black Bears not grizzlys for the most part there pretty lame, docille, shy creatures unless provoked and get use to garbage and man, then they can become a problem."

465944,Guest gbfisher,2010-05-13 14:13:00,0, Reminds me of that Eddie Murphy joke about the Rabbit and the Bear. The rabbit is sitting having a dump and along comes a bear who sits rather close to the rabbit and he too starts havin a dump. The rabbit gets kinda scared when the bear asks him. Do you have a problem with Scat sticking to your fur? The rabbit reply's Why no I don't thinking to himself how lucky he is. So the bear wipes himself with the rabbit.
