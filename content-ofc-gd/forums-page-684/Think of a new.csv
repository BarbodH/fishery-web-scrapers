466736,Dave Bailey,2010-05-15 14:15:00,1641,"C'mon guys, quit ripping the HST, the government is actually being very magnanimous here. It's being foisted on us by a provincial liberal government because they were being heavily pressured to do so by a federal conservative government. So now instead of just grumbling about one level/party we get four gripes for the price of one, a super-bargain any way you look at it!"
466057,rylan,2010-05-13 18:28:00,134,"It is time for real change, not empty promises. No amount of socialism or free market ideology will save us from ourselves, there needs to be a fundamental re-write of what we think we know, to achieve a sustainable human enterprise.  Our generation has stood and watched as our planet has been raped and pillaged, yet we do nothing. Our generation has stood and watched as our government bailed out the very people who created this economic crisis, yet we do nothing. Our generation has stood and watched as our rights have been stripped away from us, and yet we do nothing. Our generation has stood and watched as we have been handed the problems of the countless generations before it, and we are preparing to do the same to the next generation, and we do nothing.  Let us be the first generation to hand solutions to our children and our children’s children. But we can’t do it alone. Let us break down the barriers we have created amongst ourselves. We need all of you, every last one, to say enough is enough in one voice. Not as Americans or Russians, Christians or Muslims, but as fathers, mothers, brothers and sisters. Let us destroy the lines between us and work to create a world where our children are truly safe and free. Let us create a world where we can tell our children that they can be and do whatever their heart desires, and know deep inside us we are telling them the truth. Let our generation be the one."

466060,cuzza,2010-05-13 18:36:00,467,You can copy and paste a Zeitgeist press release. What's your point?
466063,Twocoda,2010-05-13 18:45:00,4130,I dont see mention of Canadians causing any of the problems related to the world but reference to Americans and Russians in your post...  As far as religion goes....learn to read the lines in what ever book it is you read be it the Koran or the Bible( instead of interpreting between the lines)....i dont see mention of terrorism or after hour choir boy practice....  Problem solved free of charge...  Im going to hit the back button now and see if i entered a political/religion forum by accident...  Carry the weight of the world and you WILL be crushed  Cheers

466075,Big Cliff,2010-05-13 19:11:00,6899,"As long as the politicians can line their own pockets at our expense and they are seldom held accountable for their actions (doesn't matter what country you live in) you and I can't do anything about it except suck it up. Fuel tax, GST, PST, HST, income tax, property tax, tax on smokes, booze, food, health, personal care products, a cup of coffee, a bottle of water, marrage, funerals, stop smoking aids, you name it, they tax it, you and I pay for it. When the casinos and lotteries were established the money generated was to go to keeping our taxes down and helping to repay our deficite. Today they rake in billions of dollars most of which goes into the rich pensions and wages of the people that are supposed to be here to serve us!  Before you can fix the world why don't you start with something reasonable like fixing Canada!"

466138,Big Cliff,2010-05-13 20:30:00,6899,"HH, the one thing I learned a long time ago is ""the better they tell me it is going to be FOR ME"", the better I know it is going to be for THEM!  You have to ask yourself why a government that claims they are against smoking, it costs our health care system millions of $ a year, sees fit to tax non smoking aids. Oh wait, I forgot, billions of $ in taxes on tobacco products could be lost! Why does a bottle of rye cost $55.00 here in Canada but $15.00 in the US, they tell us it is to ""encourage"" social drinking, Bull! The rate of alcohol abuse in the US is actually less than it is here in Canada (not by much mind you).  I could go on, and on, and on but we are Canadians, we trust everyone even after they have lied to us (good old Mr. Chretien ""I put it right here in the red book me"") (Shelia Copps ""if the GST isn't removed, I'll resign""; well she did after there was a public outcry.)Oh, and a fixed byelection! (Jag Beduria, gets elected on forged doccuments but still gets to serve (as a back bencher mind you) but he should have gone to jail, no pay, no pension, no $200.00 for passing go, he was still allowed to serve as a member of parliment)  If there was a revolution that might accomplish a change, I would be part of it tomorrow. Saddly, my kids will probably be saying the same thing long after I am gone."

Remember --- The governments of the world WORK for the people--- not the other way around.   Big Cliff---- do you work for the government?  because everyone that I know dose not like where our tax money goes,( like you said in the pockets of the rich ) and we are all pissed off enough to at least START something-- sure nothing may result but I for one is sick and tired of bit-ching about it."

466187,Big Cliff,2010-05-13 21:55:00,6899," As a matter of fact I do as does everyone on this board even if we don't get the fancy pensions and big pay cheques. Do I get any kind of a pay cheque from any Government agency? Not  penny that I haven't already paid into, i.e. CPP."

466196,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-05-13 22:01:00,0,"Do not pay attention to that man behind the curtain(The OP) I am the great and powerful wizard of o errrr. Government.  We lie to you, rob you , you get angry for a bit, we use distraction tactics and fear to focus your attention away from the thievery, we feed your bad habits to keep you in line, and have your head spinning with lies from the media to manipulate your every thought.  Now go back to your lives of servitude to us and fish and enjoy the scraps we give you, and all will be alright(for the rich).  Carry on.  Apply(lies), rinse(make up more lies, to cover the first lies that were discovered and to distract), clean(make you forget why you were mad), repeat(start all over again).  There seriously needs to be more accountability in government. Both Liberal and Conservatives.  Apparently Electricity is going up 20% this year AND I've noticed that my friend was paying 5% tax on certain services and now is paying 14% thanks to the HST. If your a business owner? The HST is gold lining for your pockets.  http://www.citytv.com/toronto/citynews/news/local/article/76365--electricity-rates-to-rise-20-per-cent-this-year"

It is coming to reality very quickly that we could be on the verge of a GLOBAL revolution."
466234,Terry,2010-05-13 23:37:00,14456,people revolt when times are tough when there is no hope in sight  when you have nothing to lose  where anything is better then what is happening around you  that does not describe Canada
