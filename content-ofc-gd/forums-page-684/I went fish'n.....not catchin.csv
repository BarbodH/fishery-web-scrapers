466243,lew,2010-05-13 23:53:00,12766,"I don't do alot of fishing before musky season opens, 'cept for a bit of pickeral and this year I've been busy around the new place, so haven't even gotten out for them yet, so I decided today would be the day to get the boat wet and look for some fish.  I put the boat in at Youngs Point and decided to go for a long fast ride first. I cranked it up and averaged around 50 - 52 MPH for the next hour and just really enjoyed being on the water again. I ran the length of Clear Lake then basically covered most of Stoney too just taking in the sights.    I ended up over at Burliegh Falls and did some fishing around the fast water, but nothing was happening there.    I ran back down into Clear and trolled around for a couple hours but nothing was doing except for one largemouth. I was marking a ton of fish all through the water column and the weeds were really healthy and plentiful.  The water was clear and between 55 & 57 degrees F      Anyways, not much of a fishing report but it sure was nice to be out on the water again."
466247,Carp,2010-05-14 00:15:00,1488,Nothing wrong with a nice cruise on the water and taking in the sights. Getting fish is a bonus.  Good luck on the water this season Lew.  cheers !!!!
466259,pikehunter,2010-05-14 00:34:00,1659,"Opps! Good post Lew, I meant to reply to your   other thread...got this one. Nice pic of the salad BTW."
466301,Squid,2010-05-14 02:12:00,1656,Temps are looking good and so are those weeds!!
466315,leechunbao,2010-05-14 02:43:00,23,nice weed

466440,John,2010-05-14 13:17:00,2956,Sounds like a great day on the water Lew. Nice looking salad for this time of year.
466473,bigbuck,2010-05-14 15:00:00,2449,"Lew, you averaged 50-52 for your cruise?? You speed demon you!! I guess the boat is running ticketdy boo. Did JP's speed run get you going?? I'm the slow one of the bunch, I can top out at 48-49mph, not that I've been able to. The boat has been on my driveway since the 1st and it hit the water that day for a 10 minute shakedown in the rain and that was it."
466478,lew,2010-05-14 15:17:00,12766,"I normally cruise at about 30 MPH Bruce, but every now & then it's good to blow the cobwebs out"
466479,walleyejigger,2010-05-14 15:17:00,876,"at least you got a nice salad for ur dinner,"
466480,Joey,2010-05-14 15:17:00,9122,"Well it looks like a nice day out there fish or not.  Yes, that cabbage is looking nice and healthy.  A nice place to have a few fish hiding behind shortly I'll bet.  Joey"
466490,fishnsled,2010-05-14 15:40:00,3520,Looks like a great day on the water to me.   Always nice to know the boat is running fine.  
466496,bigbuck,2010-05-14 16:08:00,2449,"Ok Lew, I was kinda wondering about that. It is good to give it a good workout once in a while to clean out any carbon accumulation in the chambers."
466521,corvette1,2010-05-14 17:12:00,1765,with all those hooks no fish looks like the lowrance was demo mode its ok lew they were small fish i guess you have to wait till june for the big girls
466527,bigbuck,2010-05-14 17:31:00,2449,I think Lew was just out fishing for some bait for when Musky season opens.......
466532,basketclam,2010-05-14 17:52:00,115,"Lew, I can almost see my cottage in that first picture there.  Just a little farther around the point.  As with you, I didn't see many fish this weekend, aside from the panfish."
466552,mbosh1980,2010-05-14 18:45:00,349,If you had panned 90 deg left in that first picture I could have seen my in-laws.
466555,lew,2010-05-14 18:57:00,12766," Yup, that's it, the Lowrance was on the wrong setting...at least that's what I'll use for an excuse !!  basketclam & Bosh, sounds like maybe we should plan a Clear Lake g2g seeing as were all close together.  Bosh, if your In-Laws are 90 degrees left of that pic, they could be my neighbors as that's exactly where I live too."
466561,mbosh1980,2010-05-14 19:12:00,349,"I'm up all next week, though I think raking leaves and powerwashing decks might be higher on the to do list than fishing.  If I see a boat tearing by at 51.2mph I'll wave"
