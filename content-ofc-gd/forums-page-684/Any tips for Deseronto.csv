466488,jimmer,2010-05-14 15:38:00,2730,Will be making my first trip to BOQ in the Deseronto area at the end of May.  Any specific colours or bait suggestions would be appreciated.  Will target walleye and pike. Thanks in advance!
466523,Hooked,2010-05-14 17:20:00,891,"  Pretty much the only lures I use this time of year there are husky jerks, tail-dancers and minnow raps.  They always work.  Black/chrome, hot chub tail-dancer and firetiger have always done well for me.  Good luck."
466694,pigless,2010-05-15 05:25:00,22,Worm harnesses with bottom bouncers right around Foresters Island also seems to work well this time of year
466765,Sinker,2010-05-15 16:52:00,8692,I'll second the worm harnesses.
466768,Mike the Pike,2010-05-15 16:58:00,3421,Perhaps I will see you out there I will be there May 28th.29 and 30th.  Worm harneses and suspending rapalas.Go to the napanee river.  MTP
467145,jimmer,2010-05-17 13:09:00,2730,Thanks for the tips guys.  Look for a 14' Black Smokercraft with a 25 yamaha and two ugly guys in it.
467212,Fish Farmer,2010-05-17 15:38:00,2234,"First, avoid weekends and opening if possible. When I used to fish the Telegraph Narrows, Big Bay and Foresters, I just Drifted with a #2 or 3 silver Mepps and worm near bottom. If you can't get a good Drift, crack the Elec. 1 notch"
