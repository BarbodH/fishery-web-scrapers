449802,fishhunter,2010-03-30 11:14:00,604,15th is yours. see you guys all soon. any questions pm me
449830,e-z-out,2010-03-30 13:05:00,1052,   I still remember that day that was a close call lol It would have hurt like hell if that hook had gone in any deeper
450032,radar,2010-03-30 21:02:00,138,15th is perfect
466847,fishhunter,2010-05-15 23:53:00,604,I would love to thanks the 3 guys that showed up but not pleased with the forth that did not show up. A call or email would have been nice. I would never expect that from an OFC guy but I guess I was wrong. The other guys wanted to cover your cost because they felt bad but I told them no way. I think that is very low what you pulled.Other people wanted that spot.  Just my rant.
467039,ctdd2006,2010-05-17 00:34:00,531,That sucks!  Too bad.   Glad you guys made the best of it and good on you Lloyd for eating the loss(although you shouldn't ever have to!).....good things to follow!  Cheers.
448514,e-z-out,2010-03-26 21:39:00,1052,Hey guys got myself a great deal on a BOQ walleye charter from Fishhunter just wanted to find another 3 guys to split the cost.  If anyone is interested just send me a pm. Price $125.00 per person  When the hooks-ups are back up could one of the MOD's move this post thank you.
448516,Billy Bob,2010-03-26 21:45:00,5865,"More info would help....what are the dates and what kind of fishing are we talking about....jigging, drifting, trolling, etc......  Bob"
448521,Roy,2010-03-26 21:53:00,13728," Excellent deal at any time of the year. You shouldn't have a problem filling the slots, Jose. I'd also need to know the dates.  I don't think the hook up section will be going back up....it's to be discussed."
448522,e-z-out,2010-03-26 21:57:00,1052,  Thank you Roy From what Lloyd told me any time from May 8th all the way till june I'm good for any date i can book it off.

449611,e-z-out,2010-03-29 22:47:00,1052,  Solo all seats have been taken up.  Saying that i can always twist Lloyds rubber arm and set another charter up for another 4 guys at the same price.
