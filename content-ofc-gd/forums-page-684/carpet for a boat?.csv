465950,Keenan,2010-05-13 14:40:00,59,"im redoing my boat, putting new wood floor and carpet in. Does anyone know of a good place to get carpet around lindsay? thanks"
465951,bushart,2010-05-13 14:41:00,2628,Consider that no slip marine vinyl---no more vacuum
465955,Keenan,2010-05-13 14:44:00,59,where can i pick up some of that?
465958,bushart,2010-05-13 14:53:00,2628,That I wish I had an answer for---all's I know is I would like it in mine.  Carpeting is ok if your waterski-ing---fishing---gets bloody---sandy--worm guts---fish scent eats some--hides small hooks--  Vinyl--get a hose  I'm sure someone will let you know where to buy
465962,aniceguy,2010-05-13 14:56:00,1094,Lowes home depot or Rona all have marine carpet as a rule if they don't have it in stock they can order it. I believe I spent 100or so yrs back re doin a boat
465963,scugpg,2010-05-13 15:01:00,1373,I'd be looking at vinyl if I did it again.
465968,mr blizzard,2010-05-13 15:07:00,1589,I agree. Get marine vinyl no slip. Try talking to an upholster who works with boats. I put in carpet 5 years ago. Stands up great but you end up doing a lot of shampooing after a couple of fishing trips.
466184,spooner_jr,2010-05-13 21:52:00,193,You can order it through Cabela's or Bass pro.
466189,irishfield,2010-05-13 21:57:00,26272,Home Hardware sells a nice vinyl for doing outdoor decks that would be perfect in the boat. I love my vinyl floor and my snap out carpet. I leave the carpet in most of the summer.. but when the nasty weather starts it comes out.
