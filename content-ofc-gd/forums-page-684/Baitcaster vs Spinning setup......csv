466525,cuzza,2010-05-14 17:27:00,467,"We all love buying new fishing gear and the more I watch WFN, the more I want to try a baitcasting setup. I have used spinning/fixed spool reels for a long time (most of that in the UK where baitcasting reels are the preserve of sea anglers) and can do pretty much everything I need to at the moment.  So, what are the advantages of a baitcaster over spinning gear? All my fishing is done from the bank (no friends with a boat ) targetting bass and panfish mostly although I'd like to give piking a go at some point and I have fly gear for chasing trout and the like in rivers.  I don't subscribe to the school of buying cheap gear to start out as I believe it's false economy, so I don't want to spend a good chunk of cash to find the experience and results are the same.  Any help or experiences would be appreciated, Thanks, Richard"
466531,bassman87,2010-05-14 17:52:00,586,you like tossing bodybaits? better to do it with a baitcaster
466549,cuzza,2010-05-14 18:44:00,467,"I do, but nothing big though. Googling around suggests that baitcasting gear gets more range with bigger baits and accuracy is improved with practice."
466631,Musky or Specks,2010-05-14 23:48:00,2710,Bait-casters are all about the heavy line. Line that doesn't sit well or cast well from a spinning reel. For Mono thats anything above 10 lb test. I'll use up to 25Lb braid on a spinning reel. Anything above those lb test I use a bait-caster. Its hard to find a good spinning rod that will handle heavy lines(15-100 lb) and lures(2-6 oz) so if you want to fish in the garbage or toss big baits a bait-caster is almost a requirement.
466692,pigless,2010-05-15 05:14:00,22,"I'll also add that if you fish for really long periods of time, a baitcasting setup is easier on your wrists. I find after fishing 7-8 hours with a spinning rod, my wrists get sore but it doesn't happen with casting gear."
466697,ChrisK,2010-05-15 10:06:00,2772,If your going to use the pole for lighter applications a spinning set up of some kind would suite you better. I would go with a medium action combo. Just keep in  mind that baitcasters have come a long way and there are some real sweet light action combo's available that can chuck smaller baits if your interested ??  Cheers !!
466710,BillM,2010-05-15 12:23:00,17367,Medium action Shimano Clarus or Compre along with a Shimano Citica would be a great setup to start out with....
466767,smally21,2010-05-15 16:57:00,993,"baitcaster have way more power, and faster retreival speed as well as good points already mentioned.  plus the pros use them."
466809,cuzza,2010-05-15 20:59:00,467,"Thanks guys - seems like its something I need to look into, I'll head out and try some setups in my hands.   That sounds good - I'm a bit of a Shimano fan as it is"
466924,OhioFisherman,2010-05-16 10:48:00,6623,"I learned on casting tackle back in the 50`s, it is nice knowing how to use both and be comfortable with them? Spinning tackle is generally better at casting light weight lures, 1/16 - 1/8th ounce.  A casting reel doesn`t have to be used with heavy line, I have older Shimano`s that have never seen anything but 10# test mono, just reels that I was real comfortable using in open water situations. Learn to flip and pitch."
