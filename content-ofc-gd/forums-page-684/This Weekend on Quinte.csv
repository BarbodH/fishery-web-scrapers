Late start to the day, didn't hit the water until 11:30 and were off the water at 15:00. We ended up catching 21, kept 11 and threw back 10 under 12"". All were good eaters with the biggest being 17"". We got them on bottom bouncers and keel sinkers with spinners. Picture below from Saturday displaying our catch.  Sunday was the debut of the Fat Guys Fishing Team in the Quinte Walleye Open. Me (Just Fat) Bob (Fatman) and Jack (Fatboy) pulled out of Perfect Vue at 5:15 headed for Deseronto. Boat was launched and we were waiting for blast off by 6:15. 7:00 hits, past the dock to check the livewell and make sure all equipment was in order and off we went. We fished all over BOQ and at 12:15 when we stopped for a short bathroom break we only had 1 fish in the livewell...uh oh!! Fished a couple more spots and ended up in the reach for the last 1.5 hours. Managed to boat 10 fish in the last 1.5 hours and weighed in a small bag. Nothing big but felt good to weigh in 3 fish as many teams didn't have any fish or 1 or 2.  Had a great time out on the water and met some great guys. Had a good talk with Sheldon Hatch and Gord Schultz, admired their 21 foot Tracker Tundra for a while and headed to the awards ceremonies. Just as we walk up the Fatman's name is called and he went home with a $100 prize pack. It was a great tournament and Kevin we are definitely in for next year! "
