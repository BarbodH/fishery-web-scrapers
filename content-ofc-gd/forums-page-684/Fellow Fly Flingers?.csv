464830,streamerstripper,2010-05-10 13:10:00,28,"Hey guys, moving out to the Hamilton area soon and I was just wondering if there are many fly guys on here?"
464848,rock34,2010-05-10 14:05:00,215,"Im a fellow fly slinger.... I think there are a bunch of us on here, but it doesnt seem to get a lot of discussion on these boards."
464849,fish_finder,2010-05-10 14:06:00,370,I too decorate trees with feathers and fur!
464850,mbac31,2010-05-10 14:06:00,904,Me to. Since 4 years old. Still get out some
464852,cuzza,2010-05-10 14:12:00,467,"Fellow fluff chucker here - there's a fly fishing club in Hamilton, last meeting of the season is tonight though"
464859,shane,2010-05-10 14:34:00,652,"For the last couple years I've been trying some fly-fishing. Though I always bring my spinning gear with me as well.  So, when I get tired of not catching any thing, I can go back to the spinning rod."
464861,torco,2010-05-10 14:40:00,656,"I am a Fly fishing newbie. This will be my first full season, of course I still use my spinning gear but my goal is to use the fly gear once a week starting June for the rest of the season."
464871,FlyGuy5,2010-05-10 15:53:00,101,I've been fly fishing and tying for 15 year now!!!
464917,The JAY,2010-05-10 18:42:00,239,I'm going to go get me a cheap rig just to train the muscles for it. Probably only use it in the yard until I learn to gracefully hook tree branches.... Then I'll spend some money on making myself look dumb....
466949,streamerstripper,2010-05-16 14:19:00,28,"great!  Looks like there are alot of fly-guys on here.  Question for all of you - I've been looking around and to be honest, it doesn't seem like there is much in the way of a fly-fishing specific forum for ontario, do you guys think there would be much interest in such a site?"
466954,Spiel,2010-05-16 14:40:00,9065,"I used to be quite rabid for fly fishing but as of late I've been less than active. I hope to get back into it in a big way someday, soon.  You might want to have a look around here, I used to participate some years ago.  http://flyfishingforums.hipwader.com/"
