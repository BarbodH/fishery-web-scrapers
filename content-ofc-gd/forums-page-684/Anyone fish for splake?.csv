466068,anders,2010-05-13 18:57:00,1168,"yeah...fish them like you are fishing for specks and look for them in the same areas as you would with specks....small spinners, worm and slipshot, little spoons such as little cleos, and even a slip bobber set up.  This all works well...they are little piggies..."
466143,walleyejigger,2010-05-13 20:36:00,876,"they're skiddish, troll (paddle) if you can by canoe in super stealth mode, super slowly with small spinners n live bait, thats how we doos it"
466144,mbac31,2010-05-13 20:39:00,904,"I will be up there chasing them this wekend for opener in Zone 15 as well. I fish for them the same as I do for Brookies. Stelth approach is the key and long distance casting also. Small spinners, little crankbaits and smaller jigs work best for me.  Good luck and happy opener."
466153,irishfield,2010-05-13 21:07:00,26272,.. them spoons you sold yesterday would work great!! lol
466199,AzuluSpookd,2010-05-13 22:05:00,348,Thanks for the help guys....much appreciated.  Those spoons were larger Salmon and Trout spoons wayne...no small ones in there...but I've got some in my other box
466387,singingdog,2010-05-14 10:32:00,1047,"Lots of splake fishing here. Like folks said, think like a speck and you should be good. My magic lure is size 7 countdown Rapala in Brook trout pattern.  One other thing: look for warmer water. A few days ago, I fished a lake really hard for several hours with a few half-hearted hits. I found a bay where the water was a few degrees warmer and the brookies were hitting as aggressivly as smallmouth, chasing down lures from 20' away in bright sunshine. I have experienced the same thing with splake. A couple of degrees is all it takes."
466489,addy79,2010-05-14 15:38:00,573,how deep will you typically find them??  I rented a cottage next weekend and they have splake n rainbows. Wouldnt mind giving it a try as well....
466721,singingdog,2010-05-15 12:55:00,1047,"Depends on water temps. On tuesday, both brookies and lakers were in 3-10' of water, with temps in the 58-60 degree range. Brookies will stay shallow right up to mid 60's."
