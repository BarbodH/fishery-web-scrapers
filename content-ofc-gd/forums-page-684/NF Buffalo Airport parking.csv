466686,John Bacon,2010-05-15 04:20:00,3277,Does anybody know a good place for parking near Buffalo airport?  I would be looking for something along the lines for park'n'fly where I can leave the car for a week at a reasonable cost.
466688,irishfield,2010-05-15 04:23:00,26272,Park right at the airport.. cheaper than Park-n-fly self park lot at Dixon/Carlingview!  http://www.buffaloairport.com/Parking.asp?sec=0#Realtime
466693,Gerry,2010-05-15 05:22:00,257,"Long term parking lot B is $50 US a week, I think......they raised the prices a bit as of April 1st. They have shuttles to take you to the terminal. Easy and as convenient as using the Park N Go (or whatever they are called now) across the street."

466732,irishfield,2010-05-15 13:58:00,26272, That goes on your T4 as a taxable benefit.. correct?
466735,fishing n autograph,2010-05-15 14:14:00,2540, Sure...same with the coffee and donuts hahaha
466751,smally21,2010-05-15 16:22:00,993,i fly early out of buffalo and stay the night before at any one of the cheap hotels across the road.  each has a shuttle and will let you park for two weeks with one noght stay. it is actually cheaper to stay and park than to park and fly.

466853,sirfish,2010-05-16 00:40:00,175,You can book your parking online. Thats the only way I go . Never a hassle. Just google parking at buffalo airport and pick one. Also search for parking at buffalo airport promo codes .you might save another $5
