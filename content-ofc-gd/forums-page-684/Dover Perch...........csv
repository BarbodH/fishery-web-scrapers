467073,SRT8 smoker craft,2010-05-17 02:47:00,1107,It was like that all over only a few being caught in the inner bay today and nothing in the outer bay the weather this week should get them moving in. That cold snap and wind storm made a mess of erie. There was tonnes of smelt out at bluffs dead and alive swimming around in big schools I think I will stick to burwell till bass opens.
