So I'm looking to get a new smoker (I have 2 for free if anyone wants one, one wood burning one electric/hot plate unit that I made) and I just found this Landmann Smokey Mountain 2-Drawer Propane Smoker in the BPS flyer.  Has anyone ever seen this and or used it?  There is only one review on the site so before I drive an hour or more I figured I would ask here.  I've got $300.00 I'm willing to spend on a new smoker.  Thanks.  link to smoker on BPS site  Geoff"
