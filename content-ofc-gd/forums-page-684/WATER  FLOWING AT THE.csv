466533,T Fisher,2010-05-14 17:53:00,139,Can anyone tell me if the flow of water at the dam in Lindsay is flowing or have they shut it down again?
466557,jimmer,2010-05-14 19:05:00,2730,"Just went and checked it out for you.  It looks closed; however, the water is high (upper and lower) and spilling over the dam and the concrete side.  The water is very stained.  See lots of carp surfacing. It is definitely higher than when the walleye were in there spawning."

466731,Jer,2010-05-15 13:53:00,1426,"The Tri-lakes are very high right now as well. I believe they are still doing some work on some locks downstream and are holding the water back in the larger lakes. Last time I looked, Lower Buckhorn was very low.  The level on Scugog will give you a good idea of the flow in Lindsay. If the water is rising, the dam is closed, there will be little flow. If the level is dropping, the dam is open and the water will be flowing."
