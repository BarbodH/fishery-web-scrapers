466582,Big Cliff,2010-05-14 20:22:00,6899,"Depends on water temps. clarity, depth, light conditions, and time of day. Green weeds a good start."
466591,Garnet,2010-05-14 21:02:00,2056,"Post spawns spots are were you find the wally's. Just put your boat in the water try deep, try shallow and if that doesn'r work try in between."
466594,Sinker,2010-05-14 21:11:00,8692,You can't go wrong in green weeds. Find the deeper edges and work them slow.  S.
466645,buckster,2010-05-15 00:09:00,530,I think that all depends on the lake... Personally in the kawarthas this time of year i catch most of my fish between 8-12 fow.  Like mentioned above green weeds!
