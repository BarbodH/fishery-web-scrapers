I spoke to one of the facilitator and she said ice still at the bay.  Any other fishable area? We can aim for trout, carp or pike, flexible. I am not looking for anyone's specific honey hole. Just first time fishing huntsville.  I am not sure if the lake is still frozen, We are also just fishing on shore.  Hopefully trout will laready be open on the river system"

Lake trout is open right now, and the big lakes are free of ice....pretend you're at the whirlpool and chuck those spoons    Closer to Huntsville you also have Mary and Vernon lakes with Lakers in them...not sure what kind of shore access you can get there....but it could be worth a shot."
574726,reelinrolly,2011-04-21 00:00:00,281,I wouldn't just limit yourself to shore fishing..... I am sure there are tones of places that rent canoes in the area....fairly inexpensive and it allows you to move around........that is if the ice is gone...lol
