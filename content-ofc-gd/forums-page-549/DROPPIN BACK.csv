574634,canadian_copper,2011-04-20 20:00:00,925,RAINED PRETTY HEAVY ALL NIGHT AND JUST TOOK A DRIVE DOWN TO THE CREEK TO SEE THE DAMAGE. TO MY SURPRISE IT WAS DIRTY BUT STILL VERY FISHABLE. SO RACED HOME AND GRABBED THE GEAR. WAS STILL SPITTIN MOST OF MORN SO THAT KEPT ALL AWAY. HAD THE CREEK TO MYSELF( A VERY RARE OCCASION THESE DAYS). LOADS OF FISH MOVIN AROUND. CAUGHT ALOT OF FISH TODAY AND VERY HAPPY TO SAY ONLY 2 WERENT DROPBACKS. VERY POWERFUL AND DROPPIN BACK DOWN TO THE LAKE VERY FAST IN THIS HIGH WATER. GLAD TO SEE BIG RAINS COMIN SAT SO THAT WILL PUSH MANY MORE DOWN  AND OUT AS OPENING DAY SLAUGHTER STARTS. GOOD SIGN OF A SPAWN

574850,Harrison,2011-04-21 14:02:00,2202,Saw the same thing Bud.  Great year for the fish.  Blew in and blown out.  Lucky devils.
