574933,kuhaman,2011-04-21 17:56:00,503,"Lots rivers fowin into lake Huron should be full of trout, and anglers.Season opens saturday. Good luck"
574934,Twocoda,2011-04-21 17:57:00,4130,  i would say trout might be a good species to target...  Good Luck on your adventures this weekend..
574941,GreenCanada,2011-04-21 18:16:00,375," I saw a 16-20"" trout in the Speed River a couple years ago right near the quarry, around opening day. Maybe sit tight and see if you can find that one, no sense going out of town  Maybe try the Grand River at the Shand Dam, it might be busy, but should be decent fishing...  Tight lines and clear skies!"
