574977,chilli,2011-04-21 20:22:00,199,That's awesome We did the classroom hatchery in Stevensville for the last two years but they died both times. The kids were upset but gained an even greater respect for the environment. They're more determined than ever to keep our streams clean. This year the school is trying a third time but have the tank in the hall instead of the class. This way the whole school gets to watch.
