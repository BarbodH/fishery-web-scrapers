Well we do this time and it's tonight so I hope to see a bunch of you there. The last two shows have been crazy & with your support we can pack the house again tonight and have a great show. So please help spread the word about it to all your fishing buddy's and come on out tonight it's going to be a blast.  It's FREE Doors open at 630 show starts at 7 Georgian Theater 1 Georgian Drive Barrie ON  Hope to see you all there!"

574538,Bob Devine,2011-04-20 16:10:00,251,"Entertaining and educational for the packed house in London last night. For those who have not seen it I am sure you will have a good time. Dave it is a good thing Bev(security) did not have her walker or she would have chased you down.. LOL  For those going to the ""show"" tonight and Thursday please support ""Casting for a Cure"" and pick up a Shimano hat, it is a very worthy cause."
