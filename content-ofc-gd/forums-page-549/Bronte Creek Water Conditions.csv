574509,Fang,2011-04-20 15:08:00,1330,It is a mess for sure. I'm about 10 minutes down the road and even our little creek was roaring all night long. Went out to pick worms and it was too cold for them to be out. What a difference from last year but that's fishing! I was taking Monday off to extend my weekend and do some quiter stream fishing but looks like I'll delay that day off till Thurs/Fri next week
