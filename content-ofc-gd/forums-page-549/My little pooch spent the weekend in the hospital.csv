We seldom see the bills our doctors are sending in to the Gov, but you can bet they are high. My wife and i have been doing IVF, and the cost of that, not including the Meds, is over 18,000.This year it is covered by medicare, but not the first time we tried. With Vet bills, they seem high because we have to pay cash from our pockets, so we see the cost right away.Plus, they recieve no subsidies from the Gov for new equipment or training.  Paul  "

I have never seen a vet bill more than a few hundred dollars. Went to Vet1 with our beagle for a sore leg we thought may have been broken, the vet said gonn need xrays, pills blah blah, initial upfront of 1.5k . went to vet 2 said if its bad just tell me how much to put him down. They looked him over for 50 bucks, said he was fine."

The bill came in at $1400 and I never even blinked when it came time to write the cheque and I'd have gladly payed twice that much to be sure he's healthy, happy and pain free.

574707,Teressa,2011-04-20 23:13:00,55,"We too have been lucky with our vet. Our middle dog Brandy , a miniature poodle, had this huge lump (larger than a baseball) coming out the side of her neck when she was almost a year old. 1 over night stay, surgery and meds +  free follow up visits cost us just under $500.  Our oldest dog Angel, a toy poodle/bichon, was attacked by a standard poodle (we had origionally rescued her from an abusive home -  and after the 2nd attack was put down) when she was 12 years old. Not once but twice. Needed surgery, over night stays, meds...the vet actually lost count of the amount of stitches both inside her neck and out, again free check-ups afterwards, again under $500.  Our guy loves our babies almost as much as we do. I cant count the number of times we have gone in to see him and he says ""No charge today"". He is the only vet I will ever take my dogs to. Now Angel is turning 15, Brandy 5 and Cosmo is turning 1. We are actually seeing him next week for the rabies shots."

574760,smally21,2011-04-21 02:05:00,993,"i have a friend with a vet clinic, always busting her chops about the bills. she raised an interesting point. an overnight hospital stay for a human patient with some doctors care, a few tests and an xray is likely to run up a bill of around 10000, maybe even 2-3 times that (sick, but true). we've all heard the story of the broken leg on the US hockey trip with the 40000 bill from the american hospital.  so she points out that the dog hospital uses all of the same equipment, follows the same procedures, and is staffed by doctors with similar (read expensive and long) educations. and the bill is say 1200 and everyone freaks out.  not sure how valid the argument is but it did give me something to chew on.  hope for speedy recovery!"

574781,bigugli,2011-04-21 03:32:00,6138,"The point was made a couple of times, but has been overlooked?  In an Emergency vet clinic you will have 3-4 staff on hand at all times. That is the Vets fees plus $600 per shift to pay out in wages, let alone the medical supply  costs. There are all the other costs as well. Against that you have a number of pets in house for treatment. Some vets are more reasonable than others, but the Emerg clinic is a business without ties, or loyalties, to clientele. It exists to provide a service for a profit. No different than a private hospital or clinic for people."
574981,BillsTheBassMan,2011-04-21 20:37:00,932,"As a lifelong lab owner I've got to tell you that big vet bills are not uncommon.  My last lab required a $2500 surgery at the age of 2 (granted that was accident related).  What I find is common among labs are the consistent ear infections and symptoms from growing too big or too fast.  As far as eating stuff goes, I once saw one of my labs pass a piece of tinfoil with an entire chicken breast and bone in it.  He got into the neighbours garbage and the rest is history.  Best dogs ever but they have their share of issues health-wise.  Thankfully, since their so friendly, people will go out of their way to help them out.  When my last fella got cancer he was enrolled for free treatment in a program at the University of Guelph (the best vet school in the country).  Initially it was said he only had three months left at 10 1/2 and he lived to 14 due to that program.  Best of luck and get the pet insurance next time.  With most labs you'll make your money back in the first two years on ear infections alone."
574513,motion,2011-04-20 15:21:00,403,"As you can tell from my avatar and from some of my previous posts, I have a 7-1/2 month old chocolate lab named Toby. Last week he started vomiting daily. It got to the point that I ended up at an emergency clinic.  Any of you who have been through this, you will understand that initially cost is not an issue. When they told me that he may need surgery, I had knots in my stomach. Knowing labs, they are notorious for eating anything and everything.  Well, after a very expensive barium test (including x-rays, they found no blockage). i was relieved to hear this. I really didn't want my little having to go through major surgery. He ended up having to be put on an IV and they also found an ear infection. Other than that, he was OK. We think it may be something he is eating when he's out in the yard playing.  Well, almost $2000.00 later, he seems to be on the road to recovery. I now know why I should have taken out pet insurance!   Any of you had the same experience at an emergency clinic?  Cheers."
574519,Governator,2011-04-20 15:39:00,879,"I have experienced this exact thing and my heart goes out to you.  My dog had extreme allergies and had 4 or 5 episodes over a 3 year span of vomiting, shivering, diarrhea (with blood in her vomit & poop).  She had a lot of issues and our vet bills were through the roof.  She would do 2-3 overnights at the vets with $1500-$2000 bills each time (this is on top of her hypoallergy food & pills she was on to control itchyness).  Eventually though her allergies had just overtaken her where she'd naw herself till she bled and was a living a very unhappy life.  Thus we put her down last fall.  Of course every dog is different and it could very well be that your dog happened to eat something out of the garbage and just didn't settle well in their stomach.  It happens, unless this becomes a regular occurrence you shouldn't worry too much about it just keep a close eye on her.  When they are young they don't know better and get in to everything often without you knowing.  If the vet bills though become such a worry for you, you should really consider pet insurance.  I'm not sure if you can still qualify for that but its worth a shot - I wish I took it when I had the option."

It's costly, but I wouldn't think twice if I found myself in their shoes.   On a bit of a different note, I hate how some vets hugely inflate the cost of their treatments based on demand.  Every year, we wait off buying heartworm pills and other annual treatments in Toronto because it is half the price in Sundridge (and many other rural vets).  Even considering the gas both ways (we just wait until we open the cottage), you are still saving 150+.  It bugs me how a vet can look you in the eye, say ""your beloved animal needs this"" and charge an insane markup.  I understand every clinic has their own expenses to stay a float, but when does greed become a factor.  </rant>"

I called the breeder and told her what was happening. She got me into the Vet where her dogs and pups all go, Allandale in Barrie. They did a quick Xray could see no blockage an did a barium swallow. The result was that my dod had Ferinjitis (a soar thoat). I was given a liquid medicine for her and walked out with a bill under $300.

I would hold her in my arms, and talk gently to her until she came to.We spent thousands trying to find a cure.The vets had never seen a case like it, where i could predict the day and hour she would sieze. Finally, we had to put her down, not because of the money, but to relieve her suffering and to regain some peace of mind in my familly.Its a terrifying thing to watch a big dog in the holds of a grand mall seizure.The Vets do what they can though, with no funding for research.

The vet there was the absolute best vet that I have ever been to. He does vet duty to most of the local dog teams. He examined my dog, did blood tests and xrays all after hours. He also provided special food and meds and gave him some shots all for a pretty reasonable price (about $500). Pup was back to his old self the following day.  It cost more for me to go into the emergency room for diagnosis and meds for a bad flu bug there last fall (luckily 80% was covered by insurance    )"

Years back we took our Lucky into a clinic after hours. She had gotten into the tin foil chocolates on the tree and was sick. We were charged $450 per 6 hour shift she was there. We took her out the very next morning due to the excessive cost and were threatened with being reported to the humane society for ""failing to provide adequate care"".

574665,Big Cliff,2011-04-20 20:47:00,6899,"A few years ago we had a cat that had to be put down, she was very old and very sick. One of the Vets here in Lindsay wanted me to pay them $48.00 to do a physical on the cat before they would put her down and then the cost of putting her down and If I wouldn't let them do and charge me for the physical, they wouldn't put her down. That was the last time I ever went to that vet. We found another one that took one look at the cat and agreed that it was time. Been going to that one ever since. You have to believe that when a vet crys as much as you do when she has to give your dog that final needle she has the pets best intrest in her heart.  Here is something that I think sums it all up very nicly:   JUST A DOG  From time to time, people tell me, ""lighten up, it's just a dog,"" or ""that's a lot of money for just a dog.""  They don't understand the distance travelled, the time spent, or the costs involved for ""just a dog.""  Some of my proudest moments have come about with ""just a dog.""  Many hours have passed and my only company was ""just a dog,"" but I did not once feel slighted.  Some of my saddest moments have been brought about by ""just a dog,"" and in those days of darkness, the gentle touch of ""just a dog"" gave me comfort and reason to overcome the day.  If you, too, think it's ""just a dog,"" then you probably understand phrases like ""just a friend,"" ""just a sunrise,"" or ""just a promise.""  ""Just a dog"" brings into my life the very essence of friendship, trust, and pure unbridled joy. ""Just a dog"" brings out the compassion and patience that make me a better person. Because of ""just a dog"" I will rise early, take long walks and look longingly to the future.  So for me and folks like me, it's not ""just a dog"" but an embodiment of all the hopes and dreams of the future, the fond memories of the past, and the pure joy of the moment.  ""Just a dog"" brings out what's good in me and diverts my thoughts away from myself and the worries of the day.  I hope that someday they can understand that its' not ""just a dog"" but the thing that gives me humanity and keeps me from being ""just a man"" or ""just a woman.""  So the next time you hear the phrase ""just a dog,"" just smile, because they ""just don't understand.""  ~Unknown Author~"
