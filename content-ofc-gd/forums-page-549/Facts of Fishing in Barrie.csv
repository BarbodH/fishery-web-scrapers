Some tips and some laughs.  I left the rest of them at the bar.     Paul Powis   J.P.   Dave   Part way through the minnow bucket story   This young guy was hanging on Dave's every word during the tail... sorry tale.    Conclusion     Thanks Guys."
574798,NAW,2011-04-21 09:35:00,4022,"Thanks for posting the pics Rob.  It was nice meeting you last night.  I saw you snapping some pics of the crowd, and I was sure I had some retarded looking expressions on my face in some of them.  Funny thing last night.  JP asked the crowd if anyone ever goes out on Simcoe and always expects to catch a fish, every time (speaking about Bass specifically).  Not expecting anyone to raise their hand.  And iN a very subtle way, Cudz raises his hand just a little.."
574799,Bernie,2011-04-21 10:03:00,3190,"Looks like it would have been a great time. I'd like to take in a seminar by Dave someday. I bet he puts on a good show. One thing about Dave, there's lots of room for advertising on his shirt."
574800,Roy,2011-04-21 10:06:00,13728,"Really nice pics, Rob. That's the difference between someone who points and shoots and someone who thinks about the shot. I'm sure that Dave would like a few shots of the young lad ""hanging off his every word"". A great publicity shot and I'm sure, a good story to be found in there.  Thanks again."
574826,kickingfrog,2011-04-21 13:01:00,8333," That's why I didn't post the ones of the crowd  No, in all seriousness the one crowd shot I tried to load onto photobucket wouldn't upload last night. I'll try this morning.  Edit: Just added a crowd shot to the original post. Looks like you were right N.A.W."
574839,NAW,2011-04-21 13:40:00,4022, Haha..  I'm the only one looking at the Camera.  Nice looking Camera by the way.. Are you a profesional photographer?  I look like a deer caught in the headlights!  Good stuff..
574840,addy79,2011-04-21 13:44:00,573,What venue was the show at?? Looks like my old High School auditorium at Barrie Central.
574849,kickingfrog,2011-04-21 14:02:00,8333," No, I'm just a poser.   No it was the theatre at Georgian college. I went to Central as well."
574863,addy79,2011-04-21 14:37:00,573," Nice! lotta good times at Central! Went there from '93-'95. probably spent more time at the pool hall across the street than in class  Played rugby for Mr. Andrews two games and quit LOL something about getting my face trampled on with steel cleats didnt do it for me, i'll stick to hockey...safer"
574867,TJQ,2011-04-21 14:54:00,7806,hahahaha... I couldn't help it!!  
574869,GBW,2011-04-21 14:57:00,8460,LOL @ TJ!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
575035,Cudz,2011-04-21 22:45:00,2652,"Lol.  I did raise my hand.  Tentatively but I did raise my hand. I was actually thinking whether or not I have been out on Simcoe for smallies and been skunked.  I think I have but it was night time and even still I totally expected fish. Good show. Nice to finally meet Ryan, Brandon and BillM (Who, incidently lives 1 block away from me)."
575237,brandon,2011-04-22 17:15:00,857,Nice shots Rob!  It was great meeting you and Chris!
