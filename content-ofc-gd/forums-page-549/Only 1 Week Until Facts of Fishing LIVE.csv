574245,Live2fish85,2011-04-19 21:12:00,1633,I will be at 1 or 2 of these forsure Dave's one of my favourite fisherman to watch and I like how if you email him he returns the email personaly. His laugh is awesome too nothing like that laugh to make you want to get out on the water.  Chris
574365,coreyhkh,2011-04-20 01:41:00,163,"Man Dave called me out because I was not cheering mostly because I was under the weather, it was kinda embarrassing, but I forgive him"
574376,kickingfrog,2011-04-20 02:05:00,8333,"Barrie tomorrow night, don't forget to bring a non-perishable  food item for the food bank."
574470,Dave Mercer,2011-04-20 13:01:00,148, I was not that hard on you. It could have been worse you could have been Bev the security person lol. I hope your feeling better

574716,coreyhkh,2011-04-20 23:31:00,163,"The guy that wanted free stuff was funny, next show I will crap right up front and be the loudest one  Everyone though seemed to have a good time.On another note its great that Dave is so in touch with his fans and gives back so much, its refreshing even if he gives you a hard time."

571822,cranks bait,2011-04-13 13:24:00,721,Why does all the fun stuff have to be so far away?????  I can't even get a Dave bobble head to feel like I'm part of the fun.
571843,limeyangler,2011-04-13 14:29:00,5204,  LOL...Dryden aint in the running either.

572071,Cudz,2011-04-14 03:59:00,2652,How about the west wing near my house?  Ardaugh/Ferndale.  Actually there are other places much closer to the college. There is one place by Eastwiew I think it is called Roosters that has huge wings.
573405,The Urban Fisherman,2011-04-17 22:30:00,2050,Aye boys and girls!  I'm packin' my bags as I type this!!! It's as close as I'll ever get to traveling the road like a rockstar! haha I can't wait to see a bunch of OFC'ers out there at Facts of Fishing LIVE!  It's gonna be one heck a way to kick off easter weekend with the family!  Please don't hesitate to say hi to me! I love meeting OFNER's... even if it looks like I'm workin... the boss is a pretty easy going guy! haha   :thumbsup_anim:  Cudz - wings and such for sure - we'll figure it out as a group.... I'll have to pack some gear up and help out with some things so I'll likely be a little later showing up but I can't wait to kick it!  See you soon!  Ryan
573432,scugpg,2011-04-17 23:46:00,1373,London should be a good show had fun there last year!
573444,BillM,2011-04-18 00:09:00,17367," Dude, we are practically neighbours if that West Wings is near your place.. It's about a block from me  I'm sure the guys would rather something in the north end though closer to the college.  Isn't there a place off of Duckworth? (First road on the right past the college?)  I swear there was a bar/grill or something like that down there."
573471,Cudz,2011-04-18 00:53:00,2652,I live 2 blocks from there bill. lol. I will find out for sure but there is one beside eastview which is just down grove.  Also Lockeroom near st.vincent and cundles beside the big cop shop st. joes area.  That is very close.
573576,brandon,2011-04-18 15:11:00,857,I'll be at the Sarnia and London shows taking some photos for Dave.  Feel free to say hi!
