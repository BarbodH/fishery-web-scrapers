The bite is definitely heating up, the water is up to 6C, and we managed to land a bunch of perch in our hour out there, with 6 of those being healthy keepers over 10"".  We were hanging out in about 30' of water using worm bits on a drop shot setup.  The young lad caught his biggest Perch yet a fat 11"" female and was suitably grossed out by the eggs spilling out  I had picked up a light Daiwa rod and real at BPS over the winter and spooled it with 4# flouro and I have to say it is absolutely the perfect setup for these little panfish.  I was super impressed with how sensitive that setup is.  Anyways, we have some nice little fillets just begging for a frying pan."
