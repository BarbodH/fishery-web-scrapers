574349,Twocoda,2011-04-20 01:02:00,4130,excellent!!!!! Photography too...love the first pic...
574352,Live2fish85,2011-04-20 01:10:00,1633,Very Nice fish and I agree with Twocoda that first picture is amazing you should send that into Canada Outdoors or one of the fishing magazines I'm sure they would love to publish it and it would be neat to have your own fish and photograph published.
574479,l2p,2011-04-20 13:42:00,346,"you guys are too kind, the camera did all the hard work! i just had to catch the fish and take the shots haha"
574489,ctranter,2011-04-20 14:15:00,543,awesome fish and great shots
574490,kemper,2011-04-20 14:15:00,2232,"Hey, I recognize those fish...  Nice shots bud, I still think there are 2 missing from that bunch"
574506,craigdritchie,2011-04-20 15:05:00,1586,"Pretty fishes, and very nice shots."
574756,l2p,2011-04-21 01:52:00,346,"thanks, your blog has some awsome old school pics!"
574769,rock34,2011-04-21 02:34:00,215,wow man.  Beautiful. Thanks for sharing.
574844,highdrifter,2011-04-21 13:52:00,2534,OOOHH!!  The first pic is mint.  Well done!!
574852,Leecher,2011-04-21 14:04:00,7832,Great report and excellent pics l2p Thanks for sharing!!! Leechman
574854,manitoubass2,2011-04-21 14:09:00,11391,"Great pics, even better fish! I'm jealous, don't get to fish those very often myself.  Just a quick question, why do fly fisherman almost always have the reel in the pic??? Is it sort of bragging rights to catch on a fly instead of a spinning reel or baitcaster?"
574861,fish_finder,2011-04-21 14:26:00,370,"Some nice feesh you got there bud!  Great photos, and some interesting variation from fish to fish.    Firstly, why not?  Secondly, i don't believe those to be fly reels"
574868,manitoubass2,2011-04-21 14:56:00,11391," I'm not hating on it, it makes for some nice pics. Just curious as to why it's used so frequently"
574876,fish_finder,2011-04-21 15:15:00,370,"I guess it just gives a little more depth to the photo having some gear in the shot.  Those are centrepins though manitou, not fly reels.  Pinners and Flyers both like to show off their gear me thinks"
574877,manitoubass2,2011-04-21 15:20:00,11391," I see, my bad. I've obviously never used them so I'm not even sure of the difference, lol.  Again, not hating, they're gorgeous pics for sure. Makes me wanna learn a little more about my camera, haha"
574880,Twocoda,2011-04-21 15:24:00,4130,mostly to reference the size of the fish...
574881,manitoubass2,2011-04-21 15:32:00,11391," Ahh, I see. Makes sense"
574882,l2p,2011-04-21 15:38:00,346,"Thanks guys, I dont think it has anything to do with boasting at all haha for as long as i can remember ive always seen fish close ups along with gear, maybe to show what you used to tame the ""beast"" like kill shots with bows and guns."
