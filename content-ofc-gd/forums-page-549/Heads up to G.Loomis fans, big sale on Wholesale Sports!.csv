They got GLX, GL2/3 and Walleye spinning and casting rods on sale for STUPID CHEAP. I may buy a few, just because they're too good to turn down   .  If anyones looking for a GLX for around 50%+ off...check it out!!!!  Mainly UL's but theres quite a few normal sizes in the mix too. Besides, havent you always wanted to treat yourself to a 5' IMX UL for whitefish"
574514,Bondar,2011-04-20 15:27:00,817,I dont see a sale ? is there a link for it  
574515,solopaddler,2011-04-20 15:32:00,8605, I didn't have any problems finding it.
574517,ctranter,2011-04-20 15:36:00,543,I think this is what he's referring to:  Spinning Rods:  http://ca.wholesalesports.com/storefront/g.loomis/home/fishing/fresh-saltwater-fishing/spinning-rods/c0-c20-c201-c20102-b100330-p1.html  Casting Rods:  http://ca.wholesalesports.com/storefront/g.loomis/home/fishing/fresh-saltwater-fishing/casting-rods/c0-c20-c201-c20101-b100330-p1.html  It's always nice not having to deal with customs too.
574518,archie_james_c,2011-04-20 15:39:00,618,You got it Ctranter. Also if you guys look under the normal loomis rods and just scroll through their different sizes/actions they have some hidden ones in there on sale too
574524,Bondar,2011-04-20 15:44:00,817,Thanks !
574537,ADB,2011-04-20 16:09:00,444,This thread is not nice!

574566,Bondar,2011-04-20 17:11:00,817," this one  Trout & Panfish Spinning - 2 Pcs., 4-10, 7' ?"
574568,Live2fish85,2011-04-20 17:21:00,1633,No I was actually looking at the 1pc 6'6 turd Crankbait baitcast for $159.99 regularly $269.99.

574625,lookinforwalleye,2011-04-20 19:48:00,4399, It`s easier to ask forgiveness than permission!!!
574656,archie_james_c,2011-04-20 20:31:00,618,  You throw turds when your fishing?
574768,Live2fish85,2011-04-21 02:33:00,1633,"Yea that's true asking for forgivness is easier lol, but I'll save that for something that cost a bit more lol. Like a new boat lol. And as for the turd, I have no clue what I was thinking when I wrote that I am assuming that I was calling my daughter a turd and wrote it not thinking but who knows lol."
574995,lookinforwalleye,2011-04-21 21:00:00,4399,"I was wondering about the turd as well, I thought it was a new fangled bass lure!"
