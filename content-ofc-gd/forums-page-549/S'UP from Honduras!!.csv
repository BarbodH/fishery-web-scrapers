574730,highdrifter,2011-04-21 00:09:00,2534, Nah they were pipe dreams..  Reality has set in for me too.  It's mizerable here right now.
574788,TDunn,2011-04-21 04:58:00,680,Solid fish man! Great shots of them too.  Almost time to bust out your leaders on some pike!   TDunn
574862,Leecher,2011-04-21 14:31:00,7832,Nice going Fidel   Congrats on your first
572132,highdrifter,2011-04-14 13:44:00,2534,"Hey gang,  Just stopping in to say hello..  Been a fantastic week so far.  I'm seriously thinking of taking an extended leave of absence, who knows, I might just stay..  The Island life and flats fishing is da bomb!!  Simply put, it's paradise here.  Soo, here's a shot taken with my guide's cell phone (my camera got dunked lol)  I've been out twice hunting these fish and I must say that it is the most challenging type of angling ..  From spotting fish, to laying a perfect cast to line management, it's the epitamy of fly fishing.  My first permit!!    cheers HD"
572134,Joey,2011-04-14 13:53:00,9122,"Looks like Paradise Fidel.  Enjoy yourself hon, but please, make sure you come back  Joey"
572139,laszlo,2011-04-14 14:15:00,487,Oh Snap!
572143,perchslayer666,2011-04-14 14:27:00,280,Why you wearing a ladies scarf? Is it cold there?
572145,kickingfrog,2011-04-14 14:30:00,8333,Can you see what finger I'm holding up?
572146,mercman,2011-04-14 14:35:00,7054,Very nice Fidel ! Enjoy your time away my friend   Paul  
572147,highdrifter,2011-04-14 14:36:00,2534, Nice one.  Mommy tell you to put that up?!?!
572259,solopaddler,2011-04-14 20:02:00,8605,"Oh wow, you're one lucky dude!  Have fun and enjoy yourself bud."
572261,Rattletrap2,2011-04-14 20:10:00,1652,"I was in Isle of  Roatan a month or so ago. Amazing place, but didn't do any fishing. Saw tons of them including a Permit while snorkelling the reefs there. It is definitely a place I would like to go back to."
572264,DRIFTER_016,2011-04-14 20:22:00,10439, I have a buddy that lives in Roatan that stayed with me last month. Might have to get him to return the favour sometime.
572268,wallacio,2011-04-14 20:39:00,475,Very nice Fidel!   Keep the updates rolling!
572281,Slop,2011-04-14 21:44:00,151,Very nice dood!....looks like alot of fun.
572428,Bondar,2011-04-15 06:34:00,817,"So awsome ,  I would give up every fresh water fish to be able to fish the salt all the time !  i'm jealous Congrats on the 1st permit"
572448,The Urban Fisherman,2011-04-15 11:10:00,2050,C'mon brother you'll miss freezing your finger tips off chasing late and early season chromers to much!  Have fun bro.... Keep in touch!
572629,highdrifter,2011-04-15 18:15:00,2534, Tones of permit on the west side..  My guide and new best brah's name is Greg Baldwin..  He's from Colorado and has worked in Alaska for fish and game..  Could it be?!?!
574144,strakey,2011-04-19 17:02:00,78,Wow buddy you have just accomplished a very rare feat. You are now a master. All you have left is to catch a grandslam of bill fish. IMPRESSIVE
574229,ehg,2011-04-19 20:27:00,2666,Nice going Fidel
574306,highdrifter,2011-04-19 23:36:00,2534, We had awesome snorkeling just a short swim away from our boat.  Good to see that the reefs were still in prime condition..  Need to get certified and do a real dive next time.  cheers!
574308,highdrifter,2011-04-19 23:41:00,2534, Hahah thanks dude.  3 days on the flats for that one fish..  We must have spotted over 60 on the last day..  We had a whole school cruise by the boat on both sides and not even a sniff..  I pulled my fly from a taker and that was the closest I ever got to a second fish.  My guide almost socked me with his flats pole Hahah!!
574311,highdrifter,2011-04-19 23:45:00,2534," Naaahhh..  Well, I did miss the ditch a little..  We'll be in touch sir!"
574312,highdrifter,2011-04-19 23:55:00,2534,Here's one more shot and a close-up of the head..  Crazy forked talk and dorsal shaped like a scythe.  And huge eyes for spotting prey and predators.  A marvel of evolution.  3 fish charged for this rutter cutter and this one got to it first..  She absolutely crushed it!!      Hopefully I'll have some video and more pics soon.
574330,MJL,2011-04-20 00:29:00,2427,"Incredible catch Fidel  If I didn't just blow a ton of cash on some new camera gear, a trip to Honduras or Guatemala was next on the list"
574647,msp,2011-04-20 20:15:00,1336,Nice fish. Did the shirt and the scarf come with the fly rod ?
574721,Twocoda,2011-04-20 23:43:00,4130,its snowing here right now   if i was you i would take the extended leave of absence without a thought..  Nice fish and i hope that isnt your lucky scarf now  I hate being jealous  Cheers
574729,highdrifter,2011-04-21 00:08:00,2534, Yep!  They're part of the flats combo HAHAH!!
