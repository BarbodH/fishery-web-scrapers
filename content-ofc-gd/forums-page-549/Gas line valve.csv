574971,GBW,2011-04-21 20:06:00,8460,like this Al? Brass 3 Way Fuel Selector Valve
574976,Pikeslayer,2011-04-21 20:19:00,1443,Why not take it to the next level and put in a marine fuel filter??? Then no need for 3 way.  Slayer.
574984,walleyejack,2011-04-21 20:41:00,358,"yes, along that line, i guess any automotive store or ctc would have something."
574986,walleyejack,2011-04-21 20:42:00,358," there is a fuel filter installed,i was looking,there is another outlet on it,but would I not need a valve to shut off one of the lines ?"
575004,Pikeslayer,2011-04-21 21:37:00,1443,"WJ, I run both the 115 & 9.9 of the filter without any valves. Just make sure you are connecting to the output vs. input.  Slayer."
575009,walleyejack,2011-04-21 21:43:00,358,"ok, sounds simple, i ll look again, but i know there is 1 inlet and two outlets,will double check. I was reading on some other sites,about when one engine is running it sucks the fuel line dry on the other one and things of that nature.  thanks pike"
