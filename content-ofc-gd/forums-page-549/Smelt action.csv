574433,Rod Caster,2011-04-20 05:33:00,5784,"Nipfisher, Joeytier, Jim jigger and I hit the river tonight and we caught the beginning of the run. In total I think we netted 50 or 60 smelt. This will pick up over the next week I imagine. The best thing about the run so far is the size of the smelt we are catching!! biggest one approached 9inches and the average was around 6-7 inches! I like the high meat to cleaning effort ratio.  One thing to note: the lucky strike nets that Canadian Tire sell are complete crap. Why haven't they come out with a better product??? If someone could make a composite (like the hockey sticks) net, they would be a hero in my mind. I'd gladly pay $50 for a net that will last 5 years versus three disposable nets every year at 19.99 each.  Had fun tonight boys, we'll have to do it again.      "
574459,marrex_mike,2011-04-20 12:15:00,40,nice catch!! I havent seen smelts like that in years! there huge
574468,Nipfisher,2011-04-20 12:55:00,2449,I cleaned over 40 last night. I'm guessing you had about 30 making our # close to 70. Biggest one I had was around 8 inches. I kept a few biggies to salt and freeze for the big pike.    My lucky strike net held up but my folding Rapala net now requires a new handle. Good times.  Here is a picture I took this morning. On pack is frozen and the other will be consumed today.  
574565,LucG,2011-04-20 17:11:00,779,"Looks like yous have a successful outing!  I've never gone smelt fishing, is 70 a good number?"
574571,Nipfisher,2011-04-20 17:31:00,2449,  Luc when they run 1 guy can easilly get 70 an hour. There was 4 of us and we were at the creek for 3 hours.
574584,Dara,2011-04-20 18:04:00,3052,"So, still kinda slow eh..oh well...its all fun"
574596,Nipfisher,2011-04-20 18:31:00,2449,Here is the in-between pictures. The after shots will ake a day or 2    The 3 on the left were just cut and scooped out. The others I sliced down one side of the back bone for easier (faster) cooking.  I used Italian flavoured Fish Crisp and Salt/pepper. Mmmmmmmmmmmmmm. Washing it down with a cold beer right now.  
574598,Nipfisher,2011-04-20 18:33:00,2449, Should be good on the weekend.
574670,kickingfrog,2011-04-20 20:59:00,8333,Nipissing walleye would never eat those things.  ... But I sure would.
574735,Rod Caster,2011-04-21 00:28:00,5784," Looks good man!!! I like the butterfly cut, I'll try that next time.  My smelt are still sitting in my bucket in the fridge. Fell asleep at 2:30am  and got called out to Parry Sound at 6! ouch! Tough day, yet I'd probably go smelting tonight if I was in town. I sure hope I'm back in town for thursday night  ...the smelt are calling, will you answer the phone?"
574736,Joeytier,2011-04-21 00:30:00,3990,You'd need snowshoes to go smelting tonight
574819,Thrasher,2011-04-21 12:41:00,39,"was out, in the snow, last night, 2 of us managed a full 5 gal pail in a couple hours. There weren't running full steam, but I've scooped for a lot less! were getting some scoops as big as 40-50 in it, but they were the biggest scoops, on average about a third of that. We're not serious scoopers, more of a social, but nice to bring home some bait! Thrasher"
574841,Leecher,2011-04-21 13:45:00,7832, Sweet!!!  Those would be perfect for salties
574937,Twocoda,2011-04-21 18:08:00,4130,yummy!!!! nice scoopin guys...
