574739,Loonietoon,2011-04-21 00:37:00,1450,"Paul you hit the nail right on the head.. I have been on this board so long... can't remember when I joined, Met & fished with a lot of great people I now call my FRIENDS. We are all family here to help out when we can. Big Cliff said it best. We laugh together, we cry together, fall down and there will be many hands to help you back up. Need anything, just ask, if we can make it happen, it will be done. Hurt just one of us and you'll think you just steped on a hornets nest!  I am proud to be a member of this community, some might think of it as a fishing board but we are so much more, fishing is just a common bond.   I my self can't think of a better site to call HONEY I'M HOME"
574750,Handlebarz,2011-04-21 01:18:00,3790,Paul this is a amazing place and its the different people here that make it that way. the ones that don't belong come and go. The rest of us are here for like as unlike family we choose to be here.
574858,asdve23rveavwa,2011-04-21 14:18:00,2690,"Great thread, Paul!! I've made some darn good friends on this board, like others here, I belong to a few others as well, but, OFC is home base. I just have to stay away from the classified section  See waaaaaaaaaay too many good deals on here for fishing ""stuff""."

Oh, OK.....I have to admit Paul hit the nail on the head with this post...  Now where are all your favorite fishing spots.....I have come here daily since March of '07 lurking, hoping that each and everyone of you guys slip up and spill the beans only to find out today that you really can't even get the good beans (BUSH) up north....what the hell...."

I have met some great people who's generosity is frankly, overwhelming. I've stated this before, but, what the heck, I'll never be able to pay back what I get from this place... however it's my understanding that I can get shots for that! For those of you who have felt like something of an outsider... I can't suggest with more vigor... GO TO A GTG! You will meet some great people, some folks suffering from mental instability (those are the one's I apparently gravitate to) and many salt of the earth types. Once folks here know that you have just a slight mental inbalance, you will be welcomed and feel part of the group... In closing... if you can't hit it off with folks here, try plying them with beer... I've seen it work! HH"

574918,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-04-21 17:21:00,0,"i'm in agreement with all that has been said. i was referred to this site a few years ago and i have never looked back.  it was far more informative than the other pages, and definitely more personal and welcoming.  we have our lively debates and dreaded winternet, but i keep coming because i do feel like i get far more from this page than fishing.  when some of you have faced hardships, i only wish is that there was more that i could do.  also, i know that if i ever faced any hardships, my comrades on OFC would always be willing to lend an ear.  cheers OFC!"

It was really a fluke cause back then, Google didn't exist...and the search engine I had was called ummm I don't remember. What I searched for at the time was ""Ontario Fisting""...misspelled it unfortunately and landed here. The QWERTY keyboard layout is really bad folks. Anyhow...it's been a while now and I enjoy speaking to everyone."

OFC has been a breath of fresh air.  now if somone could help me figure out the splcheck option???  looking forward to meeting fellow members.

OFC has provided me with some of the highest highs ive had in my life as well as some of the lowest lows. Its been a ride, thats for sure."
574384,Skud,2011-04-20 02:29:00,739,I am not sure what year I joined the board but it was about 3 months before the first OFC gathering at Lakair. I missed that one but made it to several others in the following years. I am not much of a poster but I have logged in everyday since. The core group has evolved a few times over but the entertainment factor remains golden. Thanks for all the good laughs folks

Lots of laughs and good times, some sad times too. Just a great place to pull up a chair and visit for a while. I think we should add Terry's warning label to the main page as well.

I envy the fact that several of you have the chance to get together face to face on your get togethers. I actually met Simon(limeyangler) last weekend at the local CTC store.I recognised him & Jack from some of the excellent vids he has posted.I asked Jack if he knew he was famous.

Im not even sure what to call it Let me explain. When i read your posts about fishing and see your photos and video, i am excited for you almost as much as you are. When i read your requests for help about anything at all, i find myself racking my brain, and searching the net for answers and solutions to your questions. When you post jokes and humorous videos, i find myself laughing and sharing the humor with my wife and friends. And when your posts share with me the tragedies that you encounter in your daily lives, i cry. In recent weeks and months, some of you have lost friends and loved ones, and i have cried for you and have prayed for you. I have never met you, and maybe never will, but i feel the pain in your hearts, as if you were members of my own familly.Why is that? Its never happened to me before, so why now, on a fishing forum that i have only been a member of for 10 months. I feel that this forum, has made me a better man.It has stirred within me compassion, and empathy, that is completely new to me and i like it.I like it alot and those around me like what has happened to me too. And you are all responsible for the changes in me, that i carry with me into my daily living.   Paul"
574121,skeeter,2011-04-19 15:48:00,1907,"Thats because you are a caring guy with a big heart! With a great sense of humor, and a desire to help out other people! There is nothing wrong with a guy like that. Keep up the good work Paul! :thumbsup_anim:"
574126,Terry,2011-04-19 16:15:00,14456,"actually OFC is an addiction......  I think it's more addictive then crack and harder to quit..........  maybe they should have a warning label on the main page WARNING..OFC May be addictive to certain people, which can affect your production at work and affect you ability to sleep ...also may cause you to buy large amounts of fishing tackle, boats, electronics and AS SEEN ON TV products  OFC and it's Mods take no responsibility for the actions of it's members or the jobs they aren't doing"
574130,Nipfisher,2011-04-19 16:21:00,2449,Paul...I think it affects us all in the same way. Some to a lesser degree. I am a member on a few forums but I never seem to check them???? OFC ROCKS.

I had to go out and buy a new computer today because mine crashed 2 weeks ago and I have been off work for my heart so waited until I had the money to spare.

I wish I could fish the number of hours I spend here. I haven't joined any other boards, I don't know where people would find the time.  Sandra and I will be at our first G2G at Lakair in June.

The day I got the call from Kevin at Lakair Lodge requesting I post a thread on a friends fishing discussion board to help get things started. It was the very first post on TJ's OFC from what I remember. Since those days I've logged on almost every day....OFC went through ups and downs like any growing family and there were times I wanted to just walk away from it all but something just kept on dragging me back... Like mercman says, we laugh together when we are happy,we cry together in times of sadness and we morn along side of families and friends when we loose the ones we love so dearly here.  Although other sites are more fishing fanatical and they ridicule our wonderful OFC for being so off topic we will always have something they do not and thats the compassion to be with and help each other in the most sincerest of ways when the going gets tuff. Each and every one of you are the very fibers that makes this site what it is today and I'm proud of what we are and what we have become and while many websites come and go we continue to stand strong as a community with deep roots holding us firm in place. OFC forever......"

574321,Garry2Rs,2011-04-20 00:15:00,1425,"Back about year 2000 I stumbled upon a strange group of fishing fanatics on this board.  For the next couple of years I was an total inmate.  OFC was my home page and it was open 24/7.  Over time I became one of the core group, first asking, then answering all the (same old) questions...wink.  At some point I became bored and drifted away to help a friend with his new musky board.  When I wandered back, the cast of characters had changed.  Many of my old friends were gone or had become inactive.  However what was the same was that the core group were friends, even if they had never met.  They exchanged ideas, advise and stories and exchanged the events of their lives.  Since then the core has turned over several times.  What stays the same is that this is a true community.  It is also the fastest moving fishing board I have ever found.  On other boards, questions hang on the front page with little or no in-put, or worse a bunch of X2 posts.  On OFC, your post will be on page three by sundown if no one is interested...HAHAHA.  We are lucky to have OFC and lucky to be a part of this lively on-going forum."
