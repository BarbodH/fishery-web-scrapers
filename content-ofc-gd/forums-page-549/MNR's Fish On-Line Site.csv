Great for those looking for a new lake to try out.  http://www.web2.mnr.gov.on.ca/fish_online/fishing/fishingExplorer_en.html  Cheers."

574898,LucG,2011-04-21 16:31:00,779,That is very well made!  Allthough it shows a couple lakes that I though I was the only one who knew about them...lol  Not sure how acurate the fish listings are though...

575015,gone_fishin,2011-04-21 21:50:00,481, from what i've seen of it so far... not very...  pretty cool idea... but doesn't seem to be as accurate as it should be.
