574576,Terry,2011-04-20 17:56:00,14456,can they still ship them to canada with the compressed gas.....  just asking..not saying
574577,Gutpile,2011-04-20 17:56:00,27,I have purchased fishing and hunting stuff from Cabela's and have never had any problems.  Items are usually delivered within a week.
574581,Pikeslayer,2011-04-20 18:02:00,1443,I've only ever dealt with Cabela's Canada http://www.cabelas.ca/home/  I've never had a negative experience.  Slayer
574595,Roy,2011-04-20 18:30:00,13728,"The US Cabela's cannot ship Auto inflate vests nor re-arm kits to Canada. View ""restrictions"" for those items."
574600,Spiel,2011-04-20 18:34:00,9065," There are a number of items Cabelas can't ship to Canada, it's not their choice it's asinine laws (ie: fly tying material/animal parts and rod winding finish/epoxy)  But I do order plenty from them and have never had an issue. I always do my orders by phone and I know exactly the cost to my door when I hang up, I like that, no surprises!"
574603,skinny,2011-04-20 18:46:00,442,well the gass issue might be why I didn't see them on the canadian site also that is why I was looking at the us
574615,Cosmos,2011-04-20 19:29:00,588,"I had a big issue with Cabelas last time i placed my order. They charged me twice, after that they lost my shipment. Got my shipmet in 2 months from day I ordered it. Maybe it's just me."
574648,Dondorfish,2011-04-20 20:16:00,1000,I've ordered lots from Cabela's over the years ( thou not in the last couple of years) and have never had any issuses what so ever. The delievery was fast - and always the exact price that was quoted on the phone order.  Tracker (Don)
574657,Henricus,2011-04-20 20:32:00,118,I have had nothing but success albeit I found their shipping a little expensive.  
574678,dave524,2011-04-20 21:17:00,4508,"Even if you could get it, being from the states it might be US Coast Guard approved but not have the approval label for a Canadian pfd, if you had intended on it being classed a a legal life presever you could be out of luck."
574696,adempsey,2011-04-20 22:40:00,1498,Ordered only tackle a few times.   My shipment got lost twice and they replaced it with no questions asked both times.   I would order from them again but haven't done so in over a year or so.
574699,skinny,2011-04-20 22:43:00,442,well looks like Im back to buying a mustang I was just trying to save a few bucks so i could spend it on something else
574759,Marko,2011-04-21 02:04:00,854,First time i bought stuff from them it never showed up. They re-sent my order and then when it came here one of the reels was missing.  Called to ask what was up and they tell me the reel has been discontinued so we didn't send you one. Problem I had with that is that i was never called and notified about the reel not coming. It was supposed to be my friends bday present.
574766,reelinrolly,2011-04-21 02:32:00,281,purchased lots from cabelas....never had any issues!!
574778,rickster,2011-04-21 03:23:00,495, Don't try bringing in any rubber boot from cabelas U.S ..we have a wholesale acct with them and I tried bringing in some rubber boots a year or so back.. made in china..boots were 99 dollars...broker told me the import duty on those boots..because they were made in china....109.45 the only rubber boot they had at the time that you could bring into Canada were made by Kamik
