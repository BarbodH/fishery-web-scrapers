567300,chessy,2011-03-29 19:25:00,610," yes he is partialy correct and i am wrong. the reason they told us the river was never stalked was due to study that proved they did not survied . they do not stock rainbows in now what is called fmz17 due to the wild rainbow, i do not know how far that goes back i just asked about the rainbows in the ganaraska i know they stocked the crap out of the browns in the river but never 100 000 rainbows... i would like to pic craigs brain on the 5-2 fish limit on rainbows if it will make a difference or not.  and yes spiel is was good time talking to jim bowlby and the lomu again . the only time i see them is during the run at the fishladder ( in my 32th volenteering there )"

567317,aniceguy,2011-03-29 20:16:00,1094,"Cheesy to answer the question on the reduction from 5 to 2, statistically there is virtually no change in harvest rates, Somewhere in the 3 to 8% range in overall harvest rates.  I want to caution that much of the relevent data collected By LOMU is outdated and in many cases challanged data, I think that is changing with new managment at the helm.  What this does do is spark the debate for future managment directions to all salmonids.  If we want to see what a reduction really does we only need to look at the salmon river, prior to a reduction to 1 fish the run was estimated at 6000 or so with the reduction to 1 fish the fall catch was estimated at 32000.  2 fish to be blunt mearly puts a bandaid on it, but what it does is recognize that the MNR feels that harvest is not at sustinable levels and that steps need to be taken, remember the mNR doesnt have capacity to under go the neccessary work in many cases, hence where we are these days with some fisheries.  CRAA creel data from both the boat launch and tag returns show 90% are harvested in the lake and to have a sustainable fishery harvest needs to be in the 30 to 35% This entire thing has sparked us at CRAA to gather all relevent temporal data on steelhead and become an internet deposit for it when things like this pop up, right now the vast majority of supporting science sits with 3 people and we intend to bring it to a public depository on the site soon."
567342,canadadude,2011-03-29 21:41:00,769,"I would like to add the that a 1 fish limit in New York State is only for tributary caught fish. The New York State Lake Ontario limit is 3 Rainbows, if Ontario adopts a 2 fish limit we'll be less. The LOMU right now is understanding that lowering the lake limit will have a very small impact on the fishery.Personally I tried to understand there way of thinking, but the way these guys interpert data makes your head spin.The LOMU only beleives data that is convient for there decisions should be used even if other jurisdictions have success in management of the lake.One of the biggest hurdles in the management of Lake Ontario is the LOMU,the monies spent and data collection , interpertation and such is amazing and yet we never get any answers or recomondations.Nothing concreate is ever achieved it's millions of dollars for"
567357,craigdritchie,2011-03-29 22:32:00,1586,"Chessy - OMNR stocked the Ganaraska River with rainbow trout very heavily throughout the 1970s, prior to and especially after the Corbett Dam fishway was completed in 1974. MNR poured in excess of 100,000 rainbow trout smolts into the river each and every year until 1979. I know this because I was there to write about it, and in fact I helped stock some of those fish. These rainbows came from domestic brood stock at the Normandale Hatchery.  With growing levels of natural reproduction, MNR stopped stocking rainbows into the Ganaraska after 1979. The runs peaked in the early 1980s, with something like 18,000 adults passing through the fishway in 1983 or 1984, I believe. Steelhead runs have declined ever since, and now hold at around 4,000 to 5,000 adults through the ladder every spring.  The main reason the run declined so abruptly is because of insane fishing pressure and too many people killing too many fish. Most go on stringers, but many thousands of smolts are also killed each year by accident, when they're hooked by people fishing for adult steelhead. Even more eggs are killed by idiots who wade through the redds. You see this every spring.  Reducing the bag limit from five fish to two fish will help. It isn't the final answer, but it definitely will help and should be encouraged by all anglers."

( walking in a redd does not hurt the eggs ) what hurts the eggs is walking upstream and depositing silt in the redd which smothers the eggs and promotes  (saprilignia)sp  this came from a bioligist in the durham region
567417,Garnet,2011-03-30 01:00:00,2056,"My memory say the peak runs were 1986.  The counter in the 80's counted leaves, sticks, garbage bags and any other crap that went threw the fish ladder.  Yes there was insane spring fishing in the later 70's and 80's not so much in the fall and nothing in winter.  I watch these river silt back after the 1981 floods and it's still the main reason for the declining #'s."

567452,chessy,2011-03-30 02:13:00,610, mmmm the counter would show them going down stream not upstream and back then we had smaller channels and a trash rack. leaves do not  conduct enough electricity to set off the counter . also we have the same counter . just bigger channels
567469,canadadude,2011-03-30 03:24:00,769,"The record numbers of fish in the early 80's were abnormial in the fact they were a combination of heavily stocked fish aswell as naturals and the caused a population explosion. The population did take a drastic drop as the population had to rely on naturals, the population is leveling out now. The Ganaraska in it's current state may only be able to produce and maintain a healthy run of 5-10 thousand returns at best."

566227,esoxansteel,2011-03-26 20:19:00,1307,"  Regarding your coment about trout and salmon been the only fish angled before spawning, what about ice fishing for walleye on the BOQ or Scugog etc, and the new ice fishing for panfish in Zone 17 which also allows the taking of fish before they as well spawn , or should those above species be C and R as well."
566241,fishhunter,2011-03-26 21:06:00,604,I had to add my 2 cents to this one. After reading alot of posts I figured I would reply to a few in no order. Well first off in August when the water gets warmer most fish move to deeper water. (blue zone). There is no way to keep one fish or another from hitting. some days you have lots of bows and a few salmon other days you have more salmon then bows. A ethical captain will fish where he wants to and how he wants to staying with in the law given to him making sure his clients are 100% happy. I think this is not a bad thing putting the limit down to two bows but you will see alot of floaters when this starts. I do not use a net when we are not keeping bows and I still get floaters from time to time and I'm Only one boat. When I get a floater I treat as a man over board drill with one person does not take his eyes off the fish untill its picked up. I will not leave a fish for gulls to pick eyes out till its dead before you start pointing the finger at charter boats ask yourself how many people fish with rainbow roe (eggs)? When charter boats get fish they dont say its a male and throw it back because it has no eggs. We dont use eggs for chum. Maybe people should look at the hole picture and ban roe fishing in lake ontario too.(I use roe for fishing but if that changes I welcome it with open arms) How many female fish do you think would live in one year then two year and so on............. I love people that are for catch and release but still use rainbow row. This means you need to kill a fish or two to use rainbow eggs for bait and if he or she fishes alot its more like 3-6 fish for a winter/spring season. My point is look at it all before you point fingers. The Lake is only so big and and can only handle so many fish do to lack of food so if you think you will get it back to the way it was in the 80's then you live with blinders on. Its a good thing when we try and fix something but look at all the problems not just one or two then  to fix the problem. This is my 2cent and I'm sure Ill get them back ten fold.
566259,Ron,2011-03-26 22:06:00,1683," Perhaps a rephrase would be better. Trout and Salmonoids are the only species you can angle for while they are stageing. A river is much narrower than what Quinte is for an example.FMZ17 also set in place a size restriction to protect walleye to ensure they spawn at least once before harvest. As for pan fish, they are prolific spawners and keep in mind, the regs were recently changed to reflect this plus also to protect over harvest."
566341,rock34,2011-03-27 01:54:00,215,Awesome! This is so long overdue its incredible.
566442,chessy,2011-03-27 13:44:00,610,looks  like we are going to have to do this by ourselves as the OFAH says they are not willing to suport this proposed regulation change http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=52177

566516,fishhunter,2011-03-27 16:51:00,604,Mabye its times we stop taking steps and get right to the top all at once. The problem is no one has the brass monkeys to piss everone off at same time and fix the hole problem all at once. I have always liked the tagging system. Yes it would work but problem is we dont have enough people to look after what laws we have now. But its a system I would vote for. Catch and release on a fish that is in a river system for spawning from Jan1 till last Sat in April  would be also something I would vote for.
566578,bigugli,2011-03-27 19:22:00,6138,"To sustain such suggestions are you willing to support zone by zone, or species specific licensing like in Europe?  The average taxpayer won't fork out for it. Hoewever, if we want to up the return rates to spawning grounds, maybe we should just close those year round exeptions for trout on L Ontario. I'm not a trout angler per say, but from simple observation, there is a lot of scapegoating going on. If the damage is as bad as stated, reducing the limits is fine, but at the same time, close off all the open tribs until April opener. All I hear is ""make someone else sacrifice"", ""it's their fault"" but ""don't touch my holy grail"". Rather hypocritical from an observer's perspective."
566677,Carp,2011-03-27 23:30:00,1488,"With the exception of a trout that may be injured & won't survive (rare), I practice catch & release on L.Ontario. Anything that's good for the fishery is O.K. with me.  An idea to help the spawning fish would be extending the closed season by a week or two."
566683,Terry,2011-03-27 23:45:00,14456, that is what I see here too
566701,canadadude,2011-03-28 00:34:00,769,"On the one hand the MNR wants to cut the Limits to sustain a population, on there other hand they don't want to allow Rainbow trout to reach the spawning sites needed for a selfsustaining population. They are treated as non native speceices but recently have been upgraded to desirable, if you want to increase or sustain the fishery naturally, spawning habitat must be available and needs to be the #1 priority.Cutting limits, banning roe, closing seasons and all these other band-aid solutions won't fix the problem unless the management of the spawning sites is fixed."
566724,Richard S.,2011-03-28 01:30:00,75," The only river in regards to L. Ont that I am aware of where steelhead can't reach sutible spawning sites without help is the Credit river. Now having said that, just wait, the ladder in Norval will change everything.   Rich."

566795,Garnet,2011-03-28 11:54:00,2056,"This years is the 30th anniversary of the 100 year flood of Port Hope 1981. All the rivers were stripped of there silt. Ganny, Wilmot, Bowmanville, Oshawa ,Duffys everyone were silt free.  And that set the stage for in creditable reproduction. And the bait fish were in lake Ontario to support all these naturally reproduced fish.  So going back to the gory days of the 80's is just have a 100 year flood.  Lot's of guys go to Ohio,PA,NY and return with story's of huge catches 50 fish days all stocked fish. They look like steelhead but no thanks I will take naturals.  I will never support banning roe or fly only rivers. This is for elites,all these trout rivers are for family's and youth with to much time on there hands.  If you want to be elite just work around the important people."
566826,BillM,2011-03-28 14:04:00,17367, There are more then a few South shore Lake E tribs that have natural populations of fish   I'm assuming you've never fished down there.
566843,canadadude,2011-03-28 15:15:00,769,"Thats not exactly true, Bronte Creek has been degraded to a point it can't support healthy populations of trout. Dams built by Golf courses to create ponds have raised the water tempertures and reduced the flows so much that the spawning beds are silted over and the river has lost it's cold water.On the bright side Bronte is said to be getting a much needed restoration.  As for the Credit, I get upset when so much attention is given to this river in the way of stocking and restoration.Millions of dollars are invested in this system and yet we block the Rainbows and for that matter Salmon form reproducing.This river has the potential of being the one of, or the finest Steelhead fishery in Ontario, yet it has to be stocked and only a very few fish which have to be moved by hand ever reach the spawning sites."
566931,Garnet,2011-03-28 19:44:00,2056,You would be wrong about me not fishing south shore. And they all have the stocker's in them making the whole crowd just that much easier to catch. Fun to fish not that challenging.
566956,BillM,2011-03-28 21:04:00,17367," Of course they all have stocked fish, that wasn't my point.  My point was, is that a lot of them still have wild fish populations along with the stockers.  The Catt would be a great example."
566971,chessy,2011-03-28 22:01:00,610,The ganaraska has never been stocked with rainbows they use the ganny fo brood stalk for other rivers
567120,john from craa,2011-03-29 02:18:00,39,"Unless things have changed Bill, the Catt does not have a significant wild population.  Last time I spoke with NY's head bios they were hoping to 10-20% wild fish at best.  Sure, still some.  But that system is overrun with strays from Penn.  The Credit was 82% wild last year (09/10) and last fall about 98% wild, but most MNR stockers run in March so that percentage will drop once the lifts are complete.  But alas, we still have to transfer the steelhead by hand.  Cobourg Creek recently had a record year flood.  That can help...too bad it didn't knock out a few more dams.  Keep those comments coming to MNR.  With OFAH apparently not supporting the lower limit the more people that speak up and do support it will help!  There is plenty of science to support a two fish limit and none I have seen to support five fish (for a sustainable population).  John"
567146,craigdritchie,2011-03-29 03:00:00,1586,"That is absolute nonsense - at one time the Ganaraska was one of the most heavily stocked rivers in all of Ontario, receiving in excess of 100,000 steelhead per year. Chessy, where do you think the fish came from in the first place? You do realize that rainbows are not native to the Great Lakes, right? It was many years of stocking huge numbers of fish, plus building the fishway on Corbett Dam in the late 70s, that resulted in the steelhead population developing into what it is today."
567154,chessy,2011-03-29 03:15:00,610,@craig . i will find out . from my understanding the ganaraska river is 97% wild. and what we were told the ganny has NEVER been stocked.  and i am aware that the rainbows are not native to ontario i will find out 100% tomorrow. as i will be talking directly to the lomu about the fishway operation for the year
567281,chessy,2011-03-29 17:42:00,610,@ craig . fish were stocked in the ganaraska river in the 70 71 but studies have proved that the strain of fish they were using did not survive (old fish that needed to be hand milked)  the ganaraska is 97 % wild and no stocking has been done since 71
567282,Spiel,2011-03-29 17:48:00,9065, As a long time outdoor writer/angler I'm sure Craig is well aware of the stocking history of the Ganaraska and likely everything else Steelhead/Great Lakes related. I suspect what he was implying was for you to become more aware of the facts before you espouse it as doctrine. Applause to you for looking into it.

565181,bowshep,2011-03-23 20:37:00,378,"l think the limit reduction on trout will be great for the sport. As far as the ban of roe maybe just have a few rivers as fly only (but all fly's not just the top water).  l am not sure about the salmon, a lot of people make their living off of salmon charters and l just don't like taking food of their plates Its bad enough that they have to pay so much money just to run the boats with the price of fuel. l know that will be added to the price for the charter but it would just be a little harder to convince new clients to pay the money for a 2 hour charter because everyone is at their limit.  l also think that they should close down a river or two for a year and close different rivers every year to get them on a rotation. This l believe would allow the trout to increase in numbers naturally as well as stocking with harvested eggs from the same river. This fishing ban is in effect in 8 northern Ontario lakes for Aurora Trout which almost became extinct.  Yet the bad part of closing a river is that it will make other rivers heavily pressured. Maybe just ban the river till the eggs hatch.  There now l turned up the stove and the pot is going to boil...  Ken"

565223,Ron,2011-03-23 21:56:00,1683," Getting the limit down to 2 is a great step forward. This gives the shore anglers a similar advantage and perhaps a chance to increase the overall population back up to what should be acceptable. We will never see the populations like we did in the 80's, there have been many more fish stocked into the Great lakes and the bait fish populatoin can only sustain a certain amount as well. When was the last time you walked the shores and seen the Alwive die off after spawning like there use to be. When was the last great run of Smelt seen in any of the tribs?  In my opinion, the Trout and Salmon are the only fish which you can angle for before they get a chance to spawn. Even Pike will be closed in Lake O by the first of April. To me, I find it rather ironic that you can harvest fish before they get a chance to reproduce.  In my perfect world, the regulations would be like this:  Tagging system - 5 tags allotted with your Sport fishing license, 1 tag for conservation license.  Catch and release only from Jan 1 - 4th Sat in April.  For now, a 2 fish limit is a step in the right direction. We will have to wait and see if that will improve the population.  Cheers, Ron..."
565345,John Bacon,2011-03-24 01:42:00,3277, I support the reduction for steelhead/rainbow; but I wouldn't support a similar reduciton for Chinook.  Chinook are managed as a put and take fishery.  Most of the stocking is directly into the lake or into rivers where they do not have a chance to reproduce.  Stocking levels are set to keep the population as high as the bait fish population can sustain.  If more fish were kept than stocking levels could be increased.  I don't think think it makes much sense to prevent fishermen from harvesting Chinook.
565496,torco,2011-03-24 14:57:00,656,"I think proposed changed from 5 to 2 and 2 to 1 is a great step. I can't understand why anyone would ever need to harvest more than 1 or 2 fish. I personally love trout but maybe harvest 1 fish per year.  I think there are more complex and potentially better solutions for the long term but with them comes the need for more resources related to management and enforcement such as a tag system. If they implement such a system but do nothing to increase the number of CO's to check tags then I have a hard time believing the meat hunters/poachers would be deterred.  I would also never support C&R only as I believe it to be an important aspect of recreational fishing and by having fish safe for eating you are encouraging people to improve water quality which is a benefit to both fish, wildlife and us."

565547,wallacio,2011-03-24 17:50:00,475,"While it would seem that increasing stocking numbers would be a relatively easy fix to declining Lake O Salmonid populations, it's not that simple.   The present biology of the lake must be considered.  Today's lake is a much different plance than ""The Good Old Days"" on Lake Ontario of the late 70's through the 80's.   Back then, baitfish numbers were at an all-time high (maily Alewife) due to the fact there were virtually no top predators prior to Salmonid stocking and the lake was unnaturally productive due to vast amounts of nutrients (Phosphorus etc) entering from sewage etc.  This supported large amounts of zooplankton, which in turn fed baitfish.    Since that time due to pollution controls on wastewater treatment plants, nutrient levels and zooplankton levels have declined.   Zooplankton has been further reduced when Zebra Mussels were introduced in the early 90's.   All of this has resulted in fewer baitfish to support top predators like Rainbows and Salmon.  In response to delining baitfish levels, stocking numbers were reduced in the 90's for fear of predator demand exceeding the baitfish biomass.  In short, even if we had the ways and means of stocking unlimited numbers of Rainbow and Salmon into the lake, it simply could not support it.  Despite what some TV personalities say, the ""good old days"" are not likely to return no matter what we do.  See here for more details:  http://www.glfc.org/lakecom/loc/ecoswatch.pdf"

565575,strakey,2011-03-24 19:24:00,78,I agree with you BillM but that would mean no possession limit (which im fine with) and alot of work would have to be done on the watersheds to improve them.
565906,canadadude,2011-03-25 17:56:00,769,Lots of good points made and I am happy to see reduced Limits. One of the biggest problems in the reduction of numbers is the degradation of the spawning rivers themselves. No matter how many fish return if the  spawning sites and juvenile habitat keeps degrading the numbers will continue to drop. If we don't allow Steelhead into the headwaters to spawn and keep them out for other speceies it is unlikely the population will grow.Reducing the catch limits and perhaps putting in Catch & Release seasons all sounds good but the fish must have adequate habitat as well as access to spawning grounds if populations are to increase or sustain.

564309,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-03-22 00:55:00,1107,DO IT !!!!!!!!!  How about Erie to I am SOOOOOOOO sick of seeing the slaughter board shots with 20-25 dead steelhead This is very good news
564310,DRIFTER_016,2011-03-22 00:55:00,10439,'Bout freaking time.
564316,chessy,2011-03-22 00:58:00,610,raise the salmon to 50 per guy and 1 rainbow.
564320,timmeh,2011-03-22 01:04:00,609,Nice to hear. Is there a petition or something we can sign to support your cause?
564324,BillM,2011-03-22 01:06:00,17367,Great news Lou!!!!    I hate seeing those slaughter board pics posted up after a day out on the charter boats.
564325,ctranter,2011-03-22 01:06:00,543,This is good news to me!
564326,solopaddler,2011-03-22 01:07:00,8605,Great news. Hope they push it through.
564327,TerryC,2011-03-22 01:07:00,196,Looks like a good plan.  Hope it goes ahead.  Clarence
564333,aniceguy,2011-03-22 01:15:00,1094, Like anything if there are 10000000 that say great and 2 that say its a bad move you know what the decision will be
564335,toca,2011-03-22 01:18:00,274,Yeah Makes No Difference For Me So Far Ive Gotten 0 so go for it.
564337,aniceguy,2011-03-22 01:21:00,1094,"Bill we wanted it to go to 1 across the board, and that would have made a huge difference, but 2 was a good first step, it gives a few years to analize if its the right move or a further reduction or slot needs to be done. Bring on those Chromers"
564338,asdve23rveavwa,2011-03-22 01:24:00,2690,"It has had a positive impact on Lake Huron's steelhead fishery...I agree with Shawn, why not include Erie as well.  Does anyone really need to keep more than two 6-12 lb bows? There are still plenty of salmon in Lake O, for those that are fishing in a charter, or trolling the big water...and wish to keep more fish."
564343,wallacio,2011-03-22 01:29:00,475,"It's about time!   I'd also love to see a change in the pervasive attitude of many Lake O trollers that you might as well keep them because they won't release anyway.   Contrary to popular belief, they'll swim away just fine (even on the hottest summer days) if you pop them off the hook right away without bringing them into the boat, taking pictures etc."
564350,chessy,2011-03-22 01:36:00,610,with the new interaction guide of eating fish i doubt that people will want to eat the fish .
564351,kerr,2011-03-22 01:38:00,77,"not sure why people would want to keep them anyway, lake O fish are not the greatest tasting or healthiest eating but to each his own. I hope this moves forward though and good luck niceguy"

564394,Ron,2011-03-22 03:11:00,1683,":clapping:  This is terrific news to hear. I encourage everyone who fishes to send a reply to the above email addresses. It is nice to know what support you have when it comes to this type of discussion. Being on the advisory council for FMZ 17, we are starting discussions on cold water streams strategies. This will fall in nicely with my opinions and what I hope would be the general anglers opinions as well.  Cheers, Ron..."

564414,steelie hunter,2011-03-22 04:10:00,55," I know eh.. I was at the Ganny last fall, just for one day, and if the fish was smaller then 7 lbs, it went back, 7-15 lbs and it stayed on the bank. I guess bigger tastes better down that way lol. Was a slaughter show."
564449,icedude,2011-03-22 12:31:00,459,  you got my vote -hopefully this subject comes up for discussion@ the April 9th Lake Ontario Trout and Salmon Symposium in Port Credit   Cheers   Paul
564454,Headhunter,2011-03-22 12:49:00,5703,"Interesting to say the least... however I can't help but think that to some degree, this change will be a recipe for many floaters out in the blue water. I wonder what some of the Charter boat guys are thinking about this? HH"
564468,hoops12,2011-03-22 13:09:00,127,Great to hear!!
564501,solopaddler,2011-03-22 14:49:00,8605," Maybe, maybe not. Bottom line is the fish has way more chance of survival in the lake than in an ice chest.  Another factor, steelhead and salmon are targetted in different ways, and usually in different zones.  An ethical charter captain will leave them alone once a limit is reached."
564513,Hairpy,2011-03-22 15:22:00,73,"""An ethical charter captain will leave them alone once a limit is reached""  Unfortunatly Mike , this isn't always the case.  Joseph"
