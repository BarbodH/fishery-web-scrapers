574607,craigdritchie,2011-04-20 19:05:00,1586,"A 26 pound, 12 ounce Atlantic salmon caught in a small Michigan lake has been recognized by the IGFA as an all-tackle world record for landlocked salmon.  An Indiana angler named Tom Aufiero caught the fish last October from Torch Lake while fly fishing with a shrimp pattern. He released the fish after weighing it, and wound up having to send his scale to IGFA for verification.  You can see a photo of the fish here.  I have to admit to being a little surprised that the all-tackle world record for an Atlantic salmon is only 26 pounds. You would expect one of the Great Lakes to have coughed up a bigger fish by now. Maybe it's just a matter of time?"
574631,dannyboy,2011-04-20 19:54:00,367,Not sure if anything caught in the Great Lakes would be considered land-locked.  Dan
574674,craigdritchie,2011-04-20 21:06:00,1586,I'm not sure how IGFA would look at it either. But they're not sea-run either. Kind of a gray area?
574693,NAC,2011-04-20 22:27:00,369," I really need better vision because it doesn't look an ounce over 16lbs, to me.  No disrespect to the angler but..... Extended at arms length toward the camera. Suppose if he were 9' tall and 500lbs.  Been wrong before though, and will be again."
574758,green&orange,2011-04-21 01:56:00,31,"  Thanks for sharing.  Although at 19 miles long, I'm not sure I classify Torch Lake as ""small"" (at least by Michigan standards).  Torch also produced the Michigan state record musky in 2009.  http://www.fieldands...ught-torch-lake  Torch is incredibly clear almost like the Caribbean.  A great lake to visit if anyone is in Northwest LP Michigan.  It also produces some pig smallmouths.  Craig your blog is great and so is this website.  I haven't posted because I'm not sure if Americans are welcome and to be honest don't have a lot to contribute regarding Canadian fishing.  Thanks to all that keep my mind off work and on fishing."
574791,siwash,2011-04-21 08:43:00,683," Hmm, Atlantics, smallies, browns and skies?? that's quite a diverse an interesting fishery..."
574804,green&orange,2011-04-21 10:59:00,31," Yeah, but Torch is not really recognized as a great fishery around here.  There are a few muskies.  But not many at all.  Torch is a deep oligotrophic lake.  It is theorized that most muskies in the lake have migrated from Lake Skegemog (a eutrophic lake connected to Torch).  A lot more muskies in that lake.  The same for browns.  Not a lot of them and very few people target them, but there are a few around.  As for atlantics, pretty sure the MDNR has cut that stocking program due to budget issues.  Very unfortunate.  I would say that the smallmouths and whitefish provide the most consistant fishery in Torch.  Still a beautiful body of water.  Amazingly clear.  You almost have to see it to believe it."
574821,craigdritchie,2011-04-21 12:54:00,1586,"Thanks for the kind comment, green&orange. Hope you'll stick around ... this is a great board with a good mix of Canadian and American posters.  That Torch Lake does sound like an interesting fishery .... hmmmm."
574834,highdrifter,2011-04-21 13:28:00,2534, I would say so.  I'm not sure what kind of limiting factor the pollution would have on their growth rate though.  Nice blog dude.  Classic!!  cheers
574870,TDunn,2011-04-21 14:59:00,680,"Wow, what an atlantic! thanks for posting Craig! I have heard of torch lake and do remember the record musky that was caught there. Green and Orange thanks for the info too!   TDunn"
