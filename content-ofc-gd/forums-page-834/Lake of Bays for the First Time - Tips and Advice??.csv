I was hoping to latch on to a few lakers.  However, I would love to catch anyother species that's in season.  I've heard there's ling up there, and small white fish. (small compared to the stocked simcoe snot rockets)  I'm used to vertical jiggin' for lakers during the hard water season on Simcoe.  Any tips on how to latch onto the LOB lakers??  I have a detailed fishing map of the lake, so I have an idea of where to go, I just don't know what rig to use.  Do they like Minnows (Gulp, or live??), tubes, williams ice jigs, etc.  I'm not much of a troller.  I don't have planner boards, or and good trolling gear.  I have an Adventure fishing map of the lake, and it doesn't say anything about Pike.  Is there Pike on LOB??  Any tips or advice would be great,  F to the Is-H"

351365,Musky or Specks,2009-06-12 11:37:00,2710,Just a trolling method thats just like it sounds bare lure. Use something flashy little cleo etc
351393,rromberg,2009-06-12 13:29:00,10,rumour has it that pike have made their way into that system. Let us know if you come across any.
