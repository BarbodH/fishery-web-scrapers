351842,splashhopper,2009-06-14 11:29:00,2931,"My buddy and i intended on following some small tribs along Lake Erie from Pt Stanley all the way over to Long Point yesterday...  We fished for an hour at Pt Stanley, off the rocks, with minnows on a pickeral rig.... nothing.... notta..  So we head out and grab some more minnows, ""just in case"" from a local guy...  Real glad we did too...  drove a little while and decided to drop in and see a friend of ours for a coffee at his trailer along the way... he was dipping the net for minnows in the marina when we got there... first thing he asks,  "" you guys wanna go out for some perch"" ?   uhh... yeah  Jumped in his boat... and within 20-30 minutes we were marking fish...  my buddy and I knew we made the right decision to drop in for the coffee...  We didn't stay out too long,  but here is our first perch for us this season   When I got home,, mrs splashhopper says "" its about time you caught some REAL fish "" !  sounds like she wants me to go back out perchin with my buddy to me  Splashhopper"
