(unless it was my home team of course)  Am i a meanie because i enjoyed watching the red helmets hung low as the pens skated around their home rink with the cup held high? Yeah maybe..........but the guilt wore off quick when detroit booed the cup winners. Its expected, but it made hating the wings that much easier lol"

351643,MCTFisher9120,2009-06-13 11:06:00,3761,"The Media and Detroit fans thought they had the series once they were up 0-2 in the first two games. But many fans-myself included knew they could come through. The most important thing here is there lower line scoring that came to life and made this thing happen. Some teams want the cup and some teams deserve the cup, Pens deserved to win as they never gave up hope and fought through every period to stay alive. Detroit just plays good, didn't see to much inspiration from them but hey maybe i don't know what to look for.  All I know is that Crosby is the youngest captain to raise the Cup for his team and this is a amazing accomplishment, not to mention the maturing that this team still has to go through to become even better. Congratulations to the outstanding victory of winning the Stanley Cup! As for stats-Pittsburgh has not lost in a game 7 in the playoffs, but hey who says stats are always right.  Only been watching hockey for a couple of years now and that game has to be my most memorable.   MTBF"

It looks empty till about 12 mins left in the period haha 3 - We weren't booing the cup winner.... We were booing The person handing the cup to the winner !!!! BETTMAN ! 4 - What age is "" old "" ? 5 - Again, your right .  Overall.... VERY disappointed in the game, Couldn't believe it ! Still got to see a cup lifted I guess.... not the same feeling if Detroit would of hoisted it though.  Congrats Pens !"

351678,musky66,2009-06-13 15:13:00,273,Great game and great series. The best team won. Anyone can win a game or two- thats why it is best of seven. To all the guys previously dumping on the Pens and lauding the wings- you were wrong.

I suppose Malkin was as deserving as anyone else, but truth be told I find that a weak pick. But don't ask me who I would have picked over him? he had a huge amount of points, but a dismal 2 way performance, and if it were not for being on the powerplay you can minus16 points (7 goals 9 assists )...with a 36 over all points thats not that impressive, and niether is only having a +3 plus minus at the end of the playoffs?  Impressive show for TV, but as a coach, fan, and fly by night analyist...not desreving of the MVP. But then again, who would be better? I suppose stats wise... Crosby would be the winner by a 7 point regulation time performance margin, and a +9  plus minus puts his effectivness 6 points over Malkan. But then again if Bettman makes those calls then the media hype(he who scores most) will win every time....loved his shout out to Mario LOL!  But for last night in general...Talbot deserves a HUGE thank you from the fans, and his team mates. He worked his butt off!  Sai la vie... Pitty won fair an square, and deserve to enjoy the warmth of the spot light for a while.  Cheers,"

351611,Sebastian,2009-06-13 03:20:00,208,"Even though I'm on the same boat with Stoty by always wanting Detroit to win, I decided to bet against them once I saw everyone jump on the bandwagon this year. For many years I bet for Detroit but I had a feeling this year was different. The media made it seem like the Pens had no chance especially by showing these statistics where the home team always wins. Never count a team. Kudos to Talbot, Malkin, & Fleury. Osgood is still the MVP of the playoffs. Great game."

I had the wonderful experience of watching the Cup win with 14 little boys between 6 and 10 years old.   It was AWESOME!   These kids will never forget how awesome it was.  The excitement was ridiculous.  Five observations: 1. Fleury came up HUGE!  I was worried about him.    2. Alot of empty seats in Detroit.   3.  Classless fans.   Booing the Cup winner?  Detroit deserves the misery. 4.  They are getting old.   Pens got to more loose pucks tonite than in any other game.  5. PENS ARE YOUNG!  Jump on the wagon!  Super Bowl and Stanley Cup in same year.       And to be the world's best fisherman, we have the trifecta here in Pittsburgh.    Yeeeeehaaaawww!  Lucky for the world that the Pirates suck, my ego would be worse than it is!"

I'd like to see both teams and all players leave the game with heads high.

They're going pretty deep from where I'm watching. I'm not sure they even noticed Sid was off the bench for part of the second. But can they sustain this pace? Hopefully.  JF"
351573,rickster,2009-06-13 02:01:00,495,  you are right one nice goal or one bad bounce and it is a whole new game and the puck has really been bouncing tonite don't know what is up with the bad ice  franzen hit was a bit late on crosby but was not an intentional knee (or groin) on knee hit
351574,johnnyb,2009-06-13 02:03:00,3413,Sid's back....and I see what somebody meant about the i-desk...it's definitely rated G...A.Y.  A 2 goal lead is certainly not enough insurance against the wings...but if Pitt's defence keeps it up...it might be all right.
350521,Cookslav,2009-06-10 02:58:00,1457," Dude Pitty out shot them out hit them, out scored them.....they out played them. The zone percentage after the 2nd was like 80% in the Detroit defensive? If not for Osgood the score would have been run up grossly."
350523,Cudz,2009-06-10 02:59:00,2652,Are you kidding Stoty? Pit outplayed Detroit throughout the game save for a bit at the end. Osgood was the reason they were still in it. Maybe you didn't watcfh the first 8/9ths of the game.
350524,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-06-10 03:00:00,0,"stoty has demonstrated that he watches the game through red coloured goggles several times already...let him make excuses for his team getting outplayed and let's hope pittsburgh plays game 7 with the same intensity, ESPECIALLY from the 3rd and 4th lines.  anybody else think guerin had a really sloppy and lazy game?"

350555,Marty,2009-06-10 04:00:00,873,"Say what you want Stoty and the other Wings apologists, Detroit has lost 3 of the last 4 games in this series.    The Wings are good and still could win the Cup but they aren't that much better than the Pens.  Now that this series has come down to one game, game 5 is now irrelevant and I just hope Fleury can put one good game together on Wings' ice.  God, I wish the Pens had home ice.   They'd be favored to win that game.  And, by the way, the others are dead on.   Osgood kept that game close.   The Pens dominated the play tonite.   Here's to hoping these kids can find a way to win in Detroit.  And yes, I think Billy Guerin looked sloppy tonite.   Orpik struggled too. Say what you want about Malkin but the guy is the catalyst right now.   I'm hoping Sid hasn't played his best game yet.   Let's get this town a Cup to go along with our Super Bowl trophy."

Detroit is a good team and when ever they get the puck I'm at the edge of my seat. Let the best and most effective team win the Stanley Cup!  Let's Go Pens!  MTBF"
350620,crappieperchhunter,2009-06-10 11:15:00,2582,"The first entire hockey game I have watched all season. The Pens owned 2 periods and the Wings owned the 3rd. Lotsa hitting, great goaltending...at both ends...and the refs let them play. This was the best NHL game I have seen in a long time.  Malkin was a bum last night and could have cost them the game with that dumb arse penalty in the 3rd.  The Pens proved to me last night they can play well enough to beat Detroit. I never believed that before last night.  Too bad I'll be at the cottage...with no cable...for game 7. Which if you believe is superstition, means the Pens will lose...cause if I'm NOT watching the game...the team I am rooting for almost always loses."

350641,Cookslav,2009-06-10 12:29:00,1457," I agree, Whats with Orpik and dropping his stick  It happened about 4 -5 times Last night? Billy was a bit off for sure, no Major mistakes but not as much presence. Malkans a great player offensively most of the time, but he had huge problems gaining the Blue line last night, and gave up some very dangerous turnovers by trying to get to fancy....The whole teams gotta come on strong Friday if they are gonna pull it off. Truth be told I'm not sure fleury is up for it... The Pitty defence had better bring it on, and guys like Malkan better remember what 2 way hockey is all about or the Wings will take it to them.  I'm not sure that 50% of last nights Penguin win was not 50% attributed to the Wings Offence having an off night. Its was shown in spades what the wings can do when the Pens defence is not effective, and by defence I mean back checking forwards as well... Fleury is good, but he's shaken, and Detroit has the guns to Rattle him again.  Lets hope Pitty scores first, and they get confidence quickly...cause we've seen it go the other way and it wasn't pretty"
350650,anders,2009-06-10 12:49:00,1168,"Malkin looked sloppy, yes, but Hossa has been skating with a yellow streak behind him for a while now...almost pathetic!  If Detroit plays like this in 7, they are done!  You cant win a hockey game in the finals when you play the last period.  12 shots by the end of the 2nd for Detroit...thats dominance for ya!!!"
350654,JohnF,2009-06-10 12:57:00,3494,"I think that a whole buncha ""ifs"" will have to come to pass for the Pens to win the cup, but hey, all those ""ifs"" have happened before so why not this time? The cup is there for either team to take, with the home ice advantage to Detroit. I'd say 3-2 odds in Detroit's favour.  JF"

And i think stalls goal in game four where he drove the net , same thing............seems as if hes saying, hey that wasnt my fault, or that was a Bull goal. Puck went in, you didnt stop it? Take a drink of water and stop the puck next time, stop shakin your head lol  Man would i love to see the Pens take this one away from detroit. IN DETROIT!!!

349623,Stoty,2009-06-08 15:02:00,2910,"Alright...let's get the discussion started again...lol........    Speaking of Talbot.......lovely hack on Datsyuk's foot. What a gutless, gutless move.  He just got back because of his foot, and you intentionally target it. Pathetic!"
349624,anders,2009-06-08 15:03:00,1168,"Like i said previously...the return of Draper and Pavel would make a huge difference...but man...5-0....expecting the Pittsburgh to show up not Wilkes Barre  The slash wasnt that bad...its being overblown...seen much worse....its the playoffs, not womens hockey.....The wings arent even make a deal out of it, just the media."
349628,Lunker777,2009-06-08 15:10:00,866,"If the Pens didn't take those stupid penalties, it would have been a different game. There is the prove of inexperience on the Pens behalf.... young team, Came off a BIG win, a little cocky and got off of their game plan all together.  It will be a very exciting game 6 I believe. The Pens will take it and it will go to game 7 ! Just like everyone wanted !  Also my tickets to game 7 should triple in value"
349629,Stoty,2009-06-08 15:13:00,2910," It wasnt a ""bad"" slash....it was however a GUTLESS one."
349631,anders,2009-06-08 15:16:00,1168,"Lots of gutless things go on during a game that the viewer doesnt see, the camera just happened to catch that one...if it was reveresed, you probably wouldnt see it as gutless...just a feeble and weak attempt to gain the puck"
349635,Stoty,2009-06-08 15:29:00,2910," Actually, I would. There's no room in hockey for cheap shots. IMO. No need for that garbage. You dont see any Detroit guy doing that. But then again...they don't need to."
349667,Marty,2009-06-08 16:42:00,873,We Pens fans sure are quiet.  That was a total embarassment.   I'm just glad I was stuck at my daughters' softball game and didn't make myself sit through that game.  I didn't see Talbot's slash but the no call trip/slash at the end of game 4 on Crosby was gutless too.  I can't remember who it was but it was gutless sour grapes when the game was over.
349673,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-06-08 16:55:00,0,"Stoty, your team is predominantly Euros...Are you seriously suggesting there isn't any ""gutless"" stick work going on from Detroit players? If you think that, Don Cherry and I would likely disagree with you."
349674,Lunker777,2009-06-08 17:05:00,866," WOAH WOAH WOAH.... Crosbys act he put on over that ""slash"" to the back of the leg should of got an award... Hes lucky the Wings didn't score on that play. He was CLEARLY trying to draw a penalty . Once the play was at the other end, all of a sudden hes all better. Im not sayin the slash on Datsyuk deserved a penalty because I think I was already asleep for it so I didn't see it.  But you can't compare the play on Crosby to anything that ""deserves"" a penalty ! Its almost like in game 4 when Helm took a slash to the hand.... sitting on the bench with an icepack being attended to by the trainer... that clearly did some damage.... Crosby went to the bench and was out next shift, didn't skip a beat. I consider it ""gutless"" when you lay on the ice for 10-20 seconds trying to act hurt... then when you relaize the play is at the other end and nothing is coming of it... skate off, wait... back on a minute later !"
349720,JohnF,2009-06-08 18:18:00,3494,"Let's face it, both teams' fans can rail on about the other teams dirty stuff with justification, and both teams have divers. Watch when a guy goes down. If the camera's on him you'll almost certainly see a sidelong glance to see if he's got the ref's attention.  After the series is over I'll ask my neighbour what he saw out there. he may or may not tell me. I saw him yesterday and almost called him over but since he's got one more game I figured he'd be cautious about what he said anyway. He's a linesman, btw.  JF"
349723,Cookslav,2009-06-08 18:27:00,1457," uh...ya right. How bout all the goaltender interferance? Those don't qualify right?  Personaly I think its ALL part of Physical series. A little less Body contact, and way more stick play then I would like to see in a traditional Playoff Game. But non the less Its still just part of an emotional high stress playoff game."
349790,MCTFisher9120,2009-06-08 20:29:00,3761,"well, guess the wings decided to let us win the cup off of home ice this year. would of been nice to win at home, but nope now we got to win in the dirty Detroit.  Thanks Wings."
349920,Lunker777,2009-06-09 00:03:00,866," .............? Are you saying ""we"" as in the pegnuins ? If so...."
350134,Marty,2009-06-09 13:42:00,873,"Lunker,  You're talking about a different play.  I know which one you're talking about where he laid on the ice for a bit.  I'm talking about the one that occurred at the end of game 4 with about 2 minutes left.  He didn't lay on the ice at all.   He got right up but it was clearly a penalty.  The one you're talking about was a penalty too but I think that was game 3.  He just embellished it too much."

350513,Stoty,2009-06-10 02:47:00,2910," ya...??  Game 7 in Detroit....  I'm not the one who should be worried.  Pits didn't deserve to win that game, but hey..they got the lucky bounce this time. Fleury made some key saves when needed.  Should be a good game 7."
350517,Cookslav,2009-06-10 02:54:00,1457,"Well this is going to be interesting,  If Pitty plays like tonight, and the Wings bring their game 5 face.....game 7 will be good. But, Am I the only one who thought Malkan looked like a chump tonight? A ton of dipsy doodle plays on the blue line that truned over the puck when he should have been bringing or shooting it in deep? And taking a stupid penalty to boot....geesh Thank God Staal was on fire! With Kennedy adding a point it was the Northern Boys of Ontario stealing the show and bringing it to Detroit!"
350520,rickster,2009-06-10 02:57:00,495,  UHHHHHMMMMMMMM pit outshot outchanced and for the most part outplayed det and yes Fleury did make some key saves (in the the third especially)  but to say they got lucky cmon man give pit the credit they deserve  I could care less who wins but i hope you are right about game 7 It should be a dandy just hope it is a close game
348690,johnnyb,2009-06-05 16:23:00,3413,"This is a great thread...(some minor character assaults notwithstanding)...either way you slice it the hockey is exciting, and you can't help but feel the passion from both sides.  I have been impressed with the skill and control Detroit shows, but I can't help but hoot and holler when the Pens light it up!  Just seems like more heart, and now that they've proven they can outplay the Wings for long enough to win a game, I hope they can keep it going    Bring on the best of 3!!!"

Back to Scoty and his comment-  Pretty sure I myself didn't start to brag after last night's game. I said my plan and I'm going to stick to it. (pg 1) However, some members may of started there bragging after last night's game, but like you, I don't brag nor do i start thready feeling way cocky after 2 back to back wins. Good luck in game 5 and 6."

348815,Cookslav,2009-06-06 01:00:00,1457," I agree... I love the guys who measure the success of a player buy their ""points"" I suppose by a measure of points a guy Like Scott Stevens, Guy Carbonneau, Larry Robinson are what....chumps? How about Danny Cleary? Would you throw him to the dogs cause he's not a point getter? Only 14 ""points"" but  +17 and the TOP plus minus on the team. Do you think Zetterburgs would be doing as well as he is with out him?  Heart of the team if you asked me....  Plus minus actually wins games, and says a lot about a players game play! This measures not only the goals and ""points"" you score, but the plays you set up, the situations you create, and leadership on the ice you provide, and the inspiration you instill in your line mates....and did I mention it minuses the mistakes your on the ice for? If your going to follow a number as opposed to an overall effectiveness an individual character...Plus/minus is a number to follow not ""points""  But FYI,  Syd the Kid has 31 ""points"" and is +12 Malkins has 35 points but is only +3  In a pool sure I might pick Malkin but on my team, and especially my line....Syd is 4x more effective."

(insert Sour grapes here)"
349351,JohnF,2009-06-07 21:12:00,3494,"I guess I kinda fell into the ""Hate The Rich Kid Who's Sucky"" deal along with most of the hard-nosed hockey fans in the world, but the more I watch him, the more I like him. The announcers keep talking about how he works on developing his leg strength and it shows when he goes behind the net one handing the puck while he fends off some horse who probably outweighs him by 50 # or more. He does a lot of things really really well, and he makes or takes passes as well as anyone I can remember being impressed by in the past. He's proving hisself to be the real deal despite what his detractors would love to have us believe. They'd all be getting misty over him if only he played for their team. Yeah, he might have been a bit of a diver, prone to embellishment and whining in the past, but he's evolved into a really great player to watch, except perhaps for last night, but every superstar has bad days. For me Crosby looks like a player at least a notch above Malkin, but for show Malkin and OV are the big dogs. I'll still take a few lines of Crosbys with just a smattering of Malkins and OVs to draw the crowds to pay for the entertainment.  Malkin is great, no doubt about it, but to a different degree. He may mature into a smarter player one day but he's got a lot to learn to be Sid's equal as a contributor. He reminds me so much of OV. He's not quite the hotdog OV is, but he's every bit the MeMe player. Watch how he cruises looking for a break out pass, and then wastes an opportunity by dipseydoodling through the other team usually just getting pushed off the puck. He's not quite as overt as OV about it, simply standing up at the offensive blueline setting a tape target for whoever has the puck, but he's not as smart or as willing to muck for the puck as Sid. Crosby gives away opportunities when he sees guys in better places. Malkin just wants the puck - period. That being said I believe there was a very nice passing play recently when he fed Sid, but those are few and too far between for me.  I wondered if Datsyuk would be in top form when he came back. I guess we got our answer. He kinda owned the play last night. How much of that is having the home ice advantage and very good line management on the bench will be answered in the next game.  I'm knocked out by the depth of Detroit. They're having to sit guys who are playoff stars. Sucks to be Pittsburgh then huh? I guess the unanswered question is will these guys be stars in a few years when the old farts have migrated to the retired players lounge to watch the games. Detroit has pretty good chemistry right now. Can they sustain it without Lidstrom et al?  The Pens looked kinda lost after that initial flurry, speaking of which, I wasn't impressed with Fleury last night, but then even star goalies can't be incredible every night.  The next game will be interesting. Perhaps the Pens will show us that this is a homer series. Whatever they do next I have my doubts they can win the Cup this year, but heaven knows, they're getting closer all the time. If they can keep some of the rear guard guys for a year or two more they're gonna bring that cup home. I'm not sure if I'll be a fan ever. One never knows when the Leafs might pull out of the slump. But unless the Leafs start their inevitable comeback soon I guess Crosby and the Pens will be my default team.  JF"
349381,Cookslav,2009-06-07 22:12:00,1457,"Ditto, And last night proved a point...older or not they got the goods. Nothing pisses and old guy off then being called and old guy LOL!

349399,Chris,2009-06-07 22:56:00,405," Hey ya never know. I haven't had much to cheer about for quite a while but my favorites, the big bad Bruins turned things around in the last couple of years and at least made it out of the first round against those pesky habs. That's like winning the cup right there.   Anything else is just a bonus after that.  Crosby deserves a lot of credit. He performs well even with three wings all over him. Whiner or not who cares, they all whine when it's them....he's a superstar. The wings sure can turn it on when they want, but they are fighting hard for it too. The pens can play up there with them but got caught up in stupid penalties last night. I would hope to see a more disciplined pens next game."

I dont make excuses for Detroit losing, unlike a lot of Pens fans. Detroit looked really sloppy last night, and 3 of the 4 goals, were from turn-overs. Cant argue those. They will be a different team tomorrow night, that's for sure. Hopefully Pavel will be back tomorrow night, and you watch what happens if so!  Keep in mind Detroit has done all this without their top scorer! Just wait till he comes back! Try taking Malkin away from Pitts, and see how they make out.  I also love it how Crosby gets his 2nd & 3rd points in the series...and he's now the hero! LOL He's ben invisible the whole series except for 2 periods last night, now all of a sudden he's the man. Malkin is their whole team, Crosby might as well be up there with his roomie Mario.  Best of 3 series now, with 2 being in Detroit....I like my chances!

348674,Marty,2009-06-05 15:22:00,873,"The Pens have surprised me, for sure.  Didn't think Fleury had it in him.    He still scares me.  Crosby has hardly been invisible.   He's set up more good scoring chances than anyone.   Ask Babcock.  He's tying up the Wings best players and making them chase him all over.   The Wings are devoting so much time to contain him he's making Malkin the most productive player in this series, on the second line nonetheless.  He's made Osgood the second most productive player.  He's had a ton of chances and he's set up even more.   Ozzie's been pretty darn good.  The Wings are starting to argue among themselves on the ice too.  I like that.   Talk about whining, on every draw they were complaining to the refs.  The officiating hasn't been great either way but there is no doubt but they have gotten away alot of neutral zone interference.   The Versus commentators talk about it constantly.   The Pens fans may have been down after being 0-2 (just like any fan would against Detroit) but the only thing worse was the cockiness of the Wings fans.    C'mon Stoty, you know this one isn't over yet.  Odds still favor the Wings but it's going to be a fun ride.   Few bad bounces and goals and the Pens could very well be up in this series.    Barry Melrose said it best.   The Pens weren't sure they had a chance, now they know they do.  The Wings thought it was locked up.  Now they know it's no sure thing.   Attitude favors the Pens.  Sure hope the Wings get some rest.   They sure need it.  In any event, the Pens aren't making a bad showing for a team that had a slim shot at the playoffs with a month left the season.    Being such big underdogs in this series, the pressure is on the Wings."
348684,Carp,2009-06-05 16:03:00,1488,"Not a wings fan and I'd like to see someone else win the cup, so I'm on the Pittsburg bandwagon for this one.  Last night: The look on Zetterburg's face after the last Pittsburg goal summed it all up. Frustration, bewilderment, disappointment !!!  Pens passing was awesome. It was making me dizzy watching from home, so I can just imagine what the Red Wings felt like. The wings are lucky to have only allowed 4 goals. It could have been much worse.  Having said that, I think Detroit will come out strong in game 5. What happens after that is a crap shoot."
347545,Cookslav,2009-06-02 23:34:00,1457,I wish there was a junior game on LOL!...
347577,acmarou,2009-06-03 00:55:00,63,Pitt just tied it and if anybody wants to take a bet. I will take the boys in red.
347607,acmarou,2009-06-03 02:07:00,63,20 min left  you bad boys!!!!!!
347627,rickster,2009-06-03 02:35:00,495,she aint over yet stoty 4-2 now
347628,johnnyb,2009-06-03 02:36:00,3413,How come Detroit couldn't hit the empty net the past two nights?  Talbot only needed about 5 seconds
347629,BillM,2009-06-03 02:36:00,17367,"Pens got a game back, looking forward to game 4."
347633,danbouck,2009-06-03 02:39:00,4380,uh oh
347639,acmarou,2009-06-03 02:49:00,63,Nobody did it !!!!!!  Next Game!!!!!! Any Takers!!!!  pm me.
347653,acmarou,2009-06-03 03:27:00,63,My Boys lost this one. A hard fought battle. I think the old farts will come back and do some damage. The young guns better start praying cuz they'll need it. Thoz old buggers aint happy and watch what happens next game.  cheers
347686,Chris,2009-06-03 10:03:00,405,"Wow, Pittsburg dominated the Wings!!!"
347694,MCTFisher9120,2009-06-03 11:04:00,3761," Good thing you didn't. Seems very like the Washington series all over again...Only difference is were against a group of older players.  Good game last night, better game tomorrow night."
347708,Stoty,2009-06-03 11:43:00,2910," Yes it is, lol. Detroit will win it at home now."
347715,acmarou,2009-06-03 12:05:00,63,Everybody has been saying Detroit is too old since the mid 90's.  :lol:  I still think the old boys will come through in the end.  Cheers
347738,anders,2009-06-03 12:49:00,1168, 
347749,Stoty,2009-06-03 12:56:00,2910," If you think the only difference is their age....you might wanna follow hockey a little more. Detroit is the most skilled team (by far) in the league, unlike WSH who has 4 guys. Detroit has the best combination of 4 lines in the league. All 4 of their lines score, no other team even comes close in depth."
347755,acmarou,2009-06-03 13:02:00,63,You got that right Stoty!!!
347759,anders,2009-06-03 13:24:00,1168," They do have depth, but i do think boston could match that depth with there 4 line.  They just ran into a hot goaltender."
347764,Stoty,2009-06-03 13:32:00,2910,"I agree, that Boston is also a well balanced team. To be honest...I think they would put up a better fight than Pits is/will."
347859,brifishrgy,2009-06-03 17:17:00,559, you are one funny guy .... cant wait for reality to set in for ya
347897,solopaddler,2009-06-03 18:06:00,8605,Wow there sure are a lot of cocky Wings fans. Careful boys crow isn't a very tasty dish to eat.
347947,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-06-03 19:32:00,0,my stanley cup was almost 2 months ago!  it happened when the habs were eliminated!  i've been celebrating since!
347951,blaque,2009-06-03 19:41:00,2419," Didnt you know that if you've never strapped on a pair of skates, you cant possibly know a THING about the game?   Oooooor if you disagree with stoty......same result, better brush up"
348209,Stoty,2009-06-04 12:14:00,2910,"Well, if you think that the only difference between Wsh/Det is their age...you're right...you dont know a thing about hockey!"
348373,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-06-04 19:13:00,0," This is true.  Washington is a team that's still building and Detroit is a team that consistently drafts well, and is as close to a dynasty we've had since the 80's.  That said, I hope the pens wipe the rink with zetterberg's big ass beard tonight."
348377,Lunker777,2009-06-04 19:24:00,866,"Detroits my team... But I have tickets to game 7 now, so I need it to go 7 games !"
346877,brifishrgy,2009-06-01 14:38:00,559,  guess you didn't watch the Anaheim series  Have a few of them lucky bounces and get the refs on their side and the series would be 2-0 Pens
346883,JohnF,2009-06-01 14:45:00,3494," That doesn't say a lot about the three guys it's taking to contain him regularly. I'm pretty impressed that Detroit has enuf respect for that ""Pretty Boy"" to have three men on him every time he crosses the blue line. They'd be in trouble if the Pens had more depth, or perhaps they just need a few more Pretty Boys.  Ya can't help being impressed with Detroit's execution.  JF"
346886,blaque,2009-06-01 14:51:00,2419,"Yes, they passed two out of two tests....2-0, looks good on paper, but with an average grade of 66%? I used to get the paddle for a 66%, even though i ""passed"". If your happy getting a passing grade by the skin of your teeth, so be it. And I didnt make up the 4 periods out of 6 ratio.......remember?   Domination may occur in the next few games, but not to date. To me domination is complete and utter control at all times......or at least 90-95% (this is all in good fun btw)"
346889,blaque,2009-06-01 14:56:00,2419," Ahhh, a voice of reason in an otherwise grossly exaggerated conversation"
346901,JohnF,2009-06-01 15:37:00,3494," Surely you can't mean that when it comes from a bunch of your fellow OFNers?  These are guys used to being entirely honest about the fish they catch, after all.  JF"
346982,anders,2009-06-01 18:51:00,1168,Im actually quite bored with gms 1 and 2...and I dont think Detroit is dominating...they are just domintating the crease...which is the main reason they are leading.  Not over by any stretch of the imagination...it will be an interesting gm 3 and 4.
346986,Lunker777,2009-06-01 19:03:00,866,"Detroit is my team. So ofcourse Im a little Biased.  Hossa, in game one, did cover the puck which should have been a penalty shot. Can't blame the wings for that though, the Ref didn't do his job. In game 2, he DID NOT cover the puck, in the replay showing a view from the front of the net you can clearly see the puck on the ice WITH OUT Hossa covering it. Now lucky bounces in hockey are part of the game. Sometimes they go your way, some times they dont. At the moment, Detroit has them going there way. Frustration is a huge part of the game aswell... the Pens are to young of a team, they are VERY frustrated right now. Malkin proved that with his rediculous show at the end of the game last night with Zetterburg. He honestly looked like a kid throwing a fit. He was tossing hay makers with his stick still in his hands ??? Come on now... that was just embarrasing. Fleury hasn't shown up in this series yet. Detroits first goal was a lucky bounce off the boards, but other than that they have been good goals. Osgood is amazing. He does not get the credit he deserves. Crosby, well for being 21, and the leader of an NHL team at such a young age. I think he is doing a pretty good job. He also hasn't shown up in this series yet either. Last night hit the post and if Osgoods pad would have been about .25"" lower to the ice, he would have had a goal and a tie game. But again, the bounce just didn't go his way. To the person who said Crosby is a ""whiney baby"" maybe you should check out his team mate Malkin.... Pens. coach should have called a time out when they iced the puck after that long shift. That was a mistake on his part and in turn, Detroit capitalized.  Detroit has so much talent right across the board. To expect to win against them with a couple star players. Well its not going to happen. I wanted to see an exciting series as much as anyone else. But on the other hand... its just as sweet to watch Detroit teach the young Pens how to win !  Detroit in 5 games. ( I say that only so they can win at home  ) haha"
346991,johnnyb,2009-06-01 19:17:00,3413,"Detroit is impressive, but they've been getting the lucky end of the bounces...plain and simple.  They may have more self-control and discipline overall, and be less likely to be rattled, compared to the Pens...but so far they aren't winning these games by domination, or even on their own merits entirely.  Pittsburgh has shown that they can outplay them...but only in spurts.  Good hockey either way you cut it, and I'm not a devoted fan of either team, but the more I watch, the more I want to see the Pens win, or at least see Detroit earn their goals instead of get lucky bounces."
347004,Troit,2009-06-01 20:03:00,19,There is no explanation on why Detroit will win the Cup...  again the cup stays in the Motor City
347044,MCTFisher9120,2009-06-01 22:11:00,3761, Well they may get it done in 7...letting the wings get at least a 3rd win.
347087,bigpikemike,2009-06-01 23:48:00,52,im a sens fan so i too am bias....he may be a pretty boy but he has great skill
347141,holdfast,2009-06-02 01:01:00,1813,"All I got to say are the NHL's Best teams are out.  This is Boring again.  What we are watching is not a Stanley Cup.  But a QMJHL game.  Just the way Crosby and the Europeans like it.  Gad Fleury, Crosby, Malkin, Datsyuk, on and on and on and on.  We are witnessing the two weakest Stanley Cup finalists in the past two years.  This is Brutal watching this Malarkey."
347177,Pigeontroller,2009-06-02 01:54:00,2793,I'm starting to hate Wings fans as much as Habs fans!  Can't wait till the Leafs have a team again...
347242,Stoty,2009-06-02 03:56:00,2910, I'd like to know what you're smoking...because I'd love to get some of that stuff!
347249,Troit,2009-06-02 04:09:00,19,"^^^well said^^^  besides stick work, best hockey ive seen in a while"
347252,holdfast,2009-06-02 04:23:00,1813," Come on now.  This reminds me of Watching the old 12 team Leagues.  The Canadians Playing St Louis.  Remember those awful games.  Just like now.  Like I said, looks like a rec league game.  Lack of hitting, Lots of Jawing, some Biting and Girly slaps and the odd pinch in the scrum.  Just like the European and women's leagues.  Then again, look at what you got for a team.  Too bad the good teams played each other and due to attrition we end up with LOL Pittsburgh and Detroit.  Too tell ya the truth, I think the only interest in these Games are in Southern Ontario, Detroit and Pittsburgh.  Otherwise, I don't think the ratings get any better anywhere else."
347255,holdfast,2009-06-02 04:37:00,1813, You got to get out more as I can see you lead a sheltered life.  Watch some Junior vs Russia/USA games before you tell me how good this series is.
347301,blaque,2009-06-02 12:22:00,2419,"I duno, i havent watched every minute of both games, but it seems to have been pretty Bland.  I think Orpik hit Hossa once in game one, and the commentators acted like he ripped his head off, when in reality.........he bumped him off his skates to the ice. Which should happen every time a guy touches the puck LOL! You'da thought it was Cambell hitting umberger lol. Ok, maybe they didnt go that nuts    But i think holdfasts point is geared more toward a let it all hang out, rock em sock em, give blood play hockey type request. And i agree. If i want to watch an All Star game, Ill watch the All Star game lol"
347310,Cookslav,2009-06-02 12:37:00,1457,"Deja vous.... Boreing series for me unfortunatly...don't particularily like either team, and have been unimpressed thus far by either team which is Weird considering this is the cream of the crop Maybe I'm biased or something? My 2 cents... Detroits to deep to be beat by Pittsburgh IMO, but I'd like to see it just to build some rivalry."
347338,Troit,2009-06-02 13:37:00,19," A sheltered life, wife, kids, work, fishing, my bussiness....no shelter here  I think your just to old to realize good hockey when ya see it...this is not the 60s  cheers"
347463,acmarou,2009-06-02 20:33:00,63,"I am by no means an expert like some of you , but I put my money down on Detroit before the playoffs started. I actually gave a guy every other team and I took Detroit. I'm a Leaf fan, but you would have to be an idiot not to appreciate a great organization like the Red Wings. They've won or contended for quite a few years now and anyone that can't appreciate that should give their head a shake. They are what every sports organization strives to be.  Cheers"
347468,MCTFisher9120,2009-06-02 20:47:00,3761," I agree, also a Leafs fan. However, yes Detroit is a really good team, but how much better can they get. I mean, this team is very mature and well inquired and close to there prime in Hockey today. Look at the Pens, making finals 2 years in a row with such a young team that has more than enough time to get even better, watch out for this club, look how well there doing already. Wait until they further improve on there success, and most importantly, wait until the time runs out at the end of game 4 to see where this series is going.  Mike"
347472,blaque,2009-06-02 20:58:00,2419,"wait until they all want multimillion dollar contracts because theyve attained the finals two years in a row (and possibly a cup if they come back to win this series) and feel they deserve more money, each and every one of them.........wait till that happens and the team is dismantled because they cant stay under the cap and pay everyone what they want at the same time. lol"

346745,holdfast,2009-06-01 02:53:00,1813,Another weak and Boring Stanely Cup.  Two years in a Row now.  Don Cherry sumed it up at the End.  Pittsburg could not control their own Crease.  Reminds me of ther Cowardly Habs.  Goes to show how weak the East is.  Wake me up when its over.
346746,timmeh,2009-06-01 02:53:00,609,"Ya Pittsburgh's in trouble, but it's too bad, they've been unlucky. They have been the better team so far but they won't stop the wings now. Hopefully they can win a couple just to make it interesting.  Didn't see Crosby do anything though so I'm not sure what you're complaining about. This guy will be leading team Canada for the next 20 years so I'm wondering why everyone hates him. I'm not a huge Crosby fan either, but I still think it's kinda ridiculous the way people complain about him."
346748,holdfast,2009-06-01 02:55:00,1813, Because he is a Pretty Boy.  Should be playing Soccer
346749,Stoty,2009-06-01 02:59:00,2910," HAHA  Guess you missed the 4 times he slashed/cross-checked guys when they were skating off, or after the game.  Holdfast hit the nail on the head.... pretty boy!  What series have you been watching?!?!? Detroit has completely shut them down, and dominated both games."
346770,Sebastian,2009-06-01 03:28:00,208,"Detroit is too solid of a team but you cant count the Pens out yet.  Crosby,Malkin and Ovechkin are star players but Ovechkin has tremendous heart. Ovie #1 in my books."
346779,timmeh,2009-06-01 04:30:00,609,"  Was he the only player out there slashing and cross-checking? Isn't that what happens in the playoffs? I'm sure he takes more than he gives out.  As far as shutting them down, Pitt did hit 3 posts tonight, and could have been given 2 penalty shots this series. Osgood has been great but the wings have certainly not dominated both games. I think they played much better last series against the hawks then they have in the final. But they are up 2-0, and that's all that anyone will remember, and will likely be raising the cup in a week."
346784,[email protected],2009-06-01 05:09:00,97,"What series have you been watching?!?!? Detroit has completely shut them down, and dominated both games.    Now now now...I'm totally rooting for the wings but I don't think you can say they dominated both games...they had their periods...and they won both games cause they capitalized on the pens mistakes which was AWESOME!!...They are definitely gonna have to up their game for the two road games....They are allowing way too many shots at Osgood even if they aren't well screened.....Surprised the mule dint score tonight (how i wish he was a Senator...sigh!)....Wings in 5!!  Cry baby will always be a whiny b!@T(H....the guy needs a little bit more off ice/camera presence or charisma...I blame Cherry!!  Should Abdelkader's goal tonight be considered the new pitsburgh floater?! I guess it aint as good as the original...if you guys haven't noticed yet, I have a huge hate on for Crosby and Fleury....  Go Wings! N"
346788,alphaalpha,2009-06-01 09:11:00,475," agreed, i'm also a wings fan but a couple of bounces the pen's way and both the games could have been completely changed.  I'm hoping everyone wins their home games and it goes to 7 as i have tickets for it."
346795,MCTFisher9120,2009-06-01 10:57:00,3761,"Big mistake to win the first 2 games, look at Washington. The Pens will win the Cup this year after they push the series to six(winning the cup at home).  However, a game 7 would be unreal.   Let's Go Pens."
346805,Stoty,2009-06-01 11:44:00,2910, You think Pittsburgh will come back and beat Detroit 4 straight??  :lol:  :lol:  Just like last year....not happening my friend.
346806,blaque,2009-06-01 11:56:00,2419,"Wings........hate em, always have...... always will. Unless they are fried up with lots O' Hot Sauce  Unfortunately, i think Pittsburg is sunk..........i think they've won a period or two, so maybe they can build off that. But it sure looks dismal."
346808,BillM,2009-06-01 12:08:00,17367," Oh yeah, completely shut them down with two Bull goals the first game and a non call on Hossa for the second goal in the game lastnight.  Did you miss the complete second period in the first game where the Penguins completely dominated them?  You Detroit nutwingers crack me up, completely oblivious to the real world.  How many posts have the Penguins hit?  Imagine if those pucks were a few more inches to the right or to the left?  Completely different series.  Detroit has skill, but to say lady lucky hasn't played a role is laughable."
346810,Stoty,2009-06-01 12:11:00,2910,"LOL  Pens fans get kinda bitter eh?!  Hitting posts doesn't mean they are dominating anything. The difference is...Detroit's pucks are going in.  Detroit has won 4 of 6 periods in the series, hands down. That's called domination.  And not too sure who said anything about Detroit not being lucky?"
346811,bushart,2009-06-01 12:14:00,2628,Ok 1st I'm a sens fan so I am not biased.  Been watchin this game since the leafs last won the cup and Experience says...  Detroit right now is like a machine and handle the game like the 80's Oilers..  Everyone raves on and on about Roy and Brodeur but I think Osgood has more rings than Roy...  Currently there is not another team (East or West) that measures up---I cannot believe it's all skill---some must be coaching cause the Swedish olympic team is not as crafty as these guys and there's a lot of Swedes on Detroit.  They definetely got their mojo goin  Bushart
346812,BillM,2009-06-01 12:17:00,17367,"I'm not a Pens fan at all, my team is in the running for the first draft pick  :)  I dunno how you can say Detroit is dominating anything.  The Penguins have been playing just as good and just as hard, they just haven't gotten the bounces the Wings have.  The series could easily be 1-1, or dare I say 2-0 Pens.   Gotta have luck and Detroits had a pocket full the last 2 games.  Lets see how Detroit handles them in Pittsburg, I think that's going to be their first real test of this series.  Regardless of how it turns out (I don't care either way) it's been the best hockey in a while."
346814,Stoty,2009-06-01 12:19:00,2910, You've got that right.
346835,paulyboy83,2009-06-01 13:21:00,54,"  Detroit won the first two in last years series as well.  As a matter of fact they kept the Pens off the score sheet until game 3 last year.  There isn't a team in the league that's going to win 4 straight against Detroit in the final.  They are like a well oiled machine.  They may not have looked all that exceptional the first 2 games this series, but once they get rolling, they only get better and will really start to shut the Pens down.  I think Pittsburgh may win one game but I believe this series is done in 5 games.  Detroit has 4 lines that score goals.  Pittsburgh has 3 guys that score goals.  Just can't measure up.  The Pens didn't face a challenging team until this round.  The east is the much weaker conference.  PB"
346836,Marty,2009-06-01 13:22:00,873,"The Pens are in trouble.  Down 2-0 is real bad for them.  However, to say that Detroit has dominated the play demonstrates you haven't watched the games or you're just stoking the fire.    They have, however, dominated the score board and three bad goals given up by a goalie who like to flop around like a fish and an uncharacteristic inability to finish some tremendous scoring opportunities have put the Pens where they are.   The Wings will win at least one here."
346849,blaque,2009-06-01 13:56:00,2419," 66% win percentage so far (based on your assessment) is not domination lol  If you get a 66% on a physics examination.........i highly doubt the professor would say that you ""Dominated"" the exam"
346850,Stoty,2009-06-01 14:01:00,2910,"4/6 periods, and 2-0 in games, is domination in hockey. Like I said at the start of the season...no one will touch Detroit again this year.  Just like Paulyboy said...."
346853,BillM,2009-06-01 14:04:00,17367, Domination would be 6-0 games with most of the time spent in the Pittsburg end.  Neither of those games even came close to that.
