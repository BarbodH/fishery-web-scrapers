Only caught panfish and bass...lots of little ones and one biggie.  Had the most luck tossing small Rap's and spinners in shallow water, especially around rocky and weedy shorelines.  There are a couple of deep spots in the lake (over 100 feet), but I didn't see anyone fishing them...heard rumours of lakers.  It's a beautiful area!"
