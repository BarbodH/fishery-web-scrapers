It's on Mazinaw Lake and I was wondering if there is any decent fishing there and what species. I heard there was Pike, Bass and Lake Trout since it's such a deep lake.  Any suggestions and tips would be greatly appreciated.  Peter"

Walleyes were caught trolling taildancers with clipon weights and 14lb fire line, and walleye divers as well. Good luck  also southend of the lake on the smarts marina produced most of the walleyes, as well as the sandbar on the southend as well right at the point where it drops off to deep water.  Smarts marina has a map of the lake with some fishing areas listed as well as great icecream for you and your son."
