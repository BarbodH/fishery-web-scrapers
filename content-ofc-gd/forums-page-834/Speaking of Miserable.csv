350694,lookinforwalleye,2009-06-10 14:24:00,4399,Imagine that it`s the summer driving season and the oil companies are pushing prices up!!!  Judging by the number of gas guzzling SUV`s on the highways doing 140 km/hr I would summize that the price may not high enough!

350863,Tybo,2009-06-10 23:15:00,1373,Oh BOY oh BOY. Roy said I get to bring the guns out against the tyranny of the government. Oops wrong country. The Americans have every thing.
350874,siwash,2009-06-10 23:29:00,683," So what political party is going to bring you lower gas prices??! Come on, don't be so friggin naive...  Gas prices are a function of what I posted previously... there's no conspiracy or plot to control us... China and India are consuming 10,00000000 times more energy than just 5 years years ago..mainly because they are now supplying us with lots of cheap priducts! this is actually good for canada and one of the reasons we haven't sunken into an even deeper recession... we're a commodity-rich country and we sell to the world... unfortunately this does not mean we will get gas for free, even though we still pay very little for gas when compared to most industrialized countries... much less.. Europeans are paying the equivalent of $2.50/litre!! how's that sound?  Being ""independent"" as a previous poster submitted, whatever that means, won't get you cheaper gas either!   Like I said, downsize... or look to sensible alternatives if possible, like diesel engines.."
350922,holdfast,2009-06-11 01:49:00,1813," Just heard some YARDBIRD (supposed oil watchdog) say on the Radio that Gas Prices will level to around $1.20 national average, but Diesel will continue to rise.  GO Figure eh even YOUR alternative plan has been compromised."
350929,Jigger,2009-06-11 02:02:00,1237,"um, gas prices are going up? Never thought that would happen again. Step onto the Northbound DVP before Steeles at about 3PM with a bunch of your friends and protest your cause. Otherwise, deal with it."

350998,Chris,2009-06-11 10:27:00,405, Who's being naive??? The oil company execs announced last year that oil prices would rise dramatically because of a shortage. This year they are claiming that they need to hike prices because demand is down. If you think this is not one huge gigantic scam you are the one being naive.
351005,12footspringbok,2009-06-11 11:22:00,459,Yup all about down sizing. Worse comes to worse might have to pick myself up one of these bad boys and i can start scooter pooling with a few guys from work!

351018,holdfast,2009-06-11 12:20:00,1813," Just so you Know where Im coming from Raf.  I will never ever trust a financial advisor again, especially Banks.  Look what its done to the USA Economy and some say caused the World Recession.  Like the Oil and Car Executives.  They used our money to gain for themselves and got away with murder."
351029,Cookslav,2009-06-11 12:50:00,1457,"For now we gotta put up with the bull.... Choices are limited to your financial limits(ie. Electric/hybrid cars)  As the Hybrids, and electric cars make their way into the mainstream its cutting into the oil company profits...so they adjust accordingly. But at some point the shift will happen... These former concept cars will out number the older gas models, and if the oil companies want to continue being viable at the business levels they have become acustom to the prices will have to sink into the basement in order to entice consumers or that will be the end of the gravy train for them. 10 years from now or sooner we'll start hearing them whine...be patient"
351031,Handlebarz,2009-06-11 13:06:00,3790,"  You forgot my favorite one there is a big storm out in the Ocean it might hit land it might come close to a refinery we might get wet yep Price goes up. That one always makes me laugh and cry at the same time not much we can do, as a trucker when I have my CB on in the USA I here alot of people daily whining about the prices and nothing gets done they all end the same way I cant afford to shut my truck down for a couple weeks to get the point across. Like others have said grin and take it just buy some KY so it dont hurt as much."
351034,Jonny,2009-06-11 13:41:00,1380,"Just in case you don't know, this site can help a little:  http://www.ontariogasprices.com/index.aspx...mp;tme_limit=24  You can search updated local gas prices at specific stations, or prices elsewhere. In the menu at the top, find ""Gas Prices Map"". You can get a clickable-draggable map of Canada and zoom in on particular areas. There's also a link above the map of Canada for a map of US prices.  If I'm going from North Bay to Sudbury, which is often, I'll check prices and see where a fill-up would be cheaper.  A couple of years ago, when I travelled through the States to the west coast, I used the US map to help me decide where I would fill up. Saved me a few bucks."

What? 0only $70 dollars a Barrel.  Lets compare to Last year.  $130 a Barrel and $1.21 at the pumps.  THIEVES!!!!!!!!  If anybody, anybody has any good Ideas on stopping this Thievery let me know.

350514,timmeh,2009-06-10 02:49:00,609,"I understand the frustration but there's nothing you can do. You know it, I know it, and the gas companies know it too. That's why it happens. Until we develop alternative fuel sources, that can be produced and used on a large scale, there's nothing we can do. They will continue to bend us over and stick it to us whenever they feel inclined.  They only thing you really can do is try to drive less, though that's not possible for some. Or if you're really sick of it when you buy your next car make sure it's fuel efficient."
350529,Dara,2009-06-10 03:10:00,3052,  Thats pretty funny. They want alternative sources so they can rip us off  on them too

350557,Jonny,2009-06-10 04:11:00,1380,Typical gas company crap. Price per bbl drops - you get a cent or two off per liter at the pumps. Price per bbl rises - you get whacked by a big increase.  Even big gov't can't tackle big business (i.e. oil companies). Not that they mostly even want to try.
350567,Guest gbfisher,2009-06-10 04:27:00,0,  I think there'd have to be a POLL but I know you'd like to see it.
350569,Roy,2009-06-10 04:33:00,13728," You guys need to read a little more and try to understand that big business IS the government.

350572,Cudz,2009-06-10 04:45:00,2652,Got it. Warrant officer is respectable indeed.
350577,Fishnwire,2009-06-10 05:01:00,983,"Unless we smarten up and elect ourselves a government that doesn't accept political contributions from the oil and gas companies, we certainly never will see a change.  However, considering most major elections are won by the candidate who spends the most money, it's unlikely we'll ever see a government that isn't a lapdog of big business.  How could it be more obvious that the gas companies are guilty of collusion?  We're taught that the beauty of a free-market system is that sellers providing the same goods or services will be forced to compete, price being one area in which they attempt to out-do each other.  Why do we not see any evidence of this dynamic?  They claim the frequent increases in the cost at the pump is ""driven by market forces,"" or that they exist on ""a razor-thin profit margin.""  Nonsense.  Their profits often increase by several hundred percent from year to year.  The really scary thing is the realization that these people will never be happy with how enormous their profits are.  They'll always want more, and making less will simply not be an option.  A lot of people will be eager to suggest that what the government needs to do is lower taxes on gas.  Lower taxes are great, but there's a couple of problems there.  First of all if the government lowers the tax on gas by a penny a litre today, the gas companies would increase price by a penny and a half tomorrow.  Let's be realistic.  We would never see that break in the form of lower prices at the pump.  Secondly, most of the tax on gas is levied at a per litre basis.  At one time it was 14.7 cents per litre federally and 10 cents per litre provincially.  I'm not sure if that's what it is now. There's also either GST or PST, I forget which one...but my point is that when the price of gas doubles (for example), the overall taxes collected by the government does not double, not even close.  For every penny the price of gas goes up, the percentage of tax you pay on a litre of gas goes down.  Why should the public coffers be deprived of monies just so profitable corporations can go on making bigger profits?  Lower taxes on gas is sadly, not the answer...IMO."
350590,pikehunter,2009-06-10 09:04:00,1659,"Gas prices are one of the great mysteries of our world. Demand goes up a little, the price goes up. Dollar goes down, price goes up. Per barrel crude price goes up, price goes up. Price per barrel crude goes down, price goes up. Price per barrel steady, price goes up. No matter what happens there is always an excuse turned around to favour them.  Go figure.  No matter how much we carp and whine it's going to always be the same. The big guys got you by the curlies   and they will keep pulling.   Only thing we can do is quit driving...as if we can do that.  There are going to be many changes to our lifestyles in the future as we become more and more conscious of energy costs."

350602,Chris,2009-06-10 10:36:00,405, Unbelievable. Gas price is one of the things that helped get us in the economic situation we're in now. How is it not important when some families have to choose between gas to get to work or food for the table. There are people living on less than you in this world ya know. It's just pushing more people under the poverty line.
350611,12footspringbok,2009-06-10 11:03:00,459," ^^^ We have a winner!  But seriously, it is all about being independant and will be more and more everyday. My personal goal is to one day live self sufficiently by going off the grid with solar, wind, and geothermal. I know it may sound far fetched but i hope to one day achieve this. Then i can buy a little plug in electric car for errands and going to work, and keep the truck at home for the weekends. I then won't have to worry so much about being bent over with ever increasing fuel costs."
350619,siwash,2009-06-10 11:13:00,683,Gas will be at $1.50/litre within the next little while...   the fact is prices for gas are going up across the globe for a number of reasons... mostly supply/demand - it's a commodity that has limited quantities and there a a number of very large countries that are eating up a lot more oil than was the case only 10 years ago  this is going to change what you drive (on the road and water...)  downsize!
350665,Jonny,2009-06-10 13:23:00,1380," Admirable, and a great goal. The problem of course is that there are LOTS of people who can't afford the installations, or two vehicles. They are the ones who suffer the most when gas prices are high enough for the oil companies to be raking in cash, and they're likely the last to have such options.  Some of them are fortunate enough to be able to cut their own wood for heating. That's about as oil-dependence-free as they can get."
