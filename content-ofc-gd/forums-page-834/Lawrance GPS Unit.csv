350775,Stoty,2009-06-10 19:06:00,2910,"I need a GPS unit for the front of my boat.  Something similar to the Lowrance 522 iGPS. Needs to be Lawrance though, because I want to network both units together.  Anyone looking to unload one, or know of someone who is?  Cheers, *Stoty"
350789,Garry2Rs,2009-06-10 19:22:00,1425,I have one that I will sell you. I broke the transducer and the GPS unit in a crash and the replacement parts cost as much as a new unit...grin.

351111,Roy,2009-06-11 17:39:00,13728,Thanks Billy Bob. I hadn't seen that one. Great link.
351187,ecmilley,2009-06-11 22:14:00,2163,Paul at kawartha lakes outdoors in bobcaygeon was selling the gps on his ranger (at least last week) it was a lowrance unit
351199,Billy Bob,2009-06-11 22:37:00,5865,The Lowrance LMS 520/522 units are getting hard to find since Lowrance is now producing the newer HDS units.
351277,Stoty,2009-06-12 01:22:00,2910,Thanks for the links!
