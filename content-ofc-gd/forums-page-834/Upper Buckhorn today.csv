Fish are more active than they were a few days ago.  Boat traffic increased and it was becoming anoying so I moved on over to Buckhorn lake.  Found some nice sized perch and a few wgsf.  Started targeting walleye and came up with a few OOS bass.  Then out of now where on a weedline in about 7 FOW i hook into my first decent walleye for 2009.  Grabbed the new net and slimed it for the first time.  Measured 19.5 inches.            This one put up a decent fight and was released to fight another day.  After the walleye more perch etc.  I watched as an impressive storm rolled through towards the south.  I managed to stay dry  After it let up I called it a day.  Hoping to get back out tomorrow"
