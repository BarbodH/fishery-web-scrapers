Changed everything in the front end, and to no avail. Finally someone was looking at the truck from a bit of a distance, and said, the front end isn't quite even, one side is higher than the other. They walked back, took a look, and found a shock on side was seized(up, down, cannot remember). It never occurred to them to look at the shocks. Changed the shock, and everything was alright(after all the bushing changes, alignments, tire re-balancing, etc.etc. lol)."

I'm glad to hear that you're finally getting that back problem looked after!! Good luck with the surgery and I've got tons of room in the pontoon boat for you.....Can you say MUSKIE  ....the season opens here on the Ottawa R. the day of your surgery, so what a better way to recoup then sitting in a comfy boat trolling a big bucktail around  Let me know...."

The back is a whole other issue but I can deal with that.  After the arms heal I have to do 6 months of intense physio on the muscles in my back/shoulders because my muscles are not working properly and dont support my shoulders naturally like most people.  I always have to tense them to support them and that leads to the pain. And actually I have to leave now to the hospital for pre-op crap so I will talk soon.  Don"

349397,Dara,2009-06-07 22:52:00,3052,"Its a Ford thing. From 04 to at least 08. I had an 04 and the service guys put it on a warranty recall thing. He said Ford was trying to figure it out but had no fix for it yet. I took an 08 out for a test drive and it did the same thing. I even asked the guy and he said...yep...they still do that. You gotta find the sweet spot and you can make it do it whenever you want after that. One did it at 80kmph, the other was about 86. Some as high as 120 from what he said Go try to find the speed. Creep up really slowly and you will find it. In the beginning they put a vibration damper under the back bumper. This helped a bit but not totally cured. The smell is something different. That I don't know, unless you kept it vibrating for a long time and caused it."

Having said that............besides this wobble problem, i would really get those brakes serviced especially before you go on your road trip. More beer money, but alot cheaper than what could happen if you step on the pedal and cant stop. I went over on my brakes once........and that was a long time ago.............when i found out how much more a brake job was when the pads were gone and the studs of the pads were digging into the rotors. Now i ask a mechanic to take a look at them every time its taken in for service. Ive had this truck about 2 years and just took it in for an oil change and had the brakes looked at , with about 36,000 miles on it, he siad they were about 60% gone.........  Preventive maintenance on your vehicle is probably one of the biggest money savers going!!"

I'm praying that it is the wheel bearings so that Whitespinnerbait picks up the tab as he mentioned in his post yesterday!!!!....what a GREAT GUY!!!

Better to do it now than have to get a tow from 40 miles deep in the bush.  Or it's a loose nut behind the wheel!!!!!!"

Check the rear diff gear oil make sure there is no shinney specs in it pinnion and carrier bearings are common and can cause the seals to leak

I had a 1999 Expedition and the ball joints practically fell out at about 100k kms. Fords are notorious for weak front ends and wheel bearings. The rest of the truck is good, you just have to be aware of these weaknesses and have the truck serviced and repaired. Let us know how it goes."

Sometimes a wheel will go out of balance in the winter months because of ice build up on one area of the wheel but it's not that in June....did you travel any muddy roads to cause this ? ? ?  After that has be eliminated from the equation I would then look at a brake hanging up somewhere...that means it could be a front caliber or rear is your truck has disc brakes all the way around.... The easiest way to diagnosist this is when it's happing by pulling over and checking each wheel for excessive heat build up. If so you just found your problem. The burning smell tells me you have a bad brake somewhere on you truck.....jack up each wheel and see if that wheel spins freely, if not you have a problem right there....   Bob"

It's also not going to suddenly come and go like his problems seems to be doing.  I would guess maybe strut mounts, the steering stabilizer or even ball joints.  Any chances a CV is binding up causing this?  I'd definitely look at the entire front of the of truck (balljoints, tierods, CV's, etc) and see what's going on."
