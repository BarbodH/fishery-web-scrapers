The Yamaha has a couple of pointed bosses on motor support that now rest against the aluminum transom and actually keep the whole engine support from completely sitting flush against the transom. After my first test ride it seems as there is some minute movement between the two making a bit of a snapping sound when I throttle up or down. So now I wonder if I should be putting a piece of wood on the back of the transom for the motor to sit against, any thoughts?"
