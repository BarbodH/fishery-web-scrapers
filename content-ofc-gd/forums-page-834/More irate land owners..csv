351478,solopaddler,2009-06-12 19:59:00,8605,Actually the landowners do fish there. Not sure about now but they used to employ a riverkeeper to watch over their stretch of river.
351479,ptmpete,2009-06-12 20:02:00,49," Classy   So you found out she owned the whole show an squeezed a canoe up there to rub her face in it ? HAHA look I am deep into your Prop and you cant do anything  Well if you stopped trespassing you would not have to sneak around feeling like you are doing something wrong   I am for farm land up north I have never seen a fence across a river ,creeks and streams yes ,and I would not want to be you if you cut a farmers fence to fish his stream and released his livestock   Just making a point If you don't know find out first"
351480,Jonny,2009-06-12 20:09:00,1380,"No idea what your MNR is like down there, but does it sound dumb to contact the MNR first to see what they know about the stretch of water in question? Then, if you don't get a straight answer, look into it further?"
351481,solopaddler,2009-06-12 20:11:00,8605, The question of ownership in this specific stretch of water has already been answered in previous replies.
351483,Jonny,2009-06-12 20:17:00,1380," Yeah, I didn't catch the extra pages first time around, but if the stretch of water was important to me I'd still be interested in what the MNR has to say, and maybe find out more about other stretches (if any) that are off-limits."
351489,justin elia,2009-06-12 20:29:00,151,Its not MNR's responsibility to know individual property ownership rights.  But it doesnt hurt to ask.  J
351491,fish_finder,2009-06-12 20:36:00,370,"I know its been answered now, but I'd thought I'd pop a couple of pointers in here......  1.  Its easy to ask permission......even if the land owners own the stream bed as well.  Most, including these folks are not going to get irate if you knock on their door and ask about fishing in the area.  It goes a long way, and in my experience it can really help in gaining access to some prime waters.  This river in particular, and one that probably shouldn't be discussed like this on such a large public forum IMO is one of very few in southern Ontario that actually have streambeds associated with the deeds.  Streambed ownership doesn't mean that folks won't let you fish there.  Many people who own land along streams have to clean up all the trash after rather ignorant ""fishers"".  Bill, I'm not at all saying that has anything to do with you.....just making a point there.  2.  I've had to deal with a few folks claiming to own the streambed in areas I knew they didn't.  The first time, I left and contacted a friend of mine, the late Grant Ferris,  who said to contact the MNR.  They weren't able to help at all, but instead instructed me to contact the land registry office for the area with the lot number, concession, etc......easy info to find if it means that much to you.  Then, find out from the L.R. folks if infact the streambed is included in the deed for that property.  If not, the next step is to contact the OPP, who deal with trespassing.  Let them know the situation.  When this happened to me on a particular stream I'd been fishing for over two decades, I got a copy of the deed along with a copy of the 'Heritage Hunting and Fishing Act'.  I stuffed those in the back of my vest in case the individual in question tried something again.  He did, I gave him the deed and the act.......hasn't bothered me since."
351493,ptmpete,2009-06-12 20:37:00,49,  How about a house on or near the prop you wish to fish?

351549,Rizzo,2009-06-13 00:34:00,4754,"I wonder why she wouldn't just laminate the proof, and post it on on a pole near where people access her property. Save her the trouble of people coming onto her property, and then arguing with her that she doesn't own the riverbed. Maybe it doesn't happen often enough to worry about it."
351626,cram,2009-06-13 04:14:00,1733, Tough situation if you're a farmer with a creek that crosses though your property.   Tough for the folks in canoes heading down those creeks......wonder what the solution is.
351664,Musky or Specks,2009-06-13 13:24:00,2710,The solution is to limit access to livestock on a waterway. Fence them off except for a small enclosed area that extends into the river. Livestock access is a major contributer to erosion and pollution in our rivers. It is illegal to fence across a navigable body of water and I have cut fences down while canoeing in southern ontario. Make sur your wire cutters are insulated. Some idiot actually run electric cattle fencing acroos canoeable waterways.
351726,JohnF,2009-06-13 21:45:00,3494,Saw this in action today. While I was standing in the middle of the creek I heard some more atv's coming. They'd been rippin' 'n snortin' thru all afternoon. These two got up to the clearing and they stopped. The rest had just driven on through - some waving to us. I was a little concerned that these two had stopped behind my wife sitting on shore so I headed over that way. Turns out to be a couple on his'n hers quads and the guy explained that he'd been told it was okay to use this trail but when he saw us there he assumed it was our property and he just wanted to stop and ask if it was okay. He was very polite. Smart guy.  JF

If she did own the bed like she says and she has had problems in the past , WHy is the land not posted and a sign outlineing her ownership of the river bed clearly in view . If you had seen the sign Im sure you would have picked a different spot . Clearly she could see you and your dad were not some yahoos and were not gonna leave behind a pile of trash etc. , you didnt yell at her etc. etc. maybe she was just jealous seeing you and your dad out haveing a good time shareing together the outdoors and she was home all alone , but thats karma for ya , who wants to spend time with someone who has nothing better to do but harass two guys enjoying themselves and CAUSEING NO TROUBLE . ?????

I enjoy talking to the fisherman that come through (not many come down that far though) But I have had a few small problems from people fishing from shore when we are not there. I've had my shed broken into for lawn chairs to use, beer bottles and bait containers left around (breaking some bottle too), making fires along the shore (where my kids play) when I have a fire pit 20' away. With her place close to the hwy, they probably get more of this. I'm not trying to give her an excuse for being a jerk, but I understand why she might be like this.  If somebody came to me and asked to fish, I wouldn't say no. Just try asking."
351412,bushart,2009-06-12 14:25:00,2628,  All very true...I also recall another time back in the 70's when a buddy and myself headed into the Haliburton area with a cartopper and a tent hoping to find a lake shore to fish and camp----Don't recommend this cause any lake with a road to it was sewn up with cottages.  Anyway we finally were ready to give up when we saw a group of cottagers talking and I asked if they knew where we could go and pitch a tent and fish---well turns out one of them had a vacant lot just down the lake and he gave us the OK.  Guess the story is that approach has served us well over time.  Bushart
351416,Carp,2009-06-12 14:44:00,1488,"The fact that this old lady says she owns the river bed should be a tip off that she knows a bit about it and has been through this situation before. I would have politely asked her to call the Ministry of Natural  Resources and ask that a Conservation Officer be sent to investigate. She's probably called many times in the past and the CO's are sick of her moaning about her property rights.  A CO I know, now retired, told me only about 1% of all the riverbeds in Ontario are privately owned, mostly in southern Ontario. This is a guy who retired recently with about 35 years service under his belt. He handed out more fines than other CO's in his area, but was always fair with hunters and anglers.  Once, in my presence, he checked out a repeat complaint by an old lady that anglers were trespassing on her land. When he showed up, there was one guy standing in the water fishing, just a few metres downstream of a bridge that the road passed over. The CO looked, didn't see anything wrong and drove off. Investigation complete !!!  He was actually upset with this lady for wasting his time. Rightfully so. Didn't even bother talking to the lady who made the complaint since he had spoken to her numerous times in the past. Always the same Bull story.  She claims to own land under the river because she doesn't want anglers walking along the riverbank beside her property. From what I understood, it was only up to the high water mark that she actually owned, so most of the year, you could actually walk on dry land at the river's edge and not be on her property. She's obviously been informed that she can't ask people to leave unless she owns the river bed, so now she claims to own that as well in an effort to drive away anglers. The CO's are well informed and if she had the right to ask people to leave, they would make sure you knew you were trespassing.  Get the address or emergency # (small green road sign with white numbers) for both sides of the river (if possible) and go to the local land registry office or in some cases the planning department. Make sure you have the correct township/municipality and the correct road name. You may have to pay a fee for the info, but if you wish to fish a good stretch of river unmolested, it's well worth the hassle. Obviously, if the landowner does have rights to the river bed, you're limited to fishing from the road bridge and the edges of the river around the bridge. They can't chase you away from the government land around the bridge, although I've heard that many try that too. Some landowners like to fish themselves and try to scare away anglers to protect ""their"" fish."

There's only one bridge that crosses the river downstream of 6 before it flows into the Saugeen. I can tell you unequivocally that everything both upstream and down from that bridge including the streambed is privately owned.

351450,solopaddler,2009-06-12 17:58:00,8605," It's a nice piece of water. Just upstream is a small dam that always holds trout. I used to know someone who had access to fish it and it was always really good, caught some huge browns in there. The last time I was there I was hiking upstream climbing over some jumbled up broken pieces of concrete and jumped about 3' down onto another slab. Unfortunately I didn't notice the 4"" spike sticking straight up embedded in the concrete. Landed on it with my left foot, full force. It went right through the sole of my hip waders, through my foot then out the top. Painful isn't a strong enough adjective LOL! Nevertheless I was soooo close to the dam so I pulled my foot off the spike and hobbled the last 200yds to the spot and on the first cast nailed a 17"" brown. True story."

As we were stringing up the rods a nice white haired old lady comes walking around the corner.  I think nothing of it and say hello as she walks up to the car.  We were talking about the fishing and such yada yada yada when she informs me that she owns the property on the one side of the bridge.  I'm thinking that's cool, I'll make sure to not step foot on it and get into the water directly below the bridge as planned.  She then informs me that she also owns the riverbed.  This is where I just smile and continue lacing up the flyrod.  I get into the water and make my way up to a small run where my buddy Dave hooked a really nice bow in a few weeks ago.  Well I'm in the middle of my first drift when from behind me I hear the old lady again ""You are trespassing, this is private property!""  I looked at her and said ""your property is on the other side of the bridge correct?""  she says yes, but still continues on.  Meanwhile I hook into a friggin monster rainbow, which is making the little ultralight beg for forgiveness and is peeling the 4lb test off the Shimano like it was going out of style.  I eventually lost the fish after about 5mins or so, not making headway on it once, lol.   I was then being threatened with a fine, and this is what set me off.  I informed her that she couldn't 'fine' me anything and if she thought I did deserve a ticket to call the police, bring your deed which states you own the riverbed and I'll gladly leave.  She then tells me she doesn't have to show me anything, lol.  I can see my dad is about to blow his fuse, so we just wrap things up and make our way to the car.  She even used the reference of ""How would you like it if I camped on your front lawn""... I gave her the what the hell look and said when was the last time she parked a lounge chair in the middle of the river?   This isn't waterfront property, if you've seen the Rocky you know exactly what I'm talking about.  I also didn't step foot on her 'land' as I made my way upstream (All of 10ft mind you) via the river itself.  I would really like to find out if she owns the riverbed or not..  If she does, then she had every right to ask me to leave, but from what I've been told it's a rarity that ownership proceeds past the high water mark.  Do I need to call the township? Would they possibly have this information?  I guess I just need to look at a land survey correct?"
351224,dnb_cbr,2009-06-11 23:23:00,61,"Im not sure about the Rocky, but i do know that some old deeds do include riverbeds.   The upper Credit near belfountain has some privately owned riverbeds, and i believe mabey a few properties in Hockley may as well."

351253,dave524,2009-06-12 00:22:00,4508,Is this a navigable waterway ?
351256,JohnF,2009-06-12 00:29:00,3494," I've tried to make this point before. A lot of folks don't distinguish between navigable and non-navigable waterways, but then I think there's enuf confusion as to the definition of navigable in this context given modern conditions and methods of transport to make it a tricky point to apply.  JF"
351262,JohnF,2009-06-12 00:42:00,3494,"Here's a for-instance. How many of you have heard of the old towpath allowance? This was a narrow band of shoreline that was kept open for the horses drawing barges along a navigable waterway. The problem now is that obviously no one uses horses to pull barges these days. They seldom even use barges other than in the largest waterways. So is that towpath still necessary? Should there be public access along a shoreline of any navigable waterway? We have a battle over that going on in our park area. Periodically some landowners along the river block off the public pathway that has been used by walkers for years. Then the fuss starts. I don't think the municipality knows how to apply the archaic laws that really don't make sense any longer but are still in existance.  Should a waterway that rises from a spring on a private property be considered a navigable waterway just because a small canoe or kayak can get up it? It goes nowhere and is of no value to commerce or meaningful travel. As much as I'd like to see fishermen have access to these fishing opps I can understand why a landowner might feel he has a claim to the riverbed. It's probably counted as part of the land he owns and taxed accordingly.  Different situation for two properties on opposing shores of a river passing through and past their property boundaries, or a substantial navigable waterway passing through a private property. Then it should not be private and closed.  YMMV.  JF"
351270,backbay,2009-06-12 01:04:00,773,"If you're in the water, you're not trespassing. It is possible that she owns the shoreline, but a bridge adjoining her property would probably result in an easement that you can legally use to access the water.

351271,BillM,2009-06-12 01:06:00,17367," Well there is a provincial canoe route right through this spot, so I would assume it is considered navigable.  BB: She had no issue with me walking down besides the bridge, it's when I waded upstream she started to go off..  BTW, Welcome to OFC"

351287,dave524,2009-06-12 01:42:00,4508," Thanks for the welcome, the published canoe route is a pretty clear cut , sometimes I think the "" I'm standing in the water and you can't touch me "" mentality goes too far at times. I am only familiar with the Rocky from a few trips in the 70's when we used to take the varmint rifles up that way on the weekend for a Saturday of groundhog shooting and then we hit it on Sunday where it crossed the Markdale Road for a dinner of pansize Brookies .

You have to go to the land registry office with her address, and or legal description.  You can then pull the deed for a fee.  Its a very hard thing to prove, I would do the homework before going up again.  Some land owners do own riverbed, and unfortunately we as anglers have to respect that.  I would say that if the police did come, they would slap you with a fine and you would have to fight it.  Guilty until proven innocent in this case.  Its funny, everyone knows places on rivers where land owners claim to own riverbed and come out shouting at you when you're fishing saying that you're tresspassing.  At the same time, you never hear of anyone getting a ticket, or a fine.  Wouldn't you think that if a few people got fined for tresspassing, word would spread like wildfire and no one would even think of tresspassing on that land anymore?  Makes you think, do they really own the riverbed, because if they did, why come out, just call the cops and let them sort it out.  J"

351377,bushart,2009-06-12 12:16:00,2628,"1st point:  I'm under the belief that the landowner must own both sides of the river to claim any riverbed ownership and if it's navigible it gets harder---what is she gonna do if your fishing ""Her"" water from a canoe--nicely suspended 3 feet above her riverbed??  2nd point:  It truly is a shame when people wish to lock up the land and waters along with the fish and game.(Maybe in this instance we can learn from our first nations about sharing these items with each other) BUT people have proven to be pigs and landowners get upset to come down to said riverbank to find empty beercases-smashed bottles--tin cans--broken fences etc etc etc.  3rd & last  In my early 20's a friend and myself found a country road outside of Dunville and found our way down to the Grand River--we set out our lines and it was'nt long a man and his bear sized german shephard arrived and notified us we were on private prop.  My friend and I apologized for not knowing and we asked where we could fish---well I guess he thought we were harmless and polite and he said ok right here---he was just keeping tabs to ensure his prop was not going to become a dump---too bad most of these stories did'nt end like this--we were always allowed access after that. (Nice old guy) But there's also the story where we were fishing the lower stretches of Bronte at night and watched a group of brain surgeons light a 30 ft pine completely on fire...  Bushart"

351402,BillM,2009-06-12 13:48:00,17367,"I'm not about to park myself there again until I know for sure.  I'm not out to make any enemies and she did apologize to my dad as we were leaving.  I think it's just a case of her assuming she owns the riverbed, nothing more.  I'll do some research and let you guys know if anything comes of it."
351404,bigbuck,2009-06-12 13:54:00,2449,"There is no need to be impolite or to lose your temper. Just inform the irate landowner to go back to his or her home and to please call the police, IF they arrive, you can let them know that you have been harassed by the landowner and are wondering if you can press charges. You are fishing on a navigable waterway which is considered Crown Land, if there is no Crown on the irate landowners head then you should be fine. But for God's sake, be polite, being nasty makes all fishermen look bad. Chances are, you are dealing with a grumpy old woman and who knows what her problem with the world is, and really, who cares........."
