351098,anders,2009-06-11 17:03:00,1168,NHL.com and tsn.ca polls both have the pens up roughly 55%.  Whats the OFC.com stance on the game winner?
351103,JohnF,2009-06-11 17:18:00,3494,My heart says Pens but my head says Wings.  JF
351105,Roy,2009-06-11 17:22:00,13728,HMMMM   results say 4-1 Wings. Stoty must have 4 IP addies.
351113,rob v,2009-06-11 17:41:00,535,whoever scores the most goals.
351116,Fang,2009-06-11 18:01:00,1330,doing the same as John. Betting heavy on Detroit but I hope I loose!!  I figure the only real way Pens can win is if I bet. I never win!!!
351129,K_F,2009-06-11 18:33:00,107,although sid and geno didnt look very ofensively effective in game 6 i say they turn it on for 7  pens win 4-2
351144,JohnF,2009-06-11 19:28:00,3494," Staal, Kennedy et al might turn out to be the key. Guerin has had some good moments too. If they can either draw some of the attention from the other two or just step up when they don't have Zetterberg and friends checking them, then the Pens might do it. But Crosby and Malkin have gotta do their thing right. Detroit won't know who to check. Of course that presupposes the Pens' defence & Fleury keep the rest of the Wings at bay. I hope both teams are at the top of their game in every position cuz then this could be one for the ages. I'm really looking forward to it.  JF"
351148,mistyriver1,2009-06-11 19:38:00,600,I'm routing for Pittsburgh but I bet three rounds ago that Detroit was gonna win the cup.  I hate the Dead Things though.

351176,Guest skeeter99,2009-06-11 21:28:00,0,statisticaly since 1934  14 game 7's have been played for the stanely cup  12 of the  14 were won by the home team  on average as of 08:50 of the second period the score was the final outcome of the game  so saying that the wings will win and quit watching halfway through the second and get some sleep so you are fresh at work LOL!!!!  so if you are a betting man put a 100 on detroit  and if you are a real betting man putt 300 on pittsburgh  LOL!!!

351337,Stoty,2009-06-12 03:54:00,2910,"I love how everyone remembers what I say....lol I'm still sticking to my guns....I cant see Pittsburgh beating Detroit at home in Game 7. I just hope it's a hell of a game, and not a crappy goal that wins it (either way)."
