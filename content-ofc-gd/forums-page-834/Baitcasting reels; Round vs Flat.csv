349537,krawler,2009-06-08 09:53:00,167,"Buying my first reel, when would i use a flat vs a round?  Would like to buy a multipurpose reel.  I mainly cast and retrieve spoons, stickbaits or spinners for pike or bass.  thanks"
349538,Jer,2009-06-08 10:06:00,1426,"Whichever feels more comfy. Round reels tend to hold more line, but not always."
349540,bigugli,2009-06-08 10:30:00,6138,I like the low profile reel because it fits comfortably in my hand.
349552,Garry2Rs,2009-06-08 11:21:00,1425,"Round reels generally have lower gear ratios IE 5.3 to 1.  They are better for big, or deep diving baits. Low profile reels normally have higher speed gears IE 6.3 to 1,  to bulge spinnerbaits and pick up line faster etc."
349558,spinnerbaitking,2009-06-08 11:46:00,1622,"Strickly personal I have both and use them equally, but really like my Calcutta 151 & Curado, alot of reels come in low & hi speed reteives, ask a buddy to try one, or at the bait shop, Angling Outfitters in Woodstock will let you take one out side to try it Richard"

350925,holdfast,2009-06-11 01:58:00,1813,"Oh Boy.  Im going to watch TV.  Ah Shucks, this is a good Question.  Might be interesting"
350981,Rich,2009-06-11 04:58:00,3927,I'd say for your first baitcaster it should be low profile. Just a more comfortable fit which will allow you to learn the finer points of baitcasting without developing wrist issues. lol
351585,splashhopper,2009-06-13 02:27:00,2931,i am looking at buying one too ( fathers day gift ?) and was wondering:  which style handles the lighter vs heavier lures ?  ( ie musky lures vs bass lures)  thanks  splashhopper
