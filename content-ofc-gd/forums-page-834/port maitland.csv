351037,Marko,2009-06-11 13:57:00,854,There are some monster carp in there. Chum the area good and throw a hook in there with some corn on it. You`ll be surprised how big they get and how hard they fight
351119,hammercarp,2009-06-11 18:07:00,964,They are getting perch on minnows there. But for great fun take marko's advice. Here's a Portmaitland carp from Sun. June 7 It was 16 lbs. 
351177,n8tivebigguy,2009-06-11 21:42:00,30,Hey thanks for all the suggestions. I will have to try out chumming and the corn. Thats a really nice size carp you have there hammercarp!
351379,Fish4Eyes,2009-06-12 12:23:00,1022,"Try chicken liver for the cats as well, and leave it out to roast in the sun so it gets more stinky. The big girls may still be kicking around. But if your after size, target the carp this time of year."
351625,n8tivebigguy,2009-06-13 04:03:00,30,"I've been having alot of luck catching some cats and big carp around here up river on the grand. Two weeks ago i caught a pretty big carp and it was 34""-22lbs. I tried to take a pic with my phone but they don't have a flash for night time."
