This type of fishing is just like everyone says, look for the boat fleet, and the fish is there. Everyone was getting a lot of fish and I believe the lures we were using are too big.  What sizes of Rapala jiggin rap, William Ice spoon and bad boy jigs do you guys usually use for 80 FOW?   80FOW fin flipped Whitie 4.6lb "

I noticed that the whities picked the spoons off the bottom, make sure you give it a decent pause and are hitting bottom every time."
