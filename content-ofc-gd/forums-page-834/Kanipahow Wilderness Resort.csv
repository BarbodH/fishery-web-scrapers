Anyhow I've been considering them for a couple years now as I'm sure the fishing is decent but have shied away because of the price. (Yes I'm cheap.  ) I almost booked their Embarass lake camp for this year then managed to get a booking at another fly in outpost in the same area for $200 less per man...  So that's it, not much info. I'd personally like to know how you make out if you decide to go."

Just asking, because we have flown with a guy out of Wawa for years, used to be based in Chapleau.  Their site is www.outpostcamps.com.  Good people, love their Ribes lake, and Anjigaming is good too, and their prices are great, $695 for the week.  If anyone knows anymore about midnorth/kanipahow it would be appreciated.  Hope we made a good choice for the change of scenerie."
