All the old shows from the 60's from the Beverly Hillbilly's to The Munsters and Petticoat Junction. Old movies from the 50's and 60's. I watched Jason and the Argonauts last night with zero commercials. 70's era music videos that will make you just howl. Most I have never seen like the 1 hit wonder ""Kung Fu Fighting"" The guy is on a small platform doing the same karate move for the entire song surrounded by 6 kids that stare at him for the entire song stiff as manikins. Kung Fu and The 6 Million Dollar Man is on regularly. The Andy Griffin Show is on as I type. Occasionally there is the local Town Council's on for the area. CFTV on Channel 586 on The Bell Sat TV.  I highly recommend it, especially for us old Boomers."
