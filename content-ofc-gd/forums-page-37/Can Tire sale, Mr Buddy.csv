1053195,Headhunter,2019-11-28 17:01:00,5703,And they have boot cleats for $9.99! HH
1053197,lew,2019-11-28 17:46:00,12766,I drove down the the Peterboro store for the 7:00 opening this morning and there were about 9 bazillion people ahead of me when the door opened. Everybody got in quick though and I knew exactly what I wanted and where it was and I was out the door again in 15 minutes. A few minutes of utter pandemonium but I saved myself $250 so it was worth the craziness LOL
1053198,canoecarrier,2019-11-28 17:57:00,54,"Stay away from buddy heaters, I've had a couple over the years and nothing but problems with them. I've had several days that they won't work in the cold around -25 even after keeping them in the house with the tank before leaving to the lake. The one I have now is possessed and the flame some times bursts up and looks like its about to explode. Never again!!!"
1053202,Terry,2019-11-28 18:37:00,14456,I bought one 15 years ago and just last year I bought a new one but still have not used it cause the old one just keeps working and some people here will tell you IÂ am hard on all my equipment so two thumbs up from me
1053205,Dutch01,2019-11-28 20:44:00,1431,"I have 3 and all work great, no problems here. Some people have problems using 5# tanks, again no problem here. Key is to use the right hose AND aÂ propane filter. Â Also, always turn off the propane first and let the heaterÂ run out, that way there's no gas still in the hose (which can degrade the rubber if you don't have the right hose). Finally if it doesn't want to start/stay running hold the dial down for 30 seconds after starting the pilot until it warms up a bit."
1053207,DRIFTER_016,2019-11-28 21:06:00,10439,"Haven't had any issues with mine, but I don't use it ice fishing as it's not big enough. I use a sunflower heater when ice fishing. The Buddy I bought to use in my popup camper in the fall in Alaska. A lot better than the forced air one my camper came with. I also run it on a 5# or 20# tank."
1053209,misfish,2019-11-28 21:13:00,29133,"This guy can look at something ,and it will break.  One have owned one heater, Always worked except for my own fault. Melted a piece of plastic on the flue. Cleaned and fired right up. I use mine all the time and it is on high. I like my sauna. I also only use the green bottles. Which reminds me,need to stock up."
1053210,irishfield,2019-11-28 22:20:00,26272,Oh.. this one must have been Paul's... Seems we tear at least one apart every Winter! 
1053219,Chuck Enwinde,2019-11-29 07:14:00,247,I've had two repair jobs that got just about as far as that picture before I twisted the aluminum hose trying to get the brass fitting off.Â  Â Both ended up in the bin.Â  Maybe I should have looked around for an air plane mechanic.
1053225,irishfield,2019-11-29 15:34:00,26272,"LOL.. did you need any screws, we seem to have a few extras!"
1053234,AKRISONER,2019-11-29 17:41:00,5558,"myself, and my two best friends that I fish with all use Buddy heaters with propane hoses that we ordered off of amazon hooked up to barbecue propane tanks. We all have never had any issues over the past 4 years. My only complaint about my little buddy heater is that the cage has a nack for popping off when its being towed in the sled."
1053249,FILTHY OAR,2019-11-29 20:58:00,65,"LMAO, prob just don't know how to use it. Six yr's and still going strong."
1053253,misfish,2019-11-29 22:18:00,29133,Take up walking out. Never happens. ðŸ˜‹
1053261,canoecarrier,2019-11-30 02:07:00,54,"How could you not know how to use it ? lol! I've taken 2 apart that didn't work. They haven't been very reliable, in the cold."
1053264,LeXXington,2019-11-30 03:26:00,1928,"LOL, I still remember you guys starting that up and the flames shooting out until you fixed the issue. Worked great for a few more seasons after that"
1053265,DRIFTER_016,2019-11-30 03:58:00,10439,I took mine apart before I ever fired it up. I did the thermocouple hack and the wind screen hack.
1053324,DanD,2019-12-02 12:05:00,2223,"Stock up? I have 10 or 12 bottles that I have been refilling. $20.00 for a 3 pack at Crappy; I can refill 3 bottles for a little under $3.00. I have never had an issue with ""dirty"" propane affecting my Buddy?Â Even though we cannot buy theÂ fill adapters here at the stores; you can get them off of Amazon for around $10.00. I made my own with a parts from different units that has a hose between to supply tank and the bottle. That way I can place the bottle on a scale and stop filling it when it reaches approx 70%."
1053337,David Chong,2019-12-02 20:46:00,836,"I have had the same experience, my original one is about 12 years old and I bought a new one on sale and it's still in the box! LOL"
1053339,misfish,2019-12-02 21:36:00,29133,I carry a top burner as a spare just in case. Takes up no space. I get greenies for $4:45
1053341,Old Man,2019-12-02 22:09:00,822,Mine started to act up. Wouldnâ€™t stay lit. WatchedÂ this Youtube video and did the same. It works great now.Â https://youtu.be/8CqW0HT_7VQ
1053347,irishfield,2019-12-02 23:25:00,26272,"Every trip into Wally Mart, CTC, Home Hardware these days they seem to be $7 a tin... when you can refill them for a BUCK ! IF you want to start Brian, I have a couple dozen empties here, I grab them from the PPark every Fall for the boys, leftÂ by the ""green conscious"" campers that leave themÂ behind andÂ the park absolutely hates them! I still use my 20 lb'r and a sunflower, but I now carry a top burner and 1lb'rs to take the frost off quick and cook lunch. The ""boys"" use at least 2 tanks a day x our 10 day trips... $20 vs $100+ !"
1053380,FILTHY OAR,2019-12-03 16:33:00,65,"It was sarcasim, sorry thought you could read right through that."
1053411,KawarthaAngler,2019-12-04 12:29:00,273, I walked into the Ptb store after work (approx 4:30pm) and picked up the Buddy heater and a couple other 1/2 price sale items.Â  No problem with inventory.
1053555,Jon,2019-12-09 20:17:00,209,"Rona has them on clearance for $72. Not in stock everywhere, though.  Jon"
