1053482,gordy28,2019-12-06 15:37:00,638,I will be the first to admit that I am not a walleye specialist and definitely not an expert Over a bunch of trips i have gotten to a place where I have 5 confidence baits that I would be pretty comfortable as my only lures (caveat would want different colors and backups lol) This is a far cry for our first trips where we brought everything but the kitchen sink Blog is up now at northernjacks.com Cheers Andrew
1053483,Headhunter,2019-12-06 16:03:00,5703,I would add a deep diving crank bait. HH
1053485,gordy28,2019-12-06 16:37:00,638,Thanks HH For me I have always found that If I need a crank to run deeper than what I can get a hot n tot to go I shift to the worm harness/bottom bouncer call out But yes - If I allowed myself a 6th either a rapala tail dancer or rapala minnow rap would be there for sure Andrew 
1053490,OhioFisherman,2019-12-06 17:42:00,6623,"We used to use hot n tots and wiggle warts here on Lake Erie for walleye in the late 70's and 80's, the hot n tots of that era had a tendency for the bill to break loose from the body and the body would start taking on water, no problems with newer versions? Both would get down in the 20 foot range long line trolling with 8# test line. Chrome and black, gold and black were the best colors here. we stopped using the hot n tots because of the bill issues bandit 200's worked as well at times. I don't have a go to list for Ontario, what they wanted seemed hit and miss up there."
1053494,Headhunter,2019-12-06 18:53:00,5703,"Used to use HotnTot on Quinte in the 90's on sunny days, blue and silver. Typically, if I am using a deep diving crank, I am using it to find active fish. I don't want to slow down to run blades, so I rarely use them. I also find that blades can attract too may non targeted fish. HH"
1053508,BillM,2019-12-07 06:23:00,17367,The only walleye bait I've used on my last 2 fly-ins are vertical jigging spoons.  I brought about half a dozen of them.    Later in the fall they're deadly and sometimes the only thing they'll bite.  Full sized Williams and the Bluefox rattlin spoons work great.   No need to bring 500lbs of jigs with you.
1053509,Garnet,2019-12-07 15:40:00,2056,What color of black bucktail are you using.
1053517,Musky Plug,2019-12-07 21:23:00,398,"I like to use jigging raps size 7, bucktail jigs, smaller swimbaits and stick baits."
1053522,limeyangler,2019-12-08 06:06:00,5204,"Jig and a minnow, all’s ya need."
1053525,Big Cliff,2019-12-08 11:28:00,6899,"Tea stained lake, lots of weeds:  3/8 oz pink jig head, white twister tail = A boat full of walleye and pike"
1053528,misfish,2019-12-08 18:51:00,29133,Do not let tea stain lakes  fool ya. Many options color wise. I like black body/chartreuse tail twisters.
1053549,Old Ironmaker,2019-12-09 18:00:00,8243,We still use Hot N Tots on the lower Grand for Pics. I like the versatility as you can bend the lip to get about 15' down. My go to when all else fails is a bottom bouncing Lindy Rig. Usually tipped with a Leech imitation. I would never leave home without a good old fashion Black and metal flake Silver floating Rappala.
1053553,gordy28,2019-12-09 19:03:00,638,For sure Simon  - most of our trips are done end of August though and we have found minnows hard to come by (and tough to keep alive when we have had them) - hoping we can get them for our 2020 trip - my personal best walleye was on a jig and a minnow
