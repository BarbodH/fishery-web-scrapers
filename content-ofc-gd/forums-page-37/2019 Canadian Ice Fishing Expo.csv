1052239,Old Ironmaker,2019-11-11 20:09:00,8243,"Pick me up on the way big guy please. It sure sounds likeÂ  great time. It might get me fired up enough to hit the hardwater this year. Went to Nipp mid week last January and even though we only got 2 keepers amongst the 6 of us we had a blast and drank and ate like Royalty. I brought 6 big Erie Pics from the freezer for a fish fry on the ice and fed the young couple in the ice bungalow next to us. And for a laugh I fried up some dead shiners as an appetizer. And Big Janko ate a handful, he is a handful himself!!!!Wanted to race a CO for sled ownerships. I promised the CO he wasn't driving anything that day. Some times ice fishing has nothing at all to do with dropping a line down a hole."
1052247,David Chong,2019-11-11 21:59:00,836,"I haven't seen the actual premises but apparently there is more room and yes, the parking is FREE!"
1052249,misfish,2019-11-11 22:22:00,29133,You know the granddaughter is going to want another picture taken David.
