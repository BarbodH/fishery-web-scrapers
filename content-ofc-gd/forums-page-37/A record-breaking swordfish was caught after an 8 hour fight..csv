1053024,glen,2019-11-25 12:37:00,2641,Great to see big fish being caught.
1053034,AKRISONER,2019-11-25 15:32:00,5558,nice catch...but i dont know who in the hell would want to eat that thing unless you are into lead poisoning and cancer.  Could you imagine the level of biomagnification goin on in a predatory fish that size. Yeeesh

1053069,Toronto_Angler,2019-11-26 00:44:00,698,Love that show. I love saltwater fish. i know swordfish and Tuna are full of mercury but damn they taste good. Everything in moderation I guess
