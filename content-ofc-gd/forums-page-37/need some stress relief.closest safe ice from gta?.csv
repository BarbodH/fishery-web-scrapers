Been really stressedÂ out which is why I havent fished either.Â  Need to get back into the groove.Â  Looking for some safe ice close to gta.Â  have a hut, auger and everything else required.Â  Just need safe ice and hopefully some fish!Â ðŸ¤£ Looking somewhere with easy access on to the ice. Thanks for your recommendations!"

1052989,misfish,2019-11-24 16:39:00,29133,Lots of open river to fish still. January 1st is ice time.
1052990,Terry,2019-11-24 16:54:00,14456,Oh. Perch and crappie will be calling your name long before then Â Lol
1052993,Tjames09,2019-11-24 17:12:00,664,"Any ice that did form in the Kawarthas melted this week with 6* weather and rain. Theres no ice anywhere near me, and I'm surrounded by lakes. Lots of open water right now. Its only November. You could probably shore fish for pan fish (just remember lots of rivers are sanctuaries in November.)"
