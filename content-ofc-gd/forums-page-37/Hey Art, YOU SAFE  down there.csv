1053808,aplumma,2019-12-17 13:02:00,6896,The good news is so far it is just rain. We are in the low 30's and the forecast says we are far enough South to avoid a winter mix. The scary ones are when they come from up North with the cold and snow. I just have to say that people down here do not take driving and snow seriously enough so we get quite the bad show of drivers. Thanks for checking on me Brian Art
