Everything you need for your ice fishing season is there. And to keep with the spirit, we had ice pellets and snow this morning and still falling. And of course,granddaughter got here pic with David. It was funny. Walked by the HT booth and no David. Oh no. She was looking and looking. We walked around and made our way back to the booth. There he was and she went running. LOL Thanks again David for making her morning . Great seeing a bunch of ice hound fellas again this morning.  After the show,it was a quick trip to Cabelas for the Santa visit. "

I thought it was a pretty good show, saw some new things, won a $10.00 Cabella's gift card and a really nice shirt, got a really good deal on a GPS for my son-in law for Christmas and checked out a couple of outfitters. All in all A nice way to spend a few hours."
