1053269,John Bacon,2019-11-30 18:06:00,3277,Bombardier purchased OMC in 2001.  BRP was spun off from Bombardier in 2003. 
1053325,Garnet,2019-12-02 12:30:00,2056,"Mmm nice to know wonder what was going on in 2007. I don't follow BDR just they have a very checkered financial history. Mercury XRI XR6 no parts available.  This is for Goose""I have a buddy sent his computer for XRI to states for $800 re program"" It worked."
1053328,Lape0019,2019-12-02 15:05:00,647,"I have a 225HO G2 at the moment and havent had any issues with it. My honest opinion is every brand has a bad motor here and there. The ETEC has proven to be pretty good overall. Especially in that horsepower range. I would be more concerned with if you have a dealer close by to service it and if they have a good reputation. They will all break sooner or later. My advice would be to ask to see service and maintenance invoices for the motor to ensure it has been taken care of as well as to see if there were any major repairs. Secondly, bring it to a dealer and have them do the proper tests to ensure it is still in good condition and see if they can tell you how many hours are on it.  "
1053400,Musky Plug,2019-12-04 00:34:00,398,"There are two Evinrude dealers within driving distance. Both have a fairly decent rep. One is currently where I take my boat now. I understand that everything has a life expectancy. Would like to do my part to make sure it lasts as long as it can. I doubt I would be able to get any maintenance records.  I did go and view the boat over the weekend. He sounded like he knew about the motor fairly well. Motor was turned on and run sounded ok. I was told that there has never been any major work done to the motor, only small things. He said the ""small"" things he did but the other jobs it was taken to a mechanic near his cottage for service. So I'm opting to have it looked at for an engine diagnostic. As well as a once over for other boat things that were missed."
1053407,Garnet,2019-12-04 11:37:00,2056,That's just a little CSI have good look at head bolts another major bolts under cowl. You can't put wrench on bolts without leaving marks. Listen to the story and look for proof.
1053429,Bernie,2019-12-05 00:27:00,3190,"I have been more than pleased with my Evinrude.  	It's a 2001 175 Ficht under Bombardiers name. 	Very little maintenance, good on fuel and very reliable.  	I'd buy another when the time comes."
1053516,Musky Plug,2019-12-07 21:18:00,398,"Thank you everyone who gave some input. I did end up buying the boat with the 90hp Evinrude Etec. I did have it looked at buy a Evinrude dealer and I was told overall the boat and motor are in good condition considering the age. The only thing that needs to be replaced is the impeller as it is original, other than that everything was good. This is the report from the dealer, if there's anything else I should know, please let me know. Thanks  "
1053524,Garnet,2019-12-08 11:01:00,2056,If possible get the impeller done threw winter or do yourself not a big job.
1053526,captpierre,2019-12-08 16:40:00,2521,Kind of neglectful to have never changed the impeller.  Good thing he didn’t have to change oil/filter. Hope he looked after lower unit.
1053527,OhioFisherman,2019-12-08 17:37:00,6623,"Ya, if you wait until spring it might take until summer?"
1053529,misfish,2019-12-08 20:00:00,29133,"Ah, that's better. Save on the neck strain.LOL  Enjoy the new ride.   "
1053531,Musky Plug,2019-12-08 20:11:00,398,LOL. Thanks! I will forsure.
1053532,Musky Plug,2019-12-08 20:15:00,398,"Yes, I thought so but the place that I brought it said that it wasn't that big a job. The lower unit was also looked at, I was told that all was good with it."
1053543,AKRISONER,2019-12-09 14:16:00,5558,"People go a little crazy about impellers. It really depends on the types of lakes you run the boat in when talking about when to change it. If you fish the kawarthas you need to be changing that thing regularly. If you mainly fish open water on the shield  Lakes you can definitely push replacement intervals out a little longer. The rubber does degrade over time so eventually they need to be changed, but in general if you are fishing clear rocky lakes and not running your motor through the junk, rice, grass, slop and mud like on the kawarthas all of the time you should be good to go."
1053544,Lape0019,2019-12-09 15:08:00,647,"Congrats ont he purchase. From what I understand of the paperwork, looks like a pretty decent purchase. An impeller is very little cost and it doesn't look like there were any high temp codes popped so it isn't like it needed a new one. Now that you have it though, may as well change it out for piece of mind."
1053545,AKRISONER,2019-12-09 15:30:00,5558,definitely take the time to learn to replace your impeller. If you are handy at all you can figure it out and the winter is the best time to learn! I learned how to do mine on youtube!
1053547,Fisherman,2019-12-09 16:40:00,7201,"Haha, if it isn't on youtube, it's never been done."
1053111,Musky Plug,2019-11-27 00:33:00,398,"Hey all, Looking at a boat with an 90hp Evinrude Etec. Does anyone own one or have any experience with these motors? I have read very mixed reviews online regarding these motors and have no experience with them personally. Would be used for mainly driving but also from trolling. Any help would be greatly appreciated."
1053116,Yellow Fever,2019-11-27 11:46:00,139,"What year?....i have 2 on my boat a 250 with 765 hours on it, I have had some issues with it but it gets used and my kicker which is a 15, and it has 2000 hours on it. They are the 2010 year. The new G2 are excellent. I do like the motors."
1053130,AKRISONER,2019-11-27 14:56:00,5558,"Family friend has an e tech and has had electrical issues with it. We owned a 94 Johnson v4 and it also died due to consistent electrical problems, it’s somewhat more irrelevant though because it’s not the same motor, just the same company. Their reliability from personal experience and those of my friends that use evinrude, mercury, yamaha, Honda and suzuki I would rank them last in reliability. Performance is good though."
1053137,Musky Plug,2019-11-27 16:30:00,398,"It’s a 2005 motor. Unsure about the amount of hours on it. Would it be a bad idea to troll with a 2 stroke motor of that size?  Yes, been reading a lot about the motors. Some good some bad. The reviews seem to be mostly one sided but then again you will hear more bad then good."
1053140,OhioFisherman,2019-11-27 16:52:00,6623,What engine was causing all the problems for OMC years ago?
1053142,DRIFTER_016,2019-11-27 17:49:00,10439,I think it was the oil injection on their V4 models back in the day.
1053143,Musky Plug,2019-11-27 18:17:00,398," I believe those were the Fict or Ficht motors? The were made until the early 2000’s, then BRP bought the company. The one that is on the boat I’m looking at is a BRP motor."
1053145,muskymatt,2019-11-27 19:36:00,2608,I have a 115 etec and it has been awesome. This year I had an injector fail that cast me $400 but part was easily accessible and was fixed quick.  Other than that it has performed amazingly since i put it on in 2011. It will troll down to  1.8mph without a sock and purrs like a kitten. I have a 9.9 kicker I use just to keep the hours off the 115. Quiet and a great hole shot. Love my etec and gas mileage is excellent. 
1053146,muskymatt,2019-11-27 19:38:00,2608,It was the pre 2008 ficht 150hp and up. After market upgrade solved the issue. 
1053147,BassMan11,2019-11-27 19:44:00,583,"I have a 2009 Etec 75 tiller (pretty much the same as the 90). It has been great for me for the last 4 years as the second owner. That said I am also very easy on it spending my time on a lot of smaller lakes. I have 0 complaints thus far and really like the motor. Lots of power, quiet, fuel efficient. But I am sure there are also lemons out there!"
1053151,Rustic-Fisher,2019-11-27 20:49:00,826,I’ve got a 2017 90hp on my 1650 Rebel Love it so far ! Hole shot is great and can also attest to Amazing fuel consumption . Also love the self winterizing feature . Only 25hrs on it but no complaints . Buddies also run them with very few issues .
1053153,DRIFTER_016,2019-11-27 21:58:00,10439,My neighbour at the cabin bought a new Kingfisher 2025HT with a 200 Evinrude on it this summer. Nice boat and engine. Seems to run real nice and is quiet. Kind of smells like a diesel when it's idling along.
1053156,Musky Plug,2019-11-27 22:40:00,398,Does that mean the Evinrude motors that pre date 08 are Ficht motors? I believe this one has a BRP badge on it.
1053157,Musky Plug,2019-11-27 22:41:00,398,Have you trolled with the motor? if so how was the performance?
1053180,Yellow Fever,2019-11-28 11:48:00,139,"I would say ike any motor you could troll with it if you don't have a kicker, but your putting hours on your motor . As i mentioned i have a lot of hours on my big motor which i don't really understand, my typical day my motor gets run for 20 minutes and then my kicker runs for 6 hours yet i have 765 hours on it and 2000 on my 15 which doesnt add up. I have the NMEA cable to my 250 and can track my hours on my screen and with the motor off theclock stops? Doubt you will be disappointed."
1053181,John Bacon,2019-11-28 13:32:00,3277,Wasn't OMC long gone by 2008?  I think the major problems with the Ficht motors was more in the 90s.
1053182,muskymatt,2019-11-28 13:47:00,2608,"Yes I had my dates mixed up. From what I understand when OMC was taken over from BRP, which was due to the performance issues of the 150 and up Ficht, BRP redesigned the fuel system. I believe the fuel system was the reason they were catching fire. They scrapped the ficht,  came up with the next generation they called the etec and put in a similar fuel delivery system they designed for use in NASA'S rockets.    "
1053186,Garnet,2019-11-28 14:23:00,2056,Parts for older Etec not available. I know a guy that sold very nice bass boat because no Etec parts.
1053229,Therealgooseman,2019-11-29 17:12:00,7,"Have a 2017 Etech 90hp HO and absolutely love it, great on gas, amazing hole shot and I got a 10 year warranty so  piece of mind. I am not here to bash any other brands but I wouldn't give to much credit to the "" I have a friend"" or ""I know a guy with this engine"" type comments as usually those people dont have all the details on what the issues was and more importantly what caused it. My previous motor was a 1999 Johnson 50hp and that motor ran like a champ from the day I got it till the day I sold it... Hope this helps, any questions and you can PM me. Scott"
1053233,AKRISONER,2019-11-29 17:39:00,5558,I am only speaking from light experience because I have had to tow the guys home off of the lake lol. I absolutely dont know the specifics of the issues its none of my business but I do know ive towed them off of the lake 2 times in the past 6 years lol.
1053235,DRIFTER_016,2019-11-29 17:48:00,10439,I've had to be towed in twice now. It really sucks but both times it was not the engines fault. First time was water in the fuel after the unfortunate sinking incident and the second time it was a damaged seal on the connector for my auxillary tank that I have been running off while waiting for the last of the water to evaporate out of my main tank. 😒
1053247,Sinker,2019-11-29 19:35:00,8692,"I'm a yamaha guy through and through, but if I found a good deal on an etec, I'd take it. I have a few buddies who run them and love them.  S."
1053250,Musky Plug,2019-11-29 21:02:00,398,"Just asking for any information as none of my friends who have boats have Etec's. All are Yami or Merc. Thank you Scott, appreciate it. 👊  I called my local marine dealer. Told me they could get parts for the motor.."
1053251,Musky Plug,2019-11-29 21:05:00,398,"Thanks. Yes, I totally agree that the main shouldn't be used but a kicker isn't in the budget right now."
1053268,Garnet,2019-11-30 12:45:00,2056,Good piece of mind. If I remember correctly 2007 was when BDR took over OMC. Before Georges Soros Canadian investor and Roger Penske owned OMC in the late 90's. They bought a bunch of boat companies mostly a flop.
