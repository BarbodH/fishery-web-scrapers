1052980,Big Cliff,2019-11-24 14:56:00,6899,"Been cleaning up my hobby area and I have a bunch of old fishing tackle, most of it needs cleaning up/painting/new hooks stuff like that (a couple of items might even be antiques) but instead of just throwing it away I thought I would offer it for free to anyone interested in it.  I might even dig out a few more items between now and someone claiming it.  That's a large size freezer bag BTW not a sandwich bag"
1052986,Pikeslayer,2019-11-24 16:25:00,1443,Do you deliver? i would like these delivered ASAP!!!
1052988,Big Cliff,2019-11-24 16:32:00,6899,"For you my friend I sure would, Can I take you and MA out for dinner one evening this week?"
1052992,Pikeslayer,2019-11-24 17:05:00,1443,"Its a date. All kidding aside, the rod/reel combo would be a welcome addition to Sean’s collection. The assorted tackle should go to someone who can repurpose it. I have tons of tackle still in original packaging and I would like to see it going to someone who will actually use it. Lots of great karma in that tackle  "
1052998,Big Cliff,2019-11-24 20:07:00,6899,I'll bring the rod and reel with me when I come down on Saturday. I'll hold on to the tackle until I find a new home for it.

1053050,Big Cliff,2019-11-25 20:20:00,6899,I have no idea what's in there but there are a few pretty old ones.

A lady that spends her summers fishing with her grand kids was more than happy to have my leftovers and I even managed to throw in a few little extras for the kids. Guess it's true, ""one man's junk is another man's treasure""!"
1053383,Loonietoon,2019-12-03 16:51:00,1450,GREAT ON YOU CLIFF 👍😁
