1053395,SaugaPikeSlayer,2019-12-03 23:58:00,48,Has anyone ever fished the ship turning basin in the Toronto port lands? Looks like the grass is kept short and would be easy to walk around the edges or park a camping chair.  
1053399,John Bacon,2019-12-04 00:32:00,3277,I don't think that you're allowed to fish there. 
1053507,captpierre,2019-12-07 02:53:00,2521,I used to fish the eastern gap from the Wards Island shoreline. Caught a few decent pike. Fished the lagoon on the islands too. Bass and pike.
1053510,Garnet,2019-12-07 15:44:00,2056,I fished bass tournament there many years ago. From a boat with harbor licence (giant scam ) you can fish anywhere.
1053512,AKRISONER,2019-12-07 19:20:00,5558,The harbour license Toronto port authority thing is beyond bogus. It drives me insane
1053552,JoshS,2019-12-09 18:50:00,729,"I know it's off topic but the harbour licence thing bugs me! If you don't renew (because you don't need it that year), they hit you up for previous unpaid years' when you do renew. So I just stopped getting it and cross my fingers when out there. I used to go out more and still do a few times a year, have been for a decade and never was asked for it. But heard of harbour police asking others (probably just jinxed myself lol). I get the benefit of the quick training course to teach boaters the speed limits, restricted areas etc but still seems like a nice little cash grab. Re turning basin, don't think it's stacked with fish but I've heard of the odd fish caught there. It's a deeper basin. Give it a shot, this time of year might be some roaming pike in there. Bomb out a swimbait and see. Might be better off in other areas though."
