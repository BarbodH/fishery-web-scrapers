1053107,tomO,2019-11-27 00:08:00,363,Any one seen these propane powered out boards from Mercury? I don't know how to put a link on here.

1053110,misfish,2019-11-27 00:30:00,29133,"Make a 2hp or less that takes a 1lb bottle, I would be interested.LOL"
1053117,dave524,2019-11-27 13:03:00,4508,"I know there are a lot of regulations for a propane installation on a larger boat, just how much would apply to a 20 pound tank on a 12 foot tinner ? http://www.pcmarinesurveys.com/Safe Boat propane Installation.htm"
1053136,OhioFisherman,2019-11-27 16:19:00,6623,So a propane outboard would be a 4 stroke ( inboard also ). other than running slightly cleaner the advantage would be?
1053215,Jmeyer,2019-11-29 03:31:00,83,"Advantages I hear are they are clean, slightly quieter and better economy if not run full bore often. I'm surprised merc hasn't brought this to the table earlier considering tohatsu builds all their motors under 10hp and tohatsu has had them on the market for about 3 years now. I might try one of these for next year, I think it would work great for portaging being light and a small propane bottle would make things easier. Lehr makes nothing but propane outboards from 2- 9.9hp but mixed reviews."

1053240,Fisherman,2019-11-29 18:28:00,7201,"You can get these now to refill,  much cheaper south of the border.  https://www.homedepot.com/p/Flame-King-1-lb-Refillable-Propane-Cylinder-YSN164/305539511"
1053241,misfish,2019-11-29 19:01:00,29133,You can take these to Costco for fill up ?

1053248,Fisherman,2019-11-29 20:31:00,7201,"I don't think so,  you need this hose to refill from a 20lb tank unless they have it at Costco.  https://www.amazon.ca/MENSI-Pressure-Camping-Propane-Connection/dp/B07RJMPJ6H/ref=pd_sbs_86_t_1/133-7227364-7597206?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B07RJMPJ6H&pd_rd_r=753eb0a8-5d5a-4c3a-9b83-2c4aa8dc2718&pd_rd_w=ALE6Y&pd_rd_wg=WQoYT&pf_rd_p=9926bb69-42b9-46e4-b788-f665992e326d&pf_rd_r=BW721ARGWBD762TGBTJZ&psc=1&refRID=BW721ARGWBD762TGBTJZ"
1053257,John Bacon,2019-11-30 00:31:00,3277,How expensive is 5hp going to be on fuel even if you're paying a premium on the propane? 
1053258,Old Man,2019-11-30 00:57:00,822,I have one of these for refilling 1 pound containers from 20 lb tanks. The only problem is the amount of crap that can collect in the bottom of 20 lb tanks. I screwed up one catalytic heater because of this.  https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B06XWSRCC2/ref=sspa_dk_detail_3?psc=1&pd_rd_i=B06XWSRCC2&pd_rd_w=oeGk3&pf_rd_p=4b7c8c1c-293f-4b1e-a49a-8787dff31bcb&pd_rd_wg=vdyxx&pf_rd_r=FG0MCJ3TTNKJXJMM2V29&pd_rd_r=c0f0d66c-0c1a-43ca-9362-838fe8812522&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEyUU5YQUFIUllISkw4JmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwMjcxNTU2Q0JZWFgxV0xaUTBYJmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTAyODcwNDAyMjQxU1BRNFVQWk9PJndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfZGV0YWlsJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ==
1053259,John Bacon,2019-11-30 01:00:00,3277,Looks like a Tohatsu; they make small outboards for Mercury & Evinrude.  It has the same displacement and styling as the 4 to 6 hp Tohatsu motors.  	There's a lot of misinformation in the video.  Propane is not zero emissions.  It's a hydro-carbon and will produce CO2.  It's cleaner than gasoline; but completely polution free.
1053260,Fisherman,2019-11-30 01:49:00,7201,"It's a hydro-carbon and will produce CO2.  It's cleaner than gasoline; but completely polution free. I think you mean CO in addition to CO2 and think you're missing a ""not"" after the but."
1053266,John Bacon,2019-11-30 05:22:00,3277,"Yes, not completely polution free.  And it will produce CO too."
1053370,Big Cliff,2019-12-03 14:36:00,6899,"My son and I looked at the propane ones last year and after doing a lot of reading, research, and thinking it through we decided on the little Honda 2.3 air cooled. I have to say we are both really happy we went that route. there were a few reports of them being noisy but we didn't find them bad at all and the advantages were well worth any additional noise. On a scale of 1-10 I'd rate the little Honda a solid 10."

1053472,pics,2019-12-06 02:54:00,1268,I bought the Suzuki 2.5 four stroke - liquid cooled.. beautiful motor.. propane certainly has advantages but not enough to convince me..
1053492,maker a laker,2019-12-06 18:26:00,33,"Guys, A few things to keep in mind: Questions for Members I look forward to some numbers for comparison."
1053506,misfish,2019-12-07 02:31:00,29133,"My thinking on the 1 lb propane bottle was , if they can make a gas auger , now run on propane, why not a small out board that can do the same. I know I am thinking only me and my toon, but I am sure it is possible.  I know it,s CC,s and not HP."
1053520,John Bacon,2019-12-08 01:15:00,3277,I don't think that there's much difference in weight.  The 5hp Mercury (Tohatsu?) propane motor weighs 59.5 lbs vs. 57 lbs for the 5hp gas motor.  I think that the gas & propane outboards are using the same 123cc Tohatsu engine block.  	2.5 gallons of gas would weight about 15 pounds; the same as your estimate for a 5 pound propane tank.  The gas version can run off either and internal or external gas tank.
1053521,Old Man,2019-12-08 01:40:00,822,Keep in mind that propane has 27% less enegry than an equal volume of gasoline. 
1053609,pikehunter,2019-12-11 13:58:00,1659,Small note to add to Fisherman’s reply. Re: refillable 1 lb. propane tank at Home Depot U.S  is not available in store at least  at the the Niagara Falls N.Y locstion. Read the link carefully and you will see that it is available online only.
