1053638,bobowski,2019-12-12 12:30:00,360,I have a pop up hut that has a small slit near the bottom of one of the walls caused by an auger blade. The slit is about 5 inches long. I was thinking about patching it up with just a piece of duct tape or gorilla tape. Has anyone had an issue similar to this and if so what did you use to fix the problem? Thanks.
1053639,floater,2019-12-12 12:48:00,220,I've sewn up my torn hut using braided fishing line. A few loops at the ends of the cut and then sew up the middle. For good measure I put tuck tape over it inside and out and it's never been a problem since.

This is placed on both sides with atleast an inch and a half over sized than the hole.

1053641,gaspumper,2019-12-12 12:57:00,393,I used an iron on patch. 
1053680,FILTHY OAR,2019-12-13 19:03:00,65,What APL said but add a few stiches in a few places near the edge through the patch not on the tent portion to keep it in place. As for Iron on patch makeÂ certain you don't melt the fabric of your tent but I would still add a few stiches
