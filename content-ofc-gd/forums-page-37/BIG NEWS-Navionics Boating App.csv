1053371,mamona,2019-12-03 14:38:00,597,"Finally! I was buying 2 of them, one for my Android phone and one for my iPad."
1053384,David Chong,2019-12-03 16:54:00,836,"Yeah, glad they finally got it done!"
1053447,Sinker,2019-12-05 14:03:00,8692,"Good. Now about my ""LIFETIME"" subscription I got that expired.......  S."
1053451,GBW,2019-12-05 16:36:00,8460,Same...
1053469,David Chong,2019-12-06 01:51:00,836,"Once you have the app, you always have it, you do not need to renew your subscription to use it. But by renewing your subscription annually, you then have access to all the advanced features and updated mapping."
1053480,mamona,2019-12-06 15:06:00,597,Do you know which features exactly I am loosing if I do not renew?
1053484,GBW,2019-12-06 16:30:00,8460,The app will no longer function at all for me now so all of it...
1053487,KawarthaAngler,2019-12-06 17:14:00,273, That's odd.  I've had it on my phone for a few years now and haven't renewed it for well over a year and it runs fine.  All I'm missing are community edits/updates.  But where I live and fish ... the lake depths and hazards don't change so I ain't missing a thing. I use it when ice fishing and walking around looking for the spot to drill.  I use it when a guest in anothers boat and I want to mark a spot.  I use it when having lunch with someone and talk about a lake comes up.  It's great.
1053489,GBW,2019-12-06 17:27:00,8460,I've had it on my phone(s) since 2013 and now I cannot get past the welcome screen.  It's making my android get a new app.
1053491,David Chong,2019-12-06 17:47:00,836,"Shaded fishing ranges, daily updates, dock to dock auto routing, SonarCharts Live, weather, tides are a few things off the top of my head!"
1053493,KawarthaAngler,2019-12-06 18:27:00,273,stop talking like that ... you're making me want to renew account for another year!
1053511,Sinker,2019-12-07 16:25:00,8692,"No, I had to pay twice. The first time I purchased the app it was a lifetime subscription for something like $18. A year later, I had nothing but a welcome screen, and nothing else. So, I paid almost $40 to renew it. In that time, I got the deal on a new card, so that kind of kept me from whining. lol  S."
