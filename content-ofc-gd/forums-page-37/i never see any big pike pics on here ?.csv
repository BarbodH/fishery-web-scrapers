1051984,irishfield,2019-11-04 23:27:00,26272,LOL.. I'm still trying to revive the thing and she's taking selfies and started the fire and started cooking lunch! Love her like no other... 
1052003,ccmtcanada,2019-11-05 02:31:00,7971,My biggest pike. Â Was a blast to reel in!

Check out the one caught through the ice by Canadian Ice Fishing Expo speaker, Gordon G Pyzer while out with HT Enterprises Incâ€™s TGO, Tom Gruenwald Outdoors and In-Fishermanâ€™s Doug Stange (About the 3 minute mark)!Â If that doesnâ€™t get you fired up for the ice fishing season then nothing will! #MonsterPike #InFisherman #CanadianIceFishingExpo "

1051887,DRIFTER_016,2019-11-02 20:00:00,10439,I catch a couple here and there.Â Â ðŸ˜Ž          
1051891,tomO,2019-11-02 20:11:00,363,We went to Big Gull lake near Northbrook Ont. in Sept. I couldn'tÂ  believe how small they were. 12 or 14 inches long. A guy was telling us about the one that got away and he said you won't believe this but I bet that pikeÂ was 2 feet long.Â  I haven't been there since 2006 and the fishing was getting bad then I thought but man I couldn't believe it. The lake is as beautiful as it ever was but the fishing pressure must be relentless. Big boats every where and blast by you at full tilt 20 yards away. How far north or westÂ do you have to go these days to get into fishing like it was 30 or 40 years ago.
1051895,muskybw,2019-11-02 20:44:00,116,"WOW, there's some Lunker's in those PICS ! BIG FISH, thanks for the post ! never caught a big one, love the photos ! BillM, SirCranksalot, irishfield, DRIFTER_016, chris.brock, PUMP KNOWS, Moosebunk, Lew !Â  you have caught ABSOLUTE GATORS, only in my dream, GREAT PICS ! -"
1051896,dave524,2019-11-02 21:03:00,4508,There was a bunch when Solopaddler still posted here.
1051897,OhioFisherman,2019-11-02 21:13:00,6623,"Tennessee Guy used toÂ  post them all the time, some huge pike, but like some us age has idercaught up with us? We never considered a pike good sized until it hit the 40 inch mark, but fishing pressure has had an effect too?"
1051902,bigugli,2019-11-02 21:57:00,6138,The great adventure posters don't post here no more.

1051917,TennesseeGuy,2019-11-03 03:23:00,957,"Still fishing NW Ontario 16 - 23 days a year, every year.Â  Â Still catching my share of nice pike, but have shut down on taking photos.Â  Â They are unhooked whileÂ in my huge Frabil net, net is lowered andÂ pike smiles as she swims slowly away.Â  Â No out of water pictures, but a couple of short movies of the release, Â using polarized lensÂ as fish swims. Fortunately I haven't aged a bit.Â  Â God and medical professionals are punishing me by havingÂ me live too long. "

1051924,Tjames09,2019-11-03 13:42:00,664,Id imagine people don't like sharing spots anymore. To many people lurk forums that aren't members and then just go to these spots were they see fish. So if someone posts big pike in lake x. Guess what lake will have 100x more people at it.
1051926,OhioFisherman,2019-11-03 14:28:00,6623,Glad to hear you are still going strong Connie! Keep at it!
1051934,BillM,2019-11-03 15:50:00,17367,Lots of big pike have been posted here.Â  A few examples.   
1051942,SirCranksalot,2019-11-03 17:02:00,3291,This is about as big as I have caught. I'd like to have a better pic but when I tried to hold it up it jumped out of the canoe ---T'was a big laugh.The story was better than a pic! No steel leader---per MNR there were noÂ  pike listed for that lake!ðŸ˜ƒ 
1051944,irishfield,2019-11-03 17:18:00,26272,Unfortunate that after over an hour of revival attempt it died. Cost me a grand to have taxiderm'd for her.    
1051945,Whitespinnerbait,2019-11-03 17:57:00,2038,Would love Â to see Â proof of this.....
1051947,chris.brock,2019-11-04 00:51:00,4053,I love chasing big pike    
1051950,PUMP KNOWS,2019-11-04 01:33:00,937,Very Very nice. Not pics but some underwater pike strikes I filmed 2 years ago

1051961,NAW,2019-11-04 14:40:00,4022,My 6 year old caught this in the spring!  I think I posted a report about the trip..Â  Can't remember.  
1051962,AKRISONER,2019-11-04 14:57:00,5558,looking back im on a bit of a drought for a monster. I personally havent caught one over 40 in a while. Might need to start chasing them a bit more frequently again!        
1051975,jimmer,2019-11-04 19:59:00,2730,Nice fish! I should get back into taxidermy if that's what people are willing to pay now. It must have made a beautiful mount.
