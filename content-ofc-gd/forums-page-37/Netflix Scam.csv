1053191,KawarthaAngler,2019-11-28 15:56:00,273,That is not a Netflix scam.  That is a scam artist using Netflix as a disguise.  In the same fashion I get emails about my bank account being frozen (at a bank I've never had an account) or my Apple account having an unauthorized purchase (which it didn't).  The scammers try to fool many into clicking on their bogus links in the emails.  Watch out!
