How you mounted your transdeucer and 2. Does your side imaging work without having to trim your motor entirely out of the water. I know this seems ridiculous but of course he doesn’t trust what I have to say because my boat is a bass boat so according to him they are “nothing alike”"
1053533,Musky Plug,2019-12-08 20:24:00,398,"I have a friend who had a legend boat, similar to your dad's which had the side imaging problem. Brought it back to the dealer several times but they couldn't figure it out. It could have been that whoever installed it was inexperienced. They ended up putting a second ducer on the other side of the boat and they ran simultaneously to provide the picture to the unit. On the flip side I have a friend who has a Ranger 621 and he runs Lowerance (if that matters) but he has no issues what so ever with his SI pictures, and he runs one ducer. This site has been helpful for me in the past, might be worth checking out.  http://forums.sideimagingsoft.com/index.php?PHPSESSID=tbcr9ig6e7k7pgha6u25s2kek3&"
1053534,porkpie,2019-12-08 21:00:00,2521,"I have what could be considered a very deep boat.  I do occasionally lose some signal on the port side of the boat.  I have my transducer mounted pretty low on the boat on a Berts sonar board.   I’ve fiddled with height a bit but sometimes the left side signal is just not as crisp.  I’m running a totalscan transducer.  For me it’s not a huge issue because I don’t rely on my sidescan near as often as a structure fisherman would.  While I do target structure, a ton of my fishing is targeting open water suspended fish.  So, while I wouldn’t panic, it can be an issue.  If I relied on it more heavily I’d be looking for a fix, and I’m not quite sure what the fix is."
1053538,BillM,2019-12-09 00:59:00,17367,Most of the times it's the main getting in the way of the side scan.  I don't have that problem on my Lund however.
1053539,HTHM,2019-12-09 04:08:00,4082,Just tell him to get a jackplate.
1053540,Garnet,2019-12-09 11:49:00,2056,I closed the bottom of my jack plate for little better hole shot. My SI is bolted to this plate so between motor an transom. I was careful to not have a strake  messing water  coming off hull. Don't remember reading  that this could be a problem. Mine is bassboat an lowrance. 
1053541,Dan668,2019-12-09 12:50:00,1120,I just trim up a bit on my impact and then my port side readings are clear. Only using sidescan at low speeds anyways.
1053542,AKRISONER,2019-12-09 13:49:00,5558,"This was my thought as well, simply trim up a bit and it should be fine right? his old unit no matter what you did completely lost it’s signal on the right side and hence he’s convinced it will be the same with his boat. My understanding was that the side beam is narrow front to back so if you aren’t trimmed totally down you won’t have an issue. a jack plate would definitely solve the issue but remounting the main is Not gonna happen lol"
1053548,JoshS,2019-12-09 17:21:00,729,"If motor is full trim down, I have to trim up the slightest to get clear view on the port side. My buddies boat is the same thing. Not a big issue."
1053581,b_cdot,2019-12-10 13:53:00,270,similar experience as others. On my lund I just trim up and the pic becomes more clear.
1053586,AKRISONER,2019-12-10 15:19:00,5558,"this is great. I think my dad somewhat believes me now when i tell him that trimming up a little will solve his problem. this all stemmed from him being convinced his motor was causing issues with the previous deucer, however it didnt show the right beam even with the motor out of the water."
1053598,Freshtrax,2019-12-10 22:31:00,2215,I do have to trim up ever so slightly on 19ft legend to get good image.
