1037659,misfish,2018-12-08 19:08:00,29133,"Ok, so from my last experience, the jaw jacker was legal.  NOW  Thy have a new addition to it. Seen at Cabelas. It has a battery operated jigging set up. So ,unmanned rod,jigging.  Legal ????????????  Seems to take all the fun out of the sport if you as me.  I can except the jaw breaker as a set the hook I am to lazy too, but this new jigging set up is too much. "
1037663,cheaptackle,2018-12-08 19:57:00,849,Don't know the product but from yer description Brian it sounds a lot like the downriggers that move cannon balls up & down automatically?  Just guessing...  Michael
1037667,bobowski,2018-12-08 20:36:00,360,Ya saw this today at the show. Guy told me that it was totally legal as the rod still sets the hook. Couldn't believe the price tag. $130 for the base that jigs your rod up and down. lol. I wouldn't think that the batteries on the thing would work very long in -20 degree temps. And can you imagine the chunk of ice that would form on your line.
1037669,Terry,2018-12-08 20:43:00,14456,A windlass tip up jigs by itself. So I don’t know
1037671,misfish,2018-12-08 21:00:00,29133,Stupid ass price.  I looked for you at the show this morning. We all look like ice anglers. LOL
1037681,BillM,2018-12-09 01:01:00,17367,"I looked at that thing and started to laugh, lol.    Got some Meegz at the show today."
1037694,PUMP KNOWS,2018-12-09 14:57:00,937,
1037695,misfish,2018-12-09 16:44:00,29133,$125 for the base
1037697,pike slayer,2018-12-09 18:06:00,1177,"I believe a guy from the sault area ""invented"" it. Everything is legal. Its identical to the automatic fishermen but now with some batteries to jig it. Now I'm interested."
1037828,Crackerjack,2018-12-12 12:42:00,34,"Thats cool, and right in time for Christmas!"
1037837,jimmer,2018-12-12 15:17:00,2730,"Some people have too much money if they spend it on something like this. Not saying it won't work, but are we fishing or do we want a device to fish for us?"
1037849,SirCranksalot,2018-12-12 22:31:00,3291,No kidding!! That's the reaction I had. I must admit I built a Jaw Jacker type of rig but hardly ever set it up because setting the hook is part of the fun!! 
1037881,AKRISONER,2018-12-13 15:14:00,5558,would still much rather just use a rolder holder tip up. I dont want the damn machine setting the hook for me...One of the funnest things in ice fishing is seeing the flag go off and line peeling off of your spool. closing the bail reeling up the slack and setting the hook.
1037889,Spiel,2018-12-13 17:22:00,9065,"That's just what I was thinking, batteries not included... lol "
1038292,Terry,2018-12-25 18:02:00,14456,Seems my wife thought I needed a jaw jacker for Xmas.    Don’t know if I would use it or not Guess I have to try it.     Just the one that sets the hook not the one that jigs
1038294,misfish,2018-12-25 18:56:00,29133, You need alllllll the help you can get.
1038295,misfish,2018-12-25 19:06:00,29133,"So does this mean your going back to live bait ?  If so,my statement above, still stands. LOL  JAW     JACKER"
1038296,Terry,2018-12-25 20:18:00,14456,"no, like i said dont know if i would use it"
1038711,Rattletrap2,2019-01-04 16:47:00,1652,"Go ahead Terry, give it a try. You are retired now and need to conserve your energy! lol"
1053306,Dan668,2019-12-01 19:38:00,1120,"Didn't want to start a new post, anyone ever get to use one of these? Seen they were on sale at Cabelas this weekend. Now 100, still expensive. Thinking it could be decent for a second line set up... Maybe.."
1053308,Terry,2019-12-01 19:47:00,14456,I have had one for a year but have never used it I thought my wife paid 35 bucks for it last year
1053309,Dan668,2019-12-01 19:54:00,1120,"Oh, I'm talking about the jigging base addon, lol. I have a jaw jacker unit that was 40. Haven't used it much though."
1053310,SirCranksalot,2019-12-01 21:01:00,3291,Half the fun is setting the hook. I have 1 or 2 that I made just for S & Gs but can't be bothered to set it up.
1053315,BillM,2019-12-01 22:47:00,17367,You saw that stupid thing to when you walked into the fishing section eh?   lol I just laughed.
