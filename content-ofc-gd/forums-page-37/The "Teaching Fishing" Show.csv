1053440,Niagara Fishing Show,2019-12-05 03:54:00,7,"About 6 weeks remain before the opening of the Greater Niagara Fishing & Outdoor Expo on January 17th at 1 pm. This show is known as the ""Teaching Fishing"" which is what makes it unique from other events of this kind. The show facility - the Conference and Event Center Niagara Falls - provides a unique blend of being able to offer a spacious Exhibitor Event Center, as well as a multitude of seminar rooms all utilizing ""State of the Art"" technology. The show utilizes these rooms plus the Hawg Trough to deliver up to 18 classes run concurrently, each targeting different topics/levels of expertise. The classes are taught by local and regional experts very knowledgeable in fishing the Western and Central NY waterways.    New for this year, each class will be developed for a specific level of expertise including:  1. Beginner / Casual Level - The angler who is just starting out or who has limited knowledge on the topic. Attending these classes will dramatically shorten the learning curve and provide the opportunity for attendees to save some ""Tackle $$"" by purchasing what is needed to get started. 	2. Experienced Level - The angler with some experience on the topic who is looking to pick up additional knowledge from more experienced anglers that will enable them to make tweaks to their program to increase their success. 	3. Expert / Tournament Angler - The ""diehard"" angler who is looking to increase their knowledge and skills on the topic by taking ""advanced"" classes taught by some of the best of the best anglers on the water.  The 2020 show will offer attendees the opportunity to attend over 200 free classes over the 3 days of the show. The 2019 show saw attendees taking the opportunity to increase their fishing knowledge by attending on average over 5 classes during the duration of the Expo. The core belief of the show is that it is making a difference toward the effort to grow the sport of fishing by providing a vast amount of fishing education to our attendees. By providing this education, this show will recruit new anglers, including the next generation, to the sport as well as providing existing anglers the fishing knowledge to increase their enjoyment of the time they spend on the water by being more successful. The education also allows anglers to diversify to include other species and tactics if they so desire.  The 2020 curriculum of all free classes is guaranteed to improve your skills. The curriculum includes classes on the following: 	1. Lake Ontario Trout & Salmon 	2. Lake Erie & Inland Lake Walleye 	3. Lake Erie, Ontario & Inland Lakes Bass 	4.
