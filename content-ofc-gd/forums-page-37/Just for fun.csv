""Like sitting on the couch, watching TV and drinking wine is not a good thing?"" I asked. Talking about my ""doing-something-useful"" seems to be her favorite topic of conversation. She was ""only thinking of me"", she said and suggested that I go down to 	the Senior Center and hang out with the guys. I did this and when I got home last night, I decided to play a prank on her. I e-mailed her and told her that I had joined a Parachute Club. She replied, ""Are you nuts? You are 73 years old and now you're going to start jumping out of airplanes?"" I told her that I even got a Membership Card and e-mailed a copy to her.  She immediately telephoned me and yelled, ""Good grief, dad, where are 	your glasses?"" This is a membership in a Prostitute Club, not a Parachute Club!"" ""Oh man, I'm in trouble again,"" I said, ""I really don't know what to do. I signed up for five jumps a week!"" The line went quiet and her friend picked up the phone and said that my daughter had fainted. Life as a Senior Citizen is not getting any easier, but sometimes it can 	be fun. "
