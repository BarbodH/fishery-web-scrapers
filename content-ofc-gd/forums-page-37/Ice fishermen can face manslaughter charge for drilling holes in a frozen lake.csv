1053200,canoecarrier,2019-11-28 18:02:00,54,I often wonder what kind of a fish you are catching in Ontario that you would need a 10 inch hole for ?
1053201,misfish,2019-11-28 18:34:00,29133,20-30 lb lake trout
1053208,Fisherman,2019-11-28 21:10:00,7201,"Too many people texting on the way to their special spot and fall in, lol."

1053212,DRIFTER_016,2019-11-29 01:11:00,10439,
1053214,Whitespinnerbait,2019-11-29 02:56:00,2038,Well said !!!
1053216,AKRISONER,2019-11-29 04:11:00,5558,"Im surprised no one here is talking about the YouTube sensation this ice season that is cutting out 6x6 holes in the ice. i donâ€™t think this is talking about holes that you have drilled, itâ€™s talking about the guys cutting out sight fishing holes on lakes. uncut angling and jay siemens have been cutting huge holes this year and itâ€™s a bit of a troubling trend because although those guys are responsible and are making their holes very well and making disclaimers in the videos to ensure you mark your holes, you just know that some idiot is going to Watch YouTube and then go out right off the access on cooks bay and cut an 8x8 hole in the ice and not mark it. the hole will skim over with a thin layer of snow and some poor bugger is going to fall right into it...I can already see it coming"
1053221,dave524,2019-11-29 13:03:00,4508,"I recall going camping with my parents back in the early sixties, enjoyed getting ice for the cooler cause it was cut from the lake and stored in a log building covered in sawdust. Must have lost a lot of people down the massive holes that were left from that operationÂ ðŸ¤£."
1053237,DRIFTER_016,2019-11-29 18:04:00,10439,They harvest a crap load of ice for the Snow Kings Castle every year here. These are for windows in the castle. They fence off the hole when they are done harvesting.   These are for the big ice carving contest during the winter/spring carnival.    
1053243,Sinker,2019-11-29 19:23:00,8692,My dad still does this with iceberg ice. Always has a stockpile covered in saw dust. 
1053089,FishFishing,2019-11-26 16:46:00,31,https://fishncanada.com/news/ice-fishermen-can-face-manslaughter-charge-for-drilling-holes-in-a-frozen-lake/?fbclid=IwAR3ePIRmsokvfaAGo7RrdmYFrZ3yEZ6Ljj49mooX-YCBvi5U-Y2cA9NXfrQ  What do ya think about this?
1053090,Terry,2019-11-26 17:05:00,14456,Sure when we use to cut holes with chainsaws we would markÂ the holes with trees if we moved the hut 
1053099,Fisherman,2019-11-26 20:32:00,7201,"It's been in the books for a long time, same as leaving an open ""hole"" where people can fall in in construction sites."
1053115,Woodsman,2019-11-27 03:52:00,1286,Story is almost 2 years old???
1053118,Big Cliff,2019-11-27 13:05:00,6899,"It's just plain nuts, everything is always someone else's fault these days, how about being responsible for watching where you are going. If you are out there walking around on the ice you have to accept the fact that there are hazards involved."
1053119,Ronzo,2019-11-27 13:07:00,124,"If you've taken your 10"" auger out and drilled the crap out of the ice surface, left it unmarked, and someone falls in, you probably should be on the hook. "
1053125,AKRISONER,2019-11-27 14:29:00,5558,"Like any article, take it with a grain of salt. I do agree though that if you chainsaw out a site fishing hole in a commonly traveled areaÂ and dont mark it...you are 1 a total idiot with complete disregard for other people 2. I can see how in court you could definitely be held legally accountable. Its not much different than stringing out fence wire at neck level on a commonly snowmobiled area. Someone gets decapitated you as the guy who strung that wire could be held accountable."
1053128,lew,2019-11-27 14:46:00,12766,One of the stupidest statements I've ever read on this board.
1053129,AKRISONER,2019-11-27 14:54:00,5558,I know of a first hand account of this happening in muskoka. My best friend was at a cottage with his girlfriends family and her uncle literally got decapitated.Â Not sure why itâ€™s a stupid statement.
1053131,lew,2019-11-27 15:05:00,12766,It's stupid statement because your comparing intentional murder with someone forgetting to mark a hole in the ice.
1053155,irishfield,2019-11-27 22:29:00,26272,"Dock bubblers and impellors will come up next! Not much safe ice anymore in the Muskokas, although it looks like the MNR might start going after owners for ""disturbing fish habitat""."
1053158,Musky Plug,2019-11-27 22:43:00,398,"I agree, however what are you do when you're out on the ice with nothing to mark open holes with?"
1053159,Fisherman,2019-11-27 22:48:00,7201,"I don't suspect you will be admonished for leave 8-10 inch holes open unmarked.Â  I believe the intent was more for those leaving gaping holes open a whole body could fall into.Â  A cedar or pine bough would probably suffice if you plan on making large holes, easy enough to bring along."
1053160,misfish,2019-11-27 22:49:00,29133,"Yet we all know why they do it. To protect their over priced pretty docks and boat houses from ice freeze up and causing damage. The few tripsÂ  have made to Lake Joe, I have seen them an have also seen anglers get as close to the open water from the bubblers to catch fish, as the bubblers add more oxygen, which attracks bait, fish and angler. So whom is responsible if the angler goes in ? Angler for his stupidity IMO.  "
1053161,Ronzo,2019-11-27 22:49:00,124,"Don't drill a dangerous number of holes of a dangerous size. To me, this argument is like saying ""What am I to do with my garbage other than throw it on the ice? I didn't bring a bag to put it in"". You should be properly prepared for whatever you're planning on doing on the ice."
1053163,misfish,2019-11-27 22:53:00,29133,"I don't get the ones that feel the need to cut mickey mouse holes with 8-10"" augers. I use only a single 6"" hole and manage quite well. Right Terry ? ðŸ¤£"
1053164,Musky Plug,2019-11-27 23:07:00,398,"Maybe the thought was that they would freeze up and close before something like that would happen?  Yes i agree not to make the ice unsafe for others, and being prepared howeverÂ I don't think that was the intention. I disagree with the garbage statement, you could stuff it in your pocket or tackle bag. People who do that are ignorant and lazy."
1053165,Ronzo,2019-11-27 23:22:00,124,"You and me both. If I move, I'm filling the hole with ice and leaving it marked.Â I'm not big on drilling holes in perching grounds large enough for a kid to fall through. That said, I am also the kind of person to set up the hut, tell my kid(s) to stay by the hut, then go walk the area to make sure we're not fishing where someone with an auger larger than their common senseÂ has been fishing."
1053166,Terry,2019-11-27 23:22:00,14456,The headline is manslaughter A10 inch Â hole Â will not get you charge with manslaughter itâ€™s the big holes left when you remove a permanent shack. Â As in a hole big enough to fall in and drown
1053167,misfish,2019-11-27 23:41:00,29133,"OH, OK Many left after March 15th . Many thinking NO ONE will be out after that.Â  They need to rethink that."
1053168,Terry,2019-11-27 23:52:00,14456,Are you saying you can drown in a ten inch hole
1053172,Fisherman,2019-11-28 00:34:00,7201,"He's going in head first and get stuck, lol.ðŸ¥³"
1053173,irishfield,2019-11-28 00:49:00,26272,"Like the figure 8 x 10"" I saved your Brother from stepping into out of Lloyd's van one day on Kemp.... What is the point of this nonsense?"
1053174,Fisherman,2019-11-28 00:56:00,7201,"A quick check of CC 263(1) has the possibility of lesser charges depending on the severity of hurt inflicted.Â  However these are not open and closed cases, there are things to prove, #1 probably being, who made the hole, was their intent to harm anyone, and the unscrupulousÂ  lawyers will take lots of your money to haggle and you will lose time at work and pay. On a side note, just watched on news how insurance coverage for snowplow contractors has gone through the roof, one guy went from $16K to $60K for coverage because of one claim of slip and fall.Â  Wonder how much the shysters made off that case."
1053185,Sinker,2019-11-28 14:16:00,8692,"I can't remember the last time I saw the hole enforcement officers out there.....oh ya....there aren't any.  Don't be stupid, watch where your going, and you should survive.  S."
