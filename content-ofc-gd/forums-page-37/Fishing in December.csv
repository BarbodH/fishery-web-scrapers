1053591,Old Ironmaker,2019-12-10 18:41:00,8243,The 1st think that comes to mind is the excellent shore fishing on the lower Niagara River. I don't know a thing about T.O. fishing. Probably the last place on earth I would go to if I didn't have to. And I lived there for a few years. Welcome aboard as well Antonio.
1053592,dave524,2019-12-10 18:42:00,4508,"Niagara River , both upper around Fort Erie and lower at Queenston and Whirlpool edit: the idiots should be mostly gone from Erindale Park by now, used to do very well there as well"
1053593,misfish,2019-12-10 21:15:00,29133,Why don't you guys hold his hand and guide him ? ðŸ¤£ Welcome Anthony. Your about 30-40 years to late for the good fishing with low number anglers.
1053613,BillM,2019-12-11 14:42:00,17367,"Niagara River is the easy choice here.Â  Although you've got some options on the north shore as well, nothing is locked up yet."
1053642,antonio77,2019-12-12 14:45:00,32,"Thank you very much everyone! I may try Niagara and see how it goes. It is always great to learn from people who have more experience. I know each day is different, but would you recommend raw or jig is better? Anyone trying around Wassaga beach that time of year? Or it is useless Thank you guys"
1053670,Old Ironmaker,2019-12-13 15:48:00,8243,3 out of 3 that answered your question and all 3 said to go to The Niagara River and you might try it? Go to Wasaga I hear it's on fire. Is that better?
1053674,antonio77,2019-12-13 16:43:00,32,Thanks. Definitely I will go to Niagara but I do not think to mention personal plans for the holiday and that I will go to Wasaga as well. I just need an opinion :)
