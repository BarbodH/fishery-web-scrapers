I thought a weekday would of been best, but NOPE. Dosent anyone work these days ? Was enjoying fishing the hole with my new friend. Was nice. Then the cast over your line,up over in front of you. MY GAWD. There was no care in the world by these anglers. It,s like it,s a natural thing to do . If the long walks and hikes didn't bother my knee, I would be all alone. Just the way I liked it. Guess I shouldn't complain then eh ? deal with it,or stop river fishing. NOT. I wonder if I would be arrested if I had a fake AK water gun strapped to me ? LOL  "
