1052846,muskybw,2019-11-21 00:30:00,116,"it wasn't big, hit a 10 in. hard bait, 4 trebles & flew out of the water when hooked, beautiful pattern & color. OCTOBER 19TH, I POSTED PICS--the fish in the holding tank, tiger musky, is the fish in this pic. "
1052849,b_cdot,2019-11-21 02:51:00,270,Beauty fish!
1052850,Moosebunk,2019-11-21 04:01:00,3970,Is it a tiger for sure? It's a real clean and healthy fish.
1052854,Old Ironmaker,2019-11-21 04:11:00,8243,"Looks like 1 to me. I have boated 1 in my life so I must be an expert. If you ever want to start an argument ask a bunch of Musky hunters ""Is this a Tiger Musky?"""
1052861,Garfisher,2019-11-21 14:50:00,229,"I think it's just a regular muskie as the tail lobes seem pretty pointed (it's the only real clear ID feature), but regardless that's a nice fish!Â ðŸ˜Ž"
1052863,AKRISONER,2019-11-21 16:29:00,5558,looks like a regular ski to me as well nice catch either way
1052866,BillM,2019-11-21 17:55:00,17367,"I'm thinking a barred muskie, either way beauty fish!!!"
1052871,muskybw,2019-11-21 19:19:00,116,"on october 19th i posted pics from ST.CLAIR with my son, the fish in the holding tank is this fish in this photo, TIGER."

1052884,Tjames09,2019-11-22 00:12:00,664,"Nice fish, I originally thought it looked more like a barred regular musky, but either way. Think tigers have the pattern on the face."
1052890,Pigeontroller,2019-11-22 03:07:00,2793,"Looks like a Tiger to me, but the tail fins aren't round... Biologists will not id them just by the markings, but will count the pores on the under side of the jaw."
1052894,John Bacon,2019-11-22 05:13:00,3277,I am not sure what holding tank pictures you are referring to; but are there any features in particular that would indicate that it is a tiger?Â  The tail and fins look to be very pointed which is associated with pure strain musky.
1052896,misfish,2019-11-22 10:25:00,29133,"I am not a musky guy, so don't know the difference, but it is a niceÂ  musky."
1052902,Moosebunk,2019-11-22 18:43:00,3970,"Remember posting this one years back that I thought was a tiger muskie.Â  Had similar markings to the fish in this post AND it had the very rounded tiger / pike tail. Was newer to muskie fishing so didn't know for sure, but was told by some hereÂ it's just a barred muskie.Â  Thing of it is, there can likelyÂ be some variations considering a 1st generation tiger couldÂ reproduce with a 100% pike or muskie down the line and offset their typical appearances even more... I suppose? "
1052904,Terry,2019-11-22 18:52:00,14456,I thought tiger Muskie were sterile
1052908,BillM,2019-11-22 20:11:00,17367,It is.
1052910,Moosebunk,2019-11-22 20:26:00,3970,Shows what I know about 'em! lol. 
1052911,FILTHY OAR,2019-11-22 20:28:00,65,"it's a barred musky, back at it you go..."
1052915,irishfield,2019-11-22 21:44:00,26272,NICE fish !
1052928,Old Ironmaker,2019-11-23 12:34:00,8243,"I have one that I had mounted in 81'. I have had Musky experts agree and disagree it is a true Tiger. That was a time you killed and stuffed fish. For many years latter I felt guilty I had it stuffed, then I found out they can't breed. I hope that's true. And I agree what a nice clean Musky. LSC, yep they have that light shade maybe because of the clear water. I found the Pics are a lighter shade too when we fished the lake many Moons ago."
1052977,Rizzo,2019-11-24 13:02:00,4754,"sorry...another opinion that says barred musky. Either way, very nice fish with awesome markings"
1052978,lew,2019-11-24 13:17:00,12766,No such thing as a bad musky no matter what the markings are...they're all good
1053023,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2019-11-25 09:57:00,535,"Looks like barred musky to me as well. Don't feel too bad, I have been duped into thinking I had caught a tiger musky before."
1053162,Heavy Current,2019-11-27 22:51:00,20,Thatâ€™s a Tiger
1053213,J Roelofsen,2019-11-29 01:15:00,84,Definitely a barred 'ski....the very pointed tail is a dead giveaway. Beautiful looking fish! Josh
