1053419,OhioFisherman,2019-12-04 16:41:00,6623,"Fresh, we have a Grand River here too that empties into Lake Erie in Painesville Ohio, after some digging I found out it has a limited natural occurring muskie population."
1053446,OhioFisherman,2019-12-05 13:45:00,6623,Something fishy in the fall? The pending leader heard he would have to take a polygraph test and dropped out? Hmmm? Sad to have things like that happen.

1052151,Old Ironmaker,2019-11-09 17:43:00,8243,"I have heard of a  few Musky caught by guys fishing Largemouth in Long Point Bay the last few years. I have not heard of anyone targeting them specifically. Talk about Lake Erie news. I was up all night during that 100 year storm on Halloween. Winds were measured to have been gusting at 150 KPH's. Many homes and cottages had up to 4' of water in them and they are 70 or more feet across Lakeshore road from the lake. My buddies large deck that was built by his Dad in the early 60's ended up on the neighbours lawn 4 door down the road. Another pals old place (RIP Big Show) that his daughter now has has an 80' Willow tree in the living room. With all the torrential rain it might be a write off. Numerous friends and neighbours lost shingles and rain soaked through to the drywall. The county brought out the snow graders back hoes and loaders to clear huge logs, pieces of boathouses, boats, boat lifts and decks as well as the foot or more of sand and mud on Lakeshore road. They are still working today scooping out debris in the drainage ditches. We faired pretty well. a dead Ash tree on the bank snapped about 4' above the roots and was stopped from hitting our place by a small branch on a Maple tree or we would have had a major problem. My boat cover was ripped open and when it isn't blowing here I need to get the Zebra Mussels off the seats and dash. Lost a small section of grass on the bank but no big deal, not a  shingle lost. When I had the roof done 5 years ago I insisted the contractor fasten all the shingles down as it said in that little piece of paper no one reads when they tear open a bundle. I was up all night, I thought we were. I thought we were on our way to Kansas. We got lucky. By the way or cottage is listed for sale. To see it just Google 16 Hoover Point Lane Selkirk On. My wife did a beautiful job decorating or as they say staging it. My credit card has more damage on it than that storm. Johnny D"
1052159,OhioFisherman,2019-11-09 18:58:00,6623,"Nice place John. That storm hit  here too, I saw a news story that said there was a 10 foot difference in the water level between Toledo and Buffalo."
1052165,Pigeontroller,2019-11-09 23:39:00,2793,Oh they're out there.... 
1052171,OhioFisherman,2019-11-10 02:22:00,6623,"Nice fish Pigeon! Years ago I caught pike in the very early spring here, never personally caught a ski or even hooked one fishing Erie. About 40 years ago a friend caught one around 10 pounds around the Avon Lake power plant and he was a straight up guy so I believed it. They would make the Lake a bit more interesting to fish?"
1052178,Whopper,2019-11-10 13:00:00,2174,"Paul, more reports of people catching muskies by accident in the western basin and island area the past few years. Guys that are targeting them are tight lipped about what they are doing. The few that I have seen look just like the St Clair fish and I suspect that is where they are coming from."
1052179,dave524,2019-11-10 13:03:00,4508,Bunch of them in the upper Niagara River at the other end of Erie as well. Heard of a few being caught in Gravelly Bay at Port Colborne as well.
1052190,OhioFisherman,2019-11-10 15:10:00,6623,Hi Phil! It would make sense that some of those Lake St. Clair fish would wander down this way? Have you seen any new areas of weed growth around the island area? I can picture them finding a mix of habitat in Sandusky Bay or possibly East Harbor but the main lake was pretty devoid of weeds. Still fishing with  Captain Joe?
1052193,OhioFisherman,2019-11-10 15:25:00,6623,"Saw some videos of guys fishing the Buffalo harbor area and catching them too, LOL, one charter captain didn't want that stinky fish in his boat. At times I wonder about DNR's decisions, they could have stocked muskies on this side instead of Coho or Steelhead? Not a species that wasn't native, although at one point in time there may have been trout here, LOL before humans improved things?"
1052196,Old Ironmaker,2019-11-10 16:58:00,8243,"Thanks Paul, yes Tich did a great job both using the brad nailer once she got the hang of it, she loves it, as well as decorating. The amazing thing here was after the storm we had a sandy beach again. We haven't had beach for 3 years. It means your side of the lake or east or west of us had higher shoreline like we had on the 31st and 1st. They call it "" the bathtub effect."" When the south shore of the lake is getting pounded the north shore levels drop and vice versa. Very nice Musky Pigeontroller. Like I said only a few reports I have read or heard personally of Musky catches in Long Point Bay or the western basin. Musky guys are tight lipped. It's a lot of work and expense to target those things. Heck those bricks you guys toss at them are 20 bucks or more. I don't blame them for being members of a secret society."
1052211,Pigeontroller,2019-11-10 22:40:00,2793,"Buffalo Harbor was a real hot spot in the 90s due to a warm water discharge that's no longer a factor, and I'm guessing some real good year classes. Googling Buffalo Harbor Musky will show you some incredible specimens with 50'' lengths and  huge girths. Long Point Bay gets mentioned more and more...Anywhere there's good spawning water will attract Muskies, they usually arrive in fall and winter over, make love come spring time and then head out to the blue water to eat all summer long..."
1052214,AKRISONER,2019-11-11 03:12:00,5558,PAUL castellano hooked one in the Niagara river during the 39 hours series on YouTube
1052216,dave524,2019-11-11 10:23:00,4508,"Lot's of big muskies recently on the "" FishIn  Niagara "" facebook page out of the Niagara River."

1052238,Old Ironmaker,2019-11-11 19:58:00,8243,The article goes onto explain the angler got not just 1 outside Cleveland which is a rarity but he hooked a second Musky that broke him off. What are the odds? It also said the angler plans on mounting his 40 some odd incher. Didn't say anything about a replimount (new word). Too bad he had to kill it.

The two years that had the heaviest first place fish also had the highest average weight fish for the top five. Our area had like 5 inches of snow last Monday evening into Tuesday, a bit early for that much snow here, and it wasn't completely gone until Sunday, which probably affected the opportunities for people to get out in safe weather.

1053138,OhioFisherman,2019-11-27 16:30:00,6623,"Fall brawl ends Sunday, and the leaders fish at 12.690 may hold up, it's been sort of crappy weather to get on Erle."
1053330,OhioFisherman,2019-12-02 16:49:00,6623,"It's over and that 12.690 fish seems to have held up, given the weather in the area the last month or so it's not a surprise, opportunities to get out safely on Lake Erie, or even some of it's break walls and piers was reduced. Weather may have also affected their feeding? resulting in lower weights? Although for a lot of the warmer water season there seemed to be a shortage of Emerald Shiners. Not sure how much a 10+ pound walleye depends on 3-4 minnows for food? Can't complain about walleyes that size no matter where you are?"
1053333,Whopper,2019-12-02 18:03:00,2174,Paul I saw a pic of a eight pound walleye on the cleaning table that had 1/2 dozen bluegills and a couple small perch in it's gut
1053342,OhioFisherman,2019-12-02 22:13:00,6623,"That doesn't really surprise me Phil, as a kid Sandusky Bay was one of our spring hot spots for Crappie and Blue gills, and I have caught walleye in the bay in the spring bass fishing, some seem slower than others to move out to the main lake? LOL, surprised the weren't full of small carp? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redear_sunfish These may become more common in Erie with all the zebra mussels?"
