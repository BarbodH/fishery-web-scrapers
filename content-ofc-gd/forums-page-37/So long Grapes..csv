Seems all you have to offer. The term 'haters' comes to mind. Here is another thing to consider. I know many immigrants and have found that when first arriving they enjoy viewing their traditional sports. India folks I know love cricket, Palestinians say soccer is their fav and 'Kabaddi' is another India sport that I was asked to but was unable to attend at Rogers Stadium. Red necks and more traditional Canadians are more the hockey fans and the viewers of¬†his show. To say he is focusing insults on just the wee percentage of 'immigrant' viewers and that he is not addressing the vast % of viewers who are not.... letting them off the hook re poppies is quite ridiculous. I meet new immigrants every day and many can't understand English so I doubt¬†they even listen to the¬†show. Oh and its been said here he can't identify immigrants since they are of all diff colors. Again, points to his obvious discrimination against any and all who don't wear one. You all need to forgive an old gentleman who apologized for using the wrong phrase who said he should have used the word 'everyone' instead. We all forgive this kind of stuff every day. I speak with someone in a hallway and someone else strolls up and begins speaking to the person in their native tongue. I say sorry folks Human Rights Code says speak in a language all here understand. But I don't run off trying to get anyone fired. But if they continue (never had this happen) I walk away and later when asked ""Why did you go?"" I give heck and blame the person I was speaking with for allowing a rude interruption. Still friends though. But LA may be on to something. Perhaps a ticket should be issued for people not wearing a poppy. $5. maybe. $10. if their kid isn't wearing it. JK but we should all expect the education system is properly teaching the young about what the poppy means. If there is a trend of less poppy wearing happening the issue is what can be done about it. Nobody focuses on this important consideration. Media hasn't from what I've seen. Instead media has sensationalized things to get folks upset and watching their shows/ads.¬†¬† All about money. Sad.  Oh and LA,¬† closest thing to a 'fact' is that Cherry wants everyone to wear a poppy¬†and he is pissed that many people don't. Lots of proof over the years about this. His wording was admittedly wrong and he agrees he should have used the word 'everyone'. I agree with this sentiment, accept his apology and I encourage¬†you do as well. Also¬†I hope you wore a poppy and explained its meaning to your young son. Some here lost folks during a war and this whole poppy twist that media is pushing taints things somewhat. In my view the media is disrespectful of the dead and the ones who lost them.   "
1052920,limeyangler,2019-11-23 03:45:00,5204,"I did not insult the lawyer, I said their logic was ridiculous and gave crystal clear reasons as to how I came to that conclusion, ¬†I did not call them any names, but you then call me names by saying I‚Äôm a hater, hater of what?

1052921,limeyangler,2019-11-23 04:48:00,5204,"Well I will say it again, some portions of society have always been and will always rightly be offended by RACISM. ¬†Talking about RACISM and calling it the 'R'¬†word, seems pointless when everyone knows what we are talking about. The word RACISM or RACIST¬†is not offensive in and of itself, but it is very interesting when I think about why somebody would find it offensive, so offensive it starts getting the ""C"" word treatment. Why are people so sensitive when the word arises? Why do they become defensive? I think sometimes it is because people don't think of themselves as racist because racism is now seen as something 'BAD' which is consciously enacted by individuals, and therefore if a person does not see themselves as¬†¬†RACIST (good)¬†you are attacking a person's identity and moral character. But racism is not just about ¬†good and bad individuals and agency, it is also about a system of RACISM, that acts below the surface of the¬†'common sense' you mentioned, a system that necessarily embodies,¬†reproduces and protects RACISM and the resultant¬†the inequality, but because it is hidden a lot of the time with coded language (Substituting terms describing racial identity with seemingly race-neutral terms that disguise explicit and/or implicit racial animus), think 'real Canadians' , New Canadians', think Dog Whistle politics¬†https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog-whistle_politics. Sociologists and Psychologists talk about 'Aversive' RACISM¬†https://psychology.iresearchnet.com/social-psychology/prejudice/aversive-racism/¬†¬† ¬†or to quote ""A critical aspect of the aversive racism framework is the conflict between positive aspects of people‚Äôs conscious attitudes, involving the denial of personal prejudice, and underlying unconscious negative feelings toward, and beliefs about, particular minority groups."" Another reason why talking about RACISM for some people is so touchy is because they actually are RACISTS, and any discussion or¬†critical¬†analysis about it threatens the status quo from which they benefit. When I went to University for my History/Sociology degree I remember at first feeling like it was all a bunch of bull, and while it sounded good, it had no practical use for me other than occupying my time and helping me to not relapse into drug/alcohol abuse (¬†I was pretty much fresh out of rehab at that point back in 1998). I¬†remember going to my Sociology lecturer's office and having a tantrum, I was struggling with all these new concepts, and as it was new, it was frightening, confusing and I just wanted it to go away...lol. I put it to him that while he got a good salary out of it, what was in it for me? I'll never forget his answer as long as I live, he said that if it did nothing else for me, it would at least help me to 'challenge common sense assumptions about the world we live in"".¬†I was still pissed at him and unconvinced when I left the office but his words stuck to me like glue. Fast forward 20 years and I can say that despite a shaky start the lecturer and me are friends to this day and his words proved very true and useful. Why do I question common sense assumptions, including my own? Because they are anything but 'common' or 'universal' truths. A couple of examples. We arrived in Canada in the winter, so I had never experienced forest fire's before.¬†My first trip fishing to Lac Seul that summer in a boat and i'm smelling woodsmoke, I turn to my buddy and say that there must be a lot of people on shore having BBQs that day, I was so embarrassed and felt so dumb, but from my experience my common sense informed me it was that and¬†not forest¬†fires. Another happened when I was responding to one of the replies in this post last night, I found myself about to refer to a lawyer that someone mentioned as 'He' when I did not know the gender of that person, my common sense telling me one thing, the reality possibly different.¬†Those¬†were¬†personal experiences and¬†now a hypothetical one, imagine how common sense would manifest differently for a person of colour and a white person if they were walking down the road by themselves turned a corner and were confronted by a group of white nationalists on the march, if it was me I would be inclined to run, for a white person far less a threat, common sense telling one to get the hell out of there and another common sense reaction being 'i'm probably safe'. Chris you said that if your house was on fire you would want an army of 6'6"" young musclemen to come to your family's rescue and¬†that they not be gay or female and that your preference is based on and informed by 'common sense'. This seems reasonable, on the surface. In fact discrimination often hides itself by claims of reasonableness, I mean who wouldn't want their family to be rescued by 'the best',¬†that's¬†reasonable right? But there is a gulf between that reasonable common sense and reality. Last time I looked at our local firefighting team not one measured in at 6'6"", and there is one¬†woman in that group and she aint the shortest. So the idea that you are getting to get what is a cross between a homoerotic fantasy and a Bridgette jones daydream climbing the ladder to rescue just isn't the case. To say that even if you could get what you wanted but somehow if one of those strapping ¬†6 footers¬†preferred sex with men would mean they were less intelligent or physically able is also just not based in fact, and if as you claim RACE would not mean someone was inferior to someone else how do you come to the conclusion that sexual¬†preference does make you inferior to others? I'm also¬†disappointed that someone who¬†considers me a friend would be so flippant about offending someone else, you obviously know what you said was sexist and offensive as you draw our attention to the fact, I was brought up to respect people's differences and¬†avoid making judgements about them based on those differences precisely because it is offensive."

1052925,Old Ironmaker,2019-11-23 10:11:00,8243,"I always thought the same thing, exactly. We had a few women working in the Blast Furnace operations years ago. Oh my Lord! Then it hit me. I was doing a Confined Space pre job meeting and one of our guys that tipped the scales at a buck 50 was the ""rescue man."" One of the Millwrights in the confined space went around 300 lbs. How is this man going to carry Bob the Millwright up a ladder if he goes down. He isn't carrying anyone up that ladder. No one is, man or woman. I watched. very closely how our Ladies were doing working on the cast house floor doing the job along side our tough Ironmakers. Back in the 80's we were still doing the job the way it was done in the 60's. I noticed how these women starting to work smart and not hard. Fast forward 10 years. All salary jobs had to be posted across the company, no matter what job. More than 1 woman applied for a few front line supervisors positions as a Furnace Blower, stop, it's the tradition name for the guy that runs a furnace. Like a Meltor or head Roller. HR called me to a meeting and asked if I thought women were suited to do the job. To their amazement I said of course they can. I wouldn't expect them to lift one end of a 300 lb blowpipe up 3 feet onto the bosh level of a furnace, of course not. But they are smart enough to use the tow motor that is sitting there doing nothing to do it. Does it take longer, of course but it's the safest and smartest way to do that 1 job for example. In the same way a woman may not be the right Firefighter to run into a burning building to carry out a 300 pound man, just like a 150lb Firefighter isn't able to, or not many 6'6"" hulks can Fireman carry a 300 lb victim either. By the way Chris I've worked out way back when with a few members of the LGBGTATSN community and more than a few could bench 400lbs. And a few were pro athletes, including our sacred national sport. Who cares, I didn't and that's when you could get AIDS from the shower floor.¬† q Cisco I love reading your stuff, keep it coming. I'm starting to get it. I didn't know there was such a thing as The Human Rights Code that says we are to only speak one language in Canada, would that be English or French? Yes I'm being facetious. Simon I shook my head when I read the dreaded ""R"" for racism too. To keep to the subject for once, why do we only wear Poppy's for a few days every November?"

But having some experience with the way old people speak I simply feel his remark was that of¬†an old gentleman who was getting worked up as he spoke about his seeing less poppies out there. As LA even said we don't know what is in his mind. My opinion is he was chastising everyone but¬†his focus fogged a bit as he strayed to justify his stance by including many recent arrivals from places such as Syria or Iraq where media is drubbing into all of us that it's lucky they got here away from refugee camps and tyrant killers who took over their homeland. IMHO he was using the best example in his aged grasp to get all of us to realize what we have here that the fallen sacrificed their lives for.¬†I vaguely recall the first thing I thought about after hearing his exact words on TV was a colleague who came here as a Syrian refuge who explained how she and her family were lucky to be here alive. So his remark hit home by reminding me how good we all have it here. He strayed in a direction where his evidence served as bad but true example of why we all should wear poppies. So he had a rant where he chose a true but bad piece of evidence of why we all should wear a poppy and donate to the Legion. He instead could have singled out a crippled soldier he met someplace to drive the point home but instead his old mind chose an example that was derisive. Nobody can tell me he was aiming only at immigrants. Anyone who knows what Cherry stands for knows he was giving everyone heck. Why he strayed into that example? Who knows. But I have witnessed¬†seniors I know countless times when they are on a heated subject and spew examples that are a bit 'off'. When I try and correct them I get ""You know what I mean!"" It's all part of the aging process IMHO and to be forgiven even if not understood. Others around often whisper this kind of thing to me ""She/he's ........92."" Forgive and forget. Don't search for a rope and the nearest tree and don't attack as a 'hater'. We all experience discrimination in our lives. Some certainly worse than others. However this is Canada folks where we are not supposed to bludgeon the aged every time they make a poor choice of words."

It‚Äôs interesting how people are racist these days. If I don‚Äôt say Black but use other ways of saying it I then have plausible deniability. I can say it‚Äôs not about race, or race is not an issue and claim the universality of human experience and then turn things upside down and say because the accuser of racism talked about skin colour they are in fact the racist. What is the purpose of this? To shut down the conversation and neutralise any argument that racism exists and maintain the status quo, a status quo in which there is a huge power imbalance that benefits one group and denies others purely on the basis of skin color. I remember as a kid I was stopped by the police and asked for my immigration documents! I had a broad English accent then as now, why did the cop assume I was not from England? This still happens today, coded language is key. I get asked all the time, where are you from? You tell the person and the reply is, ‚Äú no, I mean where are you really/ originally from?‚Äù These are just examples of frequent reoccurring microaggressions experienced by people of color, we are well aware of the ways in which racism manifests without saying black, brown etc.. etc. Being reminded daily of one‚Äôs ‚Äòotherness‚Äô is the¬†commonly shared experience of people of colour, of course if you don‚Äôt experience this it might be hard to see or believe it is the reality for some, to be told that my actual experience and my actual identity don‚Äôt exist and I only believe it because I‚Äôm a ‚Äú snowflake‚Äù is just insult to injury."

Nothing more than luck that I was born to my parents and not another set of parents. Many of the people immigrating have experienced war firsthand, and live with the memories every day. I'm not going to fault someone coming from a situation I know nothing about for either not being aware of the meaning of a poppy, or choosing not to wear it because they just came from war and choose not to relive it. I was born here, I'm certainly aware of how pivotal our veterans were in Canada BEING such a great country, so I'll wear a poppy every year and make sure I donate a reasonable sum to the poppy box when I purchase one. I mean, if you want to get mad about something, get mad at people who pull into a store in a high end Range Rover and drop a quarter into the box.

A 2nd cousin that lost his life when shot down on a sortie in a RAF bomber over Germany in 42' was never given the chance to wear a Poppy, he never made it home. My Grand Father that took shrapnel to his scull fighting for The British during WW1 never wore a Poppy, he was an immigrant from Italy that volunteered to fight then later in life was interned in Camp Petawawa as an enemy of the King¬† in 39', Grape's can add him to his¬† list.

Our senior staff that may have never seen a PC up until then said they would fire anyone doing that. I asked if they have ever fired anyone for reading a newspaper or looking at a Playboy magazine up until then? Like HTHM says here, ""Oh look, a can of worms lets open it."" It is under Ontario labour law potentially a dismissible offence, I have never heard of anyone within my circle (which is very small now) that has even been disciplined for it. To completely digress, of course, I recently learned that one of my Engineer trainees in the early 90's that I failed on his 1st bout of operational training has been named Vice-President. What did I know? I'm cringing."

If you take his words for what he said, there really isn't anything malicious being said. The end result was him telling ""you people"" to buy poppies. But the more you look at it and take a critical thinking approach to those words, the easier it is to realize that yes, that phrase could very easily be racist or discriminatory. The end result is an 85 year old hockey analyst that should have retired long ago¬†and is by and far behind the times when it comes to the current type of game played here has been fired. his tenure 0on coaches corner had to come to an end sooner or later and they will replace him and life will go on.  On a secondary note, I saw another post saying that Coaches Corner is pre taped and played 3 times (once per each game played). And no one at Sportsnet thought ""Maybe this is a little over the top and we should re tape this segment?""... So although he said it and is wearing the blame, there are multiple other people who let it go by that could have stopped this from being an issue in the first place. I rarely watch Hockey anymore so don't really care one way or another."

They also lost about 74,000 men in those fights, more than the Canadians lost. They also sell poppies and women's Hanjab's with poppies in them to support the troups.

Chesterton Hundreds of thousands of Canadian soldiers have given their lives in the last century for ""you people"" to live in this great country. On November 11th we pay tribute to their sacrifice and remember the soldiers who made our freedom; including the freedom of speech, possible. It is because of them that ""you people"" can write whatever it is you wish on social media, it is because of them ""you people"" are free to express and follow whichever religion, sexuality, belief or ideal you choose to; free of persecution. On November 9th 2019 Don Cherry spoke the words: ""You people... you love our way of life, you love our milk and honey, at least you can pay a couple bucks for a poppy or something like that. These guys paid for your way of life that you enjoy in Canada, these guys paid the biggest price."" He is not wrong. The words ""you people"" don't translate to ""immigrants"" in my vocabulary. But it did for the tens of thousands who brought their complaints to the attention of SportsNet and multiple social media platforms. ""You people"" to me represents ANYONE who enjoys the freedom we are given in Canada without a second thought about the cost of that freedom. ""You people"" targets those with a total disregard for how we pay our respects to our servicemen. Don Cherry was not disrespecting Canadian soldiers of different ethnicities. His comment was directed to ANYONE purposefully not wearing a poppy but enjoying the freedoms our country provides. However, if you were one of the humans who got offended and saw it as ""racist"" or ""xenophobic"" all I can say is... ....if the skate fits, go ahead and lace that b*tch up and wear it. We have a Prime Minister who openly mocks minorities with countless ""black face"" party tricks. He has discriminated against and disgraced women in his cabinet and breaks promise after promise to our aboriginal population. But a true Canadian PATRIOT rather un-gently encourages the public to wear poppies in remembrance of veteran sacrifice and he is fired from an iconic career. I ask anyone who was offended by Don Cherry's words to walk down to your local Legion right now and ask a veteran why they did what they did. When the vet is finished explaining, I want you to explain to them why Don Cherry's words offended you personally. You won't. ""You people"" will have no way to justify your easily offended feelings after hearing a vets selfless response of why they risked their own life for our country and the freedom ""you people"" take for granted. ""You people"" owe every Canadian veteran your life, but because of their sacrifice your life will likely never be called for collection. The least ""you people"" could do is give them your respect."

1052278,grimsbylander,2019-11-12 07:24:00,3016,Agreed.
1052281,misfish,2019-11-12 10:28:00,29133,YOU PEOPLE You and you and you and you and ME.  YOU PEOPLE  Warm milk and honey. Great stuff.  The greatest D man you will ever see.
1052283,Yellow Fever,2019-11-12 11:46:00,139,Sorry....you crossed the line there....
1052285,Squid,2019-11-12 12:09:00,1656,Glad that he is gone. He is anti-immigrant and pro white so bye bye. Canada is all¬† inclusive and if you cannot get behind that then get in line behind cherry and show your true colors.

1052288,dave524,2019-11-12 13:12:00,4508,He number 7 üëç¬†on the list of the most admired Canadians¬† and that list is quite lib/left biased as David Suzuki and Pierre Trudeau are above him.
1052289,wkrp,2019-11-12 13:34:00,656,Just think of all the kids that play and watch hockey and¬†hang off every word¬† this man has to say. Not a very good example in my mind.
1052290,Oggie,2019-11-12 13:35:00,588,He was blunt that's for sure but the scary part is I can't figure out why people find what he said racist??¬† As an old guy I think'll just refrain from saying anything these days. He didn't try to assign reasons for the lack of poppies; he just made an observation.
