If you don't have to travel you might want to stay home now as the weather is turning again. But with the rain that has now turned back on in Lindsay you will want to get out and clear your driveways! I have already done so twice since I got home 2 hours ago (give or take 30 min) and it is HEAVY due to the rain mixed in the snow. Do it in small batches and save your back if you have to because if you wait till tomorrow, good freaking luck as it's that heavy already."
