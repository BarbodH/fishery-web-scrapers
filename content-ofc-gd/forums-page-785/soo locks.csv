385282,Dara,2009-09-20 22:17:00,3052,"I was out to the mouth at Lake George  Thursday and Friday night for an hour or so. Got a 20"" eye the first night. It was cloudy and blowing up pretty good. Friday I was marking so many fish top water that I tied on a Xrap cloun that you guys have been talking about. I was tidying up the boat so the rod was in the holder. Not 3 minutes it starts to bouncing. Fish gone before I got to it. So, I just left it there. 2 minutes later it starts to bouncing again and line peeling out. Great, a King on my little GLumis and 2000 Diawa. I played for about 15 minutes and landed one tired King about 15 lbs. I was alone in the boat too so it was extra interesting."

385543,Dara,2009-09-21 18:19:00,3052," Go out the back door of the hotel, 100' to the water. You never know what you will catch. Salmon and eyes all through there. You are also quite close to the rapids."
385603,Kinger,2009-09-21 20:41:00,351,"I got one last night, great fighter. Should have seen the look on this old guy's face as I quickly revived and released the fish. ""You're Not gonna EAT that""?  Going down tonight since it rained.  "
