I realize that the best tool to learn is to get out there with people who know what they are doing and I'm doing that.  The problem is that everyone I hunt with are ""old school"" hunters who don't use computers.  I would like to continue to learn on my own during my down time to quench my thirst for knowledge.  Can you please give me a list of your top 3 sites that I can peruse to learn more about the wonderful world of hunting?  Thank you very much in advance!"
