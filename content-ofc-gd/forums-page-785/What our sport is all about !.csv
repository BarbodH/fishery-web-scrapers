385393,irishfield,2009-09-21 04:44:00,26272,"..fish are just a bonus in the grand scheme of things!!  Thanks for the week of laughs Lloyd, you know I truely needed it.  Hopefully I'll find time in the next few weeks to get some summer adventures posted.... especially our ""football"" adventure.  "
385424,Fish Farmer,2009-09-21 12:04:00,2234,Nothing better than good friends with an open ear Wayne
385454,Joey,2009-09-21 14:06:00,9122,Nice post Wayne.  Too true!!   You sure that fire is big enough to cook them weenies  Glad you're back.  Joey
385476,johnnyb,2009-09-21 15:30:00,3413,Was wondering when you'd pop up again   Howdy!
385482,LeXXington,2009-09-21 15:49:00,1928,YEAP
385495,Bernie,2009-09-21 16:13:00,3190,"Love the weekends ""fishing with the guys"" reports.  Lots of good times. Good to see you back too Wayne."
385550,Leecher,2009-09-21 18:36:00,7832,Great report and pics Wayne Definitely what fishing with friends is all about  Looks like your little piece of paradise!!! Thanks for sharing Leechman
385552,irishfield,2009-09-21 18:39:00,26272,First picture is a stocked speck lake we had good results in during the winter... nadda from shore though after walking the portage into it. The second picture of a spot we flew into and fished from the canoe.... the lake shall remain forever nameless! (but we'll be back.. over and over and over again! )
385553,Headhunter,2009-09-21 18:41:00,5703,I think I know that lake in the 1st pic! Surprised that fire is still going! Nice to have you back Wanye... any idea how to repair some aluminum?LMAO! HH
385571,JohnF,2009-09-21 19:40:00,3494, Dunna what the big deal is. Doesn't everyone have a floatplane kickin' around for impromptu flyins?  JF
385586,irishfield,2009-09-21 19:58:00,26272,"Issue with many of these ""back"" lakes in the Temagami area John is no matter what the huggers say... there are roads EVERYWHERE!"
385591,Terry,2009-09-21 20:05:00,14456,"yeah that's Lloyd always fishing or eating  sounds like you 2 had fun...... at lest no slush to get stuck in ,on that back lake"
385635,JohnF,2009-09-21 22:00:00,3494," Yeah, but why share a fireroad with the bears & the skunks?  Seems to me a floatplane is the epitome of fishing chic.  JF"
385639,bigbuck,2009-09-21 22:06:00,2449,Nice!!! The little back lakes have the potential to be walleye factories that's for sure!!
385644,Roy,2009-09-21 22:25:00,13728,Sounds like a nice relaxing time there Wayne. Glad you guys were able to get out and away from some stressful periods.
385708,fishhunter,2009-09-22 01:33:00,604,"Wayne I think we should show some of the football game we played, And yes we will be going back as long as you can fly and I can see them under the plane lol"
385723,irishfield,2009-09-22 01:54:00,26272,Here's me as quarter back... lol
385724,splashhopper,2009-09-22 02:00:00,2931, That last  pic looks like you use a float plane for a TROLLING MOTOR
385725,Terry,2009-09-22 02:02:00,14456,wow that is a football
385726,irishfield,2009-09-22 02:02:00,26272,"We were actually packing up and getting ready to put the canoe back on the airplane when Lloyd said ""grab a rod and drop the bait in between the floats"". 2 monsters hiding in the shade of the airplane."
385775,ccmtcanada,2009-09-22 07:20:00,7971,Carole has been keeping me updated Wayne...you needed a week just like that!!! Glad to hear you had a great time and it was just what you needed...been a tough summer for you and Leah...
385787,MCTFisher9120,2009-09-22 11:18:00,3761,"Agreed, fished with some friends a few times this year. Too bad that those trips are the trip that end the soonest."
385795,Ron,2009-09-22 12:07:00,1683,"Talking to Lloyd, he said teh pair of ya had a great time. Good on ya's."
385858,tonyb,2009-09-22 14:55:00,1637,Looks like a good time surrounded by some OK scenery hehe  Have you made any further modifications to the boat holster? getting better at deploying and stowing?
385860,irishfield,2009-09-22 14:58:00,26272,Working like a charm as is Tony. It's 5 times easier to load and unload on the water than it was in the hangar on jack stands.
