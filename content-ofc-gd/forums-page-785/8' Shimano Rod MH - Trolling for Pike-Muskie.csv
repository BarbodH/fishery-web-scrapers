Its an 8 ft MH shimano rod and I've paired it with a size 30 rapala reel .  It just seems way to big? I am going to be using big lures though...  I am not looking for the perfect setup, just wondrnig if I can get by with it?"

385539,BillM,2009-09-21 18:11:00,17367,To big?  It might be to small  I love my 8' Heavy action Compre..  Works perfectly.
385557,mistaredone,2009-09-21 18:49:00,913,I have a 7'6 MH compre that I use for every situation and love it.
385714,bucktail,2009-09-22 01:43:00,1857,Perfect rod! Rod makers are finally moving to longer rods and away from the short pool cues!

385768,camillj,2009-09-22 05:47:00,1988,"Not too big at all .. one of my favourite rods of all time was a 9' fenwick rigger stick .. which I used for Salmon, Musky, Trout ... you name it ... it had backbone for 30lb test and yet was supple enough to handle 12 lb test too  For my money a longer rod for trolling is better suited (big quarry) and allows you to work a fish around things - especially in a bigger boat"
