Hours Fishing: 1.5  Fish Landed: 6  Largest Fish: 12"" Rainbow  #1 Mepps Aglia Spinner Silver Hooks Dressed in Black all the way!!!     Only got a couple pics of the Atlantic Salmon Smolts (at first i thought they were browns). The Rainbow was hooked badly so I just worried about getting him back in the water alive and didn't worry about getting out the camera and all that maddness.       Yes there quite small but the antisipation of getting that 18"" plus brown is priceless."

385332,ADB,2009-09-21 00:44:00,444,"Are you being serious, Bill?"
385334,BillM,2009-09-21 00:50:00,17367," Yup...  I got fooled by the same fish on most likely the same river, until a buddy pointed out the differences..  "
385344,timmeh,2009-09-21 01:16:00,609,"I agree those are Atlantics; red spots mostly along the lateral line, and the mouth does not go past the eye (which is the case in browns)."
385348,laszlo,2009-09-21 01:27:00,487,Cool. My first Atlantics. I did think they were browns. Do they stay in the river or eventually swim into the lake?
385358,BillM,2009-09-21 01:40:00,17367,"I'm pretty sure they are in the rivers for at least a couple years before venturing out in the lake, although one of the CRAA guys could answer this better then I can.  If I'm not mistaken, there is also no open season on Atlantics except for in Lake O (Zone 20)"
