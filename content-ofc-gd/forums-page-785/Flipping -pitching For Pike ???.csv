385253,Fishing 24/7,2009-09-20 21:10:00,709,Well me and my cousin went out for some fall Large Mouth bass.  What better technique than flipping the edges and the logs and the drop offs.  well the bass was dead but the pike was alive.  we caught 3-4 of them of the FLIP!!  Here is the best of the day a nice 9 lbs pike!      Black and bleu trailler on a black and bleu jig......      BYE BYE!  till next time mr. pike.  and a big congrats to ryan on his best pike this year!  who would have known on the FLIP of all things...
385259,Terry,2009-09-20 21:20:00,14456,"Oh sure let the secret out   many days, pike will hit a a jig while not even giving other bait a second look it's one of my best and favorite ways to get them on Cooks Bay"

385446,Mike Pike,2009-09-21 13:51:00,1332,Can't imagine what it was like when you set the hook on those gators at such close quarters.  Wow!
385458,fish-miester,2009-09-21 14:13:00,864,when i was up in north addington area.. aka lake mazina / skootamata lake etc i caught probably 6 pike that way .. but nothing over 3-4lbs
385487,Dabluz,2009-09-21 16:01:00,701,"No bass of any kind in my region but there are lots of pike.  I almost always fish pike as if I was fishing largemouth bass.  I stay away from heavy jigs but I do pinch on a big split shot in front or on the shank of a huge hook that I embed in a huge plastic bait.  The only very large plastic baits that I can find are 6 to 10 inch curly tails.  Since the diameter of the curly tails is large, I slice grooves in the plastic so that the point of the hook (rigged weedless) is easily exposed when I strike the pike.  This is the time of the year when only pike fishing is still open in the back lakes in my area."
385504,chandru,2009-09-21 16:28:00,63,wow nice ive found almost everytime im trying to hit bass i get pike using bass spinners and buzzbaits in the evening. i love those topwater strikes!
385528,Guest Johnny Bass,2009-09-21 17:51:00,0,Nice pike. I have hit quite a few pike on jig and pigs. I hooked a 6-7 lber my last time out. I have also hooked musky on a jig and pig. Thanks for sharing.
