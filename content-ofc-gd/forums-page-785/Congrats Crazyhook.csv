382362,jediangler,2009-09-12 01:45:00,1923,"Good luck Jamie, I just wish I could get WFN  ."
382375,darsky,2009-09-12 02:21:00,586,wooops-my bad.
382440,Marc Thorpe,2009-09-12 10:47:00,621,"How many times has he been suspended from OFC ??????? Not counting other sites  wow ,from internet troll to TV Star  Hope they are gonna use your handle ""Jamie Rhomo Pistilli""  Very cool,now I can pick on you   We need Hawgwobbler back on OFC  congrats man "
382455,Weeds,2009-09-12 13:30:00,782,Congrats. Sounds like it would be interesting but I'd hate to see my favourite Musky from shore spots on TV. We're all pretty tight lipped around here (on the internet at least) about revealing any of our honey holes for fear of them being swamped by lurkers. I can only imagine the increased fishing pressure profiling exact locations on TV would bring. I know Fishing Canada gives GPS points but most of their destinations are remote and/or you'd need a boat to get to them. The more I think about it the less I like the idea really; I'd probably watch the show but it seems potentially damaging to the resource. Just my 2.
382456,mrdylan,2009-09-12 13:36:00,111,Congrats. Sounds like I will be watching this for sure.

382926,Guest gbfisher,2009-09-14 13:07:00,0,New Shows are good. Nice catch the Jamie.
382973,fishingisliving,2009-09-14 15:46:00,170,"You should showcase your talent for embedding fishing hooks in your skin. Every episode, you should embed a hook in a different part of your body and show viewers how to remove it. :-)   I wish I had the time to ""properly"" photoshop some pictures of you...   maybe a little later.   I've already told you, but Congrats again bud!!!  cheesy pistachio pictures with gay overtones, coming soon!"
383104,Harrison,2009-09-14 22:06:00,2202,"Great to hear, good luck with it!"

After seeing this which he posted shows some toughness as well. http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/index.p...c=31247&hl=   Jamie has come a long way from posting photoshopped pictures of ChrisS. That was pretty funny stuff.
