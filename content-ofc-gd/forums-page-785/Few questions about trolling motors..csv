It would be kind of tight to add a trolling motor to the front of the boat and a bit messy so my question to you great guys:   Would a trolling motor work efficiently at the back of the boat beside the main motor?  I've heard Minn-Kotas are the best so I'm looking into one, but how much thrust would I need to push my boat around nicely (40-60 pounds?)  Where should I buy batteries and a charger for my trolling motor?   I'm kind of new to boating so I appreciate all the information guys. Thanks alot"
385655,redneck666,2009-09-21 22:45:00,563,"well im a relatively new boater too, but i know what im talkin about! lol. you should get a 40 pound thrust minnkota with a deep cycle battery (a normal car battery will turn to junk a whole lot faster than a deep cycle).... just when your motoring across the lake be sure to pull your motor in unlike ""worm dangler"" (a fellow OFC'er) who forgot to and smacked it off a rock and it went flying and was never able to retrieve it.... lmao!  but a 60 pound would be a good investment too.

385658,Aaron`,2009-09-21 22:49:00,25,Sounds cool haha. Thanks.
385661,Pigeontroller,2009-09-21 22:52:00,2793,"An electric motor will ""pull"" a boat(bow mount) much better than ""push a boat(transom mount)  40 lb thrust might be a bit small for a 16 foot boat, the largest thrust before going to 2 batteries(24 volts) is 55 lbs.  I have a 55 lb on my 16 foot aluminum, its ok on flat water but much wind or current and it struggles..."
385669,splashhopper,2009-09-21 23:13:00,2931,an excellent link about trolling motors for you >>  http://www.fishingandboats.com/trolling-motors.html
385670,Aaron`,2009-09-21 23:18:00,25,"Appreciate it everyone, thanks for the link hopefully this well help me out."
385672,danbouck,2009-09-21 23:28:00,4380, Yep I have a 55 too and have issues in the wind. I would at least go with a 55 for that.  I had a 45 for my 14'er and it was OK
385674,redneck666,2009-09-21 23:39:00,563,fine then how about a 220lb thrust then eh? haha
385675,danbouck,2009-09-21 23:48:00,4380, That's called a 2 horse   (roughly)
