385497,Bernie,2009-09-21 16:16:00,3190,Hope you end up OK there Glen. We are expecting a needed rain here but hopefully nothing like you are experiencing.
385499,highdrifter,2009-09-21 16:18:00,2534,While you're at it..  I'm still waiting for my Sabiki Rigs!!!
385555,Leecher,2009-09-21 18:42:00,7832,Man that's some serious rain fall Hope all the work you did on your yard doesn't get flush away by this rain  You mind as well make jigs Glen while that storm goes by.... not much you can do about it Jacques
385558,Roy,2009-09-21 18:51:00,13728,Just looked at an interactive map for your area...it don't look too good at all. Is your property saturated enough that it no longer absorbs rainfall?
385559,Dara,2009-09-21 19:05:00,3052,"So...can we assume that ""you're all wet"" ?"
385572,Greencoachdog,2009-09-21 19:41:00,8163," We're fine Bernie! Flood plain level is elevation 472 here, I believe my lot is 485.    Where's your Dixie cup?    The yard wont wash much Jacques... but I wouldn't advise walking on any of the tilled spots, I'd have to pull you out with the 4x4 Ford!    The ground stopped absorbing water a few days ago Roy.  "
