385582,Leecher,2009-09-21 19:54:00,7832," Thanks corvette1!!!  It sure was   Thanks Glen!!!  Yeah the cold front sure put a damper on the bite but we still got into a few of them   Thanks Greg!!!  It sure is not normal for the temps to drop that low mid September.... but slow presentation was key in getting some stikes and want to thank you for that tip   Thanks Roy!!!   Thanks tightline!!! Once filleted, dropped them into the pan and they were real good   Thanks Dusky!!!   Thanks JP!!!  Trolling is another productive way but still prefer jigging for them"
385585,redneck666,2009-09-21 19:58:00,563,"i would too if i actually caught one by jigging, haha."
385249,Leecher,2009-09-20 21:08:00,7832,"The mission today was for Paul and I to head over to Lac St-Marie early morning til noonish to see if we could entice some eyes to hit our jigs.  Hadn't had a good feed of eyes for some time now and was really looking forward to it  Got up early and when I looked out the window..... this is what the reading on the thermometer was    2C Shock!!! Man talk about change of plan.... had to bring extra clothing for this trip     The good thing was, there was no wind.... Perfect!!!  Left home at 5:00am as usual, pit stop to Tims and the way we go.... Got to destination at around 6:15ish, launched to boat and proceeded to our favorite spot in the fog    Surface temp was 64.4F, positioned the boat and started drifting.... here's a pic of where we started    This area is a big weedy flat with some variation in water depth.... 10' to 15' is what you will find here with some underwater holes that reach to 30'  Didn't take long for Paul to land this beauty.... just over the slot size 12"" and change    Little one but was our first...  In the live well it goes...  Kept working the flats and got this pic of Paul working hard at it....    We did manage a few more but they were under the slot so back they went in a hurry  We then tried to work around the closest island and found a weedy hump.... on the hump was around 9' fow and on the one side dropping into 15'.... this is where I landed my biggest of the day.... a 19""er Here is the pic    We kept working the new found spot and got reward again with a 13""er    At around 12:30pm we called it a day..... All in all, we ended up catching 6 eyes and keeping 3.  Got into a few SMB's, perch and rock bass while jigging.  Lure of choice was a 1/4oz chartreuse jig dressed with a twister tail, tipped with a worm. Won't be the biggest feed but at least will be able to taste some Thanks Paul for an awesome time!!! Will have to do it again soon Hope you enjoy! Leechman"
