A lot of them this year look thin to me.  That was how Georgian Bay started about 3 years ago when the few salmon caught were really skinny.  Then the population crashed.  From those that fish Lake O, are they thinner this year?"

All the Kings I've seen caught from Credit/Bronte/Niagara have been thick, but lampreys are definitely on the rise in the last few seasons."
