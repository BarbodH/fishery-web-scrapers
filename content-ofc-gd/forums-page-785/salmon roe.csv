This works well, no eggs are lost and you can knot it and water harden them in the stream and drain them all in the stocking. At home I will mix up a solution of boracic acid powder and water. Boracic acid can be found at the drug store, it is commonly used as a eye wash. It is also used as an antiseptic and to treat yeast and fungal infection, so your eggs are free of anything nasty that might grow and ruin them. Run the eggs in the boracic powder solution for a few minutes and drain them in a collander till they are dry. Next I put them into quart sealers , the kind with the snap lid, guess you could swish some of the solution around in them too to kill any nasties. Fill the jars to about an inch of the top, then lay a piece of aluminum foil over the eggs, take a small piece of paper and light it , drop it on top of the foil and quickly put the lid on and ring. If done correctly the flame will burn off the air generate some heat and when it cools the lid will snap, sealing it. That's it, use your eggs and do the lit paper and snap lid thing every time you use some. I found that they will stay good in just the fridge this way all winter and till the end of spring fishing.  We got one of those expensive vacuum bag sealers lately, the ones with the real heavyweight  bags. It has too levels of suction. One flattens a beer can so that it resembles a road kill, the other is for softer foods . Going to try it for a few bags this year and see how it does on the lesser setting.  EDIT: I would still do the boracic wash to sterilize them and only refrigerate the bags. Nothing will grow on them if there is nothing to grow.  Don't ask about the nylons in the back of my vest"
