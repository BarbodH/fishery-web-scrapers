Friday I decided to head out to Pancake lake as it would be the easiest to and out as I didnt have too much day light.  I also wanted to see if I could find my lost Rod and reel.  No Luck for that.    What a beautiful peaceful night.  Oh yea, and the fishing.    I never even got a nibble.  But what the heck.  I'm alone and away from work.  Its so Quiet, except for nature.  I can hear fish jumping inside the reeds.      It seems to really get dark fast once the sun is behind the trees     No rods missing on this trip.  I broke them down before going through the reeds    This time I put yellow reflective tape on the top of my Cart and faced it so I can see it in the dark.  You can see it in the center of the picture    The next day I decided to go to Hackett lake with my big boat, the 15 Honda.  It was windy and I needed to get the gas out of the outboard before storing it.  Probably my last time with this boat for the season.  Notice the Ontario invasive species sticker.  Yea bought the boat and motor when I lived in Wasaga beach a couple of years ago.    Pike was biting on the trolling.  I stopped for some still fishing and managed a few small pike and a small walleye that I ate for a late supper.  It was slow.    I got a feeling with all the leaves on the ground, the open season will be numbered."
