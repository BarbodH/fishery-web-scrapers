Had promised some good fishing and the old lake did not dissappoint. Only thing is the father in law is the original Archie Bunker, complains about everything.....and he is the first person i've been with on Lac Seul to complain about the fishing!!!  We had to laugh, he was getting stressed about having to throw back all the 21"" - 28"" fish we were catching. I kept telling him that we would get our limit of keeper size and to shut up whining...relax, and enjoy catching some big walleye whilst slowly reaching our limit....lol...but i think he just likes whinging...strangely enough it is what i like about him most...its very entertaining. We did keep 3 overslot size fish just to keep him quiet in the end...something i dont like to do normally....why kill a big breeding brute when you'll geta small one eventually...and even if ya dont...you can always come back.   Anyway.....first reef we went to was very slow.   Second spot took 20 mins to locate the side of the reef the fish were on....we then anchored up and the bite was on fire. All were using 3/8 ounce jigs and minnows....we had a couple dozen 5""/6"" sucker minnows too which were popular with the big walters.....also popular with Jackfish too unfortunately.   The fish were hugging so close to bottom you could not see any on the graph.,but with the anchor down you could watch your jig go down and entice them up off the bottom.   Here's a few pics vids from our afternoon.   ASSORTED VIDEO CLIPS FROM THE AFTERNOON    UNCLE DUANE WITH A LITTLE BASS         ANOTHER KEEPER COMING TO THE BOAT        COUPLE NICE ONES         WAS SAVING THE BIGGEST SUCKER MINNOW FOR A HOG WALLEYE, BUT NOBODY TOLD THIS LILE GUY THAT!         DAD INLAW WITH FISH.  "
