I was gonna be near his neck of the woods and he offered to show me a few places for salmon on ""his river"".  Although we didn't get in to any this time, I am sure we will next time when I follow up on his offer to give it another try.  I especially appreciated how he kept an eye on me when we were crossing back over the river in the dark with no head lamps.  I didn't get my board name by accident   .  Splashhopper"
