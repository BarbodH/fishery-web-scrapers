385021,curlrap,2009-09-20 00:37:00,58,I think that TJ should give Randy a few hats and T-shirts for that plug on youtube. He doesn't have a sponsor but he sure has balls showing that on the internet. Very funny stuff Randy!!

383985,PikeMolester,2009-09-16 23:06:00,428,the acting job of setting the hook when the fish was on before the camera was on is hilarious

383990,Muskieman,2009-09-16 23:14:00,2472,"  The fish bit and stole my leech ... I re-leeched and dropped it down as I was pressing the button. it bit again when i closed the bail ...  I have 2 more of these little vids .. where I press the ""R"" button just after the bite.. 13 walleye in 1 1/2 hours ... all about the same size   except for the ones I brought home.   RFS "
