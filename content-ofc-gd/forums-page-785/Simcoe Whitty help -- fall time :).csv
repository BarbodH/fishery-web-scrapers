Being that it took me about 3 years to get a whitty on the ice I was thinking about trying the same area of the Fishing for Tyler on the water.  Is it worth trying in the area for whittes or should I skip that and go for the perch, bass pike etc..  Any help you can provide for fall whitties would really be helpful if they are in that area.  Thanks"

385507,LeXXington,2009-09-21 16:38:00,1928,"Well the Results are in..  Started of Sunday early morning.. Fog bank so think I cut it and ate it for breakfast. I waited around till about 7:30 light enough too see a couple hundred feet then off I went GPS in hand.  Got too where I thought they would be, it was dead calm so jigging was easy.  yes the whitties were there and intrested on what I was offering but they decided too just window shop. Coming in close then leaving. I think if I tried a few more days (years   I could have caugh one.  After the fog lifted and the sun poked through I tried to find some bass, nope,, tried some pike,, nope..  On the way to another spot I started seeing lots of activity at 50feet..  Spent the rest of the afternoon perching..  The perch schools were only in the 55-48 foot mark if you drifted too shallow the perch seemed to dissappear.  Got a bunch of jumbo's and only a few dinks most were around 7-9 inch mark.  The fish were very aggressive, your bait would not even hit the floor, I tried using a high low rig but just too tough.  it will be hard to get that type of day on the water again but it was fun. Cheer's too all the tips I got,  I was in the right location but wrong bait"
