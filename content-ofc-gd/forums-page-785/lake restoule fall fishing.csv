I have heard stories of good size musky and I was going to wait until next summer to fish them (since it would be the first time and I thought I would start fresh).  Then, this past weekend I was fishing in a small bay, I thought the electric motor hit a log (which was weird because I didn't see any prior to the bump),  I looked down at the motor I saw a 3-4 footer swimming away to the depths.  Now, whether it was a musky or a big pike, it has made me want to catch something other than a small mouth.  Now I will be up at the lake once more probably early in october and I have always seen people nailing musky in the fall so I figure I have to give it a try when I head up there.  I have the rods and reels but I'm lacking the big plugs.  So does anyone have recommendations on lures (preferably topwater), or should I use live bait??  If anyone could give me some tips to target these monsters in the fall that would also be great!"
