384590,bigbuck,2009-09-18 17:26:00,2449,"I've got the boat at home this weekend from G-Bay and I was wondering if there are any concrete ramps that are public or marina owned in the Kawartha's, especially Pigeon or Buckhorn lakes. My van is front wheel drive and I'll have a heck of a time trying to pull the boat out on a gravel ramp. Thanks in advance guys.  B"

384633,Pigeontroller,2009-09-18 20:16:00,2793,"The launch in Bobcaygeon is solid, north side of the river right between Riverside Lodge and Gordon Yacht Club."
384657,dada2727,2009-09-18 21:29:00,108,"the launch at nogies creek on pigeon is paved now with asphalt, if that helps"
384689,Garry2Rs,2009-09-18 22:51:00,1425,"Dutch Harbour Marine in Bridgenorth has a free concrete ramp. You would be launching into Chemong, but would have access to Upper Buckhorn and Pigeon without going through a Locke."
384696,Jer,2009-09-18 22:59:00,1426,"The Emerald Isle Bass tourny is this weekend with 120 boats, so parking might be a problem at many of the ramps on Chemong or Buckhorn."
384699,Bondar,2009-09-18 23:09:00,817,Gannons narrows ramp is nice at the marina concrete and good docks
384868,Garnet,2009-09-19 14:38:00,2056,"Ran in to a guy with your problem, couldn't get out of ramp. After a little conversation I convinced him to try a little weight on his front tires. We opened his hood an set 2 25lb anchors  on flat spots I didn't even push out he went.  Garnet"
385457,bigbuck,2009-09-21 14:12:00,2449,"I actually used the ramp in Bobcaygeon between Gordon Yacht Club and Riverside Lodge, only problem was that the shoal just past the bridge was not marked and I bounced off of a rock and trashed my prop. I spent the summer boating in Georgian Bay with it's gazillions of rocks and I end up hitting one in the Kawartha's. Anyways, it's always smart to keep a spare prop on the boat along with the necessary tools, otherwise, I would have ended up heading back home. The fishing was so so, we caught a few smallies and tons of slab rock bass, and sunfish. No walleye and more importantly for myself, no muskie."
385505,Pigeontroller,2009-09-21 16:32:00,2793,That shoal just past the bridge is as well marked as it gets! The trick is to stay between the channel markers!
385637,bigbuck,2009-09-21 22:03:00,2449,"Unfortunately for me, the markers for the shoal were removed just after Labour Day weekend. I had no warning, all of a sudden the water went very shallow and before I could pop it into neutral, I hit a rock and mangled my prop."
385642,Dara,2009-09-21 22:12:00,3052,  Thats covered in the boating exam right?
385700,Tom McCutcheon,2009-09-22 01:01:00,627,"I can't believe that the markers were removed so early. The locks are still open to navigation until thanksgiving. I live on Pigeon Lake and the levels are reduced after Thanksgiving by the Trent Severn Waterway Commission and the markers are removed by the Ministry of Transport or Coast Guard. I will check them out my next trip up the lake, and let everyone know. You never know someone may have decided to save some kids salary and layed them off early."
385704,dada2727,2009-09-22 01:15:00,108,  Who puts this tourney on?  Is it another leauge like the CSFL and Top Bass?
385705,Dutch,2009-09-22 01:22:00,831,I think the Emerald Isle tourney is privately run.  The tournament is fairly highly regarded and there is usually a waiting list.  It attracts a lot of great anglers.
385784,Jer,2009-09-22 11:14:00,1426,"Like Dutch said, it's a privately run tourney (I believe by the marina itself) but very well attended."
