383734,Skud,2009-09-16 04:46:00,739,That sure is a great start and it's only going to get better. Keep us updated on your success.

383779,chandru,2009-09-16 12:41:00,63,Beautiful fish! Must have given you a work out!
383781,tonyb,2009-09-16 12:46:00,1637,"Congrats on the catch! It has been really tough fishing from the boat, let alone the piers.  That's a great reward for the long hours usually put in from the piers, enjoy it bud!  Tony"
383831,Leecher,2009-09-16 14:38:00,7832,That's a real nice salmon Mark   and caught from shore.... Awesome Great job and thanks for sharing Leechman
383836,Jet,2009-09-16 14:51:00,364,Nice catch man. Been trying my luck at the piers on and off for the past few weeks with no luck. Glad to see you found them.
383866,lucabrasi,2009-09-16 16:45:00,114,"WTG! It's definitely been slim pickings so far, i've only managed one myself. Nice going, hopefully more to come."
383869,rylan,2009-09-16 16:49:00,134,Sorry -- was this caught in Port Hope?????
383878,bubbles,2009-09-16 17:23:00,591,"Nice fish, well done."
383908,12footspringbok,2009-09-16 19:18:00,459,"Exellence! Have to start calling them salmon the fish of a thousand casts. I know i've put my time casting in this fall, well worth it though."
383929,CLofchik,2009-09-16 20:20:00,854," Lol   :lol:  :lol:   It's definitely been a hard scratch season in the west end, atleast that fish still looks fairly fresh.  Every one I've seen this week have been sliding towards the ""boot"" category."
383931,BrownTown,2009-09-16 20:25:00,103,"Nice going, looks mid morning/mid day when you were fishing? Ever think to get out late at night or early morning?"
385373,spinnerdoc,2009-09-21 02:25:00,556,"a little off topic,  recognized you by your pic, you were at the board walk last sat and i noticed the guy you are talking to had 2 rods/lines on the water. hope you are not buddies with this poacher,."
385385,Ziki,2009-09-21 03:28:00,128, But was he sitting in an inflatable boat?
385447,pikehunter,2009-09-21 13:51:00,1659,Nice!   Thanks for the evidence to prove that there are actually some fish out there.
