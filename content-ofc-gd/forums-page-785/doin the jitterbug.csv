Feeling that my bass itch hadn't quite been scratched, I decided to make a pit stop in my hometown where I spent many late evenings as a kid fishing topwater.  After a few huge Rocky's, small smallies and a small battle with two beavers to hold my position, I was rewarded.    Not the fattest I've ever caught, but 22"" and what an explosion of aerials this fish put up!  The card in my left hand is my OFC Team#8 Bernie's Bandits, but never showed on the flash.  Richard Elliott Jr., probably has it beat anyway."

385627,Radnine,2009-09-21 21:48:00,1538, Of course we'll take your word for it. Anyone from team 8 is an upstanding individual who's integrity is beyond reproach. Jim
385693,GBW,2009-09-22 00:41:00,8460,nice bass for sure AND it wasn't a jitterbug as those things are garbage  so it must have been a buzzbait....
