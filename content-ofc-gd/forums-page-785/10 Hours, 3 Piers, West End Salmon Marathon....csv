Hell only saw one fish landed last night/morning, the West end of Lake O has not been kind this year, 4 damn fish shouldn't even be a good night let alone season.  Meh chinny mojos hez weft meh   "

Caught one right off the bat, but...recap of MY last 3 outings at Bronte: 12 Hours Fished, One Boat, No Competition for good spots, 0 fish on, 0 fish landed.. awful.. a complete waste of gas money..  My Salmon season in the West end is done for this year.."
385226,Twocoda,2009-09-20 19:25:00,4130,remedy for skunk removal :  original  sinking shad rap rotated with silver canadian wiggler with a hint of scent  Luck has nothin to do with it
385333,CLofchik,2009-09-21 00:46:00,854," Nah, I can catch them in a boat it's the damn piers that are snubbing me!   Well the casting range on the Shad Raps are shall we say limited, and I can't think of a better camouflage at night than chrome.  Appreciate the sentiments but I think I have a fairly good handle on bait selections, it's just rough when you've been at something so long you like to think you know what you're doing, then get a solid drubbing over & over again.  Aaargh back at it again in the morning, can't let the fish win!  Atleast I haven't seen anyone else doing that great either."
