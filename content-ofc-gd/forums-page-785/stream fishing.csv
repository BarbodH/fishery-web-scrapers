385646,Roy,2009-09-21 22:28:00,13728,"It would seem to me that the farther up a trib one goes, the more tight lipped the salmon get. Let's not even mention how rotten they get but what do I know......"
385648,danbouck,2009-09-21 22:31:00,4380,Stoty???  Same sponsors???
385656,StoneFly,2009-09-21 22:47:00,574,"you should check the regulations,...this is the only way to esnure your own piece of mind that you are fishing within the law.   Actually I have read that salmon can travel 30-40km or more in 24 hours in the river.  When it is high and the obstruction is minimal, I dont doubt it.  I have witnessed Chromish salmon nearly 100km up river a few days after a particularly heavy rainfall."
