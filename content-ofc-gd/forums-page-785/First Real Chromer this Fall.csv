385374,BillM,2009-09-21 02:26:00,17367, You offered me a $100 to PM you the name of the GBay trib you fished?  You sure you wanna lose $100?  You aren't the only one that hikes for fish.

385388,StoneFly,2009-09-21 03:35:00,574," No doubt,...Lol...I went back this Eve as my buddy bugged the crap outta me,...we hit every hole with everything,.. Salmon roe, Steel roe,..flies, pink worms.... and 2lb 4' leaders to boot,....it was a fluke,...best I came close to today, in the exact same hole was this nice Resi,,...altho for the first 2 seconds I thought it was DejaVu...  The Water was Soooo GinClear, I saw the bottom of holes I have never seen the bottom of before.....I got really stupid and daring with the structure also...lol...but still...Rain,..Damit..lol  "

384889,StoneFly,2009-09-19 17:24:00,574,"Out hunting nookies this morning, not many around, so I decided to try one of my honey Steelhead holes, sure enough a couple were hanging out.  Must have come in a couple weeks ago when the water was up.  This is nowhere near any river mouth either.  Not huge, 23"" by 12"" around 4lbs,..but Dang was it ever fun.      "
