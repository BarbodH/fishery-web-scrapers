384983,Greencoachdog,2009-09-19 22:55:00,8163,"Dat's a killer Pike for shore!!!... and a helluva first fish!!!  Did it release?... or was it a keeper?  Can't blame a ""cherry buster"" like that if it was kept!"
384985,pike slayer,2009-09-19 23:05:00,1177,"ya he kept it, i asked him if he wanted to release it or bring it home and hes like KEEP IT! dinner tonight!! it was his fish so its his choice, i gotta teach him the value of selective harvest! i filleted it for him and his family is eating to it night. we also stopped at a tackle shop in town that is doing a fish derby and we entered him in it and hes currently in first place for pike with the derby closing on the 25th, i hope he wins, he'll get a brand new rod and reel!"
384986,Greencoachdog,2009-09-19 23:10:00,8163,"That's great!!! He got to keep it and show it off a little, and will now have several nice meals from it!!!... not a darn thing in the world wrong with that!  Since it's his first fish ever, it's not like he's decimating the population eh!"
384988,MCTFisher9120,2009-09-19 23:21:00,3761,"I can see keeping your first fish if the person is younger but it's my guess that that fish was either released dead or was put into the pan. Nice job on the catch, how did it taste?  MTBF"
385018,Leecher,2009-09-20 00:34:00,7832,Congrats to adam on this huge snake I can see why he wanted to keep it..... being his first and a dandy one Thanks for sharing worm dangler Leechman

385096,Twocoda,2009-09-20 04:56:00,4130,just curious ...did he weigh and measure you when he caught ya ?   the jury still out as to whether you are extremely brave or dumb for fishing with him again ...lol...  congrates on the catch ....is it normal for pike derbys to allow fish entered on the same day you enter the derby?
