384907,rbaquial,2009-09-19 18:30:00,968,"Hey Fella-Addicts,  All this talk about FLUOROCARBON LEADER had me thinking - What brand do you prefer to use? and why?  Understandably, Fluorocarbon Leader-Material has its time and place; Especially when it comes to species. Just wanted to get a general idea on what most of you addicts out there use - and why.  Thanks for your input! Look forward to seeing the days results... A2F (RoB)"
384908,StoneFly,2009-09-19 18:35:00,574,"You should add Drennan to the List, ...although it is made by raven, it is better than the raven brand.  Not sure who makes Frog's hair, but that is pretty popular also.  Assuming we are talking about Leaders for Steelheading."
384912,rbaquial,2009-09-19 19:00:00,968, Leaders for ANY SPECIES... really.
384916,Greencoachdog,2009-09-19 19:06:00,8163,"I chose Seaguar and Suffix because I get excellent results from them.  If you want to buy the crappiest fluoro on the market, pick up a spool of the Yo-Zuri and try it!!!"
384927,rbaquial,2009-09-19 20:16:00,968, Yeah? OH MAN - I was SO CLOSE to getting some Yo-Zuri FLM awhile back - glad I didn't!!
384942,KelfuN,2009-09-19 20:59:00,246,"p-line fluoroclear 10lb for bass, walleye fishing. siglon FC 6lb for steelheads in frog water. maxima ultragreen (no fluoro) 3-5lb for normal steelhead fishing."
384949,Garry2Rs,2009-09-19 21:14:00,1425,"This year I have been using Seaguar Red, which is a new reel line, not a leader line. I have to say, I am not totally convinced that Fluoro leaders really do anything worth while.  I have been using 20 pound mono and 15 pound Fluoro for Cranks and 6 pound Fluoro for drop-shot and weightless worms.  I tried long leaders, 6 to 12 feet, but switched to down to 3 foot ones because they cast more easily. Over the winter I will spool-up some BPS fluorocarbon while I'm down south. I suspect that it is actually made by Sufix, which is one of the biggest line makers in the world."

385181,Fishnwire,2009-09-20 15:41:00,983,"This was the first year I used flouro leaders.  I tried Seaguar, liked it, but have never used any other brand, so what do I know?  I like about a two foot leader of 12lb flouro tied to my 8lb Fireline with a small, good quality, swivel for SMB and even walleye.  I prefer a swivel to a knot for connecting the flouro to the braid because it helps reduce line twist and I'm no good at tying a surgeon or blood knot.  I was resistant to try a flouro leader (as apposed to sraight braid) because I was worried the overall breaking strength would go down a lot but I have found it really doesn't.  That stuff is pretty tough and the knot strenght is good.  For big pike I use 20lb Fireline and a steel leader though.  I still don't trust anything but steel against a big, toothy pike.  My Father-in-law refused to jump on the flouro bandwagon this year and stuck with straight braid.  There were a couple of days when I lost track of how many fish I caught, and he got skunked or nearly skunked.  I can't contibute that entirely to the flouro leaders (he's got a couple fishing ""issues"") but I'm sure that stuff makes a difference.  One more thing.  When attempting to ""walk"" a surface bait such as a Zara spook, I have found that the tiny weight of the swivel acting as a pivot point a foot or two away from the bait really helps the side to side action of the walker.  Try it sometime."
385200,Twocoda,2009-09-20 17:37:00,4130,I use Maxima to increase the fishes chance of survival...lol...im not a fan of frogs hair cuz i dont want to give them that much of a chance
385205,River Rat,2009-09-20 17:46:00,161,"Scientific anglers Mastery series for slow water, Drennan for fast  SA 1. the most abrasion resitance I have seen in flouro 2. rated properly, unlike many other more supple lines like frog hair...7.2lb breaks at around 8lb....frog hair 7lb breaks closer to 5.6lb 3. very supple, no memory....for lite bugs under float in frog water, it hangs straight 4. It's coated slick, so it doesn't go dull after a while like many others do  Drennan 1. strong like rope....8lb breaks like 10lb 2. holds a knot very well 3. cheeper than SA 4. has some memory and is stiff but for runns and faster stuff, it doesn't matter  RR"
385311,MJL,2009-09-20 23:57:00,2427,My fluorocarbon hierarchy for steelhead leaders (4-10lb)  Tops in my books - Drennan - Seaguar - P-line - Scientific Anglers  I've had good and bad experiences with these: - Maxima FC - Siglon - Raven  I'd rather use 20lb mono in gin clear water before I used it (I never had a good experience with these): - Berkley Vanish - Froghair  The cheap red-wing tackle fluorocarbon has really impressed me this season.  It's my first season of trying it out and so far so good.  At $9 it looks like it's great value for the money.  Will probably go another season with it before fully recommending it to anyone though.
385359,dada2727,2009-09-21 01:41:00,108,"I like using the 20lb vanish leader material for flipping and pitching.  Find the braid wears down quick especially on the rocks, while the leader lasts much longer.  never had a breakoff at the uni to uni yet.  Just had a couple at the jig end.  If you take the time to tie and dress your knots properly and keep inspecting them, It's very rare you'll get broke off with 50 lb braid and 20 lb floro leader.  And the invisibility factor doesn't hurt, but I mainly use it for the abrasion resistance."
385397,floatman_mike,2009-09-21 05:17:00,14,"i have used raven, seguar, and drennan.  Raven and seguar and my top 2 absolutely bulletproof for me.  Now lets talk about the exact same lb rated drennan, ABSOLUTE CRAP. Someone just posted that Berkley vanish is bad, for years i have used vanish with my MOST Success. Drennen is absolutely garbage I have never landed a fish with it and will never buy it again or recommend it. Done deal."
385400,ohhenrygsr,2009-09-21 06:15:00,947, That's exactly what i use.  I love the Sufix Elite so smooth. for braid i use power pro to Seagar Abrazx
385467,Hellfish,2009-09-21 14:56:00,308,"I like the gamma for bottom bouncing, seems you could pull a log out with that stuff"
385468,BillM,2009-09-21 14:59:00,17367,"I used to run Raven 5.6lb until I was broken off 4-5 times without reason.  Got rid of it all, currently running Maxima flouro or Maxima ultragreen 6lb if the conditions call for it.  Going to be loading on some Drennan Super Specialist Super Mono 8lb for my mainline this year, I've heard it's the bomb."
385472,kemper,2009-09-21 15:13:00,2232,"Maxima Ultragreen non flouro or bust.  I bought two types of flouro and gave up on both of them. Tried the redwing stuff and it was garbage and tried froghair and it was the most useless crap I have ever seen. Couldnt turn a fish, couldnt hold a knot, couldnt take a hookset.  The UG is super strong, I run 10 lb mainline and 5 lb Maxima UG and I get broke off rarely enough that  I can't think of a specific time in the last season."

385484,Dabluz,2009-09-21 15:53:00,701,"I'm in the same boat as a bunch of others.  I've tried Vanish main line and leader material and Seaguar leader material.  Both were very disappointing.  However, I'm sure that there is better stuff on the market.  Maybe I might get an idea of what to buy the next time after this thread has petered out."
