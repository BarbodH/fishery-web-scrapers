382751,Joey,2009-09-13 21:28:00,9122,Me thinks someone forgot their fish  Bon Appetite Bernie  Joey
382784,kickingfrog,2009-09-13 23:18:00,8333,"I wonder where along the road home he had the ""head-slap"" moment?  They were probably all bass anyway."
382798,Bernie,2009-09-13 23:59:00,3190,"Joey. A little potato salad on the side and a tall cool one (a Joe Special mixture- thanks Joe!). mmmmmm!  KF he probably won't think of it until he sees this.  We did catch quite a few bass this weekend while targeting pickerel- they were voracious. But the pickerel were biting, all in all a very good weekend.     "
382799,Gerritt,2009-09-14 00:08:00,6129,ARGH!!!!...  There was a slap in the head moment in Gravenhurst! too far to turn back LOL!  We thought Joe grabbed em... Ahhh well.... thanks for posting the pics to prove I actually was fishing! LOL  another great weekend B.. see you in a few months!  G
382802,Bernie,2009-09-14 00:13:00,3190,I could mail them down to ya G but they may end up with a little more odor to them.  O ya the pics have a little smudge on the lens. Must have been a little febreze overspray?
382819,Daplumma,2009-09-14 01:17:00,1961,Thats a damn shame G.Eat em up Bernie! Joe
382920,Headhunter,2009-09-14 12:47:00,5703,"Hey Bernie! Thanks again for yet another excellent weekend! Yes, Gravenhurst was the head slapper! Sorry G! I thought you had taken care of your fish.

Already lookin forward to cutting some holes in the ice with ya in February! FishnSled has some pics I'm sure he'll post... HH  PS...Baaaaaaaaaaa   Baaaaaaaaaaa"
382988,Bernie,2009-09-14 16:54:00,3190,"You looked like you were in fine spirits yesterday Joe, the rest of the guys looked a little worn.    O ya, the sheep noise thing Joe mentioned earlier? It's fishing related--really!"
382995,Headhunter,2009-09-14 17:27:00,5703,"Well Bernie: - Gerritt was busy trying to forget his fish, which tired him out! - Terry was trying to come up with an excuse that could net him more time, say a week or two, up at your place. - Will was trying to figure out if he had enough Fabreeze to clean out the rest of the boat or if he was going to have to stop and pick up some more on the way home... The boys had alot on their minds! ... and very few function brain cells... MISSION ACCOMPLISHED!LOL HH"
383098,Daplumma,2009-09-14 21:45:00,1961,Does that count against your possesion limit Bernie?You better eat them quick. Joe
383245,fishnsled,2009-09-15 02:19:00,3520,"Bernie - Thanks again for your great hospitality. Simply an EPIC weekend!!! Didn't get a chance to say goodbye so I'll save that till the next time we meet. BTW - I think that might be Febreze on the lens....  Joe and Gerritt, a pleasure as always. Too bad I didn't get to meet Bill's Mom but maybe the next time. Terry, nice to have met you and I'm sure we'll see you again.  Just a fantastic weekend was had by all. Stellar weather, good friends and the fishing was very good as well.  No PB's for anyone this trip but some nice fish were caught. This was one of 2 silvery blue walleye that I caught, more detailed shot of the colour further down. According to Bernie's Dad they all use to be this colour until they lake need to be stocked and the yellows were introduced.   This was my biggest of the trip 64cm.   Out for the evening bite. Bernie and his motley crew.        Joe thought winter was coming and felt the need for his survival jacket.    Here another ""blue""    You can see the blueish tint to the scales here.    A beautiful Nippissing sunset.      The last fish of our trip Joe managed this beauty, apparently we weren't suppose to catch him were we did....     Thanks for the great times, the laughs and the memories guys! Till the next time."
383373,Bernie,2009-09-15 12:27:00,3190,There are no evening pictures. No one could hold the camera straight.
383492,Headhunter,2009-09-15 18:32:00,5703,We couldn't take pics... our offical photogragher was on a plane to Lebanon! HH
383564,Gerritt,2009-09-15 22:34:00,6129,Anyone else see the dolphin?      Love the new Sig line Joe!
383776,Headhunter,2009-09-16 12:28:00,5703,"I neglected to mention earlier and I'm sure many of you are wondering, but yes, hair styling in the above was provided by our good friends at Mercury! HH"
383820,fishnsled,2009-09-16 14:15:00,3520, I'm thinking more like a killer whale.  Love these pics G.  Joe - Mercury is an expensive hair designer you know.  Can't get that style just anywhere...
383827,Headhunter,2009-09-16 14:32:00,5703,"Oh, your right Will... my only question being, would I have a finer coiff had we been running a four stroke instead of a two stroke? HH"
383858,Bernie,2009-09-16 16:29:00,3190,Not sure about the dolphin but I think I see the handle of the net.
383859,fishnsled,2009-09-16 16:32:00,3520, What happens at Bernie's stay's at Bernie's but since you brought it up.....
385387,irishfield,2009-09-21 03:33:00,26272,Is it time Joe ?
385481,Headhunter,2009-09-21 15:47:00,5703,When isn't it time Wayne! LOL HH
