662229,Cosmos,2012-01-31 16:31:00,588,I am wondering if somebody can share experience using ice fishing rods from Simax.  thank you
662278,EC1,2012-01-31 20:24:00,930,"I own the MH 28"" rod and have handled the UL and ML. I think it's got a much better bend than any of the st croixs. I have no clue what the blank is in terms of sensitivity, but I haven't had any problems with feeling the bite yet. I like mine and will buy another one the next time I get a rod. (Hopefully I won't get another one this season... I don't need anymore rods )  I know that the softwater rods are one of the best in terms of splining for the best bend. (Go and take a look at some rods the next time you go to a tackle store.  BTW, splining is because any rod bends best only in 1 direction. Placing your guides along that will produce good bends, while ones that are not on the spline do not bend anywhere near as well as ones that are. On a rod that isn't splined, there should be some torque/twisting on the rod when a load is on the rod. (Not to bash on high end rods, but sometimes their QC decides not to check the spline and you end up with a rod that isn't as good as it could be)"
662540,frozen-fire,2012-02-01 18:57:00,542,I also have the MH... picked it up late last year and I think I've landed a few whities and a laker with it. Great rod for the price. It's now my go-to Simcoe deep water rod. Wish I could use it this year.

662739,peter23,2012-02-02 03:12:00,95,"have the 32 inch ML it is amazing, one of the best rods i have seen in a while."
662818,Homer Is King,2012-02-02 13:14:00,305," That's good to hear!!  I am a little worried about the small eyelets.  They are very small, ice up might be an issue..."
662823,Cosmos,2012-02-02 13:23:00,588,"That's my concern as well. I own couple of rods with small eyelets, and there is a big issue with ice build up everytime you are reeling lure out."
