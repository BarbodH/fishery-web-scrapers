660257,johnnyb,2012-01-25 19:29:00,3413,That's a report and a half!!  The specks and lakers had beautiful markings...wow!  Also the first time I've seen a fish caught on one of those soft plastic Storm jigging lures LOL
660270,corvette1,2012-01-25 20:22:00,1765,awesome report congrats
660494,TDunn,2012-01-26 03:59:00,680," Nice, you noticed the wildeye! I just ordered 20 packs of them. It was a lure I had in my box for a few seasons before I gave them a good go. As soon as I started catching fish on them, I find out they are discontinued. Even to our surprise, they have been one of the best lures for my friends and I over the last 2-3 winters for brookies/lakers through the ice. Both those lakers were caught on wildeyes also....  TDunn"
660529,MCTFisher9120,2012-01-26 12:05:00,3761,Nice report and pic's!  Thanks for sharing
660738,COUNTRYBOY,2012-01-26 20:13:00,130,"NICE REPORT, NICE FISH, JELOUS...NO..I'M NOT"
660858,Moosebunk,2012-01-27 00:18:00,3970,"TD... two things man,  One... Wicked fishing.  Love the bow/bridge pics and the specks.  Two... I'm not sure if those are whitefish.  Seriously!  They all kinda look like ciscoes (herring) to me.  If they are whiteys I must be losing it. lol."
660970,TDunn,2012-01-27 05:17:00,680,  Ya man all whities except for a few menominee in the one pic above the deer! Thanks for the kind words!  TDunn
660972,danc,2012-01-27 05:25:00,4677,Awesome report Tyler. The deep colors on the Brookies are great. It's also nice to hear that bottom bouncing still works. I cut my teeth bottom bouncing. Glad to hear that it's not a lost art.
661439,SHINNY,2012-01-28 17:42:00,39,"that one fish, was it a atlantic slamon?"
661633,TDunn,2012-01-29 04:34:00,680, I'm glad you appreciate it Dan. I love to float but there is a few places where bouncing is hands down the best method. The best steelheader I know won't ever put a float on.     Yes it was   TDunn
661815,NAC,2012-01-30 01:10:00,369,Love it! Looking forward to the spring trip.
661826,Whitespinnerbait,2012-01-30 01:36:00,2038,Talk about a Phenomenal Report right here !! right now !!  :worthy:
662812,Spiel,2012-02-02 12:56:00,9065,"Outstanding fishing, outstanding report, thanks Tyler."
659961,TDunn,2012-01-24 22:12:00,680,"Hey Guys!  It has to be the better part of a month or more since I have posted a report. With the extended steelhead season this year, I was able to fish quite comfortably into the new year. Not very often are we able to enjoy the best of both worlds up here. Jan 11 was actually the last day I did the trek down to the rapids.  Typically, I fished for 2 hours( 3-5pm)  and had steady action on pretty much each trip. Fish were all nice too! Most were silver bullets in the 5-6 pound range with two fish that would have measured out  over 30"". All were caught bouncing bottom.         Even had a few of these hanging around      Most of the shots as you just seen were just quick while I was tailing the fish. Itâ€™s impossible to do anything else when your fishing solo in fast, waist deep water. Although I did freeze my hands a few times for some underwater release footage.  VIDEO 1 VIDEO 2   My cousin joined me on one trip and I was able to get a pic of my last fish of 2011!      Release Video  Our ice fishing season was way behind this year as I'm sure everyone has or is experiencing. I didn't get out on the ice until a day or two before xmas. Since then I have been spending most of my time chasing whities on Superior for the smoker.             Also hit a perch spot one afternoon on Superior for some deep fried eats!         I have only taken one day trip with my 2 cousins into Lake Superior Provincial Park. First lake we hit was our favourite speck pond. No wall hangers have come from this spot yet but the action is second to none. They are a blast on ultra light to med-light rods with 4-6 pound test. It was a good day with about 20 fish between us 3. All fished released.                  Video Brookie 1  Brookie 2   Really cool underwater brookie video  The second lake was about 20 minutes....uphill and then straight down in the snowshoes. Lakers were the target. We fished for about 2- 2.5 hours at two locations with a couple fish landed but nothing spectacular.        Back up the cliff for a quick session on the speck lake before we left.        Last weekend I was invited to do a day trip with a couple buddies. After a descent snow machine ride we found ourselves fishing on top of a reef that tops out at 30ft  with 100 ft of water off the one side. Perfect area for big lakers we thought. Well we caught a half dozen lakers but nothing over 20"". Had a our chances but we all choked...LOL On the other hand we had dynamite action on the whitefish. We lost more than we landed but it was wicked fun on the flashers. On the way home we hit a lake for some eyes and tried a new spot nobody had ever fished. Slow at the start but once the sun hit the trees the dinner bell rang. We iced 8-9 eyes in the last half hour before dark.  Mike with the best eye (27"") of the evening which was sent right back down the hole it came from!   The Mess   The guys had a big fish fry/party after which I was unfortunately unable to attend.  Brutal...  Anyways good luck to everyone on the ice this year! Hope you enjoyed,  TDunn"
659966,J-M,2012-01-24 22:15:00,65,"Oh man, what a report! A nice variety of species - some monster perch in that one pic! Well done man."
659969,LesCulpJr,2012-01-24 22:20:00,75,Nice!
659970,BillM,2012-01-24 22:21:00,17367,"Tyler, I'm extremely jealous of you right now, lol!!!  I can't imagine ice fishing Superior, that would be a riot!"
659971,Joey,2012-01-24 22:22:00,9122,Just Stupendous
659973,davey buoy,2012-01-24 22:24:00,5505,"Some of those fish colors are amazing,looks like some great outings!"
659978,kingofthesteelhead,2012-01-24 22:34:00,140,"wow looks like a great area with lots of fishing options,gorgeous fish to boot."
659979,WeedLine,2012-01-24 22:40:00,322,Looks like you've been busy. Great report and pics. Those specks are something else
659980,misfish,2012-01-24 22:48:00,29133,One word      SWEET.
659982,Roy,2012-01-24 22:51:00,13728,"Love your reports, Tyler! Great pics, videos and written report. And those specks...WOW! Thanks for taking the time."
660029,Wolf 3,2012-01-25 00:42:00,134,"Wow, great report."
660032,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-01-25 00:49:00,0,those specs/lakers look familiar i've always attributed the colour on the specs in that lake to all those tiny salamanders we have found in their bellies.  i know of no other lake with fish that colour.  at least i know where there's a trail broken!! sweet report!
660037,asdve23rveavwa,2012-01-25 01:00:00,2690,Absolutely spectacular.  I truly look forward to your reports.  Hopefully we don't have to wait as long for the next one
660055,cjgraham,2012-01-25 02:16:00,104,Jan 11th was my last day in the rapids as well. I think I may have seen you. Love the late season in there all hogs in beautiful winter colours! Awesome report!
660079,spinnerdoc,2012-01-25 03:02:00,556,"The colors on those specks are unreal Tyler, Awesome report as always man"
660106,Twocoda,2012-01-25 04:50:00,4130,your welcome...... for giving you the opportunity to spend the hours of fishing/filming and reporting to make me feel inadaquite....seriously dude...you suck
660107,Jet,2012-01-25 05:21:00,364,Another awesome report Tyler! Love seeing the variety of species.
660108,TDunn,2012-01-25 05:43:00,680," Ya man! It can be awesome! But I will admit to having some very long days out there of nothing too.... If guys are into catching/eating whitefish it is a great place to fish. Lots of bays just off highway 17 with easy access,lots of fish around, not much pressure (except for one bay) and a big limit for those looking for some meat.....12 fish... Wax worms, micro tear drops, and an ultra lite is the norm for the whities on the big lake around here.    Haha I even waited a few extra days to see if you would break trail first! Any thoughts on why they seem to max out at 17-18"" inches in that lake/pond?  A big thanks to everyone for the kind words!  TDunn"
660109,highdrifter,2012-01-25 05:58:00,2534,That's some eye candy!!  cheers
660110,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-01-25 07:17:00,0," Definitely never caught anything big there although we've had some pretty epic days number wise. If you're looking for bigger specks, I'd be fishing the lake you caught the lake trout on."
660114,wormdunker,2012-01-25 09:48:00,1711,I wanna be your best friend!  What's your phone #?  Beauty fish!  Was this all in one day?
660119,spincast,2012-01-25 10:18:00,3279,"Another great report - thanks Tyler. Almost, makes me want to go visit the in-laws. almost  "
660201,Rod Caster,2012-01-25 16:43:00,5784,Oye! Grown man shedding a tear here.  The red on those specs is unique for sure. Very deep and rich color. I'll have to send you a PM the next time I'm on the 17 corridor.. I'd love to get into some whities.
660235,Leecher,2012-01-25 17:50:00,7832,Excellent multi species report Tyler Loved the dark red color on those specks
660239,troutologist,2012-01-25 18:20:00,951,Nice fish Tyler! Ya those specks from that small watershed are very unique...miss those snowshoe treks.
