I thought it was gonna be a tough year for ice fishing, but, although the temps are still hovering around zero, we have lots of safe ice.  I drilled 6 holes last night, as I had time to fish for a few hours. I tried various spots, just checking the thickness. I had 22"" near the current, and about 25"" in the slack areas.  We had planned to have a few people join me last night. So I went early and got things set up, since we were short on time. Weather network said clear skies and it was about +3.  After getting set up and wetting two lines, I couldn't find any takers. Tried a few different plastics and spoons, but still couldn't locate any active fish. After an hour, I gotta text saying everyone else backed out. Bummer. But I'm already out, so I'm gonna keep fishing .  Just around dark, I could see some clouds rolling in. Never though much of it, as those clouds often look darker than they actually are with dimming light. Turns out that was a mistake, lol.  Within 5 minutes, it was pitch black and snowing so hard I had a hard time even finding the shoreline! Good thing I was close to home and know the area.  Caught 6 little walleyes one after another, right as the storm approached. All under 10"" though, but at least I got some bites.  I'm heading out again tonight for a few more hours. Hopefully the fish will co-operate"

And it's been very mild, so I was surprised the ice was that thick.  Here is a pic of last night. A few minutes before the storm, and then during the storm...  before     after    "
