One guy uses a float reel and rifle to subdue his catch. (51:46)  If you are interested in trapping, fishing, hunting, buscraft etc. this is worth a watch. The trappers in the movie do some incredible stuff. (Travelling upstream in big canoes loaded with a snowmobile)  Werner Herzog is a famous german filmaker and this film is one of his personal favourites.  If you liked the Dick Proennekke movies (Alone in the Wilderness I and II) you will appreciate this movie.  Enjoy   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V26jauHZgtw"
