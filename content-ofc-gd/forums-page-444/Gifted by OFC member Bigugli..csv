A short while later he arrives with his lovely wife and procedes to hand me a bag of perch fillets and some of his home made salsa, lucky me.  Looks like a big fish dinner for me and the kids tomorrow. Can't thank you enough for your generousity Bruce.  It was great to see you again and have a chat with you and your wife, you now know where I live, doors always open!"
