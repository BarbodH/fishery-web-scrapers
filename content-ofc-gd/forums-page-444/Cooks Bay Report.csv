663147,bobowski,2012-02-03 09:12:00,360,I got out to Cooks Bay yesterday to fish for some Perch. The ice was in good shape. I fished on about 7-8 inches of ice about 1km from shore. I fish for about 4 hours and caught around 100 fish including a nice sized Cisco that went right back down the hole. The bite was steady all day and the fish are biting anything. I caught a lot of small fish but I managed to keep about 15 fish measuring from 8-11 inches for a nice snack.
