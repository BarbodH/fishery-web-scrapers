662590,uglyfish,2012-02-01 21:40:00,981," No, I mean like when he tried for the empty net instead of just getting the puck deep past the defenseman. Like I said already. But thanks for playing!"
662593,asdve23rveavwa,2012-02-01 21:41:00,2690," Nice, Colby was one of the few bright spots last year (along with Reimer). Speaking of Reimer, it would be nice to see him have a good game.  Great stretch last year, great start this year, than BANG...poor kid gets taken out, and, hasn't been the same since."
662608,jedimaster,2012-02-01 22:16:00,3472,"  Thats why wilson put him on the ice. If a guy has 2 goals and there is an empty net, he is on the ice for one reason. I doubt very much there has ever been a time where a guy with 2 goals has NOT been on the ice at some point if and where the other teams goalie gets pulled. I don't fault grabo for that one bit."
662627,mattybculp,2012-02-01 23:28:00,388,"IMHO, I actually remember watching that play and thought that he wasnt going for the empty net at all, i think on the angle he was on he was trying to get it in softly to prevent the icing and just got some bad wood on it. I said to myself after well ""he tried not to be selfish and look where it got em, if he actually went to the net for the goal he probably would got it ."" I dont know where all the hating on grabo is coming from, im not his biggest fan but we got bigger fish to fry then him. Everybody has that hate on for one certain leaf its what happens when your a die hard leaf fan ,but i would back off of grabo and start chirping the mcarthurs, kulemins, and connelly's of the leaf world. I have had a hate on for komisarek since they got em . I have no problem parting ways with schenn or kadri ."
662728,DRIFTER_016,2012-02-02 02:49:00,10439,Better get rid of Grabo quick before he accumulates any more points.
662737,Nipfisher,2012-02-02 03:04:00,2449,  At least I got the win. Good game by Reimer.
662743,cjgraham,2012-02-02 03:28:00,104,I find I watch the Leafs now and every time I am preparing for the worst. Good win tonight but they still have a long way to go
662751,danbouck,2012-02-02 03:50:00,4380,Leafs just beat the pens 5-0 in game 1 of the conference final (on my wii   )
662909,tb4me,2012-02-02 16:41:00,3295,Wow talk about a tight game lastnight..I just loved what Liles brought to the game..He is our best Dman as far as puck movement is concearned. Id rather see him with the puck in the offensive end but he is just as good in the d-end. Reimer gets the NO-NO stopping 25 shots..Leafs get 3 points in 2 games against the pens..Cant complain about that..Im thinking Reimer is the go to guy for a while again...Win and ur in!
662962,jedimaster,2012-02-02 19:34:00,3472,"Yah, hard to complaign about 3 points in a back to back with the Pens. I am a happy camper."
662993,bassmaster4,2012-02-02 21:52:00,801,edit: asked the same question as someone else before reading the rest of the posts my appologies
662397,Dan668,2012-02-01 02:56:00,1120,Yep yet again. Classic leafs
662401,bigugli,2012-02-01 03:33:00,6138,"After tonight'ss performance in the third, anyone want to change their vote?"
662404,Nipfisher,2012-02-01 03:41:00,2449,The win was on Kessel's stick in the 3rd and he WHIFFFED on it.
662463,uglyfish,2012-02-01 15:18:00,981," But yet he's one of the more solid defenseman on the team, he's still young and learning and plays quite well.  U wanna see mistakes, watch phaneuf, liles and grabovski. More giveaways then the rest of the team, missed defensive assignments and 2 games in a row now grabovski's screw ups have led to late tying goals and ultimately cost them a win last nite."
662468,asdve23rveavwa,2012-02-01 15:31:00,2690," Yet he scored two of the four goals, and, assisted on one other. I'd say it was a ""team effort"" all the way, in those last ten minutes, no sense in pointing fingers, whether it be Schenn, Phaneuf or whoever."
662471,Brettiop,2012-02-01 15:39:00,279,"Hell of a game last night, penguins have been a force and continued to be one last night...  The leafs played great most of the game, cant blame them for running into a hot team, if it wasnt for fluerys play and the blown goalie interference call, this would have been a leaf blow out....  They are now sitting in 8th, thats better then 9th people...  Id do the JVR for schenn trade in hearbeat, if JVR was playing top line minutes he would have 20 goals by now, that guy is gunna be a star..."
662472,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-02-01 15:41:00,0,the sens are a DOG?  last time i checked they are in a playoff spot.
662476,Thrilla,2012-02-01 15:44:00,164,"I voted no, as much as I would like to see it happen... They don't have the goal tending, Gustavson always looks nervous.... Reimer was the man until they gave Gustavson the reins, Reimer got back from injury he lost a couple games and they have stuck with the Monster pretty much the whole time..... bad move IMO"
662478,asdve23rveavwa,2012-02-01 15:46:00,2690,"All that really matters  8  Toronto NE 50 25 19 6 56 22 155 152 +3 14-8-4 11-11-2 3-3 5-4-1  13  Montr√©al NE 50 19 22 9 47 18 131 137 -6 9-10-7 10-12-2 1-7 4-4-2 Lost 1  Sorry, guys...couldn't resist"
662482,Brettiop,2012-02-01 15:55:00,279, The monster has been playing unreal for two months...Once Reimer shows he deserves the job back it will be his...
662484,Brettiop,2012-02-01 16:01:00,279," FLA NJ and Toronto(all within 5 point of the sens)have 3-5 games at hand over the sens, I dont see the Sens holding spot at the end of feburary, especially if this 4 game skid goes on much longer"
662495,jedimaster,2012-02-01 16:42:00,3472,"Better watch that slopes sens fans... its slippery, as a leafs fan I know it all too well. Last nights game was pretty dissapointing, but if someone asked me at the begining would I take 1 point against the pens, I would say yes in a heartbeat. It is dissapointing the way they lost but what can you do. The pens are a better team. I think one of the bright spots was Gustavson pretty much playing save for save against fleury."
662496,Acountdeleted,2012-02-01 16:54:00,2562,You could argue that the goal dissalowed by Lupal in the first should have been the game winner but there is no excuse for the lack of defensive play in the third period. When you are up 3 goals with 10 minutes left the game should be yours. I agree with the others who said that if the leafs make the playoffs it will be a quick exit. That type of play won't fly in the post season.
662497,Thrilla,2012-02-01 17:01:00,164,"Playing unreal... hardly, if he was unreal he wouldn't be letting weak goals in... If anything he is getting crap lucky with the stops he does make, so you voted they will make the playoffs? I guess we'll wait and see"
662507,uglyfish,2012-02-01 17:38:00,981," Sure he put up some points, but when ur costing ur team goals and wins, who cares when or how often u score. His first goal was all the work of his linemates, and phaneuf getting the puck and putting it on his stick for an easy tap in, 2nd goal was nice, picked the corner on a great shot, and the assit was all thanks to kulemin forcing the turnover, allowing grabovski to make an easy pass to macarthur.  So yea, he put up 3 points, but hardly from his own effort. And again, his selfishness to try for the hat trick, cost his team the win.  And fleury played a hell of a game, only reason pittsburg won it. Gustavson played well too, but his miscue on the puck cost them the 3rd goal."
662512,asdve23rveavwa,2012-02-01 17:47:00,2690," Hopefully a full 60 minute effort tonight, and, a better result.  They did play well for about 45 minutes.  Really exposed Pittsburgh's defensive flaws with speed."
662515,uglyfish,2012-02-01 17:51:00,981," Yes they did. And they're staying outta penatly trouble. First time since the 50's or so, they went a whole month without allowing a PP goal. But speed and puck movement are key for the leafs, also using their size on the forecheck to bully their opponents."
662524,Headhunter,2012-02-01 18:17:00,5703,"It pains me to say this, but I have to vote out of the playoffs.... based on current personel and their collective performance. They seem to know how to lose, but just don't know how to win... and I predict that Wilson will be gone in April, regardless of his one year extension. It was a no brainer for Burke to add the extra year to Wilson's contract... can't have a lame duck coach on a team fighting for a play off position... and the money involved in Wilson's contract is peanuts, to this oprganization. HH"
662549,manitoubass2,2012-02-01 19:22:00,11391,"Just my opinion...  The Leafs are outplaying the vast majority of teams they are playing. In almost every game, they are playing great. It's the small mistakes that they can't seem to overcome. And it seems like any mistake, the opposing team capitalizes almost every time.  Grabovski is playing a great overall game, unlike prior seasons where he seems to have three switches. 1)for scoring 2)for turning the puck over 3)for seeming to not care about the team/team mates in the locker room. Now though, he seems to have that overall game going for him and appears to not hinder the locker room.  I see two major flaws with this team. The first is goal tending. And this is why they lose almost every close game, or even games like last night. The monster is a decent second string goaltender, at this point, nothing more. And Reimer isn't healthy, even when he plays, he's constantly fighting the puck. That never works, might make for one hell of a game one night, but you'll almost never get consistency with that type of play (exceptions being Brodeur and Thomas).  The second flaw is Schenn. He hopefully has an upside as he matures, but at this point, he seems to have modeled his game to be great at turnovers and poor positional play. If you really watch him closely, even outside of those turnovers(that probably wouldn't be so bad with good goal tending), he's always out of position and being VERY soft on the puck. Watch his turnovers, he is flat out soft on the puck. He can't shoot either, so what exactly does he give the Leafs??? A possibility at becoming decent at hockey?  Lupul looks great, as does Kessel. They have many scoring chances everynight. Kadri is gonna be scary as he gains a little more experience. He's looking like a man out there lately too. And he's strong on the puck, and battling in corners. And you can see at least 2-3 times per night, he has tons of skill. Do not trade Kadri, pretty please...  The rest of the role players are playing well and contributing. Some are also exciting to watch. I loved when Brown was moving forward and stepped into that check in the corner. BOOM! Brown is a beast on the ice, and gives everything he's got, everynight.  I think the future is looking bright. Just need maybe two or three good moves for solid players, and the Leafs will be a high ranked playoff team in no time.  And as far as last night, well, Malkin... Nough said. Guy is super natural and a born winner. He literally willed that win. Thats what SUPERSTARS can do.  A few bad bounces, sure. But Malkin won that game, with a tad bit of help from Fleury, lol"
662574,Nipfisher,2012-02-01 20:59:00,2449,Leafs 4-2 tonight with an empty net goal.
662576,Raf,2012-02-01 21:10:00,3495,"save for a true #1 center (of which there are 0 available) and/or thinking they won't be able to resign a UFA, I don't believe the leafs should make any moves.  This team is young, growing and getting better and better.  We've waited how many years for a playoff appearance?  We can wait another if it doesn't happen (though I believe the current cast can make the last seed)  Don't sacrifice the future to make some run."
662579,jedimaster,2012-02-01 21:17:00,3472," That is bold. I called a split so I am going to say this one goes the distance and the leafs win in ot tonight 4-3  I am a bit worried about Reimer starting tonight though, he has been off for some time now."
662584,Jer,2012-02-01 21:24:00,1426,  ...you mean when he passed off on a 2 on 0???

662588,manitoubass2,2012-02-01 21:38:00,11391,"Leafs have Liles and Armstrong back in the lineup tonight too.  I hope Reimer can have a good game, as well as in front of him. He's good, he needs some confidence built back up."
662063,jedimaster,2012-01-30 21:31:00,3472,"Well its money time for the Leafs They have a fairyl tough scedule in Feb. Jan was supposed to be the easier part of the schedule but they sure stunk it up. TRhey have Pits Back to back this week, Ottawa, Edmonton twice, Winnipeg, Phili, Montreal, Calgary, Vancouver, Jersey, Sanjose, Washington, FLorida and chicago.  They have a few dogs, in Edmonton, Winnipeg and Ottawa...  So what say you? Are they in a playoff spot or not at the end of the month...  I am going tounfortunatly call this a bad month for the leafs and they will be out of a playoff spot by the end of Feb. I like them to split pitsburg, beat ottawa on the road as ottawa is on a back to back, win against Edmonton and Peg, lose against Phili and Mtl, sweep calgary and edmonton, lose to vancouver Jersey and sanjose, and win against wash florida, with a loss to Chicago.  Thats 8-7 for the month including Tuesdays game.I think they will be right on the edge as they are. I don't predict a major fall, but I just don't see them gaining ground with this scedule."

He also said expect an announcement within the next 48 hours...Take from that what you will, but Nash as a Leaf...Nice! We have Army and Liles set to be back by weeks end. We soooo badly need Liles back. He is a great puck moving Dman and can score! With 21 points by dec 20th (when he got hurt) He was claerly one of the leagues top D-men in scoring. Go Leafs Go!!! Oh were sooo in the playoffs!"

Especially one with a superstar price tag, without the superstar. That being said, B.Ryan has a much more attractive ticket and wouldn't bug me quite as much."
662079,misfish,2012-01-30 22:15:00,29133,Keep  Kadri.
