Not sure if it's happening this weekend.   Did Environment Canada not say it was going to be a super cold winter?  Maybe I should try exploring a far north lake for some stocked trout"
662552,Acountdeleted,2012-02-01 19:32:00,2562,Man those are some real nice panfish. I know they don't put up much of a fight but thats a real nice dinner you got there.
662553,bigugli,2012-02-01 19:33:00,6138, Environment Canada is no different than any other government agency. Never trust a word they say.
662558,Spiel,2012-02-01 19:51:00,9065,Right now I'd be happy with just any one of those fish.
662567,manitoubass2,2012-02-01 20:16:00,11391,"Oh man, look at those perch!!!  and that's a great crappie, big ol' slab!"
662585,Jet,2012-02-01 21:25:00,364,Nice stuff Ant. Go search for Eyes in the meantime! The spot is calling you!
662614,Joeytier,2012-02-01 22:40:00,3990,Nice pannies.  Southern Ontario was predicted to receive a warmer winter this year.  Doesn't mean you have to go far to find good ice.
662654,kingofthesteelhead,2012-02-02 00:51:00,140,"nice panfish,gotta love them.Just be happy you can get some tasty morsels like those close to home."
662655,young_one,2012-02-02 00:53:00,620,"Nice catch! I'm dying for Lakers and Whities   lady simcoe, please thicken up"
662732,Homer Is King,2012-02-02 02:55:00,305,Pan fish are better than no fish!!! Especially when they are Simcoe jumbos!!
662735,BillM,2012-02-02 02:59:00,17367,We'll be slamming the lakers and whities!!!!............................................in the spring.
662778,limeyangler,2012-02-02 07:12:00,5204,Nice pannies...very obese!
662798,Billy Bob,2012-02-02 12:07:00,5865,You got the best eating fish you can catch.....for get the rest when you have the best....
662813,12footspringbok,2012-02-02 13:01:00,459,You don't look like a really heavy guy....   If you want to get out for lakers and whities get out for lakers and whities....     Sorry couldn't resist...  Your last statement about going up north is what I'm doing this weekend...
662867,richyb,2012-02-02 15:07:00,774,Im in about the same situation. Putting a hurting on the perch but Im getting tired of cleaning them little buggers.
662926,frozen-fire,2012-02-02 17:51:00,542, Ohhhhh Mann. That clear ice is sooo nice.  There's just something about a few inches of clear ice separating me from 100+ fow that's holding me back! I've only been ice fishing for a couple years and it still seems sketchy to me. Especially when the ice flexes when someone walks/runs by.
