663323,Snidley,2012-02-03 20:49:00,620,Actually Bass Pro has recently changed their shipping to be much more affordable. Cabelas is more UNLESS you use the Canadian Cabelas out of Manitoba. I just got some Cabelas waders on sale for $99 CDN (same price as the US store but in USD) and with tax and shipping it was $127.62 CDN ($12.95 was shipping/handling) Unfortunately the Canadian store/website does not carry the really good products that the US store/website carries. Most of the fishing gear is real junk. Who buys that stuff anyway?
