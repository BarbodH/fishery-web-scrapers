663215,Dave Bailey,2012-02-03 14:48:00,1641,"Looks very nice, and since Lucky Strike are a Canadian company I'll definitely pick up some. I wonder if they'll be at the Spring Fishing Show?"
663216,adempsey,2012-02-03 14:54:00,1498,"If there is one company that is good at copying everyone else, it's Lucky Strike!  Regardless, they are one of my favorite fishing tackle companies.  Their products are of decent quality and very reasonably priced.   Albeit, sometimes difficult to find since they have such an enormous catalogue.   I am sure I will pick one of those swim baits up.  It's nice to see they are still making new products too.  Cheers!"
