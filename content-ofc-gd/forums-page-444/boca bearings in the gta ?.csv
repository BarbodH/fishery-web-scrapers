If you order directly from Boca Bearings, the shipping  is free, plus there is a discount code if you purchase in the next few months."
661905,Ralph Field,2012-01-30 13:56:00,1018,If you go to www.centrepinangling.com you may be able to get the bearings you need although I think that their bearings are better quality and therefore more expensive.
663145,sirfish,2012-02-03 06:40:00,175,"Jeff, order direct from Boca. Larry is an awesome guy to deal with. Shipped my new orange seal bearings for my centerpin right to my door no probs. The ones you need are :CURADO CU200E7 (KIT #)#FR-008 LD(PART #)SMR103-ZZ#5LD(2PCS) ECONO POWER-$14.95(GOOD) ,C-YZ=CERAMIC LIGHNING-$18.95(BETTER) ,C-OS=CERAMIC ORANGE SEAL ABEC7-$29.95 (BEST) Check for a Boca Bearing promo code for more savings..These will be the best bearings you'll get anywhere!.good luck."

663309,BucktownAngler,2012-02-03 20:16:00,582,are the bearings the same for the LH version of the reels?
663436,BillM,2012-02-04 03:47:00,17367," Doesn't matter which side of the reel the handle is on, lol."
