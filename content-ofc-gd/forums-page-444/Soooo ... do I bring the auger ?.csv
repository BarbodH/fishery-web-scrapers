663075,Frank,2012-02-03 01:03:00,74,"Some guys are planning on putting their huts out on Rosseau this Saturday and with the weekend looking colder than it has been this week, I would bring the auger and some water proof boots to deal with the slush. I called some bait shop up there today and asked about certain lakes, and they all said it just might be good come Saturday, slush should be freezing by then."
