662869,wallyboss,2012-02-02 15:10:00,1095,If I call somebody to come fishing with me I expect nothing from him and won't accept anything.  If somebody calls me to go fishing with him I offer but they usually don't accept it.  But if he calls to go fishing with me then we split. I leave with full tanks in truck and boat and when we come back we top up everything and split the cost.
662871,Fish Farmer,2012-02-02 15:15:00,2234,"X2. Life is to short, get over it. I just wouldn't ask him to go fishing anymore. Case closed. No sense in creating a enemy.  I was thinking the same Lew. I have a friend that has a disability that doesn't have much and it pleasure's me to take him fishing just to have him there for company. Does the heart good. I won't take anything from him. One day he surprised me and built me a rod rack out of solid Oak that holds about 30 rods with my name engraved in the wood.(Tear in my eye) Sometimes good happens to others, that do good! But most of my Buddy's know how much it costs to go fishing and help out on the gas. If the guy wasn't that flush that day don't worry, it will come out in the wash. Maybe thats just me."

662877,crappieperchhunter,2012-02-02 15:30:00,2582,If I'm driving then I'm going anyway. Why would I ask for gas money? I have made the decision to go fishing and someone else coming is not going to add to my gas expense.  The rule we follow is one guy drives the other pays for the coffee's. It all evens out.  It sounds to me like your broke so you ask people to tag along just to help pay for your addiction. Not trying to start anything here. That's just how it seems to me after reading all this.  Like others have said...I believe mothballing the rods and looking for a job would be a far better activity to spend your time on.  Even thinking of stealing a buddies gear to make things right? Houston we have a problem.
662878,Thrilla,2012-02-02 15:33:00,164,I was just going to reply along the same lines as those cph.... I never expect anything for bringing someone fishing...
662883,mike rousseau,2012-02-02 15:54:00,4661,i cant get over how many people fully finance their friends hobby...  this thread is at the point where people arent reading ALL the previous posts...  your just getting bits and pieces...  i said fishing has paid for itself this year and im still getting pooped on for fishing on a tight budget...  as far as finding a job... i lost my job the week my son was born and decided to make the best of the situation and use my parental leave/EI... im getting more on EI then most of the jobs would have paid me... so i do have income... however i went from a high paying job to EI so extra money is tighter... but bills are being payed... wedding is being paid for... theres food on my table... fiance has a good job...  im not using people to pay for my addiction...  but i dont think its right i should foot the bill for 2-3 of my friends to fish all year in my boat...
662888,fishdawg,2012-02-02 16:00:00,912," I pretty much operate the same way Lew, most of my fishing buds have their owns boats, so its often agreed we just trade local trips with each other for the most part, and costs are shared if there's distance our additional expenses involved (ex: tournaments, longer road trips, ect..)  I try to make a point of returning the trip in my boat in a timely manner when practical/possible.  If I am taking ""newbies"" or boatless buds out, the first trip is often ""on the house"" as I love introducing the sport to to others.  I once herd that you cant fill the tanks up with ""thank you's and Timmies"""

662911,Grimace,2012-02-02 17:03:00,2020,EI is to help make ends meet after a layoff while you search for another job.  EI parental leave is to help make ends meet while you spent the first year with your child after birth.  Going fishing 3 or 4 times a week is neither.  I don't mean to be rude but you are asking us for reassurance on your decision to repo a fishing rod combo to offset a perceived debt.  In doing so you have revealed information that is making people question other aspects of this ordeal.  You are starting to get a bit snarky with those that are not offering you the reassurance you are looking for.  You financed your buddy's fishing.The Governmemt of Canada financed yours.  If I was your wife I would choke you.  I have a 2 1/2 year old son and have been keeping my wife at home with the kid.  For the last little bit I have been paying for part time pre school  so he has more time spent with kids his age.  I have a big ole boat and a garage full of fishing rods but haven't gone out in some time because I want to help my wife and spend as much time as possible around them.  I couldn't imagine taking off on my wife every week-end to go fishing or sending her to work and go fishing if I was as you describe yourself as 'broke'.   I guess you could tell everyone to mind there own business but you asked.

BUT when I go out with CUSTOMERS i price the trip to MAKE A PROFIT , friends ride for free and if they want to chip in a little I dont like but will take ... YOU HAVE got to separate FRIENDS from CUSTOMERS >>> AND you brag my Guideing pays all my expensives , but YOU ALLSO say I NEED THIS money , one or the other ...

662936,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2012-02-02 18:13:00,535,"I wonder if people would be easier on Mike if the business he was starting didn't involve fishing? If he opened his own shop should his buddies be allowed free service? It's difficult because before Mike was just a guy who liked to fish but now he's trying to become a full time guide and can't just take all his friends fishing for free if he wants to be successful. I can't blame a guy for wanting to do what he loves for a living, and it's not like you can just sit around waiting for the phone to ring to be a guide. As long as his kid has a roof over her head, clothes on her back and food in her stomach I don't see a problem with it. As for what his fiancee thinks, that's between him and her. He isn't asking for relationship advice and maybe his fiancee pushed him to pursue this career choice. I know plenty of guys who started their own businesses (with varying success) and I never thought less of them for it."

662792,Spouph,2012-02-02 11:36:00,115,"  I had this same issue a few years money tight.  my suggestion is and it is going to sound rude but.  only go a third of a time, take the ones that pay and make the trip enjoyable.  Take the other 2 of the third and get a job.  If kids are involved, don't spend their education money in gas for the boat.  Two things will happen in this.  The ones that did not pay will get the message when you say no to them, you will find they will want to fish, and start paying.  I found out for my situation that my bud that were not paying because I was not letting them know that they had two.  Before you know it you will only be getting stiffed 1 fo 10.  You will never get rid of it.  The other thing is you will enjoy the fishing if your not thinking about the money.   POSITIVE ACTIONS HAVE POSITIVE REACTIONS NEGATIVE ACTIONS HAVE NEGATIVE REACTIONS it is that simple."

662807,mike rousseau,2012-02-02 12:49:00,4661,Well I'm not sure what this has to do with guiding... It has to do with being taken advantage of...   This is what im gunna do ...  I know he wants to sell the combo... He was gunna sell it for about 100  So I'm gunna forget about the gas money all summer and fall I was leaniant on... But not the 4 days of ice fishing he flat out stiffed me for...  I'm gunna sell the rod...150 Take my cut... 50 and tell him he can pick up his 100 and his other gear still at my house...  I think in the end it's a lesson for both of us and we both get the cash we want in the end...  I really think this is a best of both worlds solution...
662809,mike rousseau,2012-02-02 12:51:00,4661,  Not really  I sold him the rod... He paid... Then he owed me money... So I did a repo on it...  I think we can put this one to rest

662828,Harrison,2012-02-02 13:31:00,2202,Give him the rod back and talk to your friend.  I have a feeling your friend may need you more then just going fishing.  Ask him what's up.
662829,scugpg,2012-02-02 13:33:00,1373," Its unfortunate you need to even have that kind of conversation, it should be common courtesy to offer every time unless you are consistently switching between his/your boat or some other arrangement.  Doesn't mean you have to accept every time, but the offer is nice it acknowledges the time and $ you put into your rig....not to mention in your case fishing ability you seem to put lots in the boat."
662834,Uncle Buck,2012-02-02 13:38:00,1000,I'd give it back to him and never fish with him again...  you should have cut him after the 2nd trip with no $$  you gotta pay to play...  a good buddy wouldn't do that to you anyways...

If one of my buddies called me up to go out on the boat for the day, I would NOT expect to be asked for gas money, straight up. I'd offer to pay for something but to call a friend up then ask for funds is not on in my books. If they called you up, for sure you can ask but not if you're doing the cold calling."
662838,mike rousseau,2012-02-02 13:48:00,4661, That's fair...  But as far as my wallet is concerned... Fishing paid for itself this year...  Guiding covered my expenses...  So IMO... I think it was ok that I went fishing...

The guy doesn't have the cash to pony up but is out talking about flowers that he bought for his girlfriend and going out and getting gassed up. Do you really need a guy like this around?? Seriously?? I know you are trying to get a guiding service going but it's a tough gig to make any real money. I'm not going to preach to you about how you should live your life or make your living but BE REALISTIC AND BE TRUE TO YOURSELF. I wish you the best of luck in whatever you  want to do.
662856,mike rousseau,2012-02-02 14:27:00,4661, Thanks for the well wishes...  Like I said... This situation has nothing to do with guiding...  As far as that goes... I'm not looking to make a living off of guiding... I'm looking to help cover my fishing costs and meet some cool people... And so far everyone that has been in my boat has stayed in touch in one way or another... And I covered my fishing cost last year...  So I'm really happy so far...

The boat and truck I own but the course is private property so they need to get paid regardless.  I look at this way as well. If I asked some buds to come up to my cottage because I wanted some company for the weekend, I wouldn't be pissed if they showed up with nothing but the clothes on their backs and a toothbrush. Not going to turn down some nice aged steaks from Cumbrae either but the point for me is, *I* asked them to come up so I don't see why they should be *expected* to pay for stuff is all I'm getting at.  and fwiw, re: Mike's *friend*....I woulda cut him off second time around.

After sleeping on it, i would be the better man, and give him his combo back. Seeing he is a local, he may have some nasty friends who could start a war, and make things tough on you. Look what he is gonna miss out on in the future.The adventure of fishing with you. Let him know that his fishing days with you are over. He has no boat, and by the looks of it, no one else to take him fishing. Once he sobers up, he may realize just what he has lost, and call you up to pay up. Follow your heart bud"
662740,rob v,2012-02-02 03:16:00,535,to me it depends on what the original understanding was.   was it your idea to take it easy on him for costs or was it his.  was the arrangement not to share costs a temporary measure ?  if he left the rod with you in exchange for costs or he made a commitment to pay his share but didn't than i think you're in the right. If not than i don't think you should be keeping his stuff.    most importantly do you want to fish with this guy again?  doesn't sound like it.
662742,danbouck,2012-02-02 03:25:00,4380,Personally I would rather spend the day on the water or ice and not worry about splitting money. My buddies and I never keep track. If they want to pay for gas or bait I let them (usually). If I am broke someone always steps up to get out fishing. If they are broke I step up.
662744,mike rousseau,2012-02-02 03:35:00,4661, But with me... I'm broke... I don't have a job... I need the gas money so I can afford my next day of fishing...  Also  9/10 times on the water  it's with my truck and my boat...the other days are in my brothers boat... And we don't count gas cause I take him and he takes me...  Also...  I put in about 100 days of fishing last year... At 20-40$ a day that's 2000-4000 in gas at the end of the year...  So people stiffing me really adds up  If I get stiffed 1/3 times out...It's a grand at the end of the year  That's a grand off my debt...  Or a grand in my kids education fund...
662745,manitoubass2,2012-02-02 03:38:00,11391,"A good friend will cover the cost one way or another. It could be many things, or just money, either or.  This has obviously happened to all of us at one point in time.  To me, it doesn't really matter. If I go out of my way, whether it be mileage or something, I expect to be repaid, whether it be money, bait, coffee, or maybe you just fillet after were done?  Doesn't really matter, it's just common courtesy.  The only person I've ever screwed on a trip was my dad. And I was down and out, and the trip was his idea. Within a few days I repaid the money with interest. If I couldn't, it was a no, or I made sure he understood the situation.  IMO, don't lose a good friend over petty things. Just don't take him on his word for a fishing trip.  But only you know if he's a good guy or a loser. Do whatever you feel necessary.  I'm guessing, by posting this question, you feel bad and need to justify your actions. If thats the case, return the rod, apologize, and thoroughly explain why you made that decision.  Then move on"

One day down the road when your hurting, he may be able to help you out some way. If you keep his rod, he is going to be pissed, and your ""friend"" won't help ya at all.  I never take gas money from friends, but I always offer if they drive. They hardly take it, but I can't just not offer. If Im not driving, i ALWAYS buy coffees, food and bait. Always.

That money would be going into an RESP as your son's future is more important than you landing skis or eyes.  Not saying you hang up the rods obviously, but maybe cut back on it some or go out in a buddy's boat every now and then.  Like Bill said...priorities.

I just wouldn't dial his number next time I was goin out on the water.  Bill, I hear that. I was on a seriously tight budget this past summer and parked the boat the entire season. It never saw the water. Tough go for sure but it had to be done to throw money at some other things that took precedence"
662761,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-02-02 04:34:00,0,"fishing can be VERY expensive so it would be best just not to bring someone that can't pitch in if you need it.  i wouldn't take his rod however.  not really a classy move, especially if you're trying to make a name for yourself as a guide.  take the high road.  you can't force a person to make fishing a priority in their lives.  i've learned this lesson many times over."
662771,Tybo,2012-02-02 05:43:00,1373,First off I never ask for money when I go fishing.I'm going with or with out you. When a friend asks to take them fishing.I expect at least half or all depending on how close of a friend he is.
662772,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2012-02-02 06:13:00,535,"It's not really a black and white situation, difficult to say. I've never demanded gas money (or accepted) but I'm also usually offering to take someone fishing when I'm going out anyway so they're not costing me anything. There's been times where myself and others take turns buying bait but I'm usually fishing with family (who I don't ask for money from) or friends who's boat I've also used. I don't keep track of those things because friends should be willing to return the favour when push comes to shove.  But what it boils down to is he really a good friend, or just taking advantage of you? Sounds like the latter to be honest. Everyone has a breaking point when they run out of patience and it sounds like you've had enough. Nobody likes being someone else's doormat. You're in a situation where you're starting a guide service, you want this to be a source of income. You're not just doing it as a hobby and he should understand that.  I wouldn't keep his rod though. Like someone else mentioned it won't help your reputation at all (and that's huge for a guide since most of it's word of mouth). Just tell the guy straight up if you want to come fishing again then pay me first. Some people if you give them an inch they will take a mile and see how far they can get before you say something. Set firm boundaries for everyone from now on and take this as a learning experience. Money comes and goes, don't do something you might regret later for a few bucks, even if you do feel you're right.    "
662775,limeyangler,2012-02-02 06:57:00,5204,"Mike...i have had 'friends' like this guy too. I have been promised money before only not to see it materialise....i no longer fish with these people and have lost 2 friends.  I understand the point some people have made about not asking or even expecting money if you are already going...but when i hear about how good life on pogie is all winter i think...yeah...its friggin great as long as you have someone like me to ferry yur arse on and off lakes with my snowmachine, my gas, my truck, my bait, my portable shelter, my fishfinder....sometimes even my friggin sandwiches and smokes! MOOCHERS NOT WELCOME!  Give the moochin' dood back his rod and be done with him, but ignore his calls for a month before you give it back"
662776,manitoubass2,2012-02-02 07:03:00,11391," All of our plans are now cancelled. I was totally relying on your gas....  lol, good points though.  P.S. When you come to Rainy next year, will you please pay my rent??? BWAHAHAHA. Small price to pay for landing those hyyyyyuge rainy river small eyes"
662777,limeyangler,2012-02-02 07:07:00,5204,  Darn it...what you never recieved the check i sent? lololol
662781,Big Cliff,2012-02-02 09:45:00,6899,"I never ask for or expect gas money when a friend and I go fishing or hunting (or much of anything else) unless it is a special trip and we have agreed to split costs up front. When a friend drops by the house for a visit I don't usually ask them to cover part of my heat or hydro or pay for their coffee or beer either. I will usually offer to pony up some cash if I am going with someone else but that usually depends on who it is, if it is someone that I take out with me then I usually figure it all works out in the end. (guess that's why I'm always broke)  As far as loosing $20.00 a day in gas money and how it is going to affect your child and family; Tim Horton's pays $10.25/hr to start, that is $82.00 a day X 100 days = $8200.00 toward your kids education or your debts. If the money is that important to you, get a job and fish when you can like the majority of us do."
662782,Skipper D,2012-02-02 09:57:00,1970,"I feel for you Mike , your young and your in buisness and now learning what it takes . Give it a few more years and buisness will teach you all the right answers for every situation that will come your way and get prepaired for the changes that will happen to you , for now learn how to seperate friends from customers , you have to do this if you want to remain sucsesful in the future . The last thing you want to do is give him back his stuff cause then you feel like he got the best of you i know but heres what the bigger men will do . Thats just about every thing the others sudgessted to you on here no matter how bad it makes you feel , but unlike some here you are a buisness man and if you would like to know what i would do as i am a buisness man , i would aproch him face to face ,hand him his gear ,and warn him that if he ever wants to go fish with you again and where the cost needs to be split because you can't afford freebies to all your friends just yet , your gona take him out in the shipping lanes and thro him and he's gear over board if he thinks you need to foot the bill each time yous go out . This now should make you feel better and at the same time teach him where your coming from , now you can go your way and he can figure out if he still likes you or not , either way its no skin off your butt and proof is most here already told you how they feel about a person like that . Good luck Mike"
662783,lew,2012-02-02 10:07:00,12766,"I'm sitting here at 5:00 AM reading this post and the question that keeps coming to mind is why are these people going fishing all the time when they have no jobs and no money  Hang up the fishing poles boys and go find a job and start earning money to support your selves.  If I didn't have a job or the money to live properly, the last thing I'd be thinking about would be fishing.  As for taking money for gas, over the last 10 years I've had about 65 DIFFERENT guys & gals from this board in my boat for a day of fishing and I would NEVER accept money from any of them.  Different story if we go away for a few days and there's hotel & restaurant bills to pay, but just for a day, the gas is on me. But it's the same when I fish outta their boat, I don't offer them money for gas either.  As for the guys fishing pole, give it back to him, but that's just me."
662673,mike rousseau,2012-02-02 01:33:00,4661,Well...  Had a buddy going through tough times this year... So I kinda took it easier on him with gas money for fishing... Then this fall... I was pretty much getting nothing... Then 4 trips on ice with literally nothing...  This is a buddy I took out at least once a week... Got his pb walleye and musky this year...  I know he was in a tight place with money cause he wasn't working... But he lives at home with his parents...  I'm not working...I have a house... And a baby... And truck payments...   So he ended up leaving a musky combo at my house this fall...  And after avoiding my calls for a month trying to get my money... He calls looking to come get the musky combo...  I said no dice...  I'm selling it to pay for all the gas from this year...  And he gets mad like I'm the bad guy...  And worst of all I kept reading posts on Facebook about him buying his girlfriend flowers and getting drunk... It's annoying when someone can't/won't pay gas money but buys beer and flowers...  Anyways... I think what I did was called for...  Do you?  By the way... From now on its gunna be cash up front for gas money... And the guest is paying for more then half from now on...
662679,e-z-out,2012-02-02 01:38:00,1052,Your in the right Mike But more then half on the Gas is a bit to much.
662682,woodenboater,2012-02-02 01:44:00,2277,"I think it depends on whether he said he would make good or not. Regardless, I'd be inclined to give him back his gear and be done with him. You don't need friends like this in your life Mike. Moochers aren't worth the effort so move on and don't look back.  I also think you have to be more discriminating on who gets a ride on the water, this *should* prevent this from happening again."
662683,bigugli,2012-02-02 01:45:00,6138,"You got stiffed, now you get some payback.  There is always a risk that when you do a good turn, someone will take advantage of your good intentions. I'm certain it has happened to many here"
662684,Rod Caster,2012-02-02 01:46:00,5784,"No pity for those who piss away money then try to eke out freebies from friends. I probably wouldn't have sold his gear; that's a bold move on your part and kind of makes me laugh. Good on you for having a spine. Be prepared to lose a friend though..some people, especially the selfish ones can't handle back-lash.  I had a buddy sit on my new ice rod last year and break it. This guy makes tonnes of cash and spends on the stupidest things, and I was down $30 due to his drunkedness. He completely ignored my request for pay back until one day in public I said ""you shouldn't be sitting on other guy's rods"". He paid me that night."
662686,Rizzo,2012-02-02 01:47:00,4754,"If you were looking to get paid and he wasn't ponying up I would have cut my losses and stop taking him before it got too out of hand. After two trips of nothing I would have cut the guy loose...when he calls to find out why just be honest...fishing is expensive and you have a few people who help you cover the costs. If he wants to fish again he'll do the same! As far as ""more than half"" this is actually reasonable in my opinion but not easy to enforce. After all, you pay the insurance, tune-ups, new tires etc etc for the boat/trailer...its just hard to ask for more than half. Usually I go half half with people, but then let them buy me a coffee and bagel when we stop. The odd coffee/bagel is nowhere near my cost for operating the boat and keeping it on the road, but its better than nothing"
662687,irishfield,2012-02-02 01:48:00,26272,I thought this was gonna be a post about getting spooled by a big 'eye!!
662690,workwear,2012-02-02 01:56:00,592,id give his musky combo back...shake his hand...and be the better man!!!  afterall its only money!!!
662691,Rizzo,2012-02-02 01:56:00,4754,how much do you want for the combo
662692,e-z-out,2012-02-02 01:57:00,1052,  Really Peter really lol
662693,Tom McCutcheon,2012-02-02 01:59:00,627," Only when he comes to the ""BITTER END"""
662697,scugpg,2012-02-02 02:04:00,1373,"I'd give the guy his gear back and be done with it. Some folks don't realize the costs of boat ownership its not much to request to spilt fuel and buy coffee etc. Its too bad that you have to request it in the first place it should be offered every time....even if you decline to take money.  ""well you are going anyways"" does not cut it. But clearly some don't see this as a financial priority."
662699,bassman87,2012-02-02 02:05:00,586,"i see no wrong in your part. gotta hate freeloaders, you shouldnt even have to ask for money. if i went out with you and you drove id pay for most of the gas if not all."
662700,Nipfisher,2012-02-02 02:05:00,2449,"I would give him back the combo (he comes picks it up) and be done with him. It is really not worth it. He will feel like a dufus, and you need a new fishing buddy. If I lived closer I'd pay my share to fish with you."
662704,Sawyer,2012-02-02 02:13:00,48,"Hi Mike,  It's always a little tricky when friends but especially good friends are involved when it comes to money.  I think most of us on the board have a friend or know of someone who does that matches your buddy.  Whether your actions was called for or not depends on the lens in which you see the situation so I will not comment on that.  What I will say to you is good friends are hard to come by.  You will have to decide if this situation is worth tainting the friendship.  It seems like you fish with this buddy often so the company he keeps isnt so bad I suspect.  However, given that he hasnt returned your phone calls in over a month and then only calls you when he wants his equipment back - one has to question how he sees your friendship.  Personally, I think you should give him his equipment back and be firm again with how you cant continue to support him financially on fishing trips.  Selling his equipment and the cash you receive from it will never make you forget what happened.  If your friend responds immaturely and without a sense of understanding of your point - then I dont think he's worth your time of day.  -Sawyer"
662705,mike rousseau,2012-02-02 02:13:00,4661,The deal breaker was that he went ice fishing 4 days straight... I paid gas and bait all 4 days... He said he'd have my money the last night of the four days... Then he dodged me for a month...  The biggest reason I'm keeping the combo is because he wants to sell it to buy a vexilar... Not pay me back!!!
662706,Spouph,2012-02-02 02:14:00,115,"tight spot, if all you said was true you are in the right, hope your good deeds help you with good karma.  Just a suggestion, you have helped this guy out with the gas and friendship, and the fishing.  Give him his tackle back, it is only money.  Everything in life happens for a reason, you seem like a good guy, be true to yourself.  If your asking this question it is to relieve some guilt.  I would not blame you if you did keep his stuff.  You got stiffed. But If you were really worried about the money, you would not have taken him the 4 times, you would have stopped after the first.  Mabey he did not know how you felt till you held on to his equipment or mabey he figured you were going anyway.  We all make mistakes, somthing good will come from giving his combo back, trust me.  Good friends are rare, this guy seems like a good friend that goofed up.  For the original question (was I out of line) the answer is no.  I am just trying help you reason with the crappy situation.  I hope you find work, if you are looking, If it just about the money talk to the guy he might surprise you.  I have some rods that have a ton of setamental and superstisious value to them, it just seem wrong to me.  good luck and try no to let this fester I have seen good thing go so bad over a couple hundred dollars.  seems silly after the fact.  Just so you know I am in dept and put my workboats on one foot at a time every day because I have to.  Just so you know where this is coming from."
662707,Handlebarz,2012-02-02 02:17:00,3790,Mike like others have said I would give this scum his rod back and be done with him also. I have had to do that in the past.  As for charging more then half the gas there is nothing wrong with that at all I would think it depends on who is going out with you but who sais it has to be half or more are they making you go to the pump NO so let them know what you would like ahead of time that way its out there or let them know what you use for gas in a day if its $30 then say $45 if ya want a bit more that way they understand ahead of time. Most guys who own boats know there is alot more to a boat then just gas.  The ones who piss me off are the ones who never offer but always want to come out fishing. I dont usually charge for gas but 85-90% offer it. If its a buddy that you will fish with at different times in there boat I dont take the cash. Others come down here in there little car and save to towing gas and big gas price from there trucks and toss me $20 or so I always feel bad for taking it but do it to show respect for there friendship and there understanding that it costs a bunch to run the boat.  Heck with oil at $50 a gallon it sure is not cheap.  Either way ya dont need people like that in your life from what I can see from all your posts your better then he is take the high road IT SUCKS BUT YOU WILL FEEL BETTER WHEN YOU GO TO SLEEP AT NIGHT
662710,Ice Fishing Ham,2012-02-02 02:21:00,83,"Hold it it here! Did he leave his walleye and musky gear for you to sale in trade for gas? No assumptions here, yes or no! Either way give him his equipment back and take your loses and move on much wiser. Never have any dealings with him again, never again!  Remember there are friends and acquaintances."
662712,Muskieman,2012-02-02 02:23:00,2472,"In the past I've done the same with a Weatherby 300 Mag rifle ...my Bud who owed me 2k ( boat loan) realized he had burned a bridge .... He apologized and we are good friends again , he pays up front now if we do something together.... Hard lesson learned for both of you .... Kudos  So how much for the combo? Is left hand retrieve?  Randy "
662713,kickingfrog,2012-02-02 02:24:00,8333,Give him back his stuff and walk away.
662714,Terry,2012-02-02 02:25:00,14456,"maybe I am not getting it or I read it wrong but you said here you took it easy on him well if that means he said ""what do you want for gas"" and you said 5 bucks or maybe nothing or maybe you said don't worry about it..then you stole his combo..give it back   but if you said ""you know we agreed to split the cost and I know you are hurting so I will let you ride for a short time ,then you have to pony up what you owe me""... then the combo is yours  but if you did not make yourself clear, then who is the bad guy  again I don't know, I am posing a questions not stating facts here"

662716,Rizzo,2012-02-02 02:25:00,4754," that's some key information that was initially missing. At first I thought your move was quite drastic, now I understand it better. Either way, still probably not worth it. I say drop off the rod at his house, and see if he man's up and tracks you down to repay you. If he doesn't he's not worth your friendship imo"
