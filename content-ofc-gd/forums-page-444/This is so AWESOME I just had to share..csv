663294,Fang,2012-02-03 19:03:00,1330,"Same here, played many games there for Mississauga and Cawthra Park and then coached Cooksville minor hockey teams for 5 years. Even played a few years there in a mens league. No other arena in GTA that has as much kharma for me.  I got a chill when I saw ""the walk"" from the dressing room up the ramps to the bench area. Probably the worst skate sharpening in the whole country though!!"

663533,Tootsie II,2012-02-04 19:35:00,162,There was a story  on CBC or CTV news channel this morning that reported that these players were not told in advance that Budweiser was setting this whole thing up. They let it build gradually during the first and second periods. That's why the players look so shocked.
