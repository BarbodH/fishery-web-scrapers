662685,Jon,2012-02-02 01:46:00,209,"I use the Ibycus maps on my Garmin unit and really like them. You can't route on them but for a free map, they likely have most everything you need. Pretty acurate (all things considered) but they don't contain the extra information that the Backroads Mapbooks does. Give the Ibycus maps a try - you have nothing to lose.  Jon"

662787,wormdunker,2012-02-02 10:50:00,1711,"Get an iphone.  They have an app called ""maps"".  It is a GPS, u can also find local stores, services if U R travelling in a town U R not familiar with.  Then U buy an app called ""Navionics"" for $15.00.  It is very similar to the chip U buy for your chartplotter which is $300.00  Oh yah make sure U get the free app ""Angry Birds"""
