662814,Billy Bob,2012-02-02 13:02:00,5865,"Yep, it's ground hog day again....but this time I got up nice and early and took out my trusty .22-250 Ruger named ""Chuckmate"" and I shot that rodent before he had a chance to see his shadow....and I just checked the long range forecast and I think it worked...."
662817,Rod Caster,2012-02-02 13:14:00,5784,So early that it started last fall. Brutal excuse for a winter this year. Them pine beetles are gonna have a great year.
662849,Billy Bob,2012-02-02 14:05:00,5865,OH NO....I think I shot the wrong rodent.....  http://www.buffalonews.com/topics/winter_2011-12/article720005.ece
662954,Locnar,2012-02-02 19:03:00,645,"Hm, you're right. You did shoot the wrong rodent. That one looks a little suspicious, should be assassinated..."
662972,highdrifter,2012-02-02 20:14:00,2534, I got a feeling the ticks are gonna have a great year too..
663040,Billy Bob,2012-02-02 23:36:00,5865,Not to mention black flies and the Canadian Air Force (mosquitoes)
663042,SirCranksalot,2012-02-02 23:39:00,3291,The local groundhog is never wrong---an early spring and six more weeks of winter are the same thing!!
663049,Billy Bob,2012-02-02 23:58:00,5865, You are NEVER suppose to mention that....It's like telling kids there is no Santa Claus....
