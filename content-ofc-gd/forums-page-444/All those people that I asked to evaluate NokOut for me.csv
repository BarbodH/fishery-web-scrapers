Home Hardware is now considering putting it into their distribution system for me and it would be a big help if any of you that have written any articles about the product could forward copies of those articles to me. In fact we currently have about 14 of their stores carrying the product right now. Hopfully we'll be able to say ""available at a Home Hardware near you"" in the near future.  Please send them to my email address [emailÂ protected] ASAP.  Thanks so much for all your help!  Cliff"

I do have an email from Brice Folden of Wild TV saying that they have evaluated it and are quite happy to endorce the product but more is better!  Can't tell you all how much I appreciate your help!
