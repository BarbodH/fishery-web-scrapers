663158,Billy Bob,2012-02-03 11:27:00,5865,My dad loved his rabbit/pheasant/duck hunting......my mom bought him a 16 gauge Remington 11-48 for a anniversary present that he just loved...with that gun (which is now retired in my gun safe) he could jump and kill a bunny with a shot from the hip most times....not to mention the countless ducks and pheasants he brought home....but he never went deer hunting for some reason.
663237,SirCranksalot,2012-02-03 15:39:00,3291,"tb,  just make sure Elmer Fudd doesn't find out where you live!   I grew up eating rabbits fairly often--wild ones my father brought home.---but now I eat more rabbit food."
663266,Leecher,2012-02-03 18:00:00,7832,Nice setup Ron   (hope I got your name right   ) I can't say I would eat one of those if I hand fed them      wife and daughter definitely wouldn't  I bet they are a lot of work keeping the cages cleaned. Thanks for sharing Leechman
663277,tb4me,2012-02-03 18:33:00,3295,"Thanks,Leechman!! Yes you got my name right! Just don't call me late for beer..lol The cleaning isn't as bad as one might think.I have trays under each cage and Rubbermaid bins under the outdoor hutches. All I have to do it pick them up and dump them in the garden or the massive composter I built. I don't breed in the summer months. I like to fish way to much. We have the trailer on the Trent River and are there 2 weekends a month thru the summer, so I usually start to cull off any time now! Come on spring!! anyway thanks to all for the comments! If anyone in my area wants to try a rabbit let me know! Ill beat the prices in the grocery store anytime..."
663328,spinnerdoc,2012-02-03 21:03:00,556,"When I just arrived to Canada, my brother in law fed me rabbit, didn't tell what it was, he just told it's good. I loved it ever since.  It was marinated with red wine, garlic, salt and pepper overnight, then cooked alltogether with rice, bay leaf and peas mmmm...."
663330,GBW,2012-02-03 21:05:00,8460,"Can I get a ""lucky rabbit foot"" or two sent my way for my kids?  LOL!"
663336,tb4me,2012-02-03 21:27:00,3295,Sure thing..Not sure if your serious or not but I was actually wondering if rabbit tails or hydes would interest any fly or lure makers here on the board? I dont tan the hydes but if anyone wants them just let me know...
663345,GBW,2012-02-03 22:02:00,8460,"Yeah, now that the joke is done I am interested in both.  foot for a keychain and a tail or two.  PM me how to pay you for shipping and so on."
663347,GBW,2012-02-03 22:04:00,8460,rabbit fur should work as well as buck tail but shorter and softer.
663353,Carp,2012-02-03 22:32:00,1488,"Eating rabbit for as long as I can remember, although I only have it a couple of times a year now when my mom makes it and saves me some. My grandparents raised them for years and it was always a treat when we went over on a Sunday for braised rabbit in white wine sauce. Mmmmmm !!!!"
663359,Roy,2012-02-03 23:03:00,13728, Rabbit fur is one of the best materials to use for jigs and fly tying...especially rabbit strip flies and egg sucking leeches. It's good stuff. It has a unique pulsating action. Wish I lived closer to you.
663362,Twocoda,2012-02-03 23:09:00,4130,to tan small hides is very easy Ron....turpintine and methylhydrade (wood alcohol) sometimes known as fuel line antifreeze....masks are great for tieing flies....i cant wait till i actually have time in my life to tie flies again...  Cool hobbie....funny comment on the name between the bread....lmao!
662913,tb4me,2012-02-02 17:07:00,3295,"Just wanted to share with you all our families other hobby! We raise Rabbits for meat. We make sausages , Hamburg's and meatballs with the meat we hand raise. here is a video I posted on YouTube.. Enjoy! <iframe width=""420"" height=""315"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/wIx6qD7rvJg"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>"
662915,mercman,2012-02-02 17:21:00,7054,OMG !!! They are so cute!!!
662917,ketchenany,2012-02-02 17:27:00,3229,MMMMMMMMMMMM Rabbit with roasted potatoes/white wine . . .
662918,capt bruce,2012-02-02 17:28:00,820,"And they TASTE GOOD TOO , best of both worlds , why eat only the ugly .."
662920,manitoubass2,2012-02-02 17:31:00,11391,"That's pretty neat!  How do the sausages etc taste? I've only had rabbit in a stew, and that was great! Gotta imagine a burger would be mighty tasty"
662924,bigugli,2012-02-02 17:41:00,6138,"Nice looking Rex's.  Have you ever tried raising the larger breeds of meat rabbit? Flemish and  Checkered giants are huge animals by comparison. Even a French lop averages twice the size of a standard Rex or California. I got my kids interested in raising show rabbits for a few years, but they could not see them as livestock. I ran the fur and feather show at the county fair for a few years. There was a big demand for meat rabbits back then."
662930,tb4me,2012-02-02 18:00:00,3295,"Thanks bigugli, those are Cali crossed with Flemish giants. my adult doe weighs in at a whopping 12 pounds! I tried New Zealand's but they were to small and weak. We had something spook them in the hutch last spring and 3 of the young broke their necks scrambling to get away..I imagine they hit the wall in the hutch running..So we are now raising the Californian crossed with the Flemish giants. We love the size of the Flemish and the meat quality of the Cali's.  manitoubass2 the sausages are amazing! go 70% rabbit and 30% pork throw in a clove of garlic per pound of meat, a tablespoon of fennel per pound of meat a teaspoon of salt n pepper per pound grind it all up, then put into pure pork casings and you have the best sausages ever! For burgers or meatballs use the same 70-30 mix but use regular ground beef. You cant use lean as there is no fat content in the Rabbit meat at all. Mix the rabbit and beef after grinding, use what ever spices you like when you make burgers. Thanks again to all for the positive comments!"
662937,Frank,2012-02-02 18:14:00,74,"Great video of urban farming! My family use to breed rabbits to sell, mind you my dad and grandfather would of rather harvested them, it's a great idea that you don't name the ones you will harvest, it does make things easier, I could only imagine if they named all the cattle on a friends farm haha"
662939,mercman,2012-02-02 18:25:00,7054, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDe8fTgVUZw  
662943,manitoubass2,2012-02-02 18:28:00,11391," I'm gonna try that recipe this week I think. My moms coming for a visit so it would be nice to have something different. We have some great farms around our area, so I'll make a few calls I suppose.  Are you BBQ'ing the sausages, or frying them up???  Just gotta remember not to tell the kiddos what they're eating until they're done, lol   "
662944,tb4me,2012-02-02 18:34:00,3295,lol funny..I see your quite a ways away from me or id offer up 1 or 2. treat the sausages just as you would pork. cook them as you see fit. my favourite way to cook them is to defrost them and bbq them slow n low.. another way (my wife's favourite) is to grab a pack from the freezer toss em in a fry pan with some hot water and simmer with a lid over them. When the sausages are defrosted and cooked she slices them on a 45 degree angle and makes home made sausage spaghetti .. its amazing  
662947,manitoubass2,2012-02-02 18:41:00,11391," Oh man, my mouth is already watering. Thanks for the tips!  What should one expect to pay? I'd assume it's by the pound? I'm going to call a few places here shortly, hopefully it's not really expensive.  "
662948,bigugli,2012-02-02 18:41:00,6138,"New Zealands are too small for meat produstion, even though they are classed as a meat rabbit. I have seen grand champion grade Giants weighing in at 30lbs at various shows. Have you tried roast rabbit?  Young rabbit, slow roasted, is almost like chicken."
662950,manitoubass2,2012-02-02 18:49:00,11391,"$6 per pound, and the first lb is free for a new customer!!!  I'm sold. I'm gonna do these up for the SuperBowl this weekend"
662951,tb4me,2012-02-02 18:50:00,3295,"wow 30 pound rabbits...lol i would imagine they take quite a while to get that size. The nice thing with the rabbits I breed is I kull at 3 months old, they weigh anywhere between 5 to 7 pounds. When deboned on averagie we get aporx 3 pounds of edible rabbit meat, these rabbits develop fast. I myself love roast young rabbit. The wife and daughter wont eat it thou.lol"
662952,tb4me,2012-02-02 18:52:00,3295,"is that live weight? Keep in mind rabbits cant be sold ""processed"" unless its goverment stamped.. Seems like a good price! The ones in the grocery store the other day were 37 bux and up!!!!"
662958,manitoubass2,2012-02-02 19:14:00,11391," I'm not sure? I didn't ask. I'll find out shortly though, I'm going to pick some up when my daughter wakes up!   "
662963,Joey,2012-02-02 19:36:00,9122,"Cool video, I learned a thing or two  And yes they are cute, so no way I could even do it.  I'll eat them, but couldn't go through the whole process of raising and killing."
662966,Skipper D,2012-02-02 19:43:00,1970,"LOL........ i like the choclate ones the best ....lol , sorry just had to say it , very interesting ttho , i'd give it a try ."
663021,tb4me,2012-02-02 22:47:00,3295,I too like the choclate ones! Ears first...lol
