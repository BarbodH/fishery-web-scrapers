663004,Cudz,2012-02-02 22:24:00,2652,"Just met with someone regarding the attempt to make a fishing specialty area in the 2 Barrie stores and in Midland also.  THey had buch of high end stuff that will be going in like Shimano crucial and compre and clarus rods. G-Loomis rods  . Fenwick HMX rods. Corado and citica baitcasters, stratic and stratic cI4 spinning reels. Lots of higher end daiwa reels as well. Garcia Revo baitcasters and good spinning reels. Abu Veritas rods. A whole section of musky lures including a full line of Bucher lures and Bulldawg and a bunch of inline spinners. Cannon and scotty downriggers. Minn Kota motors with 80lb+ thrust. G-Loomis sweatshirsts, hoodies and hats. Reef runner lures zoom soft plastics and a bunch more stuff.  Should be interesting.  Not sure if there is a market for it.  I also told him about xzone slammers and swammers and when we looked it up the kingston store and one other store already stocks them so he thought it would not be a problem.  He was missing some essentials like good drop shot weights and circle hooks but most of the stuff was quality.  There was a whole bunch of dodger and fly combos too.  Interesting. There was a bunch of other stuff but I can't remember.  Oh yeah, frog toggs rainwear.  This was the rep and apparently this is going to happen.  We'll see."
663007,bucktail,2012-02-02 22:27:00,1857,Cudz nice seing you again! I guess it would be an attempt to reaquire some business that BPS has grabbed.
663009,NAW,2012-02-02 22:27:00,4022,That'll be nice..  Wonder if they'll have the higher end stuff on for %70 off like their mastercraft stuff
663018,Skipper D,2012-02-02 22:39:00,1970,"Hi ther Chris , nice to see you pop up , looks like some one might have to make me a shopping list ...lol . It would be nice not to have to make the drive all the time BPS"
663025,Rustic-Fisher,2012-02-02 22:54:00,826,"Wow, that's great news, with the 10x Canadian tire bucks gas coupons and a thirsty Dodge Ram MegaCab I'll be able to buy highend gear a lot more lol"
663029,Skipper D,2012-02-02 23:06:00,1970, sorry .....lol...... you do have one
663032,misfish,2012-02-02 23:18:00,29133,"Yeah,I talk to the guy at the south end store. Theres some big changes coming there. They want to be the fishing guru here,as the north end store really covers the hunting aspect.  Oh yeah,Hi ya Chris,nice to hear from you. Hope alls well."
663045,adempsey,2012-02-02 23:53:00,1498,"Nice to have more options.  I noticed they started adding ""higher end"" items last year or the year before (e.g., Gary Yamamoto plastics).   They are redoing the fishing sections in the two stores near me as well.  However, I don't see much success unless they lower their prices.  They are WAY TOO HIGH.   The only time I ever buy anything fishing-related from CTC is if it's on clearance or I am desperate.  Although, if they follow their sale strategy like they do for their other products, I could see myself purchasing fishing gear from them.  I have to admit though, the CTC fishing sections is FAR superior to that in any Canadian Walmart I've been too."
663051,misfish,2012-02-03 00:01:00,29133," I totally agree with you  FishLogic.  One thing I will say about  walmart, hunting and fishing stuff,is when the season ends,weather hunting or fishing,it goes cheap. I bought 5 orange hunters vests for 2 bucks a piece,also 5 pairs of light hunting gloves for 3 bucks. From the asking price to the reduce price,I saved over 50+ bucks. Say what you want about them,I win. BOTTOM LINE."
663054,kickingfrog,2012-02-03 00:06:00,8333,"Nice to have more options. For those of us who don't live less than a 20 minute drive from a tackle store, CTC is a nice option. Price is always a factor, but I'd have to buy a lot of ""over priced"" tackle to make up for the $1.23 a litre for the gas to drive to a major store."
663162,12footspringbok,2012-02-03 11:34:00,459,This would be nice!  I used to like going to Simcoe Bait and Tackle. Lou might have been a bit crusty on the edges but he always had what you needed.
