661985,krawler,2012-01-30 17:52:00,167,"I actually have a day off tomorrow, never get a weekday.  Would like to venture on simcoe for lakers and whities either bp or out of oro.  With conditions the way they are I would rather partner up with someone to be safe instead of going alone.  Anyone interested in meeting up around 7am to about noon or so?  Pm me if interested.  Thanks"
662020,irishfield,2012-01-30 19:43:00,26272,SW wind @ 30kph and 7 degrees.. you might wanna rethink that Kris !
662026,misfish,2012-01-30 20:11:00,29133,And calling for rain aswell.
662031,BillM,2012-01-30 20:38:00,17367,"Yeah, I wouldn't be out on that lake tomorrow.  Unless you bring your swimsuit and fins!"
662178,Chuck Best,2012-01-31 10:13:00,308,"Well,with no steady work to be had,I'll be starting my ice fishing season in about 2 1/2 hrs with RR at BP.Hopefully I'll be able to post a report later today.....TC and tight lines....Chuck..."
662187,Fisherman,2012-01-31 12:14:00,7201,"Careful at Billy Goat Hill, good luck."
662195,Rizzo,2012-01-31 12:55:00,4754, good thing it doesn't get icy there
662205,BillM,2012-01-31 13:34:00,17367,"Bring ice skates, should make the walk down even more fun!"
662219,Skipper D,2012-01-31 15:13:00,1970,"Your probably out there by now , just wanted to say I'd be there with you with bells on Krawler if we were going in a boat , sorry bud ."
662361,Rizzo,2012-02-01 00:40:00,4754,"I took a drive by today, quite a few cars for a weekday I thought, don't any of you guys have jobs!"
662403,Sinker,2012-02-01 03:39:00,8692," If I planned my trips based on the weather forcast, I'd never go fishing!! Just go....and deal with what is dealt to ya. Today was a beautiful day to be on the ice!! So far this season, I haven't fished thru the ice on a day it was below zero....I'm not complaining!!  How'd you guys make out??  S."
662414,irishfield,2012-02-01 04:50:00,26272, Nor do I Shayne as you can see from my fall muskie trips! Concern was 3 to 4 inches of ice and a wide open lake in the direction the wind was to be howling. Thought they may end up trolling before swimming back to shore!... not that that has ever happened on Simcoe!!
662415,Roy,2012-02-01 05:06:00,13728," Roger, think of it as job security. For you that is."
662416,irishfield,2012-02-01 05:08:00,26272, Not many will get that... but that's funny right there!!
662419,Sinker,2012-02-01 05:46:00,8692, Lots of ice here today....and no wind at all. Not even a track:canadian:      S.
662428,asdve23rveavwa,2012-02-01 13:06:00,2690,  Those are two beautiful pics... darn (and I don't mean darn  )this working for a living!
662430,Machine57,2012-02-01 13:13:00,22,  Hey Chuck!!..Had a great time out today with RR and you. Nice to finallymeet you!..Send me your info @ PM and I will hook up with you for some more fishing. I work opposite to RR so there are lots of days off between the two of us to go out with you if interested. Regards Dan aka..Machine57
662481,irishfield,2012-02-01 15:53:00,26272, Yah... and that's not bear point on Simcoe either!  Nice fishies....
662490,Sinker,2012-02-01 16:09:00,8692," No, it clearly is not  Just trying to get the point across that there is lots of ice in places other than simcoe. Simcoe is not the only lake in ontario.....I'm not sure a lot of people here realize this or not??  Get on your horse and go for a drive. There is lots of perfectly safe ice out there, just go find it. I'd rather be where I was than simcoe any day!!  S."
662505,BillM,2012-02-01 17:34:00,17367,Sweet Haliburton brookie!  Good job man.
662528,irishfield,2012-02-01 18:20:00,26272,"  Why I suggested he rethink it Shayne, Kris knew what I was saying I'm sure. Lot of places to go with safe ice.. that is for sure!  "
662556,Harrison,2012-02-01 19:39:00,2202, Awesome   .
662723,Live2fish85,2012-02-02 02:34:00,1633,Heading to cooks tomorrow hope the fishing is good.
662726,BillM,2012-02-02 02:44:00,17367,"Steelhead tomorrow for me, screw this crappy ice fishing season!"
