662902,206,2012-02-02 16:18:00,563,I have no problem with the extra paper we have to carry with this new system  
662904,mike rousseau,2012-02-02 16:21:00,4661,nice
662967,SirWhite,2012-02-02 19:46:00,210,Gotta love new technology
662977,Thrilla,2012-02-02 20:25:00,164,"mine is yellow. I see this being useless, not sure what was wrong with the sticker.... Then it was only one thing you needed, a card... Now it is a card but you must also preset the paper. Step backwards IMO"

662996,davey buoy,2012-02-02 21:57:00,5505,"And why don't you have any problems?,maybe I need my glasses,and you think this is a good move?."
662997,bassmaster4,2012-02-02 22:01:00,801,waste of paper
663005,NAW,2012-02-02 22:25:00,4022,"Mine is the exact same as before.  A printed tag on the back of my outdoors card.  3 year sport.  Right below my 3 year small game.  Glad I don't have to deal with the extra Bull of only being a fisherman  Unless I'm the only one like this.  I don't have this little weird thin card that people are talking about, or a peace of paper to carry along with it."
663012,irishfield,2012-02-02 22:30:00,26272,Buy three years at a time Nick.. and you skip the misery!
663108,dheitzner,2012-02-03 02:48:00,314,"I have the 3 year fishing, and it's the exact same as the last few that I've had, with no extra pieces of paper..."
663114,DaveMc,2012-02-03 03:08:00,89,"thats the only way to avoid the separate tag is to get a 3 year. then they print it on the card like they always have. when i heard they were doing this last year i was hoping they would do away with the outdoors cards, but they didnt"
663129,ctdd2006,2012-02-03 04:00:00,531, I only bought one Wayne and my card is the same as before.  I guess next year is when I have to double down????
663131,Frank,2012-02-03 04:00:00,74,"I didn't mind getting the yellow piece of paper, but I've only had it for a few weeks and it is getting wrecked already, now I have to find out if they will give replacements if it gets any worse."
663133,woodenboater,2012-02-03 04:06:00,2277,"I know it's a bit of work, expense and a pita, but I'd probably laminate it."
663232,Dave Bailey,2012-02-03 15:27:00,1641," Check with the ministry to see if that's legal, I know there are admonitions against laminating other government documents like birth certificates. I keep my stuff in a small zip-lock sandwich bag, waterproof and it prevents it getting beat up."
663257,JorgeCarlos,2012-02-03 17:08:00,109,"i just have my outdoors card minutes ago in the mail with 1 year sticker, nothing changed."
663265,DOS,2012-02-03 18:00:00,119,"Problem will be if you are a hunter also...card , paper for fishing, paper for small game, paper for deer, paper for bear, paper for moose, migratory tag, pal and regestration papers.  Can you say Costanza wallet....    On a side note, my system finally showed up, and it makes my life a whole lot easier, swipe a card, enter some #'s and print it out...Saves about 3hrs of reconciling the licences every month.    RED"
663283,DaveMc,2012-02-03 18:44:00,89," just make sure that if you reverse or void a licence the mnr actually reverses or voids it, they have been know to charge for the reversals now and again. have fun with it, i hope you dont run into any of the issues some of us have. and if you need to find a postal code LMAO they have one person available for it in Peterborough and you will never reach him when your customer is standing there waiting for their licence, and calling the outdoors card center is a crap shoot, (tech support, the only ones that actually are available all the time are no longer allowed to access the mnr files)  As well, the yellow slip you receive from an issuer or service canada isnt a paper slip, it is what the mnr calls ""durable stock"" and is plastic. attached is a pic of a blank tag that i tried to tear in 2.
