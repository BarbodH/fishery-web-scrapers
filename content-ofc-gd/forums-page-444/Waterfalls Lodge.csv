663356,rmarentette,2012-02-03 22:54:00,124,Thanks Carp. We've gone up to Gowganda the last three years and wanted to try some place new. Never fished in that neck of the woods. We've fished around Temagami several times over the years as well. Always great to get out of the city and get some fresh air!! Cheers to you as well.

663407,irishfield,2012-02-04 02:06:00,26272,"I came to the conclusion.. after many visits camping with the kids about 15 or so years ago+.. that there's no fish in the lake below the falls, but I've heard that the chain of lakes above is pretty good."
663417,registerfly,2012-02-04 02:22:00,198," that's odd to hear. it was ""the"" spot last year when we went. Most bass and PB walleye."
663419,irishfield,2012-02-04 02:27:00,26272,"Maybe they all washed down in the last decade! lol We always stopped there on our almost yearly round robin up or down hwy 17 and 11 to Fushimi in Hearst. We'd spend about two days there each year and always had the campsite right beside the ""launch"" on the lower lake."

663495,rmarentette,2012-02-04 15:35:00,124,Yes. It's the first time we've fished in that part of Ontario.
