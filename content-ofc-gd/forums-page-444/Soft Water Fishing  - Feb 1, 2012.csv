662887,superdad,2012-02-02 16:00:00,353,"Holy Cow!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! There it was soft water and an open ramp.......  Laker John and I hit the really open water on Wednesday, the 1st of February for two reasons.  1. Never fished from a boat in February  2. Wouldn't have to ice fish in February to maintain our fishing in every month of the year.  Got the boat in the water after by-passing a truck and boat trailer left in the middle of the ramp - some people are not considerate of anyone else.  Had the rods out by 0900 and saw a couple of other boats doing what we were doing - fighting the wind and the waves.    Trolling in John's tinny was getting tricky and we made a pass down wind and one up wind, then thought there might be a lee on the south side and headed over there to discover it was same. Trolled down to Keith Shoal, pulled the lines and headed back to the north side, The waves were gettting larger and we were bouncing pretty good, so we decided that discretion was the better part of valour and headed for the ramp. Took the boat out at 1230.  Our results were a skunk, but we saw the net a couple times on one of the other boats.  So that's our fishing in Quinte for February, the state of the ice makes me concerned and have decided to pass on the rest of the ice season and get our hooks sharpened for the browns in March.  Stay Tuned  David  aka  Superdad"

662905,Harrison,2012-02-02 16:26:00,2202,"Looking at that boat, I surely doubt we have to go to far from this forum to know who it is!"
662928,superdad,2012-02-02 17:54:00,353,"Mike  the launch ramp at Bath is wide open.  Hope that helps, Plus or nearly plus all weekend......  David  aka  Superdad  any chance of you letting us know where we can launch??  PMs welcome... please.... "
662929,mike rousseau,2012-02-02 17:56:00,4661,Thanks superdad
662931,johnnyb,2012-02-02 18:01:00,3413,"Simply amazing....don't give up on the trolling for the rest of the month though, Superdad....these reports are too good to miss"
662984,Lungelarry,2012-02-02 21:13:00,294,"Hey Superdad, I,m one of those guys in the pic. To bad you couldn,t have stayed,it was a SUPER day,but your right ,that wind was crazy. Congrats for just being out on Feb 1, but that boat was just alittle small for that day. I,m not going to tell the story because the boys are still out today ( just one long day for me is enough,getting too old for this).Heres just one pic,not to make you feel bad,but just to let you know,they were there.

662991,Joeytier,2012-02-02 21:28:00,3990,"Sweet!  It sure has been a terrible year for quinte ice (obviously), but thankfully farther back in the bay there's still some hard stuff to chase the pigs on."
663014,bucktail,2012-02-02 22:32:00,1857,WAY TO GO!!!!!! That takes planning and will power as well as good clothes!  Darren
663020,JoshS,2012-02-02 22:44:00,729,Good on you for getting out there and keeping us posted!
663022,JoshS,2012-02-02 22:49:00,729," Interesting shot, I like it. Nice pigs!"
663070,EC1,2012-02-03 00:58:00,930,":thumbsup_anim: Nice fish, and even if you skunked, I'm jealous you even got to go softwater fishing. Either let me get onto laker ice or let me bring out my canoe!"
663073,superdad,2012-02-03 01:01:00,353,"Glad to see the fish landed were walleyes.  Yes, it was a bit much for our boat, but we only fished a while, trying to stay safe.  Thanks for acknowledging that there fish caught.  David  aka  Superdad"
