663017,DRIFTER_016,2012-02-02 22:38:00,10439,Fish one line with dead bait suspended 1 to 2 feet off bottom and jig with your other line. Run either an airplane jig or Lindy darter tipped with a shiner or small smelt. If using the darter hook the bait so it hangs horizontal on the 2 trebles so it looks like a fish under a fish.
663037,Rizzo,2012-02-02 23:30:00,4754,"buy some suckers, buy some cheap tip ups. Attach sucker to tip up via line/hook, sit and wait for flag to pop up. Pretty much all it takes the spots I fish"
663066,Fishing 24/7,2012-02-03 00:52:00,709,is cooks bay part of a river or lake.  if river go shallow 4-5 ' of water hook a sweet    sucker over size the darn thing like WHAT!  hook it quick strike style and every 15-20 minutes lift the bait 1 ' to stir the smell of the daed bait.  if in a lake.  find a drop or hump with weeds.  go from shallow to 30 FOW again over size the minnow and move it around .  run and gun the bay like a BAWSS! dont stay in the same erea for 99 houre.  sometimes when you run and gun your drop the minnow right in there face and it will take you 2-3 minutes and youl have a BRUTE on your line!
663067,pics,2012-02-03 00:54:00,1268,I used to fish the south end a lot in 5-6 feet of water. Its a lot of fun when you can see them hit...
663071,Spouph,2012-02-03 01:00:00,115,  I am pretty sure smelt are Illegal in ontario.  I have to double check that though.
663076,Spouph,2012-02-03 01:05:00,115,Ya just double checked can't use smelt.
663094,DRIFTER_016,2012-02-03 02:10:00,10439, Salted shiners will work as a substitute.
