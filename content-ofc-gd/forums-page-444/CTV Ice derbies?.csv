657450,jedimaster,2012-01-17 17:54:00,3472,Anyone know the schedule for the 2012 ctv ice fishing derbies?
657457,BillM,2012-01-17 18:30:00,17367,Try ctv.ca
657467,jedimaster,2012-01-17 19:07:00,3472,Tried couldn't find anything on there.
657474,Leecher,2012-01-17 19:29:00,7832,Google's your friend  CTV Ice Derbies
657485,jedimaster,2012-01-17 20:04:00,3472,"No info yet apparently on the 2012 derbies. I talked to the guy that ran it last year, he gave me the number of the guy doing it this year. The new guy hasn't got the entry forms back yet, and there is nothing on the web about them yet apparently, and no website is setup for them. CTV will eventually start advertisising them, but apparently not yet. So in this case google is not my friend. Of course if you can find a link to the 2012 derbies and info for this year, please post them. I am sure others would like to know."

662729,ctdd2006,2012-02-02 02:49:00,531, Elliot Lake is Feb 25
662733,Nipfisher,2012-02-02 02:56:00,2449,  Temagami is on Net Lake which is 5 kms. North of Temagami. I heard there were less then 5 fish caught there last year and a ciscoe won the big prize.
