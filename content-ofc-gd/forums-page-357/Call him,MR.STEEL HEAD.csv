738738,fishnsled,2012-10-22 15:42:00,3520,"Nicely done gents! I would have liked to have seen that video if you had ""captured the moment"" Brian.... I'm sure Terry had a few choice words while thinking he had lost the fish... ."

738907,MJL,2012-10-23 01:50:00,2427,Congrats Terry   I plan to make a hero drift from 500m upstream down to where Terry is fishing and beyond...Thank goodness for the massive line capacity on my Islander and the power of the 13' 3pc XST  Did I mention I only plan to retrieve halfway back through Terry's pool before starting my next drift
738981,BillM,2012-10-23 12:33:00,17367,"Mike, make sure to give your float a big SNAP right at the end of the drift, gotta keep any fish in the pool he's fishing on their toes!  "

738558,Terry,2012-10-21 20:43:00,14456,"well  well  I set the hook on a few..I think but first one I had on   but it was Bull luck that I got it in   it made a run right at me and I thought I lost him, the line went slack  I stopped reeling till the float started moving"
