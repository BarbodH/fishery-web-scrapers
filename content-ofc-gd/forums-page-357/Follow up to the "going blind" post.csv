738453,Spiel,2012-10-21 12:14:00,9065,Just thought I'd share a couple of pictures of the finished wrap that I posted about here.....  http://ontariofishin...showtopic=65999  As I noted previously the end results would have a much darker appearance than the pre finish photos. So after two thin coats of finish on the end wraps to bring the surface level with the weaved thread and one coat over the entire area we now have this.....      
738454,lew,2012-10-21 12:17:00,12766,Almost too purty to get all slimey Chris....nice work !!!
738455,Roy,2012-10-21 12:21:00,13728,"Beautiful work, Chris. Looks similar to mine but I don't have a hook keeper on mine. I must say that it's the best muskie rod I have and the best I am likely to ever have."
738457,kemper,2012-10-21 12:25:00,2232,Fantastic Chris.  I'll have a little gem to share myself shortly...
738465,Ralph Field,2012-10-21 13:00:00,1018,That sir is amazing.
738471,Fish Farmer,2012-10-21 13:18:00,2234,Makes me want to make another order.   Forgot to tell you I caught that winning fish on your craftsmanship Spiel rod. Very nice bud.
738472,Live2fish85,2012-10-21 13:21:00,1633,"Chris, that looks awesome. I didn't think I liked that before but damn. Without the colour preserver that looks awesome. You sure know how build a rod. I can't stop using mine haha.  Is that the thread I have on mine?"
738477,Christopheraaron,2012-10-21 13:55:00,3525,Amazing work Chis! I too didn't really like it before but with that coat it's stunning!
738485,solopaddler,2012-10-21 14:17:00,8605,No wonder you're going blind.
738486,kickingfrog,2012-10-21 14:23:00,8333,"Careful, everyone is going to want one."
738489,Spiel,2012-10-21 14:47:00,9065,Thanks everyone.   I've had lots of guys ask for similar style wraps over the years Rob but they usually balk when I tell them how much.  
738518,John,2012-10-21 16:49:00,2956,"Wow Chris, simply amazing. I didn't really think it was my taste when I first saw it, but finished it's absolutely beautiful work!"
738519,spinnerdoc,2012-10-21 16:51:00,556,"That is just stunning and a really impressive show of thread work, it really is a work of art."
738521,misfish,2012-10-21 17:13:00,29133,Nice wrapping Chris.
738522,DT10Sam,2012-10-21 17:17:00,480,Simply brilliant Chris nice workmanship.    Sam
738540,Leecher,2012-10-21 19:23:00,7832,It turned out great    Awesome work Chris as always
738562,Spiel,2012-10-21 21:00:00,9065,"Thanks again all, truly appreciated. A lot of time and effort goes into these style of wraps with multiple coats of finish (several hours) and I still believe I'm not charging enough!  Oh and nice to see you on board the last few days Sam. I hope all is well?"
738573,ChrisK,2012-10-21 21:49:00,2772,Sweet work Chris. How long before I can put in my order for one of them
738577,mercman,2012-10-21 22:24:00,7054,Absolutely beautiful craftsmanship Chris.Such delicate work.I can really see what you meant by the colors getting darker and richer after the clearcoat is added.  Thanks for sharing your talent with us.
