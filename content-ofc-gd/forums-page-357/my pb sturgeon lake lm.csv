739716,MCTFisher9120,2012-10-26 12:55:00,3761,"Amazing largemouth, Sturgeon gave me one over 5 last September, awesome lake for sure. Yours looks bigger tho  Must of been nice pitching baits and locking into that one  Thanks for sharing,  MTBF  Edit* Hope it went back into the drink"
739718,ecmilley,2012-10-26 13:30:00,2163,"i don't know i just find it insulting to be told to have let that fish go, it may be that attitude the last few years that keeps the 350 pics or so in my computer and camera unshared. It should be obvious the bait and 1 oz tungsteen weight is still in its mouth, I ran up my steps and the 50 ft to the house to get quick pictures to run this impressive fish back into the lake, as fish like this deserves to be caught more than once. as for weight it was a 6 or bigger, wasn't keeping it out of the water longer than i had to decision was photo or weigh it. here is a pic from earlier in the year big bass was 5.1 on the digi before i sent them on there way.
