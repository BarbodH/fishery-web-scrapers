739462,jedimaster,2012-10-25 11:17:00,3472,I believe that once you do take off after it you must unload your gun.
739690,Sinker,2012-10-26 04:39:00,8692," Does that make sense to you?  How do you dispatch a wounded bird with an empty gun?   As long as your not out chasing birds around, and then shooting them, its all good. Retrieving game has a different set of rules. You must use any means possible to retrieve crippled birds.  S."

So for the Skipper the answer is a DEFINITE YES, you can fish and hunt if you're doing everything else legal....waterfowl / migratory birds (they are not always the same thing) have MANY more rules to follow then most upland bird hunting because of international treaties between many other countries...

All of a sudden, his line bends in half as if he had been drifting and was snagged on bottom. He set the hook and brought to the surface what he thought was a huge log. To his marvel, a giant walleye came to the surface and he quickly net it. It turned out to be the biggest walleye he had ever caught at a whopping 14 pounds!!!"

739131,jedimaster,2012-10-24 01:17:00,3472,"I believe and don't quote me on this that there are provincial additions to restrictions on hunting from a boat. I believe that there used to be this stipulation of the motor out of the water in Ontario at some point. It is still in effect in some provinces.  For ontario it states that you are not allowed to hunt from a boat accept under the provisions of the migratory bird act circa 1994. All guns in a boat must be unloaded unless you fall under those provisions. So while you are fishing your guns must be unloaded and you must follow the rules of transportation. Now there was some debate at some point that when the boat is no longer in motion your guns must fall under the storage laws. I was told trigger lock them to be safe as then you will comply no matter what, however I don't believe this is actually law. Again we all know that sometimes its better to be safe than in front of a judge pleading your case.  http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/stdprodconsume/groups/lr/@mnr/@fw/documents/document/251888.pdf Page 24 Top left paragraph    A bit further down on the same document as above     As for the migratory bird act... It specifically states that you are NOT allowed to hunt from a motor boat...However the stipulation as follows....  http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/C.R.C.,_c._1035/page-1.html   This is the provision that allows you to hunt from a powerboat/motor boat as long as the boat has stopped moving and the motor is off.  This also includes your electric trolling motor which must also be turned off and afaik from the last time I talked about this that means it has to be off and the momentary switch must NOT be operational. Momentary on means idle and motor is operational."
739134,dhickey,2012-10-24 01:36:00,1038,Ok. If I am an angler/hunter can I go fishing and have my gun in the boat with me ? Catch my limmit of(whatever)fish I want and hunt or shoot prey at the same time as long as I follow the regulations governing hunting or fishing weather it be fish or wild life?  Can you have your surf and turf and eat it to??  Personaly I dont think you should. I think that a person would be at risk to not only themselves but any one in the boat with them. Fishing rods and tight lines wouldnt mix well with guns in a boat.  My father always told me growing up that you werent aloud to have a gun in a boat unless you were hunting. Made sence to me at a young age and still does.  Your either hunting or fishing not both...
739137,ch312,2012-10-24 01:56:00,1590,"jigging up some fish and shooting passing waterfowl at the same time is what i call one hell of a day. i've never even thought of this before, but talk about excellent timing. i'm heading to long point next week so i guess mr. 870 is going for a boat ride  birds seem to know when they're safe and usually have no issues passing by a fishing boat, but will steer clear of a guys hunting. i'm thinking you may be onto something with fooling wary birds"
739140,Skipper D,2012-10-24 02:48:00,1970,  I have a funny feeling SD that rule was made up just for you way back when so somebody would'nt have to worrie about some of your ideas .......... lol
