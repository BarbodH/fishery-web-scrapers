730192,Christopheraaron,2012-09-16 13:53:00,3525,"Yesterday Redpearl and I went out to one of my favourite local lakes for some pike in my canoe. This lake is only about an acre big and so it receives very little pressure compared to some lakes like Wilcox. The main fish in this lake would be bass, pike and big crappie, but of course there are pumpkinseed, bluegill and some rockbass as well. On this day we both felt like using bait instead of casting all day, which was probably a good idea because it was pretty cold starting out. At first we just started catching small bass, but then I flipped a jig and minnow under a dock when out of nowhere a pike came out and turned on it, well I missed him but wasn't going to let him get away, I dropped it down again and again he makes a big commotion, turns on it and I land him.<br><br><img src=""http://i1148.photobucket.com/albums/o577/minientrepreneur/Pikereport1.jpg""><br><br><br>It was very slow after this, so we headed over to the other sid of the lake, it's a shallow flat with a large drop next to it, perfect ambush spot. Well I ask redpearl to hand me a minnow and of course he hands me the absolute smallest minnow we have (less then an inch) so I cast it to the flat and it goes down, just a little bass, but as I'm reeling it in, my rod just bends over, and I manage to reel in a giant pike who grabbed that little bass, but of course he let go just after we saw him.<br><br><img src=""http://i1148.photobucket.com/albums/o577/minientrepreneur/pikereport3.jpg""><br><br><img src=""http://i1148.photobucket.com/albums/o577/minientrepreneur/pikereport2.jpg""><br><br><br>Undiscouraged Redpearl took his largest treble and the largest minnow we had under my pike float and cast it to where we saw the fish, and sure enough slowly the float goes down, he waits a few seconds and then gives it a hard set, and we land in my fish! For both of us this was a pb, a shared pb. It measured 25"" I know that 25"" isn't that big for most of you but keep in mind that this lake really is more like a very small pond. Red ate it last night and hs a steak waiting for me in the freezer. <img src=""http://ontariofishingcommunity.com/forums/public/style_emoticons/default/thumbsup_anim.gif""><br><br><img src=""http://i1148.photobucket.com/albums/o577/minientrepreneur/pikereport4.jpg""><br><br><img src=""http://i1148.photobucket.com/albums/o577/minientrepreneur/pikereport5.jpg""><br>"

730233,chrismarkz,2012-09-16 18:51:00,20,is that bond lake you are fishing?
730235,Christopheraaron,2012-09-16 18:56:00,3525,Not allowed to fish bond.
730243,Dave Bailey,2012-09-16 19:28:00,1641,"If that's where I think it is, good haul!"
730250,Christopheraaron,2012-09-16 19:58:00,3525,"Ya, definitely good for that lake, but I'm sure that there is bigger."
730252,Joey,2012-09-16 20:28:00,9122,Nice going
730255,davey buoy,2012-09-16 20:42:00,5505,"Nothing wrong with those fish Chris,looks like a good day to me!"
730334,northernpike56,2012-09-16 23:42:00,717,"Nice job! The 25"" looks really fat, and cool pics of the chewed up bass too! lol  Matt."
730337,Christopheraaron,2012-09-16 23:45:00,3525," Yup, very fat fish. I should've let him eat the whole bass the first time. LOL"
730359,Andrew Grant,2012-09-17 00:41:00,201,.
730508,adolson,2012-09-17 14:43:00,783,That pike looks tasty! And I don't usually say that about pike.
739065,jronald22,2012-10-23 19:09:00,2,"I've fished that spot many times with good luck some nice size pike in there. The only problem is that one time I was approached by a lady saying that its private property and that we aren't allowed to fish their, just a heads up to anyone planning on going to that spot again."
739119,ADB,2012-10-24 00:07:00,444,I know this spot well.  Cherish it and keep the location under your hat...there aren't many like it left.
739143,Christopheraaron,2012-10-24 03:04:00,3525," I've only brought 2 people to it, I'm actually surprised this many people know it! Yes I know all the property specs of the lake too so I'm fine for that lady."
739147,d_paluch,2012-10-24 03:32:00,343,"I like secrets  let me in haha  Even though this report is a month old I must say that is a fat pike @ 25"". I gotta get out there and find me some small relatively unknown lakes nearby. Mountsberg is good and I have yet to be skunked there, but I hate seeing all of the garbage there, let a lone all the people fishing (often illegally).  I actually saw someone on Mountsberg with a little 2-4hp outboard. What a tool, no excuse for that as there is a BIG sign stating the rules of the lake"
739150,jronald22,2012-10-24 06:05:00,2," What do you mean your fine for the lady?  Just wondering, because I'm not the first person that she's told to leave, there are countless others. I assumed that I could access the lake but hopping over or under the guard rail so that I don't step on some ones property. I thought as long as the water was a certain amount of feet from the road that I could fish it. I guess she figured otherwise and was going to call the cops, funny though a cop came by one night as I was fishing there and didn't say a peep, all he asked was if I caught anything yet."
739165,Christopheraaron,2012-10-24 12:26:00,3525,"There are some weird rules there, and it turns out that shore is private, but not the forested area."
739267,mercman,2012-10-24 18:56:00,7054,Nice clean healthy looking Gator  Love their aggression this time of year.Even the little ones wil scare the beejessus outta ya when they hammer your lure.   Thanks for sharing.     Paul
