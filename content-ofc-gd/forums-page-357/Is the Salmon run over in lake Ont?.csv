738868,hotsky,2012-10-23 00:19:00,400,I have a day off tomorrow and deciding where to go fishing. A budy of mine went to Bronte couple of times of times this past week and did well for salmon. I've never fished Bronte so thought about giving it  try but wondering if it's too late for salmon now?
738871,dave524,2012-10-23 00:23:00,4508,"The Chinook are pretty much done but I find fresh runs of Coho sporadically during the fall right up to freeze up, IMHO they are a better fish on the spawning run anyway."
738882,Christopheraaron,2012-10-23 00:46:00,3525,Check my report and tell me.
738884,hotsky,2012-10-23 01:02:00,400,"Just looked up your thread, nice fish, but man that little stream in the background is Bronte everyoone talkes about?!"
738886,MJL,2012-10-23 01:19:00,2427,"For the most part, the salmon are done. There’s a number of places along the north shore of Lake O that get stocked and will have zombies all the way into December. On that note, there are way better things to fish for aside from salmon that aren’t half dead nor fight like a dead log in the current.  Back in the day, the majority of cohos used to run after Thanksgiving till early January in most rivers I fished. Can’t say the same thing for the current generation of cohos running up Lake O rivers now. The last 3-4yrs, it seems they’ve started running alongside the first runs of Chinooks going up the river. On my local rivers, they’re mostly done as well. Unless the vast majority of cohos I've seen the last 3-4yrs are strays from the Credit stockings, we could be in for an amazing wild coho fishery for a number of rivers."
738897,kemper,2012-10-23 01:38:00,2232,  Didn't MEA take over coho stocking in 2008? I suspect the returns this year (insane) were from that year class?  I don't think that project lasted long though....
738915,hotsky,2012-10-23 01:59:00,400,"I'm a little stumped about tomorrow lol... I got skunked at the Grand, Harbour even at Mountsberg last time I fished them  Where should I go?"
738919,MJL,2012-10-23 02:08:00,2427," I do remember reading about potential coho stocking in various Lake O rivers aside from the Credit in a few newspapers. After communicating with John Kendall last year, the plan to stock those rivers in 2008 never came to fruition. Also looking at the Lake O coho stocking records from 2008 through till this year, it confirms it."
738923,kemper,2012-10-23 02:14:00,2232,"  I have a file on my computer somewhere that listed the rivers and the numbers they got...I'll see if I can dig it up. I may be wrong that it was MEA, but there was some type of stocking (non-MNR) that happened in 2008 unless I'm losing my marbles.  I hope I'm wrong, if these coho runs are natural I'll jump for joy."
738925,MJL,2012-10-23 02:20:00,2427," Starting in 2008, there was supposed to be a stocking of 2 additional rivers with cohos supplied by Ringwood (MEA)...Apparently that never did happen."
738927,kemper,2012-10-23 02:24:00,2232," Yeah that's all I can seem to find too, I must have read the articles that reported it would happen..."
738930,John Bacon,2012-10-23 02:25:00,3277,The MEA is still stocking coho's. We stocked the credit a few weeks ago. Currently we only stock the credit. We need to establish a good brood stock there since there were a few years where stocking did not occur on the Canadian side at all.  The CRAA may also raise some coho for stocking into the credit this year as well.  There is still a possibility of stocking rivers other than the Credit; but I don't think that will happen until at least 2014.  I would expect to see significantly bigger runs of coho starting next year.
738935,hotsky,2012-10-23 02:42:00,400,this thread is getting kinda offtopic... anyone wants to help with post #7?
738936,Christopheraaron,2012-10-23 02:47:00,3525,"Take a drive to the notty, it's worth it."
738938,kemper,2012-10-23 03:10:00,2232,  You'll have a hard time getting such specific location - get out there and cover some water
738942,northernpike56,2012-10-23 03:21:00,717,  credit?
738948,hotsky,2012-10-23 03:57:00,400,"Kemper im deciding on a body of water (river, lake etc) rather than asking for a spesific location.  Notty? Im not sure i know what that is..."
738969,Live2fish85,2012-10-23 11:35:00,1633, It is fishing not catching. You could be using the wrong baits not just location.
738994,chuckymcd,2012-10-23 13:32:00,144,"wouldnt bother with the credit, The notty would be my choice, but tough river to fish if you have never been there.  Good luck"
739011,hotsky,2012-10-23 14:41:00,400,Thanks guys. im wating to till i catch something report worthy pefore i post a report. Dont want to embaris myself posting about some small fish i caught ...i did post a couple before tho.
739632,HyperActive,2012-10-26 00:00:00,56,"Gray I feel your pain. I am ""Jonesing"" so bad to catch a large mouth it isn't funny. I need to find a place soon to. The place I spent my summer at closed for the season a few weeks back and I have done a few road trips with little success.   Have you ever asked the owners of the golf course coming into Hamilton from Brantford if they allow fishing in the off season, it looks like bass heaven and a fairly easy place to fish for a beginner like me.  I keep meaning to but I am pretty sure I won't like the answer,"
739649,hotsky,2012-10-26 01:04:00,400,
739709,Rich,2012-10-26 11:46:00,3927,"Yah. Fishing location is like 5% of the puzzle of catching fish. Try learning cold weather techniques, instead of travelling to where it's easiest? I would stray no farther than the harbour in the fall if i still lived in hamilton. Its full of fish of all species."
