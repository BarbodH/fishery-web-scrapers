The pike are agressive this time of the year.   getting ready for winter.  there Huge feed bags .  and the True size of a canadian northern pike!     This fish Ripeed a 1 1/4 onze spinner bait to shreds.    with a bass net. it had to be folded in half to fit .    I didnt expect two Brutes like these today.  Considering it was a Small mouth frenzy day!    Over size was the key!  :worthy:  :worthy:    might hit this lake a couple more times befor the season ends.  stay tuned
