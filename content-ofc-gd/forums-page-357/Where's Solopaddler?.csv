Or have to work ..............naaah!"
739715,Roy,2012-10-26 12:55:00,13728,"While others wait for reports, Mike is out fishing today."
739719,jimmer,2012-10-26 13:48:00,2730,"He is probably fishing in one of your dream locations, while you are wondering where he is! LOL"
739720,BillM,2012-10-26 13:56:00,17367," It's not even Halloween yet man, lol!   October isn't known to be a killer month for chrome.."
739755,blaque,2012-10-26 18:15:00,2419,Kinda weird
739804,solopaddler,2012-10-26 23:47:00,8605," Nah not really. I know Harold (knuguy), he's just playing around.  Today was stellar, not huge numbers but a bunch of real quality fish that fought like they were possessed.  Was also glad to finally drag Spiel out of the rod shop for a day, Lord knows the man needed a break.  I think I killed him though, he was in knots the entire drive home."
739813,Christopheraaron,2012-10-27 00:27:00,3525,Report on the way?
739819,misfish,2012-10-27 00:34:00,29133," I can testify to this. The spring run,is nothing like the fall run. They are bulls. Im learning again. Yes,I got a few knuckles banged this fall. Nice to see Chris got out. Hmmmm think there was an invite. LOL"
