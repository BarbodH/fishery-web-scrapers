739054,Headhunter,2012-10-23 18:04:00,5703,"  Oh, I've seen the ""good"" that being tied down to a cell phone can bring. Just take a walk through a restaurant, a mall or any other place where humans used to actually speak to each other and you will find that the vast majority of people are ignoring the people they are out with and texting someone else. Frankly I find the whole attitude rude and ignorant. Go ahead, spend your life with a tiny machine that tells you what to do and how to do it... not happening for me. I could relate a story about a friend who can't go one minute without their phone, even on a fishing trip. Really, is that necessary? I simply don't agree that these devices are time savers, they are time vampires and those of us who value face to face time are going to continue to avoid them... and don't even get me started on all of the folks I see on the road talking and texting... once again, selfish, rude and ignorant. Those of you who think their life is better as a result of this technology, have you really taken a look at it objectively or perhaps you have not graced this planet long enough to have thrived without one. Does your life style really require you and everyone within your circle to have immediate attention or results? If so, perhaps a re-look at your life choices might be in order. JMHO! HH"

Prior to having one, I spent a great deal of time each week hunting down pay phones that actually worked, and making sure I always had a bunch of quarters to feed them with. I no longer need to do that. Having a cell phone makes my life easier and more convenient.  And yes, my work lifestyle does require me to stay in fairly continuous contact. Note I emphasize ""work"" lifestyle. That's why I have a cell phone, for the most part.  I do not feel the need to re-examine my life choices, given that I am lucky enough to have a job that many people would give their eye teeth for.  To each their own. But understand that not everyone who uses a cell phone is ignorant, nor are they owned by it. It does have an on/off button. Whether people choose to use that is up to them."

Plus, I'd probably lose the thing...assuming I even remember to bring it with my when I leave the house...which I rarely would.  Also, there's no service at my camp.

739283,spoon,2012-10-24 20:07:00,74," Its a lot of money for a 3 year plan on a smart phone.  It's a jail term.  Current plans, $65 ($70) with tax for a 1 gb data, 200 min with evenings and weekends free from 6 pm to 7am + $200 phone + 3 years = equals $2540. If you go over anything in your plan it adds up even more every month, and you will ($10 extra a if you go over 1 gb in a particular month).   Mobilicity, public mobile and Wind are good if you use your phone within the city since their coverage area is small. Most of their plan sales go for $20 a month unlimited everything, but unlimited is more like 3 gb of data, if you reach that they will cap you.  Compared to states, my friend is with one of the biggest carriers in the states, pays $45 with tax unlimited data, unlimited talk within US, unlimited text nationwide with an Iphone 4s on a 2 year plan. There is no 3 year plans in the states.  I recently wanted to sign up, but I won't with the current plans. Over the next 3 years $2500 buys me a lot of good things that I'll need more then a cellular phone."

Funny story, I received a charge of 25 cents on my Rogers bill some time ago. I called Rogers to find out what the heck that was doing on my bill, they said that I received a text. I said that I did not recall receiving a text and if I did, I wouldn't know how to access it and that I was not going to pay them a dime, because for all I know, it was Rogers who sent me the text. They insisted that I had to pay. I insisted that I speak to a manager. Got the manager on the phone, told him to review my account, notice NO TEXTS EVER and he dropped the charges.

A cell phone is just another tool. You can turn it on or off as you wish, and it doesn't have to interfere with your life unless you want it to.  And it's a fantastic tool!  Aside from the emergency assistance it offers, it can save you a lot of time and effort.  Here's one simple example.... next time you change the oil on a motor vehicle, record in your cell phone the filter model number, oil grade and number of litres, and you'll never have to look it up again. Same thing for wiper refills. And the date/mileage you did that oil change. And wheel bolt torque settings. And licence plate numbers and VINs. And the paint code on your garage door. And the spark plug make and heat range from your outboard. And the lower unit gear oil weaight.  And each time you think of something you need from Canadian Tire, enter it. Next time you're in CTC, pull up the list of 5 things you need but would have forgotten.  next, enter your list of stuff that you like to take on a fly in fishing trip. When you discover you missed something, add it too, and never make that list again or forget to take something...  Don't shy away from a tool that works so well."

I am a printer. I have unlimited access to free paper. You should see all the writing pads I have stashed at home and the cottage. Most of the stuff you suggested I enter into a phone I already write down on a pad of paper and keep track of things that way. Yes the pad of paper might be at home when I'm out and need to remember something I wrote on it. It happens and somehow I live with it. My methods work for me so I see no need at the moment to get a phone...it's as simple as that.  Every baker has there way of baking a cake.
