Image http://www.icefish.com/catalog/include/image_resize.php?h=252&w=300&img=/product_images/TBM-6.jpg  Each door opens individually.  The shipping from USA is a killer.  Looking for somewhere in Canada. I have contacted HT. I'm interested in buying a few of the small ones (TBM-6 1"" x 1"" compartments).  I once found them at Gangon's but no more. Centerpin doesn't have them. Thanks"
