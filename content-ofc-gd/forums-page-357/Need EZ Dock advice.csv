739045,Roy,2012-10-23 17:23:00,13728,I have no idea but you asked that same question on the BOC board 7 years ago...has no one helped you yet?  My best advice would be to go to an EZ Dock dealer and ask them about any tips for dismantling. Good luck.
739053,irishfield,2012-10-23 18:02:00,26272,"Can someone stand beside you and hold a wide ""coal"" shovel under to catch everything? How do you put it back together in the spring? Water is warmer now than it is then...."
739059,whiskywizard,2012-10-23 18:30:00,305,"  I've asked my dealer.  Just because the dealer doesn't have a technique doesn't mean one doesn't exist. There are some clever people here.  BTW Roy, I asked this of my BOC buddies 2 days ago. Be careful what you say and do; you might be stuck in the future and not know it. Time loops are tricky things."

739086,Roy,2012-10-23 21:04:00,13728," Sorry Bud. When I read your thread this morning I had a couple of minutes and thought I'd try to help. So I Googled ""EZ Dock gusset removal"" and this is what came up.  http://www.baylinerownersclub.org/forum/showthread.php?74949-Need-EZ-Dock-advice  As you can see, I read your join date as your post date. Please accept my apologies.  Now back to my time loop."
739110,aplumma,2012-10-23 22:54:00,6896,"I found the answer in the link you provided.  ""EZ Dock’s modular, floating sections are quick and easy to install. Do it yourself, or hire an EZ Dock dealer to do it for you. ""  Hope this helps.   Art"
739161,DanD,2012-10-24 11:17:00,2223," Along the lines that Wayne mentioned. Get one of those blue plastic tarps, large enough to cover whatever section of dock youre working on.  Fish it under the dock and tie the edges to the dock or tie floats to the tarp eyelets. Dismantle and remove sections of the dock and then use your landing net to scoop out the gussets and hardware laying in the tarp????  Dan."
739162,mercman,2012-10-24 11:30:00,7054,"  most useful answer so far, or like Roy said, call them up and pick thier brains."
739422,ch312,2012-10-25 03:39:00,1590,"fish a piece of heavy line/wire through the hole and attach it to the connector rod thing and pull the rod up through each hole. maybe thread a small eye bolt into the end of the rod to attach the wire? rotate rod until ""puzzle piece"" fits in and then pull up to lock it in place so you can put on the top/nut.  i've never seen one of these thing's before, but i'm sure there's a way."
