The 2 dozen or more I had left I just dumped in the long grass near shore. When I went back the next day (it was quite chilly) there were my dead minnows. I chopped a few in half . .. .   they were taken just as enthusiastically as the day before when they were live. Ding, on goes the lightbulb? I've cleaned lotsa perch with the remains of smelts in their gullet, they take dead shiners . . . .  I figure live smelts would likely be good bait for perch, which I believe would not be legal? But . . . .   if I went to my local grocery store and bought FROZEN ones, and kept the receipt . . . .   would this be legal? Anybody else ever try frozen smelts? Did you catch whatever fish tou were targeting?"
739229,BillM,2012-10-24 16:47:00,17367,"Live smelts for perch?  The smelt in Simcoe are monsters...  I doubt the perch are feeding on them with any sort of regularity..  As far as perch are concerned, use exactly what you'd use through the ice."
739233,Photoz,2012-10-24 16:56:00,792,"I DID mention the smelts I would be using would be store-bought, and the question was ""Would they be legal to use . . . .   thank you?"
739234,irishfield,2012-10-24 16:57:00,26272,YES..
739236,BillM,2012-10-24 17:02:00,17367, Sure it's legal...  But you've probably be better off fishing with emeralds then 4-6in smelts for 13in perch.   I guess you could always take those un-used smelt you'll have at the end of the day and fry them up at home!  So it's a win/win in your case
739251,crappieperchhunter,2012-10-24 17:55:00,2582,"Freshco has frozen WHOLE smelts on sale this week. Grab a bag Steve and go out and enjoy some perching. I am sorry our one ""secret shore spot"" is no longer an option to you.  Happy perch hunting."
739270,iFish4real,2012-10-24 19:02:00,386,"when the frozen smelts were too big I was using just the tail half...worked like a charm every time  ...I even used perch tail when I ran out of bait, worked as well"
739274,BucktownAngler,2012-10-24 19:15:00,582,pinheads or shiners are probably cheaper and more effective for perch
739288,misfish,2012-10-24 20:28:00,29133,Shrimp steve. Buy a ring of them. Eat and fish at the same time.LOL  Serious. Their doing it all the time now.

739291,Skipper D,2012-10-24 20:37:00,1970,Whats it cost for a bag of smelts ?
739296,Rich,2012-10-24 20:58:00,3927,Double on the shrimp.. works wonders!
