739714,Harrison,2012-10-26 12:48:00,2202,Sweet bucket.  I know exactly where that is and fish those docks everytime I am on that lake.  You can see why now!  Hope you put her back!  kiddin.
739749,nancur373,2012-10-26 17:10:00,1211,of course it went back.
739752,Harrison,2012-10-26 17:54:00,2202," Figured as much, I'll see her again next year then!"
739796,nancur373,2012-10-26 23:22:00,1211,I only ask that you respect the swimming area as it is not roped off.
739811,nancur373,2012-10-26 23:59:00,1211,"I don't know how to do the measurement scaling thing but my oldest son (in the green) is 13"" across the shoulders and 7"" from inside the elbow to the wrist. Any suggestions?"
739817,Christopheraaron,2012-10-27 00:30:00,3525,I'm guessing 10-12?
