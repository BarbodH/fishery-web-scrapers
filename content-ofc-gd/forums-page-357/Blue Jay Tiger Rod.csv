This week I inlaid a few of these into a blue Tiger Wrap casting rod I am working on.  The rod blank is a Mag Bass 843, which means it's a 7' medium heavy rod, rated for 1/4 to 3/4 ounce  baits and best suited for Pitching, Jig&Pig, Spinnerbaits or Texas Rigs.  The cork pieces were hand made on my old lathe and the reel seat threads were shortened to exactly fit my Calcutta and Chronarch reels.  This is how it looks so far...    Feather detail...    Rear Tiger detail...    Front Tiger detail    Trimming the threads on the reel seat gets rid of about 1/2 inch of unneeded threads. I think it makes for a nice ""custom fitted"" look when the reel is attached.   Garry2R's"

Today was very windy, but it looks like things are calming down.  If that holds,  I'll water test it tomorrow."
