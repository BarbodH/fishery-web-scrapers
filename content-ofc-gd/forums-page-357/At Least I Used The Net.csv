A few bites here and there but nothing would commit to anything. Helped an elderly gentleman land the biggest bow of his life, good thing o brought my net. Was quite a fish, over 10 and he very much appreciated my help to land and release his catch. Moved to a different trib afterward, bottom bouncing a roe bag and hooked a big brown, but lost him rather quickly. I think he may have been inadvertantly flossed though, judging by the way it hit (slow, solid weight). So we got soaked for nuttin but at least the net got wet."
