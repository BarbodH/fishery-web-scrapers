Got skunked at Mountsberg, Harbour and Grand river on total of 6 or 7 outing. At the Grand I would have small fish practically bouncing off my lure and last few times I was lucky if I get one hit, also always had decent luck at the Mountsberg but last two times nothing! not even a bite. Is this the change in weather or I'm just having a bad streak? I thought fish esp pike become more active when it gets a little colder but couple of other people mentioned having better luck with pike in the summer.  Sorry for all the questions but I only started fishing in May so this is my fist fall fishing."

739639,Luke V.,2012-10-26 00:19:00,286,On days when it's nice and sunny look for bass to be shallow. (Their sun tanning)
739640,mercman,2012-10-26 00:20:00,7054,"Nope, not less fish. Time to change tactics. Go deeper, slower presentations, live bait where allowed, and fish structure.They are there, just not where they used to be."
739642,Dan668,2012-10-26 00:24:00,1120,"Killing the bass with squarebills and lipless cranks. Spinnerbaits being a close second. Shallow and deep, seem to be scattetered all over"

739648,hotsky,2012-10-26 00:59:00,400,Thanks will keep that in mind. Does that apply to pike as well? Wonder why the fish go deeper?
739653,Christopheraaron,2012-10-26 01:17:00,3525,"Warmer, following baitfish, more green weeds"
739662,dhickey,2012-10-26 01:37:00,1038,I have always had good results working drop offs and structure wheather it be logs /weeds or rocks a slow presentation of live bait or somthing that closely resembles live bait is a good way to start you will be suprised at what comes up. Keep it simple and dont be afraid to take a chance on lighter line and tackle but the hook set can get frustrating at times. Good luck.
