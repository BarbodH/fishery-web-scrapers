739241,Rod Caster,2012-10-24 17:10:00,5784,I have no idea but it sounds extremely suspicious haha
739247,irishfield,2012-10-24 17:30:00,26272,Doing water sampling..
739255,wallyboss,2012-10-24 18:14:00,1095,Is the river close to a Golf Course??
739256,adempsey,2012-10-24 18:14:00,1498,Collecting golf balls? Of course that wouldn't make much sense if the river you're talking about doesn't run through a golf course

739297,ecmilley,2012-10-24 21:12:00,2163,was there anyone following him carrying a keg of beer
739325,jedimaster,2012-10-24 22:39:00,3472,A Guy in his 70's with a 20 foot long funnel for kegging? Thats gotta be a first.   Maybe its for his ears so he can hear people you know an Ear Trumpet?  
739348,kickingfrog,2012-10-24 23:22:00,8333,WHAT????
