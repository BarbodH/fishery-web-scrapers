738254,mikeseb,2012-10-20 20:23:00,201,"Some stupid half head nook just broke my okuma aventa 15'6, if anyone has a bottom section to one ( maybe the top of yours broke) Consider it sold lol  If anyone knows of any rod repair places please post the numbers!!  I guess im on the fly for the next few days lol  ON THE PLUS WE GOT IT ON FILM,  VIDEO TO COME"
738263,Snidley,2012-10-20 20:50:00,620,Lorn Green used to tell guys no warranty for rods broken on 'Nooks. If the graphite is broken there is no repair possible. If there's a guide broken or a tip you can take it to Angling Specialties in Mississauga. Or see if Okuma is prepared to replace broken rods. Some companies will replace broken rods since rods cost peanuts once the tooling is set up.
738264,misfish,2012-10-20 20:51:00,29133,"Good luck with that.  I had no reply from Okuma,when my son broke his at the ferrul.BPS didnt even take it back.  It was the middle section.  I,ll be in contact with you,via pm, with pic,s of the bottom end."
738267,Snidley,2012-10-20 20:57:00,620,There's your best solution Oakvillebass
738286,mikeseb,2012-10-20 21:32:00,201,Thanks man I owe you one!!  Was it from a 15'6
738299,misfish,2012-10-20 21:58:00,29133,"My mistake,the top piece broke as you can see. the butt is in NEW condition.      15.6   And the break,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,  :wallbash:  Thats dust from storage.LOL  "
738370,jace,2012-10-21 00:55:00,472," If your rod is broken in the middle of nowhere, it's actually an easy fix with a graphite spigot.  You'll be lucky if your rod fits Misfish's rod because most rods, even of the same model, are different which is why warranty replacement sections from rod companies require you to send in all pieces -- it's for proper fitting.  A poor fit usually leaves sections rattling at the joint.  Misfish, your rod can also be fixed  by using a graphite sleeve but it will not be as inconspicuous as a spigot repair."
738383,hotsky,2012-10-21 01:27:00,400,I broke a 30$ Quantum rod and im guetting a new one for free. I think ill be buying more from that company!
738389,mikeseb,2012-10-21 01:44:00,201,"Really?  It might not fit?  How would I go about fixing mine ?  I called frank from bronte outdoor he said he knows a guy in brampton who can fix it for 40 bucks, theres another place near franks store that fixes rods as well and quoted me around the same price."
738409,kemper,2012-10-21 02:54:00,2232,"Those sticks are incredibly useless, if you can afford to just replace it.  When I started I picked up an Okuma Aventa. It blew up almost immediately, so I had it warrantied and it blew up again.  Lots of float rods out there of much higher quality for a good price!  If you want to keep it simply because you like the stick then it really isn't that big a deal to have it repaired. I'm sure you can find someone local to do it cheap."
738669,Rich,2012-10-22 10:34:00,3927,"The only float rod i ever owned that didnt blow up at some point was a quantum cold water i bought for 45 bucks at caledonia b&t.. good luck with your replacement but i agree with kemper, replace if you can afford it!"
738670,misfish,2012-10-22 10:37:00,29133,Let me know when your up this way.
738690,BillM,2012-10-22 13:23:00,17367,Time to get a proper rod for that river.
738707,mikeseb,2012-10-22 14:16:00,201,"For sure buddy, Im going to be getting a pfluerger 12'6 from someone on the forum to get me by (anyone have any experiences with this rod?), but I for sure want to replace the aventa for lager rivers and TROUT ONLY from now on haha  I now understand why a lot of guys have diff rods for salmon and chrome lol"
739093,Guest ----,2012-10-23 21:28:00,0,I have blown up a couple of Okuma wire dipsey rods. I took them back without a receipt and Natural Sports sent them back to Okuma where they were repaired and returned for $10 shipping charge. At least Okuma honors their warranty.  HIH
739102,misfish,2012-10-23 22:14:00,29133,"  Funny. I phoned and left a message,even sent an email of the pics. NADA.  Care to share a number for Natural Sport? Maybe they can help both Oak and I out."
739230,Photoz,2012-10-24 16:52:00,792,I've heard that Rockey's Bait & Tackle in Orillia is the designated Okuma dealer for Central Ontario . . . .    This might be a good number to call for information . . . .   apparently he's pretty decent to deal with? 705-325-3526.
739243,Snidley,2012-10-24 17:15:00,620,"There's a 17' Streamside for $100 and an 11'6"" Streamside for $90 on Kijiji Toronto. I don't know if they are good or bad rods however. Pflueger good reels but I don't know about float rods. ."
739244,BillM,2012-10-24 17:23:00,17367,Oakvillebassguy needs that 17' for Bronte
