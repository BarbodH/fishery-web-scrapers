739380,Live2fish85,2012-10-25 01:16:00,1633,Went down to 50 point today with the kids for a walk and fish a bit.  Sucks for the boat owner. http://imageshack.us/a/img17/6907/20121024182958.jpg  Hopefully it gets cleaned up soon.
739385,irishfield,2012-10-25 01:28:00,26272,Can only assume that's sitting on bottom or it would be the rest of the way down. Rain and dead batteries I bet.. or his prop shaft seals went.
739388,Live2fish85,2012-10-25 01:43:00,1633,Yea it is on bottom there. Water is down about 2' in there. I am not sure what caused it. I do know it is docked in another slip all summer and they have been pulling boats out now.

739436,Ron,2012-10-25 04:48:00,1683,"Through hull fitting failure? Not something I would look forward to seeing in the morning.  Bummer,  Ron..."
739439,irishfield,2012-10-25 04:50:00,26272, Yep.. could be a whole new meaning to a toilet backing up!!
739451,spincast,2012-10-25 09:11:00,3279,"oh,feel the pain in the wallet there boy. at least it happened at the end of the season:sarcasm:"
739525,Bigfisherman,2012-10-25 14:40:00,100,Hope they have a good insurer to cover that.
739594,Live2fish85,2012-10-25 19:07:00,1633,Was there again this morning and they had some divers there and other guys working trying to pump out the boat.  There is also a lot of gas or oil that you can see all around the marina in the water.
739605,Hooked,2012-10-25 20:13:00,891,"Was there last weekend and noticed that boat.  It's an older boat and was thinking, if they really fixed it up it would be pretty nice.  Now I see this, guess they should of fixed it up. Hopefully all oil\gas doesn't start killing off all the fish there.  Fingers crossed."
