739661,mikeseb,2012-10-26 01:34:00,201,Caught this lil jack today and was a little shocked when I saw this bulge on his side. I made sure not to touch the fish and released it as quickly as I could. Anyone know what it could be?

739673,chessy,2012-10-26 02:16:00,610,probably BKD  bacterial kidney disease not common in fresh water fish but it can happen biggest i have seen by the looks of the pic  nice to see it gutted... it will look like gravel in the black goop on the spine
