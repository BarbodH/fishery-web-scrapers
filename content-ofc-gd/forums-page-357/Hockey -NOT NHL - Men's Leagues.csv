739722,jedimaster,2012-10-26 14:23:00,3472,"Just wondering if anyone knows of any non contact mens leagues in the GTA looking for players. I keep thinking about playing again, and with the NHL on lockout I guess this may be the year I jump back in. Looking from something hopefully around the 401/404 area."
739738,addy79,2012-10-26 15:47:00,573,Most the leagues at Canlans have started. I'm at York U; check out Victoria park...

739745,bobowski,2012-10-26 16:38:00,360,The Adult Safe Hockey League(ASHL) is a good leauge to play in. They play out of Etobicoke Ice sports at Martin Grove and the 401. http://www.icesports.com/etobicoke/ashl.aspx
739748,jedimaster,2012-10-26 17:09:00,3472,"Was looking at ASHL's website, sent a few emails out. I think I would be about C level I think. But I haven't played in a long time, so I was thinking of joining a D league and see how it goes."
739753,Harrison,2012-10-26 17:56:00,2202," Ok, we are looking for one player, but a buddy was also in need of one for a C team.  I'll mention it to him and PM you if he still is."
