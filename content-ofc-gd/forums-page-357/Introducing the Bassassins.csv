739727,Bassassins,2012-10-26 15:10:00,111,"Hey everyone thanks for the support on my PB Walleye.... We came on board a few weeks ago and I wanted to make sure everyone had a chance to see what we do.  Hope you enjoy the video.... a couple of good outings earlier in fall.  My PB Walleye made it on camera and should show up in a later video.   ""Fallin for the Miss"" is showcasing sport fishing on the Mississippi River in Ontario. We are truly blessed to have such fantastic fishery right at our doorstep. This clip features the usual suspects that are to be caught this time a year. The smallmouth bass are gaining girth and feeding aggressively, the Walleye really seem to enjoy the cooler days of fall too, and pike are lurking around every corner all year long. Autumn is a wicked time to be out and about, not just to awe the breath taking spectacle when the trees are changing colour, also the cool and crisp mornings and noons are very much welcome after a hot, hot summer. The fishing seems to go in to overdrive as everything is preparing for the coming winter. Enjoy!  Thanks Bassassins www.thebassassins.com "
739729,BillM,2012-10-26 15:13:00,17367,Interesting.
739736,d_paluch,2012-10-26 15:44:00,343,"cool video!  love the strength and aggressiveness of river fish, especially in the fall! Music choice wasn't half bad, but I dont feel that dubstep and fishing mix...  great video though looks like you've had a fun fall thus far"
739742,captpierre,2012-10-26 16:14:00,2521,Well done!  Some substantial fish.  Didn't know the Mississippi had such a good fishery.  You mean we didn't have to spend  $30K on a boat to catch fish like that
739750,highdrifter,2012-10-26 17:12:00,2534,Noicely done!!  Us dubnstep fans want to know the name of that track!
739751,manitoubass2,2012-10-26 17:50:00,11391,"I didn't love the music, but the fishing and the editing of the video was awesome!!!!  I'd continue to watch these... Great job!"
739769,Bassassins,2012-10-26 20:43:00,111," For the non-fans just turn it down really low it sounds more chill that way.  For us that love if crank it up.. Makes you want to run, grab your rod and head to the river.  Song is ""I Follow Rivers"" - Dubs Remix.  Thanks everyone..."
739774,d_paluch,2012-10-26 21:13:00,343,"please don't take my comment above as if I don't like dubstep. I do, in the gym. Fishing is more relaxed  keep up the good work"

739779,misfish,2012-10-26 22:06:00,29133,"My uncle had a cabin on the river. We would catch pike and bass,and head out at night and fish the rice beds for cats.    Cool vid."
