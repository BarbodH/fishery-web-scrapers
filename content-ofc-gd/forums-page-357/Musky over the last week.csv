739356,rides85,2012-10-24 23:42:00,37,"Casting the 47 was suspended off a deep main lake point, the boat was in 50ft of water, and the other hit trolling over about 25ft of water trolling. We where marking bait in the top 10ft of water, so we switched over one line to blades to stay up high and it paid off."
