After reading many articles, posts and watching a few you-tube videos I think its time to try one. The Marcum unit looks interesting. Is there anyone who has this model or similar that can give me their opinion of it?  Thank you in advance IFH"
739699,Fisherman,2012-10-26 10:54:00,7201,"I had one for a couple of years, they work well.  The display is more along the lines of a regular LCD graph rather than the rotating rainbow headache.  They have a very good separation distance and will pick up the smallest of jigs in deep water."
739700,DaveMc,2012-10-26 11:13:00,89," i have played around with them in the shop, nice units for sure. the info i received from the guys at marcum tech. is if you havent used a flasher before, then the showdown unit is one you should look at, its easier for a beginner to read with the linear graph. If you do have experience using a flasher then you should probably stick with the L-series flasher as they are technically a better unit."

739837,Fishnwire,2012-10-27 02:16:00,983,"The Marcum LX-5 is the nicest sonar I've used on the ice.  I don't know why people say that circular display flashers are ""hard to read"".  The return is displayed in a curved line instead of a straight one...what about that is hard to read?  Any half decent sonar you get will change the way you ice fish."
