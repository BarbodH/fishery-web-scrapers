424147,MSBruno,2010-01-20 11:21:00,369,Anyone try this?  regrets or no looking back  thinking of doing this to my shimano chronarch  video
424163,Bill Shearer,2010-01-20 13:36:00,456,"I've changed over many Centerpin reels to the Ceramic hybrid ABEC 7s. Although noisy,(bearing rumble) they sure do make a huge difference. No lube is required, so cold weather doesn't affect the spin. Worth the effort and cost, IMO"
424173,BillM,2010-01-20 14:11:00,17367,  Why would your Chronarch need new bearings?    These bearing upgrades are more geared towards the float guys where bearings make a big big difference...

To gain any benefit you would have to have the system backed off all the way and a very educated thumb."
