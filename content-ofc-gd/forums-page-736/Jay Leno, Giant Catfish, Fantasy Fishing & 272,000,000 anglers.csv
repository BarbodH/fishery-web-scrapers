I must say though that you taking the Leno show doesn't impress me one bit. If he took your show now that would be an upward move for him. If Letterman offered you his show... now THAT would impress me.  Keep FYI going Bud...a great production.  And BTW, lose the catfish will ya?"
426018,Dave Mercer,2010-01-26 17:21:00,148,"Thanks Roy, I agree The Letterman show is much better than Leno. I would just want him to give it to me so I could give it back to Conan after Leno screwed him out of it! Glad you like FYI but why no love for the catfish? Dave Mercer"
426032,Roy,2010-01-26 18:14:00,13728,"I like catfish jess fine, Dave. It's dem big fat 400 pounders that bother me a little. They make me feel a little inadequate. I don't care for fish that I can hollow out and live in with more standing room than I need. Plus, they have better whiskers."
426052,Harrison,2010-01-26 19:20:00,2202,"Awesome Dave!  Loving them with more and more following each episode!  I hear ya on the catfish Roy, your more of the Perchy type."
