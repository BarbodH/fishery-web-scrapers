Regretably the high cell stalled the bite the past 2 days but the weather was too beautiful to pass up. Tuesday's volunteers.  Rob  d""s squeze showing him how it is done  A couple of the  local thugs    Now if only the ice at the smelt grounds would firm up."
424798,johnnyb,2010-01-22 15:52:00,3413,Looks good!!!  I'd love to go for some smelt through the ice....I heard they were in pretty thick by Fishmaster's last week....but I don't think the ice is holding up too well down there right now...

425363,bigfish1965,2010-01-24 17:23:00,3382,Do the smelt still come into Ramey's Bend?
425381,rockfish,2010-01-24 19:08:00,91," I believe there is good numbers of smelt at Ramey's Bend every Winter, Rick."
425392,tilly,2010-01-24 19:50:00,32,  They were there last year...would basically bite an empty hook!
