425448,bushart,2010-01-24 22:51:00,2628,Well Leechman has  been hard at it spinning out wooden fishing lures.  I asked if I could take a shot at painting a pattern on them ----basically cause I never have tried it.  I tried 4 different things that I've had success in fish catching so I went with those.  Here they is....   1.  Purple Swirly (Diving Crank)    2.  Snake in Da Grass  (Spook style walker)    3. Frog Walker (Spook Style walker)    4. Fatboy  (Diving Crank)    Bushart
425449,Leecher,2010-01-24 22:57:00,7832,Incredible Terry      Absolute great craftsmanship  You certainly know how to turn a dull wooden color plug into a true reality  I love it!!!  AWESOME WORK MAN   :clapping: Leechman
425450,splashhopper,2010-01-24 22:57:00,2931,"Dayummm.... those look good.... If I were a fish,,, i would eat em  Leechman and Bushart Inc...  How much are all four of those... i'll take a set !"
425461,Leecher,2010-01-24 23:24:00,7832, Don't ask me.... ask the man of honor for the amazing art work   :worthy:
425475,bushart,2010-01-25 00:17:00,2628,Well these belong to Leechman ---when I mail em.  They'll need varnish (Better than my art varnish-to hold up to fish) and hooks and eyes---anyway--they may be one of a kinders cause it's not gonna be very cost effective for selling at the speed I paint at.  Something different to try though.  Bushart
425499,fishindude,2010-01-25 01:26:00,220," Awesome job bushart, those look great!  Would you care to share the type of paint, and primer you used?  I'd love to give painting another try, my last attempt at painting homemade spooks came out like crap  Leechman, those divers look awesome, any idea on their approx. weight?"
425508,Leecher,2010-01-25 01:58:00,7832," Thanks fishindude!!!  The exact weight is:   3"" crank 10g  and 5"" crank 40g"
425543,Leecher,2010-01-25 03:26:00,7832,"Forgot to mention that the 5"" spook weights 15g and the 4"" 10g"
425561,Twocoda,2010-01-25 04:47:00,4130,i would think youll have to make another mount and keep these ones out of water Jacques  nice work bushart
425721,Leecher,2010-01-25 20:16:00,7832, You're absolutely right on that Twocoda.... those color patterns are too beautiful to have a fish scratch them....  I'll think of something nice to display them
425924,Spiel,2010-01-26 10:40:00,9065,"Very, very nice.  Are you using an airbrush Bushart?"
425949,bushart,2010-01-26 13:13:00,2628,Nah...just ole shakey hands  Bushart
