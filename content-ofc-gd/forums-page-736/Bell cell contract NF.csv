425327,Baldy,2010-01-24 14:37:00,44,"No easy way out of your predicament.  Do you not have a spouse, child, girlfriend or whatever that could use the phone?  Would be cheaper to subsidize someone else using the phone. I got rid of Bell Mobility years ago when we had 2 phones, service was ridiculous, no help from them at all, had no contract but could not negotiate any better deals. Funny thing was after we switched to Telus (3 Blackberry Mike phones, 3 Mike flip phones, Bells loss) Bell called my new number a few times wanting to know why we switched & offering a better deal, better rates, better service and my answer was.... ""Why didn't you offer this to me when I was still your customer?"" Got rid of Bell Canada as well after 3 weeks of heavy static, intermittent phone service and numerous technicians trying to fix the problem.  Mountain Cable now has our phone, fax & internet.  Cheaper, more features & way better service, comeone on the line that you can understand. Good Luck!"
425361,bassman87,2010-01-24 17:08:00,586,"Bell Canada Enterprise stock prices are constantly rising, they must be doing something right. And why don't you guys ever get familiarized with the service before locking into a longterm agreement, I don't get it. You sign up for the free phone then you get upset that the contract is actually a contract. I'm in no way a Bell nuthugger, but I do have Bell Mobility and I did sign a contract with them, only because I liked their service not because I got suckered with a free phone deal. \rant"
425371,rob v,2010-01-24 18:29:00,535,"The part that bothered me the most was the fact they can sign up 15 or 16  year old kids to contracts like this with the promise of a free phone. The plan they get signed up with usually ends up costing them two or three times as much as they understood because of all the exceptions and add-ons.  Then they get lousy credit reports when they finally figure out they're getting hosed.   And I""m not sure Bell's any worse than the rest of them.  I just don't think that's right."
425400,HTHM,2010-01-24 20:25:00,4082,"If you read the original post, I was not bemoaning the fact that I had signed a long term contract. At the time of signing I had every intention of holding on to the phone I have. However in my case the situation has changed, and I need to adjust. I have a phone that I will not need now because I am being supplied one by my new employer, and I was enquiring if anyone knew a way to break the contract at minimal cost. It turns out there is not. So be it. Now the challenge I face is to come up with a solution to the situation that is now at hand. Pay out the contract.....$400.00. Transfer it to someone else, ....they get stuck with a 3 year commitment as opposed to the two years left in my current commitment. Keep useing it and have it added to my expense account,... employer must be willing to do this. Have my daugther/son/wife start using the phone for the balance of the agreement. Change it to a pay as you go, not sure if that works as well. Like yourself I am a long time Bell customer....35+ years"
425570,bassman87,2010-01-25 05:47:00,586,Didn't mean no harm HTHM you sound like a really cool dude. You won't be able to switch it to pay as you go for the remainder of the contract. If your employer wont take over the contract then I'd suggest trying to have someone take it over and have you offer them a phone and maybe some cash as incentive. Try on classified sites such as kijiji or craigslist. goodluck.
425571,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-01-25 05:56:00,0,i will purchase my next phone with cash and never sign a contract again.  i can't switch to rogers however because their coverage in my area is piss poor.
425578,Big Cliff,2010-01-25 09:22:00,6899,"I went through a very similar situation, Sue and I both had cell phones and I was paying Bell about $60.00 a month but we hardly used the phones, they were mostly for emergencies. There were just a couple of months left on our contract when I decided I wanted out of it; $400. early cancelation fee.It was cheaper to just keep the phones to the end of the contract.  As soon as we got out of the contract I called Virgin Mobile, they use the bell network so you get the same service coverage. I bought two phones, from them, $50.00 ea and they gave me back $35.00 worth of service on each of them. On top of that I bought $100.00 worth of air time, good for a year and at the end of the year any un used air time is carried forward. I set it up for automatic top up so I never worry about running out of air time. And instead of paying Bell about $700.00 a year I now pay $200.00.  Dealing with Virgin Mobile has been wonderful, nice friendly English speaking people with a good sense of humor. One of my phones got damaged a while back (actually Sue washed it when she heard me give my phone number to another woman). Walked into Walmart, $48.00 for a brand new Samsung camera phone and 10 minutes on the phone with Virgin Mobile and I was good to go again."

425632,llpp,2010-01-25 15:12:00,30,"We have been owned by bell for quite a few years now,, at first I didn't mind  ,but we have 4 phones with them and i needed a better one for business,i am counting the months to get rid of them, i am waiting on wind to come into the picture ,we pay to much for our cell service in canada,, the more choices we have in canada will hurt the scum that sucked us these past years,they will lose alot of customers,.. the only deal i get is with expresvu, i cancel with them and they offer 30 percent off in a heart beat,if you have them ,, just phone and do the usual cancel routine and say well i think it is to much for the service and you will be offered a deal ,i guaurntee it,, my buddy gets 40 off,  this has been for 2 years now ,free pvr ,hd the whole shebang,, try it ,at least you'.l feel better about this one service while we bend over for there other service.."
424584,HTHM,2010-01-21 21:46:00,4082,"With the new job that I am going to have, I am supplied a blackberry; this makes mine redundant. Is there a way of getting out of the contract? That is relativley painless????"
424586,Governator,2010-01-21 21:48:00,879,When is your contract up?
424587,BillM,2010-01-21 21:48:00,17367,You'll need to pay a cancellation fee depending on how many months you have left in your contract.
424589,The Urban Fisherman,2010-01-21 21:52:00,2050,the only option aside from taking a huge hit is to have the phone and contract signed over to somebody else.... kind of like signing over a car lease to somebody else...
424590,Michael_Brown,2010-01-21 21:53:00,411,"Just offer sexual favours. If that doesn't work, bend over because Bell is going to reach out and touch you for everything possible. Never will I deal with them again for anything. Worst customer servise ever plus all the telemarketing from them sucks.  My Koodoo phones work better, are far cheaper and no contracts.  Another person learning the hard way."
424592,HTHM,2010-01-21 22:09:00,4082,Perhaps my new employer will take it over.....
424599,justin elia,2010-01-21 22:52:00,151,approx. $20 per month left on the contract.  I recently looked into this.
424600,Nemo,2010-01-21 22:56:00,727,20 per month and some bogus processing fee. Then some discussion with the CS reps about why you are cancelling. Just awful
424602,Big Cliff,2010-01-21 23:07:00,6899,"What? You don't like dealing with Bell India?  If I could I would never deal with them again. I tried getting out of a contract that I didn't even agree to. It was going to cost me more to get out of it than to keep it. I ended up keeping it then they tried to tell me I hadn't given them 30 days notice. I took one for the team but they lost a customer for life! Hope that was worth their $30.00.  Good luck, hope you find a way out that doesn't cost you too much.  Actually I got back at them in a way. I found out that you are allowed to have up to 6 receivers on your account at no extra charge so I rented some space from each of my kids and put a Bell receiver in each of their homes/my space. Kids love it, and I get to watch TV when ever I go and stay at my places up North.  We need a one finger smiley face icon on here just for Bell!"
424616,charlied,2010-01-21 23:54:00,584,They also pulled that bull crap with me about the 30 days notice.  Horrible company and service. It has taken me 2.5 years to get rid of their tight leash.....but it will be gone next month!!!  Unfortunately there is no way out of the contract unless you buy it out!!
424618,danc,2010-01-22 00:08:00,4677,"If you have any other services with bell, threaten to cancel them all and they might offer you a sweet deal. There's competition out there and they know it."
424624,BillM,2010-01-22 00:15:00,17367, The next time you call Bell hit #2 or whatever the number is for french...  Then speak english..  Problem solved.
424661,uglyfish,2010-01-22 01:33:00,981,"usually works out to be $20 per month to a maximum of $400, plus whatever fees u have for that months bill. u should prolly start stretching the colon now... just to get ready for it"
424674,shane,2010-01-22 02:15:00,652,You need to speak to the head of the cancellation dept. in the main office. Just ask for Mr. Dover.  First name Ben.
424697,troutologist,2010-01-22 03:25:00,951,"I went through this in the fall, moved to MB from ON and looked into things Bell doesn't have coverage here....  Called Bell and their suggestions were either paying 360 odd dollars or signing my contract over.  Was not happy and asked to speak to the superior, he said we would allow them to charge me a low low fee of 15/mo instead of the full fee.   Only way I got out of it was at the time I signed the contract there was a provision to allow lateral transfer between Bell and MTS with no charges.  3 Months prior to my request to terminate the contract they removed this clause.   I documented this...7 people later, and after some extremely pushy behaviour on my part...2hrs 15min later. I was out for $50 processing fee and had my longdistance charges while using my Bell phone in MB credited.  They upper level people have a great deal of authority to fix these issues.  Lessons learned in dealing with Bell, explain your situation to each person you talk to (its recorded) document names, times and numbers of all the people you talk to.  ""I don't find your resolution acceptable, please let me speak with your superior""   It worked for me....the extreme level of frustration of the call, and the restraint taken to calmly deal with absolute idiots was worth the $300 or more it saved.  Just call and raise hell with those asshats, tell em I sent you."
424701,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-01-22 03:37:00,0,"i had it out with them this spring over disconnecting my phone because of the high LD from pulaski to the sault.  i attempted to explain that i was racking up those bills because i was expecting a baby, and the poorly paid high school dropout i was talking to gave me attitude and said there was nothing she could do.  i did the same, and had the call escalated through the call centre until i spoke to a superior with the authority to over-ride the system.  it was only after i attempted to unsubscribe from every service from call waiting to answering machine to texting to internet before they got scared enough to concede to my demands.  good on ya ham."
424713,basketclam,2010-01-22 04:07:00,115,"Yeah man, good luck.  As with some other posters so far, I've found that you can't get out without paying your way or signing the contract over.  I didn't sign up for a contract, but the person at the Bell World must have ""hit the wrong key"" when they processed my account.  ""We're sorry sir.  You're on a contract and we can't do anything about that now.  You should have paid closer attention to your receipt.""  But wait ... this was a Bell employee who screwed me.  Doesn't that count for something?  Nope - Bell Worlds are franchises, so employees there are not not actually employed by Bell, so to speak.  Took me three years to get rid of that phone because, dammit, I wasn't about to pay a disconnection fee and give them my money for nothing.  Worst customer service I've ever experienced and I'd gladly pay higher fees to any other company rather than deal with Bell again."
424728,anonymous,2010-01-22 05:10:00,58," cheaper... yes. no contracts... yes.  koodoo working way better huh... you realize that koodoo uses bell's network right? kinda silly to say that koodoo on bell is somehow superior to bell on bell don't you think? sure phone models can make a difference, but not noticable to you or I."
424765,fish_fishburn,2010-01-22 13:21:00,1311,Same old story here. I dumped bell last summer after more than 20 yrs. Now I can eat my dinner in peace and quiet without some clown calling me and trying to sell me something.
424791,Governator,2010-01-22 14:46:00,879,"I dumped Bell last January, best thing I ever did.  I was on a 3 year contract paying $120/month for my blackberry unlimited plan (They don't offer that anymore and it was a complete scam).  After the contract was up I switched to a family blackberry plan on Rogers for my wife and I and pay $80/month for the both of us with more options.  I'm now 100% with Rogers with every service from HD Cable, Internet, 2 Phone Lines (home business), 2 cellphones.  I like getting 1 bill / month instead of 4 from different companies.  Makes paying bills a lot easier for me."
424806,gdelongchamp,2010-01-22 16:09:00,199,"I will be dumping Bell as soon as my wife's blackberry contract is expired. I have already dumped one cell phone. I will then switch to eastlink for all services. I guess  my last visit to a bell customer service store in the the New Sudbury Shopping Mall was the straw that broke the camel's back. When I asked the middle aged blonde lady about cancelling the service because it was far too expensive, she blurted out in a very condescending tone that I had to give them  a 30 day notice. Bell has since contacted me a number of times and have reduced my internet rate, added many more free minutes and increased my wife's blackberry download time 5 fold. But it's too little too late.  Where were they the previous ten years?  They again called me a couple days ago offering to reduce my internet charges again if I agreed to sign a contract for the new rate.  I told them I no longer do contracts and to blow it out their asses because they will probably try and penalize me for breaking that contract as well. And they continue to call me. lol   I have been on sympatico for over 10 years with very good service. The last two years however  I have seen a lot of down time. They never admit that their servers are down and then rationalize that it's probably a problem with my computer."
425053,limeyangler,2010-01-23 08:09:00,5204,"WOW....$160A MONTH...FOR A FRIGGIN PHONE!!!  Do you not realise how many minnows that could buy you, then you could go out fishing without a damn phone bleeping at you all the time....just a thought."
425125,rob v,2010-01-23 18:44:00,535,"they're a fine bunch to deal with .. that's for sure.   My daughter who was about 15 or 16 at the time got sucked into one of their plans/contracts in exchange for a ""free"" phone.   It really bothered me at the time ... that they could make some type of binding contract like that with a kid.   Anyways a couple of years later she moved out west as part of her schooling and needed to cancel her contact with bell.   that'll be $200 plus procesing charges etc etc - money she didn't have and as far as she was concerned she had nothing to loose.  then the calls start coming from the collection agency. I took the time to negotiate on her behalf, and explained that all my service was with bell, (phone, internet, tv etc) ... but they didn't give a crap.   I offered to pay them what I figured she owed them - forget about the fees, penalties etc.  No go.  So now they get nothing.  And as soon as I get enough energy to unsubscribe all my service from bell and find another provider I'm gone too.  25 years with those clowns doesn't count for a damn thing.   Some day my daughter may have a problem with her credit account, all because of a company that can't suck enough money out of every last client they deal with.  She'll never be a bell client - that's for sure.  And she'll have phones, tv's and internet her entire life... but they can't see that.  Man I hate companies like that."
425130,scugpg,2010-01-23 19:34:00,1373,Assuming they are with Bell also...try to get your work to take your number over...they'll probably make them sign a new contract but who cares?  Hopefully they can take your new work phone and repurpose it.
425307,nofish4me,2010-01-24 13:36:00,404,"Well, just remember, you were happy at the time of signing the contract. You just probably hadn't considered all the down sides, prior to signing. I know I'm different than most people, but I would not ever sign a 3 year contract to get a 'Free' phone. Nothing is ever 'Free'. I buy my phones outright and have a monthly contract. As far as Bell goes (that's who I'm with) my phone is usually the one everyone uses when away in the bush or out fishing, because it gets service. I, at this point would not ever change, when I pick up my phone I want it to work. I was talking to someone in Ottawa yesterday on my cellphone and he was using his (Rogers), his dropped the call twice. He commented on the ""most reliable"" thingy."
