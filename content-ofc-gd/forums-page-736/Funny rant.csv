Do kids even know what tag, buck buck, hand ball or red rover are any more? You can't play a game of baseball during recess or lunchtime at school. Show up with a bat and it is confiscated and the child suspended. We played pond hockey and schools had outdoor rinks. Even in the 80's I was taking my turn at flooding the rink at night with my neighbours out in Scarberia.  We also had bb guns, slingshots and firecrackers"

Fantastic television in the 60's/70's and to think we had less than 13 channels but we were lucky as we had that many to choose from because in the middle or southern States there were less and in the north there was even fewer to choose from. Boy we had it made! And remember back when car radios were an option, and then FM radio came out wow!"

Istill miss the Flintstones at noon.... Kids now have too many diversions and just too much choice of stuff to do. Jeez, as a kid, a stick was a multi purpose toy...... I can honestly say that my kids have more toys now than my brother and I had our entire lives. We had one cardboard box of toys and we shared with all the kids on the street, we'd pool our toys and play all day until the street lights came on. Now let your kids out like that without direct supervision....."

425659,Cookslav,2010-01-25 16:48:00,1457,"My parents would say go out side, and we did. It didn't matter if it was rain or shine, outdoor time was part of the daily routine, and not just a walk in the park. After breakfast we could watch some cartoons on the weekend till lunch, but then it was outside utill dinner, and back out to play until the streetlights came on ""if"" we were behaving. I had a ball and a stick...and I was happy to play road hockey morning, noon, and night. I played cops and robbers, or cowboys and indians, built tree forts, and chased rabbits.  Now when My Kids are outside it takes all of 30 minutes before they ask to play the Wii or watch her Dora DVD's for the 5 million'th time. I can't help but think about how the times have changed LOL...  I can still remember the big stink about Tapes changing from 8- tracks And the hype about VCR's...our first was a BETA LOL! That turned out to be a waste eh?"
425664,bigugli,2010-01-25 17:02:00,6138,"Back as a boy. TV was for winter time. Too much going on outside in the summer with fishing, swimming. exploring, building forts, catching tadpoles, torturing frogs, etc...... A time when girls played house and boys played........WAR."

Ya know, the brown one that had the cable to the back of the TV and you switched the 3 level dial on the side and ""clicked"" the buttons.

I was quite happy with it too.....most kids had to make thier own!! I got up here, and the old man bought me a mitchell 300 combo for my 14th birthday. I thought it was the greatest thing in the world at that time. We had a 16ft cedar strip, with a 33 1/2 johnson that was the fastest boat on the lake! LOL. You could waterski behind that thing!  I couldn't wait to get up in the morning, just so I could get outside, and my parents had to DRAG me in the house for dinner.  I haven't seen a game of road hockey for years. That's all we did.......we'd even play at night!!  Rain days never kept us in the house.....if anything we had MORE fun in the rain.  Yup, the times have changed, but I still keep things as simple as possible. Most people think I'm nuts  S."

424385,Muskieman,2010-01-21 04:02:00,2472,"E-Mail sent to me by my older brother...  THE  SPOILED UNDER-30 CROWD!!! If  you are 30 or older you will think this is  hilarious!!!! When  I was a kid, adults used to bore me to tears  with their tedious diatribes about how hard  things were. When they were growing up; what  with walking twenty-five miles to school every  morning....  Uphill... Barefoot...  BOTH  ways Yadda, yadda, yadda And  I remember promising myself that when I grew up,  there was no way in hell I was going to  lay  a bunch of crap like that on my kids about  how hard I had it and  how easy they've got it! But  now that . . . I'm over the ripe old age of  thirty, I can't help but look around and notice  the youth of today.  You've got it so  easy!  I mean, compared to my childhood,  you live in a damn Utopia! And  I hate to say it, but you kids today, you don't  know how good you've got it! I  mean, when I was a kid we didn't have the  Internet.  If we wanted to know something,  we had to go to the damn library and look it up  ourselves, in the card  catalogue!! There  was no email!!  We had to actually write  somebody a letter - with a  pen! Then  you had to walk all the way across the street  and put it in the mailbox, and it would take  like a week to get there!  Stamps were 10  cents! Child  Protective Services  didn't care if our parents beat us.  As a  matter of fact, the parents of all my friends  also had permission to kick our ass! Nowhere was  safe!  We used to go play outside for hours without any parents around and all year around. You kids you're going outside for one hour and you're too cold or hot or you're bored. You would rather play video games or watch tv sitting on your ass all day. There  were no MP3' s or Napsters!  If you wanted  to steal music, you had to hitchhike to the damn  record store and shoplift it  yourself! Or  you had to wait around all day to tape it off  the radio, and the DJ would usually talk  over the beginning and screwing it all up!   There were no CD players!  We had tape  decks in our car.  We'd play our favorite  tape and ""eject"" it when finished, and the  tape would come undone..  Cause  - that's how we rolled, dig? We  didn't have fancy crap like Call  Waiting!  If you were on the phone  and somebody else called, they got a busy  signal, that's it! There  weren't any freakin' cell phones either. If you  left the house, you just didn't make a damn call  or receive one. You actually had to be out of  touch with your ""friends"". OH MY GOD !!!   Think of the horror..  And then there's  TEXTING .  yeah  , right.  You  kids have no idea how annoying you are..  And  we didn't have fancy Caller ID either!   When the phone rang, you had no idea who it  was!  It could be your school, your mom,  your boss, your bookie, your drug dealer, a  collections agent, you just didn't know!!!   You had to pick it up and take your  chances, mister!  We  didn't have any fancy Sony Playstation video  games with high-resolution 3-D graphics!   We  had  the Atari  2600!  With games like 'Space Invaders'  and 'Asteroids'.  Your guy was a little  square!  You actually had to use your  imagination!!  And there were no multiple  levels or screens, it was just one screen...  Forever!  And  you could never win.  The game just kept  getting harder and harder and faster and faster  until you died!  Just like  LIFE!  You  had to use a little book called a TV Guide to  find out what was on!  You were screwed  when it came to channel surfing!  You had  to get off your ass and walk over to the TV to  change the channel!  NO  REMOTES!!! There  was no Cartoon  Network either!  You could only get  cartoons on Saturday Morning.   Do you hear what I'm saying?  We had  to wait ALL  WEEK  for cartoons, you spoiled little  rat-buggers!  And  we didn't have microwaves.  If we  wanted to heat something up, we had to use the  stove! And make good popcorn in a pot on the stove! Imagine that! That's  exactly what I'm talking about!  You kids  today have got it too easy.  You're  spoiled.  You guys wouldn't have lasted  five minutes back in 1980  or  before!  Regards, The  Over 30 Crowd   RFS "

Even the sheenyman came by horse & wagon to pick up your junk....for FREE  Us kids were friends with all the drivers and they'd let us ride the horses down the street while they made their rounds. Today if a driver took the kids for a ride in his truck he's prolly get sued  I guess we were the rich folks on the block cause Dad made a whopping $25 a WEEK so we could actually afford a black & white TV........with a huge 6"" screen  As for the new electronic world, I feel like I've been left behind because I don't even know what 1/2 the gadgets are that folks talk about anymore....what the heck is a Napster ??"

I do remember on Sat morning he used to bring a tray of different sweet type buns to the door  Dad wore a suit to work, same job is now more casual, cleaners used to stop and pick up white shirts for laundry and a suit if it needed drycleaning. Man, she was some POed if she forgot to put the card in the window, she'd have to wash and press a shirt  We lived in the country, had to take our own trash to the dump. But that could be a lot of fun, never knew what sort of good stuff you'd find and then on occasion Dad bring a .22 and a box of shells and we have a blast shooting rats"
424546,Jonny,2010-01-21 18:33:00,1380,"Let's haul our asses back to the 60's (which is not all that far back to me   ).  Two channels on TV, both CBC, one of them French. If you wanted to see a movie, you had to stay up for the Late Show. After the Late Show you got the old Indian-head test pattern.  If you wanted to see a new-release movie in Sudbury, you went to the Capitol or Regent theatre. If you wanted a double-bill of second-run movies, you went to the Empire or Plaza theatre. If you wanted third-run or B movies (and some private necking), you went to the Notre Dame drive-in theatre, or the the 69 Drive-In (what a name!) on Hwy 69.  (Later, I got my first VCR in about 1976 and paid $800 for it - figure that out in 2010 dollars! About that same time, the first video game was ""Pong"".  Atari's ""Space Invaders"" and ""Asteroids"" was a big step up.)  If you wanted to get together with friends, you actually planned ahead when you were at school. If it was spur-of-the-moment you phoned them at home. If they weren't home then you went out and tried to find them at the usual haunts.  Man, the more I think about this, the more I think I sound like my grandfather if he were talking about the switch from silent movies to ""talkies"", or my Dad reminiscing about listening to ""Amos and Andy"" on the parlour radio!"

Every kid in our neighborhood had one.  Back in those days for fun we would go for bike rides and look for empty pop bottles in the ditches. Throw them in our carriers on our bikes and when we had enough pedal are butts across town to the corner store. The pop was stored in a cooler full of water. 25 cents worth of return bottles would get you a pop, bag of chips or pink elephant popcorn and a pack of Bazooka Joe bubblegum, with some lame arse cartoon in it to read.  Simpler times for sure. But I wouldn't trade it for anything though."
