Sitting in front of the VDT all day is just wrong. So I spent most of the day in the kitchen Time for some old fashioned goodness. Now my family does consist of picky eaters. That means I have to modify recipes to suit the peanut gallery. They want to smother everything in ketchup part 1, bread.  They don't like molasses so we substitute and make honey oatmeal bread.   For dinner I wanted a treat. The tree huggers can have their soy(lent) and greens   Tonight we were having quail. Slow cooked and stuffed with fresh fruit to sweeten and tenderize the little darlings to mouth watering perfection . Mmmm Mmm!  The sweet gravy was a perfect topping for the baked turnip.  Try not to drool too much on your keyboards folks."

I did bread twice last weekend, using at least 8 to 10 / water to flour by weight. Same bread every week, one of these days I'm going to get it right, but each week is better than the last.  Keep that inspiration coming, with thanks in advance."
