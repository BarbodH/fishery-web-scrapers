424475,Dabluz,2010-01-21 15:10:00,701,"Rubbing the snare on a small tree trunk....really makes a smooth round snare.  So....just put the wire behind a small tree trunk, grab each end of the snare and rub it back and forth.  The snare will take a natural curve that is perfectly smooth....very little friction.  When tying your snare to the branch that is angled over the trail, make 3 turns around the branch and then twist the free end around the wire lead.  The snare must not swing on the branch.  I usually use a branch that is about 1 1/2 inches in diameter and jam the cut end into the ground and then tangle the other end between some trees.  I use a long branch for this.  I try to make my setup under some evergreen trees where there will be less chance of snow filling up the trail and burying the snare.  It's quite a chore setting up a snare because you really have to be in dense brush.  I use a pair of good shears to cut my branches but I always have a sharp hatchet for bigger stuff.  I find that the little upright branch just under the snare bothers the hares....they don't seem to like being scratched on the belly I guess.  I've seen many people do that trick and they do have sucess snaring rabbits but they also have over 100 snares set.  It would take me a week to set 100 snares and would cover a realy big territory.  I prefer setting up a good quality snare on a great looking trail.  Sometime, I will lay a branch crossways under the snare but it must be done so that the rabbit does not have to force his way through the obstacle.  Try to keep the distance between the snare and the upper branch as short as possible.  However, you should have a good 3 inches of clearance between the snare and upper branch.....the same distance as the snare is off the ground.  I was really surprised when I actually saw a rabbit getting caught in one of my snares.  The rabbit was not running....just walking slowly and sniffing around.  When he got to the snare....he just gave a push and his neck was firmly grasped by the wire.  He gave a couple of more pushes and by the time I got to him....he was dead.  Hardly struggled and did not make a sound.  Very impressive....very fast and probably much more humane than people think.  I often have 100% sucess rates with my snares on the first day they are set up.  After that, it quickly drops off to approx 70% the next day and then about 20% on the third day.  After that, it's about 10% sucess unless I remove the snares and there is no additional snow to make the rabbits change the location of their highways.  Big snowfalls, a day of thaw followed by a day of cold will allow the rabbits to run on the crust all over the place but in the real thick bush, the trails stay pretty constant.  I do have a tendancy to make my snares a tad larger than other people.  The smaller rabbits often have a paw in the snare too but I try to target larger hares and anyway, later in the season, the rabbits are older and larger.  I don't have many break offs but they do happen.  Often it's a rabbit who has got one or both paws in the snare....along with his head or a larger stronger animal like a skunk.  Since my snares do collapse when touched...I do catch a lot of squirrels and grouse.  Up here where I live....there are only red squirrels.  The grouse are either spruce grouse or ruffed grouse.....more often they are spruce grouse.  It's a pretty bird but the meat is much darker and stronger tasting.  My wife usually cooks the spruce grouse when making baked beans.  The rabbits are also cooked in baked beans but most often simply baked like a chicken along with a small roast of pork.  Don't forget that the kidneys, heart and liver are great t eat too.  Just remove the bile sack inside the liver before cooking.  My wife cooks my rabbits with the head (fur and ears removed).  There are the rabbit cheeks, the tongue and the brains that are great eating too."
424481,Dabluz,2010-01-21 15:18:00,701,"I never use a snare that has already caught a rabbit.  Been doing that so long now that the reason is obscure but I think it was due to too many of those used snares breaking off.  I've tried the brass snares and even old dull brass snares and I seem to get fewer rabbits with them.  They are also larger (approx .030"" to .040"") but are maybe a bit stronger.  I've tried .017"" locking wire and did catch rabbits but did have more break offs.  The best has been .020"" locking wire.  I'm sure that .022"" or .024"" locking wire would do fine too but .030 locking wire is definately too stiff.  Another great source for wire is monel trolling wire in size .020"".  It's probably exactly the same stuff as locking wire.  Anyway....it seems to me to be the same and that's what I use now.  Maybe I'm too nostalgic when I think of aircraft locking wire.  I remember even putting locking wire on many of the bolts on my motorcycle.  If 2 bolts were close together, I would lock both bolts by twisting locking wire between the too bolt heads.  Looked snazzy too."
424736,waterwolf,2010-01-22 05:53:00,556,"we used the""condo""in areas of high bunny concentration and traffic.send 4 stakes at 4 feet in lenghtth into the snow about 7 feet apart in a square formation. attach small trees connecting the perimeter of  the stakes at about 10 in off the snow.cut small branches of fir trees and attach them to the trees connecting the 4 stakes creating 4 walls ,leaving 3 small holes on each of the 4 sides set your snares at each of these openings . cut the top off a young birch tree with good buds and center it in the condo bunnies love birch buds. 2  to 3 a night was not a uncommon.4 foot stakes allowed you adjust the height of your snares when it snowed."
425051,Dabluz,2010-01-23 06:53:00,701,"Not allowed to use enclosures in my region.  This due to the fact that snaring grouse is not legal.  Those that snare grouse illegally, make a large enclosure with a few snares around de circumference and bait the middle with natural food that grouse like to eat.  Grouse either walk into an enclosure or fly into an enclosure but walk out.  They never fly in and fly out.  I would have a hard time convincing a conservation officer that I was just looking for rabbits.  However, snaring a grouse accidentally in a rabbit snare is legal and it's quite common to snare a grouse."

425620,pikeie,2010-01-25 14:25:00,380,"so ive moved the snares around since last week. i set the new ones up yesterday in some fairly young growth conifers, on some well used trails. i get down here this morning and check the first few. a couple of them fell/ knocked over, so i fixed them up. got to my last set and on the last one i was checking i noticeed i couldnt see my snare, then as i got closer it was tightend way more then i had set it. then i realized.... there was blood and fur everywhere!! and what was all around my snare? coyote tracks! stupid dogs lol... o well at least im getting closer to getting one!  i was amazed that the dogs got to one so quick! i mean it was set yesterday evening!"
424077,pikeie,2010-01-20 02:33:00,380,recently ive become interested in snaring snowshoe hares. i have not set any snares yet but i plan to soon. i was just looking through the regs online and i cant seem to find a limit on the number of snares a person with a valid small game licence can use? does anyone know?  Thanks Matt

424178,pikeie,2010-01-20 14:23:00,380,"Well it's totally legal up here. And where I plan to set them, no one walks there dogs that far back.

424243,shane,2010-01-20 20:56:00,652,"We used to snare rabbits when I was a kid in Manitoba.  We would always hang our snares from above.  Find an active trail where it's entering some bushes.  Hang your snare from an overhead branch right where it narrows down to a tunnel. And I agree with Anders. Your snare looks a bit big. Ideally, the bunny will just get his head through.  If he gets his front legs through he has a good chance of wiggling out. Good luck."

424393,Dabluz,2010-01-21 04:10:00,701,"I do a lot of snaring for snowshoe hares where I live.  Some times, I set up 9 snares and the next day I have 9 rabbits.  I prefer the steel monel snares.....020"".  I make my circle by grabbing each end of the wire and pulling it over a small tree trunk.  The circle is clean and perfect....plus it removes any human scent.  I then set up the size of the circle so my fist just makes it through the cricle.  I have a small fist.....4"".  The circle is a bit smaller because it deforms a bit when my fist goes through it so about 3 1/2 inches is about the best.  I sometimes go to 4 inches later in the winter when the rabbits are larger.  I then make a bend where I want the circle to stop.  Then....I carefully close the circle almost completely and then open it back up to the bend.  This way, when the rabbit touches the wire, it springs closed about 1/2 way or more.  No snare limits or rabbit limits where I live.  We can even sell the rabbits and there are butcher shops that buy them and resell them to customers.....it's legal. I also make fences so that the rabbit is lead into the gap where the snare is.  I don't put a small post under the snare.  I just make sure that it is low enough to the ground....about 4 fingers (3 inches) off the ground.  I like to put some wide evergreen branches over the snare to remove any possible glare that the moon could reflect on the snare wire.  In any event, the rabbits like to sit under branches.  I have seen rabbits come up to a snare....get caught and before I could get to them, they died due to blood not getting to the brain.  They did it in complete silence.  They will struggle and scream if they get a front leg or half their body into the snare.  If possible....do not walk in the rabbit trail.  If you do, make sure that the rabbit can continue to use the trail.  I leave my snare wire outdoors for a good while (to make them as dull as possible).  The best snare wire is aircraft locking wire .020"".  I wish I could get more somewhere.  I wish I had scarfed more when I was in the airforce.  To make the tiny locking loop at the end of the wire, I use a small nail and I make the turns so that both the turning wire and the main wire twist at the same time.  This is the strongest loop and this is how the twists are made when using this wire on aircraft bolt heads and electrical fasteners.  The tiny loop is 90 degrees to the circle of the snare....you want the least amount of friction possible.  The small loop will prevent the snare from loosening after it is closed around the neck of the rabbit.  I'm not much for putting out hundreds of snares like a lot of people I know.  I look for main trails where the rabbit trails converge.  If I can install 12 snares in a day....I'm happy because I know that I will have rabbits in most of my snares.  Rabbits make a lot of tracks so it doesn't take long for the snares to come up empty.  When I have too many empty snares....I remove them, restaure the trail like it was and place the snare elsewhere.  I now use my GPS to mark my snares because there are a lot of guys who spend their time just looking out for marking ribbons and then steal the rabbits.  For snaring....the colder the better.  Wind keeps the rabbits immobile unless the snares are in really dense cover.  Every once in a while, the rabbits love to move out into open spaces and run around in groups......usually on nights with full moon, no wind and cold.  Snaring success goes a bit down during these evenings because the rabbits run everywhere.  I guess the full moon also makes the snares more visible.  There are no snare limits or rabbit limits in my region.  It's even legal to sell the rabbits.  Many butcher shops buy them and resell them to customers.  This does not affect the rabbit population.  However, there are regula variations in rabbit populations...it's usually a 6 to 10 year variation from many to few rabbits."
424408,Sinker,2010-01-21 07:20:00,8692,"Dabluz knows his stuff!!  I grew up snaring rabbits too. Everything he wrote there is bang on, you can pretty much follow that to a T. I like to suspend them from the top too. I've seen rabbits push a snare to the side of the trail to avoid it, but when its hanging from above, you seem to have more success. A cold, clear, windless night is the best. Look for a natural funnel to set the snare in, too much altering thier trail and they will go around it, jump over it, or stop using the trail all together. Try not to step on thier path at all if possible. The trick about pulling the wire around a branch to make it round and remove scent is the way to do it. Check them EVERY day, and make sure you know EXACTLY how many you have out, and EXACTLY where you put them. Make sure the snare is fastened to something solid. Those snowshoes will tear the place up, and drag a branch a long ways. The one in your set could be missing in the morning.   The guy who is snaring rabbits in Windsor should be reported to the MNR. I would even get the cops involved in a case like that. If my dog got caught in a poachers snare, rest assured, I""d be waiting there until he came to retreive his rabbits with the cops or a CO. Take pics of his sets, or even wait and get his plate #. Rabbit #'s are low enough in southern ontario, we don't need some poacher taking them illegally!!!  I wish I could snare them around here!!!  I'd really like to see your results. Its kinda like snaring rabbits vicariously through you  S."

Although i did have a set of tracks go AROUND one of my snares lol. so i beefed them up alot, with piles of spruce, and balsam fir. i also made the snares smaller less then 4 inches now probably 3.5 inches.  Thanks for all that info Dabluz! it is really appreicated! i never would of thought to make the loop on a tree, such a good idea! im going to go set 5 more tomarrow sometime and if i have any luck ill be sure to post the results!"
