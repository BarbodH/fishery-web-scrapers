425891,holdfast,2010-01-26 03:59:00,1813,Yea btween the storms I had a few hours of Ice Fishing on Cowan.  I wanted to try a walk in lake but with all this snow I figured Id stay close than risk getting stuck some where.  I had a couple of nibbles and stolen minnows which I figure must of been something else than Pike.  Anyways I decided to make my very first movies.  Heres my attempt with Spike playing Hockey and soccer.  Check out how energetic the little guy is.  what a hoot.  Hockey      Soccer        Ice fishing
