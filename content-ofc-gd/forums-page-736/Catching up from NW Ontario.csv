424849,trapshooter,2010-01-22 19:12:00,1234,"I thought I'd share some pics from a few recent ice fishing trips.  Action on the lake trout has been good, but no real big ones yet.  All have been in the 2-5lb range.  I plan to put a lot more effort into trout this year in hopes of catching a 'big' one.      My buddy Rob.        We even did up a fresh lake trout shorelunch one day on the ice.  Here's a pic of me frying fish with 2 pieces of kindling.    Walleye have been hitting well too.  Here's a couple pictures of some of the nicer fish so far this year.    My buddy Colin with a nice 26""er    I hit this pike the other day, which was a lot of fun on the walleye gear.    We came across this wolf kill on the ice on Lac Seul.  Pretty cool.    Cheers everyone, and good fishing.  ben"
424868,troutologist,2010-01-22 19:41:00,951,"Right on Ben, some nice fish there for sure. Cool pics   I like that on ice fire set up and the Lac Seul chopsticks."
424877,Jds63,2010-01-22 20:04:00,1365,Great report and pics Ben .... looks like the white tubes were working .... and those walleye are beauties  is the ice 45 helping out locating the fish ? I have been field testing mine and am certainly impressed so far ....
424883,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-01-22 20:16:00,0,i'm loving that ice 45.
424901,FisherMike,2010-01-22 20:39:00,108,nice work ben!!!  i cant wait to get back up there.
424906,trapshooter,2010-01-22 20:47:00,1234,This is season #2 for me with the Humminbird flasher.  Still works like a charm.  It marks my swivel in 80' of water... what more can I ask for.  Hey MO - not long now and you will be back up here.  The real bugger will be waiting for our 2nd annual muskies and mustaches trip in Sept.
424911,FisherMike,2010-01-22 20:53:00,108,"haha!!  yep, soon enough.  ive got muskies on my mind still.  managed to find a manta on ebay the other day.  also im thinking of a mid-summer musky moustache bonanza for a day or two.  what do you think??  say hey to robby for me."
424912,trapshooter,2010-01-22 20:59:00,1234,"Yeah, fished with rob 3 days this winter already.  Good times.  I'm always up for muskie fishing... you know that.  Just a matter of finding 2 or3 days that we're all off."
424962,Ron,2010-01-22 23:26:00,1683,"Pretty kewl Rob.  I gotta say though, that 45 gal drum musta been tough to haul in for a shore lunch!"
425020,terry71,2010-01-23 02:48:00,21,"Nice catch of fish. Hopefully the 45 gal drum comes off the ice before spring. Don't know what's cool about seeing a dead animal though. Just my thoughts. Again, nice fish dude."
425023,scuro2,2010-01-23 02:58:00,904,Nicely shot pictures...a pleasure to look see fish on ice.
425062,solopaddler,2010-01-23 12:50:00,8605,Nice to see an update Ben. Looks as though you're enjoying winter. (Man I wish I could hop on a plane and join you for a couple days.)
425064,JohnAB,2010-01-23 13:29:00,178,Ben which lake you catching the lakers on? Big Vermilion?
425067,Paully,2010-01-23 14:04:00,712,Nothing better than fresh lakers for lunch! wtg.
425084,Spiel,2010-01-23 15:04:00,9065,I'll take a mess a lakers that size anytime and the walleye aren't bad either.  Oh and I'd say that looks more like an 18.5 gallon drum.
425086,trapshooter,2010-01-23 15:17:00,1234,"Thanks guys.  Some are Big V trout, John.  I also fished a couple lakes closer to dryden."
425103,johnnyb,2010-01-23 16:45:00,3413,Great stuff Ben...thanks for posting it up!
425525,trapshooter,2010-01-25 02:54:00,1234,"Don't worry, the fire barrel comes off the ice every trip."
425531,foggynotions,2010-01-25 03:09:00,21,Great post and great pictures!!!
