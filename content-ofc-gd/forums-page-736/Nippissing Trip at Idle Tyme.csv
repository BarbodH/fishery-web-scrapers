Arrival for the first couple guys was at 3:30pm on thursday, the remaining three came later that evening.  We were heartily greeted by Terra and Shawn, new owners and operators of Idle Tyme, given a quick tour of the upper level accomodations in their house.  Lots of room would be an understatement with all the amenities available to make it an enjoyable stay.  Both friday and saturday were early starts, up at 5:30am with a hearty breakfast and then off to the huts where Shawn had already cleared the holes and fired up the wood stoves.  Within 5 minutes of the first minnow down, wham..jumbo perch!  This is good..pretty much non stop action with a bit of a lull around lunchtime, then by 1:30, it picked up again.  The first day garnered a herring a couple of keeper walleye, one slot size, and about 60+ honest keeper perch. We probably released 3 to 4 times that many. The second day was almost a replica of the first.  I came back a bit early each day to get the supper going for 6, Ragout for the first and a real Tourtiere du Lac St Jean for last night.  We had hoped for a few more hours in the huts this morning, but, two long days in the fresh air took their toll, we had a departing breakfast, packed and hit the road back home.  Without a doubt, we'll be booking another trip to Idle Tyme. I'm sure 12footsprinkbok will add a few pics he took.   "
