Fishing was very tough, but Kelli and I managed to put a few on the ice.  She kicked our butts today and put 4 decent lakers on the ice.  I managed 3.  All fish taken on a homemade jig, man that feels nice!  Brought one little stocker home for the pan, the rest are still swimmin.  Tight lines!          Here's some more action from the 2010 season to date.  I'm getting some charters booked up now, which is nice.   14 incher from Innisfil   This was on 2 inches of ice, didnt want to post and give people the wrong impression about conditions, safety first.   A good friend and client with a beauty laker on one of my new jigs!   Nice evening after work 5/6"
425483,TDunn,2010-01-25 01:02:00,680,Nice Steve as usual My sister is attending college in Orilla and I hope to get down there this winter to try Simcoe out for my first time.... and visit with her...LOL Looking forward to your reports throughout the winter man   TDunn

425496,steverowbotham,2010-01-25 01:23:00,1800," Not any of those ones. It's a totally different jig, made specifically for laker jigging. I havent quite ""perfected"" this one yet.  You'll see it soon enough."
425512,redneck666,2010-01-25 02:14:00,563,those lakers are beauty's! great job!  JP
425796,steverowbotham,2010-01-25 22:53:00,1800,"  I've had a bunch of PM's on other boards about these jigs, so here's what I'll do.  I've been selling them to guys on the ice @ 2 for $5.  I'll do the same here on OFC.  They are fairly unique to ice fishing, and are extremely effective, but fairly easily replicated.  I dont want to post photos online and have the ""secret"" get out.  I will sell them @ $3 each or 2 for $5 to OFNers.  I have ""higher quality"" ones that I've been doing for $4 each.  Anyone interested has already received a PM.  If you havent, please email me @ [emailÂ protected]  I'm not here to SPAM or take advantage and I dont want to put that vibe out, I'm only doing this because of a decent demand that I have received. Enjoy and tight lines!"

425896,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-01-26 04:13:00,0,no pm for me steve.  could you show us a pic of these babies?
425901,splashhopper,2010-01-26 04:29:00,2931,dayuuummmm... this newbie ice fisher just might have to make a trip up to simcoe.... thanks for the report
425914,Cudz,2010-01-26 06:36:00,2652,LOL.  It was a tough day Steve.  We followed you and Ryan almost everytime you moved (until you guys walked almost all the way to BBP!!!)  I had to be home by 12:30.  You might have started on the North shore but you finished nearer to the south shore.  Got to hand it to Kelli though as she seemed willing to do the walk.  She also got up pretty darn early to be at the park before 7am (no way my wife would ever think of doing that) I saw the one pic of the laker and it was taken fairly late in the morning.  I did not feel too bad about my day as I know you guys know what you are doing and you guys were having a tough time out there.  I managed a total of 2 perch.  I guess I should have introduced myself but you guys were just leaving the parking lot to go out onto the ice when we were getting our stuff ready in the parking lot.
425919,steverowbotham,2010-01-26 10:11:00,1800,"  Thought I recognized you at the parking lot, wasnt 100%.  We did walk a lot, got to stay away from the crowds!"
