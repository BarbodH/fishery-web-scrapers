With really early mornings, full days on the ice and so much to do prepping gear for the next day let alone trying to spend a little time with your family, posting up pictures and reports has been difficult to find the time for.   It was nice to bring my 4 year old daughter out on Saturday afternoon for a couple of hours mid-day.  She was a good little helper for our “on-ice fish fry”.  The fishing has been interesting with some days being better than others, but walleyes are being caught every day.  We can't expect to haul them up in great numbers every day of the week.  Just getting a decent amount of fish every day and even better results frequently is nothing that we can complain about.  Lately we have been staying in areas that have little current to keep lots of ice under everyone's feet.  I hope to get a lot more pictures off of Ryan's camera soon and will try to get a few of them posted up soon.  I know there are some beauties on his memory card.  Be safe and good fishing!  Jeff              My fishing hot spot...  :wink: Lots of ice here!                   "

425630,ehg,2010-01-25 15:03:00,2666,Very nice pile of big walleye. Not really into ice fishing but hammering those big fish down in Quinte is the best. Have to go down the 401 and try it again soon. Thanks for pics
425695,LeXXington,2010-01-25 19:00:00,1928,"Very nice pics,"
425708,bubbles,2010-01-25 19:47:00,591,Why don't more people ice fish on Quinte?  I am obviously not familiar with the area.
425881,Joeytier,2010-01-26 03:20:00,3990,Have you BEEN there in the winter?
425951,bubbles,2010-01-26 13:21:00,591,"Nope, that is why I asked.  You don't hear about it like Simcoe and Nipissing."
