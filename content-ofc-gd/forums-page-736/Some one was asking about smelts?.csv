425876,bigugli,2010-01-26 02:56:00,6138,"After doing the shoulder to shoulder thing It is a lot nicer jigging for them. No bumping, jostling or fists. No CROWD. It's a real hoot getting them to the bucket before they can wriggle off the hook."
425911,Dabluz,2010-01-26 05:18:00,701," When fishing for smelt through the ice, they are usually caught in about 3 to 10 feet of water.  Rig up a light but fast action short ice rod with 4 lb mono.  Make a series of dropper loop knots about 3 to 4 inches apart and attach a size 10 hook to each loop.  Use a tiny bit of nightcrawler on each hook.  Put a 1/4 once bell sinker on the end of the line and lower the line to the bottom.  Where I fish, there is no limit to the number of hooks.  I use 10 hooks so that I can pull the whole setup out of the water with my short rod.  When the smelt are biting, it's quite common to catch 3 or 4 at a time.  However, in Quebec, the limit is 120 smelt which is quite a bit since you need a really big appetite to eat more than 20 of them.  On top of that, their importance as a forage fish for sport fish is still underated.  You won't find landlocked salmon unless there are smelt.  I can manage to eat about 30 of them....however with nothing else on the plate.  I prefer small smelt because you can eat them like french fries...no need to remove the vertebrae.  The real tiny smelt (about 3 inches), I freeze individually and use for bait.  The are excellent eating when fresh.  Some people freeze them to eat another day but I find that they lose their taste after only a short while in the freezer.  I only eat them fresh (less than 24 hours).  Fresh smelt smell quite a bit like cucumber....very similar to whitefish.  I often go smelt fishing through the ice so I have a few people (usually older folk who no longer can go fishing) who I give them to.  I usually quit when I have around 100 smelt caught.  That means that I have a good 1 hour of work at the sink.  Smelt are an interesting fish.  Most die after spawing but some do spawn again and even a third time.  They are a relative to Atlantic salmon...so are whitefish and grayling.  Smelt also have a natural antifreeze in their blood.  Here in the Saguenay river where salt water mixes with fresh water, the water can actually be -2 or -3 celsius near the ice.  This means that an ordinary fish would freeze at that temperature....but not smelt.  However, the smelt further north have a greater concentration of this antifreeze.  Where I fish, there are 20 foot tides.  This means that at low tide, there is no water under the fishing hut.  However, as soon as there is 6 inches of water, the smelt start moving under the ice.  It also means that I only fish on a rising or falling tide.  Rising tide seems to be the best time.  The smelt aren't always moving under the fishing hut.  They sometimes run elsewhere so sucess is not a sure thing however, if you find a fishing spot where you can usually catch smelt, you have a silver mine.  Smelt are not the only fish with an antifreeze in their blood but they are numerous and are of commercial importance.  They may even be a way of using this antifreeze to cure cancer.  Imagine being able to use this antifreeze in normal human tissue and be able to freeze (and therefore kill) nearby unhealthy or cancerous human tissue."
426029,Jonny,2010-01-26 18:07:00,1380," Sounds like fun to try.  Where I fish for smelt, however, is a tiny creek just 200 ft. from my house and I usually have it all to myself. I check it on nights when I think the smelt might run, and when I get a good run I might get half a dozen per scoop with the net. To smelt fishermen who hope for nets almost too heavy to lift out of the water, that probably sounds ridiculous. But if I spend half an hour at the creek, I can get more smelts than I care to clean.  --  Thanks for the excellent detail, Dabluz. It would be worth trying around here to see if there are any results. If I ever get to it, I'll have a copy of your post to refer to."
425528,bigugli,2010-01-25 03:02:00,6138,"Despite the rain we tested one of the ice holes. Results were a little disappointing.  We found 4"" of ice before the rain started, but the ice was deteriorating quickly with the heavy rains. By tomorrow evening it would not be safe. Smellts are a lot smaller this year compared to last. Even so, managed enough to give the fryer a workout.   We will need cold weather before that ice is again good to go."

425537,bigugli,2010-01-25 03:15:00,6138," Small micro tear drops; plain, tipped with maggots, waxies, eyeballs, red and pink yarns. Depending on the day, they range bottom to just below the hole.  Today the bottom was where the bite was."
425540,Leecher,2010-01-25 03:19:00,7832," Nice Bruce Question: I'm sure this one was asked before, but how do you cook those??  Do you cook'em hole or clean them??  Never fished for this species.   Oh and one more question: what's the limit on those?? Jacques"
425550,bigugli,2010-01-25 03:45:00,6138,"Head removed and gutted rolled in a dry mix or batter. 30 seconds to cook in hot oil. Now if you were getting the big coastal smelts from the maritimes, about a minute to cook.  No limit on smelts and can be netted in springtime."

425557,crappieperchhunter,2010-01-25 04:21:00,2582,A sink o smelts...thats what I like to see   The ones you put me on last year where the best I ever tasted.  Hopefully the cold that is coming will firm up the ice cause I'm dying for a road trip and a feed.

425560,bigugli,2010-01-25 04:28:00,6138,"I hear you Steve. Today was just a teaser, but while I was there the holes were getting wider and wider and the ice softer and softer. Besides i need a few days to get the kitchen ready"
425564,pike slayer,2010-01-25 05:03:00,1177,when times get tough eat your bait!
425565,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-01-25 05:06:00,0,smelt are delicious.  i used to net them here but i got sick of cleaning them.  you haven't lived until you've cleaned smelt for 3 hours... these days i grab a few dozen from others who go and have a feast once a year.
425569,Ron,2010-01-25 05:46:00,1683,   And we will take my truck.

425582,dave524,2010-01-25 10:10:00,4508,"They're cannibals, we used to tip our small hooks and tiny jigging spoons with a small piece of an already caught smelt, the eyes worked especially well  I've also smoked them, remove the rack from your smoker, thread them on cheap chrome skewers for shish kabobs by the tails and rig up something to hold the skewers horizontally in the smoker.  If there is lots of them, there is no better place to take young kids. You'll never wet a line yourself, too busy taking them off the hook and baiting."
425592,bigugli,2010-01-25 12:38:00,6138,"Got to admit smelting is like being a kid in a candy store.  The netting season runs late March to May, not sure of the exact dates."
425610,Thrasher,2010-01-25 14:01:00,39,"Netting them is a blast!!! do it every year! They run at different times depending on temperature. Last year was the best run I've ever seen. Usually when the in flowing creeks reach 8 deg, start checking around for sign. Catch them lots on the ice, usually accidentally on spreaders, but the odd one on jigging spoons etc while looking for whities and lakers."
425697,ScugogBoy,2010-01-25 19:19:00,36,"bigugli.....is it possible to mention the Lake you were on?........was it Simcoe/Erie/Lake O?.......all are big areas and just would like a heads up, as they truly are delicious and plentifull.....thanks for any hints."

425707,Dara,2010-01-25 19:46:00,3052,I can't stand the smell of them other than one feed in the spring time. I caught one in the winter once and couldn't stand to eat any that spring.
425716,bigugli,2010-01-25 20:08:00,6138,I remember the spring runs along the Huron shore and the St Mary's.  Every available Holsteiner from Sudbury to the Sault would be on crowd control along the shoreline. Used to be some narsty brawls over who got what stretch of shoreline.
425818,Jonny,2010-01-26 00:04:00,1380,"Sharp pair of scissors, snip off the head, snip the belly, strip the entrails, rinse and bag. I've found that the fastest way to clean the tasty little buggers.  Dredge in flour, fry crispy brown, grab by the tail and eat. Can't see how anybody that likes fish wouldn't like 'em.  This is the first I've ever heard of anyone catching them with hook-and-line though!   We net them in the spring and that pretty much satisfies the craving for a year."
425840,Hawg Hunter,2010-01-26 01:36:00,204,"l sure miss heading over to the big lake at 11pm and dropping a net in for those smelt i always deep fried mine in fish crisp FANTASTIC,if ya want some company some day let me know... lol  Hawg Hunter"
