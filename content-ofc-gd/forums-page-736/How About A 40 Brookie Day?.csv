425342,Sinker,2010-01-24 15:34:00,8692,"I think the Doc screwed up when he said he only kept deep hooked fish. Looks to me like it worked out to a perfect limit!! Nothing wrong with that, if ya wanna keep a limit, by all means have atter!! I'm a meat hunter too, and proud of it!!! If I can get my limit on my weekly fishing trips, I keep it, and take it home and eat them with my family!!!!! I'd rather catch my own fish for our weekly fish fry, than buy some crap that's been thrown around, and handled all to hell. At least I know what I'm getting.  S."
425358,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-01-24 16:44:00,0,"exactly what sinker said. i should have worded my original post better.  i fully intended to take home a meal of fish. but  instead of throwing the first five fish i caught on the ice (i would have been going home within 20 minutes of being on the lake), i only kept fish that did in fact either ingest or seriously injure themselves with the hook.  this allowed me to not only take home a limit but to fish for an entire day.  keep in mind, the pic shows 20 fish, and we caught twice that."
425372,Kinger,2010-01-24 18:31:00,351,Sweet.  Nice man. Boy am I glad I have no boots...
425382,Dara,2010-01-24 19:22:00,3052,  I get some small ones.    the guys with smaller hooks and line don't outfish me
425384,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-01-24 19:27:00,0,"a 1/0 hook is the size of the head of some of the fish we caught yesterday.   those are big splake, not tiny specks in a lake the size of the essar centre.   nice splake though."
425386,Dara,2010-01-24 19:30:00,3052,"If I was having trouble with getting the smaller ones I would likely move to a smaller hook and light leader...but generally I do ok with the heavy stuff, even on small specs.  I'm not saying you sholdn't use the small hooks...my buddy uses tiny trebles...fine with me."
425399,Fishing 24/7,2010-01-24 20:25:00,709,darn SON your owning them square tails.   good eat'N
425411,pike slayer,2010-01-24 21:06:00,1177,"right on dr. sal! i love days like that even if they arent monsters. so much fun keeping busy! no problems here with you keeping your limit, its just apart of fishing to keep fish and tough beans if yous disagree!"
425436,pikeie,2010-01-24 22:15:00,380,Good job Dr! i really need to hit up the park sometime this winter! let me know if u ever have room!
425467,archie_james_c,2010-01-24 23:42:00,618,Once again Sal owns the backwoods   .  I only wish I could catch specks half as good as you guys  EDIT- Looks like the video shows a couple BRIGHT coloured guys niiice
425469,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-01-24 23:48:00,0,"the one lake we fished, the males were still in bright red spawning colours, and the females were a dynamic purplish silver. maybe the best lookin' specs i've seen in any lake..."
425719,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-01-25 20:09:00,0,PICS AND VIDEO ADDED!  CHECK IT OUT!
425228,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-01-24 02:39:00,0,"My 3 comrades and I departed from Sault Ste. Marie at approximately 4:30 this morning.  At 6:45 we left the car on snowshoe in hopes of doing most of the 1.5 hour hike in the dark.  By 8:30 we we had our first lines set, waiting for a big brookie.  Problem is, he never came! This particular lake has a history of nice chunky fish and several tales of straightened hooks and snapped lines...  unfortunately, today was not the day for this lake.  At about 10:30 we packed up our gear and headed for a nearby lake we've done well on before...  and do well again we would!  Within minutes we had caught a fish, and by 1 we had caught approximately 25 specks.   While we were enjoying the frantic pace, we weren't putting anything huge on the ice.  A half day and all we had were some fish between .5-1.5lb  At 1:30 we arrived at our 3rd lake of the day.  While I had never fished it, a family member had pulled several trophy specks out of it last winter!  Apparently he must have kept them all because we couldn't buy a fish in this lake.  So by 2:30 we were rushing to a lake on the route out. In the hour and a half we fished this lake we caught another 10-15 specks in a flurry of excitement as the sun began to get low, inlcluding some nicer 2lb fish.  All in all, we caught somewhere between 35 and 40 fish, myself accounting for 11 of that tally.  It was a fantastic day for the Doctor.     http://www.vimeo.com/8976104"
425231,Greencoachdog,2010-01-24 02:45:00,8163,I'm looking forward to the 35-40 pics!!!
425233,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-01-24 02:51:00,0,here's a teaser.  we kept anything that was hooked deep or in the gills. http://vimeo.com/8940149
425238,Greencoachdog,2010-01-24 03:01:00,8163,"  Too bad I'm not up there, I could teach you to avoid deep and gill hooking... circle hooks are your friends!"
425239,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-01-24 03:07:00,0,i require snelled bait hooks... very small snelled bait hooks.
425243,Sinker,2010-01-24 03:30:00,8692,Nice limit!! They're gonna fry up real nice!!!! MMMMMMMMM  S.
425244,Greencoachdog,2010-01-24 03:30:00,8163,"  I required the same.. back when I was backward and ignorant!  ...and targeting ""baby fish""!  If I could predict the future, I'd say your next step up is to target Wild Golden Shiners!!!... you can barely get them in on 1/2 lb. test yanno!"
425246,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-01-24 03:34:00,0,is it 17 days since you caught a fish?
425247,trevy727,2010-01-24 03:37:00,351,"did you know that there's a lake in algonquin park called ""Salvelinus lake""? it's got your name on it.  i just looked it up: Salvelinus is a genus of salmonid fish often called char or charr"
425248,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-01-24 03:38:00,0,  totally brah!  and they named a genus of fish after me!
425249,trevy727,2010-01-24 03:42:00,351,"i caught the brookie in my picture up your way (5.9lbs-26""). i fish a lake in the park every spring about 2 hrs passed the soo."
425252,trevy727,2010-01-24 03:46:00,351,spring   
425256,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-01-24 03:52:00,0,nice fish.  i'd be willing to wager which lake.
425257,Leecher,2010-01-24 03:52:00,7832,Sounds like fun Dr Looking forward to seeing the pics and video!!!  Congrats Leechman
425258,Greencoachdog,2010-01-24 03:55:00,8163,  OMG!!!... I'm being stalked!!!
425261,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-01-24 04:00:00,0,  you wish elton!  you said it in the thread above this one!   LOL!
425265,danc,2010-01-24 04:14:00,4677,"Nice report, as usual Doc. Thanks."
425270,Dara,2010-01-24 05:01:00,3052,Nice catch. I myself use quite large snelled bait hooks.
425274,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-01-24 05:24:00,0,"i use #4 and #6 sized hooks, depending upon where i'm fishing."
425276,Dara,2010-01-24 05:30:00,3052,I think 1's and 1-0...fairly large..I don't miss many fish.
425278,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-01-24 05:37:00,0,i'm sure a tiny speck has no problem get a 1/0 hook in his yap...
425293,Sinker,2010-01-24 12:24:00,8692," You don't miss them because they don't bite!! Think of how many trout look at your 20lb mono, and 1/0 hook and just laugh  That set up must really ""anchor"" your bait down there!! I'm sure you get the odd stupid one once in a while though      S."
425314,gbaysteel,2010-01-24 13:56:00,13,If those little specs are taking your small set ups so deep than bigger baits are in order. Target larger fish and give those dinks a chance. When you do locate feeding  fish change to a jig so the small fish have a better chance of survival.  Lindy guppies tipped with or without bait  are deadly for large splake and brook trout. Light lines and small hooks are great fun but fish responsaby get rid of them if the mortality rate is high and sacrifice a few fish caught to ensure the survival of those little guys.
425321,solopaddler,2010-01-24 14:09:00,8605,"Well done, sounds like a fantastic day! Good on you as well Trevor, seems I sold my gear to a kindred spirit. "
425341,trapshooter,2010-01-24 15:28:00,1234,Good fishin' Dr.  Must have been a blast with lines going off all over the place.
