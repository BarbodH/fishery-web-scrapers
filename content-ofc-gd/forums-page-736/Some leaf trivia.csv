425588,muskymatt,2010-01-25 12:26:00,2608,Bottom 3 teams in the league are 1) Edmonton  2) Carolina  3) Toronto  What do their coaches have in common?  Pat Quinn Paul Maurice Ron Wilson  All leaf coaches  Coincidence?????
425607,jediangler,2010-01-25 13:47:00,1923,"In the history of the maple leafs only one coach has ever won the Jack Adams trophy for coach of the year. That was Pat Burns in 1993. The maple leafs have NEVER had a Norris Trophy winner for best defenceman. The last maple leafs Vezina Trophy winner for best goalie was in 1965 Bower/Sawchuk.  Coaching, defence and goaltending. These are the things championships are built on."

425614,Headhunter,2010-01-25 14:19:00,5703,"Well Lew, I was 5 years old when they last won the cup and no, I can't remember it at all! It's pretty sad actually. HH"
425618,Roy,2010-01-25 14:21:00,13728,"We both did, Lew. Just consider it one of those moments neither one of us will ever get back. Ever."

Every Saturday night with that familiar Imperial Oil/ Esso guy as the majour sponsor. On Wednesdays the game was usually in the second period by the time the network switched to it, 9 PM. if I remember right, of course it was B&W."

425687,lew,2010-01-25 18:30:00,12766," Don't feel left out, the Leafs have been negative since '67 too"
