425351,GeorgeJ,2010-01-24 15:59:00,207," As I am only familiar with Chrysler products I can only speak of how their key works, they have actually moved the accessory position from the past locked position (where your steering wheel would become locked) to before. So from the run position you go to the accessory position then to lock which you can only do if you are in park. So all windows, door locks etc. would stay functional. In a stuck throttle position I would think on any car you should be able to turn the key off run and still maintain control of the car although the steering and brakes would be affected."
425429,SBCregal,2010-01-24 21:58:00,688,"The pushbutton starter cars DO have a way to turn on only the accessories and they DO have ways to shut them off while driving.  Some of them you push the start button 3 times some you push and hold them.  Why wouldn't anybody who bought a car like this look into it before operating the car.  First thing I'd do if i couldn't figure it out was RTM, there's lot's of good information in there  ryan"
425477,CLofchik,2010-01-25 00:33:00,854," LOL, it's 2010, there are no keys! The family that died in California was in a rental Lexus that had a push button start, drive by wire throttle and fuzzy logic computerized transmission.  There are ways to turn off the new in vogue push button ignitions, but they are all a universally different sequence then the shutdown used when parking and not exactly intuitive in alot of cases.  Hold the brake and push the button three times in 1 sec or hold brake and hold the button down for 3 sec, AAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHGGGGG.  As a pilot you should be aware of some of the problems that can crop up when engineers try to designs machines smarter than the operators."

If your vehicle is on the recall list.. this is a safety recall.. not a mfg recall. Your vehicle is considered unfit to be on the road if you can't prove compliance.

I'm not a 'Toyota hater' as you call it, but I understand that no manufacturer is perfect. If you check the database, you'll see the Toyota Tundra has had seven safety recalls since 2000.

We all remember when there was a series of unfortunate accidents where many innocent people died one case where a man and his family were going down the interstate when this happened,they had called for help and then the phone went dead ...all were killed. Upon Toyotas own investigation they ""concluded"" that the supposed ""oversized"" mats were the root cause. Prompting a mat recall/replacement.....case closed....NOT Then it was determined that on a couple of these cases the owners in fact had no mats in thier vehicle....one being a Lexus...This man survived thanks to the road ending and he ran into a field...upon a further investigation promted by the owners testimony it was determined that it was a sticking accelerator. This prompts another safety recall to replace the assembly....case closed..NOT It has been stated on a couple of the accident reports by the victims that the pedal in fact took itself to the floor almost like a cruise control kicking in... is this case closed , I think not. This will continue until Toyota recalls and replaces all defective ECM's . This will be a last resort as this will cripple Toyota..... With the ammount of accidents caused by this defect, % wise corporate bean counters determine that it will be cheaper for them to pay out lawsuits rather than issue a total recall.  This is not the last we will hear of this. I,m sure of it."

424894,craigdritchie,2010-01-22 20:27:00,1586,"Toyota Recalling Vehicles in Canada and U.S. To Fix Sticking Gas Pedals  By Dan Strumpf And Stephen Manning, The Associated Press  NEW YORK - Toyota said Thursday it is recalling more than 2.3 million vehicles in the U.S. and Canada to fix accelerator pedals that can become stuck, the latest in a string of quality problems that have bedeviled the Japanese automaker.  The recall affects the 2009-2010 RAV4, the 2009-2010 Corolla, the 2009-2010 Matrix, the 2005-2010 Avalon, the 2007-2010 Camry, the 2010 Highlander, the 2007-2010 Tundra and the 2008-2010 Sequoia.  The Avalon, Camry and Tundra models - encompassing about 1.7 million vehicles - also were included in the 4.2 million-vehicle recall Toyota launched in late 2009 in the United States over concerns that accelerator pedals could become lodged under floor mats, causing sudden acceleration. That problem was blamed for several crashes, including an accident involving a Lexus that accelerated to more than 190 kilometres per hour before crashing in San Diego, killing four people.  The recall in November involving the floor mats did not apply to the company's Canadian vehicles. But Toyota Canada said it would still make changes to the gas pedals and floors of some of its vehicles and install a brake override system on some.  Toyota said Thursday's recall is due to potential problems with the actual gas pedal mechanism, causing the accelerator to become stuck regardless of whether the vehicle contains a floor mat. Toyota said in certain rare cases, the gas pedal mechanism wears down, causing the accelerator to become harder to press, slower to return or, in some cases, stuck.  In a letter to federal safety officials dated Thursday, Toyota said the problem appeared to be related to the potential build-up of condensation on sliding surfaces in the accelerator system that helps drivers push down or release the gas pedal.  Toyota spokesman John Hanson said the automaker does not yet have a solution to the latest problem but is working to develop one. Hanson said the company is unaware of any accidents or injuries due to the gas pedal problems associated with Thursday's recall, but could not rule it out for sure. He said the recall ""came together very quickly,"" and said Toyota will soon be contacting owners directly about the matter.  Hanson added that all of the vehicles involved in the latest recall contain a gas pedal system that comes from a single supplier. He declined to identify the supplier or say whether Toyota would continue doing business with the supplier.  ""Responsibility for this in the end is ours,"" he said.  The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said in a statement that the problem is ""a serious safety issue and we are pleased Toyota is taking immediate action to address it.""  Toyota recommends that drivers of the recalled vehicles should firmly apply their brakes if the gas pedal becomes stuck - not pump the brakes - and contact their nearest Toyota dealer after parking in a safe location.  The safety stumbles have dinged Toyota's reputation in the U.S. as a builder of dependable, high-quality cars. Last year's recall was the sixth-largest ever in the United States.  Toyota said 1.7 million vehicles are affected by both recalls, meaning their accelerator pedals could be at risk both of becoming trapped under floor mats and becoming stuck due to mechanical problems. The vehicles affected by both recalls are the 2005-2010 Avalon, the 2007-2010 Camry and the 2007-2010 Tundra.  The recall in November involving the floor mats did not apply to the company's Canadian vehicles.  But Toyota Canada said it would still make changes to the gas pedals and floors of some of its vehicles and install a brake override system on some.  And in a situation unique to Canada, the company recommended Toyota Venza owners take out any Toyota-brand drivers'-side all-weather floor mats. Toyota-brand carpeted floor mat were OK if properly installed and secured, it said."

424917,corvette1,2010-01-22 21:11:00,1765,its not just the big three i see
424920,Marko,2010-01-22 21:17:00,854,"I see how that can be a problem. I wonder if you got pulled over for speeding in one these Toyota cars, would you be able to use a stuck gas pedal as an excuse I am sorry police officer but my gas pedal was stuck."
424921,jediangler,2010-01-22 21:33:00,1923,I applaud rather than condemn Toyota for these recalls. Did you remember how hard it was to get Ford to take responsibility for the roll overs on the Explorers a few years back? They spent all their time trying to blame tire manufacturers rather than coming out and taking the heat themselves. They hired the tire company to make a tire at Ford's specs for the Explorer. They would have kept on making unsafe vehicles if not pressured into taking responsibility.
424926,SRT8 smoker craft,2010-01-22 21:44:00,1107,this was announced months ago and as far as I know a lot have been fixed by the dealer network and the matts were not the problem it was the accelorator itself (which is made by a supplier) and toyota is still taking the hit to repair this problem its to bad someone had to die for the problem to come to light .
424928,SRT8 smoker craft,2010-01-22 21:48:00,1107,One more thing the article says that the lexus accelerated to over 190k's and the majority if not all toyota's are governed at 160 or 180Kph so not sure where they got that number unless it was modified .
424931,outllaw,2010-01-22 21:59:00,1232,well its not just the american car companies. the facts are. imports are just as prone to design failure.. you want vehicles cheaper. there you have it.anybody into after market gas pedals lol.
424933,Roy,2010-01-22 22:07:00,13728, Lexus is manufactured by Toyota.
424935,Roy,2010-01-22 22:11:00,13728,I bought a 2010 Corolla in August. J has a total of 2000 KM on it so far.  I called the dealership today for an appointment.

424950,jediangler,2010-01-22 22:59:00,1923,All these models mentioned are made in North America by Canadians and Americans including the Lexus model. These are not imports but domestics and do not reflect the quality of vehicles made in Japan.

424960,lookinforwalleye,2010-01-22 23:20:00,4399,"OMG!! say it aint so, I thought Honda and Toyota were perfect!!!"
424969,CLofchik,2010-01-22 23:44:00,854,"This whole mess reminds me of the Audi 5000 unintended acceleration scare in the 80's.  Every single case was traced back to operator error, but it still wrecked a car company for years.  Only here, apparently North Americans are incapable of operating floor mats safely.  No wonder there are warning on Xerox cartridges warning people ""DO NOT EAT TONER""          Sorry but that ain't the same ball park, it ain't the same league, it ain't even the same sport!   In California."
424983,Billy Bob,2010-01-23 00:24:00,5865,"I own a 2007 TUNDRA and it hasn't been back to the dealership since I purchased it in 6/07....got the silly letter from Toyota that my TUNDRA ""might"" be involved with the recall because of the floor mats.....my factory floor mats are anchored down with hooks so they cannot slide under the accelerator pedal....needless to say I haven't heard back from Toyota since about Oct '09.......but if my truck was under the recall all you had to do is remove the frigging floor mats until you took it back in to Toyota for them to probably install the anchor hooks that prevent the mats from sliding forward and MAYBE under the accelerator pedal.........IS THIS THE BEST THE TOYOTA HATERS HAVE TO HANG THEIR HATS ON.......GIVE ME A BREAK."
424998,outllaw,2010-01-23 01:16:00,1232,well to avoid arguments. maybe thats why kyle bush crashes so much.
425040,SRT8 smoker craft,2010-01-23 04:04:00,1107, Yes they are RX 350's are build in cambridge and japan
425042,John Bacon,2010-01-23 04:10:00,3277," While initially there was some talk of the problem being caused by floor mats, it has since been determined that the problem is with the accelerator itself."
425046,SRT8 smoker craft,2010-01-23 04:20:00,1107, Billy Bob take your truck in to get the accelorator pedal replaced the initial reports said it was the mat but they have now released new info (communicated to employees and a press release before x-mas) that the problem was the pedal itself and taking out the mats or having anchor hook does not fix the problem. It is free and doesn't take long 2 bolts and 1 wire conection prolly take a half hour
425075,Tybo,2010-01-23 14:35:00,1373,"First, This is a National road safety act re-call. This means that the car is unsafe to be on the road.They will first give the car company a chance to re-cal the said vehicles to do what ever to make the vehicle safe . If they don't comply they will pull all said vehicle off the road. Then theirs the manufactures re-call. this has nothing to do with safety In a manufactures ra-call,If you don't have that vehicle you will not here about it.  In the Ford explorer. The final report was not the blame of Ford nor Firestone. It was the people themselves. What they found. Is the front tires had 50 pounds of air.when there should be 36lbs. The 50 lbs is the max rate for the tire they use. The engineers designed the vehicle for 36lbs in the front. Most people read the  pressure off the tire. the tire is made for a multitudes of applications, Not that one vehicle. This is why you use the tag on the inside of the drive door. to find the proper inflation of your vehicle tires."
425078,Tybo,2010-01-23 14:50:00,1373,And by the way. Out of all the the GM vehicle I have owned. Not one had a National road safety act re-call.
425093,Billy Bob,2010-01-23 16:04:00,5865, I guess you never heard of the Chevy Corvair. GM had to seize making these cars because they were so UNSAFE. Ralph Nader even wrote a book on how dangerous this vehicle was.
