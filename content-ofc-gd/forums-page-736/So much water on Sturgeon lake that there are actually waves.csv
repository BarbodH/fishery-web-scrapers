Well, I was going to try until I looked out the window and saw the waves that is. I fear there are going to be some ice huts frozen in as soon as the temp drops again. Be careful if you are going out."
425746,Sinker,2010-01-25 21:07:00,8692,We're gonna gain a whole lot of ice once that all freezes!! Should be easy access everywhere next weekend.  s.
425764,aplumma,2010-01-25 21:44:00,6896,I never thought about the water trapped on top of the ice and freezing in the huts. What do you do in that case??? Not that I will ever have that issue...just curious.  Art
425779,Sinker,2010-01-25 22:09:00,8692,"You anchor your hut down thru a hole, and prop it up on blocks so its above the water/slush. Ours is sitting high and dry right now on scugog.  S."
425790,Greencoachdog,2010-01-25 22:38:00,8163, I knew drilling all those holes was going to catch up to you Cliff!!!     Jackhammer!
425797,Jer,2010-01-25 23:00:00,1426,"   ...as long as we get some snow from now til then, otherwise bring your skates."
425804,Sinker,2010-01-25 23:29:00,8692,"  No snow for me thanks. I'll take glare ice anytime. Not so good for guys with sleds, but driving and walking (with cleats) will be a breeze. A good set of cleats are worth thier weight in gold on glare ice.  They're calling for a few flurries all week, so we'll have to see what happens. We could get nothing, or we could get pounded.......you never know.  S."
