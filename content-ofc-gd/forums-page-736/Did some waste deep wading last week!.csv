425616,irishfield,2010-01-25 14:19:00,26272, Yah wouldn't be complaining if it was her though would ya??? Sent that pic to Roy...
425617,irishfield,2010-01-25 14:20:00,26272," Well let the wife hit all the jewlery stores she wants. Just remember to ask, sympathetically, that a nice cold beer would go good about now..."
425619,BillM,2010-01-25 14:24:00,17367,"Wayne, I am sure you would have cleaned up with a few small jig heads and some shrimp!!!!  I'm sure all the planes had you smiling the entire time... Were you critiquing their landings?  lol"
425624,bigbuck,2010-01-25 14:42:00,2449,"Wayne, if the wife needs hot and dry, get yer butts down to Arizona. Real Estate is still cheap down there and from what I hear from a buddy of mine who's a teacher in Yuma, there are much worse places to live. Don't mess with her health by dilly-dallying. BTW, we went to St.Maarten for our honeymoon almost 7 years ago and stayed at the Maho. Yes it's loud with the planes coming in starting at 7am but it's kinda cool. I rented a Fat Boy for the day (a 100th anniversary model) and toured the whole island, it takes about 45mins to go all the way around. It's a nice island, did you go to Philipsburg when there was a cruise ship around?? (prices go up 50%) We met a bunch of people from Canada, 2 couples from the GTA who were friends of friends and another couple from Winnipeg who were friends of friends of my wife's (who is from the 'Peg). We had a blast and the one fellow from Winnipeg was a pilot for the Canadian Forces (co-pilot in a Herc) and I spent a fair bit of time getting blasted around the beach by the jet blast (we weren't too stupid to get very close) and he critiqued the landings. Prettty cool that they have to make a quick turn right after rotation or else they'll hit a mountain."
425850,irishfield,2010-01-26 01:57:00,26272,"Everyone always says to go to Arizona bigbuck.. but it is actually #1 on the top ten list of the WORST places for someone with degenerative lung disease, Asthma, or COPD, to go in the USA.   Apparently the best place is Arkansas   ..but then again they are taking into account not only the clean air etc... but the amount of COPD specialists and clinics they have there. So it may not be the best place to live.. but the best place for health care facilities... and why a decision isn't as cut and dry (no pun intended) as you think."
425873,TJQ,2010-01-26 02:48:00,7806,Looks like a great trip.. that pic of the plane over the beach is cool...
425926,Spiel,2010-01-26 11:03:00,9065,"You're spoiled, you're both spoiled.  I'm sorry that the weather didn't cooperate for Leah's sake. Perhaps a trip to Arizona to visit 2R's is in order.      They probably just don't understand that the fuselage generates no lift."
425987,Moosebunk,2010-01-26 15:40:00,3970,I thought this place seemed kinda quiet lately.  Funny that at work someone was just talking about the runway in St. Maartens where the jets blow kids off the beach.  Then you prove it with your sneaky sneak last minute tropical getaway.  Feel better Leah.  Enjoyed the report.
426019,bigbuck,2010-01-26 17:33:00,2449,"Well, it sounds like you are doing your homework. Just get her somewhere that is more comfortable for her whether it's hot and dry or hot and humid, hopefully there will be decent fisihing for you nearby. Good luck to you guys."
426028,irishfield,2010-01-26 18:00:00,26272,Here's a video of a departure. Note a few people mysteriously disappear! lol     For those that the imbed don't work for  http://www.youtube.com/user/irishfield#p/a/u/0/Wj2YI6w400I
426036,bigugli,2010-01-26 18:30:00,6138,Need higher deflection wall.
426062,johnnyb,2010-01-26 20:06:00,3413,"Very cool report and pics, Wayne...glad you guys had a fun time!"
426064,irishfield,2010-01-26 20:17:00,26272," There is no deflection wall !  It's a tourist trap and they know it and milk it for all it's worth. I wish I owned the Sunset Bar that's for sure!! I guess the airport commission is waiting for someone to get killed before they wake up (pun intended). People hang onto the fence when the Air France's 340 Airbus or the Conair 747 are departing. They look like superman with their feet almost straight out .. taking the wash of over 200,000 lbs of thrust!!!!  Like I said in the post we saw at least two, of the many that we saw get turtled into the sand by departing jets, wearing neck collars the following day!! ...and yah... they were still playing in the jet wash!  Here's the runway from the street... "
426075,fishnsled,2010-01-26 21:42:00,3520,Looks like a great time Wayne.  Great pics too.  I hope that Leah is feeling better.
426090,Rattletrap2,2010-01-26 22:12:00,1652,Nice pics Wayne! I think the only thing more annoying than the jets and rain would have been running into Saul Korman down there! LOL
426129,Greencoachdog,2010-01-26 23:44:00,8163,"  Yeah, that's a Killer Lizard fish!!!... saw a 2 footer pulled in on a party boat once, half the body length is mouth with teeth that would make a muskie envious.  Nice report and pics Wayne!... I see the lovely Miss Leah is looking as lovely as ever!"
425498,irishfield,2010-01-25 01:24:00,26272,"Leah's health was going down hill.. so I jumped on Redtag.ca and tried to find a nice hot spot to take her to shake and bake as a surprise birthday present. Found a deal to St. Maarten (haven't been there since '91). Of course the    at Redtag, despite me telling them not to, made a ""courtesy"" call.. and Leah answered the phone !  Anyhow.. couldn't have asked for a nicer bird to go south on. Brand spanking new 737-700.. in service for only 3 days. Had that new car smell.. but unfortunately no entertainment system installed!      Scares some watching that wing bend!    Breakfast of champions...    Land Ho !    Short final..    Everyone out....nothing like a shiny new airplane..    After reading some reviews on this place, the Sonesta Maho, after booking.. I was a tad worried what we were going to find, but I can certainly live with this!    Still wonder what the temp was in the pool.. never did stick my toe in it. Never do with a swim up pool bar!!      Not a bad place at all... our room was way up there under the E in Sonesta.    One of the complaints about this place in the reviews was the noise.. and yes it is a noisy place and after 7 days it even got on the nerves of two pilots.. US. But while it was still neat I got some arrival shots... Delta    LIAT's Dash 8 (LIAT = Leave Island Any Time)    Jet Blue    The American Eagle    The Island of Saba.. we meant to get over there this time to check it out, but it didn't happen.    Our room view..    Sunset    Air France getting ready to depart... and to blow the people off the beach!      U.S. Airways coming in for landing.    The arrival board at Sunset bar.. so you know when to run out and get your pictures.    If you ever go to St. Maarten.. the food is great at the Sunset and cheap enough.. just don't sit and drink there. $5 US a beer.. and they give you the midget Carib bottles. The gal at the opposite end of the beach will sell you two full size bottles of Carib for $4 !!!   .. or you can walk another 100 feet and buy 2 for $2.50 in the grocery store    If people would only believe these signs.. saw a few get turtled into the sand by departing jets.. and saw them with neck collars on the next day!      Saw this shirt and thought of GBFisher!    Where I dropped a good portion of my allowance..     .. but the drinks was free!    Full frontal nudity!    What do you mean I can't have one of these..    American Airlines coming in.    Shot inside the casino that Leah got crap for taking.    One thing that hasn't changed in St. Maarten in two decades.... you can get a free drink in any jewlery store by simply asking.    Now finally some fishing. Took a dollar store telescopic and a decent reel. Loaded up a plastic box with some different spoons and such.        Doesn't get much better than this.. Fishing and women in bikinis..or less!    Another day I tried the pier area in Marigot. Lots of action in the water.. gars swimming by, some hard hits, and managed to at least pull in what the locals call a lizard fish. That Dollar store rod held up pretty darn good for what I wanted to do.  The boat parking.. I think that guy, with the bass boat, that was at the last Lakair G2G must live down here! Those that were there know what I mean!!        Drying rack after rinsing my fishing gear.    Not sure what I said... but I think it was the right thing..    Glad we knew this thing was coming to town that day.... along with 5 other smaller ships and that we didn't go into Phillipsburg while it was there. 5000 passengers on this thing.    Our final sunset before going home the next afternoon.    We almost didn't get back home... the Island Rep Company for Westjet forgot to pick us up at our hotel. Made the airport in time, by alternate transportation, to get the last 2 seats.. and luckily together (although staring at the bulkhead in 1E and F). Flight was then delayed departing by over an hour.. but we still made it home by midnight, to beat the landing curfew.  If anyone is considering travelling there.. send me a PM and I'll give you some tips to the last remaining hassle free beaches that remain. I won't publish them on the interweb....as I want them to still be this way when I move there!  Will add a video or two later."
425501,danbouck,2010-01-25 01:30:00,4380,Looks like a great trip. My son would love to stand on the beach and watch the planes all day!
425502,Terry,2010-01-25 01:36:00,14456,looks like a great trip  those planes landing that close would freak me out
425503,irishfield,2010-01-25 01:38:00,26272, Don't believe everything you see in the movie Pushing Tin !
425509,Fish Farmer,2010-01-25 02:10:00,2234,"Thanks for sharing Wayne, Man those planes come close. The one picture looks like it kick up the sand and water on the beach. Nice pictures. Now if I could only talk the wife into going."
425517,MCTFisher9120,2010-01-25 02:30:00,3761,"Awesome man! Looks like a trip of a lifetime.  Thanks for the great photo's, MTBF"
425533,Leecher,2010-01-25 03:10:00,7832,Great report and pics Wayne Nice way to celebrate your wife's birthday!!! Lizard fish.... first time seeing one of those I see that you had a five of diamonds in your arsenal.... any luck with it?? Thanks for taking the time to post and share your trip with us!!! Leechman
425534,irishfield,2010-01-25 03:12:00,26272,Nope... they seem to like Gold. The lizard fish was on a small williams half/half hammered... as were all the other hits.  I am told there are 80 lb Tarpon in the Simpson Lagoon... just couldn't find a friendly access point to try it out. Place sure isn't like it was 19 years ago...
425538,Ron,2010-01-25 03:17:00,1683,"Glad you had an excellent holiday Wayne. I'm sure Leigh thanked you many times for that!  I know exactly why she is smiling in this pic.....   You were probably saying ""Yes dear, you are right, I am wrong...again...""  Ironically I was checking out this place on ""youtube"", said something about the shortest approach runway in the world. Pretty kewl!  Cheers, Ron..."
425539,Gerry,2010-01-25 03:19:00,257,"Wayne, I was there a week before on one of those cruise ships. Darn ship wouldn't slow down so I could do a little trolling."
425541,irishfield,2010-01-25 03:21:00,26272, And that's anything new?    Just wish that we didn't have rain 5 days out of 7... she didn't come back any healthier unfortunately.
425545,douG,2010-01-25 03:31:00,2693,"I know your vacation was the best thing for both of you, Wayne, and your lovely Leah.  Thanks for your photos, and Good Health to youse."
425546,Joey,2010-01-25 03:35:00,9122,"Looks like a nice trip, sorry to hear Leah didn't come back any healthier.  I think you need to take her to Arizona Pronto!!!  Start booking that one Wayne  Great photos and I can certainly understand the noise problem, but heck, it beats my desk at work any day of the week.  I could adapt     I actually think it would be pretty cool for a week to see the planes come and go.  Nice little fishy too  Joey"
425549,darsky,2010-01-25 03:44:00,586,"Go figure-95% of pics taken are of aircraft  glad you had a great trip. I,myself am leaving for Turks & Caicos in a few days."
425552,irishfield,2010-01-25 03:47:00,26272," We're gonna get this winter out of the way.. and then I think it might just be time for me to hang up the rivet gun for good, sell and move Joey. The hard part is finding a climate that will work for her (and figuring out what to do with the ""inventory"" around here.. read my junk!). Winter here would be just fine if it would stay good and cold, and none of this rain crap. In the mean time I think Leah is going to go down to her Father's in Cape Coral FL, with her sister, while I'm up at the lake with the lads in February."
425553,corvette1,2010-01-25 04:12:00,1765,congrats to the both of you what a trip
425574,Sinker,2010-01-25 06:11:00,8692,That was an awful nice birthday gift Wayne. Too bad about the weather. Those planes are CLOSE.....WOW!  P.S......my birthday is in march  S.
425576,redneck666,2010-01-25 06:42:00,563,"wow, that looks like a super great trip!"
425585,Rich Clemens,2010-01-25 11:28:00,3131,"Kinda gives to meaning to ""Hop on a Plane"" eh ?    Thanks for sharing Wayne."
425591,Roy,2010-01-25 12:33:00,13728,Glad you guys had a great time....nice report.  A few more pics of Leah wouldn't have killed you yanno.
425595,bigugli,2010-01-25 12:55:00,6138,"Sorry to hear the Mrs health isn't doing well with our climate.  You will simply have to join the flock of snowbirds (I know, easier said than done!)  I would find all that air traffic annoying for about 2 weeks, then it becomes background noise."
425603,splashhopper,2010-01-25 13:40:00,2931,"your post reminds me of a song :  "" took a trip and never even left the farm""  ...  I  think Leah was smiling because you took the shirt off that said she was named ""fear"""
425604,ketchenany,2010-01-25 13:42:00,3229,"Irish, that looks great will be there next Wednesday, but only for the day . . . one stop on our 7-day cruise."
425605,capt_hooked,2010-01-25 13:42:00,212,Leslie and I jsut enjoyed viewing your post and pics...  we especially enjoyed the warning sign... about departing aircraft... causing injury or death.... now that's an adventure... possibility of death on the beach! (lets drink . way too much ... and go look at the planes...  woooooah...! that was close...!)   about that fish.. hey... I caught that very same fish off a Florida pier in December (I swear!)... sure gets around for a little guy...!  best regards from the 2 of us to the 2 of U..!  the capt and his first mate...
425608,Headhunter,2010-01-25 13:51:00,5703,"Nice pics and report Wayne... sorry it didn't work as planned for Leah, but I suspect you could try again and again.... Could done without the topless shot though! HH"
