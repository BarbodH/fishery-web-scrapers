425737,Rich Clemens,2010-01-25 20:43:00,3131,"Hey Pete: I think you can just add some blank lines in between the tags for the pics and you're putting your post together.  That is, put your first pic in the post. After the closing img tag for the pic, hit the enter a couple times to enter some blank lines. Then, plug in your second pic, and do the same thing. You can use these blank lines for your comments.  That's the way I do it anyway. Hope this helps."
425742,BITEME,2010-01-25 20:56:00,1968,Is this by putting the pictures in Photo Bucket some place or is this by running them straight from the computer to the message im posting the later s the way I have always done it in the past. Thanks  Peter
425745,Sinker,2010-01-25 21:02:00,8692,"Easiest way is to upload your pics to photobucket. Once your pics are uploaded in there, there is 4 codes under the pics. Copy the bottom code ( IMG) into your thread where you want it and bob's your uncle. If you need anymore help, just ask.  I would love to see your tutorial, I have to do my water pump and shift shaft seals on mine over the winter too, and I've never had the LU off before.  S."
425785,Rich Clemens,2010-01-25 22:25:00,3131,"Pete.  My thoughts would be after you've already uploaded the pics to photbucket, or whatever host you are using.  As you're creating your new post in here, you have to click on the little picture ICON to enter the URL of the image.  Once you say OK to the promt to include the image into your post, you should see your URL between two img tags.  This is where your picture would be.   Something like this.  [imx]http://THe'>http://The URL to your image is here[/imx]  After the closing /img tag of the image, you should be able to hit the ENTER key to space things down a bit, then just type into these blank lines.  (NOTE:  I changed the img tag to imx so that you can see the format. Key want you want, then insert the next image, and do the same [imx]http://THe URL to your image is here[/imx]"
425798,Greencoachdog,2010-01-25 23:04:00,8163,"Yeah, should look like this:    Your text here  [ im?] your pic here[im?]  Your text here  [im?]your pic here[im?]  Your text here  [im?] your pic here[im?]    Get it? Got it?... Good!!!"
425802,Sinker,2010-01-25 23:24:00,8692,"Just type your text, then paste the IMG code under the photobucket picture. It will show as text as your writing your post, but when you preview/post it, it will come up as a picture. No need to hit any insert pic ICONS. Its just another confusing step that is not required.  All you have to do is click on the IMG code for the picture and it will automatically copy it, then just paste it in as text. Trust me, a picture will show up.    S."
