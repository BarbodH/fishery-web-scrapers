425434,shadowfly,2010-01-24 22:13:00,84,Hey guys it's time for me to upgrade my waders. the once i have now are damaged (with a hole in the shoe. cheap walmart bush lite brand.) I'm looking to get waders that will last me few years at least. any recommendation. yet I don't want to go crazy spending extreme $$$$$ on waders. thanks in advanced.
425439,BillM,2010-01-24 22:20:00,17367,See if you can find a pair Riverteks by Simms..  Not as pricey as the G4 waders and have served me very well for over a year of some hardcore steelhead fishing.

425463,Douger,2010-01-24 23:31:00,116,"I second both the Cabela's and the Simms. I have a pair of Simms G3 and love them.  They may call them the G3 Guide now.  A classic, widely used wader.  I think I saw them for $300 at Bass Pro.  Word is stay away from Bass Pro brand breatheables.  Never owned a pair myself but they apparently are prone to leaking.  Many guys speak highly of the Cabela's brand waders.  If you are looking for neoprenes (good in cold weather but don't breathe), Cabela's have a great pair for US$129 in the waterfowl/hunting section.  Cheers"

I agree with Dr. Salvelinus, Cabelas store brand waders are an excellent value, my wife has had a pair for 3 years now, no issues.  Regardless of what brand you get, make sure they fit you properly in the crotch.  If they don't fit you in the crotch, no matter how good or expensive they are, that's where they'll rip."
