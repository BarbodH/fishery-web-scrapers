423580,juventus77,2010-01-18 17:24:00,8,"Hey There  Im new to this never posted anything before. Im heading up to Lake Nippising the first weekend in Feb, staying at Glen echo. Has any one been there recently? Hows the fishing there? Your comments would be greatly appriciated.  Thanks"
423629,Calender Don,2010-01-18 20:11:00,39,"I haven't been there lately for ice fishing, but the last time I was there the hut where big and very clean inside and the fishing was good too. I go there every spring and fall I love it there."
423819,splitshot,2010-01-19 11:55:00,6,"I was there 4yrs ago, they were great but, put no effort into the hut placement. Right out in front the lodge, 40yrds off shore. Needless to say we didn't catch anything from friday to sunday. Hopefully things have changed!"
424543,oakej,2010-01-21 18:21:00,7,"Hi juventus77  I have a trip booked at Glen Echo, for Feb. 4-7 so maybe i will see you there."
424559,Woodsman,2010-01-21 19:36:00,1286,New owners in the last couple of years. They are still suffering from the previous owners reputation. I have heard good reports on the new owners although I have not personally dealt with them.
424565,oakej,2010-01-21 20:08:00,7,Thank you for the report Woodsman... I was getting a little concerned about the trip.  Thanks
424566,Fish4Eyes,2010-01-21 20:19:00,1022,"The old crook owners charged me 60$ to use their truck to put my boat in the water and pull it out, as my jetta could not handle the steep slope of the launch  . As for fishing, I only fished there in the spring, with mild success."
424570,Lunkerhunter,2010-01-21 20:38:00,455,"i havent fished up at glen echo but i did buy my outboard from them this past summer and my limited dealings with the owner were quite good. he was friendly, informative and pretty reasonable. he showed me around the camp and even let me test out the boats , he definetely didnt seem like a dick or a crook.  again i havent fished there, just did some business with the guy."
424611,tb4me,2010-01-21 23:36:00,3295,You will catch fish! we went for a weekend last year.Huts are spotless well put together. The keep the outhouse on the ice heated and light all night long.I have had nothing but good experiences with them. The one sat aft we were there we werent getting any hits at all. We asked him to drill us some holes outside the hut. He did one better. He moved us to his personal hut for the afternoon..Caught a ton of fish..He will actually come in and sit n have a beer with ya's.. Even have tv.s so you wont miss the Leafs game...LOL So in short they do a good service and do  an exellent job at making sure you want to come back..Have fun and say hi from Ron
425661,oakej,2010-01-25 16:51:00,7,Great report tb4me.  Thanks
425703,bubbles,2010-01-25 19:37:00,591,"was there in the summer once a long time ago, nice boats!  I have always heard they have issues with the placement of their huts, on spot, close to shore, never moves them....  not first hand experience though."
425705,Woodsman,2010-01-25 19:44:00,1286,Bubbles if you would have taken time to read the previous replies you may have noticed there is new owners. They already have enough of a problem living down the previous owners deeds without more old misdeeds being placed on them.
425794,tb4me,2010-01-25 22:51:00,3295,"Hey no problem..Thier Honest people, They  deserve a  good report..The owners are great at what they do!..I was very impressed. They even  let us book the ice hut in the spring (may 24 weekend) on land, rented  a boat..They have excellent boat packages available at great rates in the boating season.."
425956,oakej,2010-01-26 13:43:00,7,"Thanks again tb4me.  I will give a full report when I return. I can't wait, i'm like a kid in a candy store."
