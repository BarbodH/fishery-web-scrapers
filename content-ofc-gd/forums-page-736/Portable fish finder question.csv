My question is about the tranducer,  does it have to be under the ice line, or can it sit just under the water.  If it has tobe under the ice how do u use it.  Do u make a stick that keeps it level or a sponge like what the vex uses.  Any help would be appreciated  Dave"

425800,Woodsman,2010-01-25 23:21:00,1286,This is how I done it.  49 cent piece of foam from a surplus store. A strap used for attaching a chain link fence to the post + a bolt & nuts. A few of electrical pull ties. Play with the transducer and strap/cable angles until the transducer hangs level then tighten everything. Tighten ties on foam until the cable is tight to pull through the foam so it will hold but still adjustable. And yes place the transducer below the ice for best results.
