359561,largefish,2009-07-07 23:02:00,35,Can someone suggest some good spots to go fishing from the shore around Pinery Provincial Park and Grand Bend? I'm leaving tomorrow to go camping.
359567,Beats,2009-07-08 00:16:00,543,"I would advise renting a canoe for a few hours and fishing the Ausable cut.  As far as you can canoe you will find lm bass, small pike, perch, bullheads, and random panfish.  If you aren't able to get a canoe, anywhere on shore should have opportunities for fish.  I really do advise getting a canoe.  From my experiences there, they don't really care if you bring it back late so long as they still have plenty of canoes around.  We usually get a bunch of pike on Mepps spinners."

359710,Beats,2009-07-08 11:17:00,543,Im just referring to where the park rents out canoes.  It's a man made channel with lots of vegetation.  http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&source...mp;t=h&z=18
