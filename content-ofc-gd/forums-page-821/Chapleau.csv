He set the hook on a 41""Northern that he did awsome on.All I did for him was net the fish.Talk about a proud dad.A quick pic and we set her free.He didnt want to hold the fish for a pic,he was still in awe.  The Northern was caught on a Williams spoon.  Walleye were caught on green jigs tipped with a white twister tail and a minnow.  The majority of our eyes were found in 9fow along wind blown shore lines.  "
