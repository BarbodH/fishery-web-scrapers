359314,mpagnan,2009-07-07 13:57:00,84,"Good morning all,  I'm going to be heading out to a couple streams tonight fishing deep pools for smallies and I was wondering what are the suggested baits for bass creek/river fishing?  Would crayfish plastics texas rigged work the best?  Thanks for the advice."
359316,Stoty,2009-07-07 14:00:00,2910,Jigs/small crankbaits should do the trick.
359318,LucG,2009-07-07 14:07:00,779,"Like Stoty said, Jiggs and smaller, shallow diving cranbaits always do the trick.  I allways bring some topwater lures though, use them in calm pools or on the edge of weeds."
359320,mpagnan,2009-07-07 14:10:00,84,What bait should I add to the jig?
359329,spinnerbaitking,2009-07-07 14:18:00,1622,"SPINNERBAITS always work, MOstly, SOMEtimes, mAybe, or tubes, Jerk Baits & did I say SPINNERBAITS, evening try something with red or black in it Richard"
359331,mpagnan,2009-07-07 14:23:00,84,"Would 5"" Berkley Leeches texas rigged with a 3/O hook be too large for smallies?"
359351,johnnyb,2009-07-07 15:08:00,3413,"You won't know unless you try...    My vote is that no, they won't be too big."
359392,Stoty,2009-07-07 16:57:00,2910,"Depends on the size of the creek I guess. Obviously...the smaller the creek, generally the smaller the fish.  Is it a creek or a river you're fishing?"
359394,Mike Pike,2009-07-07 17:06:00,1332,"I love tossing in-line spinners into pools, myself, for smallies.  Just remember to use a ballbearing swivel to help minimize line twist.  Also, try tossing a tube if the fish aren't active.  And when all else fails, and you don't mind messing around with crawlers, a float and worm can save your day.  I actually start with a float and worm on many of my river outings."
359396,Kenny G,2009-07-07 17:13:00,118,Tubes will do the trick. Kenny G.
359398,oxcowboy,2009-07-07 17:21:00,544,"i like using the rebel crank n crawls for creeks ,  and mad man crawdad tubes with a football jig usually work well.  jason"
359399,mepps,2009-07-07 17:25:00,1301,I always did well with spinner baits - #2s and #3s mostly.
359418,BITEME,2009-07-07 18:31:00,1968,CRAYFISH  smallie assinators
359423,ChrisK,2009-07-07 18:42:00,2772,I use night crawlers for small streams........Sometimes under a float.....
359443,Cudz,2009-07-07 19:06:00,2652,"drop shot a gulp leech 3""  I saw a great article in a mag where the guy fished small to medium sized streams.  He uses a 3 way swivel.  Bell sinker on bottom and a  4 inch senk type plastic on a 2/0 or 3/0 hook.  cast out and retrieve slowly.  IF the current is strong you can cst out and leave it there.  Always wanted to try it but I never fish smallies in a stream/river."
359476,mpagnan,2009-07-07 19:48:00,84,"I'll be heading to Bronte tonight with that helps.  I pulled a 17"" out of there the other day with a Wooly.  That was quite the battle."
359510,theRJ,2009-07-07 20:51:00,55,Ultralite crappie tubes in natural colours have worked for me on the credit. Also topwater baits for the bigger ones.
359513,SBCregal,2009-07-07 20:55:00,688,"i'll be at bronte tonight as well, from petro park.  i planned on tossing tubes and a jig/craw. if you see a guy with a black hat and long goatee, come say whats up."
359524,batoathome,2009-07-07 21:18:00,47,don't forget Gulp minnows with a jig.  deadly for non aggressive fish.
359545,Roninramirez,2009-07-07 22:07:00,19,"I would try use a big slip float ( Bigger slip floats cast further) rigged with a 4'inch Berkley leech, adjusted to hover in the strike zone 1-3 feet off bottom. The current will keep sweeping your bait over the fish, just make sure to give it action with your rod tip. But if the fish are feeding higher. Try the white Berkley Jerk shad rigged weightless to cast in the shallows. Let the fish tell you what they want and adjust to that.   Only if we knew how to speak to bass like Kevin Van Dam"
359549,JohnF,2009-07-07 22:18:00,3494,Original floating Rapala minnow in grey colour. Just twitch it a bit on the surface. It's all my buddy will use. If you're in pike water be careful. You'll attract snotrockets too.  JF
