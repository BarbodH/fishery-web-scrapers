With all the concern for spreading exotic species like zebra mussels, spiny waterflea, milfoil, and even worse, fish diseases like VHS, I'm just wondering how many people out there take the necessary precautions with their boats, if they visit multiple lakes in a short period of time.  Personally, I never have the luxury (lack of time) to fish more than once a week, if that, so my boat is garaged 7 days or more between trips with all the locker/livewell lids open to air out and dry. I do notice when I pull out of a ramp that I'll often have vegetation around axles, etc. which I always make sure I clean fully before leaving the ramp.  I just think it's good Angler Conservation to take such steps.  So - for those of you lucky to fish way more than I do, what do you do between lakes?"
