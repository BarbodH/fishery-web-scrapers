Next week Mike and I tried another fav spot and although the numbers weren't as high the quality was there .Nice to be out Mike as well  Mike with a nice largie caught on weightless senkos .  Big fish of the day at 19"" . broke in my $19 Quantum rod nicely ( thanks Cudz) Belly weighted senko  5 fish in total for the day , bit damp but no complaints  TB"
