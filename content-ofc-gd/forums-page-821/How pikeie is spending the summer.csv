Matt is working at Wiley point Lodge on Lake of the Woods for the summer and decided to send me a few pics. no internet connection so he can only send when he has a trip to Kenora and the time.   Of course pike fishing is easy  so is is the bass fishing ,open year round  THIS is even easier with all the rocks and deadheads around , Not Pikeies work   some cool birds as well   a view of the Lodge that the 'SILVER BULLIT' docked up front , two 200 hp rudes move it along pretty well 40 mph plus with 14 people and gear on board. shuttle for moving guests and gear to and from the lodge .  Finally a nice shot from the dock.   An experince he won't soon forget  Will be up there myself come Mid august .  TB"

Take a closer look at the boat behind it. That's one of their work boats. All steel hull, no amenities, goes really fast from point A to point B,   :lol:  Pikie has probably had a ride in it.  Here is where he is working, poor lad.          "
