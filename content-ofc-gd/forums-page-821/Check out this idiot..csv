358228,BillM,2009-07-03 16:27:00,17367,"I think he maybe should trim up the motor a bit more, perhaps then he might just take off into space"
358229,bigfish1965,2009-07-03 16:28:00,3382,Wow...how luck is that guy! Well designed boat was the only reason it didn't topple over and kill him...and driving that speed through someone else's wake with no life jacket and your motor trimmed like that...classic stupid.
358230,NAW,2009-07-03 16:28:00,4022,"Wow,  To much power, not enough brains."
358231,rangervs,2009-07-03 16:28:00,7,LOL
358233,bigfish1965,2009-07-03 16:31:00,3382,I watched it again and he's chine walking without any wake...too much money not enough brains is more like it.
358236,Guest gbfisher,2009-07-03 16:55:00,0,Classic boating amateur!!!  ......Friggin Bass Boat.  ........
358237,johnnyb,2009-07-03 16:57:00,3413,Stupid is as stupid does....WOW
358241,Roy,2009-07-03 17:05:00,13728,"C'mon guys, he can't be that bad. He has a boating competency card eh?"
358242,largefish,2009-07-03 17:08:00,35,"Look at him go...not! Actually, it was the camera guy's boat that caused the wave that almost flipped his boat. Or maybe he just wanted to see how it feels to ride the wave?"
358244,misfish,2009-07-03 17:16:00,29133,"You be amazed how fast that can happen. Never got that twisted out of shape,but close one time during a blast off.."
358258,Fish4Eyes,2009-07-03 17:57:00,1022,"He is stupid, but you have to admit he has some serious balls to jump a wake in a bass boat."
358261,Whitespinnerbait,2009-07-03 18:10:00,2038,Stunt driver .....
358262,Dozer,2009-07-03 18:40:00,896,Is there somethin' wrong with me if I cant stop laughing while I watch this video?  Can only imagine whats going through his head when he's about to fly off into space
358263,charlesn,2009-07-03 18:43:00,551,You mean we're not supposed to drive like that?  Hey y'all watch this!
358279,highdrifter,2009-07-03 20:02:00,2534,That slow motion re-take isn't slow enough.  Almost looked like he demoed himself on the motor...  He's lucky he's not a quadriplegic.  cheers HD
358282,purekgw,2009-07-03 20:06:00,585,i think he might of crapped a little there when he was flying
358480,Skud,2009-07-04 15:30:00,739,If you search on the same site(break.com) for a speedboat wipeout it shows a dude throw himself from his boat and not have his kill switch tied to him.  His $250k boat has a nice landing on the rocky shoreline and roles completly over.
358488,Skud,2009-07-04 15:51:00,739,Here it is  Boat crash
358606,Dara,2009-07-05 01:26:00,3052,"As a new boat owner, I can't say i didn't learn nothing from those"
358614,Greencoachdog,2009-07-05 02:03:00,8163,Typical!   is this John F in his new Ranger???
358696,lunkerbasshunter,2009-07-05 15:03:00,2585,stupid people sometimes.  lucky he is alive
358707,yakpiker,2009-07-05 16:25:00,160,"Came across this while checking out the boat crash site...apologies if this has already been posted, but it just seems crazy!  http://www.break.com/index/surfing-with-a-...hite-shark.html"
359857,tinbanger,2009-07-08 19:54:00,1028,I think Pikeie has a storey that may be similar . An Allsion bass boat on LOW when the driver/pilot torpedoed a big wave .. 5 hours of bailing later ....LOL  Speed kills or at least scares the crap out of you!  TB
359970,TJQ,2009-07-09 02:16:00,7806,hahahahaha
