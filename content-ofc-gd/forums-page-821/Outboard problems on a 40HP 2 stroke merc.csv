359174,dada2727,2009-07-07 00:43:00,108,"I have a 40HP 2 stroke oil injected Merc, it's either a 2004 or 2005 and am having some problems.  The problem only occurs at a higher RPM, most noticably at full throttle.  When I have it wide open, it seems like it's missing or not firing on all cyclinders (its a 3 cylinder) but I just had it tuned up and the carbs cleaned.  It will run fine if I continuously adjust the trim up, down, up, down...and so on, but as soon as I stop adjusting the trim it starts doing it again.  I'm thinking it might be electrical because I just spent $350 getting water removed from the carbs apparently.  I had this problem a couple years ago and I had it fixed and they told me it was something like a ""starter coil"" but I'm not completely sure.  I just remember they showed me some wires that were melted together.  Any thoughts?"
359190,solopaddler,2009-07-07 01:19:00,8605,Although you said the carb's been cleaned it sure sounds like a gummed up carb to me. I'd try one those carb cleaners that you mix with the gas. That's worked for me in the past...
359195,ohhenrygsr,2009-07-07 01:23:00,947,so with the miss firing does it still run or just die out?
359210,dada2727,2009-07-07 02:02:00,108,"still runs, never stalls or anything...just sounds like its missing.  Any recommendations on carb cleaner additives?"
359214,Fisherman,2009-07-07 02:19:00,7201,"Seafoam!  Should be able to get it at Carquest or NAPA.  Sounds like a Stator coil, makes power.."
359239,Sinker,2009-07-07 03:42:00,8692,"Its funny you post this, because my 2 stroke 40 mariner started doing the same thing. Only at WOT. I can run 3/4 throttle no problem, but as soon as I crack on it, she misses.  I have no idea what it is. I was going to post the same question.......it will idle, troll, run at any speed but wide open no problem. As soon as I crank it open it misses, so I back off.  I don't think running seafoam is going to help, I run it in every tank of gas, and I decarb it a few times a year too. She's as clean as a whistle, and the carbs are mint.  I almost thought it was starving for fuel at full throttle?   S."
359273,Garnet,2009-07-07 11:15:00,2056,Try pumping the fuel bulb when wide open might be just losing pressure.  Garnet
359276,fisher,2009-07-07 11:28:00,451,"Are you using fuel without ethanol...?  I swear the issues I had with my 2 stroke 40 HP Merc all started when ethanol was introduced to gas.  Since I had it rebuilt, I have switched to the highest octane gas from Esso, Petro Canada or Shell who do not put ethanol in them (they only put it in their lower grade fuels)."
359450,ohhenrygsr,2009-07-07 19:11:00,947,  I have only found that Shell and Ultramar High test have no ethanol never heard that Esso or Petro didn't have it either
359500,fishermccann,2009-07-07 20:34:00,655,"I agree put in super gas , no more problem."
359520,dada2727,2009-07-07 21:07:00,108,"Well apparently it was just a spark plug, but we'll see.  If it is, I feel kinda stupid but before for some reason I don't think it will be the end of it.  Thanks fisherman, the Stator coil was the part I was thinking about that I replaced last year, some wires were melted together.  To be continued........"
359723,Fish4Eyes,2009-07-08 12:05:00,1022,Doesn't high octane gas make your engine run hotter? Is this recommended by marine mechanics?
359774,fishermccann,2009-07-08 14:32:00,655,it has no alcohol to attract the water.
359869,dada2727,2009-07-08 21:21:00,108,How many people just run regular fuel?
359871,Fisherman,2009-07-08 21:29:00,7201,"Me, in everything unless the mfgr specifically indicates a higher octane requirement.  Google what octane actually does in the combustion cycle of an engine and what kind of motors it is intended for."
359882,danbouck,2009-07-08 22:25:00,4380,I use regular and add stabil ethanol treatment
360109,Sinker,2009-07-09 14:19:00,8692," Ditto!  My problem was a bad o ring on the fuel filter cansiter. So far so good. If I pumped the ball while going WOT she ran fine, so I started at the tank, and worked my way back to the carbs and found the split O-ring.  S."
