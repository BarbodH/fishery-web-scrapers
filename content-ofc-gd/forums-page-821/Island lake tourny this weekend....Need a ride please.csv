359678,simcoe angler,2009-07-08 04:50:00,1,Hello me and my friend are looking to get into the fishing tournament at Island Lake this weekend and was wondering if anyone else on here was going if you had room for 2 more. All we would have with us are our rods and tent and  we would pay a lil for gas. We might like to get a ride back but also we might take the bus we are not sure. We can be picked up in oshawa or toronto please get back to me and let me know
