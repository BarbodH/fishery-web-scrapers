359657,Fishnwire,2009-07-08 03:57:00,983,I always plan on using topwaters for SMbass...but until this past week I hadn't given them much of a try.  I bought one of those Rapala Skitter Walks this winter and I decided to give it a try last time I was out.  My heart is still pounding!  I will be going to the top waters a lot more from now on.  I caught two 16 inchers and then a fat ol' 18 in less than a half hour.  Then the wind picked up and the chop was too much.   I'll never forget the moment that big pig broke water on that Skitter.  SMASH!  SPLASH!  I'm addicted!  I want more!  I have heard of guys raising smallies to the surface from as much as 20 feet of water.  Is this true?
359719,splashhopper,2009-07-08 11:47:00,2931," Fishnwire: I just started top water fishing two weeks ago myself... what a ""blast""  I am having difficulty sleeping now thinking about the next big one..lol  Top water fishing has also opened whole new bodies of water for this boat-less fishermen  to enjoy as well.  Maybe take a scroll back through this Topic post for some very helpful hints from everyone that has helped me in my new addiction."
357375,splashhopper,2009-07-01 02:21:00,2931,any thoughts on the line I am using....  I don't have a boat yet so I am shore fishing all the time...  I don;t have a problem using 6lb test with a 4lb leader for some big rainbows on the Maitland river and am wondering why so many guys are suggesting heavy braid around 20-30 lbs;..  thanks again
357383,BillM,2009-07-01 02:32:00,17367,"You could get away with 15lb-20lb braid to pull those fish through the slop.   It's after the fish hits initially that you usually need to haul them out of the thick stuff.  If you are open water fishing topwaters, 6lb-8lb mono is fine.."
357406,Burning Babies,2009-07-01 04:25:00,150,"Fighting rainbows in open water and bass in slop are almost opposite applications.  Fighting bass in slop, it all comes down to a the hook set and a couple seconds after.  You are setting a big hook into a tough mouth, potentially with the line already half way round a log or pad root by the time you hit them.  Then, you need to get the fish turned and coming out immediately, or a good fish will wrap around something and often get enough slack to throw the hook.  You should be using an extremely stout (for bass) rod and a reel with the drag cranked down tight to do so.  Heavy line is necessary to handle the shock, and in extremely heavy cover, the fish will never see the line anyway.  With spinning tackle, you might consider going a little lower, because you are likely to break your rod long before the 30 lb braid, but I avoid spinning tackle for slop fishing bass when I can."

357818,CLofchik,2009-07-02 16:58:00,854,"Another vote for the Rapala Skitter Pop.  I don't know if they still make them out of balsa or have gone to plastic already, but after being a Pop-R devotee for years I picked up two balsa Skitter Pops when the store was sold out of Pop-R's and never looked back.  The trick I learned about poppers is that it's not about the sound we can perceive, but how much water the popper can spit out infront of it.  It's all about the spit with poppers.  Once you get in the right groove you can twitch a Skitter Pop 6"" but spit water 2' infront of it, works well.   I'm always using a braid/flouro combo, what I found works well is rubbing a candle or piece of paraffin on the flouro to keep it floating."
357927,Burning Babies,2009-07-02 21:03:00,150," It seems to me that coating flouro in wax would largely defeat the purpose of flouro (i.e. the wax undoubtedly would have a different refractive index than water, rendering the ""invisible"" flouro visible)."

359106,Roy,2009-07-06 21:37:00,13728,"Tie on the largest float you have on there, cast it out there and pick at the line till it's all free. Then you can reel it in tight.  Be patient and don't pull hard on the line when you know it's looped. You'll just make it worse."
359122,Burning Babies,2009-07-06 22:19:00,150,"What Roy said.  If you see a few snarls forming in your line, make sure you take the time to straighten them before they develop into a real problem.  That said, crane or barrel swivels like the one you have on in the pictures do virtually nothing to eliminate line twist.  Try attaching an inline spinner and watching the bait in the water; both ends of the swivel will rotate right along with your bait.  Besides that, the topwaters you are casting don't rotate, so they don't twist your line.  Your problem is either the result of how you spooled the line, or your reel.  Beautiful smallie, BTW."

356734,muddler,2009-06-29 13:53:00,623,"I've just about just about all the top water lures out there. My favourite open water surface lures are, Chug Bugs (even the Dollar store knock off - just change the hooks), Poppers (any type), jitterbuggs. For weeddy watter I like weedles Rats, and plastic frogs, Moss Boss and a big 10-12 inch plastic worm rigged weedless. Buzz baits are great for fishing weeds too.  I make my own Jumbo pork frogs and fish these on weed mats with a a weedless 2/0 hook.  If there is a small opening in the weed mat I'll let the frog slowly sink out of sight. watch the line for any twich on the line. I do the same this with large plastic worms (sinking not  floating). The floating worms rigged weedles (10-12 inches) look like a snake and can be stopped in the middle of a weed patch, often with explosive results.  I use top water lures when the water is calm (mostly early morning and evening). A heavy chop doesn't work for  me.  I try ever retieve . I usually start witha a slow stop and go stop and go twitch. If tha doesn't get result the I speed up the retrieve.  Buzz baits have a continuous retrive or they sink. Lures tha float, I will cast out and let all the ripple  disappear before I move the lure.  I use 30 lb braided line as it floats also. Always wait that couple of seconds after a strike to 'feel' the fish before setting the hook.  Make SURE that your hooks are stcky sharp.  muddler"

It comes in a variety of shapes, sizes and colours. All of them work.  Another good topwater bait to try is the Tiny Torpedo. Zip it accross in short pulls or simply retrieve constant like a buzzbait (or any combination).  I've also got a Spro-frog like the one in your other post and like it a lot for the heavy cover. You can chuck it anywhere, a bit tougher to get a hook-up, but any bait on top of the slop will get missed more than not.  Enjoy your new topwater addiction. you'll find you're throwing topwater even when you shouldn't be, it's such a blast. Be wary of pike & musky, you'll probably lose a few baits if they're around. I usually get more musky strikes when topwater bassin' then when I throw the big musky baits."

357038,kennyman,2009-06-30 03:56:00,737,"Storm chug bug. Try it. You'll like it. Why ? Because fish eat it up. They go nuts for the gurgle/pop/rattle it makes when you put slack in your line and give it a quick jerk , give it a second or two and pop it again. A quick note .......... when you first cast it, let it sit there for at least five seconds,longer is better, after that a sharp tug, glurp ... and let it sit again. I get most of my hits within the first few pops. Another thing, this is the hardest part, wait a second after the fish hits to set the hook. I've missed a few by instantly reacting. It's hard not to, but you'll hook more fish if yo can just hang on that extra little bit. Heres a pic. Looks like a frog I guess. Works on bass,pike ............ heck I've even caught walleye on it. The hooks they come with are thin and sharp so keep'em that way and watch out when your unhooking them or you'll be on the end of the lure too (been there,done that, got the t-shirt). Lastly have fun, there's nothing better than perfectly calm water just about sunset, everything is silent except the glurp of the topwater, and then BANG, hang on !!! "

At the same time making a very attractive bloop bloop bloop bloop noise.

There is nothing like bringing mule Smallies up out of 15 to 20 fow to smash a popper!  I also like to toss a black/blue skirted buzzbait over weed beds. At night, or in very low light, be sure to give black coloured baits a shot. They silhouette against the night sky and are easier for the Bass to hone in on.  In all cases with topwater baits, a good approach is to cast the bait out as far as you can from the boat, let the circles dissipate, and then start a varied retrieve of twitches, pauses, and erratic movements to simulate a wounded prey. I find they smash it on the pause a lot of the time!! Sometimes ripping as buzzbait over weeds can produce good results. You get a reaction or anger type of strike.  Enjoy!"

The frog will also pick up more gunk without a direct connection.  Most guys I see who fish topwater a lot don't even use split rings, just a direct knot to the eye.
