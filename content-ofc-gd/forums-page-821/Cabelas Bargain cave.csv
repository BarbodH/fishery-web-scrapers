359628,solopaddler,2009-07-08 03:00:00,8605,"I noticed the deals on the XML rods today myself. Also good prices on the XMLTI  rods. Not quite as cheap as you've mentioned, but still very very good prices. Problem is they won't ship the rods surface, only air and shipping is $40. Even with the expensive shipping it's not a bad deal. (I ordered a 71/2' 2PC XML rod rated for 4-10lb test. I needed a new live bait rigging rod for walleye, couldn't resist.  )"
