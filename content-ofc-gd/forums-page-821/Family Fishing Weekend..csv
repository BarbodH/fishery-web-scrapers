359940,Musky or Specks,2009-07-09 01:33:00,2710,I think you would enjoy Sparrow Lake. A variety of species and for the amount of pressure still pretty easy to catch.
359950,icedude,2009-07-09 01:45:00,459,YES Sparrow would be a good choice  unfortunately due to the Toronto Strike the Ontario Family Fishing Weekend GTA events at High Park and Toronto Islands have been CANCELLED  have a look at www.familyfishingweekend.com  Cheers  Paul

Lake Dalrymple is just outside of Orillia (East) and there is a bridge between the Upper and Lower Lakes that you could fish at. Unfortunately, public access is diminishing these days.  There is also a public fishing pier at Couchiching Beach park in Orillia. Could be crowded though.  I believe there are docks at Barrie in Kempenfelt Bay, but not sure if they allow fishing there.  Others will probably know."
359980,GBW,2009-07-09 02:30:00,8460,they are even having an event at Toogoopond in Unionville (HWY 7 and Kennedy area) and it's not far at all.  Lot's of shore spots there too.

Do you suppose I could get some ideas from the local licensing shop? I mean afterall, if I actually catch some fish this year, I might even buy a real licence  Or does anyone on here have suggestions for someone who hasn't fished much in the past 20 years, about good fishing spots around Fort Erie and Port Colborne??"
360022,jediangler,2009-07-09 04:27:00,1923,"Hey barbless, there is a tourney this weekend at Island lake. It's both Saturday & Sunday. You could win $2500 for the biggest bass."
