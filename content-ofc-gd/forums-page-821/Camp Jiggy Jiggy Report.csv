359793,MCTFisher9120,2009-07-08 15:10:00,3761,"Nice job,  MTBF"
359502,TJQ,2009-07-07 20:39:00,7806,"Well after the Lakair G2G, and a few days of work, it was time to take back off to camp for a few nites over the July long weekend.  Camp is finally pretty much set up and except for some cleanup and organizing there's finally no work to do, except the mandatory wood cutting and trail cleaning.  Things were pretty uneventful, a little rainy, and the skeeters were bad only on the first nite, so all in all it was a very relaxing trip with lots of decent fish being caught by everyone.. really I caught a few too??  We did Stop at the MacEwans Gas Station in Latchford and picked up some cheap Lucky Strike spoons which we drug around and did very well on.  Fluorescent Orange works well on the Montreal River, as well as Brass/Red.  The spoons were under $2 each so we picked up the whole card full!!  The guy at that station really helped me out of a trailer bearing bind, so I try to stop in and gas up every chance I get!  The wildlife was out in full form.. didn't get any pictures though, but, this trip we saw 4 different species of ducks, a lynx walking along the shoreline 50 feet from the boat... that was AMAZING, 1 moose and 5 bears, two of them were very small cubs with their mothers..  very very cute!!! (for now)  Here's some pictures and a couple of videos form the trip!      This guy visited with us all week.. hes a bit fatter now than he was...     My serious side    The magic spoon!!    We caught lotsa these..  nice fishery there, fish of all year classes around!     Jaden and Muskie sharing the boat!    NOW FOR THE FISH PICTURES!!              Moniques got this funky cross armed pike vulcan hold she can seem to shake???    Avery Cleaned up with some nice topwater bass!              And of course I always get the biggest one!!!     Anyone know what kind of ducks these are??  they hung around the dock and were quite cute...  they aren't blacks...    Tons of wild flowers on the shoreline as well.       Having a woodsplitter there takes alot of the work outta cordwood!! Runs really well!!    We did have one nice fish fry....  done up with fresh garlic and butter!!  Thanks Mr. Pikie!!    My happy place   We played ""Sorry"" every night.. Avery won most of the time..  I think hes sneaky.. that's what I think!!    Ahh... the sunsets!!        My motto is... ""Happy Wife... Happy Life!!""    Lasagna done on the BBQ!!    Now I cant wait to go back,  Off to Lingham Lake this weekend for a trip with some friends, then back to work for a while then hopefully another extra long weekend very soon!!"

359645,Bob,2009-07-08 03:24:00,370,"Great shots, nice trip.  That's what it's all about.  Hard to tell sometimes with young ducks that don't have adult plumage yet but I'm guessing a brood of young redheads."
359646,Bly,2009-07-08 03:25:00,1556,"Looks like a grand to me was had by all TJ.  The game Sorry is very popular around our house also, Sydney and Amanda win most often though."
