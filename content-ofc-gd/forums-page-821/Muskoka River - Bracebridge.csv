Hopefuly with your guys/gals help I will have one in August.   I am going to be heading up to Bracebridge for a week with the family to hook up with some longtime friends at cottage on the Muskoka river.  Having looked at it on Google, I am wondering if its worthwhile bringing the boat.  I have a 17' Lund so I have some concerns about how navigable the waterway is, water hazards, and where to launch?  It looks more like the type of river you might just be better off in a canoe or a tinner.  I don't mind taking the boat and making a day trip to one of the nearby lakes.  I guess the question would be which one?   Also, does anyone know which species are in the Muskoka River?  I know these things are not shared easily, but if anyone is willing, I would really like give the kids a bit of a day trip adventure to some backwoods type of location with the canoe...I don't have a 4 wheeler though, just my Explorer.  Thanks, and please feel free to pm me."

In my limited experience it's certainly worth fishing, although I haven't been very far upstream of the mouth.  For those more familiar with the river:  Is it pretty navigable between Bay Park and the falls downstream of Spence Lake?  I was looking at putting in my 14' tinney (15 hp motor + electric) at the ramp on Shaw Street and see what it has to offer."
