Every once in a while I get out my old blue glass rod for an outing. It was the very first grown-up fishing rod to call my own and after 40 odd years of abuse it still holds up. It flexes like a whip so it has great casting range for a 5' rod That was one of last year's victims. I also have a few treasures in the tackle box. Old hula poppers, chugbugs, rapala minnows, etc..  I just keep changing the hooks.  Today's weapon of choice was a broken back rebel minnow I've had forever      ( lost it a few times but always managed to get it back). Just twitch it and let it float back up, repeat. Reel and stop, let it float to surface and repeat. That old lure still managed to coax up a couple of snot rockets in the cold front today.  The 2 fellas down from me caught squit.  Sometimes it pays to hold onto them old faves of yesteryear."
359614,Jonny,2009-07-08 02:27:00,1380,"Yep, like we used to say in my gun club, ``It ain`t the gun, it`s the jerk on the trigger`` (Translation - if the gun isn`t shooting straight, it`s probably caused by jerking the trigger.)  We like to delude ourselves that the latest bells and whistles in rod, reel and tackle give us an advantage, when knowing how and where to use the equipment is more important.  I had one of those solid glass rods. I cut it down to make a short jigging rod for ice fishing. Wish I hadn`t done that.  My old Mitchell 301A `modernized`with Power Pro line... it`s caught hundreds of pickerel, pike, specks and bass and is still going strong.... "
359730,bigugli,2009-07-08 12:36:00,6138,I have the old 300A. Finally retired it 5 years back when the bail tanked. It now sits on my wall.
359753,John,2009-07-08 13:30:00,2956,I have an old 6 1/2' Diawa hollow glass rod that I bought 35 years ago that I still like and go to when I feel nostalgic.
359796,johnnyb,2009-07-08 15:22:00,3413,I still feel guilty about tossing my 300A...don't know why on earth I didn't at least keep it for the day I have my own little man-cave with retired fishing gear on the walls.
359821,archie_james_c,2009-07-08 18:07:00,618,Thats impossible...fish can't be caught without using IMX Loomis' or SC VI graphites...same as moose and deer can't be killed without using WSM's and Ultra Mags   .
359827,Fang,2009-07-08 18:23:00,1330,"My old fav's now sit on a shelf right above my chair in the TV room. I pull em down and play a bit when watching TV.  Shimano 10SG - my very first BC bought at Barkleys 1982 Shimano 200 - bought right after my first trip out with the 10SG Mitchel 300 France made - my first real spinning reel from Outdoor Store in Dixie Mall early 70's maybe. I think I was 8 at the time  They sit in with some vintage reels I collect Green cardinals 3 and 4's, Red Abu 5000 with pearl handles, 2 Abu Black 6000's from 60's, Braun Spinning reel and several old pfluegers's"
