Very new to the ""Blue Zone"" (heard of it yesterday) and was hoping to get a little more info.  Here is what I know thus far...  Far out - 250+ for depth. Top of the water colomn - Top 60 fow greens and oranges for colours  I fish out of Port Darlington.  Any info on this matter would be greatly appriciated.  Getting sick of not catching Salmon so want to switch it up a bit and the steelies are such acrobats!  Thanks for your help.  D  And i'll be sure to keep my 5 SilverStreak!  LOL  Kidding."
