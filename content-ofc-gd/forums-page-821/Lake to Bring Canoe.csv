359474,Dan668,2009-07-07 19:41:00,1120,Wondering what lake would you recommend not to far from Mississauga to bring the canoe. Just a day trip. Must be an area to launch and park. Was thinking pigeon river. Any other ideas. Thanks
359485,jediangler,2009-07-07 20:00:00,1923,What species are you looking to fish for? C&R or are you looking for dinner?
359486,Dan668,2009-07-07 20:04:00,1120,open to any species. strictly c & r
359533,jediangler,2009-07-07 21:39:00,1923,"Kelso in Milton. Island lake in Orangeville, but not this weekend unless you're interested in the tourney. Mountsberg off hwy #6 south. Pigeon river is good too. Try putting in across from Emily provincial park."
359538,Dan668,2009-07-07 21:43:00,1120,"No dont want to be in a tourney haha. Ive tried of one those two before. Cant remember which. Is was alright. Lots of weeds. If i did go to pigeon river, i would be launching across from emily.  Id assume the main species in that section would be bass. So id be best to work the shore?"
359559,jediangler,2009-07-07 22:51:00,1923,There should be plenty of weeds in that stretch of the Pigeon river now too. I'd throw spinnerbaits along the edges of lily pad beds and sluggos or moss boss topwater weedless type lures right into the pads. You should find largemouth and possibly a little musky hanging around. Good luck and take lots of pics for your report.

If you're just out for the day don't overlook spots in your backyard, with the strike there's no ferry service out to the islands so I imagine it's pretty quiet out there.  Good bass & pike on the back side of Centre Island & marina.  There's also all the river estuaries that are open to canoes, some good smallie action that's hard to fish out of anything other than a canoe."
