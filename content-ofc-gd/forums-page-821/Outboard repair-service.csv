I am located in Dunnville, but Riverside said that they have a bit of a back log for fixing motors (plus they don't really like doing the older models).  Can anyone recommend someone around the Niagara or Hamilton area?  Thanks!"

Bay City Marine (aka ""we did so and so, but really we didn't"") Dundas Marine Forans Marine  Next time I need serviving I think I will go try Dundas Marine. Seemed like good guys, I bought my trailer off them."
