359713,scubadoo73,2009-07-08 11:30:00,5,"I have about 15 and counting I always get the 3rd degree when discussing this with the wife she always asks why and my answer is always different fish different rods well why do you have 4 for the same kind of fishing (6.5 -7 foot for bass, pike,walleye ect) this was answered last year when I broke a rod in a derby and the spare was right beside me."
359714,juanmorkast,2009-07-08 11:32:00,4,17 but only 3 get reg use the rest are only used about dozen times per yr  but my selective domestic accounting brings that to 4 rods  bob
359717,muddler,2009-07-08 11:36:00,623,100+ All custom built except for 3 loaners. I started to build my own about 40 years ago.  muddler
359718,Whitespinnerbait,2009-07-08 11:37:00,2038,12 and that's not enough...   P.S.  To all the guys who are afraid that their wives read how many rods they own .. Maybe you don't want to know how many pairs of shoes your wives own......
359721,John,2009-07-08 11:55:00,2956," I have a special room too, but I don't necessarily get to keep my gear there.  The quick answer is waaay too many. I probably use 4 maybe 5 regularly throughout the season. Another 15 or so that get inspected with excitement when the grass turns green and then forgotten about as the season(s) progresses. Doesn't include specialty rods.....downrigger, surfcaster, ice rods, float rods, fly rods....damn, I see some activity on the classifieds coming up..  Watch that space!"

359747,craigdritchie,2009-07-08 13:14:00,1586,"Lots of rods, but they all get used now and then. That's the joy in fishing for anything that bites.  Probably 10 to 12 steelhead rods, in lengths from 9 to 15 feet to cover little creeks to giant rivers. About a dozen spinning rods, in various actions from 5 to about 8.5 feet. About a dozen baitcasting rods and flipping sticks, again in various actions from 6 to 8 feet. Maybe 8 or 9 muskie - pike rods, for everything from light bucktails to monster trolling plugs. Couple of downrigger trolling outfits for salmon and greasers. Five fly rods, ranging from a 6-foot 3 weight for creek brookies to a 10 foot 9-weight I sometimes use for pike. Couple of heavier spinning and levelwind outfits for my occasional saltwater trips. Half-dozen really dusty ice fishing rods - they never see the light of day, as I find ice fishing about as appealing as a root canal or a clogged toilet."

Well, when she saw his 50-60 ball caps, she said she would never bug me again about how many I have, which has only been 5!  So, I look forward to applying the same logic to fishing!  I have only 5 rods so far...been fishing for only 8 months (with 3 of those months on the hard water).  Now does it matter that 3 of the rods I haven't even used yet?  Is there some rule that says I can't get another rod before I've even tried the ones I already have? I think NOT!"

360038,Rich Clemens,2009-07-09 10:17:00,3131,Somewhere in the neighborhood of 20 - but some have been retired.  The old days of 6 footers for larger game have been retired for 7 footers.    Different rods set up for different species.  Grab and go.

Ok now how many rods does everyone own that they use on a regular basis....i do use each and everyone of mine  15 is my answer for now   PS if anyone has any cool plans for a custom rod holder to accomadate 15 i would love to see it  I can always build two to keep the wife puzzled
