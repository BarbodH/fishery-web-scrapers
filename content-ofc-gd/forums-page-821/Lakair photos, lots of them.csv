I didin't realize Sam was getting that much air coming of the dock......That was his first time dock jumping ever as well as his first time up north and in a boat.....I think he's going to make a great partner....It was sad when we got home after that weekend..He spent two days under the bed pouting... Poor fella:( Not to worry Sam, there will be another day for dock jumping......."
