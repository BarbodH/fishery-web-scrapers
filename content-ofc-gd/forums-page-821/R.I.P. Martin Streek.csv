359451,Joey,2009-07-07 19:12:00,9122,102.1 The Edge was a better place with you there.  RIP Martin Streek.
359453,NAW,2009-07-07 19:15:00,4022,It's a sad day for the Edge.  Too bad to here.
359557,DRIFTER_016,2009-07-07 22:49:00,10439,"Dang, Marty's dead!! I've known him for 20 years. Wha' Happen?  R.I.P. Marty, I'll miss ya bro."
359562,wallacio,2009-07-07 23:04:00,475," Unfortunately, reports are that he took his own life.   Definitely a great loss."
359592,darsky,2009-07-08 01:53:00,586,My teenage years were intertwined with CFNY. All the roadshows. Anyone remember Sunday nights at RPM with Chris Sheppard? Oh the memories..............and the girlies!!
359637,tambo,2009-07-08 03:14:00,85,"Wow, I usually don't care when celeb types die, but alt rock was such a big part of my life in high school and early adulthood, and Martin Streek's voice has been imprinted into my mind because of it.  Never met the guy, but this is like losing a piece of my youth.  RIP brother"
359641,DRIFTER_016,2009-07-08 03:18:00,10439," Yep, I was running the lights. Don't forget the Live Earl Jive and Beverly Hills Friday night gig."
359671,ColdH20guy,2009-07-08 04:20:00,312,"RIP MS! Great station, listen to it exclusively especially the morning show!!"
359675,MuskyBill,2009-07-08 04:38:00,311,"Yup, many Saturday nights spent either AT the Phoenix or listening to it. Martin brought a LOT of great music to the table, that you wouldn't necessarily hear anywhere else.  Sad that it came to this end."
359814,lucabrasi,2009-07-08 17:40:00,114," Remember? Who can forget!  That's too bad about Martin. He was definitely an alt rock icon in this city. I don't listen to it that much anymore, but CFNY was a great station in it's day.  A lot of programming innovations that a lot of other stations are copying now. I especially like(d)  Allan Cross's ""History of New Rock""."
359843,Joey,2009-07-08 19:13:00,9122,"  rbell, fyi, you can buy Alan's Cross' History of rock cd at any music store.  I bought one for Paul for Christmas.  Not sure how many there are at this point, but the first installation came out late last year.  Joey"
359897,lucabrasi,2009-07-08 23:32:00,114, Good to know! Thanks Joey!
359936,Rizzo,2009-07-09 01:27:00,4754,"wow this is a blast from the past. Roadshows at highschool dances, Ontario Place held them for a summer or two as well I think. Unfortunate news. Not sure if there is anything comparable today to what CFNY did through the 80's...not to mention they would play my beloved RAMONES"
359984,DRIFTER_016,2009-07-09 02:43:00,10439,"  And the Pistols, Talking Heads, NewYork Dolls, Teenage Head, B52's, Iggy................................................"
