767369,Roy,2013-02-12 23:22:00,13728,"Thanks for that, Rob."
767384,kickingfrog,2013-02-13 00:05:00,8333,My understanding is that they update the data every 2 years and 2013 is an update year.
767388,Rod Caster,2013-02-13 00:18:00,5784,Great resource. There is some information on that map that isn't found on FishOnline... who knew I could target Round Whitefish near North Bay?
767392,spincast,2013-02-13 00:31:00,3279,does anyone really eat freshwater Drum?  4 a month..... cool link
767393,Muskieman,2013-02-13 00:33:00,2472,Drum = Good stuff !  but 4 a month ?
767398,ketchenany,2013-02-13 00:40:00,3229,"I produced the printed version for two editions. I went through a lot of information; a huge project to do, it takes two months.  Glad to see it again. It gets bounced around different suppliers.  Thanks for posting."
767401,spincast,2013-02-13 00:44:00,3279,"OK, can't say I ever thought of eating one - but there ya go - and 4 is the healthy limit for the water body I was loooking at."
767411,kemper,2013-02-13 01:04:00,2232,Apparently they aren't half bad...I saw apparently because I've never actually worked up the courage to try one.  Similar to eating a carp I'd imagine.
767418,kickingfrog,2013-02-13 01:13:00,8333,I've had drum from Nipissing during the spring. Nothing wrong with it.
767421,Muskieman,2013-02-13 01:17:00,2472,Yep.
767432,kemper,2013-02-13 01:34:00,2232,It's the Lake Ontario version that I'm leery of
767433,kickingfrog,2013-02-13 01:41:00,8333,Two different issues.  1. The stigma associated with eating drum.  2. The stigma associated with eating fish from a particular lake.  I also mentioned the time of year because some fish from some bodies of water tend to taste different depending on the season.
767447,kemper,2013-02-13 02:06:00,2232," I've found fish from cold water seem to taste better almost all the time.  I also enjoy the odd (very odd) great lakes trout without issue, tastes fantastic if it's the right size.  I imagine if someone served up a plate of drum I wouldn't turn it down, but I don't think I'd go through the work of catching/cleaning/cooking for a fish that I've heard tastes fairly bland."
767453,kickingfrog,2013-02-13 02:16:00,8333,"For me, drum are bycatch during spring walleye fishing. They sure help make the walleye fillets go farther."
767616,Ron,2013-02-13 22:09:00,1683,"Try it and let us know how it works out for ya.  Cheers, Ron...."
