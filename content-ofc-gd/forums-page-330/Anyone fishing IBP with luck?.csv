I've been thinking about IBP but haven't heard or read much about anyone having any success. Anyone here with any info? If you want to keep it quiet, that's okay,  you can send me a PM too.  Other than Simcoe, I've not tried anywhere else for whitefish, is there any other body of water I should be considering? I've heard of GB but not even sure where to begin there.  Thanks, Stan"
766915,BillM,2013-02-11 17:04:00,17367,"Whitefish have been tight lipped on Simcoe this year..   Goodluck, it will probably take a lot of running around to find an active school of fish."
766940,Oggie,2013-02-11 18:53:00,588,"Bill, Glad to hear it's not just me ! I've been out twice for whitefish at IBP and no luck. I'm a newbie at whitefish so don't read into my lack of success. Dan O."
766956,davey buoy,2013-02-11 19:56:00,5505,You'll probably have to do a lot of experimenting People don't often give up these areas. Good luck!!!!!
766961,Terry,2013-02-11 19:59:00,14456,I fished all my whitie spots out from IBP and every spot produced    perch that is  perch in every spot whitefish  0/0
766970,wuchikubo,2013-02-11 20:25:00,1114,"No whities but you've got some nice lakers, the lake trout on simcoe don't like me so I'm going to try so see if the whities will co-operate. Doesn't sound very positive at the moment.  It's east-side versus the west-side toss up right now for me. Either case, it's a significant walk in deep slushy snow unless it hardens up tonight.  Stan"
766972,wuchikubo,2013-02-11 20:27:00,1114,I wasn't looking for other's personal spots just some indication that there are some active whitefish to target. I do understand all of the secrecy though.
766973,davey buoy,2013-02-11 20:30:00,5505,"There's been a few caught,but not the best year so far from what I've seen and heard. I'm still trying to get my first in 10 years lol."
766977,misfish,2013-02-11 20:32:00,29133,"Stan has friends here that will share with him,via PM. Stans the man.LOL   Have a great day out there Stan. Catch a whitie,and show Terry how it,s done.LOL BTW,I havent gotten one yet this year as well."
766981,davey buoy,2013-02-11 20:35:00,5505,I'm sure that will change as well to
766996,DoubleDigits,2013-02-11 20:56:00,140,Haven't been out of IPB yet but I found this one at BBP a few weeks back.

767259,LeXXington,2013-02-12 15:15:00,1928,"I have been out twice of IBP and only hooked up once. Very slow so far.  Yes, and lots of perch."
