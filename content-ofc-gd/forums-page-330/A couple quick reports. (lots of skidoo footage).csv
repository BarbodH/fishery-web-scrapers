First off went across Wabigoon to Thunder Lake for trout, then Thunder lake to Dore Lake for walleye.   Managed to get a small trout and a a couple of walleye and some cool footage of my journeys to and from the lakes.   Trout and walleye were finnicky that day......lots on screen.....just not lots of takers.                                     I headed out again today after another buddy pulled out from some renos we had planned......oh well. gave me time to build a snow fort with Jack and mess around in the snow before heading out to get a couple of hours in before supper.   Bite was almost non existent, but i had the whole lake to myself and it was just great being out.   I did forget my sign....AGAIN.......got inventive....lol.         SNOW FORTS ARE FUN                                                               ONLY GOT A SMALL PIKE TODAY........BUT THE SOLITUDE WAS AWESOME!              BEST TOURNEY SIGN EVER!  "
