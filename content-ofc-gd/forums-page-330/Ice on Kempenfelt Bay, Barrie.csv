765259,Beanstir,2013-02-04 23:18:00,11,"How is the ice on Kemenfelt Bay? We are attending a fishing tournament on Feb 16. Last year the ice conditions were poor and the tournament was cancelled. With a prize table worth $50,000 we are hopeful to at least catch a fish. Lets hope there is lots of ice this year. http://www.simcoehomebuilders.com/news-events/ice-fishing-tournament-2013.php"
765264,davey buoy,2013-02-04 23:28:00,5505,"About 4"" in about 60' of water today .Should be a lot better by then I would hope"
765266,Joeytier,2013-02-04 23:34:00,3990,At least 2 people went through this weekend [don't know where on Kempenfelt exactly].
765310,registerfly,2013-02-05 01:24:00,198,"we had 6"" in 110fow"
765313,BillM,2013-02-05 01:27:00,17367,"About 6in where I was tonight as well, good black ice.    Guys ripping around all over the bay on snow machines as well."
765365,ckrb2007,2013-02-05 04:39:00,449,"I was out all weekend on my ATV. Never found anything less then 6"" of soild black ice. My guess is the two guys that went through, probably went through skimmed over pressure cracks. I was 4kms out off of BBP today, and the ice is even better out there.....pushing 8"" of amazing ice."
765417,Beanstir,2013-02-05 14:50:00,11,Anyone know the depth of water the tournament area is in?

765897,Beanstir,2013-02-07 02:50:00,11,Looks like we have enough ice for the tourny. Not sure of my strategy for success. Deep water? Shallow? Where will the fish be at 12 noon? We will be checking our hole early with a fish finder. But that will be at 8:30am. I am sure the fish will go deeper but how deep? Should be a fun day. At least we get a breakfast and lunch out of it.

766130,Beanstir,2013-02-08 02:21:00,11,I wonder what day they start to drill the holes? Long range forecaste looks good for making ice. Monday warms up to 7 degrees with a little rain but outside of that should be makin ice.
767727,Beanstir,2013-02-14 04:21:00,11,"Getting close to the Tourny on Saturday. Going to be cold but only 3 hours to catch a fish to get in on the $50,000 in prizes"
