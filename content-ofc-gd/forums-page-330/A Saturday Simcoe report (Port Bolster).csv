Road conditions were less than favorable on the way up with multiple spinouts and crashes all over the 401. We used the same outfitter as last time, but it did'nt run as smoothly. All his equipment had sucome to the snow (2 Argos and a bombider), outta his control I guess and it didnt get us down. We had to wait around a little bit, but finally made our way out. I was hoping to land some keepers agin, but it wouldnt happen this go around. The fishing was slow and the perch have seemed to have moved off onto other places. We managed about 10 perch each and 2 hearing each. Oh well cant win them all the time, but its better than the best day at work. MNR was out bombing around again keepin things in check. Onto a few pics.  "

Don't know what depth that Casey's has their huts at right now, but 15-18 feet of water off Bolster seems to be pretty good right now.  I think early season he had his huts out around 20-22 feet.  Thanks for taking the time  Cheers  Craig"

766839,pics,2013-02-11 02:16:00,1268,fishing a hut with such big holes would make me nervous.....lol
766851,pidge,2013-02-11 03:17:00,438,"Sandbag: yeah seemed to be around the 25' mark maybe. They defiantly wernt biting like two weeks ago up there. Chris: thy shall eat thy catch...except Cisco and Muskie, other rules and common sense stuff like pick up your trash. Pics: yeah no kidding. These two times up there this year at Casey's is the only time I've seen the floor carved open that much. It dosent leave a lot of room for error. Lol."

767024,misfish,2013-02-11 22:05:00,29133," Those big open holes (what ever you want to call them)  Made for great watching of fish swimming around,or watching a big trout or whitie coming up. Big bubbles before you even seen that laker . All the huts I ever made,had a 3x4 chainsaw cut holes. None of that drilled stuff. My boys learned fast,to sit and watch. Schools of herring and smelts was a blast I even made them wear a PFD,just in case when they were wee lads.That was moms number one rule.LOL"
