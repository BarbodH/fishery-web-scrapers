767596,iFish4real,2013-02-13 20:46:00,386,well then...get an iPhone
767597,BillM,2013-02-13 20:47:00,17367, LOL! I can be like Rose in Titanic standing in the front of the boat while my oldman drives  :)
767609,BillM,2013-02-13 21:41:00,17367, Now that is pretty cool.
767295,bassmaster4,2013-02-12 17:54:00,801,"Hey guys, I'm looking to buy a Lowrance sonar unit, It comes with Navionics but it only covers the Great Lakes, Simcoe etc. I do a fair amount of fishing on smaller northern lakes around the Gowganda area and was just wondering if they would have a chip or whatever it is that i could buy that would have some of those lakes before i buy anything. Thanks bassmaster4"
767299,Roy,2013-02-12 18:06:00,13728,You'd have to buy that separately. Go to Navionics...go to Hot Maps then check Canada...it'll show the list a thousands of maps for Canadian lakes by Province.
767303,BillM,2013-02-12 18:22:00,17367,"The odds are very good those lakes won't be covered.  Like Roy said, make sure you check out the lake list before buying the chip."
767305,kickingfrog,2013-02-12 18:24:00,8333,"Ya, what Roy said, but double check the lakes because a lot of smaller and more remote lakes are not on any chip."
767306,kickingfrog,2013-02-12 18:25:00,8333,... And billm types faster them me.
767308,BillM,2013-02-12 18:28:00,17367,I WIN I WIN!!   LOL
767309,kickingfrog,2013-02-12 18:33:00,8333,"Now I was on my phone at the time, put me infront of a real keyboard and I can two finger poke with the rest of them."
767310,bassmaster4,2013-02-12 18:34:00,801,"cool, thanks for the help guys"
767311,BillM,2013-02-12 18:36:00,17367," Challenge accepted, lol"
767329,iFish4real,2013-02-12 20:54:00,386,"yeah, pretty much nothing covered north of Temagami..."
767331,Tayzak15,2013-02-12 20:59:00,318,Even if those chips don't work north of temagami. If I bought a fishfinder/gps combo would the gps work at all north of temagami? Like would there be outlines for the lakes and stuff at least or would I just see a plain white page on the gps with my boat in the middle of it?
767333,jedimaster,2013-02-12 21:04:00,3472,"Yah you would essentially see a blank screen and your dotted line. One thing you can do is look at some other option, like Garmin. They have different coverage and me be better for the lakes you fish."
767336,kickingfrog,2013-02-12 21:20:00,8333,"I just tried on my phone's navioincs app and most of the smaller lakes north of Temagami ""disappeared"" as I zoomed in. So as mentioned you might just have your boats path marked on a blank screen."
767440,BillM,2013-02-13 01:51:00,17367,"Yup, just a blank page..  but the tracks + waypoints you make are the important parts anyhow.."
767445,Steve Piggott,2013-02-13 02:04:00,196,I think if you use topo canada card you would get the conture lines for the land  around the lake  and the shape of the lake.
767456,BillM,2013-02-13 02:28:00,17367,Loading Garmin Topos on my Humminbird would be sweet!
767463,Tayzak15,2013-02-13 02:56:00,318,would a garmin gps cover northern ontario? I already have a down imaging fishfinder in mind so I would just buy a seperate garmin gps only unit for plotting.
767468,BillM,2013-02-13 03:24:00,17367, What do you mean 'cover northern Ontario'??   It all depends on the maps you get.  The Ontario topo covers the entire province.
767473,finja,2013-02-13 04:00:00,17,"I have the Navionics Gold maps on my Lowrance and I did fish a lake up near Gowganda last year.  As others have said, I just got a blank screen, not even contour lines for the land.  One thing I wasn't expecting was that the new tracks I was creating every day seemed to shift a bit every day even though I travelled through the same channel."
767475,Tayzak15,2013-02-13 04:05:00,318,"See thats what I was wondering, even if I bought a seperate garming gps unit would it just give me a blank page in the north or would it at least give me lines for a lakes shorelines"
767483,BillM,2013-02-13 04:52:00,17367," The unit doesn't matter, the map does..  If you had a garmin GPS loaded with a topo map for example, you'd get all the land elevations and the outlines of the lakes.."
767511,Steve Piggott,2013-02-13 13:47:00,196,"Ive a garmin 60c with topo on it use it on Nipigon .Shows all the islands and contour lines .use the same unit on my ATV ,boat and truck . Just buy a ram mount"
767577,iFish4real,2013-02-13 17:47:00,386,Well I tried Navionics on my iPhone and it will show the satellite view map as Google maps except no depths for the lake. I used it like this last year on lake Wicksteed which isn't mapped for depths but we could still know where we were and track our way. It's kinda awsome cause I use it as a GPS for hunting too... I'm thinking it would work the same on the boat Navionics...
767589,BillM,2013-02-13 19:42:00,17367, Boat chartplotter/sonar doesn't have a data connection to DL satellite imagery.
767591,ecmilley,2013-02-13 20:13:00,2163,"my hds-8 has google earth images built itno the platinum chip and hot map chips i have,  i would guess that it gets updated when you update your nav chips"
