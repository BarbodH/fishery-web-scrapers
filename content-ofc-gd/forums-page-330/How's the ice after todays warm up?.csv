767070,hotsky,2013-02-11 23:54:00,400,"I have a day off tomorrow and deciding what to do. I'd like to go ice fishing but unsure how Fridays snow and todays warm weather effected the ice conditions? I was at a place last Tue where ice was 8"" would it still be safe tomorrow?"
767076,BillM,2013-02-12 00:09:00,17367,"The ice itself will be just fine, might be sloppy on the top though."
767083,hotsky,2013-02-12 00:25:00,400,btw there was at least +5 today here. hope it didn't do too much danage...
767199,John Bacon,2013-02-12 03:27:00,3277,"I suspect that the 8"" from last week is still there; maybe even thicker.  I don't think todays warm whether would have had too much impact on the ice... it needs to melt the snow first before the ice underneeth melts.  That is not going to happen based on the forecast for the next week."
