765953,azebra,2013-02-07 14:12:00,168,"Hello and good morning all you OFNers! I hope everyone is doing well this winter. Well Im starting this topic because I think I need a little advice on buying a spey reel, Ive decided to jump rite into spey fishing and skip that switch rod thingie..So, in about a weeks time I'll have a grey's G series spey rod, and Im only getting it because of the price, its cheap! I'll be getting it in 13' #8  and havent the slightest clue as to what reel would match that with out spending much more then $150. is that possible? I like the greys gx500 but is that a single hand only reel? Im so lost and advice as to witch reel I should be looking into would rock!  or, if any of you know someone selling a used one... please help me! Im just starting out spey fishing Iv been fly fishing for years so I have that down... and I am on a budget.. like a college budget without a student loan in the bank.. thanks in advance! you all are awesome!  Any reviews here about the Echo Ion?"
765994,cuzza,2013-02-07 17:22:00,467,"I have an Ion - the largest size (10/12). In hindsight i should have gone with the smaller one (8/10) as the biggie isn't full with 250m of GSB, running line and a 540 Compact Skagit head, it does balance nicely though. It seems decent enough, sorry to say i haven't really tested on anything big yet  Have you bought the Greys rod yet? If not, and you're on a budget, look at used gear somewhere like Speypages - lots of good stuff crops up regularly- the Echo rods are supposedly pretty good and show up quite a bit on there. For lines, go with a Skagit setup, easier to learn with - most of the manufacturers have recommended lines for a given rod (this is the Airflo one for example http://www.rajeffsports.com/spey_chart.pdf) - just go with what's in the table"
766000,wallacio,2013-02-07 17:52:00,475,Allen reels are an amazing bargain.   They are blowing out the Alpha II's and the new Alpha III's are in your price range.  http://www.allenflyfishing.com/reels/
766019,kemper,2013-02-07 19:57:00,2232,"You don't have to go all out and buy a ""spey"" reel, all you need to do is make sure the reel has a solid drag and the capacity to hold the large diameter line.  Are you going to be running a Skagit, Scandi, or traditional setup?"
766020,porkpie,2013-02-07 19:58:00,2521,"Buy yourself a float rod and reel instead, and spend time catching fish instead of worrying if the other anglers will rotate the pool with you..... They won't!"
766021,kemper,2013-02-07 20:03:00,2232," Not always about catching a boatload, I switched over to skagit last fall and had an absolute blast while catching far fewer fish... I still get they float rod out as often as I can, but if it's a trip to nice spey water that's the rod I'm bringing."
766023,kemper,2013-02-07 20:10:00,2232,"On my 6wt Skagit rod I run a 9/10 Hardy Uniqua, fantastic little reel.  This picture is the reel on my 9wt - the Hardy holds my 625 grain skagit head as well...   Have fun, and watch out for early season chinnies....they're angry  "
766038,porkpie,2013-02-07 21:12:00,2521,"I have been a steelheader for over 25 years.  I went through a fly rod evolution..... It sucks!  And it's much harder to catch fish!!  It does make you feel good for a bit, even makes you feel more ""evolved"" than the average angler.... Didn't take me long to realize that it's an inefficient way to catch fish, and that I was no more evolved than the average bait fisherman, cept my nose was slightly higher in the air.  I have nothing against guys who want to do it, so long as they have no expectation that I will move so they can ""rotate through"" a hole.  If they want to sit on a rock and smoke cigars and drink from a flask while I pound fish, and they comment on how barbaric my methods are... That's ok with me though!!"
766051,bare foot wader,2013-02-07 22:08:00,1354," sounds like maybe somebody didn't catch many fish on the swing   LOL  plenty of pinners complain about being low holed by other pinners   I've fished an Ion, it's a good reel, good value, echo has a good warranty system...i've heard about those Allen reels, they sound like a sweet deal  any large reel will do with a half decent drag...don't need to bust the bank on...the hipwader forum has a 99% ON membership with a lot of GTA folks, might score a local deal if you check the classifieds there"

767522,azebra,2013-02-13 14:16:00,168,Thanks for the info everyone! I like the Allen and the Ion now.. just gotta flip a quarter
767556,torco,2013-02-13 16:56:00,656,I have the Ion bought it last fall...Unfortunately only had it out on one trip but it handled some hard fighting salmon up in Thunder Bay just fine. Its 8/10 and it suits my 7 w switch rod just fine. Am currently running a skagit head 500 grains.  I really like swinging flies but don't get a lot of time unfortunately. Anyways I don't think you can beat the price on the Ion.
767613,azebra,2013-02-13 22:01:00,168,Iv got a kingpin and a raven thanks with the 14 footers to match thanks
767615,azebra,2013-02-13 22:08:00,168,"and I actually started centerpinning years before I ever flyfished, so I usually fish weekdays, and if i am swinging flies I can and dont mind fishing alone with no one in the run/poos, and the great thing about skagit style spey fishing is.. i can use my sink tips or sone shot, and dead dripe or fish behind a rock without bugging the others,,its not always about the 'swing' but thanks"
