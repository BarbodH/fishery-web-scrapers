766888,msp,2013-02-11 14:20:00,1336,Well done Steve !
766901,BillM,2013-02-11 15:34:00,17367,"Nice Steve!  I thought anyone walking out on Sat was insane, lol!"
766903,kemper,2013-02-11 15:42:00,2232,"I thought about hiking out, then I remembered the snow and decided not to.  Good on ya, looks like I missed out!"
766911,Oggie,2013-02-11 16:50:00,588,We walked out Sunday and it was challenging!  I don't know why but I assumed you had a sled or an ATV. I have new found respect for your success! Your one of us WALKERS! Dan O.
766925,woodro,2013-02-11 17:38:00,168,Walking was definitely tough Saturday and Sunday. A pair of snowshoes made it a bit easier for me. Unfortunately the juice wasnt worth the squeeze. Had a bunch of followers but no takers. Congrats on the successful day! What colour swammers were they hitting?
766932,asdve23rveavwa,2013-02-11 18:25:00,2690,"Nicely done, Steve.  I would have passed out after about 100 yards"
767223,Moosebunk,2013-02-12 08:00:00,3970,Fine lakers for your big effort Steve.
767334,captpierre,2013-02-12 21:07:00,2521,Healthy looking Lakers.  Must be lots of bait.  Yet the Whities are AWOL for the most part.  What gives?
