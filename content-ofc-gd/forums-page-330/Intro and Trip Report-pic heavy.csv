766501,Tim Mills,2013-02-09 18:51:00,476,"Having somewhat figured out how to  insert photo's I thought I would attempt to introduce myself.  I came across this site by accident when searching google images for a portage cart/dolly.  Its impressive how the members of this site are so supportive to one another.  Some others places I enjoy fishing and fly fishing include Mountsburg CA, upper and lower Credit, bronte ck, 1000 Islands around Gan, Crotch Lake, Massassauga PP, and the Niagara River Glen/Whirlpool.  Below are some pics (posted ass backwards) from a short solo canoe trip to the Port Loring area last August- Thanks to JohnnyB and Cliff L for they're previous posts on this area.   I didnt notice this dolly on the way in but it was a very welcome site on the portage out.    on the way out passing the fishing camp    Freeloader      Last fish of the trip-caught most SM trolling blue rapalas.    view from camp   Best SM of the trip. The SM is this area hit and fought hard.     This lakes had a good mix of LM and SM.  I stayed at one campsite-more fishing time less packing and unpacking.   "

766660,Rich,2013-02-10 11:20:00,3927,"Haha, trying to put my dog in a canoe full of gear that picture would be a pic of a tipped canoe and a lotta wet gear!  Welcome to the site and thanks for the report."
766750,Tim Mills,2013-02-10 19:12:00,476, Goldwater is almost 9. He s better in the canoe than the house. Likes to take food from the fridge and stash it around the place or bury it in the back yard.  Sometimes he even closes the fridge door when he is done.
766754,misfish,2013-02-10 19:34:00,29133,They want to be outside.LOL  Had a GSP .female called Winnie(short for Winchester)  Thats all I got to say about her.  Again WELCOME.
766880,Rod Caster,2013-02-11 12:45:00,5784,Welcome! Great trip and I hope to read about more of then like that.
766890,Jds63,2013-02-11 14:28:00,1365,welcome aboard ... that portage looks familiar is that off the Pickeral river ? if so did that same trip many years ago ... we stayed on an island and had the lodges float plane buzz overhead every day
766893,torco,2013-02-11 14:35:00,656,"Welcome, great report. That is one of my favorite spots but I haven't been in a few years, glad to see it still looks nice and clean and the fishing is as I remember it. We have found fishing the small channel that connects the two lakes in the evening to be dynamite. Can easily hook and catch 20 fish in an evening and usually some big ones as well."
766896,NAW,2013-02-11 15:07:00,4022,"Welcome aboard man!  We have the exact same canoe.  But I see you have added a wooden yoke for portaging, and a few other extras.  How is it doing a single portage with that aftermarket yoke?  I just put the stock aluminum cross support my shoulders and giver..  But it's not very comfortable at all."
766914,4x4bassin,2013-02-11 17:04:00,1025,"Thanks for the report , I have been wanting to try that area (Loring) for years but just havn't been able to squeeze a trip in . If I go I will message you for some tips ! O ya welcome aboard very good group here and yes we like dogs ."
