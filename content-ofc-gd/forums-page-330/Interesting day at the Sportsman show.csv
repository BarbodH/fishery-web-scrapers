The alarm went on for a couple of minutes, and then a completely confusing message that said something like 'the report has been investigated and the emergency is good, please exit the building through the nearest exit'. Half hour like we got in, grabbed our deeply discounted gear, and got out.  Anyway, good show I thought. Don't know what it was like on Friday/Saturday but my sense was that it was too snowy for many people to get down there so Sunday seemed very busy. I've been going since I was very young and I'm 27 now so I've seen it change over the years. The hunting/shooting section was a bit cramped and I don't think they do the big art exhibition, combined with the fact that the dog show/exhibitions are now tiny made some sections a bit crowded. The seating at the dog show is minimal (like little league bleachers for 40 people on each side of a small rectangular area."
