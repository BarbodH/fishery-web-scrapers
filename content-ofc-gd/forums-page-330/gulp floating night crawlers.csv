767439,tomO,2013-02-13 01:48:00,363,Any one ever try them with a worm harness? Thx.
767443,kickingfrog,2013-02-13 02:00:00,8333,With smaller blades and or slower speeds but thats really only because I had them. Not sure if other plastic worms sink that much anyway.
767493,Rich,2013-02-13 11:04:00,3927,I have ... Not quite as good as a real crawler but it works.
767496,Terry,2013-02-13 11:19:00,14456,"I have used them  the have a time and  place some days they work well and other days they do not  on days that they do as well as real worms I use them as the perch and other pan fish do not peck them to death, so your not checking your bait as much...."
767504,tomO,2013-02-13 13:16:00,363,"K thx. you guys, think I'll stick to real worms."
767573,kickingfrog,2013-02-13 17:33:00,8333,I thought we were comparing regular plastics to floating. I haven't bothered with real worms in years. No issues with my catch rate.
767576,mike rousseau,2013-02-13 17:39:00,4661,"I've tried em... They're ok... And might help if your fishing really snaggy areas.... But not needed in most cases.... They are also stiffer then the normal gulp so movement is effected negatively....  But 3"" gulp minnows work better...  I haven't put a real worm on a harness in years... And we did the Pepsi challenge... Tested worms and gulp side by side... They performed equally... But less trouble with gulp.... No messy soil or worm guts to deal with....    ..."
767606,captpierre,2013-02-13 21:23:00,2521,The walleye pro Hatch recommended them (Berkley sponser) at the Sportsman Show  He said they are hollow so they float and  their heads are angled to make them rotate slowly in a harness
767614,tomO,2013-02-13 22:02:00,363,"I jigged 3 inch gulp minnows off and on last year and never got a hit. Even when i was catching fish on real minnows I would put one on, no luck."
767617,Rich,2013-02-13 22:15:00,3927,"Gulp minnows catch fish like crazy, of all sizes. I've never been able to go to the CTC rack and pick up a more reliable bait for lots of bites for almost any species. Panfish, crappies, bass, pike, steelhead, even caught carp on em.  The Gulp nightcrawlers worked OK for me. I bought the floating ones specifically for harness fishing... In this case, nothing beats live."
767667,Ralph Field,2013-02-14 01:34:00,1018,"On a ""slow death "" hook they seem to work better than on other styles of hooks."
767676,moxie,2013-02-14 01:53:00,1566,X2. Always have 2-3 bags on hand. They are a great go to bait for me when fishing is slow. Crawlers not so much
