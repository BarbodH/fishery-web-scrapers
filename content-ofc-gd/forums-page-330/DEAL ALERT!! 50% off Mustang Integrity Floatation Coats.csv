766031,SlowPoke,2013-02-07 20:42:00,2984,Sail - Vaughn Small to XXXL still available No HST either
766032,moxie,2013-02-07 20:47:00,1566,Good deal but it doesn't mitigate how much of a Rip Off everything is.
766042,Fisherman,2013-02-07 21:36:00,7201,"I dunno but somethings not right, the picture they show is a jacket not the longer MC1525 coat.  Maybe a switch and bait."
766050,SlowPoke,2013-02-07 22:01:00,2984,Tried one on and its pretty long. Its definitely not a bomber length.
766054,SlowPoke,2013-02-07 22:12:00,2984,This is the coat http://www.mustangsurvival.com/recreational/mc1525?division=recreation&country=23
766058,registerfly,2013-02-07 22:19:00,198,thanks OP might be worth looking into
766068,Roy,2013-02-07 22:47:00,13728,That would be a bait and switch. A switch and bait would be ok.
766072,iFish4real,2013-02-07 23:13:00,386,"checked the web site, nothing listed on sale there..."
766074,Fisherman,2013-02-07 23:14:00,7201,"Okay, then it's a good deal, when I looked at their website it showed the short model.  I guess I'll have to switch the bait.."
766177,buick14,2013-02-08 12:39:00,741,"The deal is prob only on for today, but the store is closed due to the weather conditions ....online orders not accepted Lolololololol"
766180,BITEME,2013-02-08 13:10:00,1968,keep in mind that a jacket does not necessarily mean that its approved alot of times 2 piece systems need both parts worn together to meet the standard.  Peter
766421,jjcanoe,2013-02-09 02:18:00,744,"wow, is everyone this negative all the time?"
766499,musky_hunter,2013-02-09 18:22:00,328,"No go for the longer survival suit. The price is on sale at 199.99, regular $280. The bibs are regular price at 299"
766775,registerfly,2013-02-10 21:06:00,198,"so just got back from checking this jacket out.  It is a fantastic price and if it's HST included even better. Still on sale as of today. It's rated buoyancy for a MED is 132-195lbs. and it is definitely not a short jacket, but not 3/4 long either, good in between length suitable for lots of getting up and down whilst ice fishing. Besides, you wouldn't want it to be longer especially if you want to pair it with a bib pant.  For those that think they are an expensive store which, is another discussion all together, then don't shop there. (I personally don't know how they can survive with such a high sq footage and 4 brand new stores in 12 months) It's their business model so they can do whatever they like. OR do what smart shoppers do and buy what you want when they are on sale like I do. 40-50% off on certain clothing items since last fall."
767525,zenon11,2013-02-13 14:34:00,75,"I went in to Sail yesterday and both the shorter jacket and longer floater coat are now $129 plus tax. They also have a lot of their ice fishing suits on sale. I picked up the black frabill suit for $210, down from $399"
