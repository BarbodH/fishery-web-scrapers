766717,flyfisherguy,2013-02-10 17:00:00,3,"Hi  I am looking for building plans to assemble a floating dock, using blue barrels for floatation.  I want to find a complete plan so that I can know how many barrels I would need. Ideally, I'd like to have the deck of the dock to be about 12""-16"" from the water surface. I would like the size of the dock to be at least 8'x16'. Also, does anyone know of a cheap source for metal hinges and dock hardware?  Thanks  flyfisherguy"

Use seatbelt webbing, or cable, and run it around a support.. and then around each barrel at the narrow points at top and bottom.. then over a support.. then over the next barrel.. etc. That way you can roll the dock in and out of the water simply by leaving the straps/cables just slightly loose. This allows the barrels to roll, but still be retained."

Im thinking 2x8'x8' sections connected should be big enpough to hold many people!"
