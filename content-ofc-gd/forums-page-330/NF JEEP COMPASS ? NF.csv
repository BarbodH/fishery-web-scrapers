766688,ketchenany,2013-02-10 15:47:00,3229,"Friday I got stuck in a parking lot at work and on our street. Had a difficult time freeing the car out of the snow . . . Drove yesterday and all seemed well. This morning at 60 km I felt a little shake nothing serious probably the ice and snow patches on the road.  I took it on the 400 and when I hit 70 and 80 this thing started to shake like crazy, took it back below 70 and all went quiet!  Did I do in the ball joints trying to get out of the snow? It' not a 4x4. The steering is fine."
766689,DRIFTER_016,2013-02-10 15:49:00,10439,"NAH, you just got a bunch of snow and ice build up on the back side of your rims. Because of this your wheels are out of balance. Clean the crud out and all will be good."
766690,Roy,2013-02-10 15:50:00,13728,Universal joint maybe. ?  edit: Yeah Dave's suggestion sounds good too.
766691,GBW,2013-02-10 15:51:00,8460,My subaru is doing the same thing because I had to drive through a 3 and 1/2' bank from the snow plow.  It just needs some time (well for mine) to defrost and get the snow to melt where it shouldn't be.
766694,jjcanoe,2013-02-10 15:55:00,744,what Drifter said!
766696,BillM,2013-02-10 16:02:00,17367,Snow/ice build up for sure...   Happens to me all the time when driving in a few inches of snow.
766699,lew,2013-02-10 16:19:00,12766,"Back in the 80's I bought a Cherokee Laredo 4X4   to haul my snowmobiles around and that was one awesome vehicle , the darned thing could go just about anywhere in the snow.  I think the best commercial on TV right now is the Jeep racing down the mountain trying to outrun the avalanche,  getting buried by it and then busting out at the end....Great commercial"
766706,ketchenany,2013-02-10 16:36:00,3229," Quit rubbing it in Lew. I had a 1995 the would not quit, I sold it with 373,000 km. One of the biggest mistakes of my life. That thing was bullet proof and still running near Fergus.  I hope it's the frozen thing GBW/DRIFTER but I keep it in a garage, not heated but quite warm!"
766714,BillM,2013-02-10 16:56:00,17367,"Al, what happens is that when you put it in the garage, the snow melts and collects on the inside of the rims...   The next day you go out and the car vibrates like crazy at certain speeds."
766718,GBW,2013-02-10 17:03:00,8460,Mine in the garage and yet to melt.  It's going out of the driveway today in the sun to try and resolve it...

766766,4x4bassin,2013-02-10 20:36:00,1025,"I would say snow on the rims as well , it doesn't take much to throw the wheel out of balance . If you live near a car wash or pressure washer take it in there and that will solve your problem !"
766777,Jer,2013-02-10 21:28:00,1426,"   ...but it's a Jeep?   Seriously though, definitely snow in your wheels..."
766894,SlowPoke,2013-02-11 14:48:00,2984,I used to get a slight vibration on the highway in my Jeep. Centrifugal force would clear the snow out of the rims at about 140  
766895,jedimaster,2013-02-11 14:53:00,3472,Nice camper top..
766910,kemper,2013-02-11 16:47:00,2232,Happens from time to time when I get the Impreza sideways...  Just have to get sideways a little faster to bang it out.

766933,Raf,2013-02-11 18:27:00,3495,Miss my regular Cherokee like SlowPoke posted. Sure it doesn't have the frills but it was utilitarian. Was dissapointed when they stopped building them and replaced them with the Liberty... I now drive a Grand Cherokee but it's not the same.
766938,kemper,2013-02-11 18:39:00,2232," I suspect I will, now just need to set aside an hour and watch that bad boy"
767075,ketchenany,2013-02-12 00:07:00,3229,"Snow all melted, runs great. Thanks for all of your tips and suggestions."
