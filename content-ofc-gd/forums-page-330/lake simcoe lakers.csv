767527,yeej,2013-02-13 14:39:00,1,HI. I'm new to the forum but I've learned lots already from reading posts but I still have a question about lake simcoe lakers. how far would one have to travel to reach them? I will be walking btw. I understand that it will be a bit far but I wanna know just how far. 1-2k? any information helps. thanks!
