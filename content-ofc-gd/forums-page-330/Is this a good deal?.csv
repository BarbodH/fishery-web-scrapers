767367,Tayzak15,2013-02-12 22:59:00,318,Dan are you still on here? haha
767497,DanD,2013-02-13 11:31:00,2223,Yea I'm still around.  Dan.
765878,Tayzak15,2013-02-07 01:45:00,318,"As I'm sure some have you have noticed, I have been looking for a longshaft 20hp'ish motor for a little while and I stumbled upon this one on Kijiji  http://sarnia.kijiji.ca/c-cars-vehicles-boats-watercraft-powerboats-motorboats-20hp-Merc-tiller-W0QQAdIdZ450719926  So i just wanna ask you guys, if you think this is a good deal? were Mercury's a decent brand during that time frame? Does anyone notice anything negative in the pictures cause it looks like a near mint condition motor to me. WOuld really appreciate some responses here! Thank You in advanced."
765880,Muskieman,2013-02-07 01:55:00,2472,"That's a GREAT deal , looks like new , I used to have the same unit , you'll love the handle/gear shift !"
765881,Luke V.,2013-02-07 01:56:00,286,My uncle has that exact motor on his Lund. Runs great. Has only ever done regular maintenance.  In the pics it looks mint The stand it is on looks like it could be run. Ask him if he can put a garbage can under the motor fill with water. And see how it runs.
765883,Tayzak15,2013-02-07 02:00:00,318,"I wish I could haha, I'm a student in Toronto right now so my next step would be figuring out how to get it to Toronto from London hahah."
765889,Luke V.,2013-02-07 02:18:00,286,It surprisingly will fit in many trunks of various cars Little cardboard on the back seat....  Edit: I'm not sure how logistics plays into hearing it run....
765892,Tayzak15,2013-02-07 02:24:00,318,"Trust me haha If I had a vehicle down here I would go drive and check it out in a heartbeat! haha, but I'm from Timmins so I didn't bother bringing my truck down here figured It would be a moneypit with gas, parking ect especially since I'm just at school. The motor looks to be in very good condition though for the price. I was just wondering if people have ever used them before or had any positive/negative comments about this particular model. I'm in no rush to buy, however this seems like a very good deal."
765915,adempsey,2013-02-07 04:47:00,1498,"Odd, he lives right behind me, lol!  I could check it out for you, but I can't say I know anything about motors.  I am also heading to Toronto on Friday the 15th in the evening on my way for a weekend in Huntsville."
765920,Tayzak15,2013-02-07 05:24:00,318,Wow really? I'll try and call the guy tommorow. Is there anyway it could be paid for then I can pay you a.s.a.p if you drop it off here?
765924,porkpie,2013-02-07 08:12:00,2521,Yes that is a good deal if the motor is in the condition it appears!
765935,DanD,2013-02-07 12:36:00,2223,"I have a test barrel here at the shop (South end of London) that I’d be willing to check it over for you? It would need to come here thou, where I could pull the plugs and do a compression test, check the lower end for water contamination and of course run the thing through its passes. Let me know.  Dan."
765937,lew,2013-02-07 12:38:00,12766,Your a good man Dan !!
765967,Tayzak15,2013-02-07 15:26:00,318,Would you really? could you PM me your contact information that I could give to this guy to see if he's willing to bring it to your place for a run through before I buy it?
765978,DanD,2013-02-07 16:05:00,2223,I'll give it here; it's my place of business so why not give it a plug. LOL  D&S Auto 90 Bessemer Road Unit #6 London. Ont. 519-681-3844  Dan.
765999,Tayzak15,2013-02-07 17:45:00,318,Thank you. Is there any chance you would know anybody that routinely drives between London and Toronto as well?
766001,BillM,2013-02-07 17:54:00,17367, Rent a car and go get it.
766002,Tayzak15,2013-02-07 18:20:00,318,"I wish I could lol, I'm only 21 years old, you need to be 25 to rent a car for their insurance purposes."
766009,ratherboutdoors,2013-02-07 18:55:00,132,"Im no whaere near London, or Toronto for that matter, but what is impressive is the showing of support and generosity for a fellow member.  Kudos To all of you!!!  Best of Luck Tayzak."
766012,BillM,2013-02-07 19:06:00,17367," Almost all the rental places will rent you a vehicle as long as your 21 or over.  Hertz, AVIS, and Discount etc..."
766013,DanD,2013-02-07 19:12:00,2223," Won't be able to help you out there; but if you can make the deal with this guy, I don't mind the motor sitting here until you figure out how to pick it up.  Dan."
766017,Tayzak15,2013-02-07 19:36:00,318,Oh ok I didn't know that! I was told before that it was 25. I will look into renting sometime this weekend for next week if I can't find somebody going through the area.
766018,Tayzak15,2013-02-07 19:37:00,318,Ok thanks a lot!
766025,Tayzak15,2013-02-07 20:22:00,318,Hey there Dan I tried giving the guy a call but there was no answer. Im assuming hes at work. If I can get a hold of him would it be fine for him to drop it off anytime tommorow during your business hours if hes willing to do so? I just want the inspection done. I know someone that will be travelling from London to Orillia multiple times throughout the month so I'll just end up giving him the money to pay for the motor.
766056,adempsey,2013-02-07 22:14:00,1498,"Well, I don't have $1200 sitting around lol.   So, can't help you out there.  E-mail money transfers are easy to do anyway.    I do them all the time."
766106,Tayzak15,2013-02-08 00:45:00,318,"Ahh that's ok, I think there might be a family friend that will be travelling between orillia and london routinely for the next month or so. I really appreciate the offer though!"
766169,DanD,2013-02-08 11:54:00,2223," Yea that wouldn’t be a problem I’m here at the shop most days, Monday – Friday 7am -5:30pm. I’ll let my employees know that this might be happening, just in case this guy shows up with the motor and I’ve gone out.  Dan."
