I'm finally getting back in the game after a tough year of dealing with personal and business setbacks...let me know when you need more artwork for your site or for your contests, I'm looking forward to a New Year with new Off The Dock Toons and products!"
765224,mercman,2013-02-04 20:46:00,7054,"Pretty straight forward, easy and very very fast!!! I hate complicated check outs, and yours was smooth."
765227,mercman,2013-02-04 20:50:00,7054,"Couldnt resist those Spinnerbaits TJ.....Plus, being smoke free, i had a few bucks laying around"

765235,HTHM,2013-02-04 21:21:00,4082,"Does the stock automatically update, so if you have it it is displayed? And if it is sold, it is not displayed? I was looking for the spinnerbaits and could not find any. I guess Mercman bought you out.."
765236,TJQ,2013-02-04 21:23:00,7806,Yup... its a great system... if I dont have it ready to ship - it aint there.  Most of those tackle packs are one-offs...  Im addin a few packages right now.
765241,mercman,2013-02-04 21:46:00,7054,"Hey TJ....Got all confirming emails, and a nice thank you email too. So, systems are running fine"

765251,T-Bone,2013-02-04 22:48:00,160,Just a quick point; I was looking at jigs 2-color and can't tell if it's $1.95 per jig or pack. Most jigs I buy are in packs of 10 or 25. So if it's per pack please indicate quantity. The site is nice and smooth...nice job.
765252,Wolf 3,2013-02-04 22:55:00,134,"Looks good.  Best of luck!   If you scroll down, it will show the quantity under the heading ""Product Description""."
765253,T-Bone,2013-02-04 23:00:00,160,Ah...I have no idea how but I missed that before. Order coming soon...great value. Love the Odds N Ends area...
765254,TJQ,2013-02-04 23:02:00,7806,"Yup... all the jigs are 5 packs... if ya need 25 just order 5 packs.. the prices are good.. the prices on the assorted packs are really REALLY good!  But good point, ill figure out how to make that more obvious."
765273,Handlebarz,2013-02-04 23:45:00,3790,Tj it looks nice and simple clean that is a good change from some sites there is yo much clutter.  All the best with the new adventure
765275,aplumma,2013-02-04 23:57:00,6896,That is a nice system t.j.  it looks like it is a place to check back every few days to see what nugget of goodness pops up.  Art

Mostly Jigs and Spoons right now, but lots more coming down the pipe.  Prices are already good, but OFC'rs can get a 5% Discount for the next month with this coupon code at checkout.

Drop in browse around, and please let me know what you think!  Constructive criticism always gratefully received.  Ill be adding tons more stuff as we get closer to spring.
