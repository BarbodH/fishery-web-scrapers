767081,chris.brock,2013-02-12 00:22:00,4053,"Guy's weekend at the cotttage turned into 2 guys and a kid's weekend at the cottage. The city slickers didn't want to drive in the snow.  We drove up on Friday morning. A little slow, but not too bad. Most people stayed home and off the highways.  On Saturday, we decided to hit the lake I had done the previous weekend, looking for splake.  To avoid bushwacking, we skirted an area with moving water. My track broke through a little. Matt's sled, with alot more power than the Bravo, just hit the gas.  This pic was taken on the trip out.    Some snowshoeing required    The Bravo loaded up, lots of powder snow    A nice, sunny day, very little wind, pretty with the fresh snow    splake    Ryan's first fish through the ice    Matt with a splake    Ryan taking a break from fishing    watching the tip-ups    we landed 8 fish, kept 1 that was hooked bad, the weather was deceptively cold, our holes kept freezing, we were a little lazy and didn't trudge through the deep snow to check our tip-ups, often when we checked, the hole was frozen and the minnow was gone, I think we likely missed 5 bites  We all had a great day, the Leafs beating the Habs 6-0 later, was just a perfect topper"

I haven't been out for trout in weeks, it's been hard to justify the extra gas with nipissing on fire right on my doorstep, but change is in order.  I hear ya about being a little lazy with line checking.  I tend to get content just sitting around the fire"
767103,chris.brock,2013-02-12 00:47:00,4053," yeah, a couple drinks, a nice sunny day, catching fish gets a little less important"
