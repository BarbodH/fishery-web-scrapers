767267,Double What??,2013-02-12 15:44:00,29,"Hi all,  Does anyone know what this old Luhr Jensen crankbait is called?  Thanks in advance for any help...  DW"
767273,Roy,2013-02-12 16:08:00,13728,It looks like someone stuck a Luhr Jensen lip into another bait.
767274,jedimaster,2013-02-12 16:09:00,3472,"Looks like a shad colored lipped rattle trap with the hologram sticker being added on after, but I can't recall ever seeing a rattle trap with a lip before."
767277,Double What??,2013-02-12 16:15:00,29,"Is definitely not a rattle trap.  The lip was not added after the fact.  The lure was bought new (many years ago) as-is.  The prism tape was original but is now peeling off.  The lure is made of wood.  Cheers, DW"
767290,Harrison,2013-02-12 17:14:00,2202,I have some knowledge of vintage lures and I do not recognize it. I agree it looks like a mod job or better yet a LJ proto type.
767296,jedimaster,2013-02-12 17:58:00,3472,Do you have a front on shot of it?
767301,Double What??,2013-02-12 18:12:00,29,"At the moment, I have only 2 other pics and they are no straight-on, they are pretty similar to the 1st photo but, here they are....  I won't have access to the lure again until April sometime.  Thanks for the help! DW  "
767307,jedimaster,2013-02-12 18:25:00,3472,Maybe an older Speed Trap.... http://www.ebay.com/itm/Older-Pre-Rapala-Made-Luhr-Jensen-Speed-Trap-1-4-oz-Crystal-Tenn-Shad-/281057770371?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&hash=item4170593b83  http://www.ebay.com/itm/Luhr-Jensen-Speed-Trap-1-8-Oz-Green-Sunfish-/130850304572?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&hash=item1e7749323c
767313,Double What??,2013-02-12 18:47:00,29,"Close, but definitely not speed traps.  I searched ""Luhr Jensen"" lure currently on ebay and didn't see another one like the one I have.    DW"
767341,Handlebarz,2013-02-12 21:53:00,3790,Pm outlaw he knows alot he might have seen them in the past
767356,fishindevil,2013-02-12 22:34:00,6254,"Did they not have an old version before the rattletrap called the ""trap"" R ???? I sort of remember it !!!! Hmmmmmmm...... Got me thinkin now    Lol"
767358,misfish,2013-02-12 22:41:00,29133,"I,ll bet if you peel that tape off,you see a painted bait. Looks like it was added IMO. Just the way it,s peeling back off the tail. I dont think they had that tape back then. Just saying."
767359,outllaw,2013-02-12 22:41:00,1232,its a luhr jensen lip installed in another lure.
767364,Roy,2013-02-12 22:50:00,13728, Thanks George
767505,jedimaster,2013-02-13 13:26:00,3472,"I email phil Jensen yesterday, he said he remember making it but he can't remember the name, he is on vacation for the winter and said he would check his catalogue when he gets home. He said it wasn't a big seller and was very forgettable, and was only in the lineup for a few years."
767512,outllaw,2013-02-13 13:50:00,1232,well i never seen that one. we did thousands threw the years.
767523,jedimaster,2013-02-13 14:30:00,3472,"I would think there were thousands of little variations of lures over the years. It looks a bit like an elongatedspeed trap, maybe a predecessor or something. who knows."
767578,outllaw,2013-02-13 17:52:00,1232,"from the 80,s to 2000. we custom painted cases of jensen products for ontario dealers.as for variations yes luhr jensen had a complete line-up and then some. too bad they sold out. now theres dis-continued models rapala,shelved."
767582,Double What??,2013-02-13 18:03:00,29,"Well, forgettable?  Maybe but... man, that is/was 1 excellent producing lure for me.  Retired now.  Thanks guys  DW"
