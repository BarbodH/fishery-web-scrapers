767224,Rich,2013-02-12 11:31:00,3927,"So... You're literally parked in one spot all day? Sounds like 60% of the challenge of tournament fishing (finding fish) has been taken care of for you. Or worse yet, is chosen based on convenience, not abundance of fish? I'd say whoever gets the best spot prettyy much guarantees the win...  Im not trying to be rude or belittle or mock, im just confused. I'd be hard pressed to pay into something where I cant even choose or move my spot.. that's a big deal and is completely unnecessary in north america..  Once again, I just want clarification if possible, how is pole position decided? At random?  Thanks for the post, i knew nothing of carp tournaments happening in ontario until you posted."
767225,Roy,2013-02-12 11:49:00,13728,"Thanks for that, Lorne. For those of us, such as myself, who don't know about these things, it's a great educational thread."
767236,Mike Pike,2013-02-12 13:27:00,1332,"Awesome post, Lorne.  Although I've yet to participate in one of these, I most surely will in the upcoming season.  Easy to see what a good bit of fun you can have in a day, with some bragging rights for the winner."
767242,LucG,2013-02-12 13:45:00,779,Very interesting! Quite different from a regular tourny.
767243,Gallie,2013-02-12 13:47:00,1215,Sounds like fun to me. Reminds me of times when my friends and i would skip school to fish carp and catfish in the holland river. Now we skip work;)
767269,fishindevil,2013-02-12 15:58:00,6254,"it would be better if an angler can switch pegs every 2 hours and rotate using a random draw for spots !!! would make it more interesting !!! ya its hard to think that you cannot just move from your spot its picked for you ?? interesting and different all at the same time...thanks for sharing,"
767284,hammercarp,2013-02-12 16:40:00,964,"Rich . Carp fishing is more like trapping than hunting. Carp are drawn into your swim by the bait you put in the water. Carp can follow a trail of scent to your bait from quite a distance away. Although scent is not quite the right description since carp can detect stuff like dissolved salt in the water and find the source of it. This is not the only way carp are drawn into you swim either. An anglers skill and knowledge comes into play. Understanding your quarry, reading the waters, determining what bait to use and  where to place your bait and baited hook are all factors in determinating who finishes ""in the money"". Every peg presents the angler with challenges they need to overcome. If by pole position you mean  the peg where you fish. I explained that the angler draws a number and that number corresponds to a peg. It is random. Sometimes if there are a lot more pegs than competitors the organizers will allow  anglers draw again if they wish or even draw twice and chose from the two. This has to be made clear before the event to all who are entered. This was done on the St. Lawrence for the worlds championship a couple of years ago. For small tournaments I don't like this as it may give guys with local knowledge an advantage over guys coming from a distance away who are not familiar with the waters being fished."
767285,mike rousseau,2013-02-12 16:41:00,4661,"There's a lot more too it then location....  Location is important to success but when ""swims"" are chosen they all hold fish.... And depending on wind/weather conditions the ""best swim"" can change every day....  And considering then length of a carp tournament baiting/chumming techniques are as important as location...."
767286,mike rousseau,2013-02-12 16:47:00,4661,I've also fished side by side (sitting 10 feet apart) with other carp anglers and completely spanked them... Like 10-1... On a regular basis....
767366,porkpie,2013-02-12 22:51:00,2521,"Not for me, but interesting reading none the less!  Thanks for posting it!"
767375,aplumma,2013-02-12 23:32:00,6896,Thanks Lorne the roots to Carp fishing tournaments are in Europe I believe and the area you have to fish are quite different than the waterways we are blessed with here. The sport over there are very formal in dress and actions and that blends in to the rules of yesteryear and flavor the rules we follow over here.  Art
767450,Mike Pike,2013-02-13 02:12:00,1332,"Yup, our waterways and those in Europe are different to be sure, but the fish are the same.  A carp's behavior and, therefore, our ways to catch them are similar.  Whether European water or our waters here, carp tournaments can be run in similar ways due to the nature of the fish."
767461,hammercarp,2013-02-13 02:53:00,964,I am going to hold you to that Mike when we fish with the Americans in this years CanAm tournament. It will be in your home waters.  I expect you to do nothing less for our country. We are ahead 3 to 2 so they will be looking to tie things up.
767464,hammercarp,2013-02-13 03:01:00,964,You are right Art we do follow the European procedures for carp tournaments. But you would be surprised to know that carp fishing tournaments have a long history in your country as well. Paylakes in the southern states run carp tournaments every weekend . There are even paylakes in Ohio. But the paylakes in North Carolina have over a 50 year history of having these events. I fish paylake style.  .
767467,kemper,2013-02-13 03:19:00,2232,"Interesting, for sure but not for me.  Anyone who has fished with me knows that I would last about 3 minutes at an event like that. I get fishing ADD even when I'm standing in a run full of fresh chromers, I literally can't stand in one place for more than 20 minutes even when it's one after another."
767469,mike rousseau,2013-02-13 03:41:00,4661,It's very different....  A lot of second guessing your decisions...  And considering we only get 1 rod in Ontario... All your eggs are in one basket... Overseas you get 2-3-4 rods... So you can have different baits out...  Even NY state gets 3 rods now...
767492,Rich,2013-02-13 11:03:00,3927,"Well, I don't carp fish that way... I've tossed bags of corn in where there are no fish. If they aren't close enough to smell it, you're outta luck.  Either way, cool stuff."
767503,kemper,2013-02-13 12:58:00,2232,"Does anyone fish carp from a boat?  About the only time I fish for carp is in the spring when there isn't much open and the bows aren't co-operation.  Fun on the fly and the 'pin, but even then I get bored with the bulldog battle pretty quickly..."
767507,Mike Pike,2013-02-13 13:41:00,1332,"Funny you mention about a boat Kemper, cuz I recently watched the Fishin' Canada boyz doing a carp show in their boat.  They were fishing a warm water discharge at some plant near Toronto using a traditional carp presentation( corn on a hair rig ).  I personally don't know anyone who fishes carp from a boat. though."
767535,mike rousseau,2013-02-13 15:56:00,4661,It's tricky....  I've done it before... And realized pretty quickly that a full set up of carp gear fills a boat pretty fast...  I'm looking to try again this year with a more streamlined approach....
767540,Rich,2013-02-13 16:18:00,3927,I fish them in a boat all through spring as shore access to good spots is often limited.
767580,John,2013-02-13 17:55:00,2956,"Thanks for that Lorne. I have fished public and private waters for Carp in the UK and while there are some monsters over there they are mostly ""pet fish"" especially in the ponds... (lakes). I have never fished Carp over here but it sounds like I should start.."
767581,mike rousseau,2013-02-13 18:02:00,4661, Lots of fish and some big ones too... I know a few that have broke 40lbs and 1 guy that broke 50lbs.... Also... 2 years ago someone had a 90+fish day....  The biggest challenge is finding them... In small lakes in UK you know they are close... Here... The closest carp may be miles away and you don't know... But that's part if the fun...  And before anyone says 40lbs is a record and I'm lying... I'm sure a lot of other carpers will confirm the record is broken multiple times every year... Just nobody wants to kill the fish to get the record...   ...
