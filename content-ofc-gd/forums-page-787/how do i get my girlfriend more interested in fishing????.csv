384128,Cudz,2009-09-17 04:02:00,2652,"If she doesn't mind you going by yourself then keep her.  If she gets annoyed at your ""fishing all the time"" then I have to agree with radnine, throw her back.  She ain't a keeper. If she is just your girlfriend and she gives you grief, she will really give you trouble when you get married.  Get out while you can.  Find a girl who likes to fish.  PS.  Being Romantic and fishing have nothing to do with each other.  Leave the romance stuff to other activities, like theater, dinners, walks etc.  For me fishing really isn't romantic.  I would rather fish with the boys, but that is just my opinion.  Good luck"

Had an issue once and I explained I dont drink ( too much ) I dont cheat or womenize, gamble so on and so on, never once has she said a single word....encourages me to fish at every opportunity and one of these days I ll get around to installing the closed circuit camera in the house just to see who in fact owns that mercedes parked in my driveway when I go fishin"

(Pretty bad eh?---most players would take another angle)  Anyway she said yes and I said great I'll pick you up at 7 tomorrow morn and we'll go.  (I now give her heck for headin down some creek with a complete stranger---I tell her how'd you know I was'nt a nut)  Anyway 2 kids and 25 years later---kids now away in university and it's her and I gone fishin.  Much like the Dawg though---she likes the nice warm days now--so I do get gone on my own some times.  Good Luck

""oh hey lets go for a walk.. maybe cast a line or two"" phrase .. works for me.. but trust me they will catch on .. and as soon as they start getting bored.. u better start talking about sumthing amusing to her.. or start packin up.. or else they get grumpy on you lol thats just my two cents.

384222,Fishnwire,2009-09-17 15:02:00,983,"I always told every woman I ever dated, very early in our relationship, that fishing and being outdoors was very important to me, and that I would always devote a good portion of my time to those pursuits.  If that was going to be a problem, that was the end of that relationship.  My wife knew the score long before I put a ring on her finger, and she's OK with it.  I take her with me occasionally.  The last few years she hasn't bothered to buy a licence, so she sits in the boat and reads.  She has basically no interest in the sport.  She was in the boat one day when I was on a really good top-water bite.  That's something you would think would be somewhat fun to watch...seeing big bass break surface to smash a popper...pretty cool, right?  She never even looked up from her book the whole time.  The thing is, she's just as happy to stay on shore, and even though I love the girl, I don't really miss her a whole lot while the bite is on.  My point is, maybe you shouldn't force anything on her.  You might be better off just doing your own thing and letting her do her own thing.  There's plenty of time to be together...when fishing conditions are unfavourable.  If you are really set on the idea of making a fisher""person"" out of her, I'd say the first thing you should do is get her her own rod that she can get used to, and spend some time teaching her how to throw a proper cast.  Go to a dock or section of open shoreline and show her how it is done and get her to practice.  Those of us that have fished all our lives sometimes forget that casting is something that needs to be learned and is one of fishing's most basic and valuable skills."

If it gets windy, cold, etc.. she may just sit in the van and read. She is not the ""big game hunter"", nor is she an outdoor enthusiast, but she don't mind. Your girlfriend, future wife, etc..., does not have to like fishing. She just has to accept that this is your passion and give you the freedom to pursue it. You, in turn, must be just as accepting as your other half. Just make sure you set aside time to d othings together. The idea of taking the girl out to catch pannies is the ticket. Keep it simple and fun. Do not push the serious side of fishing. That is only to be shared with fellow junkies. As you are probably going to be baiting the hooks and taking the fish off for both of you, accept that she will outfish you and never let you forget it. It's part of the fun.  I've gone out with the wife and daughter pannie fishing in the boat, caught hardly a thing, and spent 2 hours fileting a boatload of large gills and crappie."

Now if she does not like it but lets you get away when you want that is a good thing if she gets mad and makes a fuss over it you will have to leave her and find a new one that is not a joke if you want to have a long relationship with her and maybe one day tie the knot if she puts up a fuss now then you dont want to be there when you have a house and kids.  I am lucky my family loves to fish but my wife also does not mind when I go on trips like this weekend I am off again for a musky trip and the family will be here having there own weekend I love having them out with me but this time of year its hard with the cold nights and not knowing the daily weather
384346,scuro2,2009-09-17 21:32:00,904," You can tell she is really having fun here.  The easy way is to just spend money! If this is the one you love, then you have no problems forking over cake so that you can share your passion together. Two years ago I took my wife river fishing in Terrace BC, for Chinook. She still asks about going back to BC. She comes with me on one yearly week of fishing per year. We spend a good chunk of change to make sure that the place we go takes care of all the creature comforts. I don't regret spending a single penny of that money, and I'll treasure those memories forever.  "
384378,Canuck2fan,2009-09-17 23:05:00,1444,I agree with the lots of fish and short trip part. Another thing you could do is take her fishing where a lot of women fish. I spent a lot of time on the pier in Pt Bruce this summer and if it wasn't pouring rain there it was always a lot of female anglers there some days more women than men.  Also it tended to be more a social gathering this year as the fishing wasn't all that great. Everyone for the most part gets along well and they do a lot of joking around. Maybe seeing lots of other women fishing and having someone to talk to would work at getting her interested long term.

I usually leave my own rod in the trunk and end up being the 'guide' for the first few trips till they get the hang of things.  A lot of the time I'm usually too busy re-tying, unhooking fish, pulling hooks and sinkers out of snags and trees, etc to be fishing myself...It really does pay to be patient and encouraging even when the proverbial bird's nest happens.   You and me both...Cheers to that!  I've posted this story on a past thread but it may come in handy one day  A few years ago I decided to take one special lady angler to a quiet stretch of river for some steelheading. She fished quite a bit…More than any girl I’ve ever met and she was a trooper when it came to the cold and rain. She was new to river fishing though along with wading, rock hopping and felt sole boots.  I hook into a nice fish, engaged the clicker on the centrepin and handed her the rod. She was thrilled to fight her first ever steelhead. Got the palming technique just right within seconds…She was a natural with the pin. The fish runs downstream a bit, around a bend and into a pool where the bank is a fairly steep muddy slope. You might’ve guessed it…Mud and felt don’t mix and she was going in fast!…  As she was sliding in, I made the mistake of yelling out, “Save the reel!”...Apparently a VERY BIG mistake. We left IMMEDIATELY afterward and it was a long and uncomfortable ride home. She was soaked and if it wasn’t for the SPF50 sunscreen I was wearing, she would’ve burned a hole through my head with those “what the hell looks” she gave me every 30 seconds. I’ve never been so afraid for myself and my tackle…"

We are now in the process of getting her setup with waterfowl clothing and it is better than my own????  Don;t push her.

384063,ohhenrygsr,2009-09-17 01:13:00,947,  Yea getting your significant other interested in fishing is LIKE fishing.  Takes patience and time sooner our later you'll convince them to understand why you do what you do.  Also helps to take them to spots that are kinda like your honey holes.  That's when the memories will begin and the fun starts.  But don't forget it goes both ways.  You will have to do what they love doing too.  
384066,ohhenrygsr,2009-09-17 01:16:00,947,Also take her Rod and tackle shopping.  I think she will appreciate it more when she choose the tackle and catch fish on it.

384092,JohnF,2009-09-17 02:12:00,3494,"Last fall I talked my wife into joining me for a riverwalk. She was to be the photographer while I fished. I fitted her (sort of) into an old pair of rubber waders from a friend and off we went. It was a perfect day, warm but with a hint of autumn in the air & some colour in the leaves. I didn't make a big deal out of it but she kept saying for a few days after how pretty the river was.  Fast forward to this spring just before bass opener - My wife actually suggested that it might be okay if I was to get her a fishing licence. She wouldn't come right out and ask for it, but she was willing to put up with me buying her one. So I did.  Took her to the creek on bass opener and she caught a pretty little smallmouth shortly after we hit the water - and before I caught anything. She was pretty obnoxious about it but I wisely kept my mouth shut. I didn't even laugh when she asked me to take it off the hook.  Then this past weekend she bought herself some waders, wonder of wonders. I guess she's joining me on the river this weekend.  That's how you do it. I have no idea what I said or did, but it worked fine.  Now I guess I oughta  ask her to take some pics in a bassboat ............ by a cottage .......... who knows what might transpire????????  JF"
