Wellllllllll,turns out I was a darn dumb I had a 4 mg chip,and the cam only works on a 1mg.So I went to CTC today,picked another up,hooked it up,and it now,is straped to a tree at the feeder location. Can wait til saturday to change up the chip and put the cam near another stand. Probly the corn field area.  Thanks again. Brian"

384375,troutologist,2009-09-17 22:45:00,951,"Though my computer's card reader won't read an SDHC, I can still hook up a USB cable from the camera to the computer and transfer that way. Not sure if that is an option for your setup?"
384380,richyb,2009-09-17 23:18:00,774,"HAHA, atleast you figured out the problem. Cant wait to see some pics of what you have in your area. Theres been a new 8 pointer showing up around my stands lately.     The batteries dont last the longest but the pics are pretty clear for the price. Mine was dead today when I went to check it. Its been in the bush for 3 weeks , 30ish pics. plus playing around trying to figure out how it works at the house.    Good luck"
384382,misfish,2009-09-17 23:23:00,29133,"Thanks guys. I went and bought one, 1mg chip(not easy to find, let me tell ya) and it turns out the mrs,s cam will take the 4mg chip (bonus for her,and me ) So I got her two 1mgs she bought aswell. Now Im all set.   Just hope I set the trail cam program right."
384384,misfish,2009-09-17 23:26:00,29133,"Rich, thats a very nice buck.  Cant wait for my pic results.  30 days is what they say. Im back and forth every three days.   Wait,that deer is from the future.2014.You got to wait a few years.HAHAHAHA"
384385,richyb,2009-09-17 23:29:00,774,"The set up is pretty simple. My dad did it and he cant even work a digital camera. Theres step by step instructions inside the door on the camera. ( dad set the time and date, thats why im taking pics of deer in the future 2014)"
