383286,wask,2009-09-15 02:48:00,174,"There are a couple of Marinas on Chemong Lake in Bridgenorth that rent boats.  I can't remember the price, but I found it to be cheaper than most, but I haven't rented a boat in a couple of years so I don't remember exactly."
383376,castgame,2009-09-15 12:34:00,161,"thanks! now, does anybody know how chemong is for bass fishing?"
383412,fish-miester,2009-09-15 13:40:00,864,"chemong's not a bad lake at all , went there in really crummy weather and was still able to land a few decent fish"
383435,castgame,2009-09-15 15:10:00,161,thinking of scrapping the boat rental and just hitting it by canoe... problem with the kawarthas is there's just so much good looking water to choose from! guess i'll pick a lake today and get back to you all
383436,wask,2009-09-15 15:17:00,174,"Check out my post on Long Lake.  It is in the Kawartha Highlands Park, which is mostly crown land with a few cottages.  Tons of good fishing, low pressure and lots of camping.  most of the water is smaller so it is great for Canoeing."
383442,castgame,2009-09-15 15:34:00,161, very helpful! thanks wask. i will def keep this in mind when heading up there
383504,Tom McCutcheon,2009-09-15 19:22:00,627,"If you are fishing in most of the Kawarthas please be aware that the Hammer Handles you are talking about will more than likely be small Muskie. At this moment only a small percentage of Kawartha Lakes have Pike in them, Balsam being one of them. Please release any Muskie which you catch and good fishing.  Tom."
383732,castgame,2009-09-16 04:37:00,161,"tom, i'm going to release anything except a couple of walleye and maybe the odd smallie thanks for the heads up though, good to know  ended up hitting long lake today, thanks again wask. the smallies were hitting often (first cast!), but lightly--only landed a few little ones, 6-10"". couldn't find any of any size, not down deep, shallow, on bottom, or the surface. ah well, the lake was gorgeous and it was a beautiful day on the water!  saw a roadkilled juvenile bear on hwy 28 just south of the lake. first for me and a sad sight"
383844,wask,2009-09-16 15:27:00,174,"  Cool man, glad the fishing was good.  It definitely is a great place to fish, even when the fishing is bad."
383874,Tom McCutcheon,2009-09-16 17:16:00,627,  Thanks.... too bad about the bear. Not the first one I have heard of or seen this year.
