383253,joefish,2009-09-15 02:24:00,165,"Going to Sandals Varadero Friday with my better half to celebrate 27 years of wedded bliss.  Should I even consider bringing rod and tackle or is there no fishing to be had on site?  Looking at Google Map of the area there is a lagoon behind the resort and according to resort advise the water is too shallow out in front.  Anybody been there and offering advice would be appreciated.  My youngest commandeered my camera, taking it to Thunder Bay to film his first flight instruction so I might not have many pictures.  Thanks in advance and hope to hear back from any one....Joe"

Secondly... the aren't any fish in Cuba!!!... unless you llike ""Killer"" fricken 'Cudas and Tarpoons!!!   ... this time of year, the night bite will be your best bet!!!  ... Just leave your name and cell phone # with the front deszk so they can tell a couple weeks after you've sent this message that nyou're indeed an AMERICAN CITIZEN!!!"
383282,scuro2,2009-09-15 02:45:00,904,"Will it drive you crazy to be near water and not fish? If not, enjoy your week because you could fish the week and catch little. If it would bother you near that water, bring a good pike rod, reel, and leader set up. Cudas are always around, and love a very fast chase. Their hits are electric. Sweedish pimples in silver and gold work well...nothing with a lot of wobble, at least that is what I have found. Spooks and chugs work too. Bring some deerhair jigs in white, silver and party colours. You can usually get uncooked seafood from the resort. Try sunrise on an incoming high tide. Watershoes and a very good pair of polarized sunglasses also helps. If you do venture into the water to fish, do the moonwalk shuffle. Nothing worse then stepping under a buried stingray."

You sound like you are researching the same way I did, using google earth...  Check out my report for some tips and locations nearby...man I love Cuba!  http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/index.p...amp;hl=varadero  Tony"
383694,joefish,2009-09-16 02:55:00,165,"Thanks Tony!  That lagoon looks pretty dark. To me it looks like a drain for all the resorts in the area.  I think I'm gonna re spool my reel with some braid because if I snag something I think I'm gonna need some power.  GCD, I dont mind my boy taking my cameras. He just started college and I think he's a bit excited about earning his wings  .    Scuro2, wow great advice...Thanks!"
383783,tonyb,2009-09-16 12:51:00,1637," The lagoon water is actually very clear before the boats start churning it up mid-morning.  I was sight fishing the smaller cuda's with the shrimp as you could see them hiding in predictable 'ambush' spots.  I'm jealous bud, your going to love it.  I ran 50lb power pro with 45-55lb seaguar flouro leader, but I'm not sure if the cuda's are line shy or not...they do strike with a purpose  For the smaller fish and weightless gulp shrimp I dropped down to 20-30lb flouro, gives the shrimp a more natural slow sink...  Looking forward to hearing how you did when you get back!  Have a mojito or two for me  Tony"
