384190,Sherriff,2009-09-17 13:59:00,252,Heading north this weekend to Pigeon Lake and just found out some friends are staying in Buckhorn.  MIght drop by if the boat ride is not too far...  Does anyone have a rough estimate for how long a boat ride it is from Pigeon Lake to Buckhorn Lake.  I will be going about 30 miles per hour ish....  Thanks Sherriff
384251,jediangler,2009-09-17 16:04:00,1923,It depends where you are on Pigeon. From Camp Ashtabula it takes 10-15 minutes in a rental w/9.9hp. Where is your destination on Buckhorn?
384277,muskeybugged,2009-09-17 17:00:00,282,You won't need a supply of food and clothes to change into.  Do-able @ 30 mph IMO.
384305,Tom McCutcheon,2009-09-17 17:57:00,627,10 to 15 minutes from the Gannon Narrows bridge. Just make sure you stay in the marked channel when you go thru the chute heading into Buckhorn at the top end of Chemong.  Tom.
