Slow cranking a taildancer or running a bottom bouncer rig and spinner and worm are the two most popular choices this time of year. If your in that end of the bay you will most  likely be launching in Trenton , its still a little early to fish the river but it still does cough up fish in the mouth. Try on the big weed flats behind CFB trenton, nice bass and some good weed walleyes in there, try to stay on the greenest weeds you can find as they will just be starting to die of now."
