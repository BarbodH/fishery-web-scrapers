Has anyone ever fished nine mile lake in the parry sound area? Me and some friends of mine sort of randomly picked it off a map and are going to give it a try Saturday. Any advice (fishing quality, rock/stump dangers) would be greatly appreciated.  Also, if anyone has any tips on lakes in that area for catching big pike that would be useful information as well.  Thanks"

Not too much up to date info for you, BUT after you launch at the beach, you will vere to the right to follow the lake north. Be very careful as there is a shallow water area with boulders, which may or may not be marked."
