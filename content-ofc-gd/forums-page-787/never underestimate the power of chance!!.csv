383777,scugpg,2009-09-16 12:29:00,1373,"Just read through this post that would've been scary as hell! Glad you made it out ok. I find this works really well to avoid burning rubber at the launch & panic'ing from rolling back:  Always use the e-brake, especially with manual transmission. When I'm bringing it up from the ramp I always put it in gear while the ebrake is on, gas it a bit to have pressure on the ebrake and then release ebrake and go slow up the launch, avoids rollback gunning it and spinning."
383808,Flappn,2009-09-16 13:37:00,245,Wow I have a stick 4runner and can't imagine this happening to me. I think I am going to chalk the wheels from now on and get my e-brake inspected. Thx for posting it's a good reminder why we should always be alert and on the look out.
383816,canadadude,2009-09-16 13:56:00,769,"My buddy is truck driver and he always chalks the wheel before launching the boat, I always thought this was going overboard but after seeing this I think now he is a pretty smart dude.He says it's just a habit for him to do this and I think it's a good habit to get into! You just never no, and if something lets go and your behind the tow vehicle a much worse outcome may happen. Chalking your tires is mandatory at shipping docks perhaps it should be on ramps aswell"
383834,Jonny,2009-09-16 14:45:00,1380,"I've launched many times from ""unimproved"" ramps over the course of my fishing life, some of them pretty hairy.  You probably know this, but you should be using your parking brake every few weeks, even if you don't need it. As far as I know the most common failure for that brake is because it rusts up and seizes because of lack of use.  Chocking a wheel is a ten-second job that can save you a lot of grief. You don't really have to chock both; one is good enough.  Loose gravel is as bad as sand. It's like your wheels are trying to get a grip on marbles. We used to carry a come-along, a steel post (old mining drill bit) and an axe for emergencies. If there was no tree to tie to, we'd hammer in the post, attach the come-along and use it to assist the truck out of difficulty. Had to do that once or twice. It's a slow process but at least you're not stuck in the middle of nowhere with no options.  Heck, a truck box is made to fill with junk --- some of it might as well be remotely useful."
363158,DRIFTER_016,2009-07-17 01:34:00,10439,DOH!!! That's why I always set the parking brake on the ramp.
363173,danbouck,2009-07-17 02:12:00,4380,Glad your OK!
363179,Greencoachdog,2009-07-17 02:23:00,8163,"  Yeah, there's a lot to be said for a full sized tow vehicle with a good parking brake!!!"
363187,brkygetr,2009-07-17 02:35:00,425," well then I feel for ya...cause you know Wayne I have been in a lot worse situations that turned out way better, ...'normal and somewhat non-eventfull' I guess you could say. The part that bites my ass is that i have been in and out of that launch close to 50 times and never had a problem...regardless I hope your weekends improve."
363194,Carp,2009-07-17 02:48:00,1488,"I drove a 5 speed pick-up for years. At the ramp I always set the parking brake hard, put it in 1st gear & turned off the engine. Always held my foot on the brake and eased off gently until I felt the weight of the truck rest on the parking brake. If I had any doubts, I released the brake and did it all over again. On steep ramps, I even threw a piece of wood under a rear tire is case the truck started sliding back.  The fact that it's a steep ramp probably had a lot to do with what happened. Glad you're OK. Hope the damage to the boat and truck was minimal."
363198,Greencoachdog,2009-07-17 02:55:00,8163,"  That wouldn't happen to be ""Morning Wood"" would it???  Chocking the tires on a steep ramp with a standard transmission is always a good idea!!!   ... are you learning anything here brkygetter???"
363200,tinbanger,2009-07-17 02:57:00,1028,"wow  saw a guy at thw Barrie marina o the same thing 3 years ago ,,, but he had an audience!  Glad your ok  TB"
363208,brkygetr,2009-07-17 03:29:00,425," funny thing is i know better, I have been doing this for a while...I gues this is why it never pays to become complacent about your abilities or actions, hence the probability of chance. Usually i would have thrown a rock under the tire but this particular time ( and others that turned out fine) i did not as one was not readily available...and I did shut off the truck in 1st and let the weight set...I even shift the truck with my weight as i step out to make sure it will hold..it did. Just not long enough."
363225,Jonny,2009-07-17 04:44:00,1380,"Wow that sucks big time.  I take it you had to sit tight overnight and wait for somebody to show up? That would be a long, looong night!  With both truck and boat in the water, how did you manage to have an emergency kit? Did some stuff float out of the boat or the truck box?"
363233,tambo,2009-07-17 05:20:00,85,"i too drive a standard 2 wheel drive truck.  i lauched it for the first time this week, my heart was racing. taking it out was an adventure, i burnt sojme rubber pulling it out, kinda panicked when the truck jolted back when i took my foot off the break.  i'm gonna try blocking the tires with something next time..........is it alright to do this? tambo"
363244,Cudz,2009-07-17 06:04:00,2652,Wow.  Looks like the motor stayed out of the wter until the truck got pulled out and then the boat flipped over.  If that is the case than that kind of sucks as well. Sorry to hear about that though.  Good reminder to us to take care on launches.
363246,Jonny,2009-07-17 06:33:00,1380," On a steep ramp, standard or not, good parking brake or not, I've always had my wife or a partner ready with a wood block when I say to put it behind the wheel. Usually put one on both sides.  It's a good idea to keep something in the back of the truck - you often can't find something suitable at a landing. Pieces of split log (triangular cross-section) work well. Big enough so the wheel can't ride over them, and kicked in hard to lessen the chance of them sliding.  Before you even back up, you need to check carefully that there isn't an underwater ""lip"" that your trailer tires can fall off of as you let the trailer into the water. So many lauches are 'broken up"" or ""unimproved"", up north anyway.  EDIT - the thing about not launching properly (on gravel anyway) is that you can bugger up the launch for other people, or for yourself the next time. If you tromp on the gas and spin your wheels, you loosen the gravel and dig holes."
363277,BillM,2009-07-17 12:57:00,17367,"I'd turn the truck off and leave it in gear..  There is no way the weight of the trailer is going to pull it in the water, especially with the e-brake engaged...   Make sure the boat is unhooked before it even gets close to the water (tiedowns, winch, etc)...  Even if you somehow screw up and the truck goes back a few feet, the boat won't be attached to the trailer so it won't pull the rear wheels of the truck off the ground..  If I was using a 2wd truck, I'd always have a winch just in case....  Nothing worse then 2wd and no weight in the bed...  Pretty useless."
363279,Cast-Away,2009-07-17 13:11:00,790,"Is your real name Dick Shrivels from Coldwater? I would think so after swimming out to try and salvage the boat! Seriousely, glad that you are okay."
363282,cuillerierk,2009-07-17 13:15:00,32,Man that sucks big time. I hate landing a boat with a standard truck.      Glad your ok though.
363289,stuck on shore,2009-07-17 13:35:00,9,Just glad that you are safe. Sorry about your weekend!
363296,Stoty,2009-07-17 13:56:00,2910, HAHAHA
363316,DRIFTER_016,2009-07-17 14:48:00,10439,"  Bill You don't want to completely disconect your boat before you launch it, especially if you have a roller trailer. You're boat will have a very good chance of rolling off the trailer before it gets near the water. Always disconect your winch strap after the boat is floating. I loosen off the stap about a foot so the boat doesn't bind on the nose roller."
363330,Fish4Eyes,2009-07-17 15:21:00,1022,"Clear example why you leave it to the Germans to make manual transmissions  . Now i'm going to get raided by all the guys who have the sticker on their car saying ""out of a job yet, keep buying foreign""."
363332,BillM,2009-07-17 15:30:00,17367,"  Hey Dave,  Never thought of the trailers with rollers.   I know on ours, the boat isn't going anywhere, even on the steepest of ramps with everything disconnected.  But it's only a 15ft tinny, not the heaviest boat out there."
363342,Whitespinnerbait,2009-07-17 15:59:00,2038,The next day I must have back right down in your old tracks..        
363360,Fish4Eyes,2009-07-17 16:42:00,1022, Is it honestly worth the risk?
363386,pikehunter,2009-07-17 17:14:00,1659,"You just reminded me that I do need to get my E brake fixed.  Glad you're OK, but how bad is the damage $$$"
363411,brkygetr,2009-07-17 18:15:00,425,yes it was a roller trailer so disconecting it means boat off trailer...and as far as damage I'm pretty sure the truck is done as it was under water for 20 some odd hours...insurance is a good thing though!
363430,aplumma,2009-07-17 19:03:00,6896,glad you are ok you might drop a pm to bernie to see if he has any words of wisdom to salvage as much of the mechanical as possible.   Art
362999,brkygetr,2009-07-16 18:13:00,425,This is just a heads up too everyone that it can happen to you. I spent a cold/wet night a long way from anyone or anything. The only good part about this is that I was fine and luckily because I was prepared with a waterproof emergency kit and gear things turned out ok. This happened at 7:30 at night on Sunday eve and concludes about 4 in the afternoon on Monday. I think the pictures tell the story on their own.               
363006,Guest gbfisher,2009-07-16 18:20:00,0,Not the first time Ive seen that.......sucks either way... Nasty lesson.
363007,johnnyb,2009-07-16 18:20:00,3413,Doood.....that sucks...how did THAT...end up in THERE? btw..very glad to hear you are okay!
363008,Ziki,2009-07-16 18:22:00,128,were you drunk?
363009,sandmann,2009-07-16 18:22:00,51,Glad that your ok.  How did the truck get in the water?
363012,Guest gbfisher,2009-07-16 18:31:00,0,I'd say he missed the break......  Standard truck?
363018,Joey,2009-07-16 18:57:00,9122,"That certainly bites, glad you are okay.  Joey"
363021,richyb,2009-07-16 19:04:00,774,"ok im lost , whats the story behind that ?"
363022,fishnsled,2009-07-16 19:05:00,3520,Glad you are OK.  Looking at the pics I was trying to figure out what the red glow was in the water.  Then     I hope the repairs aren't too bad but a small price compared to what it could have been.
363023,fishermccann,2009-07-16 19:06:00,655,"I think an explanation is in order, come on all are wondering!!!!!  WHAT THE HELL!"
363024,Bigfisherman,2009-07-16 19:06:00,100,"That sucks dude, glad your ok, at first I thought you hit something with the boat until I saw the truck!"
363029,EvilCooke,2009-07-16 19:17:00,5,"That really sucks!  but like everyone has said, at least your OK.   can you explain what happened?"
363030,BillM,2009-07-16 19:19:00,17367,"Details, we need them."
363031,Twocoda,2009-07-16 19:21:00,4130,ouch !!! Hard knocks ......definitely no competition for that parking spot...  this isnt the first time i seen this type of situation though ...happens ALOT in Ipperwash from guys trying to launch off the beach ...
363038,SlowPoke,2009-07-16 19:42:00,2984,The tide came in? And I thought I had a bad weekend spending $1000 on my Tahoe only to have the diff blow on Monday... spent another $5000 on another vehicle today. I hope the damage is minimal and glad you were prepared. Need any full size chevy parts? LOL -Brian
363048,Paully,2009-07-16 20:05:00,712,LoL ...  that must suck!
363049,Twocoda,2009-07-16 20:05:00,4130,just thought of it ...ive got a sound 350 with tranny in the garage ...$ 400.00 you pick it up
363052,Dara,2009-07-16 20:14:00,3052,I'm guessing a standard and you counted on the parking brake because the tail pipe was under water to launch and when you got out it didn't hold. Either that or it just popped out of gear when you were getting the boat undone.  Bummer
363061,misfish,2009-07-16 20:29:00,29133,"WOW. Looking at the pic,s,the boat was still on the trailer,but unstraped at the stern.Explain the bow down and the stern popping straight up.  Is that the elephant man?  Like to hear what happen."
363070,quickme,2009-07-16 20:59:00,261,that is the craziest thing i've seen....   I'm glad to hear you are alright...  you can replace a truck but your life is a different story... on the bright side you'll always have this as a crazy story to tell your friends..
363076,brkygetr,2009-07-16 21:12:00,425,"well, you all pretty much got it...standard truck and popped out of gear while I was unhooking the boat...i was in the truck within seconds but the water was allready over my knees..exhaust under water by that point and no way it was gonna fire...not that it would have done any good cause at that point the ass of the truck was floating due to air under the box liner and the boat was pulling it out due to momentum...I jumped from the truck as the water was coming over the steering wheel, to the box and then onto the bow of the boat.....by the time I was standing on the floor of the boat I was looking down at the tip of my radio whip about 2 ft below the water and lots of nice bubbles  ... And this is where it gets really NASTY... My safety chain was still conected the the bow of the boat which just so happens to have a lock on it...guess where the freakin key was!!!! I could therefore not unhook the boat from the trailer. It floated for a while but eventually the weight of the truck pulled it down. By the way its hard to tell but I did swim out to the truck in the morning and when I stood on the roof of the truck my head was about 1 ft below the water...which is actually lucky as this particular lake is about 80 ft of water no more than twice the distance my truck was to shore. I tell ya its a damn good thing I live in Northwestern Ontario cause I doubt many outfits from back home would have shown up with a towtruck a pair of shorts and swimming goggles to get er' out...just like its any other day!!!! By the way the water was only 52 degrees..."
363089,Greencoachdog,2009-07-16 21:53:00,8163,Glad you're ok!... never be in too big of a hurry to launch!
