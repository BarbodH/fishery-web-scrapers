383595,TEP,2009-09-15 23:50:00,68,My neighbor dropped over and asked if I'd ever been there. (No) His pals say his Avalanche will get busted up if he tries to launch his boat(14' Legend). Anyone have any details where the launch is or how good is it?  Thanks
383608,darsky,2009-09-16 00:19:00,586,probably right.Have heard of people going in by tractor
383612,Harrison,2009-09-16 00:29:00,2202,"Hey bud, I have been in a few times before the ATV bridges were put it.  I took a Dakota and a Z71 in there.  It is a pretty tough 4x4, especially for the inexperienced,  There is a tractor that offers rides mostly to Americans which caused some major ruts.  There is also a creek to cross that covered the hood on the dakota one time. To be honest, its a pretty hammered lake nowadays.  Your bud may be better off picking another off the 'Backroads map"" and go from there.  JMO."
383627,TEP,2009-09-16 00:57:00,68,Thanks guys. Not what he's gonna want to hear.
383638,TJQ,2009-09-16 01:08:00,7806,Its rough on trucks that for sure.
383642,Lostchild,2009-09-16 01:14:00,153,"From the north road in he could do it easily....the only problem is there is no launch. Its a 600m portage to the water, basically canoe only."
383670,Skud,2009-09-16 02:03:00,739,What's wrong Jef? Not enough fish in your lake to catch?  Good to see you coming around here again. It's been so long Cupcake.
383725,Sinker,2009-09-16 04:05:00,8692,"I used to go in there every year, but nowadays, its not worth the hassle. You might get lucky and catch a few decent bass, but most of them are 12"" or less in there. The ride in is always fun though. We always did it in a 4wd pick up with no major problems. Just take 'er slow.  S."
383913,hirk,2009-09-16 19:45:00,571,"Jeff I drove my brand new f-150 4x4 in there back in 89 and no problem other than some scratches but I didn't find the fishing very good, even back then it got pounded.Tell him to pick a lake with good access around there,he may just find a jewel."
