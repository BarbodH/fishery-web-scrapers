383766,wask,2009-09-16 11:48:00,174,"http://fishinghistory.blogspot.com/2009/09...ived-world.html!    Crazy.  Would tie George Perry's record that has stood for 70 some years if it is counted as valid.  Was caught on a BlueGill.  The craziest part is that Japan considers bass an invasive species and is trying to rid their waters of them.  We'll see what happens, I don't know how you verify this record, especially from half way across the world more than two months after the fish was caught.  Either way, it can't match the mystique of Perry's catch, at least not in my opinion...  Here is a pic of Perry and his Bass (which I had forgotten existed)    Cool write up on Perry and his bass"
383810,chandru,2009-09-16 13:43:00,63,wait how did they verify Perry's catch? don't really know how this stuff works so i'm curious!
383812,oates,2009-09-16 13:48:00,151,So let Me understand this? They want to get rid of bass one of the most fun fish to catch so they can do what? Catch sunfish all day?
383823,wask,2009-09-16 14:24:00,174, Field and Stream was running a contest and it was verified by one of their officials from what I understand.
383848,Governator,2009-09-16 15:38:00,879,"This story didn't just circulate 2 months after it was caught.  It was all over the web and posted here almost immediately after.  Lets do some searchin'   EDIT: Well I can't find the post here, but here's the article I read from July:  http://hamptonroads.com/2009/07/japanese-a...re-world-record  "
383904,wask,2009-09-16 19:01:00,174,"Yeah, its two months old, but the last I had read on it was that they were not going to submit it for one reason or another for the record.  The application for the record was just filed yesterday I think."
383918,MCTFisher9120,2009-09-16 20:05:00,3761,We have our invasive species and they have theirs. Great catch regardless although the real record should be caught somewhere in America.
383974,danbouck,2009-09-16 22:38:00,4380,I thought the record was 24lbs from cali
384106,wask,2009-09-17 02:52:00,174,"That one was foul hooked, so they turned it loose since it wasn't caught 'legally'.  I think I read that fish turned up dead not too long ago, little fuzzy about that though  "
384130,Cudz,2009-09-17 04:10:00,2652,"The Japan fish is 1 ounce bigger than Perry's but to beat a world record the fish has to be 2 ounces bigger.  That is my understanding.  Therefore, it is considered a tie."
384139,wuchikubo,2009-09-17 05:53:00,1114, Japan has other native fish (like Ayu and some small trout species) that have better tasting fish and don't grow to large sizes. The bass are the invasive species.
384368,CLofchik,2009-09-17 22:28:00,854," It's just shocking how many ignorant, uninformed, downright backward & inbred anglers there are out there who just don't appreciate a good sunfish....errr bass.           "
384371,splashhopper,2009-09-17 22:31:00,2931,holy crap that bass is huuuuge ....
