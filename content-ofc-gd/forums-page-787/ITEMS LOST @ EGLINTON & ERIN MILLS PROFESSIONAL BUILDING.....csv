I was at the PROFESSIONAL BUILDING @ EGLINTON & ERIN MILLS in MISSISSAUGA on the 2nd floor - FOUND A WATCH AND A GOLD RING - By the looks of it, the ring was possibly a WEDDING RING (engraved on the insides)... Anyway, I flipped it over to my doctor on the same floor of where I found the jeweler.  He's gonna post some LOST SIGNS all over his floor....  I know my odds are slim - but I thought I'd give it a shot - I'd hate to be in this guys shoes right about now..."
