383355,Jay T,2009-09-15 11:47:00,282,"Looks like you got a few nice ones kickin around. I only have 2 1/2 weeks to go until I can get my bow out with me into the bush. Good luck this season, and stay safe.  Jay"
383378,LucG,2009-09-15 12:39:00,779,"Nice buck! Hopefully he will stick around and give you a shot. I've had some action this last couple weeks on my trail cam as well, but nothing that big yet."
383380,NAW,2009-09-15 12:41:00,4022,"Yes, that's getting me cranked for hunting season too."
383386,bushart,2009-09-15 12:52:00,2628,Looks good Rickster  Ya need to set up and shoot the buck that's gonna kick that fella's butt ya have in the pic---I know you've got some nice deer up your way.  Bushart
383522,misfish,2009-09-15 20:18:00,29133,"What camera are you using? That last buck has a nice rack,but looks a little skinny wouldnt ya say?  All nice shots.  6:25 AM It,s down."
383565,Leecher,2009-09-15 22:37:00,7832,Man I'm jealous....  you sure will have a hard choice to make come hunting time  There's some pretty bigguns in those pics!!! Keep us updated on the new arrivals rickster Leechman
383896,rickster,2009-09-16 18:26:00,495, Using a moultrie 4.0 with flash Flash doesn't seem to bother the deer got a couple more pics from the other night   
383905,Leecher,2009-09-16 19:04:00,7832,Nice rickster Do you have a feeder near by??  or are they just coming to this area all the time? Jacques
384054,rickster,2009-09-17 01:03:00,495,I put out some cracked corn every 3-4 days I saw a pic of a homemade feeder made out of sewer pipe (actually similar to the one misfish has) gonna try it this year to see how it works just got home from my  hunting area (only  about ten minute drive) and have a few more pics from last night but they are of the same two bucks hoping something bigger decides to show up but that wide nine point is looking like he may be the one this year pretty sure he still has some growing left in him for a year or two though  Rick
384057,Leecher,2009-09-17 01:10:00,7832, Cool Rick!!!  Heck he may grow another point or two by the time hunting season starts LOL You got yourself a great setup there  Keep them pics coming..... I love seeing them big boys Jacques
384070,misfish,2009-09-17 01:23:00,29133,"Dont use crack corn Rick. After I used it the first time,I was told it turns into a big clump in thier bellies(hard to dijest).Hole corn is better. Going to hit the store in the AM and pic up another trail cam.My feeder has had alot of action. Lots of good imprints. Ones got to be the big one, as the imprint is very large.   Very nice looking bucks."
384078,rickster,2009-09-17 01:41:00,495, And I heard it the other way that whole corn is hard to digest i am sure we all know what happens after we eat corn on the cob? Gonna have to do some more research  hope you have a good one coming to the feed  by the way how is the pipe feeder working?
384236,misfish,2009-09-17 15:24:00,29133,Refilling every third day.Im off to it after work.
384239,LucG,2009-09-17 15:26:00,779,Last year I caught a few quads taking a joy ride on my property. I will post the pic if I can find it. Maybe they can be identified...lol  I'm glad they didnt take the cam.
