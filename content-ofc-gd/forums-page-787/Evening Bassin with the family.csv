383243,uglyfish,2009-09-15 02:18:00,981,"Hey all, hows everyone doin? awesome, ok... went out to the bay today for a walk, and brought a couple rods with me so me and my gf could fish a bit while we were there. now, she has had a tough time this year catchin anythin other then gobies lol. and i kept promising to get her into some better fish. namely, largies and pike cause well, those are her favorite fish. i went with one rod forcing myself to use one technique, a 7 inch texas rigged powerworm. never used it before, but wanted to learn it and use it more, figured it can help in my tournaments at some point lol. she used a senko cause well... she dont really know how to use much else and that one is pretty simple and catches fish. haha.  ok, onto business... i stopped at a dock when we first got there and tossed a few cast around, knowing there was fish around the dock. it was just too perfect, it always holds ample forage in bluegills, perch, punpkinseed and gobies, as well as many young of the year bass.  so, few casts start feeling the tugs of the smaller fish, then happen to see a bigger largemouth come out and look at the worm... then slowly eat it inch by inch lol, once i seen he had it, stuck him and landed the first of the day. nuthin major but it was a fish.    then, i let the little guy take a look at him.    we moved along the shore line lookin for some other spots, as i know there are some overhanging trees and sunken logs that usually hold fish. once we got to the sunken logs we began casting them and workin the baits back to shore, kept gettin a TON of bites, but most we smaller fish, gobies, perch, small bass. they kept gettin the tail of my powerworm but each time i tried to set the hook i just ended up pulling the worm down the hook. after some persistance and a few curse words, i managed my second largie of the day.    after that, i was schooled by the little lady. she put on a clinic with the senko. she would just cast if out, let it fall, deadstick it, if she got nuthin, just reeled in, and cast it back out. she hooked up with her first bass and landed it.    after a few more casts and one breakoff by yours truely, we moved down to another sunken log and began casting that, well... i made 2 casts on a log and said, ""here hun, u take this one, ill try that spot over there."" guess how that turned out for me?? lots of little hits and missed strikes by stupid little fish just nipping at the tail... oh, and while i was doin all that... she was busy catchin this...    then she landed this...    her bass were all caught on a wacky rigged senko, perch included lol. mine were on a 7inch texas rigged berkley powerworm in a purple/red color. was a great nite to be out and go for a walk, get some exercise and catch a few fish.  if ya have a couple hours to kill... take ur kids fishing... u might catch a fish... but you'll always catch a memory.

383316,kpm2k,2009-09-15 04:15:00,4,"Awesome man!  Oh wow at least she touches the fish, I cant get the wife to even put on her own worms yet.    Maybe gotta get her some gloves!!"
383326,uglyfish,2009-09-15 05:13:00,981,"lol KPM, actually it took a while to get her to put the worms on... i really forced the issue cause i was tired of stopping my fishing to put a new worm on haha.  but shes good with the fish now, as long as she can lip them. but she wont handle anythin with teeth lol."

383715,chandru,2009-09-16 03:24:00,63,"hey man any tips on how to get ur GF more interested in fishing? my girl likes it but only when she catches fish, its seems hard to get her to actually want to go! of course i'm addicted, and i would love it if she could develop the same addiction! lol"
383736,uglyfish,2009-09-16 05:13:00,981,"lol i dunno man, my girl is pretty understanding of my obsession, lol. my last gf actually broke up with me in part cause of my fishing habits haha. this girl is great, she always liked fishing, but shes happy just being out, takin the kids out, she likes to catch fish, but knows its not always the most important part of goin. i just got lucky i guess!"
