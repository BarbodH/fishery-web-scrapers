382826,jediangler,2009-09-14 01:37:00,1923,"My buddy rigged his own motor mount for his Sportspal. He used stainless steel and wood for it and it is removable by pulling two pins. This is the only pic I could find to show it.  Here is the same boat (side view) with a 240lb guy at the back and a 180lb guy in the front.  With the battery, motor, fishing gear and the lunch they brought, that boat is pretty close to carrying 500lbs in this pic."
382869,Dabluz,2009-09-14 03:47:00,701,"  Sorry....I have no photo right now but I can get you one for tomorrow night.  I use the original motor mount that comes with the Sportspal canoe.  I'm very sure you can buy one anywhere Sportspals are sold.  It's clamped in place with and tightened with wing nuts.  You will find that a 30 lb thrust electric motor is too fast for trolling....even at the lowest speed setting.  My 9 lb thrust was a bit too fast too.  I sold it for 50 bucks and bought a new 32 lb thrust motor for 60 bucks.  I regret selling the old 9 lb thrust but the 32 lb thrust is perfect for my 12 foot aluminum boat.  Yes, the 11 foot Sportspal has very limited space so you really have to skimp on what equipement you want to take aboard.....especially with a partner.  Here where I live, there are very few large bodies of water....it's all small lakes and ponds and 99% of the fishing is for brook trout.  Everybody up here has a canoe.  I never see any 11 foot Sportspals anymore.  The 14 foot (actually less than 14 feet) weighs about 10 lbs more.  When I bought my Sportspal, the square back version had not yet been invented but I don't regret it.  The square back version is a bit shorter and heavier and you still have the motor directly behind you.  I remember that for the first few years, Sportspal canoes in my region were rare.  People's eyes really popped out when they saw me lift the canoe directly off the ground and walk with the canoe with upraised arms.  For portaging the 11 foot Sportspal, there is a way to cross the oars so they act as a yoke that fits on your shoulders.  I even remember that each of the oars had a small hole so that they could be bolted together while they are fitted tight inside the canoe when portaging.  I used to do a lot of portaging but not as much these last few years.....I'm 62.  But 10 years ago, it was nothing for me to portage for 8 to 10 hours to get to some remote lakes and spend the night camping and then coming back out the next day.  I could carry everything I needed and not have to go back and forth carrying equipement overland.  However, there was no question of me bringing back any added weight.....like fish.  I used 2 paddles tied lengthwise inside the canoe to form a yoke.  The rod cases could be tied inside the canoe and bulky items like extra clothes and sleeping bag could be stuffed into the compartments at each end of the canoe.  The Sportspal canoe is a Canadian invention.  I remember my dad buying an 11 foot Sportspal when I was a kid.  He paid 119 dollars for it.  I think that the 14 foot model did not exist then.  It had a darker bark colour and I think that the aluminum was 1 piece....therefore no leaks.  I'm pretty sure there was no keel either.  Not much fun to paddle alone and that's why there were oars.  You pushed forward when using the oars."
383096,splashhopper,2009-09-14 21:40:00,2931, Do u think your buddy could send me some instructions via email to make that motormount? Pm me if he can....  Thanks  Splashhopper
383372,jediangler,2009-09-15 12:26:00,1923,"He's not in the computer age just yet. He finally got a cellphone last week. If I can get him out fishing again, he's only been out 4 times this year, I'll take some better photos of his mount and get them to you. It won't be this weekend but maybe next."
383550,Dabluz,2009-09-15 21:55:00,701,I'm pretty sure that there are lots of instructions on how to make a motor mount the internet.  I still say that the fastest and easiest way is just to buy one anywhere Sportspals are sold.
383553,splashhopper,2009-09-15 22:04:00,2931,No worries on the motor mount pics guys...  I just found an OEM one locally for $34.00  Thank you
383555,Dutchy,2009-09-15 22:08:00,416," Sheesh, I am not THAT big, maybe 250lbs. Its more my height that will be the issue...........  And don't worry, if you fall in, I won't let you drown donkey"
383563,splashhopper,2009-09-15 22:31:00,2931, Maybe?.... 
383589,danbouck,2009-09-15 23:39:00,4380,Did you happen to get it from Owen Sound?
383635,Dabluz,2009-09-16 01:02:00,701,  I doubt you could even make one at that price.  (What does OEM mean?)
383683,John Bacon,2009-09-16 02:35:00,3277, Usually means Original Equipment Manufacturer.
383754,splashhopper,2009-09-16 10:23:00,2931, Nope... locally... I sent an email to his store and a clerk called me back saying they didn't have any... a couple hours later the owner of the store called me and said he had one collecting dust in the back room... the clerk didn't know about it I guess .... I am picking it up on Thursday...   Original Equipment Manufacturer
384369,splashhopper,2009-09-17 22:29:00,2931,  Picked it up from Brian this afternoon @ Ships Ahoy Marine in Sparta  Also grabbed some 3m 5200 sealant too
384465,Rizzo,2009-09-18 03:35:00,4754,"holy good deal! I just stopped at some guy's house on the way home from work because he had a small canoe (aluminum) for sale for 50.00. Thing was a total piece of crap, looks like it bounced around on the freeway for an afternoon, actually quite funny how crushed and crumpled it was...either way I was going to buy it because what can you get for 50? Apparently a sportspal, I better check kijiji before I buy the smashed up popcan canoe"
382572,splashhopper,2009-09-13 02:03:00,2931,"wooo hooo..... Kijiji has been berry berry good 2 meeeeee lately..  In the last two weeks I have bought: 1) Motor-guide 36lb thrust trolling motor .. barely used 2) 12v Energizer deep cycle battery... had to clean up the terminals 3) Schumacher 2-10 V charger..  Sub-total: $140.00  Today I bought an 11ft Sportspal canoe Paid $50.00  Grand total...  $190.00 !  I didn't realize how small an 11 foot canoe really is until I went to strap it on the roof of my Grand Caravan.... holy crap... thank goodness I had some long bungee cords in the van already from work...   We took the little canoe out to the local pond for a test run before we take it up to  ""Spinnerbait country"" tomorrow am.  After a bit of fiddling and farting around.... I got the electric motor rigged up and my buddy in the front..  Off we went... he has never fished top-water before and definitely not ""the slop"".... lol  I headed straight to it and rigged him up with my favorite: a Black Scum frog  I was having a bit of a challenge getting used to the side mount for the motor and he was learning how to fish top-water...  As we got closer to the slop, I headed us toward shore and some overhanging trees  He tossed hi frog in and within  a few casts.. he was getting some action... he was excited... I told him I thought the big frogs were chasing his frog  And that he would ""KNOW"" when a large-mouth bass hit his top-water frog ...  I finally got a chance to fish and about 10 casts in..... KAPOW... HUUUGE HIT.... AND i SET THE HOOK  My PB largemouth >>>    All that we had was a camera phone.... but hey.... it's a pretty good photo for the pressure we were under...lol We estimated the fish at or near 5 lbs based on its length of 21"" and girth the same size as my PB smallie from last weekend.... i really need to get a digital scale... it's getting kinda nuts lately with some of the fish I have been VERY FORTUNATE to catch the last 2-3 weeks.   Tomorrow morning we are headed back out with the little canoe.... gonna test it out on a larger conservation area.  The canoe has a very small leak in it... no biggie... I will check it over next week and re-seal the joints.... maybe even add a bolt or two to it for easier tie downs...and secure a short piece of 2x4 to the side to mount the motor...  All in all... I am one very happy consumer of stuff from Kijiji so far... Now If I could just get rid of some of my own stuff on there,... my wife would be happy too  Splashhopper"
382575,SRT8 smoker craft,2009-09-13 02:11:00,1107,Nice bucket splash and good deal on the new ride !!!
382578,Jonny,2009-09-13 02:17:00,1380,"Fifty bucks and only a small leak?  You done good, man!"
382580,splashhopper,2009-09-13 02:22:00,2931, Yep.... and my buddy that has a 14 Sportspal just called and is gonna help me find the leak and fix it like he did with his 5 years ago and it has never leaked since.... Lucky me......
382584,Jonny,2009-09-13 02:32:00,1380,I had a 14 ft square-stern Sportspal for many years. I bought it new but it eventually developed a small leak in it that I never did find. It would ship maybe a couple of quarts in a morning's duck hunting. Never did bother us much.  For certain boating/access conditions there's nothing better than a Sportspal --- light and very stable.
382585,scugpg,2009-09-13 02:34:00,1373,Nice score! I was thinking of a jon boat but want to check out a transom sportspal to put an electric on. Maybe we'll see you on the water sometime around here!
382587,Jonny,2009-09-13 02:49:00,1380," Just a word of advice - don't pass up a V-stern like Splash got. With the kind of wood mount he's talking about, an electric will mount just fine on a Vee. Actually it can be a little easier because you don't have to reach directly behind you."
382588,TJQ,2009-09-13 02:50:00,7806,tHOSE ARE GREAT SCORES... NICE!
382590,snag,2009-09-13 03:02:00,1932,Sweet score.  I bought one years ago that is stashed at lake X.  It has a bunch of holes that a flashlight and silicon has a date with one day.   Nice reward too!

382622,Dabluz,2009-09-13 05:30:00,701,"I've been fishing from Sportspals for close to 50 years now.  Those 11 foot ones are a bit like a bath tub but they only weigh about 20 lbs.  I bought a 14 foot (pointed at both ends) over 30 years ago and have used it on an average of 60 times a year for fishing and hunting.  I paid about 300 for it.  It no longer has any foam on each side (too many portages through spruce forests) but I still have one good foam seat with a back and a couple of foam seats with no backs.  It weighs less than 30 lbs.  I prefer the pointed Sportspals because the side mount makes using a small outboard or an electric motor much easier.  It's also easier to paddle.  I had a Minn Kota 15 electric motor for a good 25 years.  This motor developped about 9 lbs of thrust and I could clip along at close to 5 km/h at top speed yet at low speed, it was perfect for trolling walleye (slow).  At low speed, the little electric motor consumed about 4 amps.  This means that a 200 reserve minute battery was good for 30 hours of constant trolling.  50 dollars is a crime.  The canoe is worth 4 times that amount.  It's real easy to make a side mount for the canoe.  You can even add an extension on the other side to mount a sonar transducer.  I used suction mount transducer.  You can even make a double side mount with an electric motor on one side and a small gas engine on the other side.  You can't beat a Sportspal for silent fishing.  The foam interior is great.<  Ok, the Sportspal is not streamlined but it's wide and stable.  If you ever run into waves, shift the weight towards the middle of the canoe.  This will enable the ends of the canoe to lift at ever wave.  All Sportspals leak a bit.  It's due to the stuff they use at the joints.  It's junk.  One day about 20 years ago, I lent my Sportspal to a friend.  He punctured it with a branch.  Anyway, I patched the hole with adhesive metal tape that is used to repair mufflers.  The repair still holds today.  I have painted my old Sportspal.  It was once birch bark coloured and is now spray painted dark green with black and brown to make a camouflage colour.  Did you notice the hole in the front of the canoe?  This was to convert the canoe into a sailboat.  The original side mount was used with the tiller unit.  I think the oar locks were also used when a sail was mounted.  Your low profile and a silent approach will allow you to almost get on top of the fish."
382634,Greencoachdog,2009-09-13 11:26:00,8163,That fish looks like a real nice...          3 pounder!
382652,smally21,2009-09-13 12:54:00,993,good for you - i love kijiji! too many cheapos out there when you sell stuff (find a 50$ canoe and offer the guy 40$  ) but for buying stuff it cant be beat. whole house full of appliances and a dynamite wood shop to boot off kijiji for about 30 cents on the dollar.  nice to cap it off with great fish too!
382755,splashhopper,2009-09-13 21:34:00,2931,"I was actually thinking of knocking him down $10.000 too!  lol  At that price... let him have a case and half of beer for it...lol  ...  I went out on it today and caught a half dozen fish.... 4 decent smallies and two good sized crappies...  i get back to the van and discover I have lost one of the foam pads to put under it on the roof of the van. ( the ones i borrowed from my friend last night   )  As the fishing gods would have it.... the guy that came in to shore right behind me with his canoe offered me one for free,,, I said: ""how about I give you $10.00 for all four"" ?  I got those too..  Now I just need to buy my own life jackets for my daughter and i.....     "
382757,splashhopper,2009-09-13 21:53:00,2931,"Took a pic of my ""new canoe"" this morning....    It is definitely small when loaded ( 11 ft).... ( that's my buddy in the front with his SUITCASE )  lol  But hey... I have already caught 7 fish in it in less than 18 hours.... lol  The canoe has a leak or two in it.... big whoopie...  Now I just need to find out where it is and learn how to seal em up from my other buddy that owns an old Sporstpal too   ...."
382764,splashhopper,2009-09-13 22:28:00,2931,"Hi Dubluz:  By any chance have you got a pic of the side mount for your Sportspal.... I too think it will be a helluva lot easier to use the trolling motor at the side than behind my back.... How far out did you put the mount from the side of the canoe ?  I am using the battery box as a seat right now... works great so far... and all my body parts are still intact  I was wondering what that hole up front was for...( My buddy has eye-bolts in his and uses it to for his tie-downs.)  I just discovered that putting the straps criss-crossed over the middle of canoe on my van's roof rack works WAY BETTER than securing the ends down . I still put a bungee chord at each end though  I think I will put a roll of that muffler tape in the back of my van for emergency repairs while I am away.  Any particular method of washing the built up grunge off? I was thinking of some TSP and a good scrub brush.  How much weight can the canoe hold... one of my buddies is built the size of Shrek... and kinda talks like him too!  Thanks for the heads up on the "" wave control""... so far I haven't had that worry, but I know that will come soon enough.  Splashhopper   "
382772,splashhopper,2009-09-13 22:43:00,2931,Looking forward to it.... or we can go for a tour on my new ride! ... lol  u better not be too big though 
382790,Weeds,2009-09-13 23:34:00,782,"Nice score; I got mine for 50 bucks too, I think it's the same size as yours although mine is not as nice looking as yours. I don't have the foam on the side although mine didn't leak. It does now, not enough to worry about though, probably a couple cups an hour."
382791,scugpg,2009-09-13 23:36:00,1373," I totally agree, but was looking at a Minnkota Maxxum motor for it, they're 30lbs so it's quite a bit over the side."
382792,splashhopper,2009-09-13 23:42:00,2931, I hooked up my Motorguide 36 lb thrust on the side of it...creates quite the wake.... the only problem is that it sits too close to the canoe the way I had it rigged...  I need to sort out an arm off the side of some sorts....  Hoping Dabluz has a photo or some one else does that has a side mounted trolling motor on their canoe...  We were a little pressed for space this am on it so we decided to paddle  i sure wished i had the trolling motor on it in the wind on the way back...
382793,splashhopper,2009-09-13 23:43:00,2931,  How low does yours sit in the water with two guys and their gear in it?
382815,kickingfrog,2009-09-14 01:14:00,8333, In a lot of cases it's not so much how much he weighs but what he does with it. I'd rather have a 300lb bag of nails in my canoe then some 120lb gunwale grabber.  The state of the foam would play a large role in the ability of the boat to give you free board.  I would think you could find some info on the net to give you some ideas.
382820,Weeds,2009-09-14 01:17:00,782,It's been awhile since I've had 2 people in it but If I remember correctly it didn't sit alarmingly low or anything. I guess it probably depends on the size of the two guys and how much gear we are talking about. According to this website capacity is 500 pounds. http://www.bwmarineproducts.com/sportspal.htm
382825,danbouck,2009-09-14 01:33:00,4380,Shrek and Donkey will be fine in it.
