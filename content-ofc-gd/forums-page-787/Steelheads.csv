384212,justin elia,2009-09-17 14:40:00,151,There hasn't been any rain in almost 3 weeks.  Wait for a good cold rain in October and fish should start coming in.
384255,12footspringbok,2009-09-17 16:12:00,459,I'd be willing to bet there will be a few around this weekend. Supposed to get some cold nights the next few days. I'll be alternating casting for salmon and floating for bows this weekend.

384330,Dutchy,2009-09-17 20:29:00,416, Would seem to make sense.   Which is what I will hopefully be doing this weekend at some point. Will let you know if anything should appear............
