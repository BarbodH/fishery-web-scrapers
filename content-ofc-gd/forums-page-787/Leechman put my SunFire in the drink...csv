383554,Leecher,2009-09-15 22:07:00,7832,  Yes you may joke about it Jim It wasn't funny when it happen but like I said in my first reply.... after driving a few kilometers we sure did have a good laugh about it  Jacques
383591,Greencoachdog,2009-09-15 23:41:00,8163,"Jacques!... Paul!... one of y'all get a cell phone so you can call Kevin's little gimlet   to come pull you out!!!... I could use the ""alone"" time with Stephanie yanno!!!"
383592,Leecher,2009-09-15 23:43:00,7832, OK Glen..... Sounds like a plan   :lol:
383603,scuro2,2009-09-16 00:05:00,904," Okay so the car is stuck up on that rock. And you can't figure a way to get it down. The two of you go off to get help, walk 2km and leave the car for at least an hour or two. What I kept on thinking about last night is what if someone came during that time when you were off to get help? How would they react, here is a car with the hood and trunk open, what would they think?"
383605,Whitespinnerbait,2009-09-16 00:11:00,2038,Its a Man Made / Home Made  Launch at Lake X.......No one around for Miles..No cell phone service..
383630,Cudz,2009-09-16 01:01:00,2652,"Man, stuff like this happens all the time.  I have done way worse than that on the water and trying to get boats out as well. My favourite part might be the fact that this is the second time this has happened to you.  lol."
383217,Joey,2009-09-15 01:54:00,9122,"Oh man, that's one of the funniest things I seen in awhile.  Don't think you'll be living this one down for quite some time Jaques  Hope the car has no long term problems after this.  Nice heron pic  Joey"
383232,Whitespinnerbait,2009-09-15 02:11:00,2038,    I too have been there done that....    
383236,ohhenrygsr,2009-09-15 02:13:00,947,"Yea it really sucks when that happens.  Been there done that but i got CAA to come pull my rig out.  My problem was the Ebrake stuck and front tires sunk into the gravel, it wasn't pretty. So once we got the van out of the lake i still had the trailer and boat.  As i put the boat back on the trailer my winch decided to break on me and so did my rope to winch the boat on.  But i was lucky to have enough teeth left on the winch to put the boat on the trailer so that the tow truck could haul out my trailer.  Oh yea if you experience any of your gauges reading wrong you need to unplug it and blow out all the water really good and seal it with some di-electric grease or you will have problems down the road.  GM + water = nono.  It's a scaring experience as i thought this lil adventure would cost me a lot but it didn't at all.  NOTE: ALWAYS USE A PAVED LAUNCH FROM NOW ON!!"
383238,bigugli,2009-09-15 02:15:00,6138,"We all get to have ""one of them days"" every so often. A little while from now you'll laugh it off."
383242,scuro2,2009-09-15 02:17:00,904," I have to ask, why is the trunk open? Looks like someone was torturing the poor thing and taking it's innards out any which way they could. By the way, I gotta say you caught the reflection of the car beautifully in the setting sun. Had we seen that pink water under the car we would know that the picture was a photoshopped hoax."
383250,Mike the Pike,2009-09-15 02:22:00,3421, I really hope after all that you guys had 2 cold beers for all that work.  Have a good evening Spongebob.  MTP
383252,Greencoachdog,2009-09-15 02:24:00,8163,   It really SUX to be you eh!???
383258,wask,2009-09-15 02:27:00,174," Lol, I never let anyone else do it because I can't be held responsible for my reaction if something goes wrong.... lol."
383264,jaydub,2009-09-15 02:28:00,145,"Ok, that's definitely one of the best fishing stories I've heard  ...and I'm sure you and Jacques think so to now that it's all said and done!  I was wondering how many posts before Jacques came to his own defense with ""the real"" story.  Hope the car's ok Paul!  BTW, get a truck already! lol"
383273,Mike the Pike,2009-09-15 02:38:00,3421,Paul have you considered one of these vehicles for your next purchase??      
383278,fishnsled,2009-09-15 02:43:00,3520,"Could have been worst, change all the fluids and hopefully you'll be OK.  Some nice fish and love the Heron shots.  Mike may have some good suggestions as to your next vehicle....."
383292,Jonny,2009-09-15 02:55:00,1380,Kinda looks like you parked the car and went fishing and when you got back the tide was in.
383293,ohhenrygsr,2009-09-15 02:56:00,947, LOl he had to get the jack out.
383294,trout-eater,2009-09-15 02:58:00,21,"hahahaha  i remember lurking here a while ago and i also noticed the same fishing report, just like Muskymatt said.  at first i thought somebody dug up an old report, but nope this happened again!!!!!!!!!!!!!     that is the funniest thing i've seen in a while.   Loved the report!!  oh and people at work were crying when i showed them this, but they Lost it when told them you've done it before, and with pictures to prove it!!  too funny!!"
383303,scuro2,2009-09-15 03:11:00,904,Is it just me or does the side panelling looked a little worse for the wear?
383305,ohhenrygsr,2009-09-15 03:21:00,947,  WHY HAVE ONE OF THOSE WHEN YOU CAN HAVE ONE OF THESE  
383307,CLofchik,2009-09-15 03:26:00,854," LOL, it's a Sunfire he just jacked off a boulder with pieces from an old dock he found laying around, I don't think it's lived a babied life.  Hell the only advantage to having a Sunfire is that your buddy can do his best to drown the thing and it really doesn't bother you that much Heck he may have trying to do you a favour in giving you an excuse to upgrade!"

383368,Jack-of-all-fish,2009-09-15 12:12:00,53,"Heck, you guys were lucky that the MNR or OPP didn't ticket you for life jackets and safety equipment infractions!!"
383494,Abraxus,2009-09-15 18:37:00,104,Dude! That's the second time you have put that sunfire under water!  I think it spends more time in the lake then your boat! lol  That sucks!  Sorry for your troubles.  Ab
383506,Fishing 24/7,2009-09-15 19:27:00,709,  Thats some funny crap right there! HAHAHAHAHHAAH!
383524,DanD,2009-09-15 20:20:00,2223,"As Forest would say; it happens. Most of the electronics in the car should be OK; they’re likely high enough not to have got wet; plus the powertrain control module (computer) that's inside the right front inner fender is supposedly sealed. Supposedly LOL If it’s running ok; it’ll likely be alright. But the air bag module is located under the carpeting, under the passenger’s front seat and it’s not sealed; not against that much water, anyway. Water and electronics can make for some strange things to happen and I would hate to hear that one or both bags blew off while you’re driving down the road. Even if it does dry out without any issues now; I’d still be concerned about the rust and corrosion that will begin forming inside the module. I would be disabling the system, by unplugging the module or better yet replacing the module to make sure its going to work; if it were needed. It would be one heck of a wakeup call if the bags decided to blow on their own or just as bad, if not worse; they didn't during an accident. Air bags come out of their package with about a 500 pound punch; which will destroy the steering wheel, dash, possibly the windshield and your face, if it hits you. I’m not saying this will happen but it could and I just thought I would give you something to think about.  Dan."
383531,lookinforwalleye,2009-09-15 20:45:00,4399,  I hope your car is okay but you know that probably would not have happened if you had a real tow vehicle. Having said that looking at my gas bills I can see why some people try to skimp on a tow vehicle.
383543,Radnine,2009-09-15 21:28:00,1538, I sure hope we are allowed to joke about this topic 'cause it's hilarious. (with all due respect) Jim
383043,Whitespinnerbait,2009-09-14 19:51:00,2038,"Saturday afternoon Leechman and I were Bassin for a couple of hours .It was a Beautiful day out enjoying Nature..   Three of the 7 loons that were schooled up together       A Juvenile Green Heron was also out fishing for Perch...    Success..     All good things come to an end , at 6:30pm we call it a day ....Thats when all hell brakes loose..  Jacques offered to back the car and trailer in the water while I took the boat for a quick spin...How far do I back it in he asks...  I reply ..  When the tires are just below the surface....as i'm pulling away from the shore i look back...He thought I was refering to the tires on the car....   Whoaaaaaaa....  He panics we he realizes the water is coming in by the rear doors and puts the car in forward and drives  over a large boulder ...Six feet in diameter 18 inches high...  The car is now hung by the frame with both Passenger side tires out of the water...   Back seat...    While coming up to a stop sign one of running shoes floated up between my feet..     We had walked two kilometers to the nearest farmhouse for help , when we got there a sign on the door read  '' Gone Moose Hunting  ''...........   Back to the Sunfire we go and ended up jacking the car on large planks from and old dock nearby , then prying the car off the Boulder ...and away we went ..2and a half hours later..."
383045,backbay,2009-09-14 19:55:00,773,Unbelievable! I won't ask what Jacques catches when he goes ice fishing!!
383047,LucG,2009-09-14 19:57:00,779,Sorry to hear about your bad luck! Hopefully there isnt any serious damage.  But did you catch any fish?
383048,NAW,2009-09-14 19:59:00,4022,Wups..  You wont let that one down will you!!  I wouldn't
383051,blaque,2009-09-14 20:03:00,2419,"Dude? Im looking at pictures of the event, and still cant explain what is going on here LOL. What exactly did you do?   I dont even see a dock or launch in the pic."

383057,bigfish1965,2009-09-14 20:11:00,3382,Never let a guy named Jaques drive your car...lol.

I feel bad for both of you, Jacques was just trying to help!  I've had a couple of mishaps like that with people trying to help, and is the reason no one touches the boat or truck when I launch! I can do it quicker and easier by myself!   On a lighter note, I really like the Heron/Perch pic!!!"

Anybody here that has never had a mishap is a (Non teller of truths)  Hope the car dries out soon man----just be thankful it was'nt a Ford  Bushart
383094,Radnine,2009-09-14 21:38:00,1538," I usually don't let Jacques swamp my car, so I'm no expert, but aren't you supposed to take your shoes and socks off and put them in a dry place? Jim"
383129,SRT8 smoker craft,2009-09-14 23:16:00,1107,If it makes you feel any better I left my 06 magnum in reverse and walked back to pull the boat out and the car almost run me down by the time I got back in and stopped it I had water up to my feet above the gas pedal and the rear end was floating so I just had to sit there with it running while a guy unhooked his boat to pull me out. I don't rush at boat ramps any more thats for sure doesn't matter how many guys are behind me .I got mine all dried out and cleaned up with no damage at all but it took awhile to dry out completely like someone else said crap happens.
383132,Whitespinnerbait,2009-09-14 23:22:00,2038,  The only dry place left in the car was maybe the sunvisors....

383166,Mike the Pike,2009-09-15 00:33:00,3421, Now that was really funny Brian my coca cola almost came flying out of my nose bahahahahahaha.  Seriously I hope your car is going to be OK Paul .I hope it will not smell of mildew for the rest of its life.  Now we know Jacques is feeling really bad like others said he was just trying to help. Crap Happens.  Jacques you can come out of hiding buddy its ok.You sure did put out the fire on the sun  Now go fishing and send us some pics.
383172,Leecher,2009-09-15 00:56:00,7832,"Ummmm OK.... somehow I knew this was coming Now I really feel much better about this  Here is what went down just before I was drop on shore to get the Sunfire.... I recall Paul saying to back her up towards where he let me off, to the right of the launch and that is what I did.....   but this launch have seen the Sunfire before without any glitches.  When we go out fishing, I always go get the car and back it up for Paul so he can get the boat on the trailer and never had any problems so far until then.  This time I was 12"" too much on the right..... the launch, if you want to call it that, is very shallow and to get to boat off the trailer or onto it, the car needs to be backed into a couple of feet of water.  This time I backed the car in the same spot as usual but while I was backing up I saw the trailer jump a couple of times and not paying attention to it much..... should of pulled out and re positioned it but once I hit the breaks, I hear Paul yell ""BACK UP"" so I proceeded to hit the throttle but what  I didn't know was the back tire on the right hand side was just sitting flush on the front a big rock...... and once I got over it..... heard a big THUMP and that was that   The frame of the car on the rear right was sitting on top of this big rock  Then I hear Paul yell ""BACKUP"" ""BACKUP""   but there was no way the car would budge off So Paul got the boat off the trailer and went to shore.... when he got close to the car he said ""DONT TURN IT OFF"" so I sat in the driver seat while Paul unpinned the trailer, he tried to jack it up off the rock with the car jack.  Tried to drive off while jacked but this attempt was unsuccessful and got the front end to dig deeper..... I then saw smoke coming off the front of the hood..... so Paul said to pop the hood up..... I then hear ""TURN IT OFF"".  At this point Paul thought the motor overheated and the rad was leaking.... not good news at all    so we decided to walk to the property owners house that was 2KMs away, when we got there, like Paul mentioned, nobody home...... THEN WHAT.....  We were in a no cell phone zone and could not call for help...  so we proceeded to go back and try to get the car out..... by then it was pitch dark.... got our flash lights and started to look for some piece of lumber.... we found a couple of 2""x 8s"" and started to jack the right side....  got it high enough to slip one piece of lumber under the right front wheel and positioned the other piece under the frame to try and pry it off the rock.... we were successful in prying the car frame off the top of the rock so we wanted to do the same on the left but while I was cranking the jack down.... it broke  Paul popped the hood up again and was looking to see if the rad was leaking.... It turned out that when the front of the car sunk a few inches deeper, the fan was slightly submerged in water causing it to throw water into the rad and hence the smoke....... boy o boy that was good news!!!  Then Paul sat down in the driver's seat, started the car and put it reverse.... got it back far enough that when he put it in forward, drove right off onto dry land  Was I ever happy to see the car off shore Then we had to get the trailer out by hand and pin it to the hitch of the car....  Paul repositioned the rig, stopped and got out of the car and said ""OK JACQUES..... PART TWO"" backed the car out some more and got the boat onto the trailer and the rest is history.  We still had a good day out on the water and after driving a few kilometers we had a good laugh about it.... we weren't in any real danger but the though of seeing the car in that position and in water somehow just did not make sense.  For those that ask if we caught fish.... read my report... it has all the specifics and pics of the day. Jacques"
