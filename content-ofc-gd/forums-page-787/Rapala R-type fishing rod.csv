383199,fish-miester,2009-09-15 01:30:00,864,"yeah , i ended up buying the 7'2 R-type for flippin light jigs.. as of right now im liking it"
383210,MCTFisher9120,2009-09-15 01:42:00,3761,"  Nice man, I held a few of those. Man at the Lindsay CT they have a lot of fishing stuff...like it's unreal everything from carrot sticks to compre rods ...very impressed. Got any reals for sale...lol j/k pm me for a starter reel if u got 1 i might need to save up some but hey money's money."
383271,Dabluz,2009-09-15 02:37:00,701,  I suggest a Shimano CiticaE baitcaster for your rod.  This is the 2009 model of the Citica and it's about as close to a CuradoE that you can find but for 100 dollars less than the CuradoE.
383366,MCTFisher9120,2009-09-15 12:10:00,3761,"If I had the cash I would jump on that reel but I may need to spend a little less and go for the Daiwa Megaforce it's about 30 bucks less and well it's less money. We will need to wait and see what the holiday time brings me for spending money  Looking to put 20(or maybe 30lb braid) on it and my main goal for this combo is to use it for jigs around lighter cover, buzzbaits, texas rigg's in weeds, jerkbaits for pike and small musky and the odd use i may find for it.  Any reviews on the Megaforce?  Sorry for stiring up the thread again bro."
383382,fish-miester,2009-09-15 12:46:00,864,hey mike.. honestly i dont mind at all.. um and as for reels i had some good ones for sale.. but litteraly sold them probably 3 days ago.. had a rick clunn combo for 50$ but shes gone now. as well as a pfluger president for pretty cheap.. but that was the past .. as of right now i dont have anything .. but i will ask my buddies.. cuz well why pay full price when u can pay about half ? lol  Are you a righty or a lefty ?
383385,fish-miester,2009-09-15 12:49:00,864,ps mike. when we goin fishin ?
383509,MCTFisher9120,2009-09-15 19:35:00,3761," Righty. As for fishing, when does the boat leave the dock? lol, man it's all shore fishing around here. Found some appealing spots but still have yet to fish them.  Well see u soon, man i can't wait to ice fish this year(aka first time)"
383534,fish-miester,2009-09-15 21:05:00,864,"lol man , i got the boat on the water 24/7 most of the time.. and il be moving up there around nov 7th.."
383556,MCTFisher9120,2009-09-15 22:09:00,3761," Ah, nice nice. Might be a little cold for fishing though out of a boat. Anything really open around that time? How/where r u putting it, im assuming it's not coming up here."
383660,Dabluz,2009-09-16 01:33:00,701," If it's only 30 dollars difference then go for the CiticaE for sure.  If it was a difference of 60 to 100 dollars maybe you could say that there is a difference.  I don't own a CiticaE or even an old Citica.  However I do own some older reels that I bought ""used"" on Ebay:  Daiwa ProcasterZ H103LA, Daiwa ProcasterX H103A, Diawa MA15-2B, Shimano Bantam TX 101 Mag,  and they all work very very well.  I also own a new Shimano Cardiff 101A and new Shimano Calyx 100A.  But I can tell right away that the CiticaE is way smoother, faster, easier to adjust, easier to take apart for cleaning and lighter than anything I have right now except for the 2 reels with graphite bodies that I have which weigh about the same as the CiticaE.  A CiticaE at the local fishing boutique sells for 190.00.  This is way over my budget so I have to stick with the reels that I bought for under 30 dollars on Ebay.  BTW, you won't find anymore used Daiwa H103's on Ebay for under 75 dollars.  Before buying a reel, think very carefully about whether it's going to be one with the handles on the left or on the right.  Like almost everyone else, I cast with my right arm and crank with my left hand when spinning and even when fly fishing.  But for baitcasting, I prefer the handles on the righthand side of the reel.  Sure, I have both types and use both types but for real fast cranking, my right hand is faster than my left hand.  Since I am old enough to have used level wind reels when spinning reels were unavailable, all the level wind reels had the handles on the right and maybe this has influenced me a bit.  When casting, I still turn my wrist so that the spool is vertical and the handles are on top in order for the spool to spin only on it's main bearing.  And ""YES"", doing this with a reel with handles on the right does give you more distance and fewer backlashes.  I fish much more often with the Procaster X H103 than any of my other reels even though the Procaster Z (lefty) has more bearings.  I never use the graphite body reels anymore even though they are a bit lighter."
379001,fish-miester,2009-09-02 03:12:00,864,"was looking at the ""new'ish"" Rapala R-type rod and was really impressed with the comfort as well as how light it is.!  though was wondering if any one has any input on it ? or heard anything about it?   very interested in it though would like to know some more about it  thanks again  a fellow angler"
379004,uglyfish,2009-09-02 03:20:00,981,"heard nuthin but good things about them. i know a guy on the rapala prostaff, and he is in the process of selling all his other rods and reels, (st croix, shimano, quantum) and using only the rapala rods."
379009,MCTFisher9120,2009-09-02 03:28:00,3761, Where can they be bought? I'm guessing through Rapala's web site.
379012,fish-miester,2009-09-02 03:36:00,864,you can get them at bps as well as gagnouns.. not sure about hirks tho..  i have looked and wondered about them for a few months now.. but didnt want to be the first to waste my moneys.. and didnt know about warrenties .. tho i just looked into in and it seems like they have lifetime warrenties..  cant complain about that !
379045,Bernie66,2009-09-02 11:53:00,123,"Both there R-type series and the cheaper TS2s are great rods.  No problems with mine so far.  The R-type is $83 and the TS2 is $50 at Le Baron.  For that price, the rods are nice and light, sensitive and the fit and finish is very good.  Other people I've talked to also has nothing but good things to said about them.  I think the warranty is one year, not sure."
379047,bassman87,2009-09-02 12:04:00,586,"I thought R-Types are one year warranty but the ones higher are lifetime warranty, forgot the name (X-Type?)."
379068,K_F,2009-09-02 14:04:00,107,I have 2 new style Rapala magnum rods - 40$ & 60$ - and they have performed very well.  I was looking at the TS2 - but bought the second magnum
379091,Governator,2009-09-02 14:59:00,879,"I think every rod purchase comes down to personal feel.  Everyone has a different comfort level with holding rods and I think you always have to keep that in mind.  I'm not a professional and I'm not spending $200+ on a rod as I simply wouldn't gain the benefit from the additional cost with my rather limited experience.  But I definitely know after holding and testing many of them there are a select few that stand out to each person and it all depends on how you personally feel holding it.  As long as it's not going to snap when you're reeling in your trophy go by what feels best, afterall you're the one holding it for hours on end.  I say, if you're in the market for a new rod and if the R-Type is super comfortable, in your price range and people genearlly have positive reviews about it - buy it!"
379104,ecmilley,2009-09-02 15:29:00,2163,"i have a r-type it is a great rod for the price light and sensitive i use them for bottom bouncing and top water frogging, while it's not a crucial or avid it is more than compentant rod worth the $$$"
379110,Peps,2009-09-02 15:46:00,191,"I have an R-Type and I like it, performs great!!!"
379131,uglyfish,2009-09-02 16:54:00,981,"most stores around will carry the rods. im in hamilton, and i know fishing world, bills bait and grimsby tackle all carry the r type and TS2 rods. rapala also has a new line coming out too that they seem very high on. still waiting to get a peek at them."
379147,legacey,2009-09-02 17:14:00,127,"I have a couple and love them.  Very sensative, light and would buy more and recommend for sure!  Cheers,  Paul"
379307,Fang,2009-09-03 01:29:00,1330,"My 11 year old son has turned into quite the bass fisherman this year - smallies and now he wants to hit the slop for LB. I bought him 2 TS2's to start his own collection and so far they have worked out fantastic. I grab them in the boat and they feel great and so far have taken a lot of abuse.  There's a light muskie version 6'9"" at lebarons I think. I bought this one for a heavy bass rod for him and it makes a great pitchin and swimbait rod. I'll be using it this weekend  I've been to both bps and lebarons in the last week and the pickins for Rap rods is very slim for end of year guys"
380770,fish-miester,2009-09-08 13:10:00,864,I was looking at the 7'2 mh model for flippin jigs think that would work ?
380839,uglyfish,2009-09-08 17:53:00,981,"should be fine as long as ur not fishing really thick cover. i know the 7ft 2in med/hvy rod is one of their more popular and versitile rods. i seen them used to catch bass, walleye, pike, muskie, channel cats and even sturgeon believe it or not."
380842,Fang,2009-09-08 18:06:00,1330,Yeah open water light cover only. The light muskie rod I got works for docks and pads no problem
380855,fish-miester,2009-09-08 18:29:00,864,but docks and pads should be alright? i think im going to go pick it up tonight and pair it with a curado e
380861,uglyfish,2009-09-08 18:37:00,981,should work just fine for ya bro!
380924,ecmilley,2009-09-08 21:03:00,2163,i have that excat set up with 40 lb power pro i was pulling out buckets on the weekend in some slop my trolling motor was having problems getting through
381022,fish-miester,2009-09-09 01:16:00,864,"beauty, thats what i like to hear ! haha i will be picking it up either thurs or fri now"
381023,fish-miester,2009-09-09 01:16:00,864,"ps how big is the rod sock ? can you cover the whole rod? or rod and reel , or multiple rods.. no reels?"
381120,dada2727,2009-09-09 03:08:00,108,"If your using it primarly for the slop and heavy cover like timber, I would beef it up a little to a heavy power.  I have the new mojo bass flippin stick and this thing can pull out the hogs from the thickest cover!  It's a 7'11"" heavy power with a moderate/fast action.  The reason behind the moderate fast is because it's almost 8 feet long, and you don't need all that backbone, better use in a little more shock absorbtion.  Really got to test it out when I set the hook into a nice 5.5 lber the other weekend, turned his head right away from the dock and when he jump and thrashed on the surface, the rod stayed perfectly loaded.  I would definetly talk a look at the mojo bass rods from st. croix, they have a nice pitchin' stick too you might be interested in, and they all go for around $100!  Best bang for your buck out there right now IMO.  Just my 2 cents"
381215,fish-miester,2009-09-09 13:51:00,864,"very tru , and honestly that was a huge toss up in my mind , im liking the R-type for its weight and its almost perfect , tho im not sure if its got ALL the backbone i need, where as the mojo is nice , but im really looking for somthin really light .. as realisticly i have heavy cover rods, aka 7'6 H crucial , and 7' xh carrot stik"
381467,dada2727,2009-09-09 22:33:00,108,"check out the mojo bass pitchin' stick then, you can use it for light to medium flippin applications too.  I'm just a big st. croix guy thats all, wish they would sponsor me so I wouldn't have to spend so much!  Not sure Rapala has really proven themselves in the rod market yet.  I had one of their cheaper ones, not sure which model but around $40 I think, and it snapped pretty easily on me."
383194,MCTFisher9120,2009-09-15 01:28:00,3761,"The R-Type at the Canadian Tire in Lindsay were 110 I think, I bought a 6'7"" MH Rapala TS2 Trigger Rod today(My first baitcaster  )  All I can say is wow, for $65.99 before tax this rod is state of the art, those R-Type rods are amazing also but for 75bucks with tax in this is amazing, a great first rod for myself and the hunt for a reel now begins!
