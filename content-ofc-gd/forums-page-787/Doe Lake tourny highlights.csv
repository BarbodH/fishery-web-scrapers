382979,Skud,2009-09-14 16:00:00,739,"Great weather was the highlight. The fishing was tough as always on the lake. Only 27 out of 45 boats even brought in fish to weigh and there was no hogs brought in. A 6lb walleye was the big fish of the day and 12 lbs overall was the winners weight.  We ourselves had boat problems and were at Katrina Marina getting fixed up when the 7:30am Shotgun start happened. We eventually got back in action and were washing our lures by 10am. Only two small pike graced us for the weigh in. The top 10 placements got cash and everybody received prizes. Ran into Reefhawg out there too.  Fishing Doe was a far cry from Attawapiskat. I fished Fri morning, Saturday and Sun morning and only had 3 smallies and 8 hammerhandles  to show for my efforts. I'm going to have to start saving for my next fly-in. Here are a few pics I took on the weekend including my Bro-in-law's Skeeter we burned around the lake on.   "

383069,misfish,2009-09-14 20:23:00,29133,Did it produce?    Yeah pop and my bro said the fishing was not the best. They caught a few small ones aswell.  They were in the 2008 red lund.
383181,Skud,2009-09-15 01:16:00,739,The bay in the picture coughed up a few small pike on Sunday morn. I usually catch smallies there.  We fished the main lake on Tourny day hoping to catch some big pike on the drop offs like you suggested but they didn't cooperate.  Solopaddler;  I will be ready to fish again as soon as my arms stop hurting.

383444,Basskicker,2009-09-15 15:36:00,421,3 days on Doe after the Attawaspiskat......too funny. Better than work any day. I spent 4 days of Rice at the trailer and caught 11 walleye....(I was shocked)....1 pushing 6-7 pounds. Thanks again Skud for the great times at the Attawaspiskat  Jason
383544,Skud,2009-09-15 21:31:00,739,It's crazy how after fishing for a week and catching loads of fish we are still more than happy to fish hard all day for just a few.  Did you do any Musky chasing on Rice yet?
383661,Basskicker,2009-09-16 01:34:00,421,No...not yet...too much fun catching my 1st walleye and then 10 more.....it was nice to figure the walleye thing out for the first time and the best part about it all........was that it about a 30 second boat ride from the trailer.
