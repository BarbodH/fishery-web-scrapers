I've seen from a few ""TRUE"" beer drinkers, they prefer their beer at an ambient temperature... also known as Weasel Piss flavor/temp!"
383723,Jonny,2009-09-16 03:53:00,1380," Excellent beer! I had a couple earlier this summer. But North Bay LCBO doesn't stock it, and the big Sudbury store stopped stocking it.    They're welcome to it!  If God had meant for man to drink beer warm, we wouldn't have ice coolers and refrigerators."
383739,Mattitude,2009-09-16 06:33:00,155," I tried Hoegaarden on tap few years ago and very impressed with it.  Almost has a floral taste but whatever, it was good."
383935,CLofchik,2009-09-16 20:37:00,854," That's my fault, anytime I find a beer I like it soon disappears from the shelves from our overpriced, unionized gov't monopoly stores.  Aaargh. Now that the provincial gov't has pretty much devastated the corner store with their war on tobacco, they could atleast open up the option for some depanneurs, like other more civilized provinces."
