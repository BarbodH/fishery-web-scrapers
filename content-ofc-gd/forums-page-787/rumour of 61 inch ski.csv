383010,tonka-toy,2009-09-14 18:13:00,139,Heard a rumour a 61 inch long muskie was reported  and later pulled from a musky site this weekend.Does anyone have any details?

383039,muskeybugged,2009-09-14 19:45:00,282,The last one I caught seems to be getting closer to that mark every time I tell the story!
383042,richyb,2009-09-14 19:48:00,774,the only SKI I have ever caught that was that long had bindings and a waxy finish on the bottom.
383044,tonka-toy,2009-09-14 19:54:00,139,my best two added together this year may not make that mark.
383049,fishingisliving,2009-09-14 19:59:00,170,"aparently a 61 inch pike was also caught...    http://www.gofishing.co.uk/Angling-Times/S...ld-record-pike/  so far in the last couple weeks:  new record rainbow new record brown new record pike (from last winter?)  giant alligator gars, make people fear for their lives in hong kong.. http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/classified-odd/...hong-kong-ponds  the fishing news keeps going on!

383687,kickingfrog,2009-09-16 02:48:00,8333, Have you seen how musky posts (among others) go down hill here sometimes? The question of length (never trust a guy about that in the first place) and proper handling are the top 2 reasons a musky post goes sour.
383760,Daplumma,2009-09-16 11:19:00,1961,I think the steehead topics go downhill faster.I heard that steelhead dont actually eat marshmallows.
383763,Greencoachdog,2009-09-16 11:37:00,8163,  You're wrong Bubba Joe... steelhead and salmon LOVE the marshmallows!!!
383870,BillM,2009-09-16 16:50:00,17367," They love marshmellows, and earplugs!!!!"
