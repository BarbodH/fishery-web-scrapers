866295,Lucky Linda,2014-08-04 16:06:00,93,"Ha! Bill you don't know me very well. Nothing stops me from the fishing part lol. Manuals beside my bed ?  I will never figure it all out, but just the spot lock was worth the $.  Linda"
866301,BillM,2014-08-04 17:42:00,17367,"I put a kipawa prop on mine, very happy with it...ordered the foot pedal as well, love the complete control you get  only very minor complaint I've noticed, is sometimes in spot lock it will wrap the cord around the shaft  It shouldn't do this..  When mine is about to wrap it does a complete 360 and unwraps itself.  Linda, the spot lock is definitely the best feature...  I use it all the fime in the fall for open water smallies when they're smashing bait fish 30ft down over 50ft of water.   Love it!"
866302,Lucky Linda,2014-08-04 17:46:00,93,I better get out there and see if mine does that lol
866341,lakerguy,2014-08-04 20:55:00,224,What's a kipawa prop?
866342,John Bacon,2014-08-04 21:00:00,3277,What's a kipawa prop?  http://www.kipawapropellers.com/  I had to look it up myself.
866344,davey buoy,2014-08-04 21:13:00,5505,"Looks like you would get a great hole shot!  .Seriously,looks like better speed and quicker reaction speed. Must use more battery power I would think?.They say better battery use.Something to look at over the winter I think."
866350,bare foot wader,2014-08-04 22:15:00,1354,"not sure about the battery life, never really compared that, I ordered the kipawa prop fairly quick after getting my trolling motor...but it is noticeably more responsive and better control in wind and big chop compared to the standard mk prop...I don't fish very thick weed beds like some ON lakes, but it has no issues with the weeds I do encounter"
866372,RickOnt,2014-08-05 00:11:00,669,BFW   AS Bill said it should unwrap itself Never had an issue with mine!  Spot Lock is the best I do a lot of jigging for Lakers/Whities here on Simcoe in 100 plus feet of water It is a 'HUGE' pleasure not having to deal with 150' of anchor rope and chain.  Linda you might never use the foot pedal!!  I have had my Terrova for 3 years and other than hooking it up to see if it worked I have never used it!!  Terrova vs PD no comparison for store and deploy Terrova much simpler   Enjoy your Terrova  Cheers Rick
866413,lakerguy,2014-08-05 11:59:00,224,Thanks J
866456,bare foot wader,2014-08-05 17:58:00,1354,"thanks for the feedback on the wrapping issue....doesn't happen often but it does happen, i'll try to take a video of it next time, follow up with minn kota"
867212,Lucky Linda,2014-08-12 12:04:00,93,"Just want to thank everyone again. I am soooo happy with the Terrova! And in my lake very happy with the 60"" shaft. If the waves are any size...i need the length. Can't believe the power and battery life! The remote is for me! I can stay seated...anywhere on the boat. I have been known to nearly toss myself overboard with the foot controls on the one I used before. It's just lack of experience and being underpowered I am sure but this Terrova is amazing. Love it!!"
867262,MrSimon,2014-08-12 17:34:00,217,"Another happy Terrova/HB 898 guy here.  If you don't already have a HB unit that talks to the Terrova .... go get one!!!  Its amazing how much control you have without leaving your seat.  The ability to drive over a spot, freeze the screen and move the cursor to exactly where you want it .... set a waypoint, then tell the trolling motor to take you to it and hold you on the spot.   Its almost like cheating."
864735,Lucky Linda,2014-07-25 23:16:00,93,"I have read most of the past posts on this topic but quite a few are from 2013.  I was sold on the ipilot 80, then someone told me the 70 would work.  Now I am reading about the stow and deploy part and think that it would be easier for me if the trolling motor was easy to put in and out. But maybe I can get use to it?  Shaft I have read not to get the short one...do I need 60""?  I value your input! Please help!"
864736,Pigeontroller,2014-07-25 23:24:00,2793,"The Terrova is lights years nicer than the Power Drive. Longer shaft is better, you can always raise it in shallow water, but when you're in a chop and its popping out of the water, you can't make it longer!"
864737,Terry,2014-07-25 23:26:00,14456,"get the 80, you can never have too much power  again if you have the room for the longer shaft get it, on windy days you will be glad you have a long shaft"
864742,Lucky Linda,2014-07-25 23:47:00,93,Thanks for your help guys! I guess I was on the right track from the start.

864747,Terry,2014-07-25 23:57:00,14456,nice fish
864748,Lape0019,2014-07-26 00:00:00,647,"I have the terrova with a 60"" shaft and I pilot. My dad has a powerdrive original. There is no comparing the two. Mine is easy to stow and deploy. His is a bugger to stow and deploy and the pedal on the powerdrive sucks compared to the terrova.  The 60"" shaft depends on what you have it mounted on. Mine is on a bass tracker 190tx and is too long for most situations I fish in. If I had a deep v, it would be perfect.  Oh an unless you are fine with just the ipilot (some people are) you will not get a pedal with the powerdrive if you install and ipilot. This may have changed though.  If you are really looking for the ultimate stow and deploy, check out the new Minnkota Ulterra. It looks like a terrova on steroids. It automatically stows and deploys with a push of a button on te ipilot remote. It can also be adjusted up or down using the remote or pedal. Not worth it for me to upgrade but if it would have been on the market when I bought the terrova, I would have seriously thought about it."
864750,Lucky Linda,2014-07-26 00:06:00,93,Oh boy lol More reading lol
864773,Lucky Linda,2014-07-26 02:03:00,93,Thanks Terry!
864776,BillM,2014-07-26 02:28:00,17367,"Stick with Terrova 80lb, 60in shaft.  That's what I run, and I'd never go back to a PD unit."
864778,Lucky Linda,2014-07-26 02:36:00,93,Thanks Bill! Just watching some video on youtube. This looks like what I want.
864818,mattp33,2014-07-26 13:39:00,290,Go as long and powerful as you can afford.  Terrova is WAY better as stated above
864821,Rodwrap,2014-07-26 14:05:00,130,I bought a 24V-80lb terrova I-pilot link last summer for my Grumman I/O..I'm in love all over again!
864832,BillM,2014-07-26 15:39:00,17367,I bought a 24V-80lb terrova I-pilot link last summer for my Grumman I/O..I'm in love all over again!  I spend more time playing with the I-Pilot Link + HB 898 then I do fishing    So much fun.
864836,Lucky Linda,2014-07-26 16:42:00,93,Done! Bought!! Whoo Hoo!
864869,manjo39,2014-07-26 19:15:00,354,I have a 60in shaft on my deep v and feel its too long.  Gets in the way more times than its length is worth.  I rarely have it deployed full length.  Wish I got a shorter length.  Check the Minnkota website for length guidelines.
865021,Lucky Linda,2014-07-27 19:26:00,93,Yikes! I thought it was adjustable. Will look into that. Thanks for the info!
865033,Terry,2014-07-27 20:26:00,14456,it is adjustable to  how far down it goes in shallow water  a foot and a half sticking up has never got in the way on me...I might be missing the point but I don't get it
865038,fishindevil,2014-07-27 21:36:00,6254,Not even a decision !!!! The I pilot all the way man !!!! It will hold you on structure and troll a weed edge !!! Man the list goes on & on !!!! The comparison is not even valid !!!! Cheers oh ya .... I pilot all the way !!!! Trust me
865040,BillM,2014-07-27 21:44:00,17367,Yikes! I thought it was adjustable. Will look into that. Thanks for the info!  It is...  I've never complained about it being too long in 2-3ft waves    You can always shorten it if needed.
865049,Lucky Linda,2014-07-27 22:26:00,93,Thanks Guys!! Ipilot 80 long shaft. Done. Now I need to learn how to use it ?

866268,Lucky Linda,2014-08-04 12:46:00,93,"I just want to thank everyone for all the help!  We have the new boat, did a 'boating' day as I wanted to get to the current where Lake Huron and the St. Clair River meet (it wasn't fun to take the 25HP in that current and try to fish) and just drive the boat.  I did have a chance to try the Terrova a bit....I am so impressed! It's amazing!! I tried the ""anchor lock"" yesterday and it was like a dream come true. So much power, very happy with the 60"" shaft in the waves and its all adjustable so good word on that advice. I like the button where I can press for North..for when I feel a little turned around. I haven't even pulled the foot pedal part out yet...just had a blast with the remote. It had me going over 3 miles an hour in current!  I felt like I had a friend on the bow of the boat...amazing!  Thanks again!  linda"
866289,porkpie,2014-08-04 15:39:00,2521,"I don't have ipilot, just co-pilot on my MK.  I can only imagine how nice the ipilot would be! Copilot itself is fantastic.  The IP must be a mind blower LOL!"
866291,BillM,2014-08-04 15:46:00,17367,"I-Pilot Link is pretty fun, you can easily stop fishing and mess around with it for quite some time    Ask me how I know this!"
