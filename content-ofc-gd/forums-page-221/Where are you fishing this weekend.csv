866835,BillM,2014-08-08 16:44:00,17367,Pigeon visiting a friend that just bought a house on the lake.  Perhaps  a muskie or two.  From what I've seen on Google Maps it's a weed infested lake that's going to have a billion people on it..  Can't wait!  /sarcasm.
866839,AKRISONER,2014-08-08 18:40:00,5558,"lol @ weed infested...aka the lake is weeds thats it.   personally heading to pointe au baril tomorrow, then boating down to parry sound harbour for the evening laker bite...sleeping in the boat overnight and rigging sunday morning before first light."
866868,Sinker,2014-08-08 22:20:00,8692,"You believe everything you read on the internet?  Sure, it might be busy, but weed infested? Nope, not at all.  If you don't connect with a musky your doing something wrong on pigeon. So much structure, and lots of fish.  Where abouts on the lake will you be? Maybe I can help ya out a little.  S."
865900,Rod Caster,2014-08-01 01:59:00,5784,"Elliot Lake Sat and Sunday  for Brookies, pike and bass.  Then to BOQ for Walleye for the rest of the week.  I hope the weather stabilizes.
