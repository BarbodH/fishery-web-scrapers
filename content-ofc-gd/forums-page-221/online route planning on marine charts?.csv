Kinda like google map but on the water.  I guess i could plug in some waypoints on my chartplotter to see the total distance but anything I can plan while at home/office? That's right at the office lol"
866823,thegrumpyfisherman,2014-08-08 15:04:00,59,Navionics makes an App that claims to allow most of what you want.  The app itself is free but I would assume the maps to make it work aren't.  Not sure if the SD chip used in the fishfinder works with the app or if you have to pay additionally.  I haven't tried it myself I'm sure someone has though.
