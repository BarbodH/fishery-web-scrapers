Companies committing heinous crimes such as this would immediately be taken away from those in charge and placed under government control. If they are found guilty, they would not be allowed to have their jobs back, and all normal compensation (retirement benefits, 'golden handshakes', etc.) would be forfeited. The company would continue to run, workers would still have jobs, and sooner or later a buyer would be found, or new management would move up the ladder."

The Federal reduction in the requirments for Environmental Assessments (EA's) for new 'projects' will precipitate more events like this. The whole point of a properly conducted EA is to identify and mitigate potential impacts like this. I can't understand why any company would prefer cheaping out on up-front EA's and risk company-bankrupting events like this."
