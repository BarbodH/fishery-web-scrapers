866914,fishhard,2014-08-09 17:11:00,6,My daughter's friend wants to come out in the boat while we go fishing for salmon. She wants no part in fishing at all just wants to come out to hang out. I would think she needs a license if on boat even if not fishing? thanks
866915,Pikeslayer,2014-08-09 17:15:00,1443,"Negative. But she cannot fish in any way shape or form. If u have a derby ticket however, you will be disqualified."
866916,Steve,2014-08-09 17:17:00,2075,no license required if not fishing....  but if your in the GOSD derby - the derby responsible for keeping more new anglers off the water during the derby days - you will not be eligible to weigh in a fish unless everyone on board has a derby ticket.
866917,Terry,2014-08-09 17:41:00,14456,"I had to argue with them, because my wife was in the boat without a license  and I had 6 rods out fishing bass she was not fishing he said the equipment was there to use , so she could be charged  I said she was going to charge him with attempted rape after all he has the equipment.........he did not see the humor  but he insisted I could only have one rod out per license ....  no charges..of course  some of them don't know their own laws"
866918,fishhard,2014-08-09 17:53:00,6,wow thanks for fast replies! She is scared to touch rod after seeing some of the salmon pics!
866921,HTHM,2014-08-09 19:04:00,4082,"If she is under 18 it does not matter, doesn't need one."
866926,Sinker,2014-08-09 20:14:00,8692,"No, she doesnt need anything but a PFD to go for a boat ride.  S."
866942,Lape0019,2014-08-10 03:02:00,647,"As long as she does not touch a lure, fishing rod or anything related to fishing within eyesore of a CO, she cannot be charged and you will be fine."
866945,Old Ironmaker,2014-08-10 05:27:00,8243,"My wife seldom fishes but likes coming along if water conditions suit her. So as to not have any arguments I just go out and get her a Conservation license. Then I can run 4 rods on Erie!!! Mine, all mine."
