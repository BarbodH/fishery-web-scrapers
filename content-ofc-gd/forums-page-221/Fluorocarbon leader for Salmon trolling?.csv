867227,AKRISONER,2014-08-12 13:34:00,5558," It applies to everything unless there's an exception in the regulations.  False, "
867229,Sinker,2014-08-12 13:54:00,8692,Did you check thhe exceptions for icefishing though?  S.
867235,AKRISONER,2014-08-12 14:33:00,5558,"yes, only in parry sound harbour is 1 line allowed. This is once again to protect the laketrout population. I typically ice fish for pike and pickerel in the pointe au baril area. All good!"
867236,BillM,2014-08-12 14:34:00,17367,"  False,     It's not false.   Is there an exception that states you are not allowed to use 2 lines through the ice in Gbay?  No.   Only in Parry Sound like you mentioned."
866270,Lukasaurus,2014-08-04 13:49:00,19,"Hey Guys & Gals, I need some advice on using Fluorocarbon as a leader while trolling for salmon in Georgian Bay. Years ago when I fished the clear waters of Georgian Bay for salmon, I caught my fair share of salmon using downriggers with spoons and body baits with14 lb. mono. I took a few years off from fishing (I took up archery), but the last couple years after being back at it, and using the same tackle, line size and trolling tactics have produced very few fish. I know the numbers and size of salmon are way down compared to years ago, but I thought I would have more success than I am having. Well after many hours of poor success I FINALLY realize I have to change my tactics. I am thinking the first thing I should change is use a fluorocarbon leader since that water is really really clear. I was thinking of 14 lb. mono main line and a 14 lb. fluoro leader. How does that sound? Any suggestions on a knot to tie the 2 lines together with?"
866288,BillM,2014-08-04 15:33:00,17367,No need to run flouro leaders for salmon..  Your 14lb mono will be just fine.
866348,John Bacon,2014-08-04 21:59:00,3277,You may also want to try Spin Doctors with flies or herring strips.  These are productive on Lake Ontario.  Copper line or lead core are options too.  Salmon fishing is not as simple as it was in the 80s and 90s.
866349,BillM,2014-08-04 22:00:00,17367,SD and flies are always on the dipsys when out for kings...
866370,Lukasaurus,2014-08-05 00:01:00,19,"I have been hearing about lead core line and dipsy divers. What makes lead core better than downriggers.  Would the lure have more action using lead core?  If so, would a longer lead from the cannon ball not work the same? That's why I was thinking of using a fluorocarbon leader with a longer lead, maybe the cannon ball was spooking the fish."
866398,John Bacon,2014-08-05 04:18:00,3277,"You spread your lines out because divers take your line down and out to the side while the down riggers just your line straight down.  In the great lakes where you can run two rods per person; the dipsys combined with copper or lead core will allow to run more lines.  I only have two down riggers in my boat; but I can run two Dipsys on either side of my boat in addition to running the two down riggers.  I could run two coppers or lead cores off a planer board mast and still have room to run a rod with copper, leader, or a diver straight off my stern.  This gives me nine options on a 16' boat with two down riggers."
866407,12footspringbok,2014-08-05 10:52:00,459,"Running straight mono seems to work just fine. I still run straight 15lb mono and seem to do ok out on G-Bay.  Although,  some guys seem to be doing good with braid and then running fluoro leaders as well... Not sure about the cannon balls spooking fish either I've been marking fish like crazy coming right in checking out my balls the past few weeks. First thing in the morning I like to run close to the balls. Later in the day, when the bite dies I go with a super long lead.  With G-Bay from what I can tell if you're not getting any fish its because they simply aren't there...."
866415,SirCranksalot,2014-08-05 12:37:00,3291,Some folks run straight braid when fishing lures for salmon. It's an aggressive strike and they don't seem to notice or care. The reason for using a leader in that case is not to make the line invisible but to create a weak point---or 'fuse'-- so as not to lose a lot of braid on a line break.
866489,Lukasaurus,2014-08-05 20:53:00,19,"OK, thanks guys. I guess changing line is not the answer. I will have to make some other changes to increase my odds."
866499,misfish,2014-08-05 21:17:00,29133,Theres a guy I know that uses high vis green raven line and does well for lakers. Maybe were all getting to complicated here.  Im just saying from first hand visual experience.
866528,FloatnFly,2014-08-05 23:50:00,1640,"OK, thanks guys. I guess changing line is not the answer. I will have to make some other changes to increase my odds.   remember in ontario, you're allowed 4 hooks/lures (trebles don't count as 3 hooks) per line.......when im out we run a slider/cheater line down to the clips with a snap swivel, use about a 5ft leader with a spoon on the end.  you want your spread to look like a school of bait fish to draw the bigger fish in"

866537,Old Ironmaker,2014-08-06 00:31:00,8243,"Being on crystal clear Erie a Flourocarbon leader is a must I strongly believe. Why would I risk the line being seen no matter what clear water you are fishing  if technology now gives me the option of an invisible line? Just another advantage to take, can't have enough advantages. Maybe I'm wrong but confidence is a plus."

Nothing to protect the line if a biggun takes it deep, especially later in the season when teeth are bigger.  A spoon protects the line, usually.  So Charlie Wray recommended 30-40 lb fluoro from flasher or dypsy back.  Talked to him about the problem at a fishing show.  Not so much for invisibility.  For toughness.  Leader material is best.  Tougher yet.  Helped a lot."

I am just getting into downriggin for laketrout personally as the salmon fishing is terrible these days. Ive spent 30+ hours and only ever caught one salmon, hardly worth it.  A lot of people are talking about using braid as your mainline, I personally would advise against it as the spiny water flee problem is so ridiculous in the bay that I couldnt imagine what it would do to braid. Its a pain enough using Fluoro."
