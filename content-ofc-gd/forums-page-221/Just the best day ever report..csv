866897,Old Ironmaker,2014-08-09 13:01:00,8243,"Years ago when all the kids were coming along at the same time VHS video recorders came out everyone seemed to have one, a new kid came with a VCR recorder it seemed. Every time we visited friends and relatives we had to try and get through endless loops of home video accompanied by all the inane play by play of the kids doing what kids do. ""Watch Hunter jump up in the air, wait, I'll rewind it! "" Someone kill me please!!!!!  Yours I actually enjoy, good job."
866902,limeyangler,2014-08-09 13:51:00,5204,"Dad of the year goes to.......  Super video!  Thanks!  Man you two are certainly building an awesome relationship Yeah, in the past year or so we have been really getting into things together, he's got a very unique outlook on the world. He is also unbelievably empathetic of other people's feelings and a considerate, well behaved mini dude who loves the outdoors,bugs,mud etc.....we are very lucky to live where we do right now.  Isn't that what life is about?  Wonderful video!  Thanks for sharing!  Exactly! Definitely what I think life is all about, and Jack is developing a real attachment and understanding of the natural world.   That is totally awesome congrats and thanks for taking the time for making and posting the video  Thanks Mike, it does take a while to wittle down over an hours worth of video clips and organise them into manageable sizes, but well worth it as they are priceless memories.
