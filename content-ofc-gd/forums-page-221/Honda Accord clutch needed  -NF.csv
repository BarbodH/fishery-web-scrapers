866698,captpierre,2014-08-07 03:14:00,2521,"2004 Honda Accord.  4 cyl.  Standard.  185,000 km.  Bought a standard so all 4 kids learn the stick.  She's starting to slip for a second or 2 after shifting.  Took into CT for oil change.  They said it needs to be replaced.  I want a good job done for best price.  Thinking of getting a few quotes.  Who should I ask?  Dealer?  Mister Transmission?  CT?  Private garage?  Thanks "

866712,ecmilley,2014-08-07 10:33:00,2163,Mr t. Or any reputable trans shop usually there the fastest do enough of them to know all the little parts that nay be required

866772,DRIFTER_016,2014-08-07 23:47:00,10439,"I don't like other people working on my rig so I would do it myself. I find it really hard to pay someone else a bunch of $$$$ for something I can do. If I were to take it to a shop for a clutch or tranny issue it would be a tranny shop. Mr T, Aamco etc."
866791,captpierre,2014-08-08 01:50:00,2521,I'm getting quotes of $1650-$2000 + HST for Honda parts and 8-10 hrs of labour.  $100 less for aftermarket  Might be time to get a new car

866795,Freshtrax,2014-08-08 03:08:00,2215,"can you turn a wrench?   replacing a clutch seems hard but really its only about 20 bolts.   i have done 4-5 fwd cars in the driveway.  and about 20 rwd ones.  remove wheels, remove cv shafts( brakes axle nut and lower bj,)   unbolt tranny from engine.   put new clutch in. now do it all in reverse.  i just priced a clutch for my sisters carrola 238 $ tax included."
