866533,The Urban Fisherman,2014-08-06 00:15:00,2050,"I started all my boys out on regular spinning reels. They each got their own rod/reel at 3 years old. I found with a full length rod they could just drop the float and hook in beside the dock without the need to cast. Eventually they figure out the casting. Bucket is a must and we always brought bug nets for minnows and frogs and such. They are now 4,5 and 7 and they do it all form baiting, casting, nice hooksets, retrieving, unhooking, and releasing. It's such a joy to watch. Also, if I were to get up at 5am to go fishing and not wake the 5 and 7 year old, I'd be disowned.  bahaha I hear you on the disowned deal... better to teach them as young as possible or you'll never get to fish yourself.  Everyone has given great advice here - Good luck and be sure to post some pics!  ps. In case it hasn't been mentioned... my kids started off with ice fishing rods.. spinning reels.  When it was time to move up to a full sized rod they already knew how to handle a spinning reel and didn't have to make the transition from a push button reel.  pss. saw the pics... awesome work Uncle!"
866559,Sinker,2014-08-06 04:35:00,8692,"I started my kids with the ""kids"" rods, and noticed the trouble they had with them right away. Just try using one yourself....its not easy to fish with shoddy equipment. I ended up getting them decent set ups at an early age, because it made it a lot easier for them. They're smart, they'll figure it out quick.  There arent many things more exciting to a child than catching a fish. Once the seed is planted, it grows like wildfire.  S."
866586,AKRISONER,2014-08-06 13:49:00,5558,"do you guys find that the little guys have a bit of a hard time operating the bail on a spinning set up? he definitely gets the idea of jigging, but his timing isnt the best yet...more practice will help. I still would like to teach him to actually operate the bail, let out line etc etc."
866588,Musky or Specks,2014-08-06 14:14:00,2710,My son started with this  http://www.basspro.com/Daiwa-Underspin-XD-Trigger-Reels/product/96662/  You can see it in the first pic. Its a great training reel for a spinning reel.The next step was a Quantum Hypercast  http://www.tackletour.com/reviewquanthpx20.html  And after that he was able to use any spinning reel. The baitcaster was a bit harder to teach.
866633,AKRISONER,2014-08-06 19:13:00,5558,"well considering the fact that I cant even use a baitcaster, i wouldnt worry about it ahhaa.  ive used one of those trigger spinning reels just totally forgot they existed....that would be perfect!  thanks for the tips"
866634,misfish,2014-08-06 19:17:00,29133,  I had one for my UL years back. Nice little reel. Made by Zebco.

865637,AKRISONER,2014-07-30 20:10:00,5558,"Hey guys,  I have a nephew who is 5 years old, he loves to come out on the dock (lifejacket always on of course) with me while I am fishing. he brings his little Mickey Mouse special rod with a jig weight with the hook removed and will spend a fair amount of time with me out on the dock casting away.  Typically, his imagination is so vivid that it keeps him entertained, however I am wondering what techniques and tips you guys might have for keeping the young guy calm but interested.  There are tonnes of panfish around for him to definitely reel in on a bobber or the like.  The biggest challenge is that he is a pretty intense little guy so swinging hooks around isn't necessarily the safest thing for him to be engaging in...  (you should see him cast, he outcasts my 24 year old girlfriend)"
865644,Governator,2014-07-30 20:31:00,879,"The best way is to put down your own rod for a bit and show as much interest in helping him as he has watching you (either have him sit on your lap or stand infront of you, etc).  Work with him for a little bit to get the hang of safety on the dock and the rules we have to follow.  If you don't follow those simple rules someone will get hurt.  With my 5yr old, he's more interested & calm about anything when I want to teach him and show him something.  If I make him feel like he's a bother it's game over.  Patience"
865653,aplumma,2014-07-30 21:00:00,6896,A bobber with a small hook loaded with a nightcrawler will keep the hook out of him and give him a visual to watch as his bobber dances. A few calming lessons might also be needed if he is wild with the casting.   Art
865657,kickingfrog,2014-07-30 21:18:00,8333,Something else to consider is bucket of some sorts to put a few panfish in. Sometimes that is more entertainment then the fishing.

865661,tender52,2014-07-30 21:26:00,270,I gotta agree with all 3 reply's.  You wont go wrong.
865662,AKRISONER,2014-07-30 21:31:00,5558,hmmm the idea of the blue gills and sunfish in a bucket sounds very cool.
865672,limeyangler,2014-07-30 23:01:00,5204,hmmm the idea of the blue gills and sunfish in a bucket sounds very cool. Definitely the minnow bucket/leeches and crawlers keep my 5 year old amused for hours to my wife's utter disgust and dismay!
865676,Sinker,2014-07-30 23:22:00,8692,"Yep, dont forget the bucket!! Most important part of the kit when my young lad was that age. A bucket with minnows (or panfish), a box of worms/leeches, a small net for catching critters, and a few snacks and drinks....good for a few hours no problem.  The hardest part for my kids was when it was time to leave  S."
865684,Roy,2014-07-30 23:52:00,13728,"Pinch the barbs down on his hooks till he gets the hang of it. And yes give him the attention he will need.  BTW, if I had a 24 year old girlfriend, I wouldn't care if she could cast or not,."
865685,mattyk,2014-07-31 00:08:00,2110,Don't take your rod. Just help him fish.

My nephew is a little high strung yet to bait a hook that's for sure. He is a super well behaved kid and always listens etc. He just really gets pumped up when cool things happen, I.E. if he catches a fish hes going to lose his mind ahahhaa I am actually really looking forward to trying this.  @imperial angler: Its easy to have 24 year old girlfriends when you are 26 lol  I hope his tiny mickey mouse rod can handle a sunfish!"
865747,crappieperchhunter,2014-07-31 13:39:00,2582,"The bucket for sure  With 2 kids of my own and now grandkids the good old white bucket has seen everything....minnows,fish,crawfish,frogs,leeches, big scary water bugs,turtles even a mouse or two. And if there is some wild flowers around picking a few to throw in the bucket to take home to give to mom or grandma is always a nice idea too.  I always take Dads cookies too. The ones in 2 per package. Send the nephew into your tackle bag for some cookies to share. Open the 2 pack and have a cookie each while you sit on the river bank and enjoy the day. My whole family knows I always have Dad's cookies in my tackle bag.  Enjoy your day and share some pictures if you get any."

866429,AKRISONER,2014-08-05 14:20:00,5558,"Success!  A small piece of worm covering the hook worked the best, ditched the bobber and jigged away...caught 12 fish, mixture of sunfish, rock bass, perch and blue gills.  Now ive got him asking me to go fishing! He is still nervous about touching and holding them so i spent the time taking a lot of fish off. we collected them in a big tupperware container full of lake water and he was mesmerized!  His small rod wasnt the best due to the crappy mono with crazy memory on it. Was having a hard time keeping the line tight for hook sets. Now with a little practice on his jigging we will have to get him going for the fall pickerel run! "

It would be good to get my nephew something that he can actually learn to fish on now. He can cast and reel etc, he just doesnt have anything that is easy for him to handle for his size."
