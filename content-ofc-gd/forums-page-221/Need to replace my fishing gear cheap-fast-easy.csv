865232,colin519,2014-07-28 19:42:00,101,"Hello all,  So I am in the unfortunate position of needing to replace all my necessary tackle in the next few weeks (before I go to fish Temagami for a week). I am going to need to buy a new reel and at a minimum some terminal tackle and likely a few spoons and Rapalas. Some punk smashed my window (ya ya I shouldn't have taken all my gear with me to work  ) and stole my KVD bag with all of my reels, line, and my box of (mostly new) cranks. The police have caught the person, but it doesn't seem like I'm going to see any of my items back.  Is there a cheap place online to do this? Bass Pro and Cabelas all seem expensive for jigs but maybe it's just me.  Is there a local place (local to London or to Toronto) that is worth going for all this stuff? I'd love to one stop shop as I've already been to two or three places to get items right before this happened and I'm kinda dreading touring around to SAIL, BPS, Cabelas.  Any suggestions for must have items? Basically at this point, I'm falling back on minnows and jigs and may grab a few cranks and spoons if the budget is still there after the trip is paid for. "
865241,AKRISONER,2014-07-28 20:05:00,5558,live bait all day.  Al Flahertys has a solid selection of crank baits and the like without the absolutely gigantic size.  As far as cheap though and in a week. Too late to shop online...
865243,davew3,2014-07-28 20:08:00,430,Colin   go to the local Canadian Tire store.   You should be able to equip yourself.  Regards
865244,colin519,2014-07-28 20:13:00,101,"thanks for the replies so far. the local canadian tires down have much but it's worth checking out. to clarify, i leave in a few weeks. spending a week up there."
865251,Tom McCutcheon,2014-07-28 20:32:00,627,Stop in at Angling Outfitters just outside of Woodstock on highway 2. I know he always has a good supply of jigs and cranks for everything from panfish to muskie. He also carries a good assortment of rods and reels.

The everyday stuff wasn't a big deal but I had a lot of things in there that had been given to me by friends over the years, a lot of it was hand made, it all meant a lot to me and there it was gone. Several of my friends came to the rescue and were able to help me rebuild my box of memories to some degree, it will never be exactly the same but it's as close as it gets.  Where are you located? I checked your profile but it doesn't give much information. I might be able to help you out a bit, won't be brand new but I'm always willing to share what I can spare!"

865269,bare foot wader,2014-07-28 22:14:00,1354,"if you have a few weeks, buy the essentials you have confidence in and then keep on eye on the classifieds, lots of stuff is always coming up around here"
865273,FloatnFly,2014-07-28 22:52:00,1640,"look around on kijiji, you can usually score some good deals there temagami has a very wide variety of fish, especially if you get into some of the back lakes"
866648,colin519,2014-08-06 20:44:00,101,"hello again folks, i wanted to come back and follow up on my post. thanks to all that offered their advice and help.  i have broken the bank and replaced what i had to so i didn't feel undergeared. i only get away once every couple years so it means a lot to me to enjoy myself while i am up on the lake. this ended up being a bit more then I wanted, but i also got a couple of things i didn't have before. anyway as far as tackle:  terminal stuff: gamakatsu bait holders (great for senkos), mustad 1/0  for worm fishing, a couple packs of gama mono leaders w/ smaller bait hooks, 3 x 30lb small diameter wire leaders (gotta be able to target those pike), $25 dollars worth of various jigs. 5 bucks worth of splitshot of various size  softs: gulp alive black shad 3"" (1/2 pint for 9 bucks), 3"" black neon (black with red fleck) YUM twistertails small packs of YUM twistertails Yellow, black, silver fleck, brown. gulp 3"" chartreuse twister tails. 4"" gulp minnows, 4"" senkos  hards: i picked up a rapala top water, a couple of cranks that dive and got a pretty cheap deep running crank, 2 x williams wabler (gold and red/white of course), 1 x bluefox vibrax spinner , 1 x mepps black fury, 2 x strike king small buzz baits  i ended up getting terminal tackle at al flahretys. they were the cheapest, most convenient for me. they were lacking a bit in their soft plastic dept. most of the stock was older but i grabbed what i could from there and picked up the missing items at SAIL. while i was at SAIL, I replaced some of the other items that were lost, mainly a headlamp.  here what I have learned (aside from 'never leave anything of sentimental value in a car in downtown toronto')  -Al Flahrety's is my new go to for anything I can. they are inexpensive and pretty helpful. they don't have a selection like SAIL/BPS, but if you need what they have they are great. -SAIL is definitely my go to for camping stuff and any specific fishing stuff where i really need to have the exact item I want (black neon 3"" YUM fall into that category). -Canadian Tire is great for cheap combos but if you just needs the basics you can do better. you can however, get crazy deals on camping stuff here"
866654,Big Cliff,2014-08-06 21:04:00,6899,Glad to hear that you got yourseld all fixed up and ready to go!
866689,Nipfisher,2014-08-07 01:55:00,2449,When are you going? I would be more then willing to set you up with rods reels and any tackle you need. I am in North Bay only a minute from the by-pass. You will drive right past my place each way. If you want it I will get it ready for you to pick up and you could drop it off on your way back. No cost and no worries about used / lost tackle. PM me if you are interested in this option or if you need something specific that you haven't picked up yet.

Big Cliff you have a heart of Platinum, forget gold.  Colin, glad to rigged yourself for your trip. Looks like you have a good all round selection there. You used the word ""cheap"" a few times. I hope you mean inexpensive, cheap don't cut it, especially on terminal tackle. I learned about cheap the hard way, when my first hardwater 10 pound walleye got off when one of those ""cheap"" snap swivels straightened out like a paper clip!!!!!!!  The tackle you did name is good stuff. May I ask what rod, reel did you choose?"
866729,AKRISONER,2014-08-07 14:24:00,5558,"I am lucky to live 500 meters from Al Flahertys  As mentioned in the post, their plastics selection is very very very (can i say very again) limited.  Seems they are a bit more salmon/pike/musky etc etc oriented.  They only have about 6 type of spinnersbaits in the entire place. However their selection of inline spinners, spoons and crankbaits is very extensive. Basically, they have the necessities without going overboard, while only carrying higher quality products. Dont expect to purchase a bunch of rapala knockoffs, or crappy daredevil copycats. Its the real deal or its not carried.  For the salmon and trout trollers out there, they have a decent selection of dreamweaver flashers and flies.  When it comes to Hooks, weights, trebles, leaders and swivels, their selection is on point and well priced. The place still has a mom and pop shop feel so any time you ask a question, I am pretty sure you are speaking with the owner/manager and he knows exactly whats in stock."
866759,colin519,2014-08-07 19:38:00,101,"cheap for me is bang for my buck. i am big on jigs so buying other tackle for me is all a bit foreign, or at least its something i didn't do when i was young. i try to buy mustad or gamakatsu when i can just because they tend to catch pretty much whatever they are around. any recommendations on that stuff would be awesome. what is the consensus on danielson? they've got it at canadian tire and i picked up a few leaders of theirs. okay for hooks?  i'm not sure what the swivels were now.  my rod is a 6'6"" abu garcia specialist. the combo now sells for like 80 bucks at canadian tire (or 40), but it was more $ and a better styled reel when i got it 6 or 8 years ago. they have the nicest guides in an inexpensive combo IMO. however, the reel was stolen and i've purchased a plflueger president that i'm looking forward to trying. it seems well balanced with the rod but only a weeks fishing will decide if it's a good match. we typically target smallmouth but usually get the odd pike or walleye throughout the week.  as far as al flahretys goes, it seemed like they cater to the Lake O crowd and the heavy river crowd. Not my scene at this time."

866761,davey buoy,2014-08-07 20:18:00,5505,"I stepped back from Danielson a couple years back.Mustad swivels,snaps,hooks,pretty good quality with no complaints here .Also glad your on your way,Good luck!"
