He was 63. The sheriff's coroner's division said it suspects the death was a suicide due to asphyxia, but said the cause of death is still under investigation. Williams shot to fame through his stand-up comedy and first starring role in the Happy Days spin-off, Mork & Mindy. He went on to a successful film career, winning the best supporting actor Oscar for Good Will Hunting in 1997."
867127,bushart,2014-08-11 23:22:00,2628,Geez!!  I know it's been reported he's had issues---and some extraordinary funny people have a dark side (Jonathon Winters)  A great loss
867130,SlowPoke,2014-08-11 23:26:00,2984,Such a shame but not unusual for comedians/performers. A cruel irony that their despair drives them to bring so much happiness to others and yet it is not enough to bring happiness to themselves.
867131,leaf4,2014-08-11 23:50:00,2466,"A truly tragic loss, I will forever remember him from all the childhood memories he brought to the tv screen, and I really liked his sitcom ""The Crazy Ones"" too. Rest in peace"
867137,Gerritt,2014-08-12 00:27:00,6129,Yup.... A comedic icon of a generation gone... Heard rumours he was working on mrs. Doubtfire 2...  Truely a family friendly funny actor.  G

867140,Terry,2014-08-12 00:49:00,14456,too bad I heard he fell back off the wagon   Robin Williams - Weapons Of Self Destruction  
867144,porkpie,2014-08-12 00:58:00,2521,"It's not to often the passing of a celebrity phases me, but I truly enjoyed his acting and his comedy. A truly multi talented individual. Rest in peace RW!"
867146,bigugli,2014-08-12 01:11:00,6138,"This just plain SUCKS!. I loved his off the wall antics, his rants and his intellectual humour.  He was also a very talented actor beyond his comedies.  All I can say.....   ""Oh Captain! My Captain!""......"
867148,wall i,2014-08-12 01:18:00,48,His performance in Good Will Hunting has that film in my top 10. Great entertainer.
867149,Tim Mills,2014-08-12 01:23:00,476,Shame.  I enjoyed his work in Good Will Hunting and Good Morning Vietnam.
867152,kickingfrog,2014-08-12 01:29:00,8333,I only knew him as a comic actor until I saw Awakenings. I realized that his talent wasn't just being funny.
867155,SirCranksalot,2014-08-12 01:51:00,3291,I read years ago that he was bipolar(manic depressive). Really sad. 1 of the very best--- a brilliant guy!
867159,Christopheraaron,2014-08-12 02:13:00,3525,"Damn, I had almost gotten this out of my mind after I was told about it a couple hours ago. Really liked his standup. RIP Robin."
867162,Musky or Specks,2014-08-12 02:26:00,2710,"He didn't have demons or issues he had a disease, the sooner we all recognize that this is an illness the sooner we can remove the stigmatisms that come with it and treat it as an actual health problem. My condolences to his family, he was a great artist."
867165,4x4bassin,2014-08-12 02:37:00,1025,"What a shame , RIP Robin"
867237,Gerry,2014-08-12 14:35:00,257,"Absolutely right Musky, it is an illness that can be treated....most of the time. Has nothing to do with being ""wealthy and unhappy"". Very sad to see such talent lost."
867241,Steelheadphycho,2014-08-12 14:49:00,470, +1  There is way too little emphasis payed to mental health.
