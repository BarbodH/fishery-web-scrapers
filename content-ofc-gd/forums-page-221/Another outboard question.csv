866779,Joeytier,2014-08-08 00:33:00,3990,"I picked up a nice condition 1970 viking 6 hp outboard a couple weeks ago for my 12 footer.  The first time I had it out it would run quite well at speed but idled very rough with lots of sputtering.  I did some research on the motor and adjusted the premix and added seafoam and lead substitute, and had it out again for a night trolling.  I was impressed by how well it idled, and trolled down beautifully all night, however my top end has dropped drastically (close to 50%).  I consistently noticed that if I throttled up too fast it would struggle to find gas and sputter out, but if I go slowly it will eventually find the gas, but certainly not where it should be.  Any idea as to what is causing this?  I am guessing it is fuel delivery issue?"
866782,Bernie,2014-08-08 00:38:00,3190,The Seafoam most likely loosened up some debris and it ended up in the high speed fuel circuit in the carb partially blocking fuel supply.
866797,Freshtrax,2014-08-08 03:13:00,2215,i'd pull the carb and clean it out propper..
866822,chris.brock,2014-08-08 15:03:00,4053,Bernie's a good guy to have around here for sure  let's see a picture of this beast Joey
866849,Sinker,2014-08-08 19:43:00,8692,"I'd taker for another good rip and see if it will blow out. Sometimes the seafoam takes a while to work things out of the system. No doubt, there is lots of crud worked out of it. If that fails, its time for a proper carb clean and set up.  S."
866877,ecmilley,2014-08-09 01:56:00,2163,How olds the fuel line? Had a few real old ones disintegrate inside and plug up everything hows the glass bowl fuel filter look under the cover. If ok what bernie said
866898,Old Ironmaker,2014-08-09 13:14:00,8243,"If I had a 44 year old wall hanger and it started I would over the Moon. Neat find, super bonus she runs at all. I wonder if it's worth more to a collector. Sell it for big money and buy something newer. I wouldn't. Man it is so cool when I see an oldie but goldie pushing a 50 year old Sears car topper. Please be gentle to her. Heck she must be 80 in outboard motor years!"
866932,Joeytier,2014-08-09 21:19:00,3990,"Fuel lines are fine(look damn near new actually), haven't checked for weak spark but I suspect thats a nonissue and that it's a high speed jet issue.  Funny that I have the exact sane goddamn problem on my big bear now.  It's a shame that I hate tinkering with old motors, or else I might be having a little bit of fun with this..."
866939,Big Cliff,2014-08-09 23:50:00,6899,"Once it ""finds it's fuel"" as you put it, does it seem to be ok on the top end (other than slower). I am just wondering if when you adjusted the low speed you leaned it a bit too much. I would try turning the low speed jet back out about 1/8 of a turn and see if that improves it."
866940,Joeytier,2014-08-09 23:55:00,3990,I haven't had the carb apart at all.
866943,Freshtrax,2014-08-10 04:13:00,2215,"Clean the carb out proper, or risk  burning it down.   No fuel and two stoke = melted pistons."
