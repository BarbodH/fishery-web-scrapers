866964,Joeytier,2014-08-10 16:53:00,3990,Go cast a crankbait around whitby marina
866969,Rodbender,2014-08-10 17:31:00,1027,Was out with the camera today(bird photography) looks like the salmon are close to shore seen some big ones jumping and minnows all over the place cast some spoons in the big pond
866974,Locnar,2014-08-10 18:04:00,645,"I've done the Whitby Marina thing to no avail enough times... plus I'm livin in Courtice now. I've also tried the Oshawa harbour a few times with no luck. I haven't tried the Oshawa pier, if the salmon are starting to stage then that could be an option. McLaughlin bay seems to be only good in the spring."
866975,Rodbender,2014-08-10 18:07:00,1027,Your not aloud to fish McLaughlin bay it's a nature reserve opps thats second marsh
866977,Locnar,2014-08-10 18:12:00,645,Second MArsh is a fish and wildlife reserve... Mclaughlin is open.
866979,Black_Blade,2014-08-10 18:25:00,258,"Part of the reason I'm glad not to live in Oshawa anymore, having to travel distances for decent fishing.  Up here, being 5 minutes from great fishing and little farther for free camping..    I used to like heading up to Pigeon Lake (Emily PP), always enjoyed that, until got tired of the tons of goose poop along the beach area...lol."
