Asked me to join him this coming weekend and considering how vast an area it is I was wondering if those who have fished and/or have knowledge of the Bay would be willing to share any info. Many thanks in advance to your replies."

The big pike are also out in the deeper water. Bass seem to stay a bit more reasonably closer to the mainland.
