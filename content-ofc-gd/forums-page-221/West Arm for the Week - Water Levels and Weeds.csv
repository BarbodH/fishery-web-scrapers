866824,BillsTheBassMan,2014-08-08 15:05:00,932,Hey OFC!  I'm about to head north for a week on the west side of the west arm.  Just wanted to touch base quick and inquire about the water levels and weedgrowth.  Is the cabbage finally thick?  Are water levels still relatively high?  I'll be taking my boat and don't want any nasty surprises.  Hopefully the toothy critters are active and I'll have a pretty great report when I'm back.  Ryan
866831,woodenboater,2014-08-08 16:03:00,2277,"have a great time and hope you get into lots of pike and bass....and I guess some pickereyes as well lol. and pics, you know we just  LURV pics here ha ha"
866833,Headhunter,2014-08-08 16:36:00,5703,"Can't really help with the West Arm, but I was on the French, near Alban, the second week of July and the water levels were at normal seasonal levels. The weed growth at that time was said to be a month behind normal growth. Best guess would be things are more like July up there, than August. Hope that helps. HH"
866834,doubleheader,2014-08-08 16:42:00,497,Where you headn? We're  going to Memquisit and leaving in 14 hours.
866846,BillsTheBassMan,2014-08-08 19:17:00,932,"We're going to a cottage west of 64 and leaving 7am.  Yeah......""pike."""
866848,BillsTheBassMan,2014-08-08 19:36:00,932,"TBH that's what I was expecting.  I thought maybe a little higher than normal, early July conditions.  Thanks for the info."
866865,Dan668,2014-08-08 21:34:00,1120,"I was on the french canada day weekend, weed growth was way behind. Good luck,  they weren't biting than."
866866,16 Footer,2014-08-08 21:58:00,191,I was at West Arm east of 64 for a few days just after Canada Day. The water levels looked normal and the fishing was not good. The scenery was great.
866871,Rich Clemens,2014-08-09 00:35:00,3131,"We are on the west arm now.   Water levels are near normal, but the weeds are still behind.   Fishing 8' of water, weeds are mostly still a few feet down.   Much better than in June, but not near what they have been in past years.  Fishing was tough this past week.   Good luck."
866881,BillsTheBassMan,2014-08-09 03:03:00,932,Well in my experience every boat up there jigging around has slow fishing.   If you're after pike you usually do ok.  Musky as always are on and off.  I won't be pickerel hunting.   I'd rather catch carp.
