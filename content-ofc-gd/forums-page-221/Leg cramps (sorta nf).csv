867270,Old Ironmaker,2014-08-12 19:23:00,8243,"Grimsbylander.  Quote button not working but you are bang on. We would train specifically for our spring trip 17 hours north. It entailed walking the bush carrying 9.9's and gas cans plus all the equipment into fly in lakes. Then portaging 14' ers and everything over beaver dams. You better be in tip top condition to do that. More than 1 partner never made it in. We told them it wasn't easy. Same as hauling a big Moose out of a swamp. I wouldn't even think about doing that anymore.  Getting yourself in shape for being out on the water more than for the occasional weekend is the most important thing. I don't mean to say Joey isn't in shape, you sure look to be. I better shut up now before I really put my foot in my mouth,,,,,,,, again!"
867368,mrpike,2014-08-13 06:00:00,151,posted twice sorry. 
867369,mrpike,2014-08-13 06:08:00,151,"I was just told about this.      when your legs cramp up touch your tongue with a bit of table salt  . Put a little table salt on your finger then touch your tongue , The cramps will stop right away. THIS really works.    I now keep a little salt be side my bed at night . try it it really works and its so fast .   I don't know why it works but it does."

Seriously though when I tell someone we went out all day fishing. They think it's a relaxing day in a boat. Yea right, fish for 6 hours in 3 foot chop fight the wind, waves and a few 10 pound walleye on Erie, load the boat back onto the trailer, clean it out of fresh fish guts, clean a few and cook them and tell me that's not a real workout. Relaxing in a different way. I can't do it 2 days in a row anymore, no way."
867372,glen,2014-08-13 07:00:00,2641,For me Gatorade or Gatorade g2 goes down way easier then water.  Helps on a long day on the water.
867179,Joey,2014-08-12 04:01:00,9122,"Anybody ever get leg cramps after a week of fishing?   I seem to suffer from them after the first few days after fishing if we go away for a week.  Wakes me up in the middle of the night and they are paiinfull.  Anybody, if you have a solution, I'd love to hear it!  Joey"
867180,Roy,2014-08-12 04:08:00,13728,It's why I'm up right now...
867181,Musky or Specks,2014-08-12 04:14:00,2710,Try a magnesium supplimant I find it helps
867182,Joey,2014-08-12 04:18:00,9122,It's why I'm up right now...  me too babe
867184,Joey,2014-08-12 04:20:00,9122,"I take magnesium every day, but this seems to  only affect me after a fishing trip.   Weird."
867185,Wagoneer,2014-08-12 04:29:00,118,"Eat a banana! balancing on a boat uses tons of little muscles that aren't regularly used. There's 600mg of potassium in a single banana, that helps wonders with stopping overstressed muscles from cramping up and gets rid of that restless feeling. If you're already taking magnesium then having more potassium will work even better."
867186,DRIFTER_016,2014-08-12 04:36:00,10439,And drink lots of fluids. I find I cramp up way more if I neglect the fluids.
867189,Canuck,2014-08-12 05:12:00,491,"Drifter is bang-on. Its dehydration.  You need to bring and drink lots of fluids.  A couple bottles of Gator-aid help a lot (buy the powder and mix it yourself).  I think you will also feel less ""bagged"" after a day on the water if you keep the fluids going in."
867195,JamesG,2014-08-12 10:04:00,32,"When I wake up with my calf cramping I just stand up and it goes away instantly.  I do think its to do with dehydration, I try and drink a glass of water before I goto bed every night to prevent them."
867197,misfish,2014-08-12 10:20:00,29133,Lots and lots of water J as mentioned. Also try bringing Gatorade out with you. You want to keep those electrolytes  in your system as well.. Maybe start fishing from a pontoon. LOL KEEP THOSE LEGS MOVING.
867207,bigugli,2014-08-12 11:47:00,6138,"Tonic water will also help with muscle cramping by upping your fluids and the low dose of quinny found in it. Just have to find a way around the bitter taste. OH, that's what the gin is for."
867213,Mike Pike,2014-08-12 12:30:00,1332,"Lying on you back, straighten out your cramping leg, and flex your ankle and point your toes back towards your head as much as you can.  Hold position until the cramping subsides.  Helps me all the time.  I learned it from scuba diving, when you get a leg cramp, you straighten your leg, grab the tip of your fin and pull it back towards you."
867214,porkpie,2014-08-12 12:40:00,2521,This guy is right!  Lots of water!!
867218,Walleye72,2014-08-12 12:53:00,156,"Lying on you back, straighten out your cramping leg, and flex your ankle and point your toes back towards your head as much as you can.  Hold position until the cramping subsides.  This is what I do.  It usually takes several minutes before it goes away, but at least with my leg extended comletely it's not so painful.  Also, the banana advice is solid.  I ate a couple after my first charley horse a few days into my vacation a few weeks ago and it never came back.   I'd try Gatorade if you don't like bananas.  It's funny how you posted that you only get them after fishing, (vacation).  It is the same for me."
867223,highdrifter,2014-08-12 13:08:00,2534,"I hear ya Joey..  I got the worst leg tension that prevents me from sleeping sometimes...   We're reeling in the years!!  Have ya tried stretching??  I spend a few minutes stretching every night before I hit the sack..  Stand up, keep your legs straight and try to touch your toes...  Keep at it until you feel your muscles start to relax.  I try to do it until my palms touch the floor..  cheers luv, HD"
867230,fishing n autograph,2014-08-12 13:55:00,2540,If the cramping is in your calf head to see your doctor. If you're standing or sitting for long periods you could be developing blood clots in your calfs. I had a scare with that earlier this year and was diagnosed with venous reflux disease in my left leg. I now have cramps that can get bad like I've been stabbed with a hot poker. I now have to wear compression socks
867239,Freshtrax,2014-08-12 14:39:00,2215,http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=LdGai72Tt8Y  A funny video on the topic.
867245,Crazy Ivan,2014-08-12 15:01:00,184,"You are most likely lacking vitamins. Try some whole food supplements, you can get them at places like natures emporium. They will be $$$. Don't waste your time with common drug store vitamins (synthetic) they do nothing.  Drinking lots of fluids helped me as well, but since I've been on the quality supplements the cramps have gone. Also helped with other issues.  Pm me if you like and I'll be more specific about the brand."
867255,Old Ironmaker,2014-08-12 16:23:00,8243,In the summer our trainer used to have dozens of Bananas on hand. Those have been replaced with Gatorade. Stretching the muscle in the opposite direction as it's natural flex will send the cramp to sleep. I might see a Dr. if it persists.
867258,Mike Pike,2014-08-12 16:46:00,1332,"Joey, here is a recommendation from Blue Jays player Kawasaki!!!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdGai72Tt8Y"
867264,fishnsled,2014-08-12 18:09:00,3520,"And drink lots of fluids. I find I cramp up way more if I neglect the fluids.  As many have said above, hydrate yourself - and not with alcohol.      I've heard that bananas help as well but do we really want bananas in the boat?      I use to get them really bad and found I wasn't drinking nearly enough.  I couldn't tell you the last time I had one just by increasing my water intake."
867265,grimsbylander,2014-08-12 18:15:00,3016,"I'm not saying this is the case with you specifically but for most people we're guilty of not preparing our bodies for the rigors of our chosen sport. Getting a treadmill or elliptical machine and training for the fishing season sounds funny but I can tell you it helps a lot. I've done it for years. For me, it began with bowhunting. I found that if I training all summer I had a much easier time with the walking, climbing and shooting during cold temperatures. Getting into your stand ""sweat free"" in super important. Standing in a semi-ready position balancing against wave action and moving around in the boat for 3-8 hours is not normal activity. My opinion...get active before the season and stay hydrated. You'll be way more comfortable and your heart will probably take you fishing a few extra years."
867266,Fisherman,2014-08-12 18:21:00,7201,"Oh boy, what a subject for me to find.  Last week they had a documentary on of all things but Gatorade and granola bars and energy bars, etc.  The biggest load of bull granola that you can imagine.  It's nothing more than marketing by use of sports to encourage it.  End result, the human body has quite the capable system to regulate it's own electrolytes.  One particular athelete that rode a statioary bike in the uphill mode for over 2 hours at a grueling pace was just, barely starting to show depeltion signs.  As for the energy and granola bars, another over hyped sports media, shove it down your throat baloney.  End solution was to maintain your body fluid levels by drinking pain old water and not even the stuff that comes in plastic bottles, just out of the tap.  Don't like the chlorine, run it through a Brita filter."
867268,Rustic-Fisher,2014-08-12 18:51:00,826,"Roll those legs out with a rolling pin , seriously or a foam roller. Excess lactic acid in any muscle tissue reeks havoc , cramps , spasms , general tightness . Hydration and nutrition are paramount also."
867269,bigbuck,2014-08-12 19:00:00,2449,"Joey, just take care of it old school. Drink plenty of water while out on the water and eat a banana at some point. Everything you need to avoid the cramps is in there. If it continues, could be something else and see your doc. Now get back out and slime that purty boat you guys have."
