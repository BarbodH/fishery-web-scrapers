866435,BassMan11,2014-08-05 14:50:00,583,Great stuff guys. Some good info here.  As for a weapon 2 of my friends are bringing shotguns as partridge opens the day before we get up there. That should suffice on scaring away any pesky bears we come across. It looks like I have a lot of this stuff already on the list. Good to know my head is in the right spot packing wise.

Great if there is an open season and there is a hunter in the group, usually there is always a 2 sport guy or gal in the crew. But when there isn't I'd rather stand in front of a Judge alive than be a dead law abiding fisherman."

866740,4x4bassin,2014-08-07 15:10:00,1025,I will keep adding items along the way as I think of them - small pack of dental floss ( stuck piece of steak in the teeth can be annoying after a couple days) - tweezers ( embedded slivers can be a problem after a couple days as well )

866812,Fang,2014-08-08 12:56:00,1330,"from spending a number of years at the family camp on Temagami I see many guests who overlook these simple items  Zip-loc bags (one with some toilet paper for the boat) roll of aluminum foil Knife sharpener anitseptic cream spices to help flavor meals BBQ sauce or salad dressings as toppings for fish/steak - There is nothing better than a little ranch dressing on fresh cooked fish Always fun to have a small bottle of hot sauce for when the scotch comes out  and for me, the must haves are ear plugs small reading flashlight (LED Head lamp preferred) good flashlight over 100 lumens glow in the dark stick from dollar store (hang in the cabin at night to make midnight trips outside easier) 2 way radios but one that has a weather channel (hate to have a boat on dead water when other are on the bite) as mentioned - pack of baby wipes can be worth their weight in gold  I also take up a small speaker that can plug into my phone for music and there are AA battery adapters out there to power your phones to play music  My next add on is a small form pack in guitar, seen a few but haven't heard one that sells itself to me yet. The Martin backpacker is close. Brought my acoustic on a fly-in north of temagami a few years back and had paddlers camping across from us clapping after each song and shouting requests across the bay"

865728,BassMan11,2014-07-31 11:14:00,583,"It seems that fly-in trip season is well underway. I have one coming up in September out of 7 Lakes in Nakina and want to be as prepared as possible for the drive and the trip itself. Is there anything in particular that is a must bring that is maybe out of the norm? It could be for the fishing, boat, cabin, or the ride up. I would think with the list I have been making since March that I have almost everything covered but I am sure some of the veteran fly-in guys might have something to add.  Don"
865735,solopaddler,2014-07-31 12:00:00,8605,"Hi Don, amazingly I don't have a list but off the top of my head:  -couple cans of Seafoam (often the motors run rough - they tend to mix the gas on the rich side) -spark plug wrench and sandpaper -adjustable wrench and a couple of screwdrivers -duct tape (has a million uses) -can of indoor Raid to spray cabin before sleeping (preferred over coils, it takes 5 minutes and works great) -bring a twin mattress sheet for each person along with your sleeping bag. (the mattresses can be gross) -MSR water pump and 1L Nalgene bottles for clean drinking water -clamp on rod holders for trolling -make sure you have extra batteries for your fish finder or if the camp has a genny bring your charger -an extra coleman lantern (these camps are notoriously dim) -pack non perishable food items in cardboard boxes. You can burn them at camp and have one less big empty container to bring home.  I'll chime in later with more ideas."
865736,fisherman7,2014-07-31 12:13:00,325,"After this month's trip, double the amount of mosquito coils you think you'll need, extra mantles for the camp lanterns, fly strips - we forgot them one year and the flies in the cabin drove us crazy, extra fishing line in case you get spooled, spare rod and reel, 50' of rope (anchor lines, boat lines, clothes lines etc), golf towel - I put in in the boat to dry my hands, hand creme (no jokes fellas) as I find that having wet hands that are nicked from fish and hooks makes my hands a mess.  That's all I can think of beyond the usual.  One more thing - an extra day of food in case the plane can't get in due to weather.  Also, as per the above post highly recommend Sea Foam!"
865738,solopaddler,2014-07-31 12:40:00,8605,"-Paper plates and bowls. Who wants to wash dishes when you're on vacation? Burn them when you're done. -A giant sponge (Canadian Tire sells them) Invaluable for sopping up water in the boat and cleaning the crap on the floor. -If I'm cooking a lot of fish, especially deep frying, I always bring a collander with a tight hole pattern. Once the oil has cooled strain it back into the jug using a funnel. It can be reused."

Good list and I cant really add anything new but can definitely say that baby wipes and duct tape are always on the list . As well no matter what time of year I will always have bug spray . I have seen bugs as bad in September as in May so you never know ! I will also take a boat motor kit with me that has various things in it that if anything basic breaks down , it can be fixed . Been on a couple trips where the outboard has broken down in the middle of no where with no way to fix it . Never again !!! Several lighters or waterproof matches too ."

A common item below the border on all remote trips. It was a bit un nerving the first time I saw a cousin with a 357 holstered to his belt on a trip in the Smokey Mountains in Georgia many, many years back. We have a different social attitude here about what is needed for protection in the wilderness. Weapons are common for remote hunting trips. I need protection from wildlife when fishing as well. I brought Bear spray the last fly-in I was involved with."

866433,fishnsled,2014-08-05 14:46:00,3520,That is one heck of a list Adam!!    We always bring a tarp big enough to use as an awning at the front of the cabin.  Provides shade from the sun and protection from the rain.  Eye screws and zip ties to secure to the cabin and rope to tie of to the trees.  A rod tube for center support for height and rain run off.  Have only had to do this a couple of times but well worth it.  Rope is much lighter that bungee cords as well.
