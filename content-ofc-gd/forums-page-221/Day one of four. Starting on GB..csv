So we decide to go to G Bay for some rigg,n and hit some pike and bass after,  Marked loads of fish,but they didnt seem to want to play. Well one did.  After a few hours of watching a screen that looked like it was on simulater, we decided to pull up and head for some bass and pike..  Didnt take long til we were on them. A couple of fish on, and couple of lost spinner baits and tubes to the toothy critters. Terry got him a nice pike and I a bass and a pike on a tube. All released til the last pike. Terrys mrs,s want a pike fry,so we kept the last one of the day.  Day one was in the books and it was as always, an entertaining day.  Thanks PAL  "
