866153,phin#9,2014-08-03 15:19:00,13,Just got back from a two week holiday on Nipissing where I fished off and on in the rain and got soaked. Any suggestions on rain gear. Thanks in advance for any help.
866154,kickingfrog,2014-08-03 15:34:00,8333,"There are a few options. Personally, I don't worry about staying dry in the middle of summer. I do however wear clothes that dry very quickly. Jeans and cotton are the worst.  For under a $100 you can get any number of plastic suits that will keep the rain off of you. The down side is that you also stand a good chance of sweating so much that you're no better off then if you didn't wear anything especially in the summer, but for the occasionally use they are very useful and economical.  I have the guidewear from Cabela's (bib and jacket) works great. They were on sale a few years ago and I saved a few hundred dollars.  If you're not using it much it's hard to justify spending $300-400 for the good stuff."
866156,BillM,2014-08-03 15:40:00,17367,You want something cheap that will keep you dry and you won't sweat to death?   Frog Togs.
866162,NANUK,2014-08-03 16:25:00,797,"Watch for cabelas end of season sale on their Guidewear rain jackets & bibs, It doesn't get much better than that."
866166,mattp33,2014-08-03 16:57:00,290,I picked up a shimano suit at can tire and it's actually pretty good. I may upgrade to a basspro 100mph set this winter tho  For the money you can't beat the shimano suit
866322,Lucky Linda,2014-08-04 19:12:00,93,I bought Frog Togg bibs!  Just before we went to Nipigon. Love them!!! Dry comfy not too hot! Washed them when I got home as they were full of fish slime etc and hung to dry. Wash well!  I chose to buy the Gander Mountain jacket (guide series) and it was excellent.

866394,Kingsalmon,2014-08-05 03:00:00,107,"Watch for cabelas end of season sale on their Guidewear rain jackets & bibs, It doesn't get much better than that. Just came back from Chicago and stopped in the Hammond, Indiana store.  They had in-store specials on the Guide wear jackets.  Bought three jackets that were $299 each, but got them for $97.49 each.  This price was posted on the rack and the register was not aware of it, but they honoured the posted price anyway.  Actually, most of the Guidewear extreme stuff is on sale now online at $199.00 each for the jacket and bibs, so you might want to look into that.  I would inquire if Cabelas Barrie would price match, but sadly, i doubt it."
866453,mcdougy,2014-08-05 17:31:00,274,I see lebaron sells a rapala suit that isn't a bad price. It's new for this fall and in the fall catalogue.
866516,phin#9,2014-08-05 22:54:00,13,Thanks for the suggestions. A rain suit doesn't seem important when fishing or golfing until it starts raining . Then it's too late.lol
866576,Dave Bailey,2014-08-06 13:01:00,1641,Spray all your clothing with this stuff: http://www.neverwet.com/ I plan on trying it.
866579,BillM,2014-08-06 13:24:00,17367,Spray all your clothing with this stuff: http://www.neverwet.com/ I plan on trying it.  Have you heard of what this stuff does to clothing?  I wouldn't be spraying it on anything you value.
866584,NANUK,2014-08-06 13:46:00,797,"Bad reviews on that ""Neverwet"" stuff"
866641,Lape0019,2014-08-06 19:52:00,647,"I got a 100mph suit a few years ago and won't be buying anything cheap ever again. If I would have just bought this setup at the beginning, I would have been further ahead.  Cabelas guidewear is in the same price range. You would be happy with either"

866662,Dave Bailey,2014-08-06 22:20:00,1641," Have you heard of what this stuff does to clothing?  I wouldn't be spraying it on anything you value.   Okay, I'll spray it on myself and go nude. I grew up in the 60s, I fear no chemical!"

866686,akaShag,2014-08-07 00:50:00,2073,"I bought my ""main"" rain jacket in the 80s from Mountain Equipment Co-op and it still keeps me dry and NOT sweaty.  MEC sells quality stuff and their advertising is brutally honest.  HTH  Doug"
866708,fishindevil,2014-08-07 08:10:00,6254,I as well have the shimano gore-tex rain suit and it's insulated for cold weather fall & spring fishing and I have a north 49 Canadian tire suit for warm weather rain and they both do well !!! But yes for the colder months don't cheap out & buy a quality suit !!!! The last they work keep you dry and keep you fishing all day in late October in pouring cold rain & wind !!!!
