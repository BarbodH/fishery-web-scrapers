My quantum Cabo finally has run it's course and looks like I can not get the parts I need to fix it....  I'm thinking about getting the 6:1 as a ""do everything"" reel instead of the 5:1 or 7:1....  Let me know what you think  Mike"
867411,Lunkerhunter,2014-08-13 15:52:00,455,The lexa is nice and can handle some abuse however I do not like that the level wind does not go back and forth when casting. It has dug into the side of the spool a few times on me when castings with it not centred.  I would highly recommend the okuma Komodo. It is a bit smaller than the lexa 400 but much nicer in my opinion. I have put it to the test this summer and it's standing up very well. I prefer it over my lexa. Not as nice as a revo toro though so I would still say the toro is up there with the Calcutta for number 1 reel

It can handle big believers,  depth raiders, smaller cowgirls etc with ease.  Seems to be the best low profile reel for the money.  Would have bought a 400 if they had stock,  extremely happy with the 300.  6.3 ratio is a good all round reel.  7.1 if you throw a lot of bucktails etc."
