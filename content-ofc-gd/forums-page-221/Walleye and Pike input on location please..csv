866958,Joeytier,2014-08-10 14:45:00,3990,"A couple of my neighbors have camps there, looks like you experienced what it's known for"
866976,wvmedic,2014-08-10 18:10:00,144,"Thanks Sandy, I met a couple guy's at the bait shop. They are from southern Ontario, and was heading to Laniel to put in at the government dock. Not sure where they were staying but they were running two black Lunds a 17 and a 16, nice guys.  Joeytier, I'm already planning next years trip. Might have to make it an annual trip for sure. It is in the bush for sure, not for everyone and I like that. A six hour round trip to town is discouraging for some.  Jeff"
867061,Whopper,2014-08-11 12:22:00,2174,Great to hear you had a good time Jeff !  Thanks for sharing your pics
867202,wvmedic,2014-08-12 10:51:00,144,"Thanks Whopper, I certainly did have a good time."
867396,Governator,2014-08-13 14:31:00,879,"Nice fish looks like a great time!  I also like the floater you added to your lip grabber, I must do this with mine lol."
867399,jimmer,2014-08-13 14:42:00,2730,Obviously a successful fishing trip if you are already planning for next year. It is very addictive to fish wilderness areas that hold lots of fish. Nice looking catches!
867408,wvmedic,2014-08-13 15:38:00,144,"Governator, the float worked well. I might use one a couple inches longer though. It's a good thing it was there, the guy in the one picture holding the big Walleye landed that Pike for me. I brought it along side of the boat and John lipped it, the Pike started head shaking and threw my hooks. So the gripper was all that was holding it, well it started another head shake and pulled the gripper right out of John's hand into the drink. John was quick on the grab, but the float kept it buoyant enough to allow him the few seconds it took to grab it.  Coinsadently, I lost two fish larger than the ones in the picture. First was a Walleye bigger than the one John caught, it was what he guessed to be a 30 inch Walleye. I trust John's estimate, he has been fishing for Walleye a long time and has a few ten pounders under his belt. Any way I get it to the side of the boat, John hollers huge Walleye and says Kevin get the net. Kevin, the tall man in the pictures above, remains seated attempting to net the fish. The old Walleye makes a dive so I let the drag do it's job. After the run I again swing it to the front of the boat, it tries to go under the boat as he is trying to net it and snap. Off it goes, we gave him mild grief the rest of the trip saying he knocked it off because he didn't want me drinking out of the big fish mug the next day.  Then the next one, I hook onto something nice. Had my pole bent pretty good and it felt heavy, as I'm reeling it in I couldn't feel any head shakes and it kept diving. I said guy's this is a nice Pike, finally get it to the boat and man is it a nice one. Probably had 4 pounds on the one above, it dives hard when it sees the boat. John yells to Kevin, get the grippers. I turn and give John a funny look, but go with it. I get the Pike back to the boat and Kevin tries to grip it, it starts thrashing around and he has ahold of the leader, as he has seen both John and I do. I say no, let go. To late line snaps and the big Pike heads south in a hurry, to which John looks at me and says sorry...  Kevin did redeem himself though, he and I were alone when I hooked the Laker. So he was the only net man I had, I brought it along side of the boat and slowed him down and talked him thru it. He did a great job obviously as we have a picture of it and it tasted very good also.  jammer, it was both successful and fun. This was my first real wilderness experience, but I really liked my first trip to the bush.  Jeff"
838808,wvmedic,2014-02-27 19:30:00,144,"Hello all.  I'm looking for a fishing vacation for the Wife and I. We have stayed at Lakeair and fished the west arm, and we are again looking for a fishing vacation in the  beautiful Canadian Shield.  I've been looking at the islands of Georgian Bay north of Perry Sound,  possibly the French River area and the west arm. I prefer to camp and rent a boat, so which of the three areas would be our best choice? The scenery is almost as important as the fishing.  Or would you recommend another location in the general area Toronto north to North Bay? Thinking late August or mid to late June.  Thanks, Jeff."
838809,BillM,2014-02-27 19:34:00,17367,French River delta would be the ticket..
838830,jimmer,2014-02-27 20:16:00,2730,Mid to late June would be better than any date in August. It's hard to get to the French river delta on your own. You would have to rent a place and have them take you from Hartley Bay Marina. It is one of the most beautiful places though as BillM says.
838843,solopaddler,2014-02-27 21:25:00,8605,pm sent
838939,wvmedic,2014-02-28 02:49:00,144,"Thanks for the info folks, I look into some places on the French.  Jeff"
838945,solopaddler,2014-02-28 02:56:00,8605,"Thanks for the info folks, I look into some places on the French.  Jeff  Hey Jeff bear in mind if you rent a boat to navigate down the lower French you're only allowed to go so far for insurance and liability reasons.  You're fine if you stay in the Ox bay area and explore a bit up and down from there."
838963,Freshtrax,2014-02-28 05:33:00,2215,Factor in the price if a new prop in boat rental costs on the lower French.  Well worth it.
838966,Nipfisher,2014-02-28 06:24:00,2449,Look into Lake Temagami. Only another 50 minutes from North Bay.
839280,wvmedic,2014-03-02 13:46:00,144,"Thanks again everyone for the replies,  I am sorry for not getting back sooner.  I have been very busy at work, but I am thankful for the information and your taking the time to help me.  Jeff"
839367,sofabed,2014-03-03 00:40:00,119,if your looking for a closer location you could try Balsam Lake has good numbers of both pike and walleye
839437,Sinker,2014-03-03 15:20:00,8692,"Look at the land O lakes area. Beautiful country, great fishing, and often over looked.  I find the whole french river area gets busy IMO. Land O lakes, your hard pressed to even see another boat on a lot of the lakes.  S."
839440,BillM,2014-03-03 15:34:00,17367,"I find the whole french river area gets busy IMO. Land O lakes, your hard pressed to even see another boat on a lot of the lakes.  S.  You're fishing the wrong part of the French if you are seeing more then 2-3 boats in a single day...."
839441,woodenboater,2014-03-03 15:35:00,2277,"Factor in the price if a new prop in boat rental costs on the lower French. Well worth it.  ^^^^  and I might add, pretty well most of the French River  If you hit the Lower French (literally and figuratively), understand that it's a provincial park as well so there will be camping fees per person / per night. This will add up."
861461,wvmedic,2014-07-03 16:54:00,144,"Well I thought I might update a little.  I got a spot on a boat with a friend, going to the Kipawa region of Quebec. We will be camping and fishing in the Zec Kipawa, it's not an Ontario trip. It is still a Canadian adventure though, we will be arriving in Temiscaming on the 30th of this month. Plan to stay the night there then take care of our fees the morning of the 31st then a two in a half hour drive to the lake. Load up the boats and head to an island to setup camp, fish till the 7th of August and pack up and head home on the 8th.  I am as excited as a kid on Christmas eve.  Jeff"
861462,jimmer,2014-07-03 17:18:00,2730,Good luck. I just got back from our Quebec trip that was north of Kipawa. It was awesome and the scenery was beautiful. No shortage of fish either. You will have a blast!!!
861463,Whopper,2014-07-03 18:13:00,2174,Good Luck Jeff
861605,wvmedic,2014-07-04 17:21:00,144,Thanks jimmer and Whopper.
861780,little mountain,2014-07-06 02:44:00,16,i think you are making a good choice. myself and a few buddies are going to smithbay outfitters on lake kipawa in two weeks. i met the owner a few yrs back and am finally getting there. large numbers of walleye with several over five lbs is normal. lake trout and pike are plentiful as well. cant wait
861813,tbayboy,2014-07-06 14:39:00,1497,Just got back from Kipawa myself. Staying at a lodge vs camping it'll be very different and I'm not sure if you're actually going to be on Lac Kipawa or another in the Zec but you're going to have a great time (bugs and the odd thunder storm aside).
861878,wvmedic,2014-07-07 02:35:00,144,"little mountain, thanks and good luck on you trip. Have fun...  TbayBoy, thank you. We will be camping in the Zec and fishing one of the Zec lakes."
866925,wvmedic,2014-08-09 20:11:00,144,"Got back home yesterday, had a blast and caught some good numbers of Walleye and Pike.Thought I'd post a couple pictures, the large Walleye and Pike went back in to be caught again another day.Jeff"
866934,Joeytier,2014-08-09 21:45:00,3990,"I saw those pictures and instantly thought of Kipawa, not surprising that's where you are.  Which Zec were you in?  Very nice fish btw"
866950,Rod Caster,2014-08-10 12:15:00,5784,You picked the right spot! Looks like some great fishing!
866956,wvmedic,2014-08-10 14:02:00,144,"Joeytier, we were in the Zec Kipawa on Lac Ostaboningue. Not as scenic as Nipissing in my opinion and the drive was farther. But the fishing was very good, I think I could get used to it.  Rod Caster I think the spot might be a good one, and we had a fun time.  Jeff"
866957,little mountain,2014-08-10 14:28:00,16,"nice fish Jeff. the one looks like a blue walleye. we went to Smith Bay outfitters out of Laniel on the north end of the lake. they pick us up by boat and its about a half hr ride to the camp. the camp is on a peninsula. the bay side averages about 20 ft deep and the walleye were pretty easy pickings but nothing over 17 inches. we caught 3 lakers over the slot size and 3 in the slot one afternoon. We are going back to moose hunt and fish more walleye in october. Good place, nice people i recomend it. Sandy"
