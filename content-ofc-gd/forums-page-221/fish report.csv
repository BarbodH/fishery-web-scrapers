How would you like to hear- ""where do you want to fish today?"" then pull out a map, without consideration of access or distance, that's pretty cool  it's the ultimate back lake fishing weapon    my wife and me spent the better part of a day trying to get in here last summer, paddling and portaging, and didn't even quite make it  http://ontariofishingcommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=71169&hl=secret  with wings, it's just over the trees, probably less than 10 minutes from when the little 172 fires up, until the floats touch the water again, very cool  Cam is friends with most of the province, including this camp owner, who has had a bear come in a window, leave through a door, then come in another window, rip open everything, then leave through a wall, then come in through the repaired door and leave through a repaired window etc., so a 12 gauge made the trip with us    we didn't see the bear, I did promptly step on a nail on the ""bed of nails"" the owner left to protect his camp  We grabbed a canoe from camp, paddled down the lake, tied it off, thenbushwacked to the secret lake, to some cached canoes I had found via snowmobiling, in the winter. The snow was super deep, and I didn't think the canoes were locked up but wasn't sure under the 3' of snow. Luckily the weren't locked. Away we go.  The secret lake turned out to be smallmouth only (no largies, weird), fast action, no biggies though    a hot, calm day, good for paddling, probably not so good for the bite    summer has been great, lots of fishing, mishaps- stepped on that nail, my legs are currently covered in poison ivy, and had a tick  took the tick to Minden hospital, it was a wood tick, no trouble, another kudos to the Canadian health care system, here's the pic, sac    it's not a Moosebunk or Solopaddler report, but it's something,"
867156,Freshtrax,2014-08-12 01:59:00,2215,Sounds like a great way to spend a day. Why hospital trip for the tick? Check for Lyme?
