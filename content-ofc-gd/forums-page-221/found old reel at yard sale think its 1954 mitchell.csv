866520,dave524,2014-08-05 23:03:00,4508,"The CAP was a budget model, about 2/3 the price of the 300."
866522,chris.brock,2014-08-05 23:09:00,4053,"I have ""Lawson's Price Guide To Old Fishing Reels"" in my hand, do you want to know what it says, or keep it a mystery?"
866526,skinny,2014-08-05 23:37:00,442,tell me please
866529,esoxansteel,2014-08-05 23:54:00,1307,"I have a mint Mitchell Cap 304, on my mantel with other old reels, the CAP was similar in appearance to the Luxor of the same era, like the 300 series they were state of the art at that time, and there are a good number of both CAPs and 300s in existence today, and unlike companies who discontinue making parts on reels 5 years after the reels have been discontinued , parts for those reels are still readily available"
866531,chris.brock,2014-08-06 00:11:00,4053,"Mitchell CAP, open faced spinning reel, France, excellent condition, value $26 (2001)  if it was a Mitchell Hugh Big Game 7"", it would be $1045  I inherited a big bunch of old reels, I was disappointed to find out what they are worth, I'm going to keep them anyways"
866532,misfish,2014-08-06 00:13:00,29133,Nice find. My pop has a few. Some his and the others my grandfathers. Price is not a matter.

866600,ckrb2007,2014-08-06 16:14:00,449,"About 5yrs ago I bought a 5gallon pail full of old reels for $15 at a yard sale in Barrie. If I remember, there were 10 Zebco Cardinal 4's in there along with a bunch of Mitchell 300's and 301's.....all in very good condition. Needless to say, I had a good couple weeks on ebay and in BC."

866890,skinny,2014-08-09 11:28:00,442,found the above info on the reel I'm pretty sure thats it  I see it has some first's on it and lasts
866922,Canuck2fan,2014-08-09 19:15:00,1444,Brings back some memories for me. I got a mitchell 304 as a hand me down from my dad. Great reel it always sounded like you were grinding forks in a garbage disposal but it never failed me LOL. Probably still works if I could find it among the bag of other reels I have.
