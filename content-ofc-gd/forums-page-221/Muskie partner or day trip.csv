I was wondering if there were any experienced muskie anglers on this forum to plan a day trip. I usually fish the kawarthas, or if you have a better spot in mind we could go there. I have my own quality gear and a 16.2 princecraft pro series boat or We could use your boat if you prefer. Pm me for details and to plan something!"
