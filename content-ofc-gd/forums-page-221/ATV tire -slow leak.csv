866692,captpierre,2014-08-07 02:17:00,2521,"I bought a new Honda ATV last fall.  All is well, runs like a clock.  For the last 2 months one back tire leaks slowly.  Takes about 7 days to get soft.  Took it off and put it in the lake, submerged.  Looking for bubbles.  None from anywhere.  Rims, valve or tread.  Is there something I can do or should I take it to an ATV dealer?  Thanks"

866696,porkpie,2014-08-07 02:46:00,2521,Fill with tire slime .  I used to run it in my last bike.  Lots of guys run slime in all their tires for trail riding.  I haven't heard of any issues.
866697,Paudash,2014-08-07 02:52:00,273,slime is the way to go
866703,Raf,2014-08-07 03:57:00,3495,soap and water around the usual areas usuallly finds it

866734,Rod Caster,2014-08-07 14:49:00,5784,$15-$20 to re-seat it. Likely that is the issue especially if you habitually run it at low psi

866770,Bernie,2014-08-07 23:00:00,3190,"Uggh. I hate fixing the ones with slime in them. Usually takes more time to fix them right as well. Most ATV tires I repair have crud caught between the bead and rim. I remove the tire, clean the rim and spray paint the bead surface on the rim. Then install the tire before the paint fully dries.  Careful with tubes too. ATV tires, because of the low pressure can often allow the tire to slip on the rim. If this happens it can cut the stem off the tube. Then there is no way to keep air in the tire.Raf is right on with the soap and water. Sunlight dish soap and water is best.Spray it on, let it sit for around five to ten minutes and look for small mounds of fine bubbles if it is a slow leak."
866773,DRIFTER_016,2014-08-07 23:53:00,10439,When ever I have a leak I just take it to my local tire guy for him to fix. When they install tires at his shop they put the liquid rubber stuff on the beads of the rim for a better seal. Sort of like Bernie's wet paint trick.
867272,captpierre,2014-08-12 19:35:00,2521,Just a follow-up guys.  Took the tire in to my local ATV shop.  They found a thorn in it causing the leak  Put a plug in.  $20  Badda Boom.  I'm in business  They said thorns are common.  Who'd a thought?  Thanks for all your help
