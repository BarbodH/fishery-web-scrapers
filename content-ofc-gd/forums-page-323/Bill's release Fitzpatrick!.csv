773402,lookinforwalleye,2013-03-12 22:24:00,4399,So who will be taking snaps this year?
773408,Tayzak15,2013-03-12 22:48:00,318,Better hope to god it's not Tim Tebow
773409,Tim Mills,2013-03-12 23:13:00,476,Good move.  They should try and sign Drew Stanton and draft someone to groom for the future.  Too bad they lost Levitre.  Can't believe Buddy Nix got snowed on the deadspin crank call-embarrassing for the franchise.
773419,Old Ironmaker,2013-03-13 00:03:00,8243," Ooops, I just said today I don't use acronyms because I don't know what they all mean, meant to say optional team activities."
773430,Toad Hunter,2013-03-13 00:28:00,261,"As a Fins fan, I'm only concerned because I fear who ever they pick to replace him, may not throw as many INTs when pressured lol. I am however concerned about picking up Mike Wallace from Pitts. Didn't the Fins just get rid of a player of the same style in Brandon Marshall because of his attitude only to pay more for one with less impressive stats ?"
773443,solopaddler,2013-03-13 00:54:00,8605,I'd like to see the Bill's trade for Matt Flynn of the Seahawks. He's making way too much coin to be a backup and I believe he's a player they could grow with.
773444,Tim Mills,2013-03-13 00:55:00,476,
773463,Toad Hunter,2013-03-13 01:56:00,261,"Yes, I am really happy with the re signing of Hartline, he has always proven to be reliable hands and fast too.. he could easily get another 1000 yrd season with a ""true #1"" to take alot of the heat off. And Devon Bess is as a great slot rec. as the best of them in my opinion.. but could use some yards after the catch (again, might be more possible with others covering Wallace) Im glad ""we"" tagged Starks too- he's been impressive the last 2 yrs. But I won't lie, I don't know too much about Ellerby other than the stats on paper. Looks promising but will likely come at the cost of losing Carlos Dansby. ""out with the old in with the new"" which worries me, tweaking the def. too much could be a mistake -was the only strength of the team for the last 5 yrs. the Secondreary could use a facelift that's for sure. And a pass rusher to go opp. Cam Wake would be my first choices before I looked into the LBS IMO."
773464,Toad Hunter,2013-03-13 01:57:00,261,I would like to see him Start some where as well. Mostly just to see wheather he is more than a 2 trick pony.
773467,Marko,2013-03-13 02:22:00,854,"Flynn had 5 WR to throw to in Green Bay. Bills wide recievers are not as nearly talented as Jennings, Nelson, Jones, Driver and Cobb. That being said he would be a nice addition to bills for sure"
773472,Old Ironmaker,2013-03-13 02:56:00,8243,"We really don't know how good or otherwise the Bills receiving corps are,,, they never had a chance to catch the ball before it was picked off."
773526,BucktownAngler,2013-03-13 14:31:00,582," marshall is not the same style as wallace. marshall is more of a possesion receiver using his strength to out work cbs, while wallace is a deep threat speedy receiver. who is used to stretch the field, opening up space for other receivers and the running game  also a fins fan btw. next up TE"
773632,Toad Hunter,2013-03-13 22:35:00,261,"Ya Fasano wasn't great by any means, but was usually reliable hands. So he needs to be replaced. But I am more concerned with with Def. Secon-dreary - the pass Def has been weak to say the least for far to long in a pass hungry game. I say we need a dependable corner and DB. I would also like to see Daniel Thomas get traded or released and try to pick up someone who can play more than 2 games with out getting a concussion."
773648,Rich Clemens,2013-03-13 23:42:00,3131,  Hey Hey ....  Another Dolphins fan.       Maybe Miami can train him how to catch critical passes.
773677,Toad Hunter,2013-03-14 04:09:00,261,    Good to know I haven't been suffering alone all this time
773678,Old Ironmaker,2013-03-14 04:51:00,8243," You folks don't know the meaning of suffering. how about going 0 for 4 in the big game, since  then I threw in the towel. I had not recovered from the first Super Bowl loss and was trying to recover for 4 years in a row, Now that's suffering."
773698,mattybculp,2013-03-14 13:24:00,388,I hear Ryan Leaf is available .
