The google searches I've tried have been inconsistent relative to walleye fishing; anywhere from ""it's fished out"" to ""we caught a bunch of fish"", and most of the infiormation is more than a few years old. Specifically I'm considering Ritchie's End Of Trail Lodge, which looks to have very nicely maintained cottages. I've also read horror stories about the condition of the gravel road back to the pick-up area, but the lodge owner says it's regulary maintained. Anyhow, I apprecate any feedback from those that have made the trip."
773180,solopaddler,2013-03-11 17:39:00,8605,My thought on Bisco is this. It's a decent fishery but if you're going all that way Ray's Camp on Ramsey lake right next to it is 1000 times better. Ramsey is at least imo worlds better than Bisco.  http://www.rayscamps.com/

773191,kuhaman,2013-03-11 18:37:00,503,"I have been fishing Bisco for over 20 years and I think it is one of the best drive to lakes in north eastern Ontario. The walleye fishing is fantastic. There is also decent pike and perch fishing. Having a lake map and a good fishfinder will make the walleye fishing pretty easy. Helps to have a boat with a good size motor to get around because the lake is big.. The road in is not that bad, about 75k's of gravel and sand. Stayed at Ritchies and they are pretty good but I prefer Biscotasing sportsmans lodge. Great people and beauty cabins. Lots of walleye right off their dock. Good luck.  Kuha"

773226,can u fish,2013-03-11 23:19:00,326,"I fished Biscotasing 4 years ago first week of june we took the train in from Sudbury and stayed at Ritchies end of trail lodge accomadations were good the american plan is different they stock your cabin with food and you do your own cooking and you have access to the food shed anytime.Now for the fishing we caught 5 walleye for the whole week and some small perch and very small pike we tried to get to the portage lake where you take your boat on a train trolley over the hill and pull it up but the trolley was off the track and at the bottom of the lake,we fished hard every day we had fish finders but no luck at all we tried worm harnesses bottom bouncers jigging and different crank baits with no success where ever we fished we were not marking many, at that time the staff was not very knowlegeble of the lake and no one ever did mention Ramsey Lake.
