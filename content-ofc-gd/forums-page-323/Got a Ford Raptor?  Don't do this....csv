765482,jedimaster,2013-02-05 19:32:00,3472,":06 - :07 the truck bed falls off mid air, something fake about that video to me."
765486,jedimaster,2013-02-05 19:46:00,3472,This is how its supposed ot be done....
765517,Fisherman,2013-02-05 21:30:00,7201,Unfortunately they get to vote and have kids that pass on recessive genes.
765571,kickingfrog,2013-02-05 23:37:00,8333,I would suspect that it was not the first jump for that truck.
765598,BillM,2013-02-06 01:00:00,17367," You think that's fake?  Come on man, lol."
765621,Pigeontroller,2013-02-06 02:00:00,2793,Dummies! Don't they know that only '69 Dodge Chargers can jump like that!
765627,jedimaster,2013-02-06 02:24:00,3472,Well real to the point where they jumped and were short and crashed yah but the dramatics of the bed falling off clearly it was already messed up.
765629,Cudz,2013-02-06 02:42:00,2652,This is my best attempt at jumping.  Pretty insignificant compared with the raptor jump.  Biggest difference is that I drove away from my jump. 
765636,BillM,2013-02-06 03:13:00,17367, I think you're seeing the bedliner coming out of the bed....
765721,jedimaster,2013-02-06 16:19:00,3472,"nope it has a tonou cover on it, the bed is clearly not attatched, look how far back it sits even before the jump, and in the slo wmotion at .25 seconds you can see it lifting off while in the air before the impact."
765729,DRIFTER_016,2013-02-06 16:43:00,10439,The comments on the video say that the guy was wrecking it on purpose so he probably removed the bed hold down bolts for effect.
766390,northernpike56,2013-02-09 00:25:00,717,what in the world
766412,BillM,2013-02-09 01:59:00,17367," Yup, I think you're right.  I watched it over and over again and finally saw it, lol!"
773053,Rod Caster,2013-03-11 00:52:00,5784,another angle  
773099,wannabefisherman,2013-03-11 06:01:00,19,"here's a different angle, you can see the impact better!  "
765163,BillM,2013-02-04 18:36:00,17367,
765167,DRIFTER_016,2013-02-04 18:47:00,10439,I saw that on Power Blocks FB feed this morning. Rednecks with money are a bad thing!!!
765169,BillM,2013-02-04 18:48:00,17367,"Dave, the airbags going off is cracking me up!!  LOL!!!"
765181,ecmilley,2013-02-04 19:19:00,2163,air bag delete before jumps all us real rednecks know that
765196,kickingfrog,2013-02-04 19:41:00,8333,"""Dude, why do you look like a racoon? And why'd you take the bus today?"""
765218,HTHM,2013-02-04 20:38:00,4082,"""Hold my beer and watch this...."""
765230,Rustic-Fisher,2013-02-04 20:58:00,826,At least he remembered to put his four way lights on after the accident LOL!!
765234,bare foot wader,2013-02-04 21:08:00,1354,I liked braking while airborn right before the landing LOL
765239,Cudz,2013-02-04 21:33:00,2652,lol.  the truth is that most cars automatically put on four ways in an accident.  If the airbag deploys a little voice comes on telling you to call 911.
765240,jedimaster,2013-02-04 21:44:00,3472,Thems be air brakes....
765243,Cudz,2013-02-04 21:50:00,2652,"Here is my buddy's raptor (the white one) and his friend (black one).  That is a combine 822hp stuck!  To be fair he says it is really good in the sand and this sand was really soft and he did not air down at all.  And by the way, He has lived in Dubai for about 12 years and yes he does know how to drive in sand. I lived there for almost 8 years and you figure it out pretty quickly.  "
765244,Cudz,2013-02-04 21:51:00,2652,I was actually really impressed at how flat the raptor was in the air.  That was a really good jump! Just a terrible landing.
765262,kickingfrog,2013-02-04 23:24:00,8333,The only airbag in that sidekick was… never mind.
765267,Rich Nelson,2013-02-04 23:35:00,332,Thats a good waste of $60 k. Lol
765269,Christopheraaron,2013-02-04 23:39:00,3525,LMAO!
765309,fishindevil,2013-02-05 01:23:00,6254,Holy crap !!!! And that's one expensive truck too .... Think the frame is a little bent ??? Haha....
765329,irishfield,2013-02-05 01:59:00,26272,"So nice of Ford to program 4 way activation... on airbag deployment! Impacts like that are why the airbag fuse is pulled in my plow truck,,, I hate the taste of C4 !"
765331,Freshtrax,2013-02-05 02:06:00,2215,If I win the lottery.....why not....
765343,kemper,2013-02-05 03:07:00,2232,Just watched that again...I wonder if  they managed to escape without serious injury? That is a huge impact.
765349,Rod Caster,2013-02-05 03:16:00,5784,"My mazda would of strolled away with nothing but a few dusty spots...   Christ, that's one heck of an impact. I wouldn't expect otherwise given the size of that jump and the angle of departure."
765352,Muskieman,2013-02-05 03:24:00,2472,"The SVT Raptor was designed by Ford to leave the ground , just not to that extreme ..  That hurt more than his truck and wallet  I'm sure .. OUCH !"
765353,kickingfrog,2013-02-05 03:25:00,8333,"Black eyes, broken nose and a mess in his drawers."
765354,kickingfrog,2013-02-05 03:27:00,8333,Leaving the ground is no big deal… it's the coming back down that weighs on a truck and the driver.
765383,ckrb2007,2013-02-05 10:29:00,449,ouch...how's your spine!! lol Guess they forgot to maximize the Fox shocks on that one. lol
765413,TJQ,2013-02-05 14:47:00,7806,  LOL>. that was awesome... and yes those are likey to be my last words.....
