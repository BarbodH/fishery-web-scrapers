772817,Leecher,2013-03-09 22:20:00,7832, Sounds like a great idea Wayne but I think this auger as expired it's use and next year will be looking for a better component build... I hate plastic parts they put on some of the stuff they put on the shelves... I think this one was a mishap on my part    I'll look very closely on my next purchase from now on
772857,Rod Caster,2013-03-10 01:08:00,5784,"Get an old 6"" finbore off kijiji and I'll send you a set of new blades! My friend got an old unit for $10 and it cuts like butter with the new blades!"
772875,Whitespinnerbait,2013-03-10 02:13:00,2038,You should have had a better '' GRIP '' on things.    
772893,Leecher,2013-03-10 03:11:00,7832," I'll keep that in mind, thanks Chad!!!    Yep... that grip above would of definitely help!  Nice shots Paul"
772906,Muskieman,2013-03-10 03:53:00,2472,"Ah here's a little mix of the words that probably came out , Saintsacratabarnamerdostidphocalwiss de chienne sale !  * longest word in the Franco Canadian language  and then all the birds flew away."
772937,Leecher,2013-03-10 13:35:00,7832, Yeah that about sums it up Randy
772943,Christopheraaron,2013-03-10 13:52:00,3525,"Definitely look at the finbores, they are amazing! My only complaint would be not enough flutes to help lift slush out of the hole, but other than that it's amazing!"
772961,gino,2013-03-10 16:50:00,400,"aaahhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!   Jacque, almost happent to me yesterday...mine is the cheapest one from BPS...10 inches of slush under 3 inches of frozen snow, all on top of onother 12 inces of black ice...i left my gas auger at home thinking the manual one will be enough, big mistake...sweat like a pig drilling 3 holes..  :wallbash:"
772983,Leecher,2013-03-10 18:35:00,7832," Thanks Christopher!!!  Will definitely look those up for sure   Gino, you were  lucky to be able to drill 3 holes... I was drilling thru 24""+ of ice yesterday and when I got thru, guess the flemsy piece of aluminium that holds the 6"" bit let go and was left with the upper part when I pull it out    This at 7h30am  it happen.... left 2 hours later since they were not biting"
772987,misfish,2013-03-10 19:01:00,29133," Thats why I never leave my spud behind. 24"" ppppfffffffffff"
772988,Leecher,2013-03-10 19:37:00,7832,  Yeah B... Wish I had a backup plan   Ice is thick this year with multi layers of black and white    Nothing like last year
772994,DRIFTER_016,2013-03-10 19:58:00,10439,"   24"" is what we have before Christmas. We're @ about 4 feet now. If you want to be drillin' thickish ice by hand get yourself a Nils!!!! Otherwise bust out your wallet and buy one with a motor on top!!!!"
772995,misfish,2013-03-10 20:11:00,29133," I got all day,,pretty much what it would take to do 4 ft."
773005,Leecher,2013-03-10 21:13:00,7832," Oh you're some funny dude Dave    4' is a lot of ice    Over here, haven't seen the ice any thicker in the last 3 - 4 years.  That's what happens when a lot of snow falls over the winter"
773007,Marko,2013-03-10 21:15:00,854,"Hey Jacques, life is too short to buy s**t made in China Sucks you have to get a new one now"
773009,Leecher,2013-03-10 21:24:00,7832, HA!  yeah that mother s**** made in china is a P**** of ***    Oh well... so be it    if you can read between the lines
773018,DRIFTER_016,2013-03-10 21:47:00,10439,"As I said Jaques, if you want to hand drill buy one of these. Yes they're expensive but they are the best hand auger made. A little tough to find this late in the season but something to think about for next season.  http://www.cabelas.com/catalog/product.jsp?productId=1089564"
773029,Leecher,2013-03-10 22:26:00,7832, Thanks Dave!!!  Will keep that in mind  I'm done this season and will be hunting down for a new one next season for sure
773130,Headhunter,2013-03-11 13:24:00,5703,"Well, I looked at the pics and I don't see Terry anywhere...so moving on, nothing to see here! HH"
773151,Leecher,2013-03-11 15:40:00,7832, LOL HH LOL   True and I agree with you Sin
772770,Leecher,2013-03-09 18:41:00,7832,This morning      TJunkie
772774,Christopheraaron,2013-03-09 18:57:00,3525,No fish!
772775,Rich Clemens,2013-03-09 18:58:00,3131,Your hole is too small
772776,Fisherman,2013-03-09 19:05:00,7201,I don't think augers make good bottom structure.
772777,GbayGiant,2013-03-09 19:12:00,1780,You forgot to bring your friend along who has the real equipment?!  
772781,spincast,2013-03-09 19:31:00,3279,no ping pong sound track?
772782,misfish,2013-03-09 19:41:00,29133, Thank gawd  Looks like a clean break to me.
772783,ChrisK,2013-03-09 19:47:00,2772,Forgot the other half of your auger at home. No you didn't !!!
772784,DRIFTER_016,2013-03-09 19:57:00,10439,It's missing some of this!!!!  
772786,kickingfrog,2013-03-09 20:39:00,8333,There is no 2stroke on your broken auger?
772789,Leecher,2013-03-09 20:50:00,7832, Good observation Christopher!  3 for 3 this season but that's not it   Nope... guess again Rich...   You're close and I totally agree with you... they do not   Nope... guess again GbayGiant   Nope... I could always make one but not this time Rick   It sure does B   Nope I did not ChrisK   Nope didn't even force it Dave   True but it's a manual one Rob
772790,misfish,2013-03-09 21:00:00,29133,"Like I said,clean break at the weld. The collar and bolt/nut,is still there."
772792,Leecher,2013-03-09 21:09:00,7832," Yep, you are correct B... it let go after I had drill my first hole    Cheap Walmart product   The drill bit went down into the abyss   Leaving me with only one hole   I think all of the wild life in the bush heard the terrible words that came out of my mouth    You won't believe how many came out"
772794,kickingfrog,2013-03-09 21:14:00,8333,"Ouch, only 1 out of a possible 6 really hurts."
772796,Leecher,2013-03-09 21:20:00,7832," Yes Rob, 1 out of 5 but still... Tried every Gulp product I had and even salties, changing every 20 min or so and not even a sniff   These pokadots this year are a hard bite"
772797,Christopheraaron,2013-03-09 21:20:00,3525,That's why I carry my axe with me when I'm out
772798,davey buoy,2013-03-09 21:22:00,5505,"Can you weld it back together?,or not worth it? I would"
772800,chris.brock,2013-03-09 21:23:00,4053,"I can see something missing too, one of your cool tip-ups"
772801,Leecher,2013-03-09 21:25:00,7832," Yeah Christopher... wish I had backup this morning!   Davey, I could if I had the other piece... it went down to the bottom"
772802,Leecher,2013-03-09 21:29:00,7832, True Chris... but those are for special members here
772803,misfish,2013-03-09 21:31:00,29133," Oh I bet I can, but Im sure I would only know a few. It,s a lingo thing.  Poor critters probly wondered what you were saying as well.  I had a few today missing my only steel hit this morning."
772806,davey buoy,2013-03-09 21:44:00,5505,"Son of a gun!!!,my bad lol. Long day on the lake today."
772809,Leecher,2013-03-09 21:47:00,7832,  If there's one song that could explain to me how this happen at the time... this would be the one    Which I'm listening right now    I love Disturbed
772811,Leecher,2013-03-09 21:47:00,7832, No worries Davey lol
772814,irishfield,2013-03-09 22:12:00,26272,"Hole will still be there tomorrow Jacque.... grab a big magnet and get the important part back, but take another auger to make the outing worth while!"
