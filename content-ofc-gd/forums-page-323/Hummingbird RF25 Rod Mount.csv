772696,SirWhite,2013-03-09 02:56:00,210,I've heard good things about the Smartcast series. But mostly from Kayakers and Canoers' with limited alternatives. Looks like it would be tough to view and jig at the same time   Edit* I did see a wrist watch type one for sale on Kajiji in Sudbury

773722,Canitalian,2013-03-14 15:58:00,75,Any reason why? I was leaning towards the rob mount. Figure it's easier to follow
