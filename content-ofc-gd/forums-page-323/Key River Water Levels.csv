773158,brw,2013-03-11 16:27:00,101,Friends: Planning a trip to NE corner of Geo Bay this June and heard that we may not even be able to get up/through The Key River due to ever lowering water levels. If true this is alarming since as far as I can remember we've always been able to navigate the Key.  Any insight or scuttlebutt much appreciated.  Cheers.

Went down the Key two summers ago to look at an island cottage for sale in the delta area and it was fine.  Tons of rocks lurking under the surface though, you do have to be careful."

Water levels are back to 1964's lowest level and many that bought ""waterfront"" through the 80's and 90's, when the bay was about 1.5Metres higher, have found themselves with nothing but a mud hole where their dock should go!

773174,irishfield,2013-03-11 17:20:00,26272,"Musky fishing with Andy this fall.... 2 weeks apart... water had dropped almost a foot and a half and it wasn't just the ""tide"" going out for a change. I'm trying to find a picture of picnic island in HHarbour I received a few weeks ago.. it'll scare ya!"

773183,moxie,2013-03-11 17:58:00,1566,WOW!!!! Difficult to look at considering how much fresh water surrounds us. Global warming/Climate change ? I doubt it. Me thinks someones got some Splainin' to doo.
773186,fishindevil,2013-03-11 18:14:00,6254,"we just snowmobiled over the key river a few weeks ago and you could see the water level marks,and it was super low !!!! unreal....."
