773205,Headhunter,2013-03-11 20:54:00,5703,"This is ""Bucky""... he's a rescue dog we got back in May of last year. He came to us as ""Lucky"", but that name didn't jive with me too well. After getting to know him, we changed it to Bucky and he has been fine with it. Apparently Bucky had spent the first four years of his life in a down town condo, so moving in with us when his owner took ill has been a real learning curve for Bucky. I think I had to teach him that he can swim this summer at the cottage. He ""fell"" out of the boat a few yards from shore, sank, then bobbed up like a cork. After that,he was a wet smelly dog for the rest of the week.  Funny, he won't go in the pool, thankfully.  He been an awesome family pet. HH"
