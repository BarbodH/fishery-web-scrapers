Hope to see everyone there. Thanks chris."
773184,Snidley,2013-03-11 18:08:00,620,"I will be there with over 100 premium Japanese fishing lures(almost all new or new in box) from Jackal, Lucky Craft, Evergreen, OSP, MegaBass, and Yozuri. I understand that there's so many private sellers and actual vendors that the event has expanded to 2 rooms from last years one room. I really enjoyed it last year and I found some great deals at other tables when I got a chance to look around. Also got to meet BigUgli's dog which was great too."

773228,Christopheraaron,2013-03-11 23:35:00,3525,"Hey B, I won't have many trout flies since I don't think I'll be getting a very big trout fly fishing crowd, but if you have some in particular in mind let me know and they'll be waiting for you"
