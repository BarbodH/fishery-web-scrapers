773525,BillM,2013-03-13 14:31:00,17367,At least we know where all the stocking efforts on the Saugeen will end up!    Fantastic eh?
773539,Reelaction,2013-03-13 15:00:00,33,More trouble for an already troubled fishery.
773544,kemper,2013-03-13 15:14:00,2232,"Great - just what that fishery needed.  Things like this continue to boggle my mind.  Oh but don't worry, its OK:  ""In March, April, October and November, “commercial fishers will make best efforts” not to set commercial nets within a one-kilometre radius of the mouths of Bothwell Creek, Colpoys Creek, Waterton Creek, Keefers Creek and Gleason Brook, to protect spawning salmon and rainbow trout.""  Two problems here.  1. ""Best Efforts"" - are you kidding me? We have technology for that. 2. You'll notice February is missing from that 1 km protection. Expect to see nets strung across the mouth of all these creeks.  I bet the people that have been pouring their heart and soul (and cash) into stocking efforts are jumping for joy on this one."
773547,kemper,2013-03-13 15:21:00,2232,"I guess it's important to note that with the harvest rates in the recreational fishery in that area, its probably 6 one and half dozen the other.  Keep up crap like this and we're going to have to go the US route and just dump 10 billion stockies in every year. Oh wait, we can't afford that.  Humans - raping and pillaging natural resources since the beginning of time"
773548,mr blizzard,2013-03-13 15:23:00,1589,"I saw the exact same thing first hand for 2 years on Vancouver Island.  And on the docks the fisheries officers just watched. I am biting my tongue and will shut up as I really appreciate this board and being a member, but my son and I will continue to scoop up others garbage while on a lake."
773550,bare foot wader,2013-03-13 15:33:00,1354,"ah, yes, Van island, nothing like driving through Port Alberni and finding the dumpsters full of sockeye...glad somebody is supporting their family but i'll never buy candied salmon from a roadside stand again  the MNR is in a tough spot, they need to find compromise, it seems to teeter totter from one side to the other without ever balancing...colpoys bay is a special spot for me, we never left the cottage out of sight and always managed a couple of rainbows or a chinook for the bbq with very little effort, it would be sad to see that change  "
773557,4x4bassin,2013-03-13 15:59:00,1025,"I was going to stay out of this one and keep my comments to myself but just couldn't resist . I have been fishing that part of G Bay for nearly 40 years and have seen it go from some world class trout waters to well below average and kinda back up again and hearing this news is really frustrating to me . We should be trying to help this troubled fishery and with this new agreement it sure is not the case I agree the MNR is in a real bind hear but there has to be a way for everyone to respect that area and come up with some real world solutions , if not the fish stocks will crash like we have not seen before !"
773568,mike rousseau,2013-03-13 17:16:00,4661,I somewhat understand not taking away natural resource rights given... I don't agree... But I understand....  But giving more rights... Thats ludacris...  It's seams that the majority spends years to take 1 step foreword... Then the minority takes everyone 2 steps back in an instant...  Just glad my First Nations friends don't abuse the rights given to them... They follow the same rules I do out of respect for the fishery...
773591,fishnsled,2013-03-13 19:35:00,3520,"Between this and the Nipissing agreement, I'm having very little faith in the powers that make these decisions for any future for our fisheries."
773599,fishindevil,2013-03-13 20:25:00,6254,yup just another act of stupidity on behalf of the powers that be !!!! another fishery is doomed what a joke....
