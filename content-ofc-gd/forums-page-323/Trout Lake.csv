Has anyone ever fished there? I have tried to Google it and other resources, with not much success. So if anyone has any info it would be appreciated.  Thanks."
773608,Acountdeleted,2013-03-13 21:23:00,2562,Welcome to the site.  Just did a quick search on Fish-online. Looks like quite the deep lake and tons of fish species diversity. Looks like a great lake to fish for a few weeks to discover. I know it won't really tell you about what the dominant species is or what the fish bite off of but Fish-OnLine is really an amazing resource. If you get a second check it out.  Best of luck.

If i could ever retire somewhere it would be in this area!"
