773460,Christopheraaron,2013-03-13 01:38:00,3525,"The show you're thinking of is the Hamilton tackle swap, I'll be there selling bass and pike flies, musky lures and a few fly rods, there might be some others selling fly fishing stuff too."
773775,PAZE,2013-03-15 00:19:00,132,When is it and where?
773777,bigugli,2013-03-15 00:42:00,6138,My understanding was that an HAFFT event was to be held March 30th and Apr 1st in Hamilton. Best thing would be to contact that club.
773812,cuzza,2013-03-15 11:32:00,467,"While i can't claim to be the voice of HAFFT, I am a member and we don't have anything on that weekend (unless it's being kept very quiet! )  Last year the Izaak Walton Fly Forum was at the Hamilton Convention Centre, this year, it was combined with the Sportsman's Show in Toronto. The New Fly Fisher Symposium was supposed to be next weekend but that has been moved to November and it's in Mississauga http://www.thenewflyfisher.com/fly-fishing-symposium.php"
773824,bigugli,2013-03-15 14:13:00,6138,"There were a number of people still thinking it was on for next week, talking about it at the Ft Erie show. I heard about it through a fly tyer who was quite excited about the event. Boy is he gonna be disappointed."
773906,PAZE,2013-03-15 22:51:00,132,So other then the sportsman show there is no fly fishing show anywhere in Ontario this spring? that's to bad was looking forward to some type of swing show.
773920,Christopheraaron,2013-03-16 00:42:00,3525,"Well there was the symposium last week, and like I said there will be at least one booth at the hamilton tackle swap"
