Well, haven't been out much this season compared to previous years... 3 times total   Not normal for me  First 2 outings, came back with white stripes for my efforts but yesterday was determine to put an end to my negative streek... what I didn't know was how the day was going to unfold  So I'm up bright and early, 5h30am, on the road by 6h00am and got to destination 7h30am... It was beautiful out there with sunny skies and no wind   -10C at the time and getting warmer  Started to scout the area where I usually setup as I'm walking onto the ice... a few holes here & there but none where I usually setpup... so I started to drill my hole... about 4"" of snow was on top of the ice... got busy drilling and  about 40 - 45 sec into it, I get thru    I give another 1/2 turn and push down to brake the little bit left and then proceed to pull on the handle... huh    tough... pull again and WAMMO!!!  Left with handle in hand    At this point could not believe it    and then came the fancy words that cannot be displayed here... but it was a great mix  So now, I'm faced with an unusable auger, and not sure if I can drop a line in that hole     I started to remove the slush from it to get a better picture, get my jigging rod out, drop a buckshot as a last resort and hope for the best    Well it turns out, the spoon goes down to bottom and started to jigging   But it wasn't working  So then, decided to change presentation every 15 minutes or so to see if I could get a hookup.... NOT  Things I tried from the arsenal I had was:  1/4oz Buckshot, 1/4oz jig with grub tipped with minnow head, dead sticking salties, micro jig with Gulp fish fry,  Micro tube on a tiny jig with Gulp grub (twister tail), salties again on a spoon,  half a salties (head) on a hook.... NOTHING WOULD WORK  So by 10h30am, I called it a day out of frustation and some very unpleasant choice of words  So I made this little video of my ordeal... choice of music is a little iffy but hope it's OK by the mods  Enjoy!

773111,Fish Farmer,2013-03-11 11:24:00,2234,"Gezz Jacques, I'd save the handle and go back and get it with a magnet. You think you can get in in the spring if you can mark that spot."
773150,Leecher,2013-03-11 15:35:00,7832,"Dave, it's beyond repair   I know exactly where it is...  and would be able to retrieve it at ice out but the drill bit broke at the collar that is still attach to the handle   Next season will be looking at purchasing a new one"
773169,mr blizzard,2013-03-11 17:01:00,1589,"And I thought my ice fishing season sucked LOL<br /><br />Thanks again for the recipe , I guess we are both substituting ribs in place of fish fries.<br /><br />I know your next hard water season will be 1,000% better Jacque.<br /><br />Cheers John"
773222,Leecher,2013-03-11 22:16:00,7832,"Your welcome John... my pleasure to share    I still got venison in the freezer and was hoping to do a surf & turf... had I caught one of them pokadots     Ah well, need to wait until end of April now and it's all good  I'll settle on them ribs and chicken fried rice for the time being  Jacques"
773236,dhickey,2013-03-12 00:14:00,1038,Tj you crack me up..  If your intrested in a real auger with a engine let ne know.  I of corse would have to deliver it but shipping cost can be off set with FISHING...
773258,Mike the Pike,2013-03-12 02:11:00,3421,Jacques you are just too strong for a manual auger get a gas Auger!
773267,Leecher,2013-03-12 02:40:00,7832," That sounds like a great idea SaltyD!!! I'll keep that in mind   Mike, I like to travel light and a manual auger is perfect for me... Just have to buy a better build one next time"
