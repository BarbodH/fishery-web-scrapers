772024,Moosebunk,2013-03-06 01:35:00,3970,"Early last week did two days of laker chasing.  Felt like 200 holes got drilled but probably only 50 to 60.  Did huff and did puff... ti'll I blew this fat greasers hole in.    Midweek storm came that didn't slow my buddy Keith.  First hole and within seconds on the drop... he surely huffed, and must have puffed, but a giant splaker totally blew his hole in.      Been four years since fishing a day for just ice pike.  Sunday jiggin' a spoon tipped with minnow head, Snarlin' Darlin' here huffed, puffed and she got kinda rough, ti'll it blew the hole in.  Still got it.    Last week had fishin' been made of straw, sticks or bricks, it wouldn't have mattered.  We blew da house down!  "
