Service was good as ususal. Pretty much non-stop action all day but we only kept 5 fish out of 100 ++ caught.  2 were 11-12 inches. 2 herring caught.  Marked fish all day on the flasher. There was 20 + inches of ice where I cut holes outside.  This was my 4th trip this winter in the Beaveron-Pefferlaw area from early January to yesterday -3 with operators and 1 walking out.  Result was the same each trip, lot's of small perch and very few keepers. I prefer this area because traditionally less numbers but bigger fish compared to Cooks Bay. I know there is a seasonal movement of perch moving to spawning grounds nearer spring and that perch group up in the same year class and size.  Any one else seeing a drop in the perch size in this area- on average over a few trips?"

I'm gonna giver a try again mid week and see if my theory is right. The bigs ones are there,  they just won't bite.  S."

Average perch sized seemed smaller than in years past, with only a few jumbos in the mix.  Still a far better average size than I usually find on Cook's Bay.  And yup, a few nice herring were caught and released.  Their numbers sure seem to be increasing nicely."
