Jigging the DNL clown colored jigging spoon yesterday evening, it didn't really even take that long and I was into what I wanted all ice season. This is a cell shot and the fish was released, but make no mistake it was a huge crappie! A lot of bending and flexing on the tape put it at 17"" but I'm happy with an 'official' measurement of 16.5""  Awesome. I have never had a crappie fight like this. I thought for sure I had a 25"" pike on the line.  "

772533,Nipfisher,2013-03-08 13:39:00,2449,Awesome Rich. A couple of small perch for me on the orange / white jig from DNL.
772541,The Urban Fisherman,2013-03-08 13:58:00,2050,Nice work buddy!
772549,Rich,2013-03-08 14:57:00,3927,"Lol, I always see those pics and assume they just stuck the lure in there after catching it on something else. This fish inhaled the spoon, so the lure shot would have been somewhat gruesome, lmao  Thanks everyone!"
772551,TJQ,2013-03-08 15:00:00,7806,LOL...  Thanks RICH!!
772555,kemper,2013-03-08 15:07:00,2232,"That's a big crappie...quick TJ sponsor that man before someone else gets him!  I've been unable to catch a crappie all season, maybe I should browse on over to the site..."
773110,aplumma,2013-03-11 11:03:00,6896,excellent fish that for sure was worth catching.  Art
