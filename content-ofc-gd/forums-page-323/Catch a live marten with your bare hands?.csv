773094,Old Ironmaker,2013-03-11 05:01:00,8243,"That's one brave footballer, or stupid or both. I thought it was illegal in soccer to use your hands? And of course they used that magic spray they use in soccer to spray on the bite. Why don't they use that here for football or hockey? Heck no one would need to go to the locker room. A soccer guy is being given his last rites by a Priest because he is rolling around on the ground like some one shot him with a 3030 and they spray that magic spray on and he's back up and playing in seconds. Gotta love that magic spray."
