773474,chessy,2013-03-13 03:28:00,610,"The mnr has lost the battle with enforcement They have left the waters to every person who does not care about the fishery and when you call and complain you are told ""why do you care"" or it is ""none of your business""  I have not seen a warden on the river system I fish at all. The blatant disregards for the law would fill a ticket book in one day and help pay for the officers pay . any one else seeing this or is it only on the river i fish"
773477,BillM,2013-03-13 03:33:00,17367,Were out in full force on Simcoe this year.

773479,kemper,2013-03-13 03:38:00,2232,In the past 8 years on the river 2-3 times per week all spring and fall I have been checked for a license ONE time.
773480,chessy,2013-03-13 03:38:00,610,so the meeting i was at when they said they only care about the walleye fishery could be very well true. and that came straight from a DFO representative
773485,camillj,2013-03-13 04:24:00,1988,"I fish in Muskoka (hardwater) and have been checked almost 50% of the time I have been out there .. maybe I am just on the 'route' but I am not seeing this .... having said that, my favourite eastern trib which I have fished for over 40 years ... never once seen em ... but trust me we 'the people' do our own policing ... and more than a few would-be offenders have wandered sheepishly away seeing me saunter in their direction with my brushcut and green cap  "
773491,Old Ironmaker,2013-03-13 05:28:00,8243,"I must say they are few and far between out here on eastern basin of Erie, I agree there. Saw 3 youngsters on a brand spankin new vessel sporting twin 200 Mercs 2 years ago at the Hydro station at Nanticoke. prior to that was exactly the same spot in 1990. That's it around here. Some of the things you quote them as saying I find hard to believe, have always found them to be professional, respectful and have had occasion to speak to them on the phone reporting ridiculous actions of a few nimnods and have always been taken seriously without attitude. As I said if what you report is accurate those statements by a Ministry of Natural Resources employee would be considered to be worthy of disciplinary action. I don't know what a DFO rep is. Another reason I'm not a fan of acronyms."
773505,esoxansteel,2013-03-13 12:57:00,1307,"Theres never been any enforcement on the Ganny, which im assuming your refering to Chessy, unfortunately we have had 2 Kens's in the past 30 years, Ken number one before he retired was more concerned with the smaller more vulnerable tribs which was fine and he had a point, as the rivers at that time 80s were loaded with steelhead, Ken number two is non-existent, and is rarer then 2 suns in the sunset, just wait till we receive Ken number 3, if you think its bad now."
773509,chessy,2013-03-13 13:31:00,610,dFO.  Department of fisheries and oceans . Yes live release it's the ganny but also coboug and bowmanvile creeks
773511,kemper,2013-03-13 13:42:00,2232,"There has to be something we can do as anglers, to bring awareness and maybe a few bucks to this issue.  Might serve us better than just beaching about it on here all the time?"
773517,chessy,2013-03-13 13:59:00,610,"Kemper believe me I just don't whine here lol  I would love to see the stats on tips call ins  how many for walley and how many for trout and see what is respons time .  I know for a fact I called and got all the info of over limit fish for salmon this guy was acting fish every day and one day kept over his limit I called and co called me back 5 days later I still had all his info and pictures as well was told by co  the guy is from Kingston and it is not worth my time to presume the charge . I said ok but this guy is killing at least 5 fish aday just have a local co stop by  ""nope "" we are to busy .    So I posted the guys picture on line . Hopefully some one would recognize him and embarrasse him some more"
773533,BucktownAngler,2013-03-13 14:52:00,582,"ive called before to report littering in and around the water, and wasting of caught fish.  i guess an MNR officer wasnt available, because a police officer showed up who didnt even get out of the car. i explained what happened to him, he did nothing.  half the people scattered though when he pulled up, fishing without a license i assume"
773535,kemper,2013-03-13 14:55:00,2232," I guess I meant on a higher level Chessy. I tend to ridicule folks who are breaking the rules too...some leave sheepishly and some get confrontational, and I've never met a trout that's worth a fist fight."
773536,Rich,2013-03-13 14:55:00,3927,I've been checked twice this year.. just sayin
