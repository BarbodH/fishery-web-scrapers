773279,BillM,2013-03-12 03:09:00,17367," I hope you didn't pay much.  but yeah, that's a bit shady if you ask me..."
773280,paul_614,2013-03-12 03:16:00,168,"the money was not the issue, this time it was more about being able to cross right away. A handfull of yes and no questions and good to go. The part that bothers me with the d/l is that there is no kind of background check ( not that I need it )"
773282,kickingfrog,2013-03-12 03:23:00,8333,My understanding of the guarantor under the new rules is that if it is your first passport application the photo does still have to be signed by a professional but if you are renewing then the above standards apply.
773284,paul_614,2013-03-12 03:27:00,168,That could be why I had to pay
773286,BillM,2013-03-12 03:38:00,17367," Doesn't matter if it's a new passport or a renewal, guarantor requirements are the same."
773287,paul_614,2013-03-12 03:39:00,168, even 10 years ago?
773289,BillM,2013-03-12 03:41:00,17367," 10 years ago there were different rules, you needed a professional (cop, lawyer, doctor, etc)"
773307,pikehunter,2013-03-12 10:19:00,1659,"FOR GOD'S SAKE MAN! jUST GO TO THE GOVERNMENTS WEBSITE AND PRINT OFF THE APP! Get the requirements right from the horses mouth! Why even ask on here and listen to a bunch of heresay?  ......with that said my wife, my son and I all got first time passports several years ago, and NO need for a doctor or a notary public to sign! Just signatures from those who have had one for five years and not a relative.  But just check it out here http://www.ppt.gc.ca/index.aspx for the current facts and requirements.  Best of luck on your international travels."
773455,hotsky,2013-03-13 01:20:00,400,"I got my passport almost 5 years ago, I know that because I just went to the States and noticed that it expires in June. Will renew for sure esp if it will be good for 10 years. It was fast and easy and I dont know why someone wouldn't want to have one."
773470,Old Ironmaker,2013-03-13 02:42:00,8243,"Get a passport, an enhanced drivers license may work but it won't get you into Cuba or anywhere else where you need a passport which is everywhere post 9 11.  No one can charge you to sign your passport application, I have never heard of such a thing, even at my Dr's where they want to charge you for everything, don't get me going on that. They can simply refuse.  If one has had a current passport for so many years and will attest that they have known you for a period of time, can't remember exactly how long, that person can sigh the app. It's clearly explained on the application. Get a passport."
773473,BillM,2013-03-13 03:28:00,17367," As of now, renewals are still 5years.   Will be nice when they're 10."
773507,kickingfrog,2013-03-13 13:21:00,8333,"Not having to renew as often will be nice, but it will cost more of course, despite the fact that their processing costs will be less.."
773520,woodenboater,2013-03-13 14:13:00,2277,poking around Pikehunter's link and found July 2013 is the magical date for 10 year passports.  http://www.ppt.gc.ca/eppt/about.aspx?lang=eng
773165,ecmilley,2013-03-11 16:53:00,2163,"Not sure have been told i need a passport or a new drivers license, if time allows want to go to lake champlain this year for pre-spawn buckets"
773166,irishfield,2013-03-11 16:54:00,26272,Yes... you can't cross without a passport or enhansed drivers licence Ernie
773167,BillM,2013-03-11 16:55:00,17367,"Get a passport, simple enough."
773176,paul_614,2013-03-11 17:28:00,168,enhanced licence is easier than a passport to get
773179,Angler management,2013-03-11 17:37:00,280,They dont have to accept enhanced license... Might still ask for passport! I wouldnt gamble it. Get the passport
773181,BillM,2013-03-11 17:39:00,17367," Have you seen what's required to get an Enhanced Drivers License?  1 form, 2 pics and $80 gets you a passport.  It doesn't get much easier then that."
773193,Bill Shearer,2013-03-11 19:08:00,456,"Passport can get to your door in 10 days, once you have filled out the paperwork. thats all it took for mine."
773195,bare foot wader,2013-03-11 19:32:00,1354,"I think the standard processing time is 28 days, depending on volume...but you can pay $30 for priority service and then it's guaranteed in 7 days i think...i might be off on the timeline but it's something like that...I got mine back in less than a week"
773200,10point,2013-03-11 20:45:00,165,"Heck, last year my friend got back into the US without a passport of any kind. He left it at the fishing camp! Good thing they let him in becuase I was leaving his butt there if they didn't."
773204,ecmilley,2013-03-11 20:52:00,2163,"passports it is then, thanks guys never know who to believe, since i got champlain on hot maps it's a good enough excuse to go"
773207,Roy,2013-03-11 21:02:00,13728,Go to a Service Canada office in your area. They'll fix you up...shouldn't be more than 10 days total turn around.
773224,BillM,2013-03-11 22:33:00,17367,"Should also be able to pick up the passport application at the post office.   Fill that out, get your picture taken at Costco and you're golden!"
773229,John,2013-03-11 23:44:00,2956,"What Roy said.Do NOT rely on enhanced D/L, ..."
773230,paul_614,2013-03-11 23:47:00,168,"I have one, answered 10 questions maybe, had the girl at the counter ask me  the same questions to see if I answered them the same way. Headed over the bridge 10 minutes later. I don't plan on flying, so no passport. I also didn't want to pay for someone to sign it to say that I am who I say I am."
773231,paul_614,2013-03-11 23:50:00,168,"We travell over once a week and never had an issue. If the rainbow bridge is busy, they open up the nexus lane to enhanced drivers"
773241,whiskywizard,2013-03-12 00:43:00,305,"There are a few good reasons to avoid the enhanced licence. You can get into trouble if you wind up in the US by accident, such as when a plane gets diverted. If everything goes perfectly, it's fine.  In July, the Canadian passport goes from a 5-year renewal to 10.  BTW, we have NEXUS cards. If you cross more than a few times a year, it's fantastic. You can even use your NEXUS when returning to Canada from anywhere other than the US too."
773259,danc,2013-03-12 02:11:00,4677,Enhanced DL for me. Couple of simple questions and I think $15.00 more than a regular DL. Been across the border dozens of times with it.
773266,John Bacon,2013-03-12 02:36:00,3277, Isn't illegal to charge someone for signing their passport pictures?  I know it used to be.  You no longer require a professional designation to be allowed to sign passport photo's.  I think anyone who has a passport or has one for a 5 years can sign passport photo's.  It should be too difficult to get them signed.
773269,paul_614,2013-03-12 02:51:00,168,a noter republic or dr has to sign your application
773271,danc,2013-03-12 02:52:00,4677,Nope. Anyone else with a passport can.
773272,BillM,2013-03-12 02:54:00,17367," No they don't..   Your guarantor must: In the case of a child, the guarantor must have known you (the parent or legal guardian who is applying on behalf of the child) personally for at least two (2) years and must have knowledge of the child;"
773273,paul_614,2013-03-12 02:56:00,168,"In the case of a child, the guarantor must have known you (the parent or legal guardian who is applying on behalf of the child) personally for at least two (2) years and must have knowledge of the child; my first passport app had to be signed and I chose my dr and had to pay"
773275,BillM,2013-03-12 03:00:00,17367," I've never had to pay anyone, even when your guarantor had to be a professional."
773276,woodenboater,2013-03-12 03:01:00,2277,"before applying for a passport, check to see when the new rules take effect re: time before passport expiration. Previously passports were good for 5 years I believe but you will soon be able to get them for 10 years. Not sure when this takes effect but would be worth looking into.  fwiw, last time I was at a land border crossing (several years ago at least, Fort Erie) I asked the US border agent about using an expired passport for land crossings and he said that was fine. I never felt right about that so always keep a current passport on me at all times.  imo, passport > drivers license"
773277,paul_614,2013-03-12 03:04:00,168,then I guess I got screwed
