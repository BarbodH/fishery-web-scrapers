773148,cityfisher,2013-03-11 15:07:00,959,went last year for a weekend.. spoke to 5 groups... one guy out of them all caught a 3lb..it was slow...  I caught my first Whtiie AWAY from Lake Simcoe on bernhard..but that was the only fish for 4 guys for the weekend:(
773349,reelinrolly,2013-03-12 17:22:00,281,Lake Bernard can be hit or miss.  The locals are generally on the fish but don't be afraid to stry from the shanty towns.  Whitefish. Try two way minnow spreader just of bottom. Or meegs/ bad boy tipped with a chartreuse tube  Lakers.  Try Williams spoons. White tubes and large shiners on a tip up  Ling. dead minnows right on bottom.  Or glow in the dark jig tipped with minnow. Ling fishing is more productive at night. They should be starting to spawn shortly so it should be fairly productive.  Hope this helps  Be sure to talk to the local tackle shop They can point you in the right direction
