We were a little disappointed when we got there. Overflowing garbage   from previous occupants was still in the huts. The taxi equipment was in rough shape (thought we might have to push the argo home  ) . Hut heater worked great,but the only way to vent the shack was to leave the door open. I realize the owner has only had the business 2 years, but equipment needs to be maintained. As for the fishing, the huts were in 25-30 FOW off Pt Bolster, and the bite was slow and soft. The group of us probably caught, in total, 100 perch, all dinks. There were a couple herring to give excitement . I even ""found"" one of them ellusive whitefish everyone was talking about. Shook him off at the hole to watch him slowly sink and chum the waters.  All the same. it was a beautiful bluebird day. I had good company, and we caught fish. and I am grateful for getting an opportunity to finally get up to Simcoe this ice season."

773872,misfish,2013-03-15 20:11:00,29133, Not for awhile from what I seen this afternoon.   Thats just uncalled for. Not sure I would of paid for that trip out Bruce.
773876,mr blizzard,2013-03-15 20:18:00,1589,"Glad you had a great day out, but I agree with Misfish, it would be nice if the operator gave u some compensation considering the condition of the hut."
773878,fishnsled,2013-03-15 20:22:00,3520,"Sounds like a fun day on the ice with a bit of entertainment as well.  Too bad of the the conditions of the hut and the not so great transportation.  I know that being the end of the season the last thing he probably wants to do is service the equipment.  However, it's apart of providing a quality day for your clients and their likely return or word of mouth advertising.  As for the garbage, that's just being lazy.  Takes a minute or 2 to clean up when bringing everyone in at the end of the day.  For that matter, leave a garbage bag in the hut for your clients to use.  All of that aside, a great day on the ice with good company and some fish to boot.  How was the ice?  I'm guessing pretty much glare with no snow?  I'll be out there tomorrow but haven't decide on the location as of yet."
773884,bigugli,2013-03-15 20:54:00,6138,"4"" of white with 8"" of black, and some water pockets.   Shore ice is getting a little iffy. One skidoo went through at shore and was being towed out.  The garbage can was overflowing with trash and TP. I don't think the new owners have a clue.  I've noticed on more than one occassion, that immigrant buyers see the financial potential of the resort industry, but really have no idea on how to operate a recreational business."
773886,bigugli,2013-03-15 20:55:00,6138,"It was, apparently, a sweet deal, but I was only paying the gas for the trip."
773887,RickOnt,2013-03-15 21:02:00,669,"Hi Bruce  Glad you made the 'Best' of the situation you were presented with!  Good for you!  Word of mouth is the best advertisement and with this, the time of the information highway, bad press travels very fast.  Rick"
773896,Joey,2013-03-15 21:59:00,9122,"Well, as they say, at least you got out  Too bad you had to deal with the garbage  How long you figure the whitie had been ""deceased"" for?"
773897,davey buoy,2013-03-15 21:59:00,5505,"Not for awhile from what I seen this afternoon.   I swung by yesterday,Waters high,I can wait!!!Still ice!"
773930,bigugli,2013-03-16 01:08:00,6138,"The whitie had a good thick layer of white fuzz on him, so over a month."
