773021,Joey,2013-03-10 21:51:00,9122,"Went out for our last kick at the can for lakers and whities.  Nice and mild out there today and the sun made an appearance later in the day.  Paul had two on (and off   ) right off the bat, so things looked promising.  He was in good spirits even though he had just lost his second ""fish on""     There were too many follows to keep count of, but not alot of ""connections,"" although I did manage to keep this sweet lady on for a great fight  I won     And I got her on one of TJ's jigheads again, different colour this time.  Yay Due North Tackle     You will notice the line broke - whew, that was close!!!!         Caught a long distance shot of this big guy flying way down the lake.       The sun came out from behind a wall of clouds, just like that, cloud to sun, a nice, neat, straight line!!!      Met up with Nick (N.A.W.) on our way back and had a nice chat and made some possible future fishing plans     That was it for the fish.   On Saturday we traded our single trailer for a double and what a difference it made for packing (room)!!     Couple ducks at the parking lot.  Wish I had brought my good camera for these shots!           So that was our Sunday.  Really nice to be out there.  Guess it's perch from here on in   Hope everyone else had a great day"

773056,Cudz,2013-03-11 01:01:00,2652,nice. How was ice near shore? I want to get out tuesday but am hesitant.
773079,Joey,2013-03-11 02:53:00,9122,"Ice near shore was fine.  We had no problems at all.  It was worse two weeks ago!  There was alot of ice piled up on shore in some places I noticed, so maybe it blew in from the east and made the west side better?"
