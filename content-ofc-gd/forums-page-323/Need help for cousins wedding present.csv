I figure the perfect icing on the cake would be to book a charter for my cousin, his brother and myself for either Lake Ontario or the Niagara River.  Two things I've been having problems with. I checked the MNR website and I couldn't find a for sure answer, does the Niagara River count as zone 16 or zone 20?  Secondly and more important, I'm having trouble finding charters out of the Ontario side. Lots in the states by my cousins brother doesn't have a passport so thats out of the question.  Any help or reccomendations would be greatly apreciated.  Thanks."
