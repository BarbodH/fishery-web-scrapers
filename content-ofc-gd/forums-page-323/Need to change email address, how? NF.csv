I had problems registering using mine when signing up. The first time I registered all was fine, my user named appeared at the right side on top but it wouldn,t allow me to post. I know you have to wait some time for administration purposes but after a week I knew something was wrong. I tried to re-register using a different name but wouldn't accept new registration as it said email was already in use, used a different email and it worked. I searched the computer section here for a solution with no success.  I tried contacting administration but the email appears to go outbound only Please if someone could help it would be great."
