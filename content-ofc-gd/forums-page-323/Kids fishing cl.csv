773705,quickme,2013-03-14 14:15:00,261,"i bought my kids North Face rain jackets and they are very good.  Very windproof, waterproof and Breathable.  I bought them for $40 in a 2T and 4T.  I use it as layering in the winter and they are great spring and fall.   I think theres a north face store at vaughn mills if you wanna try.  I bought mine in the US so i'm not sure if they have stock up here."
