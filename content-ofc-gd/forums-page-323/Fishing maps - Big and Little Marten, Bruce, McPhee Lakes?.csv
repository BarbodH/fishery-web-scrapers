773428,Burtess,2013-03-13 00:22:00,901,"I am heading up to the Marten River area the third week in June and am looking to purchase detailed maps of these lakes.  I have checked a couple of fishing map websites and they only list ""Marten Lake"", which I assume is Big Marten but none of the others. Anyone know where (if) the others are available?  Thanks, Burt"
773434,irishfield,2013-03-13 00:37:00,26272,I've never heard of Big Marten and Little Marten... Marten Lake only. Adventure fishing maps has it. Let me dig some more...
773436,Rod Caster,2013-03-13 00:40:00,5784,"anglers atlas has a topo map online. Little Marten is on the north side of Marten Lake rd (it's really the river part), and Big Marten is on the south side of the road.  Not much info on Bruce of McPhee... you can get a fantastic area map at the Rock Pine Restaurant in Marten River, or go online and check out the ""friends of temagami"" website for the Ultimate Map, it's a really good wall map, but it's huge. You can get it a Lefevres in North Bay. Both those updated maps have trails, camp sites etc etc"
773437,Old Ironmaker,2013-03-13 00:46:00,8243,Visit the Canadian Centre for Inland Waters website. It is located below the Burlington Skyway bridge. All of my maps came from there before there was such a thing as the internet and people used topographical maps to fish. The facility is a must see place for anyone interested in Canadian fisheries. Great education for kids and adults. If they don't have a map you can bet a detailed map doesn't exist. Most Navionics and other electronic maps come from their resource library.
773439,irishfield,2013-03-13 00:47:00,26272,"So the ""Big"" lake is the SOUTH side of Marten Lake road.. and the ""Little"" is the river running North from there.. then West under HWY 11 and past the park.. then dumping into Red Cedar..."
773442,irishfield,2013-03-13 00:51:00,26272,Here.. haven't put these up in a while... North from the Rock Pine motel to the outlet damn. So I guess this is considered Little Marten Lake and Marten River.  
773445,Rod Caster,2013-03-13 00:55:00,5784,Here is a photo I took of the Friends of Temagami map on my wall  
773488,adempsey,2013-03-13 04:54:00,1498,"I have Marten Lake, but not the others.  "
773523,irishfield,2013-03-13 14:21:00,26272,"That's the whole thing Fishlogic.. what he's referring to as little and big. I guess Little is the long straight stretch on the East side of the highway and once it goes under the bridge it's the ""river"".  What I took aerials of is ""little"" and ""river""."
773606,Burtess,2013-03-13 21:17:00,901,"Thanks guys!  So I guess they just call it Marten Lake then and I can send off for that map.  They may have ""fishing"" maps up there at the stores I would imagine, I will check that out when I get there.  Burt"
773751,Deeds,2013-03-14 20:11:00,14,"I fish little Marten once in a blue moon and it's a fantastic lake, the river at the bridge can be a great spot to hit some pickies at opener. Hit up some of the islands and use shiners. The locals I know up there only use live bait and have owned those lakes. Another suggestion is Wicksteed Lake. Just a little further up on Marten Lake Rd there's a launch. Huge pickeral and pike up there. Nice size smallies too. You're hitting up a haven! Good luck!"
773755,reddog,2013-03-14 20:41:00,3,There is a store on the highway by the provicial park that carries the map of  Martin river but McPhee and Bruce aren't on it because of there size. I bought mine for $9.00.  Reddog
773772,IndySKS,2013-03-14 23:54:00,134,"In the photo posted by rod caster the body of water directly to the left of where martin lake is marked is what they call little martin lake. I think in the picture theres 2 red dots on it, West of the bridge on Martin lake road is just martin river. I'm not sure if you can get into McFee lake, last i have heard there was a beaver dam blocking access, I havent tried getting in the for about 4 years. McFee is fairly shallow with a mud bottom and very little stucture, not really my type of lake.  There is certainly a few good spots out there in Martin lake at the right time of year it can be very productive.  As for Wickstead i would consider it a far better lake to fish but be very careful getting in and out there is a lot of rocks and trees and some very narrow passages."
773774,IndySKS,2013-03-14 23:57:00,134,I think the best map i have seen of all 4 lakes is one from beaverland camp. You might try contacting them. It's a pretty generalized map but atleast it will give you some idea of where the different depths are and of course the rocks !
773778,Rod Caster,2013-03-15 00:45:00,5784,"Yup, the guys at Beaverland Lodge know their stuff!"
773781,Burtess,2013-03-15 01:01:00,901, Right on... this is the place we are staying at.  I am really looking forward to this week!  Burt
773803,Deeds,2013-03-15 07:01:00,14,"Albert and his wife are great, unfortunately they have put Beaverland up for sale. After talking with him this winter, he said he's ready to retire. He moved over to the Tilden Lake area. Still no buyers as of yet and Albert said it will be business as usual. Again, good luck!"
773809,IndySKS,2013-03-15 11:18:00,134,Well i hope you have a good week up there and the weather co operates for you. If your looking for some good eats the Rock Pine motel just across the hwy has some relativly new owners and the food is great and lots of it. You wont be disapointed.
773901,Musky or Specks,2013-03-15 22:20:00,2710,I don't know if MNR still carries them but almost every body of water has a mining survey map. Bathymetric. Call the local office and inquire. Doesn't give you any fishing details but is very similar to a hydrographic chart.
