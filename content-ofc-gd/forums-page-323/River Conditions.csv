I was just wondering if anybody had any information regarding the river conditions of the rivers in in the grey bruce area ( saug ) or ( sauble) or even the infamous river located in godrich....  Just wondering if there blown out or not too bad, was thinking of trying one out sometime this week, dont want to make the comute (2hrs) if there alredy blown out.  Thanks in advance.  Crappie Boy,"

773213,esoxansteel,2013-03-11 21:20:00,1307," Long range is calling for slightly cooler temps, below freezing at night, and around freezing or slightly above during the day, which should stop or slow runoff allowing rivers to clean somewhat, im re-doing a kitchen right now, but will be on the rivers by wednesday"
773223,kemper,2013-03-11 22:30:00,2232,"Right now, for the most part you will find this:    Give it a few days....  Of course there is always SOMEWHERE to fish"
