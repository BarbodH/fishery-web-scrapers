772975,Old Ironmaker,2013-03-10 18:04:00,8243,"I invite all you hunters out to Haldimand county for some varmint riddin'. We have been here since 96' and no one including life long residents has seen as many Coyotes and bushwolves than this winter. Someone said they are being driven out of their habitat by the construction of the wind turbines. I don't know the reason but they seem to be everywhere this year, and they are bold to say the least. Last Sunday night I saw at least 4 routing through garbage bags set out on the lakeshore for pick up. When I drove up to them they didn't seem to care at all. Hunger is a huge motivator. I didn't think they would scavenge, guess I'm wrong.  Come on out. Someone told me there is a bounty on them here, haven't hunted since after my 4th knee operation and am not up on the latest regs."
772976,Old Ironmaker,2013-03-10 18:06:00,8243,"By the way great job restoring your weapon, great job, congrats."
773047,Rustic-Fisher,2013-03-11 00:18:00,826,"Nice work, keep at em !!! I've had a few encounters now with the dogs and yotes."
773125,NAW,2013-03-11 12:40:00,4022,"Thanks for the comments everyone.  It sure was great to take that old broken down gun, and make it usable again."
773143,TJQ,2013-03-11 14:52:00,7806,Now thats something to be proud of!
773202,ch312,2013-03-11 20:49:00,1590," predator management through hunting and trapping are some of the most effective methods of controlling populations. you can thank those hunters and trappers who ""shoot stuff for fun"" for keeping coyote (and many other animals) populations in check which in turn helps the local deer, turkey, waterfowl, and small game. that said, why bother opening a thread titled ""coyote gun restoration"" if you're against the shooting of yotes?   NAW, it must have been very satisfying using that firearm to take this coyote. Very nicely done!"
773218,NAW,2013-03-11 21:57:00,4022,Thanks ch312!  I will be spending a few hours working on the pelt tonight.  To make things even better.  My neighbour introduced me to a group of local coyote hunters this weekend.  I guess these guys are the real deal.  I am very excited to learn from them.  Maybe take this to the next level.  The one hunter in te group that I talke to has shot 7 coyotes in my neighbourhood this winter.  It hasn't come close to putting a dent in the local population.

750981,Billy Bob,2012-12-11 12:09:00,5865,"I mostly use my .22-250 Rem, better know around here as ""Chuck Mate"" for woodchuck hunting in the spring if the crappie/perch fishing is slow. And she's so pretty too...take a look..   BTW last week I picked up my wife from a work Christmas party in the city of Buffalo and almost hit a coyote on Broadway right near the eastern boarder of Buffalo and Cheektowaga...son of a B ran right in front of my car...dog went NUTS in the car..."
750983,Billy Bob,2012-12-11 12:32:00,5865, Around here they look a LOT like Black Ducks....  ...right Sinker.....
751023,dave524,2012-12-11 17:39:00,4508," That reg has been on the books since I was first licenced back in 65. In the mid 70's I taught the safe gun handling for the MNR Hunter Safety, it was explained to me as to stop the usage of WWII mil surplus stuff in southern Ontario with milsurp full metal jacket bullets as they are very prone to ricochet. Most of the battle rifles of WWII were over .270."
751024,NAW,2012-12-11 17:47:00,4022,That sounds possible.  But the .223 (5.56 x 45mm) is a very popular standard nato round these days.  I guess maybe not back in the day when the law was created.
751079,bigbuck,2012-12-11 20:32:00,2449,"That actually makes sense. I agree with Nick, the 223 is around with a fair bit of steel Cored surplus around. They riccoshet like crazy. I think it is about time to get rid of that obsolete reg or modify it. It should specify the types of ammo allowed to be shot in the given areas."
751110,Billy Bob,2012-12-11 21:57:00,5865, That's what NYS does...no full metal bullets allowed for hunting..
751127,bigbuck,2012-12-11 22:48:00,2449,Same here. Only soft point ammunition. Military FMJ is for target shooting only.
751137,ch312,2012-12-11 23:14:00,1590,"very nice work. time to get some blood on that stock now   this is the most common reason i hear. as with sunday hunting, i guess it's time for hunters to voice our opinions to get thing's changed?  my yote gun, a stevens 200 in 22-250 topped with a 5-15x40 bushnell legend. it was only $300 new without the scope, but the little 1"" groups it shoots with cheap winchester ammo makes me forget about that.      first blood.    :whistling:   "
751171,NAW,2012-12-12 01:00:00,4022, Your not kidding.  Very nice looking gun!    No kidding.  $300 for both eh.  Was that used?  Did the 22-250 make that hole in the yote?  That's quit the gash!  Thanks for posting the pics of you guns guys!  I noticed your both using bi-pods.  That will be my first x-mass money purchase.  That and a good pair of Binos.  Any suggestions for either of the two items?
751229,Billy Bob,2012-12-12 11:06:00,5865,HARRIS Bi-Pod all the way....try Ebay for one...mine is over 30 years old...works like the day I purchased it...as far as binoculars...well that's a tough one...you can spend from $50 to $1500 on a good pair...my advice is get the best SMALLEST pair you can afford..  And my guess is that yote was shot with a .22-250 40 grain hollow point...but that side that is being shown is the EXIT hole...maybe ch312 can confirm.  Bob
751477,ch312,2012-12-13 02:31:00,1590," the stevens 200 jumped to $360 from $299 about 3 years ago. but, cabelas has them on sale for $299 right now and i highly recommend getting one. they really are THE best bang for your buck if you're looking for a low priced bolt action. i used that gun to shoot that yote at 50-60 yards offhand with 45gr winchester white box hollow points. aimed for the heart and i think i got it. cheap gun + cheap scope + cheap ammo = 1"" groups   i don't use gun mounted bipods as i'm 6'1 and even the tallest harris (IMO the best brand, be sure to get a swivel model) is too short for me while sitting. plus, they add too much weight to the gun for long carries and/or shooting offhand. i made the shooting sticks in my pic out of some old arrows and they're the best i've used so far and saved me over $100.  as for bino's, i use vortex crossfire 10x42 which are a tad on the big side for tracking deer, but they're manageable when used with a bino harness. vortex are newer, but their bino's are crystal clear and i preferred them over comparable models when i was shopping for them. i'd stick with 8-10 power..."
751487,BillM,2012-12-13 03:18:00,17367,I just picked up a Savage Axis XP Camo .270 today from Epp's.  Now I just gotta sight it in and go from there!
751527,bigbuck,2012-12-13 13:09:00,2449,"Wow, all this rifle talk has me hankering to punch some holes in paper. Bill, enjoy your new piece, may it bring a lot of meat to your table. Those Savages are supposed to be very accurate right out of the box. Let us know how she groups once you've sighted 'er in. Great deer gun and a backup piece for moose."
751537,NAW,2012-12-13 13:50:00,4022,"Nice purchase Bill!  I'm going to be sighting in the .222 this weekend on Saturday.  And thanks for the detailed info Ch312.  I like the idea of making a bi-pod my self.  I think I have some old arrows kicking around, Might try to make something.  If I get her shooting straight this weekend, I'll be sure to post some pics!"

772898,chris.brock,2013-03-10 03:28:00,4053," yeah, I hear ya, shooting stuff for fun isn't really my style either"
772911,NAW,2013-03-10 04:59:00,4022,"It has been a very busy winter in my home.  There hasn't been much time to get out hunting for coyotes.  But I promised my neighbor that I would try to take a few coyotes off his property this winter.  It's a mixed feeling for me, because I love dogs.  I serve on a K9 SAR unit, and own a dog.  But after seeing what the cyclical pattern of the Coyotes are doing to the local area.  I thought I would help out my neighbor.  We where set up and calling for about 20 minutes.  These coyotes ignored our calls and where heading for the barn.  I was able to stop the coyote quartering toward me slightly, at a distance of 175 yards.  The .222 was resting on my home made bi-pod.  This was the first shot I have ever taken on a coyote.  The gun snapped, and the coyote dropped instantly.       A clean, healthy coyote.  I am meeting with a good friend,and local trapper tomorrow. He's going to give me a lesson on how to process a coyote."
772912,bigbuck,2013-03-10 05:21:00,2449,"I guess your piece shoots straight. Nice going. Coyotes and wolves getting close in the country are a nuisance and a danger to livestock, not very great if you are a farmer. Easy for people in the city to poo poo shooting them until one of them kills rover or injures their kid or worse. Just dont let the skin go to waste. It should make you a nice little rug for your bedside so when you get up in the morning, you step on a warm skin and not a cold floor."
772927,Christopheraaron,2013-03-10 12:20:00,3525,"Nice one, seriously how much you want for that tail?"
772936,Leecher,2013-03-10 13:33:00,7832,Great job Nick   Good shooting
750698,BillM,2012-12-10 14:38:00,17367,"Looks killer Nick!  I still haven't been out for coyotes, if you're ever up for teaching a rube the ropes, let me know, lol!"
750703,NAW,2012-12-10 14:52:00,4022,  I already have one
750705,NAW,2012-12-10 14:55:00,4022," Let me get a few more notches under my belt before I start taking people out.  I'm a bit of a rube my self  But now that I can reach out and tough them, It should make things easier!"
750741,Billy Bob,2012-12-10 16:43:00,5865,NICE JOB and nice little caliber you don't see too much  of any more...and NO kick with that .222 so I wouldn't worry about being bit by the scope...
750744,NAW,2012-12-10 17:05:00,4022," Thanks BB.  Sounds like a 30-06, but kicks like a 22.  Perfect coyote caliber."
750765,hirk,2012-12-10 18:09:00,571,"Looks great, I have used boiled linseed and preferred it over tru oil,when hand rubbed with multiple coats its beautifull. The damp cloth helps bring out lite dents etc. but if you do it again try using a hot iron instead of a torch it may do a better job."
750766,NAW,2012-12-10 18:10:00,4022,  Hot Iron? Please explain.  Sounds interesting!
750768,bigbuck,2012-12-10 18:23:00,2449,A nice damp cloth placed over a ding letting it sit for a couple of minutes to let the wood absorb a bit of water then a hot iron placed on the damp cloth for a little bit should help to smooth out small dings in the wood. An old furniture makers trick. Let us know how she shoots.
750769,ecmilley,2012-12-10 18:27:00,2163,"looks real nice, now if i wanna restore my le 303 i sending it to you"
750779,bigbuck,2012-12-10 18:55:00,2449,"Ernie, the Enfields used a peocess called Suncorite on the receiver and barrel. Not sure how to duplicate that however the woodwork........"
750780,NAW,2012-12-10 18:59:00,4022,The guy I got the 222 from also has an Enfield 303.  But I don't think I would use it enough to make it worth my time.  I'm looking to get my hands on an old beat up 308 or 30-06 for my next re-build.
750789,ecmilley,2012-12-10 19:30:00,2163,"thanks learn something everyday, I'll try and take some pics i think it's in pretty decent shape other than a bit of tarnished brass on the buttplate"
750795,BillM,2012-12-10 19:45:00,17367,"Nick, can I use a 30.06 up your way for 'yotes?"
750809,NAW,2012-12-10 20:19:00,4022,"From the regs.   ""A person hunting small game may not carry or use a rifle of greater calibre than a .275-calibre rifle, except a muzzle-loading gun, in the geograhic areas of Brant, Chatham-Kent, Durham, Elgin, Essex, Haldimand, Halton, Hamilton, Huron, Lambton, Middlesex, Niagara, Norfolk, Northumberland, Oxford, Peel, Perth, Toronto, Waterloo, Wellington or York""  Simcoe / Springwater is not listed.   I could not find anything in the Simcoe or Springwater websites.  However, I have heard form several people that you can NOT use anything larger then .275 in my area.  I just can't find hard data to back it up.  So....  Yes you can  ?"
750815,Billy Bob,2012-12-10 20:29:00,5865,Kind of sounds like a .270 Win and down... weird reg....
750819,BillM,2012-12-10 20:48:00,17367,"I think I'll talk to a CO and make sure, lol."
750822,NAW,2012-12-10 20:55:00,4022, Let me know what the answer is.  I'd really like to know as well.
750843,bigbuck,2012-12-10 21:45:00,2449,Reason being is those areas are more heavily populated AND the deer for the most part aren't huge and there aren't any moose or elk requiring a large bore rifle.A Lee Enfield makes for a great deer gun or even moose gun if you are good with it. It has enough punch to put a moose or elk down inside 200 yards.
750846,Billy Bob,2012-12-10 21:49:00,5865,But many calibers smaller then a .275 travel MUCH farther....take a .270 Win...it shoots MUCH MUCH flatter and farther then .30/30 and the list goes on and on...that's why I said it's a weird reg.
750855,NAW,2012-12-10 22:02:00,4022," Ya, it's a weird rule for sure.  I thought it might be a noise issue.  Big caliber, big bang...  But it can't be that, because the guys pounding geese Saturday on mornings with the 10g pumps make a pile of noise."
750858,Billy Bob,2012-12-10 22:06:00,5865,"And I'm betting a 12 gauge shot gun using any kind of slugs are probably allowed...which if measured by caliber, dwarf all rifle bores...so that reg makes no sense whatsoever IMHO..."
750859,BillM,2012-12-10 22:09:00,17367, A 12 gauge doesn't have near the reach as your standard rifle does.  I've always assumed this is the reason why most rifles weren't allowed to be used closer to the populated areas.
750867,Billy Bob,2012-12-10 22:20:00,5865," EXACTLY...that's why that reg doesn't make sense making a cut off of .275 caliber...my .270 is a smaller caliber then any 30 caliber and there are LOTS of them...including the .30-06, .308 and the .30/30 which would NOT be allowed in that hunting area as per posted here...also my .22-250 Rem goes MUCH farther then any 12 gauge shotgun....see where I'm going here..it just doesn't make sense to me...I have heard of MANY lower calibers NOT allowed to hunt big game, like deer in many states down here...but none of has max caliber ""IF"" rifles are allowed in that area...some are shotgun only areas...here in NYS they have opened MANY counties that have been restricted to shotguns only to rifles because they have learned they are in fact safer....PA a few years ago did research on this and also confirmed rifles are safer then shotguns...in 2006 the county I hunt most for deer allowed rifles for the first time and no problems so far....and the population has probably double over the last 30+ years I hunted there......go figure..."
750879,BillM,2012-12-10 23:01:00,17367,"BB, perhaps whoever made up that reg thought bigger = further which we all know isn't the case, lol!"
750899,NAW,2012-12-11 00:03:00,4022,"Likely the same bunch responsible for no Sunday gun hunting.  Hey BB, do you do much Coyote hunting with the 22-250?  Great chamber for varment"
742115,NAW,2012-11-05 00:50:00,4022,"UPDATE: FINISHED PICS ADDED AT END OF THREAD.I have been on the market for a good coyote gun for the local dogs. But with a 8 week old boy at home, the budget is on lock down.My neighbor used to shoot a lot. Re-loaded all his rounds. He worked in a lab with a Bisbee Marksman. He had his Remington 722 .222 Rem. dialed in at 200 yards. Claims you could drive nails with it.He told me I can use it all i want if I fix it up. Hasn't been fired in 15 years. BUT, it comes with all the re-loading equipment and dies for .222 Rem!Specs:Remington Model 722Chambered for .222 Rem.Approx 1950 - 1960This is going to be my Coyote gun. Here's some shots from when he gave it to me a few weeks back. It was sitting in a steel locker in the moist cold area.Here is about 5 hours in to the restoration. I am almost ready to give the wood a coating. But I don't know what to use. It can't be reflective, or glossy, but needs to be a durable wood finish.I am really impressed with the quality of the wood that I found. The old gloss coat was in rough shape. But I bushed and scraped stripper for a few hours.The barrel was rusted on the outside, to that took a pile of polishing, around 2 hours.I still have to give is a thorough cleaning and oiling on the inside. Possibly re-blue the barrel, and give the wood a coating.I'll post up more pics of the fishing product if anyone wants to see it."
742120,dave524,2012-11-05 01:06:00,4508,"Fine old rifle, give the stock a few coats of Birchwood Casey ""TruOil"". Hope the bore is still good, I'd give it a cleaning with J-B bore cleaning compound."
742139,NAW,2012-11-05 02:09:00,4022, The bore is in good shape.  Thanks for the tip!  Do you have to apply the truoil every few years?  I am assuming it will really bring the natural grain finish out?  Water resistant as well?
742141,glen,2012-11-05 02:14:00,2641,52gr hpbt. 250y np.
742146,dave524,2012-11-05 03:10:00,4508," Don't put it on too heavy , multiple light coats is better. Yes a coat every year or so after the intial coats would be good.  It is water resistant. Even though it says truoil I believe it is a plastic with oil like properties.  Your old 222 has a slower twist rifling than is common today, probably best with bullets in the 40 to 50 grain tops range, if you are handloading for it."
742155,NAW,2012-11-05 03:48:00,4022," Thanks!  I think I will get in to the hand loading eventually.  But for now, I'm just going to go grab a few boxes and see what shots the best."
742161,backbay,2012-11-05 04:16:00,773,"Another vote for the Tru Oil, btw. Yes, water resistant, although not to the same extent as the poly."
742167,DRIFTER_016,2012-11-05 04:51:00,10439,I refinished my buddies old single shot 410 that he had since he was a kid. It spent a lot of time behind the seat of his pickup trucks over the years and was pretty beat up.  I refinished all the wood with Tru Oil and cleaned up and re-blued the barrel and action. The end result was an old firearm that looked like new!!!  My buddy was most impressed and very happy with the result.
742184,NAW,2012-11-05 13:04:00,4022, What did you use to re-blue the barrel?  I was thinking about doing it.
742213,DRIFTER_016,2012-11-05 16:25:00,10439,  Cold bluing purchased @ LeBarons. I followed the instructions and was impressed how easy it was and how well it turned out.  Outers Gun Blue Kit
742344,bigbuck,2012-11-06 13:25:00,2449,"There's plenty of videos on you tube on re bluing a firearm. You may as well take the barrel and action off of the stock to get the whole thing done. It will definitely look better once you refinish it. As long as the bore and rifling is intact, she will shoot real fine. The old Remington 700 series rifles were tack drivers out of the box. Try 2 or 3 different rounds but don't go with a real heavy bullet, you don't need it. Bore sight it once its back together and then dial her in nice at 200 yards and you will have a great shooter."
742359,NAW,2012-11-06 17:53:00,4022,"I just dropped 50 bucks at the local gun shop.  Got a blueing kit, and 50 rounds.  Gunna do a test fire this weekend.  I might have to order the truoil online.  He didn't have any in stock, but recommended I use ""Tung Oil"" from the hardware store."
742364,backbay,2012-11-06 18:59:00,773," Something I was going to mention was that if you go the Tru Oil route, (thin coats applied by hand), is that after your last coat has had time to dry, apply MinWax furniture wax and buff it after it drys. It's good stuff and will help protect the finish."
742372,dave524,2012-11-06 20:13:00,4508,"Tung Oil or Boiled Linseed oil will both darken the wood and hide the grain , do the Truoil."
742415,bigbuck,2012-11-06 23:42:00,2449,Its a utility rifle and started off in rough shape. Tung oil or the linseed oil will do fine. You don't need to go and spend a lot on this old gun. Spend your dough on ammo to learn how it shoots.

Wiping down with a lightly oiled cloth every now and again keeps the finish in great condition.  I've never heard of ""Tru-Oil"".  It sounds good to me."
750629,NAW,2012-12-10 03:11:00,4022,"I wanted it ready for January, and it is!  The gun turned out great.  I tried a technique to raise the grain by using a damp cloth and a torch.  It worked well.  Then I hand rubbed the stock to get the finish I was looking for.  The rust came off the barrel pretty good.  Some spots are beyond repair with out sending the barrel our for bluing after.  I stripped the trigger guard and some other components down to bare steel and re-blue'd them my self.  The finishing touch was a new scope that I grabbed at BPS earlier today.  For those who wanted to see the finished result, here it is!  Just a little detail work required around the grips, and she's ready to hammer some yotes!!            "

750637,cisco,2012-12-10 03:49:00,597,Looks like the new scope is placed way back from the original. Scope rule of thumb is for end to be about 1 1/2 inch behind trigger. Careful you don't get an 'eyering' when you shoot where the scope hits/cuts you around your sight eye. Put a coat on and close your eyes and raise the gun to your shoulder putting cheek onto stock like you're gonna shoot. Open your eyes to figure where the scope should be slid to for proper targetting. If the action won't work due to scope width then go with higher mounts.

750693,NAW,2012-12-10 14:04:00,4022," Thanks man!  PM me if you end up buy a gun that needs a little work.  They are easy to re-finish.  I would be more the happy to pass down the pointers that where passed down to me.   Thanks Jaques.  Should be a tack driver!   I knew someone would notice that! The new scope is longer than the old one.  So that is one reason for the difference.  Also, the old scope was mounted by the previous owner at least 25 years ago.  The gun is from the 50's.  So when he mounted the scope, he had to drill and tap new holes for mounting the scope bases.   Using the existing holes, this was the only position I could make it work. Fortunately, the scope placement works perfect for how I shoulder the gun.  There won't be any rings around my eyes!  Plus, this gun has very little kick. Thanks for commenting on that though.  I've mounted a few scopes in my day, and that's always the first thing on my mind!  Oh, and the action clear the scope by under 1/4"".  I will have to cycle some rounds thru, and make sure they don'y ting the scope on the way out!    That's the plan.  This weekend!  I really can not believe how well the gun came out.  It really does look like a new gun.  And it's around 60 years old!!"
