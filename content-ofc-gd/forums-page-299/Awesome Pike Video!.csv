I'm working on a full post but its gonna be a day or two before I am able to sort through all the pictures.. BUT  I put this video together of Moniques PB Northern! Small walleye rod, 8 lb fluorocarbon and NO leader!  "
794464,Lake Ranger,2013-06-24 19:07:00,70,"Way to go, Girl! Awesome catch! And the fish is pretty cute too!"
794466,TJQ,2013-06-24 19:16:00,7806,LOL I hope your talking about me and NOT the guide...
794473,solopaddler,2013-06-24 19:41:00,8605,"Nice fish, congrat's to Monique! Pickeral Point? That spot looks awfully familiar."
794475,TJQ,2013-06-24 19:48:00,7806,Mike... lol.. there a reason the big ones are there.. we pulled up easily 70 pickeral before landing that one...
794477,TJQ,2013-06-24 19:54:00,7806,and that was in a couple of hours...  I LOVE listening to that line peeeeeeellllllll.....
794478,Moosebunk,2013-06-24 19:56:00,3970,"Pink!!!  Pink!!!  Pink!!!  Take one color grub for walleye to Kesagami and it HAS to have pink.  Not an incidental catch by any means either, 1/3 of Kesagami's 40+ inch fish are caught when fishing light for walleye.  Cool video.  Betchya Monique's knees were shaking just a little reeling that beauty in."

794656,ehg,2013-06-25 11:25:00,2666,That i an awesome video of an exceptionally well fought fish. The drag on the reel was perfectly set. Good stuff!
794759,TJQ,2013-06-25 21:20:00,7806,  Funny you say that... the day before we lost a nice one.. well Monique lost a nice one cause i decided to adjust the drag mid fight.... now theres a lesson learned... it was pretty quiet in that boat for a while.....
