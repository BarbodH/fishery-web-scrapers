793577,Spanky80,2013-06-19 21:49:00,152,"I live just downriver from Oiseau Rock, on the river in Macgregors Bay.  Hope you have a great trip Fishindevil, the walleye are hitting pretty good this week.  Where are you staying?  I'll be out the next two days too, weather looks good!"
793588,fishindevil,2013-06-20 00:03:00,6254,Hey spanky I fish macgregors bay a lot also high view short turn and petawawa point !!!!! Well pretty much the whole river I'm staying on the water near petawawa point!!!! Cheers shoot me a pm !!!!!!
793593,Spanky80,2013-06-20 01:04:00,152,"Good stuff Fishindevil, hope you have a great trip.  The weather for the next couple of days anyways looks pretty good!  I am downriver from Petawawa Point, close to Pine Ridge Park.  I am familiar with the Point, thats where I launch the bass boat when I am fishing the Ottawa.  I have a 14' tin Sylvan that I leave in front of my place that I will be out in tomorrow morning.  Highview is a good spot, the only issue might be the high water level and strong current.  Don't be shy to try in amongst the islands along the Ontario side coming back towards Petawawa, look for points and shelfs off of those islands.  Drifting and vertical jigging down by Pine Ridge where the lighthouse is on the Quebec side is also a good option, thats where I am tomorrow.  Tight lines!  Shayne"
793622,fishindevil,2013-06-20 06:56:00,6254,I'm staying at pine ridge park !!!! See ya on the water
793627,fish_fishburn,2013-06-20 11:46:00,1311,"Well it was an eventful trip out on the water yesterday. The exercise of the day was for the g/f to get the boat ready all by herself Shes a new boater and I am teaching her the ropes. I get to her place and the boat is all ready to go. She hooks it up to the truck and were off.  We launch the boat and head down river. On the way I decide to check the gas tank. Go figure, less than a 1/4 tank on board. I dont say anything and only go half as far as I had planned. We set up our rods and start a troll heading in the homeward direction. about 1 hr into the troll chug chug chug stall. Pump the buld she fires up again and a minute later she dies again.  So I pump the bulb again and start it up and tell her to take over driving while I change my bait. Sure as heck it dies again. She says what the heck and looks at me for help. I tell her to go through the starting procedures and she does but it wont start. The she happens to check the gas and there is none. lol You should of seen the look on her face, priceless. Lift the motor and put down the electric motor and troll home. I can almost gaurentee she will never run short on fuel again. No fish by the way but a good lesson in boat preperation. lol"
793789,fishindevil,2013-06-21 09:24:00,6254,Hey fish burn we have all had those days !!!!! Ya it was a tough fish yesterday !!!!

793960,RJackson,2013-06-22 17:57:00,113,Enjoy your time up our way Shawn.  Lookin like a walleye sky today for ya!  RJ
794196,Spanky80,2013-06-23 20:23:00,152,"Hey Shawn, great meeting you and your g/f this weekend!  We ended up with five keepers, definately tough sledding this season on the Ottawa.  High water level, cold water temperatures and very murky water have contributed to a tough spring for sure.  We took a break Saturday (so I could install my air conditioner, thank gawd!), today we left early for Lake Clear.  Perfect morning but the results didn't know it again..."
