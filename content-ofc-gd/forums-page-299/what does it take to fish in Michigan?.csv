794737,BillM,2013-06-25 18:30:00,17367,All you need is a license..
794740,aplumma,2013-06-25 19:15:00,6896,just a license and conform to the Canadian rules of equipment/ safety  needed on the water. Your life vests do not have to be Coast Guard approved as long as they comply to the Canadian rated rules with a tag on them.   Art
794743,DRIFTER_016,2013-06-25 19:23:00,10439,Might need to have proper ID as well. Passport or Enhanced DL.
794768,Bob Devine,2013-06-25 22:03:00,251,Proper id is important but not necessary. Good to have in case of an emergency to land. The USCG does require a throwing  ring or seat cushion in addition to the items required by CCG.
794778,FloatnFly,2013-06-25 23:34:00,1640,"you will need a passport, and a way of contacting customs, its best to have anytime you cross over the border, be it by water or by car.  even if you don;t think they're watching you, they are"
