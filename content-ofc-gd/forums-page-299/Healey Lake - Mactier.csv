I understand there are LB/SB and Pike - and maybe Walleye?  Last report I could find on the Board was from 2007 - but nothing was posted on how the fishing was, etc.  Anyway - always fun to try out a new lake.  I will try to post what I get - if anything.  Heading up 2nd week of July."

793548,Cosmos,2013-06-19 19:11:00,588,"I caught pike, small mouth, crappies.  People told that trout is in the lake as well."
793768,Guest MusicCityAngler,2013-06-21 02:53:00,0,"I have  cottage near McTier, and have fished Healy two or three times.  It is one of the better lakes in the area for bass, with a variety of structure- deep, shallow, rock, weeds, etc.  I remember we had great fishing just before sunset on a bay that you enter through a narrow inlet on the south side of the lake.  I mainly fish for bass, so can't comment about the crappie, pike, or trout.  But I hope you find some crappie, as I am looking for a lake to fish them.  Since this is your first time at Healy,  it would be helpful to get a map of the lake.  I would suggest adventure fishing maps.  They are not perfect, but I find them very helpful when fishing a lake I am not familiar with.   Their web site is www.adventurefishingmaps.on.ca, and I think they cost about $15.  Maybe we could get together for a day of fishing.  Unfortunately, I am not computer literate enough to know how to PM you.  Would appreciate it if someone could help."

793982,Skud,2013-06-22 20:06:00,739,The trick is to take a great fisherman like me along with you for a day so I can show you how and where to catch them fishes. I will bring a few of my 'go to' lures.
794408,hutch4113,2013-06-24 15:20:00,374," The problem is, i have seen your go to lures...they don't work.  hahahahahahahaaha.  Was out in Simcoe yesterday - went out to Thorold.  Didn't get anything.....but had a really really really nice follower.  Maybe if I had a go to lure, he might have bit.  Oh well..."
