The food and nightlife experience has been phenomenal and the fishing is pretty good! I admit, I've had huge withdrawals fishing the rivers for salmon and steelies, but I've managed to find a few gems to hold me down.  The St Lawrence river is a huuuuuge water system with a steady current. Many species of fish call this water system their home and I've had the pleasure of encoutering a few of its resident fish.  American shad fishing was quite interesting. Using shad darts was something new and fishing shoulder to shoulder is such an understatement. lol The locals love their shad and they are definitely amazing fighters at the end of your line.  I look forward to discovering more gems around the cityâ€“it's been fun so far!          "
