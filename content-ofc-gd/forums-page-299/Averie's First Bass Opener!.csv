Yeah, it's just another fish season opening up, but it has become a tradition for myself and my old man to go out a the crack of dawn and brave the thousands of boats that descend on Long Point Bay the last Saturday of June.  My parents live 7 hours away so spending time on the water with my dad is something I really look foward to.  This year meant even more to me as I was taking Averie out for her first ever Bass Opener.  The excitement really was just like the night before Christmas and I coudln't convince her that she had better get to sleep because 4 a.m. comes fast.    As most of you know, Averie is my little girl and my fishing partner.  She's quite the little angler, but for hte past six years she's fished exclusively for largemouth like this one on our local reservoir...  Opener on Longpoint is all about smallies for us, and the bulldogging and jumping that comes along with them.. I couldn't wait for Averie to finally experience smallmouth bass fishing!    It was fairly windy and a bit of a rough ride out, and even though we were pretty well soaked by the time we got started, the kid was all smiles!         We got set up and it didn't take long to start cracking off fish... but they sure as heck weren't fighting and jumping like the smallies I was telling her about...  First fish of the day...    First double header for Averie and Gramps... lol    Next up Averie hooks into what would have easily been our biggest fish of the day and loses it boatside... She was pretty upset for a short while but as soon as she caught this little guy she was all smiles again... Her first ever smallmouth bass..    We actually struggled a little bit at first, but after moving around a few times and trying a few different things, we figured out a game plan and laid a pretty solid beat-down on the fish.  We certainly didn't catch any true giants but we caught a TON of fish and had a great time doing it!  I mostly took pictures of Averie because she kept asking me to! lol  She's mastered the long-arm pose and is shameless with her missing teeth! haha            Dad and gramps actually caught their fare share of fish to! )  They ate everything from tube jigs to spinnerbaits and jerkbaits!    They got into a few doubles with the smallies to....    But the fish of the day came on an old school white twister tail rigged on a drop-shot and boy did Averie every take up the family tradition that is to remind everybody who caught the biggest fish... lol    She held a top ten place in the 17 & Under division until shortly after 1 pm with her PB smallie...    It was another great Longpoint bass opener and a day that Averie, my Dad and I will always remember!    Can't wait until next year!  Enjoy you week folks!  Cheers, Ryan"
