My son and I tried before dark when 10 minutes in this young lad hooks into a fish and looks decent from the bend in the rod.  Another guy netted it and I got a picture which measured 20"".  20 minutes later it started pouring....hmmmm  Mystery angler and his released prize.  Wish I caught for team 6 hahaha! (date is wrong, i reset something by mistake lol)  "
