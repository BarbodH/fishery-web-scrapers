794249,kickingfrog,2013-06-23 23:45:00,8333,"A spinnerbait can be a great choice for both pike and bass. It is somewhat weedless, allows you to cover some water and can be fished at just about any of the depths that you will be fishing."
794254,dhickey,2013-06-24 00:07:00,1038,You may want to buy a map of Simcoe. Work points  and drop offs that lead into a small flat section. Failing that bring some worms and 2 inch shiners for perch. Good luck.

794286,danc,2013-06-24 01:44:00,4677,"If you were in my neck of the woods, I'd offer this. Find water. Put a hook of any kind on your line. Then cast and retrieve. Then catch all the Pike that you want to. I can do this 1000 yards from my front door,  but never do. It would probably be easier to explain how not to catch a Pike up here."
