794454,SlowPoke,2013-06-24 18:13:00,2984,I'm in the same boat (groan) but I have another year before the fire sale lol
794493,Terry,2013-06-24 20:43:00,14456,"I hate to say it but the guys are bang on, you just may be better parting it out  the boat works for you  so get a second job , put the girls to work and keep the boat you love"
794494,muskymatt,2013-06-24 20:48:00,2608,So. If I were to part it out. What would just the stripped down boat be  worth ?
794500,DRIFTER_016,2013-06-24 21:11:00,10439, $1000-$1500 but you could probably get double that from a Sens fan as they are very gullible.
794508,aplumma,2013-06-24 21:48:00,6896,"If you sell it are you going to get another boat? If so what amount are you looking to spend on the new boat and what size will it be? You might be able to sell just the boat and the big motor and use the rest of the toys in your other boat you are getting. Just an idea I know down here in the States you would be lucky to get $8,000.oo because it is not what you perceive the value of the boat is it is what will someone pay for it.  I have invested around $14,000.00 in a VW convertible with over 150 hours of love into it I would be lucky to get $9,000.oo out of it but I built it to keep and enjoy.   Art"
794511,misfish,2013-06-24 21:55:00,29133," Bang on.  We always think it,s worth more."
794520,trevy727,2013-06-24 22:38:00,351,"List it at whatever you want. It can't hurt to put it on kijiji, auto trader, etc at $17000. Who really knows? Maybe someone's looking for that boat."
794524,boombap,2013-06-24 22:47:00,310,"I have a friend who has invested $20 grand into a 5.0 stang, and that's just the engine. It's a great car, but he knows he would be very lucky to get 8-10k"

794182,Christopheraaron,2013-06-23 18:38:00,3525,"20 bucks? LOL, good luck with the sell"
794183,muskymatt,2013-06-23 18:42:00,2608,  It would be minus the water stains. lol
794188,misfish,2013-06-23 19:21:00,29133,Thats some nice ponys pushing it. The year of the boat is whats giving me the pricing problem on this package.
794190,muskymatt,2013-06-23 19:27:00,2608,"The book value  on the boat alone in 6k. And  its been totally overhauled , with some customizing"
794209,trevy727,2013-06-23 21:31:00,351,$15000
794210,porkpie,2013-06-23 21:38:00,2521,"Book value on an old hull is worth exactly what someone is willing to pay.  All the add ons are awesome, but that hull is going to hurt you terribly wether or not the work has been done to it!  People won't pay much for a hull of that vintage and it hurts the overall picture.  That's the trouble with doing up a rig like that unless your in it for the long haul!  Sorry I can't evaluate a price for you, but best of luck!"
794211,danc,2013-06-23 21:39:00,4677,SOLD!!

794257,muskymatt,2013-06-24 00:16:00,2608,"Never watched it, apologies if I misinterpreted your comment."
794284,Lape0019,2013-06-24 01:40:00,647,"I would suggest trying to part it out. All if your add one will fetch good money but as pork pie said, the hull is going to hurt you. You might get lucky though. For $15000.00 I would be tempted to grab it and swap out everything on my current boat and sell the hull separately"
794374,SlowPoke,2013-06-24 13:32:00,2984,"I have to agree. The value is there but the buyer may not be. I did an extensive rebuild on my '87 Starcraft CC including full aluminium floor, everything short of new paint and motor. The intent was to keep it for a long time and those enhancements would pay for themselves. I was in the process of shopping for a new motor when I came across the perfect boat (for me) at a serious discount. (New, non-current $10k off) I had no trouble selling the CC because the value was there, the buyer was in love with it and didn't need financing for $6,000. Not everyone will have $15,000 cash to spend on an older boat; financing it will be tough and somebody with a line of credit is probably going to go the new route. Here's the good news... You have a CC and they're not easy to come by, especially aluminium. You'll have that market (albeit small) to yourself."
794387,BillM,2013-06-24 14:22:00,17367,"Compare what else you can get for 15k (especially in the used market) and I doubt anyone would pay that for this boat.  Regardless of the accessories attached, it's still 24yrs old....   I'd expect closer to 10k."
794400,bigbuck,2013-06-24 15:02:00,2449,"Probably 8-10k. Not what you want to hear but its an old hull, refurbed or not, its old. Good luck!!"
794405,BucktownAngler,2013-06-24 15:13:00,582,i bet a coat of paint would go a long way in increasing the potential value.  any pics of the inside?
794412,misfish,2013-06-24 15:36:00,29133,"I was going to say the same. Didn't want to come across as a low baller. 10 would be my max, if it were I. Good luck with the sell."
794422,muskymatt,2013-06-24 16:21:00,2608,"Thanks for the input guys.  Just can't get my head around the pricing though even if it is an older hull.  Its aluminum and in top shape , shouldn't that be what matters ? The etec are  $13, 000 new, this still has 2.5 yrs warranty left. The kicker was almost $6000 alone and is only 4 yrs old the I pilots are $1500. That's almost $20, 000 of power within the last 4 yrs not including anything else, like the $3500 new trailer. Its got to be worth more than $8-10 , no? Maybe breaking it down wold be the way to go instead of basically giving it away."
794435,SlowPoke,2013-06-24 17:02:00,2984,"I feel for ya, bud! The problem you face is none of this is over-the-counter new. The ETEC is worth about $7500-$8000, Merc $2500-$2800, Terrova $900-$1100... we've already chiseled you down to $11,900 on power. You're taking a bath on depreciation and taxes just because this stuff doesn't ring through a cash register. It sucks but I really think that's the way it is. I don't think anybody can question the value in this package and I'm just throwing out numbers off the top of my head, so keep that in mind. I just don't think that finding the right buyer will come easily. You might do a lot better by finding a suitable used engine to match the vintage of the hull and sell the power items/electronics separately. Can I ask why you're selling it? I've seen it on the MCI forum and you've done a great job!"
794440,muskymatt,2013-06-24 17:17:00,2608,I have 2 girls starting university so I'm looking at 15-20grand a yeas for the next 4-5 yrs. Its killing me but has to be done.
794442,BillM,2013-06-24 17:20:00,17367,"You'd probably be better parting it... It's got some great accessories on it, but people are going to see that it's a 1989 hull and shy away from it.."
794448,fishnsled,2013-06-24 17:40:00,3520,   I'd say these guys are pretty much in line with a 10-12K price.  The older haul is the killer but a coat of paint and you never know what will happen.  Can always start off at 15K and come down from there.  It certainly sucks after all the money you put into her.  You might do better at parting it out.
