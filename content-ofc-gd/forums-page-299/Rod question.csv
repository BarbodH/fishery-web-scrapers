794059,Pickeral eater,2013-06-23 01:55:00,155,Hey all!  Just a quick question. I recently had a door shut on my new ultra light rod and it broke two guides down from the top so it's not a case of repairing the tip only.  Is it worth trying to fix it or is it a write off??  Thanks Bill
794067,kickingfrog,2013-06-23 02:14:00,8333,"How long was it? How much was broken off? You could put a tip top guide on the end and, if necessary, adjust the line guides to suit the new length. The rod won't fish the same but still might be very serviceable. Whether or not this is makes financial sense or not?"
794077,Pickeral eater,2013-06-23 02:45:00,155,"It's 7 foot that lost the top 9"".  I bought it this year for crappie as  I've never owned an ultra light and wanted to experience the difference. So if its not going to perform the same maybe  ill just scrap it."
794082,Sinker,2013-06-23 03:20:00,8692,What kind of rod? You may be able to buy a new top half.  S.
794087,dhickey,2013-06-23 03:57:00,1038,Its now a trolling rod . Fix the tip and put a bigger real on it.
794109,DropShot'r,2013-06-23 11:20:00,62,Give the tackle shop that you got the rod at a phone call and see what they will do for you.  Check rod manufacturers web site for info about broken rods.   Steve
794193,Pickeral eater,2013-06-23 20:04:00,155,Thanks for the advice guys   the rod is a shimano Clarus.  I like the idea of using it for a trolling rod. I believe it's rates for 2-6 lb line. What would the rod be able to handle now?
794632,chefboi17,2013-06-25 06:10:00,128,"The clarus line has a lifetime warranty, I don't know if most stores do over the counter exchanges any more, but if you send it in, they should replace it"
794634,Moosebunk,2013-06-25 06:21:00,3970,"  Used one of those rods for years.  2-6lb UL 6 1/2 footer.  So... now you have a 6.3 or a 6.  It'll still do plenty for ya, and well too."
794671,Pickeral eater,2013-06-25 13:20:00,155,
794672,Pickeral eater,2013-06-25 13:21:00,155,Awesome thanks!! Bill
794683,BillM,2013-06-25 14:00:00,17367,"Send the rod back to Shimano, they'll ship you a replacement."
794688,4x4bassin,2013-06-25 14:23:00,1025,"I see you live in Mississauga , give Aikmans a call at 905 277 3595 . If it can be fixed/replaced under warranty they will help you out . Been dealing with them for years and no problems or questions asked !"
794691,jedimaster,2013-06-25 14:47:00,3472,Aikmans doesn't do returns for Shimano rods anymore. At least not when I went there a year ago.
794693,4x4bassin,2013-06-25 15:06:00,1025,They are kinda out of the shimano rod business when it comes to warranties yes (too many scammers) but give them a call anyway and they will help you or at the very least point you in the right direction .
794720,Pickeral eater,2013-06-25 16:31:00,155,"Many thanks guys, I'll give aikmans a call.  Thanks again Bill"
794744,aplumma,2013-06-25 19:25:00,6896,The warranty is for defective rods not rods that are broken from a door. I am sure they will help with a replacement but expect to pay for it.    Art
794755,lookinforwalleye,2013-06-25 21:08:00,4399,I think the Pickeral eater meant to say he set the hook into a stump and the tip broke!!!
794760,Pickeral eater,2013-06-25 21:21:00,155,That's exactly what I meant !!!
794824,Dabluz,2013-06-26 02:51:00,701,"Add a tip top guide and use the shorter rod for other fishing.  Actually, you may find the rod is now perfect for finesse fishing for walleye or small mouth bass using 4 to 6 lb mono (1/8 to 1/4 once jigs etc).   Most ultra light rods I have come across are way too wimpy anyway."
