In efforts to save on gas, looking to stay south of Cook's Bay shoal, but if a run to Long Island is worth it ......?  Largies in visible structure (reeds/pads/banks) are easy and looking more for deep water help, but any help with Cook's Bay would be appreciated,  PM, email, text or phone will work.  I'm flexible for any help offered.  Thanks in advance, Mark"
