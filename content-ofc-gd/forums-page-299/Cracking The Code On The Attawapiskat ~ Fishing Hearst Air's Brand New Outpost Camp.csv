791941,TJQ,2013-06-11 13:08:00,7806,Wow... but where are the BIG fish lol.. nice stuff..  truly a trip for the books!!
791970,wallyboss,2013-06-11 14:43:00,1095,Gorgeous colors on those walleyes which is typical for Northern Ontario.   Love all the pix's
792054,K_F,2013-06-11 19:44:00,107,"Unreal report Mike, thanks for taking the time to post.  Glad to see the timing of everything worked out for you."

792137,Aaron Shirley,2013-06-12 00:50:00,655,"The Terminator Titanium leader material is exceptional. I started using it years ago and haven't looked back.It has many attributes that make it ideal for pike fishing. For one, it resists kinking unlike traditional stainless steel leaders. Second, it has quite the stretch to it similar to mono. It is bite-proof and ties easily. Another huge plus for me, is the fact that I can tie direct to braid (or mono/fluoro if you choose) with an albright knot.This is very useful when using light lures like a Husky Jerk. The leader material is so light and thin, that is is like not even using a leader, especially 20lb that I use so much. With no additional weight from a swivel, it doesn't add that bit of extra weight to place the nose down on a light lure like Husky Jerk. I put a light snap on the business end with a clinch knot to change up lures easily. I use a pair of pliers to pull on the tag end to get a good tight knot.  For larger lures like spoons, in-line buckails etc, I use 30lb titanium and add a small black swivel rather than tie an albright direct to the braid. This helps with line twist.  It has been a very effective tactic for me. I like making my leaders approximately 18"" to 24"" as it adds a bit more stretch for violent head shakes when using braid, and the extra length allows to re-tie the snap on after a while. The titanium will wear over extended use and must be re-tied a few inches up so that no breakage occurs. I made the mistake of trying to get away with the same leader all week and it cost me the biggest fish of the trip on Thursday and a lost lure. I normally get a week of fishing before having to re-tie the snap, but the Attawapiskat had too many big violent pike! lol"
792200,ehg,2013-06-12 11:28:00,2666,"Thanks for taking the time providing another multimedia fishing extravaganza!  Has the feel of an old time fishing article/show being so well written. Great stuff!  Oddly one of my favourite reports by you was the one where you took the family blueberry picking up on hill in QC.    Again, very well done!"
792221,fisherman7,2013-06-12 13:54:00,325,"Great report as usual. I was there in 2006 when the camp was called Kissing Otter. They didn't have the second cabin in though. Great fishing then and I can see it hasn't changed. Loved sitting up on the deck after a day of fishing and taking in the view. Glad to hear Hearst Air is going there and I may just go back, but Pym Island is still my favourite of all of Hearst Air's camps. Particularly if Harry's the guide."
792232,LeXXington,2013-06-12 14:40:00,1928,Wow that is some excellent fishing. Thanks for the pics
792247,Lunkerhunter,2013-06-12 16:12:00,455,amazing report! i definetely have to get up there one day. thanks for sharing

792495,corvette1,2013-06-13 23:11:00,1765,What a trip to the Attawapiskat River!  It was great fishing with Mike and Aaron.  What an experience for Kevin and me....even with the snow.  I would highly recommend Heart Air's Fly-In Outpost....great people and service....the camp was excellent.  Never used freighter canoes....they were stable and tons of room...I liked them better than the normal 14' aluminum boats you usually get.  Lots of walleye and pike....that's for sure.               
792507,mattyk,2013-06-14 01:06:00,2110,what an amazing report! Thanks for taking the time to share this.
792590,The Urban Fisherman,2013-06-14 19:44:00,2050,Speechless.  Thank Mike - that was awesome!
792604,Loadman,2013-06-14 21:44:00,63,"Mike, I heard the water was even higher this year? to the tune of 10'?? I know when I went last year it was around 7' above.... great trip it looks tho. Some nice fish"
792751,Aaron Shirley,2013-06-16 03:00:00,655,Nice photos Doug. It was great to spend a week with you guys and have such an awesome trip!
792992,chris.brock,2013-06-17 02:37:00,4053,"what an adventure, I've said it before, I'll likely say it again, you're a lucky guy  good call on bringing the extra gas and extra outboard on the long trip down river, pretty ballsy day trip due to the remoteness"
793093,solopaddler,2013-06-17 17:18:00,8605,"Thank's guys, the response to this one has been overwhelming. Not surprising though, it was a true trip of a lifetime. I've been away on another fly in the last week or so, just got back. Once again an amazing trip. Should have something posted later this week.     For sure Harold!   Yes it was SUPER high! We had to adapt to the conditions and travelled a LOT to find the fish. I believe under normal water conditions the fishing would be even better.   No kidding!! What I didn't mention was we also had a sat phone with us for safety so it wasn't all that ballsy.  Thanks bud. And that trip to Mont Cheminis is one of my favourites too. We're tentatively heading back there again in August.   Amazing that you've been to that camp!! The Kissing Otter plaque is still tacked up on the front of the main cabin. How'd you make out when you were there?"
793698,Fishenforcer,2013-06-20 18:45:00,18,Looks like a trip of a lifetime to a world class fishery!!! Will definitely be looking at booking a trip with Hearst Air.
794126,snaggermeister,2013-06-23 13:26:00,6,"It's always great reading your trip reports Mike. This one looks like another epic Fishing adventure. How would this compare, adventure wise, to some of the other big river walleye and Pike you have done in the past?"
794275,Basskicker,2013-06-24 01:04:00,421,"Looks like you guys did rather well, thanks for putting up this report for all of us to see.....really much appreciated!!"
794335,solopaddler,2013-06-24 09:21:00,8605,"Adventure  wise? Nothing compares. We did a 90km round trip twice, it was truly incredible country.   Thanks! How did you guys make out on Nipigon when you went?"
791587,Skud,2013-06-10 04:19:00,739,Looks like heaven up there. Great pics!
791598,fishindevil,2013-06-10 07:27:00,6254,Wow !!!! Epic trip mike & Aaron !!!! That's insane fishing ..... Huge walleyes huge pike !!!!!! Amazing great vids too !!!!!!! Cheers
791625,msp,2013-06-10 12:34:00,1336,Well done Mike Looks like you guys got quality and quantity I noticed in some of the pictures you are using flouro leaders. Did you try the tieable titanium leaders ? Any review or comments about leader material ? Thanks
791631,pikeandtina,2013-06-10 12:46:00,1,"Mike, Thanks for posting! Looks like you tore 'em up with the Mepps! Glad you had a great trip! John"
791634,Roy,2013-06-10 12:57:00,13728,"As usual with your reports Mike...what can I say.. Just the best of the best. Super pics, video and trip description."
791644,solopaddler,2013-06-10 13:47:00,8605,"Thanks guys, glad you enjoyed!   Yes I have come to a definitive conclusion about the leaders, especially after this trip. The 20lb tieable titanium leader wire made by Terminator is THE BEST! It's so incredibly thin and ties very easily. It's a fantastic product for thowing lighter stickbaits as it doesn't impede the action at all. We caught oodles of large pike using the 20lb with zero issues.  Anything heavier than 20lb I have no use for, it's too hard to tie at least for me.  I also used the Tuff Line leader material as well as a tieable nylon coated metal made by Surflon. I liked neither of these especially the Tuff Line it was way too thick and visible and frayed easily. The Surflon is nice and thin and less visible but doesn't stand up to any abuse either.  I always have some pre tied fluoro leaders with me on these trips and did use them on occasion when throwing non finesse baits like bucktails and spoons. They're bulletproof too."
791657,msp,2013-06-10 14:35:00,1336,Thanks for the response Mike. This year I made the switch to 100# Seagaur premier flouro leader. I was suprised how well it performed with smaller stick baits. It did not seem to impede the action of the bait and back to back uni knots worked well but...... We had 2 bite offs. 1 bite off I think the fish hit the mainline when attacking the bait. The other break off the fish engufed the bait head first but sliced through the 100# quite easily. Where did you puchase the tieableTerminator leader? I cant seem to find it anywhere on line or in stores
791660,solopaddler,2013-06-10 14:42:00,8605, I bought it at Bass Pro pretty sure. Aaron had a bunch of it too as he's sponsored by Rapala who also handles Terminator.
791661,fishnsled,2013-06-10 14:48:00,3520,Stellar report Mike!!  Thanks for taking the time to fix up the links for all to enjoy.  Another fly in adventure added to the bucket list.

791673,Jds63,2013-06-10 15:24:00,1365,was wondering how you guys did .... What an amazing report Mike !!   great photos and write up ...
791682,Tomcat,2013-06-10 16:02:00,395,Thanks so much again for allowing most of us to vicariously enjoy such a trip north. Don't ever wonder whether your efforts to put these reports together are not truly appreciated by everyone. I was wondering whether you always try to arrange for Otters on your fly-ins? Do you guys ever eat northerns or do you always eat walleye on these trips?
791683,Peps,2013-06-10 16:02:00,191,"HOLY SMOKES!!!!!! Mike your reports never get old, truly a pleasure to read!!!  on my ""Bucket List"" would be a trip to the Attawapiskat with the ""GREAT"" Mike Borger"
791712,blaque,2013-06-10 18:17:00,2419,"Fires me up everytime........Truly appreciate the time taken to not only upload all the photos and vids, but the time and effort that goes into documenting the trip while your there is a bunch of work as well. Pulling out the camera in some of the conditions i see you fishing in can truly be a pain in the arse, and when theres fish like this waiting for your next cast......it can be easy to want to give the camera a rest.  So again, .....MUCH appreciated  P.S. Friends shouldnt let friends pike fish with bare feet, ........And yes i speak from experience........YEOOOOW! Husky Jerk right between the toes"
791719,solopaddler,2013-06-10 18:49:00,8605,"Thank's gent's, your comments are much appreciated!   Glad you enjoyed! The type of plane really depends on the distance involved, outfitter, and circumstances. We flew in on an otter on this trip because a bunch of gas and supplies went in with us. We actually flew out in a turbo Beaver.  I fly on Tuesday to Little Missinaibi lake north of Chapleau. It's a standard Beaver and our weight limit is a strict 100lb's per person. That's damn hard to adhere to when your tackle weighs 30lb's and case of beer weighs 25lb's LOL!  I'm actually a huge pain in the arse. You'd hate me if you met me.   VERY kind words and greatly appreciated. I'd love to see photo evidence of the Husky Jerk incident."

791447,solopaddler,2013-06-09 19:26:00,8605,"Flowing unimpeded for 748 kilometers from it's headwaters at Lansdowne House to James Bay, the Attawapiskat River is a powerful watery highway of epic proportions.  Upstream at Beteau lake where I've fished before it's much more intimate in nature with many more slack water areas and a more benign nature. Once the north channel of the river merges with the mainstem they combine and flow east towards James Bay. Numerous small feeder rivers add to the volume and the river becomes imposing. It's strength is deceiving, it truly is big water. The only other river I've ever fished that's comparable is the Kenai in Alaska.  Hearst Air's outpost at Pym Island on the mainstem is well known for its fantastic fishery. What few if anyone knows is Hearst Air has another outpost camp located 40 odd kilometers downstream from Pym. It was formerly private camp that they just recently aquired. Not open to the general public yet my group was the fortunate first to fish it.  The entire trip was arranged at virtually the last second so the camp wasn't really ready for guests yet. However Hearst Air delivered two 20' freighter canoes, motors and plenty of gas on short notice and really, what else matters?  Joining me on the trip was my friend and boat partner Aaron Shirley as well as Doug Orton from the board and his friend and cameraman Kevin.  Would we be able to find the fish in this water so vastly different from what I was used to? What effect would the late spring have? The water was cold, turbid, and flowing 6 feet higher than normal.  Time would tell...    The morning we flew in was picture perfect, clear blue skies and a light breeze from the north. Loading the Otter at Hearst Air's dock our anticipation was running high.     Once in the air the terrain north of hearst quickly transformed. Sparse trees dissapeared and we were left with boggy muskeg interspersed with small pothole lakes. It's desolate yet hauntingly beautiful and never ceases to inspire.      The sight of ice still clinging to the shores of the lakes was testament to just how early in the season it was.     As we circled the camp it was obvious the river was in flood stage, our pilot being forced to avoid the numerous amount of logs and debris floaing downstream. Landing safely we taxiied up to the camp carefully.  There was no dock in place yet so we backed the plane in. I had to jump off the pontoon at one point into the icy water to grab a rope as the wind and current was pulling the plane away. We got 'er done though.  First sight of the camp set high on a bluff overlooking the river was awesome.     We quickly unpacked and with help from the pilot got the propane fridge running and the camp into some semblance of order. Such a pretty spot! I snapped this quick pic from the deck overlooking the river.     In short order we said our goodbyes to the pilot and he was off leaving us alone in the wilderness.    The location of the camp was chosen wisely. Right beside camp there's a substantial inflowing river that's unnamed on the topo map. Hearst Air calls it Canada Creek and it's eaily navigable 2km's upstream to a small shallow lake.  It was expected that this feeder creek and lake would provide excellent fishing for obvious reasons as it was substantially warmer than the main river and once the boats were set up that was the first water we tackled. Although we did catch fish, a few small walleyes and hammerhandle pike, shockingly the big girls were nowhere to be found.  Perusing the top map we made a decision to run upstream to a small island cluster. Fishing the slack water behind it Aaron struck paydirt first with a chunky pike.      Shortly afterwards continuing on upstream we found a motherlode of larger walleyes hanging out at the mouth of a small inflowing creek. Aaron did most of the damage with a black/silver Husky Jerk.              We caught scads of fish in this spot, a bunch in the high 20's, truly impressive walleye. Still, we had more water to explore and we pushed un upstream. Several kilometers further upstream a mild rapids with two small islands in the middle of the river looked promising.      Surprisingly beyond a few dink walleye this spot did not produce. It was a head scratcher to say the least and left us scrambling to figure out a consistent pattern.  The next four days we were blessed with perfect weather. Warm sun, no bugs, and little to no wind. We took advantage and explored much of the river both upstream and down from camp pushing the boundaries further and further each day.  Aaron constructed a most awesome paddle/push pole for our boat and here he plays guide, paddling me into a prime spot where a huge beaver dam blocked a small creek entering the main river.     One smaller but chunky pike was the result. More impressive though was the beaver dam. It was a Beaver's version of the Hyatt Regency.      As stated the river was in flood stage and because of that we were able to effectively eliminate 90% of the water.  Current breaks were key, slack water behind islands and anywhere a small creek flowed in. Best of all was an island cluster with a creek flowing in behind it, a double barrelled combination that occured several times and proved to be dynamite.  Finally we were starting to put the pieces of the puzzle together. Best of all these fish were actively hitting hardware when we did find them. Inline bucktails, spinnerbaits, spoons, they all worked. Occasionally we'd toss a smaller plastic as either a follow up bait or for a change of pace and they worked too.  Best plastic was a 6"" white twister tail rigged on a light swimbait head. It was more or less the equivolent of an after dinner mint and the fish couldn't refuse.    We entered a small brushy feeder creek at one point and managed a bunch of mid sized pike. Every little pool, turn and bend coughed up at least one fish...            Heading further downstream the beauty of the river was incredible. In this clip you'll note two things. One, Aaron never sits still. When he's not on the tiller he's constantly tinkering with his tackle. And two, you can clearly see the huge blocks of ice still lining the river banks in spots.      We caught fish consistently in every prime spot we fished.                                Mid week we had a huge fish fry thanks to Aaron. What many of you don't know, the man has developed his own coating mix that is fantastic. The fact that he wouldn't give me the recipe speaks volumes.         We also managed to get the dock put in before dinner and were treated to a spectacular sunset for our efforts.       Fortunately we had a sat phone with us and were able to get up to date weather forecasts. On what was to be our last good weather day Aaron and I made a decision to push the boundaries even further.  Looking at the map there was a particularly enticing island cluster a good 45km's downstream (that's a 90km round trip). Would it procuce? Honestly we didn't care that much as the sheer adventure of exploring this vast hinterland was motivation enough.  Loading the boat with an extra motor and gas we pushed off downstream. Pretty much every grade A spot we stopped at produced fish.                                                                                        Here a mid sized pike dropped into the bottom of the boat (accident) and proceeded to clamp onto the butt of my rod and chew it to bits. They were savage!            On the way down to this glory hole we navigated through a kilometer long section of rolling rapids. Basking in the warm late afternoon sun and back in shorts and t shirts we shot this clip of our ascent.      The boat plastered in fish slime, our hands cut and bloodied we made our way back to camp.What a day!  Believe it or not I only posted a fraction of what we caught that day. It was maybe the best day of pike fishing I've ever experienced.  Back at camp that night we all hit the sack early. Kevin is one of those fortunate people with the ability to fall asleep within seconds of lying down. He's also one of the noisiest.   As the rest of us lay there listening to him drone on oblivious to our misery in a contented stupor, I shot this short video clip.     The balance of the week the weather truly did turn for the worse. High's of 6 degrees, wind, rain and even snow at times. Still we persevered and caught fish.                           On our way back upstream we pulled into a channel between two islands, one that hadn't produced a thing in our earlier attemps. Just like that the fish were on and we got into a few.                On our last day Aaron and I fished on completely oblivious of time. Despite the nasty weather we'd continued to catch fish. I looked at my watch and was shocked to realize it was 9:20pm. We'd both figured it was 7-7:30 tops.  Still facing a 11/2 hour boat ride back upstream to reach camp we finally packed it in. We were done.  Pulling up to the dock at 10:45 Doug stood waiting for us.  ""So, you made it back alive, I was starting to get worried!"", ""I'm guessing you guys beat the fish up pretty good?""  Yep, no doubt about it!     For those who are interested I shot a short video tour of the camp.As mentioned Heast just aquired it as it was previously a privately owned camp. Great, great facility and once it's truly prepped for guests it will be spectacular.      A big thanks to Melanie Veilleux of Hearst Air. She was a true pleasure to deal with and was instrumental in making this trip happen for us at the very last minute. Thank's Mel, you're the best!  http://hearstair.wordpress.com/  Finally a big thanks to my friends who joined me on this adventure, you guys were great. I'd spend a week in the bush with any of you again.  A special thanks to my boat mate Aaron. My friend you were a joy to fish with. It's rare that I fish with someone who's on exactly the same wavelength as myself. You fish hard and you know your stuff. Thanks for making the trip truly exceptional for me!   Hope you all enjoyed,    Cheers, Mike "

791516,Joey,2013-06-09 23:10:00,9122,"Okay, I see them now.  WOW, that a report Mike.  Well done!!!"
791520,adempsey,2013-06-09 23:25:00,1498,Great report!   Thanks for putting it all together.   The videos are always nice addition and the photos are amazing.  Definitely a fishing paradise.
791539,solopaddler,2013-06-10 00:17:00,8605,"It was pretty frustrating let me tell you when I thought I had this posted then the links failed. I edited something then when I submitted the edited post everything was fubar. I had to delete every single link one by one and reinsert good ones from photobucket and youtube. An extra 2 hours easy.  Anyhow glad you guys enjoyed,   Cheers"
791540,Musky or Specks,2013-06-10 00:18:00,2710,So much Pike slime. Very nice report Mike. Thats not snoring LOL wait till you get a chance to camp with me. I've had whole camps ask me to take my tent and move further into the bush.

I'll take some Attawapiskat well done with a side of awesome any day.  Hope Doug feeds us some more too.   Eddies, creeks and islands... ohhhhh pike and eye drive-thrus."
791560,Aaron Shirley,2013-06-10 01:39:00,655,"Great write-up Mike! Excellent photos as well.  Thank you for putting this all together, it was an awesome trip of a lifetime to say the least.  It was an absolute pleasure to fish with you as well. It isn't often you get to fish so hard for a week with a like-minded person and enjoy each other's company so much.  You told the story very well with such a great variety of the photos. I think the OFC server would crash if you posted all of them lol"
791571,solopaddler,2013-06-10 02:18:00,8605,"Hey no problem Brad, that's what earplugs are for. As far as Kevin goes I was 30' away when when I shot that clip. Did you turn up the volume? The man was a human power auger LOL!  You SHOULD have been with us on this trip Bunk. Next year can't come soon enough!   Thanks bud and yes I had 550 photos on my camera alone. I posted none of yours or Doug and Kevins either.  Hopefully Doug chimes in with a few photos of his own."
