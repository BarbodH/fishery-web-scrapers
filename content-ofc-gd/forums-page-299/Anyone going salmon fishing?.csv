I recently finished law school and it's quite frankly too expensive for me to charter a boat with all my debts.  My girlfriend tried to charter a boat last year as a valentines day gift but the operator had to cancel last minute since his boat broke down for the season.  So, I was wondering if anyone here is planning on going salmon fishing in the near future and would have a seat open for me.  I'm easy to get along with an would be happy to pitch in for supplies (i.e. perhaps for gas or lunch).  Best, bahram"
