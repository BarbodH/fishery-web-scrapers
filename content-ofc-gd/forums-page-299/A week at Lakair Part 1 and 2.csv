The host complimented her on her photos and said "" I really like your photos, you must have a great camera. The photographer did not reply. But smiled. When leaving, the photographer commented to his host, "" great meal! You must have an exceptional stove""! No comment was heard from the host."

Unfortunately, I'll be doing this trip solo as Patsy doesn't get as much vacation time.  (Just not gonna be the same this time     ) With all the muskies I'm gonna get - that should be interesting  (guess no pics this time - ya'all will just have to trust me)  We gotta say hi and share a couple stories (or lies - whichever it happens to be).

Yes Roy, I'm counting the days.  Tell J to bring the fixins for that smoked salmon/avacado thingy she makes.  I'll even buy the salmon and avacado if you want!!!!!"
794000,Joey,2013-06-22 22:19:00,9122,"Paul and I just spent a week at Lakair, joined by Rich and Patsy.  We had a wonderful time and although the weather was not the greatest, it was better than being too hot in the boat all day.  We had rain, winds and even a tornado warning on Sunday.  We survived though and just got a good, long thunderstorm instead.  Although the dark, low swirling clouds were a bit ominous.  We arrived Saturday to nice weather but a bit cool for June.  Sunday was rainy and a bit muggy so we just puttered around and fished for pickerel in the morning, of which we caught none.  We could not fish the afternoon due to the tornado warning and thunderstorms.  Monday was windy and cool, but good with Paul catching 9 pike and I caught 12 pike and a nice 36"" musky.  Nice way to start the week    We had a nice fish fry with Rich and Patsy that night, that was delicious.   Tuesday was pike day again, with Paul catching 2 and me catching 5.  Wednesday more pike, Paul 4, me 6  Thursday was the windiest day of any of them all.  I got 5 pike, 1 pickerel, 1 perch and had a musky on, but lost it boatside, then had another musky follow.  Paul got a 38"" musky, 7 pike, 1 pickerel, 1 perch and a teeny, tiny LMB.  His musky was very beat up and had many cuts and gashes all over.  One big round hole on the other side that does not show.                Friday was our last day and we hit the water hard for a larger musky, but were denied.  We ended up with Paul getting 5 pike and a nice 19"" OOS Smallie (By one day) and I got 4 pike.  Paul also saw a bear, which was booking it up a rock and I missed it he was running so fast.  Rich and Patsy left before us this morning and we headed out about noon.  We tried to wait for Lew and Diane but they had not arrived by the time we were ready to go  Saw some awesome wildlife and took some pics for you all to enjoy.  So here they are in no particular order.   LOONS               HERONS              SNAKES                     MINK                     Part 2 to follow......"

Love that first Osprey shot wide eyed and mouth open - just like he is ready to give you a piece of his mind. I see you did post the one pic of the Osprey doing his business. See ya both soon.
794013,danc,2013-06-22 23:02:00,4677,"Wow Joey. Nice report, but the pics are amazing! When you put your mind to taking up a new hobby, you don't fool around."

794017,Joey,2013-06-22 23:15:00,9122,"Thanks guys.  Paul and Rich were giving me a hard time, ribbing me about my bird photography, saying I was obsessed     they kept going ""BIRD""!!!  But I'm happy with the results and also of finding them and then trying to figure out what some of them were!"
794018,woodenboater,2013-06-22 23:23:00,2277,great photos Joey ! didja get a new telephoto lens ?
794022,Rich Clemens,2013-06-22 23:37:00,3131,I really think Canadian Geographic should publish a lot of your photos - quite a few of these are just that good.
794023,chris.brock,2013-06-22 23:55:00,4053,"nice muskies,  you take great pictures, I miss my boston terrier,"
794024,Muskieman,2013-06-22 23:59:00,2472,Great report! Awesome pics!

794028,ccmtcanada,2013-06-23 00:36:00,7971,Excellent report Joey and spectacular pics as usual!   That's a great Muskie!!
794030,Joey,2013-06-23 00:40:00,9122,"Woodenboater, the lens is not new, but the camera is and I've been taking my photography a bit more seriously lately.  Thanks  Thanks Rich  Chris, he's a French Bulldog, but they do look very similar.  I almost got a Boston actually, it was a toss up.  Sinker, that would be fun !!!  Thanks everyone, much appreciated."
794035,Lunatic,2013-06-23 00:56:00,536,awesome.the wife and i are going to be at lakair for a few days at the end of july. im pumped. my inbox accepts tips on pike and muskie locations lol
794038,Fisherpete,2013-06-23 01:04:00,1814,Great report and even better pics! Did you get the muskie on one of your new lures?
794041,glen,2013-06-23 01:11:00,2641,Great report thanks.
794049,Joey,2013-06-23 01:23:00,9122," What dates?  We'll be back up again in July aswell!!    No, I was very disappointed in the components.  I bought them from a Canadian lure making company, and they had ""new"" S shaped stirrup clevises so you didn't have to use two, only one component, and they broke right off and tossed the blades with them.  I will be having a word with them and requesting some kind of refund for all the work and wasted components.  So, anyone buying any musky lure components, do NOT get the S shaped stirrup clevises that are now available."
794060,beerman,2013-06-23 02:00:00,118,"I must say, I read ALL reports, etc..... These are some of the MOST incredible pictures I have seen... Great job! Love it!!"
794063,NAW,2013-06-23 02:03:00,4022,Incredible shots Capn'!
794064,Musky or Specks,2013-06-23 02:04:00,2710,Thanks for the report and I really enjoyed the wildlife pics. Minks are so cute till you get one in your fishing net and they go ballistic and spray everywhere... Don't ask.
