I've come across a little problem that I was hoping someone on here could clarify for me...  I just purchased a 3 bank battery charger from Canadian Tire. (it was on sale ) as my 2 bank pooched a couple weeks ago.. Install seemed easy enough but now to program the charger for each battery, it's asking what type do I have ?? AGM, GEL or Flooded Type ????     I don't see anything on the batteries ?  Cranking battery and 2 deep cycle....  They are all maintenance free is all I know.... These were in the boat when I bought it so I'm kinda stuck...  Will the charger work differently if I have the wrong battery type programmed in there ?????  Any help will be gladly appreciated ??  Thanks Tiz"

If they are the expensive ones most likely AGM or possibly Gel. Do they have caps you can remove? either 6 that unscrew or 2 bigger rectangular ones that can be popped off with a screwdriver? Pop them off and look inside. See liquid acid? They be flooded.
794215,tizfun,2013-06-23 21:56:00,292,Thanks Drifter....  They are the cheaper.. Napa batteries....Cranking battery is completely closed... 2 deep cycle have the rectangular caps exposing 3 cells when I pop them off.. looks like water in there...  Thank you so much....  back out to the garage to get it up and running....

794269,DRIFTER_016,2013-06-24 00:35:00,10439,Have had mine for 3 years so far. Works great and is made for CT by Schumacher Electric.  http://www.batterychargers.com/  This is actually the charger that is re-branded with the Nautilus name on it.  http://www.batterychargers.com/ProductDetail.aspx?ProductName=94026916  Can't go wrong as the both models come with a 5 year warranty.
