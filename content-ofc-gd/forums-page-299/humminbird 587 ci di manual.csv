794230,Lunatic,2013-06-23 23:02:00,536,oops theres no ci. just di
794232,Lunatic,2013-06-23 23:03:00,536,i did a quick check earlier and didnt see anything
794288,Lape0019,2013-06-24 01:45:00,647,"The install is straight forward but what issues do your foresee having? I just installed a 561 on the bow of my boat and a 788 on my dads console. If I remember correctly, I pre drilled 4 holes for the base mount on the dash and now and 2 holes for the transducer in my dads. I think one would do on the transducer but I would prefer not to mess with their recommendations."
794317,BillM,2013-06-24 03:29:00,17367,You really don't need installation instructions..  Can't mess up any of the wires because the ends are all different and only fit one way in the locking mechanism that installs into the base..  Super simple.

794615,Lunatic,2013-06-25 03:26:00,536,"its the brackets for the transducer, the top peice has the average 2 screws then theres a 3rd screw for the bracket thats apart of the transducer that requires one screw. by usuing that one screw that whole other peice seems useless"
794621,BillM,2013-06-25 03:39:00,17367,"Do you have the proper kit to install the transducer?  After looking at the Humminbird website, it looks like you need MHX XNT.  http://ca.humminbird.com/products/460925?product_id=e76c174b6c9a0ca4df401e63f9b47865"
794655,mcdougy,2013-06-25 11:19:00,274,"The third hole is to be used if you want to LOCK your transducer down and not have the capabality to allow it to free float while loading or driving.  I have the 597 model and will check the box for the install instructions, as I just installed it this spring.  Checked and I do have install booklet"
794785,Lunatic,2013-06-26 00:04:00,536,yep thats the bracket i have.  am i supposed to have just the one transducer? i bought a display model so just want to make sure i got everything.ive only ever owned one finder before this  and it was very basic and no DI
