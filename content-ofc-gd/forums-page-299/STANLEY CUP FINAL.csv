792826,leaf4,2013-06-16 16:04:00,2466,"That was chicagos game in regulation had that goal not been disallowed, I think the integrity of the reffing this season is dwindling with quotes like this ""He said his intention was to blow the whistle""  So without blowing the whistle the play can be called dead? just like the game 7 disallowed goal on Chicago again against the Red Wings. Luckily Seabrook saved them."
794616,asdve23rveavwa,2013-06-25 03:33:00,2690,"Chicago in six as predicted, lol, for my prize I choose a fly in to any of Mike's awesome destinations.  Seriously, great final between two teams with an amazing amount of grit!"
794622,BillM,2013-06-25 03:43:00,17367,Boston just had a piece of the humble pie.  Crazy finish.
794631,Freshtrax,2013-06-25 04:43:00,2215,"""It's everything every kid in Canada thinks it is and More"" way to go Hawks...and as much as it pains me to say it good run Boston... but if I ever spot Marchand or Lucic in a bar I will punch you."
794657,Rod Caster,2013-06-25 11:29:00,5784,"Kane as MVP??? As they nuts?? It was Bickell or Toews or Crawford before Kane, and Rask or bergeron before Kane. What a bad pick for Conn Smythe."
794667,BillM,2013-06-25 13:06:00,17367,Kane for MVP was just stupid.. Should have given it to the kid from Orono.
794723,blaque,2013-06-25 16:37:00,2419," Only accolades he should have received, was MDB (most disgusting beard)...........that thing was repulsive"

792308,asdve23rveavwa,2013-06-12 22:29:00,2690,"Chicago in six, but, Boston keeps surprising me Brian."
792309,davey buoy,2013-06-12 22:32:00,5505,I still like Pittsburg and LA !!!  .Boston in 6 here!!
792310,muskymatt,2013-06-12 22:33:00,2608,Chicago in overtime game 6. Hossa scores. Amazing how many ex Sens players are in the finals
792311,GBW,2013-06-12 22:37:00,8460,only because Hud posted a pic of him wearing a Hawks jersey while he stood with the CUP I'll say Hawks to support him.  That and the Leafs were the only team to test Boston so this should be easy for the Hawks to win.
792313,misfish,2013-06-12 22:47:00,29133,"  I,ll bet, everyone of them, are glad they were traded."
792314,misfish,2013-06-12 22:48:00,29133,"  I keep thinking,what if the leafs did put them out,would it be them here?"

792318,asdve23rveavwa,2013-06-12 23:13:00,2690,"Could they have beaten the Rangers...definitely.Pittsburgh, I don't think so."
792321,danc,2013-06-12 23:39:00,4677,B Hawks in 7.
792338,tender52,2013-06-13 02:33:00,270,Both teams have been together for about 3 yrs now. Boston brought in more players...... Chicago in 5
792341,John Bacon,2013-06-13 02:55:00,3277,Boston in 6.
792361,Cudz,2013-06-13 05:25:00,2652,That was a good game.  I like both these teams
792389,blaque,2013-06-13 12:17:00,2419,"That was pretty entertaining indeed. However, i found it less entertaining when the alarm went off at 5:30AM this morning"
792516,Believer,2013-06-14 02:00:00,40,Boston in 6. Chicago with the goaltending breakdown
792525,SirCranksalot,2013-06-14 02:34:00,3291,"What, into the finals already and it's only mid-June!!!"

792733,danc,2013-06-16 00:55:00,4677,"They do. Liking it so far, but too early to see where the games is gonna go. I'm sure the Bruins will wake up sooner or later."
792734,davey buoy,2013-06-16 00:57:00,5505,"Won't last I'm sure,but what a start!!"
792735,danc,2013-06-16 00:58:00,4677, Go to bed Brian. Big day for you tomorrow. Jr. is at his best track. Funny thing is that I drew Jr. in my pool this weekend. So I will be pulling for him too.
