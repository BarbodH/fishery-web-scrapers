794318,Freshtrax,2013-06-24 03:29:00,2215,"Found a bit of time to give lakers a go on simcoe this afternoon.   we launced out of oro around 3  and shot across to the south shore of Kempenfelt.     We setup pulling big spoons on 2 oz three way rigs in 100fow  with 250 ft of line out.   not ten min. in a rod goes off.    I thought i was going to land my first softwater laker on simcoe....  thing was it wasen't fighing like a laker......halfway to the boat the fish got mixed up in the other line had to sort it out still had the fish on somehow.....get the fish near the boat  and realize we dont have the net. great.... Angela reaches over to grab the fish and all i hear is ""HE HAS TEEEEETTTHHH""   I give her the rod and grab the fish and the hook pops right out. I have no clue how we managed to get it in the boat......enough with the suspence here it is......weird i know.....    it was a long fight with all the crazyness i wanted to get it back in the water asap so there pretty crummy pics but my biggest pickereleye to date...no tape measure no team sign  had a blast out there today no lakers but this one fish made it all worth it.  she went back to swim another day    i know the pattern for these guys in the fall but this about blew my mind.

794325,Cudz,2013-06-24 03:54:00,2652,There are no walleye in Simcoe (actually there are no small walleye in Simcoe)
794333,Terry,2013-06-24 08:46:00,14456,nice going
794344,fishindevil,2013-06-24 10:24:00,6254,Kudos on the fish and on the release !!!!  As said above there are huge walleyes in simcoe just far and few between !!!!! Congrats on your pb !!!!
794348,ehg,2013-06-24 10:53:00,2666,Nice walleye!  Back 15-20 yrs. ago they were easy targets around Beaverton through ice until they closed season early. My PB of 16 lbs. came from there.Saw 20 lbers come from there and swore must be world record swimming in Simcoe.
794385,NAW,2013-06-24 14:10:00,4022,It sure is nice to see the odd Simcoe hog!  Thanks for sharing!
794390,Joey,2013-06-24 14:25:00,9122,"Wow, nice pickerel and a nice surprise for sure!!!"
794403,mike rousseau,2013-06-24 15:12:00,4661,Neat....  It's cool to get a rare fish....  Nice catch
794407,mattyk,2013-06-24 15:14:00,2110,Nice eye!
794522,krixxer,2013-06-24 22:43:00,274,I can't catch walleye where there are Walleye but you managed to find that on Simcoe!  i need to get my Walleye game up
794528,kickingfrog,2013-06-24 22:54:00,8333,All those fish in the Talbot River have to go someplace. Nice 'eye.
794614,TJQ,2013-06-25 03:25:00,7806,Good for ya for putting 'er back!
794628,Freshtrax,2013-06-25 04:07:00,2215,"hey if we had been on the french or in the kawarthas i would have had no problem with a fish fry......i just diddnt have  the heart.   just curious for the serious walleye fishermen out there im pretty shure she was every bit of 28- 30 inches ( i am 6'4"")  what would a fish like that weigh?    my bighest was 26 inches and weighed 7 pounds."
794629,BillM,2013-06-25 04:12:00,17367,That looks like a mid to high 20inch fish for sure... 5-6lbs?
794630,Freshtrax,2013-06-25 04:30:00,2215,
794659,ehg,2013-06-25 11:33:00,2666,Simcoe walleyes are FOOTBALL walleyes. My guess is 8 lbs or a little more.
794665,Dave Bailey,2013-06-25 12:55:00,1641," Okay, that pic, with that caption right below it, is actually rather funny. Or maybe I just have a weird sense of humour."
794694,Freshtrax,2013-06-25 15:09:00,2215, Lol I thought about it after I posted it......I was talking about simcoe walleye lol
