794039,DRIFTER_016,2013-06-23 01:08:00,10439,Answer? Fresh Great Slave Lake laker!!!  Got out on the big lake yesterday on our Aboriginal Day holiday for the first time this year. It was a horrible day with no wind and a hot sun.      It was nice and quiet for a holiday. Got to see a few eagles while out which was nice. There was a nesting pair hiding in these trees.    And another adult male here.    Took quite a while to find the fish but I did eventually find them.      Productive depth was 15 feet and a local spoon called a Wolverine spoon was the ticket.    Now the result of a little work. Lake trout with my secret blend of herbs and spices smothered in cheese sauce. Cooked in tin foil on the BBQ. Later this week I'm heading to the East Arm to slam trout and will be cooking this over an open fire.    The new 4 stroke seems to be working good at catching fish.

794052,DRIFTER_016,2013-06-23 01:36:00,10439,Not a small tackle company. They are made by Gibbs but were designed by a local guy. They are only available here. You can't even find info on the internet on them.    The original guy that made them sold them out of his tackle store (Wolverine Sports) here in YK. A few years ago they closed the doors and the local Canadian Tire bought the patent and sells them now. As far as I know this is the only place that you can get them.
794053,chris.brock,2013-06-23 01:43:00,4053,"cool, pretty unique shape, almost like a dodger, I bet they thump pretty good at the right speed"
794057,DRIFTER_016,2013-06-23 01:54:00,10439,They thump really good. Work well from about 2 to 2.5 MPH.
794061,chris.brock,2013-06-23 02:00:00,4053,"I like how you have 8 of them in the package, upon request, tackle junkie, Haha, very cool"
794072,DRIFTER_016,2013-06-23 02:29:00,10439,That was a batch I bought and mailed to Bill Maranza. I took a picture before I shipped them to him.
794073,Joey,2013-06-23 02:33:00,9122,Very nice!!

794251,troutologist,2013-06-24 00:01:00,951,They almost didnt let me on a first air flight because I refused to leave the wolverines behind....had to take the hooks off of 20 spoons at security.  Good luck on the east arm Dave. Heard some better fish are coming from around Lutsel K'e this week as the water is warmng up. They caught em in back bay with sand bottoms.
794253,danc,2013-06-24 00:04:00,4677,The days are getting shorter now Dave. Isn't it time to winterize that new motor?
794261,dhickey,2013-06-24 00:23:00,1038,Or tune up the sled? And get ready for winter?  Ya I just wish I lived up there.. Nice fish. Well done.

794409,Rod Caster,2013-06-24 15:25:00,5784,Nice! Losing weight and eating awesome dinners like that? You found a winning diet!!
794411,BillM,2013-06-24 15:34:00,17367," Dave gets credit for every monster laker I catch on one of these things, lol!!!!!"
794449,DRIFTER_016,2013-06-24 17:51:00,10439, That's the way it should be. When you heading to Nipigon?
