794594,Burtess,2013-06-25 02:28:00,901,"Spent last week up at Beaverland Camp in Marten River with a great bunch of guys. All 14 of us were accommodated in cabin #14 which has 4 bedrooms with two sets of bunks in each.  It was my first time up with this bunch (some have been coming up together for decades) and I am proud to say I was voted back in for next year!  Fishing was decent, with the most / largest fish coming from Bruce Lake (access to McPhee was restricted due to a large beaver dam).  Lots of smaller walleye just under the slot (16.9 - 23.6"") made for a couple of awesome fish frys.  Most of the smaller ones came on a whole nightcrawler while drifting.  The large ones on plastic (love those Powerbait Rippletails in white!!) Caught quite a few pike on soft swimbaits too, nothing too big but good for the fish fry. Bass opened up on the last fishing day so we got into a few of them too.  Here are some pics:         Spotted some young moose crossing Bruce Lake, man can they ever move:     One just at top end of the slot:   Just over the slot at 24 1/4"" :   A respectable bass from Saturday:   Burt"
