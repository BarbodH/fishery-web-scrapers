794460,OhioFisherman,2013-06-24 18:37:00,6623,"I wandered across that video, the problems with those species are pretty well publicized in some rivers, I had no idea that they were also in Kentucky and Barkley lakes.  40 tons of carp in two days, two semi loads, it gives a better idea of the scope of the problem they present?   "

794663,Mike Pike,2013-06-25 12:34:00,1332,"Wow, I actually wasn't aware that Asian Carp were brought in on purpose to control water quality in aquaculture farms.  Nobody thought this would be a bad idea???????"
794673,dks,2013-06-25 13:23:00,36,Great video on cooking the Asian Carp. It's no surprise they taste good since they are raised in the east for food. Well done filleting technique too. I watched another video a couple of years ago and it made the filleting process tedious! I believe they are marketing Asian carp as Silverfin fish?
