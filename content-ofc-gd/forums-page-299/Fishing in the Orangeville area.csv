I've been to lake eugenia, waldemar fishing the grand river and the Orangeville reservoir. I am wondering if you guys know any areas around Orangeville ( 1-1.5 hour drive ) that I could try for some bigger more exciting fish. I dont own a boat so shore fishing is my only option unfortunately.  Thanks for the help in advance."

Along with good Bass fishing plenty of 4 plus pound largies catch and release only on the largies. You will need a small boat to get to the better spots on the res, there are rental boats available. Lots of good trout fishing in the area as well sorry can't go into details on the area trout on the forum as the trout guys here are liable to blow a gasket. Google and a little research will give you a headstart."
