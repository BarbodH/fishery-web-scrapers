We have a great time most years with lots of willing fish and never really run into other anglers.  The late spring and high water(plus thunderstorms off and on) really put the fish down. Water was a high and relatively dirty.  He managed 5 ""keepers"" of 12"" or better while I got only one. I probably won't hear the end of it all weekend.  Heres his best fish a 19""       A short video of landing it in the pouring rain     A couple of fawns came down to check out his bass fishing prowess.   All fish were caught on Watermelon Yamamoto flappin hogs that were split shot rigged."
