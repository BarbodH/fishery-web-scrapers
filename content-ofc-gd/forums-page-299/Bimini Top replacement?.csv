I have the original bimini top rails which seem ok but the tarp is becoming ripped and frail.  Originally thought since I had a ""template"" I could buy the material (Sunbrella seems highly rated) and have a relative sew it up for me.  Then noticed on ebay some units for under $200 but shipping costs are questionable.  Phoned up a local merchant in Fenelon Falls which was very nice and accommodating but gave a ballpark est. at $500 -$700. The woman also remarked that the old tarp wouldn't be of great help and I'd need to bring boat in for measurements.  My fixer upper pontoon boat is only 16' with the bimini probably 6-8' long and approx 7' wide.  Of course getting it done by the pros would be ideal but the wallet is a little on the thin side just getting the boat in the water!   Probably head downtown Hamilton Ottawa street where I bought my boat seat vinyl and see what is available but any suggestion are more than welcome.  "
