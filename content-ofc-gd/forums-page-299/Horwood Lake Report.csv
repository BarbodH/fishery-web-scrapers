Headed out to Horwood lake all day Saturday, and did well. 3 largest Walleyes were 31 inches 10.5 lbs, 30 inch 10 lb, and a 28 inch 8 lb. along with those we caught many in the mid-low 20 range and plenty of eaters (16-18 inchers) Here are a few photos from the day. Starting off with my stringer going down to the bigger and bigger ones of the day ending off with the 31 inch beast. My partner had an awesome day too with lots of size as well. Enjoy! "

Has a 25 4 stroke on it now, with ipilot installed on the bowmount, threw my elite 5 dsi on the bow attached to the trolling motor and put a humminbird 598 with side imaging back at the tiller. Did the fish finder adjustments the day after these were taken actually"
