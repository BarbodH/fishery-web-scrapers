1059698,Dutch01,2020-04-13 20:49:00,1431,You can stand and fish all day long on the right kayak. Hell you could dance with a girl on a Hobie PA

1059766,BillM,2020-04-14 17:22:00,17367,I'd say the same thing about fishing in a kayak

Some of these rules are ridiculous, and that is one that i am really sour about. I drove around checking things out yesterday for 3 hours. Not one boat launch accessible to get a boat in the water, however, the 6 kayakers fishing out there are ok? Stupid. These guys are a lot more risk than a guy in a very seaworthy, and stable boat. Not to mention they were all together in a group, and used the same launch I would have used with my boat. I'm sure they all sat around and shot some bull afterwards, and most likely helped each other load their crafts at the end of the day. Whats safer and better for the community?  That, or me taking my wife and kids for a boat ride and maybe catch a couple fish for dinner? And just so you all don't start with the travel thing, and stopping for gas, and coffees and all the rest of that stuff.....I live 15 mins from 8 different boat ramps. I am an essential worker who has to drive to work every day, and keep gas in my truck regardless. Stopping for coffees and take out is the last thing I want to do in these times. I can make better coffee at home and my cupboards are full of great food. I am very aware of whats going on, and diligent in my own safety, and more so the safety of others. S. "

1060318,Henricus,2020-04-20 03:28:00,118,"I have owned my Hobie PA14 since Aug 2014.  It  wasn’t cheap as far as kayaks are concerned but the maintenance cost over 5 years has totaled $12 so far.  No gas, no licensing, no winterizing, no insurance, no maintenance, no anything.  I have owned a fiberglass fishing boat for many years.  It barely moves now (almost sold it but I just can’t seem to part with it).  I enjoy the exercise and find myself more relaxed when fishing from the yak.  I can very easily stand to fish and the seat is comfortable enough that 7-10 hr days are common.  I also used to regularly fish from a canoe...used to.  If offered the chance I wouldn’t turn down fishing from any vessel but given the choice the kayak wins more often than not.  Good luck with the draw.  If you win you will never look back."

It just sat and collected dust once I fell for kayak fishing. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ It's one of those things, you either love it or you don't like it. Those that love it are almost all die-hards, there's got to be a reason for that right? For me, it was about slowing down, simplifying, and focusing on the experience. It's also a lifestyle. I don't just fish from it, I do paddle (now pedal) in camping trips too. It's also great exercise. I lost 55 pounds in the last few years.  I made other major lifestyle changes so kayaking doesn't get all the credit but paddling is fantastic for your core."
1059657,gordy28,2020-04-13 14:51:00,638,"I am being lazy and not going all the way back and reading every comment but as a new kayak owner here is my perspective I bought a kayak at the end of the summer.  I have access to cottages with nice boats but work, life, family etc allows me to get there 2 or 3 times a summer and I was not getting my fill of fishing,  Enter the kayak I love it - to date I have spent about $1200 on the package including a way to load it in my pick up (5.5 box) It has allowed me to spend some time fishing locally, do some day trips and I will most likely bring it to cottages and camping whenever that happens again. I don't think it will replace boats or will be for everyone but I do believe it certain parts of the US and Canada it has really taken off - cheaper jump in point, better for accessing certain spots and for some a better connection to water/nature Cheers Gody "
1059662,SirCranksalot,2020-04-13 15:51:00,3291,Sort of agree---you can do things with a bass boat that I cannot do with my canoe by the converse also applies. Years ago I used to drool with envy with the fancy boats being towed on the highway---not any more.When my bud and I were hammering the fish on a back lake in my canoe that drooling stopped for good!
1059663,Dutch01,2020-04-13 15:56:00,1431,"My analogy isn't perfect either because a $500 pelican or $1000 Jackson Bite will put you on fish, so you don't have to spend big to kayak fish. The point was that's it's not about dollars at all for me. I have the very tool I want, for what I want to do. It happens to be expensive to some, I paid $2,600 lightly used, but I never considered the money."

I already have my rods and my Hummingbird Helix 5 so my added costs to rig it won't be crazy. Even if I don't win this one, I might rent one (when we can) and see if it's for me and if so buy this unit if it's stable seeing how I have vertigo issues every now and then... *edit to add* PS the raffle is only $40 a spot and there is only 37 spots to buy so wish me luck!"

I haven't paddled it but from what I understand is very stable. It's decently light too because it's thermoformed (most fishing kayaks are rotomolded). Pretty sure you can rent one from Freedom Kayak in Blackstock if you want to try one out."
1059676,Dutch01,2020-04-13 16:42:00,1431,"Definitely a FB thing. I'm not a gambler myself but these raffles are pretty popular, especially south of the border."

1059679,Dutch01,2020-04-13 17:02:00,1431,"A 12' thinner is loud compared to my kayak. -An electric motor is loud. -The boat itself is loud. -tin boats are not known for comfortable bench seats. My Hobie seat has built in adjustable lumbar support. -a tin boat uses gas or a heavy battery to recharge if using electric -a tin boat requires registration and insurance (might be covered under home policy depends on insurer) -requires a trailer and a spot to keep it. I keep my Hobie inside my apartment. -Kayak needs no launch and I don't have to pay for parking most of the time as most municipal lots that I know only charge if you have a trailer -sitting in a tin boat is not the same as sitting inches off the water. I have been through creeks 4"" deep to access back lakes  I'm not trying to make anyone sell their boat. I am not a fan of the misconception that people who kayak fish do so cause they can't afford a boat. I can't tell you how many times I hear ""why don't you just get a jon boat"".  I think that 12' jon boats suck, that's why! Lol (just an opinion not picking on anyone who has one!) I sold my boat cause the kayak is better (for me and what I want to be doing)."

There's better and often cheaper options for most situations. I get the draw of angling from a small craft but find kayaks impractical. Josh
1059481,Dutch01,2020-04-11 06:56:00,1431,"GBW don't listen to these guys kayak fishing is the teats!   (No disrespect guys 🙏) I'm not saying it's for everyone, but those who like it, love it. I'd also say it's not the next big thing, it's already here. There's a pretty big community of kayak anglers now, I always have someone to fish with if I'm not choosing to go solo. I have been kayak fishing for three years or so now. After the first year I sold my boat. I'm on my third 'yak, but the one I have now is finally ""the one"". You can go cheap or go high end, either will put you on fish and it really depends on your budget and where and how you're going to use it. It's always good to try before you buy if you can. Lots of shops have paddle days where you can show up and try a couple different demos but obviously none of that is going on right now due to covid. Check out Kawartha Kayak Fishing Club on Facebook. We have regular club meets. I can probably wrangle a spare kayak from a buddy for you to try out once we get the all clear on this virus."

1059486,singingdog,2020-04-11 12:06:00,1047,"""Next big thing""? 😆 Kayak fishing has been going strong for more than 10 years. Every imaginable species in pretty much every imaginable water has been caught from a yak. The only time I don't fish from a yak is when I fish from a SUP. Yes, you can lay out $2K for a yak, but you can also find a fishable boat for less than 1/2 that. Any stable SOT can be a good fishing yak. Specialized fishing yaks have evolved in design so that you can easily stand and fish easily. Closed boat ramps, meh. Expensive gas, meh. Lakes with no boat ramps, meh. Water too shallow for a motor......."
