1060002,misfish,2020-04-16 15:24:00,29133,Nice . How do tie the line to the clousers with no eye sticking out ? Have you used Faux Bucktail material ?
1060006,Gil Levesque,2020-04-16 15:55:00,103,"I dont use faux bucktail only the rea stuff!lol! Clouser has an eye! If u mean a tube fly, line goes in from front of tube and out the back. Tie on hook .push hook eye into silicone tube at rear of fly! When fish hits hook pulls out of the back of the fly.fly slides up line! No damage to fly! Lol!"
1060008,misfish,2020-04-16 16:06:00,29133,Ok thanks. Will have to look up tube fly now.LOL  Thanks again  B
