1058798,RangerGuy,2020-04-03 14:56:00,564,"I am dying to fish Erie, especially now that we are in Comp 205 Tiller! Guess it will have to wait till next year."
1058959,KraTToR,2020-04-04 23:01:00,506,"It is! I went out over a dozen times last season and limited out every trip, usually in 2 hours.¬† PM me if you want details."
1058980,OhioFisherman,2020-04-05 09:42:00,6623,"KraTTor, no details needed, thanks though for the offer. That's how it was years ago here, it did take a bit more than a couple of hours at times."
1058982,Fish Farmer,2020-04-05 13:11:00,2234,If I went home after 2-3 hours of fishing I wouldn't bother going. Fishing is a all day thing. I think I'd have to do ¬†the catch and release thing.üëçüòÅ
1058987,KraTToR,2020-04-05 13:49:00,506,"I must be feeling my age then..lol.¬† Started the season in Leamington (5 hr drive round trip), plus launch/load and cleaning 12 fish...¬† With 2 to 3 hours of pulling in wally's on 8/10 colour leadcore I was done.. Lets face it, this is not fun fishing, pulling in these things is like dragging an old boot.¬† But they are damn tasty and worth every bit of effort üòÑ "
1058997,OhioFisherman,2020-04-05 15:16:00,6623," Things must have changed over the years with the cleaner water? We just dragged a wiggle wart, hot n tot, or bandit 200 on 8 - 10 # mono."
1059011,Fish Farmer,2020-04-05 17:09:00,2234,"There's so many Walleye out there now you don't have to troll Just drift or jig for them with a spinning rod, so much more fun and you get your limit. May take you a little longer. Had a buddy out last year that hates trolling, I had to laugh¬†he was using his 13' noodle rod spinning reel drifting, his rod was bent right over almost double, Walleye on, fought it to the boat, was only 2 Lbs.üòÇ¬†He had a blast."
1059015,Terry,2020-04-05 17:48:00,14456,Dang. I‚Äôm gonna have to get down that way if this lockdown ever ends
1059040,OhioFisherman,2020-04-05 21:30:00,6623,"Fish, you really didn't have to troll years ago either, drift and cast an erie dearie or silver nuggets tip with a worm. I caught them casting lipless crankbaits and blade baits and others. Never a big fan of fishing on erie, it was almost always the closest water around with a high success rate."

1059216,Terry,2020-04-08 15:43:00,14456,"So, no one¬†has a photo of anyone not following social distancing in the water so they use a file photo ,which means an old photo In this Plain Dealer file photo"
1059229,OhioFisherman,2020-04-08 18:17:00,6623,"Missed that myself Terry, they have also closed the Maumee River which is a short drive west of there."
1059799,Lake Erie Bait and Tackle,2020-04-14 20:45:00,25,Can't wait to be able to get the boat out and go fishing again!
