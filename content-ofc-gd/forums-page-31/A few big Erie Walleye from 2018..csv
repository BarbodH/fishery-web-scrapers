Hopefully with all the therapy I've taken my back will hold up for a few trips out here on Erie and up north this year. Even number years are always my best years. So here are a few pics of my bigger Pics from 18'. That's me in the green shirt, 35 lbs lighter than a few years before and a few years younger than today. The ugly guy is our former Mayor of Hooterville On. Every time it was time to take his boat out he had a town council meeting to prepare for!!!! Cheap ^&*$%. . Wow I actually posted photos. A monster has been created.     "
1055593,Musky Plug,2020-01-24 21:16:00,398,Those are some hawgs! Erie is a great fishery. If you have back issues you should look into smooth moves for you chairs. They are pricey but a friend of mine has them that also has back issues and says they‚Äôve been great for his back.

1055600,chris.brock,2020-01-25 00:37:00,4053,Nicely done OI! and hopefully your back is on the mend
1055603,Old Ironmaker,2020-01-25 01:15:00,8243,"Too late for that. I stared on a few Bollywood blockbusters way back when I was young,fit and handsome. For the handsome part you would have to ask my lady, she thought so 27 years ago, so she says. For the young and fit part I came in 2nd in The Mr. Beansville Body Building competition. I was the only one entered."
1055606,AKRISONER,2020-01-25 02:02:00,5558,I‚Äôm stealing this lol i agree about the smooth moves chair. I don‚Äôt need one personally but have ran chop in one and they are niceeeee  those are some bloody big eyes
1055612,Old Ironmaker,2020-01-25 03:29:00,8243,"Feel free to use it Akrisoner. I have had a few laughs with it over the years and I actually didn't steal it. One of those seats would be nice out here. The price is up there starting at 500 bucks the last time I looked. A few of us old guys were talking about going to the truck and heavy equipment bone yard here and taking out one of the drivers seats that do the same thing. It ain't rocket science to install one. They are heavy yes but so are the seats they sell for boats. Charlie Wray that has the fishing show has one on his Crestliner and he advertises them. I sat in his at the marine dealer we both go to. It would be nice. Yep those are bigguns, 2 fillets will feed 4 hungry folks. Cheeks bigger than toonies. We all save the cheeks and have a cheek only feast the end of the year."

1055667,Musky Plug,2020-01-26 04:11:00,398,"I'm looking at the price point for one and then I just now came to my senses. I'll spend that on a few rods and reels, hardware at 15 bucks each and ferget aboud the fuel to get out 10 miles to the fish and back but won't for the sake of my body. How stupid is that? Time to take a ride out to the truck bone yard to see what they have. Then if that doesn't work pony up the Simolians and stop being cheap and stupid. Thanks for the reminder about those seats Musky Plug. Heck you probably have 500 bucks tied up in Musky Plugs in your back up tackle box for what you nuts pay for those bricks you toss. They‚Äôre awesome seats. I‚Äôve tried them on Erie when I was with my friend navigating¬†4ft + rollers in his 22 foot walleye boat. Worked well and my back was fine. The third guy who didn‚Äôt have one said he felt 2‚Äù shorter from spinal compression lol. And yes¬†I‚Äôve been told I have a problem lol. But hey have to get ready for that body building comp somehow lol¬†üòé"
