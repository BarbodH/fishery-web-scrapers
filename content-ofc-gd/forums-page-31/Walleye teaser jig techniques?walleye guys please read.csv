That particular one is a bottom dragger, at least that is the use without the blade, the blade just gives it a bit of flash and different sound = look = push as it moves thru the water. If I were to use one? It would be tipped with a minnow or half a nightcrawler and either a drift or slow troll, you could cast or jig them too, but that might run you thru bait a lot quicker."
