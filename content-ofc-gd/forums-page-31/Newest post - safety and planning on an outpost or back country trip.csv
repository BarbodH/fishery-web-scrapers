I love it and had big plans for this year but we all know how that went! I had been intending to take a few bushcraft courses, including navigation and first aid. As soon as it's safe to do I will get back on that. I've also been concerned about communication. I did my first solo last year and it was one of the best times of my life. I want to do more so I've been looking at the Garmin InReach Explorer+ for two-way communications and rescue security."
1059410,gordy28,2020-04-10 11:30:00,638,Glad you enjoyed it Dutch If you are in the GTA watch groupon or call Dave Arama (I highlighted him in the post) we did groupon for his course and was reasonable for us and really good I have looked at the Garmins as well and they have a great rep.  Generally I do one trip max a year where cell phone is no good so we have generally just rented a satellite phone and bring my handheld GPS Cheers Andrew
1059469,chris.brock,2020-04-11 00:41:00,4053,"good post, important topic the older I get, the more cautious I get and the more I think about this stuff because of all the stuff and close calls that have happened while in a remote setting I think the most important thing is a way to communicate to get help if you need it   here's our ride out from a remote canoe trip that went wrong because we had a Spot Sat Messenger  I know a guy who had no communication on a fly in trip, his father in law died of a heart attack on the 2nd day and the weather was 30 C plus everyday for the rest of the week I buried a big siwash into the back of my brother's head a few years ago on a fly in, thank God it wasn't his eye crap happens, a way to communicate and get help is important   "
1059490,fisherman7,2020-04-11 13:24:00,325,I always pay the extra $s to rent the sat phone from the outfitter. Haven't had to use it but nice to know it's there if I need it.
1059499,gordy28,2020-04-11 15:07:00,638,Wow Chris those are some scary stories I agree w all re a way to communicate.  Roughly our sat phone packages worked out to $30 a guy for our week long trips.  Worth the peace of mind IMO Cheers Andrew

1059731,Woodsman,2020-04-14 07:14:00,1286,"What I missed was although a first aid kit was mentioned, it didn't say a good one. Most kits for $20-30 range will be almost useless in a life threatening situation. Also someone with the training in first aid might be useful."
