Again, my twist .       And a 1st try at a dragon fly . Sure is a ugly bug . LOL  Rigged up the fly rod today  . Now to get to that wide open space river spot . "
1060416,Terry,2020-04-21 16:17:00,14456,They look good Let’s hope things open up to use them
1060429,porkpie,2020-04-21 17:53:00,2521,"Nice fly’s.  We had a huge midge hatch yesterday, get your magnifying glass out lol"
1060430,misfish,2020-04-21 18:11:00,29133, Thanks pal I wished I lived just down the street from you . LOL I have a mag/light .  Hell I need it .LOL Now to get mag glasses to tie the knots .LOL     
1060440,porkpie,2020-04-21 19:42:00,2521,The knots are becoming my downfall.  Half of my knots these days end in curled line and a missing hook lol.  I really have to squint and pay attention to what I’m doing!
1060461,Rattletrap2,2020-04-21 21:16:00,1652,When exactly is this mayfly hatch coming? I am staring at a total white out blizzard outside my window at the moment! lol

1060622,Garnet,2020-04-23 11:07:00,2056,Don't know if you have noticed small black bugs on the snow warm afternoons . Stoneflys.
1060627,misfish,2020-04-23 13:13:00,29133,Yup. Got some of those too .
1060628,dave524,2020-04-23 13:35:00,4508,"Interesting pattern, how well do they float without hackle? I assume they are dry flies with the wings. "
1060641,misfish,2020-04-23 15:42:00,29133,"Ya I do not think they will float great . Just a take my way Dave . If they catch,I am on to something eh . LOL"

1060753,Old Ironmaker,2020-04-25 01:14:00,8243,"We had frozen slush and snow on the deck yesterday AM. This afternoon we got our 1st bug attack of the year. We went for a walk after dinner and I ate about 1000 of those little black bastardo's. A tip for bug season for the front of your vehicles. I spray Pan cooking spray all over the front of my wife's Kia and my Silverado. No matter how many bugs get splattered onto the bumpers, grill, headlights and mirrors etc. they just wipe off with a clean micro cloth then wash or re spray."
1060770,RayK,2020-04-25 12:31:00,25,"Nice ties Misfish, they could pass for spinners. Experimentation is what it’s all about. I had the same thoughts as Dave in regards to hackle, and I’m sure they’ll work great."
