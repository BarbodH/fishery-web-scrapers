This means that fishing on the boardwalk, docks, and pier south of the CN railway tracks is not permitted and signage is being placed there to discourage group gatherings, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Further, the Municipal Boat Launch is now closed to the public. The Launch will only be used by Emergency Service personnel, if required. "
