1061069,captpierre,2020-04-30 14:44:00,2521,Went out on my subdivision road this morning to look for worms after the rain.  The robins must have beat me to them. “The early bird gets the worm...”
1061070,Garnet,2020-04-30 14:51:00,2056,Don't use road worms they have road rash . Will contaminate your good worms and all will die.
1061073,misfish,2020-04-30 15:22:00,29133,"Yup, learned that . They do not survive for some reason."
1061076,dave524,2020-04-30 15:33:00,4508,"headlamp in the evening, after dark when it rains, 48 ounce can strapped to each calf, always found damp sphagnum moss to be the best to keep them in."
1061077,irishfield,2020-04-30 15:36:00,26272,"I've never seen so many huge dew worms. Every clump of sod I was moving back to where it belonged on Monday,  from that careless snow plow guy, had dozens and dozens in every clump."
1061078,Terry,2020-04-30 15:40:00,14456,Damn plow guy rips up your lawn and drinks all your Pepsi
1061082,lew,2020-04-30 16:24:00,12766,Lotsa worms on my front walk this morning.
1061085,KraTToR,2020-04-30 16:44:00,506,"My dealer has a good supply and they are especially big this spring.  He did state that due to the pandemic, stocks are low and prices will climb. Gawd I hate bending over tho.."
1061086,captpierre,2020-04-30 16:44:00,2521,"Lots of smiling, stuffed robins around here. 😎"
1061087,Fisherman,2020-04-30 16:45:00,7201,"Yup, they're having to take a run before they become airborne."
1061090,crappieperchhunter,2020-04-30 17:20:00,2582,"Been using road worms for over 20 years....once I got too lazy to collect them at night with a flashlight and have never had a problem. I collect them after a rain and they go straight into fresh moss I pick out of my back yard with a sprinkle of corn meal to feed them.  Then they are in my fridge until I use them. Generally get used up quickly but I have had them in the fridge for 2 months without a problem, just have to give them some more cornmeal every once in a while. In all this time I might of had a dozen dead ones. Maybe our street here doesn't have any harmful chemicals on the pavement or whatever causes the worms to be contaminated?"
1061091,Lukasaurus,2020-04-30 17:25:00,19,"I picked up a bar fridge yesterday for $20. I am hoping to stock up before the marina on Nipissing opens up at the end of May. I will be out tonight picking. When I was young I used to bend over while picking worms, now I am on all fours with a head light. My back isn't what it used to be."
1061093,misfish,2020-04-30 17:40:00,29133,I laugh cuz I feel yer pain . Same boat.  LOL
1061097,KraTToR,2020-04-30 18:23:00,506,I prefer not to stuff them before they go into the oven... 
1061098,irishfield,2020-04-30 18:28:00,26272,"Funny, I go to get the mail from the site box and the kids down at the 4 way stop have a table and cooler out  at the end of their laneway with a giant WORMS sign on it !"
1061099,aplumma,2020-04-30 19:04:00,6896,"The old saying is "" the early bird gets the worm."" Wake up earlier. lol Art"
1061100,Garnet,2020-04-30 19:51:00,2056,"I made small fortune selling dew worms. Dad thought it was crazy Idea we lived on HWy 2 west of Whitby. Started out at 1 cent a worm then up price to 2 cents, I got nice french fry box for worms. Most where repeat customers if I wasn't home they got there Worms and left money in door I'd have $5- 10 some days. 1967 my dad was driving truck for $95 a week. Bought my parents a frig and later a stand up freezer. Think everybody in family had it at some time."
1061109,Rizzo,2020-04-30 22:23:00,4754,"gonna go get me some tonight. I don't ever see the juicy big ones in the morning, but at night? look out. Yard is covered in em"
1061110,Bill,2020-04-30 23:11:00,140,The Robins are eating well this year in my front yard.
1061121,misfish,2020-05-01 10:47:00,29133,There is a bunch on the walk here. Those nice small ones. Scooped up a couple dozen for those finicky little guys that wont take the fly .
1061126,LeXXington,2020-05-01 13:21:00,1928,Lots out last night and in the AM.   Most of that rain missed us just light sprinkle for a few hours and that was it
1061129,porkpie,2020-05-01 14:13:00,2521,"I bought a ton of beautiful crawlers in Amherstburg last week, they had coolers full.  Cheap like Borscht too.  Let’s hope that remains the same."
1061133,Garnet,2020-05-01 15:07:00,2056,The commercial people raise African red worms they are a lot more hardy. They are more pointed and red than dew worms. Don't know any golf course picking anymore. I ran my worm bis 2-3 years. Made fortunes and even loan sharked my parents friends I never liked them so interest was atrocious. I picked on bus in Columbus for couple weeks even young maybe 15-16 tough way to make money. The bus stopped across the road from our house so easy. Can't remember last time I used worms. 
1061137,misfish,2020-05-01 16:01:00,29133,I remember way back getting these worms I think. They did not need to be refrigerated . Kept in a warm place. I put the ones I had on top of some ducting. They were gone when I grabbed the box 2 days later. Think it was hotter then warm. They evaporated . LOL
1061247,Garnet,2020-05-03 15:57:00,2056,It's incredible how far away that ground is. I use to watch  my dad struggle to pick things thinking never happening to me. WRONG WRONG WRONG
