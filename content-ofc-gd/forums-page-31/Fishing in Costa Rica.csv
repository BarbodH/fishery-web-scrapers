1055731,jimmer,2020-01-27 20:39:00,2730,"Was in Costa Rica recently on a last minute trip. Had some fun fishing with guys I met down there. I even caught a jackÂ off the beach and lost some others. We did the best fishing in 400 feet of water, lol. We let the guys that took us out bring the fish to market to make some extra cash for themselves.   "
1055737,lew,2020-01-27 21:42:00,12766,Nice haul of fish Jimmer and really generous of you to let the guides keep them for the extra $$$$
1055739,jimmer,2020-01-27 23:27:00,2730,Thanks Lew. I was only able to do that because 2 amazing fellow anglers invited me to go with them. Us Canadians are amazing to each other!
1055740,misfish,2020-01-27 23:51:00,29133,Very cool. 400 FOW ? How far out is that from shore there ? I would of kept 1 fish to try. Some look like they are from the cod family .
1055743,gordy28,2020-01-28 02:16:00,638,"AwesomeÂ  thanks for sharing I was there (near Liberia) last march w the family ut couldn't justify the cost to fish on my own.Â  Glad you hooked up! We loved our trip though, one of my favourites so far "
1055744,jimmer,2020-01-28 02:29:00,2730,7 -8 miles out.
1055745,Old Ironmaker,2020-01-28 03:13:00,8243,"No such thing as Catch and release south of the US border. Glad you had a great trip.Â  I always had a great time in Costa Rica, 25 years ago now. A Hamiltonian I knew had a little place down there with a few beach huts and a Pizzeria of course. Never fished, too busy relaxing."
1055750,Big Cliff,2020-01-28 09:57:00,6899,Nice haul! Glad you got the chance to get out and do some fishingðŸ˜Š
1055771,captpierre,2020-01-29 00:49:00,2521,So am I rightÂ Â to assume you were bottom fishing? Â In 400 ft?ðŸ˜²
1055825,jimmer,2020-01-29 23:37:00,2730,"It was a workout,Â that's for sure! They would hit as soon as the bait hit the bottom."
1055826,captpierre,2020-01-29 23:48:00,2521,Itâ€™s amazing fish can thrive down there. The pressure has to be stupid high. I bet they didnâ€™t enjoy the trip up.

1055831,muskybw,2020-01-30 00:29:00,116,"i said the same thing 30 yrs. in Cabo San Lucas, marlin fishing ? we caught 2 striped marlins, every other boat (30) had marlin flags flying on the mast ! how can the species survive, i said ??????????? deck hands butchered them, sold the meat to close by resorts i guess."
1055843,jimmer,2020-01-30 16:24:00,2730,Some that got off half way up eventually came to the top and the birds scooped them.
