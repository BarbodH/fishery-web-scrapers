1060438,KraTToR,2020-04-21 19:34:00,506,Cabin fever has definitely set in so I'm planning on getting out in the Bay of Quinte for some spring Crappie fishing to hold me over until the walleye opener. Its been decades since I targeted this species so I was wondering if you would mind sharing some tips relating to the area and time of year.  
1060439,porkpie,2020-04-21 19:40:00,2521,Where do you live?
1060441,KraTToR,2020-04-21 19:57:00,506,"I'm in Belle - Vegas during the week, then back home to KW for the weekends.¬† Why?"
1060444,grimsbylander,2020-04-21 20:25:00,3016,He wants to know how far his drive will be to go crappie fishing with you. We all saw your boat. üòÅ
1060452,misfish,2020-04-21 20:43:00,29133,"If he comes to Barrie when all this crap is done,I,ll guide and show him all the good spots . Well, a few of them anyways . That is a sweet ride he has."
1060458,KraTToR,2020-04-21 21:04:00,506,Stay on topic please  
1060464,misfish,2020-04-21 21:25:00,29133,"If you didn't show yer sexy boaty, well,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"
1060476,OhioFisherman,2020-04-21 22:57:00,6623,"Far and away my best days of crappie fishing were with an Emerald shiner ( live bait ). On a spreader with 2 hooks ( check your laws ) or even a single hook under a float. Just the fastest, most consistent way I have ever caught them."
1060482,mikeh,2020-04-21 23:08:00,824,"slip float with a wooly bugger jig/fly, I have used one with a white body and a pink head, during the spawn find them in 2-3 feet of water in small back bays that have some weed growth. I have fished them in the Kawarthas using these methods. Also fish around cattails or ¬†bullrush with your slip float . good luck out there and stay safe"
1060484,moxie,2020-04-21 23:10:00,1566,There's a lake just South of where we are in Arden that has both decent numbers and size and I think I might finally give it a go. Long way off but the Mon Tues forecast looks cherry
1060490,KraTToR,2020-04-22 01:21:00,506,"HI Mike, long time eh?¬† Thanks for the tips."
1060491,KraTToR,2020-04-22 01:23:00,506,Please send pic of boat and motor???
1060500,porkpie,2020-04-22 03:41:00,2521,"I was just wondering why you‚Äôd go all the way to BOQ when there was better crappie much closer, that‚Äôs all. ¬†I thought you where from SW ont, but it all makes sense now! ¬†Have fun."
1060507,misfish,2020-04-22 09:12:00,29133, Is this not your boat ? LOL  
1060509,KraTToR,2020-04-22 11:19:00,506,"Yep, that's in the Massassauga Provincial Park.  "
1060510,KraTToR,2020-04-22 11:25:00,506,"Yes, unfortunately much of the business I do takes me away from home.¬† BOQ is not my favourite fishing spot¬† but I do ok there in May.¬† I figured that there should be a few slabs out there for the taking in some of those back bays where the water is warming up.¬† I really wanted to get out on Percy's Reach as the Pike season is open there all year but the launch is closed Buggernutz. "
1060514,AKRISONER,2020-04-22 12:02:00,5558,"Well just speaking from my personal experience from two days ago on g bay, the craps aren‚Äôt anywhere near shallow yet. They are continuing to stage up out in front of their shallow spawning areas. Water is damn cold and aint getting any warmer with these -12???? Overnight temperatures and fresh snow on the ground every morning. Was 41 degrees on the graph on Sunday. so cold the fish were getting stunned when I brought em in. The small ones took a moment to revive even when lip hooked.¬†May as well put the ice back on lol. Quinte May warm up a bit earlier than g bay, but I wouldn‚Äôt expect any craps to be even close to up shallow yet. i like the idea of the wooly bugger under the float. I was getting them this past weekend on a small buckshot in firetiger tipped with a minnow head. But I was fishing a float in 30 fow letting the waves do the jiggin and me focusing on just keeping my line managed in the damn 40kmh+¬†winds we‚Äôve been having every single day."
1060518,KraTToR,2020-04-22 12:26:00,506,"Yea, lots of wind here yesterday and -2 this morning.¬† That damn March warm spell we seem to get every year now fooled me again!¬† Anyways, Friday and Saturday look great to at least get the boat wet and check some water temps.."
1060531,David Chong,2020-04-22 14:18:00,836,Mini tubes and hair jigs beneath a slip float is the best way to catch them! Because of where their eyes¬†are located they always feed upwards plus who doesn't love seeing a float go down!
1060532,Wallyman,2020-04-22 14:28:00,31,Unless you know someone with a private ramp I wouldn't bother with the drive ! ¬† Even our camp is closed until further notice. Regards
1060544,msp,2020-04-22 15:20:00,1336,Apparently all the launches are closed on BOQ.You may want to consider this before driving out. I don't target Crappie on BOQ however I have caught HUGE slabs on full size jerkbaits there in the past.
1060588,KraTToR,2020-04-22 21:48:00,506,"I have access to a private ramp and from what I understand, these waters hold big craps... Its just finding them. Mine you, as all year classes seem to stick together, if I can find 1, I'll have enough for dinner "
1060638,AKRISONER,2020-04-23 14:40:00,5558,crappies most certainly do not group by size at all from my experience. youll catch a 4 incher and catch a 13 incher right after. Just a matter of finding those 10 inch eaters.
