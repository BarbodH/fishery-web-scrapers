What are the chances of Joe Schmoe dying in Ontario from Covid?  BTW, I simply said I have nothing against you."
1061057,Terry,2020-04-30 02:00:00,14456,"And I find when people say they have nothing against someone, it usually means they do but will try to not hold it against them you seem to be making it personal as I said my numbers are important to me i never said  your numbers were unimportant usa death per m  186 canada 79 per m but as you said 	guess we win"
1060604,kreighoff,2020-04-23 00:25:00,2,"I stopped going out for the trout opening 10 yrs ago its usually insanely overcrowded. I wait a week or two and all the wannabe's are no longer there. If we can't fish or its greatly reduced for this season let's look forward to how good it could be next season. Maybe I'll  buy a few live trout and stock the pool, might tick off the wife but at least I'll be at home."
1060605,GBW,2020-04-23 01:04:00,8460,I have a pool at my new place in 2 weeks and I told the Mrs I am turning it into a freshwater pond and stocking it with some form of fish for me to catch and eat the odd time.
1060607,grimsbylander,2020-04-23 01:52:00,3016,"Regardless of what the number is, it should still be the focal point of concern. IMHO there is no acceptable number regardless of what the total population is.  	Covid 19 knows no borders. It’s the virus against humans. So the only percentage that really matters is the one that includes world totals. Hence the entire argument regarding social distancing...no one is in this alone and our actions influence others."
1060608,Crimsongulf,2020-04-23 02:05:00,294,"I don't disagree, by the same token raw numbers are thrown out for sensationalism and ratings. If the actual fatality rate was used, it wouldn't be as sensational."
1060609,grimsbylander,2020-04-23 02:14:00,3016,Huh? Are you saying the death toll is artificially inflated for ratings??? Seriously?? The numbers are on a US government website and I’m 100% positive the big kahuna there wants anything but Covid sensationalism.
1060611,Crimsongulf,2020-04-23 02:22:00,294,"I didn't say that at all.  I said raw numbers with no correlation to population are being used for ratings. Especially now that NY is counting ""suspected"" corona deaths with no facts in the official count. 45,000 sounds much more sensational than .00014% of the population."
1060613,grimsbylander,2020-04-23 02:41:00,3016,"Im not exactly sure who you are saying wants to sensationalize it? Media? Maybe. So why isn’t the gov.com website saying .00014%? If anything, they absolutely want to minimize the impact  to protect their positions."
1060616,Crimsongulf,2020-04-23 03:03:00,294," Yes the media is doing it to sensationalize.  Why do you need a website.  45000 divided by 330,000,000 = .00014%.  I simply used a calculator."
1060617,grimsbylander,2020-04-23 03:29:00,3016,You’re missing my point
1060618,MJIG,2020-04-23 03:33:00,227,"Isn’t 45,000 out of a population of 330,000,000 actually .0136% ? "
1060701,Crimsongulf,2020-04-24 01:02:00,294,Not by the calculator that I used. https://calculator.com/standard-tape/
1060703,irishfield,2020-04-24 03:05:00,26272,Suggest you revist your grade 6 memories on how to calculate percentages...
1061022,Rizzo,2020-04-29 16:43:00,4754,remember...to get % you move the decimal over 2 places...so I would say .0136%
1061036,Woodsman,2020-04-29 20:22:00,1286,I agree with those saying .0136.
1061040,Crimsongulf,2020-04-29 21:54:00,294,"That is fine, it is still a minuscule number.  I concede that I was wrong on the decimal point.  Yay for y'all."
1061042,Woodsman,2020-04-29 22:16:00,1286,But the .0136 is the percentage of death for the whole population not the percentage of those infected which would be far higher. But we have no way of determining how many were/are infected as there isn't wide spread testing.
1061043,Terry,2020-04-29 22:34:00,14456,I thought Ontario has almost 16000 cases and almost 10000 deaths seems like one in sixteen is fatal 
1061044,Crimsongulf,2020-04-29 23:14:00,294,"Who knows how many are actually infected.  This entire deal is a manipulated numbers game to support agendas regardless of which side of the fence you are on.  Me, I am going to live my life taking into account China flu, but in no way is it going to put a halt to my normal life. I understand folks like to take potshots at the US, it has always been that way.  You can only apply infection and fatality rates to the entire population to get a true picture.  If you take European countries, lump them together to get to a population number equal to the US, their fatality rate is double."
1061046,MJIG,2020-04-29 23:23:00,227,Ontario has had a total of 996 deaths as of today. https://covid-19.ontario.ca/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIlo-1peOO6QIVPyqzAB2slgjyEAAYASABEgLP6PD_BwE#section-0

1061049,Crimsongulf,2020-04-29 23:47:00,294,"Again, you can take numbers and prove anything.  Ontario has about a population of 14.5 Million with 996 deaths.  Florida has a population of 20.2 million with 1218 deaths with the oldest population in the US.  Who is winning?"
1061050,Terry,2020-04-30 00:24:00,14456,"From where I sit you can only count the deaths per number of people who have had the virus let’s face it ,if you don’t catch the virus the chances of death from covid is 0"
1061051,Woodsman,2020-04-30 00:27:00,1286,Terry that's only based on confirmed deaths with a confirmed infection. They are not testing everyone by far. Those effected without symptoms unless working with or exposed to a confirmed infected  person do not get tested. No way to confirm a percentage of those infected that die. Information is just not there.
1061053,Terry,2020-04-30 00:42:00,14456,Yeah but you can’t do the math on unknown numbers or you just get deaths = X 
1061054,Crimsongulf,2020-04-30 01:00:00,294,"I am just going to leave that there, k.  If you divide deaths by the population, you get my number.  I will be sure and send you a pic of when I am at the cottage in June after I have been told here that it can't happen.  I have nothing against you and if you want to hang your hat on a decimal point, enjoy."

1060279,Douger,2020-04-19 16:32:00,116,"I can see both sides.  It's a good point about reducing traffic, thereby reducing accidents.  On the other hand, BC's provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry recommends getting outside as a way get through this because it supports physical and mental health.  I was out yesterday at an isolated river location.  Felt great to be outdoors for a day and I didn't break any social distancing rules.  The Humber river multi-use trail near my place is steady with people.  On the weekends it can be challenge to maintain 2 metres."
1060329,GregF2,2020-04-20 13:21:00,46,"Not sure Canada dodged a bullet.  Majority of US cases are in NYC/NJ area, whose total population is bigger than a lot of Countries.  Compare the stats of US population to Canada.  In my State of Ohio, population of 12 million, our numbers are very low and we still allow fishing and golfing, which both are much safer than going to the local crowded parks or Costco/Grocery stores.  We also start opening up on May 1st, slowly, but you can not keep living like this forever, otherwise their will economic collapse. Banning fishing is ridiculous, especially Lake fishing.  People just need to make sure they are practicing social distancing and if they are not, like in some rivers, then the locality should shut those down. When I fish in Ohio, it is on a bank and there is no one else around.  Virus can’t spread that way.  Same as golfing, my course has a lot less people than a park and you don’t touch anything except your club. No need for such extreme rules and Ohio is proof of that as are other States.   If people are that paranoid, then stay in your house, but don’t let your paranoia ruin it for others that are practicing safe social distancing.    Crazy - you can’t keep living in fear. I look at Sweden and some other Countries too and they have some of the least stringent rules and are surviving still without closing anything. "
1060332,Dutch01,2020-04-20 13:31:00,1431,"So COVID-19 is a bullet and is hitting every country differently. We are faring reasonably well so far hence the expression ""dodged a bullet so far"" which fits fine for me. Fishing isn't banned here and I'm not paranoid. I simply said I was fishing locally where there will be no other anglers.  If you're from Ohio you have really have no idea about the Ganny. Fishing shoulder  to shoulder is not an exaggeration."
1060333,GregF2,2020-04-20 13:59:00,46,"I do though.  My family and I have been fishing in the Rice Lake for over 50 years, multiple times a year and over Canadian Thanksgiving too.  Also, other areas of Canada, like Kesagami, skiing out west, etc....   Love the Ganny and love Canada!  I always feel it is my second Country and always brag about Canada to everyone, since we travel their so much!! Hate seeing those people fishing shoulder to shoulder snagging fish and that is what I am talking about.  Your local municipality could ban fishing their then, so those are the people that would usually abuse it.  They did it in some of our rivers this spring."
1060335,Dutch01,2020-04-20 14:47:00,1431,"Okay so you do know the circus lol As far as I know the local municipality has now restricted all public access now, if so it will be private property only. I don't even go there for the opener on a non-COVID year!"

1060520,squirrel761,2020-04-22 13:07:00,30,I was hoping they would close the season. My daughter works in the emergency ward of our small hospital and they had a guy who lives 2 hours away come in with a dislocated shoulder. He has slipped on a rock while fishing. This needlessly exposes our front line people to possible carriers. And I know some will say you can slip in your shower but at least you are local. We don't need people coming into town just to go fishing. I have a boat sitting in the driveway I can't use and I'm content to do that till this is over. Just my opinion.
1060568,grimsbylander,2020-04-22 18:54:00,3016,There’s some deep thinking going on there. 😂
1060576,Terry,2020-04-22 19:58:00,14456,"The blog was an attempt to do my part in helping us rid ourselves of this scourge called COVID-19. With the upcoming opening of trout season (April 25th) in most parts of Ontario, I thought we as anglers should be proactive and postpone the opening until we have a better handle on when we can resume some sort of normality. LISTEN TO ANGELO’S RADIO RESPONSE HERE Our biggest concern was spreading the virus on opening night along the many tributaries that dump into our Great Lakes. Those of us not in denial all know the sh&$?t show that is opening of trout season in southern Ontario on the banks of the Ganny, Wilmot, and Credit to name a few. I thought that giving up fishing for a few more days or even weeks would be a small price to pay considering what we have all given up already. Due to the reluctance of the government to suspend the trout opener, I thought the unselfish act from the angling community would be greatly appreciated by the folks who have lost family members, lost jobs, lost businesses, and have put their lives on the line every day as first responders. Evidently, I thought wrong, and for that, I must apologize. I apologize to the good people who were exposed to the garbage and vile behavior of the handful of keyboard warriors that saw fit to violate the Fish’n Canada digital properties last Wednesday. I apologize to the advertisers and supporters of the Fish’n Canada brand who were bombarded by these misguided souls at a time when our sponsors have far more pressing concerns, like the welfare of their employees and families. But most importantly I apologize to those of you who were led to believe that the Fish’n Canadashow has now somehow become anti-fishing. To those people I say please read the blog again, I may be guilty of a lot of things but turning my back on fishing and the Fish’n Canada audience is not one of them. Calling people that would not be willing to give up the trout opener, whiny, sniveling little brats, I admit may have been a little excessive. Not considering that the folks from remote parts of the province, where little to no fishing pressure is present, can, in fact, go fishing without violating the pandemic protocols. To all of you that fall into these categories, my most sincere and heartfelt apologies. Finally, to the keyboard Warriors (and I now know who you are) that started all of this I only ask that you reflect on your actions of last week and know that although we may not always agree with each other’s views and opinions we do have a commonality that bonds us, the love of the outdoors and the passion to fish, let us not tarnish those great qualities. If you are venturing out on Trout Opening, be safe and enjoy! Thank you and be safe out there."
1060577,Fisherman,2020-04-22 20:06:00,7201,I can remember going to Lake X with dad about 50 years ago and catch a pile of them off his friends dock in early May.  I learned how to clean fish pretty quick.
1060578,Crimsongulf,2020-04-22 20:06:00,294,"New York, New Jersey and Connecticut have opened all marinas and boatyards."
1060579,grimsbylander,2020-04-22 20:16:00,3016,"Of course, this is an indicator of nothing."
1060593,Crimsongulf,2020-04-22 22:09:00,294,I think in a way that it is with NYC being the epicenter in the US.  It does show that with common sense things can be opened up and the entire state is not a one size fits all. Look at Michigan.  They have a problem with the Detroit area but impose the most draconian rules in the country on the entire state.  The UP ain't Detroit.
1060599,grimsbylander,2020-04-22 23:01:00,3016,"Can be opened up and should be opened up are significantly different. I have to question the logic when the top 1 & 2 US States with approximately 350,000 of the total US 802,000 Covid cases are increasing access to public contact. More than half of all Covid deaths in the US are in NY and NJ alone. I’m no health expert but following the models used in countries and areas that have already worked seems like a sensible idea. I commented because your statement contained so little info, other than they are opening access, I found it ambiguous and misleading. Personally I’m far from convinced it is a good decision. It’s becoming more about succumbing to public pressure than body count."
1060600,Crimsongulf,2020-04-22 23:34:00,294,"The flip side is that the fishing isn't very good in Manhattan.  The problem to me is the one size fits all. I will admit that I have never been good with following ""rules"" that defy common sense."
1060601,grimsbylander,2020-04-22 23:58:00,3016,"If leaders do too much OR too little they will be criticized. So we have to ask, which side of wrong should they risk being on?? I can’t see how taking time to carefully divide up States so some people can go fishing is a good use of resources. Considering people travel it’s also futile. I do find it interesting though that people seem more outraged over restrictions than concerned about the 45,000 dead people. I’m saying you are, but the rallies would indicate it."
1060602,Crimsongulf,2020-04-23 00:09:00,294,"Rather than looking at a raw number (45,000) I try to look at things in context.  There is approx. 330M population in the US.

It's frustrating when many do as they are asked like go into work everyday risking bringing home the virus to a healthy family or just sticking it out at home. Then a few, including some here, insist on going fishing. It's not just the spread of the virus the Stay Home helps minimize it's just being out on the roads, rivers and lakes we don't want you all to be simply because any accidents that involve travel or sporting activities puts a strain on our 1st responders from the Police right down to an emergency room nurse. Why can't some people get that? If I see you fishing out on the lake in front of our shack your getting the middle finger from me."

When I am there, I am working beside someone, on some of the lines as close as 2 feet apart, passing parts to the next person and them to the next person and so on, assembly line work. How an industry like this is essential in times like this is beyond me, but the government says it is so I will have to return to work when they need me. If I can go to work and work in those conditions, protective equipment or not, then I can trailer my boat 3 hours to an area where I will see, maybe a handful of people all day, not stopping for anything there and back.

1060051,Terry,2020-04-16 21:20:00,14456,"Fishing season will open as usual in Ontario in May. That’s according the premier Doug Ford. In an exclusive interview with Acadia News, he says though they aren’t encouraging any fishing tournaments at this time, due to physical distancing protocols as a result of COVID-19. “Fishing will still be open, but the fishing derbies, we’re requesting, we’re not putting an order in, but I think it’s common sense, we don’t want the fishing derbies to happen.” While a number of boat launches are closed, Ford is encouraging anglers to get out, mind their physical distances and fish from shore. “If people want to make sure of their social distance and they’re on the shore and they want to throw a reel and hook in the water then by all means.” Walleye season is scheduled to open the third Saturday in May.

1060066,dave524,2020-04-17 01:13:00,4508,"Only a very few will be able to take advantage of the open seasons, primarily lakefront and river property owners. Just because the season is open doesn't mean you can access public property to fish,  Sylvan Glen is still off limits on opener. 🤣"
1060069,Terry,2020-04-17 01:25:00,14456,Yes but it could let municipalities loosen their grip on ramps and fishing areas
1060078,AKRISONER,2020-04-17 03:21:00,5558,"Well first of all, didn’t the municipality of port Hope just close the river access anyways? most of the ramps are closed in Ontario. I personally think any public dock should also be closed to avoid contact with moorings. but to stop fishing entirely for people with private access to lakes, or that can access via some other means...use your common sense.  im not holding my breath though that the river rats ruin it for everyone else next week when they flock in droves to park accesses etc that are closed. what’s strange to me is that fishing regulations have no problem applying wildly different rules for various bodies of water and species but the fishing debate is somehow singular all or nothing? call me crazy but joe blow going out in a canoe with his kid on a lake somewhere is far far different than everyone stacking up on the pier at port dal. I’ll be fishing softwater for the first time in 5 months tomorrow, the tinner is rigged and waiting to be pushed into Georgian bay. And I sure as hell won’t be interacting with anyone lol, and definitely far less than the tim Hortons drive thru!"
1060079,Dutch01,2020-04-17 03:46:00,1431,"I still urge people to minimize their travel and exposure to people, and to take this virus very seriously. IF we dodge the bullet that is hitting the US and other countries right now I think it will be because of the degree that we were compliant with all recommendations. In fairness though there's nothing in your comment I can really disagree with. The law is the law. Some will do more than the min and some won't and it's hard to call anyone wrong if they haven't broken the law. I have been out of my house twice in the last two weeks, but I will be fishing trout opener, alone. I can hear the laughing now 😂 I will actually be alone because I have a trout creek in my actual backyard, and another good spot a 10 minute walk. In 5 years fishing them I've never seen another angler. I do think Akri is right about the shoot show at places like the Ganny. Based on what I've seen there in the past I can't imagine that lot can behave themselves and they just might wreck it for the rest of us."
1060115,craigdritchie,2020-04-17 15:08:00,1586,"I think this is the kind of scenario that Ang is referring to, and it is exactly what opening weekend of trout season will look like in many, many areas. That's the problem.     "
