1059330,Terry,2020-04-09 14:54:00,14456,"People are not getting it.  	I went to ctc for curb pickup a man and child were standing by their vehicle ,woman from ctc  walks up with bicycle and stuff , child runs over to her and grabs the bike from her the man grabs the helmet and other stuff from her signs the paper within inches of her and I believe touching her  No distancing ,no ppe . this is how it spreads.  My turn, I rolled down my window an inch and said please set it down there and walk away I will sign it and get back in my vehicle you can get the paperwork and leave. She was happy to do it.  With gloves on I signed got back in the truck she took her paper work and left .I grabbed the stuff. Later disinfect everything and wash hands    This is how not to spread the virus  please do it right people"

1059393,chris.brock,2020-04-10 00:29:00,4053,"Like Terry's story, I had a good propane tank fill yesterday. The lady is in the office, I put my tank on the scale and move away. She comes out and fills my tank with gloves on and leaves. I get the tank and put it in my vehicle. The door is open to the office, I walk in, she's on the other side of the room, I tap my credit card and leave without closing the door. I disinfect my hands and credit card before getting back in the car. We did a transaction and never came within 20 feet of each other."
1059416,Yellow Fever,2020-04-10 12:45:00,139,"Folks....while the ban may seem stupid to "" local "" anglers the shut down is to prevent anglers traveling.  I was fishing on March 13 for Lakers out of Kingston and there has been a truck and trailer from Quebec here for 2 days  in all likleyhood they stopped for gas/ food and maybe overnight. This is what they are trying to stop. Think about the ""good fishing"" areas like St Kitts where guys spend a week and show up by the dozens.  YouTube. ..Jim Lyon Fishing"
1059790,Lake Erie Bait and Tackle,2020-04-14 20:28:00,25,Hopefully everything gets back to normal soon and we get the boats on the water!  Need to catch our dinners...important more now than ever!
1058484,huzzsaba,2020-03-31 22:01:00,884,"I have been hearing opp and local police are pulling people over and asking their intentions of being out.  Anything non essential and there is risk of being fined.  Not sure how true this is, but what does this mean for shore fishing?"
1058487,Terry,2020-03-31 22:19:00,14456,"Innisfil has closed all parks  so boat ramps are closed , all shore fishing spots are concerned parks here so no fishing. All the shore fishing spots in Keswick along the canals are closed not looking good."
1058504,Big Cliff,2020-04-01 01:41:00,6899,No nonessential travel
1058505,Can_38,2020-04-01 01:57:00,152,"Is launching a boat solo, fishing solo and returning home considered travelling?  Or is this good social distancing?"
1058508,irishfield,2020-04-01 02:41:00,26272,Yep on both cases. It's gonna get crazier than it already is.
1058517,Terry,2020-04-01 10:14:00,14456,Going to get real crazy
1058523,Big Cliff,2020-04-01 12:30:00,6899,"What I don't get is why so many people seem to want to test the limits. This virus doesn't spread all by itself, it only spreads when people move!"
1058527,LefroyFisherman,2020-04-01 13:14:00,602,"Gonna be a real rough summer if we can't at least go fishing to get away a little bit... I suppose it's what we have to do. I would have thought that would be good for social distancing, but I guess people will travel with their boat, meet at the launch and grab bait and food, so more spread."
1058528,LefroyFisherman,2020-04-01 13:15:00,602,"I just dug a 25 by 20 foot hole 12 inches deep for a garage pad by hand, maybe I'll fill it with water and get some panfish LOL"
1058546,OhioFisherman,2020-04-01 15:08:00,6623,"One of our area grocery chains has started posting a list of stores that employees have tested positive, they also have gas stations, so you just never know where the person in front of you has been or had contact with. We can't seem to keep our own medical professionals safe, and people are still taking chances?"
1058547,limeyangler,2020-04-01 15:15:00,5204,"I leave from my house, and i'm on the lake, I don't go anywhere near any people if I even see anyone, I have enough gas to last a year lol and my wife does the shop only when necessary."

We aren't anywhere near over this round and they expect a return in the fall? Will it need different shots every year like the flu? I expect so?
1058552,RPW,2020-04-01 15:29:00,24,"Hello All, Not sure if it will make a difference or not, but I've started a petition to allow boat launches open for fishermen - it is worth a try! Please show your support by Signing and Sharing! Petition to Doug Ford: Ontario Boat Launches Open to Fishermen."
1058561,Big Cliff,2020-04-01 16:43:00,6899,NOT A CHANCE! This defeats the STAY AT HOME so this virus doesn't spread. There will be lots of time for fishing once this is over (for those that survive it)
1058563,Terry,2020-04-01 16:48:00,14456,But me going down the road and putting my boat into the water and fishing by myself is a lot safer then going to the liquor store.   Both being an addiction
1058567,RPW,2020-04-01 16:55:00,24,"You're definitely entitled to your opinion - but I don't see how jumping in your own boat, alone or with a family member from the same household, and going out on the water to fish is spreading the virus. I don't see how prohibiting this is, in any way, beneficial. Creating new (temporary) rules and regulations prohibiting multiple people, or people outside of your family from fishing together is more reasonable and understandable. I actually see this is counterproductive as the alternative is to stay in your house and do nothing at all? Drink? Eat? Sleep? How is this beneficial to our health?"
1058568,LefroyFisherman,2020-04-01 16:55:00,602,"I'm kinda on the fence with the boat launches and fishing thing, I understand how they want to limit contact. But I just read a good comment on the fishing petition, one lady said that her husband fishes a lot during the year and they depend on the food that he brings home. There are a few good points in that petition also."
1059130,chris.brock,2020-04-07 00:14:00,4053,"I went ice fishing to a back lake with a friend a couple days ago. We both agreed to keep our distance and did, but there was definitely a chance for transmission. We shared 1 axe (auger), minnow bucket, ladle (scoop), I borrowed a hook, we passed close to each other a few times on the trail and around the campfire. I don't like rules, but to help the politicians mitigate the problem they created out of ineptitude and incompetence, I'm going solo until this pandemic subsides   "
1059166,NAW,2020-04-07 16:41:00,4022,"I went camping this past weekend.  My GF and I.   And we where joined by a very close couple to us.  Basically family.  Drove up in separate vehicles.   Obviously had separate canoes.   Separate tents, chairs, etc...   We did a pretty good job at social distancing really.  The only thing that we did that was ""bad"" was play a game of cards.  I normally don't go camping this early.  But I honestly think they will close or restrict all crown land for the summer and start ticketing everyone they see with a canoe on their car roof.  So I wanted to get a camp in before that insanity starts!!"
1059286,glen,2020-04-09 11:32:00,2641,It’s odd that they wouldn’t stop the virus from flying in to Canada but they will stop you from going out of your house.
1059287,Terry,2020-04-09 11:38:00,14456,Watch out for people speaking moistly
1059288,lew,2020-04-09 11:40:00,12766,"Nobody is stopping you from going out of your house, they're just telling you to be sensible about it."
1059291,glen,2020-04-09 12:14:00,2641,i went to the grocery store parking lot and sat there for an hour. I didn’t leave my car.    I watched the people coming to get food.   	  Don’t worry the virus is going to keep spreading.
1059300,RPW,2020-04-09 13:09:00,24,An interesting read... https://www.thecollegefix.com/epidemiologist-coronavirus-could-be-exterminated-if-lockdowns-were-lifted/?fbclid=IwAR20QdNDfblDXR017NCSNQfpxtqDhoafElFOYXxYRhDD_AH0SfIoqFJ3YS8
