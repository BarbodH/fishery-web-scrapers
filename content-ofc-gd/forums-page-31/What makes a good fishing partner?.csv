1059928,Terry,2020-04-15 19:48:00,14456,Here
1059939,irishfield,2020-04-15 21:25:00,26272,Someone that doesn't mind Musky fishing in December !  
1059940,mukluk,2020-04-15 22:01:00,196,I have to agree Cliff. I'm 74 years of age as well. Maybe I could do the breast stroke with her to keep me on top of the water should the boat capsize.
1059942,AKRISONER,2020-04-15 22:13:00,5558,Sounds like you guys all want a fishing partner with a pair¬†of D....cell batteries to use for your fishing scale
1059945,Terry,2020-04-15 22:32:00,14456,I just want one that isn‚Äôt coughing and isn‚Äôt in my face.
1059950,irishfield,2020-04-15 22:46:00,26272,"No ""want"".. I already have mine! Thanks!"
1059953,wkrp,2020-04-15 23:12:00,656,A fishing partner that isn't on the cell phone all day talking to his wife and family members
1059979,AKRISONER,2020-04-16 12:19:00,5558,"One of my tournament partners does this, but worse he always talks on speakerphone so that he can continue fishing. I used to listen to him talk to his girlfriend for an hour at a time about drama with her friends, listen to her complain about work etc etc¬†on speakerphone in the middle of tournaments. Luckily they broke up lol, but not sure if it‚Äôd be much of the same with his new GF lol"
1059981,dave524,2020-04-16 12:25:00,4508,"OK if it was his boat, your boat , you're the captain."
1060176,Bill,2020-04-17 23:47:00,140,I like taking a person who enjoys catching whatever fish hits. My wife does this very well.
1060204,canoecarrier,2020-04-18 11:21:00,54,Reliability is most important! I once had a buddy that would bail out often or just go home when the bite got slow. He once called his buddy as soon as I caught a rainbow and told him what lake it was on! Needless to say had enough of that!
1060212,Steve Piggott,2020-04-18 12:50:00,196,"A good fishing partner is someone who knows how to get the boat ready at the launch. Ropes, bumpers , plugs . Can back up truck and trailer if needed. Funny,good conversation. Knows how to work a fish finders . Has good fishing knowledge . With all this being said, looks like I will be fishing by myself."
1060218,turtle,2020-04-18 14:04:00,274,"You don't have to ask/tell a good partner to do something because they've already did it.¬† I used to fish with a friend who'd stand around on the boat launch with his hands in his pockets until you told him what to do.¬† Partly due to inexperience at first.¬† A good partner knows weather, boating safety and has some mechanical ability because I have little.¬† A good partner doesn't wave the net at fish. "
1060353,Reelpro,2020-04-20 18:51:00,73,"You need to teach him what an ""Aquashit"" is all about. I had a client with 3 ten yr¬†¬†olds a few yrs¬†back, we where fishing near a marina for a few hrs caught some bass then decided to go catch some walleye further out in the lake. I asked the boys if anyone needed a washroom break -¬†nope - 15¬†minute boat ride later we get out to the spot and one of the boys says Dad I need to go to the bathroom. Dad says pee over the side or use the pee bucket - but Dad I got to take a crap. Well son Dad says it's time you learned all about an Aquashit. Good thing it was July and water was warm, ¬†Dad tells the boy to strip and jump off the back then hang on to the ladder and ""just pinch it out son"". Of course the other 2 boys leaned over the outboard to watch and give us the play by play action - ooh it's floating -ick hahaha We were all laughing our ass off except of course Aquashit boy wasn't overly thrilled with us. we sacrificed a small hand towel and started catching walleye Next time your with your buddy teach him about an Aquashit cheers  "
1060364,irishfield,2020-04-20 21:10:00,26272,Hope you ate the fish you caught too...
1060367,Reelpro,2020-04-20 21:27:00,73,We made sure to move to the other side of the shoal and watched for floaters ü§™
1060371,Rizzo,2020-04-20 22:42:00,4754,"don't you worry. the one time I did make him do the ""aquadump"". Unfortunately he was right beside the transducer and I caught the whole event on the humminbird"
1057939,LostAnotherOne,2020-03-25 01:29:00,956,With me it's someone who knows how to use the net.¬† It would be a nightmare for me if I finally get a fifty incher on the side of the boat and they screw up.
1057947,John Bacon,2020-03-25 02:41:00,3277,Someone that always stays at least six feet away from you... 
1057949,misfish,2020-03-25 09:32:00,29133,"That is what the bow and the stern are for,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"
1057950,Fish Farmer,2020-03-25 10:20:00,2234,Someone that doesn't mind fishing 10-12 hours in the boat before going in.
1057951,Big Cliff,2020-03-25 10:35:00,6899,"Well I have been very fortunate to have had (and still do have) many wonderful fishing partners but the best one was my brother in law Herb. Herb was a lousy fisherman, not very good on the net, but he let me sleep with his sister üòÅ"
1057957,Beans,2020-03-25 12:23:00,3339,Good one Cliff...LMAO!
1057969,gordy28,2020-03-25 13:19:00,638,For me I would say someone who doesn't mind conversation and excitement I talk a lot and when a fish is on the line I tend to get hyper and yell a lot 
1057979,vance,2020-03-25 14:33:00,719,Some one who DOESN'T wear crack pants.
1057981,LeXXington,2020-03-25 14:47:00,1928,"Reliability.¬† Be on time, don't cancel at the very last min.¬† So far my dog has never let me down"
1057982,Terry,2020-03-25 14:56:00,14456,"Yup nothing worst then sitting at the parking¬†lot waiting¬†for your fishing partner¬†to show up only to¬†get a text message he‚Äôs not coming ¬†,even 10 o‚Äôclock the night before sucks also a guy who bugged me to¬†take him fishing¬†showing up with his 9 year old daughter without telling me she was coming "
1057987,OhioFisherman,2020-03-25 15:41:00,6623,"Years ago one of the guys in our bass club asked me to fish a tournament series here as his partner. Never had fished with him except a couple of late evenings while at one of our tournaments in New York. Those could be like family gatherings, a number of us took vacation time, rented a cabin or trailer, and brought the wife and kids along. I had actually met him and learned of the bass club thru his mother in law who was one of my customers. First tournament, no problem, second tournament, no show. About 10 am his wife calls the house, Paul? yep, aren't you fishing? nope your dude didn't show! She was calling my wife to see if she wanted to have a cook out ready when we got home. Never talked to the dude again, he was shacked up somewhere. "
1057990,misfish,2020-03-25 15:59:00,29133,"I always tell them, meet ya at the spot . I do not wait . If I am invited , I am always early . Problem is,I am waiting . It feels like I missed half the morning already out there .LOL"
1058001,Old Ironmaker,2020-03-25 19:16:00,8243,My best fishing partner is someone that knows what they are doing without my help. Someone that I will talk their ear off and not vocalize their frustration for being cut off in mid sentence. My absolute best fishing partner ever was the one that doesn't mind putting up with me for a few hours on the boat then at the end of the day lets me sleep with her.
1058016,Rizzo,2020-03-25 21:55:00,4754,someone who doesn't have to go poop 15 minutes after we start. Got a buddy like clock-work...gotta take a dump as soon as we get to the first spot.
