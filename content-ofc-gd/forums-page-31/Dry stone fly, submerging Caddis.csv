1058698,AKRISONER,2020-04-02 16:37:00,5558,"dude, i need to go fly fishing with you one day. I have quite literally never fly fished with anyone that knows what the hell they are doing, ive had to learn everything entirely on my own and I know that I am 100% missing a lot of the puzzle pieces when it comes to fly selection and presenting submerged flies in rivers. These are unreal by the way. "
1058701,misfish,2020-04-02 16:43:00,29133,"Thanks  I am self taught . Just grabbed a fly rod one day and went out . I am no expert trust me , but you tube is my friend ."
1058717,misfish,2020-04-02 19:13:00,29133,Wheres that Christopher kid when you need him ? LOL  Hope he is doing well .

1058739,misfish,2020-04-02 21:49:00,29133,Thanks  Are you a stalker ? LOL 
1058740,misfish,2020-04-02 21:52:00,29133,"Oh and I put the mallard wing casing wrong . Should of been up, not down . Got to tie new ones now . I guess the ones I have now will be sleeping, the new ones,ready to fly . LOL"
1058770,Garnet,2020-04-03 10:58:00,2056,I tie balanced fly's for float fishing. My fun is taking idea and developing something new. The funny things is when I was happy to get thread feathers on a hook they still worked. Most of my early attempts looked like a horse walked on them and a dog pooped them out still worked.
1058793,AKRISONER,2020-04-03 13:56:00,5558,"Too much of fly fishing content is from guys in mountains that have big roaring rivers with a kilometer of space to false cast. Or even worse..spey lol Definitely nowhere near as much content of guys fishing steel in densely forested creeks. Some of the indicator stuff is useful, but at the same time I need someone to watch what the heck I am doing and tell me whether what I am doing is right or not lol. Then youve got guys that swing streamers for salmon and I think I know how to do it, but ive never had any luck at all doing it so I must be doing something totally wrong. The only way Ive caught salmon is nymphing roe patterns.  Lets face it I suck and i need help lol!"
1058797,misfish,2020-04-03 14:34:00,29133,"Like Spiel & Bill M would say , if the stream is that tight, use a UL spinning set up.LOL I have 3  river/creek systems I can swing but majority of the time I am roll casting . If you want wide open, fish the grand river . Looking like I will not get there til fall this year. I hope anyways."
1058799,Garnet,2020-04-03 15:02:00,2056,you can substitute indicator for float just watch the real fly guys die 100 deaths. Tie a balanced fly (YouTube balanced fly) and your indicator success will go up.

1058955,misfish,2020-04-04 22:36:00,29133,Tiny midge fly day . The head on the pin is 5mm to show the size of the fly . Mag light  is some friend I tell ya . Will make wing case ones next .    
1058976,AKRISONER,2020-04-05 02:17:00,5558,"Meh, I’ve never been a purist. I’m a friggin bass fisherman lol. its good enough that I know how to double haul and roll cast (although poorly) lol ive got floats but I’m certain that my presentation is totally wrong when fishing submerged flies under it. My fly selection is probably wrong and my cast location in relation to the water is also probably incorrect. the one helpful thing in all of this is I’ve devoted 100% of my dock fishing at the lake to fly fishing so it gives me lots of opportunity to practice casting but without the boring of doing it without any opportunity to catch fish. Pike sure friggin like white streamers!"
