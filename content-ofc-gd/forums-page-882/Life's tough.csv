They all gathered around the surgery table with the body covered with a white sheet. The professor started the class by telling them, 'In Veterinary Medicine it is necessary to have two important qualities as a doctor: The first is that you not be disgusted by anything involving the animal body.' For an example, the Professor pulled back the sheet, stuck his finger in the butt of the dead cow, withdrew it and stuck his finger in his mouth.  'Go ahead and do the same thing,' he told his students. The students freaked out, hesitated for several minutes, but eventually took turns sticking a finger in the anal opening of the dead cow and sucking on it.  When everyone finished, the Professor looked at them and said, 'The second most important quality is observation. I stuck in my middle finger but I sucked on my index finger. Now learn to pay attention. Life's tough; it's even tougher if you're stupid.'"

317305,theRJ,2009-03-14 16:41:00,55,"Observation is always important. I pay attention in class and carefully watch the Prof teach our lessons. Shockingly I understand things! And I often find myself sitting in class listening to people ask annoying questions that they wouldn't have needed to ask if they had been paying attention.  I'll have to remember something like this when I start TA'ing next year MWAHAHAHAHA!!!! Don't worry though, the worst case is they suck my Asphalt.  RJ"
