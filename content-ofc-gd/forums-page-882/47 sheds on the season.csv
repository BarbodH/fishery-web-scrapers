317655,Daplumma,2009-03-15 21:09:00,1961,"Here is one of the bigger ones I found.  Same shed..the pooch is 85lbs.  another of my girl with a few ""trophies"".She loves to chew on them.  Joe"
317664,centerpin_drift,2009-03-15 21:37:00,94,"  Glad to see ya got out for a walk with the mrs, misfish!  I was out today for a few hours with the pooch scouring cornfields and fence crossings, but didn't find a thing.  thats just the way shed hunting goes sometimes.   And thanks joe for the pictures of your dog with some sheds,  Looks just like my little fella.  That shed in the top picture is defintally a nice buck, any luck on finding the other side?"
317675,Daplumma,2009-03-15 21:50:00,1961,"I bowhunted that buck for two years,saw him 6 times but never got a shot at him.I have the same shed from a year before but never found the other side.I sent a pm with some more pup pics. Joe"
317681,misfish,2009-03-15 22:10:00,29133,"Is that one of them poodle/lab cross Joe?   We,ll be out again next weekend ,different area.This place they yard,so maybe our luck will change."
317696,misfish,2009-03-15 22:28:00,29133,Found this great site on DEER
317032,centerpin_drift,2009-03-13 22:02:00,94,"well folks, its that time of year again, the snow is melting making it possible to get into the woods and track the deer that eluded me during bow season.  Looking for something to do with the kids this weekend? Or just want to get out and get some exercise?  Hit your nearest deer woods and keep your eyes on the ground.  So far ive found 47 sheds this season, including the racks from a few bucks i stalked all bow season and never got a crack at, just thought i would share some of my nicer finds;                               "
317034,Beats,2009-03-13 22:12:00,543,"Wow, that's insane.   I've never found one myself."
317039,Leecher,2009-03-13 22:21:00,7832,WOW.... there must be a good population of mature bucks in your area to find all those sheds    Beauty    I've never found one either   Question: Do you use the sheds for rattling while bow hunting??  Thanks for posting all those Leechman
317040,mjack 7,2009-03-13 22:28:00,22,"If you want to check out a good site with a load of really monster sheds check out gussyoutdoors.com, The fishing and hunting pics are just OK. LOL  It's work the view.  Sorry gussy"
317041,centerpin_drift,2009-03-13 22:29:00,94,"Leechman,  I do indeed use antlers for rattling while i bowhunt, and let me tell you the results are explosive.  Ive done everything from hard rattling to light tickling and had bucks charge in my direction faster than i could get by release clipped on the string.  This year i tagged one of my bucks by rattling him in, and the other i tagged grunting and rattling him, shooting both bucks within 6 yards.  Some people strongly disagree with rattling, such as my hunting buddy, but i never leave home without them during bow season.  Mike"
317045,Leecher,2009-03-13 22:37:00,7832, Great Mike       6 yards    that's pretty close..... doesn't leave you with much time for decision making LOL  Are you in a tree stand or on the ground when you do this?? Jacques
317052,trapshooter,2009-03-13 22:54:00,1234,That's awesome.  Something I want to try this year for sure.
317067,richyb,2009-03-13 23:22:00,774,"Nice sheds , I like that split brow tine antler. The non typical stuff gets me goin. I have never had much luck rattling, but I keep trying. I do my shed hunting while im pre season scouting for turkeys.  Just think , chances are those bucks will be bigger this fall for you to chase."
317166,Maverick,2009-03-14 02:39:00,371,"Nice, are those the apple orchards on the way to Blue Mountain?"
317187,Paully,2009-03-14 03:18:00,712,Thats awsome how you find so many.......
317191,centerpin_drift,2009-03-14 03:27:00,94,"Maverick, they are all found in orchards in heathcote and thornbury."
317211,Hooked,2009-03-14 04:13:00,891,"Is there a market for them?  I have seen buck knives handles made of a part of the antler, but are there any other uses for them beside that and rattling?  Just curious is all.  Personally I would love to come across one of them.  Anyways, nice pics."
317226,Maverick,2009-03-14 06:20:00,371,"Looked familiar and saw where you were from, I spent a summer up at Blue Mountain and there were tons of orchards all around there. Must be great places for deer for sure."
317237,Guest gbfisher,2009-03-14 12:27:00,0,Ya dont have to go far. Close to the city usually gets some big Horns. Where they are not hunted and can really grow. A friend of mine over by the credit picks them up while walking his dogs as well. I think he has found 20 or so this year. Great Bigguns!!....To bad ya can't Bow hunt for them....lol
317246,Daplumma,2009-03-14 12:54:00,1961,"Very nice,I have found some monster sheds in woodlots around neighborhoods that wont let us in to bowhunt.Tell me more about that dog of yours. Joe"
317248,oxcowboy,2009-03-14 12:57:00,544,"wow, thats simply amazing !  I have only found 1 shed and 7 pt carcass all spring.  great job.  jason"
317249,TerryC,2009-03-14 13:00:00,196,Exactly how hard do you have to swing a crutch to knock the antlers off a passing Buck?   LOL
317258,family guy,2009-03-14 13:42:00,22,"Nice!  Never found one myself, but I'll be keeping a better eye around some of the small streams this spring."
317262,lunkerbasshunter,2009-03-14 14:02:00,2585,very cool for sure!  thanks for the pics  cheers!
317309,centerpin_drift,2009-03-14 16:50:00,94,"  There is a big market for any kind of antler art, infact ive sold quite a few pieces.  I make everything from knives, coat/hat racks, and desk pieces, and currently working on making some prety cool lamps.  Some of it I sell, some i make for myself;  here are a few pieces ive been working on the past couple weeks      hat rack  "
317402,misfish,2009-03-14 23:39:00,29133,"Were heading out in the AM for a walk and see what we can find.Last spring we found just the butt end of a shed,but it was real thick. Great find."
317433,tinbanger,2009-03-15 01:08:00,1028,found a couple behind the house several years back before all the houses went up. find the odd one at our deer camp but most of them are pretty chewed up.  amazing how many you have found.  tb
317516,Hooked,2009-03-15 04:27:00,891,Very cool creations you made there centerpin_drift.
317590,JohnAB,2009-03-15 17:27:00,178,Good job on the shed hunting. Some of those are going to be dandies this fall.
317628,misfish,2009-03-15 19:43:00,29133,2 hour walk this mornin and not one shed.We didnt walk the corn field as it was pretty soft and the mrs was with me.She did enjoy the walk in th bush though.Did see lots of deer and turkeys today.This warming up sure had tem out and about.The spring turkey hunt should be a good one.
