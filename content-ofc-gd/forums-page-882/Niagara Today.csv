317171,jwl,2009-03-14 02:46:00,1056,"Set out to do some shore trashin today..ended up running into a couple good fishin buds and fellow nut job steelie anglers just about to head out in the boat.    I was about to make some tracks to a quieter area on acount of the crowd that was already there, and low and behold, got an un expected invite out in the boat to join them for the day.    Good thing I always throw the floater jacket in  with me  Water is less than perfect...about the tannish colour of a cardboard box for lack of a better term  We worked the crap out of one small area that's been putting out a few when the conditions are off.  Took a while to find the right colour pattern to use for the day but all in all dispite the ice in the morning( spot was making ice as we fished  ) and the less than a foot viz of brown water, we winded up going 8 for 12 for the day......this 4 is the contribution I made to the 8  I just noticed the ""money shot"" on the smaller one   chicka..chicka...wahhh...wahh...say hello to Uncle Milty!    "
317176,BillM,2009-03-14 02:51:00,17367,"Jack, I still wanna tie into one of those Niagara river monsters!!   Good job!!"
317178,Joeytier,2009-03-14 02:58:00,3990,Some real monsters there!  I'm gonna try my best to get down there sometime this week.
317180,Greencoachdog,2009-03-14 03:01:00,8163, That's gonna cost ya ten and twenty Jack!!!
317183,Paully,2009-03-14 03:08:00,712,Way to go Jwl ... You sure know your stuff!
317240,bigugli,2009-03-14 12:32:00,6138,WTG Jack. Some fine looking fish there.
317251,TerryC,2009-03-14 13:03:00,196,"Sweet lookin steel, good job.  Clarence"
317266,smokin joe,2009-03-14 14:06:00,226,"Very nicely done Jack, those are some beauties.  Way to go man.  I have a strong feeling that the rest of the ice bridge up at the falls will be breaking up this weekend which will send more ice down that way, then it should be smooth sailing after that."
317274,Joey,2009-03-14 14:54:00,9122,"Super report Jack, I'm glad you got a chance to fish from a boat and got into some nice fish too. Doncha just hate when you catch a fish as soon as you light up a smoke  Joey"
317289,mikeh,2009-03-14 15:40:00,824,"That last fish looks pretty long , did you get a measurement on it? , congrats."
317291,JeffBornFishin,2009-03-14 15:41:00,260,Very nice!
317292,NAC,2009-03-14 15:54:00,369,did the first three come on that one cigarette Jack?  Nice job!
317313,jwl,2009-03-14 17:08:00,1056," no but the middle 2 did   , started the drift, I got one, we did the CPR,I was manning the electric motor for my buddy, so after I got the boat straightened out again and put my line back in because we still had about 1/2 the drift left we could fish, then I got the other one.  It started off a little slow becasue of the muddy conditions, but once we threw a pattern on the fish we had some decent action for a while, my buddy lost 2 that where well into the teens  I didn't throw a measurement on the fish although it was longer than the one I have entered for Team#1, we where in my buddy's small boat, I set out to do some shore trashin and got an invite to hop aboard so there was 3 of us in the boat, not much room for getting all fancy with tapemeasures and such  I will get a bigger one by the end of the tourney anyways"
317322,RuNnYoOzE,2009-03-14 18:31:00,270,wow random to get an invite on a boat! woot what a great day. I have never fished from a boat but it sounds fun ..no casting every 2 seconds just let the boat do the work  I guess I'll find out 1 day!

And Cliff, yepper as for the last minute invite to pop on my buddy's boat, I was happy to take it, haven't been able to get mine out for like 2 weeks, our van was in the shop cuz someone decided they wanted to crash into my wife and pay for some body work on my van    and I been waiting for a nice day to change one of my rims and tires on my boat trailer, last time out I got a ding in a rim and now it has a slow leak"
317462,bigugli,2009-03-15 01:55:00,6138, At least the other guy is footing the bill eh?  Good you got out all the same.
