There is a grease fitting on the cable housing that will not accept grease, it will be replaced soon. Any ideas??"

I wish you luck on freeing it but things don't last forever when there is wind and water and cold temperatures involved,"

It gave us no warning that this was going to happen. We had to be towed about 5 or 6 miles into Bluffers. Thank goodness for VHF radio and GPS co-ordinates. I ended up replaceing the cable and buying dinner and and a box of beer for the crew who towed us in. The fishing was great that day and those guys broke it off to come to our rescue. Don't try and fix it, bite the bullet and replace it now."
