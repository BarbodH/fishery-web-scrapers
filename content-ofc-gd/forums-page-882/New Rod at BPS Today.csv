It was only 24.99 so I couldn't pass it up. It is the yellow one in case you're wondering. What situations should I use it?  Thanks  Curt"

317204,nancur373,2009-03-14 03:59:00,1211,"that's what I was sorta thinking. Wow would it work for smaiiles? with it being a 7'6"" I think it would handle it."
317208,richyb,2009-03-14 04:05:00,774,"Use it for everything you want , try it out for diferent situations. I have got 20 pound carp on a 5'6 UL.  I bet that would be a great panfish rod."
317209,Cudz,2009-03-14 04:09:00,2652,throw small crakbaits with it for smallies.  For sure.  I drop shotted with a 5'6 UL this fall and hooked up and landed a 3 pound smallie.  It was fun and I didn't feel the fish was too much for the rod.
