317064,rhare,2009-03-13 23:17:00,387,"Even though it was a bad luck day I decided to hit the lake with some friends and see if I could get them into some fish. We fished the north shore of kemp and started in 85fow. The fish started off aggressive eagerly ripping off bottom after our tubes. After a couple hours and a some fish landed action slowed. Steve and I met up with his dad and decided to move out to 95ft and see if we could find some more active fish. We set his dad up showed him a few tips and he was into fish in no time. Steve and I fished together and managed a few more. Again action slowed so we headed in and stopped in one more spot in 72fow, marked a few fish and I managed one more but we paked it up after 15 mins and called it a day. I iced 7, steve iced 6 and everyone else got into some fish. All and all not bad for a slow day. With the way the weather is shaping up this final weekend is going to be killer. get out there and get em'  tightlines  Ryan Hare  kevin doing battle, well his dad looks on    The catch    Steve with one   A wee one for me   Jesse doing battle for the crowd   What blood ?
