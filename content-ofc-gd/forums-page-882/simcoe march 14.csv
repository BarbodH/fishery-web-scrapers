317414,12footspringbok,2009-03-15 00:25:00,459,Well headed out of bbp on simcoe today. Tried a few different depths from 65-110ft marked quite a few fish at all locations. Moved one last time around 11 and found some active whities. Between 11:30 and 1:00 i iced three and lost several others. Quite a nice day out there. Had to cross a few pressure cracks to get out the but the were fairly solid and we had no real issues. Gonna give it one last try tomorrow.
