316940,fishnsled,2009-03-13 16:54:00,3520,"I was going to say I'd take a couple till I saw this.      What the heck, I'll take a couple if we can get enough interest."
316941,capt bruce,2009-03-13 16:54:00,820,"Terry ya kill me bro , i spit coffee a good 10 feet , AHHHHHH!!!!!"
316942,Peps,2009-03-13 17:00:00,191,I'm down for a couple atleast
317020,Terry,2009-03-13 21:25:00,14456,yeah we don't want to scare the fish    
317199,johnnyb,2009-03-14 03:47:00,3413,I'm definitely in....awaiting the sign-up thread...
317202,Joeytier,2009-03-14 03:56:00,3990,"As previously stated, if there is a paypal option, I'm definitely down for one or two."
317314,TJQ,2009-03-14 17:08:00,7806,"LOL..sorry I haven't piped in yet... This last week was so busy.. i havent had much time to look at the board!!  Let me give some thought on this, like whats been mentioned, its a ton of work and cost to redistribute stuff like this, only to make a buck or two, plus everything would have to be preordered AND paid for.. LOL.. I still have boat flags from two years ago.  I do have an idea though!!  Ill run it by the mods, and I think it will suit everyone.  Give me a day or two to get the board of directors approval!!  LOL..  Terry... nice job..  im quite flattered!!"
317337,Lunker777,2009-03-14 20:43:00,866,"I would be in forsure !!!! Anything to help OFC...thats a great idea to help support the site.. would it be possible to get ""clackin raps"" ?  The paypal idea is grea too !!!"
317344,kickingfrog,2009-03-14 21:14:00,8333,"  And to play on a quote from Rick Mercer on the Mercer Report: ""Relax Steven Harper, I said boat flags.""   I wonder what my potential future grandkids will think of my vintage OFC tackle collection? Hang 'em on the wall? Or sell them at a garage sale in a box of odds and ends... 2 bits for the whole lot?"
317424,danbouck,2009-03-15 00:51:00,4380,I'd be in for a few!
316513,bicephalic,2009-03-12 19:10:00,112,So looks like we'd need 500 minimum order...but I'd certainly be down to buy a few if they were in black and gold or black and white Anyone else in? http://www.rapala.com/offers/logo_lure.cfm
316516,walleyejigger,2009-03-12 19:19:00,876,"i'd be in for a couple, at a reasonable price that is"
316520,capt bruce,2009-03-12 19:26:00,820,"Sounds like a great idea ,Id buy a few"
316532,solopaddler,2009-03-12 19:46:00,8605,Shad Raps and I'd be in for a couple dozen.
316539,Handlebarz,2009-03-12 19:58:00,3790,I would also be in for some but I think all $$$ would have to be pre paid to Tj to cover the cost that way he is not stuck for the rest again
316544,capt bruce,2009-03-12 20:08:00,820,We were talking about ways to make donations to the site and I think this is a great way 500 OFC rapallas we pay a dollar more to TJ site gets 500 dollars and we all get an OFC lure .. But instead of rapalas shouldnt they be JUMLAS
316547,SNAGKING,2009-03-12 20:13:00,43,Depending on the color I'm down for a few as well.
316553,misfish,2009-03-12 20:30:00,29133, Great idea Bruce.  I be in for a few myself.
316554,ozaibak1,2009-03-12 20:31:00,401,"I'm sure with the enthusiasm and amount of people on this site, it could be used as a really good wholesale distribution channel! If we can setup some sort of online payment system for this kind of stuff, the benefits to the users and people running the site could be huge!"
316571,ozaibak1,2009-03-12 21:00:00,401,I'd be in for 2.
316580,ColdH20guy,2009-03-12 21:27:00,312,good idea..would Paypal work on here?
316583,kickingfrog,2009-03-12 21:33:00,8333,"What's with this small time stuff???  Lets go all out. I say we get Super shads with TJ's face on the head of the bait.   I'm sure someone could photo shop up a proto-type.                ....or not, I'm in for a couple then."
316587,Maverick,2009-03-12 21:41:00,371,If you can pay through paypal and they are reasonably priced i would take 3-4
316594,Terry,2009-03-12 21:54:00,14456,
316597,walleyejigger,2009-03-12 21:55:00,876,"AHHHHHHHHH, i retract my order"
316599,ColdH20guy,2009-03-12 21:57:00,312,good job Terry! good thing you didnt fill in the rest!
316607,Dan668,2009-03-12 22:43:00,1120,id take 3-4
316637,kickingfrog,2009-03-12 23:35:00,8333,"Nice Terry. Although I don't think anybody would like what you'd ""catch"" with something like that        ... I'll take a couple."
316639,xeon,2009-03-12 23:55:00,350,Each lure costs $4.25US a peice so about $5.45CAD for a two colour lure. So basically you would need $2725CAD to cover the costs. Plus shipping. I also dont think you get to choose a colour other than the Red and White or Black Pearl. I personally dont fish either colour so it would be a novelty item to me.
316713,Zubris21,2009-03-13 01:52:00,563,I'd be interested in a couple perhaps.
316737,Gerritt,2009-03-13 02:35:00,6129,yup I am down for a few...
316778,gone_fishin,2009-03-13 04:26:00,481,"i'm in, for sure! that would be awesome!!!"
316782,Dnthmn,2009-03-13 04:58:00,128,"I'd be in for a couple especially if it helps to support the site.  Being a bit of a newb, if the idea has already been mentioned please disregard, what about an OFC Magazine to help support the site as well. Articles contributed by the members and published into a periodical might not be a bad idea. I know there is a ton of knowledge that is present on this board. Why not capitalize on it?"
316834,Victor,2009-03-13 13:12:00,1609," we do have an e-magazine.  I'd be down for a few OFC lures too, only thing to consider is that it's probably alot of work for TJ to take care of the shipping ..."
316937,legacey,2009-03-13 16:50:00,127,I'd be willing to buy a few too.....if it were an easy process like pay pal.  cheers
