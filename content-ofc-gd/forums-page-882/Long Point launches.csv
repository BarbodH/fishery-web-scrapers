317487,The Urban Fisherman,2009-03-15 02:36:00,2050,"Hey guys my wife's grandmother lives on the bay and says its wide open with a few straggler chunks of ice here and there, so with tomorrow's prime weather I can't pass up the chance to kick off my softwater season with some ice out pike and maybe some perch or crappie.  I had planned to run down and check the launches today but by the time I did a few things for the wife, summerized the boat and dusted off my gear it was to late!  Anybody happen to know which launches are clear of ice? I usually launch @ akers.  Had my helper on hand with the boat and gear!   All set and ready to go!!! CAN'T WAIT! I'm barely going to be able to sleep tonight!   Thanks a lot for any info, hopefully ill have a report!  Cheers, Uf"
