316975,Jeff Wiles,2009-03-13 19:06:00,55,My little guy and I are going to try and find some crappies this after noon. Any one else looking yet.  :rolleyes:   Jeff
316990,ozaibak1,2009-03-13 19:55:00,401,"Not yet, I may start targeting them next weekend however."
317077,ld17,2009-03-13 23:41:00,319,to early I think.  I'm waiting a few weeks
317385,endless,2009-03-14 22:59:00,27,"are you guys going for them through the ice, or in small areas of water that's begun to open up in marinas or bays or something?  I'd like to try this year, and have a lake in mind.  I just need to know what parts of the lake to target, and what kind of bait works the best.  I've heard using really small jigs under a bobber is okay?  any suggestions?"
317779,ld17,2009-03-16 00:22:00,319,"I've caught them through the ice no problem.  I've tried right as the ice starts to melt in some back bays and cuts.  I don't catch any this early.  Their not in the shallows enough.  Still staging just outside the bay in deeper water so it's hard to get the bait to them cause the farther you want to move out there is still ice so you can't get your bait down.  Where the ice is gone closer to shore, their not there yet so you have to wait a bit loner.  Then they move in and easy pickings."
