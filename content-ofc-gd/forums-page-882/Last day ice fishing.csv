It worked amazing, you can actually see the fish come up and grab a minnow on your hook. Our final result was around 100 pearch. We kept maybe about 50 to bring home and the rest we put back  It steady most of the day. We had a fish every few minutess and some times in a matter of 5 minutes we had around 10 pearch. We decided to pack up around 3:00 PM after the fishing slowed down. We followed our tracks back but at the shore line with our ATV and we had to give it full gas to get threw about 2 feet of slusshy water.  I took some pics but I cant upload them (too big). Here is a video of my dad catching one of his many perch.      Thanks for watching and Dad thanks for taking the day off work to take me fishing"
