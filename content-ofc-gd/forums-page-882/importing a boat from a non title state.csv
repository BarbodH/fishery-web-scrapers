317352,mikeh,2009-03-14 21:41:00,824,WHAT STATE?
317355,BillM,2009-03-14 21:48:00,17367,"All you need is a bill of sale, a title isn't required...  If it was built in the US, Canada or Mexico you won't pay duty..  File you customs papers, once you get them back take those to Transport Canada and you'll get everything you need."
317365,magicfingers,2009-03-14 22:10:00,37,thanks for the info.I have imported 2 boats but have never imported from a state that has no title.Just wondering how it worked for the trailer as well.notorized bill of sale is good enough? Boat is coming from alabama thanks magic
317371,mikeh,2009-03-14 22:20:00,824,"I imported my boat from Ohio, the boat and motor had separate title papers but they don't have titles for trailers. Trying to explain that to our MOT was a nightmare for a couple of days. I finally had to get a letter from MOT in Ohio stating that they have no titles for trailers and that a bill of sale is all thats required. It had to be on their letterhead."

317460,Sandbag,2009-03-15 01:54:00,533,"Magicfingers  I'm not sure about boats, but I know people that have attended the  snowmobile auctions in Michigan earlier this year.  The auction house has signs up telling Canadian buyers to only purchase the sleds with title and not the ""bill of sale"" only sleds.  Worth a call to Customs before making the trip to save you some agro on the way back.  Cheers  Craig"

Thanks for the replies. now only 30t hours of driving to get this thing home
