316899,stan_133,2009-03-13 14:49:00,77,i'm sure you could make some money off an idea like that.
317029,Radnine,2009-03-13 21:52:00,1538," Throw a camo tarp over that and you've got a blind (ice fishing hut, tent, whatever). Nice use of transferable skills. Jim"

316406,blaque,2009-03-12 14:56:00,2419,"Thats awesome, its amazing the possibilities a welder opens up aint it.  We have welders at work and i find myself staying late alot to make all kinds of fun stuff that would otherwise cost me a fortune.  Take them corners Sloooooooow though lol"

316414,walleyejigger,2009-03-12 15:10:00,876,"excellent set up, i have one myself (store bought though) and love it, don't take it up gravel pits though LOL"
316417,capt bruce,2009-03-12 15:13:00,820,"That is just amazeing got my mind working .

316474,TroutnMuskieHunter,2009-03-12 17:05:00,1362,Looks like a great rack you built there....I've been thinking about building one myself but I'm a little sceptical on the stability ofthe ATV when going over rough terrain...It sure looks top heavy....have you taking this into consideration??
316476,2 tone z71,2009-03-12 17:09:00,1311,"yeah I strapped it down this morning and went for a test,im a big boy and maybe that helps but had no problem with any off camber climbing"
316488,camillj,2009-03-12 17:32:00,1988,"Nice, now all you need is a ramp system to be able to load it yourself (using that front mounted winch you hinted at)  Just add a windshield and a tarp and you have a portable hut for the winter"
316491,JohnAB,2009-03-12 17:41:00,178,Awesome job. Was thinking of something like that for my Big Bear as well.
316528,Terry,2009-03-12 19:35:00,14456,"a lot of trails I went on , that would be way too high for the branches on the trees and it might be way to top heavy for many of the hills I went up and down  but it`s great if it will work on the trails you ride"
316605,2 tone z71,2009-03-12 22:35:00,1311,time will tell Terry may be in for some hairy rides
316615,Muskieman,2009-03-12 22:56:00,2472,That's Cool!!!!  I guess ya just gotta flip it upside down and put the out board on it and you're good to go..     Great Job!  RFS 
316616,pike slayer,2009-03-12 22:57:00,1177,"i was thinking of making one of those to, what did you use to bolt it to the racks? is it a easy put on and take off the 4wheeler, im sure you dont want that on there all the time if you wanted to go for a quad ride with the buds."
316636,2 tone z71,2009-03-12 23:34:00,1311,"I havent permanently secured it yet gotta paint it first ,going either U bolt it or bolt thru,as far as taking it off to go riding theres 2 new bikes in the garage for that ,this is just a yard/plow now backlake bike"
316643,tonka-toy,2009-03-13 00:00:00,139,"Me ,You and Dave all on that .Your dad and Dave's gear on a second one,and away we go!"

316709,tonka-toy,2009-03-13 01:45:00,139,"Sounds great.I wont tell Dave about the cabin,no-one will ever hear from him again."
316775,holdfast,2009-03-13 04:14:00,1813,Love the Rack and the Idea.  Built something out of wood for my pickup.  What I added is a Piece of PVC on the back ramp to act as a roller as I found it easier to roll on then off.  
316844,2 tone z71,2009-03-13 13:34:00,1311,Holdfast thats a great idea I was thinking of slicing up some water pipe last night for the top sections to keep the drag of metal on metal down
316847,The Urban Fisherman,2009-03-13 13:41:00,2050,"Nice Rig dude...I love modifying my toys to.  And by the looks of  things sombeody loves Johnson Motors! lol I see a little 2hp honda in the mix there to! do you have a boat for each motor?!?  cheers, UF"
