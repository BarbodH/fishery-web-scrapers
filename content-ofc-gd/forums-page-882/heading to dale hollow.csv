317243,Greencoachdog,2009-03-14 12:48:00,8163,Sounds like fun Chief!!!  Take a camera and some pics of those beauties!!!

317254,john vail,2009-03-14 13:29:00,67,"Those jigs are called punnishers, but black works good to, popular color is shad."

317558,lunkerbasshunter,2009-03-15 15:07:00,2585,  Yeah im in the beleif that most record fish are Bull.  No pictures or videos with a scale on it i dont believe it.  wish they would start the whole record keeping process over with only legit weighed fish with photo or video evidence. not just the oh yeah it feels like 8 pounds lets call it 11 style of weighing fish back in the 50's lol  cheers!
