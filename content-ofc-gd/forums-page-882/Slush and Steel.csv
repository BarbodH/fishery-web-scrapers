317259,silverstreak,2009-03-14 13:43:00,146,"- 12 degree temps can only mean one thing......slush so I opted to wait for the warmer afternoon to try for some steel. Despite some slush still making it's way downstream and the stained water, one steelie showed me some mercy and hit my black Bunny jig. Thankfully there is no more slush in the forecast. Nice day to finally get out. "
