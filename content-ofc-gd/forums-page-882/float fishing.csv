317320,GBW,2009-03-14 18:10:00,8460,Hey all.  I was wondering if anyone has ever had luck in the tribbs with minnows instead of roe and or worms?  I ask as I have a few preserved pinheads and shinners and I'm just itching to get into my 1st steelhead!  Thanks in advance.  Geoff

As kemper says you might be pleasantly suprised"
