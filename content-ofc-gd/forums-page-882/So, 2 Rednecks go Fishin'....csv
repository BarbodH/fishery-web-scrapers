316932,highdrifter,2009-03-13 16:31:00,2534,Nice one ol budday!
316938,fishnsled,2009-03-13 16:50:00,3520,Always great to get out with a buddy.  I'll be doing it again tomorrow with a few but the water will be much harder. lol!  Thanks for the report.
316948,Billy - Curtiss,2009-03-13 17:26:00,241,Inches for the team? Did you catch them there bad boys in Ontario waters?!    Nice work Glen. Glad to hear you and Lester had a good time together.
316951,capt bruce,2009-03-13 17:33:00,820,"Only thing missing from that first pic is the banjos lol . Good to see a couple of good friends getting in some time together , good friends a boat and a few catfish to catch ,can it get any better (I imagine there might of been a jug or two of some good sipping corn liquor involved allso) winter has gotta end soon"
316970,snag,2009-03-13 18:53:00,1932,  Yeaaaaah.  What's the tourney rules on that?   Good job Red!  Tripod looks a tad heavy though??
317007,Greencoachdog,2009-03-13 20:44:00,8163,"   Weren't y'all s'posed to read the rules before you signed up for the tourney???  The rules state fish caught on your home waters or in Ontario!  I can enter fish I catch in Alabama or Ontario!!!  I cannot enter fish caught in another state or province though... like a trip to Florida or Alberta.   We don't have any Salmonoids here except for a couple creeks that hold itty bitty stocked Rainbows... a 12"" is a whopper!  We don't have any Pike or Musky here!  We don't have any Whitefish here!  We have some Smallmouth in the northwest corner of the state.  We have very few Sauger and Walleye that're like trying to find a needle in 2 haystacks, I've never even seen one that's been caught here... let alone caught one!  That just leaves me Black Bass, Channel Catfish (I can't even enter Blue Cats), and panfish to enter... y'all aint a-skeered of them are you???  ... and y'all wanna bust my nadz aboot entering a Channel Cat kittenfish and a baby Bass???  What am I s'posed to do?... sit here at the puter and ""punish the penguin"" while the rest of my team busts their buns to whip y'alls butt???  I don theen so Queek Straw!"
317095,Mike the Pike,2009-03-14 00:13:00,3421,Thanks for the report there Bubba its nice to see a boat in the water .Oh I just can't wait to wear a little light coat like that .  Right the damp cold weather won't go away.  
317097,ccmtcanada,2009-03-14 00:16:00,7971, Great report Glen!  Yeah...half way thru the report I couldn't figure out who those people were in the pics...then I realized it was just you all dressed up...LOL.  Nothing like fishing with a buddy!
317387,Greencoachdog,2009-03-14 23:01:00,8163, I wear clothes when I have to! (to keep from freezing to death!  )... but that doesn't mean I like it!
316697,Greencoachdog,2009-03-13 01:27:00,8163,"My old buddy Lester was up from Baton Rouge today to pic up his daughter tomorrow for spring break (the joys of being a divorced parent). He called me up last night and asked if I wanted to go fishin' today, my answer was yeah... but Hell Yeah!!!  He's staying with his dad (Dan) that has a nice place on Logan Martin not far from the boat launch that I use. I told him I'd bring my boat up and we'd look for some Crappie... we didn't find any Crappie that were willing to bite, but found some Channel and Blue cats that wanted to play. So that's what we ended up fishing for today.  Remember my high tech tripod?  Well, it takes good buddy pics too!   We didn't really catch anything of any size, but we had a great time catching up and reliving old times!!!  I did manage to get a few more inches for Team #1 Slammers!!!... not big, but inches are inches!  ... an 11 1/2"" Spotted Bass.  This little snot was a Kamikaze! He blasted a minnow on a Sabiki rig that was 8' deep in 30' of water, we had just gone over a hump and had reeled up so not to snag... I was dropping my second line down when he hit the shallow one!  Got a 12 1/2"" Channel cat too!   Like I said, nothing big... but we had a great time!!!  Someone had just built this rather ornate boat shed and I snapped a pic to show:   Here's the days catch:  They did not swim free... Lester sez if they have a pair of eyes, a butthole, and it ate a 10 cent minnow... it's a keeper!  One last pic of my ol' buddy.   As you may be able to tell by our clothes, it was kinda chilly today... but still an excellent day I wouldn't trade for anything!!!"
316700,Pigeontroller,2009-03-13 01:30:00,2793,"Yep, thems rednecks!"
316701,kickingfrog,2009-03-13 01:31:00,8333,I bet Lester is still trying to warm up from Lakair.  Always nice fishin' with a friend.
316704,Roy,2009-03-13 01:37:00,13728,Really glad you had a great time Glen. Nice to see Bubba Lester in good shape too! It's a tremendous feeling to meet up with buds we get along with so well. I'm happy you both had a good day...thanks for sharing that.

316725,MCTFisher9120,2009-03-13 02:16:00,3761,that boat shelter looks like it will become great bass territory.  Great report GCD.
316727,ozaibak1,2009-03-13 02:19:00,401,"Hey GCD, great report! That's not a bad day at all, seems like you always got catfish to fall back on, but that's a really nice bass! Too bad about not hitting the crappie, but I'm sure the next few weeks will bring them on. I've never targeted crappie, but have caught some while nightfishing for bass off docks with good lighting, in the middle of summer. I plan to go all out on them this spring in Ontario soon as ice-out. Always good to be on the water with a friend period! Good stuff."
316729,Sinker,2009-03-13 02:27:00,8692,"There is no better way to spend a day, than fishin with a good buddy!  Fish are just a bonus.......its all about quality time. I get the feeling you's fella's had some catchin up to do out there Glen. By the looks of the smiles, ya's both had a great day!  Thanks for the warm report,  Sinker"
316734,jwl,2009-03-13 02:33:00,1056,"awee..you poor guys had to wear your coats  how many times did you had to chip the ice of the eyes of your rod, or did your bow mount get all flash frozen the first time you took it in and out of the water for the day  way to go for our team GCD  we will soon be hitting the 200 mark...we haven't even got any really big fish on the board yet...and we got some great anglers on the team that know where to find them"
316739,Cudz,2009-03-13 02:40:00,2652,hopin for nudes. lol nice spotted bass (that is what it is isn't it?)
316743,bigugli,2009-03-13 02:43:00,6138,"Nothing like hooking up with a good friend, chewin the fat, and catching a few fish in the bargain."
316757,GBW,2009-03-13 03:27:00,8460,good on ya GCD!  A nice fish is a nice fishi is a fsh...  it's all good...
316764,Joey,2009-03-13 03:47:00,9122,"Great report Glen, glad you and Les had a good time.  I remember that smiling face from last Sept.  Is old Les gonna brave a Lakair June G2G one of these times?  Joey"
316770,holdfast,2009-03-13 03:58:00,1813,"Ahh two good ole Boys.  Like the Jacket.  Too Bad no Crappie pics, but anyhoot the catfish pics are a treat.  Do you eat those things, if so how do you cook Them.  Sometimes I find cats taste good, or Muddy."
316793,Spiel,2009-03-13 10:35:00,9065,"Well I just gots to ask GCD, when is the smilin man from Baton Rouge going to make his first post?"
316808,TroutnMuskieHunter,2009-03-13 11:48:00,1362,Nice report Glen and keep them fish a-comin' for TEAM#1 !!   ....It's always nice to get out with a buddy and spend a day on the water.....I'm doing the same this weekend up at a cabin fishing for Splake with the buds...only difference is we'll be ON THE ICE
316845,ehg,2009-03-13 13:36:00,2666,Nice little report! Good to add some more fish to the team totals
316850,Greencoachdog,2009-03-13 13:44:00,8163,"Thanks for the kind words y'all!   I've tried to get him to join, but he just doesn't care anything about computers and the internet.   We cook them 3 ways down here... fried, fried, and fried!!!  I think a lot of the muddy taste comes from people that don't keep or clean their fish properly. I either keep my fish alive or on ice from the time they come off the hook until cleaning time. I've seen so many people just stick them in a bucket or let them lay in the bottom of the boat to die, turn stiff and dry out... disgusting! Fish start decomposing as soon as it dies!  Hacking thru and ungutted organ cavity with a fillet knife isn't good either... I'd rather not have my fillets smeared with feces and bladder bile thank you very much!  Another major cause of strong or muddy flavor in fish is the fish's blood. Fish with a heavy lateral line (blood line) on the skin side of a fillet will taste strong or muddy if the line isn't removed while cleaning.  I don't ever have a problem with my fish tasting bad... but I'm very picky about the way my fish are handled and clean.   Yes he is, maybe not this year... but we've talked about it! He also asks about all y'all   whenever I talk to him.   The nudie shots should be coming out next month!  Yes, he was a cold and hungry little Spotted Bass."
316861,The Urban Fisherman,2009-03-13 14:04:00,2050,"doesn't get much better than that dude!  You got me all stoked to hit some soft water this weekend, as long as the launches aren't still frozen up on Sunday I'm good to go!  I guess you don't have to worry about those sorts of things eh...  Cheers, UF"
316870,Headhunter,2009-03-13 14:15:00,5703,"Awe, man, imagine my disapointment when I thought I read ""Two red heads go fishing"" only to see those less than attractive non red heads in the pics! Thanks for the report... please try to read my mind better in the future! HH"
