317284,JeffBornFishin,2009-03-14 15:37:00,260, Take a team sign
317287,JeffBornFishin,2009-03-14 15:39:00,260,Great report and pic Cliff  Thats a pretty nice looking fish for first one of the year.  I would like to give that a try sometime.  I am sure you and Bly will catch a whole mess of 'em next time around
317293,Cookslav,2009-03-14 15:57:00,1457,"Good on you for persisting! That purdy fish makes it worth while for sure....beautifull coloring on that fish. Cheers,"
317294,kemper,2009-03-14 15:59:00,2232, Oh I will...and I might just nudge Cliffs into the water when hes not looking.  Call it friendly competition
317299,NAC,2009-03-14 16:08:00,369," Huh, whatchu talkin bout Willis?  Surely you're not knocking the Niagara fishery...."
317341,ccmtcanada,2009-03-14 21:04:00,7971, I don't think he is.  I believe he's talking about the Lake Ontario and Erie tribs south of the border.
317342,jwl,2009-03-14 21:13:00,1056," I wouldn't say he was knocking the Niagara Fishery...when you catch a 5 lber one drift and a 12 lber the next, they aren't cookie cutters  it's a diverse mix of a couple strains of fish..been getting lots of big fin clipped stockers thuogh...good year for it from all the stocking 4-5 years ago..thanks to the US side"
317345,lucabrasi,2009-03-14 21:26:00,114,Nice going!! That's not a tough day at all. Sometimes catching the one and only fish you work your butt off for can be so rewarding.
317379,Greencoachdog,2009-03-14 22:49:00,8163,"  yanno, without a face to go with that fish... it could be anyones.  Since it's been months since you've caught a fish... you wouldn't have happened to met up with the Kemper dude on the trib, took a pic of his fish and paid him $20 to let you claim here for your own eh?  "
317381,ccmtcanada,2009-03-14 22:52:00,7971, Glen Glen Glen....  You know me better than that....  I wont pay more that $10 for that.
317384,Greencoachdog,2009-03-14 22:55:00,8163, Bwahahahaha!!!  I guess I over estimated your level of desperation by $10!
317033,ccmtcanada,2009-03-13 22:06:00,7971,"Well, it's been a long time since Bly and I have been out fishing...and since I had the day off, and a babysitter, we decided to head out this morning.  We were a little nervous of our first choice, because of  waters that are slow moving and the -12C temps last night.  We didn't leave the house until about 815am....later than we probably should have, but oh well...  Sure enough, the first spot was mostly all frozen over, with a small 10 foot wide section available to drift...only about 100 feet long.  Problem was, there were about 8 guys drifting in that spot...so back in the car for plan B.  Plan B didn't turn out so well either...the waters had only about 2"" of visibility but we tried it for a while anyways.  After about 45 minutes of no action whatsoever, and absolutely nothing caught by anyone we talked to around us, we packed up again and came up with plan C.  We arrived at location 3 to near perfect water conditions...green tinged waters with about 8"" of visibility!  Problem was because it was now so late in the morning, it was packed!  All our favourite spots were taken, so we headed to a spot that we don't generally do all that well at...apparently no one else does either, because it was void of any anglers...LOL.  About 15 minutes drifting this section and my float goes down.  I set the hook and feel what I think is a snag...and then there is nothing there.  Then I see that my line is too slack....wayyyyy too slack, so I started reeling like a madman...knowing that a fish was swimming directly at me!  This little guy jumped a few times, trying to escape, but to no avail.  So, here it is...my first fish of 2009...this scrappy little steelie....and a first entry for team inTENsity!   We packed it in shortly after that, and were home for 1pm...the season has just started...cant wait to get out there again!"
317035,Leecher,2009-03-13 22:14:00,7832,Great report and pic Cliff  Congratulations on your first of the season     Real beauty Thank god that plan C panned out for your guys     Did you have a plan D just in case?? Thanks for sharing Leechman
317037,Greencoachdog,2009-03-13 22:18:00,8163,Glad you finally caught a fish Cliff!!!  ... but don't feel like you have to go cluttering up that nice clean entry board with nasty ol' fish pics eh!
317042,ccmtcanada,2009-03-13 22:29:00,7971,"Leech - Plan D...we did actually...but by the time we discussed it, hunger took over and we headed home for lunch.   We spent more time driving from place to place than we did actually fishing I think!  GCD - Our entry board is just fine...was already cluttered with a Lake Trout...LOL"
317043,diggyj,2009-03-13 22:30:00,548,Awsome catch Cliff.  What did you catch it on?  dirk....
317047,Leecher,2009-03-13 22:42:00,7832, Cliff next time don't discuss Plan D..... go for Plan E and bring some sandwiches along so that you don't have to go back home early  Again great job you guys!!
317048,ccmtcanada,2009-03-13 22:43:00,7971,Hey Dirk...  Caught with roe...chartreuse coloured bag.
317050,misfish,2009-03-13 22:47:00,29133, My fovorite combo Cliff. Great report and job by you and Bly.
317055,KelfuN,2009-03-13 23:01:00,246,"great job Cliff!  i was also out hunting some steel today in the east, but no luck... however, yesterday was a different story"
317087,Mike the Pike,2009-03-14 00:06:00,3421,  Nice fishy Cliff I don't understand you could have had lunch cause your lunch box is stuck to you chest
317090,ccmtcanada,2009-03-14 00:10:00,7971, The lunch box stuck on my chest is food for the fish...not me...  When are you getting out here Mike?  Steelhead fishing is just beginning...I stop fishing for them at the trout opener...so get out here soon and I'll do my darndest to get you into a few.  I'm no solopaddler as far as guiding is concerned...but I can catch a few fish by myself at times...lol.
317092,jwl,2009-03-14 00:12:00,1056,"nice going on the fish, and the adventure as well, You toughed it out and got rewarded  Next time let Bly show you how it's done with a nice 30 inch-10lber for TEAM#1"
317096,ccmtcanada,2009-03-14 00:14:00,7971, Steelhead season is just beginning...she has plenty of time to kick my butt all over the tribs!!! LOL
317098,douG,2009-03-14 00:18:00,2693,"Very nice, Cliff.  Thanks largely there."
317100,BillM,2009-03-14 00:21:00,17367,"Good job Cliff!!!  I'm heading out tomorrow with the masses, lets hope the spot I picked isn't to crowded"
317102,smokin joe,2009-03-14 00:26:00,226,Great job Cliff and way to hang in there.
317139,Joeytier,2009-03-14 01:46:00,3990,"I was out at Oshawa today for 3-4 hours in the afternoon, and got skunked.  What else is new?  I'll be on the creeks again tomorrow morning rubbing shoulders with everyone else.  Who knows, maybe I'll catch something...."
317140,Paulus,2009-03-14 01:47:00,522,"Good stuff, guys  That's a gorgeous, healthy looking fish. I always prefer our wild, self-sustaining fish over the stocked cookie-cutters of our brethren to the south. They are stronger, faster and more attractive.  I don't think 8:15am was too late for this time of year, for the weather conditions. Most likely, you missed out on 2 hours of freezing your tush off, for the steep cost of extra sleep in a warm bed... not a bad deal, really . When it's as cold as it was last night, the fish often don't turn on until the sun has warmed the water a bit anyway.  Allow me to propagate the good luck : as Bly wished me earlier, I predict that this is the first of many that you'll get in 2009.  Hold onto your seat! And your rod!    p.-"
317144,Cudz,2009-03-14 01:51:00,2652,that is a pretty little fish.
317145,kemper,2009-03-14 01:59:00,2232,"Nice guys!  Ill be home next weekend, maybe we can get a drift in.  I have a new spot, and it has treated me very well!"
317147,ccmtcanada,2009-03-14 02:05:00,7971, You let me know when and where Kemper!  Been wanting to ask you about that new spot...but if you're going to show it to me then all the better...LOL.
317170,Greencoachdog,2009-03-14 02:46:00,8163," Wear ""protection""!!!!!"
317173,Joeytier,2009-03-14 02:47:00,3990,Your wit is unparalleled.
317186,Paully,2009-03-14 03:15:00,712,the first is always the toughest! way to go..
317283,lunkerbasshunter,2009-03-14 15:36:00,2585,sure is a pretty looking fish!  Congrats!  Cheers!
