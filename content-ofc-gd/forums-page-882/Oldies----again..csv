315936,Leecher,2009-03-11 02:37:00,7832,Awesome Bernie  Bet you had fun ridding in that sled Thanks for sharing Leechman
317714,Bernie,2009-03-15 23:03:00,3190,Time to add a couple more.  Some of the guys doing dishes. I suspect around 1960.   Building the huntcamp 1960.    The guys out for a ride to the camp around 1985?   Heading up the lake.   Barber at the hunt camp. Who is next?   A brand new Evinrude . In 1955 or so....   Going fishing. 
317720,kickingfrog,2009-03-15 23:08:00,8333,Great stuff. I know exactly where that last one was taken.
317749,misfish,2009-03-15 23:44:00,29133,Cant believe I just open this thread now. AWESOME AWSOME PICS Bernie. LOVE THEM. Love the old stuff.  Wish I was born back then.I have told my pop the same thing.Things were so much simplier. Thanks for sharing.
317805,Bernie,2009-03-16 01:06:00,3190,Glad you enjoyed them Brian. We replaced those heavy shavers in for something lighter in the mid 1970's.
317815,Gerritt,2009-03-16 01:15:00,6129,Simply amazing pictures B.... Keep em coming like the other fellas said!  G
315013,Bernie,2009-03-09 01:34:00,3190,"Still scanning slides and finding a few treasures. I posted in the photo section last time but only a few folks commented. So I'm not sure if no one is interested in this stuff or no one looks in the photography section. For those that don't look around the whole site here you could be missing out on some good information too. Anyway here's a selection of a couple from todays scan.  The hunt camp my grandpa bought many moons ago. Can't even find where it was now. It's rotted away to nothing.   The guys unloading their soda pop for the two weeks hunt.   I can just barely remember this truck.   We still play for penny's, no hard feelings that way.   This fellow is from Ohio. Len Uher was his name. Great guy. Him, his brother Louis and dad would spend a few days ice fishing each year.   The original Motley Crew   I love this shot. Think I may frame it.   Tough going that time of the year in the bush.   That's all for now. If you would like to see more in the future let me know."

315488,Bernie,2009-03-10 02:57:00,3190,Here's a few more from tonights bunch.  This is the way it was done before the $199 CT augers   Skinning up a days catch.   Showing off a couple of Pickerel.   My Dad front and center and his long time friends.   Sawing logs at the Powassan fall fair around 1956   The guy with the Ski-doo was a friend of dads. I am on the sled in front of mom and my brother on the toboggan. 
315494,irishfield,2009-03-10 03:06:00,26272, Now that's a real antique !!! Not you.. the sled ! 
315513,bigugli,2009-03-10 03:52:00,6138," Those cases hearken from the days when beer was drunk by the quart. Good old IPA or Molson Blue, and Pilsener for the Labatt's types"
