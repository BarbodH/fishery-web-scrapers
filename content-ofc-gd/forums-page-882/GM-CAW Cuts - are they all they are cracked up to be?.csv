However, it's equally as foolish to believe that overpaid line workers aren't a contributing factor.

The eight-hour work day, the forty-hour work week, the right to refuse unsafe work, paid vacation, and just about every other labour law that protects working people...all because of unionism.  And before somebody dusts off ""unions have outlived their usefulness"" (the age-old mantra of all anti-unionists) keep in mind that big business would like nothing more than to claw back everything we've fought for the first chance they get.

They fought for all of today's standards I'll give you that but it has turned most long time workers into lazy arrogant and full of entitlement pickerheads. No one has a right to a good job, you have to earn it and work to keep it. I'm sorry but you should be judged on your performance not how much time you have on the job. I see too much abuse of this because if layoff's happen they know they still have a job so they screw around with no fear. Put in an honest days work and you will be rewarded. Works for me, work hard all summer and in the winter the boss keeps me busy even if it doesn't pay him because I make him money in the good times and I guess they want to keep me around   and others in the company are on UI  , wonder why? To many around me took the General for granted and now they helped kill the golden goose and they are all freaking out. I guess the backyard BBQ's will have a little less bragging about the easy life at the Motors. Don't get me wrong I feel bad for them and I hope they land on their feet but they were also part of the problem if the ""Against Management and Ain't my job attitude"" I witnessed was part of the culture there.

I'm not a big union buff and I think they have gone a too far but it's hard not to ask when management is making hundreds of thousands and in some cases millions of dollars a year. I also wonder when these good paying jobs are where the tax revenue will come from, the rich pay little and the poor can't and with the middle class gone, where will it come from?"

To bad for the fact that us regular people paying $30,000+ for your automoitve products are the ones getting screwed, not to mention that we the public are then asked to bail your arses out with our tax dollars....

Unions are solely responsible for creating the middle class in North America. They are responsible for the fact that you, your parents, and grandparents all owned a decent house, reared a bunch of kids, owed a vehicle, went on a vacation or two each year, and retired comfortably at an age when they could enjoy it. You didn't have to be a union worker to enjoy these benefits. The union workers did the dirty work and raised the bar for everyone. Unions are losing members in today's society. And the standard of living is going down as well. Coincidence? I think not.  We are in a global financial crisis right now. It happens every other decade or so. We'll get through it. The huge industries will once again be making millions and billions in profits. And the unions will stand up for what is right and what is wrong as far as the labor force goes. And we will all benefit from it."

Automobiles are ridiculously overpriced due to obseen labor, and profit requirements that have been inflated over time by unions and Execs. Thats what puts our standard of living down...companies chargeing the common man to much for nessasary products. Energy, Gas, food, realestate...  Its all over priced, becasue the entire world has messed up our wealth distribution. We pay our Garbage men outrageous amounts of money, and we pay an unskilled Laborer crazy amounts of dough to assemble parts at a plant, Yet we pay EMT's & Nurses who could save our life and deal with tradgedy every day like crap.... We pay a dishwashers minimum wage, but a janitor at a school or plant $20/hour  Its messed up, and I don't think Unions are helping that very much. Trades seem to be on the level as far as fair pay for work, arguably doctors & Surgeons seem to be paid fair.  You know what would be really cool, but it would never fly.... A federal wage cap, and profit share requirement for all business in Canada. Put quite simply... No man woman or child can make more then 1 million dollars a year, (owner ship excluded) That coupled with a 15% company profit margin cap...meaning any profit brought in over 15% has to be divided amongst the labor.  That would evenly distribute the wealth, that would make a lean mean work force, no union needed, and the economy fixed. But we all know thats to simple...that would never happen. But wouldn't it be nice? Every person working getting a fair share of Extra cash to spend...no fat cat execs makeing $20 million dollars...all comapnies held to the same profit requirements meaning the only competative edge left is the quality of your product.  Thats fair and thats why it'll never happen. To much greed out there from the ground up....but just Imagine. Cue the music"

316226,Dutch,2009-03-12 00:12:00,831,"Article that ran in my local paper I'd like to share.  By no means am I slagging GM employees by posting this, more the sad state the executives have let that company become.  The writer seems to try and pin this on the employees, but I thought the facts laid out in the article were the most telling points, even if the author seems somewhat biased, it's the facts that ring home.  GM is in a sad state and I don't think taxpayer dollars should go to support mis-managed industries.....  ====================== Deal by GM, union fails to impress Posted By GREG WESTON Posted 6 hours ago   Judging by all the breathless media coverage of the ""historic"" deal between General Motors and its Canadian union, one would think the autoworkers agreed to sacrifice their left lugnut for company and country.  Alas, objects in this mirror are much smaller than they appear.  The federal and Ontario governments have been demanding the unions take a tire-iron to their gold-plated employment contracts before GM gets a dime from taxpayers.  With upwards of $7 billion in government loans on the table, GM and its workers have oh-so-reluctantly agreed to a deal, which union president Ken Lewenza describes as ""a major sacrifice by our members and retirees.""  Here are some of those heart-wrenching sacrifices, with a warning that what follows may cause ordinary hard-working taxpayers to experience fits of dizziness and nausea.  * The deal freezes base wages until mid-2012. In fact, it changes almost nothing -- last year, the union agreed to a pay freeze until mid-2011.  * Quarterly cost-of-living increases are suspended until 2012.  Those pay hikes had already been suspended until mid-2010, and with inflation near zero, the increases wouldn't have amounted to much anyway.  * Ditto for annual cost-of-living increases to pensions until 2012.  Increased pensions had already been nixed for a year, and with low or no inflation, GM pensioners will barely notice them missing for another three years.  It is worth noting that unionized GM employees do not contribute a dime to their pensions during their working lives.  We would also note that at a time when the car companies are asking for billions, the GM pension fund is short, um, billions.  * Spa time is reduced by 40 hours per year. Before your head explodes, ""spa"" stands for ""special paid absence,"" an extra week of paid time off that all GM unionized workers get in addition to their annual vacations.  A union exec explains spa weeks were originally negotiated in part to force GM to hire more workers to replace the ones on spa weeks.  This also helps to explain why the company is now broke.  * ""An annual $1,700 special bonus payment is being diverted to help offset the cost of retiree health care benefits.""  Translation: Unionized autoworkers are giving up their $1,700 Christmas bonuses so their retired brethren will each get an extra roughly $250 a year to cover new health premiums (see below).  The net benefit to GM -- and taxpayers -- is precisely zero.  * GM is cutting its contribution to a whole range of employee perks by a third.  Those include subsidized daycare and even legal services for union workers buying a house or getting divorced.  * Finally, unionized auto workers will have to pay a staggering $30 a month each for their health and other benefits; retirees $15.  Truth is, all those years of huddling around the flaming oil drums on the picket lines have left the auto workers with the sweetheart of all benefit packages covering health, dental, disability and even tuition.  Until now, the employee contribution to the premiums has been exactly zip.  Add it all up, and the ""major sacrifices"" being made by the autoworkers for billions of taxpayers' dollars are as follows:  Their pay and pensions stay the same. They lose a spa week, and give their Christmas bonus to the oldtimers. They have to pay a bit more for daycare and a divorce, and $30 a month for a benefits package to strike for.  Hold the hankies."

316250,OhioFisherman,2009-03-12 00:48:00,6623,"To me it`s like a giant never ending comedy show and for almost the last 50 years here in the states labor has been the target. They get the vast majority of the bad press possibly because management gets to do the talking?  A negotiated labor contract, union v. management funy how management doesn`t have to go before the union, stock holders before they LOL negotiate their salaries, golden parachutes? Just before a company board of fellow back slappers, you wash my back, I`ll wash your?  At some point in time union workers involved in the contract negotiations gave up some contract demands to get others, if you look at the CEO`s pay it appears they never gave up any thing, good times or bad.  Working people no longer stand together, their memories are to short. Take a look at other businesses affected by auto industry jobs losses, retail, real estate, food, grocery and others, even government. None had a problem gravy training off of money these workers brought to their countries, provinces,states and cities. Now though they don`t want to support them, to much pain on their part, past gain doesn`t  seem to count for anything.  I don`t care for the bail outs, where it`s the banking industry, insurance industry, or auto industry, but it is my opinion it all could have been prevented if the jobs were kept at home and not sold to the lowest paid worker, notice none of the management got that deal?  Even here in the LOL United States you had a bidding war between the states for the foreign auto company plants, and who lost? The worker with lower paying jobs and less benefits, but no problems creating new taxes on the workers to offset the tax break given to companies to build in their states and cities.  We are losing 600+ thousand jobs a month here stateside, where will it end? Do the politicians even care? The mess they created with their bright ideas."

316568,bigbuck,2009-03-12 20:57:00,2449,"GM has dropped the ball, they built inferior vehicles with problems that should have been corrected but they continued cranking out cars with stupid expensive problems (the intake manifold gaskets on the 3.4 and 3.8 that led to engine failure-inexcusable, this went on for years, head gasket failures on the Sunfire and Cavaliers- 2 of their most popular models, the list goes on and on....) I myself have been lucky, I'm a GM guy but my loyalty is coming to an end. A car is too big an expense initially to have a lot of ongoing expenses because of ticking timebombs in the car that should be corrected. I understand problems with a car the first model year to a certain extent but for those problems to persist for years without correction is INTOLERABLE!!! I'm venting and have a purple face right now, they should be allowed to go Chapter 11 and restructure and hopefully they will emerge a stronger and hopefully a SMARTER company. My heart goes out to the retirees but the company cannot go on the way it is and they will have to get their pensions and health benefits slashed for the company to be able to go on, otherwise, everyone will lose everything. The taxpayers should not be on the hook for corporate mismanagement and ineptitude. Can those that should be canned and don't give them golden parachutes, they can be like everyone else and have a chunk of lead strapped to their a......ss before they make them jump out of the plane."

Wow... Go ahead...close your meare 2 plants (Windsor and Brampton), close your 200 dealerships, and the one parts plant you own. Go ahead and lay off the 6000 employees then pay them out their severance and be on your way....  We'll just take Thats 2.3 billion dollar bail out, and the 500 million dollar lein and divide it by the 6000 unemployed workers and give  $466,666.67 to each one...that would not only make the employees dam happy, but most of that money would make its way back into the economy, and buy a CRAP LOAD of time to get these employees re-trained to do somthing else.  Sure that will never happen, but it sure puts the ""demands"" into perspective Doesn't it? They want wage consessions of $20/hour from each employee, and aid/releif of $2,800,000,000 And with out this gross amount they say they cannot compete in the market....

After the Greed takes over, ( a cut to the company, the dealer and seller, and the government again) me the Buyer will probably save 50 dollars.
