317571,e-z-out,2009-03-15 16:12:00,1052,yes sir i like it sounds clean. It better sound clean coming from a V8
317572,kemper,2009-03-15 16:16:00,2232,I feel like I just heard fourteen liters of gas get burned up....  sounds cool though!
317604,Gerritt,2009-03-15 18:55:00,6129,sorry but makes no sense to me...
317606,Billy Bob,2009-03-15 19:00:00,5865,"SEE, the internet is not always a good thing........."
317607,JohnF,2009-03-15 19:01:00,3494, Isn't there anything about the rumble of exhaust that tweaks something way down deep? I still roll down the car windows to listen when I see a bike or car that might have that sound.  My wife disapproves too. Guess that's why none of our vehicles have it any more.  JF
317610,Raf,2009-03-15 19:09:00,3495,sounds good randy.  makes me want to put an exhaust on the jeep and a turbo + vented blow off valve & downpipe.  ahhhh... someone slap me
317613,Muskieman,2009-03-15 19:14:00,2472,  My Expedition did 9.5 MPG city and 12.0 HWY  .... I've since added a EDGE Performance Tuner and a TBS..and a K&N Cold Air Intake along with a Tornado Insert  ....I've upped my horsepower 25% and I now do 12.9 city and about 18.6 hwy.. Total cost of 800.00$ ...I do all my own installs Less restrictive exhaust and more air flow = more power & Better fuel economy .. It's almost paid for itself in fuel economy...  And I like the sound..  I work in parts as a living  ... to sell myself the O.E replacement I'd of paid 110.00$ for my muffler.. In this case I paid  86.00$  Stainless Steel Lifetime Warranty.  My Truck sees alot of HWY and Offroad... I figure I've got the best of both worlds.
317618,Raf,2009-03-15 19:28:00,3495,"Randy, chuck that tornado insert away.  If it's the one I am thinking of it does nothing but restrict the intake."
317626,misfish,2009-03-15 19:40:00,29133,All yer missing is a dual pipe outfit. Sweet sound Randy.

317744,Fisherman,2009-03-15 23:36:00,7201,"It's on a Ford ""Feeble Offering Roaring Dimly""  and a Tornado, hahahahah  Get a little closer to the snowbank, maybe you can blow some away."

317801,Greencoachdog,2009-03-16 01:00:00,8163," I refer to them as ""tick-turd"" exhaust systems."
