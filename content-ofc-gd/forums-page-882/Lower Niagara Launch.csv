316812,outdoor,2009-03-13 11:53:00,19,Can anyone give me directions and pointers for the lower Niagara? I generally fish for Bass but thought I'd like to give the Niagara a try. I'm guessing spinners and spoons are the lure's of choice. Any info would be appreciated.
316819,Paully,2009-03-13 12:24:00,712,... roe and streamers are the lures of choice.
316820,BillM,2009-03-13 12:30:00,17367,"What are you fishing for?  Steelhead?  If so, roe, streamers, egg sucking leeches, etc etc.  Typical steelhead stuff."
316831,Billy Bob,2009-03-13 13:04:00,5865,The best lure for salmon and steelhead on the lower Niagara would be the Quick Fish. VERY similar to the old Flat Fish lure. Fished on a three way rig just like you do when you drift roe.  Bob
316934,outdoor,2009-03-13 16:38:00,19,Thanks for the tips but where can I launch at?
316953,Spiel,2009-03-13 17:37:00,9065,Mapquest Dumfries Rd. Queenston. The ramp is straight on through at the end of the road.
316958,outdoor,2009-03-13 17:49:00,19,"Thanks, Spiel, the last time I tried to launch there in the fall it was closed. Maybe they were fixing it up or something. I ended up having to go all way back to Grimsby. Hopefully it will be open on Sunday to get the lines wet."
316972,BillM,2009-03-13 19:00:00,17367,I think the only time it's ever 'closed' is when you don't feel like breaking ice in order to get the boat in
316988,jwl,2009-03-13 19:53:00,1056,ya that launch is always open..I just got back from there  best baits of the day....black scum frogs twitched off the top of the ice chunks just like fishing bass in the lilies
317004,Billy Bob,2009-03-13 20:38:00,5865, I have found little snowmen with the treble hook mounted .............well we wouldn't go there.  GOOD LUCK fishing and let us know how you did.  Bob
317016,shayne,2009-03-13 21:11:00,21,"Was down there today Jack.....The bait of the day was a small piece of Scnieder's weiner.....with a touch of mayonaise. Too much mayo and you wont catch anything, so be conservative!! The key, was to fish the piece of weiner about a foot below the surface!!  They were killing them!! :D  :lol:  :lol: Steelhead"
317036,jwl,2009-03-13 22:15:00,1056," ahhh man, shhhhh!!!!  We went 8 for 12 today, will toss a couple pic up later"
317148,NANUK,2009-03-14 02:08:00,797,"Beware of thiefs @ Queenston launch, quite a few vehicle got broken in upper parking lot lately. I hate those low lives"
317165,jwl,2009-03-14 02:37:00,1056,"there was about 20 security guards fishing on shore today  too busy to have that kind of trouble today, although it has happened on occasion..solution..leave nopthing of value in your car"
317219,Zebco,2009-03-14 04:49:00,123,"You might have went to the wrong entrance last time, you used to be able to use them both b4 the jet boat took over now there is a gate."
