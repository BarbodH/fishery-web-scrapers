So what I am asking here is, does anybody know a good place or somebody who will do work needed to bring this thing back to life for a good price?  I believe it needs to be ""buffed"" with an automotive buffing compound and possibly""wet-sanded"" I know nothing about this stuff, all I know is me and a buffer will burn the crap out of it and I do not trust myself...  I know there are several other things out there like apply on type clearcoat surfaces, but those chip/flake/fade away and need to be repeated every year Ive heard...  So a good buff, possible wet sand  anybody know anyone?  thank you! Im located in Etobicoke"

You can use the buffer after the compound when you wax it.  Rubbing your boat out by hand will build up your Kung Fu skills!!!... wax on... wax off!"
