317302,Leecher,2009-03-14 16:24:00,7832,"Today I woke up at 6:45am, got my gear loaded in the car and headed for Lac Leamy.  Temp was at -8C and a slight breeze from the south west..... couldn't ask for better  At 7:15am, stopped at the d√©panneur ""corner store"" for a hot brew and the way I went.  Got to the lake around 7:30am, just before sunrise and managed a pic of it.... beautiful sight!!    Here another shot at the Casino    And the highway 50 close by    Got setup in the same area as last time but just a little deeper.... Tipups were in 10 fow and my jigging hole was between 12 - 15 fow in front of the creek that leads to the Gatineau river.   Here's a shot of it    And again here is my setup    Didn't take long for the perch to notice my offerings.... first one on my tipup    and the second one    At some point I noticed 2 people walking in the distance and going for a walk in the bush.... looked familiar but could not identify them..... was too far away.  Then all of sudden this guy decided to pay me a visit from above    Must of been cold up there cause that south west breeze sure was making me wear my extra clothing I had brought.  At around 9:40am, decided to call it a day cause my daughter had to go to bowling and did not want to be late!! All in all caught 2 perch on the tipups and none on the jigging rod Real nice to be out Going tomorrow morning same place and hope to land some eyes Hope you enjoy! Leechman"
317310,darsky,2009-03-14 16:50:00,586,"Leech-those hooks look quite large for perch,do you miss many?"
317312,Leecher,2009-03-14 16:58:00,7832," No I don't.  Always been fishing with them for the longest time and never had a problem.  When the perch are on the feed, they don't mind it at all.  The reason I use them is that the body of waters we have up here are infested with pike and don't want to loose a fish for a hook that would brake off easily.  Another funny thing is that I don't target perch at all and seemed to hook them all the time"
317442,Whitespinnerbait,2009-03-15 01:24:00,2038,So like I said Jacques my wife and I went nature walking this Morning......   Was surprised to see Canada geese in the creek leading to the Lake you were fishing.......         In the field just over the hill from were you where there was plenty of deer.....       But here's a pic of the strangest animal of the Day...  :dunno:       :lol:

317469,Leecher,2009-03-15 02:06:00,7832, Dang.... and here I thought I had the lake to myself
