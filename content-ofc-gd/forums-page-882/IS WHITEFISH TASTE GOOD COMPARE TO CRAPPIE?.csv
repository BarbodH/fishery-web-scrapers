317333,DRIFTER_016,2009-03-14 20:33:00,10439,"Whities are yummy!! Real Northern Lake Trout are yummy too!!! Not those grease balls you guys grow down south, but a good northern one like they grow in my area. I think Moosebunk has eaten a couple of good northern Lakers and he can confirm their eating qualities. Ling are as good or better than any fresh water fish out there."
317334,Muskieman,2009-03-14 20:36:00,2472,Don't fry in a pan !!   Cut into nuggets or fingers and Deep Fry in a coating of you choice and enjoy the meal!!  Very Good  ...  RFS 
317349,Leecher,2009-03-14 21:36:00,7832,"I've only caught one of them this year, first time targeting them and let me tell you they taste real good.  I prefer whities over walleyes to tell you the truth!!  I cooked the whitie filets the same way as I would the walleye, in the pan with butter, salt and pepper and a touch of garlic salt to taste.  Doesn't taste any better than that!! Leechman"
317361,pike slayer,2009-03-14 21:57:00,1177,"i love all fish! lake trout are great eating just behind specks, specks just have that extra little kick to them that i cant explain. whitefish are alrite i'm not crazy for them but do enjoy eating them. now you cant beat a good northern ontario northern pike, the best out there and i'll take them over walleye any day. and we dont have crappies here and when i was down in southern ontario i caught a few and tried them and they tasted like mud and dirt! the they were the only fish i have ever thrown out cause i couldnt eat it. i dont see a point in going for crappies unless you are getting them for bait or taking the kids out to catch a few fish, they are always tiny and they taste horrible."
317386,Fisherman,2009-03-14 23:00:00,7201,"The trick with cooking whities is to remove the brownish liver coloured stripe on the mid exterior of the fillet, if you don't it will taste like     I would say it's sort of like fresh cod(not the stuff from the grocery store) real fresh."
317405,misfish,2009-03-14 23:48:00,29133, Exactly.
