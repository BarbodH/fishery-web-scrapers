I was thinking of maybe Frenchmans bay, Tommy thompson park (leslie spits), or maybe the harbour front.  Any thoughts on which spot would be most productive? or any spot which would be better than any of those 3.  Any advice appreciated"

315974,yo_guy,2009-03-11 04:48:00,111,"All the above spots mentioned are great spots during the spring time you just gotta go and try it.  I would go leslie spits first, ontario place harbour front before heading to frenchmans bay depending where you live.  Right now the water is still cold toss a 4"" chub with a float and relax or work a jerk bait with slow retrieve. "

316551,nofrills,2009-03-12 20:25:00,89,You're right about the Centre Island Ferry....BUT the other Ferrys still operate. Nothing wrong with a little hike!

317617,ADB,2009-03-15 19:26:00,444,"Shawn.V and I headed over to Ward's Island today.  Unfortunately, most of the inner canals were still iced over and it was hard to fish.  We were forced to mostly fish into the main lake, which netted nothing.  Back on the mainland, we tried fishing off of Queen's Quay.  Again, we had no luck.  Great day to be outside, though."
