316794,rob v,2009-03-13 10:38:00,535,I recently bought an older honda outboard - but it didn't come with fuel line or fuel line couplers.  I couldn't locate an after market product made specifically for this motor (honda) so I bought a model (female coupler that hooks to the motor) that says its made for Johnson/Evinrude.  It seems to fit and doesn't leak.  I've gotten the motor to run but it's not running well and I'm trying to eliminate possible problems.   I'm sure I've got some carb adjustments to make also.  Can the wrong fuel coupler make a difference to the operation of an outboard ??  I know there's people on this board with a lot of outboard experience and any input would be appreciated.  Thx.
316795,BITEME,2009-03-13 11:22:00,1968,quick answer no keep plugging away go to a honda dealership and buy the manual you wont regret it probably around $90.00 worth its weight in gold
316798,Fisherman,2009-03-13 11:31:00,7201,"Well I'm not 100% sure, but if the coupler doesn't seal then you may be sucking a bit of air, I'm in the same boat, picked up an older Honda 8, have to get the fuel coupler for the motor end and a new tank coupler fitting."
316800,OhioFisherman,2009-03-13 11:33:00,6623,"I don`t know what a honda coupler looks like but try fitting a merc one to an older Johnson-evinrude, it ain`t going to happen! Not sure, maybe hondas use metric measurements? It might be sucking air?"
316807,Sinker,2009-03-13 11:45:00,8692,"It should work if its not leaking. I'd say your carb is gummed up. If its running, try running some seafoam thru it. Its available at most NAPA auto parts stores.  Sinker"
316821,BITEME,2009-03-13 12:32:00,1968,If you are looking for air leaks an unlit propane torch works great direct the gas at the questionable area and if it leaks the engine will speed up a little from the propane mark the spot and move on after you have covered everthing go back and reseal and try again.
316827,rob v,2009-03-13 12:55:00,535,"Thanks for the info.  I don't think it's sucking any air - the bulb pumps up and stays firm - and I don't see any fuel leakage.   That unlit propane torch is a new one - I'm not sure I,m real comfortable with that idea - but it sounds like a good one.  I think the next step is the seafoam idea.  I had planned on doing something like that eventually.  thx."

316908,rob v,2009-03-13 15:34:00,535,OMC engine tuner - besides a specialty marine store -  can you buy this stuff anywhere else ?
316919,2 tone z71,2009-03-13 16:05:00,1311,"unfortunatly its gotta be a dealer,but overnight this stuff will take the gunk out of anything and turn the varnished parts to a nice brass finish again,there are others available but I will not use anything else"
317161,NANUK,2009-03-14 02:23:00,797,"There is a little ball inside the coupler which gets depressed and allows the flow when you connect to the motor, it stops the gas from coming out of hose when you disconnect, maybe and just maybe its not getting fully depressed because its not the right part for your motor, just a guess. I would try to get the proper coupler for that motor before getting in to more complicated stuff like dis-assembling and tinkering with carbs, replacing gaskets etc."
317169,SlowPoke,2009-03-14 02:45:00,2984,"Hi Rob, I have a Honda BF8 with tank/hoses etc. You're welcome to drop by and give it a run off my tank. Mine was running a little rough and hard starting but a little carb tweaking did the job. I'm sure mine could use a good carb cleaning as well! South London... Bradley/Millabnk area"
317233,boatman,2009-03-14 11:38:00,350,"What size hp are we talking about?  If the inside diameter of the OMC style fitting is smaller than the Honda then it could be restricting fuel flow. However, I doubt that is the case. I'd bet its something else. I've replaced Mercury fuel connectors with OMC style and they work fine (and are better and easier to find).  I use spray oil like WD-40 instead of propane. You can buy seafoam at NAPA. That's the only place I've found it.  What problems are you experiencing? Its hard to help without knowing what's going on."
