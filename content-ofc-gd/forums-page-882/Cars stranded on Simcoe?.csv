317685,motv8tr,2009-03-15 22:16:00,2587,"Hear on the news that last night a few vehicles were stranded on Simcoe near innisfil Beach Park due to a gap opening in the ice, they are warning people to stay off as it's so unpredictable right now.  Did anyone see anything like that today?  Maureen"
317688,Joey,2009-03-15 22:18:00,9122,"The shore is separating from the ice, but we fishermen always find a way off   .  Doubt any were really stranded.  Just the news scaring people again probably  Joey"
317706,camillj,2009-03-15 22:52:00,1988,"Well judging by the folks bombing around on all type of vehicles today (cars, trucks, atvs, sleds etc) ... including the MNR folks ... it was pretty safe ... I guess with the warming weather the shorelines could get a little dodgy ... but thats what spring ice fishing is all about  No issues for me when I walked in ... there was a Sausage wagon waiting near shore ... I think it was called the ""Dog Sled"" .. hit the spot  Was probably one of the nicest days I have spent on the ice this year (even if the fishin was a little quiet)"
