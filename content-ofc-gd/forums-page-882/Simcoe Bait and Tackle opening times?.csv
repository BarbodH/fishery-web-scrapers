317141,Cudz,2009-03-14 01:48:00,2652,I went onto their websit and it says they open at 7am.  Does anyone know if they open earlier?  I hae been there right at 7 am in the past and they looked as though they were open for while.  I should have phoned them today but it is too late now and I am going fishing tomorrow am.
