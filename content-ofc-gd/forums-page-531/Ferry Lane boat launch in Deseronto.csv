I would hate to get there in the early morning and find no parking - or worse, have my vehicle towed while fishing.  Also, while I am asking...how has the walleye fishing been lately in the area..and any suggestions?  Cheers."
589220,jimmer,2011-06-02 17:20:00,2730,There is a launch in Desoronto at a park that has lots of parking. I think there is a charge of $3 in/out. Fishing should be heating up after a slower than last year start. Look for any weed growth and try trolling with erie dearies tipped with worms or you can slow down and jig any weedlines that you can find. It's usually good in the bay out from the trailer park to the left of the launch and anywhere up the reach along the west side.
