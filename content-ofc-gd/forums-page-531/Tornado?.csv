Hope the power comes back before the fights and hockey game tonight so i can turn off the generator
589820,lew,2011-06-04 22:55:00,12766,"We lost our power a month or so back and never got it back on for 50 hours, so I sure hope you have better luck than we did."
589822,strik,2011-06-04 23:23:00,175,"Lots of trees down  couple sheads, barns, down some areas still no power said it might be down for the night. Brother  just picked up the geney said it has been a long day  I lets hope everyone is ok  Strik"
589824,misfish,2011-06-04 23:30:00,29133," I have to say,the skies over the bay this morning sure looked green. Was wondering if it was going to happen.  Got your power back yet?"
589854,Rattletrap2,2011-06-05 01:39:00,1652,"It tore trough here this morning. We went from dead calm....to fierce high winds....then back to dead calm and rain. We lost power for about 1/2 hour as well. Some stuff got tossed around outside and a lot of branches down, but otherwise okay.  Hope you get your power back quick."
589861,Twocoda,2011-06-05 02:00:00,4130,power just came back right now Brian...still no confirmation on an actual tornado but North Bruce to Chesley is one heck of a mess...
