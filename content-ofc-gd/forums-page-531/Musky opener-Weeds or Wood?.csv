I haven't spent much time in the boat yet this season, last time I was out about 3 weeks back (fishing for walleye)I saw very little in the way of weeds/weed beds. I'll probably be fishing on Chemong again, last time out I came across some nice stump fields and shallow bays with a lot of submerged wood. I also located some areas that are now likely to be producing decent weed growth. Anybody have much luck/success fishing the timber for early season musky or would I be better off concentating more on weed beds. Rocky shoals? Any way to keep the bass at bay besides supersizing? Thanks."
589372,mike rousseau,2011-06-03 03:36:00,4661,Well I fished the Ottawa river last year on that opener and the hightest concentration of musky I found was in a shallow bay on the inside line of a weedbed and it was full of stumps... The fish were holding tight to the wood that day...  But if you find GOOD weeds... I would concentrate on that...  Also depending on whether your water is cold or warm and weather that day... Cold water and sunny= rocks ...and so on...

589520,jediangler,2011-06-03 18:17:00,1923,I'm going for the stumps. Can't beat skinny water muskies.
589616,Weeds,2011-06-03 22:30:00,782,I guess I'll start with the stumps then. Thanks
589618,esoxansteel,2011-06-03 22:43:00,1307,"Seen 2 pairs of spawning fish a week ago, early in the year muskies are notorious for having a real liking to reeds, I would fish those, and then fish both wood and weed flats as well, working my way to the weed edge, chemong is also a great lake for inside weed edges, which are often over-looked by anglers, start shallow and work your way out to deeper water"
589801,Weeds,2011-06-04 20:19:00,782,Nothing doing this morning. Fished for about 3 hours before the lightning chased me off the water just before 10. May get out this evening and hit some local spots.
589803,mike rousseau,2011-06-04 20:32:00,4661,2 musky so far and 10 follows... 2 pike
