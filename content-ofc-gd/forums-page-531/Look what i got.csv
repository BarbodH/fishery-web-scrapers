589325,mercman,2011-06-03 01:39:00,7054,"I had completely forgotten that when i bought my new boat,  i would be recieving a promotional thank you package from PrinceCraft, and the great people from Thomas Marine. When i opened the box, the wife said jokingly, ""Must be fishing stuff"" Then i started to unpack the box     And the hats match my boat color !!!! Bonus !!!!! I like it when Christmas comes in June  Paul"

589336,g_clot,2011-06-03 01:53:00,104,Makes me wonder why I spent all my money on lures.  I should have bought a boat and used the 'promotional package' instead.  DOH!  
589340,msp,2011-06-03 01:58:00,1336,"Thats awesome! send me a swimbait in pink, one spinnerbait and maybe that max rap. Oh and a hat too ! Nice score"
