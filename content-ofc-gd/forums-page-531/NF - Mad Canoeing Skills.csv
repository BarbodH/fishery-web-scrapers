588678,solopaddler,2011-06-01 02:40:00,8605,  Been working non stop since I've been back Gord.  As per usual a large report will take me minimum 12 hours to whip off.  I need to find the time.
588679,lookinforwalleye,2011-06-01 02:44:00,4399," I am sure your busy, I was just pullin yer leg.  Your reports are always worth the wait!"
588756,Out4Trout,2011-06-01 13:21:00,98,"I think it's the bow-tie. I've never had any reason to spin my canoe like that, but then, I've never worn a bow-tie in the canoe either."
588761,Roy,2011-06-01 13:28:00,13728, Well if he was doing Swan Lake in a plaid shirt it would look silly also.

588866,mercman,2011-06-01 17:22:00,7054,"  I am assuming you mean, as in Happy,"
588871,solopaddler,2011-06-01 17:41:00,8605, Of course not. The term was used in the most figurative way possible.
