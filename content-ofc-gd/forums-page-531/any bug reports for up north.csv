589528,Spiel,2011-06-03 18:32:00,9065,"Ontario, Spring, Bugs....it's a given IMHO. Go prepared for the worst, hope for the best."
589530,TJQ,2011-06-03 18:36:00,7806,"In sturgeon they are not too bad... dragonflies are out, that usually puts the kibosh on them.. but then again.. they dont really bug me all that much anyway..."
589544,manitoubass2,2011-06-03 19:01:00,11391,In Northwestern Ontario there as bad as one can expect. After 32 years though it's not really any bother
589545,Dara,2011-06-03 19:03:00,3052,Just ignore them and they will go away
589550,DRIFTER_016,2011-06-03 19:10:00,10439,No bugs here yet. It's been snowing on and off for the last couple of days. Currently it's a balmy 3*C right now. But there will be bugs and all too soon. I'll have to ready ye olde bug suit shortly.
589552,g_clot,2011-06-03 19:15:00,104,"In Nosbonsing last weekend there were a few skeeters, but I don't recall seeing more than one or two black flies.  Evenings by the dock were the worst, but I only sprayed the OFF! once on the legs.  I didn't even know they were there 90% of the time."
589553,kickingfrog,2011-06-03 19:15:00,8333,Never got bit on Nipissing this week. Though the 33 degrees celsius and 40 kph winds might have had something to do with it.
589557,Rod Caster,2011-06-03 19:19:00,5784," I can't believe you went out in this wind...very strong lately, too much for me. As for the black flies and 'squitos, they aren't that bad and I've been in the bush a lot this spring...but then again, they don't bother me much either way."
589565,ccmtcanada,2011-06-03 19:39:00,7971,"That's the thing...it's very weather dependent.  Check the bug forecast on theweathernetwork.com for the area you are looking to fish ahead of time....but as others have said, prepare for the worst and hope for the best!"
589575,kickingfrog,2011-06-03 20:10:00,8333," The wind was bad, the waves were not."
