It was expected the fish to be scattered all over after the last few days of strong winds....so wasted the first couple hours in search mode but once we found them....well everyone loved the action...  Pictures will give you an idea where the fish was hiding...  Every one managed to reel in a few...the star of the day was the huge King bellow....third fish for me over 25 Lbs this season...and it has just started...Mixed bag....Final score 12/15...not bad...  Anyhow...hope you enjoy the shots:                 Cheers, Ice Fisherman"

589611,Grimace,2011-06-03 22:18:00,2020,Excellent report.  Glad to see them hitting for you.  I can't wait to get out there.  Just started 70 hour weeks.  It's going to hard to squeeze any fishing in.
589623,alphaalpha,2011-06-03 23:27:00,475,"Awesome work, thanks for the report!  I was hoping to get out tonight but it didn't materialize.  Hopefully tomorrow afternoon if the weather cooperates...   -AA"
