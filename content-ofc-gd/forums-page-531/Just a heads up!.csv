589368,BillM,2011-06-03 03:20:00,17367,Tried the Suffix 832 on my Calais last weekend for the first time.  Casts like a dream!
589424,Homer Is King,2011-06-03 13:11:00,305,"I snuck out of work to hit the local CTC. (Hope my boss isn't on this forum! )  I picked up a Phueger President 6735 (25% off), a spool of Suffic 832 (30% off), a 34"" Lucky Strike rubber net (42% off) and a couple floats for $114! (I hope my wife isn't on this forum!)"
589426,johnnyb,2011-06-03 13:15:00,3413,LOLOL....Homer....you so crazy!
589456,lookinforwalleye,2011-06-03 14:41:00,4399,  Just picked up 3 spools still looking for a braid I like perhaps the 832 will be the one!
589458,lookinforwalleye,2011-06-03 14:42:00,4399, Wait till ya get home Homer!
589478,NAW,2011-06-03 15:57:00,4022,"Just got back with 3 packs of 832 (10lb and 30lb), and a new Abu spinning combo..  They are 50% off, but I didn't see it in the flyer.."
589484,Bassaholic,2011-06-03 16:44:00,74,Picked up 3 spools of Suffix 832 last time they had it on sale for $14 and I think I'm going to have to grab a couple more...I'll have enough braid to last me for 5 years.
589502,Pikeslayer,2011-06-03 17:49:00,1443,"Here's a heads up for ya;  CANADIAN TIRE STORES IN MISSISSAUGA ARE A JOKE!!!!!!!!!  Went to Heartland CT at lunch time to specifically buy; Simano Rain Suit............99.99 Lucky Strike Net.............14.99 Pflueger President.........59.99 Suffix 832 x 3.................47.97  Total.............................222.94 (+ HST)  Here's what they had available/in stock; Shimano Rain Suit.........no stock. 1 Available @ Dixie/Dundas + 1 @ Meadowvale Lucky Strike Net............no stock. Available @ Dundas/Mavis Pflueger President........no stock. 1 available @ Dixie/Dundas + 4 @ Meadowvale Suffix 832......................lots available. Didn't buy any.  Spoke to 'Dan the Manager'. ""there's not any demand for fishing stuff here"" and he didn't even order any of the sales items. Suggested that if he actually stocked ""fishing stuff"" he might find that there is indeed a demand given that we are less than 10 clicks away from Lake Ontario.  What a joke!!!!!!!!!!!!! This kind of crap just reaffirms why I don't shop CT anymore. And it makes me appreciate Steve @ JB's and the guys @ LeBarons a lot more.  I HATE CANADIAN TIRE  Slayer"
589511,JoshS,2011-06-03 18:01:00,729,Thanks for the tip... Hopefully they have some 832 in stock! That Pflueger is a good little real for the price too.
589513,msp,2011-06-03 18:08:00,1336,I also tried this line and I feel that it is very over rated. Power pro casts just as far. The whole issue about it not changing colour..... after 3 weeks of fishing its already white/light green. Sorry to highjack the thread
589522,lookinforwalleye,2011-06-03 18:19:00,4399, I will try it this weekend and see!
589526,JoshS,2011-06-03 18:26:00,729," I've heard mixed things so have to try it for myself. I've been a power pro guy for a long time, maybe too long lol."
589593,fishermccann,2011-06-03 21:07:00,655,I bought both the president reel by pfluger and the 832 line I am going to try them this weekend let you know.
589594,GBW,2011-06-03 21:09:00,8460,maybe I should go and get the Mrs a new combo this weekend and some line...
