One way I used to enjoy it was to make a French blend, which has a strong flavour to start with, make it a little extra strong, and sweeten it with a generous amount of maple syrup. I called it a French-Canadian coffee, my own little contribution to national unity! Sadly, no more..."
589589,DRIFTER_016,2011-06-03 20:54:00,10439, I used to have IBS and Acid Reflux but found a way to completely get rid of it. I moved to the NWT and have been fine since and no longer need meds.    :thumbsup_anim: Oh yeah the lifestyle is way better too.

589645,Dave Bailey,2011-06-04 01:40:00,1641,"  Unfortunately it wouldn't work for me, because another thing that sets it off is cold. During cold weather I have to ensure that I have an undershirt tucked into my pants and the sweatshirt mustn't ride up, otherwise one cold draft across my abdomen and I'm off to the sandbox."
