589701,Canadave,2011-06-04 12:38:00,62,"Actually Roy, my Harbercraft is an exciting shade of stupid beige.  I don't think anything matches beige."
589704,Roy,2011-06-04 12:48:00,13728,"You'll be fine then, Dave. You have a bird and nothing matches that either."
588791,Canadave,2011-06-01 14:56:00,62,I did a lot of research and finally decided to buy a Humminbird 570 DI to replace my 9 year old Lowrance X65 that bit the dust last Fall.  I found a review comparing it to the Lowrance Mark 5X DI or whatever and the review said they were comparable but the Humminbird had more pixels.  Does anyone have any knowledge or experience with this Humminbird or DI technology?
588844,johnnyb,2011-06-01 16:52:00,3413,Sorry sir....not going to share all of my valuable input with a lowly MINNOW

588861,coreyhkh,2011-06-01 17:12:00,163,"I got the 700 version With DI and GPs and love it, its pretty simple to use just read the book or just take it out for a day and play around with it."
588903,Spiel,2011-06-01 19:01:00,9065,"I tend to refer to them as ""sonar units, ""Dufus""!"
588906,Roy,2011-06-01 19:08:00,13728,"Did you get the grey one or the black one, Dave? I think black would go better with your brown fishing rod."
588909,Spiel,2011-06-01 19:16:00,9065,"  Wouldn't his black rod be a better match with either the black or grey scale, just thinking out loud."
588912,Spiel,2011-06-01 19:22:00,9065,"Oh and I fixed it so they won't call you ""MINNOW"" anymore Dave."
588913,Roy,2011-06-01 19:22:00,13728," Jeez that opens up a whole other list of possibilities, Chris. What colour is that Harbercraft of yours Dave? I don't remember. Seems to me it was white and blue in which case you might be better off with the grey sonar."
588915,Spiel,2011-06-01 19:29:00,9065,"  I thought it was Fushcia, or something along those lines. Could be a clash issue all round I think."
588918,Headhunter,2011-06-01 19:33:00,5703,Maybe the OP would like to borrow one of my Hawaiian shirts! He's bound to find a colour match there! HH

588926,mercman,2011-06-01 19:55:00,7054,Is it winter again I'm afraid to look out the window now   
588932,aplumma,2011-06-01 20:10:00,6896,Don't worry about the color of the unit Dave just put it in the purse that matches the boat and they won't know the difference. If you post a few screen shots from it I will help you figure it out.   Art
588961,GBW,2011-06-01 21:50:00,8460,the rainbow sticker on the back is a nice accent piece too
589010,Fish Farmer,2011-06-01 23:21:00,2234,"Dave don't listin to those guys, You still have the best boat on the water  . But Dufus, I wouldn't take that."

589213,Cast-Away,2011-06-02 16:45:00,790,Careful Spiel and Roy and the mods will come after you for picking on someone
589215,Spiel,2011-06-02 16:50:00,9065," LOL....If Dave wants to join us at Lakair I'll gladly give him a chance to kick my ass, I win. Battle of the minds, I'll concede quickly."
589422,Canadave,2011-06-03 13:08:00,62, Thanx for the input guys.  I feel a lot more confident now about having made the correct decision based on my sartorial expertise.  The Humminbird 570 only comes in black which fortunately co-ordinates quite smartly with my spark plug wires.  The yellow trim on it is a tad too gay for my liking ... not that there's anything wrong with that.
589427,Canadave,2011-06-03 13:18:00,62, What the hell's a sufud?  Hey Corey ... How can you afford the 700 series?  Did you finally get a job or did your mother lend you the money as a Christianing present?
589431,Canadave,2011-06-03 13:24:00,62, Hmmm ... I finally figured out Sufud.  That's much better ... I think.
