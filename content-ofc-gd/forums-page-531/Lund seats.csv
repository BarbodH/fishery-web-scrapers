589763,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-06-04 17:36:00,1107,The reg seats are comfy but the air ride would be really nice on rough days I have had a few spine crushers in the rough stuff and the air ride would have helped .
589764,Terry,2011-06-04 17:49:00,14456,the lund airride isn't as good as some of the aftermarket makes but it ain't bad...... and it does make a difference
589766,irishfield,2011-06-04 18:05:00,26272,Lund doesn't make them.. they are either Atwoods or Springfields. I have both in my boat. The rear seats are Atwoods. Front captains the other.
589767,Terry,2011-06-04 18:06:00,14456,or lund doesn't make them...LOL
589769,irishfield,2011-06-04 18:10:00,26272,I'm sure Brunswick probably owns both companies Terry !!
589804,Dan668,2011-06-04 20:39:00,1120,"Srt8, I'm assuming the reg seats are fixed as in they don't raise/lower? Never really paid attention. Me being young am not worried one bit if its a rough ride. Just looking out for my dad. If someone else  manufactures lunds pedestals, without the upgrade I could buy the springfield pedestal, I'd just be without the lund pro seats right? Hard decision, the boat itself costs enough, you could continously be upgrading lol."
589805,Terry,2011-06-04 20:44:00,14456,yeah   all I know a buddy had factory air seats in a lund one broke he got an aftermarket **something* Glide it was called and it was twice the seat of the original one
589806,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-06-04 20:52:00,1107,"yes aftermarket are way cheaper and you can mount your lund seats on them,The regular seats are just swivel but the impact I saw at the show had nicer seats than my rebel could have been upgades though"
589807,Dan668,2011-06-04 20:59:00,1120,"Ok that's good to know. From what I've heard the reg lund seats are comfy, I think later on ill get the aftermarket pedestal, since I also heard the lund air pedestals only last 2-3 years. Thanks for the help!"
