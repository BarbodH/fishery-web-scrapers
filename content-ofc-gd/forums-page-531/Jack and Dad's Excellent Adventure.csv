The day started off miserable, wind gusts up to 70kmh, wet and cold. But by 6:30pm the sun was starting to poke through and looking at the waves on the lake the wind was dropping fast.  I asked Jack if he wanted to go down the lawn and fish...he said ""No"". I was left dissappointed for about 3 seconds because he then pipes up..."" I dont want to fish at Wahgoon lake, (this is how he says Wabigoon Lake) i wanna go to Dore Lake""  Ok...so off we went. We went to a lake near Dore lake Called Burr Lake as there is no real shore fishing access on Dore. Jack was having none of it....Burr lake is Dore lake too according to him.  All the way there Jack was excited about going to Dore so he could make holes with the ice auger again...lol...he remembered our trip there in February. After explaining it was all water now he became excited about catching ""Wiggly Walleyes""   Here's a photo and video account of our little adventure yesterday evening.   HALFWAY DOWN THE PATH TO THE LAKE I ASKED JACK IF HE WAS OK...HIS RESPONSE........      TURNED OUT TO BE A BEAUTIFUL EVENING (FOR THROWING ROCKS)                     DID NOT TAKE LONG FOR THE FIRST ""WIGGLY WALLEYE"" EITHER, JACK HAD NOT SEEN A STRINGER BEFORE AND FOUND IT VERY AMUSING FOR ABOUT 1/2 AN HOUR.                          THE NEXT 2 HOURS JACK DEMONSTRATED WHAT AN ACCOMPLISHED FISHERMAN HE'S BECOMING                     HERE'S SOME VIDEO  <iframe width=""560"" height=""349"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/nOkcyxP2LMQ"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>   I'm not sure whether he actually likes fishing, but he certainly likes being outside....he never wants to leave! In fact i was anticipating a meltdown at 9pm when i suggested we head home, nope, just...""ok Dad"". Love the little guy sooooo much its hard to put into words  So this morning while i'm typing this at work(slow day) i get a call from mum saying pick up minnows on the way home as jack wants to take mum and dad to ""dore lake"" again this evening.....PERFECT!"

My kids are the same way, never want to leave and want to fish everyday. I love it too, but I must admit, some days we go just to satisfy their needs, lol.  That kid of yours is gonna have alot of skills and a ton of pleasure in life, all because his Dad/Mom took the time to do things right.  Good on ya.  Now bring Jack this way I'm sure my kids would love to meet him! lol"
