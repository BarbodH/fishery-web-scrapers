589117,dhickey,2011-06-02 04:13:00,1038,Heading out with my cuzz next week but we seem to see things different. I want to go out looking for Pike and Muskie and he seemes to be focused on Crapie and eyes.  This is a maiden voyage of his boat that his father passed down to him seing as he has retiered from a fishing carier that would make most drop to thier knees and worship. This boat hasnt seen water in 10yrs. (watertite) set up.  So Im looking for a little advice as to where the big girls like to play seing as I wont have all day to focus on them and it would certainly be nice to get some slime in the boat again.  I should mention that I personly have never fished Scugog late spring.? Only been out there late August twice 15yrs ago.  A little advice would be very welcome.  Thanks. Saltydawg.

This map has some suggestions for areas to target specific species of fish.  Musky are orange, walleye are yellow."

589122,adempsey,2011-06-02 05:26:00,1498,Was just referring to the map.   There wasn't a legend showing what fish were what on this particular map.

589348,dhickey,2011-06-03 02:10:00,1038,Thanks for your replies.  My comment towards Fishlogic last nite was out of line and I apologise for it . I have since taken a second look at the advice that was sudjested to me and found it to be useful as a good starting piont for my day trip to Scugog. Thank you.  I have been thinking that top water lures may be the way to go on such a shalow lake. Has anybody fished Scugog late spring for muskie?  Does live bait work? And what is the average size for each type of fish?

Also, thanks for the advice on storing the brookies.. Cheers!"
