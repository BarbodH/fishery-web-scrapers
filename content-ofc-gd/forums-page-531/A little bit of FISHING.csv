589691,Billy Bob,2011-06-04 11:12:00,5865,"I got all worked up with Canadian Brother ""Wiser's"" Lake Erie Perch Report...after a quick PM to him he responded almost immediately on a general area where the boats were gathering on the Canadian side near my area of the lake....But a good high school buddy wanted to go and he didn't have a Canadian license....well after a few calls to my fishing friends it was confirmed that the perch school was so large on the Buffalo end of Lake Erie that it not only included the Canadian shoreline but all the way back to the NYS shoreline....that's one HUGE SCHOOL OF PERCH out there....  But wait...after I made the arrangements with my buddy John and telling my wife when she got home, she remarked ""Don't you have a important eye doctor appointment tomorrow....DAMN...  she was right....I even had the boat hooked on the truck already and went to the Niagara River for FRESH LAKE ERIE EMERALD SHINERS...and caring for them like a new born baby with lots of fresh water and my Mino-Mizer runnning 24/7 to keep the bait alive...anyone who's used emerald shiner knows they die if you look cross eyed at them....  So now what.....My only luck is I have a 7:20 am appointment but this eye doctor specialist office is busier then a 2 pecker billy goat...LOL  I arrive 45 minutes early to my appointment and tell a small white fishing lie to the receptionist, saying I came in early because they moved up my work schedule and REALLY need to see the doctor first if all possible....it's been my 4th or 5th visit here because I had a VERY bad iritis in my right eye and the receptionist really felt bad each time I was there, and the last time I got a shot right in the eye....so she said to me ""I'll see what I can do""....I was out of there by 7:40 am...  John called in sick and was now concerned that we were leaving later then usual and that someone might see me pick him up at his house with my boat...he works for the village....  So I run by his house with my wifes car (she walked to work so I could do this) pull in his driveway, he jumps in and off to my house (1 mile) to park the car and jump into the truck with boat in tow....  All this just to go perch fishing....  But anyways it was worth it....the fish were not on the bite even though we found them by the thousands on the bottom under the boat....but anchoring over them and with a very slow lift and drop of our baits we could BARELY feel them hanging on....much like ice fishing...no hits whatsoever. I think the VERY HIGH winds we had Wednesday put them off a bit...      This last picture you can see my line dropping down to them...  Bottom line we caught a LOT but there were a LOT of small ones we had to sort through....not the norm for Lake Erie....we must of caught 50-60 in the four hours we fished but ended up with 36 LARGE ones...  I almost forgot to take picture of the catch and was almost done filleting them when I remembered...so here's just a few of the ones we did keep. "

589694,Roy,2011-06-04 11:51:00,13728,"Methinks that BBQ of yours will be working overtime very soon. It appears as though the water just has a slight chop but the sonar image is really choppy on bottom. Using a small tinny? Congrats on the catch, sounds like a fun time."
589699,Billy Bob,2011-06-04 12:33:00,5865,"Roy it does look somewhat calm but that's deceiving from the picture. The marine forecast called for light and variable  but instead we got a west, southwest wind with a 1-2 foot chop by the end of the day...we were 6.36 miles out from the launch. But with the waves to our transom on the way back it was a decent ride back. On the way there it was much calmer with a 3/4 throttle against the wind cruising at about 25 mph.  My Grumman is a pretty heavy aluminum boat....16'4"" with a 84"" beam and it's 39"" deep....good boat for the Great Lakes but small enough for the inland lakes to use my bow mounted TM.  Weather looks great for fishing today but I have a family picnic to attend...  and tomorrow I promised the bride a ride out into the country...  Oh well, she worth it..."
589739,mercman,2011-06-04 15:39:00,7054,"Nice going Bob !!! We got into them today too.Took us a while to find them, but we did. Caught about 20 dinks, then found some of the bigger ones.Caught a 24"" pike swimming through the school, then the bite died.We were out for about 4 hours, now off to the licence bureau to renew my drivers licence.  Goo going Bobby !!!   Paul  "

589748,Billy Bob,2011-06-04 16:05:00,5865,"A LOT of credit goes to fellow OFC member ""Wiser"" because he steered me to the Buffalo end of Lake Erie...usually I like to go out of the Catt on Lake Erie which is about 45 miles west of where we fished yesterday....and the Buffalo end is only about 10-12 miles from my house...  big difference in truck gas...  Thanks Again Wiser, Bob"
