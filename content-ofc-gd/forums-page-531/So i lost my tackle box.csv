589110,Entropy,2011-06-02 03:29:00,747,He never did say where and when he lost it.  Could have been the one I picked up. lol
589119,dhickey,2011-06-02 04:38:00,1038,That realy sucks. lesson of the day is to put tackle in the back seat of the cab or at the verry least the front of the box. I had my tackle box stolen out of my boat along with my first quality rod when I was about your age talk about a pissed off young man.. On the bright side your still young .  Speaking for myself I think I have given away most of what I have bought and kept only those that work. I am not a rubber guy...  
589120,otter649,2011-06-02 04:59:00,118,"This fella lost his tacklebox almost 3 years ago (June 10, 2008) so he has probably overstocked it since then....."
589135,lookinforwalleye,2011-06-02 10:59:00,4399,How and why do you guys dig up 3 year old threads!!
589241,Entropy,2011-06-02 19:24:00,747,"It was me, I was looking for an old post, and found this.  Like I said it could have been the one I found.  When and Where?  Entropy"
589243,aplumma,2011-06-02 19:37:00,6896,I sent a P.M. to Bassman 11 and told him to contact Entropy to discuss this. Thanks for checking and we can let this one drift back down the line.
214033,BassMan11,2008-06-11 02:58:00,583,"So basically my truck tailgate wasn't locked down so it opened and i lost everything. Since i have to re-stock... any lures that are a must have? Mainly for bass and pike but i will take into consideration just about anything. I have a lot of the common ones written down (jitterbug , spook, fat wrap, crankbaits) just seeing what some of you guys killem' on. Thanks  Cheers  Mac"

214038,BillM,2008-06-11 03:09:00,17367,"I like the Zara Spook Jr's for both bass and pike, don't forget some spinnerbaits while you're at it  The Spook Jr's have internal rattles, one thing the normal size lacks."
214042,HTHM,2008-06-11 03:17:00,4082,"I don't know what did you usually TROLL with? If my box was lost, I could replace it from memory. If y0ou want to ask what my go-to lure is, I would say red devil spoon for pike, and jerk baits for most other species. Good luck on the water!"
214046,Greencoachdog,2008-06-11 03:25:00,8163,Live bait works well for me!

214084,Victor,2008-06-11 11:15:00,1609,Another vote for mepps spinners (Aglias/blackfurys) ... and maybe some spinnerbaits also
214120,sully,2008-06-11 12:13:00,40,Bassman11  You know.... I have a huge tackle box and in it I keep 3 spare reels so typically my tackle box is worth alot of coin if I were to loose it. Maybe contact your insurance people and see what they say...who knows  they might be sympathetic Depends on your deductable though...  just a  thought good luck
214177,Reef Runner,2008-06-11 15:29:00,980,SPINNERBAITS and release tools.  'nuff said.

214338,BabyHerc,2008-06-11 23:23:00,285,He didn't lose his box.  Just wants to know go-to lures without actually asking.  Everyone here could replace their box from memory if need be.  1/2 oz spinnerbaits and 6 inch plastic worms.

One of the worst feelings in my 22 year old life. It seems the mepps get a lot of talk. Never really used a lot but all good ideas. Thanks guys. thse ideas are great.

215310,lunkerbasshunter,2008-06-13 22:14:00,2585,"dude if i lost my tackle box i would totally call the amber alert people and have everyone in the country hearing the description, colour, what was in it.  maybe do some radio ads, definatly some tv. 680 news would have a update every 10 minutes on the 1's on the description. put up posters on telephone poles around marinas, boat launches, on the 401.  take out ads on OFC, start a have you seen this tackle box campaign all over the internet, maybe print ads on the back of big rigs!  have border patrol doing spot checks.  holy cow i woud be freakin lost without my tackle box lol  just kidding, hope you didnt have to much invested in your box?  i know i have at least $700 in mine so i would be super p-----  Cheers!"
