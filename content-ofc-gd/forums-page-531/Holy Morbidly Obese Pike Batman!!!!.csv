589284,DRIFTER_016,2011-06-02 23:21:00,10439,Found this pic today of a hefty pike caught in one of the little lakes inside the city limits this past Monday.  
589285,Terry,2011-06-02 23:25:00,14456,wow big head and fat for a short fish
589288,cram,2011-06-02 23:30:00,1733,"Super hefty.  Sure its not from up north or earlier in the season?  Those trees look bare, and the grass yellow."
589289,DRIFTER_016,2011-06-02 23:32:00,10439, Looks like it could swallow a basketball!!!  The lake is ony 1.2 kms X .75 kms at it's widest points!! I knew the lake holds pike and whitefish but had no idea it produced piggies!!! It was caught from shore right by the highway. May have to drop the zodiac in and fish it hard.
589291,DRIFTER_016,2011-06-02 23:35:00,10439," Yep it's from up North here in Yellowknife. And yes our grass is still brown, trees bare and Great Slave Lake is still over 95% covered with ice.  Plus it snowed today."
589300,cram,2011-06-03 00:10:00,1733," Sorry - I assumed you meant Toronto!  How toronto'ish of me (center of the universe, and all).   Sorry!!"
589301,Pigeontroller,2011-06-03 00:20:00,2793,"Nearly as effective as the ol' double eye hold, the lesser but still effective 'needle nose lip grip'!"
589303,DRIFTER_016,2011-06-03 00:22:00,10439," Yep, don't want to get all covered with snot now."
589312,super dave,2011-06-03 00:49:00,323,"You mean, there used to be whitefish in the lake"
589313,g_clot,2011-06-03 00:52:00,104,WOW... just... WOW.
589324,blarg,2011-06-03 01:39:00,289,"That looks like Jackfish lake, right off the road? I have caught tons of pike in that lake, and seen some big ones.  I broke a rod beaching a 10 lber there."
589338,DRIFTER_016,2011-06-03 01:55:00,10439,"  Yep, it is. I had no idea it grew pike that big in there.     :dunno: I haven't fished it because I thought the pike would all be small due to the lakes size. I guess I was wrong."
589343,cram,2011-06-03 02:02:00,1733,those boys look awfully happy!!
589376,bassmaster4,2011-06-03 03:45:00,801,that thing definately ended up on their dinner table judging by how he is holding it...
589378,ctdd2006,2011-06-03 03:51:00,531, probly...but I'm assuming the law sez he's legal to do so and those boys will remember that forever!  I say good on them...enjoy and once they become avid/addicted like most of us here maybe the next one goes back...there's a learning curve to everything and we've all kept or killed one that we wish we hadn't.
589379,bassmaster4,2011-06-03 03:53:00,801,"well said, i 100% agree with you on that"
589388,blarg,2011-06-03 05:45:00,289," And seeing as that is the nwt where the fishing is as good as you can imagine, especially for pike, i don't think its a problem.  Pike that size are common place on great slave lake, it's not as though it's say lake Nipissing where the fishing isn't as advertised and only getting worse."
589390,blue pickeral,2011-06-03 08:58:00,267,"If you're out for a drive by Ft. Rae, stop at Stag River, hook up a rusty nail to a piece of string and catch pike all day...no slime on the NWT pike and good to eat."
