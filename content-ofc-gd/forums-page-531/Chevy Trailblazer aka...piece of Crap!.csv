589349,e-z-out,2011-06-03 02:18:00,1052,I have a 2003 Trailblazer LS with 192000kms and the only problem is my remotes wont work now. Problem solved cost $0 bad ground wire.  It's been a great truck from day 1 but it is a pig on gas that's my only problem
589358,Henricus,2011-06-03 02:39:00,118,"Put a 190,000 km's on an '03 Envoy in 8 years and loved it.  Other than regular maintenance, never had it serviced....except for the catalytic converter in '07...towing back a buddies boat bought in 'bama we were about the 3rd vehicle over a deer around Toledo.  By Woodstock the truck pretty much died.  Called the GM dealer in Woodstock, they came picked up the truck, then the boat, fixed it in a couple of hours and had us on our way again - truly fantastic service.  Although they asked rather sheepishly why there were some sort of 'body parts' pulled from the catalytic converter so we explained the deer thing.  By the way, covered under warranty!  If the non-XL had the 3rd row I would have definitely bought another one.  Great tow vehicle although definitely not known for good mileage.  Decided to buy a new-to-me Yukon for the 3rd row and towing capacity....what a great tow vehicle but again, gas mileage not great.  Tows my boat with ease which is around 3500lbs.  Have driven nothing but GM vehicles for over 20 years and never had a major problem and rarely a minor one."
588816,muskymatt,2011-06-01 15:59:00,2608,"I have a 2005 Trailblazer, with 4x4  and have never in my life owned such a piece of complete total garbage.  It has cost me over $10k in the last 18 months and now my A/C is kaput and also my 4x4 transfer case is broken.  I have maintained this truck well since I got it in 2006, and now on top of the amount I paid for it, and the over $10k I have already put out(not even including the warranty work of over $7200)< now I could possibly be hit for another $4000.  Has anyone else had issues like this, I'm not sure I can afford to keep it, and it's paid off....    People...stay away from Chevy Trailblazers...they suck you dry.....complete total garbage product.....be forwarned   "

588885,10point,2011-06-01 18:24:00,165,I also have a 2005 Trailblazer and ironically I am having A/C issues myself. Keeps going out and they can't find where its leaking.
588894,dave524,2011-06-01 18:41:00,4508,"Sorry for your grief.    I actually went to a lot a few months ago with serious intentions on buying a low mileage 2006 Trailblazer, They had sold it the day before and ended up with cutesy Jeep Liberty, that at least makes my feel a bit better about the outcome that day  Crossing my fingers on the Libby"
588905,tdotfisherman,2011-06-01 19:04:00,317,"I have the ""Cousin"" vehicle to the Trailblazer the GMC Envoy and I really enjoy it. Powerful engine, 4x4, nice ride, nice features, not too many problems, the only con is that the Envoy isnt the greatest on gas, but for 275 horsepower I'll accept that loss."
588908,Roy,2011-06-01 19:11:00,13728,I have a 2005 GMC Jimmy. Never any issues with it. It's perfect for towing the boat.

589002,Billy Bob,2011-06-01 23:06:00,5865,"Sorry to hear your bad luck....sounds a lot like my experience's with GM and Ford....had over 15 brand new vehicles over the years (never a new Dodge, Chrysler or Plymouth, but several used ones)....always within the first 24 months issues began....Ford was usually pretty good with warranty service (not perfect) but GM was BRUTAL....In 2007 I decided to purchase another new truck but this time I did a lot of online research and decided to go with a Toyota Tundra....I have had it 4 YEARS now and it's only been back to the dealer for a front driver's side tire sensor that FIRESTONE broke putting on new tires back in October '10.... I do my own oil changes and lube the drive train, plus rotate my own tires....other then that NOTHING...best VEHICLE I have ever owned.....since then I purchased my wife a Honda Civic two years ago...it also has not been to the dealer except for a FREE (my favorite 4 letter work) oil change....  But I do keep hearing Detroit has gotten better with quality and dependability since I purchased my Tundra....but that ship has sailed for me....I am sold on my Toyota Tundra....BTW it's made here in the USA.  Bob"
589006,pics,2011-06-01 23:15:00,1268,Toyota Trucks are made in Texas...I have a Chev Colorado and I wouldn't recommend it just because of the brake design that most shops don't want to deal with....a cheap shop will probably be $1000 just for rotors and pads...
589023,Nipfisher,2011-06-01 23:58:00,2449,"Worst vehicle my family evere owned was a 1992 Cherolet Lemona (aka Lumina). It was a peice of crap. Everything from the factory paint fading to a dull yellow (was white of the lot) to multiple drive train issues, engine issues and oh ya the AC was crap.    I love my Ford. Yes it has flaws but the dealership is good and fixes it as needed."

Mind you I've only every had a Chevette, Cavalier, and now a Silverado.  No issues, but yes I have heard many terrible things about the Trailblazer."
