36519,Mike Colaneri,2007-02-19 21:33:00,9,"Howdy Folks!  First time poster, long time lurker......  Well, I've visited numerous boards and found this one to be the most entertaining.  I guess a little about myself: Grew up in Thunder Bay, 21 years, sparked my interest for the outdoors. Currently living in Ottawa, have a cottage on White Lake, love fishing for Large Mouth Bass with my Lovley Wife and Son.  Looking forward to posting outings soon.  Stay Safe!"
