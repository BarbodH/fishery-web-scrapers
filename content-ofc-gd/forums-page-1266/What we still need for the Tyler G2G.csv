36333,Big Cliff,2007-02-19 12:47:00,6899,Will the town have portapotties there then Moe? Seems if they are having their winterfeast thing they should make some provision for people that have to go.

36416,JFR,2007-02-19 16:25:00,498,"I have a line on some styro-foam plates as well as plastic utensils, tell me how many you think we will need and what utensils and consider them supplied.  I will get 5# onions and chop them.  I also have my two 20# propane tanks and hoses. I am also bringing by propane smoker/oven to keep food warm and ready to finish grilling.  Sausages and hot dogs, could be steamed before putting on the grill for final cooking.  Burgers can be partially cooked, then placed in a pan in the oven and then finished before serving  The chiken pieces can be warmed in another pan.  This will cut down on tyring to cook everything at once.  I know it works, at a family re=union this summer we did the same thing and there was not problems.  John "
