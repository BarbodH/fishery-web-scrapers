37208,tjsa,2007-02-21 00:56:00,1578," Its just for fun, thats it, thats all. You get to see a lot of great fish pics posted of some really nice catches, and at the end of it, some prizes will be awarded at a swill in december, along with computer generated awards with your name on it that you can frame if you like.  But, its mostly just for fun. No cash prizes. And, we get to heckle and barb other teams, to a certain extent of course. Nothing nasty, keep it civil."
