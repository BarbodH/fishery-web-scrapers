37700,BFSC Kevin,2007-02-21 21:05:00,1351,"under the panfish category, im guessing out of all the panfish species, it will only be 1 fish that will get the top spot out of all of them? for example, although my crappie is 14inch and his perch is 15inch, only the perch will count? thanks for the help."
37714,GbayGiant,2007-02-21 21:15:00,1780,"I guess it's not to technical, just fun, because the smallmouth and largemouth are in the same category to, I'm guessing a largmouth will easily win."
37723,huntervasili,2007-02-21 21:30:00,1604,Yup Kevin... I am pretty sure it is one fish per category and as bigger ones are caught it is replaced...
37728,Bernie,2007-02-21 21:46:00,3190,So its quality-not quantity.
37743,walleyejigger,2007-02-21 22:04:00,876, it's the length that counts not the girth
