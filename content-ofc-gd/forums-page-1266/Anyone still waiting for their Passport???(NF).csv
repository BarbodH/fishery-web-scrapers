35301,Nemo,2007-02-16 13:17:00,727,Anyone trying to get a passport for March Break. We sent my daugters in before Christmas (Dec 20) and still have no news. Our VISA was billed two weeks ago but still nothing.  We also cannot get through to a live body on the phone. It just cuts you off.  We are travelling on Mar 11th and would hate to cancel the trip because we cant get her passport. That would be a drag.  Anyone know how to get in touch with the Passport Office?  Anything that has worked in getting this resolved?  Your thoughts suggestions appreciated.

35314,pigeonfisher,2007-02-16 13:39:00,696,"Nemo, you will have your passport back within a few days.  They were processing Dec. 21 on Monday, so yours will be in the mail this week.  I have been on the phone with them everyday this week.  Mine is being sent fedex to Mississauga to be processed on monday.  DANG"
35334,pigeonfisher,2007-02-16 14:04:00,696,I am on my daily phone call with them now.  I will let you know what date they are processing today...The key to getting on the phone is to keep calling for a few minutes and push 1_1_1 to get to an operator
35352,Nemo,2007-02-16 14:37:00,727,Thanks PF I will call the Missus. I posted cause I knew you had posted on this.  I knew someone here would have an answer.   Misfish.
35380,walleyejigger,2007-02-16 16:04:00,876,"my bro's still waiting, apllied dec 1  supposed to be in china right now, he's tried calling several times a day every day since new years and hasn't gotten thru once, i'll let him know about 1-1-1"
35384,pigeonfisher,2007-02-16 16:15:00,696,"As I said, I call every day (for the last couple of weeks). I always get someone within a few minutes of calling."
35400,lilkynan,2007-02-16 17:05:00,173,Got mine last Feb 8 - took 4 days to get. Cost an extra $30 - but I got it
36914,Nemo,2007-02-20 16:52:00,727,So far no passport.  Is there anyway to call them and get a status report from them?  We have tried getting through but no luck.  PF have you got yours yet?
36952,John,2007-02-20 18:37:00,2956,"Nemo, as PF suggested, persistence pays off. Keep calling.......you will get through.  We have all known about the requirement for at least a year now!"
37047,pigeonfisher,2007-02-20 21:21:00,696,"I don't expect mine until Friday.  But I have some faith in the system, i spoke to a person, he said he would get it done.  I believe him.  Keep calling, you will get through."
37051,Nemo,2007-02-20 21:27:00,727,"Yep fingers crossed PF.....  John, as for knowing about the requirement that is fine.  What p's me off is we follow the passport offices recommendations and accept their service level estimates (20 days) and then they unplug the phone (so to speak) and add 45 days to the estimate. If I had known this we would have taken it in and paid for the rush service. Is passport Canada going to refund my airfare etc?  Frankly not acceptable. Maybe I should do the same at tax time but I would probably find myself in court.  Just seems that taxes go up, service levels and accountability evaporate."
37265,fishless,2007-02-21 01:59:00,82,hey mine arrived today now i can go to spring training in lakeland florida.it took 18 days from passport office to my home.i am really suprized at that.go tigers
37271,icefisherman,2007-02-21 02:26:00,952,"Guys I don;t understand why so late for you...I've sent the documents for my wife's and my son's passports on Jan 16 and got them back on the 7 of Feb. I went in person to the Mississauga office. A bil longer then usual but about 20 days before they travel to Europe. There is a trick to get to live operator - do not press the button to check status but go for ""quaetions about your application"" The person who answers can get you all the info.  Hope this helps Nemo and th rest of you still waiting...  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
37348,Nemo,2007-02-21 03:42:00,727,Well tonight we called at 7:30 and instead of 1-1-1 we pushed 1-1-0. Get into a queue of 25. On hold for 35 minutes and got a live body.  They have no record of it and can't find it. They will call us back in 2 days they say when they find it.  Huh...
37359,irishfield,2007-02-21 04:03:00,26272,Hope it works out Nemo. Last year I got my renewal in 4 days and Leah's...well we had to cancel our trip to the Caribean because her's didn't arrive 'till a week after we were to leave.
37361,Nemo,2007-02-21 04:07:00,727,Thanks IF that's what I'm worried about.  Not me so much but the kids will be pretty upset if we have to cancel.
