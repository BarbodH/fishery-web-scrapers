37052,Keota,2007-02-20 21:27:00,1,I am planning a fishing trip in June to the Pipestone/Clearwater/Despair chain of lakes. I was wondering if anybody has fished these waters and what they experienced. If anybody has and would like to share opinions on what lakes to fish or not to fish and what species are most available that would be great.

Unlike some of the larger lakes, both shores are always visible. Reefs are few and marked. No navigational charts are needed on these waters.  Clearwater (Burditt) Lake Our home lake is 77' at the deepest. Excellent bass, northern, perch, and walleye. Muskie hunters should head for the north end of the lake.  Pipestone Lake A short ride over a mechanical portage and you are on one of the areas deepest lakes.  Up to 275' deep. Great for trout, muskie, bass, walleye and northerns.  Many local people say that Pipestone hold's the world record Muskie."
