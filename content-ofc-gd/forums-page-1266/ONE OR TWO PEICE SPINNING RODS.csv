36829,rob v,2007-02-20 14:06:00,535,I'm planning on purchasing a new rod this spring and I was hoping I could get a few opinions on the subject from some of the members who have experience with one peice rods.  I have a one peice bait casting outfit that I really like.  The only problem I have is that it's a pain in the butt to pack and travel with.  For those of you who prefer the one peice - how do you manage travelling with them ?  Thanks very much for the insite.  Rob V
36830,Terry,2007-02-20 14:09:00,14456,"one piece rods are more sensitive, IMHO and if you bend a 2 piece rod you will see the natural curve of the bend is changed where they join but 2 piece sure is better for traveling and storage so it's a trade off, and most times I don't see that much difference, so I go with the 2 piece rod"
36833,OhioFisherman,2007-02-20 14:14:00,6623,"I have a lot of rods, don`t think I have a two piece, if I have it`s gathering dust in the barn. Mine are in the rod locker of the boat or in the van if I am shore fishing. I even carried them in my chevette for fishing trips. Just have to be careful with them, I don`t have many that are less than 6 feet, and they don`t get used much.  The quality of 2 piece rods has gone up over the years though."
36835,Raf,2007-02-20 14:16:00,3495,most of mine are 1pc.  you buy a vehicle where they can fit!
36836,danbo,2007-02-20 14:17:00,2646,Ditto What Terry said..
36845,muskieb,2007-02-20 14:22:00,58,I have wondered the same but in regards to heavy muskie rods.  Has anyone had problems with the two piece rods failing at the joint?  Often wondered if they were weaker than a one piece.
36911,Fishn Technishn,2007-02-20 16:44:00,198,"I have a few 2 piece rods but much prefer the 1 piece over them. Am especially fond of St.Croix -both Premier & Avid. I broke down & bought a ""Bazuka"" to hold up tp 7 rods( with out reels) & have NO regrets. I put a home made ""sock"" on each rod & in they go...No worries after that. The Bazuka is almost crush proof & says it is AIRLINE PROOF ... whatever that means. I pack all my reels into a used camera bag I got for $2 at a yard sale(GREAT!) Don't get me wrong, 2 piece rods have their place but all being equal I will reach for my 1 piece rods 1st!  I you are doing stream/river fishing 2 piece would be easier to travel with.  FT"
36921,Bernie,2007-02-20 17:09:00,3190, Agreed!
36935,JFR,2007-02-20 17:41:00,498,"I use two pc spinning and float rods, and do not seem to have lost any sensitivity.  lI have a 2pc musky rod (Diawa-Heartland) I haven't had a problem with it coming apart.  It is a nice rod for the low cost, but for musky fishing I prefer a one pc.  John"
36938,misfish,2007-02-20 18:03:00,29133, Yep me too...............................................What Terry said.LOL
36941,aplumma,2007-02-20 18:15:00,6896,"The only reason for a two pieces is if you need it to be short enough to pack otherwise a one piece beats it in all categories as far as strength,sensitivity,and weight.  Art"
36943,John,2007-02-20 18:18:00,2956,I always wondered why my buddies were putting up with transporting one piece rods. I tried one and never went back.
36970,zman,2007-02-20 19:18:00,179,I have always had 2pc roads untill 2 years ago and now I'll never buy a 2pc again love them
36976,mattyk,2007-02-20 19:23:00,2110,1 Piece.
36980,muskieb,2007-02-20 19:29:00,58,"Ok, so now I want the ultimate in sensitivety. So how do you suggest I transport a one piece 19' float rod?"
36998,Terry,2007-02-20 19:56:00,14456,you make a rod holder on the front bumper then you bend the rod over to the back bumper where you have a downrigger clip you clip the end of the rod and there you have it
37011,just2manylures,2007-02-20 20:13:00,144,I plan my packing around all my 1 peice outfits.  You aren't going to fish without a rod.  So its the most important part of your travel  my 2 cents  2many
37024,kemper,2007-02-20 20:31:00,2232,"Id say go with a good two peice, simple reason is for travel. Its too much of a hassle to transport something that is 7 feet long, and you're much more likely to bust in tin a car door."
37026,GbayGiant,2007-02-20 20:34:00,1780,"1 piece vote for me. Only bummer is packing it, or paying for the ridiculous shipping if you order one in the mail."
37035,mepps,2007-02-20 21:00:00,1301,"I use both, and dont notice a huge difference myself.  Since I got a nice long rodcase, i stick to 1 piece rods.  The biggest problem I have with 2peice rods is that they often come apart while casting really hard."
37077,tbayboy,2007-02-20 22:22:00,1497,Ive done that one too Mepps .  Gonna pick up a new single piece walleye rod this year but I've got a question - have any of you guys transported these single piecers (lets say a 6'6 or 7'er) via plane - any recommendations on the rod carriers you see at places like BPS?  I've got a trip up to NW ontario this summer and I'd love to bring up a nice rod but don't want to ruin it or pay a bunch extra to bring it up.
37080,Rich Clemens,2007-02-20 22:26:00,3131,"I had a few two piece spinning rods, but I found that I had to push them back together here and there during the day.  Could be that they were just cheap-o rods to begin with.  Now, I only use the 1-piece rods, none of which are anywhere near the length of your float rod.  With the long rods, I store them in the boat while traveling.  Should I need to stay over-night, I bring them into the motel room.  So far, I really enjoy the 1 piece and doubt I go back to the 2 piece."
37103,Greencoachdog,2007-02-20 23:08:00,8163,"  Buy the Airliner 4588 rod tube by Plano, transported my 7' rods from Atlanta Georgia to Lakair last with no problems! I have a few 2 piece rods but they are all over 10' in length. I can't stand making a long cast with a 6' rod only to have the top half go flying into the drink!!!... I hate that worse than a 'Possum hates an ax handle!!!"
37178,tjsa,2007-02-21 00:15:00,1578," and it also doubles as a CB antenna  I only use 2 piece, because of my type of fishing locations. My bud used a one piece for 2 years, and finally got tired of it getting caught up in all the brush and trees when going through the rough portages and trails we use.  A one piece would definatly be a better rod to use, but a higher risk of breaking them in some situations concerning storage to and from locations, portaging, etc."
