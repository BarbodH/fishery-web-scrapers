35521,silveradosheriff,2007-02-16 22:58:00,1025,$100 million bucks - that is hilarious!  I hope they sell beer.
35574,Garyv,2007-02-17 01:34:00,547,"Anything can be justified when there are those who believe.  Why don't they spend the $ on those in Canada that need food, shelter, clothing, and just plain help.  Seems to me that would be helping human rights more than some building in Winnipeg!"
35590,huntervasili,2007-02-17 02:59:00,1604,"Hmmm... that is 100 mil that could go to some much better use... Maybe low income family housing, and as mentioned, food and clothing for the needy... Or stick it into the MNR so we can have some more of our great CO's..."

To top things off, Winnipeg has tonnes of urban poor. Why not invest in the terrific Red River fishery and related recreational opportunities to boost tourism and create some real, sustainable, meaningful, satisfying jobs while improving our environment.  Politicians only listen to those who speak LOUDEST."
36769,Big Cliff,2007-02-20 10:47:00,6899,"It's our own fault! Almost anyone can get the Government to kick in money for nearly anything if you just yell loud enough, get petitions signed, and get in their faces! It happens almost everyday.  If you don’t feel that our money should be spent like that then you have a choice, you can sit around and whine about it and watch your/our money be used for whatever or you can make more noise, get more petitions signed, and be more in their face and have a say. You choose!"
36779,camillj,2007-02-20 11:36:00,1988,Wow ... I guess now I understand why they need my hard earned tax dollars so much more than my family does ...
