37355,Moosebunk,2007-02-21 03:59:00,3970,"Not much fishing, I mean catching, done lately.  Worked on some lures recently though.  20 Inline Spinners.  Average about 8-10 inches long, and 2-3 ounces in weight.  Beginning bucks were taking about 3 1/2 hours but the last 12 that were just finished up over the last week took about 30 hours only.  Tying isn't that slow, but because I used thicker steel shafts that still  wouldn't screw the action, (not the Real Pro Lure Making skinny crap) I had to drill out each bead.  That, and the saddle feathers, the glue setting in stages, the flashabou, dressing each treble... pretty much everything other than just tying the marabou and bucktail took extra time.  I used 750 to 800 meters of thread, 20 feet of wire, and 1 large bottle of laquer that quite frankly, I likely inhaled half of it.    Some of these buggahs I gave names while going along.    Orange and black one: Trick or Treat. Blue and pink one:  Rainbow Treasure. Yellow and Red one:  Mickey Finn.    Blue, purple and black lure:  Cold Steel Black, brown and gray:  Rusty Rat. Black and red lure:  Nightmare.    Brown, orange, yellow lure:  Charlie Brown Pumpkin Green and white:  Kermit.    Pink and white lure:  Miss Piggy Red, white and Blue:  Capitaino Americano Brown and yellow:  Pike Peanut Butter and Chocolate.   Next project, 50 inlines.  Sizes 3 to 5.  All single hooks dressed in popular fly and streamer patterns.  Just like the Europeans do. lol."
