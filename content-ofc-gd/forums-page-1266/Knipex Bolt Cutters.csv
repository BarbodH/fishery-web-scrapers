37053,bigbuck,2007-02-20 21:28:00,2449,"I'm new to musky fishing and have spent the past several months gearing up. What I need now are a pair of Knipex bolt cutters since I'm told those are the ones to get. Now my question is, which model # and/or size?? Thanks for the help."
37062,GbayGiant,2007-02-20 21:43:00,1780,Not sure of the model # but they are a 1 hand operation that fit in a fishes mouth nothing to big.   
37069,lew,2007-02-20 21:55:00,12767,"This is the one I use with the springloaded handle, it makes things a bit easier when they pop open themselves.  If you haven't found a supplier yet, I ordered mine from a company in Saskatchewan called Ringlord and had them in a couple days.  http://theringlord.com  "
37087,Pete Maina,2007-02-20 22:40:00,213,"HI,  We have all types of the Knipex at The Next Bite - Esox Angler magazine. They are the best quality cutters out there - and we've carried them since our inception. http://www.esoxangler.bigstep.com/category...l?UCIDs=1319729 Link to different types.  The lever action ones are not as strong (cutting power, but same quality) - but do offer a little better reach. The strongest are the cobolt ones that Lew recommended. Most folks like the one thats spring-loaded, but they come both ways. I carry both in the boat, using the cobolts the majority of the time.  I can't encourage folks enuf to make certain have quality cutters like these - and to just snip away any hooks that are in critical areas or just buried and tough to get out. Simply not worth the extra time required and potential (probable in many cases) additional damage to the fish.  Quicker is better.  Pete"
37095,bigbuck,2007-02-20 22:52:00,2449,"Thanks guys, at the Fishing Show over the weekend, no one knew where to get them here in Canada. I took a look at theringlord.com and found them there for about $68 Canadian delivered to my door with no surprise taxes/duties.  Jeez, I got replies from the Musky King of the North (Lew) as well as the Musky King of the South (Pete).  I'm hoping to spend some more time on the water this summer and my preference is to hunt Musky. Bass is fun, walleyes are great but Musky reigns supreme. I caught my first last summer up on LOTW and it was a snot rocket only about 22-24"" but WHAT A FIGHT!!!! I thought my St.Croix was going to go in the drink."
37097,Rich Clemens,2007-02-20 22:58:00,3131,"Go get 'em buck.   Remember to take your Camera.  The knipex I have are very similar to Lew's , but ain't got no spring.   I also tied a long string to mine and tie off the other end to the boat.  Sure would hate to see a slip of the hand and have them sink to the bottom.  Too many $$$ for that to happen."
37107,bigbuck,2007-02-20 23:12:00,2449,"Well, I just ordered them from theringlord.com. Shipped by expedited post to Toronto from Saskatoon for $67.77. I'll probably have them in the next 7-10 days here at the office."
37134,mepps,2007-02-20 23:39:00,1301,I think that link you left up there is incorrect lew...THEringlord.com
37152,lew,2007-02-20 23:53:00,12767," Thanks Clive, your absolutely correct, my mistake.......thanks.  I've corrected it now."
37167,camillj,2007-02-21 00:04:00,1988,Thanks Guys .. mine are on their way

The Niagara Musky Association will have a booth there, they just might have some Knipex cutters there for an unbeatable price! They sell them quite cheap, as they are highly dedicated to proper C&R practices."
