35670,Smokey,2007-02-17 14:18:00,1278,I came out only about 100 bucks lighter. Got a nice little soft side tackle box from LB's and 10 more mini power grip releases from Grimsby Tackle then renewed my OFAH membership while there. Other then that had a great day walking and chatting with all the ofner's and tackleshop personalities i've met over the years. They did have a few dealer reps there full of info for some up coming purchases.
35747,Carp,2007-02-17 21:14:00,1488,"I didn't attend and really had no plans to go, although it would have been nice to see some familiar faces. Money spent at the show = $0.00.  Spent the morning painting and I'll be moving furniture this evening before the hockey game. Right now, I'm off to see about getting new parts for my central vac. Tomorrow I'll be getting a few things ready for next weeks charity fishing tourney at Innisfil."
35801,PatrickGG,2007-02-18 01:03:00,562,"I gotta agree with Lew ""It ain't what it used to be"" Every year i see it getting more and more commercialized kinda like the sportsman show, but overall i spent almost undisclosed bucks well spent i picked up a Shimano Clarus 6""6"" Medium fast action rod and a shimano Curado 101d, 50 Pound Power pro line and a whole variety of rubber worms and jigs and some lures and strike king spinner baits to get me threw this year comfortably, I am happy with all the things i got, i wait every year for the show to splurge on fishing gear for the year but i think it will be my last year buying as much as i did, as for next year i will stick to buying the 5 for ten dollar table items and spinner baits.  P.S Man i don't know what the hell they put in the smokies this year but i had blurry vision after eating the third one   ."
36264,drufis,2007-02-19 03:23:00,45,"Originally I had my brother in law down for $350, well he went back to the show for more.  He is now up to $500 he just had to have a new tackle box and I guess since he was there he had to fill it.  Glad to hear everyone had a good time."
36297,kennyman,2007-02-19 05:14:00,737,"I know I didn't even come close to ""spending the most"" but here's what I got..... a Quantum Catylst (IM8) MH spinning rod (man is this thing thin and light for a MH),a Lindy big game spinnerbait (black/white/chrome), two beautiful Northamfishing spinner baits (perch and baby bass),a 9"" Trick Shiner musky/pike bait. Yatahe Tackle 50lb flourocarbon leaders,1/2 oz. white buzzbait and a pickerel rig  (trom a really nice knowledgeable older gentleman that hand makes these baits+has darn good success fishing...28 muskies last year!). I bought four packs of Berkley plastics so I could get the promotional gulp ""wormbinder"",a hat from Fishing World  for $2.99 ...great deal,thanks and one of the Plano soft tackle bags that were on sale at Lebarons.  I think that was all ...... actually I got a really nice free hat from the Quantum rep,after I bought the rod (really helpful,really nice guy). All in all I really enjoyed the show,especially Big Jim's muskie seminar. Just like everyone has said,there weren't a ton of killer deals,but if you looked for them,there were still some to be had ....... the selection was huge and the advice was great. If you have't been to one of these make a point to,you'll enjoy it."
36424,JFR,2007-02-19 16:38:00,498,"Other than the admission price and a cup of coffee, I left the show empty handed, which is a good thing....  I'll test the Sportsman's show this year  , but I saving my $$$ for the Odyessy.  John"
36808,muskiesRus,2007-02-20 13:17:00,18,I'm with you Mr JR! Waiting for the Odyssey. Better chance of gettin' some deals.
35071,drufis,2007-02-15 23:01:00,45,Hello All  Just got back from the fishing show.  It was nice to look at all the boats and just be around fishing on a cold day like today.  I was actually good and got out not spending any money and picked up a free hat.  But my brother in law did not have the same self control!  $350 later he walked out with two reels and rod.  Hope everyone had a good time.
35076,aplumma,2007-02-15 23:07:00,6896,put me down for spending $0.00 but only because it is to far away.  Art
35090,irishfield,2007-02-15 23:45:00,26272,$10 slice of pizza and a $3 pop should be my total expense.      Who am I kidding.....
35115,Jigger,2007-02-16 00:26:00,1237,"I only spent 150. At least thats what I told my wife  . Met Lew and Smokey, sorry I couldn't meet up with the rest of the crew. Nice to meet you two!"
35117,ch312,2007-02-16 00:29:00,1590,$0 for me this year. i usually spend over $150 but due to my house i cant even go this year
35168,snag,2007-02-16 02:06:00,1932,"I spent 0$ and left with 2 Spro lures, $30!!!  I'm not a thief.  The sales rep gave them to me after I told them how much I love their product but that I keep breaking them.  Visit the Spro folks. They have great product and are obviously a class act."
35190,Spiel,2007-02-16 02:43:00,9065,....I'll spend exactly $0.00. Not worth my time or money. I'd rather take the expense of going and visit my local tackle shop where every penny gets spent on tackle. But hey that's just me.
35194,Gerritt,2007-02-16 02:50:00,6129,"Spiel I agree!!!.... I might spend a couple at the ""garden"".... I go more for the fact I see what is new and up n' coming i might even have a slice of pizza....  but I do enjoy the seminars and just being there with a bunch of people that are like minded and looking around.... I honestly think if you are going there just for a deal of a lifetime.... you will be disappointed!  these firms are paying for the square footage, and the rest of the associated costs... and need to make money to pay for it all.... not to mention at the same time they are paying for their stores...  I hope that everyone here enjoys the show though!! even if you are just poking around   Gerritt."
35205,Crazyhook,2007-02-16 03:30:00,1154,"Iusually spend 10 bucks to get in, 10 for parking and 8 bucks for beef jerky stick  so 28 bucks for one small piece of beef"
35209,irishfield,2007-02-16 03:36:00,26272,I'll watch for you Jamie and have my hand out ready so I can pay for my pizza slice! LOL Parking is free !

35220,motv8tr,2007-02-16 04:36:00,2587,"I'm planning on spending on 12.00 to get my nephew in since Gary V was nice enough to give me the ticket he won.  but you know what they say about the best laid plans  I do expect to pay more for wings after though, that boy of mine sure does like to eat  Maureen"
35234,bpsbassman,2007-02-16 05:02:00,941,"Spent $8.00 at Fishing World on a Chatter Bait to replace the one I lost last year.... and of course one of their beauty hats for $2.99. Had the pleasure of talking to Lew, Deg and Ruth for a bit. Saw Pikeie fly by. Saw a few of my BPS buddies. Had a good chat with Dave Mercer, a real CLASS act. Stopped at the Memquisit booth to give them our deposit for the our fall trip to Nipissing and had a good chat with them I really don't expect to get spectacular deals, I just really enjoy chatting it up with people, doing some fact finding (this year was investigating new motors) and a night out with the guys.  Starts to get the blood flowing again.  Only a little more than 120 days till Lakair!"
35239,danbo,2007-02-16 05:13:00,2646,Dang! I just spend my spare cash on an electric guitar..can't afford the show now!
35259,lew,2007-02-16 09:26:00,12767,"I had an excellent day at the show !!  It's not what it used to be, but was a great way to spend a cold winter day and have a look at alot of the new products on the market.  I was there about 5 1/2 hours but spent most of the time yakking with all the OFNers that were there, plus several of the vendors that I know.  I didn't intend on buying much but picked up 2 baits from JB's that I wanted for $45 and that was it.  Yup, it was a great way to spend a day"
35264,Motorhead,2007-02-16 11:10:00,163,"Had a great day at the show with the wife.... I think we walked out of there a hundred bucks lighter, She got a new Rapala rod and reel and I picked up a few packs of plastic worms... All in all a good show, met a few OFC`rs and got to meet Darryl Chronzey in the beer tent.. Was fun, thanks TJ for the tickets  Doug"
35300,muskieb,2007-02-16 13:14:00,58,"A grand total of $220 for me, a new heavy action trolling rod and reel for dipsy divers and muskie baits.  Bring on the soft water season!"

If you see a guy that looks like this picture on the left only with drool and a slightly rabid look to him and has his credit card taped to his forehead do me a favour and block the path to the next booth please."
35475,spoonman,2007-02-16 21:07:00,103,I have been waiting almost a year but I finally bought the Lowarnce Global Map 3500 with the Navioics Gold chip. All said and done just under 900.  Had a great day. Cheers AL
35577,mikeh,2007-02-17 01:52:00,824,"I went on Thursday picked up two Eagle fishfinders the ds245 and ds250 at Lebarons for $131 and $181 , they have the no tax sale. At Fishing World I pick up some of the new Reaction Innovation flipping hooks, they are made by Gamakatsu and have welded eyes, I found with power pro my line would slip thru the eye once in a while and I would loose fish, these hooks eliminate this from happening(great product). also picked up some Evolution Jigs at Fishing World , that are designed to sit on the bottom with the hook facing up.  I also watched some seminars, and thought Barry Pringle and Mike Desforges did a good presentation and gave lots of good advice."
35662,bigbuck,2007-02-17 13:28:00,2449,"I ended up dropping about $80 or so. 300yds of 50lb PowerPro, a couple of Strike King Spinners, a Dick Pearson Grinder Musky Bait, a Storm soft bait, and a couple of the metal sparking fire starters. It was interesting watching Italo up on the stage. The guy is sooo smooth, he's been at it a long time. Gord Pyzer and Big Jim were great talking about musky and Mercer was fantastic to watch as well. An afternoon well spent."
