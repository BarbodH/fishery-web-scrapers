36508,spoonman,2007-02-19 21:12:00,103,"I managed to fish Sunday, at Jacksons Point with a good friend of mine Shaun. We arrived at the hut by 7:30 am and set up are spreaders and starting jigging with our ice rods. The Jigs only had one touch all day. The tip ups with spreaders on the bottom had all the action. Shaun was 0/2 with about 4 other hits. I went 1/3 with about 7 other hits. The fish seemed pretty fussy today. We were fishing in about 55-60FOW. The guys beside us had a good day as well, it was great to get out again.  Here are a couple pictures from our day out on Sunday     Al with a 7lb Whitefish   Cheers Al www.alsadventures.ca"
