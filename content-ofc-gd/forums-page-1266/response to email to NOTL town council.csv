Dear Sir    Please be aware that this is a small piece of land about 100â€™ X 50 where we have had challenges with security and so have the neighbours.  This land is not designated as a park and it is hoped that it will soon be used by Canada Customs as a secure area for cross river ferry traffic.  I believe that once cross river traffic begins the land will restricted to all except those going into the United States via the ferry.    Please note that we do not restrict fishing on any other property in the town.    If you have any other questions please feel free to contact us.

But I still disagree that any municipality can enact such fees to out of towners. Don't forget the fact that you have a tourist based economy in Niagara and this does not go over very well with us ""outsiders.""  I have never shorefished from any location in NOTL, I am only speaking for those that do. I can understand your concerns with noise and trash, but this is probably no more of a problem than what you experience in the rest of your community. Don't forget that fishermen and women do spend tourist dollars also.  Truly,"
