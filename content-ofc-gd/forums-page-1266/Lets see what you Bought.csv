36447,PatrickGG,2007-02-19 18:11:00,562,Heres my pickings from the show this weekend.  
36584,fish4me,2007-02-19 23:57:00,59,"Bought a 2 piece med hvy 7 ft st croix musky rod and a glow in the dark thunderstick.  One thing I dlearned is that once company's actions is not the same as another.  This rod was stiffer and rated for heavier line and weight than a heavy action shimano rod of similar specs, very intersting.  They felt very different also, the st croix was much nicer.  Got 2 free hats and a key chain also"
36633,Victor,2007-02-20 01:25:00,1609,- 2 hats from fishing world (me and my dad) - Shimano Baitrunner 4500B (no tax)
