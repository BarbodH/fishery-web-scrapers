36974,misfish,2007-02-20 19:20:00,29133,Under powered? what hp size is it ?  The two I have owned were used.An 80 will fly.
36983,zman,2007-02-20 19:36:00,179,The one the person is selling is a 80 and I only have a 55lb on a 16.5 princecraft pro It came with the boat and I want to upgrade
37001,just2manylures,2007-02-20 20:01:00,144,I would see if you can get it checked out first by a repair centre.  I bought a used transom mount a few years back and had the service centre in Midland take a peek at it.  They said she was all good so I ended up buying it off the fellow  my 2 cents  2many
37018,Big Cliff,2007-02-20 20:20:00,6899,"I think a lot of it depends on who you are buying it from. I sold a Minn-Kota bow mount a few years ago. When I sold it I believed it was in perfect working order. It turned out there was a problem with it so I took it back and had it repaired at my expense. I didn't make as much on it as I would have liked but I was happy that I never had to be ashamed to face the person that bought it from me. My word is worth a lot more than money to me, unfortunatly not everyone is like that. Just be careful!"
