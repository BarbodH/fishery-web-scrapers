37115,Daplumma,2007-02-20 23:19:00,1961,I have wondered this for a while. Joe
37118,mason05,2007-02-20 23:25:00,258,I'm no expert but I think it has something to do with the angle of the fishing line and how it appears to change its direction when submerged in the water???  Perhaps it's also a reference to the angle one holds a fishing rod while fishing???  Great question!  Hopefully someone has the correct answer around here cause I've often wondered that myslef.

37162,fishindevil,2007-02-20 23:59:00,6254,": It's because the angler angles. To angle, meaning to fish, comes from a Middle English noun ""angel"" (pronounced to rhyme with dangle), which simply means a fish-hook.  Check out an ancient (1600s) book by Julianne Burners titled ""The Art of Fishing wiht an Angle"" and you will find the angle actually refers to the angle between the pole and the line. This is an important aspect of fishing with ancient equipment. Modern poles and drag reels make it somewhat less crucial.  well this seems to be the answer....went to www.ask.com"

Now you'll have to ask where the origin of the word ""angle"" is!""  setomonkey has got it right. Back when the term was coined rudimentary fishing hooks were bent at a 45 degree angle and resembled the leter ""V"" thus, fish hooks were known as angles and fishermen as anglers. And on a somewhat unrelated note the term ""splitshot"", which was coined around the same time, was derived from the action of navle offisers using a knife to cut a notch in lead musket round inorder to use it to weight their lines."

37295,Rich Clemens,2007-02-21 02:56:00,3131,I think it is because we take so many angles just trying to catch a fish ... thus angle + r

37442,just2manylures,2007-02-21 13:17:00,144,"Angling is a term that has been used for many years now.  I think the term ""angler"" comes from the far east where the fishermen in the early 1500s (or so) were of the Anglitians tribe.  They would spend their days on the water fishing to feed the tribe.  These were some of the first people to use a rod rather than nets so that separated them from the fishermen who used nets.  Thus the term ""angler"" was born.
