37247,fishersquige,2007-02-21 01:31:00,52,Awesome day on hard water today. It was nice to be out in warmer than usual weather. Fished on 100 feet of water. We caught 9 in total between the 2 of us but most were small. Still managed 3 keepers for dinner(2 for my buddy and 1 for me). Smallest fish being 3 lbs and the biggest 7 lbs. Unfortunately I forgot to take a pic while I was out there but here is one already filleted and ready for the frying pan.  Hopefully I can make it out to the Fishing For Tyler Get Together so that I can meet some OFNers and get Roger (BPSbassman) fishing on hard water lol.

37501,irishfield,2007-02-21 16:14:00,26272,Yah sure Tony...that's what you told me last year!  SO Fishersquige.....how was the meal ? ?
37520,fishersquige,2007-02-21 16:34:00,52,"It was great.  Just season with salt and pepper and dip in flour, fry up in oil and butter and squeeze some lemon over top.  Simple as that... the smaller ones are better eating than the bigger ones."
