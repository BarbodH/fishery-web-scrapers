36629,charlied,2007-02-20 01:18:00,584,do you skin splake or leave the skin on when cooking...?
36631,Spiel,2007-02-20 01:22:00,9065,"....For me it would depend on how big they are. If they are pan fryers by all means skin on, golden brown an delicious. But once they start to get over a couple of pounds I prefer them fileted and skinned, same for any trout actually."
36634,tjsa,2007-02-20 01:27:00,1578,"Or, if they are of decent size, but not too big(that would probably be over 3 lbs. for me), leave the skin on, stuff em with whatever you like, rice, stove top,  uncle bens, etc. coat them in margarine or butter, wrap in foil, and bake 'em."
36635,charlied,2007-02-20 01:27:00,584,"they are about 1 pound I would say....I don't know how to Filet without tearing them apart, so I was just wondering if it is possible to eat them with the skin on."
36637,Mike the Pike,2007-02-20 01:29:00,3421,Charlie what is a splake?
36638,Fisherman,2007-02-20 01:31:00,7201,"It's a laketrout/speckle cross, usually incapable of reproducing."
36641,charlied,2007-02-20 01:34:00,584,really didn't know they couldn't reproduce...interesting....ministry stocks them so people can fish them and stay away from naturally reproducing lakers and speckies....well from what I know.  But man do they hit hard and can fight pretty good...scrappy fish.
36643,Fisherman,2007-02-20 01:39:00,7201,I knew I read it somewhere:  http://www.ontarioanglerawards.com/Downloa...eets/Splake.pdf
36647,troutologist,2007-02-20 01:45:00,951,"Even if you leave the skin on, after its cooked it will literally fall off. Id only worry about removing skin on a large fish to prevent eating the fat just under it. This can hold a high level of contaminents"
36649,charlied,2007-02-20 01:47:00,584,thanks trout....but do you think that it would have alot of contaminents in a lake like that that I think is spring fed.....would be interesting to find out if it does.
36651,charlied,2007-02-20 01:50:00,584, Great read...thanks!
36677,troutologist,2007-02-20 02:42:00,951,  Depends on a pile of factors the sportfish eating guide is a good start to find out if the lake is polluted. anything around 1lb generally hasnt been alive long enough to accumlate a great deal pollutants.
37366,John Bacon,2007-02-21 04:23:00,3277," That would depend on a number of factors; one being whether you were correct about it being spring fed  If the lake is near farms, the fish may contain organic contaminents from pesticides, these tend to build up in the fatty tissue.  In this case, removing the skin along with is a wise precausion; although I wouldn't be too concerned about small fish.  If the lake is in more of a wilderness setting, then mercury would be more of a concern.  Mercury contamination is actually a bigger problem in remote northern lakes than in areas such as the Kawarthas.  Unfortunately, mercury is contained in the flesh of the fish so removing the skin and belly fat isn't going to help much."
37371,carll2,2007-02-21 04:30:00,443,"  mike in quebec i believe its called ""moulac"" but they are quite rare around here"
37518,CLofchik,2007-02-21 16:34:00,854,"  Try this stuffing, in a pot on medium low heat mix up enough cubed bread with butter and orange zest, toss in whatever spices you like.  Use enough butter to moisten all the bread cubes and enough orange zest (lemon/lime works too) so you can smell it without bending over the pot.  Let it cool for a few minutes and stuff the citrus butter bread cubes into the trout and bake at 350 until it's done.  The fish will have a faint citrus flavour to it, all through the meat.  Tastes incredible, I've even got my Italian in-laws eating salmon from Lake Ontario.   Bread cut up in cubes, zest from an orange or 1 lemon & 1 lime, and enough butter to moisten everything up.  Stuff into whatever salmon or trout you have.  Simple quick and tastes great."
