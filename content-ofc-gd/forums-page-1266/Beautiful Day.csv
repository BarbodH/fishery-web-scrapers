37674,Headhunter,2007-02-21 20:45:00,5703,"I've have a friend of mine who has the 5 peice rod/reel and case, he uses it for his fly in trips every spring. He really likes the combo, but has suggested that you keep a very close eye on the rod segments. They can come apart and fly off into the water. I think if you kept an eye on them, you should be fine. HH"
