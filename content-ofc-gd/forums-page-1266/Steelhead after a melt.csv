36451,Josh Rogers,2007-02-19 18:20:00,79,Hey everyone. This will be my second spring fishing for steelies in the tribs. I just had a question for the steelhead experts out there. How long do you wait to hit the tribs after a melt? The old ice fishing just isn't cutting it for me and I can't wait to get into some steel. Any info would be appreciated. Thanks all  ATF
36457,tonyb,2007-02-19 18:40:00,1637,"Try the rivermouths now! and all throughout the winter, good fishing can be had, especially during mild spells (i.e. later this week)  Cheers, Tony"
36470,The Urban Fisherman,2007-02-19 19:07:00,2050,"hey dude,  I'm going to try the mouth of the credit later this week - i'll let you know how it goes!  UF"
36478,Pigeontroller,2007-02-19 19:28:00,2793,The only issue is visibility...It can be muddy after a melt.
36497,kemper,2007-02-19 20:47:00,2232,As soon as some fishable water is open Im in the tribs (below the tracks of course).  I stand on the ice for weeks fishin open water before it all thaws
36537,canadian_copper,2007-02-19 22:00:00,925,"melt is a dangerous time of yr!!! waters can rise fast and gettin hit by a chunk of ice aint fun either  lol it all comes down to vis like pigeon said!!! if ya can see your roe sac fall atleast 4""under the water then your good to go!!!"
36545,snag,2007-02-19 22:27:00,1932, YOU CHOSE AN URGENT MESSAGE TO USE ALL LOWER-CASE LETTERS!  IT'S LIKE WE DON'T EVEN KNOW YOU!
36558,kemper,2007-02-19 22:54:00,2232,"snag, that avatar is possibly the ugliest thing I have ever laid eyes on."
36706,Master of Bait,2007-02-20 03:27:00,196,"Kemper - I'm with you on that one.  Snag, you picked something truly special...  It's inspired me to look for a new one myself..."
36717,snag,2007-02-20 03:45:00,1932,"Kemper, M.O.B  Let's not hijack the thread,  You guys are mean,  That's my drivers licence picture (taken the morning after St.Patricks day)  Actually M.O.B our avatars look related.    In the spirit of the thread, I might try to hit the credit soon.  Hope I can do 1/8th as well as CANADIAN COPPER."
36722,DMASSE,2007-02-20 03:54:00,420,"As long as the water levels are good and the visibility is ok i would try now,  i know there is some open water on some of the eastern tribes that never freeze and the fishing is usually good..  explore and find different areas to fish..  DAVE"
36839,Josh Rogers,2007-02-20 14:18:00,79,Thanks Fellas. Anybody know if the Ganny has opened up yet?
36849,tonyb,2007-02-20 14:28:00,1637,Try at the riverMOUTH LOL  It's rather dangerous as C.C. mentioned with ice floes drifting down stream as she melts.  Tony
36960,Josh Rogers,2007-02-20 18:53:00,79,Thanks guys might give her a go on the weekend. I'll post how I made out and the conditions and whatnot.
36973,snag,2007-02-20 19:20:00,1932,"Just an update,  I just had lunch with some folks who said they have been having luck at the river mouths in the GTA.  I didn't get a chance to ask what they caught or what they were using (spoons were mentioned).  They expected water visibility to improve over the next 2 days.  Good luck"
37031,kemper,2007-02-20 20:49:00,2232,With this warm weather and some rain in the forcast it shouldnt be too long before the tribs start to soften up.  Watch out for really high water levels and changes in the river that you arent used to (if wading an area you think you know well)
