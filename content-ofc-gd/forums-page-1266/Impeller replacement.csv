36701,Mike the Pike,2007-02-20 03:16:00,3421,Hey Pigeon I just replaced the impeller kit on my kicker motor an 8hp 2 stroke Yamaha.Get this one you order an impeller kit but it does not come with the impeller .Yamaha charges you extra for the impeller.What a rip off.After buying the kit for $99.00 I had to purchase the impeller for another $25. I am not impressed with Yamaha.My dealer was not happy about it and has complained to Yamaha in Japan.It seems this is the new way they sell the kit.  Thats my beef with Yamaha
36738,John Bacon,2007-02-20 04:18:00,3277,So what do you get in the kit?  Isn't it only the impellor that needs to be replaced on a regular basis?
