36621,Mike the Pike,2007-02-20 01:10:00,3421,"Kevin I have owned a  55hp Suzuki outboard in the past although they are Ok I would not purchase one again.I had to replace the block and a cylinder not pleased about that .When you need parts they are usually back order from Japan.I broke a propshaft one summer and it took the whole month of July for it to arrive from Japan  .I now own a Honda which my dealer informs me that I can get parts quickly.Much faster than Suzuki.There not bad motors just they have a back order problem.Nice thing about Mercury,Johnson and Evinrude is there are many dealers available for parts.Thats my seven cents. and one american toonie.Good luck.Mike "
36623,BFSC Kevin,2007-02-20 01:14:00,1351,"in regards to clampet, i've done that search already, not much info there. and to mike, thats what i was concerned about, doesn't seem like it that easy/cheap to get the parts for them, even though my current motor is 30 years old, its very easy to find manuals and parts still."
36756,Sinker,2007-02-20 07:39:00,8692,"I had a 25 suzuki tiller.....great engine.....never a problem with it. In fact, I sold it to a buddy and he is still using it now. I think it was an '89. Never had a problem with getting parts, cause I never needed any....  SInker"
36757,mikemcmillan,2007-02-20 07:43:00,50,"I have a 2000 55hp 3 cylinder, runs great, easy on fuel and is very reliable. I havn't had any problems so the parts issue hasn't affected me, but having to wait a month in the middle of the season would be a huge downer."
36774,Big Cliff,2007-02-20 11:11:00,6899,"I didn't reply earlier because I don't know anything about the smaller motors but I have a 1986 55hp oil injected suzuki and it runs like a dream, I have never had to do anything to it other than regular maint. so I can't really tell you much about that. If I was going to buy a new motor tomorrow though I would probably go with a Honda 4 stroke. Not because I have anything against the Suzuki, I just like what I see in the Honda."
36776,Greencoachdog,2007-02-20 11:33:00,8163,"  ... and whick toonie would that be? The Suzie B., the Sacky Gold, or the Presi?"
36926,Bernie,2007-02-20 17:15:00,3190,I think if I were to buy a used outboard it would be one with a close by dealer for parts and service. I believe all brands can have a possible part backorder from time to time. The more common the outboard chances are better of finding the right part. They ALL will have possible problems.
37362,John Bacon,2007-02-21 04:07:00,3277,"I also have a 55hp oil injected Suzuki ... it seems to be a popular choice on this board.  It is a 1993, and still runs very well.  It did have to spend over $50 dollars to replace the cap for the oil tank; so there is a concern about the cost of parts.     Luckily, I haven't had to replace many parts on it.  I can't help you on the price of a used motor.  But I do think they have a good product."
