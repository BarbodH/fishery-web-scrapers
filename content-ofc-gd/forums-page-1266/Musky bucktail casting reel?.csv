35627,danbo,2007-02-17 08:13:00,2646,Anybody use the ABU RECORD reel?  review link here
35637,danbo,2007-02-17 11:04:00,2646,Hmmmmmm..looks like I better pony-up for a Luna or Calcutta instead! Thanx WFN!
35638,ChrisK,2007-02-17 11:26:00,2772,"Danbo, I don't personally have a Record but I do have a couple of ABU's  kickin around,6500 and a 7000...From what I can see from the reveiw link the Record has the clicker button on the top left side of the reel and I have a problem with that. My 6500 clicker is in the same position and I find I end up engaging the clicker when casting,not always but when it happens it doesn't sound like its doing alot of good for the reel....On my 7000 the clicker is on the side of the reel and out of the way which makes it alot more user freindly for myself ....."
35641,lew,2007-02-17 11:47:00,12767,"Never used one myself Dan, but I remember reading one of the American musky boards a year or so back, where some members were discussing the Record, and nobody that had one, was too impressed with them.  Seemed like they lost their smoothness very quickly.  If you buy a Calcutta, you'll be more than happy.....guaranteed !!"
35649,danbo,2007-02-17 12:38:00,2646,Thanks fellas!
35661,bigbuck,2007-02-17 13:22:00,2449,"Take a look at the new Okuma Induron, I saw it yesterday at the show and was impressed. You can buy 2 of them for the price of a Calcutta."
35675,danbo,2007-02-17 14:32:00,2646,Thanks again. I've been using my old Daiwa TD-1 Hi for years now but figure I'm due for an upgrade. So many choices..so little money! Lol.
35679,lew,2007-02-17 14:47:00,12767,"Hey Dan, if your lookin for a nice musky reel at at good price, have a look at the Maina reel sold at BPS.  I've used one on my boo-tail rod for 2 years now and am very happy with it.  It comes in 2 different speeds...4.1-1 or 5.1-1 but only in right hand crank.  You could even buy the rod / reel combo which is good. I bought my daughter one last year and it's  an excellent setup and only about $200 total."
35692,mikeh,2007-02-17 15:29:00,824,"I have the Quantum Cabo PT cbc31pts that I use for musky, it has a low profile and is very smooth and won't break the bank. One booth at the show had them for $219  taxes included. It also comes in a left hand model."
35693,Pigeontroller,2007-02-17 15:32:00,2793,"And if you have the cash...The Calcutta TE's are very nice. About $530 CDN, or $350 USD. Expensive but very nice!  No, I don't have one. Yet."
35700,muskiebobsr,2007-02-17 16:35:00,49,"I don't know I have been using Garcias since they came out and have never had a major problem with one of them.  I wore a Calcutta out in one season, so go figure.  I'm going to try a Record this year.  I have a Garcia Morum that I really like better for feel than I did the Calcutta.  I think it depends on the person using it.  I have over the years used most brands and I still go back to Abu's  My $2 dollars and 2 cents worth.  LOL."
35704,douG,2007-02-17 16:42:00,2693,"I've got one, Danbo.  I've used it a half dozen times, still like it."
35714,GbayGiant,2007-02-17 18:04:00,1780,"  I used a Induron 400 last year for the whole season, it gave me no problems, but it doesn't seem to well built, lots of plastic pieces, my abus feel better for around the same price, only time will tell, I will see how long it lasts."
35716,danbo,2007-02-17 18:15:00,2646,"Great info guys, I'm gonna work on that nice Daiwa!"
35897,Raf,2007-02-18 05:25:00,3495,6500s virtually unchanged for years.. because htey work.
35952,danbo,2007-02-18 14:23:00,2646,Dang it RAF..now ya got me thinkin about ABU again!  Check this one..  abu 6600 c4  link
37037,danbo,2007-02-20 21:03:00,2646,I bought a near new Shimano Corvalus 400 loaded with #40 Power Pro. I'm all set now! Thanks Weeds..
37257,bucktail,2007-02-21 01:47:00,1857,Try looking at the NEW Curado with extra line capacity. Low profile ( easy on the hands ) and 7 to 1 retreive ratio for bulging those bucktails!
37459,Kanatian,2007-02-21 14:08:00,3,"One of the Abu Garcia 6500s that has been around for a number of years but seems to get little notice is the Trophy series.  They have the bearing set of a C4 but the gearing of a C3.  I have used one for the past two years exclusively for bucktails and love it.  Much smoother than a C3 and they come with a power handle.  If you look around, there are deals.  Bill"
