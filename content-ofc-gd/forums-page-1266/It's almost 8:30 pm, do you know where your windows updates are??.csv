36640,tjsa,2007-02-20 01:33:00,1578,"I am guilty of not doing this as much as the rest, but at work today, I did all the updates on half of our laptops, and a couple of our work machines, and you have to do the windows updates at least twice, they don't give you all the updates at once. A couple of the laptops took 3 times to get all the updates and security stuff done. Then, I ran spybot, ad-aware, disk defragmenter(even if it was not absolutely required), then chkdsk(in the command prompt).  Did my home machine tonight, which is why I am here so late, lol."
36646,dsn,2007-02-20 01:44:00,1018,Yeah I do all that basically every other day. Just to be on the safe side.  dsn
36648,motv8tr,2007-02-20 01:46:00,2587,huh....don't know the last time I updated windows.....  Maureen
36664,kemper,2007-02-20 02:24:00,2232,"I dont click on ANYTHING that pops up on my screen, whether it says WINDOWS update or not. Last time I clicked on a windows update it caused major problems. I leave the computer updates to the momma bear."
36669,GbayGiant,2007-02-20 02:30:00,1780,"Mine automatically updates windows, as well as checks spy ware once a day and makes the computer run much smoother, but I updated the AVG free today with no problems."
36671,dsn,2007-02-20 02:31:00,1018,I pick and chose my updates. I don't need all the junk they recommend. That includes explorer 7.
36711,Raf,2007-02-20 03:34:00,3495,IE 7 is a big improvement over IE 6.  Unless you use firefox or another browser going to IE7 is a worthwhile upgrade.
36715,bigfish1965,2007-02-20 03:39:00,3382,I did the last batch of upgrades the other day and my PC is running like crap since.
36716,irishfield,2007-02-20 03:40:00,26272,"Like Raf says! Was a tad of a shock when everything looked different...but I like it much better than 6 for sure. My computer is always (auto) looking for updates and all I have to do is click okay at a time I'm not browsing on my sub speed dial up of 22,600 !  One thing I found is it does have more Phishing filter..so you may have to do some adjusting to get to places you use to go..."
36750,Joey,2007-02-20 05:00:00,9122,There are updates
36754,The Urban Fisherman,2007-02-20 05:40:00,2050,"I just click ""UPDATE"" whenever OSX prompts me! hehehe  Ever since I switched from PC to MAC I've been doing less of this    and more of this  But hey, some people use braid and some use floro....to each his own....   UF"
36768,dsn,2007-02-20 10:44:00,1018,I don't like phishing filters or all kinda of tool bars. It just clogges up my veiw takes up more memory. Then I'll have to buy a new computer who wants all that?  I like things to be simple. That's one reason why I didn't upgrade to IE7. Nor will I upgarde to Microcsoft Vista. Thats a killer too. needs something like 1G to run the thing and 15G's to install.  What am I Rich?   dsn
