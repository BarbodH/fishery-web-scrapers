36761,lew,2007-02-20 08:36:00,12767,"I let the pooch out at 3:15 and it almost felt like a summertime breeze with a temperature of + 4  First time it's been above freezing for quite awhile, but I'll take it"
36762,Clampet,2007-02-20 08:37:00,1947,A welcome break. We are fortunate to be able to have warm climes compared to some of our US neighbours.
36766,OhioFisherman,2007-02-20 10:19:00,6623,"42 f here with the morning news, LOL melt down!"
36772,misfish,2007-02-20 11:04:00,29133,Lew I was about to go back in the house this morning and put shorts and a T on. Man what a rise in temps.Ah this is nice.
36775,Rich Clemens,2007-02-20 11:18:00,3131,I also was surprised when I let the dogs out a little while ago.  Nice warm-up over night.  Maybe some of the hard-packed snow and ice will melt off our streets.
36777,misfish,2007-02-20 11:33:00,29133, You have snow down there in the south.LOL
36781,motv8tr,2007-02-20 11:49:00,2587,"Plus one up here even, and no rain or nothing....is spring coming or something??? I guess my mom's coming for a visit  Maureen"
36782,pikehunter,2007-02-20 12:00:00,1659,"Woke up at around 5:30 this morning and could here drip..drip..drip..drip. The leaky trough(gutter) dripping on the aluminum awning over the bedroom window.  So I got up, turned on the tube and flicked through the channels. Found the weather on a Buffalo channel, it was 38 degrees there and 39 in Hamilton. Spring is here?"
36783,silveradosheriff,2007-02-20 12:11:00,1025,Bring on the softwater!
36787,Clampet,2007-02-20 12:30:00,1947,"Now, now.. don't let this fool you. Every year it is the same thing. There is still some cold yet to come. Hate to put a damper on the warm spell, but that's life."
36789,Basskicker,2007-02-20 12:33:00,421,Winter is definately not over....but a couple days like this...I'll take it...wow it just feels SOOOO nice...  Jason
36791,lew,2007-02-20 12:38:00,12767,"I think were ALL aware that there will probably be more cold weather to come, but the warm temperatures forecast for the next few days are just a nice break from the cold weather we've all endured for the last month."
36792,ccmtcanada,2007-02-20 12:39:00,7971,"YEH!!  Woke up, went to the car....breathed in that nice mild air....ahhh....it's nice not to have my facial hair freeze when I breathe....LOL."
36793,Cast-Away,2007-02-20 12:41:00,790,"Hey Lew, you slept in today (3:15)! I had to strategically walk my dog today in order to minimize mud coverage on her undercarriage!"
36796,Guest mistyriver1,2007-02-20 12:44:00,0,"Morning Lew, the walk with Marv today will be a little warmer for sure."
36797,lew,2007-02-20 12:49:00,12767," Nope, I was up and at it by 2:30, it was Marvin who slept in till 3:15  Boy, that mutt sure is gettin lazy in his old age  And your right Jim, he never even wore his coat this morning."
36799,John,2007-02-20 12:51:00,2956,Morning all....  First above freezing day we have had in more than a month. Certainly is welcome.
36817,OhioFisherman,2007-02-20 13:46:00,6623,"To quick a spring thaw hurts the walleye spawn here, muddies up the spawning grounds and the silt can hurt the eggs( Bury them)"
36984,yzer93,2007-02-20 19:37:00,7,it's giving me the itch for some spring fishing already......
36987,pooch,2007-02-20 19:41:00,139,"3 weeks of winter, I'll take that!"
36989,pooch,2007-02-20 19:42:00,139,"3 weeks of winter, I'll take that!"
