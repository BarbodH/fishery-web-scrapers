Great hunters use words like respect and pride in the hunt, and great trappers take pride in what they do. This is some burn out, riding around with a gun shootin at stuff. I wonder if kids were playin in the road would he humor the thought of takin a shot at them? Probably. Look, this guy was just drivin around lookin for somethin to shoot. Real Hunters dont do that stuff. Just my opinion and thoughts about the subject."

411839,POLLIWOGG,2009-12-14 17:04:00,835,Its against the law to keep a pet deer from the wild. I know a guy that had one and the MNR made him release it or they would take it.
411861,Dara,2009-12-14 18:23:00,3052,  They should be charged too. Endangering wildlife.
411877,cram,2009-12-14 19:47:00,1733," Pretty sure they weren't keeping it in a cage or anything.  It wasn't ""kept"" as a pet...."

412053,Dara,2009-12-15 03:13:00,3052,This story made our paper today...what a bunch of bull
412073,ADB,2009-12-15 04:14:00,444,"  Yeah, we wouldn't want the poor ""hunter"" to be embarrased publically...  From the facts that are allegedly known: the ""hunter"" shot the deer illegally AND left the body, also an offense.  The family nursed the deer to health from when it was young and gave it every chance to take to the wild...even turning down a neighbour's request to lock the deer in their barn during the hunting season.  They never kept the deer against it's will...heck, if it wasn't for them, it wouldn't be alive.  And if they ever attempted to abandon it somewhere, it probably wouldn't survive considering it's level of human socialization.  I don't see what the arguement is about...the hunter took the deer illegally, a deer that was raised by a family, on their own dime most likely.  I could understand if they were trying to sue the ""hunter"" for killing their ""pet"", but I haven't read anything to that affect.  They seem to be quite understanding in terms of the fact that they knew what happened could indeed happen one day.  Throw the book at him..."
412173,Dara,2009-12-15 16:22:00,3052,"Sure the poacher was illegal. Put him in jail. But why do all the papers have to use it as a heart throb filler piece. How bout something about a waste of tax dollars rather than trying to make hunters look like wicked people. As said before, it wasn't a hunter, it was a poacher."
412175,Guest gbfisher,2009-12-15 16:31:00,0,"If it wasn't a 'pet' it was food!! If it was shot legally, so be it.  If it was poached....fine the idiot."
412184,bigfish1965,2009-12-15 17:10:00,3382," Why would you expect it to not be that type of story? How is pursuing a poacher a waste of tax dollars? I do not see how this makes hunters look bad. This was a drive-by shooting. If the entire hunting community condemns the actions of this person, it does not have an adverse effect on ethical sportsmen. The deer was at risk of being shot by a REAL hunter and no one seems to dispute that. The collars were just a hope that it would deter a real hunter. It may have worked..you would not expect to see that. But this person is in clear violation of at least a few laws and as someone who believes in safe hunting and ethical use of resources, I hope they make a giant example out of him. The Bambi effect actually helps in this case. P3TA can't make an example of this since this person does not deserve the title of hunter. He is a poacher and needs to be dealt with. Yes, the people involved with the deer increased its risk by being involved, however from the story info it was a compassionate move on their part. I doubt many of us would do differently. Lots of hunters have found orphaned or abandoned off spring and have done the same thing. Remember that video of the moose hunters with the calf and how they tried and tried to get the thing to go away??"
412188,tightline,2009-12-15 17:27:00,322,"Seems most of you have missed the word ""alleged"" poacher...none of what the boy has said has been proven only that the deer is dead...Pretty quick to hang one of our own...how many of you would claim a deer with two hounds gaurding it, and do you all really think this guy drove up to the house with a muzzleloader and shot it in the front yard like I mentioned previously...especially in sight of a 14 year old boy who was close enough to get a plate number...sounds like a kid who just found his pet killed and wants a little revenge...guess will see in the end...hope I never have the need to find any of you on a jury!"
412192,bigfish1965,2009-12-15 17:44:00,3382, Everyone is going with the facts available. You are introducing speculation. Only time will tell.
412195,tightline,2009-12-15 17:55:00,322,"This man has not even been charged and is only ""under investigation"" just saying most of you have him pinned allready...like I mentioned Rick would you claim a deer being gaurded by 2 deer hounds...I'd have to guess most of us wouldn't...Sure lots of people loved the deer and thats what is really bring out the headlines...but for once I agree with gbfisher a deer is food and not a pet...the real story is how the misguided kindness of a family put this deers life in danger far more times then I'm sure it would have been had it been left to the wild...this story says there were ""shots"" fired so if this guy was poaching in front of the house with his muzzle loader he took the time to reload and take another shot at it??? Doesn't sound like a very logical thing to do in mid crime?????  Just seems to be more to the story then this kid is saying...it also states in the Toront Sun report that the guy stuck around and said to the family ""I just killed Rudolph""??????? so tell me how that is fleeing the scene....This ""story"" stinks more and more every time I read it!!  http://www.northumberlandtoday.com/Article....aspx?e=2209965"
412211,Dara,2009-12-15 19:02:00,3052,"  Thats just it, there are NO facts available.   Remember the story on my hunt camp?  The guy reported that there were 4 bedrooms. He was in the camp for a tour and in fact saw 8 bedrooms. All he would have to do is think for half a second even if his notes were wrong. How can we believe anything reported nowadays.  As far as it making hunters look bad, of course it does...not to hunters, but to non hunters.  Reporters should be taken to task for some of the crap they write."
412213,bigfish1965,2009-12-15 19:06:00,3382,"In order to be a poacher you have to be somewhat of an idiot to begin with so any actions would not be surprising. I cannot imagine a scenario where I would take down a deer and two domestic dogs would be nearby.... and domestic dogs would hardly guard the deer. They would have a curiosity, but guard it?? Not even coyotes would likely make more than a bluff espcially after the blast of a muzzle loader. What makes more sense given the info available?"
412220,tightline,2009-12-15 19:25:00,322,"It states in the story the dogs went everywhere with the deer...and being 2 dogs used for hunting by the family I hardly think they would run at the shot of a gun...if there were shots and the guy shot the deer in a legal scenario he has all the right to track and take that animal...hence the ""shots"" I never said he wasn't a poacher I just said alot of things in this story don't make sense and most of you have allready past sentence on the guy...now whos speculating???"
412236,bigfish1965,2009-12-15 20:01:00,3382,"The story says the dog was NOT guarding the deer and had in fact come running home. The shot was heard by the homeowner making it fairly close to the house. The car was reported as speeding away. So, using what is reported... what conclusion can would come to? The report of what the poacher said is Hearsay, so I ignored that. It is not possible to know if there is a firearms discharge violation given the generalities in the location. As far as the owners kid being the first to be on the scene, that follows with what is reported since it was reported to happen close to the house.  If I heard a gunshot I would be outside looking...or under the table if the shot accompanied broken glass"
412246,Dara,2009-12-15 20:40:00,3052,Its north of 7...anything goes
412248,ch312,2009-12-15 21:02:00,1590,"id agree that this article doesnt contain all of the facts like most articles of this nature. they will always twist it any way possible to make the story sound more interesting. its a simple marketing tactic.  the more believable story would be this guy was cruising country roads looking for deer to shoot. he happened to see this doe somewhere while cruising by and he stopped to shoot it. he likely missed the first shot which is why there were multiple shots. this domesticated deer likely didnt run from the gunshots. then the deer ran back towards the house i would assume. even a deer hit in the vitals can run 80-100 yards. the guy likely booked it when the son started flipping out after going to investigate the shots or seeing the deer.  this is something most hunters in ontario are against and is illegal if you dont have permission for the property where you finally see a deer. these types are typically poachers and id like to see them punished. i believe there is also something that says you cant shoot within 500m of a dwelling.  im not defending the actions, just trying to give some insight on what is more believable than the newspaper...   the sound from a gun shot can easily travel kilometers, especially in open terrain and when it is cold out."

411515,Big Cliff,2009-12-13 14:31:00,6899,"I read it in the Toronto Sun this morning, I hope they throw the book at him! Shooting from the road; maybe he couldn't see the two orange collars on the deer but you have to wonder. Some people just have to kill things! I think it is very sad that when a wild animal becomes tame and looses it's fear of humans and it gets killed because of it.  We feed ducks here every year, we have two that have returned for the last three years now, we've even named them Quackers, and Cheese. Every year they have their young and they get so tame that they will come and take food right out of my hand, I can usually pick the ducklings up and hold them without mom or dad getting too upset about it. I am realistic enough to understand that come fall they will be fair game, as long as it is done within the law!"
411518,Terry,2009-12-13 14:35:00,14456,"I don't really know all the details, but I don't know if I would notice a collar on it's neck making it a pet I know I get excited when about to shoot an animal and ask myself that is a deer not a person or dog or cow and if yes, do I have a clear, safe shot, if yes pull trigger , now I have to ask is it a family pet...I don't think so..  if everything else about the kill was legal, I could be that guy   edit:  OK if he shot from the road, he should go down"
411519,Daplumma,2009-12-13 14:38:00,1961,Dude is no more a hunter than a snagger is a fisherman.Its called poaching..not hunting or fishing. Joe
411520,Gerritt,2009-12-13 14:38:00,6129,not to mention killing the deer and not retrieving it.....   seems this guy is up poops creek without a paddle..  G.
411523,Beans,2009-12-13 14:45:00,3339,Too bad it wasn't wearing an orange blaze horse blanket...a collar could be missed...
411534,Dara,2009-12-13 15:11:00,3052,"They burried the deer?  Doesn't the MNR usually donate to the soup kitchen or something?..Seems a waste to me.  I was wonderin about where it was. Its legal to shoot from the road up here...I guess not there, and the guy shouldn't have left it behind. I don't agree with domesticating a wild animal though...gotta be a law against that."
411537,cram,2009-12-13 15:31:00,1733, Pretty hard to donate a family pet to the soup kitchen.
411545,trapshooter,2009-12-13 15:51:00,1234, You make it sound like you can stand ON the road and shoot.... not true... you have to step off of the 'maintained' section of the road.  Even the gravel shoulder is considered maintained.
411553,Fishnwire,2009-12-13 16:12:00,983,That's just sad for everyone involved.
411555,cisco,2009-12-13 16:15:00,597,My understnding is that on Kings and on secondary highways and now even on any year-round maintained gravel road you must be on the other side of the fence (or where it would be separating roadland and adjacent land) along the road. But IMO the 'pet'  owners are who really screwed up. They should have put it in the barn as their neighbour offered. Nothing good can come out of a pet that is fair game during hunting season. Orange collars saying 'Don't shoot me' on a deer. Seems the only way to read the collar is by shooting the deer. Silly people who have placed the bait and now as hunters themselves should be ashamed the public has another bad example of 'hunters' to use against us. The media uses the word 'hunter' not 'poacher'. Hunters now have to pay for the foolishness of both the hunter and the 'pet' owners.
411557,gaspumper,2009-12-13 16:17:00,393,"It wasnt reported,but they shot it out of the vehicle window,the deer was standing in the front yard of the house along with the pet dogs.This deer was so tame it would go in the house and lay on the floor or chesterfield alongside the kids and dogs.They lived in the Cooper area north of Madoc."
411558,Musky or Specks,2009-12-13 16:19:00,2710,If the hunter hadnt shot the deer from the road Id have no problem with it. But he did and therefore hes a poacher and should be prosecuted.
411559,Big Cliff,2009-12-13 16:21:00,6899," The deer was brought to them as a baby fawn, they helped it survive, apart from that they let nature take it's course (read the story)with the exception that during hunting season they put two orange collars on it hoping that a hunter would respect the fact that this wasn't a ""wild"" deer.  My issue isn't so much that this guy shot it as it is with the fact that he did so illeagily and if he was crass enough to violate the law by shooting from the road, then ignorant enough to leave it, was he stupid enough to have shot it realizing that it wasn't a wild deer and shot it just for the sake of killing something?"
411565,Fishnwire,2009-12-13 16:40:00,983,"  If the deer really was in the front yard and there were dogs near by then the poacher took an awful big chance with others' safety by discharging his weapon in that direction.  Pet deer, wild deer or no deer...anyone would takes a shot in the direction of my dog or my house will have a bigger problem on their hands than a ticket from the MNR. I think most of us feel the same way."
411569,Radnine,2009-12-13 16:46:00,1538,"Gerritt, based on your last two posts (both of which have been reactions to news stories) it would be my advice to turn off the TV and quit buying the paper. Life is too short to let yourself be wound up by people who's job it is to wind you up. Have you seen the Old Mill this season, it's absolutely stunning. After you check it out go to Wiggies for a pint and some local flavour. All the best!! Jim"
411589,hotrod,2009-12-13 18:12:00,103,"Shooting anything from the vehicle is not hunting, it's illegal, unsporting and poaching plain and simple. I hope he gets the book thrown at him because this crap goes on all the time, not just with tame deer.  This story will get tons of press and makes all hunters look like asses. They should publish the guys name and let the shaming begin. What an idiot."
411613,trapshooter,2009-12-13 19:14:00,1234," That is the case for Southern Ontario.  There are different rules for Northern Ontario - like I said, off the maintained part of the road."
411614,vinnimon,2009-12-13 19:14:00,2593,"Throw the book at them I say.I wonder how many people they would catch poaching,using a mech dear with collars.Those colors and collars are there for a reason.The very last time out hunting I came across a father and very young son hunting.Not seeing them at the time(and no blaze orange on at all)i thought it was a few rabbits running around,playing.Coming closer to me I pointed and thank god I say what I was pointing at.I hope the father learned a leason.The boy was in tears and me,havent been out since.10 yrs....or soThrow the book at them,by all means.We have a few rabbits that frequent my front yard and the neighbours yards.I leave some treats for them at times in the morning.They are our so called pets,and there is no hunting in my area."
411625,timmeh,2009-12-13 19:43:00,609,Was was some first time hunter who didn't have a clue what they were doing? They clearly didn't stick around to get the animal. Probably cause they knew they were doing something wrong.
411640,MuskiesnLakers,2009-12-13 20:40:00,6,"Timmeh, first time hunters would be the ones that should know BEST to not hunt like that...  in order to get a hunting license you need to take the hunter's safety course, which presumably, would outline those kind of things.  Unless, of course, one took the course, and didn't hunt for another 20 years after, and would hence forget.  I have no problem with the deer being shot, if done so in a legal manner (as some have pointed out).  I mean, kids who live on farms befriend lots of animals that end up on the dinner table.  People own dogs and cats, and they don't live forever either.  You want a deer for a pet -- an animal with a legal hunting season -- then you will always risk experiencing that kind of loss.  But hunting is not the ""old wild west,"" and there are rules that must be followed -- for the safety of everyone.  And not retrieving the deer...  I mean, what the heck is that all about?  They obviously knew they were doing something wrong and should be treated accordingly."
411648,Dara,2009-12-13 20:59:00,3052,"  My book says from the ""travelled"" portion of the road. If the road is paved, the shoulder isn't the travelled portion. The shoulder of a gravelled road isn't either.  I don't understand why in southern Ontario you can't shoot from the same spot. As long as you are not shooting across or along, whats it matter if you cross the ditch and go 30 feet into the bush. Heck, half the stuff I shoot, if I did that I would be shooting back towards the road."
