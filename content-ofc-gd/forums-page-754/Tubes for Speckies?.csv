411354,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-12-12 23:11:00,0,"a few years ago the biggest speck of our trip (a 4.5 lber) was caught on a white laker tube. i bet you could get fish on tubes in spring, you just might want to use panfish tubes or soemthing."
411357,Eazy,2009-12-12 23:19:00,260,"I've got some 2.5"" ones, but still think that might be on the large size tho.."
411362,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-12-12 23:42:00,0,not for one like you're holding in your picture!
411365,Eazy,2009-12-12 23:50:00,260,I guess not eh!
411366,misfish,2009-12-12 23:55:00,29133,"Micro tubes.  And yes,they work."
411367,irishfield,2009-12-12 23:56:00,26272,...or a tiny gold buckshot spoon.
411369,Eazy,2009-12-12 23:59:00,260, Do you tip it with anything?
411372,irishfield,2009-12-13 00:02:00,26272, NO.. bare.. hammered it so hard almost lost my rod.    
411373,misfish,2009-12-13 00:04:00,29133,"Thats cause yer was sleep,n Wayne.  The give away is, the bed head look."
411375,Eazy,2009-12-13 00:08:00,260, Nice fish!
411376,camillj,2009-12-13 00:08:00,1988,Holy smokes Wayne I've never seen a knife so small
411377,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-12-13 00:11:00,0,"those buckshots are KILLER for splake, lakers, and walleye as well! i carry those no matter the species i'm ice fishing for! and like irish said, i had a laker last year nearly take the rod out of my hand..."
411385,Eazy,2009-12-13 01:03:00,260," Yup, I've got a pretty good arsenal of those buckshots as well, ranging from the 3/4oz. down to the 1/4oz. one..."
411395,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-12-13 01:33:00,0,"and i don't like tipping them, but if i do, it's the tail of a dace.  i save my dismembered minnows throughout the day to put on jiggin lines once and a while to mix things up."
411410,Eazy,2009-12-13 02:28:00,260,"Next time you catch and fillet a trout, take the belly portion (which is cut off anyways) and slice it into thin strips about an inch long or so, salt it, and use this for tipping your lures!"
411645,ERB,2009-12-13 20:55:00,35,   What size do you use? Thanks
411651,irishfield,2009-12-13 21:09:00,26272,The smallest one they sell.
411718,Eazy,2009-12-14 01:08:00,260, That would be the 1/4 oz.?........smaller than that I think it's called the FORAGE MINNOW.
411720,irishfield,2009-12-14 01:12:00,26272,that might actually be what it is.. the little forage minnow... it's only about an inch long.
411721,Eazy,2009-12-14 01:16:00,260," I just checked on Cabelas, and they make one that is 1/16oz."
