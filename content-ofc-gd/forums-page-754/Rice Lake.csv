411294,irishfield,2009-12-12 19:29:00,26272,"Yep.. a great windfall for local businsses I bet ! Whomever can build them first, advertise well and keep people happy and on fish is gonna be king."
411309,Big Cliff,2009-12-12 20:15:00,6899,I didn't think permanent huts were allowed?
411344,Michael_Brown,2009-12-12 22:25:00,411,Huts are allowed with the same rules as the rest of the province.  Lots of new business oppourtunties that did not exist last year. Great news for our local economy.   Frank at Bridgenorth sports is involved with the winter panfish festival. It should be a great day of fishing with kids. All proceeds are being donated to the United Way.  http://www.clearvieworganizing.com/22.html   Have fun finding a new favorite winter panfish spot.

411808,fishermccann,2009-12-14 15:06:00,655,I hear that Neal Maynard on the north shore close to Bollingbrooke is going to have huts out as well!
411818,Dara,2009-12-14 15:39:00,3052,I think there should be a daily fee to have a hut on the ice. They could hire a bunch more CO's with the money
411820,fishermccann,2009-12-14 15:48:00,655,Someone stop this guy before that thought spreads.
412208,jimmer,2009-12-15 18:31:00,2730,We already pay through our fishing licences!
412253,Flappn,2009-12-15 21:22:00,245,Guys can you tell me when Ice Fishing was opened up to Rice Lake or is it restricted to only the bay/town at Bewdley. Is there a place I could find out more information? ie...MNR or any other Data please.
412265,GBW,2009-12-15 21:56:00,8460,"Yes, the MNR site has posted new zone 17 changes doe 2010.  search for ""zone 17"" here and you will get the linke from one of the many posts."
412299,Fisherman,2009-12-15 23:44:00,7201," Quick, someone find a white truck and a driver, I'll ride shotgun, if we catch him we can hold him for a ransom and....hire a bunch more CO's.   Then again I don't think too many would pay to have him back.."
