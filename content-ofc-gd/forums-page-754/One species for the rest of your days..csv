411121,Weeds,2009-12-12 02:26:00,782,"Hard to choose. Been thinking about it for a couple days and while it's a tough choice I'm thinking Musky. It was either Musky or Largemouth and the more I think about it the less different the pursuit of the 2 species becomes. Ambush predators, big baits (if you choose) short but wild fights. Big difference is that fishing for Largemouth is kind of like Flag football whereas Musky fishing is more of a  full contact sport, except it involves giant treble hooks too. Largies are fun and games, no one gets hurt and everyone goes home happy and tanned. Muskies? Countless hours, a million dollars invested in gear, cold if not frostbitten, generally no fish and if you are lucky enough to be in the right place at the right time, a good possibibilty of bloodshed. So I'd have to say Musky. Why I have no idea.   When I think about it, a Bass fisherman can be contented. I don't think you will ever find a contented Musky fisherman."

They have a huge geographic range so you can fish them in a lot of different places, catching them with a city skyline as a backdrop or just beautiful bush and anything in between. With varying techniques available for catching them you are able to mesh your mood with whatever style or speed of fishing suits you at the time. The flesh is excellent table fare if you wish and they are also easy to C&R if you choose to do so. They are indigenous to the areas I fish unlike invasive species such as the pacific salmonoids or steelhead/rainbow, goby or asian carp, thus helping to maintain an ecological balance."

Pike are okay in the Spring, but once the water warms up they go deep and you are jigging (Yawn) or tolling...they're out.  Musky fishing had all of my attention for a few years, but a day of casting the heavy tackle wore me out.  I also worried about fishing for them in the Summer.  I hated how hard they were to revive.  Frankly, they are such a great fish that I would rather not catch them, if they might die.  Besides that, some of the Musky crowd are so sickeningly sanctimonious that they could give Aspirin a headache!  That leaves good old Bass... The tackle is light and fun to use.  There are probably more baits made for bass than for all other sport-fish combined.  If you are free to travel, they are open all year.  So that's my choice. "

409597,craigdritchie,2009-12-08 02:48:00,1586,"Probably walleye.  I world become bored if I were stuck to just one fishing scenario for the rest of my days, and that's why walleye would be my choice. For starters, I can fish for them year-round -- you don't have to drive too far to find good walleye fishing 12 months a year. And there's no end to how you can fish for them. I can jig the shallows in spring as post-spawn fish settle into emergent weeds, or cast twitchbaits along shoreline points, or work spinners over offshore saddles and reefs. Or bottom-bounce fast currents in rivers, if I want to break out my waders. I can huck suspending minnowbaits off a pier, or even fish sunken timber with weedless jigs or a little Senko, just for something different.  In summer I can troll big open water with 'riggers or boards, or Lindy Rig mid-lake flats with leeches or crawlers, or throw out a drift sock and toss slip floats or drop-shot rigs. In early summer I can even catch them on topwaters. Rip-jigging the heavy veggies is always fun, or I can wet wade a big river and sneak a few out of the shallows in evenings by casting floating Rapalas. I can drive farther north and fish remote back lakes where walleyes have never seen Shad Raps or Rattle Traps. Or pull spinner rigs over sand flats, in the Kawarthas or on the Great Lakes. Heck, I can even catch them on flies if I really get bored.  Come fall I can target the big girls as they hit up neck-downs and deep weedlines with crankbaits and huge minnowbaits. Or I can tip prop-jigs with shiners and finesse tough fish off of main basin points. Or hit the dams and lake narrows for some night action with swim baits. Or break out those waders again and hit the marsh at night for giants in only inches of water.  I look at ice fishing the same way I look at clogged toilets, letters from Revenue Canada and objects on the bottom of my shoe that I can't identify, but if push came to shove I could even bring myself to once again fish for walleyes through the hard stuff -- again using a huge variety of baits and techniques.  I can catch walleye on pretty much every rod and reel I own -- spinning rods, baitcasters, centrepin rigs, fly outfits, ultra-lights, rigger sticks, even straight graphite crappie poles (don't knock it till you try it!!). None of my tackle would gather dust.  I admit that most walleye fight like a plastic bag, and are about as smart as a bag of rocks, but if nothing else, they're adaptable. So if I was stuck to only fishing for one species for the rest of my days, I'd probably fish for walleye. There's no shortage of different ways to catch them, and nothing else tastes as good when it's fried up in Fish Crisp."

For me that leaves perch, crappie bluegills and walleyes.My 2 favs would be crappie or perch. Bt there is no way I could pick just one."
