411943,irishfield,2009-12-14 23:55:00,26272,Anyone know if you can get a boat up the creek/river from Red Cedar into O-Pee-Chee?  Gerry??  Thanks !
411956,Dutch,2009-12-15 00:21:00,831,"Fished OPC lake a few years back and remember the passage to red cedar looked like more of a portage than a navigable route - maybe in the spring when the water is higher it could be do-able, but would be pretty treacherous.  There is a lodge on the lake, forget what it is called, they may know better."
411963,irishfield,2009-12-15 00:26:00,26272,Yep.. lodge on the lake.. is there any other structure/building on the waterfront of this lake other than the lodge?? How did you access the lake if not through the lodge?
411971,HTHM,2009-12-15 00:34:00,4082,Air? You have that ability I understand...
411977,Spiel,2009-12-15 00:40:00,9065,"You probably know this Wayne but my top maps show a set of rapids between the two lakes. Navigable, I don't know.  I do know that at the other end of Red Cedar up the Temagami River is a large water fall stopping all boat access up to Cross Lake. Sorry that's all I know."
411980,irishfield,2009-12-15 00:42:00,26272,Thanks... knew there was rapids at North end of O-Pee-Chee.. was not sure about South end dumping into Red Cedar
411986,Muskieman,2009-12-15 00:50:00,2472,"EH!  Not sure if I mean the same spot... but I tried this very thing a few years back when some friends rented a cabin there @ O Pee Chee... we tried to meet them ... we could have maybe,  had I had a 12 ft tinny it may have been possible with some wrestling  ... but no way with my big little 14'.

411988,irishfield,2009-12-15 00:56:00,26272,Yep... that winding creek.. was wondering if it was passable!.. and if there is anything else on O-Pee-Chee other than the single lodge and then the rest is all Crown land?
411994,Muskieman,2009-12-15 01:05:00,2472,"  Maybe?.... depends on how much acreage  they own around the lodge... I have yet to find a definitive web site on Ontario's Crown Land.  But aren't there a few boat access only cottages across the bay from ""OPC"" ? I haven't been there in 15 years or so.  RFS "
411996,irishfield,2009-12-15 01:08:00,26272,"I don't see anything else on Google Earth.. although that area isn't of the best resolution to see buildings. Lodge claims it's a ""private lake""."
412042,bow slayer,2009-12-15 02:49:00,1074,"there is only one cottage on the lake besides the camp. IT was for sale back about 15 years ago I went to look at it,the lodge owner drove me over in a boat,the rest is crown land."
412043,irishfield,2009-12-15 02:50:00,26272,Thanks !
412082,bridge,2009-12-15 05:02:00,54,"I've been right up to where O-PEE-CHEE dumps into Red Cedar many times and even in the spring you couldn't get a tinny up there, well I wouldn't try anyways.  I had know idea there was a lodge up the creek though.  How big is the lake the lodge is on."
412101,Gerry,2009-12-15 10:35:00,257,"Wayne,  Sorry for not responding soooner, I was flying back from Florida yesterday. I have not tried it but it is my understanding that you cannot access O-Pee-Chee by boat. In fact if staying at the lodge you must drive about 1 km to the launch area to Red Cedar. Why the interest? If you want to check it out further contact me and you can jump in with me (next summer) and we'll check it out."
412145,irishfield,2009-12-15 15:09:00,26272, It's a fair size lake and the lodge has been there since 1945. Lake is weird shaped..with 4 or 5 arms to it. All of which are a good mile or so long.  Gerry.. thanks !  Wayne

412157,irishfield,2009-12-15 15:33:00,26272,Thanks!
412164,bridge,2009-12-15 15:55:00,54,I don't know if i was looking at the right lake but isn't there some kind of road access off of highway 11.  not sure what kind of shape it would be in.
412183,irishfield,2009-12-15 17:09:00,26272,Just the private road into the lodge AFAIK
