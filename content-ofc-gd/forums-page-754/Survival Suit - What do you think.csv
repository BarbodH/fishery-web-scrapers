411131,crappieperchhunter,2009-12-12 03:43:00,2582,Depends on what fishing you do. If you are outside get a 1pc suit as warm as possible. If inside a portable or permanent hut get a 2 pc so you can shed the jacket when it gets warm. All the brand names make good suits. Know  your prices and look for a deal.  Good luck in your search.
411132,irishfield,2009-12-12 03:45:00,26272,And remember... it's only a floater suit ! It's not a survival suit... You're still going to have to find heat FAST if you take a swim!
411134,Weeds,2009-12-12 03:58:00,782,"  From a guy who really does not not better, are survival suits much better/expensive than floater suits?"
411135,irishfield,2009-12-12 04:09:00,26272,For an example.. this is a survival suit. Delays hypothermia etc.  http://www.mustangsurvival.com/products/category.php?t=4  http://www.mustangsurvival.com/professiona...t_01Apr2009.pdf  ..and even they aren't without issues.  http://www.williamsandcompany.ca/Articles/...val%20Myths.pdf

411144,Handlebarz,2009-12-12 09:56:00,3790,I have the HH (Helly hansen) delta and it is warm enough for me to sit out side all winter on the river here last year we had some major cold days where my only problem is my finger's were freezing but I was warm in the suit I do know a couple people who have the Alpha from HH and say its to warm for fishing in southern Ontario. Check out Angling outfitters they have them for great prices I know they were around $200 last year at the fishing show give the store a call.
411154,Sandbag,2009-12-12 12:00:00,533,Burns Fishing in Burlington has the Helly Hansen Delta for $199.00.  Picked up a new one the other day.  Cheers  Craig

411398,Jer,2009-12-13 01:42:00,1426,"I was in the market for a floater suit as well but couldn't find one that was very comfy. Too stiff and bulky for my liking.  I just bought a Clam Ice Armor coat and bibs today at Gagnons for $270. Seems like an excellent outfit, built for ice-fishing they say. I figger when I feel the need for floatation (out on iffy ice, which I plan to avoid, or in the boat early or late in the season) there is plenty of room inside or outside the coat for a lifejacket."
411401,Handlebarz,2009-12-13 01:51:00,3790, Just remember if you use a life jacket with the heavy winter suit it will suck up alot of water and sink ya even with the life jacket unless its rated for more weight then you will become after being in the water for a while
