Once upon a time I dreamed a younger man's dreams of wealth and independence but then I learned that wealth doesn't give independence. That sucked. So somewhere along the way I forgot those dreams of a windfall.  If I did however come into an unexpected extra million I might then be able to talk my wife into that Kawarthas cottage I'd like, a modest one, and a nice boat. Of course I'm not that old and staid that I wouldn't do my best to have the fastest boat on the lake. She doesn't need to know that though. We're pretty much set for whatever else we want. My car will haul the boat nicely. I guess with what's left over I'd make sure my son had enough seed money to run the business we started. The rest would just go into the retirement fund I suppose. Not a very exciting plan, is it? Well, except for the killer boat.  JF"
