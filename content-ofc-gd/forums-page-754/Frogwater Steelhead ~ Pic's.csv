411125,MJL,2009-12-12 02:55:00,2427,"Great report as usual Mike…Congrats to the both of you.  Also great tips for sure.  Your self cocking floats with the leadcore sounds very interesting.  When I was a kid learning how to float fish for steelhead, I grew up fishing with a few ex-pat Brits who fished my home rivers – They were finesse freaks running #6 or #8 shot all the way down from the float to the hook (usually #16 - #20 spade end hooks) and they never used more than 4lb line (mainline).  They used to make their own floats as well that were self-cocking out of goose or porcupine quills.  One of them gave me a book they brought over from the UK for his own kids (Which I guess they didn’t have much interest in reading – It was still in its plastic wrap)…It sort of outlines the floats they used to use in the frogwater on my local rivers…Here’s a scan:    I’ve always been interested in making these floats myself but never fancied grabbing onto an angry goose’s ass to try to harvest some quills   …Might give the leadcore a try myself instead this winter"

410666,strakey,2009-12-10 19:19:00,78,"I know the comment is tongue and cheek. I fish frog water all the time as most of my fishing is done with fidel. The only different brand i fish is the credit, i have no time to hit the others. I have a hard time reading rivers like the lower humber that have been dug out for boaters.  Im just trying to get a few pointers from the resident guru before you charging for consults."
410668,BillM,2009-12-10 19:24:00,17367," Yeah, that was one of mine..  It was a little weird looking...  Other side was fine..  I was about to take a pic of the good side when it decided it didn't want to lay there anymore and swam away, lol"
410672,solopaddler,2009-12-10 19:32:00,8605,  You and Fidel will have to join me for a day if the opportunity presents itself. I'd like to pick your brain about the area north of V-town anyway.
410678,strakey,2009-12-10 20:06:00,78,"Sure just give me a time so i can get out of my ""shackles"" as fidel would say. She can't say no to a 3-some"
410684,Paulus,2009-12-10 20:28:00,522," But where the trough is for the boats is basically what Mike aims for. You can't really read that at the surface, unless the water has a certain clarity - then you can more or less judge by the water's hue. Still, there's a relatively good amount of trial and error involved, even to the day. I've fished a lot of frog water, and in 8' of water I've caught them in less than 3' and more than 6'. The biggest trick is to time your visit with the arrival of fish; otherwise you won't know if you're doing it right.   Shackles? 3-some?    p.-"
410750,ccmtcanada,2009-12-10 23:08:00,7971,Great stuff guys!!!  Been too long since I've been hunting steelhead....
410780,highdrifter,2009-12-11 00:13:00,2534,Great spot to kill time!  It's like casting into the void there..  Whatcha want is that deep slack water at the foot of the rapids in the Humber..  I can feel that you're getting closer..  very close now..  HD 
410788,DRIFTER_016,2009-12-11 00:20:00,10439, Well todays temps here are mind numbingly cold!!! Coldest day of the winter so far with a balmy daytime high of -35C. Luckily it's not windy though so the windchill is only -46C!!!!!!  -10 is tee shirt weather!!!!!!

410792,solopaddler,2009-12-11 00:37:00,8605,  Ironically my better half is out right now getting her hair done then shopping. My 2 little ones are currently running amok and inconsolable. I'm thinking I need the number for nanny 911.  During steelhead season I arrange to have 2 days free and clear each week (sometimes one). They tend to keep me sane and fortunately my wife agrees.
410796,misfish,2009-12-11 00:49:00,29133,"What is ""frog water""? Is it pea green water?  New saying to me."

410799,Joeytier,2009-12-11 00:50:00,3990,Another excellent report.  I never thought I'd ever be this excited to be back in southern Ontario.  I've got the itch...bad.
410812,solopaddler,2009-12-11 01:05:00,8605, Frogwater is a descriptive term used to describe water that's teeming with frogs. The fish are attracted to and excited by the frogs and that usually means good fishing.    (I'm in a sassy mood. Frogwater=slow moving water with little or no visible current)  
410814,Harrison,2009-12-11 01:13:00,2202,"Hence, frog cross with no effort..but can be challenging steelhead water."
410815,DRIFTER_016,2009-12-11 01:14:00,10439,"  Mike Haven't you figured out that to get them little buggers in line at this time of year you just have to tell them to smarten up or you'll tell santa that they've been bad. No toys for you, just coal!!!!! Works every time. If it doesn't make sure you hide all the gifts and wrap a couple of chunks of coal up for them on the big day. After they have spent 30 minutes or so freaking out you can tell them that if they promise to be really good that santa may forgive them and bring their gifts!!!!"
410816,solopaddler,2009-12-11 01:19:00,8605,  I already told them Santas angry brother Dave was gonna visit us over christmas from the north pole. That he's gonna be checking up on 'em..  They weren't impressed.

410980,corvette1,2009-12-11 19:19:00,1765,awesome report as allways congrats mike& bill m
410566,solopaddler,2009-12-10 16:13:00,8605,"As long as steelhead are running, the lower end of the rivers, the estuaries, are always a good bet. Usually the water is slower and deeper near the lakes offering the fish more security. The closer to the lake you are the more apt you are to stumble upon fresh run fish as well. There's usually always a few freshies poking their nose in for a look to go along with the staler, darker fish that have been there for a while.  Slower water means a refinement in tactics. Longer slender pencil floats are used, the dead slow water not conducive to a more buoyant oval or round style. In clear water many times self-cocking pencil floats are used. Leadcore trolling line is stripped of it's outer sheath and wrapped around the bottom stem of the float and epoxied. This allows you the ultimate in stealthy presentations: float, long fluoro tippet with no shot and your bait, jig or fly. When fish are wary this particular method of rigging will account for a few more fish. Speaking of jigs this type of water is tailor made for them. If there's enough wind kicking up a small chop to bob your float up and down all the better. With no wind a small twitch every now and again will make the jig pulsate under your float and incite strikes. In the ice cold water of early winter jigs will work 1000 times better if they're tipped with something. Usually that something being alive and wriggling and adding much needed scent. Maggots (yes maggots  ) are the preferred choice. Many times one is all you'll need, although sometimes 2 or 3 work even better. They're small enough that they don't impede the action of the jig yet are still an amazing attractant. Beyond maggot tipped jigs the obvious choice is fresh skeined roe, the softer and gooier the better. In the dead slow water skein imparts an incredible amount of scent and tends to draw a lot of strikes.  Recently Bill and myself fished a favoured estuary and hit a good number of steelhead on both skein and maggot tipped jigs. Many of the fish were virtual slabs of chrome, fresh run, thick of shoulder and deep of belly and an absolute blast to catch. Even with the water being so cold some of these fish surprised me with the speed of their runs, they were electric. In this type of water the hits themselves were breathtaking. While some were subtle pecks most were absolutely savage with the float literally being ripped under. Watching that happen in such slow water is more than half the fun for me! All in all it was a fantastic day of winter steelheading, the only downside being the drive home. In the late afternoon heavy lake effect snow began to fall covering everything including the highway. The drive home was a bit dicey, but ultimately we made it...  I'll let the pictures tell the rest of the story.                                                   Cheers,  Mike"

(And no worries there's plenty of fish left to be caught.  )    Forgot about that. While I was embedding my fingers into the steering wheel trying to keep us both alive and get us home Billy was in a coma."
410600,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-12-10 16:51:00,0,nice fish.  i've never floated any estuary water like that...the calm water is sort of intimidating with a float...  i've spincasted the mouths of streams with hardware...  i got 53 cm of snow with my cold this weekend...on the drive back to the sault on sunday all of the tribs were 3/4 frozen... time to start digging out my brookie gear methinks!

410609,strakey,2009-12-10 17:20:00,78,"I have a question from the rube section of your following here..........When fishing the bigger waters like the ones in your pictures how far are you casting into the rivers to find these steelies. I fish the humber as i live it beside it and the mouth is wide like your ""magic rivers"".  ******nice fish porn"
410610,troutologist,2009-12-10 17:22:00,951,"Right on, some nice fish there for sure.  I've had a lot of luck with waxies at various times of the year. This spring in MI they were the ticket."
410611,solopaddler,2009-12-10 17:34:00,8605," The rube section?  It depends on where the channel, trough, slot is. At one point I was fishing a seam 10' in front of me. In other spots I was casting to the middle and more towards the other side. If you live beside the Humber then you have a perfect opportunity to learn the topography of the riverbed. That's what you have to do to fish that type of water effectively. As an aside an experienced eye should be able to read water like that and know where to fish without any prior knowledge of the river. It's just something that comes with experience.  (The rivers I fish aren't magic.  )"

410637,strakey,2009-12-10 18:35:00,78," The rube comment is from the other day when i recommended siglon f for floatfishing. AAAAnnnnnnnyyyyways the mouth of the humber is deep and wide, no seams just constant wave action, probably better bottom bouncing. It narrows past the lakeshore to more like your style, but it is slow and the bottom is muddy and about 5-7'. Again no seam, structure or pocket water. thats my dilemma. I usually tend to go elswhere or up river, but your post is inspiring."
410642,BillM,2009-12-10 18:45:00,17367," I've never chummed(unless you count throwing a busted bag into the river), although I got a buddy that does extremely well with it when things get low and clear."

410652,solopaddler,2009-12-10 18:56:00,8605,  No we stung every single fish.  (It's childs play when you're fishing a stocked ditch while hurling out buckets of chum. Right?  )
