411682,Muskieman,2009-12-13 22:35:00,2472,  C'est pas mal cute!!!   RFS 
411686,Leecher,2009-12-13 22:45:00,7832, Merci Randy!!!
411692,Radnine,2009-12-13 23:23:00,1538,I love it! It really is very cool. How did you come up with the design (what is it's significance)? Jim
411699,Leecher,2009-12-13 23:50:00,7832," Thanks Jim!!!  Hunting was the theme for this design.... since I had made a few plaques last fall after deer hunting, wanted to stay on this topic and the center piece is a view through a riffle scope aiming at a target..... you can actually see 3 shots group in the 10 ring, center black circle....  After that was made, had to think of the layout of the game...... since the center piece took most of the plaque space, had to figure it out.....  and came up with going along the contour of the plaque.  I always stamp the year and OFC was added since I'm a member of this board and thought it was appropriate. The URL is for advertising only..... want the people I play against to see it and hoping they'll visit the site in the future.  So that pretty well sums it up for this design...... it's all about how I feel looking at the original piece of wood and how I can make a unique design on it..... that's what I truly enjoy and like.   Takes some time to figure it out but so rewarding when I see the end results  Hope this answers your question and thanks again Jim Jacques"
