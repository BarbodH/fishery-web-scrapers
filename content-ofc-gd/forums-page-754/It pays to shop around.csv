Then we found quite a number of the regular winter lures at a very good percentage lower at LeB than BPro.  I asked if BPro could price match, sure, bring in the catalogue, see if it's in stock, etc.  you want my money, you do the hoops and loops.   To top it off the staff at LeB have gotten quite the customer happiness attitude lately, I guess it pays off.  At BPro it was like we were bothering them this morning with a few questions."

411660,msp,2009-12-13 21:55:00,1336,Im surprised that you got good customer service at Lebarons. I would rather pay the extra $ to do business with the smaller family run stores where they actually treat you like a person.
411726,vinnimon,2009-12-14 01:55:00,2593,"Lebarons is topr for me when in the area.Good prices and selection.I go elsewhere to a family run bus and get the same.Since its close to me.But as I had mentioned earlier on another post.Bps threw me a doozie.Out shopping for a floater suit,and brought the next years catalogue of lebarons with me for comparison in prices and such.I never showed them but bps were willing to match and beat by 10%.When I showed the following years catalogue and all,guess what.The catalogue is out of date and bps will not match prices.How is it out of date when there is 2 months togo before years end and its next years catalogue.I bought a raven float rod a year earlier.from a family owned bus. when I visited bps,The same rod sold for $30 more than the family run shop a year later.thanks bps for my time and trouble."
