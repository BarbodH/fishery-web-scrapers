412272,Terry,2009-12-15 22:24:00,14456,"I thought someone would  give me a ""P"" followed by a,...aaah never mind  must be too far in history"
412277,misfish,2009-12-15 22:44:00,29133," I,ll give you a P and raise you  L A K E."
412286,Roy,2009-12-15 23:03:00,13728,I'll give you an 'S' and introduce you to Petawawa Sportsman Show and their smart looking banner on our board.
412301,HTHM,2009-12-15 23:49:00,4082,"Banner or not, I consider the OP to be spam. How about an introduction, and lead in to the promotion on the board. A blatant plug for their product, (Petawawa Sportsman Show), posed as a question to the board is in poor taste IMHO. Remember my opinions may not neccessarily be the same as others' (yours) opinions. I recall a thread not too long ago that a bunch of tighty whities got bunched up as well. I hope this does not turn into that type of thread."
412327,boaterguy,2009-12-16 00:34:00,6," Nah, Just a newbie looking to be welcomed here.  Ever hear of a Goby?  I made another post here about a strange fish I once caught.  You guys figured it out from my description right away!!!"
412336,Roy,2009-12-16 00:59:00,13728, You did good Albert. We'll try to change this silliness that we call a business/community plan to fit into your daily moods. Thanks for being so vigilant.
