411341,JohnF,2009-12-12 22:07:00,3494,"I know we've had lots of discussions but with the ever changing world of technology I wondered what the smart buy (for about $200) in portable gps was at the moment. I need to buy one for a gift, hence the $200 limit. I have a Lowrance ZOG that's been great but they don't seem to be available now. There's a Garmin 265? for just under $200. Any better ideas? I've gotta do a run into the Big Smoke before Christmas so I could pick one up there if I knew where to go.  Thanks JF  JF"
411342,fishinguypat,2009-12-12 22:14:00,547,i have the garmin 260 and it's good so you might want to look into that...although i know some other companies have good gps too
411434,bigfish1965,2009-12-13 03:36:00,3382,The Tom Toms are affordable and work well.
411510,HTHM,2009-12-13 14:22:00,4082,"Is it for driving or for boating? Driving I would suggest the Garmin, boating I have no idea."
411513,JohnF,2009-12-13 14:30:00,3494," Just for driving. I kinda figgered the Garmin was still the goto unit for most folks. I want one with voice insructions, colour, and a decent screen size.  JF"
411593,JohnF,2009-12-13 18:27:00,3494,Just picked up a Garmin Nuvi 265W for $165 @ Circuit City (Radio Shack). Special price this weekend apparently. It seems like a nice unit with an easy to use menu.  JF
411616,fishinguypat,2009-12-13 19:16:00,547,yeah ... i used my jps for picking up my daughter in toronto and let me tell you gps don't work well under bridges

411624,JohnF,2009-12-13 19:42:00,3494, Thanks. I'll do that on my own as soon as I get it back. I figgered getting Matt one for Christmas was the only sure way of getting mine back.  JF
411629,icedude,2009-12-13 19:58:00,459,Appreciated--OFC helps again!  that's why i visit this wonderful place almost daily  you saved me a bunch of due dilligence here--GPS units.... what a crowded field to find a recommended unit-simple to navigate for a good price from cats you can trust  Have A Cool Yule All!  Hug a Mod  Play Safe on the Ice  Cheers  ID1
411646,JohnF,2009-12-13 20:59:00,3494," And thanks for the feedback and suggestions, y'all. I kinda knew this was the way to go from earlier threads but a last check never hurts.  JF"
411655,lew,2009-12-13 21:36:00,12766,"I've been using that 265W for a year now John and it's an excellent unit. The directions given are usually very accurate and the voice prompts are extremely clear.  It's great when hooked up in conjuction with your cell phone and receiving calls is as simple as touching the screen, and to make outgoing calls is also only a couple finger touches in the units phone book. Sound quality is very good for both listening to incoming calls and also for talking to someone else.  Amazing how the price comes down so dramatically on electronics as that same unit was $365 this time last year at Best Buy and Santa got it for me on sale for $300  BTW, The Source was selling it for $500 a year ago"
411662,JohnF,2009-12-13 21:58:00,3494,  Thanks Lew. Now I wanna keep it for myself.  JF
411665,danbouck,2009-12-13 22:02:00,4380,I have a couple Garmins and a couple tomtoms. I prefer the tomtoms over garmin just because of how the display is. They are both good quality and accurate.
