411910,gogu392,2009-12-14 22:04:00,142,"I will go for: => LCD now is the best, in 5 years from now probably OLED => resolution 1080p => Brands: Samsung, Toshiba. Sony is expensive but best quality. => if you live in 70-80km range of GTA check to have a ATSC tuner built in. Just hook a regular antena and you have at leat 10 HD channels for free of charge (no need to have cable). (Canadians and US channels) => Best store with a lot of choices and good prices: Costco. Greate return policy also. => Check you room dimesions. You should not chose a big TV for a small room. Ideal the distance from screen to your eyes should be at least 5-6 diagonals of TV. Best position for TV is under or at eye level. You should not raise your eyes to see the TV. Enjoy."
411925,Jonny,2009-12-14 22:52:00,1380," Useful advice, except for this part, IMO.  Personally I think this is way off. In our TV room we watch a 40"" LCD from about 11 feet away. The rule-of-thumb suggested above works out to a minimum viewing distance of about 16 feet for our TV, but 11 feet is plenty far enough. Even a 42"" or 50"" HDTV would work out fine at 11 feet. When we buy another TV, 50"" will be our choice."

412067,John Bacon,2009-12-15 03:53:00,3277, That is a more updated formula.  If you sat that close to an older TV's would be able to see how granular the picture was.  That is not an issue with a modern high definition TV.  The better the picture quality the closer you can sit or put a bigger TV in a smaller room.

412302,Jonny,2009-12-15 23:52:00,1380," You don't, actually. There are only a few manufacturers of video equipment, and a lot of the ""budget"" brands are simply re-branded by them.   I think DVD's will be around for a long time to come. If you look around you can find considerable consumer resistance to newer formats. Personally I'm still not sold on Blu-Ray. The machines are getting less expensive but changing format doesn't seem worth it to me yet.

Plasma sucks if you live at high altitudes  LCD w/ backlit LED is the way to go but is $$ right now  OLED is beautiful but $3000 for a 11"" screen ahah  LCD is def the winning standard with the best performance for its price  Samsung, LG are great models..  stay away from Sony, they over-sharpen their colors on their TV's to state a higher contrast ratio but it definately effects standard viewing quality when lights are on in the room.  I got mine from Tiger Direct, it was an olivea they have gone out of business but Samsung's Firmware updates work on it so I get all the new features even though my tv is 2 1/2 years old  I paid $1900 for my 52""  This would be worth $1100  now if you got it in a store  If you buy a 40"" + LCD and spend between $800 - $1100 you are going to be happy with it.

It's hooked up to Rogers HD dual PVR and I've yet to be more impressed with regards to picture quality from any friends setup.  Of course blueray in true 1080p trumps anything but it's still impressive.  Keep in mind distance from the TV is also important with regards to size of your television.  If you're sitting 6-7ft from a 50"" set watching a standard definition station it simply isn't going to look great at all and the fact is a ton of channels you probably watch are not available in HD and if they are might cost you a good few bucks to purchase them."

I googled it and low and behold, Samsung is notorious for this - cheap components.  The lucky part is that it happened exactly 2 days before the 2 year warranty expired.  And better yet, it was in-home service for parts and labour - so no cost or inconvenience to me and easy to file the claim (with original receipt).  The tech did say this will likely happen again in 2 years.  So at a cost of $800 to replace the mother board, I won't likely do it if it happens again --> so that means I bought a $1500 TV for only 4 years!  Oh well, I vowed never to buy Samsung again."

I personally just bought a 720p 42"" plasma just because of the price and the reviews of the model.  As well I opted to go for 720p instead of 1080p because at 42"" it's really hard to see the difference. 1080p only really matters when your considering 47"" or higher.  As well the refresh rate on a plasma is must better than on a LCD since there are still issues with Ghosting.  As well, plasma burn-ins are pretty much a thing of the past.  Newer Plasma TVs have built in pixel orbiters which ensures that this doesn't happen and if it does, then you got yourself a lemon.

LED, more expensive, image quality, WOW, super thin! but again, once you have your tv in your living room and watching high def it will look good no matter what if you shopped around and picked the one that looked good to you.  last note: SAMSUNG, outstanding quality or Pioneer, or pioneer elite.

410339,DRIFTER_016,2009-12-09 22:22:00,10439,  You need to think of how you watch TV as well. Do you like to watch in the dark or a well lit room? Do you watch sports? Plasmas do better in a darker enviroment due to the gloss front while the LCD's shine in a brighter room. Plasmas tend to have better blacks than LCD TV's If you watch sports get a plasma or an LCD with a 240 hz refresh rate. The so called LED TV's (they are actually LCD with LED back lighting) produce better blacks than the CCFL (normal LCD units).  For me the best fit is an LCD (LED back lit) 240 hz refresh rate TV. Now I just need the $$$$$ to buy it!!!!.  If you watch sports Buy the 240 hz refresh rate LCD or you will be disappointed.
410347,tjsa,2009-12-09 22:35:00,1578,"Hey Ron, if you can wait a day, I can get you the specs on the recent LG plasma we bought for work at Future Shop. It is a 50"" unit, full glass surface, 2 HDMI inputs, video input, VGA input, composite input, cable input, and component input, and for the low low price of $999.99.  It's lovely. It might have been a sale item, cannot remember. We need them with VGA inputs for our use, lots of either LCD, LED, or Plasmas are now coming out without that input. But, you can buy adapters to convert VGA to HDMI, you just usually lose the audio, and have to supply audio separately. I am sure there are dongles or adapters out there to solve that, you would just have to route the audio to your home stereo system instead of to the flat screen.  One guy at work purchased a Samsung 46"" for his wife last Christmas, based the size on the room he was going to put it into and the viewing distance. The 50"" would have been overkill. And Samsung says their units will last for 60,000 hrs. That's a long time if you only use it evenings and weekends.  We have Sony plasmas around campus that had been running 24/7 since August of 2003. The units are failing now, but not because of any bulb or flourescent failure, it is power supply and input board issues. Replace for $1,000.00, or repair for $700.00, you do the math.  And we are of the opinion, it does not matter which major brand you chose, since we took apart one of the Sony's, and found an LG board inside it, lol!! It all depends on your use. Viewing angle is still better with plasmas vs. LCD, no idea about LED, we haven't used one yet.  Also, we have not used any DLP displays yet, so I cannot say anything about them."

I may just be trying to justify the money I spent but I've not seen a set with a better picture and when I had a minor issue that required service Panasonic was excellent. The service guy came to the house the day after I reported it and fixed the issue plus taking the time to show me a few setup tricks to avoid weird picture distortion.

410459,SBCregal,2009-12-10 03:40:00,688,"im pretty sure the plasmas are starting to be phased out.  they get real hot, and they consume much more power than an lcd or led tv (apparently alot dont get an energy star rating).  that being said...the picture tends to be a bit nicer on them (i find)  also the plasmas come with a glass front which is bad for glare if you have any lights/windows that can be reflected in the screen."
410466,bigfish1965,2009-12-10 04:09:00,3382,I bought an LG LCD. At the casino all of our TV's are LG LCD and they are on 24/7 and so far (5 yrs) only a few have failed...like was said earlier it was power supplies that went on them...not the screen. I don't know but seems like leaving them on all the time may cause them to last longer.
410470,cram,2009-12-10 04:33:00,1733,"Ron,  You only need to know a few things....  - if the TV is on a main floor (or anywhere it'll get sunlight) and you plan on watching when the sun is up, you'll ABSOLUTELY need an LCD or LED.   Plasma has WAY too much reflection and glare for anything other than a closed room or basement.  You'll find in some tv stores that the plasmas are always in a back corner where there's little light.  - if in a basement, you will be fine with either. Plasma has an arguably better picture, but it also gets hot.  LCD isn't quite as nice for high speed stuff (like sports), but the delta between the two is closing fast.   Plasma is pretty much on its way out.  - I don't know plasma but if you get an LCD samsung and LG are pretty good value buys (i just got a 50 inch LG a month ago).   I could not see a difference in the picture btwn these and the more expensive Sony...maybe someone can, but not me.  - if you get LCD, an important spec that is often under-valued is refresh rate....the speed by which your screen ""refreshes"".  Whne the rate is slow, faster moving objects look blurry (they're moving faster than the picture is refreshing).   I forget the different levels (something like 60 megahertz/second, 120, or 240).  The highest level likely doesn't matter unless you watch nascar or LOTS of sports.  Get the middle (this is what i did).   Do NOT get the lowest one.  - when you do buy, do NOT let them sell you on their expensive cables (usually called monster cables)....its Bull.  The lowest quality HDMI or component cables will generate just as good a picture.  - same goes with set-up or installation service....they will try to sell you a service to come and ""fine tune"" your tv, and will likely show you a tv that has been ""tuned"" to see the difference.  Its Bull.   You can tune yourself with your eyes, and or look up generally preferred settings for each model online."
410472,SRT8 smoker craft,2009-12-10 04:37:00,1107,I have had my cheapo lcd for 5 years with no problems so far but pic quality is not as good as samsung or LG but it was half the price.
410480,BillM,2009-12-10 04:56:00,17367,"If I could have one TV it would be a Pioneer Kuro Elite...  If I couldn't have that, it would be a Panny plasma..  Now, if I was putting this TV in a well lit room, it would be LCD for sure..  All depends on where the TV is going to be, what you'll mostly be viewing on it, and what you want to spend..."

410491,GoneFishin,2009-12-10 07:01:00,349, You've got it a bit backwards. Plasma tv's you will need to replace the bulb every so often and I wouldn't recommend even considering lol . LCD's you just have to watch out for burnt out pixels but that will most likely only happen if it's physically damaged. And LED tv's are just about the same as LCD tv's except instead of using flouresent lights to light behind the LCD panel they use LED's. Makes for better picture quality and a thinner tv  .. lol
410506,wallyboss,2009-12-10 12:23:00,1095,"Where is the tv going Dark or lots of light is pretty well the main thing that should effect the decision of which kind to buy??  The rest is price.  The higher the refresh rate for an LCD the better (but the pricier it is) I have a 52"" Samsung that I bought last year and it only has 60hz refresh rate and I have seen only a few times when there was a bit of break up but I am not a big sport watching guy.   120hz will run you 200-300 more. 240 hz a lot more.   Most Plasma have a refresh rate of 600hz so it would be plasma that I would buy if my family room didn't have 3 huge picture windows and a patio door."
410508,Garnet,2009-12-10 12:32:00,2056,The 2 best when I bought 18 months ago were Pioneer and the Panasonic 1080p. They were both head and shoulders above the other plasma. The screen update of plasma is wild. In nascar you will see how loose the cars are. When watching movies look at the black suits along the shoulder line good plasma are straight and solid. My living room is very bright and I have no problem with reflection.  If I was looking now the LG plasma 1080p would get serious consideration.  The Sharp LCD was by far the best.  We have rogers and could not go with out the PVR. Any live TV and you miss something just hit rwd need a snack just hit pause. Recording a show is so easy I do it.  Get a surround sound you will have a lot less hair when you get it hooked up but well worth it.  Garnet
