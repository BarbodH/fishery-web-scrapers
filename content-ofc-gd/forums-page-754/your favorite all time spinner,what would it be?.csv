411181,dave524,2009-12-12 13:42:00,4508," That too, has been my favourite for small stream specks, often with a bit of orange in the feather dressing too along with the black."
411183,BillM,2009-12-12 13:52:00,17367," The reason why I like them so much is that it doesn't take much current, or a fast retrieve to get the blade going..   I love fan casting these things and letting them sit infront of log jams, etc..."
411187,laszlo,2009-12-12 14:10:00,487,If just one it would have to be #3 Mepps Aglia Silver Blade with Hooks Dressed in Black.

I can toss it all spring for shallow lakers and big fat pike.    And this coming summer we'll see how it does 30-40 feet down on the lead core...or possibly behind the dipsy"

411241,Fishnwire,2009-12-12 16:08:00,983,Hard to go wrong with a #3 Mepps Black Fury.  I like burning it in fast enough to bulge the wake a bit like a top-water.
