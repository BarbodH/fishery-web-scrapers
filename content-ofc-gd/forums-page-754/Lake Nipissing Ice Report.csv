411688,Mike01,2009-12-13 22:58:00,378,The lake has finaly started to ice up.  We have had some cold days over the last couple weeks but the wind has kept most of the lake open.  Callander bay is almost frozen over so is the South shore area.  If all goes according to plan I won't have to use my kayak on the 1st!!
