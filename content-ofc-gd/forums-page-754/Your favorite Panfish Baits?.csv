411813,Fishnwire,2009-12-14 15:19:00,983,"I like to take little jigging spoons, remove the treble, tie on 6-12 inches of fluoro, then tie on a #6 or #8 octupus hook.  Sometimes I use a little teardrop jig instead on a plain hook.  You see them in the magazines referred to as dropper rigs.  On the hook I put a power grub and then a live pinhead shinner.  It good for jigging but you can deadstick it too.  This board is full of good ideas though.  Some I use and some I'm gonna use."

It's only my third season hitting hte ice, and I'm still relatively new to chasing panfish on the hard stuff.  So my question is what are your top baits for pannies?  I mostly target perch, mainly on deep weed flats in 18 to 25 fow.  So far Ive had mixed success with small buckshot spoons, and jigs tipped with minnows.  What are your go to baits?  For perch, bluegill and crappie?  Man I just can't stop thinking about it! haha  Cheers, Ryan"
411443,Curtis,2009-12-13 04:12:00,83,"I haven't used them alot myself but i have seen friends have excellent luck with dropper spoon rigs, take the hook of your buck shot and add about 2-4"" of line on the snap ring, then tie on a small hook and add a minnow or even just a minnow head, perch eyes work amazing to but im not sure if thats legal..  I have a lot of good luck with baits tipped with shrimp for crappies too. If the fish aren't bitting try dead sticking with something as simple as a small salted crappie tube you will be suprised how many bites you get.  The biggest must have for panfish in my opinon is a good rod, something really lite with 2-6lb test"

411535,DANIMAL,2009-12-13 15:18:00,215,  I was told by a CO that as long as you keep the fish for consumption you can use the eyes or any other part of it not fit for comsumption.  As for panfish baits I usually use a small jig tipped with magots or minnows.

Here's something I've always wondered.... where do you get live maggots?!?  And if I decided I wanted to salt and freeze some minnows, what the best way of going by doing that?  I always have some die off on me and would rather salt and freeze them than waste them....  Cheers, Ryan"

411650,crappieperchhunter,2009-12-13 21:03:00,2582,  I'll second the jigging rap. Size #2...the smallest they have or #3.  Firetiger or perch pattern..Tip with power maggots...Neon Pink works best on Simcoe for me. Or even better if you can get them...tip with real maggots. Always the first thing down the hole for me when I'm targeting perch.  My 2nd choice would be a Simcoe Bug...I make my own...but I am not sure how they work outside of Simcoe/Couch for perch. However I made smaller ones last winter and the smelt really liked them in the spot that Bigugli took me to last winter.  Good luck with the perching. I'm waiting patiently  :wallbash:     for my traditional first ice trip to Couch for a feed of perch.

411697,Handlebarz,2009-12-13 23:49:00,3790,Ryan I know that BPS has them in Ohio I use them alot with the other gulp stuff some times I will just use the tail or the body mix it up always works great when the bite slows down you can even bie regluar gulp down just remember that if it has metal flake in it IT IS METAL and hurts like anything when it gets stuck between a couple teeth.

411722,Ramble,2009-12-14 01:19:00,713,"Thought I would share some of mine, in the hopes of maybe learning something new from you guys.  Most of my perching gets done on Quinte, with relatively, low pressured fish. But I've had the same sort of stuff work on Simcoe and another small lake I go to occasionally.  Colours  Chartreuse and lime green are the 2 most productive colours I find. If you incorporate that with glow or silver and you’re set. Orange is a close second and gold is almost as good as the silver…almost.  Lures  Most people use small baits when targeting perch. I have found bigger is better, especially for the jumbos, although I usually start smaller at the beginning. One of my favourite “big” lures it the large buckshot rattle-spoon. The treble is too big for most perch, so I switch it out for one off a Forage Minnow. A little bigger split ring helps them “suck it in” but I don’t think it’s essential at all. I’ll tip it with a minnow head, or a tail. I prefer heads generally.    Same hook strategy for other lures like the do-jigger, sidewinder and pimple have all seen action and landed fish.  When they are being “finicky” I have found scaling up the lure size some days will out fish some of the fineness stuff. Which begs the question are they finicky at all? But that’s a different debate.  When they get finicky, the traditional small pan fish gear like this little jig with a small minnow head can be dynamite. I haven’t had a whole lot of luck with maggots or other artificial products. I find the perch in chasing more often then not want meat.    Set Line  Those little jigs at the bottom of a set line rig have also iced fish on slow days. I use the head/jig rig as mentioned above then 5-8 inches above it I’ll stick a lively minnow on the line. I have had more success with fake maggots on this set up, then just jigging them.  For the upper hooks on a set line I have tied marabou and a little crystal flash on a hook. I’ve tried it in orange, pink and chartreuse. The chartreuse out fishes the other colours I’ve tired. The perch love it.  I’ve also seen some positive results from crappie and brookies on it.    The other set up I like on a set line utilizes a floating jig head. I’ll stick two or three split shot on the line about 3 inches up the line from a floating jig head. Then 5-8 inches above the split shot, a single hook with marabou. It’s good if they are active and you need to get the line down fast, you can just add more weight. I’ve tried the weight, the floating jig, followed by the single hooks, but the floating head at the ends works better. Again, chartreuse or orange for the floating head.    Rod Addition  Probably the most important improvement I have ever come across is one of the most simple. Add some small gauge wire on to the rod tip.    It’s A LOT more sensitive than even my ultra light rod and it registers anything that’s going on at the other end. It just bends when you fight the fish and has never caused a tangle yet. It also knocks the water off the line before the guides and I found that I ice up less frequently and when I do its easier to fix.  The weight of pretty much any lure bends it to some degree. This allows you to see if a fish picks up the bait but doesn’t pull. It’s also pretty useful on the setlines because you can see the minnows flopping around. This applies to more then just perch. Often you will see the minnows get more frantic before a fish hits. It also lets you know when to jiggle the line and wake them up or if you get robbed and didn’t see the hit.  You can go buy specific wire, but the 2nd last string (B string) on an acoustic guitar is pretty much perfect. Wrap it on with some Kevlar string with your bobbin if you’re a fly tier or some 4 or 6lb line works in a pinch. I suppose thread would work as well. Cover in epoxy and go fishing. A little paint is nice and a bead over the spot where you twisted the wire to make the loop will bring the ladies running.  Anyway those are some of the tricks I’ve picked up over the last few years."
411748,The Urban Fisherman,2009-12-14 03:19:00,2050," This is the only gulp fish fry I can find around here Jacques.... the ones you have look more like mini split tail minnows, and the ones I found look like a piece of worm with a little tail! haha  http://www.basspro.com/webapp/wcs/stores/s...__SearchResults  When I saw your report last year I was like ""I gotta get me some of those"" and haven't managed to find any.. have to admit though, I only checked BPS and CT.
