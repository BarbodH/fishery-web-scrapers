411694,msp,2009-12-13 23:39:00,1336,"Hey guys, i was just going through some of my pictures from this fall and thought that I would share some of my bass photos with you all. We had an amazing fall this year chasing bass but November in particular was a great month with a couple of 50 fish days. Slowing down presentations was key to getting good hook ups. Senkos, Jig n Pigs and even Jerk baits all produced fish. We witnessed the ""fall feedbag phenominon"" at its finest. The bass seemed to be schooled up pretty good. When we found one we found many. Sorry for the late report but I suppose that its better late than never. Good luck to all the guys on the hardwater this season. Enjoy the pics.               "

""nice job mike..any of them there fish on the jigs you got from me????"" Sorry Todd, I wish that I could say yes but I had a bad rust incident this summer. I lost about 20 jigs. Let me know if you will have any more available before bass season starts next year. I love the custom colours you and your brother make!!!!"
