As most of you know i scored a wicked co op placment/ job/ amazing fishing! I got to spend my entire summer working on the famous Lake Of The Woods! i worked as a Dockhand/ Guide out of Totem Resorts/ Wiley Point. I could go on forever about this place but ill just let the pictures do the talking.  well i started out being able to catch as many walleye off the dock as i wanted!      and same with the pike!       And even the odd muskie was caught! off the dock!   If i remeber corectly there was 6 off the dock this year!  Then it was on to the smallies!     And a bunch of randoms!       me and a guest with a 31.5"" walleye     my little bro with a 29"" walleye his PB    hers a list of my biggest fish: Walleye: 32 inches Pike: 41.5"" Muskie: only a 42"" Bass: 5 lbs multiple 4 plus.. crappie: my pb at just over 16"" no pic tho...  I have hundreds of more photos but i think that give a good summary!  So then its back to school time! lucky for me i can still fish haha. i put up a little video on youtube with only a few pics taken from this year! plenty of steelies have been brought to the net! i personally have caught more steelies this year then ever before! i belive im approching 30 steelhead this fall alone! thats alot for me considering i only got 5 last year!   Anyways thanks for reading i hope u enjoyed it!... I sure did!!"
