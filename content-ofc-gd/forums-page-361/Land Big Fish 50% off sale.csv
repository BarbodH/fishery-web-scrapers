735034,Snidley,2012-10-07 14:51:00,620,www.landbigfish.com is having a 50% off sale. Some really good stuff on the sale. For trollers the Tecotas for $90 seems like a very good deal. I've never ordered from these guys but I'm told by people who have that they are good.
735062,Handlebarz,2012-10-07 19:16:00,3790,A lot of good sales this time of year bass haven has there musky stuff on sale as well as eds bait in wallaceburg. This is the time of year to stock up before its packed away to get the icefishing gear out.
735072,Fisherpete,2012-10-07 20:03:00,1814,"I checked the site out, and the one on sale is the 500 model with no line counter. I have the exact same one already - it is a great reel for musky trolling. If it was the 600 LC I would have ordered a pair at that price...  Pete"
735076,Ainsley,2012-10-07 20:45:00,142,"I was eyeing those tecotas earlier in the week. I'd prefer the line counter though. I also was going to get some rapala clackin cranks, had good luck with the 74 size this year"
