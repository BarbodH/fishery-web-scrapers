734792,icefisherman,2012-10-06 01:52:00,952,Haven't read many recent reports on Lake Simcoe perching this fall. Has the bite in the usual spots started? Barrie? Pefferlaw? May take the kids for half a day of fun as we usually do this time of the year but before burning all the gas better ask if they are biting. Also who has minnows? Caseys?
