735433,Familyfisherman,2012-10-09 18:28:00,188,"So we fished a great lakes trib -- this was my first attempt at using a float reel setup.  We were bottom bouncing.  Ended up with 7 fish landed, others lost...I lost 3 myself -- had trouble feeling the bites, so a few times the fish was on and I was slow to catch up to it.  Fun day and lots left to learn.  Thanks to those who provided guidance...ended up going new with a Fenwick rod and streamside reel that a couple friends had and were happy with.    Kept these for dinner, there were 3 of us.  "

735537,misfish,2012-10-10 09:49:00,29133,"Nice fish Kev. I got a 4 day weekend coming ,to do just that exact thing."
735584,Sinker,2012-10-10 14:15:00,8692,"Am I understanding this right? You were bottom bouncing with a centerpin?  One question....why?  Nice job on the catching, but a spinning reel would be my choice for bottom bouncing.  S."
735595,Rich,2012-10-10 14:41:00,3927,Bottom bouncing with the pin is almost MORE functional than float fishing. Precision drifts without an annoying float to hinder hooksets.
735611,misfish,2012-10-10 15:40:00,29133," I only get annoyed,when they dont go down."
735612,Familyfisherman,2012-10-10 15:43:00,188,"Yes, I found the spinning reel ""pendulumed"" back to me, and I couldn't allow it to free spool the same as the float reel.  The float reel allows me to let the line out at the exact speed of the current due to the lack of friction, and allows for longer drifts.  As my friend who's teaching me says -- ""It puts you right on the hook"".  So far so good...fish seemed to think the presentation was natural  Fun fighting the fish on it as well!"
