Water Temps 46, and the water still very low, and poor visibilty. Mainly fished a chart. spinner bait, and caught a few pike early on. Caught a couple decent bass as well, but it was fairly slow. Then we hit a good bronzie, right before heading up to visit with family and have an amazing meal! Perfect Hope you all had a great day with your families!!!! My Kiddos and the locals  Theres a Bucket! "
