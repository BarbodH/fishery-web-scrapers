Long legged like a flamingo., kinda drab in color. I have never seen them before. There was about 12-15 of them and they where there on the way home too.  I did some googling this morning and it looks like they where sandhill cranes. Just though I would throw this on here in case someone is traveling  in that area anytime soon.  Something rare to see if you have a road trip up there planned."

735573,crappieperchhunter,2012-10-10 13:49:00,2582,Thx for posting that video Dave. Like I mentioned I googled it this morning and they where definitely Sandhills. I have never seen them before in that area so I thought I'd give OFC a heads up if anyone was traveling up Orillia way.
735583,Sinker,2012-10-10 14:12:00,8692,"Yep, sandhills. Pretty neat eh? I've seen them a few times while duck hunting as well. Out west, you can hunt them, and apparently they are really good eating. I'd love to try one!   Enough about the birds, how was the perchin??  S."
735599,crappieperchhunter,2012-10-10 14:52:00,2582,Caught my Shayne  Perchin has been slow this fall...but we always get more then enough to make me happy. As always you know there's a seat in my boat for you if you can stop blasting birds for a day.

Old Report... http://ontariofishingcommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=12010    The Cheepas always had alot of Sandhills along it's river banks.  Noisy bird... like a Blue Heron but just more vocal.  Not sure about eating them Shane???  The elders in Attawapiskat would, but the younger people... nope.  They`d say ""stringy"" and that was coming from a family of boys with the last name Bird."
735618,4x4bassin,2012-10-10 16:21:00,1025,"I have never seen them before untill this year , saw/heard three of them over my house in early summer (NW of Alliston) and they seemed to be fighting . I sure did hear them first , very loud and distictive sound . I also seen a pair mid summer about 30 miles NE of Parry Sound (Dunchurch area)"
735786,Sinker,2012-10-11 03:54:00,8692,out west they call them the ribeye of the sky!  S.
735787,spinnerbaitking,2012-10-11 04:22:00,1622,"Seen 2 or 3 of them every year for about 4 years on a lake in Bruce County & this year we saw 2 of them on 2 different lakes in Bruce County, most of the year & we always hear them before we see them, very interesting bird Tight Lines SBK"
