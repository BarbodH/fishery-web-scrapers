The first year was a shear blast of laughter, last year was a little off beat perhaps due to the warm weather we have experienced. This year I would like to step it up a notch to help out a friend most of us know. Before I reconfigure anything, what I would really appreciate is an opinion to make this contest better for all to enjoy. Hopefully this year will be bigger and better than last year  Cheers and good fishing to all"

I know I enjoyed playing the photo game last year and would have no problem chipping in $10-$20 for a good cause.  Maybe different catagories for photos too. Fish/Non-fish and maybe an oops catagory.  Just ideas. I don't know what you had in mind exactly but I love playing the photo contest and seeing everyone elses great photos."

Jeremy, what you have mentioned sounds good and all but all entries are free regardless. I do have something in mind for a specific registered charity. Rod caster, i will be in touch for sure and thank you again for last years donations Like I said its a little premature and I just want to get the ball rolling sooner than later."
