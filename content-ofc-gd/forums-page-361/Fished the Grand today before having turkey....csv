I've only fished the river a couple of time and never that spot so wanted to give it another try. I didn't say at one place and covered a few hundred meter stretch wanting to explore and look for a decent hole. I caught 4 smallies on the way, nothing impressive (so didn't bother taking pics), all in the rather shallow spots where water wasn't moving too fast (I avoided rapids altogether). Than I found a section with deeper slow moving water and spend an hour there casting twist tails, spiners, spoons, crankbaits and never got a hit! On my way there in the shallows I constantly got hits from fish some barely twice the size of mrTwister on every cast, but no action at all in the deeper water. Why? Which is consistent with my experience at the Thames river. Why is that? I guess small fish tend to stay close to shore in the shallow to hide from larger fish but where is larger fish hiding and how do I get them to bite? I was hoping to get a pike, nice size bass or a walleye..."

If you snag up and can't get it out, let a bunch of line go downstream and give the rod a sharp snap to free it. I only use crank baits while in the boat...."

735139,hotsky,2012-10-08 04:01:00,400,I was there about 1:30 - 4:30 pm...like I said lots of hits (from smaller fish) and caught a few but none in deeper water.
