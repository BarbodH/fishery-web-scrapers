735131,Cudz,2012-10-08 02:55:00,2652,"My favourite combo that I use is my BPS carbonlite 6'6 spinning rod with my abu garcia 601 real.  This setup is very sensitive and I can cast with it all day as it is very light.  Fairly reasonable too.  I drop shot with it, throw senkos with it and throw cranks as well.  I would like to have a 7'0 crucial with a stratic Ci4 2500 size"
734830,Sour_Squirrel,2012-10-06 13:28:00,196,"If you had to get rid of all you rods and reels except for one combo what would your combo be?  My 'ultimate combo' would consist of a 6'8"" St. Croix Legend Tournament spinning (Drop Shot) rod and a Daiwa Fuego 2500 spinning reel. The rod, although is a drop shot rod, is a very versatile rod.   The Fuego is light and smooth.  Let's hear what your combo is...."
734832,Pigeontroller,2012-10-06 13:35:00,2793,Its not possible if you fish multi-species...
734833,SlowPoke,2012-10-06 13:40:00,2984,"Ok Dax, your boat is sinking and you're holding onto your favourite child with one hand and you can only grab 1 rod/reel combo with the other.... what do you do?"
734840,BillM,2012-10-06 14:30:00,17367,"I wouldn't, I fish for way too many different kinds of fish to have a single rod/reel."
734851,Live2fish85,2012-10-06 15:37:00,1633,I have to agree with Dax and Bill.
734853,MCTFisher9120,2012-10-06 15:41:00,3761,"G.Loomis NRX 7'1"" Heavy with a Core 50Mg7...if i had to choose just 1"
734855,Jigger,2012-10-06 16:05:00,1237,"Tell you what, no matter if its on my Compre or the St.croix, my Stradic isnt going anywhere!"
734862,Gregoire,2012-10-06 17:03:00,1397,"If my boat is sinking and I can only grab one thing it is probably my conquest big nasty combo, but I would be tempted to grab my musky box, as that would be much harder to replace."
734865,SlowPoke,2012-10-06 17:32:00,2984,Good point!!! It would be a 'reel' tough decision for me but would probably come down to... Calcutta 200 TE DC on St Croix LT - super sweet crankbait/spinnerbait/swimbait setup and I shudder to think of what it would take to replace it.
734868,DaveMc,2012-10-06 17:54:00,89,"Well, after this year it would be the new Cumara 7'-2"" xfast med dropshot rods with a stradic CI4 2500"
734872,lew,2012-10-06 18:10:00,12766,"Without doubt, the sweetest musky combo I've ever owned is the one I'm currently using for  bucktails & spinnerbaits. It's an 8' medium heavy St. Croix Legend Tournament rod with the split grip handle, paired up with a Calcutta TE 400 and spooled with 80 # Power Pro and 130# Seaguar fluoro leader.  Lotsa $$$$ but well worth every hard earned dime."
734891,MCTFisher9120,2012-10-06 19:57:00,3761,Lot's of Shimano reels favoured here
734893,fishinguypat,2012-10-06 20:11:00,547,"One does not simply have an ""Ultimate Rod"""
734894,salmon,2012-10-06 20:15:00,334,I have gone thru quite a bit of equipment. My fav Daiwa Pixy Type R with Shimano Cumara 7-2 ft J
734895,Spiel,2012-10-06 20:20:00,9065,"""Ultimate rod/reel combo""  No such thing!"
734898,Ainsley,2012-10-06 20:37:00,142,I'd have to keep my dobyns champion extreme 744c with the shimano Antares AR. great combo that I usually use for jigs and spinnerbaits but handles most baits quite well.
734921,northernpike56,2012-10-06 22:43:00,717,"7'0 MH st. croix avid I guess. Paired with my saros 2500. I can think of a lot nicer equipment out there that I'd like to say I would want to keep, but those two things are the nicest that I own."
734946,nlpaintballer,2012-10-07 00:48:00,122,"My ultimate setup is a St. Croix 7' XHF and a CI4 4000 spooled with 40 pound PP. I use it 95% of the time while fishing for pike, bass and muskie. Great for multi species fishing where you might run into some big fish and don't want to wear out the fish or be broken off."
734955,mercman,2012-10-07 01:46:00,7054, So just pretend then Dax We'll let you keep one combo for each species then.
734961,Gregoire,2012-10-07 01:56:00,1397,"If I were to add a bass combo I have a 6""3"" loomis bornzeback rod and a 1000 series stradic that I just love. I use it for everything from senko to small crakbaits, and find that it even has the power to pull fish out from under docks."
735035,GBW,2012-10-07 14:58:00,8460,so did u get a new one after trying my drop shot rod and FJ last year?
735042,Acountdeleted,2012-10-07 16:35:00,2562,"My 5'6 Ugly Stick Lite with my Pfluger President reel. Sure it costs half as much as my 6'0 Medium St.Croix with my Rapala R-type on it, but I think my grandmother must have blessed that rod when she bought it for me for christmas 7 years ago. I've caught more fish with that combo then I've had good days."
735090,Jigger,2012-10-07 22:54:00,1237," If i didnt spend so much on Senkos and Slammers, not to mention worm hooks/dropshot hooks and weights, id probably have another combo just like it! Maybe two!"
735108,NAW,2012-10-08 00:33:00,4022,"I don'y have any nice expensive combos! So if my boat was sinking, I'd be twirling those wing nuts on the 9.9 trying to save something worth a few bucks"
735123,mercman,2012-10-08 01:49:00,7054,   I have to stop reading your posts with liquid of any kind in my mouth !!!
