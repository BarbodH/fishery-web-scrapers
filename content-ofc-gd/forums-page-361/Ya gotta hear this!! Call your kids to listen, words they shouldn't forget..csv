734615,Terry,2012-10-05 10:12:00,14456,"  and that is why I watched the first part of it and thought it was taken from other peoples work..  and while it may be well done, someone else was first so this is just a paridy"

734671,quickme,2012-10-05 15:33:00,261,AMAZING!!  i feel guilty for not bringing my kids out more.  I know its much easier to stick the kids infront of the TV to unwind but this is not how I was raised and its about damn time I changed that.  thank you for letting me realize that i'm being selfish and not putting my kids first.

And I'm very thankful my children understood this message.  Amazingly done doesn't do it justice  If I was making decisions at OFC (or any outdoors channel), I'd be all over this"
639438,Miracon,2011-11-11 23:32:00,200,WOW! I know it's been said...but WOW! That should be shown in schools at a Primary Level. Things like that stick in kids' minds. It really could make a difference. Awesome job! Thanks for sharing Randy!
639448,Fisherman,2011-11-12 00:49:00,7201,"That's a fine piece of work, congratulations.  Now hopefully we can hear that on some of the fishing shows instead of the hee hee haw haw cave man sounds that come out of some of those fishing show hosts."

639485,Skud,2011-11-12 04:10:00,739,I could only get half way through. It was getting to negative for me. Bleh!
639503,Nipfisher,2011-11-12 13:50:00,2449,Ya 1st go through is negative. In reverse it it positive. That is the point of it. Listen to it again or skip to the seccond half.
640066,Muskieman,2011-11-14 21:07:00,2472,BUMP.......  that little envelope should be on fire...

673247,Big Cliff,2012-03-05 15:58:00,6899,I'd like to see someone like wild TV air it. Anyone thought about sending it to Brice Folden? How about OFAH it would be perfect for them too! This is a beautiful message and needs to be heard by as many people as will listen to it!
673453,Muskieman,2012-03-06 03:40:00,2472,I really can't understand why this isn't getting more attention.  It's friggin awesome !
