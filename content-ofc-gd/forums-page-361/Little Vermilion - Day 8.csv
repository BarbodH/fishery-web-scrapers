735633,Joey,2012-10-10 17:29:00,9122,"OMG Connie, that does not look like fun, well unless you have a snowmobile"
735637,4x4bassin,2012-10-10 17:36:00,1025,"Ouch ! That is what you call a ""cold front"" Hope you are making the best of it"
735638,fishnsled,2012-10-10 17:38:00,3520,"No words required, pictures say it all. Looks like a great day to stay inside, unless you want to shovel out the boat.  Or as Joey said, get the sled all gassed up and go for a ride.  Not what you were hoping for weather wise I'm sure. I'll pass on that weather for a couple of months at least."
735644,Rich Clemens,2012-10-10 17:53:00,3131,"Kinda looks like Tennesee No worries, that stuff will be coming our way before we know it."
735645,Roy,2012-10-10 17:55:00,13728,"Doesn't seem to be affecting you much, Connie. Deadstickin' through the ice should get you a few good sized esox. Thanks for the update. I hope the weather clears out for you."
735648,irishfield,2012-10-10 17:59:00,26272,Hunters will be happy.. they can follow the tracks! Brett on the other hand... unless you're brooming the snow of that Dehaviland!!
735652,Harrison,2012-10-10 18:40:00,2202,"Looks like your ""stuck"" there for a bit longer... gosh darn it huh."
735654,NAW,2012-10-10 19:02:00,4022,"I'm assuming this is the Little Verimillion lake in northen Ontario?  That should get a few more ducks on the move, heading my way!  Thanks for posting the pictures.  I alway enjoy this time of year.  A few more weeks and Drifter will be doing some ice riding!"
735656,TennesseeGuy,2012-10-10 19:14:00,957,"I'm in Tennessee, after arriving home at 1:00 a.m. yesterday morning.  Late Saturday afternoon I hitched a flight out of camp, but not to where my van was waiting for me.  A truck ride got me to my van.  Wayne, I was amazed and impressed with the cooperation among pilots and plane owners in coordinating their efforts to pick up hunters from outpost camps.  No float plane went anywhere without a load.  Fuel stashes were shared when extra runs needed to be made.  I would have stayed another week with a hint of decent fishing conditions."

735812,solopaddler,2012-10-11 12:09:00,8605,"Wow, I'm not even close to being ready for anything like that."
