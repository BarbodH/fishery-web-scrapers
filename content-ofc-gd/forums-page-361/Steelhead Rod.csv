For my new rod I need something about 11' and not too whippy for spinning tackle. Anyone know any good rods like this in the price range of $70-$110? My local shops don't seem to be carrying too many. Thanks"
735738,Bondar,2012-10-10 23:24:00,817,"Personally I'd probably look at a fenwick , might be a little more. Than 110. Decent rod for the money , other than that maybe shimano convergence or  rapala  ?"
735755,Ralph Field,2012-10-11 00:37:00,1018,Streamside or Shimano clarus  would be in your price range.

735762,solopaddler,2012-10-11 00:51:00,8605,Streamside rods are actually pretty nice sticks for the money.
