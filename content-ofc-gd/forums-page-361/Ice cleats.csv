734251,crappieperchhunter,2012-10-03 19:57:00,2582,Lew I just screw hex head screws into the bottom of my boot. I know you mentioned you don't wanna do this. However I felt I should mention that I had icers and the straps wore through the heel of the rubber coated winter boot I used to use for ice fishing...making them none waterproof and therefore useless for any outdoor activity in the rain or cold.  That is why I ended up going the hex head screw route. Most will never ever put the miles or the wear & tear on there boots that I have in the past put I felt I should mention this for anybody thinking of using any type of strap on cleats.
734256,lew,2012-10-03 20:08:00,12766,"Thanks cuzza, better the straps are too long rather than too short as that'd be an easy fix.  And CPH, you make a good point but I certainly won't be putting on the miles you do, I only do about 1 1/2 miles each morning and the cleats will only be used the odd time the road is ice covered....which was actually quite often last year with all the freezing & melting we had going on."
734261,Sinker,2012-10-03 20:27:00,8692,"I haven't had an issue with the straps at all,  Lew. I find they work great on everything from my hikers, to waders, to my great big size 14 baffins. Never had them come off, or become uncomfortable. They do add a substantial amount of extra weight to your boots, though. I've had mine for 4 or 5 seasons now with no issues at all,  and I put lots of miles on them too. I wear them at work when its slick as well."
734267,lew,2012-10-03 20:57:00,12766,"OK, thanks Shane, I think I've decided on the HT's after all the positive remarks about them."
734268,adempsey,2012-10-03 21:00:00,1498,"  Same experience.  I have Baffins as well and use the HT brand.  They work, but man are they HEAVY....especially when you walk out on the ice dragging all your gear behind you.  I'd check out the Lee Valley ones (or others) first to see if they are lighter."
734276,darsky,2012-10-03 21:45:00,586,Lew-I sell these.  What are CTC asking ?  link to product  http://amgmedical.com/site/our_products_results.asp?trouv1=735-170
734278,gaspumper,2012-10-03 21:52:00,393,I have had the ones from CTC for 2 years now no problems with them at all.They do go on sale for $19.99 once in a while.I paid $29.99 for mine.
734292,lew,2012-10-03 22:35:00,12766, They look similar to the ones in my original post that are sold in LeBarons darsky. If I remember correctly I think they were around $17 but I've looked at so many today the numbers are all starting to run together
734834,TroutnMuskieHunter,2012-10-06 13:47:00,1362," Hi Lew,  I've been using the HT cleat sandals for a couple of years now and I love them!!..no issues with the straps at all."
735032,pike slayer,2012-10-07 14:34:00,1177,http://www.overshoe.com/Pages/Product.aspx?category=STABILicers%C2%AE&cat=HLS-OVERSHOE&pid=N5P3S  bessst boots ever! i've had these for 3 years and havent failed me yet. i show up to the lake in my favourite comfy running shoes and i slip these on. sooo light and comfy! feels like all im wearing is my favourite running shoes and they are warm!! ive been out in the -30s with warm feet. and they have removable studs for the slick ice.
735047,ziekertail,2012-10-07 16:42:00,5,"I have the ht spikes and they work great I use them on my Baffin boots and the Velcro fits perfect , I tried the machine screws before it works ok but the screws rip out of most boots under strain think they cost me 30 a few years ago and I think they are well worth the money"
735055,NANUK,2012-10-07 17:58:00,797,"I work outside a lot of times during winter, after trying several types of ice cleats I find ""GRIPONS"" work best for me, They are made out of carbide steel and dig in the ice as soon as you start to slip, they don't wear out as easy as regular steel spikes and are rust proof, you can order replacement studs if needed as well ."
735114,jace,2012-10-08 00:56:00,472,spikes if you're walking mostly flat terrain.   wider bar cleat style if you do a lot of walking up/down iced inclines.  spikes tend to bend over in whatever the retaining material is where wide bar cleats remain dug in and stable under your foot.
734169,lew,2012-10-03 14:39:00,12766,"I bought a couple sets of ice cleats from CTC last year but they don't work well and am looking for something better for this coming winter. I found these on the LeBaron website catalogue and wondered if anyone has used them and are they any good.  Their not for frozen lakes, but more for when the Mrs. and I go for daily hikes along ice covered dirt roads.  Any thoughts ??  "
734170,misfish,2012-10-03 14:44:00,29133," Ya right,,,,,,,,,,,,,    I cant see the pic Lew,but I like the ones Terry uses. Maybe he can post a pic of them."
734172,kemper,2012-10-03 14:47:00,2232,"What about putting spikes into the bottom of your hiking boots? Simms makes some excellent ones, if you can ignore that they are outrageously overpriced."
734173,BillM,2012-10-03 14:48:00,17367, Sheet metal screws from Canadian Tire are cheaper and work just as good.   I've got a bunch of them on my G4's.
734174,lew,2012-10-03 15:05:00,12766,"Yeah, I've heard of guys putting screws in their boots, but Id prefer a decent strap-on instead.  Thanks for the suggestion though.  And NO Brian, there's no ice fishing in my future"
734175,4x4bassin,2012-10-03 15:06:00,1025,"I work outside on the ramp at Pearson and have been slippin and slidin for years on that icy ramp untill I purchased these things called Yaktrax , never a problem with traction . Check them out Lew , highly recomended . O ya I have had my pair for several years now with no durability issues"

734182,16 Footer,2012-10-03 15:27:00,191,"Get a pair of Microspikes made by Kahtoola from MEC, $55 last year. They don't fall off and have great grip on ice. Most of the people I hike with wear them in winter."
734187,lew,2012-10-03 15:46:00,12766,"Thanks boys, I checked the Yaktrax website and it turns out there's several dealers close-by so I'll have a look at them next time I go to town.  If they don't work out, I'll have a look at the ones from MEC"
734190,Slop,2012-10-03 15:52:00,151,Alot of my buddies use Yaktrax but find they have to replace them every few seasons....too much ice time perhaps?  I've had a pair of Icers for the last six years and they still look like they just came outta the box. The Vibram sole is bulletproof!  http://www.icers.nb.ca/
734194,lew,2012-10-03 15:56:00,12766,"Thanks Slop, they look good too and I'll add them to my search list."
734198,Fisherman,2012-10-03 16:13:00,7201,"Check with Lee Valley Tools of all places, they carry the same ones that Canada Post uses.   Here: http://www.leevalley.com/en/home/Search.aspx?action=n"
734200,fishnsled,2012-10-03 16:19:00,3520,"X 2 on the icers.  I have what is most likely their original model and still using them for about well over 12 years now, could be 15+ years. I know 12 as I've been divorced for that long and they were a gift from the ex.  Personally I wouldn't use anything else. I've had a couple of the pull on ones and the just kept coming off. The Velcro straps work really well and easy to take on and off.  You can get them at Lee Valley Tools.  Icers  HT Enterprises has something very similar at Canadian Tire.  Super Stud Sandals   Edit - Not familiar with the ones in the picture Lew."
734207,kickingfrog,2012-10-03 16:47:00,8333,"I think for most people and most conditions multiple smaller ""spikes"" is better then the bigger aggressive spikes/teeth. The smaller spikes require less pressure to grip and you are less likely to catch them on the ground while swinging your leg forward. The toe and heal coverage is often better with small spikes so you have contact at the heal strike phase as well as the toe push-off."
734214,cuzza,2012-10-03 17:19:00,467, I have these and they're very good - have used them for icefishing and hiking with no problems and no sliding around.
734220,ch312,2012-10-03 17:34:00,1590,"longer spikes are best if there is any snow on the ice. many of the cleats with smaller spikes are useless when there is a skiff of snow on the ice as the spikes simply can't reach the ice. this is the most dangerous time as the thin layer of snow between the ice and your boot makes it even more slippery than plain ice.  i'm not sure which brand these are, but i've been using them for years without a hint of slippage on any surface. no worries of tripping up if you walk properly and don't drag your feet. they're very comfortable for long walks as the steel spreads the load over most of the sole of your boot rather than walking on ""bumps"" like those pictured. mine aren't even noticeable while other brands i've tried were horrible for walking.  plus, you can literally run across downed logs with no worries of slipping  "
734226,SylvanOwner,2012-10-03 17:57:00,266,"x3 on Icers - they're excellent.  The ""HT knock-offs"" look good as well and are not only a little cheaper but likely more readily available to you, being that CT sells 'em.  Well worth the investment either way.  Be safe."
734227,Sinker,2012-10-03 18:08:00,8692,"Another vote for the HT ice sandals. They do work well, and are quite comfy. Maybe a little heavy, but they're effective for sure. I would tighten all the studs on a regular basis, or you will lose some. HT send me a new package of them for free though, so its all good  S."
734229,lew,2012-10-03 18:22:00,12766,"I went to the CTC site and looked at those HT cleats and they look great, but reading the couple reviews available it sounds like there's a problem with the velcro straps not fitting too well.  Any of you HT users have a problem with the straps ??"
734238,Terry,2012-10-03 18:45:00,14456,   Icer's are what I have
734240,fishnsled,2012-10-03 18:50:00,3520, Can't speak for those HT ones but my Icers needed to have the straps extended when I went to a heavier boot. Were fine with my hiking style boots and the -40 rubber ones but when I went to a -100 they didn't fit. Had the misses sew on an extension for the velcro and all is good. Not sure it you would need to do that with the new ones or not.
734245,lew,2012-10-03 19:20:00,12766,"OK thanks again everyone, time to do some shopping around."
734247,kickingfrog,2012-10-03 19:28:00,8333,Too bad you couldn't borrow a bunch of brands and rent the local rink and try them out before buying.
734248,cuzza,2012-10-03 19:29:00,467, I needed to trim the straps as they were too long - I wear them over a regular hiking type boot rather than really big heavy winter boots.
