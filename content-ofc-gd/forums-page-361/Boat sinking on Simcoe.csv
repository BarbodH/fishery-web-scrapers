735221,Dutch,2012-10-08 16:11:00,831,Out in a 16 footer.  Was it windy out there yesterday?
735224,Luke V.,2012-10-08 16:20:00,286,It was windy down here (niagara region) yesterday
735226,Roy,2012-10-08 16:47:00,13728,And a healthy portion of gratitude to the private pilot who not only spotted the disabled vessel but was able to transmit the exact location to the authorities.
735227,Luke V.,2012-10-08 17:03:00,286,Roy you got it! Cudos to him!!!
735228,Christopheraaron,2012-10-08 17:17:00,3525, Another good guy!
735230,ttahhan,2012-10-08 17:23:00,191,"Lucky guy ! Cudos to the private pilot for noticing and reacting by calling the authorities....putting it out there... IF ITS WINDY STAY OFF SIMCOE...Simply not worth it, that lake for some reason can change from almost mirror lake to a swell breading monster...Be Safe Check, The Weather before going out......"
735232,davey buoy,2012-10-08 17:26:00,5505, Have seen it many times over the last 25 years. Sure can get scary in no time.
735286,d_paluch,2012-10-08 23:49:00,343,"Was at the cottage on Fox Island this weekend. Friday was nice, a little choppy, but nice. Saturday was absolutely crazy. Had to pick up some people for the Thanksgiving dinner and really should not have been out on the water, and this is in a 19"" bowrider. I saw a guy on a ~15 footer out there near Snake Island...wonder if it was him?  This is my first year on Simcoe, and still don't know the lake well (got the cottage Aug1. and only been there on weekends). We got into some large swells, easily 6foot on Saturday...  Thankfully all that happened was I got wet, lesson learned that day that's forsure.  Stay safe"
735323,krixxer,2012-10-09 02:10:00,274,"I like fishing around Fox, was out on sunday but I guess it was calmed down by the time I got out."
735326,irishfield,2012-10-09 02:12:00,26272,"The main part of the story is ""engine trouble"". Most any boat can be transom swamped (or rolled) in swells without power to keep it moving forward. Kudos to the eye in the sky that got him picked up."
