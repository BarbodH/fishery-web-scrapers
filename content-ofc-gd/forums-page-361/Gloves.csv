731239,Dan668,2012-09-19 23:38:00,1120,"Anyone have a  recommendation on a pair they like to use for fall/winter fishing? I hate wearing gloves, especially when using a baitcaster come November but than my hands freeze quick.  Thanks"
731242,adolson,2012-09-19 23:54:00,783,"I'm very interested in the answer to this as well. Last year I had to quit early because I can't seem to cast very well wearing gloves and couldn't find a good pair around here. And it seems it's getting colder faster this year, or my memory isn't what it used to be, or my memory isn't what it used to be."
731243,GBW,2012-09-19 23:57:00,8460,"auto mechanic gloves work and some come with an exposed finger(s) and thumb.  if the thumb isn't open, cut the tip off the one you need to thumb the line with if you don't feel it like you want to.  I keep 2 sets of them with me fall fishing incase I need to change a wet glove."
731245,BucktownAngler,2012-09-20 00:02:00,582,"these are the gloves i use. (might not be warm enough for winter, but great for fall)  they are neoprene BPS gloves, and are fairly cheap  you can pull back the index finger and thumb to tie knots, etc. without having to remove the gloves  also works for baitcasting, just pull the thumb back.    FYI, it says its waterproof....It is NOT but stilll good for the money"
731246,BillM,2012-09-20 00:11:00,17367,"I've got the Simms Windstopper fold over mitt for steelhead fishing, they work awesome.  Although if it's really REALLY cold, I've got some rag wool/alpaca mitts that keep me warm even if they're soaking wet."
731248,Snidley,2012-09-20 00:19:00,620,I used to use Patagonia climbing gloves which were excellent. I can't find them anywhere anymore however. Now I go to the dollar store and buy the heavier fleece gloves for $1-$2. If you need fingers bare snip of the tip of the fingers and way you go.
731251,backbay,2012-09-20 00:31:00,773,I use the Thinsulate mits that fold back and attach by Velcro to let you use your fingers when you need 'em
731252,Burtess,2012-09-20 00:33:00,901,Rag wool fingerless gloves or the BPS Windriver fleece fingerless gloves with a hotshot stuck in the palm.  That keeps the blood flowing to the exposed fingers.  Burt
731253,GBW,2012-09-20 00:33:00,8460,"but the key with a baitcaster is your thumb.  I too have the fold back mit's/gloves and never use them when using a baitcaster.  not enough feel in the thumb with them.  any other type of reel, for sure they are good."

731289,mike rousseau,2012-09-20 02:24:00,4661,Don't cast...lol
731296,backbay,2012-09-20 02:44:00,773," I hear what you're saying, but i seem to get away with them ok.... and like Mike says, when it's really cold, I'll tend to troll!"
731301,adolson,2012-09-20 03:31:00,783,"Seems like everyone uses something different, haha. I like the look of those neoprene gloves w/ the finger slits. I'll try and find some of them in Sudbury.   lol  Some days, the trout seem to only bite casting or still-fishing."
731381,NAW,2012-09-20 16:18:00,4022,"Fall fishing = NO gloves.  This time of the year is used to condition my fingers for the up coming ice fishing season.  If my hands get to cold, I take a break for a few minutes, and warm them up in my pockets.."
735075,Sour_Squirrel,2012-10-07 20:34:00,196,"I wear nitrile gloves underneath fleece gloves the have the flip up fingers.  The nitrile gloves keep my hands dry and thus, relatively warm. If my hands get wet they get cold no matter what type of gloves I'm wearing."
735193,EC1,2012-10-08 14:14:00,930,"Up until the point where it gets cold enough to need actual insulation in the glove, I find white work gloves are fantastic. Just takes the bite out of the wind, and does not affect manual dexterity too badly.  Once the real gloves are needed, I just have a bunch of gloves with thinsulate in them. Not much you can do about it. Any glove will hinder your touch etc."
735237,sauce,2012-10-08 17:41:00,219,Try bringing 2 pairs of fingerless cotton or wool gloves. Keep a pair tucked inside your sweater and swap them back and forth once the first pair gets damp. Also remember to keep a towel handy to dry your hands. Dry hands and a warm spare set is about all you should need.
735253,ketchenany,2012-10-08 19:34:00,3229,  Glad  you have more tha one pair. I recall a few years back you forgot them at home while fishing with Solo!
735303,Joeytier,2012-10-09 00:48:00,3990,"Bingo.  It's funny how we bundle up in semi-cold fall conditions, but when the same temps roll around in April everybody is frolicking around in t-shirts"
735348,azebra,2012-10-09 10:17:00,168,"I'd have to agree, this time of year as much as I like the warmth of my  long johns and gloves I won't do it unless its bitter bitter cold out.  Why get comfy with your winter gear now when it's not even winter yet?! The long johns wont get cracked until the thermostat reads - 10"
735374,tknohpy,2012-10-09 13:53:00,162,under armour make some good ones available at bass pro...liner gloves i think they are called
735403,mepps,2012-10-09 15:25:00,1301,"I've been using Glacier Gloves and I love em. They look like the BPS gloves listed earlier. I have the pair with the thumb and Index finger cut outs, so they are of course NOT waterproof."
735404,manitoubass2,2012-10-09 15:29:00,11391,"I'm all about mechanic gloves. I usually just get the normal style and clip off the thumb and finger. It's the only way I've found to still be able to do everything you need to do unimpeded.  I wear them ice fishing too, and when I need to warm the hands (if I'm not in the shack) I just deadstick for a few minutes and put a pair of warm mitts on right over top"
735405,Harrison,2012-10-09 15:29:00,2202,"Wool, fingerless gloves.  then  Wool Mitts."
