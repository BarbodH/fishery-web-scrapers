735153,Sour_Squirrel,2012-10-08 11:33:00,196,I'm planning my weekend fishing getaway already. I'll just be going for the day to either Gull Lake up by Gravenhurst or Port Severn. I haven't been to either and was wondering if anyone can tell me anything about either place. I've driven past Gull  Lake many times on my way up to Lake of Bays and the narrows area of the lake looks real nice. What I'd really like to know is any fishing reports in either area and more importantly where can I launch and park?  I don't mind paying for a decent ramp and a decent safe area to park.
