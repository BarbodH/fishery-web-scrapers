735052,tb4me,2012-10-07 17:34:00,3295,Awesome..I would gladly for just about any other race but Dega has the cat beat hands down.. Go Blue Deuce baby!
735053,Terry,2012-10-07 17:49:00,14456,record it
735054,tb4me,2012-10-07 17:57:00,3295,"Terry great idea....However this is a soft spot for me big time..I bought a LG PVR for that purpose only....Now for some reason, since upgrading to HD it will only record for about 2 hours then I get a thing that pops up that says record blocking signals detected...Then the screen goes black....LG wont do anything about it..Says its my shaw provider...."
735056,Terry,2012-10-07 18:09:00,14456, that sucks   can you do a manual record and set it to record it in 1.5 hour segments
735057,davey buoy,2012-10-07 18:12:00,5505, Wonder why it let's you go to the 2 hour mark?.
735058,tb4me,2012-10-07 18:34:00,3295,I called shaw about it..They say its a signal TSN puts out that gets picked up by certian recivers I happen to own one of them..
735059,tb4me,2012-10-07 18:44:00,3295,if anyone else is interested..Heres the link.. Streams 2 3 or 4 will work..  www.fstreaming96.blogspot.de
735084,i2cool2fool,2012-10-07 21:52:00,349,I listened to the race using my Sirius iPhone app and watched the last 5 laps on TSN.  Wow. Quite the finish.
