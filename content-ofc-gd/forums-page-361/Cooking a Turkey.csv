735361,ch312,2012-10-09 12:29:00,1590,i need my grandmother to read this site to put and end to the slices of turkey flavored sawdust that's barely edible with a gallon of gravy. she must cook those suckers til the internal temp of the bird is 250 before slicing the breasts an hour before dinner time to make sure every last drop of moisture is sucked out of the meat.
735365,SirCranksalot,2012-10-09 13:08:00,3291,"Well, you could (a) direct her to this site and possibly risk being cut out of her will, or ( be a good boy and grin and bear it and tell your nan what a nice turkey.. If you choose (a) let us know how it works out for you, willya??"
735411,Headhunter,2012-10-09 15:45:00,5703,"  Was at my MIL for turkey dinner... she put a 15lb turkey in the oven at 10:00am and served it to us at 6:00pm... a very unique sound when gravy was applied... very much like the sound of water being pulled down a large drain... and to make matters worse, she ALWAYS throws out the neck and gibblets, which are the only edible parts of the bird as far as I'm concerned! Normally, I do the bird, but this year, she said she wanted to do it... and she's always amazed when I tell her the bird was completely cooked in just over 2 1/2 hours... So now I have half a desert turkey in my fridge as she insisted that I take it home to make soup and turkey tettrazini (sp). On the bright side, it has absorbed all of the ice build up in my spare fridge, craving moisture! LOL HH"
735412,jedimaster,2012-10-09 16:07:00,3472,"breast up and don't fully cook it in the oven, pull it a bit early, wrap it in  tin foil and put it in a cooler to finish cooking.. Comes out awesome."
735413,SirCranksalot,2012-10-09 16:12:00,3291,    Threw out the neck!! Have some pity on her. She must have dementia! Could you savw some for me. I need some dessicant for my camera and electronics!   
735416,woodenboater,2012-10-09 16:23:00,2277,"What, no love for turkey livers ? Wife doesn't go for offal so all the more for me"
735423,Headhunter,2012-10-09 16:52:00,5703,You make a good point! Maybe I should save some of that bird for when I drop some electronics in the water... I could use the turkey instead of rice! HH
735449,Sour_Squirrel,2012-10-09 20:11:00,196,  Another  piece of the bird that's overlooked are the wing tips. Done right (crispy) they're so tasty!! 
735450,davey buoy,2012-10-09 20:16:00,5505, They say the meat is always sweeter closer to the bone!!!
735474,Pangle,2012-10-09 22:27:00,64,"  Agreed!  Take the time to brine it overnight and you will have a moist bird. I make my brine a little less salty than most to prevent the pan gravy becoming too salty. I place the turkey in a 20L pail frozen and cover it with brine and leave it in the garage overnight (covered).  By the morning it is still very cold but thawed.  Pat dry, rub sage, thyme and butter under the skin and cook at 300 F.  Turn up the heat the last 30 min to crisp skin."
735150,Sour_Squirrel,2012-10-08 11:22:00,196,Going to be cooking a turkey later today. Is it better to cook it with the breast side up or breaast side down??  Have a great Thanksgiving to all.....
735151,lakerguy,2012-10-08 11:24:00,224,Breast up
735152,Terry,2012-10-08 11:28:00,14456,a great chef told me breast down and flip it the last hour to brown it
735162,Fish Farmer,2012-10-08 12:22:00,2234,"Breast down if you do care about the presentation, white meat nice and moist. Best part is the neck if someone doesn't, beat you to it   But the best turkey I have ever had was a deep fried, the down side is no gravy and dressing."
735164,Christopheraaron,2012-10-08 12:25:00,3525,Down.
735165,Live2fish85,2012-10-08 12:25:00,1633,Breast down all the way. As Terry said turn it over the last hour uncovered to get the skin crispy and brown. So much better when the white meat isn't like chewing a piece of jerky haha.
735166,davey buoy,2012-10-08 12:27:00,5505," Deep fried,3mins a pound!,,mmmmm."
735167,Gregoire,2012-10-08 12:28:00,1397,Grill it up on indirect heat in a pan. Put a rub on the turkey to make the skin brown perfectly.
735170,woodenboater,2012-10-08 12:32:00,2277,"Breast up but tent it with foil for most of the process. Also foil the wing tips and legs. Pull tent last half hour or so for golden, browny goodness . We usually stuff sage under the skin at the breast and bird goes on a rack as well."
735171,Fish Farmer,2012-10-08 12:35:00,2234,"Now that sounds good, do you put it in the gas BBQ or Charcoal?"
735173,Live2fish85,2012-10-08 12:38:00,1633,"  My parents and I cooked a smaller turkey on there gas BBQ, we did it on the rotisserie and it was amazing. Also took a case of beer to be finished but was even better then."
735176,Sour_Squirrel,2012-10-08 13:05:00,196,"OK, it seems for a turkey cooked with juicy moist white meat to cook breast side down and flip over for the last hour or so. I'm thinking of cooking at 325 *F to start but when I flip it (breast side up) do I still cook it at the same temp or do I need to increase the temp to brown and crisp the skin?	If so, what temp?  btw. yes, the neck (cooked crisp) is the best part for knawing on!!"
735178,Live2fish85,2012-10-08 13:11:00,1633,"I don't know about everyone else but I usually cook my turkey or roast a bit higher to start. Usually a half hour to a hour, depending on the size. I find it helps keep the juices in the meat.  Yes the neck is the best part. Luckily my grandfather and I are the only ones that like it. One thing I hate is the gizards lol. I thought I was being sneaky yesterday eating some of the stuffing while carving the bird and I got the heart and I really dont like them haha."
735189,Gregoire,2012-10-08 13:59:00,1397,"I use a natural gas grill. It is just like cooking it in the oven, but the grill gives it extra flavour. The rub goes on and under the skin, with makes the bird caramelize nicely. I am in the process of preparing the bird right now. It just came out of the brine and I am making the stuffing now.  The advantages of natural gas grills make the process a lot easier."
735198,captpierre,2012-10-08 14:33:00,2521,"Cooked a lot of turkeys.  It's always my job.  The key is not to overcook.  Make sure the bird is fully thawed.  If not, put in a sink filled with warm water.   Dry.  Salt/white pepper/ paprika(for colour) -I like to make a thin paste with cooking oil and rub in on everywhere.  Cover with foil.  Breast side up.   325 degrees.  Use a thermometer.  Stick it into the thickest part of the thigh.  Take foil off the last 30 -45 min.  Take out when thermometer says 185 degrees and leave to rest on the counter covered in foil for 15-30 min depending on the size.  The rest redistributes the juices.  Heat will still penetrate deeper to get to the desired safe 190 degrees.  I cut the entire breasts off both sides of the carcass, lay flat on a cutting board and slice into 1/4 inch beautiful slices.  Keep the slices together and lay on your turkey tray/plate.  I leave the drumsticks whole for looks and debone the thighs for dark meat.  Easy to serve.  White meat is moist and still hot.  Goodluck"
735200,davey buoy,2012-10-08 14:37:00,5505," I think that is the most common way.That's the way my grandparents,parents,in laws and wife does it. Always moist!"
735206,SirCranksalot,2012-10-08 14:51:00,3291,"  I'd fight you for it!!  I've tasted them done either way and, as long as someone else does it, it tastes great!!!  "
735207,Twocoda,2012-10-08 14:53:00,4130,We always BBQ our turkeys but tried something different yesterday...instead of one huge bird on the rotiserie we used two smaller 10 pound birds...one on the BBQ rotiserie and one in the deep fryer...both turned out amazing ! special trip home for turkey sandwiches and then back to the river...
735208,crappieperchhunter,2012-10-08 14:59:00,2582,"Up, down... is completely unimportant. Get a digital meat thermometer and cook to the recommended temperature.  It will always be perfect and moist. That goes for pork and beef roasts as well. Cooked for a lot of years without a meat thermometer and finally caved in an got one 4-5 years ago. Have not had a over cooked bird or roast since. Cooking wise it will be the best $20 you ever spent."
735209,captpierre,2012-10-08 15:16:00,2521,"Ya, but you could buy a 10 inch  Believer for that"
735212,misfish,2012-10-08 15:27:00,29133," Right on brother.  We went down to Highland farms after work yesterday. They have turkey necks that could feed a family of 4. What the hell are they feeding these things? Bought a drum leg,that was the size of my,,,,,,,,,,,,,, forearm. That,s the only bit of bird for us. Just back from work,and the mrs,s has the boiled dinner  well on it,s  way."
735213,crappieperchhunter,2012-10-08 15:39:00,2582,LOL  I don't fish for those big boys. But that same $20 would pretty much buy all my panfish plastics  for an entire season
735215,Gregoire,2012-10-08 15:55:00,1397,"My neigbour was just over and was sharing a cookbook where they try multiple different cooking techniques and apparently the best way to cook a turkey is to start with the breast down and then turn it over, as this ensures that the meat is evenly cooked. My Turkey is on the grill right now breast down. It will stay there for 3 hours, at which point it will be turned. I will also be basting it every half hour or so. It is covered in a rub, and the sausage, giblet and scallop stuffing will be cooked seperately in the over. I'll let you guys know how it turns out."
735218,Dutch,2012-10-08 16:04:00,831," I agree with everything here except the temperature,  I cook until the internal temp of the thigh is 165.  A turkey can easily rest for 30-60 minutes and the temp will continue to increase over that time if it is tented. Make sure to let it rest at least 30 minutes.  Breast up/breast down makes no difference.  The juices in the bird don't migrate due to gravity, the muscle is not permeable like that.  If you want a real juicy turkey, brine it, but that is some what advanced, save it for next time.  NEVER use the old 1/2 hour per pound thing.  I ate dry, tasteless turkey doused in gravy until I started cooking my own.  The only accurate wast to tell doneness is with a thermometer."
735352,fish_fishburn,2012-10-09 11:38:00,1311,"Up or down doesnt matter, its all about the brine."
