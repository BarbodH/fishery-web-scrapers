I went out maybe mid month and temp outside was around 12 degrees, light drizzle, I was looking for Bass, but most of my spots are shallow river (0-6 ft) so it seems that shallow water cools quickly and bass move deeper I think?  Anyway, in searching for Bass with little gold minnow crankbaits (live target), I hit something, didn't even know what it was, up and down stream, 20 min battle. Couldn't believe it when I saw it was a beautiful trout, perhaps 4-5lb. I thought Bass could fight, they have nothing on these boys.  So I was wondering what type of water temps do trout start to run up rivers, shallow fast currents, never caught one there in summer ever, but have in Oct. Last year I didn't time it right and didn't get into any. Would like to have an idea because I don't seem to catch anything else there in Oct, like Walleye etc."
