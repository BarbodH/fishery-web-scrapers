735338,limeyangler,2012-10-09 03:01:00,5204,"  Agreed. At the same time they can charge what they want i guess, which makes me wonder how all the 5 gas stations here in our 'city' keep their prices the same and rise or fall at the same time....price fixing? oh wait...thats illegal and the goverment says it does not happen...i believe it if the government says it."
735414,GreenCanada,2012-10-09 16:15:00,375," Fossil fuels are finite resources. It may take awhile for us to run out, but it will happen eventually. Well, that is if we don't destroy the planet first. We should be paying the true cost of burning these types of fuels and by not including the environmental cost of fossil fuels we are paying far less than we should be.  I hate the fact that gas prices are pretty damaging to our pocket books, especially the volatility. Through a societal shift in our thinking/behaviour we would be better able to invest and focus our energy into the harnessing of other cleaner technologies to run our transportation systems.  I'm not about to get into a larger debate about climate change and the like as I doubt it would be well received by a few members here.  Personally, I think the government needs to start laying many more price fixing charges against the various oil companies/gas stations."
735438,davey buoy,2012-10-09 19:08:00,5505,"I heard ,just saying,there is so much oil that they know of untapped,but why pay the extra now ?So they can charge what they want. I believe myself it is a unregulated price for gas and a tax grab. IMO. No disrespect intended."
734617,ketchenany,2012-10-05 11:05:00,3229,"Just heard that tonight price may increase, so if you are traveling do it today if you can."
734619,bushart,2012-10-05 11:13:00,2628,I guess the cat had kittens again---jack the price
734625,lew,2012-10-05 12:12:00,12766,I left home last Friday for a fish'n trip and gas was $1.17 and when I got back home 2 days later it was up to $1.24  Nothings surprising anymore.
734626,Luke V.,2012-10-05 12:14:00,286,Lew. 1.24 is considered cheap here. I paid 132 yesterday and saw as high as 135. Will see what they jack it too.
734627,lew,2012-10-05 12:21:00,12766," I agree Luke, it is cheaper than alot of areas, but it's still maddening when it jumps 8-10 cents over night but takes 2 weeks to go down the same amount."
734628,BillM,2012-10-05 12:23:00,17367,I think the only thing to do now is buy stock in the gas companies..  There's a reason why they post multi-billion profits each year.
734629,jedimaster,2012-10-05 12:35:00,3472,I love it when I see a gas stations in one town 10 cents or more cheaper than in another city or town only a half hour away from eachother.
734638,Luke V.,2012-10-05 13:14:00,286,Lew I understand completely. It jumps 8 cents takes a week to go down 4 and then jump 8 cents again
734639,Sour_Squirrel,2012-10-05 13:23:00,196,It's not really the gas companies' fault.	The main culprit is the government!!
734640,mercman,2012-10-05 13:24:00,7054,"  Lew...I'll see your 1.24 and raise ya 1.49 Such a rip off. Oh well its ""Thanksgiving"""

Dont be fooled we have more than enough oil around the globe.....we are not going to run out...Its unfortunate human nature...""GREED"""
