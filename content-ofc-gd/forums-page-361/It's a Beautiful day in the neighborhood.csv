735097,Whitespinnerbait,2012-10-07 23:44:00,2038,  In the Gatineau Hills
735098,Live2fish85,2012-10-07 23:52:00,1633,Awesome picture.
735107,NAW,2012-10-08 00:30:00,4022,Great shot!  Sure wish the colours in my bush looked like that.  All the leaves this year just died and fell to the ground.  No really nice colours.
735112,Moosebunk,2012-10-08 00:48:00,3970,"It was rumored this years colors wouldn't be up to standard due to basically a summer od drought.  Driving today in the Lanark Highlands I'll beg to differ.  But that said, probaby the best I have ever seen for fall colors is where Paul was out taking pictures today.  Hard to beat the Gatineau.  Lots of maples in both places, and they make the best colors.  Nice shot dood!"
