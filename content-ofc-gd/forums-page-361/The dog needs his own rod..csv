735847,fishnsled,2012-10-11 14:36:00,3520,"Roloff better watch those hooks as he sniffing those fish.  Great companion you have there Simon and some nice fish to boot! A shame about the paint on the rock. Is it marking something, other than your fishing spot  or just graffiti?"
735851,limeyangler,2012-10-11 14:53:00,5204,"  Yup life is good Rick. Your shore fishing should be going insane right about now eh?    GRAFFITI!!!!!

735855,manitoubass2,2012-10-11 15:12:00,11391,"I get no fishing pressure at my shore spots Simon, but I do often arrive to some empty jugs of alcohol, all from the same two people over and over again.  A month back, one of them musta got the doghouse by the missus, cause they decided to kick in the door on my ice fishing shack.  So I feel your frustration, lol  As for fishing, the shiner runs been going on for awhile now. Walleye are getting better and better number wise, as well as size wise. Another week or two and it will be bonkers again. I'm excited, its an awesome time of year for cowbeenas, and because alot of them are near shore, the kids get to join in the fun!  Unlike you though, I gotta tie my pups up. If I dangled fish in front of my dogs they'll eat them up right away, lol. Something about those huskies right before winter, lol."
