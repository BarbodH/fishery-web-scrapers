735440,DanD,2012-10-09 19:15:00,2223," Thanks for the info Lew. Last time we were there (2 years ago), they were promoting the lots they had for sale; but nothing was said about them selling everything. If they do sell I sure hope the new owners try and keep the same atmosphere going. You didn’t see or hear from any of the owners or the staff; but at the same time if you ask for something they bent over backwards to get it done for you. What I mean is that you’re left alone to do your own thing and not bugged by them, by being in your face all the time.  Dan."
735446,Terry,2012-10-09 19:45:00,14456,great report and great photos  looks like a great time
735447,lew,2012-10-09 20:03:00,12766," Our 1st time there was about 4 years ago and we stayed in cabin 10 which is boat access only. First evening the BBQ didn't work so I called the office and they said they'd be right over to check it.  It was literally only about 3 minutes after my call and here comes Frank around the bend in his boat. I met him at the dock and said ""What the heck took you so long""  He couldn't fix it but had a new BBQ on our porch within minutes.  Fantastic service for sure."
735448,davey buoy,2012-10-09 20:06:00,5505," What else could you ask for?,sounds like a 5star plus !!!!. Would love to go there sometime."
735540,motv8tr,2012-10-10 11:06:00,2587,"Joey, those pictures are Amazing!!!  You have a great eye.  My favorite is the one with the large cloud with the sun peeking out behind it....my first thought was that it looks like a huge Eagle....great shot.  Glad you guys had a great week and those were some nice fish...  Maureen"
735598,Joey,2012-10-10 14:51:00,9122," Thanks Terry, it really was a nice week up there, and I'd definately go back!   Yup, 5 star for sure, thanks Davey Buoy!    Thanks Mo, that picture was first thing in the morning, with the sun rising, just after the mist had dissipated.  It was a ""crisp"" morning for sure, and as the sun rose on one side, the moon was setting on the next.  I got pics of that too, but they were not so enlightening"
735609,lew,2012-10-10 15:28:00,12766,I just went through your post again Joey and this picture really is fantastic. 
735625,Joey,2012-10-10 17:07:00,9122,"Thanks Lew, that is one of my faves too.  I actually sent in my photos for print yesterday (you know, old school style   ) and had that one blown up to 8 x 10"
735628,RangerGuy,2012-10-10 17:11:00,564,"Awesome report Joey, some really cool pics.  Looks like I just missed U & Paul again DOH! We got up there on Saturday morning."

735666,RangerGuy,2012-10-10 19:49:00,564,ah man! that sucks LOL!  I couldn't believe how well our little suzuki handled the Alaskan.. I wouldn't tow with it regularly but i did a fine job
735667,woodenboater,2012-10-10 19:50:00,2277,"but I get Cabin 9, just saying  Been watching property on the West Arm and some seems to just sit there, like the island across from Shuswap. Also some islands near Muskrat for sale and the price (compared to south Ont.) for Memquisit is a steal. I mean c'mon, 294 acres for  $2 000 000 ??? In a heartbeat, if I won Lottomax.  btw, is there enough current in the Arm to make ice fishing a dicey proposition ?"
735674,lew,2012-10-10 20:06:00,12766,  Here ya go  
735009,Roy,2012-10-07 10:56:00,13728,"Beauty report! Wish I could have been there Joey. Your pics are getting better and better all the time. You have some super shots there. Is it just me or does it look like you're using poor little Ralphie as bait out on the walking trails on the end of a line?  As you know, I've never been to Memquisit although I pass by there all the time....it looks wonderful. And here's a question, Memquisit appears to be built on granite but the cabin you stayed in is on a concrete foundation? I don't think I've ever seen that before.  Again, great report, super pics and I'm really glad you two had a good time.  Oh, and never thought I'd ever say this but thank Paul for the extra 6 inches."
735019,NBR,2012-10-07 13:19:00,163,Great pictures. You have a real talent with the camera!
735020,Joey,2012-10-07 13:19:00,9122," Thanks JoshS!   Thanks Phil, will we be seeing you at LSC this year?   Thanks hon, I wish you could have been there too.  Yes, Ralphie leads the way first in case of wolves or bears  As for the cabins, the one we stayed in used to be the previous owners' permanent home, so it has a good foundation and is heated by oil.  All the others are on ""stilts"" and are heated by propane.  Actually, the website has a description of each cabin, it is very imformative and gives the history etc.  As for Paul and his extra six inches, well that's between the two of you"
735021,aplumma,2012-10-07 13:20:00,6896,"Very nice report and looks like a good time was had by all. Is I looked at the pictures of the walk in the woods I though ""Joey's bearbaiting"" lol but I know that bear would have to come thru you before he got close to ralphy.    Art"
735028,Skud,2012-10-07 14:01:00,739,Looked like a great getaway. Sweet pics too. Where did you get the cool T-shirt with the warrior Babe on it? My daughters loves that stuff
735031,Joey,2012-10-07 14:22:00,9122," Thank you NBR!   Thanks Art, and you got that right, the bear would be a hurtin animal if he tried to get my Ralphie    Ya, it was a really nice getaway for sure Skud.  The cool T-shirt, I got at the French River Trading Post, but the company is called ""The Mountain"" and they make really neat t-shirts.  The one I have is a wood nymph and is my favorite shirt.  Her name is Crystalline and I've sewn more than a few holes in this shirt already.  Here is the link and they still carry that shirt if you want to order it for your daughter!!   The Mountain T-Shirts"

735194,Joey,2012-10-08 14:14:00,9122," Thanks B, it was a real treat to see the harvest moon coming up while out on the water    Thanks Dax   Thanks Sour Squirrel    Thanks Paul, I was happy to see the smaller pickerel too.  That means they are reproducing and they'll hopefully grow up to be bigguns"

735353,DanD,2012-10-09 11:56:00,2223,"Very nice report and like many have said your pictures are assume. We’ve stayed at Memquisit on two different occasions for our summer’s week away. One of the things I like the most about Memquisit is its location; it’s kind of the midpoint on the West Arm. Just last week I was thinking of booking there again for this coming summer and came across a Royal Le Page listing that the lodge is up for sale; was there any mention of this by the owners or staff, while you were there? http://www.sellingthenorth.com/listings/l0085.html  Dan."
735360,lew,2012-10-09 12:28:00,12766,"It was for sale last year too Dan along with the rest of the surrounding property. There were for sale signs every couple hundred feet to the east and then up and around the east end.  This year they've removed all the signs and evidently they've decided not to sell it as a bunch of different properties but as only 1 or 2 packages.  It's a gorgeous area and personally, I'd hate to see a bunch of cabins ....or monster homes along those shores.  I've also stayed there a couple times and it's really nice."
735407,mepps,2012-10-09 15:32:00,1301,"Great report, beautiful photos!"
735437,Joey,2012-10-09 19:08:00,9122,"Thanks guys, and yes, it is for sale.  We talked to the owner about price and how many acres he had etc.  We actually noticed ALOT of places up there for sale, including Lakair Lodge and the main corner store in Lavigne, aswell as many, many homes and cottages.  The only two private cottages on Muskrat Bay are both for sale.  It's kind of heartbreaking to think that many of the places need to sell.  Not sure the reasoning, but it must have been a hard decision to put them up for sale."
734908,Joey,2012-10-06 22:01:00,9122,"For the first time, Paul and I stayed at Memquisit Lodge on the West Arm of Lake Nipissing.  We had a great week in the beautiful fall weather watching the trees turn colour and lose their leaves.  And of course we fished  I started preparing all week and on Friday, I went to Costco for the last of my groceries, some Big Steaks!!!  Upon scouring the meat aisle at Costco, I noticed there were no steaks and asked what had happened.  The meat guy told me that due to the e.coli recall of beef from XL Foods, they were not selling them that day and sales of meat were pending, hmmmmmmm.  Okay, off to Metro and bought two big T-bones, went home and packed the cooler for the morning.  Doing some last minute reading online, I see Metro had pulled all their beef aswell - Dang!!!!   Okay, well I'll leave those steaks here and return them when I get back.  Hit Longos first thing Saturday morning, as check in at Memquisit was not until 3 p.m., so we had plenty of time.  I did ask the meat dept at Longos if they also bought from XL Foods and they said yes, but the steaks they had now (Saturday the 29th) were fine.  Hmmmmmmm, okay, I'll take two Strip Loin please (they had no t-bones).  Finally, some Turf to go with our Surf!!!  We arrived around 3 p.m. and unpacked and ordered up some wood for the campfire and ice for the cooler.  Spend a nice evening by the fire.  Our home for the week!    This was our wall art, looks to be about 55 inches:     Got up Sunday morning and headed out for some musky fishing.  As we're casting, I hear my cell phone ring, it's my mom ""do not eat the steaks!!!""  Apparently it was all over the news that meat up to and including the 29th has been recalled due to e.coli.  Sheesh, can't catch a steak break    In the freezer the Longo's steaks go for a return when we get home  Anyhow, back to fishing, Paul caught a pike that morning.    It was bitterly cold that morning aswell, poor Ralphie.  I'll have to get him some proper cold weather gear.     We went out for pickerel later that night and Paul caught 2 pickerel and a perch and I caught a bluegill.         Then I caught something small, and as I'm reeling in, all of a sudden it felt huge.  I get it almost to the boat and Paul has the net ready and it is a big pickerel that decided it wanted the perch on the end of my line more than I did!!!  It quickly let go and all I ended up with was a chewed up perch!!!  We headed out Monday morning again for Musky and had no takers, caught nothing, not even pike.  Headed out for pickerel again in the evening and I caught 3 and a perch, Paul caught a clam      Snapped a few fall colour shots.       Saw the beautiful harvest moon on the way back and snapped a few photos.             Had a nice evening by the fire with the guys in the cabin next to us.   As per our usual routine, we went out for musky in the morning, but this time we were rewarded  Paul caught a nice 46""er right off the bat.         We continued casting and I finally got a nice fat girl on, I estimate 42 to 44 inches.  As I'm reeling her in I see she has one hook barely attached to her lip. I was as careful as I could be reeling her in, but she did a dive under the boat, came up, went completely airborn, then dove again and was off - heartbreak!!!!  Oh well, it was fun to fight her and watch her do her acrobatics!!  I ended up catching a pike after that and Paul caught 3 more pike.      Our pickerel fish that night produced only small perch.  We went for a musky fish Wednesday morn with no taker, but it was a beautiful, crisp morning and I got a few pics of the mist on the lake and the sun rising.           We decided to go into Lavigne for supplies, including hopefully steak.  The clerk at the main store in Lavigne said there was a farm up the road about a mile that sold organic steak, so we beelined it there and were disappointed once again when they said they were sold out, but had some nice pork chops!!!  No pickerel again tonight but small perch.  Rained the rest of the night and all the next day off and on.  Thursday we fished with the tarp up in the rain trolling and caught 8 pike.  Only took a pic of one:    Took a long troll all the way back to the lodge and noticed we marked alot of suspended fish, which we assumed were pickerel, so after a quick lunch we headed back out, this time using small gear for pickerel trolling.  Of course, as we changed gear to 8 lb test and pickerel lures, I catch a musky    I'm not complaining tho!!   We continued to troll till dark but had no pickerel takers.  Friday was our last day to fish and we headed out for musky once again in the morning.  Got two pike each but it was very windy and we were limited to where we could fish.  I did see an eagle tho        That was the second eagle I saw up there for the week, but was surprised I didn't see one Osprey or heron??    Did some more pickerel fishing at night and I got a nice, decent pickerel for a change, but alas, in the slot     I caught one more smaller pickerel, and Paul caught a mini pickerel and a perch.  We kept no fish this trip, all returned to get bigger        And, of course the sunset     We called it a night as it was freezing and the wind had still not abated.  Here are some random shots:                        One of the things I liked about this place were the many nature paths to walk on.  Ralphie and I decided this one was our favorite!!                       My new shirt, it says ""Largemouth""  and then has an arrow to the fish and says ""and a picture of a bass""  Hahahahahahaha!    Spent our last night around the campfire roasting marshmallows, then packed up this morning and headed back, enjoying the beautiful fall colours in the trees all the way home  Was a great trip and I would return to Memquisit again.  The owners were nice hosts and very accomodating!!!  Hope you enjoyed the report and pics.  Joey"
734909,Christopheraaron,2012-10-06 22:11:00,3525,Nice fish! To bad you didn't get any steaks or eyes though.
734910,Handlebarz,2012-10-06 22:13:00,3790,Awesome report I hope Paul did not use up all his musky mojo he will need it in a few weeks
734912,Handlebarz,2012-10-06 22:13:00,3790,Btw the first moon shot was killer I also like the leaf.

734918,Rich Clemens,2012-10-06 22:38:00,3131,Holly cow ...  I didn't know you guys were heading back up again. Some great shots and one of these years I need to delay our trip a couple weeks and enjoy the great fall colors.  They were just getting started when we were up a few weeks ago.   Wishin I could have been up there with ya.
734919,woodenboater,2012-10-06 22:39:00,2277,"Bummer about the beef situation and 2x bummer about the hit and miss fishing. Not surprised to hear you liked the place, have friends who've been going there for who knows how long and may try it for a luxe week of r&r. Love the photo of Ralphie (well lots of your photos really) all bundled up looking like he's wondering what happened to summer lol."
734922,Live2fish85,2012-10-06 22:43:00,1633,Awesome report Joey.  That picture with the leaf in the water is amazing.
734923,Joey,2012-10-06 22:50:00,9122," Thanks Mike, I'm loving my new lens.  And I'm sure Paul has a bit of Musky Mojo left.  Me too for that matter    Thanks Chris!   Thanks Davey Buoy, it really is a piece of heaven up there, and Memquisit was a nice spot and would be great for summer with the nice beach too!   Thanks Dan!   Thanks Lew, I knew you were waiting.  Love the new camera lens, it takes some pretty crisp pictures when the moment is right.  I need to learn a few things tho, like taking pics in dark, overcast light etc.  In time tho, all in time!   I bet she'll love the shirt, I think it's hilarious.  Thanks Spincast!    We were not real sure we were going to be going either Rich, but the stars aligned for us.  I wish you had of been with us too, I'm out of coke gummies     We may  have to coordinate our vacation times in 2013 eh!!    Thanks Woodenboater, ya, I was a bit bummed but the rest of the vaca made up for it!  I love that photo of Ralphie too"
734925,Joey,2012-10-06 22:52:00,9122," Thanks bud, I actually took several leaf in the water pics until I got the one I wanted.  That one fit the bill"

734965,bigcreekdad,2012-10-07 02:06:00,546,"Joey  Wonderful report, and even better pics!! I'm jealous....I had hoped to hit the French this week , but even my part time work screws things up occasionally. Hard to believe, it will be at least 6 months before I get up that way again.  Just curious....how were the cabins at Memquist?  Take Care"
734969,Joey,2012-10-07 02:09:00,9122," Thanks Jim, my fave place to fish also    Thanks sweetie, and no need to comment, I know"
734970,Joey,2012-10-07 02:19:00,9122," Thanks Bigcreekdad, sorry to hear you can't make it up  As for the cabins, all I can say is ""Rustic.""  They are by no means new and we did go around and look at a few others while there, but honestly, they were well kept as far as roof upkeep, heat, kitchen and washroom facilities.  The beds all had clean sheets and Hudson's Bay blankets.  They all had TV's with DVD players, BBQ's with propane, a fire pit, a dock and a deck with chairs and also a picnic table near the campfires.  We really didn't need anything else, never watched anything on the TV, just mostly fished and ate outside or sat by the campfire or went on nature walks.  We did get wifi, but only because our cabin was so close to the main lodge that has satellite.  Not sure if that was a good or bad thing, but we were hardly in the cabin to use it anyhow.  They do have a game room with pool table in the main lodge, and a gym with equipment.  Also they have a menu for Breakfast and Supper, but you have to reserve 24 hours in advance and they were not open for that at this time of year.  The panelling on the walls of most cabins did kind of remind me of the 70's, but that worked out well because the only radio channel we could tune in to when in the cabin played 70's music"
734996,JoshS,2012-10-07 03:50:00,729,Some beautiful shots you've taken there! Thanks for sharing.
