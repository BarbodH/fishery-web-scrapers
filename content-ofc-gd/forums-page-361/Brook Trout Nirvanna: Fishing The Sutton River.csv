Had a strong Dick Proenneke -esq feel to it and a way of taking you along the way for the trip. I must have read this thing 5 times through the first wk it was up. Nice report. thanx for the experience."
730210,lew,2012-09-16 16:45:00,12766,"Just finished reading thru this entire story once again and it truly was an adventure of a life time.  The run-in the polar bear is something neither of you will ever forget but it must have been an incredible thing to actually experience.  I've been close to polar bears myself, but they were on the other side of the steel fence at the Toronto Zoo and that was scary enough  Once again Bill & Mike, thanks for the incredible story and pictures !!!!"

So many thoughtful replies, thank you!  Many of you guys had questions and I really don't want to answer them all on this post. Please pm me directly and I'll get back to you asap!  Cheers,  Mike"
730340,Musky or Specks,2012-09-16 23:54:00,2710,Has the wife cleaned your underwear yet or did she make you do it. I think I would have left a pretty healthy load in my drawers coming face 2 face with a polar bear

Thanks you so much for this!!!!   Darren"
730368,S.M.05,2012-09-17 01:05:00,145,Have read through this report several times now to convince myself not to visit this unreal river called the Sutton. So far I have only convinced myself that I will fight all polar bears with one hand tied behind my back in order to get my line in that river.  This is the one report I needed to read this year. Fantastic report Mike

I think the polar bear story would be great to hear sitting around some burning sticks and a couple of mugs of Baileys   You have time to work on it before next year's Lakair G2G lol   Thanks for a terrific hour to start my day !  :worthy:
730506,solopaddler,2012-09-17 14:35:00,8605," Don't worry buddy, I'll be ready. I've been sorting through and readying my gear this morning.

730664,bicephalic,2012-09-18 00:41:00,112,Mike..Bill...hats off.  Admittedly I haven't read every word yet because I couldnt stop scrolling through the pictures.  Truly a trip of a lifetime.

730688,BillM,2012-09-18 01:41:00,17367," You can't really compare them, it's a completely different type of fishing..  I'll still get excited when I hook a 12in brookie in a small Grey/Bruce stream..  The Sutton won't take away any of that..  I get excited about spending time on the river with buddies, having good days and lots of laughs, fish are just a bonus"

What a fantastic adventure this must have been.  Obviously something you'll never forget and frankly sharing this with us gives us all a bit of a taste of what it must have been like.   Thank you so much for sharing and spending the time to do so.  It is much appreciated !!

Mike, I happened to get up in the middle of the night to check what was happening on the board. I wasn't here 2 minutes and this thread showed up. That was around 3 this morning and I could not go back to bed. I had to read it all (yes, made a pot of coffee) and savoured every word and picture. This is just a fantastic account of two guys doing what most fishing enthusiasts dream of doing. The difference is, you guys grabbed the bull by the ummm whatevers and did it. I see the word 'jealousy' show up but I'm sure that most mean to say envy. Envy you the trip but probably more importantly, envy you your conviction to just get it done. Lots can't do that. You both did it and also documented the whole journey including great photography and video. Your generosity sharing this to us all is to be commended. Just a great report guys.  Thanks guys....I really don't know what else to say.  ps. I'll PM Bill with a question though..... it has to do with bears."

It's definitely something I'd really love to save up for in the future. I'd love to try out a switch rod on that water for swinging flies and chugging mouse patterns across the surface...It just looks like what heaven should be like
729448,solopaddler,2012-09-13 00:07:00,8605,"Wow, I'm a little humbled at the response everyone, I'm so glad you like the story!  I'm about to crash, I've been up for three straight days now with little sleep, basically since I woke up Sunday morning. It's been a combination of my crazy work schedule and other things going on this week.  I'm heading up north early tomorrow morning with my son and dog, we're going up to the camp for a mini holliday.  When my brain is a little less frazzled I'll respond individually as many of you had questions.  Thanks again. A ton of work went into this one and it's real nice to see it's appreciated.  Cheers!"

729464,ehg,2012-09-13 00:40:00,2666,"Took me an hour to read this through the day. One of the greatest fishing stories have read and watched.  The whole deal from wildlife, geography, history, and of course weather and fishing are touched upon. Being there is what is special about this. The fact that you took the time to selflessly share with all is very admirable.  Passed through my mind that i had met both of you before you met each other. Made this adventure more ""real"" than some magazine article or fishing show on TV.  You and Bill deserve this. Nice guys finish first  not last.  Many thanks!"
729468,iFish4real,2012-09-13 01:04:00,386,Didn't know Canada gets that good How the hack were you able to actually SLEEP in the tent with all the polar bears around?

729480,Moosebunk,2012-09-13 01:39:00,3970,"Nice catching up a little the other night Mike.  Let's not leave it too long ti'll next time.  Thoroughly enjoyed the report, of course.  Special interests obviously... and so many first-hand stories from others about that place.  There's never been a person met from Peawanuck I didn't like, they are the most genuine folk and true to their roots.  Unspoiled.  Never met Albert while up north, but did talk with his brother Xavier about the Sutton once when he was in Moose Factory, and his sister Margaret (RN) a number of times.  She told the same story you did, about gliding over the schools of trout while going down the river.  Also, mentioned the new weeds.  Kinda sad really, knowing that it won't be the same way forever after having been the same way for eons.  Pike might begin to overrun some parts in time, but you and Bill surely tell that there's gotta be a billion specks in that river to keep it troutful.  I have 3 river regrets after leaving the north... Kwetabohagan, the Moose all the way to Hell's Gate, and this river.  So close, but never a partner willing to share it with.  You and Bill are so lucky, and it's more than a treat to see all the pics from the land.  Not quite what I had envisioned, a little less tundra, pretty well taiga, and very much like the Ekwan.  Howled at the Bill's pregnant comment... Appreciated the many pics and rundown of events.  Thanks, and well done gents!"
729486,FisherJuli,2012-09-13 02:03:00,125,"That was a fabulous report to read- and a superb mix of National Geographic, Virgin radio, and fish tv to make me awe-inspired! I am sure that the people, the wildlife and the terrain were rewarding in ways we would have to experience ourselves, and can only dream of. You're two very lucky guys- tho I am waffling on whether that includes the fish allergy and polar bears!!!"
729498,Mike the Pike,2012-09-13 03:02:00,3421,Thanks so much for taking the time to post and write about the adventure.One of your best reports for sure.  That truly is a trip of a life time.

729509,Skud,2012-09-13 03:41:00,739,Unbelievable fishing report. You must not have slept for the past three days putting that together. Great to see you and Bill living the dream. I may just have to put that trip on my bucket list.

Just the right amount to keep me glued to keep reading. What an amazing trip you guys had! Absolutely stellar boys.  I do have to say though, you guys are Basterds. I was content to try brook trout on Nipigon until I read this report! LOL Now I HAVE to go to both Nipigon AND the Sutton! As you know Mike, I have not fished much brook trout before but have always wanted to. I will have to go to both places, as the Sutton is now added to my bucket list like many others here now lol."

I couldn't imagine coming that close to a polar bear, i would literally have to clean my drawers after that for sure! but then quickly get back to the fishfest, pantless of course.  The chronzy shore lunch looks damn good! I do feel bad for Bill tho, eating trailmix and you got fresh cooked slab on your plate!! lol  totally jealous...again!"

729341,Musky or Specks,2012-09-12 15:39:00,2710,Well Mike that was fantastic and its truly a shame to share it with only the OFC community you really should submit that for publishing. Now my complaint. Not only did you get to do this wonderful trip and experience probably the best brook trout fishing in the world but NO PORTAGES!?!?!?!? My jealousy knows no bounds! I think I'm going to have to start saving I want to share this trip with my son. As you felt this was like having to do a project for school I'll give a A++ but have to remove one plus for tardiness. I think I speak for all who will read this report and say    Bill you did a great job as photographer.
729342,mercman,2012-09-12 15:39:00,7054,"Mike, you are a special guy.Love your reports.Thanks for sharing."
729347,asdve23rveavwa,2012-09-12 15:54:00,2690,"Thanks for sharing an adventure of a lifetime Mike and Bill. What an amazing lunchtime read.  The beauty of a brook trout is what draws me to them, and, seeing so many beautiful specimens in pristine waters...absolutely priceless!! Loved the bit about Bill eating some fish, at least he got a taste.  Epic, spectacular, amazing, awe inspiring, but, most of all, just a great tale of two friends enjoying nature."
729351,adempsey,2012-09-12 16:07:00,1498,Thanks for putting together that MEGA report and taking us along on your adventures.  Definitely an amazing trip that many of us will never have the opportunity to experience.  I can't believe Bill ate fish even though he is allergic!  Luckily he didn't go into anaphylactic shock!  Definitely not the place for that.
729352,BillM,2012-09-12 16:15:00,17367," I've had fish before, I knew exactly what the reaction was going to be like.  I was hoping some of those fresh fish from the ocean wouldn't bother me (I can eat saltwater fish, just not freshwater)..  Unfortunately my experiment didn't work!  Although it tasted fantastic!"

729358,Hooked,2012-09-12 16:50:00,891,"Wow, that was more than a fishing report, that was an excellent short story.  I couldn't imagine the crazy #'s of fish you guys put up, amazing!  Are there any other species that swims in those waters?  Great stuff."
729361,l2p,2012-09-12 16:51:00,346,An hour well spent! thanks Mike and Bill for sharing!
729374,kickingfrog,2012-09-12 18:04:00,8333,"Well, if time spent fishing is not deducted from our life; I hope that hour or so I just spent will not be deducted from mine, and if it is, it was worth it.   I'll take sentences you won't hear on a remote fly-in fishing trip for a thousand Alex.  ""I can't believe you were just greased out by some rube flossing fish with a marshmallow on the Sutton!!"""

729402,misfish,2012-09-12 20:22:00,29133,"I started reading this report Mike at 11:30,my lunch time.

I heard this voice,are you going back to work? it was a half hour past the end of the lunch break    No worries though.  THAT SIR,WAS ONE HELL OF A READ. WHAT A TRIP. Now that I have seen the pics and vids,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,  :worthy:  :worthy:    I would also like to add,this report should be narrated.It has that feeling in the writting.  Great trip guys.

729306,Live2fish85,2012-09-12 13:20:00,1633,All I can say is holy crap. That was an amazing report.  Mike you truely know how to write a report and make it feel as if we were right there with you. By far the best report I have ever read. You should have it published some where in some magazine or something.  Thanks for sharing Mike and Bill.  I hope to make that trip some day and as there is no portaging it is something I will hopefully experience.  Thanks again for sharing.

I can see why you would want to go back and explore the ""Sutton Ridges"" I bet there is some giants swimmin around in there ! Thanks for taking us along with you and Bill on your adventure through your stories and pictures , well done"
729315,NAW,2012-09-12 14:14:00,4022,"Amazing trip guys!!  And great pics and write up as well.  No kidding about being paralized by a slug gun blasting off.  I've been down muzle of them before, and it takes a minute regain your self..  Scary stuff, but one for the memory banks"
