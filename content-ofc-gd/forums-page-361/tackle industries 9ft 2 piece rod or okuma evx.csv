735425,FinS,2012-10-09 17:03:00,463,looking at the tackle industries 9ft 2 pc MH paired with a 400 cardiff i will mostly be casting bulldawgs and bondy baits along with some Double 10's  any good on these rods what about warranty  also looking into the okuma evx musky rods model #EVx-C-741H   any input will be great  reason for the 2 pc is more for transportation and storage purpose
735426,ttahhan,2012-10-09 17:19:00,191,Hi there did a little digging and here's some Tackle Industries Info:  Review  
735427,Dan668,2012-10-09 17:21:00,1120,I just bought the telescopic 9' xh split handle. Works great for double tens.
735428,mepps,2012-10-09 17:30:00,1301,"Hey FinS, as far as I know there are not 2 piece Tackle Industries rods (just checked the site, didnt see any).  I am a huge fan of my TI rod though, casts big lures with ease! If you are in the TO area, you can come take a look at it, though I have no interest in selling mine.  Thanks for the link TS!"

735435,Dan668,2012-10-09 18:33:00,1120,2 PC just came out. I picked up the telescopic. Goes from 9 ft to 7'6 as my boat only stores a max of 8'
735443,Handlebarz,2012-10-09 19:24:00,3790,Fin I have the 9' telescopic rod it's good for the $$$ like I was saying to you at the swamp its heavy but does the job. It has held up to all of my casting fish this year using bulldogs bondys Handlebarz jerk baits.
735457,mepps,2012-10-09 20:52:00,1301,"Well thats just great, now I need to buy another rod!"
735547,Harrison,2012-10-10 12:21:00,2202,eTackle.ca is the Canadian distributor for these rods. Our last order of TI rods sold out.  We have a couple Jerkbait rods left and will possibly be putting in another order this fall.  When we know for sure we'll post in the Announcements section and offer our regular OFC discounts!!  Will will offer pre-order special pricing.  Okuma's are a solid rod as well.
