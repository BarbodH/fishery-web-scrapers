735560,ttahhan,2012-10-10 13:08:00,191,That is a hard choice.....if push comes to shove i would go for Pike
735562,azebra,2012-10-10 13:09:00,168,If try fly fishing for a big pike! Or centerpin with a big minnow on a huge floatThere is plenty of months ahead to get a big rainbow.

735617,Gallie,2012-10-10 16:03:00,1215,Go pike! I would be out there now if my motor was running
735868,Rich,2012-10-11 16:03:00,3927,Well I chose wisely apparently.. hit a local trib and landed my PB steelhead on a musky buck! Gotta love fall.. next time some pike will get a piercing
