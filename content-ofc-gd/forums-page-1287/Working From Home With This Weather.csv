22613,Cast-Away,2007-01-15 13:33:00,790,"I'm really lucky that the company gave me a laptop back in the summer, so on a day light today, I am plugged in and working from my family room, watching all of the neighbours go by in their vehicles to work!  What a crappy day to have to drive anywhere.  Be careful out there everyone."
22636,Eddyk,2007-01-15 14:07:00,195,What about the people who have to work in this weather let alone driving in it.
22638,lew,2007-01-15 14:11:00,12767,Days like this make retirement even more glorious !!  Think I'll go pour another coffee and put my feet up ........again
22641,Mike Pike,2007-01-15 14:20:00,1332,"I'm kinda in the same boat as you, Cast-Away.  I work in Waterloo but when the weather gets rough, I can work from my 'home office' in Hamilton.  I still went to work this morning, though, cuz I didn't think it was too bad out there.  I did see a few accidents though.  And Lew, that's just plain mean."

22658,Cast-Away,2007-01-15 14:46:00,790,"I turned from freezing rain to snow here in Newmarket about half an hour ago. The garbage truck just went by picking up Christmas trees. He must be happy, because if the freezing rain kept up, all of the trees would freeze to the ground."
22682,ccmtcanada,2007-01-15 15:27:00,7971,"I'm working here at home today...nice thing about an office job!  I had work emailed home first thing this morning...only had to cancel one meeting.  Even Go Trains were delayed this morning, so instead of spending all day on the road, this is better!"
22735,irishfield,2007-01-15 17:19:00,26272,"I'm ""working"" at home today as well. Kinda ""Lew"" style....LOL"
22785,TJQ,2007-01-15 19:38:00,7806,I walk to my office every day...
